[00:00.000 --> 00:02.200]  Uh, where do we even start then?
[00:03.700 --> 00:08.400]  Yeah, I, I was actually kind of optimistic we could just avoid watch discussion.
[00:08.800 --> 00:13.040]  Um, possibly I don't know, well, well, then that article dropped today.
[00:13.040 --> 00:16.800]  But yeah, it's, it's almost like, at this point, it's like, I just want, it's, it's,
[00:16.800 --> 00:19.200]  I just want to come out and then let's talk about it.
[00:19.680 --> 00:26.800]  Um, but, but no, uh, Apple via wired had to drop a sack of turd on the front porch.
[00:26.800 --> 00:32.720]  So we're recording on Thursday, April 2nd shows probably going to come out tomorrow
[00:32.720 --> 00:33.200]  Friday.
[00:33.200 --> 00:42.800]  Um, so we're still in this like void between three weeks ago was this event.
[00:43.840 --> 00:48.240]  Three weeks from now is when real people will start getting to watch.
[00:49.040 --> 00:54.320]  We're still a full week away from the watch beam being in the stores for people to look at with their own eyes.
[00:54.320 --> 01:03.840]  Right, like right now, the 99.999% of people who are interested in Apple watch have not seen one in person.
[01:04.560 --> 01:05.120]  Right, right.
[01:05.120 --> 01:07.520]  I mean, it's, you go out a lot of nines on that.
[01:08.080 --> 01:08.960]  I don't totally.
[01:09.120 --> 01:12.320]  Um, it's only been at the two events.
[01:12.320 --> 01:12.720]  Right.
[01:12.720 --> 01:14.720]  Well, I guess no, because people are wearing them in public, I guess.
[01:14.720 --> 01:20.240]  Okay, combined with employees, but I'm sure though, and even people who glance it on employees
[01:20.240 --> 01:24.320]  with testing units out in the wild, um, you can do that.
[01:24.320 --> 01:27.600]  But I'm sure that if you say, hey, is that an Apple watch that they'll say, yes,
[01:27.600 --> 01:31.040]  but then I'm sure that this they've got like a standard reply that's more or less,
[01:31.040 --> 01:34.320]  but I can't show it to you and say they're not allowed to like, that's exactly right.
[01:34.320 --> 01:35.920]  They're not allowed to let people examine it.
[01:35.920 --> 01:40.640]  Um, but it's interesting.
[01:40.640 --> 01:44.160]  Like to me, I've been talking about it in the last few weeks is why in the world would
[01:44.160 --> 01:45.600]  Apple schedule things this way?
[01:45.600 --> 01:48.480]  And I think that the article today is part why.
[01:48.480 --> 01:51.360]  I think that they wanted.
[01:51.360 --> 01:57.040]  They didn't want the cycle like with a regular revision where it's event.
[01:57.040 --> 02:01.680]  Next week reviews two days later, go buy it, right?
[02:01.680 --> 02:07.680]  Like this 10 day cycle of most of their, you know, um, we would call flagship products.
[02:07.680 --> 02:11.840]  You know, new iPhones come out on an event on a.
[02:11.840 --> 02:22.240]  Use a Monday or Tuesday, uh, then the reviews come out a week later and then like on a Wednesday,
[02:22.240 --> 02:24.800]  I think usually usually Tuesday or Wednesday.
[02:24.800 --> 02:29.520]  And then Fridays are always the day where people who've pre ordered will get theirs delivered
[02:29.520 --> 02:31.600]  and stores will have them and people can line up.
[02:31.600 --> 02:35.280]  It's like a, you know, 10 day cycle, 11 day cycle.
[02:35.280 --> 02:39.520]  The watch is way off of that and I can only guess that it's because they want to fill
[02:39.520 --> 02:46.160]  that space between last month's event and this month's release with a drum beat,
[02:46.160 --> 02:52.880]  a steady drum beat of stuff, promotional stuff, you know, good morning America, TV now this
[02:52.880 --> 02:55.120]  and wired.
[02:55.120 --> 02:59.200]  So today what, tell me what's the article we're talking about?
[02:59.200 --> 03:04.360]  So wired, uh, drop this article, uh, entitled iPhone killer, the secret history of the Apple
[03:04.360 --> 03:13.800]  Watch, um, and, uh, David Pierce, uh, wrote an article, um, where he clearly got clearly,
[03:13.800 --> 03:18.720]  you know, blessed Apple PR, he talked talk to people at Apple, he spent a lot of time, uh,
[03:18.720 --> 03:22.160]  with with the human air base designers, uh, day is an entered.
[03:22.160 --> 03:30.280]  I came out his name right now and I, Ellen died, um, and, and, uh, within any of these
[03:30.280 --> 03:36.480]  pieces and this is kind of the, the, the trouble with posting them is you, you don't
[03:36.480 --> 03:42.160]  know, like to what extent what is coming from Apple, um, what's coming from the spin that
[03:42.160 --> 03:46.480]  PR is giving him and then what have it, what if it's coming from, from, from Pierce.
[03:46.480 --> 03:53.120]  Um, but the, the kind of overarching theme of the article is that the, the real goal of
[03:53.120 --> 03:58.160]  the watch is to make you not need your iPhone so much and it's folks on the notifications
[03:58.160 --> 04:00.400]  and the idea that will free you from your phone.
[04:00.400 --> 04:05.720]  Um, I would, I would, I'm, I'm going to interrupt and I'm going to subtly tweak that and
[04:05.720 --> 04:12.280]  say that it's not so much that you don't need your iPhone, but that it, it, because it's
[04:12.280 --> 04:14.200]  all coming from the phone, right?
[04:14.200 --> 04:17.160]  It all only works if you're in Bluetooth range of the phone.
[04:17.160 --> 04:24.200]  So it's more like, uh, hmm, a dashboard to your phone.
[04:24.200 --> 04:28.200]  Well, I think it's, it's, it's more like, because they talked about like, like, like
[04:28.200 --> 04:32.240]  when she talked about in the article, he talked to Kevin Lynch, um, the idea of like, you
[04:32.240 --> 04:36.560]  can be playing with your kids and you can get an orification and, uh, you can glance at
[04:36.560 --> 04:37.760]  and realize it's not that important.
[04:37.760 --> 04:38.760]  You can keep doing what you're doing.
[04:38.760 --> 04:41.720]  You're not actually pulling out your pocket and filling with it and all that sort of stuff,
[04:41.720 --> 04:44.720]  which, which is hardly a, a, a new thesis.
[04:44.720 --> 04:50.440]  It's interesting that this seems to be the, the story that Apple is choosing to tell,
[04:50.440 --> 04:55.400]  but, um, I mean, frankly, I think that, uh, um, oh, and by the way, I think that they
[04:55.400 --> 05:01.000]  said at the event that the watch will work on your home Wi-Fi network, um, but I, I,
[05:01.000 --> 05:03.280]  I'm not 100% sure on that.
[05:03.280 --> 05:09.760]  Um, I think that that's only, but it's only, again, I came that, um, on a 100% sure,
[05:09.760 --> 05:14.720]  but I'm 99% sure that all that means though is, I think you're correcting me that as long
[05:14.720 --> 05:17.720]  as your, your phone and your watch are on the same Wi-Fi network.
[05:17.720 --> 05:18.720]  Right.
[05:18.720 --> 05:20.800]  Bluetooth is out of range, right?
[05:20.800 --> 05:21.800]  Yeah.
[05:21.800 --> 05:22.800]  Yeah.
[05:22.800 --> 05:23.800]  That's correct.
[05:23.800 --> 05:27.280]  You can say that your phone down like on the front, next to the front door or next
[05:27.280 --> 05:30.440]  to your bed and you can go around the house and your watch will have full, still have full
[05:30.440 --> 05:31.440]  functionality.
[05:31.440 --> 05:32.440]  Right.
[05:32.440 --> 05:33.440]  Right.
[05:33.440 --> 05:36.240]  And that the idea there, and it sounds great is that you can, you know, if you need to
[05:36.240 --> 05:40.960]  charge your phone or whatever, you can do it and, you know, go watch TV, two floors away
[05:40.960 --> 05:44.840]  from where it's charging and you're not, you're not going to be out of touch from notifications
[05:44.840 --> 05:45.840]  you're expecting.
[05:45.840 --> 05:46.840]  Right.
[05:46.840 --> 05:48.800]  And I just, I just looked at that, that, that's exactly what it is.
[05:48.800 --> 05:50.840]  So, um, yeah.
[05:50.840 --> 05:53.560]  So I think, I think you're probably, you're probably right.
[05:53.560 --> 05:57.200]  And if you think about the other, you know, app, because you have to think of this, not
[05:57.200 --> 06:02.680]  in terms of a normal Apple watch, but an Apple new product launch.
[06:02.680 --> 06:08.640]  And it was the case, uh, with, particularly the iPhone, but also the iPad that there was
[06:08.640 --> 06:14.280]  a big break between the introduction and, and the actual unveiling of the device.
[06:14.280 --> 06:17.280]  Like it's the iPhone, there was a second event as well, there was, there was, there was
[06:17.280 --> 06:18.280]  a D.C.
[06:18.280 --> 06:25.680]  Exactly, exactly, which was a good three weeks, um, before, before the phone as well.
[06:25.680 --> 06:29.280]  Um, so yeah, so I think big picture, you're probably right.
[06:29.280 --> 06:33.880]  Um, but I think this art, frankly, I think this article is a, is a PR disaster.
[06:33.880 --> 06:40.920]  I, I would not go that far, but I, I don't think it was good.
[06:40.920 --> 06:45.000]  Yeah, I mean, the, I mean, the killer line, which is already all over Twitter and stuff
[06:45.000 --> 06:50.880]  is, is this idea that Apple, um, decided they want to do a watch and they had to figure
[06:50.880 --> 06:57.920]  out what it was for, which kind of, um, confirms the worst suspicions that people, people
[06:57.920 --> 07:05.720]  had about the watch, um, in a, in a, you know, there's a very sort of non, not subtle
[07:05.720 --> 07:08.280]  way, a very blunt, blunt sort of way.
[07:08.280 --> 07:11.320]  And, and you know, of course, so like I said, you don't know what the balance is between
[07:11.320 --> 07:16.240]  Apple PR and what Apple employees said and, um, and what, what, what Pierce came up with,
[07:16.240 --> 07:20.840]  but, um, where is that line?
[07:20.840 --> 07:22.200]  It sounds, it sounds bad.
[07:22.200 --> 07:23.200]  Where is that line?
[07:23.200 --> 07:24.200]  I can't find it.
[07:24.200 --> 07:25.200]  Let me find it.
[07:25.200 --> 07:28.840]  It's, it's pretty close to the top.
[07:28.840 --> 07:32.800]  Maybe I don't have the, Apple decided to make a watch and only then set out to discover what
[07:32.800 --> 07:37.200]  it might be good for besides, you know, displaying the time, um, it's only these terrible
[07:37.200 --> 07:41.800]  web pages that has like the pictures and the text growing on top of it, which like theoretical
[07:41.800 --> 07:43.800]  looks good, but dries me up the wall.
[07:43.800 --> 07:44.800]  Yeah.
[07:44.800 --> 07:45.800]  It's, you know what?
[07:45.800 --> 07:49.600]  I read it on my phone and it was actually really good, like the most better on the phone.
[07:49.600 --> 07:50.600]  Yeah.
[07:50.600 --> 07:51.600]  I can save here.
[07:51.600 --> 07:55.640]  And now I'm looking at it in a desktop browser and it's a disaster for reading in my opinion.
[07:55.640 --> 07:56.640]  Yeah.
[07:56.640 --> 07:57.640]  So there's, there's two parts.
[07:57.640 --> 07:59.600]  The first one is that first, there's a big, at the top, Apple side and make a watch
[07:59.600 --> 08:02.480]  only that's helped discover to discover what it might be good for.
[08:02.480 --> 08:06.840]  Um, and then there's another line about Johnny I've, I've been dreaming about an Apple
[08:06.840 --> 08:15.680]  watch just after CEO Steve Jobs death and October 2011, and then it's basically like, um,
[08:15.680 --> 08:21.600]  insinuating that I've, yeah, I've began a deep investigation of horology, studying how
[08:21.600 --> 08:24.440]  reading the vision of the son of the, uh, horology became a session, the session became
[08:24.440 --> 08:28.920]  a product along the way the Apple team went and upon the watch reason to talk, it came
[08:28.920 --> 08:29.920]  down to this.
[08:29.920 --> 08:33.920]  And then they get the phone is ruining your wife, which, um, I definitely presume is, is
[08:33.920 --> 08:37.600]  Pierce's kind of summary of it, but like, it doesn't matter.
[08:37.600 --> 08:41.560]  This is on Apple and they're the one that's orchestrated this.
[08:41.560 --> 08:48.480]  And like I said, the problem is it's really feeding into all the worse, uh, or the most pessimistic
[08:48.480 --> 08:51.560]  kind of conceptions about the watch.
[08:51.560 --> 08:52.800]  Yeah.
[08:52.800 --> 08:58.400]  The line is Pierce's, it's not a quote, you know, here's the, this is just pros from
[08:58.400 --> 09:02.240]  Pierce to Apple decided to make a watch and only then set out to discover what it might
[09:02.240 --> 09:08.080]  be good for parentheses besides, you know, displaying the time, um, which is a weird thing
[09:08.080 --> 09:19.360]  to, to put in parentheses, because who says that it has to, that telling the time has to
[09:19.360 --> 09:21.240]  be a primary function, right?
[09:21.240 --> 09:29.060]  Now, and this is, the thing is, is like what's funny is, um, like the next sentence
[09:29.060 --> 09:32.120]  actually very much fits my feeling about the watch.
[09:32.120 --> 09:36.320]  And I think, I don't remember if it says in the podcast, I think I said it to, to before.
[09:36.320 --> 09:41.000]  Um, well, the quote is, there was a sent, this is a quote, there was a sense that technology
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.400]  was going to move on to the body says, Allen die who runs Apple's inner, human interface
[09:45.400 --> 09:46.400]  group.
[09:46.400 --> 09:49.080]  We felt like the natural place, the place it had historical relative significance was the
[09:49.080 --> 09:50.080]  wrist.
[09:50.080 --> 09:57.080]  So I mean, that's, that's my whole thesis for the watch as well, like it's the natural progression
[09:57.080 --> 10:02.240]  of, of technology, I mean, it keeps getting smaller and keeps eating more personal.
[10:02.240 --> 10:03.680]  And where do you go from the phone?
[10:03.680 --> 10:08.960]  Like the, the watch just seems the, the obvious place to go.
[10:08.960 --> 10:14.320]  And you know, I think the history of technology shows that personal and convenience, uh,
[10:14.320 --> 10:16.000]  uh, trumps anything.
[10:16.000 --> 10:19.840]  And that's, that actually is the reason to be, to be bullish.
[10:19.840 --> 10:26.440]  The problem is it wasn't, it's a subtle, it's a subtle point that requires putting in kind
[10:26.440 --> 10:32.760]  of historical context of technology and the way things, way things move and the way things
[10:32.760 --> 10:34.000]  will go over time.
[10:34.000 --> 10:39.400]  Like what happens when the watch has cellular radios, for example, um, and either Apple
[10:39.400 --> 10:45.680]  didn't do a good job of setting up that framing for Pierce or, or he ignored it.
[10:45.680 --> 10:51.080]  But read, but the fact of the matter is I actually think that's exactly right.
[10:51.080 --> 10:54.240]  But like, but it doesn't sound good.
[10:54.240 --> 10:57.640]  It's like the PR disaster.
[10:57.640 --> 11:03.040]  I have to go meta on the story before we talk about, I think there is a lot to talk about
[11:03.040 --> 11:09.560]  here with this feature story, but I have to go meta first about the story as opposed
[11:09.560 --> 11:12.960]  to the watch and the team and the decisions, you know, and I'm going to get this out of
[11:12.960 --> 11:13.960]  the way.
[11:13.960 --> 11:20.880]  I feel like I have to clear the decks is that it's, uh, complaining about the way that
[11:20.880 --> 11:26.320]  it's written is petty and caddy, but that's how we writers are.
[11:26.320 --> 11:29.240]  And there's a part of this where I think, holy shit, I could have done what's better
[11:29.240 --> 11:30.240]  job.
[11:30.240 --> 11:34.800]  If they would have given me a full day with Lynch and die and let me talk to them on the
[11:34.800 --> 11:38.200]  record extensively, I could have done a much better job.
[11:38.200 --> 11:44.880]  And I, that's, that's, that's what, as I'm reading the story, that's what I thought.
[11:44.880 --> 11:50.480]  And I got to the bottom and, uh, I thought, wow, this, they picked the wrong guy to give
[11:50.480 --> 11:54.880]  this access to, like to me, this was very, this is a very lightweight article.
[11:54.880 --> 12:00.240]  Do you ever get one of those, uh, there's a, uh, stay cast in Philly, uh, that has
[12:00.240 --> 12:03.920]  these great, when you get the bread before your meal, they're really big and it looks
[12:03.920 --> 12:05.840]  like holy shit, well, I could never eat that.
[12:05.840 --> 12:09.360]  That's this like muffin type bread thing and then you open it up, you open it up and there's
[12:09.360 --> 12:13.120]  nothing in the inside, right, you know, it's like, it's actually not a lot of bread.
[12:13.120 --> 12:17.840]  It's like some kind of thing that puffs up and like, uh, you know, like a more like a pastry
[12:17.840 --> 12:24.080]  than bread. That's what this article is like to me. It's very empty. Um, part of it, though,
[12:24.080 --> 12:28.160]  here's the thing that I think is part of it is look at the timing of it. It came out today.
[12:28.160 --> 12:32.960]  It looks like, you know, it's pretty, I don't know how many, how long it is, but it sounds
[12:32.960 --> 12:40.240]  to me like he got this access to, to, to lynch and die sometime after the event last month,
[12:40.240 --> 12:45.840]  but probably a couple weeks ago. Yeah, it, it wasn't, it wasn't yesterday.
[12:45.840 --> 12:51.920]  Or at least a week ago, I mean, I think it would be at least a week, maybe more,
[12:51.920 --> 12:56.320]  but some, you know, but anyway, I, and who knows, maybe he did, but it certainly doesn't
[12:56.320 --> 13:01.840]  sound and, and, and Pierce never says, here's the thing, Pierce never says in here that he's had
[13:01.840 --> 13:07.040]  the watch that he himself is, you know, got access to one and it doesn't read like a review in
[13:07.040 --> 13:14.720]  any way. Um, so I'm guessing he didn't. I mean, I'm sure that they had, you know, you know, that he
[13:14.720 --> 13:20.000]  got to see demos from the watches that lynch and die and others were wearing and that they had
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.080]  demo units similar to the ones that were at the event, et cetera, but he didn't get he,
[13:24.080 --> 13:27.920]  he doesn't have first time experience of what it's like to use the watch. So how do you write
[13:27.920 --> 13:31.360]  this story? Like, so on the one hand, I think I could have done this better, but on the other hand,
[13:31.360 --> 13:34.880]  even if they had offered it to me, I don't see how I could have accepted it unless they
[13:34.880 --> 13:41.520]  get, let me use the watch for a week first, so that I'd have a frame of reference. Like,
[13:41.520 --> 13:47.040]  how do you, how do you talk to the two people and, and, you know, the two, maybe they're the only
[13:47.040 --> 13:53.040]  two sources, you know, it's on the record, but die is the user interface point person for the watch,
[13:54.080 --> 13:58.080]  or they say for all of Apple's human interface group, but led the, you know, the team that
[13:58.080 --> 14:05.520]  did the watch interface and lynch was in charge of the software team that implemented the designs.
[14:05.520 --> 14:14.320]  So how, I don't understand how you have the best possible interview with those two unless you are
[14:14.320 --> 14:20.720]  familiar with the product that they're talking about. So I just, you know, I understand my Apple
[14:20.720 --> 14:26.480]  might want an article coming out before, you know, the pre-orders to keep the hype level up,
[14:26.480 --> 14:30.960]  but it's, to me, a waste of time. So on the one hand, I wish that they'd pick me to write it or
[14:30.960 --> 14:34.080]  ask me to write it, but on the other hand, there's no way I would have accepted it unless I had
[14:34.080 --> 14:36.880]  firsthand experience with the watch, because I'd feel like I'm going in blind.
[14:37.920 --> 14:41.360]  Yeah, well, that's why, and you're right, I'm just saying a pure disaster is a little, a little
[14:41.360 --> 14:46.400]  strong, but it's because who knows how much it's going to break through, but the, the, this is why
[14:46.400 --> 14:55.200]  I, I place, that's one of the many reasons why I place. I think this article reflects poorly on Apple's
[14:55.200 --> 15:00.960]  Apple's communications team. And the reason is a few things. One, the reasons you just articulated,
[15:00.960 --> 15:05.440]  right? Like if, if it isn't like one, maybe they picked the wrong guy, I don't know, I don't know,
[15:05.440 --> 15:10.560]  I don't know David Pierce, he has a great reputation. So, you know, I, you know, you're right,
[15:10.560 --> 15:15.040]  he was put in a difficult position by having to write about something that he, you're right,
[15:15.040 --> 15:25.280]  I agree. It seems like he hasn't used to, uh, to like, there's, there's a, there's a certain
[15:25.280 --> 15:34.000]  art to messaging something and, and origin stories and things like that. And, and it might be
[15:34.880 --> 15:41.520]  true that Apple decided to watch and then figured out, but I would also bet that Apple decided
[15:41.520 --> 15:46.720]  to do a phone and then figured out what it would do as well. Like, there's like the thing,
[15:46.720 --> 15:52.240]  what the thing about this thing that everyone's latching onto is, if you actually think about it,
[15:52.240 --> 15:58.560]  it's not really that controversial. Like, um, that, that that's how that's how products like this,
[15:58.560 --> 16:04.720]  like products like this are developed. Um, you, but you, that's not how you necessarily tell the
[16:04.720 --> 16:09.200]  story. The way you told the phone story was, we all hated our phones. So we wanted to do something
[16:09.200 --> 16:13.600]  better, right? And that, that was the line. And everyone remembers that. Everyone remembers,
[16:13.600 --> 16:22.640]  you know, Steve Jobs saying that at the keynote. And that, that line, um, like, that's,
[16:22.640 --> 16:29.520]  there's no line like that about, about the watch. And now the line that is, that is, especially
[16:29.520 --> 16:35.200]  with this article, um, gonna kind of become cemented, particularly when the tech press is that
[16:35.200 --> 16:40.000]  Apple wanted to make watch. Yeah, I think I am, I am in complete agreement with you. I don't think
[16:40.000 --> 16:45.120]  it's damning. And I don't think it's, um, I don't know whatever the app is, what's the opposite
[16:45.120 --> 16:48.880]  of damning. I don't think it's anything. It's nothing. Because I think, I think you're right,
[16:48.880 --> 16:52.880]  all products start like that. Like, okay, let's try to make a phone and see if it comes out.
[16:52.880 --> 16:57.520]  Or really like the way Apple did it was, let's try to make a phone and they made two phones,
[16:57.520 --> 17:05.760]  right? There was the Fidel team working on the, uh, iPod OS version of the phone. And there was the
[17:06.480 --> 17:14.640]  four stall, um, uh, Bertrand. So let side trying to do the, we can seriously, we can strip down
[17:14.640 --> 17:20.880]  OS 10 to something that'll run on this trust us side. And then it was like, okay, this is the one.
[17:21.600 --> 17:26.400]  Well, the, the views with the phone is the phone had a reason to exist. And that was that it was a
[17:26.400 --> 17:33.040]  phone. Uh, and the, what's funny about the line that we're talking about is like everyone
[17:33.440 --> 17:37.920]  pretends like, I don't know why it's in parentheses. You're right. Like the watch does have
[17:37.920 --> 17:44.400]  reason to exist. It's a watch. Right. Like it tells, it tells the time. And, uh, now admittedly,
[17:44.400 --> 17:50.320]  this is a, this is less compelling because everyone needs a phone, but clearly over the last
[17:50.320 --> 17:56.560]  several years more and more people have decided they don't need watches. So I appreciate that, uh,
[17:56.560 --> 18:05.360]  there's more of a need to, to, uh, you know, to create value outside of that to get people who
[18:05.360 --> 18:10.880]  never want to watch to start wearing it, start wearing one. That said, it's not like they're like,
[18:10.880 --> 18:19.760]  this is Google Glass, for example, um, where there was no, there was no pre-existing kind of
[18:19.760 --> 18:24.480]  thing for it to fit into. Like there's no framing for it to fit into. It was a, it was a completely
[18:24.480 --> 18:31.280]  new to the world thing, um, whereas the phone was a phone, but more. And this is a watch, but more.
[18:31.280 --> 18:35.840]  And I think this is why Apple, and this is, this is almost where Apple kind of got it, but not quite.
[18:35.840 --> 18:40.000]  That's why like Tim Cook, the first things that about the phone, it keeps super accurate time,
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.960]  which was kind of weird. But I think that was the idea was establishing that this is a watch
[18:44.960 --> 18:48.400]  first and foremost. And that's why it's called Apple Watch. It's not called a smartwatch. You know,
[18:48.400 --> 18:53.600]  and all, all that sort of stuff. And, um, and I think you, you see that in here, because there,
[18:53.600 --> 18:58.560]  there, there is like all the imaging about, a lot of the imaging about like the watch faces,
[18:58.560 --> 19:02.800]  and there's the thing about the Mickey Mouse thing in here and the, and the sore thing. And like,
[19:02.800 --> 19:11.360]  so I think Apple was going for that, but there's just a, there's a lack of clarity, I think,
[19:11.360 --> 19:18.880]  in, in their messaging. And, and frankly, I mean, I think Apple, the company is doing very well,
[19:18.880 --> 19:24.160]  but I think this is an era they've struggled with, you know, kind of consistently, since, since Steve
[19:24.160 --> 19:27.520]  Jobs, you know, kind of passed away. And this was, if you think about this is the one area that
[19:27.520 --> 19:33.360]  he really did micromanage, but he, he looked over everything and approved everything when it came
[19:33.360 --> 19:38.160]  to messaging. And the fear about micromanaging is what happens when the micromanager goes away,
[19:38.160 --> 19:43.520]  do the people that are left have the, the skills and ability to come up with stuff in their own,
[19:43.520 --> 19:48.560]  or are they just people who implement it? And, um, I haven't seen super compelling evidence,
[19:48.560 --> 19:51.280]  quite frankly, in the last several years, I've written them up the several times,
[19:51.280 --> 19:56.400]  that Apple really has their, their messaging muscle fully developed.
[19:56.400 --> 20:01.120]  Hold that thought, because I, I want to come back to that exact point. Hold that.
[20:02.640 --> 20:05.440]  I want to go back. What? It's in my hands.
[20:05.440 --> 20:08.160]  In your hands. Okay, because I'm really bad at holding a thought.
[20:12.880 --> 20:19.600]  Because that's another meta point that I want to make, but to go back to my admitted
[20:20.480 --> 20:25.520]  pettiness, complaining about the article and professional jealousy, I'm also, I don't do that
[20:25.520 --> 20:29.840]  all the time. I certainly like the, the Ian Parker profile of Johnny I've in the New Yorker
[20:30.400 --> 20:33.600]  from a few, I guess it's a few months ago now. Yeah, February 23rd,
[20:33.600 --> 20:41.600]  uh, was fantastic, absolutely tremendous piece for the ages. I, I don't even know that I haven't
[20:41.600 --> 20:45.440]  a niggle about it. I guess my only niggle was that when he quoted me that he didn't quote the,
[20:45.440 --> 20:52.640]  the better part of the, uh, the line. Uh, so I will, we'll get to your quote soon in this article.
[20:52.640 --> 20:57.920]  Um, I'm not, yeah, exactly. I'm not above, you know, I, I don't, every single time somebody gets,
[20:57.920 --> 21:01.840]  you know, access to Apple, I'm not, I don't think, wow, that should have been me. This Ian
[21:01.840 --> 21:08.640]  Parker story for the New Yorker, fantastic. Also, I've been, uh, endless in my praise for, um,
[21:09.360 --> 21:13.760]  the new becoming Steve Jobs book, which I think is fantastic and I recommend to everybody,
[21:14.320 --> 21:19.040]  uh, and I think it's, I'm not going to say it's perfect, but I think it is excellent, truly
[21:19.040 --> 21:23.360]  excellent and a great compliment to everything that's all, especially as a compliment to all the
[21:23.360 --> 21:27.760]  other books that have been written about jobs and Apple in, you know, last few decades.
[21:27.760 --> 21:33.280]  Um, so it's not like I always complain about people who write about Apple, you know, it's not like
[21:33.280 --> 21:38.480]  I'm constantly saying I could have done that better. I could have done that better. Um, but I just think
[21:38.480 --> 21:45.360]  in this case a lot of people could have done this better. Um, yeah, but I mean, at the end of the day,
[21:45.360 --> 21:53.520]  like, uh, I mean, I think the, the fault for the Isaacson book falls on jobs. Yeah, I do too.
[21:53.520 --> 21:58.000]  Well, both. I say both. Well, I mean, yes, it does, but at the, but like, you know,
[21:59.920 --> 22:05.600]  one, one can suspect that, you know, why didn't jobs pick someone that knew him well in new
[22:05.600 --> 22:09.600]  Apple well, new technology well. Well, and there's a great, there's a great story in becoming
[22:09.600 --> 22:15.600]  Steve Jobs that Bruce Slender tells of when he was at the Wall Street Journal, one, and this was
[22:15.600 --> 22:21.680]  like in a, this was before he, I think it was before he met jobs the first time and why he was
[22:21.680 --> 22:26.720]  nervous meeting him the first time in the 80s. Um, was that he had a colleague at the Wall
[22:26.720 --> 22:31.200]  Street Journal who got an interview with Jobs. I think while he was still at Apple and he was like,
[22:31.200 --> 22:35.440]  Jobs just interrupted the interview and said something to the effect of, do you understand
[22:35.440 --> 22:39.040]  anything at all about this fucking stuff that we're talking about? Do you understand any of this?
[22:40.240 --> 22:45.520]  Just called him out on it, you know, and I probably didn't. And I kind of feel like if, you know,
[22:45.520 --> 22:51.280]  I think Jobs was probably a really good, uh, judge of whether people understood the stuff
[22:51.280 --> 22:56.240]  that they were talking about, I think it was really hard to bullshit that man. Uh, I think he had
[22:56.240 --> 22:59.840]  to know that Isaacson just didn't know what the fuck he was talking about with his work,
[23:00.640 --> 23:02.720]  which I, you know, I agree the buck stops with Jobs.
[23:04.080 --> 23:07.840]  Well, I mean, that's the same thing here. I mean, like, uh, this is like,
[23:08.960 --> 23:14.800]  I don't think, I don't think this article, uh, accomplished what Apple wanted it to accomplish.
[23:14.800 --> 23:19.280]  No. And, um, and I, I think the buck stops, stops with Apple.
[23:19.280 --> 23:24.480]  Yeah. So let's think back. So this idea, hey, let's make a watch and we don't know what it's going
[23:24.480 --> 23:28.400]  to do, but let's just set out to do it. And that, like you said, a lot of people are latching
[23:28.400 --> 23:33.520]  onto this as proof that it's, uh, the whole thing was doomed and folly. That's, I think that's
[23:33.520 --> 23:38.240]  exactly what they do with everything. The key is to go back to that line from a year or two ago
[23:38.240 --> 23:45.920]  that thousand knows for every yes, right? Do well, do a thousand crazy things and the, the, the,
[23:45.920 --> 23:53.040]  the trick isn't in coming up with the brilliant idea from the outset, right? That's, that is,
[23:53.040 --> 23:59.600]  that's death. If you only, if you just sit there and wait at the idea stage until you have a perfect
[23:59.600 --> 24:05.200]  idea and it's all comes together and then go build it. That's death. That's the way you make
[24:05.200 --> 24:11.760]  crap products. You have to get your hands dirty, get the clay and start molding the clay and start
[24:11.760 --> 24:17.760]  making things and try it and look at it and think, is this anything? And then if you think it's
[24:17.760 --> 24:22.080]  something, keep going. And then even after you've spent a lot of time on it, eventually you've got
[24:22.080 --> 24:28.880]  to say, well, it was worth it, but no, we're not going to do this. And then you know, you abandon it.
[24:28.880 --> 24:35.760]  No, there, there, there's Paul, Paul Thorett posted a bunch of like old, old stuff that he had
[24:35.760 --> 24:45.920]  today. And he posted this amazing kind of like, like statue type thing that was like a, a, a, a
[24:45.920 --> 24:51.920]  concept case for Longhorn. And it was like these three CDs in a glass case and it was way overdone
[24:51.920 --> 24:56.000]  and out of there. But I, it's funny that you mentioned that because that was like the classic case
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.240]  of pre, like pre planning. Like Microsoft, oh, we're going to do all this stuff. We're going to
[25:00.240 --> 25:06.000]  redo the file system. We're going to redo like all like, usual database is like all this crazy stuff.
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.640]  And they got so focused on the like, this is the idea. And now we're going to make it happen that
[25:10.640 --> 25:17.760]  they spun themselves into the ground. And, and took, and took years to recover from that. And
[25:17.760 --> 25:22.160]  no, I think you're exactly right. Like you, you, you, you don't start with an idea. You start with a
[25:22.160 --> 25:28.400]  ton of ideas and, and whittled down. So it's a three year project. And the, the idea, you know,
[25:28.400 --> 25:32.640]  the people are latching on to the idea that the, that the mistake was made back on day one when
[25:32.640 --> 25:38.480]  they said, let's make a watch and figure out what, what it could be good for. No, if, if the watch
[25:38.480 --> 25:45.200]  is a bad product, if it's a, if this is, you know, or, or even not, not bad, even if it's just not
[25:45.200 --> 25:52.240]  great. The problem wasn't on day one. The problem was on day, you know, 800, 700 somewhere around
[25:52.240 --> 25:57.600]  there. Maybe even 900 when they didn't just say, you know what, no, this isn't good enough.
[25:57.600 --> 26:03.760]  It's not at the beginning stage is that the note, it's at that end stage. It's having the
[26:03.760 --> 26:07.520]  discipline of, you know, what do they say killing your babies? And even though you've invested
[26:07.520 --> 26:12.160]  two years in this, you may have to backtrack a year. And there is some of that in here. There's
[26:12.160 --> 26:16.080]  some of that in this, in the wired story where they say that they've, you know, had to rebuild
[26:16.080 --> 26:21.600]  some of the software from scratch three times. Yeah, I thought it was interesting that they,
[26:21.600 --> 26:27.280]  they actually had the same interface as the pebble time. Yes. Yes. I, that was one of the,
[26:27.280 --> 26:31.280]  that was one of the things I called out. I actually called that out. Let me see here. Here's the
[26:31.280 --> 26:37.920]  quote. An early version of the software served you information in a timeline flowing chronologically
[26:37.920 --> 26:43.680]  from top to bottom. That idea never made it off campus. The ideas that will ship on April 24,
[26:43.680 --> 26:47.760]  are focused on streamlining the time it takes a user to figure out whether something is worth
[26:47.760 --> 26:52.640]  paying attention to. So yeah, it sounds, which is, and again, that drove me nuts though that
[26:52.640 --> 26:57.440]  Pierce didn't delve more into that into their idea. If they told him about that idea, I would
[26:57.440 --> 27:02.880]  have loved to have heard more about it and see just how much it was like the Pebble 2.0 interface.
[27:03.520 --> 27:08.240]  Because that's, that's the Pebble 2.0 is what, what is up is old and down is,
[27:09.040 --> 27:15.600]  up is old. The middle is now and down is the future. Right. And I, it sounds like the criticism is,
[27:15.600 --> 27:22.320]  and now we're like reading into an article that that was reading into whatever, but was that that
[27:22.320 --> 27:27.520]  leads everything the same level of priority. And, and so now you're just, you're just scrolling
[27:27.520 --> 27:32.880]  through stuff that may be important stuff that may not be. And the, and the insinuation here is,
[27:32.880 --> 27:40.720]  I think that Apple re-did the interface to, to more surface things in the moment and then either
[27:40.720 --> 27:45.520]  have them go away or have them, or, or, or, you know, have it to be more immediate and more,
[27:45.520 --> 27:51.360]  more reaction, you know, reactive. Yeah. Alan Dye is actually an interesting guy. I don't know,
[27:51.360 --> 27:56.800]  you know, personally, but his, he's actually, and he's, I knew of him and he's,
[27:58.160 --> 28:04.320]  even though his name probably isn't that well known, is somewhat controversial. If you consider
[28:04.320 --> 28:11.440]  the whole, you know, you change in UI direction from iOS 7 and Yosemite to be controversial,
[28:11.440 --> 28:17.040]  because he led that work, you know, working directly under I've, and it's the fact that his
[28:17.040 --> 28:25.040]  background is graphic design. Yep. I, I was, I was thinking the exact same thing. And he came into
[28:25.040 --> 28:32.560]  Apple and Shiller's product marketing group and did things like the packaging, you know, like boxes
[28:32.560 --> 28:40.400]  and stuff like that. And then moved to take a leadership role in user interface design. And the,
[28:40.960 --> 28:46.240]  it's, like I said, I would call it controversy. And people inside Apple, I know, you know, there are
[28:46.240 --> 28:51.920]  people who, who strongly disagree with the direction that I think that that is the criticism of,
[28:51.920 --> 28:57.280]  of the iOS 7 aesthetic is that it looks fantastic. But there's a difference between looking good
[28:57.280 --> 29:02.720]  in a screenshot and, and actually being something that you interact with. And, and I think all the
[29:02.720 --> 29:08.720]  criticism is about like the affordances, like how do you know what to do, what to press? And that's
[29:08.720 --> 29:14.640]  something that I do think is lacking and it is still lacking. And even though no question,
[29:14.640 --> 29:20.720]  iOS 7, I would say look a million times better than, than the previous version, it is harder to use.
[29:23.520 --> 29:30.720]  Yeah. And, you know, it's inside the company, like HR wise, there's been turnover, like where there are,
[29:33.600 --> 29:38.880]  and again, I don't think it's complete. It's not like all of the old human interface team
[29:38.880 --> 29:45.520]  was, let go, forced out, and they're all, you know, have new jobs elsewhere. And a whole new team
[29:45.520 --> 29:52.160]  came in. But in some ways, it's, you know, you know, some of the old people are still there. And,
[29:52.160 --> 29:56.080]  you know, it wasn't a complete reshuffling, but it was definitely,
[29:59.200 --> 30:04.480]  somewhat of a reshuffling, right? Yep. Now I've heard the same thing, you know, that, and there's definitely
[30:04.480 --> 30:10.160]  some, you know, user interface people from the other side, the old school people who have left
[30:10.160 --> 30:17.120]  Apple and, you know, Google and other places now in, in the valley, and DIE is sort of,
[30:18.000 --> 30:21.120]  I forget the other name. I know there's another person who came from product marketing,
[30:23.600 --> 30:26.960]  you know, and there's some resentment from the people who don't think, who don't agree with the
[30:26.960 --> 30:35.680]  direction, just as an aside. Let me take a break and then we'll come back to that point that I
[30:35.680 --> 30:40.240]  told you to keep in your hands. Is that all right? It was slipping through my fingers, but
[30:40.240 --> 30:44.240]  let me remind her I just re-grabbed it. All right, hold on. Let's take a break and let's thank
[30:45.600 --> 30:51.520]  our first sponsor. It's our good friends at Fracture. You guys know Fracture. I talk about them.
[30:51.520 --> 31:00.400]  They've been sponsoring the show all year long. Rate, great service. They print photographs directly
[31:00.400 --> 31:06.080]  on glass. You take pictures with your iPhone, any camera you want. You've got them. They're all
[31:06.080 --> 31:12.400]  on your computer, right? In the old days, all your pictures ran a lot, and it was easy. You could
[31:12.400 --> 31:18.720]  just buy a frame, you put the best ones up. We've got everything digital now. It's great to print
[31:18.720 --> 31:23.200]  your photos. It really is your best photos. You put them up. You get some pictures of your kids,
[31:23.200 --> 31:28.800]  or your family, and stuff like that. You put them up on the wall. And then all of a sudden,
[31:28.800 --> 31:32.240]  you look at them and my God, everybody's older, right? We've got a picture. I just saw it the
[31:32.240 --> 31:39.760]  other day. It was from my wife's and my wedding. And God, it was a long time ago. One of her
[31:39.760 --> 31:44.640]  cousins was just a tiny little girl, like preschool aged, and now she's like a senior in high school.
[31:44.640 --> 31:50.400]  And it's like, holy shit, look at her. What a great reminder. Printing photos. I can't recommend
[31:50.400 --> 31:56.480]  it enough. While fracture is a great way to do it, you send them your photos. They print them
[31:56.480 --> 32:01.760]  directly on glass. Not a piece of paper stuck to glass. I don't even know how they do it. Some kind
[32:01.760 --> 32:08.320]  of proprietary secret sauce. They print them right on the glass. Just like the way that our iPhones
[32:08.320 --> 32:14.400]  are laminated, the pixels are laminated to the glass. It's a fantastic effect. It really looks great.
[32:15.840 --> 32:22.320]  And it lets you mount them in these amazingly minimal ways, because there's no reason you don't
[32:22.320 --> 32:26.000]  need to have a border around the frame, because there's no piece of paper that's secured to the glass.
[32:27.360 --> 32:32.320]  So you can get these amazing edge-to-edge, just the glass, just the picture, just the picture,
[32:32.320 --> 32:40.160]  just sitting there. Really, really amazing stuff. Great prices, all sorts of sizes from really small
[32:40.160 --> 32:47.120]  stuff you can put on your desk to really big, twice 23 by 23 square. I forget how big the big
[32:47.120 --> 32:53.920]  rectangle one is. Something 28 inches, 27 inches. Really, really big. And the amazing thing about that,
[32:53.920 --> 32:59.760]  too, is it ties into, I think, Apple's campaign with the iPhone 6 camera, the shot with iPhone,
[32:59.760 --> 33:07.920]  with just how good iPhone pictures look, blown up big. We know that the iPhone has a good
[33:07.920 --> 33:11.600]  camera, but it's like, you still think, well, it's a phone camera, so you can't blow it up real big.
[33:11.600 --> 33:16.000]  It's like, actually, you can. There's plenty of pixels. You can go to 20 some inches with photos
[33:16.000 --> 33:19.840]  taken with your iPhone, and they look amazing. I mean, some of the ones in the Apple store,
[33:19.840 --> 33:25.440]  they've got blown up to like six feet, and they look great. So where do you go to find out more?
[33:25.440 --> 33:36.560]  Go to fractureme.com, and you can sign up. Is there a code? I think there's a code, but I forget it.
[33:39.360 --> 33:41.040]  Well, I'll tell you later about the code.
[33:44.720 --> 33:51.200]  Go there. Go to fractureme.com and get some pictures printed, and my thanks to fracture.
[33:51.200 --> 33:56.400]  All right. Where was the thought that I had told you to hold your hand?
[33:57.920 --> 34:10.400]  So the idea is that Apple's messaging hasn't been as crisp as it once was, and I always hate to
[34:10.400 --> 34:18.160]  dip into the, since Steve Jobs, sort of narrative. But I think this is the one area where Apple
[34:18.160 --> 34:24.560]  does miss him, and I think the reason they miss him is in part because he was so deeply
[34:25.360 --> 34:34.960]  involved in the messaging, approving everything. You cannot overstate how involved he was, more than
[34:34.960 --> 34:42.160]  product design. And the problem with that is the danger of having a micromanager is,
[34:42.160 --> 34:46.880]  well, the micromanager is there, presuming he's brilliant as Jobs obviously was, particularly when
[34:46.880 --> 34:52.800]  it came to messaging. You'll get great work, but once the micromanager is gone, everyone underneath
[34:53.520 --> 34:58.480]  the micromanager has just been in pure execution rules. I just got, I just got a message from
[34:58.480 --> 35:03.840]  headquarters. Headquarters says the code for fracture. It's a daring fireball. All one word. And when
[35:03.840 --> 35:08.480]  you use that, you save 15%. So let's screw it. Let's not fix it in anything. Let's let it go. This
[35:08.480 --> 35:13.040]  will stick in your head because it came mid conversation. Daring fireball. Use that code when you buy
[35:13.040 --> 35:19.200]  your fracture and you save 15% their prices are already really good. Yes. And here's the big
[35:19.200 --> 35:23.520]  difference. It's another meta angle on this story is in the jobs area. It wasn't just that he
[35:23.520 --> 35:34.160]  controlled the messaging from behind the scenes. It was a strategy of truly severe limited access to
[35:34.160 --> 35:40.880]  any and all Apple employees, including Jobs himself. Yep. And that's one of the things that really
[35:40.880 --> 35:50.400]  sticks out to me reading becoming Steve Jobs was just how much more accessible he was personally
[35:51.840 --> 36:03.040]  right up through coming back to Apple in 1997 that it really was a and even maybe even in those
[36:03.040 --> 36:08.320]  first two years, you know, the first few years there at Apple, he was still a lot more accessible
[36:08.320 --> 36:15.680]  to again, not any and all, not any, you know, Joe or Jane Charlie reporter from anybody. But
[36:15.680 --> 36:20.800]  with handpicked reporters from, you know, big name publications like the Wall Street Journal and
[36:20.800 --> 36:27.120]  Fortune and et cetera, he was pretty accessible. And then that that got shut down, really. And
[36:27.120 --> 36:35.200]  nobody, nobody got to talk to Apple executives. And you certainly didn't see this. It is clearly a
[36:35.200 --> 36:40.960]  huge strategic change at Apple in terms of just how many people they've made accessible to the
[36:40.960 --> 36:47.600]  press in the run up to the watch. Huge profile of Johnny I've in the New Yorker, which was clearly
[36:47.600 --> 36:54.640]  months into making, I mean, maybe the better part of 2014, you know, with the series of interviews
[36:54.640 --> 37:03.360]  and trips to California, enormous access that was granted to Ian Parker. And the financial times
[37:03.360 --> 37:08.400]  had a, you know, clearly not as detailed in his lengthy as Ian Parker, but pretty, pretty good
[37:08.400 --> 37:15.440]  interview with Johnny I've on the record. There was a Tim Cook profile by Adam Licinski in
[37:17.440 --> 37:25.120]  Oh, boy, fortune. Oh, no. I watch in our forms. I, because they, I swear to God,
[37:25.120 --> 37:28.880]  by the way, my brain works, it's like a hashing algorithm. And because they both start with
[37:28.880 --> 37:35.600]  F O R and their business publications, I always confuse fortune is fortune is fortune. That was
[37:35.600 --> 37:42.880]  last week. And I'm, I think I'm forgetting some. Well, and then after the event last year, there
[37:42.880 --> 37:47.200]  was a bunch too, like he was in the Bloomberg business week with that, you know, crazy cover.
[37:47.200 --> 37:52.480]  Yeah. But yeah, it's interesting. I've actually, I've actually going back, it's not perfect,
[37:52.480 --> 37:58.800]  but I'm doing, I'm searching in Google for the time period up to the, the actual launch of the watch
[37:58.800 --> 38:04.640]  or of the phone, sorry, back in 2007. And you would think that any sort of article like this sort
[38:04.640 --> 38:08.080]  of wire article would be somewhere at the top. And I don't, I can't find anything like it.
[38:08.080 --> 38:12.560]  Like the only I can find are the reviews that dropped, you know, a week before.
[38:12.560 --> 38:17.680]  I don't recall. And I, I think I would have, I don't recall every hearing about like who
[38:17.680 --> 38:25.120]  designed at the interface for the iPhone. And I don't recall, I mean, we knew Johnny I've and,
[38:25.120 --> 38:32.960]  you know, in the, in the jobs era, the best that you got outside Apple was just public recognition
[38:32.960 --> 38:37.920]  of who did what? Yep. And Johnny, I would like to give a speech like once a year, like usually
[38:37.920 --> 38:42.080]  somewhere in Great Britain and like that, that, that was, that was about it. And he was already
[38:42.080 --> 38:48.960]  talking in the, the videos, you know, I think I think I've, I've was already, you know,
[38:48.960 --> 38:53.200]  either being interviewed. It wasn't really like now he narrates them, but then it was like he was
[38:53.200 --> 38:57.200]  the, you know, the talking head with the white background, you know, talking about what, you know,
[38:57.200 --> 39:03.760]  the, you know, meticulous design and, you know, dropping all those excellently impeccably pronounced
[39:03.760 --> 39:08.400]  adjectives. You know, we always know who Shiller is because Shiller is on stage.
[39:08.400 --> 39:14.960]  Um, but you just never got behind this, you know, there's never any kind of access like this,
[39:14.960 --> 39:19.840]  like talking them to people who designed, you know, the look and feel of the buttons for iOS
[39:19.840 --> 39:25.920]  one and stuff like that. Right. It's all you got was the story that jobs presented on stage.
[39:27.040 --> 39:32.400]  Right. Yeah. So I think there's a couple things here. So one, um, it was super tightly controlled,
[39:32.400 --> 39:39.760]  which meant means like, uh, you're not getting a story like this that I think that I suspect it,
[39:39.760 --> 39:46.400]  it came out with a spin that Apple probably probably wouldn't, probably wouldn't prefer.
[39:47.120 --> 39:52.880]  Um, so that's kind of part one, like it is, you know, this is kind of the risk of being open.
[39:52.880 --> 39:59.520]  But part two is even the people who are talking don't, don't have a crispness in, in, in,
[39:59.520 --> 40:05.600]  in what they're saying. And, and I know like, and again, the narrative for skeptics in particular
[40:05.600 --> 40:10.720]  is that, you know, why, why does it exist? Um, again, like I actually think this is the, what's
[40:10.720 --> 40:15.600]  hard about messaging. I actually think what they're saying in this article is exactly right. Like
[40:15.600 --> 40:23.840]  you, I, I don't believe that advancement and technology and computing happens because like
[40:23.840 --> 40:29.520]  great people force it into being like, I think that there's, there's kind of, uh, in, in doubt,
[40:29.520 --> 40:35.760]  like an ongoing march forward progress of technology and the great companies and the great
[40:35.760 --> 40:42.320]  visionaries like a Steve Jobs, their skill is not in like, birthing things per se. It's,
[40:42.320 --> 40:48.160]  it's in seeing where the, where the wave is going and catching it and being on the cutting edge of
[40:48.160 --> 40:53.360]  it. And, and that's why you see again and again, like there's all these examples of history of like
[40:53.360 --> 40:57.680]  stuff being invented by multiple people at about the same time, right? It's because like it's,
[40:57.680 --> 41:02.160]  it's the time for something. And I, and this is my philosophy with technology, my very first
[41:02.160 --> 41:08.000]  post is trajectory, like stated this. And I think it's the time and they, and exactly what he
[41:08.000 --> 41:13.920]  said, the next place is the watch. The problem is that the press, that's not how the press
[41:13.920 --> 41:19.280]  writes stories. The press doesn't write about like the big picture contextual place and technology
[41:19.280 --> 41:22.800]  for this advice. Like that's why I have a job because that's what I write about. But I write to
[41:22.800 --> 41:28.400]  a limited, you know, niche audience. The, what press wants, they want the hero and they want the,
[41:28.400 --> 41:33.200]  the, the, the, the open and shut story in case. And that's why you had Steve Jobs with the iPhone
[41:33.200 --> 41:37.680]  being like, we all hated our phone. So we made a better one. Like if that's, that you can latch
[41:37.680 --> 41:42.480]  onto that. And that's not here. And it's, it's, it has, it's consistently has it been here.
[41:43.040 --> 41:46.560]  You think you first out with the iPad? What like, I know you're seeing it now.
[41:46.560 --> 41:53.200]  I think one of the most interesting things that's come out of this barrage of behind this,
[41:53.200 --> 41:57.760]  you know, accessing quotes from Apple's leaders design leaders. I thought one of the most
[41:57.760 --> 42:03.280]  interesting was that I've quote in the financial times article, which overall wasn't a great
[42:03.280 --> 42:07.760]  article. It wasn't really, you know, but this line was great, which isn't surprising. But more,
[42:07.760 --> 42:12.800]  you know, I've said exactly what you're saying. But it was great to hear from, we approach the phone
[42:12.800 --> 42:19.600]  with from this perspective that we all hated the phones that we had, hated them. And we're
[42:19.600 --> 42:26.160]  approaching the watch as that we love watches. We love the traditional world of mechanical watches.
[42:26.160 --> 42:31.200]  And we're, we're approaching the watch with reverence for what's come before us. And that is a
[42:31.200 --> 42:36.320]  totally different approach. And it's informed everything we did. And it's fascinating to hear that,
[42:36.320 --> 42:42.960]  right? Nothing. No kind of trash talk at all about the traditional world of watches. Yeah.
[42:44.480 --> 42:48.640]  It is interesting. But then this article doesn't go into that at all. It just says, you know,
[42:48.640 --> 42:52.960]  Johnny I've took a deep dive into horology. And I think that was even a mistake. Because from what
[42:52.960 --> 42:59.360]  I understand, it wasn't just that Johnny I went and had like a, I'm going to go become a huge
[42:59.360 --> 43:04.880]  watch expert. Everybody who worked on the watch, like they brought in horological experts and
[43:04.880 --> 43:10.400]  it wasn't just Johnny I've who's studied up on it. It was everybody who was involved. Like the whole
[43:10.400 --> 43:18.560]  team more or less became world-class experts in, in the history and, you know, everything you'd
[43:18.560 --> 43:25.680]  want to know to be a serious, you know, watch expert. Yeah. And I don't think that comes across
[43:25.680 --> 43:31.520]  in the story. I do think, I do think in terms of it being outside Apple's control, I can't
[43:31.520 --> 43:37.680]  help but think that Katie Cotton is, you know, wherever she is this morning is like enjoying
[43:37.680 --> 43:42.160]  her morning cup of tea or coffee or whatever she drinks. And it's just shaking her head.
[43:43.040 --> 43:47.520]  I was under the impression she started out with Scotch first thing, but I don't think so.
[43:50.080 --> 43:56.720]  No. Yeah. No. I think I agree. And like there. And yeah, people got people,
[43:56.720 --> 44:05.840]  people obviously, especially journalists, you know, very much just like that era of Apple from a
[44:05.840 --> 44:14.080]  PR perspective and dislike Katie Cotton by large. Right. But the fact of the matter is Apple didn't
[44:14.080 --> 44:18.720]  Apple's message always got across. Apple wasn't out to me. Because there was nothing else to
[44:18.720 --> 44:24.400]  write about. Like the only thing they let out was exactly what they wanted to let out. And again,
[44:24.400 --> 44:28.640]  like like I said, like, it's almost like the problem here and the problem with this article
[44:28.640 --> 44:35.520]  and all these articles is they're too honest. And and I appreciate that and you appreciate that.
[44:36.480 --> 44:42.400]  But honest kind of unfiltered honesty, and this is this is kind of maybe we can lead into your
[44:42.400 --> 44:50.080]  buzzery mark here. Like unfiltered honesty, without doesn't, it doesn't, it's not a soundbite.
[44:50.080 --> 44:58.400]  Like, and it doesn't, it doesn't spread. Um, in, in or it leads itself open to all kinds of
[44:58.400 --> 45:04.880]  interpretations. Yeah. And, uh, that's you kind of see that happening in the, in the hands of someone
[45:04.880 --> 45:11.920]  like like in Parker, who, who, who remember it took 17,000 words to do it. Like what was it about
[45:11.920 --> 45:16.080]  the link that matter to it was all the context that was put around it, right? When you put
[45:16.080 --> 45:22.720]  context around honesty, then it's so fulfilling. And it's like you, you read that article,
[45:22.720 --> 45:28.960]  like eating a steak dinner or something, right? But when you, when you have honesty, but without
[45:29.760 --> 45:36.400]  deep understanding or context, it, it leads itself open to interpretation, which I think happened
[45:36.400 --> 45:42.720]  here. And so you had pierces interpretation on top of it. Um, and to you get kind of unintended
[45:42.720 --> 45:46.720]  sound bites. And I think that's exactly what happened to the sound bite is Apple didn't have
[45:46.720 --> 45:52.000]  a plan for the watch. Um, when again, I think you look at big picture, a watch is the natural
[45:52.000 --> 45:56.240]  thing to do next. And hey, it does tell time. And I honestly think that that's the better way
[45:56.240 --> 46:01.440]  to approach it is, okay, let's approach it with an empty mind and anything and everything goes
[46:01.440 --> 46:05.600]  as opposed to, I'm telling you, the worst way to design anything is to have the whole thing in
[46:05.600 --> 46:12.160]  your head and then go make the thing in your head without constant iteration and revisiting and
[46:12.160 --> 46:17.120]  feeling it as it becomes realer and realer and realer. It's, it's, to me, one of the secrets
[46:17.120 --> 46:24.560]  of Apple's success in the last, um, geez, what are we even up to now, 20, 20 years, 15 years?
[46:24.560 --> 46:30.000]  What the hell, how long has it been? Well, the, well, the I, the iPod was 18 years. I'm going to
[46:30.000 --> 46:40.000]  say 18 years since 97. Let's fair. Uh, is, is that they don't, you know, it's not like somebody
[46:40.000 --> 46:44.480]  goes off with a notebook, sketches a thing and draws it all up and then somebody goes and makes it
[46:44.480 --> 46:49.600]  which is I think how a lot of technology gets made, has been made ever since the outset of technology.
[46:49.600 --> 46:53.200]  Oh, totally. I mean, I think people, I mean, people have this idea that Apple has this grand
[46:53.200 --> 46:59.600]  vision. I mean, like, one, one thing that I, when I, um, I got a chance to really dig deep into
[46:59.600 --> 47:06.080]  when I, when I was at Apple was, was looking at the, um, how iTunes came about and basically,
[47:06.080 --> 47:09.600]  and what people forget about this, I think I might have told the story, I don't know if you'll do before.
[47:09.600 --> 47:15.680]  Um, but you remember in 2000, Apple had a big event where they're like, you know, the,
[47:15.680 --> 47:20.800]  you know, the, the, what made the Mac the first time around, it was desktop publishing.
[47:20.800 --> 47:26.960]  Well, we think we know it's next and it's going to be movies. And I movie and it was the iMac and
[47:26.960 --> 47:31.840]  it was like, we, we are going to like, you can make home movies and this is what we're going to be
[47:31.840 --> 47:37.440]  all about. Yeah. And then like nine months or nine months later or somewhat absurdly short about a
[47:37.440 --> 47:42.480]  time Steve Johnson's on stage and gives a completely different vision like could not be more
[47:42.480 --> 47:46.880]  different. And that was the digital hub speech. So we think the Mac's going to be a digital hub for
[47:46.880 --> 47:51.120]  all these devices. Yeah. And I think he almost admitted that it was a mistake, right? Because it
[47:51.120 --> 48:00.880]  also coincided with, with making CDR drive standard because part of the problem with the, the prior
[48:00.880 --> 48:07.280]  Macs was that you couldn't make music discs. Right. No. No. I mean, they implicitly admitted
[48:07.280 --> 48:10.800]  it was a problem. I don't, I mean, you see, Charles never want to stand up and say, we, we,
[48:10.800 --> 48:16.240]  we, we screw this up. But I mean, it, it was, yeah, he had a good way of doing it. He had a
[48:16.240 --> 48:20.960]  good way of doing it without saying, you know, he was, I would say one of his greatest gifts was
[48:20.960 --> 48:28.160]  his way of backtracking, even publicly, and somehow making it not look like an admission of error.
[48:28.160 --> 48:31.360]  Right. No, exactly. And you hear this, but you hear this, this is what click always
[48:31.360 --> 48:36.080]  praise about jobs is how you change his mind all the time. Like, I mean, to think that Apple has
[48:36.080 --> 48:43.120]  a master plan and just executes it is, is not just to understand Apple, but it's to misunderstand
[48:43.120 --> 48:48.320]  how progress happens. Yeah. I mean, again, this is back to my kind of big metathesis. Like,
[48:48.320 --> 48:54.160]  you figure out what's next. You don't make what's next. Yeah. And I'm sorry, go ahead.
[48:54.160 --> 48:57.840]  Meanwhile, and you have to look at what people are doing. And, and that era you're talking about,
[48:57.840 --> 49:04.640]  it, it, it was a, it was a dividing point between Mac and PC users, not just in terms of any kind
[49:04.640 --> 49:10.560]  of political affiliation or tribal affiliation, whatever you want to call it, but just in terms of
[49:10.560 --> 49:16.080]  what real people were really doing. And on the PC side, what people were doing was downloading a
[49:16.080 --> 49:23.360]  lot of music from Napster and, and then burning CDs, you know, 10, 11, 12, 13 songs, whatever you could
[49:23.360 --> 49:28.320]  fit. Or I guess you could fit more, I guess you could, with MP3s, you could, if you had an MP3
[49:28.320 --> 49:31.920]  player that could read them off CD. But anyway, people were burning CDs with music, whether it was
[49:31.920 --> 49:39.520]  to play them as regular CDs or to play them in MP3 players that could read MP3s off CDs, people
[49:39.520 --> 49:44.960]  were doing it. And Mac users weren't because they didn't have CDR drives. Yeah. My favorite,
[49:44.960 --> 49:50.480]  actually, one of my favorite jobs quotes comes around this time. I, it's, it's actually really hard
[49:50.480 --> 49:53.840]  to find, I think it's, you have to, you know, and archive off, I'll, I'll try to find it, you know,
[49:53.840 --> 49:59.920]  in a bit. But basically he says, like, I thought we missed it. Like, I thought I screwed up. Like,
[49:59.920 --> 50:05.280]  it was like the most like stark admission of like jobs thing, like admitting that he thought that
[50:05.280 --> 50:08.880]  he totally blew it. He's, they thought they were too late. They thought they were too late to
[50:08.880 --> 50:14.160]  music. They made the wrong focus. They made the wrong bet by focusing on movies. And, and what
[50:14.160 --> 50:19.360]  was amazing is, I mean, the company internally in that, in that year or nine, much of a lot was
[50:19.360 --> 50:23.920]  completely transformed. Like the I movie guys are like top of the heap, right? Within like a matter
[50:23.920 --> 50:29.360]  of like weeks, like completely reorganize, completely deprioritized. Like iTunes was going to be,
[50:29.360 --> 50:34.880]  they went out and bought sound jam. Um, and, and turned around. And, and you think about,
[50:34.880 --> 50:38.480]  and Apple has this reputation. Oh, they do stuff for years and stuff like that. And I, I do believe
[50:38.480 --> 50:45.280]  they, they do that today. But they delivered iTunes and these new Macs in something like nine months.
[50:45.280 --> 50:52.080]  And then they hadn't even conceived of the, really the iPod yet. Uh, a month later was when
[50:52.080 --> 50:56.880]  Rubenstein went to Japan and visit to Sheba. He was like, Oh, we have this little hard drive. We
[50:56.880 --> 51:00.080]  don't know what to do with it. And he's like, Oh, I know we could do with that. And that was in
[51:00.080 --> 51:05.120]  February. And they watched the, they watched the iPod in September. So the iPod was conceived,
[51:05.120 --> 51:14.480]  designed all that in, in six months and in 2001, right in 2001. And, uh, and like that's
[51:14.480 --> 51:21.600]  that's, that's not like starting with the starting with a breakthrough from to Sheba, right?
[51:21.600 --> 51:27.200]  It doesn't crazy story. No, the basic idea there was that standard laptop hard drives were 2.5
[51:27.200 --> 51:33.520]  inches. And to Sheba came up with a 1.8 inch hard drive. And none of the PC makers wanted it
[51:33.520 --> 51:42.240]  because well, well, and, and it, the 2.5 inch size was fine because the, the, the laptops, even
[51:42.240 --> 51:47.200]  the smallest one had to at least the minimum size for the laptop with a keyboard and with a reasonable
[51:47.200 --> 51:53.280]  screen, that inch didn't matter. There was nothing to do with the space saving. The space saving made
[51:53.280 --> 51:58.720]  no difference to the design of laptops and laptops were the only devices. These other companies
[51:58.720 --> 52:04.560]  had that needed smaller drives, right? You had to go to something as radically smaller as like
[52:04.560 --> 52:10.640]  the first iPods to make to say, here's where you need something that here's where 2.5 inches is
[52:10.640 --> 52:17.280]  too, too big. You needed it. And that nobody else had a device in mind that, that needed that.
[52:17.280 --> 52:22.160]  No, it's a wonderful example of how, you know, particularly technology like, and this is why
[52:23.120 --> 52:29.520]  this is, this is why technology companies generally, even though like, you know, you, you want
[52:29.520 --> 52:35.120]  people that have a wide range of experiences and, and liberal arts and sort of stuff like, but
[52:35.120 --> 52:41.520]  that's why the, the technological background is valued because at the end of the day, like, what is
[52:41.520 --> 52:47.120]  possible and what isn't is, is governed by the technology. And, and that's a big part of like,
[52:47.120 --> 52:51.440]  why the iPhone succeeded, whereas something like the Newton didn't like, the technology just wasn't
[52:51.440 --> 52:55.680]  there, whereas the iPhone like the iPhone was on the edge of possible. Like the, the processor was
[52:55.680 --> 52:59.920]  just barely fast enough. They did do all kinds of tricks to, you know, to, to make, to make it
[52:59.920 --> 53:06.400]  responsive like they did. Um, you know, the touchscreen technology was, was just getting cheap enough.
[53:06.400 --> 53:12.160]  And, and that's like, it's, it's understanding that intersection and having the patience
[53:12.160 --> 53:17.280]  to watch something when it's ready. And quite frankly, if you want to, if you want to criticize
[53:17.280 --> 53:21.200]  the watch for anything and, first off, I was just waiting until it actually comes out and you can use
[53:21.200 --> 53:29.360]  it. Um, but to, that never stopped any. But to like, if I think if you look at the arc of
[53:29.360 --> 53:34.160]  personal technology, of course, the next thing's going to be the risk. That's my, that's my opinion,
[53:34.160 --> 53:39.280]  but I think it's pretty clear. The question is, when is the right time? And the right time will
[53:39.280 --> 53:45.360]  be governed by the available technology. Yeah. And, and, and so the criticism of the watch,
[53:45.360 --> 53:50.320]  if it ends up deserving criticism is not that it shouldn't exist. It's that should it exist now
[53:50.320 --> 53:56.800]  or should it exist later. Yeah. And I would say a great example of that is the Newton.
[53:56.800 --> 54:05.520]  And, you know, the Newton was a great product. I really, really appreciated the OS.
[54:05.520 --> 54:10.880]  I, I thought it was a great design. I think you could quibble about some of the details.
[54:10.880 --> 54:15.920]  I think that the way that they made some of the apps blessed, you know, the way that the bottom
[54:15.920 --> 54:19.760]  of the screen, there were certain apps that had a permanent location there and you couldn't
[54:19.760 --> 54:24.640]  change them was questionable. But it was also fixable. They could go forward in a new way.
[54:24.640 --> 54:29.920]  But to me, though, I have talked, I talked about this a long time ago, but to me, the fundamental
[54:31.680 --> 54:37.920]  failure of the Newton was that it came too soon in so far as there was no wireless networking at
[54:37.920 --> 54:44.960]  the time and any device of that basic just form factor needed wireless networking. And I know
[54:44.960 --> 54:51.040]  Palm had some success with Palm pilots in that era. And there wasn't Wi-Fi or cellular networking
[54:51.040 --> 54:55.680]  at the time. But I think if you look at Palm's success with the Palm pilot and how many they sold,
[54:55.680 --> 55:02.720]  it was, it was a hit among us, right? I had one. I had a hands-to-fire background for years
[55:02.720 --> 55:08.880]  and loved it. But there was no way, like, my parents were going to get one or my sister,
[55:08.880 --> 55:13.760]  my sister would never get one. You know, normal people weren't going to get one, right? And it's
[55:13.760 --> 55:17.440]  because it didn't have wireless. And because it didn't have wireless, it couldn't communicate.
[55:17.440 --> 55:22.720]  And you know what people do? They communicate. That's the fundamental gist of why the internet got
[55:22.720 --> 55:28.160]  popular in the 90s was people communicated with each other until people could communicate with
[55:28.160 --> 55:36.160]  each other. They had no interest in PCs, the mass market. It was only for us nerds in the same
[55:36.160 --> 55:42.560]  thing with handhelds. And, you know, that's what doomed the Newton. The Newton needed anything
[55:42.560 --> 55:46.080]  that you carried around to help in your hand. It needs wireless networking because it needs to
[55:46.080 --> 55:53.360]  be a communications device. No, I think that it is the perfect example. And this is, you know,
[55:53.360 --> 56:00.480]  this gets to why Apple has focused on the communication aspect of the watch and, you know,
[56:00.480 --> 56:04.640]  the drawing and the harp, you know, sort of stuff. I mean, we'll obviously, again,
[56:04.640 --> 56:09.360]  we'll have to wait and see how it actually works out in real life. But that's why it's a
[56:09.360 --> 56:21.280]  tentpole feature because that's what matters to normal people. I want to talk about the headline
[56:21.280 --> 56:28.880]  for this article. It drives me crazy. This is the wired article. The headline is,
[56:29.600 --> 56:36.160]  iPhone, killer, colon, the secret history of the Apple Watch. None of that is true.
[56:36.160 --> 56:45.920]  It is not an iPhone killer, right? It's number one. That's the worst. And to me, a bad headline
[56:46.640 --> 56:52.240]  is like a bad first impression. Everything has to recover from that because the first,
[56:52.240 --> 57:03.200]  so the article, the headline sets up such a false impression, right? The watch is useless
[57:03.200 --> 57:07.840]  without your iPhone. Literally. I'm on that literally. I guess there are certain functionality
[57:07.840 --> 57:17.520]  still works outside the range of your phone. But it is fundamentally designed to work as it is a
[57:17.520 --> 57:22.560]  companion. It's supposed to make your life with your phone better. That's the gist of it. It's not
[57:22.560 --> 57:28.640]  a killer. And maybe someday it will be, right? Maybe someday there will be, it certainly seems
[57:28.640 --> 57:33.520]  possible with the march of technology that within a few years, whether that's three years,
[57:33.520 --> 57:39.200]  four years, five years, six years, that the watch will have its own Wi-Fi first, probably. Watch
[57:39.200 --> 57:46.400]  could have its own cellular and be the main device. And then you would buy something like an iPod
[57:46.400 --> 57:51.280]  touch just to be your four-inch, five-inch screen that connects to the watch.
[57:52.800 --> 57:56.320]  It must have Wi-Fi because of the whole it works in your house, even when you're just...
[57:56.320 --> 58:01.840]  Yeah, but it doesn't use, but like you can't set it up. Let's say you never log into your
[58:01.840 --> 58:08.720]  home Wi-Fi. It's that whole Wi-Fi back channel thing. You don't type a password into your watch
[58:08.720 --> 58:13.520]  so that when your phone isn't there, it's on the internet and getting notifications.
[58:13.520 --> 58:18.080]  It's only that back channel. I forget what the technical term for it is, but it's that way that
[58:18.080 --> 58:24.320]  Wi-Fi can now have... If I direct, I think, yeah, something like that. I'm saying that in the future,
[58:24.320 --> 58:29.120]  clearly it's a natural progression that the watch would have its own Wi-Fi. And then you could leave
[58:29.120 --> 58:35.120]  house without your phone. And if it knows the Starbucks network, it can, when you get there,
[58:35.120 --> 58:39.520]  it'll get notifications and email and stuff like that right there. And then you can send text
[58:39.520 --> 58:45.440]  messages or iMessage at least, not SMS, but you could send messages and emails right from your watch
[58:45.440 --> 58:50.640]  without your phone present. That's coming in the future, surely, unless the product is so unpopular
[58:50.640 --> 58:55.600]  that they stop making. Right. Well, I mean, LG just just just watched the watch with LTE.
[58:55.600 --> 58:59.760]  I mean, so it's like, it's in the realm of positive. Yeah, I think Samsung had
[58:59.760 --> 59:04.960]  the Samsung have on the LTE. Yeah, clearly it's possible. It's just a question of when it'll be
[59:04.960 --> 59:12.720]  ready for an Apple caliber product. That headline is not an iPhone killer. Absolutely not. And then
[59:12.720 --> 59:18.400]  the secret history of the Apple watch, boy, that is really overstating the access that he got.
[59:18.400 --> 59:23.280]  Right. I mean, how much this, this is not the secret history of the Apple watch.
[59:23.920 --> 59:28.400]  Right. Like if there's a problem with the article, it said it's so incomplete about the creation
[59:28.400 --> 59:35.280]  story of the Apple watch. There are very few details about what, what paths they went down and
[59:35.280 --> 59:37.920]  backtracked on in the three years that they were working on it.
[59:40.080 --> 59:44.000]  Yeah, no, even the one that was in here, that was kind of interesting about the timeline,
[59:44.000 --> 59:49.520]  wasn't really, wasn't really fleshed out. No, wasn't fleshed out in any, in any degree. So,
[59:49.520 --> 59:55.600]  you know, who hits on the, to me, clickbaity headline from Wired compare that to the, to New Yorker,
[59:55.600 --> 1:00:02.240]  which the headline is the shape of things to come. How an industrial designer became Apple's
[1:00:02.240 --> 1:00:06.480]  greatest product. And then their, their title tag for the article, which is a little different,
[1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:13.200]  is Jonathan, I've in the future of Apple, totally fair, not clickbaity at all. And the article got
[1:00:13.200 --> 1:00:20.560]  tons of attention. It got all the attention it deserves. Well, welcome, welcome, welcome to the
[1:00:20.560 --> 1:00:25.520]  reality of today's worldwide web. Yeah. Let's take a break. And then the last thing we can do on
[1:00:25.520 --> 1:00:32.560]  the article, we just talk about the quote they have for me, which is another, another area where
[1:00:32.560 --> 1:00:38.960]  I'll complain. We'll get to the real area while you're grumpy. Yeah. Let me tell you about a new
[1:00:38.960 --> 1:00:50.320]  sponsor, dash dash is really cool. It's a website that lets you quickly create real time dashboards,
[1:00:50.320 --> 1:00:56.720]  like a, like a status display. You create a dashboard. It's on the web. You can put it anywhere.
[1:00:56.720 --> 1:01:01.760]  You can put a website so you can hook like a, you know, computer up to a big TV set or something
[1:01:01.760 --> 1:01:07.920]  like that. Hang it on your office for your team. And there are dozens of prebuilt widgets for
[1:01:07.920 --> 1:01:14.960]  services like Google analytics, GitHub, Twitter. So you can get stuff from Twitter for your company's
[1:01:14.960 --> 1:01:20.800]  Twitter account, display it on a big dashboard on a TV or something like that for your team to see.
[1:01:20.800 --> 1:01:26.400]  And they also hook up with app figures. App figures is a really cool company that does app
[1:01:26.400 --> 1:01:34.400]  analytics. So you can see things like how many reviews your app got, how many sales you had
[1:01:34.400 --> 1:01:39.120]  yesterday or this week or month to date and stuff like that. So if you just want to put up a
[1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:45.600]  dashboard that graphs things like, you know, your app sales for the last month or last week or whatever,
[1:01:46.960 --> 1:01:50.720]  dash and you use app figures already. Or number one, if you don't use app figures, you should
[1:01:50.720 --> 1:01:54.880]  look into it. But then if you use dash, you can hook up to app figures and get that graphed in a
[1:01:54.880 --> 1:02:03.600]  really, really cool way. And you're not limited to their prebuilt widgets. They have an API. So you
[1:02:03.600 --> 1:02:12.080]  can do custom data. The API, you can use to push real time data or pull it from sources like
[1:02:12.080 --> 1:02:17.520]  Google Drive, Dropbox, or pretty much anywhere on the web. So if you can build something that can put
[1:02:17.520 --> 1:02:24.720]  data into Dropbox, which is pretty easy, it's pretty much just like writing a file, you can then set up
[1:02:24.720 --> 1:02:30.160]  a custom dash widget that'll just log in your Dropbox account and pull the data from there.
[1:02:30.160 --> 1:02:38.640]  The pricing model is fairly simple. Free accounts get unlimited public dashboards so that people can
[1:02:38.640 --> 1:02:46.080]  share live data with the world, with the community. If you upgrade to pro, you can get unlimited
[1:02:46.080 --> 1:02:51.840]  private dashboards and you can get themes and access to the real time push API, the real time push
[1:02:51.840 --> 1:02:58.640]  API is only for pro accounts. 10 bucks a month. That's it. Just 10 bucks a month and you can get a
[1:02:58.640 --> 1:03:03.360]  pro account. Really cool. So the free account, you can use it just to see how cool it is. Use
[1:03:03.360 --> 1:03:09.280]  the free account, see how cool it is. But they're also running a limited time promotion. If you sign
[1:03:09.280 --> 1:03:16.240]  up for a free account today at their website, now their website is the dash dot com the dash dot
[1:03:16.240 --> 1:03:24.800]  com. You'll get one private dashboard in addition to your free accounts unlimited public dashboards.

[1:03:42.640 --> 1:03:50.240]  disappears, you get to keep it. Really cool stuff. So go check them out at the dash dot com.
[1:03:50.240 --> 1:03:58.880]  I thanks Tim. Do you want to read the part of the first paragraph? It was the first paragraph
[1:03:58.880 --> 1:04:06.720]  of David Pierce's story. Sorry about that. I just stepped out for a second. Oh, that's all right.
[1:04:08.400 --> 1:04:13.440]  Oh, I found the quote by the way. Okay. Uh, fortunately, Isaac's in, which, which, the thing
[1:04:13.440 --> 1:04:16.160]  about the essence book is like half of it was just like rewriting other people's stuff.
[1:04:16.160 --> 1:04:23.360]  Um, but, uh, he told Fortune and, and as soon as it in here, uh, I felt like a dope, he told Fortune.
[1:04:23.360 --> 1:04:28.400]  I thought we hadn't missed it. We had to work hard to catch up, um, speaking about music and,
[1:04:28.400 --> 1:04:34.640]  and the fact that they kind of. Rejig, rejig and everything. And the other thing, this is like,
[1:04:34.640 --> 1:04:37.600]  this is, yeah, I know you share my frustration with this. Like the whole
[1:04:38.880 --> 1:04:44.400]  mythology about Apple creating these new products like Apple doesn't create Apple really hasn't
[1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:50.480]  created new products. They've created new user interfaces. Um, but you know, I mean, the, the, the
[1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:57.440]  Mac with the idea of a wimp interface was famously, you know, initially came up at Xerox, this,
[1:04:57.440 --> 1:05:01.680]  you know, the idea of an MP3 player wasn't new. The idea of a smartphone wasn't new. The idea of a tablet
[1:05:01.680 --> 1:05:10.640]  wasn't really new. I mean, and what they do though is they do it really well. And part of doing it
[1:05:10.640 --> 1:05:15.280]  really well is they do it at the right time with the right technology. And it's just like,
[1:05:16.160 --> 1:05:22.160]  it's, again, it goes back to this kind of fundamental, like myth making nature of, of the press.
[1:05:22.160 --> 1:05:26.400]  And I know this is the case in all arenas, case in politics is the case in sports. Everything is
[1:05:26.400 --> 1:05:30.800]  about like, you know, more and more with sports, I'm a huge sports fan. And there's more and more,
[1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:35.440]  uh, writing about kind of like the intricacies of the game and game planning and how
[1:05:36.240 --> 1:05:40.480]  people run places like that, which I love I dig into. But the sports writing that we
[1:05:40.480 --> 1:05:44.720]  had for years and what you still get in places like ESPN and stuff like that at least in the front
[1:05:44.720 --> 1:05:52.400]  page is the mythological great man or a great woman, you know, overcoming adversity to, to, to win
[1:05:52.400 --> 1:06:00.000]  the day. Uh, when that's actually, that's a story. And, and it's not how products are made. But again,
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:07.120]  like I said, it's on Apple to create the myth. And it's the myth making that, that has gone.
[1:06:07.120 --> 1:06:12.240]  Yeah. Do you want to read the first paragraph of this iPhone killer story, or at least the
[1:06:13.520 --> 1:06:18.480]  I guess the second paragraph, there is a paragraph marker. No, it's a, no, it's the first,
[1:06:18.480 --> 1:06:24.000]  oh, yeah, you're right. Oh, because it's terrible way out. Yeah. Uh, yeah, uh, Kevin Lynch,
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:27.280]  I'll, I'll skip around a bit. I'll, I'll, I'll agree to the level of parks. Kevin Lynch accepted
[1:06:27.280 --> 1:06:31.920]  in early 2013, Kevin Lynch accepted the job offer from Apple. Funny thing about the offer,
[1:06:31.920 --> 1:06:36.560]  it didn't say what he would be doing that it, uh, it was odd that Apple even offered him a job
[1:06:36.560 --> 1:06:40.640]  during his eight years at Adobe, most recently his chief technology officer. He was best known
[1:06:40.640 --> 1:06:44.160]  as the only person dumb enough to publicly fight Steve Jobs with the iPhone's lack of support
[1:06:44.160 --> 1:06:48.320]  for flash videos, which of course he was into one, but whatever. Uh, when Lynch announced his
[1:06:48.320 --> 1:06:53.680]  move, the reaction was, was immediate. They want this guy, Apple blogger, John Gruber called Lynch,
[1:06:53.680 --> 1:07:01.600]  quote, a Bozo comma, a bad, higher period, unquote new paragraph. I didn't, though. And I know
[1:07:01.600 --> 1:07:07.120]  it's nuance and it's harsh, but when he was hired, this was actually exactly two years ago,
[1:07:07.680 --> 1:07:15.440]  uh, Tuesday 19th of March to 1 T 13. This is all in the headline. I'll put this in the show
[1:07:15.440 --> 1:07:24.000]  notes. Um, don't forget, um, exhibit A in the case that newly hired Apple VP of technology,
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  Kevin Lynch is a Bozo, a bad hire. Um, the nuance there is I didn't say he is a Bozo a bad hire.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:41.840]  I said there is a case to be made that he is and the case to me was, you know, not that it was good
[1:07:41.840 --> 1:07:48.720]  or that it was convincing, but, um, you know, and I quote from the blog posts that he had written
[1:07:48.720 --> 1:07:54.960]  at Adobe three years ago, talking about flash player and, and, um, so here's, this is these are
[1:07:54.960 --> 1:08:00.880]  words from Kevin Lynch. So three years before, so 2010, we are now in a verge of delivering flash
[1:08:00.880 --> 1:08:07.040]  player 10.1 for smartphones with all but one of the top manufacturers. This includes Google's
[1:08:07.040 --> 1:08:14.320]  Android, Rims, BlackBerry, Nokia, Palm Pre, and many others across form factors, including not
[1:08:14.320 --> 1:08:19.360]  only smartphones, but also tablets, networks, and internet connected TVs. Flash and the browser
[1:08:19.360 --> 1:08:24.640]  provides a competitive advantage to these devices because it will enable their customers to
[1:08:24.640 --> 1:08:31.440]  browse the whole web. Um, so those are Lynch's words, right? That's, you know, he wrote that,
[1:08:31.440 --> 1:08:36.320]  or at least he put his name on it. And I wrote, well, how'd that work out? Those companies and
[1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:43.040]  platforms are now either, this is, and this was two years ago, A, out of business, B, on the verge of
[1:08:43.040 --> 1:08:49.520]  going out of business or C, have abandoned flash player entirely. And even include D, that the web is
[1:08:49.520 --> 1:08:56.720]  kind of on, on deathwatch as it is. Yeah. Well, it was, at least on mobile and the watch, right? Um,
[1:08:59.040 --> 1:09:06.000]  so I stand by it. I'm, I'm not, you know, I, but I didn't say he was. I said there was a case to me
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:12.800]  made that he was. And I know that I'm, I'm asking for nuance that the press type typically doesn't
[1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:18.160]  give, but to me it's important. Like it's, you know, clearly we're going to judge Kevin Lynch on the
[1:09:18.160 --> 1:09:25.280]  quality of Apple Watch software. And, you know, he might prove himself that, you know, okay,
[1:09:25.280 --> 1:09:31.520]  you know, he was dealt a bad hand at Adobe. And the argument would be then that he was the loyal
[1:09:31.520 --> 1:09:36.000]  company man, and that he knew, he knew damn well when he wrote it, that it was a bad hand, and he
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:43.200]  was loyal to the company. Um, but I just, I don't like that, I don't like having it quoted that I said
[1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:48.560]  he was a bozo, because I didn't say that. And I wouldn't have, because I don't feel like, you know,
[1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:54.240]  this me, the nuance is important. I, it could be that he, he knew damn well that it was a pile of
[1:09:54.240 --> 1:09:59.200]  shit, and that he was just, you know, being the right, you know, doing, doing right by the company as
[1:09:59.200 --> 1:10:08.160]  he saw fit. Um, I don't know if I've ever, for, to be, to, to, to, yes, reading it, I have, I have to be
[1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:14.000]  honest, reading it, yes, you clearly said it is a case, you didn't say he was a bozo. Um, I will say
[1:10:14.640 --> 1:10:21.840]  that I very much remember your post about Kevin Lynch. And when I saw the quote in the article,
[1:10:21.840 --> 1:10:25.840]  A, I knew you'd be annoyed, but B, I thought it was totally fair, because that's what I
[1:10:25.840 --> 1:10:29.920]  remembered you saying. So it's not unfair. I wouldn't say unfair, but I feel like it misses the
[1:10:29.920 --> 1:10:36.160]  nuance. Um, and then there's another line from his, he wrote, he wrote, for example, the recent
[1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:42.160]  Nexus one from Google will rock with a great experience in the browser with flash player 10.1.
[1:10:42.800 --> 1:10:48.320]  And then I said, yeah, it rocked so hard. Google dropped flash player support from Android last year
[1:10:50.160 --> 1:10:53.440]  with a link to where Google dropped flash player support from Android.
[1:10:53.440 --> 1:10:59.280]  No, yeah, I mean, the, the wincing, though, like, there's no, I, I completely shared your skepticism.
[1:10:59.280 --> 1:11:05.040]  I mean, when I, I was, uh, I was in remain very critical of the, of the initial watch unveiling,
[1:11:05.040 --> 1:11:11.680]  again, for the exact same reason, uh, because I just felt the messaging was so poor. Um, and I
[1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:16.480]  called out the fact that boy, the Kevin Lynch part really bothered me. I was bothered when he was
[1:11:16.480 --> 1:11:21.920]  hired, uh, other people were bothered as hired, and I linked to this post, by the way. Um, and then
[1:11:21.920 --> 1:11:26.000]  I said, for me, at least is seeming inability to focus or prioritize the software demo, confirm
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:32.080]  many of those misgivings. Um, so no, I mean, there's no question that he, he had a ton of
[1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:38.880]  skepticism. I will say, uh, I thought he, I thought he crushed the, the watch event. Like, I,
[1:11:38.880 --> 1:11:44.800]  I thought he was by far the strongest part of the second watch event. I thought he captured, uh,
[1:11:45.760 --> 1:11:50.800]  the way the watch can rest remember whether you might, my, my, my, my case for the watch has always
[1:11:50.800 --> 1:11:56.640]  been. Um, again, I take more, less of a watch and watch him, the app watch particular and more
[1:11:56.640 --> 1:12:01.840]  of a, like, where is technology going view? And one, I think that's the natural next place. And
[1:12:01.840 --> 1:12:07.760]  two, I think what's interesting is, is the phone gave us the, the ability to, to interact with
[1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:12.160]  anyone, anything, anywhere in the world. But what the watch will give us is the chance to interact
[1:12:12.160 --> 1:12:17.120]  with everything in our physical environment. And that's what win, win, win, demoed. And that's more
[1:12:17.120 --> 1:12:23.200]  of a longer range of vision because a lot of this stuff for that isn't in place yet. Um, but,
[1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:29.840]  but that's, that's what he did. And that's why I'm bullish because I think that the watch makes sense,
[1:12:29.840 --> 1:12:35.040]  a, like, a watch makes sense. One, and two, Apple has deserves the benefit of the doubt. They,
[1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:40.240]  they've, they're, they're three for three right now. And if anyone's going to nail it, like,
[1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:45.280]  until they prove otherwise, I'll presume they will. And that's at the core. That's why I'm bullish.
[1:12:45.280 --> 1:12:51.360]  And I think Apple and Lynch in particular demonstrated that at the last event. Um, but that's not
[1:12:51.360 --> 1:12:57.200]  coming across in these articles. Um, one thing I heard when I wrote that, and I don't know if I,
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:02.800]  I don't think I wrote about it. I don't know if I don't remember if I set it on the, the show. But
[1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:08.160]  after I wrote that, this was back when, when he was first hired. One thing I heard from, let's say,
[1:13:08.160 --> 1:13:15.360]  well placed birdie in Cupertino, um, who would know somebody, I've birdie with a position who
[1:13:15.360 --> 1:13:22.000]  would know if it were true, um, said to me that, uh, in fact, Steve Jobs had personally recruited,
[1:13:23.040 --> 1:13:28.960]  uh, now obviously he was hired and if he was hired in 2013, 13, 13 two years ago,
[1:13:28.960 --> 1:13:35.680]  Steve Jobs was already dead. But what I heard from one source who would know was that jobs
[1:13:35.680 --> 1:13:42.640]  tried to recruit him years prior. I don't know exactly when probably 2010 or 2011, um,
[1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:52.880]  probably 2010 thinking about it. Uh, and he turned him down specifically because he thought it,
[1:13:52.880 --> 1:13:57.680]  he owed it to Adobe to stick with them and that it would, he, he thought it would look,
[1:13:57.680 --> 1:14:03.280]  but Lynch thought it would really make Adobe look bad if he left for Apple in the middle of the
[1:14:03.280 --> 1:14:08.320]  flash, in the middle of this flash player stuff, uh, and that he stuck with them out of loyalty,
[1:14:08.320 --> 1:14:13.920]  um, with Adobe out of loyalty. Now I, I did, you know, I would, if Lynch told me that, I would
[1:14:13.920 --> 1:14:18.480]  take it as fact. I heard it from the second hand source. So take it with a grain of salt. I don't
[1:14:18.480 --> 1:14:22.800]  know if that's true or if it's been, I don't know, but I heard that. I've been thinking, he,
[1:14:22.800 --> 1:14:28.480]  he was with my macro media. So presumably, I mean, he knew Shiller, um, that might have been,
[1:14:28.480 --> 1:14:34.000]  maybe that was the connection. I wonder though, because Shiller was there so long ago. That's true.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:37.440]  I mean, that's, we're talking mid 90s. So I don't know about that. Um,
[1:14:39.680 --> 1:14:42.720]  here's the thing though about the loyalty angle. Like to me, the best thing you can say about
[1:14:42.720 --> 1:14:48.480]  Lynch is if he believed all that stuff about flash player for being, for mobile, being a,
[1:14:48.480 --> 1:14:53.520]  you know, a great thing that's going to help everybody but Apple and that Apple should get on it.
[1:14:53.520 --> 1:15:02.560]  If you really thought in, in, in what was that 2011 or was it 2010, he wrote that in 2010,
[1:15:02.560 --> 1:15:08.400]  if you really thought that flash player for mobile was a winner for everybody but Apple and that
[1:15:08.400 --> 1:15:14.000]  Apple should get on board and do it to me, that's a damning because it's, it was just bad technology
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:20.560]  and it was really bad for mobile, you know, you know, I'm, I'm, I, I agree and you get to the,
[1:15:20.560 --> 1:15:26.480]  like the Johnny have article and talking about the idea that, you know, you're not being honest
[1:15:26.480 --> 1:15:33.280]  if you're not like being critical at the same time. Um, before I went to Microsoft, uh, and when
[1:15:33.280 --> 1:15:41.840]  they first unveiled Windows 8 at all things deep, uh, this would be 20, I think 2011. Um, I
[1:15:41.840 --> 1:15:47.040]  thought it was awful. I trashed it. I posted myself on Twitter at which I then, which unfortunately
[1:15:47.040 --> 1:15:50.480]  is no longer there because one of my classes like, dude, you know, you're going to work,
[1:15:50.480 --> 1:15:54.240]  there, right? So when I figured reading that and I already got in, people who follow me
[1:15:54.240 --> 1:15:56.960]  on Twitter, be shocked to hear this. I already got in trouble with my Twitter account previously.
[1:15:57.520 --> 1:16:03.200]  Uh, due to, due to Apple actually, um, it's one convoluted story. Um, not when I was at Apple,
[1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:10.000]  uh, it was a school thing. Um, so I, but then I went to, I went to Microsoft and I worked on,
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:16.400]  on Windows 8 and, uh, and one of the thing goes when, when you're working on it and you're recruiting
[1:16:16.400 --> 1:16:21.680]  and I was in charge of or not in charge, I was one of the people on the team getting developers to
[1:16:21.680 --> 1:16:27.440]  build for Windows 8. And you're kind of selling it, right? And you, you have, and there's a certain
[1:16:27.440 --> 1:16:36.160]  sense of like, I can't, I, yeah, maybe I should just quit. I don't really believe in it. But if you're,
[1:16:36.160 --> 1:16:40.800]  like that, you're fresh out of school, like is a big opportunity. Actually, someone,
[1:16:40.800 --> 1:16:44.640]  the teams got reorganized. I was doing a job several levels above me, ton of responsibility.
[1:16:44.640 --> 1:16:50.400]  You had a ton of, ton of impact. And there's, there's a kind of subconscious thing, like, well,
[1:16:52.320 --> 1:16:56.320]  maybe I have my doubts, but I'm going to kind of put those in a cover for now. And I'm going to
[1:16:56.320 --> 1:17:01.120]  work my ass off and do the best I can, which, which I did. And I told close friends, like, I
[1:17:01.120 --> 1:17:06.800]  told about my misgivings and like the issues with it. But boy, as far as it impacted my day,
[1:17:06.800 --> 1:17:11.680]  day, day, life, my professional life, like I was giving it my all. And sure enough, when it came
[1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:19.040]  out, like all my initial misgivings ended up being totally spot on. But I, I kind of look back
[1:17:19.040 --> 1:17:28.640]  that both humbled for sure and a little ashamed, but also appreciative for how it, you can lose
[1:17:28.640 --> 1:17:33.280]  sight of like what, what is true. And, and, and yeah, if you're someone like, like Johnny I have
[1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:39.520]  or arguably Kevin Lynch in his position, you have the luxury of, you can step off. But I don't,
[1:17:39.520 --> 1:17:43.680]  you have so many things in history where people kind of like just go down the wrong path and man,
[1:17:44.400 --> 1:17:53.680]  I, I join you in judging him. But I also empathize and sympathize because I, I feel bad about it.
[1:17:53.680 --> 1:17:58.080]  I feel bad that I sucked in at the same time. I can appreciate why that happened to me.
[1:17:58.080 --> 1:18:02.960]  Right. Cause and who knows what he was saying inside the dooby, right? I mean, that's, you know,
[1:18:02.960 --> 1:18:10.880]  what he said publicly, I, I would not want to put my name on something public that to go that
[1:18:10.880 --> 1:18:17.520]  all in on if I was the CTO of Adobe in 2010, there's no way I would have put my name on that publicly,
[1:18:17.520 --> 1:18:22.960]  even no matter how loyal I wanted to be to the company. And I realized that as, you know, the CTO of
[1:18:23.760 --> 1:18:28.240]  Adobe, he couldn't say anything bad about it at the time publicly. And that Adobe as a whole
[1:18:28.240 --> 1:18:35.680]  was going to market it and try to do it. But he had to know it was a bad technology. And I've
[1:18:35.680 --> 1:18:41.680]  really bad fit for mobile devices and processors in terms of performance and just where, you know,
[1:18:41.680 --> 1:18:48.000]  where everything was going. I mean, I took so much flak at the time from certain people with my
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:53.760]  adiments, my absolute adiments that, you know, that flash was terrible for mobile. I've, I've
[1:18:53.760 --> 1:18:58.080]  always thought flash was terrible even for desktop, but it was, you know, horrible. And at the best
[1:18:58.080 --> 1:19:05.120]  thing that ever happened to the web, the open web was Apple's refusal to put flash on these devices
[1:19:05.120 --> 1:19:14.080]  and it single-handedly, in my opinion, got video out of the proprietary and terribly performing
[1:19:14.080 --> 1:19:26.160]  flash player and into, you know, just, you know, HTML5 compatible with H264 and etc. That can be
[1:19:26.160 --> 1:19:32.400]  played more efficiently and openly and doesn't require any sort of lock-in to one particular
[1:19:32.400 --> 1:19:37.520]  plug-in architecture. Yeah. It's actually kind of stumbled across this personal website,
[1:19:37.520 --> 1:19:43.840]  um, via Wikipedia. And it has his kind of, you know, it's in paragraph form, but kind of what
[1:19:43.840 --> 1:19:51.360]  he's done. And there's no mention of the word flash. Well, surprisingly, it does a lot. It
[1:19:51.360 --> 1:19:55.600]  don't be as it's. It'll be helped to find real life creative cloud and Adobe marketing cloud.
[1:19:56.960 --> 1:20:01.360]  No flash. I didn't know earlier. This is Kevin Lynch from his website. I will put this in
[1:20:01.360 --> 1:20:07.600]  the show. If I write it down on paper, it'll get in. Earlier, I was a Mac software developer. I
[1:20:07.600 --> 1:20:12.480]  helped develop the first Mac release of Frame Maker and then led their core technology team. Frame
[1:20:12.480 --> 1:20:17.280]  technology was also acquired by Adobe prior to this. I helped establish one of the first Mac software
[1:20:17.280 --> 1:20:24.160]  startups in 1984. Frame Maker, do you ever use Frame Maker? Nope. Ooh, great, great software. Really
[1:20:24.160 --> 1:20:29.600]  great software. And the fact that it, like Adobe sort of, I guess it's gone now, I guess it's dead.
[1:20:29.600 --> 1:20:34.240]  I don't think it ever made the transition to OS 10. I think it was, I don't think there was ever
[1:20:34.240 --> 1:20:40.640]  a native OS 10 version of it. And it was strategically subsumed by in design. And in design was
[1:20:40.640 --> 1:20:45.440]  way more, the thing with Frame Maker, we used to, I used it at bare bones. We had the, it was super
[1:20:45.440 --> 1:20:53.120]  focused, right? Yeah, it, it wasn't quite as designery as I would like. And I used to, I used to live
[1:20:53.120 --> 1:20:58.640]  in Breathe and Quark Express. And so I mean, yeah, that's, that's what I knew. I used Quark Express. I would, I
[1:20:58.640 --> 1:21:05.520]  would get frustrated by some of the ways that frame it wasn't as design, like, Quark, I could make
[1:21:05.520 --> 1:21:11.520]  a thing print out with the exact design I wanted down to, I, I'm going to say 100th of an inch,
[1:21:11.520 --> 1:21:15.760]  but it might have even been 1000th of an inch. I mean, and it was spot on accurate. And then it
[1:21:15.760 --> 1:21:21.120]  would just, you know, it would come out of the printer exactly everything positioned exactly where I
[1:21:21.120 --> 1:21:26.480]  wanted it. And Frame Maker didn't let you position things quite as precisely as, as Quark. But the
[1:21:26.480 --> 1:21:32.240]  thing that Frame had was these book making features where you could select, like, like for making,
[1:21:32.240 --> 1:21:38.320]  here's the canonical example is to make an index for the book is you could select text and say,
[1:21:38.320 --> 1:21:46.560]  I want to make an index entry right here. And you got precise control over what the entry and the index
[1:21:46.560 --> 1:21:51.760]  would be called where it pointed to. And then as you edited the document and move things around,
[1:21:51.760 --> 1:21:57.680]  it just worked. Right. It, it, you just did not have to worry about your index connections
[1:21:57.680 --> 1:22:02.480]  breaking or working. It was brilliant. And it really, really, and it's a tricky, tricky problem to
[1:22:02.480 --> 1:22:09.840]  solve. Really, I mean, the doing a good index for a book is, uh, infamously difficult and expensive
[1:22:09.840 --> 1:22:15.120]  to get someone to do it. And, you know, at the time, and the, you know, BB at its manual was there.
[1:22:15.120 --> 1:22:21.440]  I mean, it was, I don't know, it was like 300 pages. Um, and had a great index. And it was so
[1:22:21.440 --> 1:22:26.880]  easy. Frame Maker made it so easy to keep that index up to date as you went and, you know,
[1:22:26.880 --> 1:22:31.440]  added new features and stuff. Great, great, great ad. So that's, that's a, that's a feather in his cap.
[1:22:36.240 --> 1:22:40.080]  Well, we all, we all have, we all have our ups and downs.
[1:22:40.080 --> 1:22:46.720]  Like I said, I was hoping we were not going to have a watch now or an hour and a half in. So
[1:22:47.920 --> 1:22:51.760]  I do. It's funny that you brought it up though, because that's exactly where I was going with the
[1:22:51.760 --> 1:22:58.880]  whole, on, you know, like, with, with his role with flash and mobile is on one side, he really
[1:22:58.880 --> 1:23:03.600]  believed that it was the, you know, could be a, could be the future of mobile, which would indicate
[1:23:03.600 --> 1:23:10.240]  that he's a buzzing. I don't believe that. I think that I, my guess is that he knew exactly
[1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:16.160]  what the score was. And he was just being loyal to Adobe. That though, like you said, in and of itself
[1:23:16.160 --> 1:23:22.000]  is maybe not loyalty as a general thing is great. But maybe in that case, it's like, I was,
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:27.120]  I was going to go there with the Johnny I've story about Steve Jobs saying, you know, don't just
[1:23:27.120 --> 1:23:30.560]  say good things about it. You got to be honest. If you're not being honest, you're doing a disservice
[1:23:30.560 --> 1:23:36.400]  to the people you're talking to. And that it was a disservice, you know, to Adobe to, to let
[1:23:36.400 --> 1:23:42.960]  them keep pushing flash forward. Because it's so, it's so, it's so rare though. I mean, it's,
[1:23:42.960 --> 1:23:48.640]  it's especially in big companies. Right. And Adobe is doing pretty good. Their last quarter,
[1:23:48.640 --> 1:23:54.400]  their results were pretty good. And I'm happy to see that. I think, I think the industry is better
[1:23:54.400 --> 1:23:59.600]  with a healthy, strong, successful Adobe as an independent company. Oh, no, I completely agree. And
[1:23:59.600 --> 1:24:05.680]  the way they've, in the way they've transitioned their products to being, to being a service,
[1:24:05.680 --> 1:24:12.240]  basically, has been really impressive. No, I completely agree. Actually, just, they just released
[1:24:12.240 --> 1:24:17.600]  a new app a couple of hours ago. I don't know if you've seen it yet. Adobe slate, a visual story,
[1:24:17.600 --> 1:24:22.640]  storytelling out for the iPad, where you can basically use photos and text to create, like,
[1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:31.920]  to create a story. And it's, it feels so, like, Adobe-esque in the best possible way. Right. It's,
[1:24:31.920 --> 1:24:36.880]  like, letting you weigh stuff out, create something that looks really, really great to create,
[1:24:36.880 --> 1:24:42.080]  like, your own product, in a sense. Like Adobe lets you create, let's you create products
[1:24:42.080 --> 1:24:47.280]  in the best possible sense. And, or when they're at their best. And what's, what's fascinating
[1:24:47.280 --> 1:24:55.280]  about this is, like, who is arguably, if you think about it, who is, who, if anyone is pushing
[1:24:55.280 --> 1:25:00.400]  the envelope in the iPad right now? Like, there, there aren't many and one to be fascinating,
[1:25:00.400 --> 1:25:05.760]  if kind of like the, the, the two companies that arguably are producing some of the most
[1:25:05.760 --> 1:25:10.880]  complaining iPad apps right now are Adobe and Microsoft. Yeah. Like, it's like a replay.
[1:25:10.880 --> 1:25:18.320]  All right. Yeah. It is a replay to the Mac, right? Yeah. Because let's just say that 84, 84 was,
[1:25:18.320 --> 1:25:24.720]  you know, the original Mac was a severely limited machine, 85, 86, 87 or so is when I would say
[1:25:24.720 --> 1:25:32.800]  the Mac really kind of got up off the ground in terms of the performance of the, I don't know if
[1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:40.640]  they were up to the 68, 0, 20 yet. But it was getting close, you know, the 68, 0, 20s and the 68,
[1:25:40.640 --> 1:25:48.480]  0, 30s eventually. But other, and with other form factors where you could get bigger displays
[1:25:48.480 --> 1:25:54.960]  and stuff like that. And more RAM. And then famously, you know, the desktop publishing industry,
[1:25:55.680 --> 1:26:00.080]  which was built on the Mac, that didn't come from Apple. Apple never had a desktop publishing app.
[1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:04.240]  I mean, Apple came out with the laser writer, which certainly helped, but, you know, it was
[1:26:04.240 --> 1:26:12.080]  software from Adobe and Quark and, um, who did page maker out this? Yup. Uh, that really made
[1:26:12.080 --> 1:26:18.640]  that an industry. And again, Microsoft, it was apps like Excel, Excel started on the Mac, right?
[1:26:18.640 --> 1:26:26.000]  Or at least became a kid on the Mac started on the Mac. Uh, Microsoft Word was a huge Mac app.
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:32.640]  Uh, you know, lots of great software from Microsoft for the app for, for the Mac and the 80s.
[1:26:32.640 --> 1:26:37.360]  And absolutely helped make the Mac for, and obviously never gotten entrenched as a widespread,
[1:26:37.360 --> 1:26:42.240]  you know, business computer. But it, in places that did have Macs, it was Microsoft software that
[1:26:42.240 --> 1:26:50.320]  made it, uh, plausible. Yeah, that would be interesting. And I do think that I, I, I, I, I,
[1:26:50.320 --> 1:26:56.400]  I know this is a little kind of version. I kind of feel like, um, you know, Apple, you know,
[1:26:56.400 --> 1:27:00.880]  to some extent, the way that I feel they've limited the app store and limited the ability to build
[1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:05.440]  sustainable apps. Um, in my estimation, you know, without, not having things like trials,
[1:27:05.440 --> 1:27:12.720]  not having things like easy upgrades. Um, I, I kind of feel like that one, there's the whole,
[1:27:12.720 --> 1:27:17.840]  you know, commoditizer compliments like cheap apps is good for the platform within, within a
[1:27:17.840 --> 1:27:23.520]  certain limit. Um, but on the other hand, I think they, they remembered, you know, being in that
[1:27:23.520 --> 1:27:27.760]  position where it got to the point where the Microsoft and Adobe apps were more important than
[1:27:27.760 --> 1:27:32.720]  the Mac, right? And like Steve Jobs had to like prostrate it, prostate himself, uh,
[1:27:32.720 --> 1:27:39.200]  prostrate it, said from, um, we might have to edit that out. Um, no way, no way are we
[1:27:39.200 --> 1:27:43.680]  editing that out. But it's, it's, it's really morbid because you're doing the first time talking about,
[1:27:43.680 --> 1:27:51.920]  um, uh, you know, like almost like, literally with this massive visage of Bill Gates up on his
[1:27:51.920 --> 1:27:57.920]  screen, you know, Microsoft riding into the rescue. And then Adobe, when they went to OS 10,
[1:27:57.920 --> 1:28:01.920]  Adobe wouldn't even come over, right? Like they refuse them. Like our customers aren't really
[1:28:01.920 --> 1:28:07.840]  there. And, um, you know, I, I feel like Apple never wanted to be able to host these two app
[1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:14.800]  makers again. And, and it turns out though, because no one's really been able to build,
[1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:20.480]  especially in the productivity space, a meaningful business on, on the iPad in particular,
[1:28:20.480 --> 1:28:25.360]  like it turns out it's the same guys that are there and it's Microsoft and, and it's Adobe.
[1:28:25.360 --> 1:28:31.200]  And, um, I just find it fascinating and kind of like the, the history of this relationship.
[1:28:31.200 --> 1:28:37.120]  Yeah, they were definitely, I think that with, and again, I don't want to go on a huge
[1:28:37.120 --> 1:28:46.080]  digression about circa 1997 industry politics. But, um, it is interesting though, I do think so,
[1:28:46.080 --> 1:28:52.400]  that, you know, that Adobe and Microsoft at least, especially combined, held far more sway over
[1:28:52.400 --> 1:28:58.640]  Apple's future than Apple itself did. Yep. You know, maybe they could have gotten by with one
[1:28:58.640 --> 1:29:05.520]  and on board and not the other, either way, but not both. And, you know, and it, it's certainly,
[1:29:05.520 --> 1:29:10.080]  you know, exemplified with the original rap city introduction, like with the first, you know,
[1:29:10.080 --> 1:29:17.200]  the first plan that was announced post next reunification, which was a very, it was much,
[1:29:17.200 --> 1:29:24.160]  it was more or less, uh, the next step operating system without carbon. It was, you're going to
[1:29:24.160 --> 1:29:28.400]  have to rewrite for cocoa. I don't even know if they'd called it cocoa yet, but more or less,
[1:29:28.400 --> 1:29:32.560]  you know, it was more or less we're going to, you know, we're going to do a, uh, put a new
[1:29:32.560 --> 1:29:39.280]  Apple style UI on the next step operating system, right? And there was no, there's no carbon, no carbon.
[1:29:39.280 --> 1:29:46.160]  And that went over like a lead balloon. And more or less, like Microsoft said, we're not doing that,
[1:29:46.160 --> 1:29:50.640]  because it would be a rewrite, right? And everybody knows, you know, going from this existing code
[1:29:50.640 --> 1:29:57.600]  bases on the Mac, uh, to pure next step would have been, it's a complete rewrite. It's a
[1:29:57.600 --> 1:30:02.160]  all new platform. And they were going, no, we're not going to do it. And Adobe was like, nope, does,
[1:30:02.160 --> 1:30:06.400]  that's, that does not its starter. And they Apple announced it, right? I mean, and then they had to
[1:30:06.400 --> 1:30:11.760]  backtrack. And that's four stalls decision. It was forced, Scott Forstahl, who really was the champion
[1:30:11.760 --> 1:30:18.240]  of carbon within Apple, uh, which I still think is one of the most telling stories that, that
[1:30:18.240 --> 1:30:26.240]  paints four stalls as a, uh, complex figure, you know, it's, there's no way to just say, oh, he was a,
[1:30:26.240 --> 1:30:30.800]  he was a jerk and so they fired him. Um, because if that was true, I mean, and he was a guy,
[1:30:30.800 --> 1:30:34.240]  you know, I think he went to work at next right out of college. I mean, he'd been in it. I mean,
[1:30:34.240 --> 1:30:39.680]  I think all he'd ever done at professional life was work for, for next. And it was only platforming
[1:30:39.680 --> 1:30:45.280]  new. And yet he was the guy spearheading, um, we need to support, we need to create this carbon
[1:30:45.280 --> 1:30:49.600]  thing to support this legacy stuff. You know, whereas the public, the perception from outside Apple
[1:30:49.600 --> 1:30:54.080]  was that the next people came in and had no respect for the Mac stuff that was already there.
[1:30:54.080 --> 1:30:57.200]  And it couldn't be further. I mean, there might be some people who are like that, but Forstahl
[1:30:57.200 --> 1:31:01.200]  exemplifies that it, you know, there were, there were, here was a guy who couldn't have been more pure
[1:31:01.200 --> 1:31:08.480]  blood next, who was pushing for carbon, which was what got them on board. And I think it was the
[1:31:08.480 --> 1:31:13.120]  right decision, but I think jobs always resented that they had to do that, right? That that's
[1:31:13.120 --> 1:31:18.080]  absolutely right. It's the fact that they didn't control their own destiny. Yeah, and that, yeah,
[1:31:18.080 --> 1:31:25.680]  and that's, yeah, and that, that is so core to, to Apple now. And, and, you know, the way,
[1:31:26.400 --> 1:31:31.040]  the way they think about all their business. Yeah, let me take a break here and thank
[1:31:31.600 --> 1:31:39.840]  our next sponsor of the show, Casper. Have you heard about Casper? I have Casper is amazing.
[1:31:40.320 --> 1:31:43.840]  It sounds amazing. Sounds like something I'll make up. Sounds like an April Fool's joke.
[1:31:43.840 --> 1:31:48.080]  They're an online retailer of premium mattresses for a fraction of the price.
[1:31:50.080 --> 1:31:53.280]  Sounds like an April Fool's joke. You go online and buy a mattress. No, seriously,
[1:31:53.280 --> 1:31:57.520]  this is what you do. You go there. They've, it's truly, it's revel, it's a complete different
[1:31:57.520 --> 1:32:03.280]  approach than the standard mattress industry. None of this confusing product names. The,
[1:32:03.280 --> 1:32:07.200]  the regular mattress makers, it's all, it's, it's seriously, it is, I don't even think it's any
[1:32:07.200 --> 1:32:14.880]  exaggeration to call it a cartel. They, they, they keep prices high. They use all these confusing
[1:32:14.880 --> 1:32:19.360]  product names for their mattresses to make it as difficult as possible to comparison shop,
[1:32:19.360 --> 1:32:24.640]  because when you go to one store and try the silly, whatever, whatever, and then you go to another
[1:32:24.640 --> 1:32:29.760]  store and try a silly, that product isn't even there. It's all got different names, even though it's
[1:32:29.760 --> 1:32:34.320]  the exact same mattress. And therefore, it makes it really, really hard to tell which one is
[1:32:34.320 --> 1:32:39.360]  which, forget about all that nonsense. You go to Casper's website and they have one mattress
[1:32:39.360 --> 1:32:47.120]  technology. It is one of a kind thing. It is a hybrid mattress that combines premium latex foam
[1:32:47.120 --> 1:32:53.200]  with memory foam. I've had one sent to me. I've tried it. It's really good. I don't like pure
[1:32:53.200 --> 1:32:56.880]  memory foam mattresses. It is not like that at all. It's not some kind of thing where you get up
[1:32:56.880 --> 1:33:02.880]  off the bed and there's like a corpse shape bedded in the mattress, which I don't like that at all.
[1:33:02.880 --> 1:33:06.560]  It's not like that at all. It's just enough of the memory foam style stuff that it just makes
[1:33:06.560 --> 1:33:13.840]  it comfortable while you're laying there. Great mattress. Really great. It shows up at your door
[1:33:13.840 --> 1:33:19.760]  in a box. It's a big box, but it is not a mattress sized box. It is, to me, is the most amazing
[1:33:19.760 --> 1:33:25.760]  part of it. It shows up in a little like a dorm room refrigerator box. You think there's a
[1:33:25.760 --> 1:33:29.920]  queen sized mattress in there, a king sized mattress? Well, take it up to the room where you want it.
[1:33:29.920 --> 1:33:35.200]  Again, they tell you this in instructions. Do not open the box in another room. Go to the room,
[1:33:35.200 --> 1:33:40.240]  go to your bedroom, open the box, and all of a sudden there's a mattress. It's amazing.
[1:33:42.160 --> 1:33:48.320]  Prices are fantastic. Regular mattresses, premium mattresses usually sell for over 1,500 bucks, 2,000
[1:33:48.320 --> 1:33:56.640]  or more. Casper mattresses are way lower than that. 500 for a twin sized mattress, 750 for full,
[1:33:56.640 --> 1:34:02.800]  850 for queen size, and just 950 bucks for a king sized mattress. Truly, truly great prices.
[1:34:04.160 --> 1:34:08.960]  Here's the thing. They totally understand. Casper understands that buying a mattress online,
[1:34:08.960 --> 1:34:13.840]  without ever feeling it, without trying it out, laying down on it, seems weird. It seems like,
[1:34:13.840 --> 1:34:17.200]  you know, even 950 bucks, even though it's a great price, who wants to spend a thousand bucks on
[1:34:17.200 --> 1:34:23.520]  mattress, so you never even tried. So here's the deal. It's completely risk-free. You don't like it
[1:34:23.520 --> 1:34:29.600]  up to 100 days. If you don't like it, just call them up, say, I don't want it up to 100 days,
[1:34:29.600 --> 1:34:33.280]  they'll come and get it from you and take it back and give you your money back. It's that simple.
[1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:36.880]  Statistically, here's the thing they have. Lying on a bed for four minutes in the showroom has
[1:34:36.880 --> 1:34:42.720]  no correlation with your eventual satisfaction to the mattress. The fact that you can try them in
[1:34:42.720 --> 1:34:46.240]  retail stores doesn't even matter in terms of finding when you're actually going to like to sleep.
[1:34:46.240 --> 1:34:53.280]  And Casper, I forget what their old demo period was, but it was less than 100 days.
[1:34:53.280 --> 1:34:58.400]  And so few people were sending back their mattresses that they extended it to 100 days, because
[1:34:58.400 --> 1:35:02.800]  they were so confident once they had data that people really, really love their Casper mattresses.
[1:35:04.560 --> 1:35:08.400]  So that's everything you need to know. Oh, one more thing. They're made in America,
[1:35:08.400 --> 1:35:13.840]  which I think is pretty cool. Made right here in the USA. So here's what you do.
[1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:21.440]  Go to caspersleep.com slash talk show. Caspersleep.com slash talk show,
[1:35:22.320 --> 1:35:27.600]  and you'll save some bucks and you don't know you came from the show. So my thanks to them.
[1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:30.880]  If you need a mattress, go check them out at caspersleep.com slash talk show.
[1:35:33.040 --> 1:35:34.160]  All right. What else you want to talk about?
[1:35:37.280 --> 1:35:42.320]  What else do I want to talk about? Well, it's actually been it's been a pretty busy week.
[1:35:42.320 --> 1:35:48.640]  The, I thought the title thing was interesting. The music thing. I wrote about that.
[1:35:49.840 --> 1:35:55.120]  The Jay-Z streaming service. There's been the Amazon button, which I love.
[1:35:55.120 --> 1:36:00.400]  You were debating if it's either if it's genius or stupid. I think it's I think it's absolutely genius.
[1:36:02.080 --> 1:36:06.480]  All right, then we've already had to good list. Let's see if we can tackle some of these quickly.
[1:36:06.480 --> 1:36:12.800]  The Jay-Z music service. I think it, here's my take. I haven't read in D-Type.
[1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:17.200]  It's, it's been busy week. My high level take on it. What's it called?
[1:36:18.240 --> 1:36:22.080]  Title T-I-D-A-L like like the ocean tide.
[1:36:22.080 --> 1:36:27.440]  Right. Number one bad name because it's indistinguishable audibly from title.
[1:36:27.440 --> 1:36:38.560]  Like your, you know, T-I-T-L-E bad product name. This to me reeks of everybody. Well, I don't know
[1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:45.840]  that we know. But we're pretty close to knowing that Beats Audio, Apple's Beats Audio is relaunching soon.
[1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:51.200]  Under, I don't know if it's going to keep the name or if it's going to be rebranded under iTunes
[1:36:51.200 --> 1:36:55.680]  or Apple or something like that, you know, Apple music, who knows. But it's coming.
[1:36:55.680 --> 1:37:05.920]  I think probably at WWDC and if not, soon thereafter, but I think they would love to announce
[1:37:05.920 --> 1:37:12.640]  that at WWDC. Everybody knows it's coming and it just this title thing from Jay-Z sounds like,
[1:37:12.640 --> 1:37:16.640]  well, let's hurry up and announce something beforehand.
[1:37:18.160 --> 1:37:22.320]  Well, I mean, it is, it is shipping like you can sign up for it right now.
[1:37:22.320 --> 1:37:28.080]  But it's, it, I think it's just pretty much a rebrand of the service that they bought.
[1:37:28.080 --> 1:37:31.040]  The thing that I thought interesting with in relation to the Apple thing was there was,
[1:37:32.160 --> 1:37:34.800]  well, first off, there was some reports at the end of last year. I think originally
[1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:39.360]  you're posted about about Jimmy Ivee in an Apple trying to sign up exclusives for their service.
[1:37:39.920 --> 1:37:45.920]  And after the title of there was an interview with Jay-Z in, in Billboard, where they asked
[1:37:45.920 --> 1:37:52.160]  him specifically about, about competing with Ivee and, and he said he's like, speaking with
[1:37:52.160 --> 1:37:55.680]  Billboard about bidding competitively with Ivee and behind the scenes of title and beat
[1:37:55.680 --> 1:38:00.880]  respect of launches. Jay-Z said, my thing with Jimmy is listen, Jimmy, you're Jimmy Ivee and
[1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:04.320]  you're an Apple truthfully, you're great to do to, to say, you don't have to do this. We don't
[1:38:04.320 --> 1:38:08.880]  like, I don't have to lose in order for you guys to win. Let's just remember that like, sorry Jay-Z.
[1:38:08.880 --> 1:38:17.600]  As long as Ivee is with Apple, Apple will absolutely be out to win. And they're not going to play
[1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:22.720]  nicely for the good of music. And it just, it's very convenient that the good of music, according
[1:38:22.720 --> 1:38:30.480]  to this group, is happens to be very good for them personally. And, and actually it happens to be
[1:38:30.480 --> 1:38:36.800]  good for their labels too. Yeah, I'm skeptical. It doesn't really change anything. And if it doesn't
[1:38:36.800 --> 1:38:42.240]  change anything, and if there's not going to be any meaningful exclusives in particular,
[1:38:43.040 --> 1:38:47.280]  then they're competing on the merits of the product. Presumably, though, I have some exclusives from Jay-Z.
[1:38:48.240 --> 1:38:52.080]  Well, now there's going to be out there. But they don't. The only exclusive they have at
[1:38:52.080 --> 1:38:58.880]  watch that is meaningful is Rihanna's latest single. They don't really have anything else. People
[1:38:58.880 --> 1:39:02.320]  report that Taylor Swift's back catalog, but Taylor Swift's back catalogs on beats right now.
[1:39:02.320 --> 1:39:06.080]  It's on audio. It's on any service that doesn't have a free tier. Like her objection was always
[1:39:06.080 --> 1:39:11.120]  to the, to the free tier. So no, they don't only have exclusives and they won't have exclusives
[1:39:11.120 --> 1:39:17.280]  because to put to from a label perspective. And frankly, from an artist perspective, to have an
[1:39:17.280 --> 1:39:24.160]  exclusive is dumb. Like the cost in making music is upfront. It's actually recording the music.
[1:39:24.160 --> 1:39:29.040]  Like once it's recorded, you want to get it in as many channels as possible, right? Because your
[1:39:29.040 --> 1:39:33.760]  your marginal cost is zero. So you want to sell as many as possible as means having it everywhere.
[1:39:33.760 --> 1:39:39.520]  And so the very idea of exclusive, like it just doesn't like all the, you're having like a mixture
[1:39:39.520 --> 1:39:44.400]  of business models and stuff like that. And which means that all the left is compete with on the
[1:39:44.400 --> 1:39:49.280]  product. Well, you've got to get something in exchange. Look at when the Apple landed the Beatles
[1:39:49.280 --> 1:39:57.680]  catalog. It clearly that was in exchange for an enormous marketing campaign. Yep, right? I mean,
[1:39:57.680 --> 1:40:03.200]  Apple was running Beatles ads. Apple was paying for them. It was an enormous campaign to promote it.
[1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:06.640]  You have to get something. You can't just say, okay, it's an exclusive. And it's only on this thing.
[1:40:06.640 --> 1:40:11.680]  You've got to be getting to do that. You've got to be getting something either promotional or cash,
[1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:18.000]  you know, to make it worthwhile. Right. And then the ones that control it, or especially
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:23.200]  anything in the back catalog, it's mostly the labels. And like their, the labels interest is
[1:40:23.200 --> 1:40:28.400]  having is like, they're fine to have a bunch of these guys like competing with each other.
[1:40:28.400 --> 1:40:34.960]  I mean, that's why I'm long-term, you know, bearish on Spotify. Like I don't like subscription
[1:40:34.960 --> 1:40:41.040]  services in general. I think they're great value for the consumer. But they're, you know,
[1:40:41.040 --> 1:40:49.280]  I think they're a bad idea for most, for, for most artists. But like as long as they, as long
[1:40:49.280 --> 1:40:53.680]  as they exist, I don't know, I lost my train of thought. I was going to work film.
[1:40:53.680 --> 1:40:57.760]  Well, here's my thing on Jay Z's attitude. That's the one, that's the one third day I'm
[1:40:57.760 --> 1:41:02.320]  lost the train of thought. You don't have to, you don't have to win or we don't have to lose
[1:41:02.320 --> 1:41:07.440]  for you to win blah, blah, blah. Comparing contrast to video with video, the Apple doesn't have
[1:41:07.440 --> 1:41:16.240]  their own custom content, right? Apple doesn't have Apple produced shows. So Apple can treat Netflix
[1:41:16.240 --> 1:41:25.920]  and HBO go and HBO. What's the new one? HBO now, you know, and you know, Apple doesn't have to,
[1:41:25.920 --> 1:41:30.400]  you know, there is no competition with Apple. Well, guess what Apple does sell music and Apple
[1:41:31.200 --> 1:41:35.040]  view on how much of the music out there they should be selling is all of it.
[1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:38.960]  Well, not just that, but this if, you know, if and when Apple launches a streaming service,
[1:41:38.960 --> 1:41:43.040]  that's a zero-sum game. No one is going to be subscribed to multiple streaming services.
[1:41:43.040 --> 1:41:46.880]  Right. Yeah, that's another good example, right? Because people, yeah, and that's another
[1:41:46.880 --> 1:41:52.240]  difference of video where you might, in fact, I am both a Netflix subscriber and an HBO subscriber
[1:41:52.240 --> 1:41:57.920]  because I want to watch both shows that are on exclusive to Netflix and exclusive to HBO.
[1:41:58.480 --> 1:42:02.240]  Right. But those are, but those are like their vertical business models, like they're Apple
[1:42:02.240 --> 1:42:07.360]  like in a way, right? They're using their exclusive content to get you to sign up for their service
[1:42:07.360 --> 1:42:13.360]  because you can only get House of Cards on Netflix. You can only get Game of Thrones on HBO
[1:42:13.360 --> 1:42:18.240]  whereas when it comes to the catalog to music because it's controlled by the labels and they want
[1:42:18.240 --> 1:42:22.880]  to be everywhere, that means all the services end up having pretty much the same stuff.
[1:42:25.120 --> 1:42:30.880]  What else was going on this week? Well, along those lines, actually, I thought I love this story
[1:42:30.880 --> 1:42:34.560]  because it was so, like it was so classic Apple. It's funny, I thought we're going to have an
[1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:42.080]  Apple all, but I guess the way it goes. There's a story yesterday in Recode about how Apple is going
[1:42:42.080 --> 1:42:50.400]  to get for their TV service. They want to get the networks to pay for the streaming. So basically
[1:42:50.400 --> 1:42:55.520]  Apple will sign up on the network, so I'm all on there. And instead of the networks delivering
[1:42:55.520 --> 1:43:01.360]  their content to Apple and then Apple streams with Apple TV, they will all they'll stream individually
[1:43:01.360 --> 1:43:05.680]  to the Apple TV. And the code here is great. Eddie Q, who is at the company's media efforts and
[1:43:05.680 --> 1:43:08.960]  leading to go exchange for the streaming service, has told them that Apple feels it should concentrate
[1:43:08.960 --> 1:43:12.640]  on what it's best at, creating a super hardware and software and leave other tasks extremely
[1:43:12.640 --> 1:43:19.520]  infrastructure for people who specialize in it. This is so great on multiple levels. It's great
[1:43:19.520 --> 1:43:24.640]  because one, it's true. And honestly, I don't want Apple focusing on the streaming. I don't want
[1:43:24.640 --> 1:43:30.800]  Chinese dubbing. Two, you missed that because you actually had the first Apple. Yeah. And the one where I
[1:43:30.800 --> 1:43:36.160]  couldn't make it last last month was great. The stream was perfect for me. And the only complaint I
[1:43:36.160 --> 1:43:39.760]  saw of others was that other people seemed to get on one that was a minute or two behind.
[1:43:40.400 --> 1:43:46.240]  Yeah, that's the case with streaming always. I watched the NBA a lot, a week pass. And I'm always
[1:43:46.240 --> 1:43:50.000]  slightly behind Twitter, which sucks because it's something big will happen. And I'll see it first.
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:57.200]  But, but you know, so this Apple thing, wouldn't that be a cool Twitter client feature if you
[1:43:57.200 --> 1:44:02.720]  could tell your Twitter client to put you five minutes behind? It would be, it would be fantastic.
[1:44:02.720 --> 1:44:10.080]  Oh, Twitter, we were talking about that, I think. But yeah, the other thing that's great about
[1:44:10.080 --> 1:44:18.720]  this is this is what Apple does again and again in industry after industry is because Apple has
[1:44:18.720 --> 1:44:24.480]  such a dominant hold on the consumer in the customer relationship. What they end up doing is they get
[1:44:24.480 --> 1:44:30.320]  other people to do the really expensive, uh, undifferentiated commodity work for them.
[1:44:31.040 --> 1:44:35.360]  And then, and then Apple gets to blame them and it goes wrong. So like with the iPhone, right,
[1:44:35.360 --> 1:44:40.720]  what's the actual expensive part of, of an iPhone? It's all, it's the carrier service,
[1:44:40.720 --> 1:44:48.320]  like the amount of money it costs to build up a network is, is, is massive. Uh, but Apple doesn't
[1:44:48.320 --> 1:44:52.960]  do any of that. They get the carriers to do it for them and the carriers and, and when the call
[1:44:52.960 --> 1:44:57.200]  goes bad, you can't get online, do you blame Apple? No, you blame AT&T. And, and then they
[1:44:57.200 --> 1:45:03.360]  leverage that into getting Verizon to take it because Verizon losing customers to AT&T. And, and you
[1:45:03.360 --> 1:45:08.000]  see this Apple do this again and again. Like they at the banks, the banks are paying Apple for the
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:14.240]  privilege of Apple pay. Why? Because the banks are fearful that people will switch banks just to get
[1:45:14.240 --> 1:45:18.960]  access to Apple pay. And, and now they're going to do this with this network thing that the networks
[1:45:18.960 --> 1:45:22.480]  like are looking for alternative revenue streams. They want to get, they want to be a part of the
[1:45:22.480 --> 1:45:27.360]  Apple thing and Apple, you can, you can see it. Like Apple has them real then, and then Apple
[1:45:27.360 --> 1:45:31.200]  like, oh, by the way, we're not so good at this streaming thing. Why don't you take care of that?
[1:45:31.200 --> 1:45:36.240]  Guess what? That's, that is really expensive. And there's no value ad. It's a pure commodity.
[1:45:36.240 --> 1:45:40.480]  And Apple is going to somehow get out of paying it. I think at the interesting conversation,
[1:45:40.480 --> 1:45:46.960]  email conversation yesterday with our friend Darth of, you know, the, the greatest guy in the internet.
[1:45:47.680 --> 1:45:56.160]  Yes, the, the, with the greatest avatar. Yeah. And he was surprised by it because he's his take
[1:45:56.160 --> 1:46:00.480]  was Apple, he was surprised that Apple wouldn't want to control that because, and his take,
[1:46:00.480 --> 1:46:06.240]  and I think he's right here, is that if the stream for somebody's stream on this new Apple TV is
[1:46:06.240 --> 1:46:10.880]  shitty, people are going to blame Apple because we may know as insiders that Apple, the way that
[1:46:10.880 --> 1:46:16.080]  they've architected this is that you bring your own streaming technology, you know, you know,
[1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:20.640]  you bring your, your own servers and streaming stuff. The consumer isn't going to know that. The
[1:46:20.640 --> 1:46:26.000]  consumer is going to know I bought the new Apple TV and I went to whatever it is. The, I wanted
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:30.960]  to watch the NBA thing and the stream sucked Apple TV sucks. But what if every stream works
[1:46:30.960 --> 1:46:36.320]  except for that one? Like what it see, see best is, is, is patchy, but every other stream works fine.
[1:46:36.320 --> 1:46:41.120]  Like, right. Then now who is going to get blamed, right? Maybe then a, even a consumer would figure
[1:46:41.120 --> 1:46:47.760]  out, you know, oh, I guess I should blame the NBA. I mean, we had this, we have this conversation
[1:46:47.760 --> 1:46:55.920]  on Twitter last night about, about this topic. And, and someone pointed out that, if you want to
[1:46:55.920 --> 1:47:00.880]  take a cynical view of things, Steve Jobs managed to successfully blame the iPhone 4 on people
[1:47:00.880 --> 1:47:08.640]  holding it wrong. So never don't, you can always ask just how far Apple can, can get people to
[1:47:08.640 --> 1:47:13.680]  admit. Actually, it was our fault. Yeah. Well, any other fact, I think it's complicated that the
[1:47:13.680 --> 1:47:18.480]  other factor is some of these companies really do do streaming well. Netflix streaming is pretty
[1:47:18.480 --> 1:47:25.360]  excellent. MLB has fantastic streaming and that it's so, they're so good at it that they're actually
[1:47:25.360 --> 1:47:30.160]  white labeling it for a whole bunch of, I forget how, yeah, I guess they're, they're going to do
[1:47:30.160 --> 1:47:34.800]  HBO, right? Yeah. The HBO doing, yeah, doing a whole bunch of folks. Yeah. I'm prediction. So,
[1:47:34.800 --> 1:47:40.400]  I'll make a prediction right here, which is that, and I know that HBO's like, go,
[1:47:40.400 --> 1:47:46.320]  crapped out with Game of Thrones last year. Now that they're backed by MLB, I'm going to make a
[1:47:46.320 --> 1:47:52.960]  prediction that it's going to go well, because I think the MLB stuff is really, really good.
[1:47:52.960 --> 1:47:57.520]  I, the only times I ever have problems are when I'm pretty sure that it's my Comcast connection,
[1:47:57.520 --> 1:48:04.960]  and everything in the house seems to be pretty slow. MLB, the MLB technologies group does streaming
[1:48:05.600 --> 1:48:10.560]  amazingly well. It's a really great group. So I think they're going to do well. And I think,
[1:48:10.560 --> 1:48:15.040]  I think the problem for some of those, you know, like MLB, I think you Apple would have a very
[1:48:15.040 --> 1:48:20.160]  difficult time getting MLB on board with the Apple, a new Apple TV if they couldn't use their own
[1:48:20.160 --> 1:48:24.080]  streaming. No, that's interesting. Yeah. I don't, I don't see how they would do it. I don't know. I
[1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:29.040]  think they've put such an investment into it, and they trust it so completely that,
[1:48:29.760 --> 1:48:34.240]  I think they'd have a hard time getting people to do it. And I think it's in the interest
[1:48:34.240 --> 1:48:39.040]  of these companies like Netflix and MLB to control their own streaming so that they're not tied to
[1:48:39.040 --> 1:48:44.320]  Apple's device. That to me is the difference that they're not looking to lock people in.
[1:48:44.880 --> 1:48:47.920]  The thing that struck me, another great point, the other thing that struck me about it, though,
[1:48:47.920 --> 1:48:53.040]  is that if this is it, an Apple has no, like what I guess what I would kind of hope to see Apple
[1:48:53.040 --> 1:48:57.120]  do is if you want to bring your own streaming, bring your own streaming. If you don't, there's a
[1:48:57.120 --> 1:49:01.600]  different tier and maybe Apple would obviously have to take a bigger cut of the revenue because
[1:49:01.600 --> 1:49:06.080]  they'd be providing it, but it would be interesting and neat to me if Apple had an option where
[1:49:06.080 --> 1:49:13.760]  a channel could use relay, relay on Apple, rely on Apple to provide all the backend infrastructure.
[1:49:13.760 --> 1:49:21.360]  So that truly small indie channels could exist for Apple TV, right? Like the App Store. So that
[1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:28.880]  three guys could start a, you know, Apple TV channel. And without paying, you know, an
[1:49:28.880 --> 1:49:33.760]  arm and a leg for a massive backend for streaming the video that all you need is the camera and
[1:49:33.760 --> 1:49:38.560]  a production stuff and you send the video to Apple and Apple to take care of everything else.
[1:49:38.560 --> 1:49:47.200]  Yeah, I don't think so. I mean, that's, that's I think a harder job than it, than it sounds like
[1:49:47.200 --> 1:49:51.680]  because I mean, how many three guys in the camera are you going to wow? Well, I don't know,
[1:49:51.680 --> 1:49:56.080]  is it going to be an App Store? But if it's an App Store, right? I don't think they've
[1:49:56.080 --> 1:49:59.760]  built them all in. I think, you know, I don't think it's going to be like you turn on the app,
[1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:04.640]  you know, like it is now where it's, you turn on an Apple, the new Apple TV today,
[1:50:04.640 --> 1:50:08.480]  you get all the channels. And I think there's a way you can hide the ones you don't want to see,
[1:50:08.480 --> 1:50:14.000]  but they're all there. I'm thinking of more like an App Store type thing where if you wanted to
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:20.320]  get a channel, you know, like, you've ever seen these YouTube videos, you probably have,
[1:50:20.320 --> 1:50:26.080]  because I know you're in stuff like this. There's crazy successful YouTubers who do things like,
[1:50:26.080 --> 1:50:29.760]  there's a woman who makes a huge amount of money. Nobody even knows what her name is,
[1:50:29.760 --> 1:50:39.840]  unboxing Disney toys. All she does is unbox Disney toys. I am aware, and no, I do not watch.
[1:50:39.840 --> 1:50:44.080]  No, I don't think you're, I wasn't saying that I think you're a subscriber to her channel.
[1:50:44.080 --> 1:50:49.920]  I'm saying it seems to me that you'd be aware that she exists, that she's making a terrific living,
[1:50:49.920 --> 1:51:00.000]  doing nothing but unboxing Disney toys. Yep, and kids love it. And kids love it. So I'm just saying that
[1:51:00.560 --> 1:51:07.840]  why wouldn't Apple maybe want to disrupt Google and have let her make an Apple TV channel? And it
[1:51:07.840 --> 1:51:13.520]  wouldn't show up by default. Everybody wouldn't get the woman who unboxes Disney toys channel
[1:51:13.520 --> 1:51:18.240]  on their Apple TV. But if you wanted it, you'd go to the App Store for Apple TV and get it,
[1:51:18.240 --> 1:51:22.880]  and you can put it on your homepage. And it wouldn't go through YouTube. It would just go through
[1:51:22.880 --> 1:51:28.240]  Apple. It is interesting to think about like, what will the user interface look like? Will you be
[1:51:28.240 --> 1:51:35.520]  able to, will it stay kind of like it is? And if you get the bundle that people are talking about
[1:51:35.520 --> 1:51:41.440]  Apple getting, like will you be able to only have the channels slash apps that you want to have
[1:51:41.440 --> 1:51:47.360]  on there? Or will there be a specific TV app where, and then it operates more like a traditional
[1:51:47.360 --> 1:51:53.600]  TV? I would, I mean, if you think about it, like why would Apple want to just recreate kind of a
[1:51:53.600 --> 1:51:59.440]  broken paradigm? That's interesting. Well, and it also ties back to something you mentioned like an
[1:51:59.440 --> 1:52:08.560]  hour ago, which was the with every major platform apples unveiled a new input device, you know,
[1:52:08.560 --> 1:52:15.040]  the remote, right? And again, they didn't invent the mouse, but they made the mouse mouse market.
[1:52:15.040 --> 1:52:22.240]  They didn't invent. That's, that's, that's the things. Like people, people get so hung up on on the,
[1:52:22.240 --> 1:52:30.160]  on the actual invention. And it's, it, it by all means, like invention is fantastic. But it is just
[1:52:30.160 --> 1:52:36.080]  as innovative to bring something to market in a meaningful way. And that's what Apple does. Apple
[1:52:36.080 --> 1:52:41.840]  makes markets, like they made a market for the mouse. They made a market for, for all these other
[1:52:41.840 --> 1:52:45.840]  devices. The click wheel, right? Spinning device. Well, they made the market for MP3 players and they
[1:52:45.840 --> 1:52:50.240]  made the market for smartphones. It doesn't mean they made the smartphone, but making the market
[1:52:50.240 --> 1:52:55.840]  is more meaningful. It's more profitable. And frankly, it's much more difficult. And they made the
[1:52:55.840 --> 1:53:00.320]  market for touch screens. I mean, and again, touch screens have existed for a long, long time,
[1:53:00.320 --> 1:53:04.960]  but they made the market to make it a mass market technology. No other products had a mass market
[1:53:04.960 --> 1:53:09.920]  touch screen before the idea. And, and that's where everyone benefits because then they get,
[1:53:09.920 --> 1:53:14.960]  the, the cost comes down because it, you know, get scale. So my question is, do they have something
[1:53:14.960 --> 1:53:20.240]  like that for a new Apple TV? Because the whole up, down left, right thing is not innovative.
[1:53:20.240 --> 1:53:23.920]  I wouldn't be surprised if we're still stuck with up, down left, right, select play.
[1:53:25.200 --> 1:53:30.960]  Hopefully, God, Almighty, please God, not infrared, please Bluetooth. Oh, for God, no kidding.
[1:53:31.680 --> 1:53:35.760]  Honestly, if it comes out, if they, they come out with a new Apple TV and it's an infrared remote,
[1:53:35.760 --> 1:53:41.840]  I'm, I'm, I'm good. I don't know. I don't know what I would do. I was going to say it's
[1:53:41.840 --> 1:53:46.240]  sell on my Apple stock, but I don't know any Apple stock. I'm going to buy, I would buy Apple stock
[1:53:46.240 --> 1:53:52.560]  just so I could sell it. I think they're going to sell your Apple stuff. I'm like, that seems
[1:53:52.560 --> 1:53:57.280]  a little extreme. No, I wish I owned Apple. It would make me wish I owned Apple stock so I could sell it.
[1:53:58.880 --> 1:54:03.760]  It would, it would be very upsetting. But I wouldn't be surprised if it's Bluetooth remote and
[1:54:03.760 --> 1:54:09.760]  just up, down left, right, select and play. But I would love it if they've got something, right?
[1:54:10.560 --> 1:54:13.200]  I'd love it if they have something that makes it better. So I don't know.
[1:54:13.840 --> 1:54:22.000]  I mean, so, I mean, uh, John Pizowski and then he's now at Buzzfeed, you know, said,
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:26.560]  report that there's going to be a new device and actually has an eight chip. It has a meaningful
[1:54:26.560 --> 1:54:33.440]  amount of storage for apps and an app store. Um, and he pointed out that the Apple TV, it says,
[1:54:33.440 --> 1:54:41.600]  starting at $69, which it also ends at $69 currently. Um, so you're buying the, uh, there's going
[1:54:41.600 --> 1:54:48.720]  to be multiple Apple TVs, one of which has an app store and I don't know. Maybe that's starting
[1:54:48.720 --> 1:54:52.960]  at maybe we're all reading way too much into the starting at $69 because I don't understand if
[1:54:52.960 --> 1:54:55.840]  they come out with a new one, why wouldn't the world when they just get rid of the old one,
[1:54:55.840 --> 1:54:59.440]  why would they even want to make it available if it's running an entire, you know,
[1:54:59.440 --> 1:55:05.680]  because, because the $69 point I think is important and this is a huge mistake that Microsoft made,
[1:55:06.880 --> 1:55:11.920]  Microsoft wanted the whole reason for the Xbox, the big picture strategic reason
[1:55:13.040 --> 1:55:19.520]  was that they wanted to own the living room. And the idea was we'll start with a console
[1:55:19.520 --> 1:55:24.560]  and then we'll expand into all these functions so that we own that screen. They'll have the whole
[1:55:24.560 --> 1:55:28.640]  three screens in a cloud sort of thing. The problem with that is they start in the wrong place and
[1:55:28.640 --> 1:55:33.440]  they started in a place that meant it had to be expensive. And as long as the Xbox was several
[1:55:33.440 --> 1:55:39.920]  hundred dollars, um, you know, they were never going to crack the mass market. And, and I think
[1:55:39.920 --> 1:55:47.040]  that, you know, that is, that's a cautionary tale. And I think Apple and all the other folks, Google
[1:55:47.040 --> 1:55:53.440]  and, uh, and Amazon and Roku, they're taking the better approach, which is delivering kind of
[1:55:53.440 --> 1:56:00.880]  a minimum viable product for a device and keeping the price low. And then when and if Apple
[1:56:00.880 --> 1:56:06.160]  brings this out and maybe Apple does want to come, go go up against the consoles and maybe they do
[1:56:06.160 --> 1:56:13.600]  want to like really dominate that space. Uh, to do that, you're going to, I mean, you have to spend
[1:56:13.600 --> 1:56:20.160]  some money. Uh, but you don't want, but you don't want to lose the accessibility and having the core
[1:56:20.160 --> 1:56:25.360]  function of the TV accessible to lots of people. So I, I think the multiple model approach
[1:56:25.360 --> 1:56:31.760]  actually makes a ton of sense. Yeah, maybe, maybe. Um, I do think there's a chance that they're going,
[1:56:31.760 --> 1:56:39.280]  there might be some classic, uh, Christians and style disruption potential there. Again, and I
[1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:44.720]  know I'm not a gaming expert, but I think the AA is good enough. And it's, you know, it's not going
[1:56:44.720 --> 1:56:52.320]  to render as many, you know, polygons per frame is, you know, the PS4 or the Xbox one. Um,
[1:56:52.320 --> 1:57:00.080]  but if it's only $99, it might, and it might be good enough because it, you know, in terms of how
[1:57:00.080 --> 1:57:10.160]  many pixels are on a 1080 HD screen, it's fewer than than iOS devices, the AA already handles.
[1:57:10.160 --> 1:57:15.920]  I, so I've actually argued both sides of this. Um, like I, I, I, I was all about the Apple TV and
[1:57:15.920 --> 1:57:21.840]  it's potential, um, uh, previously. And I don't know, I, I, this is why the, the, the biggest
[1:57:21.840 --> 1:57:27.600]  question to me about the new Apple TV is you were kind of hinting at it. It's, it's the input
[1:57:27.600 --> 1:57:36.800]  method. Right. Uh, I think as long as if the Apple TV does not have a controller, like a proper
[1:57:36.800 --> 1:57:43.440]  controller, uh, the traditional consoles are going to be safe. Now, their growth might be capped,
[1:57:43.440 --> 1:57:50.080]  like they're going to have trouble finding new customers, but they, they will, the current kind of
[1:57:50.080 --> 1:57:56.640]  hardcore gamers will be there. And it, it's a large enough market that the publishers will stay
[1:57:56.640 --> 1:58:01.760]  and it will still continue to be a profitable industry. The, what gets really interesting is if, if
[1:58:01.760 --> 1:58:09.200]  Apple, the, this, if there is this, this mythical higher level Apple TV, uh, and it has a proper
[1:58:09.200 --> 1:58:15.840]  controller. And I think we're talking more like $199 or $179 maybe, um, that is where, like, meaningful
[1:58:15.840 --> 1:58:22.320]  disruption becomes a possibility. Yeah. Like I think, I, I don't know, the whole disruption thing,
[1:58:22.320 --> 1:58:28.880]  I've written about this a few times, like I think the, if I have lots of, I think the, the, the,
[1:58:28.880 --> 1:58:34.960]  the core theory is, is really compelling and explains a lot of stuff. But, uh, um, you know,
[1:58:34.960 --> 1:58:40.880]  I've picked nuts with whole modular, integrated sort of stuff. But, uh, one thing is, what's
[1:58:40.880 --> 1:58:49.120]  it? One thing, one thing, one thing that bothers me about that is, it's kind of assumed with once
[1:58:49.120 --> 1:58:52.800]  the company's disrupted that it, like they're done, like they're doomed. They're going to go out
[1:58:52.800 --> 1:58:57.120]  of business. And like that's actually, like Christian said, I think what it, the way it turns out,
[1:58:57.120 --> 1:59:03.120]  though, and we've seen this play out is that a company company, and this is probably because the
[1:59:03.120 --> 1:59:08.560]  market is just so huge now, because the way it has disruption is the lower, the lower guy comes in
[1:59:08.560 --> 1:59:12.880]  and he's capturing customers that the, that the incumbent doesn't care about. And then he expands
[1:59:12.880 --> 1:59:17.440]  capture more customers and then come and retreats to the high end. And the problem is the high end
[1:59:17.440 --> 1:59:22.640]  becomes so small relative to the mass market that everyone, all the supporting players flee the
[1:59:22.640 --> 1:59:27.040]  high market and they serve the mass market and then the big, the incumbent is, is dumb, is doomed.
[1:59:27.920 --> 1:59:33.360]  The problem is the market is just so huge. Like you need, and we've talked with this with Apple
[1:59:33.360 --> 1:59:38.000]  thing, like you need to not think about things in relative terms. Apple has x percent of the market.
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:42.400]  You need to look at absolute numbers. Apple has hundreds of millions of customers, right?
[1:59:42.400 --> 1:59:46.960]  It doesn't matter if they have 10% of the market or 15% of the market. If 10% of the market is
[1:59:46.960 --> 1:59:51.200]  hundreds of millions of people, because hundreds of millions of people is plenty to support
[1:59:51.200 --> 1:59:54.880]  developers and keep them on board, all that sort of stuff. And this is the fundamental thing
[1:59:54.880 --> 2:00:00.160]  that people like Henry Bojett get wrong consistently about, about their thesis about why
[2:00:00.160 --> 2:00:05.280]  the iPhone is doomed. I think this is the case with, this is my thing,
[2:00:05.280 --> 2:00:10.720]  the thing about consoles is that as long as they're dedicated, there's so many people,
[2:00:10.720 --> 2:00:14.400]  even in a percentage of patients that's small, there's so many people that play these games,
[2:00:14.400 --> 2:00:19.680]  it will remain a space where you can build a nice business and have a nice business.
[2:00:19.680 --> 2:00:26.080]  The problem is you're just not going to grow. And I think I'm repeating myself a bit now,
[2:00:26.080 --> 2:00:31.840]  but I think I'm super excited about the Apple TV in particular, mainly because it's
[2:00:32.880 --> 2:00:37.680]  it could go in so many directions. I'll keep you focused to land the ship.
[2:00:37.680 --> 2:00:42.640]  Let me do one last sponsor and it will wrap up the show, but it's our good friends at igloo.
[2:00:42.640 --> 2:00:48.960]  Now you guys know igloo. They're the intranet that you will actually like. You can share news,
[2:00:48.960 --> 2:00:55.920]  organize files, coordinate calendars, manage projects, anything you'd want to do with a team,
[2:00:56.640 --> 2:01:02.640]  with a company, you can do on the igloo platform. They're latest upgrade. They call it Viking
[2:01:02.640 --> 2:01:07.520]  revolves around documents and how you interact with them, gather feedback and make changes.
[2:01:08.720 --> 2:01:13.760]  They've even added the ability to track who has read critical information to keep everyone
[2:01:13.760 --> 2:01:18.000]  on the same page. So if you're in a type of organization where sometimes there's a document
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:22.960]  that everybody, somebody absolutely needs to see and sign off on and get approval, you can do that
[2:01:22.960 --> 2:01:27.680]  and get proof of it like more or less like a red receipt for an iMessage or an email,
[2:01:27.680 --> 2:01:34.240]  you can get that for a document now in igloo. Very important for some, some, some organizations.
[2:01:34.240 --> 2:01:38.640]  If you've been holding off on igloo for that, now they've got it. Just like red
[2:01:38.640 --> 2:01:42.960]  receipts for email, really, but less annoying because they have a good interface for it. If you're
[2:01:42.960 --> 2:01:48.160]  a company, as a legacy internet that looks like it was built in the 90s and it probably was
[2:01:48.160 --> 2:01:55.440]  built in the 90s, you should give igloo a try. They've got all this, all sorts of other cool stuff,
[2:01:56.160 --> 2:02:01.280]  like Twitter like micro blogs, imagine having a private Twitter like service just for your team,
[2:02:02.560 --> 2:02:08.400]  totally private. Their stuff, their service, everything works on any kind of device. It's all web
[2:02:08.400 --> 2:02:14.800]  based so you can use it on big desktop machine, works great on phones, tablets, anything like that,
[2:02:15.440 --> 2:02:22.880]  and really customizable. Free to use for up to 10 people so you can try it out, find out
[2:02:22.880 --> 2:02:26.400]  everything you want to know about it before you start paying for more than 10 people to use it.
[2:02:27.440 --> 2:02:35.360]  And you can sign up at here's the website igloo software dot com slash TTS, the initials for
[2:02:35.360 --> 2:02:43.760]  the show, the talk show, igloo software dot com slash TTS. Sign up there, you get the free trial,
[2:02:43.760 --> 2:02:49.040]  use that URL with slash TTS and they'll know you came from the show. Really great, give it a try.
[2:02:49.040 --> 2:02:53.600]  It's worth going to the website. If you've never done it, just to check out the sandwich videos that
[2:02:53.600 --> 2:03:00.400]  they have to promote the site. They're really funny from our good friend Adam Lisa Gourdes company.
[2:03:00.400 --> 2:03:04.480]  So go there just to watch the sandwich videos if you haven't done it, but sign up if you have any
[2:03:04.480 --> 2:03:09.120]  kind of need for an internet for your team. Really great stuff. And I thank igloo for their
[2:03:09.120 --> 2:03:16.320]  continued support of daring fireball. What else you want to talk about them? I'm going to talk about
[2:03:16.320 --> 2:03:21.680]  basketball. Or should we talk about we maybe we see Wisconsin man final final final for
[2:03:21.680 --> 2:03:25.440]  I'm rooting for them. That's it's my team in the final for it. But that's that's not we better not
[2:03:25.440 --> 2:03:29.120]  get into that. We've got real stuff to talk about what about me. Do you want to do mere cat and
[2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:36.320]  periscope? Sure. I told my members that I was going to be writing about it like three weeks ago and
[2:03:36.320 --> 2:03:39.920]  I still haven't written. I wrote a couple of pieces about basically I said that, you know,
[2:03:40.720 --> 2:03:46.800]  mere cat is almost certainly doomed. Would you call this the the the coincidental rise of the two
[2:03:46.800 --> 2:03:51.040]  another one of those things like you mentioned before, like just in the history of science,
[2:03:51.040 --> 2:03:56.960]  you know, like going all the way back to Newton and Leibniz with calculus being, you know, developed
[2:03:56.960 --> 2:04:02.000]  pretty much simultaneously separately by the two geniuses. Is this another one of those things where
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  like mere cat and periscope more or less arrived at the same time? It's just like everything was
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:12.800]  in the right. Everything got to the right place at the right time? No, absolutely. I mean, the idea of
[2:04:12.800 --> 2:04:17.360]  live streaming is in a new one. And there's there are services that are out there and that I've
[2:04:17.360 --> 2:04:21.760]  had some success. Like you now I think is actually has is a lot better than people realize.
[2:04:21.760 --> 2:04:27.440]  Um, but the idea, the having the connectivity everywhere, we're having LTE everywhere. Like it gets
[2:04:27.440 --> 2:04:31.920]  really dodgy on 3G. So you need to you need to eat. You need the quality cameras. You need
[2:04:32.560 --> 2:04:39.120]  the app store. You need the Twitter, you know, the Twitter graph. You also need, I think you need
[2:04:39.120 --> 2:04:47.680]  data packages that with sufficient gigabytes per month that people feel comfortable consuming and
[2:04:47.680 --> 2:04:55.040]  sharing, uh, the video streaming video content like this, which is, it's, it's part of your LTE,
[2:04:55.040 --> 2:04:59.760]  but, you know, LTE and itself isn't enough. If it's not affordable enough that people feel
[2:04:59.760 --> 2:05:04.640]  like they can just sit there and watch people, you know, making these videos. Right. Exactly.
[2:05:04.640 --> 2:05:09.920]  Exactly. And so no, I think it's a, it's a great example of the time was right for this product
[2:05:09.920 --> 2:05:15.120]  to emerge. And it just so happened like to emerge within like two weeks of each other.
[2:05:15.120 --> 2:05:20.800]  I described it as a, like a science fiction scenario. And there was some pushback from people
[2:05:20.800 --> 2:05:25.520]  like that. Like, oh, come on, live streaming isn't new. It's not new. So, you know, what is science
[2:05:25.520 --> 2:05:34.320]  fiction about this? To me, the part that science fiction is the, uh, uh, universality that the way
[2:05:34.320 --> 2:05:37.760]  that anybody can do it. You don't, you don't, you don't, it's all free. You don't pay for anything
[2:05:37.760 --> 2:05:41.440]  other than what you've already paid for, which is your iPhone and your data panel plan.
[2:05:41.440 --> 2:05:49.600]  Which to me, it's the size. It's like, it's, it's this, this 4.5 inch device that is doing this.
[2:05:50.240 --> 2:05:55.680]  But yeah, the, the, the sort of equipment that was needed to do just video, much less,
[2:05:56.320 --> 2:06:01.680]  like, yeah, you could live stream 20 years ago. You needed a big ass camera. You needed like a
[2:06:01.680 --> 2:06:06.240]  microwave connection. You needed a van with a massive satellite dish on top of it. Like,
[2:06:06.240 --> 2:06:10.400]  you're, you're doing exactly that with a piece of glass in your hand.
[2:06:10.400 --> 2:06:14.080]  I think the thing, and I think the thing that is the most science fictiony in terms of if you
[2:06:14.080 --> 2:06:23.040]  went back 20 years and described periscoping to somebody 20 years ago or let alone longer. But the
[2:06:23.040 --> 2:06:31.840]  most amazing aspect of it to me is that the device for producing and the device for consuming is
[2:06:31.840 --> 2:06:40.480]  exact and the app, it's the same app and device for being a producer as a consumer. You use your iPhone
[2:06:40.480 --> 2:06:48.960]  with periscope or meerkat to create a stream or to consume it. And that to me is the magic. And
[2:06:48.960 --> 2:06:52.800]  it's so easy to overlook because it seems so obvious when you see it in action. But that's
[2:06:52.800 --> 2:07:00.560]  revolutionary that the right like your TV set is not a TV studio. It is anything, but it doesn't
[2:07:00.560 --> 2:07:04.640]  even have it, you know, it's just unrelated. Right. Because this gives much more the sense of it
[2:07:04.640 --> 2:07:10.880]  being like a portal. Right. It's like you're, you're in one side and out the other. Whereas,
[2:07:10.880 --> 2:07:16.000]  whereas pretty this last year, it's a one, it's, it's unidirectional. Like, it's coming from the
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:21.600]  studio to your TV. Yeah. There wasn't the sense, even if, even if a mere microscope is one way,
[2:07:21.600 --> 2:07:26.800]  the, it's, the container is such that it's a bidirectional relationship.
[2:07:26.800 --> 2:07:33.680]  It is crazy to me. I think it's so exciting and funny that it's the same device for somebody,
[2:07:33.680 --> 2:07:40.240]  you know, like somebody with 10,000 followers, you know, 10, 20, 30,000 followers who gets
[2:07:40.240 --> 2:07:44.960]  hundreds and hundreds, maybe a thousand people watching their streams. They're using an iPhone
[2:07:44.960 --> 2:07:50.000]  with periscope to send that and all the people watching it are using an iPhone with periscope
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:55.760]  to watch it. It's exact same device and the exact same app. Yeah. I mean, it's, it, it really,
[2:07:55.760 --> 2:08:02.800]  like I, I haven't like, I'm with you. I mean, the first, so I really, um, I, I was at the Apple,
[2:08:02.800 --> 2:08:08.320]  the, the watch event, um, the second one that you missed. March night. Yeah. And I started,
[2:08:08.320 --> 2:08:12.000]  and that was when I really started using it, was I was using it in line, saying outside,
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:17.360]  like before the event started, I saw you, I saw you on the stream. I saw you standing up,
[2:08:17.360 --> 2:08:21.440]  you had a seat. I think you're in the third row. And I saw you standing up on your phone,
[2:08:21.440 --> 2:08:24.960]  and I said, I text you as like, you're on the stream and you're on your phone and you're like,
[2:08:24.960 --> 2:08:30.640]  I'm your cutting. Yeah. And it was, it was mind blowing. Like you look up there and you see you had
[2:08:30.640 --> 2:08:36.720]  like 350 people, you know, like watching you, like there are 300 people, like all over the world.
[2:08:36.720 --> 2:08:40.320]  I mean, you, you, you write a website, right? It's already amazing. You can look at your analytics,
[2:08:40.320 --> 2:08:45.680]  and you see like someone lying on from like Brazil or Russia or, you know, wherever it may be.
[2:08:45.680 --> 2:08:51.040]  And like that's already mind blowing enough, but the immediacy of knowing like someone is sitting
[2:08:51.040 --> 2:08:59.360]  somewhere 6,000 miles away from me. And they are seeing exactly what I'm seeing. And because
[2:08:59.360 --> 2:09:05.040]  I am holding up this device, like it, it's, it's, it's an incredible, it's an incredible experience.
[2:09:05.040 --> 2:09:09.280]  The truth is though, I, I'm with you. I think Mirkat is fucked. And I think it was obvious.
[2:09:09.280 --> 2:09:14.320]  I think it was obviously even before Periscope came out just from, and I'm not an expert on
[2:09:14.320 --> 2:09:18.960]  social media. I, you know, I mean, I'm the nerd and I follow this stuff. But I thought it,
[2:09:18.960 --> 2:09:22.960]  and I, but Mirkat caught my attention. I was like, oh, this is something. And I see this. But then
[2:09:22.960 --> 2:09:28.640]  Twitter immediately got word out that they had purchased, because it here to before Mirkat came out,
[2:09:28.640 --> 2:09:34.640]  the fact that Twitter had bought Periscope was not in public knowledge. Right. They bought
[2:09:34.640 --> 2:09:38.480]  Periscope. And I don't know if it's on the record or if it's just rumored, but for $100 million,
[2:09:38.480 --> 2:09:45.680]  which if it's true, I think was rivals, I think it's going to end up rivaling Facebook's
[2:09:45.680 --> 2:09:50.720]  purchase of Instagram for $1 billion as one of the great acquisitions of this decade.
[2:09:51.280 --> 2:09:56.560]  I really do. Absolutely. I think if they got Periscope for $100 million, that's going to go down
[2:09:56.560 --> 2:10:03.840]  as a great acquisition and exhibit A in the case that Decostello is actually a pretty good CEO,
[2:10:04.480 --> 2:10:09.600]  I think. No, I agree. The reason, the reason why Mirkat is screwed is because
[2:10:09.600 --> 2:10:18.480]  what is so pout like what one thing about Twitter is Twitter is so many things to so many
[2:10:18.480 --> 2:10:22.320]  different people in so many different scenarios. Right. Like that's what makes it so great.
[2:10:22.320 --> 2:10:28.400]  And so makes it so hard to use for a new user in particular. But for sure, one of the core
[2:10:29.280 --> 2:10:33.760]  values of Twitter is real time. Right. When something happens, you go to Twitter,
[2:10:33.760 --> 2:10:37.200]  you can search, you can get the reaction. We talked about it just a second ago with watching a
[2:10:37.200 --> 2:10:40.960]  game and how annoying it is when Twitter is like five seconds ahead. Right. And that's how real
[2:10:40.960 --> 2:10:46.240]  time it is. Like Twitter is faster than my stream of the game and it's frustrating. Like and
[2:10:47.440 --> 2:10:53.200]  but and so both Mirkat and Twitter are and the reason why Mirkat was a
[2:10:53.200 --> 2:10:57.760]  Througia Twitter and why it's a good thing they had acquired Periscope was that it was
[2:10:57.760 --> 2:11:04.400]  unbundling one of the core features of Twitter because real time in text is one thing.
[2:11:04.400 --> 2:11:11.040]  But real time in video is is another thing entirely in a dramatically more powerful way. So you
[2:11:11.040 --> 2:11:16.480]  have someone tweeting about like a fire going on or the plane crash. Like I was tweeting when
[2:11:16.480 --> 2:11:21.600]  the plane crash happened in Taiwan a few weeks ago. Or that built the gas explosion in New York
[2:11:21.600 --> 2:11:26.400]  last week. Right. Yeah. No, exactly. Which happened to be like the day Mayor Periscope came out.
[2:11:26.400 --> 2:11:36.240]  So so so helpful that has a that that is like that has to be Twitter because Twitter has Twitter
[2:11:36.240 --> 2:11:42.160]  has to own that. Yeah. And that's why Mirkat is screwed because because there there is so
[2:11:42.160 --> 2:11:47.680]  fundamentally tied to what Twitter is like Twitter already owns the real time space. Which means
[2:11:47.680 --> 2:11:52.400]  all the people that you want to find or follow in real time are already on Twitter. Which means
[2:11:52.400 --> 2:11:58.480]  you have to have access to the Twitter graph to and and they now don't. So for anybody and I know
[2:11:58.480 --> 2:12:01.920]  Periscope and there's it just seems like the writing's already on what we don't even need to
[2:12:01.920 --> 2:12:07.760]  analyze. Analyze it because parent. Mirkat is really dropped precipitously in the App Store rankings
[2:12:07.760 --> 2:12:16.320]  and Periscope is at the top and Apple is promoting it heavily. And I think you can't beat the
[2:12:16.320 --> 2:12:23.040]  first party integration with Twitter. Right. No matter even if Mirkat had been allowed to keep the
[2:12:23.040 --> 2:12:28.800]  access to the social graph that they had and that Twitter pulled a couple weeks ago. Even if they
[2:12:28.800 --> 2:12:33.520]  kept that it wouldn't help them because it's not being a third party thing built on top of
[2:12:33.520 --> 2:12:38.480]  Twitter is never going to be as integrated as a first party thing within Twitter. Second of all
[2:12:38.480 --> 2:12:43.680]  the technology is clearly better on Periscope side. Just technologically it is much closer to live.
[2:12:43.680 --> 2:12:49.600]  And for anybody out there who hasn't used either of these apps. The basic just you should get
[2:12:49.600 --> 2:12:54.000]  Periscope in my opinion. I think you could probably skip Mirkat at this point but get Periscope,
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:58.640]  get your username. I think it's really interesting. I'm about to. I've still got notifications on.
[2:12:58.640 --> 2:13:02.720]  I'm probably going to turn that off soon because it's starting to do that. They just announced
[2:13:02.720 --> 2:13:08.640]  they did a post yesterday saying that. Oops. Sorry. We over who we which in this annoys me like you could
[2:13:08.640 --> 2:13:15.360]  tell from Mirkat the way notifications needed to be and they still shipped it wrong. That worries me
[2:13:15.360 --> 2:13:20.800]  but like yeah because the problem is notifications are essential though because like that's how you
[2:13:20.800 --> 2:13:24.960]  like following it on Twitter you're always late. You have to get the notification and that's how
[2:13:24.960 --> 2:13:32.160]  you catch the live stream. Obviously Periscope has it keeps the streams around for a period of time
[2:13:32.160 --> 2:13:35.840]  but if you want to be alive it's so you don't want to turn it off at the same time the way it's
[2:13:35.840 --> 2:13:39.840]  implemented now it's overwhelming. I'm going to I'm going to start Periscope being me talking to
[2:13:39.840 --> 2:13:48.160]  you right now so it will be very metal. That would be great. That would be great. I've thought
[2:13:48.160 --> 2:13:52.720]  about people keep asking me am I going to start Periscope and while I broadcast the show I don't
[2:13:52.720 --> 2:13:57.360]  think so because I don't see how I could get the audio from both sides through and also I don't
[2:13:59.680 --> 2:14:04.960]  I don't know if I want to be on camera but I maybe do it briefly. I'm talking. I'm probably
[2:14:04.960 --> 2:14:11.120]  I'm like wearing like whatever. I was actually temporarily like number four or number five on the
[2:14:11.120 --> 2:14:18.240]  Mircatt leaderboard. I saw that. But but then I saw well talking about Periscope on the
[2:14:18.960 --> 2:14:28.160]  talk show with Gruber so meta and I'm going to post it to Twitter. If you haven't used it
[2:14:28.160 --> 2:14:33.760]  starting the broadcast. The gist of it is is that you you know you get a one-way the producer's video
[2:14:33.760 --> 2:14:38.080]  is there and you hear them you see them you see them either see them or you see what they're seeing
[2:14:38.080 --> 2:14:43.120]  if they have the camera pointed around the other way. Here it goes 2026 people 28 people 29 people
[2:14:43.120 --> 2:14:47.840]  32 people and they can come back people and then you can see their comments. Now they can't
[2:14:47.840 --> 2:14:52.320]  you know it's obviously not audio because it would be a mess. Oh man John the the hearts are
[2:14:52.320 --> 2:14:57.440]  flowing in people are people are pleased with our people are pleased with our stream.
[2:14:57.440 --> 2:15:06.560]  That's but the latency on Mircatt was at least 30 seconds on the comments in my experience.
[2:15:06.560 --> 2:15:11.200]  I'm not as a somebody broadcasting but watching and it really made for a slightly awkward experience
[2:15:11.200 --> 2:15:16.080]  where if the person who was on if it was like a Q&A type thing like hey ask me anything about what
[2:15:16.080 --> 2:15:21.120]  you you know. Yeah I did I did that and it's yeah I didn't realize that the lag was so bad and
[2:15:21.120 --> 2:15:24.880]  they're like oh no that's the question right walk off and then like I go on Twitter and there was
[2:15:24.880 --> 2:15:29.600]  like five gazillion questions there. Right and it's way behind where as periscope it seems like
[2:15:29.600 --> 2:15:34.880]  it's really minimal it's seconds behind and you see a question and if it's a good question you see
[2:15:34.880 --> 2:15:39.440]  the person who's you know hosting the video. We'll test it we'll test it right now. Can someone type
[2:15:39.440 --> 2:15:49.120]  in the comments type John? Someone's asking how's oh yeah everyone. Okay stop stop that's enough.
[2:15:49.120 --> 2:15:54.640]  John John John John John John John John John. People want to know how your eye is.
[2:15:54.640 --> 2:16:00.000]  It's steady as she goes I mean it's not. This is very awkward when people listen to the five
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:05.280]  guests. It's going to be it's going to be totally out of place. Yeah I'm enough. People do want to
[2:16:05.280 --> 2:16:12.240]  know. It's you know according to the doctors it's as good as could be hoped at this point
[2:16:12.960 --> 2:16:17.360]  my vision is not good out of the eye but it's you know better than being blind.
[2:16:17.360 --> 2:16:23.920]  Long story short but it's not I'm not expected there's no expectation that that my vision will be
[2:16:24.880 --> 2:16:31.920]  that it's as good as it will be yet it's you know should take months before it settles in.
[2:16:31.920 --> 2:16:35.920]  And I still have the gas still have the gas bubble in there so it's still relatively
[2:16:37.200 --> 2:16:42.480]  it's you know impossible to judge. Are you going to be able to go to WDC or? Oh yeah definitely.
[2:16:42.480 --> 2:16:50.240]  Well I can't say definitely but it's supposed to be 6 to 10 weeks for the gas bubble to fully dissolve
[2:16:50.240 --> 2:16:58.880]  and it was February 24 so four weeks was March 24 so now it's five weeks. So it should be
[2:16:58.880 --> 2:17:03.360]  sometime within the month of April. I don't think I can't book travel there's no way I would book a
[2:17:03.360 --> 2:17:09.440]  flight in April. I think by May I should be good and by the end of May for sure because that's way
[2:17:09.440 --> 2:17:15.760]  past 10 weeks and it's definitely shrinking so that's you know. But I have to I need to go there
[2:17:15.760 --> 2:17:19.840]  and they need to look in my eye and verify that the gas bubble is completely gone before I can
[2:17:19.840 --> 2:17:24.560]  get on an airplane. I can't just like that's the wise that's a wise course of action. Yeah although
[2:17:24.560 --> 2:17:29.840]  I think that if it was there but truly tiny like the last day or two I could do it because you
[2:17:29.840 --> 2:17:33.200]  know the whole thing is that you go on if you if I went on the airplane and the air pressure
[2:17:33.200 --> 2:17:38.160]  change the gas bubble would greatly increase in size but if it was tiny even if it greatly
[2:17:38.160 --> 2:17:42.720]  increases in size it would make a difference. The issue is if it's of any reasonable size it would
[2:17:42.720 --> 2:17:47.920]  increase big enough that it would you know be it's. Did I say this on the show? I read a book
[2:17:47.920 --> 2:17:54.080]  about it. I read like an actual I found like through Google an actual textbook for retinal
[2:17:54.080 --> 2:17:58.000]  surgeons it was you know like a medical textbook that Google had indexed so I read about this
[2:17:58.000 --> 2:18:05.120]  procedure that I had and it goes into great detail about this restriction that things you need
[2:18:05.120 --> 2:18:09.040]  to do after this is you need to emphasize to your patient that you cannot get on an airplane
[2:18:09.040 --> 2:18:12.880]  until you have permission till it's gone and it goes into all this detail about how it would be
[2:18:12.880 --> 2:18:17.600]  excruciatingly painful if you if you did this and it's all this stuff about how much pain you would
[2:18:17.600 --> 2:18:23.200]  be in and then just one sentence at the end is that it would also likely render them blind permanently
[2:18:23.200 --> 2:18:28.160]  blind and I'm like the pain would be bad it would be terrible to be in pain for a flight but it's
[2:18:28.880 --> 2:18:33.520]  it's the permanent blindness that to me is a better selling point on hey take this serious.
[2:18:33.520 --> 2:18:39.360]  You're right exactly I don't I mean I I fortunately haven't had anything I although I was worn
[2:18:39.360 --> 2:18:45.280]  the last time I saw the ad doctor like they told me all the symptoms of a retinal terror because
[2:18:45.280 --> 2:18:51.200]  they're because I'm apparently at risk so now you have me super paranoid but I once took a flight
[2:18:51.200 --> 2:18:55.120]  where I didn't even know before I got in the flight apparently had something in my sinuses
[2:18:55.120 --> 2:19:03.840]  um and it was excruciating like I was like I at one point I like the flight attendants
[2:19:03.840 --> 2:19:08.560]  but finally let me lay on the floor in the back of the plane like I was I was it was unbelievable
[2:19:09.920 --> 2:19:16.160]  and then the plane descended I was totally fine yeah um yeah man so I can imagine that being in my eye
[2:19:16.160 --> 2:19:22.080]  it sounds pretty crappy right um so so the interesting thing about about uh uh periscope
[2:19:22.080 --> 2:19:28.240]  a meerkat is um we had totally said stream by me filming sorry about that uh this is a good
[2:19:28.240 --> 2:19:36.480]  example to not uh to not livestream your show um but I think it really highlights what is
[2:19:37.520 --> 2:19:43.760]  what is valuable about twitter the company and what's interesting is I'm not sure that the most
[2:19:43.760 --> 2:19:49.200]  valuable part of twitter is like the twitter app like the actual looking comments and stuff like
[2:19:49.200 --> 2:19:54.480]  that what's valuable about twitter what makes twitter unique and what makes twitter um potentially
[2:19:54.480 --> 2:20:00.000]  super valuable when it comes to advertising is it's the twitter graph and because the twitter
[2:20:00.000 --> 2:20:06.000]  graph is what I'm interested in right Facebook it's who I know uh google it's what I'm searching
[2:20:06.000 --> 2:20:10.960]  for Pinterest is interesting it's kind of like what I aspire to but twitter like it's what I'm
[2:20:10.960 --> 2:20:14.720]  interested in the people that I follow the things that I searched for the folks interact with you
[2:20:14.720 --> 2:20:19.360]  you can really if you want to if an advertisement wants to understand Ben Thompson like he just needs
[2:20:19.360 --> 2:20:24.720]  to understand my twitter account and he will know me better than any other service will know me
[2:20:25.440 --> 2:20:32.480]  and what's interesting about that is the key then for twitter is is getting people to have a
[2:20:32.480 --> 2:20:39.040]  twitter account and to kind of build up that profile and and they got and what's funny is like they
[2:20:39.040 --> 2:20:45.120]  belatedly have the pieces and and so the twitter app is interesting in a way that it helps
[2:20:45.120 --> 2:20:49.840]  understand me I'm not sure it's the best place to monetize it monetize is pretty well
[2:20:49.840 --> 2:20:54.480]  but I think that's where they acquired um what's going to be they acquired a company that what's
[2:20:54.480 --> 2:21:01.920]  them put put ads in other apps and stuff like that um crap it's escaping me uh but I think that
[2:21:01.920 --> 2:21:11.440]  that's really compelling to imagine a twitter ad network that is fueled by uh by knowing what
[2:21:11.440 --> 2:21:17.760]  I'm interested in and then the ideally you would have lots of apps that the key to twitter is not
[2:21:17.760 --> 2:21:23.680]  twitter the app but it's twitter the login and so imagine a world where you had lots of apps
[2:21:23.680 --> 2:21:28.320]  that use the twitter credential use the twitter login so you could have both mere cat and periscope
[2:21:28.320 --> 2:21:32.160]  and they would not be a part of twitter they would fight it out they would both log in with twitter
[2:21:32.160 --> 2:21:36.080]  and they would necessarily like on the twitter because if you that's the graph that matters for a
[2:21:36.080 --> 2:21:43.120]  live app um and then twitter can monetize through their ad network like it's this alternative
[2:21:43.120 --> 2:21:48.400]  vision for twitter that they kind of went away from back in the day when they shut off all the
[2:21:48.400 --> 2:21:52.880]  third party clients and they decided no we're going to own our platform and we're going to be an
[2:21:52.880 --> 2:22:01.040]  ad displaying platform um it's it's it's like a what if like twitter back in 2012 when they
[2:22:01.040 --> 2:22:06.160]  walked out all the twitter clients they made the decision that we are going to monetize by
[2:22:06.160 --> 2:22:13.600]  showing ads on the twitter app and I think in retrospect that might have been or it was probably
[2:22:13.600 --> 2:22:19.920]  a suboptimal decision because what was valuable was not the app it was the identity and and in
[2:22:19.920 --> 2:22:24.560]  some respects twitter the app is like a minimum viable product of what you can do with someone's
[2:22:24.560 --> 2:22:29.680]  identity but if I if you know what someone's interested in like you can build stuff like periscope
[2:22:29.680 --> 2:22:33.840]  you can build stuff like like in your cake and build stuff like the twitter app you can build
[2:22:33.840 --> 2:22:40.080]  all kinds of of interesting stuff and it's it's too bad that didn't happen um and like twitter
[2:22:40.080 --> 2:22:46.000]  now kind of had to buy periscope yeah I started a periscope here I just saw that in twitter yeah
[2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:52.080]  yeah and everybody wants uh I want to be to talk but I couldn't cuz it's your cuz Ben was going on
[2:22:52.080 --> 2:22:59.440]  that's why uh that is why I wasn't talking uh how many people are we up to here 394 holy shit
[2:22:59.440 --> 2:23:03.520]  I don't know about these hearts I think the hearts thing is I don't know people seem to love it but
[2:23:03.520 --> 2:23:06.960]  I think it's I don't know I think it's weird and I don't understand how they how you how do you know
[2:23:06.960 --> 2:23:10.400]  when you're sending hearts it's like you hold your finger down and no you just touch the screen
[2:23:10.400 --> 2:23:15.360]  you touch the screen and how do you know which ones are yours though you don't yeah and what's the
[2:23:15.360 --> 2:23:20.160]  I don't understand the point of it I don't understand it you don't feel you don't feel loved and
[2:23:20.160 --> 2:23:31.760]  appreciated no I don't know I feel like I feel like uh seeing 495 people on makes me feel
[2:23:31.760 --> 2:23:37.760]  appreciated or or something but uh I don't know the hearts I don't get yeah and that's the other
[2:23:37.760 --> 2:23:45.520]  thing that's interesting is um is the is people are saying that everybody gets a color but I've got 563
[2:23:45.520 --> 2:23:53.520]  people here there are not 563 colors right and how do I know who's who I don't know um well the other
[2:23:53.520 --> 2:23:59.120]  the other thing the the one oh somebody got brown hearts and they're very upset about it I think
[2:23:59.120 --> 2:24:03.120]  that's like the reservoir dogs be happy about it it's like the reservoir dykes thing with uh
[2:24:03.120 --> 2:24:11.360]  Quentin Tarantino didn't want to be Mr. Brown that's like Mr. Shit um there is an aspect of
[2:24:11.360 --> 2:24:15.040]  Paris it's the main issue to see how it plays out because right now it certainly benefits I mean you
[2:24:15.040 --> 2:24:22.080]  and I you have um what you know 200,000 followers 300,000 followers I have 20,000 or something like
[2:24:22.080 --> 2:24:27.280]  that and so we immediately have like an audience when we launched Paris don't find it up getting
[2:24:27.280 --> 2:24:33.440]  like 350 when when when I was just doing it um what will be interesting and you can see with
[2:24:33.440 --> 2:24:40.000]  the disaster thing or celebrities using it for sure um what's interesting about that is I think
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:44.880]  the most interesting part is is gain the people to log on to watch that I'm very interested to see
[2:24:45.920 --> 2:24:52.080]  what use this ends up having for a kind of normal people like people who have 50 followers or
[2:24:52.080 --> 2:24:58.640]  100 followers like what ends up being compelling for them um if anything or maybe it's going to
[2:24:58.640 --> 2:25:04.480]  be there's going to be observers and watchers for the most part so this is so meta so the people
[2:25:04.480 --> 2:25:10.880]  who are watching on periscope uh don't hear your side and you're the whole point that Ben just
[2:25:10.880 --> 2:25:15.520]  made that only I can hear here in my headphones is that it's going to be interesting to see
[2:25:15.520 --> 2:25:22.720]  what the what the use case for this really is is that fair that's a fair sorry and I do
[2:25:22.720 --> 2:25:26.720]  especially for normal people with a lot of followers even though there's what there's a 1300
[2:25:26.720 --> 2:25:33.280]  people watching right now I do think that the answer to that is not going to be watching one side
[2:25:33.280 --> 2:25:40.000]  of a podcast I think if I could somehow patch through your audio this would be interesting um
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:48.240]  um you know because some people do like listening along to live episodes of shows but um yeah one
[2:25:48.240 --> 2:25:53.200]  side is definitely not enough so hello to everybody out there but I'm going to I'm going to end
[2:25:53.200 --> 2:25:59.840]  this because I don't think this is very compelling all right I'll swipe down to stop all right
[2:25:59.840 --> 2:26:04.240]  audio everybody thank you maybe I'll do more of these later what's what's what's what's what's
[2:26:04.240 --> 2:26:07.760]  unfortunate is it was probably it's rough to watch these only here one side it's going to be
[2:26:07.760 --> 2:26:12.320]  really rough to listen to because we're going to just be kind of stumbling all over the place
[2:26:12.320 --> 2:26:16.560]  I probably have to delete this it's probably because it probably uh has uh
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:23.920]  oh wake up I doesn't there some kind of thing where the location is on by default
[2:26:25.440 --> 2:26:31.280]  yeah I think I probably uh oh I I don't know I think I have mine disabled I don't know if I
[2:26:31.280 --> 2:26:38.080]  did or not how do I know I have no idea let me see or let me look at my parasol see if your streams
[2:26:38.080 --> 2:26:46.480]  there did you just oh maybe not though because it seems like no it seems like location sharing
[2:26:46.480 --> 2:26:51.760]  was off I just yeah I think it was off I heard some maybe that was me or cat I don't know
[2:26:51.760 --> 2:26:57.600]  or maybe they changed it in an update to the app but I didn't do anything I forgot I forgot to
[2:26:57.600 --> 2:27:02.480]  even check but now that I try to do a new broadcast the location indicator defaults to off so I
[2:27:02.480 --> 2:27:08.000]  think it's actually pretty good I wouldn't mind if if there was a setting that let you do it and
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:14.800]  it was uh just broad like it just told you what city I was in I don't know yeah that that was
[2:27:14.800 --> 2:27:19.200]  another update this is they're gonna do is they're making making the location less exact yeah maybe
[2:27:19.200 --> 2:27:23.040]  I don't know but anyway I don't know do you see my thing I don't see where it even went how do I
[2:27:23.040 --> 2:27:31.360]  access my my videos well anyway this doesn't make for a good show but um I'll check it out after
[2:27:31.360 --> 2:27:37.360]  the show what else anything else you want to talk about uh no we're we're two and a half hours
[2:27:37.360 --> 2:27:41.840]  they've been in the last I think the last 30 minutes got pretty chaffees yeah no that's probably
[2:27:41.840 --> 2:27:46.800]  pretty that's a good way to end it all right who do you like an NCAA tournament uh well
[2:27:46.800 --> 2:27:52.240]  with my heart or with my head well give me both picks well obviously Wisconsin for both all right
[2:27:52.240 --> 2:27:57.440]  uh no I mean I would Kentucky it's did you go to university in Wisconsin yes I did wow
[2:27:57.440 --> 2:28:01.120]  so it's not just that you're I knew you you were there I didn't know if you were if you were just
[2:28:01.120 --> 2:28:05.840]  local or if you actually went to the school well that's terribly exciting yes and so uh do you
[2:28:05.840 --> 2:28:10.480]  like their chances I think I think we have a decent chance I mean I think the great thing about
[2:28:10.480 --> 2:28:15.520]  this team is um one I mean they made a last year so I mean and they watched Kentucky on a last
[2:28:15.520 --> 2:28:24.240]  second shot um so uh like this team doesn't get frazzled like they they just like Arizona like
[2:28:24.240 --> 2:28:28.320]  punched him in the mouth in the first half of that game last week and it looked really bad but
[2:28:29.360 --> 2:28:32.160]  it's one of those teams you watch them and you're never worried because you know they're
[2:28:32.160 --> 2:28:38.800]  gonna like get it together and they're gonna respond and um I think that's that's a good thing
[2:28:38.800 --> 2:28:44.080]  going against you know this undefeated juggernaut super team that they're not going to be intimidated
[2:28:44.080 --> 2:28:48.240]  right and they have a couple guys that are real matchup problems I think I think Kaminsky the
[2:28:48.240 --> 2:28:52.320]  you know player of the year which makes me the year probably national player of the year
[2:28:52.320 --> 2:28:58.800]  I think he's going to struggle frankly um the Colley Stein uh on Kentucky is is probably a perfect
[2:28:58.800 --> 2:29:05.520]  matchup for him um but I think you know decker at the small forward spot uh definitely has the
[2:29:05.520 --> 2:29:10.560]  potential to be a matchup issue and yeah I think if anything can be Kentucky is Wisconsin I think
[2:29:10.560 --> 2:29:14.080]  Kentucky should be favored but I like your chances yeah what's the spread do you have you looked at
[2:29:14.080 --> 2:29:20.800]  the spread uh I haven't so uh I thought last week's that weekend was an absolutely great weekend
[2:29:20.800 --> 2:29:26.160]  of college basketball and there's so many crazy tight games but almost everyone came down to which
[2:29:26.160 --> 2:29:34.400]  to to me which team kept their shit together down the stretch yep um I mean pork and zaga I was
[2:29:34.400 --> 2:29:38.160]  rooting from I hate Duke so I was rooting for Gonzaga but they didn't score a point in the last
[2:29:38.160 --> 2:29:42.400]  six and a half minutes which is atrocious you know I mean that's I mean how can you win a basketball
[2:29:42.400 --> 2:29:46.080]  game a tight basketball game where you don't score in the last six minutes I mean you know
[2:29:46.080 --> 2:29:51.440]  all Duke plays good defense but man that was bad and they took some bad shots um and I thought
[2:29:51.440 --> 2:29:58.880]  with Louisville who played um wait who did Lucian state yeah Michigan state uh oh my god the guys on
[2:29:58.880 --> 2:30:05.840]  the foul line look like they were ready to die and and it was like the clang of the ball hitting
[2:30:05.840 --> 2:30:11.440]  the hoop it was like ear splitting I mean it was right and it hard Notre Dame then too yeah
[2:30:11.440 --> 2:30:16.480]  another I mean just like slicing them apart and then the last the last two minutes just like
[2:30:16.480 --> 2:30:20.960]  degenerating into pounding the ball at the top of the key um yeah there was a guy I forget is
[2:30:20.960 --> 2:30:25.520]  I don't remember their names but there was a guy with like uh in the last minute and Louisville
[2:30:25.520 --> 2:30:30.640]  was still in it and a guard came down and they had all the time in the world down by one and a
[2:30:30.640 --> 2:30:36.160]  guard forced up a bad shot and I thought Rick Patino was I thought he was going to have an
[2:30:36.160 --> 2:30:42.000]  aneurysm it was like he he put up a shot that was like you won't if you've only got six seconds
[2:30:42.000 --> 2:30:46.240]  to go you know coast to coast all right you know it wasn't maybe he could have gotten a better
[2:30:46.240 --> 2:30:51.200]  shot but you can't blame him you only had six shot six seconds this was like 40 seconds to go
[2:30:51.200 --> 2:30:56.160]  and or maybe a minute or so you know but it was it was outside the you know you couldn't run the
[2:30:56.160 --> 2:31:00.640]  shot clock all the way down but you had all the time you needed to get a good shot and run and play
[2:31:00.640 --> 2:31:05.040]  and this guy came down and just forced up a shot and it you know it's to me as I get telltale
[2:31:05.040 --> 2:31:11.360]  sign of a team that cracked under pressure yeah no for sure so I don't think I think I think you're
[2:31:11.360 --> 2:31:15.680]  right I like Wisconsin's chances I mean let's face it Kentucky's the best team and I think that
[2:31:15.680 --> 2:31:20.400]  you know it they're gonna be tough to beat but I think Wisconsin can do it because I've got the size
[2:31:20.960 --> 2:31:25.840]  my hope is that we either see and I hate to say this because God Almighty I hate to
[2:31:25.840 --> 2:31:31.040]  but I feel like the two most interesting final matchups would be the all big 10 matchup of Michigan
[2:31:31.040 --> 2:31:36.480]  State versus Wisconsin or one of the most underrated like rivalries in the country like it's
[2:31:36.480 --> 2:31:42.400]  it's pretty intense and has been for 10 15 years now and and you know what a what a feather
[2:31:42.400 --> 2:31:48.960]  and a cap to the big 10 or Kentucky versus Duke and I hate I don't like either Kentucky or Duke
[2:31:48.960 --> 2:31:52.880]  but I mean let's face it that probably you know they're they're two you know top tier you know
[2:31:52.880 --> 2:31:56.960]  that would be the killer those would be the two killer championships to me
[2:31:56.960 --> 2:32:01.840]  but anyway Wisconsin Duke and Wisconsin Duke did play this year actually Duke won but it was a
[2:32:01.840 --> 2:32:06.960]  great game so it wouldn't be a bad consolation prize by the way the Kentucky opened as a six point
[2:32:06.960 --> 2:32:11.600]  favorite but it's moved to five hmm so they're five point favorites yeah right well anyway I'll
[2:32:11.600 --> 2:32:16.640]  be rooting for Wisconsin I love the underdog and either was yeah I could I would root for either
[2:32:16.640 --> 2:32:19.760]  Wisconsin or Michigan State anybody but Duke or Kentucky for God's sake
