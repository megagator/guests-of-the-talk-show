[00:00.000 --> 00:07.280]  Rene Ritchie. John Gruber. From iMore. How long was your iOS 8 review? 21,000 words. What?
[00:09.680 --> 00:15.840]  Holy shit. Yeah, 200 pictures. I need to be put down. 21,000 words. You know,
[00:16.640 --> 00:24.400]  and I mean this sincerely, not just because you're the guest on the show, but for years I've been
[00:24.400 --> 00:32.080]  thinking, man, wouldn't it be great if somebody wrote iOS reviews each year the way John Siracusa
[00:32.080 --> 00:37.840]  does Mac OS X reviews? And I realized that you do. Like, they're all there. They're there all
[00:37.840 --> 00:44.080]  the way back to iOS 2. And there are, you know, it was just called like iPhone OS 2 or something
[00:44.080 --> 00:52.240]  like that. And they are book length. 21,000 words. Seriously, that's more closer to a book than an
[00:52.240 --> 00:56.560]  article. I just, I always feel this need to explain things as if, you know, because Apple
[00:56.560 --> 01:01.840]  gives us WWDC sessions and they give us keynotes, but the keynotes are fast and the WWDC sessions
[01:01.840 --> 01:06.560]  are super geeky. And I just picture my mom or my dad really wanting to find out what's going on and
[01:06.560 --> 01:13.120]  trying to write that for them. That's true. I don't know. And it's, you know, Apple's,
[01:14.720 --> 01:21.200]  these OS updates are getting, well, they've always been deep, but like iOS 7 to iOS 8, there is so
[01:21.200 --> 01:26.640]  much. And from a marketing perspective, Apple really just can't cover it in detail.
[01:26.640 --> 01:34.880]  They can't publish 21,000 words about it, you know, and it's like they're moving so
[01:34.880 --> 01:40.400]  effectively year over year that it's, it is, I think it's truly a challenge to keep up.
[01:41.120 --> 01:45.520]  You know, I take the Siracusa thing as a huge compliment. I can't say that I'm anywhere nearly
[01:45.520 --> 01:52.240]  as competent as he is to write these things, but I think that's exactly it. They are so,
[01:52.240 --> 01:56.480]  especially something like extensibility and how it works in the container apps and the host
[01:56.480 --> 02:03.040]  apps and how the security and privacy is handled are really complicated topics. And I watch those
[02:03.040 --> 02:06.800]  sessions four or five times each because I want to understand them better. And the writing process
[02:06.800 --> 02:12.720]  is sort of me digesting and figuring out what it all means. Yeah, I almost mean it the other way.
[02:12.720 --> 02:17.040]  I do mean it as a compliment. I mean it as a profound compliment, but I almost worry that
[02:17.040 --> 02:21.920]  the way that I pose it, that I say, Hey, it took me years to realize this, that we already had
[02:21.920 --> 02:26.640]  somebody doing it and it's you. I almost worried that that comes across as an insult because I say
[02:26.640 --> 02:31.440]  it took me years to realize it. And I think, and I don't mean it as an insult in any way,
[02:31.440 --> 02:35.360]  but I do think that maybe the reason it didn't dawn on me right away is that
[02:35.360 --> 02:44.960]  your style is so much more understated. It is a very, you know, you personally are almost out of
[02:44.960 --> 02:52.320]  the picture and it's a, I know that this word in terms of journalism is grossly overused,
[02:52.320 --> 03:00.560]  but it's a much more objective viewpoint. And with SirQsa, he's always there, right? It is,
[03:00.560 --> 03:11.840]  it's Mac OS X reviews very specifically from his perspective and as it pertains to his obsessions.
[03:11.840 --> 03:17.040]  Well, he's got an amazing authorial voice. I mean, you can, he talks the way that he writes,
[03:17.040 --> 03:23.600]  and you just, you always know it's exactly John. And I have my biases. I try to state my biases
[03:23.600 --> 03:29.840]  upfront and own them. But I think there's just so much to cover that I have to get out of my
[03:29.840 --> 03:35.120]  own way when I do it. Yeah, I totally agree. So a lot of writing and it puts, it's good because
[03:35.120 --> 03:38.880]  this way I can have someone on the show who wrote more than I did this week. Yeah, those,
[03:38.880 --> 03:44.080]  especially the watch piece and the iPhone review, those are amazing. Yeah. Oh, thank you. Thank you.
[03:44.080 --> 03:49.520]  It was both. And I, you know, I really did, but write them both in one waking day from like
[03:50.320 --> 03:56.560]  around one in the afternoon until 6am. Just one after another. I had been, I had notes all over
[03:56.560 --> 04:01.600]  the place from, you know, the eight days prior. I mean, it's certainly like, I didn't, I didn't
[04:01.600 --> 04:06.960]  start writing in a vacuum, but I just, all I had were notes and wrote them both. And I think they
[04:06.960 --> 04:12.800]  were both like a little over 4,000 words. So like 8,000 words in one working day, which is
[04:14.400 --> 04:18.640]  needless to say unusual. I like the watch one, especially because we've had people who cover
[04:18.640 --> 04:23.040]  smartwatches write about them. And we've had people like from Hodaki who do cover watches
[04:23.040 --> 04:28.000]  write about them. But you made a really salient point in your piece that these two cultures are
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.240]  going to clash in the middle. And you poked some fun at my friend, Phil Nickenson yesterday. And
[04:32.240 --> 04:37.440]  rightly so, because he was saying that, you know, the $70 watch band was a hefty price
[04:37.440 --> 04:41.840]  and people have no idea what's coming when these two industries emerge, I think. You see, I put a,
[04:41.840 --> 04:46.400]  I posted a clarification on that today. And, and the point, cause I think it was, I could,
[04:46.400 --> 04:56.000]  I think it was misinterpreted where I'm not cheerleading or clapping or, or smugly sitting
[04:56.000 --> 05:01.760]  with my arms folded about the idea of multi-thousand dollar Apple watches. I'm just
[05:01.760 --> 05:04.960]  saying, I think that that's what's coming, whether you like it or not, whether you have a strong
[05:04.960 --> 05:08.000]  opinion on it or not, whether you think that's cool, whether you think it's ridiculous or
[05:08.000 --> 05:14.960]  preposterous. But I do think, and again, like something like a band that costs $500,
[05:14.960 --> 05:19.440]  if you think that's hefty, I would, I would agree. That's, that's, you know, I don't think,
[05:19.440 --> 05:25.440]  no matter what your income of three, four or $500 band, just the band is, you know, hefty,
[05:25.440 --> 05:32.240]  hefty is a decent word for that. And, you know, it's like, in my research for the watch piece,
[05:32.240 --> 05:37.280]  I was looking at things like, what does it cost to get like an actual Rolex stainless steel,
[05:37.280 --> 05:42.320]  not no precious metals, but stainless steel replacement band. And they, they sell for at
[05:42.320 --> 05:46.240]  least $2,500. Because I think the ones you can find online are sort of gray market.
[05:48.160 --> 05:52.720]  Because, you know, authorized dealers for Rolex and other brands like that don't advertise prices.
[05:52.720 --> 05:59.360]  But let's just say that's in the ballpark. If you want to think that that's exorbitant,
[06:00.080 --> 06:06.800]  I see exactly what you mean. I may not necessarily agree. But I can totally see the reason of
[06:06.800 --> 06:10.400]  somebody that I could say that's a reasonable position to take that nobody should buy a watch
[06:10.400 --> 06:15.280]  that the band alone costs $2,500. Totally reasonable. It's, I don't necessarily agree,
[06:15.280 --> 06:22.080]  but it's reasonable. But $80? $80 is right there smack in the middle of the mainstream watch market.
[06:22.080 --> 06:26.400]  You know, that's absolutely true. I have another friend, Kevin, and he collects watches. He has six
[06:26.400 --> 06:31.760]  or seven. He has the Omegas and Panerais and Rolexes and other brands whose names escape me.
[06:31.760 --> 06:36.320]  But when he first heard about the Apple Watch, he loves technology. And he said, though, he was not
[06:36.320 --> 06:40.320]  going to buy one unless they had one that was in the thousands of dollars because it wasn't the
[06:40.320 --> 06:44.720]  kind of watch that he was interested in. And now when he read your piece specifically, he said that
[06:44.720 --> 06:49.520]  it made him even more inclined to buy it. And he's, frankly, the more expensive they get, the
[06:49.520 --> 06:55.680]  more appealing that is to him as someone who loves watches. Yeah. Well, anyway, we're only a couple
[06:55.680 --> 07:02.240]  minutes in, but it's impossible for us in one show, even by the ever-growing length of episodes
[07:02.240 --> 07:06.560]  of this show, there's no way that we can talk about everything. And I think the watch is
[07:06.560 --> 07:13.680]  unfortunately going to meet the cutting floor because the phones are new. I've had them for a
[07:13.680 --> 07:21.280]  week. iOS 8 is out and is new and you have covered it. I think it's fair to say more extensively than
[07:21.280 --> 07:27.360]  anybody else. Maybe Federico would only be the only other person I could think of whose depth
[07:27.360 --> 07:33.440]  of coverage of iOS 8 is in the same ballpark. And I think we'll be lucky to... I don't think we'll
[07:33.440 --> 07:38.720]  be lucky to finish on time even with just those two things. And we could talk about the event
[07:38.720 --> 07:46.960]  itself, which I didn't really cover and I usually like to do. And maybe that's where we can start.
[07:48.160 --> 07:53.200]  Got a bunch of sponsors to run through, though. So let me, you know, let's take a break before
[07:53.200 --> 07:58.960]  we even get started talking about the event. And let me tell you guys about our first sponsor. It's
[07:58.960 --> 08:03.680]  our good friends at Harry's. This is one of the sponsors. They've been with the show for a while
[08:03.680 --> 08:10.480]  now. They keep doing it. If you haven't tried these guys yet, you're nuts. So what does Harry's
[08:10.480 --> 08:17.600]  do? Harry's is a company that looked at the men's shaving market, every aspect of it from
[08:17.600 --> 08:25.920]  the hardware, the blades and the razors and shaving cream and stuff like that. You know,
[08:25.920 --> 08:30.960]  the hardware, the products just looked at the whole thing and said, this market is ripe for
[08:30.960 --> 08:36.720]  disruption. You're not getting... You're paying too much and getting an inferior product. I was
[08:36.720 --> 08:42.720]  on Electric Shadow today and Moises described, you know, the stuff you get from Gillette as looking
[08:42.720 --> 08:48.160]  like a, I forget what he said, something like a cross between a disco and a Hot Wheels car. Just
[08:48.160 --> 08:54.480]  bad industrial design and cheap. Harry's stuff, their razors, their handles are so nice. And they
[08:54.480 --> 09:00.880]  just look like something that's built to last quality-wise and built to last design-wise,
[09:00.880 --> 09:05.280]  just in terms of like, you could buy one in 10 or 15 years from now. It's still going to look nice.
[09:05.280 --> 09:10.560]  It's just right. It doesn't look like it's from this decade or that decade, just quality design.
[09:10.560 --> 09:18.480]  And they're disrupting the pricing because they're giving you higher quality stuff at lower prices.
[09:19.040 --> 09:25.120]  The starter sets an amazing deal. For 15 bucks, you get a razor moisturizing shave cream and three
[09:25.120 --> 09:31.040]  razor blades. Why pay 32 bucks for an eight pack of blades when it's half the price at Harry's?
[09:31.760 --> 09:36.640]  And the big thing too, I think it's important, is that they're not just slapping a name, you know,
[09:36.640 --> 09:40.560]  and they do have a cool name, cool brand, they ship stuff in cool boxes, but they're not just
[09:40.560 --> 09:45.520]  slapping their name Harry's on blades made by others. They're so serious about controlling the
[09:45.520 --> 09:50.640]  whole thing, the whole widget, is that they purchased their own razor blade factory in Germany
[09:50.640 --> 09:59.120]  and they're producing their own high quality, high performing German razor blades. It's just great.
[09:59.120 --> 10:04.560]  It's great stuff. I can't be, can't say enough good things about, about their product. So where

[10:19.120 --> 10:24.240]  whatever your first order is. And like I said, their starter kit is, it's just 15 bucks. So I
[10:24.240 --> 10:28.640]  mean, you can, you know, it's practically like getting started for free. So check out harrys.com
[10:28.640 --> 10:36.080]  and I guarantee you're going to be happy with it. All right, so the event in the Flint Center,
[10:37.200 --> 10:42.480]  big mystery white box out front for a while. You were there, I think you were sitting two seats
[10:42.480 --> 10:46.160]  down from me, right? Or were you next to me? No, I think it was me, Clayton, you and Jim.
[10:47.120 --> 10:56.400]  Right, me, you, Clayton Morris and Jim Dalrymple. Now getting invited to these sort of events,
[10:56.400 --> 11:00.400]  now that's, how many times have you been to like a keynote with a press badge? Twice,
[11:00.400 --> 11:06.480]  this is my second. And the first one was WWDC. So that, you know, it's, you know,
[11:07.440 --> 11:13.200]  I hesitate to say new Apple, but it is a, an evolved Apple, I would say. New implies like
[11:13.200 --> 11:18.720]  a change in direction. I would say it's more of an expansion of a direction they were already in.
[11:18.720 --> 11:22.960]  Yeah, no, I think that's absolutely fair. It's, it's sort of like some of the constraints have
[11:22.960 --> 11:28.800]  fallen away from them. Yeah, and they're, you know, openness is indeed the right word. Now,
[11:28.800 --> 11:35.600]  I compare this all the way back to the original iPhone 2007. The original iPhone 2007 review units
[11:35.600 --> 11:41.440]  were only given to, I think, four people. I think it was Ed Begg at USA Today, Pogue at the Times,
[11:41.440 --> 11:48.640]  Mossberg then at the Journal, and Steven Levy at Newsweek. That was it. They were the only four
[11:48.640 --> 11:55.680]  people on the entire planet who got a review unit of the original iPhone. And I would say,
[11:55.680 --> 12:02.320]  even for a few years after that, the people who were on the list of, you'll get pre, you know,
[12:02.320 --> 12:06.880]  a review unit a week or two weeks before it actually comes out, was limited to
[12:09.280 --> 12:14.160]  established, long established print periodicals, even if most people nowadays,
[12:14.160 --> 12:20.560]  even those days, were reading them online. And then slowly, they started adding people from
[12:20.560 --> 12:28.320]  online only publications, you know, the Engadgets and people like me and Dalrymple and stuff like
[12:28.320 --> 12:37.200]  that. Yeah, and on. And it's, you know, so that's why I say and clearly what they've done is they
[12:37.200 --> 12:42.480]  have greatly expanded the list of members of the press who are getting invited to these events.
[12:42.480 --> 12:48.080]  It's no longer, I still say, I think it's still selective. I can't even imagine how many requests
[12:48.080 --> 12:52.800]  they get that they turn down. But I think it's opened up in a way, and I think in a right way,
[12:52.800 --> 12:56.960]  where it's people who should have been, I think it's, you know, long overdue that you've been,
[12:56.960 --> 13:06.880]  you've gotten invited to stuff like this. Daniel Dilger from Apple Insider has, I think, maybe,
[13:06.880 --> 13:10.080]  I don't know if WWDC was the first, but it's, you know, certainly within the last year that
[13:10.080 --> 13:16.960]  he started getting called well too. Yep, Serenity. Well, Serenity Macworld has gotten invitations for
[13:16.960 --> 13:21.360]  a long time. Yeah, but it's, I'm never sure with Apple, whether it's the publication or the
[13:21.360 --> 13:28.160]  journalist that they're inviting. It's both is my feeling. I don't think, I think it's sort of
[13:28.160 --> 13:34.000]  the equivalent of asking whether Apple is a hardware software company. You know, it's both
[13:34.000 --> 13:40.960]  because like, for example, MG Siegler, when he was full-time at TechCrunch, was getting invited.
[13:41.760 --> 13:47.680]  And then when he left TechCrunch, but before he joined Google, he still got invited, even when
[13:47.680 --> 13:50.560]  he wasn't a full-time person at TechCrunch. Ryan Block too, when he left Engadget.
[13:51.360 --> 13:54.480]  Yeah, he's another good example. Yeah, perfect example.
[13:58.640 --> 14:03.600]  It's clearly though, and I can't help, we talked, a bunch of us, because we had like an hour to burn
[14:03.600 --> 14:08.000]  before the event milling about. I mean, it was, you know, what, and that's what we do. We sit
[14:08.000 --> 14:13.600]  there and insider gossip, but it's, it's almost impossible not to draw a conclusion that it has
[14:13.600 --> 14:18.880]  something, you know, that this expansion of the list and less exclusivity has something to do
[14:18.880 --> 14:23.760]  with Katie Cotton's departure. It was also a much bigger venue than they've used for iPhone events
[14:23.760 --> 14:28.160]  in the past. And often, you know, at least, you know, they would cite capacity issues, but they
[14:28.160 --> 14:34.320]  made sure they had room for 2,000 odd people, including fashion bloggers. And you introduced me
[14:34.880 --> 14:37.360]  to the gentleman from Hodeke, the watch bloggers were there too.
[14:38.160 --> 14:44.080]  Right. Yeah, you know, I didn't know Ben Clymer personally, but even though I've been a fan of
[14:44.080 --> 14:50.320]  his site for a very long time, but I actually thought about introducing myself to him in
[14:50.320 --> 14:54.480]  advance, just sending an email. I don't, you know, I don't even know if I could assume that he's,
[14:54.480 --> 14:57.680]  you know, familiar with Daring Fireball, but maybe, but even if not, I would, you know,
[14:57.680 --> 15:02.160]  take the point that just saying what I do, and just saying, Hey, did you get an invitation to
[15:02.160 --> 15:06.320]  this event? Because I thought that would have been, you know, a surefire tell that they were
[15:06.320 --> 15:11.680]  going to do a watch. I can't help but think to the fact that guy and maybe he couldn't say maybe
[15:11.680 --> 15:15.840]  he got an invitation that said he can't talk about it. But I think the fact that that Ben
[15:15.840 --> 15:23.520]  Clymer was there and presumably other people from the watch world is why the fact that they were
[15:23.520 --> 15:29.520]  going to do a watch leaked within about the last week. Sure. Because even just a month prior,
[15:30.080 --> 15:35.440]  when I suggested that maybe they would do the wearable at the September event,
[15:35.440 --> 15:39.760]  even though all the previous rumors said it would be an October thing. And it was like a big deal
[15:39.760 --> 15:44.800]  for a day that I'd said that everybody was expecting October. Right. And then all of a
[15:44.800 --> 15:47.600]  sudden, about a week before it was like, Oh, yeah, they're definitely going to do a watch.
[15:48.400 --> 15:50.640]  I can't help but think it's because they started inviting people.
[15:50.640 --> 15:54.400]  Yeah, well, I mean, that that joke comment that you made was
[15:55.360 --> 15:59.040]  terrific. I mean, that that propagated incredibly quickly across the internet.
[16:00.000 --> 16:05.200]  Yeah, well, it really was, though, wasn't just that anybody told it to me, it was honestly just
[16:05.200 --> 16:10.400]  the hunch that it would make sense as a single event, you know, here's this thing where you
[16:10.400 --> 16:15.680]  can do touch ID on your phone, here's this thing, you know, to pay. Because I knew the payments
[16:15.680 --> 16:19.680]  thing was coming. And it just seemed like, well, why not do it with the watch? And same thing with
[16:19.680 --> 16:25.600]  all the health tracking. Sure. Whereas I don't see how the watch would fit with an iPad and Yosemite
[16:25.600 --> 16:29.760]  event in October. Yeah, if it's going to be a companion product, specifically for the iPhone,
[16:29.760 --> 16:34.000]  then it makes sense to do in the iPhone event. Yeah, and that's the other thing, too. I didn't
[16:34.000 --> 16:39.120]  see that I didn't know, you know, nobody knew in advance that it was going to be a Hey, you need
[16:39.120 --> 16:44.960]  you need an iPhone to fully use the Apple Watch. Right, you know, they've said to use it period.
[16:44.960 --> 16:49.760]  Even though a lot of its functionality is not dependent on have being within proximity to the
[16:49.760 --> 16:56.880]  phone. But yeah, that makes sense, too. And it's not surprising. No, and it was it was a really
[16:56.880 --> 17:00.400]  strange morning, because you and I, and I think we were standing with Jason Snell and a couple
[17:00.400 --> 17:05.280]  other people. And we noticed that Apple was quasi live blogging their own event, which I've never
[17:05.280 --> 17:10.560]  seen before. Yeah, that's totally new, you know, and I, you know, I've always thought that, like
[17:10.560 --> 17:14.000]  you said, with the capacity that they cite, you know, well, we have it here, because we can't
[17:14.000 --> 17:20.880]  find a bigger place. I don't recall and Jason snow, we were talking about this, and Snell seems
[17:20.880 --> 17:26.080]  to think that they might have done this at some point, but I can't recall them ever using Moscone
[17:26.080 --> 17:34.080]  West other than as a keynote from Mac World Expo or WWDC, when when, you know, Moscone has already
[17:34.080 --> 17:40.880]  been rented out, that they've never, and I think, you know, and he said, he thinks maybe they have,
[17:40.880 --> 17:46.080]  but it's hard, because if somebody else, like in last week, for example, Intel had a developers
[17:46.080 --> 17:50.480]  conference at Moscone West, so they couldn't have had, they literally could not have done it, but I
[17:50.480 --> 17:56.160]  don't think they've ever done that. And that's a huge room, potentially. Other than that, they I've
[17:56.160 --> 18:00.720]  in all the years I've been going to these things, I've never seen one that was in an event, a venue
[18:00.720 --> 18:04.240]  as large as the Flint Center. And it's historic for Apple, too, because they made a point of pointing
[18:04.240 --> 18:12.080]  out, this is where the Mac and the iMac are introduced. Right. The biggest surprise to me,
[18:12.080 --> 18:19.760]  and a sign that Apple PR has, you know, truly evolved and changed was that Brian Lamb was
[18:19.760 --> 18:26.160]  invited. Yeah. Now at the great, great wire cutter site. And I think it's great that he did.
[18:26.160 --> 18:31.040]  But the reason that's remarkable is that he's the guy who was running Gizmodo back when they
[18:31.040 --> 18:38.640]  had their hands on the stolen iPhone from the bar where the Apple engineer had left it.
[18:38.640 --> 18:42.880]  And he's the guy who answered the phone when Steve Jobs personally called and said,
[18:42.880 --> 18:47.840]  give me back my phone and said no, you know, we want something from you before we give it back to you.
[18:48.560 --> 18:54.560]  The fact that he's now off the shit list and on the invitation list is remarkable. I even with
[18:54.560 --> 18:59.520]  all of the expansion of it, even with the return of Gizmodo, because everybody who was there back
[18:59.520 --> 19:04.800]  then has gone from Gizmodo now. They've, you know, the Gawker sites go through, you know, employees,
[19:04.800 --> 19:11.760]  you know, like butter churning. Yeah. Even if you believe the penalty box has expired on Gizmodo,
[19:11.760 --> 19:15.280]  you're never quite sure if the ban on that specific player has been lifted.
[19:15.280 --> 19:19.280]  Exactly. You know, and I think it's right. I think, you know, forgive and forget, you know,
[19:19.280 --> 19:24.560]  Brian Lamb is doing very different work and much better work these days. And why not? But I just
[19:24.560 --> 19:28.480]  no way I cannot believe that that would have happened if Katie was still there. Oh, again,
[19:28.480 --> 19:33.600]  it feels sort of like a huge constraint that had been on them has been lifted. And they can do a
[19:33.600 --> 19:36.880]  lot of the things that they probably thought would have been cool and fun a long time ago,
[19:36.880 --> 19:40.800]  like the countdown timer on apple.com. Yeah, totally. Yeah. And the live blog. Yes.
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.760]  I half suspected Anand would pull out a computer and start live logging it right from the floor
[19:45.760 --> 19:50.640]  with us. Did you see him? No, he wasn't there apparently. Oh, I didn't know that. I looked
[19:50.640 --> 19:55.520]  around for him, but it was so many people that I'm surprised I found as many people friends that I
[19:55.520 --> 20:02.320]  knew. Before the event as I did, it was so crazy. I took a panoramic picture. And a couple people
[20:02.320 --> 20:08.000]  comment and I twittered it and a couple people said it looks like like one of the Disney World
[20:08.000 --> 20:12.480]  theme parks in the morning before they opened the gates, you know, and when thousands of people
[20:12.480 --> 20:18.400]  show up to try to be, you know, get on the rides first. And it really did. It's some people were
[20:18.400 --> 20:22.880]  saying and apples a little cagey. I think about stuff like this is like how many people actually
[20:22.880 --> 20:27.280]  were there. I don't think they don't like to answer stuff like that. But somebody said that
[20:27.280 --> 20:32.240]  they had a capacity twice that of your baboina. I don't see how that's possible, though. It has
[20:32.240 --> 20:37.120]  to be more than twice, I think because I've been to your baboina events many times and have never
[20:37.120 --> 20:42.480]  seen half that many people there. I've you know, it seems like a third or even fewer.
[20:42.480 --> 20:47.440]  Someone mentioned it sees between 2000 and 2400. And I saw later some people that I know some
[20:47.440 --> 20:51.520]  friends that were there. And they tweeted that they were there. And I did not see them at all
[20:51.520 --> 20:57.520]  throughout the entire course of the event. There's so many. Yeah. The other thing that I thought too
[20:57.520 --> 21:02.560]  is there were a lot more Apple people there too, even with this expansion in the list of press who
[21:02.560 --> 21:08.160]  were there to cover it, which is definitely true. They invited way more Apple people to be there.
[21:08.160 --> 21:12.240]  Like when at the end when Tim Cook said, Hey, everybody who's from Apple, please do me a favor
[21:12.240 --> 21:17.200]  stand up right now. See my half the crowd stood up. Yeah, apparently they had an internal lottery
[21:17.200 --> 21:20.640]  and some of the departments because they couldn't get everybody so you'd get a chance to go and a
[21:20.640 --> 21:25.840]  bunch of people got picked. It was really nice to see. So, you know, after you know, it's almost
[21:25.840 --> 21:31.040]  a week and a half now as we record this. Looking back on how do you what do you what are your
[21:31.040 --> 21:35.760]  thoughts on the event as a whole? I think the event I have sort of two trains of thought about
[21:35.760 --> 21:40.720]  it. One is that I think the stuff itself was really, really interesting. The stuff they showed
[21:40.720 --> 21:45.680]  off the iPhones. It was similar to when they finally went from AT&T to Verizon, they finally
[21:45.680 --> 21:49.760]  went from a four inch to larger iPhones. And you can argue whether they should have done that
[21:49.760 --> 21:55.600]  earlier. I think they had really good timing. But also it wasn't quite like the iPad or the iPhone
[21:55.600 --> 22:00.080]  event. And I think specifically the iPad event because Steve Jobs was so careful to say,
[22:00.080 --> 22:05.280]  this is your phone. This is your laptop. This is the tablet. And this is what it does better than
[22:05.280 --> 22:09.680]  both those things. And this is the reason it has to exist. And with the iPhone, it was you know,
[22:09.680 --> 22:13.360]  these are the old keyboards. And this is why they're wrong and the old input methods and
[22:13.360 --> 22:20.320]  technologies and why they're wrong. And for the phones and the watch, we got a list of really
[22:20.320 --> 22:25.920]  amazing features. But there was never that one moment where Tim Cook or anybody at Apple said,
[22:25.920 --> 22:31.760]  this is this is the reason this has to exist. For the iPhone 6. Yeah, or the iPhone 6 or the
[22:31.760 --> 22:36.720]  iWatch. I mean, I think it was clear like we can extrapolate it. Like the iWatch is clearly
[22:36.720 --> 22:41.840]  convenience and the iPhone 6 is clearly a higher class of software eventually. But it was never
[22:41.840 --> 22:46.400]  stated outright on a single slide or in a single sort of slogan. I think for two very different
[22:46.400 --> 22:54.880]  reasons, though. I think with the iPhones, it's they're not hard for anybody who's used an iPhone
[22:54.880 --> 23:02.640]  to get their heads around. The screen is either bigger or way bigger. And the camera's better.
[23:02.640 --> 23:07.920]  And they get better battery life. And they're thinner and sleeker. And right, you could pretty
[23:07.920 --> 23:15.680]  much stop right there. I, you know, it's, you know, I don't think I wasted any words in my
[23:15.680 --> 23:22.640]  review. But I think that a very short overview can get across 85% of what most people would want to
[23:22.640 --> 23:27.520]  know about these phones, right? The iPhone 6 is bigger, it gets a little bit better battery life,
[23:27.520 --> 23:33.200]  the screen as is nicely improved, you know, in terms of viewing angles and color and stuff like
[23:33.200 --> 23:39.120]  that. And the camera's better. And that's it, you know, and you can you can get it in higher storage
[23:39.120 --> 23:45.920]  capacities. And then the iPhone 6 Plus. It's way bigger. If you want like a new style device,
[23:45.920 --> 23:51.440]  that's that's like a two handed iPhone size, more like a mini tablet. And you're going to get a
[23:51.440 --> 23:57.680]  couple more hours of battery life per day because the battery is so humongous. There's the you know,
[23:57.680 --> 24:02.480]  there's a new class iPhone for you and stop right there. And I think that covers what it what it
[24:02.480 --> 24:07.600]  means for 85% of the people. Yeah, I agree completely. I think my only reservation is that
[24:07.600 --> 24:13.040]  you're never sure. We all live in bubbles of various sizes. And I have a Nexus five and I
[24:13.040 --> 24:18.880]  have a Lumia 1020. And I have I've used Galaxy Notes and Galaxy Megas and things like that the
[24:18.880 --> 24:22.640]  big phones, so I'm a little bit familiar with them. But I think a lot of people who've only
[24:22.640 --> 24:28.560]  bought iPhones are only familiar with the 3.5 and four inch size. And to hear why Apple didn't
[24:28.560 --> 24:34.880]  continue that like why they went to the bigger screen. I think, you know, there's a productivity
[24:34.880 --> 24:40.800]  argument to be made for the iPhone 6 Plus. But even the iPhone six, there's a there's a really
[24:40.800 --> 24:45.120]  brief statement about we're going to give you more we're going to give you a bigger window window
[24:45.120 --> 24:49.280]  into the internet and into apps. It would have just eased a little bit of the stress that people
[24:49.280 --> 24:52.640]  had when Oh, my, you know, instead of saying, Oh, my God, the abandoned the four inch would be,
[24:52.640 --> 24:58.080]  Oh, wow, this is so much more that I can do now with 4.7. Yeah, and I've been thinking about that,
[24:58.080 --> 25:04.320]  you know, maybe even close to a year ever since it became so strongly rumored that they were going to
[25:04.320 --> 25:14.560]  go to two sizes 4.7 and 5.5 and not have a next generation model at the foreign side size. I've
[25:14.560 --> 25:20.160]  been thinking for a long time, you know, the whole the whole year. Well, I like 4.0 inches and
[25:20.160 --> 25:27.760]  4.0 inches is the size of the most best selling the best selling
[25:27.760 --> 25:33.280]  most profitable phone in the world. Because that's what the iPhone five s was. Yeah,
[25:33.280 --> 25:37.920]  you know, and the iPhone five c was like, I don't know, like third like the third best selling and
[25:37.920 --> 25:45.680]  most profitable smartphone in the world, like three, two out of the top three selling phones
[25:45.680 --> 25:50.640]  in the world were 4.0 inches last year. And they've now they've just left. And you know,
[25:50.640 --> 25:54.320]  when I asked about this, and one of the things I was told was, well, we haven't left her behind,
[25:54.320 --> 25:58.640]  we still have those phones, they're just moved down the line, and including the fact that you
[25:58.640 --> 26:07.360]  can buy the new five s at 32 gigabytes, not just at 16 for $49 more $249 on contract.
[26:08.560 --> 26:13.920]  And that's not entirely new either, because the five c, when it was as a brand new device last
[26:13.920 --> 26:20.800]  year, it came in 16 and 32 gigabyte sizes, too. But I feel like that's a little bit more of a,
[26:20.800 --> 26:25.520]  it just seems to me like a little bit more of a hedge. Now, yeah, it's an escape hatch,
[26:25.520 --> 26:29.520]  if you're not quite ready to grow with Apple to the largest screen sizes yet. Right. So I don't
[26:29.520 --> 26:35.600]  know, I wonder if they're going to wait and look at what people buy and what how things go or what
[26:35.600 --> 26:41.600]  they're thinking like it wouldn't totally I would expect that next year, we're just going to get s.
[26:41.600 --> 26:47.520]  I don't know if they'll use an S, but the equivalent iPhone six s and iPhone six s plus,
[26:47.520 --> 26:55.600]  and the two new phones will be these sizes. I don't expect there to be you know them to go back
[26:55.600 --> 27:01.360]  to 4.0 inches. It sounds to me like they've said here's the at this point with the technology
[27:01.360 --> 27:06.400]  where technologies evolved, where prices have evolved on screens, what's the best sweet spot
[27:06.400 --> 27:12.000]  to hit the most people with the least amount of choice? These are the two sizes they've decided
[27:12.000 --> 27:17.920]  on, I think, but I wouldn't be shocked if they, you know, have a 4.0, you know, call it the
[27:18.560 --> 27:26.320]  iPhone six mini. Yeah. You know, and it's this rounded form factor, but at a four inch size.
[27:26.320 --> 27:31.360]  It wouldn't shock me, but I don't expect it. No, and I think it's interesting. And you had
[27:31.360 --> 27:37.280]  a good post before the event on what you thought the screen sizes would be and why. And it reminded
[27:37.280 --> 27:42.240]  me the first time I read it of when Steve Jobs was talking about the difference between the iPad and
[27:42.240 --> 27:47.760]  Android tablets when they were just basically expanding the interface. And he was saying that
[27:47.760 --> 27:52.320]  with the iPad and the split view controller, it allowed a higher class of software. And when I saw
[27:52.320 --> 27:57.200]  the five, sorry, this iPhone six plus turned sideways and you get that split view controller,
[27:57.200 --> 28:02.080]  it reminded me of the same thing. These bigger sizes, the Apple's only doing it with the iPhone
[28:02.080 --> 28:06.480]  six plus, but developers can do it with any size that they want now with the new adaptive UI,
[28:06.480 --> 28:11.680]  that it will allow for a higher class of software, but that sort of necessitates a larger screen,
[28:11.680 --> 28:17.440]  especially for anybody who doesn't have really good, really young eyes. Yeah. Well, I don't
[28:17.440 --> 28:23.120]  think there's no way that that split view would work on the 4.0 in size. They show it in one,
[28:23.120 --> 28:29.360]  in that WWDC session in a demo app. And it does look, but it's that 16.9 aspect ratio that is
[28:29.360 --> 28:33.920]  wasteful in some interfaces on the iPhone in landscape mode. And the split screen just seems
[28:33.920 --> 28:39.760]  to fix that one problem. Yeah. Especially with the keyboard up because there's a minimum height
[28:39.760 --> 28:45.680]  to a usable keyboard. And on the 4.0 in size, when you're, when you're horizontal, it's at least half
[28:45.680 --> 28:51.520]  the screen. Whereas on the two new phones, it's not, you know, it leaves a lot more room above
[28:51.520 --> 28:55.920]  it because they don't, that the keyboard isn't the same relative size. It's more like the same
[28:55.920 --> 29:01.360]  physical height. Yeah. And it is that compromise that I think, you know, you spoke about earlier
[29:01.360 --> 29:06.640]  where it, it is bigger to carry around, but the iPhone six plus specifically, you turn it around
[29:06.640 --> 29:11.840]  and get that iPad style layout. You are gaining productivity out of that compromise. Yeah. I'm
[29:11.840 --> 29:18.640]  looking at the six plus in my hands right now. And with the keyboard up in landscape mode,
[29:18.640 --> 29:24.080]  horizontal mode, it's a little bit more than a third, but it's way less than a half. There's
[29:24.080 --> 29:29.920]  way more usable, you know, screen real estate above the keyboard on this. Yeah. The iPhone
[29:29.920 --> 29:35.280]  five and five S made me really claustrophobic with the keyboard up in landscape mode. Yeah. I,
[29:35.280 --> 29:40.320]  you know, and that might be the main reason why I say I never use my iPhone in landscape other than
[29:40.320 --> 29:44.880]  what things where, you know, like videos or watching videos or playing games. Likewise.
[29:44.880 --> 29:51.200]  The only thing I ever, ever do in landscape is sometimes with a webpage that doesn't really,
[29:51.200 --> 29:55.920]  even with double tap to zoom, the text is too small. I'll turn it sideways to be able to read
[29:55.920 --> 30:02.080]  it and that's it. I can't think of anything else that I do in landscape. No, I'm the exactly the
[30:02.080 --> 30:08.640]  same way, which is why that, that 16.9 aspect ratio is so good for those few specific things,
[30:08.640 --> 30:13.440]  but the other portrait is much better for the rest. Yeah. And I think it shows, for example,
[30:13.440 --> 30:18.480]  in Vesper, like Vesper doesn't support landscape because I think Dave and Brent feel the same way.
[30:19.360 --> 30:25.120]  And I think that's come to bite us on the ass now because on these bigger phones, it really
[30:25.120 --> 30:28.880]  feels weird that an app doesn't support landscape. And maybe it's just because as
[30:28.880 --> 30:32.880]  we're reviewing the phones over the past week, I was doing it a lot just for the sake of seeing
[30:32.880 --> 30:38.720]  what it's like, but it no longer feels silly or some kind of concession to people with
[30:38.720 --> 30:44.800]  particularly a big thumbs or something like that. It feels like it's a first class part
[30:44.800 --> 30:48.480]  of the iPhone interface. Yeah. Well, a big hint to that, I think, you know, the original iPhone
[30:48.480 --> 30:52.720]  didn't even let, let almost nothing go into landscape. What I think Safari did in the video
[30:52.720 --> 30:57.280]  app, almost nothing, but now even the home screen does on the iPhone six plus. I think that's a big
[30:57.280 --> 31:01.760]  hint for people. Yeah, I like, and it's, that's kind of neat too. I like it. And I like the way
[31:01.760 --> 31:06.640]  that the, the doc is always on the right as somebody who on the Mac has always, always worn
[31:06.640 --> 31:11.280]  his doc on the right. It feels very natural. The iPad moves it around with you, but it feels very
[31:11.280 --> 31:16.160]  natural on where's your doc on your Mac. My doc on my Mac is on the left-hand side, but hidden
[31:16.160 --> 31:21.600]  most of the time. I know Renee. All right. This I'm going to get a new guest. I'll fix it.
[31:22.480 --> 31:28.800]  No, you're off. You're off the show. Left-hand doc. Oh, it's gross. No, I don't know. I have
[31:28.800 --> 31:33.120]  always been a right-hand doc person and I'm glad that's where they put it on a phone. I actually,
[31:33.120 --> 31:36.800]  I have it on one of my Macs that's at the bottom and one of it is on the left. Yeah, bottom is
[31:36.800 --> 31:41.360]  acceptable. Although I still think it's weird. The left is just because I forget which one it is,
[31:41.360 --> 31:45.840]  but one of them has that really wide screen and it just seemed to, I want more vertical pixel. So
[31:45.840 --> 31:49.680]  I got it off the bottom and I just stuck it on the left. My problem with doc on the bottom has
[31:49.680 --> 31:56.720]  always been that every Mac screen is horizontal. Yeah. And so vertical real estate is always at
[31:56.720 --> 32:01.040]  more of a premium than horizontal real estate. So why not put it on the side? But anyway,
[32:01.040 --> 32:08.480]  that's neither here nor there. Anyway, back to the event. I think if they had needed to,
[32:08.480 --> 32:14.240]  if the watch, let's say that come August 1st, when they really needed to say, okay,
[32:14.240 --> 32:18.400]  what are we going to do next month? All right. And if they had said, you know what, the watch
[32:18.400 --> 32:24.160]  just isn't ready, even for a pre-announcement, it's not, you know, we got to scrap it. They
[32:24.160 --> 32:31.200]  could have had an event similar to previous iPhone events and then, you know, include Apple pay,
[32:31.840 --> 32:35.840]  just the iPhones and Apple pay and it would have been fine. Yeah. It would have,
[32:35.840 --> 32:39.040]  I think it would have been in a smaller venue. I don't think they would have taken the Flint
[32:39.040 --> 32:45.120]  center. And I think Schiller could have easily gone 60 minutes instead of 30 minutes talking
[32:45.120 --> 32:50.320]  about features on the phones and what's improved. Yeah. And they could have Craig recapitulate
[32:50.320 --> 32:55.120]  WWDC as he's done several years in a row. Yeah. I don't think so though, because I think that's
[32:55.120 --> 33:00.560]  waiting. I think we will see that in, in October, but I feel like that would have been harder to do
[33:00.560 --> 33:06.560]  because at WWDC, they can talk about, you know, look, all this stuff is all beta, right? The,
[33:06.560 --> 33:15.840]  the, the handoff and all the other what's it called the, the catch all phrase for all extensibility,
[33:15.840 --> 33:20.720]  extensibility, not extensibility, the search of the sea, continuity, continuity,
[33:20.720 --> 33:26.480]  all these continuity features. I don't think that they could do it in a September event where iOS
[33:26.480 --> 33:31.840]  is no longer beta, but Yosemite is very true. I think it had, I think that the Federiki stuff,
[33:31.840 --> 33:35.760]  you know, demoing all the continuity stuff has got to wait for October. I think it could have
[33:35.760 --> 33:39.760]  just been, you know, Schiller doing stuff on the phone like he has in past years. And maybe,
[33:39.760 --> 33:45.120]  you know, add, add Tim Cook's usual preamble with the sort of state of the company.
[33:45.120 --> 33:52.880]  Could have had a 90 minute event with, you know, maybe 50 minutes of iPhone six and, you know, the,
[33:52.880 --> 33:57.120]  the rest of it Apple pay and it would have been fine. That's very true because in previous years,
[33:57.120 --> 34:00.560]  Cook would, he'd go over all the results. He'd make fun of Android a little bit. He'd do each
[34:00.560 --> 34:04.960]  show in Apple store opening with a nice video. And this year he, he said, and you know, I think
[34:04.960 --> 34:09.360]  it's worth pointing out, you know, Apple's doing fine. And then they got right into the iPhone.
[34:09.360 --> 34:14.000]  Yeah. And Schiller, I mean, he was flying. I thought, I mean, I thought it, you know,
[34:14.000 --> 34:19.120]  I don't wouldn't say he was rushed and he was polished, but that was a really, really concise,
[34:19.120 --> 34:25.200]  I mean, I think it measured almost exactly 30 minutes and that's really short. And it's almost
[34:25.200 --> 34:28.960]  remarkable how soon they got into it. It was only like seven minutes into the thing and all of us,
[34:28.960 --> 34:33.200]  including three minutes of it for a purely promotional video at the beginning.
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.880]  And it was like, here, here they are. Here's, you know, here's what they,
[34:38.880 --> 34:41.280]  here's what they look like. Here's what they do. Here's what's new. And
[34:41.280 --> 34:44.720]  back to Tim and he was off the stage. And you, you remarked on it at the time,
[34:44.720 --> 34:49.120]  but it was impeccable. It was on the 30 minutes. They finished on the two hour mark. It was perfect.
[34:49.760 --> 34:54.560]  Yeah. It was a very tight event. I mean, I, cause you know, two hours is to them. And I think
[34:54.560 --> 34:59.360]  rightly so it's like the upper limit. And if they do a rehearsal and it's two hours and 10 minutes,
[34:59.920 --> 35:03.600]  no matter how uncuttable, it seems 10 minutes of stuff is going to get cut.
[35:04.640 --> 35:05.440]  Yeah, absolutely.
[35:05.440 --> 35:11.040]  Let's take a second break and, and we'll get back to this. And I guess maybe interrupt the
[35:11.040 --> 35:15.600]  idea of going through the show and, and talk a little bit more about the, the new iPhones.
[35:15.600 --> 35:16.100]  Sure.
[35:17.760 --> 35:25.360]  I want to talk about a second sponsor and sorry, friends at Drobo. Drobo's slogan is smart storage
[35:25.360 --> 35:30.640]  to protect what matters. What's Drobo? It's a gadget you buy. It's external storage that you
[35:30.640 --> 35:37.440]  buy. And it's expandable. So you buy a Drobo and you can plug expanded capacity into it on the fly
[35:37.440 --> 35:45.920]  by adding drives. So it's not a drive. It's sort of sort of like a raid. Except that Drobo stuff
[35:45.920 --> 35:50.000]  is all sort of custom and they let you do things you can't do with a raid like just pull a hard
[35:50.000 --> 35:56.480]  drive out, plug another one in really cool stuff. Like if it's lights up green, it means that drive,
[35:56.480 --> 36:00.720]  you could just pull it out at any time. So if you've got like your Drobo set up with a whole
[36:00.720 --> 36:07.280]  bunch of one terabyte drives, it looks like a larger than that collective storage. And you're
[36:07.280 --> 36:13.120]  getting close to the limit. You can just pull one of the ones that's green out, plug a three terabyte
[36:13.120 --> 36:19.440]  drive in, and Drobo will just take care of it. And what that means is that all the stuff, your bits,
[36:19.440 --> 36:23.920]  your ones and zeros are replicated across those drives. So if you've got like your Drobo set up
[36:23.920 --> 36:29.360]  with a two terabyte drive, the rest of those drives are replicated across those drives so
[36:29.360 --> 36:36.240]  that one physical drive that goes bad isn't going to cause you to lose to lose data. They've been
[36:36.240 --> 36:44.000]  around for a while. And you know, and they just keep getting better and better. The new one,
[36:44.000 --> 36:50.560]  Drobo Gen three is three to five times faster than its predecessors. Three to five times faster. It
[36:50.560 --> 36:59.840]  is, and what they're calling a super speed USB 3.0 interface. You could search for reviews online
[36:59.840 --> 37:07.760]  and and third party will verify that performance connected over USB three is over 200 megabytes
[37:07.760 --> 37:16.000]  per second. Really good stuff fast. It's reliable. It's optimized for time machine. It's almost like
[37:16.000 --> 37:23.760]  the perfect time machine target. Buying one just to use for time machine is perfectly sane idea.
[37:24.320 --> 37:31.200]  You can create separate disk volume on your Drobo partition it, you can create a separate one just
[37:31.200 --> 37:35.280]  for time machine, you could use the whole thing for time machine, whatever you want to do very,
[37:35.280 --> 37:45.040]  very configurable. Bottom line, really cool storage, read all about it. Way more robust
[37:45.040 --> 37:50.480]  and configurable, and expandable. The expandability is the part you buy one,
[37:50.480 --> 37:54.800]  get it set up and later on, you can make it bigger without even shutting down your computer
[37:54.800 --> 38:03.920]  or unmounting the Drobo and a starting price of just $349 which is one third less than its
[38:03.920 --> 38:11.680]  predecessor. And they have a special offer for listeners of the show. 50 bucks off 50 bucks
[38:11.680 --> 38:21.760]  off your purchase of any Drobo at www.drobo store.com. Drobo store.com. Using the code
[38:22.720 --> 38:28.800]  Gruber 50. The 50 is for the 50 bucks you'll save. They have the gene Gruber capitalized,
[38:28.800 --> 38:34.480]  I think it might be case sensitive. So Gruber 50 with a capital G. And you'll save 50 bucks,
[38:34.480 --> 38:42.560]  which can get you one for just $299. My thanks to Drobo. Good friends of the show. So did you
[38:42.560 --> 38:47.920]  order an iPhone six? I did. I ordered my phone six plus, you got a six plus. So what made you
[38:47.920 --> 38:53.040]  go plus, I sort of want to, I want to try it because it is so new. And then there have been
[38:53.040 --> 38:57.760]  big phones in the market before but Apple's take on it, I find really interesting. I love the idea
[38:57.760 --> 39:02.080]  of the split view controller in landscape mode. And I like the idea of the longer battery because
[39:02.080 --> 39:06.000]  you know, especially when we go to conferences or events, I'm roaming most of the time, and the
[39:06.000 --> 39:11.440]  radio is just screaming and draining the battery, that and the optical image stabilization. I don't
[39:11.440 --> 39:14.880]  know how big a deal that'll be on the camera, but I'm really, I really interested in trying it out.
[39:15.520 --> 39:20.800]  Yeah, Matthew panzerinos examples were pretty good. I thought at that. Yeah. You know, and it
[39:20.800 --> 39:26.320]  looks like you get an extra stop or two. And it, you know, can help you shoot at a significantly
[39:26.320 --> 39:32.560]  lower ISO speed even in low light. Honestly, having spent a week with him, I wasn't even
[39:32.560 --> 39:37.520]  tempted by I guess I had to order I ordered on Friday night. So I'd only been or Thursday night.
[39:37.520 --> 39:42.800]  So I'd only had it for three, three days at that point. But there was no no doubt in my mind that
[39:42.800 --> 39:47.200]  I wanted a regular iPhone six. I think that's the safe, not the safe choice is the wrong word. I
[39:47.200 --> 39:52.000]  think that that is the right choice for most people. I think it looks like a lot of people are
[39:52.000 --> 39:57.440]  going for the six plus. And I'm not sure whether that's because they really want a 5.5 inch phone
[39:57.440 --> 40:01.120]  or because they just assume that they, or they just feel like every time Apple puts out a new
[40:01.120 --> 40:05.920]  phone, they're going to get the most expensive one or the what they assume is the flagship phone.
[40:05.920 --> 40:10.080]  I, I don't, it's one of those things, you know, and Apple reveals more than most companies,
[40:10.080 --> 40:14.400]  but there's no way that I expect them to reveal the split between the six and the six plus,
[40:14.400 --> 40:20.240]  because I think that's highly competitive data. But I would be fascinated to know it. And I would
[40:20.240 --> 40:27.280]  also be fascinated to know how it changes over time, because I my hunch is that the early adopter
[40:27.280 --> 40:34.640]  crowd, who does things like preorder one of these before they've ever seen one in the flesh, you
[40:34.640 --> 40:40.000]  know, which I would be doing if I even if I hadn't had the review units already, I would have been
[40:40.000 --> 40:45.360]  preordering anyway. But let's face it, that's sort of a crazy thing to do. Normal people don't go and
[40:45.360 --> 40:56.880]  buy, you know, 6, 7, 800 $900 devices that they haven't even put in their hands yet. I think that
[40:56.880 --> 41:02.400]  crowd skews towards the bigger size, because they're, it's, it's, I don't know, it's just more,
[41:02.400 --> 41:06.560]  I don't know, nerdy that they, you know, they do more work on their phone, it's a little bit less
[41:06.560 --> 41:11.600]  of a passive device and more of an active device. Yeah, well, there's seems to be two groups of
[41:11.600 --> 41:15.680]  people. And one is people who can only have one device. And this is a group that's been really
[41:15.680 --> 41:20.720]  popular in Southeast Asia. And those are essentially usually lower cost, large phones,
[41:20.720 --> 41:26.800]  because they have to have a phone, they just, they need it to basically to live and to communicate,
[41:26.800 --> 41:31.440]  but they want as big a screen size as possible. And then you have people in North America who are,
[41:31.440 --> 41:35.120]  they just want something that's a small tablet that they can carry around. And according to
[41:35.120 --> 41:39.520]  people like Ben Beharin, the large size phones like the Galaxy Note size phones have never sold
[41:39.520 --> 41:43.520]  well in North America previously. So it'll be interesting to see if that's because there's no
[41:43.520 --> 41:48.000]  Apple phone in that category, or if it's really because that category only appeals to a niche
[41:48.000 --> 41:55.680]  market in the industry. I didn't mention this in my review, it's in my notes. And I left it out,
[41:55.680 --> 42:00.960]  because it seemed, you know, it was long enough. And it's, you know, sometimes you got to start
[42:00.960 --> 42:12.640]  cutting stuff. But I think it is going to severely cannibalize sales of the iPad Mini. And I say this
[42:12.640 --> 42:18.400]  as somebody who has used the iPad Mini as my personal, my only personal iPad for ever since
[42:18.400 --> 42:24.080]  it came out two years ago. I even went with the Mini that first year when it was not retina,
[42:24.080 --> 42:31.120]  and I'd already gotten used to the retina display. And, you know, which was a huge trade off. But I
[42:31.120 --> 42:37.440]  like that size for what I use an iPad for primarily, which is, okay, I'm done working
[42:37.440 --> 42:42.720]  for the day in my office here at home. Now I'm downstairs, and I still want to read some stuff,
[42:42.720 --> 42:47.840]  you know, I still want to, you know, do some stuff. But I'm just sitting around the house
[42:47.840 --> 42:52.320]  on the couch or in an armchair or something like that. And I want to use an iPad. I love the Mini
[42:52.320 --> 43:00.960]  for that. I but I think though, overall, it is this device is too close to the Mini. And if you
[43:00.960 --> 43:06.880]  if you have it, the Mini just seems pointless. I think that's very true. I think what else it'll
[43:06.880 --> 43:11.040]  take a while to happen because I think the iPhone six plus is going to be supply constrained, or at
[43:11.040 --> 43:14.720]  least you'll have much higher constraint than that already. Yeah, right now, if you order today,
[43:14.720 --> 43:18.800]  it's already or at least I didn't even check today. But yesterday, I checked in it. That was
[43:18.800 --> 43:27.360]  that was Wednesday, the 17th. It was already quoting three to four weeks. And iPhone six was
[43:27.360 --> 43:32.960]  only quoting three to four days. Yeah. So I think it'll take a while before there's widespread
[43:32.960 --> 43:36.480]  adoption and people who get it not all of them may like it, some of them might decide to go to
[43:36.480 --> 43:41.600]  the smaller one. But what I'm most curious about is whether it just simply cannibalizes the iPad
[43:41.600 --> 43:45.520]  Mini and Apple said before they'd rather cannibalize their own stuff than somebody else.
[43:45.520 --> 43:51.680]  Or if people who previously have an iPhone five or five s and an iPad Mini now move to an iPhone
[43:51.680 --> 43:58.000]  six s and an iPad Air, or maybe you know, theoretically an iPad Pro one day, if you
[43:58.000 --> 44:03.120]  they go from small small to big big instead of getting nothing on the I think it's really
[44:03.120 --> 44:07.760]  I think it's really going to put a dent in the iPad Mini sales. And I think it might put a dent
[44:07.760 --> 44:16.480]  in iPad sales period at least among people who choose the six plus that it to me really is. I
[44:16.480 --> 44:22.240]  you know, I forget exactly how I put it in my review. But it almost as much maybe not quite
[44:22.240 --> 44:32.640]  but almost as much like 40% more like an iPad nano hypothetical iPad nano than it is an iPhone
[44:32.640 --> 44:43.200]  Plus. It's it really did to me feels like a new class of device. More than just a big iPhone
[44:43.200 --> 44:48.000]  really does. And a big part of that is the horizontal stuff, you know, the two column
[44:48.000 --> 44:55.120]  layouts. But even in the portrait landscape, vertical landscape, it just feels in hand,
[44:55.120 --> 44:59.600]  it really to me feels like something you have to use with two hands for the most part, which to me
[44:59.600 --> 45:06.320]  is what makes it a different class device than an iPhone. It's almost the inverse of what happened
[45:06.320 --> 45:11.440]  when the iPad Mini launch because people were used to having a two handed iPad experience and
[45:11.440 --> 45:16.240]  the iPhone, the iPad Mini was almost a hand and a half. And now people are so used to using the
[45:16.240 --> 45:21.600]  one handed iPhone, the iPhone Plus, iPhone six plus is two hands and a half to two handed device.
[45:22.720 --> 45:27.360]  The other thing that's curious, though, and I think would be like, it's almost like a no brainer.
[45:27.360 --> 45:32.240]  And you don't even you know, all the times that they've cannibalized their own products, you know,
[45:32.240 --> 45:40.800]  with the iPod nano, just wiping out the iPod, iPod Mini, even though the mini was the single
[45:40.800 --> 45:47.040]  most popular consumer electronics product in the world at the time, the iPhone having a full
[45:47.040 --> 45:54.480]  unabashed iPod app that eliminated the need to carry a standalone iPod, right, like the
[45:54.480 --> 46:00.320]  traditional tech company way with you had a popular franchise like iPod would have been to
[46:00.320 --> 46:05.200]  like make you tether your iPod to your phone somehow, or something like that, or like the
[46:05.200 --> 46:09.040]  rocker phone, like limit the number just artificially limit the number of songs you can
[46:09.040 --> 46:12.560]  put on your iPhone or something like that. They didn't do anything like that. They were like, hey,
[46:12.560 --> 46:20.400]  it's the bet Steve Jobs called it the best iPod we've ever made. Fine. It's scary because it was,
[46:20.400 --> 46:23.440]  you know, a hugely popular thing. In this case, I don't think they have any reason to fear it,
[46:23.440 --> 46:29.680]  because these things don't don't think about that on contract pricing, which is not the true price.
[46:29.680 --> 46:36.240]  They're their true price is like, three times higher than the price of an iPad Mini. Right?
[46:36.240 --> 46:42.960]  You get iPad Mini starting at 299. Right? Yeah, it's one of these things off contract unlocked
[46:42.960 --> 46:50.160]  are, you know, $800 devices. So if people stop buying iPad Minis for three or $400,
[46:50.160 --> 46:56.560]  so they can buy $900 iPhone six pluses at you know, that's sort of like, anybody can see the
[46:56.560 --> 47:00.320]  business sense in that. That is great for Apple, because they move from a super low margin product
[47:00.320 --> 47:04.640]  to a very good margin product. But one of the things that's always impressed me about Apple
[47:04.640 --> 47:09.600]  as a company is that they've never mistaken their products for their businesses. And we see this in
[47:09.600 --> 47:14.480]  technology so often, like Microsoft with Windows everywhere, where they think that they make
[47:14.480 --> 47:18.960]  Windows and they really don't. Apple never made the mistake that they made iPods, you know,
[47:18.960 --> 47:23.840]  where they made an iPod Mini, they knew that they made personal music devices and would evolve those
[47:23.840 --> 47:28.960]  and those became the iPhone. And now they are not an iPad company, they'll kill the iPad if they
[47:28.960 --> 47:33.280]  have a better idea. They just make these consumer these great devices that you can carry around and
[47:33.280 --> 47:37.280]  whatever the next version of that, they are fearless and moving to it as quickly as possible,
[47:37.280 --> 47:41.600]  because they'd rather do it before somebody else does. And they do, you know, get rid of some
[47:41.600 --> 47:45.600]  profits, they leave money on the table by not dragging out every single nickel out of every
[47:45.600 --> 47:50.560]  single product. But I think when you see how long they've been making really good amounts of money
[47:50.560 --> 47:56.160]  that ultimately leads to everybody's benefit. A good question that I got asked after my review
[47:56.160 --> 47:59.840]  hit and people, you know, realize I had both phones and they could ask me questions didn't
[47:59.840 --> 48:05.040]  occur to me before at all, because I don't use it personally. But I got asked by a couple of people
[48:05.040 --> 48:12.320]  on Twitter, whether the iPhone six plus, in particular, or either of the new ones works with
[48:12.320 --> 48:17.520]  the camera connection kit, which is the little lightning thing you plug in, and then you can
[48:17.520 --> 48:23.920]  plug an SD card into an iPad and import photos, you can take photos with a regular camera,
[48:23.920 --> 48:28.320]  standalone camera, take the SD card, use the camera connection kit, and instead of putting
[48:28.320 --> 48:33.520]  them on a Mac, you can put them on an iPad. And it's always been an iPad only peripheral didn't
[48:33.520 --> 48:39.920]  even occur to me to try it. I did and it's exactly nothing has changed when as soon as you plug the
[48:39.920 --> 48:45.360]  lightning adapter into the either of the new iPhones, it says this this peripheral or whatever
[48:45.360 --> 48:52.880]  it's called is not supported on this device. I wonder though, if that's an oversight, because
[48:52.880 --> 48:57.440]  it seems to me like I never quite understood why camera connection kit didn't work with an iPhone.
[48:58.560 --> 49:04.960]  It's never been clear to me technically why that's the case. You know, if anything, iPhones
[49:04.960 --> 49:10.400]  now have just as much storage as iPads, you know, who knows, maybe they'll double the iPads again.
[49:10.400 --> 49:14.640]  But storage shouldn't be the limiting factor. You know, it should be up to you if you have a 32 or
[49:14.640 --> 49:19.440]  64 gigabytes of storage what you use it for. Yeah, I think that's absolutely true. And I hope it is
[49:19.440 --> 49:22.880]  an oversight because especially now with the bigger screen phones, it makes so much sense. If
[49:22.880 --> 49:26.720]  you're traveling, and you have an iPhone six plus, especially you're not going to want to bring an
[49:26.720 --> 49:31.440]  iPad with you. But you might bring a camera with you might bring something else, like a DSLR, I
[49:31.440 --> 49:36.240]  often take one with me, especially when I go out of town, for this kind of photography that I just
[49:36.240 --> 49:40.640]  don't use an iPhone for. But the ability to bring that all in the DSLRs are still dead. Like there's
[49:40.640 --> 49:46.080]  no there's no camera play like there is carplay. So I need the iPhone to do all the cool modern
[49:46.080 --> 49:51.120]  connected stuff. Yeah, and you know, hopefully it's an oversight because I think it's a clear
[49:51.120 --> 49:54.800]  use. I mean, at least two people on Twitter specifically, you know, and I take it that
[49:54.800 --> 49:58.960]  they're either avid, avid amateur, or maybe even professional photographers. I didn't ask the
[49:58.960 --> 50:06.240]  details, but that they, you know, go out in the field with an iPad, and use that as their, you
[50:06.240 --> 50:10.880]  know, in the field editing and storage device, and they would rather replace it with this, you know,
[50:10.880 --> 50:16.800]  for the obvious reason that it's crazy small compared to an iPad. It's a great way to show off
[50:16.800 --> 50:20.480]  your portfolio, especially for photographers, a lot of them like the iPad, because they can carry
[50:20.480 --> 50:25.200]  a lot of graphics work with the photography worth them and the iPad six and six plus will be great
[50:25.200 --> 50:31.040]  for that too. Yeah, I'm trying to think if there was anything else that I left out of my review
[50:31.040 --> 50:38.080]  that I could use here, but I can't think of anything. I did want to mention the two and see
[50:38.080 --> 50:46.640]  what you think about them, but the two big, well, one's big and one maybe is not as big, but the two
[50:46.640 --> 50:51.360]  negative things I had to say about the Apple's decisions. The first, and it's the clearly the
[50:51.360 --> 50:57.040]  biggest, is their decision to keep the entry level on both phones at 16 gigabytes, and so that the
[50:57.040 --> 51:08.800]  split between $199, $299, $399, and $299, $399, $499 for the two phones is $1664, $128 instead of
[51:08.800 --> 51:15.520]  what to me looks more natural would be double them all, $3264, $128. And I really, like I said
[51:15.520 --> 51:22.400]  in my review, it almost seems punitive to only to ship one of these with only 16 gigabytes. I mean,
[51:22.400 --> 51:28.880]  the original iPhone, the most popular model of it and back in 2007 had eight gigabytes.
[51:28.880 --> 51:34.720]  So the only double it since the original eight product generations ago is ridiculous. And then
[51:34.720 --> 51:40.000]  I forgot about this because I bought my iPhone on day one. But Apple like six months after the
[51:40.000 --> 51:45.520]  original, this is the original iPhone, the original one, the one that only got two 2G networking,
[51:46.400 --> 51:51.600]  they shipped a 16 gigabyte model of it, like in January or something like that. Do you remember
[51:51.600 --> 51:56.560]  that? Yeah, with the price cut, they also increased the storage. Yeah. So in other words,
[51:56.560 --> 52:04.960]  the low end iPhone six plus today has the same amount of storage as the high end original iPhone
[52:04.960 --> 52:10.480]  back in 2007. That to me is it's just nuts. I imagine a MacBook having the same hard drive
[52:10.480 --> 52:16.240]  space on the low end is a 2007. You're a MacBook. Yeah, it's really and I keep seeing everybody
[52:16.240 --> 52:21.040]  today as they upgrade to iOS eight is running into these problems where you need like it wants for
[52:21.040 --> 52:28.720]  four gigabytes free to or four and a half gigabytes free to do the OS update. Yeah. Well,
[52:28.720 --> 52:32.640]  how is that? How are you going to if you've got a 16 gigabyte iPhone today, how in the world are
[52:32.640 --> 52:36.800]  you going to have four gigabytes free next year when iOS nine comes out? And it's worse in some
[52:36.800 --> 52:40.720]  ways because they're still selling an eight gigabyte iPhone five C in there. You know,
[52:40.720 --> 52:45.840]  they've sold eight gigabyte models in India and China and other brick countries before, you know,
[52:45.840 --> 52:50.400]  maybe there'll be an eight gigabyte iPhone five s eventually, who knows. And that last year, you
[52:50.400 --> 52:54.000]  know, there was no way you I could recommend that phone to anybody. It's just it's almost unusable
[52:54.000 --> 53:00.400]  at that point. And now 16 feels like that. I am at eight gigabytes. And with the size of iOS,
[53:00.400 --> 53:06.960]  I honestly wonder how if you took one and did a factory restore on and wiped all of your personal
[53:06.960 --> 53:12.480]  stuff off every photo you've ever taken, none of your own music, do a factory restore? Is there
[53:12.480 --> 53:17.120]  going to be enough room to install iOS nine over the air? I don't even know if that's true. I mean,
[53:17.120 --> 53:27.840]  it's to me, that's crazy. Given what has to be the relatively low price differential Apple would pay
[53:27.840 --> 53:33.520]  for that to double those. It's a punitive is a good word for it as someone also made an analogy
[53:33.520 --> 53:39.120]  to airlines and how you have economy class, business class and first class and how economy
[53:39.120 --> 53:44.000]  class is deliberately made more miserable in an effort to, you know, maybe upsell the premium
[53:44.000 --> 53:47.920]  seating options that are an extra 50 bucks, whatever. And this the typical marketing thing
[53:47.920 --> 53:53.440]  is have the entry level model that gets people in the door. But that entry level model, maybe they
[53:53.440 --> 53:57.120]  still believe that if it was 32 gigs, more people would opt for that. And there'd be fewer people
[53:57.120 --> 54:00.160]  moving to the medium tier and they really want the medium tier to be the normal one.
[54:01.920 --> 54:06.560]  I guess that's the only explanation. Honestly, that I think that has to be it. So I'm not trying
[54:06.560 --> 54:12.160]  to act stupid, like I don't see that angle. But I honestly think that's beneath Apple and in
[54:12.160 --> 54:18.560]  long in the long run, whatever, whatever increase in active or not active selling average selling
[54:18.560 --> 54:25.520]  price they're going to get because of this. The way they've made these tiers, however much money
[54:25.520 --> 54:30.400]  they're going to make on that to me is probably going to be less than the damage it's doing to
[54:30.400 --> 54:36.880]  their brand by selling brand new iPhone six and six pluses that honestly, I think cannot be
[54:36.880 --> 54:43.120]  recommended. I really, I would honestly say that anybody out there looking for buying advice,
[54:43.120 --> 54:49.040]  pretend like those ones don't exist, and that the starting price is 299 and 399 on contract for the
[54:49.040 --> 54:54.640]  64 gigabyte models. Whereas I think 32 gigabytes would be fine if you think that, you know,
[54:54.640 --> 54:59.200]  knowing what how much space you use on your phone now, you know, knowing how much of your music and
[54:59.200 --> 55:05.040]  video collection you like to carry around on the device. You know, I like to put my whole music
[55:05.040 --> 55:11.360]  library on the device, which already puts me close to 64, or at least in, you know, over 32.
[55:12.800 --> 55:18.640]  And then with 128, I will know, you know, for the last couple of months, I've every couple of weeks,
[55:18.640 --> 55:23.280]  I have to delete stuff from my phone, because I get a warning that I'm used up the whole 64 gigs
[55:23.280 --> 55:29.040]  because of shooting high def video and panoramic photos and stuff. So I really want and can use
[55:29.040 --> 55:34.480]  the 128. But I can see how somebody who doesn't store their music could easily get by with 32
[55:34.480 --> 55:38.960]  and have room to spare next year to upgrade iOS nine and stuff like that. But 16 to me is
[55:38.960 --> 55:43.440]  is really a disappointment. There's I've heard an argument from some people in the brick countries
[55:43.440 --> 55:47.440]  that all the phones are used for mainly in those countries because of the way that data plans are
[55:47.440 --> 55:52.080]  set up is you'll get just a phone with a little bit of data and maybe Facebook Messenger or BBM or
[55:52.080 --> 55:56.560]  something. And it's primarily a text based communications device because voice plans
[55:56.560 --> 56:01.200]  are so expensive. And I also wonder if this if the carriers mandate or there's some sort of
[56:01.200 --> 56:06.080]  agreement or there's some feeling that they have to have the brand new iPhone at 199 still because
[56:06.080 --> 56:10.720]  it'd be interesting to see they did keep around the 32 gigabyte iPhone five s if they let that
[56:10.720 --> 56:17.680]  just be the the 199 device and the new iPhone started at 299 with 32 gigs. I refuse to believe
[56:17.680 --> 56:24.800]  that if they made the entry level ones 32 that it would adversely affect their margins. And again,
[56:24.800 --> 56:29.440]  I say this knowing like I said on this show with I think it was with molts a couple of episodes back,
[56:29.440 --> 56:34.640]  it's so easy to armchair quarterback this and and tell Apple to make these decisions that
[56:35.200 --> 56:39.760]  you know, you they really ought to spend more money and go from 16 to 32. Whereas if you
[56:39.760 --> 56:44.880]  multiply out 100 million phones per year, and the difference, you know, even if it's only $1 per
[56:44.880 --> 56:49.600]  phone, it's, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars. And I agree, you know, hundreds of
[56:49.600 --> 56:54.720]  millions of dollars is nothing to sneeze at even for Apple. But in this particular case, it's it
[56:54.720 --> 56:59.600]  just is too much given the way they use it. And you know, they're really promoting these features,
[56:59.600 --> 57:05.440]  you know, with the with the improved camera, which I think is a huge selling point a huge reason to
[57:05.440 --> 57:12.560]  upgrade for regular people. In these cameras, the panoramic photos have gone to like 50 megapixels
[57:12.560 --> 57:17.520]  or 50 megabytes or what I forget what you know, but they're they're they're like twice the size
[57:17.520 --> 57:22.320]  of the old panoramic ones. And you have the time lapse to you can take all those photos and combine
[57:22.320 --> 57:25.600]  them to a video and these are going to be huge people are going to generate huge amounts of
[57:25.600 --> 57:29.920]  content. And I also have to wonder if they did go to 32 gigabytes if any difference will be made up
[57:29.920 --> 57:34.480]  because people might buy more iCloud storage, or they might buy more apps because they can fit,
[57:34.480 --> 57:39.600]  you know, more more premium games, more large size gigabyte filling games on their phone.
[57:39.600 --> 57:43.840]  I mean, it just seems like there's there's better ways of getting people into the iPhone
[57:43.840 --> 57:49.920]  and be an amateur camera guy. I know how amazing it is that you can buy a camera now that does 240
[57:49.920 --> 57:54.640]  frames per second slow motion, right? That's just a couple years ago. That was like a real I mean,
[57:54.640 --> 57:59.760]  shooting that level of slow mo was expensive. And it was hard to find on any kind of vaguely
[57:59.760 --> 58:06.000]  consumerist camera. Now you have it on your phone. But by definition, 100 and 240 frames per section
[58:06.000 --> 58:11.760]  is double the storage size of 120 frames per second. Did you see that 4k app for $1,000 on
[58:11.760 --> 58:16.240]  the App Store? No, yeah, no, tell me about it. So I forget the manufacturer, but they're a well
[58:16.240 --> 58:21.840]  known video production company. They made really smart iPhone and iPad apps. For example, they're
[58:21.840 --> 58:25.760]  the ones who made the app that you can go out into a crowd with a bunch of different people.
[58:25.760 --> 58:30.000]  And everyone will send their video back to the same iPhone or iPad and you can do multi cam
[58:30.000 --> 58:34.480]  editing. And so the new one basically uses the camera instead of the video camera and takes
[58:34.480 --> 58:40.960]  multiple pictures and stitches them together into 4k video right on your iPhone. Wow. Yeah.
[58:41.840 --> 58:45.920]  There's there's really good camera stuff, especially in iOS eight. I have to check that
[58:45.920 --> 58:50.000]  out. What's the name of the app? I have to look it up. But it's it does 4k video and it's $1,000.
[58:50.000 --> 58:55.040]  I'm guessing there's only going to be one of them. 4k. It's I am rich, but actually useful.
[58:56.080 --> 59:03.440]  4k video app for $1,000. God, I'm in the wrong business. Vesper with 4k. Right.
[59:03.440 --> 59:08.000]  That's amazing. I have to look that up. I'll try to remember to put it in the show notes.
[59:09.360 --> 59:15.280]  But I'll probably forget. But what else? I you know, I don't know. I mean, you know,
[59:15.280 --> 59:19.600]  as a guy who just wrote a 4000 word review of the two phones, it's, you know, I feel silly
[59:19.600 --> 59:23.040]  saying there's not that much more to talk about. But I don't know that there's that much more to
[59:23.040 --> 59:26.960]  talk about. I apologize. It's a busy wig. 4k is the name of the app. Is he wig? Okay.
[59:26.960 --> 59:42.480]  Busy wig. How do you spell that? V I Z Z Y W I G 4k. V I Z Z Y G W I G W I G 4k. This wig. Whatever.
[59:43.920 --> 59:47.520]  Well, that seems like a weird name for $1,000 app.
[59:47.520 --> 59:57.440]  I thought it was interesting that they sold more phones than ever before,
[59:57.440 --> 01:00:03.200]  by apparently a long shot. Yeah, it was 4 million pre orders. Yeah, even with the
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:08.400]  whole pre order system shitting the bed almost completely. Yeah, I saw you tweet. I was up until
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:14.160]  I think four or 5am before I got my pre orders done. Eastern time? Yeah.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:21.600]  Oh, I was up later than that. Yeah, that's no you because it was only 3am. Eastern time when they
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:25.840]  went live was supposed to go live. Yeah, and apple.com. The main store page didn't go live,
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:29.360]  but a couple friends of mine sent me direct links about an hour, an hour and a half later,
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:37.040]  which actually worked. I was on the west coast in Portland for XOXO. And so it was midnight for us
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:46.480]  when it first went live. And I tried to last year, I used the the app, the app, Apple store app.
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:54.960]  And at the stroke of midnight, I opened the app. And it was like, not ready yet. And then I
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:59.840]  reloaded. I went back to home screen, open the app again. And it was there. And it was ready.
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:09.920]  And it was like, and I don't know, 1200 15. And I clicked, you know, iPhone five s, space gray,
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:18.640]  64, Verizon, upgrade this phone that I'm on right now. And you know, credit card authorization,
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:25.840]  and by like 1201 30, I was done. And that was it. And Amy was with me, and she did the same thing.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:31.360]  And, you know, then we were, that was it. I got an email. And, you know, the next Friday,
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:36.640]  my phone came. This time, we I spent, I don't know, two hours sitting there, you know,
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:41.520]  when we were having drinks and socializing, but I spent like two hours in the app, I went to the
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:45.760]  apple store.com. And no matter what I did, I couldn't get it to work. And I eventually had to
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:51.040]  resort to going to Verizon. The app was for me, the app started before the website did,
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:55.280]  and it would let me pick the phone I wanted, but the buttons to actually order it never activated.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:59.040]  Yeah, that's exactly what I Well, I had trouble getting there. I would say most
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:02.960]  every most times I tried, I never even got that far. And about one out of three times I tried,
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:10.560]  I'd get all the way to the part where it let me pick iPhone six, space gray, 128, Verizon.
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:17.200]  And the button to say add this to cart just never activated such a tease. Yeah, but right next to
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:20.880]  me, it worked for Amy eventually, but just randomly, you know, like 20 minutes in,
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:25.840]  and she was there just sitting on that screen with the inactive Add to Cart button. And then
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:30.240]  all of a sudden, the Add to Cart button went live. And that was it. Everybody loves Amy.
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.200]  Well, I don't know about that. But yeah, and it was strange, because watching the carrier sites,
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.280]  some of them announced they'd go up later, and they came up earlier. Some people could get to
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:43.840]  Verizon, some couldn't, some could get to AT&T, some couldn't, some got waiting listed. T-Mobile
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:47.840]  took forever. It was they do this every year, and they still can't get their shit together.
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:53.120]  And it's the most for Verizon's worked. I don't think that I had I went through in one shot with
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:58.400]  no bugs. But it's such a design nightmare. And doing it on the phone makes it worse,
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:02.640]  because their site is not mobile optimized, really small fonts, lots of pinching and zooming and
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:06.960]  panning around. But I was out, I didn't have anything else to order with, I had to use the
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.600]  phone. And I just, you know, it ends up I think I could have still ordered the next morning and
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:16.720]  still gotten Friday delivery. But that's because I wanted the six. And I didn't want to take that
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:21.120]  chance that it wouldn't come right away, you know, that it would go to two, three weeks delivery.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:27.520]  I have the Verizon website design wise, and in terms of the ways that they try to
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:35.120]  trick you and get you to buy like, get it with a protection plan, get it with a car charger,
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:40.400]  it's like those bad domain registration sites. Yeah, exactly. It and just the layout of it and
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:44.560]  the colors, all this red, it just reminds me of like, what it would be like to like, get your
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:51.280]  driver's license in if the Soviet Union were still around. Yeah, it's like, it's like some kind of,
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.760]  I don't know, it's probably like what the internet is like in North Korea.
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:02.160]  It's like oppressive. No, and it's Yeah, a company that is designed to sell you phones cannot sell
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.400]  your phones effectively on. Well, you know, apple.com just went responsive. So I don't
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:10.160]  want to be too critical. But if you're selling products that involve mobile, you really should
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:16.400]  work on mobile. Yeah, says a guy whose whose website isn't yet responsive, and whose number
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:21.040]  one platform for page views is iOS. I was really I that's the thing that bummed me out about Apple
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:26.800]  going to apple.com going responsive is I really thought that was the thing that I could I could
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:30.960]  still lean against and say, Well, I'm not the last. Yeah, now, you know, looks like I'm gonna
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:40.320]  be last. Let me take a break here and thank thank our next sponsor, our good friends at linda.com.

[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:55.360]  high production quality, high pedagogical quality, nothing at all like homemade videos that you see
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:06:01.200]  on YouTube. It's a great way to learn, you learn at your own pace, you learn at your own place.
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:09.840]  But it's expert teaching, all sorts of amazing topics, everything, like I said, development,

[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:04.800]  is that I have a deal with lynda.com. This is the same deal I've had before, but for listeners of

[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:38.400]  they are that you'll sign up. So my thanks to lynda.com. What about you? Have any questions
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:45.440]  about the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus from someone who's used it? Not that I can think of. I mean, I got
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:49.440]  to spend about 20 minutes with them in the demo room, so nowhere nearly enough to get my hands
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:54.320]  on them, but I'm not sure I'm going to be able to make any sort of opinion until I've used them
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:59.120]  for a week. What I liked about your review is that you used both of them for a period of time
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:05.760]  and that really sort of cemented how the iPhone 6 Plus wasn't for you. Yeah, I, you know, I'm not
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:13.600]  good at doing, you know, I work slowly and I think slowly and I really wish, I wish that I'd had two
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:19.440]  weeks to do it so I could have done a full week with each one. It just seemed to me like if I
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:24.080]  switched back and forth every day, all day for a week, I'd never get a good sense of either,
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:30.560]  so I thought I'll do three with the Plus first, then three with the 6, and then, you know, write
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:38.480]  my review on the seventh day. And it, you know, when I went, when I switched from the Plus and I,
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:46.000]  you know, I did, I would say 98% of my iPhone usage was on the device I was using. There were
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:54.880]  one or two things that I used my personal iPhone for because I didn't have it on the review unit.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:59.280]  I couldn't get Uber working, for example, on that thing and it was a weird, you know, the,
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:07.920]  you know, this, that the location settings in iOS 8 have changed to be more fine-grained.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:13.280]  Yeah. Well, existing apps that haven't been updated for iOS 8, it puts the,
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:18.640]  and that wanna use your location, it puts them in a weird spot where they, it's like Uber wasn't
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:25.440]  asking me, hey, can I use location services? I never even got prompted. It would just give
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:29.760]  me an error and it gave me the error when I was signing in. I would type my email address
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:34.720]  and my Uber password and hit okay. And instead of saying your password is good, you're in,
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:39.200]  or your password wasn't entered correctly, try it again. After I hit sign in, it would say your
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:45.120]  location can't be determined. And I, it took me like days to figure this out. And then I was,
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:52.240]  I thought, oh, it's, it's not the phone, it's iOS 8. And I went to settings, location, Uber,
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:57.360]  and it's, Uber was listed as one of the apps that wanted location. But instead of saying
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:04.400]  that it was set to don't allow or allow or allow only when I'm in the app,
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:08.800]  it was set to nothing. It was like nothing at all. So if I tapped Uber and then just said here,
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:13.920]  let it use my location while I'm in the app, then I went back to Uber and it all worked.
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:18.560]  But in the meantime, I had to order Ubers around San Francisco, I had to use my real iPhone.
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:22.320]  So there's just one example of something that I couldn't do. But everything other than that,
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:28.320]  I used the review phones. When I switched after three days to the iPhone 6, it was like, wow,
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:32.720]  this is a relief. I think, you know, there's, it's almost inarguable that the iPhone 6 is a
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:36.560]  linear successor to the iPhones that have come before. And the iPhone 6 Plus, like you pointed
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:41.840]  out, is really something new. And we know some people who've had them for a while now. And they,
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:45.200]  you know, the comments are the same, you know, it's not a one handed device. I'm kind of scared
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:49.680]  of dropping it when I try to use it one handed. And I think it's really important that people
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:52.800]  think of it as something else, or they might just get it thinking it's the next iPhone.
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:58.400]  Yeah, I do wonder, like I wrote last year, I do wonder whether there's going to be some
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:04.000]  amount of buyer's regret, where somebody goes in the store, and it just looks so impressive,
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:13.440]  because it does. I mean, it is. It is a striking device physically. And they're gonna say, wow,
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:16.880]  that looks so awesome. I'm gonna get that one. And then when they actually get it, they start
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:20.560]  running into problems like it's hard to get out of your pocket while you're sitting down. It's hard
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:25.280]  to put back in your pocket while you're sitting down. Well, imagine if you go into Best Buy,
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:31.200]  and every television was subsidized. So they were all 200 or $300, regardless of the size.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:36.560]  And you just see 120 inch television, it's 300 bucks, and you're gonna make it yours. And then
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:40.640]  you get home and you realize there's no way to get that thing in unless you take down a wall.
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:48.000]  It's something, it might be something like that. I don't know. I compared it to like the way that
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.280]  people tend to buy oversaturated TVs in Best Buy. Because when you look at them side by side,
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:57.680]  you're not really imagining, you know, you're not looking at it in the right context. And the extra
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:02.760]  saturation is striking, and you think it looks good. And then you get it home. And it's like,
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:07.760]  you realize that skin tones are just way off and everything is it. It doesn't look good. It just
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:11.700]  looks vibrant. And I don't want to scare anybody off because there are going to be people that it
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:14.960]  is going to be a tremendous productivity boom for them. And they're going to love it. And they're
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:20.680]  gonna survive with a small screen before. Yeah, I think it's, you know, but I think most people
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:26.880]  know it when they see it. I had to laugh and I loved it. I didn't mention it online, but I loved
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:32.680]  panzerinos review. I thought it was such a great idea to you know that, you know, and maybe it was
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:36.280]  like a happy coincidence because, you know, his family already had the Disneyland trip planned.
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:44.160]  But what a great, what a great stress test for review units of a phone, then something like that,
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:49.960]  which you know, is, you know, you naturally you don't have to contrive reasons to shoot photos or
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:54.360]  videos. You're on a family vacation at Disneyland, you're going to want to shoot photos and videos.
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:58.320]  And the lighting conditions are all over the place because you might be out in bright daylight
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:04.320]  walking around the park and then you go on a ride where it's super dark. I thought that was a great
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:12.960]  review. But I had to laugh at at his crazy idea of masking the two phones in Android, Android
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:17.800]  smartphone cases and then cutting a hole for you know, the difference in the camera location. Like,
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:25.040]  you don't have to do that. Like he he should have reread the embargo agreement that that yet get
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:30.200]  from Apple when you get a review, like, you're allowed to use them in real life. You don't have
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:34.440]  to hide them. You don't have to disguise them like you're, you know, there'd be no other way to do a
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:39.480]  real world review. You can go out and just use the phone and you don't have to. They give you cases,
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:44.360]  you know, to you know, their cases so you can review the cases too, if you want. But since I
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:49.440]  don't use a case in real life, I don't use a case with my review phones either. I just use them.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:55.600]  There are rules. I mean, for example, everybody knows there's an embargo of when you're allowed
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:02.920]  to publish your any, any kind of writing about it. And you're also not allowed and this part I'm
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:06.720]  actually thinking about emailing them and seeing if they might reconsider it, you're not allowed
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:13.400]  to post to any social media a photo that you've taken with it, which once or twice and I stick
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:18.040]  to it, but once or twice I get XOXO, it kind of stunk because all the photos I was taking,
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:21.560]  I couldn't Instagram any of them. I have to like, what do they call it? Latergram them.
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:28.880]  Yeah. And that is sort of a, it actually sort of makes it so that you can't fully use these
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:32.760]  review phones the way I would use a real phone because I do post things to Instagram or photos
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:38.480]  to Twitter. But you know, a bunch of websites, the minute that happens, we'll say first iPhone
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:43.520]  six camera shots appear on social networks and they'll analyze the flicker information.
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:50.240]  Yeah. I kind of see what, you know, I am sure that's exactly why the rule exists. And you know,
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:54.840]  and it's, it's a very, the way they have it written now is a simple rule. You can't share
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:59.600]  photos from taken with this camera over a social network. Simple. Yes or no, you can't do it.
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:05.000]  Whereas what I guess I kind of want them to do is I wish I could do it without, but with the
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.760]  rule that I can't say, Hey, I took this with an iPhone six, you know, in here, here's a version
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:15.840]  of the same scene taken with an iPhone five. Look at the difference, you know, in advance of the
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:23.080]  embargo date, but just posting, you know, without commenting on it. I don't know. And I don't even
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:28.160]  know, like, does Instagram keep the exif data? I know flicker does. So flicker, I could see
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:33.400]  flicker, I could see, I would, I could see them making maybe a whitelist of you can post to
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:39.760]  Twitter and Instagram. If it, if like exif data is stripped from those apps or something like that,
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:43.880]  any website that makes horribly compressed, overly filtered versions of your photographs are fine
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:48.480]  to post to. Exactly. Right. So maybe they could whitelist a few. But anyway, it's a bit of a,
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:54.960]  you know, it's a bit of a hassle not be able to, I liked pansarinos review too, because he's,
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:16:00.040]  he was a professional photographer and he knows to look for things like how it handles saturated
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:04.240]  reds that you know, I don't that not everyone will look for. And I also the Austin man piece
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:08.680]  that ran on his blog on the verge, we took it with him to Iceland, you know, just to see,
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:13.200]  I cannot ever take photographs like that. But I like to see what the potential is with someone
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:17.360]  who really knows how to use that camera. Yeah, his his review made me feel so much better about
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:22.760]  not really having done any photography testing of mine that I just sort of ran out of time and just
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:27.080]  ran it and didn't really take any side by side pictures to really compare. It's like, well,
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:31.800]  it would have been a waste of time anyway, because his review blew it away, in terms of depth and
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:35.880]  expertise in terms of photography. Yeah, it's like watching someone in Middle Earth take around
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:39.480]  an iPhone six. It's ridiculous. Right. So it just made me laugh, though, that pansarino went around
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:46.440]  Disney World with his is his iPhone sixes in these horribly janky, cut up with hotel scissors,
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:51.160]  Android cases, when he could have just used them out and about. But I will say, as somebody who
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:56.320]  did that for the last week using it just out and about, people recognized it, like last year,
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:01.960]  I don't think anybody did like I because I had an iPhone. I forget what color it was. I already had
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:06.480]  a gold one. I had gold five s. So I guess some people did notice there were some people who
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:10.840]  noticed because I had a gold one and gold was new. But if I had had a space gray one, nobody
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:14.400]  would have known even though space gray is different color than the black that came before
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:19.600]  it. People just don't really notice you know, it's iPhones and iPhone the gold a couple people
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:26.720]  noticed. But testing these two phones in the wild, especially the plus, just complete strangers would
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:31.800]  say, Oh, my God, is that the new iPhone over and over and over again, to the point where and I
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:36.360]  didn't want to be photographed using it. I didn't want anybody posting pictures of me using it. So I
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:40.920]  would say yes, and you're allowed to you you're, you know, you can you don't have to lie. You don't
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:45.880]  have to suddenly run away or something. You can say yes, it's an iPhone, you know, six plus. It's
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:51.200]  a review unit from Apple. But you're not allowed to let people touch it. And you're not allowed to
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:57.400]  demonstrate it in a public way. So you can't say sure, gather around employees of super duper
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:03.720]  burger, and I will show you the the iPhone six plus. So you kind of have to be a little bit of
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:09.280]  a jerk about it. But but you don't have to hide it. And it's you know, you don't have to lie about
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:12.860]  it or anything like that or put it in that case that the same as last year did that change as
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:17.120]  well. No, that's always been the same, as far as at least since I've been reviewing them, which
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:22.560]  started with the Verizon iPhone for what's much better way to test it. If that if the if the
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:26.300]  embargo or the NDA was stricter than that, it'd probably not be a functional test for you. Right?
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:30.800]  It really wouldn't be if you had to, you know, you know, disguise it or something like that locked
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:36.620]  in a room. Right? Because even if I had to put it in some kind of case, it would have affected my
[01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:41.300]  ability to judge just how pocketable it is without a case. Yeah, how do you really what
[01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:48.200]  finishes is so many things. Right. So that made me laugh. It was a great, great extra paragraph or
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:54.920]  two in his article, though. Yeah, it made me laugh that knowing the rules. What do you think about I
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:59.200]  guess if there's anything else that's controversial about the design of the two phones? It's the camera
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:04.700]  nubbin. Yeah. Or the bulge as I'm calling it. I'm not quite sure what to call it. One thing a couple
[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:09.380]  people on Twitter pointed out, and again, because I don't use a case, I guess it occurred to me, but
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:15.320]  it didn't really pop to my forefront is for anybody who does use their iPhone in a case, which I do
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:21.140]  believe to be a majority, if not an overwhelming majority of iPhone users just out and about in a
[01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:26.540]  real world. It seems to me like, certainly many people don't, but it seems like most people do use
[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:31.860]  a case. And if you do use a case, it's absolutely irrelevant, because even the thinnest of cases is
[01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:38.980]  going to be thinner than the thickness of the bulge around the camera lens. Yeah, absolutely. And even
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:44.180]  as I think some people point this out to people who make accessories, like Olloclip can now have
[01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:49.180]  use that as a guide to make sure that it stays in place when they put it on. Yeah, it's, you know,
[01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:54.460]  I would never go so far as to argue that it's therefore a feature and not a, you know, a design
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:20:01.220]  trade off. But there is it's sort of like a silver lining in in the trade off. Well, I mean, the iPod
[01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:06.100]  Touch had this two years ago, three years ago, whenever that launched, and it's because cameras,
[01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:10.260]  Apple talks about the five element lens and cameras really need depth. That's why lenses
[01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:14.740]  sometimes are so thick. It's in the phones, they want to make super thin, and that creates a huge
[01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:18.420]  tension, make the phone thinner, they have to make a worse camera, they're not going to do that. They
[01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:23.260]  did they did a miracle of engineering with the iPhone five to get that eight megapixel camera
[01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:28.180]  in there. And I don't think they could, I'm sure they tried, I don't think they could get it into
[01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:34.180]  a phone as thin as these. And like you said, that was a compromise they had to make. Yeah. Well,
[01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:40.100]  it's not that, you know, I presented three options. First would be use a camera that fits flush and
[01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:45.660]  has worse optics. I think that was out of the question because I believe a camera of that size
[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:50.300]  not only would certainly would have had worse optics than the one they did include, but it
[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:56.060]  might have even had worse optics, probably would have had worse optics than the five s or the five
[01:20:56.060 --> 01:21:00.460]  C. And that's just unacceptable. They can't sell the high end iPhone with a camera that's worse
[01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:08.060]  than the one from a year or two before. I just it's, you know, inconceivable. There's no magic
[01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:12.900]  option to just magically make it happen. And I've seen it on Twitter, a handful of people on Twitter
[01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:18.220]  who have Steve Jobs was there, he would have browbeat them into making a camera that was that
[01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:25.540]  thin enough and didn't sacrifice image quality. Well, I that's not how it worked. He was a, you
[01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:29.380]  know, a great motivator. And he often drove people to do more than they could think they could.
[01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:36.500]  I don't think he could bend the laws of physics. And you know, they still do. They did, you know,
[01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:40.860]  they do things like use Sony sensors, you know, they use components, they don't, the camera isn't
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:45.620]  entirely their own creation. They have like a Sony sensor in there, which already places a starting
[01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:53.620]  limit on how far away the lens has to be to, to cover the whole sensor with an image. So I'm gonna
[01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:59.740]  say that that was out. I think the choice came between doing what they did and having a bulge
[01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:07.180]  around the camera lens or making the whole device as thick as needed be this to sit flush with the
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:13.500]  camera that they have. And then they're, you know, make the battery a little thicker to to take
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:17.900]  advantage of that extra space where they could. And that's the thing that I've a lot of people
[01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:22.700]  pushed back on my review about that they should have, because that would have been better. There's
[01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:29.420]  it still would have been thinner than the five s. How is that not thin enough? And then battery life
[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:34.220]  would have been better on both phones, you know that this is folly on Apple's part because it
[01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:38.860]  would have been better for everybody because a little bit that much more thickness wouldn't have
[01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:41.900]  mattered. It still would have been a thin phone and then battery life would have been better.
[01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:45.500]  It's it's really interesting because a lot of people when Apple went to the iPhone five and
[01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:49.180]  that was thinner than the iPhone four s that you know, just keep it the same as the four s and want
[01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:55.020]  more battery, but everything really is a trade-off and I think Apple is more concerned as obsessed
[01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:59.700]  as they are with thinness and they've made an entirely new backlight just to get it thinner.
[01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:05.060]  I think that is because it translates into weight and I've got like I said I've got a Lumia 1020
[01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:10.020]  and that feels like a brick and the Nexus 5 is about the same size and it feels even though it's
[01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:14.340]  the same size it feels so much smaller because it's lighter and the iPhone 6 Plus felt smaller
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:18.940]  again than a lot of those phones or than the Galaxy Note and I think Apple realized when they
[01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:23.180]  went big one of their goals was to be light so that it didn't it didn't end up feeling like a
[01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:30.300]  weaponized instrument in your hand yeah yeah it is like I wrote my review it's heavier the fuck the
[01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:38.020]  six is heavier than the 5s but it doesn't feel heavier because I think by you know by mass it's
[01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:44.100]  actually lighter you know per per per volume it's it's lighter even though overall it's it's
[01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:48.180]  actually a little heavier and it's that illusion thing again too because I had a chance to see a
[01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:52.780]  bunch of people using them during the week and you look at it then you look at your iPhone 5
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:56.740]  and it's that same feelings when you look back on an iPhone 4s now and it looks like a stunted
[01:23:56.740 --> 01:24:00.780]  little iPhone mini it's that once you see that because of the curves because of the way that
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:05.460]  it's built it just looks so much newer than the iPhone 5 and I think that whole thing combines
[01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:14.420]  together to make the big size more acceptable yeah I think it's reasonable perfectly reasonable to
[01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:19.260]  argue the side of they should have just made both phones a little thicker to let the camera sit
[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:25.700]  flush and have put slightly bigger batteries in perfectly reasonable I think it's not reasonable
[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:32.860]  to argue that what Apple did choose to do is also reasonable and that Apple simply prioritizes
[01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:39.820]  thinness and weight a little bit more than other people do yeah I mean it's interesting because I
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:44.180]  believe the iPod touched at least it was certainly designed while Steve Jobs was still around and
[01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:49.220]  that ship there was no right ban right shipping that so I think you know that that's not it yeah
[01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:55.940]  it's you know we're running out of time to say no actually Steve Jobs actually was there for that
[01:24:55.940 --> 01:25:00.660]  but that's the the protruding camera lens you can't say Steve Jobs never would have done it because
[01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:09.460]  he did he was there when the the iPod touch that has that was was was designed yeah I don't think
[01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:14.660]  people some people have said do they need to do they need to buy a case now because otherwise if
[01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:18.940]  you put your phone flat on a table or something like that the lens is gonna get scratched I don't
[01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:24.100]  think the lens is any more likely to get scratched than it was on the 5s because it's still a sapphire
[01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:33.100]  cover on the outside of the lens and if anything that the metal ring around it would be less likely
[01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:37.700]  to have the you know the lens actually touching the surface of the table that you're on I don't
[01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:41.060]  know it certainly doesn't make me want to put a case on it I'm not worried I was about to ask you
[01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:45.220]  that because in the iPod touch and I'm holding it right now the ring goes a little bit further
[01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:50.020]  than the lens so it does protect the lens now I didn't I forgot to check that I think it does
[01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:54.020]  but it if you know it's very slight but I do think that given that it would just be sitting at a
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:26:00.380]  slight angle I think it means that then you know on a on a perfectly flat table I don't think any
[01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:07.380]  part of the lens would actually would actually touch the table so I think if anything it's a
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:10.180]  little bit less likely and some people have worried about it not being flush when you put
[01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:14.460]  it down on its back on a table but again the iPod touch there's one corner that you can push out
[01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:19.660]  that makes it a little bit it does yeah it wiggles a little bit on a perfectly flat table but it's it
[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:26.020]  doesn't bother me I mean in theory do I wish it were flush of course but you know I same thing
[01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:30.700]  with the lines for the antenna lines you know people are asking about those you know I didn't
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:35.020]  even mention them in the review what are they're fine I don't I don't think that they're bad I
[01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:39.740]  don't think they're good I mean you know there's always some kind of concession to the antenna in
[01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:45.660]  every single phone I mean the original iPhone had a big black plastic thing on the bottom inch of it
[01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:51.340]  you know it's it it's fine yeah I don't know my wife actually thinks it looks good on the gold
[01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:57.820]  ones almost like like the way that on like a handbag or like a woman's jacket or something
[01:26:57.820 --> 01:27:02.780]  like that the the pattern of the panel you know that sometimes at the seams of a piece of clothing
[01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:07.100]  or something like that are meant you know they're stitched in a different color you know that it
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:13.780]  looks something like that so it's like Boba Fett it's great yeah one last thing before we move away
[01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:21.980]  from the phones is I want to I want to hopefully this will show up on the audio I've got three
[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:31.780]  phones in front of me right now the my 5s the 6 and the 6 plus and I'm going to toggle the silent
[01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:36.160]  switch on and off holding it up against the microphone so I'm going to start with the iPhone
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:51.420]  5s hmm could you hear that all right now here's the six could you hear that that was much harder
[01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:59.020]  to hear but I heard it much harder to hear lower right so the six is a much quieter vibration now
[01:27:59.020 --> 01:28:11.860]  here's the 6s I mean the 6 plus 6 plus one more it's way louder yeah it's really I'm just sitting
[01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:17.620]  here and I'm actually gonna power this one down because I'm getting notifications and it's allowed
[01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:22.580]  even sitting on my desk that I know that they're showing up in the audio for the show it's a really
[01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:28.700]  loud silent switch almost problematically show and even I even double-checked with Apple to make sure
[01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:32.980]  that I didn't get a unit with you know that was abnormal in that regard they said no it is a
[01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:37.660]  little bit louder it's also way stronger it's it's like there's no way you can miss it I wonder if
[01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:41.140]  that's a concession to the idea that not as many people might pocket it but they might put it in a
[01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:45.940]  bag or a purse or something yeah I don't know maybe it's on purpose yeah maybe that is true I
[01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:50.220]  don't know but I'm surprised more people haven't commented on it in the initial reviews because it
[01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:55.460]  is a real difference especially compared to the regular six which is even quieter than previous
[01:28:55.460 --> 01:29:00.180]  iPhones huh that's interesting it's almost to the point where it's like I don't even think you'd
[01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:05.540]  call it silent mode you'd call it vibrate mode because it's it's not silent and in a room I
[01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:11.620]  almost wonder like in a room with you know if there was like a meeting and people put their
[01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:15.980]  phones in front of them you know that it's it's gonna be almost problematic that that it you know
[01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:22.420]  this is yeah a lot of boardrooms are gonna have trouble yeah I don't know let me take one last
[01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:28.780]  break here and thank our last sponsor last but not least our good friends at hover hover is the
[01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:34.060]  best domain name registrar in the world I say that without hesitation that's not their description
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:42.260]  of them that's mine you want to get a new domain name go to hover.com it's the best and it's funny
[01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:45.940]  thinking about domain names because I have I you know last few I've registered have not been at
[01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:51.260]  dot-com I have very few that are dot-com and I've always thought hey dot-com is all used up there's
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:55.300]  no way you're gonna get anything on dot-com you got to go to some kind of new top-level domain and
[01:29:55.300 --> 01:30:03.300]  then our new friend Jason Snell just registered six colors calm still good names available even
[01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:09.220]  at dot-com still good names especially if you put two words together great name for a new site six
[01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:15.700]  colors calm your whatever you want to do you know go to hover they'll help you search they'll help
[01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:22.220]  you find awesome domain names that are still available they have all the big top-level domains
[01:30:22.220 --> 01:30:32.700]  a whole bunch of all these crazy new ones like dot guru and dot Club and dot coffee they've got me
[01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:40.940]  I mean you name it they've got it you can go there and do it and it's no hassle no spam no junk no
[01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:46.660]  trying to upsell you on things that aren't even related to domain names really good user interface
[01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:53.740]  for managing it and the most amazing thing at all unique in the whole industry is their free
[01:30:53.740 --> 01:31:01.060]  valet transfer service so if you've got domains registered since the 90s at three or four different
[01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:07.940]  registrars all over the internet or even if you have all your domains at one registrar but it's
[01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:13.020]  a registrar you're not happy with which is very very likely if it's not hover you sign up at
[01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:18.900]  hover go to their free valet transfer service and they will transfer you to an expert someone who
[01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:24.020]  does this as their full-time job you give them your credit you know your information for the
[01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:29.820]  registrar or registrar's where your domains already are and they'll just go and move them
[01:31:29.820 --> 01:31:34.060]  all to hover and make sure all the DNS still works any websites that they're connected to
[01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:40.140]  still work that the mail records that everything just happens seamlessly and that all these little
[01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:46.220]  finicky details managing the time to live and and all this stuff you don't have to worry about any
[01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:50.780]  of it just let hover take care of it and then all of a sudden they'll all be moved over and
[01:31:50.780 --> 01:31:58.660]  everything will be better because hover is better some registrars even purposefully make it hard to
[01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:04.220]  move your domain names away from them hover knows all their tricks they'll help get around them they
[01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:07.820]  know all the tricks and they'll do it with things that you wouldn't even think to know they know how
[01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:13.180]  to do it and it's free it's free you don't have to pay extra it's not like well all right you sign
[01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:17.020]  up for the hover at a reasonable price but then if you want to use this valley service you have
[01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:21.960]  to pay a couple hundred bucks or something no free it's free and they do it because that's how
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:28.900]  confident they are that once you sign up for hover you're going to be a customer for life all sorts
[01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:34.220]  of new things they have volume discounts on domain renewals so if you have more a lot of domains you
[01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:40.940]  can get a volume discount with just ten ten domains at a time review them all renew them
[01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:49.380]  all in bulk and you'll save money you can get your own custom email all sorts of great stuff cannot
[01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:54.460]  wreck them and them highly enough anybody who's not using them should if you have a new name for
[01:32:54.460 --> 01:33:00.580]  a new idea for a domain name go sign up for them and start here's what you can do you get 10% off
[01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:04.700]  your first purchase in addition to all the great stuff honestly you don't even need a discount to

[01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:20.900]  the promo code for this show which in the current campaign is the word chowder c-h-o-w-d-e-r as in
[01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:27.700]  a in-joke reference to claim chowder go to hover.com sign up and you'll save 10% on your
[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:33.980]  first purchase using the code word promo code I guess not really a code word chowder so my thanks
[01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:40.300]  to hover awesome awesome domain name registered and longtime friend of the show man we still have
[01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:44.860]  iOS 8 to talk about I say skip the rest of the event I want to cover that on on future shows
[01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:49.580]  seriously we just don't have time before we get to iOS 8 though I guess we could talk about Apple
[01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:55.300]  Pay yep and I'm wondering what what you think about that it's really interesting because I
[01:33:55.300 --> 01:34:01.000]  have NFC everywhere around me Sears takes it McDonald's takes it the gas stations take it
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:07.180]  it's just it's everywhere so I have both my credit cards have little NFC sticker on them
[01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:11.860]  I was like are the printing on them and you go up and you tap the gas pump you tap the cash
[01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:17.860]  register and it just works and it's it's great and the idea of having that on my iPhone so I don't
[01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:21.900]  my only concern with it is if I ever drop my card you know someone can pick it up and go start
[01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:26.620]  tapping for gas or tapping for food and it'll take a while before I realize it so having it
[01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:30.540]  on my phone is hugely appealing because I don't have to carry those credit cards with me I don't
[01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:34.340]  have to worry about dropping them and because they're doing it in such a secure way where
[01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:39.540]  they're encrypting everything they're they're putting it on the the secure the secure element
[01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:44.260]  and they're doing this one-time credit card number it's it's even better than the convenience that I
[01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:48.980]  already have with NFC so I'm really excited yeah I think it's one of those cases where what Apple
[01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:54.020]  said is exactly the truth and there's no reason to be cynical about it but Tim Cook's explanation
[01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:57.300]  that look everybody's tried to do this before and they've all fallen short and the reason they've
[01:34:57.300 --> 01:35:02.060]  fallen short is that they've come up with schemes that are built around their own self-interest in
[01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:08.060]  other words I think because they want to make a lot of money on it an app rather than approaching
[01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:12.820]  it as let's look at it from the perspective of the customer and just make their experience better
[01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:17.980]  and let the fallout come after that they're gonna make money on this there's no doubt that app you
[01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:21.700]  know this isn't saying that Apple is doing it for free and you know all the money is passing
[01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:25.220]  through without them getting but they're not making a lot per transaction they're taking a
[01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:32.580]  tiny little sliver of the transactions and they're not asking retailers to install an Apple back-end
[01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:39.940]  system they're not asking retailers to install Apple's you know proprietary iPhone only thing
[01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:44.420]  at the register it's an industry standard it's already in hundreds of thousands of locations
[01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:50.820]  they're just making it work easier than anybody else has and it's really just I think primarily
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:57.500]  just about making it another way that it's nicer to own an iPhone than it is to own any other phone
[01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:02.860]  that's the main advantage to Apple it's not about the fraction of a penny per transaction that
[01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:08.500]  they're gonna make although I'm you know they'll keep that money I think it's primarily a way to
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:15.740]  just you know it's you know why do they sweat over the details of putting in a higher 400 pixel per
[01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:21.380]  inch display in the iPhone 6 because it's nicer for customers you know I think that's what Apple
[01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:27.060]  Pay is all about and I therefore think and I mean this I don't think you know I think there's some
[01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:33.540]  people who are gonna roll their eyes but I think it's it's win-win-win it's good for Apple because
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:39.900]  they will make some money on this and it will make iPhones a little bit stickier as something
[01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:43.900]  that people are once they have it they're gonna want to keep buying them I think it's good for
[01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:48.380]  customers because I think it's an amazing experience and we got to play with it like they
[01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:54.220]  did have they had like play read you know play registers set up at the hands-on area it's if
[01:36:54.220 --> 01:37:00.620]  anything their demo video in the in the keynote undersold how easy it is it's really really
[01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:06.460]  convenient and then it's good for the retailers Apple isn't charging them like some kind of crazy
[01:37:06.460 --> 01:37:12.620]  70-30 split they're not asking for an exorbitant amount of money they did get preferential treatment
[01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:17.220]  in terms of getting the rate that was there for when the you know the card present rate as opposed
[01:37:17.220 --> 01:37:22.940]  to the card not present rate but I think that's fair and reasonable that they're saying hey touch
[01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:28.660]  ID combined with the security measures we've taken is the equivalent of card present it's
[01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:33.580]  you know just a little bit more likely that this is not a fraudulent transaction you know that
[01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:38.180]  they're not getting charged the rate that gets charged when you just read your credit card number
[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:42.300]  to somebody over the phone which is where you don't get card present because they don't see
[01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:47.420]  that you have the card it reminds me of that piece you wrote after WWDC called only Apple
[01:37:47.420 --> 01:37:52.460]  because yeah if you think back to when Google tried to do this it's almost like when they tried
[01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:56.140]  to do TV is that they didn't get by and they couldn't get things past carriers some carriers
[01:37:56.140 --> 01:37:59.540]  blocked it some carriers who wanted to use their own because they have their own used to be called
[01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:03.180]  Isis I forget what they renamed it their own solution for these things and they just they
[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:08.340]  just couldn't get it deployed and Apple because they make everything from the chip to the secure
[01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:14.120]  enclave and the secure I forget what the name for it is a secure element all the way up to the OS
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:18.540]  and to the hardware it's better than having the credit card present because again I can just drop
[01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:22.380]  my NFC card and someone else can pick it up and go tap things there's no password there's nothing
[01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:28.700]  required this needs my passcode or my fingerprint and that I think makes it I heard a rumor that it
[01:38:28.700 --> 01:38:33.300]  was after Target and after you know after a lot of the credit card breaches that the the industry
[01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:37.220]  started listening to Apple they weren't as receptive beforehand and I think it's really
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:41.340]  telling that they had launch partners like they demoed the target app and the Apple store app and
[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:46.220]  it's not just this thing that you can use in registers they because again only Apple they
[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:51.020]  have the apps they made a solution that works on the phone in physical real-world stores that
[01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:56.340]  works online with apps and that works based on a physical skin connection with the watch and that
[01:38:56.340 --> 01:39:05.740]  that isn't very robust solution yeah it's very very true and you know like I said win win win
[01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:09.780]  the retailers are happy to use it the banks are happy to use it because they're so they
[01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:14.180]  seem so confident that you know what Apple's come up with is going to increase security and
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:24.580]  fraud is such a huge time and cost and PR sink for the banks and for retailers right I mean you
[01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:31.380]  know the target CEO lost his job over the debacle that that happened to them last year it's a real
[01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:38.980]  problem this seems like you know if it works as advertised is a completely credible solution and
[01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:44.980]  it was so it really is it's better for every party involved nobody's paying any sort of there's no
[01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:50.940]  trade-off for anybody as opposed to something like let's just compare it to the 70-30 split
[01:39:50.940 --> 01:39:59.580]  for it on device content that sold on on the phones I think that's you know it there's a you
[01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:04.740]  know years-long argument that hey that's too much you know that you know Barnes & Noble shouldn't
[01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:09.580]  have to spend you know or can't you know afford 30% margins because they're paying you know
[01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:16.340]  they're paying the same agency model for books that anybody else is you know should Amazon let
[01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:22.580]  the Kindle you know use in-app purchases no why don't they you know there's all sorts of arguments
[01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:26.620]  to be made there where where the 70-30 split depending on your perspective may not be in
[01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:31.300]  the interest of whoever's selling the goods there's no there's no downside like that with
[01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:36.500]  Apple pay it's really is better for everybody and there was some confusion because some people
[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:42.020]  thought that the 70-30 split would it would be for example if Amazon like the Amazon app used
[01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:45.900]  it not the one for the Kindle store but for the actual buying goods but the 70-30 was never for
[01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:49.420]  physical goods it was always for the digital distribution goods within apps so they're fine
[01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:56.140]  any target everyone can adopt this and all they're doing is the Apple pay so last segment
[01:40:56.140 --> 01:41:00.820]  and I want to keep it short because I don't want to just regurgitate your excellent excellent iOS
[01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:06.340]  8 review which anybody who's listening to the show if you haven't put it in the show notes but go
[01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:12.300]  read it it is long it is 20,000 words it is booklet length but it is worth it and it's to
[01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:20.940]  me definitive what are the the things the little things in iOS 8 that you think people are most
[01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:25.620]  likely to overlook like what you know a couple of things that people who listen to the show maybe
[01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:32.140]  think that they're tuned into what's new in iOS 8 they've seen you know the keynote at WWDC but
[01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:37.260]  that are like oh I didn't know about that I think there's two one is really big and some are really
[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:41.740]  small the really big thing is because there's names like extensibility and there's all sorts
[01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:47.780]  of different things like widgets and action custom actions custom keyboards custom sharing items but
[01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:53.300]  when you come down to it the huge transformation for me with between iOS 7 and iOS 8 is that
[01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:58.220]  entirely reversed the before everything was pull if you wanted to do something you had to leave
[01:41:58.220 --> 01:42:02.660]  what you were doing go to another app for example just sending a voice memo you had to leave messages
[01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:08.020]  go to the voice memo app create a voice memo bring up the embedded message sheet and then use that to
[01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:12.780]  send it through messages then go back to messages and continue your conversation and it's like it
[01:42:12.780 --> 01:42:18.900]  was like that for so many things if you wanted to share a URL in a non integrated app like Google
[01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:23.420]  Plus you'd have to go to the web copy the URL one password yet to launch one password copy the
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:28.260]  password come out and now everything it's the model is so much more towards push data where
[01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:33.020]  from interactive notifications you can keep playing your game keep watching your movie quickly answer
[01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:39.100]  a message you pull down notification center the widgets right there the Android model was always
[01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:43.500]  old century to me because you had to leave go to the home screen page through the home screen find
[01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:48.340]  the widget it really didn't save you that much time being a notification center saves you so much
[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:53.620]  time storehouse now you don't have to go to storehouse and then you know open up the image
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:58.620]  picker and choose images you can be in photos you can use filters in there you can use like the
[01:42:58.620 --> 01:43:05.540]  sharing options so many aspects of iOS now bring the stuff to you where you are and that is such
[01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:10.580]  a fundamental change to how I'm using my iPhone and I think Federico did a great job explaining
[01:43:10.580 --> 01:43:15.020]  that too that it's I don't want to call it revolutionary so I think that's over over used
[01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:21.100]  but just the change in workflow has made it less of a choice made it much more much is maybe a
[01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:30.740]  device work for me much more than it ever has before yeah it almost it's like the way that to
[01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:40.660]  me that they broke down the Unix you know we're talking 40 year old Unix multitasking model to a
[01:43:40.660 --> 01:43:52.060]  lower level with the original iPhone in 2007 which was you know panned far and wide by people for
[01:43:52.060 --> 01:44:00.940]  not supporting multitasking which was held up by the ignorant as sort of you know like it's sort of
[01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:07.180]  a baby OS that can't do multitasking whereas anybody with any sort of clue would realize
[01:44:07.180 --> 01:44:14.980]  well they started with Mac OS 10 which was Unix they took multitasking out right this isn't like
[01:44:14.980 --> 01:44:21.180]  Mac OS was back in the 90s or Palm OS or something like that where there was a non multitasking
[01:44:21.180 --> 01:44:26.780]  operating system that grew to a point where they had to add it or glom it all that original demo
[01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:31.140]  with Steve Jobs when he showed playing music the phone rang the music faded away he answered the
[01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:35.860]  phone he went into the web he went to email he went that blew people's minds who knew multitasking
[01:44:35.860 --> 01:44:40.780]  at the time right and there were things that did multitask but there were a lot of others
[01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:46.340]  that didn't and that you know you'd hit the home button and the app would exit and you know when
[01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:51.700]  you relaunched it it would start all over again it was all based on the constraints that incredible
[01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:58.060]  constraints of the device with limited RAM and then limited you know a CPU that's 85 times less
[01:44:58.060 --> 01:45:04.140]  powerful than the one we have in the iPhone 6 but it was also you know not just those technical
[01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:09.300]  constraints but I think it was a reimagining of the user experience of a personal computer that
[01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:16.220]  could you'd want to do things like respond to a text message while you're watching a video and
[01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:25.780]  that they've built it back up with XPC in a way that really makes a ton of sense and you don't
[01:45:25.780 --> 01:45:30.860]  even have to think about it too much from a user's perspective right it's just they're just here's
[01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:35.420]  a notification from Renee asking what time the show is gonna start tonight and I'm watching a
[01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:38.980]  Yankees game you just pull it down a little bit and respond right there and I didn't have to
[01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:48.340]  interrupt the video stream but at the same time solves so many problems from a typical user's
[01:45:48.340 --> 01:45:55.220]  perspective of what can happen with the traditional multitasking where everything just gets to run and
[01:45:55.220 --> 01:46:01.780]  runs forever of Unix where you know your whole thing can get slowed down because everything's
[01:46:01.780 --> 01:46:09.980]  running in the background unchecked and not even to mention the security and privacy issues it's
[01:46:09.980 --> 01:46:13.460]  incredibly or you know the same thing you're on a website you want to quickly check the score you
[01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:17.180]  can just pull down notification center and the score is in there and you just put it back up you
[01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:21.620]  go right back to where you're doing which is a change the multitasking was great you could tap
[01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:25.580]  a notification you go right to the app but then to get back to where you were you'd have to leave
[01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:29.940]  that app double tap if you remember to do that go back to the fast app picker take the app you had
[01:46:29.940 --> 01:46:35.260]  or if you want to switch another app it was just it was not ideal and the other advantage to like
[01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:39.580]  the security the privacy that's enormous because if you're answering a message in the Facebook app
[01:46:39.580 --> 01:46:44.860]  Facebook has no idea what you're typing and that is completely separate but if for example if you
[01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:49.820]  have a Facebook notification in another app and Facebook is being a memory hog and Jetsam gets
[01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:53.860]  rid of it that notification is completely independent you'll still be typing your message
[01:46:53.860 --> 01:46:57.580]  or answering your notification you'll never even notice what's happening with the container app in
[01:46:57.580 --> 01:47:02.620]  the background and that's a huge reliability boon yeah the really I maybe the best layman's
[01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:08.500]  term way to think about extensions and and these things is that they really are like mini apps that
[01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:14.500]  run in their own little mini sandbox yeah and it takes an explicit user action to punch through
[01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:20.660]  that which is a great way of doing it yeah yeah what else anything else that's sort of like easily
[01:47:20.660 --> 01:47:26.700]  overlooked wow I can't believe that's sort of you know I can't I didn't know about that there's a
[01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:32.500]  lot of really nice things for example if you're in Safari and you go to iCloud tabs you can you
[01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:38.260]  can get you can close iCloud tabs on other devices from the device that you're using which is I did
[01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:43.020]  not know that see now that's why I had you on the show it's that is a feature I've wanted ever since
[01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:46.700]  they invented iCloud tab I mean there's so many things are filling in I also love that you can go
[01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:50.780]  to the settings and go to the settings for any app and you go into them and there's a tab for
[01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:55.620]  notifications there and a tab for privacy there you know maybe I don't I don't know how to find
[01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:59.860]  that and they made it easy for developers to get to that but I just go there and I can see what
[01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:05.020]  this has permission for and I can turn them on or turn them off explain to me because this here's
[01:48:05.020 --> 01:48:10.460]  something I'm confused about explain to me user versus remote notifications which is a new
[01:48:10.460 --> 01:48:15.220]  distinction that didn't exist before and now it does so I mean I'm not a developer so you know
[01:48:15.220 --> 01:48:19.860]  I needed like a Brent Simmons type explanation for this but in my understanding is right now
[01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:24.500]  you're automatically opted into the the remote notifications and what that does is things like
[01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:30.780]  background refresh so a developer can send a silent notification in essence to tell your app
[01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:35.580]  that there's new content to download or there's a new messages or a new timeline to pull in and
[01:48:35.580 --> 01:48:39.580]  it'll just go and do that in the background and you're automatically opted into that you can
[01:48:39.580 --> 01:48:44.300]  choose to go and opt out of it but they just want that to work they don't want any confusion and that
[01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:50.180]  is now separate from the user facing notifications like a message notification or a reminder or an
[01:48:50.180 --> 01:48:57.020]  invitation or something hmm third-party keyboards have you tried any of them yeah I've tried several
[01:48:57.020 --> 01:49:03.620]  of them they work in the same way the you download an app the app the only problem with the third
[01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:08.300]  party keyboards is that they're not as easy to install when you download a widget for example
[01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:12.220]  you pull down notification center it tells you there's a new widget you tap the edit button you
[01:49:12.220 --> 01:49:16.100]  can add it right there the keyboards they don't tell you there's a new keyboard so you can download
[01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:19.820]  it you go to the keep you pull up the keyboard there's no indicator that says there's a new
[01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:23.700]  keyboard available they have to either tell you in the app or you have to know to go to settings
[01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:28.820]  keyboards add third-party keyboard and then enable it and also because the container apps are so
[01:49:28.820 --> 01:49:33.940]  small if you have a really hefty keyboard with a lot of predictive text engines or something that
[01:49:33.940 --> 01:49:38.900]  has to stay in the container app so you have to grant it access there's a grant full access button
[01:49:38.900 --> 01:49:42.580]  on the keyboards and it has to be able to you know talk back and forth with this app to do a lot of
[01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:46.780]  the higher level stuff yeah it doesn't I have to say that doesn't seem appealing to me at all it's
[01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:51.140]  a little buggy as well because it'll sometimes it'll revert to the wrong keyboard so it's not
[01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:57.540]  it's not perfect yet but it's this is extensibility I'd say extensibility 0.9 a verging on 1.0 there's
[01:49:57.540 --> 01:50:01.580]  just so much stuff and it's such a fundamental change that I can't even imagine how many bugs
[01:50:01.580 --> 01:50:07.180]  they're squashing even as it's shipping what's your take on quick type quick type is the new
[01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:11.420]  predictive text thing where it shows a couple of words above the keyboard it takes like an
[01:50:11.420 --> 01:50:16.900]  extra row of keys above the keyboard instead of just showing you one suggestion in line where
[01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:22.140]  you're typing I still have to I've been using it since I installed it the first day WWDC I think
[01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:27.340]  you laughed at me when I saw you at the bar but I like that I like to like to see where it is
[01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:31.260]  almost immediately enforce myself to use it and I still don't remember to use it because I'm so
[01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:37.380]  used to typing the traditional way on an iPhone yeah yep that's exactly me I almost don't have
[01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:40.740]  an opinion on it because I don't even look at it because I just typed the way I've always typed
[01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:46.540]  and my habits are so ingrained there's two changes to iOS that makes me feel old in a way and one is
[01:50:46.540 --> 01:50:50.980]  that there's so many people especially who use non iOS devices who are used to Swift key or swipe
[01:50:50.980 --> 01:50:56.660]  and they really wanted it and an Apple's keyboard was outdated in that regard but also you take
[01:50:56.660 --> 01:51:01.460]  something like I message and you know as much as we you know you or me or guy might tease Ben
[01:51:01.460 --> 01:51:06.220]  Thompson about using line and using like having whole conversations and stickers there's a whole
[01:51:06.220 --> 01:51:09.920]  generation of people who instant messaging is really instant like you touch something and it
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:14.820]  goes and it makes me so nervous because Apple's doing that now and for arbitrary treks text
[01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:18.020]  strings they can't do that because they don't know when you're finished typing but if you hit like
[01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:23.220]  location in the message thing it just goes if you hit if you if you use that new the radial
[01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:27.460]  interface to make a voice message just slide up it doesn't populate the field and then let you
[01:51:27.460 --> 01:51:32.180]  hit send like you know someone afraid like I would do it just goes so the instance because I'm so
[01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:37.540]  fast it does that with the images too when you send an attachment you pick the image and say use
[01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:42.220]  this image and then it just sends the message it doesn't sit there in the text field as a message
[01:51:42.220 --> 01:51:46.700]  waiting for you to hit a send by a second send button and it's also ephemeral now almost like
[01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:53.100]  like snapchat where it'll by default it'll expire in two minutes unless you say keep it and then
[01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:57.060]  it'll tell the other person your message has been kept or they've stopped doing it they're they're
[01:51:57.060 --> 01:52:01.420]  they're being very transparent and what's being done and where and I think that's good yeah I'm
[01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:05.580]  curious to see how the sound bites play out because I have I've had it on a beta phone all
[01:52:05.580 --> 01:52:09.380]  summer but I haven't really had a chance to use it because the sound bites don't really work unless
[01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:14.780]  everybody's on iOS 8 if you're if you send one to somebody who's still on iOS 7 or another device
[01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:21.740]  they just get like audio file attachment which they can click and play but it's it it sounds
[01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:27.020]  like you're giving them a shit sandwich you know you're giving them a word a doc file instead of
[01:52:27.020 --> 01:52:32.540]  just typing out your email but with everybody on iOS 8 if you're you know your correspondent is on
[01:52:32.540 --> 01:52:36.260]  iOS 8 then they can play it just they can just play it by lifting the phone to their ear yeah
[01:52:36.260 --> 01:52:40.260]  it's great on the lock screen to I Clayton and I were playing with this a little while ago you send
[01:52:40.260 --> 01:52:43.860]  a message and it shows up and it says lift to listen so you pull it up and you listen to the
[01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:47.220]  message and then you can record another message and you put it down and it sends it and it becomes
[01:52:47.220 --> 01:52:54.860]  almost like a walkie-talkie just slinging these sound bites back and forth the one last thing
[01:52:54.860 --> 01:53:04.980]  before we wrap up is and and the fast contacts didn't make sense to me at I at WWDC this is now
[01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:11.140]  when you go into multitasking you double tap home and above your multitasking windows there's a row
[01:53:11.140 --> 01:53:17.860]  of your recent recipients our contacts just seemed weird to me like they were just shoving something
[01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:22.300]  into empty space all of a sudden it makes a little bit more sense to me with that communication
[01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:28.340]  button on the Apple watch because it's the same thing it's like we're gonna make it really easy
[01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:35.380]  to just sort of very quickly no matter what you're currently doing somehow communicate with the
[01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:41.380]  people who you communicate with most frequently both iOS 8 and the watch seemed to be a concerted
[01:53:41.380 --> 01:53:48.380]  effort to make logging authentication remote control and communications really work well
[01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:52.780]  and work quickly there was in the earlier versions those contacts were there all the time and I
[01:53:52.780 --> 01:53:56.580]  thought you know maybe that's not good for privacy if you didn't want everyone glancing at who you
[01:53:56.580 --> 01:54:00.460]  were talking to especially get complicated relationships you can hide those now but if
[01:54:00.460 --> 01:54:04.660]  you're fine with that you have both your favorites and your reasons and you tap those and you can
[01:54:04.660 --> 01:54:09.860]  instantly FaceTime them call them message them it's once you get used to it it's super quick
[01:54:09.860 --> 01:54:14.860]  we're running up against two-hour mark we could go on for another two hours but that's why they
[01:54:14.860 --> 01:54:22.780]  make next week's show Renee Ritchie at I'm more calm we want to shout out some of your podcasts
[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:28.980]  sure I do a podcast called debug with guy English I do one called iterate with mark Edwards and Seth
[01:54:28.980 --> 01:54:35.540]  Clifford and with our mutual friend Dave whiskers and guy I do vector and review too many damn shows
[01:54:35.540 --> 01:54:42.660]  okay remember yeah I wasn't gonna let you list them all but you can go ahead nope those are all
[01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:48.940]  good friends and those are all good shows you're you're I feel like back-to-back having Snellen
[01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:55.380]  and you I've got the two hardest working podcasters who still managed to write thousands of words a
[01:54:55.380 --> 01:55:03.140]  week back-to-back shows so I got to have somebody lazy on next week I'm so happy about Jason and his
[01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:07.380]  new site six colors and his new podcast upgrade it's because he's making a lot of content again
[01:55:07.380 --> 01:55:11.820]  and I love the content that he makes yeah there's just so much it's so funny because summer can be
[01:55:11.820 --> 01:55:18.140]  so slow and then all of a sudden so much happens and it's like the whole Mac world thing and the
[01:55:18.140 --> 01:55:22.820]  snow thing we could go on forever never even brought up the whole stupid markdown thing from
[01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:30.980]  two weeks ago never even mentioned it you and I hardly have even broached the the watch it's you
[01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:34.540]  know it's too much there's so much to talk about the next you know by the time we're done talking
[01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:42.220]  about it we'll be out there for the next event in October anyway Renee thank you so much talk to you
[01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:58.380]  soon
