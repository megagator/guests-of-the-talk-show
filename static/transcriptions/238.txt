[00:00.000 --> 00:01.600]  How are you, Jason?
[00:01.600 --> 00:05.600]  I'm doing good. I'm doing good. It's been a busy fall.
[00:05.600 --> 00:09.000]  Apple did a lot of stuff this fall. Kept, I think, all of us really busy.
[00:09.000 --> 00:13.200]  So it's kind of nice to almost relax a little bit at the end of the year.
[00:13.200 --> 00:14.800]  Yeah, I'm almost at that point.
[00:14.800 --> 00:17.300]  But I still have, like, a bunch of really good articles,
[00:17.300 --> 00:19.900]  or at least, I think, good articles that I've been meaning to write.
[00:19.900 --> 00:23.500]  And I really cannot believe that I may not get to them all by the end of the year.
[00:23.500 --> 00:27.100]  Like, I thought, this will be great. I want to write about this marzipan stuff.
[00:27.100 --> 00:34.800]  I have a couple of them, and they're all still in gestational form.
[00:34.800 --> 00:36.600]  But it's not for lack of work,
[00:36.600 --> 00:40.600]  and it's not for lack of other things that I've written about, et cetera.
[00:40.600 --> 00:42.500]  It's just a lot going on.
[00:42.500 --> 00:45.000]  Well, and Apple this year, and a little bit last year,
[00:45.000 --> 00:46.600]  they staggered all their releases, right?
[00:46.600 --> 00:49.000]  So you got one set of phones, and then the next phone,
[00:49.000 --> 00:54.400]  and then the iPads and the Macs, and it just was a very stretched out period.
[00:54.400 --> 00:59.800]  So there was, like, there's always something else happening right around the corner
[00:59.800 --> 01:02.400]  that, you know, required sometimes travel,
[01:02.400 --> 01:05.600]  sometimes spending a lot of time focusing on a particular product,
[01:05.600 --> 01:08.900]  and, right? And then, so you know this, that you end up with this.
[01:08.900 --> 01:12.200]  Just six weeks, eight weeks where you,
[01:12.200 --> 01:16.300]  your time kind of isn't your own because there's always another thing that's popping up.
[01:16.300 --> 01:22.200]  Yeah, totally. Let's lead with the news, the hot news,
[01:22.200 --> 01:27.700]  which may or may not be, it'll either be a totally different story by the time this podcast airs.
[01:27.700 --> 01:29.500]  We're recording on Friday, December 21st.
[01:29.500 --> 01:32.800]  I don't expect the show to air till Monday.
[01:32.800 --> 01:35.100]  So who knows what will happen over the weekend,
[01:35.100 --> 01:40.000]  but there's things I want to say about it that should hold up no matter what happens,
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.000]  but it's the new Ben Gate with iPad Pros.
[01:45.000 --> 01:48.100]  Oh, yeah. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
[01:48.100 --> 01:53.800]  So it started, I think, two days ago with a report at The Verge by Chris Welch,
[01:53.800 --> 01:59.100]  and the headline of the piece was,
[01:59.100 --> 02:05.400]  Apple confirms some iPad Pros ship slightly bent, comma,
[02:05.400 --> 02:08.900]  but says it's normal.
[02:08.900 --> 02:13.300]  And, you know, and he describes reports from people online,
[02:13.300 --> 02:17.000]  Mac rumors, forums, etc. People with some photographs of iPads
[02:17.000 --> 02:19.300]  that show a slight bend.
[02:19.300 --> 02:25.400]  And then he claims is the most intriguing part to me is he claims that he purchased a brand new one
[02:25.400 --> 02:28.600]  and in retail and out of the box,
[02:28.600 --> 02:30.800]  it was slightly bent, which, you know,
[02:30.800 --> 02:35.800]  and not to denigrate people who contribute to the fine forms at Mac rumors and other sites,
[02:35.800 --> 02:43.000]  but it's, you know, it's a lot more credible than when a byline staff writer at The Verge says he's seen it.
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.500]  The headline certainly didn't help. And he did talk to Apple,
[02:47.500 --> 02:52.500]  but he did not have a quote from Apple.
[02:52.500 --> 02:55.900]  You know, it's and you and I, you know, again, this is inside baseball,
[02:55.900 --> 02:58.100]  but I think it explains a lot is, you know,
[02:58.100 --> 03:01.200]  I speak to representatives at Apple PR frequently.
[03:01.200 --> 03:05.200]  I have spoken to them about this particular issue because I had some questions.
[03:05.200 --> 03:10.400]  And for the most part, when you speak to Apple PR, it is off the record.
[03:10.400 --> 03:15.400]  When you do get something from Apple on the record, it is, in my experience,
[03:15.400 --> 03:21.800]  always in the form of a very carefully written statement that they will email to you and tell you,
[03:21.800 --> 03:24.800]  you know, you can attribute this to an Apple spokesperson.
[03:24.800 --> 03:33.700]  And basically, they are extremely careful with their words and they want to get it in writing.
[03:33.700 --> 03:39.500]  And, you know, just extemporaneous conversations over the telephone or or whatever.
[03:39.500 --> 03:43.400]  They know, you know, people don't speak as carefully as as they do when writing.
[03:43.400 --> 03:47.700]  I mean, this this very podcast is evidence of the same phenomenon.
[03:47.700 --> 03:51.200]  Exactly. And so The Verge reached out.
[03:51.200 --> 03:57.800]  They obviously spoke to Apple. Apple said something that they that The Verge paraphrased as,
[03:57.800 --> 04:01.700]  you know, that this is that there's a slight bends are normal.
[04:01.700 --> 04:08.200]  You know, I have a feeling and I'm not trying to hold this against Chris Welch or The Verge or anybody.
[04:08.200 --> 04:13.200]  I have a feeling that they didn't use the word normal. None of the words were in quotes.
[04:13.200 --> 04:19.700]  I don't have any doubt that it's not an unreasonable paraphrasing of their summary.
[04:19.700 --> 04:25.700]  But I really, really doubt the paraphrasing that The Verge went with made Apple seem very flippant about the issue.
[04:25.700 --> 04:32.800]  And I don't I think people who read that were rightfully whether they have a bent iPad Pro or not.
[04:32.800 --> 04:37.200]  And we should, you know, get into is this actually a major problem or not.
[04:37.200 --> 04:43.400]  But even if you don't have a bent one, it certainly seems like an alarming attitude.
[04:43.400 --> 04:49.700]  Yeah, it's it's the it reminds me of back when Apple made its own displays
[04:49.700 --> 04:52.800]  and there was a certain number of dead pixels.
[04:52.800 --> 04:58.800]  Yes, that were allowable. And it was like literally you get a brand new display from Apple.
[04:58.800 --> 05:02.100]  You take it home and there'd be dead pixels.
[05:02.100 --> 05:04.900]  And I forget exactly what the policy was. It was a certain number
[05:04.900 --> 05:08.600]  or in a certain place or within a certain distance from one another.
[05:08.600 --> 05:17.500]  There was a whole thing. But in the end what that policy said was if we have dead pixels in a monitor you bought.
[05:17.500 --> 05:22.100]  It's fine. Even if you don't think it's fine. Trust us.
[05:22.100 --> 05:25.600]  It's fine. And we want we don't consider that a defect or you know,
[05:25.600 --> 05:32.700]  it's the it's like a or a discoloration or other some sort of like visible flaw that the
[05:32.700 --> 05:37.100]  and a company says we don't consider that a replaceable issue.
[05:37.100 --> 05:41.900]  It's just yeah. Sure. Some of them have weird flaws and you just have to deal with it,
[05:41.900 --> 05:44.700]  right? It's just for a for a premium product.
[05:44.700 --> 05:48.100]  You would think that the company's attitude should probably be
[05:48.100 --> 05:52.700]  if this makes you uncomfortable bring it back and we'll give you another one.
[05:52.700 --> 05:58.200]  And if they're not saying that part of me thinks that they have too many of these that are like this.
[05:58.200 --> 06:02.400]  But but it's just it's weird because nobody's really saying that it gets worse,
[06:02.400 --> 06:03.900]  right? It's part of the production process.
[06:03.900 --> 06:08.300]  So the question is is this something that they saw in the production process and we're like,
[06:08.300 --> 06:12.600]  yeah, it's fine. Nobody will notice because I can't believe anybody at Apple would ever say.
[06:12.600 --> 06:17.000]  Nobody will notice about anything ever because everything will be noticed.
[06:17.000 --> 06:23.800]  Yeah, and my conversation with some people at Apple PR yesterday was along those lines of that.
[06:23.800 --> 06:27.100]  They they don't think this is they definitely do not think this is a major issue.
[06:27.100 --> 06:30.400]  They think it's probably going to blow over.
[06:30.400 --> 06:33.200]  So I think this conversation is at this point.
[06:33.200 --> 06:37.700]  I think it I think it was worth having on the show to talk to you more about how Apple works
[06:37.700 --> 06:40.200]  and how these things work than this particular issue.
[06:40.200 --> 06:41.800]  We shall see kind of a time capsule.
[06:41.800 --> 06:44.000]  I also would I would also would not be surprised
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.300]  if the end result of this is Apple releases a statement saying
[06:46.300 --> 06:49.700]  if anybody gets something like this and they don't like it.
[06:49.700 --> 06:52.700]  We will replace it. Yeah, that's it.
[06:52.700 --> 06:56.700]  That would be the next level. So there is actually a the closest thing to a statement.
[06:56.700 --> 07:02.600]  I think so far somebody emailed Dan Riccio and got an email back
[07:02.600 --> 07:06.700]  and Mac rumors verified that it looks like it actually came from Dan Riccio.
[07:06.700 --> 07:09.700]  And here's here's what Dan Riccio said relative to the issue.
[07:09.700 --> 07:14.300]  You referenced regarding the new iPad Pro its unibody design meets
[07:14.300 --> 07:19.200]  or exceeds all of Apple's high quality standards of design and precision manufacturing.
[07:19.200 --> 07:20.800]  We've carefully engineered it
[07:20.800 --> 07:24.600]  and every part of the manufacturing process is priced precisely measured
[07:24.600 --> 07:27.200]  and controlled our current specification
[07:27.200 --> 07:31.600]  for iPad Pro flatness is up to 400 microns,
[07:31.600 --> 07:34.700]  which is even tighter than previous generations.
[07:34.700 --> 07:36.900]  I think that phrase is interesting.
[07:36.900 --> 07:40.700]  This 400 micron variance is less than half a millimeter
[07:40.700 --> 07:43.700]  or the width of fewer than four sheets of paper at most
[07:43.700 --> 07:49.600]  and this level of flatness won't change during normal use over the lifetime of the product note.
[07:49.600 --> 07:54.100]  These slight variations do not affect the function of the device
[07:54.100 --> 07:56.500]  in any way now,
[07:56.500 --> 08:03.400]  I actually have a statement from Apple PR that I haven't published a daring fireball,
[08:03.400 --> 08:05.300]  but it is Dan Riccio.
[08:05.300 --> 08:12.700]  Obviously is aware of their official statement because it is it is extremely close.
[08:13.900 --> 08:18.300]  But anyway for so the the thing that Riccio is saying is that the their tolerance
[08:18.300 --> 08:22.200]  for flatness on this iPad is is better higher tighter,
[08:22.200 --> 08:25.400]  whatever you want to say better than previous generations.
[08:25.400 --> 08:31.200]  So however big a variance 400 microns is and it the to normal scale.
[08:31.200 --> 08:35.700]  I looked it up 400 microns is point for 0.4 millimeters.
[08:35.700 --> 08:37.400]  So is that a lot? I don't see acid.
[08:37.400 --> 08:38.900]  This is the thing. I don't know. I don't know.
[08:38.900 --> 08:45.900]  Is that a lot like if you gave handed me a brand new iPad that had 400 microns of non flatness.
[08:45.900 --> 08:49.200]  Would I be able to would I pick it up and say hey this iPad is bent
[08:49.200 --> 08:55.500]  or is that the sort of thing that like maybe my iPad is bent a few hundred microns
[08:55.500 --> 08:57.500]  and I don't notice it. I don't know.
[08:57.500 --> 08:59.100]  Yeah, I have been sitting here.
[08:59.100 --> 09:02.300]  So I have an 11 and 12.9 iPad Pro sitting in front of me right now
[09:02.300 --> 09:05.400]  and I've been looking at them and honestly after a while.
[09:05.400 --> 09:08.600]  I can't tell like the optical illusion.
[09:08.600 --> 09:14.000]  I start to see bins that I think aren't there and this has to do with your focal length,
[09:14.000 --> 09:16.100]  you know, the focus of your eyes
[09:16.100 --> 09:19.300]  and where the stripes are on them like the cellular antennas
[09:19.300 --> 09:23.600]  and all of these things kind of feed in and then you kind of lose lose track.
[09:23.600 --> 09:28.600]  Although our friend Dr. Drang who is a an engineer
[09:28.600 --> 09:35.400]  and gets this stuff at a kind of a structural level did say to you today as devices get thinner
[09:35.400 --> 09:37.500]  every out of straightness becomes more noticeable
[09:37.500 --> 09:43.100]  and I think there's some interesting truth in that the idea that the the thickness of the device
[09:43.100 --> 09:51.000]  is so much less now that any deviation out of true is more is potentially more noticeable,
[09:51.000 --> 09:51.500]  right? I don't know.
[09:51.500 --> 09:53.400]  I mean you put these down.
[09:53.400 --> 09:57.300]  That's the thing about some of these visible bends that are in some of these photos on the internet
[09:57.300 --> 10:01.300]  is I look at that and I think that can't be that can't be 4 tenths of a millimeter,
[10:01.300 --> 10:03.700]  right bend that's got to be more than that.
[10:03.700 --> 10:06.600]  That's got to be the kind of thing where Apple should be like,
[10:06.600 --> 10:08.800]  yeah, we're that's that's not acceptable.
[10:08.800 --> 10:12.700]  It shouldn't have gotten out of our factory and we'll replace it for you.
[10:12.700 --> 10:15.200]  Yeah, that's what I think with some of the photos but again,
[10:15.200 --> 10:18.000]  I don't know, you know certainly seems like it
[10:18.000 --> 10:21.600]  but it is true that this is the thinnest iPad ever made.
[10:21.600 --> 10:23.000]  It's only five point.
[10:23.000 --> 10:29.800]  So, you know for scale 5.9 millimeters thick overall the camera bump is by my measurements
[10:29.800 --> 10:32.400]  with a handy-dandy little digital caliber.
[10:32.400 --> 10:36.400]  I bought this year, which is like seriously can't believe I didn't buy one before
[10:36.400 --> 10:41.200]  because it was only like 20 bucks is a little over 2 millimeters.
[10:41.200 --> 10:43.800]  I have it at like 2.1 millimeters,
[10:43.800 --> 10:45.500]  but you know 1 tenth of a millimeters,
[10:45.500 --> 10:50.200]  you know, who knows so we could even call it 2 millimeters
[10:50.200 --> 10:52.700]  but what they're saying is an out of variance
[10:52.700 --> 10:58.400]  or within within acceptable variance and flatness is like 1 fifth of the camera bump.
[10:58.400 --> 11:02.300]  I don't know that sounds like it could be noticeable.
[11:02.300 --> 11:03.700]  I don't know on a thin product.
[11:03.700 --> 11:10.400]  That's that's very long like the long side of the 12.9 model maybe but it is yeah,
[11:10.400 --> 11:11.700]  this is weird.
[11:11.700 --> 11:16.000]  One of the things I mean talk about taking it up to like how Apple does things
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  and that let looking at it at that level.
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.500]  This reminds me of some other stuff where there's an initial reaction
[11:21.500 --> 11:23.000]  and then there's some investigation
[11:23.000 --> 11:27.600]  and then there's obviously a policy conversation that happens inside of Apple
[11:27.600 --> 11:31.200]  and and then a PR conversation that happens inside of Apple
[11:31.200 --> 11:33.300]  and sometimes when Apple doesn't have a response.
[11:33.300 --> 11:38.100]  It's because they are formulating a response right there figuring it out
[11:38.100 --> 11:41.200]  and they don't want I remember with a couple of controversies in the past few years.
[11:41.200 --> 11:44.100]  I had those ongoing conversations with Apple where they're like,
[11:44.100 --> 11:47.600]  I don't have a statement for you yet or I've got this statement,
[11:47.600 --> 11:49.400]  but it's kind of wishy-washy and you know,
[11:49.400 --> 11:52.000]  we'll we'll work on the next one because yeah,
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.100]  it may be that they don't they haven't seen as many of these.
[11:55.100 --> 11:58.300]  They don't know that they know what they're allowed variances,
[11:58.300 --> 12:02.300]  but maybe there's some place where things that are more bendy are getting out.
[12:02.300 --> 12:07.700]  I think what's most interesting to me is the fact that that their attitude is that this is just a cosmetic defect
[12:07.700 --> 12:10.900]  and that it's not like it's not going to get worse.
[12:10.900 --> 12:15.700]  It's not that big a deal and that's good right because I think it's a much bigger story.
[12:15.700 --> 12:18.600]  If the if these things are bending in actual use
[12:18.600 --> 12:24.000]  and are going to break because then it's a it's a major problem for everybody who bought one.
[12:24.000 --> 12:29.600]  But if it's just that some of them are are have a cosmetic defect the probably the right thing to do though.
[12:29.600 --> 12:32.300]  If your Apple is to say yes,
[12:32.300 --> 12:36.300]  if you get one bring it back and we'll get you a one that isn't because that you know,
[12:36.300 --> 12:41.300]  if you can notice four tenths of a millimeter of variance
[12:41.300 --> 12:44.300]  or beyond then you shouldn't you know,
[12:44.300 --> 12:47.800]  we shouldn't make you look at that on your seven eight nine ten,
[12:47.800 --> 12:51.500]  you know thousand dollar product like it's just just we'll take it back.
[12:51.500 --> 12:52.700]  We want you to be happy. Yeah,
[12:52.700 --> 12:55.900]  and one of the things that ties into this story is
[12:55.900 --> 13:03.700]  and there's certainly a recurring theme of the last quarter of Apple products is the prices that they charge
[13:03.700 --> 13:04.600]  and that you have to pay.
[13:04.600 --> 13:07.500]  I mean the iPad Pro is a premium tablet.
[13:07.500 --> 13:09.500]  I mean, there's no question about it.
[13:09.500 --> 13:14.500]  And so that you know, the the a side of the argument is you know,
[13:14.500 --> 13:17.500]  just about whether the prices are too high or are they pricing themselves,
[13:17.500 --> 13:20.500]  you know pricing loyal customers out of their best products Etc.
[13:20.500 --> 13:22.500]  Etc. The B side though.
[13:22.500 --> 13:26.400]  Is it somebody who happily pays the price or even unhappily
[13:26.400 --> 13:31.800]  but pays it certainly has a reasonable expectation for the cost of an iPad
[13:31.800 --> 13:34.900]  Pro that they are going to be extremely pleased
[13:34.900 --> 13:37.600]  with the way that it looks as they take it out of the box.
[13:37.600 --> 13:39.700]  Absolutely 100% right.
[13:39.700 --> 13:41.600]  It's a pretty that comes back to it's a premium product.
[13:41.600 --> 13:44.900]  Apple is playing in the premium product game here.
[13:44.900 --> 13:48.800]  And if you it would be the same as if people discovered
[13:48.800 --> 13:54.600]  that sometimes the aluminum backs had weird blob blob colors on them of the wrong
[13:54.600 --> 13:58.400]  like the space gray got lighter or darker in patches
[13:58.400 --> 14:02.200]  and it was all patchy and and Apple be like that.
[14:02.200 --> 14:04.100]  It's fine. Like no, it's not fine.
[14:04.100 --> 14:07.400]  I paid a thousand dollars for this thing and you got blobs on the back
[14:07.400 --> 14:09.900]  and I don't care that it's part of your production process
[14:09.900 --> 14:15.800]  and that you've determined that this many shades of gray off of space gray is allowable
[14:15.800 --> 14:17.600]  and that it's not going to get any worse.
[14:17.600 --> 14:22.700]  Right? It's I paid a thousand dollars for a product that has ugly blobs on the back
[14:22.700 --> 14:24.800]  and that's not acceptable to me.
[14:24.800 --> 14:28.700]  Yeah, it's like when you buy a car to buy a new car
[14:28.700 --> 14:31.300]  and you do pick out the car and they wait
[14:31.300 --> 14:33.600]  and it comes and then the guy says, you know, your car is here
[14:33.600 --> 14:35.100]  and then you go to pick it up
[14:35.100 --> 14:39.200]  and then it's like you you like walk around the car
[14:39.200 --> 14:42.000]  and you double-check that, you know, I'd say it's a you know,
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.100]  a brand new car you walk around the car
[14:44.100 --> 14:47.800]  and you make sure everything is just right
[14:47.800 --> 14:50.000]  and then you sign off that everything's just right
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  that they sign off that everything's just right
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.200]  and you drive off the lot and then then, you know,
[14:55.200 --> 14:56.900]  stone hits your windshield or something like that
[14:56.900 --> 14:59.400]  and you get a mark or you know part, you know,
[14:59.400 --> 15:01.700]  you're in a parking lot that somebody dings your door,
[15:01.700 --> 15:04.700]  you know, that's that's life with a new car.
[15:04.700 --> 15:07.700]  But did you know you didn't you didn't get it like that?
[15:07.700 --> 15:11.000]  Right, right. There wasn't a bend in the door.
[15:11.000 --> 15:17.400]  Like Apple can't afford like a thousand dollar iPad isn't enough to justify that you get a
[15:17.400 --> 15:22.400]  let's verify that it's mint one-on-one with an Apple specialist as you buy it
[15:22.400 --> 15:28.000]  and a lot of us, you know, prefer to buy mail order rather than you know,
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.800]  you know, it's a lot easier just to listen for the doorbell than to go to the Apple store.
[15:31.800 --> 15:33.900]  So it doesn't quite scale to that sort of thing
[15:33.900 --> 15:35.700]  and the prices aren't quite commensurate, you know,
[15:35.700 --> 15:37.600]  a thousand dollar iPad is a lot for a tablet,
[15:37.600 --> 15:43.300]  but it's not a $40,000 car but it's on that spectrum.
[15:43.300 --> 15:48.000]  Like if you're $129 Chromebook has a one millimeter Bend.
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.700]  It's like well that's life with a hundred dollar plastic Chromebook.
[15:51.700 --> 15:53.700]  Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's yeah exactly right.
[15:53.700 --> 15:58.500]  Yeah, I'm going to scream bloody murder a lot less if I'm buying a $300 product
[15:58.500 --> 16:02.400]  than a thousand dollar product right here is Apple's official statement,
[16:02.400 --> 16:06.700]  which is very similar to what I read from Dan Riccio is the new iPad
[16:06.700 --> 16:11.600]  Pro with its gorgeous unibody design meets or exceeds all of Apple's high quality standards of design
[16:11.600 --> 16:13.400]  and precision manufacturing.
[16:13.400 --> 16:14.900]  We've carefully engineered it
[16:14.900 --> 16:18.900]  and every part of the manufacturing process is precisely measured
[16:18.900 --> 16:24.000]  and controlled our current specification for iPad Pro flatness is up to 400 microns,
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.100]  which is even tighter than previous generations.
[16:26.100 --> 16:30.600]  These slight variations do not affect the function of the device in any way.
[16:30.600 --> 16:38.400]  So you could see Dan Riccio was involved was familiar with the preparation of the official comment.
[16:38.400 --> 16:42.300]  I found it funny that he didn't include the opening line of the new iPad
[16:42.300 --> 16:46.900]  Pro with its gorgeous unibody design because a little salesmanship there.
[16:46.900 --> 16:49.500]  Yeah, it's like screw that I'm not selling this thing,
[16:49.500 --> 16:54.300]  but I'm going to you know, talk about the precision.
[16:54.300 --> 16:57.300]  So it does, you know, who knows that and again,
[16:57.300 --> 17:01.200]  to me the most interesting part of that is that it's a tighter tolerance than previous generations.
[17:01.200 --> 17:05.600]  And so who knows maybe there have been whatever is going on out there in the field with these things.
[17:05.600 --> 17:09.000]  Maybe it's been going on with iPads for 10 years
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.200]  and nobody really noticed
[17:11.200 --> 17:17.400]  because until it got this thin with these exact flat sides.
[17:17.400 --> 17:22.900]  It wasn't noticeable, you know, maybe that that that really interesting trick
[17:22.900 --> 17:31.300]  that they've been using for years to curve the aluminum on the back disguised a significant amount of non-flatness.
[17:31.300 --> 17:34.800]  Right and nobody noticed right and you throw in the
[17:34.800 --> 17:39.600]  the existence of a camera bump and then it's easy to wave things away as saying well,
[17:39.600 --> 17:44.200]  you know who can tell because there's this part that sticks out so I can't even tell.
[17:44.200 --> 17:49.600]  Yeah, it's I mean the idea that it's down from their previous standard is fascinating,
[17:49.600 --> 17:55.200]  right? So it's like it used to be more than maybe more than half a millimeter of bend in a run of aluminum.
[17:55.200 --> 17:57.900]  They'd be like, yeah, it's fine and and maybe nobody noticed
[17:57.900 --> 17:59.800]  and there's just something about this model.
[17:59.800 --> 18:05.400]  I'm still not entirely convinced that these photos that we're seeing are not items
[18:05.400 --> 18:09.500]  that are beyond Apple standard that somehow got out there I do that
[18:09.500 --> 18:12.500]  and that Apple is going to say yeah those those shouldn't be out there.
[18:12.500 --> 18:16.000]  And if you can see it and it's that big then you should get that replaced.
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.700]  That is a that's our failing on letting that out.
[18:18.700 --> 18:23.400]  Yeah, like maybe I don't know maybe you would think that if it bent in transit,
[18:23.400 --> 18:30.300]  you would notice a damaged box but like I presume that that with a lot of this stuff
[18:30.300 --> 18:33.000]  and I know with certain components they certainly do,
[18:33.000 --> 18:38.600]  you know, when they check the they've even bragged about it in their product marketing videos
[18:38.600 --> 18:40.700]  about the way that they automate,
[18:40.700 --> 18:44.700]  you know, the precision of verifying that the S this component meets our specs with,
[18:44.700 --> 18:48.100]  you know, fancy sensors and and stuff like that.
[18:48.100 --> 18:54.900]  I would just presume that the unibody aluminum is measured for preciseness elect,
[18:54.900 --> 18:57.100]  you know through a systematic way.
[18:57.100 --> 18:58.300]  Let's say not right,
[18:58.300 --> 19:01.200]  right not just there's actually a test it has to pass
[19:01.200 --> 19:03.400]  and the presumably they're testing all of them
[19:03.400 --> 19:07.000]  or at least or maybe then maybe not maybe they're testing samples
[19:07.000 --> 19:09.400]  and some can get through
[19:09.400 --> 19:13.300]  or it wasn't calibrated right because these are very fine measurements that are happening
[19:13.300 --> 19:15.200]  and some overly bent ones got through.
[19:15.200 --> 19:20.000]  I don't know. It's possibly because if she's on my mind because she just passed away Penny Marshall,
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.900]  but I think of the opening credits of Laverne and Shirley
[19:22.900 --> 19:29.100]  where they were inspecting bottles and she sticks a glove on the on the on the beat
[19:29.100 --> 19:32.800]  and it goes through the whole right assembly line right with her rubber glove on it.
[19:32.800 --> 19:38.100]  Yeah, there's just hundreds of iPads flying past two people who aren't really paying attention
[19:38.100 --> 19:42.100]  or it's that it's a I love Lucy sketch right where the where they're trying to take the candy
[19:42.100 --> 19:44.500]  and all that and it's just it's out of hand and yeah,
[19:44.500 --> 19:48.400]  yeah, that's it that people with the calipers are on the assembly line trying to measure the iPads.
[19:48.400 --> 19:51.400]  It's like there's too many iPads and then right.
[19:51.400 --> 19:54.300]  It takes like two minutes to measure to measure it correctly
[19:54.300 --> 19:58.200]  and yet they're coming by it like four per minute just like oh God,
[19:58.200 --> 20:00.500]  I'm going to get fired. They're good.
[20:00.500 --> 20:02.900]  You're good. It looks fine. That one didn't bend.
[20:02.900 --> 20:08.500]  It's fine. I don't know one thing to the other thing that's interesting when you you know,
[20:08.500 --> 20:13.600]  Apple the people at Apple PR and I think it I think it's a tremendous advantage
[20:13.600 --> 20:16.600]  that they have being a completely in-house team,
[20:16.600 --> 20:21.300]  you know, and I think one thing other people don't I think that the industry has sort of moved in Apple's way,
[20:21.300 --> 20:27.600]  but Apple was unique in that way for a long time where most tech companies used outside PR firms.
[20:27.600 --> 20:32.700]  Oh, yeah. I mean like we worked with what was a wagon or Edstrom was Microsoft's PR.
[20:32.700 --> 20:35.100]  Yeah, or Edelman and her was her.
[20:35.100 --> 20:39.100]  Well, well, yeah, so wag Ed was the PR firm for Microsoft forever for a long time
[20:39.100 --> 20:42.600]  and then Edelman they hired eventually to do the Mac PR,
[20:42.600 --> 20:46.500]  right, but it was like outside PR right like they would be
[20:46.500 --> 20:54.300]  and you'd have these back when I was at macworld like you'd have these three-way email exchanges
[20:54.300 --> 20:59.200]  where it was like a weird negotiation between you and the company
[20:59.200 --> 21:02.500]  and the PR person which is like yeah,
[21:02.500 --> 21:06.200]  right. Whereas with Apple it was always my entire time dealing with Apple.
[21:06.200 --> 21:11.500]  There was always inside PR at Apple like that was that was who you dealt with you didn't deal with outside PR.
[21:11.500 --> 21:19.000]  Yeah. Well one of the reasons that it's an advantage for them is it just clarity of communication.
[21:19.000 --> 21:22.400]  But the other thing is that and this has happened before like,
[21:22.400 --> 21:27.200]  you know, these little mini I don't even want to call them scandals kerfuffles,
[21:27.200 --> 21:28.700]  you know, it's certainly not a scandal yet,
[21:28.700 --> 21:34.100]  but hubbubz whatever you want to call them they you know,
[21:34.100 --> 21:36.100]  part of the reason that they're like we're on it.
[21:36.100 --> 21:37.300]  We're looking into it wait,
[21:37.300 --> 21:44.100]  but they do things and they can do things like check with retail and say is this,
[21:44.100 --> 21:51.700]  you know, are you guys seeing a an unusual number of complaints of customers with new iPad Pros
[21:51.700 --> 21:54.200]  with a bend, you know, what's going on?
[21:54.200 --> 21:57.300]  Like they they they're not just guessing,
[21:57.300 --> 22:01.400]  you know, they actually go and double check is is there like an issue
[22:01.400 --> 22:06.600]  that should have raised a red flag that we haven't noticed in the data of you know,
[22:06.600 --> 22:12.000]  the aggregate issues coming into the Genius Bar and I was told no there is at you know,
[22:12.000 --> 22:20.300]  there's absolutely nothing unusual in their support increase regarding recent purchasers of iPad Pros.
[22:20.300 --> 22:21.600]  So I don't know what's going on.
[22:21.600 --> 22:24.600]  Well, the problem I say this every time there's a gate,
[22:24.600 --> 22:36.100]  right the problem is that anecdotal anecdotes and it's not even anecdotal evidence anecdotes posted on the internet are very hard to gauge
[22:36.100 --> 22:42.600]  whether it's point oh one percent point one percent one percent
[22:42.600 --> 22:48.200]  or 10% of products that are that are experiencing any given failure
[22:48.200 --> 22:50.300]  and Apple ships so many especially of iPhones,
[22:50.300 --> 22:54.600]  which is when the gates usually happen right the gates open when an iPhone is released.
[22:54.600 --> 22:59.100]  There's so many iPhones that are sold that even if it's point oh one percent.
[22:59.100 --> 23:04.800]  There could be thousands of of lemons that Apple has produced
[23:04.800 --> 23:07.000]  so that it can be it's a tough game.
[23:07.000 --> 23:10.600]  Like if you produce even a tiny number of lemons percentage-wise
[23:10.600 --> 23:12.800]  and it's a huge product you you know,
[23:12.800 --> 23:14.400]  there are bad phones that are getting out there.
[23:14.400 --> 23:22.500]  So for the iPad, this is one of those examples where it's like are there 10 weird bendy iPads out there
[23:22.500 --> 23:27.100]  and one of them happened to go to a Mac rumors reader are there a thousand
[23:27.100 --> 23:31.600]  but only five people have noticed are there 10,000 like that?
[23:31.600 --> 23:33.700]  I don't know like there's no real way to know
[23:33.700 --> 23:37.400]  and and you can react and poo-poo it and say but it's probably not a problem
[23:37.400 --> 23:40.200]  or you can freak out and say oh my God all the iPads are bent.
[23:40.200 --> 23:48.000]  But the truth is somewhere in this range that is an uncomfortably wide range of it being incredibly minor
[23:48.000 --> 23:52.000]  and the end of the world and it's hard to tell
[23:52.000 --> 23:55.800]  because the internet magnifies if somebody finds something wrong with an Apple product
[23:55.800 --> 23:58.700]  in terms of its manufacturer and post it on the internet.
[23:58.700 --> 24:03.500]  It will get amplified right it will become the next potential scandal
[24:03.500 --> 24:09.000]  or you know what it is is that the internet makes something possible that would have been impossible
[24:09.000 --> 24:13.200]  when you and I were kids is that it allows these people to find each other,
[24:13.200 --> 24:17.000]  right? So if it is if there are you know,
[24:17.000 --> 24:24.000]  50 people who've received truly defective bent iPad pros and they're like upset about it
[24:24.000 --> 24:29.700]  and they start Googling 2018 iPad Pro shipped bent.
[24:29.700 --> 24:32.500]  They are going to find each other like a query,
[24:32.500 --> 24:38.200]  you know, like you don't have to be everybody's kind of gotten good at Googling right,
[24:38.200 --> 24:41.400]  you know, right and also then you places,
[24:41.400 --> 24:45.200]  you know, you can go like that people go to Mac rumors or people go to the Apple discussion forums.
[24:45.200 --> 24:47.600]  Like there are certain places that people or you go.
[24:47.600 --> 24:49.900]  There's a lot of these things not necessarily for Apple,
[24:49.900 --> 24:51.800]  but in general come out of Reddit,
[24:51.800 --> 24:54.300]  right because somebody just posts in an interest group
[24:54.300 --> 24:57.300]  in Reddit about the product that they have a problem with
[24:57.300 --> 25:01.100]  and it kind of goes goes viral which is the that's the trick right is like
[25:01.100 --> 25:04.200]  if it's the right person with the bad product
[25:04.200 --> 25:08.200]  and there's literally only one it still can get magnified
[25:08.200 --> 25:15.200]  or if there are literally only five but there could be 10,000 like you just can't tell.
[25:15.200 --> 25:17.900]  All right, let me take a break and thank our first sponsor.
[25:17.900 --> 25:20.600]  It's Linode now. I've been pronouncing it Linode
[25:20.600 --> 25:25.400]  and I know it's a running gag on the show that I pronounce things wrong,
[25:25.400 --> 25:29.000]  but I've been informed not by them. They haven't complained,
[25:29.000 --> 25:32.400]  but I've been formed by several people out there in the show that I should be pronouncing it.
[25:32.400 --> 25:37.200]  Linode and the same way that Linux is is not Linux.
[25:37.200 --> 25:41.100]  I'm with you. I had a line out server for like 10 years
[25:41.100 --> 25:42.500]  and then I got the ad copy
[25:42.500 --> 25:46.100]  and I discovered that somebody somebody said it's pronounced like Linux.
[25:46.100 --> 25:51.000]  It was actually in my ad copy for whoever was like Lex Friedman or somebody put it in there
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.600]  and I was like, oh like I had no idea.
[25:53.600 --> 25:57.800]  You know what? I'm going to make that a New Year's resolution for 2019 that I'm going to need.
[25:57.800 --> 26:00.800]  I need all of my ad reads spelled out phonetically.
[26:00.800 --> 26:03.800]  Just assume I'm going to pronounce everything wrong.
[26:03.800 --> 26:07.300]  It certainly looks like Linode. It certainly makes sense
[26:07.300 --> 26:11.100]  because of the Linux thing that it would be pronounced Linode instead.
[26:11.100 --> 26:13.900]  Either way, it is a tremendous hosting service.
[26:13.900 --> 26:15.600]  So you can pronounce it however you want.
[26:15.600 --> 26:19.700]  It's L-I-N-O-D-E and they allow you to deploy
[26:19.700 --> 26:23.200]  and manage an SSD server in their Linode cloud
[26:23.200 --> 26:26.000]  and you can get a server running in seconds.
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.100]  Literally they say like 30 seconds. You can just have a new server instance up
[26:30.100 --> 26:35.000]  and running with your choice of Linux distribution resources
[26:35.000 --> 26:41.000]  and node location. They've got 10 10 data centers worldwide.
[26:41.000 --> 26:44.500]  So if you if the actual physical location of your data center
[26:44.500 --> 26:48.600]  and that ping times to other resources in a region matter to you,
[26:48.600 --> 26:52.900]  they've they've got them spread all around the globe literally.
[26:52.900 --> 27:00.100]  Plans start at 1 gig of RAM for your instance for just $5 a month.
[27:00.100 --> 27:04.100]  That's just tremendous. And they've got a special deal for talk show listeners.
[27:04.100 --> 27:07.600]  You get $20 credit with the code I'll tell you at the end.
[27:07.600 --> 27:11.400]  So that means you could get a server for four months with the code.
[27:11.400 --> 27:18.100]  It's crazy. Four months of like a top tier world-class SSD server.
[27:18.100 --> 27:21.000]  You can configure your memory as much as you want.
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.900]  They've got high memory plans that start at 16 gigabytes.
[27:23.900 --> 27:27.900]  If you need more, you can get more. Seven day money back guarantee.
[27:27.900 --> 27:32.500]  So if you cough up the money you get started. Something about it makes you unhappy.
[27:32.500 --> 27:34.200]  You have seven days to get all of your money back.
[27:34.200 --> 27:37.400]  That's how confident they are. And they really do.
[27:37.400 --> 27:40.200]  They really do allow you to get a new server instance up
[27:40.200 --> 27:44.000]  and running just by clicking a few buttons. It's super easy super quick.
[27:44.000 --> 27:50.500]  They have a great great interface for managing all of this stuff.
[27:50.500 --> 27:55.200]  Just a great dashboard interface. Hourly billing with a monthly cap on all plans.
[27:55.200 --> 27:57.100]  So you won't get surprised if something happens.
[27:57.100 --> 28:01.400]  You're not going to unexpectedly get a huge bill. Native SSD surge.
[28:01.400 --> 28:05.000]  That's really important. I know that's the way the whole world's going.
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.500]  But you don't want to have an important server running with a spinning hard drive.
[28:07.500 --> 28:12.600]  That's that's irresponsible. Go SSD all the way.
[28:12.600 --> 28:15.400]  Anyway, that's that's it's it's just a great service.
[28:15.400 --> 28:18.200]  I paid for it. It is it is actually what I use.
[28:18.200 --> 28:21.300]  I would endorse them even if they weren't sponsoring the show.
[28:21.300 --> 28:26.900]  That's their great company with a tremendous reputation and a great support team.
[28:26.900 --> 28:31.200]  And they're hiring so you can go to linode.com slash careers.
[28:31.200 --> 28:33.600]  If you are the sort of person who works in a field
[28:33.600 --> 28:37.200]  where you might work for a hosting company,
[28:37.200 --> 28:41.200]  you know programming network administration that sort of thing.
[28:41.200 --> 28:45.100]  They're doing so well. They're hiring. So go check out linode.com slash careers.
[28:45.100 --> 28:48.800]  If you're looking for work. And anyway, here's the deal.
[28:48.800 --> 28:56.300]  20 buck credit for everybody who listens to the show by going to linode.com slash the talk show.
[28:56.300 --> 28:59.300]  And then the promo code. That's not quite enough.
[28:59.300 --> 29:03.900]  The promo code you got to remember is talk show 2018.
[29:03.900 --> 29:08.500]  Ta lk sh ow 2018. My thanks to Linode.
[29:08.500 --> 29:15.600]  Great sponsor. Great company. I sold t-shirts last week.
[29:15.600 --> 29:19.400]  I saw that. Hoodies too. Everybody's getting them.
[29:19.400 --> 29:23.700]  It's always exciting to me. The part where you're selling them is more.
[29:23.700 --> 29:26.000]  I mean, it's nice and you know,
[29:26.000 --> 29:31.100]  like I have my little email set up to like it's a trick I learned from Jim Kudol like it.
[29:31.100 --> 29:33.300]  I don't know if they still do it because Field Notes has gotten so big
[29:33.300 --> 29:35.800]  but Kudol had a thing set up at Field Notes
[29:35.800 --> 29:38.300]  so that when everybody whenever somebody bought Field Notes,
[29:38.300 --> 29:41.400]  it played its specific sound.
[29:41.400 --> 29:42.800]  I think it was just a simple mail filter,
[29:42.800 --> 29:49.400]  but it's like that sound was one thing and one thing only which was a sale of Field Notes.
[29:49.400 --> 29:51.300]  And so I have that set up for the t-shirts
[29:51.300 --> 29:54.000]  and it's nice you hear ding ding at least people are buying them,
[29:54.000 --> 29:57.000]  you know, but to me the fun part is when people start getting them on Twitter
[29:57.000 --> 30:02.000]  and they start posting pictures of wearing them or doing them.
[30:02.000 --> 30:04.000]  I did stickers this time for the first time.
[30:04.000 --> 30:08.200]  I don't know. Wow. I need to start moving faster. Jason.
[30:08.200 --> 30:13.300]  I think I feel like 2018 is way too long to love to love stickers.
[30:13.300 --> 30:16.200]  They love them. Yeah people like pins to apparently,
[30:16.200 --> 30:18.400]  but I've never done the pins. I never got pins,
[30:18.400 --> 30:21.200]  but I started doing pins last year and people love pins too.
[30:21.200 --> 30:23.400]  So it's one of those things where you got to get outside yourself
[30:23.400 --> 30:26.700]  and say I don't particularly do a lot of stickers or pin people love them.
[30:26.700 --> 30:28.600]  And and that's fine and the t-shirts.
[30:28.600 --> 30:32.200]  Yeah, we did we just did our a bunch of stuff are uncomfortable
[30:32.200 --> 30:34.000]  and relay and all that like everybody's doing the merch
[30:34.000 --> 30:36.000]  because it's the holidays and all of that.
[30:36.000 --> 30:38.200]  It is fun to see those pictures coming on Twitter
[30:38.200 --> 30:40.400]  and I'm jealous because I haven't gotten mine yet.
[30:40.400 --> 30:43.500]  So I'm seeing other people with them before I get my you know,
[30:43.500 --> 30:48.200]  my incomparable pin or my Mike and I did a dongle town t-shirt this year,
[30:48.200 --> 30:53.000]  which is in the style of like the Hollister California care,
[30:53.000 --> 30:55.100]  you know those kind of t-shirts. Yeah,
[30:55.100 --> 31:00.200]  but it's for dongle town and suddenly USB-C port and says Port Authority on it.
[31:00.200 --> 31:02.800]  Yeah, that's good. That's very funny.
[31:02.800 --> 31:05.000]  So I'm looking forward to getting my dongle town shirt
[31:05.000 --> 31:10.300]  and mystify everybody in in my town who doesn't understand computers dongle town.
[31:10.300 --> 31:17.200]  Port Authority would be a not bad name for like the store at the airport where you buy,
[31:17.200 --> 31:20.400]  you know, yeah, you know that story at the coup at the Cupertino Airport.
[31:20.400 --> 31:22.200]  There's a dongle town Port Authority right,
[31:22.200 --> 31:24.000]  you know the store for you know,
[31:24.000 --> 31:26.400]  you forgot your USB charger actually.
[31:26.400 --> 31:29.900]  Oh, man, we should get get on trademarking that I know it'll be that the place you go
[31:29.900 --> 31:32.400]  for all your adapters or maybe it's just like a little vending machine
[31:32.400 --> 31:33.700]  or something for all your adapters.
[31:33.700 --> 31:36.100]  I realize switching to the iPad Pro.
[31:36.100 --> 31:38.400]  I now have I already was embarrassed
[31:38.400 --> 31:41.500]  because I have a pair of wired headphones that I love that.
[31:41.500 --> 31:45.100]  I have a carry around in a little little carrying case
[31:45.100 --> 31:51.900]  and I always felt bad because I had the little white lightning to headphone jack adapter in there.
[31:51.900 --> 31:58.200]  And now now I also have the little white lightning to USB-C adapter.
[31:58.200 --> 32:00.900]  So I have to choose and the other day I was working
[32:00.900 --> 32:02.900]  and I was listening to something on my iPhone
[32:02.900 --> 32:05.500]  and then I realized I need to hear something on my iPad instead
[32:05.500 --> 32:08.400]  and I had to do like a switch the little white dongles
[32:08.400 --> 32:10.700]  and I thought boy it's come to this
[32:10.700 --> 32:14.900]  but I don't want to give up the the wired headphones just yet.
[32:14.900 --> 32:17.900]  So I use AirPods a lot but for some stuff,
[32:17.900 --> 32:21.100]  especially if I'm in a noisy environment and I want to block other people out.
[32:21.100 --> 32:25.900]  There's a lady at my Starbucks that I go to who who's there all day
[32:25.900 --> 32:28.400]  and is lonely and will talk to you
[32:28.400 --> 32:31.500]  and I have to block her out because otherwise she'll talk to me.
[32:31.500 --> 32:33.000]  So this is my sad story.
[32:33.000 --> 32:35.500]  But anyway, I've got two dongles now in my little carrying case.
[32:35.500 --> 32:36.900]  It's great. Yeah, you know what?
[32:36.900 --> 32:39.800]  That's the main reason that I did the stickers.
[32:39.800 --> 32:41.600]  Well a I've been thinking about it for years,
[32:41.600 --> 32:43.500]  but I actually want one now myself.
[32:43.500 --> 32:47.800]  I made I made three inch stickers which seem like a standard size for circular stickers,
[32:47.800 --> 32:49.100]  but I also made one inch ones
[32:49.100 --> 32:51.900]  and I want the one inch one to put on my AirPods case
[32:51.900 --> 32:54.400]  because now we're up to three AirPod users in the house.
[32:54.400 --> 32:58.900]  Yeah, and that was the breaking point of who the hell's AirPods are these.
[32:58.900 --> 33:01.500]  And so I'm actually is to be like the first Apple product.
[33:01.500 --> 33:04.500]  I can recall that I actually want to put a sticker on you know,
[33:04.500 --> 33:07.200]  the one that I because I am not a big sticker person.
[33:07.200 --> 33:11.300]  I have at some point I decided I was going to for my personal kind of
[33:11.300 --> 33:13.000]  because of six colors.com.
[33:13.000 --> 33:18.300]  I got rainbow Apple logos in the exact size of the Apple logos on like my laptop
[33:18.300 --> 33:21.800]  and my iPad and my iMac and I got those and put them on
[33:21.800 --> 33:24.600]  and I thought like that's fitting but it's literally in the space
[33:24.600 --> 33:26.100]  where the Apple logo already was.
[33:26.100 --> 33:27.700]  I'm just sort of colorizing it right.
[33:27.700 --> 33:33.900]  I've never been a you know slather stickers all over my Apple products kind of thing.
[33:33.900 --> 33:44.900]  But this this folio case for the iPad Pro with that giant gray completely blank expanse.
[33:44.900 --> 33:48.000]  I actually have started putting stickers on it because I just can't take it.
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.500]  It's it's the most boring accessory Apple has ever made
[33:51.500 --> 33:55.200]  and I've just decided that I need to also to help orient like I know which side is
[33:55.200 --> 33:59.200]  which because of the stickers and stuff and it's just so that's the first one for me.
[33:59.200 --> 34:01.600]  I do have a sticker on my AirPods case
[34:01.600 --> 34:06.200]  because we have two sets in the house and you can tell them apart but it's essential
[34:06.200 --> 34:09.000]  and but that's is what I thought as I thought about what then I started thinking.
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.900]  Well, what sticker and I add because I'm not a sticker person.
[34:11.900 --> 34:16.600]  I didn't have any stickers laying around be most stickers are a little too big,
[34:16.600 --> 34:18.900]  you know pods cases tiny and then I thought well,
[34:18.900 --> 34:22.300]  wait a minute. I I could put my own sticker on there.
[34:22.300 --> 34:25.500]  Yeah little so I assume it's just the during fireball star.
[34:25.500 --> 34:31.800]  Yeah, it's just a circle that is hopefully very close to the correct shade of gray
[34:31.800 --> 34:33.200]  with a white star in the middle.
[34:33.200 --> 34:34.700]  Nice. I haven't seen him in person yet.
[34:34.700 --> 34:35.900]  That's the one of the weird things
[34:35.900 --> 34:42.300]  because the ship the shirts ship from my longtime partner in crime in the t-shirt racket.
[34:42.300 --> 34:44.600]  Brian Jeremy out in Southern California.
[34:44.600 --> 34:47.400]  So I had the stickers sent to him to which kind of hurt
[34:47.400 --> 34:49.200]  because I wanted to see them.
[34:49.200 --> 34:52.300]  Yeah, I just did that because all of our stickers went through Cotton Bureau in Pittsburgh.
[34:52.300 --> 34:55.800]  And so I just had the I had all of the stickers shipped to Pittsburgh.
[34:55.800 --> 34:57.200]  So I don't know like that day.
[34:57.200 --> 35:02.400]  I like the good thing is I trust Brian's eye like Brian knows during fireball brand
[35:02.400 --> 35:07.800]  and he's very very accurate judge of color and you know and and things like,
[35:07.800 --> 35:09.100]  you know, are they cut right and stuff?
[35:09.100 --> 35:12.000]  I mean sure company I got him from a place called sticker mule.
[35:12.000 --> 35:13.600]  I don't know. Yeah, I've used them.
[35:13.600 --> 35:17.500]  I've used them absolutely but they seem to have a very good reputation
[35:17.500 --> 35:22.100]  and was a very nice process actually setting it up.
[35:22.100 --> 35:28.400]  Those places are really designed at this point to mitigate against having you demand your money back.
[35:28.400 --> 35:31.400]  So they like go through like a proof process and they send you the proof
[35:31.400 --> 35:32.800]  and I've actually been really happy with that
[35:32.800 --> 35:37.500]  because I'll sometimes I'll oftentimes like three out of four will be fine
[35:37.500 --> 35:40.100]  and then there'll be one out of four that I'll give them a little feedback
[35:40.100 --> 35:42.300]  and say that's not what I was thinking often,
[35:42.300 --> 35:45.000]  you know, 24 hours. Sometimes it's like five hours.
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.200]  They send back a second proof. I'm like that's exactly it.
[35:47.200 --> 35:50.000]  And so they're pretty good. I've been pretty impressed.
[35:50.000 --> 35:53.200]  Yeah, I forget what my issue was. I had a very small issue.
[35:53.200 --> 35:55.400]  I you know what it was. It wasn't even that their proof.
[35:55.400 --> 35:58.600]  It wasn't that the proof they showed me showed any signs of defect.
[35:58.600 --> 36:02.200]  It was when I used to be so involved in the print world
[36:02.200 --> 36:05.800]  because I used to do print design and I knew you know,
[36:05.800 --> 36:07.400]  what do we used to call pre-flight remember?
[36:07.400 --> 36:10.600]  We'd you'd pre-flight right your Quark Express file
[36:10.600 --> 36:14.100]  and there was what was the there was a great app.
[36:14.100 --> 36:17.700]  Oh man pre-flight was it named pre-flight
[36:17.700 --> 36:22.200]  and what you could do is just you get your Quark Express document.
[36:22.200 --> 36:26.900]  If you had images those images were external files somewhere else
[36:26.900 --> 36:29.100]  and they were referenced within the document,
[36:29.100 --> 36:33.100]  you know, it's it's not at all dissimilar to the concept of an HTML file
[36:33.100 --> 36:35.900]  where the image isn't actually in the HTML file the image,
[36:35.900 --> 36:39.600]  you know, it's the document contains a reference to it
[36:39.600 --> 36:42.200]  and what you could do with pre-flight is when you were done.
[36:42.200 --> 36:45.000]  You just drag your Quark file onto this app
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.800]  and it would grab everything make a copy of it
[36:47.800 --> 36:50.300]  and like put it in a I was going to say zip archive,
[36:50.300 --> 36:54.800]  but it's probably like a sit file right like a stuff it archive
[36:54.800 --> 36:59.400]  and then you'd have just one stuff it archive that you could give to the print shop
[36:59.400 --> 37:02.200]  and then they could stuff it and everything would be there
[37:02.200 --> 37:05.300]  and including like the fonts you'd have everything you need.
[37:05.300 --> 37:08.000]  You'd have the fonts you'd have the images.
[37:08.000 --> 37:09.400]  I'm so out of the game that I don't know
[37:09.400 --> 37:10.400]  how you ship stuff anymore.
[37:10.400 --> 37:12.100]  I don't know what is EPS what you want
[37:12.100 --> 37:15.500]  and and Sticker Mule took all sorts of you know,
[37:15.500 --> 37:17.600]  any file you can imagine you should send them a PDF.
[37:17.600 --> 37:18.700]  You could send them an EPS.
[37:18.700 --> 37:22.600]  You could send them you know raster files,
[37:22.600 --> 37:23.700]  which I know I just not you know,
[37:23.700 --> 37:25.200]  not the best way to do it,
[37:25.200 --> 37:31.000]  but I I send SVG and I because I think that's the most modern way to do it
[37:31.000 --> 37:34.100]  and I think it's the most precise way to specify a color
[37:34.100 --> 37:35.100]  but I could I could be wrong.
[37:35.100 --> 37:37.900]  Maybe I'll be inundated with feedback this week that I was an idiot
[37:37.900 --> 37:40.100]  that SVG is terrible,
[37:40.100 --> 37:42.100]  but I got what I did is I sent them
[37:42.100 --> 37:46.600]  and of course I'd put this off till close to the last minute,
[37:46.600 --> 37:48.400]  but I think I sent them a PDF at first
[37:48.400 --> 37:49.700]  and then they showed me the proof
[37:49.700 --> 37:51.100]  and I didn't really like the color.
[37:51.100 --> 37:54.300]  I don't think I don't think they did anything wrong.
[37:54.300 --> 37:55.200]  I just wasn't sure
[37:55.200 --> 38:01.900]  and I know from past experience sometimes PDF doesn't round trip that well with color.
[38:01.900 --> 38:07.400]  So anyway, I switched to SVG and they seemingly came out perfect.
[38:07.400 --> 38:09.900]  Enjoying any any beverages as we record.
[38:09.900 --> 38:13.400]  I ran out of beverages on the I have a like the teapot,
[38:13.400 --> 38:15.200]  but the teapot was drained.
[38:15.200 --> 38:17.800]  So I'm I'm tea less now,
[38:17.800 --> 38:20.700]  but you know me I may go get something during an ad break.
[38:20.700 --> 38:23.100]  It's possible. I have some coffee in there.
[38:23.100 --> 38:27.600]  Of course homemade fizzy water the problem with the with the tea in my house.
[38:27.600 --> 38:30.400]  Now is that my daughter has become a tea drinker
[38:30.400 --> 38:34.200]  and so that teapot gets empty at unexpected times.
[38:34.200 --> 38:37.800]  And then I'm like and then it's too late.
[38:37.800 --> 38:39.500]  Like it's like I'm not going to make another pot of tea.
[38:39.500 --> 38:41.700]  It's just it's over for them.
[38:41.700 --> 38:43.200]  Sometimes I'll go back and make another pot,
[38:43.200 --> 38:45.200]  but sometimes not.
[38:45.200 --> 38:47.100]  All right, here's here's the one of the main things
[38:47.100 --> 38:48.800]  and it's one of my recurring themes.
[38:48.800 --> 38:53.200]  I can't stop thinking about it is this whole notion.
[38:53.200 --> 39:00.000]  Speaking of iPad pros of using an iPad Pro for quote-unquote work
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.000]  and you fascinate me of all the other all the people.
[39:04.000 --> 39:08.800]  No all the people in this racket all of our friends colleagues.
[39:08.800 --> 39:10.300]  Everybody or you know,
[39:10.300 --> 39:12.800]  even people we don't like but who were right about this stuff
[39:12.800 --> 39:17.400]  and I have various positions all over the map on where the iPad
[39:17.400 --> 39:20.900]  and the iPad Pro probably in particular stand visit,
[39:20.900 --> 39:24.700]  you know compared to the Mac as a machine for work
[39:24.700 --> 39:31.300]  and you fascinating me because you and I are like-minded of similar age
[39:31.300 --> 39:35.600]  and you know, we do kind of the same thing like mostly writing
[39:35.600 --> 39:38.500]  and reading and linking to things.
[39:38.500 --> 39:42.100]  We are both longtime fans of some of the same apps.
[39:42.100 --> 39:44.700]  Like I'll just say in particular BB Edit.
[39:44.700 --> 39:49.100]  Sure, which just amazingly celebrated its 25th anniversary.
[39:49.100 --> 39:51.900]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[39:51.900 --> 39:54.600]  Well, it's both crazy because that sounds like a long time for an app.
[39:54.600 --> 39:56.900]  Like who thinks of apps being around for 25 years
[39:56.900 --> 39:58.700]  and then on the other hand, I can't remember.
[39:58.700 --> 40:03.000]  Well, I do remember before BB Edit but it was,
[40:03.000 --> 40:04.900]  you know, I was like a sophomore in college
[40:04.900 --> 40:06.600]  when I first started using BB Edit
[40:06.600 --> 40:10.600]  and that feels like yeah, that's a long time ago.
[40:10.600 --> 40:11.200]  Yeah, totally.
[40:11.200 --> 40:13.200]  And for me it was a it was my first job
[40:13.200 --> 40:16.400]  that the there was a guy there who was like you should use BB Edit.
[40:16.400 --> 40:19.100]  I was like, okay and that was it.
[40:19.100 --> 40:20.600]  I could be off by a year.
[40:20.600 --> 40:23.600]  I'm 99% sure that was 1992.
[40:23.600 --> 40:27.900]  And I remember where I was I was in the tower dormitory.
[40:27.900 --> 40:29.300]  They used to call the new tower.
[40:29.300 --> 40:33.500]  That's how creatively Drexel University named named its dormitory.
[40:33.500 --> 40:35.800]  They've gotten a lot better than recent years like it
[40:35.800 --> 40:37.700]  because you know the way the game really works
[40:37.700 --> 40:44.900]  is you find some deep-pocketed alumni who wants the name on a building.
[40:44.900 --> 40:49.600]  In the 80s Drexel was it wasn't on top of that game
[40:49.600 --> 40:53.700]  and there was a dormitory called the new tower.
[40:53.700 --> 40:55.700]  Which I wonder I actually have no idea.
[40:55.700 --> 40:56.600]  I should look it up.
[40:56.600 --> 40:57.900]  But I wonder if they still call it that
[40:57.900 --> 40:59.200]  because it certainly isn't new anymore.
[40:59.200 --> 40:59.700]  It would be.
[40:59.700 --> 41:01.900]  Yeah, they might have they might have sold the naming rights for that too.
[41:01.900 --> 41:04.600]  That happened when they built the new Warriors Arena in Oakland.
[41:04.600 --> 41:05.800]  They're that they're now going to leave.
[41:05.800 --> 41:10.900]  It was it was the new arena for a long time before Oracle paid up to get the name.
[41:10.900 --> 41:15.800]  Yeah, I was in my friend Dave super his name is super Dave.
[41:15.800 --> 41:18.700]  We had big Dave and super Dave super Dave's dorm room.
[41:18.700 --> 41:21.300]  Super Dave ran a excellent bulletin board.
[41:21.300 --> 41:24.100]  That was that was before you know,
[41:24.100 --> 41:25.900]  that was how we communicated with each other.
[41:25.900 --> 41:30.000]  I feel like we're getting older by the minute as you tell the story.
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.700]  I even remember what model computer he had a Mac hit it.
[41:32.700 --> 41:33.200]  Excellent.
[41:33.200 --> 41:37.200]  He had a Mac to CI which we go down memory lane is in my opinion.
[41:37.200 --> 41:41.800]  One of the greatest Macintosh has ever made totally as far outside my family's budget,
[41:41.800 --> 41:47.800]  but it started life when it was new as a like one of the very very top-end Mac twos
[41:47.800 --> 41:54.100]  and it remained in Apple's lineup for years to come as it sort of it was actually Apple didn't do this at the time.
[41:54.100 --> 42:01.100]  It was sort of what Apple does now is allow a formerly top-line product to work its way down the lineup,
[42:01.100 --> 42:05.600]  you know the way that you can still go into an Apple store and buy like an iPhone success,
[42:05.600 --> 42:07.900]  you know, the to CI had that sort of life.
[42:07.900 --> 42:16.600]  Anyway, Dave was on as a Mac to CI and I wasn't even wanting to pay it wasn't like here come here and look at this.
[42:16.600 --> 42:17.800]  I was like, oh my god, what's that?
[42:17.800 --> 42:18.600]  What is that?
[42:18.600 --> 42:22.000]  And he was like, oh, it's some new text editor called BB edit and I was like,
[42:22.000 --> 42:27.200]  all right, I need that because I had been there were no good text editors for the Mac
[42:27.200 --> 42:29.300]  and I was a computer science major.
[42:29.300 --> 42:31.200]  I needed a text editor.
[42:31.200 --> 42:36.800]  I was you know, stumbling around with I forget what I was using.
[42:36.800 --> 42:41.000]  I mean you could use teach text at the time for text files.
[42:41.000 --> 42:47.000]  There were other third-party programming text editors and the think packages,
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.700]  you know, like think Pascal had well actually think Pascal had a weird thing
[42:50.700 --> 42:52.400]  where it wasn't really a plain text editor.
[42:52.400 --> 42:56.400]  It was like before you know was before source code coloring,
[42:56.400 --> 42:58.900]  but they did like sort of like what Apple script does
[42:58.900 --> 43:01.100]  where they would as you wrote the lines of code
[43:01.100 --> 43:04.900]  and think Pascal it would like bold the keywords and stuff like that.
[43:04.900 --> 43:10.300]  Isn't that why BB edit exists wasn't because Rich Segal used did think Pascal
[43:10.300 --> 43:14.400]  and he wanted to write a text editor for it a decent text editor for it.
[43:14.400 --> 43:15.100]  What I need to do.
[43:15.100 --> 43:18.700]  What I really need to do is get rich on the show is what I should do and let him tell the story.
[43:18.700 --> 43:27.900]  But the the basic story was it started life as proof of concept that a well-constructed
[43:27.900 --> 43:36.600]  well-behaved useful Mac text editor could be written in one source code file of think of Pascal,
[43:36.600 --> 43:38.600]  you know that that there just be like,
[43:38.600 --> 43:42.200]  I don't know what he named it if it was like BB edit dot I don't cheese.
[43:42.200 --> 43:45.700]  What's the I don't even remember the file extension for Pascal anymore.
[43:45.700 --> 43:48.000]  Was it dot P? I have no idea,
[43:48.000 --> 43:51.200]  you know, but that one BB edit dot P file with it,
[43:51.200 --> 43:53.900]  you know, well structure wouldn't be like a bunch of spaghetti code.
[43:53.900 --> 43:56.600]  You could have one file and hit compile
[43:56.600 --> 44:04.500]  and out would come a useful text editor hence bare-bones bare-bones text editor.
[44:04.500 --> 44:06.100]  So it was a bar bet basically.
[44:06.100 --> 44:06.900]  Yeah, I think so.
[44:06.900 --> 44:10.900]  I think effectively it was a bar bet that he could write it in one file.
[44:10.900 --> 44:15.200]  It's has since grown to more than one file.
[44:15.200 --> 44:18.200]  And as long as outlive think Pascal to be sure
[44:18.200 --> 44:23.900]  but not just as be BB edit isn't just going strong BB edit is just has just came out
[44:23.900 --> 44:30.100]  with like a what 12.5 is the new version with some terrific new features like it's not just around.
[44:30.100 --> 44:33.300]  It is still super actively developed.
[44:33.300 --> 44:35.000]  Yeah, it's it's funny the ones
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.100]  and that's no coincidence the ones that are still around are the ones that are actively developed.
[44:39.100 --> 44:41.400]  I was as we record this just yesterday Federico.
[44:41.400 --> 44:47.200]  I teach you put out his like favorite iOS apps of the year on Mac stories and one of them is pcalc,
[44:47.200 --> 44:49.400]  which is also 25 years old,
[44:49.400 --> 44:52.400]  I believe and it's the same story which is
[44:52.400 --> 44:54.100]  and Federico said it in his write-up,
[44:54.100 --> 44:54.700]  which is you know,
[44:54.700 --> 44:59.200]  this is an ancient code base that was originally a college project for James Thompson.
[44:59.200 --> 45:00.500]  But the reason it's still around is
[45:00.500 --> 45:05.100]  because he aggressively embraces new Apple technology
[45:05.100 --> 45:07.300]  and figures out ways to get it into his product.
[45:07.300 --> 45:10.900]  Like he's not just sitting there hoping people keep using his old product
[45:10.900 --> 45:16.000]  and the same is true of BB edit right like they keep evolving it over the years
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.700]  and and if you're on the beta list which I am
[45:18.700 --> 45:23.700]  and you are it's like they're always pushing the the boundaries with with that app
[45:23.700 --> 45:28.600]  12.5 has a feature that was based on a request from me
[45:28.600 --> 45:33.100]  and I swear it was maybe like five years ago.
[45:33.100 --> 45:36.700]  Like you know how you in the Mac West 10 when you go to the help menu,
[45:36.700 --> 45:41.200]  you can start typing a menu command and if there's a menu command,
[45:41.200 --> 45:43.400]  it'll kind of highlight and tell you where it is.
[45:43.400 --> 45:44.300]  Yeah, I love that feature.
[45:44.300 --> 45:45.800]  I tell that I tell people about that
[45:45.800 --> 45:47.000]  because it's not a widely known feature
[45:47.000 --> 45:50.300]  and it's like the best way to figure out if an app does something.
[45:50.300 --> 45:53.600]  It's just literally search the menus for it.
[45:53.600 --> 45:58.000]  And as a power user you can kind of use it to give keyboard shortcuts to commands
[45:58.000 --> 46:01.500]  that you either don't know the shortcut to you know,
[46:01.500 --> 46:03.500]  just by I think if what is it shift command?
[46:03.500 --> 46:05.800]  Yeah, it's like I don't know the shortcut.
[46:05.800 --> 46:06.700]  It's just hardwired.
[46:06.700 --> 46:11.900]  So shift command slash opens the help menu and you can just start typing.
[46:11.900 --> 46:15.500]  So my suggestion was that BB edit should do its own version of that
[46:15.500 --> 46:18.500]  and do it better because it knows about its things.
[46:18.500 --> 46:24.600]  And so there's now a I think it's in the go menu go command shift command you
[46:24.600 --> 46:27.400]  and BB it has its own built-in you can just start typing something
[46:27.400 --> 46:32.700]  and it'll if there's any menu that matches it it'll be highlighted
[46:32.700 --> 46:35.900]  and you can of course arrow down and do it.
[46:35.900 --> 46:37.600]  But anyway, it's just proof to me
[46:37.600 --> 46:41.800]  that when you write in with a feature request or something like that
[46:41.800 --> 46:45.700]  and you get the feedback from Rich or from Patrick or whoever there.
[46:45.700 --> 46:49.400]  I should add that I worked at Barebone Software for two years.
[46:49.400 --> 46:54.500]  It seems like a worthy disclosure back in around 2000.
[46:54.500 --> 46:57.800]  But when they you know, they're never going to tell you
[46:57.800 --> 47:02.200]  they're very nice people and they take their they treat their customers extremely
[47:02.200 --> 47:08.000]  well, which is probably another reason that they've survived for 25 years.
[47:08.000 --> 47:11.400]  But if they tell you that like a features, that is an interesting idea.
[47:11.400 --> 47:13.700]  They might ask more like, well, how would you use it?
[47:13.700 --> 47:16.100]  Why you know, why would that be better than what's already there?
[47:16.100 --> 47:21.300]  Such and such they really do systematically put it away in somewhere
[47:21.300 --> 47:23.400]  where you they may not implement it right away.
[47:23.400 --> 47:24.200]  Like this is serious.
[47:24.200 --> 47:26.700]  I bet this is seriously like a five-year-old feature request.
[47:26.700 --> 47:30.500]  But when it first showed up in the betas for the 12.5 cycle,
[47:30.500 --> 47:32.300]  I was like, hey, that sounds like a great feature.
[47:32.300 --> 47:35.800]  And I was like, wait, I think I asked for that.
[47:35.800 --> 47:39.500]  Anyway, we have very similar taste and software Etc.
[47:39.500 --> 47:45.800]  And I truly struggle to try to do my work only on an iPad
[47:45.800 --> 47:52.500]  and I want to I think but I worry deeply that that maybe it's not that I can't
[47:52.500 --> 47:55.000]  but that I'm too old.
[47:55.000 --> 47:59.900]  I don't know what frustrates me and makes me feel like I'm like I always I often use this analogy.
[47:59.900 --> 48:04.500]  I feel like I'm wearing mittens when I'm using an iPad
[48:04.500 --> 48:12.900]  and I am really used to having fine use of all 10 fingers at the other hand.
[48:12.900 --> 48:14.600]  That's a strength in other ways
[48:14.600 --> 48:20.300]  because it's the way that I can I have can have so much going on at the Mac at one time can be distracting,
[48:20.300 --> 48:25.100]  you know in a way that it's that it's not on iPad and it's a little bit.
[48:25.100 --> 48:26.600]  I don't know mentally quieter.
[48:26.600 --> 48:29.200]  Yeah, I'm not big on the whole distraction free writing thing.
[48:29.200 --> 48:30.800]  But yeah, I agree. I agree.
[48:30.800 --> 48:36.200]  I mean that can go too far but it is it is like I'm looking at my Mac right now
[48:36.200 --> 48:40.000]  and I'm talking to you but like I've got a slack window.
[48:40.000 --> 48:41.700]  I've got an iMessage window.
[48:41.700 --> 48:45.300]  I've got you know, the our notes shared notes document.
[48:45.300 --> 48:47.400]  I've got audio hijack occasionally.
[48:47.400 --> 48:50.300]  I will get a push notification.
[48:50.300 --> 48:54.400]  I've got a dock full of items like there's a lot going on here
[48:54.400 --> 49:02.300]  and iOS can be distracting but like even it's multitasking is literally all you're seeing is two app windows.
[49:02.300 --> 49:08.900]  That's all you're seeing and and when I'm not using like usually Safari to look things up while I'm writing.
[49:08.900 --> 49:13.000]  I'm just I actually have this that wacky stand that that you
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  and I went back and forth on on Twitter
[49:15.000 --> 49:21.400]  and then I think we may have talked about the last time I was on that that I can rotate that into into horizontal or vertical.
[49:21.400 --> 49:24.800]  So I'll put it in vertical when I'm writing and I just got a big stack of text
[49:24.800 --> 49:28.500]  and I'm not multitasking at all and it's just a giant screen.
[49:28.500 --> 49:31.000]  There's only one thing in it, which is my text editor.
[49:31.000 --> 49:34.000]  That's all I'm doing and yeah, I could see a push notification.
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.100]  Although I set those up to not be super annoying.
[49:36.100 --> 49:39.700]  I can switch to other apps if I want to take a mental break,
[49:39.700 --> 49:44.400]  but there is something about it being completely locked in that way.
[49:44.400 --> 49:48.200]  And you know, I could use my MacBook Air in full screen mode apps.
[49:48.200 --> 49:50.800]  I could do that. I just never do because it's a Mac.
[49:50.800 --> 49:54.400]  That's not how I use the Mac, but it's always been how you have to use iOS.
[49:54.400 --> 49:58.500]  And so there's some I know it's kind of a trick and it's not really true,
[49:58.500 --> 50:02.700]  but it's just enough. It's like quitting out of an app saying.
[50:02.700 --> 50:04.900]  I'm not going to check Twitter while I'm working on this story.
[50:04.900 --> 50:07.600]  I'm going to quit Twitter. You can always relaunch Twitter,
[50:07.600 --> 50:11.700]  but the act of quitting Twitter puts it just further enough away that you're like,
[50:11.700 --> 50:14.800]  all right, I can I can leave it and I'm going to I'm going to focus
[50:14.800 --> 50:17.900]  and so some of that is what's going on. I wouldn't say that's the whole picture,
[50:17.900 --> 50:22.100]  but I do think that that's a part of it is that it's just a kind of a simpler place
[50:22.100 --> 50:26.200]  and it's not it's not getting in my way and it's more flexible.
[50:26.200 --> 50:31.400]  That's the thing that I also feel about it is like I can pop it in that that crazy Bridge keyboard case
[50:31.400 --> 50:36.000]  and it feels like a laptop but I can also pull it off and use it with an external keyboard
[50:36.000 --> 50:40.100]  or that smart keyboard folio or I can just leave it completely,
[50:40.100 --> 50:44.500]  you know unadorned and it's just a pure tablet experience depending on what I want
[50:44.500 --> 50:46.400]  and that's not something I can do with a MacBook Air.
[50:46.400 --> 50:50.200]  It's going to be the shape it is a hundred percent of the time.
[50:50.200 --> 50:55.400]  One of the things that I find it's an obsession of mine when I've
[50:55.400 --> 50:57.300]  and I know I've mentioned it on the show.
[50:57.300 --> 50:59.100]  I've I think I've tried to write about it,
[50:59.100 --> 51:08.200]  but maybe more in the early days of Daring Fireball than recently is a platform.
[51:08.200 --> 51:12.800]  A software platform to me takes on a life of its own
[51:12.800 --> 51:18.200]  and has character it has there's you become intimate with it
[51:18.200 --> 51:20.400]  and you know,
[51:20.400 --> 51:25.100]  just like the way that anybody a craftsman can get really used to a particular hammer
[51:25.100 --> 51:26.200]  or tool, you know,
[51:26.200 --> 51:30.300]  or illustrator certainly could become very attached to their pens,
[51:30.300 --> 51:31.100]  you know,
[51:31.100 --> 51:35.100]  and pencils and whatever or certain types of paper everybody,
[51:35.100 --> 51:35.400]  you know,
[51:35.400 --> 51:40.400]  and the whole system of an OS can take on a certain character
[51:40.400 --> 51:50.100]  and one of the very interesting things to me about Apple is that by the late 80s.
[51:50.100 --> 51:53.100]  The Mac was Apple and Apple was the Mac,
[51:53.100 --> 52:00.000]  you know that as the Apple to died off the Apple still had ambitions like that.
[52:00.000 --> 52:03.800]  Like the Apple of old would come out with new systems all the time,
[52:03.800 --> 52:04.400]  you know,
[52:04.400 --> 52:07.800]  I mean then the like the Apple to GS by the end,
[52:07.800 --> 52:13.500]  you know, the last Apple to certainly was a far different computer than the original Apple to
[52:13.500 --> 52:14.100]  and you know,
[52:14.100 --> 52:17.400]  they famously had the Newton project in the Scully years,
[52:17.400 --> 52:20.800]  which was a you know,
[52:20.800 --> 52:21.800]  almost a tragedy,
[52:21.800 --> 52:22.100]  you know,
[52:22.100 --> 52:28.400]  and is misread for those who weren't there and never used one as a bad rap as as to the,
[52:28.400 --> 52:29.000]  you know,
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.800]  quality of it.
[52:31.800 --> 52:32.200]  You know,
[52:32.200 --> 52:34.600]  it was interesting and it was interesting in good
[52:34.600 --> 52:38.000]  and ahead of its time.
[52:38.000 --> 52:38.600]  Yep,
[52:38.600 --> 52:41.700]  and very much not a pocket Macintosh.
[52:41.700 --> 52:43.200]  It had its own character.
[52:43.200 --> 52:44.000]  It really did.
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.200]  Now you there were aspects and you know,
[52:46.200 --> 52:49.000]  the things that you could see that were similar,
[52:49.000 --> 52:49.200]  you know,
[52:49.200 --> 52:49.700]  like yeah,
[52:49.700 --> 52:50.900]  that's kind of appley,
[52:50.900 --> 52:53.200]  you know,
[52:53.200 --> 52:55.600]  there was certainly some Apple likeness to it.
[52:55.600 --> 52:57.600]  That was different than Mac likeness,
[52:57.600 --> 52:58.100]  right?
[52:58.100 --> 53:04.200]  There is like in that those Steve Jobs exile years,
[53:04.200 --> 53:08.300]  a comparison of the Newton to the system seven era.
[53:08.300 --> 53:16.600]  Macintosh would be an interesting way of discerning what Apple as a company culturally was about,
[53:16.600 --> 53:19.000]  right?
[53:19.000 --> 53:20.200]  But let's face it for the most part.
[53:20.200 --> 53:20.400]  I mean,
[53:20.400 --> 53:24.400]  certainly financially what kept the company alive was the Mac.
[53:24.400 --> 53:25.300]  And in those years,
[53:25.300 --> 53:27.600]  the Mac had a very strong character.
[53:27.600 --> 53:33.800]  I would say it was stronger than Apple's it as a whole and was embraced by third-party developers
[53:33.800 --> 53:39.600]  and certainly by users and you know at a time it was a time
[53:39.600 --> 53:41.500]  and Apple was weak in certain ways
[53:41.500 --> 53:45.500]  and it was a time when third-party developers big ones like Adobe
[53:45.500 --> 53:48.400]  and Microsoft and macromedia,
[53:48.400 --> 53:55.500]  which was a separate company at the time arguably held as much control over the platform as Apple did.
[53:55.500 --> 53:59.500]  I mean in this played out in public with the switch to Mac OS 10 and the carbon
[53:59.500 --> 54:02.200]  and the cocoa and stuff like that and it's like,
[54:02.200 --> 54:02.400]  you know,
[54:02.400 --> 54:03.500]  we're it's easy.
[54:03.500 --> 54:07.100]  Now to get used to Apple saying oh,
[54:07.100 --> 54:07.300]  hey,
[54:07.300 --> 54:09.700]  everything's going to 64-bit.
[54:09.700 --> 54:10.100]  So,
[54:10.100 --> 54:11.100]  you know,
[54:11.100 --> 54:11.300]  you know,
[54:11.300 --> 54:15.500]  and it's not like they announce it and like two days later ship a version of Mac OS 10 would
[54:15.500 --> 54:16.900]  wear 32-bit apps don't work.
[54:16.900 --> 54:17.800]  I mean,
[54:17.800 --> 54:18.000]  you know,
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.900]  they've been very clear about this at WWDC over the years,
[54:20.900 --> 54:22.500]  but there was no discussion about it.
[54:22.500 --> 54:28.600]  It wasn't it's not like Apple held negotiations with developers and said we're thinking about moving everything to 64-bit.
[54:28.600 --> 54:32.800]  What do you guys think and what do you guys think the timeline should be?
[54:32.800 --> 54:33.100]  You know,
[54:33.100 --> 54:35.800]  Apple made that decision and went with it.
[54:35.800 --> 54:37.900]  Whereas at that time the initial hey,
[54:37.900 --> 54:41.700]  we're going to switch everything to cocoa was met with no you're not
[54:41.700 --> 54:46.900]  and they had to go back to the drawing board.
[54:46.900 --> 54:54.100]  And I just recently revisited this with going back to the story of word six,
[54:54.100 --> 54:58.300]  which in to me is and I when I reread it and really thought about it.
[54:58.300 --> 55:03.100]  I realized that I'd sort of filed this away in the wrong category in my mind over the years.
[55:03.100 --> 55:11.600]  Basically word Microsoft Word was a fine and Excel to were very fine Mac applications in the 80s that were,
[55:11.600 --> 55:12.100]  you know,
[55:12.100 --> 55:17.500]  if you think about it a platform that launched in 1984 and got to version 5 by the mid 90s.
[55:17.500 --> 55:22.400]  They were obviously major versions are very regular basis and you know,
[55:22.400 --> 55:27.600]  very popular lots of people used it and word 5.1
[55:27.600 --> 55:32.900]  was a 5.1 a that they wound up in a was the final resting place of that app,
[55:32.900 --> 55:40.600]  right? That's like I very specifically remember the last good version of Quark Express.
[55:40.600 --> 55:43.700]  It was three point three to our five.
[55:43.700 --> 55:45.200]  I got her like it's sick.
[55:45.200 --> 55:47.900]  I can't remember my son's friends names,
[55:47.900 --> 55:55.500]  but I can remember Quark Express three point three to our five word 5.1 a was very popular.
[55:55.500 --> 55:56.100]  It was good.
[55:56.100 --> 55:57.900]  It looked like a Mac app it,
[55:57.900 --> 55:58.400]  you know,
[55:58.400 --> 55:59.500]  it could certainly quibble.
[55:59.500 --> 56:01.400]  There were certainly Microsoft isms,
[56:01.400 --> 56:02.300]  you know,
[56:02.300 --> 56:02.900]  you know,
[56:02.900 --> 56:04.300]  it wasn't it was never my choice.
[56:04.300 --> 56:06.100]  I never really cared for it,
[56:06.100 --> 56:07.900]  but I certainly would I had like,
[56:07.900 --> 56:08.300]  you know,
[56:08.300 --> 56:10.800]  friends in college who used it and when I'd look at it,
[56:10.800 --> 56:13.200]  I wouldn't think that's a weird looking app or you know,
[56:13.200 --> 56:15.000]  it looked like a Mac word processor.
[56:15.000 --> 56:16.300]  Yeah,
[56:16.300 --> 56:20.100]  and word six was not to rehash the whole argument.
[56:20.100 --> 56:21.000]  I'll I'll you know,
[56:21.000 --> 56:21.600]  make a note here.
[56:21.600 --> 56:22.700]  I'll put it in the show notes,
[56:22.700 --> 56:25.400]  but I just linked to it Rick.
[56:25.400 --> 56:30.600]  I forget his name from the Mac BU wrote a sort of history of it.
[56:30.600 --> 56:35.700]  And basically the problem was word for Windows was an entirely different code base than word for Mac
[56:35.700 --> 56:42.600]  and they that's a huge it was a huge problem in terms of what you really want is document.
[56:42.600 --> 56:45.900]  The thing that really matters document compatibility.
[56:45.900 --> 56:50.900]  And if you couldn't just send a document from a word for Windows user to word for Mac
[56:50.900 --> 56:53.200]  and have it survive with everything intact.
[56:53.200 --> 56:54.200]  That's a problem.
[56:54.200 --> 56:58.500]  And their decision for the solution was to switch to a unified code base
[56:58.500 --> 57:04.700]  for both apps and basically they switched to the Windows code base exactly for reasons whatever,
[57:04.700 --> 57:09.600]  but what they shipped as a Mac app did not look like or act like a Mac app in any way.
[57:09.600 --> 57:13.200]  It looked it wasn't a Windows app running an emulation,
[57:13.200 --> 57:16.400]  but it might as well have been you know,
[57:16.400 --> 57:20.800]  it doesn't matter the technical reasons behind it are relevant.
[57:20.800 --> 57:24.400]  And what happened is the users rejected it.
[57:24.400 --> 57:27.200]  It was like this app is gross.
[57:27.200 --> 57:28.400]  This is unacceptable.
[57:28.400 --> 57:34.500]  We're not going to accept this we're going to stick with word 5.1 go screw yourselves.
[57:34.500 --> 57:40.000]  Yeah now so you've linked to that that piece by Rick for Microsoft a few times
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.200]  and I disagree with some of the things in it
[57:42.200 --> 57:46.300]  because I was there too and writing about Apple
[57:46.300 --> 57:49.500]  and working at a magazine that was all about the Mac
[57:49.500 --> 57:52.500]  and some of his characterizations are very much like oh,
[57:52.500 --> 57:57.200]  well the users wanted to be more Mac like which meant they wanted to be like the previous version,
[57:57.200 --> 58:00.000]  which is sort of implying that the users,
[58:00.000 --> 58:05.200]  you know didn't want change and their resistance to change was the problem and that was so not it.
[58:05.200 --> 58:12.200]  I mean the issue really was that in the in the and you remember this from this era in that in that period in the 90s.
[58:12.200 --> 58:16.600]  The Mac was dying and under heavy assault from Windows
[58:16.600 --> 58:22.600]  and one of the things that you would use a Mac you would say is I want to use the Mac
[58:22.600 --> 58:24.100]  if I'm going to choose to use the Mac.
[58:24.100 --> 58:28.600]  It's because I like the Mac and what what word six said was here.
[58:28.600 --> 58:32.100]  We got you word for Windows and now you can use it on the Mac
[58:32.100 --> 58:34.600]  and a Mac users like well, why would I do that?
[58:34.600 --> 58:37.800]  I would just use Windows if I wanted to word for Windows.
[58:37.800 --> 58:42.300]  I want word to be on the Mac and they just you know,
[58:42.300 --> 58:46.500]  I and I think the truth is and I heard this from people at Microsoft that the truth was
[58:46.500 --> 58:48.400]  their clients were IT departments
[58:48.400 --> 58:52.300]  and the IT departments didn't like the fact that the menu items
[58:52.300 --> 58:55.200]  and toolbars and everything were completely different on the Mac.
[58:55.200 --> 58:56.200]  No, that's interesting.
[58:56.200 --> 58:57.800]  And so they wanted them to be the same.
[58:57.800 --> 59:00.400]  So all their support documentation can be the same
[59:00.400 --> 59:04.300]  and that it could say here's how you here is how you get the company letterhead,
[59:04.300 --> 59:08.300]  you know, go to the file menu in Word, right?
[59:08.300 --> 59:11.800]  Doesn't matter whether it was Mac or PC and that was the thing that I think,
[59:11.800 --> 59:15.300]  you know, if your identity is it's not just your identity as a Mac user.
[59:15.300 --> 59:20.100]  It's like I made a choice to you to drink coconut Pepsi.
[59:20.100 --> 59:24.900]  And and then Pepsi says good news Pepsi comes in a coke can now it's like no,
[59:24.900 --> 59:29.000]  no, I don't I made a choice and now you're saying my choice is invalid.
[59:29.000 --> 59:31.400]  And that was that was at the root of that plus it was slow
[59:31.400 --> 59:36.500]  and bloated and bad like there was there were a lot of things wrong with it beyond the looks of it,
[59:36.500 --> 59:41.200]  but the looks of it and the way it behaved were enough to just turn people off of it.
[59:41.200 --> 59:44.200]  Basically you put your finger on exactly what I don't like.
[59:44.200 --> 59:47.700]  I mean that he was there and it's first person makes it worth reading
[59:47.700 --> 59:51.700]  but where I disagree and exactly what you put your finger on was that what they said.
[59:51.700 --> 59:57.300]  It wasn't Mac like and what they meant by Mac like was five word 5.1 and that's not true.
[59:57.300 --> 01:00:04.400]  It's that it's like what you're skipping is the issue is that being Mac like was a meaningful thing
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:11.000]  and it was it is it always has been it was from the beginning very difficult to put your finger on.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:20.900]  Brent Simmons years ago. Oh, man, baby back in like 2002 had a wonderful piece on how you know it
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:26.600]  as somebody who clearly got what Mac like software is how it still is often unhelpful
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:30.500]  because your Mac like is different than my Mac like even though we're wrong
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:34.100]  and then there's lots of people who just don't get it at all.
[01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.700]  There is a thing to being Mac like and there was
[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:40.300]  and it was very strong and it's literally what kept Apple alive
[01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:44.400]  because if Mac likeness hadn't been an important thing,
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.800]  it would there's no reason everybody wouldn't have switched to Windows at the time
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:52.500]  that there is more to it than okay.
[01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:55.900]  You've got a rectangular window and the windows all have closed buttons
[01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:58.800]  and zoom buttons and then there's a menu bar,
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:02.900]  you know with the sort of you know agreed-upon set of you know,
[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:10.000]  typical things like file edit font and you double click on an app,
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.900]  you know, and there's a mouse that moves around and you can select text
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:16.400]  and then there's a scroll bar over on the side that shows you you can drag this up
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.700]  and down to scroll up and down in a document and there you go.
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:21.900]  There's a gooey and you know, if you can use one you can use anyone
[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:25.000]  and that's all there is to it.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:31.300]  It is true that that's the fundamental description of the modern graphical user interface of a windowing system,
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:36.700]  but there's so much more to the Mac way of doing things
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:40.200]  and of organizing things and of feeling at home.
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:42.900]  I get such an amazing thing when you feel at home in an app.
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:47.000]  You've never used before because it's uses all these familiar conventions
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.500]  and there were those conventions went so much deeper than just draggable Windows
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:56.300]  with a closed button and a menu bar.
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:02:00.000]  You know, there was just Mac ways of doing things like I have never
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.100]  and this happens to this day.
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:08.800]  I have never I never get more irrationally angry then when I close a window on an app
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:12.200]  and it quits yes,
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:14.300]  I know and these days,
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:17.700]  you know, the Mac sometimes will do that because it's trying to save resources
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.400]  and if you close a text edit window,
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:22.700]  it will be like oh, I'm going to shut off text edit which I still hate
[01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:24.900]  but I understand what's going on there.
[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:31.000]  But that was one of the defining characteristics of Mac like versus PC like right is that a Mac app.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.400]  Exists and then Windows come and go as a part of its existence
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:39.900]  and a Windows app was literally a window with things inside it.
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:43.500]  Right? And if you close the window the app is the window
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:48.600]  so the app goes away and yet you get these ports from Windows
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:52.900]  from people who had no idea what the Mac was like where you close the window
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.800]  because you'd want to move on to a different project
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.500]  and the app would be like great to buy
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:00.100]  and this was at the time when sometimes it would take you like 30 seconds to launch an app
[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:01.800]  really complicated professional app.
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:04.800]  Yeah, and you'd be like no no no no.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:09.300]  It just it's like you don't get it like this was made by somebody who just doesn't get it
[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:13.100]  and and you're right like that that is it's not like there's a rule book or something
[01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:15.400]  but a Mac user knew that if you close that window,
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:18.000]  the app would not bail on it on you
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:24.200]  and be like goodbye and that was that was part of the Mac was we all know
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.800]  how this app is going to behave when I click this box.
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.400]  Everybody knows the right way to do this
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:34.200]  and if you deviate from that everybody's going to get a little bit angry at you.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:38.900]  You know, it's like the way I'm just trying to broadly draw an analogy.
[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:44.800]  It's like, you know, an episode of The X-Files has to feel like an episode of The X-Files
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:51.900]  even though maybe it's one of the episodes where it's about the deep multi-season conspiracy
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:55.300]  or maybe it's just a one-off that's even a little goofy,
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:58.100]  but it still has to feel like an episode of The X-Files right
[01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:02.100]  and there's there's something that you can't write it.
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:05.100]  You can write a book, you know, and there can be a book,
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:07.200]  you know, and that would be like the HIG,
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.600]  you know, the human interface guidelines
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:12.200]  and that's a reference that somebody writing software can say hmm.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:13.400]  I actually don't know how to do this.
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:15.300]  Should this be two different menu items
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:16.900]  or should be one menu item,
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:20.500]  you know where you can hold down a key and turn it into a different menu item.
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:22.100]  Let me see what the HIG says, you know,
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:22.800]  and I'm sure you know,
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:28.300]  I know to TV shows have books like that that the writers can consult with to,
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:31.500]  you know, let's get this right, you know, yep.
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.900]  But for the most part if you don't have an intuitive sense of the overall gist of it,
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:36.600]  you're never going to get it right.
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:40.700]  You just you know, it's got to be something that mostly you feel it
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:42.000]  and you know it when you see it
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.300]  and then you know every once in a while with the details you can look it up.
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:48.500]  Yeah, it's that you get a script for that TV show from somebody on the outside
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:53.400]  and the people who make the TV show read it and say have you ever seen our TV show like
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:56.000]  you don't know who the characters are or how the TV show feels
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.500]  and and and there were outlier apps on the Mac not as much now,
[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:05.000]  but certainly back in the day where it was that same feeling like I was like net objects fusion,
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.900]  which was a web building tool that I reviewed a bunch early kind of WYSIWYG website builder
[01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:13.600]  and it was a Windows port and like,
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:18.600]  you know, it uses little plus minuses instead of disclosure triangles.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.600]  If you close the window it quit all of these things
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.600]  and like Mac user knew you could pick that out immediately.
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:27.100]  Like you are the fraud here.
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:28.700]  You are not a real Mac app.
[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:31.700]  And that's just again. It wasn't that it wasn't usable
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:34.800]  and it wasn't that I my design sensibilities were offended.
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:38.600]  It was that I had made my choice
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:43.800]  and I was one of the advantages all apps had was this kind of common frame of reference
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:47.000]  and then that app did not share it and it was frustrating to use.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.100]  Yeah, the plus-minus thing versus disclosure triangles is maybe one of the great examples
[01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:55.900]  because I'm I'm I am and always have been a hundred percent
[01:05:55.900 --> 01:06:02.100]  a hundred percent convinced that the disclosure triangle visual metaphor is better.
[01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:05.500]  It's it is both more attractive and more intuitive.
[01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:09.700]  It looks closed when it's closed. It looks open when it's open.
[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:17.000]  It goes down it the the switching from pointing to the side for closed to pointing down to be open
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.800]  creates the opportunity for an animation affordance that makes perfect sense.
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.700]  You could see the triangle flipping in a rotating thing
[01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:29.000]  and maybe the you know in later years is animation got more prevalent in the OS.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.900]  You could see the contents of the folder or whatever go down the plus-minus thing.
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:37.200]  I plus and minus make no sense in that context to me
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:41.200]  and they used to draw the little dotting line.
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:44.400]  It just led to this crazy visual thing
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:48.200]  where they'd have all these lines all over the place that weren't necessary, right?
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:53.000]  All you need are the triangles and indentation, right?
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:59.200]  And you know you it would transfer to things like outliners,
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.200]  right like so you'd have you know,
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:04.200]  like one of Dave Weiner's outliners from the early 90s
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:09.600]  or late 80s would of course use disclosure triangles to hide
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:14.000]  and show hierarchy of the outline which is something maybe it's like an essay
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.100]  or research paper you're researching
[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:22.400]  and the way that you would close disclose the hierarchy of that worked exactly the same
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:25.500]  as in the finder when you were dealing with files.
[01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:31.800]  No, right. I'm the outliner works like that to this day, right?
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:34.600]  One of the words I like for it is idiomatic
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:38.200]  and idiomatic usually was referred to like grammar,
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:41.600]  you know, and that one of the ways that you can kind of tell sometimes
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:47.800]  when somebody speaks your native language as a second language isn't that they're wrong per se
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:52.800]  is that they say things that nobody who's spoken natively whatever put together.
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:56.400]  They're unfamiliar with certain idioms.
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:07.300]  And you I sometimes I wonder how how I ever got semi-decent grades in English going through school
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:10.200]  in the grammar classes because I never knew the rules.
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:14.000]  I mean I could you know, I could I parts of speech I could get
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.600]  and then once we got past that it was like forget it.
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.800]  I have no idea what the hell you're talking about.
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.300]  I just do it by ear.
[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:26.800]  I've always just written and read by ear and you know,
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:30.100]  making good Mac software has always been like that.
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:33.200]  They're just idioms that you use and when you violate them,
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:37.100]  it just seems bizarre right like spelling an okay button.
[01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:41.400]  Okay a why like it's not wrong.
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:44.100]  You can look in the dictionary and you know,
[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:48.500]  there are certain publications that even in putting in their style guide that the word.
[01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:52.900]  Okay is spelled out. Okay a why it's a it is in the dictionary.
[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:57.500]  There are publications that prefer it.
[01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:01.500]  It doesn't go in a dialogue not a Mac.
[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:06.100]  I was going to say that the elements of style or a or a grammar textbook.
[01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:07.600]  It's kind of like the Hig for grammar.
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.900]  So you internalize it because you learn the language
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:13.300]  and you do it by absorbing it and seeing that people use it this way.
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:15.200]  And then the reason the you know,
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:17.800]  learning the parts of speech and all that kind of exists is
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.700]  as the reference material.
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:22.000]  So if you don't know what to do you can be like,
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.600]  well, okay, what's the what are the rules here?
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:30.500]  But I think mostly it's innate right that you absorb it by watching it in use
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:33.600]  and then you understand it and and for computing platforms to broaden it out.
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:37.800]  Like that is how computing platforms work is that if you're a user of a platform
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:42.100]  and you may not even know it you may not think of yourself as a big like computer user
[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:43.900]  or smartphone user, but you know,
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:47.600]  you spend time on the iPhone or an Android phone or whatever you absorb sort of
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.100]  like what the rules are and how things work
[01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:52.400]  and then you get frustrated if things don't work,
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.600]  right and right is defined as I mean,
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:59.300]  there's a reason why every app doesn't have a completely different control scheme,
[01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:03.500]  right because if literally that's how it was in the early days of computing
[01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:06.800]  where every single app ran differently
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.600]  and you had to figure out what its commands were
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.100]  because every single one was different.
[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:13.400]  It's terrible, right? You want to have that common frame of reference
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:16.900]  and we all absorb that which is why I mean to this day.
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:23.400]  That was why I got I ended up in a very loud room at XOXO a couple years ago
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:26.400]  with a designer from Google who was mad at me
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:34.500]  because I wrote a story complaining about the Google iOS apps using the Google share icon
[01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:38.200]  instead of the iOS share icon and you know,
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:43.800]  it's the most like who cares but but I didn't like it because as an iOS user I
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:46.700]  I looked at the icon might be like what the hell is this?
[01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:49.100]  I don't know what this exploding blob means.
[01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:52.800]  What I'm looking for a little box with an arrow coming out of it.
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:56.000]  And you know, that was that was just I didn't know that language
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.800]  because it was not my language.
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:02.000]  I just ran into that at dinner two nights ago Amy and I and Jonas were out
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.900]  and Amy wanted to send a link to a product to her sister
[01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:11.400]  and a text message and she searched for it.
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:14.100]  It came up with an Amazon link
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:18.200]  and she clicked it and because it was on her phone and she has the Amazon app.
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.300]  It opened up in the Amazon app,
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:26.500]  not the website right and it was the right product,
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.300]  but there is nowhere on that page.
[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:35.100]  Amazon's iOS apps are very bad especially in this idiomatic design language,
[01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:41.200]  right? It is very they're very clearly little web things that I'm I don't have my pixel in front of me.
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:43.900]  I'm quite certain that if I open the Amazon app on my pixel,
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:49.800]  it'll look exactly the same but there is no there was no little box with an arrow coming out of it.
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:52.600]  Like how to copy a link like here it is.
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:55.000]  Here's the Amazon app showing me the product
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  and all I want to do is I want the box with an arrow who knows what's in the share sheet.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.900]  I don't know maybe hopefully it'll be a you know,
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:06.600]  maybe I could just go right to messages but you know,
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:13.700]  they're at very least there should be copy right right and literally I couldn't I couldn't figure it out.
[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:16.800]  It's because it didn't stick to the idiom.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:20.000]  There's only one and it there must be some way to do it.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.500]  I guess but it that's something at iOS that is so into you know,
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:27.700]  here's the thing and you want to do something with it.
[01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:30.400]  You look for the box with the arrow.
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:31.400]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:36.700]  And we could debate whether the Google icon is is better or more understandable.
[01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:38.900]  You could do user testing all that's fine.
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.600]  But the point is that if you're on iOS,
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:44.900]  there's a thing you look for and if you're on Android likewise,
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:46.900]  because when I wrote this I heard from people it's like,
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:51.400]  oh, well, you know Apple does this wrong on Apple music for Android is that is that any better?
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.300]  And my answer is no,
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:56.500]  it's not better you should be a good citizen on the platform you live on
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:59.900]  and it's not just because I think one platform is better than the other it's
[01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:02.700]  because a platform speaks a language
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:05.000]  and people learn it whether they know they're learning it or not.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.600]  And then you want it to be consistent and that's what good platform design I know,
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:13.400]  you know, and all the app developers who listen to this are nodding probably
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:16.300]  because it's a thing that they have to learn to which is even
[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:18.800]  if you have a great idea for a better way to do it.
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:21.600]  If it's completely contrary to the way everybody else does it.
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:27.000]  It's going to be a tough sell because nobody is going to expect this behavior.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.100]  Even if it is better nobody expects it.
[01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:35.000]  So you better you better be a lot better and even then you're taking a huge risk
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.100]  and you know, it's not something like pull to refresh which was a kind of painting
[01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:42.300]  in an area that was previously unpainted.
[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.700]  It's like if you're trying to go everybody does it this way
[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:45.800]  and you're going to do it this different way
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:48.600]  because you think it's better even if it might be slightly better.
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:52.100]  It's the wrong decision because nobody knows how to do that.
[01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:55.200]  Everybody knows the other way pulled over.
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:59.700]  I'm going to file a pull to refresh away because that is a really good point.
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:04.300]  I've got about six threads here in my head and I can't keep six threads going.
[01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:07.000]  We were talking about iOS at some point.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.100]  But I want to one thing I want to finish up
[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:13.100]  before we go on is I want to finish up on my point of why I think I've misfiled
[01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:18.700]  the saga of word six for Mac in my head is that when it happened at the time again,
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:20.800]  I wasn't a word user personally.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:27.100]  So it didn't you know, there was a certain smugness to the this isn't my problem.
[01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:29.900]  Poor suckers who use Microsoft Word have to deal with this
[01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:32.500]  and I was I had to use it in my college newspaper used it
[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:36.500]  in the mind obviously all the manuscripts of the magazine were written in Word.
[01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:40.600]  My college newspaper was a Claris house.
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.100]  So we wanted everything in Mac,
[01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:46.800]  right format or and or Claris works worked equally.
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:47.600]  Wow all Mac,
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:52.400]  right and class and you know,
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:57.100]  eventually there was one columnist who was submitting files and bbedit text files,
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:03.200]  but it didn't matter because he was also doing the layout of the shirt paper.
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:04.300]  But for years though,
[01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:07.600]  I filed it away as a tragedy of this was terrible,
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.700]  you know, there was an app that was a fine Mac app
[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:11.400]  and I was already at that point,
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:15.200]  you know cared about good Mac apps,
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:17.100]  right and I thought this is a tragedy
[01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:20.000]  because here was a fine Mac app from Microsoft
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.200]  and now Microsoft obviously sees this,
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:29.600]  you know, you know saw this is fine to ship for the Mac.
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:30.800]  And mostly out of danger,
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.800]  you know, because at the time by that time Microsoft's growing power
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:35.800]  in the industry was obvious and it you know,
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:39.700]  was worrisome because man and just if this starts a trend this is bad news,
[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:42.500]  right? Like I don't want to see this happening to apps.
[01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:44.000]  I do use like Photoshop,
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.900]  right? Like I don't want some new version of Photoshop to come out
[01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:50.700]  and be the word six of photoshops.
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:54.700]  So for decades, I've had this filed under as a bad incident.
[01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:59.100]  Whereas what I realize now is it was one of the finest moments in the Mac history
[01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:00.400]  because it didn't work
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:04.200]  and it made the reaction was so strong from users that just
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:07.000]  and what is a more typical.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.400]  It's not the word Microsoft Word is not an esoteric app,
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:15.700]  right? It was literally one of the most popular apps on the platform.
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:18.900]  I would guess by headcount me maybe Mac right had more
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:21.400]  because I guess they used to ship Mac right for free
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:25.600]  but by the point when five word five was out I would I would probably argue
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:30.400]  that it was the most commonly used in a in a professional sense.
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:33.600]  It almost certainly was maybe in schools Mac,
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:34.500]  right was still more popular.
[01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:38.400]  But regardless it was a mainstream app and it was rejected
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:41.400]  and it would the rejection was so strong
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:47.000]  and the Mac was still deemed by Microsoft to be important enough to care
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.000]  that Microsoft formed an entire business unit the Mac be you
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.600]  I mean creatively named but they said,
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:58.900]  okay, we to do this,
[01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:00.900]  right? We need you know,
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:06.100]  we need a real team big team of Mac people who get the Mac
[01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:11.400]  and right let's do it right and then word 98,
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:14.200]  you know again was never really to my liking
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:17.800]  but was a credible Mac app and and word ended up,
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.800]  you know to this day is still I mean,
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:20.100]  I don't know.
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:23.900]  I don't know what it looks like now probably looks like crap just
[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:26.200]  because it's it's leaked over time,
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:28.600]  but it's it's okay.
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:30.800]  What I would say is ironically enough.
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:33.200]  It looks like word for Windows,
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:36.000]  which looks like word for iPad.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.900]  Yeah. Yeah, exactly kind of kind of interesting.
[01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:42.000]  I like where I like office on iPad better than I like it on the Mac at this point.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:49.200]  And I think some of that may just be that the Mac version feels very very Windows like to me
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:51.500]  and the iOS version feels very iOS like to me,
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:55.400]  but it is I very rarely I use Excel some I have an office
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:59.400]  365 subscription word is not an app that I particularly use.
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:03.700]  Although there are people like Dan Morin writes his novels and Scrivener,
[01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:07.100]  but you know, the publishing industry is entirely still based on words.
[01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:12.900]  So in the last step he does is compile his book out of Scrivener into a word file
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:15.000]  and then all of his editorial revisions
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.400]  and everything that happens in the publishing process.
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:19.000]  He's got to do in Word.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.100]  Oh my God, I would yeah,
[01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:25.800]  this is why I can't write a book now,
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:28.400]  but it's a but to me that that rejection of it
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:30.300]  and that it was still seems so important.
[01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:30.900]  It's a triumph.
[01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:34.500]  It was a triumph of the Mac at maybe and again,
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.200]  not maybe not at the peak of Apple's power,
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:40.700]  but at the peak of the max platform Integrity
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:41.700]  and they did the right thing.
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:44.600]  I mean that that is the the story that doesn't get told enough about
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:49.100]  what six is that Microsoft completely Reformed itself
[01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:51.000]  when it got that feedback.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.500]  There were people inside Microsoft who obviously said look
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:54.700]  if we're going to be on the Mac.
[01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:56.500]  We need to actually be on the Mac
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:19:00.200]  and not have this be a symptom of us not caring about this platform.
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:02.000]  And then you know that was with the you know,
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.300]  Bill Gates appears on the screen
[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:04.500]  and they're going to do an investment
[01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:06.300]  and they want Apple to continue and all of that.
[01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:08.600]  That was all part of the same thing
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:13.000]  and and they did I mean the Mac BU ended up being I don't know
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.900]  if it still is but it was for a very long time the largest concentration
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:22.400]  of Mac developers outside of Apple were Microsoft
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.500]  and they were building all those products on the Mac
[01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:29.700]  and they were never quite Mac like in the same way again,
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:33.100]  but like that first even that first release they were at least
[01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:34.700]  trying whenever we're at least trying.
[01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:38.600]  Yeah, like seriously like like they got the drag-and-drop stuff
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:40.700]  to work right which seems so basic
[01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:43.600]  but like they were they went into kind of like Olay land
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.600]  which was like drag-and-drop for Windows
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:47.000]  and they had like extensions
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.600]  and stuff and they're like they backed out of a lot of that stuff
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:52.200]  and then the OS 10 transition they committed to it.
[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:54.100]  They were there they did a good job.
[01:19:54.100 --> 01:19:58.000]  Like they got back on the on the horse afterwards six
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.400]  and it's to their credit,
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:02.700]  but it's also because all the people who use that product
[01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:05.500]  push back. Yeah. All right,
[01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:06.500]  let me take a break here
[01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:10.800]  and thank our next sponsor helpfully comes with the pronunciation
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.000]  is this hello pillow pronounced.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.800]  Hello, but here's one it's spelled hul o they're out.
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.800]  Let's just forget that they're a longtime sponsor of the show
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.000]  and I'm familiar with them.
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000]  I don't know how else I would pronounce that
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.200]  but here's one which I don't know if they're worried
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:28.300]  if people are calling them a hula or something,
[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:31.300]  but there's two L's so it's obviously hello,
[01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:33.400]  but maybe my reputation precedes me
[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:36.000]  and and I do have a pronunciation guide.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.300]  Well, anyway, have you ever tried a buckwheat pillow?
[01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:41.600]  They are totally different from the fluffy soft pillows.
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:44.400]  Most of us are used to not just a different feeling.
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:45.700]  They're actually quite heavy.
[01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:49.800]  Honestly, it's most similar to a beanbag years ago
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:52.600]  when I first heard about them sounded like a really weird idea
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:56.800]  for a pillow but turns out this isn't just something they invented.
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:59.300]  Buckwheat pillows have been used around the world,
[01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:03.400]  especially in Asian countries for hundreds of years.
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:06.600]  This is actually a normal pillow in a lot of parts of the world
[01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:09.000]  or a normal way to make a pillow.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.800]  Now it supports your head and neck the way you want it to
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.700]  unlike a traditional squishy soft pillow.
[01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:18.000]  They allow your neck to fall flat into a downward bend
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.600]  and which can be uncomfortable.
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:23.800]  And so hello is not just support the position you want.
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:27.700]  They also stay cool and dry compared to pillows filled with feathers
[01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:34.100]  or foam most pillows absorb and retained body heat with a buckwheat pillow
[01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:38.300]  tends to breathe better air can get through the buckwheat husks inside
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:40.800]  and so you don't have to flip like their thing is that you don't have to flip
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.900]  to the cool side of the pillow like in the middle of the night
[01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:44.900]  where you flip your pillow around because your pillows too hot.
[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:46.700]  You don't have to do that with the hollow pillow.
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:52.500]  We have had them for years my wife and son in particular swear by them.
[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:57.000]  Absolutely positively love them and genuinely complain about them
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.400]  not having them when we travel they are great products
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:05.300]  and I'll tell you what I think it's at least I think it's at least three years
[01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:08.100]  maybe longer got to be at least three years.
[01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:12.400]  They last my wife's hollow pillow, which he sleeps on every single night.
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:15.600]  It's the original one that they sent years ago when they first sponsored the show.
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:20.600]  So they really do last a long time and they're easily adjustable.
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:25.900]  All you do is unzip it and add more or take more out
[01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:28.200]  and that's how you adjust the thickness
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:32.700]  and it's because you can adjust the thickness and it stays you don't need a second pillow
[01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:34.400]  like one even if I like to you know,
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:38.100]  if you like to be propped up a little bit you like to be a little bit more off the bed.
[01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:42.200]  You don't need that with a hollow pillow one one hollow pillow can be you can adjust it to be flatter.
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:45.100]  You can puff it up a little prop it up against the back of the bed
[01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:48.400]  and be a little higher up really really easy to adjust
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:52.200]  and it'll stay the way you have it set up all night long.
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:57.000]  Hello. The pillows are made in the USA with quality construction
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.400]  and materials the cotton case certified organic cut

[01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:54.900]  slash the talk show find out more.
[01:23:54.900 --> 01:24:00.200]  So here's a great example from that era that I wanted to touch on Mac paint was one of the original Mac apps
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:05.200]  from Apple famously made by Bill Atkinson who invented quickdraw
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:07.200]  and a bunch of you know,
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:12.200]  one of the great great more than just an engineer engineer
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:15.500]  and designer everything from that era
[01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:20.300]  and a lot of the concepts of Mac paint would be very familiar to people today
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:24.800]  using apps like acorn or pixelmator
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.200]  or any of the drawing apps,
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:30.000]  you know a palette of tools and a pencil for drawing
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.500]  and an eraser and you click on it in the palette
[01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:35.900]  and then you can erase and draw blah blah blah.
[01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:38.300]  I remember when I first saw Photoshop
[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:42.000]  and I don't know what version was maybe 2.5
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:50.500]  maybe 2.0. I don't know somewhere in that era and Photoshop could obviously do a lot more than Mac paint
[01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:56.100]  and it I there was nothing I may not know where everything was like I did.
[01:24:56.100 --> 01:24:59.700]  Maybe I didn't know the first time how to do Gaussian blur or something like that.
[01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:03.900]  But when I just you know wanted to do something my first guess
[01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:09.200]  as to how to do it was exactly obvious to me like it's probably in this menu.
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:14.100]  Oh, yeah there and you know, it was a super powerful app.
[01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:15.800]  It was like it's amazing what this app can do.
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:18.800]  It's amazing how big the files are that it can open.
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:21.000]  It's amazing how stable it is.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.500]  But and you know, the interface was very different in Photoshop back then than it is now.
[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:29.600]  It certainly was a lot more dialogue based where you'd invoke a command
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:31.600]  and a modal dialogue would come up
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:34.200]  and you would enter you know,
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:39.000]  a lot of stuff that you would do visually today with the mouse rubbing over a thing.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  You would do by entering numeric values and cells
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:47.500]  and hitting buttons in a modal dialogue box and then seeing if you like the result
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:50.100]  and then if not undoing to try something else.
[01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:52.100]  Yep, just because that was it was the Nate,
[01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:55.100]  you know, that's how we got from there to here,
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:26:00.400]  you know, I mean there just wasn't the computing power to do everything live back then really.
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:01.400]  I mean, that's the main thing.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:05.400]  It's not like I think it was obvious that it would be better to directly manipulate the images
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:10.300]  but a lot of the stuff you would do in Photoshop would you hit the close,
[01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:13.900]  you know, the OK button to apply it or whatever the action button name
[01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:16.700]  and then you sit there and wait,
[01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:21.000]  you know, and it would give correctly as it should would give you visual feedback.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000]  Maybe a progress dialogue if it was long enough,
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.200]  but whatever was needed to show you like,
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:30.400]  okay, you know, I'm working on it.
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:33.300]  It would be working on it and then you'd see the result.
[01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:36.400]  But those dialogue boxes had so much power
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:43.100]  and had so many great features and they were organized in a way that felt so Mac like it.
[01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:44.600]  There's no other way to describe it.
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:49.800]  It wasn't like they invented some new language for image editors.
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:55.100]  It was like they took what a Mac like image editor should be a very simple app like Mac paint
[01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:58.100]  and expounded upon it.
[01:26:58.100 --> 01:27:01.700]  Sure, but that was an app built by native speakers,
[01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:04.300]  right? They were they were they knew the Mac in
[01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:10.100]  and out the brothers did the Knoll Brothers and so they John and Thomas and all I can't remember.
[01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:14.800]  John is the one who's still at John's at I John's at ILM,
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:18.000]  right? I want to say and I think Thomas is still Thomas Adobe.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.500]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:21.300]  That's right. Yeah.
[01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:26.400]  And John even got like story credit on the Star Wars Rogue One.
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:31.000]  Exactly right. How's that for a freaking life co-invented Photoshop
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.800]  and made a Star Wars movie?
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:34.400]  Yeah, pretty pretty good.
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:39.700]  Pretty good. I I was visiting ILM with our friend Todd Taziri
[01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:44.700]  and and guy walked by in the cafeteria and Todd says,
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:47.200]  oh, hey, John and walks by and then he turns to me.
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:48.800]  He says that was John Knoll and I'm like,
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:53.900]  but and he said and I think Todd at the time said you're one of the people
[01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:55.300]  who would care more about that.
[01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:58.400]  He's the guy who made Photoshop and the guy who was like,
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:00.400]  you're right accurate. That is completely accurate.
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.900]  I'm more impressed that that's the guy who co-invented Photoshop
[01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:07.700]  than his incredibly impressive history working at ILM on Star Wars movies
[01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:10.700]  and other sci-fi movies that are touchstones of my life
[01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:13.800]  because he wrote Photoshop right like it's huge,
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:15.300]  but they knew it that the Knoll Brothers knew it.
[01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:18.500]  They knew the Mac well and so Photoshop I had that same experience
[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:21.400]  using Photoshop on the Mac in college that that you know,
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:23.700]  yeah, you got it and this is the you know,
[01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:27.100]  I feel like this is a roundabout way of what you're getting to is this question
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:33.500]  of like Mac like versus iPad like and hanging over tell me how you feel about this.
[01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:36.000]  But because we're right here at the end of 2018.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:42.600]  I feel like 2019 is going to be the year with the most tumultuous change
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:50.500]  in terms of the identity of the Mac since OS 10 came out.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.500]  I don't know. I think that's possible and yeah,
[01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:59.500]  I mean, it's it's yeah, you tell me in one way the marzipan thing.
[01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:03.900]  I think I think because you wrote about this on on during Fireball a bit about
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:05.800]  like what is Mac like and what is not Mac like
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:09.200]  and how the marzipan apps aren't Mac like and you know,
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:13.900]  I reacted to those pieces by saying to myself.
[01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:18.700]  I think the problem here is that Apple is going to redefine
[01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:27.700]  what Mac like is to be what sort of like app like is I just get this real feeling
[01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:33.900]  that in 2019 what Apple is going to do is say we now have a unified app platform
[01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:36.900]  and iOS apps can run on the Mac
[01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:39.500]  and maybe they're going to make other changes
[01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:42.500]  and sort of say this is how we want apps to behave now
[01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:46.900]  and it's going to be something that is informed by iOS
[01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:54.300]  and the and the behavior of iOS in a way that is going to be more foreign to Mac users
[01:29:54.300 --> 01:29:56.900]  and especially if you're a Mac user who doesn't use iOS
[01:29:56.900 --> 01:30:00.500]  and I guess those people exist it will be I think maybe especially foreign
[01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:04.800]  but the idea that Apple is going to sort of say this is how we want apps to behave now
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:09.400]  and it is a little bit like saying how an app behaves slightly different on an iPhone
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:14.200]  than on an iPad. They'll be sort of like on an iPhone and an iPad and a Mac,
[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:21.000]  but I just I feel like the marzipan thing you can't bring iOS apps to the Mac
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:29.000]  and have them just be weird and different like the platform has to have some sort of unification,
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:34.700]  but I think it's most likely that what Apple is going to do is say these marzipan apps
[01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:40.300]  are part of a new way of thinking of apps on the Mac
[01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:45.400]  and that they're going to kind of redefine what Mac how Mac apps behave as a part of this
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:51.100]  because I do think ultimately they want a single unified app platform across all their devices.
[01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:54.600]  It probably gives them the ability to add touch to the Mac
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:59.600]  for the first time because they'll be bringing touch first apps to the platform
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:04.000]  that actually could potentially work with touch not necessarily in 2019,
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.900]  but eventually I just I feel like this is their this is their ultimate solution
[01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:13.100]  the marzipan stuff to what do we do with a Mac in a world where iOS is our most important platform
[01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:16.100]  and the answer is we're not going to replace the Mac,
[01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:19.000]  but we might replace the Mac app platform
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:23.300]  so that the common way we think of a Mac app is something that's built on UI kit
[01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:27.000]  and also runs on iOS. I think that's possible
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:31.800]  and it's absolutely you've absolutely nailed a area of conversation.
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:38.800]  I wanted to have with you. I think that what you just said is entirely possible.
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:42.600]  I think you say that with no enthusiasm. I do have no enthusiasm.
[01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:48.800]  I have no enthusiasm because what we've seen so far is is not good.
[01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:55.800]  I should also clarify that just just you know,
[01:31:55.800 --> 01:32:00.000]  people listen to the show probably know it but Apple hasn't given a name to marzipan
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.500]  like that marzipan is something that leaked as a code name
[01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:08.400]  and I know it is used internally to refer to some you know,
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:17.500]  this this project to get these four apps news stocks home and voice recorder.
[01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:25.700]  Yeah running on the Mac and for all the reasons you said
[01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:36.900]  and for general consensus that the iOS developers of which there are many more
[01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:42.700]  than there are Mac developers have largely rejected creating Mac apps
[01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:45.100]  because they see it as too much work
[01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:52.600]  and or two different and or slightly difficult in certain ways which we don't need to get into
[01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:59.100]  and neither of us are really I get it at the broad strokes that app kit is old
[01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:05.000]  and UI kit is newer and a lot of the things in UI kit that are different than app kit are things
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.700]  that they took the you know,
[01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:11.100]  the people who used it the most and created it,
[01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:16.200]  you know for stalls iOS software team that started it next could say starting in you know,
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:21.400]  2005 or 2006 whenever they started that that work for the app framework
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:23.000]  for the iPhone could say well,
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000]  wait, we know app kit intimately.
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.300]  What are some of the things we hate about it
[01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:29.500]  and would do differently if we could do it all over again
[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:31.100]  because we're doing it all over again
[01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:34.400]  and we can even make changes that would break app.
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:36.400]  We can't just say these are good ideas.
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:39.700]  We should do them in app kit too because app kit has to keep being app kit,
[01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:41.600]  right? It's just one of those things.
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:43.800]  Here's an opportunity for a clean break.
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:50.300]  Let's do it that way and then Mac developers could look at UI kit and say hey,
[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:55.200]  that's cool. This is so much easier in UI kit than app kit and then
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:59.800]  but now we're at the point where there's probably millions of iOS developers
[01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:02.900]  who started with UI kit who look at app kit,
[01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:06.200]  which has the old way and say well,
[01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:09.600]  that seems like a lot of work. Why would I do that?
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:13.200]  You know and who maybe don't get it period they don't get the whole Mac like thing.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:15.700]  Anyway, right so I get it.
[01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:17.300]  I get that there's a market for that.
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:19.300]  I don't know though that what we've seen.
[01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:25.300]  I don't know that this project actually is that initiative
[01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:30.800]  like there may even be an initiative along the lines of exactly what you're saying.
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:37.300]  A more unified UI kit derived way of making apps for all platforms,
[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:41.800]  including the Mac which would be here's our new way of doing it.
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:47.100]  That is not the thing that was used to make these four apps.
[01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:50.700]  I mean, maybe it's sort of is and this is just one little piece of it,
[01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:58.000]  but that the whole picture is so much bigger that it's not even worth thinking about
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.500]  or thinking about based on what we've seen so far in these four apps in Mojave.
[01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:05.400]  Like I really think that it might be that shallow an effort.
[01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:10.500]  I've I can't I agree and it better be right because these apps are kind of crappy,
[01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:12.800]  but it so I but I think you're right.
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:16.600]  I think there's Mark Gurman said something at some point about how there's
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:20.700]  more as a pan but there's also like a whole bunch of other efforts
[01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:25.600]  that they're doing in terms of ways that developers can build uis and things like that.
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:30.200]  I think maybe there is a much bigger picture that we haven't seen that is not just,
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:34.900]  you know, the same tools that brought you the home app will now be available to everyone,
[01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:37.400]  right? It's good. It's going to be a completely,
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:46.100]  you know, much bigger thing. I think then what we've seen so far the thing that bothers me about these apps is that they saw them as being worth shipping
[01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:53.300]  because it's it's the sort of thing that the user shouldn't have to worry about right like so for example,
[01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:56.900]  let's just compare and contrast with and maybe it's a bad analogy.
[01:35:56.900 --> 01:36:00.100]  I don't know because programming languages are different than the application Frameworks,
[01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:11.300]  but you know Apple software development across all platforms is moving from objective C,
[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:17.500]  which has been around since the late 80s to a new programming language called Swift.
[01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:22.400]  And every year more and more of the OSS are written inside Apple
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:29.100]  and Swift then objective C and third-party apps are new ones are often created entirely
[01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:36.400]  in Swift from beginning and old ones as new features are added or being written in Swift instead of objective C.
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:40.700]  And guess what from a user's perspective they could have never heard of either of those things
[01:36:40.700 --> 01:36:46.900]  or have any idea what the difference between objective C and Swift is and there's not there's no visible sign of it whatsoever,
[01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:51.900]  which is how it should be right. That's it's that's developer problem.
[01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:58.100]  So like like this it's a totally a developer problem.
[01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:03.400]  If it's you know, really it is a problem is a problem enough problematic enough
[01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:09.800]  that Apple needs to make a serious effort to fix it to get iOS apps more easily ported to the Mac
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:16.100]  or sharing more code with the Mac or make the Mac app with the way you make a Mac app more like it.
[01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:22.900]  Okay, fine, but then whatever the result of that problem is it shouldn't be painfully obvious to a typical Mac user
[01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:26.500]  who opens the app that this app is weird.
[01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:33.200]  Right, right this goes back to all our conversations that we just had about weird Windows apps that get ported to the Mac.
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:37.300]  It's like if it doesn't feel right like what's wrong with this thing.
[01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:40.600]  Why does it play or the all those Java apps that we got in the 90s
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:45.900]  and early 2000s that were just totally not right like something is really wrong.
[01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:49.800]  You'd open them up and there would be they would have a Mac menu bar,
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:53.900]  but the Mac menu bar would just be like two items like one of which was to quit the app
[01:37:53.900 --> 01:38:00.100]  and then all of the other menu items were in a Windows style menu bar within the window of the app.
[01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:05.900]  So not only was it wrong to have a Windows style menu bar in the window.
[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:10.800]  It also had a Mac menu bar that didn't have the menu items.
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:14.600]  I mean, it was terrible Mars if these marzipan apps are not that bad.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:17.600]  I'm calling a marzipan because we need we need a name to talk about it.
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:22.200]  So yeah, because Apple Apple very aggressively did not name it at WWDC.
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:27.800]  It's just a new method of building apps that is coming in 2019, right?
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:31.900]  But these apps have that that this doesn't belong on the platform.
[01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:39.500]  This does weird things stuff, you know that and it's a just feels weird for the Mac in general,
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:43.700]  but it feels really weird to be shipping as part of the system from Apple.
[01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:49.300]  I don't have I'm not still not running Mojave as my main OS so I can't look at them right here.
[01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:51.000]  But I mean just off the top of my head.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.900]  There's a lot of weird drag-and-drop problems in these apps,
[01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:57.300]  which is the sort of thing you sometimes expect from third-party apps,
[01:38:57.300 --> 01:39:04.400]  but never from Apple apps. It's like and I think it's the news app maybe news
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:07.500]  and stocks because news and stocks are sort of the same app.
[01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:11.500]  It's sort of like stocks is really just a way to get Apple news about the companies
[01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:16.300]  that are listed in the stocks, right? It's like if you make the window wide,
[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:19.100]  it's just it you can make the window as wide as you want,
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:23.800]  but the content doesn't reflow to fit it which in and of itself.
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:26.100]  It's not like you have to be a good Mac app.
[01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:30.100]  You would have to support a the full width of a 30 inch iMac.
[01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:35.700]  But if there is a maximum width that you can flow to that should be the maximum width of the window.
[01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:39.100]  Like like it's it's always been like I'm sure you'll agree.
[01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:42.500]  One of the top signs of a you're new to writing Mac apps.
[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:46.900]  Aren't you is if an app would let you make the window too small,
[01:39:46.900 --> 01:39:50.700]  right? Like there's you know, a good Mac app has always known.
[01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:52.200]  All right, you can resize the window.
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:56.600]  But here's the max that we can handle gracefully and here's the minimum.
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:59.100]  We can handle gracefully and that's it.
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:02.400]  And when you could get an app that would make you should let you shrink it up as far as you want
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:05.800]  and you'd start covering up buttons and controls and stuff.
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:07.400]  It's like oh my God, you could just fix this
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:12.500]  and res at it. Marzipan apps have a lot of stuff like that.
[01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:16.400]  But the way that like sidebars work the way that there's no contextual menu items
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:21.700]  like standard ones that every single app has had since Mac OS 10 shipped.
[01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:26.500]  It's just weird. The sharing thing is one of the ones I've written about
[01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:33.600]  and they did fix it and I don't know if me writing about it had any effect on that.
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:37.100]  I don't want to take credit for it, but even the way they they fixed it.
[01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:43.400]  It's so weird. So that the one of the problems with Apple News on Mojave is if you read it,
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:49.600]  say there's an article from six colors in and you read it in Apple News and you're like,
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:51.800]  this is a good story. I would like to share this.
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:57.500]  I would like to, you know, put it in an iMessage or mail it to a friend.
[01:40:57.500 --> 01:41:02.500]  On iOS, you can hit the our good old friend from half an hour ago,
[01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:07.000]  the square box with the arrow and one of the options would be like message
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:14.900]  and you could send a message on the and you could copy the URL and get a real URL or no.
[01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:18.300]  I know what it is. iOS has a open in Safari button.
[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:21.700]  And so you can make the article open from Apple News in Safari
[01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:25.000]  and it'll take you to the six colors.com version of the website.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:29.200]  If you care enough that I want to make sure I'm not sending an Apple News URL.
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:33.200]  I want to send the original URL on the Mac version.
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:40.500]  You there was no open in Safari and there was no way to copy the link.
[01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:48.100]  It was like one of the first ways I figured out to get a real URL out of it was to copy the URL,
[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:52.600]  which would copy an apple.news slash whatever unique identifier URL.
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:57.900]  And then instead of using Safari go to Chrome and paste it in there
[01:41:57.900 --> 01:42:03.000]  and then it would redirect to the original website because Chrome doesn't know the magic.
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:06.800]  Hey, if it's an Apple News URL open it in Apple News,
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:09.700]  but if you opened it in Safari, it would always take you to Safari.
[01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:13.200]  There was other than using Chrome or some other third-party software.
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:16.400]  There was no way to get the original URL like that's crazy
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:20.100]  and very on Mac like not just limited.
[01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:22.700]  Anyway, I don't know.
[01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:27.400]  I see that stuff as a can it I'm very worried about it to be honest
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:32.100]  that if if this is actually a sign of where Apple thinks,
[01:42:32.100 --> 01:42:37.600]  you know that these are fine examples of Well,
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:40.300]  the other thing is that in the latest version of Mojave,
[01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:44.600]  they added like a file share or copy Safari link button or something.
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:45.400]  I forget what they did.
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:48.000]  I don't use Mojave on a daily basis or forget what it was.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.400]  They added a menu item that does that does give you the original URL.
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:43:00.100]  So there is that it might even still be in the beta version that's not actually shipping.
[01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:02.200]  So anybody out there who's looking in Mojave
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:04.800]  and looking for it while I listen to this maybe it's not there yet,
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:10.100]  but there is a solution in the beta at least but it is not it's not the right solution.
[01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:13.000]  It's certainly not the Mac like one.
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:20.600]  So I'm deeply concerned that these are like they're either some type of prototypes
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:25.500]  that that are that effectively should have been branded as public betas
[01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:30.000]  that we're shipping public betas of these four apps in Mojave Mojave will be shipping
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:38.000]  as a non beta OS in the fall and it will include for public betas of these apps,
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.100]  which they did not say these apps are not branded as public betas.
[01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:47.500]  They are branded as the Mac version of home and news and whatever.
[01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:52.100]  I'm deeply concerned like if the mistake is that they should have been called public betas
[01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:54.000]  and they didn't want to come public betas,
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.300]  but they've got much better ideas for where they're going with this stuff.
[01:43:58.300 --> 01:44:02.200]  Well, then I can't wait, you know, I look forward to hearing about those ideas.
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:05.100]  If these are actually indicative of where Apple thinks Mac apps,
[01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:08.200]  like what makes a reasonable Mac app from Apple,
[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:13.000]  then I'm I've maybe never been more concerned about the future of the platform.
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.200]  Yeah, that's that's the mystery isn't it is did they think these these were okay
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:23.200]  or are they just trying to because the advantage of shipping them is especially for news.
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:27.600]  News is a news is an important platform for them.
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:32.600]  It's an important thing for them to do home right having home kit support is important to Apple.
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:35.600]  I get why you want to get those in Mojave.
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:37.800]  So you can say finally the Mac can do these things.
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:41.300]  I've been I was complaining about no home kit support in the Mac for the last couple of years,
[01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:46.800]  right? So great. It was like when the right it was like when the Mac didn't have Siri for years,
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:49.100]  right? Yeah, exactly. And it's like, you know, okay.
[01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:52.400]  So now now we can do that and and I get it.
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:56.600]  But there is I do think it's an interesting question why they didn't given
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:03.400]  how Apple has really become much more open to branding things as beta shipping beta things
[01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:10.000]  in their operating systems for a while now to not have branded these as a
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:14.200]  a beta or something because I get I hear just like you do I'm sure from people
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:16.300]  when you criticize these apps who say but you know,
[01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:19.400]  it's just a they're just trying it out. It's just new and it's like yeah,
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:21.500]  but they shipped it in the shipping version of the software.
[01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:26.600]  It's not a beta. It's the final version of these apps that ships with the OS.
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:29.700]  So they obviously have some degree of confidence
[01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:31.900]  because they didn't slap that label on it.
[01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:34.700]  And that goes back to your I think concern about the platform,
[01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:40.700]  which is does Apple think that the marzipan apps are are good enough
[01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:42.700]  and I mean, I'm sure they don't
[01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:46.600]  but the question is do they think that they're you know close
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:49.900]  or do they think that they're a completely transitional thing
[01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:53.000]  that the was the only way they were going to get in Mojave,
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:56.900]  but they know that that's not the total solution that's going to come in 2019.
[01:45:56.900 --> 01:45:59.900]  And that's what I kind of assume
[01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:04.100]  but you know it is I although I remain optimistic
[01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:06.300]  that Apple is going to an interesting place here
[01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:08.000]  that could be good for the Mac
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  and good for Apple's platforms overall,
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:15.900]  you know, every transition like this is fraught with peril.
[01:46:15.900 --> 01:46:20.700]  And if you're a Mac user there definitely is a scenario here
[01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:25.500]  where in order to get the iOS stuff over on the Mac,
[01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:28.000]  the Mac kind of gets messed up
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  and that's definitely a possibility
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.300]  and there are probably people inside Apple
[01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:37.000]  whose opinion is basically look the Mac is a legacy platform.
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000]  The old apps aren't going away.
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:42.600]  But if anybody else wants to use this thing any computer-shaped computers
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:43.700]  from us in the future.
[01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:45.500]  We got to have the App Store apps on there.
[01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:47.500]  So we're going to just do this
[01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:52.100]  and the people who care about the Mac as it was 10 years ago can complain
[01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:53.700]  but we you know,
[01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:57.900]  we don't care I don't think I think maybe they don't have the upper hand
[01:46:57.900 --> 01:47:01.500]  because I think that roundtable that you went to suggest
[01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:06.600]  that maybe the Mac attitude has changed at Apple
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:08.600]  and they've kind of reinvigorated themselves
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:10.600]  in terms of letting the Mac be the Mac.
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:13.400]  So that's what that's part of what makes me optimistic here is that
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:17.200]  I think this is Apple solution to keep the Mac relevant
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:20.100]  in instead of what they might have been planning before
[01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:23.300]  which was to just let it sort of float along on its own
[01:47:23.300 --> 01:47:28.000]  until everybody who used it stop buying computers or died.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.800]  So I choose to be optimistic about this
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:33.000]  because of the about face they've done on the Mac
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.300]  and so many other areas the last year and a half.
[01:47:35.300 --> 01:47:42.200]  One of the things that Apple and Next in particular
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:46.500]  the next half of Apple really took a tremendous pride in
[01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:50.700]  and was there really for Next their claim to fame
[01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:55.200]  was the ease with which they allowed rich applications to be created
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:59.900]  compared to what had come before which we now know as Coco,
[01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:02.300]  you know that with the and project builder,
[01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:03.400]  which is now Xcode,
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:08.200]  you know an interface builder that you could drag
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:10.900]  and drop your interface in interface builder
[01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:13.700]  and set constraints with you know tools
[01:48:13.700 --> 01:48:16.200]  that were a lot like the tools in drawing apps,
[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:17.300]  you know with you know,
[01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:19.200]  here's how you set the bounds of a rectangle
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:23.100]  and you can set the style for a label text label and stuff
[01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:27.300]  and that you've got all these things that were built in
[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:29.600]  like here's a rich text editing field.
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:32.100]  So if you want rich text in your app,
[01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:35.700]  like text edit, it was teach text and it was simple text.
[01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:36.400]  Now it's text edit.
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:37.200]  Now it's text edit.
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:38.800]  Jeez, I forgot text edits name.
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:41.800]  Right, but you can get the full power of text edit in any app
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:43.200]  just by dragging the control out,
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:46.300]  you know, and this wasn't like this on the Mac or Windows
[01:48:46.300 --> 01:48:50.300]  and you know, people could make people could write custom apps
[01:48:50.300 --> 01:48:53.800]  or new apps in on the next step system
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:57.800]  with a lot less work and a lot less time.
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:48:58.600]  And they've you know,
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:02.300]  and it was a big part of the eventual success of Mac OS 10
[01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:03.600]  is that it was a great,
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:04.800]  it wasn't just a good platform.
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:08.000]  It was a great platform that really enabled small teams
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.500]  of developers to build really powerful apps
[01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:12.200]  and we see that to this day,
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:16.800]  right where there are apps like you know,
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:20.100]  Acorn is from a friend,
[01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:22.000]  you know, my friend Gus Mueller is,
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.100]  you know, he runs the company with his wife
[01:49:24.100 --> 01:49:26.200]  and Gus is the only developer
[01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:29.600]  and it's a super powerful image editor.
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:31.300]  He's one person.
[01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:32.700]  He's very good.
[01:49:32.700 --> 01:49:34.800]  But it's you know, it would be really,
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:38.500]  really difficult to do that on another platform
[01:49:38.500 --> 01:49:41.000]  because there's so much stuff built into Mac OS 10
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:45.300]  that he can rely on Apple's color management
[01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:46.500]  and stuff like that.
[01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:50.900]  You know, it's a really big difference
[01:49:50.900 --> 01:49:52.500]  from the classic Mac era.
[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:53.600]  Like there was lots of stuff
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:55.200]  I still love about the classic Mac era,
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:58.200]  but there weren't going to be a one man alternative
[01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:00.200]  to Photoshop, you know.
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:02.300]  It just wasn't possible
[01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:04.300]  because there wasn't enough built into the system.
[01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:06.200]  So anyway, Apple's all this is to say
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:07.500]  is Apple has prided itself
[01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:09.500]  not on being a good platform for users,
[01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:12.100]  but that it's a great platform for developers
[01:50:12.100 --> 01:50:15.100]  just in so far as are the tools good
[01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:16.500]  and are the frameworks good.
[01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:21.200]  And you know, the state of the art
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:22.800]  always moves forward, right?
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:26.400]  So my hope would be is both for their internal use
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:29.400]  inside Apple and for third party developers
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:32.800]  writing for their products that they are,
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:34.800]  they've got grand plans inside
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:36.900]  for where's the next way we take this.
[01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:41.000]  So it's not even just here's how Mac apps
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.700]  can be made more easily by iOS developers,
[01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:46.800]  but how can the whole state of the art
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:49.900]  for iOS development be taken to a new level
[01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:51.200]  for a new decade?
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:52.000]  Right.
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:57.000]  So my hope is that their plans are grand like that.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.400]  These four marzipan apps
[01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:00.700]  are not the work of that project.
[01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:03.800]  They may be the work of one tiny leg
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:06.100]  of a many legged stool of that project,
[01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:07.800]  but this is not that.
[01:51:09.300 --> 01:51:11.900]  There's just no sign of it.
[01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:13.000]  Yeah, well, these are also,
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.800]  I think they viewed this all as low-hanging fruit.
[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:17.600]  These are all single window apps, right?
[01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:19.400]  So there's obviously got to be multi window tech.
[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:20.300]  That's part of what sucks about them
[01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:21.800]  is they shouldn't be single window apps.
[01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:23.400]  Why in the world should voice recorder
[01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:24.300]  be a single window app?
[01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:27.400]  Why is Apple News a single window app on the map?
[01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:28.800]  Why can't I double click an article
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:29.800]  to open it in a window?
[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:31.900]  Because I want to keep reading.
[01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:32.900]  You're not wrong.
[01:51:32.900 --> 01:51:35.700]  I want to keep reading new articles
[01:51:35.700 --> 01:51:37.600]  and the answer is that they haven't,
[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:39.300]  either they haven't done that yet
[01:51:39.300 --> 01:51:42.200]  or the part that they did they can't release yet
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:43.800]  because it's part of a bigger something.
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:44.700]  You're right, you're right.
[01:51:44.700 --> 01:51:47.400]  It's insane that Apple News is a single window app.
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:49.900]  I mean, maybe home makes sense as a single window app,
[01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:51.600]  but certainly not Apple News.
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:53.100]  It's ridiculous.
[01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:55.000]  It's really hard to believe.
[01:51:56.600 --> 01:51:59.500]  I don't find it hard to believe that somebody made it.
[01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:00.500]  I don't find it hard to believe
[01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:03.000]  that there are people at Apple
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.600]  whose experience is so thoroughly
[01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:06.400]  on the iOS side of things
[01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:09.900]  and they don't maybe weren't Mac users before
[01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:12.700]  that they would think, you know, as a proof of concept.
[01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:15.000]  Hey, look, I do have, and as a proof of concept,
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.600]  it certainly is interesting, right?
[01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:17.900]  It's certainly worth looking.
[01:52:17.900 --> 01:52:19.500]  If you didn't know about the project
[01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:21.900]  and somebody came up to you and you're a manager at Apple
[01:52:21.900 --> 01:52:23.600]  and somebody said,
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:25.600]  hey, I got Apple News running on the Mac
[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:28.200]  and they showed you what they have right now.
[01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:31.000]  This, this in Mojave.
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.400]  You would certainly say, let's, you know,
[01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:35.300]  I would say let's have a meeting.
[01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:36.800]  This looks interesting, right?
[01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:38.300]  Let's see who should be in a meeting.
[01:52:38.300 --> 01:52:39.600]  Let's talk about this
[01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:42.300]  cause you've got something here, right?
[01:52:42.300 --> 01:52:44.300]  You don't have something shippable,
[01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:47.900]  but you have a very interesting proof of concept.
[01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:51.100]  I find it crazy that that went all the way through
[01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:54.600]  to this is a major part, you know, or not major,
[01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:58.800]  but this is mentionable in the keynote part of Mojave
[01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:02.500]  without somebody in a position of authority saying,
[01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:04.400]  you can't ship this app without support
[01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:07.200]  for multiple windows or opening articles in windows.
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:09.600]  I mean, that's just crazy.
[01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:11.800]  I mean, I, you know, maybe there's, there's no,
[01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:13.500]  again, it's not a written rule.
[01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:15.200]  There's no line in the Hague
[01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:17.000]  that says that a news app has to be able
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.600]  to open articles in multiple windows,
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:22.800]  but it's almost because you didn't have to write it.
[01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:24.300]  That's the whole point of a Mac.
[01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:26.500]  I think the answer is probably
[01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:28.400]  that somebody had to make the decision,
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:30.300]  which is worse, another year
[01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:32.300]  where the Mac doesn't support Apple News
[01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:36.600]  and HomeKit or it supports it with apps
[01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:38.200]  that aren't quite up to our standards
[01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:41.000]  and they made the decision that it was more important.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:44.600]  It's funny too because they didn't need to release these apps
[01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:47.000]  and I wonder sometimes about why they did that
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.700]  because the, so they're like,
[01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:51.400]  okay, well, we can get HomeKit on the Mac,
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:53.100]  but what it's going to take is it's going to take us
[01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:55.300]  to use this translation layer to do it
[01:53:55.300 --> 01:53:57.600]  and it's not going to be a great app, but it'll work.
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:54:01.000]  And, but you know, that the moment we ship this,
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.400]  the first beta, everybody's going to take it apart
[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:05.400]  and realize we have a translation layer
[01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:07.000]  and they're going to freak out.
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:10.200]  So if we do this, we're going to have to say something
[01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:12.300]  because we need to set expectations
[01:54:12.300 --> 01:54:13.700]  because that's the other thing about this
[01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:18.400]  is these four apps required them to have those slides
[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:19.800]  where they talked about how this was something
[01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:21.800]  that they were going to do in a year.
[01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:23.700]  And I feel like that was the imprint
[01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:27.800]  of Steve Trout and Smith on the WWDC keynote.
[01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:31.000]  It's like Apple can't just ship that news app
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.900]  and then go, nobody knows the truth,
[01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:36.200]  which is that it's actually the iOS version
[01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:39.000]  because like within hours, Steve Trout and Smith
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.100]  would pull it apart and say, oh, this is a whole system.
[01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:42.000]  Here's how it works.
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:42.700]  Here's this, right?
[01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:45.100]  So they had to say something about it
[01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:47.600]  or they could have not shipped the apps,
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:51.800]  foregone those features in Mojave and just told, just said,
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:53.500]  oh, we don't know what Mark Gurman's talking about.
[01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:55.200]  We have no idea.
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:57.500]  It's an interesting theory and I don't know.
[01:54:57.500 --> 01:54:59.900]  Again, I really need to start using Mojave
[01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:03.900]  on a daily basis more just to be able to form
[01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:07.500]  and conceal my opinion on this.
[01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:09.100]  But it's possible from what I've seen
[01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:11.100]  that maybe Home was the one that drove it
[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:14.100]  because Home is the one that they kind of needed, right?
[01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:16.300]  Like you didn't have, you couldn't get your Apple News
[01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:21.100]  on your Mac, but it was easy if you were on your iPad
[01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:24.600]  or phone or your watch even and you got the alert.
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:26.400]  If you wanted to read that story on your Mac,
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:27.200]  you could get it.
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:29.500]  It would just open in Safari, right?
[01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:31.600]  As far as I know, part of the rules of Apple News
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:33.400]  is that every single article in Apple News
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:37.400]  is represented by an article on the publisher's website.
[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:40.800]  I don't think there's, I don't, if I'm wrong,
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:42.400]  I'd love to know, but I don't think it's true.
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:44.200]  I don't think there is such a thing.
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.200]  So you weren't missing out on the news
[01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:50.000]  whereas you are missing out on being able
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.700]  to manage your HomeKit stuff.
[01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:56.000]  And we probably won't have time to talk about it,
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.900]  me and you on this show, or at least not in depth,
[01:55:57.900 --> 01:56:00.500]  but I think one of the interesting things for 2019
[01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:02.100]  is I think Apple's HomeKit stuff
[01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:03.500]  is really starting to pay off.
[01:56:03.500 --> 01:56:06.100]  I think they were behind Amazon
[01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:08.700]  and other companies for a while,
[01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:10.200]  you know, based on their security stuff
[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:13.600]  and the way they tried to leverage their MFI influence
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:18.400]  and had more control and therefore everything went slower
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:22.200]  because Amazon's is sort of a Wild West of, you know,
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:24.800]  here's our stuff, you know, ship whatever you want.
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:27.100]  Yeah.
[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:28.400]  But in my personal experience,
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:34.100]  Apple's home stuff is, works better than Amazon's.
[01:56:34.100 --> 01:56:38.300]  Yeah, I've gone from having a whole bunch of Wild West stuff
[01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:40.500]  to wanting everything to be in HomeKit
[01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:42.000]  and using the home app all the time.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:46.800]  And I now run on my Mac mini server that I've got,
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:51.200]  I'm running this command line utility called HomeBridge.
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:52.000]  Oh, really?
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:55.400]  It's basically a, it's a software bridge for HomeKit
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:57.700]  for non-HomeKit compatible apps.
[01:56:57.700 --> 01:57:00.300]  And once I set it up, which, you know,
[01:57:00.300 --> 01:57:02.500]  you got a bunch of config files
[01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:03.800]  and you got to do a bunch of stuff
[01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:07.000]  and import plugins for the various devices you've got.
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  But all of my non-HomeKit compatible devices
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.300]  are now in HomeKit because of that.
[01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:15.400]  And so now, you know, the jig is up.
[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:18.900]  Now I'm basically only using the home app
[01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:21.600]  to control my stuff and it's good.
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:26.600]  Well, and that's the one that was a real obvious gaping hole
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:29.200]  on the Mac is if you're going to throw yourself
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:32.600]  into the Apple ecosystem and you're a good Apple customer
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:35.500]  and you've got a phone and a Mac and maybe an iPad
[01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:37.600]  and you're buying, you know, maybe got Apple TV
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:40.500]  and you're buying HomeKit compatible appliances,
[01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:44.400]  it seems crazy that you couldn't use your Mac to manage it.
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:45.700]  And so I wonder about that.
[01:57:45.700 --> 01:57:48.600]  I wonder if that, I mean, this is absolutely not,
[01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:50.200]  this is just based on your speculation,
[01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:52.600]  but boy, that certainly is an interesting theory.
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:53.900]  I mean, it's just a spit ball,
[01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:55.600]  but it certainly is interesting
[01:57:55.600 --> 01:57:57.500]  that they wanted to ship home.
[01:57:57.500 --> 01:57:59.900]  That was the easiest way to get it.
[01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:02.500]  It's probably the one that it seems the least weird.
[01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:04.600]  It doesn't seem particularly Mac-like.
[01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:07.600]  It's certainly insane to me that the dialogue boxes
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:09.300]  are iOS dialogue boxes.
[01:58:09.300 --> 01:58:11.000]  Oh, when you set a schedule
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.600]  and you have to turn the little iOS tumbler,
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:14.900]  that is the worst.
[01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:15.900]  Right.
[01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:18.100]  I was convinced they were going to fix that
[01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:19.500]  by the time Mojave left beta.
[01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:20.500]  I really was.
[01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:21.500]  And they never did.
[01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:22.500]  I really was too,
[01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:26.300]  because it's a control that it doesn't really make it.
[01:58:26.300 --> 01:58:28.300]  You're not on a touch screen, it makes no sense.
[01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:30.800]  It makes no sense without a touch screen.
[01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:34.200]  It is absolutely insane that to set the schedule,
[01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:36.200]  you get a date picker like iOS.
[01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:37.600]  It is crazy.
[01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:40.000]  I mean, and in terms of if they had shipped that app,
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.800]  you wouldn't have even needed Steven Trout and Smith
[01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:44.400]  or Guillermo Rambo to take it apart
[01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:47.200]  before you knew that it was an iOS app running on a Mac.
[01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:48.200]  Right.
[01:58:48.200 --> 01:58:49.500]  If you click in the right places,
[01:58:49.500 --> 01:58:52.200]  it's very, very clear from the beginning what it is.
[01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:53.200]  Right.
[01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:54.800]  I would sit at my Mac.
[01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:58.200]  I got the light next to my desk on a HomeKit switch.
[01:58:58.200 --> 01:59:00.200]  And I would have those moments where I'd be like,
[01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:02.200]  oh, I need to turn on the light, it's getting dark.
[01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:04.400]  I need to go get my iPhone.
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:06.200]  My Mac can't do this.
[01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:07.200]  I have to go get it.
[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:08.200]  And that sucked.
[01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:10.200]  It's better with Mojave, there's no doubt about it,
[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:11.700]  even if the app is stupid.
[01:59:11.700 --> 01:59:13.200]  Yeah.
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:14.700]  Well, that's an interesting theory.
[01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:16.700]  All right, let me thank my third sponsor,
[01:59:16.700 --> 01:59:18.200]  because we're going long on time here.
[01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:19.700]  It's our good friends, very good friends.
[01:59:19.700 --> 01:59:21.200]  I mean that genuinely, sincerely,
[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:24.200]  because they sponsored my show for a long time,
[01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:25.700]  and they sponsor it very frequently.
[01:59:25.700 --> 01:59:27.700]  It's our good friends at Squarespace.
[01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:29.200]  You've heard of them.
[01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:31.200]  If you've listened to this show before,
[01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:33.700]  it's almost impossible that you haven't at least
[01:59:33.700 --> 01:59:35.700]  caught one episode that they've sponsored.
[01:59:35.700 --> 01:59:37.700]  But they keep sponsoring, because guess what?
[01:59:37.700 --> 01:59:40.700]  People keep signing up with code.
[01:59:40.700 --> 01:59:43.700]  They've got the data to back it up.
[01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:45.700]  And I think what happens is, what are the odds
[01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:50.700]  that you, Joe or Jane, average listener of the talk show,
[01:59:50.700 --> 01:59:55.700]  in late December 2018, need a new website right now?
[01:59:55.700 --> 01:59:57.700]  Yeah, probably pretty low.
[01:59:57.700 --> 01:59:58.700]  But what are the odds you're going
[01:59:58.700 --> 02:00:01.700]  to need a new website sometime next year?
[02:00:01.700 --> 02:00:03.700]  Probably a lot higher.
[02:00:03.700 --> 02:00:05.200]  And I think they keep sponsoring the show,
[02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:06.700]  because it's filed away in your head
[02:00:06.700 --> 02:00:08.700]  that, hey, Gruber keeps saying, if I need a website,
[02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:10.700]  I should try it at Squarespace first.
[02:00:10.700 --> 02:00:13.700]  And people do it, and it's true.
[02:00:13.700 --> 02:00:15.200]  And they get a webinar like, wow,
[02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:17.200]  that was a lot easier than I thought,
[02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:20.200]  and these prices are great.
[02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:23.200]  I guess I'm done.
[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:24.200]  It really is that easy.
[02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:27.200]  And I really think that's the key thing about a, you know.
[02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:29.200]  You might go buy a pillow today, because you maybe
[02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:30.200]  need a new pillow.
[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:32.200]  But you may not need a website right now.
[02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:35.200]  But when you do, you build it at Squarespace,
[02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:36.700]  file it away in your head that that's
[02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:38.200]  where you should try it first.
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:41.200]  Everything is in the Squarespace system.
[02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:43.200]  You just go there, you sign up, and you
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:45.200]  do your design in the browser window.
[02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:48.200]  You do the customization in the browser window.
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:50.200]  You get your analytics right there
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:51.200]  on the Squarespace system.
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:53.200]  And they have great analytics.
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:56.200]  It is truly one of my favorite things about Squarespace,
[02:00:56.200 --> 02:00:59.200]  because I find almost every analytics
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:01.200]  package for like, you know, what's your traffic?
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:02.200]  Where is it coming from?
[02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:04.200]  What's popular on your website?
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:06.200]  I find it to be the most baffling.
[02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:09.200]  It looks like an airplane cockpit type thing.
[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:11.200]  Like, I have no idea how anybody could ever use it.
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:14.200]  You look at Squarespace, and it is like so clean, so
[02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:18.200]  well-designed, so tufted almost in its clarity
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:19.200]  of presentation.
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:21.200]  Really, really one of the great things.
[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:23.200]  They have great customer support.
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:25.200]  They have great technology.
[02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:28.200]  Their websites are rock solid.
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:30.200]  All of the templates you can use to choose from
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:31.200]  are super well-designed.
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:34.200]  They all scale perfectly from giant screens
[02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:36.200]  all the way down to cell phones.
[02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:38.200]  And if you sign up for a whole year,
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:40.200]  you can get a free domain name registration.
[02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:42.200]  So where do you go?
[02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:44.200]  Go to squarespace.com slash talk show.
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:47.200]  Know the, just squarespace.com slash talk show.
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:51.200]  And when you sign up, you get a free trial to start out,
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:52.200]  make sure everything works.
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:55.200]  When you go to sign up, just remember that code, talk show.
[02:01:55.200 --> 02:01:57.200]  Same thing as the URL.
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:01.200]  Know the, and you get 10% off your first purchase.
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:07.200]  My thanks to Squarespace as the final sponsor of this episode.
[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:08.200]  What else?
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:10.200]  We got to talk about keyboards because you can't come on the show
[02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:11.200]  and we don't talk about keyboards.
[02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:12.200]  I know, right?
[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:14.200]  And baseball season is over.
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:15.200]  Baseball season is over.
[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:16.200]  It's keyboard season, I guess.
[02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:17.200]  You know what?
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:19.200]  Can I just tell you one thing about baseball?
[02:02:19.200 --> 02:02:20.200]  Okay, let's do it.
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:21.200]  I love the MLB app.
[02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:22.200]  I do.
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:24.200]  I have the alerts turned on.
[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:25.200]  Same.
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:27.200]  But I know we've talked about this before too.
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:31.200]  I do move it off my first home screen in the off season.
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:32.200]  Sure.
[02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:33.200]  It's over on the home screen too.
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:34.200]  But I still get the news alerts.
[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:39.200]  But in this off season, I would say nine out of 10 of the stories
[02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:44.200]  are conjecture about trades or free agent signings.
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:47.200]  Like who might Manny Machado go to?
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:49.200]  I don't want to read any of those stories.
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:52.200]  I wish, and I don't know how this could be configured in preferences,
[02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:55.200]  but I want to hear about every news.
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:58.200]  Anything that seems like a significant signing from any baseball team,
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:02:59.200]  I would like to hear about it.
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:02.200]  I don't want to read any of the speculation.
[02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:04.200]  Nine out of the 10 alerts are for the speculation.
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:05.200]  And then I ignore them.
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:10.200]  And then I find out like three days after it happens that the Yankees
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:12.200]  resigned J-HAP.
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:13.200]  I'm like, what do you mean they resigned J-HAP?
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:14.200]  I thought he was leaving.
[02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:16.200]  And it's like, well, how did I miss that?
[02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:17.200]  I have the alerts.
[02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:20.200]  But it's because I've trained myself to ignore them.
[02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:22.200]  So it should be on their list.
[02:03:22.200 --> 02:03:26.200]  Like they have very little granularity in their notification setting.
[02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:27.200]  I'm looking at it right now.
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:29.200]  Basically, you could do individual team.
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:34.200]  And then there's news on and off for individual teams
[02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:36.200]  or for general MLB news.
[02:03:36.200 --> 02:03:40.200]  And one of the things that I feel like in this era of iOS 12
[02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:43.200]  and having control over your notifications,
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:47.200]  that Apple needs to even push even more to app developers,
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:49.200]  especially like leading app developers like the MLB app.
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:52.200]  This is always one of the highlighted apps.
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:54.200]  They have a great relationship with Apple.
[02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:57.200]  They need more granularity in their push notifications
[02:03:57.200 --> 02:03:59.200]  for content than they have.
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:00.200]  I actually experienced this.
[02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:04.200]  I actually sent a bug report to the Washington Post
[02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:06.200]  because I had their, this was last year,
[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:09.200]  I had their news alerts turned on
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:13.200]  and they started sending me news alerts that were things like feature stories
[02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:16.200]  or, you know, crossword puzzles or whatever,
[02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:18.200]  like things that are not news alerts.
[02:04:18.200 --> 02:04:21.200]  And I sent them a bug report and I said,
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:27.200]  you guys need to separate your promotional story pushes
[02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:30.200]  from your breaking news headlines.
[02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:34.200]  Because if you don't, I'm just going to turn off notifications
[02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:38.200]  because I, you know, yes, if somebody famous dies
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:41.200]  and you want to send out a push, I want to see that.
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:42.200]  You can depress me.
[02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:43.200]  I get those.
[02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:46.200]  There was a point last year over the holidays actually
[02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:50.200]  where like I got two push notifications a day from the Washington Post
[02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:52.200]  and they were the most depressing things.
[02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:53.200]  But it's like I signed up for it.
[02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:54.200]  It's fine.
[02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:58.200]  But what I don't want is we also have recipes for Christmas Eve.
[02:04:58.200 --> 02:05:01.200]  It's like if people want that, that's great.
[02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:02.200]  If they want to get the feature story headlines,
[02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:05.200]  I think the New York Times and Washington Post both do this now
[02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:09.200]  where you can say, do you want featured stories
[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:11.200]  or do you just want breaking news?
[02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:13.200]  And that's what MLB needs.
[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:19.200]  It needs like news needs to be broken up into like news that happens.
[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:26.200]  And then like other stories because those rumor roundups are not news per se.
[02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:28.200]  I mean, I guess they can be qualified as that,
[02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:32.200]  but I get what you're saying is that all push notification apps
[02:05:32.200 --> 02:05:33.200]  should have more granularity.
[02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:36.200]  The problem is that most of them are like, well, yeah,
[02:05:36.200 --> 02:05:43.200]  but really we use this to feed them that and we want them in the same pipe.
[02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:45.200]  But as a user, I want to be able to turn that off
[02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:48.200]  because I don't want the recipe push notifications.
[02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:50.200]  I just want the headlines.
[02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:51.200]  The Post does a good job.
[02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:57.200]  I feel like the two news organizations I have that are allowed to send me,
[02:05:57.200 --> 02:05:59.200]  well, three actually, it's three organizations.
[02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:03.200]  The three things that send me news are the New York Times,
[02:06:03.200 --> 02:06:09.200]  the Washington Post, I pay for subscriptions to both, and Apple News.
[02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:12.200]  And Apple News is the one that annoys me the least.
[02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:16.200]  And I know there was a feature story recently about the editorial team
[02:06:16.200 --> 02:06:18.200]  that they've assembled there.
[02:06:18.200 --> 02:06:20.200]  It's a really big editorial team.
[02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:23.200]  And of course, there was somebody who was a managing editor
[02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:26.200]  who asked not to be named.
[02:06:26.200 --> 02:06:29.200]  It was like only at Apple would somebody be the managing editor
[02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:33.200]  of a news publication and not want their name used.
[02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:36.200]  Just because they don't want it, they just don't want their name.
[02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:39.200]  It wasn't because he or she had a quote that was damning.
[02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:45.200]  It was like, I want to work in secrecy because I'm at Apple.
[02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:49.200]  The Times is the one that lately has been leaking, to me at least,
[02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:52.200]  a lot more like, why the fuck are you giving me an alert for this?
[02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:58.200]  I don't want to hear about what's new in gingerbread man frosting in 2018.
[02:06:58.200 --> 02:06:59.200]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:01.200]  So the Post, and I'm not taking credit for this,
[02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:05.200]  but at some point after I complained about this, they actually did do this.
[02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:09.200]  The Post's push alert settings are breaking news, editor's picks,
[02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:12.200]  and then politics, opinion, the sections.
[02:07:12.200 --> 02:07:15.200]  And they've separated editor's picks and breaking news,
[02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:20.200]  and they actually say the frequency, expect a few daily, expect a few weekly.
[02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:23.200]  But this is the thing where I was able to turn off the editor's picks,
[02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:26.200]  which means that I'm not getting those feature story things,
[02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:28.200]  which if I open the app, I'll see your feature stories,
[02:07:28.200 --> 02:07:30.200]  but I don't want to get the push notification.
[02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:32.200]  And that's the right way to do it.
[02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:34.200]  Hey, did you see the story while we're talking about it?
[02:07:34.200 --> 02:07:37.200]  Did you see the controversy, mini controversy that erupted last week
[02:07:37.200 --> 02:07:40.200]  where Apple sent out some promotional push notifications
[02:07:40.200 --> 02:07:43.200]  for a new episode of Carpool Karaoke?
[02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:46.200]  I did see that. I did see that.
[02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:49.200]  By the way, The Times also has a breaking news top stories thing,
[02:07:49.200 --> 02:07:50.200]  so you can do the same.
[02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:52.200]  I think I got to adjust that. I got to get in there and adjust it.
[02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:56.200]  Yeah, you know, people hate that because technically in the guidelines
[02:07:56.200 --> 02:07:58.200]  there are certain push notifications you're not supposed to send,
[02:07:58.200 --> 02:08:03.200]  but I didn't please anybody by saying I don't think it's a big deal
[02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:07.200]  because if they're pushing Apple Music subscribers about a new piece of content
[02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:09.200]  that's available to Apple Music subscribers,
[02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:12.200]  Netflix does that to me all the time where they're like,
[02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:14.200]  oh, here's a new show for you.
[02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:17.200]  And I should turn that notification off because it's never valuable.
[02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:20.200]  But that's reasonable.
[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:24.200]  Netflix for me is often not valuable,
[02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:28.200]  but it's infrequent enough that I don't mind.
[02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:32.200]  I know that there are some purists out there who really don't want any notification.
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:35.200]  One, I didn't want this notification.
[02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:37.200]  It really is like a grain of sand in their eye,
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:41.200]  that they keep their notifications very neat and orderly.
[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:46.200]  My notifications are more like the pile of junk mail.
[02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:50.200]  I shouldn't say that, but I get way more notifications than I read.
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:55.200]  But with the iOS 11, or was it only recently with 12?
[02:08:55.200 --> 02:08:56.200]  It's 12.
[02:08:56.200 --> 02:08:57.200]  12, so it's that recent.
[02:08:57.200 --> 02:09:00.200]  I've become so used to it that I'm fine with it.
[02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:04.200]  Dieter Bohn and I talked about this in a recent episode
[02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:06.200]  where he still prefers the Google style,
[02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:10.200]  but the Google style to me drives me nuts because it doesn't show me enough information.
[02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:16.200]  But the way that I could have 20 notifications from At Bat
[02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:19.200]  and they show up in one stack in the list,
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:22.200]  it doesn't look like they're badgering me because it's all neatly organized,
[02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:28.200]  and I only have to scroll past the most recent one if I want.
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:35.200]  Anyway, the Apple News one, or not Apple News, the Apple Carpool Karaoke one.
[02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:37.200]  I don't know why people went nuts for it.
[02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:42.200]  It's also weird because Carpool Karaoke isn't something Apple even sells.
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:44.200]  You just get it for free.
[02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:49.200]  Well, it's part of your Apple Music subscription, I think, is how that works.
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:51.200]  Oh, you have to have Apple Music? Is that what it is now?
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:52.200]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:54.200]  All right, so you do have to have Apple Music.
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:57.200]  But then you only got that notification if you have Apple Music.
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:10:00.200]  I think that's the idea, and that seems less offensive to me.
[02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:03.200]  But I think the answer is people don't like Carpool Karaoke.
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:06.200]  It's a representative of, like, the old Apple TV culture
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:09.200]  before they hired the new TV people.
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:11.200]  It's a video show in a music service.
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:15.200]  It is music-related, but it is a video show in a music service,
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:17.200]  so a lot of people feel it's kind of off-brand.
[02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:22.200]  And then there are a lot of nerds who are angry because they feel like
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:26.200]  this is Apple abusing their privilege in a way that third-party developers aren't.
[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:30.200]  I get all the reasons, but to me I kind of gave it a shrug, like,
[02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:34.200]  turn off your notifications for Apple Music for Pete's sake.
[02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:38.200]  Well, and there's actually one of three that you can turn off to stop getting those.
[02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:41.200]  Like, you can still, you know, you don't have to turn off all of them.
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:43.200]  You can still get notified for other things you might want
[02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:45.200]  that aren't just promotional things.
[02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:50.200]  But I do think there's something particular about Apple using its position
[02:10:50.200 --> 02:10:53.200]  to do this that is a bad look.
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:56.200]  It's a default app, and those notifications are turned on by default,
[02:10:56.200 --> 02:10:59.200]  whereas a third-party app would have to ask you for notification power.
[02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:05.200]  Yeah, so it's like you did somehow technically opt into it, or maybe, you know.
[02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:09.200]  Yeah, but not really. I don't think when you launch Apple Music for the first time,
[02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:12.200]  the music app, it says, would you like us to notify you?
[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:15.200]  It's like, yes, we are going to notify you. We are Apple.
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:25.200]  Yeah, and it all falls under, I mean, the primary example of it is the U2 album, right?
[02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:26.200]  Sure.
[02:11:26.200 --> 02:11:31.200]  I mean, you know, we've worked out a deal with U2, and guess what?
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:35.200]  You're already getting the album. It's being sent to your devices right now,
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:39.200]  and people really did not like that, for good reason.
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:44.200]  I kind of do see how that one got approved because I kind of see how it was like,
[02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:47.200]  you know, they're a huge band. Lots of people do like them.
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:51.200]  I'm sure many, many, many people appreciated getting the free album,
[02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:54.200]  and they just didn't think to say anything publicly about it
[02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:56.200]  because they're like, cool, free album.
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:12:00.200]  Whereas the people who did not appreciate the free album
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:03.200]  and had it forced on them found it offensive.
[02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:05.200]  And, you know, there's a certain tone-def.
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:08.200]  I could see how they were tone-def to that thinking.
[02:12:08.200 --> 02:12:11.200]  They were excited, like, hey, everybody gets a free album. Isn't that great?
[02:12:11.200 --> 02:12:16.200]  And didn't think about that people viewed that as their personal space
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:21.200]  that was being cluttered by a corporate synergy thing, right?
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:26.200]  And it pushes notifications like that. I mean, you're watching a movie,
[02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:30.200]  or you're doing something on your personal device, and a little bubble pops up.
[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:34.200]  And if it's something that is super intrusive and not at all relevant to you,
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:36.200]  of course you're going to be turned off by that.
[02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:40.200]  So if I got that carpool karaoke notification, I would have felt the same way.
[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:44.200]  The one I got, I've seen at least two screenshots of the carpool karaoke one.
[02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:49.200]  I got it. My wife did not. I don't think my son did either.
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:54.200]  Maybe it's because I'm the one who subscribed to Apple Music. It might be.
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:56.200]  Even though we share it with the family.
[02:12:56.200 --> 02:13:01.200]  But the one I got, it said, like, new episode of carpool karaoke,
[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:06.200]  FT period Jason Sudeikis and the Muppets.
[02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:11.200]  And it took me, it took me, like, the part that annoyed me about it wasn't that I got the notification.
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:15.200]  It was that I couldn't understand what Fort Jason Sudeikis is.
[02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:19.200]  I swear to God, I was like, what the hell does this even mean?
[02:13:19.200 --> 02:13:25.200]  It's like when a, when a, that's music lingo, right? For when somebody guests on a track and they do the featuring.
[02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:28.200]  See, I didn't know that. I didn't even know that was music lingo.
[02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:30.200]  I was like this. I didn't even know that that's a word.
[02:13:30.200 --> 02:13:35.200]  I've never seen that word abbreviated before, or at least not in a context where I didn't understand it.
[02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:38.200]  Like, why not write out the word featuring?
[02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:44.200]  I spent a long time thinking about what Fort Jason was.
[02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:49.200]  It's where we all live. That's where you live, at least all the Jason's. All right.
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:54.200]  One more serious conversation. I can't let you go. I know we've stretched this on and it's the holiday season, whatever.
[02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:56.200]  But I want to, I want to mention something because if I don't,
[02:13:56.200 --> 02:14:08.200]  I'm never going to forgive myself because it ties into so much of what we talked about with that whole Mac likeness thing and the way that Photoshop could be created in a Mac like way,
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:16.200]  even though it was going so much deeper than Apple's own system type apps did.
[02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:21.200]  Here's my frustration with the iPad or one of one of my frustrations with the iPad.
[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:29.200]  I don't think there is such clarity as to what makes a good blank app on iOS.
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:37.200]  Like I look at the writing apps or let's just say the markdown writing apps, which is crazily enough to me.
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:43.200]  Like literally a category and they're all over the map.
[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:50.200]  Yeah. They're all over the map in terms of what they do, how they do it and, and missing features.
[02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:58.200]  I don't want to slag anybody, but there was one I just tried that looked interesting and I tried it and I downloaded it.
[02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:02.200]  And I swear to God, the first thing I tried was command F to see how that,
[02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:07.200]  how did they do find because this seems like an unsolved problem on iOS and guess what?
[02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:12.200]  It did nothing. There is no find like.
[02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:20.200]  Yeah. Yeah. And I get it, you know, like Vesper didn't have it sort of had search, but I didn't have search within a note.
[02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:26.200]  Right. Like not command F search. You know, you could search for your list of notes to find string, of course.
[02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:34.200]  And I'm sure this app supported something like that in the source list, but that's a notes app, not a text editor.
[02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:43.200]  Right. For like writing articles like you can't have an article. You can't have a thing that's meant for serious writing where you can't search in the article.
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:53.200]  Yeah, it's a it's definitely a problem. I think one of the reasons there are so many markdown apps is that it's easier to do a plain text editor than a style text editor, to be honest.
[02:15:53.200 --> 02:16:00.200]  And so that they're like, oh, well, this is great. Markdown text editor file access. We're done. Maybe maybe you got.
[02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:08.200]  And not all of them are like that. There are a lot that are much more sophisticated than that. But I feel like that's one of the reasons that people said, oh, I can make one of those.
[02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:15.200]  And then you're right. Like all the other features are hard. And some of them I forget whether it's is it.
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:20.200]  So I use one writer for the most part. And I think it's search is implemented.
[02:16:20.200 --> 02:16:28.200]  I'm not sure whether it's search. There's there's an app I've used for Markdown where the search is implemented basically as a plug in because it's got a macro language behind it.
[02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:32.200]  And I can't remember whether it's one writer or editorial.
[02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:43.200]  And I always thought that was one of the most bizarre things that you would not consider a part of your core app to do search and instead would have it be like an add on macro that does search.
[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:57.200]  Because it's like it seems so fundamental to it. And that's the stuff I miss the most. I got to be honest. The stuff I miss the most on iOS when I'm writing is stuff like like grep, like search and replace with pattern matching if I want it.
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:17:05.200]  That stuff is a lot harder to come by. There are apps that do it, but they all they all have other issues like, you know, draft does a bunch of stuff.
[02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:19.200]  Ulysses does a bunch of stuff with Markdown, but I don't like its approach because it sort of translates the Markdown into more of a word processor like kind of object thing where you can't see the link, which I don't like because I want to see the link.
[02:17:19.200 --> 02:17:31.200]  So it's just, you know, it's one of those things where whenever I write about writing about this stuff, writing about writing on iOS, I have to have to put in all these caveats.
[02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:43.200]  I have to say the app I'm using now is and part of that is that for a while the app I was using was editorial and now it's one writer and and I'm just not that invested in one writer like it's okay.
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:54.200]  It works with my workflow. It you can point it at a particular folder in Dropbox where which I've set to be where I use default folder on the Mac to make that my default for bbedit.
[02:17:54.200 --> 02:18:01.200]  All of my files that I'm working on go in that folder and I can see them in both places and because it's all text that's great.
[02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:05.200]  But do I love one writer do I think it solves all of these problems?
[02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:14.200]  It absolutely doesn't there isn't you know, and and if somebody came up with one tomorrow if Federico Vitici tomorrow emailed me and said did you see this text editor?
[02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:19.200]  I would absolutely buy it and download it and try it and if it was better, I would throw the current app.
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:26.200]  I'm using to the curb immediately like I there's no loyalty here because none of them are good enough to have built up loyalty.
[02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:37.200]  And I do I think part of the problem is Apple shoulders is that I don't think Apple has well defined enough just what it means to be a good iPad app.
[02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:48.200]  I really do and and just in a I know it when I see it kind of way, you know, I that's one of my hopes for 2019 when I talk about this idea of the unified app platform.
[02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:50.200]  That might be coming.
[02:18:50.200 --> 02:19:07.200]  I mean part of my hope as an iPad user is that they are going to do the work to define what apps should do on large screen devices, including iPads and Mac laptops because right 2 thirds to 3 quarters of the max that are sold their laptops.
[02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:20.200]  So basically a hundred percent of the iPads are between or well, you know are between 9 and 13 inches right in that in that range if we if we include the smaller iPads.
[02:19:20.200 --> 02:19:34.200]  I mean, I guess other than the iPad mini which is maybe coming back but most iPads are you know in the 9 to 13 space and all or what 3 quarters of max sold are between 12 and 15 inch displays.
[02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:37.200]  They're all kind of in the same ballpark.
[02:19:37.200 --> 02:20:02.200]  And what I'd like is for part of this unified approach to apps to be not stuff that just is like how do we make iOS apps feel like Mac apps on the Mac but also like how do we make iPad apps feel more unified and functional and can iPad apps pick up some of the some of the attributes of Mac apps
[02:20:02.200 --> 02:20:31.200]  because the problems I mean the devices are different but the problems and the screen sizes are not that different and and so I talked to Federico about this and to Mike Hurley about this like I think potentially you could get like better keyboard shortcut support potentially like pointing device support potentially something that's the iOS equivalent of a menu bar like I feel like this is an opportunity for Apple to make iPad apps richer and more powerful.
[02:20:31.200 --> 02:20:39.200]  To as a part of the process that is bringing them to the Mac, which is a platform that wants them to be more powerful.
[02:20:39.200 --> 02:20:57.200]  Yeah, I mentioned that recently that like the I work apps like numbers numbers is the one I use the most and put pages and they all have it but there's the iPad versions have like a dot dot dot button that opens a popover and the popover is full of items.
[02:20:57.200 --> 02:21:12.200]  Some of them have sub by some menus. It's a menu bar like yeah exactly is that the way to do it in a dot dot dot menu. I don't think so, but if it is the nation's they should say so right and encourage think about could they just do a menu bar on the iPad.
[02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:39.200]  I think the answer is probably no but but if not then it's like well, what could you do that gives you the kind of discoverability and the density of access to features that the Mac menu bar gives you and if you can do that and it's not a menu bar and it's still good then then great but there are every now and then because I use numbers on iOS a lot and on the Mac and every now and then you're like, oh, I think I've reached the end.
[02:21:39.200 --> 02:21:53.200]  I think I can't actually get to this feature on iOS and there's no real good reason other than I think they ran out of user interface or some other features and it's like that's not good enough. You should be able to get to those features on iOS.
[02:21:53.200 --> 02:22:22.200]  Yeah, and one of the things I worry about is that they're they're not just putting figuring out how to do a menu bar on the on iPad and be done with it is out of stubbornness and you know, because they don't want to do it. They don't want to do a menu bar and you know about menu bars is they're not cool right there text and they're just you know, a bunch of words for the menu names and a bunch of words for the menu items, you know in a list and but guess what?
[02:22:22.200 --> 02:22:32.200]  Text is actually very information depth rich, you know, it's it's there's there's a density right the information density of the Mac menu bar is tremendous.
[02:22:32.200 --> 02:22:48.200]  It's enormous. It is the best place. It's the most I think revolutionary and maybe undersold thing about the Mac interface when it started was the fact that every feature that was available in any given app was discoverable by going through the menus and that there were you could have submenus.
[02:22:48.200 --> 02:23:10.200]  There was an incredible level of detail and while you're navigating the menus you're you can't get lost right the way that you get out as you just move your mouse away and that's it, you know, it's it was it was it was a very dense and it wasn't you couldn't get lost and you I don't know there's something like that that's missing.
[02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:38.200]  Yeah, I agree. I agree. I mean part of me thinks that the solution is to do something that's very much like the menu bar but I'm and I hope again in my kind of optimism about this that at Apple they've had this discussion of how do we do something that can float all of those kind of features out there somewhere in a way that makes sense on touch interfaces and make sense on Mac, you know traditional pointing device driven interfaces.
[02:23:38.200 --> 02:24:00.200]  I also sometimes toy with the idea that what they're going to end up doing is saying hey now that we've built iOS apps that also have menu bars if you plug in a mouse to your iPad will just show that show you the menu menu bar and you can just use like okay, that would be weird and I think it's probably the wrong decision right to to revisit the Mac interface convention on a new device.
[02:24:00.200 --> 02:24:17.200]  But you know, again, they need to that means they need to invent something that's more appropriate that still has that density and power. I'll give you another example is photos. So photos for Mac came out a couple years ago and was obviously, you know, replaced.
[02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:37.200]  I photo in a weird way in a way that Apple often doesn't do which is and you know in rare cases Apple will keep an old app around and introduce the new one like I thought you could still run iPhoto right now. There probably are people still using iPhoto because it's too different and the paradigm is too different etc.
[02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:57.200]  So they stopped updating iPhoto but or is it five photos? I don't remember anymore. I photo photo photo photos for Mac, which is shares the and the very best feature of it and in my personal experience as a thorough user of the iCloud photo system.
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:25:13.200]  It is a to me a rock has been for a couple of years now and very rock solid photo syncing system that is both reliable and works fast. And so my photos are everywhere on all my devices.
[02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:28.200]  Photos for Mac is sort of an iOS ish looking app, but it's not like the marzipan apps and I believe if I'm remembering correctly people who dug within it, you know, like Steven Trouton Smith style found something called UX kit.
[02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:48.200]  Yeah, some people thought might be that might be the holy grail that you and I were speculating about an hour ago that UX kit could be the UI kit for the Mac and it I think it turns out either it was and they decided to just leave it with photos or it was just something the photos team made to get that, you know, it was and they just picked that name.
[02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:57.200]  Like nothing further has come of that there have been no further apps that are on the Mac what photos is for the Mac.
[02:25:57.200 --> 02:26:11.200]  But there's also and I have gripes about some of the iOS ish ness of photos on Mac, but none of them to the to the level of outrage and, and I cannot, you know, WTF that the marzipan stuff is filed under there's something different there.
[02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:34.200]  But one aspect of it like that some ways the familiarity is nice right like and the one that hit me just recently because I've been trying to I for a bunch of reasons I've been using my iPad Pro a lot recently and just visually it is helpful for me like at the current place where my vision is between the two eyes it is really helpful for me to have a screen very close to my face.
[02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:53.200]  And guess which big screen is the easiest to get close to my face. It's the iPad. It is really easy. It is a really almost eye watering accessibility advantage to be able to sit comfortably and read a nice big screen very close to my face.
[02:26:53.200 --> 02:27:06.200]  And I went to edit some photos and I wanted to make some adjustments beyond the very basic ones. And I was like, What the hell where they move these two words like this, those things that you stopped, and I realized they're only on the Mac version.
[02:27:06.200 --> 02:27:21.200]  You know what I mean you go into edit mode on the Mac, and there's more than just filters you can apply there's like individual things you can pop open with disclosure triangles to tie in another topic from conversation earlier in the show with detailed things specifically
[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:29.200]  like if you just want to adjust the brightness or the contrast or something like that or the exposure level. There's a whole bunch of features I did that are only on the Mac version.
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:35.200]  And I was like well that's crazy because isn't the iPad the one that's supposed to be getting all the attention.
[02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:50.200]  Anyway, that just drove me nuts and I'm sure Apple, they know about it, but it was crazy to me because I really spent like two minutes looking for how to do it on the iPad before I remembered that you can't because I, the iPad seems like it should be able to do everything the Mac version does in that regard.
[02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:57.200]  Oh, I you know, I agree that's with with photos since I wrote a book about it for take control.
[02:27:57.200 --> 02:28:09.200]  And so I compare and contrast the iOS version and the Mac version and it's fascinating all the ways that they don't sync up and you know, I I can complain about the Mac version not having the new search feature that they added to iOS.
[02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:18.200]  It drives me crazy because it's such a it's such a useful thing and you know, you can't you can't search for show me all the photos with snow and dogs like you can't but you can do that on iOS.
[02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:27.200]  But iOS is lacking all sorts of editing features that are in the Mac version and on my iPad like why are those not there?
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:40.200]  There's no I don't understand why I can't do all the same editing things that I can do on my Mac on my iPad and and there's no good reason for it, which is it's funny that that also means my standards have changed where it used to be kind of like well, I understand it.
[02:28:40.200 --> 02:28:52.200]  This is kind of the light version of that and I'm I have left that era behind. I'm like, why is this not here? The Apple rolls out this new iPad and says it's faster than most of the laptops that are sold now and more powerful.
[02:28:52.200 --> 02:29:06.200]  It's like, all right. Well, then why can't I edit my photos in the same way on this thing? Yeah, it's really comes down to screen size, right? Like I totally get it with the iPhone, you know, like I even with the you know, what's the super-sized XS Max, you know, get the iPhone XS Max.
[02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:14.200]  It's still it's you know, it's a tiny screen. I get it. You maybe there's some advanced editing controls that you just don't want to figure out how to scram them on the screen.
[02:29:14.200 --> 02:29:30.200]  But there's you know, the iPad 11 and 11 and 13 inch screens are plenty big enough for it. Yeah. I mean, I use my MacBook Air as an 11. This iPad's got a way bigger screen than that. There's plenty of room.
[02:29:30.200 --> 02:29:53.200]  I have that book. I have take control of photos for Mac. I saw my Christmas reading list because I will tell you I'm coming at it as somebody who I know the Mac version pretty thoroughly and like I have no idea about like searching on the iOS version like I think I'm I hope I'm in for a pleasant surprise on the degree to which Apple photos are actually searchable because I'm
[02:29:53.200 --> 02:30:05.200]  They are I mean on the iOS they don't let you do like smart albums and stuff, but you can you can stack up these queries in ways that I mean the example I give in the book is that I said search for dogs and it's got like 800 pictures of dogs.
[02:30:05.200 --> 02:30:19.200]  But I'm looking for this picture of the time that we took my dog up to the mountains and she was like the only time she was in the snow and so then on iOS you to search for dogs and you're like, all right dogs and then you just type snow and then tap on the on the snow and then it's like here's two pictures.
[02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:29.200]  There they are. Those are the two pictures of dogs and snow and it is the picture I wanted of my dog in the snow. It's like yes, that is how this is supposed to work.
[02:30:29.200 --> 02:30:41.200]  Briefly quick hits before we talk about your keyboard. I think that that searching stuff it ties into one last thing. I definitely wanted to mention on the show with you is is the thing I linked to you.
[02:30:41.200 --> 02:30:52.200]  Well, two bits of news that I thought were curiously came out the same morning this week was Apple's promotion of John, John, Andrea to a senior vice president level.
[02:30:52.200 --> 02:31:02.200]  I can't help but think because he's only been there since summer and he came from Google where he headed up summer. I was actually surprised when they hired him that he didn't start with a senior vice president title.
[02:31:02.200 --> 02:31:11.200]  And I just wonder if maybe it's policy now that some new hires even at that level. Let's see how this works out. Let's see if you're a fit.
[02:31:11.200 --> 02:31:18.200]  Like I can't help but think that that was the plan all along. It's like, okay, you're going to leave Google. You're going to join us for here's a big pile of money.
[02:31:18.200 --> 02:31:26.200]  Let's see how this works. And it's worked apparently well. And now he's promoted to senior vice president level because his job's the same.
[02:31:26.200 --> 02:31:37.200]  He started as the head of AI and machine learning. And the other bit of news was Loop Ventures. That's Gene Munster's outfit runs to me.
[02:31:37.200 --> 02:31:41.200]  I don't know. I mean, maybe I don't know how rigorous it is, but it sounds to me pretty interesting.
[02:31:41.200 --> 02:31:53.200]  They've run they've two years in a row. They've run these battery of eight hundred tests comparing Google's and Amazon's and Apple's speakers and what they can do and what type of questions they can do.
[02:31:53.200 --> 02:32:01.200]  And the really interesting thing to me is probably surprised to know when Google Assistant was still the most capable.
[02:32:01.200 --> 02:32:10.200]  And they all improved over the last year. But Siri improved by far the most. Like, well, you know, like Google Assistant got like seven percent more questions.
[02:32:10.200 --> 02:32:20.200]  Right. Siri improved 22 percent and series wasn't even 12 months. It was nine months because the HomePod didn't ship until nine months ago.
[02:32:20.200 --> 02:32:32.200]  Right. And basically my theory, and I really think it's true, is I think Siri is getting a lot better in every way. Understanding you capabilities.
[02:32:32.200 --> 02:32:43.200]  And I think it's catching up to Google. I don't think that I don't think John, John, Andrea would have taken the job if their goal was any less than to catch or exceed Google in these areas.
[02:32:43.200 --> 02:32:56.200]  You know, I really think it's that serious. But I think Apple has a huge perception problem. I call it a boy who cries wolf problem where I think a lot of people hear the word Siri and they think that doesn't work.
[02:32:56.200 --> 02:33:08.200]  And that's it. And they filed it under. And it's it's the way that like first impressions can last a lifetime. Like people filed Siri under a thing that doesn't work. And I shouldn't bother trying.
[02:33:08.200 --> 02:33:19.200]  I think you're right. I think a lot of people. You know, once you're burned, you just just walk away and it's hard to get people to reengage and to give it another try.
[02:33:19.200 --> 02:33:29.200]  And so with Siri, you know, I almost think that what they need to do, and this is what they should have been doing all along, is keep improving it in the background.
[02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:40.200]  And then you'll have a release or a new feature or something that you make available that lets you have say, hey, we added a bunch of new things to Siri and it's way better than it used to be.
[02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:46.200]  Give it another try. But they're going to need a marketing moment where they try to convince people to give it another try.
[02:33:46.200 --> 02:33:55.200]  Right. In the background, it needs to have gotten a lot better in the meantime so that they can actually they actually have something that's better to tell people to try.
[02:33:55.200 --> 02:34:02.200]  I think it's I think it is evident just from the loop ventures thing that they are, in fact, doing that and rolling out iterative updates.
[02:34:02.200 --> 02:34:13.200]  But it also meshes with my personal experience using these things, that it is getting better, not just with OS updates or with features that are get announced once a year at WWDC,
[02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:25.200]  but that it is, you know, Google style just under continuous improvement. And when something an improvement is deemed ready to ship, it is rolled out on their back end.
[02:34:25.200 --> 02:34:37.200]  Yeah, that's the right way to do it, right? It's cloud. It's cloud features. But then at some point, perhaps there's a marketing feature that they hold off on and announce somewhere and and use it as a way to, you know, ask people to give it a new try.
[02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:44.200]  Give it another another go because, you know, they know it's got a reputation. They're not they're not dumb. They're aware of Siri's reputation.
[02:34:44.200 --> 02:34:49.200]  Yeah, I think you're right that they've got to hold off on, you know, some kind of new integration with the thing.
[02:34:49.200 --> 02:34:57.200]  I don't know what it would be, but so that they can say it or maybe, you know, maybe it's, you know, maybe it's, you know, good old fashioned advertising campaign, right?
[02:34:57.200 --> 02:35:06.200]  Right. Could be, you know, just throw money at it and do make clever commercials and get them everywhere and, you know, try to make it a thing.
[02:35:06.200 --> 02:35:16.200]  But I know something has to be done in addition to just making it better. Something has to be done perception wise because the better the getting better isn't enough because people won't notice if they don't try it.
[02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:25.200]  And it's like you and you don't accidentally try it, right? I mean, you could actually people only know that they remember the failures to that's the other part of it.
[02:35:25.200 --> 02:35:37.200]  Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. The time that you asked to go to the pizza place you go to all the time and it gave you directions to North Carolina.
[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:48.200]  I got directions. I went to we went Christmas tree shopping a couple weeks ago and I forget the name of the place. Lynn Vola Farms or something. It's, you know, suburban Philadelphia.
[02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:59.200]  And I asked Siri for directions because we go once a year and the road sometimes change and you want to get the traffic. So, you know, I kind of know how to get there anyway.
[02:35:59.200 --> 02:36:12.200]  And I know that you get there by starting going south on 95 out of the city. And that was the directions I was following. And then we kept going and then we wound up across the state line into Delaware.
[02:36:12.200 --> 02:36:23.200]  We got we got to the welcome to Delaware sign and I was like, you know, I kind of thought we missed the exit and then we checked and we were going to someplace with a similar name in North Carolina.
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:33.200]  That one still gets me. And that's that's, you know, because maps is the same story as Siri where you remember the failures and they need to keep getting better and try to find ways to get people to try it again.
[02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:46.200]  And that's the that's the maps failure that comes up a lot that I still can't believe that they haven't fixed, which is if if it knows your location and you do a search, you'd be really aggressive that they're trying to find something near you.
[02:36:46.200 --> 02:36:55.200]  Please pick the thing that's sort of like this in Pennsylvania and not the thing that is like it, but in North Carolina, because I'm probably not asking about North Carolina.
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:37:06.200]  Yeah. And the way that these things fall short in so many ways. And I think we'll get there faster than when we all think. I think it's that old that a whole Bill Gates thing.
[02:37:06.200 --> 02:37:17.200]  And maybe he didn't originate the line, but that technology progresses way more slowly year after year than we ever think and way faster every 10 years than we think.
[02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:26.200]  You know that you look at it year over year and it never seems like we're getting anywhere and you look back 10 years and you're like, holy crap, that was crude. I think, you know, we'll have that sort of moment with this stuff.
[02:37:26.200 --> 02:37:38.200]  But like if you got in an Uber or a Lyft and said to the driver, take me to a Christmas tree farm in North Carolina and you live in Philadelphia, they're going to double check before they take off. Right.
[02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:52.200]  Yeah. You can have that conversation very quickly. You know, that conversation doesn't happen when you talk to Apple maps, right? There is no double checking of the ridiculous.
[02:37:52.200 --> 02:37:59.200]  Are you sure you want to drive cross country as opposed to driving 22 minutes out of the city?
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:07.200]  Makes me want to get an Uber and see what they would say if I tried to go to North Carolina. All right. What's your current keyboard, Jason?
[02:38:07.200 --> 02:38:19.200]  I am using a Vortex Race 3, which is a I think what they call a 75% keyboard. It's mechanical keys. I use the Cherry Brown switches because I like those. It's but it's small. It's got no keypad.
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:31.200]  It does have a function key row. So it's and it has dedicated arrow keys a lot. When we talk about these keyboards, you and I, people send links to things that don't have arrow keys and like, yeah, you can hold on like the function key and move around with the arrow key things that are arrow keys.
[02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:41.200]  And it's like, no, I'm not interested in that. I want I want arrow keys. I've spent my entire life with arrow keys. I want dedicated keys to move around my cursor around on the screen.
[02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:52.200]  And it's it's pretty nice. It's, you know, it's just a USB keyboard. But having that extra function row is nice just for controlling, you know, media brightness, stuff like that.
[02:38:52.200 --> 02:39:10.200]  And it comes with Mac key caps, which often these keyboards don't. And, you know, it's programmable. So you can put it into Mac mode. And then at that point, it's just a Mac keyboard and not a, you know, Windows keyboard with weird keys that you have to pretend are different keys or whatever.
[02:39:10.200 --> 02:39:13.200]  That was a nice feature of it. And so that's what I'm using now.
[02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:39.200]  My weakness on the keyboard front is is on the wireless front is I'm I'm more likely to buy a bunch of and in fact, have recently bought a bunch of Bluetooth keyboards before settling on Apple's magic keyboard, which I can't believe I didn't try first because I had the old magic keyboard, the one that took batteries, and I didn't realize how much better the new one is that charges by lightning.
[02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:56.200]  Oh, so you had that you had the the whatever it was called wasn't the magic keyboard. It was like the, what was it? I think it was called a magic keyboard. But I don't I don't think so. I think it was just the Bluetooth keyboard. And that's the one with the with the double A batteries. Yeah, in that little cylinder on the back a cylinder that honestly looked like it was meant to hold double A batteries.
[02:39:56.200 --> 02:40:10.200]  That's Yeah, exactly right. And then the magic keyboard has just the lightning charger. And no, it's really good. And you can get studio neat makes a thing. And then there's another one that the studio needs is called the canopy and it is lovely.
[02:40:10.200 --> 02:40:23.200]  And Federico found one that's very much like the old origami workstation thing, which has got like a magnetic fold and all that. And the idea there is with either of those, you've got a little keyboard holder that is also a stand for an iPad.
[02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:41.200]  Yes, exactly. I have to look up Federico's on the on the actual plugin mechanical keyboard front. I'm so loyal to the Apple keyboard to that I'm a little less likely to do what I'm always tempted to do after you're on the show and just buy what you're said you're using.
[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:56.200]  Although I did buy your Mattias. But that's a wireless one. I did buy the Mattias one. Yeah, well, Mattias is the one that's supposed to be the most like the old switches on the Yeah, I don't agree with extended. Yeah, I don't agree with it.
[02:40:56.200 --> 02:41:11.200]  Yeah, I don't like them as much as I like the Cherry Brown switches because I got one of those testers that you and I discovered a couple couple times ago when I was on. But yeah, I have used the Mattias with my iPad a lot like in the kitchen.
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:23.200]  Although now with the iPad, the new iPad Pro, I've been taking it can power more external USB keyboards than the old one could. The old one was kind of touchy, but now the it can power most of these keyboards that I've got.
[02:41:23.200 --> 02:41:36.200]  So I've been sort of like just dragging out other mechanical keyboards and using them to is the keyboard. Are there options for colors or is the one that you show me like that's the that is it because it's a very it's colorful in the corners.
[02:41:36.200 --> 02:41:49.200]  It's almost like Lego like a Lego like primary palette. So it comes with all just shades of gray and then it's got highlight key colored versions that also come with it that you can put on.
[02:41:49.200 --> 02:42:00.200]  So by default, you can have it be just completely. It's like a light gray and a dark gray, and that's it. And it's standard key caps. You could replace them with other key caps if you wanted to. But so I've got the I actually put my key.
[02:42:00.200 --> 02:42:09.200]  My keys are yellow. My my arrow keys. Yeah, that's what I see in the image you sent me. This is a problem for me because there's I have a couple of pet peeves with keyboards.
[02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:23.200]  I need our keys have to have them. I have to have Mac command keys or blank or something, but I can't have a Windows key. I just it offends me, and I don't want it.
[02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:37.200]  Oh, yeah, it's the worst. So I want the Mac style, you know, and it could be, you know, in theory, it could say, like, control instead of, you know, or have the symbols instead of the names.
[02:42:37.200 --> 02:42:49.200]  You know, I was impressed that the Vortex race actually has the Mac keys in the box. So you just lift off the windows and whatever the alt key has, and you put on the option and the command.
[02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:55.200]  And so I like that because most of them do not do that. They just don't care about ticks all of the boxes.
[02:42:55.200 --> 02:43:07.200]  All right, here's another one. Another one for me. Really personal. I cannot cannot buy a keyboard that has aerial as the typeface for the key caps.
[02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:16.200]  And this one uses Helvetica. Damn it, Jason. It looks good, too. It's got the they're they're big in the center of the keys, which is kind of old school typewriter a little bit.
[02:43:16.200 --> 02:43:26.200]  And I like that about it. You know, it's not these aren't for everybody. I don't know. Did you ever figure out what kind of Cherry switches style you liked the best?
[02:43:26.200 --> 02:43:30.200]  No, but I think Cherry Brown. I think I'm with the Brown, too.
[02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:36.200]  That's the one that that has worked for me. I don't know. I don't want to I don't want to cost you 130 bucks, but I do I do like it.
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:43.200]  I got to tell you, I know we've been running forever, but it's a short show. Let's I got I got one one story to tell you.
[02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:47.200]  I reviewed this Bluetooth mechanical keyboard that they read all the articles.
[02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:52.200]  I wrote about this stuff and they're like, oh, you got to try this out. It's Bluetooth. It'll work on the Mac. It's got backlighting. It's all this stuff.
[02:43:52.200 --> 02:43:58.200]  And it's this crazy keyboard. It'll like it has backlighting effects where you touch a key and like lights ripple out from the key.
[02:43:58.200 --> 02:44:08.200]  It's very it's not good, but it's amazing. And I had this moment where I realized I had a an inviolable keyboard rule that I didn't know I had,
[02:44:08.200 --> 02:44:16.200]  which is they have a the shift key is on the far side of the arrow keys on the right side.
[02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:21.200]  So if you want to press shift, you have to go past the up arrow. Oh, that's that would not work.
[02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:25.200]  I started I started typing and I was like, oh, no, I can't use this keyboard. And I put it away.
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:30.200]  It's like I can't I can't even do it. So there's weird keyboard layouts do not work for me.
[02:44:30.200 --> 02:44:38.200]  I actually bought for this vortex. I just bought these things that are they're like they're almost like covers for key switches.
[02:44:38.200 --> 02:44:44.200]  And they basically block off a key switch. I think they're called what are they called switch blockers?
[02:44:44.200 --> 02:44:53.200]  Because the only problem I have my real complaint with the vortex three is that I don't it's like on new Apple laptops.
[02:44:53.200 --> 02:45:00.200]  I have a hard time orienting my hands without looking. Yes, because it's just a grid of keys.
[02:45:00.200 --> 02:45:06.200]  And so the right above the right arrow key on this keyboard is a lot of keys that I never really use.
[02:45:06.200 --> 02:45:11.200]  You know, home and page up, page down. And I realize what I'm going to do now that I found these things,
[02:45:11.200 --> 02:45:17.200]  these switch blockers is I'm going to take a couple of those keys off and block them.
[02:45:17.200 --> 02:45:23.200]  At which point I have a blank space in the keyboard that my fingers can feel and orient properly.
[02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:27.200]  So that that I'm excited that I knew those must exist somewhere.
[02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:30.200]  And I finally found them. So I'm going to give that a try and see if that solves.
[02:45:30.200 --> 02:45:37.200]  That's the only complaint is that every now and then I find myself having shifted over a key and everything comes out nonsense.
[02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:42.200]  And then I'm curse and move and then I get back to it. And I want to I want to stop that.
[02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:50.200]  What does the PPN key do? That's well, so this is a programmable keyboard, so you hold down PN and you can do stuff.
[02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:53.200]  That's how you switch between the Mac mode and the windows mode.
[02:45:53.200 --> 02:46:06.200]  And for people who are programmers, I think my understanding is you basically can program multiple keys keystrokes into a single key using the programming system for the keyboard.
[02:46:06.200 --> 02:46:14.200]  But all I did was do what I looked in the manual and press the button that makes it a Mac keyboard. And then I'm going to lock that key out, too.
[02:46:14.200 --> 02:46:19.200]  Quite frankly, because I don't need to press that and accidentally send my keyboard into some weird key layer thing.
[02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:29.200]  But apparently that's a for for some people, that's a real big thing is the programmable keyboards where you've got to fire off a whole bunch of keystrokes in a sequence and you can actually just program them in.
[02:46:29.200 --> 02:46:36.200]  And then you press one key and it's like a macro. It's like keyboard maestro in in hardware hardware. Gotcha.
[02:46:36.200 --> 02:46:42.200]  But I don't I don't need that because I got keyboard maestro. Exactly. I was going to say that you beat me to the punch.
[02:46:42.200 --> 02:46:51.200]  One thing I don't like about the mechanical keyboard world and I like about this one is that this one, it's like you pick you got you pick your switches and it gives you the keys and you just get a box with everything in it.
[02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:56.200]  And then if you want to pop some keys off and put other ones on, they're all there already and you're done.
[02:46:56.200 --> 02:47:04.200]  There's there's a lot too many of these that are shipping is like kits that you have to kind of do the assembly on more than just popping keyboards on that.
[02:47:04.200 --> 02:47:11.200]  It's it's it's like there's a whole keyboard kit culture, which is great if you're into that sort of thing.
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:16.200]  But if you're somebody who just wants a neat keyboard like this is a cool keyboard, I want this.
[02:47:16.200 --> 02:47:20.200]  It's like I don't want to solder anything. I don't want to build my own keys.
[02:47:20.200 --> 02:47:25.200]  I don't want to have to choose a particular layout. I just kind of want to get the keyboard and use it.
[02:47:25.200 --> 02:47:37.200]  Yeah, because, you know, I've been I don't want to spoil any Christmas, but somebody in the household has been very serious about asking for a gaming PC for a long time.
[02:47:37.200 --> 02:47:42.200]  It's been determined that that they should get it. And I don't know shit about buying the gaming PC.
[02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:50.200]  And I heard people and I brought this up a few episodes ago and people wrote and said, you should build them together, that this is, you know, father son bonding experience.
[02:47:50.200 --> 02:47:57.200]  And I know your colleague and everybody's mutual friend on the Internet, Mike Hurley, has gone through this.
[02:47:57.200 --> 02:48:05.200]  He did this. Yeah. I think the bonding is really that Jonas will hear swear words out of your mouth.
[02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:11.200]  I hear that he's never heard before. Well, I but I don't know anything about gaming PCs.
[02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:19.200]  I didn't. Now I do because me and John Syracuse got me started and I figured it out.
[02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:33.200]  But the thing I figured out with an enormous amount of research, like when I started, like, ball parking, what my time is worth and what I thought I was spending on this PC and how much time I put into it.
[02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:39.200]  I was like, oh, Christ, I did. I mean, we're almost break even. And I didn't buy the damn thing yet.
[02:48:39.200 --> 02:48:44.200]  I mean, like you should have just paid somebody who was good to have a pre-built one.
[02:48:44.200 --> 02:48:49.200]  This is what we did. Well, what I figured out and maybe I'm wrong because I'm not in this world.
[02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:56.200]  But what I figured out is that they are they're all build build your own PCs.
[02:48:56.200 --> 02:49:04.200]  It's just a question of whether you're the one screwing it all together or whether you somebody else you order it and then they mail it to you already put together.
[02:49:04.200 --> 02:49:15.200]  Like, you know, and, you know, a lot of this stuff you can figure out. I just didn't know which like what is a good Nvidia graphics card for 2018.
[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:25.200]  You know, but you just pick you pick a CPU, you pick a GPU, you pick a motherboard, you pick what type of RAM and then you have some kind of case and a cooling system.
[02:49:25.200 --> 02:49:35.200]  And, you know, it's all stuff, you know, you know what RAM is and you know what the difference in eight and 16 gigs of RAM and certainly know what SSD is, you know.
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:43.200]  But when you buy a pre-built one from like a reputable company, it's all you're making all the exact same decisions and the part names are exactly the same.
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:50.200]  They just come all together. And I'm hoping are guaranteed to work all together.
[02:49:50.200 --> 02:50:05.200]  So I'm not putting you down if you enjoy doing it yourself and maybe you can save some money. But, you know, and I read some reviews and the reviewers, you know, like a PC mags are clearly now would emphasize, you know, that, OK, this is billed as expensive.
[02:50:05.200 --> 02:50:10.200]  But it's if you look at the components, it's actually not much of it's because the components are expensive.
[02:50:10.200 --> 02:50:15.200]  You know, this one, you know, you buy this thing from this company and sure, that's expensive.
[02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:23.200]  But it's, you know, priced out the individual components. And it's actually, you know, you're getting, you know, you're getting a lot of work, assembly work for a very low price.
[02:50:23.200 --> 02:50:30.200]  So that's the route I went. But the thing the other thing that really cracked me up really, really cracked me up.
[02:50:30.200 --> 02:50:38.200]  And it just shows I am I am further drifted into the Apple world over the decades.
[02:50:38.200 --> 02:50:47.200]  What these people consider expensive is not expensive. It is like, oh, my God, that's not what I kept reading these things.
[02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:55.200]  And they'd say like such and such is expensive. And then I'd look at the prices for it. And it would be like that, you know, like SSD, you know, and they'd be like, well, it's pricey.
[02:50:55.200 --> 02:51:03.200]  And it's like, well, that's a lot less than I'm used to paying for, like a 256 to 512 upgrade on the SSD.
[02:51:03.200 --> 02:51:10.200]  Oh, yeah. So like the advantage of being ingrained in the Apple ecosystem is you step over to the other side.
[02:51:10.200 --> 02:51:18.200]  And it's it's like, you know, like you're going to some country where the dollar, you know, a hundred dollars can get you into a five star hotel.
[02:51:18.200 --> 02:51:24.200]  It's like this is not expensive. But the other crazy thing about the PC world, I don't know if you knew this.
[02:51:24.200 --> 02:51:30.200]  I'm sure everybody is listening to this show is going to think I'm ridiculously out of touch for not really being in tune to this.
[02:51:30.200 --> 02:51:36.200]  But in the gaming PC world, everything has led lights, everything, right?
[02:51:36.200 --> 02:51:40.200]  You're my your mouse has lights. Your keyboard has lights.
[02:51:40.200 --> 02:51:46.200]  It's like a keyboard that I that I tried, which I think that's why it has those lights, is because it comes from the from gaming background.
[02:51:46.200 --> 02:51:52.200]  And it's like you can have them do random patterns that have nothing to do with anything.
[02:51:52.200 --> 02:51:59.200]  You can have them like like eight different programmable ways that your keys can dance in front of you as you type.
[02:51:59.200 --> 02:52:09.200]  I'm I'm not making this up, Jason. The displays have lights like not the display, but like the back of the display has lights that can shine onto the wall.
[02:52:09.200 --> 02:52:17.200]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, totally. So it's like that Phillips thing, you know, like Phillips had a thing for the TVs where they could shine a light on the wall.
[02:52:17.200 --> 02:52:23.200]  I find like the dominant color of the what was on the TV and broadcast that onto your wall. So it was more immersive.
[02:52:23.200 --> 02:52:29.200]  Right. And I'm laughing. And, you know, here I am of someone who enjoys vacationing in Las Vegas.
[02:52:29.200 --> 02:52:36.200]  But, you know, so I'm not immune to the charms of brightly colored, flashy lights.
[02:52:36.200 --> 02:52:42.200]  But it just seems like the craziest thing in the world that it's it is absolutely 100 percent.
[02:52:42.200 --> 02:52:48.200]  It's just assumed that your gaming PC will have a ridiculous sort of Vegas.
[02:52:48.200 --> 02:52:56.200]  Strip sky. You know, it's going to look like the sign to a motel two blocks off the Vegas Strip.
[02:52:56.200 --> 02:53:01.200]  Yeah, right. Including the words, the keyboard thing kills me.
[02:53:01.200 --> 02:53:08.200]  How could you look at that? And of course, you can always turn it off, I guess. But it seems crazy.
[02:53:08.200 --> 02:53:14.200]  Yep. So you've avoided the whole gaming PC thing.
[02:53:14.200 --> 02:53:20.200]  I have. And my son, my son is a game is a gamer and would, I think, would love one.
[02:53:20.200 --> 02:53:24.200]  And I think even he knows that it's maybe a bridge too far. I've offered to let him.
[02:53:24.200 --> 02:53:29.200]  I have boot camp on my iMac Pro, which is a pretty good, you know, graphics wise, pretty good.
[02:53:29.200 --> 02:53:37.200]  He could just come out here and play PC games. I think the fact is that he is mostly satisfied at this point with console games and iPad games.
[02:53:37.200 --> 02:53:43.200]  But I have I have thought about it. It's actually one of the things that frustrates me about the Apple's current lineup is I kind of want to buy him a new Mac
[02:53:43.200 --> 02:53:52.200]  because he's got a very old MacBook Air. But I want to get him one that's got decent enough power and graphics that I could put boot camp on it and let him play PC games on that.
[02:53:52.200 --> 02:53:59.200]  And right now, that would be like the MacBook escape, I guess, which is old and need hasn't been updated.
[02:53:59.200 --> 02:54:06.200]  So I'm just sort of sitting it out because that's what I thought I might do is get him a Mac that could play PC games, too.
[02:54:06.200 --> 02:54:13.200]  It's especially a tough sell if you're going to be taxing it right. Like the the year and a half old MacBook escape is a really tough sell.
[02:54:13.200 --> 02:54:20.200]  It might be perfect for some people right now, but for somebody who's going to be taxing the graphics of it, it's it's a really hard sell.
[02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:30.200]  Exactly. Exactly. So I do I do fear that moment where it comes to me and says it's time for me to get a gaming PC because I really would rather not go through that.
[02:54:30.200 --> 02:54:33.200]  But it might happen.
[02:54:33.200 --> 02:54:40.200]  It's it's an eye opener. Anything else you want to talk about?
[02:54:40.200 --> 02:54:48.200]  Oh, I think I think we've done all that two human beings could do in three hours and seven minutes.
[02:54:48.200 --> 02:54:52.200]  It does seem like graphics cards, but it does seem like the connector story has straightened out on the PC side.
[02:54:52.200 --> 02:55:04.200]  It seems like everything is DisplayPort and that's good. And USB, you know. But we'll see how this goes.
[02:55:04.200 --> 02:55:09.200]  I'm surprised, John. I mean, having a PC in your house is a big step just on its own.
[02:55:09.200 --> 02:55:14.200]  Like John, you mentioned John Syracuse. So like you won't have an Xbox in his house because it's like it's Microsoft.
[02:55:14.200 --> 02:55:21.200]  He's not going to allow it. Yeah. See, I don't have that. I don't have any kind of religious aversion to having a PC in my house.
[02:55:21.200 --> 02:55:25.200]  I like I've never been that type of you know, I used to have an Xbox.
[02:55:25.200 --> 02:55:30.200]  It never bothered me because it wasn't you know, it had nothing to do with why I used a Mac.
[02:55:30.200 --> 02:55:37.200]  We have an Xbox. It's fine. Yeah, I always liked it. I actually liked it a lot.
[02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:42.200]  That's not the issue to me. It's I don't know what to do.
[02:55:42.200 --> 02:55:47.200]  Like I'm not it's you know, I have no idea how Windows 10 works.
[02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:51.200]  I don't know. I mean, is it going to be self-explanatory? I don't know.
[02:55:51.200 --> 02:55:54.200]  My son doesn't use it either. And he seems to know he'll just pick it up.
[02:55:54.200 --> 02:55:59.200]  And I'm hoping you will because but I don't know.
[02:55:59.200 --> 02:56:04.200]  It confuses the heck out of me because I learned how to use how I can get around an XP.
[02:56:04.200 --> 02:56:08.200]  But it doesn't help. Doesn't help anymore with now because my boot camp now is Windows 10.
[02:56:08.200 --> 02:56:11.200]  It's like I have no idea what's going on there. Yeah, I haven't had boot camp.
[02:56:11.200 --> 02:56:15.200]  I've never even installed boot camp. I haven't added Windows installed on.
[02:56:15.200 --> 02:56:21.200]  I think the last time I ran Windows on a Mac was a virtual PC.
[02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:26.200]  I wasn't even like parallel. It was like back at a power PC era.
[02:56:26.200 --> 02:56:32.200]  Yeah, I think it was in the power PC era when and it was so slow because it's off Windows or virtual PC.
[02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:34.200]  Yeah, I think I was a virtual PC fan for some reason.
[02:56:34.200 --> 02:56:42.200]  And it was important for me to just for testing and in PC browsers because I was doing web development work.
[02:56:42.200 --> 02:56:47.200]  And, you know, however slow it was, if it rendered correctly, you could just assume it would be fast enough.
[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:51.200]  And somebody else would do final testing to make sure it wasn't actually slow, you know,
[02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:54.200]  but rendering issues were just the whole thing and I could use it for that.
[02:56:54.200 --> 02:56:58.200]  But that I mean, we're talking like 1997 or something like that.
[02:56:58.200 --> 02:57:00.200]  Yeah, PCs have advanced since then.
[02:57:00.200 --> 02:57:06.200]  Yeah, I'm sure they have. But it's I'm not so sure they've advanced in that they've that Windows has gotten better.
[02:57:06.200 --> 02:57:13.200]  It's just I'm just lost. I don't know. But it's quite a quite an eye opener buying these things.
[02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:17.200]  And I do see, you know, conversely, I see the I didn't doubt it.
[02:57:17.200 --> 02:57:22.200]  But I do see the problem some people have with perceiving Apple's equivalence as being expensive.
[02:57:22.200 --> 02:57:25.200]  Although I will say this. Here's another thing now.
[02:57:25.200 --> 02:57:34.200]  So most of the stuff like going from 256 gigs of SSD storage to 512, you you pay Apple more than you pay most of these companies, you know,
[02:57:34.200 --> 02:57:40.200]  and you can buy components. There are, of course, you know, people who want to build out a seven thousand dollar gaming PC or more, I'm sure.
[02:57:40.200 --> 02:57:50.200]  And you can buy, you know, the world, you know, there's all sorts of ways that you can certainly put yourself well up into the stratosphere of Apple pricing, you know, on the PC side.
[02:57:50.200 --> 02:58:06.200]  But there is as far as I can see, there is no equivalent of the Apple's 5K retina iMac display for a PC for the prices that, you know, that you assume the display is worth in the iMac.
[02:58:06.200 --> 02:58:20.200]  Like fork and, you know, and gaming stresses it in different ways. And, you know, what makes the iMac 5K monitor great for the stuff that Mac users use it for, it may not be suitable for gaming at all.
[02:58:20.200 --> 02:58:28.200]  You know, but like 4K gaming is a real stretch right now, as far as I can see within relatively reasonable budgets.
[02:58:28.200 --> 02:58:38.200]  And there's very few displays out there. Whereas I've had a 5K display on my desk at a reasonable price for I don't know how many years now. Right.
[02:58:38.200 --> 02:58:47.200]  I don't know. So that's one area where Apple is still, you know, you know, when they pick and choose their places, they're they're incredibly advanced and capable.
[02:58:47.200 --> 02:59:00.200]  And remember that all that crazy stuff they did where they had like tool to the way they got the 5K iMac to work is it really had like two Thunderbolt things, speaking and doing half the screen and they just made it so you couldn't tell.
[02:59:00.200 --> 02:59:09.200]  Anyway, it's a bad world out there. I don't count yourself lucky. Anyway, Jason Snell, thank you so much for coming back.
[02:59:09.200 --> 02:59:18.200]  Always a pleasure. Have a good holiday season. Everybody can read your work to find all of your work at six colors dot com.
[02:59:18.200 --> 02:59:23.200]  I always like to know you can spell colors, however you feel it should be spelled.
[02:59:23.200 --> 02:59:30.200]  On Twitter at J Snell and for your podcast listening enjoyment.
[02:59:30.200 --> 02:59:36.200]  Jason has about 30 different podcasts, including.
[02:59:36.200 --> 02:59:43.200]  Oh, I should definitely mention the the episode of the incomparable that we did where we talked about 2001 A Space Odyssey.
[02:59:43.200 --> 02:59:49.200]  I linked to it a few weeks ago. But and other people who have been mentioned on this show were there as well.
[02:59:49.200 --> 02:59:56.200]  John Siracusa, Dr. Drang, who is delightful and probably needs to have a podcast.
[02:59:56.200 --> 03:00:01.200]  But I thought that came out so well. I don't know. I was really worried because it's a very difficult film to talk about.
[03:00:01.200 --> 03:00:06.200]  And I thought that was really interesting. Yeah, I was glad you could be on.
[03:00:06.200 --> 03:00:14.200]  And it was fun to talk about. That's one of those movies that you could I mean, you could literally talk about it for days and not scratch the surface of it.
[03:00:14.200 --> 03:00:20.200]  But I felt like within the context of a 90 minute, two hour or whatever podcast, we covered a lot of the highlights.
[03:00:20.200 --> 03:00:26.200]  And it was fun to have that conversation. So thanks for being on. What other podcasts?
[03:00:26.200 --> 03:00:33.200]  The one maybe of most interest to talk show listeners is upgrade that I do with Mike Hurley every every Monday.
[03:00:33.200 --> 03:00:39.200]  And I do with some other stuff over at relay. So relay FM for that and the incomparable dot com for the incomparable stuff.
[03:00:39.200 --> 03:00:45.200]  And I post most of those highlights at six colors anyway. Yes, it's got six colors and you'll find you'll find it all.
[03:00:45.200 --> 03:01:01.200]  Anyway, have a great holiday season. Best to you and the family. Thanks. Likewise.
