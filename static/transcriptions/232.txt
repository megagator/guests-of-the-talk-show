[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  I guess I should just say I don't think I've told anybody but a few weeks ago or months ago,
[00:04.000 --> 00:09.360]  I guess at this point, I did a q&a episode of this show, where it was just me answering listener
[00:09.360 --> 00:17.760]  questions. And it turned out my my recording was corrupted. Due to a USB problem, I didn't know it,
[00:17.760 --> 00:21.360]  I couldn't hear it. And so I had to redo that whole episode. So there's actually two versions
[00:21.360 --> 00:29.120]  of that episode. And as I was just telling, just telling molds, I think I did better because I'd
[00:29.120 --> 00:35.840]  never I had never done an episode without a guest before. I think I was a little awkward. And I
[00:35.840 --> 00:39.920]  think doing it twice in a row, I guess I did it the next day. I forget if I did it. I think I
[00:39.920 --> 00:45.120]  did it the next day. But it was better because it was like it was like I'd worked out the kinks
[00:45.120 --> 00:51.680]  of that a little bit. I will say this, though. And this is my question to you. So I think recording
[00:51.680 --> 00:57.920]  that thing twice was good for me. I've had times it's been it's been a long time since I've lost
[00:57.920 --> 01:05.920]  data on a computer, you know, like, app crashed and, or some kind of mix up or you over, you know,
[01:05.920 --> 01:11.200]  bad RM command on a terminal, and you just deleted it, you just jinxed us. But every time I've ever
[01:11.200 --> 01:19.120]  in my life lost, like an article or a school paper, anything. I have never once felt like
[01:19.120 --> 01:23.760]  I did a better job recreating it. I've always felt like, oh, my God, there was something I had.
[01:23.760 --> 01:30.880]  I had it going on when I wrote that. And I'm not getting it right. And the never shake the nagging
[01:30.880 --> 01:37.360]  sense that wasn't there a great point I made? I'm not I don't have it. Like, yeah. I think maybe
[01:37.360 --> 01:41.840]  it's different with writing than with talking. But yeah, that's it. That's exactly my point is that
[01:41.840 --> 01:46.400]  yeah, there is something different about it. Like I could recreate a podcast, but I don't I could
[01:46.400 --> 01:51.360]  never I feel like I can never recreate an article. Yeah, I think I think that's that's definitely
[01:51.360 --> 01:58.480]  true. I one time lost the audio. The audio was just I think it was badly corrupted for some
[01:58.480 --> 02:04.720]  reason when I was recording an episode of The Rebound. And so now I now I record with two
[02:05.840 --> 02:10.080]  two different computers at the same time. So I'm recording with two to Max right now,
[02:10.080 --> 02:14.720]  which is my usual my usual set up. And if something goes wrong, if something eventually
[02:14.720 --> 02:20.880]  goes wrong with both of them, I'll get a third. Just like I'm just going to keep adding Max
[02:20.880 --> 02:30.400]  until until I no longer have any problems. I have enough lying around. I might as well use them.
[02:32.000 --> 02:41.200]  So I've got my I've got my 2016 MacBook Pro and a 2009 unibody white MacBook. Hmm.
[02:42.640 --> 02:45.680]  So how do you like the MacBook Pro? Which one do you have? You probably have the two
[02:45.680 --> 02:50.320]  of the original one, the original one. I so I don't have I have not had the only problem I've
[02:50.320 --> 02:56.160]  had with the keyboard so far is that the well, other than it being that keyboard and the typing
[02:56.160 --> 03:02.720]  on it is not necessarily my favorite experience. But I haven't had any problems with keys not
[03:02.720 --> 03:08.640]  functioning really, other than the right shift key is slightly squishy. And this is, you know,
[03:08.640 --> 03:14.000]  that's two years, basically almost two years into using it. So I don't think that's so bad.
[03:14.000 --> 03:19.600]  I have to send it back. I mean, it's like, I'm pretty sure I'm overdue. I still have the 15
[03:19.600 --> 03:25.200]  inch MacBook Pro from the summer. And I don't know, at some point, I stopped using it, you know,
[03:25.200 --> 03:29.600]  I use it for a solid month, maybe like six weeks. And it was because it was summer and we were
[03:29.600 --> 03:34.720]  traveling to it was actually kind of natural. Like I literally I wasn't even using my iMac at home,
[03:34.720 --> 03:40.320]  I was just using that 15 inch MacBook Pro for everything, all my writing, all the email.
[03:41.840 --> 03:45.920]  And I said, I think it was on the podcast, even. I don't think I wrote about it. Maybe I did. Or
[03:45.920 --> 03:50.480]  maybe I tweeted it. It wasn't on daring fireball. But at some point, like two weeks in, I mentioned
[03:50.480 --> 03:56.240]  that like the S key or the E key, maybe it was D was E, S or D, it was something on my left hand
[03:56.240 --> 04:05.760]  got stuck twice. But easily was unstuck just by pressing the key again. And I don't know, I was
[04:05.760 --> 04:09.920]  just a tweet. It's like, I have to be so careful. But then somebody from Apple PR reached out to me,
[04:09.920 --> 04:13.760]  and they're like, Oh, we send you another one. And and it was funny, because I think it was
[04:13.760 --> 04:18.640]  somebody who was on vacation when I did it because it was like two weeks later. And and I was like,
[04:18.640 --> 04:23.280]  you know what, it's been two weeks and I haven't had a problem since not a single single problem.
[04:23.840 --> 04:27.520]  And then I used it for weeks full time and never once had another problem again.
[04:28.080 --> 04:32.480]  So there was something I almost feel like it was a different problem. It wasn't like a reliability
[04:32.480 --> 04:37.280]  problem was almost like maybe like when the keyboard was new. It was just a little more
[04:37.280 --> 04:43.360]  prone to that. I mean, it's like, I reliability problems aside, because the reliability thing is
[04:43.360 --> 04:50.880]  a whole nother ballgame like when the keyboard actually fails. Like I actually do think I really
[04:50.880 --> 04:55.680]  wonder like, I don't like the low travel. I know some people love it, though. It's obviously
[04:55.680 --> 05:02.080]  subjective. But it's like the tolerance is so there's like no tolerance between the aluminum
[05:03.520 --> 05:08.480]  frame around the keyboard and the keys themselves. Like that's partly what makes it feel so nice and
[05:08.480 --> 05:15.280]  premium because they don't jiggle at all. You know. And but I feel like that's what maybe
[05:15.840 --> 05:20.560]  made it so it's possible. I almost feel like with my previous generation MacBook Pro, the one I'm
[05:20.560 --> 05:24.800]  staring at right now, you couldn't even get a key stuck, right? It's like there's no way to make a
[05:24.800 --> 05:30.320]  key get stuck. Because it's like a bit of there's a bit of a gap between the aluminum around the
[05:30.320 --> 05:35.360]  key. Yeah, I have a lot I have a lot because I have a kid and you know, a kid who was younger
[05:35.360 --> 05:43.200]  back then. I have a lot of MacBooks with keys that have been pulled off. Like this, this point one
[05:43.200 --> 05:50.080]  here is missing a missing a function, one of the function keys. And and the and for years, he used
[05:50.080 --> 05:56.880]  my old MacBook Pro, which was like a 2010, I think. And that's, that's missing a couple keys
[05:56.880 --> 06:00.560]  too. Or actually, no, I think I think it's just now I know what the problem with that one is,
[06:00.560 --> 06:06.400]  he spilled a drink on it. And the key most of the keys just simply don't work. So I have it upstairs
[06:06.400 --> 06:12.080]  with the keyboard plugged into it. I'm Jonas's MacBook Pro. I think I mentioned this on the show
[06:12.080 --> 06:17.760]  a while ago. Jonas's he needs a new MacBook or laptop. I don't I'm not even 100% sure that he'll
[06:17.760 --> 06:22.160]  get a MacBook, but I think he will. But you and I have talked about the gaming PC thing. Yeah.
[06:22.160 --> 06:27.360]  Like he doesn't want a gaming laptop. Like he wants a gaming PC desktop, which I think makes
[06:27.360 --> 06:33.280]  sense for his needs. You get more for your money. Yeah, it's, you know, and then who knows what,
[06:33.280 --> 06:37.360]  so, you know, we've been waiting for this event, we'll get to this, you know, but this event coming
[06:37.360 --> 06:41.760]  up next week, when supposedly, there's going to be new MacBooks, you know, it's like, he really
[06:41.760 --> 06:48.320]  needed a MacBook before school started in August, but it just, it was like, literally the worst time
[06:48.320 --> 06:55.360]  ever for this. So long, it's a little weird that they have if assuming that what we're going to
[06:55.360 --> 07:00.160]  talk about later, but if they're coming, that's odd that it's so far after it's, it's, it is
[07:01.680 --> 07:06.400]  no season, not what you want. Yeah, right. Presumably, it's, you know, when they're ready,
[07:06.400 --> 07:11.440]  they're ready when they're ready. Yeah. I forget that. But do you see there was an interview with
[07:11.440 --> 07:17.120]  Schiller? I think it was in gadget had got an interview with Schiller for the iPhone 10. R.
[07:17.120 --> 07:25.680]  Yeah. And it's, I've talked to Schiller enough times that I, you know, I know what he's like,
[07:25.680 --> 07:30.080]  and he's always on when he's talking to the press. I mean, you just cannot knock him off his game.
[07:30.080 --> 07:34.320]  But there was this one answer. And who knows if it was, you know, you never know in an article what
[07:34.320 --> 07:40.960]  is taken out of context, or, you know, just one brief sentence from a longer thing. But it was
[07:40.960 --> 07:46.560]  like, he was asked about why did the why did the 10 are shipped, you know, six weeks after the 10 s
[07:46.560 --> 07:53.440]  and he was like, that's when it was ready. Yeah. And I don't know if that was just a sentence in
[07:53.440 --> 07:58.480]  a longer nicer thing. But I almost think maybe it wasn't, you know, they're ready when they're ready.
[07:58.480 --> 08:02.080]  And that's, you know, there's nothing that can be done about it. But anyway,
[08:02.080 --> 08:06.240]  Jonas's story. I mean, do you think that that's really true, though? I mean, do you think that
[08:06.880 --> 08:12.560]  they couldn't have? Because to me, it seems like it's a pricing thing that they thought that if
[08:12.560 --> 08:18.800]  they shipped them all at the same time, that they would sell a metric crap ton of the 10 hours and
[08:18.800 --> 08:24.960]  not as many expensive ones. Yeah, that is actually a good point. And I also think that product
[08:24.960 --> 08:28.560]  marketing wise, it would have been difficult to ship them all at the same time, because then which
[08:28.560 --> 08:33.120]  one do you advertise? You know, I got right about this on during fireball that advertising wise,
[08:33.920 --> 08:37.840]  this year. So I mean, maybe it's, you know, it's a little bit six, one half dozen the other because
[08:37.840 --> 08:41.920]  they probably I would think they stage it out. They have to stage it out for to a certain degree.
[08:41.920 --> 08:48.000]  And so they do it deliberately that way. And so yeah, they really were only ready then. But the
[08:48.000 --> 08:53.600]  part of that was the plan. Well, I think my guess and I have absolutely no inside information on
[08:53.600 --> 08:58.560]  this. And that supply chain, that sort of stuff is like the among the holiest of holies in my
[08:58.560 --> 09:03.600]  experience at Apple, like, because the people who really know are like, you know, Jeff Williams is
[09:03.600 --> 09:10.880]  not blabbing. Oh, yeah, we could add that out a month ago, you know, Jeff Williams is not going to,
[09:10.880 --> 09:15.920]  you know, tell you, but I think it's a little bit of column A and a little bit of column B,
[09:15.920 --> 09:19.440]  where if everything had gone perfectly, I still think the iPhone XR would have shipped
[09:20.320 --> 09:25.760]  some number of weeks after the tennis, but I think maybe not as many weeks as it did.
[09:25.760 --> 09:30.160]  I think it would have been better to ship it a few weeks earlier than it did.
[09:32.640 --> 09:37.760]  But I could be wrong. But I, you know, I don't think it's a coincidence that marketing wise,
[09:37.760 --> 09:44.320]  is this year and last year just happened to work out in the way that made the most sense
[09:44.320 --> 09:51.520]  for all of the iPhones involved. Because last year, if the tennis or the original 10 had
[09:51.520 --> 09:57.200]  shipped exactly alongside the eight, the eight would have been completely overshadowed. Like,
[09:57.840 --> 10:03.200]  nobody would have wanted to review it. Or the reviews would have been like one line.
[10:03.200 --> 10:08.800]  You know, yeah. And how do you advertise it? You know, like this, this other one that looks so new
[10:08.800 --> 10:17.600]  and so much more exciting, right edge to edge round corners. Steel shiny, it's shiny. I mean,
[10:17.600 --> 10:25.600]  literally shiny. I, you know, it really would have put the eight in a tight spot to ship alongside
[10:25.600 --> 10:31.200]  the 10 or even worse, if the eight had been the one to ship afterwards. Yeah, that wouldn't have
[10:31.200 --> 10:36.240]  worked well at all. Whereas this year, you know, the one that shipped first is the one that
[10:36.240 --> 10:43.840]  literally looks exactly like last year's to the naked eye. Except for a second model that
[10:43.840 --> 10:49.440]  literally looks the same but is bigger. You know, and it looks so much the same that in the TV
[10:49.440 --> 10:55.520]  commercials, they're playing perspective tricks to make them look the same size and then move the
[10:55.520 --> 11:00.320]  hands so you can see Oh, the one is bigger, you know, but they look so much the same that at
[11:00.320 --> 11:05.760]  first they it looks like two of the same phone. And the one that I think people are more excited
[11:05.760 --> 11:11.440]  about because you know, it's got amazing colors and it costs 250 less, I think you can really
[11:11.440 --> 11:16.800]  make the case that it costs 350 less. And if you want the bigger one, if you want, you know,
[11:16.800 --> 11:22.000]  if you're thinking about the 10 R versus the 10 s max, I honestly think you could make the case
[11:22.000 --> 11:28.880]  that it's $450 less, which is exciting. If you can be very happy with your phone and save $450.
[11:28.880 --> 11:35.280]  That is really exciting. And so I don't think it's a coincidence that the one that is more exciting,
[11:35.280 --> 11:40.560]  if not better, but more exciting is the one that ship later is the one that ships. Yes,
[11:40.560 --> 11:43.200]  absolutely. But anyway, we're anxiously awaiting that.
[11:46.960 --> 11:53.440]  So I guess the rumor is that for max, are we going to do that now? Well,
[11:53.440 --> 12:00.560]  maybe we'll save that for later. I feel like let's go forward linking. Sure. Looking later. This
[12:00.560 --> 12:03.920]  week's news, of course, is the well, you know what, I have follow up, let me do the follow up
[12:03.920 --> 12:11.600]  first. Last week with Dan Fromer, I was talking about HomeKit. And I've got these shades from
[12:11.600 --> 12:18.320]  a company called Lutron all around the house. Pretty expensive, to be honest. But I really
[12:18.320 --> 12:24.000]  like them. They're there. You know, we've got lights that are hooked up to the HomeKit stuff.
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.360]  I don't find that anywhere near as useful. I don't mind using switches for lights.
[12:30.400 --> 12:35.040]  I love having the shades hooked up to voice commands. And I love using HomeKit for it. But
[12:35.040 --> 12:42.240]  I was talking last week about setting up scenes where I could say, I'd set up a scene called like
[12:42.240 --> 12:48.800]  open the kitchen shades. And then I could talk to my various Siri enabled devices and say something
[12:48.800 --> 12:55.360]  like open the kitchen shades, and then that she would open the kitchen shades. Turns out that's
[12:55.360 --> 13:01.120]  not the right way to do it or not the best way to do it and HomeKit like in HomeKit, you can define
[13:01.120 --> 13:07.120]  rooms and you can you can move devices between the rooms once you've set them up. So it's better to
[13:07.120 --> 13:12.960]  just put define a kitchen and put the shades in the kitchen. And then you can say the same thing,
[13:13.600 --> 13:18.480]  open the kitchen shades or open the shades in the kitchen or any formulation that you think would
[13:18.480 --> 13:23.760]  work usually works. And then it just works. It works better. Like scenes are better for like,
[13:24.640 --> 13:30.560]  saying to set up one called like good morning that opens all the shades in the house or something
[13:30.560 --> 13:35.280]  like those throughout the house. Right, right. But if you really want to do it, like I do,
[13:35.280 --> 13:41.840]  like by room, it's surprise, surprise better to use the actual room feature in HomeKit,
[13:41.840 --> 13:47.520]  which I wasn't really even aware of. Like, I'd seen it. But I thought that that was just the
[13:47.520 --> 13:51.920]  way they were set up because that's what they were called in Lutron because we what the long story
[13:51.920 --> 13:58.080]  short, we had had these for like a year. But until recently, we could only use it with the Amazon
[13:58.080 --> 14:04.320]  thing because of some complicated something where our Lutron base station wasn't HomeKit compatible.
[14:04.320 --> 14:09.440]  And now we got one that is and anyway, so I wanted to clarify that a lot of people out there.
[14:10.320 --> 14:14.240]  But the funny thing too, about the follow up I got on this from HomeKit aficionados,
[14:14.240 --> 14:20.080]  is it all echoes what I'm what I'm thinking is that HomeKit is way underrated. Like it's it's
[14:20.080 --> 14:25.840]  like it got off to a slow start. And I the knock against it was that Apple had these stringent
[14:26.400 --> 14:32.880]  requirements, you know, for both security and both like compatibility. And the whole thing like
[14:32.880 --> 14:37.280]  hooking up to Amazon is sort of like loosey goosey, you know, you just make a thing and,
[14:37.280 --> 14:42.240]  you know, download an SDK. And, you know, you I don't think Amazon improves anything, you know,
[14:42.240 --> 14:47.200]  you just, it's just so much better. It's ridiculous and so much more customizable.
[14:48.800 --> 14:53.120]  I think the HomeKit app, the Home app could be better. But overall, I think it's really good.
[14:53.120 --> 14:59.760]  And it's a lot like the shortcut app for iOS 12. In terms of just sort of being,
[14:59.760 --> 15:05.280]  you're effectively programming these things, but doing it in a visual way that I think is
[15:05.280 --> 15:08.800]  approachable to regular people like you're not you don't need to use a programming language,
[15:08.800 --> 15:13.200]  but you're just dragging these things and moving icons around. And it, you know,
[15:13.200 --> 15:17.280]  ends up that you can, you know, effectively program these devices in your house. And I
[15:17.280 --> 15:22.160]  think it's pretty cool. So anyway, there's some follow up on that. Okay, you got these HomeKit
[15:22.160 --> 15:28.800]  stuff. I have nothing. We don't have an echo. We don't have any any of that stuff. And mostly,
[15:28.800 --> 15:33.840]  as some of the reason that we don't have the echo. So actually, my parents bought us one at
[15:33.840 --> 15:37.920]  one point, and they sent it back because they talked about with Karen. And we were just like,
[15:37.920 --> 15:44.080]  hmm, we don't really want microphones. And we had a, you know, like a security camera thing that
[15:45.600 --> 15:50.560]  we had gotten, it was a podcast, advertise, advertiser, send it for free to try out.
[15:50.560 --> 15:56.000]  And we had it hooked up for a long time. And then we took that out, too. And the reason I don't do
[15:56.000 --> 16:04.560]  the automation stuff is I'm just sure that Hank will screw. No, he's, he's just going to be doing
[16:04.560 --> 16:09.920]  it nonstop. Or he's gonna, you know, like screw with the scenario, you know, the scenes and
[16:09.920 --> 16:15.360]  whatever. So I'm just like, I'm not dealing with Jonas is so lazy. He doesn't do anything. He
[16:15.360 --> 16:19.920]  doesn't. He never tells. He never does. He's like the opposite. He just he doesn't even turn lights
[16:19.920 --> 16:25.520]  on. He'll just sit in the dark. Rather, like, not only does he not have to get up, but he's
[16:25.520 --> 16:28.800]  gonna have to get up. He could like literally just talk to his phone to turn lights on.
[16:29.440 --> 16:32.240]  And he won't even do that. He won't even bother to do it. Like
[16:36.000 --> 16:42.560]  it is funny to me how much how persistent Hank is at talking to Siri. And just how many times
[16:42.560 --> 16:47.360]  he will try, whether he's like in the car, and he's getting a bad connection. And so series not
[16:47.360 --> 16:54.160]  connecting to, you know, home base to process the question. Or if series not understanding what
[16:54.160 --> 17:00.640]  he's saying. He just he keeps trying and he keeps trying and he keeps trying and to the point where
[17:00.640 --> 17:07.680]  it's maddening. Just like, just type it in just open Wikipedia and type it in.
[17:09.120 --> 17:16.880]  Jonas had saved his money, by the way, and he pre ordered Red Dead Redemption two yesterday,
[17:16.880 --> 17:22.640]  which is looks pretty cool. I like westerns. I don't I'm so far out of the gaming scene.
[17:22.640 --> 17:28.000]  But it's supposed to be that's supposed to be the new hot. Yeah. Yeah. It's like Westworld
[17:28.000 --> 17:34.320]  and on your TV. It's only ps4, right? I guess. Yeah, I think so. We don't we don't have the ps4
[17:35.120 --> 17:40.720]  or ps4 only for now. I can't imagine that it will always be ps4 exclusive, but I wouldn't think so.
[17:40.720 --> 17:47.360]  I don't know how this stuff works. But anyway, it's also humongous. It is like,
[17:47.360 --> 17:54.320]  I think he told me it was 100 gigabytes or something. I don't know. But he's his ps4 is
[17:55.200 --> 18:01.840]  was obtained when the ps4 was very new for Christmas, like whatever the first Christmas
[18:01.840 --> 18:07.440]  was when ps4 was available, is when he got it. And so it's only got a 400 megabyte hard drive.
[18:07.440 --> 18:12.560]  So he's had to do an awful lot. And he's all in on digital download gigabyte, right?
[18:12.560 --> 18:23.280]  Yeah, he's got a floppy drive. He's got a one point. It's an HD floppy drive.
[18:23.280 --> 18:28.320]  So it used to be attached to my performer. Yeah. It's got a full 1.4 megabytes.
[18:32.080 --> 18:37.120]  So he's only got 400 gigabyte hard drive. And so he's had to end but he's all in on downloadable
[18:37.120 --> 18:41.520]  games, you know, other than like, I guess, I guess every time he gets discs is like from relatives
[18:41.520 --> 18:47.120]  at Christmas. But he's had to do a lot of, you know, like, delete the game, delete this, whatever.
[18:47.120 --> 18:51.840]  Yeah. But you can even if you buy the disc, I mean, there's always downloadable content. That's
[18:51.840 --> 18:58.080]  the thing because Hank just got Destiny two. And you know, it's like, Oh, good. You know, you go
[18:58.080 --> 19:02.880]  home and play this and he gets home. Like, Nope, gotta spend two hours downloading some of their
[19:02.880 --> 19:07.040]  software updates to it's like, effectively, the whole game has to be re downloaded. Somebody just
[19:07.040 --> 19:10.880]  tweeted a screenshot last I forget who it was. But it was after midnight, you know, so the Red Dead
[19:10.880 --> 19:16.640]  Redemption two at the you know, it's like New Year's Eve for people who like video games, you
[19:16.640 --> 19:20.720]  know, and they're all and the guy had the disc I guess he got the disc during the day and he tweeted
[19:20.720 --> 19:27.680]  a screenshot he was down. He had to download like 17 gigabytes before he could play. Like, I don't
[19:27.680 --> 19:33.520]  see the point of it. But anyway, I finally helped him out. And see, this is the thing I worry about
[19:33.520 --> 19:40.640]  the kid like, why didn't he come to me to ask for an external drive for his ps4. And I'm so
[19:40.640 --> 19:46.960]  out of touch. When the ps4 originally came out, you could not use external storage for games,
[19:46.960 --> 19:52.240]  you could like hook one up. And I forget what it would be for. But you couldn't do it to like play
[19:52.240 --> 19:56.320]  games. And at some point, Sony got their act together and issued a software update where yeah,
[19:56.320 --> 20:03.200]  you can just plug in a USB three drive and format it in the PlayStation and then you can just you
[20:03.200 --> 20:10.240]  know, you can download games to it. So yesterday, I he was like preparing to like erase this entire
[20:10.240 --> 20:13.840]  ps4 to make room for Red Dead Redemption two and I was like, look, let me help you out.
[20:14.960 --> 20:22.400]  And we hooked up a nice. I even I even got him a nice SSD hard drive. So it'd be nice and fast.
[20:22.400 --> 20:27.600]  I asked a friend of the show, Syracuse, if that was worthwhile. And long story,
[20:27.600 --> 20:30.240]  which I enjoyed. But long story short, yes, he said.
[20:30.240 --> 20:37.520]  I think I would have guessed that he would answer that. But yeah, it involves sequential reads.
[20:40.880 --> 20:45.280]  Yes, it would have done but I enjoyed the technical details. I did. But so now he has
[20:45.280 --> 20:50.560]  a nice SSD external drive. But anyway, I before he came home from school while I was coming down
[20:50.560 --> 20:56.480]  here to start the podcast. And I asked him if his game fully downloaded because that's a you know,
[20:56.480 --> 21:01.920]  that's a real heartbreak for a kid on a Friday. Yeah, like, it happened. It happened like six
[21:01.920 --> 21:06.800]  months ago, there was some game that Jonas had been long awaiting. And he thought he'd set it
[21:06.800 --> 21:11.760]  up to download while he was at school and got home and there was like an error message. Right. And
[21:11.760 --> 21:16.640]  when this is the error message, it was like that it started the download. I feel like the Xbox
[21:16.640 --> 21:21.040]  downloads just freeze from time to time. Yeah. Because I've seen Hank, you know, it would just
[21:21.040 --> 21:25.440]  stop it would not progress and then needed to back out and back into it again. And it wouldn't
[21:25.440 --> 21:30.400]  lose what it had downloaded already. But yeah, it was something like that. Yeah. If you just left it
[21:30.400 --> 21:34.800]  overnight and thought, Oh boy, it'll be ready when I get up in the morning. Nope. So anyway,
[21:34.800 --> 21:40.240]  I texted him before or I said hello to him, but then I forgot to ask. So I texted him while I'm
[21:40.240 --> 21:46.640]  down here recording with you. Did your game fully download? And he says, Oh, no punctuation. Oh,
[21:46.640 --> 21:55.760]  yeah. And I'm never leaving. So maybe I don't have to get him a new Mac book. Yeah, really.
[21:56.400 --> 22:02.960]  At least not now. How fast is he? But how fast is he gonna play through that? I don't know.
[22:03.680 --> 22:07.840]  If it's good, it'll take him a while. He gets his value out of them. You know, he yeah, you know,
[22:07.840 --> 22:13.840]  he tends to. Well, it depends on the game too. Because I mean, Hank has blown through some games.
[22:13.840 --> 22:18.160]  I'm trying to remember what because he did one recently, he got some game recently. And it was
[22:18.160 --> 22:22.880]  like, just a few days later, it's like, Yeah, I'm done. Yeah. Whoa, geez, really? Yeah, Jonas had
[22:22.880 --> 22:29.600]  one like that, too. I forget what it was. But like destiny, destiny is like, it, he's sort of fallen
[22:29.600 --> 22:33.600]  out of Fortnite. But for a while, I mean, in Fortnite, you don't even pay for which is
[22:33.600 --> 22:41.280]  ridiculous. So whatever he's, whatever he did spend on it to get costumes, dance move, or
[22:41.280 --> 22:47.920]  whatever they only bought. I mean, I know, I it's actually is what you buy dance moves and costumes.
[22:49.200 --> 22:53.920]  I have not seen that I have not seen that game. And Hank is not Hank has, I there's I think
[22:53.920 --> 22:58.400]  there's like a subculture that said that hates that game. Yeah, I did. Jonas has told me about
[22:58.400 --> 23:03.760]  it. Yeah. So he's into that group. Like, I got to like them when I drive that because we do a car
[23:03.760 --> 23:09.360]  pool for the kids back and forth from school. And so when I drive every once in a while here,
[23:09.360 --> 23:16.640]  and somebody muttered that it's overrated. Yeah. Yeah, I Jonas has filled me in on that. But anyway,
[23:16.640 --> 23:22.000]  but destiny, which does cost money, Jonas has gotten his money worth 1000 times over. I mean,
[23:22.000 --> 23:28.640]  yeah. Good God, he spent a lot of time. Yeah, Hank has spent a lot of time in that game, too.
[23:30.480 --> 23:33.840]  It seems fun. I mean, I played a little bit of it. Yeah, the only thing I can compare it to
[23:33.840 --> 23:40.800]  would be Bard's Tale. Remember Bard's Tale? I remember the name, but I know that man that I
[23:40.800 --> 23:46.160]  love Bard's Tale. It was like a Dungeons and Dragons type game. And it had like, it sort of
[23:46.160 --> 23:51.120]  had like a 3d interface, but it was like one square at a time. You know, like, think like
[23:51.120 --> 23:57.440]  Castle Wolfenstein 3d, but on an Apple two, you can only be in Yeah, yeah, you'd move it was like
[23:57.440 --> 24:02.880]  the D&D equivalent of moving like one square on graph paper at a time. Right. But you'd go,
[24:02.880 --> 24:07.200]  you know, you'd see the walls of a dungeon, you know, and you'd hit like up arrow to go ahead one.
[24:09.200 --> 24:16.720]  God, it was a really good game. There was like the most, for whatever reason,
[24:16.720 --> 24:21.760]  it's a weird number. But for whatever reason, the most of a bad guy you'd ever encounter was 99.
[24:21.760 --> 24:26.640]  It seems like a weird number because you'd think it would be like 256. Yeah, or something. Yeah,
[24:26.640 --> 24:31.920]  you'd think it'd be like 255 or 256 or something, but it was 99. It was limited by the actual
[24:31.920 --> 24:39.040]  digit. And Oh, yeah. Okay. So it was like more like a y2k problem. Right. And there was a room,
[24:39.040 --> 24:44.640]  there was a room you could go into. And it had there were these bad guys called berserkers.
[24:44.640 --> 24:50.640]  And they're kind of, I guess it's not funny. But they're berserkers were just
[24:52.560 --> 24:58.640]  crazy people with axes, you know, like, people who had just lost their minds and gone berserk and had
[24:58.640 --> 25:04.640]  like, were like a fit of rage. And there was a room where there were 99 berserkers 99 berserkers
[25:04.640 --> 25:10.800]  and 99 berserkers. It was I think three groups of 99 berserkers. And the first time you encounter
[25:10.800 --> 25:18.560]  this room. It's like you. I think I think you had like a party of six people. You could make a party
[25:18.560 --> 25:23.680]  of six people but like, so you were six but it was effectively you but you go in and it was sort of
[25:23.680 --> 25:28.960]  like Han Solo going into that room with all the stormtroopers except like the George the George
[25:28.960 --> 25:33.120]  Lucas version. The George Lucas version. Yeah. Where he adds a bunch of like 300 of them. Right.
[25:33.120 --> 25:37.680]  You first time because 11 is not cool. 300 school. Right. The first time you go in,
[25:37.680 --> 25:41.920]  do you just you're like, Oh my god, I have no chip. We're dead. Oh my god, where's the Oh my
[25:41.920 --> 25:45.520]  god, the last save point was all the way back that you're just it was like the most screwed you ever
[25:45.520 --> 25:52.080]  are. And then you got better at the game and your characters all got better. And it I'm sure it
[25:52.080 --> 25:55.600]  happened to everybody ever played the game. It dawned on you like, hey, a couple weeks ago,
[25:55.600 --> 26:00.160]  remember that room with all the berserkers? I could I have, there was two spells that were
[26:00.160 --> 26:07.760]  exactly the same lightning and a fireball. And they had they did the same amount of damage,
[26:07.760 --> 26:12.000]  but I had one, you know, by the time I recalled it, I was like, I had both of them. And it was
[26:12.000 --> 26:17.840]  the perfect weapon, you know, spell to do against like a group like that. So you could go back to
[26:17.840 --> 26:21.920]  that room. And then just instead of really fighting and fighting them, you just have your
[26:21.920 --> 26:28.560]  wizard shoot them with lightning bolt, and they'd all die. And you got massive, massive, like
[26:28.560 --> 26:34.160]  experience points and gold or whatever else. So and then you just back out of the dungeon. And
[26:34.160 --> 26:38.000]  once it was out of you know, the memory, it was sort of like, you know, like a scene loading,
[26:38.000 --> 26:42.800]  like you'd be outside, you'd find a place to go inside, it would like, then you'd load. So you
[26:42.800 --> 26:47.920]  just go back outside, go back in, and then they'd all be there again. And then it was like, you know,
[26:47.920 --> 26:52.000]  it was almost like a cheat code, like where you could, you know, like, remember in SimCity, you
[26:52.000 --> 26:55.760]  could type something and you just get like a million dollars, you just go into that room and
[26:55.760 --> 27:02.480]  killed killed 99% 297 berserkers over and over again. And then you could buy everything in the
[27:02.480 --> 27:09.280]  game. Anyway. Bard's Tale. That was a good game. Let me take a break. Thank our first sponsor. It's
[27:09.280 --> 27:15.040]  our good friends at Squarespace. These guys sponsor the show quite a bit, you may have
[27:15.040 --> 27:20.400]  noticed. They keep sponsoring, I was just talking to them recently, they keep sponsoring because
[27:20.400 --> 27:25.440]  people keep signing up for Squarespace through the show, which is great. It's absolutely fantastic.
[27:26.800 --> 27:32.640]  And I think it is also the sort of thing that like, you don't just go and decide that because
[27:32.640 --> 27:37.200]  I'm telling you about Squarespace to go make a website, you know, you make a website when you
[27:37.200 --> 27:42.000]  have a need to make a website, which might be soon, or it might be a couple months from now,
[27:42.640 --> 27:49.680]  or whenever. But with me reminding you, every once in a while that when you do need a new website,
[27:49.680 --> 27:54.880]  or maybe you have an old website that you are very unhappy with, like the way you go about updating
[27:54.880 --> 28:00.720]  it, or the way it looks or something like that. You and about having the back of your mind
[28:00.720 --> 28:08.320]  Squarespace as the place to go to create a new website, or recreate an old one. You just go to
[28:08.320 --> 28:14.640]  squarespace.com. You get a free trial for 30 days. And you just start picking templates. You start
[28:14.640 --> 28:19.840]  picking the features that you want on your website. Like do you need a store? Do you need
[28:19.840 --> 28:25.360]  a portfolio section to show the work that you've done? If that's the reason you're building a
[28:25.360 --> 28:31.360]  personal website? Is it like a restaurant website, or something like that? And you need like a menu
[28:31.920 --> 28:36.880]  and stuff like that? Do you have customized logos and stuff like that, that you want to add to style
[28:36.880 --> 28:42.960]  it to make it fit the brand that you are shooting for? You can do all of it within Squarespace.
[28:42.960 --> 28:48.560]  It's just you don't use apps, you don't use HTML, you don't need any of that. You just do it in the
[28:48.560 --> 28:53.760]  app in a very WYSIWYG style right within the app. And then once your site is up and running,
[28:53.760 --> 28:58.560]  everything else you need to keep it going is right there. Like you, you know, want to post to a blog
[28:58.560 --> 29:03.600]  on the site right there. Squarespace has their own CMS built in, you do it right at Squarespace.
[29:03.600 --> 29:06.800]  You want to look at the analytics, you want to see what kind of traffic you're getting,
[29:06.800 --> 29:12.400]  where it's coming from, where people are going on the site, they have fantastic analytics package,
[29:13.280 --> 29:18.160]  really, really well designed, doesn't just show you. It's not just fantastic in terms of what
[29:18.160 --> 29:24.480]  type of stuff it shows you. It's how it shows it to you. Because I find personally that most
[29:24.480 --> 29:29.200]  web analytics things are completely inscrutable. They might as well be presented in a different
[29:29.200 --> 29:34.560]  language. I don't even, I don't seldom understand what I'm looking at. Squarespace's analytics,
[29:34.560 --> 29:41.040]  super, super cool. Very, very great information design. So that's, that's my pitch to you. Keep
[29:41.040 --> 29:48.320]  them in mind the next time you have a new website to build. The next time you're fed up and want to
[29:48.320 --> 29:54.800]  replace a crappy old website with a very cool new one. Try Squarespace first. 30 day free trial,
[29:54.800 --> 29:59.920]  full thing. You're not missing anything during the free trial. And then when you do get to the

[30:24.160 --> 30:27.040]  slash talk show. Next time you want to make a new website,
[30:27.040 --> 30:38.160]  uh, iPhone 10 R. I love this thing. I'm still got it as my daily driver. I just posted before
[30:38.160 --> 30:41.520]  we started recording. I don't know if you read it, but I posted my sort of review roundup.
[30:42.320 --> 30:49.120]  I'm not surprised because I kind of felt I do. I do this every time. Sometimes like last year's
[30:49.120 --> 30:54.000]  iPhone 10. I thought, well, this is going to be a hard review to write because this thing is new
[30:54.000 --> 30:59.440]  in so many ways. There's a lot to cover. How do I, how do I make this an actual article that has
[30:59.440 --> 31:04.480]  a flow instead of just a list of bullet points? Like, here's my notes. You know, I got like a
[31:04.480 --> 31:08.640]  note, Apple notes with all the thoughts I've had before I sat down to actually write, right. And
[31:08.640 --> 31:12.720]  it's like, these are all good points. I look at it and think, wow, these are some good observations.
[31:12.720 --> 31:18.960]  And then I think this is a jumbled mess. How am I going to do this? And with the 10 R I've honestly
[31:18.960 --> 31:22.400]  thought like, this is going to be the easiest review in the world to write. It's exactly like
[31:22.400 --> 31:27.280]  a 10 S except it has a different screen, which is still kind of awesome. And it's missing the
[31:27.280 --> 31:33.280]  second camera. And I'm like, damn, how am I going to write more than that? And then, of course,
[31:33.280 --> 31:38.720]  you know, the embargo is like Tuesday, 6am. And there's no penalty. Nobody from Apple comes and
[31:38.720 --> 31:44.880]  gives you an electric shock if you miss the embargo. But they want them all to come out
[31:44.880 --> 31:53.600]  at the same time. And the selfish part of wanting to hit the embargo deadline for me isn't that I
[31:53.600 --> 32:00.800]  want to hit Apple's imposed deadline to make Apple PR happy. It's that I don't want other reviews to
[32:00.800 --> 32:05.200]  get all the links before mine comes out. Right. Like, I don't know. That's what I would think. I
[32:05.200 --> 32:08.720]  mean, I wouldn't think you would. I mean, there's no reason to care what Apple. Right. I want to go
[32:08.720 --> 32:14.640]  to Techmeme and see my review at or near the top. I don't know. Why do they care about
[32:14.640 --> 32:18.720]  all the reviews coming out at the same time? I don't see how that works for them.
[32:21.280 --> 32:25.840]  I don't. It creates a lot of buzz. And I guess maybe they figured that some people only read.
[32:25.840 --> 32:30.720]  Well, they always have an embargo. They always have an embargo, you know, so that everybody,
[32:31.680 --> 32:36.080]  you know, there has to be an embargo. Well, there doesn't have to be, but it well, I mean,
[32:36.080 --> 32:40.800]  I get the embargo, but I don't get why would they would want everybody to publish at the same time
[32:40.800 --> 32:45.440]  after the embargo? Well, maybe they don't. I don't know. I again, I've never even gotten
[32:45.440 --> 32:50.960]  the insinuation of Well, sometimes when I blow past the embargo, I will get a
[32:53.280 --> 32:57.280]  get like a very polite I message from somebody at Apple PR on whatever the team is.
[32:59.040 --> 33:03.760]  Like this happened with my series for watch review, did you lose the phone? Well, everything
[33:03.760 --> 33:12.480]  okay. You know, so the backstory this is, you know, true directors commentary behind the scenes
[33:12.480 --> 33:19.040]  of during fireball like so last month, with the number one, I'm a terrible procrastinator,
[33:19.040 --> 33:24.960]  I don't think this comes as a surprise to anybody. And I tend to start these reviews way too late.
[33:24.960 --> 33:35.920]  And it's, you know, it's just my nature. But then once I get going, it's easy to keep going,
[33:35.920 --> 33:41.280]  but it's often too late. And so I was up, literally up all night last month,
[33:41.280 --> 33:49.680]  writing my iPhone 10 s review. And because I was going to be up at six, hopefully to publish,
[33:49.680 --> 33:54.160]  even though it wasn't actually done by then I volunteered to take Jonas to school in the
[33:54.160 --> 34:01.120]  morning, which is, you know, like around 730 so that Amy could sleep in. But I wasn't done.
[34:01.680 --> 34:05.680]  So I had to take them to school and then come home and finish but I think I was done by around like
[34:05.680 --> 34:12.960]  eight. You don't know probably like 839 o'clock. But I'd been up literally been up all night
[34:12.960 --> 34:20.240]  writing it. And then and I hadn't started my series for a watch review yet. Oh, I had notes,
[34:20.240 --> 34:25.600]  you know, I'd been wearing it all week and I had copious notes. But I needed to sleep. And so I
[34:25.600 --> 34:31.120]  slept until like, I don't know, three or four in the afternoon. And then had to start writing the
[34:31.120 --> 34:36.720]  watch review. But I didn't really start until like 11 at night. And then it was like, I had to stay
[34:36.720 --> 34:42.640]  up all night again. And I, I don't know what time I put I could actually look it up. Hold on. Let
[34:42.640 --> 34:47.360]  me see if it. I know it'll say when I updated it. I don't know. I don't think I published till like
[34:47.360 --> 34:52.320]  11am. So I was like, five hours after the embargo on that one. And I did get a hey,
[34:52.320 --> 35:00.640]  I got a hey, everything. Okay. But nobody, I don't know that anybody else. There might be somebody
[35:00.640 --> 35:07.680]  did. But there I don't know if anybody else wrote reviews of both the iPhone 10. s and series for
[35:07.680 --> 35:12.000]  watch. Well, that's the thing. Like most of the other sites probably have more than one person
[35:12.000 --> 35:21.680]  working on this. Right. I don't at least my best friends in the early reviewers, the gaggle. None
[35:21.680 --> 35:28.800]  of them did both. And it was very difficult. I don't know. I don't know if you've noticed this
[35:28.800 --> 35:35.440]  either. But the older you get, the harder it is to pull it on either. Like Yeah, really? Yeah,
[35:35.440 --> 35:39.760]  that's not gonna get any easier. That's for sure. There was a time when pulling an all nighter to
[35:39.760 --> 35:44.160]  write like a newspaper article or something or even stuff for daring fireball in the early days
[35:44.160 --> 35:51.200]  was fun. And here's a story that's that's the convergence of all nighters and procrastination
[35:51.200 --> 35:58.240]  and and and things working out well is is I had to write I had a psychology class in high school.
[35:58.240 --> 36:02.320]  And I had to write had this like big we were supposed to do a big project and we're supposed
[36:02.320 --> 36:09.360]  to have empirical research. And I didn't do anything about it until like the day before.
[36:09.360 --> 36:14.960]  I was like, and then it hit me like, oh, crap, we were supposed to like do practical research on
[36:14.960 --> 36:21.840]  this. And so the thing I came up with was, I'll stay up all night. I'll take my my respiration
[36:21.840 --> 36:27.440]  and my you know, my heart rate and and my temperature. And there's my empirical research.
[36:28.080 --> 36:36.640]  And I got like an A minus. That's actually very clever. It is. I typed it up on a typewriter too.
[36:36.640 --> 36:40.960]  It is sort of sort of like inception in some way.
[36:42.560 --> 36:43.920]  It feels like it after a while.
[36:45.680 --> 36:52.800]  Amy and I were just talking about that we we went to college in the fall of 1991. And we both went
[36:52.800 --> 36:59.360]  to college or no, I got a I got a Mac in college. But it Amy went to school with her typewriter.
[37:00.160 --> 37:03.840]  Because Drexel University had like a program where they, they didn't make you buy a Mac,
[37:03.840 --> 37:08.880]  but they, everybody had to, quote, have access to a Mac. So you either had to get one or you had
[37:08.880 --> 37:13.920]  to go to the you. You got coursework that required a Macintosh. And so you did, you know, if you
[37:13.920 --> 37:17.600]  didn't own one, you'd have to go to the computer lab. And there were the computer lab admittedly
[37:17.600 --> 37:24.960]  was very nice. What was it? Korman k o r m a n. And that was also Korman was also where even if
[37:24.960 --> 37:31.200]  you owned one, you could go with blank floppy disks and get legally licensed copies of lots
[37:31.200 --> 37:36.560]  and lots of apps like Microsoft Excel, like that, like a university wide site license to excel.
[37:36.560 --> 37:41.040]  Okay. Like, and, you know, when I first, you know, first got a Mac,
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.680]  and didn't really know anybody, and you know, modems were like $10,000 or something.
[37:47.120 --> 37:53.040]  You know, that was really nice. You know, by like, a couple months in, you know, getting
[37:53.040 --> 37:59.520]  getting a copy of any well known app was no longer a problem for me. But it was very nice for those
[37:59.520 --> 38:06.320]  who were less into the wares. I remember the other kid because I would I didn't have a computer
[38:06.320 --> 38:12.880]  until I went to graduate school. And I remember that the lab was the first place I saw anybody
[38:12.880 --> 38:20.240]  play a networked game I think was on strategic conquest. Hmm. was like the hot game in the in
[38:20.240 --> 38:25.680]  the Mac lab at the at the University of Washington. What else was there? I played that for years
[38:25.680 --> 38:31.520]  bolo. There was bolo. Remember that? I don't remember bolo. b o l. Oh, I forget.
[38:32.640 --> 38:37.440]  Strategic conquest, you say? All right. Oh, yeah. All right. I'll put it in the stroke.
[38:37.440 --> 38:42.960]  Show notes. Did you see the there's a book out called the secret history of Mac gaming?
[38:43.920 --> 38:47.280]  Oh, no, I did not see that. Oh, I'll put that in the show notes. Yeah.
[38:48.800 --> 38:54.960]  I haven't read it yet. But it's like, it is such a nice book that it's like, the reason I haven't
[38:54.960 --> 39:01.680]  read it is I'm like saving it until until like, I can really enjoy it. I it's a terrible habit,
[39:01.680 --> 39:06.000]  but like, the better a book is sometimes with movies, too. It's like, I'm really looking
[39:06.000 --> 39:12.400]  forward to this movie, but I don't want to watch it if I'm not like, exactly in the right mood
[39:12.400 --> 39:16.080]  and the lighting everything, you know, I don't want to watch it. There's a full moon and it's
[39:16.080 --> 39:22.160]  too much sunlight coming through the windows. You know, let's wait till it's darker. Secret history
[39:22.160 --> 39:28.080]  of Mac gaming bolo. What else did I mention? Do you want to talk about the reviews a little?
[39:28.080 --> 39:33.200]  There's a couple of details that are interesting in these other reviews that you that you bring up.
[39:33.200 --> 39:36.960]  Yes. Yeah. And the one that I think is the funniest is the one that Renee noticed.
[39:37.920 --> 39:43.280]  Yes, the misaligned lightning port. Yeah, the lightning port is slightly misaligned in the
[39:44.400 --> 39:51.760]  I don't think I would probably ever have noticed either. Looking at it, I can't believe I didn't
[39:51.760 --> 39:55.600]  notice it. I really thought you would have noticed it. I would have ever I cannot believe
[39:55.600 --> 40:02.160]  I didn't notice it. So I, I wrote in the thing that I didn't that Renee's was the first review
[40:02.160 --> 40:06.800]  I read where somebody called it out and he had a photo illustrating it. But like, after my review
[40:06.800 --> 40:10.800]  went up, somebody a friend from Apple was like, I can't believe you didn't mention the lightning
[40:10.800 --> 40:15.200]  port. And I'm like, What? What's wrong with the lightning port? And I looked at it and I was like,
[40:15.200 --> 40:22.960]  what? I can't believe it. I think that my friend at Apple is like, yeah, the display controller is
[40:22.960 --> 40:30.000]  a bitch. Yeah, so it isn't randomly placed. So for those of you who haven't read this, or didn't,
[40:30.000 --> 40:35.280]  you know, didn't read it, the gist of it is that Apple tradition always likes to center align
[40:35.280 --> 40:40.080]  everything on the bottom. So if there's like, speakers, or, you know, in the newer phone speaker
[40:40.080 --> 40:47.760]  grills, and the screws that hold everything in, and the lightning port, and there used to be a
[40:47.760 --> 40:52.480]  thing, there used to be like a circular port where you could plug in like audio devices.
[40:53.760 --> 40:58.480]  Was I gonna it was weird. It wasn't even digital. It was like an analog. I vaguely remember that.
[40:58.480 --> 41:02.800]  Yeah, well, that one was in there all center aligned with each other. They're all center
[41:02.800 --> 41:08.560]  aligned on the bottom, my phone, my phone still has that. But well, on the bottom of a phone,
[41:08.560 --> 41:14.560]  about that later, maybe, and the iPhone 10 are the lightning port is, is lower. So if the phone
[41:14.560 --> 41:21.360]  is laying on its back, screen up, the lightning port is lower on the bottom of the phone than the
[41:21.360 --> 41:28.720]  speaker grills or the screws. It's not randomly placed, like some of the things on some Samsung
[41:28.720 --> 41:34.240]  phones seemingly are its top aligned. So the top of the lightning port is aligned with the top of
[41:34.240 --> 41:39.200]  the screws and speaker grills. But the bottom is lower because it's not centered. And it's,
[41:40.080 --> 41:43.840]  it's not, but it can't, it's just because it can't be pushed up any further. No.
[41:45.680 --> 41:52.560]  I actually think, though, that it's, it's less noticeable than the fact that the on the 10 s,
[41:52.560 --> 41:58.480]  the speaker grills are not symmetric, because there's that new antenna line, you know, so
[41:58.480 --> 42:04.160]  there's only like three completely like three holes on the one side and seven holes or six
[42:04.160 --> 42:08.400]  saw on the other side. So it's way less noticeable than that. But I couldn't believe it.
[42:09.120 --> 42:14.240]  Yeah. Although that harkens back to what did the antenna lines were
[42:15.520 --> 42:18.000]  off on either side on the four, right?
[42:20.400 --> 42:20.900]  Yeah.
[42:21.360 --> 42:23.760]  Yeah. And then they fixed that in the
[42:25.760 --> 42:28.080]  US or something when they fixed it, but they fixed it later.
[42:28.640 --> 42:33.440]  Yeah. Or maybe with the four s because the four s it was and it was weird because the iPhone four
[42:33.440 --> 42:37.360]  is the weirdest phone in history because there were two of them with totally different antenna
[42:37.360 --> 42:42.960]  lines because the Verizon one was really more like the iPhone four and a half. Because it came out
[42:42.960 --> 42:48.720]  six months later, or at least like five months later, it was like January. And it had different
[42:48.720 --> 42:54.320]  antenna lines that didn't have the attenuation problem that the iPhone four had and, and it
[42:54.320 --> 42:59.520]  ended up being the same antenna lines that the iPhone four s had later in the year. Right.
[42:59.520 --> 43:08.400]  Right. Yeah, I thought that was weird. I'll bet I would even bet that if you could measure
[43:08.400 --> 43:14.400]  how far lower the lightning port is in like 10th of a millimeter from being centered,
[43:14.960 --> 43:22.240]  that it's probably almost exactly how much thicker the iPhone 10 is overall than the 10 s.
[43:22.240 --> 43:28.080]  Like it's, you know, like, because it's, I don't, I guess I actually it's probably because today's
[43:28.080 --> 43:32.880]  Friday and the iPhone 10 are actually shipped today to people. iFixit probably does have it
[43:32.880 --> 43:38.160]  taken apart. They do. Yeah, that's out already. Yeah. Because they go to Australia. God bless
[43:38.160 --> 43:43.920]  them for their dedication to that. Yeah, that's crazy. Well, I know you're not the biggest fan
[43:43.920 --> 43:52.960]  of flying. I wouldn't do that. But anyway, that's a hell of a long flight. And I would not do it
[43:52.960 --> 43:59.520]  for the sake of getting my tear down up on day one. I would wait. Well, they must have I don't
[43:59.520 --> 44:03.120]  know if this just didn't load fully when I loaded it the first time. Well, they were still putting
[44:03.120 --> 44:07.360]  up pieces of it. I'm not going to read it while we're recording. But I just know that the display
[44:07.360 --> 44:15.520]  controller is under the display. And it adds some serious thickness. And it either prevents them
[44:15.520 --> 44:20.560]  from adding the layer for 3d touch because 3d touch is literally a layer. It's not like just
[44:20.560 --> 44:28.320]  a conceptual layer. It is actually a layer on phones that have 3d touch. So either the display
[44:28.320 --> 44:33.360]  controller being under the screen prevents them from adding 3d touch or 3d touch would have made
[44:33.360 --> 44:37.520]  it even thicker and they deemed it it'd be better to just leave it off than off then make the phone
[44:37.520 --> 44:44.480]  even thicker and more and or more expensive. Anyway, long story short, one of the things that
[44:44.480 --> 44:48.960]  come out of this and and neelai Patel and his review in the verge had some great, great details,
[44:48.960 --> 44:55.920]  I think with like a microscope, to look at the sub pixels. And I think Matthew Panzarino had some
[44:55.920 --> 45:01.200]  of these details to I kind of glossed over. But there's just an insane amount of engineering work
[45:01.200 --> 45:09.040]  that Apple did to get an LCD screen to go edge to edge. And I've been, I said this, I asked Apple,
[45:09.040 --> 45:15.120]  you know, does anybody else have an LCD phone with no chin or forehead? And Apple, you know,
[45:15.120 --> 45:20.000]  you know, this isn't for the record, this is, you know, just off the record talking to people in
[45:20.000 --> 45:26.320]  Apple product marketing. And, you know, not that they're aware of was their answer, they, you know,
[45:26.320 --> 45:29.680]  but who knows, I mean, there's a gazillion phones out there. But I wrote that in my review,
[45:29.680 --> 45:35.440]  and nobody wrote in to correct me like, oh, the, you know, the LG something, something from 2015
[45:35.440 --> 45:40.960]  is LCD and goes edge to edge. No, apparently, nobody else has a phone that goes edge to edge.
[45:40.960 --> 45:47.040]  It's just that hard with LCD. And it's really hard with OLED, too. If you look at how many
[45:47.040 --> 45:50.480]  the OLED phones out there, like the Google pixels to have it still have the chin,
[45:51.040 --> 45:54.640]  down at the bottom, they go, you know, they have the notch or whatever at the top.
[45:56.560 --> 46:00.480]  But they still don't have to go all the way to the bottom. It's just really, really hard with
[46:00.480 --> 46:05.840]  OLED. And with LCD, it's like, impossible, but somehow Apple's done it. And they've done this
[46:05.840 --> 46:13.520]  crazy, crazy detailed work to make the corners, the round corners look perfectly round without
[46:13.520 --> 46:18.000]  like jagged lines and stuff. It's it's insane. That's what I thought was so interesting about
[46:18.000 --> 46:21.920]  those two. Those two notes was basically that the you know, they, where they could,
[46:22.480 --> 46:26.880]  where they could physically do an attention to detail that would make it more perfect, they
[46:26.880 --> 46:31.360]  they do it. And then in the one place where they just physically can't do it, they have to do
[46:31.360 --> 46:35.600]  something else. Right. And I guess I don't know what else they considered with the lightning port,
[46:35.600 --> 46:41.440]  like they could have kept them centered aligned by moving the speaker grills and screw down and
[46:41.440 --> 46:46.240]  have everything closer to the edge. But I think that would look worse. I'm sure they prototyped
[46:46.240 --> 46:52.400]  it and say, well, that's even uglier to have everything pushed down. Yeah, but it's a small
[46:52.400 --> 46:58.080]  compromise. I honestly think it's less of a guy. I think it's less of a compromise that we didn't
[46:58.080 --> 47:03.600]  notice. I think it's way less of a compromise than the asymmetric antenna lines on the tennis,
[47:03.600 --> 47:09.520]  which are there to support the quote unquote, I would definitely agree with that. Yeah.
[47:10.640 --> 47:14.320]  And that one kind of annoys me. I mean, who knows, maybe it's coming to Philadelphia. But as far as
[47:14.320 --> 47:20.960]  my like speed test testing shows, I don't have gigabit LTE. So I've got the ugly and asymmetric
[47:20.960 --> 47:28.240]  antenna lines. And I'm, I'm not getting any benefit for it. Yeah. So the other thing I noted
[47:28.240 --> 47:32.640]  in the review, and I really thought I just thought it was, you know, that there are two reviews,
[47:32.640 --> 47:36.720]  like I have the quote from both of them recent guests on the show, in fact,
[47:36.720 --> 47:42.640]  Neelai Patel and Matthew Panzerino. You know, obviously, the two big compromises in the 10 are
[47:42.640 --> 47:48.720]  compared to the tennis are the display, which is LCD instead of OLED. And the fact that it only
[47:48.720 --> 47:53.520]  has one camera on the back doesn't have the telephoto. And I just thought it was so almost
[47:53.520 --> 48:02.400]  comical how perfect their comments were, where Matthew said that he likes telephoto lens so
[48:02.400 --> 48:06.640]  much that he thinks 80% of his photos over the last year were shot with the telephoto.
[48:06.640 --> 48:11.760]  And he wishes he could set a preference so that when he starts the camera app, it starts in 2x
[48:11.760 --> 48:16.320]  mode, and he has to hit the button to go to the wider angle lens, as opposed to the way it works
[48:16.320 --> 48:20.640]  now, where you always start in a wide angle. And Neelai Patel said, I almost never use the
[48:20.640 --> 48:27.760]  telephoto lens. And really focused heavily on the specific, you know, deficiencies of the LCD
[48:27.760 --> 48:34.320]  compared to the OLED display, you know, yeah, really, really, you know, and I again, like I
[48:34.320 --> 48:38.160]  wrote, it's neither one of them are wrong. It's subjective, but it's so interesting that they both
[48:38.160 --> 48:42.640]  have the different, different opinion. Yeah, I think I would, I think I would probably go with
[48:42.640 --> 48:46.400]  the panzerino because I just I don't mind. I think it's my eyes are so bad. Now. I don't notice the
[48:46.400 --> 48:51.840]  difference between these kinds of, you know, the finer detail on the screens. Yeah, I think so. I
[48:51.840 --> 48:58.160]  think that's part of my problem, too. Or at least you know that. Yeah, I don't see it. And I remember
[48:58.880 --> 49:04.400]  when the iPhone four first came out, because that was the first retina screen. And it had the same
[49:04.400 --> 49:10.640]  resolution, which is a point I want to come back to that it was 326 pixels per inch. So that was
[49:10.640 --> 49:16.080]  2010. And that was only eight years ago. But I remember, see, boy, that feels like a long eight
[49:16.080 --> 49:21.840]  years. Yeah, geez. Because that was, I think I've told this story before, but that was the first
[49:21.840 --> 49:29.040]  time I ever talked to Steve Jobs was in the hands on area at WWDC after the iPhone four was
[49:29.040 --> 49:35.360]  introduced. Was that the one where Mossberg was sitting on the table? No, that was the iPad. That
[49:35.360 --> 49:40.560]  was the original iPad. So that would be like a year later, I think. Oh, no, no, it would have
[49:40.560 --> 49:46.240]  been earlier that same year earlier the year earlier in 2010. I should tell this story. I
[49:46.240 --> 49:53.600]  think I've told it before. Maybe not. I tend to be a little secretive with the I I don't have
[49:53.600 --> 49:59.200]  extensive experience talking to Steve Jobs. But the first time I did was was after the iPhone for
[49:59.200 --> 50:04.480]  2010. Hands on area in Moscone. You know, this, I think it was the last phone that was Yeah,
[50:04.480 --> 50:14.400]  it was definitely last phone that debuted at WWDC. Big hands on area. And it was more pronounced
[50:14.400 --> 50:20.720]  back then than now, I think. But there was always this weird, and it was still early in my time is
[50:20.720 --> 50:26.560]  like, somebody who has a badge to a press badge to go to these things and go to the hands on area
[50:26.560 --> 50:31.200]  afterwards. And there's it's still this the case where as soon as the event is over, there's this
[50:31.200 --> 50:35.840]  like scrum to get there and start getting photos of these devices and touch them and you have to
[50:35.840 --> 50:40.560]  wait and people are crowded around and it's like, and then very quickly, it empties out because
[50:40.560 --> 50:45.120]  everybody so many of these, you know, people have to file, you know, it's like, I got to get my post
[50:45.120 --> 50:48.960]  up. I got a post, I got to write, I got to get my pictures, I got to go see an airplane where they
[50:48.960 --> 50:52.320]  all go running out and they knock her over the Yeah, exactly. And then all of a sudden, it's like
[50:52.320 --> 50:56.400]  empty. And then you get to like, play with them all to yourselves. And then, you know, but anyway,
[50:56.400 --> 51:02.800]  I have, I actually talked to Scott forced all at that, that I just saw him standing by himself,
[51:02.800 --> 51:08.400]  and I went up and introduced myself and had, you know, terribly afraid that he'd have no idea who
[51:08.400 --> 51:14.560]  I was. And instead, he knew exactly who I was, and was said, he reads my site all the time and
[51:14.560 --> 51:20.720]  mentioned something I'd recently written, and we had a wonderful conversation. And then I was
[51:20.720 --> 51:24.400]  talking to Katie cotton, and who I'd met her before, because she, of course, knows everybody
[51:24.400 --> 51:28.960]  was in the meat. She knew everybody was in the media. And then she said, Hey, would you like to
[51:28.960 --> 51:33.840]  talk to Steve? And I literally, this is my reply. I literally said, Does anybody ever say no to that?
[51:33.840 --> 51:39.200]  And she laughed and said, actually, no, nobody has ever said that. And then she walked me over
[51:39.200 --> 51:43.040]  and introduced me to Steve Jobs. And we talked about the fun. He was like, well, of course,
[51:43.040 --> 51:50.000]  his first question was, so what do you think? And I just, I did. It still is one of my it's probably
[51:50.000 --> 51:56.400]  my I'd been waiting for what Apple calls retina to screens for forever. They used to call them
[51:56.400 --> 52:02.720]  high DPI. And there were cable Sasser. And I've been obsessed with this, I don't know, 10 years
[52:02.720 --> 52:06.240]  prior to the iPhone four, but when everybody thought it would come to the Mac first,
[52:06.800 --> 52:12.000]  and there were WWDC sessions, I forget how many years before, but they used to call it high DPI.
[52:12.000 --> 52:15.280]  And it was like, get your software ready for high DPI. And like panic,
[52:15.280 --> 52:22.560]  it changed all of the assets in all of their apps from like bitmap images to PDFs,
[52:23.360 --> 52:28.640]  so that they'd be scalable. And it never happened for the Mac until like, I don't know,
[52:28.640 --> 52:33.440]  whenever retina max came out, and they did it in a totally different way where retina max, you know,
[52:33.440 --> 52:37.680]  they did this whole like, two x three x thing where you could still use bitmaps because they
[52:37.680 --> 52:42.240]  were precise size. Like, back in the day, everybody was anticipating that, you know,
[52:42.240 --> 52:46.320]  high resolution interfaces would be like PDFs, where you could scale them, you could go like
[52:46.320 --> 52:53.520]  96% 93% 94%. So I was super excited about the iPhone four, because it's the first time
[52:53.520 --> 53:01.280]  I'd ever seen a truly high resolution device. And it looked amazing. And we were talking about it.
[53:01.280 --> 53:04.560]  And we were talking about in the iPhone. In addition to being retina, the iPhone four was
[53:04.560 --> 53:10.880]  the first one where the display was fused to the glass. And so that it eliminated the sort of
[53:10.880 --> 53:16.960]  parallax of the distance from the surface of the glass to the screen. It was so much better in so
[53:16.960 --> 53:21.040]  many ways. It wasn't just like, oh, we've got two pixels for every one pixel, it was just like,
[53:21.040 --> 53:25.760]  whole, it just felt like they'd leap left 10 years ahead in display technology in one year.
[53:27.520 --> 53:33.840]  But the, the other thing about being fusing the display to the glass is in addition to being
[53:34.560 --> 53:40.320]  better to look at, and especially better to look at at an angle. It also means there's no air gap
[53:40.320 --> 53:46.880]  between them. And I don't know, did you had early iPhones, right? Like the like the iPhone, 3g and
[53:46.880 --> 53:51.760]  3gs. Because there was an air gap very small, but there was an air gap between the display and the
[53:51.760 --> 53:57.360]  touch the glass, you could get like a piece of dust in there. I don't know if that ever happened
[53:57.360 --> 54:04.720]  to you. It happened to me. I don't think it No, I don't remember that happened fairly early on. And
[54:04.720 --> 54:11.520]  so I'd spent an entire year with this one piece of dust in a very prominent location. And so I was
[54:11.520 --> 54:16.640]  talking to Steve Jobs about this, the iPhone four, and how, how much, you know, all these details
[54:16.640 --> 54:21.840]  about the display. And I got to the air gap part. And I was like, so with this, you know, the screen
[54:21.840 --> 54:27.040]  being fused, there's literally no air gap anymore. And then he told me, yeah, no air gap at all. But
[54:27.040 --> 54:32.400]  they had to build their own machines to do it and ship them all over to China like that, that Apple
[54:32.400 --> 54:36.400]  built these machines to do it because no, you know, there are no other displays that didn't
[54:36.400 --> 54:40.560]  have an air gap. And I said, so you couldn't then therefore something like this couldn't happen. And
[54:40.560 --> 54:47.520]  I took out my iPhone 3g and showed him the piece of dust. It looks at me and he just says no,
[54:47.520 --> 54:57.200]  that can't happen. But with no apology whatsoever. You didn't rush somebody over to get you a
[54:57.200 --> 55:02.880]  replacement. But it was all in all it was. It was all about how awesome the iPhone four was. So yeah,
[55:02.880 --> 55:12.400]  that can't happen anymore. Yeah. That's, that's one of my Steve Jobs stories. Twice. How many
[55:12.400 --> 55:17.920]  times did you talk to him twice? And then once I got an email, okay. But not because I wrote to
[55:17.920 --> 55:25.200]  him, he wrote to me. What did you do? I've never told this story either. He effectively, it was
[55:25.200 --> 55:32.480]  very strange. He effectively told me the iCloud strategy, like 11 months in advance. Because I had
[55:32.480 --> 55:38.480]  written something. I had written a piece on during fireball complaining about the the fact that you
[55:38.480 --> 55:45.440]  still had to like sync to iTunes on your Mac to get like your contacts and and certain things.
[55:46.960 --> 55:53.280]  He wrote me an email and he just it just started. I read during fireball, or it started off the
[55:53.280 --> 55:58.080]  record. I read during fireball, and then he didn't say use the name, but he effectively told me
[55:58.080 --> 56:07.440]  they're working on it. And it was, you know, like, holy shit. Yeah. And I wrote back to him, I took
[56:07.440 --> 56:12.000]  me like a day to like figure out how to write back and then never heard from him. I never heard from
[56:12.000 --> 56:18.640]  him again. Who is this? I got the email before I met him, though, at the WWDC. And so I actually
[56:18.640 --> 56:21.920]  asked him, I was like, Hey, I just want to double check a couple months ago, I got an email from
[56:21.920 --> 56:30.880]  you. And he was like, Yeah. And I was like, Okay, I still never was 100% sure. Right. Somebody
[56:30.880 --> 56:35.200]  spoofed it. No, but I guess actually, I now that I think about it, I guess he actually,
[56:35.200 --> 56:39.440]  what he outlined to me as their long term strategy was over a year in advance, because
[56:40.000 --> 56:47.440]  iCloud didn't come out till his last year 2011 at WWDC. But it was effectively, you know,
[56:47.440 --> 56:51.600]  I don't think he used the phrase, but it was effectively a in the future that, you know,
[56:51.600 --> 56:56.160]  the truth will be in the cloud, as opposed to, you know, that it will move to the cloud will be the
[56:56.160 --> 57:04.320]  center of your data experience, not your Mac. He just told it all to me. It was it was very
[57:04.320 --> 57:13.440]  strange. So anytime you take little bird, you meant Steve Jobs? Yeah.
[57:15.760 --> 57:21.680]  Anyway, 10 are reviews. I love this friggin phone. It is so great. I'm just blown away by
[57:21.680 --> 57:27.760]  how much I like it. I wish it was which was smaller. Well, that's, you know, that is the
[57:27.760 --> 57:33.360]  thing. And I will say that one of the best aspects of it, it does feel smaller to me
[57:33.360 --> 57:40.640]  than the tennis Max, like the max thing is just not for me. I will it is smaller. It is and it
[57:40.640 --> 57:48.720]  feels smaller. And it feels to me subjectively more like a big tennis and less like a small tennis
[57:48.720 --> 57:57.200]  Max, in that I feel like if I had to use this phone for the next 11 months, I'd be I wouldn't
[57:57.200 --> 58:05.600]  be annoyed. But it's funny how a little little difference here and there to me makes a difference
[58:05.600 --> 58:10.640]  in hand. Because I've also I bought a couple cases for and I'm still want to write about it. I think
[58:10.640 --> 58:15.600]  it's so weird that Apple doesn't have any cases yet for the iPhone 10. So I bought a couple of
[58:15.600 --> 58:21.200]  third party cases like on Amazon. I bought a leather one from a company called Bellroy,
[58:21.200 --> 58:26.560]  who I'm a fan of their wallets and stuff. They sponsored during fireball, like five, six years
[58:26.560 --> 58:30.880]  ago. It's been a while. But I should mention that that they were a one time sponsor of during
[58:30.880 --> 58:34.640]  firewall, but I just liked their products. And I bought a Bellroy case for the 10 are
[58:36.080 --> 58:41.840]  and putting any case on it makes it feel too big to me. It's like it's like it pushes it over like
[58:42.480 --> 58:46.640]  the way it feels with no cases like the upper limit of what I consider reasonable. But the
[58:46.640 --> 58:52.000]  best part about it is I will stop using it because I'm not buying one. I already have a tennis and my
[58:52.000 --> 58:59.200]  tennis feels so nice and small now. Maybe I guess that's maybe what I should do to segue away from
[58:59.200 --> 59:06.320]  Yeah, the SC is like, get it get a tennis Max. Get an eight get an eight plus borrow somebody's
[59:06.320 --> 59:14.080]  eight plus because the eight plus and again, you put the the plus size the 678 plus size phones
[59:14.080 --> 59:21.040]  next to the tennis Max and they they're like, it's like they're about the same. It's like the 10 s
[59:21.040 --> 59:27.840]  is bigger, taller, but it is a little narrower. But for some reason, that minimal like the
[59:27.840 --> 59:35.200]  millimeter or two difference in width is noticeable. But get it. And I guess just looking
[59:35.200 --> 59:40.880]  at the phone with the seemingly antiquated forehead and chin. It all just seems puffy,
[59:40.880 --> 59:45.760]  feels bloated. It's like the best way to get used to a bigger iPhone is to get the eight plus and
[59:45.760 --> 59:51.200]  you try using that for a while. Okay, well, so anyway, well, we can we can mention my when my
[59:51.200 --> 59:56.320]  se dies. So you're you're using an iPhone se I put this in the show notes that we share the show
[59:56.320 --> 01:00:02.960]  notes and apple notes and then Caleb Sexton who edits the show is also on the shared note. And he
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:09.840]  usually doesn't do this. He added a note. He changed the section from moltz iPhone se to
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:17.040]  moltz and Caleb's iPhone, iPhone se and he wrote the note. I'll never give it up. I'll go to the
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:27.120]  grave with a tiny phone. Caleb. Yeah. That is I I'm not gonna go that far. But I'm gonna use it.
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:33.840]  I'm gonna use it until it goes to the grave. I think it in the long term trend. It is absolutely
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:43.200]  the the the other the the elephant in the room. There's some kind of pun about, you know, big
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:48.080]  ass phones and elephants, I guess but the elephant in the room with the 2018 iPhone lineup is that
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:53.360]  all of a sudden the smallest new iPhone is actually quite large, which is the iPhone XS.
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:01:04.880]  Yeah. Even the, you know, you're on an SE, which is just tiny compared to these phones. But even
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:09.200]  the iPhone seven, not plus just regular seven, I had it out. I always end up getting them out
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:14.800]  to compare this or that when I'm writing these reviews, and I had it out. And Amy saw it and she
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:19.360]  was like, Oh my god, that's so nice. Isn't that nice? I was like, Yeah, it is actually.
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:26.000]  It's the smallest new iPhone you can get is actually quite large. And then
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:33.280]  I think it's, I don't know, I'm still holding on just and I don't think that there's any hope
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:37.920]  currently of anything getting any smaller than the than the tennis.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:45.760]  I disagree. I think that there is a chance that they will. I don't know what they're going to
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:52.400]  call them next year. Because one of the other weird things about these tennis and 10 are names
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:59.840]  is the 10 s just tack and s is fits right along with a whole bunch of other previous
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:05.360]  s phones s iPhones where the industrial design is almost the same, maybe they move the camera around
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:10.560]  a little bit. Which is annoying because then you have to buy a new case if you already had a case
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:18.160]  for the other one, but they move the camera around a little bit or the, you know, the five s, I think
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:23.280]  I'm almost certain was the first one with touch ID. So instead of having an old fashioned, simple
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:29.120]  home button had a, you know, touch ID button, which is, you know, obviously a visual form factor
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:34.960]  change, but it was in the same position. But the 10 r is all new, right? It is it's literally a
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:44.000]  new size. It is it's new colors. It's clearly not based on any previous iPhone. But they're not I
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:50.160]  can't. I can't believe they would call a phone next year the 10 r s. Although maybe they would
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:55.520]  maybe I'm overthinking it. Right? That they they'll just come out with another one that
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:01.920]  looks like the 10 r and call it the 10 r s because it's Yeah, I guess I don't know. It just seems
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:05.680]  crazy to know where they go. I just can't believe though, that they'd only do one year of this,
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:10.800]  that they'd put all this work into this. We talked 15 minutes ago about how much insane engineering
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:14.960]  and design work went into making this LCD go corner to corner. Why in the world would they
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:21.760]  do it for only one year? It doesn't make sense. But I actually think, you know, and I do this
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.200]  all the time. And I don't even know if it's worthwhile, but I spent like, I swear to God
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:32.000]  hours in a spreadsheet working out, you know, the pixels per inch and dots per inch of the various,
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.480]  all these phones in the various scaling, you know, you can go to, on these bigger phones,
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:41.760]  you can go to the settings display, and change the scaling from standard to zoomed.
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:48.720]  When you do that, though, and look at all the math, and especially when you look at the points,
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:53.120]  not pixels, where, you know, meaning the different I tried to get in this my review,
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.880]  I hope I didn't lose people doesn't seem like I did, because nobody wrote to me with any confusion,
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:02.080]  but maybe they just skipped over it. Yeah. Just look for the next subhead.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:10.800]  But it's not that hard. It might be it might be a mistake it for me to try to write about it in
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:16.400]  words, because I feel like maybe it's better illustrated visually. But basically, it's like,
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:22.880]  if you think of a sheet of graph paper, and there's like, think of like the main, the main
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:29.040]  sheets, the main squares being like, the points, but then you divide every one of those squares
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:35.600]  into two, like a two by two array, that's a two x retina screen, where the points are the
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:40.880]  the big squares. And the pixels of the actual physical display are the little squares within
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:46.560]  the square. So there are four per Yeah, four pixels per point. And in a three x retina display,
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:52.240]  like the 10 s, you'd get a three by three array, like a tic tac toe board of nine, nine per point,
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:57.520]  right. But if you just look at the points, because like, like, if you and if you just think of like,
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:04.400]  16 point text, like if you just take the system font, and you say, give me 16 point text in the
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:13.520]  system font and write the word iPhone, the letter I rendered at 16 points is going to be the exact
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:18.800]  same size, whether it's two x or three x, it's the exact same number of big squares, it's just
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:24.720]  each sub square has finer detail, because it's either a two by two, or a three by three within.
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:32.880]  And when you look at that, and you look at the phones in terms of points, there's two point
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:38.880]  resolutions, there's the standard resolution of the 10 s, and the standard resolution of the 10 s
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:45.600]  max, where the max is just bigger in both directions, and has more points. But when you
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:50.320]  use scaling on the 10 s max, and you say, give me the zoomed interface, which makes everything
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:56.800]  a little bit bigger, it just uses the exact same number of points as the 10 s, and just zooms them
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:03.040]  up. So you're getting like, like a screenshot taken on the 10 s, and a screenshot taken on the
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:10.160]  10 s max in zoomed mode, do the same well, except that it would be physically bigger. You know what
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:16.880]  I mean? Yeah, right, right. It's a lot like it's like, it's like exactly like the the iPad, iPad
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:22.240]  Mini versus the regular iPad of your when they were the exact same pixel for pixel. It's just
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:30.320]  that the iPad Mini use smaller pixels and pack the same interface into a smaller thing. So the 10
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:39.680]  are has the exact same two scaling sizes as the 10 s max. And so when you're in the standard zoom,
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:46.000]  just the default, if you just use standard pixel for point for point, I mean, it's the exact same
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:53.440]  same interface as the 10 s max. It's just that each point is two by two pixels instead of three
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:07:00.240]  by three. And when you zoom, it's like a scaled up 10 s pixel for pixel, or point for point. I mean,
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:06.880]  see, even I get confused. But so and the 10 s not max, just the regular 10 act 10 s doesn't have
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:12.640]  a scaling option. So you can't there is no zoom on the tennis because it already is the smaller
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:19.440]  of the modern 10 class phones. So I feel like what is would naturally slot into this product
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:25.280]  array weird would be a smaller 10 are well that's Yeah, and I was just thinking looking at that,
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:31.760]  I mean, that would be what I would like it would. And so what I'm imagining, and I think it would be
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:37.760]  very natural would be it would be an LCD screen, it would be 326 pixels per inch exactly like the
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:44.080]  10 are, except instead of being 6.1 inches diagonal, it would be only 5.5 inches diagonal,
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:51.440]  so it would be like a third of an inch smaller than the tennis body, the would the body be that
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:55.920]  much smaller? Yes, early because it's because the one of the bezels not that big, but well,
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:00.480]  it is big enough, though. But the other thing that I figured out looking at all of this is that the
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:07.680]  tennis, I think, is actually would be more accurately described as a 5.9 inch display, not
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:13.760]  5.8. I think that when you look at it, and I actually even bought a couple months ago, one of
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:19.600]  these, they're real cheap. I, I'm really glad I bought it. Like 15 bucks on Amazon, you can get
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:27.360]  like a digital caliper that measures like literally to like the 100. It claims to measure to the
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:34.320]  thousandth of an inch, but I mean, I can't believe you know, that's like microns. Using that, and
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:38.800]  doing like some Pythagorean theorem based on because Apple tells you how, you know, you can
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:42.480]  measure how wide the screen is, and they tell you how many pixels printed supposed to be and you
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:47.360]  know how many pixels there are. So if you just do a little a squared plus the square root of, you
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:55.680]  know, the two sides at the right angle is the length of the diagonal of a triangle. It actually
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:04.720]  works out to like 5.859 or something like that. Like it really is, it seems more like 5.86,
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:14.160]  which should round up to 5.9 inches. Whereas I, the, yeah. So that's taking it to the curve?
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:19.440]  No, not the curve. No, and Apple, even in their footnote, admits that their measurements are taken
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:25.760]  where the hypothetical perfect rectangle of the display would be. Which seems a little bit
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:32.400]  questionable, but it really makes sense if you think about it. It is fair if you think about it.
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:35.200]  Well, most of the screen does fit that.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:38.160]  Right, because most of the thing is, you know, and you don't really scroll diagonally,
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:44.080]  you scroll up and down. And it just any, you know, long story short, it just seems like they could,
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:48.880]  you know, they would just have point, it would be the same points as the iPhone 10S,
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:53.520]  except they'd be, each pixel would actually be a little smaller. It's a 163 pixel
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:10:01.760]  points per inch, as opposed to 153 points per inch on the standard scaling of the 10S
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:06.640]  and 10S Max. Everything's just a little bigger point for point on the 10S and 10S Max.
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:13.760]  And that was true on the plus size phones, too, the 8 Plus and the 7 Plus, 6 Plus, 6S Plus.
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:19.680]  Those phones point for point made everything a little bigger, too, in addition to showing more
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:28.480]  stuff. So anyway, a 5.5 inch diagonal 10R next year, it would be quite a bit smaller than even
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:33.120]  the 10S. You'd notice it. You'd notice it as being smaller in the same way that you notice that
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:39.840]  that the 10R is smaller than the 10S Max. Right. And I think it would make a lot of people happy.
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:43.840]  And I think it would be a natural, I think it would, I think it would be very natural, you know,
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:50.800]  and it almost fits the pattern where they come out with these 10 class phones the first year
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:55.920]  in one size. And then now that they, you know, then come out with the second size the second year.
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:01.520]  Yeah, it's just that instead of starting small and going a little bit more of the size of this
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:08.400]  of a seven, but yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever, it might be even a little smaller than a seven or
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:16.880]  eight, maybe. But about this display in the seven is 4.7. Yeah, but it's no good because it's not
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:21.760]  corner to corner. Yeah, no, I know. Yeah, I know. It's just what you need is you trying to eyeball
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:25.520]  it. But of course, you can't really Yeah, but if you make if you just make take a piece of paper
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:33.120]  and measure off 5.5 inches and try to put it on an iPhone seven, it fits. It's not a bad comparison.
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:37.520]  It would you definitely notice it. And I think if the 10R is successful, like, you know, I think
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:41.680]  they might do that. I think it would make sense to offer them in two sizes. Yeah, and that's what I
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:45.360]  would I would I would probably go for that. I mean, eventually, obviously, I can't keep
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:49.840]  keep the sponge for I mean, Caleb says he's gonna do it, but I can't keep this one forever.
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:58.240]  And I feel like it's, you know, iOS 12 has been pretty good on this device, because it actually
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:04.640]  it lives up to the faster it is faster. Like Craig, Craig Federighi said, they're gonna
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:11.120]  make it faster. And they actually seemingly did. Yeah. So I can at least squeeze another year out
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:17.120]  of it if I want to, and don't drop it. But I suspect that when the next version of iOS comes
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:23.040]  out, it's not going to be so friendly. I would, I honestly, I honestly think that anybody holding
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:30.560]  out on it with an SE like you, it would probably be best served to wait one more year, because,
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:35.040]  yeah, if they're going to make a phone smaller than the 10 s, a new one smaller than 10 s,
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:39.440]  it would be next year, and it would be like a I don't know what they would call it, but it
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:44.320]  would effectively be a 10 R mini. Right? That's what I was. Yeah, I was thinking 10 R mini. Yeah,
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:50.320]  it would be exactly the same points as the 10 s just smaller, slightly smaller. Well,
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:55.840]  give me hope again, just so I can get crushed again next year. Well, you know, what's funny,
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:04.080]  what I did is I did yesterday or the day before I fired up my iPhone five s, and wiped it and
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:09.920]  updated it to iOS 12. Because I also bought a pixel three, I bought a pixel two years ago,
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:14.560]  I bought a pixel three, and I want to spend some time using the pixel three as my main phone. But
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:22.480]  I don't want to put my my real SIM card in it. I have like a spare SIM card from T mobile that I
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:27.520]  use with the pixel I had been using with the pixel. And I'll just put that one in my pixel three.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:34.000]  Because I don't want to screw up my iMessage. Joanna Stern had a column about this just a week
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:40.880]  or two ago about how how screwed up it makes everything like she put her SIM card in the pixel
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:49.440]  three to to test it and like missed all sorts of texts from her family and friends because they
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:53.040]  were you know all going to iMessage like she opened up her Mac and then there's all these
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:59.040]  messages that she wasn't getting because they weren't going to SMS. It's just easier. I know
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:05.920]  I'm not going to switch to the pixel three full time. So it's just easier but if I'm going to
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:13.520]  still carry a second phone so I can get my phone calls and text messages and I want to not be
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:20.960]  tempted you know to use it for photos and stuff. I'm just going to carry the five s around for like
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:25.120]  a week while I test the you know in my other pocket while I carry the the pixel three is my
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:30.240]  try to use it for everything fun. And I will say God damn this phone feels nice. The hand
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:35.600]  isn't it? Oh my god. Everyone's really pick up my I have a four upstairs and I picked that up
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:44.240]  and I think God that's a nice feel too. Oh it is just like damn this is nice. And I had to when I
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:50.640]  got the SE as a review unit I never bought an SE but I got the review unit and I've it was funny
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:54.160]  enough I was staying in you know I went to Cupertino I think to get it but I was staying in
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:59.760]  San Francisco and a friend of the show Guy English was in town. I forgot why even though you know
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:04.160]  he's Canadian. He forgot which week he was supposed to be. Yeah I think he forgot what week
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:11.520]  he was supposed to be there so he was in town and we were having a drink at like at a at the hotel
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:17.760]  at like six and I just stood it up. I just stood the phone up. I was like just look at it. It stands
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:22.320]  up. You can just set it on the bottom and it just stands up. Yeah like isn't that nice. I think in
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:28.960]  general I like that. I like the the right angle. The flat edges rather than the curved edges but
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:33.280]  it just it feels like you can it just feels like a phone. It listens to me. It just feels like a
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:37.840]  phone. I hold this and I feel like I could go on like a roller coaster and shoot video and I don't
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:42.320]  have to worry about this phone flying out of my hand. Like nothing is going to make me drop this
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:47.040]  phone. Yeah and you put it in your pocket and it's like oh yeah it doesn't feel like I've got like
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:52.960]  this big thing in my pocket. Well I got the battery replaced in my SE. Oh yeah did you was
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:57.920]  that through the uh the yeah because by the end of the either go prices go back up at the end of
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:02.160]  the year unless they change that uh but so it was only 29 bucks. That's it that's great. Well if I'm
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:05.200]  going to hang on to it I might as well get the battery replaced. And how long did you have to
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:11.440]  wait for that? I remember at first it was like a big well um it took a few days to get the to get
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:16.800]  the appointments any of the appointments were booked out like three or four days.
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:23.200]  You know just a genius appointment was booked out three or four days and so it was just it was just
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:27.200]  a matter of getting a genius appointment and they did it in an hour and a half. All right let me
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:34.000]  take a break here and thank our next sponsor and it's our good friends at RxBar. RxBar makes like
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:41.360]  little pre-packaged food bars and they make them with all natural ingredients. Turns out real food
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:49.040]  is actually tastes really good. RxBars are gluten-free, soy-free and dairy-free. Big deal
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:54.880]  in this Gruber household. For those of you who don't know my son has a dairy allergy so that's
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:17:02.720]  pretty cool. Whether you like sweet or savory, chocolate or full flavors, fruit flavors there's
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:08.480]  definitely an RxBar for you. And they use no artificial colors, no artificial flavors,
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:14.800]  no preservatives, no fillers. It's just real food all stuck together in a bar.
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:22.240]  I love eating bars that's for me because I'll spend I spend I don't even want to time how long
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:26.560]  I spend making coffee every day in the morning. I spend a lot of time making very fussy coffee
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:35.040]  and I have no mental energy left over for preparing anything to eat. A bar for me is perfect.
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:42.640]  I really do. I just you just rip it open and eat it. These RxBars really are very very tasty.
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:48.800]  They taste great. They really do have flavors for everybody and they have a very distinctive
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:54.480]  visual appearance there. You'll notice them on the shelf and they have real food like egg whites for
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:18:03.200]  protein. They use dates to bind, nuts for texture, all sorts of delicious stuff. So easy breakfast
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:08.560]  that you just rip open and eat. Yeah that's honestly I'm gonna admit I'm very lazy. It's
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:13.280]  great though as like a snack in the afternoon. Something you can just keep at your desk,
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:19.040]  keep in your car or something like that. Put them in your backpack. I always keep like a bar in my
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:25.280]  backpack because I always you know you fly on an airplane and it's like it's so much better to
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:30.080]  just have something than wait for the stupid food cart to come along and it's like some kind of
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:34.880]  inedible cookies or something like that that you have to pay for. Terrible. Put a bar in your
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:41.920]  backpack. Then you've always got it and it's also RxBars are really really good for like pre and
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:50.480]  post workout snacks. It's just they're good food and super convenient. They've got 14 delicious
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:55.040]  flavor varieties. I don't know if I can read them all here but I'll try mango pineapple,
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:59.840]  chocolate hazelnut, peanut butter and berries, chocolate sea salt. That's my favorite to be
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:05.840]  honest. I love salty chocolate. Chocolate sea salt is absolutely fantastic. Coconut chocolate,
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:11.520]  mixed berry, blueberry, maple sea salt. I don't think I've had that one yet but I'd like it. I
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:16.640]  like the salty ones. Apple cinnamon, mint chocolate, chocolate chip, peanut butter,
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:22.480]  peanut butter chocolate and coffee chocolate. They also have seasonal flavors too. It's just
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:28.800]  a whole bunch of great stuff and now they have debuted their new RxNut butter which contains a
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:33.280]  few simple similar ingredients like egg whites, fruits and nuts and every single serve packet
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:39.600]  contains delicious creamy nut butter with 9 grams of high quality protein. It's squeezable
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:44.960]  and spreadable and pairs great with fruit, rice cakes, pretzels or just straight out of the pouch
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:50.640]  which admittedly is how I would eat it. Just squeeze it right in my mouth. Their nut butter
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:58.560]  flavors honey, cinnamon, peanut butter, regular peanut butter and vanilla almond butter. These
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:04.720]  things are great. I love them. It's just a great company, great products. There's all sorts of
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:09.840]  these bars you can buy that are effectively just candy bars and maybe you don't feel so good about
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:12.800]  yourself if that's what you eat for breakfast. This is real food. This is real food and you
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:17.280]  don't have to feel the least bit guilty about eating it as like your breakfast or your snack
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:23.520]  or whatever. And they have a fantastic deal. 25% off your first order for listeners of the show.
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:35.280]  Go to our x bar.com slash talk show, just slash talk show at our x bar.com and enter the code
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:42.560]  talk show ta lk sh o w at checkout and that's 25% off your first order. Great product. I love these
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:48.320]  things. I actually need to reorder some. So my thanks to our x bar for sponsoring the show.
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:59.280]  Anything else on the XR? It's kind of funny because it's the RX bar and the iPhone XR.
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:04.640]  Oh, you had mentioned, well, not on the XR, but you were talking about the Pixel 3.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:12.320]  Yeah, I bought one. This is not even a review yet. I bought it because I don't want to buy
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:16.320]  one every year because it's a lot of money, but I feel like it's worth just to stay up to date on
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:21.680]  Android. Right. And they've got this night shift thing coming out? Night sight, they call it.
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:26.160]  Night sight. Okay. I think night shift's a better name. Oh, but that's already taken.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:31.440]  Yeah. That's why I thought it was that. Yeah. So they demoed this on stage at their
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:35.840]  Pixel event and they compared it. It was like a picture of a group of people in a park.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.960]  And they said, here's the same picture taken on an iPhone XS.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:47.440]  And it was shocking how different it was, but it was Google's own photo. And I have to say,
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:57.840]  it's not conspiracy, but Apple is absolutely scrupulous about the example photos they show
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:04.000]  as having been taken with an iPhone. I think Phil Schiller even said on stage during the Apple's
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:12.000]  event that he insists that they literally don't even, not only do they not use like external
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:17.040]  lights, but they don't even use things. I don't even know what they're called, but you know,
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:21.600]  like those things that bounce, you know, they're like, Oh yeah. Yeah. Like a big white piece of
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:26.400]  shiny cardboard and a professional photo shoot. Somebody's holding it up to bounce a little light
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:30.880]  off the bottom. Like they don't use anything like that. You know, I mean, obviously there are using
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:35.280]  professional photographers who are very good at taking photos with whatever camera they use,
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:40.400]  but you know, in terms of, you know, I think the photo that Schiller was talking about was a 10 hour
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:47.200]  photo of like a young, young woman at night leaning on a taxi cab with like a neon sign
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:52.240]  behind her. It was like a, you know, it just, there was some bounce like, and I think the way
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:55.760]  Schiller described it is there was some bounce coming from the hood of the car because she was
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:23:02.080]  leaning on it, but that was actually where she was. So it's, you know, fair game. The pixel three,
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:08.960]  they're, they're talking about the, in Google's example, photos about their second selfie camera.
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:12.720]  You know, it's like super wide angle, like a fish eye lens almost so you can get more of your
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:18.720]  friends in. They have a side by side comparison and supposedly taken at the same spot, but there's
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:23.200]  a guy within the one photo who has like a smokestack over his head. And then in the wider
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:29.200]  angle one, the smokestack is gone. Like, like I don't, you know, it's just showing how wide the
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:32.880]  angle is. And I think it's completely fair representation, but apparently somebody
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:38.240]  photoshopped out a smokestack and the one that's you don't Photoshop, you know, like, ah, we didn't
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:42.640]  think about that smokestack sticking out of the guy's head. Well, let's photoshop it out. Don't
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:48.160]  do that. You can't do that in a, in a photo comparison. You shouldn't do that. So I have
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:53.440]  to say I take Google's example photos with a little bit of a grain of salt, but, but
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:59.920]  this, this nightside feature isn't yet shipping in the pixel three. So you buy a pixel three,
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:03.600]  open it up, update the software. As of this recording, you still don't have it.
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:10.640]  Google says it's coming soon. But it's apparently some, some, you know,
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:16.720]  Android enthusiasts figured out that if you just take the camera app and change one zero to a one,
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:22.960]  it, you know, it's obviously like, yeah, it's obviously like, you know, is nightside on and
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:29.280]  it ships and it says zero and you change it to one and then it's on. So people, you know, and then,
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:34.640]  however, I don't even know what you do, but to, you know, you install the app on your pixel and
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:41.120]  you have this feature. It's rather astounding. Vlad Savov at the verge, I guess I should put this in
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:46.560]  the show notes, had posted an article yesterday with some examples he took and it's really rather
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:52.640]  astounding. Yeah, it is amazing. I mean, the ones on the, you know, the ones without it look like
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:25:00.640]  the shots that I take and then these other ones look like the shots that I wish I could take
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:06.880]  right. Effectively what it's doing. And it takes, you know, it doesn't, it's the part that you think,
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:12.000]  Oh, this is too good to be true. Well, you can't just like open the camera, hit the shutter button
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.200]  and have, you know, this shot in extremely low light limit. You know, we're, we're a traditional
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:23.280]  cam photo with the exact same camera is almost all black with night sight. It almost looks like
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:28.400]  daylight. It's like a tremendous amount, but it, what it does is it takes a few seconds and you
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:31.600]  have to go to a special mode. You have to turn, you know, it's just like when you go to portrait
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:37.040]  mode or panoramic mode or something like that, it's a different mode. And then before you can
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:40.640]  hit the shutter, it's like gathering light. And what it's doing is taking a whole bunch of
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:47.120]  exposures and then it uses all of them together with machine learning to like figure out what the
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:53.280]  heck it's actually doing. So it, you know, the part that's like not magic is it takes a couple
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:59.920]  seconds to get one of these images, but when you do, it's really rather staggering. Yeah.
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:06.560]  I should also put a link in the show notes. Somebody last night texted me a YouTube video
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:10.880]  from some, I believe Chinese, they were definitely Asian. It was an academic paper
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:19.760]  that was published earlier this year in like a machine imaging journal of I don't know if
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:24.480]  they're using the exact same technique as night sight, but it's there. Their example results in
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:31.440]  the paper were very similar, had a very similar look. And the people who wrote this paper also
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:36.720]  published this YouTube video showing examples of their stuff. And they were using like real
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:43.360]  cameras like Sony RX cameras and stuff, but then using this, it's machine learning, take multiple
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:49.040]  exposures, put them through the magic of machine learning and out pops this image. And then they
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:55.360]  also compared it to like the very best high end de-noising algorithms, you know, like, you know,
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:27:00.000]  there's ways, you know, you take a noisy low light photo, there's filters you can use in Photoshop to
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.960]  decrease the noise, but they there's severe, you know, they're very limited. They might make an
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:09.840]  image look better, but they won't make it look like it's not noisy. Whereas this machine learning
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:17.280]  thing gets rid of the noise. It's, it's really astounding. I don't know what else to say about
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:24.960]  it, but it looks just, I mean, it's very impressive. I guess there are people that
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:33.360]  just people I've seen people on Twitter who are upset, annoyed, you know, there's, there's people
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:39.680]  who want the iPhone to be the better camera in every single regard. And, you know, this night
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:45.440]  sight feature is very useful. The iPhone doesn't have it. And, you know, there's and there's other
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:49.600]  people who've used, you know, the pixel two from last year who think that it still takes better
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:55.120]  still photos than like iPhone tennis. It's obviously close, but, but there are specific
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:28:01.600]  features that Google has in their camera app that, that are, you know, it's not, there's no,
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:04.720]  there's no possible way that you can say this night sight feature isn't useful. It's,
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:10.400]  and it's only in the pixel. Yeah. I don't think that's, I don't think it's a reasonable expectation
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:14.480]  to think that Apple would be ahead of Google in every single regard because Google, the Google
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:18.800]  people are, they're just too good at this. They're too good. It means too much to them. It's
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:25.360]  obviously the main selling point of pixel phones. It's just not fair to expect Apple or not
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:30.080]  reasonable to expect Apple to be first in every single regard. I wouldn't be surprised at all
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:34.400]  if Google, if Apple comes out with a very similar feature in a year or two. Right. Right. And I
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:38.560]  don't think most people make decisions like that. Right. No, it doesn't seem like you're not going
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:42.720]  to go out and say, well, I need the absolute. I mean, some people probably do, but I don't
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:45.680]  think most people, I mean, we talked, you know, you talked about Joanna Stern talking about how
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:50.400]  difficult it is to switch platforms for various different reasons. And most people are just going
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:54.640]  to say, well, the camera that I'm going to get in the iPhone 10 S is way better than the camera than
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:59.280]  I have in my eight or whatever you have. So you're going to be pleased that you're getting a better
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:05.360]  camera and you compare it to what you have and not necessarily what's everything that's available.
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:10.640]  Yeah. Jeffrey Fowler, who's now at the Washington post as their tech columnist. I didn't link to his
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:16.400]  review in my review roundup, but I'm, I don't think his post review had them, but on Twitter,
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:22.480]  he posted a bunch of comparison shots that he took from an iPhone six compared to a 10 R.
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:28.320]  And I think in a, you know, I did a bunch of shots just comparing last year's 10 to the 10 S
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:35.040]  and it, it, for most people, what Fowler did comparing it to like an iPhone six is more
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:40.560]  reasonable because that's the phone people are upgrading from now. Right. And it's just staggering
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:43.520]  how much better it is at low light. All of these cameras are going to be better than the one in my
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:49.760]  SE. Well, you know what the SE has a six S class camera, right? Yeah. Still, I mean, like, you know,
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:55.040]  with all the modern ones in any of these new phones are going to be better than what I have.
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:30:00.720]  Yeah. It's really staggering. I guess it's, I should mention this too, because it was something
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:07.440]  people emailed to me about or a followup. I forgot talking to Frommer about the pixels last week. I
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:13.120]  mentioned that Google also has this picture, this feature, um, forget what they call it, but
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:17.760]  effectively when you tap on a subject in the display, you know, you're using the camera
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:24.080]  and there's, you got a cat and you tap on the cat to focus on the cat. As the cat moves around,
[01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:31.120]  it continues. It keeps the focus square on that cat or whatever it is that you focused on. You
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:36.080]  know, it uses it again, machine learning to identify, Oh, here's the thing. And it's,
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:42.800]  you know, it's, it's, it's moving. We'll keep, we'll keep the focus on it. Um, it's really cool.
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:46.720]  I have, again, I have a pixel three in the house, but I haven't even opened the box yet.
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:51.920]  Cause I've been waiting to finish all of my XR or 10 hour stuff and to do the show and everything.
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:56.960]  So I'll open it this weekend. Um, but just using the hands-on units at the Google event press
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:03.040]  event two weeks ago, it it's really cool. I, the thing I want to mention is that apparently some
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:08.320]  higher end dedicated cameras have had a similar feature for a while. I don't think an SLR could
[01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:13.920]  do it cause of the way SLRs actually have to have the mirror flip up. But some of the mirrorless
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:19.360]  cameras of recent years have a similar feature. I don't know how well that works. My Fuji,
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:24.960]  my, you know, most recent real quote unquote real camera. I own my Fuji X 100 S doesn't have that.
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:28.960]  Somebody even said, Fuji is somebody actually even mentioned, I think who knows I have a Fuji
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:34.320]  like Fuji, all the good things you can say about their cameras are actually behind on this feature.
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:38.880]  Um, I think part of it is that my Fuji doesn't have a touch screen. It just has like
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:43.600]  an old fashioned non touch screen display. It kind of makes sense that you'd have to
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:47.760]  have a touch screen for this to pick a subject. Right. Um, I don't know how well,
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:53.280]  unless you're gonna have a mouse. So how similar the Google's implementation of this is to the
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:57.040]  implementation in Sony cameras and whatever else, whoever else has them, I don't know,
[01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:00.880]  but it's a really cool feature. And whether they're the first camera to have it or not,
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:05.760]  they're certainly the first cell phone camera to have it. It's a very cool feature. The other
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:10.800]  thing they have that, and again, I talked about it with Dan last week, but I should mention it
[01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:17.040]  cause people have written to me about it is they have this picture called top photo. I forget
[01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:23.200]  their marketing name, but the gist of it is I take a picture of you and the moment I hit this
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:28.640]  shutter, you, you're like looking away or your eyes are closed. You blinked and it tries to
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:35.200]  identify those moments like, Ooh, I see this as a human face and the eyes are closed. Luckily,
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:42.000]  I've captured three frames from the second before and a few from the after and who here's one where
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.520]  his eyes are wide open and he's looking right at the camera. I'll pop up and say, Hey, would you
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:53.920]  prefer to use this image rather than that image? And some people have said, well, doesn't Apple
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:59.760]  have a similar feature? Like when you take a burst mode or like when you take a burst mode, it puts a
[01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:05.440]  dot under some of them. Like when you go to examine it and it sort of guesses, you know,
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:12.160]  based on similar AI type features, like shoot burst mode and you get 20 still images and then
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:16.080]  you go to examine them and you know, there's a nice little interface and it shows them all.
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:22.640]  And iOS helpfully puts like a dot under some of them like to suggest, Hey, this one might be good
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:29.120]  and that's cool. And it does work to some regard, but with the Google feature, it, it, you don't
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:34.240]  have to go into a mode and you don't have to shoot a burst. And if it, in most of the photos you take,
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:39.440]  it doesn't do anything because it doesn't trigger the, Hey, this could be better if you take the one
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:46.640]  from a second ago, right? The Google thing is it's, I don't know. I just, like I said,
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:52.320]  a few minutes ago, there's some people who are so that suffer so much consternation worried that,
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:56.400]  that this can't meet be true, that Google has better features on the camera than the iPhone.
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:01.520]  This is one that it is. It's the, whatever, whatever Apple is doing with the burst mode,
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:08.400]  doesn't compare to the top photo picture on the pixels. And it was so funny because in the hands
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:14.000]  on area, while the woman from Google's camera team was explaining the feature to me and I,
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:18.560]  they'd already given me a pixel three to just hold while she was talking, I took a picture of her
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:22.960]  and it literally captured her with her eyes closed. And like, as I said this last week,
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:26.160]  but it just blows my mind that as she's telling me how the feature works,
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:30.000]  I took a photo that triggered it and it said, would you rather use this photo? And the photo
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:36.960]  it suggested she looked perfect. It was absolutely crazy. And then I'm like, what? This would be
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:39.680]  annoying if it happened all the time. And I started taking more pictures and it never
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:43.920]  happened again. Cause they were all the, you know, people without their eyes closed. Yeah.
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:48.960]  Yeah. And of course these are all just on the pixel, right? This, this, those two features.
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:53.040]  I believe so. Yes. Well, but they are coming. Most of those features that were coming to the
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:57.600]  previous pixels to the pixel one and pixel two. And I know that the night night side definitely
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:02.080]  Samsung's not getting right. Samsung's not getting them. It's a Google photo, Google feature,
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:12.720]  which is its own can of worms. The verge had an interesting story. I thought it was funny
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:18.160]  cause I had written a post last week about something that was just like a shameless ripoff
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:25.440]  of the iPhone in another bird story. I forget if it was a Huawei thing or who, but then the very
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:32.000]  next day, obviously long in the works, the verge had a long feature story from I think Sam Byford,
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:40.960]  who actually found it fascinating, like really digging into the Chinese phone company's
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:48.080]  OSS. And I really, he's making the gist of his thing is don't think of them as skins anymore.
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:51.920]  You know, like the old days, you know, all these Android handset makers would put their own UI
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:56.720]  skin on top of Android to give everything their, you know, just like, you know, their own look.
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:04.960]  But like Xiaomi and Huawei and LG, they all have their own, they even call them OSS, you know, like
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:11.360]  MI UI, OSS and stuff. And it really is more thinking of them as their own OSS sort of based
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:19.760]  on Android. But part of it is fully acknowledging that it's just completely standard amongst all of
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:25.600]  them to just utterly shamelessly copy the iOS camera app. I mean, they copy all sorts of things
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:32.000]  from iOS. They copy icons. I think it was an icon. It was, it was like the music icon was like an
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:38.640]  exact, it was like, they just turned the gradient upside down. And, and their, their health app was
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:45.280]  just the Apple health app icon with like an EKG line underneath the heart, like a white background
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:50.640]  and a pink heart with a gradient. And it was even the same shape heart, you know, like, there's like
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:58.000]  10 different ways to draw a heart. It's just a total copy. But the phone in particular, the
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:03.600]  camera app of Apple's iOS seven camera app, like is the gist of what Byford wrote is might be the
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:08.240]  most influential software design of the last 10 years. Like they copy all sorts of things from
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:14.320]  Apple, but the camera app in particular is just amazing. I thought that was it. I guess I should
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:25.520]  put that in the show notes. I'm the show notes are going to be long. Chinese OSS. All right,
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:33.200]  whatever. Anything else on the tower? I'm trying to think about this. The case thing is weird.
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:39.280]  The fact that Apple doesn't have cases. And I know that is odd. I can't help but think it's it,
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:43.840]  going back to what we were talking about earlier in the show about how could they have been ready
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:47.680]  or were they purposefully not ready? I don't know the fact that they don't even have cases yet makes
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:52.480]  me think that some of this was a bit rushed on Apple's part. I just it's such an unusual thing
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:59.360]  not to ship. There was a rumor nine to five Mac figured out that like, not even a rumor there were
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:05.120]  there were versions of the PR releases on September 12, about the new phones in other
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:10.720]  countries that like it was like Apple Canada sent out a thing that said that the 10 are would have
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:17.680]  an Apple clear case. And it seems like what happened was that there was some original plan
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:22.480]  for Apple to ship a clear case for the iPhone 10 or which makes sense because you know, if you're
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:27.920]  going to buy these colorful phones, right? Why put them in an opaque case? You know, if you have a
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:30.560]  cool blue phone, that was one of the reasons that was one of the things I was thinking what maybe
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:35.520]  why they don't ship with the cases they want you to put a case on it, but maybe. And if you remember
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:42.560]  with the with the last colorful iPhones, the five C, the Apple cases had holes in the back. Yeah,
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:50.480]  yeah. To show the color through right. I hated those. It was weird, but you kind of got the
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:55.120]  thinking I never liked like this. And I liked I love those phones. I never I never had one. But I
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:59.040]  you know, every time I picked one up, I always just it's it was plastic, but it felt really good.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.320]  Isn't that what Johnny? Johnny? I've said in the video, it's like unapologetically plastic.
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:10.160]  But it sounds like bullshit, but it was true if they were it was unapologetically plastic,
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:15.600]  and it was really nice. I did not have one either because I got the five s instead,
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:21.440]  which is actually in my hand as I speak. But it was really nice. You know why I saw a lot of
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:29.600]  people with five C's it was at Apple, like actual Apple employees and Cupertino. I forget why I was
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:39.680]  there. It was some subsequent event and or product briefing or something and I was at Infinite Loop
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:46.560]  and having lunch in the cafe max. I forget who with but so I just got you know, I was it was
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:51.600]  just very rare. You know, it's unusual for Apple to invite members of the media to like stay stay
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:57.120]  for lunch. And I just remember watching like Apple employees walk around and an awful lot of them had
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:00.400]  the five C, you know, and you would think, oh, Apple employees would have the best they'd have
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:05.360]  the five. Nice. But I think I think just the fact that it was sort of fun, you know, there's an
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:09.280]  awful lot of people at Apple who were more interested in the fun aspect of Apple products
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:14.640]  than the technical bleeding edge aspect of Apple products. I just thought that was really
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:19.440]  interesting. You know, you just eyeballing it roughly at lunch without being a creep.
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:25.120]  You know, but it was the thing about the five C's is it was obvious it was a fight. If it didn't
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:29.200]  have a case, it was very obvious, you know, because it looked like no other phone on the market,
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:35.200]  let alone your iPhone. Yeah. So I mean, so is is your Do you wonder if maybe that they
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:40.000]  they couldn't get? I think they tried to make a bunch of clear cases, and they didn't work out
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.720]  for Yeah, I don't know. Or they're coming soon. You know, I'll bet they're coming soon. But it's,
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:48.240]  I would think they would. Yeah, they eventually they have to ship something. Yeah. Leaving money
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:41:00.400]  on the table. Yeah, I bought one from a company called total, totally to ta, l l e. But a couple
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:07.360]  cases from them actually, I guess again, here is another link in the show notes. There are I'm not
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:15.520]  a case person. I've never been. I've used my iPhones without a case almost all the time. Every
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:22.560]  once in a while, though, I kind of want to have a case. Like on vacation, like, you know, go like in
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:29.760]  the summertime, I tend to have sweaty hands and hot weather, hot weather. And the modern the glass,
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:33.840]  you know, all the modern iPhones get a little slippery if your hands are wet, in my opinion.
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:40.560]  So I would like to take I would like to I like to keep a case in my backpack. And then just if I
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:44.480]  feel like my phone is slippery, I like to, you know, I'm on vacation, maybe I'll put it in a
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:51.360]  case for the day because then it won't be slippery. But I'm generally not a case person. So maybe I
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:58.080]  shouldn't be writing reviews of iPhone cases. But anyway, it's overwhelming. There are I just read
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:03.440]  a thing the other day about like, it's literally like a billion dollar industry selling phone
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:11.280]  accessories, you know, and I would guess easily. I think 95% of people put their iPhones in cases,
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:16.320]  maybe more. I Yeah, very, very rare when you don't see somebody with an iPhone case.
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:21.040]  Yeah, I think, I mean, you know, once you drop and break this,
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:28.320]  break it. You're a little gun shy after that. I think people who've never broken it do it just
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:31.920]  I think people are so worried about breaking I can't imagine there's nobody left who hasn't
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:37.040]  broken. You know, I've always won. So I've I was just telling so I've so I've never really
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:41.680]  used the case. And I've had every you know, I've been using an iPhone since day one,
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:49.600]  I've only ever cracked the screen on two. And both were the iPhone six, not the six s the six
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:55.360]  specifically, which I thought was the there was something with the aluminum that it was slippery
[01:42:55.360 --> 01:43:03.760]  as hell. So I dropped my six I forget how many months in on a sidewalk. And it was just it was
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:08.560]  like, I didn't even have to check. It was like, it was like, oh, that shattered screen like that.
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:14.240]  And then it and I, you know, went to the Apple store and got it fixed. It was only like 100
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:19.360]  bucks. I don't know. It was very reasonable. And I just checked the prices. I think it's still only
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:27.520]  like 129 bucks for like the iPhone six s or seven or something like that. The iPhone 10s,
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:32.240]  though, are very expensive. They're like 300 bucks to replace the screen. So yeah, maybe I should
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:37.360]  put a case on that. I also never buy Apple Care. I haven't bought Apple Care for any product since
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:43.360]  the the only the only Apple product I've ever bought Apple Care for my life was my Mac LC that
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:48.800]  I bought. Again, to reference earlier in the show in 1991. When I went to college, I haven't bought
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:56.880]  Apple Care since for anything. And I'm way ahead. So if I ever get a lemon that dies a day after
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:04.080]  the the one year warranty expires, and I have to buy a new one, whatever it is, I'm still ahead.
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:11.040]  I've saved 1000s of dollars in the last 20. What would it be 27 years? I've saved a lot of money
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:15.920]  by never buying Apple Care. But on the other hand, I like to I like to play blackjack too.
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:23.680]  Yeah, really. I wouldn't take this as advice. I did not I did not get it on this SE. I don't know
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:30.160]  why I didn't. I just but I dropped I saw I dropped that six and it cracked the screen and I got it
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:34.000]  fixed. And I thought, you know what, I've been thinking this goddamn phone is slippery. I got
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:37.920]  to be careful. And then like a couple of weeks later, I wanted to take a picture of something
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:43.200]  in a store. And I held it up. And it wasn't like taking it out of my pocket. And I just held it up
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:47.520]  to take a picture of like a shirt in a store. And the phone just slipped right through my fingers.
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:52.480]  And the store had carpeting even it wasn't like a hard floor. And I didn't even think for a second
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:57.120]  that the screen would have broken and I picked it up. And it was like the worst break I've ever seen
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:04.160]  like completely unusable. Like, you couldn't even like, hope to get, you know, to read what was on
[01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:09.120]  carpeting. Yeah. But like, it wasn't like shag carpet, though. Yeah, yeah, right. But it was just
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:13.600]  it was that Yeah, right. And so I had to get fixed. It was the same phone. So the same phone,
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:19.440]  my iPhone six, I had to get the screen replaced twice. But all other phones combined since 2007.
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:25.920]  It's not not a single cracked screen. So I don't know, maybe I'm lucky. Maybe I'm careful,
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:31.200]  whatever. I'm not a case person. But I remember we were at we were at the fair,
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:34.480]  stand in the line, stand in the long line to do one of the rides. And thanks.
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:41.920]  Hank's iPhone had had the battery drained. And so he's like, can I play with your iPhone? I was like,
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:48.640]  Hmm, okay. I think it was a six as well. And I was like, but don't drop it. First, like,
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:55.680]  less than a minute later, smash. And you didn't have a case. Really?
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:00.400]  There's no Yeah, I didn't have a case. So anyway, what I'm trying to say is,
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:04.080]  there's a million cases out there, literally. I mean, there's like a million different companies,
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:10.240]  and it's overwhelming. And so I did what any sane person would do is I just went to the wire cutter.
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:16.480]  And like, they, of course, had like, best cases, best iPhone cases of 2018. I just I don't know
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:21.120]  what we would do without the wire cutter. Like, like, honestly, the why I guess they dropped the
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:24.560]  I wish they hadn't because I think that was a better name. But now they're just wire cutter.
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:32.320]  But they have such good roundups of things like this. And they break their cases into such
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:38.880]  sensible categories, like super protective cases, you know, like the Otterbox style things that are
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:42.880]  like, you know, you can like put it on a rink and hockey game and use it as the puck and it'll
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:50.800]  survive. And super Karen gets super thin cases. And, you know, there's all sorts of, you know,
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:57.120]  any way you'd want to separate it, you know, best leather case if you want to do it. And so I just
[01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:02.320]  went to their thing. And it was like best thin case for iPhones. And they recommended this brand
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:09.040]  total Lee to ta ll e. Like I mentioned this on a slack that you and I are both on and somebody was
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:13.120]  like, I can't believe you bought a phone from a company with that name. And it was true. I saw
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:18.720]  the name of the company. And I was just like, I'm not buying from these people. But they don't print
[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:23.440]  the name on the terrible name. They don't print the name on the cases. Even in small print,
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:29.440]  the cases are completely on logoed that they are expensive. They're like $25 cases at Amazon,
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:36.320]  which makes me I'm an idiot. I there's so many like $8 cases I see. Oh, these are 25 or $26.
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:42.400]  They must be good. And I think well, I can justify this. I can justify buying three of these. It's
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:48.240]  for work. And I bought like three of these cases that I have no intention of actually using.
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:56.080]  I bought ones for the 10 are which I'm going to send back to Apple. But I just feel like without
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:00.720]  Apple branded cases, it might be helpful for me to say, Hey, here's some good ones. But I bought
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:08.640]  total Lee's clear case for the 10 are and it's nice. It is I can't help but think that clear
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:16.400]  cases are going to be a big thing. Oh, yeah, for the 10 are Yeah, it definitely is clear they the
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:22.640]  total Lee people claim that their clear case doesn't yellow over time and it doesn't crack.
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:27.280]  Apparently, that's a problem with a lot of clear cases. So I will put a link to the show note,
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:33.440]  I guess I'll link to the Amazon page. I can't verify that it won't yellow after a year.
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:40.080]  Because I've had it for a couple days. But it has a nice feel. It is grippy. It increases the grip.
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:48.000]  I feel like it is a nice amount of grippiness without being tacky coming out of your pocket.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:52.480]  You know, I feel like there's a fine line there. I actually feel like Apple's polyurethane or
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:59.440]  whatever they call their plastic rubbery cases are a little too frictiony coming out of a jeans
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:05.040]  pocket. My son swears by them, though. He loves the Apple rubber cases, whatever they call them.
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:11.680]  So it's but it's, you know, it's nice. And it's truly clear. It is not yellow at all. And it
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:20.400]  really does. Hank has a red leather case for his 7S. It's actually one of the first ones that he
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:25.040]  keeps on like most of the time. I mean, he used to have plastic ones, because I would always just
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:31.600]  get him the cheapest one on Amazon. And he would constantly be just like taking it. He didn't like
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:35.920]  having that on and he would take it off all the time. And then he'd drop it. I was like,
[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:39.840]  you have a case, leave it in the case. And this is the first one where I haven't had to argue
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:43.760]  with him about it. He seems seemingly likes the letter. Yeah, well, that's the other thing.
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:49.360]  Apple's cases are really good. And it's weird, I guess because they are relatively expensive,
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:54.640]  you know, compared to third party cases. That's why people don't buy them because it also seems
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:59.920]  to me like eyeballing it at airports or wherever I go where I just my mind wanders and I start
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:06.720]  looking like who's using an iPhone without a case? Nobody, just me. But I also noticed that
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:12.560]  nobody uses Apple cases. But I think the Apple cases are by far the nicest they had one other
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:16.400]  I had one of the leather cases for something I can't remember what it was. I think it was the six
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:21.680]  but and I have it like a knockoff one for my se and the only reason I actually have it in a case
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:29.680]  I would probably go without it. But my car mount is a magnetic mount. And so if I want to put it on
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:33.760]  that I have to have that plate in there and I'm not gonna like I'm not gonna attach it to the
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:38.880]  iPhone for sure. Yeah, my favorite cases by far the leather Apple leather cases. Jonas does not
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:43.920]  like them though. He likes the rubber ones. He genuinely prefers it. But the Apple leather cases
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:49.600]  are so perfect. I mean, they're Yeah, if you want some combination of I mean, they're obviously not
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:54.000]  the thinnest but it's you know, it's obviously like a middle ground between being pretty protective
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:51:00.960]  compared to no case at all. Not like one of these. You know, once it's almost like a sticker,
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:06.880]  you know, but I like that. I bought some of these for my tennis from totally that are so they're so
[01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:13.920]  thin that that the camera bump still sticks out. That's how thin they're like one of the nice
[01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:18.560]  things about a case and I actually think it not to ramble all over the place. But I actually think
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:24.720]  you know, we I used to bitch about camera bumps when Apple first introduced it with the iPhone six
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:28.480]  it's like what is this bump? Why? You know, this is terrible. It feels like a pimple on the back
[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:35.760]  of the phone and it's you know, I'm used to it now. And but I also feel like one of the reasons
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:43.280]  Apple has these bumps and is accepted that there's going to be a significant ever bigger camera bump
[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:48.480]  on all these iPhones going forward is that most people never notice because they use a case and
[01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:53.360]  with the case with almost every case the bump you know that the case is thicker than the camera bump
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:59.520]  so you don't notice it. Whereas these super thin cases from totally the clear one is not super
[01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:05.200]  thin. The clear one is like the sort of regular rubbery thickness. But they've got these super
[01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:14.400]  thin ones that are that the camera bump still sticks out. Anyway, anyway, the leather I think
[01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:18.720]  the Apple leather ones are so nice. And to me, one of the things about it is that when you press the
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:23.680]  buttons like the volume and the power button, it doesn't feel like you're pressing a button that is
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:27.520]  pressing a button. It just feels like you're pressing a button. Yeah, well, it's just a bump,
[01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:31.440]  right? I mean, this one, I think as a knockoff does it the same way as the real one. Right.
[01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:37.840]  Yeah, the only thing that to me, the only thing that really, really I always annoys me on using
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:44.400]  the case of any sort is the getting the volume toggle or the mute toggle the mute thing. Yeah,
[01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:49.920]  yeah. I never I never turn off mute. That's the I've mentioned this before. And that's what other
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:53.280]  people tell me. Other people are like, you turn your phone off mute. And it's like, yeah, sometimes
[01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:59.200]  I do. I never do. I still think it's the weirdest thing that that's not copied by Android makers.
[01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:06.560]  The weirdest thing to me, I love having a mute button. I think I used to use it. But I just do
[01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:13.120]  not. I do. But it's, I mean, particularly because I'm with the watch. Now I just look at my watch.
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:18.560]  I know when I'm getting a call. It's not like when I still have it on vibrate. I think it's
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:22.880]  just crazy that Android makers don't copy that from the iPhone. I don't know why. Maybe I'm
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:27.600]  just you might be the only one using the only one you use. It's like me and Johnny. I've
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:34.640]  even Johnny. All right, anything else on the iPhone front? I can't think of anything. No.
[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:42.240]  What else do we have here? I guess I can thank our third and final sponsor before we continue on
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:48.240]  and talk about next week's event. And our third and final sponsor is from an up and coming startup
[01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:55.280]  called Amazon. And apparently this Amazon company has a bunch of
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:59.840]  they're sort of a large company. It's very surprising when you research it.
[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:07.280]  Well, one of their services is called prime video. And here's the deal. When you're a member of
[01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:11.040]  Amazon Prime, I'll drop the joke. You know what Amazon Prime is you give them you sign up and
[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:14.960]  then you get the main thing it all started, you get free shipping, you sign up for Amazon Prime.
[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:18.560]  And then when you buy anything on Amazon, you don't pay for shipping, it just all shows up
[01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:24.880]  for free. I don't know how that works. Because I get hundreds of packages a year. And somehow,
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:28.240]  you know, the cost of shipping all that has to be more than what I pay in Amazon Prime.
[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:36.240]  Well, the other thing you get with Amazon Prime in recent years is you get Prime video. And if
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:41.440]  you have prime and prime video, you can sign up for a subscription to what they call prime
[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:49.520]  video channels. And when you do this, you get access. This is for cord cutters. In other words,
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:56.320]  cable TV, super expensive. It's like $10,000 a month for cable TV. And what do you get with
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:55:00.960]  cable TV, you get hundreds of channels that you don't even watch? Well, with prime video channels,
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:06.800]  you get real channels. This isn't, you know, you get all of their regular original content from
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:11.520]  Amazon Prime, all the shows and movies and stuff that you get from the regular prime video, you
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:14.960]  all you already get that this is on top of that you sign up for a subscription subscription to
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:20.240]  prime video channels. And you can pick the channels you want. And then you pay based on
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:26.000]  what you pick. They have over 100 of these and they're real channels, Showtime stars, HBO,
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:33.920]  Cinemax, CBS all access, plus a ton of specialty channels, British TV, fitness stuff, all sorts of
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:40.960]  sports horror, the whole channels dedicated just to horror perfect for Halloween. And you can watch
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:46.240]  them anywhere that you watch prime. So you go to Amazon's website and sign up for this. And you can
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:51.680]  get a free all of these channels come with like a seven day free trial. So you don't even pay for
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:57.840]  seven days. You can sign up, add the channels you want, see how it works. But they work everywhere
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:02.720]  that prime video works. So I you know, I do it on my Apple TV, because that's what's connected to my
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:07.520]  TV. But you know, you get the app, I swear to God, they're the notes they gave me. I they say
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:13.920]  there's 650 different devices that you can watch this on. I mean, every that's got to be like all
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:19.280]  the hundreds of Android phones, I don't know. But any iPhone, iPad, anything that you can get prime
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:24.080]  video on. You can if you if you sign up for prime video channels, you can watch the prime video
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:29.520]  channels there. So you can watch HBO on your phone, on your iPad, on anything and you don't
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:35.760]  have to get this is the thing. You don't have to get all these different apps like a Showtime app
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:41.680]  and an HBO app and CBS all access app and all of that. And then every time you know, like to use
[01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:47.520]  those apps, you go and then you have to sign in to your cable account. And it always, you know,
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:53.360]  times out after a couple of weeks and two, this is all through the prime video app. So it's one
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:58.000]  app, you sign up for the subscription. And all these channels are just there in the prime video
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:02.480]  app on all of your different devices. So everything on HBO, you can watch all the old
[01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:08.320]  episodes of Game of Thrones, you can watch one of my favorite HBO shows the john Oliver this week,
[01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:12.560]  tonight, last week tonight. I love that show. God, I love that show. If you're interested in
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:18.480]  current events at all, and like a daily show type show, john Oliver's last week tonight is like it
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:25.520]  is like one of the few shows that our whole family is like religiously attuned to. And we like it.
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:32.160]  We drop into like a group depression when he takes weeks off, you get it for free. Well, not free,
[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:38.560]  but you get it when you sign up for HBO through the prime video channels. It really is. It's
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:43.520]  really is. It's terrific. It is absolutely a terrific service. If you don't have cable,
[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:47.760]  or you'd like to get rid of cable. It is a terrific way to watch channels that traditionally
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:54.240]  you had to get through cable. And like I said, you create your own TV lineup based on the ones
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:59.600]  that you want to watch. And you like if you don't like sports, you don't sign up for the sports
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:04.560]  channels. That's it. Whereas opposed to cable TV. Guess what you're paying, you know, like 10 bucks
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:11.600]  a month for ESPN, whether you watch sports or not, which is crazy. All channels start with a free
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:18.160]  trial, get a seven day free trial of any of the channels that you haven't tried yet. It just
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:22.560]  couldn't be better. And then you sign up for one of these channels, you don't like it, just turn it
[01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:27.920]  off before the seven days are up and you don't pay for it. It's really great. Watch them anywhere,
[01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:32.480]  anytime, any device, it sounds too good to be true. But honest to God, this is like the future
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:38.640]  of watching TV channels. It's just terrific. I watch on Apple TV, but they have their own fire
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:44.960]  TV box, the rock you anything, all these smart TVs today, you can't buy a TV that doesn't come
[01:58:44.960 --> 01:58:50.560]  with the Amazon Prime thing built in. So all sorts of good shows that CBS all access I've been meaning
[01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:55.920]  to watch their new Star Trek discovery thing. I've been I do this thing in recent years where
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:59.120]  I don't want to watch a show the first year because I'm afraid I'll get into it and then
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:04.160]  they'll cancel out. But apparently, they have a lot invested in that one. So I think you're
[01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:12.080]  but I skipped I want to watch it. I like Star Trek shows. I just I wanted to wait and see if
[01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:17.280]  see if there'd be more than a year. So anyway, I want to get the CBS all access just for that.
[01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:24.400]  It's really great. So if you're already a prime member, you can just sign up and add this.
[01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:29.680]  If you're not a prime member and you use Amazon, you should be. It's really if you're going to shop
[01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:35.680]  at Amazon, you might as well have prime. It's just really great. So here's a special offer
[01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:41.200]  for listeners of the show. Only pay for the channels you want with Amazon Prime channels.
[01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:50.480]  Start your free trial of over 100 channels by visiting try prime channels.com slash talk show.
[01:59:50.480 --> 02:00:01.440]  That's try prime channels.com slash talk show. And you can start them all with free trial.
[02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:07.280]  My thanks to Amazon Prime channels for sponsoring the show. Very cool. All right,
[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:13.760]  next week's event. Let's let's let's figure this out. Okay. Well, I think the surprise thing we
[02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:21.120]  can start with that is that Ming-Chu Kuo says there'll be a new iPad mini, but not next week,
[02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:25.040]  or he does say there's gonna be next week. I thought maybe maybe I'm wrong about that.
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:30.560]  I thought that he said, I thought he said that it's in the works, but it's early 2019.
[02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:36.240]  Oh, okay. Okay. I don't think it's next week. And I, you know, it would, it would in theory
[02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:40.720]  be aligned with if they do like a one year revolution of the regular iPads to like,
[02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:45.760]  if they do like a March or April event. But anyway, I think just any sign of life that
[02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:51.040]  the iPad mini is not dead is news because the mini was something that maybe wasn't updated
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:55.840]  every year, but it was updated most years until all of a sudden it wasn't updated at all.
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:01:04.000]  And I loved talking, you know, again, tying to something we talked an hour ago about my
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:08.720]  declining eyesight. I loved the iPad mini when it came out, loved it. I was like, I would never
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:14.000]  buy a big iPad. That thing is huge. I'd used an iPad mini for everything. And now I feel like
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:19.840]  it's too small. Like I can't, I never took to it. I mean, I use them a little while for writing
[02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:26.320]  books and writing, I mean, reading books. But, but I, you know, for like gaming and watching
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:32.480]  TV shows and stuff like that, I'd rather have in writing. I'd rather have the big one. Yeah. And
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:36.720]  that's the other thing for me that I do a lot more of than I did six, seven, eight years ago is I
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:44.400]  watch a lot more TV on my iPad, especially baseball. And baseball in particular, just
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:49.680]  because the balls, you know, kind of little, having a bigger screen, you can actually see
[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:54.560]  a little bit more like, yeah, like in a pinch, I'll watch it on my phone. But it's really,
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:58.640]  it's almost like watching baseball on a phone is almost like, Oh, yeah, listening to baseball.
[02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:05.200]  So yeah, for watching stuff, I like the bigger one. But still, I know there are fans of the
[02:02:05.200 --> 02:02:12.480]  iPad mini. And, you know, I, I'd like to think that it sells enough that it's not going to be
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:19.040]  dropped. So that's cool. But who knows? Yeah, I don't think it's coming next week. I was surprised
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:23.040]  I was sort of I couldn't really figure out exactly why they would get rid of it. But I mean,
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:27.120]  just the I mean, I guess because the phones are getting bigger, they're approaching that size,
[02:02:27.120 --> 02:02:31.280]  but they're not there yet. And no, there's enough people who still like that device that
[02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:37.840]  it's worth making one. Yeah. And I did that I actually dug my iPad mini. The one that I own
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:43.840]  is actually an iPad mini two, which I think is also it's a five s class device in terms of I
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:52.080]  think the same a seven processor. It's it is totally it's I don't think I think the idea that
[02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:59.440]  a big ass 6.5 inch tennis Max is the you know, there's no need for iPad mini anymore. The iPad
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:03.760]  mini is so much bigger than a tennis Max. It's ridiculous. Like you can't put an iPad mini in
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:09.520]  your pants pocket. Well, I could barely put a tennis Max in my pants pocket. But still, yes.
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:18.800]  Anyway, the rumors are the iPad pros seem like a lock for next week. Yeah. It seems like that
[02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:23.200]  bet the bet the bet the house on that. Because they haven't been updated for an entire generation.
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:28.160]  There were no a 11. Well, who knows, maybe these will have a 11. But I would guess they'll have a
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:34.160]  12. But there was no you know, that the current iPad pros are all a 10 devices haven't been
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:40.320]  updated in a while. Supposedly, you know, and shocker, I don't think you'd even need to follow
[02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:44.800]  the rumors. I think you just need to look at what Apple is doing with iPhones. And you know, the
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:49.600]  idea that the screens will go more corner to corner and have rounded edges at the corners.
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:58.960]  The other and face ID instead of face ID instead of touch ID. And I forget if it was Steven
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:07.440]  Trotton Smith or Guillermo Rambo, or both of them, who poking about iOS 12.1 betas concluded that
[02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:13.760]  the camera would work in both landscape and portrait, which the iPhone camera or face ID
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:19.200]  still doesn't. But that you would think that would, you know, maybe that's not important
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:25.040]  for the iPhone, because when you're unlocking it, it's always in portrait, and whereas iPads are
[02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:31.120]  equally used both ways. Right, right. So it would really suck if it didn't work both ways. Yeah.
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:39.840]  Hopefully, that would be cool. And the one that to me is more interesting, most interesting,
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:46.800]  is supposedly they're switching to USB C instead of lightning. Yeah. Which in turn would also
[02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:51.200]  mean that I guess you wouldn't, they'll need to make a new Apple pencil, because the Apple
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:57.120]  pencil charges by sticking it into the lightning port on your iPad Pro. But that kind of sucks. If
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:05:03.760]  you're like, let's say you're, let's say you're a big iPad Pro user, and you have an Apple pencil,
[02:05:03.760 --> 02:05:07.040]  it kind of sucks that you've got to spend another 100 bucks on an Apple pencil just so you can
[02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:14.320]  charge it. Right with the iPad. I mean, I guess you could just not pencil pencil dongle. Right.
[02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:19.280]  Right. Well, there's a pencil dongle, though, so that you can charge it into the, you know,
[02:05:20.080 --> 02:05:24.000]  the, you know, there's, there is a little dongle that ships with the pencil that lets you use the,
[02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:28.720]  turns it into a female lighting connector instead of a male lightning connector.
[02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:33.760]  Yeah. But anyway, presumably, if the iPad is USB C, then the pencil would have to be USB C.
[02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:40.240]  Supposedly, new MacBooks. But this is the part that to me is the most exciting,
[02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:44.400]  is that nobody really knows what the hell is going on with the MacBooks. Yeah, there's, you know,
[02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:50.160]  Gurman, we've seen, and it's reported that there's a supposedly lower cost MacBook Air replacement
[02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:54.160]  with a retina screen. But there's really no deep even from Gurman, there's no details.
[02:05:55.760 --> 02:06:03.520]  And is it just one? Is it? You know, who knows? I think it's terribly exciting and and is a knock
[02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:12.400]  on wood on Friday, the what the hell's today's date? 28th? 29th? 26th. 26th. Have I mentioned my
[02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:22.400]  eyes? I say this. No leaks about what the hell is coming up with MacBooks. I mean, very, very
[02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:27.520]  exciting. And the event is in New York and at the Brooklyn Academy. Yeah, way better for you,
[02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:33.600]  right? Yeah, way better for me. Yeah. I mean, I don't even hate flying, but it's sure as hell.
[02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:40.480]  $61 Amtrak train that takes 80 minutes and leaves from a train station I'm 10 minutes away from is
[02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:49.840]  awful lot better than a transcontinental flight. I'm terribly excited about that. Yeah, this it
[02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:56.960]  feels downright luxurious. What else? I don't know. So you mentioned the MacBook,
[02:06:56.960 --> 02:07:05.760]  but then also like Mac Mini and new iMac. Yeah. Yeah. So the iMac, I just looked up the regular
[02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:11.360]  non pro iMacs are over 500 days since the last update. And you know, I think I tweeted about
[02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:15.600]  this and somebody was like, well, you know, guess what, that's that's the way Apple rolls these days.
[02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:21.200]  But the iMac, however much you want to criticize Apple for letting certain products in the Mac
[02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:28.400]  lineup languish for well over a year or two years or three, three years or how old's the Mac Pro
[02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:37.520]  10 years? It's very old. No. It seems like it's the iMac is not a device that Apple has
[02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:41.840]  let languish the you know, even if you want to argue that their focus is on Mac books and
[02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:47.200]  portables instead of desktops, the iMac has never lost favor with Apple. So 500 days is unusual.
[02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:55.120]  I almost feel like it's 500 days not because they've taken her eye off the ball, but that
[02:07:55.120 --> 02:08:01.520]  the last update to the iMac 5k was so good that it could go over a year without an update. I mean,
[02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:07.280]  obviously, it's fallen behind the state of the art and Intel chips. But I still have my desktop
[02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:13.520]  is the original 5k iMac. And then I don't know how long out here. A year plus later, they came
[02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:19.840]  out with one that looks the same from the outside. But the display ads, you know, the, the, the
[02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:25.600]  greater color gamut, etc. It's even better display. So I don't know, but it's, you know,
[02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:29.920]  everybody just says they might come out with new iMacs. But nobody really knows what is it really
[02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:33.360]  just a speed bump? Are they just going to look the same and have the same display and they're just
[02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:39.280]  updating to newer CPUs? Or is there going to be more to it than that? I don't know. Yeah.
[02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:45.280]  An update to the Mac Mini. Now there's there. That would be I can't wait to see what the reaction is
[02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:50.960]  in a room. You know, like, if that actually and it's weird, like people are saying that might
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:56.000]  happen under a supplies, but it's not it hasn't really leaked, you know, they get nobody knows.
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:01.120]  And again, is it going to be the exact same form factor? And they've just, here's a new one with
[02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:06.000]  a new chip. Because I honestly feel I've written this several times, compared to some of these
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:10.800]  knucks, I don't even know what it stands for. Well, do you know what that? Yeah, I don't either. I
[02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:17.120]  don't either. I know. I've looked at them several times. And I don't know. Compared to some of these
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:24.000]  and you see computers, like Intel has the iPad Mini is not many at all. I'm the Mac Mini. I mean,
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:29.680]  the Mac Mini is no longer many at all compared to those. Yeah. And it's slightly unfair because the
[02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:35.600]  knucks don't have an internal power supply. They have an external power supply. And so you know,
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:40.400]  but you could you could put that external power supply next to it. And it still is smaller than
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:47.280]  the Mac Mini. The Mac Mini really is not many. So it would be exciting if it's like the next
[02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:53.600]  in the next use. Don't the next use flash? I think so. Yeah. Right. And these, I mean, like,
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:10:00.000]  most of the current Mac Mini still have like spinning drives, right? Right. Well,
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:04.720]  to me, the comparison and I've made this before, but it and I really think that the benchmark even
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:10.880]  shows that, you know, like, Apple TV 4k is like, I don't think there is a version of Geekbench for
[02:10:10.880 --> 02:10:16.480]  Apple TV for some reason. But I, you know, I think it's a faster computer than the current Mac Mini.
[02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:22.080]  And if not, it's certainly on par. And it's, you know, it's obviously using ARM, not Intel,
[02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:27.840]  and it has SSD, not a hard drive. But it doesn't have an external power supply. And it is a
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:35.280]  computer. And it is fast. And it is mini. And then also, it was the Yeah, I would, I would certainly
[02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:40.320]  hope that it's an updated form factor. Right. I mean, at this point, take what we can get,
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:47.280]  I guess. It's just bizarre that the Apple TV is a smaller, better computer than, than the Mac Mini.
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:53.600]  Yeah, just doesn't seem right at all. Right. So that, you know, and I know, again, is it,
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:58.640]  you know, is it essential to Apple's bottom line? No, of course not. But there are a lot of people
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:04.320]  who like the Mac Mini. And I want to get I want to get one as a Plex server, just as immediate for
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:10.640]  a media server. I've been holding off for, well, and yours. Not quite that one. Who knows if he's
[02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:15.680]  right or not. But the thing that stuck out to me was that German. In his article, I think German
[02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:18.960]  said something about a new Mac Mini and said that it would, you know, it didn't have any details
[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:22.720]  about what it would look like or what else but that it would be somehow geared towards
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:27.440]  enthusiasts. And I can't help but think that what you're, you know, using it as a Plex server or
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:32.240]  something like that is exactly, you know, the thinking, you know, that, why not sell,
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:39.040]  have Apple sell something to Mac nerds who want to buy a Mac and have it running all the time to
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:44.160]  do something like that? Like, why make Mac nerds go to other vendors? Why, why break them out of
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:51.760]  the Apple universe? Yeah, I don't know. I didn't want I mean, like Jason Snell went to the trouble
[02:11:51.760 --> 02:12:00.160]  to, to Frank and Mac, whatever you call it. He got a he got a NUC and installed the OS 10 on it.
[02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:05.520]  Yeah, I saw that Mac OS. Sorry. Yeah. Hackintosh is what they call it. Hackintosh. There we go.
[02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:14.000]  Yeah. That's it. You know, I was thinking, I guess I could Google it. But I was wondering,
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:17.440]  it seems like everybody makes a Hackintosh. It's always like a desktop. It doesn't seem like
[02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:23.200]  anybody makes one out of a laptop. And I just got to thinking about it. Like, I'm worried about
[02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:31.840]  these MacBook keyboards. Like Casey Johnston, who writes for the, the outline now and has written a
[02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:37.120]  bunch series of pretty good articles, really good articles, I should say on the MacBook keyboard
[02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:43.840]  saga. Yeah. You know, and it started with her taking her MacBook Pro in and, and the genius
[02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:48.560]  told her, Well, it's obviously broken, you, you, you got, you got a speck of dust under the key.
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:54.720]  What were you doing? You know, like, literally, it was like, what do you expect? There's a speck
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:58.080]  of dust in there. Of course, the key is going to get stuck. Anyway, she's written a bunch of
[02:12:58.080 --> 02:13:05.920]  articles. And her most recent one was about, you know, do does this new third generation MacBook
[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:12.240]  Pro keyboard with this membrane? Does it solve the problems and sort of an unsatisfying article
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:17.600]  in a way? Because the answer is sort of maybe it's like, we don't know. She talked to like,
[02:13:17.600 --> 02:13:23.360]  Apple Store employees, and they said, Yes, like, yeah, this was a big problem with MacBook Pro
[02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:30.000]  keyboards. And now it's not. And, you know, you, the cynic in you wants to say, well, Apple Store
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:33.440]  employees, of course, they're going to say that they're, you know, they're, they're towing the
[02:13:33.440 --> 02:13:37.600]  company line, but they're not being quoted by name by her. It's not like, you know, Apple Store
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:45.920]  genius, john moltz is, you know, says, quick trip to being fired. Apple products are great,
[02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:51.600]  and they don't have a keyboard problem. You know, I don't even know she identified herself as a
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:55.440]  reporter, you know, she, I think she just went in and just say, Hey, these keyboards working. And
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:59.200]  in my experience, Apple employees, store employees will tell you, you know, if they don't know,
[02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:05.920]  you're the guy who writes a fireball there. They'll, they'll give you their honest advice,
[02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:10.080]  you know, I mean, there's no better example than that. Some of them will give you the honest
[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:15.680]  advice that you should quit your apps on your iPhone. I mean, they're not all, you know,
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:19.600]  it's not all good advice, but it's honest advice. Well, they're not all reading off the script.
[02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:24.800]  Yeah, is what I'm saying. Yeah. But on the other hand, she's pointed to a Mac rumors forum post
[02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:29.760]  where there are people with new MacBook Pros who are saying their keys are stuck or repeating,
[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:34.720]  and a couple of tweets from people. But it doesn't seem to be as widespread. But anyway,
[02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:39.600]  yeah, it seems like it's gotten better at least. Anyway, the thing that made me think of her series
[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:42.640]  was that her latest article, she said that somebody, you know, a couple people have said
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:47.280]  to her, like, don't worry about these keyboards, they're moving towards all glass keyboards that
[02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:53.440]  don't have moving keys at all. And we'll use haptic feedback. And I know Syracuse has mentioned
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:57.760]  this, you know, that if the keyboards are always getting thinner, eventually having a keyboard that
[02:14:57.760 --> 02:15:02.640]  doesn't literally click at all is the end goal. And at that point, I might be out.
[02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:10.000]  Like, I am too old to learn how to type on something like that. Like,
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:15.680]  yeah, I don't know if I can handle that either. I've seen people, you know, I've seen geniuses,
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:23.680]  actually, it's the typing on iPads at the store and typing incredibly fast. Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:28.320]  And I've just been like, blown away that anybody could do that. I've definitely seen it at the
[02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:32.320]  Apple Store, because they use iPads for all sorts of things. I've definitely seen it there.
[02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:37.280]  And I've seen it with kids, you know, like, and yeah, there's kids who use their iPad,
[02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:44.000]  and they type faster than I type on a real keyboard on the iPad keyboard. Way faster.
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:49.200]  I mean, so it's definitely a thing, but it ain't for me. Even with even with, you know, haptic
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:16:01.360]  feedback, it's, it's not gonna be good. I need my clicks. You need a you need a steampunk steampunk
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:06.000]  keyboard is what yeah, but anyway, I'm intrigued. It's obviously whatever MacBooks they come out
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:10.240]  with next week. I'm intrigued what the keyboard story will be. I mean, I would guess the betting
[02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:15.360]  money is it's going to be the, you know, third generation butterfly switches with the membrane.
[02:16:17.360 --> 02:16:20.080]  But it sure would be exciting if they were a little clickier.
[02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:28.480]  I don't like I wouldn't I wouldn't expect that that's gonna happen. But yeah,
[02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:36.800]  I is the airpower going to come out. It's a little it would be a little weird if it came out next.
[02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:43.040]  Well, that was the other thing that cool said, I think it's the same. I think he was predicting
[02:16:43.040 --> 02:16:47.600]  that would be so I think he was didn't he say that the he was thinking maybe the airpower in the
[02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:53.760]  iPad Mini might be late this year, early next year. Yeah. So who knows if they would come out
[02:16:53.760 --> 02:16:57.760]  at the event? I think it would be a little weird if it came out next week because next
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:04.480]  the airpower only works as well at least last we heard about it. Yeah. A year ago,
[02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:12.160]  I thought it was never going to come out. But it only works with iPhones, the Apple Watch,
[02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:23.920]  and a still as yet hasn't appeared. New AirPods charging case. So maybe AirPods are coming to
[02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:28.720]  maybe new AirPods are coming this week, because then at least there would be a look. Well,
[02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:34.160]  Karen just bought some so that would make sense. Make perfect sense if she just bought them.
[02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:40.160]  Because I just think it would be a little weird to introduce. Hey, here's the airpower. Finally,
[02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:45.600]  I don't expect them to say finally, but it certainly implied and maybe they would maybe
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:50.000]  they'll even address the fact that yeah, this is a little ridiculous. And maybe they'd even put up
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:56.160]  a finally slide. But it would be a little weird to me, stagecraft wise to enter say, okay,
[02:17:56.160 --> 02:18:01.600]  our power is finally here, but not have any new products that actually charged with it. Because
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:07.200]  the iPhones just came out a month ago, and the new Apple Watch just came out a month ago. And
[02:18:07.200 --> 02:18:12.880]  they don't tend to talk about products they've announced six weeks ago at a second event. Yeah,
[02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:18.000]  so the only thing they could say, and here's the new charging case for the AirPods would actually
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:22.640]  be something they could say, here's a new thing that actually charges with the airpower. But then
[02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:27.600]  the other thing that would be weird is if they don't announce the airpower on Tuesday, then
[02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:35.120]  when the hell is it coming out? Yeah. I mean, they've, you know, I don't know. It's such a
[02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:39.440]  weird story. So anyway, that's, you know, weird stories make for intriguing Apple events.
[02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:45.040]  Right? Is that isn't that what they say? Yeah, that's what they say.
[02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:52.080]  This week, that's what they say. Anything else? I haven't listened to Jason and Mike Hurley's.
[02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:58.240]  They do that draft thing there. They do a lot more, a lot more advanced thinking about what
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:03.520]  might be coming in an Apple event than I do. I just wait and find out what they say. I don't
[02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:07.200]  know if I'm missing. Am I missing anything that people are predicting for the event? I feel like
[02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:13.600]  I don't think so not real. I mean, not like anything that is likely to show up. Yeah,
[02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:21.840]  I think like the x factor would be like, if they've done something, you know, the iPad stuff,
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:27.600]  software wise, like, could they could there be like, some major, you know, new improvements
[02:19:27.600 --> 02:19:32.240]  to multitasking and stuff in in the iPad version of iOS that they've kept under wraps?
[02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:39.440]  Is there a, you know, what's what's the keyboard story for the iPads? Is are they still not going
[02:19:39.440 --> 02:19:46.480]  to have a trackpad? You know, I feel like the lack of a trackpad on the iPad is I, again, I'm old,
[02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:51.760]  and I've got these habits, and I wanted to work more like my Mac. I just think it's really,
[02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:58.160]  really weird that Apple says, we don't want to, we're not going to make touchscreen Mac books,
[02:19:58.160 --> 02:20:03.920]  because it's a bad form factor for reaching out and touching the screen to have this perpendicular
[02:20:03.920 --> 02:20:10.400]  screen that you reach out and poke at. And here's an iPad that you can use like a laptop keyboard
[02:20:10.400 --> 02:20:15.200]  with a keyboard that we make. And if you want to do anything, you have to reach out and poke at the
[02:20:15.200 --> 02:20:21.120]  screen in this way that we've said is ergonomically unpleasant. Like, I think it's a really weird
[02:20:21.120 --> 02:20:28.160]  story that would go away if they just put a trackpad on the keyboard cover. And then and
[02:20:28.160 --> 02:20:32.000]  you've talked about I mean, so you've talked about this previously or written about it rather
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:36.320]  endlessly. And you don't mean Yeah, you don't mean like, it wouldn't have a cursor?
[02:20:37.440 --> 02:20:45.680]  Well, I don't think so. I it could, you know, should it I don't know. But it could,
[02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:52.800]  and I played like Google has a new tablet, they call this pixel slate that runs Chrome OS,
[02:20:52.800 --> 02:20:57.760]  and they have a keyboard cover. And the keyboard cover is really pretty nice. And I think it's
[02:20:57.760 --> 02:21:03.680]  kind of a shame that it has better keys than a new MacBook. Although they made them round. Did
[02:21:03.680 --> 02:21:09.520]  you see this? They made them round like diamond. Yeah, like that. It's too cute by far. It's like,
[02:21:09.520 --> 02:21:13.280]  yeah, you should have if you would have just made them squares, you'd have a killer keyboard,
[02:21:13.280 --> 02:21:18.800]  but they made them round to be cute. And it's, it's not great, but they do click nice. But they
[02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:24.480]  have a trackpad. And I sat there at the Google hands on thing. And you know, it has a very similar
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:29.280]  smart connector to the to the iPad, you know, where it's, you don't have to stick anything
[02:21:29.280 --> 02:21:35.120]  into the USB C or anything, it's magnetic. And you connect it and an arrow cursor appears.
[02:21:35.840 --> 02:21:41.760]  And as soon as you disconnect it, the arrow cursor just disappears. So there's no confusion.
[02:21:42.720 --> 02:21:47.520]  You know, my best example at Philadelphia's airport is just chock full. It's American
[02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:51.680]  Airlines, actually nationwide American, which is where I fly all the time.
[02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:56.080]  Their check in kiosks are all the same, which I guess is good, because they're all the same. And
[02:21:56.080 --> 02:22:01.440]  they're all obviously running Microsoft Windows. And they are touchscreens. But there's a white
[02:22:01.440 --> 02:22:07.360]  arrow cursor. That's always visible. And that whenever you touch, I mean, it's 2018. And they,
[02:22:07.360 --> 02:22:12.880]  they have these touchscreens that have, you know, you're just, you're, you're touching
[02:22:12.880 --> 02:22:17.600]  you completely useless cursor. Yeah, well, it moves, it moves under whatever you touch.
[02:22:17.600 --> 02:22:23.360]  So you can't read it. It's, you know, there's ways to do this, right? I don't know that it
[02:22:23.360 --> 02:22:27.040]  should be an arrow cursor. I don't know if it would always be there. I mean, it just seems
[02:22:27.040 --> 02:22:31.200]  weird that you can't. It just seems weird to me that you ever have to reach up and touch the
[02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:37.280]  screen when it's docked. I mean, I, I would most want it just for text editing, you know, and in
[02:22:37.280 --> 02:22:44.000]  the way that you get that trackpad support on iPhones and iPads by touching the keyboard and
[02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:50.000]  moving around. I would like it if you had trackpad support just for text editing, if that's the only
[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:54.400]  thing they enabled it for, but why not allow it for other things? And I think they could do it
[02:22:54.400 --> 02:23:02.000]  without a cursor too. I've talked about this is, is by following the Apple TV design. So you,
[02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:06.000]  you could go to the home screen. Number one, you can't go to the home screen on the keyboard now.
[02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:12.000]  So I think that they should do that. They should have like a go home button. And then what you
[02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:17.360]  could do is move around the trackpad and it would pop the icons up like the icons on Apple TV. When
[02:23:17.360 --> 02:23:21.760]  you move around on the app, it'd be more like swiping them. Yeah. Then like, it would just be
[02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:26.080]  like Apple TV, you know, I forget what the name of that interface is, but you know, there's, it's
[02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:30.880]  called like 3d something. I don't know, but it, you know, it was already running on iOS. There's
[02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:36.160]  no reason that couldn't, it couldn't work on an iPad with the keyboard attached. So you wouldn't
[02:23:36.160 --> 02:23:41.360]  have a mouse cursor. You'd move around. Instead, you'd have an implicit selection that you would
[02:23:41.360 --> 02:23:46.160]  that you would move around and it would just move around the icons. And I think it could be very
[02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:50.960]  nice. And I think it ergonomically, it would be great because it really is ergonomically unpleasant
[02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:56.800]  when you're in a laptop form factor to reach up and poke at the screen. So anyway, that would be
[02:23:56.800 --> 02:24:01.840]  my hope that there's all sorts of goodies like that. It's not just new iPad hardware with,
[02:24:02.480 --> 02:24:06.800]  you know, smaller bezels and round corners and it works exactly like the old iPads.
[02:24:06.800 --> 02:24:12.640]  You know, I don't know why I can separate this in my mind because it doesn't really make that
[02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:18.080]  much sense, but I, if someone touches my screen, I never touch my Mac screen. If somebody else
[02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:24.800]  touches my Mac screen, I get unreasonably angry about it, but. I will, I will, you know, keep
[02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:28.560]  happily keep working on my iPad if there's a bunch of fingerprints on it. I mean, I shouldn't say
[02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:32.800]  happily, but I will, I will ignore them and keep working. And then eventually when it gets really
[02:24:32.800 --> 02:24:37.280]  bad, I'll pick it up and I'll wipe it off with my sleeve and go back when somebody, you know,
[02:24:37.280 --> 02:24:42.320]  I've had, I've told you before, I've had this Mac book pro for four years. So the screen has
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:46.320]  been touched, but the first time I, somebody touches my Mac screen, I really want to just
[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:53.280]  take the computer back and buy a new one. I just, it's like, all right, you know, you touch my
[02:24:53.280 --> 02:25:00.080]  screen. I get me a hard drive, super duper clone the drive, go buy a new one, restore the drive,
[02:25:00.080 --> 02:25:06.080]  open it up. And now I've got a screen that has never been touched by greasy humans. I,
[02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:10.640]  I really, I, I, nothing, my computer could be half functioning. Like
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:16.720]  Karen used to pick up. I don't think she, she's got an error. She's got an 11 inch
[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:19.840]  error now. And I don't think she does it at this device anymore because it doesn't,
[02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:25.360]  but it doesn't seem like the form factor is right for it, but not that this was right,
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:30.000]  but she used to constantly pick up her laptops by the lid, by the top of the lid.
[02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:35.600]  She would just, it would just be sitting on the couch or something like she'd go over and grab
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:40.240]  it by the top of the lid and lift it up and just like put her thumb right over the screen. Oh yeah.
[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:48.160]  Oh my God. What are you doing? Because your thumb would naturally go right over like the prime
[02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:52.640]  real estate of the screen, right? Like one or two inches down from the top, right in the center.
[02:25:52.640 --> 02:26:00.240]  Mm hmm. Right. Right in the sweet spot. Right in the sweet spot. Oh God. I'm trying to think
[02:26:00.240 --> 02:26:05.200]  anything. What else next week? I don't know. Why is it at the Brooklyn Academy of Music? I mean,
[02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:09.920]  I, that's a good question. All right. I mean, I don't, I assume it's not related to that. It's
[02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:13.920]  just the venue, but yeah, somebody told me there, there was a cool thing they did with the
[02:26:13.920 --> 02:26:19.760]  invitations where there are hundreds of different variations of the Apple logo in various artistic
[02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:25.120]  interpretations. I didn't follow along closely. Somebody was trying to gather them all and
[02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:29.040]  there's, there's names and they went to, somebody went to the Apple server and I thought somebody
[02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:33.600]  figured out that there were 236 variations, but then somebody on Twitter was telling me
[02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:38.000]  that they think everybody got a unique one because I don't know how many press invitations do they
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:44.320]  send out? If there's 230, if we know there's 236 unique ones, there might be one for everybody. I
[02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:48.800]  don't know. Mine doesn't look, it doesn't, certainly doesn't look like it was commissioned
[02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:54.160]  for me. It doesn't look like anything, you know, I think there's got to, even if they did make one
[02:26:54.160 --> 02:26:59.440]  for everybody, I think they assigned them randomly, but yeah, I did see something where somebody,
[02:26:59.440 --> 02:27:04.800]  there's some kind of speculation that there are, that they've sent illustrator, there's illustrators
[02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:10.080]  from around the world who've been brought to New York, you know, which would be a very appley thing.
[02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:19.120]  If there's a new pencil coming, that would make sense. And Adobe debuted Photoshop for iPad.
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:25.360]  It's not out, it's coming in quote unquote 2019, but at their Adobe Max conference a week or two
[02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:32.240]  ago and Phil Schiller actually was there, appeared on stage to say how happy he was about it and how
[02:27:32.240 --> 02:27:38.160]  closely Apple and Adobe are collaborating on this. So we'd expect to see that again probably.
[02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:43.520]  I would eat my hat if we don't see, I honest to God would eat my hat if Apple does not have
[02:27:43.520 --> 02:27:49.840]  Adobe come on stage and debut and demo Photoshop for iPad. As long as it's not another AR demo.
[02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:54.640]  And there's got to be some new angle to it too. It can't just be what they showed at max. Maybe
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:59.120]  it's just some kind of new feature in the pencil, you know, because obviously Adobe Max, it was on
[02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:03.840]  the existing iPad Pro with the existing pencil. Maybe there's some kind of new features that are
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:11.120]  enabled by this. There's some speculation that the switching to USB-C is about support for external
[02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:16.640]  displays with Thunderbolt. So maybe it's something like that. Like you can plug in an external
[02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:23.440]  display with your iPad and you can have your Photoshop on a big screen. Who knows? But it's
[02:28:23.440 --> 02:28:28.480]  got to be I will eat my hat if Adobe is not on stage to demo this because I think it is it of
[02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:33.360]  all the apps in the world that Apple would want to have a third party come up and demonstrate on
[02:28:33.360 --> 02:28:39.040]  an iPad Pro. I think Photoshop is number one. I literally don't think there's another app
[02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:45.920]  in any category that Apple would rather say there's here it is on the iPad Pro. I really
[02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:51.360]  mean that. Yeah. And it would fit in with this team of illustrators, you know, actual artists
[02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:58.880]  doing stuff. I think it's exactly the sort of thing that the iPad is just way better than a
[02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:05.120]  Mac for. You know, if you are the sort of person who can illustrate and being able to draw right
[02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:11.920]  on the screen with a really high refresh rate, accurate stylus type thing is way better on an
[02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:18.960]  iPad than it is on a Mac with a Wacom thing off to the side. Right. So I think that's coming.
[02:29:18.960 --> 02:29:22.080]  That's interesting. That's an interesting blade. If you're doing it on a big screen,
[02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:26.880]  how do you see you can't there's no cursor. Well, I don't know what the pitch would be,
[02:29:26.880 --> 02:29:30.640]  but I mean, I'm just totally spitballing here because that's what somebody said that that's
[02:29:30.640 --> 02:29:35.360]  the that would be maybe it even comes from Ming Chi Kuo with it. That's part of the USBC story,
[02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:40.800]  you know, that it's Thunderbolt three. I would guess that you the artist are looking at the,
[02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:46.560]  you know, iPad screen and then somebody, you know, it could be put on a bigger screen for
[02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:50.400]  somebody else to look at while you work for collaborative, you know, collaborating with
[02:29:50.400 --> 02:29:56.320]  somebody that seems less exciting, but maybe I don't know. I don't know. I'm just spitballing.
[02:29:56.320 --> 02:29:59.680]  Yeah, yeah. But I feel like they have to show something new. It can't just be the same thing
[02:29:59.680 --> 02:30:04.560]  they showed at Adobe Max with Photoshop. Yep. Right. I don't know what else. But I'm excited
[02:30:04.560 --> 02:30:07.920]  about it because almost none of this is leaked. And I just hope it doesn't leak. Yeah.
[02:30:10.720 --> 02:30:16.480]  The night before. Well, the stupidest thing was when the panzerino panzerino. I was staying in
[02:30:16.480 --> 02:30:23.600]  San Francisco for the Apple event and panzerino was staying up there too and has a car. So I just
[02:30:23.600 --> 02:30:29.200]  I rode down to Cupertino with him. And it's like while we're driving down is when the thing leaked
[02:30:29.200 --> 02:30:38.000]  that that all the the site map, the site map for apple.com included all the new products.
[02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:44.400]  What the hell? How does this happen? So I hope I hope there's no
[02:30:44.960 --> 02:30:48.800]  boners like that in the lead up to this. I'm like, I would like to have an event where
[02:30:48.800 --> 02:30:55.840]  there's a bunch of surprises. We've got the Bloomberg thing. I don't have much to say about
[02:30:55.840 --> 02:30:59.360]  it. Other than that, I think Yeah, I think there's not that much. I mean, they they're
[02:30:59.360 --> 02:31:03.200]  they're out on a limb there. And I know now Tim Cook has called for them to retract the story.
[02:31:03.200 --> 02:31:07.520]  Right. And that is it. You know, I don't want to get too inside baseball. But that's unprecedented.
[02:31:07.520 --> 02:31:12.720]  And I and there was somebody in addition to his retraction, there was somebody one of the articles
[02:31:12.720 --> 02:31:20.240]  about the retraction had a anonymous comment from presumably somebody in Apple PR, you know,
[02:31:20.240 --> 02:31:25.680]  somebody close to the situation said that Apple had had given long consideration to
[02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:30.560]  officially demanding a retraction. I guess they didn't demand it. But but stating that that
[02:31:30.560 --> 02:31:36.160]  Bloomberg should retract, because they they didn't want to come across as bullying that it's, you
[02:31:36.160 --> 02:31:44.800]  know, it's, it is not a good look in general for the world's largest company by by share value to
[02:31:44.800 --> 02:31:52.800]  tell a respectable news publication to attract a story. It is it's just not a good look. But the
[02:31:52.800 --> 02:31:56.800]  first and second biggest companies in the world, Apple and Amazon have both done come out and done
[02:31:56.800 --> 02:32:01.920]  that. It is unprecedented. It's not something companies do. It's certainly not something
[02:32:01.920 --> 02:32:08.240]  reputable companies do. Yeah, I think Bloomberg really screwed up. I think it seems like it.
[02:32:08.240 --> 02:32:12.400]  I think there's I mean, nobody else is backing them up on us. No. And that's the other thing
[02:32:12.400 --> 02:32:17.360]  that people have pointed out. And there are they even said, like the Washington Post put a team on
[02:32:17.360 --> 02:32:21.680]  this, the New York Times put a team on this, you know, and none of these other publications have
[02:32:21.680 --> 02:32:28.640]  come up with anything to corroborate this, let alone the fact that the thing that if the story
[02:32:28.640 --> 02:32:35.440]  were true, or mostly true, somebody by now would have found one of these super micro motherboards
[02:32:35.440 --> 02:32:40.080]  with a chip on it and said, here it is, here's the chip, here's the, you know, because nobody's
[02:32:40.080 --> 02:32:43.680]  found it. And you know, that security researchers are looking for it, because it would be a huge
[02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:49.120]  feather in their cap. If there are such boards out there, the first security researcher who can
[02:32:49.120 --> 02:32:54.160]  publicly find one and pointed out and, you know, analyze, you know, do the, you know, say,
[02:32:54.160 --> 02:32:59.040]  here's how it works. Here's what it does. It was going to be famous. Yeah. So I think Bloomberg
[02:32:59.040 --> 02:33:02.240]  screwed on that. I think Bloomberg is sort of hoping that this just washes. Oh, it's gonna be
[02:33:02.240 --> 02:33:06.560]  exactly. That's what's happening to rather than retract. I feel like they're just like,
[02:33:06.560 --> 02:33:08.000]  they're right. And they're running the clock out.
[02:33:14.720 --> 02:33:16.400]  Midterms are coming up. You know,
[02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:22.720]  how about that Christmas? How about Christmas after that? Yeah. How about that Trump fella?
[02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:31.600]  Anything else? I think that's about it. It's we've gone on pretty long anyway. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:37.280]  All right. I am hopefully going to do a show next week after the event. We'll see if we were right
[02:33:37.280 --> 02:33:41.680]  about any of this stuff. Yeah. John is always good to have you on. I think it's been a record
[02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:50.240]  breaking long stretch between you appearing on this show. Well, I went to jail. Well, I'm glad
[02:33:50.240 --> 02:34:00.480]  you're out. Me too. People can enjoy you on various podcasts. That's correct. Turning this
[02:34:00.480 --> 02:34:08.080]  car around with some other dads and the rebound, which we talk about this the same stuff and not
[02:34:08.080 --> 02:34:14.640]  as well. You saved your best stuff for your course. Well, sure. The speed Eric has guy gets
[02:34:14.640 --> 02:34:18.960]  upset when I don't mention the speed arrow cast. So I'm mentioning it here. What does that mean?
[02:34:18.960 --> 02:34:23.760]  It's about the TV show arrow and others. Now we also talk about some other superhero stuff with
[02:34:23.760 --> 02:34:30.000]  guy English. Yeah, with guy. Yeah. Guy English of. Yeah. Okay. The Canadian English is Yeah.
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:39.280]  And Dan Warren. All right. That's great. You have a good voice. You should do a lot of podcasts.
[02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:47.200]  Oh, thanks. My thanks to our sponsors. We've got Amazon Prime Video channels, which is just
