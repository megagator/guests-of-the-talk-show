[00:00.000 --> 00:02.480]  Ah, we got so much to talk about, I think.
[00:02.480 --> 00:04.160]  Yeah, we do.
[00:04.160 --> 00:05.160]  And here's one.
[00:05.160 --> 00:10.740]  We have well-prepared notes, which you helped prepare, which I forgot to add the big hack
[00:10.740 --> 00:15.600]  follow-up to, which is bizarre because it's my baby.
[00:15.600 --> 00:18.040]  I was going to say, this is your thing.
[00:18.040 --> 00:25.340]  You have a 50-word asterisk you have to attach to every Bloomberg story, and Bloomberg breaks
[00:25.340 --> 00:26.340]  a lot of news.
[00:26.340 --> 00:30.360]  Do you have a macro that you insert that in when you're blogging it?
[00:30.360 --> 00:33.560]  It's not a macro per se, but I have it saved, obviously.
[00:33.560 --> 00:36.560]  I have to rewrite it now.
[00:36.560 --> 00:40.840]  I'm dreading the next time Bloomberg does something link-worthy because I have to write
[00:40.840 --> 00:45.640]  a new footnote because they are not done.
[00:45.640 --> 00:47.420]  This is the strangest thing.
[00:47.420 --> 00:53.120]  So I woke up one day, and of course I'm inundated with texts that they've followed up, and I'm
[00:53.120 --> 00:56.000]  like, wow.
[00:56.000 --> 00:59.440]  And I'm not hung out to dry on this.
[00:59.440 --> 01:04.000]  I haven't said, I guarantee you that they're wrong.
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.920]  My point is, it certainly looks like they're wrong.
[01:06.920 --> 01:07.920]  Everybody says they're wrong.
[01:07.920 --> 01:11.320]  They've offered no proof, so they ought to retract it or prove it.
[01:11.320 --> 01:14.160]  And I thought, maybe they've got it, right?
[01:14.160 --> 01:16.280]  And it's the same two reporters.
[01:16.280 --> 01:24.560]  So oh, and I start reading, and it's like, this doesn't look like anything?
[01:24.560 --> 01:33.860]  And I described it as sophistic, I forget the word, sophistry, horseshit.
[01:33.860 --> 01:38.960]  And it is, because it creates the illusion of something there being there, and they're
[01:38.960 --> 01:50.160]  very deft at using official journalistic language and seemingly well-credentialed sources, some
[01:50.160 --> 01:55.400]  of them on the record even, none of whom with any firsthand knowledge of this.
[01:55.400 --> 01:58.600]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:58.600 --> 02:02.220]  It's crazy, in my opinion.
[02:02.220 --> 02:07.680]  And it really, really seems like they've spun themselves out of, this is my take, that they've
[02:07.680 --> 02:12.440]  spun themselves out of control to avoid retracting the original story.
[02:12.440 --> 02:13.440]  Yeah.
[02:13.440 --> 02:19.080]  I've been trying to figure this out too, because when it first hit, it was so damning.
[02:19.080 --> 02:23.160]  And I was like, okay, well, Bloomberg, because I know a lot of people who work there.
[02:23.160 --> 02:26.780]  And they're, for the most part, impeccable journalists and are held to extremely high
[02:26.780 --> 02:28.660]  standards and have very good sourcing.
[02:28.660 --> 02:34.600]  And so I didn't really have many reasons to doubt what was being reported.
[02:34.600 --> 02:40.640]  And then more, some of those doubts started to creep in, when every single company, if
[02:40.640 --> 02:44.360]  one company denies something, and if they do it in kind of a weaselly way, which is
[02:44.360 --> 02:48.960]  what companies usually do when they don't know exactly how exposed they may be, they'll
[02:48.960 --> 02:51.760]  deny it, but there will be wiggle room.
[02:51.760 --> 02:54.380]  The denials were pretty affirmative, right?
[02:54.380 --> 02:58.080]  There wasn't a lot of wiggle room to just be like, this hasn't happened.
[02:58.080 --> 03:01.120]  And that made my spidey sense go up a little bit first.
[03:01.120 --> 03:04.960]  And then seeing a lot of security professionals kind of push back and be like, are we sure
[03:04.960 --> 03:09.500]  does this make sense, has some questioning.
[03:09.500 --> 03:15.320]  But in the back of my mind, I was still like, okay, but Bloomberg has really, really good
[03:15.320 --> 03:16.320]  reporters.
[03:16.320 --> 03:22.680]  And they vet things really strongly, and their standards for publishing, based on my experience
[03:22.680 --> 03:26.280]  of people that I know they're going to talk to, are going to be higher than at a lot of
[03:26.280 --> 03:27.760]  other places.
[03:27.760 --> 03:34.680]  So it's this bizarre thing, right, is that there are these denials.
[03:34.680 --> 03:36.680]  There hasn't been a lot of conclusive proof.
[03:36.680 --> 03:42.280]  There are a lot of security professionals who are calling foul on it.
[03:42.280 --> 03:47.320]  And then this follow up story comes up, which substantively, you link to like a really good
[03:47.320 --> 03:54.220]  takedown thread from own all the things that really kind of supply the fact that, yeah,
[03:54.220 --> 03:58.560]  there was a lot of kind of nothing in the follow up.
[03:58.560 --> 04:03.920]  Well, and it's so, what's the name of the game whisper down the alley, you know, where
[04:03.920 --> 04:08.720]  somebody, you know, you have a bunch of kids lined up and yeah, telephone, you know, somebody,
[04:08.720 --> 04:11.800]  you know, you write something down and you tell the first person and then they're supposed
[04:11.800 --> 04:16.440]  to whisper it down to the next person and then the last person says what they're told.
[04:16.440 --> 04:18.680]  And it's inevitably different.
[04:18.680 --> 04:22.320]  Even if, you know, I always thought the thing about that when I was a kid was that there
[04:22.320 --> 04:25.680]  was always clear you can and you knew which kid in your class was going to do it with
[04:25.680 --> 04:28.440]  somebody was going to screw it up on purpose.
[04:28.440 --> 04:29.440]  Absolutely.
[04:29.440 --> 04:34.040]  And it's like, we're doing sociology here, you know, David, you jerk, you know, and he
[04:34.040 --> 04:38.760]  could have a smirk, you know, you know, it's like egg freckles.
[04:38.760 --> 04:41.000]  And it's like, Oh, come on.
[04:41.000 --> 04:44.340]  But it doesn't work, you know, and it's all, you know, but everybody, all these sources
[04:44.340 --> 04:50.400]  are saying like, you know, well, you know, in 2016, I got this scary briefing from the
[04:50.400 --> 04:54.600]  FBI about a thing that they heard that might have happened was super micro.
[04:54.600 --> 04:58.400]  And it's like, nobody is saying, Yeah, I saw a chip on a super micro board.
[04:58.400 --> 04:59.400]  Right.
[04:59.400 --> 05:00.400]  Right.
[05:00.400 --> 05:04.360]  No, I mean, the one thing that does always kind of give me flaws, though, though, and
[05:04.360 --> 05:08.600]  this is why it's such an interesting kind of conundrum to me, is that the one kind
[05:08.600 --> 05:12.560]  of thing I guess they could have in their favor, but they don't have the evidence that
[05:12.560 --> 05:13.560]  happened in this case.
[05:13.560 --> 05:15.400]  But, you know, you have Edward Snowden.
[05:15.400 --> 05:21.600]  And I think a lot of us had heard the things that he was claiming.
[05:21.600 --> 05:26.040]  A lot of people would have said that that was not that was not happening, right?
[05:26.040 --> 05:29.960]  That that it seemed it seemed like out of a Russian spy novel, right, right.
[05:29.960 --> 05:34.460]  And it was so.
[05:34.460 --> 05:38.720]  We as a species are not good with stuff that we think isn't expected.
[05:38.720 --> 05:39.720]  Right.
[05:39.720 --> 05:42.660]  I mean, did you expect to have a pandemic?
[05:42.660 --> 05:47.040]  And if you did, I mean, and if you did, did you expect it to go this way?
[05:47.040 --> 05:48.040]  Right?
[05:48.040 --> 05:53.540]  Like, that's one of the craziest things about the last 11 months is we have had a global
[05:53.540 --> 05:58.600]  pandemic and it is nothing like anybody's science fiction about how a pandemic would
[05:58.600 --> 05:59.600]  go.
[05:59.600 --> 06:06.560]  They either turn into zombies, which is better for the drama, or it's like Stephen King's
[06:06.560 --> 06:13.760]  The Stand and 95% or plus 95% plus of humanity gets killed.
[06:13.760 --> 06:19.120]  And there's only a handful of, you know, you're lucky if maybe, you know, one out of 20 people
[06:19.120 --> 06:22.000]  you know survives.
[06:22.000 --> 06:23.280]  And this was nothing like that.
[06:23.280 --> 06:28.320]  It was, you know, it just you just stay home, you know, but it seemed like a this couldn't
[06:28.320 --> 06:29.320]  happen.
[06:29.320 --> 06:33.640]  Like, literally a year ago right now, that was sort of my thinking about it, which was
[06:33.640 --> 06:34.640]  irrational.
[06:34.640 --> 06:37.640]  No, that was really my thinking.
[06:37.640 --> 06:39.720]  Yeah, I was like, well, it won't happen here.
[06:39.720 --> 06:44.160]  I remember I had a podcast with Federico Vittucci and you know, he was around this time.
[06:44.160 --> 06:48.080]  I think it might have been a little bit later in February, you know, and Italy got hit hard
[06:48.080 --> 06:52.520]  already in February.
[06:52.520 --> 06:57.960]  I don't think it's like, it's not some kind of, you know, America Firstism that I think
[06:57.960 --> 06:59.440]  America's magic.
[06:59.440 --> 07:03.880]  It's just the way human nature works, where it's like, well, you know, these things happen,
[07:03.880 --> 07:04.880]  you know.
[07:04.880 --> 07:05.880]  They don't happen here.
[07:05.880 --> 07:06.880]  They don't happen here.
[07:06.880 --> 07:10.040]  And yeah, no, I mean, do you think that then that's what you think with Bloomberg?
[07:10.040 --> 07:11.040]  Exactly.
[07:11.040 --> 07:12.040]  Yeah.
[07:12.040 --> 07:13.040]  I mean, that's very true.
[07:13.040 --> 07:19.200]  I mean, I'm actually kind of looking I, I was it was a year ago, today, I think that
[07:19.200 --> 07:22.240]  I was flying back.
[07:22.240 --> 07:25.480]  Or I guess technically would be tomorrow, but I was on an airplane at this point that
[07:25.480 --> 07:28.280]  I was flying back from Australia.
[07:28.280 --> 07:32.640]  For what won't be my last International Trip of the Year and to I was originally supposed
[07:32.640 --> 07:38.160]  to go from Australia to Singapore for an event and the Singapore event was cancelled because
[07:38.160 --> 07:41.880]  they weren't doing events of a certain size and that country was taking precautions really
[07:41.880 --> 07:42.880]  strictly.
[07:42.880 --> 07:45.420]  However, the airlines weren't cancelling flights.
[07:45.420 --> 07:53.740]  So I to get home without incurring a ton of fees, I flew from Sydney to Singapore.
[07:53.740 --> 07:57.000]  Then I had like a couple hour layover in the airport and then I flew from Singapore to
[07:57.000 --> 07:58.000]  South Korea.
[07:58.000 --> 08:02.960]  Then I had like a six or seven hour layover where I got like a hotel room in the pod or
[08:02.960 --> 08:04.340]  whatever in the airport.
[08:04.340 --> 08:07.420]  And then I flew from South Korea to Seattle.
[08:07.420 --> 08:12.000]  So I was I was in the air for like 27 hours, it was kind of insane.
[08:12.000 --> 08:14.760]  And that was my last International Trip of the Year.
[08:14.760 --> 08:20.680]  And even though the Singapore stop of the event I was presenting at was cancelled, I
[08:20.680 --> 08:26.520]  still had you know, scheduled things for Zurich and for Israel and I think some other places
[08:26.520 --> 08:29.240]  and was expecting that to go forward.
[08:29.240 --> 08:33.040]  Like was not anticipating that, oh, yeah, the world is going to change and it's going
[08:33.040 --> 08:34.120]  to come here.
[08:34.120 --> 08:41.080]  Like, no concept seems unrelated, but I mean, that is sort of how you think about a publication
[08:41.080 --> 08:48.760]  like Bloomberg, you know, and it's true, you know, and it's, it's the burden and the benefit
[08:48.760 --> 08:55.080]  of the bureaucracy of something that's an institution and you know, it's not like reporters
[08:55.080 --> 09:02.120]  for Bloomberg get to just type into the CMS and hit publish and now it pops up.
[09:02.120 --> 09:10.880]  You know, I remember thinking I remember being not not opposed to but thinking it wasn't
[09:10.880 --> 09:18.020]  going to happen that Apple would switch from Power PC to Intel back back in 2005.
[09:18.020 --> 09:19.920]  And then the rumors picked up a little bit.
[09:19.920 --> 09:24.200]  But it wasn't like this year where it was like, oh, months in advance, everybody knew
[09:24.200 --> 09:26.080]  it was going to happen.
[09:26.080 --> 09:30.960]  But then like the weekend before WWDC, the Wall Street Journal published a story that
[09:30.960 --> 09:36.400]  said Apple's going to announce that they're switching the Mac to Intel.
[09:36.400 --> 09:41.400]  And I had to square those two things in my head that I didn't think it was going to happen
[09:41.400 --> 09:45.760]  for various reasons, including the fact that I thought, you know, one of the things that
[09:45.760 --> 09:51.640]  I thought went unsaid at the time was, well, wait, if they port the Mac to standard x86
[09:51.640 --> 09:57.520]  hardware, then what would you know, wouldn't that make what we now call hackintoshes just
[09:57.520 --> 09:58.520]  run rampant?
[09:58.520 --> 10:02.480]  Wouldn't it, you know, wouldn't that be sort of like the clone days again, except without
[10:02.480 --> 10:05.600]  even even without the clone licensing fees, right?
[10:05.600 --> 10:10.520]  But I had to square my thinking my reasons x, y and z for thinking Apple wouldn't do
[10:10.520 --> 10:14.280]  it with the fact that the Wall Street Journal said, Oh, yeah, it's happening.
[10:14.280 --> 10:17.600]  And right, I came to the conclusion that, well, if the journal says it's happening,
[10:17.600 --> 10:18.600]  it's happening.
[10:18.600 --> 10:21.920]  Let's see, you know, let's wait till Monday and the keynote and see why.
[10:21.920 --> 10:28.480]  Right, which was, which is the correct thing, because, like, you know, I mean, and I think
[10:28.480 --> 10:33.720]  for a lot of people like that, I wasn't doing what you were doing back in 2000.
[10:33.720 --> 10:34.720]  What was it?
[10:34.720 --> 10:35.720]  2005?
[10:35.720 --> 10:39.200]  Yeah, I was still in college, but I was I was watching those things.
[10:39.200 --> 10:42.320]  But I would have made the same assessment that you did, I would have been like, okay,
[10:42.320 --> 10:45.960]  if the Wall Street Journal is saying this, then then this is true, right?
[10:45.960 --> 10:51.080]  Because that typically is, especially with Apple, like now Apple, the leaks tend to happen
[10:51.080 --> 10:52.720]  months in advance.
[10:52.720 --> 10:55.760]  But you know, they were much more closely held then.
[10:55.760 --> 11:00.480]  But if you had like a really big outlet, like, really well placed place like the journal,
[11:00.480 --> 11:04.480]  then you'd be like, okay, my my bet is going to be that this is happening, because they're
[11:04.480 --> 11:09.720]  not going to risk their reputation on being wrong about something like this.
[11:09.720 --> 11:13.080]  And I mean, I think that that is part of like, with the super micro story, you know, part
[11:13.080 --> 11:18.480]  of me is like, would Bloomberg risk their reputation for being wrong?
[11:18.480 --> 11:25.680]  And I mean, clearly, clearly they are clearly they, they think that they've got it, but
[11:25.680 --> 11:26.840]  I'm not convinced.
[11:26.840 --> 11:27.840]  You're not convinced.
[11:27.840 --> 11:29.760]  A lot of other people aren't convinced.
[11:29.760 --> 11:33.720]  There's there's a couple of ways, you know, I mean, number one, you never bet the house
[11:33.720 --> 11:35.320]  on any one report.
[11:35.320 --> 11:36.320]  Anybody could be wrong, right?
[11:36.320 --> 11:40.480]  I mean, the most famous example, I would say would be Judith Miller's report for the New
[11:40.480 --> 11:45.080]  York Times on the Iraq war, where she said, you know, and and again, there's always the
[11:45.080 --> 11:49.180]  Well, how does this news reporter say they know what they say they know.
[11:49.180 --> 11:56.280]  And the Wall Street Journal, it with the power PC story said, according to sources, sources
[11:56.280 --> 11:59.960]  familiar with the matter, but somebody at Apple who knew about it blabbed to the Wall
[11:59.960 --> 12:04.640]  Street Journal, whether deliberately or not, but the Wall Street Journal trusted that person
[12:04.640 --> 12:06.760]  enough to say this is this is good.
[12:06.760 --> 12:07.760]  Let's go with it.
[12:07.760 --> 12:08.760]  Right.
[12:08.760 --> 12:12.160]  You know, Judith Miller back in their run up to the Iraq war quoted somebody in the
[12:12.160 --> 12:18.000]  US national security opera apparatus who said we know that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.
[12:18.000 --> 12:19.000]  We know it.
[12:19.000 --> 12:20.000]  Yeah, done deal.
[12:20.000 --> 12:21.920]  We're going to go in and get them.
[12:21.920 --> 12:24.840]  And it turned out well, guess what they didn't.
[12:24.840 --> 12:29.700]  And the New York Times still to this day, I don't think for a generation won't recover.
[12:29.700 --> 12:33.800]  There's a lot of people who will never, never I mean, it was that and Jason Blair happened
[12:33.800 --> 12:37.800]  at the same time around the same time, it was kind of that one, two punch.
[12:37.800 --> 12:38.800]  Yeah.
[12:38.800 --> 12:39.800]  And Blair.
[12:39.800 --> 12:40.800]  Yeah.
[12:40.800 --> 12:42.520]  Blair being a fabulous is a little bit of a different thing.
[12:42.520 --> 12:43.520]  Right.
[12:43.520 --> 12:44.520]  Oh, I agree.
[12:44.520 --> 12:46.160]  I think it was just the two happening completely together.
[12:46.160 --> 12:47.160]  Yeah.
[12:47.160 --> 12:48.160]  Yeah.
[12:48.160 --> 12:49.160]  Yeah.
[12:49.160 --> 12:50.160]  That is true.
[12:50.160 --> 12:52.320]  Because they were so close in proximity where it's like, yeah, you can't trust the thing.
[12:52.320 --> 12:55.800]  And there's so many people who wanted to say for years, you can't trust anything in the
[12:55.800 --> 12:56.800]  New York Times.
[12:56.800 --> 12:57.800]  Exactly.
[12:57.800 --> 12:58.800]  Period.
[12:58.800 --> 13:01.900]  And then, you know, it was her who, you know, I don't even know, she was she an opinion
[13:01.900 --> 13:02.900]  columnist that point?
[13:02.900 --> 13:03.900]  That's true.
[13:03.900 --> 13:04.900]  No, she's a news reporter.
[13:04.900 --> 13:06.680]  But she changed beats a lot.
[13:06.680 --> 13:09.480]  But it was one of those things where she was not well respected.
[13:09.480 --> 13:13.480]  I read this book, I think it was called Page One Up, I'm going to find it, but I read this
[13:13.480 --> 13:17.840]  book that was written about what happened at the New York Times in the midst of those
[13:17.840 --> 13:18.840]  scandals.
[13:18.840 --> 13:19.840]  It's really interesting.
[13:19.840 --> 13:25.320]  And, you know, she had lost a lot of favor in the newsroom.
[13:25.320 --> 13:29.760]  But she had these impeccable sources, which we now know to be, you know, people like Scooter
[13:29.760 --> 13:35.840]  Libby and Robert Novak and other people that like were reputable sources.
[13:35.840 --> 13:39.720]  If somebody like that is telling you these things, I can understand, even for someone
[13:39.720 --> 13:44.560]  like her, who my only interaction with her was I was in the green room with her at a
[13:44.560 --> 13:48.840]  cable network once and she didn't know how to use copy and paste on her iPhone.
[13:48.840 --> 13:49.840]  Really?
[13:49.840 --> 13:51.040]  Oh, no, this is a great story.
[13:51.040 --> 13:54.720]  Yeah, I had to show her how to use copy and paste on her iPhone.
[13:54.720 --> 13:56.280]  And this was like 2014.
[13:56.280 --> 13:57.280]  Yeah.
[13:57.280 --> 13:58.280]  Yeah.
[13:58.280 --> 14:05.400]  That to me says kind of everything you need to know.
[14:05.400 --> 14:10.640]  But like, you know, she lost a lot of favor in the newsroom, but she had those sources
[14:10.640 --> 14:17.000]  and they didn't have the proper checks and like they went through a really big kind of
[14:17.000 --> 14:21.880]  reckoning, you know, like Howard Raines' like reign, you know, as editor kind of came
[14:21.880 --> 14:22.880]  to an end.
[14:22.880 --> 14:25.440]  Like they had to go through a pretty massive reckoning over that.
[14:25.440 --> 14:26.440]  And I think you're right.
[14:26.440 --> 14:30.920]  I think they, I don't know if they, I don't know if I would argue they haven't recovered.
[14:30.920 --> 14:34.120]  I think there's a certain generation of people who don't even remember that happening, you
[14:34.120 --> 14:38.120]  know, but I do think it tainted them in a way that even if people don't remember that
[14:38.120 --> 14:43.160]  happening probably are impacted by that without even realizing it.
[14:43.160 --> 14:44.160]  Right.
[14:44.160 --> 14:48.440]  So like if you look at like journalism students today and younger news readers today who were
[14:48.440 --> 14:54.320]  children and don't remember that, the lasting impact of what that did to the Times' reputation
[14:54.320 --> 14:56.100]  carries through.
[14:56.100 --> 15:00.600]  And so they might not even, it's like the Devil Wears Prada scene where, you know, Miranda
[15:00.600 --> 15:06.040]  is telling Andy that, you know, the sweater that she's wearing was, you know, that she
[15:06.040 --> 15:11.160]  thought was made with no decision whatsoever, was like made, was a decision that was predetermined
[15:11.160 --> 15:12.440]  for her by everyone in that room.
[15:12.440 --> 15:17.880]  I feel like it might be that sort of thing where younger news readers don't even understand
[15:17.880 --> 15:19.920]  why they might have a certain perception.
[15:19.920 --> 15:20.920]  But it does go back to that.
[15:20.920 --> 15:21.920]  I think you're probably right.
[15:21.920 --> 15:26.000]  But I mean, I think they've recovered a lot, but it certainly was like an incredibly painful
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.080]  time for the Times.
[15:30.080 --> 15:35.520]  The question always is if the only source is an unnamed source or even just a named
[15:35.520 --> 15:41.320]  source, but it's you have to take the source's name for it, where do you draw the line on
[15:41.320 --> 15:47.320]  the magnitude of the allegation, whatever you want to call it, you know, what they're
[15:47.320 --> 15:54.760]  saying with do we need more sources to say the same thing and when do you need to see
[15:54.760 --> 15:57.960]  the actual proof right now?
[15:57.960 --> 16:03.120]  I know we're mixing some big stories here, but it wasn't practical for the New York Times
[16:03.120 --> 16:08.640]  to expect to get their eyes on the actual weapons of mass destruction in Iraq before
[16:08.640 --> 16:09.640]  the war.
[16:09.640 --> 16:10.640]  Right.
[16:10.640 --> 16:11.640]  That's right.
[16:11.640 --> 16:15.220]  Literally wasn't possible with the super micro story.
[16:15.220 --> 16:17.280]  It is not.
[16:17.280 --> 16:22.720]  It wasn't ridiculous to think, given the accusations of the original 2018 story that they would
[16:22.720 --> 16:31.240]  want to see one of these compromised motherboards with a chip or at least talk to a source who
[16:31.240 --> 16:37.920]  would say, yes, I saw one of the boards with one of these chips and identified that one
[16:37.920 --> 16:39.600]  of these chips was doing this.
[16:39.600 --> 16:40.720]  And they had neither.
[16:40.720 --> 16:45.480]  They didn't even have a firsthand source, let alone physical proof.
[16:45.480 --> 16:49.140]  And one of the things that always stuck out to me as like, okay, we'll see where this
[16:49.140 --> 16:57.180]  goes and that I can't believe that here we are two and a half years later and still doing
[16:57.180 --> 17:04.160]  it is that even one of the two reporters on the story, Michael Riley tweeted like a day
[17:04.160 --> 17:08.720]  or two after the original story broke, he tweeted, that's the unique thing about this
[17:08.720 --> 17:09.720]  attack.
[17:09.720 --> 17:13.780]  Although the details have been very tightly held, there is physical evidence out there
[17:13.780 --> 17:14.780]  in the world.
[17:14.780 --> 17:19.680]  Given that the details are out, it will be hard to keep more from emerging.
[17:19.680 --> 17:21.400]  And yet no one's been able to follow up.
[17:21.400 --> 17:22.400]  Right.
[17:22.400 --> 17:23.400]  Which it.
[17:23.400 --> 17:24.760]  That to me is the biggest thing.
[17:24.760 --> 17:28.840]  It's not even so much anything else is the fact that there hasn't been any follow up.
[17:28.840 --> 17:32.600]  Just for any listeners who might be interested that the book I was talking about is called
[17:32.600 --> 17:36.720]  Hard News, the Scandals at the New York Times and the Future of American Media.
[17:36.720 --> 17:38.920]  And it's by Seth Mnookin.
[17:38.920 --> 17:44.520]  It's a good read, but yeah, I think the fact there was no follow up because the thing is
[17:44.520 --> 17:49.160]  I would expect like for something like this, even if they got some of the details wrong,
[17:49.160 --> 17:52.120]  which I would expect, I wouldn't expect everything to be completely correct.
[17:52.120 --> 17:59.040]  But if if parts of it were correct, I would expect that every major investigative publication
[17:59.040 --> 18:03.800]  on the planet would immediately be putting their own resources into trying to vet this
[18:03.800 --> 18:05.940]  out more.
[18:05.940 --> 18:08.920]  And there hasn't been anything right.
[18:08.920 --> 18:16.040]  Like you don't have to it you don't have to know how news organizations work to be a savvy
[18:16.040 --> 18:24.200]  or maybe to be a savvy news reader you do, but to be a well read up, you know, news reader.
[18:24.200 --> 18:32.760]  You don't have to know how movies are really made to enjoy movies, right?
[18:32.760 --> 18:37.920]  But when something interesting happens, it's it's good to know how it happens.
[18:37.920 --> 18:40.320]  And it can help explain why you're reading what you're reading.
[18:40.320 --> 18:44.200]  And one of the things that happens in the news industry is when somebody comes out with
[18:44.200 --> 18:51.540]  a scoop, competing news agencies, they are pissed, because everybody loves the scoops.
[18:51.540 --> 18:52.540]  They love it.
[18:52.540 --> 18:53.540]  They're like, why didn't I get this?
[18:53.540 --> 18:54.540]  Your editor is literally yelling at you.
[18:54.540 --> 18:57.100]  And he is saying to you, why do they have this?
[18:57.100 --> 18:58.100]  And why don't we?
[18:58.100 --> 18:59.100]  Right.
[18:59.100 --> 19:03.020]  And if they know who the source is, even if it's an unnamed source, and a lot of times
[19:03.020 --> 19:06.760]  they do, because you know, they're juiced into, they call the source and they're like,
[19:06.760 --> 19:09.640]  and they're pissed and they're like, why didn't you tell me this?
[19:09.640 --> 19:14.580]  But then the immediate thing they do is they jump on the story too, to follow it up.
[19:14.580 --> 19:19.680]  And they have to put the, as originally reported by the Washington Post, or as originally reported
[19:19.680 --> 19:24.600]  by whoever, but then what they want to do is add to it, right?
[19:24.600 --> 19:29.060]  So that the New York, you know, the Washington Post comes out with a big scoop about X, the
[19:29.060 --> 19:30.520]  New York Times is mad.
[19:30.520 --> 19:34.480]  They come out with their follow up, they have to acknowledge that the first reported in
[19:34.480 --> 19:41.460]  the Washington Post, it's like, they don't have to like legally, they have to as a convention.
[19:41.460 --> 19:46.920]  But then what they want to do is add original reporting to the story and build on it.
[19:46.920 --> 19:52.160]  And I know firsthand, I've spoken to people at news organizations who worked on this story.
[19:52.160 --> 19:53.160]  Like it is true.
[19:53.160 --> 19:56.360]  I know firsthand, I don't know everybody who worked on it.
[19:56.360 --> 20:01.760]  But I know that other major news publications put reporters on this story because it was
[20:01.760 --> 20:02.760]  so spectacular.
[20:02.760 --> 20:03.760]  Yes.
[20:03.760 --> 20:04.760]  I know that too.
[20:04.760 --> 20:05.760]  I know that too.
[20:05.760 --> 20:06.760]  Yeah.
[20:06.760 --> 20:07.880]  Nobody found anything.
[20:07.880 --> 20:13.840]  And it is the allegations of the original story, which literally involved the surreptitious
[20:13.840 --> 20:22.680]  adding of chips to motherboards and super micro server components literally would have
[20:22.680 --> 20:27.560]  left behind physical evidence that couldn't be erased as opposed to, and this is sort
[20:27.560 --> 20:30.520]  of where they're sort of walking it back.
[20:30.520 --> 20:37.240]  And in some ways, this follow up story last week is a broader allegation about the length
[20:37.240 --> 20:43.680]  of time and the degree to which super micro servers might have allegedly were compromised
[20:43.680 --> 20:51.480]  by government hackers from China.
[20:51.480 --> 20:58.680]  But it also seems to be, was definitely walking back the adding of chips and making more sort
[20:58.680 --> 21:07.960]  of hand-wavy motions about firmware, which A, it is a lot harder to prove.
[21:07.960 --> 21:13.160]  And because you can also, a clever piece of firmware could do its surreptitious business
[21:13.160 --> 21:16.840]  and then overwrite its naughty bits.
[21:16.840 --> 21:17.840]  Right.
[21:17.840 --> 21:18.840]  Yeah.
[21:18.840 --> 21:19.840]  No, I mean, we've seen that with SolarWinds, right?
[21:19.840 --> 21:20.840]  Right.
[21:20.840 --> 21:26.280]  The SolarWinds hack is actually quite incredible in what it was doing and was a very difficult
[21:26.280 --> 21:32.880]  thing to uncover because it was purposely not attacking a lot of the, you know, it was
[21:32.880 --> 21:38.320]  targeting the SolarWinds systems and then those were changing the way certain updates
[21:38.320 --> 21:45.240]  were issued to the other systems, but it was a very difficult thing to kind of unravel
[21:45.240 --> 21:47.760]  because of how it was done, right?
[21:47.760 --> 21:48.760]  So, yeah.
[21:48.760 --> 21:49.760]  Sorry, go on.
[21:49.760 --> 21:50.760]  Yeah.
[21:50.760 --> 21:51.760]  Well, it's a very casual person.
[21:51.760 --> 22:01.200]  I just kind of see how a software attack is both easier to implement and install and easier
[22:01.200 --> 22:02.200]  to hide.
[22:02.200 --> 22:03.200]  Right?
[22:03.200 --> 22:09.040]  The part of the blockbuster nature of the original 2018 Bloomberg report, the big hack,
[22:09.040 --> 22:12.200]  was that it was hardware and that the evidence would be out there.
[22:12.200 --> 22:16.300]  And they weren't saying like, oh, they got like three of these chips on three motherboards
[22:16.300 --> 22:20.920]  and one went to Apple and one went to this company that was acquired by Amazon and one
[22:20.920 --> 22:21.920]  went somewhere else.
[22:21.920 --> 22:26.560]  They said that there were like thousands of them and nobody found any of them, which really,
[22:26.560 --> 22:33.400]  really, I mean, at this point, it seems absolutely unbelievable that it actually happened.
[22:33.400 --> 22:34.400]  Yeah.
[22:34.400 --> 22:35.400]  Yeah.
[22:35.400 --> 22:39.320]  It's just, well, I mean, to me, the thing was actually, it was interesting that they
[22:39.320 --> 22:45.180]  did actually kind of use the SolarWinds hack, which is real and has been verified, to kind
[22:45.180 --> 22:52.120]  of bolster this kind of updated and sort of changed claim that this was BIOS code that
[22:52.120 --> 22:53.120]  was updated.
[22:53.120 --> 22:54.400]  And yeah, you know what?
[22:54.400 --> 23:02.560]  That does seem a lot more plausible, but to me, some of it does feel undercut by the nature
[23:02.560 --> 23:07.800]  of what the earlier reporting was, which I think is a bad thing because if this did happen,
[23:07.800 --> 23:11.520]  then that's a problem for everyone, right?
[23:11.520 --> 23:17.200]  I don't want this to be one of the situations where we ignore potential reporting that there's
[23:17.200 --> 23:24.960]  been malicious activity because the reporting on it was imperfect, but at the same time,
[23:24.960 --> 23:32.200]  the reporting is imperfect and doesn't seem to really go a long way to kind of explain
[23:32.200 --> 23:37.600]  itself or make a strong enough case for itself, whether it's because there are no on-the-record
[23:37.600 --> 23:42.720]  sources or because the people who are on the record don't have direct access or knowledge
[23:42.720 --> 23:43.720]  to things.
[23:43.720 --> 23:44.720]  Yeah.
[23:44.720 --> 23:45.720]  There's a lot of holes.
[23:45.720 --> 23:53.840]  I mean, and very specific allegations about Apple and Amazon in particular, which again,
[23:53.840 --> 23:58.080]  like you said, the two companies denied in no uncertain terms.
[23:58.080 --> 23:59.080]  I mean, a very—
[23:59.080 --> 24:00.080]  There were no weasel words.
[24:00.080 --> 24:01.080]  Right.
[24:01.080 --> 24:02.080]  Very unusual statements.
[24:02.080 --> 24:08.400]  And I know there are so many people, not a majority, but I know there's a number of people
[24:08.400 --> 24:14.320]  who just disbelieve anything that comes out of official corporate comms if it's to deny
[24:14.320 --> 24:16.280]  a negative story.
[24:16.280 --> 24:20.680]  And that's fine to be skeptical like that, but you have to acknowledge that it was not
[24:20.680 --> 24:23.760]  the typical weasel words that company—
[24:23.760 --> 24:24.760]  No.
[24:24.760 --> 24:27.800]  You know, there was no cover-your-ass aspect to it.
[24:27.800 --> 24:28.800]  No.
[24:28.800 --> 24:33.920]  Which to me was the first red flag when they were unequivocal in the denial and there weren't
[24:33.920 --> 24:34.920]  those weasel words.
[24:34.920 --> 24:37.840]  That was when I went, okay, because you know the lawyers have to go over every single line
[24:37.840 --> 24:38.840]  of that.
[24:38.840 --> 24:42.480]  And you're talking about two companies that have—at that point, they were closing in
[24:42.480 --> 24:43.840]  on a trillion-dollar market share.
[24:43.840 --> 24:49.280]  Now they're both—Amazon's a trillion and a half and Apple's a $2 trillion company.
[24:49.280 --> 24:54.680]  These are companies that if you were to be caught misleading and lying in any of your
[24:54.680 --> 24:59.000]  official communications this way would have massive, massive consequences.
[24:59.000 --> 25:03.040]  Like you want to talk about not just fines, but regulation and all kinds of other things.
[25:03.040 --> 25:08.760]  This is not something that I could ever see the lawyers signing off on if they didn't
[25:08.760 --> 25:13.160]  have full faith that what they were saying was accurate.
[25:13.160 --> 25:14.160]  Yeah.
[25:14.160 --> 25:18.920]  I read an interesting piece this week—I mean, just about everything she writes is
[25:18.920 --> 25:19.920]  interesting.
[25:19.920 --> 25:33.160]  She has a sub stack and she was writing about critical thinking and how to—like her upbringing
[25:33.160 --> 25:38.160]  in an authoritarian regime, she feels prepared her a lot better for the last year, both in
[25:38.160 --> 25:40.960]  terms of like, oh, okay, this is going to be bad.
[25:40.960 --> 25:45.480]  We should stock up on X, Y, and Z long before everybody else made a run on the toilet paper
[25:45.480 --> 25:54.680]  and stuff, but also sort of seeing through this sort of authoritarian slanted aspects
[25:54.680 --> 25:56.480]  of the Trump administration.
[25:56.480 --> 26:00.960]  And one of the points, just a small point she raised on the critical thinking, was when
[26:00.960 --> 26:04.040]  Trump got COVID.
[26:04.040 --> 26:07.360]  And she said, oh, he's way sicker than they're saying he is.
[26:07.360 --> 26:09.560]  And she, you know, she was like, oh, of course.
[26:09.560 --> 26:14.800]  And she was like, she linked to a tweet where somebody was—when his doctors gave a press
[26:14.800 --> 26:21.880]  conference outdoors and they asked, was Trump's oxygen level ever below 90?
[26:21.880 --> 26:26.480]  This is the blood oxygen level that your Apple Watch can in fact read now.
[26:26.480 --> 26:35.880]  And basically, just as a baseline, if you should be above 95, anything like 93 and below,
[26:35.880 --> 26:38.460]  if you have COVID, is considered a problem.
[26:38.460 --> 26:42.440]  And 80s is—anything in the 80s is bad.
[26:42.440 --> 26:46.600]  So the press asked his doctor, was Trump's oxygen ever below 90?
[26:46.600 --> 26:51.400]  And his doctor said, we don't have any recordings here of that.
[26:51.400 --> 26:55.160]  But was it ever below 90 here or at the White House?
[26:55.160 --> 26:58.840]  And his doctor said, no, it was below 94%.
[26:58.840 --> 27:02.480]  It wasn't down in the low 80s or anything.
[27:02.480 --> 27:03.480]  And she read into it.
[27:03.480 --> 27:06.440]  She was like, now I read this and I know how to read this.
[27:06.440 --> 27:10.160]  So when he's, you know, the operative words were his first answer when he said, we don't
[27:10.160 --> 27:13.040]  have any recordings here of that.
[27:13.040 --> 27:17.700]  That means that when he was here, I think this was outside the hospital, they just don't
[27:17.700 --> 27:18.800]  have recordings of it.
[27:18.800 --> 27:23.080]  But it did drop below 90.
[27:23.080 --> 27:28.400]  And when he said it was below 94, but it wasn't down in the low 80s, that means it was definitely
[27:28.400 --> 27:29.400]  in the 80s.
[27:29.400 --> 27:32.220]  It just wasn't like 81.
[27:32.220 --> 27:38.320]  And lo and behold, a week ago, it turned out Trump was a lot sicker than they let on when
[27:38.320 --> 27:39.320]  he had it.
[27:39.320 --> 27:43.360]  And there's sources who told the New York Times that, yeah, his blood oxygen was down
[27:43.360 --> 27:44.360]  to like 87.
[27:44.360 --> 27:47.360]  And that's when they panicked and took him to the hospital.
[27:47.360 --> 27:50.240]  And that's weasel words, right?
[27:50.240 --> 27:54.280]  And that's exactly what Amazon and Apple did not do when this came out.
[27:54.280 --> 27:55.380]  And they weren't blindsided.
[27:55.380 --> 27:56.680]  That's the other thing too.
[27:56.680 --> 28:00.760]  When the original Bloomberg big hack story came out, it wasn't like they dropped the
[28:00.760 --> 28:04.480]  story on Amazon and Apple and knee jerk reaction.
[28:04.480 --> 28:05.760]  Does anybody know about this?
[28:05.760 --> 28:06.760]  Nope, nope.
[28:06.760 --> 28:08.800]  Okay, let's just deny it.
[28:08.800 --> 28:14.560]  Like it contacted them in advance, both companies like, and I know, I talked to people off the
[28:14.560 --> 28:18.720]  record at Apple who were like, oh no, we did like, we spent a ton of money and pulled people
[28:18.720 --> 28:24.560]  off real work and tore server farms apart looking at this.
[28:24.560 --> 28:27.920]  We found nothing for weeks.
[28:27.920 --> 28:31.040]  And the other thing too, these weren't Apple products, right?
[28:31.040 --> 28:39.480]  It's not like Apple was saying that like millions of Mac pros or Mac minis weren't compromised.
[28:39.480 --> 28:44.880]  These were just internal to Apple servers from this super micro company and their denial
[28:44.880 --> 28:46.360]  just wasn't like that at all.
[28:46.360 --> 28:49.120]  There was nothing to read between the lines.
[28:49.120 --> 28:50.600]  Yeah.
[28:50.600 --> 28:54.400]  And I don't know the thing, and I wonder what your thought is on this.
[28:54.400 --> 28:57.960]  I don't know much about either of the reporters on the story.
[28:57.960 --> 29:04.640]  I think one of them is a cybersecurity reporter and I'm not sure what the other person's
[29:04.640 --> 29:06.840]  focus area is.
[29:06.840 --> 29:12.960]  It seems like that's what he's gone into, but it seems like, they seem more policy,
[29:12.960 --> 29:18.160]  more like, you know, wonk kind of, you know, DC kind of focus people.
[29:18.160 --> 29:24.400]  And I wonder, this is a similar thing in some cases to the Judy Miller thing.
[29:24.400 --> 29:27.780]  Now that was sloppy and that shouldn't have been published and they should have had better
[29:27.780 --> 29:28.780]  betting.
[29:28.780 --> 29:33.720]  There's a lot of layers to that, but you know, they, some of it couldn't come down
[29:33.720 --> 29:37.280]  to when you're an editor, if you don't know your subject matter and you trust your
[29:37.280 --> 29:40.360]  author to know it and to get some of those details.
[29:40.360 --> 29:46.240]  I wonder if this is one of those cases where these are people who know a lot about government
[29:46.240 --> 29:50.600]  and have a lot of contacts within government, but don't necessarily know enough about
[29:50.600 --> 29:53.320]  like actual security and about tech.
[29:53.320 --> 29:57.480]  I think that's exactly, I mean, cause their sources are all national security officials
[29:57.480 --> 30:01.600]  you know, quote unquote and you know, one guy, they make a big deal.
[30:01.600 --> 30:06.640]  He was a former Navy SEAL, which again, being a Navy SEAL is very prestigious, very difficult.
[30:06.640 --> 30:12.120]  Upper echelon of the armed forces doesn't necessarily make you an expert on, you know,
[30:12.120 --> 30:13.440]  Chinese supply chain espionage.
[30:13.440 --> 30:14.440]  Right, right.
[30:14.440 --> 30:17.880]  I mean, and I think that it's also worth noting, like there is a difference between
[30:17.880 --> 30:20.440]  cybersecurity and national security, right?
[30:20.440 --> 30:22.680]  Like they're both security, but they're different ways.
[30:22.680 --> 30:28.520]  And so that's the only thing, only way I can kind of try to kind of parse this in my mind
[30:28.520 --> 30:34.240]  is to see, okay, maybe the reporters really do believe what they're reporting and really
[30:34.240 --> 30:39.520]  do think the data says what it says, but they don't have the subject matter expertise and
[30:39.520 --> 30:44.600]  aren't talking to the subject matter experts enough to really be able to ascertain, is
[30:44.600 --> 30:45.600]  this possible?
[30:45.600 --> 30:46.800]  Did this happen?
[30:46.800 --> 30:48.520]  Is this likely?
[30:48.520 --> 30:53.200]  Because they're coming at it from a different perspective and from a different place.
[30:53.200 --> 30:57.400]  Yeah, yeah, that's what I think happened.
[30:57.400 --> 31:02.680]  And I also think that, well, why would they go so long without just retracting it?
[31:02.680 --> 31:08.320]  You know, and A, I think it's just anathema to them that they could have gotten something
[31:08.320 --> 31:09.640]  so wrong.
[31:09.640 --> 31:19.840]  And B, I think very cynically, they've looked at what this stinky pile of crap they were
[31:19.840 --> 31:25.120]  left holding that was never backed up by any evidence, never backed up by anybody else's
[31:25.120 --> 31:31.240]  reporting, and looked at it and it's all sort of, well, you can't prove a negative, right?
[31:31.240 --> 31:37.320]  Like if I say, guess what, Christina, there's an invisible man who's standing behind you
[31:37.320 --> 31:42.360]  and he's been there your entire life and you can't see him because he's composed of dark
[31:42.360 --> 31:43.360]  matter.
[31:43.360 --> 31:48.500]  I mean, probably I'm crazy, but you can't prove it, right?
[31:48.500 --> 31:52.880]  You can't prove that there isn't an invisible man from another dimension made of dark matter
[31:52.880 --> 31:57.200]  who's followed you around everywhere you go.
[31:57.200 --> 32:01.920]  You can't prove that there aren't, just because we haven't found the servers that Apple has
[32:01.920 --> 32:06.200]  that have these surreptitious microchips in them.
[32:06.200 --> 32:10.800]  You can't prove that they don't exist, and I think that's what they're hanging their
[32:10.800 --> 32:14.120]  hat on with their refusal to retract.
[32:14.120 --> 32:17.640]  Here's what I wrote back when the original report came out, and I feel like it really
[32:17.640 --> 32:18.640]  stands up.
[32:18.640 --> 32:22.140]  I see no way around it, either Bloomberg's report is significantly wrong, at least as
[32:22.140 --> 32:29.200]  it pertains to Amazon and Apple, or Apple and Amazon have issued blatantly false denials.
[32:29.200 --> 32:33.600]  You can perhaps chalk up Apple's denial to it being written by Apple PR.
[32:33.600 --> 32:38.120]  I don't think this would happen, but hypothetically, this issue could be deemed so sensitive either
[32:38.120 --> 32:41.900]  within the company or as a national security issue that the people at Apple with knowledge
[32:41.900 --> 32:46.780]  of the situation lied to Apple PR and then Apple PR issued a false statement.
[32:46.780 --> 32:50.380]  But in my experience, Apple PR does not lie.
[32:50.380 --> 32:52.640]  Do they spin the truth in ways that favor the company?
[32:52.640 --> 32:56.940]  Of course, that's their job, but they don't lie because they understand that one of Apple's
[32:56.940 --> 33:00.680]  key assets is its credibility.
[33:00.680 --> 33:02.740]  They'd say nothing before they'd lie, right?
[33:02.740 --> 33:07.340]  That's the thing that they could have done is just said, we have no comment on this.
[33:07.340 --> 33:14.140]  But Apple's CIO signing his name and writing his statement on Amazon's thing, that's Schmidt,
[33:14.140 --> 33:16.840]  signing his name to Amazon's report is more telling.
[33:16.840 --> 33:20.680]  Presumably no one at Apple or at Amazon would be more familiar with the details of this
[33:20.680 --> 33:25.000]  breach than Schmidt, and he vouched for it personally.
[33:25.000 --> 33:32.160]  Anyway, I can't help but think that you're onto something too, that Bloomberg has been
[33:32.160 --> 33:37.900]  sort of waiting to sort of, let's just push this vague thing out there to make it seem
[33:37.900 --> 33:42.060]  like we were on to, because that's the weird thing about this follow up there.
[33:42.060 --> 33:45.720]  They acknowledged the old story, but they didn't acknowledge that they're the same two
[33:45.720 --> 33:51.620]  reporters who wrote it, and they didn't acknowledge that nobody else ever proved it with Amazon
[33:51.620 --> 33:52.620]  and Apple.
[33:52.620 --> 33:56.260]  They just said, oh yeah, and by the way, two years ago, we said Amazon and Apple were affected
[33:56.260 --> 34:01.740]  by this, but it turns out we were onto a bigger story or something like that.
[34:01.740 --> 34:06.900]  And it sounds like, ooh, this is incredible, and then you read it and there's even less
[34:06.900 --> 34:07.900]  details.
[34:07.900 --> 34:11.500]  Now I've got to write a new footnote.
[34:11.500 --> 34:14.700]  All right, let me thank our first sponsor.
[34:14.700 --> 34:18.700]  It is a new sponsor, FlatFile.
[34:18.700 --> 34:23.360]  Nearly everyone has dealt with formatting CSV or Excel files so that the data can be
[34:23.360 --> 34:26.020]  correctly imported into your application.
[34:26.020 --> 34:27.420]  It's a pain.
[34:27.420 --> 34:31.460]  Companies of all sizes spend an exorbitant amount trying to fix this problem.
[34:31.460 --> 34:38.300]  Simple solutions include using CSV templates, emailing Excel files back and forth, or hiring
[34:38.300 --> 34:41.540]  expensive implementation teams to do it for you.
[34:41.540 --> 34:47.820]  Our friends at FlatFile are working on Concierge, which is their service that offers no-code
[34:47.820 --> 34:52.700]  collaborative workspaces for onboarding structured data.
[34:52.700 --> 34:58.260]  Invite customers to securely import, format, or merge data from spreadsheets.
[34:58.260 --> 35:05.340]  No fumbling around with FTP uploads, no emailing sensitive Excel files back and forth, no formatting
[35:05.340 --> 35:09.980]  yet another custom CSV template just for this data.
[35:09.980 --> 35:15.300]  FlatFile is on a mission to help companies spend less time formatting spreadsheet data
[35:15.300 --> 35:19.900]  to import into applications and more time using it.
[35:19.900 --> 35:21.960]  Curious how they can help your business?
[35:21.960 --> 35:28.700]  Visit them at FlatFile, F-L-A-T-F-I-L-E dot I-O.
[35:28.700 --> 35:33.180]  That's FlatFile dot I-O for all of your data importing needs.
[35:33.180 --> 35:39.860]  Do you want to stick with the news for now before we get into more analysis, the Apple
[35:39.860 --> 35:40.860]  Car thing maybe?
[35:40.860 --> 35:41.860]  What do you think of that?
[35:41.860 --> 35:42.860]  Yeah.
[35:42.860 --> 35:43.860]  Yeah, let's talk about the Apple Car.
[35:43.860 --> 35:45.740]  There's a lot of news on that.
[35:45.740 --> 35:50.380]  There is a lot of news on that, and I'm finally at the point where I knew that they were working
[35:50.380 --> 35:51.380]  on the project.
[35:51.380 --> 35:52.380]  Like they had stopped for a while.
[35:52.380 --> 35:59.180]  It does now seem like it is very much back up and running again, forgive the puns.
[35:59.180 --> 36:04.820]  I liked your piece on what the Volkswagen CEO said, especially because we've talked
[36:04.820 --> 36:09.980]  before about your love of going after Ed Colligan.
[36:09.980 --> 36:14.420]  But I'm curious from your perspective, and basically the news is that he kind of said
[36:14.420 --> 36:18.900]  that he came out and he's not concerned with any of their plans.
[36:18.900 --> 36:22.340]  There's also been rumors that they might be doing something with Hyundai.
[36:22.340 --> 36:27.820]  I did not realize that they're not quite the same company, but Hyundai owns a big portion
[36:27.820 --> 36:30.260]  of IKEA or vice versa.
[36:30.260 --> 36:34.020]  But anyway, in your home state of Georgia.
[36:34.020 --> 36:35.020]  Yeah, interesting.
[36:35.020 --> 36:36.020]  Interesting.
[36:36.020 --> 36:42.340]  Although, yeah, I think I remember now that they built plants there or whatever, but cool.
[36:42.340 --> 36:45.640]  The one thing that I don't get about the Apple Car, and I think at this point it's clear
[36:45.640 --> 36:50.580]  that they're doing something automotive, there are too many leaks and there's too many reports
[36:50.580 --> 36:51.580]  on this.
[36:51.580 --> 36:56.100]  I tend to agree with your analysis on the Volkswagen CEO.
[36:56.100 --> 37:01.700]  He's not dismissing them, but he's also, I think it's fair for him to be skeptical.
[37:01.700 --> 37:05.300]  I don't know why Apple wants to be in this space.
[37:05.300 --> 37:06.300]  That's what I can't figure out.
[37:06.300 --> 37:07.300]  That's a good question.
[37:07.300 --> 37:11.060]  And I've thought about that from the origins of the rumor.
[37:11.060 --> 37:15.300]  One thing I remember, and again, put a grain of salt in it, because again, this is like
[37:15.300 --> 37:21.420]  Whisper Down the Alley, this is like third hand, but from their first run through of
[37:21.420 --> 37:26.940]  this project, Titan, where they built it up and sort of specked out a car that they might
[37:26.940 --> 37:30.140]  have, could have maybe gone to market with.
[37:30.140 --> 37:36.940]  The story I've heard is that the price tag, it was something like $170,000 is like the
[37:36.940 --> 37:38.020]  starting price.
[37:38.020 --> 37:42.940]  And that's where Tim Cook was like, all right, well, we need to reset this.
[37:42.940 --> 37:46.060]  Let's get Bob Mansfield in there.
[37:46.060 --> 37:52.100]  And there was a lot of high level shuffling of priorities.
[37:52.100 --> 37:58.220]  And they sort of reset and focused supposedly on the core of the project for now on, well,
[37:58.220 --> 38:03.380]  let's just get the autonomous stuff down and we'll rethink the car part.
[38:03.380 --> 38:04.380]  You can't go wrong.
[38:04.380 --> 38:09.700]  In general, you can't go wrong thinking that, okay, Apple's going to make a blank.
[38:09.700 --> 38:12.860]  They're going to make a digital watch.
[38:12.860 --> 38:14.340]  How much is it going to cost?
[38:14.340 --> 38:18.380]  Well, however much you think most digital fitness watches cost, Apple's is going to
[38:18.380 --> 38:19.380]  cost more.
[38:19.380 --> 38:20.380]  You can't go wrong.
[38:20.380 --> 38:24.820]  So if they make a car, it's probably going to be expensive compared to regular average
[38:24.820 --> 38:25.820]  car.
[38:25.820 --> 38:26.820]  $170,000?
[38:26.820 --> 38:29.740]  No, that's a lot of money.
[38:29.740 --> 38:36.140]  Well, that's like when you sell a $10,000 digital watch, which didn't work.
[38:36.140 --> 38:37.140]  By the way, just let me say this.
[38:37.140 --> 38:40.160]  Nobody should quote me on that $170,000 thing.
[38:40.160 --> 38:41.220]  That's not even what I heard.
[38:41.220 --> 38:42.220]  I don't know.
[38:42.220 --> 38:46.420]  The number was it was really high, but don't even quote me that it was $170,000.
[38:46.420 --> 38:53.140]  But it was some kind of back of the envelope math and it was a six figure number.
[38:53.140 --> 38:57.860]  Yeah, well, put aside the edition models, right?
[38:57.860 --> 39:03.260]  Just forget that that's a wholly separate discussion, I think.
[39:03.260 --> 39:05.580]  Although it is, in my opinion, sort of embarrassing.
[39:05.580 --> 39:06.980]  I just wrote about it recently.
[39:06.980 --> 39:09.180]  Oh, I think it's completely embarrassing.
[39:09.180 --> 39:11.260]  I think it's one of their biggest failures ever.
[39:11.260 --> 39:12.260]  I have said this, though.
[39:12.260 --> 39:16.700]  I think that one of the smartest and best decisions, the strength that Apple has had
[39:16.700 --> 39:20.300]  is when they pivoted the watch from fashion to fitness.
[39:20.300 --> 39:26.260]  When they made that pivot in that second year, that saved the watch and made it into the
[39:26.260 --> 39:28.300]  massive success that it is now.
[39:28.300 --> 39:31.780]  But the first year, it was all about fashion and that was not the right way to go.
[39:31.780 --> 39:34.780]  Well, they had the fitness there, right?
[39:34.780 --> 39:37.740]  And they really emphasized at the beginning that they had three.
[39:37.740 --> 39:40.460]  I think we can tie this in with the car, but they had three.
[39:40.460 --> 39:47.060]  They were very clear that they had three models, the sport, the no name stainless steel one,
[39:47.060 --> 39:48.060]  and the edition.
[39:48.060 --> 39:49.060]  Right.
[39:49.060 --> 39:53.620]  And I remember arguing with people, and I'm not saying this just to pick up my being right
[39:53.620 --> 39:59.180]  points, but there were people who were arguing that the sport ones would cost more than the
[39:59.180 --> 40:00.260]  no name ones.
[40:00.260 --> 40:03.900]  They're like, oh, the no name one means it's the cheapest and the sport one.
[40:03.900 --> 40:04.900]  And it's like, no.
[40:04.900 --> 40:07.380]  I mean, how in the world would the aluminum one cost more?
[40:07.380 --> 40:08.380]  Exactly, right.
[40:08.380 --> 40:11.660]  And they're like, yeah, it's eye on glass, dude.
[40:11.660 --> 40:14.680]  And it's like, no, that's just a fancy way of saying it's glass.
[40:14.680 --> 40:16.220]  The other one's made of sapphire.
[40:16.220 --> 40:17.220]  Sapphire is better than glass.
[40:17.220 --> 40:20.420]  Eye on glass is just glass.
[40:20.420 --> 40:24.500]  They just put a word in front of glass.
[40:24.500 --> 40:27.180]  It's like, you don't know what you're talking about.
[40:27.180 --> 40:32.020]  And then I remember too telling people, I even wrote a thing, I was like, the gold ones
[40:32.020 --> 40:35.580]  are going to cost like $10,000 and people are like, you're out of your mind, they're
[40:35.580 --> 40:36.580]  going to...
[40:36.580 --> 40:37.580]  No, I remember that.
[40:37.580 --> 40:38.580]  I remember you being right on that.
[40:38.580 --> 40:39.580]  And you were dead on.
[40:39.580 --> 40:41.220]  And it was, but it was insane.
[40:41.220 --> 40:44.860]  I was low, if anything, because they went up to like $18,500.
[40:44.860 --> 40:48.420]  Yeah, no, it was insane.
[40:48.420 --> 40:54.860]  And it was completely, I think that was Apple, I think oftentimes is considered like a Hooper
[40:54.860 --> 40:55.860]  Stick company.
[40:55.860 --> 40:57.580]  And I don't think that's true.
[40:57.580 --> 41:01.060]  That I do think was like peak Hooper is just think that you could sell an $18,000 watch.
[41:01.060 --> 41:02.300]  It had to be Johnny.
[41:02.300 --> 41:05.740]  I mean, and I totally 100% I hate to do that.
[41:05.740 --> 41:09.100]  I hate to throw somebody under the rug, who's not even there anymore.
[41:09.100 --> 41:11.300]  But I mean, it had to be Johnny.
[41:11.300 --> 41:14.620]  I mean, it doesn't make any sense that it was anybody else.
[41:14.620 --> 41:16.940]  And no, of course, it was Johnny, because he's a watch guy.
[41:16.940 --> 41:20.580]  And he'd already done things like he was making those art installation of, you know, pieces
[41:20.580 --> 41:25.860]  with Mark, his buddy, his name I can't think of, last name I can't think of like they were
[41:25.860 --> 41:31.740]  already doing those sorts of really, really like high end one off kinds of things.
[41:31.740 --> 41:34.160]  They were already doing that kind of design work.
[41:34.160 --> 41:38.740]  So yeah, that was a completely Johnny thing, I have to think and I but I also do think
[41:38.740 --> 41:42.060]  it was a little bit of kind of a apple on top of the world thing thinking, yeah, we
[41:42.060 --> 41:47.860]  can sell $10,000 watches that will be unable to get a software update in two years.
[41:47.860 --> 41:49.500]  I do think it's an embarrassment.
[41:49.500 --> 41:54.420]  I do think it's, you know, even if even if Apple wants to spin it now and be like, oh,
[41:54.420 --> 41:56.860]  we only claim to make a handful.
[41:56.860 --> 42:02.620]  No, you productized it like you, you made it a part of of your promotional thing.
[42:02.620 --> 42:06.420]  Like you had an assembly line for it, even if you didn't assemble a lot of them, like
[42:06.420 --> 42:07.780]  you made this askew.
[42:07.780 --> 42:14.460]  This was not a thing that you made just a couple of variants of for very special people
[42:14.460 --> 42:18.260]  like this was something that was actually, you know, you had to get an appointment and
[42:18.260 --> 42:24.940]  you had in stores like this was a real thing and and it I was completely out of touch with
[42:24.940 --> 42:26.620]  reality in my opinion.
[42:26.620 --> 42:32.740]  It stands out to me because in my opinion, it's a fundamentally dishonest product product
[42:32.740 --> 42:41.260]  because if you buy a 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 dollar or more, I mean, you know, watches
[42:41.260 --> 42:48.300]  cost a lot, but if you buy a 30,000 dollar Rolex or a Patek, it is likely going to go
[42:48.300 --> 42:49.300]  up in value.
[42:49.300 --> 42:56.740]  I mean, especially in recent years, like the, you know, the high end find watch market is
[42:56.740 --> 43:00.780]  skyrocketing and you can't, it's hard to get your hands on a lot of the most popular stainless
[43:00.780 --> 43:08.460]  steel watches from Rolex and Patek and other companies.
[43:08.460 --> 43:14.720]  And you buy it now, you spend 10,000 dollars, you get a Rolex 10 years from now, it's probably
[43:14.720 --> 43:20.380]  gone up in value, but at the very least it is still just as good a watch as it was 10
[43:20.380 --> 43:21.380]  years before.
[43:21.380 --> 43:22.380]  Well, that's what I was going to say.
[43:22.380 --> 43:23.380]  It's going to last forever.
[43:23.380 --> 43:29.020]  Like my parents both have at this point, you know, 20 something year old Rolexes that were
[43:29.020 --> 43:33.820]  very expensive then and I think my mom even got like the face of hers, you know, redone
[43:33.820 --> 43:39.020]  or whatever, but they still work exactly as they did.
[43:39.020 --> 43:40.140]  They're in fantastic shape.
[43:40.140 --> 43:46.740]  And as you said, it, you know, my mom's might've even have gone up in value, you know, like
[43:46.740 --> 43:47.740]  it's one of those things.
[43:47.740 --> 43:48.740]  Yeah.
[43:48.740 --> 43:51.660]  You do have to, if you wear it regularly, you do need to get it serviced some number
[43:51.660 --> 43:52.660]  of years.
[43:52.660 --> 43:56.780]  But, but an official Rolex, the place where you bought it, if you buy it from an official
[43:56.780 --> 44:00.020]  retailer, they'll take gold care of you.
[44:00.020 --> 44:05.140]  I mean, they'll come in and if there's damage to it, if there's chips on the glass and on
[44:05.140 --> 44:08.900]  the Sapphire or whatever, they'll ask you, do you want it replaced or do you want to
[44:08.900 --> 44:12.420]  keep it because some people want to keep the original, even if it's damaged, you know,
[44:12.420 --> 44:14.540]  they'll, they won't touch it without your permission.
[44:14.540 --> 44:20.100]  But if you do want, you know, they'll, they'll replace parts and it'll work, you know, and
[44:20.100 --> 44:25.820]  you can hand it down to the next generation and that's what you get at a 10,000, $20,000
[44:25.820 --> 44:26.820]  watch level.
[44:26.820 --> 44:31.220]  The Apple watch lit, like you said, literally within two years, it wouldn't literally within
[44:31.220 --> 44:32.220]  two years.
[44:32.220 --> 44:33.540]  It was, it was completely useless.
[44:33.540 --> 44:34.540]  Right.
[44:34.540 --> 44:39.300]  The first generation Apple watch, the AKA series zero was kind of crappy technically
[44:39.300 --> 44:40.300]  too.
[44:40.300 --> 44:42.020]  It was very much like the first iPad, right?
[44:42.020 --> 44:47.620]  Not enough RAM, like a little bit slow processor, like just MVP.
[44:47.620 --> 44:49.820]  I would say it was the worst first generation product.
[44:49.820 --> 44:52.340]  I would say even the original iPad was a little better.
[44:52.340 --> 44:54.060]  Oh, I, no, I agree with that.
[44:54.060 --> 44:59.460]  I mean, I just meant in terms of like the guts, no, I think the iPad was a much, was
[44:59.460 --> 45:02.300]  actually a fantastic first generation product.
[45:02.300 --> 45:05.300]  But yeah, I agree with that, I think it was probably the worst first gen product.
[45:05.300 --> 45:10.100]  I think it's the first one and the only one that really comes to mind where they do a
[45:10.100 --> 45:15.220]  great job that they're obviously a company of perfectionists and there's a part of them.
[45:15.220 --> 45:19.660]  Everybody works at Apple who would love to just go away for 20 years to work on something
[45:19.660 --> 45:23.220]  and then come out with it, but you can't, you have to ship and they're very, very good
[45:23.220 --> 45:24.220]  at shipping.
[45:24.220 --> 45:28.660]  So you kind of have to ship a little too early because if you don't, if you don't purposefully
[45:28.660 --> 45:31.400]  ship a little too early, you're going to ship a little too late.
[45:31.400 --> 45:33.700]  And that's very dangerous.
[45:33.700 --> 45:37.500]  I think that Apple watch is the one where they shipped at least a year too early.
[45:37.500 --> 45:41.460]  And I think, you know, you can't blame them because there was this, you know, it was the
[45:41.460 --> 45:43.580]  first product post Steve jobs.
[45:43.580 --> 45:48.900]  The company was withering under a wall street speculation that they'd never have another
[45:48.900 --> 45:50.380]  product after Steve jobs.
[45:50.380 --> 45:55.100]  And so you can't blame them for maybe, maybe it had been leaked so much, right?
[45:55.100 --> 45:58.620]  Like at that point she would have been leaked so much and it was too early.
[45:58.620 --> 45:59.980]  It was, I, I'd felt that too.
[45:59.980 --> 46:04.660]  I felt like they didn't have the apps ready, they didn't have the SDK ready, they didn't
[46:04.660 --> 46:06.620]  have that story done.
[46:06.620 --> 46:10.220]  And they did like in the, like it was released in March and then it came out in the fall
[46:10.220 --> 46:13.740]  and in March seemed late, like it seemed to me like they had wanted to release it the
[46:13.740 --> 46:15.940]  previous fall and it just wasn't even there.
[46:15.940 --> 46:22.940]  And it took until, you know, the following fall for it really to be viable.
[46:22.940 --> 46:26.100]  And yeah, it was too early.
[46:26.100 --> 46:30.060]  Yeah, the series one or series two, I guess, right?
[46:30.060 --> 46:36.420]  Cause series one was the sort of retconned, like they, yeah, like they, they, they took
[46:36.420 --> 46:40.580]  the guts, the other one, but, but gave it a better processor so you could actually upgrade
[46:40.580 --> 46:41.580]  it, right?
[46:41.580 --> 46:45.500]  The series zero was so bad that they wouldn't even do the typical Tim Cook era thing of
[46:45.500 --> 46:48.020]  selling the year old version at a lower price, right?
[46:48.020 --> 46:49.020]  It was so slow.
[46:49.020 --> 46:50.020]  No, exactly.
[46:50.020 --> 46:53.820]  Which, which, which for me is someone who spent $850 on a watch.
[46:53.820 --> 46:54.820]  I was pretty angry.
[46:54.820 --> 46:56.660]  I didn't get another one until a series three.
[46:56.660 --> 46:57.660]  Like I, I sat it out.
[46:57.660 --> 47:01.740]  I was like, no, you're not getting my money because I'm like mad.
[47:01.740 --> 47:08.220]  If you spent 400 to 800, $900, I think they went, I think $1,100 got you the stainless
[47:08.220 --> 47:12.580]  steel one with the, the steel link bracelet.
[47:12.580 --> 47:14.180]  Yeah, I believe so.
[47:14.180 --> 47:15.180]  Which I bought.
[47:15.180 --> 47:20.100]  And my link bracelet from my original series zero is still impeccable, no scratches cause
[47:20.100 --> 47:23.780]  I got the DLC coating, which is amazing.
[47:23.780 --> 47:27.180]  So they were, you know, it was proof that they could do a lot of the things with watches
[47:27.180 --> 47:28.180]  really, really good.
[47:28.180 --> 47:31.500]  The thing that wasn't very good was the computer inside.
[47:31.500 --> 47:36.280]  And I remember, and so you spent, you know, 400 to $1,000 where you got what you paid
[47:36.280 --> 47:37.280]  for.
[47:37.280 --> 47:38.280]  You were an early adopter.
[47:38.280 --> 47:39.540]  You bought the first one.
[47:39.540 --> 47:43.500]  If you spent $15,000 on the gold one, you got ripped off.
[47:43.500 --> 47:44.500]  100%.
[47:44.500 --> 47:48.540]  Like I would be, even if I had that much money, I would be pissed.
[47:48.540 --> 47:51.760]  I think honestly, there'd be no way that I couldn't be right.
[47:51.760 --> 47:55.260]  And I know that there were a lot of people when it, when it, when I said it's going to
[47:55.260 --> 48:01.660]  cost like five to $10,000 for gold, because that's just what all gold fine watches cost.
[48:01.660 --> 48:02.660]  People are like, you're nuts.
[48:02.660 --> 48:03.660]  It's going to be outdated.
[48:03.660 --> 48:05.780]  And I'm like, it might be outdated.
[48:05.780 --> 48:07.460]  I didn't tell them to make a gold watch.
[48:07.460 --> 48:10.620]  I'm telling you what good gold watches cost.
[48:10.620 --> 48:14.740]  And then when the prices did come out and I was right, people wrote to me and they're
[48:14.740 --> 48:16.060]  like, Hey, good call.
[48:16.060 --> 48:19.940]  I'll bet what they're going to do is when you buy an addition watch, when they come
[48:19.940 --> 48:23.420]  out with new ones, you'll be able to take it to the Apple store and turn your series
[48:23.420 --> 48:25.220]  zero into a series two.
[48:25.220 --> 48:28.940]  And then two years later you could turn it into a series three and you know, drop it
[48:28.940 --> 48:31.940]  off and three days later, pick it up and it'll have new guts.
[48:31.940 --> 48:35.940]  And I was like, uh, no, computers don't work like that.
[48:35.940 --> 48:36.940]  Right, right.
[48:36.940 --> 48:38.700]  No, they don't.
[48:38.700 --> 48:42.160]  And, and companies have tried like, like every time they've tried to do those upgrade things
[48:42.160 --> 48:45.980]  like Samsung tried with their TVs and whatnot, like they usually abandon it after a couple
[48:45.980 --> 48:46.980]  of years.
[48:46.980 --> 48:50.500]  And that's not a way that you can really unfortunately make modern electronics.
[48:50.500 --> 48:51.500]  Right.
[48:51.500 --> 48:52.500]  It just doesn't work.
[48:52.500 --> 48:53.500]  The tolerances are too small.
[48:53.500 --> 48:58.340]  So I would just call it fundamentally dishonest and, you know, and, and everything they've
[48:58.340 --> 49:00.380]  done since to me has corrected it.
[49:00.380 --> 49:05.060]  Even the ones that they call addition, like the titanium one, which I bought a couple
[49:05.060 --> 49:10.600]  of years ago for the series five and which I love the ceramic ones that they came out
[49:10.600 --> 49:16.500]  with, which I think were like, I forget how much they cost, like a thousand dollars, maybe
[49:16.500 --> 49:22.700]  1500, something like that, reasonable as an upper bound for, and the other thing too is
[49:22.700 --> 49:27.300]  once they, especially once they got to series three, that the technology of them was good
[49:27.300 --> 49:30.740]  enough that you could, you could let, they last for years, you know, you could use it
[49:30.740 --> 49:36.100]  for three, four, five years, which again does not compare to a mechanical watch, but no,
[49:36.100 --> 49:39.580]  but, but it makes you feel, I mean, but it puts it in line with like a smartphone or
[49:39.580 --> 49:40.580]  an iPad or something else.
[49:40.580 --> 49:42.580]  Like you feel like you're still getting value out of it.
[49:42.580 --> 49:47.340]  Like I get a fitness credit, that's now been expanded to some other things, but I get like
[49:47.340 --> 49:51.820]  a fitness credit every year through work and I've used it to buy a new stainless steel
[49:51.820 --> 49:57.060]  Apple watch every year that I've been at Microsoft and I haven't needed to actually upgrade,
[49:57.060 --> 50:02.500]  but I've just done it anyway and then given my old one to a friend or, or, or whatever.
[50:02.500 --> 50:06.660]  I'm probably not going to do that for the series six, I probably should have just kept
[50:06.660 --> 50:11.500]  the series five to be honest, but I needed to, it's free money, I needed to use it and
[50:11.500 --> 50:16.340]  um, this year I'm able to use the money for different things, so I am more than likely
[50:16.340 --> 50:17.340]  doing that.
[50:17.340 --> 50:21.220]  But, um, I feel like I could probably still be using, you know, they were still into thing
[50:21.220 --> 50:22.220]  until recently.
[50:22.220 --> 50:24.180]  They might even still be selling the series three, right?
[50:24.180 --> 50:28.100]  Like, yeah, I think that's their low end price right now.
[50:28.100 --> 50:29.100]  Right.
[50:29.100 --> 50:31.860]  So, so that is to me, and they make that super affordable.
[50:31.860 --> 50:37.420]  So to me like that is actually, okay, you buy this and you're getting, you know, um,
[50:37.420 --> 50:38.420]  four years out of it or so.
[50:38.420 --> 50:43.300]  Like that's, that's pretty good, uh, especially if you're not spending, if you're spending,
[50:43.300 --> 50:47.580]  you know, $350 for it or something like that and you wear it every day and it's this thing
[50:47.580 --> 50:52.360]  that's more than just your watch, but it's this, this health device too that is really
[50:52.360 --> 50:53.700]  indispensable for a lot of people.
[50:53.700 --> 50:58.220]  I feel like the value point is there because Fitbits and things like that, which aren't
[50:58.220 --> 51:02.180]  that much less expensive when you get into the higher end, um, especially if you look
[51:02.180 --> 51:07.300]  at like the starting price of the lowest end Apple watches, people have the same things
[51:07.300 --> 51:10.260]  where after a few years they need to get another one.
[51:10.260 --> 51:12.900]  So I think that's completely fine.
[51:12.900 --> 51:17.900]  It's just, you know, and if you are that person who's spinning stuff on the Hermes, uh, you
[51:17.900 --> 51:23.120]  know, um, band or wanting to get one of the, um, you know, ceramic or the titanium ones
[51:23.120 --> 51:27.820]  or whatever the case may be, like you go into that knowing, okay, this is not a forever
[51:27.820 --> 51:32.140]  thing, but I'm paying a premium because I like this styling or I want this type of band.
[51:32.140 --> 51:33.140]  Fine.
[51:33.140 --> 51:34.140]  Yeah.
[51:34.140 --> 51:38.500]  I mean, I just looked at series three is the one that starts at one 99 and I think you
[51:38.500 --> 51:41.940]  add 30 bucks to get the, the bigger size.
[51:41.940 --> 51:46.660]  Um, and you know, clearly it sticks out a little bit cause the series four is when they
[51:46.660 --> 51:50.540]  went to the slightly different form factor and it's obvious what they're going to do
[51:50.540 --> 51:51.540]  come September.
[51:51.540 --> 51:57.840]  They'll come out with series seven, the series three goes away and the, uh, Apple watch se
[51:57.840 --> 51:59.420]  becomes that low end model.
[51:59.420 --> 52:01.520]  That's what se means in Apple parlance.
[52:01.520 --> 52:07.340]  It means a low end price based on like two year old technology or 18 month old technology
[52:07.340 --> 52:13.020]  and it sticks around for two to three years at that low end price.
[52:13.020 --> 52:14.020]  Right?
[52:14.020 --> 52:18.700]  Like the, the, the phone that they call the iPhone se right now, the iPhone se two, that's
[52:18.700 --> 52:20.540]  going to be here for years.
[52:20.540 --> 52:21.540]  Yeah.
[52:21.540 --> 52:23.580]  Because the other se was here for years.
[52:23.580 --> 52:24.580]  It was here for years.
[52:24.580 --> 52:28.780]  And I mean it was, yeah, and you know, people are still sad that that form factor went away
[52:28.780 --> 52:29.780]  actually.
[52:29.780 --> 52:30.780]  Yeah.
[52:30.780 --> 52:31.780]  Yeah.
[52:31.780 --> 52:35.700]  No, I think that now actually they are in a good place pricing wise, but originally,
[52:35.700 --> 52:43.460]  yeah, it was, it was a failure, but kind of going back to the car, I mean, I guess this
[52:43.460 --> 52:46.660]  is sort of like my question that was like, you know, you, you could understand like the
[52:46.660 --> 52:50.580]  rumors were there around like watches and you could see that there was a lot of tech
[52:50.580 --> 52:54.380]  happening in the wearable space and it makes sense for Apple to be there.
[52:54.380 --> 52:59.940]  And I guess there is a ton of tech happening in the self driving space, but I still have
[52:59.940 --> 53:05.700]  a hard time, especially if we're talking about a potentially six figure plus like starting
[53:05.700 --> 53:06.700]  price.
[53:06.700 --> 53:12.300]  Like, okay, Tesla does most of their cars once you get all in, are going to be around
[53:12.300 --> 53:13.300]  that.
[53:13.300 --> 53:16.960]  Same thing is going to be true for, you know, a Mercedes or BMW, but those aren't their
[53:16.960 --> 53:17.960]  only options.
[53:17.960 --> 53:21.580]  Like even Tesla now, you know, they have an option, obviously once you spec it out, you're
[53:21.580 --> 53:28.140]  not spending under $50,000, but you know, on paper you can get in for half of what if
[53:28.140 --> 53:34.060]  we're being very generous, it seems like would have been your price to get into the Apple
[53:34.060 --> 53:35.620]  car ecosystem.
[53:35.620 --> 53:37.900]  I just, I just don't understand.
[53:37.900 --> 53:42.300]  I think this is my struggle is like, not that I don't think Apple could make a fantastic
[53:42.300 --> 53:47.260]  user interface for a car and that it wouldn't be an amazing experience.
[53:47.260 --> 53:50.860]  I just don't know why Apple is a company wants to be in the car business.
[53:50.860 --> 53:51.860]  Yeah.
[53:51.860 --> 53:54.580]  Let me put it to you this way and see if you agree.
[53:54.580 --> 54:01.660]  Even the watch is primarily a computer.
[54:01.660 --> 54:07.420]  And you know, Apple put a lot of work they've done, I mean, really as a watch nerd outside
[54:07.420 --> 54:11.380]  Apple watch, one of the most amazing things they've done is what they've done with band
[54:11.380 --> 54:18.660]  designs across the board from the sport band that is sort of the default band to the link
[54:18.660 --> 54:22.380]  bracelet and the way that you can just adjust it and take links out with your fingernail
[54:22.380 --> 54:26.980]  instead of any kind of fancy tools, the leather stuff.
[54:26.980 --> 54:28.860]  They're really nice bands.
[54:28.860 --> 54:29.940]  And yeah, they are.
[54:29.940 --> 54:30.940]  They are.
[54:30.940 --> 54:37.180]  The only criticism I have is I got the the light pink, I guess, what the fancy buckle
[54:37.180 --> 54:38.180]  thing was.
[54:38.180 --> 54:41.100]  And that that that didn't hold up super well.
[54:41.100 --> 54:42.100]  It got dirty.
[54:42.100 --> 54:45.260]  I mean, I was able to clean it, but it just was one of those things that was like, yeah,
[54:45.260 --> 54:48.540]  you know, it showed it should just wear.
[54:48.540 --> 54:52.580]  But still, fundamentally, the basic idea of the Apple Watch is it's a tiny computer on
[54:52.580 --> 54:53.580]  your wrist.
[54:53.580 --> 54:55.460]  Yeah, that's the main thing it is.
[54:55.460 --> 55:01.580]  And the watch parts of it, like buckling and, you know, telling the time are all sort of
[55:01.580 --> 55:07.620]  secondary to the computer type parts, whereas a car, no matter how much of it is computerized,
[55:07.620 --> 55:13.580]  right, and, you know, Tesla has shown clearly, you know, lead led the way with putting a
[55:13.580 --> 55:18.660]  big, big computer display as the dashboard interface.
[55:18.660 --> 55:20.020]  100%.
[55:20.020 --> 55:26.540]  You know, so the dashboard console, the whole thing, you could certainly imagine how Apple
[55:26.540 --> 55:31.580]  would want to design that and would enjoy designing that.
[55:31.580 --> 55:35.140]  But the main part of the car is not the dashboard, right?
[55:35.140 --> 55:36.140]  Right.
[55:36.140 --> 55:39.500]  It's the actual driving of the car car.
[55:39.500 --> 55:43.100]  Yeah, I, you know, and that's, you know, that is the big
[55:43.100 --> 55:50.380]  difference to me with the car with every other product, both existing and rumored that Apple's
[55:50.380 --> 55:56.540]  ever made, you know, the all the VR AR stuff is to me exactly like the watch, right, where
[55:56.540 --> 56:03.960]  it's fundamentally a computer and secondarily something else, right, like even the especially
[56:03.960 --> 56:11.440]  the one that supposedly is coming first, the $3,000 according to the information VR headset
[56:11.440 --> 56:14.540]  with two 8K displays, it's a computer.
[56:14.540 --> 56:18.280]  And so put aside where they're, Oh, my God, $3,000, blah, blah, blah.
[56:18.280 --> 56:20.080]  It's still it's a computer.
[56:20.080 --> 56:22.140]  And that's exactly what Apple's always made.
[56:22.140 --> 56:24.920]  They used to be called Apple computer.
[56:24.920 --> 56:32.540]  And even the supposedly after that AR glasses that you would wear all day, that would project
[56:32.540 --> 56:37.780]  some sort of heads up display in front of you to computer device and fashion second
[56:37.780 --> 56:42.780]  where, you know, whatever the Apple glasses look like, you know, Apple's design prowess
[56:42.780 --> 56:46.500]  and taste would certainly you would think help in that regard in the same way it did
[56:46.500 --> 56:51.540]  with the watch where people like wearing the Apple watch and think it looks good on their
[56:51.540 --> 56:52.820]  wrist.
[56:52.820 --> 56:54.460]  Car is very different.
[56:54.460 --> 57:00.620]  I don't know I so one idea would be the cynical idea.
[57:00.620 --> 57:05.300]  Why would they do this is well, there's a lot of money to be made making cars so we
[57:05.300 --> 57:07.980]  should make a car.
[57:07.980 --> 57:15.080]  The non cynical answer would be that they have one or more ideas to redefine the car
[57:15.080 --> 57:22.120]  market and think, you know, that they're on to something that no one else is thinking
[57:22.120 --> 57:27.340]  about or, or no one else could do, they might think, and therefore they're going to do it.
[57:27.340 --> 57:28.860]  But I don't know what those ideas are.
[57:28.860 --> 57:31.940]  I don't, you know, they're not in my imagination.
[57:31.940 --> 57:38.300]  Yeah, I mean, and it I guess I guess the hard thing I have to kind of square with it is,
[57:38.300 --> 57:39.860]  yeah, maybe they feel like they can do something.
[57:39.860 --> 57:45.940]  But if I look at what Apple's strengths are, and they have many, I like to be totally candid
[57:45.940 --> 57:52.660]  like transportation, navigation, not one of them, right, like AI in general, I don't actually
[57:52.660 --> 57:54.180]  think is one of their strengths.
[57:54.180 --> 57:58.460]  And I don't mean that with disrespect, it's just that the way that Apple cares about privacy,
[57:58.460 --> 58:03.220]  and the things that they put forward, work at a disadvantage to them, I think, with their
[58:03.220 --> 58:07.540]  systems compared to the models from the other big tech companies.
[58:07.540 --> 58:08.540]  So
[58:08.540 --> 58:16.100]  I think I wrote about that recently with one of my continuing series of goofy, you know,
[58:16.100 --> 58:19.580]  instances with Siri giving nonsensical answers to things.
[58:19.580 --> 58:25.400]  I mean, the one I just posted the other day was I said, Hey, dingus, remind me to pick
[58:25.400 --> 58:32.140]  up the dry cleaning Wednesday at three, which in fact was today.
[58:32.140 --> 58:37.980]  And Siri said a reminder for me at 3am to pick up the dry cleaning.
[58:37.980 --> 58:45.000]  And I posted, you know, posted what I said, which was, hey, dingus, pick up the dry cleaning
[58:45.000 --> 58:46.000]  at three.
[58:46.000 --> 58:51.820]  And I wasn't trying to be obstinate, and I wasn't trying to stress test it.
[58:51.820 --> 58:58.840]  And yes, most of the time when I speak to Siri, and I do speak to Siri a lot, you know,
[58:58.840 --> 58:59.900]  it works.
[58:59.900 --> 59:06.380]  But every time it jumps out in a nonsensical way, it is, it's the needle scratching on
[59:06.380 --> 59:08.020]  a record.
[59:08.020 --> 59:10.860]  And this one, you know, it makes no sense.
[59:10.860 --> 59:15.940]  And I know, I think I wrote longer about it, like, I think it was Neelay Patel, who had
[59:15.940 --> 59:18.980]  the thing about, hey, what time is it in London?
[59:18.980 --> 59:24.980]  And it gave the time for like, London, Ontario.
[59:24.980 --> 59:34.520]  And my explanation of this was, look, the baseline is what would a human assistant do?
[59:34.520 --> 59:40.180]  And if you had a human assistant, who you hired, and you said, hey, what time can you
[59:40.180 --> 59:43.000]  find out what time it is right now in London?
[59:43.000 --> 59:48.320]  And they returned, they gave you the time in London, Ontario, you honestly, and I don't
[59:48.320 --> 59:53.300]  mean this to exaggerate, you would immediately have to think I might have to fire this assistant
[59:53.300 --> 59:57.180]  because this person is too stupid to have the job.
[59:57.180 --> 59:58.180]  Yeah.
[59:58.180 --> 01:00:02.460]  No, and the same thing for setting like a reminder for you to get your dry cleaning
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:03.460]  at 3am.
[01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:04.460]  Right.
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:09.660]  Here's the funny part about that is there's a clip, somebody sent me a clip and they're
[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:12.020]  like, do you remember Mitch Hedberg, the comedian?
[01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:13.020]  Yeah.
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:15.020]  Unfortunately, he died a few years ago.
[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:20.740]  But he actually had a bit about, he was on Letterman, and I'm not going to do it justice
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:21.740]  because he's so great.
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:28.900]  But he said, I was walking down the street one night and there was a dry, I walked past
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:34.060]  the dry, literally a dry cleaner and it said, and it was 3am and they had a sign on the
[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:36.220]  door and it said closed.
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:39.300]  And I'm like, you don't need to tell me that at 3am.
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:40.300]  I know.
[01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:44.420]  And it's like, holy cow, it wasn't just any business.
[01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:45.420]  It was a dry cleaner.
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:48.100]  The time was three.
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:50.700]  That's crazy.
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:57.340]  You would honestly think about a human being, this person is like mentally insufficient
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:00.700]  to do the job as my personal assistant.
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:04.220]  How can I trust this person if they're going to make mistakes like this?
[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:05.220]  Right.
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:10.020]  And again, it's not a joke because they're talking about making a car, right?
[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:11.820]  This isn't like a joke.
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:14.160]  I mean, yes, exactly.
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:22.860]  I mean, and even though Apple Maps has gotten better, it's not as good as Google Maps.
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:23.860]  It's not even close.
[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:26.940]  Well, it's not as good as a taxi driver, right?
[01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:35.020]  I mean, the baseline is you get into a Lyft or a taxi and you say, drive me to 30th Street
[01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:36.740]  train station.
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:40.300]  You expect to get a reasonable route directly to...
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:45.900]  I use Apple Maps and I think it's pretty good.
[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:46.900]  But is it...
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:50.020]  Yeah, I use it too, although it did get me stuck on a mountain once, but that's a whole
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:51.020]  other thing.
[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:52.020]  But yeah.
[01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:53.020]  Is it good enough?
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:54.020]  I don't know.
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:55.780]  Is it good enough to drive the car around?
[01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:56.780]  I don't know.
[01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:57.780]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:00.980]  If I'm being completely candid, I mean, and I don't drive.
[01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:04.340]  So the idea of a self-driving car actually greatly appeals to me.
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:08.140]  And I would even be someone who would be willing to spend a premium on that if there was like
[01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:11.700]  a truly self-driving car thing where I didn't have to be behind the wheel at all and do
[01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:12.700]  any of it.
[01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:16.660]  But I'm going to need to have trust in the system that it's going to get me where I need
[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:19.540]  to go, that it's going to understand things.
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:26.740]  And from a pure navigation standpoint, I don't have that in Apple Maps.
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:32.540]  And the sad thing is that I have no doubt that there are people and systems and engineers
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:36.860]  at Apple who could make a system that I could have full trust in.
[01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:39.100]  Just like how Siri is different on different devices.
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:44.740]  I find that it's actually quite good on Apple TV, but it's terrible in a lot of other places.
[01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:46.500]  It's highly kind of context dependent.
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.460]  But the problem is that it's always called the same thing.
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:59.900]  So if I'm in an Apple car that has Apple Maps in it with its Apple Drive system or whatever,
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:04.980]  I'm going to be pretty skeptical that I can trust it to get me from point A to point B
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:10.460]  without either taking me the wrong way, you know, that's going to waste me more time or
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:15.260]  worst case scenario, get me, you know, stuck on a mountain.
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:22.140]  I'll take an aside here and say that I'm deeply skeptical about true self driving cars, meaning
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:27.300]  that you could truly just get in the car, tell the car where to go and fall asleep and
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:34.000]  not be completely cognizant as somebody being the driver cognizant ready to go.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:41.140]  And furthermore, I'm also very, very skeptical of Tesla style current Tesla feature availability
[01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:44.180]  of you can mostly trust it.
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:47.340]  I actually think that's the worst to be totally honest, right?
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:51.340]  Because it gives it gives people like they feel like they can trust it and and they don't
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:54.620]  take the precautions that they should.
[01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:57.020]  I'm terrified of getting into car accidents.
[01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:00.800]  I'm generally I'm perhaps even slightly phobic about it.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:08.420]  I do drive and and but I I find like the current rate of the number of people who get into
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:14.460]  either deadly or very, very seriously injured car accidents on a daily basis terrifying.
[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:19.300]  I typically walk everywhere in Philadelphia, I'm every single time I see someone who's
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:23.420]  obviously on their phone while they're driving a car, I'm enraged.
[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:29.020]  I would like to have an entire second police force whose job is to do nothing but identify
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:34.020]  people who are on their phone while driving because I'm terrified by it I drive honest
[01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:38.820]  to God would rather have people drinking and driving than texting and driving because at
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:42.220]  least when you're drinking and driving, you're looking at the road and you're thinking I
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:46.460]  should I've had you know, too much to drink and you know, honest to God, that's how bad
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:48.700]  I think you're more impaired.
[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:50.860]  I don't think I'm not trying to say you should drink and drive.
[01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:53.260]  I'm saying no, no, I mean, well, studies have shown that you're right.
[01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:58.340]  I mean, studies have actually shown that maybe not more but certainly as impaired texting
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:03.820]  and driving has shown that so I don't think you're wrong there and I'm actually very critical
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:09.980]  of Tesla's model because it creates this false sense of trust that you don't have.
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:12.780]  You can't possibly keep your attention.
[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:18.580]  No, no, and even worse, you know, Tesla claims that they don't promote it, but they do.
[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:22.660]  There's the wink and the nudge of all the things that you can do and that I think is
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:26.140]  really dangerous because it's the same thing like the reason that we have people who text
[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:31.700]  and drive are because, you know, people felt like they can multitask and they can do those
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:36.500]  things and it's become deadly and millions and millions of people have died that way
[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:42.780]  and I worry, I'm with you like look, like long term I think that we might get to a point
[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:44.100]  where we get up truly self-driving cars.
[01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:49.380]  I don't know if we'll see it in our lifetimes or not, but I feel like it is a ways off,
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:57.020]  but I do have like actually I think that the assisted but we're so good you can trust
[01:05:57.020 --> 01:06:00.740]  it to be unassisted model is the most dangerous thing.
[01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:06.500]  Like I would much more prefer the models of the self-driving technology that require,
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:12.380]  you know, hands to be on the wheel and that require like eyes to be focused on the road
[01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:17.980]  and that sort of thing for the systems to work than what Tesla does.
[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:19.220]  I really do agree with that.
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:24.700]  One time, a couple of years ago, I got invited to, I never ended up writing about it or at
[01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:25.700]  least not much.
[01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:29.780]  I didn't write the feature that I probably should have, but I got invited to Mercedes
[01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:37.980]  not a headquarters, but they're like, I forget if it was in San Jose, where's Yahoo's headquarters?
[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:38.980]  Sunnyville.
[01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:39.980]  Sunnyville.
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:45.540]  I think that's where Mercedes has a big self-driving car installation in Silicon Valley and I got
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:50.660]  invited there in the media to do like see their self-driving stuff and I took a ride
[01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:54.500]  in a self-driving Mercedes vehicle.
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:07:00.620]  I was paired up with Mark Bergen who's at Recode and so Mark and I were in the back
[01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:02.100]  seat of a Mercedes.
[01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:06.200]  There was a press person in the passenger seat and then there was one of their engineers
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:09.460]  behind the wheel and it was very impressive.
[01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:15.300]  I mean, and the car really did do pretty much all the driving and we went from the parking
[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:21.300]  lot at their office to out in the highway for a bit and came back and the car did just
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:22.820]  about everything.
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:25.980]  It got confused on the on-ramp to the highway.
[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:30.780]  It had to go a little bit uphill and it was right into the sun and it just sort of froze
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:37.900]  up and the car braked, like tended to brake everywhere like a student driver, meaning
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:42.460]  that like your head would go forward, you know, like it got stopped short, but the car
[01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:45.580]  really did do the driving and it was impressive.
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:50.380]  But it's just to not have somebody behind the wheel, forget about it.
[01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:57.020]  And I think that the industry will quickly get to the point where in theory you could
[01:07:57.020 --> 01:08:03.940]  have a closed circuit, like your own little city, and if you banned all human drivers
[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:10.740]  and only allowed cars that were autonomous and talk to each other, that would work.
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:11.740]  I think we'll get there.
[01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:12.740]  I agree.
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:13.740]  They could do that today.
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:17.100]  The problem is have mixing the autonomous cars with the human drivers.
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:18.100]  No, I agree with you.
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:19.100]  I agree with you.
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:20.100]  It's funny.
[01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:23.340]  It is about four years ago now, but I actually made a very similar argument when I was at
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:29.020]  the New York Auto Show on a panel about self-driving cars and I had to, you know, in front of all
[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:33.300]  these corners, I was like, I don't have a driver's license, but let me tell you my thoughts.
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:38.020]  And that was kind of exactly my thought is that it's got to be the mixed thing.
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:42.700]  It's going to be really hard to make it truly autonomous and make it work.
[01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:48.880]  Whereas if you mandated, you know, it can only be self-driving cars.
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:53.700]  And then you have, you know, like IoT run, you know, 5G, you know, whatever running like
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:59.060]  traffic lights and sending other data signals and whatnot to control traffic flow.
[01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:06.180]  I think that could work pretty well, but the United States is not going to be the best
[01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:10.220]  place for that for lots of reasons, but it's possible we might see it in parts of Asia.
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:11.460]  I don't know.
[01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:15.900]  So part of that United States thing, we've learned this lesson over the last year.
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:20.180]  Americans tend to be very stubborn.
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:25.260]  I was going to say, yeah, I mean, look, our independence is our greatest feature and our
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:30.700]  greatest like weakness, to be totally honest, is our need for autonomy in that way.
[01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:36.060]  So part of the Mercedes thing, it was time well spent and I was very interested and it
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:41.540]  was a good presentation, but my question during one of the briefings was, okay, let's say
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:48.940]  we get to fully, you know, stage four, I forget what was, there's like a standard one, two,
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:52.940]  three, four, and maybe five, but four or five is like fully autonomous.
[01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:53.940]  It's Kit, right?
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:54.940]  It's Kit from Knight Rider.
[01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:59.460]  And you just say, Kit, take me to the airport.
[01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:05.300]  And you could sit in the backseat and Kit will drive you to the airport.
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:10.260]  And then at the like stage below that, where it's like the driver can kind of like, you
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:14.340]  have to have a driver, but you can kind of like not pay attention.
[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:18.540]  And it'll like beep at you if you need to take over and you have a couple seconds.
[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:25.380]  Even at that stage, my question was, okay, you're in a car and you're behind the wheel,
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:31.060]  but the car takes over and you're going somewhere, will you be allowed to exceed the speed limit?
[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:44.180]  And it was, I knew I had a good question because they paused and they said, no, that was the
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:46.060]  whole full answer.
[01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:52.140]  And you know, that is honestly, that alone is not going to fly in the United States.
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:56.100]  You know, the idea that you're on a road with a 65 mile an hour speed limit and your car
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:57.580]  will not go 66.
[01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:58.580]  Right.
[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:03.420]  Well, and more to the point, there are places where even if the limit is 65, the flow of
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:05.260]  traffic is 75.
[01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:08.100]  And if you're going 65, it could actually be dangerous.
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:13.420]  Like if you're trying to get off the interstate or something like it could actually be a problem.
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:17.100]  I joke about driving fast on this podcast many times over the years.
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:22.580]  And I do, when I do drive, I do like to drive fast on the highway.
[01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:25.380]  But it is true that no joke about it.
[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:31.780]  Getting the speed limit on a lot of highway, you know, with good, you know, flowing traffic,
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:32.780]  it's dangerous.
[01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:37.780]  It is dangerous to go 65 on a lot of roads or 55 or whatever the speed limit is.
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:39.300]  It is.
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.780]  But the cars won't end, you know, for logical reasons.
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:48.140]  And presumably, you know, 50, 60 years from now, you know, if we're still driving cars
[01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:53.300]  at all, they'll all be autonomous and they'll be able to go 120 miles an hour, you know,
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:54.740]  because it'll be fantastic.
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:58.260]  Like if you ever see like little animations of like what cars could do.
[01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:02.260]  If every car was autonomous, the way you'd be able to like zip through intersections.
[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:03.260]  Right.
[01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:04.260]  Yeah.
[01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:05.260]  No, it'd be incredible.
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:06.260]  Yeah.
[01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:09.900]  Well, I mean, I think that's kind of my secondary thing too, aside from maybe some of the logistical
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:13.380]  things or whatnot is like, okay, I maybe get the appeal.
[01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:18.140]  Like I get the appeal for a lot of companies, not Apple investing in self-driving tech and
[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:23.180]  maybe investing in, you know, the tech where you want to be the brains of what the self-driving
[01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:26.940]  cars are for other people, if you're like a very strong infrastructure play.
[01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:27.940]  Right.
[01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:30.420]  Like where your whole thing is, you want people using your stuff.
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:31.820]  That's typically not Apple's thing, though.
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:33.300]  They like to make their own things.
[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:36.660]  They don't really like to power like other people's stuff.
[01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:41.500]  Like as great as the M1 is and as amazing things that they've done with that, I don't
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:46.940]  really like, and Intel is fucked for a lot of reasons, but I don't feel like Apple can
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:49.780]  take on Intel in volume, nor would they want to.
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:50.780]  Right.
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:55.740]  So, I look at the car and I think, okay, so why do this?
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:13:01.300]  This is going to be, we know, a high price project.
[01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:06.620]  It requires engineering resources and expertise that, not to say Apple couldn't hire for that,
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:11.060]  but certainly that is not part of their instinctive DNA.
[01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:15.740]  And then I look kind of long term like, okay, if you're investing in this, it just seems
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:20.300]  to me, and I know I must be missing something, but I feel like, would it not be better to
[01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:27.460]  be looking at like high speed rail or bullet trains or other types of transportation that
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:29.140]  way rather than cars?
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:37.660]  Like why cars, which seem to be electric, EV aside, you know, globally, it's going to
[01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:42.780]  be something that all predictions seem to indicate is going to be on the decline.
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:43.780]  I don't know.
[01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:48.900]  You know, it is, and again, you know, it's, I could see why they don't get into trains
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:50.820]  because trains require the government, right?
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:54.600]  You cannot, you can't build the train tracks, although, you know, Elon Musk has tried to
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:14:00.980]  propose building a, what, a tunnel between Los Angeles and San Francisco, right?
[01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:01.980]  The hyperloop.
[01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:03.700]  Oh, I mean, I love it.
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:04.700]  I would too.
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:05.700]  I laugh.
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:08.540]  You know, please, I hope he does it.
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:11.620]  I seriously put me in the tube, but like, I would love that, that'd be amazing.
[01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:14.220]  I know he's building, I know, you know, the rocket ships work.
[01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:19.220]  I mean, so I'm not, I'm not laughing that he, that it can't be done, but you know, at
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:25.020]  least a car is, you know, something, somebody, they could just sell and you meet the regulatory
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:28.300]  requirements and then people can just buy it and they can just drive on the road.
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:33.100]  But whatever it is, I guarantee you this, I mean, whatever my, however wrong my pessimistic
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:37.740]  take on true autonomy is, if the rumors are true that they're looking at starting to build
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:42.940]  these three, four years from now or even less, but let's say three, four years from now,
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:44.540]  there's no way they're going to be autonomous.
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:45.540]  I mean, fully autonomous.
[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:46.540]  No, there's not.
[01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:47.540]  Yeah.
[01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:48.540]  No, from a regulatory aside.
[01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:49.540]  Yeah, they're, they're not.
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:52.220]  So whatever their reason for wanting to do it, that's not it.
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:56.820]  Like the, the, you know, what is the, the, Oh, we've got this thing that we're going
[01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:58.060]  to redefine the industry.
[01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:01.820]  It's not autonomy, not full autonomy.
[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:05.260]  It says me now, you know, but I don't think so.
[01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:07.040]  I don't think it's possible.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:10.180]  And even if it were, it wouldn't be legal.
[01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:11.780]  Right.
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:12.780]  So I don't know.
[01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:18.340]  It's a very good question and I don't quite get it, but Volkswagen, they're not afraid.
[01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:19.340]  No.
[01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:21.820]  I mean, I do agree with you though, the way that they framed it.
[01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:26.180]  Like I think that it probably would have been better to be like, we do, do the typical bullshit
[01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:27.840]  tech, uh, you know, exact thing.
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:31.140]  We welcome our competition into the new space when really you're like, Holy shit, we're
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:32.440]  watching our back.
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:33.440]  We don't welcome them.
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:34.440]  Get out of here.
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:40.700]  But I also don't feel like this is a Ed Colligan thing where, you know, he says, you know,
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:42.820]  the PC guys aren't just going to waltz in here.
[01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:47.900]  I do feel like there are a lot of things that are much more difficult about cars and a lot
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:53.500]  of things that go counter frankly to Apple's strengths, whereas the phone really spoke
[01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:57.380]  to all of their strengths even before they entered that space.
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:16:02.140]  You know, um, I would never bet against Apple to be very clear on that I would never bet
[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:03.340]  against them.
[01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:09.020]  It's just one of those things where I'm kind of like, is why, why this versus some of the
[01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:10.540]  other areas you could go into.
[01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:11.740]  That's just always my question.
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:16.020]  I guess, you know, if we're just going to spitball wildly spitball, I mean, if they
[01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:22.780]  have some kind of breakthrough that's in totally secret on batteries and electric drive, electric
[01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:23.780]  drive trains.
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:24.780]  Right.
[01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:25.780]  Like, okay.
[01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:26.780]  Okay.
[01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:27.780]  Yeah.
[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:28.780]  Yeah.
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:29.780]  I could see that.
[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:30.900]  It's something like that.
[01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:33.020]  You know, it could be something like that.
[01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:37.820]  I mean, I know right now even like Teslas are super, super heavy because the batteries
[01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:39.700]  are so big and they handle weird.
[01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:40.700]  They're very fun.
[01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:43.900]  You know, I've never driven one, but I know that they accelerate like they do that out
[01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:44.900]  of hell.
[01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:45.900]  Oh, amazingly.
[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:49.580]  And then they'd make no noise, which is, which is kind of incredible.
[01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:54.460]  Um, uh, last thing before we move on to another thing if you want to, but maybe I actually
[01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:57.500]  think that you might be right on the batteries and maybe this would be a way for there to
[01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:58.500]  test their batteries.
[01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:02.820]  Cause if they could, if they could nail battery tech in something like a car, think about
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:05.060]  how that could trickle down into all their other devices.
[01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:06.060]  Right.
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:08.380]  And if it's something that's easier to make big first.
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:09.380]  Yes, exactly.
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:11.820]  Before it gets shrunk to your pocket.
[01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:12.820]  Right.
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:13.820]  Yes.
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:16.860]  So maybe you start with that and then, you know, you kind of do, you know, like, like
[01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:17.980]  a wafer model sort of thing.
[01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:22.660]  It's like, okay, we nail this and then we can miniaturize it and put it in everything
[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:23.660]  else.
[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:24.660]  Here's the other question.
[01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:25.780]  I mean, think about this.
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:30.420]  This is a, I feel like people aren't speculating on it enough, especially now that people are
[01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:33.940]  starting to say, Hey, it's like two, three years out.
[01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:34.940]  Right.
[01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:37.100]  Is where do they sell the cars?
[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:38.100]  Right.
[01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:39.100]  Yeah.
[01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:40.100]  Yeah.
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:41.100]  That's a good point.
[01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:45.660]  I have never seen an Apple store that is ready to sell cars.
[01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:51.420]  I mean, some of the flagships, I'm trying to think I was only in the new San Francisco
[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:57.160]  flagship once the one that took over the old Levi's building.
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:00.020]  That one's pretty big, you know, fifth Avenue in New York.
[01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:01.020]  No way.
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:02.020]  Right.
[01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:03.020]  No way.
[01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:04.020]  No downstairs.
[01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:05.020]  Exactly.
[01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:06.020]  You'd have to go downstairs to show up the car.
[01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:09.540]  I mean, the thing is, is that you could do what Tesla does where, you know, you could
[01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:12.500]  have like the reservations and you could have that thing and you could have delivery.
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:13.500]  But yeah.
[01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:14.500]  Where do people go to see it?
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:17.580]  Where do people go to potentially take a test drive?
[01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:20.900]  And Tesla struggled with that, too, although they had to walk back like they originally
[01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:24.480]  were going to close a bunch of their dealerships or they don't call them dealerships because
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:29.460]  there's a legal thing around that, but their stores, but then they kept some of them open.
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:30.780]  There are a number of them.
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:34.620]  I'm not sure if they're what their state of opening is given the pandemic.
[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:40.740]  But in the Seattle area, there are like a lot of Tesla stores.
[01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:46.060]  I think Bellevue, which is a Seattle suburb, is second only to Palo Alto in terms of numbers
[01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:48.000]  of Teslas sold.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.380]  So there are a number of places where people can go get them.
[01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:56.580]  But even that, like I will say, Tesla definitely took from Apple and it's much more of an Apple
[01:18:56.580 --> 01:19:00.820]  experience where you go in and you place your order and you see a car, but it's not like
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:02.860]  you're going to drive off the lot with it.
[01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:06.060]  And it's, you know, like that's not the experience.
[01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:07.060]  Not a car dealer.
[01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:08.220]  It's not a car dealer.
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:09.220]  Right.
[01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:10.220]  Yeah.
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:13.380]  Well, I've been to a Tesla in a mall, the King of Prussia Mall here in Philadelphia
[01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:15.540]  or the Philadelphia, greater Philadelphia area.
[01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:20.460]  I think they closed the before COVID even, but they used to have a Tesla in the mall
[01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:26.020]  and you know, they had like one car in there and it was mainly a place where you could
[01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:31.660]  just go and look at one and talk to somebody and then I guess make an appointment to get
[01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:33.660]  a real, you know, test drive a real one.
[01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:36.700]  But it's very, it would be very strange for Apple.
[01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:43.500]  I mean, and on a personal level, me, John Gruber, if they come out with a car, do I
[01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.620]  get a review unit?
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:49.740]  Like a car would be a crazy thing to get a review unit for.
[01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:51.420]  No, you would get a loan.
[01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:54.000]  They would do it the same way that they do review units for other things.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.940]  They would like let you, you would sign out an agreement and you would get it for a week
[01:19:57.940 --> 01:20:00.760]  or 10 days or whatever.
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:02.340]  How would I charge it?
[01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:06.140]  Like don't you need, wouldn't you, won't you need like some kind of expensive thing in
[01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:07.140]  your garage?
[01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:09.460]  I mean, what happens if I don't have a garage?
[01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:13.060]  I happen to have a garage, but do I have room for an extra car?
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:14.680]  I'm trying to think.
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:20.860]  So because I used to work at a Gizmodo Media Group and with the Jalopnik guys who would
[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:23.900]  do a lot of car reviews and those are, you know, most of those guys live in Brooklyn
[01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:28.220]  where they don't have garages or access to any of that stuff and they would review EVs,
[01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:31.660]  although some of those people would live other places and yeah, I mean, I think that you
[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:35.420]  would find places where you could either adapt a way to charge or there would be a charging
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:38.500]  station and they might give you like a limited loan.
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:43.100]  But yeah, I mean it was, it was not uncommon where, you know, friends who live in apartments
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:48.100]  who would be, you know, test driving expensive automobiles in New York City.
[01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:49.860]  So it can be done.
[01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:55.380]  It just is obviously requires a lot more logistics than, you know, shipping somebody a phone
[01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:57.580]  or having a product briefing with a watch.
[01:20:57.580 --> 01:21:00.300]  Yeah, I don't, I don't think FedEx drops them off.
[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:01.300]  No, no.
[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:06.140]  And the thing too is that you have a much more limited number of like review devices,
[01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:07.140]  right?
[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:09.820]  Like it's not like you can give the whole press corps one, it's one of those things
[01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:14.180]  where you have like a couple or maybe like two, like one kind of for the coast where
[01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:17.700]  people are going to take turns.
[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:21.060]  So it would be a lot more limited, I assume, but yeah.
[01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:28.100]  And that even says, does Apple want the press reviews or do they want to do what they've
[01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:31.580]  been doing recently, which is do they want to see the car YouTubers?
[01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:34.020]  Like I could see them doing that, right?
[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:38.620]  Like and just bypassing the traditional automotive press altogether.
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:39.620]  I don't know.
[01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:40.620]  Right.
[01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:44.060]  And it's like, I know that there is an automotive press and I know that the automotive press
[01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:46.260]  reviews cars without buying them.
[01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:50.180]  You know, they, they get the equivalent of, you know, loaners.
[01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:54.460]  What I'm wondering is, will Apple go to the usual Apple reviewers?
[01:21:54.460 --> 01:22:01.140]  Like is it me and the Verge and Matthew Pansarino and Joanna Stern or do they go to the car
[01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:02.140]  people?
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:05.220]  Like it just seems, it seems crazy though.
[01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:08.860]  You know, and I guess, I guess it comes down to what is the thing that they think is special
[01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:09.860]  about the car.
[01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:10.860]  Yeah.
[01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:13.100]  And it probably, I mean, like they would probably go to the Verge.
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:17.420]  The Verge has a transportation editor, you know, Neelay would probably want to review
[01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:20.500]  it himself, but you know, I mean, they would probably go there.
[01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:24.740]  The Wall Street Journal would get one whether, you know, Joanna or their car reviewer be
[01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:25.740]  up to them.
[01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:31.460]  You and Pansarino, I guess it depends on if they see you as car enthusiasts and influencers
[01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:32.460]  or not.
[01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:33.460]  Right?
[01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:34.460]  Like,
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:35.700]  It's just a crazy thing for me to review.
[01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:36.700]  I agree.
[01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:37.700]  Okay.
[01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:39.220]  But like, but for instance, Marquez, Marquez Brownlee.
[01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:40.220]  Oh, definitely.
[01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:41.220]  Yeah.
[01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:42.220]  Like, like he would be number one.
[01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:45.220]  And I actually think that that would probably be, you'd see more of that type of things.
[01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:50.300]  I think that if it were me, if I were Apple and I were trying to, you know, seed review
[01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:56.020]  units for this mythical Apple car, I would be going after the big tech YouTubers who
[01:22:56.020 --> 01:23:02.380]  we all know have Teslas and get them on board, honestly.
[01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:03.380]  I don't know.
[01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:06.100]  It's just a fascinating personal aspect to it.
[01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:08.300]  And it's like, and how do I send it back?
[01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:09.300]  How do I get it?
[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:10.300]  How do you send it back?
[01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:11.300]  How do you give it back to them?
[01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:12.300]  No, totally.
[01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:13.300]  I mean, yeah.
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:14.300]  Yeah.
[01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:18.420]  I mean, and I say this as somebody who I, more than one occasion actually had, you know,
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:22.780]  companies want me to do potentially car reviews and I'm like, I don't have a license.
[01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:26.540]  I can connect with someone else, you know, like, oh, come on, but you, you can.
[01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:28.540]  I'm like, nope.
[01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:33.220]  Don't want to, even if I did, would genuinely have no interest because like you, I have,
[01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:36.820]  I live in fear of like getting in a car accident and to me, the only thing that would be more
[01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:41.260]  nightmare inducing than getting in a normal car accident would be getting in a car accident
[01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:44.500]  with a hundred thousand dollar review car for Apple.
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:48.100]  Like that would genuinely be like, that would keep me up at night, like 100%.
[01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:50.020]  Like that would be enough of a panic inducement.
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:54.200]  I wouldn't even be able to enjoy it because I'd be so freaked out about like, what happens
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:55.460]  if I wrecked this car?
[01:23:55.460 --> 01:24:00.020]  Like, yeah, I don't know.
[01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:04.540]  My guess is the way they would do it is that they would be a limited number of reviews
[01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:07.180]  just for, you know, for the obvious reason.
[01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:11.900]  And that they would deliver them, you know, like ding dong.
[01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:15.440]  They'd show up at the, you know, where, where, you know, what's your address as somebody
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:22.840]  would show up, the car is there and you know, with, with a, a colleague in another car to
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:26.860]  take the person who brought it home and then like, you know, two weeks later we're going
[01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:28.780]  to come and we'll pick it up.
[01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:29.780]  Yeah.
[01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:30.780]  Yeah.
[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:32.740]  That's I guess was what they would do.
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:33.740]  I don't know.
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:34.740]  Yeah, I think that's what they would do.
[01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:40.900]  They would probably, you know, prioritize people who either live places that have charging
[01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:47.220]  stations like in my apartment building we have a couple of EV chargers that people can
[01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:48.220]  use or whatever.
[01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:52.420]  So they would prioritize like people who either live near one that they can go to, to top
[01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:56.920]  up or have their own garage where they can retrofit, you know, have an adapter or whatever
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:02.300]  to use their, their main, you know, like power outlet to charge the, to charge the thing.
[01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:08.060]  And you know, and typically it doesn't really make a big difference that I'm in Philadelphia,
[01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:13.860]  which isn't really, you know, a hub for Apple, but I'm close to New York.
[01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:19.500]  But again, shipping anything else Apple has ever made is not that big a deal because it
[01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:21.340]  can always just come FedEx.
[01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:22.340]  Right.
[01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:25.060]  The car, like this is going to have to be on a flatbed.
[01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:28.180]  Like this is either going to have to be driven or this is going to have to be on a flatbed
[01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:29.540]  that's going to be delivered to you.
[01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:34.140]  Yeah, presumably they would have a couple sent to New York, however they send cars.
[01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:37.720]  And then I would guess somebody from New York, somebody from Apple would drive it from New
[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:40.100]  York to Philadelphia and drop it off at my house.
[01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:41.100]  But I don't know.
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:44.080]  I mean, that's what I would assume either that or they would have some sort of place
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:45.500]  where you would go to pick it up.
[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:46.500]  Right.
[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:50.260]  But like, what would they do if I lived in what's like Nebraska?
[01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:51.260]  I probably wouldn't get one.
[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:52.260]  I guess.
[01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:53.260]  You probably wouldn't get one.
[01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:56.500]  Like you would need to be somebody who'd be super high on their list for you to get one.
[01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:57.500]  Right.
[01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:01.140]  I would agree to like spend a week in California and get a hotel and, you know, drive around
[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:02.140]  the car for a week.
[01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:03.140]  There you go.
[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:04.140]  That would be it.
[01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:05.140]  Yeah.
[01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:06.140]  I mean, I'm trying to think.
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:07.940]  The car press is kind of distributed, but you do have a lot of people in Detroit.
[01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:13.540]  You do have people in New York, obviously, people in California, and they get their cars
[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:14.740]  there.
[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:18.260]  But I think for people who would be in other places who would want it, yeah, you'd need
[01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:24.820]  to either make your own arrangements or be somebody who would be deemed so important
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:30.580]  to review this that they would be willing to, you know, go through the extra stuff.
[01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:33.780]  It really just brings to mind, I mean, I've thought about this.
[01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:39.100]  It just brings to mind what a preposterous thing to own a car is.
[01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:41.940]  Like we just in America, we just have this car culture.
[01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:43.580]  I mean, this is my point.
[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:44.580]  Thank you.
[01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:48.220]  I live with someone who loves cars and I don't get it.
[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:55.120]  And so I think that this underscores my whole question, like, why are you wanting to get
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:56.540]  into this space?
[01:26:56.540 --> 01:27:02.900]  Because it is a preposterous notion that you're spending as much as you could on a house for
[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:04.540]  a depreciating asset.
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:09.380]  Well, and again, it's not like watches where you buy a $10,000 Rolex and you could sell
[01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:14.660]  it for $20,000 10 years from now, you know, as they say, it depreciates the moment you
[01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:15.660]  drive it off the lot.
[01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:18.900]  Exactly, so you drive it off the lot and it loses whatever its value is.
[01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:19.900]  And that is the other thing.
[01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:23.060]  I mean, let's go with this because I mentioned my son before.
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:28.220]  So my son's 17 years old, the driving age in Pennsylvania is 16.
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:34.780]  And when my wife and I turned 16 and we lived in the suburbs, I mean, we had already had
[01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:39.140]  our permits because you could get your permit, I don't know, it was like three months before
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:44.500]  you turn 16, you can get your driver's permit and it's like three months to the day because
[01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:47.300]  the car meant freedom when you live in the suburbs.
[01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:48.300]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:52.100]  But for your son, we talked about this last show, like he doesn't care, right?
[01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:53.100]  Right, yeah.
[01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:54.100]  So we did bring it up.
[01:27:54.100 --> 01:28:00.100]  Yeah, he's 17 and does not, the last, it's homework he doesn't want.
[01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:02.380]  What does he want to study to take a driver's test?
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:03.380]  He doesn't want to drive anywhere.
[01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:05.060]  He lives in the city.
[01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:10.140]  He walks most places he goes and once this COVID thing blows over, he'll take, go back
[01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:15.660]  to, you know, he still hasn't taken like an Uber by himself, but you know, 17, 18, he
[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:20.460]  will probably by the time the spring blows over, you know, none of his friends drive.
[01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:21.460]  They don't want to drive.
[01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:22.460]  They don't need to drive.
[01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:23.460]  And an Uber and a Lyft is better.
[01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:24.460]  You don't have to park.
[01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:27.740]  Well, you don't have to park, which parking, depending where you live, it can be extremely
[01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:28.740]  expensive.
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:33.660]  I imagine it's pricey in parts of Philadelphia and hard to find and, you know, takes time
[01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:38.980]  and if you have an expensive car, then becomes yet another like thing that you are afraid
[01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:42.100]  about because you've got your pricey car out there in the city, right?
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:47.260]  Like cars are great in the suburbs, in the cities, and I'm a city person.
[01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:50.340]  So yeah, again, like this kind of goes to my question.
[01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:55.800]  Like I think about all these things and like, I'm like, okay, this, a lot of the car companies
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:59.420]  are trying to turn themselves into tech companies, which makes sense because that's where they
[01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:01.840]  feel like they can continue to prosper and sell.
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:06.320]  But it's been a trend for the last decade that, you know, kids are getting their driver's
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:09.900]  license later and later and are, fewer people are buying cars.
[01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:12.500]  Like that's been a problem for the car industry.
[01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:17.500]  Like Ford has faced that and the other big manufacturers have too.
[01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:22.300]  And again, I would never bet against Apple because I feel like Apple is unique in that
[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:29.320]  they can enter markets that seem to not make sense and can make things work really well.
[01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:35.520]  It's just like, this just seems like, okay, but all the car companies want to be you.
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:38.900]  Why do you want to be a car company?
[01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:45.180]  And I wonder a little bit, I know lots of people at Apple live in San Francisco, literally
[01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:46.180]  in the city.
[01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:50.940]  And they take, you know, like the buses down to Cupertino and I know that's a big deal
[01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:55.880]  and that they, you know, in a way that would have made no sense 20 years ago, but it makes
[01:29:55.880 --> 01:30:00.460]  tons of sense now with ubiquitous cellular networking, you can actually, you know, start
[01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:03.380]  your workday and do be productive.
[01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:09.120]  And people go there and park and spend all day at work and then drive home if they don't,
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:12.620]  if they don't live in the city and take the bus and they live, you know, somewhere in
[01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:13.620]  between.
[01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:17.620]  But I can't help but think if there's a little bit of a bias towards car culture there because
[01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:21.220]  Silicon Valley is a place where you drive to go places.
[01:30:21.220 --> 01:30:22.220]  Yeah, you do.
[01:30:22.220 --> 01:30:23.220]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:30.340]  And if does it bias them in a way that I think in ways, lots of little ways, Apple's products
[01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:33.540]  are sort of biased towards California weather.
[01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:34.540]  Right?
[01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:35.540]  Yeah.
[01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:40.740]  Like, why doesn't the iPhone show you the temperature on the lock screen?
[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:41.740]  Right.
[01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:42.980]  Because it's 71 and sunny.
[01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:43.980]  What else?
[01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:44.980]  Right?
[01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:45.980]  Right.
[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:49.420]  Yeah, no, that's, that's a good, that's a really good point.
[01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:51.340]  Yeah, no, that makes sense.
[01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:54.860]  I mean, it does also and maybe the other thing that could influence them is that if all of
[01:30:54.860 --> 01:31:00.300]  your competitors in the area are interested in this thing, then I'm not saying that
[01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:05.140]  like you're, you have to be follow on, but it's hard to, it would be hard for that not
[01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:07.020]  to be influential in some way, right?
[01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:12.780]  Like the same way that, you know, everybody's making a microcomputer, you want to get into
[01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:17.260]  that business, everybody's making a phone, you want to get into that business, if everybody
[01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:22.180]  around you is investing in all the hiring talent is so competitive around automotive
[01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:26.780]  and about self-driving around AI and all that stuff, maybe that plays a role.
[01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:27.780]  I don't know.
[01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:28.780]  Yeah.

[01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:24.540]  You want tech support, you get a real human who knows what they're talking about and can
[01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:27.580]  help you regardless of your plan size.
[01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:33.300]  In addition to shared and dedicated compute instances, you can use your $100 in credit
[01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:39.720]  on S3-compatible object storage, their managed Kubernetes and more.
[01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:45.020]  So once again, to get started, go to linode.com slash the talk show and click on the create
[01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:47.280]  free account button to get started.
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:54.260]  My thanks to Linode for sponsoring the show and for hosting Daring Fireball.
[01:32:54.260 --> 01:32:59.580]  Let's talk about Clubhouse before we run out of time.
[01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:00.660]  What are your thoughts on Clubhouse?
[01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:09.220]  I feel like Clubhouse right now is like as we speak February 2021, it's still in private.
[01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:10.700]  I wouldn't call it beta.
[01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:12.420]  I mean, it's on the app store.
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:14.980]  It's invite only.
[01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:20.820]  But they seem to be accelerating the invitations to the point now where February 2021 sort
[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:22.940]  of is the month where Clubhouse went big.
[01:33:22.940 --> 01:33:24.740]  Yeah, I would agree with that.
[01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:26.580]  I mean, I would say maybe January.
[01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:30.580]  No, yeah, I'm trying to think when was Alon on?
[01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:32.460]  When did he do the Game Stonk thing?
[01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:35.380]  That was its Oprah joins Twitter moment.
[01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:38.380]  Yeah, 2021 to date, January to February.
[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:42.820]  And I'm sure in hindsight, there'll be even more people in March and more people in April,
[01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:44.260]  but it's getting big.
[01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:48.360]  A, can you describe what Clubhouse is?
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:50.500]  And B, tell me your thoughts about it.
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:51.500]  Okay.
[01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:56.180]  If I find something that I sent, let me find my tweet that I sent about it because Steven
[01:33:56.180 --> 01:33:59.700]  Sinofsky was annoyed with me, but I stand by it.
[01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:01.060]  Okay.
[01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:05.660]  This is what someone asked me like two weeks ago, it says, what does one do with Clubhouse?
[01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:10.140]  And then I wrote, waste time not working by listening to other people not working, talking
[01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:14.460]  about stuff they claim to be experts in, but really aren't, while hoping for celebrities
[01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:16.020]  to show up.
[01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:22.380]  Oh, that's pretty, that's pretty tart, but I don't disagree with it.
[01:34:22.380 --> 01:34:23.380]  Okay.
[01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:27.700]  And I say this as someone who I've spent a lot of time on Clubhouse, I've hosted shows
[01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:32.020]  on Clubhouse when that was still a beta feature, I think I joined in April.
[01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:34.020]  I'm not above this, like at all.
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:37.620]  I'm just saying like when I use it, it is usually because it's either the end of the
[01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:43.780]  day and there I see one of the many notifications come in that, you know, somebody you're on
[01:34:43.780 --> 01:34:48.980]  and something interesting is going on, or I'm like, you know, kind of trying to avoid
[01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:50.900]  doing actual work.
[01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:54.980]  And so I tune in in the afternoon and then listen to other people, you know, who are
[01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:56.940]  often doing the same thing.
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:01.900]  And then there is that bit of like, oh, and maybe someone famous will, you know, pop in.
[01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:02.900]  I don't know.
[01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:04.700]  I'm being totally honest.
[01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:07.500]  Like for me, that that is kind of the appeal.
[01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:10.460]  That's not to say that I don't think they're, I think that you can have some real substantive
[01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:14.940]  and interesting conversations and there are some really interesting ways it can be used
[01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:19.260]  in the way that its interest graph is both connected, but disconnected from Twitter,
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:22.900]  I think is interesting.
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:29.180]  I was in a room last week and someone's 10-year-old was briefly in the room before that was deemed,
[01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:30.740]  I guess, not okay.
[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:37.820]  And we were asking the youth some questions about their use of technology and, you know,
[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:38.820]  they kind of described it.
[01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:41.180]  Like, oh, it's discord for adults.
[01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:45.060]  And that's actually not a bad description to be totally honest.
[01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:51.300]  Like it's, you know, kind of discords audio groups, but you know, audio channels for adults.
[01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:57.540]  That's, that's not a completely terrible analogy.
[01:35:57.540 --> 01:35:59.640]  I'm trying to still wrap my head around it.
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:07.640]  I think there are, I do think they're onto something and I also think, and I haven't
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:13.140]  quite had this feeling about something since Instagram in 2010, like, so I was not on the
[01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:19.740]  Instagram beta, MGSiegler was, and he tweeted enough like pictures from it.
[01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:25.520]  I definitely kind of was like, okay, square pictures, filters.
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:31.020]  And then I was just saying on my other podcast Dithering with Ben Thompson, I think the episode
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:35.280]  that aired this morning that I remember where I was when I realized Instagram was out of
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:36.580]  beta and I could sign up.
[01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:43.420]  I was with my family down in Disney world and I was on a bus going from, I think I even
[01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:44.820]  remember which park we were going to.
[01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:51.460]  We're going from our hotel to the Disney studios park on the, the little Disney transportation
[01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:52.460]  bus.
[01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:55.020]  I was like, oh, it's out of beta, quick, get Gruber.
[01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:56.020]  Still available.
[01:36:56.020 --> 01:36:57.300]  Got it.
[01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:58.300]  Start clicking around.
[01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:02.180]  And like within five minutes, cause you know, all of a sudden we're at Disney and it's time
[01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:04.620]  to, you know, have fun and go on rides and stuff.
[01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:06.900]  I was like, oh, this is, I get this.
[01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:07.900]  This is great.
[01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:08.900]  You know?
[01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:13.800]  And now that is the original Instagram where it was just, you post pictures and you see
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:19.540]  pictures from the people you follow and you can comment on the pictures.
[01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:24.540]  And you can apply these filters that really, you know, at the time was a great feature
[01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:28.440]  because cell phone cameras were still so crappy.
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:30.820]  The filters added, it was perfect.
[01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:35.940]  In, in hipster, what was it, hipstagram or no, hipstamatic, it was, was awesome.
[01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:39.540]  So it like fit with that whole aesthetic that was happening at the time, but it made it
[01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:41.100]  easy to apply.
[01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:44.900]  Like they didn't take as long as you know, some of the other filter apps did and it,
[01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:48.440]  it really made your photos look better and added, like I remember when they added the
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:51.980]  tilt shift feature and it was amazing, right?
[01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:55.460]  The tilt shift feature was this massive deal cause I was like, oh my God, I can take Mr.
[01:37:55.460 --> 01:37:56.460]  Rogers pictures.
[01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:57.460]  Right?
[01:37:57.460 --> 01:37:58.460]  Like it's how I felt.
[01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:02.100]  At the time, the hipstamatic took so long and I still don't know.
[01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:04.020]  I've never talked to anybody who could explain it.
[01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:10.420]  I don't know if they did it on purpose to fake, but it hipstamatic took so long to apply
[01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:11.420]  filters.
[01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:13.520]  I remember talking to somebody at Apple about it and they're like, yeah, it makes no sense
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:17.600]  that even if they're using a bad algorithm, it shouldn't take that long.
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:18.780]  And it was like, yeah, it's crazy.
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:19.820]  It was frustrating.
[01:38:19.820 --> 01:38:23.000]  And Instagram let you like, oh, this filter, nope.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  This filter, nope.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.020]  And they deploy instantly and then you'd pick one that made your picture look better and
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:28.020]  then you'd post it.
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:29.020]  I was like, I got it.
[01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:31.140]  I was like, oh, this is going to be huge.
[01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:33.140]  I just, just a snap judgment.
[01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:34.440]  I feel that way.
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:39.660]  I feel that way about Clubhouse with a, just with a little less certainty because the thing
[01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:42.580]  about Instagram was I knew I wanted to use it.
[01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:45.420]  Whereas with Clubhouse, I'm like, I get this.
[01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:47.780]  I can see why people really like it.
[01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:49.380]  I don't think this is for me.
[01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:54.460]  Yeah, no, I kind of agree with you and I'm somebody who like, I go back and forth about
[01:38:54.460 --> 01:38:55.460]  my feeling.
[01:38:55.460 --> 01:39:00.700]  If I, I think that, do I think that it's, you know, current valuation is kind of insane?
[01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:01.700]  Yes.
[01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:03.940]  Do I think the concept has massive legs?
[01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:04.940]  Absolutely.
[01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:11.020]  I think the other difference is, is that Instagram came out, there were a couple of other kind
[01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:12.020]  of competitors.
[01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:16.540]  I remember there was like Pick Please, which was available on both iOS and Android that
[01:39:16.540 --> 01:39:21.320]  Dalton Caldwell, who later did app.net did and that didn't, you know, work.
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:24.700]  And there were some other kind of attempts at doing similar things.
[01:39:24.700 --> 01:39:28.260]  But Instagram was always where the momentum was.
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:31.380]  And I think it's because they had really strong product direction.
[01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:35.540]  I think that always from the beginning, the product direction and the aesthetic and the
[01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:38.240]  usability was key.
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:39.820]  It was always product first.
[01:39:39.820 --> 01:39:41.800]  It was always product first.
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:45.260]  Clubhouse is one of those things where not that I don't think, where I wonder if it's
[01:39:45.260 --> 01:39:48.620]  going to be more like an Instagram stories thing, where not Instagram stories, the Snapchat
[01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:53.580]  stories things, but you see where I'm going with this, where it's a great idea, but it
[01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:58.120]  could be potentially co-opted and done better by someone else.
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:06.220]  Like I feel like Twitter Spaces could, you know, beat it in a way that, you know, no
[01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:11.100]  one else even had a chance against Instagram, even though Instagram was iOS only until it
[01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:12.180]  was acquired by Facebook.
[01:40:12.180 --> 01:40:13.540]  Like no one else even had a chance.
[01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:19.140]  It sucked all the oxygen out of the room because it was the best.
[01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:21.860]  I feel like the concept of Clubhouse has a lot of legs.
[01:40:21.860 --> 01:40:26.180]  I just don't know if Clubhouse is going to be the thing or if it'll be whatever Mark
[01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:29.780]  Cuban things that he thinks he's doing or if it'll be Twitter Spaces.
[01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:31.420]  I don't think it'll be Facebook's thing.
[01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:35.740]  I think Facebook's thing will fall flat on its face, but I do feel like Twitter Spaces
[01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:44.980]  could potentially, you know, pull the Instagram move and make their version of stories way
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:45.980]  more successful.
[01:40:45.980 --> 01:40:51.300]  Even though it's a blatant copy, it's better, you know?
[01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:56.220]  You just echoed my thoughts exactly where I feel like either Clubhouse, Clubhouse is
[01:40:56.220 --> 01:41:04.460]  onto something, whether it is the thing and Clubhouse becomes a major titan of networking
[01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:11.700]  and owns the space or is it Snapchat stories and it just becomes a feature that everybody
[01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:18.420]  has and everybody has these audio group rooms and you can add and I don't know which way
[01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:19.420]  it's going to go.
[01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:24.940]  It's like either Clubhouse will become the thing for this in the way that Instagram became
[01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:33.380]  the thing for just sharing photos or its stories and everybody will have their own implementation
[01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:38.020]  of Clubhouse and Clubhouse is just one of them.
[01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:43.780]  On Dithering Ben and I talked about like the way that like Periscope and Meerkat were onto
[01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:51.300]  something with live streaming video from your phone, but there is no single home for live
[01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:53.420]  streaming video from your phone.
[01:41:53.420 --> 01:41:55.980]  Everybody just has live streaming on their platforms.
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:42:01.060]  You could do it on YouTube, you could do it on Facebook, you could do it on Citizen.
[01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:04.740]  It's just a feature that you add to anything that has this sort of thing.
[01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:06.700]  I don't know which way it's going to go.
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:11.660]  Here's what I see with Clubhouse and I'm not a heavy user, haven't even been there that
[01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:19.700]  long, but I see three types of rooms and tell me if you think that I'm either off or if
[01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:20.700]  I'm missing something.
[01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:23.220]  I see there's like shows.
[01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:24.920]  So like Ben Thompson was on a show.
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:30.420]  There's a show every night called, I forget what it's called now, Big Fun, Big Time, Good
[01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:36.300]  Time, Good Time last night and it's like a late night talk show, really late night for
[01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:37.300]  East Coasters.
[01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:43.800]  It's like 10 to 11 Pacific, but I was up last night and hundreds of people listen.
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:50.740]  It's a lot like a podcast except it's live and it was good and I liked listening to my
[01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:54.740]  friend Ben and the questions were good and I liked listening to it, but all I could think
[01:42:54.740 --> 01:43:02.380]  is this is just like a podcast, but with A, the frustration of you have to listen live,
[01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:08.140]  can't pause, you have to be there and tune in, which is a huge problem compared to, it's
[01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:14.060]  like going from having a TiVo to going back to not having a DVR and if you have to go
[01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:22.460]  to the bathroom or your phone rings during a show, you miss the show, which is crazy.
[01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:24.220]  Although I think that's why it works, but sorry, go on.
[01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:27.620]  Well yeah, because maybe people are willing to say different things, right?
[01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:33.320]  They're willing to be looser because they're not quite on a permanent record and I get
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:38.900]  it that that's also, it's not completely unrelated to the popularity of the Stories feature on
[01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:41.140]  all these platforms.
[01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:43.100]  B, worse audio quality.
[01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:49.740]  The audio quality is way worse than the worst podcast I've ever listened to.
[01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:51.660]  Technically, they do a great job with crosstalk.
[01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:55.140]  They really are doing some good things, but people are just talking into their phones
[01:43:55.140 --> 01:43:58.260]  and they're using phone microphones and there's a lot of compression.
[01:43:58.260 --> 01:43:59.260]  It's audio quiet.
[01:43:59.260 --> 01:44:02.280]  I had my AirPods Pro on last night and I was like, this is the worst podcast I've ever
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:03.280]  listened to.
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:08.340]  I mean, I listen to podcasts where sometimes guests call in on the phone and they patch
[01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:14.820]  them in like the old days on radio and they sound better than Clubhouse.
[01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:20.500]  So the show's thing to me is sort of like live podcasts and yeah, maybe there is a social
[01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:26.020]  psychological angle where there still is room for that because it's not a permanent record.
[01:44:26.020 --> 01:44:29.620]  Like this podcast with me and you, people will be able to listen to it in years.
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:33.180]  We don't know if they're listening to it next week or tomorrow, or if they're listening
[01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:37.220]  to it in the year 2030 and they're laughing because they're listening to it while they're
[01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:41.460]  self-driving Apple cars driving them around.
[01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:46.800]  And they're like, wow, John Gruber and Christina Warren were idiots nine years ago.
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:52.840]  And they're going to take a nap in the backseat of their Apple car.
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:54.700]  So there's shows.
[01:44:54.700 --> 01:45:00.380]  Then there's B, there's just like group chats, like seven, eight, nine people.
[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:02.860]  This is what I've done more of.
[01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:04.220]  Maybe you know them, maybe you don't.
[01:45:04.220 --> 01:45:08.860]  And there's a topic or something and there's like eight people and you have a talk and
[01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:11.420]  you're just chatting.
[01:45:11.420 --> 01:45:19.540]  I find that personally, it's like I'm on the introvert scale enough where I find it exhausting
[01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:25.700]  and in a way, but I understand that there are other personality types who crave social
[01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:30.260]  interaction and they find it energizing and they love it.
[01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:34.260]  And 2020 is a great year to launch something like that.
[01:45:34.260 --> 01:45:35.260]  100%.
[01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:42.420]  Just people who crave social interaction have no way to fulfill that.
[01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:45.320]  It's great, but that's definitely not for me.
[01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:50.100]  Do you like talking to new people when you go to a party or do you like talking to your
[01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:51.100]  friends?
[01:45:51.100 --> 01:45:55.780]  I like talking to my friends because I find it exhausting.
[01:45:55.780 --> 01:46:00.460]  That's sort of the definition of an introvert.
[01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:05.340]  But then in the middle, the ones that I find the most interesting are the ones that are
[01:46:05.340 --> 01:46:11.440]  sort of like a panel discussion at a conference.
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:19.260]  And it's different than a podcast because the audience members can participate.
[01:46:19.260 --> 01:46:20.260]  Yes.
[01:46:20.260 --> 01:46:21.260]  Right?
[01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:29.060]  So you get John Gruber and Christina Warren to talk Apple Car on Clubhouse and we could
[01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:34.680]  have a couple hundred people show up and we can pick one at a time through the app to
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:39.540]  invite people to ask us questions about what you and I think about Apple Car.
[01:46:39.540 --> 01:46:44.560]  And then for that time, it's me and you and our invited guests from the audience are now
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:46.640]  the speakers.
[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:50.980]  Everybody else is listening and they can ask us questions that maybe you and I didn't think
[01:46:50.980 --> 01:46:53.160]  about and we can answer them.
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:56.960]  And then after we talk about it, pick somebody else who has their hand up.
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:58.460]  There's like a hand raise feature.
[01:46:58.460 --> 01:47:02.340]  Now that to me is, Ooh, that's new.
[01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:03.340]  Yeah.
[01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:04.340]  No, I agree.
[01:47:04.340 --> 01:47:08.060]  I actually, I totally agree with your three categories.
[01:47:08.060 --> 01:47:12.060]  And my experience, especially early on, was mostly with that third category.
[01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:13.060]  And I agree with you.
[01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:14.060]  I think that's the power.
[01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:19.340]  Cause I think that the first two, the first one especially, I don't really see a whole
[01:47:19.340 --> 01:47:20.340]  lot there.
[01:47:20.340 --> 01:47:24.260]  I think at that point, your audio twitch, right?
[01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:26.820]  I don't know if the platform really lends itself to anything.
[01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:29.740]  I think the second one is interesting and it can be fun.
[01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:33.860]  And I'm somebody who is an extrovert and doesn't mind talking to new people, but it can still
[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:39.260]  be one of those things where, you know, it's going to be kind of dependent on what people
[01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:40.660]  you can gather together.
[01:47:40.660 --> 01:47:44.580]  And it, I don't remember party lines, but I think that that was like a thing.
[01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:47.260]  Like that was, that's kind of what that seems like, right?
[01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:51.940]  I remember they existed, but it was also, again, I don't even think I considered myself
[01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:53.100]  an introvert at the time.
[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:59.500]  I think when I was younger, I, I attributed introvert to shy and I'm not shy, obviously.
[01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:03.940]  I do a podcast, but I do find it exhausting to talk to new people.
[01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:09.340]  I just totally, whereas I think the third thing, and this is what I think is powerful
[01:48:09.340 --> 01:48:13.940]  is a, as you said, the fact that you can bring in other people, but also you add this, this
[01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:14.940]  element.
[01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:17.020]  Cause I do think the ephemerality is, is key to this.
[01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:20.380]  I think the fact that you can't listen again, you have to be tuned in live.
[01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:24.540]  You have to be participating does add something to the experience.
[01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:28.940]  And not only can you bring in listeners, but say we were talking about Apple car and like
[01:48:28.940 --> 01:48:33.020]  this would never happen, but like, let's just say, and then some listener came in and it
[01:48:33.020 --> 01:48:38.060]  turns out like it was Bob Mansfield and Bob Mansfield is a listener and now we can bring
[01:48:38.060 --> 01:48:42.140]  him in and he can talk and he can tell us all the ways that we're wrong.
[01:48:42.140 --> 01:48:47.020]  And that specific example won't happen, but there have been examples and there've been
[01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:51.380]  rooms I've been in, especially like when it was first kind of starting, um, uh, you know,
[01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:55.700]  like, like in April or so when I was, when I was on it a lot more, um, ironically, you
[01:48:55.700 --> 01:48:59.980]  know, when there were fewer people on it where you would see those sorts of situations happen
[01:48:59.980 --> 01:49:00.980]  in it.
[01:49:00.980 --> 01:49:06.660]  And I've seen that happen time and time again, where you have people who are brought in who
[01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:09.860]  might have a different perspective, or again, this is where I get into like the, the celebrity
[01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:13.200]  anger where you have somebody who like has something to add to it.
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:14.700]  That's a really interesting context.
[01:49:14.700 --> 01:49:18.820]  You might even be talking about or might even be talking around and they can share actual
[01:49:18.820 --> 01:49:25.640]  insights and give actual information in a way that you wouldn't be able to get through
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:27.100]  a show, right?
[01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:31.460]  Because that's, that's scripted and that's planned and that has like a performative and
[01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:32.940]  kind of PR field to do it.
[01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:37.140]  And that you're not going to get with just a random chat of strangers, but instead you're
[01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:43.180]  having a conversation around a certain topic with a certain set of people and you all of
[01:49:43.180 --> 01:49:46.500]  a sudden have somebody in your audience who's really interesting that you would really love
[01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:50.500]  to hear from and you can pull them up and I can't think of any other place where we
[01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:54.020]  would have that way to have kind of that, that, that two way dialogue where you could
[01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:55.020]  bring somebody in.
[01:49:55.020 --> 01:49:57.380]  And I do feel like that has a ton of potential.
[01:49:57.380 --> 01:49:58.380]  Yeah.
[01:49:58.380 --> 01:50:01.920]  And it seems like if it, like I said, like let's just say it's me and you, we're doing
[01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:09.620]  a panel discussion on apple car conjecture and people can just jump in and we see who
[01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:10.920]  has their hand up.
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:15.400]  And if you recognize, holy shit, it's Bob Mansfield or, you know, or, or, you know,
[01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:19.620]  somebody else who you just know has car experience, you know, you know, it's the, the, the CEO
[01:50:19.620 --> 01:50:25.540]  of Volkswagen, you know, well, you know, of course you're, you know, you're going to jump
[01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:30.060]  that person to the front to see, you know, what's their question and get their, their
[01:50:30.060 --> 01:50:31.400]  feedback.
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:32.400]  And yeah, that happens.
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:37.260]  And, and my thinking about this is I, and I've, you know, I've sort of gotten away from
[01:50:37.260 --> 01:50:45.220]  speaking at conferences again, COVID aside, just because I find it to be a huge time sink
[01:50:45.220 --> 01:50:49.540]  and I just have sort of reevaluated whether it's, you know, I'm not going to say I'm never
[01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:50.540]  going to do it again.
[01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:51.540]  I probably will.
[01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:55.240]  And if anything, post COVID, it's like, oh my God, let me do everything I haven't done
[01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:57.180]  in the last couple of years.
[01:50:57.180 --> 01:51:03.620]  Like but I've, you know, back when I used to go to South by Southwest, I did panel discussions
[01:51:03.620 --> 01:51:08.140]  and I always felt like it was a bit of a cheat, you know, cause it's so much like you don't
[01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:09.220]  do any preparation.
[01:51:09.220 --> 01:51:14.380]  You just, you know, pick a topic, show up, you show up and you try to entertain people.
[01:51:14.380 --> 01:51:19.540]  And hopefully I always thought I'm better at it maybe than some people because I don't
[01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:20.540]  phone it in.
[01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:25.420]  I'm every moment I've ever been on a panel in front of an audience, no matter how small,
[01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:29.260]  like maybe it was 30 people cause it was the first time I was at South by Southwest.
[01:51:29.260 --> 01:51:35.540]  But I was desperately aware, like I, you know, you've paid a lot of money to come to this
[01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:39.280]  conference and you're giving me an hour of your time and there's all these other panels
[01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:40.280]  you could have been to.
[01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:45.500]  Let me try to be as interesting and aware of your time as possible, but still it's nowhere
[01:51:45.500 --> 01:51:53.080]  near the value that I think I've delivered when I give a prepared talk that I've sweated
[01:51:53.080 --> 01:51:59.940]  over for weeks and prepare slides or, and rehearsed and you know, a talk is such an
[01:51:59.940 --> 01:52:08.620]  easier way to do, to get a speaker badge than to prepare a talk, a panel I mean, is easier
[01:52:08.620 --> 01:52:09.700]  than doing a talk.
[01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:15.420]  Just orders of, several orders of magnitude in my personal opinion.
[01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:17.560]  And it's not great.
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:23.260]  It's like the best panels you've ever heard are not that great.
[01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:30.620]  And when there is a question and answer period, it usually is awkward, often gets hijacked
[01:52:30.620 --> 01:52:37.020]  by somebody who just wants to ramble for five minutes.
[01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:42.980]  Whereas with Clubhouse, this panel idea is suited to it, right?
[01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:49.520]  Like the idea of a panel discussion is way better suited to Clubhouse than a conference
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:51.740]  because it is just audio.
[01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:53.780]  There's no reason to be in the room together.
[01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:56.340]  You know, you're not really getting that much out of it.
[01:52:56.340 --> 01:53:00.740]  And when you do do the Q and A type thing and just pull someone out of the audience,
[01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:03.000]  they become a full peer to the speaker.
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:07.220]  They're not out there in the audience on the weirdo mic that got passed around like Phil
[01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:08.220]  Donahue.
[01:53:08.220 --> 01:53:16.900]  They get put up in the top of the little window in the iPhone and now they're on stage.
[01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:19.340]  It's much more suited to it.
[01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:22.940]  It's more convenient and it's like native to the format.
[01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:26.260]  That's the thing that's most interesting to me and the thing I could see doing is some
[01:53:26.260 --> 01:53:33.060]  sort of panel type discussion thing with Daring Fireball readers and listeners of the show
[01:53:33.060 --> 01:53:34.060]  or something like that.
[01:53:34.060 --> 01:53:36.460]  I'm not saying I'm going to do it, but I could see doing it.
[01:53:36.460 --> 01:53:37.460]  No.
[01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:42.420]  I mean, that would be something I would love to participate in as a listener and potentially
[01:53:42.420 --> 01:53:46.180]  as a participant because you would have that potential option in the back of your mind.
[01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:48.900]  You're like, hey, I might even be able to have a chance to contribute.
[01:53:48.900 --> 01:53:53.660]  But even as a listener, that unexpected thing if you don't know who all is going to be there
[01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:55.180]  is really interesting.
[01:53:55.180 --> 01:53:58.700]  And you mentioned South by Southwest and it makes me think like my favorite parts of South
[01:53:58.700 --> 01:54:05.500]  by and I went for I think like 10 years in a row or something and I've been on more panels
[01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:09.360]  than I could think about and like you always try to give my own.
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:14.040]  But there was kind of a more off the cuff type of aspect of it.
[01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:16.180]  But my favorite part of South by was not the panels.
[01:54:16.180 --> 01:54:19.620]  It was the side conversations you would have at the parties or that you would have in between
[01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:22.920]  panels that you would have on the streets.
[01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:27.620]  And it would be those times when you're this is the same goes for like Macworld or something
[01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:29.340]  like that back in the day or WWDC.
[01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:34.140]  It's those hallway conversations where you have this collection of people XOXO is actually
[01:54:34.140 --> 01:54:35.140]  a perfect example.
[01:54:35.140 --> 01:54:41.260]  You have this bunch of people where you might not ever be in that same group together.
[01:54:41.260 --> 01:54:45.700]  But you you have enough common connections where it doesn't just feel like it's strangers.
[01:54:45.700 --> 01:54:49.700]  And you can have these really interesting discussions that you wouldn't expect to have
[01:54:49.700 --> 01:54:53.020]  and maybe you couldn't have naturally in any other way.
[01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:56.740]  You know, I remember I was at a conference once and I don't remember which one it was.
[01:54:56.740 --> 01:55:01.220]  And I remember that that Twitter had been hacked and like celebrities have to hack remember
[01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:04.100]  like Britney Spears's account of the hacked and something else was going on.
[01:55:04.100 --> 01:55:09.500]  And I was talking to the guy who was at the time like the head of security at Twitter.
[01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:12.820]  And he was having a real rough day and we were kind of commiserating.
[01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:18.100]  And then like somebody came up.
[01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:20.900]  I remember who it is, but I'm not going to out him because it was it was hilarious, but
[01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:21.900]  I'm not going to do that.
[01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:24.220]  And not knowing who this guy was just starts.
[01:55:24.220 --> 01:55:28.340]  Can you believe that clusterfuck with Twitter and their security and all this and that?
[01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:29.340]  And just starts going on and on.
[01:55:29.340 --> 01:55:34.060]  I was like, hey, this is this is John, you know, really runs Twitter security.
[01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:35.820]  And and, you know, guy was super embarrassed.
[01:55:35.820 --> 01:55:36.820]  It was a funny conversation.
[01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:40.660]  But it was one of those things where this news had just broken.
[01:55:40.660 --> 01:55:43.740]  And I was having this conversation and a very human conversation.
[01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:47.540]  It was, you know, good, you know, interaction with this guy who was having a pretty bad
[01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:48.540]  professional day.
[01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:52.380]  And it was not his fault, but it was, you know, stuff was was happening or whatever.
[01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:56.820]  And I'll just never forget that because it was like that's one of those happenstance
[01:55:56.820 --> 01:55:59.100]  things that's kind of a magical experience.
[01:55:59.100 --> 01:56:00.100]  Right.
[01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:05.420]  And this this feels to me like the closest thing that we could do with technology that
[01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:11.380]  can capture those sorts of, you know, situations where you could have a gathering of people
[01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:17.220]  who might not ever normally be in the same space, but could contribute something to the
[01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:22.100]  conversation or could maybe make a gaffe and not realize it, you know, amongst themselves
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:23.100]  or whatever.
[01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:27.900]  And you can get something more out of it than just blathering.
[01:56:27.900 --> 01:56:28.900]  I don't know.
[01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:31.100]  I have maybe I don't know.
[01:56:31.100 --> 01:56:32.100]  What do you think of what?
[01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:34.540]  I like the aesthetic of Clubhouse.
[01:56:34.540 --> 01:56:36.260]  I like the look of the app.
[01:56:36.260 --> 01:56:39.180]  I think they're you know, they've got like a nice little unique thing going.
[01:56:39.180 --> 01:56:42.380]  What what's the deal with the icon?
[01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:48.380]  They update it with I think it's a user, somebody from the community, every release.
[01:56:48.380 --> 01:56:49.900]  I think that's what that is.
[01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:51.220]  And do they tell you who it is?
[01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:53.820]  I mean, it's Yeah, it used to be in the release notes.
[01:56:53.820 --> 01:56:55.340]  I don't know if it still is.
[01:56:55.340 --> 01:56:56.700]  It's such a weird to me.
[01:56:56.700 --> 01:56:58.100]  It's so weird.
[01:56:58.100 --> 01:57:01.660]  But yet, I dig it because it's so distinctive, right?
[01:57:01.660 --> 01:57:04.660]  It's like when you're like flipping through apps, it's like you can't miss Clubhouse.
[01:57:04.660 --> 01:57:08.700]  It's this black and white picture of some dude with a hat.
[01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:09.700]  Yeah.
[01:57:09.700 --> 01:57:15.540]  I'm trying to think what else what do you what do you think they're going to do monetization
[01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:16.540]  wise?
[01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:17.940]  That's the interesting question.
[01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:21.980]  If anything, I mean, they might not even have to write I mean, the easiest thing to think
[01:57:21.980 --> 01:57:24.100]  about would be sponsored rooms.
[01:57:24.100 --> 01:57:25.100]  That's it.
[01:57:25.100 --> 01:57:26.100]  That's exactly.
[01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:30.140]  I was talking to one of my pal Dave Whiskas about that, I to me, that's the obvious route.
[01:57:30.140 --> 01:57:36.340]  And maybe that's because that's what that's, I built my whole career on the sponsored model.
[01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:40.100]  Which I really do see as distinct from advertising, right?
[01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:41.100]  I agree.
[01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:42.100]  I agree.
[01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:46.220]  No, because you could have a sponsored room sponsored by so and so that doesn't have to
[01:57:46.220 --> 01:57:48.100]  dictate that isn't an advertisement for that.
[01:57:48.100 --> 01:57:49.100]  No, I think sponsored rooms.
[01:57:49.100 --> 01:57:52.740]  I also feel like that could be an opportunity where if you did want to have a more formal
[01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:57.140]  panel setting or more formal conversation, and maybe if it's sponsored, like it's pinned
[01:57:57.140 --> 01:58:01.220]  to the top of the section, so it has better visibility, like, I think that's what they
[01:58:01.220 --> 01:58:02.220]  could do.
[01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:06.420]  Yeah, either sponsor a room sponsor section, have something pinned so that it's easier
[01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:09.600]  to find because the thing that they're already kind of struggling with as it gets bigger
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:11.500]  and bigger is like discovery.
[01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:13.220]  And and that's okay.
[01:58:13.220 --> 01:58:18.300]  But if to me, that would be value, if you've got all these millions of users, if your brand
[01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:21.060]  like I would think that would be what you would want to try to like get across what
[01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:26.580]  you always want and where the sponsored model works now is this the sponsored model get
[01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:32.500]  you to the valuation that they're that this as a Silicon Valley, Marc Andreessen back
[01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:34.380]  startup gets you to.
[01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:35.860]  That's the problem with that.
[01:58:35.860 --> 01:58:40.020]  That's the whole story of the last 15 years of the internet, right?
[01:58:40.020 --> 01:58:47.560]  Like the sponsored model turned Daring Fireball into a really nice business for me.
[01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:50.300]  But it is not a billion dollar business.
[01:58:50.300 --> 01:58:51.300]  No, right.
[01:58:51.300 --> 01:58:52.300]  And it never will be.
[01:58:52.300 --> 01:58:53.300]  It never will be.
[01:58:53.300 --> 01:58:54.580]  Well, it doesn't scale that way.
[01:58:54.580 --> 01:58:55.580]  Right.
[01:58:55.580 --> 01:58:56.580]  I don't know.
[01:58:56.580 --> 01:59:00.460]  I mean, you could I mean, you look at Spotify, and you look at, you know, arguably, they've
[01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:02.740]  kind of done that a little bit.
[01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:07.060]  I mean, I think you could, because I just don't think the regular advertising works.
[01:59:07.060 --> 01:59:10.740]  No, I don't see how in audio setting, I don't think there's any way that it could
[01:59:10.740 --> 01:59:11.740]  work.
[01:59:11.740 --> 01:59:12.740]  I mean, you could use subscriptions.
[01:59:12.740 --> 01:59:15.340]  But that seems weird to I don't know.
[01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:18.300]  I mean, look, I feel like the valuation is completely absurd.
[01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:22.460]  But I also feel like that the valuation is disconnected from reality.
[01:59:22.460 --> 01:59:26.300]  You know, it's its lead investors who are prominent users of the apps who, you know,
[01:59:26.300 --> 01:59:30.540]  the other VCs are fighting with, like, I kind of feel like the valuation is what the valuation
[01:59:30.540 --> 01:59:31.540]  is.
[01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:33.660]  But I don't put a total lot of stock in that if it makes any sense.
[01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:37.900]  Because to me, the bigger question, and this is also why I think that Twitter could be
[01:59:37.900 --> 01:59:43.340]  really well poised for this, is that if this is something that Twitter could do really
[01:59:43.340 --> 01:59:47.420]  well, then this is a feature of Twitter that keeps people engaged with Twitter, but doesn't
[01:59:47.420 --> 01:59:51.420]  have to be a direct moneymaker for Twitter, because they have their additional ad business
[01:59:51.420 --> 01:59:54.020]  and their additional revenue ways to make money.
[01:59:54.020 --> 01:59:55.020]  Right.
[01:59:55.020 --> 01:59:59.560]  The way my brain works is always, hey, that would be a nice, that would be a nice business.
[01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:06.240]  And it would be, you know, money for the creator and money for the company and happy users.
[02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:08.300]  And it's a virtuous circle.
[02:00:08.300 --> 02:00:09.700]  And that's the way my brain works.
[02:00:09.700 --> 02:00:15.060]  And my brain doesn't work with that's, that's a $500 billion company, right?
[02:00:15.060 --> 02:00:16.460]  I don't come up with ideas like that.
[02:00:16.460 --> 02:00:23.100]  But my thinking with the sponsorship thing is, hey, let's get a couple of nerds, and
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:29.380]  they'll talk about the new iPhone and it could be sponsored by a company that makes iPhone
[02:00:29.380 --> 02:00:30.380]  cases.
[02:00:30.380 --> 02:00:31.380]  Yep.
[02:00:31.380 --> 02:00:35.660]  And yeah, you know, it's this room is sponsored by it was like Spigen or, you know, whoever,
[02:00:35.660 --> 02:00:40.980]  you know, OtterBox or whoever, and they may sell iPhone cases, and there it is, and you
[02:00:40.980 --> 02:00:44.920]  can, you know, there'd be a thing that you could tap to learn more about their cases.
[02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:51.660]  But otherwise, and whatever they pay, you know, it could go like 80-20 or 90-10 or probably
[02:00:51.660 --> 02:01:00.540]  not 70-30, 70-30, I think we all agree is sort of, you know, 80-20 or 90-10 to the creator,
[02:01:00.540 --> 02:01:05.760]  and then there's 10 for Clubhouse and they make money and the creators make money and
[02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:13.220]  you can attract star talent to host these rooms and bring people in and that's nice.
[02:01:13.220 --> 02:01:18.140]  I do think there's probably a market to, again, is it a multi-billion dollar idea?
[02:01:18.140 --> 02:01:20.380]  I don't think so, but I think it could be profitable.
[02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:23.980]  I think pro accounts always could be profitable.
[02:01:23.980 --> 02:01:31.340]  I always think back to Flickr, where when Flickr was a big deal, people paid for Flickr
[02:01:31.340 --> 02:01:36.540]  Pro so that they could get the pro badge on their avatar because you looked a little bit
[02:01:36.540 --> 02:01:38.460]  like a simp without it.
[02:01:38.460 --> 02:01:39.460]  Totally.
[02:01:39.460 --> 02:01:45.100]  And also, you know, give you, you know, unlimited, you know, more, you know, uploads or whatever.
[02:01:45.100 --> 02:01:48.140]  And no, I mean, there were good things with that.
[02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:49.540]  Yeah, I think that sponsors could work.
[02:01:49.540 --> 02:01:51.100]  I think that paying creators could work.
[02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:54.900]  I have a feeling they would probably do the standard creator rate, which is usually like
[02:01:54.900 --> 02:01:59.180]  50-50 or something for YouTube, but who knows?
[02:01:59.180 --> 02:02:03.380]  I think the thing that they would need to be careful with on that is that if you…
[02:02:03.380 --> 02:02:07.940]  Yeah, but Substax 90-10, you know, like it's all over the place.
[02:02:07.940 --> 02:02:11.460]  I guess I'm just thinking more like YouTube terms, right?
[02:02:11.460 --> 02:02:13.180]  Like I'm thinking in those senses.
[02:02:13.180 --> 02:02:17.580]  And I think the fear with any of these things is like, you want to get your high profile
[02:02:17.580 --> 02:02:23.080]  people and you want them to do shows, but you also, those people are increasingly looking
[02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:27.900]  for like, what's the next big platform they can leverage and want to own their own brand
[02:02:27.900 --> 02:02:29.300]  and their own thing.
[02:02:29.300 --> 02:02:35.420]  So, you know, you see people like the big TikTokers all really want to be big YouTubers
[02:02:35.420 --> 02:02:37.500]  is really what it comes down to.
[02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:43.420]  So my question would be like, can… could Clubhouse make enough of a monetization play
[02:02:43.420 --> 02:02:50.940]  off of its creators, but prevent its creators from going to, you know, YouTube or Twitch
[02:02:50.940 --> 02:02:51.940]  or whatever?
[02:02:51.940 --> 02:02:52.940]  Maybe they could, right?
[02:02:52.940 --> 02:02:56.180]  Like Snapchat is paying creators now and there are some, you know, creators who are apparently
[02:02:56.180 --> 02:02:59.660]  making a lot of money and that seems to be working well for Snapchat.
[02:02:59.660 --> 02:03:06.060]  So Snapchat is, you know, a multi-billion dollar company, so… and their model has
[02:03:06.060 --> 02:03:11.020]  largely been kind of in the sponsored thing, although they have, you know, some intermittent
[02:03:11.020 --> 02:03:12.020]  ads.
[02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:16.140]  I don't, you know, know how big of a part of their revenue that is.
[02:03:16.140 --> 02:03:17.140]  I feel like they…
[02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:19.180]  I think the sponsored rooms you could probably do well.
[02:03:19.180 --> 02:03:23.900]  The only problem with that is that's obviously going to, for the biggest brands and the biggest
[02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:27.860]  rooms and the biggest things, it's going to emphasize like the most popular and the
[02:03:27.860 --> 02:03:34.940]  most populist types of conversations, which kind of, again, like, I don't know, it sort
[02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:38.780]  of shuts down some of the magic, which are some of those more serendipitous things, but
[02:03:38.780 --> 02:03:39.820]  maybe that doesn't matter.
[02:03:39.820 --> 02:03:40.820]  Maybe that's what you need.
[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:45.180]  Maybe those are your big tentpole movies that you need to pay for the rest of the slate
[02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:47.180]  and you can keep the rest of the business running.
[02:03:47.180 --> 02:03:48.780]  Is it a multi-billion dollar business?
[02:03:48.780 --> 02:03:49.780]  I don't know.
[02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:53.900]  I think it's a good idea and I think that's why we've seen everybody else wanting to
[02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:55.780]  jump on board to try to copy it.
[02:03:55.780 --> 02:03:59.860]  The last interesting thing that they do, and I wanted to get your thoughts on this, I'm
[02:03:59.860 --> 02:04:03.740]  so glad I just thought of it, I should have better notes because I almost forgot, but
[02:04:03.740 --> 02:04:09.140]  they do a thing where if you go to somebody's profile, you can see who it is who invited
[02:04:09.140 --> 02:04:12.940]  that person to Clubhouse, right?
[02:04:12.940 --> 02:04:17.660]  That's what they call it, sponsored by, you know, I guess maybe they need to change the
[02:04:17.660 --> 02:04:23.580]  language at some point, but like if I got in by being, I got invited from Dave Whiskus,
[02:04:23.580 --> 02:04:29.620]  so I think if you go to my profile, you'll see that it'll show you by Dave, yeah, which
[02:04:29.620 --> 02:04:40.860]  I've thought of about for years as a way to grow a social network and not have the problems
[02:04:40.860 --> 02:04:45.940]  that we've seen with trolls.
[02:04:45.940 --> 02:04:47.060]  They want it to be a big tent.
[02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:48.100]  They want it to be inviting.
[02:04:48.100 --> 02:04:53.060]  I think clearly they'd like to explode and become a major cultural force, but if you
[02:04:53.060 --> 02:04:59.620]  — it gives accountability — so I'm thinking they never leave the invite-only thing, I
[02:04:59.620 --> 02:05:03.700]  think that they're — that would be smart, actually — right, they stay invite-only
[02:05:03.700 --> 02:05:09.500]  forever, and they just increase the number of invitations to the existing users.
[02:05:09.500 --> 02:05:12.140]  Yeah, no, actually, I like that idea.
[02:05:12.140 --> 02:05:15.620]  And what would be interesting about that, I mean, it reminds me, so, you know, I'm an
[02:05:15.620 --> 02:05:19.980]  old and I joined Facebook when it was college-only, and it was that same thing, like you had to
[02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:25.460]  be invited by another college kid, and this was like 2005, and I don't remember, you
[02:05:25.460 --> 02:05:28.080]  know, who it was, but somebody was invited, you know, by their school, and even how it
[02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:31.580]  spread school to school, like that's how it happened.
[02:05:31.580 --> 02:05:39.920]  And there were a number of us who were non-hyperbolically sane, and I don't think we're wrong, obviously
[02:05:39.920 --> 02:05:43.780]  the business grew and got way bigger, and that changed, but Facebook fundamentally changed
[02:05:43.780 --> 02:05:49.580]  when it became available to everyone, and when you didn't have to have that gatekeeping
[02:05:49.580 --> 02:05:52.580]  thing, and it's not so much — and it got to the point, like at first it was only select
[02:05:52.580 --> 02:05:55.980]  colleges, but then it basically was anything, like as long as you had an EDU address or
[02:05:55.980 --> 02:05:59.460]  you could get someone to invite you, then you could get in, but I do wonder, like, if
[02:05:59.460 --> 02:06:03.340]  they just increase the number of invites, but you have to find somebody, like obviously
[02:06:03.340 --> 02:06:07.780]  there will be people who will be selling invites, and that's already happening, and will invite
[02:06:07.780 --> 02:06:13.400]  anybody, but the fact that you need someone's phone number beyond just their email to invite
[02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:15.420]  them is one thing.
[02:06:15.420 --> 02:06:20.220]  And the other thing, I think, yeah, showing who's invited people on the platform is one
[02:06:20.220 --> 02:06:23.860]  thing, because that's a certain way, in some respects, to hold accountability.
[02:06:23.860 --> 02:06:29.140]  If you see that a whole bunch of spam accounts or a whole bunch of agitators have joined
[02:06:29.140 --> 02:06:30.980]  by one person, you can kick that person out.
[02:06:30.980 --> 02:06:31.980]  Right.
[02:06:31.980 --> 02:06:32.980]  You could see the tree.
[02:06:32.980 --> 02:06:33.980]  You could see the tree of —
[02:06:33.980 --> 02:06:34.980]  100 percent.
[02:06:34.980 --> 02:06:35.980]  You know.
[02:06:35.980 --> 02:06:38.100]  So, maybe I shouldn't — screw it.
[02:06:38.100 --> 02:06:44.540]  So, okay, in the torrentine community, like music torrent sites, which use private torrent
[02:06:44.540 --> 02:06:48.340]  hackers, that is how it works, is that if you get an invite from someone, it will show
[02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:53.700]  who invited you, and if you then have, like, somebody who abuses the system, usually what
[02:06:53.700 --> 02:06:57.260]  happens is that the person who invited the abuser gets kicked out.
[02:06:57.260 --> 02:06:58.260]  Right.
[02:06:58.260 --> 02:07:03.020]  And that is a problem, because you want to be able to get those, you know, unreleased,
[02:07:03.020 --> 02:07:06.820]  you know, copies of whatever album you want, because —
[02:07:06.820 --> 02:07:09.020]  I don't think you're in trouble for this, Christina.
[02:07:09.020 --> 02:07:11.020]  I mean, I don't care.
[02:07:11.020 --> 02:07:13.020]  Not that you —
[02:07:13.020 --> 02:07:16.660]  Not that I would personally ever download anything illegally off the internet.
[02:07:16.660 --> 02:07:17.660]  Right.
[02:07:17.660 --> 02:07:22.540]  But, yeah, you know, but, like, I feel like there is something to be said for that model,
[02:07:22.540 --> 02:07:27.120]  and maybe it does say invite only forever, and that adds to the appeal.
[02:07:27.120 --> 02:07:31.540]  That does limit your growth, which, if you're wanting to be the next Instagram, maybe is
[02:07:31.540 --> 02:07:34.620]  a problem, but maybe that is also how you keep up the cache, because there's a certain
[02:07:34.620 --> 02:07:39.340]  thing now where everybody wants in, which does remind me of Instagram, although Instagram
[02:07:39.340 --> 02:07:42.100]  was never invite only, but it does remind me of, like, you know, those other kind of
[02:07:42.100 --> 02:07:44.580]  invite only services.
[02:07:44.580 --> 02:07:47.100]  And I think there's power to that.
[02:07:47.100 --> 02:07:48.100]  Yeah.
[02:07:48.100 --> 02:07:56.700]  By the way, about three minutes ago was the first time, I believe, in my life that I knowingly
[02:07:56.700 --> 02:08:00.220]  used the word invite as a noun.
[02:08:00.220 --> 02:08:05.380]  I've been on team invitation stubbornly for a while, but Merriam-Webster, a friend of
[02:08:05.380 --> 02:08:12.300]  mine, Paul Kapasis, pointed out on Slack this week that when I objected to invite as a noun,
[02:08:12.300 --> 02:08:15.300]  Merriam-Webster's added a note to their dictionary.
[02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:17.020]  Is invite really a noun?
[02:08:17.020 --> 02:08:18.020]  Yes.
[02:08:18.020 --> 02:08:19.020]  This is from Merriam-Webster.
[02:08:19.020 --> 02:08:22.740]  Some people feel strongly that the role of invite should be restricted to that of a verb,
[02:08:22.740 --> 02:08:26.440]  but the English language changes and grows according to its own peculiar whims and not
[02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:30.980]  those of people who write angry letters to dictionaries.
[02:08:30.980 --> 02:08:36.100]  The process whereby a word changes as part of speech is called functional shift, and
[02:08:36.100 --> 02:08:38.100]  there are tens of thousands of words which have done this.
[02:08:38.100 --> 02:08:43.900]  Some of them just bother people more than others, and invite, along with gift and friend,
[02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:50.220]  which have changed in the opposite direction, is one that attracts considerable opprobrium.
[02:08:50.220 --> 02:08:55.820]  So I have to admit, I love Merriam-Webster, probably my favorite dictionary, so I'm trying
[02:08:55.820 --> 02:08:58.420]  to buy into invite as a noun.
[02:08:58.420 --> 02:08:59.420]  Okay.
[02:08:59.420 --> 02:09:04.140]  I can be team invite for a noun as long as—and I disagree with Merriam-Webster here—irregardless,
[02:09:04.140 --> 02:09:05.140]  I don't care.
[02:09:05.140 --> 02:09:07.500]  It's not a word, and I refuse.
[02:09:07.500 --> 02:09:08.500]  I will die on that hill.
[02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:09.500]  Because it's bigger.
[02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:11.500]  That's the problem, right?
[02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:15.740]  The advantage to invite is it's shorter than an invitation.
[02:09:15.740 --> 02:09:16.740]  It is.
[02:09:16.740 --> 02:09:19.780]  And also, I do think you can make the argument it's become a noun because it is this feature.
[02:09:19.780 --> 02:09:21.460]  It is this thing, right?
[02:09:21.460 --> 02:09:25.140]  Like it has this secondary meaning, whereas irregardless is just people who are too stupid
[02:09:25.140 --> 02:09:26.140]  to say regardless.
[02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:27.140]  Yeah.
[02:09:27.140 --> 02:09:28.140]  Yeah.
[02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:36.220]  It's like where ain't is—like I'm pro-ain't because ain't has connotations.
[02:09:36.220 --> 02:09:41.100]  If it ain't broke, don't fix it works in a way that if it isn't broke, don't fix it makes
[02:09:41.100 --> 02:09:43.260]  you sound like an asshole, right?
[02:09:43.260 --> 02:09:48.860]  I mean, you're like the—that's like you're the dean at the college in the Animal House
[02:09:48.860 --> 02:09:49.860]  movie.
[02:09:49.860 --> 02:09:50.860]  Totally.
[02:09:50.860 --> 02:09:53.500]  You got to use ain't there.
[02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:54.500]  Irregardless.
[02:09:54.500 --> 02:09:55.500]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[02:09:55.500 --> 02:09:56.500]  Never.
[02:09:56.500 --> 02:09:57.500]  Never use it.
[02:09:57.500 --> 02:09:58.500]  What about the final sponsor?
[02:09:58.500 --> 02:09:59.500]  Squarespace.
[02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:01.660]  Oh, man, do you need a new website?
[02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:03.500]  Go to Squarespace.
[02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:06.460]  All in one at Squarespace.
[02:10:06.460 --> 02:10:10.720]  Everything from domain name registration to templates to pick from to components.
[02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:15.520]  You can add, take away from your site like adding a blog, adding a portfolio, adding
[02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:19.340]  a store that includes all of the e-commerce stuff.
[02:10:19.340 --> 02:10:20.800]  Everything looks professional.
[02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:23.580]  Everything works regardless of your skill level.
[02:10:23.580 --> 02:10:24.580]  Everything is intuitive.
[02:10:24.580 --> 02:10:27.260]  They have great tech support.
[02:10:27.260 --> 02:10:33.620]  Squarespace also is the place to send people to when you, the technical sort of person
[02:10:33.620 --> 02:10:37.980]  who knows how to build a website on their own, has friends who come to you for help
[02:10:37.980 --> 02:10:40.180]  and they're like, hey, I need a new website.
[02:10:40.180 --> 02:10:41.940]  Send them to Squarespace.
[02:10:41.940 --> 02:10:43.220]  Get them started on their own.
[02:10:43.220 --> 02:10:45.900]  They'll thank you because they can do it on their own.
[02:10:45.900 --> 02:10:50.300]  And you'll thank me for reminding you to send them there because then they'll be out of
[02:10:50.300 --> 02:10:51.300]  your hair.
[02:10:51.300 --> 02:10:52.500]  It is a great service.
[02:10:52.500 --> 02:10:57.140]  It is where I would send anybody and everybody who asked me for help building their own website

[02:11:19.980 --> 02:11:22.540]  What do you call the quick round?
[02:11:22.540 --> 02:11:23.540]  The bonus round?
[02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:24.540]  Yeah.
[02:11:24.540 --> 02:11:25.540]  I don't know.
[02:11:25.540 --> 02:11:26.540]  Apple TV.
[02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:27.540]  Lightning round.
[02:11:27.540 --> 02:11:28.540]  Yes.
[02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:29.540]  Lightning round.
[02:11:29.540 --> 02:11:30.540]  Apple TV.
[02:11:30.540 --> 02:11:31.540]  Yeah.
[02:11:31.540 --> 02:11:32.540]  You said Apple TV.
[02:11:32.540 --> 02:11:33.540]  Sorry, go on.
[02:11:33.540 --> 02:11:34.820]  Apple TV is where you use Siri and it works.
[02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:36.780]  I completely agree.
[02:11:36.780 --> 02:11:40.200]  I love Siri with Apple TV.
[02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:47.340]  My favorite feature on Apple TV is hold the microphone and say, what did they just say?
[02:11:47.340 --> 02:11:53.340]  And it goes back like 10 seconds, turns subtitles on, replays the 10 seconds with subtitles,
[02:11:53.340 --> 02:12:00.020]  and then just at the right moment turns the subtitles off again, which is like an order
[02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:08.660]  of magnitude less friction than manually rewinding, pulling down, manually turning the subtitles
[02:12:08.660 --> 02:12:13.820]  on, getting to the point where you read the subtitles of the thing you couldn't hear,
[02:12:13.820 --> 02:12:16.460]  and then manually turning subtitles off again.
[02:12:16.460 --> 02:12:17.460]  Yeah.
[02:12:17.460 --> 02:12:20.180]  No, I couldn't agree more.
[02:12:20.180 --> 02:12:21.180]  That is magic.
[02:12:21.180 --> 02:12:28.380]  I also think even the way that the human language search stuff does, like show me this episode
[02:12:28.380 --> 02:12:33.380]  with whatever or take me to this show, works fantastic in a way that it doesn't work well
[02:12:33.380 --> 02:12:35.020]  on any other Apple platform.
[02:12:35.020 --> 02:12:36.020]  No.
[02:12:36.020 --> 02:12:41.180]  Because I think it's the domain specificity where Siri on Apple TV knows what you're talking
[02:12:41.180 --> 02:12:42.180]  about.
[02:12:42.180 --> 02:12:47.100]  You're talking about shows and movies, and it's really good.
[02:12:47.100 --> 02:12:49.940]  But the discussion, Jason Snell wrote a piece this week.
[02:12:49.940 --> 02:12:52.660]  Why does Apple TV, the hardware box, still exist?
[02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:53.660]  Still exist.
[02:12:53.660 --> 02:12:54.820]  I think it's a great question.
[02:12:54.820 --> 02:12:57.900]  I wrote a piece about it.
[02:12:57.900 --> 02:13:02.420]  This is one of the answers people have come up with is you can talk to Siri, and it works
[02:13:02.420 --> 02:13:05.100]  great.
[02:13:05.100 --> 02:13:09.820]  But bottom line, and you say this, and I love Apple TV.
[02:13:09.820 --> 02:13:18.900]  This is where I watch most of my TV, but I protest because I care, because there has
[02:13:18.900 --> 02:13:23.140]  to be more of a reason or Apple is going to lose interest in the same way.
[02:13:23.140 --> 02:13:25.940]  Like I don't want to see Apple TV go the way airport went.
[02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:26.940]  Right.
[02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:27.940]  Right.
[02:13:27.940 --> 02:13:29.340]  No, I agree with that.
[02:13:29.340 --> 02:13:32.500]  I made a comment after Jason wrote his kind of initial thing, but before your article
[02:13:32.500 --> 02:13:36.540]  came out, and I got so much pushback from it, even though I was pretty clear where I
[02:13:36.540 --> 02:13:39.220]  was telling people, I was like, look, I love my Apple TV.
[02:13:39.220 --> 02:13:40.220]  I have two of them.
[02:13:40.220 --> 02:13:41.580]  I use it every day.
[02:13:41.580 --> 02:13:45.240]  I'm not telling people who already have an Apple TV not to use one.
[02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:51.700]  But at this state in February 17th, 2021, I cannot in good conscience recommend that
[02:13:51.700 --> 02:13:55.020]  any human being spend $180 on an Apple TV.
[02:13:55.020 --> 02:13:57.100]  I just can't.
[02:13:57.100 --> 02:14:03.020]  There's no way for me to rationally recommend a newcomer today to buy one.
[02:14:03.020 --> 02:14:04.020]  And that makes me really sad.
[02:14:04.020 --> 02:14:05.020]  But there's no way.
[02:14:05.020 --> 02:14:08.020]  I cannot come up with any argument where it is worth $180.
[02:14:08.020 --> 02:14:09.020]  It's not.
[02:14:09.020 --> 02:14:12.180]  Unless they renamed it Apple TV edition.
[02:14:12.180 --> 02:14:13.180]  Right.
[02:14:13.180 --> 02:14:14.180]  Exactly.
[02:14:14.180 --> 02:14:15.180]  That's exactly it.
[02:14:15.180 --> 02:14:16.180]  It didn't change at all.
[02:14:16.180 --> 02:14:17.180]  It didn't change.
[02:14:17.180 --> 02:14:18.180]  You don't have to go.
[02:14:18.180 --> 02:14:19.180]  It didn't change anything.
[02:14:19.180 --> 02:14:20.180]  You just call it the edition.
[02:14:20.180 --> 02:14:21.180]  And that would be it.
[02:14:21.180 --> 02:14:24.060]  Because the thing is, is that does it have a better user experience than most of the
[02:14:24.060 --> 02:14:25.060]  other boxes?
[02:14:25.060 --> 02:14:26.060]  Yes.
[02:14:26.060 --> 02:14:27.860]  Does it have the niceties like the Siri thing?
[02:14:27.860 --> 02:14:28.860]  Yes.
[02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:32.900]  Does it have arguably a better privacy thing?
[02:14:32.900 --> 02:14:33.900]  Kind of.
[02:14:33.900 --> 02:14:39.380]  The one area I'll push back is that, look, Apple might not be spying on every move you
[02:14:39.380 --> 02:14:43.940]  make, but like every single one of those apps you use is absolutely getting usage information.
[02:14:43.940 --> 02:14:48.280]  So do not be under the assumption that you are not being tracked.
[02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:50.780]  Because of course you are.
[02:14:50.780 --> 02:14:52.980]  But do those things add up?
[02:14:52.980 --> 02:14:53.980]  Because I even said this to someone.
[02:14:53.980 --> 02:14:56.020]  People are like, oh, it's so much better for this than that.
[02:14:56.020 --> 02:14:58.380]  I was like, is it $150 better?
[02:14:58.380 --> 02:15:04.260]  Because a 4K Fire TV stick, which might not have the Dolby stuff, but a lot of people's
[02:15:04.260 --> 02:15:06.140]  TVs don't have Dolby either.
[02:15:06.140 --> 02:15:07.140]  So it still does HDR.
[02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:11.980]  It just doesn't do the Dolby out-my-out-my stuff, has an Apple TV app on it so you can
[02:15:11.980 --> 02:15:17.260]  watch your purchases and you can watch the original programming, 30 bucks.
[02:15:17.260 --> 02:15:20.700]  It's got access to all the services.
[02:15:20.700 --> 02:15:25.980]  I can't come up with an argument that says this is $150 better.
[02:15:25.980 --> 02:15:26.980]  I just can't.
[02:15:26.980 --> 02:15:31.620]  Well, and the other thing too is it does seem, if it goes away, right?
[02:15:31.620 --> 02:15:36.460]  Like if Apple TV just slowly fades away and they never come out with a new version of
[02:15:36.460 --> 02:15:41.180]  the box and two years from now they just stop selling it, we'll all look back at it and
[02:15:41.180 --> 02:15:43.540]  say, yeah, I guess of course they were drifting away from it.
[02:15:43.540 --> 02:15:49.100]  That's why they added the Apple TV app to the TV sets and to all these other boxes.
[02:15:49.100 --> 02:15:50.100]  Of course.
[02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:51.100]  Yeah.
[02:15:51.100 --> 02:15:52.580]  We'll look back and say, yeah, of course that's what they were doing because that's what it
[02:15:52.580 --> 02:15:53.580]  kind of looks like.
[02:15:53.580 --> 02:16:00.520]  It kind of looks like Apple is cannibalizing their own TV box sales by saying we'll just
[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:02.140]  be a pure software service.
[02:16:02.140 --> 02:16:03.380]  We'll just be a pure software play.
[02:16:03.380 --> 02:16:04.380]  Yeah.
[02:16:04.380 --> 02:16:07.700]  At first I thought that it was just a growth play for TV+.
[02:16:07.700 --> 02:16:12.140]  I was like, okay, they know that they can't have mass adoption if this isn't on Roku,
[02:16:12.140 --> 02:16:15.460]  if it isn't on Fire TV, if it isn't on TVs.
[02:16:15.460 --> 02:16:18.340]  Because if you really want to compete with like the Disney Pluses and the Netflixes of
[02:16:18.340 --> 02:16:22.900]  the world, which they can't, but let's say that you want to compete with the Peacocks
[02:16:22.900 --> 02:16:27.300]  and HBO Maxes of the world, then you need to be on all of these devices.
[02:16:27.300 --> 02:16:30.820]  So at first that was my thought because they did a similar thing with Apple Music, right?
[02:16:30.820 --> 02:16:33.020]  Like Apple Music is available on Android.
[02:16:33.020 --> 02:16:38.500]  But when they added AirPlay to the LG TVs and when they started adding that to more
[02:16:38.500 --> 02:16:44.940]  devices, that's when you go, okay, because AirPlay had always been their specific standard.
[02:16:44.940 --> 02:16:50.480]  You have to buy an Apple product to get AirPlay and it's one of those magical things and Miracast
[02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:57.980]  and the other, you know, DLNA or MLNA, whatever things have never worked the same way.
[02:16:57.980 --> 02:17:01.860]  So when they started doing that, that was when, plus the fact that, you know, it's now
[02:17:01.860 --> 02:17:07.820]  three and a half years old hardware wise, makes me go, hmm, yeah, like what are you
[02:17:07.820 --> 02:17:09.140]  doing here?
[02:17:09.140 --> 02:17:15.460]  Because your price is completely, like it's not even in the same realm of like reality.
[02:17:15.460 --> 02:17:20.100]  Like you could cut it in half and it would still be overpriced, but you would have to
[02:17:20.100 --> 02:17:24.380]  literally like, if you lower the price to $100, it would still be more expensive than
[02:17:24.380 --> 02:17:25.380]  the competition.
[02:17:25.380 --> 02:17:30.060]  But you could maybe start to make a kind of a high end argument, but it would be hard.
[02:17:30.060 --> 02:17:32.780]  But that would be with cutting $100 off the price.
[02:17:32.780 --> 02:17:35.400]  Like it's, it's an insanely, it's insanely priced right now.
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:36.660]  And I love the Apple TV.
[02:17:36.660 --> 02:17:43.220]  I would never tell anyone to buy one right now ever because I, you know, you can get
[02:17:43.220 --> 02:17:48.360]  a TV with Apple TV built into it for not much more than an Apple TV.
[02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:54.300]  The only thing, and I, this is where I mentioned was that, you know, the only sign in the last
[02:17:54.300 --> 02:18:00.620]  year or two, or at least since their initiative to put their TV app on other companies, TVs
[02:18:00.620 --> 02:18:06.260]  and set top boxes that makes you think they have any commitment to, to their own platform
[02:18:06.260 --> 02:18:11.940]  is Apple Arcade, which is well, it, but it's a mixed bag.
[02:18:11.940 --> 02:18:18.020]  So on the one hand, every single Apple Arcade game is, it's a mandatory part of being an
[02:18:18.020 --> 02:18:21.380]  Apple Arcade game is you need to be on all of the platforms.
[02:18:21.380 --> 02:18:26.500]  You have to have an Apple TV app, which is a big commitment because there's an awful
[02:18:26.500 --> 02:18:33.140]  lot of games that the hardest platform to support is Apple TV because it's, it's a weak
[02:18:33.140 --> 02:18:34.140]  GPU.
[02:18:34.140 --> 02:18:36.220]  It pushes 4K, right?
[02:18:36.220 --> 02:18:44.720]  Like you can't, I believe, and I believe that like you, if you have like a performance sensitive
[02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:48.380]  game, you can't push 180 out of Apple.
[02:18:48.380 --> 02:18:53.700]  If you, if you're playing on an 4K, Apple 4K to a 4K TV, you need to push 4K, but you
[02:18:53.700 --> 02:18:57.560]  have to also get 30 frames per second at all times.
[02:18:57.560 --> 02:18:58.780]  And it's hard for some games.
[02:18:58.780 --> 02:18:59.780]  No, that is hard.
[02:18:59.780 --> 02:19:05.180]  I mean, look, the next gen consoles, the PS5, the Xbox Series X, they don't do that.
[02:19:05.180 --> 02:19:06.180]  Like they're optimized.
[02:19:06.180 --> 02:19:09.760]  Like they will go down to 1080p or 1440p.
[02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:14.340]  Like they don't do 4K at all times because it makes no sense to do that.
[02:19:14.340 --> 02:19:18.460]  And the games, if they're phone or iPad first, they're designed for touch.
[02:19:18.460 --> 02:19:23.180]  You're not playing with touch, you're playing with the thing and you've got the worst controller
[02:19:23.180 --> 02:19:24.180]  of all time.
[02:19:24.180 --> 02:19:25.180]  The worst.
[02:19:25.180 --> 02:19:29.400]  And again, let's just skip because we're in the bonus round, we're in the lightning round.
[02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:34.700]  Let's not even talk about the Apple TV remote as a remote for watching TV, like video.
[02:19:34.700 --> 02:19:35.700]  As a game controller.
[02:19:35.700 --> 02:19:39.040]  As a gaming controller, it is bad.
[02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:44.820]  It's like one of those jokes that the guy dies and goes to hell and the first thing
[02:19:44.820 --> 02:19:50.860]  he sees is there's just a complete replica, blade of grass, tree for tree of Augusta National
[02:19:50.860 --> 02:19:51.860]  Golf Course.
[02:19:51.860 --> 02:19:54.060]  And he says to the devil, my God, I love golf.
[02:19:54.060 --> 02:19:55.060]  This is unbelievable.
[02:19:55.060 --> 02:19:56.060]  And he says, here you go.
[02:19:56.060 --> 02:19:58.620]  And there's a brand new set of Ping golf clubs.
[02:19:58.620 --> 02:20:00.260]  And he goes, this is fantastic.
[02:20:00.260 --> 02:20:01.260]  I thought this was hell.
[02:20:01.260 --> 02:20:05.140]  And he goes, oh yeah, there's no golf balls.
[02:20:05.140 --> 02:20:07.320]  That's like the Apple TV remote.
[02:20:07.320 --> 02:20:10.160]  It is like, oh yeah, here's this thing that can play games.
[02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:14.460]  And you have Apple Arcade, so you get all the games, quote unquote, for free.
[02:20:14.460 --> 02:20:15.460]  And here's your controller.
[02:20:15.460 --> 02:20:16.700]  Here you go.
[02:20:16.700 --> 02:20:17.700]  Here's your controller.
[02:20:17.700 --> 02:20:22.340]  Here's your controller that makes using one Joy-Con on the Nintendo Switch seem like using
[02:20:22.340 --> 02:20:24.820]  one, seem like a revelation.
[02:20:24.820 --> 02:20:30.380]  It's like trying to play basketball with a wadded up newspaper is the law.
[02:20:30.380 --> 02:20:31.380]  It's very strange.
[02:20:31.380 --> 02:20:32.380]  But they do.
[02:20:32.380 --> 02:20:37.380]  They've made all of these participants in Apple Arcade make the arcade games, which
[02:20:37.380 --> 02:20:41.700]  makes me think there's maybe a commitment or I don't know.
[02:20:41.700 --> 02:20:42.700]  I'm going to be honest.
[02:20:42.700 --> 02:20:49.100]  I don't know because A, I don't know if Apple Arcade is that successful.
[02:20:49.100 --> 02:20:51.020]  I'm not working on that assumption.
[02:20:51.020 --> 02:20:54.300]  I feel like people maybe are part of it because they feel like they wouldn't be in the good
[02:20:54.300 --> 02:20:55.300]  graces of Apple.
[02:20:55.300 --> 02:21:04.180]  But I get it as part of Apple One because I pay for the $35 or whatever the most expensive
[02:21:04.180 --> 02:21:05.660]  plan is, so I get it.
[02:21:05.660 --> 02:21:09.340]  I don't use it and I play games.
[02:21:09.340 --> 02:21:10.340]  So I don't know.
[02:21:10.340 --> 02:21:16.220]  Maybe it is something there, but I wouldn't use that as a sign that shows that they're
[02:21:16.220 --> 02:21:21.700]  that deeply committed to it because this is Apple.
[02:21:21.700 --> 02:21:25.540]  I don't think they have any problem throwing their Apple TV developers under the bus and
[02:21:25.540 --> 02:21:29.940]  being like, yep, we're getting rid of this and thanks for optimizing your game to work
[02:21:29.940 --> 02:21:31.660]  with our shitty controller.
[02:21:31.660 --> 02:21:34.660]  I don't think that that would bother them at all.
[02:21:34.660 --> 02:21:37.300]  They're not good at breaking up with their products.
[02:21:37.300 --> 02:21:39.100]  They just sort of ghost them, right?
[02:21:39.100 --> 02:21:42.300]  Yeah, that's so true.
[02:21:42.300 --> 02:21:44.380]  That's sort of what they did with Airport, right?
[02:21:44.380 --> 02:21:45.500]  It's totally what they did with Airport.
[02:21:45.500 --> 02:21:48.380]  Yeah, they totally just ghosted it until one day they were like, yeah, we're not going
[02:21:48.380 --> 02:21:51.340]  to do this anymore.
[02:21:51.340 --> 02:21:57.380]  And so I feel like there's three options, either one, they're ghosting it and there's
[02:21:57.380 --> 02:22:00.900]  never going to be another Apple TV box and at some point they'll just say, oh yeah, we're
[02:22:00.900 --> 02:22:01.900]  not doing that anymore.
[02:22:01.900 --> 02:22:03.220]  Don't you have a TV that has Apple TV?
[02:22:03.220 --> 02:22:05.660]  Yeah, they'll just stop selling it like they did with the iPods.
[02:22:05.660 --> 02:22:07.420]  They'll just quietly remove it from sale.
[02:22:07.420 --> 02:22:12.940]  B, they do have some sort of plan and it has to be this year, right?
[02:22:12.940 --> 02:22:13.940]  I don't know.
[02:22:13.940 --> 02:22:18.660]  I'm not saying it's next month, but it has to be a 2021 thing because the 4K one is so
[02:22:18.660 --> 02:22:25.340]  outdated and so expensive and they come out with a new thing and it's powerful and maybe
[02:22:25.340 --> 02:22:30.180]  it has a game controller or something or some sort of story and there's something about
[02:22:30.180 --> 02:22:35.100]  it that is different than just Apple 4K with an A14 instead of an A10.
[02:22:35.100 --> 02:22:37.060]  Maybe it's $120 instead of $180.
[02:22:37.060 --> 02:22:38.060]  I don't know.
[02:22:38.060 --> 02:22:40.260]  I don't know, something.
[02:22:40.260 --> 02:22:48.300]  Or C, they come out with a new one that is just the same thing but a new chip, which
[02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:54.580]  to me is the least likely because it just makes no sense and it also is expensive.
[02:22:54.580 --> 02:22:59.620]  They just come out with another $180 box that seems exorbitantly expensive and doesn't do
[02:22:59.620 --> 02:23:05.380]  anything else and this is just it and for some reason, Apple thinks this is compelling.
[02:23:05.380 --> 02:23:07.340]  It's a very strange product.
[02:23:07.340 --> 02:23:11.660]  It is and what's frustrating to me and then we move on or lightning round is that with
[02:23:11.660 --> 02:23:14.960]  the third generation, before the fourth gen came out, they'd finally gotten that to be
[02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:21.420]  fairly inexpensive and you did have mass adoption because that was back when the Chromecast
[02:23:21.420 --> 02:23:27.700]  was pretty bad and when you didn't have the sticks and you didn't have the sub $50 very
[02:23:27.700 --> 02:23:31.820]  good, very competitive streamers and also you didn't have everything built in to every
[02:23:31.820 --> 02:23:37.520]  TV so they were doing really well with the third gen TV and then they doubled the price
[02:23:37.520 --> 02:23:44.140]  essentially when the fourth gen came out but they didn't continue to keep up and the trends
[02:23:44.140 --> 02:23:49.820]  like even if I think it's a superior experience and I do, I've used all the other ones and
[02:23:49.820 --> 02:23:53.140]  I can't like people because people ask me for advice, what thing to buy.
[02:23:53.140 --> 02:23:57.260]  I can't in good conscience tell somebody to spend $200 on an Apple TV.
[02:23:57.260 --> 02:23:59.740]  I just can't like there's no way.
[02:23:59.740 --> 02:24:01.660]  It'd be like telling somebody to buy a HomePod.
[02:24:01.660 --> 02:24:02.660]  HomePod mini, sure.
[02:24:02.660 --> 02:24:03.900]  A HomePod, hell no.
[02:24:03.900 --> 02:24:05.100]  Are you kidding me?
[02:24:05.100 --> 02:24:09.820]  Absolutely not under no circumstances but I recommend that to someone like and I feel
[02:24:09.820 --> 02:24:13.300]  like anybody who's willingly buying one needs to buy one with the understanding that you
[02:24:13.300 --> 02:24:18.500]  are overpaying by a massive margin and you are doing it for whatever reasons you have.
[02:24:18.500 --> 02:24:19.500]  Yeah.
[02:24:19.500 --> 02:24:23.540]  I guess the other thing they could do, option D would be to not change the hardware at all
[02:24:23.540 --> 02:24:25.260]  but just cut the price in half.
[02:24:25.260 --> 02:24:27.380]  If they did that, that would help them.
[02:24:27.380 --> 02:24:28.380]  Ninety-nine bucks.
[02:24:28.380 --> 02:24:31.700]  Ninety-nine bucks would make it, it still wouldn't be competitive but it would be so
[02:24:31.700 --> 02:24:32.700]  much better.
[02:24:32.700 --> 02:24:35.100]  Right but then it's within the realm of the Apple tax.
[02:24:35.100 --> 02:24:36.100]  Exactly.
[02:24:36.100 --> 02:24:37.100]  Right.
[02:24:37.100 --> 02:24:38.100]  Exactly.
[02:24:38.100 --> 02:24:40.260]  At that point, you could then go against the Roku premium or whatever which is still
[02:24:40.260 --> 02:24:43.740]  a better product spec-wise but you could make that argument.
[02:24:43.740 --> 02:24:48.660]  Right now, the thing that makes it untenable for me is similar to when the HomePod first
[02:24:48.660 --> 02:24:53.140]  came out where it's like it costs so much money compared to everything else that's out
[02:24:53.140 --> 02:24:57.140]  there that it's just, you know, what I hope they do is they do what they did with HomePod
[02:24:57.140 --> 02:24:58.140]  mini.
[02:24:58.140 --> 02:25:02.460]  I would really like to see them do a redesigned option that is more modern and that is lower
[02:25:02.460 --> 02:25:03.460]  priced.
[02:25:03.460 --> 02:25:06.100]  Maybe drop some of the features if you need to although I don't think you should because
[02:25:06.100 --> 02:25:08.100]  at this point, the chip and the tech is so old.
[02:25:08.100 --> 02:25:09.100]  Right.
[02:25:09.100 --> 02:25:17.100]  Like if it were me, you know, yeah, I would maybe require you to get a secondary controller
[02:25:17.100 --> 02:25:18.100]  to play a game.
[02:25:18.100 --> 02:25:19.100]  Right?
[02:25:19.100 --> 02:25:20.100]  Like that could be a way to make money.
[02:25:20.100 --> 02:25:21.700]  You have to buy a controller.
[02:25:21.700 --> 02:25:23.460]  The remote doesn't work as a game controller anymore.
[02:25:23.460 --> 02:25:24.460]  I don't know.
[02:25:24.460 --> 02:25:30.140]  But cut it down, make it less expensive and do what they did with HomePod mini is the
[02:25:30.140 --> 02:25:35.660]  only way I could see it being salvageable in my opinion otherwise it's just kind of
[02:25:35.660 --> 02:25:40.340]  this product they sell that is a mystery to me.
[02:25:40.340 --> 02:25:42.140]  It remains a product in our lineup.
[02:25:42.140 --> 02:25:43.140]  Yeah.
[02:25:43.140 --> 02:25:44.140]  Thank you.
[02:25:44.140 --> 02:25:45.140]  Yes.
[02:25:45.140 --> 02:25:46.140]  Yes.
[02:25:46.140 --> 02:25:47.140]  Oh my God.
[02:25:47.140 --> 02:25:48.140]  Yes.
[02:25:48.140 --> 02:25:49.140]  Exactly.
[02:25:49.140 --> 02:25:50.140]  All right.
[02:25:50.140 --> 02:25:51.140]  Lightning round over show over.
[02:25:51.140 --> 02:25:52.140]  Christina Warren, thank you for being here.
[02:25:52.140 --> 02:25:57.380]  People can follow you on Twitter, your film underscore girl, but they could just search
[02:25:57.380 --> 02:26:00.460]  for Christina Warren on Twitter.
[02:26:00.460 --> 02:26:02.380]  You want to give your your clubhouse name?
[02:26:02.380 --> 02:26:05.500]  Yeah, I'm Christina on clubhouse, I think.
[02:26:05.500 --> 02:26:06.500]  Yeah.
[02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:07.500]  You are.
[02:26:07.500 --> 02:26:08.500]  You are just Christina.
[02:26:08.500 --> 02:26:09.500]  Yes.
[02:26:09.500 --> 02:26:12.220]  This is a sign that I've been an early adopter of something if I just get my first name on
[02:26:12.220 --> 02:26:13.620]  it.
[02:26:13.620 --> 02:26:15.700]  So that's awesome.
[02:26:15.700 --> 02:26:19.500]  And I do a podcast called Rocket that I'm late for right now.
[02:26:19.500 --> 02:26:20.500]  I'm so sorry.
[02:26:20.500 --> 02:26:21.500]  You're completely fine.
[02:26:21.500 --> 02:26:23.500]  Let's tell everybody to listen.
[02:26:23.500 --> 02:26:24.820]  We'll make it even.
[02:26:24.820 --> 02:26:25.820]  Yes.
[02:26:25.820 --> 02:26:26.820]  It's a good podcast.
[02:26:26.820 --> 02:26:27.820]  It's a great podcast.
[02:26:27.820 --> 02:26:33.860]  So if you want to listen to me be slightly late for Rocket, it's relayfm.com slash
[02:26:33.860 --> 02:26:34.860]  rocket.
[02:26:34.860 --> 02:26:38.820]  And I do it Brianna Wu and Simone de Broch for it's a great time.
[02:26:38.820 --> 02:26:41.340]  And you have another podcast overtired with Brett Terpstra.
[02:26:41.340 --> 02:26:42.340]  Yes, I do.
[02:26:42.340 --> 02:26:43.340]  Thank you.
[02:26:43.340 --> 02:26:44.340]  Do overtired with Brett Terpstra.
[02:26:44.340 --> 02:26:47.960]  But Rocket's the one we really want to we really want to promote because I'm the one
[02:26:47.960 --> 02:26:48.960]  who made you late.
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:52.460]  So my thanks to my best Brianna and Simone.
[02:26:52.460 --> 02:27:08.420]  Tell them I said hi.
