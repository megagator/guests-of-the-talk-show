[00:00.000 --> 00:03.200]  What an amazing technology indoor plumbing is.
[00:03.200 --> 00:05.320]  You're a Stephen Johnson fan, right?
[00:05.320 --> 00:06.320]  Yes.
[00:06.320 --> 00:11.720]  Yeah, so you know his book Ghost Map from several years ago, like a decade ago, 2006.
[00:11.720 --> 00:15.960]  It was about the fellow who basically invented epidemiology.
[00:15.960 --> 00:16.960]  Yes.
[00:16.960 --> 00:23.640]  And, but it also has a really long discussion about how, before, I mean, there was indoor
[00:23.640 --> 00:24.640]  plumbing then.
[00:24.640 --> 00:29.240]  This is actually when we had generally had indoor plumbing in cities, how, what happened
[00:29.240 --> 00:30.240]  to all the effluvia?
[00:30.240 --> 00:31.240]  Where did it go?
[00:31.240 --> 00:32.240]  Right.
[00:32.240 --> 00:37.480]  There were all these specialized professions to deal with, like, night soil and other kinds.
[00:37.480 --> 00:42.920]  So, there were various products and various people whose professions were to handle the
[00:42.920 --> 00:44.480]  products of society.
[00:44.480 --> 00:50.240]  And it's really incredible, like, the book is great because it's about sort of how
[00:50.240 --> 00:53.840]  empirical science becomes a thing that we then start to rely on and it changes the nature
[00:53.840 --> 00:54.840]  of medicine and health.
[00:54.840 --> 00:58.520]  But it's also like, wow, there were a lot of people employed dealing with shit and
[00:58.520 --> 00:59.520]  London.
[00:59.520 --> 01:00.520]  Yeah.
[01:00.520 --> 01:01.520]  I mean, you had to.
[01:01.520 --> 01:02.520]  You had to be.
[01:02.520 --> 01:07.360]  Well, it's, if you think about it, it's not just, I first thought it often just seems
[01:07.360 --> 01:11.600]  like, wow, that would be inconvenient.
[01:11.600 --> 01:12.600]  But the volume!
[01:12.600 --> 01:13.600]  Right.
[01:13.600 --> 01:14.600]  Oh, man.
[01:14.600 --> 01:20.160]  And the smells, right, like, it's like once a year or so, I end up having to go in like
[01:20.160 --> 01:26.160]  a porta potty for some reason or another, you know, I'm at some sort of event where
[01:26.160 --> 01:27.840]  you've got to go in a porta potty.
[01:27.840 --> 01:33.320]  And porta potty technology, I think, has advanced to a significant degree where there's that
[01:33.320 --> 01:40.280]  blue stuff that's in the hole that I think does take care of an awful lot of the unpleasant
[01:40.280 --> 01:48.920]  odors of just releasing your waste into a, literally, just a big bucket.
[01:48.920 --> 01:55.960]  The whole tent cabin and camping recently and experience more sort of field the tree
[01:55.960 --> 01:56.960]  in style.
[01:56.960 --> 01:57.960]  Right.
[01:57.960 --> 01:58.960]  It's very different.
[01:58.960 --> 02:02.000]  It always occurs to me, though, that that was what going to the bathroom was like every
[02:02.000 --> 02:03.880]  single time you went to the bathroom.
[02:03.880 --> 02:04.880]  Oh, yeah.
[02:04.880 --> 02:07.760]  I try to think, like, when we think about the past, we think about inconveniences and
[02:07.760 --> 02:11.160]  we think about horses and muddy streets and all that.
[02:11.160 --> 02:14.640]  Like, were you watching Westworld just finished up?
[02:14.640 --> 02:18.640]  I have watched Westworld.
[02:18.640 --> 02:20.080]  The series is extraordinary, I think.
[02:20.080 --> 02:21.080]  The finale is great.
[02:21.080 --> 02:22.080]  I really, really liked it.
[02:22.080 --> 02:26.640]  We have an episode coming out on The Incomparable about the whole, with all full spoilers.
[02:26.640 --> 02:29.800]  But, you know, that's the vision of the West where it's really neat and clean.
[02:29.800 --> 02:33.200]  So, the people are shooting each other and there's fornication and so forth, but there
[02:33.200 --> 02:37.080]  is no horse manure on the streets of Westworld because it's cleaned up.
[02:37.080 --> 02:40.080]  And I've often thought the thing that we can't replicate when we think about the
[02:40.080 --> 02:44.440]  past is the smell and the constant mess.
[02:44.440 --> 02:50.360]  Like, everything was dirty and everything smelled until, like, 1910 or 1890 or something
[02:50.360 --> 02:51.360]  like that.
[02:51.360 --> 02:53.320]  And then it started to improve gradually.
[02:53.320 --> 02:58.520]  And then by the 1930s, cities smelled a lot less, and by the 50s, it was sort of like
[02:58.520 --> 03:00.960]  if things smelled, something was terribly, terribly wrong.
[03:00.960 --> 03:01.960]  Right.
[03:01.960 --> 03:11.160]  I've heard, maybe it was even in the Stephen Johnson book, and it makes sense, but at the
[03:11.160 --> 03:16.720]  turn of the last century, the streets of major cities like New York and Philadelphia and
[03:16.720 --> 03:22.240]  London were just curb-to-curb horse shit.
[03:22.240 --> 03:26.440]  The streets were just paved with a layer of horse shit because there was no way to keep
[03:26.440 --> 03:27.440]  up with it.
[03:27.440 --> 03:28.440]  Yeah.
[03:28.440 --> 03:29.440]  Sean, is this a metaphor for this year?
[03:29.440 --> 03:30.440]  It could be.
[03:30.440 --> 03:34.440]  I sort of feel like that's what we're등e're talking about one thing, but we need another.
[03:34.440 --> 03:40.160]  I did think that Westworld듈 thought that it was weird that they never addressed the
[03:40.160 --> 03:46.660]  sort of roughing it aspects of듈 mean, this is not a spoiler.
[03:46.660 --> 03:50.920]  The basic concept of the show is not a spoiler, that at some point in the future, there's
[03:50.920 --> 03:55.440]  like a theme park where people go, and for a lot of money, you get to pretend to live
[03:55.440 --> 03:58.760]  in the Old West for a couple of days.
[03:58.760 --> 04:03.320]  And there's action and adventure that you can take part in.
[04:03.320 --> 04:07.840]  But it's듩obody mentions that, you know, you gotta go shit in an outhouse.
[04:07.840 --> 04:10.000]  Yeah, it's pretty들t's a very들t's clean.
[04:10.000 --> 04:16.040]  I mean, there's a lot of certain bodily fluids, mostly blood, but there's no other
[04:16.040 --> 04:17.040]  kinds of bodily fluids.
[04:17.040 --> 04:22.560]  There's a sensibility thing, like, there's things you can't do and talk about, even
[04:22.560 --> 04:26.880]  on HBO, apparently, which is good, but yeah, it was supposed to be a theme park, so for
[04:26.880 --> 04:32.360]  all we know, hidden in the bushes were like, you know, little potties that broke the spirit.
[04:32.360 --> 04:37.800]  But I think, yeah, I think that's the thing that people don't get.
[04:37.800 --> 04:40.000]  People who camp know about this, of course, because they deal with it.
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.600]  You go out in the woods, you're a hunter, you like to go out and camp, and you're
[04:42.600 --> 04:45.560]  in areas that have no facilities at all, you know.
[04:45.560 --> 04:50.280]  But most of us do not have to deal with the basic human realities that people did for
[04:50.280 --> 04:53.120]  billions of years, or hundreds of millions of years, I should say.
[04:53.120 --> 04:55.760]  Pete
[04:55.760 --> 04:56.760]  Right.
[04:56.760 --> 04:57.760]  And I mean, it's getting cold in Philadelphia.
[04:57.760 --> 05:02.240]  It's very cold today, I mean, I'm not quite sure how cold, but it certainly felt
[05:02.240 --> 05:03.600]  cold when I was outside.
[05:03.600 --> 05:07.040]  And it's like, imagine, I had to go outside every time to take a leak.
[05:07.040 --> 05:13.600]  I mean, we had an inch or two of snow in Seattle, which is a snowpocalypse for us.
[05:13.600 --> 05:16.800]  So they shut down, no, I'm kidding, it mostly melted, but they start the school two hours
[05:16.800 --> 05:19.840]  late because the bus routes, we have very steep hills.
[05:19.840 --> 05:24.840]  So whenever it snows, they can't really send the buses up, they run snow routes, and
[05:24.840 --> 05:29.080]  it's sort of a safety for that rather than like, you know, the streets are impassable.
[05:29.080 --> 05:33.960]  So they don't want to have, I think bus plunge is not a headline you want to see.
[05:33.960 --> 05:34.960]  Bad.
[05:34.960 --> 05:36.480]  Jared
[05:36.480 --> 05:38.320]  Did you ever watch Deadwood?
[05:38.320 --> 05:39.320]  Pete
[05:39.320 --> 05:40.320]  I didn't.
[05:40.320 --> 05:41.320]  I heard it was fantastic.
[05:41.320 --> 05:45.240]  I think it came out when I had small children, so I never really got Oh, and you had to have
[05:45.240 --> 05:46.240]  that was on HBO, wasn't it?
[05:46.240 --> 05:47.240]  Pete
[05:47.240 --> 05:48.560]  Yeah, it was on HBO from 2004 to 2006.
[05:48.560 --> 05:49.560]  Pete
[05:49.560 --> 05:50.560]  I missed it.
[05:50.560 --> 05:53.840]  I bought HBO now I'm subscribing specifically to watch Westworld.
[05:53.840 --> 05:56.080]  So in those days, I would have had to pay the cable thing.
[05:56.080 --> 05:57.080]  Pete
[05:57.080 --> 05:58.840]  You can probably get Deadwood then, right?
[05:58.840 --> 06:02.520]  I think that the HBO has keeps most of their old shows in there.
[06:02.520 --> 06:07.080]  Yeah, it I this it's you have to know this going I thought it was a marvelous show.
[06:07.080 --> 06:08.800]  I really loved it.
[06:08.800 --> 06:15.240]  I was a big fan, it was created by a guy named David Milch, who was I guess, it was like
[06:15.240 --> 06:20.240]  before people called showrunner showrunners, but he was the guy behind NYPD blue, which
[06:20.240 --> 06:27.480]  was back in the 90s, probably the first serious TV show that I ever really fell in love with.
[06:27.480 --> 06:31.200]  And it was weird because it was a network show and I guess it was fairly cheap to produce
[06:31.200 --> 06:35.840]  and it went on forever and ever long past when it was and I kept watching because I
[06:35.840 --> 06:36.840]  liked it enough.
[06:36.840 --> 06:41.800]  But it's sort of NYPD blue sort of ended with a whisper because it just
[06:41.800 --> 06:42.800]  Pete
[06:42.800 --> 06:43.800]  Oh, yeah, that was the worst thing.
[06:43.800 --> 06:44.800]  Pete
[06:44.800 --> 06:47.200]  I mean, it was on for like 10 years or something like that.
[06:47.200 --> 06:52.440]  But but it was a great show and still had you know, there was enough good in in the
[06:52.440 --> 06:56.720]  characters to you know, make there were a couple of episodes a season that were always
[06:56.720 --> 07:02.320]  good but it was it was kind of hard and it on on was on ABC and those ABC shows had to
[07:02.320 --> 07:05.580]  do like 22 shows a year which is too much.
[07:05.580 --> 07:13.160]  Like part of the secret of the modern resonant or Renaissance in like movie quality TV shows
[07:13.160 --> 07:15.720]  is that they only do like 10 episodes at a time.
[07:15.720 --> 07:20.840]  And sometimes not even once a year might take 18 months to get the next 10 episodes out.
[07:20.840 --> 07:26.480]  There's a sort of quality instead of quantity aspect to these HBOs and Netflix
[07:26.480 --> 07:27.480]  Pete
[07:27.480 --> 07:30.360]  Season two of Westworld is coming out in 2018.
[07:30.360 --> 07:31.360]  Right.
[07:31.360 --> 07:33.920]  But although I think isn't there a little sequential thing like they sort of they played
[07:33.920 --> 07:34.920]  a little by ear.
[07:34.920 --> 07:39.240]  When they got the renewal request, but I believe Westworld has been, I think one of the most
[07:39.240 --> 07:40.240]  popular shows.
[07:40.240 --> 07:46.680]  I mean, I'm sure Games of Thrones swamps it, but they I think they are okay at HBO.
[07:46.680 --> 07:49.720]  They're very good about funding things with no strings attached, I've heard and I keep
[07:49.720 --> 07:53.420]  reading about how they're such a, they're an amazing organization by just saying they
[07:53.420 --> 07:56.920]  don't throw money at something, but they trust.
[07:56.920 --> 07:58.320]  They trust people, right?
[07:58.320 --> 08:02.740]  But they I don't think they gave them the dollars for season two are really fully committed
[08:02.740 --> 08:08.000]  until it was underway and the showrunners Nolan and Joy are saying, we need time to
[08:08.000 --> 08:09.000]  do this, right?
[08:09.000 --> 08:11.080]  They had to stop production twice to do some retooling.
[08:11.080 --> 08:15.000]  I think once was kind of tool up and the other was to sort of rejigger because they realized
[08:15.000 --> 08:19.520]  they'd gotten some mechanics wrong and they wanted to fix those, which is admirable.
[08:19.520 --> 08:21.840]  And they had the freedom to do that, which is incredible.
[08:21.840 --> 08:22.840]  And then
[08:22.840 --> 08:23.840]  Narrative mechanics.
[08:23.840 --> 08:24.840]  That's right.
[08:24.840 --> 08:25.840]  What did you mean by mechanics?
[08:25.840 --> 08:29.800]  Oh, oh, I think a world mechanics apparently they built, they built the world.
[08:29.800 --> 08:34.680]  I mean, they, it's really clear watching the whole season that they really understood
[08:34.680 --> 08:35.680]  what it was about.
[08:35.680 --> 08:40.260]  They had an arc, they had a circle, they had, there are time bombs in episode one that pay
[08:40.260 --> 08:42.540]  off in 10 and aren't referred to in the interim.
[08:42.540 --> 08:46.880]  So I trust them having watched it, but I think they had the freedom to go back and say, you
[08:46.880 --> 08:48.920]  know, we thought the world was going to work.
[08:48.920 --> 08:51.840]  I mean, this is what they said is something along the lines of we thought this is how
[08:51.840 --> 08:52.920]  the world worked.
[08:52.920 --> 08:57.960]  And then we realized that changed, but in episodes, I think it was one to three, maybe
[08:57.960 --> 09:03.160]  it was a little even more, they had elements that were now wrong inside their ecosystem.
[09:03.160 --> 09:04.720]  So they reshot and fixed them.
[09:04.720 --> 09:05.720]  So they're consistent.
[09:05.720 --> 09:10.120]  And I'm thinking how wonderful they did that, had the time to do it, that that's
[09:10.120 --> 09:11.120]  the conscientiousness they had.
[09:11.120 --> 09:12.120]  What an incredible thing.
[09:12.120 --> 09:15.880]  And I'm sure the show benefited from it, because otherwise, especially with the level
[09:15.880 --> 09:19.240]  of attention it got, can you imagine by episode five, people's like, no, well, excuse
[09:19.240 --> 09:23.320]  me, but in episode three, they bled from the left and we know that's not true in
[09:23.320 --> 09:24.320]  Westworld.
[09:24.320 --> 09:25.320]  Yeah.
[09:25.320 --> 09:32.440]  I'm actually, anyway, Wes, the thing about Deadwood, to go back one digression, was that
[09:32.440 --> 09:38.520]  Deadwood wound up getting canceled before and they didn't even have time to give it
[09:38.520 --> 09:40.640]  a proper like final episode.
[09:40.640 --> 09:42.840]  So it just sort of ends.
[09:42.840 --> 09:49.360]  So it's, I want to warn anybody before they get into it that it's a very dissatisfying
[09:49.360 --> 09:50.840]  ending.
[09:50.840 --> 09:54.560]  It's like you don't, don't go into it looking for any kind of complete loop on any
[09:54.560 --> 09:55.760]  of the characters or anything.
[09:55.760 --> 09:57.600]  You just kind of have to take it for what it is.
[09:57.600 --> 10:04.280]  But anyway, Deadwood was a Western, took place based on real people, actually, in Deadwood,
[10:04.280 --> 10:05.280]  South Dakota.
[10:05.280 --> 10:10.880]  And it was a bit, it was probably the grittiest Western I've ever seen, where there was
[10:10.880 --> 10:17.480]  some shit on the streets, you know, and they showed people urinating out in the middle
[10:17.480 --> 10:19.720]  of the street and stuff like that.
[10:19.720 --> 10:21.080]  And a Baroque swearing, I heard.
[10:21.080 --> 10:27.360]  I heard just endless, incredible, eloquent, yeah, it's the, it's probably the greatest
[10:27.360 --> 10:36.800]  Al Swearengen, he's based on a real character, a real, real person, but it was the filthiest
[10:36.800 --> 10:45.960]  mouth I've ever heard, it was poetry.
[10:45.960 --> 10:50.120]  So I guess I don't want to spoil Westwood, you can't, can't really talk details about
[10:50.120 --> 10:51.120]  it.
[10:51.120 --> 10:53.400]  But generally, I think.
[10:53.400 --> 10:56.120]  I thought it was, I really enjoyed it a lot.
[10:56.120 --> 11:00.360]  And I'm actually up to episode, there's 10 episodes in the season, I'm actually up to
[11:00.360 --> 11:02.880]  episode three, rewatching it.
[11:02.880 --> 11:03.880]  Oh, that's good.
[11:03.880 --> 11:04.880]  I haven't gone back.
[11:04.880 --> 11:08.400]  I've watched some episodes twice when they came out, and I haven't rewatched the whole
[11:08.400 --> 11:10.200]  thing.
[11:10.200 --> 11:18.400]  Kelly Guimont and Don Melton have a podcast, actually, called Hello from the Uncanny Valley,
[11:18.400 --> 11:19.800]  it's now on the Incomparable Network.
[11:19.800 --> 11:23.760]  And they've done, they did episodes, they started a little late, they did a bunch of
[11:23.760 --> 11:27.760]  episodes about the show, and now they're going to rewatch and do more episodes about it,
[11:27.760 --> 11:30.840]  because we've got a whole year to kill, so they'll be doing more, but.
[11:30.840 --> 11:36.920]  It's one of those things like the usual suspects, where when you rewatch it and you know future
[11:36.920 --> 11:42.400]  plot twists, and then you watch, and you're like, oh, they totally set that up.
[11:42.400 --> 11:46.980]  There's so many moments like that in the first few episodes that play completely differently,
[11:46.980 --> 11:52.160]  it's throwaway lines, and it's, all of a sudden, the first time watching it, you didn't even
[11:52.160 --> 11:56.140]  notice the line of dialogue, but then the second time, it gives you chills.
[11:56.140 --> 12:00.720]  It's like, whoa, that's creepy, because you know things that you didn't know them.
[12:00.720 --> 12:05.200]  It's that layering, it's like, I think you can tell when something, this is always my
[12:05.200 --> 12:08.760]  thing, I actually feel this way about software, too, is you can tell when stuff is rich and
[12:08.760 --> 12:14.940]  deep when people go back, and I mean, it works in literature, it works in filmed entertainment,
[12:14.940 --> 12:18.400]  it works in software, there's the discovery, and there's the richness.
[12:18.400 --> 12:21.920]  So you go and you look at something and you find out that what you thought was a certain
[12:21.920 --> 12:25.560]  depth is deeper and deeper, because they went, they layered, they went back around and around
[12:25.560 --> 12:29.560]  and around, and you know, you could overwork stuff, too, like a bad cook, you know, a bad
[12:29.560 --> 12:35.320]  dough when you're baking, but if it's done right, the richness kind of like comes up
[12:35.320 --> 12:38.240]  from the bottom, and the more you pay attention, the richer it becomes.
[12:38.240 --> 12:45.040]  So, do you think you would like to, like if you were in that future, would you like to go on vacation to Westworld?
[12:45.040 --> 12:48.800]  It's a great question, because right, this is the, you know, are you William, or are
[12:48.800 --> 12:53.120]  you, I don't want to give any spoilers away, are you another character in the show?
[12:53.120 --> 12:54.120]  Other than many characters?
[12:54.120 --> 12:58.420]  Like, I don't know that I would, because I think this is the, I think people have different
[12:58.420 --> 13:00.200]  amounts of dopamine in their brain, right?
[13:00.200 --> 13:04.680]  There's different ways of expressing dopamine and other chemicals that give us happiness,
[13:04.680 --> 13:10.960]  and there's people who get great joy in their life out of, like, doing ice cliff climbing,
[13:10.960 --> 13:12.680]  right, and I don't need that.
[13:12.680 --> 13:17.000]  I have this kind of natural brain chemistry I'm very fortunate to have, where I think
[13:17.000 --> 13:20.960]  I am not far off the, when I have a success in my life, or I'm doing something that I
[13:20.960 --> 13:26.000]  really enjoy doing, and I'm feeling very good about my performance doing it, I think I achieve
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.720]  maybe 90% of ice cliff climbing.
[13:28.720 --> 13:32.980]  I don't really need that extra 10%, excuse me, and some people, it's not even thrill
[13:32.980 --> 13:37.780]  seekers, it's more like a way to achieve a certain state of, like, advanced happiness
[13:37.780 --> 13:43.500]  requires doing something extreme, and I think Westworld is that, it's a great representation
[13:43.500 --> 13:47.200]  of that, because, you know, right now, that used to be something like, you know, just
[13:47.200 --> 13:51.480]  to say, it's like people go to Thailand, or they go to other places where there was a,
[13:51.480 --> 13:55.200]  you know, demimonde, or really off-the-grid kind of quality, and they can pay for anything
[13:55.200 --> 14:00.040]  they want, they can do things, they might be able to harm other people, like go do bare-knuckle
[14:00.040 --> 14:05.800]  fighting and worse. Westworld is kind of an encapsulation, it's like a cleaned up version
[14:05.800 --> 14:09.240]  of it where, you know, it's not giving you anything away to say that there are robots
[14:09.240 --> 14:14.240]  called hosts who look very, very human, they're android, they're indistinguishable, essentially,
[14:14.240 --> 14:17.080]  and you can do stuff to androids, it doesn't count, right? You're in this other place,
[14:17.080 --> 14:21.160]  it's, you know, what happens in Westworld stays in Westworld, and I don't think I have
[14:21.160 --> 14:25.200]  that desire to, I like the idea of being able to step outside myself into a different time.
[14:25.200 --> 14:30.540]  If I was going to explore, like, something like Colonial Williamsburg, that was Westworld
[14:30.540 --> 14:34.900]  quality, and I was part of the story, that sounds interesting, but I don't really have
[14:34.900 --> 14:39.780]  the desire to leap into a less controlled environment. There's actually a series of
[14:39.780 --> 14:47.320]  books called, it starts with The Many Colored Land by Mary, was it LeMay, I'm blanking on
[14:47.320 --> 14:52.000]  the name, I'll see if I can find it, but it's a future where, again, this isn't a spoiler
[14:52.000 --> 14:58.040]  because it's explained in the first few pages, the, it's a future beyond ours in which things
[14:58.040 --> 15:01.880]  are much more advanced and totally civilized, and there's a small galactic community of
[15:01.880 --> 15:07.600]  different species that interact very well, and it's very boring, and there's no risk,
[15:07.600 --> 15:11.880]  and people are deathly boring, and someone discovers a tiny portal to the past, it's
[15:11.880 --> 15:16.760]  a one-way portal, takes you six million years into the Pliocene, I think, and the idea is
[15:16.760 --> 15:20.320]  that when you walk through it, you'll never come back, there's no way to return. So a
[15:20.320 --> 15:23.320]  lot of people, they actually, governments try to repress it, then they set it up as
[15:23.320 --> 15:28.280]  kind of an exile thing, people who really want a totally uncontrolled experience, they're
[15:28.280 --> 15:31.560]  not allowed to take technology back, just their own knowledge, and they go there, and
[15:31.560 --> 15:34.880]  it's actually a really beautiful exploration of that same kind of thing, like Westworld
[15:34.880 --> 15:39.400]  is that, like, alright, I want to go someplace where the normal rules don't apply, but there
[15:39.400 --> 15:47.400]  are no consequences. Oh, Julian May, I'm sorry, is her name. Would you go to Westworld is
[15:47.400 --> 15:58.760]  my question. Do you want a Westworld experience? I, it's a very close call for me. I, no joking.
[15:58.760 --> 16:08.880]  I have no desire to have sexual intercourse with an android, no matter how realistic,
[16:08.880 --> 16:14.760]  for the same reason that, because if they're not super realistic, it's gross, and if they're
[16:14.760 --> 16:19.840]  indistinguishable from humans, it's indistinguishable from cheating on your wife. Exactly. I don't,
[16:19.840 --> 16:29.120]  you know, I, so, going back to sex with robot hookers, no, I probably, right, but they're
[16:29.120 --> 16:32.760]  very nice, though, I might chat them up at the bar, because they're very, they're all
[16:32.760 --> 16:40.320]  very good talkers, I would enjoy having a drink with Maeve, but that part, no. You know,
[16:40.320 --> 16:44.600]  here's a secret I've read by reading accounts of sex workers, sex workers say they spend
[16:44.600 --> 16:50.180]  a lot of time talking to their clients. There are some sex workers who say most of the regulars,
[16:50.180 --> 16:53.900]  they don't actually have any form of sexual contact with them. They just need somebody
[16:53.900 --> 16:57.040]  they can pay to talk to, and they don't want to go to a therapist, and they have a long-term
[16:57.040 --> 17:01.840]  relationship where that's the case. So that would be totally within the scope, I think,
[17:01.840 --> 17:05.800]  of the Westworld design. Just want to go and talk to an intelligent robot about whatever
[17:05.800 --> 17:12.340]  with no holds barred. Right. And I, would I like to go back and have, like, an adventure
[17:12.340 --> 17:18.680]  where I go out with a crew and try to catch a bandit and, you know, shoot him dead, knowing
[17:18.680 --> 17:25.680]  that, you know, if I get shot, it's more like getting hit by a paintball type thing. Maybe?
[17:25.680 --> 17:30.040]  I think when I was younger, definitely, because I used to, you know, I was never serious about
[17:30.040 --> 17:35.960]  it, but I've played paintball a couple of times and had fun doing it. I don't know that
[17:35.960 --> 17:44.920]  I, at age 43, I don't know. My time for stuff like that is maybe over. But it also seems
[17:44.920 --> 17:50.360]  like there's other people there who are just sort of exploring, right? Remember the family
[17:50.360 --> 17:57.840]  that, there was a black family with a small child who met Dolores down by the river one
[17:57.840 --> 18:03.260]  time. So it seems like there are people who go there not to, for any kind of debauchery,
[18:03.260 --> 18:08.320]  but just, you know, like a family vacation, like, let's go. Right. I do think, I think
[18:08.320 --> 18:16.020]  that it's a very thoughtful show. There were, I regretted it to some degree where I started
[18:16.020 --> 18:23.280]  reading the wrap up shows that go into detail and people taking screen captures. There was
[18:23.280 --> 18:28.480]  one point where they have these iPad-like devices, which I think were pretty well done.
[18:28.480 --> 18:35.040]  They're very thin, but not quite see-through, but they also are like tri-folds, like a tri-fold
[18:35.040 --> 18:41.880]  wallet. So they kind of fold up. They fold up to be like a, maybe like an iPhone Plus
[18:41.880 --> 18:47.760]  type thing. And then you can unfold it twice and get more of an iPad style thing. And somebody
[18:47.760 --> 18:53.320]  took a screen capture at one point of one of them that seemed to say that the show takes
[18:53.320 --> 19:00.080]  place in 21, the 21 fifties or 2015 or something. I wasn't paying attention to that. Interesting.
[19:00.080 --> 19:06.400]  Or 2050. I don't know. 2050 sounds more reasonable because, well, I don't know, maybe they don't
[19:06.400 --> 19:10.480]  know, but 2050, because you're looking at what the culture is of the employees, but
[19:10.480 --> 19:15.120]  the employees are really sequestered at the park. They seem to all live there or that's
[19:15.120 --> 19:18.400]  where they, you know, they don't seem to go anywhere else. Right. I think that, I don't
[19:18.400 --> 19:21.900]  know if the screenshot really indicates, I don't know. You know, I think they do pay
[19:21.900 --> 19:25.040]  attention to details. Who knows if that's right. But I think gut feeling-wise, that's
[19:25.040 --> 19:31.940]  when the show, it clearly isn't like super far in the future, but it's clearly significantly
[19:31.940 --> 19:37.880]  beyond where we are. Yeah. I like the computers. I like the presentation of technology in it
[19:37.880 --> 19:42.440]  and, oh, you know, the thing that I think is the best telling detail they got right
[19:42.440 --> 19:49.680]  is the way Anthony Hopkins controls Androids. Did you love that? That it's subtle. That
[19:49.680 --> 19:53.680]  he does one finger or he just says, that's enough now. And he just say it in a normal
[19:53.680 --> 19:58.900]  tone of voice. It's like a Siri thing. He doesn't have to say Android 75, halt action
[19:58.900 --> 20:02.920]  and proceed to program five B, which is what I feel like everything in the 1970s would
[20:02.920 --> 20:08.280]  have been. I saw a funny cartoon on Twitter the other day where somebody, it was just,
[20:08.280 --> 20:11.380]  somebody was talking to somebody else and they didn't like where the person was going
[20:11.380 --> 20:18.800]  and they just said analysis. Oh man. Shannon Woodward, who was one of the cast members
[20:18.800 --> 20:24.760]  of the show, I follow on Twitter and without giving any spoilers. One of the interesting
[20:24.760 --> 20:28.000]  things in the show is you get to the end of season one and you're like, whatever happened
[20:28.000 --> 20:32.620]  to like, did they really? So there's people, we don't know who has contracts for season
[20:32.620 --> 20:36.180]  two, but there are clearly things planted that make it clear. And if you go, there's
[20:36.180 --> 20:40.360]  a Westworld a site for Delos, the parent, the company that apparently owns Westworld
[20:40.360 --> 20:46.560]  and there's details being revealed. Like they must have a one year plus social media like
[20:46.560 --> 20:50.240]  marketing plan because they are already like leaking stuff and you have to go through.
[20:50.240 --> 20:55.400]  It's like a little online adventure stuff. And so Shannon Woodward posted this very funny
[20:55.400 --> 20:59.000]  thing. She plays Elsie in the shows. One of the behavioral technicians works directly
[20:59.000 --> 21:03.800]  for one of my favorite characters. Yeah, she's great. She's great. And I, you know, again,
[21:03.800 --> 21:08.020]  no spoilers. I loved her early in the season and she's also a very righteous person on
[21:08.020 --> 21:12.240]  Twitter. So great to follow because she's very active in promoting for, you know, things
[21:12.240 --> 21:16.600]  like justice and equality. But she tweeted something last night. She said, my dad, who
[21:16.600 --> 21:21.240]  was a real programmer, was excited to see how Siri had been updated. He said to Siri
[21:21.240 --> 21:28.400]  analysis, and Siri dumped out a bunch of hacks and her father, I think her father recognized
[21:28.400 --> 21:32.720]  it or what do you say? He went to Reddit. It's Unicode text. And if you look it up,
[21:32.720 --> 21:35.760]  it's a bunch of emoji that relate to the show.
[21:35.760 --> 21:36.760]  Really?
[21:36.760 --> 21:41.540]  Yeah. If you, if you said to Siri, if you say, you can ask Siri questions that are sort
[21:41.540 --> 21:45.280]  of Westworld-ish related and she will respond and say things like, that doesn't look like
[21:45.280 --> 21:50.680]  anything to me. So they updated it right away. I think. I don't know what happened earlier,
[21:50.680 --> 21:55.200]  but people weren't reporting on it. And then after the finale, Don Melton was saying probably
[21:55.200 --> 22:00.240]  a Westworld fan, you know, super fan, somewhere in the Siri team, adding more responses. But
[22:00.240 --> 22:06.400]  the hexadecimal emoji code was pretty good. I only looked up one of them.
[22:06.400 --> 22:08.440]  Who says Siri isn't getting better?
[22:08.440 --> 22:11.600]  That's great. One of them was just like a cactus. I didn't look up all of them, but
[22:11.600 --> 22:14.920]  I looked up one.
[22:14.920 --> 22:22.100]  Let me take a break and thank our first sponsor. It is our good friends at MailChimp. 12 million
[22:22.100 --> 22:26.200]  people use MailChimp to connect with their customers, market their products and grow
[22:26.200 --> 22:31.560]  their e-commerce business every day. Personalize your marketing. You can sell more stuff. When
[22:31.560 --> 22:36.960]  you connect your store to one of MailChimp's hundreds of e-commerce integrations, you can
[22:36.960 --> 22:43.760]  create targeted campaigns, automate helpful product followups and send back in stock messaging.
[22:43.760 --> 22:47.280]  They have done. This is like a huge thing. Like it's MailChimp has grown so far beyond
[22:47.280 --> 22:52.640]  just like email newsletters. The store stuff is amazing. I can't get into the details in
[22:52.640 --> 22:58.920]  the sponsor read here, but it's so much stuff. And they really hook up to a lot of the main
[22:58.920 --> 23:02.200]  e-commerce platforms that are out there. So if you do have some kind of store, what they
[23:02.200 --> 23:09.120]  can do is help you for people who opt in to like, uh, an email thing from you is based
[23:09.120 --> 23:13.000]  on what the people have bought and opted into, not like a creepy type thing, but send them
[23:13.000 --> 23:19.000]  emails that they might actually want to get with stuff they might actually want to buy.
[23:19.000 --> 23:26.200]  It is super like there's like a Renaissance in email newsletters. Um, cause I think, you
[23:26.200 --> 23:30.240]  know, back in the day people signed up for everything was going through email cause that
[23:30.240 --> 23:33.320]  was like the first way people got on the internet and then all of a sudden everybody realized
[23:33.320 --> 23:37.160]  I'm getting way too many emails for stuff that I don't want and it kind of got a bad
[23:37.160 --> 23:42.840]  rap, but then it's like water seeks its own level and I feel like there is a right amount
[23:42.840 --> 23:46.480]  and there are a lot of newsletters, a fair amount that I sign up for that I love and
[23:46.480 --> 23:51.800]  I'm happy every time I see him in my inbox. Uh, MailChimp is a way that you can create
[23:51.800 --> 23:58.440]  your own. So the store stuff, that's great if you have a store, um, all sorts of other
[23:58.440 --> 24:04.720]  great reasons that integrates with WordPress. You can integrate with Facebook, uh, Shopify.
[24:04.720 --> 24:09.660]  There's one that's integrates with the online store. Uh, all sorts of ways that you can
[24:09.660 --> 24:15.300]  hook MailChimp up to whatever platforms you're already using for whatever kind of thing that
[24:15.300 --> 24:20.400]  you want to send people to, uh, pricing. You can send 12,000 emails a month to a list of
[24:20.400 --> 24:26.620]  up to 2000 subscribers with MailChimp's forever free plan, though a few features are only
[24:26.620 --> 24:30.560]  available to paying users. So you could send an awful lot of email to a lot of people for
[24:30.560 --> 24:37.900]  free with MailChimp. Um, as a paying customer, you can send more than more than 12,000 emails
[24:37.900 --> 24:42.380]  a month. You can access additional features and you can remove MailChimp's badge from
[24:42.380 --> 24:46.640]  your campaign footers. Um, so what do you, where do you go to find out more? Just go
[24:46.640 --> 24:52.700]  to MailChimp.com no secret code, no, no slash or anything like that. Just go to MailChimp.com
[24:52.700 --> 24:58.080]  and you can get started. Great service, longtime sponsor of the show. Uh, they always sponsor
[24:58.080 --> 25:03.140]  the bar at the, uh, live talk show. So my thanks to MailChimp for once again sponsoring
[25:03.140 --> 25:04.140]  the show.
[25:04.140 --> 25:10.180]  Wow. They're, they're brave. That's very brave thing to do. Sponsoring the bar. Well, the
[25:10.180 --> 25:16.420]  first time I've often said this and I do the intro at the show, I have such very nice,
[25:16.420 --> 25:22.060]  the daring fireball audience is, is very good people. And the first time I did the live
[25:22.060 --> 25:29.700]  talk show, um, uh, when it was the second time, I guess, cause it was the first time
[25:29.700 --> 25:35.860]  at the, the, the place where we always have it now in San Francisco, um, place called
[25:35.860 --> 25:42.620]  mezzanine. Oh yeah. And we had a minimum and it seemed easily hit, uh, the first year we
[25:42.620 --> 25:46.820]  did it though, we didn't hit the minimum for the bar because people, I think, and I think
[25:46.820 --> 25:52.060]  what happened was that I'd said that it's an open bar and, and, and it's, you know,
[25:52.060 --> 25:56.380]  free, but I didn't emphasize enough that seriously drink as much as you want. Like go have a
[25:56.380 --> 26:02.220]  second or a third. I think that people were like, well, I'll have one, but I don't want
[26:02.220 --> 26:06.380]  to, I don't want to stick Gruber with a big tab, but it was, we actually didn't reach
[26:06.380 --> 26:11.100]  the minimum. So ever since I always tell that story to the audience, you know, like seriously
[26:11.100 --> 26:14.860]  drink, you know, we've, we've never had problems hitting the minimum. That's, that's pretty,
[26:14.860 --> 26:18.740]  that's adorable. That is a very lovely audience when you have to encourage them to spend,
[26:18.740 --> 26:24.620]  to, you know, to use the money that sponsors and they have different, um, tiers of booze.
[26:24.620 --> 26:30.900]  Like you could just do beer, beer and wine. You can, you know, um, you know, you could,
[26:30.900 --> 26:34.900]  but I get the top shelf booze, you know, like the name brand, you know, vodka and stuff
[26:34.900 --> 26:40.020]  like that. Like instead of, you know, uncle Joe's, you know, uncle Joe's Russian specials,
[26:40.020 --> 26:44.240]  you know, uh, I gotta say, you know, whatever you want, if it's back there, it's supposed
[26:44.240 --> 26:49.460]  to be there. Have as much of it as you want. And, and male chimp will just pick it up.
[26:49.460 --> 26:58.700]  It's very easy for me to be generous to the fires. Bathtub gin money will buy. Well, it's
[26:58.700 --> 27:03.260]  funny though. It's gotten the other way around now. Like there's, it's like, I think when
[27:03.260 --> 27:09.720]  we were kids, like, like if the gin was made locally, it's like, watch out, you know, better
[27:09.720 --> 27:14.260]  schedule a trip to the eye doctor because you might go blind. Whereas now there are
[27:14.260 --> 27:19.100]  so many craft distilleries. Uh, I can't even tell you, I was just looking the other day,
[27:19.100 --> 27:22.640]  there's a section in the liquor store here where it's like made in Pennsylvania and there's
[27:22.640 --> 27:28.580]  so many, so many, uh, gins being made in Pennsylvania now and they all have like these amazingly
[27:28.580 --> 27:33.820]  exquisite, uh, designed labels. You know, they all look excellent. It's not, you know,
[27:33.820 --> 27:38.040]  like the local stuff is expensive now. It's not, it's not, oh man, I had a friend who
[27:38.040 --> 27:42.840]  wanted to start years ago, like I think it was almost 20 years ago, he wanted to start
[27:42.840 --> 27:47.840]  a local craft distillery as a distill pub. No such thing existed in Washington state.
[27:47.840 --> 27:52.240]  He'd been a brewer, had run, you know, brew pubs and worked in breweries, had, you know,
[27:52.240 --> 27:55.860]  done the craft thing. He was totally capable of it and the state didn't know how to license
[27:55.860 --> 28:00.700]  it. But he was trying to buy this bar in the Georgetown area in Seattle, which is this
[28:00.700 --> 28:06.680]  little weird spot that bars operated during prohibition. There was this very weird exception
[28:06.680 --> 28:11.520]  or exclusion or scam or something. So it was like the longest operating bar in North, continuously
[28:11.520 --> 28:17.020]  operating bar in North America. He was almost, he was going to try to buy it with investors
[28:17.020 --> 28:20.680]  to turn it into the state's first distill pub and one of the first ones in the country,
[28:20.680 --> 28:24.240]  I think maybe at the time, and they couldn't pull it off cause no one knew how to license
[28:24.240 --> 28:27.360]  it. But now it's like, I don't know if you have, no, there are distill pubs. I've seen
[28:27.360 --> 28:30.760]  places, I don't know what they, they call it, sorry, distill pub is not the right word,
[28:30.760 --> 28:31.760]  but
[28:31.760 --> 28:37.280]  that's the Unix command, distill pub. But yeah, but any places that are doing like certain
[28:37.280 --> 28:41.880]  kinds of liquor on site, which is, which is, I think that's really cool. It's like, you
[28:41.880 --> 28:45.600]  know, this is, we're trying, we sort of, Westworld is indicative of this, right? There are things
[28:45.600 --> 28:51.160]  about the 19th century that we idealize and we'd like the neat, clean, cool component
[28:51.160 --> 28:54.120]  of it because it seems more real to us.
[28:54.120 --> 28:59.740]  Yeah. It's just another one of those little things though that makes me feel like I was
[28:59.740 --> 29:06.480]  born at the right time. I don't know. Maybe that's, it's, maybe it's my personality where
[29:06.480 --> 29:11.160]  if, whenever I had been born, whether it was the future or further in the past, I, it just,
[29:11.160 --> 29:15.080]  I would have, I have the personality type or I would think I was born at the right time,
[29:15.080 --> 29:19.700]  but just little things like the fact that I was around as a kid when computers were
[29:19.700 --> 29:24.680]  super simple and you could totally understand the entirety of how the computer worked as
[29:24.680 --> 29:30.680]  like a 12 year old. I love that. Like there's a part of me that is a little jealous that
[29:30.680 --> 29:35.600]  like my son is, you know, growing up in a world where, you know, at the age of 12, he's
[29:35.600 --> 29:40.600]  got a Mac book pro. I mean, it would have been very impressive to 12 year old John Gruber,
[29:40.600 --> 29:44.800]  but I feel like it was right for me that it was, you know, that I was clacking away on
[29:44.800 --> 29:47.400]  an Apple two E at school, you know?
[29:47.400 --> 29:51.560]  Yeah. My 12 year old is like programming and JavaScript and other stuff. And I'm like,
[29:51.560 --> 29:57.800]  you know, at 12, I was like soldering RS-232C ports on my, you know, 8K computer. So I feel
[29:57.800 --> 30:01.080]  bad. I mean, I'll open up a computer to change something out and the kids freak out slightly.
[30:01.080 --> 30:05.120]  Like, can you really do that? And not like it's illegal. But the more like, like, won't
[30:05.120 --> 30:10.380]  that break it? I'm like, no, no, you can actually fix things. It's sort of a sad.
[30:10.380 --> 30:16.120]  In terms of consumable beverages, I like to drink coffee, but I like really, really, really
[30:16.120 --> 30:21.460]  good coffee. And a generation ago, there was no such thing. I mean, I realized there were
[30:21.460 --> 30:28.200]  some people who kept the art of it alive, but as a mass market product, you know, like
[30:28.200 --> 30:32.480]  people went into the supermarket and bought a can of Maxwell.
[30:32.480 --> 30:36.920]  I think this is the best time in history to be alive for coffee because for most of coffee's
[30:36.920 --> 30:42.240]  history, it was not made well, except in limited places. If you could get the beans and it's
[30:42.240 --> 30:45.240]  all there, like you had to be in right, just the right spot at the right time.
[30:45.240 --> 30:50.080]  But when we were kids, the coffee that our parents drank wasn't even made out of Arabica
[30:50.080 --> 30:55.000]  beans. It was made out of, it wasn't even really coffee. It was made out of some other
[30:55.000 --> 30:57.240]  like weird cheap beans.
[30:57.240 --> 31:00.960]  Were they chicory based or is that something else?
[31:00.960 --> 31:04.160]  There's some difference. I could ask Marco, I'm sure he could.
[31:04.160 --> 31:08.520]  I thought they melted brown crayons in water.
[31:08.520 --> 31:14.240]  The basic story is that good coffee from Arabica beans needs a certain kind of climate and
[31:14.240 --> 31:18.440]  a certain type of atmosphere. And that's why it tends to grow at the top of mountains
[31:18.440 --> 31:24.820]  and certain regions of the world where the temperature is right. It's very particular
[31:24.820 --> 31:28.280]  about where it will grow well. And then there's another type of coffee bean that'll grow
[31:28.280 --> 31:37.120]  anywhere. And that's like what the coffee of like the late 20th, post-World War II 20th
[31:37.120 --> 31:41.920]  century America was made out of because it was super cheap.
[31:41.920 --> 31:47.040]  The coffee cycle is so funny too. Our mutual friend Tonks, this Tony connects me, I met
[31:47.040 --> 31:52.380]  him first, I think we talked about this in some episode before, but in 2004 I met him
[31:52.380 --> 31:57.240]  when he was the head broaster at a local coffee shop that started up that was trying to be
[31:57.240 --> 32:01.020]  more of a community coffee shop again. They were trying to reclaim from Wi-Fi already.
[32:01.020 --> 32:04.980]  And I went to my first cupping in the back of that store when I was reporting the story.
[32:04.980 --> 32:08.280]  And then Tony left and, you know, kind of traveled a bunch and he started his own brand
[32:08.280 --> 32:14.160]  that got sold to Blue Bottle. And then, you know, and he's, he's, he's, you know, he's
[32:14.160 --> 32:18.840]  kicking around doing stuff, but I'm like now cupping is like such a standard thing. Like
[32:18.840 --> 32:25.400]  it's a thing people expect, like the sophistication even of 2004 now seems almost quaint.
[32:25.400 --> 32:29.000]  And when Howard Schultz just announced that he was stepping down to see you at Starbucks,
[32:29.000 --> 32:33.560]  he did it at the 15th Avenue, I think it was the 15th Avenue, roasting place, which is
[32:33.560 --> 32:38.640]  Starbucks' new model for a place that is like a roasting center with cuppings and high end
[32:38.640 --> 32:42.520]  coffees and the whole bit. Like it's now a thing they are commercializing and pushing
[32:42.520 --> 32:48.000]  out as a, you know, high end experience as a, you know, repeatable deal. And that's,
[32:48.000 --> 32:50.360]  you know, that's already where we're at. So what's the next refinement? Like there's
[32:50.360 --> 32:54.160]  got to be like 10 years from now, we're going to be looking at that as, as, as coarse and
[32:54.160 --> 32:55.160]  quaint, I'm sure.
[32:55.160 --> 33:01.000]  And, you know, in the evening hours, I, I enjoy the occasional adult beverage and it's,
[33:01.000 --> 33:06.080]  there's never been a better time. I mean, it's, if you like beer, like, like when my
[33:06.080 --> 33:12.080]  dad was my age, the only, the only beer that there was was the mass market Pilsners, you
[33:12.080 --> 33:14.480]  know, that's, they all tasted the same.
[33:14.480 --> 33:18.640]  Yeah, unless you lived in a small town someplace or people did, you know, the home brewing
[33:18.640 --> 33:23.680]  thing was, was starting up, but those were usually, they were, you know, they're quirky.
[33:23.680 --> 33:27.120]  No, there's never been a, there's never been a better time to have a sophisticated
[33:27.120 --> 33:32.200]  palate probably in the history of the world in terms of, this ties into technology. So
[33:32.200 --> 33:36.020]  you know how Marc Andreessen and other people have pushed these charts that shows how everyone
[33:36.020 --> 33:40.480]  has the kind of stuff that previous generations would have dreamed of. Everyone has a TV,
[33:40.480 --> 33:44.680]  everyone has a DVD. A lot of people have phones, even if they're like living below the poverty
[33:44.680 --> 33:48.440]  line, they have a cell phone on a pay-as-you-go, like all of these certain signs of material
[33:48.440 --> 33:53.260]  success. But this is the, the point that people made about the Apple phone, you have made
[33:53.260 --> 33:58.340]  this point over and over again, is the iPhone is the same price no matter how rich or poor
[33:58.340 --> 34:03.080]  you are. And I think the beverage thing falls in the same thing. You can get, I mean, obviously
[34:03.080 --> 34:07.720]  you can spend a lot of money on beverages, but you can spend a few dollars for a drink,
[34:07.720 --> 34:11.640]  let's say five to ten dollars for a drink and get one of the finest drinks ever made
[34:11.640 --> 34:17.640]  in human history. Now you can go up from there, you can spend $15 for civet poop coffee or
[34:17.640 --> 34:23.440]  whatever for a cup of it and, and a million dollars for champagne, but this lower tier
[34:23.440 --> 34:28.680]  generally accessible, even if it's a special occasion price, is achievable by like most
[34:28.680 --> 34:30.280]  of humanity in the developed world.
[34:30.280 --> 34:38.400]  Yeah, it's amazing. And you know, I think that there was a, I don't know, you know,
[34:38.400 --> 34:44.520]  I think there was sort of a pride in, in post world war two America at the sort of homogenization
[34:44.520 --> 34:49.820]  of culture. And it seemed right. Like when my grandfather was a young man, all the beer
[34:49.820 --> 34:54.200]  came from local breweries, you know, every town of a certain, you know, every town with
[34:54.200 --> 34:59.380]  10 to 15,000 people had a brewery that made the beer for the town. And then in my dad's
[34:59.380 --> 35:06.320]  generation it, you know, the, the Anheuser Bushes and the cores became such a thing.
[35:06.320 --> 35:13.320]  And, and, you know, TV rammed this home that, you know, you didn't drink like, you know,
[35:13.320 --> 35:17.000]  Philadelphia beer, you drank, you know, the same Budweiser that everybody drank. You drank
[35:17.000 --> 35:24.360]  American beer, you know, but it was all all bland, all watered down for the taste, right?
[35:24.360 --> 35:31.160]  I metallic taste in, you know, and, and the, the craft brewing revolution certainly started,
[35:31.160 --> 35:36.360]  you know, I was in college in the late nineties. It had already started, but it was still obscure.
[35:36.360 --> 35:40.280]  And so like when you'd go to parties, if they had beer, it was just, you know, the just
[35:40.280 --> 35:45.760]  cheap bland stuff. So I just thought, I thought, well, I don't like beer like crazy kids, which
[35:45.760 --> 35:51.000]  is crazy in hindsight because I love beer, but I love very particular kinds of beer.
[35:51.000 --> 35:56.440]  And, and I just also think that it's such a, a wonderful world right now for somebody
[35:56.440 --> 36:01.600]  who truly is obsessive about something like that, like Tonks and that he can just go and
[36:01.600 --> 36:06.400]  start his own coffee company. Like, whereas like in the 1960s, that that's not how it
[36:06.400 --> 36:10.700]  worked. You had to be like Procter and Gamble, you know, you need, it was like a billion
[36:10.700 --> 36:14.800]  dollar thing. You know, you couldn't, there was no way for somebody, you know, like two
[36:14.800 --> 36:19.480]  people, you know, to start a business where we're going to send coffee around the world
[36:19.480 --> 36:22.920]  by mail order. There's a great book by an editor I've worked
[36:22.920 --> 36:27.200]  with for years at The Economist, is now the deputy deputy editor, Tom Standage, called
[36:27.200 --> 36:31.560]  History of the World in Six Glasses. It's maybe like a decade old now. And he looks
[36:31.560 --> 36:41.160]  at it's beer, spirits, coffee, tea. What's the other one? There's like, I forgot all
[36:41.160 --> 36:45.800]  six. It's tea and coffee, beer and spirits, and apparently the two. But it's, it's basically
[36:45.800 --> 36:52.040]  a history of how civilization advanced through the perpetuation of certain kinds of drinks
[36:52.040 --> 36:53.040]  because of how
[36:53.040 --> 36:54.040]  What was the name of this book?
[36:54.040 --> 37:00.080]  A History of the World in Six Glasses. And it's six different things, but like tea
[37:00.080 --> 37:04.740]  is an amazing thing because it's got antibacterial properties. It's, you boil the water to
[37:04.740 --> 37:09.080]  drink it. It replaced the small beer, which is like a very low alcohol beer that was drunk,
[37:09.080 --> 37:12.720]  that is given out to factory workers in England and other places. They were given a certain
[37:12.720 --> 37:16.600]  quantity of beer to drink every day. It was very low alcohol, but they were always mildly,
[37:16.600 --> 37:21.840]  you know, inebriated. Tea was a healthful beverage. And it revolutionized factories
[37:21.840 --> 37:22.840]  because people were
[37:22.840 --> 37:24.120]  It focuses the mind.
[37:24.120 --> 37:28.120]  Exactly. But people were living in places with bad water supplies, you know, whatever.
[37:28.120 --> 37:31.920]  So it improved health. So it was healthy, it was antibacterial, and it didn't get
[37:31.920 --> 37:35.920]  you drunk. And so it became the beverage of temperance and so forth. And anyway, it's
[37:35.920 --> 37:42.160]  a lovely book because he argues, and very persuasively, that certain, like the advancement
[37:42.160 --> 37:46.600]  of society isn't, it's not that we got tea because we're at a certain point in
[37:46.600 --> 37:50.120]  civilization where it's possible to have like a global supply chain. It's more like
[37:50.120 --> 37:56.440]  tea actually influenced the industrial revolution significantly, which is cool.
[37:56.440 --> 38:03.560]  Fascinating. I have long들t's one of those things where I've never really done the
[38:03.560 --> 38:08.440]  deep dive, but I will at some point and get a couple of, find a couple of good books on
[38:08.440 --> 38:18.680]  it and really go deep on it. But I, you know, I have a fascination with the prohibition
[38:18.680 --> 38:19.680]  in the United States.
[38:19.680 --> 38:20.680]  Oh, yeah.
[38:20.680 --> 38:24.600]  Because it's another one of those things where it happened, it's seeming, you know,
[38:24.600 --> 38:29.960]  I knew the basic years of when it happened, you know, around 1920 or so, and it only lasted
[38:29.960 --> 38:35.980]  about 12 years. And, you know, it led to the rise of, you know, gangsters who'd run
[38:35.980 --> 38:40.680]  booze into the cities and Al Capone, blah, blah, blah. But as a kid, it just seemed like,
[38:40.680 --> 38:47.680]  well, that was a long time ago, and it's over. But then, when you become an adult and
[38:47.680 --> 38:54.840]  you realize just how, you know, 100 years ago really isn't that long, right, in some
[38:54.840 --> 39:02.440]  ways. And it just fascinates me, like, how in the world did making alcohol illegal ever
[39:02.440 --> 39:07.840]  gain popular support, that they'd pass a constitutional amendment? Like, to pass a
[39:07.840 --> 39:10.920]  constitutional amendment, something has to be overwhelmingly popular.
[39:10.920 --> 39:17.960]  You know what it was? It was fake news, John. It was fake news. It was like mothers spread
[39:17.960 --> 39:22.020]  these, you know, the lies about drinking were spread and believed.
[39:22.020 --> 39:29.680]  In light of our recent election here in the United States and how the fuck did this happen,
[39:29.680 --> 39:36.280]  it's soothing to me mentally to think back to other times where, you know, there were
[39:36.280 --> 39:39.640]  what the fuck were we thinking moments in U.S. politics.
[39:39.640 --> 39:43.640]  We have cycles. Hey, we're about to have our first tea-totaling president, and I don't
[39:43.640 --> 39:44.640]  know how long.
[39:44.640 --> 39:47.040]  That's an interesting thought.
[39:47.040 --> 39:52.480]  He doesn't drink, and, you know, I reflect듒rump has no vices except lying, and he's lying
[39:52.480 --> 39:57.920]  about that, right? But he said he didn't drink, so I assumed it was a lie. It turns
[39:57.920 --> 40:00.720]  out he's absolutely sincere. People have said they've seen him drink in the past,
[40:00.720 --> 40:04.800]  but it may have been decades ago, and there have been confirmation. People have been with
[40:04.800 --> 40:09.160]  him, you know, enemies and friends and people who are former friends. Like, he doesn't
[40:09.160 --> 40:12.480]  drink alcohol. He doesn't seem to have any alcohol, which is드nd it's not a들t
[40:12.480 --> 40:15.640]  doesn't seem to be a moralistic thing. His brother, I mean, he has a family history.
[40:15.640 --> 40:22.200]  Yeah, he had an older brother who, you know, literally a long time ago, I guess, drunk
[40:22.200 --> 40:26.640]  in the early 80s. He died, but he, you know, pretty much drank himself to death.
[40:26.640 --> 40:30.000]  And so, I mean, you know, you can see that, like, there are signs of Trump, like things
[40:30.000 --> 40:35.560]  like that, that I think maybe the man has some empathy, compassion, or at least insight,
[40:35.560 --> 40:41.320]  self-corrective capability, but it is fasting. It is fasting to have a president who, I mean,
[40:41.320 --> 40:44.560]  I don't know how much Obama drank. I think he liked the beverage. You know, he indulged
[40:44.560 --> 40:46.480]  in some cigarettes before he was elected, and then
[40:46.480 --> 40:49.200]  No, he smoked듣e didn't quit until after he was elected.
[40:49.200 --> 40:52.720]  Oh, that's right. And then occasionally, like, there's reports, maybe he sneaked
[40:52.720 --> 40:54.640]  a cigarette here and there at a site.
[40:54.640 --> 40:55.640]  Right.
[40:55.640 --> 41:00.200]  So, it's a mostly quit stuff thing. But it's Trump being a teetotaler. I don't
[41:00.200 --> 41:02.980]  think it'll have any impact. I don't think he's going to go out. He's never been
[41:02.980 --> 41:08.520]  a temperance advocate. But I think when I've read things듣ere's the weird thing about
[41:08.520 --> 41:13.000]  this guy, right? There are times that I read things he says and I go, but this is very
[41:13.000 --> 41:16.720]  reasonable. And I've read things he's said in some middle of long interviews about
[41:16.720 --> 41:21.160]  his brother. And sometimes he's a little harsh about it, but often he's very sympathetic
[41:21.160 --> 41:24.240]  to what the brother went through and very sympathetic to the effect it had on the whole
[41:24.240 --> 41:28.320]  family and how sad it was he died young. And I'm like, all right, well, you know, I like
[41:28.320 --> 41:30.320]  to know there is a human being under there somewhere and that's where it comes out.
[41:30.320 --> 41:35.520]  He is a bit of a cipher. It is one of the weird듈 mean, whether you, you know, again,
[41:35.520 --> 41:42.000]  whether you like him, don't like him, or somehow are indifferent.
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.400]  Very small percentage of Trump voters are actually celebrating, from what I can tell.
[41:45.400 --> 41:48.400]  They're all concerned what's coming next, too, because they don't know if he's
[41:48.400 --> 41:49.960]  going to do what they promised him, either.
[41:49.960 --> 41:53.400]  One of the odd등ell, he's not.
[41:53.400 --> 41:58.360]  One of the odd things about him, though, is that he does듣is personality seems to be
[41:58.360 --> 42:04.960]  a bit of a cipher. You know, whereas Obama, I think, wears his personality on his shirt
[42:04.960 --> 42:09.720]  sleeve, much like Bill Clinton and, I think, too, George W. Bush.
[42:09.720 --> 42:12.400]  I think Elsa, yeah. That's right.
[42:12.400 --> 42:17.760]  You know, I think Hillary is guarded, famously. But there are widespread reports, though,
[42:17.760 --> 42:24.560]  from the people who are close to her that, in person, she's very warm, funny, and empathetic.
[42:24.560 --> 42:30.840]  But on the campaign trail, for reasons that we won't get into, because it's, you know.
[42:30.840 --> 42:42.640]  But she publicly put up sort of a more serious guarded personality.
[42:42.640 --> 42:46.280]  But I'm wondering if we'll see등e'll probably see듮he Hillary in the Woods photos
[42:46.280 --> 42:51.240]  give me life, because she looks like a great weight was dropped off her, despite what's
[42:51.240 --> 42:52.240]  coming next.
[42:52.240 --> 42:56.280]  But you never hear stories about, like, the real Trump from the people close to him. Like,
[42:56.280 --> 42:57.600]  there doesn't seem to be one.
[42:57.600 --> 42:59.200]  There's no real Trump.
[42:59.200 --> 43:03.560]  But talking about his older brother really does듈 do believe듈'm with you, where
[43:03.560 --> 43:07.560]  99% of the stuff out of his mouth, I don't believe. But when he talks about his brother,
[43:07.560 --> 43:11.920]  it seems sincere that he, you know, and that it really did, you know, he saw what happened
[43:11.920 --> 43:13.720]  and he decided, I'm not going to drink.
[43:13.720 --> 43:17.400]  And the other thing that's very self-aware about it that I saw, the New York Times had
[43:17.400 --> 43:21.500]  a good story about this way earlier in the campaign, was the other thing that he said
[43:21.500 --> 43:26.940]  about it was, it wasn't just, well, I saw what happened to my brother and decided not
[43:26.940 --> 43:32.800]  to drink. He also, very self-aware, said, I also know that I'm not much for moderation,
[43:32.800 --> 43:33.800]  personally.
[43:33.800 --> 43:34.800]  You know.
[43:34.800 --> 43:35.800]  Pete lapping his head.
[43:35.800 --> 43:36.800]  Pete lapping his head.
[43:36.800 --> 43:37.800]  Pete lapping his head.
[43:37.800 --> 43:38.800]  Pete lapping his head.
[43:38.800 --> 43:39.800]  Pete lapping his head.
[43:39.800 --> 43:40.800]  Pete lapping his head.
[43:40.800 --> 43:41.800]  Pete lapping his head.
[43:41.800 --> 43:42.800]  Pete lapping his head.
[43:42.800 --> 43:45.900]  So, the man who obviously regarded Trump is fascinating because he's, you know, a bully
[43:45.900 --> 43:50.960]  and a fascist in certain ways, and then he says things like, when it came up about transgender
[43:50.960 --> 43:55.320]  bathroom bills, like in North Carolina and elsewhere, his first reaction, someone asked
[43:55.320 --> 43:58.120]  about it, he said, well, people should go to whatever bathroom they're comfortable with.
[43:58.120 --> 44:01.760]  And I was like, well, that's cool, like, I'm good with that. And then his campaign walked
[44:01.760 --> 44:06.600]  it back and wrapped it and put it into Republican phraseology and, you know, whatever.
[44:06.600 --> 44:10.580]  But his first reaction, you know, is people should just make whatever choice they want
[44:10.580 --> 44:13.300]  themselves. It doesn't really affect other people, which you could argue is a little bit of a
[44:13.300 --> 44:18.180]  narcissist choice too. But it was a more, that was his honest reaction. I'm like, I'm curious
[44:18.180 --> 44:23.700]  how much of that kind of blunt honesty we're going to see versus the, you know, the tendencies
[44:23.700 --> 44:29.700]  towards much worse behavior. I'm not optimistic per se, but I'm trying to be curious because we
[44:29.700 --> 44:34.580]  will see things that are going to be totally unexpected from a Republican elected president.
[44:34.580 --> 44:38.900]  They're going to not conform with any of it. My wife says, she said this a number of times,
[44:38.900 --> 44:43.300]  the reason that we're feeling anxiety, and I think this goes for Trump voters as well. I think there
[44:43.300 --> 44:46.900]  are a number of Trump voters who feel exactly the same way. I mean, some are elated, but I think
[44:46.900 --> 44:52.580]  that's a small percentage compared to the largest number of people who voted for him, is she said,
[44:52.580 --> 44:56.900]  he defeats our ability to predict the future. We all have a little internal prediction capability
[44:56.900 --> 45:01.460]  and he breaks that and you feel anxious. And that's also what people talk about with fascism,
[45:01.460 --> 45:07.140]  not necessarily directly for him, is that fascists and abusive domestic partners and people in those
[45:07.140 --> 45:10.740]  categories, they try to unsettle you. So, you never know what's coming next. So, you live in
[45:10.740 --> 45:15.140]  a constant state of anxiety. I don't think that's his plan, but I think that's how we feel. That's
[45:15.140 --> 45:25.700]  how I feel. That's how my wife feels. How about that technology? How about that new power
[45:26.260 --> 45:33.220]  dual charger? Let's talk about something that we know works. Who says I'm not good at segues?
[45:33.220 --> 45:37.380]  That's great. So, you had a story at Macworld. I think it just came out yesterday.
[45:37.380 --> 45:42.820]  Wait, wait. I want to interrupt you. Segue. Magic Loop, did you see about the ostensibly
[45:42.820 --> 45:46.900]  faked Magic Leap demonstration? No. Tell me about it.
[45:46.900 --> 45:50.820]  You may want to talk about it. I own all the details, but you know, it's one of these new
[45:50.820 --> 45:55.300]  VR things. And Kevin Kelly wrote a really breathless piece earlier this year for Wired.
[45:55.300 --> 45:59.700]  He got a demo. He got to see it. And it's a bunch of super intelligent people involved in it. They're
[45:59.700 --> 46:04.900]  running the lab in Florida away from Silicon Valley. It's supposed to be next level, like
[46:04.900 --> 46:08.740]  whatever everyone's working on now that's being released and demoed, this is the thing beyond it
[46:08.740 --> 46:12.820]  is how it's being hyped. Well, they put out a demonstration video and then it came out that
[46:12.820 --> 46:17.940]  it was actually like a Hollywood-style produced video that does not actually reflect any hardware
[46:17.940 --> 46:22.740]  they have already. So, I was just thinking, when you said segue, I was thinking like, yes,
[46:22.740 --> 46:26.340]  remember how the segue changed the world? Magic Leap is right up there with it. Sorry. That's
[46:26.340 --> 46:33.860]  my segue. There's some sort of tour here in Philadelphia where you can, I don't know if it's,
[46:33.860 --> 46:39.860]  I guess it's history, historic sites, but the historic sites are all very close to each other,
[46:39.860 --> 46:46.580]  frankly. But I see them occasionally where there's obvious tourists with helmets on segues on a tour,
[46:46.580 --> 46:52.100]  you know, like usually somewhere around eight to 10 of them. There's somebody in the front who's
[46:52.100 --> 46:57.620]  clearly the tour leader. And there, it just seems like the dumbest way to get around.
[46:59.460 --> 47:06.900]  Like I do, I love the idea, I'm fascinated by the idea that the thing self-balances on two wheels,
[47:07.860 --> 47:13.460]  but the segues themselves are so stupid. Oh yeah. I mean, it's just, I just remember the whole,
[47:13.460 --> 47:17.220]  the breathless, it's going to change the world. The patent filings are amazing. They think
[47:17.220 --> 47:22.260]  the people investing like Jeff Bezos think this will be, change the way cities are built.
[47:22.260 --> 47:25.380]  Right. Steve Jobs trashed it.
[47:25.380 --> 47:29.460]  Yeah, I'm not surprised. It's like, eh, and it's a really cool scooter that has
[47:29.460 --> 47:33.700]  certain applications. It's done pretty well. Anyway, I'm sorry to interrupt, but Magic Leap
[47:33.700 --> 47:37.700]  just got me with that, you know, like they thought no one was going to figure out it was a
[47:37.700 --> 47:39.940]  faked, you know, or produced demonstration.
[47:41.220 --> 47:45.460]  Do you know what I got? I have the Google Pixel.
[47:45.460 --> 47:47.540]  Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah.
[47:47.540 --> 47:53.700]  Pixel phone. And I got the VR headset. I forget what the, I can't remember what the name of it.
[47:53.700 --> 48:01.140]  They have a Daydream. I haven't used it a lot yet, but it's, it's pretty neat. I mean,
[48:01.140 --> 48:04.820]  I forget how much I paid for the headset, but it wasn't too much. I mean, once you've bought the
[48:04.820 --> 48:12.900]  phone for $800 or whatever it costs, the $75 headset is a neat add on. It's, it's really
[48:12.900 --> 48:18.900]  pretty good. Although it does, it does, Jonas was really into it, but it, it, it does get hot.
[48:19.460 --> 48:26.260]  It eventually, it eventually tells you that it, it couches, it's sort of like, uh, remember when
[48:26.260 --> 48:33.220]  the Wii would tell you to take a break, the Nintendo Wii? It told Jonas to take a break,
[48:33.220 --> 48:39.780]  but it wasn't really for his wellbeing. It was because the phone had overheated and needed to
[48:39.780 --> 48:43.940]  cool down, but it's actually pretty good. The latency is really, really good. Like I was what
[48:43.940 --> 48:49.620]  I thought was wondering if it would pick up. Um, but I can also completely see why Apple hasn't
[48:49.620 --> 48:54.180]  built such a thing. That's not, not ready yet. They want the thing, they want the thing, whatever
[48:54.180 --> 49:00.420]  magically intends to make, which they may not be able to achieve. That's what Apple would prefer.
[49:00.420 --> 49:06.980]  Right. Um, I don't see it. It baffles me that people don't see this in Apple. So I,
[49:06.980 --> 49:11.860]  one of the things when people complain about the new Mac book pros, that they're not pro enough,
[49:11.860 --> 49:16.180]  you know, that the, they're not performance heavy enough. Like they're like other companies are
[49:16.180 --> 49:24.980]  making laptops that you can drive, you know, a high end VR helmets from. Um, and it's like,
[49:24.980 --> 49:29.620]  well, that's, that's, of course they are. Cause that's what, you know, the PC industry always
[49:29.620 --> 49:35.380]  does is build, you know, whatever, you know, you know, that's why gaming PCs exist, you know,
[49:35.380 --> 49:39.860]  that the PC is for some people, it's just a generic box that you can use it to drive
[49:39.860 --> 49:45.700]  any computing task you want. Like that's, that is not what Apple does. Apple doesn't make generic
[49:45.700 --> 49:49.780]  boxes that you can make other things from. If Apple, if Apple is going to make a VR helmet,
[49:49.780 --> 49:54.260]  that the VR helmet itself will be the computer and it will have the graphics
[49:54.260 --> 49:59.940]  in screen that it needs to be. Oh yes, that makes a lot of sense, right? They're not going to make,
[49:59.940 --> 50:06.260]  uh, they're not going to work on making the phone into a, uh, a Jerry rigged VR screen,
[50:06.260 --> 50:10.420]  even though it's possible. And the pixel thing is good enough that it's, you know, it's, it's neat,
[50:10.420 --> 50:14.740]  but it's, you know, you can also, it's also, it's not retina resolution. I mean,
[50:14.740 --> 50:20.820]  you can totally see the pixels of the things that you're, that you're seeing. Um, and it's,
[50:20.820 --> 50:26.180]  you know, it's just clunky to stick your phone into a helmet and same way that it's clunky to
[50:26.180 --> 50:30.980]  have a helmet that's literally tethered to a laptop computer. Like maybe if you hold your
[50:30.980 --> 50:36.740]  watch up really close to your face, it'll send you off. But no, I think you're right. I think
[50:36.740 --> 50:44.820]  it's unlikely Apple, Apple makes, uh, an operating system that is capable of being adapted to a lot
[50:44.820 --> 50:48.900]  of different circumstances, but they don't make hardware that's as general purpose. I mean,
[50:48.900 --> 50:53.620]  I think that's the MacBook pro is really more of a niche computer. Now it doesn't have the same
[50:53.620 --> 50:57.300]  general appeal. I thought that I've been saying that about the 12 inch MacBook since it was
[50:57.300 --> 51:01.300]  released. It's not a lot. It's not a like the MacBook air, which was for a lot of people.
[51:01.300 --> 51:06.020]  The 12 inch MacBook is more particular because it makes you make choices and if it doesn't fit
[51:06.020 --> 51:10.420]  your needs and it's not the laptop for you and the MacBook pro is much more restrained or
[51:10.420 --> 51:16.900]  restricted than the, uh, the previous models of MacBook pro. Um, but speaking of those,
[51:16.900 --> 51:24.100]  well, so you, you wrote a review this week of this, uh, newer tech, new power N U P O W E R.
[51:24.100 --> 51:29.220]  I've already got a link in the show notes. New power. It's a 60 watt power adapter that has
[51:29.860 --> 51:36.020]  two outputs. One of them is a USB, a, the old school USB, and then the other one's USB C
[51:36.020 --> 51:42.100]  and you can use them at the same time. So you could plug this into the wall and then take a,
[51:42.100 --> 51:47.460]  your existing, like the, the cable you charge your phone with, with the U S the rectangular
[51:47.460 --> 51:54.100]  USB, a plug that in, plug your phone in. And then with like a new 13 inch Mac book pro or the,
[51:54.100 --> 51:58.420]  the just plain Mac book, you could charge that from the USB C at the same time.
[51:59.300 --> 52:04.500]  Yeah, it's pretty slick and it comes with a six foot AC cable. So if you're using your six foot,
[52:04.500 --> 52:09.380]  uh, USB C charging cable that came with the Mac book or Mac book pro you have, you know,
[52:09.380 --> 52:13.860]  12 feet suddenly. If you want that from Apple, you have to pay a, the adapter is I think more
[52:13.860 --> 52:18.660]  ungainly B you have to pay a, if you don't have one around, you got to pay a, I think it's $20
[52:18.660 --> 52:24.980]  or $90 to get the six foot extension for the power adapter that comes with your, with your Apple
[52:24.980 --> 52:29.780]  laptop. So I like that. I mean, so right. So it's like a cable, it's kind of like an offset. So if
[52:29.780 --> 52:34.340]  you've got a 12 inch Mac book, sort of ideal because you plug this in to one port and you
[52:34.340 --> 52:40.020]  plug in your, you know, iPad or iPhone to charge the, uh, the new power thing. And you also have
[52:40.020 --> 52:45.140]  six foot of cable beyond that. So you can have your cable, you know, your type a to whatever
[52:45.140 --> 52:51.700]  cable and your laptop cable and along AC cable and it's 50 bucks for the whole thing. So it's,
[52:51.700 --> 52:56.820]  I think it's a great replacement or traveling alternative because it seems to fit all these
[52:56.820 --> 53:01.300]  bases. And 60 Watts is an interesting number because it's clear they designed it more around,
[53:01.300 --> 53:07.940]  um, they're like 45 watt, uh, uh, PCs that this also works with. It works with anything with USB
[53:07.940 --> 53:14.180]  C charging, uh, power, uh, power delivery. 2.0 is the spec, which is a lot of devices. And so the,
[53:14.180 --> 53:19.060]  you know, the Mac book 12 inch Mac book is 29 Watts. There's some 45 watt laptops and so forth.
[53:19.060 --> 53:25.140]  The MacBook pro 13 inch models are 61 Watts, which is crazy, right? Where,
[53:25.940 --> 53:30.820]  I don't understand that Apple's very specific about how they like to map batteries to charging
[53:30.820 --> 53:34.420]  and they just do exactly what they want. It's weird. Well, it's the first one I can think of
[53:34.420 --> 53:39.300]  though. That's such an odd number. Like the Mac book is a 29 Watts charge. I guess you're right.
[53:39.300 --> 53:43.860]  And the Mac book pro is 87 Watts. And somebody told me, I didn't look this up, that the previous
[53:43.860 --> 53:49.380]  Mac book pro the 15 inch one, I'm sorry, was also 87 Watts. So they have, I mean, very specific
[53:49.380 --> 53:56.180]  power profile. They don't like to make a generic charging thing. Um, so this, the new power is
[53:56.180 --> 53:59.620]  probably not appropriate for a 15 inch Mac book pro because it will, it's really hard for it to
[53:59.620 --> 54:04.340]  keep up. If you're doing anything that's pulling power down for the 13 inch, it'll keep up almost
[54:04.340 --> 54:09.620]  as quickly. I mean, you know, 3% off. Um, so it will charge while you're using it and, uh, it
[54:09.620 --> 54:16.260]  might charge a tiny bit slower. If you plug in a USB type a device to charge, it'll take away from
[54:16.260 --> 54:22.500]  the charging, going to the USB-C port. Um, so if you're charging an iPad at 2.4 amps, that's 12
[54:22.500 --> 54:27.540]  Watts at five volts. Um, and that, so that'll be 50, you know, 12 Watts would be subtracted from
[54:27.540 --> 54:31.460]  the 60 if you're doing that and you have a 13 inch Mac book. But I think in a lot of cases,
[54:31.460 --> 54:36.180]  it's a really nice alternative and it's got, you know, it's not a square little thing. It's a,
[54:36.180 --> 54:39.300]  it's like longer, it looks more like a traditional one, but it's very lightweight and it's got
[54:39.300 --> 54:42.740]  rounded edges. The only thing I don't, I think I don't like about it though, is I don't like that
[54:42.740 --> 54:48.020]  to plug this into the wall. You have to use a cable. It has, you know, it's one of the,
[54:48.020 --> 54:53.140]  so this is the brick, but it's, it, you plug a power cable into the back and then it's a six
[54:53.140 --> 54:57.700]  foot cable that goes to the wall. So like there are some cases, some situations where you do want
[54:57.700 --> 55:02.500]  that, but there's others like when you're like, like when I'm in a hotel, usually most hotels now
[55:02.500 --> 55:09.380]  have like a desk where there is like a power on the desk and it's not, you know, like I don't need
[55:09.380 --> 55:13.460]  it. The six foot cable is just going to be in the way there. Like I kind of, I wish that I could
[55:13.460 --> 55:18.980]  just plug that, plug it right in, you know, like it had the prongs on the thing or I think that's,
[55:18.980 --> 55:22.900]  that's the drawback is if that's it, if that's what you want, then you can always carry the
[55:22.900 --> 55:27.300]  original one. But, um, no, I think that that is a drawback cause you get extra cable that way with
[55:27.300 --> 55:31.860]  added option. Um, but I think a lot, I, I, and I have that same issue although I'll get to a hotel
[55:31.860 --> 55:35.380]  and by the time I got stuff plugged in or I figure out when I work, I'm often hunting around for an
[55:35.380 --> 55:39.780]  AC outlet. Um, and some of them have power strips a bit in some newer or not newer hotels, but
[55:39.780 --> 55:44.020]  retrograde ones, power strips. But, or maybe it would be nice if it, you know, again, this would
[55:44.020 --> 55:49.140]  obviously make it a lot physically bigger. So maybe, maybe I'm not thinking it through,
[55:49.140 --> 55:53.700]  but it might be nice if it had one of those cables that you could like, it would retract,
[55:53.700 --> 55:57.380]  you know, like the way like most vacuum cleaners work. Now you can retract the cable.
[55:57.940 --> 56:01.780]  Oh yeah. We're going to see a lot more use USB-C chargers too is, I mean, we're,
[56:01.780 --> 56:05.940]  it's taken the power delivery spec. So I actually interviewed for an article that's going to come
[56:05.940 --> 56:11.140]  out in a fast company about USB-C, like why it's so hard to figure out what cables are good. Like,
[56:11.140 --> 56:17.460]  why isn't there some group? I mean, my conclusion, spoiler, is that the death of magazine test labs
[56:17.460 --> 56:21.140]  is basically why we're having problems with USB-C. Like it's not, so I talked to the head
[56:21.140 --> 56:26.500]  of the USB implementers forum, the USB-IF and the chief operating officer had a great talk about
[56:26.500 --> 56:30.740]  like, where does type C fit into the ecosystem? And what are you guys responsible for? Like,
[56:30.740 --> 56:36.740]  where does your point end? And one of the things the president told me is he said, really frankly,
[56:36.740 --> 56:41.220]  this is a, he said, this isn't your grandma and grandpa's USB 2.0. He said, it's much more
[56:41.220 --> 56:46.340]  complicated. It's much harder to get it right. And we're seeing more problems because it's a much
[56:46.340 --> 56:50.340]  more complicated and difficult spec. It does so much more. And so they're not surprised,
[56:50.340 --> 56:55.620]  but it's what manufacturers want. It's not like the USB-IF invented a difficult spec and it's
[56:55.620 --> 57:00.420]  being inflicted on customers. It's like all of, you know, all the major computer and mobile makers
[57:00.420 --> 57:04.500]  are all involved with USB-IF or they're on the board or they're deeply involved in the standards
[57:04.500 --> 57:09.380]  process. They wanted this to happen. Ultimately in a couple of years, maybe a year, we're all going
[57:09.380 --> 57:13.940]  to be delighted that we have, maybe we still have lightning that seems like it's going to happen,
[57:13.940 --> 57:19.220]  but we have one cable and one thing that works every goddamn place and then new displays will
[57:19.220 --> 57:24.100]  all have USB-C support and new everything will have it. And we'll say, why do we make such a big
[57:24.100 --> 57:29.540]  deal about this? Because the pain of transition and finding the adapters that don't exist and
[57:29.540 --> 57:36.100]  legacy support is a pain, but I think it's really a net positive for it. And so the power part is
[57:36.100 --> 57:40.340]  particularly difficult. There's something called power delivery 2.0, which is as far as I can tell
[57:40.340 --> 57:46.180]  is the first widespread implementation and products of a non-proprietary, a standards-based,
[57:46.180 --> 57:50.660]  but you know, trade group owned, but non-proprietary spec for doing power that's above
[57:50.660 --> 57:55.620]  like 15 to 30 Watts. It can go up to a hundred Watts. There are previous USB specs that allowed
[57:55.620 --> 58:00.260]  this, but from what I can tell, I don't know that many devices use them. They're very specific
[58:00.260 --> 58:04.820]  and you need a specific adapter. This is the first generic way that's already in, you know,
[58:04.820 --> 58:09.220]  millions or maybe even tens of millions of shipping products that supports above, you know,
[58:09.220 --> 58:14.900]  12 or 15 Watts in a standard way and interoperable, interchangeable adapters. So, the ecosystem,
[58:14.900 --> 58:20.740]  I think is about to sort of like, the chip set issue is a big deal. Every, John, you know this,
[58:20.740 --> 58:25.940]  right? Like lightning, every lightning and Thunderbolt 2 cable had a computer in the tip
[58:25.940 --> 58:30.580]  of every cable, right? And so the same thing is true with USB-C and that makes it more complicated.
[58:30.580 --> 58:36.660]  It's all USB-C is like, you're plugging a computer that looks like a cable into your computer's port
[58:36.660 --> 58:40.900]  that has a controller and they have to talk to each other. And so like getting that right
[58:40.900 --> 58:46.740]  means the controller chip sets and the USB-C cable chip sets all have to be in this incredibly
[58:46.740 --> 58:50.820]  perfect alignment. And that is, I think what's been taking so long and we're starting to finally
[58:51.380 --> 58:55.700]  see the benefits of it, you know, already like a, almost two years into the rollout and, uh,
[58:55.700 --> 59:01.140]  next year will be very different. I think one of the underestimated, easily overlooked,
[59:01.140 --> 59:08.180]  but fascinating to me, the things that's going on in hardware everywhere today,
[59:09.780 --> 59:15.300]  whether you're in the consumer electronics business, in the car business, everything,
[59:15.940 --> 59:23.940]  uh, is that every individual component is slowly but surely turning into its own to being a
[59:23.940 --> 59:28.020]  computer. Oh my God. I know. Right. Oh, you're totally right. And I know Joanna Stern and I
[59:28.020 --> 59:33.700]  talked about this, um, about the Mac, about the touch bar, but it's fascinating to me. It just is
[59:33.700 --> 59:38.900]  every time I look at this review unit and I just think about it just pleases me to no end
[59:38.900 --> 59:46.580]  that the touch bar is an iOS computer in my Mac computer. Like I, I find it just makes me smile.
[59:46.580 --> 59:51.860]  I just, it just cracks me up because like, I just like, we were talking about half an hour ago,
[59:51.860 --> 59:58.100]  like when we were kids, like a computer was super expensive. Like, and, and, uh, you know,
[59:58.100 --> 01:00:05.620]  you'd get like 64 kilobytes of memory and it was enough money, right. And, but you know,
[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:10.580]  that it was a lot of money and you had to be very careful and it was quite large. And now,
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:14.820]  now there's, there's, there's a much better computer than that in the tip of your lightning
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:21.780]  cable. The analog to lightning adapter has a GSP in it. I mean, it's a $9 cable and that
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:26.180]  computer is probably more powerful than my first personal computer or maybe even my second
[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:31.940]  personal. I mean, could it do, is it as powerful as a Commodore 64? Maybe not. I'm not sure,
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:35.700]  but it's certainly as powerful as my first computer. In some ways it surely is. There
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:40.660]  are certain, some aspects of it that are surely faster and you know, than a Commodore 64. It's
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:44.100]  crazy. This is like storage, like how many terabytes of storage do you own now personally?
[01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:47.940]  Like 10? I don't even know. You don't even know. I have at least, I don't know, I've got seven or
[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:52.500]  eight lying around, maybe more. And I probably got two or three terabytes in the cloud and we're
[01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:59.300]  going to laugh at how small it is. Like the way that 50 gigabytes seems ridiculously tiny. Like
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:05.300]  I backed up 80 gigs. I added more, I use a backblaze for my desktop machine backup and I'm
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:08.820]  like, oh, you know, I didn't have this part of this drive backed up. So I add it says, oh,
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:14.100]  that's 80 gigs. I got gigabit internet. It added it in like an hour or something. And it just seems
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:18.260]  so laughably small, even though it's enormous. And so, you know, in five years we'll have like
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:23.940]  50 terabytes of storage and we won't be thinking about it much either. Gets bigger. Everything gets
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:32.660]  bigger, faster, better. Let me take a break and we'll come back to that because one of the
[01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:38.980]  computers in our computers now are the computer that's inside AirPods, which still haven't shipped
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:43.940]  and I'd like to talk about that. I'm going to take a break here and thank our next sponsor
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:49.380]  and it's our good friends at Fracture. You know, Fracture, it's the photo company that you send
[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:54.260]  them your photos. They print your photos directly on class. They sponsored the show two episodes ago
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:59.940]  and I told you then, I told you order now for the holidays because they're going to get backed up.
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:04.260]  Well, guess what? They're already backed up. Orders placed today are shipped after Christmas.
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:10.420]  We are recording. You're hearing us record on Friday, December 9th. I'll bet the show
[01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:16.500]  comes out on Saturday, December 10th. So whatever point you're listening to me tell you this,
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:21.220]  if you were going to get people Fracture gifts for Christmas, you had a great idea.
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:24.420]  And if you didn't order them already, I'm really sorry to tell you that you're too late.
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:32.980]  But what you can do, what you can do is you can order gift cards from Fracture. You could give
[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:37.380]  them, you could give out a gift card so that people can print their own fractures. And you
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:43.140]  could do that all the way up to December 19th and still get Christmas delivery. So you could still
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:49.780]  do it. You're not, you're not totally shit out of luck. These are great, great products. So again,
[01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:52.980]  if you're thinking about it for Christmas, too late, hope you listened to me last time. Some of
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:03:00.660]  you probably did. But it's such a great product. Holiday aside, Fracture is just, it's just the
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:05.940]  best way, really is. I would say this even if they weren't a long time sponsor of the show,
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:11.700]  but if you want to print your photos, it's the best way to do it because you don't, there's no
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:16.500]  fuss and they look great. It looks better than putting it on paper and then putting it into a
[01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:21.460]  traditional frame. It looks better and it's easier to deal with because like if you've ever done the
[01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:25.940]  thing where you like, you know, go to Ikea and get a picture frame and then you have a picture
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:29.380]  printed out and you put it in and then you secure the back and then you look at the front and the
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:33.140]  picture's off by like two degrees and you've got to undo the whole thing and put it back in and
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:39.700]  what a pain in the ass. Fractures are just printed right on the glass and they ship in this super
[01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:44.980]  clever little cardboard thing that comes with everything you need to hang it on a wall or to
[01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:49.940]  prop it up on your desk or on a mantle or wherever you want to put it. And it looks so cool because
[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:55.140]  it's just this edge to edge design. There is no frame that's necessary. It's just a piece of glass
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:04:04.420]  with the picture edge to edge. Looks so great. So go check them out. Get your own pictures printed.
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:08.980]  Pick up some gift cards if you want to for the holidays and you haven't ordered already
[01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:17.540]  and go to fractureme.com slash podcast. That's the name. That's the URL. They don't care which
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:23.540]  podcast. It's everybody's podcast gets the same URL. But then when you order, they ask a one
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:27.380]  question survey, which is where did you hear a factor from? And you can tell them you heard about
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:32.500]  it right here on the talk show. My thanks to factor told you it's going to be, they're going
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:37.300]  to get backed up. Listen to me next time. Love their stuff. I need to order some, but I didn't
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:41.780]  need them for presence. So I got to, I'm going to remember that. So Airbnb URL AirPods still
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:47.540]  haven't shipped. As I said, we are recording on Friday, December 9th. And so it's like HBO
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:53.860]  and Westworld. They had to stop production. They had to reengineer the world. They're getting very
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:05:00.180]  close to being, to missing the holidays. I have heard just in the last 24 hours, I have heard
[01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:07.460]  not from like a very well-placed little birdie, but from a birdie, uh, that there's a possibility
[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:12.580]  that there are whispers in Apple among people who work in Apple retail, that they might actually
[01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:17.940]  come in quote unquote the next few days. Nobody has it, but the, I, and I asked and I was like,
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:23.300]  well, is it like a token amount? Like, well, some of them are coming and we're going to sell them
[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:26.820]  to some people, but you've got no chance of actually getting one because they're going to
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:32.740]  be instantly back ordered six to eight weeks. Uh, is it that type of shipping or is it like
[01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:38.420]  you, you have a reasonable chance of getting them, you know, walking into an Apple store and
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:49.860]  walking out with AirPods and the answer was no idea. This is in my opinion, the, the biggest
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:58.180]  Apple screw up in recent memory. I, I gotta, I gotta agree cause, uh, it, so let me, I'm gonna,
[01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:02.980]  the only thing I can compare, I'll compare it to one other thing. And I think that this is worse
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:13.620]  is the, uh, the, I think it was the, the white iPhone four. Oh yeah. So when the iPhone four
[01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:21.220]  came out, that was the one with the glass front and back. And, uh, I think that was the one that
[01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:27.620]  didn't ship right. And, and it, it kind of got lost, I think in the shuffle of antenna gate,
[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:32.740]  cause that was the phone that had antenna gate, but it was supposed to, there were black ones
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:37.540]  and white ones and the white ones are initially, you know, the black ones came out like in June
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:41.940]  on schedule and then Apple said something to the effect of we're having a little problem
[01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:48.580]  with the white production. We expect them in July, uh, like one month late and July came and went
[01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:55.460]  and then antenna gate hit and everybody remembered that. But the white iPhones didn't ship until like
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:07:02.660]  may the next year, April or may like almost a full year. And I remember it vividly because my wife
[01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:09.300]  wanted to get the white one and she waited. And then by the time it got to April or may, she was
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:13.300]  like, well, I'm not, you know, I'm not stupid. I'm not going to buy a new iPhone. Now that new ones
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:19.060]  come out, even though the four S that was when they first moved the schedule back from June to
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:24.420]  like September. So she ended up with her, I think she was using her three GS or whatever for,
[01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:31.220]  you know, two years. Um, but I would say this is a worse mistake because at least with the iPhone
[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:35.300]  four, if you wanted an iPhone four, you could get it. You just didn't get it in the color you
[01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:43.380]  wanted. Whereas it's the, if you want AirPods, you can't get them. Yeah. This is a, it seems,
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:50.420]  it seems bad to introduce something that is a fundamental part of a major change you're making
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:56.580]  and then not have the engineering and production in place to release. It seems like a big, uh,
[01:07:56.580 --> 01:08:01.540]  F up. I was going to say, I want to bump up one level, not to avoid the topic, but I mean,
[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:06.660]  there's always this metaphor, like, you know, Apple is Hillary Clinton, Samsung is Trump,
[01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:10.260]  right? This, you know, without even a political discussion, it's kind of how the coverage went.
[01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:15.060]  And so Apple removes headphones and you have think pieces and whatever. You posted something about
[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:19.460]  this other day. Samsung says, we're not going to have a headphone jack. I'm sorry, headphone jack,
[01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:22.740]  brother. Samsung says, we're not going to have a headphone jack on our next flagship phone.
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:27.220]  Everyone's like, well, it's just Samsung, right? Of course. You're like, but wait, but you're so
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:31.380]  angry. Why were you so angry? Like it's a technology company. It's a decision. There's
[01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:35.940]  all these trade-offs. Why were you so like furious? Like there was white hot fury about it.
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:39.780]  And you could argue it's because there is more of an emotional connection with the iPhone
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:44.020]  and there are fewer models and there is not that emotional connection with Samsung,
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:47.700]  but it is sort of hilarious. But if you're going to take the headphone jack out and you're going
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:52.020]  to deal with the repercussion, cause you know, people have been keyed up to be angry for weeks
[01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:56.340]  and months as the rumors are out there, there is something desperately wrong with that. Something
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:09:00.900]  very bad happened to reach this point. I mean, cause there's no doubt in my mind, I've, I've
[01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:06.340]  talked to several people. Um, you know, I can't say with a hundred percent certainty, but I'm
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:12.660]  as certain as I could be that there was absolutely zero coincidence to the fact that the iPhone seven
[01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:21.060]  is the first iPhone without the headphone jack and was introduced alongside AirPods and W1 chip.
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:25.140]  That was completely in coordination AirPods. They wanted to ship simultaneously. AirPods
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:30.900]  were in development for three years. Uh, engineering and design started three years ago
[01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:36.260]  and it was a year ago when they, they felt like they were at the point where they can say, yes,
[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:43.700]  these will be ready in September, 2016. Therefore we can go ahead with this design of the iPhone
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:48.500]  that doesn't have the headphone jack and you know, this, that, and the other thing are now,
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:52.100]  you know, we can make the camera bigger and move the battery down and this, you know,
[01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:58.180]  all the other side effects of being able to remove the headphone jack, um, was completely
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:03.300]  in coordination and yes, they did not, and they knew, they knew then Apple knew, I didn't know,
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:08.260]  but you know, Apple knew that they were relatively expensive and therefore were not going to be
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:18.180]  included in the box. So even though they're not in the box, um, uh, and cost 150 bucks and
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:22.580]  therefore it, you know, which is a lot to pay for headphones, you know, for, by most people's
[01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:26.580]  standards. Um, and therefore, you know, they knew it's not going to be like everybody with
[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:34.180]  an iPhone seven is going to spend 150 for AirPods. It was absolutely in lockstep with each other that
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:38.820]  they weren't going to ship a phone without a headphone jack, without the new wireless
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:44.660]  AirPods. And they weren't going to ship the AirPods with a flagship phone that still has
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:53.620]  the headphone jack. And so I think if Apple knew, if, if I, I really do think so. I think if they
[01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:57.620]  knew that they were going to be as late as they are, I don't think that they would have removed
[01:10:57.620 --> 01:11:02.900]  the headphone jack this year. Well, remember you look at the design of the phone. Am I wrong?
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:09.140]  My recollection is after the teardowns came out that both phones have technically have room for
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:13.380]  a headphone jack, so they must have given themselves and there's a space where it could
[01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:17.940]  have gone. So they must have given themselves wiggle room at some point. I thought there was
[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:23.460]  room for space where it could be one, maybe I'm wrong. I was wondering how much wiggle room they
[01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:26.820]  gave them because they have to lock in the circuit board design and the, and everything else, you
[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:31.060]  know, phones are locked in very far in advance. Like whatever they're coming out with next year
[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:36.420]  is already completely locked in. I feel terrible for whoever on the team, whichever people on the
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:44.980]  team at whichever levels from top to bottom either made an error in judgment or just were ahead of,
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:49.460]  I mean, this is the thing. So, this will seem like a sidebar, I'll be brief with it. But you know,
[01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:54.980]  I wrote a piece in March, I think for Macworld about why you should probably not become a backer
[01:11:54.980 --> 01:12:00.580]  of Kickstarter and other crowdfunding projects that are, involve mass manufactured items that
[01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:04.980]  aren't totally interchangeable and known like a book. Like everyone knows how to print a book,
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:09.700]  you know, a book printer could be late, but they don't suddenly say, we don't know how to put ink
[01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:14.660]  on pages. We try to put the ink on the pages and the ink fell off and we have to work with you to
[01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:20.740]  develop a new way to put ink on paper because the one you propose doesn't work. So, that typically
[01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:27.140]  doesn't happen. It happens constantly in the production of, you know, especially electronics,
[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:31.380]  but a lot of things where, you know, if you follow the folks at Studio Neat, they have a great
[01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:40.980]  podcast that Mike Hurley is hosting where the two guys, Dan Provost and Tom Gearhart, the two of
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:45.460]  them, wonderful guys, I met them so many times, I'd be embarrassed to make them their names.
[01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:48.980]  Oh, geez. Well, they're lovely people, they do really good products, they're really interesting
[01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:52.980]  stuff they make, and they have a podcast about making their latest thing and talking about it,
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:57.220]  and it's really fascinating because you get the insight into people who do have a, you know,
[01:12:57.220 --> 01:13:02.580]  a moderate-sized company but not a very big one and what the constraints are when you're doing
[01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:08.500]  all of these manufacturing things. So, just sort of backing it out into the like, like,
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:13.940]  so I understand from talking to people at sort of Dan and Tom's level and some folks in bigger
[01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:18.020]  corporations when they'll talk more frankly about like, just what happens when you get from that,
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:22.100]  there's a stage between, I think you've written about it too, people have written articles about
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:25.700]  this, of course, between like, prototype and production. There's this thing where you deliver
[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:29.620]  stuff, you work to get things closer and closer to what's actually on a production line,
[01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:33.300]  then there's a point in which you make units on the production line and they work, and then you
[01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:39.060]  go into this full-scale thing in which there's QA and QC for the products coming off the line,
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:45.140]  right? And it's horrible, and the fact that any consumer electronics company can produce things
[01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:50.340]  routinely on any schedule is always amazing. So, Apple's track record is really good, so is
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:56.100]  Note 7 excluded, but sort of part of it, so is Samsung, so are a lot of other companies
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:14:00.500]  that just produce huge numbers of new models of things, and they're super complicated.
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:05.460]  Even with the Note 7, the problem wasn't with production, the problem was with the design.
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:06.020]  I mean, that's
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:07.300]  Right, they made a bad choice.
[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:12.820]  Right, I mean, I've read enough articles from people who've taken it apart, like,
[01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:17.140]  everybody's in near unanimous agreement about what's wrong. They put too big of a battery
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:22.500]  in too small of a space, and therefore led to the positive and negative sides touching
[01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:25.460]  under physical strain.
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:29.220]  And they, you know, the post-mortem's going to be, they should have realized this in the
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:32.660]  prototyping stage well in advance of going to production and done something about it.
[01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:36.420]  But so, you know, you know all those things. There's this mystery, though. This is what I
[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:40.580]  think Dan and Tom get at well in their podcasts, and you can read stories about this all over.
[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:44.340]  Like, there's this incredible thing about, we know드nd I think it's one thing that
[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:48.740]  Johnny Ives does really well, it's something that I think Tim Cook, as coming from that
[01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:53.860]  deep knowledge of the supply chain and, you know, it kind of got him onto the CEO path,
[01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:57.860]  understanding how you bring different things together and what is feasible.
[01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:01.220]  Kazuma used to consult on this for high-tech companies, where he would
[01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:04.820]  look at what they had in the lab, he would look at what their customers actually wanted,
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:09.300]  and he would help them match those things together, what was feasible and what people
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:12.900]  wanted to turn it into something that was manufacturable or producible.
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:18.580]  It is an incredible art, because you're modeling machines in your head
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:24.180]  that make things on these massive scales. So, it's not surprising this happens from time to time,
[01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:29.060]  it's just Apple is so good at, in general, executing it that something went deeply wrong
[01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:33.140]  when they thought they could make some part of this and it would work 100% of the time,
[01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:36.740]  and they got to it and they're like, this works 98% of the time. It could be as,
[01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:39.460]  it's probably as little as that, too, based on what the reports were.
[01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:45.140]  Brian Smith Yeah, secondhand, talking to a friend who has a friend who works on the AirPods team,
[01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:49.700]  it is, these things are a bitch to manufacture. And they knew it was going to be, but there's
[01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:58.100]  something, you know, some part of, hey, we've got a, you know, I'm holding a pair right here
[01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:03.700]  in my hands, and I'm not trying to brag, you know, but it's very surprising to me that I,
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:07.540]  here we are on December 9th, and I've got AirPods and nobody else does.
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:10.180]  Trenton Larkin It's not late in the process that a problem
[01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:10.660]  occurred. Brian Smith
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:15.940]  You know, I've got right here in my hands proof that there's somewhere there, there's, there was,
[01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:22.820]  you know, by September, there was a factory in China that was pushing out very good,
[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:30.020]  high quality AirPods. And somehow, though, being able to spool that up to, you know,
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:34.420]  punch out the millions of them that they need to punch out, they've run into something.
[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:40.820]  Now, again, I've heard that, and this is from a different source, but I've heard that it's
[01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:45.060]  possible that by the time you even listen to this, they might be out if you're listening like next
[01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:50.980]  week that, but I wouldn't be surprised if, you know, that they get pushed out to January.
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:53.700]  I don't know, something has gone terribly wrong. Trenton Larkin
[01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:57.460]  My suspicion based on the fact that they're able to ship units to you and other reviewers
[01:16:57.460 --> 01:17:02.740]  that from generally reported, you know, I think Matthew Pansarino wrote about this, and I think,
[01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:06.260]  I think you, I forget what your experience has been. They're reliable in your experience,
[01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:08.740]  right? They work pretty much the way you expect them to?
[01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:10.100]  Matthew Pansarino They don't work perfectly.
[01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:18.260]  They glitch occasionally, but if this is as good as the AirPods 1.0 are going to get,
[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:24.020]  if it's, if the exact experience that I've had and continue to have with these is exactly what
[01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:28.820]  everybody would experience, I would still recommend it wholeheartedly. And I would describe
[01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:36.820]  these AirPods as is, occasional problems included, as my favorite new Apple product in years.
[01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:37.220]  Trenton Larkin Oh my god.
[01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:37.940]  Matthew Pansarino I love them.
[01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:40.500]  Trenton Larkin My suspicion is this is a QC or quality
[01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:45.140]  control problem that they, they turned on the volume, they got production units out,
[01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:50.020]  they had some yield issues, but they said we can fix the yields, yield issues in production.
[01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:53.220]  They pulled out the best of them, sent them to reviewers, and then they started turning
[01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:58.180]  the dial up. And when they turned the dial up, the yield was so poor on, which I don't know
[01:17:58.180 --> 01:17:59.180]  what their number is.
[01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:00.340]  Matthew Pansarino I think it's like that. That's what I think
[01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:00.340]  it is.
[01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:01.540]  Trenton Larkin Yeah, because they're that far along. If
[01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:05.220]  they're making something they can send to you, that is not a one-off item, it is something that
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:09.860]  came on a production line, it has to be, it's not a software issue, or yours would be failing
[01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:11.460]  all the time too, and so would all the other reviewers.
[01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:13.380]  Matthew Pansarino Every once in a while, the problems I've seen,
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:18.020]  and they're very similar to what Matthew's seen, every once in a while, but it's been,
[01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:22.580]  it's actually, I use them all the time. They're the only headphones I've used since September,
[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:31.380]  period. Every once in a while, the audio, it just gets a little stuttery. It's like there's
[01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:38.180]  some kind of Bluetooth, you know, somehow the wireless signal gets jacked. And, you know,
[01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:42.500]  usually you can just take them out, put them back in, and, you know, wait a little bit,
[01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:50.100]  and it fixes itself. Every once in a while, one of them drops out, and I've got both in,
[01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:56.580]  but it somehow mistakenly puts itself into, oh, you just want to use one mode, because you can
[01:18:56.580 --> 01:19:00.660]  do that. You can just put one in, and it'll just play through the month. Even though I have both
[01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:05.620]  in, like the audio will stop playing to the right one for a little, and then the way to fix it,
[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:09.940]  or at least I've fixed it, is take them both out, put them in the little Tic Tac case,
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:17.220]  and start over. But only, it's only happened to me like twice, period. And I think that's it.
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:20.820]  I mean, that's pretty much the only problems I've had with it. Every once in a while,
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:26.580]  you know, oh, and the other problem is every once in a while switching from one device to another,
[01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:32.340]  it doesn't go seamlessly. It's not as magic as it should be. That, I think, though,
[01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:38.180]  is more of an iOS problem than a problem with the AirPods, I think. I suspect that software,
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:42.900]  and I've seen that less, so I wouldn't even be surprised if that's actually been fixed in one
[01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:51.140]  of the recent, I'm actually running the betas on all my devices. Like, my phone is still running
[01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:55.060]  whatever the current developer beta of iOS is. So I wouldn't even be surprised.
[01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:56.180]  10.2.2, I think.
[01:19:56.180 --> 01:20:01.940]  I haven't seen that in a few weeks, although I pretty much just use them with my iPhone, too.
[01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:05.220]  This makes me think, you know, actually, as I think about it, I realize because they can push
[01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:10.020]  so much to software and firmware, my suspicion is even further that it's not a quality control
[01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:14.340]  issue. I just realized it's the next level thing, which is they got a bunch of units off,
[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:18.900]  they went through quality control and went through automated testing, they started to pull samples
[01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:24.260]  to test, and they found with samples that the defect rate wasn't being determined through
[01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:28.580]  automatic testing. And then they started to test more, and they realized that the defect rate was,
[01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:34.660]  whatever the defect was, was wider, more complicated, and that whatever QC process
[01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:40.900]  they're using would not be adequate. Because otherwise, if they can make some that are good
[01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:44.820]  and some that aren't, they would have perhaps made a bunch and shipped out a quantity and said,
[01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:49.140]  look, we're getting an early amount out, we have manufacturing problems, we're going to catch up,
[01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:52.420]  we want to get the people who committed to this earliest, we're going to send the first
[01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:57.380]  100,000 out, right? Because even if they lost 100,000, 100,000 units were bad,
[01:20:57.380 --> 01:21:01.620]  and 100,000 were good, they might do it because they do like, you know, they do like to delight
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:06.420]  their customers. That's one thing they do. So my thinking is, they couldn't even get a yield or
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:11.380]  reliability high enough that made them confident they could ship out any numbers in quantity.
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:20.820]  Yeah, until this, and I, they also tend to know how, when they're going to catch up, like,
[01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:27.700]  so for example, with Apple Watch, Apple Watch into, you know, the original one launched and
[01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:36.420]  couldn't meet demand, not even close. But their estimates were, if anything, under promising and
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:43.300]  over delivering. So like, if you ordered an Apple Watch, right when they first started taking orders,
[01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:49.700]  and, and it your, your preferred model said six to eight weeks, you probably got it in like,
[01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:55.780]  five weeks. It seemed, you know, and there were people that push the unpopular model that
[01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:59.620]  developers could get the blue, whatever the parameters were, which was nice. It was like,
[01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:03.380]  we have some that aren't committed, so we're going to make them available to, you know,
[01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:08.260]  and that's how a lot of developers made a lot of friends. And it's also been true, for example,
[01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:12.820]  with the iPhone 7, you know, where there were certain models, you know, the jet black,
[01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:19.700]  and the plus size ones that, you know, if you didn't get your order and write it at midnight
[01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:24.660]  Pacific, you know, you were given a, you know, you're, you weren't going to get it on day one,
[01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:29.940]  but whatever they, whenever they were promising, that's when you got it, you did get it before.
[01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:34.020]  And I, you know, I ordered a couple of them, and one of them, I don't know, six to eight weeks,
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:39.060]  or something like that. And I got it, I got it in four weeks. Oh, wow. Great. So whatever's going on
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:44.020]  with the AirPods isn't like that, you know, like, it seems to me like they aren't willing to commit,
[01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:47.860]  you know, obviously, if, if they could, if they felt like, well, we can't meet demand right now,
[01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:54.180]  but within two months, we will, they'd start out taking orders and say six to eight weeks delivery.
[01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:59.460]  Exactly. And the other thing, too, is that it, whatever it is, it was obviously a surprise. And
[01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:04.420]  it's sort of like an unknown known, you know, I mean, like, they, they, they don't quite have
[01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:11.220]  a handle on the problem, because I expected it, it seemed like Apple expected when the invitations
[01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:17.860]  went out for the Mac book pro event in October, it seemed as though they were expecting to launch
[01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:22.660]  the AirPods at that event, and say they're now available. And that, you know, I think those
[01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:28.900]  invitations as, as per Apple's usual want only went out like a week before the event. So like,
[01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:32.340]  up to like a week before that event, they still thought that they were going to launch in late
[01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:38.820]  October. I also think, you know, so the narrative about Apple always gets spun. They're doomed
[01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:43.220]  because of X, and we don't do that here, because we know, you know, they've got $200 billion in the
[01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:47.620]  bank. And, you know, I've said, I think under the Trump administration, Apple could do very well,
[01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:53.220]  because they will have a deal to repatriate their money, and they'll pay some different tax rate,
[01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:57.300]  and that's probably gonna get solved, right? So Apple have even more money to spend in the US
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:01.220]  that's repatriated, like, you know, they're not going anywhere. But I actually think this is a
[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:06.420]  story that one could argue is the difference between them and Samsung, perhaps, or a sign
[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:10.820]  that Apple is still on the right track, even if maybe they have too much on their plate that's not
[01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:17.060]  executing all in concert, you know, or not anticipating the USB-C adapter negative response,
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:23.140]  then they lowered prices. So Apple didn't ship the AirPods and then say, oops, some of them are bad
[01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:28.660]  and take them into a store and we'll send you a box to return it. They said, we can't ship these
[01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:32.820]  in good conscience because whatever reason. Maybe they couldn't even get them off the assembly line,
[01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:37.380]  which seems unlikely since they had review units. I'm sure they are ramped up to a point to be able
[01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:42.180]  to produce them in the quantities that they needed to ramp up towards. But this tells me they're more
[01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:46.900]  willing to take the hit of customers who are unhappy to get a thing that they want to delay them
[01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:51.140]  by just delaying indefinitely until they know they can deliver something that's
[01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:55.620]  functional. That is a good sign to me, even because you can't always hit on all cylinders
[01:24:55.620 --> 01:25:00.500]  on manufacturing. And, you know, they're losing sales, but are there things that are direct
[01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:05.940]  competitors that someone is saying, I'm canceling my AirPod order to buy this other thing. I think
[01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:10.100]  you just have a delay for most people who are going to be a buyer of it.
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:13.940]  Right, their Apple is really screwed because some people who really want wireless headphones are
[01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:20.580]  buying the Beats. Or they're waiting, Apple's sitting on waiting for, you know, a few million
[01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:27.060]  dollars relative to their multi-billion dollar earnings. So I can see the possibilities would be
[01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:34.660]  the best case scenario is that sometime in the next week, Apple starts shipping them
[01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:42.180]  in significant quantity. And I feel like if that happens, it'll mostly be all's forgiven.
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:46.820]  Although I seriously think that they've shot, one way they shot themselves in the foot is that the
[01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:51.380]  most likely time for someone to buy one is while they're buying their iPhone 7. And so there's an
[01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:55.940]  awful lot of people who would have said, well, what the hell? I'll tack on $150 who now that
[01:25:55.940 --> 01:26:00.420]  their iPhone 7 doesn't even feel that new. It's like, well, that's just my iPhone. They're not
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:05.940]  going to spend $150 on it. But if they can do it in the next week in sufficient quantity,
[01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:12.660]  it's also very clearly a stocking stuffer, right? I mean, like, in every aspect of the word,
[01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:13.940]  you know, it's something
[01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:17.780]  This is an expensive gift you get for듈 mean, this is, you know, $100등hat is it? $200? I forgot.
[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:20.100]  $149. Or $159. $159.
[01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:23.460]  So it's, you know, it's out of the scale of a lot. It's, you know, I don't know what families
[01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:27.460]  have different limits and whatever, but it's like, you know, we got one of my kids드nd it's a
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:33.220]  secret. My son doesn't listen, neither of my kids listen to this podcast, but my older son has a
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:34.260]  I hope so.
[01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:37.620]  I hope so. I don't think they listen to the podcast when they get older. They listen to
[01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:41.380]  the game show episodes of The Incomparable where some of the hosts will say, oh no,
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:47.300]  Glenn's kids are listening, you know, clean it up. But so, my older son has a great proclivity
[01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:52.900]  towards music. He is, thank God, not a prodigy because we know happy lives and prodigies do not
[01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:56.500]  go together. But he has skipped. He's a musical talent. It's really neat. And he's been
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:27:00.980]  learning a bunch of instruments and his flute is his primary one, but he suddenly got interested in
[01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:06.100]  the trombone. And I'm like, okay, I guess we have a small house, but you know, I love hearing him
[01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:09.860]  play. Okay, you know, and we got a mute for it. So his mother-in-law, or my mother-in-law,
[01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:14.980]  father-in-law got that as a gift, which is, you know, got a modest model on sale and whatever,
[01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:18.980]  but it's a pricey gift and he'll appreciate it. So that's kind of, you know, that's out of our
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:22.020]  usual scale, but the grandparents are allowed to do that and they asked.
[01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:23.060]  Well, if you look it up
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:26.180]  But like, you know, AirPods등e didn't get him AirPods, let me just tell you that.
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:31.220]  Right. If you look등ell, no, nobody's getting AirPods for good, at least not yet.
[01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:34.740]  I'm getting earplugs, though. That's going to be my gift.
[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:38.900]  If you look at the iPod's sales history, I mean, there's a lot of reasons for the
[01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:42.420]  reasons that ramped up, that the first few years it was a Mac-only product and
[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:49.700]  et cetera. But it's when they found good models that could hit that $199 price point is really
[01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:55.860]  when it exploded. There's something magical about sub-$200 in terms of, okay,
[01:27:55.860 --> 01:28:02.820]  this isn't something, you know, we'll들t's not a lark, but it's, you know, a gift. So $159 would
[01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:07.940]  be great. If they can do it this week, it'll, you know, in quantity, that would be great. That's the
[01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:14.500]  best case scenario and I think it's mostly all's forgiven. If they ship it in the next week or so,
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:19.860]  but it's not in sufficient quantity and it's six to eight weeks backordered past the holidays
[01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:26.340]  for just about it for all practical effects, that sucks. And that's obviously a huge mess for them.
[01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:34.740]  Getting these things out in time to ship for the holiday is huge. There's just no doubt about it.
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:40.260]  It's one of those items that's going to sell in that spiky,
[01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:45.140]  whoa, look at the fourth quarter sells double what it does in the other three quarters of the year
[01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:51.140]  type product. And then the third I think it was a pull, though. It was a pull, though, too,
[01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:55.620]  when people bought AirPods. They thought AirPod plus the new phones. So some people delayed
[01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:59.380]  getting a new phone until they could get AirPods. Third case scenario would be it doesn't even ship
[01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:06.180]  in low quantity this month. Oh my god, yeah. And there was듌acRumors had a story, you know,
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:11.060]  somehow sourced to the supply chain that it's been pushed back to January. And then the next day,
[01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:17.140]  they had a counter story that said, no, no, it's shipping soon. That's really embarrassing.
[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:23.300]  And then I guess, in terms of what's actually possible, you can't say it's impossible that
[01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:31.220]  they'd never even ship them. Oh, man, that would be very bad for confidence. Not on the financial
[01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:36.580]  side, a bit, very small, but the confidence of it would be I guess it never seems impossible,
[01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:42.900]  but what if it doesn't ship until July, like the white iPhone, right? It would just become an
[01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:46.980]  albatross, right? It's a very beautiful bird, but it's flying, not so much when it's hanging
[01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:52.740]  around your neck. Again, it does not doom the company, but this is At this point,
[01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:59.780]  I feel like듃ecember 9th, I mean, it's probably too close. I mean, we're talking
[01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:06.020]  16 days till Christmas. There could be a bunch of people in a factory in China very delicately
[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:10.420]  opening up things and fixing a tiny thing or testing them one at a time.
[01:30:10.420 --> 01:30:14.740]  I don't know this, but I certainly would, I would bet heavily that there are some
[01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:20.340]  normally Cupertino residents who are spending on
[01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:25.060]  Do you remember that story about Tim Cook? It was a great story. I think it was
[01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:25.460]  You tell it.
[01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:28.980]  듮he thing. Yeah, it's the듮hey're having that meeting. I can't remember the specific
[01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:33.380]  problem. Something was going on in China that was problematic. He's sitting there as CEO.
[01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:37.140]  The person at the table explains it, and they go in the meeting, and at some point,
[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:41.380]  Tim looks at him and says, why are you still here? And the guy walked out and, like,
[01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:44.500]  literally got on a plane to China to take care of the problem. I'm telling it right,
[01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:45.140]  right? It's close to that.
[01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:49.380]  Yeah, yeah. Somebody, you know, Tim said, okay, well, you're responsible for fixing it. You'll,
[01:30:49.380 --> 01:30:54.020]  you know, you'll have to go there to fix it. And then the meeting keeps going, and the guy didn't
[01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:59.620]  get up, and then Tim Cook says, why are you still here? And so the guy realized that that's how
[01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:04.260]  quickly he wanted him to go. And he drove듣e didn't go home and pack. He just drove to the
[01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:08.100]  airport and figured he'd get clothes, you know, once he gets to Beijing.
[01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:09.940]  You can buy clothes in China, I've heard very easily.
[01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:10.440]  Right.
[01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:16.340]  So I like that it also wasn't that Tim was, you know, screaming and red-faced at him. He's just
[01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:23.140]  like, why are you still here? I thought that, that to me set a tone for the Tim Cook administration.
[01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:29.300]  And I think it's followed through pretty well that we expect that he holds people responsible
[01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:32.900]  without it, you know, for the right reason. When things aren't working, it's going to get fixed.
[01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:38.260]  And that's what this feels like from the outside, that there's a bunch of people who are, you know,
[01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:41.780]  like, we got to get this fixed so I can be with my family at the holidays at the end of the year.
[01:31:41.780 --> 01:31:45.300]  Yeah. All right, let me take a break here and thank our third and final sponsor,
[01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:51.700]  another longtime sponsor of the show with just a fantastic service, MailRoute. You know who
[01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:56.740]  should handle your email security and delivery? People who only do that. That's MailRoute. This
[01:31:56.740 --> 01:32:01.300]  is what MailRoute does. All they do is they don't host email. They don't host your email. All they do
[01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:07.780]  is filter it for you. Take all the junk out. So what the way it works is pretty simple. If you
[01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:13.700]  control a domain where you get email, whether you're a big company, like they do stuff for
[01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:20.900]  huge companies or whether you're like me and I've got like the only person who has at during
[01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:27.700]  fireball.net email, it doesn't matter, big or small, you just point your MX records for the
[01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:33.140]  domain to go to MailRoute first. Your mail goes to them first, they filter out all the junk,
[01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:36.740]  and then they immediately, you know, we're talking like a hundredth of a second later,
[01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:43.060]  it forwards on to your actual mail server. So from the outside, the MX records point to MailRoute.
[01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:47.300]  Then it goes to MailRoute and it's just a filter, literally. It's just the filter. And then the
[01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:54.020]  actual good email just goes right to your server. So it doesn't even take any longer other than
[01:32:54.020 --> 01:33:01.140]  like fraction of a second. But all of a sudden, your email has no junk, no garbage. It just works.
[01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:06.900]  And that's all they do. This is all they do. It's a fantastic service and it really works great.
[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:11.940]  And all sorts of other companies are getting out of the email protection business because it's such
[01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:19.300]  hard work. Postini went away. McAfee's thing went away. MX logic went away. This is a tremendous
[01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:23.620]  service. There's no hardware or software to install. It's not like you install new software.
[01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:30.660]  You just point your domain at them. So it doesn't matter what you're using for your email. It
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:35.300]  doesn't matter if you're using like Microsoft stuff in a corporate environment or even if
[01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:42.100]  you're hosting on Google apps or something like that. So whether you're a small home business or
[01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:47.620]  a huge ISP, MailRoute handles customers of all sizes and provides the same level of outstanding
[01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:53.220]  tech support to everyone. They send you anything you'd think you'd want with a service like this.
[01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:59.300]  Like you want to get a report every day with like the mail that got filtered so you can like
[01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:03.780]  eyeball it and make sure that good stuff isn't getting caught. You can do that. It's so great.
[01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:09.700]  And it's just completely focused on this one thing, which is filtering the junk out of your email.
[01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:18.180]  I don't know what else to say about them. If you control the email for one or more domains,
[01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:25.380]  I really, really recommend that you look at it. They even give you a 30-day free trial.
[01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:31.300]  So you can go there and just in the time it takes to change the MX records for your domain,
[01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:36.020]  there you go. You're set up and you can go and try it out and see that it actually works before
[01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:41.860]  you even give them a nickel. And then once you do start paying, go to mailroute.net slash TTS,
[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:48.580]  TTS, the initials for the talk show mailroute.net that TTS. And if you've used that URL to get
[01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:55.700]  started, you get 10% off for the lifetime of your account. So like, if you're using for like the
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:35:01.380]  next 15 years, every single month, when you pay them, you save 10% because you started by going
[01:35:01.380 --> 01:35:07.540]  to mailroute.net slash TTS. So my thanks to them. Go check them out. Highly, highly, highly recommend
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:16.980]  them. What else is going on? You see this thing where Apple launched their TV single sign on?
[01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:22.580]  Yes. Yeah, they sort of launched. Yeah, they launched it. All right. I'll give them that.
[01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:26.740]  They did launch it. So John Pachkowski put it well in a tweet. So just the other day,
[01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:33.220]  Apple launched the single. This is the thing where you can use your cable service username and
[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:44.420]  password to sign in. And then all of the apps on your Apple TV that require a cable service thing
[01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:49.940]  to get, you don't have to log into each one of them individually and type the four digits from
[01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:56.180]  your phone and blah, blah, blah for each app over and over again, you sign in once at a system level
[01:35:56.180 --> 01:36:02.260]  and then the apps just pick it up and then they just work. The problem is that they launched it
[01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:06.660]  and they don't have Comcast. They don't have Time Warner Cable. They don't have Fios. They don't
[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:12.660]  have on the content side. They don't have ABC, CBS, or ESPN. They don't have HBO Go.
[01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:21.300]  So it's launched. And I guess the big ones that I can see in the list, and maybe I'm
[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:25.940]  underestimating some of the ones. I've never heard of some of these like Hawaiian Telecom.
[01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:32.820]  Well, I guess it's probably local to Hawaii. The ones I've heard of are DirecTV and Dish.
[01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:41.460]  So if you have satellite TV through DirecTV or Dish, you're in. But without Comcast and Time
[01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:46.660]  Warner and Fios, boy, that's, it's, I mean, and hopefully this is one of those things that it's
[01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:53.060]  just takes time to get these people on board. And maybe it's not even so much that they're
[01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:58.500]  reluctant to sign up, but that they're, they just need time to get it integrated on their backends.
[01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:03.780]  But this doesn't look good either because this was announced at WWDC,
[01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:10.180]  I think, right? And it was emphasized and reiterated in the iPhone event in September
[01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:14.500]  that later this year, we're going to, you know, roll this out. This is when they announced that
[01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:24.100]  the video app is renamed to TV on iOS. It was announced and I don't, you know, if this is all
[01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:28.020]  they're going to have by the end of the year, boy, that's, it's nowhere near what they were
[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:32.340]  promising in September. So this is another one where I feel like Apple is really falling short.
[01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:36.580]  I wouldn't have thought they would have announced it when they did unless they had
[01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:41.220]  all the biggest services signed on, especially HBO. They have a partnership
[01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:47.220]  with, although, I mean, I guess it's HBO via these providers, so the provider is still the issue,
[01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:53.380]  but HBO's app is not listed. So conceivably, even if HBO and the providers couldn't get a deal,
[01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:57.860]  then, you know, maybe HBO has contracts that prohibit them unless providers agree.
[01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:03.540]  Some of the apps are iOS only and some are TVS only. Most are, most of those are,
[01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:11.380]  that are some one platform only TVS, TVOS as well. It is weird because it seemed,
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:16.180]  I mean, if you didn't have Comcast and Time Warner, why wouldn't you have,
[01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:19.460]  why would you have launched, why would you have announced this like for pressure?
[01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:24.580]  Like, well, we'll get some of the big ones, you know, they have some of them. I mean,
[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:28.500]  DirecTV makes sense because the AT&T connection and all that, but it just, it's,
[01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:34.980]  uh, it's, it seems to me to go hand in hand with the AirPods in terms of that. It seems
[01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:40.260]  like they were taken by surprise. Like they thought that they had this and it ends up,
[01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:45.060]  they don't, whether it's a negotiation thing that wasn't finalized or if it's a technical thing
[01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:48.740]  or a little bit of column A and a little bit of column B, it seems to me that in September,
[01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:54.100]  they thought they were going to have this by, you know, around now, end of, end of November,
[01:38:54.100 --> 01:38:58.820]  very early December. And they don't. Well, we've heard, you know, about, uh, any key showing up
[01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:05.140]  with an untucked shirt and pissing off a famous detail and pissing off TV or, you know, exactly.
[01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:08.740]  I think it was Time Warner. Right. It was time. Yeah. Yeah. And it's like, I mean, there is a
[01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:13.140]  little, I don't, I'm not going to credit that with being how real a thing that was. Cause that came
[01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:19.460]  from the cable side, not from the Apple side or whatever. Um, but, uh, it may be that they were
[01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:24.340]  just, you know, they've, Apple has been able to bowl through a lot of deals on the advantage of
[01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:29.380]  bringing a ton of users along and it being a net benefit for subscriptions. Um, there's this
[01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:36.420]  related discussion that was it just on TV OS that Apple may drop the fee for subscriptions from 30%
[01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:44.420]  to 15%. So, which would be, it's a nice big carrot to give to any of the, um, cable, uh, cable
[01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:49.940]  networks. And, um, I'm always confused about exactly, I don't follow this closely enough, which
[01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:55.700]  premium channels are owned by which cable or media company. And because the cable companies now own
[01:39:55.700 --> 01:40:01.060]  sort of chains of media companies, it's all slightly interrelated there, uh, too. So
[01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:08.820]  in some cases you're like, all right, well they, you know, Comcast is, uh, um, all the
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:12.340]  different providers are going to move. I mean, everyone knows that eventually it's going to be
[01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:16.500]  unbundled, right? Very, everything's going to be unbundled. They're all fighting against it as hard
[01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:22.660]  as they can, but we've seen all the cracks and AT&T is new direct TV. Uh, now deal is a part of
[01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:27.780]  it. It's not necessarily even financially fantastic unless you do the early signup deal,
[01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:32.340]  uh, the $35 for a hundred channels, like, you know, lock in like that's a good deal, I think.
[01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:37.380]  But, uh, we're, we're going to come to a world in which bandwidth is one thing. Uh, I've got my
[01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:42.820]  gigabit internet as long as it lasts from CenturyLink, which is a, you know, bottom tier
[01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:48.020]  telco that is, has a lot of, uh, uh, copper installed. So they're trying to switch to
[01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:52.020]  fiber, but I have to hope they actually survive and this is viable. Uh, but you know, even
[01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:57.220]  Comcast is delivering higher speeds or delivering higher caps. There's all these zero rating issues
[01:40:57.220 --> 01:41:01.700]  that are coming up with AT&T in terms of how they'll count, uh, direct TV streaming over
[01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:05.620]  wireless. Like there's a whole swirling miasma of things. And I would have thought in the middle
[01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:11.140]  of this that Apple would have been a great tool for the cable operators to extend the value and
[01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:17.620]  for the cable channels they own, which are many of them to, you know, have more people signed up in
[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:23.060]  various ways. So it's baffling to me as a result. And the single sign on thing seems to me like,
[01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:27.620]  why not? Like if you were at Comcast, like if you've all of a sudden you're an executive at
[01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:34.660]  Comcast, I can see where they're wary of things that enable cord cutting, right? Cause they don't,
[01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:40.660]  they, you know, they want to fight that and they want to milk the, uh, we have these customers
[01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:46.180]  paying us a hundred and some dollars a month, every month for cable TV and that's a really
[01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:50.820]  nice deal and we want to keep that going as long as we can. But the single sign on is based on
[01:41:50.820 --> 01:41:56.420]  that, right? It's based on the idea that you're still paying for a monthly thing, right? It's not
[01:41:56.420 --> 01:42:03.220]  a cord cutting thing, so why not get on board with it? I don't quite get it unless it's just
[01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:07.620]  technical problems. Because I can do it now, right? Comcast, I can use a Comcast sign in for
[01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:12.260]  all sorts of things already. They're not preventing me from doing it. This just makes it
[01:42:12.260 --> 01:42:16.420]  harder, right? Right. It's exactly it. Right. It's just making something easier for the,
[01:42:17.460 --> 01:42:22.260]  for the person, you know, for the user that, that you can already do. I already have on my,
[01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:29.220]  I have Comcast service and I have an Apple TV and I have at least a handful of apps from cable
[01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:34.900]  channels like HBO, the main one, where I have to sign in with my Comcast credentials to prove that
[01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:40.420]  I have cable. This would just make it easier and I, so it's, it's a little frustrating to me.
[01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:43.940]  I have to believe that Comcast and some of the other big ones think they're going to lose
[01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:49.860]  some kind of audience presence to Apple by allowing Apple to overbrand it. There's also the,
[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:54.500]  the melding of it, right? The TV app is going to, going to, well, that's different though. Again,
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:43:00.180]  I can see why they're not participating. You know, like Netflix in particular is, is a holdout on
[01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:03.060]  that. And speaking of Netflix But you're right, but these other, these other things will though,
[01:43:03.060 --> 01:43:08.180]  right? I mean, the TV app will include a lot of like stuff drawn from all these other apps,
[01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:12.100]  so it's not necessarily a perfect overlap that they're not allowing this. It just seems,
[01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:16.180]  it seems inconvenient instead of a strategy. So I have to believe there's something we don't
[01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:20.340]  understand. Let's not just peak or there's some money that should be changing hands that Apple
[01:43:20.340 --> 01:43:24.580]  doesn't want to pay or Comcast, et cetera, thinks they're losing out somehow.
[01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:29.540]  I saw the other day that Netflix became the top grossing iOS app. And now I just looked
[01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:34.100]  as we were talking and it's slipped to number two behind Clash Royale.
[01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:35.540]  Interesting.
[01:43:36.100 --> 01:43:40.340]  But it's, you know, now that they, because it used to be that they didn't take signups,
[01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:43.140]  because I guess they didn't want to split the money with Apple. You had to, you know,
[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:48.740]  sign up for Netflix outside of iOS in a web browser, and then you could sign in with
[01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:54.180]  your credentials. But now that they're taking the, the in-app purchases, they're the number
[01:43:54.180 --> 01:43:58.740]  two grossing app and that's only counting the people who are paying through iOS,
[01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:03.780]  not all of the, all of us who've been signed up for Netflix for years aren't even in there.
[01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:08.180]  So in terms of like, Hey, is Netflix doing well? That looks like they are,
[01:44:08.180 --> 01:44:12.820]  but I'm curious, this is one of those things that I've sort of lost track of is that whole,
[01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:18.980]  okay, we're going to give some of you guys, big name TV channels in 85-15 split instead of 70-30.
[01:44:18.980 --> 01:44:24.820]  Like did Netflix get in on that or were they too soon? Like is this based on an 85-15 split
[01:44:24.820 --> 01:44:29.940]  or 70-30? I don't know if anybody knows that other than, you know, Apple and Netflix.
[01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:34.580]  I don't think I've seen anything that's even hinted that someone knew which ones were involved.
[01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:38.660]  And I have to believe, see for Netflix has an interesting situation like Apple doing that
[01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:43.460]  second year subscription price, you know, they're only paying a 15% commission now.
[01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:47.540]  Like that's part of, that's a change I think a lot of people found significant worthwhile,
[01:44:47.540 --> 01:44:51.860]  especially in the, for smaller companies or some of the bigger ones that sell subscription stuff
[01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:57.860]  and really rely on the, on in-app purchases or in-app based purchase system. But the
[01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:05.060]  Netflix may have reached a point where it has saturated its ability to acquire a market from,
[01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:10.740]  or to acquire customers in a way that they know the cost is going to be lower than 30%.
[01:45:10.740 --> 01:45:15.060]  So, if they're not getting 15%, they may have said, all right, we now need to sweep in people
[01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:18.660]  that we're not getting. Our numbers, our spreadsheet shows that giving up an extra
[01:45:18.660 --> 01:45:23.700]  15% here is worthwhile for the first year because pencils out good for us and we get the money in
[01:45:23.700 --> 01:45:27.460]  the second year. And some of these people may unsubscribe and resubscribe through the website
[01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:31.540]  because they're not our customers and, you know, it all works. It's all good now because we're in
[01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:35.620]  the last X percentage of people we can reach. Yeah. And they seem to have done pretty well
[01:45:36.340 --> 01:45:42.660]  with a fairly liberal policy of shared accounts. You know, that they're not real,
[01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:48.900]  doesn't seem like they're big on trying to lock down like, you know, three or four people sharing
[01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:53.300]  an account. Right. Across a bunch of, because it seems like they're, you know, they have the right
[01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:59.540]  idea, which is, look, somebody's paying us 10 bucks a month or whatever it is and multiply it
[01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:04.580]  by the number of X millions of other people who are paying us 10 bucks a month. If, you know,
[01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:11.220]  there's some leakage here of shared accounts, who cares? The money coming in is great and growing
[01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:15.460]  and the content, you know, what we're paying for the content is here. So we're, you know,
[01:46:17.860 --> 01:46:21.780]  you know, it seems like they've always had a good balance on that front.
[01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:26.180]  Yeah, I agree. I agree. All right. Last topic I can think of is you want to talk about Farhad,
[01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:31.300]  Manchu's column this week in the New York Times, which was the death of gadgets.
[01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:36.420]  Yeah, I kind of liked this piece because I realized it seemed like, I'm trying to think
[01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:40.900]  how many years ago it's occurred to me. I think when Gizmodo said that they were going to sort of
[01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:45.620]  change how they approached what they were doing with reporting and structure, was that like three
[01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:49.300]  years ago now? I'm thinking. Yeah, maybe. I don't know. There was a point at which it seemed like
[01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:53.700]  gadgets started to go away, like the obsessive focus on gadgets. There was something Gizmodo
[01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:58.020]  was the first, and then there was Engadget, then there was Gadgets, and then there were, you know,
[01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:03.460]  a thousand, thousand blogs that were devoted to obsessive coverage with as much leaked information
[01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:07.780]  and unboxing and everything as possible. Every little doodad that came out. And I'll tell you,
[01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:13.140]  like, even on my now dead, I mean still archive, wifi networking news site, one of the most popular
[01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:18.100]  things I ever posted there was a tiny, it was a post, a tiny video about this thing called
[01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:23.780]  Canary Wireless something, and it was like a tiny standalone device that would show you what wifi
[01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:28.100]  networks were around you. It was like a handheld wifi detector, and it would list off the networks
[01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:34.020]  on an LED display, or a LCD display. And I mean, that still gets traffic, which is weird to me now.
[01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:42.020]  But people were obsessed with Gadgets for the longest time, and it really did, you know, it was
[01:47:42.020 --> 01:47:47.220]  a proven way to get traffic, and it was a proven way to get advertising, the whole ecosystem worked
[01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:52.580]  and some of these sites became super highly trafficked. And then I felt like it shifted.
[01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:55.700]  I felt like people were less obsessed with it, and I was like, well, what really happened? Do
[01:47:55.700 --> 01:48:01.220]  people have enough Gadgets? Like, has that run out? Are we replacing single purpose things with
[01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:06.180]  multi-purpose things? And it slowly kind of ebbed away, and I think, I feel like Farhad put a really
[01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:12.100]  good cap on it, the gadget apocalypse is upon us, is his head, right? And it starts out, remember
[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:17.300]  Gadgets. And I thought, you know, this is a good concept. He's like, we had decades in which like,
[01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:21.620]  transistor radios, oh, do you remember, the big thing to me was, do you remember the flip? How
[01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:26.660]  quickly the flip died? It was this giant thing, right? And then everyone, I'd never heard of it,
[01:48:26.660 --> 01:48:30.340]  suddenly everyone has one, suddenly they flame out. It was incredible.
[01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:42.180]  Well, here's what I did. I think that part of this is that the smartphone is the Uber gadget.
[01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:47.300]  Yeah. Right. And, you know, for example, that's exactly what happened. Flip is it got killed by
[01:48:48.260 --> 01:48:53.060]  it got killed by the phone. And I think a lot of other things have to transistor radio. I mean,
[01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:57.140]  it's everything, right? It's our camera. It's our Walkman. It's our iPod. It's our,
[01:48:57.140 --> 01:48:59.940]  it's our newspaper. It's, you know,
[01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:04.500]  HD radio, satellite radio. I mean, satellite radio thing is doing okay. I mean, it's not small,
[01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:08.580]  but it's not as I think it had a bigger arc. Yeah, but you can get my wife listens to XM on
[01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:12.580]  her iPhone, right? It was just smart for the smart for they don't, you know, much the satellites cost
[01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:16.340]  to launch made a failure with some of their satellites with a Boeing issue. I mean, there's
[01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:21.060]  satellites are not a great way to run a business. But like pebble, you know, this was precipitated
[01:49:21.060 --> 01:49:26.660]  by pebble getting bought by Fitbit and then saying, Well, you know, we don't know how long
[01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:29.780]  we're not we're not going to make or ship any more watches. Yeah, they didn't really it's not
[01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:35.060]  like they sold it as a platform. They it's more or less an aqua hire where exactly where Fitbit
[01:49:35.060 --> 01:49:42.340]  bought their engineering and whatever, but it had no, it had no future with with the between smart
[01:49:42.340 --> 01:49:48.260]  watches from major vendors like Apple, and iPhones and smartphones that have more capabilities,
[01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:52.980]  like what's going to happen with Fitbit, what's going to happen with, you know, then nest,
[01:49:52.980 --> 01:49:59.860]  there's a lot of discussion about what happens to nest. Does it have a future exactly? You see,
[01:50:01.380 --> 01:50:05.700]  there's a story I had missed this and I felt sort of feel sort of terrible on 3d robotics was
[01:50:05.700 --> 01:50:10.660]  founded by as a drone company, personal drone company founded by Chris Anderson, and a partner
[01:50:10.660 --> 01:50:14.420]  and Chris used to be the editor in chief of wire and a few years ago, he left wired to take over
[01:50:14.420 --> 01:50:22.740]  full time. They raised $100 million in venture, they tried to produce a super premium drone that
[01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:26.580]  would be like, they kind of move from kits and other stuff to a super premium drone.
[01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:30.580]  They had a lot of problems in production by the time they got to kind of a point where things were
[01:50:30.580 --> 01:50:37.220]  okay. China had basically caught up like cheap production in China had overtaken their ability
[01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:43.780]  to make something that was competitively priced. And that's part of the story. So that is part of
[01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:47.620]  the issue is anything you can make like you look at nest, you're like, well, I could pay $200. I
[01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:51.780]  think it's still for the first unit, you can get IP cameras that don't have the same cloud
[01:50:51.780 --> 01:50:55.620]  functionality or different and have horrible security problems, but they cost like 30 bucks,
[01:50:55.620 --> 01:51:01.300]  you know, and they're slightly worse. It's the not quite good enough, but not so horrible that
[01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:07.540]  people just completely abandon it kind of thing. And that's, you know, we've got the far ahead
[01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:11.860]  list up a bunch of stuff, but it's a good tie together like MakerBot, not really getting to
[01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:18.900]  level that and it's sort of sad because gadgets kind of drove the entire electronics and
[01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:23.620]  technology industry. We've always loved them. But yeah, you know, we saw this happen with
[01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:29.140]  snapshot cameras. Snapshot digital cameras are not dead as category, but they might as well be.
[01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:35.540]  And even DLSRs have been eaten away. It's not necessarily, you don't choose between a $5,000
[01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:41.220]  DLSR and a, you know, smartphone, but mirrorless cameras, which are much less expensive,
[01:51:41.220 --> 01:51:43.540]  or can be much less expensive, I think I've eaten away there too.
[01:51:43.540 --> 01:51:47.540]  I think another thing with cameras is, in addition to being eaten by the phone
[01:51:47.540 --> 01:51:52.260]  at the consumer end, at the high end, they've also reached a point where the rapid increases
[01:51:52.260 --> 01:51:59.140]  in the digital quality have slowed, where you're, it's more like the film days, right? Like in the
[01:51:59.140 --> 01:52:04.580]  film era, you could get, you could be like a serious, even a professional photographer and
[01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:10.020]  not buy new equipment for long stretches of time, right? Until they break, because number one,
[01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:14.820]  the high end stuff is usually built to last, really great build quality. And the technology
[01:52:14.820 --> 01:52:20.260]  stopped changing. It was the same 35 millimeter film. Your good lens was a good lens. And, you
[01:52:20.260 --> 01:52:24.340]  know, and I think the digital has sort of gotten to that point too, where, where even the pros don't
[01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:29.300]  need to buy cameras as frequently because they're not getting as much bang for the buck by upgrading
[01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:35.300]  after two or three years. Yeah, you can't, you can't, I mean, the megapixel myth is a megapixel
[01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:39.860]  myth, right? There's a point at which, beyond which a better sensor, a bigger, better sensor
[01:52:39.860 --> 01:52:44.980]  doesn't buy you enough more to be worth upgrading, even if it is better. That's where Lightro was
[01:52:44.980 --> 01:52:49.940]  trying to introduce computational photography as a gimmick. There's a camera called the Light L16
[01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:54.900]  that hasn't shipped yet, that it's 16 lenses on it and will let you create like this 52 megapixel
[01:52:55.620 --> 01:53:00.980]  image with a tiny format camera using computational photography. It's a very curious approach,
[01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:05.700]  is not going to be a mass market thing, but it's very interesting. You know, so, but that's,
[01:53:05.700 --> 01:53:08.980]  I think that's the truth with everything that GoPro just stumbled. They try to expand a
[01:53:08.980 --> 01:53:12.340]  different market. It's GoPro is just the new flip. I've been saying this forever. It's what
[01:53:12.340 --> 01:53:15.700]  it feels like. But they had a great, I mean, they had a great run. I hope people made money
[01:53:15.700 --> 01:53:20.420]  because they had a great run. They had a niche product and, you know, so I don't know, I'm a
[01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:25.540]  little sad because I grew up with gadgets and I feel like I wasn't like a gadget. You know,
[01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:29.620]  maybe even I never really got into the gadget blogging side of things. I do review products
[01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:34.820]  and things like that. But, you know, he was also pointing out the Kindle, the Echo, like these
[01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:41.300]  kinds of the Echo is a gadget killer at some level because you don't see that's why I got it,
[01:53:41.300 --> 01:53:46.820]  but it's one model with a gadget from one giant company. Right. That's sort of that. And that is
[01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:52.100]  sort of the smartphone as the gadget killer is that the computers have gotten so good
[01:53:52.100 --> 01:54:00.420]  that meta gadgets are killing, you know, like a handful of really good smart computers, like
[01:54:00.420 --> 01:54:07.620]  an Echo and a Mac and an iPhone. And all of a sudden they combined obviate an entire drawer
[01:54:07.620 --> 01:54:10.420]  full of gadgets. Right. Like what else do you need? You don't need a music player. You don't
[01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:14.260]  need a camera. You don't need a snapshot GoPro style camera. You don't need a voice recorder,
[01:54:14.260 --> 01:54:19.620]  you know. Right. You get a case for your camera is now your GoPro, right? Like I've seen a lot
[01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:25.780]  of that. And, you know, I was testing some add-on lenses for iPhone 6s that'll work with a different
[01:54:25.780 --> 01:54:33.700]  case with the iPhone 7. iPhone 7 Plus is just ridiculously good too. Like the two lens, do you
[01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:40.020]  have one still? I forgot. I have my review unit here. I just took pictures in the dark outdoor
[01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:47.060]  snow. It's night. It's cloudy. I'm in Seattle. And I took pictures that I think are absolutely
[01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:54.100]  beautiful with the 1X lens. I'm like, I can't get a, you know, I'd have to, I pulled out my,
[01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:57.220]  I have a mirrorless camera with a, you know, it's like a, when I bought it, it was like a
[01:54:57.220 --> 01:55:00.900]  $1,000 system. I have a pancake lens for it. That's an affordable pancake. I went out and
[01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:04.740]  took some pictures with that. And, you know, the difference is not in that kind of lighting.
[01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:12.100]  In the mirrorless I have, I can push it to 25,600 ASA where it's super grainy. So I have to bump it
[01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:18.900]  down. The quality of the image from the iPhone 7 Plus and the $1,000 mirrorless, I'm like,
[01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:22.260]  you know, the mirrorless has other attributes that are great. But for that kind of shot,
[01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:25.860]  I'm like, I don't think it's not really. So I don't think it's the death of gadgets,
[01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:32.020]  but I think it's the death of the drawer full of gadgets. So yeah, that's a good point. It's a
[01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:36.180]  good, it is a good column. I'll put a link in the notes. His point too, is I think that like Amazon,
[01:55:36.180 --> 01:55:41.460]  Google, Apple, and a handful of other companies essentially now dominate. So the place for
[01:55:41.460 --> 01:55:47.540]  innovative startup, interesting niche things is not dead, but like at the moment it, what those
[01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:53.460]  are going to be, I think seems pretty. I think it's true too. I've long thought this about like,
[01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:59.860]  and Pebble is a perfect example where the hand, the small team, or maybe even the one person show
[01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:08.900]  can still make an enormous effect with software, but with hardware, at least electronic hardware,
[01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:16.580]  no. And I think I really think that Pebble, their first one was good enough to be their first one,
[01:56:16.580 --> 01:56:22.100]  but their improvements, their subsequent improvements were way too little, too late,
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:28.580]  at way too slow a pace. They needed much better screens and much better everything, much quicker.
[01:56:28.580 --> 01:56:32.020]  And I think, I don't even know that it was a failure. I think, you know, in terms of,
[01:56:32.020 --> 01:56:36.420]  I don't know that a team that small could have done better. Like you'd almost have to be Apple's
[01:56:36.420 --> 01:56:41.140]  or Amazon's or Google's size to do stuff like that. I think you're right. And the Pebble hit
[01:56:41.140 --> 01:56:45.300]  us point when the thing it did best, I think you said was notifications. That's what I heard from
[01:56:45.300 --> 01:56:49.700]  a lot of people, but it couldn't integrate well enough with everything. And that didn't change
[01:56:49.700 --> 01:56:54.340]  because iOS didn't change. Right. And my personal take on their notifications, the thing that killed
[01:56:54.340 --> 01:57:00.740]  it for me above and beyond the display was that I found their vibrating engine for the notifications
[01:57:00.740 --> 01:57:05.460]  to be physically unpleasant. Oh my gosh. Well, and obviously other people disagree because I
[01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:10.020]  have friends, you know, like Jason Snell and my friend Paul Kofostis who wore their Pebble watches,
[01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:13.540]  or maybe even still wear them, I don't know, but worn for a long time. But I found it to be
[01:57:13.540 --> 01:57:18.900]  unpleasant. It was way too much of a, it just, it just wasn't a very pleasing haptic feedback.
[01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:23.780]  And it was the best feature of the watch had. And so it made me dread taking advantage of the
[01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:30.580]  best fee. I didn't want any notifications because I found it to be unpleasant. So I don't know.
[01:57:30.580 --> 01:57:37.300]  Anyway, uh, I have got to go, we got to wrap it up. This just hit the two hour mark. So that's,
[01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:45.540]  that's a good show. Uh, Glenn F G L E N N two ends. You get second end for free. Glenn F on
[01:57:45.540 --> 01:57:51.700]  Twitter. Uh, where else can people find, find your work? Uh, I write a lot at Macworld some,
[01:57:51.700 --> 01:57:55.620]  some days the poor folks at Macworld some days because of all the help questions I write and
[01:57:55.620 --> 01:58:02.500]  all that. Um, you may see too much of me at now macworld.com and uh, my, uh, I think that's
[01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:06.980]  probably the best places right now to find me. I'd point out to, by the way, we didn't cover this
[01:58:06.980 --> 01:58:11.540]  very briefly. I do have a story up today. If you have an Apple cinema display with display port,
[01:58:11.540 --> 01:58:16.740]  not an Apple Thunderbolt display, looks like there may be some solutions coming. Um, one person
[01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:21.620]  found this amazing three cable solution to use with a MacBook pro. It's like, it's like an
[01:58:21.620 --> 01:58:27.620]  adapter, a cable and an inline coupler and it works that it costs like 30 bucks. But there are
[01:58:27.620 --> 01:58:31.540]  some adapters coming. I know tons of people keep asking about that. There's a column up at Macworld
[01:58:31.540 --> 01:58:36.660]  about it. And if you have one of those displays and your USB-C Thunderbolt three concern is real,
[01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:43.940]  then look for that with that. It's a show. Thank you, Glenn. Thank you so much.
