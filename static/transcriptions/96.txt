[00:00.000 --> 00:03.840]  Think you were on about two months ago. I don't know. I I'm trying to mix it up with guests
[00:03.840 --> 00:05.840]  But I really really wanted you back
[00:06.640 --> 00:08.640]  Now to talk about the watch
[00:10.040 --> 00:13.400]  Well, needless to say I have a full range of opinions about it, right
[00:14.280 --> 00:16.640]  And Renee and I last week just more or less
[00:16.840 --> 00:22.440]  Skipped it because we already filled up two hours with just the iPhone and and etc. I
[00:23.200 --> 00:27.000]  forget if I said this to Renee or if I put it in my review, but I
[00:27.000 --> 00:29.480]  I really do that. I understand
[00:29.480 --> 00:34.600]  I think I put it in my review, but I understand why Apple did it that way in terms of the event
[00:34.920 --> 00:41.400]  You know phone Apple pay and the introduction of the watch all at once, but it really
[00:42.320 --> 00:50.020]  To me gave short. What's the word shrift? What's the word short short shrift to to the iPhone 6?
[00:50.020 --> 00:57.780]  To me and I understand why they did it but boy and as a writer someone trying to get a handle on all of this
[00:58.580 --> 01:00.580]  It it was just impossible
[01:00.740 --> 01:06.820]  You know and you get you know, 30 minutes 40 minutes after the event to talk to Apple reps and there was just no way
[01:07.820 --> 01:14.060]  It always seems to go by fast and I always come up with questions good questions as soon as I'm out of you know
[01:14.060 --> 01:17.400]  And the event is over but this time it was just impossible
[01:17.400 --> 01:22.460]  It was like I did I really felt like there was no way to ask all the quick because I wanted to I wanted an
[01:22.460 --> 01:25.300]  Hour to talk about both things, you know the phone and the watch
[01:28.140 --> 01:30.620]  You think look at all the kind of bad news
[01:31.740 --> 01:36.600]  That the phone has gotten this week. And obviously it's an annual tradition that there's some sort of
[01:37.560 --> 01:39.560]  Some sort of gate, you know every year
[01:39.900 --> 01:44.580]  Apple spotlight had a great post on this thing that basically everyone comes down to people not understanding physics
[01:44.580 --> 01:46.580]  If
[01:46.940 --> 01:50.700]  You think about it the the phone never got the positive cycle in some ways
[01:50.820 --> 01:56.520]  Yeah, because it was just the the week where everyone's talking about the phone was drowned out by everyone talking about the watch
[01:56.520 --> 01:59.460]  And but it still got the negative cycle. I don't think it's gonna hurt
[01:59.460 --> 02:04.000]  I don't think it's gonna hurt it really but it's interesting that the whole cycle has been kind of
[02:04.900 --> 02:06.900]  Upset a little bit
[02:07.940 --> 02:12.700]  Yeah, I definitely think so and you know, it's you know, I guess we're coming up on
[02:12.700 --> 02:14.020]  Mmm
[02:14.020 --> 02:16.380]  three weeks since the event I
[02:17.300 --> 02:21.140]  Think so. Yeah, I feel yeah, it'll be three weeks come Tuesday
[02:21.140 --> 02:26.020]  so, you know, it just still feels like that iPhone. Yeah, it just never got the
[02:27.020 --> 02:28.780]  the positive
[02:28.780 --> 02:33.940]  Part everybody was so, you know into the pay and the watch in the first week
[02:34.980 --> 02:38.720]  Then there were just a few days, you know that that brief period between when the review
[02:38.720 --> 02:45.400]  Embargo is over and then when they have people actually get their hands on their phones, you know, Friday morning
[02:46.160 --> 02:48.160]  And then that was it, you know
[02:49.160 --> 02:51.160]  Yeah, it's interesting. I mean I
[02:52.280 --> 02:53.680]  Obviously
[02:53.680 --> 03:01.200]  Well, we should talk about it more the whole iPhone and watch being together because I thought pre event
[03:01.200 --> 03:03.200]  It made a lot of sense
[03:03.200 --> 03:08.560]  Because I went into the event looking for the watch to be more of a phone accessory
[03:08.560 --> 03:11.820]  And that was some of my criticism of the event was that it the way it was presented
[03:11.820 --> 03:14.920]  It wasn't really an accessory it needed it, but it but it wasn't
[03:15.900 --> 03:20.800]  But if that's the case, then maybe they didn't need to necessarily be presented together
[03:22.180 --> 03:29.000]  so I there's that it's actually really interesting to think about the the kind of the the optics perspective of how they
[03:29.220 --> 03:31.220]  introduced both products
[03:31.220 --> 03:39.060]  and they didn't need to be introduced together and part of why they didn't need to be is that the watch does work with I
[03:39.060 --> 03:45.500]  Think all the way back to the 4s or at least to the iPhone 5 maybe it's just iPhone 5 but you know
[03:45.500 --> 03:49.060]  At least two two years of existing iPhones, you know
[03:49.060 --> 03:53.660]  I think Tim Cook said there's at least a hundred million people out there that already
[03:54.100 --> 03:58.740]  Even before the iPhone 6 hit already owned an iPhone that's compatible with the watch
[03:58.740 --> 04:00.740]  So
[04:01.780 --> 04:04.780]  They didn't need to like I think maybe if you know
[04:04.780 --> 04:10.020]  There's a story that came out this week that from the information that you know
[04:10.020 --> 04:13.860]  That Apple had been hoping to actually have the watch on sale this year
[04:15.100 --> 04:19.940]  Rather than just announcing it and hoping that it comes out early next year what they said
[04:19.940 --> 04:22.380]  They'd be lucky if it came out by Valentine's Day
[04:24.140 --> 04:26.980]  Which is interesting but not surprising to me
[04:26.980 --> 04:30.740]  I mean, of course, they would rather have it come out sooner rather than later, you know
[04:30.740 --> 04:36.980]  And like everything in all of us do most things end up taking longer than we had hoped
[04:38.060 --> 04:39.820]  Yeah, we should this is where we note that
[04:39.820 --> 04:44.500]  Well, we're running an hour late which which is fine because I'm a writer too is so I can appreciate you
[04:44.500 --> 04:45.740]  You just need to wrap it up
[04:45.740 --> 04:51.580]  But then I realized it's about Derek Jeter and I was much more conflicted in my in my emotions. Oh
[04:52.900 --> 04:55.700]  That that was the holdup waiting to start the podcast
[04:55.700 --> 04:58.460]  Yes, which is fine. Actually, I I appreciate
[04:59.100 --> 05:02.100]  Jeter and all that went down until you wrote in the article that uh
[05:02.260 --> 05:06.940]  It's been so long since the Yankees won and meanwhile, I'm sitting here as a Milwaukee Brewers fan
[05:06.940 --> 05:12.500]  We've never won anything and the just silent silent resenting you. Yeah, they really crapped out this year, too
[05:12.500 --> 05:16.980]  Oh, it's so brutal weren't they they were like 20 games over 500 at one point
[05:16.980 --> 05:17.940]  I don't know
[05:17.940 --> 05:22.780]  I don't know if was that many but they I mean they had like a 10 game leader division or something. Yeah
[05:22.780 --> 05:27.620]  It's it's it's it's it's the Brewers. Yeah, let's not talk about
[05:31.300 --> 05:35.140]  But I do think it helped though and that's why you know, I even said last week with Renee
[05:35.140 --> 05:41.100]  It's why a month prior in August that I sort of hinted that I thought the watch would be announced
[05:41.620 --> 05:47.380]  In the September event is that it's combined with the fact that they do kind of go along with each other
[05:47.380 --> 05:53.860]  And if they were gonna talk about like health kit and you know the m8
[05:55.260 --> 06:02.060]  Thing on the phone and fitness tracking they certainly are companions, you know siblings in that regard
[06:02.740 --> 06:05.620]  You know that the the information that's gonna fill up
[06:06.020 --> 06:12.180]  The health app is you know gonna come from those two sources gonna come from the phones gonna come from the watch if you buy
[06:12.180 --> 06:13.920]  the watch
[06:13.920 --> 06:18.200]  But it's also to me about how you set up the next event
[06:18.980 --> 06:24.940]  Which I expected, you know sometime in October, you know as as per the previous three years
[06:25.460 --> 06:28.860]  where they'll do new I pop pads and
[06:29.540 --> 06:33.020]  Give Yosemite a proper, you know public unveiling
[06:34.620 --> 06:40.460]  Right and it would have definitely made even less less sense there I said, right you've noted I guess
[06:41.820 --> 06:43.380]  what's
[06:43.380 --> 06:46.700]  The more the thing is is like I mean, so I've had an evolved
[06:47.380 --> 06:53.600]  Position on the on the watch. I was initially quite critical thought I should much more focused and limited now
[06:53.600 --> 06:58.820]  I think it's much more ambitious than I at first realized and not only that
[06:58.820 --> 07:02.820]  I think that's probably the right move to establish the category which I'm sure we can get into in a little bit
[07:03.060 --> 07:08.660]  But but the fact that it was introduced with the phone only reinforced
[07:08.660 --> 07:12.940]  The the sense that it's that it's a companion for the phone
[07:13.100 --> 07:19.660]  But the event itself presented it that it wasn't and so like there ended up being actually I think more kind of dissonance
[07:20.020 --> 07:23.020]  Then then had it been at a separate event
[07:23.020 --> 07:25.340]  He even maybe would have been awkward at another time
[07:25.340 --> 07:32.080]  But here was just it was just kind of strange and I think it almost it muddied the message that I think they were sending
[07:32.980 --> 07:35.300]  Yeah, I think so, too, and I'm not sure
[07:35.300 --> 07:40.540]  whether that's a mistake or not, I feel like we have to wait and see how this plays out and
[07:40.900 --> 07:42.900]  It may not hurt them at all
[07:43.380 --> 07:48.140]  but I do think it was the as the time goes by and I
[07:48.900 --> 07:54.740]  Want to talk about this because I think it's been an interesting three weeks where no new information has actually come out, right?
[07:54.740 --> 08:00.060]  I mean all we don't have any more information than what Apple told us and published on apple.com on
[08:00.060 --> 08:04.540]  on Tuesday, September 9th, but I feel like a lot of us have
[08:07.260 --> 08:09.260]  Our understanding and
[08:09.860 --> 08:17.500]  Expectations for the watch have changed significantly, you know yours publicly, you know from what you wrote initially to what you've published this week
[08:18.420 --> 08:23.420]  And mine too, even you know, even since from what I wrote a week after the event
[08:23.420 --> 08:29.220]  You know and I was listening to I know there's another one that just came out today before
[08:29.220 --> 08:33.100]  I didn't get to listen to but I was listening to the last week's episode of
[08:33.900 --> 08:36.700]  ATP and I thought that if you know
[08:36.700 --> 08:42.060]  I'd assume that most people who listen to this show or there's a large overlap between the audiences
[08:42.060 --> 08:46.380]  But if you you know are only an occasional ATP listener episode 83
[08:46.820 --> 08:51.260]  Was a really good one for the watch because it was to me
[08:51.260 --> 08:53.940]  It was ATP at its best where the the three of them
[08:54.940 --> 08:57.780]  Were not in agreement and then in a lot of ways
[08:57.980 --> 09:02.820]  No, no two of them were in agreement on a lot of the issues surrounding the watch, right?
[09:03.980 --> 09:07.100]  which I you know made for a great discussion and they they
[09:08.060 --> 09:13.220]  worked their way into and out of a whole bunch of the problems surrounding the watch and
[09:13.820 --> 09:15.820]  And their understanding of it
[09:16.180 --> 09:18.340]  So that was a good one. And there's a couple of points
[09:18.340 --> 09:21.260]  I thought of listening to it just that I want to talk to you about
[09:22.060 --> 09:24.060]  No, I agree. It was a great one. Um
[09:25.140 --> 09:30.780]  Especially totally inside baseball when when Casey took on Marco was was the highlight
[09:30.780 --> 09:35.580]  Yeah, that was the irony of it was that I've dubbed the three the one who I agreed with the most was Casey
[09:35.580 --> 09:41.340]  I think Casey Casey got it in a way that I'd feel like the other two didn't
[09:41.340 --> 09:48.220]  Yeah, no, I I agree. Um, I mean we're basically Marco was was saying how could you make an expensive item and Casey pointed out?
[09:48.220 --> 09:50.660]  That Marco drives, you know a custom imported m5
[09:52.140 --> 09:54.540]  Which which I think is is spot-on
[09:54.540 --> 10:00.780]  I mean we we go I know both you and I have gone back to the car analogy on multiple occasions
[10:01.140 --> 10:06.940]  Just because it's it's it's such a great one. Like it makes it makes so much sense. Like there is no
[10:06.940 --> 10:12.540]  Quote-unquote reason for a BMW to exist. There's no reason to drive an m5 on u.s. Highways
[10:13.660 --> 10:20.820]  But people do it and they do it because it's it's giving them benefits beyond like the technology underneath it
[10:20.820 --> 10:25.500]  It's it's it's it's about it's more about utility. It's funny. Like I just mentioned the Jeter thing
[10:25.500 --> 10:28.500]  I would imagine this is your argument for why?
[10:29.140 --> 10:32.460]  People like Keith Olbermann are wrong to criticize Jeter just on stats
[10:32.460 --> 10:37.860]  I would I might let me put words in your mouth. Like there's a contention that there's more going on here than just
[10:38.380 --> 10:43.460]  What you can count with numbers and it's absolutely the same sort of thing with any product
[10:43.460 --> 10:47.740]  But particularly with something that you're that you're wearing that you're displaying to the world
[10:47.740 --> 10:52.820]  There's so much more that goes into it than the actual technical utility of what it does or what it does not do
[10:53.580 --> 10:57.780]  This is such a classic talk show because it keeps coming back to Jeter any Yankees
[10:57.780 --> 11:00.940]  But I do so I don't want to judge we have so much to do
[11:00.940 --> 11:05.580]  So I don't want to judge we have so much to watch them to talk about and I know that there's a bunch of you
[11:05.580 --> 11:09.980]  Out there who listen to who and the sports stuff comes up you guys start like looking for fast-forward button
[11:09.980 --> 11:16.780]  So I'm not gonna go sporty sports on it. But the gist of it is so Keith Olbermann. Is it I like him?
[11:16.780 --> 11:18.060]  I'm a huge fan of his work
[11:18.060 --> 11:19.180]  He's but he's you know
[11:19.180 --> 11:25.380]  Not really a straight news guy and maybe never really was but he's more of like the the TV equivalent of a sports columnist
[11:25.380 --> 11:31.160]  He's an opinion guy and he had a rant on his show on ESPN last week
[11:32.860 --> 11:35.780]  More or less saying no Derek Jeter is you know, maybe a fine guy
[11:35.780 --> 11:40.060]  But he's not one of the greatest players who's ever played the game and everybody keeps going on and on about how
[11:40.300 --> 11:47.480]  one of the all-time greats is retiring and that is not and I you know not to put words in his mouth but his
[11:47.620 --> 11:53.140]  Argument came down to look his stats. Just his stats are very very good, but they are not all-time great and
[11:53.140 --> 11:55.420]  I to me it's exactly
[11:56.420 --> 12:02.380]  Like the people like the Android people who everything is about specs, you know
[12:02.380 --> 12:07.820]  And it's had the a8 isn't that great because geez, it's still only dual core
[12:08.180 --> 12:14.100]  We've been you know, every every top flight Android phone has been quad core since whenever you know
[12:14.100 --> 12:19.500]  they're up at 2 gigahertz and Apple's still down clocking them to one point whatever gigahertz and
[12:19.500 --> 12:22.540]  You know only 1 gigabyte of RAM
[12:22.540 --> 12:27.340]  They've been on you know and on and on spec wise and it's like if that's if you want to judge the iPhone
[12:27.660 --> 12:34.620]  Compared to the HTC one or Samsung's galaxy node or the galaxy alpha whatever it came out today
[12:35.980 --> 12:37.900]  based on a
[12:37.900 --> 12:39.900]  that classic tech
[12:39.900 --> 12:48.620]  Review checklist style, you know, how fast is the CPU how much RAM? What is the benchmark on this or that?
[12:50.620 --> 12:52.280]  You know, you're never gonna get it
[12:52.280 --> 12:59.340]  You're not gonna get the difference between what Apple's trying to do and I think has largely succeeded year after year after you're doing
[12:59.740 --> 13:03.020]  You're not gonna get it, you know, and I you know, if that's the way your mind works
[13:03.020 --> 13:05.860]  That's why you're an Android guy, you know, and you're happy for it
[13:05.860 --> 13:09.940]  You know, I'm glad that you know Android is is as successful that it is for you
[13:09.940 --> 13:13.540]  But you you know, you're you're trying to judge the iPhone on the wrong thing and that's exactly
[13:14.340 --> 13:16.580]  Looking at Jeter that way. It's exactly the same way
[13:18.060 --> 13:22.200]  No, I agree and if I'm gonna continue the Jeter thing just for a moment
[13:22.200 --> 13:22.340]  I mean
[13:22.340 --> 13:29.300]  I think I I've I've come around on it and for the same reason and like the defense is like one thing right Jeter's widely
[13:29.300 --> 13:31.300]  criticized for his defense and according to the stats
[13:31.300 --> 13:36.700]  Rightly, so he's he's not like he always makes the routine play never makes mistakes
[13:36.700 --> 13:40.100]  But he doesn't have great range doesn't get to as many balls as he can
[13:41.420 --> 13:45.040]  Yet the most iconic Jeter play is a defensive play
[13:45.700 --> 13:53.300]  Where in the playoffs, you know best of five series the Yankees were losing 2-0 and he makes this like totally just kind of random
[13:53.300 --> 13:57.580]  Play to catch a misthrone ball and flip it to home plate and get the guy out
[13:57.700 --> 14:00.560]  Basically saving the game and saving this saving the season
[14:00.560 --> 14:02.760]  and and what
[14:03.280 --> 14:08.800]  What I like about that and yes, it's it's very cliche and it's almost too neat in some ways
[14:09.440 --> 14:11.920]  But that's Jeter's career in a nutshell I guess
[14:12.560 --> 14:14.160]  is
[14:14.160 --> 14:19.840]  In the grand scheme of things like the the defensive measures like run saved or over average or something like that
[14:19.840 --> 14:21.440]  I don't know exactly what the wording is
[14:21.440 --> 14:26.960]  But yeah, that one run was worth like a thousand runs saved in the in the regular season
[14:26.960 --> 14:31.480]  Right, and it was it was a playoff game against the Oakland A's in
[14:32.520 --> 14:38.140]  Geez, 2003. I found 2001 2001. Oh, yeah. Yeah 2001. Yeah, and the Yankees ended up
[14:38.140 --> 14:41.840]  They didn't win the World Series that year actually, but rice it was in that emotional
[14:43.200 --> 14:49.840]  The everything was pushed back a week because of 9-11 having occurred and you know that year in New York
[14:49.840 --> 14:57.480]  It was in Oakland, which is a crazy ballpark and they were down to zero and is the best of five series
[14:57.480 --> 15:01.680]  so if they lost that game they were they were done right and it's just
[15:03.080 --> 15:09.600]  Errant throw to home, you know and it missed the cutoff guy who was supposed to be the first baseman and it Jeter had no
[15:09.600 --> 15:14.600]  Reason to be there. There's no reason for a shortstop to ever be where Jeter was but he was there. He saw it
[15:14.600 --> 15:16.160]  He saw the play
[15:16.160 --> 15:21.520]  You know, yeah, it's a great example. It's an absolute great exam or look at the other two to me
[15:21.520 --> 15:27.720]  Two of the other signature plays in Jeter's career the two times that he went flying into the stands to catch foul balls
[15:28.460 --> 15:33.200]  You know, there was you know, the one time it's like his face got so busted out
[15:33.200 --> 15:36.000]  He actually had to come out of the game. His face was all you know bloody
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.040]  He looked like he'd been in a boxing match, but he made the catch, you know, I
[15:39.640 --> 15:45.200]  Don't know just he's made catches like that. You know, there's there's footage of him, you know, you can watch it
[15:45.200 --> 15:52.200]  You can you know, look it up on YouTube and see him make big game playoff catches flying headfirst into the stands
[15:53.680 --> 15:58.160]  You know, he's done it more than once most guys finished the whole career and never make a play like that
[15:58.280 --> 16:00.480]  So I totally agree. You can't measure it by stats
[16:01.000 --> 16:06.400]  This whole thing is a thing in sports in general, right? Because there's been a big statistical revolution in in sports
[16:07.560 --> 16:12.800]  Breaking things down particularly in baseball where it's actually works the best because baseball really is a one-on-one game
[16:12.800 --> 16:16.080]  it's not really a team game in some ways and
[16:17.480 --> 16:21.980]  Between the pitcher pitcher and batter and I in many respects. It's been good
[16:21.980 --> 16:29.080]  It's been good for teams teams that have adopted this approach have excelled but like any sort of
[16:30.440 --> 16:32.440]  analytical based
[16:32.720 --> 16:37.200]  Thing it gives you an advantage briefly, but it's it's cut. It's easily copied
[16:37.200 --> 16:44.040]  so now almost everyone does it and so the advantages are less much less than they were previously and
[16:44.480 --> 16:50.480]  What ends up mattering then and you see this in I think probably more basketball that which is the sport
[16:50.480 --> 16:53.040]  I follow more closely that then in baseball is
[16:54.040 --> 17:00.520]  the importance of lots of the intangible stuff like how a team works together like how how
[17:00.960 --> 17:05.560]  Shuff shifts back and forth. So you had a team, you know last year like the Spurs winning the title
[17:05.560 --> 17:11.640]  despite not being the strongest team on paper and it's because there's clearly like something else going on and
[17:12.520 --> 17:15.040]  and I think that's so much of that applies to
[17:16.280 --> 17:21.060]  If you think about technology in general previously in the 80s in the 90s
[17:21.920 --> 17:26.880]  businesses were buying it and the idea is someone the person who buying it was different than the person who's using it and
[17:27.360 --> 17:29.080]  that sort of
[17:29.080 --> 17:33.460]  scenario lends itself to feature lists lends itself to price competition because
[17:33.460 --> 17:37.140]  The user experience is completely divorced from the buying experience
[17:37.180 --> 17:37.700]  Yeah
[17:37.700 --> 17:41.460]  But now when it's more in the consumer space all these intangible
[17:41.580 --> 17:47.140]  Things like what it's like to use it how you feel when someone sees you pull out of your pocket like all these
[17:47.620 --> 17:55.740]  little bits and pieces that you can't really measure become much more important and as that's happened Apple has benefited and
[17:55.940 --> 18:00.900]  As devices have become more personal as devices have become with us more often
[18:00.900 --> 18:06.620]  Apple has benefited and even something like a watch that's very visible and is with you all of the time
[18:06.620 --> 18:13.780]  I mean Apple I would imagine is is salivating at the opportunity because it fits so well with their strengths. Yeah, I
[18:15.420 --> 18:16.500]  Completely agree with that
[18:16.500 --> 18:21.360]  I would say if you look at Apple zoom out to the big picture and just look at them from the founding in
[18:22.260 --> 18:28.520]  1976 to today the miracle is that they survived until now right, you know
[18:28.520 --> 18:35.740]  And and now meaning let's say the iPhone in 2007 or even the iPod let's you know, cuz that's it's that's the thing that turned
[18:35.740 --> 18:37.140]  them around
[18:37.140 --> 18:40.500]  That they made it until 2001 when they could
[18:41.720 --> 18:47.680]  Launch the iPod and and start to make you know to really grow outside the tech world
[18:48.380 --> 18:49.420]  I
[18:49.420 --> 18:54.580]  Have a friend a good friend Matt who's a fellow Yankees fan. I think he listens to the show
[18:54.580 --> 18:58.100]  He's probably gonna be thrilled. I'm talking about him, but he when I first met him
[18:58.100 --> 18:59.940]  he
[18:59.940 --> 19:04.320]  He asked me when he you know, he knew I was a Yankees fan from reading, you know during fireball
[19:05.300 --> 19:10.820]  But his theory is that there's two types of sports fans stats stats fans and story fans
[19:12.380 --> 19:13.580]  And
[19:13.580 --> 19:17.180]  You know, it's it's any anytime you try to say there's only two type of people
[19:17.180 --> 19:17.460]  Of course
[19:17.460 --> 19:23.060]  There's a gray zone and you know some stats guys are a little bit into the story side and some story guys are still
[19:23.060 --> 19:28.340]  Interested in some of the stats. I'm a story guy though in his telling where it's I
[19:28.740 --> 19:34.000]  Just don't get into the numbers that much, you know, and it's I I believe in clutch hitting
[19:34.000 --> 19:40.500]  I believe in clutch performance and I know that's one of the stats guys things, you know, like, you know, the the baseball prospectus
[19:41.020 --> 19:46.820]  Guys Bill James, you know, there's a theory that they try to back up that there's no such thing as clutch hitting
[19:46.860 --> 19:51.280]  Yeah, you know and I I say you say there's no such thing as clutch hitting and I say
[19:51.280 --> 19:55.220]  Derek Jeter and I just don't see how you could deny it
[19:56.040 --> 19:58.160]  Don't meet his spotlight, right?
[19:58.840 --> 20:01.000]  And even though to back it up and one of them, you know
[20:01.360 --> 20:06.160]  The whole Jeter farewell thing is just chock full of all these statistics and stuff like that
[20:06.940 --> 20:12.460]  but one of the most amazing ones is and I this is off the top man, I'm not gonna look it up, but it's
[20:13.900 --> 20:15.900]  He's played 158
[20:16.280 --> 20:17.880]  postseason games
[20:17.880 --> 20:23.900]  Which is you know in the regular baseball seasons 162 games and most guys would be lucky to play 158
[20:24.160 --> 20:30.680]  You know even players who aren't injured take a game off here and there so he's played easily the equivalent of a full
[20:31.160 --> 20:33.120]  regular season all
[20:33.120 --> 20:38.560]  postseason which by definition is only against the very best pitchers and
[20:39.120 --> 20:44.000]  Opposing teams don't you know every postseason game is against a team that was good enough to make it in the postseason
[20:44.000 --> 20:51.520]  And he's got like a 320 career postseason batting average, you know enough that it would win a batting title most years
[20:51.520 --> 20:53.720]  And that's ill, you know in the postseason
[20:54.640 --> 20:56.640]  no, that that's really impressive because
[20:57.500 --> 20:59.860]  Batting averages dropped significantly in the postseason
[21:00.720 --> 21:07.120]  Right because the pitching is so much better so much better. It's you know, it's it's really that that's that's the way to win
[21:07.120 --> 21:11.660]  You know postseason baseball games is to have amazing pitching. You know, it was like with the
[21:11.660 --> 21:13.660]  remember the White Sox
[21:14.380 --> 21:16.380]  when they won in
[21:16.540 --> 21:21.540]  2000 I get the year wrong six when did the year whatever year it was at the or
[21:22.020 --> 21:27.260]  Whatever year the Chicago White Sox won a decade ago. They won the World Series in four games
[21:27.260 --> 21:29.260]  There are four pitchers pitched four complete games
[21:29.540 --> 21:36.680]  It was it's like unbelievable like they had four pitchers who caught fire and were just unhittable and they just went one two
[21:36.680 --> 21:38.680]  Three four the World Series is over
[21:38.680 --> 21:41.760]  Yeah, it's like having a hot goalie in in hockey or something
[21:41.760 --> 21:48.840]  You can just shut out everything else and tech is exactly the same that there's story guys and stats guys
[21:48.840 --> 21:50.840]  and you know and the
[21:51.320 --> 21:55.740]  Tech industry was so dominated by the stats the specs
[21:56.400 --> 21:58.400]  for so long
[21:59.140 --> 22:06.360]  Because it was only tech people effectively, you know, everybody using a computer was a tech person you for some reason
[22:06.360 --> 22:12.840]  You know that that's that was the the problem Apple faced in 1984 with the Macintosh is they'd build a computer
[22:12.960 --> 22:16.140]  You know quote-unquote for the rest of us and there were times of us
[22:16.180 --> 22:22.040]  Well there they had no interest in a computer, you know, it really kind of needed the computing world needed
[22:22.920 --> 22:29.620]  The internet and to make it a communications device because that's something everybody wants to do everybody
[22:29.620 --> 22:31.620]  You know, it's it's being able to communicate that
[22:31.620 --> 22:35.660]  That turned the computer into something regular people wanted
[22:36.780 --> 22:42.500]  And by that time it was you know, it was too late Windows had become entrenched and you know
[22:42.500 --> 22:46.660]  When everybody got on the internet, it was a Windows dominated world. Yeah
[22:46.660 --> 22:51.440]  No, I think this is the key thing that every time you hear someone talk about Mac versus Windows
[22:52.580 --> 22:56.420]  it actually had very little to do with the the
[22:56.420 --> 23:03.420]  Underlined dynamics it had to do with the external context and who was buying and all that all that sort of stuff and anyone who?
[23:03.420 --> 23:05.340]  Doesn't really talk about that
[23:05.340 --> 23:09.540]  You can take in my opinion, you know their opinion with a very large grain of salt
[23:10.300 --> 23:14.900]  because that the world was just so completely and utterly different then and
[23:15.740 --> 23:18.920]  There's actually very few lessons to be drawn to today. Yeah
[23:20.340 --> 23:26.340]  The famous I brought this up and it's it's you know, maybe one of the all-time claim chowders of all time
[23:26.340 --> 23:32.560]  Is commander tacos reaction to the original iPod back in 2001 on slashdot?
[23:35.060 --> 23:42.620]  Here's his whole comment after Apple released the iPod no wireless less space than a nomad lame
[23:44.420 --> 23:45.900]  So it was all you know
[23:45.900 --> 23:51.880]  It was completely looking at it from the perspective and we laugh at that in hindsight right that the original iPod was lame
[23:51.880 --> 23:57.960]  But it it was a rational perspective from the point of view of the type of people who read slashtop
[23:57.960 --> 24:03.840]  Oh for sure. I'm surprised. The only thing he forgot to put in was was way too expensive. Yeah
[24:04.360 --> 24:07.000]  Yeah, exactly. Where maybe you know, it's
[24:09.160 --> 24:13.640]  Yeah to hit the trifecta, you know does less doesn't have wireless
[24:13.640 --> 24:18.480]  We want in everything to be wireless for whatever reason less space than a nomad remember nomads
[24:18.480 --> 24:25.000]  I mean who we've made that create every no creative labs. Yeah, I had a diamond diamond was the other one
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  I had a diamond Rio
[24:27.560 --> 24:31.160]  But yeah creative labs. There's the guys who sued Apple about the
[24:32.280 --> 24:34.280]  About the sound chip in the iPod actually won
[24:34.280 --> 24:40.760]  I think that that that single Hanley kept their company afloat for I think they might still be around actually. I'm not sure
[24:41.640 --> 24:43.800]  But yeah creative technologies out of Singapore
[24:43.800 --> 24:49.880]  Right, whereas the you know, there was some amazing technology in that original iPod
[24:50.920 --> 24:56.680]  Like the the 1.8 inch hard drive. I think that's the size that it was was a new thing
[24:56.680 --> 25:02.080]  It was like nobody had used it and there's some great stories. I forget who published it originally, but it was
[25:03.480 --> 25:05.480]  What was the name that guy he was the
[25:06.760 --> 25:08.760]  He ended up at palm. Yeah
[25:08.760 --> 25:15.880]  He ended up at palm yeah, um Rubinstein Rubinstein right John Rubinstein was
[25:16.920 --> 25:19.000]  engineering head at Apple at the time and
[25:20.280 --> 25:23.280]  was over in Asia like scouting
[25:23.280 --> 25:30.160]  You know new stuff and I think it was Toshiba who'd come up with these and they were like, oh and we've got we've done this
[25:30.160 --> 25:36.720]  we've gone from 2.5 inch hard drives to 1.8 inch and nobody wants to buy them because
[25:36.720 --> 25:42.760]  Everybody's putting hard drives the smallest thing. Anybody was putting hard drives into were laptops and laptops
[25:44.360 --> 25:47.960]  In 2001 or 2000 whatever year it was
[25:49.040 --> 25:56.040]  even the small ones the difference between a 1.8 and a 2.5 inch hard drive didn't make a difference and so why spend it why
[25:56.040 --> 26:00.920]  You know everybody told Toshiba. Well, why would we spend all this money when we don't really need to save that space?
[26:00.920 --> 26:06.520]  Whereas Rubinstein looked at them and thought that's it. That's the thing we can, you know
[26:06.520 --> 26:13.600]  Do this music thing with to you know, because 2.5 was way too big. Well, what's so interesting about this whole story actually is
[26:15.240 --> 26:17.240]  It's very it's a very
[26:17.800 --> 26:22.360]  Un-apple kind of story which in some ways the iPod is a bit of an un-apple type product
[26:22.800 --> 26:29.480]  But basically in Jan so the app what a vision originally said like oh, we're gonna be like about personal video
[26:29.480 --> 26:33.720]  That's gonna be the new, you know, desktop publishing and then they're like, oh crap
[26:33.720 --> 26:38.200]  We missed the music boat and then Steve Jobs came out said actually our we have a new strategy
[26:38.200 --> 26:40.360]  It's called the digital hub strategy, right?
[26:40.360 --> 26:46.400]  And the center and we're gonna and then the rest of the event where the event where he introduced the digital hub strategy
[26:46.400 --> 26:51.200]  was in January 2001 in the same event they introduced iTunes and
[26:52.800 --> 26:55.320]  And they talked and they spent the whole time talking about music
[26:55.320 --> 27:01.800]  It was rip mix burn was the was kind of the catchphrase and the thing is the iPod didn't exist at all
[27:01.800 --> 27:07.160]  It didn't exist at Apple because John Rubinstein didn't go to Japan until February the next month
[27:07.480 --> 27:09.320]  Right and it was when he was in Japan
[27:09.320 --> 27:13.480]  He was introduced to or he saw the hard drive and it was the hard drive
[27:13.480 --> 27:16.160]  That was the genesis for the iPod
[27:16.160 --> 27:21.600]  And so it's actually it's almost like completely backwards from the way we think about an Apple product being created
[27:21.600 --> 27:24.040]  And so the original iPod is put together in like six months
[27:24.040 --> 27:27.280]  And and this was put together super fast
[27:27.280 --> 27:32.360]  It was totally driven by the technology, but what came out wasn't a technological product
[27:32.360 --> 27:36.480]  it was a you know, it was a it was a music player and there's something like
[27:37.080 --> 27:39.520]  it's very different to to be a
[27:40.080 --> 27:41.560]  to be a
[27:41.560 --> 27:48.400]  hard drive than is to be a music player and it's that kind of transformation from a technological item to a
[27:48.400 --> 27:52.880]  a something that you desire because it makes your life better that
[27:53.520 --> 27:57.400]  That Apple's that is Apple that whether is what Apple is so good at
[27:57.920 --> 27:59.160]  Yeah
[27:59.160 --> 28:02.360]  And you know, we'll just get back to the watch after I'll take a break in a moment
[28:02.360 --> 28:04.440]  We'll get back to the watch, but I do think you're right though
[28:04.440 --> 28:06.440]  And I think you even mentioned this on
[28:06.560 --> 28:11.840]  Stratecary this week or was it you who mentioned that the iPod was sort of an on-apple like product in hindsight
[28:11.840 --> 28:15.640]  I think I've mentioned it. Yeah, I think I've yeah I did in the article about the watch
[28:15.640 --> 28:20.760]  And it's worth keeping that in mind. I think thinking about what the watch is
[28:21.840 --> 28:24.320]  A going to be or what their intentions are
[28:24.320 --> 28:29.520]  Is it an iPod on your wrist or is it something more and I'm with you that I think it's something more
[28:30.200 --> 28:35.680]  Yeah, I mean I've I've gotten tripped up by the iPod a few times in my analysis like last year
[28:35.680 --> 28:41.600]  I originally said the phone would be much much cheaper than it was because I was thinking about the iPod and how the iPod was
[28:41.600 --> 28:43.240]  always price competitive
[28:43.240 --> 28:46.980]  And I you know, I did within a week. I think I think you chatted me at the time
[28:47.560 --> 28:50.680]  I said no, actually, I think it's gonna be pretty expensive and ended up being that
[28:51.280 --> 28:55.800]  Basically, the iPod was it was always a basically an accessory
[28:55.800 --> 29:00.600]  It was a single-purpose device a peripheral a print. Yes, exactly. That's the word
[29:00.600 --> 29:07.200]  It was a peripheral that was very cost-competitive. It was it was done in an Apple way. It was simple
[29:07.280 --> 29:10.560]  It was very well thought out that beautiful industrial design
[29:10.560 --> 29:15.440]  But if you think about it, every other Apple product of note has been a platform
[29:15.800 --> 29:22.800]  It's been a general-purpose computer and the the arc of Apple is to create a general-purpose computer
[29:22.800 --> 29:27.440]  that's smaller and more attractive and more accessible than the competition and
[29:28.160 --> 29:30.400]  everything fits in that arc except for
[29:31.080 --> 29:33.040]  Except for the iPod. It's yeah
[29:33.040 --> 29:40.920]  I don't think it makes any more sense than as it as a typical Apple product doesn't make any more sense than if in some
[29:40.920 --> 29:43.220]  alternate universe the QuickTake camera
[29:43.840 --> 29:49.860]  Had really taken off and that Apple had become a major player in digital photography
[29:50.040 --> 29:53.320]  Yeah, which of course they are now that the phone is out, but you know what I mean?
[29:53.320 --> 29:54.840]  I mean the QuickTake was amazing
[29:54.840 --> 29:59.760]  I forget what year that came out in the 90s, but it was amazing and it was one of the it was super expensive
[29:59.760 --> 30:04.400]  Compared to like film cameras, but it was one of the first digital cameras
[30:04.400 --> 30:09.200]  That was at least plausible for someone to own and it was amazing and it took you know
[30:09.200 --> 30:11.720]  it took like 320 by 320 pictures or something, but
[30:12.480 --> 30:16.080]  But in some world in some alternate universe that could have become a hit
[30:16.960 --> 30:19.600]  especially I think if it did, you know if
[30:20.320 --> 30:24.440]  Jobs and his crew had gotten there a little earlier and cleaned up, you know
[30:24.440 --> 30:31.560]  The the product development and like they eventually did if it had been a little bit more of a jobsy
[30:32.200 --> 30:34.200]  Apple product than
[30:34.480 --> 30:40.600]  Scully era Apple product it might have been but it would have been weird for Apple to be selling something like a camera
[30:40.600 --> 30:44.480]  But no more weird than it was that they played that they were selling a Walkman. No, totally
[30:44.480 --> 30:48.440]  You know, I actually think the the camera is a great example. Um, I
[30:49.200 --> 30:53.120]  Think the other example that's interesting in telling is the laser writer actually
[30:53.120 --> 30:54.400]  um
[30:54.400 --> 30:55.520]  where
[30:55.520 --> 30:59.800]  Apple actually was like one of the preeminent printer manufacturers in the world
[31:00.920 --> 31:04.240]  But that was that they were never a printer company
[31:04.240 --> 31:09.720]  Like that was that was to enable the Mac to like enable desktop publishing and all that and all that sort of stuff
[31:10.520 --> 31:12.840]  but I think both are both are examples of
[31:13.600 --> 31:16.640]  in one a hit when we're not so much but of
[31:16.640 --> 31:22.480]  Products Apple made but by no means to find the company. Nobody's yeah, well as a printer
[31:23.200 --> 31:29.960]  And it all comes back to the the story slash stats divide in the tech world where my you know
[31:29.960 --> 31:34.880]  and again, this is super ancient history the laser writer stuff, but my you know, my understanding of that is
[31:35.480 --> 31:38.920]  Apple wanted others. They didn't even want to get in the printer business, really
[31:38.920 --> 31:42.000]  I mean they'd you know, they take the money and they sold them for a lot of money
[31:42.000 --> 31:44.400]  But you know and they never you know when they eventually got out
[31:44.400 --> 31:48.840]  There was nobody nobody was pouring one out for the Apple printers, you know
[31:48.840 --> 31:51.240]  It was never really the company's heart was never in it
[31:51.240 --> 31:53.880]  But the gist of it was they couldn't get other companies to make them
[31:53.880 --> 31:58.800]  They were like hey you guys could build these laser printers. And yes, they'll be crazy expensive
[31:59.520 --> 32:05.360]  But look at the output we can do beautiful high resolution output and everybody, you know
[32:05.360 --> 32:08.360]  The industry was like a dot matrix is good enough, you know
[32:09.320 --> 32:13.880]  We don't need that, you know, and whereas the output was horrible from dot matrix printers
[32:13.880 --> 32:15.280]  Yeah
[32:15.280 --> 32:17.280]  It's absolutely horrible
[32:17.440 --> 32:21.480]  Yeah, it's crazy. It's crazy to even think of that to compare them. But I mean it's
[32:22.040 --> 32:28.480]  What's interesting though is yeah, the I mean the laser writer wasn't I'm looking at Wikipedia article was released the same day as page maker
[32:29.360 --> 32:34.600]  And it was way more expensive than what was on the market, but it had Apple talk
[32:34.600 --> 32:39.280]  Which said it'd be used by multiple people. So the per user cost was lower like
[32:39.280 --> 32:45.840]  It's funny. You see almost all these characteristics of of a typical Apple product wrapped up in a printer
[32:45.840 --> 32:48.600]  which is kind of weird to think about but I think the broad takeaway is
[32:49.680 --> 32:57.500]  Nobody thinks of Apple as a printer company and I'm definitely not gonna reference the Wazer writer when I think about analysis of the watch
[32:58.800 --> 33:03.060]  But on the same tone, I think I'm not sure you should be referencing the iPod when you think about
[33:03.060 --> 33:08.700]  Analysis either. All right, let's take a break. I'm gonna thank our first sponsor brand new sponsor
[33:10.180 --> 33:14.180]  Really excited to have it. It's a cool app for the Mac called you bar
[33:14.740 --> 33:21.960]  That's like it the lowercase letter U capital B for bar you be a are you bar?
[33:23.420 --> 33:29.260]  It's a dock replacement for the Mac a dock alternative if you will because you can't really replace the dock
[33:29.260 --> 33:32.540]  But you can configure it in a whole bunch of ways
[33:32.540 --> 33:36.340]  It's like a power users dock so you can configure it like a dock
[33:36.340 --> 33:43.000]  It's like the Apple dock but better or you can use it a lot some in something that's more like a taskbar like from Windows
[33:44.100 --> 33:49.900]  So if you're a Windows convert and the taskbar from Windows is one of the things you really liked on Windows and you miss it
[33:49.900 --> 33:53.580]  You bar is definitely the thing to look at and even if you're a Mac user
[33:53.580 --> 34:01.180]  but you've always thought that the window style taskbar the way that you can minimize and and and organize windows and stuff like that and
[34:01.180 --> 34:03.180]  Apps is more to your liking
[34:04.660 --> 34:06.660]  Also worth checking out
[34:06.980 --> 34:08.980]  all sorts of little touches
[34:09.420 --> 34:11.420]  the developer Edward
[34:11.420 --> 34:16.740]  Brower is it's really really focused on the details his hobby. I've actually been emailing him. He's
[34:17.580 --> 34:21.420]  His hobby is making mechanical watches, which is just funny that you know
[34:21.420 --> 34:25.460]  The timing that it's when we're talking about watches, but he does really really amazing looking
[34:26.260 --> 34:28.260]  mechanical watches that he creates himself
[34:28.580 --> 34:31.980]  And it's like that level of detail in you bar
[34:31.980 --> 34:37.460]  Like the kind of thing that you'd expect from somebody whose hobby is making high-end mechanical wristwatches
[34:38.500 --> 34:44.140]  So badges just it's just one example of the sort of detail little red circles you get on an app icon
[34:45.580 --> 34:49.580]  You bar does it in a way where no matter how many apps you have down there in the bar?
[34:49.580 --> 34:55.980]  the badge always stays at a size that's readable as opposed to Apple's method where they just turn into little red dots in the
[34:55.980 --> 34:57.980]  Corner of the window and you can't read them
[34:59.420 --> 35:01.340]  That's one example
[35:01.340 --> 35:03.340]  He's got a thing called activity mode
[35:03.340 --> 35:09.660]  You hold down the control key on your keyboard and all the app tiles they switch from having their name underneath
[35:09.660 --> 35:15.620]  Which in itself is a difference from the Apple app or you can actually have like the name of the app the name of
[35:15.620 --> 35:17.620]  The window that you've minimized down there
[35:17.620 --> 35:24.000]  Well, those names change when you hold down the control key and they show you CPU and RAM usage instead
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.000]  So it's also a replacement for activity viewer
[35:27.840 --> 35:30.200]  So if you feel like there's an app that may you know
[35:30.200 --> 35:34.200]  You're worried that this which app is using the most CPU just put your mouse over the you bar
[35:34.200 --> 35:36.840]  Hold down the control key and it shows you exactly what's going on
[35:38.320 --> 35:39.520]  Sort of thing for everybody
[35:39.520 --> 35:39.800]  No
[35:39.800 --> 35:45.680]  Of course not sort of thing for nerds who want to run activity monitor awesome feature really really cool
[35:45.680 --> 35:50.680]  Helps you kill anytime you have an app that gets wedged that sort of app that you have to force quit
[35:51.160 --> 35:55.680]  You don't have to go hunting for it. It just shows you right there and you bar once an app is unresponsive
[35:56.680 --> 35:59.320]  It gets like a special background color so you can tell right away
[36:00.800 --> 36:02.800]  Plenty of custom
[36:02.800 --> 36:07.700]  Customizability tons of it. There's a dark theme like dark mode in Yosemite a light theme
[36:08.220 --> 36:10.800]  That looks like the the menu bar in Mavericks
[36:10.800 --> 36:17.480]  You can add apps files. You can have favorites that always show up instead of just showing you what's running
[36:18.720 --> 36:25.640]  Version 2.0 came out in July. It's already up to version 2.2 6. He's updating it regularly
[36:25.640 --> 36:28.280]  It's really under heavy active development
[36:29.720 --> 36:35.560]  It bottom line his goal is he's working to make this the dock replacement for OS 10
[36:35.560 --> 36:40.560]  So if you're the sort of user who wants to replace your doc, you like tinkering with system utilities and stuff like that. Check out
[36:42.000 --> 36:44.000]  You bar
[36:45.160 --> 36:48.240]  Normally sells for 20 bucks
[36:50.240 --> 36:52.240]  But if you use the coupon code
[36:53.040 --> 36:58.920]  Standard Gruber all one word standard Gruber you get 50% off
[36:58.960 --> 37:01.840]  So meaning you can get it for just 10 bucks
[37:02.680 --> 37:04.080]  and
[37:04.080 --> 37:06.840]  You can even better you can
[37:08.080 --> 37:10.080]  run it in demo mode for
[37:10.520 --> 37:17.240]  Four weeks so you get four full weeks to try it out before you have to decide really cool utility
[37:17.880 --> 37:21.960]  It's really well done. I think anybody who loves that sort of stuff should check it out. So
[37:23.680 --> 37:30.020]  My thanks to you bar for sponsoring the show save 10 bucks with coupon standard Gruber
[37:30.020 --> 37:32.020]  You
[37:32.740 --> 37:38.740]  Standard Gruber and I love that I prefer common Gruber. Yeah, maybe that'll be next week's code
[37:40.500 --> 37:42.820]  Just go to brower software.com
[37:43.620 --> 37:49.900]  That's B r a w e r s o f t w a re com
[37:49.900 --> 37:53.980]  B r a w e r brower software.com and

[37:57.340 --> 38:01.580]  Half price half price for talk show listeners great deal
[38:02.740 --> 38:05.220]  so let's let's go back and let's let's
[38:06.020 --> 38:09.460]  Let's get into the watch. So you've had an evolved
[38:10.500 --> 38:16.940]  Take on the watch like you even mentioned earlier in the show that your initial take was that this it was too unfocused
[38:17.980 --> 38:21.140]  And so start me down your path. What was your initial take?
[38:21.340 --> 38:25.980]  My I think I think your initial take represented an awful lot of people know for sure
[38:25.980 --> 38:28.820]  I mean, it's one of the it's one of the most popular articles I've had in quite a while
[38:28.820 --> 38:30.900]  Which which is funny cuz people like oh you just change your mind
[38:31.180 --> 38:36.260]  Well, well, I know actually the feedback was very was very positive in favor of that piece
[38:36.260 --> 38:39.860]  I'm not I'm not winning any brownie points by by switching
[38:40.740 --> 38:44.340]  basically, my criticism was primarily about the event I mean because I
[38:45.260 --> 38:48.260]  Wasn't there. I and obviously even people were there couldn't use the watch
[38:48.260 --> 38:55.180]  So it's hard to get too much into the actual details, but the event in general I compared and contrasted it to
[38:55.180 --> 39:01.900]  Previous new product introductions. So going back to the iPod going back to the iPhone and
[39:02.460 --> 39:04.460]  the iPad
[39:04.500 --> 39:06.500]  in all three cases
[39:08.340 --> 39:10.420]  Steve Jobs did a bit of exposition
[39:11.740 --> 39:19.100]  About why this product needed to exist, you know, what's the market? What's what's the problem people have what's out there?
[39:19.100 --> 39:25.220]  Oh, and here's our new thing and it happens to fit the market and take care of problems and all that sort of thing
[39:27.380 --> 39:28.700]  So
[39:28.700 --> 39:34.220]  That didn't happen with the watch what happens the watch is Tim Cook got on stage and he said oh, here's the next store
[39:34.220 --> 39:36.700]  You know, we're very excited. We've been working very hard
[39:37.060 --> 39:41.700]  Here's the next the next chapter in Apple's story and then boom a video popped up, you know
[39:41.700 --> 39:46.480]  Like it was it was a great video is you're showing the industrials on the watch and then it pops on screen and was like
[39:46.480 --> 39:54.120]  But that that piece about why does this exist where in the market as a goal was was missing and
[39:54.720 --> 40:02.500]  That was that I was concerning to me and it was that concern was amplified by the software demo
[40:02.640 --> 40:04.640]  Which to my mind?
[40:04.840 --> 40:06.560]  again
[40:06.560 --> 40:10.880]  Going into the event. I was thinking this was this was an accompaniment to the iPhone
[40:10.880 --> 40:15.320]  That's why it was being used with the iPhone. This was my thinking going into it and in that white
[40:15.320 --> 40:19.980]  I'm like, why are they doing a demo that doesn't leverage the iPhone like they were searching for movies on the watch
[40:19.980 --> 40:24.160]  They were looking at all these photos on the watch like well if you have an iPhone in your pocket
[40:24.160 --> 40:30.080]  Why wouldn't you use that to do this sort of stuff? And so I I'm like this demo is kind of weird
[40:30.080 --> 40:32.080]  They didn't say why?
[40:32.640 --> 40:35.520]  This has me a little worried about the about the whole concept
[40:37.040 --> 40:39.040]  Yeah, I just completely agree
[40:39.560 --> 40:43.380]  So why would I want to buy this? Yeah, why why what what do you know?
[40:43.380 --> 40:46.900]  What is the job to be done to use the the I?
[40:47.740 --> 40:51.700]  Was gonna say Horace, but I guess he took that from like Christianson
[40:51.940 --> 40:57.660]  Yeah, Clay Christensen, but you know, it's just a way to put it in context. But yeah, what what what are you hiring?
[40:57.740 --> 40:59.740]  the watch to do and
[40:59.740 --> 41:07.300]  I don't think they answered that but and I'm again a time will tell on this front. It's either a sign that
[41:08.820 --> 41:10.820]  That they have lost focus
[41:10.820 --> 41:14.980]  Post jobs and it is the first, you know
[41:15.020 --> 41:18.940]  we're either gonna look back at that introduction event as the first warning sign that
[41:19.620 --> 41:27.220]  Apple is in trouble and is going to isn't going to do the same good job with a new an altogether new product as they
[41:27.220 --> 41:28.340]  did before
[41:28.340 --> 41:33.320]  Or it'll be forgotten and it was because it was it was on purpose
[41:33.980 --> 41:36.740]  Yeah, well, it's either it's either one or the other either
[41:36.740 --> 41:41.420]  They purposefully left it largely mysterious and they're gonna save that why?
[41:42.300 --> 41:48.900]  For what? I presume to be the event in January or February where they're going to say, okay now it's going on sale
[41:48.900 --> 41:54.540]  And here's everything you need to know about it all the prices all the features
[41:54.820 --> 41:59.380]  Here's what the SDK can do, you know, all of that stuff is gonna come in a separate event
[42:00.140 --> 42:03.540]  And that they did this sort of teaser event
[42:03.540 --> 42:08.540]  For strategic reasons that will be clear after that watch actually comes out
[42:09.540 --> 42:13.340]  because that's the best to me that's the best way it's like the difference between a
[42:13.980 --> 42:18.980]  Preview that's supposed to tell you everything you need to know to make you want to go see this movie or a teaser
[42:18.980 --> 42:22.220]  That's just supposed to put the the movie into your head
[42:23.100 --> 42:28.820]  That's no that's a that's a that's a good analogy to think about it. I think there's also another explanation, too
[42:28.820 --> 42:31.540]  I think it's possible in January. It's even not
[42:31.540 --> 42:36.180]  Not as clear as it could be. And the reason that is is
[42:37.780 --> 42:44.220]  You know, I actually I cheated when I did that new product introduction because I didn't include the Mac
[42:45.220 --> 42:47.780]  And I actually I did go back and watch the Mac event
[42:47.780 --> 42:55.540]  but it didn't it didn't fit as neatly because the if you actually if you go back the Mac introduction was
[42:56.020 --> 42:58.020]  Almost identical to the watch introduction
[42:58.020 --> 43:04.100]  It was a job saying we've been working super hard this sort of thing and then like there's this long like
[43:04.740 --> 43:07.620]  What's what's the what's the song, you know the?
[43:10.260 --> 43:16.740]  Sockets I forget the name. I think it's chariots of fire or something like that. Um, oh no that right, right
[43:16.740 --> 43:20.980]  It wasn't the one from 2001. It was the chariots of fire song. Yeah, I think that I think so
[43:20.980 --> 43:25.780]  I don't remember the video I watched actually was I think five years ago
[43:25.780 --> 43:30.500]  The watch actually was I think for copyright reasons like them all the music was taken out
[43:30.500 --> 43:34.100]  But if I recall that that's what it was and then he pulls out
[43:34.100 --> 43:34.340]  You know
[43:34.340 --> 43:40.660]  It reveals the reveals the Mac like it was very it's funny like it actually ended up being a lot like the watch
[43:41.220 --> 43:45.860]  Um, and I'm not sure that's a great precedent obviously in the long run the Mac turned out
[43:45.860 --> 43:50.020]  Well, but as we just discussed it had a bit of a struggle at the beginning but at the same time
[43:50.900 --> 43:52.900]  If if you look back at the iPhone
[43:52.900 --> 43:58.020]  Nothing in that event was actually very pertinent to the way we use iPhones today
[43:59.620 --> 44:03.620]  And that didn't make the event a bad event. It remains an amazing event
[44:04.180 --> 44:10.100]  You know kind of like Steve Jobs is like all-time, you know on the all-time great hit list. It's it's number one
[44:11.460 --> 44:16.660]  But at the same time when you're creating a platform when you're creating a new thing
[44:17.220 --> 44:20.500]  That that is gonna create all kinds of new opportunities
[44:20.500 --> 44:26.260]  It's almost by definition impossible to know at the beginning what what that's all gonna be remember. I mean Steve Jobs
[44:26.340 --> 44:29.540]  I know there's confusion. There's contention if Steve Jobs did or didn't want the App Store
[44:29.620 --> 44:31.620]  I'm in the camp that believes he did not want it
[44:31.940 --> 44:39.140]  He thought that Apple could meet all the needs that the phone ought to serve when actually that that wasn't even close to being true
[44:39.620 --> 44:42.980]  And I think there's a way to look at this watch event and that Apple
[44:43.300 --> 44:49.460]  Maybe they didn't articulate as well as they could have but they're there they now realize that they know that we create platforms
[44:49.460 --> 44:53.460]  There's no way we can ever even fully know what this is going to do and
[44:54.500 --> 44:57.460]  But we've created the foundation for something really great
[44:58.580 --> 45:03.060]  I'm of the opinion. I think it's pretty clear. He didn't want an App Store in
[45:03.940 --> 45:09.220]  2008 which is when the actual App Store came out. I think that his I think he I
[45:10.580 --> 45:12.100]  I think that he
[45:12.100 --> 45:15.780]  Must have known that eventually they would do it. But I think that he thought it was a
[45:15.780 --> 45:21.140]  This does not need to be a top priority for the next year. You know, we've got so many things to do, you know this
[45:21.860 --> 45:26.020]  First phone is so, you know has so much room for improvement
[45:26.260 --> 45:32.900]  The last thing we need to worry about is the the App Store SDK angle right and all the limitations that imposes on you and things
[45:33.140 --> 45:36.260]  right, I think that if you had had if we could go back in time and have a
[45:37.300 --> 45:43.540]  Honest discussion with Steve Jobs in the summer of 2007, you know, and people had started jailbreaking
[45:43.540 --> 45:49.060]  You know, I mean like in July, I mean like weeks after the thing came out like to me
[45:49.060 --> 45:56.180]  That's still it's one of the great things in in indie Mac development history was the the way that you know
[45:57.780 --> 46:03.780]  The first couple of developers who jumped on that I mean like the first version of Twitter if it was written before there was a
[46:05.300 --> 46:11.700]  An SDK like Hockenberry had a version a Twitter client running on the iPhone before there was an SDK
[46:11.700 --> 46:13.700]  I
[46:13.700 --> 46:15.460]  Love that
[46:15.460 --> 46:22.740]  But the demand it was just I think he just underestimated how badly the people who became indie iOS developers wanted to
[46:23.300 --> 46:25.300]  Be able to do that
[46:25.300 --> 46:30.900]  but I do think you're right to that he you know is the nature of his personality was such that he assumed that his what he
[46:30.900 --> 46:34.500]  Wanted the phone to do was what most people would want it to do and it would cover
[46:35.220 --> 46:40.740]  A broader swath of you know, why people would want it to do and it would cover
[46:40.740 --> 46:46.500]  Why people would want it and that's what's so interesting about this is a lot of the people who are disagreeing with me now
[46:46.580 --> 46:52.260]  So my position now like has evolved to the I don't think Apple is making an accessory
[46:52.260 --> 46:56.740]  I think they're making a new platform a lot of people would disagree with that
[46:57.460 --> 47:02.540]  Want want the Apple defined vision? They want it super clear on what it's going to do
[47:02.780 --> 47:09.060]  But and they and they reference again. I did the same thing. So I'm not like by any means criticizing
[47:09.060 --> 47:13.620]  I think is a very valid point of view they reference kind of like the iPhone but
[47:14.580 --> 47:20.180]  The Steve Jobs's vision for the iPhone ended up being too small in a lot of ways
[47:20.180 --> 47:23.060]  I mean that that's that's not true in a big sense
[47:23.060 --> 47:28.060]  But in this kind of narrow sense about what ought to run on it it and when?
[47:28.660 --> 47:31.540]  You ought to enable all that stuff to run on it
[47:31.540 --> 47:38.020]  And yeah, not just not just too small in the 3.5 inch diagonal like too small in the conceptual sense
[47:38.020 --> 47:40.020]  right exactly and and
[47:40.700 --> 47:42.700]  You know, it's a great
[47:43.180 --> 47:50.180]  For all for for the kind of pining that this sort of talk can inspire for Steve Jobs and
[47:50.500 --> 47:55.660]  For his way of interesting products and the way he was such a master, you know, it's textbook
[47:55.660 --> 47:59.020]  Like this isn't like particular to Steve Jobs. He just did it better than anybody else
[47:59.020 --> 48:04.180]  Like he was the best salesman in the world. Like you have this problem. Oh, you're right
[48:04.180 --> 48:08.460]  I do have that problem. Look at the competition. They don't really work man. Yeah, they all suck
[48:08.460 --> 48:12.220]  Oh, look wouldn't it be great if there was something that met all your needs. That'd be awesome
[48:12.220 --> 48:18.420]  Oh, look who we should introduce. Here's my money. Take it, right? I mean, he just walked you through that so perfectly
[48:19.300 --> 48:20.900]  and
[48:20.900 --> 48:23.780]  And I do think that's in some ways missing
[48:23.780 --> 48:30.220]  but at the end of the day the needs he ended up selling weren't the ones that were actually key to the product or
[48:30.220 --> 48:32.100]  What made it wildly broadly?
[48:32.100 --> 48:33.180]  successful
[48:33.180 --> 48:34.340]  Yeah
[48:34.340 --> 48:36.220]  But they were good enough to get it off the ground
[48:36.220 --> 48:40.700]  I mean and you know what those those things are still reflected in the
[48:41.460 --> 48:44.740]  default dock of the iPhone today
[48:45.380 --> 48:51.400]  Right the Steve Jobs an iPod iPhone. I say iPod. I said iPod, but I'm an iPhone
[48:51.400 --> 48:55.800]  the dock the four I apps at the bottom phone
[48:56.800 --> 48:58.120]  mail
[48:58.120 --> 48:59.800]  Safari and
[48:59.800 --> 49:04.200]  It was called iPod back then that's where I started getting tripped up and now it's music
[49:05.120 --> 49:09.520]  That's what he wanted, right? He wanted a device that would play his music and
[49:10.120 --> 49:15.640]  It would it would be his cell phone and he could throw out whatever piece of garbage for Motorola. He was using at the time
[49:15.640 --> 49:22.160]  He could do his email and he could browse the web and there you go. There's the product and that was awesome
[49:22.160 --> 49:26.600]  That alone would have been enough right and the thing is is like I think Apple
[49:27.080 --> 49:30.720]  But it wouldn't have been enough. It would have been enough to make it a compelling product
[49:30.720 --> 49:36.960]  It would not have been enough to make it a world-changing product, which is what it you know has eventually become right?
[49:36.960 --> 49:38.960]  No that that's exactly it and I think
[49:39.480 --> 49:42.960]  the reason why and this is what makes the watch interesting is
[49:42.960 --> 49:47.300]  Apple actually in some ways has has some of those pieces there
[49:47.300 --> 49:50.500]  Like there's a slide where Tim Cook has like the three things like it's a great timepiece
[49:51.420 --> 49:55.940]  It's health and fitness and it's like the most personal communications device or something
[49:55.940 --> 50:01.180]  I think those were the three three items. So the fact that I can't remember it clearly is indicative
[50:02.820 --> 50:04.820]  Yeah, yeah now the personal
[50:05.540 --> 50:12.100]  Well, maybe the personal communication right that the three things that they're kind of selling to watch on it at the event this month
[50:12.100 --> 50:13.300]  the weather
[50:13.300 --> 50:15.300]  fitness tracking
[50:15.940 --> 50:17.940]  Timetelling yep, and
[50:18.940 --> 50:23.100]  The personal communication. Well, the thing is those like I mean I
[50:24.020 --> 50:28.900]  Even more so than the phone like the use case for the phone was so obvious, right?
[50:28.900 --> 50:33.240]  It just to make a better just to make a better phone would have been enough to sell a lot
[50:35.340 --> 50:39.540]  Just to make a better Nike fuel ban is not enough to sell a lot
[50:39.540 --> 50:46.260]  Because the the you're not same with the iPod just to make a better music player was enough to sell a lot
[50:47.020 --> 50:52.340]  Because what was the alternative to carry your computer around like the alternative was was a non-starter
[50:52.900 --> 50:57.500]  the alternative to a watch is to use the phone in your pocket like the the
[50:58.420 --> 51:00.420]  competition for even
[51:00.940 --> 51:05.340]  Considering buying a watch in the first place is far steeper
[51:05.340 --> 51:11.180]  Today than it was for any any product except for maybe the iPad is probably the best is
[51:11.580 --> 51:15.860]  Probably the best comparison here. Like why would you buy an iPad if you already if you already have a Mac?
[51:16.420 --> 51:18.940]  and so for that reason I
[51:19.500 --> 51:21.180]  This is the biggest thing that changed my mind
[51:21.180 --> 51:26.500]  Like I think Apple releasing a focus product would have meant a niche product that would never
[51:26.700 --> 51:31.740]  Get great traction because it would never be the Delta over just pulling a phone
[51:31.740 --> 51:37.060]  You're popular never been great enough. Like they needed a swing for the fences and it's probably raising risk, right?
[51:37.060 --> 51:41.780]  But the way you would get a great return is by taking on greater risk. And I think that's what Apple's done. I
[51:43.700 --> 51:46.140]  Very very very much in agreement with that. I
[51:47.420 --> 51:53.540]  Think was your piece your piece actually your phone piece that triggered this particular realization. So I'm
[51:54.060 --> 51:59.380]  I'm glad to hear you're in agreement. Wait, which phone piece the the observations on
[51:59.380 --> 52:06.140]  Initial observations on the phone basically you kept you kept referring to the fact that if Apple would have only done
[52:06.500 --> 52:11.660]  Like a notifications and tracker device you'd been worried about the future of the company or something along those lines
[52:11.660 --> 52:13.660]  I'm like, why is he being so hyperbolic?
[52:13.860 --> 52:15.860]  and then I basically
[52:15.980 --> 52:22.620]  Thought about it. It was like well that triggered that's what triggered me thinking through like what if they only did this
[52:22.620 --> 52:25.580]  What would be the implications of that and that's my piece this week
[52:25.580 --> 52:30.140]  Like if they only did that there would actually be a lot of long-term negative effects
[52:31.460 --> 52:38.060]  From limiting the potential of the platform to limiting the potential market all of which would be bad for very bad for Apple
[52:38.060 --> 52:43.540]  And which is why I think they rejected that approach and I presume was your your thinking as well
[52:44.700 --> 52:46.700]  yeah, I think so a
[52:47.820 --> 52:51.380]  Little thing just a side note one thing that they've said publicly
[52:51.380 --> 52:57.820]  I think they said it at the event or at least they said it after the event in like on the record
[52:58.180 --> 53:04.460]  Statements not like off the record and then I think Tim Cook repeated it in his interview with Charlie Rose
[53:04.460 --> 53:07.060]  Which was excellent really really interesting
[53:08.860 --> 53:13.060]  Just one of the the best interviews I've ever seen with anybody related to Apple ever
[53:15.820 --> 53:20.100]  But that they came out and said that they've been working on this for three years and
[53:20.100 --> 53:23.340]  They never ever say stuff like that
[53:24.340 --> 53:27.500]  They are super secretive about how long they've been working on stuff
[53:27.500 --> 53:31.980]  they never said how long they were working on the iPhone and it took years and
[53:32.580 --> 53:36.660]  stuff that was I think mostly off the record for it to come out that
[53:36.820 --> 53:40.700]  the way that the iPhone came about was that they were working on a tablet and
[53:41.180 --> 53:45.960]  The tablet got pretty cool and they had this moment where they were like, wait a second
[53:45.960 --> 53:52.720]  Screw this tablet size for now. Let's take this tech and shrink it. Can we shrink it to be a phone?
[53:53.600 --> 53:57.000]  Boom, there's the phone. They don't they don't they never talked about that
[53:57.000 --> 54:02.080]  They didn't talk because they don't want people to know how they were right. There's something part of the new
[54:02.640 --> 54:07.600]  Tim Cook Apple is the simple fact that they said that they've been working on this for three years and
[54:07.920 --> 54:10.520]  I can't help but think that part of that is
[54:11.520 --> 54:14.720]  that they kind of want to say this whole thing is
[54:14.720 --> 54:22.520]  After Steve because three years is how long ago Steve Jobs died like I don't think that's a coincidence
[54:22.640 --> 54:29.080]  That they're saying that publicly and it's a way of saying that I think it's a sign of their confidence in the watch
[54:29.160 --> 54:33.040]  But they're setting it up in advance that they think this thing is they're on to something
[54:33.240 --> 54:38.520]  They think it's gonna be huge and they don't want people to say well bet Steve Jobs invented
[54:38.520 --> 54:44.400]  It's probably the last thing he invented now show me something that you can invent, you know without Steve Jobs. That's interesting
[54:44.400 --> 54:46.400]  Yeah, that makes total sense
[54:46.600 --> 54:47.640]  So for example
[54:47.640 --> 54:53.520]  I remember when I got to take that antenna tour after antenna gate and they took a bunch of us back into their
[54:53.920 --> 54:55.920]  antenna testing lab and we got to see
[54:57.960 --> 54:59.960]  You know these cool
[55:00.560 --> 55:02.560]  Chambers where they test these things. I
[55:03.960 --> 55:09.480]  Forget the guy's name, but he's the antenna engineer who and he led the tour and he was a little nervous
[55:09.480 --> 55:13.280]  He did great, but he was a little nervous because he's just is not used to speaking to the press
[55:13.280 --> 55:17.080]  He's you know, he's an Apple employee. This is the last thing he does is speak to the press and
[55:17.720 --> 55:21.440]  You know a week prior, you know, he had no idea
[55:21.440 --> 55:26.000]  It was like this antenna thing blew up and within the course of a week now here
[55:26.000 --> 55:30.000]  He is leading 20 people around apples, you know lab
[55:31.000 --> 55:32.040]  and
[55:32.040 --> 55:39.520]  Schiller and Katie cotton were part of the group too, but they you know just were walking around sort of supervising and somebody asked at one point
[55:40.740 --> 55:42.740]  they were talking about the
[55:42.740 --> 55:44.300]  external
[55:44.300 --> 55:47.260]  antenna design which was brand new on the iPhone 4
[55:48.160 --> 55:50.160]  nobody else had ever done it and
[55:50.760 --> 55:53.580]  Initial reaction from a whole bunch of people was well, that's a stupid idea
[55:53.580 --> 55:59.500]  The reason nobody else does that is it's a bad idea and then the antenna gate thing came up and they said hey
[55:59.500 --> 56:03.500]  You touch it here and you lose your cell phone and they were like see told you a terrible idea
[56:03.740 --> 56:06.980]  Apple is you know, a terrible engineering company blah blah blah blah blah
[56:07.100 --> 56:11.220]  Well, we were talking about it with him on the tour and somebody I don't know who but you know
[56:11.220 --> 56:16.380]  One of the writers asked well, how long have you guys been working on that antenna design?
[56:16.380 --> 56:23.180]  And he was gonna answer honestly and Schiller immediately jumped in and said we're not gonna talk about how long we've been working on the antenna
[56:23.180 --> 56:27.300]  Design, I mean like just cut him right off. It was a sort of an awkward moment
[56:29.140 --> 56:33.640]  Because that was something they did not want to say, you know, they wanted to say how the you know
[56:33.640 --> 56:36.260]  This antenna is actually is a good design trust us
[56:36.260 --> 56:41.780]  You know, this is going to work out this this issue with the attenuation when you touch it at the wrong spot
[56:41.980 --> 56:43.980]  It's a real thing, but it's not that big a deal
[56:45.020 --> 56:50.480]  But there was no way that they were gonna mention how long that this guy had been working on an external antenna design
[56:51.780 --> 56:56.620]  Yeah, that's interesting a Ruben and that's just the antenna design let alone saying, you know
[56:56.620 --> 57:01.480]  We went from scratch to shipping. I watch in three or Apple watch in three years
[57:01.480 --> 57:08.000]  Yeah, no for sure. I mean it the the whole Apple PR thing is interesting. It's funny. You mentioned the tour of the labs
[57:08.600 --> 57:15.360]  I wrote about this in my in my daily update this week where that that that was a good 22 days
[57:15.360 --> 57:21.820]  I think after the antenna gate story first broke on on gizmodo of all places
[57:22.700 --> 57:28.900]  Whereas this week two days after the bent iPhone story broke. They were already getting people tours of the labs
[57:28.900 --> 57:33.860]  I think they really learned their lesson on getting ahead getting ahead of such things
[57:35.300 --> 57:41.780]  Yeah, should we take should we take a tree interrupt the watch to talk about Ben Ben Ghazi Ben gate, uh, I
[57:42.500 --> 57:46.020]  Mean, I think in ten a gate is probably the best way to think about it
[57:46.020 --> 57:52.720]  I mean the iPhone 4 was on sale until I think a week ago when it sold hundreds of millions of units, right?
[57:52.820 --> 57:55.560]  And I think that's pretty much all that needs to be said
[57:55.560 --> 58:00.560]  I mean the idea that Apple would not would not be aware or have tested this sort of thing is
[58:01.340 --> 58:04.820]  preposterous and given their track record I
[58:07.340 --> 58:12.620]  Very willing to even benefit out and then I got as someone who's criticized Apple in in various forums
[58:12.620 --> 58:18.460]  Like I'm not it's it's preposterous to suggest that they didn't know or didn't have a particular
[58:18.620 --> 58:22.880]  Tolerance that that the phone the reason the reason it takes any hold though
[58:22.880 --> 58:27.400]  Is that it plays into the misconception stereotype of Apple?
[58:27.580 --> 58:35.060]  Right that they would do something like make an antenna design that looks awesome and save space to make the device thinner
[58:35.060 --> 58:39.400]  But then have it not even be able to make phone calls. Like that's the worst you you know, the worst
[58:39.940 --> 58:41.940]  Stereotype of Apple you could imagine
[58:43.300 --> 58:47.300]  And it's such a delicious sound bite, you know world-famous
[58:47.300 --> 58:53.820]  Iphone new new model can't make phone calls. It sounds so amazing
[58:53.820 --> 58:57.940]  And then that you know, it's it's the perfect type thing for broadcasts, right the TV people
[58:58.700 --> 59:01.300]  Really are the ones that made that catch fire
[59:02.220 --> 59:07.860]  And the bend thing is exactly the same, you know Apple so desperately, you know
[59:08.700 --> 59:10.700]  or not desperate but
[59:11.020 --> 59:12.740]  over
[59:12.740 --> 59:19.060]  Interested obsessed with making devices thinner made a phone so thin that it bends when you put it in your pocket, right?
[59:19.060 --> 59:22.780]  No, yeah, I think I I think the the key thing too is
[59:23.380 --> 59:26.500]  As you just said like there was an antenna issue
[59:26.660 --> 59:30.900]  It just it's just an issue of and so when the Verizon iPhone came out six months later
[59:31.740 --> 59:37.020]  There was a different antenna design and so like it's not to say that there's not a problem
[59:37.020 --> 59:39.340]  I don't think either of us are saying that I mean clearly
[59:39.340 --> 59:45.700]  You know Matt Matt honing in a thing and wired and his his phone bent and I have no reason to to doubt him
[59:46.780 --> 59:50.980]  But at the same in so I would imagine if the six plus s or whatever
[59:50.980 --> 59:54.780]  It's gonna be called next year comes out that there's gonna be something
[59:55.380 --> 59:59.860]  Slightly different in the chassis or even right now that I'm making changes now to restrict it
[59:59.860 --> 01:00:04.340]  But at the same time like there's there's a very wide Canyon between
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:10.100]  There are very isolated circumstances where this might happen to oh my god, the house is on fire
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:15.580]  That's coming down right? And I think that's that's what's so frustrating about about these sort of
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:17.460]  gates
[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:21.700]  Yeah, well, it's in it's that that that adage that
[01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:28.860]  It requires an order of more of magnitude more effort to refute bullshit than it does to create it
[01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:32.500]  It's so hard. It's the fact that it's bullshit
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:39.700]  That makes it so hard to refute, you know, like compare and contrast with the the eight point. Oh one iOS update that that
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:45.700]  Effectively bricked a bunch of iPhone sixes. I mean, I think Apple said today it affected about and wound up
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:49.780]  It was out in a wild and wound up affecting like 40 or 50 thousand phones
[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:56.020]  Which is I guess good compared to the you know, 200 million people using iPhones in the world
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:01:00.940]  But still 40 or 50 thousand people who just within the last week have spent
[01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:07.140]  Upwards of six seven eight hundred dollars on a new phone had a software update that rendered their phone unusable
[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:09.940]  And there was a solution. They didn't have to take it back
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:11.940]  It wasn't like the phones were permit, you know
[01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:17.540]  You just had to go through a hassle of downloading it in iTunes and syncing it to a PC and I'm sure that's actually also
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:23.540]  Above beyond the technical Ken of many users and so some people probably did have to go to a store
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:25.540]  You know go to an Apple store and get it fixed
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:28.540]  But it was a real issue. It was a real problem
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:34.940]  It was an actual botched iOS update and Apple, you know issued a statement that said we're really sorry
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:40.620]  We screwed this up. This was terrible. Sorry, we're working on a fix as fast as we can. Sorry
[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:46.620]  Do we do we mention that we're sorry and it was over, you know, that's it. It was a real issue
[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:52.540]  They dealt with it. Everybody kept it in perspective because it was real right and it's I don't know
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:56.620]  I said this with Marco before cuz I know Marco I think his name is
[01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:59.540]  Marco before cuz I know Marco I think his wife had this problem
[01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:04.980]  But with the iPhone 4 there was an actual really bad technical problem, which was the the sensors
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:10.180]  That you know the ones that when you hold it up to your face remember that it was
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:12.860]  They did not work correctly at all
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:19.580]  And that was a real thing and it was really affecting people with the phone and there was nothing you could do, you know
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:21.660]  it's
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:27.260]  You know, it was a real thing and it got like one one thousandth the publicity that the antenna thing did
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:34.660]  You know and meanwhile like you said the iPhone 4 was on sale until two weeks ago in some parts of the world
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:42.540]  GSM not the Verizon one the GSM iPhone 4 with an absolutely unchanged antenna layout was on sale
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:45.300]  until last week it sold, you know, it was
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:50.180]  Tremendous numbers for years and years and years and everybody just sort of forgot it
[01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:52.940]  But yet people still bring it up on Twitter last night
[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:58.540]  Hey, there's Diaz even brought up as I can it somebody said something like this is the worst part of the tech press
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:04.240]  And and he was like the worst part is, you know people like Gruber who still denied denied antenna gate
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:07.940]  People are still hung up on that
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:12.100]  People still think that there was like in their twisted view of history
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:16.920]  They think Apple had a phone that couldn't make phone calls and that everybody just sort of brushed it under the rug
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:21.240]  Yeah, no, there's always a lack of context
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:27.320]  it was interesting is like Apple in some ways has benefited right because they they weren't criticized for the sense of the iPhone 4 and
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:32.060]  This week in you could argue they've gotten less criticism. They deserve for the
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:38.880]  8.0.1 update which that's a terrible terrible bug and it it's very
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:45.240]  concerning about how that gets released and there's there's a wide like there's so much potential for
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:47.240]  Actually real serious
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:50.260]  investigation and criticism as opposed to you know
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:57.180]  Bullshit outing someone's name crap that that Bloomberg pulled but like there's a very real issue
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:03.020]  I think part of the reason it was it was not really focused on was because everyone was talking about Ben gate
[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:07.980]  And it's yeah that it's frustrating as someone
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:10.540]  You know that want
[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:16.740]  Once if you want Apple to create good products, you should be way more worried about 8.0.1 in my opinion
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:18.740]  They should be worried about the Ben thing
[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:23.060]  Yeah, because it's the sort of thing that could happen, you know, it feels like it could happen to me
[01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:23.680]  It could have happened to me
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:23.940]  I
[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:29.500]  Happened to not been paying attention at the time that it was out and in the wild and by the time I was I knew
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.760]  Not you know to ignore the update
[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:34.740]  But I could have easily, you know installed that
[01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:39.920]  And the other thing I think long-term that that issue
[01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:46.080]  You know that the 801 update does that I think is harmful is it puts the seed out there that hey
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:52.320]  Be careful of of updating your I feel because it could be ruined and then it makes some number of people
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:59.440]  less reluctant to stay up to date which hurts Apple and developers in the long run by you know
[01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:01.740]  increasing fragmentation
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:03.740]  that that's a that's a great point and
[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:05.060]  um
[01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:07.060]  No, it's it's a great point
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:11.860]  But you know again lost lost in the shuffle of you know, the great Ben gate
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:18.940]  Scandal of 2014. Yeah, the Ben Ghazi name is funny for some reason though. I just can't quite adopt it
[01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:21.100]  I've stuck with I stuck with Ben gate. Yeah
[01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:25.940]  That's yeah, I think that the the real Ben Ghazi
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:30.980]  I think it's such an overblown fake scandal not that the tragedy of the people dying is not serious
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:36.020]  But the idea that there's anything that was being covered up is just a bunch of right-wing nonsense
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:39.540]  But the people who believe it are really really into it and think it's you know
[01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:45.660]  the most important under reported political story of the entire Obama administration and I
[01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:51.500]  Guess it's best to stay away from joking about it. So if you're out there and you're offended by me joking about it
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:54.300]  I I retract the joke because it's not that funny a joke
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:59.820]  It was just so happens though that it's such it it is such it it verbally it works
[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:05.060]  So well, you just put a D in there and it's all of a sudden. Well, I mean, yeah, I mean that
[01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:10.660]  Again, whether it only works. I don't want to touch with a 10-foot pole, but right it only works as a joke though
[01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.660]  if everybody sees
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:19.660]  the real Ben Ghazi scandal the way I do as a completely overblown hype whereas if there's you know
[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:26.560]  20% of the people listening to the show think it's actually an outrage and a tremendous scandal then the you know
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:30.560]  It has the wrong effect because it makes it seem as though you know
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:35.680]  The Ben gate is bend gate is a real issue, right? No, that's exactly it
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:39.620]  And I I'm uh, that's the same reason I've been using Ben gate as well
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:43.720]  All right, even though it sounds like Ben gate, which is my name
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.560]  When he's not bad, but yeah
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:55.720]  Let's take another break here. Thank our next sponsor and it's our good friends at fracture
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:57.860]  fr a CT ure
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:05.560]  Everything all the photos we take, you know, we're talking about that digital cameras and all the photos we take with our iPhones
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:10.480]  You know, how sad is it that they all all of them end up trapped somewhere like in our camera roll on the phone
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.240]  or an Instagram feed
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:16.320]  And we end up looking at them on these tiny little well
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:21.760]  And I guess now some of the phone screens are not so tiny, but they're still relatively small. I
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:28.600]  I don't know. We lost something with them when we stopped getting photos printed and having something we can hang on the wall
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:33.640]  Well fracture that's exactly what they do. You send them your digital photos
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:40.740]  They print them directly on pure glass. So it's not like a piece of paper in a frame with glass in front of it
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:42.740]  They actually print on the glass
[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:46.160]  I've said this every time I say it's it's the same sort of effect
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:52.240]  like with these phones the way that the iPhone keeps getting the pixels closer and closer to looking like
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:58.080]  Pixels on glass as opposed to pixels under glass. That's the effect that fracture has with photos
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:03.440]  It looks like photos on glass, which is really what it is. And it's a really cool effect
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:08.060]  They come with a foam back that's ready to mount right out of the box
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:12.520]  You don't have to take it and then get a frame and put it in a frame and then hang it
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:18.700]  You just buy your fracture it shows up you open the cardboard box and there it is ready to hang on your wall or ready
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:22.180]  To put it up on your desk or wherever you want to put these photos
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:30.400]  Such a great service really really impressed with the quality of the output. We have a bunch of them here at home
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:35.280]  Also an amazing gift really great gift
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:40.400]  You know for family members if you want to send you know grandparents pictures of the kids or stuff like that
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:43.280]  And it's also a real cool talking point where they're like, whoa
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:47.160]  How did once they see how it you know, it's actually this thing printed on glass
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.300]  Nobody out there in the real world has heard of these guys yet
[01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:55.160]  So it makes you seem like you're you're totally in the know of like this amazing stuff really great gift
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:59.520]  And they have a cool code just for listeners of the show

[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:32.220]  my thanks to fracture
[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:38.020]  So so I think we've been a little all over the place on the watch, but I've been I've been very powerful
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:40.140]  I personally have been all over the place
[01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:46.260]  I've written four pieces now that have you know, there's kind of an arc where I'm more opposed all the way to
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:50.180]  I think this is really ambitious and potentially the future
[01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:55.100]  I'm but you've only written you've written the one you've written a couple
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:59.380]  you've linked to a few pieces with like a line or two of commentary like I
[01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:05.420]  I think I speak for a lot of your readers that is curious unlike the Gruber exposition of about the watch
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.260]  Yeah, I'm still working my way on that
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:14.740]  I thought I'd I thought I'd have something a week ago a second follow-up and I'm still it's still like in the liquid state
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:20.660]  It's not solidified. But you know this, you know, it's why I do the show. I can talk my way through it bottom line
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:25.300]  Here we are an hour and ten minutes into the show. Here's the thesis statement thesis statement is
[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:28.420]  Apple watch I believe is
[01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:34.500]  intended to be a completely standalone platform for compute personal computing and
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:38.900]  Its relationship to the iPhone. This is not wholly original
[01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:45.220]  I've heard other people say this, you know speculate but I'm gonna try to put it very clearly its relationship to the iPhone is
[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:51.300]  Very much analogous to the original iPhones relationship to iTunes running on your PC or Mac
[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:55.940]  Right, and when you got the first iPhone in 2007, you couldn't even activate it without iTunes
[01:10:55.940 --> 01:11:01.220]  You had to actually plug it into your computer and run iTunes and activate it on AT&T
[01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:08.020]  Through your Mac it was you know that they just didn't have the full stack. They didn't have everything
[01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:14.900]  Ready to go for it to be the standalone device that it is today where you can be a fully functioning
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:19.540]  iPhone user with no other computer products or you know
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:24.180]  You could just use it with an iPad and never pair the two and your backups go to the cloud
[01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:27.460]  Your software updates come over the cloud
[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:32.580]  And you never never connect it to a Mac or PC
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:38.580]  I think that's the relationship the watch will have with the phone where eventually it will do full Wi-Fi and
[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:44.180]  Eventually, it'll have a SIM card and it will be able to connect it to a Mac or PC
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:46.420]  And we'll do cellular networking
[01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:49.460]  And that doesn't mean you know
[01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:54.500]  and again this comes to one of the topics on ATP like Marco's thing is never bet against the smartphone and
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:58.580]  It's a good point that the smartphone is sort of an optimal
[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:04.580]  It's sort of an endpoint, you know, and we're obviously, you know, the size can fluctuate a little bit
[01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:08.980]  But the basic idea of the thing that you can carry in your pocket don't bet against it
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:13.980]  You know there were some of us and myself included who thought that the iPad might grow to be bigger than the iPhone
[01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:17.660]  Or at least grow to be the same size and it's not it's super successful
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:23.020]  Tablets are a huge deal. The iPad is the most successful and it is very successful
[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:26.260]  But it is not as popular and not as successful as the phone
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:32.440]  So I wouldn't say that when I say that the watch will be a standalone platform that
[01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:37.740]  Won't need a phone that doesn't mean that everybody is going to ditch their iPhone and just do everything on the watch
[01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:41.300]  I just think it means though that some people they could
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:44.420]  That they won't have of they don't they won't need to carry a phone in their pocket
[01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:48.020]  So I
[01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:54.980]  I completely agree. I've said I actually made the same analogy on a previous version of exponent
[01:12:54.980 --> 01:13:01.940]  Where my co-host vehemently disagrees and we definitely got we definitely got into it, but I think the
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:16.300]  I think the the the phone for the watch is an implementation detail and I think that's that's critical to understanding the way Apple I think introduced it is because the
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:21.220]  Imagine that Apple had introduced the iPhone and they had said oh well
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:27.460]  You don't need to manage music on your phone because you can do it on iTunes on the back and it will all sink over
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:30.220]  Right, which is what they did did with the with the iPod
[01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:35.500]  The problem is is that would have you know a few years down the line
[01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:38.340]  It would have been so much more difficult
[01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:45.220]  If not impossible for Apple to make the iPhone a truly standalone device like from day one the iPhone
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:51.900]  Even though it even though it needed a Mac it had to be designed as if it didn't need a Mac
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:56.900]  In all these fundamental assumptions and I think it's the same thing
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:14:00.460]  It's the same thing with with the watch like you can't build in the assumption
[01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:05.220]  The phone is there if you know, it's gonna be going away else. You're limiting you're lowering the ceiling
[01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:10.900]  you're lowering the potential and I think the difference on the it from the iPad is this is smaller and
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:15.100]  when it comes to when it comes to
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:20.900]  Design is all about constraints and what's the controlling constraint the controlling constraint?
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:27.700]  When you're at your desk is not size. It's not weight. It's comfort. It's productivity
[01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:33.180]  It's why I'm sitting here in front of three monitors and an ergonomic keyboard and and a mouse
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:38.300]  but when you're moving around the chief constraint is
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:44.460]  Portability and the fact of the matter is is a watch is more portable than a phone
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:49.020]  So not next year not the year for that maybe not even five years on the road, but ten years down the road
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:52.780]  It's it's very easy in my opinion to see
[01:14:53.820 --> 01:15:01.340]  Me have carrying a much larger smartphone less frequently because I always have a watch I think
[01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:07.820]  Complete agreement except I think ten years is too long and it goes back to the Bill Gates adage
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:12.820]  Which is probably one of the smartest things he's ever said but that we as tech people
[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:17.580]  Perennially vastly overestimate how much we can do in one year and
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:22.620]  Underestimate how big the changes will be in ten years
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:29.460]  Over and over and over every year every decade. I think ten years is too long because just think about the phone man
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:32.700]  The phone is to only set it was only seven years ago that we had the original
[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:36.980]  I when did the phone become completely standalone?
[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:40.060]  When was it that I guess it was probably with iPhone
[01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:43.380]  It was it so that would have been that was that would have or was it or?
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:46.540]  It would have been I
[01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:48.940]  think
[01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:50.140]  20
[01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:56.700]  The iCloud right? I thought it was 2011 because it was alright John's last keynote. Yeah, Steve Jobs's last keynote, right, right
[01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:04.660]  Right. He did the original iPad introduction in 2010 and then he made a surprise appearance at the second iPad event when he was
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:09.700]  Technically on medical leave and he was like, you know, I didn't want to miss this and then he was at WWDC
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:11.700]  And that was the last time we saw him
[01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:19.900]  So 2011 so that was four years from when the original iPhone came out and at that point
[01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:23.540]  You know, it was you know, for call it five years give I you know
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:29.180]  I cloud a year to bake I guess but within five years the iPhone was a wholly independent platform
[01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:35.740]  And you know, it won't just be like one switch flipping. It's you know, do this then that then this then that you know
[01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:39.540]  I mean the original iPhone it's like I was thinking about it in the context of the watch
[01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:44.820]  It was crazy how little it did on its own. You had to sync your calendars and contacts through iTunes
[01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:49.540]  right just to get so if you wanted to have the same contacts on your phone and
[01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:55.420]  Computer you had to keep connecting it to iTunes and syncing that up
[01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:59.740]  I mean, it was crazy. So if part of that is tech, I think with the phone and you're right
[01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:04.700]  It's a lot of it comes to the constraints are different with the phone. It was more about
[01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:12.180]  just that there was just so much software that needed to be written before they could do it and being able to just
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:17.620]  Depend on iTunes in the meantime just was a very helpful crutch
[01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:21.140]  Because it was worth launching when they did
[01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:27.580]  It would not have been worth waiting another two or three years until they had more of that that whole stack ready to go
[01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:33.300]  And with the watch, I think it is more engineering right? Why doesn't it have a SIM card?
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:38.140]  I think I simple I think battery life and size size is an issue too, though
[01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:43.420]  Yeah, there is a Samsung one. I think that has a SIM card. But yeah, it's yeah, and it's way bigger, right?
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:45.420]  But the thing is like yeah, I would
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:48.980]  One thing that you've really enjoyed about the watch is that it has a battery life
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:53.500]  Yeah, I would one thing that you've learned over the years is never bet against
[01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:59.180]  Miniaturization and never bet against right Moore's law and I think you in the antenna because it's analog
[01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:01.960]  like there's a lot of real challenges there, but at the same time like
[01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:06.420]  if you've learned anything in tech, it's don't bet against like
[01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:09.700]  don't bet against that kind of stuff and
[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:12.380]  the the
[01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:18.900]  This question. This is thing that I came up again with James on my podcast is you know, where do you draw the line?
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:23.380]  on what features it's okay to ship with and what features it's okay to ship without and
[01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:30.360]  The way I draw the line is not by looking at the technical
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:33.140]  implementation or the of the feature
[01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:39.340]  But the impact it has on normal people's lives and what I mean by that is when the iPhone came out
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:46.820]  People were already plugging in their devices into their computer every night. Those devices just happen to be iPods
[01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:51.980]  So Apple was just asking you to keep doing the same thing. You were always doing and
[01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:57.580]  But with a different right exactly and so even though it was if we look back and think oh my gosh
[01:18:57.580 --> 01:19:04.340]  I had to plug in my phone to sync my calendars. It sounds ridiculous today. It did not sound ridiculous in 2007 and
[01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:08.180]  And so that's why I think was okay to not have that feature
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:13.280]  Because you weren't you weren't putting a burden on people you weren't making people's lives more difficult
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:16.540]  All right, and I think the same thing applies to the watch
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:18.800]  Yes, it would be
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:22.440]  There's no you don't need to wait for the watch to have its own cellular stack
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:28.700]  Because people already have their phones with them. You're not saying oh you have up to till today
[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:31.360]  You have not been carrying a cellular device in your pocket
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:35.060]  But now you need to carry it with you to use the watch. No people are already doing it
[01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:38.280]  You're the the watch is only making their lives better
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:43.280]  and I think I agree with you and I think it will be shorter than ten years in seven years say in
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:47.360]  2021 we'll look back and say man
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:52.160]  I can't believe I carried a phone in my pocket every single hour of every single day
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:55.800]  Yeah, it's so, you know, let's go back to
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:05.040]  Let's you know, like the Newton era like 1993 94 most people very few people had cell phones and the cell phones that route
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:10.360]  It was you know, the famous Wall Street, you know, it's more like a brick. So let's say Apple comes out with some kind of digital
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:14.360]  Watch in 1993 and the watch does something cool
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:17.720]  I don't know who do you know forget the details but it's you know
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:23.320]  But nobody has a habit of carrying a cell phone at the time and then they say oh and to make this watch work
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:25.280]  You have to carry this
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.920]  four or five inch
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:32.280]  Rectangle in your pocket with you everywhere you write and then everybody be like well that that seems stupid
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:37.640]  I don't want to carry that, you know, here's a five ounce thing that that is very expensive itself
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:43.480]  And you have to carry it around with you everywhere you go. That's you're asking people to do something. That is stupid, right?
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.400]  They're never gonna do that
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:51.600]  Like you're saying I completely agree that they can piggyback off the phone now for things like cellular and Wi-Fi
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:55.520]  Connectivity because
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:21:02.800]  Everybody in you know, the target audience of people who already carry an iPhone with them everywhere they go is is sufficiently large, right?
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:07.120]  and I think it's really interesting to just kind of
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  slight segue I guess is
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:16.760]  One thing I haven't done in any of my columns at least not as explicitly or in the podcast is like why?
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:21.520]  What if we what if we jump for like what what how do you think?
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:26.040]  How do you think our tech lives will look like in 2020? I
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:33.560]  I don't know. I I'm you know, but I have I'm very intrigued that they think this is the way it's gonna go
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:36.480]  You know that it's mostly you know
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:41.480]  That I think that they're predicting that a lot of it is gonna go to the wrist. I
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:48.360]  Think it's got to be a lot about voice input, you know, we're gonna be talking to our wrist a lot
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:51.880]  I mean, I don't see other any other way that you're going to I
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:57.480]  Don't see how they're ever gonna invent anything that would let you type on there on a piece on something that small. So
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:00.120]  Well, I think what's interesting though is
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:08.120]  Well, first off if you were to tell someone in 2007 how little we talk on the phone today. They might not believe you
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:13.920]  Right. So that's that's so I think the voice thing in general as far as communication will go ways
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:17.140]  Like what do we need Siri for text input then because we text a lot now
[01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:20.780]  I think what's interesting about the phone is
[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:22.940]  it's
[01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:29.200]  So actually if you track like everything you do in a day, how much of it are you actually inputting anything?
[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:35.420]  like how much of it is gathering information or absorbing information as opposed to actually
[01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:40.980]  You know putting something in and I suspect at least I tried to observe myself for a day
[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:43.480]  It was really hard. Like it was shocking how many times I pulled my phone in my pocket
[01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:45.460]  a
[01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:49.340]  lot of it is just just checking it's just checking stuff all the time and
[01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:54.980]  And all like that's it's not just that you could do that on a watch
[01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:59.500]  It's that it's better on a watch and I think the for me
[01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:05.000]  the vision is the watch you have something with you all the time and the things that that's with you all the time is
[01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:12.340]  Is where the radio should be it's where the connection should be and it's where kind of the hub should be and yes
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:16.660]  I'm sure we'll still have smartphones. I don't think they're going away just like we still have computers
[01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:21.380]  but I think it's gonna be more it's gonna be more about the screen and more about
[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:29.660]  And that's why I think the iPhone plus is the future and it's gonna be more dedicated to doing specific tasks as opposed to
[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:35.800]  Being everything the the end-all the end-all be-all right
[01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:38.060]  I
[01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:40.060]  think that
[01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:42.060]  There's a lot of
[01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:46.860]  Things that you just never gonna be done on the watch, but that's fine because there's still things that
[01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:49.680]  Never is maybe a stronger word
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:54.980]  But that you're almost never going to do on your phone right like if you have to write
[01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:57.460]  If you're a graduate student you have to write a dissertation
[01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:03.100]  You're probably not gonna do it on your iPhone even on an iPhone plus although it's a lot more plausible now than it was before
[01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:07.620]  Well, you're never gonna do that on your watch. You're never gonna write articles on your watch
[01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:10.900]  You're not gonna read articles, you know
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:17.180]  Like somebody like me or you writes a thousand word essay on the watch or whatever new product comes out in five years
[01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:21.980]  You're not gonna read it on your watch. Although you might have it read to you by Siri
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:28.060]  You know that that you know over Bluetooth, but you're not gonna actually read it visually like that
[01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:33.600]  But there's like you said there's an awful lot of things that you do read that are you know?
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:40.200]  And eminently readable and fitable on that screen that size not just that but this is where continuity I think is particularly interesting
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:47.920]  because if if the watch is always your first window into stuff your first encounter with something if you if it was totally
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:52.240]  Seamless for you to immediately transfer that to a more suitable device
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:56.680]  And not have to muddle around with syncing and all that sort of stuff
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:01.380]  You just you flick it over or something and now it's on your iPhone plus or you want to type something
[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:04.040]  So you put it over on your on your Mac like now
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:11.720]  I think that that's in a critical component like now a watch being the center makes a lot more sense if the if
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:18.080]  Transitioning content to more suitable devices is is totally frictionless and totally easy
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:20.840]  I'm sure continuity will not be there this year
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:28.640]  But what what what state will continuity be in in in five five years? Yeah, they are they keep using the word personal
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:30.640]  and
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:35.640]  They used it on stage. They reiterate in the website. It says it here Apple watch
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:42.960]  This is from Apple's website right in the overview Apple watch represents a new chapter in the relationship people have with technology
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:48.040]  It's the most personal product we've ever made because it's the first one designed to be worn
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.640]  I
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:56.680]  Do I think that you know that I don't think they use words like that lightly and I think that they mean it that we're
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:00.760]  Going to have the way that we have I think I at least I do personally I have more
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:07.440]  affection personal affection to my iPhone than any other product and more than the iPad
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.680]  certainly more than the iPad and and more even than the Mac even though I you know
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:17.760]  Started as you know a guy who most of it. I you know ten years ago
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:24.320]  I felt like I wrote more about Mac than I did Apple right like I never spent a lot of time at during fireball writing
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:29.280]  About the iPods. I mean I did but it was never as much interest to me as the Mac even as
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:36.540]  The iPod grew to dwarf the Mac in terms of its financial relevance to the company because it just wasn't what engaged me
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.960]  Whereas the phone does right now
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:42.280]  I think I write and think more about the phone than I do the Mac
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:45.880]  Even though I do all my writing and stuff on the Mac and I still love the Mac
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:51.520]  But it is there is something about the fact that it's with me all the time and it's that first
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:56.080]  You know first responder for my attention. Hey, I'm bored. Give me something to do
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:00.120]  it's the first thing I do that it's it is it is more personal and
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:06.320]  something on your wrist that you just have to twist your wrist to look at is another step up in
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:11.040]  being a personal relationship with technology from the phone and
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:16.280]  I don't you know, I think that they are they're not that's not those words aren't empty
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:21.360]  I think they really mean it and I think it's based on their own, you know usage internally of the thing
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:29.120]  And I think it's a reason to think why this will be a very successful category for Apple because you know
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:31.000]  that's
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:37.120]  every time technology gets more personal like laptops are more personal than desktops and
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:42.420]  I don't think it's any surprise that Apple's done better in laptops than they ever did in desktops
[01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:49.860]  Right tablets are more personal than than Macs and they've done more then they've done better in tablets than they ever did in PCs
[01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:57.700]  And phones are more personal yet. And that's their most successful product ever. I I do think it's it's totally reasonable
[01:27:57.700 --> 01:27:59.380]  I get where Mark was coming from
[01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:05.300]  I think as far as like a worldwide phenomenon like the device everybody will have I think that like
[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:09.580]  there's still that the Delta between a watch and a
[01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:17.040]  Phone, I'm not sure will ever be great enough to make it a universal like universally
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:19.940]  It will surpass the phone, but I think for a certain type of customer
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.720]  again, primarily an Apple customer
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:25.680]  You know as in what I mean is someone who's
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:33.720]  Tends to have a higher income tends to have a higher willingness to pay tends to be more focused on the experience of of using something
[01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:37.500]  And again, I say that in the gentlest way possible. So no email, please
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:39.500]  It
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:47.180]  It's a very compelling market and one that I think it I think each time you make this stuff be more personal apples addressable
[01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:50.180]  apples percentage of the addressable market increases
[01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:55.700]  Yeah, no, I totally agree. And that's a very keen observation on the shift
[01:28:55.700 --> 01:29:01.180]  You know as the industry shifted from desktop PCs to laptop PCs it coincides with Apple
[01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:08.280]  Rising out of the the decade-long malaise of PC market share. Oh for sure
[01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:12.980]  That's it's a great point. I actually I just said it but I didn't quite make the connection either
[01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:14.540]  I
[01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:20.060]  Mean the I met everyone looks at the iMac but this but even then the iMac was the first computer people willing to put in
[01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:21.180]  the living room
[01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:23.500]  But once it came to actually carrying something around
[01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:27.300]  No, it made it made a big difference. That's that's really interesting
[01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:31.420]  Yeah, I Mac was just like a stop the bleeding thing and
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:35.900]  It wasn't a get people who'd never considered a Mac to use a Mac thing
[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:39.620]  Whereas you know Mac books were the thing that really did that. I
[01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:44.180]  Keep coming back on the watch and as my belief that it's a true it
[01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:49.540]  in its own way and in ways that we don't fully understand yet because I think they're being either they're
[01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:53.700]  Working on it and they don't they can't really talk about it and be I think that they're very
[01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:58.940]  Deliberately being secretive for the next few months because they don't want to give a competitive leg up
[01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:05.040]  To the companies who they think are going to copy it as best they can as quickly as they can
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:10.220]  So I do think that they are being very cagey about some of the details here
[01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:14.540]  But I that's one of the things I'm finding hard to square. I'm convinced
[01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:17.980]  I don't know nobody at Apple said we're being pretty we're being secretive
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:23.940]  Because we don't want people to copy this but reading between the lines. It is sort of what I was told
[01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:30.780]  Not in so many words, but it does seem like it, you know in terms of why weren't why wasn't anybody at the event allowed to?
[01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:33.060]  try a
[01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:35.060]  version using the real software
[01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:42.620]  Part of it was that it wasn't ready but in 2007 the iPhone wasn't ready when they announced it, you know
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:50.020]  Some of the apps were just screenshots literally like I forget which ones but like like the maybe like the stock widget or something
[01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:54.940]  or a calculator like but but they let a handful of people like David Pogue and
[01:30:56.260 --> 01:31:02.900]  You know probably Walt Mossberg, I'm sure but a few of those guys on you know at January 2007 six months before it came out
[01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:05.980]  They got to play with a you know an iPhone
[01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:08.860]  They didn't hold anything back, you know
[01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:13.940]  the and even if some of the apps weren't finished yet and you just tap the app and it showed you a screenshot of what
[01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:18.220]  It would look like that was what it was going to do and what it was gonna look like and the apps they showed on
[01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:23.760]  Stage where the apps they shipped with they didn't do that with the with the watch and I think it's a secrecy type thing
[01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:26.920]  But I don't know how to square that with what I'm about to say
[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:29.580]  Which is I keep coming back and I know I told you this offline
[01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:35.140]  I keep going back to the image on Apple's website of the s1
[01:31:35.140 --> 01:31:41.540]  It's on you go to watch and I think you go to technology and you have to scroll down to get to it
[01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:46.180]  but you go to the Apple watch you go to explore you hit technology and you scroll down and
[01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:49.740]  They show the s1
[01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:56.620]  And they say here's what they say about an entire computer architecture on a single chip
[01:31:57.300 --> 01:32:04.180]  Massive constraints have a way of inspiring interesting creative solutions a prime example is the custom design chip at the heart of Apple watch
[01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:08.400]  No traditional computer architecture could fit within such a confined space
[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:13.920]  So we found a way to integrate many subsystems into one remarkably compact module
[01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:16.660]  module which is then completely
[01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:22.340]  encapsulated in resin to protect the electronics from the elements impact and we're
[01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:30.060]  Configuring an entire computer system on a single chip is an industry first and represents a singular feat of engineering and miniaturization
[01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:33.160]  They mentioned it in the event. They're promoting it here
[01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:36.940]  They're showing it. They're showing a guy, you know a man's hand holding this
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:44.640]  Tiny little chip, you know, I would I know it's an overused frame of reference, but a more or less
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:52.880]  Posted stamp size chip, but it doesn't look like a chip. There's no exposed electronics or transistors or anything like that. It is encapsulated
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:57.920]  and so even though they're being so secretive I feel like that
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:05.200]  They're bragging about the s1 and and they're showing it and showing that it's it's a module
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:11.500]  Suggests so much about how they're going forward. I think it suggests that the thing is a full computer
[01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:14.460]  It's not meant to be just a peripheral
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:19.260]  Which I think is what Android where is and there's we can come back to that
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:24.880]  You know my understanding of my Android where is that it's not in no way
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:30.680]  Meant in the long run to be a standalone computing device. It's a permanent risk-worn
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:35.740]  notification terminal for your phone for your Android phone I
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:40.480]  Think that in the way that in
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:46.620]  2007 when they when jobs first showed the iPhone and said and it runs OS 10, you know
[01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:49.560]  And that there was like a you know that the decades long
[01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:55.840]  Hey, what if Apple made a minute, you know stripped-down version of Mac OS that could run on a phone. Wouldn't that be great?
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:02.240]  Well, they did it and everyone's like blown away that they were able to have a computer that could run Unix, you know on a phone
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:08.860]  And with you know OS 10 style graphics and stuff like that for fortunately not with bash installed
[01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:16.000]  Right. I I think that they've taken a so it's a similar jump again in the same
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.720]  You know, I keep coming back to this that the iPhone is to the watch what the Mac was to the iPhone
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:24.280]  I think they've made a similar jump in like miniaturization
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:29.240]  And encapsulation with this and that it's you know, roughly
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:33.200]  You know in a way that it can be a computer. It's going to be a computer
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:37.400]  and the the modularity of it is what I think I
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:41.520]  Really do think that that's the explanation and we can get into this when we talk about pricing
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:48.140]  That's the explanation for why would somebody spend $10,000 on a gold one when two years. It's gonna be technically outdated
[01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:54.880]  Is that I think that you'll be able to take it in for service and have that s1 popped out and replaced with an s3
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:56.880]  Yeah, this this is super interesting
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:59.520]  Just one moment on that. I think the
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:07.040]  if I can go back to the Android where point for just a second and then I think the whole retail experience and the in the
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:09.040]  Potential upgrade ability is super interesting
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:11.160]  but
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:16.600]  I I think it's super significant you highlighted it. They call the s1 a computer like they
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:24.280]  Like this is the it's this is the fundamental point that that has changed where I've changed my thinking and is key
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:26.280]  Is that Apple makes computers?
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:32.840]  They don't make accessories the iPod was the exception and this is another computer and it has to be looked at in that in that
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:35.360]  Light, yeah, they're not using a different language
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:38.080]  You know when they call the a7 and a8 all a line
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:43.360]  They call them SOC systems on a chip and it's a CPU and RAM and I don't know what else
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:50.760]  You know on in one and it's it's more on a single chip than in a the PC world than we ever saw or have seen
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:54.720]  But it's not you would never call it a full computer on a chip
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:36:01.640]  Like they're calling it a full computer on a chip and which to me makes it sound as though if you replaced it with a different
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:03.640]  One you'd still have the same
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:10.720]  Screen, it's almost like turning a watch into like like a desktop PC like where you could replace your PC and keep your monitor
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:19.680]  like you can replace the computer in the watch and keep the gold case and the sapphire display and
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:25.520]  the crown and all of your bands that you bought and you just get a new computer inside I
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:31.420]  Just what I do want to just acknowledge that I think Android we're under the covers
[01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:34.740]  Could be standalone from a technical perspective
[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:39.820]  I just want this so we don't get bad email because people I've actually been looking into this
[01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:45.780]  But I think the design the design is always meant to be with a smartphone. So let's park that because
[01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:49.660]  Right about the watch but no this is this is this is so interesting though
[01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:54.020]  Because this is this is the thing that people think shouldn't be possible, right?
[01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:59.560]  There's always something right that shouldn't be possible right and the everyone thought that modularity was dead
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:03.300]  Right with MacBooks now, you can't change anything on your own
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:09.920]  The phone for sure remember when the phone came out and there was no external battery and people were going nuts about it
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:10.660]  Like oh my god
[01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:18.360]  there's no external battery and the thinking then was you can never make something small enough if you have the constraint of
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:22.540]  making stuff modular and being able to be easily removed, but
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:27.480]  What what it you know, I thought I thought about last time we talked
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:31.840]  I thought I want to be interesting if the wearable if Apple came up with it. Oh, it has no screen, right?
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:34.640]  That would be like oh my god, just like the phone. Oh, it has no keys
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:42.240]  Maybe the oh my god moment here is it is modular. It's it's a computer. It can be changed out. We've totally
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:44.120]  like
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:49.480]  We've wept so far ahead here that no you can't do I'm sure no individual could do it
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:51.780]  But if you bring it into your Apple Watch shop
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:56.320]  They they'll be happy to do it for 500 bucks or whatever
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:03.040]  Yeah, and it maybe it won't even maybe it won't be offered on the sport edition, you know
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:06.600]  Maybe it's only something for the the stainless steel and gold one
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:10.900]  Because why if it say it cost $500 to upgrade?
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:16.960]  Or well, that's probably too much because if the starting price of the watch is 349 you should you know?
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:20.980]  Well, let's so let's call it 250. Yeah, just to pick a number. That's that's not
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:25.440]  Painless, it's not pocket change, but it's reasonable if you have a
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:27.340]  350 dollar
[01:38:27.340 --> 01:38:29.340]  Apple watch you're not gonna pay
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:34.320]  250 to get the s1 replaced with an s2 or an s3
[01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:37.520]  When you could just spend 350 again and get a brand new one
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:42.160]  Which might actually be a little slimmer and smaller and have an updated industrial design
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:46.680]  But if you spent 10 grand on an apple at Apple Watch Edition
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:49.280]  And it's solid gold
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.720]  and
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:58.680]  It still looks great physically on the outside because it's unscratched because this display is sapphire and the gold is special hardened gold
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:02.800]  You've already spent 10 grand on it
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:08.000]  Would you spend 250 to get to make it faster and have the battery last longer and probably you know?
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.720]  And again, I'm guessing as part of the service, they'll just put a new battery module in
[01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:17.280]  You know because yours has already been through 700, you know recharge cycles
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:24.240]  And that's again in this weird way that they are even though it's truly a computer
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:29.080]  They're really only comparing it to the existing high-end watch world
[01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:34.400]  There is no they never use the word smartwatch never showed anybody else's they're just acting as though
[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:39.880]  Android wear and the stuff Samsung's doing that they're just acting as though that stuff doesn't even exist
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:47.360]  But in the real, you know high-end luxury watch world when you buy a $10,000 watch or a $5,000 watch
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:52.200]  You do you do get it serviced every few years because as a mechanical device it needs it needs
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:56.560]  You know expert attention every couple of years just to keep it in perfect working order
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:00.360]  It's expected, you know, and it's not free
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:05.880]  You don't you don't you know, you don't get free service on your your Rolex or Omega or whatever brand watch you have
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:07.880]  But you know if you've already
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:13.640]  Bought bought it for 10 grand and you want it to last a long time a $200 service is you know something?
[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:15.640]  You don't even bat an eyelash yet
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:18.640]  And what's so what's so interesting about this idea?
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:24.920]  So they had they speaking of accidental accidental tech podcast they discussed it at the beginning of this of this and I think
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:29.040]  All of them whose opinions I respect greatly were were
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:33.720]  Dismissive of the idea. I think John Syracusa put it as being a nerd fantasy
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:38.000]  Which which in in some it is he's right. No, it is in a wake
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.800]  It's like it's a you know, I think the comparison that he would make would be like the x-mac, right?
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:47.600]  Oh, I can't Apple make a desktop computer where I can change the parts and stuff like that, but I I think
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:55.480]  The reason why I I'm I find this so compelling it'd be very clear like
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.440]  All the available information that we have suggests that this isn't possible
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:06.520]  right that if you are actually making something so small and you want to maximize battery life like the last thing you want to
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:12.000]  Do is is make any considerations towards towards modularity that said?
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:19.480]  If you could do this so much about this product comes into queer focus
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:26.520]  Right, the the the gold edition the idea that they're being like imagine a mad just imagine
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:30.800]  Let's play with this. Let's assume it's possible. Imagine in ten years, right?
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:35.120]  Oh, you have a first edition, right and it's not a first edition
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:38.360]  Like I have the first iPod where it's nice that it sits on my desk
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:42.920]  There's no way in the world actually use it but you have a first edition and you're still wearing it like oh
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:46.400]  You got one of those back in the day. I got so I have a my I have one Swiss watch
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:51.440]  it's a it's a wedding present from my in-laws like a very traditional sort of wedding present and
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:57.640]  It's a it's a Mont Blanc it's so they make pens, right but they got they used to make watches like in the 1800s
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:59.440]  And then they stopped and they got back into watches
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:02.440]  I like the first one they made when they came back and like I
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:07.400]  Feel very proud of that fact that I have like their first one when they came back on the market
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:17.480]  Imagine imagine if if that was a selling point for for this watch or there was different editions and different designs
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:26.680]  And the the value of of of the fashion the value of the design if you know, it's timeless
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:29.720]  Used not making a pun there
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:35.200]  But if you know like it's it's something that is not a throwaway object that just completely
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:40.280]  Tilts the table when it comes to the importance of fashion the importance of design the importance of all this
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:48.040]  Untangible stuff that Apple specializes in and it's so it's like flipping the old PC market on its head
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:52.720]  The way Apple was hurt before is because they couldn't keep up on all the component parts
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:57.880]  But now if they were really so far ahead it actually accentuates their biggest strengths
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:00.880]  Yeah, I totally agree
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.480]  And before we move on I will say I I know from
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:11.760]  Corrections from what I've speculated on Android wear that Android wear devices. They do have gigabytes of local storage
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:17.200]  They do have a full app SDK for running standalone apps, but there aren't many apps yet
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:19.200]  But I guess they're they're coming soon
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:26.040]  And I think it therefore can can at least if not today is already as planned
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:30.160]  You know without any kind of oh now we're gonna start doing more stuff like Apple like Apple
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:35.640]  Like things like playback of podcasts over Bluetooth or something like that
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:37.480]  It seems like it's already planned for that
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:38.800]  But it it to me though
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:45.960]  I I'm just guessing though that if you run any kind of like a benchmark or spec on an Android wear device today versus this
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:50.880]  The first Apple watch that we see next year it I think we're gonna be blown away by the difference in
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:54.720]  Computing performance that they've put into the watch. No in this I think this is really
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:44:00.080]  This is this is key cuz like remember Steve Jobs said the iPhone is five years ahead of the competition
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:04.560]  And it turned out it actually was five years out of the competition. It was around 2012 that
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:08.760]  That Android, you know really caught up
[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:14.840]  I mean, obviously you and I certainly feel that from an experience standpoint the iPhone is still ahead from an app standpoint
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:21.120]  I would I would say they are as far as quality of apps, but from a you know, I think it's a really good idea
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:26.120]  They are as far as quality of apps, but from a you know, are they in the same bulb?
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:32.600]  Right, exactly exactly and it took about five years. Yeah, and I think I think there's no I think the
[01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:38.320]  The s1 apart like right now. It's arguable that Apple's greatest strength right now is is chip design
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:42.680]  Which is yes pretty amazing and and the s1 is is right in their wheelhouse
[01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:46.920]  And this is the actually there's one other point that I'd well that I think is really interesting
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:48.920]  it goes back to Ben Gate actually a
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:53.800]  Lot of people are saying about the iPhone. They said it before even been gay to happen
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:56.960]  like why can't they make it just a little bit thicker and give us more battery life and
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:01.560]  And or back to the IMAX. Why are the IMAX, you know, why are they making them so thin?
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:03.560]  like it's sitting on your desk and
[01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:06.820]  John, Syracuse, oh who
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:12.400]  We love everyone our listeners all love but his maybe his all-time favorite article that he's written
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:17.860]  Is something like don't stop thinking about tomorrow or something along those lines. Basically, he says that
[01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:20.740]  When we look when we look back
[01:45:20.740 --> 01:45:26.700]  It seems like there's these these breaks right where we made these big leaps like we left to the iPhone all this sort of
[01:45:26.700 --> 01:45:27.620]  stuff and he's like
[01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:33.500]  But those leaps don't happen by chance like they happen because there's just constant
[01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:40.020]  constant pushing constant iteration constantly figuring things out and what I think is really compelling about the watch is
[01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:47.700]  The reason if Apple has well Apple's clearly done something very impressive in technical perspective
[01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:51.820]  If they've even gotten done even more than seems possible and done this sort of modular sort of approach
[01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:55.660]  Like the reason they can pull this off is because they've been making phones so thin
[01:45:55.660 --> 01:45:57.380]  it's because they've been they
[01:45:57.380 --> 01:46:02.240]  and what I mean by that is they've been pushing the envelope on things like thinness and on things like
[01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:05.140]  efficiency and on things like battery life and and
[01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:12.620]  All that pays off when they're they're capable of making something like the watch
[01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:14.620]  that
[01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:17.540]  Is already way smaller than anything else on the market?
[01:46:18.100 --> 01:46:22.560]  We don't know the battery life, but I I have to assume that Apple will
[01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:28.580]  You they want to make sure it lasts a full day before before they they say anything
[01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:32.580]  But that's that's the net result of all this stuff. That doesn't happen by accident
[01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:36.540]  Right, and I think that it's it's tough for
[01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:45.300]  a lot of people in the tech world that that tech focus mentality to wrap their heads around this because they've always thought that they
[01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:47.420]  Still think of Apple as a company that doesn't value
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:50.720]  performance as a top priority
[01:46:51.780 --> 01:46:56.820]  That they you know, they're a design company and then you know max you do you don't get a lot of bang for your buck
[01:46:57.660 --> 01:47:01.380]  Performance wise with a Mac which hasn't really been true for years
[01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:05.220]  But put that aside though that people just underestimate that
[01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:10.540]  I just don't think that they they get their heads around this about like you said like just how much Apple as a
[01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:13.540]  semiconductor company is leading the industry in
[01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:18.720]  Terms of that where they're interested making things smaller and more efficient
[01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:25.300]  And I thought it was so telling that when a non tech ran their initial benchmarks of the new iPhones
[01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:31.420]  That in most of the benchmarks the iPhone 5s is still top 5 sometimes 3rd
[01:47:31.900 --> 01:47:38.780]  Just only behind the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus a year later, you know in a very competitive industry
[01:47:38.780 --> 01:47:43.920]  I mean arguably the most competitive industry in all of tech with everybody, you know
[01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:47.340]  You know clawing at each other
[01:47:48.020 --> 01:47:49.300]  and
[01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:57.180]  considering that the other guys are the ones who who more directly address the spec driven market and that they still don't have phones that
[01:47:57.180 --> 01:48:00.700]  Compete with the iPhone 5s or that surpass it at least
[01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:03.380]  I
[01:48:03.380 --> 01:48:07.380]  Think that's so super telling about how just how potentially
[01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:14.500]  remarkable the s1 could be and who knows maybe we're making fools of ourselves and that the specs of the s of the Apple watch
[01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:21.220]  Technically aren't gonna be that remarkable compared to Apple or Android wear and other things, you know, who knows maybe you know
[01:48:21.220 --> 01:48:24.940]  We're completely wasting our time and and fantasizing about this
[01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:28.160]  But I can't help but think that they would not draw attention to it
[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:32.720]  If it weren't something they were super proud of what not in that not just that but this is this is like
[01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:36.900]  This is this should be the gating factor on where they should wait or not
[01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:43.940]  Because to want something that is that is underpowered that does not enable a platform
[01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:46.340]  would would be a mistake because you
[01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:51.860]  You once you if you start out with and this is this is what I've got
[01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:57.620]  This is what I so clearly got wrong and where why I like I almost felt an urgency to correct myself is
[01:48:57.940 --> 01:49:05.740]  If you start out with just the mental model that this is an accessory like the iPod was an accessory
[01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:07.740]  you
[01:49:07.820 --> 01:49:09.420]  You're making
[01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:16.060]  fundamental you're putting fundamental constraints on the product that that will determine the product's
[01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:19.700]  Trajectory in the long run, right? It's like Windows 8 right Windows 8
[01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:26.340]  Couldn't fully break away from being a desktop keyboard mouse and driven sort of thing
[01:49:26.340 --> 01:49:33.380]  And that's just that it's handicapped everything else and it's an extreme example. But if you can't just flip a switch and say oh
[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:35.380]  software developer
[01:49:35.860 --> 01:49:42.180]  You designed an app for the watch assuming the phone would be there but now it's not there like there's
[01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:48.260]  That's very hard to overcome and that's gonna be a challenge for Android where like Android where is very explicit right now
[01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:50.260]  You have to have an accompanying
[01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:54.260]  smartphone app and and
[01:49:54.780 --> 01:49:58.780]  That's only possible if the s1 is actually a real computer like that's only possible
[01:49:58.780 --> 01:50:04.580]  And so I presume it is I think the modularity if you can replace it is definitely an open question
[01:50:04.580 --> 01:50:10.220]  But man, it would be unbelievably compelling if it was replaced. Yeah, it's too I guess it's two different issues
[01:50:10.220 --> 01:50:16.500]  There's the first is just how much is this really a technically impressive computer. I think that's a sure thing
[01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:22.940]  I I would I'm gonna eat my hat if it's not a blowaway technical device at a computer engineering level
[01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:28.860]  Is the the idea that a year later or two years later you could take it into the Apple Store and?
[01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:34.300]  Get it replaced with an upgraded version it that might be just pure fantasy on my part
[01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:37.660]  Even if the the gold ones do cost five six seven ten thousand dollars
[01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:43.980]  Even if they do it really might be the case that you you know, you've okay
[01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:45.300]  Thanks for your five thousand dollars
[01:50:45.300 --> 01:50:48.420]  But two years from now you're gonna need to spend another five thousand to get a better one
[01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:51.740]  It might be I would you know, I don't think that's out of hand
[01:50:51.740 --> 01:50:56.420]  But I do think though it's way more compelling if if it's not
[01:50:57.500 --> 01:51:00.260]  Let me do the third sponsor and it would remind me
[01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:04.220]  I'm gonna here's the topic that I want to come back to after this is
[01:51:04.540 --> 01:51:09.140]  If it is modular in terms of being replaceable would Apple tell us that?
[01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:12.060]  in January
[01:51:12.100 --> 01:51:15.380]  Or would they wait a year before they say that?
[01:51:15.780 --> 01:51:18.300]  So think about that think about that and we'll come back to it
[01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:24.500]  But right now let's thank our third and final sponsor of the show another new sponsor really really happy to have
[01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:27.540]  these guys here it is
[01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:36.100]  Need and EED need is a refined retailer and lifestyle magazine from men
[01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:44.060]  Each month need curates and sells a limited quantity of exclusive products from the world's top men's brand
[01:51:44.060 --> 01:51:50.060]  These are collections. They're presented in the form of like a monthly editorial built around a certain theme
[01:51:51.020 --> 01:51:55.820]  And they're shot with beautiful photography by local independent photographers
[01:51:56.980 --> 01:51:59.780]  So stuff like clothing you want to stay up-to-date when it looks stylish
[01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:04.540]  You want to stay up-to-date on men's fashion? These guys will help you, but it goes beyond that. It's not just clothing
[01:52:04.540 --> 01:52:07.700]  They also sell coffee. They sell literature furniture
[01:52:08.660 --> 01:52:12.860]  And so forth just about anything you might be interested in anything where design matters
[01:52:12.860 --> 01:52:15.220]  Need has issues
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:18.460]  surrounding those things
[01:52:18.460 --> 01:52:22.780]  Soon they're gonna localize to certain cities around the world. The first of which is going to be London
[01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:28.600]  So that'll be of keen interest to all of you guys who you know, the listeners over in the UK
[01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:35.740]  They just launched need volume 8 assembly. That's the theme and it features some of the best products
[01:52:37.660 --> 01:52:39.340]  For evenings
[01:52:39.340 --> 01:52:45.740]  With friends hosting parties that sort of thing assembly in terms of you know, assembling you and your friends and family together
[01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:52.280]  They've got favorites like the Stewart throw schwood sunglasses
[01:52:52.900 --> 01:52:57.540]  And the classic Oxford watch which is a really cool classic watch
[01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:01.680]  Here's where you go to find out more their website is need
[01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:09.720]  Addition dot-com that's addition like the addition edition of a magazine need edition
[01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:16.760]  dot-com and they have a special offer for talk show listeners anyone who places an order with need
[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:24.080]  And when you're sent from the show go there order and then send an email to hello at need addition calm
[01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:29.800]  Hello at need addition calm with the subject line. This is the code no spoilers and
[01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:37.200]  Then after you've you place the order then you just shoot them an email and send them that code word in the subject

[01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:05.160]  With no spoilers as the subject sort of a low low-tech
[01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:08.120]  hand delivered
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:14.760]  Product code just for listeners of the show so my thanks to them really great stuff really impressive
[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:20.920]  Design and curation really these guys find stuff that I've never heard of and it's it's really really cool stuff
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:25.160]  Absolutely, positively worth your attention and trying this out. So my thanks to need
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:29.040]  All right. I told you to remember what I what did I want to ask you?
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:36.800]  If if when they introduce if it is mod if it's modular, will they say so right? Will they tell us? Absolutely
[01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:43.200]  Absolutely. I mean like I said, if it's modular it changes the entire perception and
[01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:47.040]  Conceptualization of what this of what this is
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:50.320]  Right, it goes it changes from being another
[01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:56.320]  Very pretty and and cool yet disposable item to being
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:01.360]  Like something meaningful right the way the whale watch is meaningful
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:04.560]  like a high a high-end watch is meaningful and
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:10.480]  No, I I think it would be I think it's difficult to overstate
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:18.880]  what a difference that would make in the way people think about the entire the entire category in the entire watch and that
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:20.880]  by the way, that would
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:26.160]  I mean that would just pull the rug out from all the Android wear devices and just a you know, pretty
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:34.880]  Unbelievable way. I mean it would very clearly Apple would be setting themselves up as we are the Swiss but with a
[01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:43.360]  Relatively, we're swatch all the way up to Cartier. Yeah. Um, right and you guys you can have you know
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:46.960]  you're the Casio's of the market or stuff like that and
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:52.400]  No, I of course that that would be a central a key point in my opinion
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:55.200]  Yeah, I I think so too
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:56:00.480]  The only reason I could think that they wouldn't is if they're unsure if it's like that's their hope and that's their plan
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:02.480]  But they don't want to put it on the market
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:06.160]  That's their hope and that's their plan, but they don't want to promise it in advance
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:11.280]  Because what if something comes up and went the way that they want to make the s2 it's not
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:14.240]  socket compatible
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:15.920]  with you know
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:17.520]  with the s
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:21.920]  Yeah, well, I I think the s I don't know the s2 is already on the drawing board
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:23.760]  at least
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:30.160]  um, and and not just that but the the it's the first edition that's going to have the biggest battery life challenges that's going to have
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:33.360]  all these sort of things and it like for example if
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:39.200]  To to make something modular even if it has to be done by a technician right to make anything modular
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:42.880]  You're making some sort of trade-off in space in particular
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:50.960]  Space is the biggest one by far and that is such a massive constraint right now that if they're willing to make that trade-off in
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:52.160]  version one
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:56.640]  They're they're only gonna make that trade-off if if they're if they're not gonna do that for optionality
[01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:01.120]  They're gonna do it because the right payoff there and ways that it would work
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:04.080]  If you just think wow, it just sounds so crazy
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:07.360]  It just sounds so crazy because Apple's the company that famously got scorched
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:13.040]  Like you said for not having a replaceable battery user replaceable battery, but you can replace your battery
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:18.000]  I'll just point out you've always been able to replace your battery in your phone by taking it into Apple and having a you know
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:23.840]  It's just that you can't pop off the back yourself and put a replacement in it's not user swappable throughout the day
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:30.160]  Yeah, but it is, you know, certainly modular in terms of if your battery is if you got a bad battery or an old battery
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:32.000]  You can go in and get a new one
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:39.160]  But the way that things evolved the way computers does evolve certainly personal computers is they get smaller and more efficient
[01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:43.920]  So as the s1 gets smaller and more or you know
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:49.200]  The s-series gets smaller and more efficient over the years. There's always going to be room in your original
[01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:54.900]  2015 Apple watch for the new smaller s right exactly exactly because like the
[01:57:55.060 --> 01:57:59.220]  Future like the next version of the physical hardware could be smaller
[01:57:59.220 --> 01:58:05.060]  And that's not a problem for the original because the ridge if you presume that right this will be the biggest the it ever is
[01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:08.300]  Right is a which is an exceptionally reasonable
[01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:10.780]  position to take
[01:58:10.780 --> 01:58:12.620]  Certainly the thickest it's ever going right
[01:58:12.620 --> 01:58:16.580]  I mean cuz I'd like like, you know, it's certainly one of the knocks against it from a watch
[01:58:16.580 --> 01:58:21.100]  person's perspective specifically called out by Ben climber of the dinky that
[01:58:21.220 --> 01:58:25.180]  It does sit a little high on your wrist and therefore, you know that the issue with a watch
[01:58:25.180 --> 01:58:29.260]  That's physically thick is it's you know, your your shirt sleeves might get caught on it
[01:58:30.900 --> 01:58:36.300]  And it would leave room if I'm correct to that if there is a swappable strategy
[01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:42.020]  You know an upgradeable strategy that they're gonna do the battery along with the s1 because batteries, you know
[01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:49.580]  to deteriorate over time and they're expressly one of the few things they're telling us already is that you will need to charge it every
[01:58:49.580 --> 01:58:51.580]  day so it's going to go through a lot of
[01:58:52.220 --> 01:58:58.480]  You know if you use and like your Apple watch you're gonna go through close to 365 upgrade
[01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:01.560]  You know battery cycles a year that they'll do that too
[01:59:01.560 --> 01:59:06.940]  But then that if the s1 shrinks a little every year then there they can make the battery a little bigger
[01:59:06.940 --> 01:59:08.940]  We're not just that but battery technology
[01:59:08.940 --> 01:59:12.780]  Unfortunately, not fast enough, but it does improve, you know, right regularly
[01:59:13.380 --> 01:59:16.340]  Right, the other thing just a side note. I think
[01:59:17.700 --> 01:59:22.260]  one of the other things that changed my mind about the iWatch that needs to be more not less is
[01:59:24.300 --> 01:59:29.580]  The reason we like an iPhone was was terrible at battery life compared to what was on the market
[01:59:30.340 --> 01:59:31.740]  in it
[01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:37.380]  But we put up with like it was people couldn't believe are you gonna really charge your phone every night?
[01:59:37.380 --> 01:59:44.060]  But yeah, people did it because it was so much better and I think that's another reason to presume that
[01:59:44.460 --> 01:59:46.300]  Apple is
[01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:50.420]  Wants the watch to do so much more that it's so compelling
[01:59:50.820 --> 01:59:52.820]  That you will put up with
[01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:57.620]  Charging the way to overcome charging every night is to not to make a watch that lasts for two weeks because that's impossible
[01:59:58.100 --> 02:00:01.340]  The way to overcome it is to make it worth the trouble
[02:00:02.140 --> 02:00:05.900]  Right of bringing an extra adapter and right it you know
[02:00:05.900 --> 02:00:12.100]  So what do you think the retail experience? I mean, especially if there's changing batteries and or changing processors
[02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:18.180]  Well, I think it starts let's take another step back and hit on another topic from ATP recently
[02:00:18.180 --> 02:00:20.180]  Which was wait a minute, isn't this?
[02:00:22.100 --> 02:00:28.180]  On Apple like like the Apple and and you know, it was one of Marco's lines and but I've seen this all across the web that
[02:00:29.100 --> 02:00:31.100]  the the
[02:00:31.100 --> 02:00:38.340]  The the what we think of is the Apple way to do it is to make one Apple watch the first year and
[02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:42.420]  It would be compelling to everybody men and women
[02:00:42.820 --> 02:00:48.980]  It would be let's you know, let's just split the middle instead of 42 and 38 millimeter. Let's call it 40 millimeter
[02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:52.660]  Appealing to men and women
[02:00:53.100 --> 02:00:56.060]  possibly even one color and one type of band and
[02:00:56.060 --> 02:01:02.700]  and that's it and then maybe over years it would maybe the product line would grow and that is you know,
[02:01:02.700 --> 02:01:06.020]  and it would be you know, an aluminum and glass type thing that sells for
[02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:08.580]  350 bucks a price that
[02:01:08.940 --> 02:01:11.340]  all existing Apple customers can afford
[02:01:12.820 --> 02:01:14.820]  That this idea of selling
[02:01:14.980 --> 02:01:21.620]  What I think are gonna be fifteen hundred dollar two thousand dollar stainless steel ones and five thousand ten thousand dollar gold ones
[02:01:21.620 --> 02:01:26.780]  All of it coming out at once doesn't that mean that Apple as we know it is over and it's it's you know
[02:01:27.220 --> 02:01:29.140]  Whether it's for better or for worse. It's different
[02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:33.980]  Or it doesn't even make sense and because you know what that's funny thing, too
[02:01:33.980 --> 02:01:37.140]  Is I don't know how many people who listen to the show are gonna disagree with us
[02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:42.340]  But at least on Twitter when I wrote my piece, you know week and a half ago two weeks ago, man
[02:01:42.340 --> 02:01:45.140]  I mean a lot of people like wow, that was really insightful. You really opened my eyes
[02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:48.660]  I think you're on to something here and then there was an awful lot of vitriol
[02:01:48.660 --> 02:01:52.540]  I got more negative feedback on that piece than
[02:01:53.460 --> 02:01:58.260]  Anything that I've written in a long time and these are this is from people who I think usually
[02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:01.500]  Agree with or like what I have to say about Apple
[02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:04.940]  But there are I mean there were people who are saying things like if the gold one
[02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:08.140]  even cost twice the the
[02:02:08.860 --> 02:02:10.860]  You know three hundred fifty dollars that
[02:02:11.460 --> 02:02:13.460]  That you know, they're gonna lose their shit
[02:02:13.460 --> 02:02:19.660]  It it's and I don't think people get I don't think what I don't think people get is just how different this is
[02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:27.020]  From anything Apple's done before it's not right at you're doing yourself a disservice if you're thinking about it in the context of how
[02:02:27.020 --> 02:02:30.860]  Apple has done things in the I completely agree like it. What's interesting about
[02:02:32.580 --> 02:02:35.660]  It's funny I mentioned that my criticism critical of the watch piece
[02:02:36.460 --> 02:02:40.060]  Was both very popular is widely shared like hundreds and hundreds of tweets
[02:02:40.060 --> 02:02:45.100]  My my recent piece the one that you linked. Well, let's use that one as an example
[02:02:45.100 --> 02:02:48.620]  Like you've linked to several my pieces in the past. Usually they are both
[02:02:49.140 --> 02:02:52.420]  You know, they get a lot of views and they're also shared a lot on Twitter
[02:02:52.420 --> 02:02:57.100]  my one this week has gotten a lot of views, but it's it's hardly gotten shared on Twitter at all and
[02:02:57.620 --> 02:03:03.180]  What's interesting is I think it's it's it's actually of a piece with the pricing thing and what I mean by that is I?
[02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:06.300]  I think and I'm I think it's why it's been so hard to articulate
[02:03:06.300 --> 02:03:12.220]  I think what Apple's had a hard time articulating. Is that if if we are right that Apple is
[02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:15.580]  Like Apple is going for this
[02:03:16.900 --> 02:03:20.940]  Future that is just wildly more ambitious than anyone
[02:03:20.940 --> 02:03:24.140]  I think was originally thinking about and that might be from a price perspective
[02:03:24.140 --> 02:03:29.260]  It might be from a style perspective might be from performance perspective might be from a West perspective
[02:03:30.700 --> 02:03:34.940]  It's it's almost like people are going to be thinking about it
[02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:41.900]  it's almost like people like yeah, it just doesn't fit with anyone's model of the way things ought to be and I think a lot of
[02:03:41.900 --> 02:03:43.060]  people
[02:03:43.060 --> 02:03:44.980]  just and
[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:49.620]  Some people is very strongly disagree. I've definitely heard from them, but they a lot of people just they're not
[02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:51.620]  They don't know what to think. It's just like
[02:03:52.380 --> 02:03:53.660]  What?
[02:03:53.660 --> 02:03:56.860]  It just I don't know what to think like what's what's going on here?
[02:03:56.860 --> 02:04:01.380]  I think the price thing is is very much of a piece with that. I mean the idea that
[02:04:01.380 --> 02:04:04.220]  Apple would sell a
[02:04:05.660 --> 02:04:13.220]  From a tech person perspective an identical device for ten times or more the price of another identical device
[02:04:13.220 --> 02:04:15.220]  Just does not compute
[02:04:15.300 --> 02:04:19.900]  right in a way that like and go back to the car analogy that you know, like you
[02:04:20.420 --> 02:04:22.500]  Casey made the point of Marco that hey, you've got a
[02:04:23.300 --> 02:04:25.300]  BMW m5
[02:04:25.300 --> 02:04:31.620]  You know that costs triple what even a regular, you know, nice car
[02:04:32.380 --> 02:04:37.500]  Costs and you're still bound by the same speed limits and even if you want to disobey the speed limits
[02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:39.500]  You can't go that much faster, you know
[02:04:39.780 --> 02:04:42.500]  Then then the speed limit and you know
[02:04:43.220 --> 02:04:46.500]  Maintain any kind of you know, reasonable safety Marco
[02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:52.220]  I believe does not do any kind of recreational auto racing, you know, which some people do some people do, you know
[02:04:52.220 --> 02:04:55.460]  To go on test tracks and stuff like that, you
[02:04:56.240 --> 02:05:00.700]  know it's but it still is a better car technically than
[02:05:01.880 --> 02:05:07.840]  You know thirty thousand dollar Acura or something right? It's you know, technically engineering wise. It's a better car
[02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:14.680]  Whereas the computer inside the Apple watch edition is I believe going to be the exact same
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:17.680]  Computer in the Apple watch sport. Yep
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:24.720]  No in and it it goes back full circle because what Apple is selling now and they've always sold this
[02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:28.720]  But it's always been it's always been the frosting on the cake, right?
[02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:33.200]  But now like it is the cake what they're selling is they're selling the intangibles
[02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:41.720]  They're selling there's like gold the idea of gold being more valuable is is a pure human construct
[02:05:42.080 --> 02:05:44.840]  Right. There's nothing like right gold doesn't
[02:05:44.840 --> 02:05:47.500]  Really have any innate
[02:05:48.280 --> 02:05:54.120]  Applications that meet that the reason gold is more valuable is because we as a human race have decided that gold is more valuable
[02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.680]  It's complete its value is almost completely intangible
[02:05:58.400 --> 02:06:03.600]  Right when you're in a museum and you see like an old very old like a sword or a weapon
[02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:10.120]  That's made or crafted partly out of gold. That's it's certainly not because gold made for a stronger so we have a weaker sword
[02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:14.000]  You know, yeah, right. It's you're almost if you know, it's a showpiece
[02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.100]  It's effectively useless in a real combat
[02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:20.440]  But it's you know, it it signifies something else entirely
[02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:27.360]  This is I I feel like this this in particular and you nailed it by saying it's it's gonna be culture shock. This is just
[02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:32.040]  Completely anathema to the traditional tech
[02:06:32.860 --> 02:06:36.600]  mindset and and and and the geek mindset that I think is very
[02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:39.640]  You know is very focused on
[02:06:39.640 --> 02:06:47.080]  Efficiency that's very folk in efficiency in all means not just efficiency in computing but efficiency in using money
[02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:49.280]  efficiency and how you live your life
[02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:55.120]  Like I want to have a hack where I can I can get this experience for a tenth of the price than I should
[02:06:55.120 --> 02:07:01.640]  Otherwise, there's something on those lines like Apple like a gold edition watch is the exact opposite direction
[02:07:01.640 --> 02:07:07.880]  It's more expensive for the sake of being expensive and I don't mean that in a people have made the analogy that I am rich app
[02:07:07.880 --> 02:07:12.480]  um, no, it's it's not it's not that because you the the
[02:07:12.920 --> 02:07:15.720]  benefit accruing to the person using that is
[02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:20.960]  At a very superficial level. I suppose I can see the analogy but it's again
[02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:27.280]  I think the the the class here has to be the luxury the luxury goods market where
[02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:30.240]  the reality is the rally is
[02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:34.480]  most luxury items are less functional than
[02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:37.160]  Than the cheaper alternatives
[02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:41.520]  but and famously in the watch world the famously the
[02:07:42.360 --> 02:07:48.360]  Quartz watch a $20 quartz timex keeps better time than a $20,000
[02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:51.960]  Oh, yeah, my watch is is terrible. Like it's always off
[02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:54.640]  and
[02:07:54.640 --> 02:07:56.640]  but just because
[02:07:56.760 --> 02:08:04.440]  Just because it's not tangible doesn't mean it's not real and and what I mean and it's not real and it's not real in
[02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:05.480]  a like
[02:08:05.480 --> 02:08:11.720]  marketing artificial sense like it's people actually care about this and they've cared about it for it for
[02:08:12.720 --> 02:08:19.080]  Thousands millions of years like this isn't a fluke that people value that people value by
[02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:22.160]  I'm being very expressive right now
[02:08:22.160 --> 02:08:25.880]  My wife just looked in the window because I look out on the porch and I just totally lost my train of thought
[02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:28.800]  but
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:30.240]  It's very
[02:08:30.240 --> 02:08:33.880]  People care about this stuff in a very real way. They've cared about for millions of years
[02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:38.520]  It's not a fluke and what Apple's tapping into is is a real thing
[02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:43.960]  I think and I'm trying to think about the other eyes and teas. I want to cross here
[02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:48.360]  one of the things I want to talk about and just sort of pure tangent but Wi-Fi they
[02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:55.280]  Apple watch does have some sort of Wi-Fi, but they call it Apple calls it that it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
[02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:59.600]  I'm not quoting here, but it's to stay in touch with your iPhone
[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:05.200]  So I think what they're saying and I asked and could not get a an actual straight answer
[02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:10.480]  But the insinuation was that it's like the back-channel Wi-Fi whatever you want to call it ad hoc Wi-Fi
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:15.440]  where it uses Wi-Fi like the way that you can do things now like
[02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:18.800]  Pairing a keyboard with you know
[02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:22.580]  Your Apple TV and stuff that you can do these things without getting it on the network first
[02:09:22.580 --> 02:09:30.300]  Or the way airdrop works right that you can airdrop things to people over Wi-Fi without being on the same Wi-Fi network
[02:09:30.300 --> 02:09:33.780]  Right now go the negotiation happens over Bluetooth, but then it uses Wi-Fi
[02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:34.100]  Yeah
[02:09:34.100 --> 02:09:41.020]  I think that's the Wi-Fi that it has like it's not that you could go out without your phone
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:47.020]  Go to Starbucks and get on Wi-Fi and have iMessages show up and get your email to show up
[02:09:47.020 --> 02:09:51.540]  I don't think but they didn't there they haven't expressly ruled that out
[02:09:51.540 --> 02:09:55.360]  So I have to we have to file it in the big pile of I don't knows
[02:09:55.620 --> 02:09:59.180]  But the strong hint that I got was that it doesn't have like true
[02:09:59.660 --> 02:10:05.100]  Independent Wi-Fi like go get on a Wi-Fi network without outside tethering range to your iPhone
[02:10:05.140 --> 02:10:12.460]  It's a way to use Wi-Fi to extend the tethering range to your iPhone. Yeah, I believe which which makes sense. I mean if if
[02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:19.980]  That that sounds really like a user interface disaster to have to like join random Wi-Fi networks
[02:10:19.980 --> 02:10:24.260]  and if like it's almost like simpler to just say
[02:10:24.780 --> 02:10:26.780]  It works with your iPhone
[02:10:26.820 --> 02:10:32.780]  And then once once you can do it all do it all right. It's like right resolution independence, right?
[02:10:32.780 --> 02:10:38.020]  I do think though that that's how the product will evolve though is that before it gets cellular?
[02:10:38.020 --> 02:10:41.100]  It would I mean it absolutely makes sense to have Wi-Fi first
[02:10:41.100 --> 02:10:48.760]  It's consumes, you know less battery just like the way the iPod touch as a Wi-Fi only device has always been thinner than the iPhone
[02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:54.420]  It still is even today the two-year-old iPod touch design is thinner than even the iPhone 6
[02:10:55.800 --> 02:10:59.360]  Because it's you know there's less stuff you have to put in there to just do Wi-Fi
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:06.320]  So I think it would make sense for a future version of Apple watch to have I don't know what to call it real Wi-Fi
[02:11:06.520 --> 02:11:12.640]  Support where you can use it as an independent device anywhere you have Wi-Fi before it even gets cellular networking
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:16.080]  But I don't think it's gonna be there this year. That's interesting, but it would be a nice surprise
[02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:20.560]  It would be a nice surprise if maybe maybe that maybe they're waiting to see what where they can get battery life, too
[02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:28.080]  Like if if the battery life ends up being sufficient to enable it they will and if it if like that's a that's a big
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:31.120]  Potential area if they're like what they just can't get the battery to be good enough
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:37.920]  Well, we'll cut this and then that gives us an extra hour or two hours. Yeah a repeated strain of criticism of my
[02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:40.360]  assumption I
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:47.480]  Bank on it that 349 means Apple sport, and it's aluminum and what they call it. What are they called ion X glass?
[02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:53.440]  It's a glass display and an aluminum case so in other words. It's like iPod
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:56.120]  iPhone build quality and materials
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:12:02.640]  That's 349 stainless steel is going to be more expensive because the stainless steel just plain Apple watch is
[02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:06.680]  In addition to being stainless steel. It's sapphire display
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:12.920]  And stainless steel is not that expensive a material, but it's you know
[02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:15.760]  If you look at what stainless steel high-end watches cost that cost
[02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:19.880]  You know four digits not three digits usually or and if they do cost three digits
[02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:23.560]  They're lesser brands and they're close to a thousand dollars
[02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:28.640]  And the gold one I'm telling you is gonna be a lot of money, but a lot of people said well
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:35.180]  No, no, no, I you know Apple watch is the one that just is called Apple watch. That's the one that's got to be
[02:12:35.180 --> 02:12:41.180]  349 because it's just called Apple watch Apple sport must be a little bit more expensive or something like it's
[02:12:41.180 --> 02:12:45.500]  Optimized for working out or something like that and it's made of aluminum to be lighter weight
[02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:47.580]  and
[02:12:47.580 --> 02:12:51.620]  That only the gold one's gonna be more expensive and that if you look at the way they put them on the page
[02:12:51.620 --> 02:12:58.180]  They put Apple watch first then Apple sport or Apple watch sport and then Apple watch edition
[02:12:58.500 --> 02:13:00.660]  What sense would it make to arrange them like that?
[02:13:00.660 --> 02:13:07.180]  I I think these people are just the people who think that or just you're just looking at this all wrong
[02:13:07.180 --> 02:13:14.140]  I don't think it's a coincidence that Apple watch the stainless steel one, which I think is probably gonna cost like maybe like $9.99
[02:13:14.940 --> 02:13:17.740]  I don't think it's a coincidence at its first
[02:13:17.740 --> 02:13:21.860]  I think Apple might honestly think it might be the best-selling one
[02:13:22.020 --> 02:13:27.500]  That the low-end one may not be the the best-selling in the same way that the iPhone 5c
[02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:29.780]  Did not outsell the 5s last year
[02:13:30.380 --> 02:13:35.300]  It's it. No, that's that's a that's a great analogy to the to the S and C and I think
[02:13:36.140 --> 02:13:42.660]  The which one sells more will come back to the modularity question. I know that would certainly change
[02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:45.380]  The product that I would buy
[02:13:46.460 --> 02:13:53.540]  You know, but just because I as much as I like to talk about the these intangible aspects and things about about Apple
[02:13:53.540 --> 02:13:58.580]  I'm enough of a geek that I'm not gonna I'm not gonna spend a few thousand dollars on a device
[02:13:58.580 --> 02:14:00.580]  That's going to be obsolete in two years
[02:14:01.140 --> 02:14:02.420]  Yeah, I you know
[02:14:02.420 --> 02:14:07.220]  but I definitely think though that people are just there they just cannot wrap their heads around the fact that the
[02:14:07.420 --> 02:14:11.100]  Default model is not going to be the low-end not and it's again
[02:14:11.100 --> 02:14:15.660]  I think the phone is the way to look at that the default iPhone the one that they expect most people to buy
[02:14:15.860 --> 02:14:19.420]  Is the iPhone 6 no for sure and this and this gets back to why even?
[02:14:19.420 --> 02:14:23.500]  I mean, I obviously I am I'm I harping this a lot but the the
[02:14:24.140 --> 02:14:30.020]  You can't understand in my opinion like you cannot understand product development at Apple without
[02:14:30.820 --> 02:14:35.340]  Thinking very strongly about the Asian market in general in the Chinese market in particular
[02:14:36.820 --> 02:14:40.740]  So there's that term I throw it out there veblum veblum good
[02:14:40.740 --> 02:14:45.820]  Yeah, some people just dries them at the wall because they're like it's not really a real construct guy and I get what they're saying
[02:14:45.820 --> 02:14:54.220]  basically, the idea is when you in general the demand curve works that the cheaper something is the more it sells and
[02:14:54.540 --> 02:15:00.220]  I think in general that that's true for everything right if if an iPhone were cheaper it would sell more
[02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:08.940]  But the the idea of a veblum good is that it's a product for which the more expensive it is the more desirable it becomes
[02:15:09.980 --> 02:15:11.340]  and
[02:15:11.340 --> 02:15:13.340]  This idea certainly
[02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:17.820]  This does this is the case for for some luxury goods
[02:15:17.820 --> 02:15:22.460]  I mean, I think where the confusion is it doesn't necessarily mean they sell more right a a
[02:15:23.260 --> 02:15:30.140]  Hermes bag sells they sell fewer bags in Louis Vuitton, but they are way more desirable and they're way more
[02:15:30.860 --> 02:15:37.260]  Signified and they wouldn't and they wouldn't be as desirable if they were priced exactly exactly exactly, right?
[02:15:37.260 --> 02:15:41.740]  They would not become more more more. Yep. And so there's there are there are brands
[02:15:41.740 --> 02:15:45.260]  I think coaches is something like this where they've they've
[02:15:45.980 --> 02:15:50.220]  Vastly increased their sales. They've made a lot of money like coach has the whole like coach retail or
[02:15:50.780 --> 02:15:56.540]  What's the word I'll let coach outlet and it's a very it's a different it's a different
[02:15:57.180 --> 02:16:02.540]  Design like all designs are different than actual coach stores, but they actually make most of their money there and they sell way more
[02:16:02.540 --> 02:16:05.900]  There's lines out there, you know building all these different designs
[02:16:05.900 --> 02:16:07.900]  They're you know building all the time
[02:16:08.780 --> 02:16:13.500]  But it has absolutely at least in my estimation my observation
[02:16:14.140 --> 02:16:18.780]  And again, this is where I I was grumpy my wife distracted me before but this is where I owe her a lot
[02:16:19.420 --> 02:16:22.140]  It's changed what coach means as a brand
[02:16:22.700 --> 02:16:29.660]  It's become a lot less meaningful a lot less of a signifier of of of anything, you know of
[02:16:29.660 --> 02:16:34.540]  It's like I'm like a mid-class. It's like a mid-class brand instead of a upper class. Absolutely
[02:16:34.540 --> 02:16:40.700]  Yeah, not not not class for people but just where they are competitively with their you know that they're it's it's above
[02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:46.140]  You know, it's more in line with like Michael Kors, right exactly when I think 10-15 years ago
[02:16:46.140 --> 02:16:48.940]  It was it was more on you know
[02:16:49.580 --> 02:16:57.580]  The lower still the lower end of luxury, but now it's not it's it's borderline luxury at all and and that's fine
[02:16:57.580 --> 02:17:01.420]  It's worked out well for them as I understand it. I think they're I think they're doing pretty well
[02:17:01.420 --> 02:17:06.460]  Although I think it I think it over the long run. I think they they may be tapering off a bit now, but
[02:17:07.100 --> 02:17:11.740]  but no in in in China and it's not like this and this is like the
[02:17:12.300 --> 02:17:18.860]  It's gotten a lot better but especially even a year ago the analysis of the iPhone in China was just so wildly off base
[02:17:18.860 --> 02:17:20.940]  Right, like people when they have 5c came out
[02:17:20.940 --> 02:17:26.940]  There's all these articles saying oh a 5c is equivalent to the average monthly wage in China
[02:17:26.940 --> 02:17:30.860]  That's that's a completely meaningless statistic
[02:17:30.860 --> 02:17:36.220]  It means absolutely nothing because there's so much inequality right there and there's so many people that by definition
[02:17:36.220 --> 02:17:42.700]  there's a lot of people that are would make way more than the average average monthly salary and the iPhone
[02:17:43.980 --> 02:17:48.140]  is selling to those people and not just that but in in in
[02:17:48.940 --> 02:17:52.380]  That culture and it's the same thing here in Taiwan, which is obviously, you know, it's Chinese
[02:17:52.380 --> 02:17:59.900]  But I think a lot of Chinese influence cultures the idea of displaying wealth is much more socially acceptable
[02:18:00.380 --> 02:18:05.660]  Than it is in the West right to to like mark go back to ATP like we owe them for this episode
[02:18:05.660 --> 02:18:07.180]  But Marco talked about all right
[02:18:07.180 --> 02:18:12.860]  He would judge someone that walked in with the gold phone and James on my on the podcast with me said the same thing
[02:18:13.260 --> 02:18:14.940]  Uh, that's the exact yeah
[02:18:14.940 --> 02:18:19.500]  Marco's example was do you think that next year at WWDC that we will go out for beers at?
[02:18:19.500 --> 02:18:25.180]  The house of shields or something and as anybody in our indie crowd going to be wearing a gold Apple watch
[02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:28.940]  And he said I'd be embarrassed if I had right exactly and which is a reasonable
[02:18:28.940 --> 02:18:31.820]  It's totally a reasonable thing to say and I know exactly what he's talking about
[02:18:32.220 --> 02:18:35.980]  But I think I think he's wrong. I think there will be people wearing him and
[02:18:36.540 --> 02:18:40.380]  but I also think though that it would be something that it
[02:18:40.860 --> 02:18:43.900]  It might carry a twinge of embarrassment in some context
[02:18:43.900 --> 02:18:49.180]  Whereas you're saying like in Asia would not you know that there is it's there's I you know
[02:18:49.180 --> 02:18:53.420]  I can't put it better than you did that. It's different. I wouldn't be surprised if
[02:18:54.220 --> 02:18:56.220]  we see
[02:18:58.140 --> 02:19:04.540]  Again Apple probably wouldn't break this down, but maybe they would but like an incredible disparity in the breakdown of
[02:19:06.460 --> 02:19:13.820]  You know, I go almost like an inversion, you know, just totally different chart of how many of which model are selling
[02:19:14.420 --> 02:19:16.300]  Apple watch
[02:19:16.300 --> 02:19:20.380]  Being off the charts different in Asia than in the West. Yeah
[02:19:20.940 --> 02:19:27.420]  Sure. Well, I would imagine just the color of iPhones, right? It is almost impossible to see an iPhone 5c or 5s
[02:19:28.060 --> 02:19:30.060]  Here in Taiwan, that's not gold
[02:19:30.460 --> 02:19:35.460]  Like if you see ten iPhone 5s is nine of them are gold
[02:19:36.780 --> 02:19:42.500]  Like it and that and that's truly cosmetic because it's not gold gold. It's gold color, right?
[02:19:42.500 --> 02:19:50.540]  But that's good. So that I guess it's not a perfect signifier. But the idea like gold especially is is very meaningful
[02:19:50.540 --> 02:19:55.900]  It's a very like there's all this like all this stuff about it's weird like though the relationships
[02:19:56.380 --> 02:20:00.980]  With the Chinese with money is very very different than the West like in the West especially in America
[02:20:00.980 --> 02:20:03.140]  There's this kind of you know, Puritan is like
[02:20:03.900 --> 02:20:08.900]  You know, you ought to be humble and and and hide your wealth and and things like that
[02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:14.740]  Not at all the case here like money and the idea of money is everywhere gifts are money like the idea giving presents
[02:20:14.740 --> 02:20:18.900]  You're right is different you give money when you go to a wedding
[02:20:18.900 --> 02:20:23.180]  For example, you bring an envelope you give it to them. They pull out them. They have someone sitting at the door
[02:20:23.180 --> 02:20:25.580]  They pull out the money they count it and they write it down
[02:20:25.740 --> 02:20:30.740]  So there's a list of how much everyone made and it's like it's there just do it right there
[02:20:30.740 --> 02:20:33.500]  Like it's it's it's not it's not weird, right?
[02:20:33.500 --> 02:20:39.900]  You have Chinese New Year and you eat these dumplings that are meant to look like money like old kind of money
[02:20:39.900 --> 02:20:42.740]  so the idea is you can make more money in the next year like just
[02:20:43.580 --> 02:20:49.180]  It sounds I know it sounds totally bizarre to people in the West to have this like fixation with money
[02:20:49.300 --> 02:20:55.100]  But it's not it's not weird here. It's just like that's just it is the way it is
[02:20:55.100 --> 02:21:00.660]  And and the iPhone absolutely fits into this where people absolutely without a question
[02:21:01.420 --> 02:21:03.140]  Cannot be disputed
[02:21:03.140 --> 02:21:09.820]  will buy an iPhone simply because it's the most expensive and it shows that you can afford an iPhone and
[02:21:11.060 --> 02:21:13.140]  Without a doubt the gold watch will fit in here
[02:21:13.140 --> 02:21:17.100]  even if it is disposable even if it can't be replaced people will buy a
[02:21:17.500 --> 02:21:23.660]  $5,000 gold watch because it's a five. It's a it's a gold watch and it's in even more
[02:21:23.660 --> 02:21:27.700]  so it's on your wrist all the time people will see it all the time and and
[02:21:27.980 --> 02:21:32.660]  And that's okay like and that's it's not frowned upon at by any means
[02:21:32.660 --> 02:21:35.380]  It's it's it's something everyone aspires to
[02:21:36.420 --> 02:21:42.340]  All right, there's two types of in broad strokes two types of people who buy an expensive watch. There's the crowd
[02:21:42.340 --> 02:21:45.080]  There's a type of person who buys one and selects one
[02:21:46.060 --> 02:21:52.700]  Probably a Rolex because Rolex is the by far the preeminent brand but and select not just any Rolex but one that is god
[02:21:52.700 --> 02:21:53.060]  Yeah
[02:21:53.060 --> 02:21:58.740]  you know maybe diamonds around the bezel or something like that because they want people to see that they're wearing a
[02:21:59.300 --> 02:22:01.180]  diamond bezel
[02:22:01.180 --> 02:22:04.980]  Rolex and then there's the type who might spend even more like
[02:22:05.660 --> 02:22:12.340]  $85,000 on a watch I just saw one on the Houdini that was 85 grand but that it's like a watch guys watch and nobody
[02:22:13.020 --> 02:22:19.900]  No typical person would even notice that it's anything except other watch people and it's you know
[02:22:19.900 --> 02:22:24.940]  Maybe in a course of a week only one person who would see you wearing that watch would know what it is
[02:22:24.940 --> 02:22:29.340]  But that to that that person knows exactly what it is and it's like a like being in a secret society
[02:22:29.340 --> 02:22:34.780]  Right, and I think that and so I think the gold Apple watch is that's not the second
[02:22:34.780 --> 02:22:40.100]  The cold Apple watch is the first but it is I've I bought the gold app, but it would be the second if we're modular
[02:22:40.100 --> 02:22:42.100]  That's what's so interesting about it, right?
[02:22:42.660 --> 02:22:45.060]  Well, I think the stainless steel is sort of that though
[02:22:45.060 --> 02:22:49.940]  The stainless steel is because it's stainless steel and a couple people pointed this out. I it's hard to see online
[02:22:50.100 --> 02:22:54.820]  It's the sort of thing that does not photograph. Well jewelry and never photographs. Well
[02:22:54.820 --> 02:22:58.980]  But the stainless steel is polished and it is shiny
[02:22:58.980 --> 02:23:04.620]  I can vouch for that having seen it and tried one on and the aluminum Apple sports
[02:23:04.620 --> 02:23:10.720]  Watch is more like it's I don't know if it is brushed aluminum or whatever the sandblasted thing whatever they do
[02:23:11.300 --> 02:23:16.740]  You know like to the brand new iPhone 6, you know, it's it's not a polished shiny material
[02:23:16.740 --> 02:23:20.580]  It's you know, it's it's matte but at a glance it would be very difficult
[02:23:20.580 --> 02:23:25.780]  to see whether somebody's wearing a stainless steel one or the aluminum one and the bands are
[02:23:25.980 --> 02:23:30.640]  To answer a very common question. The bands are interchangeable between all of them
[02:23:31.260 --> 02:23:36.580]  now 38 and 42 millimeters take different size bands, but if you buy a
[02:23:37.020 --> 02:23:43.700]  Stainless steel Apple watch you could buy you you know, you can fit any of the other bands on it that are meant for the larger size
[02:23:45.060 --> 02:23:47.060]  Right new I I think that's um
[02:23:47.060 --> 02:23:53.300]  The the band thing are they gonna come with like it seems it's just on the site that the aluminum
[02:23:53.660 --> 02:23:59.060]  Watches will be available with a certain set of bands and the stainless steel ones will be available with a different set and I get you
[02:23:59.060 --> 02:24:04.140]  Can change them after the fact but when you buy it or yeah up front are you your options limited? I
[02:24:05.340 --> 02:24:08.220]  Don't know. I don't think they've answered that and that gets into the retail thing
[02:24:08.220 --> 02:24:13.100]  I mean we're pushing on the two and a half hour mark here. So I kind of like this is hurry, but I
[02:24:13.100 --> 02:24:18.340]  I do think that the retail question is fascinating in terms of how are you going?
[02:24:18.340 --> 02:24:22.220]  How what are your configuration options going to be and how are they gonna set that up in the store?
[02:24:22.220 --> 02:24:25.660]  And I I said it right away. I said right away. I thought man
[02:24:25.660 --> 02:24:30.980]  This is why Angela aren't what a why they hired her and be why she took the job because it's it
[02:24:31.020 --> 02:24:33.020]  You know that there's a clear
[02:24:33.500 --> 02:24:38.220]  enormous challenge ahead to turn the Apple stores as we know them into a
[02:24:38.700 --> 02:24:42.260]  Place where you would buy stuff like this and then how much are they gonna keep in stock?
[02:24:42.260 --> 02:24:45.340]  We are gonna be able to buy the gold one in an Apple store
[02:24:45.340 --> 02:24:52.540]  Are they gonna sell them at places like Torneo, you know places that that sell, you know a variety of you know
[02:24:53.860 --> 02:24:55.580]  like Torneo is a
[02:24:55.580 --> 02:25:02.300]  Reseller of wristwatches, but you can buy different brands. It's not just just Rolex or just omega or whatever
[02:25:02.300 --> 02:25:07.220]  They you know, would there be like an Apple kiosk in it or no where you buy the addition here
[02:25:07.220 --> 02:25:09.860]  Here's I don't know sting is it was rumored
[02:25:09.860 --> 02:25:16.460]  It was rumored before the event that Apple was in negotiation was talking with Nordstrom about
[02:25:16.860 --> 02:25:22.940]  The Apple pay thing but Nordstrom wasn't wasn't up on the screen when they talked about they talked about you know
[02:25:23.140 --> 02:25:25.220]  several other retailers but not Nordstrom
[02:25:26.460 --> 02:25:33.020]  Nordstrom actually makes a lot of sense for a gold watch like the Nordstrom plays they don't play in the very high end
[02:25:33.020 --> 02:25:35.020]  but they play in the medium and
[02:25:35.020 --> 02:25:40.700]  And of especially when it comes to bags and stuff like that in luxury they sell luxury goods
[02:25:40.700 --> 02:25:46.820]  They don't sell the crazy expensive luxury goods, but they sell kind of the mid-range luxury and I wonder right?
[02:25:46.820 --> 02:25:47.780]  they don't have the
[02:25:47.780 --> 02:25:52.780]  $85,000 watch but they might have easily could have a $5,000 right exactly. And I think that's that I
[02:25:53.700 --> 02:25:55.020]  wonder if
[02:25:55.020 --> 02:26:00.780]  You know, I think you linked to or I linked to the the the Robert X Kringle
[02:26:00.780 --> 02:26:02.540]  And I know I know he's a controversial here
[02:26:02.540 --> 02:26:09.420]  But I thought this particular column was it was very interesting where he surmised that the gold would mostly be at jewelers and would
[02:26:09.660 --> 02:26:12.740]  Yeah, I think he's back on his good meds or something. I thought so
[02:26:13.460 --> 02:26:16.180]  Yeah, I got some flack for even looking to him at all
[02:26:17.020 --> 02:26:18.820]  But the other thing too is this is an advantage
[02:26:18.820 --> 02:26:22.180]  I I suspect Apple did want to be there by the holidays just because who wouldn't
[02:26:22.380 --> 02:26:27.860]  But I think this is an advantage to being in the spring where you can't really rework the stores in the run up to the
[02:26:27.860 --> 02:26:34.980]  Holidays right there. It's it's just a mad house in there. Whereas in the spring. There's a lot more latitude to to
[02:26:35.740 --> 02:26:38.020]  Move stuff around. I don't even think they came close
[02:26:38.020 --> 02:26:43.340]  But at whatever point where they thought maybe they would launch in time for holiday 2014. That was a long time ago
[02:26:43.340 --> 02:26:46.860]  Maybe even a year ago. I I would be shocked if even at the beginning of this year
[02:26:46.860 --> 02:26:48.460]  There was any hope that they would do it
[02:26:48.460 --> 02:26:53.380]  You know, I I think you know and honestly, I mean just think about just when did Angela aren't come on board
[02:26:53.380 --> 02:26:56.580]  I don't think she came on board full-time until June or May or something like that
[02:26:56.580 --> 02:27:01.820]  Oh that reminds me one thing about the retail thing. Um, the the most interesting
[02:27:01.820 --> 02:27:04.420]  I think we talked about this on the last time I was on the show
[02:27:04.420 --> 02:27:09.020]  But one of the most interesting hires they made was the LVMH guy and was interesting about it
[02:27:09.020 --> 02:27:12.980]  Was that he wasn't a product guy. He was a channel guy and by channel
[02:27:12.980 --> 02:27:16.780]  I mean like where your products are sold, so he helped negotiate like for
[02:27:17.580 --> 02:27:23.180]  Tag Heuer like where Tag Heuer watches were sold which meant he had lots of relationships with
[02:27:23.180 --> 02:27:29.220]  With places like Nordstrom with department stores. So here in Asia, like it's all department stores. Like there are no malls per se
[02:27:29.220 --> 02:27:34.780]  there are department stores where it's one entity, but within that there's like sub shops basically and
[02:27:35.340 --> 02:27:43.220]  All these have luxury goods and they have boutiques and stuff like that within within the thing and there's definitely a it's a different
[02:27:43.220 --> 02:27:49.700]  Sort of retail environment than anyone at Apple would have had experience with with previously
[02:27:49.700 --> 02:27:53.980]  LVMH for those who don't know is the Louis Vuitton
[02:27:53.980 --> 02:27:58.380]  Moet parent company. Moet Hennessy. Yeah Moet Champagne, right? So it's
[02:27:58.380 --> 02:28:00.380]  And then Hennessy cognac
[02:28:01.380 --> 02:28:05.580]  Right, but they they have a whole portfolio stuff. I think they have Dior they have like a whole
[02:28:06.380 --> 02:28:09.700]  They have a ton of brands super interesting company actually
[02:28:10.700 --> 02:28:11.700]  but
[02:28:11.700 --> 02:28:16.420]  That hire was interesting because it because of the channel angle
[02:28:16.420 --> 02:28:22.220]  Right all of his experience all of his experience points to the I think I I can't imagine
[02:28:22.220 --> 02:28:27.660]  I mean anybody can always change course careers, you know change careers course and do something different
[02:28:27.660 --> 02:28:30.860]  But if he's gonna do anything based on what he did at LVMH
[02:28:30.860 --> 02:28:37.620]  It would be getting the Apple watch into other retailers, right? And and this sort of retailers that would sell Tag Heuer watches
[02:28:38.620 --> 02:28:43.860]  And Tag Heuer is not selling three or with the places that are selling Tag Heuer watches
[02:28:43.860 --> 02:28:47.220]  Are not selling swatches like three or three hundred dollar watches
[02:28:47.700 --> 02:28:53.180]  So a few more points one. I wanted to hit I think the last one from ATP follow-up, but
[02:28:53.900 --> 02:28:55.900]  John Sirkusa, I
[02:28:57.100 --> 02:28:59.100]  Think he said, you know
[02:28:59.340 --> 02:29:05.060]  In terms of quantity clearly that the sport edition is is gonna outsell the the gold edition
[02:29:05.060 --> 02:29:09.740]  I keep calling him addition and they caught the Apple calls them collections to avoid calling it the Apple edition
[02:29:09.740 --> 02:29:15.860]  So so the Apple sport collection is going to outsell the Apple edition collection in terms of quantity
[02:29:17.620 --> 02:29:23.700]  But I am not entirely sure at all that in terms and this is in contrast to his take
[02:29:23.700 --> 02:29:29.540]  I don't know that Apple edition collection might be the one that makes the most revenue
[02:29:29.540 --> 02:29:35.620]  Well the more I think it it'll be so yeah profit and revenue that it you know
[02:29:35.620 --> 02:29:42.500]  that they're going to it is not just a even if it's I think it's going to sell more than 1% of the unit
[02:29:42.820 --> 02:29:49.820]  But even if it only sells two three four percent, I think it's gonna be so expensive that it will it will easily be
[02:29:50.540 --> 02:29:57.100]  You know ten or twenty times more profitable than the three hundred forty nine dollar one and
[02:29:57.660 --> 02:30:00.660]  So even if it only sells five percent of the units
[02:30:00.660 --> 02:30:05.180]  Worldwide, that's fifty percent of the revenue. No for sure
[02:30:05.180 --> 02:30:11.740]  and the other thing too is if if this is another reason to presume that Apple is being more ambitious than less when it comes to
[02:30:11.740 --> 02:30:17.180]  The functionality of the watch because if it turns out to be a watch that you want to wear every day
[02:30:18.460 --> 02:30:20.660]  You're almost certainly gonna buy additional bands
[02:30:21.180 --> 02:30:24.620]  right and and right some of those bands are not going to be cheap and
[02:30:25.260 --> 02:30:27.900]  Especially if you're buying a watch that's not going to be cheap
[02:30:27.900 --> 02:30:36.260]  And especially if you're buying a gold edition and you actually use it and you actually it becomes it becomes a regular part of your life
[02:30:37.300 --> 02:30:41.340]  you're gonna want to have different bands for to make it fit in different occasions and
[02:30:42.900 --> 02:30:47.380]  What's what's so Apple about this and you you nailed this in a wink yesterday
[02:30:48.100 --> 02:30:52.940]  About you know, there is the you winked an article where I think Amir Ferdy said they don't want to cannibalize phones
[02:30:52.940 --> 02:31:00.260]  No, not not only is it right not only is it key to Apple's longevity and success that they are willing to cannibalize their
[02:31:00.260 --> 02:31:06.860]  Own products. What's so brilliant about Apple is they have always cannibalized their products with more profitable products and
[02:31:07.460 --> 02:31:10.900]  In an iPad, it has better margins than a Mac
[02:31:11.620 --> 02:31:16.740]  An iPhone not only has better margins than an iPod. It's also way more expensive
[02:31:16.740 --> 02:31:19.060]  So they're getting more on the top and bottom line
[02:31:19.060 --> 02:31:23.700]  like if you're gonna cannibalize your products, it wouldn't it be great if you could do with an even more expensive objects and
[02:31:24.340 --> 02:31:26.660]  if you're talking about having an eye a
[02:31:26.900 --> 02:31:34.260]  Watch that is the center of your existence in five six years from now and oh by the way you paid
[02:31:34.980 --> 02:31:39.900]  $2,000 or five thousand dollars for it plus a bunch of like $500 accessories
[02:31:40.820 --> 02:31:45.460]  Apple is pretty okay with you using your iPhone just a little bit less than you did before
[02:31:45.460 --> 02:31:50.980]  Yeah, one of the things that I'm in terms like you said are you how customizable is it gonna be when you buy it?
[02:31:50.980 --> 02:31:53.740]  I presume if you order it online, it's
[02:31:54.260 --> 02:31:58.340]  Going to be completely customizable you get whatever band whichever one you want
[02:31:58.340 --> 02:31:59.500]  I don't know
[02:31:59.500 --> 02:32:01.500]  but if you go in and they only have a couple of
[02:32:01.820 --> 02:32:07.340]  Presets set up that you've you know pick from these to start with and if you want to buy a second band by a second band
[02:32:07.340 --> 02:32:12.300]  one of the things that's interesting to me and I don't know how it's gonna work out is that have you noticed that the
[02:32:12.300 --> 02:32:18.500]  The side of the digital crown like the part if you were gonna press it in the digital crown is colored
[02:32:20.740 --> 02:32:28.340]  To match the band like when I saw one like the smaller size with the red like a rich maroon band
[02:32:28.860 --> 02:32:34.940]  The button wasn't black. It was maroon it matched right but only not on all the additions so sport for example
[02:32:34.940 --> 02:32:36.940]  They're all the same. I think that's yeah
[02:32:36.940 --> 02:32:45.060]  Edition, yeah, it's it on it. Yeah the edition edition. So that says to me that they're going to be
[02:32:47.180 --> 02:32:49.180]  That they're going to be
[02:32:49.460 --> 02:32:53.180]  Matched. Yeah sold as a unit with a band and you could buy another band
[02:32:53.180 --> 02:32:57.460]  But then like if you buy like a white band, you're still gonna have the red button on the on the side
[02:32:59.340 --> 02:33:03.180]  Who knows but I did think that was interesting and it jumped out at me and I don't I don't know
[02:33:03.180 --> 02:33:11.300]  Yeah, I'm just I'm looking through the site now. It's only the addition that has different colors the stainless steel is all black
[02:33:12.020 --> 02:33:18.060]  And the sport is always just aluminum. So that's another kind of signifier of which of which one you bought
[02:33:19.380 --> 02:33:21.380]  right
[02:33:24.260 --> 02:33:28.900]  I did notice I saw Johnny I've at the event and he was wearing
[02:33:28.900 --> 02:33:32.340]  The Addition Edition, but he had it on a sport band
[02:33:34.180 --> 02:33:39.900]  I couldn't tell I saw him on stage and I also saw him walking by I saw Tim Cook walking by
[02:33:40.980 --> 02:33:44.500]  he was either wearing the the stainless steel one or the
[02:33:44.980 --> 02:33:49.380]  Sport one again, like I said at a glance, you know while he's walking into motion
[02:33:49.380 --> 02:33:51.380]  It was too hard to see how shiny it was
[02:33:51.380 --> 02:33:55.140]  But he also was wearing the sport band which I thought was kind of interesting
[02:33:55.140 --> 02:34:01.540]  That they they both wore the sport band even with the one that I think is going to be multiple thousands of dollars
[02:34:02.260 --> 02:34:03.060]  That is interesting
[02:34:03.060 --> 02:34:08.180]  I mean you think that they would have at least a prototype in the lap that they could wear even if they weren't you know
[02:34:08.180 --> 02:34:10.180]  widely available
[02:34:10.180 --> 02:34:14.340]  All right. Well, no, they're well, they had the bands, you know there for us to in the press to try
[02:34:14.340 --> 02:34:16.340]  You know, we could try on all the bands
[02:34:17.060 --> 02:34:17.460]  You know
[02:34:17.460 --> 02:34:21.060]  but the ones that they're wearing is like they're their actual daily use as they use the
[02:34:21.060 --> 02:34:26.420]  you know, but the ones that they're wearing is like they're their actual daily use as they you know, test the things
[02:34:27.060 --> 02:34:29.460]  uh, at least at the event they you know wore the the
[02:34:30.260 --> 02:34:32.820]  Everyman's watch, you know the band
[02:34:33.700 --> 02:34:36.660]  All right. Last question. I have I don't know watch and I think this is one
[02:34:36.660 --> 02:34:39.140]  I haven't seen anybody talk about but I thought it would be I thought it's pretty interesting
[02:34:39.700 --> 02:34:41.700]  Where do you think they're going to assemble them?
[02:34:42.820 --> 02:34:45.140]  Yeah, i've gotten this question too. I I
[02:34:45.140 --> 02:34:53.700]  Is it I think it depends on the mod I want to say I don't know it's because especially apple watch sport
[02:34:54.580 --> 02:35:01.220]  Sport I believe will be assembled in china at foxconn or similar type place. I don't know that you can sell
[02:35:02.260 --> 02:35:04.820]  A ten thousand dollar watch that is assembled in china
[02:35:06.020 --> 02:35:10.260]  I think in the same way that when in my article I said like one reason I think I called it apple watch instead of
[02:35:10.260 --> 02:35:16.500]  I watch is I watch sounds like a cutesy thing that costs 350 bucks does not sound like something a piece of jewelry
[02:35:16.500 --> 02:35:18.500]  You spend ten thousand dollars on
[02:35:18.820 --> 02:35:24.100]  Assembled in china does not compute to me for a five thousand ten thousand dollar product
[02:35:24.980 --> 02:35:26.100]  that
[02:35:26.100 --> 02:35:30.180]  And it was and it's a big and for all their comparisons to the watch world
[02:35:30.420 --> 02:35:34.340]  That's a big deal where watches are made, you know swiss made is
[02:35:35.060 --> 02:35:37.940]  is the gold standard for uh
[02:35:37.940 --> 02:35:40.340]  You know, it's just like a sign of quality
[02:35:41.060 --> 02:35:44.260]  You know, it's a badge of call. It's a badge of honor for the whole country in switzerland
[02:35:45.540 --> 02:35:52.900]  And they certainly obviously been making making efforts in this regard and especially if they're um
[02:35:54.740 --> 02:35:56.740]  I mean they see it
[02:35:56.740 --> 02:36:04.180]  How many pieces the more the more that especially with this chip right because a lot a lot of the manual labor
[02:36:04.180 --> 02:36:11.300]  Manual labor, um when it comes to building a computer is still like on the motherboard and it's still like like a lot of
[02:36:11.460 --> 02:36:15.060]  A lot of it's like is done by hand because it requires very precise
[02:36:15.940 --> 02:36:19.780]  You know sort of imitation and there's been a there's been report
[02:36:19.780 --> 02:36:22.340]  You just do a search on google about like tour of a motherboard factory
[02:36:22.420 --> 02:36:24.900]  I think anatec has done has done some of these before
[02:36:24.900 --> 02:36:33.700]  Um, like it's very very manual and that's where the payoff for having a lower cost labor force pays off in this sort of stuff
[02:36:34.180 --> 02:36:38.100]  If you're building the entire computer on a chip, that's you know
[02:36:38.820 --> 02:36:40.820]  Completely wrapped up in resin. That's
[02:36:41.620 --> 02:36:48.820]  By definition the computer is being built entirely by a machine and it doesn't really matter where you run a machine
[02:36:49.460 --> 02:36:54.180]  um, it's gonna cost, you know, obviously the the operator costs will vary but
[02:36:54.180 --> 02:36:55.300]  the
[02:36:55.300 --> 02:36:59.300]  The sort of person that could operate that sort of machine is going to be almost expensive in china as they are
[02:36:59.620 --> 02:37:01.620]  As they are in the united states
[02:37:03.060 --> 02:37:07.140]  All right, and I so I could either see that that this is going to be a huge
[02:37:08.020 --> 02:37:13.300]  Shift, you know that the the mac pro is just the beginning but that maybe they'll be assembled in the us
[02:37:14.100 --> 02:37:18.260]  And I don't know and at the very least I wouldn't be surprised if the addition
[02:37:18.980 --> 02:37:20.980]  Edition is assembled in the us
[02:37:20.980 --> 02:37:24.980]  Because again, if you're going to sell it for ten thousand dollars, they can afford
[02:37:26.180 --> 02:37:27.860]  You know the difference in
[02:37:28.500 --> 02:37:29.460]  hourly
[02:37:29.460 --> 02:37:36.580]  Wage for the people doing the actual assembly. So do you think and it adds to the entire like it's that's an intangible factor
[02:37:36.660 --> 02:37:39.540]  Right, which I think you're driving at it. It means something
[02:37:41.780 --> 02:37:47.460]  To be to have that made made in usa made usa label even even to people who aren't in the us, right?
[02:37:47.460 --> 02:37:52.500]  It's it's it's yeah, you made it the point to the watch thing. I guess my question for you is is apple
[02:37:52.500 --> 02:37:57.540]  Who is apple targeting? Are they targeting people who don't wear watches but do carry iphones?
[02:37:57.540 --> 02:38:01.300]  Or do you think they are very much targeting people who wear watches today?
[02:38:02.500 --> 02:38:05.620]  I think that they are I don't think they would have invited I think it's both though
[02:38:05.780 --> 02:38:09.860]  I think that they they see it as an opportunity. They see people who don't wear watches as as
[02:38:10.900 --> 02:38:12.900]  I think it's both it's you know, hey
[02:38:12.900 --> 02:38:18.180]  You if you don't wear a watch today, your wrist is already open so we don't have to convince you to switch watches
[02:38:18.180 --> 02:38:24.420]  We just have to convince you to buy one. Your wrist is already there waiting for it. And I think they're absolutely courting
[02:38:25.860 --> 02:38:29.540]  People who already wear watches. I don't think there's any other explanation for the time
[02:38:29.540 --> 02:38:34.420]  They spent in the event talking about the iWatch's accuracy, which is baffling to me at first
[02:38:35.140 --> 02:38:40.820]  Because of course, it's accurate all computers with a clock are incredibly accurate compared to
[02:38:40.820 --> 02:38:42.420]  You know
[02:38:42.420 --> 02:38:50.260]  Mechanical watches, you know, my iphone doesn't lose time. I mean this stuff about 50 millisecond precision
[02:38:51.940 --> 02:38:57.860]  Is a little crazy, but I think it's somehow trying to set it up as a watch as a watch guy's watch
[02:38:57.860 --> 02:39:02.820]  Yeah, but I mean the watch guy doesn't have a watch because it's accurate that that that i'm still confused. I know
[02:39:03.380 --> 02:39:05.380]  I I I I
[02:39:05.380 --> 02:39:08.260]  Yeah, I don't know. I'm still not sure who that is for
[02:39:08.260 --> 02:39:13.700]  Well, I I think they were trying to land the idea that this is a watch like it like there there is
[02:39:14.260 --> 02:39:17.860]  That is a reason to actually the reason to buy it is because it's now that I think about it
[02:39:17.860 --> 02:39:23.300]  It wasn't actually I guess it wasn't for watched people. It was for the lay person's
[02:39:23.940 --> 02:39:29.780]  Expectation for what a watch person would yeah, exactly. They weren't actually speaking directly to watch people they were expect they're
[02:39:30.500 --> 02:39:35.620]  Talking to like the writers in the audience who don't know the watch world but their imagination of it
[02:39:35.620 --> 02:39:41.940]  Is that it's you know, of course act time time accuracy is a important. No, I well, I think
[02:39:42.660 --> 02:39:47.940]  To me. I I really think the most like this question of modularity is is absolutely
[02:39:48.500 --> 02:39:52.020]  Is is unbelievably fascinating and I think will completely change
[02:39:52.740 --> 02:39:56.660]  if it's true would completely change the entire expectation and
[02:39:57.540 --> 02:40:03.540]  Idea of what this watch is because yeah if it's not modular if it's just a
[02:40:03.540 --> 02:40:09.860]  Consumer electronics device disposable consumer electronics device. I don't think they are really targeting watch people
[02:40:10.820 --> 02:40:16.980]  Because they watch people don't buy watches they buy watches for very like
[02:40:17.540 --> 02:40:23.140]  Specific reasons that would not be addressed by an Apple watch and in this case the edition version the gold version
[02:40:23.380 --> 02:40:29.300]  Really is just all about skimming off money from people who are willing to throw it at Apple in Asia and which is I guess
[02:40:29.300 --> 02:40:34.500]  It's it's it's fine. That's fine. There's a fine reason to do that. It's kind of a a unsatisfying
[02:40:35.700 --> 02:40:41.780]  Unsatisfying response on the other hand if it is modular and you're when you buy an addition
[02:40:41.780 --> 02:40:47.780]  You're buying something that Apple is saying will be good for at least what 10 years or maybe ideally a lifetime
[02:40:48.660 --> 02:40:51.460]  Now you actually are very much targeting
[02:40:52.100 --> 02:40:56.740]  You're you're targeting people who value watches for their intrinsic like
[02:40:56.740 --> 02:41:04.580]  Because of because it you're targeting watch guys and and I think it's about cutting off future watch
[02:41:04.580 --> 02:41:10.820]  guys from becoming watch guys and women watch people that that it's you know for young people who've never worn one and
[02:41:11.220 --> 02:41:16.020]  As they get more money and they become more successful and they can afford more expensive things that they're not even going to consider
[02:41:16.260 --> 02:41:22.100]  A traditional watch because they can go this route and they've already gotten in the habit of wearing one from the sport edition
[02:41:22.100 --> 02:41:24.100]  They bought when they were you know
[02:41:24.100 --> 02:41:28.660]  In the 350. Well, not just that but the reason to know I completely agree
[02:41:29.300 --> 02:41:35.540]  What I think just occurs to me is a reason why Apple might want to do the modular thing is just speaking for myself
[02:41:36.100 --> 02:41:39.860]  If it's if it's a throwaway, I'll buy the sport if it's modular
[02:41:39.860 --> 02:41:45.140]  I'll buy the stainless steel like it's like it's it's pretty obvious and I
[02:41:45.860 --> 02:41:49.460]  Suspect that thinking it's not just that they'll appeal to watch guys
[02:41:49.460 --> 02:41:56.500]  But I think their ability to to lever people up to a higher margin product will be drastically enhanced
[02:41:56.500 --> 02:41:58.900]  But if they were able to to pull that off
[02:41:59.780 --> 02:42:05.300]  And it would explain why that's at the the the mid price tier is the one that's being shown
[02:42:05.300 --> 02:42:09.700]  You know established as the regular to know totally the one that just has the play
[02:42:11.380 --> 02:42:17.140]  This removes all these I think this makes all these questions that people are objecting to with the watch of the watch
[02:42:17.140 --> 02:42:24.740]  of the why much less objectionable because now it's not just that Apple is selling a a a
[02:42:25.380 --> 02:42:32.020]  Throwaway device like wait because the the question of why would you spend money on this is very much tied into the question of
[02:42:32.180 --> 02:42:37.860]  Why would I spend money on a product that is gonna be worthless in two years that question changes?
[02:42:38.580 --> 02:42:42.500]  Very fundamentally if you know, you're buying something that has longevity
[02:42:42.500 --> 02:42:48.260]  Like the the sort of thing like it tells time and just has it just has a disposable component, right?
[02:42:48.820 --> 02:42:52.180]  It's enough to just be a watch then if you know it lasts a long time
[02:42:52.180 --> 02:42:54.820]  It's enough to just be a health tracker when you know, it lasts a long time
[02:42:55.540 --> 02:43:01.780]  I don't understand. I don't not fully aware of the laws surrounding how and when things need to be
[02:43:02.660 --> 02:43:06.020]  Said where they're made. It's my understanding though that like it's
[02:43:06.980 --> 02:43:10.580]  You have to you have to like things that are made in China have to say made in China
[02:43:10.580 --> 02:43:14.340]  Things that are made in China have to say made in China and went to be sold in the US and around the world
[02:43:15.620 --> 02:43:18.900]  It's not you know, apple doesn't necessarily choose to to print
[02:43:19.380 --> 02:43:23.780]  uh designed by apple in california assembled in china on all these devices like that's
[02:43:24.340 --> 02:43:28.420]  There's a legal obligation there the apple watch that they've shown has no printed
[02:43:29.860 --> 02:43:34.020]  Indication of where they're made there's nothing and if you look at the case back where they have all this nice type
[02:43:34.740 --> 02:43:36.660]  Stamped into it doesn't say that
[02:43:36.660 --> 02:43:42.340]  Most watches say it on the dial at the bottom of the dial. It'll say made in japan or swiss-made
[02:43:42.900 --> 02:43:44.900]  um japanese movement
[02:43:45.060 --> 02:43:47.060]  um
[02:43:47.060 --> 02:43:53.700]  Can they do that in software? I don't know and and if it's modular can they have the s1?
[02:43:54.740 --> 02:43:55.940]  made in
[02:43:55.940 --> 02:43:57.940]  japan and a foxconn
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:04.260]  Factory sealed up and shipped to the us and have the have it put into the watch over here
[02:44:04.260 --> 02:44:10.660]  What would what what what does that mean? Does that if you know how much of it if the whole s1 was
[02:44:11.300 --> 02:44:17.220]  Manufactured in china. Can they still say that the watch is assembled in the us because the sapphire and the band
[02:44:17.780 --> 02:44:22.660]  And the battery and everything was snapped into place by someone in that. Yes, the answer is yes
[02:44:22.900 --> 02:44:27.380]  Uh, the iphone says made in china, but actually the value of the iphone
[02:44:28.180 --> 02:44:32.820]  Taiwan and korea especially make way more money off of every iphone than china does
[02:44:32.820 --> 02:44:39.700]  The made in china applies to just the final assembly and so they could assemble in like i'm sure it'd be the case like
[02:44:39.940 --> 02:44:43.060]  I mean taiwan is like even more so today like
[02:44:43.940 --> 02:44:47.460]  Is very much tied up in the iphone. Oh tons of the components are made here
[02:44:47.700 --> 02:44:53.140]  um, i'm sure it would be a similar thing with with the uh with the watch but
[02:44:53.700 --> 02:44:55.700]  All that matters is the final assembly
[02:44:56.740 --> 02:45:00.820]  I think I think then I really do think that at least the
[02:45:00.820 --> 02:45:05.300]  Edition and I think maybe even the stainless will be assembled in the us and that's something that they could add later
[02:45:05.300 --> 02:45:07.380]  Like because you had they have the printing on the back
[02:45:07.380 --> 02:45:12.420]  I would imagine that they would put it there if they did but there's no reason for them to have it now because it's not
[02:45:12.420 --> 02:45:15.300]  It's not for sale on the prototypes right? Not for sale
[02:45:15.860 --> 02:45:21.300]  But I I just don't see how you can sell a high-end watch that's made in china and I know that that sort of thinking
[02:45:21.300 --> 02:45:26.740]  Kind of did in the swiss industry in the 70s like when they had their dark ages when quartz watches first became a thing
[02:45:26.740 --> 02:45:31.220]  One of the reasons they wrote them off was that they were all made in japan and they're like nobody's gonna buy it
[02:45:31.940 --> 02:45:33.940]  Watch from japan. Japan means crap
[02:45:34.180 --> 02:45:40.180]  You know, it was you know, the watch industry ran into the same japanese buzzsaw that the car automotive industry did
[02:45:40.340 --> 02:45:43.780]  You know, nobody's gonna buy japanese cars japanese stuff is a junk
[02:45:44.660 --> 02:45:48.740]  And you know, there's that thinking that made in china is sort of a badge of
[02:45:49.380 --> 02:45:54.340]  Well, not a shame, but it's not a badge of honor. It doesn't stand for quality made in china just means well
[02:45:54.340 --> 02:46:00.500]  Everything's made in china. Um made in the usa means something right and the well the thing is is that
[02:46:00.740 --> 02:46:05.700]  The difference with the watch industry in the 70s was there there was no
[02:46:06.260 --> 02:46:12.740]  Like it was all it was all switzerland. So this was completely new whereas apple would be entering an environment now
[02:46:13.060 --> 02:46:17.460]  Where there the the expectation of there being a low end is art is already there
[02:46:17.460 --> 02:46:24.820]  And so whereas the watch like the swiss industry had to deal with basically there was a big watch market
[02:46:24.820 --> 02:46:27.620]  They owned it all and suddenly this whole
[02:46:28.260 --> 02:46:32.340]  And like we've we've talked about before like the consumer market there's it's bifurcated
[02:46:32.340 --> 02:46:37.700]  It's bifurcated between the high end and the low end the loan cares only about price and suddenly there was a new option for price
[02:46:37.700 --> 02:46:43.140]  At the low end and they just couldn't respond apple. That's not going to be surprised for apple. They're they're going to be they're
[02:46:43.140 --> 02:46:49.300]  Everyone knows that that's the case and those products are already on the market. There's already the wear devices there. Um
[02:46:50.580 --> 02:46:52.900]  I'm, not sure if that made sense, but that it made sense in my head
[02:46:55.220 --> 02:46:59.540]  Well, that's a good it's good point. I need to wrap this up. This is possibly record-breaking in length
[02:46:59.540 --> 02:47:01.540]  But there's so much to talk about. Um
[02:47:02.100 --> 02:47:05.300]  Can't even imagine that I thought last week. Maybe i'd get to the watch with renee
[02:47:06.500 --> 02:47:09.540]  Ben thompson, thank you so much for being here
[02:47:09.540 --> 02:47:14.740]  Uh, everybody can read ben on a daily basis, but effectively at uh, your website
[02:47:15.860 --> 02:47:17.860]  trajectory
[02:47:17.860 --> 02:47:23.140]  Yeah, so I I have post a couple free articles a week and then I have the four-page daily update
[02:47:25.060 --> 02:47:29.460]  And it's well worth it, uh, it is great stuff you've been killing it all year. Um,
[02:47:30.020 --> 02:47:34.180]  Your perfect example two of that thing. I linked to it this week of the best way to be right all the time
[02:47:34.740 --> 02:47:36.740]  Or most of the time is to be weak
[02:47:36.740 --> 02:47:40.420]  The best way to be right all the time or most of the time is to be willing to change your mind
[02:47:40.740 --> 02:47:43.700]  Uh, you change your mind on the watch in the course of two weeks
[02:47:45.220 --> 02:47:50.180]  It's true I have two I you know, but I mean that it's a high compliment because it's you know
[02:47:50.580 --> 02:47:55.700]  It's human nature not to you know, we want to be right at the first time and it's more important to just keep thinking
[02:47:55.700 --> 02:48:00.180]  Well, it's not I mean we we both might be wrong too. I think that's what's that's what's so yeah
[02:48:00.420 --> 02:48:02.660]  It's almost like i've already written four things about it
[02:48:02.660 --> 02:48:08.420]  And I I feel like I could i'm always worried about people being bored. But that's what's so it we haven't had
[02:48:09.060 --> 02:48:12.580]  something of the ipad kind of but I I feel this is
[02:48:13.300 --> 02:48:15.560]  What makes this more compelling than the ipad?
[02:48:16.260 --> 02:48:19.300]  For me is that it's smaller and to me. I think
[02:48:19.940 --> 02:48:21.940]  that's that's important like
[02:48:23.220 --> 02:48:25.560]  It makes it a potentially more meaningful
[02:48:26.500 --> 02:48:28.480]  device because
[02:48:28.480 --> 02:48:31.540]  portability will always be a key constraint and
[02:48:31.540 --> 02:48:32.820]  um
[02:48:32.820 --> 02:48:34.820]  It's just so fascinating. I
[02:48:35.940 --> 02:48:36.820]  Yeah
[02:48:36.820 --> 02:48:42.180]  Yeah, the ipad was not like a wow. I can't believe they could make this right right exactly and
[02:48:42.740 --> 02:48:49.540]  Whereas I think the watch is going right and and what that means and people criticize apple not being a why but if you think
[02:48:49.620 --> 02:48:51.620]  about it if you think about it the
[02:48:52.660 --> 02:48:55.540]  There's two alternatives one is that they don't know two is that
[02:48:55.540 --> 02:49:02.580]  They're so far their thinking is so far ahead of where our expectations are that we just like
[02:49:03.140 --> 02:49:08.100]  We we can't catch up and what's fascinating is one it could go either way
[02:49:08.740 --> 02:49:12.020]  Which is makes it really interesting but two if they are so far ahead
[02:49:12.260 --> 02:49:17.460]  there's just like there's so much greenfield to even imagine what might be possible and what might be coming and
[02:49:17.860 --> 02:49:19.860]  No, I haven't been this like
[02:49:19.940 --> 02:49:24.820]  I don't want to say obsessed but just like constantly turning over my head what what a product could be in in
[02:49:24.820 --> 02:49:26.820]  Could be in in a very long time
[02:49:27.300 --> 02:49:28.260]  Yeah
[02:49:28.260 --> 02:49:32.980]  Uh exciting stuff to come. All right. Let me thank my three sponsors great sponsors this week
