[00:00.000 --> 00:03.760]  I think you were on about two months ago? I don't know. I'm trying to mix it up with guests,
[00:03.760 --> 00:08.320]  but I really, really wanted you back now to talk about the watch.
[00:10.160 --> 00:13.120]  Well, needless to say, I have a full range of opinions about it.
[00:13.120 --> 00:18.320]  Right. And Renee and I last week just more or less skipped it because we already
[00:18.320 --> 00:25.760]  filled up two hours with just the iPhone and etc. I forget if I said this to Renee or if I put it
[00:25.760 --> 00:32.160]  in my review. But I really do, I understand, I think I put in my review, but I understand why Apple
[00:32.160 --> 00:39.360]  did it that way in terms of the event, you know, phone, Apple pay, and the introduction of the watch
[00:39.360 --> 00:47.040]  all at once. But it really, to me, gave short, what's the word, what's the word, short, short,
[00:47.040 --> 00:55.600]  short shrift to the iPhone 6, to me. And I understand why they did it. But as a writer,
[00:55.600 --> 01:01.920]  someone trying to get a handle on all of this, it was just impossible, you know, and you get,
[01:01.920 --> 01:06.880]  you know, 30 minutes, 40 minutes after the event to talk to Apple reps. And there was just no way,
[01:08.080 --> 01:13.120]  it always seems to go by fast. And I always come up with questions, good questions, as soon as I'm
[01:13.120 --> 01:18.400]  out of, you know, any event is over. But this time, it was just impossible. It was like, I did,
[01:18.400 --> 01:22.800]  I really felt like there was no way to ask all the questions. Because I wanted to, I wanted an hour
[01:22.800 --> 01:25.360]  to talk about both things, you know, the phone and the watch.
[01:28.400 --> 01:34.240]  You think, look at all the kind of bad news that the phone has gotten this week. And obviously,
[01:34.240 --> 01:39.520]  it's an annual tradition that there's some sort of, some sort of gate, you know, every year.
[01:39.520 --> 01:43.520]  Apple Spotlight had a great post on this saying that basically everyone comes down to people
[01:43.520 --> 01:50.080]  not understanding physics. But if you think about it, the phone never got the positive cycle
[01:50.080 --> 01:55.360]  in some ways. Because it was just the week where everyone's talking about the phone was drowned
[01:55.360 --> 01:58.960]  out by everyone talking about the watch. But it's still got the negative cycle. I don't think it's
[01:58.960 --> 02:02.800]  going to hurt. I don't think it's going to hurt it really. But it's interesting that the whole
[02:02.800 --> 02:10.880]  cycle has been kind of upset a little bit. Yeah, I definitely think so. And you know,
[02:10.880 --> 02:16.080]  it's, you know, where it gets we're coming up on three weeks since the event?
[02:17.280 --> 02:23.760]  I think so. Yeah. It'll be three weeks come Tuesday. So, you know, it just still feels like
[02:23.760 --> 02:31.520]  that iPhone, yeah, it just never got the positive part. Everybody was so, you know, into the pay
[02:31.520 --> 02:37.760]  and the watch in the first week. Then there were just a few days, you know, that brief period
[02:37.760 --> 02:44.400]  between when a review embargo is over and then when people actually get their hands on their phones,
[02:44.400 --> 02:51.360]  you know, Friday morning. And then that was it, you know. Yeah. It's interesting. I mean, I've
[02:52.560 --> 02:59.040]  obviously, well, we should talk about it more. The whole iPhone and watch being together,
[02:59.040 --> 03:06.320]  because I thought pre-event it made a lot of sense, because I went into the event looking for the
[03:06.320 --> 03:11.120]  watch me more of a phone accessory. And that was some of my criticism of the event was that the way
[03:11.120 --> 03:17.600]  it was presented. It wasn't really an accessory. It needed it, but it wasn't. But if that's the case,
[03:17.600 --> 03:23.920]  then maybe they didn't need to necessarily be presented together. So, it's actually really
[03:23.920 --> 03:30.960]  interesting to think about the kind of the optics perspective of how they introduced both products.
[03:32.320 --> 03:37.680]  They didn't need to be introduced together. And part of why they didn't need to be is that the watch
[03:37.680 --> 03:43.200]  does work with, I think all the way back to the 4S, or at least to the iPhone 5, maybe it's just
[03:43.200 --> 03:50.160]  iPhone 5. But, you know, at least two years of existing iPhones, you know, I think Tim Cook said to
[03:50.160 --> 03:55.760]  all right, there's at least 100 million people out there that already, even before the iPhone 6 hit,
[03:55.760 --> 04:04.160]  already owned an iPhone that's compatible with the watch. So, they didn't need to. Like, I think maybe
[04:04.160 --> 04:10.080]  if, you know, there's a story that came out this week that from the information that, you know,
[04:10.080 --> 04:16.480]  that Apple had been hoping to actually have the watch on sale this year, rather than just
[04:16.480 --> 04:20.720]  announcing it and hoping that it comes out early next year. Would they say they'd be lucky
[04:20.720 --> 04:27.280]  if it came out by Valentine's Day? Which is interesting, but not surprising to me. I mean,
[04:27.280 --> 04:32.400]  of course, they would rather have it come out sooner rather than later, you know, and like everything
[04:32.400 --> 04:39.360]  in all of us do, most things end up taking longer than we had hoped. Yeah, this is where we
[04:39.360 --> 04:43.360]  note that, well, we're running an hour late, which is fine, because I'm a writer too,
[04:43.360 --> 04:47.440]  is so I can appreciate, you know, you just need to wrap it up. But then I realized it's about
[04:47.440 --> 04:55.280]  Derek Jeter and I was much more conflicted in my emotions. Oh, that was the hold up waiting to start
[04:55.280 --> 05:00.880]  the podcast. Yes, which is fine. Actually, I appreciate Jeter and all that went down until you
[05:00.880 --> 05:05.840]  wrote in the article that it's been so long since the Yankees won. And, you know, I'm sitting here
[05:05.840 --> 05:10.720]  as Milwaukee Brewers fan. We've never won anything and just silently resenting you.
[05:10.720 --> 05:14.400]  Yeah, they really crept out this year too. Oh, it's so brutal.
[05:14.400 --> 05:18.480]  Aren't they, they were like 20 games over 500 at one point? I don't know. I don't know if
[05:18.480 --> 05:22.800]  was that many, but they, I mean, they had like a 10 game leader division or something. Yeah,
[05:22.800 --> 05:27.760]  it's, it's, it's, it's the brewers. Yeah, that's not talking about.
[05:31.520 --> 05:35.120]  But I do think it helped, though. And that's why, you know, I even said last week with Renee,
[05:35.120 --> 05:40.560]  it's why a month prior in August that I sort of hinted that I thought the watch would be
[05:40.560 --> 05:46.560]  announced in the September event is like, it's combined with the fact that they do kind of go
[05:46.560 --> 05:52.320]  along with each other. And if they were going to talk about like health kit and, you know,
[05:53.280 --> 06:00.960]  the M8 thing on the phone and fitness tracking, they certainly are companions, you know, siblings in
[06:00.960 --> 06:08.400]  that regard, you know, that the information that's going to fill up the health app is, you know,
[06:08.400 --> 06:11.760]  going to come from those two sources, going to come from the phones, going to come from the watch
[06:11.760 --> 06:20.560]  if you buy the watch. But it's also to me about how you set up the next event, which I expect to,
[06:20.560 --> 06:27.200]  you know, sometime in October, you know, as, as per the previous three years, where they'll do new
[06:27.200 --> 06:32.960]  eye pads and give you Yosemite a proper, you know, public unveiling.
[06:32.960 --> 06:39.440]  Right. And it would have definitely made even less, less sense there as I said, you've noted.
[06:40.080 --> 06:46.640]  I guess what's the more the thing is is like, I mean, so I've, I've haven't evolved
[06:47.280 --> 06:52.800]  position on the on the watch. I was initially quite critical. I thought I should much more focus
[06:52.800 --> 06:58.800]  and limited now. I think it's much more ambitious than I at first realized. And not only that,
[06:58.800 --> 07:02.240]  I think that's probably the right move to establish the category, which I'm sure we can get into
[07:02.240 --> 07:08.640]  in a little bit. But, but the fact that it was introduced with the phone only reinforced
[07:09.280 --> 07:15.920]  the sense that it's that it's a companion for the phone, but the event itself presented it that
[07:15.920 --> 07:19.680]  it wasn't. And so like, they're ended up being actually, I think more cognitive dissonance
[07:20.320 --> 07:25.360]  than than had it been at a separate event. He even maybe would have been awkward at another time,
[07:25.360 --> 07:30.960]  but here it was just, it was just kind of strange. And I think it almost, it muddied the message that
[07:30.960 --> 07:37.680]  I think they were sending. Yeah, I think so too. And I'm not sure whether that's a mistake or not.
[07:37.680 --> 07:42.880]  I feel like we have to wait and see how this plays out. And it may not hurt them at all.
[07:43.680 --> 07:50.560]  But I do think it was the, as the time goes by and I want to talk about this because I think it's
[07:50.560 --> 07:55.200]  been an interesting three weeks where no, no new information has actually come out, right? I mean,
[07:55.200 --> 07:59.840]  we don't have any more information than what Apple told us and published on Apple.com
[07:59.840 --> 08:10.640]  on Tuesday, September 9th. But I feel like a lot of us are understanding and expectations for the
[08:10.640 --> 08:16.160]  watch have changed significantly. You know, yours publicly, you know, from what you wrote initially to
[08:16.160 --> 08:22.640]  what you've published this week. In mind too, even, you know, even since from what I wrote a week
[08:22.640 --> 08:28.400]  after the event, you know, and I was listening to, I know there's another one that just came out
[08:28.400 --> 08:34.400]  today before I didn't get those into it. But I was listening to the last week's episode of ATP.
[08:35.280 --> 08:39.600]  And I thought that if, you know, I just assume that most people who listen to this show or
[08:39.600 --> 08:44.480]  there's a large overlap between the audiences. But if you, you know, there are only an occasional
[08:44.480 --> 08:51.920]  ATP listener episode 83 was a really good one for the watch because it was, to me, it was ATP
[08:51.920 --> 08:59.520]  at its best where the three of them were not agreement and in a lot of ways, no two of them were
[08:59.520 --> 09:05.520]  in agreement on a lot of the issues surrounding the watch, which I, you know, made for a great
[09:05.520 --> 09:12.560]  discussion. And they, they worked their way into and out of a whole bunch of the problems surrounding
[09:12.560 --> 09:18.400]  the watch and their understanding of it. So that was a good one. And there's a couple of points
[09:18.400 --> 09:23.760]  I thought of listening to it just that I want to talk to you about. No, I agree. It was a great one,
[09:25.040 --> 09:30.960]  especially a totally inside baseball when, when Casey took on Markle was a, was a highlight.
[09:30.960 --> 09:35.120]  Yeah, that was the irony of it was that I've done of the three, the one who I agreed with the most
[09:35.120 --> 09:41.200]  was Casey. I think Casey, Casey got it in a way that I'd feel like the other two didn't.
[09:42.400 --> 09:48.320]  Yeah, no, I agree. I mean, we're basically Markle was saying, how could you make an expensive item
[09:48.320 --> 09:54.560]  and Casey pointed out that Marco drives, you know, a custom imported M5, um, which, which I think
[09:54.560 --> 10:00.880]  is, is spot on. I mean, we, we go, I know both you and I have gone back to the car analogy
[10:00.880 --> 10:06.640]  on multiple occasions, just because it's, it's, it's such a great one. Like it makes, it makes so
[10:06.640 --> 10:13.200]  much sense. Like there is no quote unquote reason for a BMW to exist. There's no reason to drive
[10:13.200 --> 10:20.720]  an M5 on US highways. Um, but people do it and they do it because it's, it's giving them benefits
[10:20.720 --> 10:25.440]  beyond like the technology underneath it. It's, it's, it's about, it's more about utility.
[10:25.440 --> 10:30.000]  I, it's funny, like I just mentioned the jeter thing. I, I would imagine this is your argument
[10:30.000 --> 10:35.440]  for why people like Keith Oberman are wronged because I was jeter just on stats. I, I would,
[10:35.440 --> 10:39.200]  my, my, when we put words in your mouth, like there's a contention that there's more going on
[10:39.200 --> 10:44.880]  here than just what you can count with numbers. And it's absolutely the same sort of thing with
[10:44.880 --> 10:48.480]  any product, but particularly with something that you're, that you're wearing, that you're
[10:48.480 --> 10:53.200]  displaying to the world. There's so much more that goes into it than the actual technical utility
[10:53.200 --> 10:58.400]  of what it does or what it does not do. This is such a classic talk show because it keeps
[10:58.400 --> 11:02.560]  coming back to jeter in the Yankees. But I do. So I don't want to do it. We have so much
[11:02.560 --> 11:06.560]  watch stuff to talk about. And I know that there's a bunch of you out there who listen to who
[11:06.560 --> 11:10.400]  and the sports stuff comes up. You guys start like looking for fast forward buttons. So I'm not
[11:10.400 --> 11:16.720]  going to go sporty sports on it. But the, the, just of it is, so Keith Oberman is a, I like him.
[11:16.720 --> 11:21.200]  I'm a huge fan of his work. He's, but he's, you know, not really a straight news guy and maybe
[11:21.200 --> 11:26.160]  never really was, but he's more of like the, the TV equivalent of a sports columnist. He's an opinion
[11:26.160 --> 11:34.880]  guy. And he had a rant on his show on ESPN last week. More or less saying no, Derek Jeter is,
[11:34.880 --> 11:38.240]  you know, maybe a fine guy, but he's not one of the greatest players who's ever played the game.
[11:38.240 --> 11:43.840]  And everybody keeps going on and on about how one of the all time grades is retiring and that is
[11:43.840 --> 11:49.520]  not. And I, you know, not to put words in his mouth, but his argument came down to look, his stats,
[11:49.520 --> 11:56.640]  just, his stats are very, very good, but they are not all time great. And I, to me, it's exactly
[11:56.640 --> 12:03.520]  like the people, like the Android people who everything is about specs, you know, and it's
[12:03.520 --> 12:09.120]  had the A8 isn't that great because Jesus, it's still only dual core. We've been, you know,
[12:09.120 --> 12:14.640]  every, every top flight Android phone has been quad core since whenever, you know, they're up at
[12:14.640 --> 12:21.280]  two gigahertz and Apple's still downclocking them to one point, whatever gigahertz and, you know,
[12:21.280 --> 12:26.080]  only one gigabyte of RAM they've been on, you know, and on and on spec wise. And it's like, if that's,
[12:26.080 --> 12:33.280]  if you want to judge the iPhone compared to the HTC One or Samsung's Galaxy Note or the Galaxy
[12:33.280 --> 12:43.600]  Alpha, whatever it came out today, based on that classic tech review checklist style, you know,
[12:43.600 --> 12:51.680]  how fast is the CPU, how much RAM, what is the benchmark on this or that? You know, you're never
[12:51.680 --> 12:56.160]  going to get it. You're not going to get the difference between what Apple's trying to do and I
[12:56.160 --> 13:01.280]  think has largely succeeded year after year after year doing. You're not going to get it, you know,
[13:01.280 --> 13:04.880]  and I, you know, if that's the way your mind works, that's why you're an Android guy, you know,
[13:04.880 --> 13:09.200]  and you're happy for it. You know, I'm glad that, you know, Android is, is a successful
[13:09.200 --> 13:13.120]  that it is for you, but you, you know, you're, you're trying to judge the iPhone on the wrong thing,
[13:13.120 --> 13:16.560]  and that's exactly looking at Jeter that way. It's exactly the same way.
[13:17.760 --> 13:22.640]  No, I agree. And if I'm going to continue the Jeter thing just for a moment, I mean, I think I,
[13:23.680 --> 13:28.880]  I've come around on it for the same reason and like the defense is like one thing, right? Jeter's
[13:28.880 --> 13:34.000]  widely criticized for his defense and according to the stats, rightly so. He's, he's not like,
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.400]  he always makes the routine play and never makes mistakes, but he doesn't have great range
[13:38.400 --> 13:45.120]  as and get to as many balls as he can. Yet the most iconic Jeter play is a defensive play,
[13:45.920 --> 13:50.400]  where in the playoffs, you know, best of five series, the Yankees were losing two zero,
[13:50.400 --> 13:56.400]  and he makes this like totally just kind of random play to catch a misthrown ball and flip it
[13:56.400 --> 14:00.560]  to home play and get the guy out basically saving the game and saving the, saving the season.
[14:01.440 --> 14:07.760]  And, and what, what I like about that, and yes, it's, it's very cliche and it's almost too
[14:07.760 --> 14:16.160]  neat in some ways, but that's Jeter's career and a nutshell, I guess, is in the grand scheme of things,
[14:16.160 --> 14:20.400]  like the defensive measures like run saved or over average or something like that. I don't know
[14:20.400 --> 14:26.240]  exactly what the wording is, but that one run was worth like a thousand run saved in the,
[14:26.240 --> 14:31.440]  in the regular season. Right. And it was, it was a playoff game against the Oakland A's
[14:31.440 --> 14:38.080]  in, oh, jeez, 2003, 2001, 2001. Oh, yeah, yeah, 2001. Yeah, and the Yankees ended up,
[14:38.080 --> 14:41.840]  they didn't win the World Series that year actually, but it was, it was in that emotional,
[14:43.600 --> 14:48.080]  everything was pushed back a week because of 9-11 having occurred and, you know, that year,
[14:48.080 --> 14:56.400]  in New York, it was in Oakland, which is a crazy ballpark. And they were down to zero and
[14:56.400 --> 15:01.360]  is the best of five series. So if they lost that game, they were, they were done. Right. And it's,
[15:01.360 --> 15:07.280]  just, it, it, it, errant throw to home, you know, and it missed the cutoff guy who was supposed
[15:07.280 --> 15:11.600]  to be the first baseman and it, Jeter had no reason to be there. There's no reason for a short stop
[15:11.600 --> 15:17.840]  to ever be where Jeter was, but he was there. He saw it. He saw the play, you know, it's a great
[15:17.840 --> 15:22.160]  example. It's an absolute great example or, or look at the other two, to me, two of the other
[15:22.160 --> 15:27.200]  signature plays in Jeter's career, the two times that he went flying into the stands to catch
[15:27.200 --> 15:33.200]  foul balls. You know, there was, you know, the one time it's like his face got so busted out,
[15:33.200 --> 15:36.480]  he actually had to come out of the game. His face was all, you know, bloody. He looked like he'd
[15:36.480 --> 15:42.000]  been in a boxing match, but he made the catch, you know, I don't know. There's, he's made catches
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.920]  like that. You know, there's, there's footage of him, you know, you can watch it. You can, you know,
[15:45.920 --> 15:52.320]  look it up on YouTube and see him make big game playoff catches flying headfirst into the stands.
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.920]  You know, he's done it more than once. Most guys finish the whole career and never make a play
[15:57.920 --> 16:02.560]  like that. So I totally agree. You can't measure it by stats. This whole thing is a thing in sports
[16:02.560 --> 16:06.480]  in general, right? Because there's been a big statistical revolution in, in sports,
[16:07.440 --> 16:11.200]  breaking things down, particularly in baseball where it's actually works the best because
[16:11.200 --> 16:14.960]  baseball really is a one on one game. It's not really a team game in some ways.
[16:14.960 --> 16:22.080]  Right. And between the pitcher, pitcher and batter. And I, in many respects, it's been good. It's
[16:22.080 --> 16:29.120]  been good for teams. Teams that have adopted this approach have excelled. But like any sort of
[16:30.080 --> 16:37.600]  analytical based thing, it gives you an advantage briefly, but it's, it's, it's easily copied.
[16:37.600 --> 16:43.200]  So now almost everyone does it. And so the advantages are, are less, much less than they were
[16:43.200 --> 16:49.520]  previously. And what ends up mattering then. And you see this in, I think, probably more basketball
[16:49.520 --> 16:55.360]  that, which is the sport I fall more closely, um, that then at baseball is, uh, the importance
[16:55.360 --> 17:02.160]  of lots of the intangible stuff, like how a team works together, like how, how Shuff sifts back
[17:02.160 --> 17:06.080]  and forth. Um, so you had a team, you know, as you're like the Spurs winning the title,
[17:06.080 --> 17:10.560]  despite not being the strongest team on paper. And it's because there's clearly like something
[17:10.560 --> 17:17.120]  else going on. And, uh, and I think that's so much of that applies to, um, if you think about
[17:17.120 --> 17:23.040]  technology in general, previously in the 80s, um, in the 90s, uh, businesses were buying it. And the
[17:23.040 --> 17:28.000]  idea is someone, the person who buying it was different than the person who's using it. And that
[17:28.000 --> 17:33.360]  sort of scenario lends itself to feature lists lends itself to price competition because
[17:34.160 --> 17:38.960]  the user experience is completely divorced from the buying experience. Yeah. But now when it's more
[17:38.960 --> 17:44.240]  in the consumer space, all these intangible things, like what it's like to use it, how you feel
[17:44.240 --> 17:49.440]  when someone sees you put out your pocket, like all these little bits and pieces that you can't
[17:49.440 --> 17:56.640]  really measure become much more important. And as that's happened, Apple has benefited. And as
[17:56.640 --> 18:02.480]  devices have become more personal as devices have become with us more often Apple has benefited.
[18:02.480 --> 18:07.600]  And even something like a watch that's very visible and is with you all of the time, I mean,
[18:07.600 --> 18:12.560]  Apple, I would imagine is, is celebrating at the opportunity because it fits so well with their
[18:12.560 --> 18:18.720]  strengths. Yeah. I completely agree with that. I would say if you look at Apple, zoom out to the
[18:18.720 --> 18:25.920]  big picture and just look at them from the founding in 1976 to today, the miracle is that
[18:25.920 --> 18:32.000]  they survived until now. Right. You know, and, and now meaning, let's say that iPhone in 2000
[18:32.000 --> 18:37.600]  or even the iPod, let's, you know, because that's, that's the thing that turned them around. That
[18:37.600 --> 18:46.000]  they made it until 2001 when they could launch the iPod and start to make, you know, to really
[18:46.000 --> 18:53.600]  grow outside the tech world. I have a friend, a good friend, Matt, who's a fellow Yankees fan.
[18:53.600 --> 18:57.200]  I think he listens to the show. He's probably going to be thrilled. I'm talking about him. But he,
[18:57.200 --> 19:03.600]  when I first met him, he, he asked me when he knew I was a Yankees fan from reading, you know,
[19:03.600 --> 19:09.920]  during fireball. But his theory is that there's two types of sports fans, stats, stats fans,
[19:09.920 --> 19:16.800]  and story fans. And, you know, it's, it's, any time you try to say there's only two type of
[19:16.800 --> 19:20.480]  people, of course, there's a gray zone and, you know, some stats guys are a little bit
[19:20.480 --> 19:25.440]  into the story side and some story guys are still interested in some of the stats. I'm a story
[19:25.440 --> 19:31.280]  guy, though, in his telling where it's, I just don't get into the numbers that much, you know,
[19:31.280 --> 19:36.240]  and it's, I, I believe in clutch hitting. I believe in clutch performance. And I know that's one
[19:36.240 --> 19:42.320]  of the stats guys things, you know, like, you know, the, the baseball prospectus guys, Bill James,
[19:42.320 --> 19:46.480]  you know, there's a theory that they try to back up that there's no such thing as clutch
[19:46.480 --> 19:50.400]  hitting, you know, they know. And I say, you say there's no such thing as clutch hitting,
[19:50.400 --> 19:56.480]  and I say Derek Jeter. And I just don't see how you could deny it. So, for example,
[19:56.480 --> 20:01.360]  don't meet his spotlight. Right. And even though to back it up, but one of the, you know,
[20:01.360 --> 20:06.320]  the whole Jeter farewell thing is just chock full of all these statistics and stuff like that.
[20:07.200 --> 20:12.080]  But one of the most amazing ones is, and this is off the top of me. I'm not going to look it up,
[20:12.080 --> 20:20.320]  but it's, he's played 158 postseason games, which is, you know, in the whole regular baseball season
[20:20.320 --> 20:26.080]  is 162 games. And most guys would be lucky to play 158, you know, even players who aren't injured
[20:26.080 --> 20:32.000]  take a game off here and there. So he's played easily the equivalent of a full regular season,
[20:32.560 --> 20:40.000]  all postseason, which by definition is only against the very best pitchers and opposing teams.
[20:40.000 --> 20:43.600]  The, you know, every postseason game is against a team that was good enough to make it into
[20:43.600 --> 20:50.080]  postseason. And he's got like a 320 career postseason batting average, you know, enough that it would
[20:50.080 --> 20:55.920]  win a batting title most years. And that's, you know, in the postseason. No, that, that's really
[20:55.920 --> 21:01.840]  impressive because batting averages drop significantly in the postseason. Right. Because the pitching
[21:01.840 --> 21:06.800]  is so much better. So much better. It's, you know, it's, it's really that that's, that's the way
[21:06.800 --> 21:11.680]  to win, you know, postseason baseball games is to have amazing pitching. You know, it was like with the,
[21:11.680 --> 21:19.520]  uh, remember the White Sox, uh, when they won in 2000, I get the year wrong. Six one to the year.
[21:20.160 --> 21:25.440]  Whatever year it was that the, or whatever year the Chicago White Sox won a decade ago,
[21:25.440 --> 21:29.200]  they won the World Series in four games. They're four pitchers pitched four complete games.
[21:29.760 --> 21:34.640]  It was, it's, I'm believable. Like they had four pitchers who caught fire and were just
[21:34.640 --> 21:38.240]  un hitable. And they just went one, two, three, four World Series is over.
[21:38.240 --> 21:43.440]  Yeah, it's like having a hot goalie in, in hockey or something. You can just shut out everything
[21:43.440 --> 21:50.560]  else. And tech is exactly the same that there's story guys and stats guys and, you know, and
[21:50.560 --> 22:00.480]  the tech industry was so dominated by the stats, the specs for so long. Um, because it was only
[22:00.480 --> 22:06.320]  tech people effectively, you know, everybody using a computer was a tech person. For some reason,
[22:06.320 --> 22:11.040]  you know, that, that's, that was the, the problem Apple faced in 1984 with the Macintosh,
[22:11.040 --> 22:15.440]  is they'd build a computer, you know, quote unquote, for the rest of us. And there were
[22:15.440 --> 22:20.800]  times to us. Well, they had no interest in a computer, you know, it really kind of needed the
[22:20.800 --> 22:27.840]  computing world needed, uh, the internet and to make it a communications device, because that's
[22:27.840 --> 22:31.440]  something everybody wants to do. Everybody, you know, it's, it's being able to communicate
[22:31.440 --> 22:39.760]  that turn the computer into something regular people wanted. Um, and by that time it was, you know,
[22:39.760 --> 22:43.760]  it was too late. Windows had become entrenched and, you know, when everybody got on the internet,
[22:43.760 --> 22:49.200]  it was a Windows dominated world. Yeah, no, I think this is the key thing that every time you
[22:49.200 --> 22:55.360]  hear someone talk about Mac versus Windows, um, it, it actually had very little to do with the
[22:55.360 --> 23:01.600]  the underlying dynamics, it had to do with the external context and who was buying and all that,
[23:01.600 --> 23:06.640]  all that sort of stuff. And anyone who doesn't really talk about that, um, you can take,
[23:06.640 --> 23:10.960]  in my opinion, the, you know, they're opinion with a very large green assault, uh, because that,
[23:10.960 --> 23:16.720]  that the world was just so completely and utterly different than. And it, there's actually very
[23:16.720 --> 23:23.200]  few lessons to be drawn to today. Yeah. Um, the famous, I brought this up and it's, you know,
[23:23.200 --> 23:29.200]  maybe one of the all time claim childers of all time is a commander tacos reaction to the
[23:29.200 --> 23:37.760]  original iPod back in 2001 on slash dot. Um, here's his whole comment after Apple released the
[23:37.760 --> 23:46.800]  iPod, uh, no wireless, less space than a nomad lame. So it was all, you know, it was completely
[23:46.800 --> 23:51.040]  looking at it from the perspective. And we laugh at that in hindsight, right? That the original
[23:51.040 --> 23:57.920]  iPod was lame. Uh, but it, it was a rational perspective from the point of view of the type of
[23:57.920 --> 24:03.040]  people who read slash dot. Oh, for sure. I'm surprised. The only thing he forgot to put in was,
[24:03.040 --> 24:11.680]  was way too expensive. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Where maybe, you know, it's, uh, yeah, to hit the,
[24:11.680 --> 24:15.920]  the trifecta, you know, does last doesn't have wireless. We want, you know, everything to be
[24:15.920 --> 24:21.280]  wireless for whatever reason, less space than a nomad. Remember nomads? I mean, who even made
[24:21.280 --> 24:26.560]  that creative creative apps? Yeah, I had a diamond diamond was the other one that I had a diamond
[24:26.560 --> 24:33.760]  Rio. Um, but yeah, creative labs. They're the guys who sued Apple about the, uh, about the
[24:33.760 --> 24:38.240]  sound ship and the iPod. Actually one, I think that that, that single-handedly kept their company
[24:38.240 --> 24:43.600]  afloat for, I think they might still be around actually. I'm not sure. Um, but yeah, creative
[24:43.600 --> 24:49.920]  technologies out of Singapore. Right. Whereas the, you know, there was some amazing technology
[24:49.920 --> 24:56.880]  in that original iPod, uh, like the, the 1.8 inch hard drive. I think that's the size that it was,
[24:56.880 --> 25:02.400]  was a new thing. It was like nobody'd use it. And there's some great stories. I forget who
[25:02.400 --> 25:09.680]  published it originally, but it was, um, what was the name that guy who was the, uh, uh, he ended up at
[25:09.680 --> 25:18.880]  Palm. Yeah, Rubenstein. Rubenstein, right. John Rubenstein was, uh, engineering head at Apple at the time
[25:18.880 --> 25:26.560]  and, uh, was over in Asia, like scouting, you know, new stuff. And I think it was Toshiba who'd come
[25:26.560 --> 25:32.080]  up with these. And they were like, Oh, and we've got, we've done this. We've gone from 2.5 inch
[25:32.080 --> 25:39.360]  hard drives to 1.8 inch. And nobody wants to buy them because everybody's putting hard drives to the
[25:39.360 --> 25:47.120]  smallest thing. Anybody was putting hard drives into were laptops and laptops in 2001 or 2000,
[25:47.120 --> 25:53.760]  whatever year it was. Even the small ones, the difference between a 1.8 and a 2.5 inch hard drive
[25:53.760 --> 25:57.840]  didn't make a difference. And so why spend it? Why, you know, everybody told Toshiba, well, why
[25:57.840 --> 26:03.200]  would we spend all this money when we don't really need to save that space? Whereas, uh, Rubenstein
[26:03.200 --> 26:08.480]  looked at them and thought, that's it. That's the thing we can, you know, do this music thing with,
[26:08.480 --> 26:13.520]  to, you know, because 2.5 was way too big. Well, what's so interesting about this whole story actually
[26:13.520 --> 26:20.960]  is, um, it's very, it's a very, uh, unappled kind of story, which in some ways, the, the iPod is a
[26:20.960 --> 26:27.680]  bit of an unappled type product. Um, but basically, uh, in Jan, so Apple had a vision originally said,
[26:27.680 --> 26:31.600]  like, oh, we're going to be like about personal video. That's going to be the new, you know, desktop
[26:31.600 --> 26:36.400]  publishing. And then they're like, Oh crap, we missed the music boat. And then Steve Jobs came
[26:36.400 --> 26:40.080]  out and said, I actually are, we have a new strategy. It's called the digital hub strategy.
[26:40.080 --> 26:44.800]  Right. And, uh, the center and we're going to, and then the rest of the event where the event
[26:44.800 --> 26:50.480]  where he introduced the digital hub strategy was in January, 2001, in the same event, they introduced
[26:50.480 --> 26:55.520]  iTunes. And, uh, and they talked, and they spent the whole time talking about music. It was
[26:55.520 --> 27:01.600]  Rick McSburne was the, was kind of the catchphrase. And the thing is the iPod didn't exist at
[27:01.600 --> 27:06.880]  all. He didn't exist at Apple because John Rubenstein didn't go to Japan until February, the next
[27:06.880 --> 27:12.480]  month. Right. And it was when he was in Japan, he was introduced to or he saw the hard drive. And
[27:12.480 --> 27:17.840]  it was the hard drive that was the genesis for the iPod. And so it's actually, it's almost like
[27:17.840 --> 27:22.000]  completely backwards from the way we think about an Apple product being created. And so the,
[27:22.000 --> 27:27.440]  the original iPod is put together in like six months. Uh, and, and it was put together super fast.
[27:27.440 --> 27:33.440]  It was totally driven by the technology. But what came out was in a technological product. It was a,
[27:33.440 --> 27:38.640]  you know, it was a, it was a music player. And there's something like, it's very different to,
[27:38.640 --> 27:45.440]  to be a, to be a hard drive than is to be a music player. And it's that kind of transformation
[27:45.440 --> 27:52.960]  from a technological item to a something that you desire because it makes your life better that,
[27:52.960 --> 28:00.400]  that Apple's, that is Apple, that is what Apple is so good at. Yeah. Um, you know, we'll just
[28:00.400 --> 28:03.680]  get back to the watch. I'll, I'll take a break in a moment. We'll get back to the watch. But I do
[28:03.680 --> 28:07.520]  think you're right though. And I think you even mentioned this on a strategic read this week.
[28:07.520 --> 28:11.920]  Was it you who mentioned that the iPod was sort of an on Apple like product in hindsight?
[28:11.920 --> 28:17.680]  I think I mentioned it. Yeah. I think I did in the article about the watch. And it's worth keeping
[28:17.680 --> 28:24.160]  that in mind. I think thinking about what the watch is a going to be or what their intentions
[28:24.160 --> 28:28.560]  are. Is it an iPod on your wrist or is it something more? And I'm, I'm with you that I think
[28:28.560 --> 28:34.560]  it's something more. Yeah. I mean, I've, I've gotten tripped up by the iPod a few times in my
[28:34.560 --> 28:39.440]  analysis. Like last year, I originally said the phone would be much, much cheaper than it was
[28:39.440 --> 28:43.600]  because it's thinking about the iPod and how the iPod was always price competitive. Um,
[28:43.600 --> 28:48.000]  and I, you know, I did within a week, I think, and I think you chided me at the time. Uh,
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.720]  it said, no, actually, I think it's going to be pretty expensive. And it ended up being that
[28:51.280 --> 28:57.280]  basically the, the iPod was, it was always a basically an accessory. It was a single purpose
[28:57.280 --> 29:03.120]  device, a peripheral. Yes, exactly. That's the word. It was a peripheral that was very cost
[29:03.120 --> 29:09.200]  competitive. It was, it was done in an Apple way. It was simple. It was very well thought out.
[29:09.200 --> 29:14.640]  It had beautiful industrial design. But if you think about it, every other Apple product of note
[29:14.640 --> 29:21.280]  has been a platform that's been a general purpose computer. And the, the arc of Apple is to create
[29:21.280 --> 29:26.640]  a general purpose computer that's smaller and more attractive and more accessible than the
[29:26.640 --> 29:33.520]  competition. And everything fits in that arc, except for, except for the iPod. It's that,
[29:33.520 --> 29:38.880]  I don't think it makes any more sense than as a, as a typical Apple product doesn't make
[29:38.880 --> 29:46.000]  any more sense than if in some alternate universe, the quick take camera had really taken off,
[29:46.000 --> 29:51.440]  and that Apple had become a major player in digital photography. Yeah, which of course they are.
[29:51.440 --> 29:55.520]  Now that the phone is out, but you know what I mean? I mean, the quick take was amazing. I forget
[29:55.520 --> 30:00.320]  what year that came out in the 90s, but it was amazing. And it was one of the, it was super expensive
[30:00.320 --> 30:05.680]  compared to like film cameras, but it was one of the first digital cameras that was at least
[30:05.680 --> 30:11.520]  plausible for someone to own. And it was amazing. And it took like 320 by 320 pictures or something.
[30:12.720 --> 30:17.920]  But in some world, in some alternate universe, that could have become hit, especially, I think,
[30:17.920 --> 30:24.080]  if it did, you know, if jobs in his crew had gotten there a little earlier and cleaned up,
[30:24.080 --> 30:30.880]  you know, the product development at, like they eventually did, if it had been a little bit more of
[30:30.880 --> 30:38.320]  a jobsy Apple product than Scully era Apple product, it might have been. But it would have been
[30:38.320 --> 30:42.080]  weird for Apple to be selling something like a camera, but no more weird than it was that they
[30:42.080 --> 30:47.440]  played that they were selling a walk man. No, totally. No, I actually think the camera is a great
[30:47.440 --> 30:53.120]  example. I think the other example that's interesting in telling is the laser writer actually,
[30:53.120 --> 30:59.840]  where Apple actually was like one of the preeminent printer manufacturers in the world.
[31:01.200 --> 31:06.880]  But that was that they were never a printer company. Like that was, that was to enable the Mac,
[31:06.880 --> 31:11.680]  to like enable desktop publishing and all that sort of stuff. But I think both are,
[31:11.680 --> 31:19.760]  both are examples of in one a hit, one not so much, but of products Apple made, but by no means
[31:19.760 --> 31:25.520]  define the company. Nobody thinks Apple as a printer company. And it all comes back to the
[31:26.160 --> 31:31.040]  the story slash stats divide in the tech world where, you know, and again, this is super
[31:31.040 --> 31:36.320]  ancient history, the laser writer stuff. But my, you know, my understanding of that is Apple wanted
[31:36.320 --> 31:40.160]  others, they didn't even want to get into the printer business really. I mean, they, you know,
[31:40.160 --> 31:43.520]  they take the money and they sold them for a lot of money. But, you know, and they never, you know,
[31:43.520 --> 31:48.480]  when they eventually got out, there was nobody, nobody was pouring one out for the Apple printers,
[31:48.480 --> 31:52.320]  you know, it was never really the company's heart was never in it. But just if it was, they
[31:52.320 --> 31:56.560]  couldn't get other companies to make them. They were like, hey, you guys could build these laser
[31:56.560 --> 32:02.960]  printers. And yes, they'll be crazy expensive. But look at the output, we can do beautiful high
[32:02.960 --> 32:08.000]  resolution output. And everybody, you know, the industry was like, ah, dot matrix is good enough,
[32:08.000 --> 32:13.520]  you know, we don't need that, you know, and whereas the output was horrible from dot matrix
[32:13.520 --> 32:20.560]  printers. Yeah. It's absolutely horrible. You know, it's crazy to even think of that to compare
[32:20.560 --> 32:25.120]  them. But yeah, I mean, it's what's interesting though is yeah, the, I mean, it's the laser writer
[32:25.120 --> 32:31.040]  wasn't under looking at Wikipedia articles released the same day as page maker. And it was way
[32:31.040 --> 32:36.400]  more expensive than what was on the market. But it had Apple talk was that it would be used by
[32:36.400 --> 32:41.760]  multiple people so that per user cost was lower. Like, it's funny, you see almost all these
[32:41.760 --> 32:46.480]  characteristics of, of a typical Apple product wrapped up in a printer, which is kind of weird
[32:46.480 --> 32:51.600]  to think about. But I think the, the broad takeaway is, um, nobody thinks of Apple as a printer
[32:51.600 --> 32:56.480]  company. And I'm definitely not going to reference the laser writer when I think about analysis
[32:56.480 --> 33:02.480]  of the watch. Um, but on the same tone, I think I'm not sure you should be referencing the iPod
[33:02.480 --> 33:07.680]  when you think about analysis either. All right, let's take a break. And I think our first sponsor,
[33:07.680 --> 33:14.240]  brand new sponsor, uh, really excited to have it. It's a cool app for the Mac called you bar.
[33:15.040 --> 33:22.960]  That's the, like it, the lower case letter, you capital B for bar, you B AR, you bar. Um,
[33:23.680 --> 33:28.880]  it's a doc replacement for the Mac, a doc alternative, if you will, because you can't really replace
[33:28.880 --> 33:33.920]  the doc, um, but you can configure it in a whole bunch of ways. It's like a power user's
[33:33.920 --> 33:39.840]  doc. So you can configure it like a doc. It's like the Apple doc, but better, or you can use it
[33:39.840 --> 33:45.200]  a lot, some, and something that's more like a taskbar, like from Windows. Uh, so if you're a
[33:45.200 --> 33:49.520]  Windows convert and tasks bar from Windows is one of the things you really liked on Windows and you
[33:49.520 --> 33:54.400]  miss it, you bar is definitely the thing to look at. And even if you're a Mac user, but you've
[33:54.400 --> 33:59.920]  always thought that the Windows style taskbar, the way that you can minimize and, and, and organize
[33:59.920 --> 34:07.360]  Windows and stuff like that in apps is more to your liking, uh, also worth checking out. Um,
[34:07.360 --> 34:14.000]  all sorts of little touches, uh, the developer Edward Brower is, it's really, really focused on
[34:14.000 --> 34:19.680]  the details. His hobby, I've actually been emailing him. He's, uh, uh, his hobby is making mechanical
[34:19.680 --> 34:23.440]  watches, which is just funny that, you know, the timing that it's when we're talking about watches,
[34:23.440 --> 34:28.960]  but he does really, really amazing looking, uh, mechanical watches that he creates himself. Uh,
[34:28.960 --> 34:33.920]  and it's like that level of detail in you bar, like the kind of thing that you'd expect from
[34:33.920 --> 34:40.320]  somebody who's hobby is making high-end mechanical wrist watches. Uh, so badges, just, it's just one
[34:40.320 --> 34:46.560]  example of the sort of detail. The little red circles you get on an app icon. Uh, you bar does it
[34:46.560 --> 34:51.200]  in a way where no matter how many apps you have down there in the bar, the badge always stays at a
[34:51.200 --> 34:55.840]  size that's readable as opposed to Apple's method where they just turned into little red dots in the
[34:55.840 --> 35:02.480]  corner of the window and you can't read them. Uh, that's one example. Uh, he's got a thing called
[35:02.480 --> 35:08.480]  activity mode. You hold down the control key on your keyboard and all the app tiles, they switch
[35:08.480 --> 35:12.720]  from having their name underneath, which in itself is a difference from the Apple app or you can
[35:12.720 --> 35:17.200]  actually have like the name of the app, the name of the window that you've minimized down there.
[35:17.760 --> 35:23.040]  Uh, well, those names change when you hold down the control key and they show you CPU and RAM
[35:23.040 --> 35:29.600]  usage instead. So it's also a replacement for activity viewer. Uh, so if you feel like there's an app
[35:29.600 --> 35:33.200]  that may, you know, you're worried that this, which app is using the most CPU, just put your mouse
[35:33.200 --> 35:38.800]  over the, you bar, hold down the control key and it shows you exactly what's going on. Uh, sort of
[35:38.800 --> 35:43.840]  thing for everybody. No, of course not. Sort of thing for nerds who want to run activity monitor,
[35:43.840 --> 35:49.200]  awesome feature. Really, really cool. Uh, helps you kill anytime you have an app that gets wedged,
[35:49.200 --> 35:53.280]  just to sort of app that you have to force quit. Uh, you don't have to go hunting for it. It just
[35:53.280 --> 35:58.240]  shows you right there and you bar once an app is unresponsive. Uh, it gets like a special background
[35:58.240 --> 36:04.720]  color. So you can tell right away. Uh, plenty of custom, customizability tons of it. There's a dark
[36:04.720 --> 36:10.880]  theme like dark mode and Yosemite, a light theme, uh, that looks like the, the menu bar in Mavericks.
[36:11.680 --> 36:17.120]  Uh, you can add apps, files, you can have favorites that always show up instead of just showing you what's
[36:17.120 --> 36:25.120]  running. Uh, version 2.0 came out in July. It's already up to version 2.26. Uh, he's updating it
[36:25.120 --> 36:32.400]  regularly. It's really under heavy active development. Um, it bottom line, his goal is he's working
[36:32.400 --> 36:37.440]  to make this the doc replacement for OS 10. So if you're just sort of user who wants to replace your
[36:37.440 --> 36:45.680]  doc, you like tinkering with system utilities and stuff like that. Check out, uh, you bar. Um, normally
[36:45.680 --> 36:56.400]  sells for 20 bucks. Uh, but if you use the coupon code standard Gruber, all one word standard
[36:56.400 --> 37:06.240]  Gruber, you get 50% off. So meaning you can get it for just 10 bucks. Uh, and you can even better,
[37:06.240 --> 37:14.800]  you can, uh, run it in demo mode for four weeks. So you get four full weeks to try it out before
[37:14.800 --> 37:20.640]  you have to decide. Really cool utility. Uh, it's really well done. I think anybody who loves that
[37:20.640 --> 37:28.160]  sort of stuff to check it out. So, um, my thanks to you bar for sponsoring the show, save 10 bucks
[37:28.160 --> 37:38.000]  with coupon standard Gruber. Standard Gruber. I love that. I prefer common Gruber. Yeah. Maybe that
[37:38.000 --> 37:49.680]  would be next week's code. Just go to Brower Software dot com. That's B R A W E R S O F T W A R E dot
[37:49.680 --> 37:58.480]  com B R A W E R Brower Software dot com and, uh, find out more and use that coupon code and save, uh,
[37:58.480 --> 38:05.040]  half price, half price for talk show listeners. Great deal. So let's, let's go back and let's,
[38:05.040 --> 38:12.000]  it's, uh, just get into the watch. So you've had an evolved, uh, take on the watch. Like,
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.960]  you even mentioned earlier in the show that your initial take was that this, it was too unfocused
[38:18.000 --> 38:23.200]  and, and so start me down your pad. What was your initial take? Which I think I think your initial
[38:23.200 --> 38:27.360]  take represented an awful lot of people. No, for sure. I mean, it's one of the, it's one of the most
[38:27.360 --> 38:30.480]  popular articles I had in quite a while, which, which is funny because people like, oh, you just
[38:30.480 --> 38:35.680]  changed your mind. Well, well, like, no, actually the feedback was very, was very positive in favor
[38:35.680 --> 38:41.280]  of that piece. I'm not, I'm not winning any brownie points by, by, by switching. Um, basically,
[38:41.280 --> 38:46.160]  uh, my criticism was primarily about the event. I mean, because I, I, uh, I wasn't there. I,
[38:46.160 --> 38:51.040]  and obviously, people were there, couldn't use the watch. So it's, it's hard to get too much into
[38:51.040 --> 38:57.360]  the actual details. But the event in general, I compared and contrasted it to previous new product
[38:57.360 --> 39:05.760]  introductions. So going back to the iPod, going back to the iPhone and the iPad, uh, in all three
[39:05.760 --> 39:14.720]  cases, uh, Steve Jobs did a bit of exposition, uh, about why this product needed to exist,
[39:14.720 --> 39:19.760]  you know, and what's the market? What's, what's the problem people have? What's out there? Oh,
[39:19.760 --> 39:24.320]  and here's our new thing and it happens to fit the market and take care of problems and,
[39:24.320 --> 39:30.560]  and all that sort of thing. Um, so that didn't happen with the watch. What happened with the
[39:30.560 --> 39:35.840]  watches? Tim Cook got on stage and he said, Oh, here's the next door, you know, we're very excited.
[39:35.840 --> 39:40.320]  We've been working very hard. Here's the next, the next chapter and Apple story and then boom,
[39:40.320 --> 39:44.160]  a video popped up. You know, like it was, it was a great video. Um, you know, showing the
[39:44.160 --> 39:50.160]  initials on the watch and then it pops on screen and was like, ooh, uh, but that, that piece about
[39:50.160 --> 39:56.640]  why does this exist where in the market as a goal was, was missing. And that was, that I was
[39:56.640 --> 40:04.000]  concerning to me. And it was, that concern was amplified by the software demo, which to my mind,
[40:04.640 --> 40:10.880]  um, again, going into the event, I was thinking this was, this was an accompaniment to the iPhone.
[40:10.880 --> 40:14.400]  That's why it was being introduced with the iPhone. This was my thinking going into it.
[40:14.400 --> 40:18.160]  And in that light, I'm like, why are they doing a demo that doesn't leverage the iPhone?
[40:18.160 --> 40:22.000]  Like, they were searching for movies on the watch. They were looking at all these photos on the
[40:22.000 --> 40:26.240]  watch. Like, well, if you have an iPhone in your pocket, why won't you use that to do this sort of
[40:26.240 --> 40:33.760]  stuff? And so I, I'm like, this demo is kind of weird. They didn't say why, uh, this has me a little
[40:33.760 --> 40:40.880]  worried about the, about the whole concept. Yeah, I just completely agree. So why would I want to buy
[40:40.880 --> 40:48.160]  this? Yeah, why, why, why, what, what, you know, what is the job to be done to use the, the, I was
[40:48.160 --> 40:53.760]  going to say, Horace, but I guess he took that from Clay Christensen. Yeah, Clay Christensen, but,
[40:53.760 --> 40:58.720]  you know, it's just a way to put it in context. But yeah, what, what, what are you hiring the watch to
[40:58.720 --> 41:05.840]  do? And I don't think they answered that. But, and I'm, again, a time will tell on this front.
[41:05.840 --> 41:15.120]  It's either a sign that that they have lost focus post jobs. And it is the first, you know,
[41:15.120 --> 41:18.640]  we're either going to look back at that introduction event as the first warning sign
[41:19.360 --> 41:25.440]  that Apple is in trouble and is going to, it isn't going to do the same good job with a new,
[41:25.440 --> 41:32.160]  an altogether new product as they did before. Or it'll be forgotten. And it was, because it was,
[41:32.160 --> 41:37.920]  it was on purpose. Yeah, well, it's either, it's either one or the other, either they purposefully
[41:37.920 --> 41:44.560]  left it largely mysterious. And they're going to save that why for what I presume to be the event
[41:44.560 --> 41:49.680]  in January or February, where they're going to say, okay, now it's going on sale. And here's
[41:49.680 --> 41:56.960]  everything you need to know about it. All the prices, all the features, here's what the STK can do,
[41:56.960 --> 42:02.000]  you know, all of that stuff is going to come in a separate event. And that they did this sort
[42:02.000 --> 42:09.680]  of teaser event, first strategic reasons that will be clear after the watch actually comes out.
[42:10.880 --> 42:15.760]  Because that's the best, to me, that's the best way. It's like the difference between a preview
[42:15.760 --> 42:19.520]  that's supposed to tell you everything you need to know to make you want to go see this movie,
[42:19.520 --> 42:25.840]  or a teaser that's just supposed to put the movie into your head. That's a, that's a,
[42:25.840 --> 42:30.160]  that's a good analogy to think about it. I think there's also another explanation too,
[42:30.160 --> 42:36.640]  I mean, I think it's possible in January, it's even not, not as clear as it could be. And the
[42:36.640 --> 42:44.800]  reason that is, is, um, you know, actually, I cheated when I did that new product introduction,
[42:44.800 --> 42:50.560]  because I didn't include the Mac. And I actually, I did go back and watch the Mac event,
[42:50.560 --> 42:57.040]  but it didn't, it didn't fit as neatly because the, if you actually, if you go back, the Mac
[42:57.040 --> 43:03.680]  introduction was almost identical to the watch introduction. It was, job saying, we've been working
[43:03.680 --> 43:09.040]  super hard, this sort of thing. And then like there's this long, like, what's the, what's the,
[43:09.040 --> 43:16.640]  what's the song, you know, the, duh duh duh. And suck, suck. I forget the name. I think it's,
[43:16.640 --> 43:20.480]  I know it's a fire or something like that. Um, oh, no, that right, right. It wasn't the,
[43:20.480 --> 43:24.800]  the one from 2001. It was the Terry, it's a fire song. Yeah. I think that I think so. I don't remember
[43:24.800 --> 43:30.320]  the video watch actually was, um, I think for copyright reasons, like the, all the music was taken
[43:30.320 --> 43:35.120]  out. But if I recall, that's what it was. And then he pulls out, you know, it reveals the,
[43:35.120 --> 43:40.160]  reveals the Mac. Like it was very, it's funny. Like it would actually ended up being a lot like
[43:40.160 --> 43:45.440]  the watch. Um, and I'm not sure that's a great precedent. Obviously in the long run, the Mac
[43:45.440 --> 43:49.040]  turned out well, but as we just discussed, it had a bit of a struggle at the beginning.
[43:49.040 --> 43:56.560]  But at the same time, um, if, if you look back at the iPhone, nothing in that event was actually
[43:56.560 --> 44:02.400]  very pertinent to the way we use iPhones today. And that didn't make the event a bad event. It
[44:02.400 --> 44:08.160]  remains an amazing event. Um, you know, it's kind of like Steve Jobs is like all time, you know,
[44:08.160 --> 44:13.760]  all, on the all time great hit list. It's, it's number one. Uh, but at the same time, when you're
[44:13.760 --> 44:20.080]  creating a platform, when you're creating a new thing that, that is going to create all kinds
[44:20.080 --> 44:25.280]  of new opportunities, it's almost by definition impossible to know at the beginning what,
[44:25.280 --> 44:28.320]  what that's all going to be. Remember, I mean, Steve Jobs, I know there's confused, there's
[44:28.320 --> 44:32.240]  contention if Steve Jobs did or didn't want the app store. I'm in the camp that believes he did not
[44:32.240 --> 44:37.760]  want it. He thought that Apple could meet all the needs that the phone ought to serve when actually
[44:37.760 --> 44:43.200]  that, that wasn't even close to being true. And I think there's a way to look at this watch event
[44:43.200 --> 44:46.800]  and that Apple, maybe they didn't articulate as well as they could have, but they're, they're
[44:46.800 --> 44:52.720]  now realized that they know that we create platforms. There's no way we can ever even fully know
[44:52.720 --> 44:58.400]  what this is going to do. And, but we've created the foundation for something really great.
[44:59.600 --> 45:06.080]  I'm of the opinion. I think it's pretty clear he didn't want an app store in 2008, which is when
[45:06.080 --> 45:13.680]  the actual app store came out. I think that his, I think he, I think that he must have known
[45:13.680 --> 45:18.720]  that eventually they would do it. But I think that he thought it was a, this does not need to be a
[45:18.720 --> 45:23.920]  top priority for the next year. You know, we've got so many things to do. You know, this first
[45:24.640 --> 45:29.760]  phone is so, you know, has so much room for improvement. The last thing we need to worry about is
[45:29.760 --> 45:34.480]  the app store SDK angle. Right. And all the limitations that imposes on you. And
[45:34.480 --> 45:40.320]  right. I think that if you had had, if we could go back in time and have a honest discussion with
[45:40.320 --> 45:47.200]  Steve Jobs in the summer of 2007, you know, and people had started jailbreaking, you know, I mean,
[45:47.200 --> 45:52.160]  like in July, I mean, like weeks after the thing came out, like to me, that's still, it's one of
[45:52.160 --> 46:00.800]  the great things in, in indie Mac development history was the, the way that, you know, the first
[46:00.800 --> 46:04.160]  couple of developers who jumped on that. I mean, like the first version of Twitter
[46:04.160 --> 46:11.040] ific was written before there was a, an SDK, like Hock and Barry had a version, a Twitter
[46:11.040 --> 46:20.000]  client running on the iPhone before there was an SDK. I love that. But the demand, it was just,
[46:20.000 --> 46:25.840]  I think he just underestimated how badly the people who became indie iOS developers wanted to
[46:25.840 --> 46:31.440]  be able to do that. When I do think you're right too, that he, you know, is the nature of his
[46:31.440 --> 46:35.840]  personality was such that he assumed that his, what he wanted the phone to do was what most people
[46:35.840 --> 46:42.400]  would want it to do and it would cover a broader swath of, you know, why people would want it.
[46:42.400 --> 46:46.320]  And that's what's so interesting about this is a lot of the people who are disagreeing with me
[46:46.320 --> 46:52.400]  now. So my position now, like has evolved to the, I don't think Apple is making an accessory.
[46:52.400 --> 46:56.800]  I think they're making a new platform. A lot of people would disagree with that,
[46:57.760 --> 47:02.480]  want, want the Apple defined vision. They want it super clear on what it's going to do.
[47:03.040 --> 47:08.480]  But, and they, and they reference again, I did the same thing. So I'm not like by any means
[47:08.480 --> 47:13.360]  criticizing, I think it's a very valid point of view. They reference kind of like the iPhone,
[47:13.360 --> 47:20.320]  but the Steve Jobs' vision for the iPhone ended up being too small in a lot of ways.
[47:20.320 --> 47:24.720]  I mean, that's, that's not true in a big sense, but in this kind of narrow sense
[47:24.720 --> 47:31.520]  about what ought to run on it and when you ought to enable all that stuff to run on it.
[47:32.800 --> 47:39.360]  And not just, not just too small in the 3.5 inch diagonal. Like too small in the conceptual sense.
[47:39.360 --> 47:48.400]  Right, exactly. And, and, you know, it's a great for all, for the kind of pining that this sort of
[47:48.400 --> 47:54.960]  talk can inspire for Steve Jobs and for his way of interesting products. And the way he was
[47:54.960 --> 47:59.200]  such a master, you know, it's textbook. Like this isn't like particular Steve Jobs. He just did
[47:59.200 --> 48:04.640]  it better than anybody else. Like he was the best salesman in the world. Like, you have this problem,
[48:04.640 --> 48:08.720]  oh, you're right. I do have that problem. Look at the competition. They don't really work, man.
[48:08.720 --> 48:12.160]  Yeah, they all suck. Oh, look, wouldn't it be great if there was something that man,
[48:12.160 --> 48:15.840]  oh, your needs. That'd be awesome. Oh, look, we need to do this. Here's my money. Take it, right?
[48:15.840 --> 48:24.880]  I mean, he just walked you through that so perfectly. And I do think that's in some ways missing.
[48:24.880 --> 48:29.200]  But at the end of the day, the needs he ended up selling weren't the ones that were actually
[48:29.200 --> 48:35.520]  key to the product or what made it wildly, broadly successful. Yeah. But they were good enough to get
[48:35.520 --> 48:40.720]  it off the ground. I mean, and you know what, those, those things are still reflected in the
[48:40.720 --> 48:50.480]  default dock of the iPhone today, right? The Steve Jobs iPod iPhone. I say iPod, I said iPod,
[48:50.480 --> 49:00.880]  but I'm in iPhone. The dock, the four apps at the bottom, phone, mail, Safari, and it was called
[49:00.880 --> 49:06.160]  iPod back then. That's where I started getting tripped up and now it's music. That's what he wanted,
[49:06.160 --> 49:12.960]  right? He wanted a device that would play his music and it would be his cell phone and he could throw
[49:12.960 --> 49:18.480]  out whatever piece of garbage from Motorola he was using at the time. He could do his email and he could
[49:18.480 --> 49:23.600]  browse the web. And there you go. There's the product. And that was awesome. That alone would have been
[49:23.600 --> 49:28.400]  enough. Right. And the thing is, is like, I think Apple, but it wouldn't have been enough. It would
[49:28.400 --> 49:32.960]  have been enough to make it a compelling product. It would not have been enough to make it a world
[49:32.960 --> 49:38.560]  changing product, which is what it has eventually become. Right. No, that's exactly it. And I think
[49:39.760 --> 49:46.000]  the reason why, and this is what makes the watch interesting, is Apple actually in some ways has
[49:46.000 --> 49:49.440]  has some of those pieces there. Like there's a slide where Tim Cook has like the three things,
[49:49.440 --> 49:54.480]  like it's a great time piece. It's health and fist fitness and it's like the most personal
[49:54.480 --> 49:58.880]  communications device or something. I think those are the three items. The fact that I can't
[49:58.880 --> 50:07.920]  remember it quickly is indicative. Yeah. Now the personal, well, maybe the personal communication,
[50:07.920 --> 50:12.080]  right? The three things that they're kind of selling to watch on at the event this month,
[50:12.080 --> 50:20.960]  the weather, fitness tracking, time telling, yep. And the personal communication.
[50:20.960 --> 50:27.440]  Well, the thing is those like, I mean, even more so than the phone, like the use case for the
[50:27.440 --> 50:32.240]  phone was so obvious, right? Just to make a better, just to make a better phone would have been
[50:32.240 --> 50:39.600]  enough to sell a lot. Just to make a better Nike fuel band is not enough to sell a lot,
[50:40.240 --> 50:45.600]  because the, you're not the same with the iPod, just to make a better music player was enough
[50:45.600 --> 50:51.280]  to sell a lot, because what was the alternative to carry your computer around? Like the alternative
[50:51.280 --> 50:57.360]  was, was a non starter. The alternative to a watch is to use the phone in your pocket. Like the,
[50:57.360 --> 51:06.880]  the competition for even considering buying a watch in the first place is far steeper today than
[51:06.880 --> 51:12.160]  it was for any, any product, except for maybe the iPad is probably the best, is probably the
[51:12.160 --> 51:15.920]  best comparison here. Like why would you buy an iPad if you already, if you already have a Mac?
[51:15.920 --> 51:22.400]  And so for that reason, I, this is the biggest thing that changed my mind. Like I think Apple
[51:22.400 --> 51:27.920]  releasing a focused product would have meant a niche product that would never get great traction
[51:27.920 --> 51:32.720]  because it would never be the Delta over just pulling a phone in your pocket would have never
[51:32.720 --> 51:37.200]  been great enough. Like they needed a swing for the fences and it's probably raising risk, right?
[51:37.200 --> 51:41.280]  But the way you get a great return is by taking on greater risk. And I think that's what Apple's
[51:41.280 --> 51:49.840]  done. I very, very, very much in agreement with that. I think. Well, is your piece actually your
[51:49.840 --> 51:55.840]  phone piece that triggered this particular realization? So I'm glad to hear your in agreement.
[51:55.840 --> 52:01.760]  Wait, which phone piece? The, the observations on initial observations on the phone, basically
[52:01.760 --> 52:07.920]  you kept, you kept referring to the fact that if Apple would have only done like notifications
[52:07.920 --> 52:11.440]  and trackative advice, you'd been worried about the future of the company or something along those
[52:11.440 --> 52:17.200]  lines. Like I'm like, why is he being so hyperbolic? And then I basically thought about it and was
[52:17.200 --> 52:22.400]  like, well, that trigger, that's what triggered me thinking through. Like what if they only did
[52:22.400 --> 52:26.320]  this? What would be the implications of that? And that was my piece this week. Like if they only did
[52:26.320 --> 52:32.960]  that, there would actually be a lot of long term negative effects from limiting the potential
[52:32.960 --> 52:37.680]  of the platform to limiting the potential market. All of which should be bad for, very bad for
[52:37.680 --> 52:43.280]  Apple. And which is why I think they rejected that approach. And I presume was your, your thinking
[52:43.280 --> 52:51.520]  as well. Yeah, I think so. A little thing, just a side note. One thing that they've said publicly,
[52:52.400 --> 52:58.080]  I think they said it at the event or at least they said it after the event in like on the record
[52:58.080 --> 53:03.840]  statements, not like off the record. And then I think Tim Cook repeated it in his interview with
[53:03.840 --> 53:10.880]  Charlie Rose, which was excellent, really, really interesting. Just one of the best interviews I've
[53:10.880 --> 53:18.720]  ever seen with anybody related to Apple ever. But they came out and said that they've been working
[53:18.720 --> 53:26.160]  on this for three years. And they never ever say stuff like that. They are super secretive about
[53:26.160 --> 53:30.400]  how long they've been working on stuff. They never said how long they were working on the iPhone.
[53:30.400 --> 53:37.520]  And it took years and stuff that was, I think mostly off the record for it to come out that the way
[53:37.520 --> 53:42.880]  that the iPhone came about was that they were working on a tablet. And the tablet got pretty cool.
[53:42.880 --> 53:48.880]  And then they had this moment where they were like, wait a second, screw this tablet size for now.
[53:48.880 --> 53:55.120]  Let's take this tech and shrink it. Can we shrink it to, to be a phone? Boom, there's the phone.
[53:55.120 --> 53:58.160]  They don't, they don't, they never talked about that. They didn't talk because they don't want
[53:58.160 --> 54:04.800]  people to know how they were. Right. There's something part of the new Tim Cook Apple is the simple
[54:04.800 --> 54:09.200]  fact that they said that they've been working on this for three years. And I can't help but think
[54:09.200 --> 54:16.720]  that part of that is that they kind of want to say this whole thing is after Steve because
[54:16.720 --> 54:23.200]  three years is how long ago Steve Jobs died. Like, I don't think that's a coincidence that they're
[54:23.200 --> 54:28.800]  saying that publicly. And it's a way of saying that I think it's a sign of their confidence in the
[54:28.800 --> 54:33.440]  watch, but they're setting it up in advance that they think this thing is, they're onto something.
[54:33.440 --> 54:38.400]  They think it's going to be huge. And they don't want people to say, wow, Betsy of Jobs invented
[54:38.400 --> 54:42.080]  is probably the last thing he invented. Now show me something that you can invent, you know,
[54:42.080 --> 54:45.600]  without Steve Jobs. That's interesting. Yeah, it makes total sense.
[54:46.720 --> 54:52.080]  So for example, I remember when I got to take that antenna tour after an antenna gate and they took
[54:52.080 --> 54:59.280]  a bunch of us back into their antenna testing lab and we got to see, you know, these cool
[55:00.640 --> 55:06.800]  chambers where they test these things. I forget the guy's name, but they antenna engineer
[55:06.800 --> 55:10.960]  who and he led the tour and he was a little nervous. He did great, but he was a little nervous
[55:10.960 --> 55:14.960]  because he's just not used to speaking to the press. He's, you know, he's an Apple employee. He's
[55:14.960 --> 55:21.120]  just the last thing he does to speak to the press. And you know, a week prior, you know, he had no
[55:21.120 --> 55:26.880]  idea. It was like this antenna thing blew up and within the course of a week, now here he is leading
[55:26.880 --> 55:34.880]  20 people around Apple's, you know, lab. And Shiller and Katie Cotton were part of the group too,
[55:34.880 --> 55:39.760]  but they, you know, just were walking around sort of supervising. And somebody asked at one point,
[55:40.960 --> 55:47.280]  they were talking about the external antenna design, which was brand new on the iPhone 4.
[55:47.280 --> 55:53.040]  Nobody else had ever done it. And initial reaction from a whole bunch of people was, well, that's a
[55:53.040 --> 55:58.560]  stupid idea. The reason nobody else does that is it's a bad idea. And then the antenna gate thing came
[55:58.560 --> 56:02.880]  up. And they said, hey, touch it here and you lose yourself on. And they were like, see, told you,
[56:02.880 --> 56:07.360]  terrible idea Apple is, you know, terrible engineering company blah, blah, blah, blah.
[56:07.360 --> 56:11.200]  Well, we were talking about it with him on the tour and somebody, I don't know, but, you know,
[56:11.200 --> 56:16.560]  one of the writers asked, well, how long have you guys been working on that antenna design?
[56:16.560 --> 56:21.280]  And he was going to answer honestly. And Shiller immediately jumped in and said, we're not going
[56:21.280 --> 56:25.680]  to talk about how long we've been working on the antenna design. I mean, like, just cut them right
[56:25.680 --> 56:31.360]  off. It was sort of an awkward moment. Because that was something they did not want to say,
[56:31.360 --> 56:35.760]  you know, they wanted to say how the, you know, this antenna is actually, is a good design.
[56:35.760 --> 56:41.040]  Trust us, you know, this is going to work out this, this issue with the attenuation when you touch
[56:41.040 --> 56:46.480]  it at the wrong spot. It's a real thing, but it's not that big a deal. But there was no way that they
[56:46.480 --> 56:50.480]  were going to mention how long that this guy had been working on an external antenna design.
[56:51.760 --> 56:56.320]  Yeah, that's interesting. I'll rub it. And that's just the antenna design, let alone saying,
[56:56.320 --> 57:01.520]  you know, we've went from scratch to a shipping I watch in three or Apple watch in three years.
[57:02.400 --> 57:07.200]  Yeah, no, for sure. I mean, the, the whole Apple PR thing's interesting. It's funny you mentioned
[57:07.200 --> 57:13.200]  the tour of the labs. Um, I wrote about this in my, in my daily update this week where that,
[57:13.200 --> 57:20.080]  that, that, that was a good 22 days, I think, after the antenna gate story first broke on,
[57:20.080 --> 57:27.360]  on Gizmodo of all places. Uh, whereas this week, two days after the bent iPhone story broke,
[57:27.360 --> 57:31.440]  they were already getting people tours of the labs. Uh, I think they really learned their lesson
[57:31.440 --> 57:33.920]  on getting ahead, getting ahead of such things.
[57:33.920 --> 57:38.880]  Yeah, that's, should we take, should we take a, should we interrupt the watch to talk about
[57:38.880 --> 57:45.600]  Ben, Ben Gazi, Ben Gate? Uh, I mean, I, I think antenna gate is probably the best way to think
[57:45.600 --> 57:51.680]  about it. I mean, the iPhone 4 was on sale until, I think a week ago when it sold hundreds of
[57:51.680 --> 57:55.680]  millions of units. Right. Um, and I think that's pretty much all that needs to be said. I mean,
[57:55.680 --> 58:02.000]  the idea that Apple would not, would not be aware or have tested this sort of thing is preposterous
[58:02.000 --> 58:09.360]  and given their track record, uh, I, very willing to do them better for the doubt. And then I
[58:09.360 --> 58:15.040]  got, as someone who's criticized Apple in, in various forums, like I'm not, it's, it's preposterous
[58:15.040 --> 58:21.200]  to suggest that they didn't know or didn't have a particular tolerance that, that. The reason,
[58:21.200 --> 58:27.840]  the reason it takes any hold though is that it plays into the misconception stereotype of Apple,
[58:27.840 --> 58:33.920]  right, that they would do something like make an antenna design that looks awesome and save space
[58:33.920 --> 58:37.840]  to make the device thinner, but then have it not even be able to make phone calls. Like that's
[58:37.840 --> 58:44.960]  the worst, you know, the worst stereotype of Apple you could imagine. Um, and it's such a delicious
[58:44.960 --> 58:52.880]  soundbite, you know, world famous, uh, iPhone, new, new model can't make phone calls. It sounds
[58:52.880 --> 58:57.760]  so amazing. And then that, you know, it's, it's the perfect type thing for broadcast, right? The TV
[58:57.760 --> 59:05.120]  people really are the ones that made that catch fire. Um, and the bend thing is exactly the same,
[59:05.120 --> 59:13.200]  you know, Apple so desperately, you know, uh, or not desperate, but uh, uh, over interested,
[59:13.200 --> 59:18.800]  obsessed with making devices thinner made a phone so thin that it bends when you put in your pocket.
[59:18.800 --> 59:25.520]  Right. No, I think I, I think the, the key thing too is, uh, as you just said, like, there
[59:25.520 --> 59:30.240]  wasn't an antenna issue. It just, it's just an issue of, and so when the Verizon iPhone came out
[59:30.240 --> 59:36.240]  six months later, uh, there was a different antenna design. And so like, it's not to say that
[59:36.240 --> 59:41.200]  there's not a problem. I don't think either of us are saying that. I mean, clearly, um, you know,
[59:41.200 --> 59:45.920]  Matt, Matt honed in a thing and wired in his, his phone bent and I have no reason to,
[59:45.920 --> 59:52.160]  to doubt him. Uh, but at the same end, so I would imagine if the six plus s or whatever it's going
[59:52.160 --> 59:58.000]  to be called next year comes out that there's going to be something slightly different in the chassis
[59:58.000 --> 1:00:02.240]  or even right now that I'm making changes now to, to, to restrict it. But at the same time, like
[1:00:02.240 --> 1:00:08.560]  there's, there's a, there's a very wide canyon between, there are very isolated circumstances where
[1:00:08.560 --> 1:00:13.840]  this might happen to, oh my God, the house sun fire that's coming down. Right. And I think that's,
[1:00:13.840 --> 1:00:21.600]  that's what's so frustrating about, about these sort of gates. Yeah. Well, it's, it's that,
[1:00:21.600 --> 1:00:28.080]  that, that, that adage that, uh, it requires an order of more of a magnitude more effort to
[1:00:28.080 --> 1:00:34.480]  refute bullshit than it does to create it. It's so hard. It's the fact that it's bullshit that
[1:00:34.480 --> 1:00:41.200]  makes it so hard to refute, you know, like comparing contrast with the, the 8.01 iOS update that,
[1:00:41.200 --> 1:00:46.080]  that effectively bricked a bunch of iPhone sixes. I mean, I think Apple said that it
[1:00:46.080 --> 1:00:50.480]  affected about and wound up, it was out in a wild and wound up affecting like 40 or 50,000
[1:00:51.120 --> 1:00:57.360]  phones, uh, which is, I guess, good compared to the, you know, 200 million people using iPhones in
[1:00:57.360 --> 1:01:03.920]  the world, but still 40 or 50,000 people who just within the last, uh, week have spent upwards of
[1:01:03.920 --> 1:01:08.640]  six, seven, eight hundred dollars on a new phone had a software update that rendered their phone
[1:01:08.640 --> 1:01:13.360]  unusable. Uh, and there was a solution. They didn't have to take it back. It wasn't like the phones
[1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:16.880]  were permit, you know, you just had to go through a hassle of downloading it in iTunes and
[1:01:16.880 --> 1:01:22.480]  syncing it to a PC. And I'm sure that's actually also above beyond the technical Ken of many
[1:01:22.480 --> 1:01:27.520]  users. And so some people probably did have to go to a store, you know, go to an Apple store and get
[1:01:27.520 --> 1:01:33.520]  it fixed. Uh, but it was a real issue. It was a real problem. It was an actual botched iOS update,
[1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:38.240]  and Apple, you know, issued a statement that said, we're really sorry. We screwed this up.
[1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:44.400]  This was terrible. Sorry. We're working on a fix as fast as we can. Sorry. Do we, do we mention
[1:01:44.400 --> 1:01:49.920]  that we're sorry? And it was over, you know, that's it. It was a real issue. They dealt with it.
[1:01:49.920 --> 1:01:56.400]  Everybody kept it in perspective because it was real, right? And it's, I don't know. I said this
[1:01:56.400 --> 1:02:00.720]  with Marco before, because I know Marco, I think his wife had this problem, but with the iPhone 4,
[1:02:00.720 --> 1:02:06.480]  there was an actual really bad technical problem, which was the, the sensors that, you know,
[1:02:06.480 --> 1:02:12.560]  the ones that, when you hold it up to your face. Remember that, it was, they did not work correctly
[1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:18.080]  at all. And that was a real thing. And it was really affecting people with the phone. And there was
[1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:25.280]  nothing you could do, you know, it's, you know, it was a real thing. And it got like one 1,000th
[1:02:25.280 --> 1:02:31.680]  the publicity that the antenna thing did, you know, and meanwhile, like you said, the iPhone 4
[1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:38.000]  was on sale until two weeks ago in some parts of the world. GSM did not the Verizon one, the GSM
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:45.120]  iPhone 4 with an absolutely unchanged antenna layout was on sale until last week. It sold, you know,
[1:02:45.120 --> 1:02:50.160]  it's tremendous numbers for years and years and years. And everybody just sort of forgot it.
[1:02:50.160 --> 1:02:54.720]  But yet people still bring it up on Twitter last night. Hey, this is just Diaz even brought up as
[1:02:54.720 --> 1:02:59.440]  like in a, somebody said something like this is the worst part of the tech press. And, and he was
[1:02:59.440 --> 1:03:04.240]  like, the worst part is, you know, people like Gruber who still denied, denied antenna gate.
[1:03:06.240 --> 1:03:11.520]  People are still hung up on that. People still think that there was like in their twisted view
[1:03:11.520 --> 1:03:15.520]  of history, they think Apple had a phone that couldn't make phone calls. And that everybody just
[1:03:15.520 --> 1:03:21.360]  sort of brushed it under the rug. Yeah, no, there's always a lack of context. And what's
[1:03:21.360 --> 1:03:25.840]  interesting is like Apple in some ways has benefited, right? Because they, they weren't criticized
[1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:31.200]  for the sense of the iPhone 4. And this week, you could argue they've gotten less criticism they
[1:03:31.200 --> 1:03:39.840]  deserve for the 8.0.1 update, which that's a terrible, terrible bug. And it, it's very concerning
[1:03:39.840 --> 1:03:45.600]  about how that gets released. And there's, there's a wide, like there's so much potential for
[1:03:45.600 --> 1:03:52.160]  actually real serious investigation and criticism, um, as opposed to, you know, bullshit outing
[1:03:52.160 --> 1:03:57.280]  someone's name crap that, that Bloomberg pulled. But like there, there's, it's a very real issue.
[1:03:57.280 --> 1:04:02.400]  And I think part of the reason it was, it was not really focused on was because everyone was talking
[1:04:02.400 --> 1:04:09.520]  about Bengate. Uh, and it's, yeah, it's, it's frustrating as someone, um, you know, that want,
[1:04:11.040 --> 1:04:16.080]  once, if you want Apple to create good products, you should be way more worried about 8.0.1
[1:04:16.080 --> 1:04:18.240]  in my opinion. They should be worried about the Ben thing.
[1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:23.040]  Yeah, because it's the sort of thing that could happen, you know, feels like it could happen to me.
[1:04:23.040 --> 1:04:26.800]  It could happen to me. I, I happened to not been paying attention at the time that it was
[1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:32.800]  out in a while. And by the time I was, I knew not, you know, to ignore the, the update. Um,
[1:04:32.800 --> 1:04:38.240]  but I could have easily, you know, installed that. Um, and the other thing, I think long term
[1:04:38.880 --> 1:04:44.880]  that, that issue, you know, that the 8.0.1 update does that I think is harmful is it puts the
[1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:50.240]  seat out there that, hey, be careful of, of updating your iPhone, because it could be ruined.
[1:04:50.240 --> 1:04:56.240]  And then it makes some number of people less reluctant to stay up to date, which hurts
[1:04:56.240 --> 1:05:01.120]  Apple and developers in the long run by, you know, increasing fragmentation.
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:06.480]  That, that's a, that's a great point. And, um, no, it's, it's a great point.
[1:05:07.680 --> 1:05:14.160]  But, you know, again, lost, lost in the shuffle of, you know, the great Bengate scandal of 2014.
[1:05:14.160 --> 1:05:19.120]  Yeah, the Ben Gazi name is funny. For some reason though, I just can't quite adopt it. I've,
[1:05:19.120 --> 1:05:24.800]  I've stuck with, I've stuck with Bengate. Yeah. Yeah, it's, yeah. I think that the, the,
[1:05:24.800 --> 1:05:29.520]  the real Ben Gazi, I think it's such an overblown fake scandal. Not that the tragedy of the
[1:05:29.520 --> 1:05:34.400]  people dying is not serious, but the idea that there's anything that was being covered up is just
[1:05:34.400 --> 1:05:38.880]  a bunch of right wing nonsense. But the people who believe it are really, really into it and think
[1:05:38.880 --> 1:05:45.200]  it's, you know, the most important under reported political story of the entire Obama administration.
[1:05:45.200 --> 1:05:49.600]  And I guess it's best to stay away from joking about it. So if you're out there and you're
[1:05:49.600 --> 1:05:54.320]  offended by me, joking about it, I, I, I retract the joke because it's not that funny at joke.
[1:05:55.120 --> 1:06:00.160]  It was just so happens though that it's such, it, it is such, it, it verbally it works so well.
[1:06:01.040 --> 1:06:02.960]  You just put a D in there and it's all of a sudden.
[1:06:02.960 --> 1:06:08.720]  Well, I mean, yeah, I mean, that again, one of those. It only works with a touch with a 10 foot pull,
[1:06:08.720 --> 1:06:14.960]  but right. It only works as a joke though. If everybody sees the real Ben Gazi scandal,
[1:06:14.960 --> 1:06:21.200]  the way I do as a completely overblown hype, whereas if there's, you know, 20% of the people
[1:06:21.200 --> 1:06:26.240]  listening to the show, think it's actually an outrage and a tremendous scandal, then the,
[1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:30.560]  you know, it has the wrong effect because it makes it seem as though, you know,
[1:06:30.560 --> 1:06:36.880]  the Ben Gate is, Ben Gate is a real issue. Right. No, that's exactly it. And I, I'm a,
[1:06:36.880 --> 1:06:39.600]  that's the same reason I've been using Ben Gate as well.
[1:06:40.560 --> 1:06:43.680]  All right. Even though it sounds like Ben Gate, which is my name.
[1:06:44.720 --> 1:06:46.240]  Oh, and it's not Ben Gate, but yeah.
[1:06:46.800 --> 1:06:55.120]  All right. Let's take another break here. Thank our next sponsor. And it's our good friends at
[1:06:55.120 --> 1:07:02.960]  Fracture, F-R-A-C-T-U-R-E. Everything. All of the photos we take, you know, we're talking about
[1:07:02.960 --> 1:07:06.800]  that digital cameras and all the photos we take with our iPhones, you know, how sad is it that
[1:07:06.800 --> 1:07:10.560]  they all, all of them end up trapped somewhere like in our camera roll on the phone,
[1:07:11.840 --> 1:07:16.880]  or an Instagram feed. And we end up looking at them on these tiny little, well, and I guess
[1:07:16.880 --> 1:07:20.800]  now some of the phone screens are not so tiny, but they're still relatively small.
[1:07:20.800 --> 1:07:27.280]  I don't know. We lost something with them when we stopped getting photos printed and having
[1:07:27.280 --> 1:07:32.480]  something we can hang on the wall. Well, Fracture, that's exactly what they do. You send them
[1:07:32.480 --> 1:07:39.040]  your digital photos. They print them directly on pure glass. So it's not like a piece of paper
[1:07:39.040 --> 1:07:43.840]  in a frame with glass in front of it. They actually print on the glass. I've, I've said this
[1:07:43.840 --> 1:07:49.520]  every time I say it's, it's the same sort of effect like with these phones, the way that the iPhone
[1:07:49.520 --> 1:07:55.040]  keeps getting the pixels closer and closer to looking like pixels on glass as opposed to pixels
[1:07:55.040 --> 1:08:00.640]  under glass. That's the effect that Fracture has with photos. It looks like photos on glass,
[1:08:00.640 --> 1:08:06.240]  which is really what it is. And it's a really cool effect. They come with a phone back that's
[1:08:06.240 --> 1:08:11.440]  ready to mount right out of the box. You don't have to take it and then get a frame and put it
[1:08:11.440 --> 1:08:16.320]  in a frame and then hang it. You just buy your Fracture. It shows up. You open the cardboard box
[1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:21.280]  and there it is ready to hang on your wall or ready to put it up on your desk or wherever you
[1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:28.560]  want to put these photos. Such a great service, really, really impressed with the quality of the
[1:08:28.560 --> 1:08:36.880]  output. We have a bunch of them here at home. Also an amazing gift, really great gift for family
[1:08:36.880 --> 1:08:41.520]  members if you want to send grandparents pictures of the kids or stuff like that. And it's also a
[1:08:41.520 --> 1:08:46.400]  real cool talking point where they're like, whoa, and once they see how it's actually this thing
[1:08:46.400 --> 1:08:50.400]  printed on glass, nobody out there in a real world has heard of these guys yet. So it makes you
[1:08:50.400 --> 1:08:57.520]  seem like you're totally in the know of this amazing stuff, really great gift. And they have a cool

[1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:37.840]  So I think we've been a little over the place on the watch, but I've been, I've been very
[1:09:37.840 --> 1:09:42.960]  popular. I personally have been over the place. I've written four pieces now that have,
[1:09:42.960 --> 1:09:48.400]  you know, there's kind of an arc where I'm more opposed all the way to, I think this is really
[1:09:48.400 --> 1:09:54.240]  ambitious and potentially the future. But you've only written, you've written the one, you've
[1:09:54.240 --> 1:10:00.560]  written a couple, you've linked to a few pieces with like a line or two commentary. Like, I think,
[1:10:00.560 --> 1:10:05.520]  I speak for a lot of your readers that is curious on like the Gruber exposition of about the watch.
[1:10:06.720 --> 1:10:10.880]  Yeah, I'm still working my way on that. I thought I'd have something a week ago, a second follow-up,
[1:10:10.880 --> 1:10:17.040]  and I'm still, it's still like in the liquid state, it's not solidified. But, you know, this,
[1:10:17.040 --> 1:10:22.080]  you know, it's why I do the show. I can talk my way through it. Bottom line, here we are, an hour and
[1:10:22.080 --> 1:10:29.760]  10 minutes into the show. Here's thesis statement. Theses statement is, Apple Watch, I believe, is
[1:10:29.760 --> 1:10:36.880]  intended to be a completely standalone platform for computer, personal computing. And it's
[1:10:36.880 --> 1:10:41.520]  relationship to the iPhone. This is not wholly original. I've heard other people say this, you know,
[1:10:41.520 --> 1:10:47.520]  speculate, but I'm going to try to put it very clearly. It's relationship to the iPhone is very much
[1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:53.600]  analogous to the original iPhone's relationship to iTunes running on your PC or Mac, right? And
[1:10:53.600 --> 1:10:57.680]  when you got the first iPhone in 2007, you couldn't even activate it without iTunes. You had to
[1:10:57.680 --> 1:11:04.960]  actually plug it into your computer and run iTunes and activate it on AT&T through your Mac.
[1:11:04.960 --> 1:11:09.600]  It was, you know, that they just didn't have the full stack. They didn't have everything
[1:11:11.120 --> 1:11:16.400]  ready to go for it to be the standalone device that it is today, where you can be a fully functioning
[1:11:18.720 --> 1:11:24.640]  iPhone user with no other computer products. Or, you know, you could just use it with an iPad and
[1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:30.720]  never pair the two and your backups go to the cloud, your software updates come over the cloud
[1:11:32.320 --> 1:11:37.360]  and it you never, never connect it to a Mac or PC. I think that's the relationship the watch
[1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:44.160]  will have with the phone, where eventually it will do full Wi-Fi and eventually it'll have a SIM card
[1:11:44.640 --> 1:11:50.480]  and will do cellular networking. And that doesn't mean, you know, and again, this comes to one of
[1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:55.760]  the topics on ATP, like Marcos thing is never bet against the smartphone. And it's a good point
[1:11:55.760 --> 1:12:02.560]  that the smartphone is sort of an optimal, it's sort of an endpoint, you know, and we're obviously,
[1:12:02.560 --> 1:12:07.040]  you know, the size can fluctuate a little bit. But the basic idea of the thing that you can carry
[1:12:07.040 --> 1:12:10.960]  in your pocket, don't bet against it. You know, there were some of us, myself included, who
[1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:16.320]  thought that the iPad might grow to be bigger than the iPhone, or at least grow to be the same size.
[1:12:16.320 --> 1:12:21.840]  And it's not. It's super successful. Tablets are a huge deal. The iPad is the most successful,
[1:12:21.840 --> 1:12:26.320]  and it is very successful, but it is not as popular and not as successful as the phone.
[1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:34.000]  So I wouldn't say, when I say that the watch will be a standalone platform that won't need a phone.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:37.840]  That doesn't mean that everybody's going to ditch their iPhone and just do everything on a watch.
[1:12:38.560 --> 1:12:43.760]  I just think it means though that some people they could, that they won't have, they don't,
[1:12:43.760 --> 1:12:51.520]  they won't need to carry a phone in their pocket. So I completely agree. I've said,
[1:12:51.520 --> 1:12:57.280]  I actually made the same analogy on, on a previous version of exponent where my co-host
[1:12:57.280 --> 1:13:06.960]  vehemently disagrees. And we definitely got into it. But I think the, the phone for the watch
[1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:13.600]  is an implementation detail. And I think that's, that's critical to understanding the way
[1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:19.920]  Apple, I think, introduced it is because the, the, imagine an Apple had introduced the iPhone.
[1:13:19.920 --> 1:13:25.440]  And they had said, oh, well, you don't need to manage music on your phone because you can do it
[1:13:25.440 --> 1:13:29.600]  on iTunes on the Mac. And it will all sync over, right? Which is what they did, did with the,
[1:13:29.600 --> 1:13:35.840]  with the iPod. The problem is, is that would have, you know, a few years down the line,
[1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:40.880]  it would have been so much more difficult, if not impossible, for Apple to make the iPhone
[1:13:40.880 --> 1:13:48.480]  a truly standalone device. Like from day one, the iPhone, even though it, even though it needed a
[1:13:48.480 --> 1:13:55.440]  Mac, it had to be designed as if it didn't need a Mac, in all the, it's fundamental assumptions.
[1:13:55.440 --> 1:13:59.440]  And I think it's the same thing, it's the same thing with, with the watch, like you can't
[1:13:59.440 --> 1:14:03.360]  build in the assumption the phone is there. If you know it's going to be going away,
[1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:06.960]  else you're limiting, you're lowering the ceiling, you're lowering the, the potential.
[1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:14.160]  And I think the difference from the, from the iPad is this is smaller. And when it comes to,
[1:14:14.160 --> 1:14:19.680]  when it comes to design is all about constraints and what's the controlling constraint,
[1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:26.800]  the controlling constraint, when you're at your desk is not size, it's not weight, it's comfort,
[1:14:26.800 --> 1:14:31.120]  it's productivity, it's why I'm sitting here in front of three monitors and, uh,
[1:14:31.120 --> 1:14:38.240]  or going to have keyboard and, and a mouse. But when you're moving around, the chief constraint
[1:14:38.240 --> 1:14:44.800]  is portability. And the fact of the matter is, is a watch is more portable than a phone.
[1:14:44.800 --> 1:14:48.640]  So not next year, not the year for that, maybe not even five years on the road, but 10 years down
[1:14:48.640 --> 1:14:57.200]  the road, it's, it's very easy, in my opinion, to see me have carrying a much larger smartphone
[1:14:57.200 --> 1:15:03.680]  less frequently because I always have a watch. I think, uh, I'm completely
[1:15:03.680 --> 1:15:07.440]  agreement, except I think 10 years is too long. And I, it goes back to the Bill Gates
[1:15:07.440 --> 1:15:12.800]  adage, which is probably one of the smartest things he's ever said, but that we, as tech people,
[1:15:15.360 --> 1:15:23.840]  perennially vastly overestimate how much we can do in one year. And underestimate how big the
[1:15:23.840 --> 1:15:30.480]  changes will be in 10 years over and over and over every year, every decade. I think 10 years
[1:15:30.480 --> 1:15:34.560]  is too long, because just think about the phone, man, the phone is only set, it was only seven
[1:15:34.560 --> 1:15:40.160]  years ago that we had the original. Uh, I, when did the phone become completely standalone,
[1:15:40.160 --> 1:15:44.160]  when was it that I guess it was probably with iCloud? It was it? So that would have been,
[1:15:44.160 --> 1:15:53.920]  was I was that would were, was it or it would have been, I think, 20, the iCloud was, right?
[1:15:53.920 --> 1:15:58.160]  I thought it was 2011 because it was, all right, it was last keynote. So yeah, Steve Jobs is
[1:15:58.160 --> 1:16:03.520]  last keynote, right. Right. Right. Right. Uh, right. He did the original iPad introduction in 2010,
[1:16:03.520 --> 1:16:08.640]  and then he made a surprise appearance at the second iPad event when he was, uh, technically
[1:16:08.640 --> 1:16:12.400]  on medical leave. And he was like, you know, I didn't want to miss this. And then he was at
[1:16:12.400 --> 1:16:20.080]  WWDC and that was the last time we saw him. Um, so 2011. So that was four years from when the
[1:16:20.080 --> 1:16:26.160]  original iPhone came out. And at that point, you know, it was, you know, four, call it five years,
[1:16:26.160 --> 1:16:31.120]  give, you know, iCloud a year to bake, I guess, but within five years, the iPhone was a wholly
[1:16:31.120 --> 1:16:37.440]  independent platform. Uh, and it, you know, it won't just be like one switch flipping. It's,
[1:16:37.440 --> 1:16:41.680]  you know, do this, then that, then this, then that, you know, I mean, the original iPhone,
[1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:45.520]  it's like, I was thinking about it in the context of the watch. It was crazy how little it did
[1:16:45.520 --> 1:16:50.480]  on its own. You had to sync your calendars and contacts through iTunes, right? Just to get,
[1:16:50.480 --> 1:16:57.360]  so if you wanted to have the same contacts on your phone and, uh, computer, you had to keep
[1:16:57.360 --> 1:17:02.720]  connecting it to iTunes and syncing there. I mean, it was crazy. So if part of that is tech,
[1:17:02.720 --> 1:17:06.560]  I think with the phone and you're right, it's a lot of it comes that the constraints are different.
[1:17:06.560 --> 1:17:13.120]  With the phone, it was more about just that there was just so much software that needed to be
[1:17:13.120 --> 1:17:19.440]  written before they could do it and being able to just depend on iTunes in the meantime,
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:26.400]  just was a very helpful crutch because it was worth launching when they did. It would not have
[1:17:26.400 --> 1:17:32.160]  been worth waiting another two or three years until they had more of that, that whole stack ready to go.
[1:17:32.160 --> 1:17:38.400]  And with the watch, I think it is more engineering, right? Why doesn't it have a SIM card? I think
[1:17:38.400 --> 1:17:44.480]  I simple. I think battery life and size is an issue too, though. Yeah, there is a Samsung one. I
[1:17:44.480 --> 1:17:48.880]  think that has a SIM card, but yeah, it's huge. Yeah, and it's way bigger, right? But the thing is like,
[1:17:48.880 --> 1:17:54.000]  yeah, I would, uh, one thing that you've learned over the years is never bet against, uh,
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:59.200]  miniaturization and never bet against Moore's law. And I think in the antenna, because it's analog,
[1:17:59.200 --> 1:18:04.480]  like there's a lot of real challenges there, but at the same time, like if you've learned anything
[1:18:04.480 --> 1:18:13.360]  in tech, it's don't bet against like don't bet against that kind of stuff. And, uh, this question,
[1:18:13.360 --> 1:18:19.040]  this is the thing that I can't begin with James on my podcast is, you know, where do you draw the line
[1:18:19.040 --> 1:18:24.080]  on what features it's okay to ship with and what features it's okay to ship without. And
[1:18:24.080 --> 1:18:33.360]  the way I draw the line is not by looking at the technical implementation or the, of the feature,
[1:18:33.360 --> 1:18:38.400]  but the impact it has on normal people's lives. And what I mean by that is when the, when the
[1:18:38.400 --> 1:18:45.120]  iPhone came out, uh, people were already plugging in their devices into their computer every night.
[1:18:45.120 --> 1:18:50.720]  Those devices just happen to be iPods. So Apple was just asking you to keep doing the same thing
[1:18:50.720 --> 1:18:55.920]  you were always doing. And, but with a different device, exactly. And so even though it was, if we,
[1:18:55.920 --> 1:19:00.480]  we look back and think, oh my gosh, I had to plug in my phone to sync my calendars. It sounds
[1:19:00.480 --> 1:19:07.120]  ridiculous today. It did not sound ridiculous in 2007. And, and so that's why I think it was okay
[1:19:07.120 --> 1:19:11.520]  to not have that feature because you weren't, you weren't putting a burden on people. You weren't
[1:19:11.520 --> 1:19:16.640]  making people's lives more difficult. Right. And I think the same thing applies to the watch.
[1:19:16.640 --> 1:19:22.160]  I, yes, it would be, there's no, you don't need to wait for the watch to have its own cellular
[1:19:22.160 --> 1:19:27.920]  stack because people already have their phones with them. You're not saying, oh, you have an up
[1:19:27.920 --> 1:19:32.400]  to till today. You have not been carrying a cellular device in your pocket. But now you need to
[1:19:32.400 --> 1:19:37.120]  carry it with you to use the watch. No, people are already doing it. The, the watch is only
[1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:41.360]  making their lives better. And I think I, I agree with you. And I think it will be shorter than
[1:19:41.360 --> 1:19:48.720]  10 years in seven years, say, in 2021, we'll look back and say, man, I can't believe I carried
[1:19:48.720 --> 1:19:54.880]  a phone in my pocket every single hour of every single day. Yeah. Yeah. And so, you know, let's
[1:19:54.880 --> 1:20:02.800]  go back to, let's, you know, like the Newton era, like 1993, 94, most people, very few people
[1:20:02.800 --> 1:20:06.640]  had cell phones and the cell phones that were out. It was, you know, the famous Wall Street,
[1:20:06.640 --> 1:20:10.560]  what, you know, it's more like a brick. So let's say Apple comes out with some kind of digital
[1:20:10.560 --> 1:20:17.040]  watch in 1993 and the watch does something cool. I don't know, do who, you know, forget the details,
[1:20:17.040 --> 1:20:21.680]  but it's, you know, but nobody has a habit of carrying a cell phone at the time. And then they say,
[1:20:21.680 --> 1:20:27.920]  oh, and to make this watch work, you have to carry this four or five inch rectangle in your pocket
[1:20:27.920 --> 1:20:32.640]  with you everywhere. Right. And then everybody be like, well, that, that seems stupid. I don't want
[1:20:32.640 --> 1:20:38.080]  to carry that. You know, here's a five ounce thing that, that is very expensive itself. And you
[1:20:38.080 --> 1:20:41.680]  have to carry it around with you everywhere you go. That's, you're asking people to do something
[1:20:41.680 --> 1:20:47.360]  that is stupid. Right. They're never going to do that. Like you're saying, I completely agree
[1:20:47.360 --> 1:20:54.480]  that they, they can piggyback off the phone now for things like cellular and wifi connectivity
[1:20:54.480 --> 1:20:59.040]  because everybody in, you know, the target audience of people who already carry an iPhone with
[1:20:59.040 --> 1:21:06.080]  them everywhere they go is, is sufficiently large. Right. And I think it's really interesting too,
[1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:12.640]  um, just kind of a slight segue, I guess, is, uh, one thing I haven't done any of my columns,
[1:21:12.640 --> 1:21:19.920]  at least not exist explicitly or in the podcast is like, why, what if we, what if we jump for
[1:21:19.920 --> 1:21:25.760]  like what, what, how do you think, how do you think our tech wise will look like in 2020?
[1:21:27.760 --> 1:21:32.960]  I, I don't know. I'm, you know, but I have, I'm very intrigued that they think this is the way
[1:21:32.960 --> 1:21:38.720]  it's going to go, you know, that it's mostly, you know, that, that, that I think that they're
[1:21:38.720 --> 1:21:44.800]  predicting that a lot of it is going to go to the wrist. Um, I think it's got to be a lot about
[1:21:44.800 --> 1:21:50.240]  voice input, you know, we're going to be talking to our wrist a lot. I mean, I don't see other,
[1:21:50.240 --> 1:21:54.320]  any other way that you're going to, I don't see how they're ever going to invent anything that
[1:21:54.320 --> 1:21:59.280]  would let you type on a, on a piece on something that's small. So, well, I think with interesting
[1:21:59.280 --> 1:22:06.400]  though is, well, first off, if you were to tell someone in 2007, how little we talk on the phone
[1:22:06.400 --> 1:22:11.440]  today, they, they might not believe you. Right. So that's, that's, so I think the voice thing in
[1:22:11.440 --> 1:22:16.000]  general, as far as communication will, will go away. Like what, what do we need Siri for text input
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:22.080]  then? Because we text a lot now. Um, I think what's interesting about the phone is, uh, it's,
[1:22:23.040 --> 1:22:28.000]  I, so actually, if you track like everything you do in a day, how much of it are you actually
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:34.720]  inputting anything? Like how much of it is gathering information or absorbing information as opposed
[1:22:34.720 --> 1:22:40.720]  to actually, you know, putting something in. And I, I suspect at least, I tried to observe myself
[1:22:40.720 --> 1:22:43.760]  for a day. It was really hard. Like it was shocking how many times I pulled my phone on my pocket.
[1:22:45.440 --> 1:22:51.440]  A lot of it is just, just checking, it's just checking stuff all the time. And, uh, and all,
[1:22:51.440 --> 1:22:57.680]  like that's, it's not just that you could do that on a watch. It's that it's better on a watch.
[1:22:57.680 --> 1:23:02.720]  And I think the, for me, the vision is the watch, you have something with you all the time.
[1:23:02.720 --> 1:23:07.520]  And the things that, that's with you all the time is, is where the radio should be. It's where
[1:23:07.520 --> 1:23:13.520]  the connection should be. And it's where kind of the hub should be. And yes, I'm sure we'll still
[1:23:13.520 --> 1:23:17.520]  have smartphones. I don't think they're going away, just like we still have computers. But I think
[1:23:17.520 --> 1:23:23.600]  it's going to be more, it's going to be more about the screen and more about, uh, and that's
[1:23:23.600 --> 1:23:28.560]  what I think the iPhone plus is the future. And it's going to be more dedicated to doing specific
[1:23:28.560 --> 1:23:34.480]  tasks, as opposed to, um, being everything, the, the end, the end all, the end all be all.
[1:23:35.520 --> 1:23:45.120]  Right. Uh, I think that there's a lot of things that you just never going to be done on the watch.
[1:23:45.120 --> 1:23:50.160]  But that's fine, because there's still things that never, there's maybe a stronger word, but
[1:23:50.160 --> 1:23:55.680]  that you're almost never going to do on your phone, right? Like if you have to write, uh, if
[1:23:55.680 --> 1:23:58.880]  you're a graduate student, you have to write a dissertation, you're probably not going to do it on
[1:23:58.880 --> 1:24:03.600]  your iPhone, even on an iPhone plus, although it's a lot more plausible now than it was before.
[1:24:03.600 --> 1:24:07.680]  Well, you're never going to do that on your watch. You're never going to write articles on your watch.
[1:24:08.400 --> 1:24:13.520]  Uh, you're not going to read articles, you know, like somebody like me or you writes a thousand
[1:24:13.520 --> 1:24:18.160]  word essay on the watch or whatever new product comes out in five years, you're not going to read it
[1:24:18.160 --> 1:24:23.920]  on your watch. Although you might have it read to you by Siri, you know, that, that, that, you know,
[1:24:23.920 --> 1:24:30.480]  over Bluetooth, but you're not going to actually read it visually like that. Um, but there's, like you
[1:24:30.480 --> 1:24:35.360]  said, there's an awful lot of things that you do read that are, you know, eminently readable and
[1:24:35.360 --> 1:24:39.040]  fittable on that screen that size. Well, not just that, but this is where continuity, I think, is
[1:24:39.040 --> 1:24:44.880]  particularly interesting, because if, if the watch is always your first window into stuff, your first
[1:24:44.880 --> 1:24:50.880]  encounter with something, if you, if, if it was totally seamless for you to immediately transfer
[1:24:50.880 --> 1:24:56.400]  that to a more suitable device. Um, and not have to muddle around with thinking and all that sort
[1:24:56.400 --> 1:25:00.880]  of stuff, you just, you flick it over or something and now it's on your iPhone plus or you want
[1:25:00.880 --> 1:25:05.840]  to type something. So you put it over on your, on your Mac, like now I think that that's in a
[1:25:05.840 --> 1:25:12.880]  critical component. Like now a watch being the center makes a lot more sense if the, if transitioning
[1:25:12.880 --> 1:25:19.280]  content to more suitable devices is, is totally frictionless and totally easy. I, I'm sure continuity
[1:25:19.280 --> 1:25:25.360]  will not be there this year, but what, what, what state will continuity be in in five, five years?
[1:25:25.360 --> 1:25:33.840]  Yeah. They are, they keep using the word personal. Uh, and they used it on stage. They reiterate
[1:25:33.840 --> 1:25:38.080]  in the website, it says it here. Apple watch, this is from Apple's website, right in the overview.
[1:25:38.080 --> 1:25:44.000]  Apple watch represents a new chapter in a relationship people have with technology. It's the most
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:51.200]  personal product we've ever made because it's the first one designed to be worn. Uh, I do,
[1:25:51.200 --> 1:25:55.200]  I think that, you know, that I don't think they use words like that lightly and I think that
[1:25:55.200 --> 1:26:00.160]  they mean it that we're going to have the way that we have. I think, at least I do personally,
[1:26:00.160 --> 1:26:06.880]  I have more affection, personal affection to my iPhone than any other product. And more than
[1:26:06.880 --> 1:26:12.640]  the iPad, certainly more than the iPad and, and more even than the Mac, even though I, you know,
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  started as, you know, a guy who most, I, you know, 10 years ago, I felt like I wrote more about
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:24.400]  Mac than I did Apple, right? Like I, I never spent a lot of time at during fireball writing about
[1:26:24.400 --> 1:26:31.200]  the iPods. I mean, I did, but it was never as much interest to me as the Mac, even as the iPod grew
[1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:35.760]  to dwarf the Mac in terms of its financial relevance to the company because it just wasn't what
[1:26:35.760 --> 1:26:41.440]  it engaged me. Whereas the phone does right now, I think I write and think more about the phone
[1:26:41.440 --> 1:26:46.400]  than I do the Mac, even though I do all my writing and stuff on the Mac and I still love the Mac.
[1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:51.840]  But it is, there is something about the fact that it's with me all the time. And it's that first,
[1:26:51.840 --> 1:26:56.640]  you know, first responder for my attention. Hey, I'm bored, give me something to do is the first
[1:26:56.640 --> 1:27:02.560]  thing I do that it's, it is, it is more personal. And something on your wrist that you just have
[1:27:02.560 --> 1:27:10.160]  to twist your wrist to look at is another step up in being a personal relationship with technology
[1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:15.760]  from the phone. And I don't, you know, I think that they're, they're not, that's not, those words
[1:27:15.760 --> 1:27:20.320]  aren't empty. I think they really mean it. And I think it's based on their own, you know, usage
[1:27:20.320 --> 1:27:26.320]  internally of the thing. And I think it's, it's a reason to think why this will be a very successful
[1:27:26.320 --> 1:27:34.320]  category for Apple, because, you know, that's every time technology gets more personal,
[1:27:34.320 --> 1:27:40.240]  like laptops are more personal than desktops. And I don't think it's any surprise that Apple's
[1:27:40.240 --> 1:27:45.600]  done better than laptops than they ever did in desktops. Right. Tablets are more personal than,
[1:27:45.600 --> 1:27:49.920]  than Macs. And they've done more than they've done better in tablets than they ever did in PCs.
[1:27:50.880 --> 1:27:54.800]  And phones are more personal yet. And that's their most successful product ever.
[1:27:54.800 --> 1:28:00.800]  I do think it's, it's totally a reason why I get where Mark was coming from. I think as far as like
[1:28:00.800 --> 1:28:07.280]  a worldwide phenomenon, like the device everybody will have, I think that like, they're still
[1:28:07.280 --> 1:28:14.880]  that the delta between a watch and a phone, I'm not sure will ever be great enough to make it
[1:28:14.880 --> 1:28:19.920]  a universal, like universally it will surpass the phone. But I think for a certain type of customer,
[1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:27.200]  again, primarily an Apple customer, you know, as in what I mean is someone who tends to have a
[1:28:27.200 --> 1:28:32.560]  higher income, tends to have a higher willingness to pay, tends to be more focused on the experience
[1:28:32.560 --> 1:28:37.520]  of, of using something. And again, I say that in a gentlest way possible, so no email please.
[1:28:39.760 --> 1:28:45.280]  It's a very compelling market. And one that I think, I think each time you make this stuff
[1:28:45.280 --> 1:28:50.160]  be more personal, Apple's addressable, Apple's percentage of the addressable market increases.
[1:28:51.200 --> 1:28:56.400]  Yeah. No, I totally agree. And that's a very keen observation on the shift, you know, as the
[1:28:56.400 --> 1:29:05.280]  industry shifted from desktop PCs to laptop PCs, it coincides with Apple rising out of the decade
[1:29:05.280 --> 1:29:11.680]  long malaise of PC markets here. Oh, for sure. That's, it's a great point. I actually, I just said
[1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:17.440]  it, but I didn't quite make the connection either. I mean, everyone looks at the iMac, but even
[1:29:17.440 --> 1:29:22.000]  then the iMac was the first computer people willing to put in the living room. But once it came
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:27.520]  to actually carrying something around, no, it made it made a big difference. That's really interesting.
[1:29:28.480 --> 1:29:34.320]  Yeah, iMac was just like a stop the bleeding thing. And it wasn't a get people who'd never
[1:29:34.320 --> 1:29:39.360]  considered a Mac to use a Mac thing, whereas, you know, MacBooks were the thing that really did that.
[1:29:39.360 --> 1:29:45.840]  I keep coming back on the watch. And as my belief that it's a true, it, it, in its own way, and in
[1:29:45.840 --> 1:29:50.400]  ways that we don't fully understand yet, because I think they're being either they're working on it
[1:29:50.400 --> 1:29:55.040]  and they don't, they can't really talk about it. And be, I think that they're very deliberately
[1:29:55.040 --> 1:29:58.960]  being secretive for the next few months, because they don't want to give a competitive leg up
[1:30:00.160 --> 1:30:05.200]  to the companies who they think are going to copy it as best they can as quickly as they can.
[1:30:05.200 --> 1:30:12.320]  So I do think that they are being very cagey about some of the details here. But as one of the
[1:30:12.320 --> 1:30:16.560]  things I'm finding hard to square, I'm convinced I don't know. Nobody at Apple said we're being
[1:30:16.560 --> 1:30:22.240]  pretty, we're being secretive, because we don't want people to copy this. But reading between the
[1:30:22.240 --> 1:30:27.440]  lines, it is sort of what I was told, not in so many words, but it does seem like it, you know,
[1:30:27.440 --> 1:30:34.160]  in terms of why weren't, why wasn't anybody at the event allowed to try a version using the real
[1:30:34.160 --> 1:30:41.760]  software? Part of it was that it wasn't ready, but in 2007, the iPhone wasn't ready when they
[1:30:41.760 --> 1:30:47.360]  announced it. You know, some of the apps were just screenshots, literally, like I forget which ones,
[1:30:47.360 --> 1:30:53.360]  but like the maybe like the stock widget or something, or a calculator. But they let a handful of
[1:30:53.360 --> 1:30:59.600]  people, like David Pogue and, you know, probably Walt Mossberg, I'm sure, but a few of those guys
[1:30:59.600 --> 1:31:05.600]  on, you know, January 2007, six months before it came out, they got to play with, you know, an
[1:31:05.600 --> 1:31:11.280]  iPhone. They didn't hold anything back, you know, and even if some of the apps weren't finished yet,
[1:31:11.280 --> 1:31:15.360]  and you just tap the app and it showed you a screenshot of what it would look like, that was what
[1:31:15.360 --> 1:31:18.720]  it was going to do and what it was going to look like, and the apps they showed on stage where
[1:31:18.720 --> 1:31:23.760]  the apps they shipped with, they didn't do that with the watch, and I think it's a secrecy type thing.
[1:31:24.480 --> 1:31:28.320]  But I don't know how to square that with what I'm about to say, which is I keep coming back,
[1:31:28.320 --> 1:31:35.200]  and I know I told you this offline, I keep going back to the image on Apple's website of the S1.
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:41.440]  It's on, you go to a watch, and I think you go to technology, and you have to scroll down to get to it,
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:45.920]  but you go to the Apple Watch, you go to explore, you hit technology, and you scroll down,
[1:31:47.040 --> 1:31:55.520]  and they show the S1, and they say, here's what they say about, an entire computer architecture
[1:31:55.520 --> 1:32:00.640]  on a single chip. Massive constraints have a way of inspiring, interesting creative solutions,
[1:32:00.640 --> 1:32:06.000]  a prime example is the custom design chip at the heart of Apple Watch. No traditional computer
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:11.600]  architecture could fit within such a confined space, so we found a way to integrate many subsystems
[1:32:11.600 --> 1:32:18.880]  into one remarkably compact module, module, which is then completely encapsulated in resin
[1:32:18.880 --> 1:32:22.400]  to protect the electronics from the element's impact and where.
[1:32:22.400 --> 1:32:28.000]  Configuring an entire computer system on a single chip is an industry first and represents a
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:32.800]  singular feat of engineering and miniaturization. They mentioned it in the event, they're promoting it
[1:32:32.800 --> 1:32:38.560]  here, they're showing it, they're showing a guy, you know, a man's hand holding this tiny little
[1:32:39.200 --> 1:32:44.800]  chip, you know, I would, I know it's an overused frame of reference, but a more or less
[1:32:45.680 --> 1:32:50.560]  posted stamp size chip, but it doesn't look like a chip, there's no exposed electronics
[1:32:50.560 --> 1:32:56.320]  or transistors or anything like that, it is encapsulated. And so even though they're being so
[1:32:56.320 --> 1:33:03.760]  secretive, I feel like that they're bragging about the S1 and and they're showing it and showing
[1:33:03.760 --> 1:33:10.080]  that it's a module suggests so much about how they're going forward. I think it suggests that
[1:33:10.080 --> 1:33:16.960]  the thing is a full computer, it's not meant to be just a peripheral, which I think is what
[1:33:16.960 --> 1:33:23.040]  Android where is and we can come back to that. You know, my understanding of my Android where
[1:33:23.040 --> 1:33:29.120]  is that it's now in no way meant in the long run to be a standalone computing device, it's a
[1:33:29.120 --> 1:33:34.480]  permanent wrist worn notification terminal for your phone for your Android phone.
[1:33:37.520 --> 1:33:45.120]  I think that in the way that in 2007 when they when jobs first showed the iPhone and said and it
[1:33:45.120 --> 1:33:50.960]  runs OS 10, you know, and that there was like a, you know, the decades long, hey, what if Apple made
[1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:55.600]  a minute, you know, stripped down version of Mac OS that could run on a phone, wouldn't that be
[1:33:55.600 --> 1:33:59.440]  great? Well, they did it. And everybody was like blown away that they were able to have a computer
[1:33:59.440 --> 1:34:06.720]  that could run Unix, you know, on a phone. And with, you know, OS 10 style graphics and stuff
[1:34:06.720 --> 1:34:14.640]  like that, fortunately not with Bastion style. Right. I think that they've taken a, it's a similar
[1:34:14.640 --> 1:34:19.280]  jump. Again, in the same, you know, I keep coming back to this that the iPhone is to the watch,
[1:34:19.280 --> 1:34:24.240]  what the Mac was to the iPhone. I think they've made a similar jump in like miniaturization
[1:34:25.520 --> 1:34:31.680]  and encapsulation with this and that it's, you know, roughly, you know, in a way that it can be a
[1:34:31.680 --> 1:34:38.800]  computer, it's going to be a computer. And the modularity of it is what I think. I really do think
[1:34:38.800 --> 1:34:42.160]  that that's the explanation and we can get into this when we talk about pricing. That's the
[1:34:42.160 --> 1:34:47.520]  explanation for why would somebody spend $10,000 on a gold one when two years it's going to be
[1:34:47.520 --> 1:34:52.560]  technically outdated is that I think that you'll be able to take it in for service and have that
[1:34:52.560 --> 1:34:58.080]  S1 popped out and replaced with an S3. Yeah, this is super interesting. Well, it's just one
[1:34:58.080 --> 1:35:03.760]  moment on that. I think the, um, if I can go back to the Android where point for just a second and
[1:35:03.760 --> 1:35:08.720]  then I think the whole retail experience and the, and the potential upgrade ability is super interesting.
[1:35:08.720 --> 1:35:16.640]  Um, but I think it's super significant. You highlighted it. They call the S1 a computer. Like they,
[1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:22.560]  they, like this is the, this is the fundamental point that that has changed where I've changed my
[1:35:22.560 --> 1:35:28.800]  thinking and is key is that Apple makes computers. They don't make accessories. The iPod was the
[1:35:28.800 --> 1:35:33.200]  exception. And this is another computer and it has to be looked at in that in that light.
[1:35:33.200 --> 1:35:37.600]  Yeah, they're not using a different language. You know, when they call the A7 and A8 and all the
[1:35:37.600 --> 1:35:43.520]  A line, they call them SOC systems on a chip. And it's a CPU and RAM and I don't know what else,
[1:35:43.520 --> 1:35:50.080]  you know, on, in one. And it's, it's more on a single chip than in a, the PC world than we ever saw
[1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:56.000]  or have seen. Um, but it's not, you would never call it a full computer on a chip. Like they're
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:00.960]  calling it a full computer on a chip, which to me makes it sound as though if you replaced it
[1:36:00.960 --> 1:36:06.560]  with a different one, you'd still have the same screen. It's almost like turning to watch into like,
[1:36:06.560 --> 1:36:12.480]  like a desktop PC, like where you could replace your PC and keep your monitor. Like you'll
[1:36:12.480 --> 1:36:21.600]  can replace the computer in the watch and keep the gold case and the sapphire display and the crown
[1:36:21.600 --> 1:36:25.280]  and all of your bands that you bought and you just get a new computer inside.
[1:36:26.720 --> 1:36:31.440]  I just want to, I do want to just acknowledge that I think Android Wear under the covers
[1:36:31.440 --> 1:36:37.920]  could be standalone from a technical perspective. Um, I just want, so we don't get bad email because
[1:36:37.920 --> 1:36:43.520]  people have, I've actually been looking into this. Um, but I think the design, the design is always
[1:36:43.520 --> 1:36:48.080]  meant to be with a smartphone. So let's park that because, right, what's the watch? But no,
[1:36:48.080 --> 1:36:52.240]  this is, this is, this is so interesting though, because this is, this is the thing that people
[1:36:52.240 --> 1:36:56.320]  think shouldn't be possible, right? There's always something that shouldn't be possible, right?
[1:36:56.320 --> 1:37:02.400]  And the, everyone thought that modularity was dead, right? With the MacBooks now, you can't
[1:37:02.400 --> 1:37:07.120]  change anything on your own. Uh, the phone for sure, I remember when the phone came out and there
[1:37:07.120 --> 1:37:10.640]  was, there was no external battery and people were going nuts about it. Like, oh my god,
[1:37:10.640 --> 1:37:15.440]  there's no external battery. And the, the thinking then was you can never make something small
[1:37:15.440 --> 1:37:22.240]  enough if you have the constraint of making stuff modular and being able to be easily removed.
[1:37:22.240 --> 1:37:27.760]  But what, what, what it, you know, I thought, I thought about last time we talked, I thought,
[1:37:27.760 --> 1:37:31.600]  oh, want to be interesting if the wearable, if Apple came up, it said, oh, it has no screen,
[1:37:31.600 --> 1:37:36.000]  right? That would be like, oh my god, just like the phone. Oh, it has no keys. Maybe the,
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  oh my god, moment here is, it is modular. It's, it's a computer. It can be changed out. We've
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:49.360]  totally like, we've left so far ahead here that, no, you can't do, I'm sure no individual could do
[1:37:49.360 --> 1:37:55.920]  it. But if you bring it into your Apple Watch shop, uh, they'll be happy to do it for 500 bucks
[1:37:55.920 --> 1:38:02.720]  or whatever. Yeah. And it may be, it won't, even, maybe it won't be offered on the sport edition,
[1:38:02.720 --> 1:38:08.480]  you know, maybe it's only something for the, the stainless steel and gold one, because what,
[1:38:08.480 --> 1:38:14.080]  if it, let's say it costs $500 to upgrade or, well, that's probably too much because if the
[1:38:14.080 --> 1:38:19.840]  starting price of the watch is $349, you know, well, let's, so let's call it $250. Just to pick a
[1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:25.680]  number that's, that's not painless. It's not pocket change, but it's reasonable. If you have a
[1:38:25.680 --> 1:38:35.040]  $350 Apple Watch, you're not going to pay $250 to get the S1 replaced with an S2 or an S3 when
[1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:39.520]  you could just spend $350 again and get a brand new one, which might actually be a little slimmer
[1:38:39.520 --> 1:38:46.160]  and smaller and have it updated industrial design. But if you spent 10 grand on an Apple Watch
[1:38:46.160 --> 1:38:54.160]  edition and it's solid gold, uh, and it still looks great physically on the outside because it's
[1:38:54.160 --> 1:38:58.720]  unscritched because of this display of sapphire and the gold is special, hard and gold.
[1:39:01.360 --> 1:39:05.760]  You've already spent 10 grand on it. Would you spend 250 to get to make it faster and have the
[1:39:05.760 --> 1:39:10.000]  battery last longer and probably, you know, and I'm guessing as part of the service, they'll just
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:16.400]  put a new battery module in, um, you know, because yours has already been through 700, you know,
[1:39:16.400 --> 1:39:23.760]  recharge cycles. Uh, and that's again, in this weird way that they are, even though it's truly a
[1:39:23.760 --> 1:39:29.680]  computer, they're, they're really only comparing it to the existing high-end watch world. There is
[1:39:29.680 --> 1:39:34.880]  no, they never use the word smartwatch, never showed anybody else's. They're just acting as though
[1:39:34.880 --> 1:39:39.760]  Android wear and the stuff Samsung's doing. They're just acting as though that stuff doesn't even
[1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:47.680]  exist. Um, but in the real, you know, high-end luxury watch world, when you buy a $10,000 watch or a
[1:39:47.680 --> 1:39:52.480]  $5,000 watch, you do, you do get it serviced every few years because as a mechanical device,
[1:39:52.480 --> 1:39:57.760]  it needs, you know, expert attention every couple of years just to keep it in perfect working order.
[1:39:58.560 --> 1:40:04.000]  Um, it's expected, you know, and it's not free. You don't, you know, you don't get free service on
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:08.560]  your, your Rolex or Omega or whatever brand watch you have. But, you know, if you've already
[1:40:09.280 --> 1:40:14.400]  bought, bought it for 10 grand and you wanted to last a long time, a $200 service is, you know,
[1:40:14.400 --> 1:40:20.000]  something you don't even bat an eyelash in. What's so, what's so interesting about this idea?
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:24.720]  And so they, they, speaking of accidental, accidental tech podcast, they discussed it at the beginning
[1:40:24.720 --> 1:40:30.240]  of this, of this. And I think, um, all, all of them, whose opinions I respect greatly were, were
[1:40:30.240 --> 1:40:36.480]  dismissive of the idea. I think John Syracuse have put it as being a nerd fantasy, um, which,
[1:40:36.480 --> 1:40:41.360]  which in, in some, it is, he's right. No, it is. And it's like, it's like, it's, you know,
[1:40:41.360 --> 1:40:45.600]  I think the comparison that he would make would be like the X Mac, right? Oh, I can't
[1:40:45.600 --> 1:40:48.720]  Apple make it. That's not computer where I can change the parts and stuff like that.
[1:40:48.720 --> 1:40:57.360]  But I, I think, uh, the reason why I, I, I, I find this so compelling. It'd be very clear,
[1:40:57.360 --> 1:41:03.040]  like, all the available information that we have suggests that this isn't possible, right,
[1:41:03.040 --> 1:41:07.200]  that if you are actually making something so small and you want to maximize battery life,
[1:41:07.200 --> 1:41:12.400]  like the last thing you want to do is, is make any considerations towards, towards modularity.
[1:41:13.120 --> 1:41:22.800]  That said, if you could do this so much about this product comes into queer focus, right?
[1:41:22.800 --> 1:41:28.880]  The, the, the, the gold edition, the idea that they're being like, imagine, imagine, imagine,
[1:41:29.440 --> 1:41:34.480]  let's play with this. Let's assume it's possible. Imagine in 10 years, right? Oh,
[1:41:34.480 --> 1:41:39.600]  you have a first edition, right? And it's, it's not a first edition. Like I have the first iPod
[1:41:39.600 --> 1:41:43.200]  where it's nice that it says to my desk, there's no way in the world to actually use it.
[1:41:43.200 --> 1:41:47.040]  But you have a first edition and you're still wearing it. Like, oh, you got one of those back in
[1:41:47.040 --> 1:41:51.840]  the day. I got, so I have a, my, I have one Swiss watch. It's a, it's a wedding present from my
[1:41:51.840 --> 1:41:57.280]  in-laws. It's like a very traditional sort of wedding present. And, um, it's, it's a, it's a month
[1:41:57.280 --> 1:42:01.840]  bonk. It, so they make pens, right? But they got, they used to make watches like in the 1800s
[1:42:01.840 --> 1:42:04.800]  and then they stopped and they got back into watches. I like the first one they made when they
[1:42:04.800 --> 1:42:10.560]  came back. And like, I feel very proud of that fact that I have like their first one when they
[1:42:10.560 --> 1:42:19.360]  came back on the market. Um, imagine, imagine if, if that was a selling point for, for this watch
[1:42:19.360 --> 1:42:26.640]  or there was different additions and different designers. And the, the value of, of the fashion,
[1:42:26.640 --> 1:42:34.080]  the value of the design, if you know it's timeless, um, used, not making a pun there. But if you
[1:42:34.080 --> 1:42:40.000]  know like it's, it's something that is not a throwaway object, that just completely tilts the
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:44.560]  table when it comes to the importance of fashion, the importance of design, the importance of all this
[1:42:44.560 --> 1:42:51.760]  untangable stuff that Apple specializes in. And it's so, it's like flipping the old PC market on
[1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:56.400]  its head. The way Apple was hurt before is because they couldn't keep up on all the component
[1:42:56.400 --> 1:43:02.000]  parts. But now if they were really so far ahead, it actually accentuates their biggest strengths.
[1:43:03.120 --> 1:43:10.080]  Yeah. I totally agree. Um, and before we move on, I will say, I, I know from corrections from what
[1:43:10.080 --> 1:43:16.400]  I've speculated on Android Wear, that Android Wear devices, they do have gigabytes of local storage.
[1:43:16.400 --> 1:43:21.760]  They do have a full app SDK for running standalone apps, but there aren't many apps yet,
[1:43:21.760 --> 1:43:28.000]  but I guess they're, they're coming soon. Um, and I think it therefore can, can at least,
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:33.200]  if not today is already as planned, you know, without any kind of, oh, now we're going to start
[1:43:33.200 --> 1:43:39.440]  doing more stuff like Apple, like things like playback of podcasts over Bluetooth or something
[1:43:39.440 --> 1:43:43.840]  like that. It seems like it's already planned for that. But it, it, to me though, I, I'm just
[1:43:43.840 --> 1:43:49.120]  guessing though, that if you run any kind of like a benchmark or spec on an Android Wear device
[1:43:49.120 --> 1:43:53.840]  today versus this, the first Apple watch that we see next year, it, I think we're going to be
[1:43:53.840 --> 1:43:57.600]  blown away by the difference in computing performance that they've put into the watch.
[1:43:57.600 --> 1:44:03.040]  No, and this, I think this is really, this is, this is key because like, remember Steve Jobs said
[1:44:03.040 --> 1:44:07.440]  the iPhone is five years ahead of the competition. And it turned out it actually was five years
[1:44:07.440 --> 1:44:14.240]  ahead of the competition. It was around 2012 that, um, that Android, you know, really caught up.
[1:44:14.240 --> 1:44:18.640]  I mean, obviously you and I certainly feel that from an experienced standpoint, the iPhone is
[1:44:18.640 --> 1:44:22.720]  still ahead. Um, from an app standpoint, I would, I would say the artist far as quality of apps,
[1:44:22.720 --> 1:44:29.440]  but from a, you know, are they in the same ball? Right, exactly exactly. And it took about five years.
[1:44:29.440 --> 1:44:34.880]  Yeah. And I think, I think there's, no, I think the, the S one apart, like right now,
[1:44:34.880 --> 1:44:39.040]  it's arguable that Apple's greatest strength right now is, is chip design, which is,
[1:44:39.040 --> 1:44:43.120]  yeah, it's pretty amazing. And, and the S one is, is right in their wheelhouse.
[1:44:43.120 --> 1:44:47.040]  And this is actually, there's one other point that I, well, I, that things really interesting.
[1:44:47.040 --> 1:44:52.560]  It goes back to Bengate, actually. A lot of people are saying about the iPhone. They said it
[1:44:52.560 --> 1:44:55.920]  before, even Bengate happened like, why can't they make it just a little bit thicker and give
[1:44:55.920 --> 1:45:00.800]  us more battery life? And, um, and or back to the IMAX, why are the IMAX, you know, why are they
[1:45:00.800 --> 1:45:07.760]  making them so thin? Like it's sitting on your desk and, uh, John Cirque, who we love,
[1:45:07.760 --> 1:45:12.560]  everywhere our listeners all love, um, but his, maybe his all-time favorite article that he's written,
[1:45:12.560 --> 1:45:16.800]  uh, is something like don't stop thinking about tomorrow or something on those lines.
[1:45:16.800 --> 1:45:22.560]  Basically he says that, uh, when we look, when we look back, it seems like there's these,
[1:45:22.560 --> 1:45:26.480]  these breaks, right, where we, we made these big leaps, like we leapt to the iPhone, all this
[1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:32.320]  sort of stuff. And he's like, but those leaps don't happen by chance, like they happen because
[1:45:32.320 --> 1:45:37.760]  there's just constant, constant, pushing, constant iteration, constantly figuring things out.
[1:45:37.760 --> 1:45:43.680]  And what I think's really compelling about the watch is the reason if Apple has,
[1:45:43.680 --> 1:45:48.160]  well, Apple's clearly done something very impressive and technical perspective. If they've,
[1:45:48.160 --> 1:45:52.160]  even done, done even more than seems possible and done this sort of modularity sort of approach,
[1:45:52.160 --> 1:45:55.920]  like the reason they can pull this off is because they've been making phones so thin.
[1:45:55.920 --> 1:46:00.480]  It's because they've been, in what I mean by that is they've been pushing the envelope on
[1:46:00.480 --> 1:46:06.560]  things like thinness and on things like efficiency and on things like battery life. And, and all
[1:46:06.560 --> 1:46:15.680]  that pays off when they're, they're capable of making something like the watch, uh, that is already
[1:46:15.680 --> 1:46:21.360]  way smaller than anything else on the market. Um, we don't know the battery life, but I, I have to
[1:46:21.360 --> 1:46:27.920]  assume that Apple will, um, you know, they want to make sure it lasts a full day before, before they,
[1:46:27.920 --> 1:46:32.320]  they say anything. Um, but that's, that's the net result of all this stuff that doesn't happen
[1:46:32.320 --> 1:46:41.040]  by accident. Right. And I think that it's, it's tough for, um, a lot of people in the tech world
[1:46:41.040 --> 1:46:44.960]  that that tech focus mentality to wrap their heads around this because they've always thought
[1:46:44.960 --> 1:46:52.000]  that they still think of Apple as a company that doesn't value performance as a top priority. Uh,
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:56.400]  that they, you know, they're a design company and then, you know, Max, you don't get a lot of bang
[1:46:56.400 --> 1:47:03.280]  for your buck performance wise with a Mac, which hasn't really been true for years, but put
[1:47:03.280 --> 1:47:07.360]  that aside though that people just underestimate that. I just don't think that they, they get
[1:47:07.360 --> 1:47:11.760]  their heads around this about, like you said, like just how much Apple as a semiconductor company
[1:47:11.760 --> 1:47:18.240]  is leading the industry in terms of that where they're interested making things smaller and more
[1:47:18.240 --> 1:47:24.320]  efficient. Um, and I thought it was so telling that when a non tech ran their initial benchmarks
[1:47:24.320 --> 1:47:31.120]  of the new iPhones, that in most of the benchmarks, the iPhone 5S is still top five, sometimes
[1:47:31.120 --> 1:47:38.320]  third, just only behind the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus a year later, you know, in a very competitive
[1:47:38.320 --> 1:47:43.760]  industry. I mean, arguably the most competitive industry in all of tech with everybody, you
[1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:51.440]  know, you know, clawing at each other. Uh, and considering that the other guys are the ones who,
[1:47:51.440 --> 1:47:57.280]  who more directly address the spec driven market and that they still don't have phones that
[1:47:57.280 --> 1:48:05.520]  compete with the iPhone 5S or that surpass it at least. Um, I think that's so super telling
[1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:10.880]  about how just how potentially, uh, remarkable the S one could be. And who knows, maybe we're
[1:48:10.880 --> 1:48:15.440]  making fools of ourselves and that the specs of the S of the Apple watch technically aren't
[1:48:15.440 --> 1:48:20.880]  going to be that remarkable compared to Android Wear and other things, you know, who knows, maybe,
[1:48:20.880 --> 1:48:26.240]  you know, we're completely wasting our time and, and fantasizing about this, but I can't help
[1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:30.160]  but think that they would not draw attention to it if it weren't something they were super proud
[1:48:30.160 --> 1:48:35.600]  of, what not in that, not just that, but this is, this is like, this is, this should be the gating
[1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:41.520]  factor and where they should wait or not because to want something that is, that is underpowered,
[1:48:41.520 --> 1:48:48.800]  that does not enable a platform would, would be a mistake because you, you, you, you, once you,
[1:48:48.800 --> 1:48:53.840]  if you start out with, and this is, this is what I've got, this is what I so clearly got wrong and
[1:48:53.840 --> 1:49:01.680]  where I like, I almost felt an urgency to correct myself is if you start out with just the mental
[1:49:01.680 --> 1:49:09.840]  model that this is an accessory, like the iPod was an accessory, you, you're making fundamental,
[1:49:10.480 --> 1:49:16.160]  you're putting fundamental constraints on the product that, that will determine the products
[1:49:16.160 --> 1:49:19.760]  trajectory in the long run, right? It's like Windows eight, right? Windows eight,
[1:49:19.760 --> 1:49:26.560]  uh, couldn't fully break away from being a desktop keyboard mouse and driven sort of thing,
[1:49:26.560 --> 1:49:30.240]  and that's just that, that is handicapped everything else. And it's an extreme example,
[1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:37.200]  but if you, you can't just flip a switch and say, oh, software developer, you designed
[1:49:37.200 --> 1:49:42.160]  an app for the watch, assuming the phone would be there, but now it's not there. Like, there's,
[1:49:43.120 --> 1:49:46.080]  that's very hard to overcome. And that's going to be a challenge for Android Wear,
[1:49:46.080 --> 1:49:52.720]  Android Wear is very explicit right now. You have to have an, an accompanying smartphone app.
[1:49:52.720 --> 1:49:58.080]  Um, and, and, but that's only possible if the S1 is actually a real computer, like that's
[1:49:58.080 --> 1:50:03.840]  only possible. And so I presume it is. I think the modularity, if you can replace it is definitely
[1:50:03.840 --> 1:50:08.640]  an open question, but man, it would be unbelievably compelling, uh, if it was replaced. Yeah,
[1:50:08.640 --> 1:50:12.640]  it's too, I guess it's two different issues. There's the first is just how much is this really,
[1:50:12.640 --> 1:50:18.000]  uh, technically impressive computer. I think that's a sure thing. I, I would, I'm going to eat
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:24.880]  my hat if it's not a blow away technical device at a computer engineering level. Uh, is the,
[1:50:24.880 --> 1:50:29.440]  the, the idea that a year later or two years later, you could take it into the Apple store and
[1:50:29.440 --> 1:50:34.320]  get it replaced with an upgraded version. It, that might be just pure fantasy on my part,
[1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:40.640]  even if the, the gold ones do cost five, six, seven, $10,000, even if they do, it really might be
[1:50:40.640 --> 1:50:46.000]  the case that you, on, you know, you've, okay, thanks for your $5,000, but two years from now,
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:50.240]  you're going to need to spend another $5,000 to get a better one. It might be. I would, you know,
[1:50:50.240 --> 1:50:56.480]  I don't think that's out of hand, but I do think though it's way more compelling if, if it's not.
[1:50:57.680 --> 1:51:01.600]  Uh, let me do the third sponsor, but remind me, I'm going to, here's the, the topic
[1:51:02.240 --> 1:51:07.920]  that I want to come back to after this is if it is modular in terms of being replaceable,
[1:51:07.920 --> 1:51:15.360]  would Apple tell us that in January, or would they wait a year before they say that?
[1:51:16.080 --> 1:51:19.840]  So think about that. Think about that. We'll come back to it. But right now, thank our third
[1:51:19.840 --> 1:51:26.400]  and final sponsor of the show, another new sponsor, really, really happy to have, um, these guys here.
[1:51:27.200 --> 1:51:36.080]  It is, uh, need an EED. Need is a refined retailer and lifestyle magazine from men.
[1:51:36.080 --> 1:51:43.280]  Each month need curates and sells a limited quantity of exclusive products from the world's top
[1:51:43.280 --> 1:51:48.640]  men's brands. These are collections they're presented in the form of like a monthly editorial
[1:51:48.640 --> 1:51:54.720]  built around a certain theme. Uh, and they're shot with beautiful photography by, by local
[1:51:54.720 --> 1:51:59.360]  independent photographers. Um, so stuff like clothing, you want to stay up to date when it looks
[1:51:59.360 --> 1:52:03.360]  stylish. You want to stay up to date on men's fashion. These guys will help you, but it goes
[1:52:03.360 --> 1:52:07.920]  beyond that. It's not just clothing. They also sell coffee. They sell literature, furniture,
[1:52:09.040 --> 1:52:12.880]  and so forth. Just about anything you might be interested in, anything where design matters,
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:17.360]  need has issues, uh, surrounding those things.
[1:52:18.560 --> 1:52:22.080]  Soon they're going to localize to certain cities around the world, the first of which is going
[1:52:22.080 --> 1:52:27.360]  to be London. Uh, so that'll be a keen interest to all of you guys who, who, you know, the listeners
[1:52:27.360 --> 1:52:34.640]  over in the UK. Um, they just launch need volume eight assembly. That's the theme. And it features
[1:52:34.640 --> 1:52:41.920]  some of the best products, um, for evenings with friends, hosting parties, that sort of thing,
[1:52:41.920 --> 1:52:46.880]  assembly in terms of, you know, assembling you and your friends and family together. Um,
[1:52:48.400 --> 1:52:55.840]  they've got favorites like the Stewart Throw, Shwood sunglasses, uh, and the classic Oxford watch,
[1:52:55.840 --> 1:53:01.360]  which is a really cool classic watch. Um, here's where you go to find out more. Their website is
[1:53:01.360 --> 1:53:10.720]  need addition.com. That's addition like the addition, addition of a magazine. Need addition.com.
[1:53:11.520 --> 1:53:16.800]  And they have a special offer for talk show listeners. Anyone who places an order with need,
[1:53:17.440 --> 1:53:24.240]  and we were sent from the show, go there order and then send an email to hello at need addition.com.
[1:53:24.240 --> 1:53:32.640]  Hello at need addition.com with the subject line. This is the code. No spoilers. And then after you,
[1:53:32.640 --> 1:53:37.200]  you place the order, then you just shoot them an email and send them that code word in the subject.
[1:53:37.200 --> 1:53:43.200]  No spoilers. Write it down. Put it in your best word. Uh, they'll throw in a bunch of extras with
[1:53:43.200 --> 1:53:49.680]  your order. Uh, extra magazines, custom field notes, socks, scarves, all sorts of stuff. Uh,
[1:53:49.680 --> 1:53:57.360]  uh, and you'll be put on a list to get 25% off your next order. Maybe the next month when the next
[1:53:57.360 --> 1:54:02.080]  issue comes out. So just remember that hello at need addition.com after you place an order with
[1:54:02.080 --> 1:54:10.400]  no spoilers as the subject, sort of a low low tech, uh, hand delivered, uh, product code just for
[1:54:10.400 --> 1:54:16.480]  listeners of the show. So my thanks to them. Really great stuff. Really impressive, uh, design and
[1:54:16.480 --> 1:54:20.640]  curation. Really these guys find stuff that I've never heard of and it's, it's really, really cool
[1:54:20.640 --> 1:54:26.160]  stuff. Uh, absolutely positively worth your attention and, and trying this out. So my thanks to need.
[1:54:27.760 --> 1:54:32.800]  All right. I told you to remember what I, what did I want to ask you? If, if when they introduce,
[1:54:33.520 --> 1:54:39.280]  if it is module, will they say so right? Will they tell us? Absolutely. I mean,
[1:54:39.280 --> 1:54:47.200]  like I said, if it's modular, it changes the entire perception and conceptualization of what this,
[1:54:47.200 --> 1:54:55.360]  of what this is, right? It goes, it changes from being another, a very pretty and, and cool, yet
[1:54:55.360 --> 1:55:03.280]  disposable item to being like something meaningful, right? The way the way a watch is meaningful,
[1:55:03.280 --> 1:55:10.880]  like a high, a high on watches meaningful. And, uh, no, I, I think it would be, I think it's
[1:55:10.880 --> 1:55:17.680]  difficult to overstate, uh, what a difference that would make, um, in the way people think about
[1:55:17.680 --> 1:55:22.960]  the entire, the entire category in the, in the entire watch. And that, by the way, that would,
[1:55:24.480 --> 1:55:28.800]  I mean, that would just pull the rug out from all the Android devices and just, uh, you know,
[1:55:28.800 --> 1:55:34.560]  pretty unbelievable way. I mean, the, it would very clearly Apple would be setting themselves up
[1:55:34.560 --> 1:55:43.040]  as, uh, we are the Swiss, but with a relatively, you know, we're swatch all the way up to Cartier.
[1:55:43.040 --> 1:55:49.120]  Yeah. Um, right. And you guys, uh, you can have, you know, you're the Casios of the market or
[1:55:49.120 --> 1:55:56.080]  stuff like that. Um, and no, I, I, of course, that, that would be a central key point in my opinion.
[1:55:56.080 --> 1:56:01.840]  Yeah. I, I think so too. The only reason I could think that they wouldn't is if they're unsure,
[1:56:01.840 --> 1:56:06.560]  if it's like that's their hope and that's their plan, but they don't want to promise it in advance
[1:56:06.560 --> 1:56:11.280]  because what if something comes up and went the, the way that they want to make the S2, it's not
[1:56:12.240 --> 1:56:21.760]  socket compatible with, you know, with the S. Yeah. Well, I think of the S2 is already on the drawing
[1:56:21.760 --> 1:56:27.920]  board at, at least. Um, and not just that, but the, the, it's the first edition that's going to
[1:56:27.920 --> 1:56:32.720]  have the biggest battery life challenges that's going to have all these sort of things. And it,
[1:56:32.720 --> 1:56:38.080]  like, for example, if to, to make something modular, even if it has to be done by technician,
[1:56:38.080 --> 1:56:43.360]  right, to make anything modular, you're, you're making some sort of trade off in space in particular.
[1:56:44.080 --> 1:56:49.920]  Spaces is the biggest one by far. And that is such a massive constraint right now that if they're
[1:56:49.920 --> 1:56:54.240]  willing to make that trade off in version one, they're, they're only going to make that trade off
[1:56:54.240 --> 1:56:57.440]  if, if they're, if they're, they're not going to do that for optionality. They're going to do
[1:56:57.440 --> 1:57:03.120]  it because they think they'll pay off there. And ways that it would work, if you just think, wow,
[1:57:03.120 --> 1:57:06.720]  yeah, it's just sounds so crazy. It sounds so crazy because Apple's the company that famously
[1:57:06.720 --> 1:57:11.200]  got scorched, like you said, for not having a replaceable battery user replaceable battery,
[1:57:11.200 --> 1:57:15.280]  but you can replace your battery. I'll just point out, you've always been able to replace your
[1:57:15.280 --> 1:57:19.120]  battery and your phone by taking it into Apple and having an, you know, it's just that you can't
[1:57:19.120 --> 1:57:24.000]  pop off the back yourself and put a replacement in. It's not user swappable throughout the day.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:29.360]  Yeah. But it is, you know, certainly modular in terms of if your battery is, if you got a bad battery
[1:57:29.360 --> 1:57:34.400]  or an old battery, you can go in and get a new one. But the way that things evolve, the way
[1:57:34.400 --> 1:57:39.120]  computers dissolve, evolve, certainly personal computers is they get smaller and more efficient.
[1:57:40.160 --> 1:57:45.840]  So as the S one gets smaller and more, or, you know, the S series gets smaller and more
[1:57:45.840 --> 1:57:52.160]  efficient over the years, there's always going to be room in your original 2015 Apple watch for
[1:57:52.160 --> 1:57:57.440]  the new smaller S. Right. Exactly. Exactly. Because like the nature, like the next version of the
[1:57:57.440 --> 1:58:02.160]  physical hardware could be smaller. And that's not a problem for the original because if you
[1:58:02.160 --> 1:58:09.040]  presume that this will be the biggest, the it ever is, um, which is an exceptionally reasonable
[1:58:09.040 --> 1:58:14.560]  position to take, certainly the thickest it's ever going right. I mean, because like, like, you know,
[1:58:14.560 --> 1:58:18.720]  it's certainly one of the knocks against it from a watch person's perspective, specifically
[1:58:18.720 --> 1:58:23.280]  called out by, by Ben Kleimer of Houdinke that it does sit a little higher in your wrist. And
[1:58:23.280 --> 1:58:27.280]  therefore, you know, the issue with a watch that's physically thick is it's, you know, your,
[1:58:27.280 --> 1:58:34.080]  your shirt sleeves might get caught on it. Um, and it would leave room if, if I'm correct too,
[1:58:34.080 --> 1:58:38.720]  that if there is a swappable strategy, you know, an upgradeable strategy that they're going to do
[1:58:38.720 --> 1:58:44.800]  the battery along with this one, because batteries, you know, deteriorate over time and they're
[1:58:44.800 --> 1:58:49.360]  expressly one of the few things they're telling us already is that you will need to charge it
[1:58:49.360 --> 1:58:55.440]  every day. So it's going to go through a lot of, uh, you know, if you use and light your Apple watch
[1:58:55.440 --> 1:59:01.120]  you're going to go through close to 365 upgrade, you know, battery cycles a year that they'll do
[1:59:01.120 --> 1:59:06.320]  that too. But then if the S1 shrinks a little every year, then they're, they can make the battery
[1:59:06.320 --> 1:59:10.960]  a little bigger. Not just that, but battery technology, unfortunately not fast enough, but it does
[1:59:10.960 --> 1:59:18.400]  improve, you know, regularly. Um, right. The other thing, just a side note, I think one of the other
[1:59:18.400 --> 1:59:25.360]  things that changed my mind about the eye watch that needs to be more or not less is, uh, the reason
[1:59:25.360 --> 1:59:29.920]  we, like, an iPhone was, was terrible at battery life compared to what was on the market.
[1:59:29.920 --> 1:59:36.480]  Uh, in it, but we put up with, like it was, people couldn't believe, are you going to really charge
[1:59:36.480 --> 1:59:43.440]  your phone every night? But people did it because it was so much better. And I think that's another
[1:59:43.440 --> 1:59:52.080]  reason to presume that Apple is wants the watch to do so much more, that it's so compelling that
[1:59:52.080 --> 1:59:56.720]  you will put up with charging the way to overcome charging every night is to not to make a watch
[1:59:56.720 --> 2:00:01.840]  that last for two weeks, because that's impossible. The way to overcome it is to make it worth the
[2:00:01.840 --> 2:00:09.200]  trouble. Right. A bringing an extra adapter. Right. Yeah. So what do you think the retail experience,
[2:00:09.200 --> 2:00:15.280]  I mean, especially if there's changing batteries and or changing processors? Well, I think it starts,
[2:00:15.280 --> 2:00:21.440]  uh, take another step back and hit on another topic from ATP recently, which was wait a minute, isn't this
[2:00:21.440 --> 2:00:27.680]  uh, on Apple like like the app and end, you know, I think it was one of Marco's lines. And
[2:00:27.680 --> 2:00:34.800]  but I've seen this all across the web that the, the, the, what we think of is the Apple way to do
[2:00:34.800 --> 2:00:42.160]  it is to make one Apple watch the first year. And it would be compelling to everybody. Men and
[2:00:42.160 --> 2:00:47.600]  women, it would be, let's, you know, let's just split the middle instead of 42 and 38 millimeter,
[2:00:47.600 --> 2:00:55.440]  let's call it 40 millimeter, uh, appealing to men and women, possibly even one color and one type of
[2:00:55.440 --> 2:01:01.760]  band. And that's it. And then maybe over years, it would, it may be the product line would grow.
[2:01:01.760 --> 2:01:06.000]  And that is, you know, and it would be, you know, an aluminum and glass type thing that sells
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:14.480]  for 350 bucks price that all existing Apple customers can afford. Uh, that this idea of selling
[2:01:14.480 --> 2:01:21.680]  what I think are going to be $1,500, $2,000 stainless steel ones and $5,000, $10,000 gold ones,
[2:01:23.120 --> 2:01:26.880]  all of it coming out once. Doesn't that mean that Apple, as we know, it is over and it's,
[2:01:26.880 --> 2:01:32.800]  it's, you know, whether it's for better or for worse, it's different. Or it doesn't even make sense.
[2:01:32.800 --> 2:01:36.480]  And because you know what, it's funny thing too is I don't know how many people who listen to
[2:01:36.480 --> 2:01:41.280]  the show are going to disagree with us. But at least on Twitter, when I wrote my piece,
[2:01:41.280 --> 2:01:44.960]  you know, we can have to go two weeks ago, man, I mean, a lot of people are like, wow, that was
[2:01:44.960 --> 2:01:47.840]  really insightful. You really opened my eyes. I think you're onto something here. And then there
[2:01:47.840 --> 2:01:54.640]  was an awful lot of vitriol. I got more negative feedback on that piece than anything that I've
[2:01:54.640 --> 2:01:59.840]  written in a long time. And these are, this is from people who I think usually agree with or
[2:01:59.840 --> 2:02:03.920]  like what I have to say about Apple. But there, I mean, there were people who are saying things
[2:02:03.920 --> 2:02:12.480]  like if the gold one even costs twice the, the, the, you know, $350 that, that, that, you know,
[2:02:12.480 --> 2:02:17.520]  they're going to lose their shit. It's, it's, I don't think people get, I don't think what I
[2:02:17.520 --> 2:02:24.240]  don't think people get is just how different this is from anything Apple's done before. It's not
[2:02:24.240 --> 2:02:28.400]  right. You're, you're doing yourself a disservice if you're thinking about it in the context of how
[2:02:28.400 --> 2:02:34.160]  Apple has done things in the past. I completely agree. Like what's interesting about, um, it's
[2:02:34.160 --> 2:02:39.680]  funny. I mentioned that my criticism critical of the watch piece was both very popular as widely
[2:02:39.680 --> 2:02:45.760]  shared, like hundreds and hundreds of tweets. Um, my, uh, my recent piece, the one that you
[2:02:45.760 --> 2:02:49.840]  winked. Well, let's use that one as an example. Like you've winked to several of my pieces in the past.
[2:02:49.840 --> 2:02:55.280]  Usually they're both, you know, they get a lot of views and they're also shared a lot on Twitter.
[2:02:55.280 --> 2:02:59.120]  My one this week has gotten a lot of views, but it's, it's hardly gotten shared on Twitter at
[2:02:59.120 --> 2:03:03.920]  all. And what's interesting is I think it's, it's, it's actually of a piece with the pricing
[2:03:03.920 --> 2:03:08.720]  thing. And what I mean by that is I, I think, and I'm, I think this why it's been so hard to
[2:03:08.720 --> 2:03:13.520]  articulate. I think what Apple's had a hard time articulating is that if, if we are right,
[2:03:14.080 --> 2:03:23.360]  that Apple is, like Apple is going for this future that is just wildly more ambitious than
[2:03:23.360 --> 2:03:27.200]  anyone I think was originally thinking about. And that might be from a price perspective. It might
[2:03:27.200 --> 2:03:31.280]  be from a style perspective. It might be from a performance perspective. It might be from an
[2:03:31.280 --> 2:03:38.160]  a West perspective. Uh, it's, it's almost like people like, yeah, it just doesn't fit with
[2:03:38.160 --> 2:03:45.440]  anyone's model of the way things ought to be. And I think a lot of people, uh, just, I'm, some
[2:03:45.440 --> 2:03:49.200]  people is very strongly disagree. I've definitely heard from them, but a lot of people just,
[2:03:49.200 --> 2:03:55.280]  they're not, they don't know what to think. It's just like what, it's just a, I don't know what
[2:03:55.280 --> 2:04:00.000]  to think. Like what's, what's going on here? I think the price thing is, is very much of a piece
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:07.600]  with that. I mean, the idea that Apple would sell a, from a tech person perspective, an
[2:04:07.600 --> 2:04:14.480]  identical device for 10 times or more the price of another identical device just does not compute.
[2:04:14.480 --> 2:04:20.960]  Right. In a way that like, and I go back to the car analogy that, you know, like the case he made
[2:04:20.960 --> 2:04:30.480]  the point of Marco that, hey, you've got a BMW M5, uh, you know, that costs triple what even a regular,
[2:04:30.480 --> 2:04:36.400]  you know, nice car costs. And you're still bound by the same speed limits. And even if you want
[2:04:36.400 --> 2:04:41.520]  to disobey the speed limits, you can't go that much faster, you know, than, than the speed limit.
[2:04:41.520 --> 2:04:47.680]  And, you know, maintain any kind of, you know, reasonable safety. Marco, I believe does not do
[2:04:47.680 --> 2:04:52.560]  any kind of recreational auto racing, you know, which some people do, some people do, you know,
[2:04:52.560 --> 2:04:59.680]  just go on test tracks and stuff like that. Um, you know, it's, but it still is a better car,
[2:04:59.680 --> 2:05:06.080]  technically than, uh, you know, $30,000 accurate or something. Right. It's, you know, technically
[2:05:06.080 --> 2:05:12.720]  engineering lives, it's a better car. Whereas the computer inside the Apple watch edition is,
[2:05:12.720 --> 2:05:19.040]  I believe, going to be the exact same computer in the Apple watch sport. Yep. No, no, and, and it,
[2:05:19.680 --> 2:05:24.960]  it goes back full circle because what Apple is selling now? And they've always sold this,
[2:05:24.960 --> 2:05:30.080]  but it's always been, it's always been the frosting on the cake. Right. But now, like, it is the
[2:05:30.080 --> 2:05:36.640]  cake. What they're selling is they're selling the intangibles. They're selling their, like gold,
[2:05:36.640 --> 2:05:43.600]  the idea of gold being more valuable is, is a peer human construct. Right. There's nothing,
[2:05:43.600 --> 2:05:50.240]  like, right. Gold doesn't really have any innate applications that meet that the reason
[2:05:50.240 --> 2:05:54.160]  gold is more valuable is because we as a human race have decided that gold is more valuable.
[2:05:54.880 --> 2:05:57.920]  Like, it's completely, it's value is almost completely intangible.
[2:05:57.920 --> 2:06:03.920]  Right. When you're in a museum and you see like an old, very old, like a sword or a weapon
[2:06:03.920 --> 2:06:08.640]  that's made or crafted partly out of gold, that's, it's certainly not because gold made for a
[2:06:08.640 --> 2:06:14.000]  stronger sword and weaker sword. Yeah. Right. It's, you know, almost if, you know, it's a showpiece.
[2:06:14.000 --> 2:06:19.840]  It's effectively useless in a real combat. But it's, you know, it signifies something
[2:06:19.840 --> 2:06:24.880]  else entirely. This is, I feel like this, this in particular, and you nailed it by saying it's,
[2:06:24.880 --> 2:06:32.000]  it's going to be culture shock. This is just completely anathema to the traditional tech
[2:06:32.720 --> 2:06:39.760]  mindset and the geek mindset that I think is very, you know, is very focused on
[2:06:40.640 --> 2:06:45.440]  efficiency. That's very folk in efficiency in all means, not just efficiency in computing,
[2:06:45.440 --> 2:06:50.800]  but efficiency in using money, efficiency in how you live your life. Like, I want to have a hack
[2:06:50.800 --> 2:06:55.680]  where I can, I can get this experience for a tenth of the price that I should otherwise or
[2:06:55.680 --> 2:07:01.920]  something on those lines. Like Apple, like a gold edition watches the exact opposite direction.
[2:07:01.920 --> 2:07:06.160]  It's more expensive for the sake of being expensive. And I don't mean that in a,
[2:07:06.160 --> 2:07:13.520]  people have made the analogy that I am rich app. No, it's not, it's not that because the, the benefit
[2:07:13.520 --> 2:07:19.840]  accruing to the person using that is at a very superficial level, I suppose, I can see the analogy,
[2:07:19.840 --> 2:07:26.640]  but it's, again, I think the, the, the, the class here has to be the luxury, the luxury goods
[2:07:26.640 --> 2:07:34.560]  market where, um, the reality is, the rally is, uh, most luxury items are less functional than,
[2:07:35.600 --> 2:07:41.600]  than the cheaper alternative is, um, but, and famously in the watch world, the famously that,
[2:07:41.600 --> 2:07:48.320]  the, the, a quartz watch, a, a $20 quartz time X keeps better time than a $20,000.
[2:07:48.320 --> 2:07:55.120]  Oh, yeah. I mean, my, my watch is, is, is terrible. Like it's always off. Um, and, but,
[2:07:55.760 --> 2:08:02.000]  just because, just because it's not tangible doesn't mean it's not real. And, and what I mean,
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:07.680]  and it's not real, and it's not real in a, like marketing artificial sense, like it's,
[2:08:07.680 --> 2:08:14.640]  people actually care about this, and they've cared about it for, for thousands, millions of years.
[2:08:14.640 --> 2:08:18.960]  Like, there's, isn't a fluke that people value, that people value by,
[2:08:18.960 --> 2:08:23.360]  I, I, I'm being very expressive right now. My wife just looked in the window,
[2:08:23.360 --> 2:08:29.360]  because I look out on the porch and I just toy lost my train of thought. Um, but, uh, uh, it's
[2:08:29.360 --> 2:08:33.920]  very, people care about this stuff in a very real way. They've cared about for millions of years.
[2:08:33.920 --> 2:08:38.560]  It's not a fluke. And what Apple's tapping into is, is a real thing.
[2:08:39.120 --> 2:08:43.920]  I think, and I'm trying to think about the other eyes and teas I want to cross here.
[2:08:43.920 --> 2:08:48.800]  One of the things I want to talk about is just sort of pure tangent, but Wi-Fi. They, they,
[2:08:48.800 --> 2:08:54.080]  though, the Apple watch does have some sort of Wi-Fi, but they call it Apple calls it that it
[2:08:54.080 --> 2:08:59.920]  has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. I'm not quoting here, but it's to stay in touch with your iPhone.
[2:08:59.920 --> 2:09:05.200]  So I think what they're saying, and I asked, and could not get a, an actual straight answer,
[2:09:05.200 --> 2:09:09.600]  but the insinuation was that it's like the back channel Wi-Fi, or whatever you want to call it,
[2:09:09.600 --> 2:09:18.080]  ad hoc Wi-Fi, where it uses Wi-Fi, like the way that you can do things now, like pairing a keyboard
[2:09:18.080 --> 2:09:22.000]  with, you know, your Apple TV and stuff that you can do these things without getting it on the
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:27.440]  network first, or, or the way, uh, air drop works, right, that you can air drop things to people
[2:09:27.440 --> 2:09:32.240]  over Wi-Fi without being on the same Wi-Fi network. Right. Then go to the negotiation happens over
[2:09:32.240 --> 2:09:38.000]  Bluetooth, but then it uses Wi-Fi. Yeah. I think that's the Wi-Fi that it has. Like, it's not
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:45.680]  that you could go out without your phone, go to Starbucks and get on Wi-Fi and have iMessage's show up
[2:09:45.680 --> 2:09:51.120]  and get your email to show up. I don't think, but they didn't, they, they haven't expressly ruled
[2:09:51.120 --> 2:09:56.880]  that out. So I have to, we have to file it in the big pile of I don't know's, but the strong hint
[2:09:56.880 --> 2:10:02.560]  that I got was that it doesn't have like true independent Wi-Fi, like go get on a Wi-Fi network
[2:10:02.560 --> 2:10:07.920]  without outside tethering range to your iPhone. It's a way to use Wi-Fi to extend the tether
[2:10:07.920 --> 2:10:14.800] ing range to your iPhone. Yeah. I believe, which, which makes sense. I mean, if that, that sounds
[2:10:14.800 --> 2:10:21.520]  really like a user interface disaster to have to like join random Wi-Fi networks. Um, and if
[2:10:22.160 --> 2:10:28.800]  like it's almost like simpler to just say it works with your iPhone. Um, and then once, once you
[2:10:28.800 --> 2:10:34.560]  can do it all, do it all, right? It's like resolution independence, right? I do think, though, that
[2:10:34.560 --> 2:10:39.200]  that's how the product will evolve, though, is that before it gets cellular, it would, I mean,
[2:10:39.200 --> 2:10:43.840]  absolutely makes sense to have Wi-Fi first. It's consumes, you know, less battery, just like the way the
[2:10:43.840 --> 2:10:50.560]  iPod touch as a Wi-Fi only device has always been thinner than the iPhone. It still is, even today,
[2:10:50.560 --> 2:10:56.800]  the two year old iPod touch design is thinner than even the iPhone 6. Um, because it's, you know,
[2:10:56.800 --> 2:11:01.840]  there's less stuff you have to put in there to just do Wi-Fi. Um, so I think it would make sense
[2:11:01.840 --> 2:11:07.280]  for a future version of Apple watch to have, I don't know what to call it, real Wi-Fi support
[2:11:07.280 --> 2:11:11.760]  where you can use it as an independent device anywhere you have Wi-Fi before it even gets
[2:11:11.760 --> 2:11:15.280]  cellular networking. But I don't think it's going to be there this year. That's interesting,
[2:11:15.280 --> 2:11:18.400]  but it would be a nice surprise. It would be a nice surprise if it were. Maybe, maybe they're
[2:11:18.400 --> 2:11:23.280]  waiting to see what, where they can get battery life too. Like if, if the battery life ends up being
[2:11:23.280 --> 2:11:28.720]  sufficient to enable it, they will. And if it, if like that's a, that's a big potential area of
[2:11:28.720 --> 2:11:32.560]  the like, would they just can't get the battery to be good enough? Well, we'll cut this. And then
[2:11:32.560 --> 2:11:39.760]  that gives us an extra hour or two hours. Yeah. A repeated strain of criticism of my assumption,
[2:11:39.760 --> 2:11:46.160]  I bank on it that 349 means Apple sport. And it's aluminum and what they call it, what they
[2:11:46.160 --> 2:11:53.040]  call it, I on X class. Uh, it's a glass display and an aluminum case. So in other words, it's like
[2:11:53.040 --> 2:11:59.920]  iPod, iPhone, build quality and materials. That's 349 stainless steel is going to be more expensive
[2:11:59.920 --> 2:12:05.120]  because the stainless steel, just plain Apple watch is, in addition to being stainless steel,
[2:12:05.120 --> 2:12:12.560]  it's a sapphire display. Um, and stainless steel is not that expensive of a material, but it's,
[2:12:12.560 --> 2:12:16.880]  you know, if you look at what stainless steel high and watches cost, they cost, you know, four digits,
[2:12:16.880 --> 2:12:21.760]  not three digits usually. Or, or, and if they do cost three digits, they're lesser brands and they're
[2:12:21.760 --> 2:12:27.040]  close to a thousand dollars. Uh, and the gold one I'm telling is going to be a lot of money.
[2:12:27.040 --> 2:12:32.400]  But a lot of people said, well, no, no, no, I, you know, Apple watch is the one that just
[2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:37.760]  is called Apple watch. That's the one that's got to be 349 because it's just called Apple watch.
[2:12:37.760 --> 2:12:42.240]  Apple sport must be a little bit more expensive or something like it's optimized for working
[2:12:42.240 --> 2:12:48.320]  out or something like that. And it's made of aluminum to be lighter weight. Uh, and that only the
[2:12:48.320 --> 2:12:51.920]  gold one's going to be more expensive. And then if you look at the way they put them on the page,
[2:12:51.920 --> 2:12:58.080]  they put Apple watch first, then Apple sport or Apple watch sport, and then Apple watch edition.
[2:12:58.720 --> 2:13:03.520]  What sense would it make to arrange them like that? Um, I, I think these people are just,
[2:13:03.520 --> 2:13:08.000]  the people who think that are just, you're, you're just looking at this all wrong. I don't think
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:12.320]  it's a coincidence that Apple watched the stainless steel one, which I think is probably going to
[2:13:12.320 --> 2:13:19.200]  cost like maybe like 999. Uh, I don't think it's a coincidence at it first. I think Apple might
[2:13:19.200 --> 2:13:25.600]  honestly think it might be the best selling one that the low end one may not be the best selling.
[2:13:25.600 --> 2:13:30.640]  In the same way that the iPhone 5C did not outsell the five S last year.
[2:13:31.440 --> 2:13:36.400]  Yeah, it's, that's, that's a, that's a great analogy to the, to the S and C. And I, I think
[2:13:36.400 --> 2:13:43.520]  the which one sells more will come back to the modularity question. I know that would certainly
[2:13:43.520 --> 2:13:51.360]  change the product that I would buy. Um, you know, just because I, as much as I like to talk about
[2:13:51.360 --> 2:13:57.360]  the, these intangible aspects and things about about Apple, um, I'm enough of a geek that I'm
[2:13:57.360 --> 2:14:01.200]  not going to, I'm not going to spend a few thousand dollars on a device that's going to be
[2:14:01.200 --> 2:14:06.720]  obsolete in two years. Yeah, I'd, you know, but I definitely think though that people are just,
[2:14:06.720 --> 2:14:11.360]  they just cannot wrap their heads around the fact that the default model is not going to be the
[2:14:11.360 --> 2:14:15.840]  low end. Not. And that again, I think the phone is the way to look at that. The default iPhone,
[2:14:15.840 --> 2:14:20.400]  the one that they expect most people to buy is the iPhone 6. No, for sure. And this, and this gets
[2:14:20.400 --> 2:14:27.920]  back to why even, um, I mean, obviously I, I, I'm, I harping this a lot, but the, the, you can't
[2:14:27.920 --> 2:14:33.120]  understand, in my opinion, like you cannot understand product development at Apple without
[2:14:33.760 --> 2:14:38.400]  thinking very strongly about the Asian market in general in the Chinese market in particular.
[2:14:38.400 --> 2:14:42.320]  Yeah. Um, yeah. So there's that term. That's, that's throw it out there.
[2:14:42.320 --> 2:14:46.160]  Veblim, Veblim good. Yeah. Some people just rise in with the wall because they're like, it's not
[2:14:46.160 --> 2:14:50.960]  really a real contract guy. And I get what they're saying. Basically the idea is, uh, when you,
[2:14:51.920 --> 2:14:57.200]  in general, uh, the demand curve works that the cheaper something is the more it sells.
[2:14:57.200 --> 2:15:02.480]  And I think in general, that, that's true for everything, right? If, if an iPhone were cheaper,
[2:15:02.480 --> 2:15:09.200]  it would sell more. Um, but the, the idea of a Veblim good is that it's a product for which the
[2:15:09.200 --> 2:15:18.800]  more expensive it is, the more desirable it becomes. Um, and this idea certainly, um, this, this is the
[2:15:18.800 --> 2:15:23.120]  case for, for some luxury goods. I mean, I think where the confusion is it doesn't necessarily mean
[2:15:23.120 --> 2:15:29.760]  they sell more, right? A, a, a, a Hermes bag sells, they sell fewer bags and lose a ton,
[2:15:29.760 --> 2:15:36.320]  but they are way more desirable and they're way more, uh, a signifier. And they wouldn't be as
[2:15:36.320 --> 2:15:41.600]  desirable if they were priced exactly exactly exactly right. They would not become more, more,
[2:15:41.600 --> 2:15:46.480]  more popular. And so there's, there are, there are brands. Um, I think coaches is something like
[2:15:46.480 --> 2:15:51.120]  this where they've, they've vastly increased their sales. They've made a lot of money. Like coach
[2:15:51.120 --> 2:15:56.160]  has the whole like coach retail or, uh, uh, what's the word? I'll let coach outlet. And it's a
[2:15:56.160 --> 2:16:01.520]  very, it's a different, it's a different, uh, design, like all designs are different than actual
[2:16:01.520 --> 2:16:05.600]  coach stores, but they actually make most of their money there and they sell way more. There's lines
[2:16:05.600 --> 2:16:12.560]  out there, you know, uh, building all the time. Um, but it has absolutely, it weighs in my estimation,
[2:16:12.560 --> 2:16:17.360]  my observation, uh, and again, this is where I, I was growing my wife distracting me before,
[2:16:17.360 --> 2:16:23.520]  but this is where I owe her a lot. Uh, it's changed what coach means as a brand. It's become a
[2:16:23.520 --> 2:16:32.400]  lot less meaningful, a lot less of a signifier of, of, of anything, you know, of like a mid class,
[2:16:32.400 --> 2:16:37.040]  it's like a mid class brand instead of, uh, uh, absolutely. Absolutely. Not, not not class for people,
[2:16:37.040 --> 2:16:42.240]  but just where they are competitively with their, you know, that they're, it's, it's above,
[2:16:42.240 --> 2:16:47.040]  you know, it's more in line with like Michael Coarsers right exactly when, when I think 10, 15 years
[2:16:47.040 --> 2:16:54.000]  ago, it was, it was more on, you know, the low, still the lower end of luxury, but now it's not,
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:17:00.800]  it's, it's borderline luxury at all. And, um, and that's fine. It's worked out well for them as I
[2:17:00.800 --> 2:17:03.920]  understand it. I think they're, I think they're doing pretty well. Although I think they,
[2:17:03.920 --> 2:17:08.640]  I think it over the long run, I think they, they may be tapering off of it now, but, uh,
[2:17:08.640 --> 2:17:14.720]  but no, in, in, in China and in some like this, and this is like the, it's gotten a lot better,
[2:17:14.720 --> 2:17:20.480]  but especially even a year ago, the analysis of the iPhone in China was just so wildly off base,
[2:17:20.480 --> 2:17:24.080]  right? Like people when they have five C came out, there's all these articles saying,
[2:17:24.080 --> 2:17:29.040]  oh, a five C is equivalent to the average monthly wage in China. That's, that's a
[2:17:29.040 --> 2:17:33.760]  completely meaningless statistic. It means absolutely nothing because there's so much inequality,
[2:17:33.760 --> 2:17:37.440]  right? And there's so many people that by definition, there's a lot of people that are
[2:17:37.440 --> 2:17:44.720]  what make way more than the average, average monthly salary. And the iPhone, uh, is selling to
[2:17:44.720 --> 2:17:50.960]  those people and not just that, but in, in, in that culture and it's the same thing here in Taiwan,
[2:17:50.960 --> 2:17:54.560]  which is obviously, you know, it's Chinese, but I think a lot of Chinese influence cultures,
[2:17:54.560 --> 2:18:01.760]  the idea of displaying wealth, uh, is much more socially acceptable than it is in the West,
[2:18:01.760 --> 2:18:06.640]  right? To, to like mark, go back to ATP, like we owe them for this episode, but Mark will talk
[2:18:06.640 --> 2:18:11.360]  about all of you. He would judge someone that walked in with the gold phone and James on my,
[2:18:11.360 --> 2:18:16.160]  on the podcast with me said the same thing. Uh, it's the exact, yeah, Marko's example was,
[2:18:16.160 --> 2:18:21.040]  you think that next year at WWDC that we go out for beers at the house of shields or something,
[2:18:21.040 --> 2:18:25.840]  and it's anybody in our indie crowd going to be wearing a gold apple watch. And he said,
[2:18:25.840 --> 2:18:30.080]  I'd be embarrassed if I had, right, exactly. And which is a reasonable, it's totally a reasonable
[2:18:30.080 --> 2:18:34.480]  thing to say. And I know exactly what he's talking about, but I think I think he's wrong,
[2:18:34.480 --> 2:18:39.840]  I think there will be people wearing him. And, but I also think, though, that it would be something
[2:18:39.840 --> 2:18:44.720]  that it, it, it might carry a twinge of embarrassment in some context, whereas you're saying,
[2:18:44.720 --> 2:18:50.480]  like in Asia, it would not, you know, that there is, it's, there's, I, you know, can't put it
[2:18:50.480 --> 2:18:59.600]  better than you did, that it's different. I wouldn't be surprised if we see, again, Apple probably
[2:18:59.600 --> 2:19:04.320]  wouldn't break this down, but maybe they would, but like an incredible disparity in the breakdown
[2:19:04.320 --> 2:19:12.480]  of, you know, almost like an inversion, you know, just totally different chart of how many of
[2:19:12.480 --> 2:19:20.160]  which model are selling Apple Watch being off the charts different in Asia than in the West.
[2:19:20.160 --> 2:19:25.760]  Yeah, for sure. Well, I imagine just the color of iPhones, right? It is almost impossible to see
[2:19:25.760 --> 2:19:34.960]  an iPhone 5C or 5S here in Taiwan, that's not gold. Like if you see 10 iPhone 5S is 9 of them
[2:19:34.960 --> 2:19:42.240]  are gold. And that, and that's truly cosmetic, because it's not gold gold, it's gold color.
[2:19:42.240 --> 2:19:47.200]  Right. But that's, so that, I guess it's not perfect seeing the fire, but the idea of like gold
[2:19:47.200 --> 2:19:54.000]  especially is, is very meaningful. It's a very, like, there's all this, like all this stuff about
[2:19:54.000 --> 2:19:58.560]  it's weird, like the relationships of, of, with the Chinese with money is very, very different
[2:19:58.560 --> 2:20:02.160]  than the West. Like in the West, especially in America, there's this kind of, you know,
[2:20:02.160 --> 2:20:08.640]  puretiness, like, you know, you ought to be humble and, and, and hide your wealth and things like
[2:20:08.640 --> 2:20:13.360]  that, not at all the case here, like money and the idea of money is everywhere. Gifts are money,
[2:20:13.360 --> 2:20:19.440]  like the idea of giving presence is different. You give money. When you go to a wedding, for example,
[2:20:19.440 --> 2:20:23.200]  you bring an envelope, you give it to them, they pull out them, they have someone's at the door,
[2:20:23.200 --> 2:20:28.000]  they pull out the money, they count it and they write it down. So there's a list of how much
[2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:32.480]  everyone made it. And it's like, it's, they just do it right there. Like it's, it's, and it's not,
[2:20:32.480 --> 2:20:38.160]  it's not weird, right? You have Chinese New Year and you eat these dumplings that are meant to look
[2:20:38.160 --> 2:20:42.080]  like money, like old, old kind of money. So the idea is you can make more money in the next year.
[2:20:42.080 --> 2:20:48.080]  Like just, it sounds, I know it sounds totally bizarre to people in the West do have this like
[2:20:48.080 --> 2:20:54.320]  fixation with money, but it's not, it's not weird here. It's just like, that's just, it's the
[2:20:54.320 --> 2:21:00.640]  way it is. And, and the iPhone absolutely fits into this where people absolutely without a question
[2:21:01.520 --> 2:21:08.640]  cannot be disputed will buy an iPhone simply because it's the most expensive and it shows that you
[2:21:08.640 --> 2:21:14.480]  can afford an iPhone. And without a doubt, the gold watch will fit in here, even if it is disposable,
[2:21:14.480 --> 2:21:20.640]  even if it can't be replaced, people will buy a $5,000 gold watch because it's a five, it's a,
[2:21:20.640 --> 2:21:26.160]  it's a gold watch and it's an even more. So it's on your wrist all the time. People will see it
[2:21:26.160 --> 2:21:32.800]  all the time. And, and, and that's okay. Like, and that's, it's not frowned upon at by any means,
[2:21:32.800 --> 2:21:39.440]  it's, it's, it's something everyone aspires to. All right, there's two types of in broad strokes,
[2:21:39.440 --> 2:21:43.440]  two types of people who buy an expensive watch. There's the crowd, there's a type of person who
[2:21:43.440 --> 2:21:49.600]  buys one and selects one, probably a Rolex because Rolex is the by far the preeminent brand,
[2:21:49.600 --> 2:21:54.800]  but and selects not just any Rolex, but one that is God, you know, maybe diamonds around the
[2:21:54.800 --> 2:22:00.160]  bezel or something like that, because they want people to see that they're wearing a diamond
[2:22:00.160 --> 2:22:07.040]  bezel Rolex. And then there's the type who might spend even more, like $85,000 on a watch.
[2:22:07.040 --> 2:22:12.320]  I just saw one on her dinky that was 85 grand, but that it's like a watch guys watch. And nobody,
[2:22:12.320 --> 2:22:19.040]  nobody, no typical person would even notice that it's anything except other watch people. And
[2:22:19.040 --> 2:22:24.240]  it's, you know, maybe in a course of a week, only one person who would see you wearing a watch
[2:22:24.240 --> 2:22:28.240]  would know what it is. But that, to that, that person knows exactly what it is. And it's like a,
[2:22:28.240 --> 2:22:32.800]  like being in a secret society. Right. And I think that that, and so I think the gold apple watch
[2:22:32.800 --> 2:22:37.920]  is, is, that's not the second. The cold apple watch is the first, but it is, I've, I bought the
[2:22:37.920 --> 2:22:41.840]  gold apple, but it would be the second if we're modular. That's what's so interesting about it. Right.
[2:22:42.960 --> 2:22:46.400]  Well, I think the stainless steel is sort of that though. The stainless steel is because it's
[2:22:46.400 --> 2:22:50.720]  stainless steel. And a couple people have pointed this out. It's, it's hard to see online. It's the
[2:22:50.720 --> 2:22:54.880]  sort of thing that does not photograph well. Jewelry in particular, it never photographed well.
[2:22:56.320 --> 2:23:01.280]  But the stainless steel is polished. And it is shiny. I can vouch for that. I haven't seen it and
[2:23:01.280 --> 2:23:07.440]  tried one on. And the aluminum's apple sports watch is more like, it's, I don't know if it is
[2:23:07.440 --> 2:23:13.360]  brushed aluminum or whatever the sandblasted thing, whatever they do, you know, like to the brand new
[2:23:13.360 --> 2:23:18.880]  iPhone six, you know, it's, it's not a polished shiny material. It's, you know, it's, it's matte.
[2:23:18.880 --> 2:23:23.280]  But at a glance, it would be very difficult to see whether somebody is wearing a stainless steel
[2:23:23.280 --> 2:23:28.880]  one or the aluminum one. And the bands are, to answer a very common question, the bands are
[2:23:28.880 --> 2:23:36.000]  interchangeable between all of them. Now 38 and 42 millimeters take different sized bands. But if you
[2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:42.080]  buy a stainless steel apple watch, you could buy, you know, you, you can fit any of the other bands
[2:23:42.080 --> 2:23:49.040]  on it that are meant for the larger size. Right. New, I think that's the, the band thing,
[2:23:49.040 --> 2:23:54.240]  are they going to come with like, it seems as just on the site that the aluminum watches will
[2:23:54.240 --> 2:23:57.760]  be available with a certain set of bands and the stainless steel ones will be available with a
[2:23:57.760 --> 2:24:02.480]  different set. And I get you can change them after the fact. But when you buy it or up front,
[2:24:02.480 --> 2:24:07.440]  are you, your options limited? I don't know. I don't think they've answered that. And that gets
[2:24:07.440 --> 2:24:11.760]  into the retail thing. I mean, we're pushing on the two and a half hour mark here. So kind of like,
[2:24:11.760 --> 2:24:18.400]  this is hurry. But I do think that the retail question is fascinating in terms of how are you going,
[2:24:18.400 --> 2:24:21.840]  how, what are your configuration options going to be and how are they going to set that up in
[2:24:21.840 --> 2:24:26.560]  the store? And I said it right away. I said, right away, I thought, man, this is why Angela
[2:24:26.560 --> 2:24:32.640]  aren't, why they hired her and be why she took the job because it's, you know, there's a clear
[2:24:33.440 --> 2:24:39.760]  enormous challenge ahead to turn the Apple stores as we know them into a place where you would buy
[2:24:39.760 --> 2:24:44.240]  stuff like this. And then how much are they going to keep in stock? We're going to be able to buy
[2:24:44.240 --> 2:24:49.280]  the gold one in an Apple store. Are they going to sell them at places like Tourno, you know, places
[2:24:49.280 --> 2:24:58.240]  that sell, you know, a variety of, you know, like Tourno is a reseller of wristwatches. But you
[2:24:58.240 --> 2:25:03.360]  can buy different brands. It's not just just Rolex or just don't make a or whatever. They, you know,
[2:25:03.360 --> 2:25:07.680]  would there be like an Apple kiosk in a corner where you buy the edition? Well, here, here's
[2:25:07.680 --> 2:25:14.320]  I don't know. It was rumored. It was rumored before the event that Apple was in negotiation
[2:25:14.320 --> 2:25:21.360]  was talking with Nordstrom about the Apple pay thing. But Nordstrom wasn't, wasn't up on the screen
[2:25:21.360 --> 2:25:25.200]  when they talked about it. They talked about, you know, several other retailers, but not Nordstrom.
[2:25:26.320 --> 2:25:32.000]  Nordstrom actually makes a lot of sense for a gold watch. Like the Nordstrom plays, they don't
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  play in the very high end, but they play in the medium and of, especially when it comes to bags
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  and stuff like that in luxury. They sell luxury goods. They don't sell the crazy expensive luxury goods
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:48.560]  where they sell kind of the mid-range luxury. And I wonder, right, they don't have the $85,000 watch,
[2:25:48.560 --> 2:25:54.480]  but they might have easily could have a $5,000. Right, exactly. And I think that's, I wonder if,
[2:25:55.360 --> 2:26:01.200]  you know, I think you went to or I linked to the, the, the Robert X crink crinkling. And I know,
[2:26:01.200 --> 2:26:04.720]  I know he's a controversial figure, but I thought this particular column was, it was very interesting
[2:26:04.720 --> 2:26:10.640]  where he surmised that the gold would mostly be at jewelers and would, yeah, I think he's back
[2:26:10.640 --> 2:26:15.760]  on his good meds or something. I thought so. Yeah, I got, I got some flack for even looking to
[2:26:15.760 --> 2:26:20.720]  of at all. But the other thing too is this is an advantage. I suspect Apple did want to be there
[2:26:20.720 --> 2:26:25.040]  by the holidays just because who wouldn't? But I think this is an advantage to being in the spring
[2:26:25.040 --> 2:26:30.000]  where you can't really rework the stores in the room to the holidays, right? It's, it's just a
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:36.720]  madness in there. Whereas in the spring, there's a lot more latitude to, to move stuff around.
[2:26:36.720 --> 2:26:40.400]  I don't even think they came close. Whatever, at whatever point where they thought maybe they would
[2:26:40.400 --> 2:26:45.440]  launch in time for holiday 2014, that was long time ago, maybe even a year ago. I would be shocked
[2:26:45.440 --> 2:26:49.440]  if even at the beginning of this year, there was any hope that they would do it. You know, I,
[2:26:49.440 --> 2:26:53.360]  I think, you know, and honestly, I mean, just think about just when did Angela aren't come on board,
[2:26:53.360 --> 2:26:56.720]  I don't think she came on board full time until June or May or something like that.
[2:26:57.840 --> 2:27:02.480]  Oh, that reminds me one thing about the retail thing. Um, the, the most interesting, I think we talked
[2:27:02.480 --> 2:27:06.720]  about this on the last time I was on the show. But one of the most interesting hires they made was
[2:27:06.720 --> 2:27:11.360]  the LVM H guy. And what was interesting about it was that he wasn't a product guy. He was a channel
[2:27:11.360 --> 2:27:16.800]  guy. And by channel, I mean, like where your products are sold. So he helped negotiate like for
[2:27:17.680 --> 2:27:23.200]  tag, tag humor, like where tag humor watches were sold, which meant he had lots of relationships
[2:27:23.200 --> 2:27:28.480]  with, um, with places like Nordstrom with department stores. So here in Asia, like it's all
[2:27:28.480 --> 2:27:32.480]  department stores, like there are no malls per se. They're, they're, they're department stores where
[2:27:32.480 --> 2:27:38.960]  it's one entity, but within that it was like sub shop, basically. And all these have luxury goods and
[2:27:38.960 --> 2:27:44.320]  they have boutiques and stuff like that within, within the thing. And there's definitely a, it's a
[2:27:44.320 --> 2:27:50.240]  different sort of retail environment than anyone at Apple would have had experience with, with
[2:27:50.240 --> 2:27:56.960]  previously LVM H for it, for those who don't know is the Louis Vuitton Moa parent company
[2:27:56.960 --> 2:28:01.360]  Moa fantasy. Yeah, Moa at Champagne. Right. So it's had a Henness and then Hennessy, uh,
[2:28:01.360 --> 2:28:06.560]  Cognac. Um, right. But they have a whole portfolio stuff. I think they have Dior. They have like a
[2:28:06.560 --> 2:28:14.400]  whole, they have a ton of brands. Um, super interesting company actually. Uh, but, uh, that hire was
[2:28:14.400 --> 2:28:20.720]  interesting because it, because of the channel angle, um, right. All of this experience, all of
[2:28:20.720 --> 2:28:26.800]  his experience points to the, the thing I, I, I can't imagine. I mean, anybody can always change course
[2:28:26.800 --> 2:28:31.280]  careers, you know, change careers course and do something different. But if he's going to do
[2:28:31.280 --> 2:28:36.800]  anything based on what he did at LVM H, it would be getting the Apple watch into other retailer.
[2:28:36.800 --> 2:28:40.240]  Right. And, and this sort of retailers that would sell tag, you were watches.
[2:28:41.360 --> 2:28:46.000]  Right. And tag humor is not selling three or, or you would, the places that are selling tag,
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:52.320]  you were watches are not selling swatches like 300, 300 dollar watches. So a few more points. Uh,
[2:28:52.320 --> 2:28:58.880]  when I wanted to hit, uh, I think the last one from ATP follow up, but, uh, John Syracuse, uh, uh,
[2:28:59.840 --> 2:29:05.200]  I think he said, you know, it's, it's, it turns a quantity. Clearly the, the sport addition is,
[2:29:05.200 --> 2:29:10.080]  is going to outsell the, the gold addition. I keep calling him addition. And they call, the Apple
[2:29:10.080 --> 2:29:15.920]  calls them collections to avoid calling it the Apple. So, so the Apple sport collection is going
[2:29:15.920 --> 2:29:23.360]  to outsell the Apple addition collection in terms of quantity. Uh, but I am not entirely sure at
[2:29:23.360 --> 2:29:30.240]  all that in terms of, uh, and this is in contrast to his take, I don't know that Apple addition
[2:29:30.240 --> 2:29:36.480]  collection might be the one that makes the most revenue. Well, the most, I think it'll be so,
[2:29:37.120 --> 2:29:42.160]  yeah, profit and revenue that it, you know, that they're going to, it is not just, uh,
[2:29:42.160 --> 2:29:47.920]  uh, even if it's, I think it's going to sell more than 1% of the units. But even if it only sells
[2:29:47.920 --> 2:29:53.840]  two, three, four percent, I think it's going to be so expensive that it will, it will easily be,
[2:29:54.640 --> 2:30:04.160]  you know, 10 or 20 times more profitable than the $349 one. And so even if it only sells 5% of the
[2:30:04.160 --> 2:30:11.120]  units worldwide, that's 50% of the revenue. No, for sure. And the other thing too is if,
[2:30:11.120 --> 2:30:15.840]  if this is another reason to presume that Apple is being more ambitious than less when it comes
[2:30:15.840 --> 2:30:21.040]  to the functionality of the watch, because if it turns out to be a watch that you want to wear
[2:30:21.040 --> 2:30:26.720]  every day, um, you're almost certainly going to buy additional bands, right? And, and right,
[2:30:26.720 --> 2:30:31.520]  some of those bands are not going to be cheap. And especially if you're buying a gold addition
[2:30:31.520 --> 2:30:37.120]  and you actually use it and you actually becomes, it becomes a regular part of your life.
[2:30:37.120 --> 2:30:42.080]  Um, you're going to want to have different bands for, to make it fit in different occasions.
[2:30:42.080 --> 2:30:48.400]  And, uh, what, what, what's, what's so Apple about this and you, you nailed this in a wink yesterday,
[2:30:48.400 --> 2:30:52.400]  um, about, you know, there is the, you winked article where I think I'm here for it. He said they,
[2:30:52.400 --> 2:30:59.360]  they don't want to cannibalize phones. No, not, not only is it, not only is it key to Apple's longevity
[2:30:59.360 --> 2:31:03.680]  and success that they are willing to cannibalize their own products. What's so brilliant about Apple
[2:31:03.680 --> 2:31:09.280]  is they have always cannibalize their products with more profitable products. And, and, and I
[2:31:09.280 --> 2:31:16.240]  pad, it has better margins than a Mac. Uh, an iPhone not only has better mart margins than an iPod,
[2:31:16.240 --> 2:31:21.040]  it's also way more expensive. So they're getting more on the top and bottom line. Like, if you're
[2:31:21.040 --> 2:31:24.000]  going to cannibalize your products, it wouldn't it be great if you could do it with an even more
[2:31:24.000 --> 2:31:31.200]  expensive object. And if you're talking about having an eye, a watch that is the center of your
[2:31:31.200 --> 2:31:38.960]  existence in five, six years from now. And oh, by the way, you paid $2,000 or $5,000 for it,
[2:31:38.960 --> 2:31:45.280]  plus a bunch of like $500 accessories. Um, Apple's pretty okay with you using your iPhone,
[2:31:45.280 --> 2:31:50.800]  just a little bit less than you did before. Yeah. One of the things that I'm, it turns like you said,
[2:31:50.800 --> 2:31:55.760]  are you, how customizable is it going to be when you buy it? I presume if you order it online,
[2:31:55.760 --> 2:32:01.600]  it's going to be completely customizable. You get whatever band on whichever one you want. I don't
[2:32:01.600 --> 2:32:06.880]  know. But if you go in and they only have a couple of presets set up that you've, you know, picked
[2:32:06.880 --> 2:32:10.240]  from these to start with. And if you want to buy a second band, buy a second band, one of the
[2:32:10.240 --> 2:32:14.320]  things that's interesting to me and I don't know how it's going to work out is the, have you noticed
[2:32:14.320 --> 2:32:20.080]  that the, the side of the digital crown, like the part, if you were going to press it in, the digital
[2:32:20.080 --> 2:32:29.440]  crown is colored to match the band. Like when I saw one, like the smaller size with the red,
[2:32:29.440 --> 2:32:34.800]  like a rich maroon band, the button wasn't black. It was maroon. It matched the band. Right.
[2:32:34.800 --> 2:32:39.280]  But only not on all the additions. So sport, for example, they're all the same. I think that's
[2:32:39.840 --> 2:32:48.480]  the addition. Yeah. It's it on. Yeah. The addition addition. So that says to me that they're going to
[2:32:48.480 --> 2:32:56.640]  be, um, that they're going to be matched. Yeah, sold as a unit with a band. And you can buy another
[2:32:56.640 --> 2:33:00.800]  band, but then like if you buy like a white band, you're still going to have the red button on the,
[2:33:00.800 --> 2:33:06.480]  on the side. Uh, who knows? But I did think that was interesting and it jumped out at me and I don't,
[2:33:06.480 --> 2:33:11.760]  I don't know. Um, yeah, I'm just looking through the site definitely. Only the addition that has
[2:33:11.760 --> 2:33:18.960]  different color buttons. The stainless steel is all black and the sport is always just aluminum.
[2:33:18.960 --> 2:33:25.200]  So that's another kind of signifier of which of which one you bought. Right. Um,
[2:33:28.480 --> 2:33:34.480]  I did notice I saw Johnny I've at the event and he was wearing the addition addition,
[2:33:34.480 --> 2:33:42.480]  but he added on a sport band. Um, I couldn't tell. I saw him on stage. And I also saw him walking
[2:33:42.480 --> 2:33:49.760]  by. I saw Tim Cook walking by. Uh, he was either wearing the stainless steel one or the sport one.
[2:33:49.760 --> 2:33:54.720]  Again, like I said, at a glance, you know, while he's walking into motion, it was too hard to see
[2:33:54.720 --> 2:33:59.200]  how shiny it was. But he also was wearing the sport band, which I thought was kind of interesting
[2:33:59.200 --> 2:34:04.800]  that they, they both wore the sport band, even with the one that I think is going to be multiple
[2:34:04.800 --> 2:34:10.000]  thousands of dollars. That is interesting. I mean, you think that they would have at least a prototype
[2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:13.040]  in the lap that they could wear, even if they weren't, you know, widely available.
[2:34:14.240 --> 2:34:18.400]  All right. Well, no, they, well, they had the bands, you know, there for us in the press to try,
[2:34:18.400 --> 2:34:22.960]  you know, we could try on all the bands. Uh, you know, but the ones that they're wearing is like
[2:34:22.960 --> 2:34:28.240]  they're, they're actual daily use as they, you know, test the things. Uh, at least at the event,
[2:34:28.240 --> 2:34:34.640]  they, you know, wore the, the, the, every man's watch, you know, the band. All right. Last question
[2:34:34.640 --> 2:34:37.760]  I have, I don't know, watch. And I think this is one I haven't seen anybody talk about,
[2:34:37.760 --> 2:34:40.800]  but I thought it would be, I thought it's pretty interesting. Where do you think they're going to
[2:34:40.800 --> 2:34:50.160]  assemble them? Yeah, I've gotten this question to eyes. It, I think it depends on the mod. I want to
[2:34:50.160 --> 2:34:56.080]  say, I don't know. It's, it's, because especially sports sport sport, I believe will be assembled
[2:34:56.080 --> 2:35:03.760]  in China at Foxconn or similar type place. I don't know that you can sell a $10,000 watch that
[2:35:03.760 --> 2:35:08.800]  is assembled in China. I think in the same way that when in my article, I said like one reason
[2:35:08.800 --> 2:35:12.800]  I think they called it Apple Watch instead of I watch is I watch sounds like a cutesy thing that
[2:35:12.800 --> 2:35:19.600]  costs $350 does not sound like something piece of jewelry you spend $10,000 on. Uh, assembled in
[2:35:19.600 --> 2:35:28.320]  China does not compute to me for a $5,000 $10,000 product. That and it was, and it's a big,
[2:35:28.320 --> 2:35:32.560]  and for all their comparisons to the watch world, that's a big deal where watches are made,
[2:35:32.560 --> 2:35:41.520]  you know, Swiss made is, is the gold standard for, uh, you know, it's just like a sign of quality,
[2:35:42.320 --> 2:35:45.520]  you know, it's a badge of quality. It's a badge of honor for the whole country in Switzerland.
[2:35:45.520 --> 2:35:52.880]  And they certainly obviously been making, making efforts in this regard. And especially if they're,
[2:35:54.080 --> 2:36:01.520]  um, I mean, to see it, how many pieces, the more, the more that, especially with this chip,
[2:36:01.520 --> 2:36:08.720]  right, because a lot, a lot of the manual labor, um, when it comes to building a computer is still
[2:36:08.720 --> 2:36:13.440]  like on the motherboard. And it's still like, like a lot of, a lot of it's like is done by hand,
[2:36:13.440 --> 2:36:19.440]  because it requires very precise, you know, sort of invitation. And there's been, there's been
[2:36:19.440 --> 2:36:22.800]  report, you just do a search on Google about like two of them on the board factory. I think
[2:36:22.800 --> 2:36:28.640]  Anantek has done, has done some of these before. Um, like it's very, very manual. And that's where
[2:36:28.640 --> 2:36:35.360]  the payoff for having a lower cost labor force pays off in this sort of stuff. If you're building
[2:36:35.360 --> 2:36:40.880]  the entire computer on a chip, that's, you know, completely wrapped up in resin. That's,
[2:36:40.880 --> 2:36:47.360]  by definition, the computer is being built entirely by a machine. And it doesn't really matter
[2:36:47.360 --> 2:36:53.600]  where you run a machine. Um, it's going to cost, you know, obviously the, the operator costs will,
[2:36:53.600 --> 2:36:57.600]  will vary. But the, the sort of person that could operate that sort of machine is going to be
[2:36:57.600 --> 2:37:00.880]  almost expensive in China as they are, as they are in the United States.
[2:37:03.040 --> 2:37:08.720]  All right. And I, so I could either see that, that this is going to be a huge shift, you know,
[2:37:08.720 --> 2:37:13.280]  that the Mac Pro is just the beginning, but that maybe they'll be assembled in the US.
[2:37:14.080 --> 2:37:18.240]  And I don't know. And at the very least, I wouldn't be surprised if the addition,
[2:37:19.040 --> 2:37:25.040]  addition is assembled in the US. Because again, if you're going to sell it for $10,000,
[2:37:25.040 --> 2:37:32.880]  they can afford, uh, you know, the difference in hourly wage for the people doing the actual assembly.
[2:37:32.880 --> 2:37:37.600]  So do you think, and it, you know, it adds to the entire, like it's, that's an intangible factor,
[2:37:37.600 --> 2:37:44.560]  right? Which I think you're driving at it. It means something, um, to be, to have that made,
[2:37:44.560 --> 2:37:49.200]  made in USA, made USA label, even to people who aren't in the US, right? It's, it's, it's,
[2:37:49.200 --> 2:37:53.520]  yeah, you made it the point to the watch thing. I guess my question for you is, is Apple,
[2:37:53.520 --> 2:37:58.640]  who is Apple targeting? Are they targeting people who don't wear watches, but do carry iPhones?
[2:37:58.640 --> 2:38:02.240]  Or do you think they are very much targeting people who wear watches today?
[2:38:03.680 --> 2:38:07.040]  I think that they are. I don't think they would have invited, I think it's both though.
[2:38:07.040 --> 2:38:10.800]  I think that they, they see it as an opportunity. They see people who don't wear watches as,
[2:38:10.800 --> 2:38:16.240]  as, as, uh, I think it's both. It's, you know, hey, that you, if you don't wear a watch day,
[2:38:16.240 --> 2:38:20.480]  your wrist is already open. So we don't have to convince you to switch watches. We just have
[2:38:20.480 --> 2:38:25.040]  to convince you to buy one. Your wrist is already there waiting for it. And I think they're
[2:38:25.040 --> 2:38:30.000]  absolutely courting, uh, people who are already wear watches. I don't think there's any other
[2:38:30.000 --> 2:38:34.320]  explanation for the time they spent in the event talking about the eye watches accuracy,
[2:38:34.320 --> 2:38:40.880]  which is baffling to me at first, because, of course, it's accurate. All computers with a clock
[2:38:40.880 --> 2:38:48.560]  are incredibly accurate compared to, you know, mechanical watches. Um, you know, my iPhone doesn't
[2:38:48.560 --> 2:38:55.600]  lose time. I mean, this stuff about 50 millisecond, uh, precision, uh, is a little crazy,
[2:38:55.600 --> 2:39:00.080]  but I think it's somehow trying to set it up as a watches, a watch guy's watch.
[2:39:00.080 --> 2:39:04.160]  Yeah, but I mean, the watch guy doesn't have a watch because it's accurate. That, that, that, I'm
[2:39:04.160 --> 2:39:10.000]  still confused. I know. Um, I, I, I, uh, it's just, yeah, I don't know. I'm still not sure who that
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:15.040]  was for. Well, I, I think they were trying to weigh on the idea that this is a watch like, you know,
[2:39:15.040 --> 2:39:19.520]  like, there, there is that is a reason to actually reason to buy it is because it's now that I
[2:39:19.520 --> 2:39:25.040]  think about it. It wasn't actually, I guess it wasn't for watched people. It was for the lay
[2:39:25.040 --> 2:39:30.000]  person's expectation for what a watch person would get exactly. They weren't actually speaking
[2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:34.800]  directly to watch people. They were expecting, they're talking to like the writers in the audience
[2:39:34.800 --> 2:39:40.480]  who don't know the watch world, but their imagination of it is that it's, you know, of course time,
[2:39:40.480 --> 2:39:47.760]  time accuracy is important. No, I think, uh, to me, I, I really think the most like this question
[2:39:47.760 --> 2:39:54.080]  of modularity is, is absolutely, is, is unbelievably fascinating. And I think we'll completely change
[2:39:54.080 --> 2:40:01.840]  if it's true, we completely change the entire expectation and idea of what this watch is. Because
[2:40:01.840 --> 2:40:08.880]  if it's not modular, if it's just a, a consumer electronics device, disposal of consumer electronics
[2:40:08.880 --> 2:40:15.840]  device, I don't think they are really targeting watch people. Um, because they watch people don't
[2:40:15.840 --> 2:40:22.480]  buy watches. They buy watches for very like specific reasons that would not be addressed by an
[2:40:22.480 --> 2:40:27.280]  Apple watch. And in this case, the addition version, the gold version really is just all about
[2:40:27.280 --> 2:40:31.840]  skimming off money from people who are willing to throw it at Apple in Asia. And which is, I guess
[2:40:31.840 --> 2:40:37.040]  it's, it's fine. That's fine. It's a fine reason to do that. It's kind of a, a unsatisfying,
[2:40:37.680 --> 2:40:44.160]  unsatisfying response. On the other hand, if it is modular and you're, when you buy an addition,
[2:40:44.160 --> 2:40:49.040]  you're buying something that Apple is saying will be good for at least what 10 years or maybe
[2:40:49.040 --> 2:40:56.800]  ideally a lifetime. Um, now you actually are very much targeting your, your targeting people who
[2:40:56.800 --> 2:41:02.800]  value watches for their entrant like because of because it, you're targeting watch guys. And,
[2:41:03.920 --> 2:41:10.240]  and I think it's about cutting off future watch guys from becoming watch guys and women watch people
[2:41:10.240 --> 2:41:14.960]  that that it's, you know, for young people who've never worn one and as they get more money and they
[2:41:14.960 --> 2:41:18.240]  become more successful and they can afford more expensive things that they're not even going to
[2:41:18.240 --> 2:41:22.880]  consider a traditional watch because they can go this route. And they've already gotten in the
[2:41:22.880 --> 2:41:28.080]  habit of wearing one from the sport edition. They bought when they were, you know, in the 350.
[2:41:28.080 --> 2:41:32.720]  Well, not, not just that, but the reason to know, I completely agree. Um, when I think it just
[2:41:32.720 --> 2:41:38.240]  occurs to me is a reason why Apple might want to do the modular thing is just speaking for myself.
[2:41:38.880 --> 2:41:44.080]  Uh, if it's, if it's a throwaway, I'll buy the sport. If it's modular, I'll buy the stainless steel,
[2:41:44.080 --> 2:41:50.880]  like it's, like it's, it's, it's pretty obvious. And I suspect that thinking it's not just
[2:41:50.880 --> 2:41:56.640]  that they'll put a watch guys, but I think their ability to, to lever people up to a higher
[2:41:56.640 --> 2:42:01.600]  margin product will be drastically enhanced. But if they were able to pull that off.
[2:42:02.400 --> 2:42:07.920]  And it would explain why that's the, the, the mid price tier is the one that's being show,
[2:42:07.920 --> 2:42:12.400]  you know, established as the regular TL total, the one that just has the plan.
[2:42:12.400 --> 2:42:17.520]  And it, this, this, this, this removes all these, I think this makes all these questions that
[2:42:17.520 --> 2:42:23.760]  people are objecting to with the watch of the why much less objectionable because now it's not
[2:42:23.760 --> 2:42:30.880]  just that Apple is selling a, a, a throwaway device. Like, because the, the question of why would
[2:42:30.880 --> 2:42:35.760]  you spend money on this is very much tied into the question of why would I spend money on a product
[2:42:35.760 --> 2:42:41.760]  that is going to be worthless in two years? That question changes very fundamentally. If you know
[2:42:41.760 --> 2:42:47.200]  you're buying something that has longevity, like the, the sort of thing, like it tells time and
[2:42:47.200 --> 2:42:52.800]  just has it, it just has a disposable component. Right. Yeah. It's enough to just be a watch then
[2:42:52.800 --> 2:42:56.160]  if you know it last long time. It's enough to just be a health tracker when you know it last
[2:42:56.160 --> 2:43:02.720]  long time. I don't understand. I don't not fully aware of the laws surrounding how, how and when
[2:43:02.720 --> 2:43:07.760]  things need to be said where they're made. It's, it's my understanding though that like it's,
[2:43:07.760 --> 2:43:12.720]  you have to, you have to, like things that are made in China have to say made in China would
[2:43:12.720 --> 2:43:18.480]  to be sold in the US and around the world. It's not, you know, Apple doesn't necessarily choose to
[2:43:18.480 --> 2:43:24.320]  print a design by Apple and California assembled in China on all this devices. Like that's,
[2:43:24.320 --> 2:43:28.720]  there's a legal obligation there. The Apple watch that they've shown has no printed
[2:43:28.720 --> 2:43:33.040]  indication of where they're made. There's nothing. And if you look at the case back where they
[2:43:33.040 --> 2:43:38.960]  have all this nice type stamped into it doesn't say that. Most watches say it on the dial.
[2:43:38.960 --> 2:43:44.560]  At the bottom of the dial, it'll say made in Japan or or Swiss made Japanese movement.
[2:43:46.800 --> 2:43:53.680]  Can they do that in software? I don't know. And and if it's modular, can they have the S1
[2:43:54.720 --> 2:44:02.800]  made in Japan in a Foxconn factory sealed up and shipped to the US and have the, have it put
[2:44:02.800 --> 2:44:09.360]  into the watch over here? What, what, what, what, what does that mean? Is that if, you know, how much
[2:44:09.360 --> 2:44:15.200]  of it, if the whole S1 was manufactured in China, can they still say that the watch is assembled
[2:44:15.200 --> 2:44:21.040]  in the US because the sapphire and the band and the battery and everything was snapped into place
[2:44:21.040 --> 2:44:27.280]  by someone in a, yes, the answer is yes. The iPhone says made in China, but actually the value
[2:44:27.280 --> 2:44:33.520]  of the iPhone, Taiwan and Korea, especially make way more money off of every iPhone than China does.
[2:44:34.640 --> 2:44:40.240]  The made in China applies to just the final assembly. And so they could assemble in a way,
[2:44:40.240 --> 2:44:44.640]  I'm sure it'd be the case. Like I mean, Taiwan is like even more sort of day like
[2:44:45.440 --> 2:44:50.640]  is very much tied up in the iPhone. No tons of the components are made here. I'm sure it would be
[2:44:50.640 --> 2:44:56.880]  a similar thing with, with the, with the watch, but all that matters is the final assembly.
[2:44:58.240 --> 2:45:04.080]  I think, I think then I really do think that at least the addition and I think maybe even the
[2:45:04.080 --> 2:45:07.680]  stainless will be assembled in the US. And that's something that they could add later. Like
[2:45:07.680 --> 2:45:10.960]  because they had, they have the printing on the back. I would imagine that they would put it
[2:45:10.960 --> 2:45:15.040]  there if they did, but there's no reason for them to have it now because it's not, it's not for
[2:45:15.040 --> 2:45:20.640]  sale on the prototypes, right, not for sale. But I just don't see how you can sell a high-end watch
[2:45:20.640 --> 2:45:25.200]  that's made in China. And I know that that sort of thinking kind of did in the Swiss industry in the
[2:45:25.200 --> 2:45:29.600]  70s, like when they had their dark ages, when quartz watches first became a thing, one of the
[2:45:29.600 --> 2:45:33.120]  reasons they wrote them off was that they were all made in Japan. And they were like, nobody's
[2:45:33.120 --> 2:45:38.560]  going to buy a watch from Japan. Japan means crap. You know, it was, you know, the watch industry
[2:45:38.560 --> 2:45:43.440]  ran into the same Japanese buzz saw that the car automotive industry did, you know, nobody's going
[2:45:43.440 --> 2:45:49.040]  to buy Japanese cars. Japanese stuff is a junk. And, you know, there's that thinking that made in
[2:45:49.040 --> 2:45:54.800]  China is sort of a badge of, well, not a shame, but it's not a badge of honor. It doesn't stand for
[2:45:54.800 --> 2:46:00.960]  quality. Made in China just means, well, everything's made in China. Made in the USA means something.
[2:46:00.960 --> 2:46:06.320]  Right. And the thing is, is that the difference with the watch industry in the 70s was
[2:46:06.320 --> 2:46:11.920]  their, there was no like, it was all, it was all Switzerland. And so this was completely new,
[2:46:11.920 --> 2:46:17.920]  whereas Apple would be entering an environment now where their, the expectation of their being
[2:46:17.920 --> 2:46:24.960]  a low end is already there. And so whereas the watch, like the Swiss industry had to deal with,
[2:46:26.400 --> 2:46:30.800]  basically there was a big watch market they owned it all. And suddenly this whole,
[2:46:31.520 --> 2:46:35.520]  in like we've talked about before, like the consumer market, there's, it's bifurcated,
[2:46:35.520 --> 2:46:39.120]  it's bifurcated between the high end and the low end. The low end cares only about price.
[2:46:39.120 --> 2:46:43.280]  And suddenly there's a new option for price at the low end and they just couldn't respond.
[2:46:43.280 --> 2:46:46.240]  Apple, that's not going to be a surprise for Apple. There are going to be,
[2:46:46.240 --> 2:46:51.520]  there, everyone knows that that's the case. And those products are already on the market. There's
[2:46:51.520 --> 2:46:56.800]  already the wear devices there. I'm not sure if that made sense, but that made sense in my head.
[2:46:59.280 --> 2:47:03.440]  Well, that's a good point. I made a wrap this up. This is possibly record breaking in line,
[2:47:03.440 --> 2:47:08.160]  but there's so much to talk about. Can't even imagine that I thought last week, maybe I'd get to
[2:47:08.160 --> 2:47:15.600]  the watch with Renee. Ben Thompson, thank you so much for being here. Everybody can read Ben on a
[2:47:15.600 --> 2:47:24.400]  daily basis, effectively at your website's. Secretary, yes, I have post a couple of free articles
[2:47:24.400 --> 2:47:31.840]  a week and then I have the for pay daily update. And it's well worth it. It is great stuff.
[2:47:31.840 --> 2:47:36.160]  You've been killing it all year. You have perfect example too of that thing. I linked to it
[2:47:36.160 --> 2:47:40.000]  this week of the best way to be right all the time, or most of the time is to be willing to change
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:46.320]  your mind. You change your mind on the watch in, of course, the two weeks. It's true. I have too,
[2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:52.080]  you know, but I mean, it's a high compliment because it's, you know, it's human nature not to,
[2:47:52.080 --> 2:47:55.760]  you know, we want to be right at the first time. And it's more important to just keep things.
[2:47:55.760 --> 2:48:00.800]  Well, it's not, we both might be wrong too. I think that's what's that's what's so it's almost
[2:48:00.800 --> 2:48:04.800]  like I've already written four things about it. And I feel like I could, I'm always worried about
[2:48:04.800 --> 2:48:12.160]  people being bored, but that's what's so we haven't had something of the iPad kind of. But I feel
[2:48:12.160 --> 2:48:18.960]  this is what makes this more compelling than the iPad for me is that it's smaller. And to me,
[2:48:18.960 --> 2:48:27.440]  I think that's that's important. Like it makes it a potentially more meaningful device because
[2:48:27.440 --> 2:48:38.000]  portability will always be a key constraint. And it's just so fascinating. Yeah. Yeah, I've had
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:43.680]  it was not like a wow, I can't believe they could make this right exactly. And whereas I think
[2:48:43.680 --> 2:48:49.040]  the watch is going right into what that means. And people criticize Apple not being a lie. But
[2:48:49.040 --> 2:48:54.160]  if you think about it, if you think about it, the there's two alternatives. One is that they
[2:48:54.160 --> 2:49:01.200]  don't know. Two is that they're so far they're thinking is so far ahead of where our expectations
[2:49:01.200 --> 2:49:08.560]  are that we just like, we we can't catch up. And what's it fascinating is one, it could go either
[2:49:08.560 --> 2:49:13.760]  way, which is makes it really interesting. But two, if they are so far ahead, there's just like
[2:49:13.760 --> 2:49:17.920]  there's so much green field to even imagine what might be possible and what might be coming.
[2:49:17.920 --> 2:49:22.800]  And no, I haven't been this like, I don't want to say obsessed, but just like constantly turning
[2:49:22.800 --> 2:49:29.680]  over my head, what what a product could be in a very long time. Yeah. Exciting stuff to come.
[2:49:29.680 --> 2:49:34.320]  All right. Let me thank my three sponsors. Great sponsors this week. We got you bar from
