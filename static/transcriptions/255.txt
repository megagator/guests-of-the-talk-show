[00:00.000 --> 00:05.040]  I'll tell you what, I don't understand how people who like, let's just say like, like a
[00:05.040 --> 00:11.600]  Stephen Colbert or Jimmy Kimmel or who have you, Alan DeGeneres, how did how the hell do they do a
[00:11.600 --> 00:18.400]  show every day? Because I do one show. And it you know, it in our world, it's kind of a big deal.
[00:18.400 --> 00:25.520]  It is a beautiful theater. It's 1100 people, I feel an immense amount of pressure. And then I do
[00:25.520 --> 00:32.000]  it. And it goes off. And then I feel like that's it for the month. Like, yeah, I don't understand
[00:32.000 --> 00:35.440]  how these people come back. And then they're like, Well, tomorrow, I'll do the same thing.
[00:35.440 --> 00:40.240]  So one thing is they've got, they got a big staff, and that the staff helps them prepare and do some
[00:40.240 --> 00:45.280]  of the the strain that maybe that you and Amy have to do for this. And and I don't know, just
[00:45.280 --> 00:49.280]  classes do anything, but just sort of smile and then read the intro. You know, I mean, like,
[00:49.280 --> 00:52.800]  if there's anything that slips through Amy's fingers, he's there. He's there to catch it.
[00:52.800 --> 00:58.160]  So that's part of it. I think also, and I remember listening to Letterman talk about this, like,
[00:58.160 --> 01:04.160]  it's like, it's like being a long distance runner, or being a runner. You build up some,
[01:04.160 --> 01:08.720]  some strength, you know, but if you do it every day, you get those muscles and you're like,
[01:08.720 --> 01:13.280]  you're able to pace yourself. That said, I also got the impression, especially from Letterman,
[01:13.280 --> 01:17.120]  that after even, you know, doing four days, five shows in four days, because they would,
[01:17.120 --> 01:21.760]  they would require a fifth show. So they only work four days that he was kind of destroyed
[01:21.760 --> 01:27.520]  for the weekend, that that was part of it was was that. And yeah, and the other thing I think
[01:27.520 --> 01:33.600]  must be and think back to like, when you were doing your college newspaper, like, there is
[01:33.600 --> 01:41.200]  something you know, pressure, john, but like, if you say something dumb, and Phil Schiller says
[01:41.200 --> 01:45.360]  something, and you walk off stage at the end of the talk show live, and you're like, What did I
[01:45.360 --> 01:51.760]  do? You got to live with it for a year. And Letterman or Colbert or Jimmy Kimmel or whoever,
[01:51.760 --> 01:55.200]  they have a bad show. Guess what? There's no show tomorrow. It's like a baseball player, right?
[01:55.200 --> 01:59.440]  There's like, there's so many games, you have a bad game, just there's another game tomorrow.
[01:59.440 --> 02:03.440]  Just and I think that there's some truth in that too, that it's all met. The whole year is
[02:03.440 --> 02:08.960]  magnified on that one show. No pressure. Forget what forget what I said. Now in a year. Yeah.
[02:10.480 --> 02:14.960]  Exactly. So I have that too. You know, I have I've had two podcast interviews with Apple employees
[02:14.960 --> 02:20.640]  set up by Apple PR in the last three months. And it's definitely like, on one level, I interview
[02:20.640 --> 02:24.800]  people all the time. And on another level, it's like, boy, like, they're taking a chance. I'm
[02:24.800 --> 02:30.160]  taking a chance. I better not screw this. No, it's true. It's true. And then you're kind of destroyed
[02:30.160 --> 02:34.880]  afterward, where it's just like, Oh, my God, I don't and hard to tell whether you did a good
[02:34.880 --> 02:39.360]  job or not, honestly, because if I think you and I are similar in this way, you're so self critical
[02:39.360 --> 02:43.120]  that you're always thinking like, I could have done this differently. Why did that go that way?
[02:43.120 --> 02:47.280]  I didn't expect this. And you completely lose perspective. So when people say it was a great
[02:47.280 --> 02:52.320]  show, you just have to say thank you. Because I don't know, could be. This was the first time
[02:52.960 --> 02:56.320]  and I forget how many years I've been doing it. There was the one with
[02:56.320 --> 03:01.680]  cable Sasser at 111 minute. Were you there for that one? Yeah, first ever live talk show that was
[03:02.640 --> 03:12.160]  and then and then I, I think I had the ATP guys on at mezzanine. Right. And then the third year
[03:12.160 --> 03:17.520]  was Schiller. And which is crazy to me, I think, right, unless I'm missing something that already
[03:17.520 --> 03:24.880]  by the third year of the live talk show was the famous I shit you not feel Schiller right
[03:24.880 --> 03:30.960]  introduction, which was amazing. Yeah, I think that's I think that's right. And then next year
[03:30.960 --> 03:39.600]  was Schiller and Federighi. I'm going to draw a blank here. Maybe it was Schiller and Federighi,
[03:39.600 --> 03:44.880]  three years. I don't know. I don't know. Didn't didn't you have like Jaws at one point in there?
[03:44.880 --> 03:51.200]  Jaws was last year Jaws and Mike Rockwell were last year. But Schiller and Federighi made a
[03:51.200 --> 03:57.280]  comeback together the first year at San Jose at the California Theatre. Yeah, that sounds right.
[03:57.280 --> 04:01.280]  Right. Yeah. Which is funny. Every time you mentioned the California Theatre, you mentioned
[04:01.280 --> 04:06.320]  those Apple events. And I remember those so well. The, the one the last one with Scott Forstall,
[04:06.320 --> 04:11.920]  where he was around, but not on stage because he was he was being fired in the process of being
[04:11.920 --> 04:18.080]  fired. I remember that I saw him. He was he was talking to Dr. Wave from Pixar out in the hallway.
[04:18.080 --> 04:23.680]  And literally the whole conversation as I walked by was, did you see Prometheus? Yes, it sucked.
[04:23.680 --> 04:28.800]  Yes. And then I was just like, Okay, that was a weird. And then it was gone after that, like,
[04:29.360 --> 04:34.880]  he's out of there. And the iPod photo was in that theater, too. I remember with you, too. Yeah. So
[04:34.880 --> 04:38.640]  that was that's a great venue. Like it was good enough for Steve Jobs. That's good enough for the
[04:38.640 --> 04:45.840]  talk show. It's amazing. And then I like the in the workup to the show. I'm like, why do I ever
[04:45.840 --> 04:49.440]  do this is the last year I'm ever doing this. I'm never doing this again. I don't care how popular
[04:49.440 --> 04:54.800]  this is. I don't care. I'm just gonna it's not worth it. Then I do the show, and it comes off
[04:54.800 --> 04:59.920]  okay. And I go backstage. And it seemed like I was like, this year, I really felt like, hey,
[04:59.920 --> 05:03.280]  that might have been the best one I ever did. I might have been the most comfortable. It might
[05:03.280 --> 05:08.000]  have been the funniest. And I'm like, Why don't I do this all the time? I should do I should come
[05:08.000 --> 05:14.000]  out here once a month to do one of these. Yeah, I think so. I mean, even even though it's only
[05:14.000 --> 05:19.040]  once a year, I do think that anything you repeat, you get better, ideally, and you have definitely
[05:19.040 --> 05:22.960]  gotten better. Not to say you were bad before, but I do think you're less visibly nervous.
[05:24.720 --> 05:28.880]  It feels that way. It absolutely feels that way. And I don't know, again, I think what you should
[05:28.880 --> 05:33.600]  do is, you know, do it like 52 times a year or something like that. And then you get really good.
[05:33.600 --> 05:38.080]  Doing it once a year probably isn't the best way to build up muscle memory. But yet somehow,
[05:38.640 --> 05:43.520]  it feels like I have. I do feel that way. Yeah, I know. I think there's some shorthand there where
[05:43.520 --> 05:47.360]  you're realizing like, Oh, I already you know, you process it and like, this is how I do this
[05:47.360 --> 05:50.400]  part of it. And then you just put that to the side and it lets you focus on the rest and get
[05:50.400 --> 05:54.800]  a little bit better. I had a I had an email the other week from somebody who said, I love these
[05:54.800 --> 05:58.400]  people. They're the best. These are all like the disciples of John Syracuse. So they're like,
[05:58.400 --> 06:04.720]  Hey, I finally found the incomparable. And so I started listening from the first episode. Like,
[06:04.720 --> 06:10.480]  what are you doing? There's 460 plus episodes of this show. It's been on since 2010. What are
[06:10.480 --> 06:17.520]  you doing? 1000 hours, 1000 hours of audio. But what the email said was, was and I've listened
[06:17.520 --> 06:22.480]  to the whole thing. Okay, amazing. You've gotten a lot better as a host since 2010. And my response
[06:22.480 --> 06:26.560]  was thank you. I can't believe you listened to all those episodes. That really wasn't necessary. And
[06:26.560 --> 06:31.360]  I would hope that after 1000 hours of hosting a podcast, I would at least get a little bit better.
[06:31.360 --> 06:35.040]  Right? You would like there's something really wrong. You should give up if you're not
[06:35.040 --> 06:39.840]  appreciably better at anything. After you've been doing it every week for 10 years, right? Like
[06:39.840 --> 06:46.080]  that's we as human beings, we should get better at things as we do them. I you we would hope so.
[06:48.400 --> 06:53.040]  Doesn't always happen. But yeah, try something else. Maybe we we tweaked a few things and my
[06:53.040 --> 06:57.760]  live show this year. I don't know what was obvious. I mean, you've been to them, right?
[06:57.760 --> 07:05.920]  I've been all of them. Okay. So we tweaked a couple of things this year, which in the theater,
[07:05.920 --> 07:12.960]  and the big one was we moved forward on the stage. So at the California theater, it this,
[07:12.960 --> 07:17.600]  I don't know how much shows up on video. It's like when you're there, you can see it and it's very
[07:17.600 --> 07:23.920]  palpable is that they have what they call an orchestra area, right at the front of the stage,
[07:23.920 --> 07:29.520]  and they can raise and lower that part of the stage. And in years past, we've kept it lower
[07:31.520 --> 07:37.040]  and done our staging on the main stage behind that. And then this year,
[07:39.280 --> 07:44.560]  it wasn't a conflict it but it was just a little bit of a back and forth negotiation. The day after
[07:44.560 --> 07:51.680]  my show, the San Francisco 49ers were holding something there. I don't know if that how if like
[07:51.680 --> 07:56.960]  people saw like 49ers in the area Wednesday or not, but but they were holding a big event there.
[07:56.960 --> 08:01.680]  I don't even know what it was. Yeah, it's some I think involving their spring practices. And I
[08:01.680 --> 08:04.960]  don't know whether it was a team thing or a charity thing. But there was like they were
[08:04.960 --> 08:09.280]  they were around. It was like when they fly the players in a couple months before their training
[08:09.280 --> 08:18.720]  camp. So yeah, they were around. So they, there was some talk, like two months before my show
[08:18.720 --> 08:24.560]  of Hey, the 49ers or at first they just said a client, there's another client who has an event
[08:24.560 --> 08:32.800]  the day after you. And they would like to do some setup the day before your day. You know,
[08:33.600 --> 08:38.640]  how long you know, what hours do you need the theater? What can they do? And maybe you might
[08:38.640 --> 08:43.840]  have to keep the curtains closed, etc, etc. And I was just like, at first, I was like, f you,
[08:43.840 --> 08:48.640]  you know, I mean, like, I'm, I'm paying rack rate for this theater for the day. I'm going to do
[08:48.640 --> 08:52.880]  whatever I want. But then I, you know, I, you know, I listened and I had an open mind. And I
[08:52.880 --> 08:59.520]  thought, Hey, wait a minute. If we close the curtains and move forward, wouldn't that be a
[08:59.520 --> 09:03.680]  little bit more intimate? Wouldn't that? Why haven't we done this for ever since we've been
[09:03.680 --> 09:09.760]  there? And then like, I started looking at like, like, when stand up comedians play there, and I'm
[09:09.760 --> 09:15.600]  not saying that my show is a stand up comedy show, but it's closer, you know, in terms of what type
[09:15.600 --> 09:22.080]  of event it is, it's people with microphones trying to be entertaining and informative.
[09:22.720 --> 09:26.480]  Right. You know, with an intimacy with the crowd is like, why aren't we closer? And they were like,
[09:26.480 --> 09:30.000]  Oh, yeah, every time a stand up comedian plays here, they raise the orchestra and play at the
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.240]  front of the stage. And I'm like, Why haven't I been doing that for two years? I think this
[09:34.240 --> 09:39.040]  actually isn't even like a concession to the people, you know, the 49ers having the event the
[09:39.040 --> 09:43.200]  day after this actually seems like a better way to stage this, we should be closer. And then the
[09:43.200 --> 09:49.520]  other change we made is we kept the house lights up a little bit higher this year. In years past,
[09:49.520 --> 09:54.400]  our perspective, me and my guests on the stage is pretty much the audience is just black,
[09:54.400 --> 10:00.720]  just a complete blackout. And so we raised the lights sound. No, we raised, we raised the lights
[10:00.720 --> 10:04.160]  a little bit this year. And I don't know what you thought from the audience. But from the stage,
[10:04.160 --> 10:09.520]  it made a huge difference. But I specifically remember seeing you I, there was like a hand,
[10:09.520 --> 10:13.760]  it was maybe the only thing that almost threw me off was that I was like, Hey, there's John
[10:13.760 --> 10:21.600]  Sirkusa taking pictures in the front row. Almost like, every time I'd see like a friend, I had,
[10:21.600 --> 10:26.880]  and I, you know, had all these tickets in reserve for friends to put them in the front rows. And,
[10:26.880 --> 10:31.760]  and it was like, at least three times in the opening five minutes, I would be like,
[10:31.760 --> 10:36.880]  Hey, there's my pal, Jason, that I should interrupt my interrupt this opening monologue
[10:36.880 --> 10:40.560]  and say hi to him. Go shake some hands work the crowd. But yeah, yeah, that's what the monologue
[10:40.560 --> 10:45.760]  is for. Like, Hey, I see you over there. Yeah, I think it was fine. I you know, I think you don't
[10:45.760 --> 10:49.840]  want the lights too, too high out there. Because you feel almost like you're you're part of the
[10:49.840 --> 10:55.120]  show. And you kind of overexposed a little bit. But but you know, what you did, that's a movie
[10:55.120 --> 10:58.880]  theater scenario. So it doesn't need to be complete darkness except for the stage. And
[10:59.440 --> 11:04.080]  it's funny, I was thinking about this because I went to the ATP and relay shows too. And I was
[11:04.080 --> 11:07.920]  briefly on stage for the relay show, which those are the hammer theater, which is on the San Jose
[11:07.920 --> 11:12.080]  State campus. It's a couple blocks away. It's good, great, great little venue. That was the
[11:12.080 --> 11:17.760]  venue that the that they use for the app documentary two years ago. Right? And now it's
[11:17.760 --> 11:22.880]  now it's it's like podcasts all week long. Yeah, well, like Marco and Casey and john went to the
[11:22.880 --> 11:26.720]  relay thing last week, and they said, or last year, and they said, Oh, this is good. We should
[11:26.720 --> 11:30.800]  do this because they were in the ballroom at alt conf, where they're like, everybody's on the same
[11:30.800 --> 11:34.320]  level. And they've got a stage that's like six inches off the ground. And it's a better venue.
[11:34.320 --> 11:38.160]  But so standing in the wings, I'm literally waiting to go on and do my little cameo.
[11:39.680 --> 11:44.720]  I looked backstage where there's some there's some like, audio equipment and stuff like that,
[11:44.720 --> 11:49.520]  and a little video equipment that wasn't being used. And, and I had that moment where I looked
[11:49.520 --> 11:53.120]  and I was like, Oh, my God, there's an enormous theater stage back here, because of course there
[11:53.120 --> 12:00.320]  was. But, you know, the used part was this very small front of the stage. And I think it makes it
[12:00.320 --> 12:06.320]  Yeah, same reason. It's more intimate. You don't have, you know, somebody on a horse riding by or
[12:06.320 --> 12:10.640]  something like nothing like that is happening. It's just, it's just people talking into microphones.
[12:10.640 --> 12:15.040]  So So get to the front of the stage. And, and I think it I think it works. I think it's great.
[12:15.040 --> 12:18.880]  It is amazing. There was a Did you see that article? There was an article in a German
[12:18.880 --> 12:24.000]  newspaper that literally the whole article was basically like, it was like a five page long
[12:24.000 --> 12:29.600]  article on their website. It's a long article. It was basically, can you believe that people
[12:29.600 --> 12:36.800]  want to listen to basically dudes with microphones talking about computers on stage?
[12:36.800 --> 12:40.960]  I thought I thought it was a great article. I really enjoyed it. I really did. And I wish
[12:40.960 --> 12:50.080]  it it made me God, I wish I could speak and read 10 different languages. I'm so inept at
[12:51.760 --> 12:55.600]  multiple languages. I took four years of Spanish in high school and all I can do is order
[12:55.600 --> 13:08.240]  amber amber gay so's and survey so's de Puerto era bano may I go to the bathroom? I know I don't
[13:08.240 --> 13:13.760]  even know how to ask where the bathroom is. Don't they stop el bano I guess is where's the bathroom?
[13:13.760 --> 13:17.520]  So I took German in high school and college and yeah, it's good. It's a good article. But it is
[13:17.520 --> 13:23.920]  funny that the premise right stepping outside our bubble for a moment the premise is Did you know
[13:23.920 --> 13:29.200]  that that there are all these podcasts about apple it's like and it is weird right to think
[13:29.200 --> 13:34.400]  that people are going into big theaters to sit and watch a podcast which is fundamentally not
[13:34.400 --> 13:41.200]  a visual medium live on stage all week but we do yeah and you know and I thought I thought it was
[13:41.200 --> 13:45.600]  a fascinating article and I really you know I don't know what nuance I missed by reading it
[13:45.600 --> 13:51.120]  through google translate although I'm blown away by how good google translate has gotten it's truly
[13:51.120 --> 13:59.440]  truly one of the technical marvels of the world it really is and I probably get a rep as somebody
[13:59.440 --> 14:07.600]  who's anti google on the whole and the you know tech world I have to say I've always thought
[14:07.600 --> 14:13.360]  google web search is truly a just a marvel of the world like seriously like if if like
[14:13.360 --> 14:17.920]  Thomas Jefferson or Ben Franklin time traveled to today what would you show them how would you
[14:17.920 --> 14:22.480]  ease them into the modern world would know I mean wouldn't google search be one of the first things
[14:22.480 --> 14:27.280]  you show them you know just open up a computer or an ipad you know probably an ipad really if you
[14:27.280 --> 14:32.640]  really want to wow them single window one field show them how you can search for stuff google
[14:32.640 --> 14:38.960]  translate is absolutely astounding it it's truly amazing it's it I feel like in the next five or
[14:38.960 --> 14:42.400]  ten years we're going to get to the point where you could literally read anything from anywhere
[14:42.400 --> 14:48.400]  in any language in your native language and it will be I mean already it's readable but I think
[14:48.400 --> 14:52.000]  there's only a matter of time you would think before it's they've used machine learning to
[14:52.000 --> 14:58.000]  scour every word every sentence every construction in English ever and in German ever and we'll be
[14:58.000 --> 15:04.720]  able to just basically be it maybe never as artful as a human translator but like for web articles
[15:04.720 --> 15:09.040]  nobody else is going to translate them and if they're completely readable that's miraculous
[15:09.040 --> 15:15.120]  right that's amazing the article on on these live podcasts and it started with the sort of a you are
[15:15.120 --> 15:21.440]  there you're in the line for my show but you know he talked about all the other live shows that
[15:21.440 --> 15:25.920]  happened during a week at wdc but it was funny because there was like a little if you want to
[15:25.920 --> 15:34.160]  call it a translato you know a translation typo yeah it was like the snake the snakes the snake
[15:34.160 --> 15:41.040]  wines around the block and what he meant was I I guess I guess it somehow my my interpretation of
[15:41.040 --> 15:47.440]  how this got misinterpreted was that in German it said something like the queue snakes around the
[15:47.440 --> 15:56.160]  block I get yeah and some somehow though the line for my show turned into a steak and Paul Kefas
[15:57.040 --> 16:01.920]  announcer of the show and and my wife we all got we're on a group chat when the article came out
[16:01.920 --> 16:08.160]  we all agreed that from now on any sort of cues is a snake is a snake yeah it's it's literally
[16:08.160 --> 16:14.320]  German German uses a word for snake to mean q so instead or line so instead of a line winding
[16:14.320 --> 16:19.520]  around they say it's a a snake is a line as a snake so it and that's one of those things
[16:19.520 --> 16:28.720]  that's interesting where google translate didn't get like it should be like your it's probably not
[16:28.720 --> 16:35.200]  a literally a snake winding around it's probably a line but it didn't do that but it was a great
[16:35.200 --> 16:39.520]  article it was and I think it's interesting because I do think there's something true to
[16:39.520 --> 16:46.480]  that and the gist of the article in the bigger term was that apple listens to podcasts popular
[16:46.480 --> 16:52.560]  apple podcasts and you know they don't respond on a weekly basis but they they clearly do listen
[16:52.560 --> 17:04.000]  uh and I thought it was extraordinary and and so delightful how much access the the apple podcast
[17:04.000 --> 17:14.480]  sphere got during WWDC I mean just off the top of my head uh Federico interviewed um uh Craig
[17:14.480 --> 17:22.480]  Federico on Tuesday you had uh an interview with Wiley Hodges and Josh and I always forget Josh
[17:22.480 --> 17:27.840]  is it's Shaffer because it's spelled like Paul Shaffer but it's not pronounced right that's see
[17:27.840 --> 17:35.040]  I get mixed up but Wiley Hodges and Josh Shaffer which I I just want to just full stop interrupt
[17:35.040 --> 17:41.200]  my show and say that upgrade episode I think it's 249 because one of the things I wanted to talk
[17:41.200 --> 17:47.200]  about is that you guys you guys are going to lap me on on episode numbers very shortly because this
[17:47.200 --> 17:54.640]  is you and I are talking right now in the midst of episode 255 good number of my show yeah we're
[17:54.640 --> 18:07.280]  almost we're almost at a buffer overflow uh absolutely the best layperson overview of Swift
[18:07.280 --> 18:15.760]  UI written audio otherwise of any anything I've seen since WWDC episode 240 the whole episode
[18:15.760 --> 18:20.160]  people should listen to nobody should skip around but if you were going to skip around I would skip
[18:20.160 --> 18:25.840]  around to the part where Jason interviews uh Wiley Hodges who's a product manager in the dev tools
[18:25.840 --> 18:34.800]  team and uh Josh Shaffer who you know wants his baby yeah won't say you know nobody takes credit
[18:34.800 --> 18:40.320]  for it they're an apple it's apple's thing but effectively Swift UI is his thing and it is
[18:40.320 --> 18:48.640]  absolutely phenomenal overview and and answers so many questions every single question I had
[18:48.640 --> 18:54.480]  even questions that I didn't think to ask while I was with these guys in WWDC in San Jose I was like
[18:54.480 --> 18:58.880]  oh I hope Jason asks by and every single one that popped into my head you would ask within 30
[18:58.880 --> 19:03.360]  seconds of me thinking of it during this podcast it's one of the best interviews I've seen not a
[19:03.360 --> 19:08.800]  wasted question such a great overview uh I appreciate that because I came out of it feeling
[19:08.800 --> 19:13.120]  sort of the way that I described earlier which is was that good or was that a disaster I don't know
[19:13.120 --> 19:18.640]  and then because those guys what's what's funny is like Craig Federighi by the way he's kind of
[19:18.640 --> 19:24.480]  a unicorn because he is a deeply technical guy but he also like totally gets and and you know
[19:24.480 --> 19:29.040]  Schiller is like this but Schiller's not like a super technical guy he's a he is a marketing guy
[19:29.040 --> 19:35.840]  but Craig is is like you always feel it when he's walking around at WWDC he's one of us one you know
[19:35.840 --> 19:41.680]  he is a he is a computer nerd he is a developer he's got cred in that area but he also has really
[19:42.400 --> 19:48.400]  blossomed as a spokesperson and he straddles that line in a way that is I call him a unicorn because
[19:48.400 --> 19:53.680]  it's hard to find people who can communicate as somebody who is a tech magazine editor so
[19:53.680 --> 19:57.760]  hard to find people who know the technical stuff and can communicate it well and Craig does it
[19:57.760 --> 20:04.720]  amazingly well and these guys are lower down in terms of like the details of this tech stuff
[20:04.720 --> 20:10.560]  but they also don't get out to communicate to the public a lot and so that was the challenge is like
[20:11.200 --> 20:15.440]  like I was telling you earlier before we started there were a couple moments where I'd ask a
[20:15.440 --> 20:21.200]  question and they'd look at each other and I'm like uh-oh what did I what did I do because and
[20:21.200 --> 20:26.400]  I think it wasn't a problem with my question it was that they don't have the internal map maybe
[20:26.400 --> 20:32.640]  as right as much at hand as Craig does about what what how you answer a question what you say what
[20:32.640 --> 20:37.520]  you what you're allowed to say that won't get you in trouble and they were like like thinking about
[20:37.520 --> 20:41.360]  it a little bit and that's what I really noticed about it versus your interview with Craig where
[20:41.360 --> 20:45.920]  Craig is just like I mean he's super smooth and also he's got somebody next to him who's in
[20:45.920 --> 20:50.160]  marketing who can pull the chain if he says something he shouldn't he was on fire on my
[20:50.160 --> 20:56.960]  show he really was he was just absolutely on fire um you're right you're right and and I part of it
[20:56.960 --> 21:02.640]  with Phil Schiller is not I don't think it's so much that Phil Schiller can't speak to the technical
[21:02.640 --> 21:09.280]  details he he almost certainly doesn't understand the software to a deep technical level like
[21:09.280 --> 21:12.880]  Federighi does just because it's Federighi's job he's literally the head of software
[21:13.440 --> 21:21.520]  but I think I I think overall though Schiller there even when he's being relaxed and he's in
[21:21.520 --> 21:25.920]  a hey I'm gonna do this podcast you know like he was on ATP a couple months ago
[21:25.920 --> 21:32.320]  he'll he still doesn't want to break that seal there's there's he's so old school apple that
[21:32.320 --> 21:38.160]  he really doesn't want to break the seal on how the magic is done you know yep yeah it's it's true
[21:38.160 --> 21:43.440]  and that this is something you know we witness when we talk to these these guys and um and I
[21:43.440 --> 21:47.040]  should mention I said guys there I should mention that one of the people that I got to talk to
[21:47.040 --> 21:54.080]  this year for upgrade was Colleen Novielli who ended up on stage at WWDC and I definitely got
[21:54.080 --> 21:59.840]  the sense like that that this was one of the that our interview was kind of like getting her her
[21:59.840 --> 22:04.720]  feet wet in being doing public communication and that and then she's on stage and I'm like oh and
[22:04.720 --> 22:09.200]  it was funny because a lot of people are like hey we know her and it's because her voice was on a
[22:09.200 --> 22:14.720]  podcast and I think that apple that's why we had so many podcast interviews at dub dub this year
[22:14.720 --> 22:20.000]  is because um they tried it out with Renee Ritchie and then they tried it out with with me and
[22:20.000 --> 22:24.880]  they've been doing these on stage interviews too with you and I think they finally were like this
[22:24.880 --> 22:31.760]  is great let's just go all in and so there were like a dozen different podcast interviews uh and
[22:31.760 --> 22:38.960]  and that was great to see too yeah so Colleen was the woman who introduced the pro display
[22:38.960 --> 22:45.680]  xdr on stage she was the one who clicked that button to get past the 999 stand as quickly as
[22:45.680 --> 22:54.560]  possible uh but she's also you know if you're a close uh attention pair you would know that she's
[22:54.560 --> 23:02.160]  also the product manager for is it the iMac pro or the iMac iMac as a whole iMac and iMac pro
[23:04.880 --> 23:11.280]  and absolutely knocked it out of the park kind of you know we we can get into this I think on the
[23:11.280 --> 23:18.080]  like the price of the pro display xdr kind of had a tough that's a tough thing to pitch because
[23:18.080 --> 23:24.160]  you've got this amazing amazing product and it's sort of a shit sandwich when it comes down to how
[23:24.160 --> 23:29.280]  much it costs etc and your audience for that product is not in the room right like the
[23:29.280 --> 23:35.520]  developers primed for a monitor that developers would want if she was at one at NAB or something
[23:35.520 --> 23:39.040]  doing that people would have stormed the stage right people they would have been
[23:39.040 --> 23:43.440]  falling down faint in the aisles yeah they would have run down the aisles and lifted her up on her
[23:43.440 --> 23:48.480]  shoulders like Vince Lombardi after the Super Bowl too and taking her off the stage right yeah
[23:48.480 --> 23:52.000]  absolutely because they and they and they would have been and it would have been because the price
[23:52.000 --> 23:56.320]  was so low they'd be like oh my god I might get one of these on my desk yeah it's a $30,000
[23:56.320 --> 24:00.720]  monitor for $6,000 this is amazing whereas everybody else is like you're charging what huh
[24:00.720 --> 24:06.800]  so we can hold that thought but that was amazing and she was great and then she also did
[24:06.800 --> 24:14.000]  the there were a lot of behind the scenes briefings off-the-record briefings for members
[24:14.000 --> 24:21.680]  of the media yeah in I again this sounds like looking a gift horse in the mouth to say that
[24:21.680 --> 24:28.080]  there were too many but I had too many yeah and again this I'd rather have too many than not
[24:28.080 --> 24:35.040]  enough it is an absolute privilege this when I got into this racket you know 20 years ago or
[24:35.040 --> 24:39.360]  started thinking about it you know this is where I wanted to be and Mike this is where you want to
[24:39.360 --> 24:46.160]  be if you cover Apple as as a career you would like to be in the circle where when WWDC Apple
[24:46.160 --> 24:51.200]  has behind the scenes off-the-record press briefings you'd like to be invited to them
[24:51.200 --> 24:56.400]  yep I'm there and it's happened I was happy to be there but boy there were a lot but part
[24:56.400 --> 25:02.640]  and I don't blame them you know it and and it was not like it was absolutely not like a shotgun
[25:02.640 --> 25:08.560]  a shotgun approach like here's all this stuff and you know you figure it out it was it was simply
[25:08.560 --> 25:14.080]  because they had so much to announce this year I think in hindsight now that WWDC has settled in
[25:14.640 --> 25:20.000]  are everybody's immediate impression that holy crap they did a lot this year and announced a
[25:20.000 --> 25:27.440]  lot this year was exactly spot on and it wasn't just our excitement over the first day or two
[25:27.440 --> 25:34.720]  and and sort of you know every year it seems like a lot but it just seemed like this year it it
[25:34.720 --> 25:39.920]  truly was more than usual there really was a lot that they couldn't fit in the keynote I feel like
[25:39.920 --> 25:44.160]  it was and and you know what they do of course because they ask you'd like to ask me whenever
[25:44.160 --> 25:47.040]  you see an Apple person afterward in one of those briefings they say what did you think of the
[25:47.040 --> 25:51.280]  keynote and you're like oh man now you're asking me to review your thing that you just did and and
[25:51.280 --> 25:56.800]  what I said this time was I think that might be the most dense Apple presentation keynote
[25:56.800 --> 26:01.840]  presentation I've ever seen yep just content dense there there have been more earth-shattering things
[26:01.840 --> 26:06.400]  like the iPhone launch I mean there's lots of those but but in terms of just content density
[26:06.400 --> 26:13.200]  like we we have spent the last two years ish year and a half how long ago was Gurman's first
[26:13.200 --> 26:18.320]  marzipan report talking about the implications of marzipan at least a year and a half ago yeah
[26:19.360 --> 26:25.120]  the implications of marzipan for mac os and did they give it even five minutes on stage and
[26:25.120 --> 26:28.720]  they're off to the next thing it was like I had that moment I'm like whoa wait a second
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.760]  that was marzipan and it's gone the catalyst is just like here it is and we can't wait to see
[26:35.760 --> 26:40.880]  what you do with it on to the next thing we're going to do swift ui now and and that was that
[26:40.880 --> 26:46.240]  that thing it was just super dense and that's why we all had like I don't know how it worked for you
[26:46.240 --> 26:50.160]  there's a little inside baseball but I got a little uh email from an apple pr person saying
[26:50.160 --> 26:54.080]  well here's what we've got you doing and there were like eight things on it and there's like
[26:54.080 --> 26:57.760]  a briefing and a demo and another briefing and another demo didn't even say what the briefings
[26:57.760 --> 27:02.320]  are because of course they're secret and I just thought what you know like well they're they're
[27:02.320 --> 27:08.160]  filling my schedule it's like I'm I'm at a conference or something where that's not wwc
[27:08.160 --> 27:13.360]  I'm like at the apple conference that they are slotting me in all these slots but but they it's
[27:13.360 --> 27:17.280]  not like they didn't have stuff to talk about to all of us there was they were really deconstructing
[27:17.280 --> 27:24.560]  those two hours for the rest of the week did you get the uh privacy briefing I don't know if I got
[27:24.560 --> 27:29.200]  that one yeah I don't know if I got that one I feel like that one might have been a shorter I
[27:29.200 --> 27:33.200]  don't know why it just seems like a lot of the people I talked to didn't get it but there was
[27:33.200 --> 27:40.400]  so much privacy and security stuff that and in theory all of it everything they told me could
[27:40.400 --> 27:48.160]  have been in the keynote because it's it's all useful it's all uh very pertinent to the daily
[27:48.160 --> 27:54.560]  life of people using these platforms and it's of course strongly aligned with apple's recent
[27:55.360 --> 28:04.320]  public push to emphasize their privacy and security angle and yet none of it made the
[28:04.320 --> 28:09.440]  keynote yeah it was insane yeah there's a little in state of the union and then there there were
[28:09.440 --> 28:14.400]  a bunch of sessions I went to like because the depth of like even in mac os you know we focus
[28:14.400 --> 28:18.560]  on ios so much but like even in mac os there are so many security and privacy things that they've
[28:18.560 --> 28:25.360]  done um to lock down certain things but also allow apps to open up other things and like it's it's
[28:25.920 --> 28:30.000]  it's very clear that at some point and I would love to know the backstory on this at some point
[28:30.640 --> 28:35.520]  the directive came down from the top that that said we're going to impose some discipline on
[28:35.520 --> 28:42.320]  product design and also product communication where everything has a security and privacy
[28:42.320 --> 28:48.720]  story like you can't have a feature or a product at apple you can't present it on stage you can't
[28:48.720 --> 28:55.280]  formulate it without telling the story of how this is secure and how this makes sure that your
[28:55.280 --> 29:00.000]  information stays private and the discipline has been very impressive like in the last two years
[29:00.000 --> 29:05.920]  not a thing gets announced without security and privacy being mentioned yeah I totally agree um
[29:08.240 --> 29:16.000]  it's it it's very impressive to me that how much stuff they had to announce it's just crazy I I
[29:16.000 --> 29:20.400]  I know it's closer to the end of the month than the beginning of the month and I still feel like
[29:20.400 --> 29:26.160]  I'm not done processing everything yeah I came out of it in like a haze for I mean I was watching
[29:26.160 --> 29:30.320]  videos after the week was over to catch up on the sessions that I missed because I was in briefings
[29:30.320 --> 29:35.520]  instead of in sessions you know because you can only be in one place and it is even now like
[29:35.520 --> 29:38.960]  somebody pops up with something they're like oh did you see that this thing got announced
[29:39.600 --> 29:45.200]  you know in this session and like no I had no idea and and and that you know it's it's it's
[29:45.200 --> 29:51.520]  amazing how much they held back and I think I think the truth is one of the reasons it's like
[29:51.520 --> 29:58.720]  this is because a lot of stuff has been on the boil for years in the background and then this
[29:58.720 --> 30:02.960]  is the year where they just released so much of it openly so this is not like here's what we've
[30:02.960 --> 30:07.440]  been working on the last year this is like some of this stuff we have been working on for five years
[30:07.440 --> 30:12.720]  and now you get to see it yeah I I sort of have that feeling too that it's not necessarily
[30:12.720 --> 30:19.600]  indicative that every every June is going to be this much of a bonanza of news I think there's
[30:19.600 --> 30:25.040]  a little bit of that where I do feel like institutionally they've gotten better at
[30:26.400 --> 30:32.880]  as we've all said for a long time probably ever since the iPhone came out that they're getting
[30:32.880 --> 30:37.440]  better at walking and chewing gum at the same time doing two things ever since that first iPhone came
[30:37.440 --> 30:42.400]  out and they had to announce that the major Mac OS version was going to be postponed six months
[30:42.400 --> 30:52.560]  because they had to pull engineers to finish iOS 1.0 there's always been a sort of I don't even
[30:52.560 --> 30:57.600]  think it's unfair I think it's a little unfair in so far as we don't know the backstory because
[30:57.600 --> 31:05.600]  they're so secretive but from the outside it's kind of fair to say that Apple has really only
[31:05.600 --> 31:10.080]  been good at doing one thing at a time no matter how big the company's gotten how wealthy they've
[31:10.080 --> 31:18.000]  gotten their profits they've you know had trouble over the last 12 years keeping all of the platforms
[31:18.000 --> 31:23.760]  moving together year after year as opposed to just moving the iPhone OS forward I mean who has
[31:23.760 --> 31:29.440]  succeeded at maintaining two user soft separate user software platforms at all like Microsoft
[31:29.440 --> 31:35.520]  didn't do it yeah and I think you look you can use that lens to look at catalyst and swift UI
[31:35.520 --> 31:39.760]  and all the stuff that they they only talked about briefly last year but like under the hood they've
[31:39.760 --> 31:44.080]  been trying to correct for all the drift that's happened over the last decade between because it
[31:44.080 --> 31:48.960]  was iOS was based on Mac OS but it's drifted and now you want to bring the app platform back
[31:48.960 --> 31:53.760]  together you got to kind of have all the pieces be the same version and react the same way and
[31:53.760 --> 31:58.800]  they've you know a lot of this is about Apple saying we can't maintain these two completely
[31:58.800 --> 32:04.560]  separate platforms we just can't do it so yeah and I so it's almost like it's unfair to say they
[32:04.560 --> 32:09.440]  should have been doing better but I do I feel like maybe they are this was the year to me where they
[32:09.440 --> 32:15.520]  really showed that they could move everything forward in an interesting way and I think swift
[32:15.520 --> 32:22.400]  UI is a big part of that because it's it was conceived apparently originally for the watch
[32:22.400 --> 32:29.040]  but then it they were like this would work everywhere and right now this summer with
[32:29.040 --> 32:38.080]  the developer betas you can use swift UI on every single shipping Apple platform TV watch iPhone iPad
[32:38.080 --> 32:45.440]  Mac that's amazing and it's very different from the way stuff has rolled out in previous years
[32:45.440 --> 32:50.640]  where usually you know whatever platform it was meant for first would ship first and then other
[32:50.640 --> 32:57.120]  things would come a year later maybe two years later swift UI debuting on all the platforms
[32:57.120 --> 33:04.720]  right from the get-go is is a huge deal and and beyond swift UI itself which I think is
[33:04.720 --> 33:10.880]  really interesting really appley technology I think the fact that it's shipping on all
[33:10.880 --> 33:17.040]  their platforms at first is one of the biggest stories of of the month it also prevents
[33:18.720 --> 33:25.520]  kind of a platform I don't know what like a not invented here effect that you would get otherwise
[33:25.520 --> 33:30.400]  like if this was if this was and I'm not saying this is right I'm just saying this is what would
[33:30.400 --> 33:34.000]  happen if they came out and said here's a great new way to write watch apps and then a year later
[33:34.000 --> 33:39.280]  they said it turns out you can write Mac apps with this too I think or or iPad apps Mac and iPad
[33:39.280 --> 33:43.280]  people will be like what you want us to have watch apps now why are you doing this to our platform
[33:43.280 --> 33:48.000]  instead they're like no no no it's for everybody from the get-go and like it defuses a lot of
[33:48.000 --> 33:54.960]  arguments about like was this originally supposed to be for my platform and now you're or for that
[33:54.960 --> 33:58.960]  platform you're importing into mine it's just like no it's for everybody from the beginning
[33:58.960 --> 34:03.280]  and those arguments just don't happen and I think that's and you can all mix and match which is
[34:03.280 --> 34:07.440]  something that I talked about with Josh and Wiley right that that this is not one of those things
[34:07.440 --> 34:11.680]  where it's like well if you want to build a new app you can build it in this but your old app
[34:11.680 --> 34:18.240]  too bad it's like no you could literally you can build a Mac app for Catalina that is using Swift
[34:18.240 --> 34:26.080]  UI and Interface Builder that's written in Objective-C that's written in Swift that uses
[34:26.080 --> 34:33.680]  uses UIKit as well as AppKit you could literally put all these different technologies some stuff
[34:33.680 --> 34:39.280]  from iOS some stuff from Mac the new stuff in a single Mac app and it'll just work like that's
[34:39.280 --> 34:43.360]  the kind of amazing thing here is they're not making you choose you can actually mix and match
[34:43.360 --> 34:51.200]  this stuff if you want to as a developer there's there's you know the more things change the more
[34:51.200 --> 34:59.040]  they stay the same as as the saying goes it it's different but in some ways it is philosophically
[34:59.040 --> 35:06.320]  exactly the mentality that Apple has had ever since the next acquisition and or as I call it
[35:06.320 --> 35:16.800]  like to call it the reunification it you know this this this way and you emphasized it on upgrade I
[35:16.800 --> 35:23.520]  think when you were talking with Wiley and Josh like BB Edit as an example of an app that has
[35:23.520 --> 35:33.120]  been in active development since I think like 1991 1990 1991 at least publicly 1992 was when
[35:33.120 --> 35:41.520]  Rich released it and it's never really had a okay throw everything out we have to do it all over
[35:41.520 --> 35:47.520]  from scratch it has always been okay let's rewrite this part let's write rewrite this part let's
[35:47.520 --> 35:56.640]  rewrite let's redo you know these dialogue boxes to make them use the modern UI to cut you know so
[35:56.640 --> 36:03.280]  we can keep going and now all of a sudden here we are in 2019 and the app is 64-bit it's a 64-bit
[36:03.280 --> 36:13.680]  cocoa app that never once got rewritten from being a 32-bit pre-carbon classic mac os app in 1992
[36:15.280 --> 36:20.160]  and I'm in my mac world piece last week where I referenced your classic like 2010 talk about
[36:20.160 --> 36:25.840]  10 years ago piece I call it the app of Theseus where it's like literally like you replace every
[36:25.840 --> 36:29.600]  part of the ship as it's still the same ship right and like BB it's like that like Rich
[36:29.600 --> 36:36.000]  Siegel has replaced every part of that app but he'd ever had a schism I feel where it just oh
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.480]  old BB Edit is gone and here's new BB Edit he's just kept replacing the pieces and that so
[36:40.480 --> 36:44.880]  reflects on how Apple does this where they roll this stuff through and as you you said it's that
[36:44.880 --> 36:49.920]  constant iteration and you wrote about that in 2010 it was already clear that that's Apple's
[36:49.920 --> 36:54.960]  whole stock and trade is you make some leaps but really the the the key is that you then just
[36:54.960 --> 37:00.880]  keep pushing and keep iterating and you end up with these transitions that what my piece is
[37:00.880 --> 37:05.200]  about is like it's the invisible transition strategy it's like there's no Swift UI schism
[37:05.200 --> 37:08.240]  what's going to happen is we're going to sit around using our apps and in five years those
[37:08.240 --> 37:13.040]  apps are all going to be like written in Swift and built with Swift UI but we're not going to notice
[37:13.040 --> 37:16.080]  in a lot of cases because it's just going to happen in the background the developers will
[37:16.080 --> 37:21.200]  put in the work but for us it's just like I'm just using my Apple stuff and it works and that is how
[37:21.200 --> 37:26.400]  it should be yeah it's exactly right and you know so you can take an app like you said it's written
[37:26.400 --> 37:34.320]  in Objective-C has been around like on the iPhone for 10 years already and you have a new new new
[37:34.320 --> 37:40.640]  feature you want to add one new feature you could do just that feature that view in Swift UI and
[37:40.640 --> 37:49.120]  just introduce Swift UI into this 10 year old app for one view and that'll be fine and no and the
[37:49.120 --> 37:52.960]  user won't know it won't be like oh all of a sudden when I go into this feature everything
[37:52.960 --> 38:01.360]  looks different you know it's it's just a very Apple like way of introducing something that is
[38:01.360 --> 38:06.320]  truly truly significant if there's one thing and it's not a complaint because I don't know what
[38:06.320 --> 38:16.400]  else Apple could do is I do feel that the nature of their their public keynotes and the WWDC keynote
[38:16.400 --> 38:20.800]  it to me it's the most fun event of the year because you never know what you're going to get
[38:20.800 --> 38:26.640]  right like September probably September 7th or so I don't know what day of the week it is but you
[38:26.640 --> 38:31.280]  and I are probably going to be standing around outside the Steve Jobs theater on some Tuesday
[38:31.840 --> 38:35.760]  within you know nine days of the beginning of September yeah it'll be like the 10th of
[38:35.760 --> 38:40.320]  September this year is a Tuesday so probably let's say that I'll see you there yeah I'll probably
[38:40.320 --> 38:45.360]  yeah maybe I should book an air flight right now book my plane because that's probably it because
[38:45.360 --> 38:50.880]  they're not going to do it on the third because it's too close to Memorial Day and you we know
[38:50.880 --> 38:54.720]  what we're going to get we're going to get new iPhones and they're going to tell us you know
[38:54.720 --> 38:59.680]  whatever new features of iOS are optimized just for these new phones probably camera features and
[38:59.680 --> 39:04.240]  stuff like that I mean that's cool I always have a good time it's like I said I don't want to look
[39:04.240 --> 39:11.360]  at gift horse in the mouth it is I'm honored to be at this position in in this field to get invited
[39:11.360 --> 39:16.400]  to these things but WWDC is more exciting because you don't know what you're going to get right like
[39:16.400 --> 39:20.640]  we know that September event is going to be about iPhones and if there's an October event we'll
[39:20.640 --> 39:26.240]  probably have a good idea of what it's about just from weeks you know is it new MacBooks or
[39:26.240 --> 39:32.720]  something like that WWDC you just don't know and I this year to me was just like the canonical
[39:32.720 --> 39:39.600]  example of wow we got everything I mean you and Mike uh on upgrade do like the what do you call
[39:39.600 --> 39:44.560]  it bingo what do you guys have a draft it's a draft yeah the keynote draft where we take turns
[39:44.560 --> 39:49.360]  picking what's going to be set on stage but like everything hit this year oh yeah how does the
[39:49.360 --> 39:54.080]  score was nine to nine we had 10 picks each we you know it was nine to nine we had to go to a
[39:54.080 --> 40:00.400]  tiebreaker and even then arguably I mean it was almost 10 to nine but in the end we decided that
[40:00.400 --> 40:04.160]  one of Mike's didn't make it so yeah it was which makes it a lot less interesting when sort of like
[40:04.160 --> 40:10.240]  yeah we got all these things right but um that's the funny thing is that is that big picture is
[40:10.240 --> 40:15.120]  not the details and uh there were a lot of there are a lot of details missing this time that
[40:15.120 --> 40:20.560]  because it's software right they you get the big picture bark german is talking to people who have
[40:20.560 --> 40:26.240]  a little bit of an idea of what's going on and gee Rambo is you know digging through codes
[40:26.240 --> 40:31.680]  somewhere it's just code right it's just like framework compilations so it's what I always
[40:31.680 --> 40:36.560]  say is it's that parable of the blind men and the elephant which is like they're touching this
[40:36.560 --> 40:40.240]  giant animal and they can't tell what it is and one of them thinks it's a snake and one of them
[40:40.240 --> 40:44.320]  thinks it's a rhino and and uh it's like that where like we got the details but what's the
[40:44.320 --> 40:50.080]  story and that and with software there's no supply chain to leak and you end up with this
[40:50.080 --> 40:53.680]  you know it's much more kind of mysterious and something like like swift ui so you
[40:54.640 --> 40:58.640]  back in like a long time ago there was this whole question about like what was marzipan and what
[40:58.640 --> 41:02.640]  was swift ui and you went back and forth with german about it a little bit because german was
[41:02.640 --> 41:05.600]  like oh marzipan you said well that's not what i'm hearing i'm hearing it's this other thing and
[41:05.600 --> 41:13.120]  that was amber right right which turns out to be swift ui so we knew something about it but what
[41:13.120 --> 41:17.600]  we knew especially about swift ui was almost nothing other than that it existed and maybe
[41:17.600 --> 41:24.560]  we'd see it sometime that was it i knew a little bit more well i mean what i mean it's like the
[41:24.560 --> 41:29.680]  rest of us were on the outside looking at i was i was given this information over a year ago
[41:29.680 --> 41:35.120]  on the condition that i not share it widely and i agreed to that and i didn't share it
[41:35.120 --> 41:41.360]  widely and it wasn't me trying to be a weisenheimer i it was the conditions under which i was told
[41:41.360 --> 41:48.640]  about it um but the long story short is that swift ui is a is a much bigger project than
[41:48.640 --> 41:54.800]  marzipan catalyst and way more people are involved and if you just think about i mean the fact that
[41:54.800 --> 42:02.000]  it is the ui framework for all of these platforms and they've already i forget how many frameworks
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.480]  they said that already includes it's like 40 of the frameworks from ui kit and appkit are already
[42:06.480 --> 42:14.640]  in swift ui and the genius of this system is that for the ones that aren't in swift ui as native
[42:14.640 --> 42:20.480]  swift ui they just call down to the underlying platform you know frameworks that are already
[42:20.480 --> 42:25.920]  in ui kit and appkit so you you don't miss anything when you're writing an app in swift ui
[42:25.920 --> 42:32.080]  but a bunch of the stuff is already like it's not just a wrapper that calls down to ui kit and
[42:32.080 --> 42:41.200]  appkit it's it's really really a huge project it is truly i i what federighi said when he introduced
[42:41.200 --> 42:47.680]  it that is this is sort of a once every 20 years 25 year generational change i honestly don't think
[42:47.680 --> 42:53.120]  he oversold it at all i really think it's that big of a deal it is as big a deal as when apple
[42:53.120 --> 43:00.000]  first said the future of our of the mac is these next technologies the next frameworks cocoa for
[43:00.000 --> 43:08.480]  writing apps uh it's that big a deal it's like the introduction of cocoa in my opinion um it's
[43:08.480 --> 43:15.840]  it's hard not to imagine that in five or ten years like anything can happen but it seems that the
[43:15.840 --> 43:22.880]  plan is that most of the software written for apple's platforms in the 2020s you know as the
[43:22.880 --> 43:31.200]  2020s go on is going to be swift and uh swift ui like not everything maybe and certainly not at
[43:31.200 --> 43:39.040]  first but like this is their you know what what uh wiley said was uh what is it the future is great
[43:39.040 --> 43:44.880]  and also um secret or something like that he basically basically it's like the the struggle
[43:44.880 --> 43:48.560]  at apple is you never want to talk about the future but you also want to pump up this thing
[43:48.560 --> 43:52.000]  that you just announced and how important it is for the future right and that's the balance they
[43:52.000 --> 43:55.440]  have to strike but yeah i mean that's the impression i guess they didn't do this you know
[43:55.440 --> 44:01.520]  for a lark this is their this is the future that they think unifies all their app platforms in
[44:01.520 --> 44:06.560]  terms of the the what you need to know which is not the same as building one size fits all apps
[44:06.560 --> 44:11.440]  it's just in terms of what you need to know like when we talk about um app kit and ui kit and ios
[44:11.440 --> 44:16.800]  developers and mac developers the thing i keep trying to emphasize with people is you know it's
[44:16.800 --> 44:23.280]  not about even even uh catalyst is not necessarily about like creating a one-size-fits-all app apple
[44:23.280 --> 44:27.200]  went up there and said you look you check the box you're not done then you need to make a good ipad
[44:27.200 --> 44:32.880]  app then you need to make a good mac app the the issue with mac development for ios developers is
[44:32.880 --> 44:38.080]  they don't know how to do it because app kit is not ui kit they learn the other thing and with
[44:38.080 --> 44:43.280]  swift ui you learn the one thing and you know how to build stuff and swift you know how to build
[44:43.280 --> 44:47.120]  stuff on all of apple's platforms and that's better you still want to build building a watch
[44:47.120 --> 44:52.800]  app a good phone app a good mac app but you don't need to like learn a whole separate set of tools
[44:52.800 --> 44:57.600]  for each one and that's huge for developers and i'd imagine for everybody inside apple too
[44:58.240 --> 45:03.520]  who has to support these platforms all right hold that thought i i want to pick that up okay right
[45:03.520 --> 45:10.800]  after this message from our first sponsor away i love this company away makes suitcases uh and
[45:10.800 --> 45:18.160]  they've got two types now uh the original with durable german polycarbonate and now they have
[45:18.160 --> 45:24.320]  aluminum ones i don't have an aluminum one i've got uh the plastic one they call it polycarbonate
[45:24.320 --> 45:29.520]  but i again they've been sponsoring the show i think for like four years maybe even more i've
[45:29.520 --> 45:34.560]  they sent me one when they first sponsored the show i've taken it with me every single place
[45:34.560 --> 45:40.960]  i've gone for the last four years every airplane trip every train trip to new york every time i
[45:40.960 --> 45:46.720]  leave my house for more than a night i take this suitcase it still looks brand new and i it's not
[45:46.720 --> 45:53.280]  like i'm like babying it and the wheels super smooth like butter i i absolutely cannot believe
[45:53.280 --> 46:00.400]  how durable this suitcase is um and the carry-ons that they have they have all you know three sizes
[46:00.400 --> 46:06.080]  or actually four sizes two sizes of carry-ons like a regular carry-on a bigger carry-on the carry-ons
[46:06.080 --> 46:13.600]  all come with a tsa compliant ejectable battery and when i say it's ejectable it is so easy you
[46:13.600 --> 46:18.800]  just click it down it pops right out because you know the reason you want that is that if you have
[46:18.800 --> 46:22.720]  to check your bag you know like if you're if it's your carry-on you're hoping to put it over your
[46:22.720 --> 46:28.240]  head in the airplane but they say hey the overheads are full we're gonna have to uh check these things
[46:28.240 --> 46:32.320]  they tell you you can't have a battery in there you just pop it right out you keep it with you
[46:32.320 --> 46:37.040]  you know put it in your pocket or or put it in a seat uh little little folder there in front of
[46:37.040 --> 46:42.240]  your seat pops right out you don't need any tools anything like that couldn't be better but having
[46:42.240 --> 46:47.120]  a 5x like a thing that can charge your battery five times right there in your suitcase is
[46:47.120 --> 46:51.360]  amazing because every single seat you could take at the airport no matter where you go
[46:51.920 --> 46:55.600]  you've got a charger right there you don't have to look for like an outlet or something like that
[46:56.160 --> 47:03.040]  and i'm it there is no place in the world where you more need extra battery power than airport
[47:03.040 --> 47:07.440]  because every single airport i've ever been to just it's it's like you can just watch the battery
[47:07.440 --> 47:14.560]  on your phone just drain right down terrible love this uh feature of their suitcases uh everything
[47:14.560 --> 47:20.400]  else what else they've got uh tsa approved combination lock they've got uh a great inter
[47:20.400 --> 47:25.920]  inside the suitcases they have this patent-pending compression system all that means is that they're
[47:25.920 --> 47:30.320]  sort of compartments and then you can put your shirts on the one side and then squeeze a thing
[47:30.320 --> 47:34.560]  down and cinch it up on top of it keeps your shirts from getting wrinkled you can kind of pack
[47:34.560 --> 47:39.520]  more stuff in the suitcase by by sort of squeezing stuff in there it once you have it it's very
[47:39.520 --> 47:44.880]  obvious how it works it works great keeps your shirts from getting wrinkled really really love
[47:44.880 --> 47:50.640]  my away suitcase here's the deal they've got a special offer for listeners of the show go to
[47:50.640 --> 48:02.480]  awaytravel.com talk show 20 awaytravel.com talk show 20 the 20 is because you save 20 bucks off
[48:02.480 --> 48:09.680]  any suitcase just use that code talk show 20 during checkout and you'll save 20 bucks on any
[48:09.680 --> 48:13.520]  suitcase i cannot recommend this product enough i would recommend it to people even if they weren't
[48:13.520 --> 48:20.960]  a sponsor love their products my thanks to away travel um all right so here's the thing that i
[48:20.960 --> 48:26.400]  was thinking about to me one of the most telling things about swift ui is the fact that it's the
[48:26.400 --> 48:33.760]  first native third-party api for the watch and in fact it's going to be the only native api for the
[48:33.760 --> 48:41.440]  watch so up until now third-party developers have had to use quote-unquote watch kit and it's not
[48:41.440 --> 48:47.520]  native it's it's a weird hybrid sort of development thing i've never really heard anybody
[48:48.240 --> 48:55.280]  any of my developer friends say good things about it and it's not what apple itself uses to write
[48:55.280 --> 49:00.880]  the first party apps on the watch and i kind of touched on this on my live show i don't know it
[49:00.880 --> 49:08.560]  you know it time is limited but i i i really feel and and i've heard this from my developer friends
[49:08.560 --> 49:14.480]  over the years that you can always tell which apis apple itself uses and which ones they don't
[49:14.480 --> 49:20.480]  and it's just human nature you can think you can be altruistic and think hey we're not going to use
[49:20.480 --> 49:25.280]  this api but we want our third-party developers to have a great api for this we don't need it
[49:25.280 --> 49:33.120]  because we're going to use this internal non non-public api but we'll do a as good a job as we can
[49:33.120 --> 49:39.120]  on this public api if they're not using it it just it's just human nature it just isn't as good
[49:39.760 --> 49:46.720]  as as when apple itself is using it and you know i think it shows i think it showed you know i
[49:46.720 --> 49:52.080]  think for all of the popularity of the watch and the way that the watch has really blossomed
[49:52.080 --> 49:58.320]  in the four or five years since it debuted the third-party app story has always been a sore spot
[49:58.320 --> 50:03.680]  it was absolutely awful i i honestly shouldn't have shipped the first year i you know there
[50:03.680 --> 50:07.600]  must have been some i i'm sure there was some debate in the company as to whether they should
[50:07.600 --> 50:14.240]  have even shipped the original watch kit given how slow watch apps were to load so slow as to
[50:14.240 --> 50:18.320]  almost be unusable well and keep in mind at that point they were just being run like the watch was
[50:18.320 --> 50:22.720]  basically an external display they were entirely run on the iphone which is a root decision that
[50:22.720 --> 50:27.920]  i understand but it also like i feel like this is the moment where apple's like all right we are
[50:27.920 --> 50:33.920]  still uh dealing with that decision and it made all of these apps compromised and so now it's
[50:33.920 --> 50:38.080]  we're over it it's done yeah and you know and there were good technical reasons for it the
[50:38.080 --> 50:43.600]  original watch was so you know technically you know had low battery life it barely got through
[50:43.600 --> 50:49.920]  a day for most people and that was with all of the native code being apple's own code that they
[50:49.920 --> 50:55.280]  sweated over every single detail and every subroutine to make sure this isn't going to
[50:55.280 --> 50:59.920]  you know burn excessive battery life you know we got to be as cautious as we can
[51:01.200 --> 51:07.520]  i get it but i think it's so interesting that there's there is never going to be an objective
[51:07.520 --> 51:12.640]  c interface to writing a native watch app for third-party developers it's it's the first
[51:12.640 --> 51:20.240]  platform where it's swift all the way yeah it is it is and the thing that that really popped into
[51:20.240 --> 51:25.680]  my head and again it's it gets back to like what you said like with wiley uh you know they're not
[51:25.680 --> 51:32.240]  going to talk about the future but implicit at this wwdc is whatever the next platforms are
[51:32.240 --> 51:38.160]  going to be from apple whether it's like ar glasses or a car or something you know there's
[51:38.160 --> 51:43.840]  all sorts of stuff you know that they're rumored to be working on all of the anything that's coming
[51:43.840 --> 51:50.960]  from apple in the future is going to be swift ui both first party and third party yes as soon as
[51:50.960 --> 51:55.120]  they can and that they're you know when i asked josh and wiley that question i was like are people
[51:55.120 --> 51:59.520]  using this inside apple and they're like well some and i definitely got the impression i think they
[51:59.520 --> 52:04.800]  they suggested the idea that some people were able to use it the other people were not aware it
[52:04.800 --> 52:10.960]  existed yet and now would learn about it and be able to do it but it's clearly um it's clearly
[52:10.960 --> 52:15.760]  where they're going i had a question for you about swift ui and catalyst which is you've been a very
[52:15.760 --> 52:20.640]  cranky guy on twitter and on daring fireball about catalyst uh you've been skeptical you're you're
[52:20.640 --> 52:25.360]  sort of like are these going to be toy apps are these going to be bad apps and you know i'm more
[52:25.360 --> 52:30.800]  positive about it as somebody who really likes my ipad and my mac i look at it as this positive that
[52:30.800 --> 52:35.200]  there are apps that i would like to see on the mac that aren't there now because they're ios apps
[52:35.200 --> 52:40.800]  and uh bringing those over and having them be good mac apps makes my mac my mac better that said it's
[52:40.800 --> 52:46.160]  also very clear it's inevitable we're going to get some really lousy catalyst apps on the mac right
[52:46.160 --> 52:51.200]  that's inevitable that somebody who doesn't get the platform is going to do a half-assed job and
[52:51.200 --> 52:59.280]  there's going to be bad mac apps but my question for you is is is your concern about catalyst was
[52:59.280 --> 53:05.200]  it more motivated by the idea that in the end the only apps that apple would really let anybody
[53:05.200 --> 53:10.080]  write on the mac would be these catalyst things that were built for a platform that is very
[53:10.080 --> 53:15.360]  different from the mac and that that would be the future of the mac is just running kind of ios
[53:15.360 --> 53:21.760]  imports versus like is that mitigated now by the existence of something like swift ui where you say
[53:21.760 --> 53:26.960]  oh this is a transition technology i don't need to be concerned about it taking over the mac
[53:26.960 --> 53:32.640]  it's just for compatibility and transitional stuff and the future is this thing where the mac isn't
[53:32.640 --> 53:38.400]  like an equal partner it's one of the platforms and you know you can write apps am i i'm trying
[53:38.400 --> 53:42.560]  to kind of like deconstruct your attitude toward these two things and why because i feel like
[53:42.560 --> 53:47.280]  you were really concerned that the back was going to get screwed up by being kind of like just full
[53:47.280 --> 53:51.520]  of catalyst imports and now that's not a worry anymore because catalyst isn't the future it's
[53:51.520 --> 53:58.160]  a bridge and swift ui is the future i think it's a great question uh it's absolutely one of the
[53:58.160 --> 54:07.840]  top reasons i wanted to have you on this this first post-wwdc episode um i'm not so worried
[54:07.840 --> 54:14.720]  about i i'm very still or remain to this moment very skeptical about the utility of catalyst
[54:14.720 --> 54:22.240]  and um i don't think it's going to be a very good thing for the mac but i i kind of also think it's
[54:22.240 --> 54:32.640]  almost like a non-event and i do feel like the one underlying mystery of this year's wwdc
[54:32.640 --> 54:38.400]  is the relationship between swift ui and catalyst and inside apple and what
[54:38.400 --> 54:46.800]  what their messaging is on it and because they're clearly two entirely different products that are
[54:46.800 --> 54:53.040]  that for sure that were absolutely developed independently and neither one needs the other
[54:53.040 --> 55:00.000]  but they also clearly overlap in very broad and obvious ways which is hey if you want to share
[55:00.000 --> 55:05.360]  a code base between ios and mac os this is what you this is a way to do that
[55:05.360 --> 55:15.280]  um right i think that we are definitely going to see it i think most apps that are ported over
[55:15.280 --> 55:21.520]  with catalyst are going to be bad but i don't think that matters i've you know in one way i
[55:21.520 --> 55:27.760]  look back at this is that i kind of got the whole app store wrong just going back to the original
[55:27.760 --> 55:38.080]  2008 ios app store uh i thought back in 2008 that apple during their review process was going to be
[55:38.080 --> 55:46.640]  a lot more judgmental about the quality of apps and saying this isn't good enough and we're just
[55:46.640 --> 55:52.720]  going to reject this because it's it it's like amateur hour uh that didn't happen that didn't
[55:52.720 --> 55:59.200]  happen i i thought it would be more curated um like their retail stores right like so when you
[55:59.200 --> 56:04.480]  go into an apple retail store most of the stuff they sell is actually from apple but like when you
[56:04.480 --> 56:12.640]  go to the sides and you look at like the third party iphone cases they sell and stuff like uh
[56:12.640 --> 56:18.560]  external hard drives you can go in there and buy you know ssd drives and cables and and there's
[56:18.560 --> 56:22.720]  other you know there's a bunch of stuff on the sides that are from third party companies but
[56:22.720 --> 56:28.000]  it's all stuff that like you look at it and you think oh yeah this belongs in an apple store
[56:28.000 --> 56:34.160]  right it's not like going to amazon and shopping for stuff and you can find anything and everything
[56:34.160 --> 56:40.560]  from any chinese knockoff company you know that you can think of i thought the app store was going
[56:40.560 --> 56:48.960]  to be more like the physical apple retail stores curated and you know trying to to keep only high
[56:48.960 --> 56:53.520]  quality apps in the store and it obviously wasn't like that at all it's it's pretty much if it works
[56:53.520 --> 56:59.120]  and does what you say it does uh and doesn't break any rules then you're in and you know for maybe
[56:59.120 --> 57:05.360]  that's a better way maybe that's actually you know it there's a you know there if apple were more
[57:05.360 --> 57:12.320]  strict about keeping out stuff that just was kept out just because the ui wasn't good maybe we'd be
[57:12.320 --> 57:18.080]  having more discussions about you know antitrust sort of right control over the store almost need
[57:18.080 --> 57:22.560]  to allow side loading if they were that strict about it because you you could just completely
[57:22.560 --> 57:27.760]  arbitrarily knock software out of the store right you know in the mac like they one thing that
[57:27.760 --> 57:31.600]  surprised me is that catalyst apps that use catalyst don't have to be in the mac app store
[57:31.600 --> 57:35.520]  don't have to be in the mac app store that surprised me so it's it's open like they could
[57:36.240 --> 57:41.440]  they could say nope this is terrible they won't but they could do that and put it out of the mac
[57:41.440 --> 57:46.640]  app store they just bad apps won't get featured i think is what's going to happen right and so
[57:46.640 --> 57:50.720]  you know basically i expect that there will be a ton of bad apps i don't think it'll matter
[57:50.720 --> 57:57.920]  any worse than it has mattered for all these years that that there are tons of bad apps in the store
[57:57.920 --> 58:02.480]  and i think most catalyst apps are going to be bad apps and you know but somebody's going to make
[58:02.480 --> 58:06.880]  good ones and that's cool so i don't know if you saw that the the guy who does fair right which is
[58:06.880 --> 58:12.480]  the app that i use on ipad to edit podcasts no i did not see this he did a thread on twitter about
[58:12.480 --> 58:16.960]  what his thoughts are and and and you know he's like people are asking me and i i will admit i
[58:16.960 --> 58:22.080]  went and looked because i was curious if he had talked about it and um and fair it's a really
[58:22.080 --> 58:27.120]  good app it's a it's uh i honestly i want it on the mac because i think i would use it instead
[58:27.120 --> 58:32.400]  of logic if i if i could plus i would be able to edit on either platform and there's no way to take
[58:32.400 --> 58:37.840]  a logic project and put it on a mac and or put it on an ipad and go back and forth so i'm really
[58:37.840 --> 58:44.160]  interested in this and what he said was first off he's got a lot of improvements on ios to do for
[58:44.160 --> 58:50.960]  ios 13 and he's going to focus on those first and then after that he's going to look at the mac and
[58:50.960 --> 58:55.040]  and catalyst and find a way to do it but he says i'm going to take my time and i want to do it
[58:55.040 --> 58:59.440]  right and i think like that's going to be a good mac app when it comes out and i want to wait i
[58:59.440 --> 59:06.000]  don't want the lousy ios port version i want a really good mac app so that i can just switch my
[59:06.000 --> 59:10.640]  podcast editing over to it i think there will be apps like that i think there will be developers
[59:10.640 --> 59:15.680]  like that who really care about it and i'll just say i think one thing that catalyst catalyst is
[59:15.680 --> 59:19.360]  a bridge technology if you're writing something brand new you should probably try to do as much
[59:19.360 --> 59:23.600]  of it in swift and swift ui as possible but there's so much code that was written for ios
[59:23.600 --> 59:28.320]  that could be repurposed and the one area where i think it makes a lot of sense is going to be
[59:29.200 --> 59:33.520]  you think about apple combining the message of make a good ipad app and make a good mac app
[59:33.520 --> 59:41.200]  it's the addressable market of ipad and mac together is a better market than either of them
[59:41.200 --> 59:48.080]  separately and so ferrite's a great example this is an app that totally could have a market on the
[59:48.080 --> 59:54.080]  mac but he wrote it for ios so if he if he can take that and put it on the mac that's great and
[59:54.080 --> 01:00:00.080]  i think there are it's going to be a class of apps that are more pro focused more power user
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:07.520]  focused that are ios apps that will be able to run on the mac now and will be welcomed by mac users
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:11.680]  who you know because it makes more financial sense for the developers to put in the work
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:15.600]  because they've radically increased the addressable size of the market by writing
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:20.960]  something that goes to both ipad and mac so i think that's the for me that's the shining
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:27.360]  part of catalyst that and maybe some of the media apps just because like it kills me that i can do
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:32.800]  picture-in-picture on my ipad for major league baseball or for netflix or for xfinity for my
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:38.240]  like my cable streaming and i can't do it on my mac i gotta open chrome and put it and turn on
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:43.600]  flash and then just stick a window in the corner and it's terrible so if those media apps you know
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:49.520]  this is what it takes for them to do picture-in-picture on the mac i'll take it but i think it's those
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:54.240]  two kinds of apps that are going to be the ones that i want to see out of catalyst yeah and the
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:58.640]  other one that i think is going to be a win but i could be totally wrong and and and it's almost
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:05.120]  irrelevant to my own personal usage is games and i i feel like the game story could be huge and i
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:11.520]  know i don't think it's a complete coincidence i i do feel like you said this about half an hour
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:16.240]  ago i think on the show where it was just like a bunch of a couple of multi-year projects that
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:22.560]  came together this year right right and and when you've got projects that maybe you're on a hey
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:27.360]  this is going to take three years this might take four years before we can even get it to the shape
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:34.480]  where it's ready to be unveiled and you have a couple of projects on these multi-year development
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:42.240]  before you even unveil it it it's just a a matter of luck whether a bunch of them come out the same
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:47.040]  year or not right it's just the way that the math works out that wow here's a three-year project
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:52.240]  here's a four-year project they're all ready in 2019 here they are don't expect this much new
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:58.560]  stuff every year it just doesn't work like that um i i don't know though that it's a complete
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:05.920]  coincidence that in the year that they're pushing apple arcade as a new major service that that this
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:13.360]  technology that could really open up a bunch of ios games to the mac uh is at the same time i i
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:20.480]  think that that's a major factor in that in the whole internal politics of is catalyst worthwhile
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:28.000]  swift ui to me is a no-brainer like and and when you hear craig fedorigi talk about it it's clear
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:34.400]  clear that like when he was shown it and he got it he was like a hundred percent on board he was
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:41.680]  like i'll go down guns a-blazing to make sure this happens like he he's like a bigger swift ui
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:48.800]  enthusiast than josh is right and josh is the guy who made it yeah um i think catalyst was was more
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:54.400]  of a political battle i i just from what they say publicly and just what we know about it i think
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:59.760]  because it's you know trade-offs it's it's it's a bridging technology it's not it's not really
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:05.760]  that exciting it is the solution to a major problem which is apple's biggest base of developers
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:10.240]  use max but don't know how to write mac apps and they've got a huge amount of code that isn't
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:15.520]  existing and even if you've got a new way to do apps that you're going to roll out maybe even the
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:20.160]  same year what do they do with all their existing code because then you're like hey swift ui
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:24.080]  but only the swift ui parts will work on the mac the rest of the work you did won't translate
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:30.480]  it's like like it's almost like a it's not like catalyst isn't going to evolve but catalyst is
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:37.280]  all about like we need to get this code base to be portable and now it is great and that like that's
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:42.880]  what it's for and and because again the ferrite guy he will like bb edit he will probably over
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:49.440]  time if if that app still exists in 10 years it will probably have been rewritten to use swift
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:55.360]  and swift ui probably like yeah yeah let's say that um but in the short term he's not going to
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:58.720]  rewrite it to bring it to the mac that's not going to happen so catalyst is there for that
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.600]  i only say this half joking i think i wrote this at some point on during firewall but effectively
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:12.080]  it was almost as though catalyst was announced at wwdc and effectively deprecated later in the
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:17.600]  same keynote at wwdc and that doesn't mean it don't use it don't touch it don't you you know
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:21.600]  that it won't be an important thing for the next few years but it's clear like you said it's a
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:26.240]  bridging technology from we thought it was the future and it turns out it is a transitional
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:34.000]  technology and that swift ui is the future and swift and that's yeah it that's why i think
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.320]  there is a strong argument that they that they really needed to announce these things
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:43.760]  for developers simultaneously because what you don't want is to give the developers this idea
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:48.320]  that what you really need to do is just start building ios apps for the mac that's that's how
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:53.920]  you get to the mac they're like no no this is for your it's basically like this is for your existing
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:05:00.080]  code the new stuff do it over here because this is the future for everything um all right let me
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:05.760]  take a break thank our next sponsor another long time friend of the show our good friends at ero
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:14.720]  ee ro ero gives you wi-fi at your house and they do it in the best way with a mesh network instead
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:19.680]  of having one base station somewhere maybe by your tv because that's where your cable box is
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:26.560]  or something like that and then trying to saturate your whole house with a network from one device
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:31.840]  ero gives you multiple devices some of them just tiny little like night lights literally that
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:37.360]  optionally have a night light that you can just plug in a socket and control through the app and
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:42.560]  just have it show a little light to to walk your footway down the hallway or wherever you put it
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:51.120]  in your house uh absolutely a better way to do wi-fi in a house that's more than like one room
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:58.480]  and they've also got the new product ero plus which is a service and it's it it defends your
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:05.920]  network against security threats blocks malware you can configure it to block phishing attacks
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:11.920]  you can configure it per device so like you could say like your kids maybe their devices
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:18.560]  aren't allowed to access adult content stuff like that you can configure it all it sounds like oh
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:23.280]  boy that would be complicated you'd have to be like a network administrator you do it all through
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:30.240]  the app on your phone and in my opinion as much as i love ero's hardware their software is better
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:37.680]  than the hardware because it it simplifies wi-fi network management to the level you want it to be
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:44.160]  simplified to while giving you the control that you would want i don't know why i have mine set
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:50.160]  up i love it i like to have a notification every time a new new device joins my network and like
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:54.960]  maybe my son has a friend come home after school gives him the password to our wi-fi and i get a
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:59.360]  little notification that there's a new apple iphone that joined the network i like knowing
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:04.000]  that i don't know why i love it it's it but if you don't want to know stuff like that you can
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:10.160]  configure it not to do it ero plus even has content blocking so that you can do stuff like
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:17.040]  block ads right at the network level it it's really great they offer vpn protection if you
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:24.080]  want from encrypt.me they have integrated when you have ero plus you can even get password
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:30.720]  management from one password all best of breed software it really is a great product you're
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:36.320]  listening to me talk to jason right now over an ero network that i've had for years right here
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:42.720]  at my house and everything you want all the wpa2 encryption they've got all these other talking
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:47.440]  points anything you want that's like secure like that they've got it and they even offer great
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:51.920]  customer support i really doubt you need it i've only had i think i had to call them once i forget
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:57.520]  what it was for but i did call them once like a year or two ago fantastic customer support it
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:01.680]  took me like five minutes to get whatever it was i don't even remember what it was but for the most
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:06.480]  part you don't even need it but if you do need it you can get a hold of a wi-fi expert within 30
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:12.320]  seconds typically and they'll talk you through everything you need to do uh so honestly i think
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:18.320]  it's a great product really really like it so never think about wi-fi again if you need a new
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:24.160]  wi-fi system at your house you can get a hundred dollars off the ero base unit and two beacons
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:29.840]  package that's a base station little thing about the size of an apple tv and then the beacons are
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:33.200]  the little night light things you can plug in around your house that gives you three little
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:40.320]  devices saturate your whole house if you need more or you need less fewer devices they'll talk
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:46.720]  you through it on the website but that that ero base unit two beacons package with one year of
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:54.000]  ero plus service you can get for a hundred dollars off by going to ero.com slash the talk show and
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.960]  just remember that code the talk show when you check out and you'll get that hundred dollars off
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:07.200]  the the uh that package my thanks to ero you've got the ero right i do they're they're uh my whole
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:13.200]  house now i realized i put in this smart irrigation uh controller and uh as i'm you know attaching it
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:17.520]  to the wall i thought oh no is there wi-fi over here but there is because there's an ero beacon
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:22.800]  in my bedroom and it's right behind that so so yeah i can sit in the backyard and do my stuff
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:26.720]  you were just talking about that on one of your podcasts right yeah yeah i just i i just never
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:30.800]  even thought about like oh no what if there's no wi-fi out here because this is not a place where
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:36.080]  anybody goes it's the side yard with the gravel and like the tool shed and stuff like that and
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:41.760]  now this this irrigation controller but yeah it gets it it's not a problem that's a great service
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:51.360]  um all right here's my thing about the catalyst apps though is i have to say this the the apps
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:57.840]  that apple is shipping using catalyst there's four that debuted last year yeah at wwdc and they
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:05.280]  shipped as part of mojave and they're still there in catalina news and stocks which are a very
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:10.240]  similar apps i i don't even know i i bet they share a lot of code because the stocks app is
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:18.160]  mostly it shows you stock prices but for the most part shows you business news it's just it's just
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:23.040]  like the business section of apple news yeah for the most part news about stocks is what it is
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:32.080]  voice memos and home uh-huh and then there's a new one this year the podcast app which we can get to
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:38.640]  but of those original four and find my is also oh okay find my is all right um
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:51.200]  i i'm absolutely boggled that the original four marzipan apps were touched so barely in in the
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:56.400]  intervening year because there were so many problems with it with them so many ways that
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:03.280]  they are just bad mac apps and at some point in recent months i just sort of gave up and i thought
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:12.080]  well i'll just shut up until i see what they ship at wwdc and if anything that they're worse i mean
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:17.360]  like the the apple news app at some point one of the complaints i had i know other people had was
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:22.800]  that there was no way to copy the original url so like let's say you're reading a story from
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:30.560]  the washington post and it's in apple news you can copy the apple news url and then paste it
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:36.720]  to somebody and then if if they're on an apple device it'll open in the apple news app but what
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:43.120]  i would want to do is send them the original story at washingtonpost.com and certainly what
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:47.760]  i would want to do if i want to link to it at daring fireball is linked to that original story
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:53.760]  sure on ios it was possible it's always been possible to get those urls you could just say
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:58.400]  open in safari and then it opens in safari and then you have the original url on the mac you
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:02.560]  couldn't which seems crazy it seems like if either of the platforms was going to have
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:08.560]  a more powerful nerdy give me a different you know give me the original url it would be the
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:14.080]  mac they didn't have it and we complained about it and then they added it i think it was in the
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:19.200]  file menu or something it was it was weird it would also it was in the whole way that catalyst
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:24.960]  just seems weird it was like the way they added the feature still seemed weird it was like why is
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:29.600]  it in the file menu it's in the file menu it's open in safari and there's no keyboard shortcuts
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:34.720]  right yeah why is this in the file shouldn't this be an edit shouldn't it be like an alternate to
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:39.760]  like copy url and copy original url right and shouldn't it also be in the share button that's
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:47.280]  right there right it should be in yeah why is it not in the share button well anyway now that that's
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:51.920]  gone it's we're back to not even having it so like when you're in catalina there's no way to
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:57.520]  get the original url anymore and i realize now all of a sudden i i've just suddenly popped into
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:04.000]  my head that like a month ago molts was on my show and i promised that i would share my my script for
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.280]  turning an apple news url into the original url and i i still haven't done that so all right i've
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:13.600]  popped it back into my head i'll i'll get that right one of these days you know my the one that
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:18.720]  drives drives me crazy is that in automation in the home app uh when you set a time and it it's
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:24.720]  uh the spinner yeah which is a delightful delightful uh touchscreen interface right it's
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:30.400]  whimsical and functional and much better than like having to type in a time on the keyboard
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:37.200]  or something on the mac it is a disaster like it is it is malpractice for that to still be in there
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:43.200]  and i am also and like i i hope i am trying to heap scorn on it this summer in the hopes that
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:49.280]  somebody at apple will hear the rising scorn and be like guys can you just fix that please did you
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:54.720]  see i i tweeted a day or two ago just like a screen recording of that interface in the home
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:14:02.800]  app and also in addition to the fact that it is a very bad control the the the ios touch date picker
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:08.960]  is a very bad control for a mouse pointer interface yes but in addition when you resize the window
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:16.560]  it it does really bizarre things when you get to a certain minimum height it it suddenly jumps to
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:20.880]  a different size class oh yeah it snaps to the sides of the window instead of floating in the
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:25.840]  center right but and in addition to the fact that that's not that shouldn't be what it does on the
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:32.160]  mac it's just not a good mac interface the fact that there's no animation also it just seems so
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:36.640]  junky it's also a fake window inside a window right it's this fake window that looks like a
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:40.320]  window but you can't click on it you can't slide it around it's not really a window they've just
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:45.440]  grayed out the back and locked this modal thing and yeah it's bad and i again i was forgiving in
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:50.080]  mohavi because it's like well this is bad uh but first and during the beta it was like surely they'll
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:53.920]  fix this by the time they ship that didn't happen but at least we get the functionality and it's not
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:58.080]  for third parties yet so surely next year when they improve this technology and hopefully give
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:02.400]  it a name which they did uh it will be better and those apps still don't seem to have been
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:07.680]  touched and craig fedorigi has said some very weird things to journalists where he said he said
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:14.080]  well a lot of those things that you have ascribed to uh catalyst is really actually just a design
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:18.400]  decision and i think to myself is he kind of throwing his designers under the bus there
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:23.280]  because what he's basically saying is oh our technology is great we just made terrible choices
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:33.680]  like really really they've spent the entire mac os 10 era i mean ever since aqua was unveiled
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:39.920]  right i mean there was this back when it was called rhapsody there were a couple of developer
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:47.520]  betas that used the old platinum ui interface which were and they were kind of fascinating
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:53.840]  builds you know because they were super fast it was really an exciting time to be a mac user you
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:16:00.240]  know it's like 1999 and there's like rhapsody developer beta 2 and it looked like mac os 9
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:06.800]  except it was a little slightly different platinum interface but it was super fast it was very snappy
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:10.320]  but it was like but this isn't what we're going to ship you know wait wait for it and then they
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:17.520]  showed us aqua and aqua was way more eye candy right at all that everything was anti-aliased
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:23.520]  instead of bitmap fonts and and there were shadows and transparency and all this stuff
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:31.440]  and it looked way fancier but it was slow right i mean that was the early era of mac os 10 was
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:36.560]  that even on like the fastest hardware you could buy from apple it was kind of a slow interface
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:44.000]  because they so emphasized the visual effects you know the shadows and the transparency and
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.440]  the animation right the animation was a huge part of it everything that could be animated was
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:55.520]  animated you hit command s and the save sheet drops out of the top of the menu and comes down
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:01.040]  and if you hit the cancel button it doesn't just disappear it slides back up into the top of the
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:11.040]  thing and all these years later effectively almost 20 years later and and the if anything ios took
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:20.080]  the animated aspect of the interface and and went even further with it and i think it was so
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:27.440]  important to the way that people could just look at the original iphone 10 years ago and just get
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:35.600]  it was the way that almost most of the major apps in the in ios on the iphone kind of work in a
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:42.000]  column view sort of way where this column view metaphor that just take it from the finder where
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:47.760]  at the top level it's on the left and you drill into a folder and it fills in to the right as you
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:55.040]  keep going down in the hierarchy most ios apps work like that like you're in mail and you see
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:00.320]  a list of accounts and you tap one of your accounts and then it slides over to the left
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:05.440]  and then you got your inbox for that account and it has a bunch of messages and you tap on a message
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:11.840]  and it slides over to the left and now you see the message and you keep you know but the actual
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:19.280]  animation gives you a mental layout of the app and you you kind of understand when you're in mail
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:24.880]  or messages or even in the settings app that you're in this sort of left to right the deeper
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:28.960]  you go the further right you are and you just keep going back to the left to go back to the root level
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:38.720]  the animation reiterates all that to have this thing now in a mac in 2019 where the view doesn't
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:44.400]  animate at all you just suddenly snap between the minimum height requirement of the window
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:51.840]  and it just snaps to be full screen with no animation at all it feels like the most
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:59.520]  unhappily experience i can imagine it really just it you know i get it i see what's going on i
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:04.160]  understand that it's because i made the window too small and now it's at this point where the
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:10.640]  the the little sheet is going to be full width instead of looking like a fake window in a window
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:16.080]  but the fact that there's no animation between it even though it's it's not a good experience
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:22.960]  overall anyway but the lack of animation just feels so anti-apple it's it's really hard to
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:29.520]  believe that it came out of apple i i i'm baffled by these apps yeah the one that i've noticed and
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:38.880]  again it's beta it's early but the podcast app on on catalina so that's um that's that's a catalyst
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:46.720]  app and uh you remember back in the early days of os 10 the interface convention for showing more
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:52.960]  information was these drawers that slid out right and it was a animated process and they had a lot
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:57.360]  of chrome on them and and we've gone away from that you don't do that anymore but i was thinking
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:04.880]  about them because in podcasts if you want uh to see uh and this is actually true actually this is
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:09.040]  true in the music app too so i should use the music app as an example even though that's not
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:13.840]  catalyst because it's using this like design language that apple has worked on that seems
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:21.200]  to be very influenced by ios in the music app up next and lyrics when you show them in itunes they
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:26.320]  pop it's a popover that comes down from the center of the screen it pops over and it's like a
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:35.840]  temporary view in music it's this drawer that slides out from the inside of this window over
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:43.200]  the ui and the ui stays active but is is is covered partially by this thing and i thought
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:50.800]  okay one i see why you would need this on a full screen app like you would have on an ipad but two
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:57.280]  it's a drawer and it's going the wrong way right like it's like why would you build an interface
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:03.920]  and i know the answer is because this was built that we're using ipad uh conventions here and
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:08.320]  and even though this is not a catalyst app we're using those conventions so that it feels like the
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:15.360]  music app on the ipad but on a mac i look at it and i just think no this is wrong like i've got
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:22.080]  i got a 27-inch monitor here right why are you covering my content to show me what's up next or
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:26.800]  the lyrics it doesn't make any sense from that perspective it's a choice made for good reason
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:32.720]  on a different platform and then applied to this platform uh kind of like i don't know consistency
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:36.960]  over usability i guess is what's happening there it's frustrating it's really frustrating yeah
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:42.640]  because it it's a perfect example i know exactly which thing you're talking about you there's a
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:50.960]  button right above it and it it is animated and it looks nice but on the ipad typically your music
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:58.640]  app is full screen it is the the size of your ipad is the size of your music app or the podcast app
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:02.080]  if that's what you're listening yeah and certainly even if you did a split view or something like
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:09.120]  that it there there's no concept on ios of a window kind of like exploding into another space
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:14.160]  to another space that's just not doesn't happen exactly even if you're in split view
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:21.600]  it you the app is given you know okay you've got a two-thirds of the size of the screen square or
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:28.080]  you've got a one-third over on the right you know column you can't grow as the app you you've got
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:36.640]  this space so if you want to show more it needs to overlap the content but on the mac a roughly
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:44.320]  and i'm i'm talking to you on a on a 5k imac and i'm holding up my ipad right in front of it and
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:51.200]  a roughly ipad-sized window is a perfect window size for the music app or the podcast app on the
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:57.280]  mac if you have a nice big uh like imac display perfectly reasonable size but if you need to
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:04.800]  show more there's plenty of room on the screen to show more off to the side instead of overlapping
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:12.800]  the content it is it seems like a very strange concession for the mac to make in the in the
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:17.360]  grounds of consistency right right because it's a cross i mean this is the problem with cross
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:22.560]  platform interfaces is every platform is different and has unique characteristics and i i wouldn't
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:29.280]  want some sort of weird drawer exclusion exclusion sorry extrusion thing on my ipad that would make
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:33.520]  no sense but on the mac i look at it and i immediately like i i used this app for the
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:39.440]  first time the other day and i immediately was like whoa like why is that happening and it's
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:44.720]  not like i haven't seen like the music app in ios 13 puts up this little slide over thing for
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:48.560]  now playing and it literally grays out the rest of the interface and you can't interact with it
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:53.040]  but it's not actually a slide over and you can't move it it just sits you can dismiss it and that's
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:58.640]  all you can do and i had that same thought of sort of like is this what we want is these weird things
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:02.640]  that float on top of other things and block them but at least in the ipad i can understand some of
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:06.880]  the rationale on the mac the only rationale is well that's how we do it on the ipad
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:15.120]  and so there's a weird thing uh i tweeted about it i tweeted this movie i recorded with the home
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:23.760]  thing uh and uh absolute genius steven trout and smith who's spent more time deconstructing how
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:30.240]  these apps work before they were even announced yeah like he knows as much about how these marzipan
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:36.720]  apps used to work and how they work now as anybody outside apple and he said something i can't find
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:41.840]  the tweet right now but said something to the effect that the podcast app seemingly is written
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:49.840]  using some catalyst features that aren't publicly available yeah so like the fact that the like the
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:54.800]  catalyst app is or the podcast app is the saving grace of catalyst so far because you can look at
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:25:00.160]  it and say well this feels like a mac app there's some there's some you know some things that are a
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:07.600]  little off but they're at the edges they're truly edge cases of the interface sure and overall it
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:12.480]  seems this seems like a real mac app and it doesn't feel like an ios app running on the mac
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:16.960]  although some of that is that what what we were talking about a second ago some of that is that
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:22.800]  you compare it to music and you which is which is not catalyst and you compare it to tv which is not
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:28.400]  catalyst but they've got new interfaces that are the same interface that podcast is so some of it
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:33.200]  is moving the goalposts a little bit right right right because some of right they've matched the
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:41.680]  the you know the podcast app has some superpowers seemingly to be more mac like and right and then
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:46.240]  the other side it seems like they took the music and tv apps and made them a little less mac like
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:50.640]  to to even it up to just get the get them to be a little bit closer together yeah because they do
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:54.160]  feel of a kind right they're all from the same sort of design language they're all trying to
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:58.240]  hit the same target even though one of them is catalyst and they're clearly yeah they're clearly
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:04.960]  from the same team they're clearly from the itunes team uh i i have to mention this if i didn't
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:11.840]  mention it i would kill myself after the show for not mentioning it but i love so we know apple
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:17.680]  effectively admitted i think it certainly is true i think they more or less admitted though that
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:24.560]  what they did is they took the old itunes app and and took out a bunch of features redid the
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:31.120]  interface but it's not just the music app it's also the tv app so effectively we've got two
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:35.520]  versions of itunes now on catalina yeah plus a bunch of code that runs in the finder now so
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:41.600]  hey right finders itunes now too a little bit right so they yeah so what we used to know is
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:53.520]  itunes for uh geez what uh 18 years you know right 2001 right 2001 it was before the ipod
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:59.120]  actually right right itunes came first so yeah almost 20 years yeah yeah so 20 years of itunes
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:05.760]  they've taken the code and they've they've forked it once to make the music app and it has all the
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:10.560]  music features that we used to know from itunes they forked it a second time to make the tv app
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:15.040]  which is interesting to me because it seems to me like the tv app maybe could have gone
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:23.440]  the podcast route and i'm very curious why they decided to do you know do it the way they did
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:29.920]  me too i my theory is that there are projects at apple that have been in the works for long enough
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:34.400]  that they had already gone down the path of building a mac version and so why throw that
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:38.720]  work out when you already did it so that that's that's my theory is like the tv app they were
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:43.040]  already working on it and then catalyst comes along and they're like well you know you're still
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:47.840]  working on catalyst we're already down this path we'll just keep going down the path yeah and then
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:52.400]  they took all of the device management stuff and put it in the finder which is brilliant right
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:56.240]  doesn't that seem like the way it should have been like i i don't know why i never i i wished
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:01.840]  as soon as i saw that in the keynote and they put that in the finder so like if you want to manually
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:08.880]  manage uh your the backup of your iphone or your ipad or whatever device you you connect to your
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:14.480]  mac you do it in the finder now and that that seems so perfect it's like yeah that's that's
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:18.640]  exactly the job of the finder that would be yeah that's great it breaks the metaphor a little bit
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:21.840]  because the finder windows are supposed to have like files in them and now suddenly there's a
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:26.320]  device management window in the finder but on another level i agree with you because like i've
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:30.320]  always been frustrated that you couldn't just plug in an iphone to a mac and and drag files
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:35.600]  and drag files onto it right it just seems you have to go to itunes i mean so now you can yeah
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:46.720]  without going into a four hour we should uh add john syracuse to the show digression on the the
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:54.320]  user interface of the finder in the mac os 10 era vis-a-vis the classic finder and all that
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:29:04.160]  again it would easily be four hours we would have to get john syracuse given the os 10 finder it it
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:10.560]  just seems right that a device you plug in should show up in the finder sidebar it's it's really
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:15.040]  for sure yeah well it certainly makes more sense than a weird button that grows out of the itunes
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:20.480]  title bar right like what in your music playing app yeah it doesn't it doesn't make sense but
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:25.360]  you're right the tv app is uh is itunes like it's the tv parts of itunes that they've just
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:29.520]  tv and movie parts of itunes that they've taken and added some other stuff too so the thing i
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:36.000]  want to mention and i i just love it and i really almost wonder whether they're trolling us at this
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:42.560]  point is the fact you know what i'm going to say right the preferences window is still a modal
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:50.800]  dialogue of course of course so music and tv have modal dialogues for preferences and i think most
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:55.200]  people listening to the show already know exactly exactly what i'm talking about and why it's a
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:30:02.960]  little antiquated but if you don't just the basic idea is that a modal dialogue is one that when you
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:09.920]  open it up in an app you can't do in anything in any other windows until you cancel or okay the
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:15.760]  the app so when you open preferences and this is itunes has always been this way going back to
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:21.200]  before mac os 10 when it was a classic app is you'd open the preferences and you could change
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:27.360]  settings but then there's an okay and cancel button at the bottom so you could you could hit
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:32.800]  cancel and then any of the changes you made wouldn't actually be registered because you
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:39.120]  canceled it instead of okaying it and in the 90s maybe even going back to the 80s that was a very
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:44.960]  common i mean the the further back in time you go in mac history the more stuff was modal as opposed
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:50.560]  to non-modal where it would come up and you had to do it or cancel it right then and there and
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:54.720]  you couldn't do anything else until you did yeah everything else stopped while you were in there
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:31:00.400]  by the way i have a little real-time follow-up they bought i they bought sound jam mp in 2000
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:06.000]  but the first version of itunes actually did come out in 2001 it was january 2001 before the ipod
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:11.040]  right but not a lot before the ipod right only a little less than a year macworld expo
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:18.800]  2001 yeah 10 months before the ipad or ipod shipped yep yep um there's a lot of email so
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:26.240]  there it is the fact that itunes stuck with a modal preferences dialogue and i believe it's
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:32.880]  the last app apple has with a modal i mean maybe there's some kind of obscure app is somewhere in
[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:38.880]  in slash applications slash utilities maybe some of those still have it i don't know but in terms
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:45.200]  of the ones that would ever even vaguely have a chance of being demoed in a keynote itunes was
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:52.320]  far and away the last app apple made with a modal preferences dialogue and they clearly did a
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:59.760]  complete ui re-skinning of the you know the the the brand new catalina music and tv apps don't
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:06.480]  look like itunes on on mojave right the fact that they left the preferences as a modal dialogue box
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:12.320]  i love it i i i acts you know what i mean like i feel like we've circled the globe on this and
[01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:18.880]  we've gone away from like complaining like isn't it time for the itunes preferences not to be modal
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:26.160]  and just you know just it's out it's literally outlasted itunes now the preferences box has
[01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:33.760]  outlasted its app i at this point i'm actually so charmed that they kept it as a modal dialogue box
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:39.520]  and then of course i checked podcasts and podcasts is not modal you know the podcast which is catalyst
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:48.640]  app but looks a lot like the music app and the tv app not modal uh i i just it charms me now at this
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:54.160]  point and i really if anybody at apple is on these teams and i i would love to know the story behind
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:33:00.800]  this because technically it can't be that hard it can't be that there are with all of the work that
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:06.960]  went into to splitting the music and tv apps from what was itunes surely part of that work could
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:13.200]  have been making the preferences non-modal i feel like it's a deliberate choice at this point and i
[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:18.080]  kind of love it when you talk about coming all the way back around the world i will point out that
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:24.480]  automation uh box that we were talking about in the home app i mean that that there we're back
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:29.040]  there now because that is literally a modal it blocks out everything else that happens in the
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:33.840]  home app while it's open so you know the modal modal dialogues are back in style is what i'm
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:41.840]  saying so and what if you never left well itunes never left and now it's it's like you know 80s
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:50.000]  comes back in style 90s comes back in style wait long enough and you'll be back in style
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.760]  i absolutely love it that it's
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:34:05.280]  um what are you running i'm curious what betas you're running personally so i um i had installed
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:12.800]  the uh catalina beta on a an external ssd that's sort of my first step because with the mac you
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:17.840]  don't have to commit your whole device to being on it you can you can use a partition or an ssd
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:24.480]  marco uh arment used realized that apfs will let you partition things and i realized i've just been
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:32.160]  so trained from hfs to not ever ever touch the partitions of my internal hard drive that i just
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:38.640]  have a i have a samsung ssd that is so small that i can like tuck it in the back of my imax uh
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:45.440]  like little visa mount and it's like it's not even there uh so i can reboot into into catalina
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:49.120]  and that's step one step two will be that i'll move but step one i reboot into catalina and it
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:54.240]  means i can like attach that drive to my wife's macbook air when she's at work and i can boot into
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:59.680]  it on that one and use it as reference and then for ios i have like test devices that have been
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:06.000]  running it but yesterday i put it on my ipad um mostly at the urging of federico vatici who
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.440]  uh was talking about this on a podcast and basically said well if you're a regular person
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:13.440]  you shouldn't install this beta yet but if you're a uh if you're right about this for a living you
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:18.320]  should probably do it and i thought oh he's talking to me so i did it and it's you know it's
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:22.960]  once you go over the beta i i firmly believe that you have to use the beta on your main system
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:27.440]  to really understand anything right like because otherwise you're just kind of noodling around in
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:34.160]  an empty shell and then you leave it and like you don't i've already learned in 12 hours or 18 hours
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:38.880]  of using it on my main ipad i've already learned like a dozen things i didn't notice in the last
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:44.880]  week and a half because it's my ipad now so at some point you got to cut over but like i'm going
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:51.360]  on vacation next week and i'm not gonna put it on my phone like no way and but on the ipad i figure
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:56.720]  because i do need to immerse myself in this stuff i need to get there and i feel like in the next
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:01.600]  few weeks i will probably do a thing where here's let me know what you think about this strategy
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:06.640]  what i'm thinking of doing is i've got i bought a um so this external drive is a terabyte and my
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:14.000]  internal imac pro drive is a terabyte so what i'm thinking is cloning my existing mohavi on to that
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:20.240]  external drive and then upgrading to catalina because that'll let me live with catalina but
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:26.880]  also like have a place i can retreat to um for things like doing podcasts where you don't want
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:31.760]  your apps to crash and stuff like that that sounds a lot like my strategy let's uh let's take a third
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:36.160]  break here and thank our third and final sponsor of the episode another one of my very favorite
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:45.280]  companies mac weldon mac weldon makes uh they call men's essentials look t-shirts underwear socks
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:53.120]  socks that sort of thing uh and they're just super high quality they are the nicest stuff i've ever
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:59.440]  owned uh i i love it i'm wearing them right now i got a pair of mac weldon underwear on whoever
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:04.400]  thought i'd grow up and uh part of my life would be to tell everybody what kind of underwear i've
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:11.440]  got well that's where i am i love mac weldon products they'd started from scratch they've
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:18.640]  looked at this market and this is why i like this company they engineered everything even their own
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:24.000]  fabrics they start from the ground up they make their own fabrics they make their own designs
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:30.000]  they control all of the stitching and the sizing and they truly believe that the difference is in
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:36.080]  the details and they obsess over every stitch and seam until they've reached their definition of
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:42.400]  perfect for products like underwear t-shirts socks i get almost guaranteed that whatever you're
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:46.640]  wearing right now as you listen to this mac weldon products are better than what you have
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:57.760]  on right now great stuff i love them and they've even got their silver line is made of naturally
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:05.840]  anti-mac microbial fabrics that means they eliminate odor sounds like bs you think like uh
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:11.040]  you know how can you make a t-shirt that uh stays odor free as opposed to another thing i don't know
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:17.760]  how they do it but it works it's great stuff love them for summer that silver line of products
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:24.080]  especially the shirts absolutely terrific for hot weather super comfortable super stylish
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:30.320]  and anything you could ask for in these products mac weld and stuff is great and the ordering
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:34.480]  process is great they have a wonderful website once you they know what you've got so like you
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:39.440]  know stuff like underwear and socks you kind of have to reorder every year so uh they remember
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:44.240]  what you've got you can remember what you like just reorder the stuff that you already like
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:49.600]  really just a great shopping experience uh i like everything they have i like their t-shirts like
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:54.720]  their underwear like their socks and they have a special offer for listeners of the talk show

[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:14.880]  and uh glad they're still a sponsor to the show mac weldon.com and remember that code talk show
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:22.880]  uh what were we talking about before the break beta strategies ah beta strategy that's exactly
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:28.160]  right so i feel like everybody in our racket has these exact same samsung drives right everybody
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:35.120]  it's the samsung t5 i'm looking at it right now i've got like three of them connected to my imac
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:40.880]  right now so i've got one for catalina i got my time machine is on one uh-huh i have a two gigabyte
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:46.000]  two terabyte one for storage i just bought another one for time machine because i realized i was
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:51.280]  backing up time machine to my server over my network and that because it's a raid it's actually
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:56.240]  kind of slow and i thought why why do i not just have an ssd tucked behind my imac for backup so
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:01.440]  now i've got two of those guys but they're great all things considered i don't i just don't like
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:06.800]  samsung as a company i don't like their television sets i certainly don't want their phones don't
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:13.280]  really like their computers i there's a you know i just not a fan of the company but you know they
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:20.560]  make good ssd's and i think that they're portable these t5 portable ssd's are one of the best
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:26.320]  products i've ever had in my life and it's funny because like i've been buying them for at least a
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:33.280]  year a couple of years now they're so much cheaper than they used to be it is absolutely ludicrous
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:39.680]  like i went to amazon i bought a new one just to install catalina and it was like i got like a two
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:46.240]  terabyte drive for like one third of the price that i bought a one terabyte for like 18 months
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:50.800]  ago it was it's absolutely ridiculous how how cheap they're getting and they're just these
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:58.160]  tiny little things with one usb-c port in the back they come with both cables that you would
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:06.080]  possibly want which is usb-c to usb-c and usb-a to usb-c so you can connect it to they have nice
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:11.520]  little cables that are to me a very smart length they're not too super short but they're not like
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:19.360]  six foot you know uh it one of the great products uh that i could recommend are these samsung t5
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:24.000]  drives i did the same thing i've got catalina running on an external ssd i did the same thing
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:30.560]  as you where i there was no way as a you know again i i admit technically i think we're wrong
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:36.480]  and marco's probably the right way that we should just trust apfs and you know trust that you can
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:44.400]  repartition your internal uh drive with apfs and have a safe thing where you can put catalina
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:51.120]  but i i'm so old school that i not only install it on an external ssd i unmount my internal hard
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:55.520]  drive i reboot you know yeah one of the weird things about installing catalina is you couldn't
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:42:00.320]  just install it on a blank drive you had to start with mohavi i think you went through the same
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:04.080]  thing i think you were talking about this on a podcast yeah i installed mohavi and then i install
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:12.160]  no you had marco marco says that you can download the mohavian or the catalina installer and then
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:18.800]  point it at a blank drive and it will actually do it but i i decided i was not going to risk getting
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:23.920]  my mac in a position where it was going to try to install catalina on itself because that would be
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:28.880]  disaster so i yeah we've been trained by the mac for 20 years to not do that we've just got
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:33.040]  terrible terrible battle scars we're just like whatever you say you know like if they tell you
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:37.760]  that you're supposed to stand on one leg and hop up and down as the installer runs i would do it
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:44.880]  i think that's how you zap the pram yeah zap your pram and hold down uh six buttons and on your
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:49.760]  keyboard as it restarts just hope that it all works so yeah yeah you use the external drive
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:55.760]  and it's like and like you said in in in the racket we're in you gotta have you you gotta do
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:43:01.920]  it right but you gotta have strategies for it because you are going to have an unstable system
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:06.560]  like fund even a good beta it is an unstable system i had that happen i want to say three
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:13.200]  summers ago i finally cut over to the beta and realized that all of my podcasting broke when i
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:20.960]  did it so i spent like two months where every time uh somebody wanted me to do a podcast i i said okay
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:26.800]  i will uh be back in five minutes after i reboot because i had i ended up with an external drive
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:31.600]  that was just a generic version of the shipping operating system that would actually work with
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:36.720]  podcasting so that's that's the problem of having your test machine be your production machine as
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:41.760]  it were is that you're just uh yeah at some point you got to use the betas though because you got
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:46.320]  to write about them um but if they break part of your like if i couldn't write articles if like
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:50.320]  bb edit didn't open in the beta that would be really bad and i would have to have like another
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:56.080]  system to use to write my article because uh you can't you know you you gotta use the beta stuff
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:44:03.680]  but you've also got to work so i've got uh i got catalina on an external drive but i'm as as we
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:10.480]  podcast talking to you from uh mojave because i'm not gonna pod right i'm not gonna risk that you
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:14.240]  did that you're like i'll be back in a minute i gotta reboot into mojave so we can do a podcast
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:24.960]  and i've got ios 13 or aka ipad uh os 13 running honest on my year-old iphone 10 and and okay a
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:32.240]  mac mini or ipad mini i mean right not your actual ios devices right but i'm thinking i the the one
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:37.280]  i'm i'm almost certainly going to upgrade first before we start our family vacations is i think
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:46.320]  i'm gonna put ipad os on on my main ipad because a i don't it if it gets buggy there's no scenario
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:51.120]  where that really adversely affects me i mean maybe there'd be a third-party app i don't know
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:58.000]  that that i would wish worked but didn't but it it's the device that i can get by with in bugginess
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:05.760]  the most um i like i i feel like uh you know i know they had this weird warning this year
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:10.080]  like they called it thrill seekers you know and they kind of made you jump through extra hoops
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:17.440]  to get the first betas of the ios you know you had to connect to xcode you couldn't just download a
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:24.160]  profile and restart and do a software update on the device you kind of had to use a mac
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:31.440]  i i i find that the on the iphone it's pretty stable i i i haven't really seen anything i
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:36.560]  i'm probably not going to put it on my main phone before we start going on vacations next month but
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:44.000]  it seems like i could i don't know yeah it's i mean it doesn't seem disastrous right like you
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:47.600]  always have to worry that the next beta will have a terrible bug and you'll update to that one and
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:52.720]  suddenly you'll be in trouble but they're they're thrill seeker warning really won't turn me off i
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:59.200]  was like holy shit this is this must be really buggy but it it seems usable what what are you
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:05.440]  thinking about dark mode on ios i am much more interested in dark mode on ios than i am on the
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:12.240]  mac to be honest like i tried dark mode in mahavi and it's a little bit better now that safari has
[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:16.880]  dark mode support and websites are sort of sort of starting to come around to the idea that you
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:25.120]  might want to build in a dark mode um the i wondered maybe daring fireball fireball needs
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:29.040]  like a light mode or something i don't know what happens then but you're already kind of doing dark
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:34.880]  mode so it's okay um but on on the ios devices especially like on the iphone like i already am
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:39.120]  using the dark interface in a lot of my apps because they look really good on the oled screen
[01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:47.360]  and um on the ipad somewhat too so i i feel like i'm probably gonna use dark mode a lot more on
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:54.720]  ios than on on mahavi but what about you i i think it it works better on ios so i think it's it's
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:59.840]  interesting like i was just saying to you earlier in the show where in years past and dark mode is
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:05.280]  a perfect example of this where it just seems like apple can't do it all at once you can't say okay
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:11.680]  all of our platforms now have dark mode it was you know dark mode's a perfect example where tv
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:19.520]  os had it and then mac got it and now ios gets it but it seems like ios is the platform where people
[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:25.200]  really wanted it i know people cheered for it with the mac but the cheers that it got in the
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:31.040]  keynote even though it was widely expected the rumors were super rampant that you know this is
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:35.920]  the year ios was going to get dark mode but man when when they when craig federighi announced it
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:42.400]  the crowd went nuts i mean that's it was absolutely bonkers i mean if if there was anything that
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:50.480]  competed with it was when they announced the ps4 controller for apple apple tv um i think it works
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:59.040]  so much better on ios than mac because of the fact that ios doesn't have a window windowing system
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:07.200]  it has this either full screen apps or tiled apps and the thing on the mac i i honestly
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:14.320]  i mean my eyes are bad and and weird in a bunch of ways but on the mac i honestly can't get how
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:19.120]  people run everything in dark mode i've been running bb edit in dark mode effectively dark
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:26.400]  mode for years like i have a dark background very dark gray with with light colored you know
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:34.480]  uh sure colors for the text and in recent years bb edit has detected that and if you have a dark
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:39.280]  theme it also shows you a dark interface whether you know even on older versions of mac os
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:48.320]  but having one app in dark mode to make it jump out on my screen full of tiled windows from a
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:54.480]  bunch of apps is different to me than having very different to me than having everything in dark
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:49:00.000]  mode and the way that you just don't see the three dimensionality in dark mode as well because
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:05.040]  it's tough because how do you show a shadow right like in in light mode on mac when you have one
[01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:11.600]  window in front of another the one that's in front casts a shadow behind it the fact that ios doesn't
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:17.040]  have to worry about that makes it work way better and there are some interesting touches that apple
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:23.440]  has done that as you go into a view hierarchy and and something pops up it gets a little bit lighter
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:29.200]  but because they don't overlap the way that windows on the mac by definition have to be
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:38.960]  able to overlap i think it works way better yeah yeah it's it's um i think there's context too like
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:44.960]  i'm i mean the fact is i use my mac mostly during the day and uh the brightness doesn't bother me
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:50.080]  and i i use my iphone often in darker circumstances and it's also got the oled screen
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:53.840]  i don't know i mean the nice thing about it it's personal preference honestly the safari thing for
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:59.440]  me is huge because apps have been updated to support dark themes but then you go to a web page
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:05.600]  and it just blasts you with white background and black text and it's terrible like enough for me
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:10.720]  to be like no no no i can't i can't look at the world this way and i'll just go back to the light
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:16.880]  theme on mahavi so it's it's getting better and i feel like once ios is supporting dark themes
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:20.480]  all the web developers are going to be like look we really need to do this because now everybody's
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:26.000]  using their iphone in dark mode yeah and it also i mean it's on windows i i don't know if it's
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.160]  currently on android but i have no doubt that they will support it as well it's and there are web
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:35.760]  standards to support it and that that's the thing is i think dark mode is good when everybody's on
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:39.680]  board with dark mode the problem is that if you have as long as you have outliers it's like it's
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:44.640]  just like oh this is terrible get me out of here and and so i haven't used it on my mac at all
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:53.680]  it's kind of interesting too though for me because i there are certain apps that have always been
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:59.920]  white background with colors in the front like messages i mean messages goes back to when it
[01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:05.840]  was called i chat right and has sort of had the same interface i mean the only the only big
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:14.000]  difference between today's messages and i chat from 20 years ago is that they don't use the aqua
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:22.000]  style the 3d bubble effect on the text bubbles right it's it's always been a light white
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:28.160]  background app mail has always been a white background app so looking at those apps when
[01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:34.880]  i'm running my iphone or the ipad in dark mode it at first it is just like bizarre it is like
[01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:39.440]  i can't believe that messages has a black background but it it doesn't take long to get
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:44.640]  used to it i i kind of like it and then with mail i realized that it really kind of harkens back to
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:49.840]  even earlier like go back to like the early 90s when i would connect to mail and it was always
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:55.200]  through a terminal window and it was a black background with white text it was like mail
[01:51:55.200 --> 01:52:03.200]  mail seems kind of natural with white text on a black background yeah yeah it's uh although even
[01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:07.680]  there like with mail there is html mail so you end up with those things where it looks yep it
[01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:12.400]  looks bad and then because it's mis-rendered and yeah yeah you're like going through messages like
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:17.760]  this one it looks good looks good and then you you pop one up that's like html formatted and it's
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:24.720]  white and it's like ah who invited you to this party this is this looks terrible yeah uh the
[01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:30.960]  other but there's other things though that i think are a little bit more complicated like i get it
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:37.280]  it's a weird feature in my opinion i mean like i said just a couple minutes ago the enthusiasm
[01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:45.120]  that people have for it is almost off the charts but there is something to be said for having a a
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:54.080]  a unified look the standard interface is a white background with black text and then sometimes
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:53:00.160]  we'll go to a black background with white text uh for certain contexts and it it informs you
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:08.480]  so the one that i that that bothers me in this regard is photos is the standard photos interface
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:13.920]  has always been a white background the and then you go into edit mode on a photo and it turns
[01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:20.160]  black and then you know you're in edit mode and now that we you can have a dark background at the
[01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:26.080]  beginning you kind of lose that instantaneous hey i know whether i'm in browse mode or edit mode
[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:32.160]  because whether the interface is white or black and i don't know what the solution to that is
[01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:39.120]  like i i kind of feel like that's a casualty of of supporting dark mode is that you kind of lose
[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:46.880]  this instantaneous hey you know this is a special mode where we switch to a black background you're
[01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:50.800]  right right because they there's that whenever you edit it it switches like that yeah i don't
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:55.600]  know and do you invert that i mean this is i joked about like creating the light mode version of
[01:53:55.600 --> 01:54:01.920]  daring fireball but i do think that is a legitimate question which is like um the i i was being snarky
[01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:07.120]  but i'm also kind of serious that when they went to logic pro 10 from logic pro version 9 they
[01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:12.560]  remade it from this kind of very gray platinum interface to an interface that's a dark interface
[01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:16.480]  and they said you know we have a lot of people working audio engineers working in windowless
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:21.680]  rooms and like it was too much it's like it was sort of the argument for dark mode but my question
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:27.040]  when they announced this last year was okay when can we expect a light mode for logic right because
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:33.120]  it's if you're letting me choose and your app currently is dark should you not now do a light
[01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:38.640]  version for me if i prefer light interfaces and i you know not a lot of people are paying attention
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:42.640]  to that but i think it's legitimate like what do you do when you edit a photo in photos now that
[01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:47.760]  you're in the dark mode how can you indicate and you've seen apple's written about it and developers
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:52.960]  have written about it the issues of like how do you differentiate a floating window when you
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:58.080]  used to differentiate it by casting a shadow but now there's nowhere to cast the shadow because
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:03.280]  it's dark like there are you know it's more complicated than you'd think to just go into dark
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:11.280]  mode yeah absolutely uh the one that i was very curious to see was the apple watch app on iphone
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:17.840]  which has always had a dark interface not quite black but that's why they don't call it black
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:23.120]  mode it's dark mode and i thought well what are they going to do with the apple watch interface
[01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:29.280]  is when you go into dark mode is the apple watch app going to go light because it's the the point
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:34.800]  is to make it the inverse of what's regular but instead it just stays dark it's like the
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:39.440]  apple watch app doesn't doesn't make any it doesn't make any difference whether your system
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:45.680]  is dark mode or not that's the answer that they came up with but it's still it it is that the
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:53.120]  right answer in a way it seems like it should it should be light right right right i mean i mean
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:58.000]  it's not always going to be that the right answer is the inverse but it's certainly like you have
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:01.280]  to every time you do something like this you have to ask yourself that question of like well what
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:06.880]  do i do here to indicate like with the drop shadow it's like you don't have to have a like a drop
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:12.720]  glow or something but you do need to invent some way to indicate that thing that you can't indicate
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:17.840]  anymore using the darkness because the darkness is now something else yeah i don't know i like it
[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:23.760]  more than i thought i would i i'm running it on my ipad with the setting to have it turn on
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:29.280]  automatically at night and so at night time it's dark and in the daytime it's day uh which i've
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:35.840]  actually been running on my apple tv for years i believe and on apple tv in particular i i go
[01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:41.280]  months with even forgetting that i have that set because it seems so natural for it to be light in
[01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:46.400]  the daytime and dark at night time on the iphone it's a little bit more glaring because you you
[01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:52.560]  can't miss it when you're in messages and it's a dark background but but i dig it i dig it more
[01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:57.920]  than i do on my mac i i really can't see using it system-wide on my mac but on the iphone i can
[01:56:57.920 --> 01:57:08.000]  definitely see it uh all right what else is on your agenda as a high level wwdc follow-up type
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:14.480]  thing we can talk about the mac pro and the pro display xdr yeah i mean it is i think they're
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:21.200]  worth talking about um although on one level i feel like giving them more oxygen just kind of
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:28.160]  like repeats the problem that we've had which is so much of attention is given to the mac pro
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:34.720]  and now to this display that is out of whack with how with with how many people will ever use them
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:39.120]  and this is not new that's the thing that gets me is it's like the the trash can mac pro it's
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:43.760]  been so long that people have forgotten apple strategy about the mac pro but like there is
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:51.520]  a real continuum from the time when most power users used a power mac and the time when most
[01:57:51.520 --> 01:57:58.240]  power users use an iMac the iMac used to be a consumer mac it is now a the mainstream mac and
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:02.240]  that you could start that continuum wherever you want when the g5 came out when the when the first
[01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:09.280]  mac pro came out but like apple has been gradually ratcheting up the power of their high-end system
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:16.080]  and making it further and further out of whack from what like any normal person would want
[01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:19.840]  because they only want to serve this little narrow group and it's very profitable but a
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:24.160]  very small niche they've been doing that for years now and i think the big change is that
[01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:28.960]  you know after the little uh digression with the trash can you know we're back to this new
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:33.360]  cheese grater and like there are the people out there who who really expected that this thing
[01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:38.400]  would start at two thousand dollars and that then you could build it up to what everybody else wants
[01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:46.000]  but the truth is to make the ultra high-end computer that some industries need you need
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:50.960]  to bake in a bunch of stuff that does not allow you to sell a two thousand dollar configuration
[01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:57.120]  and apple has so many macs already that fulfill the people who are down here maybe not in their
[01:58:57.120 --> 01:59:02.640]  desire to have slots or whatever it is that's motivating them but like uh you know that that
[01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:07.200]  is already fulfilled that they need to build this thing to fulfill the dreams of the people at the
[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:11.840]  at the real high end so i don't think it's a change in apple strategy at all but it's also
[01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:17.280]  funny because we all end up talking about it it becomes like a symbol of the platform even though
[01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:24.080]  it is going to be bought and used by the tiniest fraction of mac users and then the display by a
[01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:31.440]  tiny fraction of those people right it there is there is a part of me that recognizes that this
[01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:37.120]  whole thing like as we complain about it in the commentariat you know the apple commentariat class
[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:42.960]  that within apple there must be people who are like what can we do to please you people like
[01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:48.080]  you wanted us to make high-end mac hardware we've given you the highest end mac hardware we could
[01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:52.400]  even conceive of and now you're going to complain of course we're going to complain that's what we
[01:59:52.400 --> 02:00:01.680]  do but yeah um i it is i i think it's great overall and i'm so happy that this machine
[02:00:01.680 --> 02:00:10.560]  is so high-end because it it it it matches apple's rhetoric over the last two years ever since the
[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:16.080]  the sort of round table all right we're gonna admit we made a mistake with the trash can here's
[02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:23.920]  where we're going forward what they said matches what they've shipped since then the imac pro is
[02:00:23.920 --> 02:00:29.680]  truly a phenomenal computer and is almost certainly the pro computer for most people
[02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:37.360]  who want a pro desktop um the mac mini which they didn't even talk about in advance has seen
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:43.680]  a really serious upgrade and everybody who's interested in the mac mini seems very very happy
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:53.040]  with where it went last year from the base end configs to the higher end configs and the new mac
[02:00:53.040 --> 02:01:01.840]  pro is truly a workstation it is absolutely in that classic like silicon graphics sun you know
[02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:08.400]  from the 90s those companies unix workstation for true power users who really need the most
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:14.240]  computing that you can put underneath the desk it it truly is there they've pushed the state of the
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:22.960]  art in hardware engineering forward with the uh expansion capabilities and the modularity it's
[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:29.040]  really a fascinating device from a hardware's perspective but like you said it's it is not for
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:35.040]  most people it's absolutely not for me i'm fascinated by the device and it is it is the
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:40.480]  most interesting macintosh that i have no interest in buying whatsoever like it takes me back to like
[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:46.800]  like 1990 you know like 1991 like when i first went to school and or university and and had to
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:52.320]  get a mac and it was like there were the max that were possible that i would get and you know like
[02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:58.800]  the lc and the se 30 and then of course there was the two fx which is the one of course i wanted but
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:06.720]  it was like i think the back to fx retailed in 1990 and 91 for around like 15 16 000 and in there
[02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:13.440]  in 1990 dollars and that was not not for regular people there was one kid at drexel who had one he
[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:18.960]  had a two fx he was obviously came from a family with money and remember the game specter yeah
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:24.480]  yeah sure tank game yeah it was a 3d tank game and everybody who knew anything knew that you
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:31.440]  would put it in outline view instead of fully rasterizing the the panels because you'd get a
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:35.520]  higher frame rate and you know you have better network performance but the kid who had the two
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:42.160]  fx i forget his name but he was also a specter he cheated at specter he like used res edit to you
[02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:46.080]  you could use it to hack your specs you know it was like i think you had like a limit of
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:53.440]  you had like points to assign to like speed shields and firepower and so you you'd have
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:58.800]  to balance it and he like it was it was very clear that he had hacked his version he was a cheater
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:04.080]  which i mean why would you cheat you already have a two fx why would you yeah i always put a bad
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:10.640]  you're already winning yeah come on but uh you know i wanted a two fx i would have loved to if
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:16.400]  i had if money were no object as a freshman in college which is obviously an oxymoron i would
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:21.120]  have had one right i wanted a two fx it would have run specter better it would have run everything
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:27.120]  better at this point in my life i have no need for the current mac pro i mean it's just overkill for
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:35.200]  me i mean i'm still on a 2014 imac 5k which i never get slow for me if i got a new machine i'd
[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:41.040]  probably get the imac pro just because i love i love the design i can't see why i how i could
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:48.400]  possibly justify anything more than an imac pro um yeah i have the imac pro and i only justify it
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:52.720]  because i have all of these podcast audio files that i process using these kind of like high-end
[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:58.640]  plugins where it takes you know i'm i'm denoising four hours of audio for five people and it you
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:03.040]  know i was like oh that's actually enough reason for me to get an imac pro but even then i'm
[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:07.280]  pushing it and certainly the the mac pro there's there's no reason and that's okay and i think
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:14.560]  you know part of the psychology of fandom is why isn't this for me like the fans of anything i want
[02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:19.360]  everything to be and and you see it in weird ways like i was saying i was reading about how they're
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:24.400]  doing a couple of animated uh star trek shows and it's the first time since the 70s that they've
[02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:28.640]  done an animated star trek show when i was the target audience for that animated star trek show
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:34.640]  back in the 70s and i know there's an undercurrent of fans who are like why are they making a show
[02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:40.800]  for kids i'm not a kid and like i feel that way about uh apple fans to a certain degree too where
[02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:45.600]  there's this feeling of like outrage that the mac pro isn't designed for them and it's like it's not
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:49.840]  just like the macbook people were outraged about that 12-inch macbook because it wasn't powerful
[02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:55.120]  enough and it's like dude it's not for you right like my daughter has one and she loves it but
[02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:59.840]  it's not for everybody and that's okay but you know i i do think there's this feeling like well
[02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:06.640]  but i'm a power user i'm very serious the high-end mac pro should appeal to me and the truth is it
[02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:11.360]  it doesn't make sense for almost anybody and that's okay it's not meant to well and then
[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:18.800]  it's exacerbated by the pro display xdr yeah like i'm not you went in that room right like there's
[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:23.040]  that they they did a room across the street from the convention center where they had
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:29.520]  the they had uh it was a great it was like here is the 5k monitor that people buy here is this
[02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:35.040]  crazy like six thousand dollar monitor that people try to scrape by with that's the highest quality
[02:05:35.040 --> 02:05:41.360]  consumer monitor prosumer monitor then here's the pro display xdr and then here are these two sony
[02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:47.280]  uh reference monitors that cost between 32 and 38 thousand no more they were in the 40s they were
[02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:53.680]  like 42 and 48 it was a huge sum of money 48 and the one of them the one that was uh it was
[02:05:53.680 --> 02:05:59.360]  it the oled one or the non i think it was the oled one they've they've actually discontinued already
[02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:05.360]  right because it it it can light goes on if it's bright for too long it dims itself and the light
[02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:09.680]  goes on that says nope this is no longer a reference monitor yeah it gets it gets about
[02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:16.480]  90 seconds at full brightness and then it's an actual hardware light an amber led light on the
[02:06:16.480 --> 02:06:23.920]  display that comes on to warn you hey we've got i can't maintain reference mode any longer because
[02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:28.720]  i i'm too i'm i think i'm running too hot i'm too hot so i've reduced the knit so you can't really
[02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:34.400]  trust this so you you can really and i i asked i was like so it you know in in the real world
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:40.320]  of people who are like grading footage for like a theatrical movie release or like a high-end
[02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:45.120]  hbo show or something where the color really matters you can really only do like one shot at
[02:06:45.120 --> 02:06:51.840]  a time because you the light comes on and you you can no longer trust it and they're like yeah that's
[02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:59.760]  that that yeah and that's 48 000 it's absolutely insane it is sometimes apple does these rigs these
[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:03.840]  demo rooms up and and sometimes you you're like come on guys this is ridiculous and other times
[02:07:03.840 --> 02:07:08.880]  you're like you did a great job here and this was a great job because it was all about putting this
[02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:15.760]  thing in context and i wish other people could have seen this room because it was there's the
[02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:22.720]  fine 4k or 5k display it was garbage right like it was so terrible and then there was the six
[02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:28.800]  thousand dollar monitor it was a dell 4k display and it was truly terrible honestly makes you
[02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:33.120]  wonder it really makes you feel like they're they're just criminals for even selling it right
[02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:38.240]  for any you know probably the imac display isn't much better but it's probably better but oh yeah
[02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:43.680]  like i'd see i think that was the missing thing in that demo is that they should have had if they
[02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:50.080]  really wanted to be fair they would have put an imac 5k display right and that to me is ultimately
[02:07:50.080 --> 02:07:58.240]  what is missing in right apple's product line is why don't they sell the 5k imac display as a
[02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:03.840]  standalone display that i think that would have the two own goals really two ways that apple really
[02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:09.600]  kind of like did some bad pr one is one is they should not have priced the monitor without the
[02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:14.640]  stand i know you need i know it's a thousand dollars and you're going to get killed by it's
[02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:20.400]  just just price it this is you've already proven in that room that the six thousand dollar ref
[02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:25.680]  or not reference displays the six the display with the same price as yours is a joke compared to
[02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:30.560]  yours which is actually looks better in most circumstances to the forty thousand dollar
[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:37.040]  monitors you got us you got us just include the monitor and raise the price don't play and say
[02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:41.520]  that you can order it without if you want to save some money right by getting the visa mount version
[02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:46.480]  instead for cheaper that's all you need to do so that was own goal number one own goal number two
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:51.520]  is they're speaking as we said earlier in this in this show they're speaking to a developer
[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:56.160]  audience with a product that's not for a developer audience and the developers you know and the other
[02:08:56.160 --> 02:09:01.360]  and honestly what 90 of the people who buy a mac pro 70 of the people who buy a mac pro they don't
[02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:07.600]  need a reference monitor so why not come out with what everybody really wants which is something
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:12.000]  like the imac panel as a standalone for them and it will work with the mac mini it would work with
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:16.960]  the macbook pro work with the mac pro you can you can say you know we can argue about whether it
[02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:25.840]  should be a 6k 31 inch display like sure the xdr or whether it should literally just be the 27 inch
[02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:32.960]  5k panel that i'm looking at right now just put it in a standalone display i mean and i know on
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:39.600]  atp marco was even talking about it where they've gotten rid of the target mode for imax where you
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:45.600]  can just use an imac as a standalone display but you can get like the base model 5k imac is like
[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:52.240]  17 or 1800 something like that people would buy that if you could just plug the mac pro into it
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:58.560]  and you just have a a computer you don't use on the back of it you know but the fact that they
[02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:04.960]  don't have it is is a glaring absence that optimistically here's what i hope and i have no
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:11.200]  inside juice on this at all i'm not cheating i have no sources no little birdies all right my
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:17.280]  hope is that they called this six thousand dollar seven thousand dollar eight thousand dollar with a
[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:25.200]  stand display the pro display xdr as opposed to just calling it the pro display because they're
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:31.360]  going to have a pro display and the pro display or pro display hdr or hdr maybe right something
[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:38.240]  something else but the fact that it's not just the pro display and it is such a glaring hole in the
[02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:42.880]  lineup like there are like it's not even a hole in the lineup that's the amazing thing is if you
[02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:50.720]  look out there it's a hole in the market yes exactly there are no good retina 5k displays for
[02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:55.840]  max it's actually worse than it used to be because lg has discontinued the one that they had that
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:11:02.800]  they kind of made in cooperation so the market for 5k displays is actually worse than it was
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:10.080]  because lg has discontinued it and the only way to get the lg one which is okay uh is to get like
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:13.920]  find one that's like on the gray market because it's been discontinued maybe you have to get it
[02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:18.880]  used maybe somebody still has one still in stock but it's like you can't even get a new one the
[02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:26.800]  and the pc side of the market is just not in the ball game at all the 5k is just not a thing in
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:32.640]  windows world you're lucky if you can get 4k they're kind of crappy and the people who care
[02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:38.400]  the most about graphics are gamers and they don't want retina displays because they have to drive
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:43.280]  four times the pixels they'd rather have a non-retina display that's big and like wraps
[02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:51.440]  around their desk or whatever it the the market for displays has bifurcated between the mac and
[02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:58.880]  pc world in a way that hasn't happened since like the 80s you know when the mac was a a black and
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:05.040]  white interface and you know pcs had like vga color graphics it it's like a totally different
[02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:10.080]  universe so there is no way there's nobody to go to other than apple if apple doesn't make
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:18.400]  a 5k pro display nobody's going to and it's it's a device that wouldn't just be great for people who
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:24.480]  want to buy a mac pro who don't need a seven thousand dollar reference display it would also
[02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:33.520]  be great for mac mini users it would be great for and and to me the biggest market is the gazillion
[02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:40.560]  macbook users whether of any whatever macbook you have especially those macbook pros right but if
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:46.320]  you have a macbook pro and you do pro work and you want to plug it into a display at your desk
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:52.800]  to have a big display they're clearly especially the 15 inch but even that the current 13 inch has
[02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:58.800]  such powerful graphics they can easily drive a 5k display and if you're doing the sort of work that
[02:12:58.800 --> 02:13:04.480]  it would benefit from having a big display what are you supposed to buy to plug your computer into
[02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:12.240]  to me it is that coming out of wwdc it is the biggest hey apple you've done great work in the
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:16.480]  last couple of years you've really been listening to the pro market but here's the one thing you've
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:20.560]  got to do because if you don't do it nobody is going to do it yeah that and that's the key it's
[02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:25.280]  like i'm okay i'm okay with apple saying you know this market is served we don't need to be in it but
[02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:30.160]  the problem is that this market is now not really being served and that's a little bit like apple
[02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:35.120]  i'm okay with apple discontinuing the airport because other wi-fi systems are available but
[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:39.280]  imagine that there were no wi-fi powders other than airports and then they discontinued and
[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:44.960]  you're like wait a second wait a second i need my wi-fi and that's and again i understand that
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:48.800]  perhaps that product's not ready or they think it's better timed with a release if they do this
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:53.920]  like rumored 16 inch revised laptop thing wouldn't it be great to have an external monitor as part of
[02:13:53.920 --> 02:13:59.280]  that story i get it and yet at the same time this pro display xdr shown off in front of developers
[02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:06.000]  who don't want it it's like you could have avoided the controversy here if you had had another monitor
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:11.760]  that you pre-announced right but they didn't and one of the features that the that the pro display
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:18.240]  xdr has that they showed off is that you can rotate it to go from portrait yeah to land or
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:26.240]  landscape to portrait yeah which to me is a very developer friendly feature because developers
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:33.040]  write code and code scrolls up and down and it doesn't go horizontally it it's almost like
[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:38.000]  rubbing it in your face like wouldn't this be great as a developer to have this 6k display that
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:45.360]  you can rotate to go up and down so you can see more lines of code up and down uh you remember
[02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:53.920]  i'm sure you do the the radius uh radius full page display on i had one on uh at my desk at my
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:59.680]  college newspaper all of our page layouts we had one two-page display uh on a like a mac 2
[02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:05.200]  everything else was this portrait radius display where we did all of our page layout that's
[02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:11.040]  basically how i started using a mac i with one of those having a yeah back in that era in the early
[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:16.160]  90s having a display that went up and down was amazing john this is why i have those crazy ipad
[02:15:16.160 --> 02:15:22.080]  stands now it's because i can actually write on my ipad with an external keyboard and i can put it
[02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:31.280]  in portrait right it's great uh but to show that to developers and i know yoink so i really really
[02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:38.720]  hope it all makes sense if in the bag in their back pocket they've already been planning on a
[02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:44.320]  regular pro display that costs let's just say it costs a thousand dollars maybe it's fifteen
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:50.640]  hundred dollars because it comes with a five hundred the developers i talked to would be happy
[02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:58.720]  if they could pay the price of an imac 5k yeah just and just get the screen right if they have
[02:15:58.720 --> 02:16:03.200]  that in their back pocket and the only reason they didn't announce it is they would they want
[02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:09.760]  to save it for when the mac pro actually ships this fall right or when that new fancy new laptop
[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:14.560]  right comes out which might be the same at the same time right it could be the same event uh
[02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:18.960]  that would be great and then all will be forgiven and we'll be like ah we get it because we wanted
[02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:23.920]  to save some good news for when people could actually take out their credit cards and buy
[02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:30.160]  the thing and they're excited to do it but you also wanted to show off with this crazy it's
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:34.880]  worth fifty thousand dollars but we're selling it for six or seven thousand dollars pro display xdr
[02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:38.880]  okay that's the sad truth of the pro display xdr is that everybody's making a big deal about that
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:43.440]  thousand dollar stand and all of that this is a piece of extremely high-end equipment almost
[02:16:43.440 --> 02:16:50.480]  nobody will want and for the people who will want it it's such a deal it's actually a good value
[02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:55.040]  because they're gonna stop buying forty thousand i mean i feel i i don't really feel bad for sony
[02:16:55.040 --> 02:17:00.160]  but it's like you know sony is sitting there going oh no like we can't start we can't charge forty
[02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:05.440]  thousand dollars for a reference monitor anymore because apple's selling one that's basically as
[02:17:05.440 --> 02:17:10.400]  good for six grand like that's it's an amazing product it's amazing breakthrough it's actually
[02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:15.840]  in some ways it strikes me as being one of the more innovative uh breakthrough bits of hardware
[02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:21.680]  that apple has done in a while it's just in such an esoteric market that like you know when was
[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:27.440]  when was the last time we talked about reference monitors for pro video on your podcast never never
[02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:32.480]  never i didn't even know it was a limited thing yeah i didn't even know something yeah so it's
[02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:36.560]  it's it's brilliant it's just it's a product that nobody actually you know outside of this very
[02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:40.720]  small few want it's brilliant for those people but for the rest of us it's like where is my
[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:47.440]  5k or 6k display that i can put on my desk with my mac pro or macbook pro or or mac mini or whatever
[02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:55.360]  and it just takes us into the heart of being an in the apple ecosystem as a user is that you're
[02:17:55.360 --> 02:18:03.040]  you're implicitly explicitly really putting your faith in apple because nobody else can can do it
[02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:09.040]  if you're all in on ios you can't buy a tablet or a phone from another company right you can't
[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:13.920]  you can make a hackintosh so that you know the mac is a little different where you can unofficially
[02:18:13.920 --> 02:18:22.560]  create a hackintosh uh in a way that you can't even do as a as a hobbyist on on a phone but for
[02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:27.600]  the most part if you're in the mac ecosystem you're buying apple hardware and that gets to
[02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:32.640]  especially on laptops it gets to the whole debate we've been having over the last couple of years
[02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:39.120]  with the last you know modern revisions of the entire macbook lineup from the you know entry
[02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:45.440]  level to the pro models and the decisions they've made on ports and thickness and of course keyboards
[02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:52.080]  etc you know we're all in on this and if their keyboards don't work right you know you're getting
[02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:57.600]  a keyboard that doesn't work right because that's your only choice yeah it's great and and the
[02:18:57.600 --> 02:19:05.120]  bigger problem by far was the apparent hey they don't really have works clack work workstation
[02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:10.000]  class hardware anymore so if you want to do workstation class work on the mac you're kind
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:16.400]  of out of luck and they've solved it now they've got the imac pro and the mac pro and they're
[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:24.400]  truly truly scaled to phenomenal distances of technical i mean 1.5 terabytes of ram is crazy
[02:19:24.400 --> 02:19:28.800]  i mean that's like as far as i can tell that's going to cost at least like forty thousand dollars
[02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:33.360]  yeah maybe maybe more you may be you know i'm sure there will be a six-figure configuration
[02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:37.040]  of this right yeah i honestly think that you might be able to get like a hundred thousand
[02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:42.160]  dollar mac pro with if you max out all of the cores and all the ram and and the ssd storage
[02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:46.000]  it's insane but it's great that that exists because there's some people who are like yeah
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:50.800]  sign me up i need that you know i i actually have work that that that would justify it
[02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:57.840]  um but a lot of us want a lot of us want it very few of us need it right it's the truth of it but
[02:19:57.840 --> 02:20:03.760]  but we're to me the hole that is left in the lineup is so glaring at this 5k standalone
[02:20:03.760 --> 02:20:09.920]  display and nobody else is going to make it there's just no way i mean lg sort of had it
[02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:15.040]  and got out of the business so who else makes me wonder if if that is because apple used them as
[02:20:15.040 --> 02:20:18.640]  a partner and then remember they had the thing where like they were blocking the wi-fi and it
[02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:24.000]  wasn't all these bad things about it that they had to fix i wonder if when apple decided because
[02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:31.760]  that was at that event where i was told uh and and i think nile was told apple is like out of
[02:20:31.760 --> 02:20:35.440]  the display business yeah that's why we're showing you this lg display because we're not going to
[02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:42.960]  make displays anymore i wonder if lg's abandonment of that market is a sign that they know that apple
[02:20:42.960 --> 02:20:47.040]  is gonna do that product and they don't need to work with apple anymore apple doesn't need them
[02:20:47.040 --> 02:20:51.520]  anymore to or they soldier on with that product or they just need them as a component maker give us
[02:20:51.520 --> 02:20:56.080]  the panel right right right we're going to brand it as apple and put our secret sauce on it and
[02:20:56.080 --> 02:20:59.440]  improve the profit margin on it and that'll be great and we're just going to keep buying the
[02:20:59.440 --> 02:21:03.600]  panels from you maybe that's it i i actually this is why i'm kind of hopeful that'll happen is it's
[02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:07.520]  a product that needs to exist somebody's got to make it and the fact that lg is not making it
[02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:13.760]  feels a little like a timing thing where we're in transition to a new product and maybe that will
[02:21:13.760 --> 02:21:18.800]  be an actual apple labeled product that'd make john sarah kusa very happy yeah it definitely
[02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:26.240]  would and and and really like every developer who not just mac pro people but anybody who's got
[02:21:26.880 --> 02:21:33.040]  an imac or an imac pro or a macbook pro or i'll say it again that mac mini actually scales pretty
[02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:37.760]  well you can get a pretty powerful mac mini but then what do you attach it to right exactly right
[02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:42.160]  what do you what do you what do you buy tell me what tell me what to buy phil shiller tell me what
[02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:47.280]  monitor to hook this mac mini up to it's absolutely it's really you know just just shut up and and
[02:21:47.280 --> 02:21:52.640]  take my money is where we are with it uh and i'll just say this too i mean i didn't sit in front of
[02:21:52.640 --> 02:21:57.520]  the pro display xdr for an extended period of time it was all in the hands-on areas and and brief
[02:21:57.520 --> 02:22:03.120]  demos and stuff but a thousand nits is super bright i mean like you know like i think the
[02:22:03.120 --> 02:22:08.560]  imax uh are capped at 500 nits so about half the mac you know maximum brightness on a 5k
[02:22:08.560 --> 02:22:15.760]  the maximum brightness on an imac is just fine for normal use like if you're writing code or reading
[02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:23.280]  or whatever it's like it's not in the least bit dull or dim it's just that a thousand is insanely
[02:22:23.280 --> 02:22:30.800]  bright it is like put sunscreen on your face bright yeah it it is it is hilarious just how
[02:22:30.800 --> 02:22:33.920]  bright that monitor is and that was that was one of the things that came through in that
[02:22:33.920 --> 02:22:39.760]  sort of dim room with all the different monitors is is this is not like i don't even run my imac
[02:22:39.760 --> 02:22:43.680]  at full brightness no i don't either i'm looking at it right now and it's like yeah i don't even
[02:22:43.680 --> 02:22:49.440]  have this on full brightness it's bright enough anyway i hopefully fingers crossed apple knows
[02:22:49.440 --> 02:22:53.440]  what they're doing and they're just saving a little bit of ammunition to have uh something
[02:22:53.440 --> 02:22:58.960]  nice to announce in the fall and if not uh hopefully they'll listen to the show and
[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:06.720]  get started or at least at least turn the imac at least let a regular imac be a standalone display
[02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:12.000]  and just let people buy it and let the the computer part of it go to waste and just use it
[02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:20.880]  as a display it it's almost baffling that that this product doesn't exist yep how many times
[02:23:20.880 --> 02:23:26.640]  did you get asked i got asked you know like you know like friends and family like family people
[02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:30.960]  who know oh you go out to california every june for this apple thing and they you know they don't
[02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:37.360]  read my website they just know vaguely what i do and the one thing they wanted to talk about was
[02:23:37.360 --> 02:23:45.280]  the thousand dollar monitor arm yeah yeah i didn't get i didn't get much i mean so here for me it was
[02:23:45.280 --> 02:23:50.320]  my son said oh they made that they made that um stand that cost a thousand dollars because
[02:23:50.320 --> 02:23:55.120]  obviously he saw a youtuber who was making jokes about it and i was like yeah well it's complicated
[02:23:55.120 --> 02:23:59.440]  and it's not for but i'm like yeah i mean and that's to me is the sign that you just made a
[02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:04.880]  major pr fumble is that nobody remembers anything but this this thing that you did that you totally
[02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:10.000]  didn't need to do but that's that's how it is so yeah for me it was not my relatives so much as my
[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:14.880]  as my son who's on this totally other because because julian and jonas are about the same age
[02:24:14.880 --> 02:24:20.080]  and they they obviously get all of their information from youtube all of it 100 of his
[02:24:20.080 --> 02:24:25.920]  information about the world comes from youtube did you see the side by side of the matte finish i
[02:24:25.920 --> 02:24:31.200]  know they're not calling it matt they're calling it the nano nano etched nano etched whatever but
[02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:39.040]  let's just say matt and glossy did you get to see them side by side i did the matt is so nice
[02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:45.440]  i just i actually just wrote a piece that i turned in this morning for tom's guide because i'm
[02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:49.440]  writing about iphones over there every other week or something like that and um for phil michaels
[02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:55.440]  my old pal from macworld who's at tom's guide now and uh this piece was like what hardware now that
[02:24:55.440 --> 02:25:02.720]  now that iphone rumors go out to 2020 yeah which is ridiculous to fall of 2020 right um what hardware
[02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:07.840]  where should apple steer in terms of like hardware innovation what are the places that it feels like
[02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:13.040]  there's room for them to push and one of the things i wrote was you know still a lot of glare
[02:25:13.040 --> 02:25:19.680]  on these on these iphone and ipad screens and i wonder like this this nano etch stuff i like i
[02:25:19.680 --> 02:25:23.920]  get that you're shooting a laser to make little things in class and i get that it's not a touch
[02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:30.640]  screen and it doesn't have to have the you know kind of unbreakability that gorilla glass needs
[02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:37.920]  and yet part of me is like can you talk to corning about the lasers for the laser etched glass because
[02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:43.520]  i would really love it if my ipad and my iphone were not glarey like they are that would be really
[02:25:43.520 --> 02:25:48.160]  nice when you i would i i would like it on my macbook too especially yeah oh for sure i feel
[02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:51.680]  like with for sure with the handheld ones you can at least tilt them a little whereas the macbook
[02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:58.240]  you sort of prop it up on whatever table you're in front of and the angle sort of defines itself
[02:25:58.240 --> 02:26:02.960]  you don't really right and ever ever since apple put that single pane of glass in front of the
[02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:07.280]  display on the macbook uh the glare has been pretty you know it's way more severe than it
[02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:11.040]  used to be so yeah i that's that's one of these things that i have in the back of my mind again
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:16.000]  it's like i'm not gonna buy the six thousand dollar monitor but that technology and i get
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:21.840]  that it added a thousand dollars to the price of the monitor but that technology is really
[02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:27.280]  interesting because it's like you know who are they working with on the glass what is this process
[02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:31.520]  and does it have applications elsewhere in the product line because like wouldn't it be great
[02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:37.920]  if you could get maybe not for a thousand dollars but you could get a true matt uh macbook screen
[02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:44.720]  that was not and just a coating and maybe it's like a 300 upgrade you know right right you know
[02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:51.360]  given the size of a macbook screen to the size of the uh pro display xdr screen i i would pay
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:58.480]  300 in an instant heartbeat for that just for that finish because it is so nice it is it is
[02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:05.760]  truly remarkable and it is by definition unphotographable there is no way that you can
[02:27:06.800 --> 02:27:12.560]  it's by definition you can't really show the difference other than seeing it in person side
[02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:17.440]  by side and yeah the way i describe it is sort of like if you stand off access from it you can
[02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:24.640]  see people's faces reflected in the in the the non-glare one or in the glare one and in the
[02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:29.280]  non-glare one it's like they're vampires they're just gone yeah oh there's no reflection on that
[02:27:29.280 --> 02:27:34.640]  screen that that was what did it for me yeah there there was some weird lighting they held a bunch of
[02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:40.400]  the briefings i'm sure you were at some of them in the marriott hotel adjacent to the convention
[02:27:40.400 --> 02:27:44.880]  center and those sure the the meeting rooms that they have there have very strange lighting
[02:27:44.880 --> 02:27:52.000]  uh sort of like an 80s futuristic lighting on the ceiling but with these very
[02:27:53.440 --> 02:27:59.280]  long and prominent lighting fixtures in a square pattern on the roof and right on the ceiling i
[02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:04.720]  mean and you that to me was the test it was like on the glary one on the regular one you could
[02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:09.520]  easily see those white lines of the lights and then you'd go right next to the next one and
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:13.600]  you'd expect to see it continue right across from the one display to the other and it just
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:21.200]  disappeared it wasn't like oh there's less glare there was none none at all unbelievable uh so
[02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:25.040]  you think of it as a thousand dollar finish you think wow that's pretty expensive but when you
[02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:31.040]  think of it as going from six thousand to seven thousand and it's only a sixteen percent increase
[02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:34.800]  you're like oh for sixteen percent more i would definitely i would get that in a heartbeat i
[02:28:34.800 --> 02:28:40.160]  almost it's so much nicer that it almost makes me wonder why they even offer the one without it
[02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:45.200]  like why not just say here it is it everyone has the matt finish and it's seven thousand dollars
[02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:49.520]  i had that same thought because it goes back to the stand too it's like look everybody's
[02:28:49.520 --> 02:28:54.480]  going to get the stand and the and you make a mounting option just roll in the price of the
[02:28:54.480 --> 02:28:59.840]  stand roll in the price of the of the match right and just say it's an eight thousand dollars
[02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:04.880]  eight thousand dollars it's the best display anybody's ever made in the world and in small
[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:10.240]  print oh if you want to save a thousand dollars you can omit the stand yeah sure anything else
[02:29:10.240 --> 02:29:15.760]  jump out at you i know we've been going on for a while we're always going on i mean for me for me
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:22.800]  the ipad just ipad os not just the name which is like it's interesting too because it is a
[02:29:22.800 --> 02:29:28.080]  marketing name you brought this up at the talk show with with craig and jaws like is a name is
[02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:33.680]  always marketing like you could argue that like watch os is kind of ios tv os is kind of ios but
[02:29:33.680 --> 02:29:38.960]  what they've decided to do is brand them based on the device because the idea there is it's the
[02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:45.920]  device that runs the object and ipad os is really just sort of saying you know we have features here
[02:29:45.920 --> 02:29:51.840]  at apple that we build for ipad users and you use them as an ipad user and i like that i also feel
[02:29:51.840 --> 02:29:57.280]  it gives them less place to hide next year if they try to withhold ipad features every other year like
[02:29:57.280 --> 02:30:02.560]  they've done the past few years that like now we're going to be like well what about ipad os
[02:30:02.560 --> 02:30:08.320]  and and there's a question there and like you know even like tim cook had to do a few slides about
[02:30:08.320 --> 02:30:12.960]  tv os at the keynote right like he had to it was obligatory because tv os is a product in their
[02:30:12.960 --> 02:30:16.880]  lineup they have to talk about it but it was telling that it was the only platform where he
[02:30:16.880 --> 02:30:21.440]  didn't call anybody else out like he went through it so fast that instead of calling you know eddie
[02:30:21.440 --> 02:30:25.840]  q or somebody used to come up and talk about it tim was like i'll do this myself and then my
[02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:29.920]  feeling was like hey you're the apple or you're the tv os product manager it's like well i got
[02:30:29.920 --> 02:30:35.040]  good news for you tim cook is going to read your slides personally but the bad news is that you're
[02:30:35.040 --> 02:30:38.960]  not important enough to have somebody else come out you you will be sitting in the audience for
[02:30:38.960 --> 02:30:44.400]  this presentation but yeah i i just think as an ipad user i i essentially i'm a mac user at my
[02:30:44.400 --> 02:30:50.000]  desk and i am an ipad user when i'm not at my desk i don't really use a macbook my family has them
[02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:56.080]  i have an old macbook here that i i use occasionally but i basically use an ipad when i'm traveling or
[02:30:56.080 --> 02:31:00.880]  even just sort of out in the house or in the backyard or whatever and so for me this is that
[02:31:00.880 --> 02:31:06.000]  year where we got lots of good ipad features which is great now i hope i hope now that the
[02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:11.040]  name is out there we continue to get them every year but there's a lot of good stuff in there
[02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:17.520]  it's a you know it's a work in progress we'll see what they do in the in the betas the complication
[02:31:17.520 --> 02:31:25.520]  of making multi-window ipad apps is i mean that's such a hard thing to get right and parts of it
[02:31:25.520 --> 02:31:31.920]  work like magic and other parts of it are a little bit baffling yes i mean you know you brought up
[02:31:31.920 --> 02:31:36.240]  like you tap on the notes app and it shows you it's expose and it shows you all of your open
[02:31:36.240 --> 02:31:42.240]  windows for notes that's great but if you alt or you know command tab into notes it just kind of
[02:31:42.240 --> 02:31:48.320]  goes to one of them yeah and which one is it and that may just be a bug they may fix that but it's
[02:31:48.320 --> 02:31:53.440]  one of those cases where like it's still trying to navigate like what's a window how is it like
[02:31:53.440 --> 02:31:58.080]  an app how is it not like an app but i'll tell you it is uh you know there's a whole litany of
[02:31:58.080 --> 02:32:02.080]  things that's just like computers have had for so long and that for some reason technical or
[02:32:02.080 --> 02:32:07.280]  political the ipad has refused that with this release they're like yeah okay you can you can
[02:32:07.280 --> 02:32:13.040]  plug in usb drives you can mount smb servers you can open multiple windows you can open multiple
[02:32:13.040 --> 02:32:16.800]  documents in an app so you can have two word documents open side by side if you want we'll
[02:32:16.800 --> 02:32:21.040]  let you do that well that's really that's awful nice of you yeah since i've had that on my mac
[02:32:21.040 --> 02:32:27.360]  for 25 30 years that we finally get that or even longer we finally get that on the ipad but i'm
[02:32:27.360 --> 02:32:31.600]  glad they're there right like it was it was a joke that they hadn't been there already but at least
[02:32:31.600 --> 02:32:37.520]  they're there now command tab is interesting and you know let's give credit to microsoft for
[02:32:37.520 --> 02:32:43.120]  inventing command tab back in the day you know it's for sure certainly something that the apple
[02:32:43.120 --> 02:32:50.080]  you know took from windows and added to the mac uh i was talking about it at wwdc with some people
[02:32:50.080 --> 02:32:54.640]  we were trying to remember what the names of the utilities were but like before apple officially
[02:32:54.640 --> 02:33:00.000]  supported command tab on the mac there were a couple of popular third-party mac utilities that
[02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:07.840]  that offered it um it it's a great idea i don't know you know it it's so
[02:33:09.360 --> 02:33:14.800]  innate to my muscle memory that i kind of can't remember not having it but i do remember
[02:33:14.800 --> 02:33:22.480]  i know that for years i used a mac without it and it works great in the mac interface
[02:33:22.480 --> 02:33:27.200]  it just is per you know you command tab it shows a list of all your running apps when you select
[02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:34.320]  one all of the windows for that app come forward but maintain their relative indexes to each other
[02:33:35.120 --> 02:33:42.800]  uh it it does what you expect it is it it's just part of my brain but on the ipad to me
[02:33:42.800 --> 02:33:48.320]  it's never sat right at least since it's like i i don't know when they first supported it maybe
[02:33:48.320 --> 02:33:53.040]  they've had it all along because remember they had a keyboard with the original uh yeah i think
[02:33:53.040 --> 02:34:00.400]  it's been there for a long time and maybe forever yeah it only to me on the ipad works when you're
[02:34:00.400 --> 02:34:07.520]  using the ipad in the iphone sense of each app gets the whole screen and once you go split
[02:34:07.520 --> 02:34:14.320]  screen on ipad the command tab interface to me completely breaks down it it's a it's a mismatch
[02:34:14.320 --> 02:34:21.360]  of ui metaphors and the fact that you can't command tab to some places is just bizarre
[02:34:21.360 --> 02:34:25.680]  right like and it's been that way where there's also like apps that um i don't know if this is
[02:34:25.680 --> 02:34:32.560]  true in 13 but in ios 12 um they're depending on how an app gets open like if an app gets opened
[02:34:32.560 --> 02:34:37.040]  by another app it doesn't show up at the command tab switcher which is like what is that about but
[02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:43.440]  that's and i always view that as a bug but it's a really bad weird bug and now i think this is
[02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:50.000]  the question is shouldn't should the command tab switcher uh trigger an expose kind of thing i
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:54.480]  think you've got multiple windows i think yeah whether it should be the expose that you get as
[02:34:54.480 --> 02:35:00.240]  you drag up from the bottom of the ipad screen or whether they redo the expose so that there can be
[02:35:00.800 --> 02:35:06.880]  one unified switching interface i on i feel very strongly that the single thing that ipad os needs
[02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:14.720]  the most is a unification of command tab switching versus swipe up switching because when you swipe
[02:35:14.720 --> 02:35:23.040]  up everything makes visual sense you can see oh i have notes paired with messages here in a space
[02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:29.760]  and i have notes a different note but the same app notes paired with safari over here that's the one
[02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:35.360]  i want and i can tap it and it brings it comes forward whereas when you do the command tab thing
[02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:39.600]  and you go to notes and it doesn't bring up the one you want and there's no other option it it
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:44.320]  just feels broken i feel like that that's a hole in the interface that they they should fix but
[02:35:44.320 --> 02:35:51.840]  but overall i think that the the way that they've expanded the multi-panel interface for ipad os
[02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:59.200]  is really really clever and i really think it's especially i think for people who like you who
[02:35:59.200 --> 02:36:05.680]  that's your primary port or your only portable machine being able to do two up is to me magical
[02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:10.480]  i brought that up at my talk show but two is the magic number where it's like you have old and new
[02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:16.960]  left and right and if you can look at two notes at the same time or two word documents or google
[02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:23.680]  documents using the ipad desktop browsing or whatever sure uh two up is is magical and being
[02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:30.160]  able to do that is is a huge huge win slide over which was really just kind of like a remnant of
[02:36:30.160 --> 02:36:34.880]  the original concept and it was always a little bit weird and kind of hard to get rid of and hard
[02:36:34.880 --> 02:36:41.600]  to manage it's actually gone to be what they've done with that is turn it into an iphone basically
[02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:47.040]  which is brilliant so yeah the now it's going to be much more useful because now the slide over
[02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:50.880]  thing you know you you sort of slide it out and it's a floating window above your content
[02:36:50.880 --> 02:36:56.800]  but you can swipe on the bottom like you can on the bottom of an iphone 10 and it'll just go
[02:36:56.800 --> 02:37:01.280]  through all of your different apps and windows that are there or you can swipe up and get
[02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:06.480]  a little multitasking app switcher just for slide over and so now slide over is no longer this kind
[02:37:06.480 --> 02:37:15.280]  of like app in a box off on the side it's now like a access quick access to any app you want
[02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:21.760]  for a moment which like i feel like it's way more powerful a concept now than it was before and
[02:37:21.760 --> 02:37:26.160]  i actually think i will use it in a way that i just never bothered with with the old one because
[02:37:26.160 --> 02:37:32.880]  now it's just so easy to just get at anything for a moment do what you need to and then flip it away
[02:37:32.880 --> 02:37:37.840]  and that's uh that's a good concept i like that i yeah and i i do this i'll but i wonder if you
[02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:42.560]  do too but i'll do this where i'm working on my ipad and sometimes even my mac too but i'll take
[02:37:42.560 --> 02:37:48.240]  out my phone and do something on my phone literally my actual phone just because i know
[02:37:48.240 --> 02:37:54.080]  it's brief and i know that like some of the continuity features are so great that i can
[02:37:54.080 --> 02:38:00.800]  count on it like let's say i know that i saw a tweet from jason snell and he had a link that
[02:38:00.800 --> 02:38:06.720]  i definitely want to get on my mac somehow i'll just go to my phone and there it is because i
[02:38:06.720 --> 02:38:12.240]  left tweetbot there and i can copy it and copy it from my phone and then just switch to my mac and
[02:38:12.240 --> 02:38:17.280]  paste and continuity will make you know give me the thing i just copied on the other device i feel
[02:38:17.280 --> 02:38:22.000]  like you can use slide over like that now like it's sort of like having a like you said like
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:27.600]  having an iphone on your ipad screen just for like a one-off you know get this thing and then
[02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:32.480]  get rid of it yeah yeah and you can if it's not the app the big frustration before was like it's
[02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:35.920]  not the app that you want then it's this whole thing where you're going through and like trying
[02:38:35.920 --> 02:38:39.600]  to find what app you want to drop there and now you just flip through them until you find the
[02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:45.120]  thing you want and then grab it and then flip it away and that's it it's uh i think it's a good
[02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:50.320]  i i'm impressed with how they really rethought the slide over thing is like what do we do with slide
[02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:53.760]  over to make it better and the answer was we're going to take and this may not have been an
[02:38:53.760 --> 02:38:59.520]  accident it may have been part of the big picture even last year but whoever said oh our method of
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:06.800]  navigating you know in a iphone 10 is the same method we should use for slide over it's like yes
[02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:12.400]  good job whoever thought of that because it's exactly right i i i feel like it's a little bit
[02:39:12.400 --> 02:39:17.360]  of column a a little bit of column b but i kind of feel like it's not it's it's a little bit more
[02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:24.480]  by design i really think that the the sort of rethinking that they went into for the iphone 10
[02:39:25.520 --> 02:39:30.720]  let's get rid of the home button and and make everybody use a gestural thing
[02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:38.800]  i think that was thought through to how would this grow to bigger devices or to something like uh
[02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:45.360]  sure the ipad is a bigger device but what if you have an iphone style window on that bigger device
[02:39:45.360 --> 02:39:51.440]  right yeah it does feel like they uh you know you do you make some decisions because of expediency
[02:39:51.440 --> 02:39:55.520]  and you have to get there and then at some point you need to revisit and say can we coordinate all
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:40:00.000]  this so it makes sense in a bunch of different places and that's what they did yeah and the other
[02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:03.680]  area and and it's funny that you brought that up because i was thinking about is one of my
[02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:09.280]  things i thought about at wwdc when i saw this interface was the other thing that really makes
[02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:19.200]  a lot of sense on the ipad and not on the iphone is um that only having one home button really
[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:24.480]  hurt the ipad with trying to have two apps on the screen at a time right because what is what is the
[02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:30.080]  home button controlling the left one the right one who knows now both of them have a little home
[02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:36.400]  switcher that you can that you can trigger it feels way more natural if if if you're thinking
[02:40:36.400 --> 02:40:41.040]  hey i should be able to have two apps on screen two different apps or maybe the two instances of
[02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:47.520]  the same app on screen at a time shouldn't they both have a home button and because now that now
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:55.760]  they can and it didn't really make sense before right uh anything else what else are you thinking
[02:40:55.760 --> 02:41:01.600]  about that was that for me that was the that was the the big the biggest news was just uh beyond
[02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:07.440]  the catalyst swift ui stuff and the mac pro was just that the ipad got some love which i am always
[02:41:07.440 --> 02:41:12.320]  happy to see i can plug in you know what i did this morning john for the very first time i plugged
[02:41:12.320 --> 02:41:18.080]  a usb-c thumb drive into my ipad and it just showed up in the files app i should not be as
[02:41:18.080 --> 02:41:25.360]  happy about that as i am finally uh you know i talked about that with uh the guys at my show
[02:41:25.360 --> 02:41:31.120]  with craig and jaws and i feel like craig kind of joked his way out of that i forget exactly
[02:41:31.120 --> 02:41:36.480]  what he said but it's a bigger technical underpinning and i think i'm almost convinced
[02:41:36.480 --> 02:41:43.920]  it's tied to the mac change where kernel extensions now can be run in user space instead of in the
[02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:49.040]  kernel memory space like i think that that's part of what they're doing on the ipad where
[02:41:49.040 --> 02:41:55.600]  the usb stack that that allows these drives to run is not running in kernel space it's a brand
[02:41:55.600 --> 02:42:02.000]  new usb stack i feel like maybe that was too technical and they didn't want to spill the beans
[02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:05.920]  on it he did mention security issues and whenever i've written about it people said well you could
[02:42:05.920 --> 02:42:10.160]  have a bad usb stick and my thought has always been what i know but i need to do my work too
[02:42:10.160 --> 02:42:16.960]  i will say this though and it it's a thing to watch for on the mac side is you know now on ios
[02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:21.360]  you can plug in a usb drive and use it and then you just unplug it when you're done right that
[02:42:21.360 --> 02:42:27.280]  needs to happen on the mac it is how many times do i mount something on my mac and then i unmount it
[02:42:27.280 --> 02:42:33.440]  and it goes away in the finder and then i unplug it and it says no i wasn't done like why do i have
[02:42:33.440 --> 02:42:40.000]  to do that come on right i i that feels old so i'm ready i'm ready for the moment where i can just
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:45.200]  unplug the device and it does the system does the right thing yeah that would be great but the ipad
[02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:50.480]  does that now so that's that's great i'm very glad that they did it i get and this is a recurring
[02:42:50.480 --> 02:42:55.360]  theme a lot of people are like oh why is apple so slow with some of these features when going back
[02:42:55.360 --> 02:42:59.440]  to that thing about everything's about privacy and security like some of these things they're
[02:42:59.440 --> 02:43:04.320]  like well if we're going to implement it we need to do it right which means we need to do it
[02:43:04.320 --> 02:43:10.240]  securely and we need to invent a whole new thing in order to have this thing work securely and
[02:43:10.240 --> 02:43:15.920]  that's i think why some of these features just don't happen is because um it's not that they
[02:43:15.920 --> 02:43:23.120]  couldn't mount usb in files it's because they were concerned about that as an attack vector
[02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:29.280]  probably already given that you could attach um usb devices for importing of videos and and photos
[02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:34.160]  into the photos app and we're like it's on our list is to do that in a more secure way and then
[02:43:34.160 --> 02:43:38.400]  we can roll it into files and it would not surprise me at all if that's exactly what what happened
[02:43:38.400 --> 02:43:41.920]  this year yeah i'm pretty sure it is and i feel like they didn't want to talk about it because
[02:43:41.920 --> 02:43:46.080]  they just don't they don't want to make excuses for themselves and so right they didn't really
[02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:51.360]  want to be mysterious right right it's like well you'll get it when we're ready and and that's it
[02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:56.800]  it is true it is it is a very funny thing to be very excited about but just plugging a usb drive
[02:43:56.800 --> 02:44:02.000]  into your i know i feel bad and i i mounted my uh my neck mini as an smb server and files and i was
[02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:06.320]  excited about that too and i'm like what is wrong with me these are just these are basic things but
[02:44:06.320 --> 02:44:13.280]  when you go without water for enough days you are desperate for water so there we are jason
[02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:18.400]  snell thank you very much uh i'm gonna emphasize again uh i think you guys even have another
[02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:24.160]  episode out i think upgrade 250 is already out yeah upgrade 249 is the one where you interview
[02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:32.080]  uh wiley hodges and josh shaffer uh which i i honestly i don't mince words here must listen
[02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:38.240]  interview in terms of understanding the scope of swift ui it it it's just tremendous well thank
[02:44:38.240 --> 02:44:44.480]  you uh you've got at least 60 other podcasts you do every week that's pretty much much true
[02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:50.800]  incomparable uh where i've been on a couple times we talked about 2001 yeah sometime in the last
[02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:55.520]  year uh yeah yeah we got and we and we got a couple others in there with you on them which
[02:44:55.520 --> 02:44:59.520]  which are nice we're gonna have to do that again sometime but that's yeah that's the pop culture
[02:44:59.520 --> 02:45:06.080]  thing and uh actually one i wanted to mention is i do a podcast at the end of every week with tv
[02:45:06.080 --> 02:45:10.480]  with it's called tv talk machine it's with tim goodman who is the tv critic at the hollywood
[02:45:10.480 --> 02:45:15.280]  reporter and we spend a lot of time talking about not just like new tv shows but we do spend a lot
[02:45:15.280 --> 02:45:21.040]  of time talking about kind of the weird landscape of the television industry now mostly disrupted
[02:45:21.040 --> 02:45:27.440]  by technology companies like apple and the advent of streaming services like netflix and prime video
[02:45:27.440 --> 02:45:33.520]  and that's a fun uh fun podcast if you care about sort of like tv and the future of entertainment
[02:45:33.520 --> 02:45:38.160]  we spend a lot of time where do people go to get this to get this podcast go to the incomparable
[02:45:38.160 --> 02:45:42.640]  dot com um and you can see a list of all the podcasts and and the incomparable is there and
