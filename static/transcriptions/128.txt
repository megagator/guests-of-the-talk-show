[00:00.000 --> 00:02.300]  Did you watch the Yankees last night?
[00:02.300 --> 00:03.640]  I didn't, I didn't.
[00:03.640 --> 00:05.680]  I was busy last night, my daughter's sick,
[00:05.680 --> 00:07.280]  so I was taking care of her.
[00:07.280 --> 00:08.560]  Oh, no, that's terrible.
[00:08.560 --> 00:09.980]  Yeah, just a little bit of a cough,
[00:09.980 --> 00:12.720]  kind of borderline croup kind of thing.
[00:12.720 --> 00:14.180]  So, I was thinking it was three,
[00:14.180 --> 00:16.800]  so that happens, I guess, around that age.
[00:16.800 --> 00:19.720]  Yeah, that's sort of like when they get adventurous.
[00:19.720 --> 00:21.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:21.000 --> 00:22.140]  Start touching a lot of things,
[00:22.140 --> 00:23.400]  putting a lot of things in their mouth,
[00:23.400 --> 00:25.520]  and what's this?
[00:25.520 --> 00:27.640]  Well, and it's like they're always
[00:27.640 --> 00:28.520]  putting things in their mouth,
[00:28.520 --> 00:32.580]  but it's like at three they can find amazing new places
[00:32.580 --> 00:34.520]  to go to put things in their mouth.
[00:34.520 --> 00:36.400]  Right, exactly, exactly.
[00:36.400 --> 00:38.600]  They have, they're ambulatory,
[00:38.600 --> 00:42.320]  and they can climb now, and yeah, exactly.
[00:42.320 --> 00:43.720]  It's like they first start moving around,
[00:43.720 --> 00:46.900]  and you can just sort of clean up a room,
[00:46.900 --> 00:48.920]  and have a room where everything within reach
[00:48.920 --> 00:52.820]  is reasonably clean, and then that's good.
[00:52.820 --> 00:53.920]  And then by the time they're three,
[00:53.920 --> 00:55.240]  they can get anywhere.
[00:55.240 --> 00:57.760]  Yeah, yeah, either you go full clean room,
[00:57.760 --> 01:00.000]  where it's just bare walls to the ceiling,
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.880]  or you just kind of have to roll with the punches.
[01:04.520 --> 01:06.400]  Oh, man, so it's weird.
[01:06.400 --> 01:08.580]  I feel like there's a weird combination.
[01:08.580 --> 01:10.980]  August is always a weird time in every industry,
[01:10.980 --> 01:13.840]  but in tech in particular,
[01:13.840 --> 01:17.120]  it's always slow in some ways,
[01:17.120 --> 01:19.920]  but I feel like this year it's interesting
[01:19.920 --> 01:20.980]  in a couple of ways.
[01:23.500 --> 01:25.080]  Well, and one, and I just saw it,
[01:25.080 --> 01:28.480]  now it's right up, I'm sure you saw the article,
[01:28.480 --> 01:30.040]  because I saw it on TechCrunch,
[01:30.960 --> 01:34.600]  is that all the drama at Twitter, more or less.
[01:34.600 --> 01:36.340]  Oh, right.
[01:36.340 --> 01:39.320]  As we record today, August 7th,
[01:40.280 --> 01:42.660]  the news today is that Chris Sacca,
[01:43.800 --> 01:47.060]  ooh, what do they call him, outspoken investor.
[01:48.200 --> 01:49.240]  It's fair.
[01:49.240 --> 01:50.080]  Yeah, I think it is.
[01:50.080 --> 01:51.440]  So I think it's a fair characterization.
[01:51.440 --> 01:53.600]  I doubt he'd balk too much at that.
[01:53.600 --> 01:55.320]  I don't want to put words into his mouth,
[01:55.320 --> 01:58.460]  but he seems to have no qualms in kind of saying
[01:58.460 --> 02:00.580]  what he believes is the right thing to do there.
[02:00.580 --> 02:03.560]  I would also say it would be fair to describe him
[02:03.560 --> 02:06.980]  as influential investor Chris Sacca.
[02:10.080 --> 02:14.640]  He's sort of, maybe like in tech,
[02:14.640 --> 02:17.640]  he's sort of like the nice guy version of ICANN.
[02:21.160 --> 02:23.400]  Yeah, I was gonna say Carl Icahn, yeah.
[02:23.400 --> 02:27.160]  Yeah, I mean, Icahn is sort of a bulldozer.
[02:27.160 --> 02:29.640]  I think Sacca tries to talk to the right people
[02:29.640 --> 02:31.160]  and say, look, these are the things,
[02:31.160 --> 02:33.220]  and connect the right people that are whatever.
[02:33.220 --> 02:34.600]  I mean, you notice that this is the first time
[02:34.600 --> 02:36.400]  he's really kind of come out,
[02:36.400 --> 02:39.640]  I mean, obviously, he's said a lot about Twitter product,
[02:39.640 --> 02:42.120]  and he's written medium posts about Twitter product
[02:42.120 --> 02:43.960]  and all that stuff that he thinks that
[02:43.960 --> 02:45.680]  there are certain things they need to do with their product,
[02:45.680 --> 02:47.760]  which is fine, everybody has opinions.
[02:47.760 --> 02:50.240]  And he's known the product for a long time.
[02:50.240 --> 02:51.560]  But this is the first time he's come out
[02:51.560 --> 02:54.480]  and explicitly said, look, you guys should hire Jack
[02:54.480 --> 02:56.200]  for the CEO spot.
[02:56.200 --> 02:59.280]  And I think he does work a lot behind the scenes
[02:59.280 --> 03:00.960]  to kind of connect the dots
[03:00.960 --> 03:03.920]  and try to get the right things to happen with Twitter,
[03:03.920 --> 03:05.000]  because he really cares about it.
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.640]  But this is the first time he's actually kind of come out
[03:07.640 --> 03:10.660]  and said in public on Twitter,
[03:10.660 --> 03:12.260]  hey, you guys should hire Jack.
[03:14.420 --> 03:18.360]  And it seems like there's,
[03:18.360 --> 03:23.040]  the whole Twitter CEO thing is such a soap opera.
[03:23.040 --> 03:26.280]  I mean, you really could not write
[03:26.280 --> 03:28.560]  a more soap opera style story,
[03:28.560 --> 03:30.600]  because like a real soap opera,
[03:30.600 --> 03:32.180]  the characters don't go away.
[03:32.180 --> 03:37.180]  Like, they've gone through, they've gone through
[03:38.160 --> 03:42.520]  a bunch of CEOs, and everybody who has ever been
[03:42.520 --> 03:46.840]  the Twitter CEO remains on the board, right?
[03:46.840 --> 03:49.640]  Yeah, exactly, and they come back from like,
[03:49.640 --> 03:51.160]  oh, no, they weren't dead.
[03:51.160 --> 03:54.320]  They were in the basement strapped to a gurney,
[03:54.320 --> 03:56.240]  and a doctor was experimenting on them,
[03:56.240 --> 03:58.320]  and now your cousin is back,
[03:58.320 --> 04:00.520]  and he's in love with you or whatever, yeah.
[04:01.680 --> 04:06.680]  So you've always got these former co-founders
[04:08.720 --> 04:11.600]  and CEOs on the board looking over your shoulder.
[04:11.600 --> 04:16.600]  I mean, even with Dick Costello,
[04:16.600 --> 04:20.840]  he's, I guess he is no longer the CEO,
[04:20.840 --> 04:23.780]  but he's, you go right to the board.
[04:23.780 --> 04:25.120]  Yeah, he's on the board.
[04:26.320 --> 04:29.560]  I mean, I think that Twitter has a unique history
[04:29.560 --> 04:33.200]  in that a lot of the people that were really invested in it
[04:33.200 --> 04:36.400]  were not, they were not brought on
[04:36.400 --> 04:38.040]  because they were business people,
[04:38.040 --> 04:39.480]  because there's this sort of,
[04:39.480 --> 04:42.860]  there's this two-fold way of thinking
[04:42.860 --> 04:44.780]  about leadership in the valley,
[04:44.780 --> 04:46.680]  and depending on the investor,
[04:46.680 --> 04:49.000]  depending on the stage of the company,
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.360]  a lot of other things, you get varying opinions
[04:51.360 --> 04:52.480]  about what's the right thing to do
[04:52.480 --> 04:53.960]  as far as leadership goes,
[04:53.960 --> 04:58.960]  but there's a huge sort of cadre of people in the valley
[04:59.040 --> 05:01.440]  that follow and really closely adhere
[05:01.440 --> 05:06.240]  to this technical founder leadership mentality, right?
[05:06.240 --> 05:08.080]  Like the person that came up with the idea
[05:08.080 --> 05:10.840]  and maybe even wrote some code on the original concept
[05:10.840 --> 05:15.640]  or even crafted the first MVP product
[05:15.640 --> 05:17.080]  is the person that should lead the company
[05:17.080 --> 05:18.020]  because they know it the best.
[05:18.020 --> 05:22.800]  They know the underlying sort of purpose
[05:22.800 --> 05:24.160]  that they saw behind it,
[05:24.160 --> 05:25.640]  and they can guide that purpose
[05:25.640 --> 05:28.000]  through whatever permutations may come
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.080]  if they're in that leadership position.
[05:30.080 --> 05:33.340]  Whereas outside the valley, and even in the valley,
[05:33.340 --> 05:36.880]  there's some folks who are kind of coming around
[05:36.880 --> 05:37.900]  to this type of mentality,
[05:37.900 --> 05:38.920]  but outside the valley,
[05:38.920 --> 05:41.120]  you often see somebody being brought in purely
[05:41.120 --> 05:43.040]  because they're a good CEO.
[05:43.040 --> 05:45.720]  Like they have no idea what the technical aspects
[05:45.720 --> 05:48.880]  of the product entail, maybe even at first.
[05:48.880 --> 05:51.140]  They may not even use it.
[05:51.140 --> 05:53.920]  They may barely know to exist tangentially
[05:53.920 --> 05:56.600]  until the CEO search starts happening or whatever,
[05:56.600 --> 05:59.760]  but then they get brought in because they're a good CEO.
[05:59.760 --> 06:01.260]  It's like a good cleanup hitter.
[06:01.260 --> 06:02.760]  You know, you don't bring them in
[06:02.760 --> 06:05.960]  for their fielding prowess necessarily,
[06:05.960 --> 06:08.280]  but you're gonna bring them in to bat
[06:08.280 --> 06:10.080]  at the end of the order, or in the middle of the order
[06:10.080 --> 06:12.880]  to bring them back to home base.
[06:12.880 --> 06:14.240]  That's their skill.
[06:14.240 --> 06:16.280]  They don't have the other skills.
[06:16.280 --> 06:19.680]  Eric Schmidt might be a canonical example of that
[06:19.680 --> 06:23.880]  in terms of why did Google bring him in
[06:25.080 --> 06:26.080]  for when they did?
[06:27.200 --> 06:30.000]  What was Eric Schmidt's talent?
[06:30.000 --> 06:35.000]  I think bottom line that he was seen as being a good CEO,
[06:35.200 --> 06:37.640]  and that that's what Google at the time needed.
[06:37.640 --> 06:42.640]  And it's hard to, if you wanna take that stance,
[06:42.800 --> 06:45.000]  it's hard to argue against that.
[06:45.000 --> 06:47.920]  Whatever you think of Eric Schmidt and Google,
[06:47.920 --> 06:50.340]  they certainly were very successful under him,
[06:50.340 --> 06:52.440]  and it seems to have worked well for them.
[06:53.480 --> 06:55.120]  Yeah, I mean, I think that Larry,
[06:55.120 --> 06:56.720]  obviously taking the job back over,
[06:56.720 --> 07:00.160]  a lot of people saw that as a sort of reclamation
[07:00.160 --> 07:03.160]  and resurrection of some Google missions.
[07:03.160 --> 07:06.960]  As you'll notice that a lot of the experimental programs
[07:06.960 --> 07:10.280]  really took on a new life and were spun up
[07:10.280 --> 07:11.520]  after that happened.
[07:12.820 --> 07:16.720]  I think that there is something to be said for both.
[07:16.720 --> 07:20.140]  I think that getting your financial underpinnings in order
[07:20.140 --> 07:22.680]  and your business plans aligned with the stuff
[07:22.680 --> 07:25.100]  that's gonna help you grow and spend money in the long run
[07:25.100 --> 07:25.940]  is a huge thing.
[07:25.940 --> 07:27.620]  Like with Google, there's essentially two ways
[07:27.620 --> 07:28.560]  to think about it.
[07:28.560 --> 07:31.000]  You think about Google in the terms of way it makes money,
[07:31.000 --> 07:32.560]  which is actually quite boring.
[07:32.560 --> 07:34.260]  Well, boring to me, but not to some,
[07:34.260 --> 07:35.800]  some ad tech people might take offense and be like,
[07:35.800 --> 07:38.280]  no, they're doing all kinds of cool stuff, and that's fine.
[07:38.280 --> 07:40.360]  But it's fairly straightforward.
[07:40.360 --> 07:42.320]  The way they make money is ads.
[07:42.320 --> 07:44.680]  But the way they spend their money is fascinating.
[07:44.680 --> 07:46.840]  It's endlessly fascinating to me.
[07:46.840 --> 07:49.440]  And so that is like kind of the dual role
[07:49.440 --> 07:51.560]  that those two CEOs played, I think.
[07:51.560 --> 07:53.960]  Yeah, and I think the other factor there though
[07:53.960 --> 07:58.260]  is that there was never any kind of drama or contention,
[07:58.260 --> 07:59.600]  or at least from the outside,
[07:59.600 --> 08:00.960]  it certainly didn't seem like there was
[08:00.960 --> 08:04.480]  between Larry and Sergey and Eric Schmidt.
[08:04.480 --> 08:07.320]  It was a, that they were seen as three guys
[08:07.320 --> 08:08.360]  who led the company.
[08:09.680 --> 08:12.200]  And the fact that they brought in a CEO
[08:12.200 --> 08:14.520]  didn't really steer the company away
[08:14.520 --> 08:17.280]  from what it was founded to do.
[08:18.520 --> 08:20.400]  And that those guys were still there
[08:20.400 --> 08:22.880]  and were obviously heavily influential
[08:22.880 --> 08:25.840]  throughout the whole period where Eric Schmidt was the CEO,
[08:25.840 --> 08:27.840]  and obviously even more influential now
[08:27.840 --> 08:30.460]  that Larry is the CEO.
[08:30.460 --> 08:34.180]  But, you know, so I think you could see Google
[08:34.180 --> 08:37.340]  sort of almost like both sides of the argument,
[08:37.340 --> 08:39.500]  that they did well by bringing in a CEO,
[08:39.500 --> 08:43.020]  but that they also did well by keeping the founders there
[08:43.020 --> 08:46.860]  in significant leadership positions.
[08:46.860 --> 08:49.100]  Mm-hmm, yeah, I agree, I agree.
[08:49.100 --> 08:52.740]  And Twitter doesn't necessarily have that history.
[08:52.740 --> 08:54.420]  It has this kind of weird history
[08:54.420 --> 08:56.260]  where they bring people in.
[08:56.260 --> 09:00.020]  There's sort of internal contentions
[09:00.020 --> 09:03.780]  and fights about who really should be in charge
[09:03.780 --> 09:06.340]  regardless of who actually holds the CEO spot.
[09:06.340 --> 09:08.060]  Well, there's even contention at Twitter
[09:08.060 --> 09:11.260]  over who the actual founder is, you know?
[09:11.260 --> 09:15.540]  Was it Jack Dorsey who, or Evan Williams, you know?
[09:15.540 --> 09:18.500]  And I, you know, what's his name?
[09:18.500 --> 09:21.860]  Nick, what's his name?
[09:21.860 --> 09:23.940]  Bilton wrote a whole book, you know,
[09:23.940 --> 09:27.100]  about the trying to settle that argument.
[09:27.100 --> 09:30.620]  Right, and I think that, this is a good tie-in
[09:30.620 --> 09:33.140]  to that whole, you know, what do you do,
[09:33.140 --> 09:34.980]  who do you bring in to run a company thing,
[09:34.980 --> 09:36.780]  like the founder, the technical founder,
[09:36.780 --> 09:38.860]  or person who knows how to run the business.
[09:38.860 --> 09:40.740]  And I think that there's something,
[09:40.740 --> 09:41.660]  there's an alignment there,
[09:41.660 --> 09:44.380]  because part of Bilton's book,
[09:44.380 --> 09:47.460]  and this is a good thing that he pointed out
[09:47.460 --> 09:50.500]  that I think more people should understand about the valley,
[09:50.500 --> 09:54.220]  is that there's this myth of the sole creator, right?
[09:54.220 --> 09:56.420]  Of the mythical creator.
[09:56.420 --> 09:58.180]  And that's not unique to the valley.
[09:58.180 --> 10:00.300]  I think that a lot of companies have had this history,
[10:00.300 --> 10:02.860]  especially in America, where we kind of value
[10:02.860 --> 10:05.020]  this sort of like entrepreneurial spirit,
[10:05.020 --> 10:06.900]  and the I found, I made this thing
[10:06.900 --> 10:08.260]  with my hands kind of thing.
[10:08.260 --> 10:11.460]  And so you get this creator myth spun up,
[10:11.460 --> 10:16.460]  where the story becomes less and less complex over time
[10:16.620 --> 10:19.300]  until eventually it's this guy made this thing.
[10:19.300 --> 10:21.060]  But in reality, if you burrow down
[10:21.060 --> 10:22.540]  to the roots of the thing,
[10:22.540 --> 10:26.780]  it's these 12 people made this thing in varying ways.
[10:26.780 --> 10:28.700]  This person was an influencer.
[10:28.700 --> 10:31.660]  This person said no to the very thing
[10:31.660 --> 10:35.500]  that would have made it great, and whatever, right?
[10:35.500 --> 10:37.980]  You can burrow down to all the little teeny decisions
[10:37.980 --> 10:39.100]  that were made in the origin.
[10:39.100 --> 10:42.860]  But it's very, very rare to actually have
[10:42.860 --> 10:46.780]  a sole creator myth pan out if you burrow down
[10:46.780 --> 10:48.860]  to the origins of most of these companies.
[10:48.860 --> 10:50.660]  And I think Twitter is one of those things
[10:50.660 --> 10:52.180]  where you had people,
[10:52.180 --> 10:53.940]  it was such a nebulous start
[10:53.940 --> 10:56.820]  because it was a side project of another company,
[10:56.820 --> 10:59.060]  which was itself kind of flailing
[10:59.060 --> 11:02.340]  and deciding what it wanted to do and all this stuff.
[11:02.340 --> 11:04.540]  And then you had, on top of that,
[11:04.540 --> 11:06.020]  you have egos and you have people
[11:06.020 --> 11:08.460]  who are obviously incredibly talented,
[11:08.460 --> 11:12.900]  but also eloquent and have a passion for it.
[11:12.900 --> 11:16.700]  And it wasn't just a, oh, who made it so who gets the equity?
[11:16.700 --> 11:20.180]  It was who made it so who gets to own the creator myth?
[11:20.180 --> 11:22.660]  And I think that's almost as important as any other currency
[11:22.660 --> 11:26.300]  in Silicon Valley, because it funds future ventures
[11:26.300 --> 11:29.060]  and your ability to get funding for future companies
[11:29.060 --> 11:29.900]  and that sort of thing.
[11:29.900 --> 11:31.860]  So I think that Jack kind of came out the winner there
[11:31.860 --> 11:34.780]  for a time, although people have acknowledged
[11:34.780 --> 11:37.620]  Ev's efforts more and more as time goes on.
[11:37.620 --> 11:38.900]  And of course there are plenty of people,
[11:38.900 --> 11:43.660]  I mean, people forget, Costolo has been there 10 years.
[11:43.660 --> 11:46.220]  You know, it's just not a guy
[11:46.220 --> 11:47.860]  who kind of came out of nowhere.
[11:47.860 --> 11:49.580]  And I think that there is a big difference
[11:49.580 --> 11:52.140]  between, I think he got short shrift a lot.
[11:52.140 --> 11:55.100]  And I think he was kind of handed a bag of bones
[11:55.100 --> 11:58.580]  and asked to do things that weren't necessarily possible.
[11:58.580 --> 12:01.620]  I am not claiming insider knowledge on any of this.
[12:01.620 --> 12:03.820]  I just, you know, observation and discussion
[12:03.820 --> 12:06.300]  with people and all this stuff over time.
[12:06.300 --> 12:09.940]  It seems like, you know, nobody ever told me,
[12:09.940 --> 12:11.100]  oh, Dick Costolo is a jerk
[12:11.100 --> 12:13.100]  or Dick Costolo doesn't know what he's doing.
[12:13.100 --> 12:14.860]  Like, I never ever heard that
[12:14.860 --> 12:16.820]  in my history of reporting on Twitter.
[12:16.820 --> 12:20.820]  It was, you know, oh, the product is all over the place
[12:20.820 --> 12:21.820]  and they can't decide what to do
[12:21.820 --> 12:23.180]  and this and that and the other thing.
[12:23.180 --> 12:25.020]  Which there's a variety of things
[12:25.020 --> 12:27.460]  that could be a reason for that, but yeah.
[12:27.460 --> 12:30.900]  I always come back to, I just really think
[12:30.900 --> 12:35.540]  that there's a history, and it's natural,
[12:35.540 --> 12:36.940]  I don't even know how it could be avoided,
[12:36.940 --> 12:39.780]  but that with investors,
[12:39.780 --> 12:44.780]  when some company has unbelievable success,
[12:44.780 --> 12:47.660]  I mean, just, you know, like if you got in,
[12:47.660 --> 12:49.740]  you know, boom, that you've, you know,
[12:49.740 --> 12:52.860]  the stock explodes and you make tons of money
[12:53.860 --> 12:57.460]  and the company starts, you know, making enormous profits
[12:57.460 --> 12:59.580]  and it's, you know, hurrahs all around,
[12:59.580 --> 13:02.100]  that investors see, want to look for somebody else
[13:02.100 --> 13:03.660]  and say you should do what they did.
[13:03.660 --> 13:04.940]  And, you know, I always, you know,
[13:04.940 --> 13:07.540]  Apple's a company that I, you know,
[13:07.540 --> 13:09.300]  am intimately familiar with.
[13:09.300 --> 13:12.780]  And that to me was 20 years ago,
[13:12.780 --> 13:15.300]  this whole argument of you got to stop,
[13:15.300 --> 13:16.620]  you got to get out of the hardware game,
[13:16.620 --> 13:19.260]  you're a software company, you should license your OS.
[13:20.220 --> 13:21.580]  Because, you know, which was more or less,
[13:21.580 --> 13:23.020]  you should just do what Microsoft does
[13:23.020 --> 13:27.020]  because Microsoft was extraordinarily successful.
[13:27.020 --> 13:29.260]  A paragon of virtue at that time.
[13:29.260 --> 13:31.980]  Right, and it was too late at a certain point
[13:31.980 --> 13:33.060]  from an investor standpoint,
[13:33.060 --> 13:35.340]  it was too late to make lots of money on Microsoft
[13:35.340 --> 13:36.940]  because they'd already gotten huge.
[13:36.940 --> 13:39.220]  So why not, you know, get into Apple
[13:39.220 --> 13:40.580]  and have Apple do what they did?
[13:40.580 --> 13:42.180]  Even though that doesn't make any sense,
[13:42.180 --> 13:45.820]  it would not make any sense for, you know,
[13:45.820 --> 13:47.340]  doing what these people were saying
[13:47.340 --> 13:50.060]  wouldn't actually lead to the result of Apple
[13:50.060 --> 13:55.060]  having become a Microsoft-style success.
[13:55.260 --> 13:57.380]  And in fact, when they dipped their toes in it,
[13:57.380 --> 14:00.300]  it was a disaster with the cloning and licensing
[14:00.300 --> 14:01.980]  and stuff like that.
[14:01.980 --> 14:04.420]  It made a bad situation worse.
[14:05.780 --> 14:06.980]  Because that's what they wanted to do.
[14:06.980 --> 14:09.180]  And to me, that's, anyway, where I'm going with that
[14:09.180 --> 14:12.540]  is to me, Twitter is Apple and Facebook is Microsoft
[14:12.540 --> 14:13.460]  in that argument today.
[14:13.460 --> 14:14.980]  Oh, right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:14.980 --> 14:16.940]  No, I definitely think you're right there.
[14:16.940 --> 14:18.180]  I mean, I think there's plenty of people
[14:18.180 --> 14:19.620]  that are looking at,
[14:19.620 --> 14:24.060]  and both companies have made feints towards duplicating
[14:24.060 --> 14:26.460]  and or cloning certain features of each other.
[14:26.460 --> 14:28.820]  And for the most part, those don't pan out well
[14:28.820 --> 14:31.500]  because they don't align, you know, with the company,
[14:31.500 --> 14:33.260]  the core of what the company is.
[14:33.260 --> 14:36.100]  Oh, me, I'll text you this, you can pull it up,
[14:36.100 --> 14:37.780]  but there's this Dilbert cartoon
[14:37.780 --> 14:41.980]  that, excuse me, I got a little bit of a cough,
[14:41.980 --> 14:45.860]  I apologize, but that I found tweeted into my feed
[14:46.740 --> 14:49.380]  that it was so germane to this.
[14:49.380 --> 14:53.740]  It's from 2012, but the first panel, it's the boss.
[14:53.740 --> 14:56.060]  You got Dilbert and the dog and the boss, right?
[14:56.060 --> 14:57.460]  And the dog is the consultant.
[14:57.460 --> 14:59.940]  And the boss says, I hired a management consultant
[14:59.940 --> 15:00.780]  to teach us something.
[15:00.780 --> 15:02.820]  He calls backwards causation.
[15:02.820 --> 15:04.340]  And Dilbert's sitting there looking at him.
[15:04.340 --> 15:07.300]  And the second panel, the dog is the consultant always.
[15:07.300 --> 15:09.380]  Says, I studied the most successful companies.
[15:09.380 --> 15:13.860]  If you imitate them, you'll feel as if you have a strategy.
[15:13.860 --> 15:16.260]  And he's all, number one, sponsor a golf tournament
[15:16.260 --> 15:18.820]  so your CEO can meet celebrities.
[15:18.820 --> 15:21.180]  And the boss is all profits, here we come.
[15:21.180 --> 15:24.860]  And that like, yeah, it's just the funniest side,
[15:24.860 --> 15:26.420]  but it really is so true.
[15:26.420 --> 15:28.740]  You get a lot of these things where people go,
[15:28.740 --> 15:31.420]  this was successful, so you should imitate this.
[15:31.420 --> 15:35.300]  And they don't ask, you know, why was it successful?
[15:35.300 --> 15:39.100]  Or why was it successful in that particular area?
[15:39.100 --> 15:40.460]  And I think that's a big thing.
[15:40.460 --> 15:41.300]  It's a good comic.
[15:41.300 --> 15:43.460]  The third panel is obviously the joke,
[15:43.460 --> 15:44.300]  and it is kind of funny,
[15:44.300 --> 15:47.140]  but it's the second panel that sets up the joke
[15:47.140 --> 15:50.140]  that's actually sort of the insight
[15:50.140 --> 15:54.780]  into the bad strategy of a lot of companies, right?
[15:54.780 --> 15:56.100]  Because it's true.
[15:56.100 --> 15:58.060]  It's funny because it's true.
[15:58.060 --> 16:00.820]  If you imitate them, you'll feel as if you have a strategy.
[16:00.820 --> 16:01.900]  Right.
[16:01.900 --> 16:04.580]  It's much easier than doing the hard thinking
[16:04.580 --> 16:07.340]  about what the soul of your company is
[16:07.340 --> 16:11.540]  and how to expand that goal without giving up that soul.
[16:11.540 --> 16:14.380]  That's a much, much more difficult conversation to have
[16:14.380 --> 16:16.380]  than, you know, this was really cool.
[16:16.380 --> 16:18.420]  Why don't we test that out?
[16:18.420 --> 16:20.100]  A-B test it, see if it works.
[16:20.100 --> 16:21.300]  And if it works, great.
[16:21.300 --> 16:22.780]  If it doesn't, we'll just try something
[16:22.780 --> 16:24.100]  that some other company did.
[16:24.100 --> 16:27.700]  This to me is the bad hand that Dick Costello was dealt
[16:27.700 --> 16:28.540]  when he took over.
[16:28.540 --> 16:30.860]  It was that he was coming into a world
[16:30.860 --> 16:35.140]  where Facebook was heading towards an IPO.
[16:35.140 --> 16:38.700]  Their IPO was successful.
[16:38.700 --> 16:43.300]  They have done a tremendous job, this is Facebook,
[16:43.300 --> 16:47.180]  tremendous job pivoting to go from being a web company
[16:47.180 --> 16:51.260]  to a mobile company, including not just with usage,
[16:51.260 --> 16:52.860]  including making money.
[16:52.860 --> 16:56.460]  They're, I think they're, you probably know,
[16:56.460 --> 16:58.500]  almost certain though, I just read that they now make
[16:58.500 --> 17:02.140]  more money on mobile than they do from desktop.
[17:02.140 --> 17:03.340]  I believe so, yes.
[17:03.340 --> 17:04.500]  Don't quote me, but I believe so.
[17:04.500 --> 17:06.020]  If not, it's a huge amount.
[17:06.020 --> 17:08.260]  And they turned it around like overnight,
[17:08.260 --> 17:10.580]  not overnight, but really quickly.
[17:10.580 --> 17:12.420]  If they haven't quite passed it yet,
[17:12.420 --> 17:15.220]  the trend lines are clear that it either just happened
[17:15.220 --> 17:16.580]  early, you know, like in the last quarter
[17:16.580 --> 17:17.700]  or it's going to happen.
[17:17.700 --> 17:20.100]  The trend line is absolutely set,
[17:20.100 --> 17:22.460]  that they're going to make more money on mobile,
[17:22.460 --> 17:25.500]  which is exactly, makes sense because people
[17:25.500 --> 17:27.340]  are using mobile more.
[17:27.340 --> 17:28.180]  So it makes sense.
[17:28.180 --> 17:32.340]  So they've done great and they have this unbelievable
[17:32.340 --> 17:35.220]  size of users, you know, they've got, I don't know,
[17:35.220 --> 17:37.460]  over a billion active users around the world
[17:37.460 --> 17:38.300]  and it's growing.
[17:38.300 --> 17:43.220]  65%, by the way, 65% or 66% of their total revenue
[17:43.220 --> 17:45.900]  from mobile as of late last year.
[17:45.900 --> 17:47.380]  So far past.
[17:47.380 --> 17:49.940]  And it's going to keep going, I think.
[17:49.940 --> 17:52.660]  I think it's going to go up to 70, 75, 80.
[17:54.900 --> 17:57.260]  You know, unbelievable user base, lots of profits.
[17:57.260 --> 18:00.060]  It's not even, you know, like, oh, you know,
[18:00.060 --> 18:01.780]  hopefully, you know, they've got all the users
[18:01.780 --> 18:02.860]  and they've got all the revenue.
[18:02.860 --> 18:03.980]  Eventually they'll make a profit.
[18:03.980 --> 18:05.100]  No, they've already got the profit.
[18:05.100 --> 18:06.140]  It's a great business.
[18:07.060 --> 18:10.580]  And Twitter came of age in the shadow of Facebook
[18:10.580 --> 18:13.180]  and, you know, everybody made out with Facebook
[18:13.180 --> 18:15.500]  and then Twitter is sort of like Facebook
[18:15.500 --> 18:16.780]  in a general sense.
[18:16.780 --> 18:19.340]  It's a social network, right?
[18:19.340 --> 18:21.180]  It's, you know.
[18:21.180 --> 18:23.700]  Yeah, one could argue that it's actually a different thing.
[18:23.700 --> 18:25.020]  Oh, I think you definitely could.
[18:25.020 --> 18:27.700]  But yeah, it falls in that bucket.
[18:27.700 --> 18:30.980]  You know, it's certainly more similar than, you know.
[18:30.980 --> 18:32.500]  You could say it's apples and oranges
[18:32.500 --> 18:35.980]  but it's not like comparing apples to, you know,
[18:35.980 --> 18:36.940]  a paintbrush.
[18:36.940 --> 18:39.420]  You know, they're clearly, you know,
[18:39.420 --> 18:41.780]  they're in the same section of the grocery store.
[18:43.580 --> 18:46.420]  And, you know, and so therefore it was,
[18:46.420 --> 18:50.020]  well, Twitter should be as successful measured
[18:50.020 --> 18:53.700]  in those ways, you know, stock price, revenue, profits,
[18:53.700 --> 18:55.780]  users, active users as Facebook.
[18:55.780 --> 19:00.420]  And I think the fundamental truth is that Facebook,
[19:00.420 --> 19:04.260]  the nature of Facebook is more compelling to more people,
[19:04.260 --> 19:06.380]  just regular people, than Twitter.
[19:06.380 --> 19:08.660]  I think Twitter is a phenomenal idea.
[19:08.660 --> 19:11.460]  I honestly, to me, it has changed my life.
[19:11.460 --> 19:14.500]  I honestly cannot, can't even imagine.
[19:15.500 --> 19:17.300]  It's hard for me to remember, you know,
[19:17.300 --> 19:18.660]  what it was like before Twitter.
[19:18.660 --> 19:20.660]  And to me, it's always very funny to think about it
[19:20.660 --> 19:24.260]  because it, Twitter and the iPhone more or less came out
[19:24.260 --> 19:25.220]  around the same time.
[19:25.220 --> 19:27.940]  Like I signed up for Twitter in late 2006
[19:27.940 --> 19:31.420]  and really kind of, you know, dug into it throughout 2007,
[19:31.420 --> 19:33.500]  which was the year the iPhone came out.
[19:33.500 --> 19:37.900]  And so it's, you know, my life pre-2007, I remember it,
[19:37.900 --> 19:39.340]  but it seems, it seems-
[19:39.340 --> 19:41.380]  You don't have a log of it for sure, right?
[19:41.380 --> 19:44.100]  It seems unimaginable though, it really does.
[19:44.100 --> 19:46.780]  Even just how I did during Fireball seems very strange
[19:46.780 --> 19:51.220]  to me because an enormous part of writing during Fireball
[19:51.220 --> 19:53.780]  to me is what I do on my iPhone.
[19:53.780 --> 19:55.900]  And a lot of what I do on my iPhone is Twitter
[19:55.900 --> 19:58.940]  in terms of just finding links and getting feedback
[19:58.940 --> 20:00.380]  and stuff like that.
[20:01.740 --> 20:03.180]  I think it's a tremendous product.
[20:03.180 --> 20:05.180]  I just don't think, I think fundamentally though,
[20:05.180 --> 20:09.820]  it's not as compelling to the mass market as Facebook.
[20:09.820 --> 20:14.340]  And yet the demand was there from investors for it to be.
[20:14.340 --> 20:19.340]  And they've twisted and contorted it to sort of make it
[20:20.220 --> 20:22.660]  as Facebooky as they can while still being true
[20:22.660 --> 20:23.500]  to what Twitter is.
[20:23.500 --> 20:25.500]  And it, to me, it's just, they've just perverted
[20:25.500 --> 20:28.020]  what Twitter should be.
[20:28.020 --> 20:30.460]  Yeah, I mean, I think there's a couple of ways
[20:30.460 --> 20:31.300]  to look at that.
[20:31.300 --> 20:35.740]  I understand that argument and I agree with it
[20:35.740 --> 20:37.900]  for the most part, but I think that there are ways
[20:37.900 --> 20:41.900]  to look at Twitter as a product that actually allows you
[20:41.900 --> 20:45.540]  to serve both of those concepts, serve the Twitter concept,
[20:45.540 --> 20:48.700]  which is sort of a real-time pillar of the internet.
[20:48.700 --> 20:51.660]  You know, you don't delete Twitter from the internet now.
[20:51.660 --> 20:55.000]  If Twitter today, if like the company disappeared,
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.220]  just some massive fold, like it turns out
[20:57.220 --> 21:00.300]  there was a Ponzi scheme and everybody in it is broke
[21:00.300 --> 21:02.700]  and there's no money anywhere and whatever, right?
[21:02.700 --> 21:06.140]  And every share is worth one cent and everybody cashes out
[21:06.140 --> 21:10.100]  and whatever, you know, the building's empty tomorrow.
[21:10.100 --> 21:13.480]  Something else would fill that void, right?
[21:13.480 --> 21:16.860]  It is something we did not understand we needed
[21:16.860 --> 21:18.740]  out of the internet until it existed.
[21:18.740 --> 21:21.060]  And now that we know that it exists,
[21:21.060 --> 21:23.060]  it's impossible to do without.
[21:23.060 --> 21:25.660]  So it's sort of one of those, you know,
[21:25.660 --> 21:28.940]  like Schrodinger's cat things, right?
[21:28.940 --> 21:31.580]  Like if you didn't never saw Twitter in the box,
[21:31.580 --> 21:33.820]  would you care that you didn't have Twitter?
[21:33.820 --> 21:36.780]  Maybe, maybe not, probably not, right?
[21:36.780 --> 21:38.780]  But now that you know it exists,
[21:38.780 --> 21:40.540]  there's absolutely no way
[21:40.540 --> 21:42.860]  that the internet exists without that
[21:42.860 --> 21:45.980]  because it's a fundamental underpinning
[21:45.980 --> 21:47.580]  of the way the internet works now.
[21:47.580 --> 21:50.820]  Not necessarily that every user of the internet uses it,
[21:50.820 --> 21:52.340]  obviously not because if so,
[21:52.340 --> 21:54.500]  they wouldn't have the problems that they're having.
[21:54.500 --> 21:59.500]  But that real time feed influences the core internet users
[22:00.880 --> 22:03.260]  that drive the experience for so many other people
[22:03.260 --> 22:05.540]  like news gatherers and newsmakers
[22:05.540 --> 22:09.260]  and people that understand the way that the internet works
[22:09.260 --> 22:11.620]  and the way that the world works in ways
[22:11.620 --> 22:13.420]  that they need to broadcast
[22:13.420 --> 22:15.120]  or feel that they wanna broadcast.
[22:15.120 --> 22:17.480]  I mean, if you look at like the Black Lives Matter movement
[22:17.480 --> 22:21.060]  and like DeRay Mckesson and like these folks
[22:21.060 --> 22:25.060]  that are on the ground in these various cities
[22:26.120 --> 22:29.060]  and when those body cam videos come out
[22:29.060 --> 22:31.900]  and they get splashed all over Twitter and get shared
[22:31.900 --> 22:33.740]  and then shared out to news sites,
[22:33.740 --> 22:37.420]  I mean, those movements would lack a,
[22:37.420 --> 22:38.680]  I mean, not that they wouldn't exist,
[22:38.680 --> 22:40.340]  you know, human beings are resilient,
[22:40.340 --> 22:43.340]  but they would definitely not have the amplification
[22:43.340 --> 22:44.180]  that they do.
[22:44.180 --> 22:45.820]  And Twitter is, you know,
[22:45.820 --> 22:46.640]  that's the way Twitter works.
[22:46.640 --> 22:48.060]  The nature of Twitter enables that, right.
[22:48.060 --> 22:49.500]  It is a tremendous news service.
[22:49.500 --> 22:50.320]  It's different.
[22:50.320 --> 22:51.680]  Like what Twitter does that's unique
[22:51.680 --> 22:53.220]  is just different and unique
[22:53.220 --> 22:56.180]  and it just measures differently than Facebook
[22:56.180 --> 22:57.500]  and it might end up being,
[22:57.500 --> 22:59.300]  and I honestly think this is true,
[22:59.300 --> 23:02.540]  it might end up being less profitable than Facebook.
[23:02.540 --> 23:04.900]  But that doesn't mean, this is what I'm getting at,
[23:04.900 --> 23:07.460]  is it doesn't mean that Twitter isn't popular
[23:07.460 --> 23:09.260]  and can't be profitable,
[23:09.260 --> 23:13.180]  just not profitable up to unreasonable expectations
[23:13.180 --> 23:14.100]  that have been set.
[23:15.180 --> 23:16.900]  Yeah, I think you're right in that for sure.
[23:16.900 --> 23:19.420]  I don't think that they're ever gonna reach Facebook scale
[23:19.420 --> 23:22.500]  or if they do, it'll be in a way we don't even see yet.
[23:23.340 --> 23:24.500]  Yeah, there was a,
[23:26.020 --> 23:28.140]  it's, oh my God, I just brought it up,
[23:28.140 --> 23:33.140]  but it's covered by a get Adobe Flash Player thing here,
[23:33.300 --> 23:36.220]  Forbes, which we can get to soon.
[23:36.220 --> 23:38.440]  But anyway, it was a thing from last December
[23:38.440 --> 23:40.620]  where Evan Williams was asked on stage
[23:40.620 --> 23:45.500]  about Instagram having more active users than Twitter.
[23:45.500 --> 23:46.540]  And he said, I don't give a shit
[23:46.540 --> 23:48.400]  if Instagram has more users.
[23:48.400 --> 23:49.900]  And then went on, you know,
[23:49.900 --> 23:52.260]  but that obviously was got the headlines, but.
[23:54.380 --> 23:56.320]  Yeah, I think there was some context missing there,
[23:56.320 --> 23:59.260]  but overall, I think the sentiment is kind of accurate.
[23:59.260 --> 24:00.820]  That's what they need to feel.
[24:00.820 --> 24:03.340]  Here, I'll quote Evan Williams.
[24:03.340 --> 24:04.380]  It's not too long.
[24:04.380 --> 24:05.220]  Here's what he said.
[24:05.220 --> 24:08.180]  It's a question of breadth versus depth.
[24:08.180 --> 24:10.620]  Why is users the only thing we talk about?
[24:10.620 --> 24:13.140]  The crazy thing, Facebook has done an amazing job
[24:13.140 --> 24:16.660]  of establishing that as the metric for Wall Street.
[24:16.660 --> 24:20.220]  No one ever talks about what is a monthly active user.
[24:20.220 --> 24:22.860]  I believe it's the case that if you use Facebook Connect,
[24:22.860 --> 24:25.120]  if you use an app that you logged into
[24:25.120 --> 24:27.680]  with Facebook Connect, you're considered a Facebook user,
[24:27.680 --> 24:30.100]  whether or not you ever launched the Facebook app
[24:30.100 --> 24:31.700]  or went to facebook.com.
[24:31.700 --> 24:32.640]  So what does that mean?
[24:32.640 --> 24:34.900]  It's become so abstract to be meaningless.
[24:34.900 --> 24:37.260]  Something you did caused some data in their servers
[24:37.260 --> 24:38.880]  to be recorded for the month.
[24:38.880 --> 24:41.500]  So I think we're on the wrong path.
[24:41.500 --> 24:43.260]  If you think, and I think what he means by that
[24:43.260 --> 24:45.300]  is we as an industry are on the wrong path
[24:45.300 --> 24:48.080]  about measuring monthly active users is this thing.
[24:49.060 --> 24:50.220]  Back to Evan Williams' quote.
[24:50.220 --> 24:52.940]  If you think about the impact Twitter has on the world
[24:52.940 --> 24:55.420]  versus Instagram, it's pretty significant.
[24:55.420 --> 24:57.220]  It's at least apples to oranges.
[24:57.220 --> 24:59.180]  Twitter is what we wanted it to be.
[24:59.180 --> 25:01.060]  It's this real-time information network
[25:01.060 --> 25:03.000]  where everything in the world that happens on Twitter,
[25:03.000 --> 25:04.980]  important stuff breaks on Twitter
[25:04.980 --> 25:07.660]  and world leaders have conversations on Twitter.
[25:07.660 --> 25:09.880]  If that's happening, I frankly don't give a shit
[25:09.880 --> 25:13.020]  if Instagram has more people looking at pretty pictures.
[25:13.020 --> 25:14.220]  End quote.
[25:14.220 --> 25:16.540]  And that to me is a very compelling argument
[25:16.540 --> 25:19.800]  and I hope that that, you know,
[25:19.800 --> 25:21.940]  the fact that Evan Williams is still on the board
[25:21.940 --> 25:23.540]  and is obviously has some influence,
[25:23.540 --> 25:25.820]  that it's, you know, my big fear about Twitter
[25:25.820 --> 25:27.500]  is that they're gonna bring in somebody
[25:27.500 --> 25:31.100]  who is going to destroy what Twitter is good for
[25:31.100 --> 25:34.580]  in a vain attempt to...
[25:34.580 --> 25:35.620]  Emulate Facebook.
[25:35.620 --> 25:36.460]  Right.
[25:36.460 --> 25:37.280]  Yeah.
[25:37.280 --> 25:39.980]  Yeah, I mean, I think that there is a solution
[25:39.980 --> 25:41.900]  and I'm no, you know, I'm just a dude
[25:41.900 --> 25:43.360]  who writes about things on the internet, right?
[25:43.360 --> 25:44.980]  So this is easy for me to say
[25:44.980 --> 25:46.840]  and hard for anybody else to do.
[25:46.840 --> 25:48.340]  But I think that there is a solution.
[25:48.340 --> 25:50.260]  That solution is to treat logged in Twitter
[25:50.260 --> 25:52.660]  and logged out Twitter as two separate products.
[25:52.660 --> 25:55.540]  And I think that they are starting to do that a little bit.
[25:55.540 --> 25:58.980]  They've launched some things that are fainting at that.
[25:58.980 --> 26:00.580]  But I also feel that they haven't had
[26:00.580 --> 26:02.260]  a unified product strategy
[26:02.260 --> 26:03.380]  that they've been able to stick to
[26:03.380 --> 26:06.560]  for longer than a couple of quarters in quite some time.
[26:06.560 --> 26:08.740]  So it's gonna take a while to see if this pans out
[26:08.740 --> 26:10.240]  and whoever they bring in for leadership
[26:10.240 --> 26:12.340]  is going to need to feel the same way.
[26:12.340 --> 26:14.260]  It's like bringing in a new librarian, right?
[26:14.260 --> 26:16.040]  And that new librarian's gonna need to feel the same way
[26:16.040 --> 26:17.520]  about the way the catalog works.
[26:17.520 --> 26:19.600]  Otherwise we're gonna end up with a mess again.
[26:19.600 --> 26:24.600]  But logged in Twitter is a place for creators.
[26:25.140 --> 26:30.000]  It's a place for people that make and do and see and speak.
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.180]  And logged out Twitter is for consumers.
[26:33.180 --> 26:36.040]  It's a place where people like to consume
[26:36.040 --> 26:38.700]  and see the things that people make
[26:38.700 --> 26:42.060]  and take in the things that people say
[26:42.060 --> 26:44.760]  and hopefully grow smarter or grow more enlightened
[26:44.760 --> 26:47.340]  or just be entertained or whatever.
[26:47.340 --> 26:50.100]  It doesn't matter whether it's Drake
[26:50.100 --> 26:52.020]  laying down a diss track against Meek Mill
[26:52.020 --> 26:56.020]  and tweeting it out or whether it's the Iran deal
[26:56.020 --> 26:56.940]  and that's breaking.
[26:56.940 --> 27:01.420]  And in either one, there's bliss in either one.
[27:01.420 --> 27:04.860]  And that I think, that ability to treat them
[27:04.860 --> 27:06.820]  as different things, different entities
[27:06.820 --> 27:09.380]  and hold those two ideas in their hand at the same time
[27:09.380 --> 27:11.740]  and service those two audiences is gonna be key
[27:11.740 --> 27:14.580]  to whether or not they make it a success at scale,
[27:14.580 --> 27:16.100]  at a large, large scale.
[27:16.100 --> 27:19.140]  Do you, I'm sure that you do,
[27:19.140 --> 27:21.020]  but I'm guessing a lot of people who listen don't,
[27:21.020 --> 27:23.980]  but do you follow Magic Rex?
[27:23.980 --> 27:25.200]  Yeah, mm-hmm, yep.
[27:25.200 --> 27:27.820]  So Magic Rex, for anybody who doesn't know,
[27:27.820 --> 27:30.260]  it's the account is at-
[27:30.260 --> 27:32.180]  I actually broke the story about it existing, by the way.
[27:32.180 --> 27:33.940]  Oh, there you go, congratulations.
[27:33.940 --> 27:37.260]  All right, then you probably do know about it.
[27:37.260 --> 27:38.300]  Yeah.
[27:38.300 --> 27:41.140]  So Magic Rex, or then you tell me what Magic Rex is.
[27:41.140 --> 27:45.580]  The user account is M-A-G-I-C, capital R-E-C-S,
[27:45.580 --> 27:49.340]  like as in Rex-like recommendations, R-E-C-S.
[27:49.340 --> 27:50.180]  Right, right.
[27:50.180 --> 27:52.020]  So Magic Rex was, the long story short,
[27:52.020 --> 27:53.660]  Magic Rex was an experiment done
[27:53.660 --> 27:55.580]  by the experimental division at Twitter.
[27:55.580 --> 27:57.780]  It's kind of a handful of people that do,
[27:57.780 --> 28:00.140]  some of them have left since, and I think it still exists,
[28:00.140 --> 28:03.340]  but they do experiments with Twitter data.
[28:03.340 --> 28:06.600]  And some of that existed to sort of surface good content.
[28:06.600 --> 28:08.860]  They're like, hey, how would we tell somebody
[28:08.860 --> 28:10.520]  if there's somebody worth following?
[28:10.520 --> 28:12.340]  And you could say, oh, well,
[28:12.340 --> 28:13.940]  this person just gained a bunch of followers,
[28:13.940 --> 28:15.620]  but that doesn't tell the whole story.
[28:15.620 --> 28:18.540]  You know, they need to be important to you personally.
[28:18.540 --> 28:20.300]  Why else would you wanna follow them?
[28:20.300 --> 28:21.840]  So they came up with this idea
[28:21.840 --> 28:26.840]  to create a Twitter account at first as an experiment
[28:27.780 --> 28:30.500]  that Twitter account would then funnel
[28:30.500 --> 28:35.060]  in the context of your followers, who you followed,
[28:35.060 --> 28:38.900]  and it says, oh, if John, Sally, and Jane in your network
[28:38.900 --> 28:41.540]  followed this person, you might wanna follow them too.
[28:41.540 --> 28:43.760]  So it sends you a DM, and it says,
[28:43.760 --> 28:46.580]  hey, John, Sally, and Jane just followed this person
[28:46.580 --> 28:49.040]  along with nine other people.
[28:49.040 --> 28:50.300]  So you might wanna follow them.
[28:50.300 --> 28:52.420]  And you can follow them, you could click on the account.
[28:52.420 --> 28:54.180]  I often go in there and like, who,
[28:54.180 --> 28:55.380]  you know, why did they follow this person?
[28:55.380 --> 28:56.540]  And you're like, oh, they just got hired
[28:56.540 --> 28:57.980]  by this publication, right?
[28:57.980 --> 28:59.700]  That makes sense.
[28:59.700 --> 29:02.860]  And then they also started running an experiment
[29:02.860 --> 29:05.220]  in the same manner on tweets.
[29:05.220 --> 29:07.740]  So if somebody tweeted something that was favorited
[29:07.740 --> 29:09.260]  by a bunch of people in your network,
[29:09.260 --> 29:12.420]  people you follow or people you interact with regularly,
[29:12.420 --> 29:14.180]  it would then surface that tweet for you.
[29:14.180 --> 29:17.580]  Say, look, seven people you know favorited this tweet.
[29:17.580 --> 29:19.620]  It's probably something you wanna look at.
[29:19.620 --> 29:22.020]  So that was the genesis of the experiment.
[29:22.020 --> 29:26.020]  I find it to be extraordinarily successful.
[29:27.580 --> 29:31.460]  So I follow, I get DMs from the Magic Rex account,
[29:31.460 --> 29:32.460]  and I'm just checking right here.
[29:32.460 --> 29:34.780]  It looks like I got 10 in the last month.
[29:34.780 --> 29:36.860]  So it certainly doesn't badger me.
[29:36.860 --> 29:39.840]  It looks like, you know, at least in the last month,
[29:39.840 --> 29:42.200]  I've gotten one every three days.
[29:42.200 --> 29:43.860]  And they're all good.
[29:43.860 --> 29:47.220]  It's, there's a bunch of them this month
[29:47.220 --> 29:49.540]  have been about favorited tweets.
[29:49.540 --> 29:51.820]  And most of them, you know, sometimes they're ones
[29:51.820 --> 29:53.340]  that I've actually seen,
[29:54.460 --> 29:56.540]  or it's about a thing that I know about,
[29:56.540 --> 29:58.280]  but most of them weren't.
[29:58.280 --> 30:00.180]  And they were all worth looking at,
[30:00.180 --> 30:05.180]  like remarkably useful for some kind of AI bot
[30:05.860 --> 30:06.820]  in terms of that.
[30:06.820 --> 30:09.420]  And like you said, there's a bunch that are like somebody,
[30:09.420 --> 30:12.940]  some new account is just followed by, you know, somebody.
[30:12.940 --> 30:15.920]  And it's also remarkable to me how quickly some of them.
[30:17.420 --> 30:18.340]  All right.
[30:18.340 --> 30:21.220]  I actually warn my writers if we hire somebody
[30:21.220 --> 30:23.180]  not to follow them immediately
[30:23.180 --> 30:24.820]  so that I can announce that writer.
[30:24.820 --> 30:27.300]  Because if all of my writers follow them,
[30:27.300 --> 30:31.780]  all journalism is, it's a uniquely navel-gazing
[30:31.780 --> 30:33.860]  and insular industry, especially on Twitter.
[30:33.860 --> 30:35.460]  So all journalists follow each other
[30:35.460 --> 30:36.500]  and we all talk to each other.
[30:36.500 --> 30:39.500]  And that sometimes distorts what we think is important,
[30:39.500 --> 30:41.500]  but that's a whole nother story.
[30:41.500 --> 30:44.900]  But if they all follow this writer all at once, bam,
[30:44.900 --> 30:49.260]  then they, it pops a magic wreck on all my competitors
[30:49.260 --> 30:50.380]  and they'll know that I hired them
[30:50.380 --> 30:52.060]  before I'm ready to announce.
[30:52.060 --> 30:54.100]  So I actually tell them not to follow them.
[30:54.100 --> 30:58.300]  The magic, here's one for the at Edge TV account.
[30:58.300 --> 31:00.540]  Now that's a new like sort of,
[31:00.540 --> 31:01.920]  I actually haven't looked at it yet,
[31:01.920 --> 31:04.660]  but it's from the Onion video group.
[31:04.660 --> 31:05.500]  I think it's like-
[31:05.500 --> 31:06.340]  It's hilarious actually.
[31:06.340 --> 31:10.780]  It's a fake parody vice, sort of.
[31:10.780 --> 31:12.580]  Yeah, it's a parody vice, yeah.
[31:12.580 --> 31:16.380]  Yeah, it's like hipster-type independent journalists
[31:16.380 --> 31:21.260]  on around the world in dangerous situations,
[31:21.260 --> 31:22.800]  but it's a parody.
[31:22.800 --> 31:26.480]  But I got, a couple days ago, I got a at Edge TV
[31:26.480 --> 31:30.480]  was just followed by Josh Centers 11 seconds ago,
[31:30.480 --> 31:34.240]  and at Matt and Jessica Mizner.
[31:34.240 --> 31:37.820]  But 11 seconds after Josh Centers followed them,
[31:37.820 --> 31:40.560]  the Magic Wrecks account sent me a DM and said,
[31:40.560 --> 31:42.580]  hey, this, you know, Josh-
[31:42.580 --> 31:44.320]  You should definitely pay attention to this account.
[31:44.320 --> 31:45.820]  Right, this guy from, you know,
[31:45.820 --> 31:48.580]  the guy who's the editor at Tidbits now
[31:48.580 --> 31:51.500]  and Matt Honan and Jessica Mizner.
[31:51.500 --> 31:53.940]  So three media people who I follow all followed it.
[31:53.940 --> 31:55.040]  You know, you might want to know.
[31:55.040 --> 31:56.260]  And I did, I followed it.
[31:56.260 --> 31:57.640]  It was worth it.
[31:57.640 --> 31:58.720]  The thing that I'm getting at though,
[31:58.720 --> 32:02.140]  is that the data that makes Magic Wrecks work,
[32:02.140 --> 32:05.700]  the thinking and whatever information they have,
[32:05.700 --> 32:10.440]  if they could show me ads at about the same pace,
[32:10.440 --> 32:11.900]  show me 10 of them a month,
[32:11.900 --> 32:16.300]  but have them be as interesting to me as these are,
[32:16.300 --> 32:17.140]  that's gold.
[32:17.140 --> 32:19.360]  That is absolute positive gold.
[32:19.360 --> 32:21.540]  Like they're obviously finding things
[32:21.540 --> 32:23.360]  that I think are interesting.
[32:23.360 --> 32:26.740]  And I think that their potential is clearly there
[32:26.740 --> 32:28.560]  that they could sell me things
[32:28.560 --> 32:30.100]  that I would be interested in.
[32:30.100 --> 32:33.500]  Well, you know, the ads, the thing about Twitter ads
[32:33.500 --> 32:36.180]  is that they're actually really good already.
[32:36.180 --> 32:37.660]  Like a lot of people don't know this
[32:37.660 --> 32:41.320]  because the company itself is maligned on the whole
[32:41.320 --> 32:42.920]  because of its lack of user growth.
[32:42.920 --> 32:45.940]  Although, you know, as you already touched on,
[32:45.940 --> 32:48.940]  those metrics can be argued against, right?
[32:48.940 --> 32:51.820]  Strongly, you know, daily active users
[32:51.820 --> 32:53.060]  and monthly active users and everything.
[32:53.060 --> 32:54.780]  But they're maligned because those metrics
[32:54.780 --> 32:56.620]  have been established and they are what they are.
[32:56.620 --> 33:00.940]  But their ads and monetization departments
[33:00.940 --> 33:04.620]  actually outperform the company significantly.
[33:04.620 --> 33:06.920]  And I mean, you use outperform very loosely there,
[33:06.920 --> 33:09.380]  but they perform in an outsized manner
[33:09.380 --> 33:11.100]  considering how many users they have.
[33:11.100 --> 33:12.980]  And so if they actually were able
[33:12.980 --> 33:14.820]  to solve the user growth problem
[33:14.820 --> 33:16.820]  or find a different way to count those users,
[33:16.820 --> 33:18.940]  people that viewed embedded tweets, for instance,
[33:18.940 --> 33:21.420]  included in monthly active users, that sort of thing,
[33:21.420 --> 33:23.720]  if they were able to fix that for the market,
[33:23.720 --> 33:25.500]  I think it would actually go insane
[33:25.500 --> 33:29.300]  because the Twitter ads department,
[33:29.300 --> 33:30.460]  which is the revenue department,
[33:30.460 --> 33:32.180]  which is led by Adam Bain, who is, by the way,
[33:32.180 --> 33:34.260]  one of the front runners for CEO,
[33:34.260 --> 33:37.140]  is actually really, really well-performing
[33:37.140 --> 33:42.140]  and that the ads there are served up with intelligence.
[33:43.260 --> 33:44.820]  However, I agree with you
[33:44.820 --> 33:46.400]  that they could be much, much smarter.
[33:46.400 --> 33:50.860]  If I got an ad that I know was personalized like Magic Rex,
[33:50.860 --> 33:53.560]  I feel it would be even more effective.
[33:53.560 --> 33:55.940]  But I'm no smarty in the ads department.
[33:55.940 --> 33:58.380]  I agree with you, though, that that could be a good concept.
[33:58.380 --> 34:00.020]  The potential is clearly there.
[34:00.020 --> 34:03.100]  Yeah, I mean, Magic Rex actually, just real briefly,
[34:03.100 --> 34:04.620]  Magic Rex was actually integrated
[34:04.620 --> 34:06.340]  into the main Twitter product.
[34:06.340 --> 34:08.420]  Like it was absorbed into the main product
[34:08.420 --> 34:10.840]  as of late 2013, I think, sometime.
[34:11.820 --> 34:13.820]  And so if you don't have Magic Rex,
[34:13.820 --> 34:15.380]  if you've never heard of the account,
[34:15.380 --> 34:17.900]  but you've gotten a notification that says,
[34:17.900 --> 34:20.080]  hey, this person was just followed,
[34:20.080 --> 34:22.120]  or you should look at this tweet,
[34:22.120 --> 34:24.860]  that's built off of that Magic Rex experiment.
[34:24.860 --> 34:26.200]  They sort of folded it in.
[34:26.200 --> 34:28.180]  But I, of course, still follow the account,
[34:28.180 --> 34:29.700]  and I get the DM directly.
[34:29.700 --> 34:33.140]  I actually like it that way better than a notification.
[34:33.140 --> 34:35.380]  Tip of the day for those of you who haven't tried it,
[34:35.380 --> 34:37.220]  especially, I think,
[34:37.220 --> 34:39.420]  because I'm guessing a lot of people
[34:39.420 --> 34:40.460]  who listen to the show are like me
[34:40.460 --> 34:42.820]  and don't really even know
[34:42.820 --> 34:44.980]  what the main Twitter experience is like,
[34:44.980 --> 34:48.220]  because we all use Tweetbot or Twitturrific.
[34:48.220 --> 34:52.940]  You know, nothing like that would surface for me
[34:52.940 --> 34:55.800]  if I weren't following the Magic Rex account.
[34:55.800 --> 34:56.940]  Right, exactly.
[34:56.940 --> 34:59.860]  Platform agnostic, which is when Twitter's at its best,
[34:59.860 --> 35:02.260]  but you know, that's another discussion too.
[35:02.260 --> 35:04.960]  Yeah, anyway, speaking of ads,
[35:04.960 --> 35:07.420]  let's thank the first sponsor of the week,
[35:07.420 --> 35:10.000]  and it's a longtime friend of the show,
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.580]  back sponsoring the show again,
[35:12.580 --> 35:17.340]  lynda.com, L-Y-N-D-A dot com.
[35:17.340 --> 35:21.820]  lynda.com is in a nut, online learning.
[35:21.820 --> 35:26.180]  You go there and you can learn all sorts of creative stuff.
[35:27.700 --> 35:32.420]  3,000 courses, over 3,000 courses on topics
[35:32.420 --> 35:37.420]  like web development, photography, visual design,
[35:37.500 --> 35:39.940]  user interface design, graphic design,
[35:39.940 --> 35:41.740]  and business, business stuff too.
[35:41.740 --> 35:44.380]  Anything, just about anything you can learn
[35:44.380 --> 35:48.380]  in the modern world, lynda.com has courses on it.
[35:48.380 --> 35:49.920]  Just even just software training,
[35:49.920 --> 35:52.960]  Excel, WordPress, Photoshop.
[35:52.960 --> 35:56.180]  All of their courses are taught by experts,
[35:56.180 --> 35:59.020]  and new courses are added to the site every week,
[35:59.020 --> 36:00.700]  and I cannot emphasize how true this is.
[36:00.700 --> 36:02.660]  Like when they've been sponsoring before,
[36:02.660 --> 36:04.020]  and I go and check it out,
[36:04.020 --> 36:07.540]  the new stuff that they add every week is just unbelievable.
[36:07.540 --> 36:09.900]  Whether you wanna set new financial goals,
[36:09.900 --> 36:12.060]  whether you wanna further your career,
[36:12.060 --> 36:14.000]  whether you wanna start a new career,
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.260]  just learn a new skill for a hobby.
[36:16.260 --> 36:19.340]  lynda.com is an absolutely tremendous way
[36:19.340 --> 36:20.620]  to learn to do this.
[36:20.620 --> 36:22.900]  Now, here's the thing, you can sign up
[36:22.900 --> 36:27.340]  for a free 10-day trial by visiting lynda.com,
[36:27.340 --> 36:30.780]  L-Y-N-D-A dot com slash the talk show,
[36:31.740 --> 36:35.180]  and you will get unlimited access
[36:35.180 --> 36:37.580]  to every course on lynda.com
[36:37.580 --> 36:39.540]  to access, to view the tutorials.
[36:41.300 --> 36:42.380]  You could do it on tablets,
[36:42.380 --> 36:44.840]  you could do it on the desktop web browser,
[36:45.980 --> 36:47.940]  use your iPhone, Android, whatever.
[36:47.940 --> 36:50.900]  You got 10 days, and you could just view it all,
[36:50.900 --> 36:52.940]  consume as much as you can in the 10-day trial.
[36:52.940 --> 36:54.260]  That's how convinced they are
[36:54.260 --> 36:56.520]  that if you just get started and give them a shot
[36:56.520 --> 37:00.260]  and do it for free, that you are going to sign up.
[37:01.260 --> 37:03.740]  Really can't emphasize how great this is.
[37:03.740 --> 37:05.380]  Really, really great stuff.
[37:05.380 --> 37:06.220]  I've learned a lot.
[37:06.220 --> 37:07.660]  I did the Lightroom one,
[37:09.020 --> 37:12.180]  and it's like it changed me from being somebody,
[37:12.180 --> 37:13.940]  like a trained monkey using Lightroom
[37:13.940 --> 37:15.940]  to actually feeling like a photographer.
[37:17.300 --> 37:18.420]  Great, great stuff.
[37:19.700 --> 37:20.740]  So here's the deal.
[37:20.740 --> 37:24.820]  Go there, free trial, lynda.com slash the talk show,
[37:24.820 --> 37:27.740]  and go learn something new.
[37:27.740 --> 37:28.700]  My thanks to Linda.
[37:31.300 --> 37:32.120]  What else?
[37:32.120 --> 37:33.380]  Oh, so here's the other thing I wanna talk about, Twitter,
[37:33.380 --> 37:35.700]  before we move on from Twitter.
[37:35.700 --> 37:37.220]  So the problem that I did,
[37:37.220 --> 37:38.660]  the bigger problem I see with Twitter,
[37:38.660 --> 37:40.180]  or the immediate problem I see with Twitter,
[37:40.180 --> 37:42.580]  is that their stock is in free fall.
[37:42.580 --> 37:44.440]  Now, maybe free fall's a little dramatic,
[37:44.440 --> 37:48.980]  but it's significantly down.
[37:48.980 --> 37:49.820]  It's down below.
[37:49.820 --> 37:50.660]  I think it still is.
[37:50.660 --> 37:53.540]  Actually, I haven't checked since the last time I looked.
[37:53.540 --> 37:55.000]  Oh, it is.
[37:55.000 --> 38:00.000]  It's down below the IPO level, which is dangerous.
[38:00.260 --> 38:02.700]  Dangerous meaning that obviously,
[38:02.700 --> 38:04.680]  the lower the stock drops,
[38:04.680 --> 38:09.540]  the more likely it is that somebody is going to buy them.
[38:09.540 --> 38:13.100]  It opened at 41, and it's currently at 27.
[38:13.100 --> 38:15.100]  Right, so I think it's a market cap
[38:15.100 --> 38:17.380]  of around 19 billion, something like that.
[38:17.380 --> 38:20.460]  17.89, according to Google, just what I'm looking at.
[38:20.460 --> 38:22.260]  So then add a little premium,
[38:22.260 --> 38:24.660]  because you've gotta add a premium.
[38:24.660 --> 38:27.780]  Somebody could probably acquire Twitter,
[38:27.780 --> 38:31.000]  call it a hostile takeover, for around 20 billion.
[38:31.000 --> 38:34.820]  And it might, if the trend continues,
[38:34.820 --> 38:36.300]  that number gets lower and lower,
[38:36.300 --> 38:38.380]  and eventually it's going to reach a point
[38:38.380 --> 38:40.380]  where that's going to happen.
[38:40.380 --> 38:43.060]  It's inevitable if the stock keeps dropping
[38:43.060 --> 38:44.800]  that somebody is going to buy them.
[38:47.220 --> 38:49.540]  And I asked on Twitter the other day, who?
[38:49.540 --> 38:52.040]  And the companies that popped to mind for me immediately
[38:52.040 --> 38:54.920]  were Facebook, Google, Microsoft.
[38:57.240 --> 38:59.340]  Somebody else had a good one that I didn't think of.
[38:59.340 --> 39:02.340]  Apple obviously could, because they had the money.
[39:02.340 --> 39:03.460]  I don't think Apple would,
[39:03.460 --> 39:05.860]  so I would drop Apple from the discussion immediately.
[39:05.860 --> 39:07.420]  I don't think Apple would see any interest
[39:07.420 --> 39:08.860]  in owning Twitter.
[39:08.860 --> 39:10.500]  No, I don't think so.
[39:10.500 --> 39:12.740]  Just doesn't make sense.
[39:12.740 --> 39:14.620]  Right, I've thought about it before,
[39:14.620 --> 39:17.020]  and yeah, it's never made real sense to me.
[39:19.940 --> 39:22.540]  So one thought is that maybe this would be a good thing,
[39:22.540 --> 39:27.500]  because if somebody bought Twitter and left them alone
[39:27.500 --> 39:30.700]  and let them be Twitter, then all of these pressures
[39:30.700 --> 39:32.820]  that are unreasonable are gone.
[39:33.980 --> 39:36.540]  On the other hand, a lot of times companies
[39:36.540 --> 39:39.760]  buy smaller companies and wreck them.
[39:41.980 --> 39:44.420]  More often than not, they do, let's be honest.
[39:44.420 --> 39:47.580]  It is when it doesn't happen, like with Vine, for instance,
[39:47.580 --> 39:48.500]  like Twitter bought Vine,
[39:48.500 --> 39:49.820]  and Vine's actually doing really well,
[39:49.820 --> 39:51.540]  and I think is this super, super cool thing
[39:51.540 --> 39:53.480]  that's much different than when they bought it,
[39:53.480 --> 39:54.660]  but still very neat.
[39:54.660 --> 39:55.740]  They didn't wreck that.
[39:55.740 --> 39:59.300]  But when that happens, we're all surprised and delighted.
[39:59.300 --> 40:02.480]  I think the average company that gets acquired
[40:02.480 --> 40:06.060]  is gonna get mashed up in some way to fit the revenue
[40:06.060 --> 40:10.860]  and outlook that the parent company kind of wants from it.
[40:10.860 --> 40:12.340]  Yeah, and Vine is interesting.
[40:12.340 --> 40:14.060]  I don't really use Vine.
[40:14.060 --> 40:15.700]  I should say I don't use Vine.
[40:15.700 --> 40:16.860]  I obviously know what it is,
[40:16.860 --> 40:21.760]  but it was news to me that there are,
[40:21.760 --> 40:23.160]  maybe there's not as many,
[40:23.160 --> 40:26.040]  but in the way that there are professional YouTubers,
[40:27.340 --> 40:30.540]  there are professional Vine people,
[40:30.540 --> 40:31.820]  people who are doing,
[40:31.820 --> 40:35.540]  whose Vine accounts have enough followers
[40:35.540 --> 40:38.660]  and who can charge enough for sponsored posts.
[40:42.020 --> 40:43.740]  It sounds like lingo,
[40:43.740 --> 40:46.700]  but it's not a bad term, native content.
[40:46.700 --> 40:49.300]  In other words, you have a lot of Vine followers,
[40:49.300 --> 40:54.300]  and a sponsor pays you to do a six-second Vine
[40:55.780 --> 40:56.980]  featuring their product,
[40:56.980 --> 41:01.180]  and you have all these followers
[41:01.180 --> 41:02.540]  because your Vines are funny.
[41:02.540 --> 41:06.860]  You make a funny Vine featuring Coca-Cola,
[41:06.860 --> 41:08.540]  and everybody's happy, right?
[41:10.340 --> 41:13.220]  It's that win-win-win virtuous cycle of,
[41:13.220 --> 41:14.500]  I know native content, again,
[41:14.500 --> 41:17.060]  it sounds like some kind of weird business development term,
[41:17.060 --> 41:18.960]  but when it works, it's really great
[41:18.960 --> 41:21.880]  because the video is just as funny as your other stuff.
[41:21.880 --> 41:23.380]  You can acknowledge it.
[41:23.380 --> 41:25.680]  You put it in a hashtag or in the comment
[41:25.680 --> 41:26.720]  that this was sponsored,
[41:26.720 --> 41:28.960]  so you're not trying to hide it,
[41:29.920 --> 41:30.980]  but your followers are happy
[41:30.980 --> 41:32.580]  because it's another funny video,
[41:32.580 --> 41:33.660]  and the sponsor's happy
[41:33.660 --> 41:37.540]  because the million people who follow you
[41:37.540 --> 41:40.140]  or 500,000 people or whatever
[41:40.140 --> 41:41.940]  had their product in front of them.
[41:41.940 --> 41:43.740]  Right, right, absolutely,
[41:43.740 --> 41:45.960]  and I think that's the way that most Viners
[41:45.960 --> 41:48.340]  are making any money if they are currently.
[41:49.380 --> 41:51.380]  Twitter actually bought a company called Niche,
[41:51.380 --> 41:54.700]  which it uses to sort of pair up Viners with brands
[41:54.700 --> 41:56.460]  for advertisement that it basically,
[41:56.460 --> 41:58.660]  they created on Vine, posted on Vine,
[41:58.660 --> 42:01.100]  and then it gets used in an ad on Twitter.
[42:01.100 --> 42:02.560]  Vine has very little to do with that.
[42:02.560 --> 42:03.920]  They actually are not involved
[42:03.920 --> 42:06.860]  in monetizing any Viners stuff at all.
[42:06.860 --> 42:08.460]  They basically make the tools,
[42:08.460 --> 42:10.660]  and then the Viners do the rest.
[42:10.660 --> 42:12.900]  At least that's the way it currently works,
[42:12.900 --> 42:14.780]  but Twitter is definitely using some of that
[42:14.780 --> 42:15.600]  to their advantage.
[42:15.600 --> 42:19.000]  They're saying, hey, Coke, we've got this ad,
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.340]  we've got this ad, and we've got a Vine, right?
[42:21.340 --> 42:24.380]  Like you can make a Vine and tweet that out and promote that,
[42:24.380 --> 42:26.100]  and then people will watch it there.
[42:26.100 --> 42:27.260]  They'll watch it on Vine,
[42:27.260 --> 42:28.740]  and you'll get the natural uplift
[42:28.740 --> 42:31.980]  of those millions of followers of that particular Viner.
[42:31.980 --> 42:36.660]  And some of these Viners are bonafide celebrities.
[42:36.660 --> 42:38.980]  I mean, talking, screaming teenage girls,
[42:38.980 --> 42:42.980]  thousands in a conference waiting to see them, celebrities.
[42:42.980 --> 42:46.140]  These are not by any means like flash in the pan,
[42:46.140 --> 42:47.900]  weird little pigeon hole celebrities.
[42:47.900 --> 42:52.340]  These are genuine as what we would think of a movie star
[42:52.340 --> 42:56.700]  in like the Hedy Lamarr movie star fashion.
[42:56.700 --> 42:58.300]  This is the modern equivalent.
[42:58.300 --> 43:02.940]  Brad Pitt is not Brad Pitt to 12 to 15 year olds.
[43:02.940 --> 43:05.420]  These Viners are, that's their Brad Pitt.
[43:05.420 --> 43:08.140]  That's their idol that they,
[43:08.140 --> 43:10.780]  and the great news is they're way more accessible
[43:10.780 --> 43:11.780]  than Brad Pitt ever was.
[43:11.780 --> 43:13.980]  So they can generate much more buzz
[43:13.980 --> 43:16.540]  and theoretically earn a living at it
[43:16.540 --> 43:18.700]  and keep going down that path
[43:18.700 --> 43:22.740]  towards whatever their final goal is of celebrity.
[43:22.740 --> 43:25.420]  I have a link, I will put it in the show notes.
[43:25.420 --> 43:29.580]  I've actually meant to post this to Daring Fireball,
[43:29.580 --> 43:31.500]  but I didn't finish the article
[43:31.500 --> 43:34.220]  and this is a good reminder to me to finish it
[43:34.220 --> 43:35.940]  after we do this, but it's fascinating.
[43:35.940 --> 43:40.940]  It's a July 31, so it's just like a week old article
[43:41.140 --> 43:46.140]  from Vanity Fair by Richard Lawson
[43:47.180 --> 43:51.100]  and he went to VidCon, V-I-D-C-O-N in Anaheim,
[43:51.100 --> 43:56.100]  which is like where all of these YouTubes
[43:56.580 --> 44:00.300]  and Vine celebrities, 200 of them,
[44:00.300 --> 44:02.620]  or 200 of them are considered millionaires
[44:02.620 --> 44:05.220]  that they're making over a million dollars a year, I guess,
[44:05.220 --> 44:06.780]  is what their definition of millionaire is.
[44:06.780 --> 44:09.620]  But anyway, a lot of money, serious celebrity
[44:09.620 --> 44:12.820]  and this is where their fans got to meet them
[44:12.820 --> 44:14.980]  and the picture is just,
[44:14.980 --> 44:17.980]  it looks like the modern day equivalent
[44:17.980 --> 44:21.940]  of like when the Beatles came to America in the 60s.
[44:21.940 --> 44:22.900]  No, I mean it's.
[44:22.900 --> 44:24.420]  No, no, yeah, I agree.
[44:24.420 --> 44:27.220]  It's not just thousands of teenagers,
[44:27.220 --> 44:30.580]  it's thousands of teenagers in ecstasy
[44:30.580 --> 44:31.420]  that they are screaming.
[44:31.420 --> 44:33.860]  Right, that's a good way to put it, ecstasy, yeah.
[44:36.020 --> 44:37.900]  It is so funny, it is the modern world
[44:37.900 --> 44:41.700]  and of course they all have iPhones up in the air.
[44:41.700 --> 44:43.700]  Every single one, every single one.
[44:43.700 --> 44:45.900]  It's rare to find a Vine creator actually
[44:45.900 --> 44:48.340]  that doesn't use an iPhone because the camera quality.
[44:48.340 --> 44:49.180]  No, I'll bet.
[44:49.180 --> 44:51.020]  Which makes total sense, yeah.
[44:51.020 --> 44:55.340]  But the fact that this is where celebrities are today,
[44:55.340 --> 44:59.260]  and the advertisers are smart, they're not behind.
[44:59.260 --> 45:04.260]  People like me who's rocketing towards old age are old
[45:04.260 --> 45:06.740]  but the marketers are smart and more or less.
[45:06.740 --> 45:08.620]  So that's why a company like Coke,
[45:08.620 --> 45:10.420]  and you think wow, wow, that's pretty interesting
[45:10.420 --> 45:13.980]  that an established, Coke is arguably
[45:13.980 --> 45:16.260]  like the establishment of the marketing
[45:16.260 --> 45:19.140]  and advertising world, that they're already doing this.
[45:19.140 --> 45:21.820]  Well of course they are because they know
[45:21.820 --> 45:24.820]  that if you wanna reach teenagers,
[45:24.820 --> 45:27.700]  and of course Coca-Cola wants to reach teenagers.
[45:27.700 --> 45:30.220]  If they don't, they're screwed.
[45:30.220 --> 45:32.900]  Well you don't do that on TV.
[45:34.700 --> 45:38.100]  And that TV as the main place for an advertiser
[45:38.100 --> 45:43.100]  like Coke to reach teenagers spans generations, plural.
[45:43.100 --> 45:46.220]  I mean like by the time you and I were born,
[45:46.220 --> 45:47.460]  that was already the case.
[45:47.460 --> 45:50.300]  It was already the case.
[45:50.300 --> 45:51.740]  Don Draper dreamed up the,
[45:51.740 --> 45:56.180]  I'd like to sing the world to Coke before I was born.
[45:56.180 --> 45:58.380]  That's before I was born where TV
[45:58.380 --> 46:00.100]  was the primary thing for that.
[46:00.100 --> 46:03.220]  So it's very, very easy when something like TV
[46:03.220 --> 46:07.140]  has been established as the medium to reach teenagers
[46:07.140 --> 46:11.860]  for entire lifetimes of people in the industry right now.
[46:11.860 --> 46:16.420]  It's very easy to let that sort of settle in like cement,
[46:16.420 --> 46:17.300]  but it's not.
[46:17.300 --> 46:19.820]  I mean like my son, my 11 year old son,
[46:19.820 --> 46:23.660]  he doesn't, he hardly watches any broadcast TV at all.
[46:23.660 --> 46:25.380]  And on his own he watches none.
[46:25.380 --> 46:27.180]  It's only like when we're as a family
[46:27.180 --> 46:30.540]  and we decide to watch something that he is exposed to.
[46:30.540 --> 46:32.900]  And I honestly, I don't think he understands
[46:32.900 --> 46:35.180]  the concept of a channel.
[46:35.180 --> 46:36.460]  I really don't because it's,
[46:36.460 --> 46:38.420]  even when we do watch broadcast TV,
[46:38.420 --> 46:39.940]  it's all through the TiVo.
[46:39.940 --> 46:41.540]  Like I've talked to him,
[46:41.540 --> 46:44.100]  I just, I don't think he really understands the idea
[46:44.100 --> 46:47.500]  of when you get cable TV, you have,
[46:47.500 --> 46:49.980]  here's your 80 channels to choose from.
[46:49.980 --> 46:51.540]  And-
[46:51.540 --> 46:53.700]  And you have to watch what you're watching
[46:53.700 --> 46:54.820]  when they put it on.
[46:54.820 --> 46:55.940]  I think that's the big thing,
[46:55.940 --> 46:58.460]  like the lack of on demand, that's the concept.
[46:58.460 --> 47:01.100]  I mean, my daughter's gonna have no concept of that at all.
[47:01.100 --> 47:04.060]  Because even when we let her watch stuff on her iPad,
[47:04.060 --> 47:06.060]  like usually when we're sitting with her,
[47:06.060 --> 47:07.780]  if she wants to watch something,
[47:07.780 --> 47:09.460]  we'll let her watch a movie.
[47:09.460 --> 47:11.780]  And if she's watching a movie,
[47:11.780 --> 47:13.820]  that movie, I found this very interesting
[47:13.820 --> 47:14.940]  because I'm a movie freak,
[47:14.940 --> 47:16.420]  but that movie is,
[47:17.340 --> 47:20.140]  the temporal aspects of it are permeable to her.
[47:20.140 --> 47:20.980]  In other words,
[47:20.980 --> 47:23.540]  she just watches the bits that she wants to watch.
[47:23.540 --> 47:24.980]  Sometimes she'll watch it all the way through.
[47:24.980 --> 47:26.500]  If we put it on the TV,
[47:26.500 --> 47:27.980]  in other words, if you use like the Apple TV
[47:27.980 --> 47:29.220]  to put it on the TV,
[47:29.220 --> 47:30.540]  she'll watch it beginning to end.
[47:30.540 --> 47:32.700]  And she loves movies, which I'm very happy about.
[47:32.700 --> 47:34.540]  She's been asking me to watch Batman,
[47:34.540 --> 47:37.340]  which I'm patting myself on the back about.
[47:37.340 --> 47:40.380]  The Keaton Batman, not some cartoon, anyhow.
[47:40.380 --> 47:41.700]  And she's three, I probably shouldn't,
[47:41.700 --> 47:43.740]  but let's just leave that parenting discussion
[47:43.740 --> 47:44.580]  to another day.
[47:45.380 --> 47:50.380]  But that linearity of the movie,
[47:50.620 --> 47:52.260]  she just jumps back and forth, right?
[47:52.260 --> 47:54.340]  She'll watch the bits that she wants to watch.
[47:54.340 --> 47:55.860]  If there's something scary, she'll skip it.
[47:55.860 --> 47:57.900]  If there's something that a funny bit
[47:57.900 --> 47:58.940]  that she wants to watch again,
[47:58.940 --> 48:01.100]  she just drags her finger across the slider
[48:01.100 --> 48:02.140]  and she comes back.
[48:02.140 --> 48:04.700]  So it's not only the lack of channels,
[48:04.700 --> 48:06.300]  the on-demand nature,
[48:06.300 --> 48:08.540]  but also the linearity of it,
[48:08.540 --> 48:11.460]  where we were used to watching something
[48:11.460 --> 48:14.780]  that lasted an hour and we were happy about it on VHS.
[48:14.780 --> 48:17.140]  And then we rewind it and watch it again or whatever.
[48:17.140 --> 48:18.820]  But that is gone, gone, gone.
[48:18.820 --> 48:21.980]  And Vine is a part of that because it's six seconds.
[48:21.980 --> 48:23.980]  And you build your own TV channel
[48:23.980 --> 48:25.740]  by following the people that you want
[48:25.740 --> 48:28.140]  and by telling it what you like
[48:28.140 --> 48:30.620]  and letting it build a channel for you, things like that.
[48:30.620 --> 48:32.060]  And then that's your TV.
[48:32.060 --> 48:34.460]  You watch Vine for 10 minutes, right?
[48:34.460 --> 48:37.540]  And you watch somebody's creations,
[48:37.540 --> 48:39.900]  watch a bunch of these creations tied together.
[48:39.900 --> 48:42.660]  And that's a quote-unquote program
[48:42.660 --> 48:45.260]  that's been built for you out of your tastes.
[48:45.260 --> 48:47.260]  And so when it comes time to tell them,
[48:47.260 --> 48:50.260]  oh, no, no, you're supposed to let somebody else determine
[48:50.260 --> 48:52.700]  what you were supposed to watch and supposed to like,
[48:52.700 --> 48:54.620]  and you're supposed to let them do that for hours on end,
[48:54.620 --> 48:55.460]  I just think that's gonna be
[48:55.460 --> 48:57.420]  an incredibly tough concept for them.
[48:57.420 --> 49:01.220]  Yeah, so tons of money, enormous celebrity,
[49:01.220 --> 49:05.380]  and it's all happening on YouTube and Vine.
[49:05.380 --> 49:07.100]  And I thought it was very, very interesting.
[49:07.100 --> 49:10.340]  I mean, clearly, I don't think Vine is as big as YouTube
[49:11.220 --> 49:13.540]  in any sense, even in the literal sense
[49:13.540 --> 49:15.100]  of how long the videos can be.
[49:16.340 --> 49:20.540]  But the way that Vine featured so prominently
[49:20.540 --> 49:23.820]  in this story of these VidCon celebrities
[49:23.820 --> 49:25.460]  and the fans who follow them
[49:25.460 --> 49:27.060]  really opened my eyes to the fact
[49:27.060 --> 49:29.900]  that Twitter has a real gem by owning them,
[49:29.900 --> 49:31.420]  whether they've figured out a way to make money
[49:31.420 --> 49:32.620]  from Vine or not.
[49:32.620 --> 49:37.180]  It just re-emphasizes my circling back to these,
[49:37.180 --> 49:39.620]  hey, if their stock keeps circling down,
[49:39.620 --> 49:40.620]  somebody is gonna buy them
[49:40.620 --> 49:42.140]  because somebody is gonna see
[49:42.140 --> 49:44.380]  that this is a tremendous thing to own.
[49:46.260 --> 49:50.780]  Right, and will they then keep the reasons
[49:50.780 --> 49:53.900]  why it is tremendous and sort of improve it,
[49:53.900 --> 49:55.460]  or will they screw it up?
[49:55.460 --> 49:57.860]  Right, I mean, and look at Facebook and Instagram.
[49:57.860 --> 50:01.660]  There's one where I love Instagram, really do.
[50:01.660 --> 50:03.420]  Instagram is one of the few social things
[50:03.420 --> 50:05.140]  that I use, really like it.
[50:05.140 --> 50:07.180]  And when Facebook bought them, my heart sunk
[50:07.180 --> 50:08.500]  because I thought this is,
[50:09.540 --> 50:10.860]  because I don't even use Facebook.
[50:10.860 --> 50:11.860]  I don't use Facebook.
[50:11.860 --> 50:13.540]  I really don't see the appeal of it.
[50:13.540 --> 50:16.620]  I don't like lots of things about it.
[50:16.620 --> 50:17.700]  They're gonna wreck it.
[50:17.700 --> 50:20.540]  And if I didn't know that Facebook bought Instagram,
[50:21.700 --> 50:24.060]  as of today, years down the road,
[50:24.060 --> 50:26.460]  I would have no idea.
[50:26.460 --> 50:28.700]  They don't force any kind of Facebook sign-in.
[50:30.140 --> 50:33.900]  It's everything, every way that the app
[50:33.900 --> 50:36.140]  and the platform have evolved since then
[50:36.140 --> 50:40.700]  have been all, to me, just purely Instagrammy,
[50:40.700 --> 50:43.100]  you know, to make up an adjective.
[50:43.100 --> 50:45.500]  It all feels true to what it wanted to be.
[50:45.500 --> 50:48.260]  Right, I mean, I'm a big fan of Instagram, too,
[50:48.260 --> 50:49.820]  and I think a lot of it comes from the fact
[50:49.820 --> 50:54.820]  that Mark Zuckerberg did leave Kevin's system in charge,
[50:54.820 --> 50:59.140]  and he gave him sort of the ability to execute
[50:59.140 --> 51:02.020]  on the plans that he had already had with minimal fuss.
[51:02.020 --> 51:04.460]  And I think that Kevin's actually a pretty good thinker
[51:04.460 --> 51:06.580]  in terms of the stuff he cares.
[51:06.580 --> 51:10.260]  It's not a situation where he's trying to maximize
[51:11.380 --> 51:13.780]  his ROI from the users at every turn.
[51:13.780 --> 51:15.540]  Instead, it's what's right.
[51:15.540 --> 51:18.500]  And there are people that are able to do that,
[51:18.500 --> 51:20.980]  but there's very few people who are able to do that
[51:20.980 --> 51:23.980]  in the face of billions of dollars worth of,
[51:23.980 --> 51:27.140]  you know, money and revenue and everything else, right?
[51:27.140 --> 51:28.900]  So he's part of Facebook now,
[51:28.900 --> 51:31.940]  but still has managed to carve out a very unique spot
[51:31.940 --> 51:36.060]  for Instagram and keep it good, which is a great thing.
[51:37.100 --> 51:40.060]  Why the hell do you think they don't have a native iPad app?
[51:41.100 --> 51:43.500]  Focus, I mean, I think it's about focus.
[51:43.500 --> 51:45.180]  I think that they, I mean, obviously,
[51:45.180 --> 51:46.620]  they have all the engineering resources
[51:46.620 --> 51:48.020]  they could ever want, right?
[51:48.020 --> 51:50.300]  So they could hire 50 engineers today
[51:50.300 --> 51:52.300]  to build a great native iPad app,
[51:52.300 --> 51:54.700]  and it would display our Instagram photos and everything.
[51:54.700 --> 51:56.940]  So it's not that they don't have the resources.
[51:56.940 --> 52:00.300]  I think it's a matter of focus in terms of the,
[52:00.300 --> 52:03.580]  Instagram works for a variety of reasons,
[52:03.580 --> 52:05.180]  but one of the major reasons it works
[52:05.180 --> 52:08.980]  is actually because of the way it's physically structured,
[52:08.980 --> 52:10.620]  the way the feed works.
[52:10.620 --> 52:12.020]  You scroll one picture at a time,
[52:12.020 --> 52:14.260]  you look at one thing at a time, it scrolls by.
[52:14.260 --> 52:16.540]  And I mean, I've used, as I'm sure you have,
[52:16.540 --> 52:19.580]  I've used like a half dozen different iPad apps
[52:19.580 --> 52:20.500]  to browse Instagram,
[52:20.500 --> 52:22.340]  because sometimes I'm like, you know, I'm on my iPad,
[52:22.340 --> 52:24.540]  I just want to look at what's new on Instagram.
[52:24.540 --> 52:27.860]  And that's fine, but it does not feel anywhere near
[52:27.860 --> 52:28.980]  as compelling.
[52:28.980 --> 52:30.980]  You're sort of presented with a bunch of pictures
[52:30.980 --> 52:34.220]  that feel less valuable, all in a grid, right?
[52:34.220 --> 52:36.860]  Whereas when you're scrolling down your Instagram feed,
[52:36.860 --> 52:39.220]  each one feels like it has merit and value,
[52:39.220 --> 52:42.180]  and sure, you may scroll by it quickly
[52:42.180 --> 52:43.380]  because you're not interested,
[52:43.380 --> 52:44.740]  but the ones you are interested,
[52:44.740 --> 52:46.300]  they take up your whole screen,
[52:46.300 --> 52:48.340]  they feel very front and center.
[52:48.340 --> 52:50.540]  So will they do it? Probably,
[52:50.540 --> 52:53.180]  but I can understand the reluctance, you know?
[52:54.580 --> 52:56.340]  The way I would imagine doing it,
[52:56.340 --> 52:58.700]  and I know that in general for most apps,
[52:59.820 --> 53:02.620]  take your iPhone design and just blow it up
[53:02.620 --> 53:06.300]  to fit the iPad screen is not a good design
[53:06.300 --> 53:08.180]  for an iPad app.
[53:08.180 --> 53:11.980]  I think Instagram is a rare case where it might be,
[53:11.980 --> 53:15.620]  you know, and make it so that, you know,
[53:15.620 --> 53:17.100]  maybe even just like the phone,
[53:17.100 --> 53:19.460]  make it so that it doesn't rotate,
[53:19.460 --> 53:21.780]  make it so that you have to hold the iPad vertically
[53:21.780 --> 53:24.340]  and you just scroll down and they fit,
[53:24.340 --> 53:26.380]  and that way it just makes the photos bigger.
[53:26.380 --> 53:27.220]  That's-
[53:27.220 --> 53:28.780]  Right. I wonder, and I have no idea,
[53:28.780 --> 53:29.620]  but I wonder-
[53:29.620 --> 53:30.460]  On the other hand-
[53:30.460 --> 53:32.140]  They just moved to high res photos.
[53:32.140 --> 53:32.980]  Right.
[53:32.980 --> 53:36.300]  So I wonder that it's been such crappy res for so long
[53:36.300 --> 53:39.380]  has stopped them and now they moved up in preparation.
[53:39.380 --> 53:40.220]  I've thought that too.
[53:40.220 --> 53:42.700]  Maybe, yeah, maybe it's just because, you know,
[53:42.700 --> 53:44.460]  that the resolution wasn't yet big enough.
[53:44.460 --> 53:46.620]  They have to, you know, and they did that recently.
[53:46.620 --> 53:47.660]  They've increased the size.
[53:47.660 --> 53:48.500]  What is the new size?
[53:48.500 --> 53:49.340]  Is it like a-
[53:50.700 --> 53:51.540]  Good question.
[53:51.540 --> 53:54.020]  I think it's like 2048 by 2488 or something like that.
[53:54.020 --> 53:54.860]  Yeah, which is-
[53:54.860 --> 53:55.680]  It's pretty big.
[53:55.680 --> 53:57.060]  Pretty big, at least compared to where they were.
[53:57.060 --> 54:00.300]  And it's certainly big enough to make a fine JPEG on,
[54:01.620 --> 54:04.500]  that would actually be pixel for pixel, I think, on-
[54:04.500 --> 54:05.860]  On the iPad, yeah.
[54:07.060 --> 54:09.580]  Which may be a coincidence or maybe not a coincidence.
[54:09.580 --> 54:10.940]  Right, right.
[54:10.940 --> 54:12.980]  My only other thought is maybe they've tried it
[54:12.980 --> 54:14.860]  and that it just doesn't feel right.
[54:14.860 --> 54:17.420]  And I'm imagining that it would feel just great,
[54:17.420 --> 54:18.500]  but that it doesn't.
[54:18.500 --> 54:19.540]  So maybe, I don't know.
[54:19.540 --> 54:20.740]  But at this point-
[54:20.740 --> 54:22.380]  I mean, if they haven't tried it,
[54:22.380 --> 54:24.100]  I would be incredibly shocked.
[54:24.100 --> 54:25.780]  So whether it feels right or not, I don't know.
[54:25.780 --> 54:27.140]  They've obviously tried it.
[54:27.140 --> 54:28.980]  So I don't know why we haven't seen it.
[54:31.280 --> 54:32.980]  Sorry, but yeah, as far as going, you know,
[54:32.980 --> 54:36.420]  companies staying whole inside other companies,
[54:36.420 --> 54:37.820]  I think that's a good example.
[54:37.820 --> 54:42.780]  But as to what company's culture works for that,
[54:42.780 --> 54:43.700]  you know, it's very few.
[54:43.700 --> 54:46.900]  I mean, you could feasibly see Facebook buying them
[54:46.900 --> 54:48.900]  and leaving them alone, right?
[54:48.900 --> 54:51.140]  Like that, they have proven, obviously,
[54:51.140 --> 54:53.340]  that they have the ability to do that
[54:53.340 --> 54:56.340]  and not take it as like a matter of pride
[54:56.340 --> 54:57.940]  that they have to muck with it.
[54:57.940 --> 54:59.740]  Because I think that sometimes it just comes down to that.
[54:59.740 --> 55:01.540]  You think that Silicon Valley is super rational
[55:01.540 --> 55:04.300]  and all this stuff, but you know, ego plays a part.
[55:04.300 --> 55:05.340]  People are human.
[55:05.340 --> 55:06.940]  So you get these egos in there who are like,
[55:06.940 --> 55:09.300]  oh no, I gotta put my stamp on this thing.
[55:09.300 --> 55:11.260]  And they muck it up.
[55:11.260 --> 55:14.980]  So you could conceivably see Facebook as a company
[55:14.980 --> 55:16.620]  who's already proven that, you know,
[55:16.620 --> 55:20.980]  Mark or whoever, whatever PM is in charge of those products
[55:20.980 --> 55:24.500]  doesn't have that ego-driven approach.
[55:24.500 --> 55:26.340]  And you can say, hey, maybe they could buy it
[55:26.340 --> 55:27.460]  and leave it alone, you know?
[55:27.460 --> 55:28.860]  And they certainly have the money.
[55:28.860 --> 55:30.860]  It's just a matter of whether or not
[55:30.860 --> 55:32.860]  it fits with their overall strategy.
[55:32.860 --> 55:35.260]  But given that they've got,
[55:35.260 --> 55:37.140]  I mean, before they bought WhatsApp,
[55:37.140 --> 55:40.500]  I would have probably had a far less inclination
[55:40.500 --> 55:41.900]  to say that they'd buy it.
[55:41.900 --> 55:43.460]  But now that they've bought WhatsApp,
[55:43.460 --> 55:46.300]  it's definitely actually more of a possibility to me.
[55:46.300 --> 55:49.540]  I, yeah, to me, the top, it's, if I had to bet,
[55:49.540 --> 55:54.540]  it would be a bidding war between Facebook and Google.
[55:54.820 --> 55:58.380]  And Facebook, to me, it almost seems a little more likely.
[55:58.380 --> 56:02.260]  Because maybe Google's a little gun-shy now about social.
[56:03.820 --> 56:04.660]  I don't know.
[56:04.660 --> 56:05.500]  I don't know, maybe.
[56:05.500 --> 56:07.220]  I mean, when Vic and Gondotra left,
[56:07.220 --> 56:09.740]  they lost all direction on Google+.
[56:09.740 --> 56:13.180]  And I think Vic, I don't know why Vic left
[56:13.180 --> 56:15.860]  and I'm not going to make assumptions
[56:15.860 --> 56:17.740]  that I don't know Jack about.
[56:17.740 --> 56:20.300]  But I do know that they have been planning
[56:20.300 --> 56:22.220]  to do the stuff that they did with Google+,
[56:22.220 --> 56:23.180]  for like a year.
[56:23.180 --> 56:24.980]  You know, the spinning out of photos
[56:24.980 --> 56:27.460]  and removing it from a lot of their primary products
[56:27.460 --> 56:28.680]  and stuff like that.
[56:28.680 --> 56:30.120]  We reported on that a year ago.
[56:30.120 --> 56:32.700]  And people obviously got really mad at us
[56:32.700 --> 56:33.700]  and told us we were lying.
[56:33.700 --> 56:36.220]  I mean, the Google+, freaks came out in droves.
[56:36.220 --> 56:39.420]  But it was totally, 100% accurate what we reported
[56:39.420 --> 56:40.580]  they were planning on doing.
[56:40.580 --> 56:42.100]  And it was the right move.
[56:42.100 --> 56:43.580]  Because it felt intrusive.
[56:43.580 --> 56:44.540]  It wasn't working.
[56:44.540 --> 56:47.300]  It wasn't providing them any social uplift
[56:47.300 --> 56:48.660]  on the usage of their products.
[56:48.660 --> 56:52.740]  And it actually did do what it needed to do,
[56:52.740 --> 56:54.820]  which is create a single sign-on service that
[56:54.820 --> 56:58.220]  allowed them to get more users using Google products,
[56:58.220 --> 57:00.620]  especially search, while signed in.
[57:00.620 --> 57:02.200]  Because not only can they provide them
[57:02.200 --> 57:03.820]  a better experience through Google Now,
[57:03.820 --> 57:07.540]  which is freaking fantastic, but they can also, of course,
[57:07.540 --> 57:10.060]  serve them more accurate ads and gather more data on them.
[57:10.060 --> 57:12.580]  And whether you feel great about that or not is up to you.
[57:12.580 --> 57:15.740]  But that was the thought process.
[57:15.740 --> 57:16.980]  And that worked.
[57:16.980 --> 57:20.780]  As far as the social stuff, that was like Vic's brainchild.
[57:20.780 --> 57:23.940]  So I think when he left, and whether it
[57:23.940 --> 57:25.860]  was causation, correlation, I don't know.
[57:25.860 --> 57:27.700]  What caused what?
[57:27.700 --> 57:30.740]  But when he left, that stopped.
[57:30.740 --> 57:33.220]  That was done as of that moment.
[57:33.220 --> 57:35.460]  So I don't think that it was necessarily
[57:35.460 --> 57:37.180]  that they're turned off by it.
[57:37.180 --> 57:39.460]  Because sure, it cost them a bunch of money,
[57:39.460 --> 57:41.100]  but they have a bunch of money.
[57:41.100 --> 57:43.780]  And I think it was worth it.
[57:43.780 --> 57:45.860]  I mean, there's no way to calculate it.
[57:45.860 --> 57:48.620]  But I'm sure somebody at Google has done the math and said,
[57:48.620 --> 57:52.900]  well, we got 800 million more signed in users
[57:52.900 --> 57:55.860]  or whatever over the course of a year or two years.
[57:55.860 --> 57:57.180]  And that's totally worth it.
[57:57.180 --> 57:59.220]  It way offsets the money that we spent.
[57:59.220 --> 57:59.780]  I don't know.
[57:59.780 --> 58:01.780]  Somebody there has probably done some math.
[58:01.780 --> 58:04.340]  But aside from all the math aspect,
[58:04.340 --> 58:09.100]  I think that they didn't see that as their bid
[58:09.100 --> 58:10.260]  to combat Facebook.
[58:10.260 --> 58:13.300]  And that's where you get in these arguments about people
[58:13.300 --> 58:14.980]  that are like, no, they're trying to beat Facebook.
[58:14.980 --> 58:16.900]  And I never, ever thought it was about that.
[58:16.900 --> 58:19.300]  I don't think anybody who was really, really smart
[58:19.300 --> 58:21.700]  thought it was about them beating Facebook or whatever
[58:21.700 --> 58:22.500]  the case.
[58:22.500 --> 58:25.060]  It sort of was about other people
[58:25.060 --> 58:28.580]  owning the social channel and all the data involved.
[58:28.580 --> 58:31.380]  And so they didn't want to be left out in the cold on that.
[58:31.380 --> 58:33.420]  But I think that if you look at it that way,
[58:33.420 --> 58:34.900]  then you could say, oh, well, they
[58:34.900 --> 58:38.180]  could try again with a different thing, like Twitter maybe.
[58:38.180 --> 58:40.620]  And maybe they get all the data that they
[58:40.620 --> 58:45.140]  need from Twitter without having to actually tell anybody,
[58:45.140 --> 58:47.100]  oh, you've got to log into Google.
[58:47.100 --> 58:49.860]  And I think that if you go back to Twitter being
[58:49.860 --> 58:53.060]  a real-time component of the web,
[58:53.060 --> 58:55.620]  then it becomes much more clear why
[58:55.620 --> 58:57.700]  they might want it versus, oh, it's
[58:57.700 --> 58:59.820]  their new social initiative.
[58:59.820 --> 59:02.340]  Instead, it's, oh, it's a pillar of the internet.
[59:02.340 --> 59:05.380]  And Google's all, I mean, search is another pillar.
[59:05.380 --> 59:09.140]  So if search is one pillar and real-time is another pillar,
[59:09.140 --> 59:12.340]  then they've got two out of whatever, however many.
[59:12.340 --> 59:14.700]  I don't know, I'm not going to count them offhand now.
[59:14.700 --> 59:16.900]  But there are several things that sort of have
[59:16.900 --> 59:18.540]  to exist for the web to exist.
[59:18.540 --> 59:20.660]  And obviously, searching and indexing is one of them.
[59:20.660 --> 59:22.140]  And Google's got that.
[59:22.140 --> 59:24.060]  And if real-time is another one and they
[59:24.060 --> 59:25.780]  see this as an opportunity to grab that,
[59:25.780 --> 59:27.100]  that's why I think they buy it.
[59:27.100 --> 59:28.220]  Not for social, necessarily.
[59:28.220 --> 59:29.380]  I agree.
[59:29.380 --> 59:32.260]  And I think it makes total sense, for example.
[59:32.260 --> 59:33.660]  And I don't think it was rushed.
[59:33.660 --> 59:36.020]  I think it's so polished and it makes so much sense.
[59:36.020 --> 59:38.580]  But just the way that they've spun Google Photos
[59:38.580 --> 59:42.020]  into a standalone product, it just makes pure sense.
[59:42.020 --> 59:47.420]  And it is good for people who are in the Google ecosystem.
[59:47.420 --> 59:52.260]  Here, you sign up for this thing and you install this app.
[59:52.260 --> 59:54.380]  Or maybe if you're on an Android phone,
[59:54.380 --> 59:55.580]  the app is already there.
[59:55.580 --> 59:58.220]  And you sign in with your Google account.
[59:58.220 --> 01:00:02.660]  And now all of your photos are in this one thing.
[01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:03.700]  Here's where they all are.
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.060]  And they're on all your devices.
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:10.220]  And we're going to do these compelling AI recognition
[01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:13.660]  things on the content of the photos.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:16.140]  And then that's more or less the end of the story, right?
[01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:17.540]  And then you can search for them.
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:20.420]  And you can say, they've got these cool features
[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:22.860]  where you can search for things like wind,
[01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:26.820]  and it'll find pictures, or snow, or something.
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:28.660]  It sounds almost too good to be true.
[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:33.780]  And a lot of people, it seems to work really well in reality.
[01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:35.540]  And that's the end of the story.
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:39.900]  Well, that makes sense to awful, regular people.
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:41.940]  That just, you know, it's a compelling.
[01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:44.140]  Value proposition is clear.
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:47.220]  And it just was never the case when photos
[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:49.500]  were wrapped up in Google+.
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:52.980]  It always seemed like it was a little bit like Facebook,
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:55.420]  and a little bit like a photo library, and a little bit,
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:58.980]  you know, and a little bit of this, and a little bit of that,
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:02.460]  and trying to be more than one thing, as opposed to, here,
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:05.980]  Google Photos, all of your photos, it's just like Gmail,
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:07.380]  like what Gmail is to your email.
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:09.900]  Here's a thing that's like that to your photo library.
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:12.580]  There it is.
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:14.620]  Anyway, speaking of photos, let me take a break here
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:18.140]  and thank our presenters for joining us today.
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:21.820]  Let me take a break here and thank our second sponsor,
[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:25.380]  and it is our good friends at Fracture.
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:28.060]  So we've been talking about digital photos.
[01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:29.940]  Fracture is all about taking your photos
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:32.500]  and making them analog, right?
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:33.820]  You take your photos and memories
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:36.980]  that are trapped somewhere, way down in your Instagram feed,
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:39.300]  or they're in your iCloud photo library,
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.860]  or Google Photos, or whatever.
[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:43.220]  And all you ever do is see them on your phone,
[01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:44.820]  or on your tablet, or something like that.
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:47.620]  You see them on these screens.
[01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:50.180]  You get to have your photos in the real world,
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:51.500]  hanging on your wall.
[01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.060]  Put them up, you know, hang them on a wall,
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:56.460]  going up the steps, put them on the shelf in your office,
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:59.660]  put them on your desk, somewhere where they're tangible
[01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:02.740]  and analog with the photos that mean the most to you.
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:08.220]  What Fracture does, and if you listen to the show regularly,
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:09.380]  you've heard me talk about it before,
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:14.140]  they take your photos and they print them directly on glass.
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:15.700]  It's not a piece of paper stuck to glass.
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:18.900]  I don't know, they've got some kind of magic process
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.140]  where they take glass,
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:22.740]  and that's what the actual image is printed on.
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:26.020]  It is a very, very compelling physical artifact.
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:27.460]  It is really, really great.
[01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:31.940]  I don't know what to say,
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:33.100]  because they keep sponsoring the show.
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:34.740]  Here's the thing, they've written to me.
[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:35.820]  They keep sponsoring the show.
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:38.580]  People keep going there, following my advice,
[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:40.340]  doing this, and buying Fractures,
[01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:41.860]  and then they keep buying more.
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:43.100]  It's like, you might think,
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:45.700]  how come every single week I listen to this show,
[01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:47.700]  Fracture is sponsoring the show?
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:50.340]  I worry that it gets repetitive, but here's the thing.
[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:51.860]  People keep buying these photos,
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:53.980]  and I can't say enough good things.
[01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:56.100]  I mean it sincerely.
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:57.860]  Even if they said, you know what, we love you.
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:59.980]  You've brought us so many great customers,
[01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:02.580]  but we're not gonna sponsor the show for a while.
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:04.020]  I would still recommend Fracture
[01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:06.420]  to anybody who wants to get photos printed.
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:08.060]  You wanna get your photos printed.
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:09.580]  It's just great.
[01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:10.860]  It is so fantastic.
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:11.700]  Go there, check them out.
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:15.620]  They have sizes that range from little,
[01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:17.660]  I don't know, like a three by three or four by four,
[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:21.380]  all the way up to massive, like 23 by 27 inch,
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:23.940]  really, really big, big pieces of glass.
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:26.500]  Go to, here's where you go.
[01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:31.300]  Their website is fractureme.com,
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:35.140]  and the code is daringfireball,
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:39.220]  and that's good for 15% off your first order,
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:41.620]  and their prices are already great,
[01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:43.940]  so you're saving money on what's already a great deal.
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:45.260]  So go to fractureme.com,
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:46.940]  and remember the code, daringfireball,
[01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:48.660]  and if you haven't yet,
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:50.500]  go print out a couple of your photos
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:53.260]  from your vacation or whatever you've done this summer.
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:54.980]  My thanks to them.
[01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:59.380]  Did you ever take a photograph?
[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:03.860]  Yeah, I've taken one or two.
[01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:05.580]  I used to be a professional photographer
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:07.100]  in my previous life.
[01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:09.980]  What do you think?
[01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:11.580]  I knew that was a loaded question.
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:13.700]  What are your opinions?
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:14.740]  Well, here's where I'm going with it.
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:17.780]  I'm gonna parlay from the Fracture thing
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:21.300]  to talking about the Photos app for Mac,
[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:26.540]  which I'm sort of formulating my opinion on.
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:28.380]  I'm a very slow thinker in general.
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:30.620]  I don't know if you've ever noticed that, but.
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:31.460]  You're deliberate.
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:33.060]  Let's say you're deliberate.
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:38.060]  I, for years, used Lightroom,
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:43.740]  and I actually still have, for all of those years,
[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:47.740]  my photo library from those years is all in Lightroom.
[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:54.100]  But to kind of force myself
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:59.100]  to give photos a really good try,
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:04.100]  I don't have Lightroom installed on my Retina iMac yet.
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:06.620]  I'm actually about to, at some point this summer,
[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:09.300]  I'm going to break down and go back to Lightroom,
[01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:11.460]  but at least just to have my library there.
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:17.820]  And a Twitter conversation I had with Dr. Wave from Pixar.
[01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:24.660]  Yeah, Michael.
[01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:25.860]  Yeah, Michael Johnson,
[01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:30.860]  who is, he's a better photographer than I am,
[01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:35.500]  but it's similar to me, where we're not pros.
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:38.460]  He does software at Pixar,
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:40.020]  but we actually even have the same camera.
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:45.020]  We have a similar liking for fast prime lenses,
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.580]  and we just shoot the same way,
[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:50.740]  which is the way you get a couple of good photos
[01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:52.180]  is if you're gonna take a nice camera,
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:54.100]  you shoot lots and lots and lots and lots
[01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:55.380]  and lots and lots of photos,
[01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:56.860]  and then you import them,
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:06:01.860]  and you find, literally, you just throw most of them away,
[01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:03.420]  find the keepers.
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:05.020]  In the old days, we used to say film is cheap,
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:06.780]  but that no longer applies.
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:08.580]  It actually applies even more now, but.
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:11.260]  Right, and if you watch what,
[01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:12.780]  I've talked about this a couple of weeks ago,
[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:16.300]  where it's like I cannot wait for professional photographers
[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.140]  to switch to mirrorless cameras,
[01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:21.860]  because I find it so annoying at news events,
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:26.700]  sports, or when the president of the United States
[01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:28.980]  is making a statement or something like that,
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:30.780]  and you hear the professional photographers,
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:33.260]  it's this machine gun, clack, clack, clack, clack,
[01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:37.500]  like just shooting however fast their cameras
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:38.340]  can go per second,
[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:41.220]  which is getting to be extraordinarily fast,
[01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:44.260]  10, 12 shots per second nonstop.
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:45.740]  Oh, yeah.
[01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:46.580]  To get what?
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:49.220]  One photo to accompany a news story,
[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:52.140]  but that's what you do, because digital's cheap.
[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:54.980]  Anyway, to me, Lightroom has all sorts of features
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:58.420]  that are meant to support that sort of workflow,
[01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:01.220]  where you can just go through and just,
[01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:02.980]  I forget the key if it's X or whatever,
[01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:04.140]  but you don't even have a modifier.
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:05.460]  You just keep going arrow, arrow,
[01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:07.780]  and you can just mark photos for deletion,
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:08.620]  and it doesn't even spend.
[01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:10.740]  Yeah, a bracket, I think, is the default,
[01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:12.020]  but you may have changed it.
[01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:13.260]  Yeah, I don't remember what the,
[01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:14.660]  I'd have to look it up, but,
[01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:18.260]  more or less, my workflow,
[01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:20.020]  and maybe there's other ways to do it,
[01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:23.860]  is you import, let's say, 300 photos into Lightroom,
[01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:26.180]  and you just start going through them,
[01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:29.700]  and you find, my first cut is to just throw out
[01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:31.100]  the ones I don't even wanna bother with,
[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:32.900]  and I just go through with arrow keys
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:34.460]  to go through the photos,
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:36.820]  and one key to just mark for deletion,
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:38.020]  and it doesn't even delete them.
[01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:41.460]  It's like a special flag, like you want to delete this,
[01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:42.940]  and it dims out the photo,
[01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:45.140]  but that way, you're not waiting for the disc
[01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:46.060]  to do anything.
[01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:48.780]  It's just like a little, one little piece of metadata
[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:51.700]  in a database, and you can go really, really fast,
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:52.540]  and Lightroom, you know, is.
[01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:53.820]  Yeah, yeah, that is X, I'm sorry.
[01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:56.380]  I was thinking of star rating, but yeah, you're right.
[01:07:56.380 --> 01:07:57.580]  Yeah, it's X, right?
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:00.780]  It's, and it makes, it's, the mnemonic is easy.
[01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:02.460]  It's like you're Xing out the photos,
[01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:04.500]  and it's like the real world version
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.460]  of you have a big stack of photos,
[01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:08.260]  and you just start flipping through,
[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:11.300]  and you put them in two columns, keepers,
[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:12.820]  and here's the trash can.
[01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:14.300]  Well, I mean, you literally used to do that
[01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:15.140]  with a context sheet.
[01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:16.620]  You would just X out the ones you didn't want,
[01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:18.420]  so you didn't bother looking at them again.
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:19.980]  Exactly, right, that would be the old way,
[01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:21.260]  would be the context sheet, right,
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:23.380]  and it's, you know, and if you've ever watched,
[01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:24.900]  you know, or you probably did it
[01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:25.820]  since you were shooting film,
[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:27.540]  and you were, you know, actually a pro,
[01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:29.220]  you know, you'd have like a grease pencil,
[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:30.780]  and just literally X them out.
[01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:36.180]  Bottom line for me is the problem with photos
[01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:37.900]  is there's no way to do that.
[01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:40.180]  It's photos to me is fun,
[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:41.780]  this is the insight I've come to,
[01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:44.580]  is that photos is fundamentally built around
[01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:47.380]  a much more consumer-minded mindset,
[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:49.580]  which is that most of the photos you take,
[01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:52.820]  you wanna keep, and, you know,
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:56.540]  whether that's based on coming from the phone world,
[01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:57.820]  you know, where you don't,
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:08:59.540]  even though you can do burst mode,
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:01.380]  and, you know, which is amazing.
[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:03.260]  Yeah, if that's their thinking, they're wrong,
[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:06.060]  because, I'm sorry, but if you look at, like,
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:10.140]  my daughter's iPod, she's got 150,000 selfies on it,
[01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:11.860]  and I don't think that's ever gonna change,
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:12.780]  you know what I mean?
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:16.540]  I think that the selfie thing for sure, for sure,
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:18.660]  is something where people take a ton of photos
[01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:21.100]  before they find one that they like,
[01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:22.540]  and I've seen my wife do it, you know,
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:24.060]  and she's not even a huge selfie taker,
[01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:25.540]  she's not, you know, super into that,
[01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:27.060]  but every once in a while she likes to,
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:28.180]  and send it to her friends,
[01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:29.380]  like, she got makeup on, and like,
[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:30.900]  oh, I tried this new thing,
[01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:33.940]  but she takes a ton, and then picks one, right?
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:37.140]  But she still takes that ton, so yeah, I agree,
[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:39.780]  I mean, I think that it's not just pros,
[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:41.300]  I think a lot of people do that,
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:43.940]  and I think if they're thinking is,
[01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:46.460]  that is, people taking one precious photo,
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:48.500]  and being done, I think they're wrong,
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:51.500]  especially because phones shoot so fast now,
[01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:52.580]  you know, they used to just like,
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:54.980]  oh, getting one out of them was a chore,
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:56.780]  but now it's like, bam, bam, bam,
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:59.420]  as you mentioned with the burst and everything.
[01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:01.380]  Yeah, and it just doesn't support that,
[01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:03.900]  and I feel like, and the other thing too,
[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:05.780]  is I kind of feel like they should,
[01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:07.940]  not just should support it because I wanna use it,
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:11.260]  but they should support it because I feel like,
[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:13.100]  in my honest opinion, it's a good thing
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:17.100]  to encourage people to do, to take lots of photos,
[01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:20.540]  and that that's how you get one or two that are really good.
[01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:23.300]  Don't try to, if you wanna get like two really good photos
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:25.540]  from your kid's birthday party,
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:28.900]  don't sit there and try to aim up one or two good ones.
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:32.700]  Take 60, 70, 80 pictures, and then go look through them
[01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:34.220]  on as big a screen as you can get,
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:36.540]  and see which ones actually came out good,
[01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:40.420]  and I feel like the app just does not support that.
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:42.980]  I mean, one thing is that there's no way,
[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:45.500]  and this is on a new iMac, so it is,
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:48.940]  I wouldn't call it slow, and I don't have a huge library.
[01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:51.260]  I think I've got like 20,000 photos in there.
[01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:53.820]  So I wouldn't call it slow,
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:57.020]  and it imported my old iPhoto library fine,
[01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:59.900]  but it's not that fast,
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:02.380]  and it always seems to do the wrong thing when I delete.
[01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:05.060]  Like you actually just have to delete a photo to delete it,
[01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:07.660]  and just hitting the delete key doesn't work
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:09.780]  because that brings up a warning dialog.
[01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:10.660]  You sure you want to delete it,
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:13.820]  so you have to Command-Delete, which isn't too bad.
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:16.740]  Command-Delete isn't too bad, which is immediate,
[01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:21.100]  and it's not, the thing that annoys me about the delete key
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:23.820]  is that, bringing up a dialog every time,
[01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:28.820]  is that it doesn't wipe it off the disk.
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:31.340]  It moves it to a trash can type thing,
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:32.540]  where you could get it back,
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:34.860]  or you can do undo if you make a mistake,
[01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:38.340]  but even then, it often goes to the wrong photo.
[01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:39.820]  It doesn't go to the next photo.
[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:41.700]  It goes to the one I looked at before,
[01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:45.580]  and it doesn't seem, and I could be wrong here,
[01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:47.500]  but maybe I just want to go the wrong way.
[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:48.900]  Maybe I'm always trying to go,
[01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:50.980]  and it always wants you to go forward in time,
[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:52.340]  and I want to go backwards,
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:54.100]  from the most recent to the least recent.
[01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:57.380]  I don't know, but when you're in that mode,
[01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:00.620]  and you just want to fly through 100 pictures,
[01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:05.260]  it's annoying if you keep having to hit three or four keys,
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:08.580]  and arrow, and go back, and back, and back,
[01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:10.020]  over, and over, and over again.
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:11.460]  Right, right.
[01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:13.580]  Yeah, I do not think it is built
[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:15.020]  for that kind of editing at all,
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:17.700]  and there's a couple possibilities.
[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:21.220]  One possibility could be that we are 100% wrong,
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:22.820]  and that the data supports the fact
[01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:26.140]  that people take a few photos at a time, right?
[01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:28.420]  So if you look, if they're like,
[01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:30.820]  oh, well, you guys don't know what we know,
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:32.940]  and what we know is that data
[01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:35.860]  on millions and millions of users says
[01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:37.900]  that this is the way people shoot,
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:40.060]  and we serviced that with this product,
[01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:41.580]  and that you guys are the outliers,
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:43.220]  and you need to use Lightroom, right?
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:44.500]  So that's one possibility.
[01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:49.820]  The second possibility is that there is a disconnect
[01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:53.540]  between the team that is building photos,
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:56.020]  and the teams that built
[01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:58.660]  their professional photo products in the past.
[01:12:58.660 --> 01:12:59.940]  So from what I understand,
[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:04.820]  it's not like they took the Aperture team,
[01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:06.740]  and had them build photos.
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:08.980]  Like, those people scattered everywhere,
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:12.020]  and are building other things,
[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.260]  for better or for worse, you know?
[01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:15.740]  So if you took the institutional knowledge
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:19.140]  of the people building Aperture,
[01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:19.980]  and brought it in,
[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:21.420]  and they could then tell you,
[01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:24.700]  oh, man, if you want people to use this
[01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:27.060]  as any sort of core tool,
[01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:28.380]  you're gonna need to support people
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:31.420]  blasting through a bunch of pictures and editing them,
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:33.420]  then maybe that would have been built differently.
[01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:35.460]  But I don't know if that institutional knowledge was there.
[01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:36.980]  So that's another possibility.
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:38.780]  Well, what I heard,
[01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:40.740]  and I could be wrong.
[01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:42.180]  Well, I'm not wrong.
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:44.620]  I could be wrong just in a matter of degree,
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:48.220]  is that what's now called Photos for Mac,
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:49.340]  or just Photos,
[01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:53.140]  started life internally as iPhoto X.
[01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:57.500]  It was definitely not just the next version of iPhoto.
[01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.260]  It wasn't just a bump the integer.
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:01.100]  It was, you know, like when they've had
[01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:04.460]  these other products get an X or something like that,
[01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:05.500]  like with iMovie,
[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:10.220]  like where they kind of radically redid the concept of it.
[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:11.700]  It was a radical rewrite.
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:12.540]  It was a rewrite,
[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:15.020]  but it was a rewrite of iPhoto,
[01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:15.860]  you know, definitely,
[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:16.740]  and it was even by name.
[01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:18.460]  And it changed after, you know,
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:19.940]  from where that started,
[01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:23.300]  it did change where they strategically said,
[01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:26.340]  you know, iPhoto is the wrong way to go.
[01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:28.100]  What we really want to do is,
[01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:31.860]  you know, have this unified photo platform
[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:33.180]  across iOS and Mac.
[01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:34.940]  And so we should just do,
[01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:36.940]  you know, follow the lead of iOS
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:38.060]  and just call it Photos.
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:40.380]  And the design changed at that point, too,
[01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:43.060]  clearly, because it's clearly a sibling
[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:46.260]  to the iOS Photos app.
[01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:47.900]  Right.
[01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:48.900]  But I still think, though,
[01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:50.900]  that that shows in its roots,
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:51.740]  you know, because to me,
[01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:52.580]  that was the problem.
[01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:53.500]  I mean, years ago,
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:54.980]  why I didn't use iPhoto
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:56.940]  and, you know, taught myself
[01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:58.060]  to use Lightroom instead
[01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:00.180]  was that iPhoto to me was never,
[01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:02.540]  ever good for people who shot a lot of,
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:04.420]  you know, shot the way I shot.
[01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:05.540]  Mm-hmm.
[01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:08.740]  Yeah, Lightroom is my boy.
[01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:10.500]  Like, I love Lightroom or my girl,
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:11.340]  however you want to,
[01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.060]  I want to be correct about that.
[01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:14.780]  But I really, really like it.
[01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:17.700]  I mean, it's the easiest,
[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:19.620]  best tool that has come along
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:21.380]  for photographers in generations.
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:22.540]  And, you know, these days,
[01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:23.380]  there's lots of arguments
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:24.900]  about it getting stale and all this stuff,
[01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:26.580]  but I still think it's,
[01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:28.620]  it got exactly the right things right,
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:30.540]  which is you need to deal
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:32.460]  with complex adjustments
[01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:35.100]  in a way that allows you granularity of control.
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:36.060]  You know, you need to be able
[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:38.340]  to blast through and do an initial pass,
[01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:39.300]  and then you need to be able
[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:40.660]  to kind of diddle down
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:43.100]  and drill down into minute adjustments.
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:44.220]  Even jump out to Photoshop
[01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:45.100]  if you really need to,
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:46.300]  and then jump back.
[01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:47.620]  And I think that that was
[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:50.060]  an incredibly smart build for Adobe
[01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:52.780]  and really, really well done by them.
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:53.980]  I just think it hasn't been matched
[01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:54.860]  by any other tools.
[01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:57.420]  Including Aperture since it came out.
[01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:00.060]  And I know there's obviously devotees
[01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:01.740]  of either side, but, you know,
[01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:03.580]  people that loved Aperture out of luck anyway.
[01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:06.460]  So I think it's really, really a great tool.
[01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:08.780]  And I think it just may be the case
[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:12.340]  that the 80% use cases
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:15.460]  are never going to be that way.
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:17.180]  And Photos is always going to act
[01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:18.380]  and work that way.
[01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:20.300]  And we're just, we don't have the data
[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:22.300]  to understand that that's what people want.
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:23.500]  But I do agree with you
[01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:25.500]  that it's just not great for like
[01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:27.140]  going through a bunch of photos at once.
[01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:29.020]  I rarely, rarely ever use it
[01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:31.540]  for anything beyond opening it up,
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:33.260]  finding a photo and sharing it.
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:34.500]  Like that's the way I treat it.
[01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:36.740]  Like I'm able to search through photos
[01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:39.180]  by, you know, date or group or event
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:41.220]  and share them with family members
[01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:42.060]  and that sort of thing.
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:43.460]  If I'm going to do any sort of editing,
[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:44.420]  I open it in Lightroom.
[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:47.180]  So I haven't done the thought experiment
[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:49.180]  of trying to force myself to use it, you know,
[01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:51.020]  to see if I could,
[01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:52.420]  it would work with my workflow.
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:54.780]  So I haven't gone down the route you're going,
[01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:55.980]  but it doesn't,
[01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:58.060]  it doesn't appeal to me for those reasons.
[01:16:58.060 --> 01:16:59.660]  And I don't, I haven't used it.
[01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:01.700]  So I can't speak to, it's an efficacy there.
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:03.780]  I'm not, I don't want to speak out of turn.
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:05.980]  Here's a question I have for you.
[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:08.420]  Do you import your photos
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:10.660]  that you shoot on your iPhone into Lightroom?
[01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:13.580]  No.
[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:14.980]  Me neither.
[01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:15.820]  Me neither.
[01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:18.260]  With maybe like one or two rare exceptions,
[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:21.580]  you know, over the course of like six or seven years,
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:23.700]  once or twice, maybe there'd be something.
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:25.980]  Maybe I'm even wrong though.
[01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:26.820]  I don't, maybe I never did.
[01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:28.020]  I never, ever did that.
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:29.780]  So for years,
[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:34.460]  I had like two completely different photo universes.
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:36.620]  There was my Lightroom library,
[01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:39.220]  which was the images I shot with my, you know,
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:41.220]  Canon digital SLR.
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:43.060]  And, you know, within the last few years,
[01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:46.060]  my Fuji X100S.
[01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:48.340]  Oh, and, and years, earlier years,
[01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:53.020]  I had the Ricoh GRD.
[01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:55.980]  And in my mind, those were my real photos.
[01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:59.500]  And then I had my iPhone photo library,
[01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:02.540]  which was mostly just on my iPhone.
[01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:03.820]  And then every once in a while,
[01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:07.380]  I would like open up just image capture,
[01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:09.660]  copy all the ones off and put them, you know,
[01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:11.580]  put them in a folder in my Dropbox,
[01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:13.980]  just so I'd have a, you know, a backup phone.
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:14.820]  Right.
[01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:17.420]  I just have like a full, I literally just have,
[01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:19.060]  it's just goes by year I've got like,
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:21.140]  and I know Dropbox has some kind of feature like that,
[01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:22.580]  but I didn't, I don't like that feature
[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:24.460]  because I don't want Dropbox screwing around
[01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:26.260]  with my other photos.
[01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:28.620]  All I want is somewhere where everything I've taken
[01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:30.900]  with my iPhone is, you know,
[01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:32.660]  somewhere where it's accessible online.
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:34.620]  So I just have like a, you know, Dropbox.
[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:38.380]  I have like a iPhone photo library or something.
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:40.140]  I forget what I called it.
[01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:43.260]  And then inside that, it's just a one folder for each year.
[01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:45.580]  And inside that are all the photos I took on my iPhone
[01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:46.420]  from that year.
[01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:47.260]  That's it.
[01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:49.460]  And then, but, so I really liked,
[01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:51.820]  the thing I really do like about photos for Mac
[01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:55.300]  and the iCloud photo library is I love
[01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:57.620]  that I don't have to do that by hand.
[01:18:57.620 --> 01:18:59.460]  I don't have to like remember, hey, you know,
[01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:01.540]  it's been a couple months since I've backed up the,
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:04.380]  you know, the photos on my phone.
[01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:05.260]  They just show up.
[01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:07.340]  And I, you know, it's just one of those things
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:09.500]  where people say Apple doesn't get services right.
[01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:12.540]  Well, the, for me, at least the iCloud photo library,
[01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:15.380]  they got right because I take a screenshot on my phone
[01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:17.580]  or it's there within seconds.
[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:19.940]  It's there by the time I put my phone down
[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:23.340]  and go to my keyboard and switch to the photos app.
[01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:24.180]  And I go to that.
[01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:26.500]  Yeah, that's been really, really good.
[01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:29.700]  And that is really, really convenient for things like
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:32.380]  if I want to send somebody a screenshot
[01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:34.100]  of like an app that I'm testing.
[01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:39.100]  It's great if I'm at my desk and I have my Mac right here.
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:41.380]  And so I can, it'd be a lot easier for me to take,
[01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:43.780]  or maybe I'm already halfway through writing the email
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:45.900]  on my Mac.
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:48.540]  It's great to just switch to the, you know,
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:51.460]  take the screenshot on my phone, go to the photos app,
[01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:54.540]  and there it is, and I can get it right out.
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:55.380]  That's fantastic.
[01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:56.860]  So it kind of. Yeah, it's been really good.
[01:19:56.860 --> 01:20:00.540]  I mean, remember how bad, I mean, it was so bad before.
[01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:02.980]  Like, it would never show up in half the time.
[01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:04.580]  You have to reset it all the time and stuff.
[01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:05.780]  So they did, I mean, they did a good job
[01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:07.380]  with this iteration of it.
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:08.220]  Yeah.
[01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:12.620]  I don't know what to do in the long run, though.
[01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:13.460]  I don't know.
[01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:15.180]  That's what I, maybe what I should do,
[01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:17.620]  but it seems like an awful lot of busy work,
[01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:22.300]  is that every time I shoot photos that I put into Lightroom,
[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:24.620]  do my pics, adjust them the way I want,
[01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:27.220]  and export them all to, you know,
[01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:29.300]  the highest resolution JPEG possible,
[01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:31.380]  and then import those into the photos app,
[01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:32.220]  just so that those photos.
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:34.380]  Does photos support a watched folder?
[01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:36.820]  I don't think it does.
[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:38.700]  And if it did. That would be ideal.
[01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:41.820]  Yeah, but the problem, and again, maybe I'm not enough,
[01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:44.020]  maybe I need to, you know, take an advanced
[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:45.380]  Linda course on Lightroom,
[01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:47.100]  but I don't think that there's a way,
[01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:49.860]  but just because Lightroom's non-destructive,
[01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:51.980]  I don't think there's a way that there would be
[01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:54.740]  a watched photo, a watched thing,
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:56.900]  that would pick up my adjustments,
[01:20:56.900 --> 01:20:57.740]  unless I take the extra.
[01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:00.580]  No, no, you'd have to manually export them to JPEG,
[01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:02.420]  but in that fold, that watched folder,
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:03.380]  which would then be imported.
[01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:04.220]  You know what I mean?
[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:05.140]  Yeah, I see what you mean.
[01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:06.380]  So all I'd have to do is do the export.
[01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:08.740]  Like iTunes has that watched folder thing?
[01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:11.060]  Yeah, yeah, maybe, I don't know.
[01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:11.940]  Yeah, I don't think it does,
[01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:13.580]  but it would be a good feature if they added it,
[01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:14.580]  if anybody out there.
[01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:16.660]  For now, I'm bifurcated right down the middle.
[01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:21.180]  I mean, I'm still, like everything, my family stuff,
[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:22.660]  like the stuff that comes off of my,
[01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:25.700]  my wife and I, the way I set it up is that
[01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:27.820]  she has her own iCloud account for a lot of stuff
[01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:30.860]  that we share purchases, and I've rigged it up
[01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:34.500]  so that any photos we take are all imported.
[01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:36.860]  So we have, you know, shared iClouds for that,
[01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:38.500]  so I see her photos and my photos
[01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:40.700]  all in one iPhoto library.
[01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:42.060]  My wife doesn't even have a computer.
[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:43.980]  She uses her phone and an iPad.
[01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:46.300]  She doesn't, she's not interested.
[01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:48.580]  Her work doesn't use it, she doesn't need it,
[01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:51.100]  so it's not really a priority for her.
[01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:53.900]  She uses my laptop once every couple of months.
[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:55.420]  You know, like, oh, I wanna go, you know,
[01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:57.220]  browse a bunch of shopping sites or something.
[01:21:57.220 --> 01:21:59.700]  But in general, she does all of it from her iPad and phone.
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:01.700]  And so anything she takes or shoots or any of that
[01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:04.700]  is just dumped into my central repository on my iMac,
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:06.480]  and then, which is of course then backed up
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:09.740]  via Time Machine and then backed up to Backblaze,
[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:10.900]  you know, separately.
[01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:14.620]  But that central repository is our life
[01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:16.420]  from like the beginning.
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:18.620]  I think that honestly the first photos
[01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:20.780]  in my iPhoto library are right now,
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:22.700]  so I got married in 2004.
[01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:27.700]  And the photos in my library, wait, 2005?
[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:31.540]  Oh my God, my wife's gonna kill me.
[01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:35.720]  Anyhow, I got married before the iPhone, pre-iPhone.
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:39.040]  And so the first photos in my library
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:40.440]  from phones and all that jazz,
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:42.040]  you know, I had some older stuff imported in there,
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:43.480]  but mostly from the phones and stuff.
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:46.840]  Everything is our life, right, together,
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:48.120]  imported into that library.
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:49.440]  And once she got an iPhone,
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:52.540]  she started basically getting my hand-me-down iPhones
[01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:55.080]  and then eventually buying her own iPhones,
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:57.000]  new ones when she wanted them.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.600]  All of those photos are all in that repository.
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:04.100]  And so I view that as a timeline of my life.
[01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:06.040]  And I know this is the way that,
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.720]  this is the value that companies like Facebook
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:11.320]  and Dropbox see in the auto upload and Google,
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.040]  because it's a timeline of your entire life, right?
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:17.060]  Those photos are, there's so much data from them.
[01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:20.880]  And if Google can, for instance, tell you what's winter,
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:22.720]  then they know your kid's growing up.
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:25.080]  They can probably estimate its age, right?
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:28.420]  Like these are, there's a lot of data in those photos,
[01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:30.960]  and not to mention the actual metadata,
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:32.600]  which is very easy to read.
[01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:36.720]  So that aspect of things, that timeline,
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:41.320]  I like having that one repository for it there
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.280]  in photos now.
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:45.240]  And I don't like mixing in,
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:47.560]  because when I used to shoot like a wedding
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:49.720]  or something like that, I don't want that in there, right?
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:52.440]  I don't want that in my family library.
[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:53.880]  So that goes in iPhoto.
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:56.280]  And then if I ever do like, you know, a formal shoot,
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.640]  or if I pick up my SLR,
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:23:59.640]  which is getting more and more rare to be honest,
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:02.240]  and shoot family photos, then I will export those
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:03.480]  and I'll import those into iPhoto
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:07.440]  so that it remains a canonical record, you know,
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:09.960]  of our lives together in that thing.
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:12.960]  Whereas Lightroom is more along the lines of like,
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:17.160]  oh, I have a rare free day and I'm gonna go shoot landscapes
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:20.120]  or, you know, shoot macro stuff or whatever.
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.900]  I'm gonna use Lightroom for that purely.
[01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:26.240]  I'm never gonna touch photos.app with that stuff.
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:27.480]  Same here.
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:29.840]  All right, enough on photos.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:32.400]  Let's talk about our next sponsor.
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:36.640]  My next sponsor here is our good friends at Automattic.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:38.840]  Now this is a really, really cool thing.
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:42.240]  Automattic is a connected car adapter,
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:44.760]  plugs into your car's diagnostic port.
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:47.480]  Any car made in recent years has one of these things.
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:50.700]  It's the, this is what like your dashboard might light up
[01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:53.400]  and say, hey, you need service E3 or something like that.
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:55.240]  You don't even know what that means.
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:58.200]  Well, when you take it into the place, you know,
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:24:59.960]  your mechanic, the car dealer,
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.800]  wherever you go to get your car service,
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:04.440]  what they do is they know what that stuff means.
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:06.040]  But they plug a thing into this port
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:08.180]  and it tells them exactly what's going on.
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:12.680]  Every car since 1996 has one of these things.
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:15.640]  So the Automattic, it's a dongle, a dingus.
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:18.540]  You plug it in there and then they've got an app
[01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:20.560]  and the app pairs with your phone on Bluetooth
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:23.400]  and you get all of this information.
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:25.760]  And it's not just diagnostic information about like,
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:29.400]  you know, like the equivalent of the check engine coming on.
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:32.840]  It can tell you all sorts of stuff in plain English,
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:35.480]  like just like how efficiently you're driving.
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:37.540]  So it knows like mileage wise.
[01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:39.200]  So if you follow the advice of the app,
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:42.200]  you can get better mileage, you know,
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:44.960]  all sorts of advice on, as you drive,
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:47.260]  save money on gas, stuff like that.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:49.100]  It knows where you are.
[01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.080]  It integrates with your phone's GPS.
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:53.540]  So if you're, you know,
[01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:55.200]  if you don't have like a parking spot or something,
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:57.080]  if you, you know, park in a city or something like that,
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:58.360]  you'll never lose your car
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:01.100]  because the Automattic dingus knows where it is.
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:03.860]  Even has cool features.
[01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:05.820]  And again, I hope nobody ever has to use this.
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:07.160]  Nobody listening ever does.
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:10.480]  But it'll call emergency services in the case of an accident
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:12.000]  because the cars, you know,
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.480]  with the airbags and stuff like that,
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:17.020]  cars know when they're in an accident
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:19.440]  and the diagnostic port has the information.
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:21.260]  Automattic, if you were ever in an accident
[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:22.880]  and you couldn't call,
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:25.320]  Automattic will make a call like that to 911
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:28.600]  with your location data right away.
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.000]  Really, really cool features.
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:32.080]  Here's the thing.
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:33.240]  They've got a new thing in the App Store.
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:34.060]  I don't know if you've seen this,
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:36.400]  but this is brand new, really, really recent,
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:38.920]  is that they've got 20 apps.
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:42.460]  They call them apps for the Automattic platform.
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.960]  And it gives you all sorts of cool new stuff.
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:48.540]  You can integrate with Nest so that you're,
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:51.400]  you get close to home
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:55.080]  and have your thermostat adjust at the right time,
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:56.360]  just based on your location.
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.840]  All Automattic, based on the location of your car.
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:00.280]  You know, 15 miles from home,
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:02.280]  turn the thermostat to a new temperature.
[01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:05.520]  They integrate with IFTTT,
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:06.800]  if this, then that,
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:09.680]  gives you the power to build all kinds of recipes
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:12.940]  based on your driving.
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:15.580]  Minute levels of details.
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:17.260]  Really, really cool for tinkers.
[01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:22.060]  Just go to automattic.com slash apps,
[01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:23.220]  and you'll see more.
[01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:24.620]  I could go on and on and on.
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:27.620]  Here's the deal.
[01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:28.860]  You have, here's the code.
[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:30.300]  The code is the talk show.
[01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:32.900]  So go to automattic.com slash the talk show.
[01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:34.300]  You get the code.
[01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:36.660]  The code will save you 20%,
[01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:39.700]  and that's for anybody who listens to the show.
[01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:41.400]  It ships in two business days,
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:43.980]  and they have a 45-day return policy.
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:45.060]  Here's the thing.
[01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:47.260]  It's 100 bucks, period.
[01:27:47.260 --> 01:27:48.080]  You just buy it.
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.420]  It's just a thing that you buy.
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:51.100]  It's not a service you subscribe to.
[01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:52.380]  You don't pay 10 bucks a month
[01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:54.040]  so that you can keep using it.
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:57.220]  You buy one of these things once, 100 bucks,
[01:27:57.220 --> 01:27:58.840]  but with the code, the talk show,
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:01.540]  it's only 80 bucks, 80 bucks.
[01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:02.380]  That's it.
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:03.220]  You own it.
[01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:04.040]  You're in.
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:06.060]  You're good for as long as the thing lasts,
[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:08.260]  and that's it, 80 bucks,
[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:09.720]  and you get all of this cool stuff.
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:10.780]  The app is free.
[01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:12.020]  All of these things are free.
[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:13.360]  It's really, really fun.
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:14.760]  So anybody who has a car,
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:16.480]  why not buy this thing for 80 bucks?
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:18.100]  You're crazy if you don't.
[01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:19.700]  So go to automatic.com.
[01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:21.500]  Automatic is spelled the normal way.
[01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:24.140]  Automatic.com slash the talk show and find out more.
[01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:25.180]  My thanks to them.
[01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:26.000]  Go buy this thing.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.180]  It's really, really cool,
[01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:31.420]  and set up some cool if this, then that recipes.
[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:33.120]  How do you pronounce I-F-T-T-T?
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:35.020]  I don't know if you say if this, then that,
[01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:37.420]  or do you say I-F-T-T-T?
[01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:38.740]  I say ift.
[01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:39.780]  I may be wrong.
[01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:41.820]  Yeah, I just say ift.
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:44.780]  It's one of those things where I see it,
[01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:47.260]  I read it with my eyes all the time,
[01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:49.520]  and I don't really hear it.
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:51.180]  I don't know how you're supposed to say it.
[01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:53.500]  When I interview them, I think they say ift.
[01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:55.300]  I've talked to those guys plenty,
[01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:57.140]  and I think they say ift.
[01:28:57.140 --> 01:29:00.500]  I may be wrong, but I like that stuff.
[01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:02.620]  I like that thing a lot, that product.
[01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:04.860]  I really hope they find a path to success there
[01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:06.940]  in terms of how to survive, how to make money,
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:08.420]  because I think it's awesome.
[01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:13.420]  Yeah, they're like the glue between everything.
[01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:15.180]  What's the internet of things?
[01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:16.700]  God, that's an annoying term.
[01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:21.700]  But ift, ift, ift, ift, it's more and more,
[01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:25.980]  it's like everything that could integrate with that
[01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:28.820]  integrates with it, which is really kind of awesome.
[01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:31.260]  And it's sort of an old, to me,
[01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:33.900]  it's the thing that they have that I really like
[01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:38.900]  is it's the old school, early internet idea
[01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:41.880]  of we're gonna open this stuff up and have APIs,
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:45.620]  and we're just truly open.
[01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:47.100]  Anything that can't integrate with us,
[01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:49.200]  you don't have to work out a business development deal
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:50.740]  or something like that.
[01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:53.960]  We're not gonna cut you off, like with the Twitter API
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:56.660]  where there's these keys, and you can get cut off
[01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:58.080]  based on the whims of the stuff.
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:29:58.980]  It's all just open.
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:01.260]  It's just there, and any way you can figure out a way
[01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:03.780]  to integrate your product with them, you can do it,
[01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:05.740]  which to me is really cool,
[01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:07.980]  and we don't see enough of that anymore.
[01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:11.700]  No, I mean, they're the spiritual successor to Yahoo Pipes,
[01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:14.100]  which was just shut down this year.
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:15.380]  I loved Yahoo Pipes.
[01:30:15.380 --> 01:30:16.580]  That was so fun.
[01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:17.660]  Yeah, it's a shame that they,
[01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:19.240]  because that was a very Yahoo feature, too.
[01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:21.020]  It's a shame that they, I'm not surprised
[01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:22.420]  that they got rid of it, but it's.
[01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:23.940]  Yeah, I'm not too shocked.
[01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:24.980]  I'm not like, oh, why?
[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:27.100]  You know, but it's still kind of a bummer
[01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:29.080]  that it doesn't exist anymore, you know?
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:31.240]  Yeah, what else?
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:32.140]  What else is in the news?
[01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:34.480]  I saw there was a thing last week
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:37.300]  where the San Jose Business Journal reported
[01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:42.300]  that Apple bought an enormous piece of land.
[01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:46.180]  I guess it's about as big as the campus
[01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:48.780]  that they're building somewhere
[01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:51.840]  in that undeveloped land outside San Jose.
[01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:53.980]  I'm sure you saw.
[01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:56.060]  Yeah, they bought a big chunk of property, yeah.
[01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:57.940]  And nobody really has any idea
[01:30:57.940 --> 01:31:00.380]  what the hell they're gonna do with it, right?
[01:31:00.380 --> 01:31:02.860]  I mean, but that's the thing.
[01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:05.820]  It's like, it is news, and it is interesting
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:08.620]  that they bought an enormous piece of land,
[01:31:08.620 --> 01:31:12.340]  but then they're not saying what they're gonna do with it,
[01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:14.860]  and so everybody is just left to speculate,
[01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:16.480]  which is great because this is what we do.
[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:18.060]  We're professional speculators.
[01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:20.260]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[01:31:20.260 --> 01:31:22.660]  It is almost better when you can just speculate
[01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:25.220]  when you know that literally only four people
[01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:27.540]  even know what they're gonna build on it.
[01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:32.060]  Tim Cook knows, Eddie knows, and a couple other people know,
[01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:34.220]  but that's it, you know?
[01:31:34.220 --> 01:31:35.340]  Because then you're free to just say,
[01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:37.220]  hey, I wonder what they could do.
[01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:39.040]  You're not actually tied down to going,
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.380]  well, let's report this out,
[01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:43.000]  because somebody knows, there's a chain.
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:47.580]  Yeah, I mean, like 15,000 workers or whatever there
[01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:50.460]  is what Mercury News was estimating, I think,
[01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:51.740]  that they could hold.
[01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:56.820]  And they already bought a 290,000 square foot building
[01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:58.780]  in North San Jose as well,
[01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:00.500]  and I guess this is like their first office there
[01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:03.760]  since the 80s, so they're definitely investing,
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:08.760]  and it is interesting to me that they're buying a plot
[01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:13.820]  of land that is car factory sized.
[01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:14.660]  Yeah.
[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:15.820]  I mean, it's just interesting.
[01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:19.060]  Interesting is like the only word I couldn't use
[01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:21.140]  for it at the moment.
[01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:24.540]  I do wonder, though, I mean, and it's like,
[01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:29.540]  if they don't build any of the computer,
[01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:32.380]  I know, and I guess they do build like the Mac Pros,
[01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:35.100]  but that whole building the Mac Pros and the US thing,
[01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:37.300]  you haven't heard much about that recently.
[01:32:38.140 --> 01:32:39.060]  And the phones, of course,
[01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:42.060]  are still all assembled in China.
[01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:43.540]  I'm not saying that means that they would,
[01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:46.900]  and I realize that shipping a phone from China to the US
[01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:50.420]  is very different than shipping a car from China to the US,
[01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:52.140]  and I'm not saying that means that they would make cars
[01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:53.860]  in China, but I don't know.
[01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:58.660]  The factory, it is interesting that it would fit a factory,
[01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:00.540]  and there are cars made in the US.
[01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:02.980]  I mean, that's the difference.
[01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:06.400]  There's a lot of cars made in the US, so it's possible.
[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:10.620]  It sure is interesting.
[01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:11.820]  What's the square foot?
[01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:16.820]  So it's 43 acres, and I wonder what square foot
[01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:18.620]  is that rural is it?
[01:33:18.620 --> 01:33:24.580]  The Tesla factory is 5.3 million square feet.
[01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:27.940]  I don't know what this 43-acre piece of land translates into,
[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:32.100]  but it seems to be a comparative size,
[01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:33.700]  but I'm getting into trouble here
[01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:34.540]  because I haven't done the math.
[01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:37.940]  But regardless, Tesla has a factory in Fremont.
[01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:39.100]  You know the story behind that,
[01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:40.500]  how they got that factory, right?
[01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:41.700]  No, I don't think so.
[01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:46.180]  So there was a factory there
[01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:49.820]  that was owned by GM and Toyota,
[01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:54.820]  and it was like 1984, Toyota and GM got together.
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:00.340]  This was like right post the whole Japanese cars, what?
[01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:01.900]  And then everybody was realizing Toyota
[01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:04.960]  was actually way ahead of American manufacturing,
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:06.740]  and they got together,
[01:34:06.740 --> 01:34:08.520]  and they created this thing called Numi,
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:11.240]  which is, I don't know what it stands for.
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:12.880]  I just remember the acronym because it's funny,
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:16.420]  but it's like a united motor or something.
[01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:17.500]  But basically they got together
[01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:18.860]  and created this Numi partnership
[01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:22.780]  where they worked on advanced tech in there together
[01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:24.280]  that they would share,
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:25.800]  whether that's stuff that goes in the dash
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:27.540]  or drive train or whatever, I don't know.
[01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:29.380]  But anyhow, it was this partnership
[01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:32.020]  that existed for years until like 2009.
[01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:34.420]  And right when the partnership was dissolving
[01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:36.420]  and they were looking to sell the factory,
[01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:38.280]  Tesla was like running out of money
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:41.460]  and didn't have enough to buy to build their own,
[01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:42.680]  but just had enough money
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:46.520]  and was able to raise enough money to buy this factory.
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:50.260]  And I think GM actually took a stake,
[01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:52.660]  if I remember correctly, in Tesla or Toyota did,
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:53.500]  I can't remember which.
[01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:55.320]  But basically they were able to buy this factory
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:57.520]  for pennies, pennies on the dollar,
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:00.120]  because this would normally require billions to buy.
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:03.880]  But Apple certainly doesn't have that problem.
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:05.560]  They have billions, they could definitely buy it,
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:06.640]  buy their own factory.
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:07.640]  But I just thought it was very interesting,
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:09.320]  like Tesla was able to scoop this thing up
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:10.900]  and renovate it and make it their own,
[01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:12.160]  and now they've done several upgrades,
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:14.120]  it's all pristine, white,
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:16.680]  and all kinds of robotic stuff inside.
[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:17.660]  It's very, very impressive,
[01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:22.660]  but one wonders what one could do with unlimited funds,
[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:25.500]  and not having to just scoop up something
[01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:27.060]  that already existed on the fly.
[01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:28.800]  Because Tesla's done a pretty decent job
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:30.780]  of turning out cars from that
[01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:32.620]  when nobody thought they ever could.
[01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:34.340]  So it'd be interesting to see what somebody could build
[01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:37.140]  from the ground up that had essentially unlimited money.
[01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:41.180]  Big picture, and it's one of those
[01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:42.480]  where there's smoke, there's fire things.
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:43.960]  I mean, Apple's made hires,
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:46.360]  they've hired people from the auto industry.
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:49.880]  In some sense, it seems crazy.
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:52.080]  It's like, come on, does everybody gonna make cars?
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:57.080]  But on the other hand, to me, it kind of makes sense.
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:01.000]  And to me, the idea of Apple getting into making cars,
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.600]  and there was this big leak
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:05.440]  that they've had high-level discussions with BMW
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:10.320]  about a partnership maybe, clearly, they're looking into it.
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:12.740]  I mean, you can almost state that as a fact.
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:15.920]  And the only way that it's not a fact
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:17.960]  that they're at least thinking about making cars
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:20.800]  would mean that an awful lot of reporting
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:21.880]  has been fabricated.
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:24.560]  So they're at least looking into it.
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:26.880]  I think that it's-
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:27.700]  I think it's definitely safe to say
[01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:29.880]  they're looking at cars, the automotive space.
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:31.140]  I mean, they're not gonna get into car play
[01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:34.360]  and not think about the rest of the dash at the very least.
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:36.820]  I think, at a very high level,
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:38.120]  it just makes intuitive sense
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:40.680]  because cars cost a lot of money,
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:45.540]  and they involve, and can be differentiated and succeed
[01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:46.940]  because of design.
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:54.240]  And they're going to be increasingly computerized
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:56.720]  in various ways, not just like what,
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:58.000]  having a touchscreen on the dash,
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.940]  but the self-driving and stuff like that,
[01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:03.880]  and crash detection, and trying to make cars
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:05.960]  that, whether they're self-driving,
[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:08.400]  or entirely, or partially, or something like that,
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:11.980]  but we're gonna head, within our lifetimes,
[01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:14.520]  we're gonna get to a point where cars can't crash.
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:21.160]  Or at least it's exceedingly rare.
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:23.520]  Yeah, it's very, very difficult to do.
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:26.820]  Try to get it up to airline levels of safety,
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:30.860]  as opposed to, it's truly, I mean,
[01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:33.320]  if you really, I think, and then we'll quickly look back
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:36.960]  on the number of people who die every year now
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:40.080]  in car accidents, and it's gonna look barbaric.
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:41.680]  I really do think that's coming.
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:44.240]  So there's A, there's money to be made,
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:48.400]  B, design counts, C, they can be cool.
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:51.320]  Therefore, why wouldn't Apple wanna make it?
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:53.640]  Really, I mean, aren't those the exact arguments
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:55.840]  behind why they got into making watches?
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:58.600]  People spend a lot of money on them, design counts,
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:00.160]  and we think watches are cool.
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:03.640]  Therefore, we're gonna make a watch.
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:05.760]  Yeah, yeah, I think so.
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:08.760]  I think you're right in that the thought process is,
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:10.400]  can we differentiate, right?
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:11.600]  It's not, can we make money?
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:13.880]  And I think that a lot of people run aground against that
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:16.040]  when they're thinking about what Apple will or won't do,
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:18.200]  or may or may not do, and then they run aground
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:19.680]  against this argument like, oh, well,
[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:21.080]  can they make a bunch of money at it?
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:23.360]  And that's not necessarily the argument.
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:24.800]  I mean, I think it's obviously part of it,
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:28.460]  and I don't ever foresee Apple going into a business
[01:38:28.460 --> 01:38:32.100]  where they can't sustain it on its own merit,
[01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:34.900]  or as a support structure for another business,
[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:36.760]  which is the way kind of iTunes worked for many years
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:38.240]  until it started making a lot of money.
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:42.000]  But I think that it's highly unlikely
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.720]  that they're ever going to go into a space
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:46.440]  where they can't differentiate themselves strongly,
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:48.240]  and that differentiation doesn't lead
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:50.880]  to what they perceive anyway.
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:52.680]  Let's just sidestep any arguments,
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:55.180]  but what they perceive to be consumer benefit,
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:57.160]  you know, benefit for people that are buying it.
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:59.940]  And I think cars are ripe for that,
[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:02.460]  because, I mean, I love, I love, love cars.
[01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:04.920]  I mean, I grew up building cars with my dad.
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:07.800]  I love them in all forms, from old to new,
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:10.640]  and this side to that side of the world.
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:15.280]  But most of them, most of them are crap.
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:17.800]  Like, they're super, they're crap.
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:21.200]  Like, I sit in, I crawl into a,
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:22.600]  I don't even want to mention brand names,
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:23.520]  because some people get offended,
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:26.560]  but you crawl into a mid-sized sedan,
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:29.440]  and you just look at, like, the finish makes my skin itch.
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:32.360]  Like, the door panels, you touch them,
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:34.520]  and the plastic you feel,
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:37.400]  like the fingertip feel on the steering wheel,
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:40.320]  it just makes me break out in a rash most of the time.
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:41.840]  And so I just think that there's so many,
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:43.920]  I mean, can you imagine, Joni,
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:46.560]  I have waxing rhapsodic about the leather wrapping
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:48.040]  on a steering wheel, I could.
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:50.080]  You know, I just think that there's plenty of opportunity
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:53.600]  there for them to offer a cut above
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:57.240]  at a price that is reasonable for what you're getting,
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:01.680]  like safety innovations, design innovations,
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:03.600]  technology and electronics innovations
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:05.360]  that set them apart from the pack,
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:07.880]  offer user benefit, and allow them to differentiate.
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:10.680]  It's like a no-brainer that they could do something there.
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:12.160]  Right, and the industry is heading
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:14.160]  towards some sort of inflection point
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:17.280]  where new technologies are finally,
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:18.920]  I hate to abuse the word finally,
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:22.720]  but finally taking over from internal combustion engine
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:27.720]  and I haven't, I've actually never been in a Tesla Model S.
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:30.280]  I do love, I love the way they look,
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:31.440]  but I've never been in one.
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:33.320]  But somebody mentioned the other day
[01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:35.200]  that it doesn't have the,
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:37.520]  because it doesn't have a transmission,
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:40.200]  it doesn't have the transmission hump on the floor.
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:43.000]  Right, yeah, there's no center column hump.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.920]  Right, and it never occurred to me
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:50.040]  that a car couldn't, wouldn't have that.
[01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:52.440]  Every car I've ever been in has had the transmission hump.
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:53.280]  It's, I've never even thought about.
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:55.160]  That you treat it as lost space, you know,
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:56.720]  that you never get it back. Right, it's a,
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:57.560]  what do you mean that there's nothing?
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:40:59.320]  I was like, oh, of course not.
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:00.480]  You know, but that's crazy to me.
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:02.680]  But you know, and it's just one small thing of like,
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:04.840]  hey, look, we can rethink lots of things,
[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:07.280]  you know, with new technology and we're headed there.
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:08.640]  So it's kind of exciting.
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:11.880]  The thing is, is that making cars is,
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:14.240]  physically, it takes a lot of space.
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:16.800]  So I really do hate to, I mean, it's just a guess.
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:19.120]  I don't know anything about this real estate transaction.
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:20.160]  Yeah, me neither.
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:22.440]  I, it, if I had to bet though, boy,
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:24.760]  I have to think it's about the car development thing.
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:27.360]  Just because I think you need so much space, you know,
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:30.280]  that, and maybe you'd want to have them off on their own,
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:32.280]  you know, campus.
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:35.760]  Yeah, I mean, the problem with all this,
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:37.720]  the divining rod stuff about the car
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:39.960]  and about any other project is that they probably have
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:43.160]  half a dozen really far out project,
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:47.240]  projects that would blow up in headlines going on right now.
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:48.840]  They literally are just like, I don't know,
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:50.280]  let's try this, right?
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:52.040]  And they put several people on it
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:54.040]  and they give them some resources and they play with it
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:56.200]  until they see if something interesting comes of it.
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:59.160]  And I think that's just the value of having their structure,
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:02.480]  their cellular structure, the way that they,
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:04.680]  they develop products and experiment and play
[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:06.560]  with different lines of thought.
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:09.600]  So the watch interface came out of that and, you know,
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:12.320]  the obviously multi-touch, everybody knows by now
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:14.120]  that multi-touch came out of that, you know,
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:16.680]  out of essentially a side bet experiment.
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:19.840]  And that kind of thing leads to,
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:22.840]  I mean, it leads to misinformation
[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:25.480]  because somebody can take something as being,
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:30.000]  you know, in production or them getting ready to launch
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.840]  and it's really just four guys in a room
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:33.760]  kind of talking about it, you know?
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:36.800]  And I think that that aspect of it leads to a lot
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:39.680]  of false starts and false leads and all that jazz.
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:41.680]  So it's hard to throw a divining rod on this,
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:45.480]  but considering the stuff that we've heard publicly
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:47.440]  and seen publicly, the amount of people
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:49.640]  that they've hired there, I think it's safe to say
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:52.440]  that they see something worth exploring
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:53.960]  in the automotive space.
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:56.040]  And I think that if you're looking there,
[01:42:56.040 --> 01:42:58.680]  then you start thinking about technologies
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:03.080]  that would attach to that space and some of the stuff
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:04.800]  that we've seen over the past couple of years,
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:06.920]  like patents and things that I've heard
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:08.680]  and things that people have reported,
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:10.840]  but were never able to really lock down,
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:13.720]  it starts to make some sense because when you start thinking
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:16.320]  about rethinking the car, as you mentioned
[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:18.960]  with like the hump on the floor, right?
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:21.520]  That's something you don't foresee until you get in there
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:24.280]  and then you're like, oh, hey, we don't need this, right?
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:26.000]  Like this doesn't exist in our car.
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.120]  Like Tesla's first one was a revamped, you know,
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:31.200]  smart car from like GM and then they did
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:34.820]  a revamped Mercedes, like a Mercedes like C-glass
[01:43:34.820 --> 01:43:36.840]  or something like that that they just made electric.
[01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:39.720]  Obviously in those, those design things aren't apparent
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:41.860]  because they haven't built it from the ground up
[01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:43.200]  to work it the way that they want.
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:44.680]  And then when they start designing the Model S,
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:47.720]  they're like, oh, hey, we don't need this, right?
[01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:49.120]  And I think that there's some other things
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:51.040]  you could think about, like for instance,
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:52.740]  augmented reality, right?
[01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:55.120]  You've seen Apple patents about 3D gesture control
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:58.060]  and augmented reality for a while and rumblings of that.
[01:43:58.060 --> 01:43:59.680]  What if they have an augmented reality team
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:00.800]  and somebody goes, oh, well,
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:02.840]  they're gonna launch augmented reality for,
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:04.800]  in like a glasses for your face.
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:06.400]  Well, maybe not.
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:08.120]  What if it's for a windshield?
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:09.600]  What if you don't have to think about the way
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:11.320]  a windshield works in the same way?
[01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:13.600]  And obviously other car manufacturers have sort of played
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:16.240]  with this idea of the windshield providing you
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:17.480]  with a heads up display.
[01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:20.080]  But what if they took that to like its logical extent
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:22.980]  and said, it's not only gonna give you, you know,
[01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:25.080]  like, oh, here's the speed limit.
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:27.360]  It's gonna give you like collision warnings
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:29.300]  and it's gonna highlight potholes for you
[01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:30.280]  and all this other stuff.
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:32.680]  There's just so much stuff that could be done
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:35.780]  but hasn't been done because people are so tied
[01:44:35.780 --> 01:44:37.680]  into the way things work now.
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:40.280]  And they're convinced that they can get away
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:42.540]  with offering people the lowest common denominator
[01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:45.280]  of product and still charge them the same amount for it.
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:46.380]  So they don't have to.
[01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:48.760]  They've not been forced to innovate by anybody.
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:50.520]  And Tesla's starting to do that.
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:52.880]  There's certain people starting to feel the heat from them.
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:54.760]  But can you imagine how the industry would be changed
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:57.240]  if Apple kind of threw their hat in the ring and said,
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:44:58.460]  we're thinking hard about this
[01:44:58.460 --> 01:45:00.120]  and this is the way things work now.
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:02.200]  I mean, look at the damn phones, you know?
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:04.680]  Like everybody was happy with the way phones were working.
[01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:06.120]  And then Apple's like, no, this is the way it should work.
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:08.040]  And everybody's like, oh, okay, yeah,
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:10.000]  that's the way things work now, you know?
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.080]  So I think there's cool potential there
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:15.260]  for everyone to end up benefiting,
[01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:17.200]  regardless of whether they own an Apple car or not.
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:19.320]  And I think those are the coolest things.
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:23.800]  I think the thing that gets overlooked about,
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:28.560]  from the tech industry is like inside the valley,
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:32.080]  the perspective that I think is missed
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:35.740]  is the degree to which Apple can,
[01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:40.460]  with the stature that they have now,
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:43.680]  the way that they can influence the culture as a whole.
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:45.620]  And just as where I'm going with this
[01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:47.920]  is the way that they've just got people
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:52.920]  talking about watches, period, outside the tech world.
[01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:56.060]  And in the tech world, the argument would be,
[01:45:56.060 --> 01:46:00.180]  well, Apple Watch is just the newest smartwatch.
[01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:02.820]  We've had Pebble and there's Android Wear
[01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:06.740]  and Samsung has made a whole bunch of watches
[01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:08.900]  in the last two or three years.
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:12.340]  And none of those ever, ever exited
[01:46:12.340 --> 01:46:15.300]  that you have to be a nerd to even know about them.
[01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:18.220]  Nobody, and regardless of how many people
[01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:22.060]  have already bought an Apple Watch,
[01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:25.740]  it's out there and people, like when I wear my Apple Watch,
[01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:27.780]  people say, is that an Apple Watch?
[01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:30.740]  Like, and they just are aware that it exists.
[01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:33.220]  Like, to me, that sort of awareness could really,
[01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:36.340]  you know, Apple can influence the car industry
[01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:38.740]  in the same way, you know, that the people
[01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:43.040]  will be aware of it in a way that they're not aware of,
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:44.740]  you know, like Google self-driving cars
[01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:45.740]  and stuff like that.
[01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:49.060]  Yeah, I think so too.
[01:46:49.060 --> 01:46:50.580]  I think that there's an opportunity there
[01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:54.220]  for them to sort of lay down a bar
[01:46:54.220 --> 01:46:56.440]  that people have to cross, right,
[01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:59.860]  and have to rise above in order to be relevant.
[01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:01.900]  And that's the sort of thing with the phones.
[01:47:01.900 --> 01:47:03.940]  I just thought, wouldn't it be funny
[01:47:03.940 --> 01:47:05.300]  if they came out with a car,
[01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:07.340]  then you had to have an iPhone?
[01:47:07.340 --> 01:47:12.340]  Yeah, like, oh yeah, it works without your iPhone,
[01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:15.020]  but only for 20 miles.
[01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:19.940]  It doesn't, no GPS, nothing.
[01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:21.940]  I don't know, maybe it doesn't even start up
[01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:23.540]  without your iPhone, I don't know.
[01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:25.220]  Or maybe it does, you know, like the only way
[01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:30.220]  you can start it is through, you know, Touch ID
[01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:31.780]  with your watch or phone.
[01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:35.700]  Let me take one last break here
[01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:40.540]  and thank our last sponsor of the day,
[01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:42.540]  or of the episode at least.
[01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:45.380]  And it is our good friends at MailRoute,
[01:47:45.380 --> 01:47:50.140]  M-A-I-L-R-O-U-T-E, MailRoute.
[01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:52.580]  You know who should be handling your email?
[01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:57.020]  Email nerds who do nothing but email.
[01:47:57.020 --> 01:47:58.940]  These guys created the first cloud-based
[01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:00.380]  email filtering solution,
[01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:01.940]  and then they sold it to Microsoft.
[01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:04.660]  Now they're back with the most innovative
[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:08.660]  and effective spam and virus filtering available.
[01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:10.920]  Virus filtering, I mean, I guess that's a big Windows thing.
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:12.300]  I mean, for me as a Mac user,
[01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:15.140]  I don't really worry about getting viruses in my email.
[01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:16.380]  I do worry about spam.
[01:48:16.380 --> 01:48:21.300]  And what MailRoute does is it gives you a world
[01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:25.780]  without spam, viruses, or bounced emails.
[01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:28.980]  Imagine opening up your email hosted on your domain
[01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:31.320]  and seeing only the legitimate email
[01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:33.380]  that you want to see and receive.
[01:48:33.380 --> 01:48:36.700]  MailRoute can make this a daily reality.
[01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:40.460]  No matter, if you have your own domain,
[01:48:40.460 --> 01:48:41.500]  that's the thing you need.
[01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:44.860]  Regardless of who hosts it, MailRoute can help.
[01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:47.920]  What you do is you just set up your DNS
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:50.640]  so that your mail goes to MailRoute first
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:54.740]  and then MailRoute, you give them the DNS
[01:48:54.740 --> 01:48:56.100]  for your actual email server.
[01:48:56.100 --> 01:48:58.580]  So outside world, the email comes through MailRoute,
[01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:00.480]  MailRoute takes out all the crap
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:05.140]  and forwards on what's good to your email server.
[01:49:05.140 --> 01:49:06.940]  So your email server, the server that's actually
[01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:08.500]  hosting your email, doesn't change at all.
[01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:10.940]  You just change the DNS, and they have all sorts of stuff
[01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:12.540]  to help you through doing that.
[01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:15.980]  You just have the email go through them first,
[01:49:15.980 --> 01:49:17.020]  then it goes to your server.
[01:49:17.020 --> 01:49:18.700]  You don't even have to change your server.
[01:49:18.700 --> 01:49:21.300]  And all of a sudden, all the junk is gone.
[01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:23.100]  And it is super high quality.
[01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:26.860]  I know tons and tons of people out there who use Gmail
[01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:29.860]  only because of their spam filtering.
[01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:33.000]  I think MailRoute is as good or better than Gmail.
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.840]  I do have some Gmail, the email that goes through Gmail.
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:38.180]  Also I have email that goes through MailRoute.
[01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:41.700]  Honestly, if anything, I think MailRoute is better.
[01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:45.500]  I think less spam goes through MailRoute than Gmail.
[01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:47.540]  It's certainly competitive, really, really is.
[01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:50.140]  And therefore, if you want, for all the good reasons
[01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:52.380]  that you might want to host your own email
[01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:56.260]  on your own domain, it is a tremendous, tremendous service.
[01:49:56.260 --> 01:50:01.260]  I cannot say how well this works for filtering out the junk.
[01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:05.780]  And it's got cool features where, here's the big thing.
[01:50:05.780 --> 01:50:07.540]  Yes, you wanna filter out all the junk,
[01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:09.500]  but in case something is falsely flagged,
[01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:10.340]  how do you find out?
[01:50:10.340 --> 01:50:13.580]  Well, you can set it up if you want to send you a report,
[01:50:13.580 --> 01:50:16.820]  like a weekly report, like here's a bunch of the maybes,
[01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:19.820]  here's a bunch of emails that we thought were spam,
[01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:21.000]  we held them for you.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.380]  If you want to go and correct one of these,
[01:50:23.380 --> 01:50:25.780]  just here's where you go and click, click this,
[01:50:25.780 --> 01:50:28.680]  okay, we'll remember that this is not spam.
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:31.140]  Really, really easy, easy to set up.
[01:50:31.140 --> 01:50:32.580]  It's very reliable.
[01:50:32.580 --> 01:50:35.400]  It's used by large universities, large corporations.
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:37.260]  They've got huge clients.
[01:50:37.260 --> 01:50:38.820]  I just can't say enough about it.
[01:50:38.820 --> 01:50:41.180]  It's really, really good.
[01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:43.500]  It's got a good user interface, simple and effective.
[01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:46.340]  If you're just a user, it's great, it just works.
[01:50:46.340 --> 01:50:47.460]  You'll forget that it's there
[01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:48.860]  because you just don't see it.
[01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:50.580]  That's how good email should work.
[01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:51.700]  You just forget it.
[01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:55.680]  If you're an email admin or IT pro,
[01:50:55.680 --> 01:50:58.040]  they've built all sorts of tools with you in mind.
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:51:00.920]  They even have an API so you can program your own stuff
[01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:03.440]  to work against it.
[01:51:04.300 --> 01:51:08.140]  They support LDAP, Active Directory, TLS, mail bagging,
[01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:10.380]  outbound relay, everything you want
[01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:12.500]  from the people handling your email.
[01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:13.460]  And this is all they do.
[01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:16.020]  All they do is just host, or not host email,
[01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:20.500]  but deal with email and make it as trouble-free as possible.
[01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:22.980]  So to remove spam from your life for good,
[01:51:22.980 --> 01:51:26.860]  go to mailroute.net
[01:51:26.860 --> 01:51:29.640]  slash TTS,
[01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:32.820]  the talk show slash TTS,
[01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:35.060]  and they'll know you came from the show
[01:51:35.060 --> 01:51:36.940]  and you'll get a free trial.
[01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:40.460]  And because you use that code slash TTS,

[01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:51.120]  by using that code when you sign up.

[01:51:55.380 --> 01:51:57.020]  Cannot say enough good things about them.
[01:51:57.020 --> 01:51:58.620]  Great, great service.
[01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:01.560]  I would almost say indispensable
[01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:03.540]  if you're hosting your own email.
[01:52:03.540 --> 01:52:04.480]  Really great stuff.
[01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:07.980]  What else is in the news?
[01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:08.820]  I'm trying to think.
[01:52:08.820 --> 01:52:12.080]  There was the thing, you must know about this,
[01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:13.820]  and I guess it didn't come out.
[01:52:13.820 --> 01:52:15.300]  It just came out yesterday with Mark Gurman,
[01:52:15.300 --> 01:52:19.660]  where your former colleague, Darryl Etherington,
[01:52:19.660 --> 01:52:22.940]  is now working for Apple PR in Toronto.
[01:52:22.940 --> 01:52:23.780]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:25.820]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:29.740]  I obviously know he doesn't work for me anymore.
[01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:31.060]  I was about to say.
[01:52:32.060 --> 01:52:34.180]  I was about to say, I would hope,
[01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:36.780]  I would hope, Matthew, that you know half the story.
[01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:42.660]  Yes, Darryl is no longer in our employ.
[01:52:42.660 --> 01:52:43.740]  He doesn't work for me anymore,
[01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:46.160]  but I, out of respect for him,
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:48.420]  didn't pry into what exactly he's doing,
[01:52:48.420 --> 01:52:51.620]  although my assumption is yes, comms in Canada.
[01:52:53.460 --> 01:52:55.340]  Yeah, it's a gentleman's agreement
[01:52:55.340 --> 01:52:57.500]  when it's somebody who was your former colleague.
[01:52:57.500 --> 01:52:58.340]  But it's interesting.
[01:52:58.340 --> 01:53:00.840]  Yeah, and it doesn't make any sense for me to pry anymore
[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:03.760]  because it's a company we cover,
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:06.140]  and the less that I learn about it through friend channels,
[01:53:06.140 --> 01:53:07.380]  the more I can report on it
[01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:10.020]  through my normal reporting channels.
[01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:10.860]  It's one of those things.
[01:53:10.860 --> 01:53:12.500]  It's a careful line you have to tread,
[01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:15.360]  especially when somebody crosses the line
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:20.360]  in between a PR or comms and a journalistic entity.
[01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:24.020]  And there's some people that get irritated with that,
[01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:26.140]  especially there's some hardline journalists
[01:53:26.140 --> 01:53:27.980]  that are really irritated by it.
[01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:31.900]  I'm on my third career, and I'm very, very reluctant
[01:53:31.900 --> 01:53:35.140]  to denigrate anybody, to look down on anybody
[01:53:35.140 --> 01:53:37.620]  for trying to chase what makes them happy
[01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:39.760]  and find something that they wanna be happy doing.
[01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:41.820]  And hey, I wish them the best.
[01:53:41.820 --> 01:53:46.580]  Yeah, while you're doing the job on one of these sides,
[01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:48.940]  like if you're like us right now
[01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:51.380]  and you're in some kind of media
[01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:56.380]  where we're covering Apple for our readership,
[01:53:57.480 --> 01:54:01.700]  and somebody else is working for Apple on their PR staff,
[01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:04.800]  it's obviously it is two opposing sides
[01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:07.560]  where one side is, by definition,
[01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:09.580]  their job is to push the company's line,
[01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:12.780]  and our job is to make sure that we're writing
[01:54:12.780 --> 01:54:15.980]  what's true and useful for our readership.
[01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:19.140]  I don't think there's any reason to have hard feelings
[01:54:19.140 --> 01:54:22.200]  about somebody who goes from one side to the other.
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:26.700]  I mean, it's sort of a natural transition.
[01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:28.740]  The thing is, though, here's the thing, though.
[01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:32.900]  The thing is that where it's disproportionate,
[01:54:32.900 --> 01:54:37.900]  where it's not balanced, is Apple has a lot of money,
[01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:39.660]  and the media-
[01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:42.020]  Yes, I'm aware, I know.
[01:54:42.020 --> 01:54:44.140]  It's very hard to compete with them.
[01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:48.940]  And the media, in general, is not going through a good time,
[01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:52.940]  and some publications are going through a terrible time.
[01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:55.760]  And even, and I think this might be why you laugh,
[01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:59.300]  is even publications that are thriving or being successful
[01:55:00.220 --> 01:55:03.600]  don't have the sort of budgets for salaries
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:05.520]  that maybe Apple does.
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:09.720]  Right, I think that's a fair assumption to make, yes.
[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:12.720]  TechCrunch is doing okay, but yeah,
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:15.760]  we definitely don't have $160 billion in the bank
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:18.740]  if we need to juice some salaries here and there.
[01:55:19.740 --> 01:55:21.720]  I mean, I think it's more interesting in light
[01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:23.040]  of kind of the overall.
[01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:25.320]  And I've had, excuse me, pardon me,
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:27.360]  I had a chat with my colleague Drew Olanoff,
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:29.720]  who we've hired him back.
[01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:30.980]  He used to work at TechCrunch,
[01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:32.160]  and I liked working with Drew.
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:34.200]  I used to work with him at the Nextweb as well.
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:36.360]  But Drew has spent some time in comms.
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:41.020]  He was actually in, with startups, managing community
[01:55:41.020 --> 01:55:43.200]  and doing comms before he was ever a writer,
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:44.600]  and then kind of went back to it for a while,
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:47.880]  worked at Yahoo for a while and handled comms over there.
[01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:51.500]  Was recently at a couple startups and stuff like that,
[01:55:51.500 --> 01:55:53.880]  but just really had a desire to write again,
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:55.240]  and I'm really happy about that,
[01:55:55.240 --> 01:55:57.200]  because I was able to work with him again,
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:55:58.960]  because he's actually, he's got a great mind
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:00.060]  and thinks about this stuff great.
[01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:03.080]  And because of his work there, he's got good perspective.
[01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:06.040]  So I honestly think that that experience
[01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:10.200]  on both sides of the line makes you a more savvy reporter,
[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:13.640]  makes you understand what companies are saying
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:17.400]  when they say certain things, when they're BSing you.
[01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:21.520]  Your BS detector is better, I think, in general.
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:24.240]  But I don't think that it's one of those things
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:29.240]  that it's impossible to be honest or be good at your job
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:32.680]  if there's ever a possibility of you crossing that line
[01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:33.520]  back and forth,
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:36.280]  because I think that assumes people are automatons,
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:38.360]  and that there's no editorial direction
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:40.120]  and no editor going like,
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:42.480]  hey, should we be pushing harder on this?
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:45.060]  And it's just nobody's paying attention or whatever.
[01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:46.860]  So I think that there's lots of implications there
[01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:50.260]  if you're saying this can never happen.
[01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:51.900]  Yeah, that you're part of a tribe
[01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:53.820]  and that you've somehow betrayed your tribe
[01:56:53.820 --> 01:56:55.280]  by switching to the other side.
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:56.520]  I mean, I think that's nonsense.
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:56:58.080]  I mean, and it starts really at the top.
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:01.680]  I mean, Steve Dowling got to Apple
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:03.480]  from I believe directly,
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:08.480]  like he was the CNBC Silicon Valley correspondent.
[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:13.080]  So he went right from reporting on companies like Apple
[01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:17.300]  for TV to being, now he's the head of PR.
[01:57:18.140 --> 01:57:22.060]  And I can't help but think that maybe there's a little,
[01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:23.880]  even though a lot of the hires that they've had
[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:25.380]  have not been for PR,
[01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:28.720]  and supposedly, as reported by Mark Gurman,
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:30.480]  that's what Etherington's doing,
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:33.960]  or you know, but it wouldn't surprise me
[01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:35.800]  that under Dowling's leadership
[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:37.840]  that they might go more in that direction
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:40.300]  just because that's how he got there.
[01:57:40.300 --> 01:57:43.640]  Well, remember too that if you look at Mark's report,
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:47.280]  he reported later on that Josh Loewenson was from The Verge,
[01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:49.520]  was also on the Apple beat at CNET.
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:51.200]  He also was hired.
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:52.740]  Right around the same time Darryl was hired,
[01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:55.000]  it looks like, from the report.
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.040]  And I don't know anything about that,
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:57:58.840]  but it seems like you could be right
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:02.080]  in that there's a streak there of that.
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:04.080]  Obviously, as somebody in this industry
[01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:06.800]  who works with other Apple reporters,
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:08.840]  and pays attention to the company,
[01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:10.520]  it's been really obvious to me
[01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:12.200]  that they've been snapping up Apple reporters,
[01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:13.120]  as I'm sure you know.
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:14.560]  I mean, they hired like Chris Breen,
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:19.560]  and they hired Anand and Brian from AnandTech,
[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:22.540]  and not all of those, as you mentioned,
[01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:23.800]  have been for comm's position.
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:24.640]  Right, supposedly.
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:26.600]  But it seems like they have been raping and pillaging,
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:29.400]  oh, excuse me, pillaging the, you know,
[01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:31.800]  I don't wanna lighten that term by using it,
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:33.280]  but you know, in the Viking sense,
[01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:36.000]  they've been pillaging the media village, you know?
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.080]  And I think that that's,
[01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:39.360]  it's evident that that's what they're doing.
[01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:41.220]  Whether that's like, Steve is like,
[01:58:41.220 --> 01:58:43.840]  hey, these guys are, these are the people we need to get,
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:45.160]  or what, I don't know, you know?
[01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:48.600]  Yeah, and I know John Seth from Mac,
[01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:50.480]  and this was also in Germin's story yesterday,
[01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:53.860]  he's not working in PR, he's working at Apple University.
[01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:56.700]  And another one that wasn't mentioned,
[01:58:56.700 --> 01:58:59.440]  and isn't really a media hire, but it sort of is,
[01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:02.300]  it was, and I feel like he's just, you know,
[01:59:02.300 --> 01:59:03.860]  like so many people when they go to Apple,
[01:59:03.860 --> 01:59:07.780]  he's outside their walls, he's gone very quiet,
[01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:09.980]  is Michael Gartenberg.
[01:59:09.980 --> 01:59:11.500]  Oh, right, yeah, that's right.
[01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:16.240]  Who was an analyst, and was the rare gem
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:20.500]  of an Apple analyst who was really smart and insightful,
[01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:23.940]  and wrote very clearly in normal,
[01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:27.060]  you know, straightforward language.
[01:59:27.060 --> 01:59:28.940]  And so, yeah, of course that's why they hired him,
[01:59:28.940 --> 01:59:30.980]  because he was the good one, right?
[01:59:30.980 --> 01:59:32.500]  Right, right, but my thing is,
[01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:34.340]  they're shooting themselves in the damn foot,
[01:59:34.340 --> 01:59:36.740]  because there's not gonna be anybody left outside
[01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:39.400]  who understands their business,
[01:59:39.400 --> 01:59:41.940]  and can be moderated about the way that they report on it.
[01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:42.780]  Yeah, Gartenberg.
[01:59:42.780 --> 01:59:44.660]  Like, it's just going crazy.
[01:59:44.660 --> 01:59:49.280]  Gartenberg doesn't work in PR, he is in Schiller's group,
[01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:51.200]  but doing what, I don't know.
[01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:53.140]  So he's, you know, somewhere in product marketing.
[01:59:53.140 --> 01:59:54.140]  Oh, okay, gotcha.
[01:59:54.140 --> 01:59:54.980]  Which is.
[01:59:54.980 --> 01:59:55.800]  Yeah, I mean, it makes sense
[01:59:55.800 --> 01:59:56.740]  that they would bring those people on
[01:59:56.740 --> 01:59:57.860]  that understand their business,
[01:59:57.860 --> 01:59:59.980]  and have an insight, right,
[01:59:59.980 --> 02:00:02.140]  that they can tap into internally.
[02:00:02.140 --> 02:00:04.620]  It just seems funny to me, because it's,
[02:00:04.620 --> 02:00:07.260]  they're like, if you hire all of the reporters
[02:00:07.260 --> 02:00:09.260]  that are able to write about you
[02:00:09.260 --> 02:00:11.600]  without being histrionic or stupid,
[02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:15.100]  then all you're left with is a bunch of,
[02:00:15.100 --> 02:00:19.460]  of like flag-waving crazies, you know,
[02:00:19.460 --> 02:00:22.060]  who are happy to tromp all over you.
[02:00:22.060 --> 02:00:23.900]  And whatever reason, like, you know,
[02:00:23.900 --> 02:00:26.760]  you could argue that Apple's closed-mouth attitudes
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:30.500]  have maybe, you know, exacerbated that problem.
[02:00:30.500 --> 02:00:33.020]  But whatever the case may be, they, you know,
[02:00:33.020 --> 02:00:38.020]  there's, you're definitely removing pieces from the board
[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:40.700]  that could be, not advocates,
[02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:41.680]  because that's not their job,
[02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:43.320]  and hopefully it's not their job,
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:45.300]  but could report on it with intelligence
[02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:46.260]  and with moderation.
[02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:47.840]  And when they have criticisms,
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:50.620]  they are based in a contextual understanding
[02:00:50.620 --> 02:00:52.460]  of the way the company actually works,
[02:00:52.460 --> 02:00:55.140]  not the way that you make it work
[02:00:55.140 --> 02:00:57.040]  through intellectual dishonesty, you know,
[02:00:57.040 --> 02:00:58.220]  when you're reporting on it.
[02:00:58.220 --> 02:01:00.140]  And so I think that there's something,
[02:01:00.140 --> 02:01:01.460]  I don't know, you know, some people are like,
[02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:03.460]  hey, they're smart, they need to go there.
[02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:05.220]  And then Mike, you know, on the other side,
[02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:07.500]  I say, well, if they're smart,
[02:01:07.500 --> 02:01:08.980]  and you snap them all up,
[02:01:08.980 --> 02:01:11.940]  then all that's left is the dummies, but I don't know.
[02:01:11.940 --> 02:01:13.620]  I'm not calling myself a dummy or you a dummy,
[02:01:13.620 --> 02:01:15.380]  but you know, eventually.
[02:01:15.380 --> 02:01:16.420]  Eventually that's all that's left.
[02:01:16.420 --> 02:01:18.020]  I know another good one who left,
[02:01:18.020 --> 02:01:20.260]  not for Apple though, was Ellis Hamburger,
[02:01:20.260 --> 02:01:23.540]  who left The Verge for Snapchat.
[02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:25.180]  I guess he's, I don't even know what he's doing.
[02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:27.900]  I guess he's running PR for them or something, but.
[02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:28.940]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:01:28.940 --> 02:01:30.020]  I don't know exactly what he's doing,
[02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:30.920]  but yeah, he did leave.
[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:34.740]  I mean, he obviously kind of saw the possibilities
[02:01:34.740 --> 02:01:36.980]  and understood what they were kind of after
[02:01:36.980 --> 02:01:39.420]  a little sooner than a lot of people, I think.
[02:01:39.420 --> 02:01:41.580]  I was nodding along with a lot of stuff
[02:01:41.580 --> 02:01:42.420]  when he was writing about them,
[02:01:42.420 --> 02:01:43.260]  and they probably were too.
[02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:46.620]  So I think that's probably why they snapped him up,
[02:01:46.620 --> 02:01:50.340]  but yeah, it's definitely a trend, a wider trend.
[02:01:50.340 --> 02:01:51.400]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:53.620]  And it's, you know, and again, like you said,
[02:01:53.620 --> 02:01:56.740]  and you're in the hot seat for it running TechCrunch
[02:01:56.740 --> 02:02:00.660]  is that it's one thing for you to be,
[02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:03.980]  if you're pursuing someone who you see as a good writer,
[02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:06.380]  it's one thing when you're competing
[02:02:06.380 --> 02:02:09.780]  against other publications with, you know,
[02:02:09.780 --> 02:02:10.940]  roughly in the same business,
[02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:14.580]  and another one you're competing against startups
[02:02:14.580 --> 02:02:17.140]  like Snapchat that have raised millions
[02:02:17.140 --> 02:02:19.140]  and millions of dollars, or a company like Apple
[02:02:19.140 --> 02:02:21.900]  that while we're sitting here talking about it
[02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:24.580]  has made tens of millions of dollars.
[02:02:24.580 --> 02:02:25.940]  They've made more money than we'll ever make
[02:02:25.940 --> 02:02:26.780]  in our entire lives.
[02:02:26.780 --> 02:02:29.460]  Right, while we've been talking on this episode.
[02:02:29.460 --> 02:02:30.580]  Right, exactly.
[02:02:30.580 --> 02:02:31.820]  It is hard, it is hard.
[02:02:31.820 --> 02:02:33.500]  And you know, when we look for,
[02:02:33.500 --> 02:02:36.180]  and obviously every publication has their own
[02:02:36.180 --> 02:02:38.820]  sort of desires at once, and you'll, you know,
[02:02:38.820 --> 02:02:40.740]  we'll have different desires than once for each position
[02:02:40.740 --> 02:02:44.620]  that we hire for, but we generally hire reporters
[02:02:44.620 --> 02:02:46.620]  for a very specific reason, and that's like,
[02:02:46.620 --> 02:02:50.340]  they're outspoken, they understand what they think,
[02:02:50.340 --> 02:02:52.700]  they understand their spaces extremely well,
[02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:54.900]  and they wanna express them vociferously
[02:02:54.900 --> 02:02:57.940]  in a way that says, this is what I think.
[02:02:57.940 --> 02:03:00.740]  And that's not the way a lot of other publications work.
[02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:02.780]  You know, they hide behind a lot of editorial layers,
[02:03:02.780 --> 02:03:05.020]  everything is leached out by the time you read it,
[02:03:05.020 --> 02:03:08.140]  and so you don't know really whether this is the way,
[02:03:08.140 --> 02:03:11.060]  what the writer's thought process was at all, you know?
[02:03:11.060 --> 02:03:14.500]  And because we work that way, it actually lends itself
[02:03:14.500 --> 02:03:19.300]  towards people like Apple or a startup or a VC firm
[02:03:19.300 --> 02:03:21.580]  or somebody like that, understanding the way
[02:03:21.580 --> 02:03:23.380]  that person's brain works more
[02:03:23.380 --> 02:03:25.660]  than say the Wall Street Journal, right?
[02:03:25.660 --> 02:03:29.060]  So I think we are a higher target for poaching
[02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:32.500]  in that regard, which, you know, people get angry about it,
[02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:37.500]  and they do talk to us and get a little bit,
[02:03:38.700 --> 02:03:40.460]  they throw a lot of shade, let's put it that way,
[02:03:40.460 --> 02:03:44.060]  because people that work at TechCrunch maybe go to work
[02:03:44.060 --> 02:03:46.140]  at a company after they work here.
[02:03:46.140 --> 02:03:49.260]  For me, like I said, I don't begrudge anybody
[02:03:49.260 --> 02:03:51.420]  the ability to try something new,
[02:03:51.420 --> 02:03:54.020]  and then the second aspect of it is I view it
[02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:55.800]  as a compliment because they don't go work
[02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:57.540]  for other media organizations,
[02:03:57.540 --> 02:04:00.980]  because I think that they find the work here
[02:04:00.980 --> 02:04:03.200]  has a lot of freedom, they have a lot of flexibility,
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:07.560]  they have space to create what they wanna create,
[02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:09.900]  and then if they go somewhere else,
[02:04:09.900 --> 02:04:11.500]  it's like walking back into a cage
[02:04:11.500 --> 02:04:13.820]  and shutting the door behind you, you know?
[02:04:13.820 --> 02:04:16.540]  I mean this sincerely, not just because you're here
[02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:18.260]  and I'm blowing smoke up your ass,
[02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:20.820]  but TechCrunch is and always has been,
[02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:22.500]  you know, right from when it started
[02:04:22.500 --> 02:04:27.160]  is Mike Arrington's site, his own personal site,
[02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:29.820]  but it's always been a site where the bylines mattered
[02:04:29.820 --> 02:04:31.860]  in terms of the writer has a voice, you know,
[02:04:31.860 --> 02:04:33.920]  and I see, you know, like I noticed,
[02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:36.860]  I noticed that Drew came back to TechCrunch
[02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:40.600]  because I know his name because he's got a voice,
[02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:43.180]  and you know, all of a sudden I started seeing
[02:04:43.180 --> 02:04:45.820]  by Drew Olenoff again on TechCrunch,
[02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:48.220]  and you know, but I noticed that.
[02:04:48.220 --> 02:04:50.660]  There are a lot of sites where the bylines don't matter,
[02:04:50.660 --> 02:04:53.300]  not in terms of credit, but where you, you know,
[02:04:53.300 --> 02:04:55.620]  you just don't, you don't,
[02:04:55.620 --> 02:04:58.080]  there is no voice from the writer.
[02:04:58.080 --> 02:04:59.420]  There's no personality in it.
[02:04:59.420 --> 02:05:03.900]  It's just like a generic, well watered down house style.
[02:05:04.780 --> 02:05:06.380]  Right, right, exactly.
[02:05:06.380 --> 02:05:09.700]  And I think that there is plenty of room for that,
[02:05:09.700 --> 02:05:12.260]  especially when it comes to sensitive reporting.
[02:05:12.260 --> 02:05:14.100]  I mean, obviously I'm not gonna have a writer come out
[02:05:14.100 --> 02:05:17.740]  with a bombastic take on something that's very sensitive,
[02:05:17.740 --> 02:05:21.860]  like a founder who has, who commits suicide, for instance,
[02:05:21.860 --> 02:05:24.460]  which we've had happen very, very sadly a couple of times
[02:05:24.460 --> 02:05:25.860]  over the past couple of years.
[02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:28.620]  And so that is not a situation where you're gonna do that,
[02:05:28.620 --> 02:05:33.620]  but by and large, the large majority of tech coverage
[02:05:33.860 --> 02:05:35.820]  is very, is one of two things.
[02:05:35.820 --> 02:05:38.300]  It's either incredibly over the top
[02:05:38.300 --> 02:05:40.620]  and intellectually dishonest,
[02:05:40.620 --> 02:05:41.980]  where somebody creates-
[02:05:41.980 --> 02:05:46.980]  A gawker yesterday published an obituary for iTunes.
[02:05:47.060 --> 02:05:49.120]  Oh, good, good, excellent.
[02:05:50.100 --> 02:05:52.800]  You know, and I like, I don't begrudge anybody their angle,
[02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:55.500]  but I just find it really hard
[02:05:55.500 --> 02:05:57.980]  to then take them seriously, right?
[02:05:57.980 --> 02:06:00.060]  And so then there's either that,
[02:06:00.060 --> 02:06:03.100]  or it is the very dry, distant,
[02:06:03.100 --> 02:06:06.020]  I'm gonna hide behind several layers of editorial
[02:06:06.020 --> 02:06:08.020]  so you don't know whether or not
[02:06:08.020 --> 02:06:09.920]  I actually believe this thing.
[02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:13.820]  And my goal is always, if I'm gonna hire a writer,
[02:06:13.820 --> 02:06:15.660]  and if I'm gonna tell a writer what we do
[02:06:15.660 --> 02:06:17.460]  and how I want them to write,
[02:06:17.460 --> 02:06:18.500]  the core of it is,
[02:06:18.500 --> 02:06:20.940]  do you believe what you're about to publish?
[02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:23.540]  And if you don't, then go back to the drawing board,
[02:06:23.540 --> 02:06:24.740]  rethink it, you know?
[02:06:24.740 --> 02:06:28.220]  It's not about what it looks like,
[02:06:28.220 --> 02:06:29.420]  or what it feels like,
[02:06:29.420 --> 02:06:32.820]  or the way people take it.
[02:06:32.820 --> 02:06:33.820]  If you report on something,
[02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:36.140]  you say a certain thing and they trash you, that's fine.
[02:06:36.140 --> 02:06:37.380]  It really doesn't matter.
[02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:39.020]  All that matters is, do you believe it?
[02:06:39.020 --> 02:06:40.060]  Because in the end,
[02:06:40.060 --> 02:06:41.980]  that's why you can go home and sleep at night,
[02:06:41.980 --> 02:06:43.500]  and you can wake up tomorrow,
[02:06:43.500 --> 02:06:44.440]  and we're both happy,
[02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:46.380]  and we smile when we see each other at work,
[02:06:46.380 --> 02:06:49.260]  and we're not all depressed and in our cups
[02:06:49.260 --> 02:06:52.060]  because we're publishing things we don't believe,
[02:06:52.060 --> 02:06:54.740]  or publishing things we don't believe in,
[02:06:54.740 --> 02:06:56.500]  and I think that's the biggest thing.
[02:06:56.500 --> 02:06:57.740]  And that's hard, it's tough,
[02:06:57.740 --> 02:06:59.740]  especially when all this money's at play, you know?
[02:06:59.740 --> 02:07:00.580]  It's just so powered.
[02:07:00.580 --> 02:07:01.780]  Well, what about just the simple metric
[02:07:01.780 --> 02:07:04.940]  of publishing, writing stuff that you wouldn't want to read?
[02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:06.780]  Right, right, exactly.
[02:07:06.780 --> 02:07:09.340]  That, to me, is where if you're,
[02:07:09.340 --> 02:07:11.560]  well, and if you're a writer, a creator,
[02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:12.540]  if you're creating things
[02:07:12.540 --> 02:07:14.700]  that you yourself would not want to consume,
[02:07:14.700 --> 02:07:17.300]  that, to me, is when you're miserable.
[02:07:17.300 --> 02:07:18.140]  I mean, that is-
[02:07:18.140 --> 02:07:19.040]  Yeah, big warning sign.
[02:07:19.040 --> 02:07:21.700]  That's death, to me.
[02:07:21.700 --> 02:07:23.260]  And definitely a warning sign.
[02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:26.860]  That about wraps it up.
[02:07:26.860 --> 02:07:27.700]  Should we talk about,
[02:07:27.700 --> 02:07:29.220]  the only other thing I could think to talk about
[02:07:29.220 --> 02:07:32.260]  would be the two other things I had on my list
[02:07:32.260 --> 02:07:35.140]  were apple.com redesign,
[02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:36.900]  which I don't know that I have a lot to say about,
[02:07:36.900 --> 02:07:40.860]  and the other thing is the Apple Music stuff
[02:07:40.860 --> 02:07:42.500]  that came out yesterday at EQ,
[02:07:42.500 --> 02:07:45.960]  and what's his name, did an interview with USA Today.
[02:07:47.180 --> 02:07:48.020]  Yeah, Eovine.
[02:07:48.020 --> 02:07:49.180]  Eovine.
[02:07:49.180 --> 02:07:51.940]  So they said, do the Apple Music first.
[02:07:51.940 --> 02:07:55.660]  So the news is that they have 11 million subscribers,
[02:07:55.660 --> 02:08:00.420]  but everybody is still in the three-month free period,
[02:08:00.420 --> 02:08:03.500]  so there's no metrics yet
[02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:05.400]  on how many people are actually paying.
[02:08:06.580 --> 02:08:08.220]  But that seems like a good start.
[02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:11.520]  And there was an acknowledgement of,
[02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:12.560]  yes, there's some bugs,
[02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:15.780]  and it's not working great for everybody, and we're on it.
[02:08:15.780 --> 02:08:16.700]  Mm-hmm.
[02:08:16.700 --> 02:08:19.660]  What I can't make up my mind about,
[02:08:19.660 --> 02:08:22.380]  and I just haven't used a lot.
[02:08:22.380 --> 02:08:25.180]  I don't, I don't know, I'm a grumpy old man,
[02:08:25.180 --> 02:08:26.500]  and I don't listen to a lot of music.
[02:08:26.500 --> 02:08:27.940]  I've never really listened to,
[02:08:27.940 --> 02:08:29.740]  I don't listen to music while I work.
[02:08:29.740 --> 02:08:30.620]  Here's the big thing.
[02:08:30.620 --> 02:08:33.060]  I can't write or read while I listen to music,
[02:08:33.060 --> 02:08:34.580]  or I shouldn't say I can't,
[02:08:34.580 --> 02:08:36.580]  but I find it to be distracting.
[02:08:36.580 --> 02:08:39.000]  I like to write and read in silence.
[02:08:40.140 --> 02:08:41.460]  I like to write in silence.
[02:08:41.460 --> 02:08:44.300]  I can listen to music while I read,
[02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:47.020]  but yeah, if I'm writing, I'm not like,
[02:08:47.020 --> 02:08:50.600]  oh, I'm gonna put headphones on and listen to music,
[02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:54.400]  unless, and this is like a very precise thing to digress.
[02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:55.360]  I know we're talking about iTunes,
[02:08:55.360 --> 02:08:58.560]  but I just find this, since you brought it up,
[02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:02.020]  every once in a while, I get this idea to write a story,
[02:09:02.020 --> 02:09:04.060]  and literally the entire story is already done
[02:09:04.060 --> 02:09:05.420]  before I start writing it.
[02:09:05.420 --> 02:09:07.960]  And in that case, I play the music to get me through
[02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:09.480]  actually putting it on the page,
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:11.260]  because it's boring at that point.
[02:09:11.260 --> 02:09:12.100]  Like, you know what I mean?
[02:09:12.100 --> 02:09:13.380]  Actually writing it. I do, I do.
[02:09:13.380 --> 02:09:15.060]  The writing part is boring,
[02:09:15.060 --> 02:09:17.300]  because you're like, ugh, I gotta put all these words down
[02:09:17.300 --> 02:09:20.180]  so other people understand what I'm saying, you know?
[02:09:20.180 --> 02:09:22.060]  And that, then I'll put on some techno,
[02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:24.140]  and I'll blast through it, but yeah.
[02:09:24.140 --> 02:09:26.140]  But if I'm trying to formulate ideas,
[02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:27.300]  I do find it distracting.
[02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:28.140]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:30.420]  Yeah, that's a funny way to put it, though.
[02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:32.680]  In broad sense, I do find that when I write,
[02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:33.860]  that's two types of stories.
[02:09:33.860 --> 02:09:35.540]  There's the one that I already have it,
[02:09:35.540 --> 02:09:37.860]  and it does seem like it's just drudgery,
[02:09:37.860 --> 02:09:39.860]  not drudgery, but work.
[02:09:39.860 --> 02:09:42.020]  It feels like work to get it out.
[02:09:42.020 --> 02:09:44.700]  And then there's the kind where I don't know where I'm going
[02:09:44.700 --> 02:09:47.260]  and it's actually fun to write it,
[02:09:47.260 --> 02:09:49.020]  even though it actually is more work,
[02:09:49.020 --> 02:09:52.260]  because I actually have to go back and change it,
[02:09:52.260 --> 02:09:55.320]  because the course of writing it
[02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:58.260]  is how I formulate the final idea.
[02:09:58.260 --> 02:09:59.080]  Exactly.
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:01.820]  You teach yourself what you meant by writing.
[02:10:01.820 --> 02:10:02.660]  So I...
[02:10:02.660 --> 02:10:03.860]  And then at the end of it, you're like,
[02:10:03.860 --> 02:10:05.340]  oh, I meant this, then I gotta go back
[02:10:05.340 --> 02:10:06.980]  and readjust all this stuff.
[02:10:06.980 --> 02:10:09.620]  So a quick spoiler.
[02:10:09.620 --> 02:10:11.700]  It's an article I'm writing for Daring Fireball.
[02:10:11.700 --> 02:10:12.700]  It isn't out yet.
[02:10:12.700 --> 02:10:14.300]  It might be a race against time,
[02:10:14.300 --> 02:10:17.360]  whether it's out before this episode of the podcast is out.
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:19.180]  But I'm just writing a post that's just,
[02:10:19.180 --> 02:10:22.420]  here's my guessing on what the new iPhone lineup
[02:10:22.420 --> 02:10:23.640]  will look like next month.
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:27.940]  And I started it by trying to get to where
[02:10:28.980 --> 02:10:31.300]  Molte and I last week on the show were both thinking
[02:10:31.300 --> 02:10:35.300]  maybe they would do a four-inch iPhone 6C,
[02:10:35.300 --> 02:10:38.460]  sort of like the internals of the iPod touches
[02:10:38.460 --> 02:10:42.240]  that just came out, and the A8, and the four-inch size.
[02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:44.420]  And that was what I started writing the article about.
[02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:46.700]  And as I wrote the article, I came to the conclusion
[02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:49.180]  that that's not gonna happen.
[02:10:51.180 --> 02:10:52.300]  Yeah, I love that, though.
[02:10:52.300 --> 02:10:53.140]  I know.
[02:10:53.140 --> 02:10:55.100]  That's the great thing, that discovery is fun.
[02:10:55.100 --> 02:10:57.220]  But I actually had to then go back to the beginning
[02:10:57.220 --> 02:10:59.600]  and rewrite almost everything.
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:01.520]  Because I started by trying to make the argument
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:02.920]  that this is why I think they might do this.
[02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:04.580]  And as I wrote the article,
[02:11:04.580 --> 02:11:07.420]  it's like by forcing myself to make sentences out of it,
[02:11:07.420 --> 02:11:09.260]  it's like, oh, you know what, that's not gonna happen.
[02:11:09.260 --> 02:11:12.680]  There'd be leaks of the components by now,
[02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:15.340]  and there are no leaks, so it's not gonna happen.
[02:11:15.340 --> 02:11:17.580]  Well, that's called being intellectually honest, right?
[02:11:17.580 --> 02:11:18.900]  Right, but it's fun.
[02:11:18.900 --> 02:11:21.500]  The upside of that is you try to prove
[02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:23.700]  and you try to stretch the facts and truth
[02:11:23.700 --> 02:11:26.020]  of what you know to be true to fit a narrative
[02:11:26.020 --> 02:11:28.260]  that you had created before you even started.
[02:11:28.260 --> 02:11:29.980]  And so there's that, too.
[02:11:29.980 --> 02:11:30.820]  It's fun, though.
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:36.180]  So anyway, my daily life, I don't listen to a lot of music.
[02:11:36.180 --> 02:11:40.660]  I work an awful lot if by dicking around on the web
[02:11:40.660 --> 02:11:42.700]  and linking to things you can call at work.
[02:11:42.700 --> 02:11:44.420]  And when I'm doing that, I'm not listening to music.
[02:11:44.420 --> 02:11:45.640]  I'm constantly waiting for somebody
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:47.660]  to make me go back and dig ditches.
[02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:49.260]  I mean, really, every day, I'm like,
[02:11:49.260 --> 02:11:51.300]  okay, well, when's the time to go back to work?
[02:11:51.300 --> 02:11:52.140]  Yeah.
[02:11:52.140 --> 02:11:53.660]  So as long as I feel that way,
[02:11:53.660 --> 02:11:55.500]  I think we're okay as long as we feel that way.
[02:11:55.500 --> 02:11:56.340]  Anyhow, go ahead.
[02:11:56.340 --> 02:11:57.860]  And then when I'm listening to stuff,
[02:11:57.860 --> 02:11:59.680]  because I'm bored and I want something to listen to,
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:01.860]  it's almost always podcasts.
[02:12:01.860 --> 02:12:03.360]  And so I don't listen to a lot of music.
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:06.100]  And so I've played around with Apple Music
[02:12:06.100 --> 02:12:09.500]  and it works for me, but I don't use it enough
[02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:11.540]  to have run into these bugs that people have run into.
[02:12:11.540 --> 02:12:12.360]  So I just don't know.
[02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:14.760]  I don't feel like I'm in a position to judge.
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:15.960]  This is where I'm getting at.
[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:20.060]  Is this a sort of rough 1.0
[02:12:20.060 --> 02:12:21.620]  and there's some kinks to be worked out,
[02:12:21.620 --> 02:12:24.840]  but they're on track and yes, it's just bugs.
[02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:25.680]  It's a 1.0.
[02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:27.500]  They shipped when they shipped and they'll fix it.
[02:12:27.500 --> 02:12:29.140]  Or is this a disaster
[02:12:29.140 --> 02:12:31.960]  and they've got a permanent mess on their hands?
[02:12:33.220 --> 02:12:34.180]  I don't know.
[02:12:34.180 --> 02:12:37.480]  I see people espousing both opinions.
[02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:38.840]  I mean, like I just joked,
[02:12:40.660 --> 02:12:45.540]  Gizmodo published an obituary for iTunes yesterday.
[02:12:45.540 --> 02:12:48.060]  So I tend to think that's hyperbole,
[02:12:48.060 --> 02:12:49.620]  but I don't know that I've used it enough
[02:12:49.620 --> 02:12:51.780]  to form an opinion on it.
[02:12:51.780 --> 02:12:55.100]  I mean, I think everybody who's used it
[02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:58.180]  for any period of time understands that iTunes
[02:12:58.180 --> 02:13:02.220]  is not the most well-written piece of software anymore.
[02:13:02.220 --> 02:13:05.060]  And that's no real one person's fault necessarily,
[02:13:05.060 --> 02:13:07.780]  although you could probably find somebody
[02:13:07.780 --> 02:13:10.980]  in the chain somewhere who you could quote unquote blame.
[02:13:10.980 --> 02:13:12.380]  But I think that it's been asked
[02:13:12.380 --> 02:13:15.180]  to do so many different things by now
[02:13:15.180 --> 02:13:18.680]  that it's impossible for it to execute on any of them
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:22.900]  with any real sense of competency.
[02:13:22.900 --> 02:13:24.200]  It just does stuff.
[02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:27.020]  It doesn't really do stuff well.
[02:13:27.020 --> 02:13:28.700]  And I think that that is part
[02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:30.540]  of what we're running up against here.
[02:13:30.540 --> 02:13:35.260]  We're gonna be smashing Apple Music into iTunes,
[02:13:35.260 --> 02:13:37.460]  which is the argument for separating it, right?
[02:13:37.460 --> 02:13:40.740]  And having an Apple Music app or whatever the case may be,
[02:13:40.740 --> 02:13:43.220]  which I think honestly would lead to more complexity,
[02:13:43.220 --> 02:13:44.760]  so I'm not hugely fond,
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:49.220]  but you could easily see a music app and a videos app, right?
[02:13:49.220 --> 02:13:52.680]  And the videos app contains your video library,
[02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:54.060]  just like it does in iOS,
[02:13:54.060 --> 02:13:57.260]  and the music app contained radio and your music
[02:13:57.260 --> 02:13:58.380]  and all that stuff.
[02:13:58.380 --> 02:14:01.300]  And then the stores were then attached to each of them.
[02:14:01.300 --> 02:14:03.820]  You could even look at the apple.com redesign
[02:14:03.820 --> 02:14:06.500]  as a sort of indicator as to the way they think about it.
[02:14:06.500 --> 02:14:09.140]  And right now, your music collection
[02:14:09.140 --> 02:14:10.760]  is separate from the store,
[02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:13.500]  but with Apple Music, it doesn't have to be, right?
[02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:17.060]  It literally is, it could be one unit,
[02:14:17.060 --> 02:14:19.600]  and you could be listening to a song
[02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:20.780]  and add it to your collection,
[02:14:20.780 --> 02:14:23.500]  which is totally possible with Apple Music right now.
[02:14:23.500 --> 02:14:24.740]  So there's just lots of indicators
[02:14:24.740 --> 02:14:26.980]  that a standalone app could really work well
[02:14:26.980 --> 02:14:29.280]  and could mesh better than it currently does,
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:30.520]  where you switch back and forth.
[02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:34.880]  All I know is that my movie library is pretty big,
[02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:36.940]  and iTunes handles it incredibly poorly,
[02:14:36.940 --> 02:14:39.140]  and Apple TV handles it even worse.
[02:14:39.140 --> 02:14:40.820]  Yeah, I'm living in the same.
[02:14:40.820 --> 02:14:42.460]  954 movies.
[02:14:42.460 --> 02:14:43.300]  Wait, how many?
[02:14:43.300 --> 02:14:45.060]  And 954.
[02:14:45.060 --> 02:14:48.580]  Wow, and they are all bought through iTunes, or?
[02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:49.420]  Oh, hell no.
[02:14:49.420 --> 02:14:50.260]  No. Good God.
[02:14:50.260 --> 02:14:51.080]  No.
[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:51.920]  Yeah, no.
[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:54.380]  Some of them, but I think a good portion of them,
[02:14:54.380 --> 02:14:59.380]  maybe 20% are purchased for iTunes,
[02:14:59.820 --> 02:15:02.700]  but a large majority of them are ripped
[02:15:02.700 --> 02:15:05.880]  from Blu-rays, DVDs, other kinds of things.
[02:15:05.880 --> 02:15:07.420]  So they're not the most amazing quality,
[02:15:07.420 --> 02:15:09.380]  but a lot of times, I mean, they're good enough
[02:15:09.380 --> 02:15:11.620]  for me to watch every once in a great while
[02:15:11.620 --> 02:15:12.760]  when I want to watch it,
[02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:14.580]  but it's just like I digitized my collection.
[02:15:14.580 --> 02:15:15.420]  That's all I did.
[02:15:15.420 --> 02:15:16.260]  I figured out what worked for me.
[02:15:16.260 --> 02:15:18.780]  And you keep them on a Mac that's on your home network,
[02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:23.420]  and iTunes supposedly can, through your iTunes,
[02:15:23.420 --> 02:15:24.780]  through your iCloud account,
[02:15:24.780 --> 02:15:27.860]  you can see them from your Apple TV.
[02:15:27.860 --> 02:15:32.540]  Exactly, but on the Apple TV, when you have 954 movies,
[02:15:32.540 --> 02:15:36.300]  the list scrolls for an eternity, right?
[02:15:36.300 --> 02:15:37.720]  It's just a scrollable list.
[02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:39.600]  There's no genre breakdowns.
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:42.220]  The metadata's there, but there's no genre breakdowns.
[02:15:42.220 --> 02:15:46.060]  There's no way to even look at them in cover form.
[02:15:46.060 --> 02:15:49.080]  It's literally just an endlessly scrolling list of names.
[02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:53.020]  It's the worst possible interface for a large movie library.
[02:15:53.020 --> 02:15:54.520]  Yeah, it's not good.
[02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:55.360]  It just sucks.
[02:15:56.860 --> 02:16:00.620]  Out of laziness, I'd still buy Blu-rays for movies
[02:16:00.620 --> 02:16:03.200]  that I truly love or expect to love.
[02:16:04.140 --> 02:16:06.200]  Criterion Collection, I've got all the Kubrick stuff
[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:07.820]  on Blu-ray and stuff like that,
[02:16:07.820 --> 02:16:12.820]  but for the most part, if it's just regular crap,
[02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:14.820]  we just buy, and we're gonna buy it.
[02:16:14.820 --> 02:16:16.000]  We buy the iTunes version.
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:19.000]  So we've got, I figured it's like, holy cow,
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:22.340]  that's a lot of money, but we've been doing it for years.
[02:16:22.340 --> 02:16:24.660]  We've got a little over 300 movies
[02:16:24.660 --> 02:16:26.400]  that we've bought from iTunes.
[02:16:27.620 --> 02:16:30.660]  And that's the ones, that's not rips.
[02:16:30.660 --> 02:16:31.900]  These aren't on a Mac.
[02:16:31.900 --> 02:16:33.480]  These are the ones we bought from iTunes,
[02:16:33.480 --> 02:16:38.480]  but on Apple TV, this is the current Apple TV,
[02:16:38.580 --> 02:16:41.100]  when you go to all movies, it's like, I don't know,
[02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:43.620]  10 seconds before the list comes up,
[02:16:43.620 --> 02:16:45.740]  before anything comes up.
[02:16:45.740 --> 02:16:48.340]  So it's like you almost have to,
[02:16:48.340 --> 02:16:50.460]  it's easy to get to the one you just,
[02:16:50.460 --> 02:16:51.860]  the most recent two or three,
[02:16:51.860 --> 02:16:53.260]  because they're up there at the top
[02:16:53.260 --> 02:16:55.260]  in the little shortcut section.
[02:16:55.260 --> 02:16:58.380]  But if you wanna look at a movie that you bought years ago,
[02:16:58.380 --> 02:17:01.140]  it's, it really stinks.
[02:17:01.140 --> 02:17:02.780]  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, exactly.
[02:17:02.780 --> 02:17:04.140]  If it's something you bought recently,
[02:17:04.140 --> 02:17:07.140]  I mean, the cycle we go through with my daughter
[02:17:07.140 --> 02:17:10.300]  is we'll, she'll see, I'll leave,
[02:17:10.300 --> 02:17:12.820]  why don't you try this, try this movie?
[02:17:12.820 --> 02:17:13.780]  And she'll hate it, right?
[02:17:13.780 --> 02:17:15.780]  She obviously detests it the first time we watch it.
[02:17:15.780 --> 02:17:17.540]  And then she'll start asking me to watch it again,
[02:17:17.540 --> 02:17:18.840]  and she'll watch it over and over and over again
[02:17:18.840 --> 02:17:20.200]  until we watch something else.
[02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:22.700]  So like I recently introduced her to Jameson the Giant Peach
[02:17:22.700 --> 02:17:24.660]  and at first she was totally disinterested,
[02:17:24.660 --> 02:17:26.740]  you know, completely, no thanks.
[02:17:26.740 --> 02:17:29.980]  But then now she watches it like once or twice a day, right?
[02:17:29.980 --> 02:17:32.340]  And the same thing with Iron Giant,
[02:17:32.340 --> 02:17:33.680]  where, you know, those are the movies
[02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:35.400]  she alternates between right now.
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:37.280]  When previously did that, it was like Monsters, Inc.
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:38.660]  and you know, so on and so forth, right?
[02:17:38.660 --> 02:17:41.180]  There'll be a thing that is she's interested in,
[02:17:41.180 --> 02:17:43.780]  so when she wants to watch a movie that day,
[02:17:43.780 --> 02:17:45.360]  you know, well, okay, what do you wanna watch?
[02:17:45.360 --> 02:17:48.260]  You know, and she'll be like, oh, you know, giant, right?
[02:17:48.260 --> 02:17:49.640]  Well, those are right at the top.
[02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:52.540]  But if it's anything else, it is a drill down job
[02:17:52.540 --> 02:17:53.840]  to get to the rest of it.
[02:17:53.840 --> 02:17:56.620]  So like regardless of what your use case is,
[02:17:56.620 --> 02:17:58.140]  whether it's just your kid watched movie
[02:17:58.140 --> 02:18:01.340]  or you know, you're a serious movie collector,
[02:18:01.340 --> 02:18:04.020]  I don't think either people are really being serviced well
[02:18:04.020 --> 02:18:05.680]  at this point, you know?
[02:18:05.680 --> 02:18:08.140]  And I think that there needs to be a severe revamp there
[02:18:08.140 --> 02:18:10.080]  on the Apple TV, but I think that part of that
[02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:11.740]  is in iTunes as well.
[02:18:11.740 --> 02:18:13.620]  Because iTunes, at the moment,
[02:18:13.620 --> 02:18:15.260]  it's not all that effective either.
[02:18:15.260 --> 02:18:19.020]  It's either a list or a list of covers
[02:18:19.020 --> 02:18:20.940]  that does not scroll well.
[02:18:20.940 --> 02:18:22.780]  It scrolls really, really poorly.
[02:18:22.780 --> 02:18:24.620]  Yeah, and it takes a long time to load.
[02:18:24.620 --> 02:18:25.980]  Yeah, it's, I don't know.
[02:18:25.980 --> 02:18:28.780]  Anyway, I have a very strong feeling
[02:18:28.780 --> 02:18:33.060]  that there will be a new answer to that problem in a month.
[02:18:34.740 --> 02:18:36.200]  Yeah, I think there has to be.
[02:18:36.200 --> 02:18:39.940]  I don't really, I'm in the same boat as you
[02:18:39.940 --> 02:18:41.660]  as far as Apple Music goes.
[02:18:41.660 --> 02:18:45.220]  Like I don't have a really comprehensive list
[02:18:45.220 --> 02:18:47.300]  of my gripes or anything like that
[02:18:47.300 --> 02:18:49.260]  because I use it really casually.
[02:18:49.260 --> 02:18:51.060]  You know, I have a music library,
[02:18:51.060 --> 02:18:53.820]  but most of my music library is classic rock
[02:18:53.820 --> 02:18:56.900]  because that's when I was buying a lot of music on CDs
[02:18:56.900 --> 02:18:59.580]  and ripped them, I was buying a lot of classic rock.
[02:18:59.580 --> 02:19:01.580]  And my musical taste had changed significantly.
[02:19:01.580 --> 02:19:03.180]  I think the last three albums I bought
[02:19:03.180 --> 02:19:06.320]  were like Mumford & Sons, Brandon Flowers' new album,
[02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:07.780]  and the Kung Fury soundtrack.
[02:19:07.780 --> 02:19:09.980]  So like I'm all over the map now,
[02:19:09.980 --> 02:19:13.540]  but I very rarely go through my music library
[02:19:13.540 --> 02:19:14.800]  and play stuff anymore.
[02:19:14.800 --> 02:19:17.860]  I generally pop on RDO and then just listen
[02:19:17.860 --> 02:19:20.540]  to the popular stuff, right?
[02:19:20.540 --> 02:19:21.920]  Like what's new, what's interesting?
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:23.680]  So I can discover new people and go like,
[02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:27.420]  oh, I like, you know, Wale, or I like, you know,
[02:19:27.420 --> 02:19:29.220]  Matt and Kim, or I like whatever these new,
[02:19:29.220 --> 02:19:31.460]  you know, Walter Sobchak or some new artists
[02:19:31.460 --> 02:19:33.660]  that I am pretty excited about now.
[02:19:33.660 --> 02:19:35.700]  And so that discovery aspect of things
[02:19:35.700 --> 02:19:38.680]  is serviced fine for me by clicking on the radio tab
[02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:41.420]  and just, you know, letting it play
[02:19:41.420 --> 02:19:44.140]  or going to the for new tab and just clicking on something.
[02:19:44.140 --> 02:19:46.500]  So for me, I'm pretty easy.
[02:19:46.500 --> 02:19:49.140]  So I'm not the right person to be all critical about it,
[02:19:49.140 --> 02:19:50.940]  you know, because I'm an easy pleaser.
[02:19:55.280 --> 02:19:56.660]  That's the first thing that comes to mind
[02:19:56.660 --> 02:19:58.860]  when I think of you, Matthew, easy pleaser.
[02:20:00.220 --> 02:20:04.820]  In this one small, narrow niche I am, yeah.
[02:20:04.820 --> 02:20:07.180]  What do you think about the new Apple.com?
[02:20:07.180 --> 02:20:08.940]  Maybe we can wrap it up.
[02:20:08.940 --> 02:20:10.640]  Yeah, yeah, okay, so I think it's good.
[02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:12.220]  I mean, I don't, like you,
[02:20:12.220 --> 02:20:13.860]  I don't have a whole lot to say about it.
[02:20:13.860 --> 02:20:18.860]  I mean, I think it is, it's going to be a nice statement
[02:20:19.300 --> 02:20:22.620]  for anybody that has a separate store to get over it
[02:20:22.620 --> 02:20:26.560]  and to integrate their exploration, curation,
[02:20:26.560 --> 02:20:28.100]  and store all into one.
[02:20:28.100 --> 02:20:29.760]  Like there's no reason to have this whole
[02:20:29.760 --> 02:20:31.540]  like showroom mentality.
[02:20:31.540 --> 02:20:33.180]  I think you put it that way in your.
[02:20:33.180 --> 02:20:34.400]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:20:34.400 --> 02:20:36.460]  But I think that's, I think that's accurate.
[02:20:36.460 --> 02:20:38.300]  I think that the reason though,
[02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:43.300]  it was more of an engineering issue
[02:20:44.420 --> 02:20:48.600]  than a decision that that's the way they should do it.
[02:20:48.600 --> 02:20:51.540]  It was, it just sort of evolved that way
[02:20:51.540 --> 02:20:54.980]  and that they had this convoluted web object system
[02:20:54.980 --> 02:20:56.540]  that they wrote in house for the store
[02:20:56.540 --> 02:20:58.260]  that did a lot of cool things
[02:20:58.260 --> 02:21:00.140]  and couldn't be easily replaced,
[02:21:00.140 --> 02:21:01.500]  but it also had a lot of problems.
[02:21:01.500 --> 02:21:03.400]  And so to me the most interesting thing
[02:21:03.400 --> 02:21:05.660]  we could talk about, and a lot of people have asked,
[02:21:05.660 --> 02:21:06.860]  so I feel like if we don't,
[02:21:06.860 --> 02:21:08.820]  it's the one thing I know we almost have to talk about,
[02:21:08.820 --> 02:21:11.860]  is are they still going to take the store down
[02:21:11.860 --> 02:21:13.580]  when they have like a press event?
[02:21:14.780 --> 02:21:17.220]  And long story short, the deal is,
[02:21:17.220 --> 02:21:20.380]  is that that started because technically
[02:21:20.380 --> 02:21:23.340]  they had to take the store down for hours
[02:21:23.340 --> 02:21:26.460]  to make certain, there were certain types of changes
[02:21:26.460 --> 02:21:29.740]  that had involved taking the entire store down for hours.
[02:21:29.740 --> 02:21:32.860]  And part of it was the way that there are different stores
[02:21:32.860 --> 02:21:34.920]  around the world for different currencies
[02:21:34.920 --> 02:21:35.760]  and stuff like that.
[02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:39.200]  And part of it was just the way that it was made.
[02:21:40.140 --> 02:21:43.060]  And that explains why there are times,
[02:21:43.060 --> 02:21:44.580]  you know, there's almost like a bat signal,
[02:21:44.580 --> 02:21:45.860]  like the Apple store is down,
[02:21:45.860 --> 02:21:50.420]  like if it's down the morning of WWDC's keynote,
[02:21:50.420 --> 02:21:51.240]  or if-
[02:21:51.240 --> 02:21:52.080]  New products.
[02:21:52.080 --> 02:21:54.300]  Right, or if it's down next September,
[02:21:54.300 --> 02:21:57.700]  you know, I don't know what date it's the consensus guess
[02:21:57.700 --> 02:21:59.700]  for when the, you know, event's gonna be,
[02:21:59.700 --> 02:22:01.940]  you know, I don't know, looking at my calendar,
[02:22:01.940 --> 02:22:06.540]  I'm thinking maybe September 14th or something,
[02:22:06.540 --> 02:22:08.580]  you know, September 14th, September 15th, you know,
[02:22:08.580 --> 02:22:11.620]  but if the press events go out or invites go out,
[02:22:11.620 --> 02:22:12.700]  you know, the week before
[02:22:12.700 --> 02:22:14.220]  and the store goes down that morning,
[02:22:14.220 --> 02:22:15.860]  well, yeah, everybody knows that.
[02:22:15.860 --> 02:22:18.000]  But there were times, you know, for years
[02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:19.680]  where like on a random Wednesday,
[02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:21.420]  the Apple store goes down for an hour
[02:22:21.420 --> 02:22:24.580]  and people get excited and, you know, what's going on
[02:22:24.580 --> 02:22:26.740]  and then it comes back up and it was nothing.
[02:22:28.100 --> 02:22:31.360]  Right, so my understanding is that those days are over,
[02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:33.580]  like the new engineering that's going on here
[02:22:33.580 --> 02:22:35.980]  is they're not gonna have to take the store down
[02:22:37.780 --> 02:22:41.460]  for just because they have to.
[02:22:41.460 --> 02:22:44.300]  But my guess is they'll still do something like that
[02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:47.420]  because it evolved into a way to make people excited,
[02:22:47.420 --> 02:22:50.060]  you know, it builds anticipation.
[02:22:50.060 --> 02:22:53.340]  And quite frankly, if they're announcing new iPhones
[02:22:53.340 --> 02:22:57.180]  this morning, they don't want you to buy an old iPhone,
[02:22:57.180 --> 02:22:58.020]  you know what I mean?
[02:22:58.020 --> 02:22:59.220]  Because they know you're gonna send it, you know,
[02:22:59.220 --> 02:23:00.340]  you're gonna be mad and they're gonna have
[02:23:00.340 --> 02:23:03.620]  to cancel your order and send it back anyway.
[02:23:03.620 --> 02:23:06.540]  Yeah, so maybe they just turn off the buy button, right?
[02:23:07.540 --> 02:23:09.520]  I mean, I think that they're,
[02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:12.420]  I asked about this and got no comment,
[02:23:12.420 --> 02:23:14.300]  but you know, about the whole like,
[02:23:14.300 --> 02:23:16.940]  well, will the website come down now?
[02:23:16.940 --> 02:23:18.420]  And got no comment from them.
[02:23:18.420 --> 02:23:23.420]  But on the, if you look at the way that the switch went,
[02:23:23.860 --> 02:23:25.420]  they did it in like 40 countries,
[02:23:25.420 --> 02:23:29.140]  like 40 different stores, and they did it seamlessly.
[02:23:29.140 --> 02:23:32.260]  Like I actually saw somebody was even browsing the site
[02:23:32.260 --> 02:23:34.060]  and it changed on them as they clicked
[02:23:34.060 --> 02:23:35.680]  from one section to another.
[02:23:35.680 --> 02:23:38.580]  So whether that translates forward
[02:23:38.580 --> 02:23:40.420]  into them being able to do whatever they want
[02:23:40.420 --> 02:23:43.080]  without having to take everything down, I don't know.
[02:23:43.080 --> 02:23:45.060]  But it's an interesting indicator, you know,
[02:23:45.060 --> 02:23:48.340]  a leading indicator of maybe the way it works differently
[02:23:48.340 --> 02:23:50.280]  now than it did before and one of the reasons
[02:23:50.280 --> 02:23:52.780]  that they did all that engineering, you know,
[02:23:52.780 --> 02:23:53.740]  behind the scenes.
[02:23:53.740 --> 02:23:55.360]  I mean, I'd be really surprised
[02:23:55.360 --> 02:23:57.260]  if it's still random web objects, although it may.
[02:23:57.260 --> 02:23:59.760]  I don't think so, and it seems based on my Twitter,
[02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:01.620]  you know, it's hard to tell from the outside,
[02:24:01.620 --> 02:24:03.580]  but it's clearly not web objects
[02:24:03.580 --> 02:24:05.420]  that's directly talking to the browser.
[02:24:05.420 --> 02:24:07.500]  There's some kind of Apache front end now.
[02:24:07.500 --> 02:24:09.460]  And now that could be some kind of load balancer
[02:24:09.460 --> 02:24:11.740]  or something in front of web objects,
[02:24:11.740 --> 02:24:12.740]  but it doesn't seem like it.
[02:24:12.740 --> 02:24:15.420]  And I said that it felt faster, but I don't know,
[02:24:15.420 --> 02:24:17.020]  maybe it's that, you know, what did I call it?
[02:24:17.020 --> 02:24:18.640]  The new and shiny placebo effect,
[02:24:18.640 --> 02:24:20.700]  but a bunch of other people on Twitter said,
[02:24:20.700 --> 02:24:23.300]  no, it's not just you, it's definitely faster.
[02:24:23.300 --> 02:24:28.060]  So that makes me think it's not web objects anymore.
[02:24:28.060 --> 02:24:30.180]  And if it is web objects, it's well hidden
[02:24:30.180 --> 02:24:34.240]  behind a faster, much better looking.
[02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:35.080]  Yeah.
[02:24:36.500 --> 02:24:37.980]  Well, anyway, that's the news of the week.
[02:24:37.980 --> 02:24:39.980]  Anything else that you wanted to talk about?
[02:24:41.140 --> 02:24:42.800]  Have I lost you?
[02:24:42.800 --> 02:24:44.140]  I've probably lost you.
[02:24:44.140 --> 02:24:46.780]  Okay, clear again.
[02:24:46.780 --> 02:24:48.500]  Skype is the worst.
[02:24:48.500 --> 02:24:49.340]  You know what's funny?
[02:24:49.340 --> 02:24:51.500]  And it's like, I got, you know, I don't pay for it.
[02:24:51.500 --> 02:24:53.100]  I guess maybe if I could, they'd go away,
[02:24:53.100 --> 02:24:54.700]  but you launch Skype now,
[02:24:54.700 --> 02:24:56.740]  and it gives you like a list of things you can do.
[02:24:56.740 --> 02:24:59.140]  And my list of suggested things to do
[02:24:59.140 --> 02:25:01.460]  was one, upgrade to Windows 10,
[02:25:01.460 --> 02:25:03.820]  and two, take a depression test.
[02:25:03.820 --> 02:25:07.840]  That is, that's literally what it says
[02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:10.020]  in the main Skype window when I launched Skype.
[02:25:10.020 --> 02:25:12.620]  One, things to do today.
[02:25:12.620 --> 02:25:13.980]  That's fantastic.
[02:25:13.980 --> 02:25:16.420]  And I can't help but think that they're related.
[02:25:16.420 --> 02:25:18.940]  Right, exactly, must be related.
[02:25:19.980 --> 02:25:22.100]  That or using Skype is related to depression.
[02:25:22.100 --> 02:25:23.380]  I know that.
[02:25:23.380 --> 02:25:26.900]  Anyway, anyway, you've been extraordinarily gracious
[02:25:26.900 --> 02:25:29.260]  with your time, and that was a great conversation.
[02:25:29.260 --> 02:25:32.240]  Matthew Panzerino, people can read your work
[02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:34.860]  at techcrunch.com, where you are,
[02:25:34.860 --> 02:25:37.660]  your title is, are you editor-in-chief?
[02:25:37.660 --> 02:25:39.560]  Are you, what's your title?
[02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:40.620]  Yeah, editor-in-chief.
[02:25:40.620 --> 02:25:42.460]  Which is well-deserved,
[02:25:42.460 --> 02:25:45.220]  and you're doing a very good job there.
[02:25:45.220 --> 02:25:49.420]  So, and on Twitter, they can see your very fine tweets
[02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:54.300]  at at panzer, P-A-N-Z-E-R.
[02:25:54.300 --> 02:25:56.300]  I'll tell you, when I was trying to look you up on Skype,
[02:25:56.300 --> 02:25:58.440]  I typed in panzer, and it didn't work,
[02:25:58.440 --> 02:25:59.980]  and I was very upset.
[02:25:59.980 --> 02:26:02.300]  Yeah, when I introduce, I get introduced to people,
[02:26:02.300 --> 02:26:03.900]  people introduce me as Panzer now,
[02:26:03.900 --> 02:26:05.500]  which is, I just let it ride.
[02:26:05.500 --> 02:26:07.820]  Yeah, well, it's a good name to own.
[02:26:07.820 --> 02:26:08.660]  It sounds cool.
[02:26:10.140 --> 02:26:11.740]  Anyway, I thank you for your time,
[02:26:11.740 --> 02:26:13.380]  and talk to you soon.
[02:26:13.380 --> 02:26:18.380]  Thank you, sir, have a good one.
