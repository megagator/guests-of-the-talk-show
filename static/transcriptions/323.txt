[00:00.000 --> 00:01.960]  Let me ask you this, I mean, here's a good place to start.
[00:01.960 --> 00:05.700]  Have you ordered an iPhone 13 for yourself yet?
[00:05.700 --> 00:07.020]  I have not.
[00:07.020 --> 00:10.060]  And the only reason I haven't ordered one for myself
[00:10.060 --> 00:14.180]  is because I, and this is the normal conundrum,
[00:14.180 --> 00:17.300]  unless I'm on it, iPhone review season
[00:17.300 --> 00:20.260]  comes right in the middle of like my busy season
[00:20.260 --> 00:21.100]  here at TechCrunch.
[00:21.100 --> 00:22.260]  We do a big event.
[00:23.620 --> 00:25.340]  We have, you know, a big conference.
[00:25.340 --> 00:26.500]  Normally I'm traveling.
[00:26.500 --> 00:27.800]  This year, obviously we weren't traveling.
[00:27.800 --> 00:29.040]  We did most of it virtual,
[00:29.040 --> 00:32.040]  but it's just a big undertaking, a big effort.
[00:32.040 --> 00:34.680]  And then usually, and you know,
[00:34.680 --> 00:37.600]  Apple people are normally very apologetic about this,
[00:37.600 --> 00:38.920]  but it is what it is.
[00:38.920 --> 00:41.360]  The iPhone release comes smack on top of it.
[00:41.360 --> 00:43.920]  I've been doing this for eight years and like the,
[00:43.920 --> 00:45.880]  I think all but the, or nine years,
[00:45.880 --> 00:48.240]  all but the like two or three years ago,
[00:48.240 --> 00:51.120]  something the iPhone release basically landed
[00:51.120 --> 00:52.680]  on Disrupt Week for me.
[00:52.680 --> 00:54.160]  So it drives me insane.
[00:54.160 --> 00:55.800]  You know, I've got to like do my review.
[00:55.800 --> 00:58.000]  I always, you know, I want to do a good job
[00:58.000 --> 00:59.640]  and I want to be thorough, but at the same time,
[00:59.640 --> 01:01.760]  I've got a lot of event stuff and planning going on.
[01:01.760 --> 01:03.360]  It's just a very hectic time for me.
[01:03.360 --> 01:05.480]  And so normally what happens is I get through
[01:05.480 --> 01:06.320]  with my review.
[01:06.320 --> 01:07.240]  I go right into Disrupt.
[01:07.240 --> 01:09.700]  I've got, you know, whatever crises I'm managing
[01:09.700 --> 01:12.140]  and interviews and you know, our whole show.
[01:12.140 --> 01:13.200]  And then by the end of that,
[01:13.200 --> 01:16.280]  I'm exhausted and I just chill for a couple of weeks.
[01:16.280 --> 01:19.320]  And then I'm like, oh, I got to order an iPhone.
[01:19.320 --> 01:23.660]  And so like what normally happens is I end up
[01:23.660 --> 01:27.340]  about three to four weeks behind everybody,
[01:27.340 --> 01:30.960]  which means that this year, because it was virtual,
[01:30.960 --> 01:32.920]  we finished the show and then the next day,
[01:32.920 --> 01:35.440]  I don't have to travel and I can't order an iPhone
[01:35.440 --> 01:37.780]  because my upgrade's not up yet.
[01:37.780 --> 01:39.280]  So I got to wait until that's okay.
[01:39.280 --> 01:40.120]  So it's like four weeks later.
[01:40.120 --> 01:41.400]  Right, you're stuck on the schedule
[01:41.400 --> 01:42.880]  from when you ordered before.
[01:42.880 --> 01:44.480]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:44.480 --> 01:46.440]  So yeah, that's why I haven't ordered yet,
[01:46.440 --> 01:49.860]  but I probably will order and I'm going to get a 13 Pro,
[01:49.860 --> 01:50.700]  just a regular.
[01:50.700 --> 01:51.520]  That's what I ordered.
[01:51.520 --> 01:56.500]  But mine's not here yet because I've lost my mojo
[01:56.500 --> 01:59.440]  for ordering as orders open.
[01:59.440 --> 02:02.080]  I think it was 6 a.m. Eastern time.
[02:02.080 --> 02:04.360]  I forget, maybe it was 9 a.m. Eastern
[02:04.360 --> 02:06.100]  and 6 a.m. Pacific this year.
[02:06.100 --> 02:08.320]  It's varied over the years.
[02:08.320 --> 02:10.880]  I remember for a while, there was a series,
[02:10.880 --> 02:15.440]  it coincided with when Andy Baio and friends
[02:15.440 --> 02:19.360]  were running the XOXO Conference in Portland,
[02:19.360 --> 02:22.880]  which for a few years coincided,
[02:22.880 --> 02:25.240]  it was like a Friday, Saturday, Sunday conference
[02:25.240 --> 02:28.960]  in Portland, Oregon, the three days after
[02:28.960 --> 02:31.600]  a Tuesday Apple event in California.
[02:31.600 --> 02:34.080]  And it was a great conference.
[02:35.440 --> 02:38.840]  But I was already in California for that,
[02:38.840 --> 02:42.320]  so it made no sense to fly to California from Philadelphia,
[02:42.320 --> 02:45.140]  fly home and then fly back to Portland.
[02:45.140 --> 02:47.440]  So I would just stay on the West Coast
[02:47.440 --> 02:49.080]  and my wife would usually come,
[02:49.080 --> 02:50.720]  I think she went every year to XOXO
[02:50.720 --> 02:52.440]  and she would just fly solo separately
[02:52.440 --> 02:54.260]  and we'd meet up in Portland,
[02:54.260 --> 02:56.280]  which seemed very exotic.
[02:56.280 --> 02:58.720]  We just don't live a life where,
[02:58.720 --> 03:00.920]  usually it's either me traveling solo
[03:00.920 --> 03:03.600]  or us traveling together and we just never meet
[03:03.600 --> 03:07.320]  in an exotic locale like beautiful Portland, Oregon.
[03:07.320 --> 03:09.500]  I actually, and I say that, but I actually,
[03:09.500 --> 03:10.500]  I like Portland a lot.
[03:10.500 --> 03:11.760]  It's a very fun city.
[03:11.760 --> 03:14.480]  But then in those years, all of the years
[03:14.480 --> 03:16.320]  that I remember from XOXO,
[03:16.320 --> 03:20.740]  it was a 3 a.m. Eastern, midnight Pacific opening window.
[03:20.740 --> 03:23.320]  And so midnight wasn't bad on the Pacific
[03:23.320 --> 03:25.680]  and it would be like, but we'd be like at a bar
[03:25.680 --> 03:26.880]  or something like that.
[03:26.880 --> 03:30.520]  There was a rooftop lounge the one time on top of a hotel
[03:30.520 --> 03:31.560]  and it's all these people,
[03:31.560 --> 03:34.600]  everybody at once at like 11.58,
[03:34.600 --> 03:38.400]  everybody in the entire establishment takes out their phone
[03:38.400 --> 03:40.840]  and is like hitting reload on the Apple store
[03:40.840 --> 03:42.960]  trying to buy iPhones at the same time.
[03:42.960 --> 03:47.060]  Even though I wasn't with the iPhone media crowd,
[03:47.060 --> 03:51.440]  it's now XOXO, but it's like just as much, if not more so.
[03:51.440 --> 03:53.480]  Overlap there, yeah.
[03:53.480 --> 03:56.360]  But now I'm off it, you know, I've gotten lazy
[03:56.360 --> 03:59.080]  and I did order on day one, but by the time I ordered,
[03:59.080 --> 04:02.480]  I was already, it was already four to six weeks backlogged
[04:02.480 --> 04:03.400]  or something like that.
[04:03.400 --> 04:04.580]  But anyway, I got the same thing.
[04:04.580 --> 04:09.580]  The regular size iPhone 13 Pro after one year
[04:10.560 --> 04:12.400]  with the non-Pro iPhone 12,
[04:12.400 --> 04:15.200]  which I loved in every single regard.
[04:15.200 --> 04:17.080]  Your mini or?
[04:17.080 --> 04:18.080]  No, I did not buy it.
[04:18.080 --> 04:19.120]  No, no, no, you got the Pro.
[04:19.120 --> 04:19.960]  Okay, gotcha.
[04:19.960 --> 04:24.960]  So for the last year, I had the regular iPhone 12, not Pro.
[04:25.040 --> 04:26.240]  Right, right.
[04:26.240 --> 04:27.600]  And yeah, I remember we talked about this
[04:27.600 --> 04:28.540]  because of the telephoto, right?
[04:28.540 --> 04:30.880]  You weren't convinced that the telephoto was enough for you.
[04:30.880 --> 04:33.400]  Well, it wasn't, yeah, yeah.
[04:33.400 --> 04:36.640]  And especially knowing when I ordered it a year ago,
[04:36.640 --> 04:37.480]  like it was, well, no,
[04:37.480 --> 04:39.400]  I guess it was more like October last year, right?
[04:39.400 --> 04:40.640]  Because they were late.
[04:40.640 --> 04:45.100]  But still, even at that time, mid pandemic,
[04:45.100 --> 04:46.920]  knowing that we were going, you know,
[04:46.920 --> 04:49.560]  it was like as certain as anything in the pandemic
[04:49.560 --> 04:51.360]  has ever been and with all the uncertainty
[04:51.360 --> 04:54.120]  that winter was going to be bad,
[04:54.120 --> 04:57.400]  that well, if ever there's going to be a year
[04:57.400 --> 04:59.880]  where I'm going to take fewer photos than ever
[04:59.880 --> 05:02.280]  and that the photos I take
[05:02.280 --> 05:04.300]  are not going to be shot at a distance,
[05:04.300 --> 05:05.600]  it's probably gonna be the next year.
[05:05.600 --> 05:06.520]  And I was kind of right.
[05:06.520 --> 05:08.960]  I mean, we wound up taking a few vacations this summer
[05:08.960 --> 05:10.380]  and there were definitely some times
[05:10.380 --> 05:11.960]  where I wished I had the telephoto lens,
[05:11.960 --> 05:15.000]  but anyway, I got the Pro.
[05:15.000 --> 05:16.560]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:16.560 --> 05:18.660]  Yeah, I was just curious actually
[05:18.660 --> 05:19.500]  when we were talking about it.
[05:19.500 --> 05:22.400]  So I checked my upgrade and I'm actually not eligible
[05:22.400 --> 05:25.280]  for an upgrade until like January, I think.
[05:25.280 --> 05:27.960]  So it must've been a quite a delay last year
[05:27.960 --> 05:28.920]  for me upgrading.
[05:28.920 --> 05:30.140]  I must've been running my own phone
[05:30.140 --> 05:31.720]  for quite a while after that.
[05:31.720 --> 05:33.620]  It's gonna be a while for me, but I'm not stressed.
[05:33.620 --> 05:36.080]  I mean, you can, the iPhone upgrade program,
[05:36.080 --> 05:38.720]  I believe you can pay early, you know,
[05:38.720 --> 05:39.920]  like pay to upgrade early,
[05:39.920 --> 05:42.000]  basically pay the balance on your contract.
[05:42.000 --> 05:43.680]  And it's usually like 100, 200 bucks
[05:43.680 --> 05:46.920]  if you're a month or two out, but I'm not that stressed.
[05:46.920 --> 05:50.520]  I'll just keep running my 12 and, you know,
[05:50.520 --> 05:53.520]  it's not that big of a deal, but I need that telephoto.
[05:54.640 --> 05:56.400]  Well, we've, and we've talked about this before.
[05:56.400 --> 05:57.400]  I think with you on the show,
[05:57.400 --> 05:59.240]  and I know you've written about it extensively
[05:59.240 --> 06:00.320]  in your reviews on TechCrunch.
[06:00.320 --> 06:02.680]  You love the telephoto lens and you,
[06:02.680 --> 06:04.200]  I know from your photos, you're just,
[06:04.200 --> 06:05.220]  you're really good at it.
[06:05.220 --> 06:10.020]  You just, your photographer's eye lends itself
[06:10.020 --> 06:15.020]  to those 50 to 80 ish millimeter equivalent focal distances.
[06:15.020 --> 06:19.600]  I'm more of a fixed wide angle lens person.
[06:19.600 --> 06:23.360]  Like I've owned a lot of standalone fixed lens cameras
[06:23.360 --> 06:24.200]  over the years.
[06:24.200 --> 06:29.200]  My Fuji X 100 S I think is a 35 millimeter equivalent
[06:30.040 --> 06:31.960]  or so, either that or 28.
[06:31.960 --> 06:36.960]  And my beloved Ricoh GRD from like 2007 or six or so,
[06:38.160 --> 06:40.560]  which is probably the best camera I ever owned,
[06:40.560 --> 06:42.800]  pound for pound, photo for photo,
[06:42.800 --> 06:46.920]  photo for photo was a 28 millimeter fixed lens,
[06:46.920 --> 06:48.480]  you know, no zoom at all.
[06:49.720 --> 06:52.840]  That's my natural eye, but I love having it.
[06:52.840 --> 06:55.640]  I still love having the extra distance.
[06:55.640 --> 06:56.480]  Anyway, we can talk about the camera.
[06:56.480 --> 06:59.360]  Yeah, it's the framing and cropping thing.
[06:59.360 --> 07:01.520]  Yeah, the other thing, before I take the first break,
[07:01.520 --> 07:04.880]  I did one thing I wanted to mention in you saying,
[07:05.760 --> 07:07.440]  you know, that you're on the upgrade program.
[07:07.440 --> 07:10.200]  I wrote last week before the phones got
[07:10.200 --> 07:12.420]  in the customer's hands, probably a day too late.
[07:12.420 --> 07:14.320]  I wish I'd thought about it the day before,
[07:14.320 --> 07:19.320]  but to recommend to people the device to device transfer,
[07:20.880 --> 07:23.560]  where you just boot up your new phone and it's like,
[07:23.560 --> 07:24.400]  what do you want to do?
[07:24.400 --> 07:25.640]  And Apple calls it quick start.
[07:25.640 --> 07:26.920]  You want to just do the quick start,
[07:26.920 --> 07:29.520]  bring one of your own devices nearby.
[07:29.520 --> 07:31.960]  And if you want to, you can just bring it nearby
[07:31.960 --> 07:35.140]  and it takes the like wifi password from it.
[07:35.140 --> 07:37.660]  You just log in with your iTunes account,
[07:37.660 --> 07:40.280]  which even just getting the wifi password
[07:40.280 --> 07:43.680]  is a huge help, right?
[07:43.680 --> 07:48.000]  Because typing in a even moderately complex wifi password
[07:48.000 --> 07:51.560]  is way harder than just pointing your one camera
[07:51.560 --> 07:54.160]  at the blue, I don't know what you call that thing,
[07:54.160 --> 07:55.920]  the blue cloud.
[07:55.920 --> 07:58.280]  Yeah, it's a fancy QR code, but yes,
[07:58.280 --> 07:59.840]  they're point cloud, right?
[07:59.840 --> 08:02.360]  But it amuses me to no end,
[08:02.360 --> 08:05.080]  but also doesn't surprise me at all
[08:05.080 --> 08:07.580]  that Apple goes so far out of its way
[08:07.580 --> 08:11.180]  to avoid actual QR codes and makes these beautiful things.
[08:11.180 --> 08:14.080]  They do the same thing when you associate an Apple watch
[08:14.080 --> 08:15.040]  with an iPhone.
[08:15.040 --> 08:16.720]  But then if you just continue at that point,
[08:16.720 --> 08:18.640]  they give you the option, if you'd like to,
[08:18.640 --> 08:22.760]  we could just upgrade from your iCloud backup,
[08:22.760 --> 08:24.840]  or we could just transfer device to device.
[08:24.840 --> 08:27.000]  And I wrote a piece about the weird nature
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.080]  of being an Apple device reviewer,
[08:30.080 --> 08:34.440]  especially now in the era of like four new iPhones a year,
[08:34.440 --> 08:39.440]  sometimes five, if there's an iPhone SE model, plus iPads.
[08:39.440 --> 08:43.320]  It's like I set, and then I buy an iPhone for myself
[08:43.320 --> 08:48.280]  and I end up setting up a lot of iOS devices a year
[08:48.280 --> 08:50.040]  for somebody who's not running
[08:50.040 --> 08:53.040]  like a consumer report style lab, you know?
[08:53.040 --> 08:54.440]  Sure, right, right.
[08:54.440 --> 08:57.160]  Or not a developer where you're used to having
[08:57.160 --> 08:59.160]  a bed of test devices.
[08:59.160 --> 09:01.720]  I, years ago, gave up on the,
[09:01.720 --> 09:04.640]  it used to be that you could do it from iCloud
[09:04.640 --> 09:07.360]  or do it from like an iTunes.
[09:07.360 --> 09:09.520]  Now iTunes is gone and you do it in a finder,
[09:09.520 --> 09:13.000]  but I'll call it an iTunes backup on your Mac,
[09:13.000 --> 09:18.000]  which if you encrypt it and put a password on your backup,
[09:18.040 --> 09:20.040]  which you can't forget, it's encrypted,
[09:20.040 --> 09:20.880]  it's like good encryption.
[09:20.880 --> 09:22.400]  And which you can only do
[09:22.400 --> 09:24.280]  if you back it up to your Mac, obviously,
[09:24.280 --> 09:25.680]  or to your computer.
[09:25.680 --> 09:29.400]  The computer backup without encryption
[09:29.400 --> 09:30.840]  doesn't have any of your passwords
[09:30.840 --> 09:33.160]  for the obvious reason that it's not encrypted.
[09:33.160 --> 09:34.240]  If you do encrypt it,
[09:34.240 --> 09:36.120]  they store all sorts of more sensitive stuff
[09:36.120 --> 09:37.880]  like your passwords and your login state,
[09:37.880 --> 09:40.440]  and you get more.
[09:40.440 --> 09:41.720]  And that's why iCloud,
[09:41.720 --> 09:46.000]  because iCloud backups are not end-to-end encrypted yet,
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.320]  maybe, who knows, that's a whole separate discussion
[09:48.320 --> 09:49.160]  we don't have time for.
[09:49.160 --> 09:51.960]  But since the current state of iCloud backup
[09:51.960 --> 09:53.920]  is that they're not end-to-end encrypted,
[09:53.920 --> 09:58.640]  they don't include anything that's sensitive like passwords.
[09:58.640 --> 10:00.840]  So if you do the device backup to your Mac,
[10:00.840 --> 10:02.240]  you get more stuff.
[10:02.240 --> 10:05.440]  But it's a huge rigmarole to me
[10:05.440 --> 10:07.000]  compared to the device device.
[10:07.000 --> 10:08.080]  It might be faster,
[10:08.080 --> 10:11.920]  but now you've got like tens of gigabytes of space
[10:11.920 --> 10:14.400]  on your Mac taken up by these backups.
[10:14.400 --> 10:16.240]  Oh yeah, they eat up so quick,
[10:16.240 --> 10:17.800]  especially with photos and all that.
[10:17.800 --> 10:19.640]  Yeah, they eat up quick,
[10:19.640 --> 10:21.640]  and you have to remember to do it.
[10:21.640 --> 10:23.160]  And if you haven't backed up first,
[10:23.160 --> 10:24.640]  first you have to take a plug
[10:24.640 --> 10:27.120]  and plug it in your old iPhone and do a fresh backup
[10:27.120 --> 10:28.240]  so it's a fresh backup.
[10:28.240 --> 10:29.800]  Then take it and plug it in the other thing
[10:29.800 --> 10:30.640]  and do a restore.
[10:30.640 --> 10:32.920]  And I'm sure lots of people listening still do it.
[10:32.920 --> 10:34.040]  There's a lot of people who just,
[10:34.040 --> 10:35.560]  once they have a system that works,
[10:35.560 --> 10:36.960]  they don't wanna take a chance,
[10:36.960 --> 10:38.760]  even if they know it's just,
[10:38.760 --> 10:42.040]  well, I could waste three hours trying it
[10:42.040 --> 10:43.480]  the way Gruber says I should,
[10:43.480 --> 10:45.040]  but I don't even feel like doing that.
[10:45.040 --> 10:46.520]  I'll just do it the way I know.
[10:46.520 --> 10:49.040]  And for some people, the encrypted backup really matters.
[10:49.040 --> 10:49.880]  Right. Right?
[10:49.880 --> 10:52.600]  Like for security consciousness and protection,
[10:52.600 --> 10:53.440]  that kind of thing. Right.
[10:53.440 --> 10:54.280]  But you don't have to do,
[10:54.280 --> 10:55.800]  the thing about the device-to-device
[10:55.800 --> 10:57.600]  is you don't have to do a backup at all.
[10:57.600 --> 10:59.680]  You just bring your old phone next to your new phone
[10:59.680 --> 11:01.400]  and leave them together.
[11:01.400 --> 11:03.960]  And for some varying amount of time,
[11:03.960 --> 11:06.840]  for me, it seemed to take about 90 minutes each time.
[11:06.840 --> 11:08.040]  I know some people,
[11:08.040 --> 11:10.200]  Ben Thompson says it took eight hours
[11:10.200 --> 11:12.480]  and still failed for him overnight.
[11:12.480 --> 11:14.880]  I guess it depends how much stuff you have on your phone.
[11:14.880 --> 11:18.040]  But because it's device-to-device,
[11:18.040 --> 11:19.360]  you don't have to do a backup first.
[11:19.360 --> 11:20.680]  You don't have to do anything first.
[11:20.680 --> 11:23.880]  And Apple somehow makes a super secure connection
[11:23.880 --> 11:25.340]  from one iPhone to the other.
[11:25.340 --> 11:27.960]  You've already authenticated with your iCloud account.
[11:27.960 --> 11:30.800]  And so it transfers everything.
[11:30.800 --> 11:33.440]  Or everything that can be done.
[11:33.440 --> 11:36.780]  There are some apps that can flag something as,
[11:36.780 --> 11:38.880]  no matter what, don't back this up.
[11:38.880 --> 11:41.480]  And that doesn't get transferred over.
[11:41.480 --> 11:44.120]  So like people who use the Google Authenticator app,
[11:44.120 --> 11:46.320]  you have to like do a lot of work
[11:46.320 --> 11:49.400]  to move it to a new machine each time.
[11:49.400 --> 11:50.940]  But anyway, what I was thinking was that
[11:50.940 --> 11:52.920]  the biggest downside I can think of,
[11:52.920 --> 11:55.000]  and that I heard after I wrote about this
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.760]  was from people in the iPhone upgrade program
[11:57.760 --> 12:00.200]  who do it by going to the retail store.
[12:00.200 --> 12:02.680]  Because you come in, you come in,
[12:02.680 --> 12:04.440]  you wait and they're like, okay, you're up.
[12:04.440 --> 12:06.900]  And you go to the counter and you give them your order.
[12:06.900 --> 12:08.400]  And they're like, oh, here's your new iPhone.
[12:08.400 --> 12:10.680]  And then you hand your old iPhone over
[12:10.680 --> 12:12.960]  and you expect it to get the hell out.
[12:12.960 --> 12:16.040]  So you don't have time to do it.
[12:16.040 --> 12:18.840]  And I suspect if you do it like mid-year,
[12:18.840 --> 12:19.900]  if you wait a couple months
[12:19.900 --> 12:21.800]  until there's not like this big rush,
[12:21.800 --> 12:24.440]  I think that they might let you sit at the Genius Counter
[12:24.440 --> 12:26.800]  for an hour or whatever and do it.
[12:26.800 --> 12:28.960]  But I think at the moment with COVID restrictions
[12:28.960 --> 12:31.280]  and with the seasonal rush of everybody
[12:31.280 --> 12:33.180]  getting a new iPhone, you can't do it.
[12:34.200 --> 12:36.680]  Right, and you know that,
[12:36.680 --> 12:39.600]  I believe that if you do the iPhone upgrade at home,
[12:39.600 --> 12:40.440]  I'm almost possible.
[12:40.440 --> 12:42.440]  Yeah, they send you the new one
[12:42.440 --> 12:45.280]  and you have the new one and your old one, obviously.
[12:45.280 --> 12:47.080]  That wouldn't make any sense to send your old one first.
[12:47.080 --> 12:49.360]  But yeah, you have the both in your possession
[12:49.360 --> 12:50.900]  and you can do that at your leisure.
[12:50.900 --> 12:51.740]  But that makes sense.
[12:51.740 --> 12:53.760]  I didn't even think about the in-store situation
[12:53.760 --> 12:56.360]  not being friendly to that device-to-device transfer.
[12:56.360 --> 12:59.160]  Yeah, and I got a lot of feedback from it.
[12:59.160 --> 13:00.120]  And I was a little wary.
[13:00.120 --> 13:01.840]  I was like, I'm gonna tell everybody to do this
[13:01.840 --> 13:03.520]  because I've been doing this for so many devices
[13:03.520 --> 13:04.740]  for so many years.
[13:04.740 --> 13:07.300]  And what happened was a couple of years ago,
[13:08.800 --> 13:11.680]  it was, I was staying, I think I actually took,
[13:11.680 --> 13:14.960]  it was that year that I took the ride back to the city
[13:14.960 --> 13:16.960]  with you after the event.
[13:16.960 --> 13:19.360]  And you were kind enough to give me a ride
[13:19.360 --> 13:21.280]  and I was staying in San Francisco
[13:21.280 --> 13:23.140]  and I hadn't set up my new iPhones yet,
[13:23.140 --> 13:25.440]  but I had gotten them from Apple,
[13:25.440 --> 13:28.080]  my review units after the event.
[13:28.080 --> 13:29.600]  It's like five in the afternoon.
[13:29.600 --> 13:32.040]  I had dinner plans with friends who live in San Francisco.
[13:32.040 --> 13:34.720]  I was like, well, I need to quick set up this new iPhone.
[13:34.720 --> 13:37.260]  And it was like, I didn't have my Mac handy,
[13:37.260 --> 13:38.100]  didn't have that.
[13:38.100 --> 13:39.160]  I was like, ah, what a pain.
[13:39.160 --> 13:41.720]  I wish I could just like put these right next to each other.
[13:41.720 --> 13:44.520]  And now you can.
[13:44.520 --> 13:46.040]  And anyway, I recommended it.
[13:46.040 --> 13:49.300]  Readers who did it overwhelmingly were like,
[13:49.300 --> 13:50.240]  hey, this is amazing.
[13:50.240 --> 13:51.780]  I didn't know this worked so well.
[13:51.780 --> 13:54.840]  Or I tried this three years ago and it didn't work that well.
[13:54.840 --> 13:57.000]  Now it works so much better.
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.440]  That was really my situation too because I tried it
[13:59.440 --> 14:01.040]  the first year it was out.
[14:01.040 --> 14:04.600]  And like you, I always have to do six of them
[14:04.600 --> 14:08.320]  at once or four at once or definitely a bunch more
[14:08.320 --> 14:09.960]  than a normal person would.
[14:09.960 --> 14:12.000]  And I experienced so many issues with it
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.800]  the first year it was out.
[14:13.800 --> 14:16.880]  It took an enormous amount of time, like five to six hours.
[14:16.880 --> 14:19.360]  It still didn't complete properly, et cetera.
[14:19.360 --> 14:22.120]  And it really turned me off of that option for a while.
[14:22.120 --> 14:26.840]  So ever since then, I have been using the iCloud option,
[14:26.840 --> 14:29.080]  which does require, of course, that you log back
[14:29.080 --> 14:31.800]  into all of your junk because it does not copy
[14:31.800 --> 14:32.620]  over the password.
[14:32.620 --> 14:33.520]  It's not encrypted.
[14:33.520 --> 14:37.840]  So you lose a lot of convenience and you have to go
[14:37.840 --> 14:40.800]  through a whole round of re-logging for a month
[14:40.800 --> 14:42.920]  where you open new apps and you're, oh, great,
[14:42.920 --> 14:44.640]  I haven't logged into this thing yet.
[14:44.640 --> 14:45.960]  And you have to do that.
[14:45.960 --> 14:47.900]  So I'm gonna give it a try next time.
[14:47.900 --> 14:52.020]  I guess when I get mine, when I actually run my personal,
[14:52.020 --> 14:53.760]  I'm gonna give it a go.
[14:53.760 --> 14:55.440]  Based off of your experience with it,
[14:55.440 --> 14:57.360]  it seems like maybe they've improved it quite a bit
[14:57.360 --> 15:00.380]  or maybe it was just a bad experience
[15:00.380 --> 15:02.280]  because I had so many devices to do at once
[15:02.280 --> 15:04.040]  and there's a time crunch and all that.
[15:04.040 --> 15:07.160]  I am under the impression that they have a,
[15:07.160 --> 15:10.320]  I don't know how big the team is, probably a small team
[15:10.320 --> 15:13.360]  because small teams are generally more effective.
[15:13.360 --> 15:15.380]  But there's like a small team of people at Apple
[15:15.380 --> 15:17.020]  who work on this stuff.
[15:17.020 --> 15:20.000]  And to me, their work is unheralded,
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.140]  because people, you know what I mean?
[15:21.140 --> 15:22.600]  You do it once, you forget about it.
[15:22.600 --> 15:25.060]  And the only time most people ever really think
[15:25.060 --> 15:28.960]  about the migration is if it fails in some way, right?
[15:28.960 --> 15:32.600]  Like if it just works and you pick off where you left off
[15:32.600 --> 15:34.400]  and all of your stuff is just there
[15:34.400 --> 15:36.720]  and you're logged into almost all of your apps
[15:36.720 --> 15:38.800]  and it's like, you think like, oh, that's cool.
[15:38.800 --> 15:41.320]  And then you'd never think about it again.
[15:41.320 --> 15:46.080]  It's unheralded work, but I think that they've been doing
[15:46.080 --> 15:49.120]  extremely good work year over year,
[15:49.120 --> 15:51.120]  making it better and better, more efficient,
[15:51.120 --> 15:52.160]  et cetera, et cetera.
[15:53.680 --> 15:55.320]  Let me take a break here, thank our first sponsor.
[15:55.320 --> 15:58.160]  Look, you listening, you're a busy guy, probably,
[15:58.160 --> 16:01.000]  possibly if you are a guy, but I'll bet you're busy.
[16:01.000 --> 16:03.920]  But you can stop thinking about what to wear
[16:03.920 --> 16:06.600]  and just embrace the radically efficient
[16:06.600 --> 16:09.280]  Mack Weldon daily wear system.
[16:09.280 --> 16:12.480]  The daily wear system is a selection of clothes rooted
[16:12.480 --> 16:15.320]  in smart design made with performance fabrics
[16:15.320 --> 16:17.080]  built to work together.
[16:17.080 --> 16:19.120]  From breathable t-shirts and polos
[16:19.120 --> 16:23.280]  to stylish button-ups and shorts, underwear and beyond,
[16:23.280 --> 16:27.360]  Mack Weldon makes it easy for you to dress for work,
[16:27.360 --> 16:32.360]  leisure and play or wherever your fall takes you.
[16:33.700 --> 16:37.920]  My favorite Mack Weldon products is, I love the t-shirts.
[16:37.920 --> 16:39.280]  I have all the underwear.
[16:39.280 --> 16:41.840]  You can, you know, underwear,
[16:41.840 --> 16:43.960]  you don't really think about it, but man, the t-shirts,
[16:43.960 --> 16:45.720]  the polos, I love them.
[16:46.720 --> 16:49.400]  My biggest concern with the Mack Weldon stuff
[16:49.400 --> 16:50.840]  as they continue to sponsor the show
[16:50.840 --> 16:52.320]  is that when this pandemic's over
[16:52.320 --> 16:53.920]  and people started like getting back together
[16:53.920 --> 16:56.200]  and there's like a WWDC that like,
[16:56.200 --> 16:58.880]  everybody's gonna be wearing the same shirts
[16:58.880 --> 17:01.160]  because it's, they're that good.
[17:01.160 --> 17:03.360]  Last time I saw my pal Marco Arment,
[17:03.360 --> 17:04.180]  we had the same problem.
[17:04.180 --> 17:05.560]  We were like wearing the same clothes
[17:05.560 --> 17:08.200]  because it's that good.
[17:08.200 --> 17:09.960]  But you know, the good news is Mack Weldon
[17:09.960 --> 17:11.160]  keeps expanding their lineup
[17:11.160 --> 17:12.840]  and they've got more and more stuff,
[17:12.840 --> 17:14.600]  but it really is great stuff.
[17:14.600 --> 17:15.820]  I love it.
[17:15.820 --> 17:17.840]  It really does take the thinking out of it.
[17:17.840 --> 17:20.720]  You just go there and buy stuff and it's just great.
[17:20.720 --> 17:23.960]  And they last and last and last and last.
[17:23.960 --> 17:25.960]  It's really, really well-made stuff.
[17:25.960 --> 17:30.000]  You can get started in their daily wear system
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.720]  and get 20% off your first order
[17:32.720 --> 17:34.160]  by visiting Mack Weldon,
[17:34.160 --> 17:37.600]  M-A-C-K-W-E-L-D-O-N,
[17:37.600 --> 17:41.160]  mackweldon.com slash talk show
[17:41.160 --> 17:44.120]  and just use that same promo code talk show.
[17:44.120 --> 17:47.380]  When you check out, you get 20% off your first order.
[17:47.380 --> 17:51.200]  That's mackweldon.com slash talk show.
[17:51.200 --> 17:54.640]  Go to Mack Weldon, radically efficient wardrobing.
[17:55.980 --> 17:59.120]  What's your, now that we're like a week past
[17:59.120 --> 18:00.660]  dropping the reviews,
[18:00.660 --> 18:03.200]  what is your one week past review
[18:03.200 --> 18:05.920]  thinking of the state of the iPhones 13?
[18:07.160 --> 18:07.980]  Pretty good.
[18:07.980 --> 18:11.040]  I mean, really solid offerings across the board.
[18:11.040 --> 18:15.760]  I don't think there's a huge weak spot in this lineup.
[18:15.760 --> 18:18.360]  The unification of the camera systems is huge, right?
[18:18.360 --> 18:20.520]  That's a really big step forward.
[18:20.520 --> 18:22.560]  They've had alternating years now
[18:22.560 --> 18:25.720]  of the cameras being roughly comparable
[18:25.720 --> 18:28.240]  between the models in the same lineup
[18:28.240 --> 18:30.080]  and then where they have not been.
[18:30.080 --> 18:32.120]  And by far, of course, I prefer the years
[18:32.120 --> 18:33.200]  where you get to make a choice
[18:33.200 --> 18:35.740]  based on your size and usability
[18:35.740 --> 18:39.120]  and not have to give up camera capability, right?
[18:39.120 --> 18:40.240]  You don't want to do that.
[18:40.240 --> 18:41.080]  That's not ideal.
[18:41.080 --> 18:43.400]  And I'm sure it's not ideal for them as well.
[18:43.400 --> 18:48.400]  And recently that was due to the fact that the OIS module,
[18:48.600 --> 18:51.240]  the internal stabilization module was quite large
[18:51.240 --> 18:53.500]  and unable to fit in some of the models.
[18:53.500 --> 18:55.600]  And that's why the big one had it.
[18:55.600 --> 18:58.280]  And now they've managed to miniaturize that
[18:58.280 --> 19:02.440]  to enough of a degree where the 13 or 13 pro max
[19:02.440 --> 19:05.600]  or 13 pro or pro max,
[19:05.600 --> 19:09.000]  you're just making a call based on size and usability,
[19:09.000 --> 19:10.160]  which is the right thing.
[19:10.160 --> 19:13.160]  Like you want, oh, this feels good to me,
[19:13.160 --> 19:14.440]  so this is the one I'm gonna pick.
[19:14.440 --> 19:17.040]  You don't want, this feels bad to me,
[19:17.040 --> 19:19.000]  but it has the features I want, right?
[19:19.000 --> 19:22.840]  That's a nightmare scenario for any designer.
[19:22.840 --> 19:25.360]  It's like, oh, this feels bad, but I have to use it, right?
[19:25.360 --> 19:26.580]  And like, that sucks.
[19:26.580 --> 19:29.200]  That's not how people who build tools
[19:29.200 --> 19:31.240]  want you to feel about those tools.
[19:31.240 --> 19:34.260]  And I think that's why it's in such a good state for me.
[19:34.260 --> 19:36.640]  Like that's the core of why it feels great right now
[19:36.640 --> 19:40.960]  is that you can make a call based on your desire
[19:40.960 --> 19:45.360]  and usability and even between the 13 and 13 pro.
[19:45.360 --> 19:47.640]  And I, once again, I kind of focus on the cameras
[19:47.640 --> 19:49.520]  cause that's what I think about a lot.
[19:49.520 --> 19:51.280]  But even between those two models,
[19:51.280 --> 19:53.300]  you're making less compromises than ever
[19:53.300 --> 19:57.000]  and really making a call based on a few edge features
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.720]  that may not be mainstream,
[19:59.720 --> 20:02.160]  like 120 Hertz or a few other ones.
[20:02.160 --> 20:05.440]  And you're still getting a really great wide angle camera.
[20:05.440 --> 20:06.900]  So if you're like, you know,
[20:06.900 --> 20:08.600]  someone who uses it as a primary camera,
[20:08.600 --> 20:10.160]  but doesn't really play around with the telephoto
[20:10.160 --> 20:11.440]  or whatever, you know,
[20:11.440 --> 20:14.740]  you do have the option to just genuinely say,
[20:14.740 --> 20:18.080]  I can save money and still get a really great camera
[20:18.080 --> 20:19.600]  versus, oh, I can save money,
[20:19.600 --> 20:22.680]  but I know I'm gonna get a kind of a poorer camera
[20:22.680 --> 20:23.840]  out of this, right?
[20:23.840 --> 20:26.260]  And I think that's a really, really good solid position
[20:26.260 --> 20:27.320]  for Apple to be in.
[20:27.320 --> 20:29.040]  And I think it makes the choice
[20:29.040 --> 20:31.240]  for the consumer really great.
[20:31.240 --> 20:32.880]  And so they're gonna end up with, I think,
[20:32.880 --> 20:36.060]  a big, big sales year for these models
[20:36.060 --> 20:38.560]  because of the lack of compromises necessary.
[20:38.560 --> 20:42.100]  Yeah, I think lack of compromise is a good summary.
[20:42.100 --> 20:44.160]  In the earlier years of iPhone,
[20:44.160 --> 20:46.440]  like the first half of the iPhone era,
[20:46.440 --> 20:51.080]  they were much more on a AB cycle,
[20:51.080 --> 20:53.360]  TikTok cycle, I guess, in the parlance, right?
[20:53.360 --> 20:57.440]  And, you know, famously they were iPhone 4, 4S,
[20:57.440 --> 21:01.440]  iPhone 5, 5S, iPhone 6, 6S.
[21:01.440 --> 21:05.400]  And, you know, the iPhone 7 and sorta knocks,
[21:05.400 --> 21:06.760]  is when they first knocked off that.
[21:06.760 --> 21:11.760]  But those six years of like 4, 4S, 5, 5S, 6, 6S,
[21:12.240 --> 21:14.040]  I know lots and lots of people.
[21:14.040 --> 21:17.040]  And if you're a semi-enthusiast,
[21:17.040 --> 21:21.640]  a two-year upgrade cycle is super normal, super sensible.
[21:21.640 --> 21:24.640]  And if you're less of an enthusiast,
[21:24.640 --> 21:27.800]  going more, as many years as you can between upgrading,
[21:27.800 --> 21:29.920]  and everybody has family members who are like that,
[21:29.920 --> 21:33.760]  like my mom just waited until the battery health was like,
[21:33.760 --> 21:36.400]  you know, practically begging her.
[21:36.400 --> 21:38.880]  Seriously, we're not really trying to sell you a new iPhone,
[21:38.880 --> 21:42.960]  but this iPhone 6 is, you know, really, really,
[21:42.960 --> 21:44.400]  the battery's not that good.
[21:44.400 --> 21:46.200]  I remember from that era,
[21:46.200 --> 21:48.320]  a lot of daring Fireball readers,
[21:48.320 --> 21:50.560]  after reviews would drop and every year,
[21:50.560 --> 21:53.640]  and a lot of them would say, I'm on the S cycle.
[21:53.640 --> 21:55.720]  I upgrade every two years, I'm on the S cycle,
[21:55.720 --> 21:57.700]  and I could not be happier for it.
[21:57.700 --> 22:01.800]  I think the S, every year, these S phones come out,
[22:01.800 --> 22:03.920]  and so many of the reviews are like,
[22:03.920 --> 22:06.440]  ah, it's, you know, looks just like last year's phone,
[22:06.440 --> 22:08.200]  it's an incremental upgrade.
[22:08.200 --> 22:10.720]  And they're like, I love the incremental upgrades
[22:10.720 --> 22:12.320]  because it's like, they've take, you know,
[22:12.320 --> 22:15.120]  and then they would name like their two or three pet
[22:15.120 --> 22:17.680]  compromises from the one-year-old phone
[22:17.680 --> 22:20.280]  that were fixed in the S cycle.
[22:20.280 --> 22:24.720]  And, you know, they're calling this the iPhone 13.
[22:24.720 --> 22:27.520]  And I, you know,
[22:27.520 --> 22:30.200]  I get why they don't use the S thing much anymore.
[22:30.200 --> 22:32.360]  They did it with the XS, which was,
[22:32.360 --> 22:36.320]  it was not quite clearly like the old school S upgrade,
[22:36.320 --> 22:39.840]  because there was also the XR, which was there with it,
[22:39.840 --> 22:44.300]  and brought the iPhone X style to a much lower price point.
[22:45.780 --> 22:47.520]  I get it for marketing reasons,
[22:47.520 --> 22:50.480]  that the S maybe signals to too many people
[22:50.480 --> 22:52.480]  that it is a minor upgrade, right?
[22:52.480 --> 22:54.720]  That it's like screaming minor upgrade.
[22:54.720 --> 22:56.780]  It's kind of curious they ever used it.
[22:58.400 --> 22:59.580]  But in other ways, you know,
[22:59.580 --> 23:02.900]  you could think of these as sort of like the 12S, right?
[23:02.900 --> 23:05.800]  And sometimes I guess with the S phones,
[23:05.800 --> 23:07.600]  they were so close physically
[23:07.600 --> 23:11.000]  that you could just use the same cases as the year before,
[23:11.000 --> 23:16.000]  or they would tweak the cases like by half of a millimeter,
[23:16.180 --> 23:18.080]  but they would still say it's compatible.
[23:18.080 --> 23:21.520]  This case is compatible with both the 5S and the 5
[23:21.520 --> 23:22.920]  when the new cases came out.
[23:24.120 --> 23:26.620]  To me, the iPhone, that's what the iPhone 13 is like.
[23:26.620 --> 23:28.680]  And I don't mean it to belittle it,
[23:28.680 --> 23:32.040]  I just think it is, it's like key
[23:32.040 --> 23:33.640]  is what you just mentioned to me,
[23:33.640 --> 23:37.200]  is that if you prefer the smaller 6.1 inch size
[23:37.200 --> 23:40.440]  to the max 6.7 inch size,
[23:40.440 --> 23:44.600]  it's fantastic that you get the exact same camera system
[23:44.600 --> 23:48.520]  and both have been upgraded with faster lenses,
[23:48.520 --> 23:51.840]  including a much faster, super ultra wide,
[23:51.840 --> 23:55.760]  the 0.5X lens, which also shoots macro.
[23:55.760 --> 24:00.360]  And now the telephoto has gone from 2X
[24:00.360 --> 24:04.600]  at that size range to 3X, which is a lot more throw.
[24:04.600 --> 24:05.600]  And they're just the same.
[24:05.600 --> 24:08.600]  And all you have to do is pick which size you like better.
[24:08.600 --> 24:10.220]  And it's a little bit more than just like
[24:10.220 --> 24:11.500]  which size you like better in your hand,
[24:11.500 --> 24:14.760]  because you do get super duper more battery life
[24:14.760 --> 24:16.720]  with the Pro Max, right?
[24:16.720 --> 24:18.600]  Right, right, not to be overlooked, right.
[24:18.600 --> 24:21.080]  And so, let's face it,
[24:21.080 --> 24:23.120]  one of the things that's overlooked in all of this,
[24:23.120 --> 24:26.460]  to me, overlooked by a lot, is how many people,
[24:26.460 --> 24:30.000]  their iPhone is their primary computer.
[24:30.000 --> 24:34.600]  And at a consumer level, there's a lot of people
[24:34.600 --> 24:36.840]  who just don't own another computer, right?
[24:36.840 --> 24:39.280]  And maybe it's even just a price thing
[24:39.280 --> 24:41.260]  and you're young and you're a student
[24:41.260 --> 24:44.120]  or you're just low income for whatever reason
[24:44.120 --> 24:48.840]  and owning a high-end, a nice iPhone is,
[24:48.840 --> 24:50.420]  that's your budget for a computer.
[24:50.420 --> 24:53.080]  But for a lot of people, it's just like their lifestyle,
[24:53.080 --> 24:56.080]  right, that they're just on their feet all day.
[24:56.080 --> 24:59.080]  We just watched the new episode of the season opener
[24:59.080 --> 25:02.080]  of The Morning Show with all these TV people.
[25:02.080 --> 25:04.480]  And I know there's this whole subset of,
[25:04.480 --> 25:08.040]  oh, Apple makes them put iPhones into all these shows
[25:08.040 --> 25:09.580]  on Apple TV Plus.
[25:09.580 --> 25:11.320]  But I think that's a realistic depiction
[25:11.320 --> 25:13.400]  of life as a TV executive.
[25:13.400 --> 25:14.920]  Yeah, I think so.
[25:14.920 --> 25:16.360]  I think as a modern media executive,
[25:16.360 --> 25:19.640]  if you have an Android phone, good luck to you.
[25:19.640 --> 25:21.960]  Right, like Ted Lasso has a lot of iPhones in it.
[25:21.960 --> 25:25.120]  But it's not people walking around all scene,
[25:25.120 --> 25:26.880]  every scene with their iPhone in front of them.
[25:26.880 --> 25:30.200]  Whereas the media executives on the show
[25:30.200 --> 25:32.020]  have their phones in front of them all the time.
[25:32.020 --> 25:33.440]  And that's true, they do.
[25:33.440 --> 25:35.640]  And if you're that sort of person,
[25:35.640 --> 25:37.020]  getting the Macs makes sense.
[25:37.020 --> 25:40.060]  Like if you're on your phone from your morning commute
[25:40.060 --> 25:42.880]  until you get home and have a chance to plug it in,
[25:42.880 --> 25:43.720]  it makes sense.
[25:44.720 --> 25:48.400]  Totally, if you use a laptop, you know,
[25:48.400 --> 25:51.760]  20% of the day or 10% of the day,
[25:51.760 --> 25:53.640]  and your phone 70% of the day,
[25:53.640 --> 25:55.260]  I mean, it makes a lot of sense to say,
[25:55.260 --> 25:57.880]  hey, I need a big typing surface.
[25:57.880 --> 25:59.820]  I want to see these emails.
[25:59.820 --> 26:00.660]  I want to read them closely.
[26:00.660 --> 26:03.900]  And I have to say, it's very, very easy
[26:03.900 --> 26:05.800]  to poo poo the larger size and go,
[26:05.800 --> 26:08.520]  oh, you could type just as well until you get older.
[26:08.520 --> 26:11.380]  And then you're like, hey, you know what would be great?
[26:11.380 --> 26:12.680]  If I could see anything.
[26:12.680 --> 26:14.400]  That would be awesome.
[26:14.400 --> 26:17.040]  And I think that it's obviously a big hit for those.
[26:17.040 --> 26:18.680]  You know, if you put do bigger font,
[26:18.680 --> 26:21.360]  you got more screen real estate, you know, that's a factor.
[26:21.360 --> 26:22.180]  Right.
[26:23.480 --> 26:27.520]  The other thing too is, and I know you and I
[26:27.520 --> 26:29.600]  commit a little bit during the review period.
[26:29.600 --> 26:31.880]  We're not like competitive with each other.
[26:31.880 --> 26:34.360]  It's not, you know, there's, you know,
[26:34.360 --> 26:35.600]  people who are, you know,
[26:35.600 --> 26:37.640]  basically people who've come on my show,
[26:37.640 --> 26:40.760]  like you and Joanna, it's like, well,
[26:40.760 --> 26:43.800]  we'll commit sometimes or ask questions, you know,
[26:43.800 --> 26:45.400]  while we're reviewing these phones.
[26:45.400 --> 26:46.220]  But for the-
[26:46.220 --> 26:47.280]  Gut checks can be helpful too.
[26:47.280 --> 26:48.560]  Make sure you're not an outlier.
[26:48.560 --> 26:49.700]  Yeah, gut checks, right.
[26:49.700 --> 26:50.920]  But for the most part,
[26:50.920 --> 26:53.800]  one of my fears always with these reviews
[26:53.800 --> 26:56.000]  is that I'm going to publish my review that, you know,
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.040]  this is, I've had six days with this thing
[26:58.040 --> 27:00.560]  and I've tried to devote as much time to it as I can.
[27:00.560 --> 27:03.220]  And think about it from consumer's perspective
[27:03.220 --> 27:05.920]  and my audience's perspective in particular.
[27:05.920 --> 27:07.040]  And here's the thoughts.
[27:07.040 --> 27:07.880]  And then I'm worried,
[27:07.880 --> 27:09.480]  I'm going to look at everybody else's reviews
[27:09.480 --> 27:12.280]  and they're all going to complain about X
[27:12.280 --> 27:13.120]  or they're all going to say-
[27:13.120 --> 27:16.200]  But you're going to just totally miss a huge flaw.
[27:16.200 --> 27:17.480]  Yeah, miss a huge flaw.
[27:17.480 --> 27:19.200]  You know, maybe the closest to that
[27:19.200 --> 27:21.640]  was when the cellular Apple watch came out.
[27:21.640 --> 27:23.680]  There was like a weird glitch
[27:23.680 --> 27:24.520]  where some people were saying-
[27:24.520 --> 27:25.640]  Right, a wifi issue.
[27:25.640 --> 27:26.780]  Yeah.
[27:26.780 --> 27:29.120]  And that I had never encountered it.
[27:29.120 --> 27:30.920]  I think it was like that it would like latch
[27:30.920 --> 27:35.000]  onto a public wifi, but it needed a authentication.
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.300]  But therefore, because it was latched onto the wifi,
[27:37.300 --> 27:39.880]  it needed an authentication that the watch itself
[27:39.880 --> 27:42.480]  wasn't capable of prompting you for.
[27:42.480 --> 27:44.520]  You know, like a coffee shop that says like,
[27:44.520 --> 27:46.400]  oh, okay, it's a known network.
[27:46.400 --> 27:47.320]  So I'll latch onto it.
[27:47.320 --> 27:49.800]  But the coffee shop wants you to like type a password
[27:49.800 --> 27:50.880]  or something like that, that you-
[27:50.880 --> 27:54.280]  Yeah, the capture gateways that like hotels use.
[27:54.280 --> 27:55.980]  Yeah, it was something like that.
[27:57.000 --> 28:00.100]  But you know, but for the most part this year,
[28:00.100 --> 28:02.260]  I thought there was a remarkable consensus,
[28:02.260 --> 28:03.840]  which was my thrust, which was look,
[28:03.840 --> 28:06.240]  they made the cameras better, a lot better,
[28:06.240 --> 28:09.280]  noticeably better in ways that like real people
[28:09.280 --> 28:13.420]  will really take better photos and better videos.
[28:13.420 --> 28:17.280]  And they have significantly improved battery life
[28:17.280 --> 28:19.160]  in a very practical way.
[28:19.160 --> 28:22.380]  And better cameras and better battery life
[28:22.380 --> 28:24.400]  are literally the main things.
[28:24.400 --> 28:25.400]  I know there's the whole,
[28:25.400 --> 28:27.140]  you can't just ask people what they want
[28:27.140 --> 28:29.080]  because they'd say they want faster horses
[28:29.080 --> 28:32.180]  instead of knowing that they should switch automobiles.
[28:32.180 --> 28:33.880]  But people know what they do with their iPhones.
[28:33.880 --> 28:36.680]  And you know, people like more battery life
[28:36.680 --> 28:40.020]  and people, everybody, almost everybody uses the camera.
[28:41.400 --> 28:42.240]  Right.
[28:44.160 --> 28:46.440]  It's just not that, it's not rocket science, right?
[28:46.440 --> 28:48.040]  Like you go into these things going,
[28:48.040 --> 28:50.000]  oh, I wonder what, you know, what am I gonna miss?
[28:50.000 --> 28:51.280]  What angles am I gonna get?
[28:51.280 --> 28:53.320]  And I think sometimes people overthink it
[28:53.320 --> 28:55.960]  and you don't need to overthink what people want
[28:55.960 --> 28:58.680]  from their smartphone in a lot of cases these days.
[28:58.680 --> 29:01.800]  Because you know absolutely it is their primary camera
[29:01.800 --> 29:06.080]  that ship sailed in like 2014 or something, right?
[29:06.080 --> 29:08.360]  So you know it's their primary camera
[29:08.360 --> 29:10.220]  and you know that they use it a lot
[29:10.220 --> 29:12.880]  because every app statistic on the planet
[29:12.880 --> 29:15.340]  will tell you that people are using their phones
[29:15.340 --> 29:16.180]  more and more.
[29:16.180 --> 29:17.920]  And what is the result of that?
[29:17.920 --> 29:19.200]  Well, battery, right?
[29:19.200 --> 29:22.920]  So like those two things are not for overthinkers, right?
[29:22.920 --> 29:25.640]  And I think that sometimes people get into overthinking it
[29:25.640 --> 29:29.520]  and therefore undervalue those basics, right?
[29:29.520 --> 29:32.060]  They undervalue those simple, they're like,
[29:32.060 --> 29:34.680]  oh, surely it can't just be somebody buys this
[29:34.680 --> 29:36.640]  because it has 12% more battery.
[29:36.640 --> 29:40.460]  It's like, well, yeah, because it's a binary decision.
[29:40.460 --> 29:43.200]  Does it have more battery or less, right?
[29:43.200 --> 29:45.640]  Not, oh, does it have 17%?
[29:45.640 --> 29:47.240]  Now I'm convinced.
[29:47.240 --> 29:48.960]  It's like, no, does it have more battery?
[29:48.960 --> 29:50.160]  Okay, I'll buy that one, right?
[29:50.160 --> 29:53.560]  Most people are not sitting there looking at a chart.
[29:53.560 --> 29:55.780]  Like I put charts in my reviews time to time
[29:55.780 --> 29:58.040]  because I know some people like that and that's great.
[29:58.040 --> 30:00.920]  And obviously I need to do the measurements myself
[30:00.920 --> 30:03.040]  to contextualize my feelings.
[30:03.040 --> 30:05.640]  So I do the measurements, but most people are not.
[30:05.640 --> 30:07.740]  They're like, is it more about, oh, is that more battery?
[30:07.740 --> 30:08.580]  Oh, cool.
[30:08.580 --> 30:09.480]  And then when they go to order it,
[30:09.480 --> 30:10.800]  they just order the one with more battery.
[30:10.800 --> 30:14.960]  And that's not, you don't need to overthink that too much.
[30:14.960 --> 30:16.800]  Tim Cook talks about that a lot
[30:16.800 --> 30:18.240]  when he talks about Apple Watch.
[30:18.240 --> 30:20.960]  And you know, it comes up so often
[30:20.960 --> 30:23.620]  that I know it's not a talking point
[30:23.620 --> 30:25.080]  because he's said it for years,
[30:25.080 --> 30:27.760]  but that the thing he loves most about Apple Watch
[30:27.760 --> 30:29.520]  is that he's been a fitness enthusiast
[30:29.520 --> 30:31.600]  since long before Apple Watch.
[30:31.600 --> 30:32.760]  But there were things he thought
[30:32.760 --> 30:34.520]  he was accomplishing each day
[30:34.520 --> 30:37.720]  that it turns out he wasn't until he got the numbers.
[30:37.720 --> 30:40.920]  And it's, I got some, you know,
[30:40.920 --> 30:42.820]  maybe some pushback I got last year.
[30:42.820 --> 30:46.500]  I gave a very, very positive review to the iPhone 12 mini.
[30:46.500 --> 30:50.880]  And I was very close to buying the iPhone 12 mini
[30:50.880 --> 30:52.920]  as my personal phone for the last year.
[30:52.920 --> 30:55.560]  It was the closest call I've ever had
[30:55.560 --> 30:58.280]  in all the years of multiple new iPhones
[30:58.280 --> 31:00.360]  of deciding which one to buy.
[31:00.360 --> 31:03.480]  Because I was so enamored with it in so many ways,
[31:03.480 --> 31:08.480]  like its weight and the low amount of volume
[31:08.800 --> 31:11.120]  it takes up in a jeans pocket.
[31:11.120 --> 31:13.180]  Battery life was not the reason
[31:13.180 --> 31:16.180]  that I went with the 12 instead of the 12 mini.
[31:16.180 --> 31:18.240]  For me, it was typing.
[31:18.240 --> 31:21.260]  And even though the 12 mini is a size
[31:21.260 --> 31:24.120]  that's very comparable keyboard,
[31:24.120 --> 31:27.740]  the physical keyboard on the iPhone mini size
[31:27.740 --> 31:32.140]  is very comparable to the old iPhones of yesteryear,
[31:32.140 --> 31:36.000]  my thumbs have lost their ability to type at that speed.
[31:36.000 --> 31:38.600]  And I very specifically remember
[31:38.600 --> 31:43.600]  that it was during the six day election of 2020,
[31:44.840 --> 31:46.820]  where it was, or five days, you know,
[31:46.820 --> 31:51.520]  five days from election day until Saturday morning
[31:51.520 --> 31:53.800]  when CNN or whoever it was the first to call it
[31:53.800 --> 31:57.160]  and said, we're calling it, Joe Biden is the winner.
[31:57.160 --> 31:59.840]  And I remember I watched an awful lot of TV
[31:59.840 --> 32:04.440]  in those five days and I was using the 12 mini
[32:04.440 --> 32:06.000]  as my main phone.
[32:06.000 --> 32:09.320]  And I was like, I am making so many typos
[32:09.320 --> 32:10.740]  and I'm trying to do all this stuff,
[32:10.740 --> 32:13.800]  but I cannot leave the couch to leave to get something else
[32:13.800 --> 32:15.480]  because what if Steve Kornacki comes on
[32:15.480 --> 32:19.280]  and tells me something about County Georgia?
[32:19.280 --> 32:20.720]  Oh my God, I can't leave.
[32:20.720 --> 32:22.800]  So I was just on the 12 mini.
[32:22.800 --> 32:25.480]  And you know, it was the pandemic, I wasn't leaving.
[32:25.480 --> 32:28.400]  I could easily plug the mini in for five minutes
[32:28.400 --> 32:30.400]  here and there while I got a beverage
[32:30.400 --> 32:32.560]  or you know, MSNBC cut to commercial.
[32:32.560 --> 32:34.080]  And so I wasn't running out of battery.
[32:34.080 --> 32:36.840]  It was the typing of all things, the typing.
[32:36.840 --> 32:39.440]  And so I was like, you know what, I'm gonna buy a 12.
[32:39.440 --> 32:40.440]  Yeah.
[32:40.440 --> 32:41.820]  But yeah, I mean, that's the same reason
[32:41.820 --> 32:42.660]  I didn't go with the mini.
[32:42.660 --> 32:43.920]  I really, I love everything about it,
[32:43.920 --> 32:47.860]  but my meaty thumbs can't handle it, unfortunately.
[32:47.860 --> 32:48.700]  I wish they could.
[32:48.700 --> 32:50.160]  And it's crazy because they used to be able to,
[32:50.160 --> 32:51.280]  I mean, I used to be there.
[32:51.280 --> 32:53.800]  But they used to be able to,
[32:53.800 --> 32:55.640]  because we all used to type on that side screen.
[32:55.640 --> 32:56.720]  That's what's hilarious about it.
[32:56.720 --> 32:58.140]  But now we can't, we can't do it anymore.
[32:58.140 --> 32:58.980]  Right.
[32:58.980 --> 33:02.680]  But all that said, but the battery life was a compromise.
[33:02.680 --> 33:06.240]  It was seriously, it was a bit compromised on battery life.
[33:06.240 --> 33:08.600]  And you know, that was definitely a hit.
[33:08.600 --> 33:09.920]  And there were people are like, yeah,
[33:09.920 --> 33:11.380]  you should have called out the battery life more.
[33:11.380 --> 33:13.480]  And it's like, well, you know,
[33:13.480 --> 33:15.400]  to me it was within what Apple said.
[33:15.400 --> 33:17.520]  Like if, you know, like if Apple said,
[33:17.520 --> 33:19.560]  I don't know what the numbers were for the hours,
[33:19.560 --> 33:23.720]  but you know, if it said it was only 66% of the battery life
[33:23.720 --> 33:25.920]  of the 12 Pro or something like that,
[33:25.920 --> 33:27.120]  it's like, I think that was fair.
[33:27.120 --> 33:29.140]  That might be a deal breaker for you.
[33:29.140 --> 33:32.380]  You know, only having two thirds of the battery life.
[33:32.380 --> 33:34.080]  And so to me, that was a compromise.
[33:34.080 --> 33:35.840]  And one of the most amazing things
[33:35.840 --> 33:37.480]  about the battery life improvements
[33:37.480 --> 33:42.480]  with the iPhone 13 lineup is that this year's iPhone 13 mini
[33:44.440 --> 33:48.520]  gets longer battery life than last year's mid-size,
[33:48.520 --> 33:51.580]  regular size, whatever you wanna call it, iPhone 12.
[33:51.580 --> 33:54.960]  So that to me is removing the compromise.
[33:54.960 --> 33:57.680]  And sure, the mini, the 13 mini still has
[33:57.680 --> 34:00.280]  the lowest battery life of all the iPhone 13
[34:00.280 --> 34:03.220]  for the obvious reason that it has the smallest battery.
[34:03.220 --> 34:07.720]  But that's a huge one year over one year gain
[34:07.720 --> 34:12.160]  that the mini size now has a longer lasting battery
[34:12.160 --> 34:14.120]  by every measure you can think of
[34:14.120 --> 34:17.480]  than last year's regular sized iPhone 12.
[34:17.480 --> 34:19.400]  That's amazing.
[34:19.400 --> 34:21.240]  Yeah, that's a huge leap in one year.
[34:21.240 --> 34:25.360]  And if you're talking about compromise or whatever,
[34:25.360 --> 34:28.460]  it does delete an enormous amount of compromise
[34:28.460 --> 34:30.200]  that those people had to make last year,
[34:30.200 --> 34:31.960]  you know, the people choosing that phone.
[34:31.960 --> 34:34.880]  And it removes obviously the barrier
[34:34.880 --> 34:38.160]  for a lot of people that would have bought that last year,
[34:38.160 --> 34:42.360]  but felt like, oh man, I run out of battery every day,
[34:42.360 --> 34:47.240]  today already, you know, I can't go to less, right?
[34:47.240 --> 34:50.460]  And that's a definite leap forward.
[34:50.460 --> 34:54.960]  Yeah, so the two big compromises
[34:54.960 --> 34:57.160]  that they eliminated year over year,
[34:57.160 --> 34:59.680]  the mini no longer has bad battery life
[34:59.680 --> 35:01.760]  and now has perfectly adequate
[35:01.760 --> 35:04.680]  by anybody's definition battery life for the size.
[35:04.680 --> 35:09.680]  And the mid-sized 13 Pro has the exact same camera system
[35:11.440 --> 35:15.060]  as the Pro Max and they made both cameras better.
[35:15.060 --> 35:20.040]  Very, very impressive to me year over year.
[35:20.040 --> 35:21.480]  I wanna keep talking about the camera stuff,
[35:21.480 --> 35:23.140]  but I'm gonna take another break here
[35:23.140 --> 35:24.560]  and thank our friends.
[35:24.560 --> 35:28.520]  Oh man, I love Memberful.
[35:28.520 --> 35:31.240]  Memberful is how you can monetize your passion
[35:31.240 --> 35:32.180]  with memberships.
[35:32.180 --> 35:34.120]  Memberful allows you to build
[35:34.120 --> 35:37.220]  a sustainable recurring revenue.
[35:37.220 --> 35:40.280]  It is the easiest way to sell memberships to your audience.
[35:40.280 --> 35:42.800]  And it is used by some of the biggest creators on the web.
[35:42.800 --> 35:46.120]  It is used by many of my personal favorite sites,
[35:46.120 --> 35:47.400]  including those from my friends
[35:47.400 --> 35:49.640]  like Jason Snell at Six Colors.
[35:49.640 --> 35:53.240]  I'm a member of more Memberful sites
[35:53.240 --> 35:56.280]  than I can count on, definitely on one hand.
[35:56.280 --> 35:59.040]  One of the best things is that they never put their brand
[35:59.040 --> 35:59.960]  in front of yours.
[35:59.960 --> 36:02.280]  Like, so like once you're a member at Six Colors,
[36:02.280 --> 36:05.160]  let's just say, you're never like reminded
[36:05.160 --> 36:06.760]  that you're going through Memberful.
[36:06.760 --> 36:08.900]  It always just feels like you're going right through
[36:08.900 --> 36:12.520]  to Six Colors and you just never have to worry about it.
[36:12.520 --> 36:13.960]  And it couldn't be better.
[36:13.960 --> 36:15.720]  If you are the creator though,
[36:15.720 --> 36:17.080]  what a great advantage to you
[36:17.080 --> 36:18.560]  that you can have a partner like this
[36:18.560 --> 36:20.680]  who takes care of all the hard stuff,
[36:20.680 --> 36:22.480]  all of this infrastructure,
[36:22.480 --> 36:26.200]  and also doesn't dilute your own brand at all
[36:26.200 --> 36:30.560]  or get in the way of your direct communication
[36:30.560 --> 36:31.400]  with your audience.
[36:31.400 --> 36:34.680]  You have full control and ownership of your audience,
[36:34.680 --> 36:36.840]  your brand and your membership with Memberful.
[36:36.840 --> 36:39.660]  If you ever do wanna leave for whatever reason,
[36:39.660 --> 36:41.280]  you just take your whole audience with you.
[36:41.280 --> 36:43.360]  There's no lock-in and it's not like,
[36:43.360 --> 36:46.240]  ah, I wanna leave Memberful, but I can't get out.
[36:46.240 --> 36:47.160]  No, they'll let you out.
[36:47.160 --> 36:49.600]  That's how confident they are that you won't
[36:49.600 --> 36:52.640]  because it's such a great product and a great service.
[36:52.640 --> 36:54.360]  And you can get started for free.
[36:54.360 --> 36:58.440]  Try it out with no credit card required.
[36:58.440 --> 36:59.840]  It is just a great system.
[36:59.840 --> 37:04.600]  I am so happy to be a member of so many Memberful sites.
[37:04.600 --> 37:07.520]  And again, they handle all the hard stuff,
[37:07.520 --> 37:11.160]  the credit card stuff, the credit card expiration stuff,
[37:11.160 --> 37:12.560]  which is like a mess, right?
[37:12.560 --> 37:15.100]  It's like somebody subscribes in June
[37:15.100 --> 37:17.820]  and then their card expires in January
[37:17.820 --> 37:18.920]  and then the renewal comes up.
[37:18.920 --> 37:21.560]  Memberful handles all of that stuff.
[37:21.560 --> 37:23.440]  Where do you go to find out more?
[37:23.440 --> 37:27.040]  If you wanna get started and monetize your passion,
[37:27.040 --> 37:32.040]  go to Memberful, M-E-M-B-E-R, Memberful, F-U-L.com,
[37:33.120 --> 37:34.400]  slash talk show.
[37:34.400 --> 37:37.760]  That's Memberful.com slash talk show.
[37:37.760 --> 37:42.040]  My thanks to Memberful for their continuing support
[37:42.040 --> 37:42.880]  of the talk show.
[37:45.840 --> 37:49.440]  The iPhone 13 camera system.
[37:49.440 --> 37:51.760]  Number one, I kind of feel, if regrets,
[37:51.760 --> 37:53.700]  I don't have many regrets with my review.
[37:53.700 --> 37:55.360]  Every year, I'm a mess.
[37:55.360 --> 37:56.760]  I never make the embargo.
[37:56.760 --> 37:59.360]  I came closer this year than I have sometimes.
[37:59.360 --> 38:00.400]  So there've been times when I've,
[38:00.400 --> 38:02.440]  it's like the sun has dropped and I've-
[38:02.440 --> 38:03.480]  I didn't make it this year either.
[38:03.480 --> 38:06.600]  I mean, there's a reason it's not until then or after,
[38:06.600 --> 38:07.440]  right? Right.
[38:07.440 --> 38:09.440]  Everybody raises the publish right away and I get it.
[38:09.440 --> 38:12.800]  And I got, I get agita over it every year as well.
[38:12.800 --> 38:16.640]  But I figure at some point you gotta do the best job you can.
[38:16.640 --> 38:19.400]  It's good to have a deadline, especially for me,
[38:19.400 --> 38:21.720]  cause there's no boss that I report to who's gonna,
[38:21.720 --> 38:23.360]  you know, be bugging me,
[38:23.360 --> 38:25.400]  but it's good to have that pressure.
[38:25.400 --> 38:26.720]  You know, like you're not gonna,
[38:26.720 --> 38:28.800]  if you don't hit the exact embargo,
[38:28.800 --> 38:30.960]  you're not gonna be the top review
[38:30.960 --> 38:33.840]  in the tech meme leaderboard for the thing,
[38:33.840 --> 38:35.000]  but that's fine with me.
[38:35.000 --> 38:38.200]  People wait, you know, but I, you know, I wanna get it out,
[38:38.200 --> 38:40.720]  but it's harder.
[38:40.720 --> 38:43.080]  And I mentioned this, I forget if I wrote about it.
[38:43.080 --> 38:45.040]  I think I wrote about it when I was talking about the fact
[38:45.040 --> 38:47.440]  that the Microsoft Surface event had,
[38:47.440 --> 38:50.360]  the event itself did not have a live audience
[38:50.360 --> 38:51.800]  for COVID reasons,
[38:51.800 --> 38:55.720]  but they did have hands-on area
[38:55.720 --> 38:58.480]  of all with COVID protocols, but in small groups,
[38:58.480 --> 39:01.080]  but they had hands-on time for people in the press
[39:01.080 --> 39:03.800]  and in-person product briefings.
[39:03.800 --> 39:04.840]  And I miss that.
[39:04.840 --> 39:08.080]  I find in-person briefings so much more effective
[39:08.080 --> 39:09.640]  for communicating,
[39:09.640 --> 39:12.400]  and it's really starting to wear thin to me
[39:12.400 --> 39:13.360]  that we've had.
[39:13.360 --> 39:15.200]  And again, I don't blame Apple.
[39:15.200 --> 39:17.400]  There's no way they could have held an in-person event
[39:17.400 --> 39:21.560]  in September of any size for the iPhone,
[39:21.560 --> 39:23.560]  because there's no way to cut the iPhone's event size,
[39:23.560 --> 39:26.760]  the press list down to a manageable level for COVID.
[39:26.760 --> 39:27.960]  So I'm not saying they should have,
[39:27.960 --> 39:29.600]  I'm just saying I miss it.
[39:29.600 --> 39:32.880]  But the other thing is that even that one extra day
[39:32.880 --> 39:34.760]  makes such a difference to me, right?
[39:34.760 --> 39:37.120]  So if like the embargo is also on Tuesday morning
[39:37.120 --> 39:38.200]  and it's a Tuesday,
[39:38.200 --> 39:42.800]  if it's in-person, you get the product Tuesday afternoon,
[39:42.800 --> 39:45.560]  and if it's not in-person, they ship them,
[39:45.560 --> 39:49.120]  and at best you get them Wednesday afternoon.
[39:49.120 --> 39:52.640]  And it's six days versus seven days.
[39:52.640 --> 39:56.000]  Well, that's 16% more time that you have with the product,
[39:56.000 --> 39:57.640]  which is, right?
[39:58.640 --> 39:59.480]  It's not nothing.
[39:59.480 --> 40:00.760]  Yeah, no, it's true.
[40:00.760 --> 40:03.600]  And it's a time crunch
[40:03.600 --> 40:04.920]  to get all the tests you want done.
[40:04.920 --> 40:07.560]  And that first day, my goal,
[40:07.560 --> 40:10.160]  my only goal really the first day is to unbox everything,
[40:10.160 --> 40:14.080]  take a peek at it and immediately start all of the updates.
[40:14.080 --> 40:19.080]  And what you do is you get the sleep time back, right?
[40:19.080 --> 40:22.080]  Because your sleep time is spent with all of those devices
[40:22.080 --> 40:25.440]  using your wifi to slurp all of their apps down from,
[40:25.440 --> 40:27.280]  well, you know, with my method,
[40:27.280 --> 40:32.040]  slurp them down from the app store and to start indexing.
[40:32.040 --> 40:36.760]  I don't start any battery tests until several days later,
[40:36.760 --> 40:39.440]  because I like to give them a time to index.
[40:39.440 --> 40:42.600]  And I don't test fresh iPhones.
[40:42.600 --> 40:45.040]  I test them as people would,
[40:45.040 --> 40:46.120]  and I know you do the same,
[40:46.120 --> 40:48.480]  as people would do buy a new iPhone.
[40:48.480 --> 40:50.040]  They buy a new iPhone, they're gonna update it
[40:50.040 --> 40:53.760]  or restore it from their backup and start using it.
[40:53.760 --> 40:55.280]  Almost nobody, I would guess,
[40:55.280 --> 40:58.240]  a very small portion of the population starts fresh.
[40:58.240 --> 41:00.240]  So you need to have that same experience
[41:00.240 --> 41:01.720]  that the person buying it is gonna be
[41:01.720 --> 41:04.040]  to give it the proper evaluation.
[41:04.040 --> 41:07.400]  So you download everything and you let it start indexing.
[41:07.400 --> 41:10.120]  And I don't wanna evaluate based on the time
[41:10.120 --> 41:12.640]  while it's indexing, because that's obviously awful.
[41:12.640 --> 41:15.920]  But that 12 hours is extremely helpful
[41:15.920 --> 41:19.200]  in letting it run all night and index and back up.
[41:19.200 --> 41:22.520]  And by the morning, I have semi-functioning devices
[41:22.520 --> 41:23.800]  that are indexing in the background,
[41:23.800 --> 41:25.760]  but that I can start running preliminary testing
[41:25.760 --> 41:27.760]  on my cameras and stuff.
[41:27.760 --> 41:29.480]  And just on the cameras alone.
[41:29.480 --> 41:31.160]  So there's battery life, there's that.
[41:31.160 --> 41:34.440]  You need, like you said, it's exactly what you said.
[41:34.440 --> 41:36.440]  You need at least maybe 48 hours
[41:36.440 --> 41:37.880]  before you can say that the phone,
[41:37.880 --> 41:40.840]  even if you set it up as soon as it's in your hands,
[41:40.840 --> 41:43.920]  24, 36, 48 hours before you can start talking,
[41:43.920 --> 41:48.560]  evaluating battery life in a fair sense is true.
[41:48.560 --> 41:51.160]  And on the cameras alone, this year, testing,
[41:51.160 --> 41:54.640]  I devoted my time to the phone I was most interested in,
[41:54.640 --> 41:58.200]  the 6.1-inch midsize 13 Pro.
[41:58.200 --> 42:01.120]  All three camera lenses are new.
[42:01.120 --> 42:04.680]  The 3x lens is new with a new sensor.
[42:04.680 --> 42:06.840]  It's a new lens and a new sensor.
[42:06.840 --> 42:09.480]  The regular default 1x lens
[42:09.480 --> 42:13.320]  has an even bigger pixels on the sensor.
[42:13.320 --> 42:14.800]  And the bigger pixels on the sensor
[42:14.800 --> 42:17.240]  is one of the single biggest changes they can make
[42:17.240 --> 42:19.200]  to make it a more effective camera.
[42:19.200 --> 42:24.200]  And the 0.5x lens, which has gotten the least love
[42:24.200 --> 42:28.280]  over the years in terms of functional improvements
[42:28.280 --> 42:31.600]  on the Pros this year is a huge upgrade,
[42:31.600 --> 42:35.200]  a better sensor with autofocus now.
[42:35.200 --> 42:37.000]  You could quibble over whether
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  it should be called autofocus or not,
[42:39.000 --> 42:40.920]  but it has a focusing system,
[42:40.920 --> 42:43.400]  which the previous ones were all fixed focus,
[42:43.400 --> 42:45.240]  more light-gathering capability,
[42:45.240 --> 42:47.680]  so it's more useful indoors, so all three lenses.
[42:47.680 --> 42:49.640]  So even if you're just talking stills
[42:49.640 --> 42:50.800]  and just regular stills
[42:50.800 --> 42:52.120]  and not even talking portrait mode,
[42:52.120 --> 42:55.480]  you've got three lenses to evaluate and take pictures of.
[42:55.480 --> 42:57.920]  And then there's a macro mode.
[43:00.800 --> 43:02.280]  Then there is portrait mode,
[43:02.280 --> 43:05.000]  which you can take at two different focal lengths.
[43:05.000 --> 43:06.800]  And now with video,
[43:06.800 --> 43:09.560]  they added an entirely new cinematic.
[43:09.560 --> 43:11.880]  It's like seven different cameras you have to evaluate.
[43:11.880 --> 43:12.720]  There's no chance.
[43:12.720 --> 43:16.520]  And I don't do, sometimes in years past,
[43:16.520 --> 43:18.280]  a couple of years ago when I first added night mode,
[43:18.280 --> 43:21.480]  I had a photo, actual photos in my review,
[43:21.480 --> 43:23.000]  much heavier than usual.
[43:23.000 --> 43:25.760]  When I went to my friend Lee's Hopsing Laundromat,
[43:25.760 --> 43:29.840]  which is a very dark, beautiful, beautiful,
[43:29.840 --> 43:32.520]  beautiful cocktail bar here in Philadelphia,
[43:32.520 --> 43:34.880]  but he was kind enough to let me come in
[43:34.880 --> 43:36.000]  while they were closed.
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.640]  And it was literally just candlelight,
[43:38.640 --> 43:40.400]  no electrical lighting at all.
[43:40.400 --> 43:41.880]  He just lit the candles like he would
[43:41.880 --> 43:43.680]  when they were open in the evening.
[43:43.680 --> 43:45.000]  And I took a bunch of photos
[43:45.000 --> 43:49.680]  and included them in my review to show photo
[43:49.680 --> 43:52.600]  or night mode versus the year over year camera.
[43:53.720 --> 43:55.320]  So I have done that sometimes,
[43:55.320 --> 43:58.440]  but I just, no surprise to anybody
[43:58.440 --> 43:59.280]  who's listening to my show,
[43:59.280 --> 44:01.960]  my reviews are usually less illustrated
[44:01.960 --> 44:04.640]  and more just textual.
[44:04.640 --> 44:06.080]  But I do take a lot of photos,
[44:06.080 --> 44:07.440]  even if I don't put them in a review.
[44:07.440 --> 44:09.000]  And there's just no time.
[44:09.000 --> 44:11.200]  There's just no possible way I could have done it all.
[44:11.200 --> 44:14.000]  So I did not shoot a lot of cinematic mode video
[44:14.000 --> 44:15.360]  before the review.
[44:15.360 --> 44:18.040]  But the one thing that I felt like
[44:18.040 --> 44:19.600]  I should have done more of,
[44:19.600 --> 44:22.520]  and I underestimated how much I truly love it
[44:22.520 --> 44:25.120]  and feel that it truly changes
[44:25.120 --> 44:28.440]  and expands the capabilities is macro.
[44:28.440 --> 44:30.680]  The macro, it blows my mind.
[44:30.680 --> 44:34.600]  That's my big, my single biggest one week later regret
[44:34.600 --> 44:38.880]  is that I didn't do more macro and praise macro more.
[44:40.440 --> 44:41.280]  Yeah.
[44:41.280 --> 44:43.880]  Yeah, I think the macro side of it
[44:43.880 --> 44:45.960]  is truly exciting for a lot of people
[44:45.960 --> 44:48.960]  because it is more accessible than telephoto shooting.
[44:48.960 --> 44:50.400]  Telephoto shooting is a weird one
[44:50.400 --> 44:52.600]  because it's not truly not like
[44:52.600 --> 44:54.160]  some sort of 300 millimeter telephoto.
[44:54.160 --> 44:55.560]  This is not a sports lens.
[44:55.560 --> 44:57.200]  It's more of a portraiture lens
[44:57.200 --> 44:59.600]  and it can be hard to decide when or when not to use it.
[44:59.600 --> 45:02.400]  But I think everybody understands the excitement
[45:02.400 --> 45:05.360]  and interesting ability that a macro,
[45:05.360 --> 45:07.560]  and it's like, oh, you could shoot things super close up.
[45:07.560 --> 45:08.600]  That's awesome, right?
[45:08.600 --> 45:12.680]  And people tend to, I think, use that kind of feature more
[45:12.680 --> 45:14.720]  because more things are closer to you, right?
[45:14.720 --> 45:16.400]  It's just one of those logical things.
[45:16.400 --> 45:18.680]  You're able to sort of shoot things
[45:18.680 --> 45:20.840]  that are right up next to you and get cool views.
[45:20.840 --> 45:23.720]  And everybody loves bugs and flowers and closeup stuff.
[45:23.720 --> 45:27.640]  And that aspect of it, I think is undersung
[45:27.640 --> 45:30.640]  because I think a lot of people treat macro
[45:30.640 --> 45:32.760]  as a specialty type of photography.
[45:32.760 --> 45:34.880]  But the reality is it doesn't have to be,
[45:34.880 --> 45:37.680]  it's just always required specialized equipment.
[45:37.680 --> 45:38.880]  And that's like been the big thing.
[45:38.880 --> 45:41.880]  Everybody would love it if the camera could shoot
[45:41.880 --> 45:44.440]  like super close up and get texture and all this,
[45:44.440 --> 45:46.840]  but it requires, oh, it requires this $1,000 lens
[45:46.840 --> 45:48.720]  and expertise and like you gotta hover
[45:48.720 --> 45:51.360]  and you gotta know how to focus and blah, blah, blah.
[45:51.360 --> 45:53.000]  It's just not accessible, right?
[45:53.000 --> 45:54.960]  And that's what this just changes.
[45:54.960 --> 45:59.960]  And Austin Mann had in his excellent as usual
[45:59.960 --> 46:04.520]  and not exotic at all photo review on it.
[46:04.520 --> 46:07.080]  Just like everybody, we're taking a little safari
[46:07.080 --> 46:07.920]  now and then.
[46:07.920 --> 46:11.080]  Yeah, a safari in Tanzania.
[46:11.080 --> 46:15.880]  But he had the best thing to say about macro
[46:15.880 --> 46:18.800]  that I could think of, but that he carries a macro lens
[46:18.800 --> 46:20.000]  with him everywhere he goes
[46:20.000 --> 46:21.480]  because he just wants to be able to capture that.
[46:21.480 --> 46:22.760]  And he's a professional photographer
[46:22.760 --> 46:24.560]  and he's super gifted and a very nice guy.
[46:24.560 --> 46:26.000]  I've met him several times.
[46:27.120 --> 46:29.960]  He's exactly like what he comes across in those videos.
[46:29.960 --> 46:32.640]  But he says, I carry a macro lens wherever I go
[46:32.640 --> 46:34.800]  just in case I see something that I want it.
[46:34.800 --> 46:36.240]  But it's A, like you said,
[46:36.240 --> 46:38.240]  they're like $1,000 starting point.
[46:38.240 --> 46:41.680]  And they're very heavy, they're really heavy glass.
[46:41.680 --> 46:45.000]  So like the professional photographers who are like,
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.120]  well, I need a telephoto and I need a normal lens
[46:47.120 --> 46:48.320]  and of course I need a wide angle,
[46:48.320 --> 46:49.920]  but I like to have a fisheye sometimes
[46:49.920 --> 46:52.040]  if it needs to count staying at all in a macro.
[46:52.040 --> 46:54.520]  And all of a sudden you've got 25 pounds of glass
[46:54.520 --> 46:56.000]  that you're carrying around on your back
[46:56.000 --> 46:57.480]  or everywhere you go.
[46:57.480 --> 46:59.760]  It's just not practical for consumers.
[46:59.760 --> 47:02.800]  And it's certainly not practical for like in your pocket
[47:02.800 --> 47:04.280]  walking around daily carry,
[47:04.280 --> 47:08.280]  or even if you carry like a backpack or a purse
[47:08.280 --> 47:10.560]  or something and you have room,
[47:10.560 --> 47:13.240]  it's just people don't, even if they take an extra lens,
[47:13.240 --> 47:14.560]  even if they walk around with a camera,
[47:14.560 --> 47:16.760]  they're not taking a macro lens, right?
[47:16.760 --> 47:19.280]  It's too obscure.
[47:19.280 --> 47:24.240]  And it is game-changing what you can get a photo of
[47:24.240 --> 47:26.320]  and how neat it is.
[47:26.320 --> 47:30.480]  And it's almost kind of nutty, right?
[47:30.480 --> 47:32.520]  That all of a sudden now it's just the thing
[47:32.520 --> 47:33.880]  that you were gonna buy anyway.
[47:33.880 --> 47:34.720]  Oh, and by the way,
[47:34.720 --> 47:38.400]  now you can take kind of extraordinary macro photography.
[47:38.400 --> 47:40.840]  And then in my review, I felt like I spent more time
[47:40.840 --> 47:42.960]  rather than praising what you can do with it,
[47:42.960 --> 47:47.680]  complaining about the automatic camera shift
[47:47.680 --> 47:51.160]  and the weird, it's sort of like-
[47:51.160 --> 47:52.960]  Yeah, the switch between the wide
[47:52.960 --> 47:54.400]  and telephoto that happens, yeah.
[47:54.400 --> 47:55.960]  Yeah, and I wish I had thought of this.
[47:55.960 --> 47:57.440]  And my other regret for the review
[47:57.440 --> 48:00.880]  is that I didn't describe it as like vertigo inducing.
[48:00.880 --> 48:03.520]  It's sort of like a vertigo feeling when it switches.
[48:03.520 --> 48:05.800]  And I spent more time complaining about that
[48:05.800 --> 48:08.480]  than I did praising the capabilities.
[48:08.480 --> 48:11.360]  Well, I mean, in some ways that's our job, right?
[48:11.360 --> 48:12.920]  Is to like go to the max.
[48:12.920 --> 48:17.200]  And then I always view it as if you write a review
[48:17.200 --> 48:18.400]  and you're critical of a feature
[48:18.400 --> 48:22.080]  or you point out the shortfalls
[48:22.080 --> 48:24.880]  of a particular innovation or feature or whatever,
[48:24.880 --> 48:26.480]  and people come in afterwards and you go,
[48:26.480 --> 48:27.400]  hey, cut us some slack.
[48:27.400 --> 48:28.760]  It's actually pretty good.
[48:28.760 --> 48:31.000]  I think that I'm at the right point.
[48:31.000 --> 48:32.920]  Like you don't want people coming in
[48:32.920 --> 48:37.520]  and going like, oh, you over-praised this thing
[48:37.520 --> 48:39.800]  that's clearly got massive flaws.
[48:39.800 --> 48:42.720]  I mean, obviously I feel comfortable
[48:42.720 --> 48:45.640]  with most of my, well, hopefully all of my reviews
[48:45.640 --> 48:48.560]  as I do feel that I evaluate things fairly,
[48:48.560 --> 48:52.400]  but I'm more comfortable if people come and say,
[48:52.400 --> 48:55.440]  hey, cut this thing some slack, and that's fine
[48:55.440 --> 48:58.440]  because that's your job is to be relatively critical
[48:58.440 --> 49:01.440]  of a thing in an equanimities sense.
[49:01.440 --> 49:04.280]  You want to be critical and fair.
[49:04.280 --> 49:07.400]  I always tell my writers skeptical, not cynical, right?
[49:07.400 --> 49:09.720]  Like, so you got to come in and say,
[49:09.720 --> 49:12.160]  hey, this is great, but you know,
[49:12.160 --> 49:14.240]  here's the thing, here's the where it falls short
[49:14.240 --> 49:17.440]  of what its goals were, right?
[49:17.440 --> 49:18.680]  And that's kind of the key.
[49:18.680 --> 49:21.440]  Cause like, I will say, I'm going to be frank
[49:21.440 --> 49:23.240]  about the quality of this macro lens.
[49:23.240 --> 49:25.960]  There's a significant amount of aberration near the edges.
[49:25.960 --> 49:28.760]  It is, it separates and blurs a lot
[49:28.760 --> 49:30.600]  near the edges of the image.
[49:30.600 --> 49:33.000]  It introduces some color and artifacting.
[49:33.000 --> 49:34.120]  And I mentioned this all in my review.
[49:34.120 --> 49:35.600]  This is not some sort of thing I'd,
[49:35.600 --> 49:37.200]  the ex post facto or whatever.
[49:37.200 --> 49:39.920]  I mentioned this in my review, but just to be clear,
[49:39.920 --> 49:44.640]  if you have a very high quality macro lens
[49:44.640 --> 49:48.320]  that has excellent optics and glass and it's well-coated
[49:48.320 --> 49:50.960]  and you're a skilled user of that lens,
[49:50.960 --> 49:54.080]  these are not comparable images between these two things.
[49:54.080 --> 49:58.640]  However, it adds what in photographic terms,
[49:58.640 --> 50:02.920]  you would call a photographic language to your repertoire.
[50:02.920 --> 50:05.560]  It's like learning a few words of French
[50:05.560 --> 50:06.760]  and going to France.
[50:06.760 --> 50:10.640]  It's just a light years difference from zero to one.
[50:10.640 --> 50:12.480]  Like you go to France and you know no French,
[50:12.480 --> 50:14.420]  you're going to get roughly the same reception
[50:14.420 --> 50:16.400]  as any other traveler going to France.
[50:16.400 --> 50:18.240]  You go to France and you know a few words of French
[50:18.240 --> 50:19.680]  and you pronounce them properly.
[50:19.680 --> 50:21.880]  It's very key to say this because the French
[50:21.880 --> 50:23.400]  are very particular about the language.
[50:23.400 --> 50:26.840]  But if you do, you get a completely different reception
[50:26.840 --> 50:31.400]  from anybody from a cab driver to a server at a restaurant,
[50:31.400 --> 50:32.920]  to a major detail hotel,
[50:32.920 --> 50:34.960]  or even just people that you meet.
[50:34.960 --> 50:39.920]  They appreciate and respect that you are trying to
[50:39.920 --> 50:43.360]  use their native language and to try to make some effort
[50:43.360 --> 50:45.600]  to understand their culture to some small degree.
[50:45.600 --> 50:48.360]  And it is a zero to one experience in travel.
[50:48.360 --> 50:50.960]  And that's what this macro lens offers people
[50:50.960 --> 50:53.200]  is a completely new language to speak
[50:53.200 --> 50:55.560]  that they would not have been able to speak otherwise.
[50:55.560 --> 50:57.400]  And it's like saying, hey, you don't know the language
[50:57.400 --> 50:58.960]  at all and you can never learn it.
[50:58.960 --> 51:01.120]  Or you've taken some language courses
[51:01.120 --> 51:06.120]  and you can order a coffee and a piece of toast
[51:06.220 --> 51:11.220]  and get a warm reception and a nice chat with somebody
[51:11.300 --> 51:12.800]  just by knowing a few words of the language.
[51:12.800 --> 51:14.160]  And that's what this does to me.
[51:14.160 --> 51:15.760]  It's not about perfection.
[51:15.760 --> 51:18.900]  It's not about best in class, or I say in class,
[51:18.900 --> 51:22.400]  but it's not about best in world experience
[51:22.400 --> 51:24.920]  with a macro lens and oh man, this is perfect.
[51:24.920 --> 51:26.520]  It's you can do this now
[51:26.520 --> 51:28.820]  when you couldn't do it before at all.
[51:28.820 --> 51:30.280]  And it's not only that,
[51:30.280 --> 51:32.520]  but it's actually pretty goddamn good
[51:32.520 --> 51:37.080]  for such a small lens, tiny, tiny bit of optic.
[51:37.080 --> 51:40.240]  And it's tucked away inside of an ultra wide,
[51:40.240 --> 51:41.560]  which is awesome.
[51:41.560 --> 51:43.880]  Just the amount of the feet that they pulled off here
[51:43.880 --> 51:45.120]  is really incredible.
[51:45.120 --> 51:47.900]  And it's not about perfection and image quality perfection,
[51:47.900 --> 51:50.640]  which is why you mention it, but don't dwell on it.
[51:50.640 --> 51:53.140]  But then you've got to acknowledge that
[51:53.140 --> 51:56.600]  it also makes things possible that weren't possible before
[51:56.600 --> 52:00.160]  for millions to hundreds of millions of people
[52:00.160 --> 52:01.160]  over the next few years,
[52:01.160 --> 52:03.440]  because the feature's not gonna go away, right?
[52:03.440 --> 52:05.220]  That they could never do before.
[52:05.220 --> 52:06.640]  And that to me is the importance.
[52:06.640 --> 52:08.200]  You have to balance those two factors.
[52:08.200 --> 52:11.040]  Hey, it's not optical perfection,
[52:11.040 --> 52:14.180]  but at the same time, it's an enabling feature
[52:14.180 --> 52:16.480]  that makes people able to do things
[52:16.480 --> 52:17.560]  they could not do before.
[52:17.560 --> 52:20.760]  And to that degree, it is like an exoskeleton
[52:20.760 --> 52:22.240]  or a superpower for a lot of people.
[52:22.240 --> 52:24.840]  And I think that part of it's cool.
[52:24.840 --> 52:27.920]  I also found out recently that in addition,
[52:27.920 --> 52:29.800]  I've known that the French are very particular
[52:29.800 --> 52:31.240]  about the pronunciation of their language.
[52:31.240 --> 52:33.120]  I didn't realize they're so persnickety
[52:33.120 --> 52:35.200]  about their submarines as well.
[52:35.200 --> 52:36.040]  But.
[52:36.040 --> 52:39.360]  Yes, yes, apparently.
[52:39.360 --> 52:42.560]  But I do, I love the analogy, I do.
[52:42.560 --> 52:44.480]  And it's like, you know, it's sort of like the thing
[52:44.480 --> 52:46.620]  where if you know enough that you can like ask for help
[52:46.620 --> 52:48.940]  getting on the Metro and going the right way
[52:48.940 --> 52:52.080]  to go somewhere, it like totally expands your trip, right?
[52:52.080 --> 52:54.600]  Because now you feel like, you know, I'm confident enough.
[52:54.600 --> 52:56.500]  I don't really, you know, I don't know it a lot,
[52:56.500 --> 52:58.320]  but I could ask somebody for help
[52:58.320 --> 53:02.020]  and get on the Metro and go elsewhere in Paris.
[53:02.020 --> 53:04.040]  It's like, instead of just staying
[53:04.040 --> 53:06.200]  within walking distance of your hotel,
[53:06.200 --> 53:08.240]  it totally expands your trip.
[53:08.240 --> 53:09.240]  I get it.
[53:09.240 --> 53:11.520]  And maybe a good analogy too is sort of like
[53:11.520 --> 53:14.060]  when the iPhone first started getting serious
[53:14.060 --> 53:16.720]  about the phone and it wasn't just an afterthought,
[53:16.720 --> 53:18.960]  which I think was like the iPhone 4
[53:18.960 --> 53:21.900]  is like the first camera that had like auto focus
[53:21.900 --> 53:25.280]  and like where Phil Schiller actually spent time
[53:25.280 --> 53:28.740]  in the introduction talking about camera features.
[53:28.740 --> 53:29.580]  Right.
[53:29.580 --> 53:31.440]  Somebody pointed out, it is hilarious,
[53:31.440 --> 53:34.380]  but with the original iPhone in 2007,
[53:34.380 --> 53:36.000]  it was like I waited in line.
[53:36.000 --> 53:37.480]  Cause you remember back then you had to wait.
[53:37.480 --> 53:38.560]  There was no way to pre-order.
[53:38.560 --> 53:40.400]  You had to like go to the Apple store and get in line.
[53:40.400 --> 53:43.200]  And I got in line and I got it in the afternoon
[53:43.200 --> 53:45.800]  and got one for the wife and we came home
[53:45.800 --> 53:50.600]  and AT&T totally took a nationwide crap out.
[53:50.600 --> 53:51.600]  Yes.
[53:51.600 --> 53:55.240]  But it was like, like the only way to get it hooked up
[53:55.240 --> 53:56.360]  is you had to open it up,
[53:56.360 --> 53:59.120]  connect it to a computer to iTunes
[53:59.120 --> 54:02.280]  and then iTunes would like authorize the phone
[54:02.280 --> 54:03.660]  and whatever you call it.
[54:03.660 --> 54:05.600]  What do you call it when the carrier activate,
[54:05.600 --> 54:10.600]  activate the phone and AT&T took a nap, you know,
[54:11.200 --> 54:13.680]  and no, no, you know, we laugh,
[54:13.680 --> 54:16.560]  but it's like, it's not really like you could expect AT&T
[54:16.560 --> 54:18.920]  to have built an activation system
[54:18.920 --> 54:22.600]  that was ready for that type of volume.
[54:22.600 --> 54:24.400]  But then, you know, got it activated
[54:24.400 --> 54:26.880]  and it was so exhilarating and super exciting.
[54:26.880 --> 54:30.120]  And we were actually going on a trip to the shore
[54:30.120 --> 54:33.180]  with Amy's family the next day.
[54:33.180 --> 54:35.580]  And, you know, it was great to have the phone already
[54:35.580 --> 54:37.120]  and I was excited to take it,
[54:37.120 --> 54:38.400]  but I wanted to write up my thoughts
[54:38.400 --> 54:41.120]  and I wrote my like 24 hour initial thoughts
[54:41.120 --> 54:44.400]  on the original iPhone and it holds up very well,
[54:44.400 --> 54:46.800]  except one thing that I didn't even mention
[54:46.800 --> 54:48.560]  is the word camera.
[54:48.560 --> 54:51.560]  Never, I didn't even mention it.
[54:51.560 --> 54:54.000]  Right, which today, if you wrote a review
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.400]  of the iPhone today and didn't mention the camera,
[54:56.400 --> 54:58.840]  people would think you had lost your marble, right?
[54:58.840 --> 55:02.000]  They're like, what, is this a review or is this a joke?
[55:02.000 --> 55:03.680]  Right, like what are you talking about?
[55:03.680 --> 55:05.240]  And which is pretty remarkable.
[55:05.240 --> 55:08.400]  I mean, you expect, it's not just an expectation
[55:08.400 --> 55:10.960]  that the iPhone's camera is decent.
[55:10.960 --> 55:13.600]  The expectation is, is this the best camera
[55:13.600 --> 55:18.600]  that you can possibly buy in a non-camera device?
[55:18.680 --> 55:20.980]  Let's call it that way, although, you know,
[55:20.980 --> 55:23.560]  there's arguments to be made that what is a camera?
[55:23.560 --> 55:25.840]  But is this the best camera you can buy or not?
[55:25.840 --> 55:27.680]  Like that's the, where we are now.
[55:27.680 --> 55:30.840]  It's not, is it decent, is it good, is it improved?
[55:30.840 --> 55:33.000]  It's literally, is this the best in the world or not?
[55:33.000 --> 55:36.120]  And the answer is usually leapfrogging from day to day.
[55:36.120 --> 55:38.680]  Now I have my own arguments as everybody does
[55:38.680 --> 55:40.840]  about, you know, other smartphone approaches
[55:40.840 --> 55:43.040]  and all of this stuff and what they choose to do
[55:43.040 --> 55:47.320]  and realism versus, you know, illustrative quality
[55:47.320 --> 55:49.100]  to photos and all of this stuff.
[55:49.100 --> 55:51.560]  But really it is a matter of either it is
[55:51.560 --> 55:54.080]  or it isn't the best camera in the world, period.
[55:54.080 --> 55:57.040]  And that's crazy to think about when you realize
[55:57.040 --> 55:59.920]  the fact that it does all this other stuff, right?
[55:59.920 --> 56:01.560]  Like it's a phone, it's not a camera,
[56:01.560 --> 56:03.800]  it does a bunch of other things.
[56:03.800 --> 56:06.700]  But the only conversation we're willing to have about it
[56:06.700 --> 56:08.500]  is, is it the best in the world or not?
[56:08.500 --> 56:10.840]  And that's pretty remarkable a few years on.
[56:10.840 --> 56:14.920]  And it's the other thing with macro that really impresses me
[56:14.920 --> 56:16.120]  and I did mention this.
[56:16.120 --> 56:19.000]  So the iPhone has long had a magnifier feature.
[56:19.000 --> 56:22.040]  There's an app and I have it set for a triple click
[56:22.040 --> 56:25.520]  on the home button where it just jumps to magnifier
[56:25.520 --> 56:28.320]  and you can use it as like a magnifying glass as you go.
[56:28.320 --> 56:31.220]  But the magnifier only uses like the 1X lens
[56:31.220 --> 56:34.200]  and digital zoom and it's very, very shaky.
[56:34.200 --> 56:37.280]  And the thing I noticed is that if you just wanna see
[56:37.280 --> 56:40.140]  something small, too small for your aging eyes
[56:40.140 --> 56:42.260]  or even if you're young, just super small
[56:42.260 --> 56:43.800]  that you just can't see, right?
[56:43.800 --> 56:45.760]  Switching to macro mode on your phone,
[56:45.760 --> 56:47.140]  even if you don't wanna take a picture of it,
[56:47.140 --> 56:49.240]  if it's just like small print on something
[56:49.240 --> 56:51.520]  and you just wanna read it or look close at it,
[56:51.520 --> 56:53.560]  macro mode with the iPhone is way better
[56:53.560 --> 56:54.800]  than the magnifier app now.
[56:54.800 --> 56:57.160]  I can only presume that maybe one hand
[56:57.160 --> 56:58.200]  wasn't talking to the other.
[56:58.200 --> 57:00.480]  We all know how Apple was compartmentalized
[57:00.480 --> 57:03.360]  and the magnifier team probably wasn't briefed
[57:03.360 --> 57:04.800]  on the new iPhone hardware.
[57:04.800 --> 57:06.440]  And I can only presume that the magnifier
[57:06.440 --> 57:08.800]  is gonna be updated to take advantage of this.
[57:08.800 --> 57:13.360]  But like, you know, just like imagine something silly,
[57:13.360 --> 57:15.080]  like you're a parent and your kid thinks
[57:15.080 --> 57:17.560]  they might have a splinter in their finger
[57:17.560 --> 57:20.480]  and it's like, I don't know, I don't see anything,
[57:20.480 --> 57:21.880]  but it's like if you really wanna know,
[57:21.880 --> 57:24.360]  you could like use your camera in macro mode
[57:24.360 --> 57:25.760]  and you'll find it, right?
[57:25.760 --> 57:26.600]  Like you'll see it.
[57:26.600 --> 57:29.400]  It is, and it's stabilized, right?
[57:29.400 --> 57:31.240]  It's like there's, I don't know if it's the sensor shift.
[57:31.240 --> 57:32.300]  I don't know if it's digital.
[57:32.300 --> 57:33.920]  I don't know if they're doing it,
[57:33.920 --> 57:35.700]  because obviously it's a crop, right?
[57:35.700 --> 57:39.200]  You're getting this 1X crop,
[57:39.200 --> 57:42.560]  but from the ultra-wide 0.5X sensor.
[57:42.560 --> 57:45.400]  So they have, for lack of a better word,
[57:45.400 --> 57:47.120]  slop to move it around digitally.
[57:47.120 --> 57:48.320]  They call it over scan.
[57:48.320 --> 57:50.040]  Over scan, right. Exactly.
[57:50.040 --> 57:53.080]  Right, but it's way more stable than the magnifier is.
[57:53.080 --> 57:55.000]  The magnifier, you kinda have to brace yourself
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.080]  if you really wanna zoom in to the maximum degree.
[57:57.080 --> 57:59.480]  If you really just wanna like look real closely
[57:59.480 --> 58:01.240]  at a kid's finger and see if you can see
[58:01.240 --> 58:04.440]  a splinter in there, it's fantastic.
[58:04.440 --> 58:06.080]  And like it's a superpower.
[58:06.080 --> 58:09.200]  Like all of a sudden now you can like easily see
[58:09.200 --> 58:11.360]  like the details of fingerprint and see,
[58:11.360 --> 58:12.520]  no, you don't have a splinter.
[58:12.520 --> 58:14.280]  Go toughen up.
[58:14.280 --> 58:15.400]  Or, oh yeah, you do.
[58:15.400 --> 58:17.360]  Here, let me see if I can get this out.
[58:18.560 --> 58:22.320]  Yeah, it's gonna enable a lot of fun, cool stuff like that
[58:22.320 --> 58:24.840]  that is not necessarily just macro photography.
[58:24.840 --> 58:26.520]  And that's what happens every time Apple
[58:26.520 --> 58:28.020]  introduces a new piece of hardware
[58:28.020 --> 58:31.000]  or significantly enhances a previous one,
[58:31.000 --> 58:33.400]  is that there's tons of ways to take advantage of that
[58:33.400 --> 58:34.960]  from a developer perspective.
[58:34.960 --> 58:37.160]  We often see like game developers
[58:37.160 --> 58:39.500]  and people that make interactive experiences
[58:39.500 --> 58:42.280]  take advantage of sensors and things in,
[58:42.280 --> 58:43.920]  you know, unexpected ways.
[58:43.920 --> 58:47.480]  But the right now, what you've got is a focusing range
[58:47.480 --> 58:52.440]  from two millimeters to infinity, which is pretty awesome.
[58:52.440 --> 58:54.200]  You know, when you think about the range
[58:54.200 --> 58:56.880]  of sensing capabilities that you have,
[58:56.880 --> 58:58.120]  because when you just think of the iPhone
[58:58.120 --> 59:01.260]  as a bundle of sensors, it's a matter of what can it see,
[59:01.260 --> 59:04.120]  what can it not see, what information can it
[59:04.120 --> 59:08.680]  realistically interpret well, and at what resolution?
[59:08.680 --> 59:10.680]  So in other words, what can it enable, right?
[59:10.680 --> 59:12.280]  What features can it enable?
[59:12.280 --> 59:13.560]  What things can I do with it?
[59:13.560 --> 59:14.880]  And that's what this does.
[59:14.880 --> 59:16.260]  It's a platform.
[59:16.260 --> 59:18.500]  You know, every camera that Apple builds
[59:18.500 --> 59:22.240]  and puts on their devices is more than just a camera
[59:22.240 --> 59:24.440]  for taking photos, it is a platform.
[59:24.440 --> 59:26.980]  And we've seen companies like Snap and Facebook
[59:26.980 --> 59:30.700]  and other companies build out enormous businesses
[59:30.700 --> 59:33.840]  and will continue to, you know, in significant,
[59:33.840 --> 59:36.580]  to significant scale and significant size
[59:36.580 --> 59:38.280]  with the camera as a platform.
[59:38.280 --> 59:40.060]  It's not the phone that's the platform.
[59:40.060 --> 59:42.940]  The phone houses, you know, the camera
[59:42.940 --> 59:45.280]  and how in the software, obviously it has a play,
[59:45.280 --> 59:47.240]  but the camera itself is the platform.
[59:47.240 --> 59:48.780]  And that's pretty awesome.
[59:48.780 --> 59:51.360]  So anytime, you know, they add camera stuff,
[59:51.360 --> 59:53.700]  it's not just, oh, do you care about photography?
[59:53.700 --> 59:56.600]  Then this is important to talk about and analyze.
[59:56.600 --> 01:00:00.640]  It's, hey, you know, anybody that builds anything
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.080]  can really take advantage of these
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:04.160]  as a platform to build on.
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.240]  And that's, that's what's exciting about this stuff.
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.000]  And the fact is like, no matter how much I complain
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.320]  about the image quality of the macro,
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:12.520]  it's still really good, like for the size that it is,
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:15.420]  especially the central portion of the image,
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:19.520]  quite sharp, very, you know, very accurate
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:22.880]  in terms of, trust me, I've used a lot of macro lenses
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.400]  and some of them are quite crappy
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.640]  and they were built for cameras, you know?
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.520]  And this is the equivalent, I think,
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.500]  of a several hundred dollar macro lens.
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.400]  I really do.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:35.600]  Like, you know, if you get into the 1200 to $2,000 range,
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.960]  sure, the glass starts getting really good
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:41.200]  and, you know, aberration calms down and all of that stuff.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.760]  But in terms of buying one off the shelf,
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.000]  you'd have to spend several hundred dollars
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.040]  to get this kind of capability
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:49.360]  just for your regular four thirds camera or SLR.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:52.300]  So I think it's a really, really nice,
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:53.380]  I hesitate to use the word
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:55.000]  because, you know, people get all irritated about it,
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.360]  but I really do think it is a nice gift, you know,
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.560]  to people on the iPhone.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:01.480]  Like, you buy the iPhone for all of the other reasons
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.960]  and congratulations, you got this cool shit too.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.120]  In my mind, that's the way I look at it.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.800]  It's very cool to me too
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:10.460]  that it is a feature of all of the ultra wides.
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:12.080]  It's not, I think, right?
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.360]  Or no, I'm wrong, it's not, it's pro.
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.480]  It is pro only, I take it back.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.320]  Right.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.160]  No, it is pro only.
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.760]  Cinematic mode is a feature of all the cameras,
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.400]  but the macro is pro only.
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:23.220]  No, but that does lead me to my point.
[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:24.900]  My point actually, it would be nice
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:27.320]  and I guess eventually it probably will trickle down
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.180]  because that's the way it goes,
[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:30.120]  but it actually does lead me to my point though,
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.680]  which is that this,
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:35.200]  there's the battery life advantage to the pro models
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:40.200]  and now significant camera differences.
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.880]  So the entire existence of the telephoto lens
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:46.880]  is a pro feature.
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:51.480]  And now the ultra wide has this macro capability.
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:54.560]  And to me, it is very, very nice
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.260]  that the extra 200 bucks or so
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:02.460]  that you pay to go from a 13 to a 13 pro
[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:06.680]  is not just about the superficial bling
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:11.160]  of the shiny stainless steel instead of the matte aluminum.
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:14.200]  There was a time when they first started separating these,
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:17.040]  you know, to multiple new iPhones per year
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:19.000]  based with the same A series chip.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.880]  So there's a certain technical underlying similarity,
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.620]  but there was a sort of,
[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:26.460]  look, you're just paying for the bling of the steel
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:28.400]  and the shininess and the better textures
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:31.040]  and finish and OLED instead of LCD.
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:35.960]  To me, it is easily $200 worth of camera alone
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.720]  difference between the 13 and 13 pro.
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:41.120]  And it's nice for both reasons.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:44.280]  If you care about having these camera features,
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.240]  it's a no brainer to spend the 200 bucks.
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.300]  And conversely, if you are,
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:52.040]  and there are, because there's a billion iPhone users,
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:54.600]  so there's like hundreds of millions of iPhone users
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.880]  who qualify for any description,
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.720]  but if you're one of the hundreds of millions
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:02.200]  of iPhone users who really doesn't care about the camera,
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.360]  you know, there's hundreds of millions of iPhone users
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:05.800]  who barely use the camera.
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:08.520]  Now you don't have to pay to it.
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:11.600]  You can get like the latest and greatest A15,
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.120]  all of these efficiency advantages from it.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:16.560]  And you don't have to spend the extra money
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.260]  for a camera you're not gonna use.
[01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:23.260]  I think that's actually the product strategy
[01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:29.340]  is working out to me in a way that makes decisions
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:31.460]  very easy for people to make.
[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:34.660]  Yes, this is a very well segmented lineup, right?
[01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:39.660]  And that is a boon to consumers making decisions
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:41.320]  based on budget.
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:44.380]  And it is going to, as I was mentioning before,
[01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:47.180]  I think it's going to really help sales
[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:50.300]  because one of the traditional problems,
[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:52.300]  and I think a lot of us were talking about this
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:55.180]  a few years back, is that the iPhone left
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:57.780]  a relatively large pricing umbrella, right?
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:58.620]  And that's one of the reasons
[01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:02.020]  why they started keeping old models around longer
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:05.180]  is to underfill that pricing umbrella.
[01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:08.080]  But what this does is it really bolsters their ability
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:11.220]  to offer a wall of options for people
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:15.960]  that leave very few openings for somebody to go like,
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:18.860]  hey, I would buy that, but it's so expensive
[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:20.620]  I'll just buy this Android instead.
[01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:23.340]  Because people do still make those kinds of decisions
[01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:25.460]  regardless of what you want to talk about with lock-in.
[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.260]  They do still make those decisions.
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:30.140]  Less and less, obviously over time,
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:31.700]  but I think that's still a risk.
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:33.140]  And so now what they're able to offer
[01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:34.780]  is a very solid wall of options
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:37.380]  with very little umbrella to creep under
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:40.140]  and very few gaps to shoot through
[01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:41.860]  because people are able to make a call and say,
[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:44.620]  look, I get this amazing,
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:47.500]  these features that I really want and this sounds awesome.
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:48.740]  I would really love to play around
[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:50.940]  with feature X or feature Y.
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:52.780]  And I can spend less now
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:55.820]  because I don't care about feature X or feature Z.
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:57.860]  To me, the big hole in the pricing,
[01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:00.300]  and I know the rumors say that this,
[01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:02.520]  that what I'm about to say is coming next year.
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:03.360]  Who knows?
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:05.080]  I don't want to spend time on rumors of iPhone 14,
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.740]  but the big hole in the lineup would be,
[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:11.700]  I want a ginormous 6.7 inch phone,
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.860]  but I don't want to spend $1,100.
[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:18.220]  I want to spend $600 or $700 or 800.
[01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:22.620]  There is no non-pro max sized phone.
[01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:24.980]  And supposedly that's coming next year
[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:27.620]  at the expense of dropping the mini from the lineup.
[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:29.660]  And there's also no mini pro,
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:33.060]  but I feel like the mini pro is even more,
[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:35.060]  it's like a niche within the niche.
[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:36.860]  The one that would, to me,
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:39.620]  would sell like hotcakes would be
[01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:42.940]  the giant sized iPhone, not pro.
[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:46.700]  But you kind of see why they don't have it,
[01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:49.540]  because if you really want that size
[01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:51.220]  and you have to start at 1,100 bucks,
[01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:52.600]  well, you know, there it is.
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.780]  But I can also see why they're adding it.
[01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:55.860]  I know what I was confused by.
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:58.420]  I knew there was one more very cool feature
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:01.860]  that I think they could have made pro only,
[01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:04.740]  but didn't, and it's photo styles.
[01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:07.420]  That's what I was thinking of when I was thinking of macro.
[01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:09.140]  Macro is driven by hardware,
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:12.180]  that hardware is literally only in the pro.
[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:15.540]  Photo styles, though, is a neat feature.
[01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:19.860]  And I've been playing with that more in the last week, too.
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:21.740]  And I'm curious what you think about that,
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:24.100]  and I'm curious what your settings are for it.
[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:27.980]  Yeah, so you're talking about
[01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:29.980]  why it's not available on the non-pro?
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:32.060]  No, photo styles is on the non-pro.
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:33.020]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:37.460]  Yeah, this is the feature that Apple went out of its way
[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.100]  to say, this is not a filter.
[01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:42.060]  What it is, I think a good layperson's description,
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:44.980]  and I'm sort of riffing on John Siracusa's description
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:47.060]  from ATP last week, but basically,
[01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:49.060]  everybody knows that the different camera makers
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:51.100]  have different sort of looks, right?
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:54.780]  Like there's like the Apple look to photo development,
[01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:58.980]  and iPhone cameras all sort of, without any filtering,
[01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:01.340]  sort of have a certain color look,
[01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:04.260]  and Samsungs are more vibrant,
[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:08.020]  and pixels are different in other ways.
[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:09.340]  You know, like you take the same two,
[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:10.180]  and you could say these are,
[01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:13.060]  like the Pixel and the iPhone are both excellent cameras,
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:16.260]  and the Samsung Galaxy latest is also an excellent camera,
[01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:18.180]  and set them all up in the same scene
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:20.380]  with the same sunlight, and you kind of get,
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:21.660]  you know, you get different greens,
[01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:23.700]  and you get different skin tones, and et cetera,
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:26.740]  and so forth, and it's not filters.
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:30.540]  It's just a way of taking, you know, the inherent,
[01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:32.100]  like if you just took the RAW,
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:34.780]  and if you do shoot RAW using Halite or something,
[01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:36.780]  you see that the image off these sensors
[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:41.100]  is awful and unusable and needs to be post-processed.
[01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:44.220]  Yes, all images off of smartphones are post-processed.
[01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:45.580]  Big, big time, right?
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:48.420]  There's just no way to get that kind of image
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:51.620]  without a lot of work behind the scenes
[01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:54.580]  to correct lens problems, right?
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:57.500]  To correct inherent issues in the optics,
[01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:59.900]  and then also now, especially with iPhones,
[01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:04.140]  to blend images, pixels, whatever you want to call it,
[01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:07.860]  from several cameras and several exposures together
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:11.380]  to rectify problems in the sensor, right?
[01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:13.220]  So really, all this post-processing
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:16.540]  is improving the quality of the image
[01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:19.300]  by correcting issues with lens and sensor, right?
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:20.620]  Like, that's really what it boils down to,
[01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:22.900]  because the sensor's just tiny, and so is the lens,
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:25.340]  and that introduces a lot of image artifacts,
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:27.220]  and all of the post-processing is there
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:29.660]  to correct those artifacts.
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:32.700]  So when you do post-process,
[01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:36.540]  I think there's two analogies that are apt here.
[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:37.980]  One is film, right?
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:39.860]  Like, what kind of film were you going to choose
[01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:41.820]  to shoot with your film camera?
[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:44.220]  And that's really what photo styles is about,
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.380]  photographic styles.
[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:47.940]  And then another one is sort of shooting quality,
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:49.100]  and that's a little bit harder,
[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:52.820]  and in all reality, like, digital cameras
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:57.820]  from Nikon and Canon and Minolta early on,
[01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:01.220]  they all had this sort of native approach
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.820]  to how they color-corrected
[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:05.380]  and color-balanced their sensors,
[01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:07.740]  and for a while, it's a little different now,
[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:09.660]  because I think everybody's gotten so good at it,
[01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:11.500]  but for a while, you could absolutely tell
[01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.140]  what kind of body you were shooting,
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:16.140]  just by looking at the processing, JPEG processing,
[01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:18.500]  that one camera would do or another would do.
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:19.700]  You could tell, like, oh, look,
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:21.180]  it's slightly more contrasty,
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:23.020]  so that's, like, Nikon's approach right now,
[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:25.900]  or, you know, it's slightly punchier in saturation,
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:28.300]  especially in the red, so that's Canon's approach right now.
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:30.860]  This was a thing you could tell early on.
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:33.260]  Nowadays, it's much more sophisticated, you know,
[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:35.140]  as everybody's gotten better at this,
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:36.340]  but you could tell that.
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:38.220]  So there's kind of two things going on,
[01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:41.380]  and one, that underlying processing
[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:44.140]  just provides a basic, you know, image
[01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:47.700]  to somebody shooting a picture in JPEG is a choice.
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:50.380]  That's a decision that the camera teams
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:54.540]  at these companies make, and it is an editorial call.
[01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:55.540]  You are sort of saying,
[01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:57.740]  this is how we want our pictures to look,
[01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:59.860]  and as you said, if you shoot Halide
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:03.140]  or some other camera where you can pull a raw image,
[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:06.820]  you could see what the no choices means, right?
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:10.220]  If you make no choices, you get this really rough image,
[01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:12.300]  so you have to make some decisions
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.380]  about the way your images look,
[01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:17.380]  and so each company, whether it be Samsung or Apple
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:21.060]  or Google or whoever, makes a decision
[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:22.980]  about the way their images are going to look,
[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:25.980]  and they make that decision based on a variety of factors,
[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:27.980]  but the large portion of those factors
[01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:30.580]  is what do we think customers are gonna like, right?
[01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:32.300]  What do we think people are going to like,
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:34.460]  and how should these images look
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:36.860]  to make them the most happy about their pictures
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:38.180]  when they use this phone?
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:40.500]  And so Apple's decision-making on that front
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:44.340]  has always been to hew towards the neutral,
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:47.660]  so more of a reality-based take
[01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.300]  versus a lot of other companies that say,
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:51.660]  hey, we know reality exists,
[01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:55.820]  but our customers tend to like images that are punchier,
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:58.500]  both in saturation and in contrast,
[01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:01.700]  so you'll find the images from companies like Samsung
[01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:03.820]  or Google or other companies,
[01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:06.300]  they have made a different editorial call.
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:08.060]  I am not here to pass judgment
[01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:09.700]  on any of those editorial calls.
[01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:12.460]  I have my own preferences, as I'm sure other people do,
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:15.340]  and that's okay, but Apple's call has always been
[01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:17.660]  neutral, neutral, neutral.
[01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:19.700]  That's their rallying cry.
[01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:21.940]  They want things to look naturalistic
[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:23.780]  and neutral as much as possible
[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:27.140]  versus, say, pleasing on a digital screen
[01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:28.700]  versus pleasing in print.
[01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:31.460]  Like, there's so many calls you could make, right?
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:34.700]  And that is, like, that's a huge call they've had to make,
[01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:38.900]  and so photographic styles is their concession
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:42.900]  to people that do not like Apple's choices,
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:46.300]  and the difference between them and a filter
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:48.460]  is that they are applied in situ
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:50.100]  as the people are taking the pictures
[01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:54.500]  and woven in to the files that allow the phone
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.260]  to render those images,
[01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:59.100]  which means that you can alter them afterwards,
[01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:02.700]  but they are part of the processing pipeline,
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:04.980]  allowing you to get a natural-looking image
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:06.500]  according to your tastes
[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:10.900]  without applying a filter to the already rendered pixels,
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:12.860]  and that creates a situation
[01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:15.940]  where you have the best possible image quality
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:18.620]  while adding customization,
[01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:20.500]  and this would be in film photography
[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:22.820]  akin to choosing your own roll of film
[01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:25.300]  or style of film that you wanted.
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:26.540]  What a great description.
[01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:28.860]  Right now, when you go to adjust these,
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:31.620]  they have a couple of presets that you can choose from.
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:35.420]  I think it's like rich contrast,
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:39.580]  contrast vibrant, warm, and cool,
[01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:41.100]  and then you can take any of them.
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:43.660]  Like, so, for example, warm,
[01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:45.620]  and there's only two settings with each one.
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:47.220]  One they call tone,
[01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:49.580]  which I think is mostly about contrast,
[01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:50.740]  and then there's warmth,
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:53.260]  which I think most people, even casual photographers,
[01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:54.620]  kind of know it's, you know,
[01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:59.620]  you go redder and oranger and warmer or bluer and cooler.
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:04.820]  Like warm is zero tone, 50 warmth,
[01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:06.300]  but that's the only two factors.
[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:07.260]  There's two factors,
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:08.700]  and you can adjust them if you want.
[01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:10.700]  So you can take one of these,
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:12.580]  and then, of course, there's standard,
[01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:14.620]  which is just, this is, you know,
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:17.900]  the regular Apple pipeline that we've come to know
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:20.020]  and love or not love.
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:22.580]  So you can take any of these and adjust them.
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:23.820]  So you could take contrast,
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:26.780]  which I think is like negative 50 tones or a warmth,
[01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:29.300]  and I turned it up a little bit more to,
[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:30.700]  that's the one I've been shooting with,
[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:33.300]  where I've taken my tone to negative 65,
[01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:34.940]  and my warmth is still at zero.
[01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:38.460]  I'm curious if you've adjusted yours
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:39.900]  or are you still shooting standard
[01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:41.780]  or what are you shooting?
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:46.260]  Yeah, I mean, the fact is I kinda like Apple's general tone.
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:47.340]  I like the neutral tone,
[01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:49.900]  so I don't know if I'm going to do one.
[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:52.140]  I haven't done a personal one yet, right?
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:54.740]  So I haven't like developed my own yet, for sure.
[01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:57.420]  I've been shooting everything mostly on neutral.
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:59.300]  I think that the boosted contrast,
[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:01.380]  which I believe is vibrant?
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:02.700]  Yeah, no, I think the-
[01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:04.340]  Yes, no.
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:05.460]  They have an increased contrast one.
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:06.700]  I always forget what the names are.
[01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:09.460]  That's the one I've done.
[01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:11.060]  I forget what they call it, though, here.
[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:12.780]  I'll reset.
[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:14.980]  Oh, they call it rich contrast, okay.
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:15.820]  Rich contrast.
[01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:18.500]  Okay, so the rich contrast one is very pleasing,
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:20.500]  obviously, in casual look,
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:25.140]  but I think it blocks up the blacks a little too much,
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:27.300]  clips a little too much of the black for my tastes,
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:28.620]  and I know why it's there
[01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:31.620]  and why I think a lot of people are gonna use it by default
[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:33.060]  because it is punchier
[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:35.500]  and more contrast is inherently more pleasing
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:36.460]  to the human eye.
[01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:37.660]  It really is.
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:40.340]  And so I think that that will be a very popular setting,
[01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:42.460]  but I also like the fact
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:44.620]  that they do have the negative 100
[01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:47.900]  to positive 100 scale there
[01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:50.140]  because that allows people,
[01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:51.700]  and the slider,
[01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:53.220]  because it allows people to kind of come up
[01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:55.020]  with their own style and then share it.
[01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:57.180]  You can just screenshot it and share it with somebody else
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:14:58.500]  and be like, try this.
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:14:59.340]  This is mine.
[01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:00.380]  This is what I really like.
[01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:01.940]  And somebody's like, oh, I like that.
[01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:06.940]  And it's kind of like Lightroom's presets, right?
[01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:09.380]  And people have made entire businesses
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:11.740]  off of developing Lightroom presets
[01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:14.220]  that they distribute and sell to people.
[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:15.820]  And people love them.
[01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:18.980]  They give you a kind of like starting point
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:21.140]  or a look that you can export.
[01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:22.740]  And I think that having those numbers on there
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:23.740]  is really cool
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:25.420]  because it lets people set their own,
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:27.140]  make their own choices,
[01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:29.140]  and then tell somebody, oh, try this one.
[01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:34.060]  The one thing I wish they had was a specific custom option,
[01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:35.580]  which they don't have right now.
[01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:39.100]  It's just cool, warm, vibrant, rich, contrast, and standard.
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:40.700]  This should be like a user one.
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:41.540]  You know, by default.
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:43.380]  Because right now you have to change one of them.
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:45.980]  No, no, you can't change any of them, which is great,
[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:48.740]  but you can't like sort of save one as your own
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:51.020]  and leave the other ones alone, right?
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:52.900]  Pick one you don't like and then adjust it.
[01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:55.180]  Right, and then you lose their standard,
[01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:56.860]  although they have a little reset button
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:59.180]  that you can double tap to go back.
[01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:00.180]  It's not the end of the world.
[01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:01.020]  You can reset it.
[01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:03.500]  And I just think that if you're gonna offer
[01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:06.500]  the ability to build user settings in,
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:08.860]  you should add a user option,
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:11.300]  which I would guess would come at some point.
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:13.220]  It's just a matter of how long it's gonna take.
[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:16.300]  But I think that that is the one little missing thing.
[01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:18.820]  But I love the fact that you can now,
[01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:21.620]  somebody who say comes from the Samsung world,
[01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:23.460]  like comes from an Android phone
[01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:26.180]  and really loves their take on it.
[01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:27.660]  Now you can get much closer to that
[01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:30.100]  and you don't have to do post-processing.
[01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:31.980]  You can get it right in the image pipeline,
[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:34.420]  which means that when you do export that JPEG,
[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:35.380]  and most people don't know this,
[01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:39.500]  but anytime you share an image anywhere outside of iOS,
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.260]  it renders that image, right?
[01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:42.100]  That's what it does.
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:44.220]  It applies any color adjustments
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:46.660]  and things that you have set to it,
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:48.620]  and then renders it for the outside world,
[01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:50.540]  outside of Apple's ecosystem.
[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:53.820]  And if you are able to set up
[01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:56.700]  something that feels more comfortable and pleasing to you,
[01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:58.020]  why not, right?
[01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:00.180]  Like, you know, the editorial decision is great
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:01.020]  and I get it.
[01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:03.580]  I understand why Apple has leaned into that for so long,
[01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:05.700]  because they want to make sure to, you know,
[01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:08.540]  kind of present as close to what they can determine
[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:11.300]  as the truth to people for their images.
[01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:13.260]  But I don't think there's any harm in allowing people
[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:16.860]  to develop and own their own photographic styles
[01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:17.940]  and I'm glad it exists now.
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:18.780]  It's cool.
[01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:19.620]  Yeah.
[01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:21.260]  Austin Mann's custom settings.
[01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:22.700]  Now he admits like for his,
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:24.740]  like this super review on the Tanzanian thing,
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:27.860]  he shoots raw with halide and then develops them
[01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:29.180]  and you know, because he's a pro
[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:31.780]  and he's using the iPhone as a pro camera,
[01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:35.020]  but he also acknowledges that as a regular person,
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:37.180]  sometimes he just takes his phone out and shoots something
[01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:40.140]  and he just wants it, you know, he'll just shoot JPEG.
[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:44.140]  So his style, his custom style, if you wanted to name,
[01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:48.100]  if you could save a named Austin Mann photographic style,
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:50.180]  it would be negative 30 tone.
[01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:51.180]  And even though it's negative,
[01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:54.300]  that actually means a little bit more contrasty
[01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:56.500]  and plus 15 warmth.
[01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:58.420]  That's the Austin Mann style.
[01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:00.260]  And so I'm gonna switch mine to that.
[01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:02.540]  I agree you should be able to save one,
[01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:04.700]  even if it was just one spot, right?
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:06.300]  Like if it was just one called custom.
[01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:08.340]  Yeah, just one slot, right.
[01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:09.180]  But I do think-
[01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:11.020]  And eventually it should go beyond that.
[01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:12.860]  They should be able to export them, share them.
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:14.700]  Yeah, yeah, and then you could import them.
[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:15.900]  The thing that would be cool,
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.780]  and I think I can't help but believe,
[01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:18.860]  I don't wanna do it myself
[01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:20.140]  because I don't wanna bother these phones,
[01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:21.060]  but it would be cool like,
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:23.380]  let's say like everybody's much anticipating
[01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:24.580]  sometime in the next few weeks
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:27.860]  Google's gonna come out with the Pixel 6.
[01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:32.860]  And a lot of people love the Pixel look and pixels.
[01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:35.620]  Almost everybody agrees that the very best thing
[01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:37.300]  about Google's Pixel phones,
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:40.020]  number one is that they're quote unquote, pure Android.
[01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:42.620]  And number two, people love the cameras.
[01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:46.260]  They do shoot excellent, excellent phone, at least still.
[01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:48.660]  And maybe the video has been lagging in recent years.
[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:49.780]  We'll see if they catch up.
[01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:52.300]  But anyway, let's say you love the Pixel look.
[01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:54.100]  Could somebody figure out like,
[01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:58.100]  what should you set your iPhone to get a Pixel look
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:18:59.540]  out of your iPhone
[01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:02.140]  in terms of how it processes the sensor image?
[01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:04.500]  I think that sort of thing is somebody's gotta run a,
[01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:08.180]  set up a website that publishes numbers like that.
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:09.020]  I think it'd be pretty cool.
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:12.620]  Right, yeah, four options are good, you know?
[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:13.820]  Yeah, and also-
[01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:16.100]  If you're not gonna have any, go neutral.
[01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:16.980]  That's my opinion.
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:18.700]  But once you're gonna have them, that's great.
[01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:21.060]  And it's, one of the other cool things about it
[01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:23.060]  is if you don't give two shits about any of this
[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:26.540]  and this whole last 10 minutes of the show is like,
[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:27.580]  I don't care about that.
[01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:28.420]  Guess what?
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:29.260]  You don't have to worry about it.
[01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:31.180]  It's just gonna shoot standard iPhone processing,
[01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:34.740]  which, you know, iPhone is generally pretty well-regarded
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:37.740]  as a phone camera that you don't have to do a damn thing.
[01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:39.100]  And it'll never get in your way,
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:41.700]  and you never have to pick it, and it doesn't, you know.
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:45.940]  Yeah, it's the equivalent of the I'm feeling lucky button
[01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:49.620]  on Google, you know, is just give me some results.
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:50.660]  And I think it's good.
[01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:52.420]  You know, it's important to have that.
[01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:54.020]  And the fact of the matter is the team
[01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:57.860]  has a proven track record of producing pretty great images.
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:00.620]  So by default, you're getting a great image.
[01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:02.180]  And then by not default,
[01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:05.340]  by Sony wants to play with it or play around with it more,
[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:07.020]  now you're offered more options
[01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:09.340]  in getting the kind of image that really appeals to you
[01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:10.700]  and makes you excited.
[01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:11.700]  All right, let me thank our third
[01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:12.700]  and final sponsor of the show.
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:14.780]  It's our good friends at LinkedIn.
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:17.900]  Today, many small business owners are busier than ever.
[01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:20.620]  Time spent searching for and interviewing candidates
[01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:24.020]  can take time away from managing and growing a business.
[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:25.500]  If you've ever had to hire anybody,
[01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:28.020]  you know it is one of those things
[01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:31.940]  that is so much more time consuming than you ever thought,
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:33.020]  even if you went into it
[01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:34.900]  thinking it was gonna be time consuming.
[01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:37.940]  That's why LinkedIn Jobs has made it easier
[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:41.540]  to get the candidates worth interviewing faster.
[01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:43.900]  And it's free.
[01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:47.500]  You can create a free job post in minutes on LinkedIn Jobs
[01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:49.460]  to reach your network and beyond
[01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:51.380]  to the world's largest professional network
[01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:54.900]  of over 770 million people.
[01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:56.020]  That is correct.
[01:20:56.020 --> 01:21:00.460]  The LinkedIn Jobs network reaches 770 million people.
[01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:03.540]  Focus on candidates with the skills and experience
[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:05.660]  you need for your positions.
[01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:07.860]  You can use screening questions to get your role
[01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:10.380]  in front of only the most qualified people.
[01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:12.540]  Then use the simple tools on LinkedIn Jobs
[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:14.300]  to quickly filter and prioritize
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:16.580]  who you'd like to interview and hire.
[01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:19.580]  LinkedIn Jobs helps you find the candidates worth
[01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:21.100]  interviewing faster.
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:22.500]  Did you know that every week
[01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:26.980]  440 million job seekers visit LinkedIn?
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:31.980]  Post your job for free at LinkedIn.com slash talk, T-A-L-K.
[01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:35.340]  That's LinkedIn.com slash talk.
[01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:36.820]  Post your job for free.
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:38.780]  Terms and conditions apply.
[01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:42.980]  Last but not least for the show is,
[01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:45.140]  and maybe last and most interesting,
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:46.980]  cinematic mode video.
[01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:53.180]  Which I told, I don't think I was dismissive
[01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:57.180]  when I called it a, my summary of it on my review
[01:21:57.180 --> 01:21:58.540]  was look, it's a gimmick,
[01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:02.740]  but I don't mean that pejoratively gimmicks can be good.
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:07.740]  And then I saw your stuff and I saw some other stuff
[01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:13.460]  and I started thinking, hmm, maybe it's not even a gimmick.
[01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:17.220]  It is weird and it's got some technical glitches,
[01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:22.020]  but I don't know, I'm starting to think this is useful.
[01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:27.020]  And then I saw Andre Laro's short film, Float,
[01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:30.860]  which I linked on Daring Fireball last week,
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:33.220]  which is just a few minutes long
[01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:36.500]  and it's his directorial debut.
[01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:38.100]  I think he was at Adobe for a while.
[01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:39.540]  He obviously knows how to shoot photos,
[01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:42.340]  but it's, you know, if you're listening to this,
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:44.860]  I hope that you saw my post on Daring Fireball
[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:49.860]  and watched his movie, which he shot in cinematic mode.
[01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:53.980]  And even if you go into it thinking, okay, you know,
[01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:55.580]  Gruber says this is a good movie to watch
[01:22:55.580 --> 01:23:00.100]  to see cinematic mode in action, 10 seconds in,
[01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:03.420]  you will forget about looking for anything like fringes
[01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:06.500]  or focus lengths or anything, and you'll just be absorbed.
[01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:09.620]  And then a minute in, you're gonna be holding back tears
[01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:13.100]  and choking up and your heart is gonna, you know,
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:15.580]  be pounding in your chest and that's art, right?
[01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:17.820]  That's why you make movies.
[01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:19.900]  And then you're at the end and you're like, oh wait,
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:21.820]  that was, I mean, go back and start looking
[01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:23.260]  at the cinematic mode and it's like,
[01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:24.900]  and then all of a sudden you're watching it again
[01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:26.980]  and it's like, hey, this is no gimmick.
[01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:28.860]  This shit's for real.
[01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:30.980]  I don't know, that blew me away.
[01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:34.460]  I'm curious, you know, and you had a whole piece,
[01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:36.020]  you had a whole feature, you had an interview
[01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:40.100]  with Kayan Drance and Johnny, I don't even know
[01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:41.580]  his first name, Johnny.
[01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:42.820]  Manzari. Manzari.
[01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:45.420]  From Apple, he's a user interface designer,
[01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:47.220]  works on camera stuff.
[01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:49.220]  And I thought it was a terrific interview.
[01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:53.900]  I'm curious post-interview what your thoughts are.
[01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:57.940]  Pre and post-interview and what are your thoughts
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:59.460]  when you first saw cinematic mode
[01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:01.180]  and what are your thoughts now, you know,
[01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:02.380]  one week post-review?
[01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:05.940]  Yeah, so obviously you saw the presentation
[01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:08.780]  and you know, I watched it like all of us
[01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:09.740]  and we're like, oh, look at that.
[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:11.460]  You know, it's like, you know, you're in the flow
[01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:14.860]  and trying to cover everything and type about it
[01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:16.540]  and give people observations.
[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:17.780]  And so it's like, oh, cool, cool.
[01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:19.660]  And you just don't get to really, you know,
[01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:22.100]  absorb it all that deeply.
[01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:25.740]  I definitely was, their demo film kind of cracked me up
[01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:27.580]  because it was super rack focus heavy.
[01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:29.500]  Obviously they're showing off the feature.
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:30.900]  So you can't fault them for that.
[01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:33.100]  When somebody made a joke on Twitter, which I laughed about
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:35.060]  and it was, it was like, I don't know,
[01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:37.340]  Apple demonstrates how to like make people sick
[01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:41.780]  a rack focus or something, which is funny,
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:43.140]  but you know, they got to show it off, right?
[01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:47.660]  So it's a narrative told essentially all in focus changes,
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:49.900]  which in some ways is cool.
[01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:52.820]  And honestly, some directors work that way, right?
[01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:55.260]  Some directors work with fixed frame
[01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:59.380]  and focal plane changes, hopefully not to excess,
[01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:02.740]  but honestly as a really big pillar
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:05.460]  of their storytelling modes, right?
[01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:07.940]  Robert Altman, Steven Spielberg, you know,
[01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:10.340]  there are a handful of directors that just use
[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:15.340]  the focal plane as a, in a motive directorial
[01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:20.180]  narrative driving tool and all directors for the most part,
[01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:21.660]  use it to some degree.
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:25.980]  Now I will say that like for a long time and for a while,
[01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:28.660]  this is sort of subtext to this whole conversation
[01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:31.940]  about adding rack focus and synthetic bokeh
[01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:35.260]  and all of this stuff to digital camera or to an iPhone.
[01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:38.780]  When the switch to digital happened,
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:41.580]  one of the first things to go to one of the first
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:46.500]  storytelling tools that everyone lost was bokeh, right?
[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:50.020]  Was background blur, selective focus,
[01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:51.260]  whatever you want to call it,
[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:54.020]  slim field of focus, et cetera.
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:56.220]  It was one of the first tools to go specifically
[01:25:56.220 --> 01:26:01.220]  because digital cameras, most of the early cameras
[01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:05.660]  that were used by filmmakers, DVC cameras
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:07.420]  and those of that kind,
[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:09.820]  they actually did not take standard lenses, right?
[01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:11.460]  They used integrated lenses.
[01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:13.620]  And I mean, especially in the indie world, right?
[01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:15.820]  Obviously there are a lot of high end shooters
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:18.780]  that still had access to detachable cameras
[01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:20.820]  and all this stuff or detachable lenses,
[01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:22.900]  but a lot of the run and gun filmmakers
[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:24.940]  and people who came up with the world,
[01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:26.340]  the Aronofskys of the world
[01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:29.580]  and people that were playing around with digital early,
[01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:31.620]  Steven Soderbergh, et cetera,
[01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:35.780]  the footage that they shot and the films that they shot
[01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:37.900]  had this sort of inherent flatness,
[01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:41.780]  both of tone and of focus because of the lens size
[01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:45.020]  and the distance away from the CCD that the lens rested,
[01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:47.300]  it inherently created this deep,
[01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:49.100]  hyper deep field of focus.
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:50.940]  And they utilized it as a tool, right?
[01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:52.620]  As sort of the opposite kind of tool
[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:55.980]  about how to direct a person's eye
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:57.860]  through the frame without focus,
[01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:00.300]  like now they had to change their language, right?
[01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:01.500]  And learn new languages.
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:03.340]  And this was sort of part of the transition
[01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:06.500]  from film and shooting on film
[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:09.140]  and shooting analog to shooting digital, right?
[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:12.500]  Was this era where there was a lot of that going on.
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:14.380]  And then eventually, of course,
[01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:16.220]  the cameras caught up
[01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:19.180]  and that tool was added back to their tool bag.
[01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:21.180]  But what you end up with with an iPhone
[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:25.100]  is the absolute pinnacle of that kind of camera.
[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:29.140]  It's like to the extreme because the lens is so small
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:32.940]  and it's so close to the plane of the sensor
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:37.340]  that it inherently has an insanely deep field of focus.
[01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:38.180]  You can see this,
[01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:40.140]  like when you just shoot a regular picture,
[01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:42.540]  the reason that you can select a focus point
[01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:45.460]  deeper into the image and not with cinematic mode
[01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:47.900]  is because inherently most of the field
[01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:50.820]  that you see in your lens is in focus, almost all of it.
[01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:53.180]  And that's just part of the physics
[01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:54.940]  of the way these lenses work.
[01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:57.900]  So you've got that whole context going in
[01:27:57.900 --> 01:28:01.300]  that previously to this feature being launched,
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:04.220]  you had pretty much no options or alternatives
[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:06.380]  besides trying to use the telephoto
[01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:08.420]  and shooting as close as possible, right?
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:12.100]  To introduce natural bokeh to the lens.
[01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:15.100]  You could use some post-processing or whatever,
[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:17.820]  but inherently most of the films,
[01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:18.980]  you know, if you were trying to shoot a film
[01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:20.820]  that was shot on iPhone,
[01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:23.140]  had inherently hyper deep focus
[01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:24.900]  because of the physics of the lens.
[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:27.780]  So now you go and say, all right,
[01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:29.500]  like how are we gonna fix this?
[01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:33.420]  You know, or how are we gonna introduce the language of film
[01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:37.460]  back into the iPhone in a way that can reward people
[01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:39.900]  both that are really good at this stuff
[01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:42.380]  and people that may not even know the language
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:45.540]  or how to speak the language, but want to, right?
[01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:47.620]  They know, they've grown up watching films
[01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:49.740]  and watching movies and they would love
[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:52.060]  a more movie-like look to their images.
[01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:54.460]  They just have no idea how to get from zero to one.
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:56.460]  And that's the problem that they started with.
[01:28:56.460 --> 01:29:00.300]  Not, oh, we need a cinematic mode on the iPhone.
[01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:01.780]  How do we build it?
[01:29:01.780 --> 01:29:05.940]  It's how do we take that language of cinema
[01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:09.780]  that's hundreds of years old and make it accessible
[01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:12.660]  to almost anybody that was able to pick up this camera
[01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:15.300]  and spend a few minutes learning how to use this feature.
[01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:18.300]  And that I think was, you know, is the thing Apple does
[01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:21.140]  so well, they take a really complex, hard problem
[01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:23.860]  and then sort of put it through the intestinal tract
[01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:25.900]  of their development process
[01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:27.620]  and small teams development process
[01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:29.060]  and come out the other side,
[01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:32.220]  hopefully with something that's actually useful.
[01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:34.300]  It's sort of, and the way they've done it
[01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:38.380]  is sort of taking the weakness,
[01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:43.180]  which is that you inherently have this very deep field
[01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:46.420]  of focus with video shooting on the iPhone
[01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:49.540]  and weakness in terms of if you want
[01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:51.940]  a depth of field bokeh effect
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:54.660]  and turning it into a strength
[01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:58.140]  by doing it all computationally,
[01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:03.140]  but having that depth there in the footage that you shot
[01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:05.820]  and using computational photography
[01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:09.180]  to artificially compute the blurring
[01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:11.340]  of either the foreground or the background.
[01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:13.900]  But because that depth of focus is there,
[01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:15.740]  you can change it all in post.
[01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:17.820]  And so if the wrong thing happens
[01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:22.820]  and you were counting on the machine language driven AI
[01:30:23.780 --> 01:30:28.060]  to notice that your actors turn their head
[01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:31.380]  to look at another actor and wanted the focus to shift
[01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:34.940]  from the first actor to the second,
[01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:36.780]  and it didn't happen or it didn't happen
[01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:38.380]  when you wanted it to,
[01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:40.900]  you just tweak it in post and it's there
[01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:43.540]  and you didn't lose anything.
[01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:45.260]  I'm very impressed by it.
[01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:47.020]  And I know it's so much,
[01:30:47.020 --> 01:30:50.060]  the analogies to portrait mode stills and iPhone
[01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:54.420]  are very similar where it has some problems getting hair
[01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:59.420]  and the edges of hair and the frame of somebody's glasses
[01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:03.060]  if they're at like at a 45 degree angle
[01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:07.580]  where the outer frame of the far lens of their glasses
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:09.540]  is not really part of their face.
[01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:12.540]  It's like the machine language is looking for a face
[01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:14.900]  and so the glasses can sometimes get blurred out.
[01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:16.780]  It's the same exact problems,
[01:31:16.780 --> 01:31:19.700]  but that's gotten a lot better with portrait mode
[01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:20.740]  year after year.
[01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:23.420]  It's that typical Apple incrementalism
[01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:26.500]  where they just keep grinding away at this problem
[01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:30.060]  and they know the problems better than anybody.
[01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:35.060]  And the results can be really, really impressive though.
[01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:36.900]  I think this is really cool.
[01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:38.700]  And again, if you don't care about it,
[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:39.780]  you don't have to shoot it.
[01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:42.740]  This one actually is a dedicated mode, unlike macro.
[01:31:42.740 --> 01:31:45.020]  So you're never gonna accidentally end up
[01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:48.900]  with the cinematic mode footage if you didn't want it.
[01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:52.580]  But even if that happens, you can just turn it off.
[01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:54.420]  You can just take the whole clip and you're like,
[01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:57.260]  ah, crap, this focus stuff is not appropriate
[01:31:57.260 --> 01:31:59.360]  for this thing I shot at all.
[01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:02.740]  You can just go in and edit it and turn off cinematic mode
[01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:07.380]  and you just get the non cinematic version of the video
[01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:10.260]  with everything in focus as you would expect.
[01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:12.020]  So you've lost nothing, right?
[01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:16.700]  It's not like, ah, I blew my chance at my kid's home run
[01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:17.820]  in the little league game
[01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:20.620]  because I was a dope shooting cinematic mode.
[01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:22.820]  Yeah, trying to get this focus right, yeah.
[01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:23.780]  Right, right. Exactly.
[01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:26.260]  And the kid gets the first base and he's all blurry
[01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:28.940]  and I wanted to, you know, they just turn it off.
[01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:30.660]  You can just turn it off and you're fine.
[01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:32.620]  Every once in a while, yeah, every once in a while
[01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:34.980]  you can hit the limits of the focusing range, right?
[01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:37.140]  So like if you're shooting something extremely close
[01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:39.940]  and the thing you wanna focus on is extremely far away
[01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:42.180]  and your camera is physically very close
[01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:43.700]  to the foreground object,
[01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:45.620]  the background can still be out of focus, right?
[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:47.220]  So it's not completely foolproof.
[01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:50.380]  But in most casual shooting situations,
[01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:52.140]  people are gonna have a ton of options
[01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:54.300]  and what to choose and what to pick from.
[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:57.720]  And Apple did a ton of work and will continue to do more
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:59.620]  with sort of automatically directing it.
[01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:01.740]  It's actually crazy how much stuff is going on there
[01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:02.980]  and I think most people don't realize
[01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:04.580]  exactly how much is happening,
[01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:06.500]  especially the people who are poo pooing it
[01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:09.100]  because yes, the background segmentation
[01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:11.180]  still has its weaknesses
[01:33:11.180 --> 01:33:16.180]  and it still has a general loss of resolution
[01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:19.180]  or definition around the edges, as you mentioned here,
[01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:21.260]  especially if the background is complex.
[01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:23.100]  You know, chain link fences or trees
[01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:24.700]  or whatever the case may be, right?
[01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:27.780]  Like there are instances where it just falls over
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:29.020]  and some people don't like it
[01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:31.820]  and some people, it just irritates me to know it.
[01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:33.600]  Great, fine, right?
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.240]  But for a lot of people,
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:38.900]  I think it's actually going to be really cool and fun
[01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:39.860]  in the near term.
[01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:43.160]  And then long-term, as it gets better and better,
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:45.700]  it's actually gonna become a real tool, right?
[01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:48.060]  Like there's this big phrase in Silicon Valley
[01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:51.160]  like that big changes or big inventions
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:55.020]  often begin being perceived as toys, right?
[01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:56.860]  Like, oh, look at this toy, right?
[01:33:56.860 --> 01:33:59.180]  And then it's like, no, it's not a toy now.
[01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:00.860]  Like there's a billion dollar business
[01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:01.860]  on the top of it, right?
[01:34:01.860 --> 01:34:05.340]  Personal computers in general were toys and they
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:08.280]  became accepted and then the Macintosh came out
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:10.380]  and the graphical user interface was a toy
[01:34:10.380 --> 01:34:13.940]  because the serious ones all had a command line.
[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:15.540]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:16.440]  Where's my DOS?
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:17.740]  Yeah, exactly, that's it.
[01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:19.840]  And I think that's what the state that this is in
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:21.980]  at the moment, it's not quite a toy.
[01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:24.740]  I mean, it's hard to call it a toy when it actually,
[01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:26.440]  I think, turns out pretty great results
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:30.080]  in a lot of instances and there's so much
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:32.500]  computational power behind it but I can understand
[01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:35.980]  it being perceived as a gimmick or toy
[01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:38.880]  in its current state, I get that, right?
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:41.800]  But it's not, it is actually much more
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:45.220]  and it may take some time for it to realize that potential
[01:34:45.220 --> 01:34:48.700]  and it certainly is not perfect by any means
[01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:51.860]  but it's far more than a throwaway BS thing
[01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:52.900]  that doesn't work.
[01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:55.540]  And frankly, when I was reading some of the other reviews
[01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:58.300]  of this thing, of the feature or people that integrated
[01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:01.740]  into their reviews, my big takeaway was that everybody
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:04.360]  was reviewing it wrong and I don't wanna call anybody out
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:06.140]  individually because I think people are great
[01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:08.380]  and everybody's gotta focus and everybody, you know,
[01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:10.700]  I respect people's opinions based on intelligent
[01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:13.340]  understanding and the fact of the matter is,
[01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:17.420]  it's absolutely viable to look at the results
[01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:21.020]  from shooting it in testing, very close testing
[01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:24.180]  of a particular object or trying to isolate subjects,
[01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:26.300]  trying to break down the various things that are happening
[01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:30.340]  from synthetic bokeh to gaze detection and following
[01:35:30.340 --> 01:35:33.780]  to automatic tracking to focus tracking
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:35.600]  which are two different things.
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:38.840]  It's fair to break all those down and like test each one
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:41.300]  of them individually but the fact of the matter is,
[01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:44.620]  there's no, unlike many other tests,
[01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:48.820]  there really is no baseline to test from.
[01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:50.660]  Like this is brand new.
[01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:55.460]  It is not what you were, it emulates other things
[01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:57.420]  but this is a brand new feature, right?
[01:35:57.420 --> 01:36:00.460]  It's a brand new thing that this bundle of things
[01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:04.080]  that they've created is brand new and so I think testing it
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:09.080]  in the same kind of test bed or lab focused environment
[01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:11.820]  to try and say, does this thing work the way they say it does
[01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:14.260]  or look at the segmentation falls over here and there
[01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:16.480]  and it just sucks, it doesn't really work at night,
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:19.020]  it doesn't work this way or that way or the other thing,
[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:24.020]  absolutely 100% valid, viable but I feel misses the point
[01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:27.820]  so badly as to actually misrepresent the feature entirely.
[01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:32.820]  You end up in a situation where all of the negative bits
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:36.600]  actually end up to a larger negative value
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:39.420]  than the feature actually deserves, right?
[01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:41.980]  So like while acknowledging that it has flaws
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:44.900]  and it is by no means perfect and Apple will be the first
[01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:47.020]  to admit that if you can get them to do it on the record
[01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:50.780]  which good luck but the team knows, right?
[01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:53.200]  Like they know that they're working towards something
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:54.740]  but the fact of the matter is it's actually
[01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:57.300]  really fucking cool right now and it works at night,
[01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:59.300]  sorry, I tried it, it works fine,
[01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:00.620]  I don't know what people are doing there
[01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:03.580]  that not make it work, it also works in many situations
[01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:06.100]  where Apple says it should work and it does.
[01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:09.500]  If I've seen it follow the gaze of a person
[01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:11.860]  to focus on another person in the frame,
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:15.200]  I've seen it use overscan to track and see
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:18.320]  that a person is entering the frame and then switch focus
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:20.380]  from the person you're focused on in the frame
[01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:22.620]  to that other person automatically.
[01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:26.060]  This is, none of this is even talking about the fact
[01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:28.660]  that you can change it afterwards if you need to
[01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:31.340]  or if it misses which it does, right?
[01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:32.460]  But that's not even talking about,
[01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:36.380]  this is talking about the casual use of an 80 percenter,
[01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:38.420]  right, the person who grabs the iPhone is like,
[01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:40.100]  oh cool, look at this new mode,
[01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:41.020]  I'm gonna play around with this
[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:42.480]  and shoots their kids with it,
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:44.820]  the results that are gonna get out of it, sure,
[01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:47.400]  one in 10, two in 10, three in 10 may go like,
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:48.240]  oh, that was kind of funky,
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:49.640]  I don't know if I like that or not
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:53.100]  but a lot of people are going to start shooting
[01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:58.100]  and thinking and being able to enjoy their home movies
[01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:01.980]  with the language of movies and film and cinema
[01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:05.080]  now available to them than were ever before
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:09.200]  because they never owned a camera with detachable lenses
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:14.200]  and a gimbal and a rack focusing pulley or wheel
[01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:16.060]  and all that.
[01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:20.900]  They not only don't have a kit to do focus pulling,
[01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:24.180]  they don't have someone to be the focus puller.
[01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:25.380]  Right.
[01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:27.620]  There's a Kubrick quote that I abuse,
[01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:29.900]  I overuse it so much but I love it
[01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:32.340]  and to me explains so many things that I care about
[01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:34.460]  and why I care about them and it is,
[01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:38.640]  sometimes the truth of a thing is not in the think of it
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:40.220]  but in the feel of it
[01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:42.940]  and that to me is exactly what this,
[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:44.940]  you can think about it and examine,
[01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:47.900]  ah, the ear's out of focus, the hair's out of focus
[01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:51.300]  and the left frame of the eyeglasses shouldn't be blurred
[01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:55.020]  but it is and then you can watch a movie like Float
[01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:59.660]  and you get the feels and that's the truth of the feature.
[01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:00.500]  Anyway.
[01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:01.320]  Right.
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:02.160]  Let's call it a wrap.
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:04.740]  Matthew Panzareno, I thank you so much for your time
[01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:05.980]  and your insight.
[01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:07.320]  I can't think of anybody else
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:08.940]  I would rather talk iPhone camera with
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:12.720]  other than Johnny Manzari and Kyan Drance
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:13.800]  who you got to talk to.
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:17.860]  So it's like I've gotten them on the show
[01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:20.380]  and it's one degree of separation.
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:23.900]  Let me also thank our sponsors, great sponsors this week.
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:28.900]  Memberful and LinkedIn and Mack Weldon, my thanks to them.
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:43.580]  Thanks.
