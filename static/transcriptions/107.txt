[00:00.000 --> 00:01.500]  What kind of microphone do you have?
[00:01.500 --> 00:03.520]  I know you were gonna give me like a,
[00:03.520 --> 00:06.600]  how to improve my audio, some help a while ago,
[00:06.600 --> 00:07.600]  and then we never followed through.
[00:07.600 --> 00:09.140]  What kind of mic do you have?
[00:09.140 --> 00:12.640]  So I have both of the ones that everyone says
[00:12.640 --> 00:14.360]  are the best mics for this purpose.
[00:14.360 --> 00:16.740]  I have the Heil PR40 that Dan Benjamin
[00:16.740 --> 00:20.620]  and all those people use, and I have the Shure SM7B.
[00:20.620 --> 00:22.360]  And I prefer the Shure, I prefer the way
[00:22.360 --> 00:23.540]  my voice sounds with the Shure.
[00:23.540 --> 00:26.480]  The Heil PR40 makes people sound a little bit more nasal
[00:26.480 --> 00:28.800]  and has like weird, it's like,
[00:28.800 --> 00:30.680]  it's missing like the mid-bass,
[00:30.680 --> 00:32.760]  but it has a lot of the lower bass.
[00:32.760 --> 00:36.040]  So you sound like really bassy, but not that present
[00:36.040 --> 00:38.240]  and not that warm with the PR40.
[00:38.240 --> 00:42.460]  So the SM7B is a really, really nice sounding mic,
[00:42.460 --> 00:44.340]  probably the best sounding mic for this purpose,
[00:44.340 --> 00:46.540]  but has the giant asterisk that it needs
[00:46.540 --> 00:49.520]  a really nice and generally very expensive preamp
[00:49.520 --> 00:51.200]  to power it properly.
[00:51.200 --> 00:52.560]  Yeah, screw that.
[00:52.560 --> 00:56.480]  So that's what I use, of course.
[00:56.480 --> 00:58.680]  Now I've got the old Rode Podcaster,
[00:58.680 --> 01:02.500]  which is probably, I don't know, I guess I could do better.
[01:02.500 --> 01:04.440]  You could, I mean, there's a question
[01:04.440 --> 01:05.680]  on how much it matters.
[01:05.680 --> 01:09.200]  Because your show has guests that rotate out every week,
[01:09.200 --> 01:11.920]  like, you don't wanna sound that different from the guests.
[01:11.920 --> 01:13.700]  Now there have been a lot of episodes of your show
[01:13.700 --> 01:15.580]  where I think you sound worse than the guests,
[01:15.580 --> 01:18.740]  but that might be because of like weird EQ going on
[01:18.740 --> 01:20.160]  or something else going on, you know,
[01:20.160 --> 01:21.880]  that might be something else in the process
[01:21.880 --> 01:24.520]  being not that great, I don't know.
[01:26.220 --> 01:28.480]  And the other thing is, how do you talk into your mic?
[01:28.480 --> 01:31.000]  I keep the mic underneath my face.
[01:31.000 --> 01:34.240]  Like I'm not, it's sticking straight up
[01:34.240 --> 01:36.240]  and I'm, you know, it's close to my mouth,
[01:36.240 --> 01:39.400]  but I have it where it's underneath my face.
[01:39.400 --> 01:42.280]  It's more or less like at my chin and going down.
[01:42.280 --> 01:43.400]  Yeah, you're doing it wrong.
[01:43.400 --> 01:46.680]  Yeah, I'm supposed to be like staring right into it, right?
[01:46.680 --> 01:47.520]  Yeah, pretty much.
[01:47.520 --> 01:50.040]  Like my, and like, yeah, like so for mine,
[01:50.040 --> 01:53.640]  like because I have the crazy low output SM7B,
[01:53.640 --> 01:56.160]  I am, like my lips are almost touching the pop filter.
[01:56.160 --> 01:58.040]  Sometimes they do touch the pop filter.
[01:58.040 --> 01:59.240]  I'm like right on top of it,
[01:59.240 --> 02:01.040]  talking directly straight on into it.
[02:02.040 --> 02:04.200]  Yeah, see what happened, I'm asking all these questions
[02:04.200 --> 02:07.220]  because I came in, I spent a big chunk of the holidays
[02:07.220 --> 02:08.880]  not working in my home office.
[02:08.880 --> 02:11.520]  Was downstairs, you know, in the dining room,
[02:11.520 --> 02:14.720]  you know, being more of a, you know, part of the family.
[02:18.160 --> 02:23.160]  And I came up to record the Star Wars episode
[02:23.160 --> 02:26.920]  of the show with Sir Cusin Guy.
[02:26.920 --> 02:27.760]  That was good, by the way.
[02:27.760 --> 02:29.880]  I thought I would hate that because it was so long.
[02:29.880 --> 02:31.400]  I don't care that much about Star Wars,
[02:31.400 --> 02:32.440]  but that was actually really good.
[02:32.440 --> 02:33.280]  I really enjoyed it.
[02:33.280 --> 02:35.040]  Those are the compliments from people who said,
[02:35.040 --> 02:37.040]  I don't even like Star Wars, but I liked that show.
[02:37.040 --> 02:39.200]  That to me was, that's all that matters.
[02:39.200 --> 02:42.000]  That kid, that meant that it came out the way I wanted it to.
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.320]  I came up to my office and the mic,
[02:44.320 --> 02:46.960]  my mic arm was on the ground in front of my desk.
[02:46.960 --> 02:49.880]  And I thought, I knew I didn't put it there.
[02:49.880 --> 02:52.080]  And Amy records her voice.
[02:52.080 --> 02:54.080]  Amy records her show up here.
[02:54.080 --> 02:57.160]  And I didn't think she'd recorded her episode recently,
[02:57.160 --> 02:58.560]  but I thought it must've been her.
[02:58.560 --> 03:00.320]  And I was like, why in the world would she disconnect it
[03:00.320 --> 03:02.880]  from the desk and put it on the floor?
[03:02.880 --> 03:04.080]  And I was a little annoyed.
[03:04.080 --> 03:05.720]  And then I looked and it was the fact
[03:05.720 --> 03:07.680]  that the arm mount had broken.
[03:07.680 --> 03:09.920]  It just like, just right where you would think,
[03:09.920 --> 03:12.280]  right where the clamp goes on the desk,
[03:12.280 --> 03:13.960]  just like a stress fracture.
[03:15.200 --> 03:17.560]  Which kind of makes sense because it's, you know,
[03:17.560 --> 03:18.880]  supports a fair amount of weight.
[03:18.880 --> 03:20.640]  And it's the same arm that I had had
[03:20.640 --> 03:23.360]  ever since I started doing the first run of the show,
[03:23.360 --> 03:25.080]  which I think was like 2007.
[03:25.080 --> 03:26.640]  I don't even know when that was.
[03:26.640 --> 03:31.360]  So, but anyway, I had to get a new podcast arm.
[03:31.360 --> 03:33.520]  And of course I didn't set it up until right
[03:33.520 --> 03:35.440]  when we were supposed to record tonight.
[03:35.440 --> 03:36.280]  Naturally.
[03:36.280 --> 03:38.440]  And I'm looking at the instructions and it's like, wow,
[03:38.440 --> 03:40.120]  they're showing me to set this mic up
[03:40.120 --> 03:43.320]  in a very different way than I have ever,
[03:43.320 --> 03:44.560]  ever used the microphone.
[03:46.080 --> 03:47.120]  Yeah, no, you're definitely doing it wrong.
[03:47.120 --> 03:49.360]  I mean, certain mics are made to be addressed
[03:49.360 --> 03:52.800]  like on the side, but that's not one of them.
[03:52.800 --> 03:54.200]  Yeah, but I'm not talking into the side.
[03:54.200 --> 03:56.120]  I am talking into the top of it.
[03:56.120 --> 03:58.040]  Well, you're kind of talking like over the top of it.
[03:58.040 --> 03:58.880]  Like you'd play a flute.
[03:58.880 --> 04:01.040]  Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.
[04:01.040 --> 04:02.680]  Yeah, that's no good.
[04:02.680 --> 04:03.520]  Yeah, I don't know.
[04:03.520 --> 04:05.200]  Maybe I could try to fix it right now.
[04:05.200 --> 04:06.640]  It seems to me though that if I do it their way,
[04:06.640 --> 04:08.200]  I'm going to, it's what I'm going to be seeing.
[04:08.200 --> 04:10.880]  I won't be able to see like my computer or anything.
[04:10.880 --> 04:12.520]  Yeah, you kind of got to like look through them,
[04:12.520 --> 04:15.080]  like through the arm and kind of look, you know.
[04:16.080 --> 04:17.960]  I mean, yeah, I don't know.
[04:17.960 --> 04:21.760]  Yeah, maybe I'll put it at an angle or something.
[04:21.760 --> 04:23.960]  Does this sound any better?
[04:23.960 --> 04:25.360]  Yeah, you sound a little bit louder, a little bit clearer.
[04:25.360 --> 04:27.080]  I mean, it's not a huge difference,
[04:27.080 --> 04:29.280]  but it's a little different.
[04:29.280 --> 04:31.400]  All right, if you hear a terrible noise,
[04:31.400 --> 04:33.480]  it means that I've unscrewed this thing.
[04:35.320 --> 04:37.560]  I mean, the RØDE Podcaster is not an amazing mic.
[04:37.560 --> 04:38.400]  Like you're not going to,
[04:38.400 --> 04:40.640]  you're never going to sound amazing from it,
[04:40.640 --> 04:42.800]  but you can sound good enough from it.
[04:42.800 --> 04:44.400]  I can't get the thing screwed onto.
[04:44.400 --> 04:46.000]  All right, well, oh shit.
[04:46.000 --> 04:51.000]  This will make for excellent audio, what a broadcast.
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.880]  All right, oh, now it's all floppy.
[04:57.880 --> 04:59.480]  These things are ridiculous.
[05:00.480 --> 05:02.640]  Also the RØDE Boom Arm that I assume you're using,
[05:02.640 --> 05:04.880]  I'm also using one, it's not the best arm.
[05:04.880 --> 05:07.640]  I mean, it's pretty shitty, like it works,
[05:07.640 --> 05:12.280]  but like mine, like any slight vibration anywhere,
[05:12.280 --> 05:13.560]  like in the desk or anything,
[05:13.560 --> 05:16.160]  a spring inside the arm rattles,
[05:16.160 --> 05:17.440]  which is completely opposite
[05:17.440 --> 05:19.440]  of the kind of thing it's supposed to do.
[05:20.440 --> 05:23.080]  And it's just like, I haven't ever replaced it
[05:23.080 --> 05:25.160]  because like, you know, it's not broken yet.
[05:25.160 --> 05:27.000]  It still works, but.
[05:27.000 --> 05:29.760]  I even had the thought when I had to order one,
[05:29.760 --> 05:32.520]  I just went to Amazon and I saw that it said RØDE
[05:32.520 --> 05:33.600]  and I thought, well, I've got a RØDE mic,
[05:33.600 --> 05:34.440]  might as well get it.
[05:34.440 --> 05:35.280]  Yeah.
[05:36.280 --> 05:37.440]  And the old one was a Heil.
[05:37.440 --> 05:38.280]  Is that how you pronounce it?
[05:38.280 --> 05:39.120]  Yeah.
[05:39.120 --> 05:40.960]  Well, that's how other people pronounce it, I don't know.
[05:40.960 --> 05:41.800]  All right.
[05:41.800 --> 05:42.640]  All right.
[05:44.080 --> 05:46.520]  And even though, like I said, it was seven years old
[05:46.520 --> 05:48.680]  and I sort of don't, I'm not really angry that it broke,
[05:48.680 --> 05:50.120]  I still feel like, well, it broke,
[05:50.120 --> 05:51.400]  I'm not gonna buy another Heil.
[05:51.400 --> 05:52.240]  Right.
[05:53.440 --> 05:54.480]  So I just bought the RØDE.
[05:54.480 --> 05:56.120]  But then I had this, and it was one of those things
[05:56.120 --> 05:58.880]  where I, you know, Amazon makes it so easy.
[05:58.880 --> 06:00.400]  So it's like, that's my thought process.
[06:00.400 --> 06:03.120]  My thought process was not a Heil.
[06:04.400 --> 06:06.160]  I already have a RØDE mic
[06:06.160 --> 06:08.240]  and it looked highly rated on Amazon.
[06:08.240 --> 06:10.800]  And so like two clicks later, it was on its way.
[06:10.800 --> 06:13.320]  And so then with a little bit of thought, I thought,
[06:13.320 --> 06:16.160]  hmm, maybe I should have taken the usual advice
[06:16.160 --> 06:17.080]  and asked Marco.
[06:18.200 --> 06:19.040]  No, I mean, that's what I'm,
[06:19.040 --> 06:20.600]  I'm using the exact same arm, like the RØDE,
[06:20.600 --> 06:24.080]  you know, PS whatever arm, it's their only arm, I think.
[06:24.080 --> 06:25.360]  I'm using the same one.
[06:25.360 --> 06:26.760]  Just because I had the Podcaster,
[06:26.760 --> 06:28.640]  like I bought the kit for five by five
[06:28.640 --> 06:30.320]  and then I upgraded my mic,
[06:30.320 --> 06:32.920]  but never upgraded the boom arm because it still works.
[06:32.920 --> 06:35.000]  The desk clamp does look sturdier than the Heil.
[06:35.000 --> 06:37.200]  Like the Heil, after having looked at it,
[06:37.200 --> 06:38.320]  it's like, I'm kind of surprised
[06:38.320 --> 06:40.840]  it didn't snap off right away.
[06:40.840 --> 06:41.800]  Yeah, I mean like, I don't really know
[06:41.800 --> 06:44.040]  where the RØDE one would break.
[06:44.040 --> 06:45.840]  Like looking at the construction, like, you know,
[06:45.840 --> 06:48.200]  I don't know what part of this would be the weak point,
[06:48.200 --> 06:49.920]  but I don't think, I mean,
[06:49.920 --> 06:52.720]  I think it's more likely that like one of the springs
[06:52.720 --> 06:54.280]  in the arm would snap and it would lose tension
[06:54.280 --> 06:55.960]  and just drop to the desk.
[06:55.960 --> 06:56.800]  Yeah.
[06:56.800 --> 06:58.080]  I think that would be more likely to fail.
[06:58.080 --> 06:59.680]  Yeah, and that actually was starting to happen
[06:59.680 --> 07:02.800]  with my Heil, that it was starting to lose some tension.
[07:02.800 --> 07:06.200]  And I could not, there's no way to like adjust that.
[07:06.200 --> 07:09.560]  Yeah, the RØDE has these weird screws on the arm,
[07:09.560 --> 07:11.240]  but I don't know if those do anything.
[07:11.240 --> 07:12.080]  Yeah.
[07:12.080 --> 07:13.680]  What are these Velcro straps for?
[07:13.680 --> 07:16.440]  Those are for attaching the cable.
[07:16.440 --> 07:19.160]  Like you basically attach the cable to the arm
[07:19.160 --> 07:20.960]  on its way down using those.
[07:22.440 --> 07:24.040]  So that way you can have like a nice tidy cable
[07:24.040 --> 07:26.000]  going down to the base of the arm.
[07:26.000 --> 07:27.800]  Oh, that would be nice.
[07:27.800 --> 07:29.560]  Yeah, that's what they're for.
[07:29.560 --> 07:30.840]  All right, anyway.
[07:30.840 --> 07:32.560]  Yeah, I'll take a picture of my setup.
[07:32.560 --> 07:33.880]  Quiet week for you.
[07:33.880 --> 07:34.720]  Yeah.
[07:34.720 --> 07:36.680]  Yeah, nothing's ever going on.
[07:36.680 --> 07:38.520]  It's a...
[07:38.520 --> 07:42.600]  For the record, we're recording on Thursday the 8th,
[07:42.600 --> 07:45.880]  which is a night after you recorded ATP,
[07:45.880 --> 07:48.160]  where I presume you talked about probably all the same things
[07:48.160 --> 07:49.000]  we're gonna talk about tonight,
[07:49.000 --> 07:51.560]  but I couldn't have listened to it yet
[07:51.560 --> 07:54.040]  because I didn't catch the live broadcast.
[07:55.040 --> 07:56.600]  But people like you, they won't mind hearing you
[07:56.600 --> 07:57.440]  talk about it twice.
[07:57.440 --> 07:58.920]  Yeah, they should be all right.
[08:00.320 --> 08:03.040]  When did you publish your piece, Sunday?
[08:03.040 --> 08:03.880]  Yeah, it was Sunday.
[08:03.880 --> 08:05.920]  Yeah, it was Sunday night.
[08:05.920 --> 08:08.840]  Part of the problem, I think, was that I published it
[08:10.320 --> 08:14.600]  on a Sunday night right as a holiday vacation
[08:14.600 --> 08:16.320]  for a lot of people was ending,
[08:16.320 --> 08:18.960]  and there's nothing going on in the news.
[08:18.960 --> 08:19.800]  Right.
[08:19.800 --> 08:22.120]  And so a lot of the places that picked it up,
[08:22.120 --> 08:23.680]  a lot of people were telling me,
[08:23.680 --> 08:25.640]  yeah, never publish things at that time
[08:25.640 --> 08:29.000]  because people are so desperate for news
[08:29.000 --> 08:30.640]  at some of these bigger sites
[08:30.640 --> 08:35.280]  that there's nothing going on in tech on a random Monday.
[08:35.280 --> 08:36.360]  I mean, CES was starting,
[08:36.360 --> 08:40.040]  but nothing had really been announced of any meaning yet.
[08:40.040 --> 08:43.360]  And so everyone was saying,
[08:43.360 --> 08:45.520]  I couldn't have possibly had worse timing
[08:45.520 --> 08:47.760]  if I didn't want it to be that noticed.
[08:47.760 --> 08:49.880]  Like if you had published the exact same piece,
[08:49.880 --> 08:54.520]  word for word, not changed one bit, but maybe on Wednesday,
[08:54.520 --> 08:56.840]  it might've, you know,
[08:56.840 --> 09:00.120]  I think it would've gotten the attention it deserved,
[09:00.120 --> 09:03.240]  but it wouldn't have gotten the attention it didn't deserve.
[09:03.240 --> 09:05.320]  I don't know how even to put it.
[09:05.320 --> 09:06.400]  Yeah, that's basically it.
[09:06.400 --> 09:07.960]  I mean, like it, I mean,
[09:08.840 --> 09:10.840]  honestly it didn't deserve the attention it got,
[09:10.840 --> 09:11.680]  that's for sure.
[09:12.560 --> 09:13.400]  It wasn't good.
[09:13.400 --> 09:15.440]  Like that's, the regret I have about it
[09:15.440 --> 09:16.680]  is that it just wasn't very good.
[09:16.680 --> 09:19.640]  Like it was nowhere near my best work.
[09:19.640 --> 09:23.160]  It was just, I didn't put enough effort into it.
[09:23.160 --> 09:25.240]  I made a bunch of little mistakes in it
[09:25.240 --> 09:26.640]  and it just wasn't very good.
[09:26.640 --> 09:30.720]  And then for that to become extremely widespread
[09:30.720 --> 09:34.560]  and to have it be under quite a bit of scrutiny,
[09:34.560 --> 09:36.760]  that is just frustrating.
[09:36.760 --> 09:37.600]  Yeah.
[09:37.600 --> 09:38.440]  So for the record, I mean, I'm sure-
[09:38.440 --> 09:39.260]  And it's my fault.
[09:39.260 --> 09:41.680]  People listening extemporaneously, like, you know,
[09:41.680 --> 09:43.520]  people who are listening when this episode first comes out
[09:43.520 --> 09:44.840]  will know exactly what we're talking about.
[09:44.840 --> 09:47.240]  But for the record, we should say what it was,
[09:47.240 --> 09:48.480]  which is that on Sunday,
[09:48.480 --> 09:50.160]  you published an article titled,
[09:50.160 --> 09:54.560]  headlined, Apple has lost the functional high ground.
[09:54.560 --> 09:59.240]  And I think if I may, a nutshell summary is,
[09:59.240 --> 10:01.520]  you've detected that over the last few years,
[10:01.520 --> 10:05.880]  the quality of Apple's software has gotten worse.
[10:05.880 --> 10:06.720]  Correct.
[10:06.720 --> 10:09.520]  Not any one particular thing, just in general.
[10:09.520 --> 10:13.640]  And that it concerns you about the future of the company.
[10:13.640 --> 10:15.560]  And it's the reason you switched to the Mac
[10:15.560 --> 10:16.960]  in the first place a decade ago
[10:16.960 --> 10:19.840]  is that you were sick of having little stupid things
[10:19.840 --> 10:22.420]  like little annoying bugs here or there,
[10:22.420 --> 10:26.600]  everywhere all day long, that it just works factor
[10:26.600 --> 10:29.960]  is sort of fading from Apple's software platforms.
[10:29.960 --> 10:30.800]  Right.
[10:30.800 --> 10:34.520]  And like, a lot of the pushback, I mean,
[10:34.520 --> 10:37.840]  the reason it spread so quickly, so incredibly quickly,
[10:37.840 --> 10:39.960]  I mean, it had hundreds of retweets
[10:39.960 --> 10:41.960]  within a few hours of publishing it.
[10:41.960 --> 10:44.440]  And then it spread from there.
[10:44.440 --> 10:46.080]  The reason it spread, I think,
[10:46.080 --> 10:47.920]  is because a lot of people agree.
[10:48.800 --> 10:51.200]  And a lot of people still argued with it, of course.
[10:51.200 --> 10:54.120]  But I think if I was totally wrong,
[10:54.120 --> 10:55.240]  it wouldn't have spread, you know,
[10:55.240 --> 10:58.080]  it's not like I'm publishing this on some major news site
[10:58.080 --> 10:59.320]  where people like you would make fun of me
[10:59.320 --> 11:00.300]  if I got it wrong.
[11:00.300 --> 11:02.300]  Like, I'm publishing this on my personal site,
[11:02.300 --> 11:05.440]  like, it's not widely read most of the time.
[11:05.440 --> 11:08.520]  And so, you know, I don't think it would have spread
[11:08.520 --> 11:10.960]  if there wasn't some truth there.
[11:10.960 --> 11:12.200]  Yeah, I think the word I used,
[11:12.200 --> 11:13.960]  and I saw a couple of other people use it,
[11:13.960 --> 11:15.200]  I know Hockenberry did too,
[11:15.200 --> 11:16.920]  and I think it's because it's the perfect word
[11:16.920 --> 11:18.300]  that it resonated.
[11:18.300 --> 11:20.320]  Right, or it hit a nerve, one of those.
[11:20.320 --> 11:22.680]  I think resonate is better.
[11:22.680 --> 11:23.520]  Yeah, probably.
[11:24.560 --> 11:26.120]  That's why you're the pro writer.
[11:26.120 --> 11:29.960]  I don't know, to me, resonate is exactly what happened.
[11:29.960 --> 11:34.640]  It's like it felt true more so than thought true.
[11:34.640 --> 11:35.600]  It just felt right.
[11:35.600 --> 11:38.080]  Right, and very few people have said
[11:38.080 --> 11:39.760]  you are completely wrong.
[11:39.760 --> 11:41.560]  Most people have just said,
[11:41.560 --> 11:43.360]  well, I would have said it differently,
[11:43.360 --> 11:45.100]  or it isn't as severe as you say.
[11:45.100 --> 11:47.600]  And that's like, you know, what I regret,
[11:47.600 --> 11:49.280]  and you know, where I felt my failing,
[11:49.280 --> 11:52.920]  was that I worded some things too severely,
[11:52.920 --> 11:56.320]  and which, of course, is a frequent problem I have.
[11:56.320 --> 11:58.860]  But so, you know, I worded some things too severely,
[11:58.860 --> 12:03.000]  and that detracted from the validity of what I wrote.
[12:03.000 --> 12:06.800]  But the fact is, I think the overall sentiment
[12:06.800 --> 12:09.600]  of Apple's software has some quality problems
[12:09.600 --> 12:13.100]  in recent years, and it doesn't seem to be getting better.
[12:13.100 --> 12:15.360]  That, I think, is what resonated with people
[12:15.360 --> 12:16.600]  pretty unambiguously.
[12:16.600 --> 12:20.120]  Yeah, you do, you have a sort of,
[12:20.120 --> 12:21.940]  it's almost like a no-nonsense style,
[12:21.940 --> 12:24.280]  like, and I'll vouch for it.
[12:24.280 --> 12:25.960]  You certainly aren't doing it.
[12:25.960 --> 12:29.000]  You're not sensational, you don't overstate things
[12:29.000 --> 12:30.520]  for sensational purposes,
[12:30.520 --> 12:33.160]  because you're not looking for hits or page views,
[12:33.160 --> 12:34.960]  because you don't even have, you know,
[12:34.960 --> 12:37.740]  you use the deck, you don't even get paid by page views.
[12:37.740 --> 12:39.640]  You know, like, you're not gonna get extra this month
[12:39.640 --> 12:41.680]  because you had an explosive story this week
[12:41.680 --> 12:43.240]  that got, you know, a couple hundred thousand
[12:43.240 --> 12:44.080]  extra page views.
[12:44.080 --> 12:44.920]  Doesn't give you a nickel.
[12:44.920 --> 12:46.940]  Right, in fact, it could actually cost me money
[12:46.940 --> 12:48.960]  if I end up going over some bandwidth allocations
[12:48.960 --> 12:51.440]  at my host, so the more popular an article is,
[12:51.440 --> 12:53.560]  it actually might cost me more money.
[12:53.560 --> 12:55.020]  That's funny, that's actually true, right,
[12:55.020 --> 12:57.160]  which is the opposite of when, you know,
[12:58.740 --> 13:01.360]  you know, when Dan Lyons trumps up something
[13:01.360 --> 13:03.560]  at ValleyWag, it's because, you know,
[13:03.560 --> 13:07.080]  they measure their success month to month by page views.
[13:07.080 --> 13:08.080]  You're not in that game.
[13:08.080 --> 13:09.740]  You know, that's not, and that's not the way
[13:09.740 --> 13:11.200]  that you overstated it.
[13:11.200 --> 13:13.840]  It's just sort of a no-nonsense style.
[13:13.840 --> 13:16.640]  Well, but, you know, and you're right
[13:16.640 --> 13:21.160]  that that's what I intended, but because I did use,
[13:21.160 --> 13:22.760]  like, so, one of the examples, like,
[13:22.760 --> 13:25.580]  I originally said quality has taken a nosedive,
[13:25.580 --> 13:27.120]  and that was the wrong word, really.
[13:27.120 --> 13:28.280]  It hasn't taken a nosedive.
[13:28.280 --> 13:30.960]  It's been a gradual decline, and what I meant really
[13:30.960 --> 13:33.600]  was a decline that's just now in really bad shape,
[13:33.600 --> 13:36.740]  but a nosedive suggests, like, an acceleration
[13:36.740 --> 13:39.560]  of, like, all of a sudden, it's now dropping quickly,
[13:39.560 --> 13:40.560]  and that's not really the case.
[13:40.560 --> 13:43.120]  It's more of a gradual progression, but anyway.
[13:43.120 --> 13:45.940]  So, like, you know, there are things like that,
[13:45.940 --> 13:48.640]  and yeah, overall, like, I regret having written it
[13:48.640 --> 13:53.000]  simply because it put some of my most mediocre
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.680]  to worst work in front of so many people
[13:56.680 --> 13:59.660]  and put my name on it forever, whereas, like,
[13:59.660 --> 14:02.920]  I don't regret having said that Apple has problems.
[14:02.920 --> 14:05.340]  I just regret that I didn't say it better.
[14:05.340 --> 14:07.160]  Right, and what happened then is that
[14:07.160 --> 14:08.880]  it really went explosive.
[14:08.880 --> 14:10.680]  I mean, like, you even said,
[14:10.680 --> 14:11.980]  I guess it was your Google Analytics,
[14:11.980 --> 14:14.920]  but whatever, you know, your analytics showed
[14:14.920 --> 14:16.960]  that it was more popular than anything
[14:16.960 --> 14:18.640]  you had written in all of 2014.
[14:18.640 --> 14:19.480]  Correct.
[14:19.480 --> 14:22.040]  Which is amazing, really, that, you know,
[14:22.040 --> 14:24.640]  five days into the year, you've already topped last year.
[14:24.640 --> 14:25.560]  It just got picked up.
[14:25.560 --> 14:28.780]  It got picked up and relinked and relinked and relinked,
[14:28.780 --> 14:31.400]  and I guess Business Insider got it started.
[14:31.400 --> 14:32.920]  Here's their headline.
[14:32.920 --> 14:37.240]  Apple's software is in a, quote, nosedive, end quote,
[14:37.240 --> 14:38.600]  that is deeply concerning.
[14:38.600 --> 14:43.120]  Long time Apple supporters, as Jay Arrow,
[14:43.120 --> 14:45.220]  writing a perfect Business Insider headline.
[14:45.220 --> 14:47.400]  Right, and the thing is, like, usually,
[14:47.400 --> 14:49.220]  I could pick on Business Insider and say,
[14:49.220 --> 14:51.400]  you guys are such pieces of shit for this,
[14:51.400 --> 14:52.720]  because usually they are.
[14:52.720 --> 14:55.200]  In this case, they really, the original version
[14:55.200 --> 14:58.000]  had a couple of, like, paraphrases in it
[14:58.000 --> 15:01.600]  that were not what I said, that were more inflammatory,
[15:01.600 --> 15:03.520]  but I since complained about them,
[15:03.520 --> 15:05.880]  and he updated them to be more accurate.
[15:05.880 --> 15:09.520]  So over, and the headline, like, I did say that.
[15:09.520 --> 15:11.480]  You know, as I said, I didn't really mean
[15:11.480 --> 15:13.560]  to say it that severely, but I did say that.
[15:13.560 --> 15:16.920]  So overall, of all the hack jobs they've done to me
[15:16.920 --> 15:19.280]  over the years, this is one of the better ones.
[15:20.480 --> 15:22.360]  Yeah, but it's, I guess, it's not, yeah,
[15:22.360 --> 15:24.240]  it's not necessarily that as it stands right now
[15:24.240 --> 15:28.800]  that it's unfair, but it's, you know, fuel to the fire.
[15:28.800 --> 15:32.480]  Right, and actually, a lot of people don't realize this.
[15:32.480 --> 15:37.480]  A lot of people have no clue how insanely popular
[15:38.120 --> 15:40.340]  and pervasive Business Insider is.
[15:41.280 --> 15:45.720]  Like, whenever I mention on Business Insider, any context,
[15:45.720 --> 15:49.560]  I will have everybody who has ever met me,
[15:49.560 --> 15:52.900]  my mom's friends, my friends' parents,
[15:52.900 --> 15:57.640]  like, people who are outside of the tech news sphere,
[15:57.640 --> 16:00.400]  they will all contact me and be like,
[16:00.400 --> 16:01.840]  oh my god, I read this article about you
[16:01.840 --> 16:03.880]  on Business Insider, you know, congratulations,
[16:03.880 --> 16:05.080]  or like, they considered it a good thing,
[16:05.080 --> 16:07.720]  whenever I mention there, even though it's always so trashy.
[16:09.800 --> 16:11.160]  Like, sometimes, like, one of my products
[16:11.160 --> 16:12.040]  will occasionally get mentioned
[16:12.040 --> 16:15.600]  in some major tech publication, like, you know, Mac World,
[16:15.600 --> 16:17.820]  or occasionally I've even been like in New York Times
[16:17.820 --> 16:19.920]  or Wall Street Journal or something like that.
[16:19.920 --> 16:21.800]  Never a peep from anybody.
[16:21.800 --> 16:23.640]  When I'm in Business Insider for the stupidest,
[16:23.640 --> 16:26.800]  smallest thing, everyone in my life comes forward,
[16:26.800 --> 16:29.000]  oh my god, I haven't seen you in 15 years,
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.580]  but I read this article about you in Business Insider.
[16:31.580 --> 16:34.520]  That site, like, I don't know why it's so popular,
[16:34.520 --> 16:36.920]  but it is really popular.
[16:36.920 --> 16:39.720]  And so, whenever they write anything about me
[16:39.720 --> 16:43.600]  or one of my products, it gets picked up everywhere,
[16:43.600 --> 16:45.220]  it gets carried everywhere,
[16:45.220 --> 16:47.660]  and they ultimately dictate the narrative.
[16:47.660 --> 16:50.120]  If you look, like, almost every other site
[16:50.120 --> 16:52.020]  that republished this article
[16:52.020 --> 16:54.000]  was republishing from Business Insider.
[16:54.000 --> 16:55.880]  A lot of them were linking back to Business Insider
[16:55.880 --> 16:57.840]  instead of my site, a lot of them were taking
[16:57.840 --> 17:00.680]  the Business Insider headlines and quotes word for word.
[17:00.680 --> 17:05.680]  It really was Business Insider that led the promotion
[17:05.760 --> 17:07.560]  on this, whether willingly or not.
[17:07.560 --> 17:08.700]  I don't know, it doesn't really matter,
[17:08.700 --> 17:11.620]  but people do not realize, like,
[17:11.620 --> 17:14.320]  your site seeds all the tech sites.
[17:14.320 --> 17:16.080]  Like, whenever you write about something,
[17:16.080 --> 17:17.900]  all the tech sites write about it a day later.
[17:17.900 --> 17:20.480]  Business Insider seeds everything else.
[17:20.480 --> 17:23.380]  It's really weird, and I wish it wasn't that way,
[17:23.380 --> 17:24.720]  but it really is.
[17:24.720 --> 17:27.980]  It's sort of the opposite of my sort of popularity.
[17:27.980 --> 17:30.960]  My popularity is super niche, and so, like,
[17:30.960 --> 17:32.980]  it is a big deal for some people.
[17:32.980 --> 17:34.200]  Like, if I link to somebody,
[17:34.200 --> 17:36.280]  first time I ever linked to their blog,
[17:36.280 --> 17:38.080]  a lot of people will, like, tweet to me, like,
[17:38.080 --> 17:39.520]  oh my god, you just made my day.
[17:39.520 --> 17:43.560]  And it's, that's hard for me, I don't,
[17:43.560 --> 17:45.720]  I'm still not, I can't say I'll ever get used to that,
[17:45.720 --> 17:47.880]  but I understand it, I know.
[17:47.880 --> 17:49.900]  I know what it was like, I know what it was like
[17:49.900 --> 17:52.920]  the first time that Slashdot linked to Daring Fireball
[17:52.920 --> 17:55.680]  way back in 2002, and it was just crazy.
[17:55.680 --> 17:57.380]  And it's not even that I loved Slashdot,
[17:57.380 --> 18:00.040]  but it's like, I knew that, holy shit, that's a big deal.
[18:00.040 --> 18:01.880]  Right, it was like getting on the dig front page
[18:01.880 --> 18:03.220]  back in 2006.
[18:03.220 --> 18:05.480]  Right, I also remember that my site didn't go down,
[18:05.480 --> 18:08.320]  and it was, you know, I thought, you know,
[18:08.320 --> 18:11.720]  up until that point, I had no idea whether, you know,
[18:11.720 --> 18:12.920]  there was no way for me to fake it.
[18:12.920 --> 18:15.960]  I couldn't, you know, know if I would survive a Slashdotting.
[18:17.800 --> 18:21.880]  But it, I don't think it, like, some guy, you know,
[18:21.880 --> 18:22.840]  somebody writes a blog post,
[18:22.840 --> 18:24.480]  I've never linked to them before I linked to them.
[18:24.480 --> 18:26.780]  They're not gonna get their mom calling them and say,
[18:26.780 --> 18:28.960]  hey, I saw a Daring Fireball link to you.
[18:28.960 --> 18:31.160]  Because their mom doesn't know who I am either.
[18:31.160 --> 18:32.820]  Unless their mom is really cool.
[18:32.820 --> 18:34.840]  Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, it would be an exception.
[18:34.840 --> 18:36.800]  It would have to be like, you know, like Brent Simmons,
[18:36.800 --> 18:38.520]  where his mom's like a programmer and stuff.
[18:38.520 --> 18:39.360]  Right, right.
[18:39.360 --> 18:40.680]  And I, you know, I shouldn't even say mom, you know,
[18:40.680 --> 18:43.040]  mom, dad, anybody who's not in the thing
[18:43.040 --> 18:44.640]  and is already one of my regular readers.
[18:44.640 --> 18:47.080]  Whereas Business Insider has a very, for whatever reason,
[18:47.080 --> 18:51.400]  has a very broad readership, like of typical people.
[18:51.400 --> 18:53.660]  Yeah, like what they write goes very far.
[18:54.560 --> 18:56.680]  Which is really unfortunate, because it's so bad usually.
[18:56.680 --> 18:58.440]  Yeah, it's something to do with, you know,
[18:58.440 --> 19:01.960]  that they're a certain brand of, I don't know,
[19:01.960 --> 19:03.440]  sensationalizing stuff.
[19:03.440 --> 19:06.800]  Well look, I mean, you know, there are things in the world
[19:06.800 --> 19:09.700]  that, like there are choices people can make,
[19:09.700 --> 19:13.920]  where you can do things like the good, high quality,
[19:13.920 --> 19:15.840]  morally sound way.
[19:15.840 --> 19:18.560]  Or, you take this one little shortcut here,
[19:18.560 --> 19:20.920]  if you're willing to give up a little bit of integrity here,
[19:20.920 --> 19:22.440]  or a little bit of sensationalism here,
[19:22.440 --> 19:25.840]  you can boost your numbers by 15, 20, 30%.
[19:25.840 --> 19:29.080]  And they choose the latter all the time.
[19:29.080 --> 19:31.880]  Like so, whereas you choose the former,
[19:31.880 --> 19:33.520]  and that's what we consider in our community
[19:33.520 --> 19:36.200]  to be like the right way to do it.
[19:36.200 --> 19:41.200]  If you're shameless enough, and if you prioritize numbers
[19:41.840 --> 19:46.440]  and success in that kind over integrity and quality,
[19:46.440 --> 19:50.040]  then you can get insane numbers and insane popularity,
[19:50.040 --> 19:52.040]  and they have chosen that.
[19:52.040 --> 19:53.940]  Yeah, and let's not overstate things here either.
[19:53.940 --> 19:55.720]  They're certainly not the worst.
[19:55.720 --> 19:58.400]  And the other thing too, they have talented people,
[19:58.400 --> 19:59.940]  and they have had talented people.
[19:59.940 --> 20:01.460]  Dan Fromer used to write there.
[20:01.460 --> 20:02.300]  Yeah, that's where I met him.
[20:02.300 --> 20:03.120]  I used to hate him.
[20:03.120 --> 20:04.280]  And then he came to the Tumblr offices,
[20:04.280 --> 20:06.380]  I met him there first, and then he left
[20:06.380 --> 20:08.820]  and became a normal, good person.
[20:08.820 --> 20:09.880]  It was amazing.
[20:09.880 --> 20:13.800]  And I know Jay Yarrow, who wrote this piece on you.
[20:13.800 --> 20:15.760]  He's good, he's smart.
[20:15.760 --> 20:19.160]  You could just tell from reading him on Twitter.
[20:19.160 --> 20:21.080]  Nick Carlson, who I think is his name,
[20:21.080 --> 20:23.800]  the guy who just published the book on Yahoo,
[20:23.800 --> 20:26.240]  and Marissa Meyer, he's a good reporter.
[20:27.120 --> 20:29.340]  He is, I'll give him that, yeah.
[20:29.340 --> 20:30.440]  And I think it's interesting too.
[20:30.440 --> 20:33.560]  I think the success he's having promoting his book,
[20:33.560 --> 20:35.880]  because it seems I'm reading a lot of stuff about his book.
[20:35.880 --> 20:37.740]  It's just popping up a lot of places.
[20:37.740 --> 20:39.780]  I think it just goes to show that at Business Insider,
[20:39.780 --> 20:42.780]  they're good at promoting stuff, including themselves.
[20:44.140 --> 20:46.400]  It's not just that they're, whether you're good, bad,
[20:46.400 --> 20:48.600]  or whatever, as a writer or reporter,
[20:49.640 --> 20:52.060]  being able to self-promote is a skill.
[20:52.060 --> 20:55.360]  And that, to me, is a big part of their success.
[20:55.360 --> 20:57.520]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[20:57.520 --> 20:59.300]  And Henry Blodgett's always had that too,
[20:59.300 --> 21:01.100]  founder of the site.
[21:01.100 --> 21:03.000]  Among some other issues, but that's fine.
[21:03.000 --> 21:03.840]  Right.
[21:06.360 --> 21:07.760]  But that's a definite thing though.
[21:07.760 --> 21:09.560]  It's like there's certain people,
[21:10.460 --> 21:12.360]  he's good at getting on TV,
[21:12.360 --> 21:14.740]  and there's that certain type of Wall Street person
[21:14.740 --> 21:18.680]  who just goes on CNBC all the time.
[21:18.680 --> 21:19.880]  And it would drive me nuts.
[21:19.880 --> 21:21.580]  I would hate going on TV.
[21:21.580 --> 21:24.560]  I don't think I'd wanna go on once.
[21:24.560 --> 21:27.600]  I can't imagine the amount of stress that would bring.
[21:28.920 --> 21:31.120]  I would definitely, if I was ever invited,
[21:31.120 --> 21:32.460]  I would definitely decline.
[21:32.460 --> 21:34.840]  I've had invitations many times, and I almost don't.
[21:34.840 --> 21:36.480]  I mean, I went on Charlie Rose that one time,
[21:36.480 --> 21:37.320]  and that was cool.
[21:37.320 --> 21:38.680]  And it was also pretty easy,
[21:38.680 --> 21:40.980]  because it was like five in the afternoon,
[21:40.980 --> 21:43.780]  getting to New York at five in the afternoon is super easy.
[21:43.780 --> 21:46.140]  I just take a one o'clock train from Philly,
[21:46.140 --> 21:48.040]  and I like going to Manhattan anyway.
[21:48.040 --> 21:50.080]  So that was cool, and I had a blast,
[21:50.080 --> 21:52.320]  and it was well worth, you know,
[21:52.320 --> 21:54.920]  it wasn't that much of a time commitment.
[21:56.240 --> 21:58.680]  But I've had offers to go on Bloomberg TV,
[21:58.680 --> 22:00.760]  and it's like, they want me in New York
[22:00.760 --> 22:03.340]  by like five a.m. Eastern.
[22:03.340 --> 22:05.760]  And it's like, no, it's not gonna work.
[22:05.760 --> 22:08.480]  But it really doesn't compute with them
[22:08.480 --> 22:10.800]  that somebody would not wanna be on TV.
[22:10.800 --> 22:14.940]  People who are in TV seem to be people who've,
[22:14.940 --> 22:17.000]  whether they're on the air or not,
[22:17.000 --> 22:20.000]  or whether they're just working as a producer or whatever,
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.960]  it seems like the TV industry is only composed of people
[22:22.960 --> 22:23.960]  who've spent their whole lives
[22:23.960 --> 22:26.000]  wanting to be in the TV industry.
[22:26.000 --> 22:27.960]  And they can't, it just doesn't compute.
[22:27.960 --> 22:30.520]  It doesn't, they can't grasp it when I say,
[22:30.520 --> 22:33.040]  you know, I really don't think I ever wanna be on your show.
[22:33.040 --> 22:34.300]  Thanks for asking, I'm flattered.
[22:34.300 --> 22:37.160]  But, you know, being in New York by five a.m.
[22:37.160 --> 22:39.140]  is not gonna work.
[22:39.140 --> 22:42.640]  Well, also, like, it's similar to the whole like,
[22:42.640 --> 22:44.800]  you know, you should do this for exposure kind of arguments.
[22:44.800 --> 22:47.000]  Like, a lot of times they don't,
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.240]  they can't imagine why anybody would say no
[22:49.240 --> 22:51.560]  to this great honor that they're bestowing upon you.
[22:51.560 --> 22:54.660]  And the fact is, like, there's a cost to you being on TV,
[22:54.660 --> 22:57.000]  and there's risks to you being on TV,
[22:57.000 --> 22:58.880]  and it just might not be worth it.
[22:58.880 --> 23:00.560]  Like, that's how, like, you know,
[23:00.560 --> 23:03.040]  I'm realizing as I'm getting older,
[23:03.040 --> 23:05.680]  and hopefully wiser, but I keep making the same mistakes
[23:05.680 --> 23:07.300]  over and over again, so probably not wiser,
[23:07.300 --> 23:08.680]  but as I at least get older,
[23:08.680 --> 23:11.800]  I'm realizing that, like, talking to journalists
[23:11.800 --> 23:14.120]  for interviews, for stories about, you know, anything,
[23:14.120 --> 23:16.840]  like, when they call you for a quote or anything,
[23:16.840 --> 23:20.280]  like, it is almost never worth agreeing to that,
[23:20.280 --> 23:22.120]  because the risk is so high
[23:22.120 --> 23:24.520]  that they're going to distort your words
[23:24.520 --> 23:27.660]  to fit their narrative in a way that you don't approve of,
[23:27.660 --> 23:29.920]  that you can't, that's totally out of your control.
[23:29.920 --> 23:31.680]  And it's like, in this day and age,
[23:31.680 --> 23:34.840]  like, if I have something to say, I can say it on my blog.
[23:34.840 --> 23:36.400]  Now, granted, now that has the other problem,
[23:36.400 --> 23:37.540]  which just happened, which is like,
[23:37.540 --> 23:40.040]  I better be sure I say it well there,
[23:40.040 --> 23:42.340]  and everything I write there can be taken
[23:42.340 --> 23:44.960]  and quoted elsewhere, but at least I wrote it my way.
[23:44.960 --> 23:48.320]  Like, it seems like less of a risk to do it that way
[23:48.320 --> 23:51.000]  than, like, to just be quoted in some random news story
[23:51.000 --> 23:53.840]  and, like, you have no control over that.
[23:53.840 --> 23:56.440]  You usually, unless you have a very strong relationship
[23:56.440 --> 23:59.040]  with them, usually you can't get, like, quote review
[23:59.040 --> 24:01.960]  or anything, and if somebody screws up
[24:01.960 --> 24:03.520]  and publishes something that you didn't quite say,
[24:03.520 --> 24:05.800]  there's pretty much nothing you can do about it.
[24:05.800 --> 24:08.480]  Even if they publish a correction, the damage is done.
[24:08.480 --> 24:12.100]  So it's, like, and going on TV is probably even worse,
[24:12.100 --> 24:15.320]  because, like, you're live, like, you can't even carefully
[24:15.320 --> 24:16.800]  think about your words for very long.
[24:16.800 --> 24:19.500]  Like, you're live, you need to get a comment right now
[24:19.500 --> 24:22.840]  and try to sound smart, and it just,
[24:22.840 --> 24:24.800]  and everyone's watching, you know?
[24:24.800 --> 24:27.100]  Yeah, and it's also, it's not leisurely.
[24:27.100 --> 24:27.940]  Yeah, exactly.
[24:27.940 --> 24:31.520]  I think I, it's funny, I was gonna say,
[24:31.520 --> 24:33.360]  I think I did pretty well on Charlie Rose,
[24:33.360 --> 24:36.220]  but they've never asked me back, so maybe not.
[24:36.220 --> 24:37.480]  I remember, I think I watched it.
[24:37.480 --> 24:38.920]  I remember just, like, you know,
[24:38.920 --> 24:40.420]  I think I immediately forgot about it,
[24:40.420 --> 24:42.000]  so it couldn't have been good or bad, really.
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.440]  It was me and David Pogue talking
[24:44.440 --> 24:48.400]  about the iPhone 5, I wanna say?
[24:48.400 --> 24:50.720]  Like, I'm gonna place it two years ago.
[24:50.720 --> 24:52.280]  Pretty sure it was iPhone 5.
[24:52.280 --> 24:54.560]  Well, you probably did exactly what you,
[24:54.560 --> 24:56.300]  what is, like, the optimal scenario
[24:56.300 --> 24:57.600]  for a TV appearance like that,
[24:57.600 --> 25:01.280]  which is be good but completely forgettable,
[25:01.280 --> 25:03.080]  because we all forgot it.
[25:03.080 --> 25:06.520]  And that's good, because, like, it could go a lot worse.
[25:06.520 --> 25:08.420]  It can't really go much better.
[25:08.420 --> 25:10.600]  And so, like, that's, that's,
[25:10.600 --> 25:12.160]  and then, and now you can say, I've been
[25:12.160 --> 25:14.460]  on the Charlie Rose show, you can tell your parents,
[25:14.460 --> 25:16.640]  they can see it, like, it's all good.
[25:16.640 --> 25:20.120]  So you have all the benefits, but nothing went wrong.
[25:20.120 --> 25:24.300]  Sitting in a chair that was warmed by Matt Damon's ass.
[25:24.300 --> 25:25.140]  Is that an honor?
[25:25.140 --> 25:26.080]  I'm not sure.
[25:26.080 --> 25:27.080]  I don't know, it's pretty cool, though,
[25:27.080 --> 25:28.920]  walking into a room as he walks out.
[25:30.480 --> 25:33.800]  Did you stop by and say, hey, hey, I licked your site, man.
[25:33.800 --> 25:36.080]  Yeah, yeah, he was, he wanted a T-shirt.
[25:36.080 --> 25:37.060]  Sure he's a reader.
[25:37.060 --> 25:39.280]  No, I learned what to do in that scenario
[25:39.280 --> 25:42.000]  from Merlin Mann.
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.120]  It's such great advice, that you just have to,
[25:44.120 --> 25:46.640]  you have to know this before, just think about it now,
[25:46.640 --> 25:48.160]  before when there's no famous people around.
[25:48.160 --> 25:51.760]  And if you ever meet somebody who's famous, truly famous,
[25:51.760 --> 25:53.520]  and you're gonna get a chance to say something,
[25:53.520 --> 25:56.520]  all you say is, huge fan of your work.
[25:57.420 --> 25:58.980]  Oh, that's good, Merlin's so good.
[25:58.980 --> 26:01.000]  You just say, huge fan of your work, and you mean it.
[26:01.000 --> 26:02.360]  You know, don't say it if you don't mean it.
[26:02.360 --> 26:04.240]  Just look at him and say, hey, great to meet you,
[26:04.240 --> 26:06.400]  a huge, huge fan of your work.
[26:06.400 --> 26:08.040]  And then that's it, you just, and then you let him go.
[26:08.040 --> 26:10.600]  He just, maybe neither, I think with Damon,
[26:10.600 --> 26:12.700]  we didn't even stop walking.
[26:12.700 --> 26:14.280]  But it was, you know, there was a moment,
[26:14.280 --> 26:15.520]  I could say something, I just said,
[26:15.520 --> 26:17.360]  hey, huge fan of your work.
[26:17.360 --> 26:20.880]  And he goes, thanks, and then he left.
[26:20.880 --> 26:23.440]  See, and you have that story too, so it worked out.
[26:23.440 --> 26:24.260]  All right.
[26:27.240 --> 26:29.540]  Yeah, and anyway, what you said is exactly right, though,
[26:29.540 --> 26:31.280]  about talking to reporters, where,
[26:31.280 --> 26:32.640]  and it's definitely my experience,
[26:32.640 --> 26:35.720]  where almost all of them have the story written,
[26:35.720 --> 26:37.160]  whether it's actually written, written,
[26:37.160 --> 26:39.920]  or it's just like an outline in their head,
[26:39.920 --> 26:41.060]  they've already got it written,
[26:41.060 --> 26:43.320]  and they will take your quote and make it fit
[26:43.320 --> 26:45.720]  what they've already written, nine times out of 10.
[26:45.720 --> 26:47.520]  So I don't talk to reporters anymore either,
[26:47.520 --> 26:49.600]  unless I know them, unless I know,
[26:49.600 --> 26:50.520]  either know them personally,
[26:50.520 --> 26:54.200]  or if I'm familiar with their work, and trust them.
[26:54.200 --> 26:55.600]  Yeah, and you know, it's different
[26:55.600 --> 26:57.160]  when you know them personally, you know,
[26:57.160 --> 26:58.560]  and I'll talk to people I know,
[26:58.560 --> 27:01.480]  but that's a pretty small list, really.
[27:01.480 --> 27:04.600]  Yeah, or just, you know, just familiar with their work.
[27:04.600 --> 27:08.040]  But yeah, again, but Joe Schmo from Bloomberg, no way.
[27:08.040 --> 27:10.040]  Not a, yeah, terrible idea.
[27:10.040 --> 27:12.620]  It can only go badly, and it probably will.
[27:12.620 --> 27:13.460]  Right.
[27:14.720 --> 27:16.160]  I almost worked there.
[27:16.160 --> 27:17.000]  At Bloomberg?
[27:17.000 --> 27:18.500]  Yeah, when I was interviewing
[27:18.500 --> 27:20.800]  for what became the Tumblr job,
[27:20.800 --> 27:22.600]  that was, I was weighing those two offers.
[27:22.600 --> 27:23.900]  I had gotten an offer from both,
[27:23.900 --> 27:25.480]  I interviewed at both places,
[27:25.480 --> 27:28.920]  and I got to choose between Bloomberg
[27:28.920 --> 27:30.200]  and this giant glass building
[27:30.200 --> 27:32.600]  where all the walls inside were glass,
[27:32.600 --> 27:33.520]  and this caused problems
[27:33.520 --> 27:34.840]  because you couldn't see how to exit
[27:34.840 --> 27:36.960]  the conference room you were in.
[27:36.960 --> 27:38.280]  There's like optical illusions everywhere,
[27:38.280 --> 27:43.280]  and they told me they had to add this like row of stickers
[27:43.440 --> 27:45.140]  that were like, just like the company logo,
[27:45.140 --> 27:47.040]  this row of decals on every wall
[27:47.040 --> 27:49.000]  at approximately eye level,
[27:49.000 --> 27:50.960]  just so you wouldn't like run into things,
[27:50.960 --> 27:52.060]  like run into walls.
[27:53.120 --> 27:54.680]  You know, a typical corporate design
[27:54.680 --> 27:57.400]  of like, it looks really cool, it doesn't work at all.
[27:57.400 --> 27:59.720]  And so I get to weigh that,
[27:59.720 --> 28:01.140]  of crashing into glass walls,
[28:01.140 --> 28:04.320]  and sitting in a very long table
[28:04.320 --> 28:08.160]  with about four feet of width of the table assigned to me,
[28:08.160 --> 28:11.280]  a little six inch rim around the desk,
[28:11.280 --> 28:12.120]  like not even cubicle wall,
[28:12.120 --> 28:15.320]  it's like a six inch rim around my little four foot space,
[28:15.320 --> 28:19.400]  typing on a PC, working on Fortran code.
[28:19.400 --> 28:20.240]  No.
[28:20.240 --> 28:22.240]  Or, yeah, yeah, that was the job.
[28:22.240 --> 28:23.080]  Really?
[28:23.080 --> 28:27.000]  And everyone I interviewed with was not that nice,
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.200]  and I thought I bombed the interview.
[28:29.200 --> 28:32.240]  And so I got an offer for an interview
[28:32.240 --> 28:33.620]  that I thought I bombed,
[28:33.620 --> 28:35.840]  from people I don't really wanna work with,
[28:35.840 --> 28:37.560]  in this terrible environment,
[28:37.560 --> 28:39.760]  like this giant boiler room kind of environment,
[28:39.760 --> 28:41.280]  just like this little strip of a desk
[28:41.280 --> 28:43.000]  with a Fortran terminal.
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.280]  Or, I could go work for this guy
[28:45.280 --> 28:48.960]  who looks like he's 15, David Karp,
[28:48.960 --> 28:50.740]  and he's working out of some office
[28:50.740 --> 28:51.880]  that I don't quite understand
[28:51.880 --> 28:52.840]  that a bunch of other people are in,
[28:52.840 --> 28:54.380]  but he doesn't work for them.
[28:54.380 --> 28:55.220]  There's some arrangement
[28:55.220 --> 28:56.360]  where they're sharing the office or something.
[28:56.360 --> 28:57.600]  Everything is red and colorful,
[28:57.600 --> 28:59.760]  and the office is full of children's toys.
[28:59.760 --> 29:02.200]  And he told me that he'd buy me a Mac
[29:02.200 --> 29:04.520]  and I could work on a Mac.
[29:04.520 --> 29:05.520]  So I went with that.
[29:06.560 --> 29:08.600]  That was literally like why I went there.
[29:08.600 --> 29:10.320]  I can't believe they've still got Fortran code
[29:10.320 --> 29:11.220]  in production.
[29:11.220 --> 29:12.720]  I mean, that was literally a joke on,
[29:12.720 --> 29:15.080]  I think it was this week's Simpsons.
[29:15.080 --> 29:17.320]  No, I actually, I was recently,
[29:17.320 --> 29:18.680]  I was on a flight recently,
[29:18.680 --> 29:21.560]  sitting next to a guy who works for IBM.
[29:21.560 --> 29:22.460]  And he was a young guy.
[29:22.460 --> 29:24.560]  He was in his probably mid-20s.
[29:24.560 --> 29:28.640]  But he works in IBM's mainframe division,
[29:28.640 --> 29:29.960]  which is still running.
[29:29.960 --> 29:32.200]  And there's big banks and insurance companies
[29:32.200 --> 29:35.200]  and things like, they still use IBM mainframes.
[29:35.200 --> 29:37.680]  And he writes all in Fortran or,
[29:37.680 --> 29:40.040]  no, I think it was COBOL, one of those two.
[29:40.040 --> 29:41.520]  That's what he does all day,
[29:41.520 --> 29:45.160]  is write low-level mainframe operating system code
[29:45.160 --> 29:47.280]  in COBOL or Fortran.
[29:47.280 --> 29:48.560]  Yeah, that's crazy.
[29:48.560 --> 29:50.820]  And he's, I mean, he wasn't even born
[29:50.820 --> 29:53.400]  when this thing was originally written.
[29:53.400 --> 29:54.720]  I feel bad, because there's probably people
[29:54.720 --> 29:56.880]  who listen to the show who have a job like that.
[29:56.880 --> 29:57.720]  Oh, I'm sure.
[29:57.720 --> 29:59.120]  It's more common than you think.
[29:59.120 --> 30:00.020]  That's the crazy part.
[30:00.020 --> 30:01.360]  Yeah, I don't really want to make fun.
[30:01.360 --> 30:02.520]  I'm not trying to make fun.
[30:02.520 --> 30:05.200]  I'm just sort of stunned that there's that much,
[30:08.440 --> 30:09.280]  what would you call it?
[30:09.280 --> 30:11.800]  Like inertia with programming languages.
[30:11.800 --> 30:14.280]  That they just, once they get any kind of mass success,
[30:14.280 --> 30:16.000]  they just never die.
[30:16.000 --> 30:16.920]  Well, in a system like that,
[30:16.920 --> 30:18.360]  I mean, if you think about it like,
[30:18.360 --> 30:22.160]  from like a programmer out of college viewpoint,
[30:22.160 --> 30:24.600]  and you think, why are you using Fortran
[30:24.600 --> 30:26.360]  for your bank's large systems?
[30:26.360 --> 30:27.180]  You're stupid.
[30:27.180 --> 30:28.020]  That's dumb.
[30:28.020 --> 30:30.600]  I want to rewrite this whole thing in Node or whatever.
[30:30.600 --> 30:33.080]  And then, you know, but the reality is like,
[30:33.080 --> 30:35.020]  the wise programmer would look at that and be like,
[30:35.020 --> 30:38.820]  all right, this bank's massive financial backend
[30:38.820 --> 30:41.000]  that has been running fine for the most part
[30:41.000 --> 30:44.940]  for like 30 years is written in some crazy language.
[30:44.940 --> 30:48.100]  Do I want the job of rewriting it from scratch?
[30:48.100 --> 30:48.940]  Hell no.
[30:48.940 --> 30:52.040]  Like that's, that has red flags all over it.
[30:52.040 --> 30:54.080]  You do not want that kind of responsibility.
[30:54.080 --> 30:54.960]  Get out of there.
[30:54.960 --> 30:56.200]  Like, I don't know,
[30:56.200 --> 30:59.920]  I don't know any wise programmers who would take that job.
[30:59.920 --> 31:02.160]  It's instead of if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[31:02.160 --> 31:04.440]  If it ain't broke, don't rewrite it.
[31:04.440 --> 31:05.640]  And certainly don't touch it
[31:05.640 --> 31:07.840]  when there's like massive amounts of money at stake.
[31:07.840 --> 31:09.200]  Right.
[31:09.200 --> 31:10.680]  Crazy.
[31:10.680 --> 31:11.500]  Let's take a break.
[31:11.500 --> 31:12.340]  I'll do the first sponsor.
[31:12.340 --> 31:16.200]  And it is our good friends at Fracture.
[31:16.200 --> 31:17.560]  You guys remember Fracture?
[31:18.760 --> 31:21.080]  You send them your photos
[31:21.080 --> 31:25.120]  and they send them back to you printed directly on glass.
[31:26.440 --> 31:30.440]  Not paper with a piece of glass in front of it in the frame.
[31:30.440 --> 31:32.480]  The picture is printed right on the glass.
[31:32.480 --> 31:34.420]  I've never seen anything else like it.
[31:35.260 --> 31:37.680]  You really do kind of have to see it to believe it.
[31:37.680 --> 31:39.180]  It really makes it seem as though
[31:39.180 --> 31:40.520]  it's right there on the surface.
[31:40.520 --> 31:43.080]  I always compare it to like when the iPhone switched
[31:43.080 --> 31:46.020]  to the laminated displays,
[31:46.020 --> 31:48.700]  putting the pixels closer to the glass.
[31:48.700 --> 31:50.100]  It's exactly that sort of effect,
[31:50.100 --> 31:53.800]  but with an analog print of your photos.
[31:53.800 --> 31:56.680]  They have all sorts of sizes to choose from.
[31:56.680 --> 31:58.640]  The square ones that Marco has made famous
[31:58.640 --> 32:00.520]  for printing your app icons for
[32:00.520 --> 32:01.960]  every time he sells an app to somebody,
[32:01.960 --> 32:04.560]  he makes a copy.
[32:04.560 --> 32:05.400]  Looks really nice.
[32:05.400 --> 32:06.720]  I've been in Marco's office.
[32:06.720 --> 32:08.720]  They look great on the wall.
[32:08.720 --> 32:10.320]  Two really, really big ones,
[32:10.320 --> 32:11.560]  big rectangular ones.
[32:12.680 --> 32:15.040]  They ship in these amazing containers
[32:15.040 --> 32:18.400]  that double as like the frame that you can use
[32:18.400 --> 32:23.320]  to hang on the wall or to put on your desk propped up
[32:23.320 --> 32:26.040]  right there in this nifty cardboard shipping container.
[32:26.040 --> 32:28.560]  You don't have to buy an extra frame to put the thing in.
[32:28.560 --> 32:31.040]  You can mount them directly on the wall just as the glass.
[32:31.040 --> 32:32.300]  They look really cool.
[32:33.480 --> 32:34.760]  So there's nothing else to buy.
[32:34.760 --> 32:36.160]  It's not like when you get printouts
[32:36.160 --> 32:38.260]  and then you have to go put them in a frame
[32:38.260 --> 32:40.560]  and you have to take the frame apart
[32:40.560 --> 32:42.400]  and then it's easy, so easy.
[32:42.400 --> 32:43.860]  You just send them your pictures.
[32:43.860 --> 32:48.440]  They send you back printouts of them on glass.
[32:50.280 --> 32:51.400]  Where do you go to find out more?
[32:51.400 --> 32:54.240]  Go to their website, fracture,
[32:54.240 --> 32:55.880]  I think it's fractureme.com.
[32:55.880 --> 32:56.720]  That's correct.
[32:57.920 --> 33:00.020]  And there's a new coupon code.
[33:00.020 --> 33:03.560]  Use this code, daringfireball, all one word,
[33:03.560 --> 33:08.040]  and you will save 15% on whatever you order.
[33:08.040 --> 33:09.040]  So that's great.
[33:09.040 --> 33:10.580]  The prices are already fantastic.
[33:10.580 --> 33:14.000]  Save 15% though, use that code daringfireball
[33:14.000 --> 33:18.300]  and go to fractureme.com and see for yourself.
[33:20.240 --> 33:23.080]  Great sponsor, really, really recommend them.
[33:23.080 --> 33:26.240]  Yeah, I'm looking right at five fracture prints
[33:26.240 --> 33:27.280]  in my office right now.
[33:27.280 --> 33:29.880]  Oh my God, we have them all over the place.
[33:29.880 --> 33:31.520]  And it's a great gift idea too.
[33:34.920 --> 33:37.620]  So I don't know, the immediate backlash, not backlash,
[33:37.620 --> 33:42.620]  over, over, over representation of your thing
[33:43.640 --> 33:45.520]  is kind of interesting and it's sad and depressing.
[33:45.520 --> 33:47.980]  But I feel like the better topic is to actually talk
[33:47.980 --> 33:51.580]  about some of the problems Apple software has.
[33:51.580 --> 33:52.420]  Yeah, sure.
[33:52.420 --> 33:54.960]  Because one of the things I got is it definitely,
[33:54.960 --> 33:58.500]  because it hits such a mainstream media thing.
[33:58.500 --> 34:00.540]  I mean, people within Apple definitely noticed.
[34:00.540 --> 34:04.640]  And I heard from a couple of friends at Apple,
[34:04.640 --> 34:07.920]  not like PR, not like Apple PR reaching out and telling me,
[34:07.920 --> 34:11.120]  trying to spin it or anything, just like engineers.
[34:11.120 --> 34:15.000]  And some of them, it was really interesting what they said.
[34:15.000 --> 34:15.940]  All of them said different things,
[34:15.940 --> 34:17.840]  but like one of them was pretty surprised
[34:17.840 --> 34:20.060]  and more or less of, do you really think that?
[34:20.060 --> 34:24.180]  Because I, this is the friend at Apple's,
[34:24.180 --> 34:27.900]  more or less paraphrase, that I think
[34:27.900 --> 34:29.500]  that we've been doing pretty good.
[34:29.500 --> 34:33.260]  It seems to me like the bug, the open bugs in radar
[34:33.260 --> 34:35.540]  are lower than they used to be years ago.
[34:36.900 --> 34:37.740]  Do you really think that?
[34:37.740 --> 34:39.900]  And I said, I have to say, there is something to it though.
[34:39.900 --> 34:42.780]  It seems to me like there's more annoyances
[34:42.780 --> 34:44.260]  than there used to be.
[34:44.260 --> 34:45.740]  But there were definitely some people within Apple
[34:45.740 --> 34:48.760]  who disagreed and then there were some who did agree.
[34:50.980 --> 34:53.100]  But I'm curious, I'm curious specifically,
[34:53.100 --> 34:54.460]  because that's one thing your article didn't have,
[34:54.460 --> 34:55.860]  is it didn't really have like a list
[34:55.860 --> 34:57.500]  of here's some of the bugs.
[34:57.500 --> 35:01.300]  Right, and that was ultimately a failing.
[35:01.300 --> 35:03.340]  I wasn't really talking about like,
[35:03.340 --> 35:07.360]  here's five things that are the problems today.
[35:07.360 --> 35:08.980]  I was really talking about the general trend.
[35:08.980 --> 35:12.100]  And so it's hard to give a comprehensive list of examples
[35:12.100 --> 35:15.140]  because many of these things are like little annoyances
[35:15.140 --> 35:18.900]  or little occasional failures or occasional bugs.
[35:20.480 --> 35:23.140]  I heard from a few different engineers
[35:23.140 --> 35:26.580]  and I read a couple of Reddit comments
[35:26.580 --> 35:29.960]  from people who are allegedly within Apple and stuff.
[35:29.960 --> 35:34.540]  And it seems to be a few people thought
[35:34.540 --> 35:35.940]  that everything's fine,
[35:35.940 --> 35:39.660]  but most of the people seem to think that, yeah,
[35:39.660 --> 35:41.980]  like finally, thank you for saying this,
[35:41.980 --> 35:42.940]  like that kind of attitude.
[35:42.940 --> 35:45.300]  Like, yes, this is like, no one listens,
[35:45.300 --> 35:46.340]  that kind of thing.
[35:46.340 --> 35:48.780]  And it's hard to get a read on what the truth is
[35:48.780 --> 35:50.760]  or even know if these people are the real people
[35:50.760 --> 35:53.420]  who actually work at Apple, who knows?
[35:53.420 --> 35:55.580]  It could have just been some random person on the internet.
[35:55.580 --> 35:59.700]  But I think there's like your comment about like,
[35:59.700 --> 36:00.940]  you know, the number of radars,
[36:00.940 --> 36:05.060]  like Apple could be measuring things
[36:05.060 --> 36:10.060]  that don't reflect the overall usage of annoyances
[36:10.140 --> 36:12.660]  and bugs that actually hit people in real life.
[36:12.660 --> 36:14.660]  They could just be measuring the wrong things
[36:14.660 --> 36:16.780]  or the things they're measuring aren't changing.
[36:16.780 --> 36:20.360]  And so for instance, they have the built-in crash reporter
[36:20.360 --> 36:23.000]  in every recent version of every OS
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.540]  that you can say automatically send diagnostics to Apple
[36:25.540 --> 36:27.640]  when stuff breaks.
[36:27.640 --> 36:32.160]  But that only will send a report if a crash happened.
[36:32.160 --> 36:35.360]  Like if you hit a bug that wasn't a crash,
[36:35.360 --> 36:38.020]  that's not gonna include that.
[36:38.020 --> 36:42.140]  And most of the bugs I see recently aren't crashes.
[36:42.140 --> 36:44.980]  Like I'm not getting kernel panics at my computers,
[36:44.980 --> 36:46.960]  you know, or, you know, back when I was,
[36:46.960 --> 36:49.840]  that was the fault of some IO driver, you know?
[36:49.840 --> 36:51.260]  Yeah, and that's one of the things I heard
[36:51.260 --> 36:53.800]  from one of the people who was sort of
[36:53.800 --> 36:55.800]  not really believing in that.
[36:55.800 --> 36:58.980]  It was that specifically that crashes are down.
[36:58.980 --> 37:00.980]  You know, and that's something that they can measure
[37:00.980 --> 37:02.340]  because they have the crash reporter
[37:02.340 --> 37:07.340]  and that it just made him surprised that this was a thing.
[37:08.700 --> 37:12.640]  And it really was, it was not like a defensive take.
[37:12.640 --> 37:14.980]  It's like typical Apple person, very thoughtful.
[37:15.840 --> 37:17.740]  Really, really genuinely curious
[37:17.740 --> 37:19.620]  because he found it surprising.
[37:19.620 --> 37:23.600]  Really wanted to know, and also absolutely believed
[37:23.600 --> 37:26.680]  in the sort of, hey, when there's smoke, there's fire.
[37:26.680 --> 37:29.720]  You know, clearly this, Marco's post resonated
[37:29.720 --> 37:30.720]  with a lot of people.
[37:30.720 --> 37:34.500]  So I wanna get to the bottom of, you know, what this is.
[37:34.500 --> 37:36.100]  But crashes definitely aren't it.
[37:36.100 --> 37:39.200]  Exactly, and like earlier tonight,
[37:39.200 --> 37:42.360]  one of the many annoyances when using an Apple TV,
[37:43.680 --> 37:45.660]  you know, I turn on the Apple TV
[37:45.660 --> 37:48.360]  after it being asleep for most of the day,
[37:48.360 --> 37:51.500]  and it shows three prompts in a row that say
[37:51.500 --> 37:53.520]  your Apple TV is not gonna connect to the internet.
[37:53.520 --> 37:55.240]  Like you hit menu and just shows you another one.
[37:55.240 --> 37:57.280]  And like, so there's three of those that were queued up.
[37:57.280 --> 38:00.000]  So those aren't being coalesced.
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.700]  And then I go back to the home screen
[38:02.700 --> 38:04.520]  and it is connected to the internet
[38:04.520 --> 38:05.760]  and showing new stuff.
[38:05.760 --> 38:08.120]  So they were out of date and weren't canceled.
[38:08.120 --> 38:09.200]  Right, at which point those things
[38:09.200 --> 38:11.360]  should have been disregarded anyway.
[38:11.360 --> 38:13.320]  Nevermind it, right, file under nevermind.
[38:13.320 --> 38:15.480]  Right, why were they even showing when it was asleep
[38:15.480 --> 38:17.080]  and nobody was trying to do anything with it?
[38:17.080 --> 38:18.640]  Good question there too.
[38:18.640 --> 38:20.280]  So those are all quality issues, right?
[38:20.280 --> 38:23.200]  Not crashes, they're not gonna show up in any bug reports
[38:23.200 --> 38:24.280]  because I'm not gonna report it.
[38:24.280 --> 38:25.440]  Look, I'm talking with you,
[38:25.440 --> 38:27.320]  I'm not gonna report that on radar.
[38:27.320 --> 38:29.000]  Like it's not worth the time to even type it up
[38:29.000 --> 38:30.500]  and go through all the forms.
[38:31.920 --> 38:34.640]  Then I hit menu a couple times
[38:34.640 --> 38:37.240]  to get out of the like deep hierarchy
[38:37.240 --> 38:38.960]  of the movie structure I was in
[38:38.960 --> 38:40.020]  to get back to the home screen.
[38:40.020 --> 38:42.620]  I know you can just hold it down, but I didn't.
[38:42.620 --> 38:45.720]  The first time I hit it, it went boop and it did its thing.
[38:45.720 --> 38:46.880]  And then the second time I hit it,
[38:46.880 --> 38:48.480]  it just went boop, boop, boop, boop,
[38:48.480 --> 38:50.720]  and I kept hitting it and nothing was happening.
[38:50.720 --> 38:52.120]  And all the clicks just queued up
[38:52.120 --> 38:53.800]  and queued up and queued up and nothing happened.
[38:53.800 --> 38:56.000]  And I'm like, all right, do I reset it?
[38:56.000 --> 38:58.960]  And then like 30 seconds later, it executes all of them,
[38:58.960 --> 39:00.280]  like because they had all queued up.
[39:00.280 --> 39:01.680]  So everything's moving around like crazy.
[39:01.680 --> 39:05.120]  I'm like, no, no, no, no, that's not what I wanted.
[39:05.120 --> 39:06.680]  Again, another bug.
[39:06.680 --> 39:09.480]  Two nights ago, I had to actually unplug it
[39:09.480 --> 39:11.880]  and plug it back in to get it to respond
[39:11.880 --> 39:13.820]  to any remote commands.
[39:13.820 --> 39:15.400]  I tried two different remotes.
[39:15.400 --> 39:17.160]  We have multiple Apple TVs in the house.
[39:17.160 --> 39:18.640]  They both have similar bugs.
[39:18.640 --> 39:21.120]  So I know it's not just one of them being like dying
[39:21.120 --> 39:24.080]  or flaky, and I know, I mean,
[39:24.080 --> 39:25.800]  certainly Merlin has talked a lot
[39:25.800 --> 39:27.560]  about his Apple TV issues too,
[39:27.560 --> 39:29.640]  that there's issues with authenticating content.
[39:29.640 --> 39:32.600]  He's like the Jeffrey Zeldman of Apple TV,
[39:32.600 --> 39:34.520]  you know, like the way that Zeldman,
[39:34.520 --> 39:36.920]  Zeldman just has the worst Murphy's law luck
[39:36.920 --> 39:38.000]  with anything technology.
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.920]  Like Merlin clearly has caught
[39:40.920 --> 39:44.360]  like the Apple TV branch of that syndrome.
[39:44.360 --> 39:45.200]  Right, exactly.
[39:45.200 --> 39:47.360]  And I don't think that's uncommon, you know,
[39:47.360 --> 39:51.240]  and like, you know, I so often like will go to watch a movie
[39:51.240 --> 39:53.640]  and it'll sit there on authorizing forever
[39:53.640 --> 39:55.320]  and then eventually fail.
[39:55.320 --> 39:57.360]  And it's really like, come on, I bought this.
[39:57.360 --> 39:58.320]  These are movies we bought.
[39:58.320 --> 40:00.160]  My kid is like sitting down.
[40:00.160 --> 40:01.160]  He wants to watch something.
[40:01.160 --> 40:02.480]  If it doesn't show him in a minute,
[40:02.480 --> 40:04.320]  he's gonna start getting antsy and possibly scream.
[40:04.320 --> 40:06.620]  Like, come on, just come on, work.
[40:06.620 --> 40:10.200]  That's all like, and this is just the Apple TV, right?
[40:10.200 --> 40:13.520]  And airplay to the Apple TV works
[40:13.520 --> 40:15.680]  about a quarter of the time.
[40:15.680 --> 40:16.840]  And it doesn't work.
[40:16.840 --> 40:18.680]  I can vouch for the fact that it doesn't work
[40:18.680 --> 40:21.760]  with a two or three year old to try to explain
[40:21.760 --> 40:24.520]  how in the old days, we'd have to get in the car
[40:24.520 --> 40:27.720]  and drive to Blockbuster and the disc might be scratched.
[40:27.720 --> 40:28.880]  Right, yeah, exactly.
[40:28.880 --> 40:31.360]  Yeah, kids don't wanna hear it.
[40:31.360 --> 40:33.600]  Kids expect the thing that they see on the screen
[40:33.600 --> 40:36.060]  to play when you punch the button.
[40:36.060 --> 40:40.000]  Exactly, and so this is just Apple TV.
[40:40.000 --> 40:43.360]  This is just like one week's worth of just like
[40:43.360 --> 40:45.640]  what I can recall, not even one week,
[40:45.640 --> 40:47.520]  what I can recall over the last two days.
[40:47.520 --> 40:50.040]  This is like, this is what comes over the Apple TV.
[40:50.040 --> 40:53.640]  And that's not even including various like,
[40:53.640 --> 40:56.760]  you know, like infinite timeouts and failures with Netflix,
[40:56.760 --> 40:58.280]  which I'll give Apple the benefit of the doubt
[40:58.280 --> 41:00.480]  and assume that's Netflix's problem.
[41:00.480 --> 41:02.000]  But even, but like with Apple stuff,
[41:02.000 --> 41:03.400]  authorizing the Apple purchase stuff,
[41:03.400 --> 41:05.140]  even that, you know, that has all those problems.
[41:05.140 --> 41:07.480]  So that's just one product, right?
[41:07.480 --> 41:10.440]  And it's an airplay, and I hear from everybody
[41:10.440 --> 41:12.020]  that airplay doesn't work well for them.
[41:12.020 --> 41:16.960]  Airplay works fine for me if I'm going to an airport express
[41:16.960 --> 41:19.360]  that I have connected to a speaker in my kitchen.
[41:19.360 --> 41:20.340]  It works fine for that.
[41:20.340 --> 41:23.520]  It fails every time for Apple TV, or no, sorry,
[41:23.520 --> 41:25.300]  it fails 75% of the time for Apple TV.
[41:25.300 --> 41:27.760]  Like I'll do it a couple times, eventually it will take.
[41:27.760 --> 41:31.080]  Airplay is on my list and it's high on the list
[41:31.080 --> 41:34.720]  and in terms of like canary in the coal mine,
[41:34.720 --> 41:36.960]  because it used to be rock solid for me.
[41:36.960 --> 41:40.580]  And my typical airplay scenario is, almost always,
[41:40.580 --> 41:44.680]  is either from my phone or from an iPad to Apple TV.
[41:46.800 --> 41:48.560]  A good example of it is,
[41:48.560 --> 41:52.000]  we didn't have Amazon Instant Video on TV
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.600]  until we got a new TiVo sometime,
[41:54.600 --> 41:57.560]  I think in the last year, and it has Amazon built in.
[41:57.560 --> 41:59.280]  Because Amazon, I don't know why,
[41:59.280 --> 42:01.600]  but they don't have an app on Apple TV,
[42:01.600 --> 42:03.920]  whether it's politics or what.
[42:03.920 --> 42:05.240]  But if you wanted to watch something on-
[42:05.240 --> 42:06.440]  Oh, it's definitely politics.
[42:06.440 --> 42:07.480]  Yeah, I'm guessing it's politics.
[42:07.480 --> 42:09.440]  Why do you think they're advertising watches so heavily
[42:09.440 --> 42:11.040]  to every man who visits the site?
[42:13.480 --> 42:14.320]  Are they really?
[42:14.320 --> 42:18.280]  Yeah, ask any man who visited Amazon recently,
[42:18.280 --> 42:19.440]  like what's on the front page.
[42:19.440 --> 42:24.360]  And it's the bottom of the first screen
[42:24.360 --> 42:28.560]  on Amazon.com's front page, is all top men's watches.
[42:28.560 --> 42:31.440]  I have never viewed a link to a watch on Amazon.
[42:31.440 --> 42:33.600]  I've never searched for a watch on Amazon.
[42:33.600 --> 42:36.180]  I have done nothing that would influence that recommendation
[42:36.180 --> 42:37.560]  and it's heavily promoting watches.
[42:37.560 --> 42:40.300]  And I've heard, I tweeted about it a couple of weeks ago,
[42:40.300 --> 42:41.440]  and a bunch of other guys were like,
[42:41.440 --> 42:42.840]  yeah, me too, they showed screenshots.
[42:42.840 --> 42:45.520]  Like, they're so heavily pushing watches right now.
[42:45.520 --> 42:48.840]  It's like, come on, obviously this is about politics.
[42:48.840 --> 42:53.520]  Mine is literally men's blue dial luxury watches.
[42:54.720 --> 42:56.880]  I swear to God, I'm gonna send you the link right now.
[42:56.880 --> 42:58.680]  And have you ever looked at a watch on Amazon?
[42:58.680 --> 43:00.000]  See, that's the thing, that's why-
[43:00.000 --> 43:00.840]  You might've, all right.
[43:00.840 --> 43:03.420]  Yeah, because I don't own, I only own two watches,
[43:03.420 --> 43:05.880]  but I love, I've always loved watches,
[43:05.880 --> 43:07.680]  but it's like, I only buy them if I think
[43:07.680 --> 43:10.920]  they're absolutely perfect, which is why I've only got two.
[43:10.920 --> 43:12.960]  But I look at watches all the time.
[43:12.960 --> 43:14.800]  I don't, and I don't really look for them on Amazon
[43:14.800 --> 43:16.760]  because Amazon, I don't think it's the type of place
[43:16.760 --> 43:17.580]  where I would buy a watch.
[43:17.580 --> 43:19.480]  Although I did, actually I did buy one there years ago.
[43:19.480 --> 43:22.020]  I bought my, my Citizen there.
[43:22.020 --> 43:24.240]  But, no, I didn't.
[43:24.240 --> 43:25.800]  Actually, I did the right thing with the Citizen,
[43:25.800 --> 43:28.560]  where I found it on Amazon, but I wanted to see it in person
[43:28.560 --> 43:30.460]  and I went to a jewelry store here in Philadelphia
[43:30.460 --> 43:31.840]  so I could see it.
[43:31.840 --> 43:34.560]  And it was $15 more expensive in the jewelry store.
[43:34.560 --> 43:36.720]  And I thought, well, this is exactly what I should do.
[43:36.720 --> 43:39.020]  I'm gonna buy it right here because I'm so glad
[43:39.020 --> 43:42.200]  there's a jewelry store here where I could see it.
[43:42.200 --> 43:43.840]  I wanted to give them $15 more.
[43:43.840 --> 43:45.520]  Wow, you were in no room, that's great.
[43:45.520 --> 43:47.960]  Right, I know that that's, and I thought, you know what?
[43:47.960 --> 43:51.840]  I'm like the, I'm not like the 1% like top financial people.
[43:51.840 --> 43:55.360]  I'm the 1% who shops thinking like that.
[43:55.360 --> 43:56.180]  Like, I'm-
[43:56.180 --> 43:58.680]  Yeah, the Amazon 1%.
[43:59.720 --> 44:00.540]  Yeah.
[44:00.540 --> 44:02.680]  It reminds me, there was a New Yorker a couple of weeks ago
[44:02.680 --> 44:06.320]  were on the cover, there was a woman answering her door
[44:06.320 --> 44:10.400]  to take an Amazon box from UPS that was clearly like
[44:10.400 --> 44:12.860]  the size of the ones that they ship the books in,
[44:12.860 --> 44:14.520]  looking awkwardly at her neighbor
[44:14.520 --> 44:16.760]  who runs a little neighborhood bookstore.
[44:16.760 --> 44:20.000]  That's awesome.
[44:20.000 --> 44:23.240]  But anyway, I do have men's blue dial luxury watches
[44:23.240 --> 44:25.200]  right on the front page of my Amazon.
[44:25.200 --> 44:27.320]  Right, so anyway, so Apple TV, so-
[44:27.320 --> 44:29.600]  I had to, until we had the TiVo,
[44:29.600 --> 44:33.080]  I had to AirPlay the Amazon to the Apple TV.
[44:33.080 --> 44:36.240]  And it always worked, it just worked, it was great.
[44:36.240 --> 44:40.280]  And a couple of days ago, I wanted to watch Alpha House,
[44:40.280 --> 44:43.840]  which is a cool, a really fun show I like on Amazon.
[44:43.840 --> 44:48.280]  And I was too lazy to switch the TV from Apple TV
[44:48.280 --> 44:51.120]  where I already was to TiVo,
[44:51.120 --> 44:53.840]  and the TiVo is such a pain in the ass anyway.
[44:53.840 --> 44:57.500]  So I tried using AirPlay and I just got like a spinner
[44:57.500 --> 45:00.760]  and it just spun and spun and spun and spun and spun.
[45:00.760 --> 45:03.160]  And eventually I just did have to switch to the TiVo
[45:03.160 --> 45:05.400]  and use the Amazon app there.
[45:05.400 --> 45:08.360]  Yeah, that spinner should be the Apple TV logo.
[45:08.360 --> 45:09.200]  It used to work though.
[45:09.200 --> 45:10.200]  And then you could print one on the front.
[45:10.200 --> 45:14.120]  For me, it used to work very, very, very consistently.
[45:14.120 --> 45:17.040]  Where any video that wasn't,
[45:17.040 --> 45:19.180]  I think there's a flag you can set to say,
[45:19.180 --> 45:21.920]  you can't AirPlay, but almost nobody said it back then.
[45:21.920 --> 45:25.280]  Almost any video that I could watch on iPhone or iPad,
[45:25.280 --> 45:28.800]  I could switch, I could just flick it continuity style
[45:28.800 --> 45:32.020]  to the Apple TV in, I don't know how many seconds,
[45:32.020 --> 45:35.240]  but a few enough seconds that it felt like magic every time.
[45:35.240 --> 45:38.080]  And now it's really, really a crap shoot.
[45:38.080 --> 45:39.040]  Exactly.
[45:39.040 --> 45:42.240]  And yeah, I mean, I've owned every generation of Apple TV
[45:42.240 --> 45:45.320]  and we use them constantly because we don't have cable.
[45:45.320 --> 45:47.800]  The Apple TV is our primary video player.
[45:49.000 --> 45:53.000]  The only media playback we have in our house is Apple TV
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.760]  and a PS3 for Blu-ray discs, that's it.
[45:55.760 --> 45:57.840]  And so we use them heavily.
[45:57.840 --> 46:01.800]  And it has definitely been a noticeable decline.
[46:01.800 --> 46:04.120]  They didn't used to be this bad.
[46:04.120 --> 46:05.920]  And so again, we can sit here all night
[46:05.920 --> 46:07.200]  and point out things about the Apple TV.
[46:07.200 --> 46:11.480]  I mean, this is probably as interesting as hearing somebody
[46:11.480 --> 46:13.120]  that's like terrible airline story
[46:13.120 --> 46:15.000]  or their dream from last night.
[46:15.000 --> 46:16.520]  So I don't want to bore the audience
[46:16.520 --> 46:18.500]  with all the different little nitpicks
[46:18.500 --> 46:20.640]  of how my stuff has failed.
[46:20.640 --> 46:23.120]  But you can look at a lot of their products recently
[46:23.120 --> 46:26.700]  and see a lot of stories like this from everybody.
[46:26.700 --> 46:28.540]  Glenn Fleischman solicited things on Twitter
[46:28.540 --> 46:30.360]  and had a really good post, like kind of summarizing,
[46:30.360 --> 46:32.240]  like here's what everyone's complaining about.
[46:32.240 --> 46:33.080]  Oh, did he? I didn't see that.
[46:33.080 --> 46:34.680]  Where did he post that?
[46:34.680 --> 46:36.800]  On glog.glennf.com.
[46:36.800 --> 46:39.320]  And I think, yeah, check it.
[46:39.320 --> 46:41.400]  Anyway, you can sort through his tweets
[46:41.400 --> 46:44.600]  for the last two days to try to find a link if you're brave.
[46:44.600 --> 46:46.600]  My Twitter client doesn't go back that far.
[46:46.600 --> 46:51.600]  It took Carrie two days of Glenn Fleischman tweets.
[46:51.600 --> 46:54.240]  So I don't know what client you use.
[46:54.240 --> 46:56.160]  I think you'd need like a special API.
[46:56.160 --> 46:57.840]  I don't even think the Twitter API could handle.
[46:57.840 --> 47:00.500]  Anyway, it is on the front page of his blog
[47:00.500 --> 47:02.360]  and I will put it in the show notes.
[47:02.360 --> 47:03.200]  Yeah, so do that.
[47:03.200 --> 47:04.920]  And then so that's part of it.
[47:04.920 --> 47:08.440]  And I've had issues with Yosemite.
[47:08.440 --> 47:11.720]  Similar to like, I know Neven Mergin was talking on Twitter
[47:11.720 --> 47:15.440]  a couple of weeks back about like he showed a screenshot
[47:15.440 --> 47:17.920]  of how many copies of his computer
[47:17.920 --> 47:19.820]  there were in the finder source list
[47:19.820 --> 47:22.980]  of like the network share area of the finder left pane.
[47:22.980 --> 47:23.820]  And it was like, you know,
[47:23.820 --> 47:25.700]  Neven Mergin's laptop two, three, four, five, six,
[47:25.700 --> 47:28.200]  like it's this giant list of all these different copies.
[47:28.200 --> 47:32.160]  Like I've had a lot of issues with that of like things
[47:32.160 --> 47:34.380]  like losing my original computer's name,
[47:34.380 --> 47:36.660]  showing up as parentheses two,
[47:36.660 --> 47:39.480]  or certain computers just disappearing off my network.
[47:39.480 --> 47:41.720]  Like we have three computers on our home network here
[47:41.720 --> 47:46.280]  and one printer and a NAS box in the closet
[47:46.280 --> 47:47.680]  for network share stuff.
[47:47.680 --> 47:50.840]  And at any given time, I can usually only see
[47:50.840 --> 47:52.760]  between zero and two of them.
[47:52.760 --> 47:54.600]  And like, and it just like,
[47:54.600 --> 47:57.520]  usually you have to reboot, not the one that's browsing,
[47:57.520 --> 48:00.040]  but you have to reboot the one that's not showing up.
[48:00.040 --> 48:01.520]  I haven't read Glenn's article yet,
[48:01.520 --> 48:04.420]  obviously since I was unaware of it, but I can't wait to.
[48:04.420 --> 48:07.640]  But I don't know if his summary goes like this,
[48:07.640 --> 48:10.700]  but yours does so far and a couple that I have jotted down
[48:10.700 --> 48:14.840]  all fit in the category of things that don't even have air,
[48:14.840 --> 48:17.560]  they're not crashers and they don't have error messages.
[48:17.560 --> 48:20.480]  Although they're just silent failures.
[48:20.480 --> 48:22.080]  Exactly.
[48:22.080 --> 48:24.520]  And there are some crashers,
[48:24.520 --> 48:26.240]  but usually like most people aren't hitting them
[48:26.240 --> 48:27.060]  most of the time.
[48:27.060 --> 48:30.160]  I think like, you know, like there are like crashers,
[48:30.160 --> 48:32.720]  they're a bigger problem on iOS, I think.
[48:32.720 --> 48:35.320]  You know, and iOS seven I think was worse than iOS eight
[48:35.320 --> 48:36.220]  in regards to crashes.
[48:36.220 --> 48:40.960]  But, so for instance, on iOS eight, Overcast crashes
[48:40.960 --> 48:43.160]  more than it did on iOS seven in a few key areas.
[48:43.160 --> 48:44.600]  And I don't know if it's my fault or not,
[48:44.600 --> 48:46.120]  but I've heard from a lot of other developers too,
[48:46.120 --> 48:48.100]  one developer even posted stats,
[48:48.100 --> 48:50.280]  their app still runs on both and they posted stats
[48:50.280 --> 48:52.840]  like percentage of installs that have crashed
[48:52.840 --> 48:56.320]  on seven versus eight and the percentage on eight
[48:56.320 --> 48:57.920]  was five times higher.
[48:57.920 --> 49:00.720]  And like, and I've had crashes like deeply,
[49:00.720 --> 49:04.240]  deep in system frameworks, like image IO, I have crashes,
[49:04.240 --> 49:08.400]  like decoding JPEGs for a show art that crashes a lot.
[49:08.400 --> 49:10.480]  And I always say it never happened on seven.
[49:10.480 --> 49:13.280]  Stuff like that, like it, and you know,
[49:13.280 --> 49:16.640]  the background downloading system occasionally has crashes.
[49:16.640 --> 49:18.340]  The audio subsystem will crash
[49:18.340 --> 49:19.840]  and everyone will blame me for it.
[49:19.840 --> 49:24.160]  There's so many like subsystem or API,
[49:24.160 --> 49:27.600]  like low level failures or crashes that happen
[49:27.600 --> 49:29.440]  just rarely enough that it's really hard
[49:29.440 --> 49:32.000]  to ever track it down, but frequently enough
[49:32.000 --> 49:33.240]  that if you have a crash logger in your app,
[49:33.240 --> 49:35.760]  you're gonna see a lot of reports for it.
[49:35.760 --> 49:38.240]  Another one for me, and I tweeted about this,
[49:38.240 --> 49:40.720]  and I actually got somebody from Apple reached out
[49:40.720 --> 49:42.960]  and they said they're gonna look into it.
[49:42.960 --> 49:46.200]  But for me, it's the keyboard shortcuts,
[49:46.200 --> 49:48.800]  not command keys, but like when you have
[49:50.120 --> 49:52.760]  T-E-H go to T-E.
[49:52.760 --> 49:54.560]  Oh, like the Texas Band of Ripoff?
[49:54.560 --> 49:57.960]  Yeah, well, I think that,
[49:57.960 --> 49:59.440]  all right, yeah, the Texas Band of Ripoff.
[49:59.440 --> 50:02.760]  Well, okay, the feature is similar to Texas Band of Ripoff.
[50:02.760 --> 50:05.040]  I think that's a perfect example though
[50:05.040 --> 50:08.440]  of them adding a feature to the system
[50:08.440 --> 50:11.720]  in an appropriate way where it still leaves
[50:11.720 --> 50:14.080]  Texas Bander plenty of room, right?
[50:14.080 --> 50:17.400]  Because they just do, you type this, you get that,
[50:17.400 --> 50:20.100]  whereas Texas Bander has all of the interactive stuff
[50:20.100 --> 50:22.040]  where you can have, you know.
[50:22.040 --> 50:23.680]  You have like forms almost from Texas Bander.
[50:23.680 --> 50:26.100]  Yeah, or like I've got the Texas Bander ones
[50:26.100 --> 50:27.560]  to put the date in certain formats.
[50:27.560 --> 50:28.380]  Right, right.
[50:28.380 --> 50:30.480]  So I just type my key, my little shortcut,
[50:30.480 --> 50:32.680]  and I get today's date right the way I like it.
[50:32.680 --> 50:35.240]  You can't do that, you know, dynamic ones, variables.
[50:35.240 --> 50:40.240]  Anyway, but they used to sync between devices
[50:40.600 --> 50:44.040]  and then they stopped syncing.
[50:44.040 --> 50:46.240]  And they stopped syncing when I switched
[50:46.240 --> 50:51.240]  to the iCloud documents in the cloud beta.
[50:51.320 --> 50:52.160]  The drive?
[50:52.160 --> 50:53.920]  iCloud drive beta, which I had to do over some,
[50:53.920 --> 50:55.600]  well, I didn't have to, but I did over summer
[50:55.600 --> 50:57.640]  because I was beta testing some stuff
[50:57.640 --> 50:59.520]  that I wanted to use it and try it.
[50:59.520 --> 51:01.200]  And so the fact that it stopped working then,
[51:01.200 --> 51:03.640]  I understood because maybe they were using,
[51:03.640 --> 51:05.600]  you know, and they warn you, hey, when you switch,
[51:05.600 --> 51:07.680]  you can't go back, you know, you're always on it.
[51:07.680 --> 51:09.560]  And so I thought, oh, so that's interesting.
[51:09.560 --> 51:12.600]  They must've been using the old storage APIs
[51:12.600 --> 51:15.080]  for these keyboard shortcuts and that's how they did it.
[51:15.080 --> 51:17.300]  But now, you know, here it was like two months
[51:17.300 --> 51:18.800]  after everything had come out of beta.
[51:18.800 --> 51:23.260]  You know, I was running a new phone, running iOS 9.
[51:23.260 --> 51:28.260]  I was running a new, just to make it even more likely
[51:28.260 --> 51:32.940]  that it should work, a brand new retina MacBook Pro
[51:32.940 --> 51:36.700]  running the non-beta, you know, version of Yosemite.
[51:36.700 --> 51:41.020]  And they still weren't syncing, nothing was syncing.
[51:41.020 --> 51:43.020]  None of the most shortcuts were syncing.
[51:44.480 --> 51:48.180]  And then, and this to me, it emblemizes the sort of thing
[51:48.180 --> 51:51.920]  I'm thinking that, you know, is the modern Apple
[51:53.060 --> 51:55.080]  unsteady software.
[51:55.080 --> 51:58.060]  They did start syncing, but not all of them.
[51:58.060 --> 52:02.500]  Now, like on my phone and on my Mac,
[52:03.900 --> 52:06.060]  almost all of them are the same.
[52:06.060 --> 52:07.860]  And I definitely never once,
[52:07.860 --> 52:09.180]  cause I wanted to see what would happen.
[52:09.180 --> 52:11.960]  I never once like said, okay, just take 10 minutes
[52:11.960 --> 52:14.980]  and reproduce them in both places so you have them all.
[52:14.980 --> 52:16.780]  I just waited and they're mostly there.
[52:16.780 --> 52:18.420]  But there's one in particular,
[52:18.420 --> 52:19.980]  it's sort of like a game of where's Waldo,
[52:19.980 --> 52:21.420]  like scrolling the two lists,
[52:21.420 --> 52:22.660]  trying to find the ones that are missing.
[52:22.660 --> 52:23.940]  And it's even made more difficult
[52:23.940 --> 52:26.620]  because they sort in a different order
[52:26.620 --> 52:29.140]  in terms of the way ones that,
[52:29.140 --> 52:31.420]  the way that ones, like regular,
[52:31.420 --> 52:33.340]  if it's just alphabetical characters,
[52:33.340 --> 52:34.380]  they sort alphabetically.
[52:34.380 --> 52:36.540]  But the Mac puts the ones with punctual,
[52:36.540 --> 52:38.220]  leading punctuation at the top
[52:38.220 --> 52:40.420]  and the iPhone puts ones with leading punctuation
[52:40.420 --> 52:41.260]  at the bottom.
[52:42.760 --> 52:44.500]  So it's a little hard to compare the two.
[52:44.500 --> 52:47.340]  Again, none of this is a reportable bug.
[52:47.340 --> 52:50.220]  Like, or rather none of this will report itself to Apple.
[52:50.220 --> 52:52.460]  Yeah, and it's so hard.
[52:52.460 --> 52:54.940]  But I know for example, I have a custom one
[52:54.940 --> 52:57.900]  because you can use it to add custom words
[52:57.900 --> 52:59.980]  and it's not even like an expansion.
[52:59.980 --> 53:04.780]  But I use the word navbar as all one word, N-A-V-B-A-R,
[53:05.740 --> 53:07.420]  all the time when I'm talking with Dave Whiskus
[53:07.420 --> 53:08.420]  about Vesper.
[53:09.580 --> 53:12.340]  It's just, I call the thing at the top, the navbar.
[53:13.520 --> 53:15.600]  And it's always, always on the iPhone,
[53:15.600 --> 53:16.620]  like when I'd be iMessaging,
[53:16.620 --> 53:18.820]  I'm auto-correcting it into who knows what,
[53:18.820 --> 53:21.900]  just random guesses from the dictionary that were close.
[53:21.900 --> 53:24.420]  So I put it in my thing and it's on my phone,
[53:24.420 --> 53:25.860]  which is the place where I need it,
[53:25.860 --> 53:28.180]  but it's not on my Mac.
[53:28.180 --> 53:29.840]  Whereas like the other, I don't know,
[53:29.840 --> 53:33.240]  there's like maybe 30 of them seem mostly in sync.
[53:34.260 --> 53:36.620]  Crazy, like I don't, and there's never an error message.
[53:36.620 --> 53:39.740]  There's never any, an error on any device that says,
[53:39.740 --> 53:41.820]  hey, you've got a problem with your keyboards,
[53:41.820 --> 53:43.980]  shortcut syncing, turn it off, turn it back on again,
[53:43.980 --> 53:45.660]  or nothing, no errors.
[53:45.660 --> 53:48.940]  I just don't have some of them on both devices.
[53:48.940 --> 53:50.580]  Yeah, it's even worse with this cloud stuff
[53:50.580 --> 53:52.820]  because you have so little insight
[53:52.820 --> 53:55.860]  as to what the problem is, if there's even a problem,
[53:55.860 --> 53:58.780]  or how to fix a problem once it happens.
[53:58.780 --> 54:02.360]  Like, and so like, you know, if you look at,
[54:02.360 --> 54:06.020]  if you look at Apple's, you know, crash rate history,
[54:06.020 --> 54:07.500]  like, you know, let's say somebody inside Apple
[54:07.500 --> 54:09.460]  is looking at like, well, you know,
[54:09.460 --> 54:10.820]  we have the same rate of crashes now
[54:10.820 --> 54:12.300]  that we did five years ago, whatever, you know,
[54:12.300 --> 54:13.120]  whatever it is.
[54:14.940 --> 54:18.000]  I think you have to also consider that now
[54:18.000 --> 54:21.220]  we are doing a lot more with our devices and our computers.
[54:21.220 --> 54:23.580]  We have more devices and computers interacting
[54:23.580 --> 54:26.060]  with each other per person, especially around
[54:26.060 --> 54:30.580]  in these crowds, and the cloud services
[54:30.580 --> 54:31.500]  are this other factor.
[54:31.500 --> 54:33.300]  And so like, I said this in ATP,
[54:33.300 --> 54:34.640]  so I won't go too far into it here,
[54:34.640 --> 54:39.640]  but you know, if let's say you have like a 1% bug rate
[54:39.860 --> 54:42.700]  for like, you know, when you're using this app
[54:42.700 --> 54:45.500]  or this service of the OS, 1% of the time,
[54:45.500 --> 54:46.340]  it won't work right.
[54:46.340 --> 54:48.600]  Obviously, this is made up, but bear with me.
[54:48.600 --> 54:52.500]  So if then you consider the interaction
[54:52.500 --> 54:56.000]  of two different apps or services that have the same rate,
[54:56.000 --> 54:57.620]  it's 2%.
[54:57.620 --> 55:00.340]  If you consider it again, it's not three,
[55:00.340 --> 55:02.960]  if you consider a third one, it's not 3%, it's 4%,
[55:02.960 --> 55:05.620]  because these things don't add, they multiply.
[55:05.620 --> 55:09.240]  Because every, as you add more possible ways of interaction
[55:09.240 --> 55:13.960]  between applications, services, cloud services, devices,
[55:13.960 --> 55:16.620]  all those failure rates, the chances that any one thing
[55:16.620 --> 55:21.100]  is gonna go wrong somehow is the multiple,
[55:21.100 --> 55:24.360]  the product of all of those factors, not the sum.
[55:24.360 --> 55:26.960]  So this grows geometrically.
[55:26.960 --> 55:28.880]  And so as you make things more complicated,
[55:28.880 --> 55:31.280]  as our devices can do more, as we have more devices
[55:31.280 --> 55:33.100]  interacting with each other, and also interacting
[55:33.100 --> 55:36.080]  with the cloud services, all of these error factors
[55:36.080 --> 55:38.360]  are all multiplied.
[55:38.360 --> 55:41.860]  And so you have to, you can't just keep quality
[55:41.860 --> 55:44.360]  the same as it used to be, like you know,
[55:44.360 --> 55:47.140]  like the quality rate per service or per app,
[55:47.140 --> 55:49.560]  it has to actually get better over time
[55:49.560 --> 55:51.880]  to keep the same overall error rate
[55:51.880 --> 55:53.240]  from happening to somebody.
[55:53.240 --> 55:54.080]  Yeah.
[55:56.060 --> 55:59.080]  Yeah, and I'm not accusing anybody at Apple of incompetence,
[55:59.080 --> 56:02.740]  because I don't think any of these bugs are like universal.
[56:02.740 --> 56:05.240]  It's not like nobody can play AirPlay, I'm sure.
[56:05.240 --> 56:06.760]  And I've written worse bugs today.
[56:06.760 --> 56:09.760]  I mean like, I fixed a really embarrassing bug
[56:09.760 --> 56:13.000]  two hours ago in Overcast, like really embarrassing.
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.040]  I would bet good, I mean that's how real bugs are.
[56:15.040 --> 56:17.220]  Real bugs are edge cases to some degree.
[56:17.220 --> 56:18.900]  Maybe it's a big edge, but it's you know,
[56:18.900 --> 56:22.280]  something you didn't think of most of the time.
[56:22.280 --> 56:24.360]  I'm thinking most of the time, I'm thinking
[56:24.360 --> 56:26.760]  if you go to an Apple Store and buy a new Apple TV,
[56:26.760 --> 56:30.120]  and you pick up a new iPhone or iPad,
[56:30.120 --> 56:34.620]  and you set them up and create a brand new iCloud account,
[56:34.620 --> 56:37.600]  and go to use AirPlay, it'll just work.
[56:37.600 --> 56:42.240]  It'll, I'll bet 99 times out of 100, that will just work.
[56:42.240 --> 56:44.800]  There's no bug that's keeping most people from doing it,
[56:44.800 --> 56:47.140]  but there's clearly some bugs that, you know,
[56:47.140 --> 56:50.240]  and who knows, it might be like 100 different bugs,
[56:50.240 --> 56:51.540]  you know, that result in the same thing,
[56:51.540 --> 56:55.520]  and they're all, you know, just 1 10th of 1%
[56:55.520 --> 56:57.980]  of people have taken that path.
[56:57.980 --> 57:00.320]  But then in the aggregate, it winds up
[57:00.320 --> 57:02.360]  where there's a lot of people who are having trouble
[57:02.360 --> 57:03.700]  with stuff like this.
[57:03.700 --> 57:06.520]  Exactly, and again, like so many of these things
[57:06.520 --> 57:10.220]  are hard to report, or too minor to report
[57:10.220 --> 57:12.880]  individual problems, like through the bug reporter system.
[57:12.880 --> 57:14.260]  I mean, and the bug reporter system, too,
[57:14.260 --> 57:17.600]  is about as hostile as it can be.
[57:18.600 --> 57:20.760]  Like, if you go to actually report a bug
[57:20.760 --> 57:23.780]  on Apple's bug reporter, you'll be greeted,
[57:23.780 --> 57:26.060]  first of all, is it still iOS 6 themed?
[57:27.700 --> 57:28.540]  I think it is, right?
[57:28.540 --> 57:30.920]  Yeah, which was a big improvement
[57:30.920 --> 57:33.200]  over the Aqua theme it used to have.
[57:33.200 --> 57:35.320]  Well, they gave it the iOS 6 theme
[57:35.320 --> 57:38.300]  like three days before iOS 7 was unveiled, remember that?
[57:38.300 --> 57:40.680]  It had, but it had like a 10.0.
[57:40.680 --> 57:41.520]  I know.
[57:41.520 --> 57:42.340]  Like when...
[57:42.340 --> 57:43.340]  It was bad.
[57:43.340 --> 57:45.780]  When Aqua was really stripey, it had the big,
[57:45.780 --> 57:49.080]  the pinstripes, horizontal pinstripes for a long time.
[57:49.080 --> 57:53.860]  And yeah, they updated it to like an iOS 6 look
[57:53.860 --> 57:55.880]  right before iOS 7 came out.
[57:55.880 --> 57:59.100]  It was like days or weeks before, it was hilarious.
[57:59.100 --> 58:00.300]  It was like, obviously these two groups
[58:00.300 --> 58:02.160]  weren't talking to each other about that.
[58:02.160 --> 58:04.840]  Oh, anyway, so you're greeted with this,
[58:04.840 --> 58:08.820]  you know, this pretty terrible web app, first of all.
[58:08.820 --> 58:12.000]  And then it asks you for like 17 different fields
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.680]  and then you fill your stuff out and then you submit it
[58:14.680 --> 58:16.220]  and they say, all right, thanks.
[58:16.220 --> 58:17.060]  We'll look into it.
[58:17.060 --> 58:18.480]  Here's a number.
[58:18.480 --> 58:21.560]  And in most cases of bugs I filed,
[58:21.560 --> 58:22.620]  I filed maybe, I don't know,
[58:22.620 --> 58:26.120]  50 bugs so far in my life with Apple.
[58:26.120 --> 58:28.460]  In almost every case, you will never hear about it again.
[58:28.460 --> 58:30.160]  They won't even tell you if it's a duplicate.
[58:30.160 --> 58:31.180]  They won't even tell you if it's closed.
[58:31.180 --> 58:34.020]  It'll sit there open forever.
[58:34.020 --> 58:39.020]  Sometimes they will tell you after like three months,
[58:39.560 --> 58:40.680]  this is a known bug.
[58:40.680 --> 58:43.880]  It's a duplicate of this other bug ID, thank you.
[58:43.880 --> 58:45.120]  But then you lose all visibility.
[58:45.120 --> 58:47.920]  Then you can't tell when that other bug ID is closed.
[58:47.920 --> 58:50.320]  Like you just, they just basically close your book
[58:50.320 --> 58:51.360]  saying, all right, thanks.
[58:51.360 --> 58:53.560]  All right, I just logged into my radar account
[58:53.560 --> 58:58.060]  and here's one that I filed on the 20th of March, 2009.
[58:59.500 --> 59:02.920]  State, open, rank, no value.
[59:02.920 --> 59:04.160]  And it's, here's what I said.
[59:04.160 --> 59:07.320]  I said, when you control, it said product Safari.
[59:07.320 --> 59:11.140]  When you control click, right click on a background tab
[59:11.140 --> 59:14.120]  in Safari 4, you get a menu with options for things
[59:14.120 --> 59:15.920]  like creating a new tab, closing the tab,
[59:15.920 --> 59:17.800]  reloading the tab and so forth.
[59:17.800 --> 59:19.980]  It would be nice if there were an option
[59:19.980 --> 59:22.160]  to copy the URL for that tab.
[59:22.160 --> 59:24.640]  That way you could copy the URL for a background tab
[59:24.640 --> 59:26.840]  in a background window without either activating
[59:26.840 --> 59:28.820]  that window or that particular tab.
[59:29.920 --> 59:31.520]  I think it's a reasonable request.
[59:31.520 --> 59:34.240]  I'm not saying it's great, but it's the fact
[59:34.240 --> 59:37.280]  that it's just there, green, open.
[59:37.280 --> 59:39.620]  Yep, like still waiting for response from Apple.
[59:39.620 --> 59:44.160]  And that's, this is not uncommon.
[59:44.160 --> 59:46.120]  This is the common case.
[59:46.120 --> 59:51.120]  I'm not mad that they haven't done it.
[59:51.320 --> 59:52.840]  Actually, let me see.
[59:52.840 --> 59:54.480]  Nope, you still can't copy a tab.
[59:54.480 --> 59:56.760]  Nope, it's the same option for a listing.
[59:56.760 --> 59:58.940]  So I'm not mad that they haven't taken my suggestion
[59:58.940 --> 59:59.880]  and done something.
[59:59.880 --> 01:00:02.280]  But that's what, for everybody at Apple always telling me,
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.320]  that's what I should do with an idea like that,
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.440]  is file a radar.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.280]  Right.
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:07.600]  Right, but the fact that it's open,
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.640]  like I wouldn't mind if they just said closed.
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.320]  No, we don't think copy belongs in that menu.
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:15.520]  Okay, thanks for considering the idea.
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.800]  It's the fact that it looks to me
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.680]  as though nobody's ever looked at it.
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:21.800]  Right, and they probably never will until at some point
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.200]  some intern is tasked with going through that list
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:25.840]  and they just like bulk close them all
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:28.300]  or send like a form letter to all of them saying,
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:30.080]  all right, you know, is this still a problem?
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.980]  Please provide a sample project to illustrate the problem.
[01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:33.820]  And then if you don't,
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:34.820]  this will automatically close in a day.
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:37.200]  Like that's the kind of thing you get.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:40.940]  I mean, it's just, I mean, let's see, I have,
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.740]  so my oldest is 2011.
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:47.640]  I mean, I have four bugs here in one of my accounts.
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:52.280]  2011, 2011, 2013, all green, no responses.
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.000]  I mean, so this is the problem I have with,
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.460]  you know, the typical Apple answer is,
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:00.400]  well, please, you have to file a bug for any bugs you find
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.800]  or any feature requests you have, or et cetera.
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:04.700]  If you're gonna say that,
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:07.020]  if that's gonna be your default response,
[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:08.700]  this system has to be better.
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:11.860]  This system has to, it has to be less hostile
[01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:16.580]  and it has to somehow give some kind of satisfactory result.
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:20.320]  Even if it's as simple as after like a week,
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.960]  you say, you know, thanks, we took it,
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.120]  we're taking this into consideration
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:26.760]  or we'll have somebody look at this and then close it.
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.940]  Like some kind of something that indicates
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:31.800]  to the person who filed the bug
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:34.800]  that it was worth their time to have filed it.
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.860]  And that's the problem right now, you don't have that.
[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:41.180]  And so there's no incentive for individuals to file bugs
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:44.200]  if you think anyone else will have ever filed the same bug.
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.740]  Well, there's the adage that insanity
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:48.300]  is doing the same thing over,
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:50.160]  the definition of insanity is doing the same thing
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.180]  over and over and over again
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:54.340]  and expecting different results.
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:56.580]  And it's, you know, there's, it's a lot, you know,
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:58.220]  that makes a lot of sense, it's actually true.
[01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:03.060]  That's, to me, it seems almost insane to keep filing radars
[01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:07.100]  when you expecting them to be dealt with
[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.820]  when your experience is this is just a waste of my time.
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:11.780]  Exactly, and I've had so many people
[01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:14.460]  who work at Apple tell me, please file radars,
[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:16.660]  they really do matter, they really do help,
[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:18.060]  please keep filing them.
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:19.780]  And they all say too, like they all say
[01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:23.740]  that they get a surprisingly low number of radars filed
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.780]  for, you know, like you would expect certain things
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:26.780]  to have a lot and they say, you know,
[01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:28.660]  certain feature requests or major feature requests
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:31.660]  will have like seven radars ever filed on them or something.
[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:34.140]  But the problem is like, you know,
[01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:36.900]  they're yelling at us saying, please file bugs.
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:39.100]  Their actions don't back that up.
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:41.460]  Like what we see on the outside
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:46.060]  is extremely hostile and demotivating.
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:46.980]  Yeah, I wanna hold that thought
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:47.820]  because I wanna come back to that,
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:50.300]  but I wanna come back to it with a big section,
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:51.140]  but I'll do a break.
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.180]  But before I take the break,
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:54.340]  I just wanted to say another thing too
[01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:56.460]  was that your article,
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:58.100]  one of the things that had me nodding my head
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:01.380]  with your article as sort of, yeah,
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:03.340]  like now I kind of feel like one of them
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:06.100]  being like a Windows user is,
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.420]  so we've got a laser printer here and it's an HP
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:11.660]  and I'm pretty happy with the quality and it does wifi.
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:12.500]  And-
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:13.860]  You bought the same one I did, right?
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:15.060]  Maybe I do.
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:16.060]  It's the CP1525NW.
[01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:22.660]  Yeah, it's one of HP's wonderful.
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:23.900]  Yeah, you asked me what to buy
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.260]  and I told you to get that one.
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:28.700]  Yeah, I did take my usual Just Ask Marco.
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:29.540]  Yeah.
[01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:30.380]  And it exposes-
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:31.220]  I still have mine, it works fine.
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:32.420]  Well, except when it dies,
[01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:34.420]  except when it disappears from my network for-
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:35.260]  And it lies.
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:37.860]  Oh, it lies so bad about how much toner it has left.
[01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:39.860]  It lies like a thief in the night.
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:42.740]  Mine has been saying it has extremely low supply levels
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:46.340]  for about three years and it's still printing just fine.
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:48.340]  It is telling me I'm low on color.
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:50.340]  I print color, I swear to God,
[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:52.620]  like once a year, Jonas has like a school product check
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:53.620]  that needs color.
[01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:54.980]  I print everything black and white.
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:57.660]  I know you've got plenty of color, you lion bastards.
[01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:00.860]  Anyway, and you know what, with the black,
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:02.380]  it told me that I ran out of black
[01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.140]  and eventually I really did run out.
[01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:06.340]  But it was telling me, it was like,
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:07.180]  give me this error message.
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:09.380]  Like, I've got no toner, none, nothing.
[01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:11.660]  And then the paper would come out and it looks great.
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:13.020]  It just looks great.
[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:14.860]  And I know what I've,
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:17.580]  from working at student newspapers
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:20.380]  and doing print graphic design for years before,
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:22.660]  I know what low toner looks like.
[01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:23.580]  It's pretty obvious.
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:25.100]  It's not a subtle change.
[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:26.660]  Like, it's like, yeah,
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:29.500]  when your printer's actually running out of toner,
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.820]  it looks like it, like it's right there,
[01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:32.660]  right in your face.
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:33.500]  Like-
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:34.340]  It looks exactly what it sounds like.
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:36.180]  It's like, wow, I can hardly read this.
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.380]  The letters are almost-
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:38.740]  Right, everything's all spotted.
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:40.620]  And yeah, like you could definitely tell.
[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:43.820]  Anyway, it exposes itself over bonjour.
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:46.740]  And so, I don't know.
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:50.460]  But so to set it up is really kind of easy.
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:51.900]  And I'm gonna have to say,
[01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:53.620]  and going back even further,
[01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:54.500]  the thing that cracked me up
[01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:55.780]  about the Business Insider headline
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:57.820]  is calling you a long-time Mac user
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:04:59.420]  or long-time Apple supporter.
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:00.340]  I don't know.
[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:02.460]  It's like anybody who joined the team in 2003,
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:03.740]  you're not long time.
[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:04.940]  2004, I was even-
[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:07.020]  And I was still using Windows until 2005.
[01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:09.060]  Like I was using them both for a while.
[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:11.820]  One of the things that was never as good on Mac OS X
[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:14.380]  as classic Mac OS was setting up printers.
[01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:15.700]  Like in the old days,
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:16.540]  cause it, you know,
[01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:18.660]  and it used to be that you had to get like an Apple printer,
[01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:20.300]  like either one from Apple,
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:22.660]  believe it or not, used to make printers,
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:25.780]  or, you know, like some kind of Apple compatible printer.
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:27.420]  But it always just worked.
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:29.420]  It was the,
[01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:31.420]  maybe one of the canonical examples
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:33.140]  of the differences between Apple's
[01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:36.420]  it just works experience and the PC world.
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:38.420]  You never had to worry about drivers, anything like that.
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:39.860]  You just plug it in.
[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:41.820]  There it is, shows up in your chooser.
[01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:44.140]  You pick the printer and boom, it works.
[01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:46.980]  Like just, it was never a problem.
[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:49.820]  And in Mac OS X, I thought that just got worse.
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:53.060]  And it was sort of the shift to industry standard printers
[01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:55.460]  and short of just the,
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:59.060]  that those underpinnings of next
[01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:01.420]  were never as hooked up to like, you know,
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:04.460]  the print world as Apple's classic Mac OS was.
[01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:06.420]  But anyway, it got better for a while.
[01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:09.500]  This printer, when I first got it, was great.
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:12.700]  It's, you go to the printer thing in system preferences
[01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:14.060]  and there it is listed.
[01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:15.500]  You hit plus, there it is listed.
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:16.860]  It's like, here's a Bonjour printer.
[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:17.780]  Is this the one you want?
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:20.180]  Yes, there it is.
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:22.700]  Just the last week, I went to print something
[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:25.940]  and it, you know, and I had,
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:28.300]  it's the only printer I have, the only printer I use.
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.900]  I hadn't changed it.
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:30.900]  And it just said, you know,
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:32.940]  printer can't be reached or something.
[01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:34.700]  And nothing would, it just wouldn't come out.
[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:37.140]  Like it was just the jobs were queuing up
[01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:38.940]  in that thing in the dock.
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:39.900]  So I deleted it.
[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:42.460]  I deleted the printer and I went to re-add it
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:44.500]  and it wasn't even listed.
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.020]  And in the old, and you know what I did?
[01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:47.260]  I just thought, ah, screw it.
[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:48.380]  I'll print from Amy's.
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:50.740]  And I like went to, emailed it to Amy
[01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:54.380]  and printed from Amy's computer and it worked.
[01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:56.380]  And then I just left it at that.
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:58.380]  And I realized when I read your article
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:01.860]  that in the old days, like three, four, five years ago,
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:03.540]  when I would have instantly thought
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:05.860]  it's gotta be the printer and went upstairs
[01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:07.900]  and just turned the printer on and off.
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:09.740]  And in fact, that actually worked.
[01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:12.100]  I did after, you know, it was your article
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:12.940]  that made me test it.
[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:14.820]  I went up, turned the printer off, turned it back on,
[01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:16.940]  and then boom, it just worked.
[01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:18.180]  Reconnecting it to my Mac.
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:19.740]  So it was the printer's fault.
[01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:21.260]  But in the old days, I would have just assumed
[01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:22.180]  it was the printer's fault.
[01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:24.260]  Whereas now I thought, ah, screw it.
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:25.860]  Something's wrong with Yosemite.
[01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:30.180]  I think, well, I've had the same issue
[01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:32.060]  and it's like I have the same issue
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:35.740]  with other Yosemite Macs that are on the network.
[01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:38.780]  So I think it's an issue with Yosemite
[01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:41.260]  losing its connection to the printer,
[01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:42.820]  like losing its discovery of the printer.
[01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:46.180]  Like, so Yosemite, they rewrote some part
[01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:47.420]  of the networking stack.
[01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:49.980]  I don't know the details, but they basically combined
[01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:53.180]  some of the discovery and that related stuff
[01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:55.460]  into this new thing called Discovery-D.
[01:07:55.460 --> 01:08:00.060]  And people keep reporting a lot of WiFi
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:02.780]  and network discovery issues with Yosemite.
[01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:04.940]  It's probably related to that because they changed
[01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:07.140]  a bunch of that to enable things like continuity
[01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:08.540]  and handoff and stuff like that,
[01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:10.300]  and airdrops between the two.
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:13.300]  So that stuff all changed in Yosemite.
[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:14.780]  So that's most likely the source of the problem.
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:17.780]  So my spidey sense that it was Yosemite probably is right.
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:19.940]  It's just that the solution of turning the printer
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:23.220]  off and on probably isn't even HP's fault.
[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:24.260]  No, it almost certainly isn't,
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:25.460]  because I have the same problem
[01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:27.340]  with every Mac on the network.
[01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:28.180]  Well, I believe it.
[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:31.700]  A lot of networking problems in general,
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:33.900]  and again, not one networking issue,
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:36.540]  but just Hockenberry's description of it
[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:38.540]  as a thousand paper cuts is exactly right,
[01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:40.780]  is a big chunk of them seem to be networking.
[01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:41.820]  And networking is hard.
[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:46.820]  I mean, as you said earlier, we know Apple has great people
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:48.860]  working for them.
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:51.580]  We know that these aren't idiots doing this.
[01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:54.860]  But the fact is, my point in the piece
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:57.100]  was they're doing too much,
[01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:58.500]  and it's really starting to show.
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:03.500]  It always feels like we're using a 1.0 release or a beta.
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:07.540]  There used to be some kind of stability
[01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:10.620]  between betas and the GMs.
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:11.780]  It was never perfect,
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:14.140]  but there used to be a differentiator like,
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:17.380]  okay, well, stuff's gonna stop changing right before the GM
[01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:18.980]  by some interval of time,
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:21.940]  and the GM will be a higher degree of quality
[01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:23.220]  than the betas were.
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:25.700]  And then a couple revisions down the line,
[01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:28.440]  once you have a 0.3, 0.4 kind of range,
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:31.100]  it'll be really stable for the next year and a half
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.780]  until they release a new major version.
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:34.460]  If you treat it, it used to be, I think,
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:36.100]  for a number of years,
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:38.660]  and I would say it probably covers the early years
[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:43.660]  on the platform, like that 2004 to 2008-ish, 9-ish period.
[01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:48.660]  If you just had the conservative patience
[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:53.540]  to treat every release as minus one, you'd do pretty well.
[01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:57.580]  So in other words, trust that the betas are gonna suck,
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:00.620]  and trust that the GM is really just a beta,
[01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:04.620]  and then trust that the 1.0 release of the OS
[01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:07.140]  is really like a public beta,
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:12.140]  and wait for the first major public update after the 1.0,
[01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:17.020]  after system iOS 5.0 ships.
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:20.260]  Wait for 5.01, or maybe 5.02,
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:23.460]  and you'll have a really solid OS.
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:25.900]  Exactly, and these days it feels like
[01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:30.900]  we never reach that point of a few point Xs in,
[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:32.660]  and now it's stable.
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:37.380]  Now we're always in the beta 1.0, 1.1 loop, it seems,
[01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:39.180]  and I know technically version-wise,
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:41.420]  they've passed 1.1 with some of these,
[01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:46.420]  but it just seems like, and the GMs seem
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:50.060]  so minimally different from the betas in terms of quality,
[01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:51.860]  like even worse than they used to be.
[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:53.260]  It seems like we're just always in beta now.
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:56.780]  Seems like they only get around to fixing the crashers,
[01:10:56.780 --> 01:10:59.260]  the big ones, and they never get around to the cleanup,
[01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:02.500]  and it's Guy English's point that the annual cycle
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:05.540]  means that, and we're probably hitting that point right now,
[01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:07.540]  where a lot of engineering talent at Apple
[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:12.540]  is probably going towards the WWDC releases
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:17.980]  of what I am guessing will be iOS 9 and system 10.11.
[01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:26.020]  Exactly, this cycle, it doesn't leave time
[01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:27.700]  for stability, really.
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:30.620]  It doesn't leave time for all those boring little bug fixes
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.620]  to be applied to the old, ancient version
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:33.780]  that we're all still using,
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:36.060]  because nothing ever gets that old.
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:40.620]  Yeah, let me take a break and thank our second sponsor,
[01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:44.220]  and it is your and my, everybody's very good friends
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:46.220]  at Squarespace.
[01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:49.340]  You guys know Squarespace, it's the all-in-one platform
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:54.240]  where you can host, build, design, create your website.
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.660]  You need a website, you go to Squarespace,
[01:11:56.660 --> 01:12:00.060]  and you have a website, it's that easy.
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:01.300]  You get to pick your domain name,
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:03.780]  you get to pick from a bunch,
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:05.500]  including a whole bunch of new ones.
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:09.820]  Themes, you get to edit the content right there
[01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:11.640]  in your website.
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:14.680]  When you're logged in, you can just drag the stuff around,
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:16.780]  add the components you want.
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:18.500]  So many presets to choose from.
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.700]  And they have a brand new Squarespace 7,
[01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:23.760]  that's the latest version.
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:26.620]  You can go to squarespace.com slash 7,
[01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:29.040]  spell it out like the movie, S-E-V-E-N,
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.120]  and see all the new stuff.
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.840]  Because you guys know, we talk about Squarespace
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:35.000]  all the time, they sponsor shows for years.
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:37.000]  So you're familiar with it.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.640]  Go to that URL slash 7 at their site
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:40.800]  and find out the new stuff.
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:42.760]  But at the highlights, they've got integration
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.880]  with Google Apps, that's huge for people
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:49.300]  who are using this with companies that use Google Apps.
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.960]  They've redesigned their whole interface.
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.060]  They have a partnership with Getty Images now,
[01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:58.840]  so you can get stock photos and images right there
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:02.080]  from within the Squarespace interface.
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:05.040]  New templates, things like cover pages,
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:06.440]  so you can have like a splash screen,
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:07.720]  splash screens are back.
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:11.760]  And probably best of all, the best thing that they have,
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.280]  I think, isn't even technical, it's their tech support.
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:19.040]  24-7, all hours, all days, you can get tech support
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.720]  via live chat and email.
[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:24.960]  And the whole thing, it starts at eight bucks a month.
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:25.960]  You just can't lose.
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:30.960]  And you get, I forget how much, I don't know,
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:33.140]  what is it, a month?
[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:34.380]  What do you get, a month free?
[01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:35.260]  The trial?
[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:37.100]  Yeah, they don't even tell you how much.
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:37.940]  Yeah, they don't even tell you.
[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:39.100]  I think it starts out as a week,
[01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:41.500]  but then when you hit that week,
[01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:42.500]  they'll send you an email saying,
[01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:43.740]  hey, do you want more time?
[01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:44.700]  And you just click a link
[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:45.860]  and they give you like another week.
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:48.500]  Yeah, that's how confident they are
[01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:49.820]  that you're gonna stick with it
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:52.680]  because once your free trial's over, eventually,
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:55.660]  you're gonna be like, I'd be nuts to leave.
[01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:56.780]  This is great.
[01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:58.740]  You do it with no credit card required.
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:03.740]  Just go there and start creating a website, free.
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:06.580]  So the URL to know that they came from the show
[01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:09.480]  is squarespace.com slash Gruber.
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:15.020]  And the code, when you sign up, is my initials, JG.
[01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:16.900]  I don't know why they don't match up,
[01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:18.840]  but it's that code that you need.
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:19.820]  You need to keep that in mind
[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:21.200]  because it really doesn't matter what you do
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:22.040]  when you sign up.
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:24.220]  Go there, just go to squarespace.com and sign up
[01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:25.280]  because you're gonna get a free trial.
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:27.860]  You'd be, why pay, you know, take the free trial to start.
[01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:29.060]  It's when the free trial's over,
[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:31.540]  you gotta remember the code, JG.
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:34.300]  And when you use that code, you'll save 10%.
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:36.860]  So not only will you help support the show,
[01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:38.420]  but you'll save some of your own money as well.
[01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:39.820]  So my thanks to Squarespace.
[01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:42.240]  If you need a website, you're nuts
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:44.140]  if you don't look at Squarespace first.
[01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:47.680]  That's my new slogan for Squarespace.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:48.820]  I could have you do all my ad breach,
[01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:49.660]  somebody's better at it.
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:50.480]  I like yours.
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:51.320]  I like the one,
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:54.360]  because you actually had this story about your kid's school
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:56.420]  with the preschool or whatever,
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:59.500]  and they were gonna spend $7,000 on a website.
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.460]  I think it was three, it was three or 3,500.
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:03.260]  I don't know, but it's, anybody,
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:05.620]  and if you, everybody knows, there is not a,
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:07.380]  schools don't have money to burn.
[01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:08.220]  It's just-
[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:10.100]  No, it's like a little co-op preschool.
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:13.260]  Like, this is not a, like, they don't have money.
[01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:14.100]  Believe me.
[01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:16.780]  It is like, kudos to you for being an involved parent
[01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:18.500]  at the school, but you were like,
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:20.180]  will you give me like two days?
[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:21.020]  Yeah.
[01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:25.740]  Like, you took like two days and billed them a website,
[01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:26.580]  and now they pay-
[01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:27.860]  It took two hours indeed.
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:29.780]  Now they pay $8 a month.
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:31.660]  Yeah, instead of $3,000.
[01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:34.060]  Which, for a website, let's face it,
[01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:35.920]  who knows who they were gonna pay the 3,500 to,
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:36.760]  but you know what?
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.300]  It was probably gonna suck.
[01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:39.340]  Anyway, I love that story.
[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:40.620]  That was great.
[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:42.380]  Yeah, it's such a clear win for Squarespace.
[01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:44.480]  And now, and like, I'm not even the person
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:46.260]  who's responsible for keeping the website updated.
[01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:47.940]  Somebody else does that,
[01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:49.740]  and so it's important to like have something
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:53.140]  that they can use that isn't like my crappy CMS
[01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:55.480]  or some really complicated WordPress install.
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:57.260]  And then if they need support,
[01:15:57.260 --> 01:15:58.780]  I'm not their tech support.
[01:15:58.780 --> 01:16:00.020]  Squarespace is their tech support.
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:00.840]  Yeah, like-
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:01.680]  I'm totally out of it.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:04.020]  Like, I did my job, my job is done, my hands are clean,
[01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:06.300]  and it's all like their system now
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:07.860]  that they can do whatever they want to,
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:08.740]  and when they have a question,
[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:10.280]  they can get support from Squarespace and not me.
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:11.120]  It's perfect.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:13.900]  Yeah, 10 years ago, that same story might have been,
[01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:15.580]  you know, that you would have said,
[01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:17.340]  hey, hey, and then go sign them up
[01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:20.100]  for like an $8 a month hosting account
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:22.680]  and put up an install of WordPress
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:24.420]  and pick a theme and do this
[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:25.980]  and get like mostly the same thing.
[01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:27.100]  But that, you're exactly right though.
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:28.740]  Then like, like six months later
[01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:30.020]  and you're reading tech meme
[01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:32.780]  and there's like a big vulnerability in WordPress
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:34.400]  that was exposed and you're like,
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.300]  I don't think that's cool, that's cool.
[01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:38.480]  There's no way they know, and it's on you.
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:41.300]  Like whether you just like silently whistle
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:42.460]  and let the school keep going,
[01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:44.100]  or whether now you're, you know,
[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:46.300]  you're permanently on the hook for being like the,
[01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:47.940]  you know, the guy who's gonna fix it.
[01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:49.020]  Or they're like, hey, you know,
[01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:50.820]  we wanna add another widget to the sidebar.
[01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:51.740]  Can you do that for us?
[01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:53.780]  Cause there's no clear way for them to do it.
[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:54.620]  You know, stuff like that.
[01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:56.540]  Like it's just, it's so much better
[01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:58.660]  to just outsource this to Squarespace.
[01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:00.400]  The other thing I love about that anecdote of yours
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.900]  is I feel like it perfectly exemplifies
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:05.340]  why Squarespace advertises the way that they do.
[01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:07.000]  That the way that they advertise
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.280]  over and over and over again on shows like ours
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:11.220]  never used to make sense to me.
[01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:14.260]  But I think it's so that, you know,
[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:16.620]  how many people really need to make a website right now?
[01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:17.460]  Who knows?
[01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:18.300]  Probably very few.
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:20.580]  But how many over the course of the next year
[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:22.220]  are gonna find themselves in a situation
[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:23.540]  where they do need to make a website?
[01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:24.540]  And at that moment,
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:27.100]  if the first thing they think of is Squarespace,
[01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:28.160]  boom, they go there.
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:29.000]  Exactly.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.420]  Yeah, I think it works out very well for them that way.
[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:32.240]  Right.
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:33.080]  It's not about needing a website
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:34.140]  while you're listening to it on the show.
[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:35.360]  It's seeding it in your mind
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:38.060]  so that when you hit that situation
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:41.980]  where your school wants to spend $4,000 on a website
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:44.920]  that you say, no, don't do that.
[01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:48.740]  I wanna go back to what you were talking about.
[01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:50.460]  And here's the,
[01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:51.980]  I have this in my notes here for the show
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:53.540]  and talk about dev relations.
[01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:56.860]  And I think it's a big part of the problem
[01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:58.820]  that we're talking about here.
[01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:03.820]  And I think Apple's developer relations is overwhelmed.
[01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:06.480]  Now I don't know the numbers.
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:08.440]  And so it's this ballpark figure.
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:12.600]  But talking with somebody at Apple,
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:15.480]  their rough estimate is that
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:19.800]  Microsoft's developer relations team
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:24.480]  is somewhere between 10 and 50 times larger than Apple's.
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.200]  And I said, 50?
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:29.040]  And he was like, yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:31.080]  And if you're like a serious,
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:32.280]  and you might know more about this than I do.
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:33.200]  I've never been at,
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:37.200]  I've never written a goddamn line of code for Windows.
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:42.000]  But the basic idea is if you're a professional developer
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.280]  and doing some kind of serious work on Windows,
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:48.400]  you can get the attention of somebody competent
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.280]  and who can get stuff done
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:52.120]  on their developer relations team.
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:54.320]  And so if you're being driven up the wall
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.920]  by this obscure bug in a framework,
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.080]  you may not get a solution right away.
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:03.160]  And you certainly may not,
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:06.040]  you may not get a version of Windows release
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:08.240]  that has a fix for it right away.
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.520]  But you can at least get somebody's attention
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:13.780]  to get it in front of the right people.
[01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:14.880]  And it doesn't feel like
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:17.180]  when you're reporting things to Microsoft,
[01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:21.880]  it doesn't feel like you're just filing things
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.140]  into a black hole.
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:26.520]  And that Apple's developer relations,
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:27.800]  not that they're not well-meaning,
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:29.360]  but that they're just overwhelmed,
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:31.320]  absolutely positively overwhelmed.
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:36.320]  And it's like Microsoft's developer relations team
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:40.440]  is of a size that is appropriate for a company
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:44.380]  that had and saw as its rightful place
[01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:47.080]  that 90 some percent of all software in the world
[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:49.200]  is written for it.
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:51.120]  And Apple's developer relations
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.520]  is still of a scale of a company
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:56.680]  that has like three or 4% of the software in the world.
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:00.460]  Well, also like the whole structure of how,
[01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:02.300]  like how it's set up with the public
[01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:06.060]  or with the developers is radically different.
[01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:07.540]  Now, I don't know how Microsoft is set up,
[01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:09.160]  but the way Apple's is set up
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:13.760]  is it's fairly hostile at first.
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:17.660]  Like Apple appears to just be this brick wall
[01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:20.020]  that you have no way in.
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:21.900]  Like there is nowhere on,
[01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:23.320]  as far as I know,
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:25.500]  I don't think there's like, you know,
[01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:27.380]  a list or an email address to say like,
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:29.940]  hey, ask a developer evangelist a question.
[01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:31.820]  So I just searched,
[01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:34.120]  I've always wondered like,
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:35.600]  is there a public list anywhere
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:39.100]  of who the Apple evangelists even are?
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:42.340]  And if you search Google for Apple developer evangelists,
[01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:45.400]  nowhere on the first page is anything from Apple.
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:48.140]  There's a GitHub gist where somebody else,
[01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:51.900]  some random person just compiled the list from WDC
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:55.680]  and there's a bunch of question marks on it too.
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:21:00.680]  Like this, every year at WDC,
[01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:05.180]  you can always tell like in the first few days,
[01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:07.420]  if you look around some of the bigger sessions,
[01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:09.120]  the very last slide,
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:11.160]  they will show the presenter's name,
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:13.740]  their email address, and their title.
[01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:17.660]  That is usually the first time you see their title.
[01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:18.980]  It is almost certainly the first time
[01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:20.380]  you see their email address.
[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:21.300]  And you look around the room
[01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:23.780]  and when that slide is on screen for about eight seconds
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:25.820]  and you see half the room racing
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:27.180]  to write down that email address.
[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:28.260]  Taking pictures of it.
[01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:29.100]  Yeah.
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:31.900]  I see, I've noticed that in recent years now
[01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:33.120]  that nobody has an iPhone.
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:34.980]  Yeah, yeah, because like,
[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:38.160]  that's like the first time that most people see like,
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.460]  oh my God, there's an email address
[01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:41.180]  from somebody who works in Apple
[01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:43.740]  in the developer group somewhere that I can contact.
[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:46.300]  Plus I think people worry rightfully
[01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:49.360]  that they want to write it down or get a picture of it now
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:51.060]  because who knows if they're gonna cut it out
[01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:54.100]  of the published version of the video, right?
[01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:55.500]  They cut a lot out of those videos.
[01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:57.140]  Right, they cut mistakes out.
[01:21:57.140 --> 01:21:58.380]  Who knows if they, who knows?
[01:21:58.380 --> 01:21:59.780]  They cut out laughter and applause.
[01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:00.820]  They cut out a lot.
[01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:03.100]  Like if all of a sudden this guy gets overwhelmed
[01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:05.440]  with email, maybe they're gonna take his email out.
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:07.460]  So you better get it down while you can.
[01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:10.300]  I know exactly what you're talking about.
[01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:11.820]  Right, and that's weird.
[01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:16.220]  Like if these people's job is to interact with the public,
[01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:18.460]  with the developers at least, with the developer public
[01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:21.580]  about these frameworks and these areas of development,
[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:24.140]  there's no list on Apple's site anywhere that lists them?
[01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:25.620]  Like that's weird, isn't it?
[01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:28.700]  I don't think that it's malice.
[01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:30.740]  I don't think it's that they don't mean well.
[01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:32.820]  And in fact, the people I know in Apple developer relations
[01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:34.980]  for the most part are great people.
[01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:36.500]  And at least I've never met anybody
[01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:37.940]  who's like I would call unpleasant.
[01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:39.540]  I would say they're really sharp.
[01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:41.860]  I think that they are overwhelmed though.
[01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:44.520]  I think that they, I'm sure they've staffed up somewhat,
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:48.100]  but I think for the most part they're of a basic magnitude
[01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:52.500]  that was appropriate for Apple 10, 15 years ago.
[01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:55.220]  And now they're one of,
[01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:58.660]  if not the most popular developer platform in the world
[01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:00.460]  and they're just overwhelmed.
[01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:02.500]  Again, the number that I heard from somebody,
[01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:03.340]  again, a rough estimate,
[01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:08.340]  but that Microsoft's team is 10 to 50 times larger.
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:11.520]  Yeah, I mean, and this list on GitHub
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:13.100]  of who the evangelists are at Apple
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:14.740]  has like 12 people on it.
[01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:19.740]  It's a pretty small list and they are,
[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:22.080]  if they're overwhelmed that would explain a lot
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:27.080]  because even like there's developer relations managers
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:29.780]  or representatives, like people will say,
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:32.440]  oh, I talked to a developer rep or my developer rep.
[01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:36.720]  I don't know how you go about getting a developer rep.
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:40.920]  For the first, I don't know, five years that I had an app
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:44.140]  and the app for all of Instapaper and all of the magazine,
[01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:48.980]  I could never find one, no one ever contacted me.
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:52.680]  I didn't have a developer rep if that even is a thing.
[01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:57.680]  It wasn't until Overcast that somebody emailed me
[01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:00.520]  from some press thing like they reached out.
[01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:04.460]  And so it wasn't really until that
[01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:08.860]  that I had like a contact that I could email at Apple
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:12.500]  to like ask a question to or to bring a concern to.
[01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:15.820]  Like it wasn't until last year.
[01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:19.420]  And I've been in the app store since 2008.
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:24.820]  And when I mentioned this to the person, they.
[01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:28.620]  Let's just, and let's not mince words, with some success.
[01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:29.460]  Yeah.
[01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:33.740]  I mean, it's, again, I'm not, it's not like you wrote
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:36.140]  YouTube but pretty popular apps.
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:38.140]  Right, and yeah, it didn't matter.
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:40.040]  And when I mentioned this to this person
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:42.100]  that I had never found any contacts
[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:43.580]  in developer relations before,
[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:44.820]  they were like, they were surprised.
[01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:46.700]  They were like, really, are you sure?
[01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:48.400]  Like that, really, like that's,
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:50.500]  like they were even surprised at that.
[01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:52.740]  But like I don't think that people
[01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:55.700]  in the developer relations division,
[01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:57.940]  like I don't think they have a good idea
[01:24:57.940 --> 01:24:59.580]  of how it looks from the outside,
[01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:03.260]  of how the developer relations system
[01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:06.140]  and how Apple as a whole appears to
[01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:08.140]  and communicates with developers
[01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:10.820]  who are not in with somebody.
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:13.060]  The gist of it, what I've heard, and I believe it,
[01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:15.380]  and it definitely plays on developer relations,
[01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:17.700]  but they're so overwhelmed, developer relations,
[01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:21.420]  that the reps are just, and they're not, and not known,
[01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:24.380]  and hard to initiate contact with.
[01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:27.180]  And even once they do, it just never becomes a priority
[01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:30.320]  that the whole internal, I'm gonna call it radar,
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:32.900]  but maybe it's, maybe that's not just,
[01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:34.260]  maybe radar's just the database,
[01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:37.700]  but the whole radar system is entirely geared internally
[01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:41.860]  toward fixing bugs from within Apple itself, right?
[01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:43.420]  So if you're on, if you're writing,
[01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:45.120]  if you're one of the engineers on pages
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:48.180]  and you run into a text kit bug,
[01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:51.180]  it gets taken care of exactly as you would think,
[01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:52.540]  and it goes up the post,
[01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:54.900]  and it gets put in front of the right person,
[01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:56.800]  and they run your example project,
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.920]  and say, oh, I see, and fix it,
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:01.100]  and then, you know, it just works.
[01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:03.820]  It's all, but it's, there's nothing like that
[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:04.640]  from the outside.
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:09.640]  It's like 99% internal and like 1% external.
[01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:12.780]  And I'm not saying the balance should be 50-50.
[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:15.780]  You know, I think it's, you know, obvious that's,
[01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:17.940]  of course Apple's gonna fix their own bugs first,
[01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:21.300]  but it's just not even close.
[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:24.540]  And it's not even like, oh, poor us,
[01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:26.140]  poor third-party developers,
[01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:27.440]  we're not getting our bugs fixed.
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:29.620]  It's, these are things that affect users, everybody.
[01:26:29.620 --> 01:26:31.840]  You know, the bug, we're fighting for these bugs
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:34.980]  because they affect the experience of the users.
[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:36.040]  Right, exactly.
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:38.260]  I don't know.
[01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:40.380]  I mean, like, I don't know how you solve this problem
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:43.460]  except by making certain parts of Apple much bigger,
[01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:45.940]  and that's obviously not an easy thing to do.
[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:46.960]  Like, you know, there are all the, like,
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:48.280]  Mythical Man month kind of things.
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:50.380]  Like, you can't just staff up.
[01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:52.860]  I think it's a scary thing for them to do, too,
[01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:56.780]  because, you know, they've seen it over the, you know,
[01:26:56.780 --> 01:26:59.580]  everybody's seen this industry for 20 years,
[01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:02.100]  and everybody knows that Microsoft got a lot bigger,
[01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:05.900]  and then it got slow and lumbering.
[01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:08.180]  Right, and they also, you know,
[01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:10.980]  they're gonna have trouble staffing up, possibly,
[01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:14.860]  because when you work for Apple, you have, you know,
[01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:17.540]  you have to, first of all, you have to be there.
[01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:19.540]  Like, they don't do remote work for most things.
[01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:21.200]  They have a couple of remote offices
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:22.880]  for certain, like, isolated projects,
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:24.900]  but for the most part, they don't do remote work.
[01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:26.460]  So you have to be there.
[01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:28.820]  They're competing with everyone else
[01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:31.900]  in the Silicon Valley region for top talent,
[01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:34.820]  and that is extremely competitive.
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:39.820]  And I would imagine they probably have trouble
[01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:41.220]  retaining a lot of these good people,
[01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:44.060]  because, like, I mean, you know, we know tons of,
[01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:46.200]  tons of, like, our friends and people we knew at Apple
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:48.520]  who, like, they were at Apple for a while,
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:50.980]  and then they wanna go out and try being an iOS developer,
[01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:53.780]  or being a Mac developer themselves, like, independently,
[01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:54.720]  because when you're in Apple,
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:56.380]  you can't really have side projects.
[01:27:56.380 --> 01:28:00.100]  Yeah, and it's funny, I bet being a developer relations rep
[01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:02.060]  is even more easily poached,
[01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:04.500]  because your whole job is reaching out to other people,
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:06.060]  and they're gonna be like, wow, you're awesome,
[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:07.540]  why don't you come work for us?
[01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:08.360]  Right, yeah.
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:09.200]  I bet it happens, you know?
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:10.720]  Yeah, and if you're, if you are,
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:14.540]  if you're, like, an iOS expert who has worked for Apple,
[01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:16.100]  that's a pretty good qualifier.
[01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:19.340]  I would imagine it makes you pretty valuable on the market.
[01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:22.860]  So I expect that they probably have a lot of trouble
[01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:26.280]  first attracting and then retaining great talent there
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:29.900]  in addition to any cultural issues and challenges
[01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:31.820]  that would come with trying to grow the company
[01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:33.220]  substantially larger.
[01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:35.700]  So, but I don't really see a way around that
[01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:37.180]  being the eventual outcome.
[01:28:37.180 --> 01:28:40.580]  Like, I don't think they can keep the company
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:41.420]  the current size.
[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:43.260]  And I know they also have issues with, like,
[01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:44.420]  they don't have the space.
[01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:45.940]  Like, that's why they're building this giant new campus.
[01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:47.220]  Like, they're out of room, too.
[01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:49.340]  But, you know, it's, there's all these problems,
[01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:53.100]  but, you know, these problems aren't just gonna disappear.
[01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:56.540]  Like, and I think they are working towards that.
[01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:58.540]  I hope they're working towards that.
[01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:01.260]  But I think there's gonna be some uncomfortable migration,
[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:04.220]  uncomfortable growth as the company becomes
[01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:05.780]  a bigger organization.
[01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:07.020]  But I think it has to be.
[01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:09.900]  Yeah, and I think people are,
[01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:11.940]  third-party developers are exercising things
[01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:14.920]  that just don't get exercised within Apple, you know?
[01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:17.820]  I would say, like, the extensions
[01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:19.320]  are a perfect example of that.
[01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:22.140]  Like, the sharing extensions.
[01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:23.940]  Where Apple knew what they would be used for,
[01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:26.500]  but the things that Apple itself really wants in there,
[01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:28.420]  they were already there anyway.
[01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:31.060]  Because if Apple has collectively agreed,
[01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:33.020]  hey, this should be in the sharing extension for everybody,
[01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:36.280]  then it was built into the system's sharing panel.
[01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:38.800]  It was only when third-party developers started doing it.
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:41.580]  But that thing is so full of little tiny bugs.
[01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:43.060]  Like, the way that when you reorder them,
[01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:44.420]  the order doesn't stick.
[01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:46.160]  And there's, you know,
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:48.280]  just a bunch of little things like that.
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:49.500]  You know, it's just a perfect example
[01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:52.180]  of something that, to me, doesn't quite work right.
[01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:56.220]  Right, and there was a couple of little limitations
[01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:58.980]  that ended up having pretty big ramifications.
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:00.940]  I believe it was Brian Irace of Tumblr
[01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:04.540]  made a nice blog post right before iOS 8 came out,
[01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:06.220]  listing all the little challenges
[01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:07.940]  that they had with the Tumblr extension.
[01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:09.060]  Yes, it was Brian Irace.
[01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:10.300]  Yeah, and he did the right thing.
[01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:11.820]  He reported them all as radars
[01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:14.380]  and listed all the radar numbers in the post and everything.
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:18.980]  But, you know, like, they actually,
[01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:21.380]  I remember, well, I don't know if that's public.
[01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:22.220]  Anyway.
[01:30:22.220 --> 01:30:26.180]  What we learned building the iOS,
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:28.040]  Tumblr iOS share extension.
[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:29.460]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:32.360]  So it will be in the show notes.
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:34.420]  So we have, you know, the system itself,
[01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:37.280]  it has bugs, it has all these limitations.
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:38.700]  It's, you know, that's gotta get better.
[01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:39.960]  And, you know, hopefully it will.
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:41.220]  Over time, it probably will.
[01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:43.320]  But I think, you know,
[01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:45.480]  and all the stuff around the app rejection
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:48.100]  is pretty substantially worse too.
[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:49.300]  Like, all the rejections around this.
[01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:54.060]  I think what we're seeing is the policy
[01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:56.300]  from Apple is pretty clear.
[01:30:56.300 --> 01:31:00.760]  The policy is, the implied policy, rather,
[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:03.580]  is keyboards should not contain anything
[01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:04.780]  that isn't a keyboard.
[01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:07.020]  Like, you know, it shouldn't be able to do anything
[01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:09.920]  that is not, like, text entry.
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:10.940]  You know, it shouldn't be,
[01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:13.940]  it shouldn't have any other cool features built in,
[01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:15.380]  like a calculator built into your keyboard.
[01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:18.860]  Like, they obviously, like, this is the implied rule.
[01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:21.940]  Your keyboard should only be a keyboard of some sort.
[01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:23.020]  No extras.
[01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:25.580]  Can't put a version of desert golfing in as a keyboard.
[01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:26.420]  Correct.
[01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:29.340]  Similarly, your today view, your today extension
[01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:30.660]  or widget, whatever they're called,
[01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:35.660]  your today view should or must be, in general,
[01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:37.460]  a quick glance kind of thing.
[01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:39.580]  It shouldn't be the place where you spend time.
[01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:40.420]  It shouldn't be a place
[01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:42.760]  where you complete a long running task.
[01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:45.080]  It should just be a quick view.
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:47.140]  Those are the implied rules.
[01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:48.840]  But they won't come out and say that.
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:51.120]  Like, they won't codify that and say,
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:53.500]  this is the rule, it's a high level rule.
[01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:55.540]  This should only be used for this.
[01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:58.320]  Like, that's clearly what they want.
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:01.220]  But what they're saying instead is,
[01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:04.060]  well, we're gonna try to draw the line exactly where,
[01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:05.460]  like, more precisely where they should be,
[01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:06.580]  more lower level, and they're gonna say,
[01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:08.460]  well, you can't have buttons that launch your app,
[01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:09.720]  or you can't complete the task,
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:11.220]  or you can't have too many buttons,
[01:32:11.220 --> 01:32:12.440]  or you can't have this kind of button,
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:14.180]  or you can't simulate a keyboard in your today view.
[01:32:14.180 --> 01:32:15.420]  Like, they try to come up
[01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:17.900]  with all these little tiny explanations
[01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:21.060]  of lower level implementation detail rules.
[01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:24.540]  But that's clearly not, like, those are all just,
[01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:26.580]  you know, that is somebody not wanting
[01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:30.300]  to state the real rule, the higher level rule,
[01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:33.260]  which is, this system is intended only for this.
[01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:35.200]  You're only allowed to do this.
[01:32:36.860 --> 01:32:39.680]  And it's just not, I don't know.
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:41.860]  I don't know why they won't just say the higher level rule,
[01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:44.060]  because I think that would actually generate
[01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:46.300]  less controversy, and would be easier
[01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:48.260]  for developers to follow, and to know,
[01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:50.220]  like, certainly some developers would be like,
[01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:51.100]  well, does this count?
[01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:52.700]  But, you know, you see the high level rule,
[01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:54.380]  and that would at least give you some idea,
[01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:56.260]  like, if I stray from this,
[01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:58.700]  it's gonna be rocky territory, and a rejection risk.
[01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:01.100]  I think the App Store stuff definitely plays into it.
[01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:02.460]  I don't know how different that is
[01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:05.180]  from typical dev relations, but it ought to be tied up,
[01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:08.300]  because it's, in Apple's view, the App Store is,
[01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:11.160]  and for iOS, it absolutely is the only way,
[01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:13.540]  other than the enterprise stuff.
[01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:15.020]  You know, it's the only way.
[01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:17.620]  It's an inextricable part of the development process.
[01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:19.680]  So, App Store problems should be considered
[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:21.860]  developer relation problems.
[01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:24.120]  The whole thing, like with the recent things,
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:25.780]  Panic has gone through.
[01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:28.220]  And, like, where they had the issue
[01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:33.220]  with their saving feature in Transmit,
[01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:35.060]  where, you know, they didn't want them
[01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:36.940]  to be able to save to iCloud Drive,
[01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:38.380]  and therefore they had to take the whole thing out,
[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:39.940]  because even the stuff that hooks up
[01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:41.820]  to Dropbox and Box.net,
[01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:43.780]  because there's no control over that.
[01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:46.700]  And then, you know, I wrote about it,
[01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:48.100]  a couple other people wrote about it,
[01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:51.060]  and then, you know, Saner mines prevailed,
[01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:52.660]  and okay, they got it fixed.
[01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:54.740]  And there's this whole angle that everybody agrees on.
[01:33:54.740 --> 01:33:57.260]  Everybody, that you shouldn't have to have,
[01:33:57.260 --> 01:34:00.660]  you know, Daring Fireball publish it
[01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:03.060]  to get your story fixed.
[01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:05.000]  You shouldn't have to go public to get that.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  And you shouldn't have to be of the prominence of Panic.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.220]  To do that, you know, like some upstart
[01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:16.340]  who nobody's heard of yet should be able to get this,
[01:34:16.340 --> 01:34:20.020]  you know, the same reasonable correction
[01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:22.500]  with an App Store problem that Panic got.
[01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:24.620]  Right, and they have,
[01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:27.300]  they have the appeal system set up there.
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:29.780]  So, like, in theory, it should work.
[01:34:29.780 --> 01:34:31.580]  You should be able to go to the appeal,
[01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:33.700]  which, like, you know, from what I understand,
[01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:35.560]  so, you know, you have the reviewers on one level,
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:36.400]  and from what I understand,
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:38.020]  the appeal doesn't just go to the same people.
[01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:40.180]  It goes to, like, a level above those people.
[01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:43.700]  And so, if some reviewer just made a bad call,
[01:34:43.700 --> 01:34:45.200]  the appeal should work.
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:48.280]  The system that's in place there should work.
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:51.580]  The question is, why doesn't it work as well
[01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:52.460]  as running to the press?
[01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:55.580]  Like, running to the press and making a big stink,
[01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:57.700]  yeah, that's gonna work just by the way PR works.
[01:34:57.700 --> 01:34:58.860]  That's gonna work a little bit better,
[01:34:58.860 --> 01:34:59.700]  you know, on occasion.
[01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:02.380]  But it shouldn't work so much better.
[01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:05.540]  It shouldn't be, like, and Panic even said,
[01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:06.700]  I mean, Panic will say these things
[01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:08.460]  in the nicest way possible,
[01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:11.480]  because, you know, they don't wanna start on any stuff,
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:14.860]  but, you know, they even said, like, it's unfortunate,
[01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:17.780]  but, you know, this method is what works.
[01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:20.000]  Yeah, and we've gotten, at Q branch,
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.420]  we've gotten bugs fixed,
[01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:23.880]  because we know people who work on the framework
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:26.120]  that we're having the problem with.
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:30.780]  And we could, you know, I think literally at WWDC,
[01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:33.140]  Brent had, like, coffee with somebody
[01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:35.020]  and showed the example project,
[01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:37.420]  which he had already submitted months ago in a radar,
[01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:40.580]  you know, here's a simple 13-line example project
[01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:42.020]  that shows the bug exactly.
[01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:45.380]  But he got to show it to a guy from the framework team,
[01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:48.460]  right in his face, you know, not a confrontation,
[01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:50.300]  you know, Brent, but it was like drinking, you know,
[01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:51.620]  drinking coffee at the hotel bar.
[01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:53.100]  And the guy was like, oh, I see.
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:54.200]  Oh, I bet I know what that is.
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:55.860]  And he, like, you know, made a note of it.
[01:35:55.860 --> 01:35:58.020]  And, but you shouldn't have to know somebody
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:36:00.140]  and have coffee with an engineer.
[01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:01.700]  You know, it's just because Brent knew that,
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:03.460]  you know, knew him for years.
[01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:07.220]  That doesn't scale, to say that that doesn't scale is,
[01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:09.920]  you know, self-evident.
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:11.700]  Right, I mean, so you have,
[01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:15.220]  in the reality of the iOS ecosystem and the Mac,
[01:36:15.220 --> 01:36:17.500]  the reality of the Apple dev ecosystem
[01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:20.900]  is that you have the official channels up
[01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:23.980]  that are just this tremendous wall and filter.
[01:36:23.980 --> 01:36:26.500]  And, you know, and what you said earlier makes sense
[01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:28.460]  that they are extremely understaffed in these areas
[01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:30.220]  or they're not scaling very well.
[01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:34.260]  That explains a lot because it seems like
[01:36:34.260 --> 01:36:37.460]  where the general public is shown to go
[01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:39.960]  is just a wall that is extremely ineffective,
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:44.300]  has very few ways in, and it is just very off-putting
[01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:48.300]  and just, you know, they're trying to deflect everyone.
[01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:49.780]  It's like when you call a big company
[01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:51.420]  and you get put on hold for 35 minutes
[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:52.860]  on some touch-tone menu that really wants you
[01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:54.360]  to follow with self-help options.
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:58.140]  Like, they don't want you to get in through the public way
[01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:00.400]  because they can't handle it all.
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:03.020]  Then you have all of us going through like the side door
[01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:05.980]  because we know somebody and that ends up working better.
[01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:07.020]  That's not good.
[01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:09.020]  Like, that should be embarrassing.
[01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:10.940]  That should be a major problem they need to fix.
[01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:13.340]  It seems like something they could fix because, you know,
[01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:15.340]  like, and again, I think the biggest problem
[01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:18.100]  is what you said, which is just that hiring talented people
[01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:21.940]  in general is hard and it's especially hard in the Valley.
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:25.340]  But, you know, guess what works?
[01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:26.820]  Money, and guess what Apple has?
[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:27.660]  They have money.
[01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:31.340]  So, I can't help but think it is fixable.
[01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:33.820]  Well, and, you know, who's to say they have
[01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:35.940]  to always keep everybody in Cupertino, right?
[01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:38.780]  Like, there are parts of their business
[01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:41.460]  that can be easily at some other location.
[01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:43.380]  Like, I work as in Pittsburgh.
[01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:45.540]  Like, there are parts of Apple's business
[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:46.860]  that can be other places.
[01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:49.340]  And I think Gus was saying they're opening up
[01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:51.320]  an office in Seattle, wasn't it?
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:53.540]  So, like, it looks like they might be starting
[01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:56.300]  to be more willing to branch this out a little bit, but.
[01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:58.060]  Yeah, and I think the Seattle office is gonna be
[01:37:58.060 --> 01:37:59.900]  cloud stuff, I don't know.
[01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:01.500]  Yeah, that's the rumor, I don't know if we have
[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:03.940]  any good info on that yet, but yeah.
[01:38:03.940 --> 01:38:08.820]  So, like, I think, you know, they need to start
[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:11.580]  breaking down some of these barriers with themselves
[01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:14.300]  of, like, the way they've always done things
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:16.940]  or the kind of, or the rules they have internally.
[01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:18.900]  Like, if they say everyone has to work on site,
[01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:22.460]  you better make more sites and more places
[01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:26.100]  because that's, like, they have to become a bigger company.
[01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:29.240]  There are so many areas where they are clearly understaffed
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:31.800]  or under-resourced, and as you said, it's not for money.
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:35.580]  Like, it's not because of money, as far as we can tell.
[01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:38.780]  Unless they foresee a near-term future
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:40.260]  where they're not going to have so many
[01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:42.340]  third-party developers, and I don't see
[01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:43.780]  how they could possibly think that
[01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:46.820]  because it doesn't seem, I don't see how that's possible,
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:50.580]  they really need a bigger developer relations team,
[01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:53.240]  much bigger, like, factor of 10,
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:57.040]  with not just headcount but with authority
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:00.720]  within the company to get issues escalated
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:03.020]  and put in front of the right people.
[01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:04.480]  And as this week has gone on,
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:06.440]  and this has been the topic of the week,
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:09.800]  I'm thinking, my thinking has shifted more and more
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:13.140]  that it's a lot more a developer relations problem
[01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:15.880]  and a lot less due to what I initially
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:17.240]  had been thinking for a long time,
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:20.140]  which is the annual release cycle of the two OSs.
[01:39:20.140 --> 01:39:22.400]  Well, I think those are two different problems.
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:27.120]  I mean, I do too, and I think it's clearly multivariable,
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:29.780]  and those are both definitely two of the variables,
[01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:31.880]  absolutely, but my thinking has shifted
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:35.280]  in terms of which one is a bigger problem.
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:39.840]  And I think, too, which one, to my eyes,
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:44.400]  meshes with the timeline of what I'm seeing.
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:48.600]  I think that it's, as iOS has gotten more complicated
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:51.660]  and therefore there are more things that could go wrong,
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:57.560]  and as the ratio of developers
[01:39:58.140 --> 01:40:00.820]  to developer relations people within Apple
[01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:03.280]  has gotten more and more absurd,
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:05.920]  that correlates to me, to my eyes,
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:08.640]  with the shift in quality.
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:11.040]  And again, I think Hockenberry nailed it.
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:13.120]  It's like loose screws.
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:16.240]  It's the software equivalent of loose screws.
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:19.320]  Yeah, just like sloppy little flaws that aren't fatal,
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:23.000]  but yeah, I mean, and I think these problems
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.320]  are intertwined, you know, like it's hard to say,
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:28.960]  well, developer relations is responsible
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:31.040]  for a general decline in quality
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:32.520]  in Apple software and services.
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:34.520]  Right, that's too simple, that's way too simple.
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:37.760]  Right, but you can look at certain parts.
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:41.120]  You can say like, well, if they're saying
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:43.960]  that they're not seeing more bugs being reported
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:45.600]  and therefore they don't know what problems to fix,
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:47.320]  they don't have enough information to fix them,
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:49.460]  why aren't more bugs being reported?
[01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:51.000]  And then you can start following that rabbit hole,
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.680]  be like, oh, well, actually,
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:54.260]  this is related to developer relations
[01:40:54.260 --> 01:40:56.120]  or related to the bug reporter system
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:58.760]  or related to the image Apple has among developers
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:00.280]  and the personality, like,
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:03.240]  because the personality of individual people
[01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:06.360]  within Apple I've spoken with or that I know
[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:08.400]  couldn't possibly be more different
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:10.480]  than the public persona of Apple.
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:12.960]  The public persona of Apple is, as I said,
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:15.180]  it's a brick wall and it's pretty terse
[01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:18.680]  and it's pretty unwelcoming to developers
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:21.640]  and to public input of any kind, really.
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:25.160]  But the individual people I've met and spoken with at Apple
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:26.040]  are the complete opposite.
[01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:27.520]  They're friendly, normal people.
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:29.040]  They're a lot of our friends.
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:31.440]  So why is that disconnect there?
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:32.280]  And can-
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:34.240]  They take enormous pride in their work.
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:36.160]  If you are lucky enough to get your bug
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:37.560]  in front of the person who can,
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:39.320]  like an engineer who can fix it,
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:40.920]  they're gonna take care of it.
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:43.160]  They are offended by any and all bugs.
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:45.720]  Right, because they're good engineers.
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:47.360]  So what is the disconnect here?
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:49.220]  Is it a process issue?
[01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:50.760]  Is it a policy issue?
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:54.040]  Is it just like inertia going in the wrong direction
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:54.860]  in certain things?
[01:41:54.860 --> 01:41:55.700]  I don't know.
[01:41:55.700 --> 01:42:00.700]  But the issues at Apple are seemingly deep rooted.
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:03.440]  It's something that's like not budging, you know,
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:05.560]  like some part of the culture inside
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:08.020]  or the process, the way things are done,
[01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:12.360]  is it needs to be modernized and it hasn't been yet.
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:13.920]  And that's not an easy thing to do.
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:14.960]  You know, that's, I mean,
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:16.360]  I don't know anything about big companies, but-
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:20.840]  I wonder how much too that the historical artifacts
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:23.320]  of the size of their developer relations team
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:24.920]  being relatively small,
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:27.440]  how much of that relates to not just the fact
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:29.880]  that 10, 15, 20 years ago,
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:32.520]  Apple was A, a smaller company,
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:34.400]  B, had far fewer users,
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:36.520]  and C, had far fewer developers,
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:41.000]  but also with the peculiar nature of the third party
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  to modernize, peculiar to our current eyes,
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.040]  of that it was dominated by just like three
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:50.320]  or four huge companies, Adobe, Microsoft,
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:54.480]  you know, go so far as the macro media,
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:57.180]  you know, just a hand, you know,
[01:42:57.180 --> 01:42:58.860]  maybe more than four or five, but you know,
[01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:02.940]  that you just 10, 11, 12 big, big developers
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:05.320]  who I think, and by all accounts that I've heard,
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:07.180]  you know, did have, you know,
[01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:10.900]  like platinum card developer relations treatment
[01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:13.520]  from Apple and that they were,
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:15.920]  they're sort of built up for that sort of world.
[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:19.320]  Yeah, and that's a very, very good point.
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:21.560]  I mean, and it seems like a lot of Apple,
[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:24.980]  like even if you look at like the SVP roles,
[01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:29.980]  you know, why is the entire developer relations system
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:32.120]  under the head of marketing?
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:35.720]  Why is the entire cloud infrastructure system,
[01:43:36.580 --> 01:43:38.160]  why is the same guy responsible
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:40.120]  for the entire cloud infrastructure system
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:42.740]  and also negotiating deals with record labels?
[01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:47.740]  Like, I think they need to get wider as an organization.
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:50.900]  They need like more divisions and they need each,
[01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:52.220]  they need some of these divisions to have like,
[01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:54.920]  you know, more power at the top or more say,
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:57.360]  and you know, like that's what, like I said,
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:43:59.560]  I tweeted a while ago, like if you wanna see
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:02.340]  areas where Apple doesn't do so well,
[01:44:02.340 --> 01:44:05.300]  look at which SVPs have way too much on their plate.
[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:06.140]  Yeah.
[01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:06.980]  Well, I think-
[01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:09.440]  And again, I don't think it's like personal.
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:11.440]  Like I don't think Phil Schiller and Eddy Cue
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:13.160]  are, you know, weak at their jobs.
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:14.520]  I'm saying like,
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:16.680]  if that's the way the organization is structured,
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:18.600]  where all these things are under like, you know,
[01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:22.280]  the like fairly disparate things are under one organization
[01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:24.720]  with one person representing them at the top,
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:26.960]  I think that's too much on their plate.
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.360]  Yeah, if anything,
[01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:29.960]  it's that they're effective at their jobs.
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:32.780]  I mean, I mean, it was explicit.
[01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:35.400]  It was a rare instance where they publicly said,
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:38.760]  like when they added maps to Eddy Cue's plate,
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:39.840]  it, you know,
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.360]  that usually they don't make announcements
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:42.180]  like that publicly,
[01:44:42.180 --> 01:44:44.080]  but the whole forced all thing was, you know,
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:45.800]  had to be done somewhat publicly.
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:48.800]  And the explanation was Eddy, you know, gets stuff done.
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:51.560]  So maps needs stuff done, so now it's Eddy's.
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:52.860]  And, you know, truth be told,
[01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:55.320]  maps has gotten significantly better.
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:56.160]  Yeah.
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:57.520]  People still, people point to maps.
[01:44:57.520 --> 01:44:59.120]  Maps is a bad example, in my opinion,
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:00.760]  because maps is a product that I think
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:03.000]  is clearly headed in the right direction.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.540]  Is it possible that it could be headed
[01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:05.520]  in that direction faster?
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:09.160]  I guess, of course you can always do somewhat better.
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:12.160]  And is it as good quality wise as Google Maps?
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:14.000]  No, but that's, I think that's mainly
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.160]  because Google still has the pedal to the metal
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:20.040]  on Google Maps and Google is improving Google Maps
[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:21.780]  at a very quick rate.
[01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:26.780]  And so Apple Maps might lag behind it for years to come
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:29.320]  until they sort of get to the, you know,
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:31.460]  the point of diminishing returns where they're both,
[01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:34.100]  you know, as close to perfect as they can get.
[01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:35.360]  I think maps is a bad example
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:36.880]  because I think they're getting a lot better at maps.
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:40.080]  Well, I disagree with the chances of maps being,
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:41.600]  you know, eventually tying up with Google Maps
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:45.620]  because like those kind of large big data problems,
[01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:48.040]  Apple has never shown that they're very good at them.
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:51.620]  They, where I think Apple gets a bum rap
[01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:54.080]  is the general cloud services term.
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:56.160]  I think maps today, Apple Maps today
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:58.820]  is already better than Google Maps was a few years ago.
[01:45:58.820 --> 01:46:00.360]  I'm not quite sure how many a few is.
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:01.200]  I don't know about that.
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:05.760]  But I get, I used to get bad driving directions
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:08.200]  from Google Maps, you know, it was always better.
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:10.600]  It was just like with search where I was,
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:12.760]  I guess I used MapQuest before.
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:14.200]  And right when I switched to Google Maps,
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:15.620]  it was like, this is better.
[01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:17.200]  And it wouldn't do stupid things
[01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:20.540]  like getting me from my house to, you know, I-95.
[01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:23.700]  It's like, you know, gave me reasonable directions
[01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:25.660]  for the first few steps of a trip.
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:28.440]  In my experience, I mean, again,
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:29.680]  this is the sort of thing where everybody,
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:31.280]  depending on where you live, might be having
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:33.040]  different results, but I think Apple Maps
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:35.080]  is already better than Google Maps used to be
[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:36.460]  some number of years ago.
[01:46:36.460 --> 01:46:38.800]  It's not as good as Google Maps is today,
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:40.440]  but it's getting there.
[01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:41.940]  I, like, I don't think that it's,
[01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:43.880]  I think it's already good enough that it's proof
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:46.240]  that they can do a large data set problem
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:48.420]  to some degree of quality.
[01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:50.200]  Maybe, I don't know, then I look at App Store Search
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:53.360]  and I cry, but I think overall, you know, Apple-
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:55.800]  Well, that's a, see, now that is a great example.
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:56.640]  Let's forget about that.
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:58.680]  But App Store Search is a great example
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:00.520]  of something that's always been shit,
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:04.360]  is still shit, and there's no evidence at all
[01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:05.600]  that they're getting better at it
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:07.600]  or that they've hired anybody, you know.
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:10.360]  To me, the solution is so obvious.
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:12.600]  Just find someone who's done a good work
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:14.720]  at, like, Bing or Google Search,
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:18.480]  and hire a team of, you know, poach a team of engineers
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:22.100]  with experience at one of the successful search engines.
[01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:25.280]  I think the problem there is, you know,
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:27.900]  in general, the App Store, like, the store itself,
[01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:29.360]  not, like, the politics that go on behind it,
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:31.960]  but, like, the store itself, the interface to the store,
[01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:35.000]  the infrastructure that runs the store,
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.200]  the store apps themselves, the categories in the store,
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:40.720]  the ability that the store pages have,
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:42.680]  like, the different fields, the descriptions,
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:44.040]  you know, like, all this stuff,
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:47.040]  that stuff changes incredibly slowly.
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:48.920]  A lot of it has never changed.
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:52.960]  It, like, the App Store, it seems like-
[01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:56.320]  The install button for the Yosemite App Store
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:58.720]  still looks like the old Mac OS.
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:03.040]  Right, yeah, and boy, if you think the iOS App Store app
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:04.320]  is a little rough around the edges,
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:07.040]  the Mac App Store app is pretty rough.
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:10.000]  That's been a frequent source of bugs.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.640]  It's just rough.
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:15.320]  The iPhone one is the least bad.
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:18.220]  The iPad one is kind of pretty bad,
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:20.320]  and the Mac one is really bad.
[01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:23.480]  But anyway, like, all that stuff, it seems like,
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:26.960]  I don't think this is an instance of, like,
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:29.760]  this team needs 50 more engineers.
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:33.320]  I think it's an instance of Apple thinks
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:34.920]  this is good enough.
[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:37.260]  And that's what frustrates me about the App Store
[01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:39.240]  and its various quality issues.
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:40.980]  Anyway, I'm not talking about, like, you know,
[01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:42.320]  the policies in this case.
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:43.520]  I'm actually talking about the store,
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:46.000]  like, the actual App Store itself.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.440]  There are so many things they could do
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:48.880]  that would make it better
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:51.380]  that they seem to think they don't need to do.
[01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:55.760]  But overall, though, I think Apple's cloud services
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:56.740]  get a bum rap.
[01:48:56.740 --> 01:49:01.740]  I think if you look at what we do on our Apple devices
[01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:05.180]  that rely on Apple's cloud services,
[01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:07.820]  most of it just works fine.
[01:49:07.820 --> 01:49:10.380]  And it's, again, it's that error rate multiplier thing.
[01:49:10.380 --> 01:49:13.660]  Like, the edges stick out, and then we all scream and say,
[01:49:13.660 --> 01:49:15.100]  Apple's cloud services suck.
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:16.380]  But the reality is, like, most of them,
[01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:19.280]  like, the biggest, as far as I know,
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:20.820]  what I would expect, at least,
[01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:22.980]  the biggest Apple cloud service
[01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:26.900]  is the system that delivers push notifications and iMessage.
[01:49:26.900 --> 01:49:29.140]  And that works extremely well.
[01:49:29.140 --> 01:49:31.480]  And if you think about the scale that that's operating on,
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:32.580]  that's insane.
[01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:35.820]  Like, the amount of messages that get delivered,
[01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:38.140]  and, like, all my interactions with that service
[01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:42.520]  as a developer, like, the servers that take in push requests
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:44.140]  are just lightning fast.
[01:49:44.140 --> 01:49:46.740]  Like, it will take requests as quickly
[01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:49.380]  as your network can stream them to it.
[01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:51.540]  And it never fails.
[01:49:51.540 --> 01:49:53.380]  I've never had a connection error reported
[01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:55.220]  by any of those tasks that run on my servers.
[01:49:55.220 --> 01:49:59.660]  Like, at least one that wasn't my fault on my network.
[01:49:59.660 --> 01:50:03.200]  It is ridiculous how well that system works.
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:04.700]  From what I've heard, CloudKit works.
[01:50:04.700 --> 01:50:05.740]  I mean, I haven't used it yet,
[01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:07.500]  but from what I've heard, CloudKit works.
[01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:10.860]  Like, this new infrastructure that they built CloudKit on,
[01:50:10.860 --> 01:50:13.060]  that they're building all the photo library stuff on,
[01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:15.040]  all the indications so far, it is a little early,
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:18.740]  but all the indications so far say that that's rock solid.
[01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:21.780]  So it does seem like most of their cloud services
[01:50:21.780 --> 01:50:23.980]  do work and are solid,
[01:50:23.980 --> 01:50:26.620]  but you definitely hear about the ones that don't.
[01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:27.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:29.300]  So I think the people who are holding that stuff up
[01:50:29.300 --> 01:50:32.860]  as examples of this are, I think they're wrong.
[01:50:32.860 --> 01:50:34.180]  Let me take a break, and I want to talk,
[01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:35.340]  I guess the last thing we could talk about
[01:50:35.340 --> 01:50:36.820]  would be the annual schedule.
[01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:41.100]  And maybe we can talk about that crazy new MacBook
[01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:43.220]  that Mark Gurman says is coming.
[01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:45.100]  That's gonna be weird.
[01:50:45.100 --> 01:50:46.860]  You know we're both gonna buy one.
[01:50:46.860 --> 01:50:48.100]  No, I don't want to, no.
[01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:49.860]  Because I just bought a MacBook Pro.
[01:50:49.860 --> 01:50:50.940]  You say that now.
[01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:54.220]  No, my MacBook Pro is what I want.
[01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:56.180]  Well, do you still have your 11 inch?
[01:50:56.180 --> 01:50:57.780]  I do, I'm actually recording this,
[01:50:57.780 --> 01:51:02.440]  but literally all I use it for is to record the show
[01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:05.780]  and to take a look at anything.
[01:51:05.780 --> 01:51:10.060]  It's still running 10.9, so to take a look at anything
[01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:13.020]  in the old UI that I wanna, what was it like when you,
[01:51:13.020 --> 01:51:14.520]  what did we do before Yosemite?
[01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:15.360]  Right.
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:16.620]  The only two things I use this machine for.
[01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:18.940]  Does it look totally garish and outdated now?
[01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:20.580]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:22.140]  It's been such a short time.
[01:51:22.140 --> 01:51:26.060]  Yeah, looking at 10.9 is, oh my God, it's ridiculous.
[01:51:26.060 --> 01:51:30.220]  It's not quite as ridiculous as looking at pre-iOS 7, iOS,
[01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:33.580]  but it's, because they never quite blinged,
[01:51:33.580 --> 01:51:36.700]  or they de-blinged it at one point and left it there.
[01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:39.340]  It's even worse when, so you now use
[01:51:39.340 --> 01:51:40.980]  a Retina iMac full time, right?
[01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:41.820]  Right.
[01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:45.780]  So how bad is it when you see a non-Retina screen now?
[01:51:45.780 --> 01:51:48.860]  That's, well, my 11-inch has the non-Retina screen
[01:51:48.860 --> 01:51:50.100]  and it's like, ugh.
[01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:52.060]  Yeah, I did, I got a Mac Mini
[01:51:52.060 --> 01:51:54.420]  for some auxiliary duties here.
[01:51:54.420 --> 01:51:58.420]  It runs headless, but we have an old 27-inch LED,
[01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:01.180]  whatever, cinema display in the closet,
[01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:02.900]  so I took that out to set it up.
[01:52:02.900 --> 01:52:05.060]  And so I had, so I kept going back and forth
[01:52:05.060 --> 01:52:07.700]  between my 27-inch Retina iMac
[01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:08.940]  and the 27-inch Thunderbolt display,
[01:52:08.940 --> 01:52:11.420]  which at the time it came out was an amazing display.
[01:52:11.420 --> 01:52:12.320]  They still sell it.
[01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:13.780]  It's now, well, now it's Thunderbolt.
[01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:14.940]  I have the pre one anyway.
[01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:15.780]  Yeah, it's the same panel.
[01:52:15.780 --> 01:52:17.380]  It's an amazing display, yeah.
[01:52:17.380 --> 01:52:20.600]  Like incredibly good, like bright, nice colors,
[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:23.140]  great brightness, great contrast.
[01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:25.020]  By all specs, it is an amazing display.
[01:52:25.020 --> 01:52:28.620]  And when it came out, I remember I had some other HP monitor
[01:52:28.620 --> 01:52:30.180]  and I looked at the tool, I'm like, oh my God,
[01:52:30.180 --> 01:52:31.540]  my HP monitor looks like crap compared
[01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:33.260]  to this wonderful Apple monitor.
[01:52:33.260 --> 01:52:36.060]  And now that I have the Retina version
[01:52:36.060 --> 01:52:37.560]  of that same thing, basically,
[01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:41.340]  going between the two, as I was setting up the,
[01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:43.740]  the first time I saw the Thunderbolt one,
[01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:45.120]  the non-Retina one, I'm like,
[01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:46.560]  oh, is this the wrong resolution?
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:48.020]  Like, what is wrong with this?
[01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:49.060]  It looks terrible.
[01:52:49.060 --> 01:52:51.220]  Like what, oh my God, this was normal.
[01:52:51.220 --> 01:52:52.460]  I looked at this all day.
[01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:55.980]  Like it's, I know this sounds awful,
[01:52:55.980 --> 01:52:58.660]  but it's such a difference.
[01:52:58.660 --> 01:52:59.980]  But yeah, I would imagine, yeah,
[01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:02.760]  like looking back at Mavericks,
[01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:04.260]  once you're accustomed to Yosemite,
[01:53:04.260 --> 01:53:06.260]  it probably looks quite ridiculous.
[01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:07.100]  Yeah.
[01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:08.700]  The other thing that makes me think I might not like,
[01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:10.820]  if assuming that the Gurman thing is true,
[01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:12.500]  that, well, we'll talk about it in a second.
[01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:13.340]  Yeah, all right.
[01:53:13.340 --> 01:53:16.380]  I don't think I would like the keyboard.
[01:53:16.380 --> 01:53:17.220]  I'm concerned, yeah,
[01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:18.480]  because it's too close together, right?
[01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:19.640]  Yeah, and that's the thing I never liked
[01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:20.780]  about my 11-inch Air.
[01:53:20.780 --> 01:53:22.620]  And not, I don't even know if it's close enough,
[01:53:22.620 --> 01:53:24.140]  but it doesn't have the key travel
[01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:25.940]  that the bigger PowerBooks do.
[01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:28.220]  And it's one of the nice- Oh, it doesn't?
[01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:29.940]  No, well, at least mine didn't.
[01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:33.860]  I got the, my 11-inch Air is the last Air
[01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:36.060]  that doesn't have keys that light up.
[01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:37.300]  Yeah, you have the 2010.
[01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:38.140]  Yeah.
[01:53:38.140 --> 01:53:38.960]  It was the only one that ever,
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:40.260]  it was only, like the first one did,
[01:53:40.260 --> 01:53:43.080]  the 2008 old crappy one, that did light up.
[01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:45.020]  Then the 2010 ones initially didn't,
[01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:46.540]  and then they brought it back in 2011.
[01:53:46.540 --> 01:53:47.740]  No, the keys, when you press them,
[01:53:47.740 --> 01:53:50.660]  don't go as far down as on other PowerBooks.
[01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:52.100]  And it's the nicest,
[01:53:52.100 --> 01:53:53.940]  probably the single nicest thing about the,
[01:53:53.940 --> 01:53:55.220]  well, the screen's the nicest thing,
[01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:57.760]  but the second nicest thing after the Retina screen
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:53:59.020]  is the keyboard.
[01:53:59.020 --> 01:54:00.300]  Oh, that's totally news to me.
[01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:02.380]  I thought that they all used the same part,
[01:54:02.380 --> 01:54:03.940]  like all the current Apple Apple,
[01:54:03.940 --> 01:54:06.060]  I thought the keyboard was the exact same in all of them.
[01:54:06.060 --> 01:54:07.220]  You know, and for obvious reasons,
[01:54:07.220 --> 01:54:10.100]  the main thing I use a PowerBook for instead of,
[01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:11.540]  or I still call them PowerBooks,
[01:54:11.540 --> 01:54:13.180]  the main thing I use a MacBook for
[01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:16.260]  instead of an iPad in any situation is typing.
[01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:18.340]  So, the nice keyboard, really.
[01:54:18.340 --> 01:54:19.180]  So I'm worried about that.
[01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:21.500]  Anyway, let me tell you about our third sponsor.
[01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:23.020]  It's another longtime friend of the show.
[01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:25.300]  It's our friends at Harry's.
[01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:28.660]  Harry's sells high quality,
[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:32.980]  I would say the highest quality men's shaving stuff,
[01:54:32.980 --> 01:54:35.020]  and they sell it at amazing prices.
[01:54:37.060 --> 01:54:38.780]  The basic gist, you've heard the backstory,
[01:54:38.780 --> 01:54:41.880]  but the basic gist is that the founders of Harry's
[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:43.180]  just ask themselves one day,
[01:54:43.180 --> 01:54:45.740]  why the hell is it so hard and so expensive
[01:54:45.740 --> 01:54:48.500]  to buy razors?
[01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:49.660]  Why, when you go into a drug store,
[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:51.200]  do you have to find like a clerk
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:54.100]  who can unlock a glass cabinet and get it out?
[01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:55.380]  I mean, you know why they lock them up.
[01:54:55.380 --> 01:54:57.380]  It's shoplifting, I guess.
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:55:00.500]  But it just makes buying it a whole pain in the ass.
[01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:02.480]  And why are the blades so expensive?
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:07.300]  So they started a company to disrupt the market,
[01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:10.060]  and they take it super, super seriously.
[01:55:10.060 --> 01:55:14.660]  They bought their own razor blade factory in Germany.
[01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:17.160]  They found a razor blade factory making high quality blades.
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:18.160]  They bought it.
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:19.340]  They're making their own blades.
[01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:21.300]  It's not just some kind of white label.
[01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:22.820]  They don't just scribble the name Harry's
[01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:25.740]  on a bunch of blades they just buy on the market.
[01:55:25.740 --> 01:55:27.140]  They buy high quality stuff.
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:29.820]  They make high quality stuff.
[01:55:29.820 --> 01:55:31.540]  The handles are great.
[01:55:31.540 --> 01:55:33.460]  Everything about the product is great.
[01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:35.380]  When you snap the blade into the handle,
[01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:36.780]  it has a nice click.
[01:55:36.780 --> 01:55:38.420]  It comes in a nice box.
[01:55:38.420 --> 01:55:40.200]  I've said before, I always feel terrible
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:41.660]  throwing away the Harry's box
[01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:43.940]  because it just looks like the type of box,
[01:55:43.940 --> 01:55:44.940]  it's like an apple box.
[01:55:44.940 --> 01:55:46.980]  Like nobody throws away their apple boxes.
[01:55:47.980 --> 01:55:51.540]  But then I think, well, now my bathroom
[01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:53.540]  is filled with empty Harry's boxes.
[01:55:53.540 --> 01:55:55.700]  But trust me, that's how good this stuff is.
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:55:58.660]  Really great stuff.
[01:55:58.660 --> 01:55:59.980]  They've got good shaving cream,
[01:55:59.980 --> 01:56:02.680]  aftershave, stuff that smells good.
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:04.980]  They've slowly but surely, since they've started,
[01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:07.220]  they've started expanding their range of stuff
[01:56:07.220 --> 01:56:08.620]  where they've got a couple of more options.
[01:56:08.620 --> 01:56:10.860]  So if you checked them out a while ago,
[01:56:10.860 --> 01:56:12.460]  it's worth looking at harrys.com
[01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:14.220]  and see some of the new products that they have
[01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:15.840]  that are relatively new.
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:20.660]  But the main thing is, their starter kit is just 15 bucks.
[01:56:20.660 --> 01:56:22.460]  That's a razor, three blades,
[01:56:22.460 --> 01:56:24.560]  and your choice of either their shave cream
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:26.200]  or the foaming shave gel.
[01:56:27.900 --> 01:56:30.040]  And when you buy new blades,
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:31.420]  this is where it really kicks in.
[01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:34.220]  It's about half the price of like the top stuff
[01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:36.300]  from Gillette or Schick or whatever.
[01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:39.100]  Just go to Amazon, go to Amazon and like price compare,
[01:56:39.100 --> 01:56:42.100]  like what a replacement set of five blades from Gillette
[01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:43.820]  costs compared to Harry's.
[01:56:43.820 --> 01:56:48.380]  And it's literally about, you know, give or take 50%.
[01:56:48.380 --> 01:56:50.800]  You know, it's a factor of two X.
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:54.180]  And you have the convenience where you just order online.
[01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:55.980]  You don't have to go into a store or anything like that.
[01:56:55.980 --> 01:56:59.180]  It just shows up at your house when you need them.
[01:56:59.180 --> 01:57:00.460]  Really can't say how nice it is.
[01:57:00.460 --> 01:57:02.660]  It's just a great experience, great product.
[01:57:02.660 --> 01:57:07.660]  And, you know, everybody has to shave something, so.
[01:57:08.180 --> 01:57:09.500]  Here's your motto for the year.
[01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:11.220]  Yeah, so where do you go to find out more?
[01:57:11.220 --> 01:57:15.920]  Go to harrys.com, H-A-R-R-Y-S dot com,
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:20.220]  and use the code talk show, know the, just talk show.
[01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:23.580]  And I forget what their deal is, but you'll save some bucks.
[01:57:23.580 --> 01:57:25.060]  Five bucks off your first order.
[01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:27.440]  That's it, five bucks off your first order.
[01:57:29.540 --> 01:57:31.700]  So my thanks to Harry's, great product.
[01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:33.820]  Talk show is the code, you'll save five bucks.
[01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:36.980]  So I guess, wait, you get the kit for just 10 bucks?
[01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:38.020]  I think so.
[01:57:38.020 --> 01:57:38.980]  That's crazy.
[01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:40.020]  It's a great product.
[01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:41.660]  You can't believe that you buy it.
[01:57:41.660 --> 01:57:45.180]  Even for 15 bucks, you just can't believe that it's 15 bucks.
[01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:46.780]  Great company.
[01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:51.620]  So the annual schedule, that's, ooh, shit.
[01:57:51.620 --> 01:57:52.540]  My desk is full.
[01:57:53.580 --> 01:57:57.560]  The, hold on a second, I gotta delete some podcasts here.
[01:57:57.560 --> 01:57:59.100]  That's fine.
[01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:02.860]  All right, I wanna talk about the annual schedule,
[01:58:02.860 --> 01:58:06.460]  which I think is for Yosemite and iOS,
[01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:08.020]  which they've stuck to for a couple of years,
[01:58:08.020 --> 01:58:11.340]  and as a source for this trend that we're seeing.
[01:58:11.340 --> 01:58:13.620]  And I think part of this, too, is sort of,
[01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:17.200]  from within Apple, is sort of a they can't win scenario,
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:20.620]  because in the early years of the iPhone,
[01:58:20.620 --> 01:58:24.500]  2007, 2008, the Mac, they admitted,
[01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:26.380]  they even had like a press release the one time,
[01:58:26.380 --> 01:58:27.500]  they had to publicly say,
[01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:30.580]  we pulled engineers from Mac OS X
[01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:33.500]  to help get the new iOS 2.0 out the door.
[01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:34.820]  Right, that was leopard, right?
[01:58:34.820 --> 01:58:38.820]  Yeah, so we're delaying the Mac OS till October.
[01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:41.380]  I think it was supposed to come out at WWDC in June,
[01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:43.420]  and now it's not coming out till October.
[01:58:44.900 --> 01:58:46.900]  Steve Jobs even had his name on it.
[01:58:46.900 --> 01:58:49.280]  You know that that hurt them
[01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:50.980]  to have to say something like that.
[01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:54.380]  Yeah, but nothing bad happened as a result of that.
[01:58:54.380 --> 01:58:58.940]  No, but I'm not even saying something bad happened for it.
[01:58:58.940 --> 01:59:01.940]  I'm just saying, no, that I feel like within Apple,
[01:59:01.940 --> 01:59:04.220]  they're like proud of the fact
[01:59:04.220 --> 01:59:07.280]  that they've gotten to the point where they can do,
[01:59:08.940 --> 01:59:12.180]  keep both OSes in states of constant development.
[01:59:12.180 --> 01:59:14.340]  You know, that they're- Well, can they?
[01:59:14.340 --> 01:59:18.940]  Well, I don't think either Yosemite or iOS 8
[01:59:18.940 --> 01:59:21.820]  is so bad that I wish I hadn't upgraded.
[01:59:21.820 --> 01:59:22.660]  No, they're not.
[01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:25.220]  And that's, see, that's the problem.
[01:59:25.220 --> 01:59:28.140]  Maybe this is part of the problem.
[01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:31.540]  They're not bad enough that alarm bells are going off.
[01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:32.380]  Right.
[01:59:32.380 --> 01:59:36.700]  But the rate of tiny paper cuts seems to be increasing.
[01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:37.860]  Yeah, and I don't know.
[01:59:37.860 --> 01:59:40.580]  Is it, if they're going to do that,
[01:59:40.580 --> 01:59:44.300]  is this the way it has to be?
[01:59:44.300 --> 01:59:47.220]  Is there no way to, either they slow down
[01:59:47.220 --> 01:59:48.920]  one or the other operating systems,
[01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:50.380]  or this is what we're gonna get?
[01:59:50.380 --> 01:59:51.820]  I don't know.
[01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:53.820]  Well, I don't think a slowing down
[01:59:53.820 --> 01:59:55.980]  would necessarily be that bad.
[01:59:55.980 --> 01:59:57.900]  I mean, you know, and right now,
[01:59:57.900 --> 02:00:01.460]  we're going through a few big transitions in the OSes,
[02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:02.360]  and we've been going through them
[02:00:02.360 --> 02:00:03.980]  over the last couple of releases,
[02:00:03.980 --> 02:00:07.200]  where, you know, iOS 7 was the massive redesign,
[02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:09.220]  in addition to a whole bunch of new frameworks
[02:00:09.220 --> 02:00:10.580]  under the hood.
[02:00:10.580 --> 02:00:13.140]  iOS 8 added the whole extension system,
[02:00:13.140 --> 02:00:15.660]  which is a pretty substantial thing.
[02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:18.540]  Well, and the whole idea of having these
[02:00:18.540 --> 02:00:22.780]  cross inner application, not just extensions in particular,
[02:00:22.780 --> 02:00:25.080]  extensions are like one version of it,
[02:00:25.080 --> 02:00:27.660]  but the way that so much of how we interact with the system
[02:00:27.660 --> 02:00:31.820]  is going through these, you know.
[02:00:31.820 --> 02:00:33.140]  Yeah, the XPC thing.
[02:00:33.140 --> 02:00:34.500]  Yeah, the XPC stuff.
[02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:37.420]  And so instead of having things that run in your app,
[02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:38.860]  and if they go bad, crash your app,
[02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:41.340]  they're outside your app in a sandbox.
[02:00:41.340 --> 02:00:45.340]  And it's not just one thing like sharing extensions,
[02:00:45.340 --> 02:00:46.420]  it's a whole bunch of things.
[02:00:46.420 --> 02:00:47.900]  It's a big transition.
[02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:50.880]  Right, and so they're going through transitions like that.
[02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:55.420]  So maybe the last few releases have just been
[02:00:55.420 --> 02:00:58.460]  bigger than the releases will usually be.
[02:00:58.460 --> 02:01:01.220]  You know, maybe this problem will settle down
[02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:02.640]  in the next couple of releases,
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:06.560]  just by nature of they're now on the other side
[02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:08.220]  of these giant transitions.
[02:01:08.220 --> 02:01:11.460]  But, and like, you know, when you call something
[02:01:11.460 --> 02:01:14.060]  a stable release, some part of it
[02:01:14.060 --> 02:01:15.220]  is just like a marketing value.
[02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:16.220]  Some part of it is like, you know,
[02:01:16.220 --> 02:01:18.500]  we're gonna declare this X.0,
[02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:20.740]  and that's just a number, it doesn't mean anything.
[02:01:21.700 --> 02:01:23.580]  But, and so you could always choose
[02:01:23.580 --> 02:01:25.780]  to just put less in each one,
[02:01:25.780 --> 02:01:28.260]  and still kind of have the best of both worlds.
[02:01:28.260 --> 02:01:30.540]  But some part of it also is like what Guy was saying,
[02:01:30.540 --> 02:01:33.940]  like the way, like the whole development pace
[02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:36.360]  of like how the year is spent,
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:38.780]  how the time between releases is spent
[02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:41.460]  between like, you know, launching, fixing the bugs,
[02:01:41.460 --> 02:01:43.020]  then, you know, kind of quiet period
[02:01:43.020 --> 02:01:44.300]  where you start developing the next stuff,
[02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:46.660]  and then, you know, beta for the next thing,
[02:01:46.660 --> 02:01:48.200]  and then launch the next thing.
[02:01:49.300 --> 02:01:50.580]  That will still be a problem.
[02:01:50.580 --> 02:01:53.140]  That will still be this compressed version,
[02:01:53.140 --> 02:01:55.620]  even if you just do less in each version.
[02:01:55.620 --> 02:01:57.620]  I still think it'll be better than what you have now
[02:01:57.620 --> 02:01:58.940]  of doing a lot in each version,
[02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:00.700]  and releasing them every year.
[02:02:00.700 --> 02:02:02.780]  I also, you know, it's important to point out
[02:02:02.780 --> 02:02:04.880]  for the marketing value of this,
[02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:07.140]  that this is a pretty young thing.
[02:02:07.140 --> 02:02:09.940]  It isn't young for iPhones, necessarily.
[02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:13.700]  You know, most iPhones have coincided
[02:02:13.700 --> 02:02:15.220]  with new iOS releases,
[02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:17.140]  or at least been fairly close to them.
[02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:20.940]  But they don't, first of all, they don't have to be.
[02:02:20.940 --> 02:02:22.100]  No, I think there's always been.
[02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:23.480]  I don't think there's ever been an iPhone
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:26.140]  that hasn't coincided with a new iOS.
[02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:26.980]  It's just that I think-
[02:02:26.980 --> 02:02:28.180]  I think you're right, I just couldn't think of,
[02:02:28.180 --> 02:02:29.580]  I couldn't think of the earlier ones.
[02:02:29.580 --> 02:02:30.980]  No, there's never been,
[02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:34.260]  and there'd never been one that can run the old OS.
[02:02:34.260 --> 02:02:37.340]  And some of them, like in the iOS 3, iOS 4 era,
[02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:41.060]  were not so heavily new features,
[02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:46.060]  and was a little bit more just expanding the foundation.
[02:02:46.740 --> 02:02:50.460]  But it was always a new.0 to coincide with the new phone.
[02:02:50.460 --> 02:02:53.420]  Right, but sometimes they haven't been that way.
[02:02:53.420 --> 02:02:56.660]  Like iPads, like famously the first iPad,
[02:02:56.660 --> 02:02:58.260]  shipped with iOS 3.2.
[02:02:58.260 --> 02:03:01.220]  It was a special build, a special track for the iPad
[02:03:01.220 --> 02:03:05.340]  that wasn't unified until iOS 4.2, I think, or 4.1.
[02:03:05.340 --> 02:03:08.620]  It was, even iOS 4, shipped first on the iPhone,
[02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:10.260]  didn't even run on the iPad.
[02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:12.240]  And then 4.1 and 4.2 unified them.
[02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:14.820]  So like, they have released hard,
[02:03:14.820 --> 02:03:17.860]  and so much of the recent high-profile hardware
[02:03:17.860 --> 02:03:19.780]  has launched with new OS versions,
[02:03:19.780 --> 02:03:21.500]  but not all of it has.
[02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:24.540]  And when it hasn't, nothing bad happened.
[02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:28.700]  Like there was no real downside to the iPad shipping
[02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:32.100]  with 3.2 instead of waiting for 4.0 to be ready
[02:03:32.100 --> 02:03:33.460]  to ship this hardware product.
[02:03:33.460 --> 02:03:36.980]  There was also no major downside to the iPad
[02:03:36.980 --> 02:03:39.940]  not even getting 4.0 because it wasn't ready yet.
[02:03:39.940 --> 02:03:42.540]  And like, you know, a few people complained,
[02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:44.220]  but it wasn't a huge deal.
[02:03:44.220 --> 02:03:46.320]  It didn't hurt the sales of the iPad, really.
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:48.520]  It didn't hurt the iPhone, it didn't hurt iOS 4.
[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:50.980]  Like, it just didn't, it wasn't a big deal.
[02:03:50.980 --> 02:03:53.140]  Right, famously the iPad in particular
[02:03:53.140 --> 02:03:55.540]  had more explosive sales in those early years
[02:03:55.540 --> 02:03:56.380]  than it has now.
[02:03:56.380 --> 02:03:57.740]  Now they've, you know, flattened off.
[02:03:57.740 --> 02:03:59.640]  Right, exactly, and there's probably further reasons,
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:00.740]  but still. Right.
[02:04:00.740 --> 02:04:03.820]  So, and you know, Macs are released all the time.
[02:04:03.820 --> 02:04:08.820]  And if a new version of Mac OS X is going to be due soon,
[02:04:08.820 --> 02:04:11.420]  they'll usually hold it.
[02:04:11.420 --> 02:04:13.740]  Same, like they did with the Retina iMac,
[02:04:13.740 --> 02:04:15.780]  they'll usually hold it for that same event
[02:04:15.780 --> 02:04:17.100]  and then they'll ship together.
[02:04:17.100 --> 02:04:20.340]  But, you know, a Mac could be released next month
[02:04:20.340 --> 02:04:22.900]  and it'll run the OS that's from four months ago
[02:04:22.900 --> 02:04:25.240]  or five months ago, whatever, and doesn't matter.
[02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:26.660]  Nothing bad happens.
[02:04:26.660 --> 02:04:28.420]  You know, no one says, oh, Apple should have released
[02:04:28.420 --> 02:04:29.760]  a new OS with these new MacBook Airs.
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:31.240]  Like, nope, doesn't matter at all.
[02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:32.540]  Doesn't even come up.
[02:04:32.540 --> 02:04:36.260]  So I question, like, the value of having this,
[02:04:36.260 --> 02:04:40.020]  this like lockstep of major OSs tied
[02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:41.660]  to major hardware releases,
[02:04:41.660 --> 02:04:43.480]  I think is mostly self-imposed.
[02:04:43.480 --> 02:04:44.380]  I think they do it that way
[02:04:44.380 --> 02:04:46.100]  because they like to do it that way
[02:04:46.100 --> 02:04:47.520]  or they think they should do it that way.
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:50.460]  But when it hasn't gone that way,
[02:04:50.460 --> 02:04:52.360]  I think the market has spoken loud and clear
[02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:54.180]  that it doesn't really matter.
[02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:55.620]  Yeah, I kind of agree with that.
[02:04:55.620 --> 02:04:58.460]  I do, you know, and I don't think that it's as superficial
[02:04:58.460 --> 02:05:01.860]  as that they want to do it so that they have more to show
[02:05:01.860 --> 02:05:03.540]  in a keynote.
[02:05:03.540 --> 02:05:06.820]  But, you know, I think there's something loosely
[02:05:06.820 --> 02:05:09.460]  along those lines, though, where they, you know,
[02:05:09.460 --> 02:05:14.240]  it's easier to market when there's more new features.
[02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:17.460]  Right, and that's what I mean when I say
[02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:21.460]  that marketing is becoming too high of a priority.
[02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:24.580]  It's not that, like, and one of the things that bother me,
[02:05:24.580 --> 02:05:27.260]  like, I never said the marketing department
[02:05:27.260 --> 02:05:30.220]  because what I didn't want to say is, like,
[02:05:30.220 --> 02:05:32.660]  Phil Schiller is personally controlling Apple
[02:05:32.660 --> 02:05:34.660]  and killing Craig Federighi's goals,
[02:05:34.660 --> 02:05:36.580]  because that's not what I meant.
[02:05:36.580 --> 02:05:40.780]  I mean, the idea of marketing, the marketing benefits
[02:05:40.780 --> 02:05:43.460]  of this annual schedule and of lock-stepping them
[02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:46.760]  with the hardware, that is too high of a priority.
[02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:49.440]  That is taking priority seemingly over software quality,
[02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:51.600]  and that is what I have a problem with.
[02:05:51.600 --> 02:05:55.020]  And that is not a departmental thing, as far as I know.
[02:05:55.020 --> 02:05:57.140]  You know, I don't think, you know,
[02:05:57.140 --> 02:05:59.100]  Phil Schiller is personally taking over the company
[02:05:59.100 --> 02:06:00.100]  and having these battles everywhere.
[02:06:00.100 --> 02:06:01.940]  I seriously doubt that.
[02:06:01.940 --> 02:06:05.820]  I think it's, like, the company has decided as a whole
[02:06:05.820 --> 02:06:09.460]  at the high level, like, this schedule is right
[02:06:09.460 --> 02:06:11.300]  for the company, this is what we're going to do.
[02:06:11.300 --> 02:06:13.580]  We're going to have these annual releases,
[02:06:13.580 --> 02:06:16.260]  we're going to, you know, tie these things, lock-step,
[02:06:16.260 --> 02:06:18.420]  so that hardware releases with software.
[02:06:18.420 --> 02:06:19.820]  Yeah, and I've always said, you know,
[02:06:19.820 --> 02:06:22.380]  I think your point is well put,
[02:06:22.380 --> 02:06:26.980]  and I've always said that marketing at Apple
[02:06:26.980 --> 02:06:29.200]  doesn't work like it does at a lot of other companies.
[02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:30.880]  I don't know about most other companies, I don't know,
[02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:33.060]  but, like, I think the traditional way
[02:06:33.060 --> 02:06:35.660]  where marketing is, like, icing on the cake,
[02:06:35.660 --> 02:06:37.620]  and it's, like, products go through development,
[02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:39.180]  and when they're done being developed,
[02:06:39.180 --> 02:06:40.580]  they hand them over to marketing,
[02:06:40.580 --> 02:06:44.260]  and marketing figures out a box and a tagline
[02:06:44.260 --> 02:06:45.620]  and finishes it.
[02:06:45.620 --> 02:06:47.580]  You know, it's better, I've always said,
[02:06:47.580 --> 02:06:50.260]  like, one way to think of it is it'd be better to,
[02:06:50.260 --> 02:06:53.300]  you'd better understand Phil Schiller's responsibilities
[02:06:53.300 --> 02:06:55.540]  if you took the word marketing out of his title
[02:06:55.540 --> 02:06:59.240]  and just thought of him as senior vice president of product.
[02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:00.140]  Exactly.
[02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:03.100]  It's inextricably tied, you know,
[02:07:03.100 --> 02:07:05.780]  the advertising of the products,
[02:07:05.780 --> 02:07:08.860]  the marketing of the products is inextricably tied
[02:07:08.860 --> 02:07:13.860]  to the development of the products from the get-go.
[02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:16.140]  It's one and the same.
[02:07:16.140 --> 02:07:18.740]  Right, like, they're not gonna make a product
[02:07:18.740 --> 02:07:20.380]  that there's no clear market for
[02:07:20.380 --> 02:07:22.980]  or that doesn't fit into their marketing message as a whole.
[02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:25.220]  Right, and that makes their marketing,
[02:07:26.140 --> 02:07:28.820]  I think, refreshingly honest,
[02:07:28.820 --> 02:07:30.740]  that what they are bragging about
[02:07:30.740 --> 02:07:33.140]  about their products is usually true.
[02:07:33.140 --> 02:07:35.260]  I mean, most of their marketing is like,
[02:07:35.260 --> 02:07:38.420]  here is what our product is, period.
[02:07:38.420 --> 02:07:40.860]  They don't need to do that much more than that.
[02:07:40.860 --> 02:07:42.820]  Like, when the MacBook Air first came out
[02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:45.500]  and they had the ad where it came out of an envelope
[02:07:45.500 --> 02:07:47.340]  and they were like, look at this laptop,
[02:07:47.340 --> 02:07:49.420]  it's crazy thin and crazy light.
[02:07:49.420 --> 02:07:51.740]  Well, that's exactly what it was, you know?
[02:07:51.740 --> 02:07:54.540]  There was no spin on it, no lie, you know?
[02:07:54.540 --> 02:07:58.980]  So, yeah, which we'll get to in a few minutes, I bet.
[02:07:58.980 --> 02:08:03.980]  But, yeah, so, I mean, I think the annual review cycle,
[02:08:04.940 --> 02:08:07.620]  I think, is a major part of the quality problems.
[02:08:07.620 --> 02:08:11.140]  The quality decline did, I think, precede it,
[02:08:11.140 --> 02:08:12.880]  because the annual review cycle is pretty young.
[02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:14.900]  I mean, where did they start that, with Lion?
[02:08:16.140 --> 02:08:17.100]  Or when they went, I think,
[02:08:17.100 --> 02:08:18.580]  when they went from Lion to Mountain Lion.
[02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:21.140]  I think that was the first one-year interval, wasn't it?
[02:08:21.140 --> 02:08:24.660]  Yeah, it was a little bit more than a year, it was...
[02:08:26.580 --> 02:08:28.080]  I'm looking at the Wikipedia page now.
[02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:33.080]  Mac OS X 10.7 Lion shipped in October 2010,
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:39.000]  and Mountain Lion was announced February 2012.
[02:08:39.140 --> 02:08:41.100]  That was, February 2012, that was the one
[02:08:41.100 --> 02:08:43.420]  where they had the private briefings,
[02:08:43.420 --> 02:08:44.780]  like, where I'm, was it Schiller?
[02:08:44.780 --> 02:08:46.180]  Right, is that the one where Schiller told you,
[02:08:46.180 --> 02:08:47.940]  we're gonna do things differently now, or whatever?
[02:08:47.940 --> 02:08:48.860]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:08:48.860 --> 02:08:50.620]  Yeah, I think that was when this started,
[02:08:50.620 --> 02:08:52.580]  was roughly then, you know?
[02:08:52.580 --> 02:08:53.460]  I think that's what they meant.
[02:08:53.460 --> 02:08:55.300]  They're doing things differently, you know, in a few ways.
[02:08:55.300 --> 02:08:57.140]  But, so, you know, that, I think is-
[02:08:57.140 --> 02:08:58.980]  Yeah, and I should say, yeah,
[02:08:58.980 --> 02:09:02.260]  maybe I overemphasized the cyclical nature of Apple.
[02:09:02.260 --> 02:09:03.980]  We've really only had two releases
[02:09:03.980 --> 02:09:07.360]  that follow the current cycle of a June announcement
[02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:09.260]  and an October debut.
[02:09:09.260 --> 02:09:10.940]  Right, iOS has been more consistent,
[02:09:10.940 --> 02:09:13.100]  because the phone schedule has been pretty much the same.
[02:09:13.100 --> 02:09:14.820]  I mean, you know, it shifted from June to September,
[02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:16.500]  or whatever, but otherwise it's been pretty much the same.
[02:09:16.500 --> 02:09:18.260]  Yeah, beginning of summer to end of summer.
[02:09:18.260 --> 02:09:19.860]  Right, exactly, but yeah.
[02:09:19.860 --> 02:09:22.620]  Overall, you know, iPhone has been consistent.
[02:09:22.620 --> 02:09:26.100]  It's only really Mac that has become inconsistent recently,
[02:09:26.100 --> 02:09:28.420]  or that is now consistent, rather.
[02:09:28.420 --> 02:09:31.100]  Yeah, and it used to be annual in the early years,
[02:09:31.100 --> 02:09:34.540]  because it was so bad and needed so much improvement.
[02:09:34.540 --> 02:09:36.140]  Well, it was young, you know?
[02:09:36.140 --> 02:09:39.980]  Like, now, like, I don't see, as a Mac user,
[02:09:39.980 --> 02:09:42.420]  I don't really see a lot of value
[02:09:42.420 --> 02:09:47.420]  in revving the main OS I use for all of my work frequently.
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:49.340]  Like, I don't see the point.
[02:09:49.340 --> 02:09:51.900]  Like, the only reason I got Yosemite when I did
[02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:54.160]  was because I bought a new computer that came with it.
[02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:56.720]  I would have waited, probably, until, like, a point two,
[02:09:56.720 --> 02:09:58.620]  most likely, before I installed it.
[02:09:58.620 --> 02:10:00.100]  I never installed it on my old computer.
[02:10:00.100 --> 02:10:03.060]  I only got it because the new computer came with it
[02:10:03.060 --> 02:10:05.060]  and can't be downgraded.
[02:10:05.060 --> 02:10:08.420]  And because, like, I'm very risk averse
[02:10:08.420 --> 02:10:09.560]  with my work computer.
[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:10.400]  Right, yeah.
[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:11.780]  Like, if I'm in the middle of a project,
[02:10:11.780 --> 02:10:15.220]  which I almost always am, I will put off any updates.
[02:10:15.220 --> 02:10:18.740]  Even, like, an X.2 or X.3, like,
[02:10:18.740 --> 02:10:20.700]  I'll put that off until I'm, like,
[02:10:20.700 --> 02:10:21.940]  done editing the podcast for the week,
[02:10:21.940 --> 02:10:23.320]  just in case something bad happens,
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:24.340]  you know, something like that.
[02:10:24.340 --> 02:10:26.740]  Yeah, my way has always been to have a computer at my desk
[02:10:26.740 --> 02:10:30.180]  that's my, quote, main computer, that's the iMac 5K.
[02:10:30.180 --> 02:10:32.540]  I'll keep that at a conservative pace
[02:10:32.540 --> 02:10:36.100]  and then have a laptop that I don't really give
[02:10:36.100 --> 02:10:38.420]  two craps about if it, not that I don't care about it,
[02:10:38.420 --> 02:10:40.420]  but that I don't care if it gets buggy.
[02:10:40.420 --> 02:10:41.260]  Right, yeah.
[02:10:41.260 --> 02:10:42.860]  That I'll install developer betas on.
[02:10:42.860 --> 02:10:45.020]  Yeah, my laptop actually runs the, like,
[02:10:45.020 --> 02:10:48.000]  it's on the Yosemite beta chain, like, through the app store.
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:48.840]  Yeah, so am I.
[02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:50.900]  It's currently on 10.10.2 or whatever it is.
[02:10:50.900 --> 02:10:52.820]  Yeah, and I regret it terribly.
[02:10:52.820 --> 02:10:53.860]  Mine actually, that actually, I mean,
[02:10:53.860 --> 02:10:54.700]  I hardly use that computer,
[02:10:54.700 --> 02:10:56.460]  but that's actually not been a problem for me.
[02:10:56.460 --> 02:10:57.980]  Yeah, well, there's one particular bug
[02:10:57.980 --> 02:10:59.740]  that really, it's driving me nuts.
[02:10:59.740 --> 02:11:01.740]  The dictionary, and I don't even know how universal is,
[02:11:01.740 --> 02:11:03.220]  but for me at least, you know,
[02:11:03.220 --> 02:11:05.980]  the dictionary lookup feature where you can do,
[02:11:05.980 --> 02:11:07.100]  I've changed my shortcut.
[02:11:07.100 --> 02:11:09.820]  I think the standard one might be Control-Command-D.
[02:11:09.820 --> 02:11:10.980]  Oh, I always forget that.
[02:11:10.980 --> 02:11:12.060]  I still launch the dictionary app
[02:11:12.060 --> 02:11:14.020]  from Spotlight every time or from Launch Bar.
[02:11:14.020 --> 02:11:15.160]  You know, this is a cool shortcut.
[02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:18.460]  You can triple tap on the trackpad over a word,
[02:11:18.460 --> 02:11:20.020]  not click, tap.
[02:11:20.020 --> 02:11:20.860]  Right, right.
[02:11:20.860 --> 02:11:23.620]  Triple tap, and you get an inline dictionary lookup
[02:11:23.620 --> 02:11:25.180]  of whatever word you want.
[02:11:25.180 --> 02:11:26.020]  You use it all the time.
[02:11:26.020 --> 02:11:26.840]  That's crazy.
[02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:28.500]  It crashes Mars Edit.
[02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:31.380]  It doesn't crash BB Edit, but in BB Edit,
[02:11:31.380 --> 02:11:34.860]  it leaves the yellow highlighted thing
[02:11:34.860 --> 02:11:36.860]  of the word on screen.
[02:11:36.860 --> 02:11:37.700]  Oh, that's weird.
[02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:39.500]  It's something changed between 10.1 and 10.2
[02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:41.620]  with third-party apps in the dictionary lookup,
[02:11:41.620 --> 02:11:43.140]  and I do it all the time,
[02:11:43.140 --> 02:11:45.020]  and I know it's gonna crash,
[02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:45.980]  but I don't think about it.
[02:11:45.980 --> 02:11:46.820]  I think I gotta look.
[02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:47.660]  Did I spell this right?
[02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:50.060]  Triple tap, boom.
[02:11:50.060 --> 02:11:52.880]  Now, all the apps I use are like Mars Edit and BB Edit.
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:55.060]  They all auto-save everything, so I don't lose data,
[02:11:55.060 --> 02:11:58.060]  but it's still an annoyance.
[02:11:58.060 --> 02:11:59.780]  Yeah, and this is the problem.
[02:11:59.780 --> 02:12:01.340]  There's so many little things like that.
[02:12:01.340 --> 02:12:03.460]  But it's a beta, so I'm not complaining about it.
[02:12:03.460 --> 02:12:04.300]  Yeah, obviously.
[02:12:04.300 --> 02:12:06.900]  Here's the historical schedule for Mac OS X.
[02:12:06.900 --> 02:12:10.540]  So 10.0 came out in early 2001.
[02:12:10.540 --> 02:12:11.620]  And that barely even counts.
[02:12:11.620 --> 02:12:12.980]  It was a heap and pile of shit,
[02:12:12.980 --> 02:12:17.980]  and then 10.1 came out in July later the same year.
[02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:21.660]  Just from March to July,
[02:12:21.660 --> 02:12:24.540]  they came out with a major version of Mac OS X.
[02:12:26.420 --> 02:12:28.900]  10.2 was May 2002.
[02:12:28.900 --> 02:12:31.320]  10.3 was June 2003.
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:33.180]  These are announcement dates, not release dates.
[02:12:33.180 --> 02:12:35.720]  I guess I should do release dates.
[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:39.780]  Then we waited almost two years for 10.4 Tiger,
[02:12:39.780 --> 02:12:42.020]  which is really where I feel like they tied it off
[02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:43.660]  and were like, okay, we're done
[02:12:43.660 --> 02:12:46.540]  with the early years of Mac OS X.
[02:12:46.540 --> 02:12:49.220]  Yeah, I came in with 10.3.
[02:12:49.220 --> 02:12:51.800]  Tiger went all the way to 10.4.11,
[02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:54.380]  which I think is the highest they ever got.
[02:12:54.380 --> 02:12:55.620]  Yeah, it's the highest they ever got.
[02:12:55.620 --> 02:12:57.340]  10.6 didn't get that high?
[02:12:57.340 --> 02:13:00.060]  No, 10.6 only went to 10.6.8.
[02:13:00.060 --> 02:13:04.560]  But Wikipedia lists a 10.6.8 v1.1,
[02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:06.220]  which is some kind of weird patch.
[02:13:07.940 --> 02:13:10.360]  But that's where they switched to two years.
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:15.360]  And in fact, 10.5 didn't come out until October 26, 2007.
[02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:16.560]  That's the one where they-
[02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:17.400]  That was the delayed one.
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:20.720]  The delayed one, so it was about two and a half years.
[02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:23.580]  And that was a really stable time, by the way.
[02:13:23.580 --> 02:13:26.580]  This, I think, is the high-water mark that...
[02:13:26.580 --> 02:13:29.680]  And again, as Jalkut had a web blog post
[02:13:29.680 --> 02:13:31.020]  in response to your thing,
[02:13:31.020 --> 02:13:35.500]  you know, don't use too much...
[02:13:35.500 --> 02:13:36.340]  Rose-colored glasses.
[02:13:36.340 --> 02:13:37.980]  Yeah, rose-colored glasses, exactly.
[02:13:37.980 --> 02:13:39.360]  Don't have too strong a prescription
[02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:40.740]  in your rose-colored glasses.
[02:13:40.740 --> 02:13:41.580]  Right.
[02:13:41.580 --> 02:13:44.420]  Like all the people who allegedly like web OS?
[02:13:44.420 --> 02:13:47.420]  But, you know, I do think there's something to,
[02:13:47.420 --> 02:13:50.140]  you know, it being a high-water mark, this era,
[02:13:50.140 --> 02:13:52.820]  a high-water mark for stability system-wide.
[02:13:54.180 --> 02:13:57.500]  Yeah, I mean, and everybody glorifies 10.6 also,
[02:13:57.500 --> 02:13:59.460]  because that was the famous one that they said,
[02:13:59.460 --> 02:14:00.820]  no new features, we're just gonna, like, you know,
[02:14:00.820 --> 02:14:02.900]  work on the under-the-hood stuff.
[02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:03.740]  Right.
[02:14:03.740 --> 02:14:04.580]  And it was successful.
[02:14:04.580 --> 02:14:05.660]  It was...
[02:14:05.660 --> 02:14:07.260]  That brought in tons of modern stuff.
[02:14:07.260 --> 02:14:08.500]  That brought in Grand Central Dispatch,
[02:14:08.500 --> 02:14:09.340]  among other things.
[02:14:09.340 --> 02:14:10.260]  It included though,
[02:14:10.260 --> 02:14:12.300]  included in the fact that it had no new features,
[02:14:12.300 --> 02:14:15.880]  is it was two years after 10.5 Leopard came out.
[02:14:15.880 --> 02:14:19.460]  So it was two years since the release.
[02:14:19.460 --> 02:14:22.180]  It was, this is, you know, it was released in 2009.
[02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:25.080]  This is interesting.
[02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:27.420]  It was announced in June 2008,
[02:14:27.420 --> 02:14:29.820]  but didn't get released until August 2009.
[02:14:29.820 --> 02:14:31.180]  I don't remember that.
[02:14:31.180 --> 02:14:32.980]  Do you remember it being a year in beta?
[02:14:32.980 --> 02:14:34.500]  No, but it doesn't matter.
[02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:35.340]  Well, I don't know.
[02:14:35.340 --> 02:14:37.020]  If it's on Wikipedia, it's gotta be true.
[02:14:37.020 --> 02:14:38.600]  Of course.
[02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:42.220]  But it was two years, and it had no new features,
[02:14:42.220 --> 02:14:44.820]  and it was two years until we got Lion.
[02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:46.420]  So there was, like, this four-year period.
[02:14:46.420 --> 02:14:48.340]  And again, no new features is kind of bullshit.
[02:14:48.340 --> 02:14:50.980]  I mean, like, adding Grand Central Dispatch.
[02:14:50.980 --> 02:14:51.820]  It's not a feature,
[02:14:51.820 --> 02:14:52.820]  because it's not, like, a thing
[02:14:52.820 --> 02:14:54.020]  that they can put in a commercial,
[02:14:54.020 --> 02:14:57.100]  but it's clearly, you know, a huge feature.
[02:14:57.100 --> 02:14:59.720]  It's just a behind-the-scenes developer feature.
[02:15:00.700 --> 02:15:02.480]  But that's, like, a four-year period
[02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:03.900]  where they didn't really have
[02:15:03.900 --> 02:15:07.400]  a lot of user-facing features added,
[02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:09.900]  and is widely viewed, and I think accurately so,
[02:15:09.900 --> 02:15:12.420]  is sort of the high-water mark of stability.
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:15.160]  Yeah, and, you know,
[02:15:15.160 --> 02:15:16.740]  part of that could be rose-colored glasses,
[02:15:16.740 --> 02:15:19.140]  but I think there is a lot of truth to that.
[02:15:19.140 --> 02:15:21.780]  Yeah, we might see something like that soon, though.
[02:15:21.780 --> 02:15:24.660]  Like you said, they're going through transitions now,
[02:15:24.660 --> 02:15:27.500]  and it's, you know, iCloud is certainly one of them.
[02:15:27.500 --> 02:15:29.520]  I think the other transition they're going through
[02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:34.520]  is this general idea of iOS and Mac being siblings.
[02:15:35.300 --> 02:15:36.140]  Right.
[02:15:36.140 --> 02:15:39.340]  Like, you know, tied together.
[02:15:39.340 --> 02:15:40.320]  The best example of that,
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:42.660]  best example has gotta be the iWork,
[02:15:42.660 --> 02:15:44.360]  the new versions of all the iWork apps,
[02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:45.520]  where now they're saying
[02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:48.700]  these are the exact same file formats between the two,
[02:15:48.700 --> 02:15:50.580]  even if that means that the Mac version
[02:15:50.580 --> 02:15:52.980]  is gonna lose a bunch of cool features.
[02:15:52.980 --> 02:15:55.160]  You know, and eventually, presumably,
[02:15:55.160 --> 02:15:57.440]  they're gonna get those features back,
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:15:59.620]  but then we'll have them on both platforms.
[02:15:59.620 --> 02:16:03.820]  We'll have, you know, nice kerning for fonts on iOS
[02:16:03.820 --> 02:16:06.580]  in addition to Mac.
[02:16:06.580 --> 02:16:07.620]  And that's a perfect example.
[02:16:07.620 --> 02:16:10.500]  But they're doing that in little ways in a bunch of apps.
[02:16:11.500 --> 02:16:13.900]  Right, and a lot of the underlying frameworks
[02:16:13.900 --> 02:16:14.860]  are also being unified.
[02:16:14.860 --> 02:16:17.360]  A lot of the underlying API stuff, the SDKs,
[02:16:17.360 --> 02:16:19.940]  a lot of that has been unified in the last couple releases.
[02:16:19.940 --> 02:16:23.660]  They've both gone through the major visual redesigns,
[02:16:23.660 --> 02:16:25.540]  more so on iOS, but still, you know,
[02:16:25.540 --> 02:16:27.340]  you have somebody who's no slouch in that department.
[02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:30.300]  So like, they have gone through a lot
[02:16:30.300 --> 02:16:31.540]  in the last couple years.
[02:16:31.540 --> 02:16:33.100]  And I don't expect either of those things
[02:16:33.100 --> 02:16:34.740]  to happen again anytime soon either.
[02:16:34.740 --> 02:16:36.540]  I think we're at least five, six, seven years
[02:16:36.540 --> 02:16:39.700]  from either OS getting a major visual refresh.
[02:16:39.700 --> 02:16:40.540]  Right.
[02:16:40.540 --> 02:16:42.740]  Other, you know, just an annual tightening up.
[02:16:42.740 --> 02:16:45.500]  Yeah, Swift gives me a little bit of pause
[02:16:45.500 --> 02:16:47.900]  because, you know, right now, like,
[02:16:47.900 --> 02:16:49.580]  Swift was announced,
[02:16:49.580 --> 02:16:53.140]  nothing written inside of Apple was using Swift yet.
[02:16:53.140 --> 02:16:55.340]  And none of the frameworks use Swift natively.
[02:16:55.340 --> 02:16:56.900]  None of them are written in Swift natively,
[02:16:56.900 --> 02:16:58.540]  at least not as of last year.
[02:16:59.740 --> 02:17:02.200]  So, you know, introducing a whole new programming language
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:05.100]  that certainly begs for a lot of things
[02:17:05.100 --> 02:17:06.400]  to be rewritten in it.
[02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:11.220]  That might be a major thing that is potentially a burden
[02:17:11.220 --> 02:17:13.260]  or a distraction on the engineering teams.
[02:17:13.260 --> 02:17:15.620]  I also question whether that is what they should be doing
[02:17:15.620 --> 02:17:16.460]  with their time.
[02:17:16.460 --> 02:17:19.660]  But in general, though,
[02:17:19.660 --> 02:17:23.860]  I think the next couple releases have very good reason
[02:17:23.860 --> 02:17:27.900]  to be less ambitious and more stable.
[02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:29.660]  Yeah, I hope so.
[02:17:30.820 --> 02:17:33.820]  Before we move on and talk about that MacBook thing,
[02:17:33.820 --> 02:17:37.200]  the other thought I had is that a lot of the complaints
[02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:41.020]  that I've seen with regard to these little nagging,
[02:17:41.020 --> 02:17:43.260]  it's supposed to just work, but it doesn't just work.
[02:17:43.260 --> 02:17:47.580]  A lot of it has to do with wireless networking
[02:17:47.580 --> 02:17:50.960]  and stuff that's supposed to happen between two devices.
[02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:53.700]  Like for me in particular, AirDrop is amazing.
[02:17:53.700 --> 02:17:55.540]  AirDrop works absolutely great.
[02:17:55.540 --> 02:17:59.100]  And I use it all the time, like where I'm on the phone
[02:17:59.100 --> 02:18:00.420]  and I have, ooh, I want to link to this
[02:18:00.420 --> 02:18:01.540]  from Daring Fireball.
[02:18:01.540 --> 02:18:02.880]  And instead of doing what I used to do,
[02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:04.840]  I'd like send it to Pinboard or something
[02:18:04.840 --> 02:18:06.100]  and then go to my Mac and get it.
[02:18:06.100 --> 02:18:08.840]  I just AirDrop it to my Mac as soon as my Mac wakes up
[02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:13.340]  and it, boom, it's there and there's nothing to clean up.
[02:18:13.340 --> 02:18:16.400]  I don't have to erase or let language forever
[02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:19.020]  an old Pinboard bookmark that I really just wanted
[02:18:19.020 --> 02:18:20.960]  to shuffle between the two.
[02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:23.560]  It's great, but I've heard from people
[02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:25.400]  who say AirDrop never works for them.
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:29.140]  But anyway, what gives me pause is that a lot of these things
[02:18:29.140 --> 02:18:31.060]  are these little nagging two things
[02:18:31.060 --> 02:18:32.780]  that are supposed to talk to each other
[02:18:32.780 --> 02:18:34.560]  over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi or whatever
[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:38.040]  don't really quite work the way they're supposed to
[02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:42.180]  is that is the entire description of Apple Watch, right?
[02:18:42.180 --> 02:18:46.560]  It's like the sort of things that don't just work
[02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:49.100]  are the only things Apple Watch exists for.
[02:18:49.100 --> 02:18:51.180]  There's nothing else, other than telling time,
[02:18:51.180 --> 02:18:52.460]  there's nothing else the thing does
[02:18:52.460 --> 02:18:57.140]  other than these little wireless interactions
[02:18:57.140 --> 02:19:01.460]  sort of dancing all day long with other devices.
[02:19:01.460 --> 02:19:02.820]  I even thought earlier,
[02:19:03.860 --> 02:19:07.580]  you can't even sync Apple Watch with a cable.
[02:19:07.580 --> 02:19:08.420]  No.
[02:19:08.420 --> 02:19:09.700]  There's no ports on it.
[02:19:09.700 --> 02:19:11.300]  It can only charge.
[02:19:11.300 --> 02:19:13.200]  Everything else is wireless.
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:15.660]  So this stuff has to be solved.
[02:19:15.660 --> 02:19:19.860]  One thing, though, the Apple Watch, it can go either way.
[02:19:19.860 --> 02:19:21.700]  I think you can look at it from one side
[02:19:21.700 --> 02:19:23.340]  and you can say, well, this is gonna be
[02:19:23.340 --> 02:19:26.260]  a brand new 1.0 of everything
[02:19:26.260 --> 02:19:29.580]  and it's gonna be potentially a huge drain
[02:19:29.580 --> 02:19:32.820]  on engineering resources at Apple and focus from Apple,
[02:19:32.820 --> 02:19:34.660]  which could bode very poorly
[02:19:34.660 --> 02:19:36.460]  for their quality going forward.
[02:19:36.460 --> 02:19:39.900]  Or you can look at it as maybe the Apple Watch
[02:19:39.900 --> 02:19:42.380]  will take some of the marketing burden for a while
[02:19:42.380 --> 02:19:47.380]  and let them be a little more boring with iOS and OS X.
[02:19:47.400 --> 02:19:49.740]  And pour enormous resources into things
[02:19:49.740 --> 02:19:54.500]  like getting the Bluetooth stack in really tip-top shape.
[02:19:54.500 --> 02:19:58.300]  Right, so I think this is a wild card.
[02:19:58.300 --> 02:20:02.260]  I think the Watch, I don't, I mean,
[02:20:02.260 --> 02:20:04.400]  again, I could be wrong.
[02:20:04.400 --> 02:20:06.460]  I don't think the Watch is gonna require
[02:20:06.460 --> 02:20:09.460]  a massive amount of engineering, of software engineering.
[02:20:09.460 --> 02:20:10.940]  It simply can't do that much yet.
[02:20:10.940 --> 02:20:12.500]  The hardware is very simple.
[02:20:13.940 --> 02:20:17.120]  Relative to all the things iOS does, for instance,
[02:20:17.120 --> 02:20:18.960]  all the things Mac OS X does,
[02:20:18.960 --> 02:20:20.400]  I don't think it's gonna require
[02:20:20.400 --> 02:20:22.460]  massive engineering resources
[02:20:22.460 --> 02:20:25.940]  to get it through its first couple of years.
[02:20:25.940 --> 02:20:28.780]  Again, that could be totally wrong, I don't know.
[02:20:28.780 --> 02:20:30.160]  But just as a relative thing,
[02:20:30.160 --> 02:20:32.420]  I think it's probably a much smaller project.
[02:20:34.100 --> 02:20:36.620]  And I also don't know how well it's going to sell.
[02:20:36.620 --> 02:20:41.420]  It could end up being just like new iPods, basically.
[02:20:41.420 --> 02:20:42.900]  It could just be like,
[02:20:42.900 --> 02:20:44.560]  it could disappoint a lot of analysts,
[02:20:44.560 --> 02:20:45.660]  it could disappoint Apple,
[02:20:45.660 --> 02:20:49.180]  it could sell a few million here or there,
[02:20:49.180 --> 02:20:51.020]  but not set the world on fire
[02:20:51.020 --> 02:20:53.540]  and not be ubiquitous among Apple people.
[02:20:53.540 --> 02:20:54.780]  Or it could set the world on fire
[02:20:54.780 --> 02:20:56.460]  and it could sell tremendously, and it could,
[02:20:56.460 --> 02:20:58.220]  like, we have no idea how it's gonna sell yet.
[02:20:58.220 --> 02:21:00.620]  And I think that might determine
[02:21:00.620 --> 02:21:03.660]  some of the company's future priorities and direction.
[02:21:03.660 --> 02:21:05.000]  I think the single,
[02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:06.980]  I think if it works as advertised,
[02:21:06.980 --> 02:21:08.100]  it's gonna sell very well.
[02:21:08.100 --> 02:21:10.460]  And I think the single thing that could sink it
[02:21:10.460 --> 02:21:14.220]  would be if it comes out in the next month or two,
[02:21:14.220 --> 02:21:16.340]  two months, whenever it's supposed to come out.
[02:21:16.340 --> 02:21:20.300]  And there's a bunch of little nagging bugs
[02:21:20.300 --> 02:21:22.860]  with the interactivity with your iPhone.
[02:21:22.860 --> 02:21:24.760]  And, you know, your text messages
[02:21:24.760 --> 02:21:27.580]  are supposed to be showing up on your wrist and they don't.
[02:21:27.580 --> 02:21:30.580]  Or it's not supposed to drain your battery.
[02:21:30.580 --> 02:21:32.820]  But when you sink, you know, when you have an iPad,
[02:21:32.820 --> 02:21:34.980]  you know, you put your Apple Watch on
[02:21:34.980 --> 02:21:36.780]  and your phone, which used to typically
[02:21:36.780 --> 02:21:40.240]  get you through the whole day, is in the red by noon,
[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:41.940]  that's gonna, that would be a huge problem
[02:21:41.940 --> 02:21:45.220]  because it's not that they can't fix those bugs,
[02:21:45.220 --> 02:21:48.540]  it's that the perception will hit while it's young
[02:21:48.540 --> 02:21:50.460]  that the thing doesn't work like it's supposed to.
[02:21:50.460 --> 02:21:53.180]  And that sort of thing is very, very hard to shake.
[02:21:53.180 --> 02:21:55.260]  Oh yeah, I mean, like if it becomes
[02:21:55.260 --> 02:21:57.460]  part of people's tech superstitions to like,
[02:21:57.460 --> 02:21:59.620]  oh, you better like only turn on Bluetooth
[02:21:59.620 --> 02:22:00.460]  when you're doing something with the watch
[02:22:00.460 --> 02:22:02.220]  and turn Bluetooth off on your phone to save your battery.
[02:22:02.220 --> 02:22:04.220]  Like if that kind of stuff starts getting into
[02:22:04.220 --> 02:22:07.260]  like the culture as common wisdom, you know,
[02:22:07.260 --> 02:22:08.980]  it could become the next quit all your apps thing
[02:22:08.980 --> 02:22:10.580]  where it's actively harmful.
[02:22:10.580 --> 02:22:13.300]  That's why I wrote, when I linked to your thing,
[02:22:13.300 --> 02:22:15.540]  that it's the perception, like to me,
[02:22:15.540 --> 02:22:17.500]  the biggest problem with this trend
[02:22:17.500 --> 02:22:20.020]  and the resonation that your post got
[02:22:20.020 --> 02:22:24.520]  is that it's, by Apple leaving these things,
[02:22:24.520 --> 02:22:26.100]  you know, like as you put it, you know,
[02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:29.000]  leaving some ground at the functional,
[02:22:29.940 --> 02:22:32.100]  leaving some of the area at the functional high ground,
[02:22:32.100 --> 02:22:33.300]  whatever you call it.
[02:22:33.300 --> 02:22:35.580]  Yeah, not my best title ever.
[02:22:35.580 --> 02:22:37.900]  Although I don't, I disagree with your analysis
[02:22:37.900 --> 02:22:40.100]  that you have to lose the high ground
[02:22:40.100 --> 02:22:41.380]  to someone else.
[02:22:41.380 --> 02:22:42.660]  I think you can lose, like,
[02:22:42.660 --> 02:22:44.300]  cause if you think about the moral high ground,
[02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:46.380]  you can lose the moral high ground
[02:22:46.380 --> 02:22:49.540]  without someone else becoming better than you at it.
[02:22:49.540 --> 02:22:51.780]  You can just become worse at it yourself.
[02:22:51.780 --> 02:22:53.620]  Yeah, I know what you mean.
[02:22:53.620 --> 02:22:56.860]  It's not quite, it's not quite fair
[02:22:56.860 --> 02:22:59.060]  that I said that you have to lose it to them.
[02:22:59.060 --> 02:23:00.500]  I do think it's an important point.
[02:23:00.500 --> 02:23:03.840]  I worry though that the fact that I thought that way,
[02:23:05.540 --> 02:23:07.180]  it occurred to me later, rethinking that,
[02:23:07.180 --> 02:23:09.220]  that it could be a worrisome sign
[02:23:09.220 --> 02:23:11.460]  that if Apple, people inside Apple see it the same way,
[02:23:11.460 --> 02:23:12.660]  well, who did we lose it to,
[02:23:12.660 --> 02:23:15.500]  that you're blind to a problem.
[02:23:15.500 --> 02:23:16.340]  Right.
[02:23:16.340 --> 02:23:17.160]  And what I did see though right away
[02:23:17.160 --> 02:23:20.320]  is that it's, that to me is already a problem
[02:23:20.320 --> 02:23:24.300]  and is the fact that so many people seem to agree with you
[02:23:24.300 --> 02:23:27.860]  is a problem and it's the perception because,
[02:23:27.860 --> 02:23:30.220]  and it doesn't matter whether we're overreacting
[02:23:30.220 --> 02:23:31.420]  or whether most people are,
[02:23:31.420 --> 02:23:33.860]  if that becomes their perception,
[02:23:33.860 --> 02:23:35.520]  it's hard for Apple to shake that.
[02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:36.980]  They can fix the bugs.
[02:23:36.980 --> 02:23:39.820]  They can significantly improve the quality
[02:23:39.820 --> 02:23:42.400]  of their platforms across the board
[02:23:42.400 --> 02:23:45.400]  and people won't notice because there's this perception
[02:23:45.400 --> 02:23:47.100]  that the stuff doesn't work right.
[02:23:48.040 --> 02:23:49.360]  And there's a lot of reasons
[02:23:49.360 --> 02:23:51.100]  why that perception is reasonable.
[02:23:51.100 --> 02:23:54.940]  If you look at the various issues people have had
[02:23:54.940 --> 02:23:58.460]  applying iOS updates over the last couple of years,
[02:23:58.460 --> 02:24:00.500]  if you look at how iOS updates have performed
[02:24:00.500 --> 02:24:02.540]  on old hardware over the last couple of years,
[02:24:02.540 --> 02:24:05.420]  a lot of people are understandably wary.
[02:24:05.420 --> 02:24:08.380]  They've gotten burned before and they like,
[02:24:08.380 --> 02:24:10.040]  now they're like, well, I don't wanna install the new update
[02:24:10.040 --> 02:24:12.220]  because I heard it broke some people's phones
[02:24:12.220 --> 02:24:14.600]  or it broke my phone or it made my phone really slow.
[02:24:14.600 --> 02:24:16.260]  Well, the one that they pushed, it was bad
[02:24:16.260 --> 02:24:17.680]  because there's always gonna be bugs
[02:24:17.680 --> 02:24:21.280]  and there's always gonna be weird, who knows?
[02:24:21.280 --> 02:24:24.080]  Like a freaking ion from outer space
[02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:25.360]  hits your phone the wrong way
[02:24:25.360 --> 02:24:28.300]  and corrupts some part of the OS
[02:24:28.300 --> 02:24:30.860]  and if something in the flash memory gets corrupted
[02:24:31.800 --> 02:24:34.380]  and a software update bricks your phone
[02:24:34.380 --> 02:24:36.740]  and doesn't brick your wife's phone.
[02:24:36.740 --> 02:24:40.900]  Well, one in 10,000 get bricked by an update.
[02:24:40.900 --> 02:24:42.000]  Well, those sort of bugs happen.
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:42.980]  They suck, but they happen.
[02:24:42.980 --> 02:24:44.920]  You can't say you can never do that.
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:46.180]  But I think it's fair to say
[02:24:46.180 --> 02:24:48.420]  you can never push out an over the air update
[02:24:48.420 --> 02:24:50.620]  that bricks every phone that takes it.
[02:24:50.620 --> 02:24:51.460]  Right.
[02:24:51.460 --> 02:24:54.460]  Like that was just an inexcusable slip
[02:24:54.460 --> 02:24:57.060]  and creates, again, this perception
[02:24:57.060 --> 02:25:00.820]  that when your phone tells you, hey, there's a new iOS,
[02:25:00.820 --> 02:25:02.240]  you should not be worried.
[02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:05.140]  You shouldn't think, oh, God.
[02:25:05.140 --> 02:25:08.380]  I know some people who just keep that red badge
[02:25:08.380 --> 02:25:12.760]  on the Settings app because they don't wanna install it.
[02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:15.620]  Oh, yeah, my mom's phone is still running iOS 6
[02:25:15.620 --> 02:25:16.980]  because when iOS 7 came out,
[02:25:16.980 --> 02:25:18.740]  she saw on the news about the motion sickness
[02:25:18.740 --> 02:25:20.940]  and she got scared and she refused to install iOS 7.
[02:25:20.940 --> 02:25:22.060]  She's never even seen it.
[02:25:22.060 --> 02:25:24.540]  All right, so she's just got a red badge on her Settings app.
[02:25:24.540 --> 02:25:26.580]  Yeah, for the last two years.
[02:25:26.580 --> 02:25:28.140]  She'll get it when she gets a new phone.
[02:25:28.140 --> 02:25:28.960]  Yeah.
[02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:31.000]  That's so funny.
[02:25:33.960 --> 02:25:35.840]  Anyway, I think that perception is important.
[02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:38.720]  And I'll relate it to the Newton.
[02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:42.180]  And I know it was a very different Apple in the 90s
[02:25:42.180 --> 02:25:43.320]  and they were so small
[02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:47.600]  and something like the Newton appealed to so few people.
[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:49.080]  But it was mainstream enough
[02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:53.280]  that everybody cites the Doonesbury cartoon
[02:25:53.280 --> 02:25:56.240]  that made fun of it and the Simpsons made fun of it too.
[02:25:56.240 --> 02:25:57.660]  So I mean, it was popular enough
[02:25:57.660 --> 02:26:00.400]  that it was grist for Simpsons gags.
[02:26:01.640 --> 02:26:03.620]  It got that stink on it
[02:26:03.620 --> 02:26:06.040]  that the handwriting recognition doesn't work
[02:26:06.040 --> 02:26:08.040]  so that you could make Doonesbury
[02:26:08.040 --> 02:26:09.860]  and Simpsons gags about it.
[02:26:09.860 --> 02:26:11.200]  It didn't take that long though
[02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:13.620]  before the handwriting got pretty darn good
[02:26:13.620 --> 02:26:16.800]  on like the MessagePad 2000.
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:19.720]  It was about as good as you could hope
[02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:24.100]  that like a 1995, 1996 computer
[02:26:24.100 --> 02:26:25.540]  could recognize your handwriting.
[02:26:25.540 --> 02:26:27.180]  It was really pretty good.
[02:26:27.180 --> 02:26:29.880]  Nobody really got, everybody, you'd say Newton,
[02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:32.760]  they'd say goofy, terrible handwriting recognition.
[02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:35.640]  Right, well, most of them also had never tried one.
[02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:40.080]  No, but if Apple Watch comes out and in the first year,
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:41.560]  it seems like none of the stuff
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:43.360]  it's supposed to do works reliably,
[02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:47.420]  that'd be hard to shake even if they fix it.
[02:26:47.420 --> 02:26:48.500]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:26:48.500 --> 02:26:50.120]  Like it's really important
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:54.880]  that it does everything it's supposed to do pretty well.
[02:26:54.880 --> 02:26:56.640]  And again, that sounds like a stupid thing to say.
[02:26:56.640 --> 02:26:59.080]  It sounds like, well, everything should do
[02:26:59.080 --> 02:27:00.560]  what it's supposed to do pretty well.
[02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:02.720]  But like with a new product, it's essential
[02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:06.720]  because the first impression is so much,
[02:27:06.720 --> 02:27:10.400]  it informs a decade of what you're gonna think of it.
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:13.920]  Like the first iPhone, it was so important
[02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:15.800]  that it really was an amazing device.
[02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:18.720]  It really couldn't be a bad device.
[02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:21.400]  And there's a substantial number of people
[02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:25.120]  both just who can't wait for Apple to fail
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:26.720]  so they can talk about it and make fun of it
[02:27:26.720 --> 02:27:28.480]  and point it out and laugh.
[02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:29.920]  And also a lot of people
[02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:32.120]  who are going to be looking for a reason
[02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:34.400]  are gonna be looking for a reason for Apple
[02:27:34.400 --> 02:27:36.800]  not to fail somehow.
[02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:38.360]  They're like waiting for Apple to fail.
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:40.760]  And there's also gonna be a lot of people out there
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:43.000]  who are looking for reasons
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:44.880]  why they don't need to care about the Apple Watch.
[02:27:44.880 --> 02:27:46.840]  They're looking for an excuse not to buy it.
[02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:50.120]  They're looking for a reason to rule it out in their head
[02:27:50.120 --> 02:27:52.680]  as irrelevant, fail, move on.
[02:27:52.680 --> 02:27:55.840]  And so any ammo that is provided to that
[02:27:55.840 --> 02:27:58.080]  is going to get amplified like crazy.
[02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:00.120]  And they have to be very careful
[02:28:00.120 --> 02:28:01.720]  not to give much ammo to that.
[02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:03.000]  There's gonna be some kind of gate
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:04.720]  with everything Apple launches now.
[02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:06.240]  Every stupid gate that comes out
[02:28:06.240 --> 02:28:08.240]  every time there's a new iPhone.
[02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:10.080]  There's gonna be some kind of watch gate
[02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:12.920]  and they have to make sure that it's something
[02:28:12.920 --> 02:28:17.240]  that's reasonably stupid like Bendgate
[02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:18.600]  and not something serious.
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:21.440]  Right, well, imagine if it's a real thing.
[02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:24.120]  If Bendgate got as much publicity as it did
[02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:26.600]  and it was mostly nonsense
[02:28:26.600 --> 02:28:29.920]  and Antennagate got the enormous publicity it got
[02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:33.160]  and was in the long run mostly nonsense.
[02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:37.200]  Imagine a real problem.
[02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:40.640]  You're supposed to be able to hold the button
[02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:44.160]  and dictate your texts to your watch.
[02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:46.340]  And if instead you just get a spinner
[02:28:46.340 --> 02:28:47.800]  that spins and spins and spins
[02:28:47.800 --> 02:28:50.440]  and you never get your text, that's a problem.
[02:28:50.440 --> 02:28:53.120]  Right, exactly, and so these quality things
[02:28:53.120 --> 02:28:55.720]  are extremely, you know, this is like,
[02:28:55.720 --> 02:28:58.760]  when I've been critical of their developer policies recently
[02:28:58.760 --> 02:29:00.840]  one of the things I've said is like
[02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:02.900]  this is strategically a very bad time
[02:29:02.900 --> 02:29:04.360]  to have problems in this area
[02:29:04.360 --> 02:29:05.720]  because the watch is coming out.
[02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:07.760]  And when the watch is coming out
[02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:10.400]  you need the quality of everything
[02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:13.320]  that's powering it on the phone side,
[02:29:13.320 --> 02:29:14.760]  everything that's supplying it with the data,
[02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:15.580]  the Bluetooth stuff that you said,
[02:29:15.580 --> 02:29:18.260]  you need the quality of that to be tip-top
[02:29:18.260 --> 02:29:20.300]  so that way the watch can at least focus on
[02:29:20.300 --> 02:29:22.300]  it's like, you know, those teams can rely on that
[02:29:22.300 --> 02:29:25.480]  and then the watch can have the solid foundation under it.
[02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:29.920]  And you also need developers who are empowered
[02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:32.580]  and willing and happy to be developing apps
[02:29:32.580 --> 02:29:34.960]  for this platform and that are gonna push the boundaries
[02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:36.260]  and make cool apps for it.
[02:29:37.280 --> 02:29:40.000]  So two things that Mark Gurman reported
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:41.240]  I think on the same day this week,
[02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:43.200]  but he reported first about that,
[02:29:43.200 --> 02:29:47.320]  this, you know, showing mock-ups of a 12-inch MacBook Air.
[02:29:47.320 --> 02:29:50.280]  But he also said the date that Apple's planning
[02:29:50.280 --> 02:29:52.600]  for a March release date of Apple Watch.
[02:29:52.600 --> 02:29:55.260]  Did that, that surprised me a little, if it's true.
[02:29:55.260 --> 02:29:57.360]  That sounded late to me.
[02:29:57.360 --> 02:29:58.200]  Oh, really?
[02:29:58.200 --> 02:29:59.020]  I thought that sounded early.
[02:29:59.020 --> 02:30:02.360]  I really expected like April or May.
[02:30:02.360 --> 02:30:03.480]  Maybe, I don't know.
[02:30:03.480 --> 02:30:05.200]  I, you know, I think we heard rumblings
[02:30:05.200 --> 02:30:07.440]  a couple of weeks ago that it would be like February,
[02:30:07.440 --> 02:30:08.640]  but it doesn't really matter.
[02:30:08.640 --> 02:30:10.640]  I mean, you know, it'll come out when it's out.
[02:30:10.640 --> 02:30:14.040]  I would rather have it come out when it's better
[02:30:14.040 --> 02:30:15.880]  than come out when it's not quite ready yet.
[02:30:15.880 --> 02:30:18.520]  So that's fine, it doesn't really matter.
[02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:21.840]  Yeah, you know, I guess it's just the pessimist to me.
[02:30:21.840 --> 02:30:25.440]  They say early 2015, I hear before June.
[02:30:25.440 --> 02:30:27.320]  Yeah, you hear May 31st.
[02:30:27.320 --> 02:30:28.880]  Right.
[02:30:28.880 --> 02:30:31.000]  Whereas I guess the more honest way of looking at it
[02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:32.880]  is early is first quarter.
[02:30:32.880 --> 02:30:34.760]  I don't know, so maybe it will.
[02:30:34.760 --> 02:30:36.320]  I'm a little surprised by that.
[02:30:37.360 --> 02:30:41.320]  It also makes me wonder whether I should be on my feet
[02:30:41.320 --> 02:30:46.080]  for an Apple event, you know, sooner rather than later.
[02:30:46.080 --> 02:30:50.280]  I mean, I think an Apple event is fair game anytime.
[02:30:50.280 --> 02:30:52.240]  I mean, I wouldn't expect it like next week,
[02:30:52.240 --> 02:30:55.520]  but I would, you know, if there was an event in February
[02:30:55.520 --> 02:30:57.680]  with availability a couple of weeks later,
[02:30:57.680 --> 02:30:59.680]  that wouldn't surprise me.
[02:30:59.680 --> 02:31:01.080]  Yeah, me neither.
[02:31:01.080 --> 02:31:03.280]  So Gurman's other story is this Blockbuster
[02:31:03.280 --> 02:31:04.800]  12-inch MacBook Air.
[02:31:05.720 --> 02:31:07.000]  Yeah, with one port.
[02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:10.280]  With one port, which is so crazy
[02:31:10.280 --> 02:31:13.480]  that I think it's probably true.
[02:31:13.480 --> 02:31:14.560]  Yeah, well two with the headphone,
[02:31:14.560 --> 02:31:15.680]  but that doesn't really count.
[02:31:15.680 --> 02:31:16.520]  Right.
[02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:20.880]  And I thought Snell's reaction was perfect
[02:31:20.880 --> 02:31:22.680]  where he was just like, ah, that's crazy.
[02:31:22.680 --> 02:31:24.880]  Well, yeah, okay.
[02:31:24.880 --> 02:31:27.800]  Yeah, it's like, if you would have,
[02:31:27.800 --> 02:31:29.760]  I don't remember if the first MacBook Air
[02:31:29.760 --> 02:31:31.520]  had any rumors leaked, I don't think it did.
[02:31:31.520 --> 02:31:34.840]  No, it was a total surprise, as I recall.
[02:31:34.840 --> 02:31:37.520]  I recall it being like a holy shit, I cannot believe that.
[02:31:37.520 --> 02:31:38.800]  Right, exactly, I think you're right.
[02:31:38.800 --> 02:31:39.640]  So anyway.
[02:31:39.640 --> 02:31:43.200]  And I think the slogan, I think it was at WWDC?
[02:31:43.200 --> 02:31:44.520]  I just remembered there was something that said
[02:31:44.520 --> 02:31:45.760]  there's something in the air.
[02:31:45.760 --> 02:31:47.240]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:31:47.240 --> 02:31:52.240]  And so if we would have heard rumors about that beforehand,
[02:31:52.640 --> 02:31:54.360]  and we would have heard crazy things like,
[02:31:54.360 --> 02:31:56.080]  because that was also, was that the first one
[02:31:56.080 --> 02:31:57.840]  that didn't have an optical drive?
[02:31:57.840 --> 02:31:58.680]  Yeah.
[02:31:58.680 --> 02:31:59.760]  I think it was, yeah, because they launched
[02:31:59.760 --> 02:32:01.040]  the external one with it.
[02:32:01.040 --> 02:32:03.320]  Yeah, because everybody, among the many,
[02:32:03.320 --> 02:32:04.560]  how can they do this, it's impossible.
[02:32:04.560 --> 02:32:05.880]  It's like, how can they ship a thing with,
[02:32:05.880 --> 02:32:07.240]  how are you gonna install the OS?
[02:32:07.240 --> 02:32:12.240]  Right, so they shipped this 3.0 pound laptop
[02:32:12.240 --> 02:32:14.680]  at the time when everything else was 5.5 pounds.
[02:32:14.680 --> 02:32:16.640]  They shipped this 3.0 pound laptop
[02:32:16.640 --> 02:32:20.800]  that fit in a mailing envelope and was super thin
[02:32:20.800 --> 02:32:22.560]  and had this sharp edge in the front
[02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:27.240]  and had no optical drive and sometimes no hard drive,
[02:32:27.240 --> 02:32:32.240]  one USB port, it was so much smaller
[02:32:32.920 --> 02:32:34.920]  they had to make a separate power adapter for it
[02:32:34.920 --> 02:32:36.680]  that even the power adapter was smaller.
[02:32:36.680 --> 02:32:39.240]  Even the plug on the end of it was a different shape
[02:32:39.240 --> 02:32:40.800]  to fit the beveled edge.
[02:32:40.800 --> 02:32:43.240]  You had this door, the ports folded out from this door.
[02:32:43.240 --> 02:32:45.040]  I mean, there was so much about it
[02:32:45.040 --> 02:32:46.760]  that if you would have heard it ahead of time,
[02:32:46.760 --> 02:32:48.120]  and even when it did come out,
[02:32:48.120 --> 02:32:49.840]  everyone was like, that's crazy.
[02:32:49.840 --> 02:32:53.920]  It was January 2008, it was Macworld Expo.
[02:32:53.920 --> 02:32:54.760]  There you go, all right, yeah.
[02:32:54.760 --> 02:32:58.160]  So it was the year after the iPhone introduction
[02:32:58.160 --> 02:33:01.960]  at Macworld, it was another big introduction at Macworld.
[02:33:01.960 --> 02:33:03.400]  Yeah, I have to go back and rewatch that
[02:33:03.400 --> 02:33:04.640]  and try to like gauge the reaction,
[02:33:04.640 --> 02:33:07.040]  because like, and I actually, I had one of those.
[02:33:07.040 --> 02:33:09.480]  David at Tumblr got me one of those as a bonus,
[02:33:09.480 --> 02:33:11.960]  because I had mentioned how I wanted to light a laptop
[02:33:11.960 --> 02:33:12.800]  and it was very nice of him.
[02:33:12.800 --> 02:33:16.120]  So I had one of those and it was ungodly slow.
[02:33:16.120 --> 02:33:18.080]  I mean, because I had the hard drive model,
[02:33:18.080 --> 02:33:22.480]  so it was like, it was this 1.8 inch iPod hard drive
[02:33:22.480 --> 02:33:26.760]  in there, because the SSD option was $1,000 more
[02:33:26.760 --> 02:33:30.840]  and 64 gigs, or you can get the iPod hard drive,
[02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:32.560]  which was 80 gigs, which is what I got.
[02:33:32.560 --> 02:33:35.200]  I remember Shipley got the SSD version
[02:33:35.200 --> 02:33:36.720]  and it was like, I know it sounds crazy,
[02:33:36.720 --> 02:33:38.280]  but it's a great development machine
[02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:41.200]  because SSDs are so great for development
[02:33:41.200 --> 02:33:42.440]  because you're dealing with, you know,
[02:33:42.440 --> 02:33:44.160]  hundreds of tiny little files.
[02:33:44.160 --> 02:33:46.360]  Yeah, and in 2008, when this thing came out,
[02:33:46.360 --> 02:33:49.080]  that like SSDs were extremely rare.
[02:33:49.080 --> 02:33:50.400]  It was one of the first computers
[02:33:50.400 --> 02:33:52.160]  to even offer it as an option.
[02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:53.800]  I don't think it was the first,
[02:33:53.800 --> 02:33:55.200]  but it was one of the first.
[02:33:55.200 --> 02:33:58.680]  And so like, that machine when it came out
[02:33:58.680 --> 02:34:01.040]  had all these crazy limitations
[02:34:01.040 --> 02:34:02.800]  and a lot of flaws.
[02:34:02.800 --> 02:34:05.240]  I mean, like the CPU, we talked a little bit on ATP,
[02:34:05.240 --> 02:34:08.460]  like the CPU on a lot of them would overheat and throttle.
[02:34:08.460 --> 02:34:10.620]  So like you couldn't watch YouTube videos.
[02:34:10.620 --> 02:34:13.320]  Like you couldn't play flash video
[02:34:13.320 --> 02:34:15.720]  for more than a few seconds before it started dropping frames
[02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:17.480]  because the CPU was overheating and throttling.
[02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:20.080]  I actually, on mine, I ran an underclocking utility
[02:34:20.080 --> 02:34:22.400]  that would underclock and undervolt the chip
[02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:23.820]  to keep it running cooler.
[02:34:23.820 --> 02:34:26.920]  So that way it could sustain its peak usage
[02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:29.520]  for enough time to play videos smoothly.
[02:34:29.520 --> 02:34:33.160]  But like it was a crazy machine.
[02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:35.260]  It was way ahead of its time.
[02:34:35.260 --> 02:34:37.120]  And in many ways that was a bad thing.
[02:34:37.120 --> 02:34:40.640]  It made it, you know, the performance was just dismal.
[02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:45.000]  It was extremely inconvenient to move files to it
[02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:48.560]  because it only had 802.11g,
[02:34:48.560 --> 02:34:50.960]  or I think it was the draft N wireless.
[02:34:50.960 --> 02:34:51.800]  So like, you know,
[02:34:51.800 --> 02:34:54.040]  wireless was still a lot slower back then.
[02:34:54.040 --> 02:34:57.680]  And it only had a single USB 2.0 port,
[02:34:57.680 --> 02:35:01.520]  no FireWire, no Thunderbolt, USB 2.0.
[02:35:01.520 --> 02:35:03.680]  And you could like, you could send files to it
[02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:05.480]  over wireless, which would take forever.
[02:35:05.480 --> 02:35:07.300]  Or you could get the wired ethernet adapter,
[02:35:07.300 --> 02:35:11.720]  the USB one that was only 10.100 and ran over USB 2.0.
[02:35:11.720 --> 02:35:13.600]  And USB 2.0 is a horrible protocol.
[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:17.320]  And so like transferring files to it would just take hours.
[02:35:17.320 --> 02:35:18.760]  It like, if you wanted to like put a bunch of like
[02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:20.480]  movies on, when you go on a big trip or something,
[02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:22.360]  it would just take hours.
[02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:25.440]  It was unbearable to use in many contexts.
[02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:30.320]  But what was so new about it being so incredibly thin
[02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:32.400]  and light, mostly light,
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:33.920]  the thinness was kind of a nice bonus,
[02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:36.680]  but it was mostly the weight being so radically
[02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:38.920]  much smaller than everything else.
[02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:42.960]  That was so good that this machine was quite compelling
[02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:44.300]  for a lot of people.
[02:35:44.300 --> 02:35:47.260]  It was not good enough to be your only computer
[02:35:47.260 --> 02:35:48.180]  for most people.
[02:35:48.180 --> 02:35:50.200]  And some people pulled it off, but for the most part,
[02:35:50.200 --> 02:35:51.880]  it wasn't gonna be your only one.
[02:35:51.880 --> 02:35:54.560]  Right, because it only had 64 gigs of storage.
[02:35:54.560 --> 02:35:57.520]  Right, or 80 if you had the beautifully slow one.
[02:35:59.760 --> 02:36:02.400]  At a time when you had a lot less cloud storage.
[02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:03.820]  Yeah.
[02:36:03.820 --> 02:36:05.540]  Yeah, like you had to keep a lot more,
[02:36:05.540 --> 02:36:07.320]  you had to keep everything you had locally.
[02:36:07.320 --> 02:36:09.400]  Like there was no such thing as like,
[02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:11.560]  oh, I'm gonna keep everything I have on Dropbox.
[02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:12.940]  I only synced this one little folder over,
[02:36:12.940 --> 02:36:14.720]  or I'm gonna keep everything on,
[02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:16.520]  I don't think iTunes match was out yet.
[02:36:16.520 --> 02:36:17.760]  No, not even close.
[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:20.920]  It was a much worse time to have very limited storage.
[02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:25.480]  And so, but you know, people made it work,
[02:36:25.480 --> 02:36:28.340]  and it wasn't overall a great machine,
[02:36:28.340 --> 02:36:31.320]  but it was really compelling in a few key areas.
[02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:33.800]  So now, bringing it forward, and you know,
[02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:35.960]  in 2010 they made the better MacBook Airs,
[02:36:35.960 --> 02:36:38.240]  and SSDs started getting bigger and cheaper,
[02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:41.440]  and they went all SSD, and the 2010 and forward
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:43.560]  MacBook Airs are far better machines.
[02:36:43.560 --> 02:36:48.560]  But, and now, like they pointed out on Connected this week.
[02:36:48.560 --> 02:36:52.000]  I don't even think it's, I don't think there's any argument
[02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:55.040]  that for most people who, it's the most popular Mac
[02:36:55.040 --> 02:36:57.720]  Apple sells, and for most people it's their only Mac.
[02:36:57.720 --> 02:37:00.200]  Yeah, I mean, you know, if someone comes to me
[02:37:00.200 --> 02:37:01.880]  and says, what Mac should I buy?
[02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:03.840]  And they don't give me any other information.
[02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:08.000]  If I need to have a no questions asked answer to that,
[02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.200]  the answer is a 13 inch MacBook Air.
[02:37:10.200 --> 02:37:11.040]  Yep.
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:12.280]  Like that's the answer.
[02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:13.120]  That's the default.
[02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:15.160]  I interrupted you, you said something about the Connected?
[02:37:15.160 --> 02:37:17.800]  Yeah, so they mentioned this on this week.
[02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:19.360]  They were saying, pointing out how like, you know,
[02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:23.360]  the MacBook Air used to be this high end.
[02:37:23.360 --> 02:37:26.920]  It started out, it was 1800 or 1600 dollars.
[02:37:26.920 --> 02:37:31.240]  It was priced above the other, above the 13 inch MacBook.
[02:37:31.240 --> 02:37:32.080]  Yep.
[02:37:32.080 --> 02:37:36.480]  And it was a premium product to be slower and smaller
[02:37:36.480 --> 02:37:39.320]  and everything, but it was so much more portable.
[02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:41.860]  It was like getting a little convertible coupe.
[02:37:41.860 --> 02:37:44.200]  Exactly, perfect analogy.
[02:37:44.200 --> 02:37:47.040]  And so yeah, it probably shouldn't be your family sedan,
[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:50.920]  but you know, it is a fun like little, you know,
[02:37:50.920 --> 02:37:51.760]  little portable.
[02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:56.240]  And so like, the original MacBook Air was this premium thing
[02:37:56.240 --> 02:38:00.400]  that's had above the rest of the line relative to its size.
[02:38:00.400 --> 02:38:02.480]  Yeah, imagine for like business travelers who, you know,
[02:38:02.480 --> 02:38:03.840]  do a lot of typing on, you know,
[02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:05.580]  coach seats on an airplane.
[02:38:05.580 --> 02:38:07.740]  It was, you know, I hate to say it.
[02:38:07.740 --> 02:38:09.440]  It's such a cliche, it was a game changer.
[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:12.260]  Yeah, I mean, and for those that got the SSD,
[02:38:12.260 --> 02:38:14.040]  I think it was like 3400 dollars.
[02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:17.200]  It was some crazy amount of money.
[02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:20.640]  But you know, so it was this premium,
[02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:22.680]  awesome sports coupe kind of thing.
[02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:25.000]  Since then, as I pointed out on Unconnected,
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000]  it has actually become the bottom of the line.
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.180]  Like it is filtered down now,
[02:38:29.180 --> 02:38:31.720]  like there is no regular MacBook anymore,
[02:38:31.720 --> 02:38:33.780]  or there's that one model left over
[02:38:33.780 --> 02:38:35.120]  that they bury on the site.
[02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:37.840]  But for the most part, like the bottom of the Mac line
[02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:39.440]  is the MacBook Air.
[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:42.920]  And so this, if you think about this crazy new
[02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:45.520]  one port rumor that Germin had with the 12 inch
[02:38:45.520 --> 02:38:48.480]  being this like crazy new premium thing,
[02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:51.480]  if you think about that not as a replacement
[02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:54.680]  to the 11 inch MacBook Air that exists today,
[02:38:54.680 --> 02:38:56.720]  but if you think about it in more of the style
[02:38:56.720 --> 02:38:58.920]  that the original was relative to its siblings
[02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:02.120]  in the lineup, this kind of mid-range,
[02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:04.840]  or like this mid-price thing, probably, you know,
[02:39:04.840 --> 02:39:08.520]  1500 dollar range type thing, or maybe a little bit more.
[02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:10.520]  We'll see how it specs out.
[02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:13.800]  But think about it as like not the low end of the lineup,
[02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:15.940]  but a mid-range of the lineup that in some ways
[02:39:15.940 --> 02:39:18.680]  is more limited and worse than the MacBook Airs
[02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:22.640]  that we know today, possibly by having this one port,
[02:39:22.640 --> 02:39:26.000]  or by, if it uses any of these new Intel Broadwell
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:27.800]  core and processors, it'll be a lot slower.
[02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:31.040]  It'll be roughly iPad speed, which is not slow
[02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:33.240]  by absolute terms for the most part,
[02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:35.920]  but relative to the other CPU that's, you know,
[02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:37.680]  it's not gonna be in the same class.
[02:39:37.680 --> 02:39:42.680]  It's always a moment when a next generation machine
[02:39:43.080 --> 02:39:45.360]  is slower than what came before.
[02:39:45.360 --> 02:39:46.200]  Exactly.
[02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:47.320]  And there might be good reasons for it,
[02:39:47.320 --> 02:39:50.000]  but it still is not the way the industry works.
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.880]  Right, and the first MacBook Air was a big example of that,
[02:39:52.880 --> 02:39:55.080]  and it got trashed initially, like I remember
[02:39:55.080 --> 02:39:56.520]  when Macworld first reviewed it,
[02:39:56.520 --> 02:39:58.040]  and I think it was Jason who wrote it,
[02:39:58.040 --> 02:39:59.200]  when they first reviewed it, they were like,
[02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:02.240]  this is like the slowest Mac we've tested in a while.
[02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:05.480]  And it was the slowest one in the whole lineup at the time.
[02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:08.760]  But anyway, if we think about it in that context
[02:40:08.760 --> 02:40:10.660]  as maybe it's something like that,
[02:40:11.860 --> 02:40:14.840]  I think that leaves room for it to suck in a few ways.
[02:40:14.840 --> 02:40:16.840]  That leaves room for it to be limited in a few ways,
[02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:21.280]  for it to say, this is gonna be a niche premium thing
[02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:26.000]  that's gonna extremely prioritize certain physical factors
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.840]  in exchange for, you know, extreme something,
[02:40:28.840 --> 02:40:30.900]  extreme portability, maybe extreme battery life,
[02:40:30.900 --> 02:40:33.000]  probably not, I'm actually guessing the battery life
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:34.960]  is gonna be mediocre on it.
[02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:37.320]  But, you know, it's gonna prioritize
[02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:40.120]  thinness and lightness and size, it seems.
[02:40:40.120 --> 02:40:40.960]  If these-
[02:40:40.960 --> 02:40:41.800]  Above all else.
[02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:43.260]  Exactly, above all else, including battery life,
[02:40:43.260 --> 02:40:44.100]  most likely.
[02:40:44.100 --> 02:40:45.240]  It's gonna make your existing MacBook Air
[02:40:45.240 --> 02:40:46.440]  feel thick and heavy.
[02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:48.600]  Exactly, the same way the original MacBook Air
[02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:53.000]  made even the 13-inch MacBook feel just like a brick.
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:56.000]  Like, you know, if they can pull that off,
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.400]  it's gonna be really interesting.
[02:40:58.400 --> 02:41:02.480]  I do have a slight concern in this area
[02:41:02.480 --> 02:41:06.880]  that I do think, you know, you certainly have,
[02:41:06.880 --> 02:41:09.740]  to some degree, you have diminishing returns here.
[02:41:09.740 --> 02:41:11.680]  When the original MacBook Air came out,
[02:41:11.680 --> 02:41:14.400]  it was like half the weight, or close to it,
[02:41:14.400 --> 02:41:17.320]  of the 13-inch MacBook at the time.
[02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:22.640]  How much lighter can it get while still having
[02:41:22.640 --> 02:41:25.720]  a keyboard, a screen, a battery of some kind,
[02:41:25.720 --> 02:41:27.600]  an aluminum case around the whole thing?
[02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:29.860]  Like, I don't think they're gonna be able
[02:41:29.860 --> 02:41:31.780]  to nail half the weight.
[02:41:31.780 --> 02:41:34.620]  Like, I don't think, it probably can't go that low.
[02:41:34.620 --> 02:41:36.200]  And we're already talking, these are already
[02:41:36.200 --> 02:41:38.440]  very thin and light computers as they are today.
[02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:40.920]  So, to make it even thinner, even lighter,
[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:43.040]  for something that is not handheld,
[02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:45.200]  like, it matters more in an iPad or an iPhone
[02:41:45.200 --> 02:41:46.520]  because it's handheld.
[02:41:46.520 --> 02:41:47.760]  For something that's on a desk or a lap
[02:41:47.760 --> 02:41:49.920]  most of the time, or a tray table,
[02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:53.000]  the weight is, you know, it matters to a point,
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:56.520]  but, like, if the computer goes from,
[02:41:56.520 --> 02:41:59.480]  I mean, the kernel oven is what, like 2.2, 2.5,
[02:41:59.480 --> 02:42:00.560]  something like that, pounds?
[02:42:00.560 --> 02:42:02.240]  Yeah, I'm bad at remembering what they are.
[02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:03.280]  It's something like that.
[02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:04.980]  Like, I know what it feels like,
[02:42:04.980 --> 02:42:06.080]  I don't know what the number is.
[02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:09.200]  Right, but, like, if it goes from 2.5 pounds
[02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:13.400]  to 1.8 pounds, or if it goes from 2.2 to 1.5,
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:15.280]  like, that's a big difference on paper,
[02:42:15.280 --> 02:42:16.660]  it's a big percentage difference,
[02:42:16.660 --> 02:42:20.800]  but, like, your whole bag weighs, like, 15 pounds.
[02:42:20.800 --> 02:42:24.500]  Even, like, a backpack empty weighs more than that, usually.
[02:42:24.500 --> 02:42:27.320]  And so, like, you know, you might not even notice
[02:42:27.320 --> 02:42:28.160]  the weight difference.
[02:42:28.160 --> 02:42:32.280]  So, I do worry they might be prioritizing
[02:42:32.280 --> 02:42:36.600]  thinness and extreme lightness
[02:42:36.600 --> 02:42:38.700]  a little bit too much, in this case,
[02:42:38.700 --> 02:42:43.280]  if it'll come at the expense of battery life.
[02:42:43.280 --> 02:42:45.580]  Because I think this is the kind of machine that,
[02:42:45.580 --> 02:42:49.680]  the battery life on the current MacBook Airs is good.
[02:42:49.680 --> 02:42:52.920]  It's not, it doesn't, it isn't, to use a term
[02:42:52.920 --> 02:42:55.760]  that used to be a verb, and is now an adjective,
[02:42:55.760 --> 02:43:00.280]  thanks to Apple, it isn't blow away, but it's good,
[02:43:00.280 --> 02:43:02.740]  they're good, like, you know, when they came out,
[02:43:02.740 --> 02:43:04.520]  they were impressive, but, you know, time has moved on,
[02:43:04.520 --> 02:43:05.760]  that's now, that's not the baseline.
[02:43:05.760 --> 02:43:09.240]  Yeah, all modern MacBooks have amazing battery life
[02:43:09.240 --> 02:43:12.440]  compared to the old days, where it was stuck at, like,
[02:43:12.440 --> 02:43:15.360]  three to four hours of effective battery life,
[02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:17.160]  no matter what, no matter which one you bought,
[02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:19.080]  no matter what you did, you know,
[02:43:19.080 --> 02:43:22.900]  turn the screen dimness down, you know,
[02:43:22.900 --> 02:43:25.000]  three to four hours is about what you could get.
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.640]  And it would lose about an hour per year of age, too.
[02:43:27.640 --> 02:43:29.020]  Yeah, pretty quickly.
[02:43:29.020 --> 02:43:32.440]  I just, as a coaster, I just always knew
[02:43:32.440 --> 02:43:34.720]  you could never really go coast to coast,
[02:43:34.720 --> 02:43:35.560]  even with a new machine.
[02:43:35.560 --> 02:43:36.620]  Right, exactly.
[02:43:36.620 --> 02:43:38.220]  You know, you kind of, you know,
[02:43:38.220 --> 02:43:39.600]  if you were gonna work on an airplane
[02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:42.020]  while you flew to San Francisco from the East Coast,
[02:43:42.020 --> 02:43:44.160]  get your work done, because you're not gonna, you know,
[02:43:44.160 --> 02:43:45.960]  it's gonna die with an hour to go.
[02:43:45.960 --> 02:43:49.200]  Exactly, and like today, if you're using a laptop,
[02:43:49.200 --> 02:43:52.460]  if you're doing like, you know, medium lifting on it,
[02:43:52.460 --> 02:43:56.920]  throughout the day, it can almost, but generally not,
[02:43:56.920 --> 02:43:58.320]  run all day on battery.
[02:43:59.180 --> 02:44:00.720]  Like, they say like, you know,
[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:01.880]  oh, you have all day battery life,
[02:44:01.880 --> 02:44:03.400]  well, it depends on what you're doing with it.
[02:44:03.400 --> 02:44:05.840]  Yeah, and if you leave your house with a solid charge,
[02:44:05.840 --> 02:44:09.440]  you can watch movies on the whole flight, no problem.
[02:44:09.440 --> 02:44:11.680]  Right, but you know, the question is like, you know,
[02:44:11.680 --> 02:44:15.520]  if you have, you know, a 40 minute layover somewhere,
[02:44:15.520 --> 02:44:18.760]  do you have to plug it in, or is it just kind of optional
[02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:20.480]  whether you plug it in, you know, that kind of thing?
[02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:25.480]  Anyway, so I think if they're using this super low power,
[02:44:26.360 --> 02:44:28.720]  you know, fanless Broadwell chip that uses,
[02:44:28.720 --> 02:44:29.960]  I forget what the wattage is on it,
[02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:33.200]  but it's very low, like 10 watts or something like that,
[02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:37.640]  they could, if they put in a similar size battery
[02:44:37.640 --> 02:44:38.760]  to the current MacBook Airs,
[02:44:38.760 --> 02:44:41.640]  that could be a very substantial battery life,
[02:44:41.640 --> 02:44:46.640]  but they might instead choose to just keep roughly,
[02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:47.720]  you know, what's the 11 inch today,
[02:44:47.720 --> 02:44:50.240]  like roughly like five hour life, something like that,
[02:44:50.240 --> 02:44:52.080]  in real use, something like that.
[02:44:52.080 --> 02:44:54.160]  I would say more than that, I think, I don't know.
[02:44:54.160 --> 02:44:55.000]  Whatever it is.
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:56.080]  Mine's old, so it's hard to say,
[02:44:56.080 --> 02:44:58.160]  but it's pretty good.
[02:44:58.160 --> 02:45:00.800]  Whatever it is, like the 11 is worse than the 13
[02:45:00.800 --> 02:45:01.840]  by a pretty good margin,
[02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:03.160]  because the 13 just has a much bigger battery,
[02:45:03.160 --> 02:45:06.160]  but it wouldn't surprise me at all,
[02:45:06.160 --> 02:45:08.360]  given what they've done with iOS devices,
[02:45:08.360 --> 02:45:13.240]  with the iPhone 6 and with the iPad Air 2 and Air 1.
[02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:16.320]  I wonder how much, if, again, this is a huge if,
[02:45:16.320 --> 02:45:19.320]  but if it's true that it really only has this one port,
[02:45:19.320 --> 02:45:23.320]  I wonder how much that is about cost
[02:45:23.320 --> 02:45:25.000]  and how much it is about using
[02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.200]  whatever space is left for battery.
[02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:30.440]  You know, that it's not so much that it would cost too much
[02:45:30.440 --> 02:45:32.400]  to add a second USB port,
[02:45:32.400 --> 02:45:37.400]  but that it's really, really, really intensive to save space.
[02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:39.480]  I would guess it's about two things,
[02:45:39.480 --> 02:45:41.360]  neither of which are very good answers.
[02:45:41.360 --> 02:45:43.200]  I would guess it's about symmetry,
[02:45:43.200 --> 02:45:47.040]  having one port on each side, and about thinness.
[02:45:47.040 --> 02:45:49.880]  That if Germin's scoop is correct,
[02:45:49.880 --> 02:45:52.920]  then it still retains the wedge teardrop shape,
[02:45:52.920 --> 02:45:56.400]  so it still is thicker at the back than it is at the front.
[02:45:56.400 --> 02:45:59.560]  And if his thickness claims are accurate,
[02:45:59.560 --> 02:46:01.760]  then there actually is not much room
[02:46:01.760 --> 02:46:04.960]  for more than the ports that it has thickness-wise.
[02:46:04.960 --> 02:46:05.800]  Right.
[02:46:05.800 --> 02:46:09.120]  And also, I would not discount the value of symmetry.
[02:46:09.120 --> 02:46:10.840]  I think symmetry is the reason why,
[02:46:10.840 --> 02:46:12.860]  on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus,
[02:46:12.860 --> 02:46:14.400]  why the sleep-wake button
[02:46:14.400 --> 02:46:16.320]  is directly across from the volume-up button,
[02:46:16.320 --> 02:46:19.480]  even though it makes it way harder to hit just one of them.
[02:46:19.480 --> 02:46:21.360]  Right, and it's the same size.
[02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:22.720]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:46:22.720 --> 02:46:25.320]  Yeah, so I would definitely not discount that
[02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:27.600]  as a possible reason why it would only be one port.
[02:46:27.600 --> 02:46:30.120]  Also, just, you know, electrically,
[02:46:30.120 --> 02:46:34.540]  like if a computer has a USB port and a FireWire port,
[02:46:34.540 --> 02:46:37.400]  those specs each demand the port be able to supply
[02:46:37.400 --> 02:46:39.520]  at least X amps of current through it,
[02:46:39.520 --> 02:46:43.000]  you know, at most to supply a device with power.
[02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:44.800]  So the more ports it has on it,
[02:46:44.800 --> 02:46:47.400]  the higher the total power output for that computer
[02:46:47.400 --> 02:46:50.520]  has to be able to have capacity for.
[02:46:50.520 --> 02:46:51.840]  Somebody on Twitter pointed out,
[02:46:51.840 --> 02:46:53.480]  and I'm so sorry I forgot your name,
[02:46:53.480 --> 02:46:57.740]  but that if it had even just two USB ports,
[02:46:57.740 --> 02:47:00.720]  and they were both USB-C, and it might have to be USB-C,
[02:47:00.720 --> 02:47:02.580]  because I think the device is too thin
[02:47:02.580 --> 02:47:04.400]  to have a traditional USB port.
[02:47:04.400 --> 02:47:05.220]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[02:47:05.220 --> 02:47:08.540]  I think the minimal size of a USB 3 port
[02:47:08.540 --> 02:47:12.200]  is thick enough that it would be a gating factor
[02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:13.720]  to make the overall device this thin.
[02:47:13.720 --> 02:47:15.520]  So it has to be the new USB.
[02:47:15.520 --> 02:47:18.760]  But if it had two, and you can,
[02:47:18.760 --> 02:47:19.920]  and they're going to use it
[02:47:19.920 --> 02:47:22.200]  for supplying power to the machine,
[02:47:22.200 --> 02:47:24.560]  you couldn't risk having two power adapters
[02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:25.960]  plugged in at the same time.
[02:47:26.840 --> 02:47:28.460]  That, I don't know if that's true or not,
[02:47:28.460 --> 02:47:31.540]  that it would, you know, like break the machine or something.
[02:47:31.540 --> 02:47:34.100]  And conversely, how do you tell people
[02:47:34.100 --> 02:47:36.900]  you can use this one for power,
[02:47:36.900 --> 02:47:39.360]  and this one, which is the same port,
[02:47:39.360 --> 02:47:41.000]  it's exactly the same size,
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.440]  it can take every other thing you can plug
[02:47:43.440 --> 02:47:45.680]  in the other one, but that one won't take a charger.
[02:47:45.680 --> 02:47:47.480]  Right, in the PC world, they would just color
[02:47:47.480 --> 02:47:48.700]  one of them like blue or something,
[02:47:48.700 --> 02:47:50.500]  and say, well, just plug in the blue one.
[02:47:50.500 --> 02:47:52.280]  But, you know, Apple won't do anything like that.
[02:47:52.280 --> 02:47:54.240]  Right, and it would just lead to confusion,
[02:47:54.240 --> 02:47:56.140]  because maybe you're running on battery power,
[02:47:56.140 --> 02:47:57.540]  and you've got a mouse plugged in one,
[02:47:57.540 --> 02:47:58.520]  and a hard drive in the other,
[02:47:58.520 --> 02:47:59.900]  but now you need power, so you think,
[02:47:59.900 --> 02:48:01.360]  well, I'll unplug the mouse.
[02:48:01.360 --> 02:48:04.400]  Oh, but I plugged the mouse in the other one,
[02:48:04.400 --> 02:48:05.920]  and the hard drive, which I can't unmount
[02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:07.480]  because I'm still copying files to it,
[02:48:07.480 --> 02:48:08.720]  is in the power one.
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:10.240]  It just doesn't, you know.
[02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:11.960]  Yeah, that's the kind of inelegant solution
[02:48:11.960 --> 02:48:13.480]  Apple is very unlikely to do.
[02:48:13.480 --> 02:48:14.760]  It actually makes some sense,
[02:48:14.760 --> 02:48:17.280]  that if you're going to use USB for power,
[02:48:17.280 --> 02:48:19.480]  and you can only have power plugged into one port,
[02:48:19.480 --> 02:48:21.640]  therefore you can only have one port.
[02:48:21.640 --> 02:48:22.920]  Exactly.
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:24.820]  So, yeah, I would expect,
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.580]  I'm guessing, like the more I think about it,
[02:48:29.580 --> 02:48:31.600]  the one port thing actually sounds plausible,
[02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:34.240]  and the more I learn about USB 3C.
[02:48:34.240 --> 02:48:37.720]  These new C ports are extremely versatile,
[02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:39.740]  and I don't know the extreme details yet,
[02:48:39.740 --> 02:48:44.460]  but they design the specs so that the port can carry power,
[02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:47.080]  seemingly in either direction.
[02:48:48.240 --> 02:48:51.020]  You could have a computer that powers the monitor,
[02:48:51.020 --> 02:48:52.160]  and drives a display,
[02:48:52.160 --> 02:48:54.320]  so you can also route display signals over it,
[02:48:54.320 --> 02:48:56.480]  and you can route high bandwidth buses over it,
[02:48:56.480 --> 02:48:57.380]  and everything.
[02:48:57.380 --> 02:48:59.500]  It's crazy how much this thing can do.
[02:48:59.500 --> 02:49:01.000]  We'll see how it works out in practice,
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:05.280]  but it's designed such that you could have
[02:49:05.280 --> 02:49:09.080]  just this one cable running from a monitor into a PC,
[02:49:09.080 --> 02:49:10.960]  and have the PC both power the monitor,
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:13.460]  and show the display signal over this one little cable.
[02:49:13.460 --> 02:49:14.300]  Yeah.
[02:49:14.300 --> 02:49:15.360]  And it's crazy.
[02:49:15.360 --> 02:49:17.040]  You know, and in terms of skating
[02:49:17.040 --> 02:49:18.160]  to where the puck is going,
[02:49:18.160 --> 02:49:21.680]  which is what the MacBook Air was at its beginning.
[02:49:21.680 --> 02:49:24.720]  So the original MacBook said no optical drives,
[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:28.800]  and now this one says no more SD cards port,
[02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:31.800]  and no USB port, extra USB port,
[02:49:31.800 --> 02:49:33.200]  where you could plug one in.
[02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:34.900]  Well, guess what?
[02:49:34.900 --> 02:49:36.900]  I think SD cards are going the way of the dodo,
[02:49:36.900 --> 02:49:40.120]  and that your photos are gonna travel over the air
[02:49:40.120 --> 02:49:41.800]  between devices.
[02:49:41.800 --> 02:49:42.640]  Right.
[02:49:42.640 --> 02:49:43.460]  And of course we're not there yet,
[02:49:43.460 --> 02:49:46.240]  and if you're the more serious a photographer you are,
[02:49:46.240 --> 02:49:48.660]  you know, the less doable that is.
[02:49:48.660 --> 02:49:50.440]  But more and more regular people
[02:49:50.440 --> 02:49:52.300]  are shooting all of their photos
[02:49:52.300 --> 02:49:54.400]  with their phones and iPads,
[02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:56.600]  and they're, you know, in the Apple universe,
[02:49:56.600 --> 02:49:59.400]  will therefore be using iCloud photo sync,
[02:49:59.400 --> 02:50:01.880]  and that's how your photos will get to your Mac.
[02:50:01.880 --> 02:50:04.540]  And a lot of consumer cameras have Wi-Fi now,
[02:50:04.540 --> 02:50:07.600]  and you can transfer photos that way.
[02:50:07.600 --> 02:50:09.520]  Right, so I think,
[02:50:11.800 --> 02:50:13.400]  I think you're right.
[02:50:13.400 --> 02:50:16.720]  This computer, you know, again, if this was real,
[02:50:16.720 --> 02:50:19.160]  it seems increasingly plausible.
[02:50:19.160 --> 02:50:19.980]  If this was real,
[02:50:19.980 --> 02:50:22.840]  I think this is a forward-looking computer,
[02:50:22.840 --> 02:50:26.080]  aggressively so, just like the first Air, as you said.
[02:50:26.080 --> 02:50:29.920]  They couldn't go, you know, basically portless.
[02:50:29.920 --> 02:50:32.840]  They couldn't go portless on the whole lineup yet,
[02:50:32.840 --> 02:50:35.520]  but they can have one weird outlier
[02:50:35.520 --> 02:50:37.400]  that is really good in some other way,
[02:50:37.400 --> 02:50:39.800]  most likely thinness and weight.
[02:50:39.800 --> 02:50:41.440]  They couldn't have this one crazy outlier
[02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:45.080]  that is awesome at this, like one aspect of itself,
[02:50:45.080 --> 02:50:46.680]  and gives up a lot to get there.
[02:50:47.840 --> 02:50:50.760]  I think it's true too, and let's, you know,
[02:50:50.760 --> 02:50:53.400]  Gurman's report, and I believe it,
[02:50:54.360 --> 02:50:56.060]  I mean, it could be details are off,
[02:50:56.060 --> 02:50:57.320]  but I mostly believe it,
[02:50:57.320 --> 02:50:59.040]  but he seems very sure about it,
[02:50:59.040 --> 02:51:00.680]  and I think he attributed the source
[02:51:00.680 --> 02:51:02.540]  to someone with an Apple who's used one,
[02:51:02.540 --> 02:51:05.500]  or at least, you know, like used the current prototype,
[02:51:05.500 --> 02:51:07.640]  and then the source told him everything about it,
[02:51:07.640 --> 02:51:09.240]  and then he gave that to an artist
[02:51:09.240 --> 02:51:10.680]  who made those renderings.
[02:51:12.280 --> 02:51:16.480]  So, you know, there's some pass it down the alleyway,
[02:51:16.480 --> 02:51:19.200]  you know, stuff that was probably not quite right
[02:51:19.200 --> 02:51:21.280]  in terms of, you know, the degree of tapering
[02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:22.620]  or some stuff like that,
[02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:25.680]  but it wasn't Gurman who said anything
[02:51:25.680 --> 02:51:27.000]  about what chip is in it, you know,
[02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.480]  whether it's this new M chip or anything like that.
[02:51:29.480 --> 02:51:32.140]  Gurman's report was just what the thing looks like.
[02:51:32.140 --> 02:51:33.920]  Right, and we don't, like,
[02:51:33.920 --> 02:51:36.620]  Intel did just release a Broadwell series chip
[02:51:36.620 --> 02:51:38.600]  that is fanless, or that can run fanless,
[02:51:38.600 --> 02:51:40.660]  that it just uses so little power
[02:51:40.660 --> 02:51:41.500]  that it can run fanless.
[02:51:41.500 --> 02:51:43.280]  Did Gurman say that it's fanless?
[02:51:43.280 --> 02:51:45.960]  No, see, I think everyone's guessing
[02:51:45.960 --> 02:51:47.280]  that it is probably fanless.
[02:51:47.280 --> 02:51:49.280]  I don't think he actually said it is,
[02:51:49.280 --> 02:51:53.280]  and, you know, the way CPU cooling works,
[02:51:53.280 --> 02:51:54.640]  you can, like, you know,
[02:51:54.640 --> 02:51:56.800]  all the current MacBooks have fans.
[02:51:56.800 --> 02:51:58.920]  Most of the time, most people won't hear them,
[02:51:58.920 --> 02:52:00.900]  especially the newer ones are even better.
[02:52:00.900 --> 02:52:01.740]  They're even quieter,
[02:52:01.740 --> 02:52:03.760]  but, the Retina series.
[02:52:03.760 --> 02:52:07.360]  But you can, like, you can have something
[02:52:07.360 --> 02:52:09.160]  that's totally fanless, like an iPad,
[02:52:09.160 --> 02:52:11.700]  and have it basically just use the chassis
[02:52:11.700 --> 02:52:13.420]  as a giant heat sink,
[02:52:13.420 --> 02:52:16.560]  and, you know, just basically radiate here,
[02:52:16.560 --> 02:52:17.600]  you know, through contact,
[02:52:17.600 --> 02:52:20.120]  like, radiate heat into the exterior shell,
[02:52:20.120 --> 02:52:21.640]  or some interior thing that, you know,
[02:52:21.640 --> 02:52:23.080]  touches the shell eventually.
[02:52:24.500 --> 02:52:26.040]  If you have a little heat sink,
[02:52:26.040 --> 02:52:29.320]  and you have any air moving it at all,
[02:52:29.320 --> 02:52:32.880]  even if you have the slowest, quietest fan
[02:52:32.880 --> 02:52:34.520]  that most people don't even realize is there,
[02:52:34.520 --> 02:52:36.160]  like the original Apple TV had a fan,
[02:52:36.160 --> 02:52:37.840]  I don't know if you even know that,
[02:52:37.840 --> 02:52:41.320]  even if you have the tiniest little fan in there,
[02:52:41.320 --> 02:52:44.800]  blowing the slowest speed it can possibly go,
[02:52:44.800 --> 02:52:46.720]  barely moving any air over it,
[02:52:46.720 --> 02:52:50.240]  that cools way better than any kind of passive cooling.
[02:52:50.240 --> 02:52:52.520]  Like, the slightest bit of air movement
[02:52:52.520 --> 02:52:54.480]  is substantially better,
[02:52:54.480 --> 02:52:57.440]  and you can dissipate a lot more heat that way, so.
[02:52:57.440 --> 02:52:59.880]  It reminds me of the world's tiniest violin
[02:52:59.880 --> 02:53:03.000]  playing the world's smallest fan,
[02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:06.000]  blowing the world's smallest amount of air.
[02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:07.600]  Yeah, like, it makes a huge difference,
[02:53:07.600 --> 02:53:09.640]  and that gives you a much higher thermal budget,
[02:53:09.640 --> 02:53:12.560]  and modern processors are pretty much all
[02:53:12.560 --> 02:53:14.220]  limited by their thermal budgets,
[02:53:14.220 --> 02:53:16.920]  like, their performance is gated by that factor.
[02:53:16.920 --> 02:53:20.080]  So, they don't have to use a fanless chip in this,
[02:53:20.080 --> 02:53:21.320]  if they don't want to.
[02:53:21.320 --> 02:53:24.080]  They still could, if they wanted to,
[02:53:24.080 --> 02:53:26.040]  I think they can fit a fan in there,
[02:53:26.040 --> 02:53:27.760]  I think they, like.
[02:53:27.760 --> 02:53:30.560]  Well, if the Surface has a fan,
[02:53:30.560 --> 02:53:31.920]  Surface Pro does, at least.
[02:53:31.920 --> 02:53:33.360]  Yeah, and it's really thin, right?
[02:53:33.360 --> 02:53:35.580]  It's, well, it's certainly thinner than,
[02:53:36.680 --> 02:53:39.160]  I think it's, I'm not quite as sure
[02:53:39.160 --> 02:53:41.000]  if it's as thin as this MacBook is,
[02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.040]  because the Surface thinness doesn't have,
[02:53:43.040 --> 02:53:44.480]  it doesn't have a hinge.
[02:53:44.480 --> 02:53:46.400]  Right, although, I think it has ports somewhere,
[02:53:46.400 --> 02:53:47.640]  so it probably isn't this thin,
[02:53:47.640 --> 02:53:48.640]  but it's probably in the ballpark,
[02:53:48.640 --> 02:53:52.400]  and so, yeah, like, I think they could put a fan in there
[02:53:52.400 --> 02:53:55.080]  if they wanted to, they could be using a CPU
[02:53:55.080 --> 02:53:58.520]  that has, that is like, the same class
[02:53:58.520 --> 02:54:00.140]  as the existing MacBook Air CPUs,
[02:54:00.140 --> 02:54:02.080]  of like, that class of performance.
[02:54:02.080 --> 02:54:03.960]  All right, so, Gurman's report does say,
[02:54:03.960 --> 02:54:06.780]  above the keyboard are four redesigned speaker grills
[02:54:06.780 --> 02:54:08.860]  that actually double as ventilation holes
[02:54:08.860 --> 02:54:11.200]  for the fanless device to keep cool.
[02:54:11.200 --> 02:54:14.640]  So, Gurman says it's fanless, but we shall see.
[02:54:18.640 --> 02:54:20.400]  I think you're right, I'm with you,
[02:54:20.400 --> 02:54:22.680]  and I think that these Verge guys
[02:54:22.680 --> 02:54:25.520]  are just misreading the whole thing,
[02:54:25.520 --> 02:54:29.940]  when they, they're saying that it's like a low-end device
[02:54:29.940 --> 02:54:31.840]  that will compete with Chromebooks.
[02:54:31.840 --> 02:54:33.160]  Not a chance.
[02:54:33.160 --> 02:54:35.360]  I think it's gonna be more expensive,
[02:54:35.360 --> 02:54:38.040]  and I think, therefore, just like when they introduced
[02:54:38.040 --> 02:54:41.080]  the Retina MacBook Pros, and they kept non-Retina ones
[02:54:41.080 --> 02:54:46.020]  around to anchor the low end of the pricing tier,
[02:54:46.020 --> 02:54:48.880]  I mean, you could still buy non-Retina MacBook Pros,
[02:54:48.880 --> 02:54:49.840]  you know, I think they started,
[02:54:49.840 --> 02:54:52.220]  I think they're only like 10, like 1,000 bucks,
[02:54:52.220 --> 02:54:53.400]  I think you can get like a 13-inch MacBook Pro.
[02:54:53.400 --> 02:54:56.080]  Yeah, I think there's one, like there's like one
[02:54:56.080 --> 02:54:58.080]  buried in the store that's like 1,100 bucks,
[02:54:58.080 --> 02:54:59.300]  they mentioned that on connected also.
[02:54:59.300 --> 02:55:01.480]  Yeah, so I think this will be more expensive
[02:55:01.480 --> 02:55:02.840]  than the current starting price
[02:55:02.840 --> 02:55:05.120]  for even the 13-inch MacBook Pro,
[02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:06.880]  and I don't think it'll be much more.
[02:55:06.880 --> 02:55:09.040]  I think it'll probably start at like,
[02:55:09.040 --> 02:55:11.920]  I don't know, 1,300 bucks, 1,400 bucks, maybe,
[02:55:14.080 --> 02:55:16.400]  and that they'll keep, I don't know if they'll keep
[02:55:16.400 --> 02:55:20.520]  both the 11 and 13, but they'll keep at least the 13 around
[02:55:20.520 --> 02:55:24.020]  at 8.99, or maybe even drop it to 7.99.
[02:55:25.440 --> 02:55:26.280]  Yeah, maybe, I don't know.
[02:55:26.280 --> 02:55:27.960]  For the foreseeable future.
[02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:29.640]  I do think it would be kind of weird
[02:55:29.640 --> 02:55:33.520]  if they had 11, 12, and 13 on sale at the same time.
[02:55:33.520 --> 02:55:36.480]  Just seems like too, that seems a little unappley.
[02:55:36.480 --> 02:55:38.800]  Seems like to me, like maybe the 11,
[02:55:38.800 --> 02:55:40.160]  you know, what's the point of the 11?
[02:55:40.160 --> 02:55:42.800]  Is it to be 11 inches, or is it to be the,
[02:55:42.800 --> 02:55:46.120]  even, you know, the super smallest and lightest?
[02:55:46.120 --> 02:55:47.700]  Well, I think that this 12-inch,
[02:55:47.700 --> 02:55:50.880]  which seems to have a footprint mostly like the 11,
[02:55:50.880 --> 02:55:54.200]  and width-wise is apparently the same width as the 11,
[02:55:54.200 --> 02:55:56.400]  and has a bigger screen, because it has a smaller bezel.
[02:55:56.400 --> 02:55:59.600]  I'd say there's no reason for the 11 to exist.
[02:55:59.600 --> 02:56:02.480]  Yeah, the 11 has such a wide bezel that it really has,
[02:56:02.480 --> 02:56:05.280]  it does not make good use of its size for the screen.
[02:56:05.280 --> 02:56:06.720]  You know, the keyboard makes good use of the size,
[02:56:06.720 --> 02:56:09.000]  the body, but like, the screen, like, you look at that,
[02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:10.440]  and you're like, man, I wish that bezel was thinner
[02:56:10.440 --> 02:56:11.600]  and the screen was bigger.
[02:56:11.600 --> 02:56:14.240]  I'm looking at it right now, and it just looks ridiculous.
[02:56:14.240 --> 02:56:15.520]  It looks outdated, no, it looks outdated.
[02:56:15.520 --> 02:56:17.840]  It looks like the laptops from when, you know,
[02:56:17.840 --> 02:56:20.960]  I was, you know, in college, and they, you know,
[02:56:20.960 --> 02:56:22.640]  were just like tiny little thing
[02:56:22.640 --> 02:56:24.140]  in the middle of a huge bezel,
[02:56:25.760 --> 02:56:27.720]  that they didn't even come close to taking up
[02:56:27.720 --> 02:56:29.800]  the full size of the display panel.
[02:56:29.800 --> 02:56:30.640]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:56:33.260 --> 02:56:35.680]  Yeah, I'm guessing this thing is real.
[02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:37.560]  I'm guessing it comes out in the next couple of months,
[02:56:37.560 --> 02:56:39.680]  like, soon, not June.
[02:56:39.680 --> 02:56:42.120]  I'm guessing this comes out, like, this winter.
[02:56:43.080 --> 02:56:44.600]  Possibly announced at the same event
[02:56:44.600 --> 02:56:46.920]  as the Apple Watch release date, I don't know.
[02:56:46.920 --> 02:56:50.200]  And possibly the iPad Maxi.
[02:56:50.200 --> 02:56:52.300]  I don't know, see, I'm still not entirely convinced
[02:56:52.300 --> 02:56:55.440]  that's a real thing, or that it's imminent, rather.
[02:56:55.440 --> 02:56:57.120]  I don't know, we'll see what happens.
[02:56:57.120 --> 02:56:59.100]  A lot of people, I've seen a lot of people,
[02:56:59.100 --> 02:57:01.320]  and I think it's just, you're not thinking this through.
[02:57:01.320 --> 02:57:03.020]  People thinking that, well, you know,
[02:57:03.020 --> 02:57:04.320]  remember the old jobs trick
[02:57:04.320 --> 02:57:06.080]  where there was the internet communicator,
[02:57:06.080 --> 02:57:09.680]  a phone, and a widescreen video iPad, you know.
[02:57:09.680 --> 02:57:11.700]  Not three products, it's one product.
[02:57:11.700 --> 02:57:15.880]  Well, there's a 12-inch MacBook, and a 12-inch iPad,
[02:57:15.880 --> 02:57:18.160]  and a MacBook, and guess what, it's one device,
[02:57:18.160 --> 02:57:21.600]  and it's an iPad, and it has a keyboard, and it's like, no.
[02:57:21.600 --> 02:57:24.000]  No, I definitely don't, and I even said,
[02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:25.960]  I even tweeted the other day,
[02:57:25.960 --> 02:57:30.200]  I've long suspected that the rumors are for one device,
[02:57:30.200 --> 02:57:31.480]  but I meant that in the sense
[02:57:31.480 --> 02:57:34.040]  that people are misinterpreting the rumors,
[02:57:34.040 --> 02:57:37.360]  not in the sense that this is a combined iPad and MacBook.
[02:57:37.360 --> 02:57:40.720]  Right, that Apple's out in Asia sourcing these 12-inch,
[02:57:40.720 --> 02:57:43.120]  right, and everyone thinks,
[02:57:43.120 --> 02:57:45.080]  oh, that must be for a bigger iPad,
[02:57:45.080 --> 02:57:47.880]  but no, maybe it's also just for a smaller MacBook.
[02:57:47.880 --> 02:57:50.560]  But a few people have told me
[02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:53.200]  that they have solid information from rumor sources,
[02:57:53.200 --> 02:57:55.200]  blah, blah, blah, that this really is two different devices
[02:57:55.200 --> 02:57:57.640]  that are really separate, so fine, it doesn't really matter.
[02:57:57.640 --> 02:58:00.600]  But I, yeah, I don't know,
[02:58:00.600 --> 02:58:03.800]  I can't possibly be less excited about a 12-inch iPad.
[02:58:03.800 --> 02:58:06.480]  No, even though that's what Syracuse wants.
[02:58:06.480 --> 02:58:07.440]  It is what Syracuse wants,
[02:58:07.440 --> 02:58:10.600]  but he also wants like Pro OS features to be added
[02:58:10.600 --> 02:58:13.840]  to make it better for multitasking and pro work,
[02:58:13.840 --> 02:58:16.440]  and I just, I don't see a good way
[02:58:16.440 --> 02:58:18.720]  for that to be bulleted onto iOS.
[02:58:18.720 --> 02:58:20.060]  It's not to say they're not gonna try.
[02:58:20.060 --> 02:58:21.600]  They might try, I don't know,
[02:58:21.600 --> 02:58:26.360]  but I think the MacBook Air
[02:58:26.360 --> 02:58:28.520]  and this new, quote, MacBook Stealth,
[02:58:28.520 --> 02:58:30.880]  whatever this new 12-inch thing is gonna be called,
[02:58:30.880 --> 02:58:35.200]  I think that is Apple's answer to pro-ultramobile computing.
[02:58:35.200 --> 02:58:36.920]  Like, it's the Mac, but smaller.
[02:58:36.920 --> 02:58:41.200]  It's not trying to bolt on a bunch of pro-multitasking
[02:58:41.200 --> 02:58:43.800]  power user features onto the iPad.
[02:58:45.360 --> 02:58:46.520]  I think, what do you,
[02:58:46.520 --> 02:58:48.640]  Germin doesn't say, the most curious thing to me
[02:58:48.640 --> 02:58:50.520]  is he doesn't mention retina display.
[02:58:50.520 --> 02:58:52.560]  Doesn't say it has one, doesn't say it doesn't have one,
[02:58:52.560 --> 02:58:54.320]  doesn't say, which to me is crazy.
[02:58:54.320 --> 02:58:56.120]  I think it has to have a retina display
[02:58:56.120 --> 02:58:58.940]  because I don't think you can introduce new products
[02:58:58.940 --> 02:59:01.700]  anymore, or at least Apple can't, that aren't.
[02:59:01.700 --> 02:59:03.960]  Like, there's never gonna be a non-retina watch.
[02:59:03.960 --> 02:59:05.640]  The watch starts retina.
[02:59:05.640 --> 02:59:06.480]  Right.
[02:59:06.480 --> 02:59:08.240]  Everything new is retina.
[02:59:08.240 --> 02:59:10.920]  Yeah, I think it would have to be, right?
[02:59:10.920 --> 02:59:11.760]  I mean-
[02:59:11.760 --> 02:59:12.740]  And then I think the name is obvious.
[02:59:12.740 --> 02:59:15.380]  You just call it the MacBook Air with Retina Display.
[02:59:15.380 --> 02:59:17.800]  And it does, you don't even have to say that it's 12.
[02:59:17.800 --> 02:59:18.640]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[02:59:18.640 --> 02:59:20.180]  MacBook Air with Retina Display.
[02:59:20.180 --> 02:59:22.940]  And now it's, they can use the Air name,
[02:59:22.940 --> 02:59:25.620]  which I think has great brand equity,
[02:59:25.620 --> 02:59:28.440]  and also make it very clear that it's the new thing,
[02:59:28.440 --> 02:59:30.160]  because it's the retina display.
[02:59:30.160 --> 02:59:32.660]  Just like the MacBook Pro with retina display.
[02:59:33.560 --> 02:59:36.060]  I think the rumor,
[02:59:36.060 --> 02:59:37.640]  I don't know if it was in German's report or someone else's,
[02:59:37.640 --> 02:59:39.240]  but the rumor that it might come in space gray
[02:59:39.240 --> 02:59:40.440]  is kind of exciting.
[02:59:40.440 --> 02:59:41.800]  Yeah, and gold.
[02:59:41.800 --> 02:59:42.720]  That's less exciting.
[02:59:42.720 --> 02:59:44.560]  But the space gray.
[02:59:44.560 --> 02:59:46.500]  Well, right, because I would definitely buy
[02:59:46.500 --> 02:59:47.960]  the space gray one.
[02:59:47.960 --> 02:59:49.140]  If it comes in space gray,
[02:59:49.140 --> 02:59:51.640]  that would be the first thing that puts
[02:59:51.640 --> 02:59:54.120]  a tinge of desire in my heart.
[02:59:54.120 --> 02:59:55.560]  Yeah, because I mean, I'll tell you,
[02:59:55.560 --> 02:59:58.640]  like the Mac Pro, the new cylinder Mac Pro,
[02:59:58.640 --> 03:00:00.640]  that looks awesome in person.
[03:00:00.640 --> 03:00:02.600]  Because that is basically a space gray color.
[03:00:02.600 --> 03:00:04.280]  I don't think it's exactly the same color as the phones,
[03:00:04.280 --> 03:00:06.720]  but it's very close, and it has a glossy finish.
[03:00:06.720 --> 03:00:09.000]  But it's in the ballpark.
[03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:10.800]  It looks so awesome in person.
[03:00:10.800 --> 03:00:12.760]  You just feel like a badass having that on your desk.
[03:00:12.760 --> 03:00:14.320]  It just looks fantastic.
[03:00:14.320 --> 03:00:19.320]  And I definitely think the bead blasted aluminum look
[03:00:19.680 --> 03:00:21.560]  that we've had in Apple products
[03:00:21.560 --> 03:00:23.700]  for my entire time using Apple products,
[03:00:24.580 --> 03:00:27.920]  I think that is in many ways a timeless look
[03:00:27.920 --> 03:00:29.400]  that will never go fully out of style.
[03:00:29.400 --> 03:00:32.160]  However, it'd be nice to see something a little bit new,
[03:00:32.160 --> 03:00:33.920]  a little bit fresh in that area if it's possible,
[03:00:33.920 --> 03:00:34.960]  and if it doesn't suck.
[03:00:34.960 --> 03:00:38.080]  So if they can make a space gray version,
[03:00:38.080 --> 03:00:40.080]  I think it would be a nice change of pace.
[03:00:40.080 --> 03:00:43.760]  Yeah, and wouldn't the white version be lighter?
[03:00:43.760 --> 03:00:48.760]  Like I don't have a white iPhone handy here.
[03:00:49.980 --> 03:00:53.340]  But I'm thinking that an upside down white iPhone
[03:00:53.340 --> 03:00:56.240]  is a lighter shade of aluminum than a MacBook.
[03:00:56.240 --> 03:00:57.240]  I don't think that's true.
[03:00:57.240 --> 03:00:58.160]  Maybe it's the same.
[03:00:58.160 --> 03:00:59.000]  Yeah, I think it's the same.
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:00:59.940]  But it would look different
[03:00:59.940 --> 03:01:02.440]  if they use white for the bezel though.
[03:01:02.440 --> 03:01:04.120]  Yeah, that is true.
[03:01:04.120 --> 03:01:05.360]  Assuming it has like the,
[03:01:05.360 --> 03:01:07.800]  cause like the current MacBook Airs have the metal bezel
[03:01:07.800 --> 03:01:09.160]  the way the old Apple Fuse do.
[03:01:09.160 --> 03:01:13.000]  If it adopts the like, you know, glass goes edge to edge
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.080]  and the bezel is like this black surround,
[03:01:15.080 --> 03:01:16.760]  or yeah, then it could be white, you're right.
[03:01:16.760 --> 03:01:18.040]  Yeah, but space gray would be cool.
[03:01:18.040 --> 03:01:22.380]  The most inexplicable thing that Gurman's renderings have,
[03:01:22.380 --> 03:01:23.600]  and I just don't get this,
[03:01:23.600 --> 03:01:25.620]  is why they have the power key
[03:01:25.620 --> 03:01:28.480]  where the escape key has been since forever.
[03:01:28.480 --> 03:01:29.520]  Oh, I hope that's wrong.
[03:01:29.520 --> 03:01:31.040]  I saw that too and I'm like,
[03:01:31.040 --> 03:01:33.120]  ooh, that's gonna be annoying.
[03:01:33.120 --> 03:01:35.240]  I can't help but think that that's just a mistake,
[03:01:35.240 --> 03:01:36.840]  you know, because it's their commissioning.
[03:01:36.840 --> 03:01:38.400]  But then again, wouldn't the mistake,
[03:01:38.400 --> 03:01:39.640]  wouldn't it be easier, you know,
[03:01:39.640 --> 03:01:43.800]  to just use a keyboard layout that you've already had?
[03:01:43.800 --> 03:01:46.760]  You know, it seems like it would be more work in Photoshop
[03:01:46.760 --> 03:01:48.920]  or whatever you use to build this to move that.
[03:01:48.920 --> 03:01:50.680]  Well, cause the, and the existing 11 inch
[03:01:50.680 --> 03:01:51.800]  fits it just fine.
[03:01:51.800 --> 03:01:54.800]  Like it puts it above a backspace, right?
[03:01:54.800 --> 03:01:56.640]  Well, by definition, it would,
[03:01:56.640 --> 03:01:58.240]  it could go on either side, right?
[03:01:58.240 --> 03:02:00.100]  You would just slide over all the other keys
[03:02:00.100 --> 03:02:02.160]  and put it in the top right where it's been forever.
[03:02:02.160 --> 03:02:04.120]  And it's not so much that I wanna hit that power key,
[03:02:04.120 --> 03:02:06.960]  but that I do use the escape key
[03:02:06.960 --> 03:02:08.920]  and I don't wanna put my MacBook to sleep
[03:02:08.920 --> 03:02:10.600]  when I just reach up there blindly
[03:02:10.600 --> 03:02:11.760]  and hit the top right key.
[03:02:11.760 --> 03:02:12.600]  You know what though?
[03:02:12.600 --> 03:02:13.920]  I just realized, you know,
[03:02:13.920 --> 03:02:15.000]  I think we are numbered here.
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.200]  I think most people hit backspace
[03:02:17.200 --> 03:02:19.440]  a heck of a lot more often than they hit escape.
[03:02:19.440 --> 03:02:20.280]  Oh, and then maybe that's why they move it.
[03:02:20.280 --> 03:02:23.060]  That's plausible, oh man.
[03:02:23.060 --> 03:02:24.660]  Oh, so the explanation, maybe,
[03:02:24.660 --> 03:02:26.660]  and then they'll move it on all the keyboards.
[03:02:26.660 --> 03:02:28.480]  Yeah, because, you know, already,
[03:02:28.480 --> 03:02:29.720]  like you can't just tap it.
[03:02:29.720 --> 03:02:31.800]  Like you have to like hold it down for a second.
[03:02:31.800 --> 03:02:33.280]  Yeah, I've never thought of that.
[03:02:33.280 --> 03:02:35.160]  But yeah, like when you're looking at a keyboard,
[03:02:35.160 --> 03:02:36.640]  you're looking at where it is in the 11 inch now,
[03:02:36.640 --> 03:02:38.840]  it's above backspace, or delete rather, sorry.
[03:02:38.840 --> 03:02:39.680]  I have a Microsoft keyboard.
[03:02:39.680 --> 03:02:42.200]  That's the first logical explanation I've heard about that.
[03:02:42.200 --> 03:02:43.120]  Yeah, that's- I've thought about that.
[03:02:43.120 --> 03:02:43.960]  I guess I thought about that now,
[03:02:43.960 --> 03:02:44.960]  but that's unfortunate,
[03:02:44.960 --> 03:02:48.040]  because that sounds extremely plausible and reasonable,
[03:02:48.040 --> 03:02:50.080]  even though it would suck for people like us.
[03:02:50.080 --> 03:02:53.680]  Somebody on Twitter said that they're a Vim user
[03:02:53.680 --> 03:02:56.680]  and they can't believe Apple would do that.
[03:02:56.680 --> 03:02:59.160]  You know, escape key is too important to Vim users.
[03:02:59.160 --> 03:03:00.000]  And it's like-
[03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:02.800]  Yup, I'm a Vim user when I'm on server stuff.
[03:03:02.800 --> 03:03:06.400]  And it's also autocomplete and textmate, like, oh man.
[03:03:06.400 --> 03:03:08.840]  Well, it's autocomplete system-wide, isn't it?
[03:03:08.840 --> 03:03:09.960]  Is it? I don't know.
[03:03:09.960 --> 03:03:10.960]  F5 is too.
[03:03:10.960 --> 03:03:12.460]  I've only ever tried it in textmate.
[03:03:12.460 --> 03:03:15.720]  But yeah, but I think now that I think about
[03:03:15.720 --> 03:03:17.720]  the power button being above backspace instead,
[03:03:17.720 --> 03:03:19.160]  I think that's very plausible.
[03:03:19.160 --> 03:03:20.760]  Yeah, ooh, I never thought of that.
[03:03:20.760 --> 03:03:21.660]  Oh, we're screwed.
[03:03:23.200 --> 03:03:24.360]  Well, let's keep the show short.
[03:03:24.360 --> 03:03:25.200]  Let's wrap it up.
[03:03:25.200 --> 03:03:27.800]  You're always very good at keeping the show short.
[03:03:27.800 --> 03:03:31.260]  I am, I am very good in the last 30 seconds
[03:03:31.260 --> 03:03:33.360]  of keeping the show short.
[03:03:33.360 --> 03:03:35.640]  Marco Arment, thank you, thank you for the time
[03:03:35.640 --> 03:03:39.460]  and a lot of good conversation tonight.
[03:03:39.460 --> 03:03:43.400]  People can find out more at your suddenly very popular
[03:03:43.400 --> 03:03:45.240]  website, marco.org.
[03:03:45.240 --> 03:03:46.080]  That's right.
[03:03:46.080 --> 03:03:49.920]  And your Twitter is at Marco Arment.
[03:03:49.920 --> 03:03:51.960]  My goal is to lose as many people as possible
[03:03:51.960 --> 03:03:53.680]  from my audience by blogging about really boring
[03:03:53.680 --> 03:03:55.520]  developer stuff for a while.
[03:03:55.520 --> 03:03:57.600]  And of course, we gotta mention ATP.
[03:03:57.600 --> 03:04:00.080]  Anybody, I can't, there's gotta be so much overlap.
[03:04:00.080 --> 03:04:02.880]  But if you're out there and you like it when Marco's
[03:04:02.880 --> 03:04:05.520]  on the talk show, you gotta listen to ATP.
[03:04:05.520 --> 03:04:08.560]  It's my favorite podcast and I say that
[03:04:10.480 --> 03:04:11.520]  completely honestly.
[03:04:11.520 --> 03:04:16.520]  So ATP is at ATP.fm.
[03:04:16.560 --> 03:04:19.200]  Six characters for including the dot.
[03:04:19.200 --> 03:04:20.040]  So that's pretty good.
[03:04:20.040 --> 03:04:21.120]  Yeah, FM is pretty wide open because it costs
[03:04:21.120 --> 03:04:22.600]  like 70 bucks a year to register.
[03:04:22.600 --> 03:04:25.240]  So it's pretty easy to still get pretty good stuff there.
[03:04:25.240 --> 03:04:28.640]  Yeah, and it works with the podcast angle.
[03:04:28.640 --> 03:04:29.480]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:04:30.800 --> 03:04:35.480]  So check those three things out and wait for Marco
[03:04:35.480 --> 03:04:37.280]  to burn the internet down next week.
[03:04:39.600 --> 03:04:40.840]  All right, thank you, thank you.
[03:04:40.840 --> 03:04:41.680]  Thank you.
[03:04:41.680 --> 03:04:43.160]  It was so great.
[03:04:43.160 --> 03:04:45.560]  I love it now that I've just given up on keeping shows
[03:04:45.560 --> 03:04:46.820]  a reasonable length.
[03:04:46.820 --> 03:04:47.660]  Oh yeah.
[03:04:47.660 --> 03:04:55.660]  Let's get through it.
