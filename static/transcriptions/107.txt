[00:00.000 --> 00:01.480]  What kind of microphone do you have?
[00:01.480 --> 00:03.480]  I know you were gonna give me like a,
[00:03.480 --> 00:06.600]  how to improve my audio some help a while ago
[00:06.600 --> 00:07.560]  and then we never follow it through.
[00:07.560 --> 00:09.120]  What kind of mic do you have?
[00:09.120 --> 00:12.600]  So I have both of the ones that everyone says
[00:12.600 --> 00:14.320]  are the best mics for this purpose.
[00:14.320 --> 00:16.720]  I have the high LPR-40, the Dan Benjamin
[00:16.720 --> 00:18.120]  and all those people use,
[00:18.120 --> 00:20.560]  and I have the sure SM7B.
[00:20.560 --> 00:21.840]  And I prefer the sure.
[00:21.840 --> 00:23.320]  I prefer the way my voice sounds at the share.
[00:23.320 --> 00:26.480]  The high LPR-40 makes people sign a little bit more nasal
[00:26.480 --> 00:28.800]  and has like weird, it's like,
[00:28.800 --> 00:30.680]  it's missing like the mid bass,
[00:30.680 --> 00:32.760]  but it has a lot of the lower bass.
[00:32.760 --> 00:34.200]  So you sound like really bassy,
[00:34.200 --> 00:38.240]  but not that present and not that warm with the PR-40.
[00:38.240 --> 00:42.440]  So the SM7B is a really, really nice soundy mic,
[00:42.440 --> 00:44.360]  probably the best sounding mic for this purpose,
[00:44.360 --> 00:46.520]  but has the giant asterisk that it needs
[00:46.520 --> 00:49.080]  a really nice and generally very expensive
[00:49.080 --> 00:51.160]  preamp to power it properly.
[00:51.160 --> 00:52.160]  Yeah, screw that.
[00:55.040 --> 00:56.440]  That's what I use, of course.
[00:56.440 --> 00:58.720]  Now I've got the old road podcaster,
[00:58.720 --> 01:01.640]  which is probably, I guess I can do better.
[01:02.520 --> 01:05.600]  You could, I mean, there's a question on how much it matters.
[01:05.600 --> 01:09.200]  Because your show has guests that rotate out every week,
[01:09.200 --> 01:11.920]  like you don't want to sound that different from the guests.
[01:11.920 --> 01:13.720]  Now there have been a lot of episodes of your show
[01:13.720 --> 01:15.600]  where I think you sound worse than the guests,
[01:15.600 --> 01:18.760]  but that might be because of like weird EQ going on
[01:18.760 --> 01:20.160]  or something else going on,
[01:20.160 --> 01:21.880]  that might be something else in the process
[01:21.880 --> 01:24.520]  being not that great, I don't know.
[01:24.520 --> 01:28.480]  The other thing was how do you talk into your mic?
[01:28.480 --> 01:31.000]  I keep the mic underneath my face.
[01:31.000 --> 01:34.240]  Like I'm not, it's sticking straight up
[01:34.240 --> 01:36.240]  and it's close to my mouth,
[01:36.240 --> 01:39.400]  but I have it where it's underneath my face.
[01:39.400 --> 01:42.240]  It's more or less like at my chin and going down.
[01:42.240 --> 01:43.400]  Yeah, you're doing it wrong.
[01:43.400 --> 01:46.640]  Yeah, you're supposed to be like staring right into it, right?
[01:46.640 --> 01:47.480]  Yeah, pretty much.
[01:47.480 --> 01:50.040]  Like my, and like, yeah, like so for mine,
[01:50.040 --> 01:53.600]  like because I have the crazy low output SM7B,
[01:53.600 --> 01:56.120]  I am like, my lips are almost touching the pop filter.
[01:56.120 --> 01:58.040]  Sometimes they do touch the pop filter.
[01:58.040 --> 01:59.240]  I'm like right on top of it,
[01:59.240 --> 02:00.880]  talking directly straight on into it.
[02:02.280 --> 02:03.120]  Yeah, see what happened?
[02:03.120 --> 02:05.440]  I'm asking all these questions because I came in,
[02:05.440 --> 02:07.200]  I spent a big chunk of the holidays
[02:07.200 --> 02:08.920]  not working in my home office.
[02:08.920 --> 02:10.240]  Was downstairs, you know,
[02:10.240 --> 02:11.840]  and they're dining room, you know,
[02:11.840 --> 02:14.760]  being more of a, you know, part of the family.
[02:14.760 --> 02:21.760]  And I came up to record the Star Wars episode of the show
[02:26.080 --> 02:28.960]  with Syracuse and Guy.
[02:28.960 --> 02:29.800]  That was good.
[02:29.800 --> 02:30.800]  By the way, I thought I would hate that
[02:30.800 --> 02:31.720]  because it was so long.
[02:31.720 --> 02:33.320]  I don't care that much about Star Wars,
[02:33.320 --> 02:34.400]  but that was actually really good.
[02:34.400 --> 02:35.240]  I really enjoyed it.
[02:35.240 --> 02:37.040]  Those are the compliments from people who said,
[02:37.040 --> 02:38.240]  I don't even like Star Wars,
[02:38.240 --> 02:40.040]  but I like that show that to me was,
[02:40.040 --> 02:41.000]  that's all that matters.
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.920]  That meant that it came out the way I wanted it to.
[02:43.920 --> 02:46.120]  I came up to my office and the mic,
[02:46.120 --> 02:48.880]  my mic arm was on the ground in front of my desk.
[02:48.880 --> 02:51.800]  And I thought, I knew I didn't put it there.
[02:51.800 --> 02:54.120]  And Amy records her show up here.
[02:54.120 --> 02:57.240]  And I didn't think she'd recorded an episode recently,
[02:57.240 --> 02:58.640]  but I thought it must have been her.
[02:58.640 --> 03:00.360]  And I was like, why in the world would she disconnect it
[03:00.360 --> 03:02.960]  from the desk and put it on the floor?
[03:02.960 --> 03:04.120]  And I was a little annoyed.
[03:04.120 --> 03:05.760]  And then I looked and it was the fact
[03:05.760 --> 03:07.720]  that the arm mount had broken.
[03:07.720 --> 03:09.960]  It's just like, just right where you would think,
[03:09.960 --> 03:12.320]  right where the clamp goes on the desk,
[03:12.320 --> 03:16.040]  just like a stress fracture, which kind of makes sense
[03:16.040 --> 03:18.920]  because it's, you know, supports a fair amount of weight.
[03:18.920 --> 03:21.600]  And it's the same arm that I had had ever since I started
[03:21.600 --> 03:23.400]  doing the first run of the show,
[03:23.400 --> 03:25.120]  which I think was like 2007.
[03:25.120 --> 03:26.720]  I don't even know when that was.
[03:26.720 --> 03:31.440]  So, but anyway, I had to get a new podcast arm.
[03:31.440 --> 03:33.560]  And of course, I didn't set it up until right
[03:33.560 --> 03:35.440]  when we were supposed to record tonight.
[03:35.440 --> 03:36.280]  Naturally.
[03:36.280 --> 03:37.640]  And I'm looking at the instructions
[03:37.640 --> 03:39.240]  and it's like, wow, they're showing me
[03:39.240 --> 03:41.400]  to set this mic up in a very different way
[03:41.400 --> 03:44.560]  than I have ever, ever used the microphone.
[03:46.120 --> 03:47.200]  Yeah, no, you're definitely doing it wrong.
[03:47.200 --> 03:49.400]  I mean, certain mics are made to be addressed
[03:49.400 --> 03:52.840]  like on the side, but that's not one of them.
[03:52.840 --> 03:54.280]  Yeah, but I'm not talking into the side.
[03:54.280 --> 03:56.160]  I am talking into the top of it.
[03:56.160 --> 03:58.080]  Well, you're kind of talking like over the top of it.
[03:58.080 --> 03:58.920]  Like you'd play a thing.
[03:58.920 --> 04:01.080]  Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.
[04:01.080 --> 04:02.080]  Yeah, that's not good.
[04:03.120 --> 04:05.240]  I don't know, maybe I could try to fix it right now.
[04:05.240 --> 04:06.680]  It seems to me that if I do it their way,
[04:06.680 --> 04:08.320]  I'm gonna, it's what I'm gonna be seeing.
[04:08.320 --> 04:10.920]  I won't be able to see like my computer or anything.
[04:10.920 --> 04:12.560]  Yeah, you kind of got to like look through them
[04:12.560 --> 04:16.120]  like through the arm and kind of look, you know,
[04:16.120 --> 04:18.040]  I mean, yeah, I don't know.
[04:19.560 --> 04:21.760]  Maybe I'll put it in an angle or something.
[04:21.760 --> 04:23.760]  Does this sound any better?
[04:23.760 --> 04:25.360]  Yeah, it's not a little bit loud or a little bit clearer.
[04:25.360 --> 04:27.200]  I mean, it's not a huge difference,
[04:27.200 --> 04:29.240]  but it's a little different.
[04:29.240 --> 04:31.400]  All right, if you see here a terrible noise,
[04:31.400 --> 04:33.640]  it means that I've unscrewed this thing.
[04:33.640 --> 04:37.560]  I mean, the road podcaster is not an amazing mic.
[04:37.560 --> 04:38.880]  Like you're not gonna, you're never gonna
[04:38.880 --> 04:42.800]  sound amazing from it, but you can sound good enough from it.
[04:42.800 --> 04:44.360]  Yeah, I can't get the things screwed on to it.
[04:44.360 --> 04:46.040]  All right, well, shit.
[04:47.320 --> 04:49.360]  This will make for excellent audio.
[04:50.840 --> 04:51.880]  What a broadcast.
[04:53.080 --> 04:56.120]  All right, now it's all floppy.
[04:58.960 --> 05:00.600]  These things are ridiculous.
[05:01.640 --> 05:03.760]  Also, the road boom arm that I assume you're using.
[05:03.760 --> 05:05.000]  I'm also using one.
[05:05.000 --> 05:05.920]  It's not the best arm.
[05:05.920 --> 05:07.800]  I mean, it's pretty shitty.
[05:07.800 --> 05:12.800]  It works, but like mine, like any slight vibration,
[05:12.960 --> 05:14.640]  anywhere, like in the desk or anything,
[05:14.640 --> 05:17.320]  a spring inside the arm rattles,
[05:17.320 --> 05:19.240]  which is completely the opposite of the kind of thing
[05:19.240 --> 05:21.920]  it's supposed to do, and it's just like,
[05:21.920 --> 05:26.280]  I haven't ever replaced it because it's not broken yet.
[05:26.280 --> 05:28.080]  It still works, but.
[05:28.080 --> 05:30.000]  I even had the thought when I had the rework,
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.200]  when I had the order one, I just went to Amazon
[05:32.200 --> 05:33.600]  and I saw that it said road,
[05:33.600 --> 05:34.720]  and I thought, well, I've got a road mic,
[05:34.720 --> 05:35.560]  might as well get it.
[05:35.560 --> 05:36.880]  Yeah.
[05:36.880 --> 05:38.560]  And the old one was a highl.
[05:38.560 --> 05:39.440]  Is that how you pronounce it?
[05:39.440 --> 05:40.280]  Yeah.
[05:40.280 --> 05:41.600]  Well, that's how other people pronounce it.
[05:41.600 --> 05:42.440]  I don't know.
[05:44.120 --> 05:46.560]  And even though, like I said, it was seven years old,
[05:46.560 --> 05:47.400]  and I sort of don't,
[05:47.400 --> 05:48.720]  I'm not really angry that it broke.
[05:48.720 --> 05:50.200]  I still feel like, well, it broke.
[05:50.200 --> 05:51.440]  I'm not gonna buy another highl.
[05:51.440 --> 05:52.280]  Right.
[05:53.480 --> 05:54.520]  So I just bought the road.
[05:54.520 --> 05:55.360]  But then I had this,
[05:55.360 --> 05:56.720]  and it was one of those things where I,
[05:56.720 --> 05:58.920]  you know, Amazon makes it so easy.
[05:58.920 --> 06:00.440]  So it's like, that's my thought process.
[06:00.440 --> 06:03.120]  My thought process was not a highl.
[06:04.440 --> 06:06.240]  I already have a road mic
[06:06.240 --> 06:08.320]  and it looked highly rated on Amazon.
[06:08.320 --> 06:10.920]  And so like two clicks later, it was on its way.
[06:10.920 --> 06:13.120]  And so then with a little bit of thought,
[06:13.120 --> 06:16.240]  I thought, maybe I should have taken the usual advice
[06:16.240 --> 06:17.240]  and asked Marco.
[06:17.240 --> 06:19.000]  No, I mean, that's what I'm,
[06:19.000 --> 06:20.040]  I'm using the exact same arm,
[06:20.040 --> 06:20.880]  like the road, you know,
[06:20.880 --> 06:22.160]  PS whatever arm,
[06:22.160 --> 06:24.200]  it's, they're only arm, I think.
[06:24.200 --> 06:25.400]  I'm using the same one.
[06:25.400 --> 06:26.480]  Just because I had the podcast,
[06:26.480 --> 06:28.760]  or like I bought the kit for five by five,
[06:28.760 --> 06:30.400]  and then I upgraded my mic,
[06:30.400 --> 06:33.000]  but never upgraded the boom arm because it still works.
[06:33.000 --> 06:35.080]  The desk lamp does look sturdier than the highl.
[06:35.080 --> 06:37.320]  Like the highl, after having looked at it,
[06:37.320 --> 06:38.400]  it's like I'm kind of surprised
[06:38.400 --> 06:40.920]  it didn't snap off right away.
[06:40.920 --> 06:42.640]  Yeah, I mean, like I don't really know where the road
[06:42.640 --> 06:44.120]  one would break.
[06:44.120 --> 06:45.720]  Like looking at the construction, like, you know,
[06:45.720 --> 06:48.280]  what, I don't know what part of this would be the weak point,
[06:48.280 --> 06:51.320]  but I don't think, I mean, I think it's more likely
[06:51.320 --> 06:53.640]  that like one of the springs in the armored snap
[06:53.640 --> 06:56.040]  and would lose tension and just drop to the desk.
[06:56.040 --> 06:58.160]  Yeah, I think that would be more likely to fail.
[06:58.160 --> 06:59.760]  Yeah, and that actually was starting to happen
[06:59.760 --> 07:02.880]  with my highl that I was starting to lose some tension.
[07:02.880 --> 07:05.200]  And I could not, there's no way to like adjust that.
[07:06.280 --> 07:09.640]  Yeah, the road to these weird screws on the arm,
[07:09.640 --> 07:11.320]  but I don't know if that was doing anything.
[07:11.320 --> 07:12.160]  Yeah.
[07:12.160 --> 07:13.760]  What are these velcro straps for?
[07:13.760 --> 07:16.360]  Those are for attaching the cable,
[07:16.360 --> 07:19.240]  like you basically attach the cable to the arm
[07:19.240 --> 07:21.040]  on its way down using those.
[07:22.520 --> 07:24.120]  So that way you can have like a nice tidy cable
[07:24.120 --> 07:26.080]  going down to the base of the arm.
[07:26.080 --> 07:27.880]  Oh, that would be nice.
[07:27.880 --> 07:29.600]  Yeah, that's what they're for.
[07:29.600 --> 07:30.920]  All right, anyway.
[07:30.920 --> 07:32.680]  Yeah, I'll take a picture of my side of you.
[07:32.680 --> 07:33.960]  Why it week for you?
[07:33.960 --> 07:34.800]  Yeah.
[07:36.120 --> 07:37.920]  Yeah, nothing's got nothing's ever going on.
[07:37.920 --> 07:42.920]  It's for the record we're recording on Thursday the eighth,
[07:43.920 --> 07:47.120]  which is a night after you recorded ATP
[07:47.120 --> 07:48.720]  where I presume you talked about probably
[07:48.720 --> 07:50.280]  all the same things we're going to talk about tonight,
[07:50.280 --> 07:52.880]  but I couldn't have listened to it yet
[07:52.880 --> 07:55.320]  because I didn't catch the live broadcast.
[07:56.360 --> 07:57.720]  But people like you, they won't mind here
[07:57.720 --> 07:59.000]  and you talk about it twice.
[07:59.000 --> 08:00.320]  Yeah, they should be all right.
[08:00.320 --> 08:04.320]  When did you publish your piece Sunday?
[08:04.320 --> 08:05.480]  Yeah, it was Sunday night.
[08:05.480 --> 08:08.840]  At part of the problem, I think was that I published it
[08:10.280 --> 08:13.240]  on a Sunday night right before a,
[08:13.240 --> 08:16.320]  right as a holiday vacation for a lot of people was ending
[08:16.320 --> 08:18.960]  and there's nothing going on in the news.
[08:18.960 --> 08:19.800]  Right.
[08:19.800 --> 08:22.120]  And so a lot of the places that picked it up,
[08:22.120 --> 08:23.640]  a lot of people were telling me like,
[08:23.640 --> 08:25.640]  yeah, never published things like at that time
[08:25.640 --> 08:28.960]  because like people are so desperate for news
[08:28.960 --> 08:31.200]  at some of these bigger sites that like,
[08:31.200 --> 08:33.560]  you know, there's nothing going on in tech on, you know,
[08:33.560 --> 08:35.280]  on a random Monday.
[08:35.280 --> 08:36.360]  I mean, CES was starting,
[08:36.360 --> 08:40.040]  but nothing had really been announced of any meaning yet.
[08:40.040 --> 08:43.360]  And so it was saying like,
[08:43.360 --> 08:45.520]  I couldn't have possibly had worse timing
[08:45.520 --> 08:47.760]  if I didn't want it to be that noticed.
[08:47.760 --> 08:51.280]  Like if you would publish the exact same piece word for word,
[08:51.280 --> 08:54.520]  not changed one bit, but maybe on Wednesday,
[08:54.520 --> 08:56.840]  it might have, it might have, you know,
[08:56.840 --> 09:00.160]  I think it would have gotten the attention it deserved,
[09:00.160 --> 09:03.280]  but it wouldn't have gotten the attention it didn't deserve.
[09:03.280 --> 09:05.360]  I don't know how even had to put it.
[09:05.360 --> 09:06.440]  Yeah, that's basically it.
[09:06.440 --> 09:08.760]  I mean, like it, I mean,
[09:08.760 --> 09:10.880]  honestly, it didn't deserve the attention to God.
[09:10.880 --> 09:12.600]  That's for sure.
[09:12.600 --> 09:13.440]  It wasn't good.
[09:13.440 --> 09:15.480]  Like that's the regret I have about it
[09:15.480 --> 09:16.720]  is that just wasn't very good.
[09:16.720 --> 09:19.680]  Like it was nowhere near my best work.
[09:19.680 --> 09:23.200]  It was, it was just, I didn't put enough effort into it.
[09:23.200 --> 09:25.280]  I made a bunch of little mistakes in it.
[09:25.280 --> 09:26.680]  And it just wasn't very good.
[09:26.680 --> 09:30.320]  And then for that to become extremely widespread
[09:30.320 --> 09:34.600]  and to have it be under quite a bit of scrutiny,
[09:34.600 --> 09:36.800]  that is just frustrating.
[09:36.800 --> 09:40.000]  Yeah. So for the record, I mean, I'm sure people listening
[09:40.000 --> 09:41.720]  extemporaneously, like, you know,
[09:41.720 --> 09:43.560]  people who are listening when this episode first comes out
[09:43.560 --> 09:44.880]  will know exactly what we're talking about.
[09:44.880 --> 09:47.240]  But for the record, we should say what it was,
[09:47.240 --> 09:50.200]  which is that on Sunday you published an article titled
[09:50.200 --> 09:54.560]  Headline Apple has lost the functional high ground.
[09:54.560 --> 09:59.520]  And I think if, if I may at nutshell summary is you've
[09:59.520 --> 10:01.520]  detected that over the last few years,
[10:01.520 --> 10:05.880]  the quality of Apple's software has gotten worse.
[10:05.880 --> 10:06.720]  Correct.
[10:06.720 --> 10:09.560]  Not any one particular thing, just in general.
[10:09.560 --> 10:13.680]  And that it concerns you about the future of the company.
[10:13.680 --> 10:15.600]  And it's the reason you switched to the Mac
[10:15.600 --> 10:17.320]  in the first place a decade ago is that you
[10:17.320 --> 10:21.040]  are sick of having little stupid things like little annoying
[10:21.040 --> 10:25.160]  bugs here, there, everywhere all day long,
[10:25.160 --> 10:27.600]  that it just works factor is sort of fading
[10:27.600 --> 10:29.920]  from Apple's software platforms.
[10:29.920 --> 10:33.840]  Right. And a lot of the pushback,
[10:33.840 --> 10:37.840]  I mean, the reason it spread so quickly, so incredibly quickly.
[10:37.840 --> 10:40.840]  I mean, it had hundreds of retweets within a few hours
[10:40.840 --> 10:44.440]  in publishing it, and then it spread from there.
[10:44.440 --> 10:47.280]  The reason it spread, I think, is because a lot of people
[10:47.280 --> 10:48.800]  agree.
[10:48.800 --> 10:51.200]  And a lot of people still argued with it, of course.
[10:51.200 --> 10:55.120]  But I think if I was totally wrong, it wouldn't have spread.
[10:55.120 --> 10:58.040]  It's not like I'm publishing this on some major news site
[10:58.040 --> 11:00.280]  where people like you would make fun of me if I got it wrong.
[11:00.280 --> 11:02.320]  Like, I'm publishing this on my personal site.
[11:02.320 --> 11:05.400]  Like, it's not widely read most of the time.
[11:05.400 --> 11:08.480]  And so, I don't think it would have spread
[11:08.480 --> 11:10.920]  if there wasn't some truth there.
[11:10.920 --> 11:13.360]  Yeah, I think the word I used, and I saw a couple of other
[11:13.360 --> 11:13.960]  people use it.
[11:13.960 --> 11:16.080]  I know how can Barry did too, and I think it's because it's
[11:16.080 --> 11:18.280]  the perfect word that it resonated.
[11:18.280 --> 11:20.320]  Right, or it hit a nerve, one of those.
[11:20.320 --> 11:22.720]  I think resonated is better.
[11:22.720 --> 11:24.600]  Yeah, probably.
[11:24.600 --> 11:26.200]  I don't think that's why you're the pro-writer.
[11:26.200 --> 11:26.880]  I don't know.
[11:26.880 --> 11:30.040]  There's to me, resonated is exactly what happened.
[11:30.040 --> 11:34.680]  It's like it felt true more so than thought true.
[11:34.680 --> 11:35.680]  It just felt right.
[11:35.680 --> 11:38.120]  Right, and very few people have said,
[11:38.120 --> 11:39.800]  you are completely wrong.
[11:39.800 --> 11:42.760]  Most people have just said, well, I would have said it
[11:42.760 --> 11:45.440]  differently, or it isn't as severe as you say, and so,
[11:45.440 --> 11:50.840]  and that's what I regret, where I felt my failing was that
[11:50.840 --> 11:53.880]  I worded some things too severely, and which, of course,
[11:53.880 --> 11:57.960]  is a frequent problem I have, so I worded some things too
[11:57.960 --> 12:02.960]  severely, and that detracted from the validity of what I wrote.
[12:02.960 --> 12:08.120]  But the fact is, I think the overall sentiment of Apple's
[12:08.120 --> 12:10.600]  software has some quality problems in recent years, and it
[12:10.600 --> 12:14.200]  doesn't seem to be getting better, that I think is what
[12:14.200 --> 12:16.520]  resonated with people pretty unambiguously.
[12:16.520 --> 12:21.400]  Yeah, you have a sort of, it's almost like a no-nonsense
[12:21.400 --> 12:24.280]  style, and I'll vouch for it.
[12:24.280 --> 12:25.760]  You certainly aren't doing it.
[12:25.760 --> 12:26.920]  You're not sensational.
[12:26.920 --> 12:30.480]  You don't overstate things for sensational purposes,
[12:30.480 --> 12:33.120]  because you're not looking for hits or page views,
[12:33.120 --> 12:35.920]  because you don't even have, you know, you use the deck.
[12:35.920 --> 12:37.800]  You don't even get paid by page views.
[12:37.800 --> 12:39.600]  You're not going to get extra this month
[12:39.600 --> 12:42.720]  because you had an explosive story this week that got a couple
[12:42.720 --> 12:43.840]  hundred thousand extra page views.
[12:43.840 --> 12:44.880]  It doesn't give you a nickel.
[12:44.880 --> 12:47.440]  Right, in fact, it could actually cost me money if I end up
[12:47.440 --> 12:49.920]  going over some bandwidth allocations at my house.
[12:49.920 --> 12:52.160]  Right, the more popular and article is it actually might
[12:52.160 --> 12:53.360]  cost me more money.
[12:53.360 --> 12:55.040]  That's funny, it's actually true, right?
[12:55.040 --> 13:00.480]  Which is the opposite of when, you know, when Dan Lyons
[13:00.480 --> 13:03.600]  trumps up something at ValleyWag, it's because, you know,
[13:03.600 --> 13:07.080]  they measure their success month by page views.
[13:07.080 --> 13:08.160]  You're not in that game.
[13:08.160 --> 13:11.200]  You know, that's not the way that you overstated it.
[13:11.200 --> 13:13.840]  It's just sort of a no nonsense style.
[13:13.840 --> 13:16.600]  Well, but, you know, and you're right,
[13:16.600 --> 13:18.440]  that that's what I intended.
[13:18.440 --> 13:22.600]  But because I did use like so, like one of these examples,
[13:22.600 --> 13:25.560]  like I originally said quality has taken a nose dive.
[13:25.560 --> 13:27.120]  And that was the wrong word, really.
[13:27.120 --> 13:28.280]  It hasn't taken a nose dive.
[13:28.280 --> 13:29.960]  It's been a gradual decline.
[13:29.960 --> 13:32.480]  And what I meant really was a decline that's just now
[13:32.480 --> 13:33.560]  in really bad shape.
[13:33.560 --> 13:36.720]  But a nose dive suggests like an acceleration
[13:36.720 --> 13:39.520]  of like all of a sudden it's now dropping quickly.
[13:39.520 --> 13:40.520]  And that's not really the case.
[13:40.520 --> 13:42.200]  It's more of a gradual progression.
[13:42.200 --> 13:45.840]  But anyway, so like, you know, there are things like that.
[13:45.840 --> 13:48.920]  And yeah, overall, like I regret having written it simply
[13:48.920 --> 13:54.600]  because it put some of my most mediocre to worst work
[13:54.600 --> 13:58.120]  in front of so many people and put my name on it forever.
[13:58.120 --> 14:02.840]  Whereas like, I don't regret having said that Apple has problems.
[14:02.840 --> 14:05.240]  I guess regret that I didn't say it better.
[14:05.240 --> 14:05.800]  Right.
[14:05.800 --> 14:08.800]  And what happened then is that it really went explosive.
[14:08.800 --> 14:09.800]  I mean, like you know,
[14:09.800 --> 14:11.960]  you even said, I guess it was your Google Analytics,
[14:11.960 --> 14:14.880]  but whatever, you, you know, you had your analytics showed
[14:14.880 --> 14:16.960]  that it was more popular than anything
[14:16.960 --> 14:18.640]  you had written in all of 2014.
[14:18.640 --> 14:19.440]  Correct.
[14:19.440 --> 14:22.520]  Which is amazing really that, you know, five days
[14:22.520 --> 14:24.600]  into the year you've already topped last year.
[14:24.600 --> 14:25.520]  It just got picked up.
[14:25.520 --> 14:28.760]  It got picked up and relanked and relanked and relanked.
[14:28.760 --> 14:31.400]  And I guess business insider got it started.
[14:31.400 --> 14:33.000]  Here's their headline.
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.240]  Apple's software is in a quote nose dive end quote
[14:37.240 --> 14:40.080]  that is deeply concerning long time Apple's supporters
[14:40.080 --> 14:45.240]  says that's a narrow writing a perfect business insider headline.
[14:45.240 --> 14:45.600]  Right.
[14:45.600 --> 14:48.840]  And the thing is like, usually I could pick on business insider
[14:48.840 --> 14:51.240]  and say, you guys are such pieces of shit for this
[14:51.240 --> 14:52.720]  because usually they are.
[14:52.720 --> 14:55.760]  In this case, they really, the original version had a couple
[14:55.760 --> 14:59.960]  of like, of paraphrases and that were not what I said,
[14:59.960 --> 15:01.600]  that were more inflammatory.
[15:01.600 --> 15:03.520]  But he, he, I since complained about them
[15:03.520 --> 15:05.880]  and he updated them to be more accurate.
[15:05.880 --> 15:10.000]  So over and the headline like, I did say that, you know,
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.400]  as I said, I didn't really mean to say that severely,
[15:12.400 --> 15:13.560]  but I did say that.
[15:13.560 --> 15:16.960]  So overall of all the hat jobs they've done to me
[15:16.960 --> 15:19.280]  over the years, this is one of the better ones.
[15:20.440 --> 15:22.360]  Yeah, but it's, I guess it's not, yeah,
[15:22.360 --> 15:24.240]  it's not necessarily that as it stands right now
[15:24.240 --> 15:28.760]  that it's unfair, but it's, you know, fuel to the fire.
[15:28.760 --> 15:29.600]  Right.
[15:29.600 --> 15:32.480]  And actually in a lot of people don't realize this.
[15:32.480 --> 15:37.480]  A lot of people have no clue how insanely popular
[15:38.160 --> 15:40.400]  and pervasive business insider is.
[15:41.320 --> 15:43.520]  Like whenever, whenever I mentioned
[15:43.520 --> 15:48.040]  on business insider any context, I will have everybody
[15:48.040 --> 15:52.280]  who was ever met me, my mom's friends, my, my friends,
[15:52.280 --> 15:56.280]  parents, like people who are outside of, of the tech news
[15:56.280 --> 16:00.920]  sphere, they will all contact me and be like, oh my God,
[16:00.920 --> 16:02.800]  I read this article about you on business insider,
[16:02.800 --> 16:04.960]  you know, congratulations, or like they consider it a good
[16:04.960 --> 16:06.240]  thing whenever I mentioned they're even though it's
[16:06.240 --> 16:07.400]  always a trashy.
[16:09.800 --> 16:11.720]  Like sometimes like one of my products will occasionally
[16:11.720 --> 16:14.280]  get mentioned in some major tech publication, like, you know,
[16:14.280 --> 16:17.360]  Mac world or occasionally I've even been like in New York
[16:17.360 --> 16:20.000]  times or Wall Street Journal or something like that,
[16:20.000 --> 16:21.840]  never a peep from anybody.
[16:21.840 --> 16:25.240]  When I'm a business insider for the stupidest smallest thing,
[16:25.240 --> 16:27.520]  everyone in my life comes forward, oh my God,
[16:27.520 --> 16:29.840]  I haven't seen you in 15 years, but I read this article
[16:29.840 --> 16:31.640]  about you in business insider.
[16:31.640 --> 16:34.560]  That site, like, I don't know why it's so popular,
[16:34.560 --> 16:37.000]  but it is really popular.
[16:37.000 --> 16:39.760]  And so whenever they write anything about me
[16:39.760 --> 16:43.680]  or one of my, one of my products, it gets picked up everywhere,
[16:43.680 --> 16:46.880]  it gets carried everywhere, and they ultimately dictate
[16:46.880 --> 16:47.720]  the narrative.
[16:47.720 --> 16:50.160]  If you look like almost every other site
[16:50.160 --> 16:52.920]  that republished this article was republishing
[16:52.920 --> 16:54.040]  from business insider.
[16:54.040 --> 16:55.960]  A lot of them were linking back to business insider
[16:55.960 --> 16:57.000]  instead of my site.
[16:57.000 --> 16:59.120]  A lot of them were taking the business insider headlines
[16:59.120 --> 17:00.760]  and quotes word for word.
[17:00.760 --> 17:05.800]  It really was business insider that led the promotion
[17:05.800 --> 17:07.680]  on this, whether you're willingly or not,
[17:07.680 --> 17:08.800]  and I don't know, it doesn't really matter,
[17:08.800 --> 17:12.840]  but people do not realize like your site
[17:12.840 --> 17:14.400]  seeds all the tech sites.
[17:14.400 --> 17:16.160]  Like whenever you write about something,
[17:16.160 --> 17:18.000]  all the tech sites write about it a day later.
[17:18.000 --> 17:20.560]  Business insider seeds everything else.
[17:20.560 --> 17:23.480]  It's really weird, and I wish it wasn't that way,
[17:23.480 --> 17:24.800]  but it really is.
[17:24.800 --> 17:28.040]  It's sort of the opposite of my sort of popularity.
[17:28.040 --> 17:30.080]  My popularity is super niche.
[17:30.080 --> 17:33.040]  And so like it is a big deal for some people,
[17:33.040 --> 17:34.200]  like if I link to somebody,
[17:34.200 --> 17:36.320]  first time I ever linked to their blog,
[17:36.320 --> 17:38.200]  a lot of people will like tweet to me like,
[17:38.200 --> 17:39.560]  oh my God, you just made my day.
[17:39.560 --> 17:42.800]  And it's, that's hard for me.
[17:42.800 --> 17:44.400]  I don't, I'm still not yet.
[17:44.400 --> 17:45.760]  I can't say I'll ever get used to that,
[17:45.760 --> 17:47.520]  but I understand it.
[17:47.520 --> 17:49.200]  I know, I know what was like,
[17:49.200 --> 17:51.160]  I know what it was like the first time
[17:51.160 --> 17:52.960]  that slash dot linked to Darren Fireball
[17:52.960 --> 17:55.720]  way back in 2002, and it was just crazy.
[17:55.720 --> 17:57.400]  And it's not even that I loved slash dot,
[17:57.400 --> 18:00.080]  but it's like I knew that holy shit, that's a big deal.
[18:00.080 --> 18:00.920]  Right.
[18:00.920 --> 18:03.240]  It was like getting on the dig front page back in 2006.
[18:03.240 --> 18:04.080]  Right.
[18:04.080 --> 18:05.520]  I also remember that my site didn't go down.
[18:05.520 --> 18:07.600]  And it was, you know, I thought,
[18:07.600 --> 18:09.040]  you know, I had up until that point,
[18:09.040 --> 18:11.600]  I had no idea whether, you know,
[18:11.600 --> 18:12.920]  there was no way for me to fake it.
[18:12.920 --> 18:15.960]  I couldn't, you know, know if I would survive a slash dotting.
[18:17.840 --> 18:21.000]  But I don't think it, it like,
[18:21.000 --> 18:22.840]  some guy, you know, somebody writes a blog post,
[18:22.840 --> 18:24.480]  I've never linked to them before I link to them.
[18:24.480 --> 18:25.920]  They're not going to get their mom calling them
[18:25.920 --> 18:28.760]  and say, hey, I heard saw Darren Fireball linked to you.
[18:28.760 --> 18:31.160]  Because her mom doesn't know who I am either.
[18:31.160 --> 18:32.840]  Unless the mom is really cool.
[18:32.840 --> 18:34.880]  Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, it would be an exception.
[18:34.880 --> 18:36.040]  It would have to be like, you know,
[18:36.040 --> 18:38.560]  like Brent Simmons were his mom's like a programmer and stuff.
[18:38.560 --> 18:39.400]  Right.
[18:39.400 --> 18:40.400]  And, you know, I shouldn't even say mom,
[18:40.400 --> 18:43.080]  you know, mom, dad, anybody who's not in the thing
[18:43.080 --> 18:44.680]  and is already one of my regular readers,
[18:44.680 --> 18:46.240]  whereas business insider has a very,
[18:46.240 --> 18:49.440]  for whatever reason, has a very broad readership,
[18:49.440 --> 18:51.440]  like of typical people.
[18:51.440 --> 18:53.640]  Yeah, what they write goes very far,
[18:53.640 --> 18:56.720]  which is really unfortunate because it's so bad usually.
[18:56.720 --> 18:58.480]  Yeah, it's something to do with, you know,
[18:58.480 --> 19:00.480]  that they're a certain brand of,
[19:01.480 --> 19:03.480]  I don't know, sensationalizing stuff.
[19:03.480 --> 19:04.840]  Well, look, I mean, you know,
[19:04.840 --> 19:07.960]  there are things in the world that, like,
[19:07.960 --> 19:09.760]  there are choices people can make,
[19:09.760 --> 19:12.760]  where you can do things like the good,
[19:12.760 --> 19:15.880]  high quality, morally sound way.
[19:15.880 --> 19:18.600]  Or, oh, you take this one little shortcut here
[19:18.600 --> 19:21.000]  if you're willing to give up a little bit of integrity here,
[19:21.000 --> 19:22.480]  a little bit of sensationalism here.
[19:22.480 --> 19:25.880]  You can boost your numbers by 15, 20, 30%.
[19:25.880 --> 19:29.120]  And they choose the latter all the time,
[19:29.120 --> 19:31.920]  like, so like, whereas you choose the former
[19:31.920 --> 19:33.560]  and that's what we consider in our community
[19:33.560 --> 19:36.240]  to be like the right way to do it.
[19:36.240 --> 19:38.280]  If you're shameless enough,
[19:39.240 --> 19:43.480]  and if you prioritize numbers and success of the in that kind
[19:43.480 --> 19:46.480]  over integrity and quality,
[19:46.480 --> 19:50.080]  then you can get insane numbers and insane popularity
[19:50.080 --> 19:52.080]  and they have chosen that.
[19:52.080 --> 19:53.960]  Yeah, and let's not overstate things here either.
[19:53.960 --> 19:55.440]  They're certainly not the worst.
[19:55.440 --> 19:57.120]  They're, you know, and the other thing too,
[19:57.120 --> 19:58.400]  they have talented people
[19:58.400 --> 19:59.960]  and they have had talented people.
[19:59.960 --> 20:01.440]  Dan Fomer used to write there.
[20:01.440 --> 20:02.760]  Yeah, that's where I met him, I used to hate him.
[20:02.760 --> 20:04.280]  And then like he came to the Tumblr offices,
[20:04.280 --> 20:05.480]  I met him there first,
[20:05.480 --> 20:08.800]  and then like he left and became a normal, good person.
[20:08.800 --> 20:09.880]  It was amazing.
[20:09.880 --> 20:13.040]  And I know Jay Arrow who wrote this piece on you,
[20:13.040 --> 20:15.480]  you know, he's good, he's smart, you know?
[20:15.480 --> 20:17.000]  You could just tell from like,
[20:17.000 --> 20:17.840]  reading something.
[20:17.840 --> 20:19.160]  He's some tutor.
[20:19.160 --> 20:21.080]  Nick Carlson, who I think is his name,
[20:21.080 --> 20:23.800]  the guy who just wrote the published the book on Yahoo
[20:23.800 --> 20:26.080]  and Marissa Meyer, you know, he's a good reporter.
[20:26.080 --> 20:29.080]  And he is, I'll give him that, you know.
[20:29.080 --> 20:30.400]  And I think it's interesting too.
[20:30.400 --> 20:33.520]  I think the success he's having promoting his book,
[20:33.520 --> 20:35.840]  because it seems, I'm reading a lot of stuff about his book.
[20:35.840 --> 20:37.720]  It's just popping up a lot of places.
[20:37.720 --> 20:39.720]  I think it just goes to show that business insider
[20:39.720 --> 20:43.200]  they're good at promoting stuff, including themselves.
[20:43.200 --> 20:44.080]  You know, like that's part,
[20:44.080 --> 20:45.280]  it's not just that they're,
[20:45.280 --> 20:47.640]  whether you're good bad or whatever as a writer,
[20:47.640 --> 20:52.040]  or a reporter, being able to self promote is a skill.
[20:52.040 --> 20:53.760]  And that, to me, is part of their,
[20:53.760 --> 20:55.360]  a big part of their success.
[20:55.360 --> 20:57.240]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[20:57.240 --> 20:59.280]  You know, and Henry Bloggitz always had that too,
[20:59.280 --> 21:01.000]  founder of the site.
[21:01.000 --> 21:02.840]  Right, among some other issues, but that's fine.
[21:02.840 --> 21:03.680]  Right.
[21:03.680 --> 21:07.720]  But that's a definite thing though, you know?
[21:07.720 --> 21:09.640]  It's like there's, there's certain people, you know,
[21:09.640 --> 21:12.320]  like he's good at getting on TV, you know?
[21:12.320 --> 21:14.720]  And there's that certain type of Wall Street person
[21:14.720 --> 21:18.640]  who is like just goes on CNBC all the time.
[21:18.640 --> 21:19.840]  And it would drive me nuts.
[21:19.840 --> 21:21.560]  I would hate going on TV.
[21:21.560 --> 21:24.560]  I would, I wouldn't think I'd want to go on once.
[21:24.560 --> 21:26.680]  I can't imagine like the, the amount of stress
[21:26.680 --> 21:29.840]  that would bring, I would, I would definitely,
[21:29.840 --> 21:32.440]  if I was ever invited, I would definitely decline.
[21:32.440 --> 21:34.040]  I've had invitations many times.
[21:34.040 --> 21:36.080]  And I almost, I mean, I, I went on Charlie Rose
[21:36.080 --> 21:37.280]  that one time and that was cool.
[21:37.280 --> 21:39.680]  And it was also pretty easy because it was like five
[21:39.680 --> 21:42.600]  in the afternoon, getting to New York at five
[21:42.600 --> 21:43.760]  in the afternoon is super easy.
[21:43.760 --> 21:46.160]  I just take like a one o'clock train from Philly
[21:46.160 --> 21:48.040]  and I like going to Manhattan anyway.
[21:48.040 --> 21:48.880]  So that was cool.
[21:48.880 --> 21:52.320]  And that was, I had a blast and it was well worth, you know,
[21:52.320 --> 21:54.880]  it wasn't that much of a time commitment.
[21:56.240 --> 21:58.680]  But like I've had offers to go on like Bloomberg TV.
[21:58.680 --> 22:00.760]  And it's like, you know, they want me in New York
[22:00.760 --> 22:03.360]  by like 5 a.m. Eastern.
[22:03.360 --> 22:05.480]  And it's like, no, it's not gonna work.
[22:05.480 --> 22:08.480]  And it, but it really doesn't compute with them
[22:08.480 --> 22:10.640]  that somebody would not want to be on TV.
[22:10.640 --> 22:14.920]  Like people who are in TV seem to be people who've,
[22:14.920 --> 22:16.680]  whether they're on the air or not,
[22:16.680 --> 22:18.200]  like, or whether they're just working
[22:18.200 --> 22:20.000]  as like a producer or whatever.
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.520]  It seems like the TV industry is only composed
[22:22.520 --> 22:24.280]  of people who've spent their whole lives wanting
[22:24.280 --> 22:26.000]  to be in the TV industry.
[22:26.000 --> 22:28.000]  And they can't, it just doesn't compute.
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.160]  It doesn't, they, they can't grasp it.
[22:30.160 --> 22:31.960]  And I say, you know, I, I really don't think
[22:31.960 --> 22:33.040]  I ever want to be on your show.
[22:33.040 --> 22:33.880]  Thanks for asking.
[22:33.880 --> 22:37.160]  I'm flattered, but you know, being in New York by 5 a.m.
[22:37.160 --> 22:39.120]  It's not, it's not gonna work.
[22:39.120 --> 22:41.720]  Well, also like, it's, it's similar to the,
[22:41.720 --> 22:43.320]  to the whole like, you know, you should do this
[22:43.320 --> 22:44.800]  for exposure kind of arguments.
[22:44.800 --> 22:46.960]  Like a lot of times they, they don't,
[22:46.960 --> 22:49.200]  they can't imagine why anybody would say no
[22:49.200 --> 22:51.520]  to this great honor that they're bestowing upon you.
[22:51.520 --> 22:53.640]  And, and the fact is like there's a cost to you
[22:53.640 --> 22:56.960]  being on TV and there's risks to you being on TV.
[22:56.960 --> 22:58.840]  And it, it just might not be worth it.
[22:58.840 --> 23:01.160]  Like that's how like, you know, I'm realizing
[23:01.160 --> 23:04.360]  as I'm, as I'm getting older and hopefully wiser
[23:04.360 --> 23:06.360]  but I keep making the same mistakes over and over again.
[23:06.360 --> 23:08.640]  So probably not wiser, but at least get older,
[23:08.640 --> 23:11.760]  I'm realizing that like talking to journalists
[23:11.760 --> 23:14.080]  for interviews, for stories about, you know, anything.
[23:14.080 --> 23:16.680]  Like when they call you for a quote or anything,
[23:16.680 --> 23:20.240]  like it is almost never worth agreeing to that
[23:20.240 --> 23:23.720]  because the risk is so high that they're going to distort
[23:23.720 --> 23:26.680]  your words to fit their narrative in a way that
[23:26.680 --> 23:28.760]  you don't approve of that, that you can't,
[23:28.760 --> 23:29.920]  that's totally out of your control.
[23:29.920 --> 23:31.640]  And it's like, in this day and age,
[23:31.640 --> 23:34.800]  like if I have something to say, I can say it on my blog.
[23:34.800 --> 23:36.360]  Now granted, now that has the other problem
[23:36.360 --> 23:37.520]  which just happened, which is like,
[23:37.520 --> 23:40.040]  I better be sure I say it well there
[23:40.040 --> 23:42.320]  and everything I write there can be taken
[23:42.320 --> 23:44.960]  and quoted elsewhere, but at least I wrote it my way.
[23:44.960 --> 23:48.320]  Like it seems like less of a risk to do it that way
[23:48.320 --> 23:51.080]  than like, to just be quoted in some random news story
[23:51.080 --> 23:53.880]  and like, you have no control over that.
[23:53.880 --> 23:56.480]  You, you usually, unless you have a very strong relationship
[23:56.480 --> 23:58.360]  with them, usually you can't get like review,
[23:58.360 --> 24:00.840]  like quote review or anything.
[24:00.840 --> 24:02.640]  And if somebody screws up and publishes something
[24:02.640 --> 24:03.560]  that you didn't quite say,
[24:03.560 --> 24:05.000]  there's pretty much something you can do about it.
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.480]  You know, that even if they publish a correction,
[24:07.480 --> 24:08.480]  the damage is done.
[24:08.480 --> 24:09.320]  Yeah.
[24:09.320 --> 24:12.120]  So it's like, and going on TV is probably even worse
[24:12.120 --> 24:13.760]  because like, you're live.
[24:13.760 --> 24:16.200]  Like you can't even carefully think about your words
[24:16.200 --> 24:17.560]  for very long, like your live.
[24:17.560 --> 24:19.560]  You need to get a comment right now
[24:19.560 --> 24:20.560]  and try to sound smart.
[24:20.560 --> 24:24.520]  And it just, and everyone's watching.
[24:24.520 --> 24:25.360]  You know.
[24:25.360 --> 24:27.160]  And it's also, it's not leisurely.
[24:27.160 --> 24:28.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.560]  I think I, it's funny, I was gonna say,
[24:31.560 --> 24:33.400]  I think I did pretty well on Charlie Rose
[24:33.400 --> 24:36.280]  but they've never asked me back so maybe not.
[24:36.280 --> 24:37.480]  I remember, I think I watched it.
[24:37.480 --> 24:38.920]  I remember just like, you know,
[24:38.920 --> 24:40.440]  I think I immediately forgot about it
[24:40.440 --> 24:42.080]  so it couldn't have been good or bad, really.
[24:42.080 --> 24:47.080]  It was me and David Pogue talking about the iPhone five?
[24:47.600 --> 24:50.760]  I want to say like, I'm gonna place it two years ago.
[24:50.760 --> 24:52.320]  Pretty sure it was iPhone five.
[24:52.320 --> 24:53.160]  I don't think it was.
[24:53.160 --> 24:55.160]  You probably did exactly what is like
[24:55.160 --> 24:57.600]  the optimal scenario for a TV appearance like that
[24:57.600 --> 25:01.280]  which is be good but completely forgettable
[25:01.280 --> 25:03.120]  because we all forgot it.
[25:03.120 --> 25:05.080]  And that's, that's good because like,
[25:05.080 --> 25:06.560]  it could go a lot worse.
[25:06.560 --> 25:08.440]  It can't really go much better.
[25:08.440 --> 25:10.920]  And so like that's, that's, and then,
[25:10.920 --> 25:13.360]  and now you can say I've been on the Charlie Rose show.
[25:13.360 --> 25:15.880]  You can tell your parents, they can see it like,
[25:15.880 --> 25:16.720]  it's all good.
[25:16.720 --> 25:20.120]  So you have all the benefits but nothing went wrong.
[25:20.120 --> 25:24.320]  Sitting in a chair that was warmed by Matt Damon's ass.
[25:24.320 --> 25:25.120]  Is that an honor?
[25:25.120 --> 25:26.120]  I'm not sure.
[25:26.120 --> 25:27.000]  I don't know, it's pretty cool
[25:27.000 --> 25:28.920]  they'll walk in into a room as he walks out.
[25:30.560 --> 25:33.760]  Did you stop saying, hey, I look, I look, you're sight man.
[25:33.760 --> 25:36.080]  Yeah, yeah, he was, he was, he wanted a t-shirt.
[25:36.080 --> 25:37.040]  Sure, he's a reader.
[25:37.040 --> 25:39.280]  No, I learned what to do in that scenario
[25:39.280 --> 25:42.000]  from, from Merlin man.
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.200]  It's such great advice that you just have to,
[25:44.200 --> 25:45.840]  you have to know this before,
[25:45.840 --> 25:47.720]  just think about it now before when there's no famous
[25:47.720 --> 25:48.560]  people around it.
[25:48.560 --> 25:51.800]  And if you ever meet somebody who's famous, truly famous
[25:51.800 --> 25:53.600]  and you're going to get a chance to say something.
[25:53.600 --> 25:56.520]  All you say is huge fan of your work.
[25:57.440 --> 25:58.280]  Oh, that's good.
[25:58.280 --> 25:59.120]  It's good.
[25:59.120 --> 26:01.200]  You just say huge fan of your work and you mean it.
[26:01.200 --> 26:02.400]  You know, don't say it if you don't mean it.
[26:02.400 --> 26:04.280]  Just look at him and say, hey, great to me,
[26:04.280 --> 26:06.440]  a huge, huge fan of your work.
[26:06.440 --> 26:08.080]  And then that's it, you just, and then you let him go.
[26:08.080 --> 26:09.800]  You just, you did maybe, maybe neither.
[26:09.800 --> 26:12.720]  I think with Damon, we didn't even stop walking.
[26:12.720 --> 26:14.280]  But it was, you know, there was a moment.
[26:14.280 --> 26:15.120]  I could say something.
[26:15.120 --> 26:17.400]  I just said, hey, huge fan of your work.
[26:17.400 --> 26:18.320]  And he goes, thanks.
[26:18.320 --> 26:20.880]  And then he left.
[26:20.880 --> 26:22.320]  See, and you had that story too.
[26:22.320 --> 26:23.480]  So it worked out.
[26:23.480 --> 26:24.320]  All right.
[26:27.240 --> 26:29.560]  Yeah, and anyway, what you said is exactly right though
[26:29.560 --> 26:31.280]  by talking to reporters where,
[26:31.280 --> 26:32.640]  and it's definitely my experience,
[26:32.640 --> 26:35.720]  where almost all of them have the story written,
[26:35.720 --> 26:37.160]  whether it's actually written, written,
[26:37.160 --> 26:39.920]  or it's just like an outline in their head.
[26:39.920 --> 26:41.080]  They've already got it written,
[26:41.080 --> 26:43.320]  and they will take your quote and make it fit
[26:43.320 --> 26:45.720]  what they've already written nine times out of 10.
[26:45.720 --> 26:47.520]  So I don't talk to reporters anymore either,
[26:47.520 --> 26:49.600]  unless I know them, and as I know,
[26:49.600 --> 26:50.520]  either know them personally,
[26:50.520 --> 26:54.200]  or if I'm familiar with their work and trust them.
[26:54.200 --> 26:56.200]  Yeah, and you know, it's different when you know them
[26:56.200 --> 26:58.560]  personally, you know, and I, yeah, I'll talk to people I know,
[26:58.560 --> 27:01.480]  but that's a pretty small list, really.
[27:01.480 --> 27:02.720]  Yeah.
[27:02.720 --> 27:04.560]  Or just, you know, just familiar with their work.
[27:04.560 --> 27:08.040]  But yeah, again, but Joe Shmo from Bloomberg, no way.
[27:08.040 --> 27:09.880]  Not a terrible idea.
[27:09.880 --> 27:12.640]  You can only go badly, and it probably will.
[27:12.640 --> 27:13.480]  Right.
[27:14.680 --> 27:16.160]  I almost worked there.
[27:16.160 --> 27:17.000]  At Bloomberg?
[27:17.000 --> 27:17.840]  Yeah.
[27:17.840 --> 27:20.800]  When I was interviewing for what became the Tumblr job,
[27:20.800 --> 27:22.600]  that was I was weighing those two offers.
[27:22.600 --> 27:23.920]  I got an offer from both.
[27:23.920 --> 27:27.200]  I interviewed both places, and I got the shoes
[27:27.200 --> 27:30.200]  between Bloomberg and this giant glass building
[27:30.200 --> 27:32.640]  where all the walls inside were a glass,
[27:32.640 --> 27:34.360]  and this caused problems because you couldn't see
[27:34.360 --> 27:36.040]  how to exit the conference room you were in.
[27:37.000 --> 27:38.320]  It's like optical illusions everywhere,
[27:38.320 --> 27:43.480]  and they told me they had to add this like row of stickers
[27:43.480 --> 27:45.160]  that were like, just like the company logo.
[27:45.160 --> 27:47.080]  There's a row of decals on every wall
[27:47.080 --> 27:49.040]  that at approximately eye level,
[27:49.040 --> 27:51.000]  just so you wouldn't like run into things,
[27:51.000 --> 27:51.960]  like run into walls.
[27:51.960 --> 27:55.040]  It's a typical corporate design of like,
[27:55.040 --> 27:57.400]  it looks really cool, it doesn't work at all.
[27:57.400 --> 28:01.160]  And so I got to weigh that of crashing into glass walls
[28:01.160 --> 28:04.360]  and sitting in a very long table
[28:04.360 --> 28:08.640]  with about four feet of width of the table assigned to me.
[28:08.640 --> 28:11.320]  Little six inch rim around the desk,
[28:11.320 --> 28:13.360]  like not even cubicle watch like a six inch rim
[28:13.360 --> 28:15.360]  around my little four foot space,
[28:15.360 --> 28:19.440]  typing on a PC working on four trend code.
[28:19.440 --> 28:20.280]  No.
[28:20.280 --> 28:21.120]  Yeah.
[28:21.120 --> 28:22.280]  Yeah, that was the job.
[28:22.280 --> 28:23.120]  Really?
[28:23.120 --> 28:27.040]  And everyone I interviewed with was not that nice.
[28:27.040 --> 28:29.240]  And I thought I bombed the interview.
[28:29.240 --> 28:32.240]  And so like I got an offer for an interview
[28:32.240 --> 28:33.640]  that I thought I bombed.
[28:33.640 --> 28:35.880]  For people I don't really want to work with
[28:35.880 --> 28:37.600]  in this terrible environment,
[28:37.600 --> 28:39.800]  like this giant like boiler room kind of environment,
[28:39.800 --> 28:41.320]  just like this little strip of a desk
[28:41.320 --> 28:43.040]  with a four trend terminal.
[28:43.040 --> 28:47.600]  Or I could go work for this guy who looks like he's 15,
[28:47.600 --> 28:50.800]  David Carp, and he's working out of some office.
[28:50.800 --> 28:52.600]  I don't quite understand that a bunch of other people
[28:52.600 --> 28:54.200]  are in, but he doesn't work for them.
[28:54.200 --> 28:55.920]  There's some arrangement where they're sharing the office
[28:55.920 --> 28:56.760]  or something.
[28:56.760 --> 28:57.640]  Everything is red and colorful
[28:57.640 --> 28:59.760]  on the office full of children's toys.
[28:59.760 --> 29:02.200]  And he told me that he'd buy me a Mac
[29:02.200 --> 29:04.520]  and I could work on a Mac.
[29:04.520 --> 29:05.600]  So I went with that.
[29:05.600 --> 29:08.560]  That was literally like why I wasn't there.
[29:08.560 --> 29:10.280]  I can't believe they've still got four trend code
[29:10.280 --> 29:11.200]  in production.
[29:11.200 --> 29:12.640]  I mean, that was literally on,
[29:12.640 --> 29:15.080]  I think it was this week's Simpsons.
[29:15.080 --> 29:17.320]  No, I actually, I was recently,
[29:17.320 --> 29:18.680]  I was on a flight recently,
[29:18.680 --> 29:21.560]  sitting next to a guy who works for IBM.
[29:21.560 --> 29:22.440]  And he was a young guy.
[29:22.440 --> 29:24.520]  He was, it was probably mid-20s.
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.680]  And so, but he works on an IBM's mainframe division,
[29:28.680 --> 29:30.000]  which is still running.
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.240]  And there's like, you know, big banks and insurance companies
[29:32.240 --> 29:35.240]  and things like they still use IBM mainframes.
[29:35.240 --> 29:37.480]  And he writes all in four trend,
[29:37.480 --> 29:39.640]  or no, I think it was cobalt, one of those two.
[29:39.640 --> 29:41.560]  He, like that's what he does all day,
[29:41.560 --> 29:45.200]  is right low level, mainframe operating system code
[29:45.200 --> 29:47.320]  in cobalt or four trend.
[29:47.320 --> 29:48.240]  Yeah, that's crazy.
[29:48.240 --> 29:49.800]  In this, and he's, I mean,
[29:49.800 --> 29:51.560]  he wasn't even born when this thing was,
[29:51.560 --> 29:53.400]  was originally written.
[29:53.400 --> 29:54.760]  I feel bad, because there's probably people
[29:54.760 --> 29:56.880]  who listen to the show who have a job like that.
[29:56.880 --> 29:58.720]  Oh, I'm sure it's more common than you think.
[29:58.720 --> 30:00.040]  That's the crazy part.
[30:00.040 --> 30:01.440]  Yeah, I don't really want to make fun.
[30:01.440 --> 30:02.560]  I'm not trying to make fun.
[30:02.560 --> 30:05.240]  I'm just sort of stunned that there's that much,
[30:08.440 --> 30:09.280]  what would you call it?
[30:09.280 --> 30:11.800]  Like inertia with the programming languages,
[30:11.800 --> 30:14.320]  that they just, once they get any kind of mass success,
[30:14.320 --> 30:16.040]  they just never die.
[30:16.040 --> 30:16.960]  Well, in a system like that,
[30:16.960 --> 30:18.400]  I mean, if you think about it, like,
[30:18.400 --> 30:22.160]  from like a programmer out of college viewpoint,
[30:22.160 --> 30:24.600]  and you think, why are you using four trend
[30:24.600 --> 30:27.040]  for your bank's large systems that you're stupid?
[30:27.040 --> 30:27.880]  That's dumb.
[30:27.880 --> 30:31.440]  I want to rewrite this whole thing in Node or whatever.
[30:31.440 --> 30:33.080]  And then, you know, but the reality is like,
[30:33.080 --> 30:35.000]  the wise programmer would look in that and be like,
[30:35.000 --> 30:38.840]  all right, this bank's massive financial backend
[30:38.840 --> 30:41.000]  that has been running fine for the most part
[30:41.000 --> 30:44.960]  for like 30 years, is written in some crazy language.
[30:44.960 --> 30:48.080]  Do I want the job of rewriting it from scratch?
[30:48.080 --> 30:48.920]  Hell no.
[30:48.920 --> 30:52.040]  Like, that has red flags all over it.
[30:52.040 --> 30:54.080]  You do not want that kind of responsibility.
[30:54.080 --> 30:55.000]  Get out of there.
[30:55.000 --> 30:58.320]  Like, I don't know, I don't know any wise programmers
[30:58.320 --> 30:59.880]  who would take that job.
[30:59.880 --> 31:01.560]  It's instead of if it ain't broke,
[31:01.560 --> 31:04.440]  don't fix it, if it ain't broke, don't rewrite it.
[31:04.440 --> 31:05.640]  And certainly don't touch it
[31:05.640 --> 31:08.080]  when there's like massive amounts of money at stake.
[31:09.200 --> 31:10.680]  Crazy.
[31:10.680 --> 31:12.200]  Let's take a break, I'll do the first sponsor.
[31:12.200 --> 31:16.200]  And it is our good friends at Fracture.
[31:16.200 --> 31:21.080]  Guys, remember Fracture, you send them your photos
[31:21.080 --> 31:25.080]  and they send them back to you, printed directly on glass.
[31:26.400 --> 31:30.400]  Not paper with a piece of glass in front of it on the frame.
[31:30.400 --> 31:32.440]  The picture is printed right on the glass.
[31:32.440 --> 31:34.120]  I've never seen anything else like it.
[31:35.240 --> 31:37.640]  You really do kind of have to see it to believe it.
[31:37.640 --> 31:40.480]  It really makes it seem as though it's right there on the surface.
[31:40.480 --> 31:43.080]  I always compare it to like when the iPhone switched
[31:43.080 --> 31:47.000]  to the laminated displays, putting the pixels closer
[31:47.000 --> 31:47.720]  to the glass.
[31:48.680 --> 31:50.080]  It's exactly that sort of effect,
[31:50.080 --> 31:53.800]  but with an analog print of your photos.
[31:53.800 --> 31:56.640]  They have all sorts of sizes to choose from.
[31:56.640 --> 31:58.600]  The square ones that Marco has made famous
[31:58.600 --> 32:01.440]  for printing your app icons for every time he sells an app
[32:01.440 --> 32:04.520]  to somebody he makes a copy.
[32:04.520 --> 32:05.360]  Looks really nice.
[32:05.360 --> 32:08.680]  I've been in Marco's office, they look great on the wall.
[32:08.680 --> 32:11.560]  To really, really big ones, big rectangular ones,
[32:11.560 --> 32:15.000]  they ship in these amazing containers
[32:15.000 --> 32:18.360]  that double as like the frame that you can use
[32:18.360 --> 32:23.280]  to hang on the wall or to put on your desk, propped up.
[32:23.280 --> 32:26.000]  Right there in this nifty cardboard shipping container.
[32:26.000 --> 32:28.520]  You don't have to buy an extra frame to put the thing in.
[32:28.520 --> 32:31.000]  You can mount them directly on the wall just as the glass.
[32:31.000 --> 32:32.240]  They look really cool.
[32:33.440 --> 32:34.760]  So there's nothing else to buy.
[32:34.760 --> 32:36.160]  It's not like when you get printouts
[32:36.160 --> 32:38.200]  and then you have to go put them in a frame
[32:38.200 --> 32:40.520]  and you have to take the frame apart
[32:40.520 --> 32:42.360]  and then it's easy, so easy.
[32:42.360 --> 32:43.800]  You descend them in your pictures.
[32:43.800 --> 32:47.400]  They send you back, printouts of them on glass.
[32:50.240 --> 32:51.360]  Where do you go to find out more?
[32:51.360 --> 32:55.840]  Go to their website, fracture, I think it's fractureme.com.
[32:55.840 --> 32:56.680]  That's correct.
[32:57.880 --> 32:59.960]  And there's a new coupon code.
[32:59.960 --> 33:03.520]  Use this code, daring fireball, all one word.
[33:03.520 --> 33:08.000]  And you will save 15% on whatever you order.
[33:08.000 --> 33:09.000]  So that's great.
[33:09.000 --> 33:10.560]  The prices are already fantastic.
[33:10.560 --> 33:13.960]  Save 15% though, use that code daring fireball
[33:13.960 --> 33:18.280]  and go to fractureme.com and see for yourself.
[33:20.200 --> 33:23.040]  Great sponsor, really, really recommend them.
[33:23.040 --> 33:26.200]  Yeah, I'm looking right at five fracture prints
[33:26.200 --> 33:27.240]  in my office right now.
[33:27.240 --> 33:29.840]  Oh my God, we have them all over the place.
[33:29.840 --> 33:31.520]  And it's a great gift idea too.
[33:34.880 --> 33:37.600]  So I don't know, immediate backlash, not backlash.
[33:37.600 --> 33:42.600]  Over over over representation of your thing
[33:43.640 --> 33:45.560]  is kind of interesting and it's sad and depressing.
[33:45.560 --> 33:48.000]  But I feel like the better topic is to actually talk
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.640]  about some of the problems Apple software has.
[33:51.640 --> 33:55.000]  Because one of the things I got is it definitely,
[33:55.000 --> 33:58.520]  because it hits such a mainstream media thing.
[33:58.520 --> 34:00.560]  I mean, people within Apple definitely noticed.
[34:00.560 --> 34:04.640]  And I heard from a couple of friends at Apple,
[34:04.640 --> 34:08.840]  not like PR, not like Apple PR region telling me,
[34:08.840 --> 34:11.120]  trying to spin it or anything, just like engineers.
[34:11.120 --> 34:14.560]  And some of them, it was really interesting
[34:14.560 --> 34:15.960]  what they said, all of them said different things.
[34:15.960 --> 34:17.840]  But like one of them was pretty surprised.
[34:17.840 --> 34:20.080]  And more or less of, do you really think that?
[34:20.080 --> 34:25.080]  Because this is the friend at Apple's more or less paraphrase
[34:25.720 --> 34:29.520]  that I think that we've been doing pretty good.
[34:29.520 --> 34:34.000]  It seems to me like the open bugs in radar are lower
[34:34.000 --> 34:35.600]  than they used to be years ago.
[34:36.920 --> 34:37.760]  Do you really think that?
[34:37.760 --> 34:39.880]  And I said, I have to say, there is something to it though.
[34:39.880 --> 34:42.800]  It seems to me like there's more annoyances
[34:42.800 --> 34:44.280]  than there used to be.
[34:44.280 --> 34:45.760]  But there were definitely some people with an Apple
[34:45.760 --> 34:47.160]  who disagreed.
[34:47.160 --> 34:48.800]  And then there were some who did agree.
[34:51.000 --> 34:53.040]  But I'm curious specifically,
[34:53.040 --> 34:54.480]  because that's one thing Oracle didn't have.
[34:54.480 --> 34:57.520]  It didn't really have a list of, here's some of the bugs.
[34:57.520 --> 35:01.280]  Right, and that was ultimately a failing.
[35:01.280 --> 35:04.840]  I wasn't really talking about like, here's five things
[35:04.840 --> 35:07.360]  that are the problems today.
[35:07.360 --> 35:08.960]  I was really talking about the general trend.
[35:08.960 --> 35:12.080]  And so it's hard to give a comprehensive list of examples
[35:12.080 --> 35:15.120]  because many of these things are like little annoyances
[35:15.120 --> 35:18.880]  or little occasional failures or occasional bugs.
[35:20.440 --> 35:23.160]  I heard from a few different engineers
[35:23.160 --> 35:27.000]  and I read a couple of Reddit comments from people
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.320]  who are allegedly within Apple and stuff.
[35:29.320 --> 35:34.320]  And it seems to be a few people thought
[35:34.520 --> 35:35.920]  that everything's fine.
[35:35.920 --> 35:39.280]  But most of the people seem to think that,
[35:39.280 --> 35:41.960]  yeah, like finally, thank you for saying this,
[35:41.960 --> 35:42.880]  like that kind of attitude.
[35:42.880 --> 35:45.280]  Like, yes, this is like no one listens,
[35:45.280 --> 35:46.320]  that kind of thing.
[35:46.320 --> 35:48.760]  And it's hard to get a read on what the truth is
[35:48.760 --> 35:50.720]  or even if these people over the real people,
[35:50.720 --> 35:52.360]  who actually work at Apple, who knows.
[35:53.360 --> 35:55.560]  It could have just been some random person on the internet.
[35:55.560 --> 35:59.800]  But I think there's, like, you're comment about like,
[35:59.800 --> 36:00.920]  the number of radars.
[36:00.920 --> 36:05.040]  Like, Apple could be measuring things
[36:05.040 --> 36:10.040]  that don't reflect the overall usage of annoyances
[36:10.120 --> 36:12.680]  and bugs that actually hit people in real life.
[36:12.680 --> 36:14.640]  They could just be measuring the wrong things
[36:14.640 --> 36:16.760]  or the things they're measuring aren't changing.
[36:16.760 --> 36:20.320]  And so for instance, they have the built-in crash reporter
[36:20.320 --> 36:23.000]  in every recent version of AWS
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.480]  that you can say automatically send diagnostics to Apple
[36:25.480 --> 36:27.640]  and when stuff breaks.
[36:27.640 --> 36:32.160]  But that only will send a report if a crash happened.
[36:32.160 --> 36:35.440]  Like, if you hit a bug that wasn't a crash,
[36:35.440 --> 36:38.000]  that's not gonna include that.
[36:38.000 --> 36:42.120]  And most of the bugs I see recently aren't crashes.
[36:42.120 --> 36:44.960]  Like, I'm not getting Colonel Pan X at my computers,
[36:44.960 --> 36:46.960]  you know, or, you know, back when I was,
[36:46.960 --> 36:49.840]  that was the fault of some IO driver, you know.
[36:49.840 --> 36:51.240]  Yeah, and that's one of the things I heard
[36:51.240 --> 36:54.480]  from one of the people who was sort of not,
[36:54.480 --> 36:55.800]  not really believing in that.
[36:55.800 --> 36:59.000]  It was that specifically that crashes are down,
[36:59.000 --> 37:00.960]  you know, and that's something that they can measure
[37:00.960 --> 37:02.360]  because they have a crash reporter
[37:02.360 --> 37:07.360]  and that it just made him surprised that this was a thing.
[37:08.800 --> 37:12.640]  And it really was, it was not like a defensive take.
[37:12.640 --> 37:14.760]  It's like typical Apple person, very thoughtful,
[37:15.840 --> 37:17.760]  really, really genuinely curious
[37:17.760 --> 37:20.640]  because he found it surprising, really wanted to know.
[37:20.640 --> 37:24.720]  And also, absolutely believed in the sort of,
[37:24.720 --> 37:27.160]  hey, when there's smoke, there's fire, you know,
[37:27.160 --> 37:30.760]  clearly this Marco's post resonated with a lot of people.
[37:30.760 --> 37:33.600]  So I want to get to the bottom of, you know,
[37:33.600 --> 37:36.160]  what this is, but crashes definitely aren't it?
[37:36.160 --> 37:37.000]  Exactly.
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.240]  And like, like earlier tonight,
[37:39.240 --> 37:42.400]  one of the many annoyances when using an Apple TV,
[37:43.720 --> 37:45.720]  you know, I turn on the Apple TV
[37:45.720 --> 37:48.400]  after it being asleep for most of the day,
[37:48.400 --> 37:51.520]  and it shows three prompts in a row that say
[37:51.520 --> 37:53.560]  your Apple TV is not connected to the internet.
[37:53.560 --> 37:55.320]  Like you hit menu and just shows you another one.
[37:55.320 --> 37:57.320]  And like, so there's three of those that were queued up.
[37:57.320 --> 38:00.040]  So those aren't being coalesced.
[38:00.040 --> 38:02.760]  And then I go back to the home screen
[38:02.760 --> 38:05.800]  and it is going to be internet and showing new stuff.
[38:05.800 --> 38:08.160]  So they were at the state and weren't canceled.
[38:08.160 --> 38:10.280]  Right. At which point those things should have been
[38:10.280 --> 38:12.360]  disregarded anyway, never mind it, right?
[38:12.360 --> 38:13.440]  File under, never mind.
[38:13.440 --> 38:15.480]  Right. Why were they even showing when it was asleep
[38:15.480 --> 38:17.120]  and nobody was trying to do anything with it?
[38:17.120 --> 38:18.360]  Good question there too.
[38:18.360 --> 38:20.280]  So those are all quality issues, right?
[38:20.280 --> 38:21.400]  Not crashes.
[38:21.400 --> 38:23.200]  They're not going to show up at any bug reports
[38:23.200 --> 38:24.280]  because I'm not going to report it.
[38:24.280 --> 38:25.120]  Look, I'm talking to you.
[38:25.120 --> 38:27.320]  I'm not going to report that on radar.
[38:27.320 --> 38:29.040]  Like it's not worth the time to even type it up
[38:29.040 --> 38:30.480]  and go through all the forms.
[38:31.960 --> 38:36.120]  Then I hit menu a couple times to get out of the,
[38:36.120 --> 38:39.000]  the like deep hierarchy of the movie structure I was in
[38:39.000 --> 38:40.080]  to get back to the home screen.
[38:40.080 --> 38:40.920]  I know you can just hold it down,
[38:40.920 --> 38:43.800]  but I didn't, the first time I hit it,
[38:43.800 --> 38:45.760]  it went boop and it did, it did its thing.
[38:45.760 --> 38:46.920]  And then the second time I hit it,
[38:46.920 --> 38:48.520]  I just went boop, boop, boop, boop.
[38:48.520 --> 38:50.760]  And I kept hitting it and nothing was happening.
[38:50.760 --> 38:52.640]  And all the clicks just queued up and queued up
[38:52.640 --> 38:53.840]  and queued up and nothing happened.
[38:53.840 --> 38:56.080]  And I'm like, all right, do I reset it?
[38:56.080 --> 38:59.000]  And then like 30 seconds later, it executes all of them.
[38:59.000 --> 39:00.320]  Like because they had all queued up.
[39:00.320 --> 39:01.760]  So everything's moving around like crazy.
[39:01.760 --> 39:03.880]  I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, it's not what I wanted.
[39:05.160 --> 39:06.720]  Again, another bug.
[39:06.720 --> 39:09.520]  Two nights ago I had to actually unplug it
[39:09.520 --> 39:11.960]  and plug it back in to get it to respond
[39:11.960 --> 39:13.880]  to any remote commands.
[39:13.880 --> 39:15.440]  I tried two different remotes.
[39:15.440 --> 39:17.200]  We have multiple Apple TVs in the house.
[39:17.200 --> 39:18.640]  They both have similar bugs.
[39:18.640 --> 39:21.880]  So I know it's not just one of them being dying or flaky.
[39:23.200 --> 39:25.840]  And I know, I mean, certainly Merlin has talked a lot
[39:25.840 --> 39:27.600]  about his Apple TV issues too.
[39:27.600 --> 39:29.760]  That there's issues with authenticating content.
[39:29.760 --> 39:32.640]  He's like the Jeffrey Zeldman of Apple TV.
[39:32.640 --> 39:33.480]  You know, like the way that-
[39:33.480 --> 39:34.480]  Like everything.
[39:34.480 --> 39:36.480]  Zeldman just has the worst Murphy's law
[39:36.480 --> 39:38.000]  with anything technology.
[39:38.000 --> 39:42.560]  Like Merlin clearly has caught like the Apple TV branch
[39:42.560 --> 39:44.400]  of that syndrome.
[39:44.400 --> 39:45.240]  Right, exactly.
[39:45.240 --> 39:47.400]  And like I don't think it's uncommon, you know?
[39:47.400 --> 39:51.280]  And like, you know, I so often like we'll go to watch a movie
[39:51.280 --> 39:53.680]  and it'll sit there on authorizing forever
[39:53.680 --> 39:55.320]  and then eventually fail.
[39:55.320 --> 39:56.840]  And it's really like, come on.
[39:56.840 --> 39:57.680]  I bought this.
[39:57.680 --> 39:58.360]  These are movies we bought.
[39:58.360 --> 40:00.200]  My kid is like sitting down.
[40:00.200 --> 40:01.280]  He wants to watch something.
[40:01.280 --> 40:02.520]  It doesn't show him in a minute.
[40:02.520 --> 40:04.360]  He's gonna start getting antsy and possibly scream.
[40:04.360 --> 40:06.640]  Like, come on, just come on, work.
[40:06.640 --> 40:07.480]  That's all.
[40:08.440 --> 40:10.240]  And this is just the Apple TV, right?
[40:10.240 --> 40:13.560]  And airplane to the Apple TV works
[40:13.560 --> 40:15.680]  about a quarter of the time.
[40:15.680 --> 40:16.880]  And it doesn't work.
[40:16.880 --> 40:18.720]  I can vouch for the fact that it doesn't work
[40:18.720 --> 40:21.800]  with a two or three-year-old to try to explain
[40:21.800 --> 40:24.560]  how in the old days we'd have to get in the car
[40:24.560 --> 40:25.840]  and drive to Blockbuster.
[40:25.840 --> 40:27.760]  And the disc might be scratched.
[40:27.760 --> 40:28.960]  Right, yeah, exactly.
[40:28.960 --> 40:31.400]  Yeah, kids don't want to hear it.
[40:31.400 --> 40:33.640]  Kids expect the thing that they see on the screen
[40:33.640 --> 40:36.120]  to play when you punch the button.
[40:36.120 --> 40:37.040]  Exactly.
[40:37.040 --> 40:40.080]  So, and so this is just Apple TV.
[40:40.080 --> 40:42.960]  This is just like one week's worth of
[40:42.960 --> 40:45.680]  just like what I can recall, not even when we,
[40:45.680 --> 40:47.560]  what I can recall over the last two days.
[40:47.560 --> 40:50.040]  This is like, this is what goes on over the Apple TV.
[40:50.040 --> 40:52.080]  And that's not even, not even including
[40:52.080 --> 40:55.240]  various like, you know, infinite timeouts
[40:55.240 --> 40:57.720]  and failures with Netflix, which I'll give Apple
[40:57.720 --> 41:00.440]  advantage of the doubt and assume that Netflix is problem.
[41:00.440 --> 41:02.040]  But, you know, even, but like with Apple stuff,
[41:02.040 --> 41:03.440]  authorizing the Apple purchase stuff,
[41:03.440 --> 41:05.200]  even that, you know, that has all those problems.
[41:05.200 --> 41:07.520]  So, that's just one product, right?
[41:07.520 --> 41:10.480]  And it's an airplane, and I hear from everybody
[41:10.480 --> 41:12.040]  that airplane doesn't work well for them.
[41:12.040 --> 41:13.960]  Airplay works fine for me
[41:13.960 --> 41:17.000]  if I'm going to an airport express
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.400]  that I have connected to a speaker in my kitchen.
[41:19.400 --> 41:20.360]  It works fine for that.
[41:20.360 --> 41:22.440]  It fails every time for Apple TV.
[41:22.440 --> 41:25.320]  Or, sorry, it fails 75% of the time for Apple TV.
[41:25.320 --> 41:27.800]  Like, I'll do it a couple times, eventually it will take.
[41:27.800 --> 41:30.760]  Airplay is on my list, and it's high on the list
[41:30.760 --> 41:34.760]  because in terms of like, canary and the coal mine,
[41:34.760 --> 41:37.000]  because it used to be rock solid for me.
[41:37.000 --> 41:40.640]  And my typical airplay scenario is almost always,
[41:40.640 --> 41:44.720]  is either from my phone or from an iPad to Apple TV.
[41:47.320 --> 41:51.320]  A good example of it is we didn't have Amazon instant video
[41:51.320 --> 41:54.600]  on TV until we got a new Tivo sometime
[41:54.600 --> 41:55.800]  that I can get in the last year,
[41:55.800 --> 41:57.600]  and it has Amazon built in.
[41:57.600 --> 41:59.320]  Because Amazon, I don't know what,
[41:59.320 --> 42:01.640]  but they don't have an app on Apple TV,
[42:01.640 --> 42:03.960]  whether it's politics or what.
[42:03.960 --> 42:05.240]  But if you wanted to watch something.
[42:05.240 --> 42:06.480]  Oh, it's definitely politics.
[42:06.480 --> 42:07.600]  Yeah, I'm guessing it's politics.
[42:07.600 --> 42:09.480]  Why do you think they're advertising watches so heavily
[42:09.480 --> 42:11.000]  to every man who visits to the site?
[42:13.520 --> 42:14.360]  Are they really?
[42:14.360 --> 42:18.360]  Yeah, ask any man who visited Amazon recently,
[42:18.360 --> 42:19.520]  like what's on the front page?
[42:19.520 --> 42:24.440]  And it's the bottom of the first screen
[42:24.440 --> 42:28.640]  on Amazon.com's front page is all top men's watches.
[42:28.640 --> 42:31.520]  I have never viewed a link to a watch on Amazon.
[42:31.520 --> 42:33.640]  I've never searched for a watch on Amazon.
[42:33.640 --> 42:36.240]  I have done nothing that would influence that recommendation,
[42:36.240 --> 42:37.640]  and it's heavily promoting watches.
[42:37.640 --> 42:40.320]  And I've heard, I tweeted about it a couple of weeks ago,
[42:40.320 --> 42:41.520]  and a bunch of other guys were like,
[42:41.520 --> 42:42.880]  yeah, me too, they showed screenshots.
[42:42.880 --> 42:45.560]  Like, I'm like, they're so heavily pushing watches right now.
[42:45.560 --> 42:48.880]  It's like, come on, obviously this is about politics.
[42:48.880 --> 42:53.560]  Mine is literally men's blue dial luxury watches.
[42:53.560 --> 42:56.760]  I swear to God, I gotta say to the link right now.
[42:56.760 --> 42:58.600]  All right, have you ever looked at a watch on Amazon?
[42:58.600 --> 43:00.680]  You see, that's why you might have heard.
[43:00.680 --> 43:03.440]  Yeah, because I don't own, I only own two watches,
[43:03.440 --> 43:05.920]  but I love, I've always loved watches,
[43:05.920 --> 43:08.280]  but it's like, I only buy them if I think they're absolutely
[43:08.280 --> 43:10.920]  perfect, this is why I only got two,
[43:10.920 --> 43:13.000]  but I look at watches all the time.
[43:13.000 --> 43:14.840]  I don't, and I don't really look for them on Amazon
[43:14.840 --> 43:16.760]  because Amazon, I don't think it's a type of place
[43:16.760 --> 43:17.600]  where I would buy a watch.
[43:17.600 --> 43:19.480]  Although I did, actually I did buy one there years ago.
[43:19.480 --> 43:22.040]  I bought my, my citizen there.
[43:22.040 --> 43:25.240]  But no, I didn't, actually I did the right thing
[43:25.240 --> 43:27.000]  with the citizen where I found it on Amazon,
[43:27.000 --> 43:28.600]  but I wanted to see it in person,
[43:28.600 --> 43:30.480]  and I went to a jewelry store here in Philadelphia
[43:30.480 --> 43:33.600]  so I could see it, and it was $15 more expensive
[43:33.600 --> 43:35.160]  in the jewelry store, and I thought,
[43:35.160 --> 43:36.760]  well, this is exactly what I should do.
[43:36.760 --> 43:39.040]  I'm gonna buy it right here because I'm so glad
[43:39.040 --> 43:42.240]  there's a jewelry store here where I could see it.
[43:42.240 --> 43:43.840]  I wanted to give them $15 more.
[43:43.840 --> 43:45.520]  Wow, you were in the showroom, that's great.
[43:45.520 --> 43:47.560]  Right, I know that that's, and I thought,
[43:47.560 --> 43:51.840]  you know what, I'm not like the 1% top financial people,
[43:51.840 --> 43:55.760]  I'm the 1% who just shops thinking like that, like,
[43:55.760 --> 43:57.560]  yeah.
[43:57.560 --> 44:00.440]  The Amazon 1%, yeah.
[44:00.440 --> 44:02.680]  It reminds me there was a New Yorker a couple weeks ago
[44:02.680 --> 44:06.320]  where on the cover there was a woman answering her door
[44:06.320 --> 44:09.440]  to take an Amazon box from UPS
[44:09.440 --> 44:11.240]  that was clearly like the size of the ones
[44:11.240 --> 44:12.880]  that they shipped the books in,
[44:12.880 --> 44:14.560]  looking awkwardly at her neighbor
[44:14.560 --> 44:16.760]  who runs a little neighborhood bookstore.
[44:16.760 --> 44:20.200]  That's awesome.
[44:20.200 --> 44:23.280]  But anyway, I do have men's blue dial luxury watches
[44:23.280 --> 44:25.240]  right on the front page of my Amazon.
[44:25.240 --> 44:27.160]  Right, so anyway, so Apple TV.
[44:27.160 --> 44:29.640]  So I had to, until we had the TVO,
[44:29.640 --> 44:33.120]  I had to airplay Amazon to the Apple TV.
[44:33.120 --> 44:36.280]  And it always worked, it just worked, it was great.
[44:36.280 --> 44:40.320]  And a couple days ago, I wanted to watch Alpha House,
[44:40.320 --> 44:44.080]  which is a cool, I really fun show I like on Amazon.
[44:44.080 --> 44:46.920]  And I was too lazy to switch the TV
[44:46.920 --> 44:51.160]  from Apple TV where I already was to Tivo.
[44:51.160 --> 44:53.880]  And the Tivo is such a pain in the ass anyway.
[44:53.880 --> 44:55.400]  So I tried to use an airplane.
[44:55.400 --> 44:57.560]  And it, I just got like a spinner
[44:57.560 --> 45:00.800]  and it just spun and spun and spun and spun and spun.
[45:00.800 --> 45:03.200]  And eventually I just did have to switch to the Tivo
[45:03.200 --> 45:05.440]  and use the Amazon app there.
[45:05.440 --> 45:08.400]  Yeah, that spinner should be the Apple TV logo.
[45:08.400 --> 45:10.120]  It used to work on the front.
[45:10.120 --> 45:14.200]  For me, it used to work very, very, very consistently.
[45:14.200 --> 45:17.120]  Yeah, any video that wasn't,
[45:17.120 --> 45:18.920]  I think there's a flag you can set to say,
[45:18.920 --> 45:21.960]  don't you can't airplay, but almost nobody set it back then.
[45:21.960 --> 45:25.320]  Almost any video that I could watch on iPhone or iPad,
[45:25.320 --> 45:27.960]  I could switch, I could just flick it,
[45:27.960 --> 45:30.800]  continuity style to the Apple TV in,
[45:30.800 --> 45:32.040]  I don't know how many seconds,
[45:32.040 --> 45:35.240]  but a few enough seconds that it felt like magic every time.
[45:35.240 --> 45:38.080]  And now it's really, really a crap shoot.
[45:38.080 --> 45:39.080]  Exactly.
[45:39.080 --> 45:42.240]  And yeah, I mean, I've owned every generation of Apple TV
[45:42.240 --> 45:44.680]  and we use them constantly because we don't have cable.
[45:44.680 --> 45:48.200]  Like that's, the Apple TV is our primary video player.
[45:48.200 --> 45:51.600]  We are, like the only media playback we have in our house
[45:51.600 --> 45:55.800]  is Apple TV and a PS3 for Blu-ray discs, that's it.
[45:55.800 --> 45:57.880]  And so we use them heavily.
[45:57.880 --> 46:01.720]  And it has, it has definitely been a noticeable decline.
[46:01.720 --> 46:04.160]  Like the, they weren't, they didn't used to be this bad.
[46:04.160 --> 46:05.960]  And so again, we can sit here all night
[46:05.960 --> 46:07.240]  and point out things about the Apple TV.
[46:07.240 --> 46:10.040]  I mean, like, it's, it looks, I mean,
[46:10.040 --> 46:11.480]  this is probably as interesting as hearing somebody.
[46:11.480 --> 46:13.160]  It's like terrible airline story
[46:13.160 --> 46:14.880]  or they're, or they're dream from last night.
[46:14.880 --> 46:16.720]  You know, so I don't want to bore the audience
[46:16.720 --> 46:19.200]  with all the different little nitpicks of like how
[46:19.200 --> 46:22.440]  my stuff has failed, but you can look at a lot of their
[46:22.440 --> 46:25.520]  product recently and see a lot of stories like this
[46:25.520 --> 46:26.720]  from everybody.
[46:26.720 --> 46:28.560]  Glen Fellishman solicited things on Twitter
[46:28.560 --> 46:30.400]  and it had a really good post like kind of summarizing
[46:30.400 --> 46:32.280]  like here's what everyone's complaining about.
[46:32.280 --> 46:33.120]  Oh, did you see that?
[46:33.120 --> 46:36.800]  Where did he post that on, on glog.glanf.com.
[46:36.800 --> 46:40.400]  And I think, yeah, check it, anyway,
[46:40.400 --> 46:42.400]  you can sort through his tweets for the last two days
[46:42.400 --> 46:44.640]  to try to find a lake if you're brave.
[46:44.640 --> 46:46.800]  My Twitter client doesn't go back that far.
[46:46.800 --> 46:51.600]  Carry two days of Glen Fellishman tweets.
[46:51.600 --> 46:54.240]  So, I don't know what kind, I don't know what's my news.
[46:54.240 --> 46:56.160]  I think you'd need like a special API.
[46:56.160 --> 46:57.840]  I don't even think the Twitter API could handle.
[46:57.840 --> 47:00.520]  Anyway, it is on the front page of his blog
[47:00.520 --> 47:02.360]  and I will put it in the show notes.
[47:02.360 --> 47:03.160]  Yeah, so do that.
[47:03.160 --> 47:04.960]  And so, so that that's part of it like,
[47:04.960 --> 47:08.440]  and I've had issues with, with Yosemite.
[47:08.440 --> 47:10.280]  Similar to like, I know Neven Merger
[47:10.280 --> 47:13.920]  was talking on Twitter a couple of, a couple of weeks back
[47:13.920 --> 47:17.120]  about like, he showed a screenshot of how many copies
[47:17.120 --> 47:19.840]  of his computer there were in the finder source list
[47:19.840 --> 47:21.680]  of like the network share area of the finder,
[47:21.680 --> 47:23.000]  the finder left pane.
[47:23.000 --> 47:24.640]  And it was like, you know, Neven Merger's laptop,
[47:24.640 --> 47:25.720]  two, three, four, five, six.
[47:25.720 --> 47:27.440]  And like, there's giant list of like,
[47:27.440 --> 47:29.120]  all these different copies like,
[47:29.120 --> 47:31.800]  I've had a lot of issues with that of like,
[47:31.800 --> 47:34.400]  things like losing my original computer's name,
[47:34.400 --> 47:36.680]  showing up as parentheses two,
[47:36.680 --> 47:39.560]  or certain computers just disappearing off my network.
[47:39.560 --> 47:41.720]  We have three computers on our home network here
[47:41.720 --> 47:43.000]  and one printer.
[47:43.000 --> 47:46.280]  And, and, and they, a, a NAS box in the closet
[47:46.280 --> 47:47.720]  for network share stuff.
[47:47.720 --> 47:50.840]  And at any given time, I can usually only see
[47:50.840 --> 47:52.640]  between zero and two of them.
[47:52.640 --> 47:56.360]  And like, and it just like, usually you have to reboot
[47:56.360 --> 47:57.520]  not the one that's browsing,
[47:57.520 --> 48:00.040]  but you have to reboot the one that's not showing up.
[48:00.040 --> 48:01.520]  I haven't read going directly.
[48:01.520 --> 48:03.080]  Obviously since I was unaware of it,
[48:03.080 --> 48:04.440]  but I can't wait to.
[48:04.440 --> 48:07.680]  But I don't know if his summary goes like this,
[48:07.680 --> 48:10.720]  but yours does so far and a couple that I have jotted down
[48:10.720 --> 48:14.840]  all fit in the category of things that don't even have air,
[48:14.840 --> 48:17.480]  they're not crashers and they don't have error messages,
[48:17.480 --> 48:20.520]  although you, they're just silent failures.
[48:20.520 --> 48:21.360]  Exactly.
[48:21.360 --> 48:24.520]  And so, and there are some crashers,
[48:24.520 --> 48:26.480]  but usually like most people aren't hitting them most
[48:26.480 --> 48:28.800]  of the time, I think like, you know, like there are,
[48:28.800 --> 48:32.760]  like crashers are, they're a bigger problem iOS, I think.
[48:32.760 --> 48:35.360]  You know, and iOS seven, I think was worse than iOS eight
[48:35.360 --> 48:36.200]  in regards to crashers.
[48:36.200 --> 48:38.720]  But, so for instance, on iOS eight,
[48:38.720 --> 48:43.200]  overcast crashes more than did in iOS seven in a few key areas.
[48:43.200 --> 48:44.640]  And I don't know if it's my fault or not,
[48:44.640 --> 48:46.160]  but I've heard from a lot of other developers too.
[48:46.160 --> 48:48.120]  One developer even posted stats,
[48:48.120 --> 48:50.320]  they're absolutely runs on both and they posted stats
[48:50.320 --> 48:54.360]  like percentage of installs that have crashed on seven versus eight.
[48:54.360 --> 48:57.920]  And the percentage on eight was five times higher.
[48:57.920 --> 49:00.000]  And like, and like, and I've had crashes
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.560]  like deeply deep in system frameworks, like image IO,
[49:03.560 --> 49:07.160]  I have crashes like decoding JPEGs for a show art.
[49:07.160 --> 49:10.400]  That crashes a lot, and I would say never happen in seven.
[49:10.400 --> 49:13.080]  Stuff like that, like, and you know,
[49:13.080 --> 49:16.640]  the background downloading system occasionally has crashes.
[49:16.640 --> 49:18.400]  The audio subsystem will crash,
[49:18.400 --> 49:19.880]  and everyone will blame me for it.
[49:19.880 --> 49:24.200]  There's so many like subsystem or API,
[49:24.200 --> 49:28.880]  like low-level failures or crashes that happen just rarely enough
[49:28.880 --> 49:30.680]  that it's really hard to ever track it down,
[49:30.680 --> 49:32.960]  but frequently enough that if you have a crash logger
[49:32.960 --> 49:35.800]  in your app, you're gonna see a lot of reports for it.
[49:35.800 --> 49:38.280]  Another one for me, and I tweeted about this,
[49:38.280 --> 49:40.760]  and I actually got somebody from Apple reached out
[49:40.760 --> 49:42.320]  and they said they're gonna look into it,
[49:42.320 --> 49:46.240]  and, but for me, it's that the keyboard shortcuts,
[49:46.240 --> 49:49.000]  not command keys, but like when you have
[49:50.160 --> 49:52.800]  T-E-H go to T-E.
[49:52.800 --> 49:53.800]  Oh, like the Texas Bandit Ball?
[49:53.800 --> 49:54.640]  T-E-T.
[49:54.640 --> 49:58.280]  Yeah, well, I think the, all right.
[49:58.280 --> 49:59.520]  Yeah, the Texas Bandit report.
[49:59.520 --> 50:02.800]  Well, okay, the feature of similar to Texas Bandit.
[50:02.800 --> 50:05.040]  I think that's a perfect example, though,
[50:05.040 --> 50:08.440]  of them adding a feature to the system
[50:08.440 --> 50:11.480]  in an appropriate way where it still leaves
[50:11.480 --> 50:13.640]  a Texas Bander plenty of room.
[50:13.640 --> 50:14.480]  Oh, yeah.
[50:14.480 --> 50:17.400]  Because they just do, you type this, you get that,
[50:17.400 --> 50:20.120]  whereas Texas Bander has all of the interactive stuff
[50:20.120 --> 50:22.040]  where you can have, you know.
[50:22.040 --> 50:23.680]  You have a form is almost a Texas Bander.
[50:23.680 --> 50:26.120]  Yeah, or like I've got the Texas Bander ones
[50:26.120 --> 50:27.640]  to put the date in certain formats,
[50:27.640 --> 50:28.480]  right, right.
[50:28.480 --> 50:30.480]  Type my key, you know, my little shortcut,
[50:30.480 --> 50:32.680]  and I get today's date, right, the way I like it.
[50:32.680 --> 50:35.120]  You can't do that, you know, dynamic ones, variables.
[50:35.120 --> 50:35.960]  Right.
[50:35.960 --> 50:40.600]  Anyway, but they, they used to sync between devices
[50:40.600 --> 50:44.040]  and then they stopped syncing.
[50:44.040 --> 50:46.280]  And they stopped syncing when I switched
[50:46.280 --> 50:51.280]  to the iCloud documents in the cloud beta.
[50:51.280 --> 50:52.120]  The drive?
[50:52.120 --> 50:53.880]  iCloud drive beta, which I had to do over some,
[50:53.880 --> 50:55.520]  I didn't have to, but I did over some
[50:55.520 --> 50:57.640]  of it because I was beta testing some stuff
[50:57.640 --> 50:59.480]  that, you know, I wanted to use it and try it.
[50:59.480 --> 51:01.200]  And so the fact that it stopped working then,
[51:01.200 --> 51:03.880]  I understood because maybe they were using, you know,
[51:03.880 --> 51:05.600]  when they warn you, hey, when you switch,
[51:05.600 --> 51:07.680]  you can't go back, you know, you're always on it.
[51:07.680 --> 51:09.560]  And so I thought, oh, so that's interesting.
[51:09.560 --> 51:12.600]  They must have been using the old storage APIs
[51:12.600 --> 51:15.080]  for these keyboard shortcuts and that's how they did it.
[51:15.080 --> 51:17.280]  But now, you know, here it was like two months
[51:17.280 --> 51:19.320]  after everything had come out of beta, you know.
[51:19.320 --> 51:23.280]  I was running a new phone, running iOS nine.
[51:23.280 --> 51:28.360]  I was running a new, it's just to make it even more
[51:28.360 --> 51:32.960]  likely that it should work, a brand new Retina MacBook Pro
[51:32.960 --> 51:36.720]  running the non beta, you know, version of Yosemite.
[51:36.720 --> 51:39.840]  And it's, they still weren't syncing.
[51:39.840 --> 51:41.040]  No, nothing was syncing.
[51:41.040 --> 51:42.920]  None of the most shortcuts were syncing.
[51:44.480 --> 51:47.040]  And then, and this is, this to me emblemizes
[51:47.040 --> 51:50.120]  the sort of thing I'm thinking that, you know,
[51:50.120 --> 51:55.080]  is the modern Apple unsteady software.
[51:55.080 --> 51:57.840]  They did start syncing, but not all of them.
[51:57.840 --> 52:02.840]  And now, now like on my phone and on my Mac,
[52:03.920 --> 52:06.080]  almost all of them are the same.
[52:06.080 --> 52:07.880]  And I definitely never once,
[52:07.880 --> 52:09.200]  because I wanted to see what would happen.
[52:09.200 --> 52:11.960]  I never once like said, okay, just take 10 minutes
[52:11.960 --> 52:15.000]  and reproduce them in both places, so you have them all.
[52:15.000 --> 52:16.800]  I just wait it and they're mostly there.
[52:16.800 --> 52:19.240]  But there's one, in particular, sort of like a game
[52:19.240 --> 52:21.440]  of where's Waldo, like scrolling the two lists,
[52:21.440 --> 52:22.680]  trying to find the ones that are missing.
[52:22.680 --> 52:23.920]  And it's even made more difficult
[52:23.920 --> 52:27.560]  because they sort in a different order in terms of
[52:27.560 --> 52:29.120]  the way ones there.
[52:29.120 --> 52:31.440]  The way that once, like regular,
[52:31.440 --> 52:33.320]  if it's just alphabetical characters,
[52:33.320 --> 52:34.360]  they sort alphabetically.
[52:34.360 --> 52:36.560]  But the Mac puts the ones with punctual,
[52:36.560 --> 52:38.200]  leading punctuation at the top,
[52:38.200 --> 52:40.400]  and the iPhone puts ones with leading punctuation
[52:40.400 --> 52:41.080]  at the bottom.
[52:42.760 --> 52:44.440]  So it's a little hard to compare it to.
[52:44.440 --> 52:47.320]  Again, none of this is a reportable bug,
[52:47.320 --> 52:50.200]  like or rather none of this will report itself to Apple.
[52:50.200 --> 52:52.440]  Yeah, and it's so hard.
[52:52.440 --> 52:54.920]  But I know for example, I have a custom one
[52:54.920 --> 52:57.960]  because you can use it to add custom words
[52:57.960 --> 53:00.040]  and it's not even like an expansion.
[53:00.040 --> 53:03.080]  But I use the word navbar, as all one word,
[53:03.080 --> 53:06.800]  N-A-V-B-A-R, all the time when I'm talking
[53:06.800 --> 53:08.440]  with Dave Whiskus about Vesper.
[53:09.600 --> 53:12.360]  It's just, I call the thing at the top, the navbar.
[53:13.560 --> 53:15.640]  And it's always, always on the iPhone,
[53:15.640 --> 53:17.560]  like when I'd be iMessage and auto-correcting it
[53:17.560 --> 53:20.320]  into who knows what, just random guesses
[53:20.320 --> 53:21.960]  from the dictionary that we're close.
[53:21.960 --> 53:24.480]  So I put it in my thing, and it's on my phone,
[53:24.480 --> 53:25.920]  which is the place where I need it,
[53:25.920 --> 53:27.320]  but it's not on my Mac.
[53:28.200 --> 53:29.880]  Whereas like the other, I don't know,
[53:29.880 --> 53:33.280]  there's like maybe 30 of them seem mostly in sync.
[53:34.280 --> 53:36.680]  Crazy, like I don't, and there's never an error message,
[53:36.680 --> 53:39.800]  there's never any error on any device that says,
[53:39.800 --> 53:41.840]  hey, you've got a problem with your keyboards,
[53:41.840 --> 53:44.040]  shortcuts, syncing, turn it off, turn it back on again,
[53:44.040 --> 53:45.720]  or anything, nothing, no errors.
[53:45.720 --> 53:48.960]  I just don't have some of them on both devices.
[53:48.960 --> 53:50.600]  Yeah, it's even worse with this cloud stuff
[53:50.600 --> 53:52.880]  because you have so little insight
[53:52.880 --> 53:55.880]  as to what the problem is, if there's even a problem,
[53:55.880 --> 53:58.840]  or how to fix a problem that once it happens.
[53:58.840 --> 54:03.360]  And so like, if you look at Apple's
[54:04.800 --> 54:07.520]  crashed rate history, let's say somebody inside Apple
[54:07.520 --> 54:09.280]  is looking at like, well,
[54:09.280 --> 54:10.840]  we have the same rate of crashes now
[54:10.840 --> 54:13.080]  that we did five years ago, whatever it is.
[54:15.000 --> 54:18.040]  I think you have to also consider that now
[54:18.040 --> 54:21.240]  we are doing a lot more with our devices and our computers,
[54:21.240 --> 54:23.200]  we have more devices and computers
[54:23.200 --> 54:25.480]  and reacting with each other per person,
[54:25.480 --> 54:27.440]  especially around in these crowds.
[54:27.440 --> 54:31.520]  And the cloud services are this other factor.
[54:31.520 --> 54:33.320]  And so like, I said with an ATP,
[54:33.320 --> 54:34.680]  so I won't go too far into it here,
[54:34.680 --> 54:39.680]  but if let's say you have like a 1% bug rate for like,
[54:41.000 --> 54:44.560]  when you're using this app or this service of the OS,
[54:44.560 --> 54:46.400]  1% of the time it won't work right.
[54:46.400 --> 54:48.680]  Obviously, this is made up, but bear with me.
[54:48.680 --> 54:52.520]  If then you consider the interaction
[54:52.520 --> 54:56.040]  of two different apps or services that have the same rate,
[54:56.040 --> 54:59.520]  it's 2%, if you consider it again,
[54:59.520 --> 55:01.280]  it's not three, if you consider a third one,
[55:01.280 --> 55:03.000]  it's not 3%, it's 4%.
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.640]  Because these things don't add the multiply.
[55:05.640 --> 55:08.720]  Because every as you add more possible ways
[55:08.720 --> 55:11.920]  of interaction between applications, services,
[55:11.920 --> 55:15.040]  cloud services, devices, all those failure rates,
[55:15.040 --> 55:18.880]  the chances that any one thing is gonna go wrong somehow
[55:18.880 --> 55:23.480]  is the multiple, the product of all of those factors,
[55:23.480 --> 55:24.400]  not the sum.
[55:24.400 --> 55:27.000]  So this grows geometrically.
[55:27.000 --> 55:28.880]  And so as you make things more complicated,
[55:28.880 --> 55:30.280]  as our devices can do more,
[55:30.280 --> 55:32.120]  as we have more devices interacting with each other
[55:32.120 --> 55:34.800]  and also interacting with the cloud services,
[55:34.800 --> 55:38.400]  all of these error factors are all multiplied.
[55:38.400 --> 55:41.880]  And so you have to, you can't just keep quality
[55:41.880 --> 55:46.360]  the same as it used to be, like the quality rate per service
[55:46.360 --> 55:49.600]  or per app, it has to actually get better over time
[55:49.600 --> 55:51.880]  to keep the same overall error rate
[55:51.880 --> 55:53.280]  from happening to somebody.
[55:53.280 --> 55:54.120]  Yeah.
[55:56.080 --> 55:59.080]  Yeah, and I'm not accusing anybody at Apple of incompetence
[55:59.080 --> 56:02.760]  because I don't think any of these bugs are universal.
[56:02.760 --> 56:04.680]  It's not like nobody play or play.
[56:04.680 --> 56:05.520]  I'm sure.
[56:05.520 --> 56:06.800]  And I've written worse bugs today.
[56:06.800 --> 56:09.760]  I mean, I fixed a really embarrassing bug
[56:09.760 --> 56:13.000]  two hours ago and overcast, like really embarrassing.
[56:13.000 --> 56:13.840]  I would bet good.
[56:13.840 --> 56:15.040]  I mean, that's how real bugs are.
[56:15.040 --> 56:17.240]  Real bugs are edge cases to some degree.
[56:17.240 --> 56:18.920]  Maybe it's a big edge, but it's, you know,
[56:18.920 --> 56:22.280]  something you didn't think of most of the time.
[56:22.280 --> 56:24.040]  I'm thinking most of the time.
[56:24.040 --> 56:25.360]  I'm thinking if you go to an Apple store
[56:25.360 --> 56:30.120]  and buy a new Apple TV and you pick up a new iPhone or iPad
[56:30.120 --> 56:34.640]  and you set them up and create a brand new iCloud account
[56:34.640 --> 56:37.600]  and go to user play, it'll just work.
[56:37.600 --> 56:42.000]  It'll, I'll bet 99 times out of 100 that will just work.
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.800]  That there's no bug that's keeping most people from doing it,
[56:44.800 --> 56:47.120]  but there's clearly some bugs that, you know,
[56:47.120 --> 56:50.200]  and who knows, it might be like 100 different bugs,
[56:50.200 --> 56:51.520]  you know, that result in the same thing.
[56:51.520 --> 56:55.520]  And they're all, you know, just one tenth of one percent
[56:55.520 --> 56:57.960]  of people have taken that path.
[56:57.960 --> 57:00.840]  But then in the aggregate, it winds up where there's a lot
[57:00.840 --> 57:03.720]  of people who are having trouble, trouble with stuff like this.
[57:03.720 --> 57:04.560]  Exactly.
[57:04.560 --> 57:08.600]  And again, like so many of these things are hard to report
[57:08.600 --> 57:11.400]  or to minor to report individual problems
[57:11.400 --> 57:12.800]  like through the bug reporter system.
[57:12.800 --> 57:17.920]  And the bug reporter system too is about as hostels it can be.
[57:17.920 --> 57:22.520]  Like if you go to actually report a bug on Apple's bug reporter,
[57:22.520 --> 57:24.080]  you'll be greeted first of all.
[57:24.080 --> 57:26.160]  Is it still iOS 6-themed?
[57:26.160 --> 57:28.520]  I think it is, right?
[57:28.520 --> 57:29.360]  Yeah.
[57:29.360 --> 57:30.360]  So you could be...
[57:30.360 --> 57:33.000]  It's a big improvement over the awkward theme that you still have.
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.280]  Well, they gave it the iOS 6-themed like three days
[57:36.280 --> 57:37.640]  before iOS 7 was unveiled.
[57:37.640 --> 57:38.480]  Remember that?
[57:38.480 --> 57:42.280]  It had, but it had like a 10.0, you know, like when...
[57:42.280 --> 57:43.320]  It was bad.
[57:43.320 --> 57:46.440]  When Aqua was really stripey, it had the big, the pinstripe,
[57:46.440 --> 57:49.040]  horizontal pinstripe, so a long time.
[57:49.040 --> 57:54.360]  And yeah, they updated it to like an iOS 6 look, right
[57:54.360 --> 57:55.840]  before iOS 7 came out.
[57:55.840 --> 57:57.880]  It was like days or weeks before.
[57:57.880 --> 57:58.960]  It was hilarious.
[57:58.960 --> 58:00.680]  Like it was like obviously these two groups weren't talking
[58:00.680 --> 58:03.520]  to each other about that, oh, anyway.
[58:03.520 --> 58:06.640]  So you're greeted with this, you know, this pretty terrible
[58:06.640 --> 58:08.880]  web app, first of all.
[58:08.880 --> 58:12.040]  And then it asks you for like 17 different fields,
[58:12.040 --> 58:14.720]  and then you fill your stuff out, and then you submit it,
[58:14.720 --> 58:16.280]  and they say, all right, thanks.
[58:16.280 --> 58:18.520]  We'll look into it, here's a number.
[58:18.520 --> 58:22.240]  And in most cases, of bugs I've filed, I filed maybe,
[58:22.240 --> 58:26.160]  I don't know, 50 bugs so far in my life with Apple.
[58:26.160 --> 58:28.520]  In almost every case, you will never hear about it again.
[58:28.520 --> 58:30.160]  They won't even tell you if it's a duplicate,
[58:30.160 --> 58:31.240]  they won't even tell you if it's closed,
[58:31.240 --> 58:34.080]  it'll sit there open forever.
[58:34.080 --> 58:39.080]  Sometimes they will tell you after like three months.
[58:39.600 --> 58:41.400]  This is a known bug, it's a duplicated
[58:41.400 --> 58:42.800]  of this other bug ID, thank you.
[58:43.920 --> 58:45.160]  But then you lose all visibility.
[58:45.160 --> 58:47.960]  Then you can't tell when that other bug ID is closed.
[58:47.960 --> 58:50.360]  Like you just, they just basically close your bug,
[58:50.360 --> 58:51.400]  saying, all right, thanks.
[58:51.400 --> 58:53.600]  All right, I just logged into my radar account.
[58:53.600 --> 58:58.600]  And here's one that I filed on the 20th of March, 2009,
[58:58.600 --> 59:02.920]  state open, rank, no value.
[59:02.920 --> 59:04.160]  And it's, here's what I said.
[59:04.160 --> 59:07.320]  I said, when you control, it said, products of farry.
[59:07.320 --> 59:09.720]  When you control, click, right click,
[59:09.720 --> 59:13.040]  on a background tab in Safari 4, you get a menu
[59:13.040 --> 59:15.160]  with options for things like creating a new tab,
[59:15.160 --> 59:17.800]  closing the tab, reloading the tab, and so forth.
[59:17.800 --> 59:19.960]  It would be nice if there were an option
[59:19.960 --> 59:22.160]  to copy the URL for that tab.
[59:22.160 --> 59:24.640]  That way you could copy the URL for a background tab
[59:24.640 --> 59:26.840]  in a background window without either activating
[59:26.840 --> 59:28.880]  that window or that particular tab.
[59:29.920 --> 59:31.520]  I think it's a reasonable request.
[59:31.520 --> 59:33.280]  Right, still, how about saying it's great.
[59:33.280 --> 59:37.280]  But it's the fact that it's just their green open.
[59:37.280 --> 59:39.640]  Yep, still waiting for response from Apple.
[59:39.640 --> 59:43.920]  And that's, and it's, this is not uncommon.
[59:43.920 --> 59:46.120]  This is the common case.
[59:46.120 --> 59:51.320]  I'm not mad that they haven't done it.
[59:51.320 --> 59:52.800]  Actually, let me see.
[59:52.800 --> 59:54.480]  I hope you still can't copy a tab.
[59:54.480 --> 59:56.760]  Nope, it's the same option for those.
[59:56.760 --> 59:58.360]  So I'm not mad that they haven't taken
[59:58.360 --> 59:59.880]  my suggestion and done something.
[59:59.880 --> 1:00:01.800]  But that's what, for everybody in Apple,
[1:00:01.800 --> 1:00:03.360]  it's telling me that's what I should do
[1:00:03.360 --> 1:00:04.360]  with an idea like that.
[1:00:04.360 --> 1:00:06.040]  It's file a radar, right?
[1:00:06.040 --> 1:00:07.600]  Right, but the fact that it's open,
[1:00:07.600 --> 1:00:09.680]  like I wouldn't mind if they just said close,
[1:00:09.680 --> 1:00:10.600]  no, we don't think that,
[1:00:10.600 --> 1:00:12.360]  we don't think copy belongs in that menu.
[1:00:12.360 --> 1:00:15.560]  Okay, you know, thanks for considering the idea.
[1:00:15.560 --> 1:00:18.720]  It's the fact that it looks to me as nobody's ever looked at it.
[1:00:18.720 --> 1:00:20.720]  Right, and which they probably never will
[1:00:20.720 --> 1:00:23.000]  until at some point some internist tasked
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:24.280]  with going through that list
[1:00:24.280 --> 1:00:25.880]  and they just like bulk close them all
[1:00:25.880 --> 1:00:28.320]  or send like a form letter to all of them saying,
[1:00:28.320 --> 1:00:30.120]  all right, you know, is this still a problem?
[1:00:30.120 --> 1:00:33.000]  Please provide a sample project to illustrate the problem.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:33.840]  And then if you don't,
[1:00:33.840 --> 1:00:34.840]  this will automatically close in a day.
[1:00:34.840 --> 1:00:37.240]  Like that's the kind of thing you get.
[1:00:37.240 --> 1:00:40.400]  I mean, it's just, I mean, let's see,
[1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:43.800]  I have, so this is 2011.
[1:00:44.840 --> 1:00:47.680]  I have four bugs here in one of my accounts,
[1:00:47.680 --> 1:00:52.680]  2011, 2011, 2013, all green, no responses.
[1:00:52.680 --> 1:00:54.560]  So this is the problem I have with
[1:00:54.560 --> 1:00:57.440]  the typical Apple answer is,
[1:00:57.440 --> 1:00:59.440]  well, please, you have to file a bug
[1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:01.680]  for any bugs you find or any feature requests you have
[1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:02.520]  or et cetera.
[1:01:03.800 --> 1:01:04.680]  If you're gonna say that,
[1:01:04.680 --> 1:01:07.000]  if that's gonna be your default response,
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:08.680]  this system has to be better.
[1:01:08.680 --> 1:01:11.840]  This system has to be less hostile
[1:01:11.840 --> 1:01:16.560]  and it has to somehow give some kind of satisfactory result.
[1:01:16.560 --> 1:01:20.280]  Even if it's as simple as after like a week,
[1:01:20.280 --> 1:01:22.880]  you say, you know, thanks, we took it into,
[1:01:22.880 --> 1:01:24.120]  we're taking this into consideration
[1:01:24.120 --> 1:01:26.080]  or we're gonna, we'll have somebody look at this
[1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:29.080]  and then close it like some kind of something
[1:01:29.080 --> 1:01:31.840]  that indicates to the person who filed the bug
[1:01:31.840 --> 1:01:34.840]  that it was worth their time to have filed it.
[1:01:34.840 --> 1:01:36.880]  And that's the problem right now, you don't have that.
[1:01:36.880 --> 1:01:41.200]  And so there's no incentive for individuals to file bugs
[1:01:41.200 --> 1:01:44.240]  if you think anyone else will have ever filed the same bug.
[1:01:44.240 --> 1:01:48.040]  Well, there's the adage that insanity is doing the same thing
[1:01:48.040 --> 1:01:49.400]  over the definition of insanity
[1:01:49.400 --> 1:01:51.240]  is doing the same thing over and over and over again
[1:01:51.240 --> 1:01:54.360]  and expecting different results.
[1:01:54.360 --> 1:01:57.400]  And it's, you know, that makes a lot of sense,
[1:01:57.400 --> 1:01:58.240]  it's actually true.
[1:01:58.240 --> 1:02:00.600]  That's to me, it seems almost insane
[1:02:00.600 --> 1:02:05.600]  to keep filing radars when you expecting them
[1:02:05.800 --> 1:02:08.320]  to be dealt with when your experience is,
[1:02:08.320 --> 1:02:09.840]  this is just a waste of my time.
[1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:10.680]  Exactly.
[1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:13.320]  And I've had so many people who work at Apple tell me,
[1:02:13.320 --> 1:02:15.640]  please file radars, they really do matter,
[1:02:15.640 --> 1:02:18.080]  they really do help, please keep filing them.
[1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:19.800]  And they all say too, like they all say
[1:02:19.800 --> 1:02:23.760]  that they get a surprisingly low number of radars filed
[1:02:23.760 --> 1:02:25.800]  for, you know, like you would expect certain things
[1:02:25.800 --> 1:02:26.800]  to have a lot and they say, you know,
[1:02:26.800 --> 1:02:28.680]  certain feature requests or major feature requests
[1:02:28.680 --> 1:02:31.840]  will have like seven radars ever filed on them or something.
[1:02:31.840 --> 1:02:33.880]  But the problem is like, you know,
[1:02:33.880 --> 1:02:36.920]  they're yelling at us saying, please file bugs,
[1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:39.120]  their actions don't back that up.
[1:02:39.120 --> 1:02:41.480]  Like what we see on the outside
[1:02:41.480 --> 1:02:46.080]  is extremely hostile and demotivating.
[1:02:46.080 --> 1:02:47.000]  Yeah, I won't hold that thought
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:47.840]  because I want to come back to that.
[1:02:47.840 --> 1:02:50.640]  But I want to come back to it with a big section,
[1:02:50.640 --> 1:02:52.200]  do a break, but before I take the break,
[1:02:52.200 --> 1:02:54.360]  I just wanted to say another thing too,
[1:02:54.360 --> 1:02:56.400]  was that your article,
[1:02:56.400 --> 1:02:58.160]  the one of the things that had me nodding my head
[1:02:58.160 --> 1:03:02.600]  with your article as sort of, yeah, like now I kind of feel
[1:03:02.600 --> 1:03:06.160]  like one of them being like a Windows user is,
[1:03:06.160 --> 1:03:08.480]  so we've got a laser printer here and it's an HP
[1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:10.000]  and I'm pretty happy with the quality
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:11.760]  and it does Wi-Fi.
[1:03:11.760 --> 1:03:14.040]  Yeah, you're about the same one I did, right?
[1:03:14.040 --> 1:03:19.040]  Maybe I do, it's the CP1525 and W.
[1:03:21.640 --> 1:03:22.680]  Yeah, it's one of HP's wonderful.
[1:03:22.680 --> 1:03:24.360]  Yeah, you asked me what to buy and I told you
[1:03:24.360 --> 1:03:25.200]  to get that one.
[1:03:25.200 --> 1:03:28.720]  Yeah, I did, I did take my usual, just to ask Mark up.
[1:03:28.720 --> 1:03:29.560]  Yeah.
[1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:30.560]  And it exposed the left line.
[1:03:30.560 --> 1:03:31.400]  It works fine.
[1:03:31.400 --> 1:03:33.640]  Well, except when it dies, except when it disappears
[1:03:33.640 --> 1:03:34.480]  from my network for.
[1:03:34.480 --> 1:03:35.320]  And it lies.
[1:03:35.320 --> 1:03:37.880]  Oh, it lies so bad about how much toner it has left.
[1:03:37.880 --> 1:03:39.880]  It lies with a thief in the night.
[1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:42.800]  Mine has been saying it has extremely low supply levels
[1:03:42.800 --> 1:03:46.040]  for about three years and it's still printing just fine.
[1:03:46.040 --> 1:03:48.360]  It is telling me I'm low on color.
[1:03:48.360 --> 1:03:49.600]  I print color.
[1:03:49.600 --> 1:03:51.360]  I swear to God, like once a year Jonas
[1:03:51.360 --> 1:03:53.640]  has like a school project that needs color.
[1:03:53.640 --> 1:03:55.000]  I print everything black and white.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:56.480]  I know you've got plenty of color.
[1:03:56.480 --> 1:03:57.720]  You rely on the bastards.
[1:03:57.720 --> 1:04:00.880]  Anyway, and you know what, with the black,
[1:04:00.880 --> 1:04:02.400]  it told me that I ran out of black
[1:04:02.400 --> 1:04:04.160]  and eventually I really did run out.
[1:04:04.160 --> 1:04:06.360]  But it was telling me, it was like,
[1:04:06.360 --> 1:04:07.200]  give me this error message.
[1:04:07.200 --> 1:04:09.400]  It's like I've got no toner, none, nothing.
[1:04:09.400 --> 1:04:11.720]  And then the paper would come out and it looks great.
[1:04:11.720 --> 1:04:13.040]  It just looks great.
[1:04:13.040 --> 1:04:17.600]  And I know from working as student newspapers
[1:04:17.600 --> 1:04:20.400]  and doing print graphic design for years before,
[1:04:20.400 --> 1:04:22.680]  I know what low toner looks like.
[1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:23.600]  It's pretty obvious.
[1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:25.120]  It's not a subtle change.
[1:04:25.120 --> 1:04:28.120]  Like it's like, yeah, when your printer's
[1:04:28.120 --> 1:04:30.760]  actually ran out of toner, it looks like it.
[1:04:30.760 --> 1:04:32.720]  Yeah, it's right there, right in your face.
[1:04:32.720 --> 1:04:34.320]  It looks exactly what it sounds like.
[1:04:34.320 --> 1:04:36.200]  It's like, wow, I can hardly read this.
[1:04:36.200 --> 1:04:37.400]  The letters are almost-
[1:04:37.400 --> 1:04:38.760]  Right, everything's all spotted.
[1:04:38.760 --> 1:04:40.640]  And yeah, you could definitely tell.
[1:04:40.640 --> 1:04:43.880]  Anyway, it exposes itself over Bonjour.
[1:04:43.880 --> 1:04:46.760]  And so, yeah, I don't know.
[1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:50.480]  But so, that set it up is really kind of easy.
[1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:51.920]  And I'm gonna have to say,
[1:04:51.920 --> 1:04:53.640]  and going back even further,
[1:04:53.640 --> 1:04:54.520]  the thing that cracked me up
[1:04:54.520 --> 1:04:55.800]  about the business insider headline
[1:04:55.800 --> 1:04:57.840]  is calling you a long time Mac user.
[1:04:57.840 --> 1:04:59.480]  Or a long time Apple supporter?
[1:04:59.480 --> 1:05:00.400]  I don't know.
[1:05:00.400 --> 1:05:02.520]  It's like anybody joined the team in 2003.
[1:05:02.520 --> 1:05:03.760]  You're not a long time.
[1:05:03.760 --> 1:05:07.080]  2004, I was using Windows in 2005.
[1:05:07.080 --> 1:05:09.080]  Like I was using them both for a while.
[1:05:09.080 --> 1:05:11.880]  One of the things that was never as good on Mac OS X
[1:05:11.880 --> 1:05:14.400]  as classic Mac OS was setting up printers.
[1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:15.720]  Like in the old days,
[1:05:15.720 --> 1:05:18.720]  because it used to be that you had to get like an Apple printer,
[1:05:18.720 --> 1:05:20.280]  like either one from Apple,
[1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:22.680]  Apple believe it or not used to make printers,
[1:05:22.680 --> 1:05:25.800]  or like some kind of Apple compatible printer.
[1:05:25.800 --> 1:05:27.440]  But it always just worked.
[1:05:27.440 --> 1:05:31.440]  It was the, maybe one of the canonical examples
[1:05:31.440 --> 1:05:33.160]  of the differences between Apple's,
[1:05:33.160 --> 1:05:36.440]  it just works experience and the PC world.
[1:05:36.440 --> 1:05:37.800]  You never had to worry about drivers,
[1:05:37.800 --> 1:05:38.640]  anything like that.
[1:05:38.640 --> 1:05:39.880]  You just plug it in.
[1:05:39.880 --> 1:05:40.720]  There it is.
[1:05:40.720 --> 1:05:41.880]  It shows up in your chooser.
[1:05:41.880 --> 1:05:44.160]  You pick the printer and boom, it works.
[1:05:44.160 --> 1:05:47.000]  Like just, it was never a problem.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:49.880]  And in Mac OS X, I thought that just got worse.
[1:05:49.880 --> 1:05:53.120]  And it was sort of the shift to industry standard printers
[1:05:53.120 --> 1:05:58.120]  and short of just the that those underpinnings of next
[1:05:59.120 --> 1:06:02.400]  were never as hooked up to like the print world
[1:06:02.400 --> 1:06:04.560]  as Apple's classic Mac OS was.
[1:06:04.560 --> 1:06:06.360]  But anyway, it got better for a while.
[1:06:06.360 --> 1:06:09.560]  This printer, when I first got, it was great.
[1:06:09.560 --> 1:06:12.720]  It's you go to the printer thing and system preferences.
[1:06:12.720 --> 1:06:14.120]  And there it is listed.
[1:06:14.120 --> 1:06:15.560]  You hit plus, there it is, listed.
[1:06:15.560 --> 1:06:16.920]  It's like, here's a bone cure printer.
[1:06:16.920 --> 1:06:17.840]  Is this the one you want?
[1:06:17.840 --> 1:06:18.800]  Yes, there it is.
[1:06:20.200 --> 1:06:22.760]  Just the last week, I went to print something.
[1:06:22.760 --> 1:06:27.040]  And it, you know, and I had, it's the only printer I have,
[1:06:27.040 --> 1:06:29.960]  the only printer I used, I hadn't changed it.
[1:06:29.960 --> 1:06:30.920]  And it just said it, you know,
[1:06:30.920 --> 1:06:32.960]  printer can't be reached or something.
[1:06:32.960 --> 1:06:34.720]  And nothing would, it just wouldn't come out.
[1:06:34.720 --> 1:06:37.200]  Like it was just the jobs were queuing up
[1:06:37.200 --> 1:06:38.960]  in that thing in the dock.
[1:06:38.960 --> 1:06:41.040]  So I deleted it, I deleted the printer
[1:06:41.040 --> 1:06:44.520]  and I went to re-add it and it wasn't even listed.
[1:06:44.520 --> 1:06:46.040]  And in the old, and I, you know what I did,
[1:06:46.040 --> 1:06:48.440]  I just thought I'll screw it, I'll print from Amy's.
[1:06:48.440 --> 1:06:50.800]  And I like, went to, emailed it to Amy
[1:06:50.800 --> 1:06:54.400]  and printed from Amy's computer and it worked.
[1:06:54.400 --> 1:06:56.360]  And I just left it at that.
[1:06:56.360 --> 1:06:58.400]  And I realized when I read your article
[1:06:58.400 --> 1:07:01.880]  that in the old days like three, four, five years ago,
[1:07:01.880 --> 1:07:03.560]  when I, I would have instantly thought
[1:07:03.560 --> 1:07:05.880]  it's gotta be the printer and went upstairs
[1:07:05.880 --> 1:07:07.920]  and just turned the printer on and off.
[1:07:07.920 --> 1:07:09.760]  And in fact, that actually worked.
[1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:12.120]  I did, you know, at, it was your article
[1:07:12.120 --> 1:07:12.960]  that made me test it.
[1:07:12.960 --> 1:07:14.840]  I went up, turned the printer off, turned it back on
[1:07:14.840 --> 1:07:16.960]  and then boom, it just worked.
[1:07:16.960 --> 1:07:18.200]  Reconnecting it to my Mac.
[1:07:18.200 --> 1:07:19.760]  So it was the printer's fault.
[1:07:19.760 --> 1:07:21.320]  But in the old days, I would have just assumed
[1:07:21.320 --> 1:07:22.200]  it was the printer's fault.
[1:07:22.200 --> 1:07:24.280]  Whereas now I thought, screw it,
[1:07:24.280 --> 1:07:25.880]  something's wrong with Yosemite.
[1:07:27.200 --> 1:07:30.200]  I think, well, I've had the, the same issue.
[1:07:30.200 --> 1:07:32.120]  And it's, it's like I have the same issue
[1:07:32.120 --> 1:07:35.800]  with other Yosemite Macs that are on the network.
[1:07:35.800 --> 1:07:37.680]  So I think it's an issue with, like,
[1:07:37.680 --> 1:07:41.280]  with Yosemite losing its, its connection to the printer,
[1:07:41.280 --> 1:07:42.840]  like losing its discovery of the printer.
[1:07:42.840 --> 1:07:46.240]  Like, so Yosemite, they, they rewrote some part
[1:07:46.240 --> 1:07:47.480]  of the networking stack.
[1:07:47.480 --> 1:07:49.200]  I don't know the details, but they,
[1:07:49.200 --> 1:07:50.880]  they basically combined some of the discovery
[1:07:50.880 --> 1:07:54.000]  and, and that related stuff into this new thing
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:55.480]  called Discovery D.
[1:07:55.480 --> 1:07:56.320]  Yes.
[1:07:56.320 --> 1:08:00.120]  And, and people keep reporting a lot of Wi-Fi
[1:08:00.120 --> 1:08:02.840]  and network discovery issues with Yosemite,
[1:08:02.840 --> 1:08:04.280]  it's probably related to that
[1:08:04.280 --> 1:08:05.520]  because they changed a bunch of that
[1:08:05.520 --> 1:08:07.720]  to enable things like continuity and hand off
[1:08:07.720 --> 1:08:08.560]  and stuff like that.
[1:08:08.560 --> 1:08:10.320]  And I urge her off to the mat, like between the two.
[1:08:10.320 --> 1:08:13.320]  So that stuff all changed in Yosemite.
[1:08:13.320 --> 1:08:14.840]  So that's most likely the source of the problem.
[1:08:14.840 --> 1:08:17.840]  So my, my Spidey sense that it was Yosemite probably is right.
[1:08:17.840 --> 1:08:20.200]  It's just the solution of turning the printer off
[1:08:20.200 --> 1:08:23.080]  and on, probably isn't even HP's fault.
[1:08:23.080 --> 1:08:24.320]  It, no, it almost certainly isn't.
[1:08:24.320 --> 1:08:25.520]  Cause like I had the same problem
[1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:27.400]  with every Mac on the network.
[1:08:27.400 --> 1:08:31.800]  You know, I believe a lot of networking problems in, in general.
[1:08:31.800 --> 1:08:33.960]  And like again, not one networking issue,
[1:08:33.960 --> 1:08:35.360]  but just, you know,
[1:08:35.360 --> 1:08:36.560]  how can Barry's description of it
[1:08:36.560 --> 1:08:38.600]  as a thousand paper cuts is exactly right?
[1:08:38.600 --> 1:08:40.840]  Is a big chunk of them seem to be networking.
[1:08:40.840 --> 1:08:41.880]  And networking is hard.
[1:08:41.880 --> 1:08:44.080]  I mean, like, you know, this is like,
[1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:46.160]  as you said earlier, like, like I don't,
[1:08:46.160 --> 1:08:48.840]  like we know Apple has great people working for them.
[1:08:48.840 --> 1:08:51.680]  We know that these aren't idiots doing this.
[1:08:51.680 --> 1:08:54.120]  But, you know, the fact is like, you know,
[1:08:54.120 --> 1:08:57.200]  my point in the piece was they're doing too much
[1:08:57.200 --> 1:08:58.640]  and it's really starting to show like it,
[1:08:58.640 --> 1:09:02.840]  it always feels like we're using like a 1.0 release
[1:09:02.840 --> 1:09:03.680]  or a beta.
[1:09:03.680 --> 1:09:07.640]  Like there used to be some kind of stability
[1:09:07.640 --> 1:09:10.720]  between betas and the GMs.
[1:09:10.720 --> 1:09:11.840]  It was never perfect.
[1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:14.160]  But there used to be like a differentiator like,
[1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:16.320]  okay, well stuff's gonna stop changing
[1:09:16.320 --> 1:09:19.040]  right before the GM by some interval of time.
[1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:22.000]  And the GM will be a higher degree of quality
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:23.280]  than the betas were.
[1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:25.720]  And then a couple revisions down the line
[1:09:25.720 --> 1:09:28.480]  once you have like a 0.3, 0.4 kind of range,
[1:09:28.480 --> 1:09:30.440]  it'll be really stable for the next, you know,
[1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:32.840]  year and a half until they release a new major version.
[1:09:32.840 --> 1:09:34.520]  If you treat it, it used to be, I think,
[1:09:34.520 --> 1:09:36.160]  for a number of years.
[1:09:36.160 --> 1:09:37.880]  And I would say it probably covers the years,
[1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:39.360]  your early years on the platform.
[1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:44.360]  Like that 2004 to 2008ish, nineish period.
[1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:48.680]  If you just had the conservative patients
[1:09:48.680 --> 1:09:52.520]  to treat every release as like minus one,
[1:09:52.520 --> 1:09:53.600]  you'd do pretty well.
[1:09:53.600 --> 1:09:57.640]  So in other words, trust that the betas are gonna suck.
[1:09:57.640 --> 1:10:00.640]  And trust that the GM is really just a beta.
[1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:04.680]  And then trust that the 1.0 release of the OS
[1:10:04.680 --> 1:10:07.160]  is really like a public beta.
[1:10:07.160 --> 1:10:10.920]  And wait for like the first major public update
[1:10:10.920 --> 1:10:14.920]  after the 1.0, you know, after system,
[1:10:14.920 --> 1:10:17.080]  you know, iOS 5.0 ships.
[1:10:17.080 --> 1:10:20.320]  Wait for 5.01 or maybe 5.02.
[1:10:20.320 --> 1:10:23.520]  And you'll have a really solid OS.
[1:10:23.520 --> 1:10:27.120]  Exactly. And these days, it feels like we never reach
[1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:32.120]  that point of like a few point X's in and now it's stable.
[1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:37.360]  Like now we're always in the beta 1.0, 1.1 loop, it seems.
[1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:39.200]  And I know like, you know, technically version wise,
[1:10:39.200 --> 1:10:41.400]  they've passed 1.1 with some of these.
[1:10:41.400 --> 1:10:44.160]  But like it just seems like we,
[1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:48.400]  and the GM seem so minimally different
[1:10:48.400 --> 1:10:50.040]  from the betas in terms of quality,
[1:10:50.040 --> 1:10:51.680]  like even worse than they used to be.
[1:10:51.680 --> 1:10:53.240]  Like it seems like we're just always in beta now.
[1:10:53.240 --> 1:10:56.560]  Seems like they only get around to fixing the crashes,
[1:10:56.560 --> 1:10:57.560]  you know, the big ones.
[1:10:57.560 --> 1:10:59.240]  And they never get around to the cleanup.
[1:10:59.240 --> 1:11:03.080]  And it's guy English's point that the annual cycle means
[1:11:03.080 --> 1:11:05.000]  that, and you know, we're probably hitting that point
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.520]  right now where a lot of engineering talent at Apple
[1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:12.520]  is probably going towards the WDC releases of what I,
[1:11:14.080 --> 1:11:19.080]  you know, our am guessing will be iOS 9 and system 10.11.
[1:11:19.080 --> 1:11:22.040]  Yeah. And system 10.11.
[1:11:22.040 --> 1:11:24.040]  Exactly. Like this cycle,
[1:11:24.040 --> 1:11:27.600]  it doesn't leave time for stability really.
[1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:30.520]  It doesn't leave time for all those boring little bug fixes
[1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:32.520]  to be applied to the old ancient version
[1:11:32.520 --> 1:11:33.680]  that we're all still using,
[1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:35.960]  because it nothing ever gets that old.
[1:11:35.960 --> 1:11:37.280]  Yeah.
[1:11:37.280 --> 1:11:40.520]  Let me take a break and thank our second sponsor.
[1:11:40.520 --> 1:11:42.480]  And it is your and my,
[1:11:42.480 --> 1:11:46.120]  everybody's very good friends at Squarespace.
[1:11:46.120 --> 1:11:49.240]  You guys know Squarespace, it's the all in one platform
[1:11:49.240 --> 1:11:54.160]  where you can host, build, design, create your website.
[1:11:54.160 --> 1:11:56.560]  You need a website, you go to Squarespace
[1:11:56.560 --> 1:11:59.000]  and you have a website.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  It's that easy.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:01.280]  You get to pick your domain name,
[1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:03.760]  you get to pick from a bunch,
[1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:06.600]  including a whole bunch of new ones, themes.
[1:12:06.600 --> 1:12:11.600]  You get to edit the content right there in your website.
[1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:14.640]  When you're logged in, you can just drag the stuff around,
[1:12:14.640 --> 1:12:16.760]  add the components you want.
[1:12:16.760 --> 1:12:18.480]  So many presets to choose from.
[1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:22.680]  And they have a brand new Squarespace seven.
[1:12:22.680 --> 1:12:23.720]  That's the latest version.
[1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:26.600]  You can go to squarespace.com slash seven,
[1:12:26.600 --> 1:12:29.880]  spell it out like the movie, SEVEN,
[1:12:29.880 --> 1:12:31.080]  and see all the new stuff.
[1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:31.920]  Because you guys know,
[1:12:31.920 --> 1:12:33.200]  we talk about Squarespace all the time
[1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:34.800]  the sponsor shows for years.
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:36.960]  So you're familiar with it.
[1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:39.640]  Go to that, what URL slash seven at their site
[1:12:39.640 --> 1:12:40.800]  and find out the new stuff.
[1:12:40.800 --> 1:12:41.800]  But at the highlights,
[1:12:41.800 --> 1:12:43.720]  they've got integration with Google Apps
[1:12:43.720 --> 1:12:45.560]  that's huge for people who are using this
[1:12:45.560 --> 1:12:49.280]  with companies that use Google Apps.
[1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:52.960]  They've redesigned their whole interface.
[1:12:52.960 --> 1:12:55.080]  They have a partnership with Getty Images now
[1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:58.840]  so you can get stock photos and images right there
[1:12:58.840 --> 1:13:03.000]  from within the Squarespace interface, new templates,
[1:13:03.920 --> 1:13:06.440]  things like cover pages so you can have like a splash screen,
[1:13:06.440 --> 1:13:07.720]  splash screens or back.
[1:13:09.080 --> 1:13:11.760]  And probably best of all, the best thing that they have,
[1:13:11.760 --> 1:13:13.040]  I think isn't even technical.
[1:13:13.040 --> 1:13:15.840]  It's their tech support 24 seven.
[1:13:15.840 --> 1:13:17.920]  All hours, all days,
[1:13:17.920 --> 1:13:20.680]  you can get tech support via live chat and email.
[1:13:21.640 --> 1:13:24.960]  And the whole thing, it starts at eight bucks a month.
[1:13:24.960 --> 1:13:25.960]  You just can't lose.
[1:13:27.640 --> 1:13:29.400]  And you get,
[1:13:30.960 --> 1:13:33.160]  I forget how much, I don't know, what is it a month?
[1:13:33.160 --> 1:13:34.440]  What do you get a month free?
[1:13:34.440 --> 1:13:35.280]  The trial?
[1:13:35.280 --> 1:13:36.280]  Yeah, they don't even tell you.
[1:13:36.280 --> 1:13:37.120]  Yeah, they don't even tell you.
[1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:39.120]  You start, I think it starts out as a week,
[1:13:39.120 --> 1:13:41.520]  but then like when you hit that week,
[1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:42.440]  they'll send you an email saying,
[1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:43.720]  hey, do you want more time?
[1:13:43.720 --> 1:13:44.680]  And you just click a link
[1:13:44.680 --> 1:13:45.840]  and they give you like another week.
[1:13:45.840 --> 1:13:48.520]  Yeah, that's how confident they are
[1:13:48.520 --> 1:13:49.800]  that you're gonna stick with it
[1:13:49.800 --> 1:13:52.680]  because once your free trial's over eventually,
[1:13:54.280 --> 1:13:56.800]  you're gonna be like, I'd be nuts to leave, this is great.
[1:13:56.800 --> 1:13:58.720]  You do it with no credit card required,
[1:13:58.720 --> 1:14:03.760]  just go there and start creating a website free.
[1:14:03.760 --> 1:14:06.520]  So URL to know that they came from the show
[1:14:06.520 --> 1:14:09.400]  is squarespace.com slash Gruber
[1:14:09.400 --> 1:14:14.400]  and the code when you sign up is my initials, JG.
[1:14:15.040 --> 1:14:16.920]  I don't know why they don't match up,
[1:14:16.920 --> 1:14:18.880]  but it's that code that you need.
[1:14:18.880 --> 1:14:19.880]  You need to keep that in mind
[1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:21.240]  because it really doesn't matter what you do
[1:14:21.240 --> 1:14:22.080]  when you sign up.
[1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:23.280]  Go there, just go to squarespace.com
[1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:25.280]  and sign up because you're gonna get a free trial.
[1:14:25.280 --> 1:14:27.840]  You'd be, why pay, take the free trial and start.
[1:14:27.840 --> 1:14:29.040]  It's when the free trial's over,
[1:14:29.040 --> 1:14:31.560]  you gotta remember the code JG.
[1:14:31.560 --> 1:14:34.320]  And when you use that code, you'll save 10%.
[1:14:34.320 --> 1:14:36.880]  So not only will you help support the show,
[1:14:36.880 --> 1:14:38.440]  but you'll save some of your own money as well.
[1:14:38.440 --> 1:14:39.880]  So my thanks to Squarespace,
[1:14:40.840 --> 1:14:41.880]  if you need a website,
[1:14:41.880 --> 1:14:44.040]  you're nuts, if you don't look at Squarespace first.
[1:14:45.480 --> 1:14:47.680]  That's my new slogan for Squarespace.
[1:14:47.680 --> 1:14:48.840]  I could have you do all my ad for each,
[1:14:48.840 --> 1:14:49.680]  something better out there.
[1:14:49.680 --> 1:14:51.200]  I like yours, I like the one,
[1:14:51.200 --> 1:14:54.360]  because you actually had this story about your kid's school
[1:14:54.360 --> 1:14:56.440]  where the preschool or whatever,
[1:14:56.440 --> 1:14:59.440]  and they were gonna spend $7,000 on a website.
[1:14:59.440 --> 1:15:01.520]  I think it was three, it was three or 3,500.
[1:15:01.520 --> 1:15:04.440]  I don't know if anybody knows,
[1:15:04.440 --> 1:15:07.400]  there is not a, schools don't have money to burn,
[1:15:07.400 --> 1:15:10.080]  it's like a little co-op preschool,
[1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:13.400]  like this is not a, like they don't have money.
[1:15:13.400 --> 1:15:16.800]  It is like the kudos to you for being an involved parent
[1:15:16.800 --> 1:15:18.400]  at the school, but you were like,
[1:15:18.400 --> 1:15:20.160]  will you give me like two days?
[1:15:20.160 --> 1:15:21.000]  Yeah.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:25.760]  But you took like two days and build them a website,
[1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:29.880]  and now they pay $8 a month.
[1:15:29.880 --> 1:15:31.680]  Yeah, instead of $3,000.
[1:15:31.680 --> 1:15:33.720]  Which, for a website, let's face it,
[1:15:33.720 --> 1:15:35.960]  we who knows who they were gonna pay the 3,500 too,
[1:15:35.960 --> 1:15:38.320]  but you know what, it was probably gonna suck.
[1:15:38.320 --> 1:15:40.640]  Anyway, I love that story, that was great.
[1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:42.440]  Yeah, it's actually a clear win for Squaresman.
[1:15:42.440 --> 1:15:44.520]  And now, and like, I'm not even the person
[1:15:44.520 --> 1:15:46.280]  who's responsible for keeping the website updated.
[1:15:46.280 --> 1:15:47.960]  Somebody else does that,
[1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:51.160]  and so it's important to like have something that they can use
[1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:53.200]  that isn't like my crappy CMS
[1:15:53.200 --> 1:15:55.520]  or some really complicated WordPress install,
[1:15:55.520 --> 1:15:57.320]  and then if they need support,
[1:15:57.320 --> 1:15:58.800]  I'm not their tech support,
[1:15:58.800 --> 1:16:00.040]  Squarespace their tech support.
[1:16:00.040 --> 1:16:01.320]  Yeah, like I totally out of it,
[1:16:01.320 --> 1:16:04.080]  like I did my job, my job is done, my hands are clean,
[1:16:04.080 --> 1:16:06.360]  and it's all like their system now
[1:16:06.360 --> 1:16:07.920]  that they can do whatever they want to,
[1:16:07.920 --> 1:16:08.800]  and when they have a question,
[1:16:08.800 --> 1:16:10.360]  they can get support from Squarespace and not me,
[1:16:10.360 --> 1:16:11.200]  it's perfect.
[1:16:11.200 --> 1:16:14.240]  Yeah, 10 years ago, that same story might have been
[1:16:14.240 --> 1:16:16.160]  that you would have said, hey, hey,
[1:16:16.160 --> 1:16:20.120]  and then go sign them up for like an $8 a month hosting account
[1:16:20.120 --> 1:16:22.680]  and put up an install of WordPress,
[1:16:22.680 --> 1:16:24.440]  and pick a theme and do this,
[1:16:24.440 --> 1:16:26.000]  and get like mostly the same thing,
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:27.120]  but that's your exactly right though.
[1:16:27.120 --> 1:16:28.760]  Then like six months later,
[1:16:28.760 --> 1:16:30.040]  and you're reading tech meme,
[1:16:30.040 --> 1:16:32.800]  and there's like a big vulnerability and WordPress
[1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:34.440]  that was exposed, and you're like,
[1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:37.720]  I don't think that's cool, there's no way they know.
[1:16:37.720 --> 1:16:38.560]  And it's on you,
[1:16:38.560 --> 1:16:41.320]  like whether you just like silently whistle
[1:16:41.320 --> 1:16:42.520]  and let the school keep going,
[1:16:42.520 --> 1:16:45.200]  or whether now you're permanently on the hook
[1:16:45.200 --> 1:16:47.960]  for being like the guy who's gonna fix it.
[1:16:47.960 --> 1:16:50.120]  Or they're like, hey, we want to add another widget
[1:16:50.120 --> 1:16:51.760]  to the sidebar, can you do that for us,
[1:16:51.760 --> 1:16:54.000]  because there's no clear way for them to do it.
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:55.640]  Stuff like that, it's just,
[1:16:55.640 --> 1:16:58.160]  it's so much better to just outsource this to Squarespace
[1:16:58.160 --> 1:16:59.000]  and stuff.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:00.440]  The other thing I love about that anecdote of yours
[1:17:00.440 --> 1:17:02.920]  is I feel like it perfectly exemplifies
[1:17:02.920 --> 1:17:05.360]  why Squarespace advertises the way that they do,
[1:17:05.360 --> 1:17:08.480]  that the way that they advertise over and over and over again
[1:17:08.480 --> 1:17:11.240]  on shows like ours, never used to make sense to me,
[1:17:11.240 --> 1:17:14.280]  but I think it's so that, you know,
[1:17:14.280 --> 1:17:16.680]  how many people really need to make a website right now?
[1:17:16.680 --> 1:17:17.520]  Who knows?
[1:17:17.520 --> 1:17:18.360]  Probably very few.
[1:17:18.360 --> 1:17:20.600]  But how many over the course of the next year
[1:17:20.600 --> 1:17:22.240]  are gonna find themselves in a situation
[1:17:22.240 --> 1:17:23.600]  where they do need to make a website?
[1:17:23.600 --> 1:17:25.520]  And at that moment, if they get first thing,
[1:17:25.520 --> 1:17:28.200]  they think of a Squarespace, boom, they go there.
[1:17:28.200 --> 1:17:31.400]  Exactly, yeah, I think it works out very well for them that way.
[1:17:31.400 --> 1:17:32.960]  All right, it's not about needing a website
[1:17:32.960 --> 1:17:34.160]  while you're listening to it on the show.
[1:17:34.160 --> 1:17:36.600]  It's seeding it in your mind so that when you hit
[1:17:36.600 --> 1:17:40.480]  that situation where your school wants to spend $4,000
[1:17:40.480 --> 1:17:44.920]  on a website that you say, no, do you don't do that?
[1:17:46.560 --> 1:17:48.760]  I wanna go back to what you were talking about.
[1:17:48.760 --> 1:17:52.040]  And here's the, I have this in my notes here for the show
[1:17:52.040 --> 1:17:53.520]  and talk about dev relations.
[1:17:53.520 --> 1:17:56.880]  And I think it's a big part of the problem
[1:17:56.880 --> 1:17:58.840]  that we're talking about here.
[1:17:58.840 --> 1:18:03.840]  And I think Apple's developer relations is overwhelmed.
[1:18:05.200 --> 1:18:06.480]  Now, I don't know the numbers.
[1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:08.440]  And so it's a ballpark figure.
[1:18:09.720 --> 1:18:13.000]  But for talking with somebody at Apple,
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:17.520]  they're rough estimate is that Microsoft's
[1:18:17.520 --> 1:18:20.800]  developer relations team is somewhere
[1:18:20.800 --> 1:18:24.480]  in between 10 and 50 times larger than Apple's.
[1:18:24.480 --> 1:18:26.200]  And I would say the 50.
[1:18:26.200 --> 1:18:29.040]  And he was like, yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.
[1:18:29.040 --> 1:18:31.080]  And if you're like a serious,
[1:18:31.080 --> 1:18:32.280]  and you might know more about this idea,
[1:18:32.280 --> 1:18:33.200]  I've never been it.
[1:18:33.200 --> 1:18:37.200]  I've never written a goddamn line of code for windows.
[1:18:37.200 --> 1:18:42.040]  But the basic idea is if you're a professional developer
[1:18:42.040 --> 1:18:44.280]  and doing some kind of serious work on windows,
[1:18:44.280 --> 1:18:48.400]  you can get the attention of somebody competent
[1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:52.080]  and who can get stuff done on their developer relations team.
[1:18:52.080 --> 1:18:54.320]  And so if you're being driven up the wall
[1:18:54.320 --> 1:18:56.880]  by the sub-scure bug in a framework,
[1:18:58.680 --> 1:19:00.880]  you may not get a solution right away.
[1:19:00.880 --> 1:19:05.880]  And you certainly may not get a version of Windows release
[1:19:06.040 --> 1:19:08.240]  that has a fix for it right away.
[1:19:08.240 --> 1:19:10.520]  But you can at least get somebody's attention
[1:19:10.520 --> 1:19:13.800]  to get it in front of the right people.
[1:19:13.800 --> 1:19:16.480]  And it doesn't feel like when you're reporting things
[1:19:16.480 --> 1:19:18.760]  to Microsoft, it doesn't feel like you're
[1:19:20.680 --> 1:19:23.120]  just filing things into a black hole.
[1:19:23.120 --> 1:19:26.560]  And that Apple's developer relations,
[1:19:26.560 --> 1:19:27.840]  not that they're not well-meaning,
[1:19:27.840 --> 1:19:29.400]  but that they're just overwhelmed,
[1:19:29.400 --> 1:19:31.360]  absolutely positively overwhelmed.
[1:19:31.360 --> 1:19:36.360]  And it's like Microsoft Developer Relations team
[1:19:36.600 --> 1:19:40.480]  is of a size that is appropriate for a company
[1:19:40.480 --> 1:19:44.400]  that had and saw as its rightful place
[1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:49.240]  that 90% of all software in the world is written for it.
[1:19:49.240 --> 1:19:52.440]  And Apple's developer relations is still of a scale,
[1:19:52.440 --> 1:19:55.640]  of a company that has like three or four percent
[1:19:55.640 --> 1:19:56.920]  of the software in the world.
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:19:59.920]  Well, also like the whole structure
[1:19:59.920 --> 1:20:02.320]  of how it's set up with the public
[1:20:02.320 --> 1:20:06.080]  or with the developers is radically different.
[1:20:06.080 --> 1:20:07.440]  Now, I don't know how Microsoft is set up,
[1:20:07.440 --> 1:20:12.440]  but the way Apple's is set up is fairly hostile at first.
[1:20:13.760 --> 1:20:17.680]  Like Apple appears to be this brick wall
[1:20:17.680 --> 1:20:20.040]  that you have no way in.
[1:20:20.040 --> 1:20:23.320]  Like there is no where on, as far as I know,
[1:20:23.320 --> 1:20:27.120]  I don't think there's like a list or an email address
[1:20:27.120 --> 1:20:29.920]  to say, hey, ask a developer evangelist a question.
[1:20:29.920 --> 1:20:34.120]  So I just searched, I've always wondered like,
[1:20:34.120 --> 1:20:35.640]  is there a public list anywhere
[1:20:35.640 --> 1:20:39.120]  of who the Apple evangelists even are?
[1:20:39.120 --> 1:20:42.360]  And if you search Google for Apple developer evangelists,
[1:20:42.360 --> 1:20:45.400]  nowhere on the first page is anything from Apple,
[1:20:45.400 --> 1:20:48.160]  there's a GitHub gist where somebody else,
[1:20:48.160 --> 1:20:51.920]  some random person just compiled the list from WVDC
[1:20:51.920 --> 1:20:55.480]  and there's a bunch of question marks on it too.
[1:20:57.720 --> 1:21:01.080]  Like this, every year, WVDC,
[1:21:02.400 --> 1:21:05.240]  you can always tell again in the first few days,
[1:21:05.240 --> 1:21:07.480]  if you look around some of the bigger sessions,
[1:21:07.480 --> 1:21:11.200]  the very last slide they will show the presenter's name,
[1:21:11.200 --> 1:21:13.800]  their email address, and their title.
[1:21:14.720 --> 1:21:17.720]  That is usually the first time you see their title,
[1:21:17.720 --> 1:21:19.600]  it is almost certainly the first time you see their email
[1:21:19.600 --> 1:21:21.360]  address, and you look around the room
[1:21:21.360 --> 1:21:23.800]  and when that slides on screen for about eight seconds,
[1:21:23.800 --> 1:21:26.480]  and you see half the room racing to write down
[1:21:26.480 --> 1:21:27.320]  that email address.
[1:21:27.320 --> 1:21:28.280]  Take in pictures of it.
[1:21:28.280 --> 1:21:31.880]  Yeah, I've noticed that in recent years now
[1:21:31.880 --> 1:21:33.120]  that maybe it has an iPhone.
[1:21:33.120 --> 1:21:37.120]  Yeah, yeah, because like, that's like the first time
[1:21:37.120 --> 1:21:38.720]  that most people see like, oh my God,
[1:21:38.720 --> 1:21:41.160]  there's an email address with somebody who works in Apple
[1:21:41.160 --> 1:21:43.720]  in the developer group somewhere that I can contact.
[1:21:43.720 --> 1:21:46.280]  Plus I think people worry rightfully
[1:21:46.280 --> 1:21:49.360]  that they want to write it down and get a picture of it now
[1:21:49.360 --> 1:21:51.080]  because who knows if they're gonna cut it out
[1:21:51.080 --> 1:21:53.640]  of the published version of the video.
[1:21:53.640 --> 1:21:55.480]  Because they cut a lot out of those videos.
[1:21:55.480 --> 1:21:56.320]  Right.
[1:21:56.320 --> 1:21:59.200]  They cut mistakes out, who knows if they cut out laughter
[1:21:59.200 --> 1:22:00.840]  and applause, they cut out a lot.
[1:22:00.840 --> 1:22:03.120]  Like if all of a sudden, this guy gets overwhelmed
[1:22:03.120 --> 1:22:05.440]  with email, maybe they're gonna take his email out.
[1:22:05.440 --> 1:22:07.480]  So you better get it down while you can't.
[1:22:07.480 --> 1:22:10.320]  I know exactly what you're talking about.
[1:22:10.320 --> 1:22:11.840]  Right, and that's weird.
[1:22:11.840 --> 1:22:16.200]  Like if these people's job is to interact with the public,
[1:22:16.200 --> 1:22:17.400]  with the developers at least,
[1:22:17.400 --> 1:22:19.440]  with the developer public about these frameworks
[1:22:19.440 --> 1:22:21.600]  and these areas of development,
[1:22:21.600 --> 1:22:23.520]  there's no list on Apple's site anywhere
[1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:25.640]  that lists them like, that's weird, isn't it?
[1:22:25.640 --> 1:22:28.720]  I don't think that it's malice.
[1:22:28.720 --> 1:22:30.480]  I don't think it's that they don't mean well.
[1:22:30.480 --> 1:22:32.840]  And in fact, the people I know in Apple developed relations
[1:22:32.840 --> 1:22:35.000]  for the most part are great people.
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:36.760]  And at least I've never met anybody who's like,
[1:22:36.760 --> 1:22:37.960]  I would call unpleasant.
[1:22:37.960 --> 1:22:39.560]  I would say really sharp.
[1:22:39.560 --> 1:22:41.880]  I think that they are overwhelmed though.
[1:22:41.880 --> 1:22:44.520]  I think that they, I'm sure they've staffed up somewhat.
[1:22:44.520 --> 1:22:48.080]  But I think for the most part, they're of a basic magnitude
[1:22:48.080 --> 1:22:52.160]  that was appropriate for Apple 10, 15 years ago.
[1:22:52.160 --> 1:22:53.000]  Yeah.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:57.480]  And now they're one of, if not the most popular developer
[1:22:57.480 --> 1:23:00.440]  platform in the world and they're just overwhelmed.
[1:23:00.440 --> 1:23:02.440]  Again, the number that I heard from somebody,
[1:23:02.440 --> 1:23:04.600]  again, a rough estimate, but that Microsoft's team
[1:23:04.600 --> 1:23:08.360]  is 10 to 50 times larger.
[1:23:08.360 --> 1:23:10.040]  Yeah, I mean, it's a entirely different matter.
[1:23:10.040 --> 1:23:13.080]  And this list on GitHub of who the evangelists are at Apple
[1:23:13.080 --> 1:23:14.440]  has like 12 people on it.
[1:23:14.440 --> 1:23:16.200]  And it's a pretty small list.
[1:23:18.240 --> 1:23:20.800]  So, and like, and you know, they are, you know,
[1:23:20.800 --> 1:23:23.480]  if there were one that would explain a lot because,
[1:23:23.480 --> 1:23:27.840]  you know, even like there's developer relations managers
[1:23:27.840 --> 1:23:29.760]  or representatives, like people will say,
[1:23:29.760 --> 1:23:32.520]  oh, let's talk to a developer rep or my developer rep.
[1:23:34.240 --> 1:23:36.760]  I don't know how you go about getting a developer rep
[1:23:36.760 --> 1:23:41.000]  for the first, I don't know, five years that I had an app
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:44.160]  in the app for all of Instapaper and all of the magazine.
[1:23:44.160 --> 1:23:49.040]  I never, I could never find one, no one ever contacted me.
[1:23:49.040 --> 1:23:52.720]  I didn't have a developer rep if that even is a thing.
[1:23:52.720 --> 1:23:57.280]  It wasn't until overcast that somebody,
[1:23:57.280 --> 1:23:58.880]  somebody emailed me from, you know,
[1:23:58.880 --> 1:24:00.640]  some press thing like they reached out.
[1:24:02.160 --> 1:24:06.640]  And so it wasn't really until that that I had like,
[1:24:06.640 --> 1:24:10.120]  a contact that I could email at Apple to like ask a question
[1:24:10.120 --> 1:24:12.520]  to or to bring a concern to.
[1:24:12.520 --> 1:24:16.080]  Like it was like, it wasn't until last year.
[1:24:16.080 --> 1:24:19.480]  And I've been in the app store since 2008.
[1:24:21.280 --> 1:24:24.800]  And when I mentioned this to the person, they,
[1:24:24.800 --> 1:24:28.640]  let's just, and let's not mince words with some success.
[1:24:28.640 --> 1:24:32.160]  Yeah, I mean, it's, again, I'm not, you know,
[1:24:32.160 --> 1:24:35.080]  it's not like you wrote YouTube, but, you know,
[1:24:35.080 --> 1:24:36.120]  pretty popular apps.
[1:24:36.120 --> 1:24:38.560]  Right. And yeah, it didn't matter.
[1:24:38.560 --> 1:24:40.040]  And when I mentioned this to this person
[1:24:40.040 --> 1:24:42.080]  that I had never found any contacts
[1:24:42.080 --> 1:24:43.600]  and develop relationships before,
[1:24:43.600 --> 1:24:44.840]  they were like, they were surprised.
[1:24:44.840 --> 1:24:45.960]  They were like, really?
[1:24:45.960 --> 1:24:46.800]  Are you sure?
[1:24:46.800 --> 1:24:49.160]  Like that, really like that's like,
[1:24:49.160 --> 1:24:50.520]  they were even surprised at that.
[1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:52.760]  But like, I don't think that people
[1:24:52.760 --> 1:24:55.560]  in the developer relations division,
[1:24:55.560 --> 1:24:57.960]  like, I don't think they have a good idea
[1:24:57.960 --> 1:24:59.600]  of how it looks from the outside
[1:24:59.600 --> 1:25:03.280]  of how the developer relations system
[1:25:03.280 --> 1:25:05.120]  and how Apple as a whole
[1:25:05.120 --> 1:25:08.200]  appears to and communicates with developers
[1:25:08.200 --> 1:25:10.880]  who are not in with somebody.
[1:25:10.880 --> 1:25:13.080]  The gist of it, what I've heard, and I believe it,
[1:25:13.080 --> 1:25:15.400]  and it definitely plays on developer relations,
[1:25:15.400 --> 1:25:17.720]  but they're so overwhelmed developer relations
[1:25:17.720 --> 1:25:19.600]  that the reps are just, and they're not,
[1:25:19.600 --> 1:25:24.400]  and not known, and hard to initiate contact with.
[1:25:24.400 --> 1:25:27.240]  And even once they do, it just never becomes a priority
[1:25:27.240 --> 1:25:30.360]  that the whole internal, I'm gonna call it radar,
[1:25:30.360 --> 1:25:32.840]  but maybe it's maybe that's not just
[1:25:32.840 --> 1:25:34.280]  where maybe radar's just the database,
[1:25:34.280 --> 1:25:37.720]  but the whole radar system is entirely geared internally
[1:25:37.720 --> 1:25:41.840]  toward fixing bugs from within Apple itself, right?
[1:25:41.840 --> 1:25:43.440]  So if you're on, if you're writing,
[1:25:43.440 --> 1:25:45.120]  if you're one of the engineers on pages
[1:25:45.120 --> 1:25:48.160]  and you run into a text kit bug,
[1:25:48.160 --> 1:25:51.160]  it gets taken care of exactly as you would think,
[1:25:51.160 --> 1:25:53.280]  and it goes up the post and it gets put
[1:25:53.280 --> 1:25:54.880]  in front of the right person,
[1:25:54.880 --> 1:25:57.160]  and they run your example project and say,
[1:25:57.160 --> 1:26:01.120]  oh, I see and fix it, and then, you know, it just works.
[1:26:01.120 --> 1:26:03.800]  It's all, but it's, there's nothing like that
[1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:07.360]  from the outside, like it's like 99% internal
[1:26:07.360 --> 1:26:10.040]  and like 1% external.
[1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:12.600]  And I'm not saying the balance should be 50-50,
[1:26:12.600 --> 1:26:15.400]  you know, I think it's, you know, obvious
[1:26:15.400 --> 1:26:17.960]  that of course Apple's gonna fix their own bugs first,
[1:26:17.960 --> 1:26:21.320]  but it's just not even close.
[1:26:21.320 --> 1:26:24.960]  And it's not even like, oh, poor us poor
[1:26:24.960 --> 1:26:27.480]  third party developers, we're not getting our bugs fixed,
[1:26:27.480 --> 1:26:29.840]  it's these are things that affect users, everybody, you know,
[1:26:29.840 --> 1:26:31.880]  the bug, we're fighting for these bugs
[1:26:31.880 --> 1:26:35.000]  because they affect the experience of the users.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:38.160]  Right, exactly. I don't know, I mean, like,
[1:26:38.160 --> 1:26:40.400]  I don't know how you solve this problem
[1:26:40.400 --> 1:26:43.480]  except by making certain parts of Apple much bigger.
[1:26:43.480 --> 1:26:45.960]  And that's obviously not an easy thing to do.
[1:26:45.960 --> 1:26:47.480]  Like, you know, they're all the like mythical man
[1:26:47.480 --> 1:26:50.400]  month kind of things like, and I think it's a staff up.
[1:26:50.400 --> 1:26:52.840]  I think it's a scary thing for them to do too
[1:26:52.840 --> 1:26:56.760]  because, you know, they've seen it over the, you know,
[1:26:56.760 --> 1:26:59.560]  everybody's seen this industry for 20 years,
[1:26:59.560 --> 1:27:02.120]  and everybody knows that Microsoft got a lot bigger,
[1:27:02.120 --> 1:27:05.920]  and then it got, it got slow and lumbering.
[1:27:05.920 --> 1:27:08.200]  Right, and they also, you know,
[1:27:08.200 --> 1:27:11.000]  they're gonna have trouble staffing up possibly
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  because when you work for Apple,
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:15.720]  you have, you know, you have to,
[1:27:15.720 --> 1:27:17.520]  first of all, you have to be there.
[1:27:17.520 --> 1:27:19.560]  Like, they don't do remote work for most things.
[1:27:19.560 --> 1:27:21.200]  They have a couple of remote offices
[1:27:21.200 --> 1:27:22.880]  for certain like isolated projects,
[1:27:22.880 --> 1:27:24.920]  but for the most part, they don't do remote work.
[1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:26.480]  So you have to be there.
[1:27:26.480 --> 1:27:28.840]  They're competing with everyone else
[1:27:28.840 --> 1:27:31.920]  in the Silicon Valley region for top talent,
[1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:34.800]  and that is extremely competitive.
[1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:39.800]  And I would imagine they probably have trouble
[1:27:39.800 --> 1:27:41.200]  retaining a lot of these good people
[1:27:41.200 --> 1:27:43.280]  because like, I mean, you know,
[1:27:43.280 --> 1:27:45.040]  we know tons of tons of like our friends
[1:27:45.040 --> 1:27:46.680]  and people we knew at Apple who like,
[1:27:46.680 --> 1:27:48.520]  they were at Apple for a while,
[1:27:48.520 --> 1:27:50.120]  and then they want to go out and try being
[1:27:50.120 --> 1:27:52.960]  an iOS developer or being a Mac developer themselves,
[1:27:52.960 --> 1:27:54.720]  like independently because when you're in Apple,
[1:27:54.720 --> 1:27:56.360]  you can't really have side projects.
[1:27:56.360 --> 1:27:57.200]  Yeah, and it's funny,
[1:27:57.200 --> 1:28:01.160]  I bet being a developer relations wrap is even more
[1:28:01.160 --> 1:28:03.040]  easily poached because your whole job
[1:28:03.040 --> 1:28:04.520]  is reaching out to other people
[1:28:04.520 --> 1:28:06.040]  and they're gonna be like, wow, you're awesome,
[1:28:06.040 --> 1:28:07.520]  why don't you come work for us?
[1:28:07.520 --> 1:28:08.360]  Right, yeah.
[1:28:08.360 --> 1:28:09.200]  I bet it happens.
[1:28:09.200 --> 1:28:12.320]  Yeah, and if you're like an iOS expert
[1:28:12.320 --> 1:28:14.320]  who has worked for Apple,
[1:28:14.320 --> 1:28:16.080]  that's a pretty good qualifier.
[1:28:16.080 --> 1:28:19.360]  I would imagine it makes you pretty valuable on the market.
[1:28:19.360 --> 1:28:22.880]  So I expect that they probably have a lot of trouble
[1:28:22.880 --> 1:28:26.280]  first attracting and then retaining great talent there
[1:28:26.280 --> 1:28:29.120]  in addition to any cultural issues
[1:28:29.120 --> 1:28:30.720]  and challenges that would come with trying
[1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:33.200]  to grow the company substantially larger.
[1:28:33.200 --> 1:28:35.680]  So, but I don't really see a way around that
[1:28:35.680 --> 1:28:37.160]  being the eventual outcome.
[1:28:37.160 --> 1:28:40.600]  Like, I don't think they can keep the company
[1:28:40.600 --> 1:28:41.440]  the current size.
[1:28:41.440 --> 1:28:43.240]  And I know they also have issues with like,
[1:28:43.240 --> 1:28:44.440]  they don't have the space.
[1:28:44.440 --> 1:28:45.920]  Like, that's why they're building this giant new campus.
[1:28:45.920 --> 1:28:47.240]  Like, they're out of room too,
[1:28:47.240 --> 1:28:49.320]  but you know, there's all these problems,
[1:28:49.320 --> 1:28:53.080]  but you know, these problems aren't just gonna disappear.
[1:28:53.080 --> 1:28:56.480]  Like, and I think they are working towards,
[1:28:56.480 --> 1:28:58.560]  that I hope they're working towards that.
[1:28:58.560 --> 1:29:00.600]  But I think there's gonna be some uncomfortable
[1:29:00.600 --> 1:29:02.840]  migration, uncomfortable growth,
[1:29:02.840 --> 1:29:05.800]  as the company becomes a bigger organization.
[1:29:05.800 --> 1:29:06.920]  But I think it has to be.
[1:29:08.240 --> 1:29:09.920]  Yeah, I think people are,
[1:29:09.920 --> 1:29:11.960]  third party developers are exercising things
[1:29:11.960 --> 1:29:14.360]  that just don't get exercised within Apple.
[1:29:14.360 --> 1:29:17.840]  You know, I would say like the extensions
[1:29:17.840 --> 1:29:20.320]  are a perfect example of that,
[1:29:20.320 --> 1:29:22.160]  like the sharing extensions,
[1:29:22.160 --> 1:29:23.960]  where Apple knew what they would be used for,
[1:29:23.960 --> 1:29:26.240]  but the things that Apple itself really wants in there,
[1:29:26.240 --> 1:29:28.440]  they were already there anyway.
[1:29:28.440 --> 1:29:31.080]  Because if Apple is collectively agreed,
[1:29:31.080 --> 1:29:32.540]  hey, this should be in the sharing extension
[1:29:32.540 --> 1:29:33.380]  for everybody,
[1:29:33.380 --> 1:29:36.320]  then it was built into the system's sharing panel.
[1:29:36.320 --> 1:29:38.800]  It was only when third party developers started doing it.
[1:29:38.800 --> 1:29:41.560]  But that thing is so full of little tiny bugs,
[1:29:41.560 --> 1:29:43.040]  like the way that when you reorder them,
[1:29:43.040 --> 1:29:44.440]  the order doesn't stick.
[1:29:44.440 --> 1:29:48.320]  And there's just a bunch of little things like that.
[1:29:48.320 --> 1:29:49.840]  You know, it's just a perfect example of something
[1:29:49.840 --> 1:29:52.160]  that to me doesn't quite work, right?
[1:29:52.160 --> 1:29:56.200]  Right, and there was a couple of little limitations
[1:29:56.200 --> 1:29:58.920]  that ended up having pretty big ramifications.
[1:29:58.920 --> 1:30:00.920]  I believe it was Brian Iris of Tumblr,
[1:30:00.920 --> 1:30:02.400]  made a nice blog post.
[1:30:02.400 --> 1:30:04.480]  Right before I was a eight came out,
[1:30:04.480 --> 1:30:06.200]  listing all the little challenges
[1:30:06.200 --> 1:30:07.880]  that they had with the Tumblr extension.
[1:30:07.880 --> 1:30:10.240]  And he did the right thing.
[1:30:10.240 --> 1:30:11.760]  He reported the mall as radars
[1:30:11.760 --> 1:30:14.200]  and listed all the radar numbers in the post and everything.
[1:30:15.200 --> 1:30:18.720]  But, you know, like they actually,
[1:30:18.720 --> 1:30:21.400]  like I remember, well, I don't know if that's public.
[1:30:21.400 --> 1:30:22.240]  Anyway.
[1:30:22.240 --> 1:30:28.040]  So we learned building the iOS, Tumblr iOS share extension.
[1:30:28.040 --> 1:30:29.480]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[1:30:29.480 --> 1:30:32.360]  So it will be in the show notes.
[1:30:32.360 --> 1:30:35.720]  So we have, you know, the system itself, it has bugs.
[1:30:35.720 --> 1:30:37.280]  It has all these limitations.
[1:30:37.280 --> 1:30:38.720]  It's, you know, that's got to get better.
[1:30:38.720 --> 1:30:40.000]  And, you know, hopefully it will,
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:41.240]  over time it probably will.
[1:30:41.240 --> 1:30:44.200]  But I think, you know, and all the stuff
[1:30:44.200 --> 1:30:45.480]  that were on the app rejection
[1:30:45.480 --> 1:30:48.120]  is pretty substantially worse too.
[1:30:48.120 --> 1:30:49.320]  Like all the rejections around us.
[1:30:49.320 --> 1:30:54.320]  I think what we're seeing is the policy from Apple is pretty clear.
[1:30:56.280 --> 1:31:00.760]  The policy is, the implied policy rather,
[1:31:00.760 --> 1:31:03.560]  is keyboards should not contain anything
[1:31:03.560 --> 1:31:04.760]  that isn't a keyboard.
[1:31:04.760 --> 1:31:07.040]  Like, you know, it shouldn't be able to do anything
[1:31:07.040 --> 1:31:10.240]  that is not like text entry, you know.
[1:31:10.240 --> 1:31:13.920]  It shouldn't have any other cool features built in
[1:31:13.920 --> 1:31:15.360]  like a calculator built into your keyboard.
[1:31:15.360 --> 1:31:16.960]  Like, they obviously, like,
[1:31:16.960 --> 1:31:19.520]  this is the implied rule, your keyboard
[1:31:19.520 --> 1:31:21.360]  should only be a keyboard of some sort.
[1:31:21.360 --> 1:31:23.040]  Yeah, no extras.
[1:31:23.040 --> 1:31:25.560]  Can't put a version of desert golfing in as a keyboard.
[1:31:25.560 --> 1:31:26.400]  Correct.
[1:31:26.400 --> 1:31:29.320]  Similarly, your today view, your today extension
[1:31:29.320 --> 1:31:32.760]  or widget, whatever they're called, your today view
[1:31:32.760 --> 1:31:37.440]  should or must be in general a quick glance kind of thing.
[1:31:37.440 --> 1:31:39.600]  It shouldn't be the place where you spend time.
[1:31:39.600 --> 1:31:41.560]  It shouldn't be a place where you complete
[1:31:41.560 --> 1:31:42.760]  a long running task.
[1:31:42.760 --> 1:31:45.080]  It should just be a quick view.
[1:31:45.080 --> 1:31:47.160]  Those are the implied rules.
[1:31:47.160 --> 1:31:48.880]  But they won't come out and say that.
[1:31:48.880 --> 1:31:51.120]  Like, they won't codify that and say,
[1:31:51.120 --> 1:31:53.520]  this is the rule, it's a high level rule.
[1:31:53.520 --> 1:31:55.560]  This should only be used for this.
[1:31:55.560 --> 1:31:58.320]  Like, that's clearly what they want.
[1:31:58.320 --> 1:32:01.240]  But what they're saying instead is,
[1:32:01.240 --> 1:32:04.080]  well, we're gonna try to draw the line exactly where,
[1:32:04.080 --> 1:32:05.480]  like, more precisely where there should be,
[1:32:05.480 --> 1:32:06.320]  more lower level.
[1:32:06.320 --> 1:32:07.760]  And then I say, well, you can't have buttons
[1:32:07.760 --> 1:32:09.720]  that launch your app or you can't complete the task
[1:32:09.720 --> 1:32:11.200]  or you can't have too many buttons
[1:32:11.200 --> 1:32:12.440]  or you can't have this kind of button
[1:32:12.440 --> 1:32:14.160]  or you can't simulate a keyboard in your today view.
[1:32:14.160 --> 1:32:17.920]  Like, they try to come up with all these little tiny explanations
[1:32:17.920 --> 1:32:21.080]  of lower level implementation detail rules.
[1:32:21.080 --> 1:32:24.560]  But that's clearly not, like, those are all just,
[1:32:24.560 --> 1:32:27.920]  you know, that is somebody not wanting to state
[1:32:27.920 --> 1:32:31.360]  the real rule, the higher level rule, which is,
[1:32:31.360 --> 1:32:33.280]  this system is intended only for this.
[1:32:33.280 --> 1:32:35.200]  You can all your only allowed to do this.
[1:32:36.880 --> 1:32:39.720]  And that it's just not, I don't know,
[1:32:39.720 --> 1:32:41.880]  I don't know why they won't just say the higher level rule
[1:32:41.880 --> 1:32:45.480]  because I think that would actually generate less controversy
[1:32:45.480 --> 1:32:47.760]  and would be easier for developers to follow.
[1:32:47.760 --> 1:32:50.200]  And certainly some developers would be like,
[1:32:50.200 --> 1:32:51.120]  well, does this count?
[1:32:51.120 --> 1:32:52.720]  But, you know, you see the high level rule
[1:32:52.720 --> 1:32:54.400]  and that would at least give you some idea,
[1:32:54.400 --> 1:32:56.280]  like, if I stray from this,
[1:32:56.280 --> 1:32:58.720]  it's gonna be rocky territory and a rejection risk.
[1:32:58.720 --> 1:33:01.120]  I think the app store stuff definitely plays into it.
[1:33:01.120 --> 1:33:02.480]  I don't know how different that is
[1:33:02.480 --> 1:33:05.160]  from typical dev relations, but it ought to be tied up
[1:33:05.160 --> 1:33:08.320]  because it's an app-less view, the app store is,
[1:33:08.320 --> 1:33:11.160]  and for iOS, it absolutely is the only way
[1:33:11.160 --> 1:33:13.600]  other than the enterprise stuff.
[1:33:13.600 --> 1:33:15.000]  You know, it's the only way,
[1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:17.640]  it's an inextricable part of the development process.
[1:33:17.640 --> 1:33:19.680]  So, app store problems should be considered
[1:33:19.680 --> 1:33:21.640]  developer relation problems.
[1:33:21.640 --> 1:33:24.520]  The whole thing, like with the reason things panic
[1:33:24.520 --> 1:33:28.240]  has gone through and like where they had the issue
[1:33:28.240 --> 1:33:33.240]  with their saving feature in Transmit,
[1:33:33.760 --> 1:33:35.880]  where they didn't want them to be able to save
[1:33:35.880 --> 1:33:37.760]  to iCloud Drive and therefore they had to take
[1:33:37.760 --> 1:33:39.560]  the whole thing out because even the stuff
[1:33:39.560 --> 1:33:41.840]  that hooks up to Dropbox and Box.net
[1:33:41.840 --> 1:33:43.800]  because there's no control over that.
[1:33:45.160 --> 1:33:46.720]  And then, you know, I wrote about it,
[1:33:46.720 --> 1:33:48.120]  a couple other people wrote about it
[1:33:48.120 --> 1:33:49.200]  and then all, you know,
[1:33:49.200 --> 1:33:52.680]  Sainer minds prevailed and okay, I got it fixed.
[1:33:52.680 --> 1:33:53.880]  And there's this whole ankle there,
[1:33:53.880 --> 1:33:56.560]  everybody agrees on everybody that you shouldn't have
[1:33:56.560 --> 1:34:00.640]  to have, you know, daring fireball publish it
[1:34:00.640 --> 1:34:03.040]  to get your story fixed.
[1:34:03.040 --> 1:34:05.000]  You shouldn't have to go public to get that.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  And you shouldn't have to be of the prominence of panic
[1:34:11.960 --> 1:34:14.160]  to do that, you know, like some upstart
[1:34:14.160 --> 1:34:16.320]  who nobody's heard of yet should be able to get this,
[1:34:16.320 --> 1:34:20.000]  you know, the same reasonable correction
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:22.520]  with an app store problem that panic got.
[1:34:23.600 --> 1:34:27.280]  Right, and they have, they have the appeal system set up there.
[1:34:27.280 --> 1:34:29.760]  So, like, in theory, it should work.
[1:34:29.760 --> 1:34:31.600]  You should be able to go to the appeal,
[1:34:31.600 --> 1:34:33.680]  which like, you know, from what I understand,
[1:34:33.680 --> 1:34:35.560]  so that, you know, you have the reviewers on one level
[1:34:35.560 --> 1:34:37.160]  and for what I understand, the appeal doesn't just
[1:34:37.160 --> 1:34:38.000]  go to the same people.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.200]  It goes to like a level above those people.
[1:34:40.200 --> 1:34:43.680]  And so, if some reviewer just made a bad call,
[1:34:43.680 --> 1:34:45.200]  the appeal should work.
[1:34:45.200 --> 1:34:48.280]  The system that's in place there should work.
[1:34:48.280 --> 1:34:51.560]  The question is, why doesn't it work as well
[1:34:51.560 --> 1:34:52.480]  as we're into the press?
[1:34:52.480 --> 1:34:55.640]  Like, we're into the press and making a big stink.
[1:34:55.640 --> 1:34:57.560]  Yeah, that's gonna work just by the way, PR works.
[1:34:57.560 --> 1:34:59.080]  That's gonna work a little bit better, you know,
[1:34:59.080 --> 1:35:02.360]  on occasion, but it shouldn't work so much better.
[1:35:02.360 --> 1:35:05.520]  It shouldn't be like, and in panic, even said,
[1:35:05.520 --> 1:35:06.680]  I mean, in panic, we'll say these things
[1:35:06.680 --> 1:35:09.240]  in the nicest way possible because, you know,
[1:35:09.240 --> 1:35:12.800]  they don't wanna start any stuff, but you know,
[1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:14.800]  they even said, like, it's unfortunate,
[1:35:14.800 --> 1:35:18.200]  but, you know, this method is what works.
[1:35:18.200 --> 1:35:21.320]  And we've gotten a Q branch, we've gotten bugs fixed
[1:35:21.320 --> 1:35:23.800]  because we know people who work on the framework
[1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:26.040]  that we're having the problem with.
[1:35:26.040 --> 1:35:30.720]  And we could, you know, I think literally at WWDC,
[1:35:30.720 --> 1:35:33.120]  Brent had, like, coffee with somebody
[1:35:33.120 --> 1:35:34.960]  and showed the example problem,
[1:35:34.960 --> 1:35:37.360]  which he had already submitted months ago in a radar.
[1:35:37.360 --> 1:35:40.520]  You know, here's a simple 13 line example project
[1:35:40.520 --> 1:35:41.960]  that shows the bug exactly.
[1:35:41.960 --> 1:35:45.280]  But he got to show it to a guy from the framework team,
[1:35:46.200 --> 1:35:48.400]  right in his face, you know, not not a confrontational,
[1:35:48.400 --> 1:35:49.520]  you know, Brent, but it was like,
[1:35:49.520 --> 1:35:51.600]  drinking coffee at the hotel bar,
[1:35:51.600 --> 1:35:53.040]  and the guy was like, oh, I see.
[1:35:53.040 --> 1:35:54.160]  Oh, I bet I know what that is.
[1:35:54.160 --> 1:35:55.840]  And he like, you know, made a note of it.
[1:35:55.840 --> 1:35:58.000]  But you shouldn't have to know somebody
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:00.360]  and have coffee with an engineer, you know,
[1:36:00.360 --> 1:36:02.200]  it's just because Brent knew that, you know,
[1:36:02.200 --> 1:36:03.440]  knew him for years.
[1:36:03.440 --> 1:36:06.720]  That doesn't scale, to say that that doesn't scale
[1:36:06.720 --> 1:36:09.920]  is, you know, self-evident.
[1:36:09.920 --> 1:36:12.960]  Right. I mean, so you have, in the reality
[1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:15.240]  of the iOS ecosystem and the math,
[1:36:15.240 --> 1:36:17.520]  the reality of the Apple Dev ecosystem
[1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:20.920]  is that you have the official channels up
[1:36:20.920 --> 1:36:24.000]  that are just this tremendous wall and filter.
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:26.520]  And, you know, and what you said really makes sense
[1:36:26.520 --> 1:36:28.480]  that they are extremely understaffed in these areas
[1:36:28.480 --> 1:36:30.880]  or they're not scaling very well.
[1:36:30.880 --> 1:36:34.240]  That explains a lot because it seems like
[1:36:34.240 --> 1:36:38.480]  where the general public is shown to go is just a wall
[1:36:38.480 --> 1:36:41.960]  that is extremely ineffective, has very few ways in,
[1:36:41.960 --> 1:36:44.320]  and it is just very off-putting
[1:36:44.320 --> 1:36:48.360]  and just, you know, they're trying to deflect everyone.
[1:36:48.360 --> 1:36:49.800]  It's like when you call a big company
[1:36:49.800 --> 1:36:51.440]  and you get put in hold for 35 minutes
[1:36:51.440 --> 1:36:52.880]  on some touch-tone menu that really wants you
[1:36:52.880 --> 1:36:54.360]  to follow with self-help options.
[1:36:54.360 --> 1:36:58.160]  Like, they don't want you to get in through the public way
[1:36:58.160 --> 1:37:00.400]  because they can't handle it all.
[1:37:00.400 --> 1:37:03.040]  Then you have all of us going through like the side door
[1:37:03.040 --> 1:37:06.000]  because we know somebody and that ends up working better.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  That's not good.
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:09.040]  Like, that should be embarrassing,
[1:37:09.040 --> 1:37:10.760]  but it should be a major problem that you need to fix.
[1:37:10.760 --> 1:37:12.360]  And it seems like something they could fix
[1:37:12.360 --> 1:37:14.440]  because, you know, like, and again,
[1:37:14.440 --> 1:37:16.080]  I think the biggest problem is what you said,
[1:37:16.080 --> 1:37:18.600]  which is just that hiring talented people in general
[1:37:18.600 --> 1:37:21.920]  is hard and it's especially hard in the valley.
[1:37:23.400 --> 1:37:25.840]  But, you know, guess what works, money,
[1:37:25.840 --> 1:37:27.720]  and guess what Apple has, they have money.
[1:37:27.720 --> 1:37:30.800]  So, that can't help, I think it is fixable.
[1:37:30.800 --> 1:37:33.800]  Well, and, you know, who's to say they have
[1:37:33.800 --> 1:37:35.920]  to always keep everybody in Cupretino, right?
[1:37:35.920 --> 1:37:38.760]  Like, they think, like, there are parts of their business
[1:37:38.760 --> 1:37:41.440]  that can be easily on, that's not the location.
[1:37:41.440 --> 1:37:43.400]  Like, I work as in Pittsburgh.
[1:37:43.400 --> 1:37:45.560]  Like, there are parts of Apple's business
[1:37:45.560 --> 1:37:46.880]  that can be other places.
[1:37:46.880 --> 1:37:48.880]  And I think Gus was saying,
[1:37:48.880 --> 1:37:50.760]  they're opening up an office in Seattle.
[1:37:50.760 --> 1:37:51.600]  Yeah.
[1:37:51.600 --> 1:37:53.560]  So, like, it looks like they might be starting
[1:37:53.560 --> 1:37:56.320]  to be more willing to branch this out a little bit.
[1:37:56.320 --> 1:37:59.600]  Yeah, I think the Seattle office is gonna be cloud stuff.
[1:37:59.600 --> 1:38:00.440]  I don't know.
[1:38:00.440 --> 1:38:01.280]  Yeah, that's the rumor.
[1:38:01.280 --> 1:38:02.280]  I don't know if you have any good info on that yet,
[1:38:02.280 --> 1:38:03.120]  but yeah.
[1:38:03.120 --> 1:38:03.960]  But, yeah.
[1:38:03.960 --> 1:38:08.880]  So, like, I think, you know, they need to start
[1:38:08.880 --> 1:38:11.600]  breaking down some of these barriers with themselves
[1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:14.320]  of like the way they've always done things
[1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:17.000]  or the kind of, or the rules they have internally,
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:18.920]  if they say everyone has to work on site,
[1:38:18.920 --> 1:38:22.480]  you better make more sites because in more places,
[1:38:22.480 --> 1:38:26.120]  because that's like, they have to become a bigger company.
[1:38:26.120 --> 1:38:28.480]  There are so many areas where they are clearly
[1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:30.520]  understaffed or under resourced.
[1:38:30.520 --> 1:38:31.800]  And as you said, it's not for money.
[1:38:31.800 --> 1:38:35.600]  Like, it's not because of money as far as we can tell.
[1:38:35.600 --> 1:38:38.800]  Unless they foresee a near-term future
[1:38:38.800 --> 1:38:40.840]  where they're not going to have so many third-party
[1:38:40.840 --> 1:38:43.240]  developers, and I don't see how they could possibly
[1:38:43.240 --> 1:38:45.400]  think that, because it doesn't see,
[1:38:45.400 --> 1:38:46.840]  I don't see how that's possible.
[1:38:47.840 --> 1:38:50.600]  They really need a bigger developer relations team,
[1:38:50.600 --> 1:38:53.280]  much bigger, like factor of 10.
[1:38:53.280 --> 1:38:57.040]  With not just headcount, but with authority
[1:38:57.040 --> 1:39:00.720]  within the company to get issues escalated
[1:39:00.720 --> 1:39:03.040]  and put in front of the right people.
[1:39:03.040 --> 1:39:04.480]  And as this week has gone on,
[1:39:04.480 --> 1:39:06.480]  and this has been the topic of the week,
[1:39:06.480 --> 1:39:09.840]  I'm thinking, my thinking has shifted more and more
[1:39:09.840 --> 1:39:13.160]  that it's a lot more a developer relations problem
[1:39:13.160 --> 1:39:15.880]  and a lot less due to what I initially
[1:39:15.880 --> 1:39:17.240]  had been thinking for a long time,
[1:39:17.240 --> 1:39:20.120]  which is the annual release cycle of the two OS's.
[1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:22.440]  Well, I think there's two different problems.
[1:39:22.440 --> 1:39:23.840]  I mean, I think so.
[1:39:23.840 --> 1:39:25.360]  And I think there's, I think it's, you know,
[1:39:25.360 --> 1:39:27.160]  it's clearly multi-variable,
[1:39:27.160 --> 1:39:29.840]  and those are both definitely two of the variables.
[1:39:29.840 --> 1:39:31.880]  Absolutely, but my thinking has shifted
[1:39:31.880 --> 1:39:35.320]  in terms of which one is a bigger problem.
[1:39:35.320 --> 1:39:40.320]  And I think too, which one to my eyes meshes
[1:39:40.600 --> 1:39:44.440]  with the timeline of what I'm seeing.
[1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:47.680]  I've, you know, I think that it's as iOS has gotten
[1:39:47.680 --> 1:39:50.600]  more complicated and therefore there are more things
[1:39:50.600 --> 1:39:52.600]  that could go wrong.
[1:39:52.600 --> 1:39:57.600]  And as the ratio of developers to developer relations
[1:39:59.960 --> 1:40:03.320]  people within Apple has gotten more and more absurd,
[1:40:03.320 --> 1:40:08.320]  that correlates to me to my eyes with the shift in quality.
[1:40:08.680 --> 1:40:11.080]  And again, I think Hockingberry nailed it.
[1:40:11.080 --> 1:40:13.160]  It's like loose screws.
[1:40:13.160 --> 1:40:16.280]  It's the software equivalent of loose screws.
[1:40:16.280 --> 1:40:18.320]  Yeah, I just feel like sloppy little flaws
[1:40:18.320 --> 1:40:20.760]  that aren't fatal, but yeah.
[1:40:20.760 --> 1:40:24.080]  I mean, and I think these problems are intertwined.
[1:40:24.080 --> 1:40:26.640]  You know, like, like, it's hard to,
[1:40:26.640 --> 1:40:28.960]  it's hard to say well developer relations is responsible
[1:40:28.960 --> 1:40:31.760]  for a general decline in quality and Apple software
[1:40:31.760 --> 1:40:32.560]  and services.
[1:40:32.560 --> 1:40:33.400]  Right.
[1:40:33.400 --> 1:40:34.240]  That's too simple.
[1:40:34.240 --> 1:40:35.080]  That's way too simple.
[1:40:35.080 --> 1:40:36.880]  Right.
[1:40:36.880 --> 1:40:37.760]  But you can look at certain parts.
[1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:41.120]  You can say like, well, if they're saying
[1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:43.960]  that they're not seeing more bugs being reported
[1:40:43.960 --> 1:40:45.600]  and therefore they don't know what problems to fix,
[1:40:45.600 --> 1:40:47.320]  they don't have enough information to fix them,
[1:40:47.320 --> 1:40:49.440]  why aren't more bugs being reported?
[1:40:49.440 --> 1:40:50.960]  And then you can start following that rabbit hole.
[1:40:50.960 --> 1:40:52.640]  I'd be like, oh, well, actually,
[1:40:52.640 --> 1:40:54.240]  this is related to developer relations
[1:40:54.240 --> 1:40:56.120]  or related to the bug reported system,
[1:40:56.120 --> 1:40:58.760]  related to the image Apple has among developers
[1:40:58.760 --> 1:41:00.280]  and the personality, like,
[1:41:00.280 --> 1:41:03.240]  because the personality of individual people
[1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:06.360]  within Apple, I've spoken with, or that I know,
[1:41:06.360 --> 1:41:08.400]  couldn't possibly be more different
[1:41:08.400 --> 1:41:10.440]  than the public persona of Apple.
[1:41:10.440 --> 1:41:12.840]  The public persona of Apple is, as I said,
[1:41:12.840 --> 1:41:15.160]  it's a brick wall and it's pretty terse
[1:41:15.160 --> 1:41:18.640]  and it's pretty unwelcoming to developers
[1:41:18.640 --> 1:41:21.400]  and to public input of any kind, really.
[1:41:21.400 --> 1:41:22.240]  Yeah.
[1:41:22.240 --> 1:41:23.760]  But the individual people I've met
[1:41:23.760 --> 1:41:26.040]  and spoken with at Apple are the complete opposite.
[1:41:26.040 --> 1:41:27.520]  They're friendly, normal people.
[1:41:27.520 --> 1:41:28.520]  They're a lot of our friends.
[1:41:28.520 --> 1:41:31.440]  Like, so why is that disconnect there?
[1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:33.480]  And they take enormous pride in our work.
[1:41:33.480 --> 1:41:36.160]  Like, if you are lucky enough to get your bug
[1:41:36.160 --> 1:41:37.560]  in front of the person who can,
[1:41:37.560 --> 1:41:39.320]  like an engineer who can fix it,
[1:41:39.320 --> 1:41:40.920]  they're gonna take care of it.
[1:41:40.920 --> 1:41:43.160]  They are offended by any and all bugs.
[1:41:43.160 --> 1:41:44.000]  Right.
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:45.840]  Good engineers.
[1:41:45.840 --> 1:41:47.360]  So what is the disconnect here?
[1:41:47.360 --> 1:41:49.240]  Is it a process issue?
[1:41:49.240 --> 1:41:50.800]  Is it a policy issue?
[1:41:50.800 --> 1:41:54.040]  Is it just like inertia going in their own direction
[1:41:54.040 --> 1:41:54.880]  and certain things?
[1:41:54.880 --> 1:41:55.480]  I don't know.
[1:41:55.480 --> 1:42:00.480]  But the issues at Apple are seemingly deep rooted.
[1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:03.440]  It's something that's like not budging.
[1:42:03.440 --> 1:42:05.560]  Like some part of the culture inside
[1:42:05.560 --> 1:42:08.040]  or the process, the way things are done,
[1:42:08.040 --> 1:42:12.360]  is it needs to be modernized and it hasn't been yet.
[1:42:12.360 --> 1:42:13.920]  And that's not an easy thing to do.
[1:42:13.920 --> 1:42:14.760]  You know, that's,
[1:42:14.760 --> 1:42:16.160]  I mean, I don't know any of my big companies.
[1:42:16.160 --> 1:42:18.400]  But I wonder how much too
[1:42:18.400 --> 1:42:20.880]  that the historical artifacts
[1:42:20.880 --> 1:42:23.320]  of the size of their developer relations team
[1:42:23.320 --> 1:42:24.960]  being relatively small.
[1:42:24.960 --> 1:42:26.360]  How much of that relates too?
[1:42:26.360 --> 1:42:29.920]  Not just the fact that 10, 15, 20 years ago,
[1:42:29.920 --> 1:42:32.560]  Apple was a, a smaller company,
[1:42:32.560 --> 1:42:34.440]  b, had far fewer users
[1:42:34.440 --> 1:42:36.560]  and c, had far fewer developers.
[1:42:36.560 --> 1:42:39.640]  But also with the peculiar nature
[1:42:39.640 --> 1:42:42.280]  of the third party to modernize,
[1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:44.040]  the peculiar to our currentize,
[1:42:44.040 --> 1:42:47.640]  of that it was dominated by just like three or four
[1:42:47.640 --> 1:42:50.360]  huge companies, Adobe, Microsoft,
[1:42:51.600 --> 1:42:54.480]  go so far into the macro media,
[1:42:56.160 --> 1:42:58.240]  just to hand, you know, maybe more than four or five.
[1:42:58.240 --> 1:43:01.400]  But, you know, that you just 10, 11, 12,
[1:43:01.400 --> 1:43:03.000]  big, big developers,
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:05.400]  who I think at, and by all accounts that I've heard,
[1:43:05.400 --> 1:43:07.200]  you know, did have, you know,
[1:43:08.400 --> 1:43:10.000]  like platinum card developer
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:12.680]  relations treatment from Apple,
[1:43:12.680 --> 1:43:14.440]  and that they were, they're sort of built up
[1:43:14.440 --> 1:43:15.720]  for that sort of world.
[1:43:16.880 --> 1:43:19.360]  Yeah, and that's, that's a very, very good point.
[1:43:19.360 --> 1:43:21.600]  I mean, it's, and it seems like a lot of Apple.
[1:43:21.600 --> 1:43:25.000]  Like, even if you look at like the SVP roles,
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  you know, why, why is the entire developer relations system
[1:43:30.320 --> 1:43:32.120]  under the head of marketing?
[1:43:32.120 --> 1:43:35.680]  Why is the entire cloud infrastructure system?
[1:43:36.560 --> 1:43:38.160]  Why is the same guy responsible
[1:43:38.160 --> 1:43:40.120]  for the entire cloud infrastructure system
[1:43:40.120 --> 1:43:42.720]  and also negotiating deals with record labels?
[1:43:42.720 --> 1:43:45.680]  Like, like, I think they need,
[1:43:45.680 --> 1:43:47.880]  they need to get wider as an organization.
[1:43:47.880 --> 1:43:50.040]  They need like more divisions
[1:43:50.040 --> 1:43:51.760]  and they need, they need some of these divisions
[1:43:51.760 --> 1:43:54.240]  to have like, you know, more, more power at the top
[1:43:54.240 --> 1:43:56.720]  or more, say, and, you know, like, like that's what,
[1:43:56.720 --> 1:43:58.360]  like I said, I tweeted a while ago,
[1:43:58.360 --> 1:44:02.320]  like if you want to see app areas where Apple doesn't do so well,
[1:44:02.320 --> 1:44:05.280]  look at which SVPs have way too much on their plate.
[1:44:05.280 --> 1:44:08.920]  Well, and again, I don't think it's like personal.
[1:44:08.920 --> 1:44:12.160]  Like, I don't think Phil Schiller and any Q are, you know,
[1:44:12.160 --> 1:44:13.080]  weak at their jobs.
[1:44:13.080 --> 1:44:16.600]  I'm saying like, if that's the way the organization is structured,
[1:44:16.600 --> 1:44:18.520]  where all these things are under like, you know,
[1:44:18.520 --> 1:44:22.160]  the like fairly disparate things are under one organization
[1:44:22.160 --> 1:44:24.640]  with one person representing them at the top,
[1:44:24.640 --> 1:44:26.840]  I think that's too much on their plate.
[1:44:26.840 --> 1:44:29.880]  Yeah. If anything, it's that they're effective at their jobs.
[1:44:29.880 --> 1:44:32.680]  I mean, I mean, it was, it was explicit.
[1:44:32.680 --> 1:44:37.360]  It was a rare instance where they publicly said, like when they added maps
[1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:41.320]  to Eddie Q's plate, you know, that usually they don't make announcements
[1:44:41.320 --> 1:44:44.040]  like that publicly, but the whole four stall thing was, you know,
[1:44:44.040 --> 1:44:45.400]  had to be done somewhat publicly.
[1:44:45.760 --> 1:44:48.560]  And the explanation was, Eddie, you know, get stuff done.
[1:44:48.720 --> 1:44:50.440]  So maps need stuff done.
[1:44:50.440 --> 1:44:54.680]  So now it's Eddie's and, you know, truth be told, maps has gotten significantly better.
[1:44:55.240 --> 1:44:57.520]  Yeah. People still, people point to maps.
[1:44:57.520 --> 1:45:00.240]  Maps is a bad example in my opinion, because maps is a product
[1:45:00.240 --> 1:45:02.440]  that I think is clearly headed in the right direction.
[1:45:02.960 --> 1:45:05.480]  Is it possible that it could be headed in that direction faster?
[1:45:05.480 --> 1:45:07.600]  I guess, of course, you can always do somewhat better.
[1:45:09.080 --> 1:45:12.120]  And is it, is it as good quality wise as Google maps?
[1:45:12.120 --> 1:45:13.960]  No, but that's, I think that's mainly
[1:45:13.960 --> 1:45:17.280]  because Google still has the pedal to the metal on Google maps.
[1:45:17.280 --> 1:45:21.600]  And Google is improving Google maps at a very quick rate.
[1:45:21.720 --> 1:45:27.520]  And so Apple maps might lag behind it for years to come until they sort
[1:45:27.520 --> 1:45:30.480]  of get to the, you know, the point of diminishing returns
[1:45:30.480 --> 1:45:33.080]  where they're both, you know, it's close to perfect as they can get.
[1:45:34.040 --> 1:45:36.480]  I think maps is a bad example, because I think they're getting a lot better
[1:45:36.480 --> 1:45:39.320]  in maps. Well, I disagree with, with the, with the chances
[1:45:39.320 --> 1:45:41.560]  of maps being, you know, eventually tying up with Google maps,
[1:45:41.560 --> 1:45:45.200]  because like those kind of large big data problems,
[1:45:45.560 --> 1:45:47.320]  Apple has never shown they're very good at them.
[1:45:47.960 --> 1:45:53.480]  They, they, where, where I think Apple gets a bum wrap is, is the general cloud
[1:45:53.480 --> 1:45:56.920]  services. I think maps today, Apple maps today is already better
[1:45:56.920 --> 1:45:58.600]  than Google maps was a few years ago.
[1:45:58.720 --> 1:46:01.680]  I'm not quite sure how many of you, I don't know what that, but I get,
[1:46:01.800 --> 1:46:06.640]  I get, I used to get bad, bad, driving directions from Google maps,
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:10.200]  you know, it was always better. It was just like with search where I was,
[1:46:10.600 --> 1:46:14.160]  I guess I used map quests before. And right when I switched to Google maps,
[1:46:14.160 --> 1:46:17.680]  it was like, this is better. And it wouldn't do stupid things like getting me
[1:46:17.680 --> 1:46:21.200]  from my house to, you know, I-95. It's like, you know,
[1:46:21.200 --> 1:46:27.360]  gave me reasonable directions for the first few steps of a trip. Um, in my
[1:46:27.360 --> 1:46:29.640]  experience, I mean, again, this is a sort of thing where everybody,
[1:46:29.640 --> 1:46:31.880]  depending on where you live, might be having different results.
[1:46:31.880 --> 1:46:35.280]  But I think Apple maps is already better than Google maps used to be some
[1:46:35.280 --> 1:46:39.560]  number of years ago. It's not as good as Google maps is today, but it's,
[1:46:39.600 --> 1:46:42.720]  it's getting there. I, like, I don't think that it's, I think it's already
[1:46:42.720 --> 1:46:46.360]  good enough that it's proof that they can do a large data set problem to
[1:46:46.360 --> 1:46:47.560]  some degree of quality.
[1:46:47.560 --> 1:46:52.760]  Maybe, I don't know, then I look at App Store search and I cry. Um, but I think
[1:46:52.760 --> 1:46:56.160]  overall, well, that's a scene. Now, that is a great example. I just forget
[1:46:56.160 --> 1:46:59.200]  about map, but App Store search is a great example of something that's
[1:46:59.240 --> 1:47:04.640]  always been shit is still shit. And there's no evidence at all that they're
[1:47:04.640 --> 1:47:08.920]  getting better at it or that they've hired anybody, you know, so to me,
[1:47:08.920 --> 1:47:13.080]  the solution is so obvious, just find someone who's done a good work at like
[1:47:13.080 --> 1:47:18.440]  Bing or Google search and hire a team of, you know, poacher team of engineers
[1:47:18.440 --> 1:47:21.320]  with experience at one of the successful search engines.
[1:47:22.080 --> 1:47:27.080]  I think the problem there is, you know, in general, the App Store, like the
[1:47:27.080 --> 1:47:30.160]  store itself, not like the politics they go on behind it, but like the store
[1:47:30.160 --> 1:47:34.360]  itself, the interface to the store, the infrastructure that runs the store,
[1:47:34.960 --> 1:47:39.320]  the store apps themselves, the categories in the store, the, the ability that
[1:47:39.520 --> 1:47:42.840]  the store pages have, like the different fields, the descriptions, you know,
[1:47:42.840 --> 1:47:47.560]  like all this stuff, that stuff changes incredibly slowly. A lot of it has
[1:47:47.560 --> 1:47:53.800]  never changed. Like it, the App Store, it seems like the install button
[1:47:53.800 --> 1:47:58.560]  for the Yosemite App Store still looks like the old Mac OS.
[1:47:58.680 --> 1:48:03.240]  Right. Yeah. And, and the boy that if you think the iOS App Store app is,
[1:48:03.240 --> 1:48:06.720]  is a little rough on the edge, is the Mac App Store app is pretty rough.
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:12.160]  That's, that's been a frequent source of bugs. It's, it's just, it's just rough.
[1:48:12.160 --> 1:48:17.920]  It, the, the iPhone one is the least bad. The iPad one is kind of pretty bad.
[1:48:18.120 --> 1:48:23.280]  And the Mac one is really bad. But anyway, like all that stuff, it seems like,
[1:48:24.280 --> 1:48:29.280]  I don't think this is an instance of like this team needs 50 more engineers.
[1:48:29.680 --> 1:48:34.240]  I think it's an instance of Apple thinks this is good enough.
[1:48:34.760 --> 1:48:37.800]  And, and that's, that's what frustrates me about the App Store and, and it's
[1:48:37.800 --> 1:48:40.960]  various quality issues. And again, I'm not talking about, like, you know,
[1:48:40.960 --> 1:48:43.800]  the policies in this case. I'm actually talking about the store, like the
[1:48:43.800 --> 1:48:47.760]  actual App Store itself. Um, there are so many things they could do that would
[1:48:47.760 --> 1:48:51.200]  make it better that they seem to think they don't need to do.
[1:48:52.840 --> 1:48:55.920]  But, but overall, though, I, I think Apple's cloud services get a
[1:48:55.920 --> 1:49:02.280]  bummer app. I think if you look at what, what we do on our Apple devices,
[1:49:02.280 --> 1:49:07.240]  that rely on Apple's cloud services, uh, most of it just works fine.
[1:49:07.240 --> 1:49:11.640]  And it's, again, it's that error rate multiplier thing, like the, the, the
[1:49:11.640 --> 1:49:14.600]  edges stick out. And then we all scream and say, Apple's cloud service is
[1:49:14.600 --> 1:49:19.080]  suck. But the reality is like most of them, like the biggest, as far as I know,
[1:49:19.240 --> 1:49:23.280]  what I would expect at least, the, the biggest Apple cloud service is the
[1:49:23.280 --> 1:49:27.840]  system that delivers push notifications and I message. And that works
[1:49:27.840 --> 1:49:31.440]  extremely well. And if you think about the scale of that operating on,
[1:49:31.440 --> 1:49:35.840]  that's insane. Like the, the, the, the amount of messages that get delivered.
[1:49:35.840 --> 1:49:39.720]  And like all my interactions with that service as a developer, like the,
[1:49:39.720 --> 1:49:44.160]  the servers that, that take in push requests are just lightning fast.
[1:49:44.160 --> 1:49:48.440]  Like it, it will take requests as quickly as your network can stream them to
[1:49:48.440 --> 1:49:53.320]  it. It, it, and it never fails. I've never had a connection error report
[1:49:53.320 --> 1:49:56.840]  by any of those tasks that run on my servers. Like, at least one that wasn't
[1:49:56.840 --> 1:50:02.600]  my fault on my network. It is ridiculous how well that system works.
[1:50:02.600 --> 1:50:05.760]  Uh, from what I've heard cloud kit works. I mean, I haven't used it yet,
[1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:08.800]  but when I've heard cloud kit works, like all, like this, this new
[1:50:08.800 --> 1:50:10.840]  infrastructure that they're building, that they built cloud kit on,
[1:50:10.840 --> 1:50:14.120]  that they're building all the photo library stuff on, all the indications so
[1:50:14.120 --> 1:50:17.080]  far. It is a little early, but all the indications so far say that that's rock
[1:50:17.080 --> 1:50:22.880]  solid. So it does seem like most of their cloud services do work and are
[1:50:22.880 --> 1:50:26.040]  solid. But you know, you definitely hear about the ones that don't.
[1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:30.000]  Yeah. Yeah. So I think the people who are holding that stuff up as examples
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:33.800]  of this are, are I think they're wrong. Let me take a break. And I want to
[1:50:33.800 --> 1:50:36.000]  talk, I guess the last thing we could talk about would be the annual
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:41.320]  schedule. Um, and maybe we can talk about that, uh, crazy new MacBook that
[1:50:41.320 --> 1:50:45.680]  Mark German says is coming. That's gonna be weird. Um, you know what, both
[1:50:45.680 --> 1:50:49.440]  gonna buy one. No, I don't want to know, because I just bought a MacBook
[1:50:49.440 --> 1:50:54.040]  Pro. You say that now? No, I just, I, I've, my MacBook Pro is, is what I
[1:50:54.040 --> 1:50:57.760]  want. Well, do you still have your 11 inch? I do. I'm actually recording this,
[1:50:57.760 --> 1:51:05.040]  but all I literally all I use it for is to record the show and to take a look
[1:51:05.040 --> 1:51:10.200]  at anything. It's still running, um, 10.9. So to take a look at anything in the
[1:51:10.200 --> 1:51:13.880]  old UI that I want to, what was it like when you, what do we do before your
[1:51:13.880 --> 1:51:17.360]  somebody? Right. The only two things I use this machine. Does it look totally
[1:51:17.360 --> 1:51:21.840]  garish and outdated now? Yes. Absolutely. It's been, it's been such a short time.
[1:51:22.040 --> 1:51:26.680]  Yeah. Looking at 10.9 is, oh my God, it's ridiculous. It's not quite as
[1:51:26.680 --> 1:51:31.280]  ridiculous as looking at pre iOS seven iOS, but it's because it's because
[1:51:31.280 --> 1:51:35.200]  they are, they never quite blinged or they, they de-blinged it at one point
[1:51:35.200 --> 1:51:39.320]  and left it there. It's even worse when like, so now that, so you now use a
[1:51:39.320 --> 1:51:44.040]  retina, I'm at full time, right? Right. So, uh, how bad is it when you see a
[1:51:44.040 --> 1:51:48.800]  non retina screen? That's well, my 11 inch has, has the non retina screen.
[1:51:48.800 --> 1:51:53.440]  And it's like, yeah, like I did, I got a Mac mini for some, some auxiliary
[1:51:53.440 --> 1:51:58.920]  duties here. It's, it runs headless, but we have, we have an old 27 inch, uh,
[1:51:58.960 --> 1:52:02.400]  LED, whatever cinema display in the closet. So I took that out to set it up.
[1:52:02.800 --> 1:52:06.960]  And so I had, I kept going back, back and forth between my 27 inch retina, I
[1:52:06.960 --> 1:52:10.520]  Mac and the 27 inch Thunderbolt display, which at the time it came out was
[1:52:10.520 --> 1:52:13.720]  an amazing display. They still sell it. It's now, well, now it's Thunderbolt.
[1:52:13.720 --> 1:52:19.160]  I have the pre one anyway. Right. It's an insane display. Yeah. Like, incredibly
[1:52:19.160 --> 1:52:21.760]  good, like bright, nice colors, great, you know, great brightness, great
[1:52:21.760 --> 1:52:25.680]  contrast, like by all specs, it is an amazing display. I mean, it came out.
[1:52:25.680 --> 1:52:29.360]  I remember like I had some other like HP monitor and I looked at, I looked at
[1:52:29.360 --> 1:52:31.720]  the two, I'm like, oh my God, my HP monitor looks like crap compared to this
[1:52:31.720 --> 1:52:36.120]  wonderful Apple monitor. And now that I have, you know, the retina version of
[1:52:36.120 --> 1:52:40.400]  that same thing, basically, uh, going between the two as I was sitting up
[1:52:40.400 --> 1:52:44.520]  the, like the first time I saw the, the Thunderbolt one, the, the non retina
[1:52:44.520 --> 1:52:47.800]  one, I'm like, oh, is this the wrong resolution? Like, what is, what is wrong
[1:52:47.800 --> 1:52:51.560]  with this? It looks terrible. Like, what, oh my God, this was normal. I looked at
[1:52:51.560 --> 1:52:57.120]  this all day. Like, it's, it's, it sounds awful, but it's, it's such a, it's
[1:52:57.120 --> 1:53:01.480]  such a difference. But yeah, I would imagine, you know, like looking back at
[1:53:01.480 --> 1:53:05.600]  Mavericks, once you're accustomed to Yosemite, it probably looks quite
[1:53:05.600 --> 1:53:08.960]  ridiculous. Yeah. The other thing that makes me think I might not like, if,
[1:53:08.960 --> 1:53:11.960]  assuming that the german thing is true, that well, we'll talk about it in a
[1:53:11.960 --> 1:53:16.480]  second. Yeah. But I don't, I don't think I would like the, the keyboard. I
[1:53:16.480 --> 1:53:19.000] 'm concerned, yeah, because it's too close together, right? Yeah. And that's the
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  thing I never liked about my 11 inch air. And not that, not, I don't even know
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:24.880]  if it's close enough, but they doesn't have the key travel that the bigger
[1:53:24.880 --> 1:53:30.200]  power books do. And it's one of the nice. No, well, at least mine didn't. I got
[1:53:30.200 --> 1:53:35.920]  the, my 11 inch air is the last air that doesn't have keys that light up.
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:39.200]  Yeah, you have the 2010. Yeah. It was the only one that ever. It was only like
[1:53:39.200 --> 1:53:43.560]  the, the first one did the 2008 old crappy one that did light up. Then the,
[1:53:43.560 --> 1:53:46.680]  the 2010 ones initially didn't, and then they brought it back in 2011. Now,
[1:53:46.680 --> 1:53:50.360]  the keys when you press them, don't go as far down as on other power books.
[1:53:50.640 --> 1:53:54.120]  And it's the nicest, probably the single nicest thing about the, well,
[1:53:54.120 --> 1:53:57.760]  the screens, the nicest thing, but the second nicest thing after the retina screen
[1:53:57.760 --> 1:54:02.080]  is the keyboard. I just totally news to me. I thought that they all use the same
[1:54:02.080 --> 1:54:04.560]  part, like all the, all the current Apple app. I thought the, I thought the
[1:54:04.560 --> 1:54:07.200]  keyboard was the exact same and all of them. You know, and for obvious reasons,
[1:54:07.200 --> 1:54:11.520]  the main thing I use a power book for instead of, I still call them power books.
[1:54:11.520 --> 1:54:15.600]  The main thing I use a MacBook for instead of an iPad in any situation is
[1:54:15.640 --> 1:54:19.040]  typing. Right. Right. The nice keyboard really. So I'm worried about that.
[1:54:19.080 --> 1:54:22.720]  Anyway, let me tell you about our third sponsor. It's another long time friend of
[1:54:22.720 --> 1:54:28.600]  the show. It's our friends at Harry's, Harry's sells high quality.
[1:54:28.640 --> 1:54:33.800]  I would say the highest quality men's shaving stuff. And they sell it at
[1:54:33.800 --> 1:54:39.280]  amazing prices. Um, the basic gist, you've heard the backstory, but the basic
[1:54:39.280 --> 1:54:43.120]  gist is that the founders of Harry's, uh, just ask themselves one day,
[1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:48.680]  why the hell is it so hard and so expensive to, uh, to buy razors? Why
[1:54:48.680 --> 1:54:52.040]  when you go into drugstore, do you have to find like a clerk who can unlock a
[1:54:52.040 --> 1:54:55.640]  glass cabinet and get it out? I mean, you know why they lock them up. It's a
[1:54:55.960 --> 1:55:00.200]  shoplifting, I guess. Uh, but it just makes buying the whole pain in the ass.
[1:55:00.440 --> 1:55:05.400]  And why is, why are the blade so expensive? Um, so they started a company to
[1:55:05.400 --> 1:55:10.680]  disrupt the market. Uh, and they take it super, super seriously. They bought
[1:55:10.680 --> 1:55:15.840]  their own razor blade factory in Germany. They found the razor blade factory
[1:55:15.840 --> 1:55:19.240]  making high quality blades. They bought it. They're making their own blades.
[1:55:19.240 --> 1:55:22.040]  It's not just some kind of white label, you know, they don't just scribble
[1:55:22.040 --> 1:55:25.280]  the name Harry's on a bunch of blades. They just buy it on the market.
[1:55:25.640 --> 1:55:30.640]  They buy high quality stuff. Uh, they make high quality stuff. The handles are
[1:55:30.640 --> 1:55:34.840]  great. Everything about the products is great. When you snap the blade into
[1:55:34.840 --> 1:55:39.440]  the handle as a nice click, it comes in a nice box. I've said before, I always
[1:55:39.440 --> 1:55:43.280]  feel terrible throwing away the Harry's box because it just likes like the
[1:55:43.280 --> 1:55:46.720]  type of box. It's like an Apple box. Like nobody throws away their Apple boxes.
[1:55:47.440 --> 1:55:52.320]  And, but then I think one down my, my, my, my bathroom is filled with empty
[1:55:52.320 --> 1:55:58.320]  Harry's boxes. But trust me, that's how good this stuff is. Um, really great
[1:55:58.320 --> 1:56:02.600]  stuff. They've got good shaving cream aftershave stuff that smells good. Uh,
[1:56:02.600 --> 1:56:06.120]  they've slowly but surely since they've started, they've started expanding
[1:56:06.120 --> 1:56:08.880]  their range of stuff where they've got a couple of more options. So if you
[1:56:08.880 --> 1:56:12.480]  checked them out a while ago, uh, it's worth looking at Harry's dot com and
[1:56:12.480 --> 1:56:17.160]  see some of the new products that they have that are relatively new. Um, but
[1:56:17.160 --> 1:56:21.960]  the main thing is their starter kit is just 15 bucks. That's a razor, three
[1:56:21.960 --> 1:56:27.120]  blades in your choice of either their shave cream or the foaming shave gel. Um,
[1:56:27.840 --> 1:56:31.880]  and when you buy new blades, this is where it really kicks in. It's about
[1:56:31.880 --> 1:56:36.640]  half the price of like the top stuff from Gillette or Shik or whatever. Just go
[1:56:36.640 --> 1:56:40.040]  to Amazon, go to Amazon and like price compare, like what a replacement
[1:56:40.040 --> 1:56:45.200]  set of five blades from Gillette costs compared to Harry's. And it's literally
[1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:51.640]  about, you know, give or take 50%. You know, it's a factor of two X. Um,
[1:56:51.840 --> 1:56:54.560]  and you have the convenience where you just order online, you don't have to
[1:56:54.560 --> 1:56:57.360]  go into the store or anything like that. It just shows up at your house when
[1:56:57.360 --> 1:57:01.160]  you need them. Um, really can't say how nice it is. It's just a great
[1:57:01.160 --> 1:57:06.040]  experience, great product. Uh, and, you know, everybody has to shave
[1:57:06.040 --> 1:57:07.160]  something. So
[1:57:08.200 --> 1:57:11.480]  there's a motto for the year. Yeah. So where do you go to find out more? Go to
[1:57:11.480 --> 1:57:19.000]  Harries.com, H A R R Y S dot com and use the code talk show. Know the just
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:24.040]  talk show and I forget what their deal is, but you'll save some bucks. Five bucks
[1:57:24.040 --> 1:57:29.920]  off your first order. That's it. Five bucks off your first order. Um, so my
[1:57:29.920 --> 1:57:33.800]  thanks to Harry's great product talk show is the code. You'll save five bucks.
[1:57:33.800 --> 1:57:38.680]  So I guess, wait, you get the kit for just 10 bucks? I think so. That's crazy.
[1:57:38.960 --> 1:57:42.360]  It's a great product. You'll can't believe that you buy it for even for 15
[1:57:42.360 --> 1:57:47.760]  bucks. You just can't believe that it does 15 bucks. Great company. So the
[1:57:47.760 --> 1:57:56.080]  annual schedule, that's who shit. I guess it's for. Hold on a second. I got
[1:57:56.080 --> 1:58:01.760]  to lead some podcasts here. That's fine. All right. Um, I want to talk about
[1:58:01.760 --> 1:58:06.760]  the annual schedule, which I think is for Yosemite and iOS, which they've
[1:58:06.760 --> 1:58:10.280]  stuck to for a couple of years. And there's a source for this trend that
[1:58:10.280 --> 1:58:14.800]  we're seeing. And I think part of this too is sort of from within Apple is
[1:58:14.800 --> 1:58:19.880]  sort of, uh, they can't win scenario because in the early years of the
[1:58:19.880 --> 1:58:25.920]  iPhone 2007, 2008, the Mac, they admit it. They even had like a press release
[1:58:25.920 --> 1:58:30.840]  the one time they had to publicly say we pulled engineers from Mac OS 10 to
[1:58:30.840 --> 1:58:35.240]  help get the new iOS 2.0 out the door. Right. That was lesser. Right. Yeah.
[1:58:35.240 --> 1:58:39.680]  So we're delaying the Mac OS to October. I think it was supposed to come
[1:58:39.680 --> 1:58:44.800]  out at WWDC in June. And it's now it's not coming out to October. Um, you
[1:58:44.800 --> 1:58:48.640]  know, Steve Jobs even had his name on it. You know, you know that that, you know
[1:58:48.640 --> 1:58:52.480]  that that hurt them to have to say something like that. Um, yeah, but like
[1:58:52.480 --> 1:58:57.440]  nothing bad happened as a result of that. No, but there I'm not even saying
[1:58:57.440 --> 1:59:01.840]  something bad happened for it. I'm just saying, no, that I feel like within Apple,
[1:59:01.840 --> 1:59:06.000]  they're like proud of the fact that they've gotten to the point where they
[1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:12.480]  can do, uh, keep both OS's in states of constant development. You know,
[1:59:12.480 --> 1:59:19.880]  well, can they? Well, I don't think either Yosemite or iOS 8 is so bad that
[1:59:19.880 --> 1:59:24.000]  I wish I hadn't upgraded. No, they're not. And that's, that's, that's the
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:27.880]  problem. Like it's at maybe, maybe this is, maybe this is part of the problem.
[1:59:27.880 --> 1:59:31.880]  Like they're not bad enough that like alarm bells are going off. Right.
[1:59:32.120 --> 1:59:37.280]  But the, the rate of tiny paper cuts seems to be increasing. Yeah. And I
[1:59:37.280 --> 1:59:41.040]  don't know. Like is it, is it, you know, if they're going to do that, is this
[1:59:41.040 --> 1:59:46.280]  the in it? Is this the way it has to be? You know, is there no way to either
[1:59:46.280 --> 1:59:49.920]  they slow down one or the other operating systems or this is what we're going
[1:59:49.920 --> 1:59:54.600]  to get? I got to know. Well, I don't think a slowing down would necessarily
[1:59:54.600 --> 1:59:59.240]  be that bad. I mean, you know, I'm right now we're going through a future,
[1:59:59.280 --> 2:00:02.520]  a few big transitions in the OS's. And we've been going through them over
[2:00:02.520 --> 2:00:06.280]  the last couple of releases where, you know, iOS seven was the massive
[2:00:06.280 --> 2:00:10.600]  redesign in addition to a whole bunch of new frameworks under the hood. Um,
[2:00:10.600 --> 2:00:14.360]  iOS eight out of the whole extension system, which is a pretty
[2:00:14.360 --> 2:00:19.000]  substantial thing. Well, and the whole, the whole idea of having these cross
[2:00:19.040 --> 2:00:23.280]  inner inner application, not just extensions in particular, extensions
[2:00:23.280 --> 2:00:27.120]  are like one version of it. But the way that so much of how we interact
[2:00:27.120 --> 2:00:33.360]  with the system is going through these, um, you know, the XPC thing. Yeah.
[2:00:33.360 --> 2:00:37.440]  The XPC stuff. Yeah. And so instead of having things that run in your app,
[2:00:37.440 --> 2:00:41.280]  and if they go bad crash your app, they're outside your app in a sandbox.
[2:00:41.400 --> 2:00:45.960]  And it's, it's not just one thing like sharing extensions. It's a whole bunch
[2:00:45.960 --> 2:00:49.360]  of things. It's a big transition. Right. And so like, so they're going
[2:00:49.360 --> 2:00:54.040]  through transitions like that. Uh, you know, they, so maybe the last few
[2:00:54.040 --> 2:00:58.280]  releases have just been bigger than, than their releases will usually be,
[2:00:58.480 --> 2:01:02.160]  you know, maybe this problem will, will settle down in the next couple of
[2:01:02.160 --> 2:01:06.240]  releases just by nature of they've now, they've, they're now on the other
[2:01:06.240 --> 2:01:10.680]  side of these giant transitions. But and, and like, you know, when you
[2:01:10.680 --> 2:01:14.960]  call something a stable release, some part of it is just like a marketing
[2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:17.160]  value. Some part of it is like, you know, we're going to declare this
[2:01:17.160 --> 2:01:21.960]  X point zero. And that's just a number doesn't mean anything. Um, but
[2:01:21.960 --> 2:01:26.320]  so, and so you could always choose to just put less in each one and, and
[2:01:26.320 --> 2:01:29.800]  still kind of have the best of both worlds. But some part of it also is
[2:01:29.800 --> 2:01:32.840]  like what Guy was saying, like the, the, the way, like the, the whole
[2:01:32.840 --> 2:01:37.120]  development pace of like how, how the year is spent, how the time between
[2:01:37.120 --> 2:01:40.560]  releases is spent, um, between like, you know, launching, fixing the
[2:01:40.560 --> 2:01:43.760]  bugs, then, you know, kind of quite period where you start developing the
[2:01:43.760 --> 2:01:46.840]  next stuff, and then, and then, you know, beta for the next thing, and then
[2:01:46.840 --> 2:01:51.200]  launch the next thing. Um, that will still be a problem. That will still be
[2:01:51.200 --> 2:01:55.880]  this compressed version, uh, even if you just do less in each version. I
[2:01:55.880 --> 2:01:58.640]  still think it'll be better than what you have now doing a lot in each
[2:01:58.640 --> 2:02:02.160]  version and release them every year. I also, you know, it's important to
[2:02:02.160 --> 2:02:06.680]  point out for the marketing value of this, that this is a pretty young
[2:02:06.680 --> 2:02:12.480]  thing. It isn't young for iPhones necessarily. Um, you know, most iPhones
[2:02:12.480 --> 2:02:16.320]  have coins have coincided with new iOS releases or at least been fairly
[2:02:16.320 --> 2:02:21.200]  close to them. Um, but they don't, first of all, they don't have to be. No, I
[2:02:21.200 --> 2:02:23.640]  think there's always been, I don't think there's ever been an iPhone that
[2:02:23.640 --> 2:02:27.720]  hasn't coincided with a new iOS. It's just that I think your I guess
[2:02:27.720 --> 2:02:30.320]  couldn't think of, I couldn't think of the earlier ones. No, there's never
[2:02:30.320 --> 2:02:34.840]  been, and they've never been one that can run the old OS. And some of
[2:02:34.840 --> 2:02:40.240]  them, like in the iOS three iOS four era were not so heavily new
[2:02:40.240 --> 2:02:44.360]  features. And, you know, it was a little bit more, you know, just
[2:02:44.360 --> 2:02:49.480]  expanding the foundation. But it was always a new 0.0 to coincide with
[2:02:49.480 --> 2:02:53.200]  the new phone. Right. But, but in sometimes they haven't been that
[2:02:53.200 --> 2:02:57.480]  way, like iPads, like the famous of the first iPad shipped with iOS
[2:02:57.480 --> 2:03:01.880]  3.2. It was a special build, a special track for the iPad that wasn't
[2:03:01.920 --> 2:03:06.560]  unified until iOS 4.2, I think, or 4.1. It was, it was even iOS
[2:03:06.560 --> 2:03:10.480]  four. Right. First on the iPhone wasn't didn't even run on the iPad. And
[2:03:10.480 --> 2:03:14.560]  then four, one or four points to unify them. Um, so like they have released
[2:03:14.560 --> 2:03:18.760]  heart. And so much of the recent high profile hardware has launched with
[2:03:18.760 --> 2:03:23.880]  new OS versions, but not all of it has. And when it hasn't, nothing bad
[2:03:23.880 --> 2:03:28.680]  happened. Like, there was, there was no real downside to the iPad shipping
[2:03:28.720 --> 2:03:32.760]  with 3.2 instead of waiting for 4.0 to be ready to ship this hardware
[2:03:32.760 --> 2:03:37.680]  product. There was also no major downside to the iPad, not even getting
[2:03:37.680 --> 2:03:41.920]  4.0 because it wasn't ready yet. Right. And like, you know, a few
[2:03:41.920 --> 2:03:45.240]  people complained, but it wasn't, it wasn't a huge deal. It didn't hurt the
[2:03:45.240 --> 2:03:47.880]  sales of the iPad, really. It didn't hurt the iPhone. It didn't hurt
[2:03:47.880 --> 2:03:51.160]  iOS four. Like, it just didn't, it wasn't a big deal. Right.
[2:03:51.160 --> 2:03:54.960]  Famously, the iPad in particular had more explosive sales in those
[2:03:54.960 --> 2:03:57.960]  early years than it has now. Now they've stuck, you know, flat. Right.
[2:03:57.960 --> 2:04:01.880]  Exactly. And not only for other reasons, but still. Right. So, and, you
[2:04:01.880 --> 2:04:07.000]  know, Max are released all the time. And if, if, if a new version of Mac OS
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:12.080]  10 is going to be due soon, they'll, they'll usually hold it. Same, like,
[2:04:12.080 --> 2:04:15.200]  like they did with the Red and I Mac, they'll usually hold it for that, for
[2:04:15.200 --> 2:04:19.040]  that same event. And then they'll ship together. But, you know, a Mac could
[2:04:19.040 --> 2:04:22.680]  be released next month. And it'll run the OS that's from four months
[2:04:22.680 --> 2:04:25.920]  ago or five months ago or whatever. And it doesn't matter. Nothing, nothing
[2:04:25.920 --> 2:04:28.560]  bad happens. You know, no one says, oh, Apple should have released a new
[2:04:28.560 --> 2:04:31.560]  OS with these new MacBook Airs. Like, nope, doesn't matter at all. Doesn't
[2:04:31.560 --> 2:04:36.720]  even come up. So, I question, like, the value of having this, this, like,
[2:04:36.720 --> 2:04:42.120]  lockstep of, of major OS's tied to major hardware releases, I think is
[2:04:42.120 --> 2:04:45.840]  mostly self-imposed. I think they do it that way because they like to do it
[2:04:45.840 --> 2:04:49.520]  that way or they think they should do it that way. But when it hasn't gone
[2:04:49.520 --> 2:04:52.920]  that way, I think the market has spoken loud and clear that it doesn't really
[2:04:52.920 --> 2:04:57.400]  matter. Yeah, I kind of agree with that. I do, you know, and I don't think that
[2:04:57.400 --> 2:05:01.840]  it's as superficial as that they want to do it so that they have more to show
[2:05:01.840 --> 2:05:07.320]  in a keynote. But, you know, I think there's something loosely along those
[2:05:07.320 --> 2:05:12.000]  lines though where they, they, you know, it's easier, easier to market when
[2:05:12.000 --> 2:05:18.040]  there's more new features. Right. And that's what I mean when I say that
[2:05:18.400 --> 2:05:23.000]  marketing is becoming too high of a priority. It's, it's not that, like, because
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:25.480]  and that, you know, one of the things that bother me, like I never said the
[2:05:25.480 --> 2:05:29.960]  marketing department, because I, what I didn't want to say is like,
[2:05:30.200 --> 2:05:33.440]  Phil Schiller is personally controlling Apple and killing credit for
[2:05:33.440 --> 2:05:35.640]  credit for credit for these goals. Like, because that's not what, that's not
[2:05:35.640 --> 2:05:39.560]  what I meant. I mean that the, the idea of marketing, the, the marketing
[2:05:39.560 --> 2:05:43.680]  benefits of this annual schedule end of lock stepping them with the
[2:05:43.680 --> 2:05:48.400]  hardware, that is too high of a priority. That is taking priority, seemingly
[2:05:48.400 --> 2:05:52.200]  over software quality. And that is what I have a problem with. And, and that
[2:05:52.200 --> 2:05:55.960]  is not a departmental thing, as far as I know, you know, I don't, I don't
[2:05:55.960 --> 2:05:59.240]  think, you know, Phil Schiller is personally taking over the company and
[2:05:59.240 --> 2:06:03.760]  having these battles there. I seriously doubt that. I think it's like, the
[2:06:03.760 --> 2:06:09.000]  company has decided as a whole at the high level, like this, this schedule is, is
[2:06:09.000 --> 2:06:12.200]  right for the company. This is what we're going to do. We're going to, we're
[2:06:12.200 --> 2:06:15.440]  going to have these annual releases. We're going to, you know, tie these
[2:06:15.440 --> 2:06:18.840]  things lock steps so that hardware releases with software. Yeah. And I've
[2:06:18.840 --> 2:06:23.000]  always said, you know, I think you just, your point is well put. And I, I've
[2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:28.560]  always said that marketing and Apple doesn't work like it does it a lot of
[2:06:28.560 --> 2:06:31.080]  other companies. I don't know about most other companies. I don't know, but
[2:06:31.080 --> 2:06:35.800]  I think the traditional way we're marketing is like icing on the cake. And
[2:06:35.800 --> 2:06:38.360]  it's like products go through development. And when you're done being
[2:06:38.360 --> 2:06:42.480]  developed, they hand them over to marketing and marketing figures out a box
[2:06:42.480 --> 2:06:47.560]  and a tagline and finishes it. You know, it's, it's better. I've always said
[2:06:47.560 --> 2:06:52.320]  like one way to think of it is it'd be better to better understand Phil Schiller's
[2:06:52.320 --> 2:06:56.000]  responsibilities if you took the word marketing out of his title and just
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:07:01.400]  thought of him as senior vice president of product. Exactly. It's inextricably
[2:07:01.400 --> 2:07:06.480]  time, you know, the, the, the advertising of the products, the marketing of
[2:07:06.480 --> 2:07:11.920]  the products is inextricably tied to the development of the products from
[2:07:11.920 --> 2:07:17.160]  the, the get go. It's, it's one in the same. Right. Like they're not,
[2:07:17.160 --> 2:07:20.360]  they're not going to make a product that, that there's no clear market for
[2:07:20.360 --> 2:07:23.480]  or that doesn't fit into their marketing and message as a whole. Right. And
[2:07:23.480 --> 2:07:28.960]  they're, that makes their marketing. Well, I think refreshingly honest that
[2:07:28.960 --> 2:07:33.360]  what they are bragging about, about their products is usually true. I mean,
[2:07:33.360 --> 2:07:37.920]  most of their marketing is like, here is what our product is period. Like
[2:07:37.920 --> 2:07:41.200]  that's, they don't need to do that much more than that. Look, like when the
[2:07:41.200 --> 2:07:44.400]  MacBook Air first came out and they, you know, they had to add where it came
[2:07:44.400 --> 2:07:48.480]  out of an envelope and they were like, look at this laptop. It's crazy thin
[2:07:48.480 --> 2:07:52.200]  and crazy light. Well, that's exactly what it was. Yeah. You know, there was no,
[2:07:52.200 --> 2:07:58.360]  no spin on it, no lie. You know, um, yeah, but we'll get to it in a few minutes.
[2:07:58.360 --> 2:08:05.280]  But yeah, but yeah, so I mean, I think the, the annual review cycle, I think,
[2:08:05.280 --> 2:08:09.880]  is a major part of the quality problems. The quality decline did, I think,
[2:08:09.880 --> 2:08:13.240]  proceed it. Because the annual review cycle is pretty young. I mean, what
[2:08:13.240 --> 2:08:17.680]  do they start that with lion? Or when they went, I think when they went from
[2:08:17.680 --> 2:08:20.360]  lion to mountain lion, I think that was the first one year and if it wasn't
[2:08:20.360 --> 2:08:27.120]  it? Yeah, it was a little bit more than a year. It was, um, I'm looking at the
[2:08:27.120 --> 2:08:35.800]  Wikipedia page now. Mac OS 10, 10.7 lion shipped in October 2010 and mountain
[2:08:35.800 --> 2:08:41.040]  lion was announced February 2012. That was February 2012. That was the one
[2:08:41.040 --> 2:08:45.400]  where they had like the private briefings, like, like, rhyme. Right. Is that the one
[2:08:45.400 --> 2:08:47.800]  where Shiller told you we're going to do anything to differently now? Yeah.
[2:08:47.800 --> 2:08:51.560]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like that, I think that was when this started was, was roughly
[2:08:51.560 --> 2:08:54.160]  then, you know, I think that's what they meant. They're doing things to
[2:08:54.160 --> 2:08:57.920]  differently, you know, in a few ways. But so, you know, that, you know, and I
[2:08:57.920 --> 2:09:02.280]  should say, yeah, I maybe I, I overemphasized the cyclical nature of Apple.
[2:09:02.280 --> 2:09:06.320]  We've really only had two releases that follow the current cycle of a June
[2:09:06.320 --> 2:09:11.160]  announcement in October debut. Right. iOS has been more consistent because
[2:09:11.160 --> 2:09:13.520]  the phone schedule has been pretty much the same. I mean, you know, it
[2:09:13.520 --> 2:09:15.840]  shifted from June to September or whatever. But otherwise, it's pretty
[2:09:15.840 --> 2:09:19.720]  much the same. Yeah. Getting a summer to end of summer. Right. Exactly. But yeah,
[2:09:19.720 --> 2:09:23.880]  overall, you know, iPhone has been consistent. It's only really a Mac that has
[2:09:23.880 --> 2:09:28.160]  become inconsistent recently. Right. Right. And that is, that is now consistent.
[2:09:28.160 --> 2:09:33.080]  Yeah. And it used to be annual in the early years because it was so bad and
[2:09:33.080 --> 2:09:38.320]  needed so much improvement. Well, it was young. Yeah. Like now, it like, I don't
[2:09:38.320 --> 2:09:42.960]  see that as a Mac user, I don't really see a lot of value in
[2:09:43.480 --> 2:09:49.080]  revenue, the main OS I use for all of my work frequently. Like, I don't see the
[2:09:49.080 --> 2:09:52.560]  point. Like the only reason I got Yosemite when I did was it bought a new
[2:09:52.560 --> 2:09:56.040]  computer that came with it. I would have waited probably until like a
[2:09:56.040 --> 2:09:59.720]  point to most likely before I installed it. I never installed it on my old
[2:09:59.720 --> 2:10:02.760]  computer. Right. I only, I only got it because the new computer came with it
[2:10:03.040 --> 2:10:08.840]  and can't be downgraded. And because like, I'm very risk averse with my work
[2:10:08.840 --> 2:10:12.760]  computer. Right. Like if I'm in the middle of a project, which I almost always
[2:10:12.760 --> 2:10:18.040]  am, I will put off any updates. Even even like an X point to or X point
[2:10:18.040 --> 2:10:21.640]  three, like I'll put that off until I'm like done editing the podcast for
[2:10:21.640 --> 2:10:24.080]  a week, just in case something bad happens, you know, something like that.
[2:10:24.280 --> 2:10:27.440]  Yeah, my way has always been to have a computer at my desk. That's my quote
[2:10:27.440 --> 2:10:32.680]  main computer. That's the IMac 5K. I'll keep that at a conservative pace and
[2:10:32.680 --> 2:10:37.840]  then have a laptop that I don't really give two crops about. If it, not that
[2:10:37.840 --> 2:10:41.120]  I'm care about it, but that I don't care if it gets buggy, right? I'll, that
[2:10:41.120 --> 2:10:45.000]  I'll install developer beta zone. Yeah, my laptop actually runs the, like the,
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:48.760]  it's, it's on the Yosemite beta chain, like through the app store. So it's
[2:10:48.760 --> 2:10:52.320]  currently on, on 10, 10, two or whatever it is. Yeah, and I regret it terribly.
[2:10:52.520 --> 2:10:55.320]  That actually, I mean, I hardly use that computer, but that's actually not
[2:10:55.320 --> 2:10:58.440]  been a problem for me. Yeah, well, there's one particular bug that really,
[2:10:58.440 --> 2:11:01.120]  it's driving me nuts. The dictionary, and I don't even know how
[2:11:01.120 --> 2:11:04.320]  universal is, but for me, at least, you know, the dictionary look up feature
[2:11:04.320 --> 2:11:07.920]  where you can do, uh, I've changed my shortcut. I think the standard one
[2:11:07.920 --> 2:11:11.520]  might be control command D. Oh, I, I always forget that. I still launch the
[2:11:11.520 --> 2:11:14.520]  dictionary app from spotlight every time or launch more. You know, this is a
[2:11:14.520 --> 2:11:19.280]  cool shortcut. You can triple tap on the trackpad over a word, not click,
[2:11:19.640 --> 2:11:23.680]  tap, right, right, triple tap. And you get an inline dictionary look up of
[2:11:23.680 --> 2:11:27.840]  whatever word you want. Use it all the time. That's great. It crashes Mars at
[2:11:27.840 --> 2:11:33.000]  it. It, it doesn't crash BB at it, but in BB at it, it leaves the yellow
[2:11:33.400 --> 2:11:38.400]  highlighted thing of the word on screen. Oh, that's, it's something change
[2:11:38.400 --> 2:11:41.280]  between 10, one and 10, two with third party apps in the dictionary look up.
[2:11:41.280 --> 2:11:45.200]  And I do it all the time. And I know, I know it's going to crash, but I
[2:11:45.200 --> 2:11:47.800]  don't think about it. I think I got to look, did I spill this right? Triple
[2:11:47.800 --> 2:11:52.840]  tapped it. Boom. Now, all the apps I use are like Mars at it and BB at it.
[2:11:52.840 --> 2:11:57.320]  They all auto save everything. So I don't lose data, but it's still an annoyance.
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:00.800]  Yeah. And it's just, this is the product. There's so many little things like
[2:12:00.800 --> 2:12:03.960]  that. I mean, but it's a beta. So I'm not complaining. Yeah, yeah, obviously.
[2:12:04.120 --> 2:12:08.200]  Here's the, here's the historical schedule for macOS 10. So 10.0 came out
[2:12:08.200 --> 2:12:12.960]  in early 2001. And that really even counts. It was a keep in pile of shit.
[2:12:12.960 --> 2:12:20.040]  And then 10, one came out in July. Um, later the same year, uh, went just
[2:12:20.040 --> 2:12:24.400]  from March to July. They came out with a, with a major version of Mac OS 10.
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:32.360]  Um, 10.2 was May 2002. 10.3 was June 2003. These are announcement dates,
[2:12:32.360 --> 2:12:36.960]  not release dates. I guess I should do release dates. Um, then we waited. I go
[2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:41.320]  almost two years for 10 for Tiger, which is really where I feel like they
[2:12:41.320 --> 2:12:45.360]  tied it off and we're like, okay, we're done with like the early years of
[2:12:45.400 --> 2:12:49.720]  Mac OS 10. Yeah, I came in with Tiger even went all the way to, Tiger went
[2:12:49.720 --> 2:12:54.640]  all the way to 10.4.11, which I think is the highest they ever got yet.
[2:12:54.640 --> 2:12:59.840]  It's the highest they ever got 10.6 only went to 10.68. Oh,
[2:12:59.960 --> 2:13:05.600]  but there was a Wikipedia lists a 10.68 V1.1, which is some kind of weird
[2:13:05.600 --> 2:13:11.040]  path. Um, but that's where they switched to like two years. And in fact,
[2:13:11.040 --> 2:13:16.880]  10 five didn't come out until October 26, 2007. That's the one that was a delayed
[2:13:16.880 --> 2:13:21.200]  one, the delayed one. So it was about two and a half years. Um, and that was a
[2:13:21.200 --> 2:13:25.080]  really stable time, by the way. Yeah, it's this, I think is the high water
[2:13:25.080 --> 2:13:29.800]  mark that, you know, and again, like as jouquet had a web, a web blog post in
[2:13:29.800 --> 2:13:35.480]  response to your thing, you know, don't, don't use too much, you know,
[2:13:35.480 --> 2:13:38.280]  don't have two classes. Yeah, rose colored glass. Yeah, exactly. Don't have
[2:13:38.280 --> 2:13:41.720]  too strong a prescription in your rose colored glasses. Right. Like all the
[2:13:41.720 --> 2:13:46.240]  people who would actually like web OS. But, you know, I do think there's
[2:13:46.240 --> 2:13:50.440]  something to, you know, that it being a high water mark, this era, a high
[2:13:50.440 --> 2:13:55.600]  water mark for stability system wide. Um, yeah, I mean, everybody glorifies
[2:13:55.600 --> 2:13:59.720]  10 six also, uh, because that was the famous one that they said, no new
[2:13:59.720 --> 2:14:01.880]  features. We're just going to like, you know, work on the, work on the
[2:14:01.880 --> 2:14:06.360]  under the hood stuff. Right. And it was successful. And it was that brought in
[2:14:06.360 --> 2:14:08.800]  tons of modern stuff that brought in Grand Central dispatch among other
[2:14:08.800 --> 2:14:12.240]  things and included though included in the fact that it had no new features
[2:14:12.240 --> 2:14:17.480]  is it was two years after 10 five leopard came out. So it was two years
[2:14:17.480 --> 2:14:23.240]  since the release. It was, this is, you know, it was released in 2009. Um,
[2:14:24.160 --> 2:14:28.440]  this is interesting. It was announced in June 2008, but didn't get released
[2:14:28.440 --> 2:14:32.240]  until August 2009. I don't remember that. Do you remember it being a year in
[2:14:32.240 --> 2:14:36.200]  beta? No, but it doesn't matter. Well, I don't know. If it's on Wikipedia,
[2:14:36.200 --> 2:14:41.520]  it's got to be true. Of course. Um, but it was two years and had no new
[2:14:41.520 --> 2:14:45.440]  features. And it was two years until we got lying. So there was like this
[2:14:45.440 --> 2:14:48.480]  four year period. And again, no new features is kind of bullshit. I mean,
[2:14:48.480 --> 2:14:52.360]  like adding Grand Central dispatch, it's not a feature because it's not
[2:14:52.360 --> 2:14:55.920]  like a thing that they can put in a commercial, but right. It's clearly, you
[2:14:55.920 --> 2:15:00.640]  know, a huge feature. It's just a behind the scenes developer feature. Um,
[2:15:00.680 --> 2:15:04.440]  but that's like a four year period where they didn't really have a lot of
[2:15:04.480 --> 2:15:09.680]  user facing features added and is widely viewed. And I think accurately,
[2:15:09.680 --> 2:15:15.120]  so it's sort of the high water mark of stability. Yeah. And, and, you know,
[2:15:15.120 --> 2:15:18.480]  part of that could be rosecoat glasses, but I think there is a lot of truth
[2:15:18.480 --> 2:15:22.640]  to that. Yeah. We might see something like that soon. No, like you said,
[2:15:22.640 --> 2:15:26.360]  they're going through transitions now. And it's, you know, iCloud is
[2:15:26.360 --> 2:15:29.760]  certainly one of them. I think the other transition they're going through is
[2:15:29.760 --> 2:15:37.240]  this general idea of iOS and Mac being siblings. Right. Like, uh, you know,
[2:15:37.760 --> 2:15:41.960]  it tied together. The best example of that best example is gotta be the I
[2:15:41.960 --> 2:15:45.680]  work, the new versions of all the I work apps. We're now they're saying these
[2:15:45.680 --> 2:15:49.960]  are the exact same file formats between the two, even if that means that the
[2:15:49.960 --> 2:15:53.600]  Mac version is going to lose a bunch of cool features. You know, and
[2:15:53.640 --> 2:15:57.400]  eventually, presumably they're going to get them, get those features back,
[2:15:57.400 --> 2:16:01.120]  but then we'll have them on both platforms. We'll have, you know, nice
[2:16:01.120 --> 2:16:07.600]  curning for fonts on iOS in addition to Mac. And that's a perfect example,
[2:16:07.600 --> 2:16:12.400]  but they're doing that in little ways in a bunch of apps. Right. And a lot of,
[2:16:12.440 --> 2:16:15.200]  a lot of the underlying frameworks are also being unified. A lot of the
[2:16:15.200 --> 2:16:18.880]  underlying API stuff, the SDKs, a lot of that has been unified in the last couple
[2:16:18.880 --> 2:16:23.840]  of releases. They've both gone through the major visual redesigns, more
[2:16:23.840 --> 2:16:27.320]  so on iOS, but still, you know, somebody's no, no slouch in that department.
[2:16:27.320 --> 2:16:31.400]  So they have gone through a lot in the last couple of years.
[2:16:31.520 --> 2:16:34.400]  And I don't expect either of those things to happen again any time soon,
[2:16:34.400 --> 2:16:37.840]  either. I think we're at least five, six, seven years from either OS
[2:16:37.840 --> 2:16:41.720]  getting a major visual refresh. Right. Other, you know, just an annual
[2:16:41.720 --> 2:16:46.760]  tightening up. Yeah. Swift gives me a little bit of pause, because, you know,
[2:16:46.760 --> 2:16:51.560]  right now, like, Swift was announced, nothing written inside of Apple was
[2:16:51.560 --> 2:16:55.720]  using Swift yet. And none of the frameworks you Swift natively, none of them
[2:16:55.720 --> 2:17:00.480]  are written in Swift natively, at least not as of last year. So, you know,
[2:17:00.480 --> 2:17:04.760]  introducing a whole new programming language that certainly begs for a lot
[2:17:04.760 --> 2:17:09.360]  of things to be rewritten in it. That might be a major thing that is
[2:17:09.560 --> 2:17:14.160]  potentially a burden or distraction on the engineering teams. I also question
[2:17:14.160 --> 2:17:18.400]  whether that is what they should be doing with their time. But in general,
[2:17:18.400 --> 2:17:25.040]  though, I think the next couple of releases have very good reason to be less
[2:17:25.040 --> 2:17:33.080]  ambitious and more stable. Yeah. I hope so. Before we move on and talk about that
[2:17:33.080 --> 2:17:37.320]  MacBook thing, the other thought I had is that a lot of the complaints that
[2:17:37.320 --> 2:17:42.160]  I've seen with regard to these little nagging, it's supposed to just work,
[2:17:42.160 --> 2:17:48.320]  but it doesn't just work. A lot of it has to do with wireless networking and
[2:17:48.640 --> 2:17:52.160]  stuff that's supposed to happen between two devices. Like, for me, in particular,
[2:17:52.160 --> 2:17:56.600]  AirDrop is amazing. AirDrop works absolutely great. And I use it all the
[2:17:56.600 --> 2:18:00.360]  time, like, where I'm on the phone and I have, ooh, I want to link to this
[2:18:00.360 --> 2:18:03.440]  from Daring Fireball. And instead of doing what I used to do, it, like, send it
[2:18:03.440 --> 2:18:06.880]  to pin board or something and then go to my Mac and get it. I just AirDrop it
[2:18:06.880 --> 2:18:12.280]  to my Mac as soon as my Mac wakes up and it boom, it's there. And it's, there's
[2:18:12.280 --> 2:18:16.720]  nothing to clean up. I don't have to erase or let language forever and old
[2:18:16.720 --> 2:18:22.120]  pin board bookmark that I really just wanted to shuffle between the two. It's
[2:18:22.120 --> 2:18:26.360]  great. But I've heard from people who say AirDrop never works for that. But
[2:18:26.360 --> 2:18:30.480]  anyway, what gives me pause is that a lot of these things are these little nagging
[2:18:30.480 --> 2:18:34.120]  two things that are supposed to talk to each other over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi or
[2:18:34.120 --> 2:18:39.280]  whatever don't really quite work the way they're supposed to is that is the
[2:18:39.280 --> 2:18:45.120]  entire description of Apple Watch, right? It's like the sort of things that don't
[2:18:45.120 --> 2:18:49.720]  just work are the only things Apple Watch exists for. There's nothing else,
[2:18:49.720 --> 2:18:52.680]  there is other than telling time, there's nothing else the thing does other
[2:18:52.680 --> 2:18:59.600]  than these little wireless interactions sort of dancing all day long with
[2:18:59.600 --> 2:19:06.120]  other devices. I even thought earlier, like you can't even sink Apple Watch
[2:19:06.120 --> 2:19:11.840]  with a cable. No, like there's no ports on it. It can only charge everything else
[2:19:11.840 --> 2:19:16.560]  is wireless. So like, you know, this stuff has to be solved. One thing though, the
[2:19:16.560 --> 2:19:21.760]  Apple Watch, it can go either way. I think you can look at it from one side and
[2:19:21.760 --> 2:19:27.520]  you can say, well, this is going to be a brand new 1.0 of everything and it's
[2:19:27.520 --> 2:19:31.320]  going to be potentially a huge drain or engineering resources at Apple and
[2:19:31.320 --> 2:19:35.600]  focus from Apple, which could bode very poorly for their quality going
[2:19:35.600 --> 2:19:40.600]  forward. Or you can look at it as maybe the Apple Watch will take some of the
[2:19:40.600 --> 2:19:46.000]  marketing burden for a while and let them be a little more boring with the with iOS
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:50.520]  and OS 10. And poor enormous resources into things like getting the blue
[2:19:50.520 --> 2:19:56.880]  coat Bluetooth stack in really tip top shape. Right. Like, so I think this could
[2:19:56.880 --> 2:20:03.200]  this this is a wildcard. I think the watch. I don't I mean, again, this I could
[2:20:03.200 --> 2:20:07.360]  be wrong. I don't think the watch is going to require a massive amount of
[2:20:07.360 --> 2:20:11.400]  engineering of software engineering. It simply can't do that much at the hardware
[2:20:11.400 --> 2:20:16.480]  is very simple. You know, it, you know, relative to all the things iOS does
[2:20:16.480 --> 2:20:19.600]  for instance, all the things Mac OS 10 does. I don't think it's going to
[2:20:19.600 --> 2:20:24.520]  require massive engineering resources to to get it through its first, you
[2:20:24.520 --> 2:20:28.880]  know, a couple of years. Again, that could be totally wrong. I don't know. But
[2:20:28.880 --> 2:20:33.480]  just as a relative thing, I think it's probably a much smaller project. But
[2:20:33.480 --> 2:20:37.240]  it will and I also don't know how well it's going to sell. You know, it could
[2:20:37.240 --> 2:20:42.040]  end up being, you know, just like new iPods. Basically, like it could just be
[2:20:42.040 --> 2:20:46.040]  like it could disappoint a lot of analysts. It could disappoint Apple. It could
[2:20:46.040 --> 2:20:50.280]  sell, you know, a few million here there, you know, but but not set the
[2:20:50.280 --> 2:20:54.240]  wrong fire and not be ubiquitous among Apple people. Or it could set the
[2:20:54.240 --> 2:20:57.200]  wrong fire and it could sell tremendously and it could like we have no
[2:20:57.200 --> 2:21:00.880]  idea how it's going to sell yet. And I think that that might determine some
[2:21:00.880 --> 2:21:03.880]  of its few some of the companies future priorities and direction. I think
[2:21:03.880 --> 2:21:07.280]  the single single, I think it's if it works as advertised, it's going to
[2:21:07.280 --> 2:21:11.080]  sell very well. And I think the single thing that could sink it would be if it
[2:21:11.080 --> 2:21:15.640]  comes out in the next month or two, two months, whenever it's supposed to come out.
[2:21:15.640 --> 2:21:21.960]  And there's a bunch of little nagging bugs with the interactivity with your
[2:21:21.960 --> 2:21:25.920]  iPhone. And, you know, your text messages are supposed to be showing up on your
[2:21:25.920 --> 2:21:31.160]  wrist and they don't. Or it's not supposed to drain your battery. But when you
[2:21:31.160 --> 2:21:35.520]  sink, you know, when you have an I you know, you put your Apple watch on and your
[2:21:35.520 --> 2:21:39.160]  phone, which used to typically get you through the whole day, is in the red by
[2:21:39.160 --> 2:21:44.040]  noon. That's good. That would be a huge problem because it's not that they
[2:21:44.040 --> 2:21:48.680]  can't fix those bugs. It's that the perception will hit while it's young that
[2:21:48.680 --> 2:21:51.720]  the thing doesn't work like it's supposed to. And that sort of thing is very,
[2:21:51.720 --> 2:21:56.160]  very hard to shake. Oh, yeah. I mean, like if it becomes part of people's tech
[2:21:56.160 --> 2:21:59.760]  superstitions to like, oh, you better like only turn on Bluetooth when you're
[2:21:59.760 --> 2:22:01.760]  doing something in the watch and turn Bluetooth off on your phone to save your
[2:22:01.760 --> 2:22:04.680]  battery. Yeah, exactly. And that kind of stuff starts getting into like the
[2:22:04.680 --> 2:22:08.400]  culture as as common wisdom. You know, it could become the next quit all your
[2:22:08.400 --> 2:22:12.600]  apps thing where that's actively harmful. That's why I wrote when I linked to
[2:22:12.600 --> 2:22:17.000]  your thing that it's the perception, like to me, the biggest problem with this
[2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:22.680]  trend and the resonation that you're post got is that it's it by Apple leaving
[2:22:22.680 --> 2:22:27.880]  these things, you know, like as you put it, you know, leaving some ground at
[2:22:27.880 --> 2:22:32.320]  the functional leaving some of the area at the functional high ground, whatever
[2:22:32.320 --> 2:22:37.320]  you call it. Yeah. Not my best title ever, although I don't I disagree with your
[2:22:37.320 --> 2:22:41.800]  analysis that you have to lose the high ground to someone else. I think you
[2:22:41.800 --> 2:22:44.960]  can lose like, because if you think about the moral high ground, you can lose
[2:22:44.960 --> 2:22:49.680]  the moral high ground without someone else becoming better than you at it. You
[2:22:49.680 --> 2:22:53.880]  can just become worse out of yourself. Yeah, I I know what you mean. It's not
[2:22:53.880 --> 2:22:58.640]  quite it. It's not quite fair that I said it's that you have to lose it to
[2:22:58.640 --> 2:23:02.160]  him. I do think it's an important point. I worry though that the fact that
[2:23:02.160 --> 2:23:08.120]  that I thought that way, it occurred to me later, rethinking that that it could
[2:23:08.120 --> 2:23:11.600]  be a worrisome sign that if Apple people inside Apple see it the same way, well,
[2:23:11.600 --> 2:23:16.440]  who did we lose it to that you're blind to a problem. Right. And what I did see
[2:23:16.440 --> 2:23:20.920]  though, right away is that it's that to me is already a problem and is the
[2:23:20.920 --> 2:23:25.760]  fact that so many people seem to agree with you is a problem and it's the
[2:23:25.760 --> 2:23:30.360]  perception because and it doesn't matter whether we're overreacting or
[2:23:30.360 --> 2:23:34.640]  whether most people are. If it if that becomes the perception, it's hard for
[2:23:34.640 --> 2:23:39.200]  Apple to shake that. They can fix the bugs. They can significantly improve the
[2:23:39.200 --> 2:23:43.920]  quality of their platforms across the board and people won't notice because
[2:23:43.920 --> 2:23:48.720]  there's this perception that the stuff doesn't work right. And there's a lot
[2:23:48.720 --> 2:23:53.400]  of reasons why that perception is reasonable. If you look at, you know, the
[2:23:53.400 --> 2:23:57.400]  various issues people have had applying iOS updates over the last couple of
[2:23:57.400 --> 2:24:01.440]  years. If you look at how iOS updates have performed on old hardware over the
[2:24:01.440 --> 2:24:05.840]  last couple of years, a lot of people are understandably wary. They've gotten
[2:24:05.840 --> 2:24:09.360]  burned before. And and they like now they're like, well, I don't want to
[2:24:09.360 --> 2:24:12.640]  install the new update because I heard it broke some people's phones or broke
[2:24:12.640 --> 2:24:15.920]  my phone or it made my phone really slow. Well, the one that they pushed it was
[2:24:15.920 --> 2:24:18.440]  bad because there's always going to be bugs and there's always going to be
[2:24:18.440 --> 2:24:22.920]  there's always going to be weird, you know, who knows? Like a freaking ion from
[2:24:22.920 --> 2:24:27.320]  outer space hit your phone the wrong way and corrupts some part of the
[2:24:27.320 --> 2:24:32.360]  OS, you know, and if something in the flash memory gets corrupted and a software
[2:24:32.360 --> 2:24:37.200]  update bricks your phone and doesn't break your wife's phone. Well, you know,
[2:24:37.200 --> 2:24:41.600]  one in a one in 10,000 gets bricked by an update. Well, those sort of bugs
[2:24:41.600 --> 2:24:45.200]  happen. They suck, but they happen. You can't say you can never do that. But you
[2:24:45.200 --> 2:24:48.480]  I think it's fair to say you can never push out and over the air update that
[2:24:48.480 --> 2:24:52.920]  bricks every phone that takes it. Right. Like that just is that was just an
[2:24:52.920 --> 2:24:58.440]  inexcusable slip and creates again, this perception that when you see it, when
[2:24:58.440 --> 2:25:02.320]  your phone tells you, hey, there's a new iOS, you should not be worried. You
[2:25:02.320 --> 2:25:06.480]  shouldn't think, oh, again, you know, I know some people who don't, you know,
[2:25:06.480 --> 2:25:11.480]  they who just keep that red badge on, you know, the settings app because they
[2:25:11.480 --> 2:25:14.840]  don't want to install it. Oh, yeah. My mom's phone is still running iOS 6
[2:25:14.840 --> 2:25:18.800]  because when iOS 7 came out, she saw on the news about the motion sickness and
[2:25:18.800 --> 2:25:21.720]  she got scared and she refused to install iOS 7. She's never even seen it.
[2:25:21.720 --> 2:25:25.320]  All right, so she's just got a red badge on her on her. Yeah, in the last two
[2:25:25.320 --> 2:25:34.280]  years, she'll get it when she gets a new phone. Yeah. So funny. Anyway, I
[2:25:34.280 --> 2:25:37.880]  think that perception is important. And you know, I'll I'll relate it to the
[2:25:37.880 --> 2:25:42.680]  Newton and I know it was a very different apple in the 90s and they were so
[2:25:42.680 --> 2:25:47.800]  small and you know, something like the Newton appealed to so few people, but it
[2:25:47.800 --> 2:25:53.320]  was mainstream enough, you know, that everybody cites the dunesbury cartoon that
[2:25:53.320 --> 2:25:57.240]  made fun of it and the Simpsons made fun of it too. So I mean, it was popular
[2:25:57.240 --> 2:26:03.800]  enough that it was grist for Simpsons gags. It got that stink on it that the
[2:26:03.800 --> 2:26:08.120]  handwriting recognition doesn't work so that you could make dunesbury and
[2:26:08.120 --> 2:26:12.080]  Simpsons gags about it. It didn't take that long though before the handwriting
[2:26:12.080 --> 2:26:17.600]  got pretty darn good on, you know, like the message pad 2000. It was pretty, it
[2:26:17.600 --> 2:26:24.240]  was about as good as you could hope that like a 1995, 1996 computer could
[2:26:24.240 --> 2:26:28.480]  recognize your handwriting. It was really pretty good. Nobody really got
[2:26:28.480 --> 2:26:32.640]  everybody you'd say Newton, they'd say goofy terrible handwriting recognition.
[2:26:32.640 --> 2:26:39.040]  Well, most of them also had never tried one. No, but if if Apple watch comes out and
[2:26:39.040 --> 2:26:42.480]  in the first year, it seems like none of the stuff it's supposed to do works
[2:26:42.480 --> 2:26:48.800]  reliably. That'd be hard to shake even if they fix it. Yeah, it's true. Like it's
[2:26:48.800 --> 2:26:53.360]  really important that it that it does everything it's supposed to do pretty
[2:26:53.360 --> 2:26:57.120]  well. And again, that sounds like a stupid thing to say. It sounds like well
[2:26:57.120 --> 2:27:01.160]  everything you should do what it's supposed to do pretty well. But like with a
[2:27:01.160 --> 2:27:06.720]  new product, it's essential because the first impression is so much, it
[2:27:06.720 --> 2:27:12.480]  informs, you know, a decade of what you're going to think of it. Like the first
[2:27:12.480 --> 2:27:17.160]  iPhone, it was so important that it really was an amazing device. It really
[2:27:17.160 --> 2:27:21.080]  couldn't be a bad device. And there and there's a substantial number of people
[2:27:21.080 --> 2:27:26.080]  both who just who can't wait for Apple to fail so they can talk about it and
[2:27:26.080 --> 2:27:30.120]  make fun of it and point it out and laugh. And also a lot of people who are
[2:27:30.120 --> 2:27:33.560]  going to be looking for a reason are going to be looking for a reason for
[2:27:33.560 --> 2:27:38.520]  Apple not to fail somehow. They're like waiting for Apple to fail. And there's
[2:27:38.520 --> 2:27:43.080]  also going to be a lot of people out there who are looking for reasons why
[2:27:43.080 --> 2:27:45.720]  they don't need to care about the Apple Watch. They're looking for an excuse
[2:27:45.720 --> 2:27:50.160]  not to buy it. They're looking for a reason to rule it out in their head as
[2:27:50.160 --> 2:27:56.160]  irrelevant fail move on. And so any ammo that is provided to that is going to
[2:27:56.160 --> 2:28:00.480]  be amplified like crazy. And you know, they have to be very careful not to give
[2:28:00.480 --> 2:28:03.360]  much ammo to that. You know, there's going to be some kind of gate with everything
[2:28:03.360 --> 2:28:06.880]  Apple launches now. Every stupid gate that comes out every time there's a new
[2:28:06.880 --> 2:28:11.320]  iPhone. Like there's going to be some kind of watch gate. And they have to
[2:28:11.320 --> 2:28:16.200]  make sure that it's something that's you know, reasonably stupid, like
[2:28:16.200 --> 2:28:20.320]  bend gate and not something serious. All right. Well, you know, yeah, imagine if
[2:28:20.320 --> 2:28:24.360]  it's a real thing. Like if Ben Gate got as much publicity as it did and it was
[2:28:24.360 --> 2:28:29.960]  mostly nonsense. And then Ten of Gate got the enormous publicity it got and
[2:28:29.960 --> 2:28:37.520]  was in the long run mostly nonsense. Imagine a real problem. You know, like
[2:28:37.520 --> 2:28:42.320]  you know, you're supposed to be able to hold the button and dictate your, you
[2:28:42.320 --> 2:28:46.920]  know, texts to your watch. And instead you just get a spinner that spins and
[2:28:46.920 --> 2:28:51.360]  spins and spins and you never get your text. That's a problem. Right, exactly. And so
[2:28:51.360 --> 2:28:55.960]  like these quality things are extremely, you know, this is like like when I've
[2:28:55.960 --> 2:28:59.440]  been critical of their developer policies recently, one of the things I've
[2:28:59.440 --> 2:29:03.680]  said is like, this is strategically a very bad time to have problems in this
[2:29:03.680 --> 2:29:08.080]  area because the watch is coming out. And when the watch is coming out, you
[2:29:08.080 --> 2:29:12.200]  need the quality of everything that's that's powering it on the phone side.
[2:29:12.200 --> 2:29:14.800]  You know, everything that's supplying it with the data, the
[2:29:14.800 --> 2:29:18.480]  Bluetooth stuff. You said like, you the quality of that to be tip-top. So that
[2:29:18.480 --> 2:29:21.720]  way the watch can at least focus on it's own, like, you know, those teams can
[2:29:21.720 --> 2:29:25.680]  rely on that. And then the watch can have the solid foundation under it. And you
[2:29:25.680 --> 2:29:32.240]  also need developers who are empowered and willing and happy to be developing
[2:29:32.240 --> 2:29:35.160]  apps for this platform and that that are going to push the boundaries and make
[2:29:35.160 --> 2:29:40.280]  cool apps for it. So two things that Mark German reported, I think I'm the
[2:29:40.280 --> 2:29:44.720]  same day this week, but he reported first about that this, you know, showing
[2:29:44.720 --> 2:29:49.840]  mockups of a 12 inch MacBook Air, but he also said the date that Apple's
[2:29:49.840 --> 2:29:53.960]  planning for a March release date of Apple Watch. Did that, that surprised me a
[2:29:53.960 --> 2:29:58.200]  little if it's true. That sounded late to me. I because really, I thought that
[2:29:58.200 --> 2:30:03.920]  sounded early. I really expected like April or May. Maybe I don't know. You
[2:30:03.920 --> 2:30:06.200]  know, we I think we heard rumblings a couple of weeks ago that it would be
[2:30:06.200 --> 2:30:09.840]  like February, but it doesn't really matter. I mean, you know, it'll come out
[2:30:09.840 --> 2:30:13.480]  when it's out. I would rather have it come out when it's when it's better
[2:30:13.480 --> 2:30:17.960]  than come out when it's not quite ready. So that's fine. It doesn't really
[2:30:17.960 --> 2:30:22.200]  matter. Yeah, you know, I, I guess it's just the pessimist to me. They say
[2:30:22.200 --> 2:30:29.280]  early 2015 I hear before June. Yeah, you, you hear May 31st. Right. Whereas I
[2:30:29.280 --> 2:30:33.240]  guess the more honest way of looking at it is early is first quarter. I don't
[2:30:33.240 --> 2:30:38.120]  know. So maybe it will. I'm a little surprised by that. It also makes me wonder
[2:30:38.120 --> 2:30:44.280]  whether I should be on my feet for an Apple event, you know, sooner rather than
[2:30:44.280 --> 2:30:51.000]  later. I mean, I think an Apple event is fair game anytime. I mean, I wouldn't
[2:30:51.000 --> 2:30:54.560]  expect it like next week, but I would, you know, if it, if there was an event in
[2:30:54.560 --> 2:30:58.400]  February with availability of a couple of weeks later, that wouldn't surprise
[2:30:58.400 --> 2:31:04.200]  me. Yeah, I mean, neither. So german's other stories is blockbuster 12 inch MacBook
[2:31:04.200 --> 2:31:12.200]  Air. Yeah, with one port with one port, which is so crazy that I think it's
[2:31:12.200 --> 2:31:15.200]  probably true. Yeah, well, too, it was the headphone, but that doesn't really
[2:31:15.200 --> 2:31:21.280]  count. Right. And I, it's, I thought Snell's reaction was perfect for he was
[2:31:21.280 --> 2:31:27.000]  just like that. That's correct. Well, yeah, okay. Yeah, exactly. It's like, if you
[2:31:27.000 --> 2:31:29.880]  would have, if we would have, I don't remember if the first MacBook Air had
[2:31:29.880 --> 2:31:34.040]  any rumors leads, I don't think it did. No, it was, it was a total surprise. Yeah,
[2:31:34.040 --> 2:31:37.800]  as I recall, I recall it being like a holy shit, I cannot believe that. Right,
[2:31:37.800 --> 2:31:41.040]  exactly. I think you're right. So anyway. And I think the slogan, I think it was
[2:31:41.040 --> 2:31:44.640]  a, I think it was at WWDC. I just remember there's something that said, there's
[2:31:44.640 --> 2:31:50.000]  something in the air. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so like, I like, if we would have heard
[2:31:50.000 --> 2:31:54.440]  rumors about that beforehand, and we would have heard crazy things like, because
[2:31:54.440 --> 2:31:58.080]  that was also, was that the first one that didn't have an optical drive? Yeah,
[2:31:58.080 --> 2:32:01.240]  I think it was. Yeah, because they launched the external one with it. Yeah,
[2:32:01.240 --> 2:32:04.800]  because everybody among the many, how can they do this is impossible? It's like,
[2:32:04.800 --> 2:32:08.000]  how can they ship a thing with how you can install the OS? Right. So it's, so
[2:32:08.000 --> 2:32:12.800]  you know, they shipped this 3.0 pound, right, laptop at the time when
[2:32:12.800 --> 2:32:17.400]  everything else was 5.5 pounds. They shipped this 3.0 pound laptop that fit in
[2:32:17.440 --> 2:32:22.240]  a mailing envelope and was super thin and had this like sharp edge in the
[2:32:22.240 --> 2:32:29.280]  front and had no optical drive. And sometimes no hard drive. One USB port. Like,
[2:32:29.280 --> 2:32:33.920]  it was, it was so, it, it was so much smaller. They had to make a separate
[2:32:33.920 --> 2:32:37.840]  power adapter for it. Even the power adapter was smaller. Even the plug on the
[2:32:37.840 --> 2:32:41.800]  end of it was different shape to fit the beveled edge. You had this door that the
[2:32:41.800 --> 2:32:45.520]  ports folded out from this door. I mean, they were so much about it that if you
[2:32:45.520 --> 2:32:48.600]  would have heard of ahead of time, and even when it did come out, everyone was
[2:32:48.600 --> 2:32:54.200]  like, that's crazy. It was January 2008. There was a Mac World Expo. There you
[2:32:54.200 --> 2:32:57.600]  go. So it was the year to the year after the year after the iPhone
[2:32:57.600 --> 2:33:01.120]  introduction at Mac World, it was, it was a big, another big introduction at
[2:33:01.120 --> 2:33:03.920]  Mac World. Yeah, I'll have to go back and rewatch that and try to like,
[2:33:03.920 --> 2:33:07.560]  gaze the reaction. Cause like, and I actually, I had one of those. David at
[2:33:07.560 --> 2:33:10.960]  Tumblr got me one of those as a bonus. Cause I, I had mentioned how I wanted a
[2:33:10.960 --> 2:33:14.480]  lighter laptop. And it was very nice. And I have one of those. And it was
[2:33:14.960 --> 2:33:18.400]  ungodly slow. I mean, cause I, you know, I had the hard drive model. So it was
[2:33:18.400 --> 2:33:22.600]  like, it was, uh, you know, there's one point eight inch iPod hard drive in
[2:33:22.600 --> 2:33:30.360]  there. The SSD option was $1,000 more and 64 gigs. Or you can get the, the iPod
[2:33:30.360 --> 2:33:33.440]  hard drive, which was 80 gigs, which is what I got. I remember simply got,
[2:33:33.440 --> 2:33:37.160]  simply got the SSD version. And it was like, I know it sounds crazy, but it's a
[2:33:37.160 --> 2:33:41.400]  great development machine because SSDs are so great for development because
[2:33:41.400 --> 2:33:45.320]  you're dealing with, you know, hundreds of tiny little files. Yeah. And in 2008,
[2:33:45.320 --> 2:33:49.520]  when this thing came out, that like SSDs were extremely rare that it was one of
[2:33:49.520 --> 2:33:53.400]  the first computers to even offer it as an option. Uh, I don't think it was the
[2:33:53.400 --> 2:33:58.280]  first, but it was one of the first. And, and so like that machine, when it
[2:33:58.280 --> 2:34:03.560]  came out had all these crazy limitations and a lot of flaws, I mean, like, like
[2:34:03.560 --> 2:34:06.760]  the CPU, we talked about a little bit of a CPU, like the CPU on a lot of them
[2:34:06.760 --> 2:34:10.600]  would, would overheat and throttle. So like, you couldn't watch YouTube videos.
[2:34:10.600 --> 2:34:14.000]  Like you, you, you, you couldn't play a flash video for more than a few
[2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:16.720]  seconds before it started dropping frames because the CPU was ever heating
[2:34:16.720 --> 2:34:20.200]  and throttling. I actually, on my, I ran an underclocking utility that
[2:34:20.200 --> 2:34:24.040]  would, underclock and undervolt the chip to keep it running cooler. So that
[2:34:24.040 --> 2:34:28.480]  way it could sustain its, its peak usage for, for enough time to, to play
[2:34:28.480 --> 2:34:34.200]  videos smooth, but like it was, it was a crazy machine. It was way ahead of
[2:34:34.200 --> 2:34:37.960]  its time. And in many ways, that was a bad thing. I made it, you know, that
[2:34:37.960 --> 2:34:43.880]  the performance was just dismal. Um, it was extremely inconvenient to move
[2:34:43.880 --> 2:34:49.160]  files to it because it only had, uh, it had 8 to 11 G or I think it was the
[2:34:49.160 --> 2:34:53.320]  draft N wireless. So like, you know, wireless was still a lot slower back
[2:34:53.320 --> 2:34:58.600]  then. And it only had a single USB 2.0 port, no fire wire, no
[2:34:58.600 --> 2:35:03.800]  thunderbolt, uh, USB 2. And you, you could like, you could send files to it over
[2:35:03.800 --> 2:35:07.240]  wireless, which would take forever, or you could get the wired ether adapter,
[2:35:07.240 --> 2:35:12.880]  the USB one, that was only 10, 100 and ran over USB 2. And USB 2 is a horrible
[2:35:12.880 --> 2:35:17.400]  protocol. And, and so like transferring files to it would just take hours. It
[2:35:17.400 --> 2:35:19.720]  like, if you wanted to like put a bunch of like moves on to it, when you go on
[2:35:19.720 --> 2:35:24.520]  a big trip or something, it would just take hours. It was unbearable to use
[2:35:24.520 --> 2:35:30.360]  in many contexts, but what was so new about it being so incredibly thin and
[2:35:30.360 --> 2:35:34.440]  light, mostly light. The thinness was kind of a nice bonus, but it was mostly
[2:35:34.440 --> 2:35:39.640]  the weight being so radically much smaller than everything else. That was so
[2:35:39.640 --> 2:35:44.520]  good that this machine was quite compelling for a lot of people. It, it was
[2:35:44.520 --> 2:35:48.680]  not good enough to be your only computer for most people. And some people
[2:35:48.680 --> 2:35:51.560]  put it off, but it, for the most part, it wasn't gonna be your only one.
[2:35:51.560 --> 2:35:56.120]  Right, because it only had 64 gigs of storage or 80 if you had the
[2:35:56.120 --> 2:36:01.160]  the beautifully slow one. Right. So, you know, at a time when you had a lot less
[2:36:01.160 --> 2:36:05.960]  cloud storage. Yeah. Yeah, like you had to keep a lot more. You had to keep
[2:36:05.960 --> 2:36:09.320]  everything you had locally. Like there was there was no such thing as like,
[2:36:09.320 --> 2:36:12.280]  oh, I'm gonna keep everything I have on Dropbox. I only think this one little
[2:36:12.280 --> 2:36:15.480]  folder over or I'm gonna keep everything on, you know, I don't think iTunes
[2:36:15.480 --> 2:36:22.280]  match was out. Yeah, like there it was it was a much worse time to have very limited
[2:36:22.280 --> 2:36:26.120]  storage. And so, but, but, you know, people made it work and it wasn't, it
[2:36:26.120 --> 2:36:30.200]  wasn't overall a great machine, but it was really compelling in a few
[2:36:30.200 --> 2:36:34.760]  key areas. So now bringing it forward and, you know, in 2010, they made the
[2:36:34.760 --> 2:36:38.680]  better Macbook airs and SSD started getting bigger and cheaper and they went
[2:36:38.680 --> 2:36:43.560]  all SSD and then the 2010 and forward Macbook airs are far better machines.
[2:36:43.560 --> 2:36:50.200]  But, and and now like they pointed out on, I don't even think it's, I don't
[2:36:50.200 --> 2:36:54.600]  think there's any argument that for most people who it's the most popular
[2:36:54.600 --> 2:36:58.600]  Mac Apple sells and for most people it's their only Mac. Yeah, I mean, you know,
[2:36:58.600 --> 2:37:02.120]  if you, if someone comes to me and says, what Mac should I buy and they,
[2:37:02.120 --> 2:37:05.800]  and they don't give me any other information. If, if they, if I need to have a
[2:37:05.800 --> 2:37:09.800]  no questions asked answer to that, the answer is a 13 inch Macbook
[2:37:09.800 --> 2:37:13.480]  air. Yeah. Like, that's it. That's the answer. That's the thing. I interrupted you. You
[2:37:13.480 --> 2:37:16.840]  said something about the connected. Yeah. So they mentioned this on this week.
[2:37:16.840 --> 2:37:21.480]  They were saying pointing out how like, you know, the MacBook Air used to be
[2:37:22.280 --> 2:37:28.360]  this high end. It started out. It was $1,800 or $1,600. It was priced
[2:37:28.360 --> 2:37:34.120]  above the other, above the 13 inch MacBook. Yep. And it was a premium product
[2:37:34.120 --> 2:37:39.160]  to be slower and smaller and everything. But it was so much more portable.
[2:37:39.160 --> 2:37:43.400]  It was like getting a little convertible coupe. Exactly. Perfect. Perfect
[2:37:43.400 --> 2:37:48.600]  analogy. And so, yeah, it probably shouldn't be your family sedan. But, but, but,
[2:37:48.600 --> 2:37:52.760]  you know, it is a fun, like little, you know, little portable. And, and so, like,
[2:37:53.480 --> 2:37:57.640]  the original MacBook Air was this premium thing that's had above the rest of the line,
[2:37:58.920 --> 2:38:02.840]  relative to its size. Yeah. Imagine for like business travelers who, you know, do a lot of
[2:38:02.840 --> 2:38:08.040]  typing on, you know, coach seats on their plane. It was, you know, I hate to say it. It's such a
[2:38:08.040 --> 2:38:12.200]  cliche. It was a game changer. Yeah. I mean, and, and for those, for those that got the SSD,
[2:38:12.200 --> 2:38:18.680]  I think it was like $3,400. It was some, some crazy amount of money. But, uh, but, you know, so,
[2:38:18.680 --> 2:38:23.880]  so it was this, this premium, awesome sports coupe kind of thing. Since then, as they pointed out
[2:38:23.880 --> 2:38:29.080]  on, unconnected, it has actually become the bottom of the line. Like, it, it has filtered down. Now,
[2:38:29.080 --> 2:38:33.560]  like, there is no regular MacBook anymore, or there's that, there's that one model left over
[2:38:33.560 --> 2:38:37.160]  that, that they bury on the site. But for the most part, like, the bottom of the, of the
[2:38:37.160 --> 2:38:43.880]  Mac line is the MacBook Air. And so this, if you think about this crazy new one port rumor that,
[2:38:43.880 --> 2:38:49.400]  that German had with a 12-inch being this, like, crazy new premium thing, if you think about that,
[2:38:49.400 --> 2:38:55.480]  not as a replacement to the 11-inch MacBook Air, that exists today. But if you think about it,
[2:38:55.480 --> 2:38:59.400]  in more of the style that the original was relative to its siblings in the lineup,
[2:38:59.400 --> 2:39:07.320]  this kind of mid-range, or like this mid-price thing, probably, you know, $1,500 range type thing,
[2:39:07.320 --> 2:39:11.160]  or maybe a little bit more, we'll see, see how, how it specs out. But, you know,
[2:39:11.160 --> 2:39:15.320]  think about it as like a, not the low end of the lineup, but a mid-range of the lineup that in
[2:39:15.320 --> 2:39:21.000]  some ways is more limited and worse than the MacBook Airs that we know today, possibly by,
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:26.200]  by having this one port, or by, if it uses any of these, uh, new Intel Broadwell core
[2:39:26.200 --> 2:39:31.640]  analogs, it'll be a lot slower, it'll be roughly iPad speed, which is not slow by, you know,
[2:39:31.640 --> 2:39:36.440]  absolute terms for the most part, but relative to the other CPU that's, you know, it's not going
[2:39:36.440 --> 2:39:43.640]  to be in the same class. It's, it's always a moment when a next-generation machine has slower
[2:39:43.640 --> 2:39:48.360]  than what came this before. Exactly. And there might be good reasons for it, but it still is not
[2:39:48.360 --> 2:39:52.520]  the way the industry works. Right. And the first MacBook Air was a, was a big example of that,
[2:39:52.520 --> 2:39:56.680]  and that, and it got trashed initially. I remember when Macworld first reviewed it, I think it
[2:39:56.680 --> 2:40:00.200]  was Jason overroaded, when they first reviewed it, they were like, this is like the slowest Mac,
[2:40:00.200 --> 2:40:04.440]  we've tested it in, in a while. It was, it was the slowest one in the whole lineup at the time,
[2:40:04.440 --> 2:40:10.360]  and, uh, but anyway, if we think about it in that context as maybe it's something like that,
[2:40:11.720 --> 2:40:15.720]  I think it, it, that leaves room for it to suck in a few ways, that leaves room for it to be
[2:40:15.720 --> 2:40:21.960]  limited in a few ways, for it to say, this is going to be a, a niche premium thing that's going to
[2:40:21.960 --> 2:40:28.360]  extremely prioritize certain physical factors in exchange for, you know, extreme,
[2:40:28.360 --> 2:40:32.120]  something, extreme portability, maybe extreme battery life, probably not. I'm, I'm the
[2:40:32.120 --> 2:40:36.040]  actually guessing the battery life is going to be mediocre on it. Um, but, you know, it's going to
[2:40:36.040 --> 2:40:42.920]  prioritize thinness and lightness and size, it seems, if it, exactly above all else, including battery
[2:40:42.920 --> 2:40:47.480]  life, it's going to make your existing MacBook Air feel thick and heavy. Exactly. The same way,
[2:40:47.480 --> 2:40:53.480]  the original MacBook Air made even the 13 inch MacBook feel just like a, like a brick, like,
[2:40:53.480 --> 2:40:59.960]  you know, it, if they can pull that off, it's going to be really interesting. I, I do have a
[2:40:59.960 --> 2:41:07.080]  slight concern in this area that I, I do think, you know, the, the, you certainly have to some
[2:41:07.080 --> 2:41:11.560]  degree you have diminishing returns here. Uh, when, when the original MacBook Air came out,
[2:41:11.560 --> 2:41:17.880]  it was like half the weight, or close to it of, of the 13 inch MacBook at the time. Uh,
[2:41:19.080 --> 2:41:25.640]  how, how much lighter can it get while still having a keyboard, a screen, a battery of some kind,
[2:41:25.640 --> 2:41:30.760]  a aluminum case around the whole thing, like, I don't think they're going to be able to nail
[2:41:30.760 --> 2:41:35.480]  half the weight. Like, I don't think it probably can't go that low. And we're already talking,
[2:41:35.480 --> 2:41:40.760]  these are already very thin, like computers as they are today. So to make it even thinner, even lighter,
[2:41:40.760 --> 2:41:45.320]  for something that is not handheld, like, it matters more in an iPad or an iPhone because you're,
[2:41:45.320 --> 2:41:48.920]  it's handheld. For something that's on a desk or a lot most of the time or a tray table,
[2:41:49.800 --> 2:41:56.280]  the weight is, you know, it matters to a point, but like, if the, if the computer goes from,
[2:41:56.280 --> 2:42:00.440]  I mean, what the current 11 is, well, like, 2.2, 2.5, something like that pounds.
[2:42:00.440 --> 2:42:04.360]  Yeah, I'm bad at remembering what they are. It's something like that. Like, I know what, I know what
[2:42:04.360 --> 2:42:09.880]  it feels like. I don't know what the number is. Right. But like, if it goes from 2.5 pounds to
[2:42:09.880 --> 2:42:15.400]  1.8 pounds, or if it goes from 2.2 to 1.5, like, that's a big difference on paper. It's a big
[2:42:15.400 --> 2:42:22.040]  percentage difference, but it, like, your whole bag weighs like 15 pounds, even like a backpack
[2:42:22.040 --> 2:42:27.480]  empty weighs more than that usually. And so like, you know, you might not even notice the weight
[2:42:27.480 --> 2:42:35.560]  difference. So I do worry, they might be prioritizing, thinness and, and extreme lightness,
[2:42:35.560 --> 2:42:43.160]  a little bit too much in this case. If it, me, if it will come at the expense of battery life,
[2:42:43.160 --> 2:42:47.800]  because I think this is the kind of machine that the battery life on the current MacBook Air is
[2:42:48.760 --> 2:42:55.320]  good. It's not, it doesn't, it isn't to use a term that used to be a verb and is now an
[2:42:55.320 --> 2:43:01.880]  adjective, thanks to Apple. It isn't blow away, but it's good. They're good. Like, you know,
[2:43:01.880 --> 2:43:04.760]  when they came out, they were impressive, but, you know, time was moved on. That's now,
[2:43:04.760 --> 2:43:09.720]  that's not a baseline. Yeah, all, all modern MacBooks have amazing battery life compared to the
[2:43:09.720 --> 2:43:15.240]  old days where it was stuck at like three to four hours. Exactly. The fact of battery life,
[2:43:15.240 --> 2:43:19.960]  no matter what, no matter which one you bought, no matter what you did, you know, turn the screen
[2:43:19.960 --> 2:43:25.480]  dimness down. Right. You know, three to four hours is about what you could get. And it would lose
[2:43:25.480 --> 2:43:32.120]  about an hour per year of age too. Yeah, pretty quickly. I just, as any, as a coaster, I just always
[2:43:32.120 --> 2:43:36.840]  knew you could never really go coast to coast, even with a new ride. Right. Exactly. You know,
[2:43:36.840 --> 2:43:40.680]  you kind of, you know, if you're going to work on an airplane while you flew to San Francisco from
[2:43:40.680 --> 2:43:45.160]  the east coast, get your work done because you're not going to, you know, it's going to die with an
[2:43:45.160 --> 2:43:50.200]  hour to go. Exactly. And, and like today, if you're using a laptop, if you're doing like, you know,
[2:43:50.200 --> 2:43:57.640]  medium, medium lifting on it throughout the day, it can almost, but generally not run all day on
[2:43:57.640 --> 2:44:02.360]  battery. Like, they say like, you know, oh, you have all day battery life, well, it depends on what
[2:44:02.360 --> 2:44:05.800]  you're doing with it. Yeah. And if, and if you leave your house with the solid charge,
[2:44:05.800 --> 2:44:11.400]  you can watch movies on the whole flight, no problem. Right. But, you know, the question is like,
[2:44:11.400 --> 2:44:17.240]  you know, if you have, you know, a 40 minute layover somewhere, do you have to plug it in?
[2:44:17.240 --> 2:44:21.080]  Or is it just kind of optional whether you plug it in? You know, that kind of thing. Anyway,
[2:44:21.080 --> 2:44:27.560]  so I think they, if they're using this, this super low power, you know, a fanless, broad well
[2:44:27.560 --> 2:44:31.560]  chip that uses, I forget what the wattage is on it, but it's very low like 10 watts or something like that.
[2:44:33.160 --> 2:44:39.400]  They could, if they put in a similar size battery to the current MacBook Airs, that could be a
[2:44:39.400 --> 2:44:46.760]  very substantial battery life. But they might instead choose to just keep, keep roughly, you know,
[2:44:46.760 --> 2:44:51.080]  what's 11 inch today, like roughly like five hour life, something like that, and in real use.
[2:44:51.080 --> 2:44:54.760]  Oh, I would say more than that. I think so. I don't know. Whatever it is.
[2:44:54.760 --> 2:44:59.720]  Mine's old, so it's hard to say, but it's pretty, pretty good. Whatever it like, the 11 is worse
[2:44:59.720 --> 2:45:05.320]  than 13 by, by a pretty good margin, because 13 has a much bigger battery. But, um, it wouldn't
[2:45:05.320 --> 2:45:09.720]  surprise me at all, given what they've done with iOS devices, with the, with the, with the iPhone
[2:45:09.720 --> 2:45:16.680]  6 and with the iPad Air 2 and Air 1. I wonder how much if, again, there's a huge if, but if
[2:45:16.680 --> 2:45:23.560]  it's true that it really only has this one port, I wonder how much that is about cost and how
[2:45:23.560 --> 2:45:28.520]  much it is about using whatever space is left for battery, you know, that it's not so much that
[2:45:28.520 --> 2:45:35.880]  it would cost too much to add a second USB port, but that it's really, really, really intensive
[2:45:35.880 --> 2:45:41.240]  to save space. I would guess it's about two things, neither of which are very good answers.
[2:45:41.240 --> 2:45:47.800]  I would guess it's about symmetry, having one port on each side, and about thinness, that if
[2:45:47.800 --> 2:45:53.720]  German's scoop is correct, then it still retains the wedge to your drop shape. So it still is
[2:45:53.720 --> 2:45:59.480]  thicker at the back than it is at the front. And, and if his thickness claims are accurate,
[2:45:59.480 --> 2:46:04.840]  then there actually is not much room for more than the port that it has thickness wise.
[2:46:04.840 --> 2:46:09.960]  Right. And also I would not, I would not discount the value of symmetry. I think symmetry is the
[2:46:09.960 --> 2:46:15.800]  reason why on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, why the sleep wake button is directly across from the volume
[2:46:15.800 --> 2:46:20.840]  up button, even though it makes it way harder to hit just one of them. Right. And it's the same size.
[2:46:21.480 --> 2:46:26.920]  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So I would definitely not discount that as as a possible reason why it would
[2:46:26.920 --> 2:46:33.320]  only be one port. Also, just, you know, electrically, like if a computer has a USB port and a firewire
[2:46:33.320 --> 2:46:39.400]  port, those specs each demand the port be able to supply at least X amps of current through it,
[2:46:39.400 --> 2:46:45.320]  you know, at at most to supply a device of power. So the more ports it has on it, the higher the
[2:46:45.320 --> 2:46:51.560]  total power output for that computer has to be able to to have capacity for somebody on Twitter pointed
[2:46:51.560 --> 2:46:57.960]  on. I'm so sorry I forgot your name, but that if it had even just two USB ports and they were
[2:46:57.960 --> 2:47:02.920]  both USB C and it might have to be USB C because I think I think the device is too thin to have
[2:47:02.920 --> 2:47:09.640]  a traditional USB port. Yeah, I think you're right. I think the the minimal size of a USB 3 port is thick
[2:47:09.640 --> 2:47:14.440]  enough that it would be a gating factor to make the overall device this thin. So it has to be the
[2:47:14.440 --> 2:47:21.240]  new USB. But if it had two and you can and they're going to use it for supplying power to the
[2:47:21.240 --> 2:47:27.640]  machine, you couldn't risk having two power adapters plugged in at the same time that I don't know
[2:47:27.640 --> 2:47:32.680]  if that's true or not that it would, you know, like break the machine or something. And conversely,
[2:47:32.680 --> 2:47:39.320]  how do you tell people you can use this one for right? And this one, which is the same port,
[2:47:39.320 --> 2:47:43.960]  it's exactly the same size. It can take every every other thing you can plug any other one,
[2:47:43.960 --> 2:47:47.720]  but that one won't take a charger. Right. And in the PC world, they would just color one of them
[2:47:47.720 --> 2:47:51.480]  like blue or something and say, well, just plug in the blue one, but they, you know, Apple won't
[2:47:51.480 --> 2:47:55.320]  do anything like that. Right. And it would just lead to confusion because maybe you're running on
[2:47:55.320 --> 2:47:58.840]  battery power and you've got a mouse plugged in one and a hard drive in the other. But now you
[2:47:58.840 --> 2:48:04.200]  need power. So you think, well, I'll unplug the mouse. Oh, but I plugged the mouse and the other one
[2:48:04.200 --> 2:48:08.600]  and the hard drive, which I can't unmount because I'm still copying files to it is in the power one.
[2:48:08.600 --> 2:48:12.440]  It doesn't, it just doesn't, you know, yeah, that's the kind of elegant solution Apple is very
[2:48:12.440 --> 2:48:17.400]  unlikely to do. It actually makes some sense that if you're going to use USB for power and you
[2:48:17.400 --> 2:48:23.240]  can only have power plugged into one port, therefore you can only have one port. Exactly. So yeah,
[2:48:23.240 --> 2:48:30.680]  I would expect, I'm guessing, like the more I think about it, the one port thing actually
[2:48:30.680 --> 2:48:37.640]  sounds plausible and the more I learn about USB 3C. These new seaports are extremely versatile
[2:48:37.640 --> 2:48:42.840]  and I don't know the extreme details yet, but they, like they design the specs that the
[2:48:42.840 --> 2:48:49.240]  port can carry power seemingly in either direction, like that you could have a computer that
[2:48:49.240 --> 2:48:54.520]  powers the monitor and drives a display. So you can also route display signals over it and you can
[2:48:54.520 --> 2:48:59.320]  route high bandwidth buses over it and everything. It's, it's crazy how much this thing can do them.
[2:48:59.320 --> 2:49:05.320]  We'll see how it works out in practice, but like it's, it's designed such that you could have
[2:49:05.320 --> 2:49:10.920]  just this one cable running from a monitor into a PC and have the PC both power the monitor
[2:49:10.920 --> 2:49:16.040]  and show the display signal over this one little cable. Yeah. And it's crazy. You know, and in terms
[2:49:16.040 --> 2:49:21.560]  of like skating to where the puck is going, which is what the MacBook Air was at its beginning.
[2:49:21.560 --> 2:49:28.040]  So the original MacBook has said no optical drives. And now this one says no more SD cards
[2:49:28.040 --> 2:49:35.640]  port and no USB port extra USB port where you could plug one in. Well, guess what? I think SD cards
[2:49:35.640 --> 2:49:41.640]  are going the way the dodo and that your photos are going to travel over the air between devices.
[2:49:41.640 --> 2:49:46.440]  Right. And of course we're not there yet. And if you're the more serious a photographer you are,
[2:49:46.440 --> 2:49:51.640]  you know, the less doable that is, but more and more regular people are shooting all of their
[2:49:51.640 --> 2:49:57.240]  photos with their phones and iPads. And they're, you know, in the Apple universe, we'll therefore be
[2:49:57.240 --> 2:50:03.160]  using iCloud photos sync. And that's how your photos will get to your Mac. And a lot of consumer
[2:50:03.160 --> 2:50:12.680]  cameras have Wi-Fi now. And you can transfer photos that way. Right. So I think, I think you're
[2:50:12.680 --> 2:50:18.280]  right. This, this computer, you know, again, if this is real, which I, it seems increasingly plausible.
[2:50:19.000 --> 2:50:24.040]  If this was real, I think this, this is a forward looking computer aggressively. So just like
[2:50:24.040 --> 2:50:31.240]  the first air, as you said, they couldn't go, you know, basically portless. They couldn't go portless
[2:50:31.240 --> 2:50:37.400]  on the whole lineup yet. But they can have one weird outlier that is really good in some other way,
[2:50:37.400 --> 2:50:42.520]  most likely thinness and weight. They couldn't have this one crazy outlier that is awesome at this,
[2:50:42.520 --> 2:50:46.360]  at this, like one aspect of itself and gives up a lot to get there.
[2:50:47.720 --> 2:50:54.840]  I think it's true too. And let's, you know, german's report and I believe it. I mean, it could be
[2:50:54.840 --> 2:51:00.040]  details are off, but I mostly believe it, but he seems very sure about it. And I think he attributed
[2:51:00.040 --> 2:51:04.040]  the source to someone with an apple who's used one, or at least, you know, like use the current
[2:51:04.040 --> 2:51:08.760]  prototype. Yeah. And then the source told him everything about it. And then he gave that to an
[2:51:08.760 --> 2:51:17.080]  artist who made those renderings. So, you know, there's some pass it down the alleyway, you know,
[2:51:17.080 --> 2:51:21.640]  stuff that was probably not quite right in terms of, you know, the degree of tapering or some
[2:51:21.640 --> 2:51:26.920]  stuff like that. But it wasn't german who said anything about what chip is in it, you know,
[2:51:26.920 --> 2:51:31.480]  whether it's this new M chip or anything like that. German's report was just what that thing looks
[2:51:31.480 --> 2:51:37.080]  like. Right. And we don't like Intel did just release a broadwell series chip that is
[2:51:37.080 --> 2:51:40.920]  fanless or that kind of run fanless that it just uses, it uses so little power that camera
[2:51:40.920 --> 2:51:46.360]  and family did german say that it's fanless? No. I see it. I think everyone's guessing that it is
[2:51:46.360 --> 2:51:52.200]  probably fanless. I don't think he actually said it is. And, you know, the way CPU cooling works,
[2:51:52.200 --> 2:51:58.680]  you can like, you know, all the current MacBooks have fans. Most of the time, most people won't hear
[2:51:58.680 --> 2:52:03.720]  them, especially the newer ones are even better. They're even quieter, but the retina series.
[2:52:03.720 --> 2:52:09.720]  But you can, like, you can have something that's totally fanless like an iPad and have it
[2:52:09.720 --> 2:52:14.840]  have it basically just use the chassis as a giant heat sink. And, you know, just basically
[2:52:15.560 --> 2:52:20.920]  radiate here, you know, through contacts, like radiate heat into the exterior shell or some interior
[2:52:20.920 --> 2:52:26.200]  thing that, you know, I'm talking to the shell eventually. If you have a little heat sink and you
[2:52:26.200 --> 2:52:33.480]  have any air moving at all, even even if you have the slowest, quietest fan that most people don't
[2:52:33.480 --> 2:52:36.840]  even realize is there, like the original Apple TV had a fan, if you don't even know that,
[2:52:37.800 --> 2:52:43.080]  even if you have the the tiniest little fan in there blowing the slowest speed it can
[2:52:43.080 --> 2:52:49.720]  and can possibly go barely moving any air over it, that cools way better than any kind of passive
[2:52:49.720 --> 2:52:55.000]  cooling. Like, the slightest bit of air movement is substantially better. And you can, you can
[2:52:55.000 --> 2:53:00.120]  dissipate a lot more heat that way. So, it reminds her of the world's tiniest violin playing
[2:53:00.120 --> 2:53:05.880]  the world's smallest song. The world's tiniest fan blowing the world's smallest amount of air.
[2:53:05.880 --> 2:53:09.560]  Yeah, like, it makes a huge difference. And, and that gives you a much higher thermal budget.
[2:53:09.560 --> 2:53:14.520]  And modern processors are pretty much all limited by their thermal budgets, like their,
[2:53:14.520 --> 2:53:20.040]  their performance is gated by that factor. So, they don't have to use a fanless chip in this.
[2:53:20.040 --> 2:53:25.480]  If they, if they don't want to, they still could. If they wanted to, I think they can fit a fan
[2:53:25.480 --> 2:53:31.240]  in there. I think they like, well, if the surface has, the surface has a fan, the surface pro does
[2:53:31.240 --> 2:53:38.040]  at least. Yeah, it's really thin, right? Well, it's certainly thinner than, I think it's just,
[2:53:38.040 --> 2:53:42.760]  I'm not quite as sure if it's as thin as this MacBook is because the surface thinness doesn't
[2:53:42.760 --> 2:53:46.520]  have, it doesn't have a hinge. Right. Although, I think it has ports somewhere. So,
[2:53:46.520 --> 2:53:51.000]  it probably isn't this thin, but it's probably in the ballpark. And so, yeah, like, I think
[2:53:51.000 --> 2:53:56.600]  they could put a fan in there if they want to. They could be using ACPU that has, that is like
[2:53:57.240 --> 2:54:01.880]  the same in class as the existing MacBook Air CPUs of like that, that classic performance.
[2:54:01.880 --> 2:54:06.840]  All right. So, german's report does say above the keyboard are four redesigned speaker grills that
[2:54:06.840 --> 2:54:12.200]  actually double as ventilation holes for the fanless device to keep cool. So, german says it
[2:54:12.200 --> 2:54:21.640]  fanless, but we shall see. I think you're right. I'm with you. And I think that these
[2:54:21.640 --> 2:54:29.480]  verge guys are just misreading the whole thing when they, they're saying that it's like a low-end
[2:54:29.480 --> 2:54:35.240]  device that will compete with Chromebooks. Not a chance. I think it's going to be more expensive.
[2:54:35.240 --> 2:54:39.960]  And I think, therefore, just like when they introduced the retina MacBook Pros and they kept
[2:54:39.960 --> 2:54:46.760]  non-retna ones around to anchor the low-end of the pricing tier. I mean, you could still buy
[2:54:46.760 --> 2:54:51.080]  non-retna MacBook Pros. You know, I think they started, I think they're only like 10,
[2:54:51.080 --> 2:54:54.920]  like a thousand bucks. I think you can get like a 13-inch. Yeah, I think there's one. That's
[2:54:54.920 --> 2:54:58.360]  what it's like. There's like one buried in the store that's like an 1100 bucks. They mentioned that
[2:54:58.360 --> 2:55:02.920]  I connected also. Yeah. So, I think this will be more expensive than the current starting price for
[2:55:02.920 --> 2:55:07.720]  even the 13-inch MacBook Pro. And I don't think it would be much more. I think it probably
[2:55:07.720 --> 2:55:15.960]  start at like, I don't know, 1300 bucks, 1400 bucks, maybe. And that they'll keep, I don't know if
[2:55:15.960 --> 2:55:22.840]  they'll keep both the 11 and 13, but they'll keep at least the 13 around at 8.99 or maybe even drop
[2:55:22.840 --> 2:55:29.240]  it to 7.99. Yeah, maybe. I don't know. For the foreseeable future. I do think it would be kind of
[2:55:29.240 --> 2:55:35.080]  weird if they had 11, 12 and 13 on sale at the same time. It just seems like two, that seems
[2:55:35.080 --> 2:55:40.120]  a little unhappily. Seems like to me, like maybe the 11, you know, what's the point of the 11?
[2:55:40.120 --> 2:55:45.080]  Is it to be 11 inches or is it to be the even, you know, the super smallest and lightest?
[2:55:46.040 --> 2:55:51.320]  Well, I think that this 12-inch, which seems to have a footprint mostly like the 11 and with
[2:55:51.320 --> 2:55:55.960]  the wise is apparently the same width as the 11 and has a bigger screen because it has a smaller
[2:55:55.960 --> 2:56:01.880]  bezel. I'd say there's no reason for the 11 to exist. Yeah, the 11 has such a wide bezel that
[2:56:01.880 --> 2:56:05.800]  it really has, it does not make good use of its size for the screen. That, you know, the keyboard
[2:56:05.800 --> 2:56:09.320]  makes good use of the size, the body, but like the screen, like you look at that and like, man,
[2:56:09.320 --> 2:56:12.920]  I wish that bezel was thinner and the screen was bigger. I'm looking at it right now and it just
[2:56:12.920 --> 2:56:18.760]  looks ridiculous. It looks outdated. It looks like the laptops from when, you know, I was, you know,
[2:56:18.760 --> 2:56:23.640]  in college and they, you know, we're just like tiny little thing in the middle of a huge bezel
[2:56:25.560 --> 2:56:29.880]  that they didn't even come close to taking up the full sides of the display panel. Yeah,
[2:56:29.880 --> 2:56:36.600]  exactly. Yeah, I'm guessing, I'm guessing this thing is real. I'm guessing it comes out in the
[2:56:36.600 --> 2:56:41.800]  next couple of months, like soon, not not June. I'm guessing this comes out like this winter,
[2:56:42.920 --> 2:56:46.760]  possibly announced at the same event as the Apple Watch release date, I don't know.
[2:56:46.760 --> 2:56:53.000]  And possibly the iPad Maxi. I don't see, I'm still not entirely convinced that's a real thing
[2:56:53.000 --> 2:56:57.560]  or that it's imminent rather. I don't know. We'll see what happens. I have a lot of people,
[2:56:57.560 --> 2:57:01.560]  or I've seen a lot of people, and I think it's just, you're not thinking this through. People
[2:57:01.560 --> 2:57:05.960]  thinking that, well, you know, remember the old jobs trick where there was the internet communicator,
[2:57:05.960 --> 2:57:11.880]  a phone and a widescreen video iPad, you know, not three products. It's one product. Well,
[2:57:11.880 --> 2:57:16.760]  there's, you know, 12 inch MacBook and a 12 inch iPad and a MacBook and a Macbook and a Mac.
[2:57:16.760 --> 2:57:20.760]  Guess what? It's one device and it's an iPad and it has a keyboard and it's like, no.
[2:57:21.480 --> 2:57:25.160]  No, I definitely don't like, and I even said like, I even tweeted the other day, like,
[2:57:25.160 --> 2:57:31.000]  I've, I've long suspected that that the rumors are for one device, but I meant that in the
[2:57:31.000 --> 2:57:34.840]  sense that like people are misinterpreting the rumors. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. In the sense that
[2:57:34.840 --> 2:57:40.120]  this is a combined iPad and MacBook like that. Right. That Apple's out in Asia sourcing these 12
[2:57:40.120 --> 2:57:45.240]  inch. Right. And they all, and they play things. Oh, that must be for a bigger iPad, but no,
[2:57:45.240 --> 2:57:50.760]  maybe it's also just for a smaller MacBook. But I've, a few people have told me that they
[2:57:50.760 --> 2:57:55.080]  have solid information from rumor sources, blah, blah, blah, blah. This really is two different devices
[2:57:55.080 --> 2:58:00.520]  that are really separate. So fine. It doesn't really matter. But I, yeah, I, I, I don't know,
[2:58:00.520 --> 2:58:05.640]  I can't possibly be less excited about it, about a 12 inch iPad. No, you know, that's what Syracuse
[2:58:05.640 --> 2:58:11.160]  wants. It is what Syracuse wants, but he also wants like pro OS features to be added to make it,
[2:58:11.160 --> 2:58:16.600]  you know, better to be for multitasking and pro work. And I just, I don't see a good way for that
[2:58:16.600 --> 2:58:21.560]  to be bold one to iOS. I, it's not say they're not going to try. They might try. I don't know.
[2:58:21.560 --> 2:58:28.680]  But I think, I think the MacBook Air and this new, you know, quote, MacBooks stealth, whatever
[2:58:28.680 --> 2:58:34.280]  this new 12 inch thing is going to be called, I think that is Apple's answer to pro ultra mobile
[2:58:34.280 --> 2:58:40.520]  computing. Like it's the Mac, but smaller. Yeah. It's not trying to bolt on a bunch of pro
[2:58:40.520 --> 2:58:47.320]  multitasking power user features onto the iPad. Uh, I think, what do you, german doesn't say
[2:58:47.320 --> 2:58:51.560]  the most curious thing to me is he doesn't mention retina display. Doesn't say has one doesn't
[2:58:51.560 --> 2:58:55.560]  say it doesn't have one. Right. Doesn't say which to me is crazy. I think it has to have a retina
[2:58:55.560 --> 2:59:00.680]  display because I don't think you can introduce new products anymore, or at least Apple can't
[2:59:00.680 --> 2:59:05.640]  that aren't. Like there's never going to be a non retina watch. The watch starts retina,
[2:59:05.640 --> 2:59:11.160]  right. Everything new is a retina. Yeah. I, I, I think it would have to be right. I mean,
[2:59:11.160 --> 2:59:15.240]  right. And then I think the name is obvious. You just call it the MacBook Air with retina display,
[2:59:15.240 --> 2:59:19.400]  and it does, you don't have to say that it's 12. Yeah, that makes sense. MacBook Air with retina
[2:59:19.400 --> 2:59:24.920]  display. And now it's, it, they can use the air name, which I think has great brand equity,
[2:59:25.560 --> 2:59:30.040]  and also make it very clear that it's the new thing because it's the retina display,
[2:59:30.040 --> 2:59:36.360]  just like the MacBook pro with retina display. I think the, the, the rumor, I don't know if it
[2:59:36.360 --> 2:59:39.560]  was in german's report or someone else's, but the rumor that it might come in space gray is kind
[2:59:39.560 --> 2:59:45.640]  of exciting. Yeah, and gold. That's less exciting, but the space. Well, right, because I would
[2:59:45.640 --> 2:59:50.200]  definitely buy the space gray one. If it comes in space, create that would be the first thing that
[2:59:50.200 --> 2:59:56.280]  puts a, a, tens of desire in my heart. Yeah, because I mean, I'll tell you like, like the, the Mac
[2:59:56.280 --> 3:00:01.240]  Pro, the new cylinder Mac Pro, that looks awesome in person. Like have it, because that, that is
[3:00:01.240 --> 3:00:04.200]  basically a space gray color. It's, I don't think it's exactly the same color as the phones,
[3:00:04.200 --> 3:00:08.360]  but it's very close. And it has a, it has a glossy finish. So it's, but it's, it's in the ballpark.
[3:00:08.920 --> 3:00:12.760]  It looks so awesome in person. Like you just feel like a badass having that on your desk. It
[3:00:12.760 --> 3:00:19.560]  just looks fantastic. And I, and I definitely think the, the, you know, be blasted aluminum look
[3:00:19.560 --> 3:00:25.480]  that we've had an Apple products. For my entire time using Apple products, um, I think that's,
[3:00:25.480 --> 3:00:29.720]  that is in many ways a timeless look that will never go fully out of style. However,
[3:00:30.360 --> 3:00:33.800]  it'd be nice to see something a little bit new, a little bit fresh in that area if it's possible
[3:00:33.800 --> 3:00:38.680]  and if it doesn't suck. So if, if they can make a space gray version of it, I think it would be,
[3:00:38.680 --> 3:00:44.120]  it would be a nice change of pace. Yeah, and wouldn't the, the white version be lighter? Like I don't
[3:00:44.120 --> 3:00:52.840]  have a, a white, uh, iPhone handy here. But I'm, I'm thinking that the, if an upside down white
[3:00:52.840 --> 3:00:57.640]  iPhone is a lighter shade of aluminum than a MacBook. I don't think that's true. Maybe it's the
[3:00:57.640 --> 3:01:01.160]  same. Yeah, I think it's the same. But it would look different if they use white for the bezel though.
[3:01:02.360 --> 3:01:06.200]  Yeah, that's, yeah, that is true. Assuming it has like the, because like, you know, the current
[3:01:06.200 --> 3:01:10.840]  MacBook Airs have the metal bezel the way the old apps used to, if it, if it adopts the,
[3:01:10.840 --> 3:01:15.240]  like, you know, glass goes edge to edge and the bezel is like this black surround or yeah,
[3:01:15.240 --> 3:01:19.160]  then it could be white. You're right. Yeah, but space gray would be cool. The most inexplicable thing
[3:01:19.160 --> 3:01:25.480]  that german's, uh, renderings have, and I just don't get this is why they have the power key
[3:01:25.480 --> 3:01:30.760]  where the escape key has been since forever. Oh, I hope that's wrong. I really, I saw that too. And I'm
[3:01:30.760 --> 3:01:35.080]  like, oh, that's gonna be annoying. I can't help but think that that's just a mistake,
[3:01:35.080 --> 3:01:38.680]  you know, because it's their commissioning. But then again, wouldn't the mistake, wouldn't it be
[3:01:38.680 --> 3:01:44.520]  easier, you know, to just use a keyboard layout that you've already had? Why, you know,
[3:01:44.520 --> 3:01:48.760]  seems like it would be more work in Photoshop or whatever it used to build this to move that.
[3:01:48.760 --> 3:01:53.800]  Well, because the, and the existing 11 inch fits it just fine, like it puts it above, uh,
[3:01:53.800 --> 3:01:58.920]  backspace, right? Well, it, by definition, it would, it could go on either side, right? You just slide
[3:01:58.920 --> 3:02:02.760]  over all the keys and put it in the top right where it's been forever. And it's not so much
[3:02:02.760 --> 3:02:07.800]  that I want to hit that power key, but it, that I do use the escape key. And I don't want to put
[3:02:07.800 --> 3:02:11.960]  my MacBook to sleep when I just reach up there blindly and hit the top right key. You know,
[3:02:11.960 --> 3:02:16.360]  what though, I just realized, you know, I think we are numbered here. I think most people hit
[3:02:16.360 --> 3:02:20.600]  backspace a heck of a lot more often than they hit escape. Oh, and maybe that's why they
[3:02:20.600 --> 3:02:26.440]  lost it. Oh, man. Oh, so the explanation, maybe, and then they'll move it on all the keyboards.
[3:02:26.440 --> 3:02:30.360]  Yeah, because, you know, already, like, you can't just tap it. Like, you have to, like,
[3:02:30.360 --> 3:02:34.360]  hold it down for a second. Yeah, same thing with that. But yeah, now, like, now, when you're
[3:02:34.360 --> 3:02:37.720]  looking at a keyboard, you're looking at where it is in the 11 inch now, it's above backspace
[3:02:37.720 --> 3:02:41.720]  or delete, rather, sorry, I have a microphone. That's the first logical explanation I've heard
[3:02:41.720 --> 3:02:44.360]  about that. Yeah, that's about that. I guess, I thought about that now, but that's, that's
[3:02:44.360 --> 3:02:48.920]  unfortunate, because it said that sounds extremely plausible and reasonable, even though it would suck
[3:02:48.920 --> 3:02:54.280]  for people like us. Somebody on Twitter said it's that they're a them user, and they can't,
[3:02:54.280 --> 3:02:58.440]  they're, they can't believe Apple would do that. You know, escape here is too important to
[3:02:58.440 --> 3:03:03.960]  them users. And it's like, yep, I'm a them user when I'm on server stuff. And it also, it's also
[3:03:03.960 --> 3:03:08.760]  auto complete and text mate. Like, yeah, man. Well, it's auto complete system wide, isn't it?
[3:03:08.760 --> 3:03:12.840]  It always, I don't know. F5 is to have only ever tried it in text mate. But yeah,
[3:03:12.840 --> 3:03:18.120]  but I think now that I think about the power button being above backspace instead, I think that's
[3:03:18.120 --> 3:03:24.280]  very plausible. Yeah. Oh, I never thought of that. Our screwed. Well, let's keep the show short.
[3:03:24.280 --> 3:03:29.960]  Let's wrap it up. You're always very good at keeping the show. I am. I am very good at the
[3:03:29.960 --> 3:03:35.800]  in the last 30 seconds of keeping the show short. Marco Arment, thank you. Thank you for the time and
[3:03:35.800 --> 3:03:43.720]  a lot of good conversation tonight. People can find out more at your suddenly very popular website
[3:03:43.720 --> 3:03:52.120]  Marco.org. Your Twitter is at Marco Arment. My goal to lose as many people as possible for my
[3:03:52.120 --> 3:03:56.920]  audience by blocking about really boring developer stuff for a while. And of course, we got to mention
[3:03:56.920 --> 3:04:01.480]  ATP. Anybody, I can't, I just got to be so much overlap. But if there's that, if you're out there,
[3:04:01.480 --> 3:04:07.480]  and you like it when Marco's on the talk show, you got to listen to ATP. It's it's my favorite podcast.
[3:04:07.480 --> 3:04:18.280]  And I'd say that completely honestly. So ATP is at ATP dot FM six characters for including the
[3:04:18.280 --> 3:04:23.080]  dot. Yeah, FM is pretty wide open to the cost like 70 bucks a year to register. So it's
[3:04:23.080 --> 3:04:27.640]  pretty easy to still get pretty good stuff there. Yeah. And it works, you know, works with the podcast
[3:04:27.640 --> 3:04:36.280]  angle. Yeah, exactly. So check those three things out and wait for Marco to burn the internet down
[3:04:36.280 --> 3:04:44.280]  next week. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It was so great. I love it now that I just
[3:04:44.280 --> 3:05:00.200]  given up on keeping shows the reasonable length. Oh, yeah. Screw it.
