[00:00.000 --> 00:13.520]  Hello. Welcome to the talk show. A few things up front before we get started. I want to
[00:13.520 --> 00:24.220]  thank MailChimp. MailChimp is sponsoring this open bar. So raise a glass to MailChimp. Everybody
[00:24.220 --> 00:27.660]  here is drinking on their dime. Great email. If you've never heard of them, they do great
[00:27.660 --> 00:34.800]  email newsletters. So go get another drink and then later tonight go set up a drunk newsletter
[00:34.800 --> 00:42.960]  with MailChimp. I want to thank Microsoft, our flagship event sponsor. They've got the
[00:42.960 --> 00:47.340]  banners here. This is the second year in a row that they've sponsored this event, Azure
[00:47.340 --> 00:52.980]  Mobile Services. Truly, truly great stuff. A year ago, I think it maybe was a little
[00:52.980 --> 00:59.160]  bit weirder that Microsoft and their online stuff was sponsoring this show at this conference.
[00:59.160 --> 01:04.980]  And I think this year it's a little bit less weird. I don't know. I mean, you guys know
[01:04.980 --> 01:08.640]  that with the stuff we're doing at Qbrands with Vesper, we're using them. We build our
[01:08.640 --> 01:13.120]  entire back end on their stuff. Certainly wouldn't do that just because they sponsored
[01:13.120 --> 01:17.500]  the show. I'm happy that they're sponsoring the show because I really like their stuff.
[01:17.500 --> 01:21.860]  Really amazing stuff. So if you're building anything with an online component, I really,
[01:21.860 --> 01:27.000]  really encourage you to look at what they have to offer. It's really great even if you're
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.860]  like us and only developed for iOS and macOS. Even if you're really, really firmly in the
[01:32.860 --> 01:42.560]  Apple developer ecosystem, they have great options. And so check them out. How many people
[01:42.560 --> 01:47.840]  here have ever checked out Azure Mobile Services? Well, we've got to get that up by the end
[01:47.840 --> 01:54.200]  of the night. So maybe I'll go backstage and let you guys investigate your online storage
[01:54.200 --> 02:02.840]  needs. No, I'm going to get started. So the first part of the show, I have three very
[02:02.840 --> 02:24.580]  special guests. I have the guys from ATP, Marco Arment, John Siracusa, and Casey Liss. Alright,
[02:24.580 --> 02:32.760]  so we've each got mics. This is nice, soft leather. They always put Casey in the middle.
[02:32.760 --> 02:36.740]  I was expecting him to be at the edge, so it'd be, oh yeah, just sit there and look
[02:36.740 --> 02:42.040]  pretty for a while. You're good. Even when they build themselves, I think it's Marco
[02:42.040 --> 02:46.800]  Arment, Casey Liss, and John Siracusa. You're always in the middle. I know, it's obvious.
[02:46.800 --> 02:54.120]  By surname. Well, it flows really nicely that way. Save the best for last. First I made
[02:54.120 --> 03:02.420]  the site, and I kind of cheated. So, do we all agree this was a big WWDC, a big king
[03:02.420 --> 03:10.720]  of, right? Everybody agrees? Oh yeah. I was sitting in the press section, two or three
[03:10.720 --> 03:14.720]  seats away from John, and I took a picture. It didn't come out because it's so dark in
[03:14.720 --> 03:19.680]  the area with the, you know, the audience isn't lit, the stage is lit. But I got a picture
[03:19.680 --> 03:26.160]  of him looking happy. That's amazing. We were so disappointed because generally for the
[03:26.160 --> 03:31.360]  last few years it's been the three of us in the keynote, and we were genuinely disappointed
[03:31.360 --> 03:36.240]  that we couldn't see his like victory dance in his seat because, you know, I'm assuming
[03:36.240 --> 03:40.360]  that there was some sort of complete spaz attack that happened. It's like an out of
[03:40.360 --> 03:45.720]  body experience. I didn't have much recollection of that when the Swift slide went up. I had
[03:45.720 --> 03:49.920]  already tweeted earlier in the thing, is this real life, when he called Dr. Dre. So I couldn't
[03:49.920 --> 03:52.480]  use that one again, but it's exactly what I was thinking. Is this real life? Does that
[03:52.480 --> 03:57.920]  slide really go up? Well, you know, the reality is like wild exuberance from John is, you
[03:57.920 --> 04:04.220]  know, just like. Right. I had a big smile. I showed teeth. There are pictures. Come on.
[04:04.220 --> 04:08.000]  So they announced, you know, so I forget the exact way they framed it, but it was, look,
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.040]  we've got this SDK and there's the awkward thing where Tim Cook had to explain, you know,
[04:12.040 --> 04:17.360]  for everybody out here who's never heard of an SDK, it's a software development kit. And
[04:17.360 --> 04:20.600]  there is this weird thing there where it's like, come on, come on, really? You're going
[04:20.600 --> 04:25.720]  to explain what SDK is at a developer conference? I know that this is being simulcast to a hundred
[04:25.720 --> 04:31.000]  million people and there's press and these people don't really get it, but come on. But
[04:31.000 --> 04:37.680]  then, you know, it was, we're proud to announce today, we're introducing a brand new programming
[04:37.680 --> 04:43.720]  language. And I look over at John and it was still no reaction. And I think it was like,
[04:43.720 --> 04:49.540]  I think his initial thought was, ah, there's gotta be a catch. I don't even remember when
[04:49.540 --> 04:55.640]  he said that. All I remember is the, the orange Swift logo. And I was just, seriously, I have
[04:55.640 --> 05:00.280]  very little recollection. I was just, I was happy. I was just so happy that this was really
[05:00.280 --> 05:02.980]  happening. And then like everyone else was like, everyone else, like you're seeing this
[05:02.980 --> 05:10.000]  too, right? Was it like, wasn't the Grinch where like the smile just like very slowly
[05:10.000 --> 05:14.760]  to spreads. And I can only imagine, I'm very jealous that you got to witness this first
[05:14.760 --> 05:20.040]  hand. Yeah, I, I, it was the highlight of the keynote for me was seeing his reaction
[05:20.040 --> 05:25.000]  because it really was. And I feel like then they kind of immediately kind of framed it
[05:25.000 --> 05:31.000]  that way where it was sort of a, if you've been following this platform long enough,
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.720]  you hear new programming language and it's like, well, is it going to be another bridge?
[05:34.720 --> 05:39.580]  Is it, we mean new programming language, like new to you, it's going to be Python or you're
[05:39.580 --> 05:45.320]  going to elevate the Ruby or, you know, or is it the real deal? Is it really a new Apple
[05:45.320 --> 05:50.280]  programming language custom built for our frameworks? And it's like, Holy shit. Yes,
[05:50.280 --> 05:56.160]  it is. Yeah. Different, different syntax. It's not objective C 4.0. You know, all the
[05:56.160 --> 05:59.920]  things that they could have done if it's the whole, the whole debate amongst all of us
[05:59.920 --> 06:02.960]  is like, Oh, why, why do they need a new language? They could just do X, they can just do Y look
[06:02.960 --> 06:06.520]  at how they've improved objective C. And it's like, I mean, nobody thought that they would
[06:06.520 --> 06:10.120]  ever settle that they'll sell that debate. It's, you know, it's, it's unequivocal. It
[06:10.120 --> 06:16.960]  looks unlike objective C in any way. All right. So how much have you guys looked at Swift
[06:16.960 --> 06:21.660]  so far? Only a little bit. And I didn't go to, did you know you went to the introduction
[06:21.660 --> 06:26.000]  to Swiss. I mean, if we had all just had time to read that big books or PDF thing, we would
[06:26.000 --> 06:29.020]  know a lot about it, but we haven't. But I bet if you read that, you know more than you
[06:29.020 --> 06:35.280]  knew from going to that session. Yeah. I mean, I, I poke, I poke through, I poke through
[06:35.280 --> 06:38.640]  that book with little bits and pieces to see things that I thought like were interesting.
[06:38.640 --> 06:42.720]  Like we were talking the other night about how closures were going to be handled and
[06:42.720 --> 06:46.560]  whether or not you needed to do memory stuff. And it turns out, yeah, you need to do that.
[06:46.560 --> 06:52.080]  But I mean, really, I'm just thrilled that it's not Pearl because dealing with dealing
[06:52.080 --> 06:58.820]  with almost Pearl, dealing with the smugness of it just being a new language angle on there
[06:58.820 --> 07:03.400]  too. Although they list Ruby as a thing, but come on, Ruby is an influence. I think Ruby
[07:03.400 --> 07:07.280]  got influenced. I'm going to cut you off because this is my, I want to let you guys shine,
[07:07.280 --> 07:15.880]  but I, I listen to ATP every week. I don't need another episode because that's a whole
[07:15.880 --> 07:20.360]  that you complained about Pearl and forget it. We're not no more Pearl. Last time we
[07:20.360 --> 07:27.720]  say that we have months of material for our show out of this. When is the last time? I
[07:27.720 --> 07:32.680]  don't know. I did. I, like usual, I've done no research. When is the last time Apple introduced
[07:32.680 --> 07:38.480]  its own programming language off the top of my head? I want to say Apple script. Dylan,
[07:38.480 --> 07:43.840]  maybe. Yeah, Dylan, but Dylan never did it ship. Could you ever write an actual thing
[07:43.840 --> 07:48.680]  in the real world using it? I don't know. Maybe not. Right. This court's composer count
[07:48.680 --> 07:54.360]  for anything. I don't think that's a programming line. I think Apple script was the last hyper
[07:54.360 --> 08:01.080]  talk, right? No, Apple script came after hyper talk. Hyper talk was first. I'm almost sure
[08:01.080 --> 08:08.080]  somebody look at someone in the chat room. Look at it. Right. No, I think, I think off
[08:08.080 --> 08:12.740]  the top of my head, I'm going to say hypercard was like 1989 or so. And Apple script came
[08:12.740 --> 08:17.280]  out and somewhere in a system seven year or so it was, I think it was like system seven
[08:17.280 --> 08:22.800]  one. You could be right. And I think that big picture, not getting down into the nitty
[08:22.800 --> 08:27.760]  gritty of the details of what Swift is actually like as a programming language, zoom out and
[08:27.760 --> 08:33.320]  just kind of look at it and get the basics. I really do think that it is a very appley
[08:33.320 --> 08:39.640]  programming language or at least representative of today's Apple, the modern. I was going
[08:39.640 --> 08:44.440]  to say like Dylan represents the nineties Apple and Apple script. I think Apple script
[08:44.440 --> 08:53.680]  is very much of a language of and, and by 1991, 92 Apple where, you know, the whole
[08:53.680 --> 08:58.920]  idea of, um, we're not going to make programmers happy. We're going to make regular people
[08:58.920 --> 09:02.940]  programmers or even just like the hippie dippy kind of academic language. Like I have a high
[09:02.940 --> 09:06.560] falutin idea and I'm going to embody that idea and a beautiful, perfect language or
[09:06.560 --> 09:11.980]  whatever it, whereas, you know, Swift is pragmatic. It's, it's Chris Latner eyes. Like it is 100%
[09:11.980 --> 09:15.520]  like everything else they've done. It's like down brass tacks. We need this thing to do
[09:15.520 --> 09:18.880]  X, Y, and Z, and we're going to make it. And if it's a little bit ugly, we don't care.
[09:18.880 --> 09:25.320]  Totally pragmatic. Yeah. I, and I compare it. My analogy is to the use of Helvetica
[09:25.320 --> 09:34.200]  throughout the UI on iOS and now on, on OS 10 Helvetica is a great font and I, I've always
[09:34.200 --> 09:39.520]  been a big fan of it, but it's also famously a very plain font. Some people, a lot of people
[09:39.520 --> 09:43.760]  consider it to be the most neutral font that exists that, that, that, you know, they call
[09:43.760 --> 09:48.000]  it Swiss typography, but that it, you know, I think part of the reason that phrase even
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.080]  comes on, not just that the Swiss used fonts like Helvetica, but that it's the sense of
[09:52.080 --> 09:57.000]  neutrality. And when you use Helvetica for anything, nobody ever says, my God, you're
[09:57.000 --> 10:02.800]  so clever. You found this amazing font that I never heard of. It's a very plain font.
[10:02.800 --> 10:06.640]  And, and I think what, like when they first unveiled the iPhone, I remember people complained
[10:06.640 --> 10:12.960]  about it that, wow, what an uninspiring choice Helvetica. I think Swift is that kind of programming
[10:12.960 --> 10:19.920]  language where there's no real amazing complicated. It's got weird serifs though. Like it is,
[10:19.920 --> 10:23.440]  I think Swift has pointy edges. I think the more you look into it, the more you see some
[10:23.440 --> 10:26.960]  strain. It's kind of more of a mongrel. It's like Helvetica, but occasionally like they
[10:26.960 --> 10:31.400]  have like dingbats in the middle of a couple of days. Right. It's like Helvetica and they've
[10:31.400 --> 10:41.280]  added a couple of Apple specific emojis right to the main character set. So you, Marco,
[10:41.280 --> 10:51.080]  you haven't looked at it yet. So. Well, you know, I think it's not PHP, you know. I've
[10:51.080 --> 10:55.280]  looked at it, you know, for 10 minutes. So, you know, none of us, well, unless there's
[10:55.280 --> 10:59.160]  random Apple people here, although even they didn't use much of it yet, but none of us
[10:59.160 --> 11:03.300]  have really used it yet. You know, we're not going to know whether it's a good language
[11:03.300 --> 11:08.120]  or not for a while. You know, it's going to, because it takes, you have to almost master
[11:08.120 --> 11:13.540]  a language to really know whether it's good or not. And usually most languages aren't,
[11:13.540 --> 11:17.340]  you know, categorically good or bad. There's, you know, pluses and minuses. So I think right
[11:17.340 --> 11:23.140]  now you can look at it the same way that when a whole rush of programmers came to iOS for
[11:23.140 --> 11:27.120]  the first time to make apps for the app store in the big gold rush, everyone looked at Objective
[11:27.120 --> 11:30.680]  C and was like, what a weird language. There's all these brackets everywhere, and what the
[11:30.680 --> 11:35.360]  heck does that method definition, what's that weird syntax? And it looked weird and foreign
[11:35.360 --> 11:39.600]  to them, but the language is actually much better than that once you get used to it.
[11:39.600 --> 11:44.360]  With Swift, I think we're looking at it now, and a lot of us are saying, this is amazing.
[11:44.360 --> 11:47.440]  But it might actually end up being worse than we think, because we aren't familiar with
[11:47.440 --> 11:51.620]  it yet. It's probably going to be better than we think. But it's going to take just a while
[11:51.620 --> 11:54.400]  before any of us are familiar enough to really make that call.
[11:54.400 --> 12:01.120]  I think it has the same effect as the new look for iOS 7 or Yosemite. When they put
[12:01.120 --> 12:05.720]  Objective C up on the slides now, after you've seen Swift for a while, you can't go back
[12:05.720 --> 12:10.560]  to look at the old. Whether it's better or not, it's such a huge leap over Objective
[12:10.560 --> 12:15.360]  C in terms of capabilities and compactness and expressiveness that it's really hard to
[12:15.360 --> 12:18.160]  go back and look at Objective C examples, because you see all this noise that's not
[12:18.160 --> 12:23.440]  there in Swift, and I don't think we'll ever be able to go back. No matter how Swift ends
[12:23.440 --> 12:27.360]  up, maybe it has terrible warts or real design problems or whatever, it's clear that Apple's
[12:27.360 --> 12:31.920]  committed to it, and we're going to be using it. Well, you guys are.
[12:31.920 --> 12:36.920]  It's also kind of weird that it came out as this fully formed idea. They mentioned they
[12:36.920 --> 12:43.600]  were going to revise it slightly over time with our feedback, but it came out of nowhere,
[12:43.600 --> 12:48.640]  and all of a sudden it's, boom, this pretty advanced language with tons of capabilities
[12:48.640 --> 12:55.080]  out of the blue, and fully designed within this little subset, this very small subset
[12:55.080 --> 12:59.080]  of Apple, fully designed here. This is our new language, period.
[12:59.080 --> 13:06.440]  Yeah, it came out, and it not only wasn't leaked or rumored, it wasn't even on people's
[13:06.440 --> 13:13.320]  wish list. There was one of us.
[13:13.320 --> 13:20.040]  I don't think any of us expected this would come out this year at all. Many of us, myself
[13:20.040 --> 13:26.000]  included, didn't expect Objective C to be replaced for the next decade.
[13:26.000 --> 13:31.520]  You mentioned this specifically, that it's Tuesday. We've only known about it for 36
[13:31.520 --> 13:38.280]  hours or so. You're not going to say, hey, when I rewrite the overcast download manager
[13:38.280 --> 13:44.040]  for the fifth time, I'm going to use Swift. Please no.
[13:44.040 --> 13:49.360]  But it does seem like, it seems like one of the ways that I think it, I would bet heavily
[13:49.360 --> 13:55.680]  on it working out and very quickly, you know, like in a way, like that whatever you thought
[13:55.680 --> 13:59.840]  about the iOS 7 look when it first came out, whether you loved it right away or you hate
[13:59.840 --> 14:05.680]  it or whatever, I think a year in to the, you know, to the week, when you look back
[14:05.680 --> 14:11.560]  at the old iOS, it's like, ooh, there, you know, it's really looks bad. It looks old.
[14:11.560 --> 14:15.440]  And I think that it's not going to take long before Objective C takes on that look of,
[14:15.440 --> 14:16.440]  oh my God.
[14:16.440 --> 14:17.440]  We're already there, I think.
[14:17.440 --> 14:18.440]  Right.
[14:18.440 --> 14:22.440]  Oh, absolutely. I mean, and during the presentations, they'll flip back and forth between slides
[14:22.440 --> 14:26.240]  and Objective C and slides and Swift. And just like John said, the moment you get back
[14:26.240 --> 14:30.080]  to Objective C, it's like, well, that feels cushy and familiar, but ooh, that, it's like
[14:30.080 --> 14:33.920]  an old girlfriend or boyfriend, right? You know, it's like at the time that was, I really
[14:33.920 --> 14:40.040]  liked him or her, but now 10, 15 years on, ooh, they didn't do too well after that.
[14:40.040 --> 14:41.040]  Wow.
[14:41.040 --> 14:53.240]  But I, there's two ways, two ways that I think that it, it's going to get uptake quickly
[14:53.240 --> 14:58.480]  is one is that they're, they still have all the same frameworks. The frameworks are the
[14:58.480 --> 15:03.520]  same. It's a new language on top of the framework. So they're not saying we've introduced this
[15:03.520 --> 15:08.480]  new thing and it's all new and it's the next generation thing and you kind of have to go
[15:08.480 --> 15:12.920]  all in at once and oh, and we've only done this much of it so far. It's already all of
[15:12.920 --> 15:18.280]  the frameworks and I think that's huge and it means that you can think about starting
[15:18.280 --> 15:21.800]  to use it right away. And then I think the other thing is the way that they're really
[15:21.800 --> 15:26.400]  encouraging and emphasizing, at least I've seen so far just in the first day, that you
[15:26.400 --> 15:31.640]  can start taking existing apps and just rewrite one class using Swift and you know, just go
[15:31.640 --> 15:36.280]  like that or just start adding your new, you know, new features in Swift and keep the old
[15:36.280 --> 15:40.160]  stuff. You don't have to rewrite the whole app. You don't have to have a Swift app or
[15:40.160 --> 15:45.400]  an Objective-C app. They're just cocoa apps and parts are written in Objective-C and parts
[15:45.400 --> 15:46.400]  are written in Swift.
[15:46.400 --> 15:50.080]  Yeah, we saw this before with Arc, what is it, two years ago, something like that. It
[15:50.080 --> 15:54.000]  was a similar situation where look at this really new, cool thing and you can use it
[15:54.000 --> 15:58.720]  selectively here and there, but clearly it's in everyone's best interest. It's in Apple's
[15:58.720 --> 16:03.080]  best interest. It's in our best interest to embrace this and really run with it. And so
[16:03.080 --> 16:06.360]  it's a very similar tact as to what happened with Arc.
[16:06.360 --> 16:11.000]  I'm also pretty confident that, you know, if you think about, I think the chances of
[16:11.000 --> 16:15.640]  this being a very good language are very high because Objective-C is a very good language
[16:15.640 --> 16:21.480]  in a lot of ways. I'm a big fan of it. Probably because I know it. I like PHP, but that's,
[16:21.480 --> 16:28.120]  we all know, you know. But if you think about the amount of thought and criticism that must
[16:28.120 --> 16:33.800]  have come to this language during its development from the people at Apple who decide what programming
[16:33.800 --> 16:40.280]  language they use, those people are probably not only very smart, but also extremely critical
[16:40.280 --> 16:45.700]  and careful when making a change like this. And so I think it's very, very likely to end
[16:45.700 --> 16:48.720]  up being a very good language because of how it came to be.
[16:48.720 --> 16:51.320]  But what about the small, we were talking about this backstage too, what about the small
[16:51.320 --> 16:54.560]  group of people that have seen this? Because it has been so secret and some Apple, some
[16:54.560 --> 16:58.440]  groups inside Apple have been looking at it, but like, I think, I'm going to test it out
[16:58.440 --> 17:02.200]  with the developers here in the audience, I'm presuming, like when they showed you dot
[17:02.200 --> 17:06.840]  dot and dot dot dot and explained how they were different, didn't you all like, right
[17:06.840 --> 17:10.100]  after the slide where they told you about how they don't have fall throughs on the case
[17:10.100 --> 17:13.840]  statements and require brackets on the ifs, but then we made our own mistake that you're
[17:13.840 --> 17:17.760]  going to regret 20 years from now. We made two different operators that differ by a period
[17:17.760 --> 17:22.160]  that behave differently to make off by one errors. I don't think that would have survived
[17:22.160 --> 17:27.040]  like contact with the outside world. And so it shows that the group that they have inside
[17:27.040 --> 17:30.600]  Apple, like, I mean, I'm not saying it's like insular, but they have to keep it secret for
[17:30.600 --> 17:31.600]  four years.
[17:31.600 --> 17:38.560]  All right. Time out. I'll explain. It's called a range operator. Yeah, but there's thousands
[17:38.560 --> 17:45.320]  of people out there listening to the show later. I'm talking to them. So there's something
[17:45.320 --> 17:52.800]  called a range operator and you can write that like the digit one dot dot dot five. And that returns
[17:52.800 --> 17:59.160]  an array of one, two, three, four or five. It fills it in with it knows if it are integers,
[17:59.160 --> 18:05.000]  it knows that the ones in the middle are the dot, dot, dot. It's explained counting to
[18:05.000 --> 18:14.120]  the audience. Good job. But if you only use two dots, if you do one dot dot five, it doesn't
[18:14.120 --> 18:19.640]  return the last item. It returns one, two, three, four. The missing dot means don't give
[18:19.640 --> 18:25.520]  me the last one. And so it, it makes total sense to a Pearl programmer. No, I think you
[18:25.520 --> 18:28.840]  said that isn't two dots includes both end points and three dots doesn't include the
[18:28.840 --> 18:35.320]  last one. I forget. No, no more dots includes more. Anyway, I didn't come up with a demonic
[18:35.320 --> 18:39.640]  corporate out. Pearl uses just two dots and it's a range operator. It's also a flip flop
[18:39.640 --> 18:44.480]  and scalar context, but don't worry about it. But, but yeah, but like, no, that's, that's
[18:44.480 --> 18:49.320]  the type of mistake that makes me wonder about, about it. And again, they said that we reserved
[18:49.320 --> 18:52.480]  the right to change the syntax. We hope we'll get feedback. So it's not a big deal, but
[18:52.480 --> 18:56.840]  like, you know, that being secret for four years is going to have effects. It really
[18:56.840 --> 19:03.440]  says something. This feature is so bad. It's not even in PHP. It's not a PHP yet. Give
[19:03.440 --> 19:10.360]  me that. I do think, and you know, programming language is no different in broad aspects
[19:10.360 --> 19:14.080]  from anything, even something visual. And it, I think Apple runs into this time and
[19:14.080 --> 19:19.400]  time again with the secrecy and the way you keep stuff secret is by keeping it a small
[19:19.400 --> 19:23.840]  team and not going outside the team. And then the smaller the team, the more likely that
[19:23.840 --> 19:29.040]  there's some sort of blind spot on the team. And when we ever, we see a major new initiative,
[19:29.040 --> 19:33.680]  I think iOS seven is a good example. And that probably wasn't a super tightly held secret
[19:33.680 --> 19:39.200]  within the company, but it was secret enough that there weren't screenshots that leaked.
[19:39.200 --> 19:45.880]  And what they showed us a year ago at WWDC had a couple of really glaring, like, really,
[19:45.880 --> 19:50.800]  you're going to go that thin on the font for mail that I can't see it. It's not so much
[19:50.800 --> 19:55.680]  a blind spot is that the group that's doing it has a hierarchy. And so even if there's
[19:55.680 --> 19:59.320]  feedback within the group that we think this is a bad idea, if enough people in charge
[19:59.320 --> 20:02.680]  don't think it is, they overweight the masses. Whereas when you put it out to the public,
[20:02.680 --> 20:07.220]  then it's, you know, what, however many million iOS programmers out there sending feedback
[20:07.220 --> 20:10.960]  and that is like, all right, well, we can't, there's no hierarchy among them. It's just,
[20:10.960 --> 20:15.720]  you know, that's the public telling, oh, there is, well, it's not, it's not as straightforward
[20:15.720 --> 20:20.800]  as reporting relationships inside Apple corporate. So one of the other things I took away from
[20:20.800 --> 20:26.360]  the keynote yesterday is, and I think it's very, I don't see how anybody could deny it.
[20:26.360 --> 20:30.640]  I think it was a year ago at the, the all things D conference. Now it's the recode conference,
[20:30.640 --> 20:33.840]  but I think that's when Tim Cook said that he was going to, Apple was going to double
[20:33.840 --> 20:37.620]  down on secrecy. You know, I think that the question was posed to him along the lines
[20:37.620 --> 20:41.040]  of, Hey, you guys are so famously secretive, but you've had some leaks. Are you guys going
[20:41.040 --> 20:44.160]  to open up some more? And he's like, no, no, we're going to double down on secrecy. We're
[20:44.160 --> 20:48.720]  more committed to it than ever. We think our customers like to have a surprise and we think
[20:48.720 --> 20:53.480]  competitively it's to our advantages. And then other stuff leaks, you know, mostly hardware
[20:53.480 --> 20:56.680]  and everybody laughs at it. And it's like, I had Tim Cook says they're doubling down
[20:56.680 --> 21:03.640]  on secrecy, but look at all the stuff that leaks. I think it's very clear at least. And
[21:03.640 --> 21:07.440]  there might be some exception somewhere that I'm thinking, but in general terms, the only
[21:07.440 --> 21:14.160]  stuff that leaks from Apple recently is hardware from the supply chain in Asia. That it just
[21:14.160 --> 21:19.600]  seems like there's too many places there where there's factories and bribes and too many
[21:19.600 --> 21:25.400]  people who are seeing these prototype shells coming out and too much money from the case,
[21:25.400 --> 21:28.860]  you know, the people who make the cases to put on the phone, who want them and willing
[21:28.860 --> 21:32.800]  to pay tens of thousands of dollars to get them so that they can have their case ready
[21:32.800 --> 21:38.480]  before their competitors. But in terms of stuff that just happens at Apple's campus,
[21:38.480 --> 21:44.680]  the secrecy I think is better than ever, especially, you know, the whole programming language,
[21:44.680 --> 21:48.200]  the screenshots like Yosemite. I mean, everybody had guesses what it was going to look like,
[21:48.200 --> 21:50.720]  but to my knowledge, not a single actual screenshot leaked.
[21:50.720 --> 21:56.920]  Yeah, I mean, that's one of the most impressive parts about the keynote is how much stuff
[21:56.920 --> 22:01.960]  blew our minds, not only because it was major, but because we didn't see it coming, you know.
[22:01.960 --> 22:07.160]  And like, you know, Yosemite is a great example. You know, it even like a week ago, two weeks
[22:07.160 --> 22:11.520]  ago, you were predicting that they would have problems with how to deal with window shadows
[22:11.520 --> 22:16.040]  in a new flattened environment because we were all predicting, oh, you know, iOS 7 was
[22:16.040 --> 22:21.300]  a radical redesign and so therefore this is going to be a radical redesign and it's going
[22:21.300 --> 22:24.480]  to look nothing like it did before. And it turns out it looks a lot like it did before.
[22:24.480 --> 22:28.980]  It just, it's, you know, it's an evolution of the design and it's a little bit, you know,
[22:28.980 --> 22:34.440]  it's a bigger step than they usually take in one revision, but you could see them like
[22:34.440 --> 22:39.120]  making small steps over the next four releases getting where it is anyway, you know. And
[22:39.120 --> 22:44.720]  so all these crazy predictions that we had that it would look crazy, you know, just totally
[22:44.720 --> 22:48.960]  unfamiliar, totally different, everything's all flattened with thin lines, that didn't
[22:48.960 --> 22:55.640]  come to be. And what they gave us is something that honestly just makes a lot more sense.
[22:55.640 --> 23:01.960]  Yeah, it doesn't look like iOS, it looks related to iOS, you know, like siblings who don't
[23:01.960 --> 23:06.040]  even look that much alike, but they kind of look clearly like siblings. It's definitely
[23:06.040 --> 23:10.280]  not like iOS running on the iPad, which is what I was kind of worried about. Yeah, oh
[23:10.280 --> 23:13.960]  yeah, I think we were all probably worried about that. And I, you know, I think when
[23:13.960 --> 23:17.840]  they were about to show it, I think we were all probably like, here we go, they're going
[23:17.840 --> 23:20.720]  to kill our beloved Mac, it's going to be really weird and I guess we'll eventually
[23:20.720 --> 23:26.960]  get used to it. But we didn't have to do that, you know, it turns out it's fine. What about
[23:26.960 --> 23:32.000]  the icons? Because that to me is the one thing that everybody loves to gripe about. And in
[23:32.000 --> 23:36.200]  iOS 7, I would say like, like at this time a year ago, I would say 80% of what I was
[23:36.200 --> 23:40.920]  hearing was about how fucking ugly the iOS 7 icons were. And it's like, all right, let's
[23:40.920 --> 23:45.200]  just even concede the point that these icons are ugly. The whole OS was redesigned, can
[23:45.200 --> 23:50.040]  we talk about something else? And I feel like with the Mac OS X, they didn't go to a unified
[23:50.040 --> 23:53.040]  shape, which is what I kind of thought they were going to do, because it just seemed,
[23:53.040 --> 23:57.000]  I didn't know if it would be the same as iOS or if it would be a circle, but I kind of
[23:57.000 --> 24:00.320]  thought they would, because it seemed like that's the direction they were going, but
[24:00.320 --> 24:04.960]  they didn't. It's, you know, they're just a little bit more iOS-y, but not really. They
[24:04.960 --> 24:09.240]  did three shapes, right? Yeah, it was three. It's like the, it's circular and then like
[24:09.240 --> 24:14.200]  a tilted rectangle, right? And then a rounded rectangle or something along those lines.
[24:14.200 --> 24:17.460]  And I actually really like them. I don't know if it's like, ooh, shiny, then I'm just excited
[24:17.460 --> 24:21.300]  about something new, but I actually really like them. I don't like them as much as John
[24:21.300 --> 24:28.960]  likes the settings icon, which is a lot, but no, I do like them overall. Yeah, and I think
[24:28.960 --> 24:35.320]  it's, if you look at what we have today and previous to Yosemite, it was looking a little
[24:35.320 --> 24:38.280]  bit dated. When you have like a dock full of all these icons that are all radically
[24:38.280 --> 24:43.400]  different shapes and some of them haven't been updated in a decade, it does kind of
[24:43.400 --> 24:49.200]  look dated. And I think this is a nice way to modernize it without being too restrictive,
[24:49.200 --> 24:54.800]  too iOS-y. And maybe the reason why we got these, this flexibility of having three shapes
[24:54.800 --> 24:59.800]  to choose from, which for Apple is flexibility. Wait, I missed that though. Is that actually
[24:59.800 --> 25:03.520]  like the, they're recommending you choose one of those? It's just a recommendation.
[25:03.520 --> 25:05.680]  People are still going to, it's like an iOS. People are still going to do whatever the
[25:05.680 --> 25:08.440]  hell they want with their icons. Right, but they've officially said though that these
[25:08.440 --> 25:11.880]  are the three shapes you should choose from. I didn't know that. And even Apple will be
[25:11.880 --> 25:14.960]  like, are they going to update font book to be looked to have one of the new icons? Like,
[25:14.960 --> 25:18.360]  so there's always some app that doesn't get the nice treatment. I didn't know that. Well,
[25:18.360 --> 25:23.400]  and I think that, I think that's why we got these options because I bet even Apple internally
[25:23.400 --> 25:28.260]  could not decide on any of these shapes to have all of their icons become that shape.
[25:28.260 --> 25:33.520]  So we got choice. The one thing I'm also very excited about is perhaps the sea of blue icons
[25:33.520 --> 25:38.200]  on my dock. At least there'll be like a circular blue icon and a tilted blue icon and then
[25:38.200 --> 25:42.040]  a square blue icon. I think it was an orange now. I think that'll probably be an iTunes
[25:42.040 --> 25:48.320]  is red. I think. Do you think it's safe to say, and we can pull the audience in a second,
[25:48.320 --> 25:54.640]  but do you think it's safe to say that the Yosemite design is far less contentious than
[25:54.640 --> 25:59.160]  iOS seven only because iOS seven came first though, but this came before I was seven would
[25:59.160 --> 26:02.720]  be flipping out because we wouldn't know that the taking borders off the buttons was even
[26:02.720 --> 26:05.580]  an option if iOS seven didn't come around. Now we're like, thank God the buttons have
[26:05.580 --> 26:13.060]  boxes around them. Everything's fine. That's honestly my, I think I texted Dave Whiskas
[26:13.060 --> 26:15.680]  afterwards where we're talking about, you know, how we're going to do Vesper for Mac.
[26:15.680 --> 26:24.320]  And like, I just like all kept it. I was like, uh, buttons look like buttons. Um, I have
[26:24.320 --> 26:30.260]  it, I have a, uh, a review unit or the Apple sort of gave me running, um, 10 eight already.
[26:30.260 --> 26:35.320]  So I've spent a couple hours on it today and you do too. Uh, but you guys haven't really,
[26:35.320 --> 26:38.720]  you, I mean, it's only one day you guys haven't installed it yet. I don't care about the Mac.
[26:38.720 --> 26:43.540]  Only half of us get press passes. You just have a Mac just to open up X code, right?
[26:43.540 --> 26:47.400]  I mean, I haven't sold X code six, which looks good. I played with the playground stuff for
[26:47.400 --> 26:51.960]  Swift and that looks really awesome, but I, the only stuff on Yosemite I've seen is watching
[26:51.960 --> 26:55.640]  over John shoulder as he was fiddling with it earlier today. We're not special enough
[26:55.640 --> 26:59.680]  to get review units. So I, you know, just poking around and going through settings and
[26:59.680 --> 27:07.320]  stuff it I'm surprised, maybe even in a good way, I think in a good way that it's really
[27:07.320 --> 27:13.600]  is mostly a skin deep change. It's really just a new theme and, and very little else
[27:13.600 --> 27:19.320]  has changed. Even little things that I really thought were going to go away, like the, um,
[27:19.320 --> 27:26.000]  blue or graphite highlight color choice thing, which, you know, I know why they did it back
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.800]  in 2001. It was cause everybody flipped out because my God bright blue, you know, I don't
[27:30.800 --> 27:34.480]  like bright blue and they're like, all right, here you go. Here's something dull, which
[27:34.480 --> 27:40.920]  I've been running for 14 years, but that option is still there. Exactly. The wording is unchanged.
[27:40.920 --> 27:44.160]  The, you know, I think what you were, we're all afraid of is that it was going to be like
[27:44.160 --> 27:47.620]  windows eight where like the finder's gone. All it is is a big sidebar that sweeps in
[27:47.620 --> 27:51.840]  from the side that has a grid of icon or launch pad is the new finder or system preferences.
[27:51.840 --> 27:55.720]  Now is a full screen app and the icons are giant. Like it's not, it's just like you said,
[27:55.720 --> 28:01.120]  a recent, then there's an awful lot of apps that to me just look, just, just the theme
[28:01.120 --> 28:04.080]  is different. Everything else is pretty much the same. There's, you know, a lot of apps
[28:04.080 --> 28:09.120]  that are just unchanged. And I, I'm pretty happy about that. And the new look at like
[28:09.120 --> 28:12.120]  when I saw it on the slides, you're like, I'm not sure about it or whatever, but when
[28:12.120 --> 28:15.320]  you see it, when you see it in the element, like, like look in the new Safari, when it's
[28:15.320 --> 28:19.680]  all kind of comes together, you're like, all right, it's coherent. It is all of a piece,
[28:19.680 --> 28:22.880]  whether you like it or not, it doesn't look like something slapped together. You can kind
[28:22.880 --> 28:27.640]  of see a continuous aesthetic on it, which, which is nice. I mean, apps that have not
[28:27.640 --> 28:30.880]  been completely converted. Like if you just take your app that had never knew Yosemite
[28:30.880 --> 28:34.520]  existed and launch it, maybe that'll look odd, but Apple's own apps are leading the
[28:34.520 --> 28:38.160]  way in a reasonable way of saying, this is what they could look like. Check it out. And
[28:38.160 --> 28:41.480]  our, their apps are simple. They have like one title bar, one sidebar and a source list
[28:41.480 --> 28:44.640]  or whatever. Like, I don't know what Photoshop would look like, not that they use native
[28:44.640 --> 28:49.900]  UI, but I mean, and I think when I, when I've seen the screenshots and little demos using
[28:49.900 --> 28:55.920]  it here and there, like the most jarring change to me is the font change, which we were all,
[28:55.920 --> 28:59.760]  you know, like we've been saying, we've been thinking for, for a long time. Oh yeah, well,
[28:59.760 --> 29:02.780]  you're probably going to change the font. It's probably going to be a Helvetica variant
[29:02.780 --> 29:06.000]  or you're going to have to deal with that along with, as they blow up the rest of the
[29:06.000 --> 29:09.820]  interface, you know, and that ends up, that's like, that's like the biggest, most noticeable
[29:09.820 --> 29:15.360]  change most of the time. I also think that it looks, it looks natural on a retina display.
[29:15.360 --> 29:18.960]  Now maybe that's because that's the, the review unit that gave me is a retina MacBook pro.
[29:18.960 --> 29:23.600]  So that's what I've seen it on. But I've never thought that Mac OS X looked quite right on
[29:23.600 --> 29:28.660]  a retina display until now, because it just always looked to me fake, like a fake version
[29:28.660 --> 29:32.840]  of Mac OS X ginned up for a movie. Yeah. It's like when you have an HD version of a movie,
[29:32.840 --> 29:36.500]  you can see the actor's makeup. Right. Yeah. That's what it always looked like to me. It's
[29:36.500 --> 29:40.340]  like, and, and part of it is the font, but lucid, a grand, whatever, you know, however
[29:40.340 --> 29:47.080]  great it was in 2001, 2002 with our big fat pixels on CRT displays back then. And the
[29:47.080 --> 29:52.680]  way that all the hinting helped the strokes fall on the pixel grid. We don't need to worry
[29:52.680 --> 29:57.240]  about that shit anymore. I mean, we've retina displays and nobody at doing 300 DPI print
[29:57.240 --> 30:03.920]  output, whatever use lucid a grand. The thing about the old look was that all of the interest
[30:03.920 --> 30:07.180]  was in the surface details. This looks like it's kind of made out of metal and this looks
[30:07.180 --> 30:10.660]  like it's kind of shiny or whatever. And when you take all that away and they did take it
[30:10.660 --> 30:14.960]  all away with the flatness and everything, the only thing you have left to lean on aesthetically
[30:14.960 --> 30:18.940]  speaking is sharpness. And so this looks great on a red, I think it looks, doesn't look as
[30:18.940 --> 30:23.080]  good on a non readiness, but on a retina display, it's like what we have here is cleanliness
[30:23.080 --> 30:27.160]  sharpness and this theme takes advantage of that. And I think this, this theme would not
[30:27.160 --> 30:31.600]  be as successful if retina didn't exist. Oh, I do. I definitely think so. I don't think,
[30:31.600 --> 30:36.920]  you know, I, no way that this theme would look, and I don't think iOS would either.
[30:36.920 --> 30:41.360]  You know, I don't think there was any world where the iOS seven look would have ever hit
[30:41.360 --> 30:46.840]  before those devices all went red. Except for the poor iPad mini first gen. That's a
[30:46.840 --> 30:51.560]  sad device. That really is. Cause we all bought them cause they were so small and so light
[30:51.560 --> 30:55.920]  and it's, Oh man, the screen. And now that the retina ones exist and you look at that
[30:55.920 --> 30:58.520]  and you're like, first of all, like how long are they going to actually keep supporting
[30:58.520 --> 31:03.760]  the a five? Like, you know, we, we lucked out this year, but it's now the minimum. So
[31:03.760 --> 31:10.140]  I'm thinking it's not getting iOS nine. Apple PR will never, they're all, everybody works
[31:10.140 --> 31:15.960]  there is, you know, a pro and they'll never ever utter even off the record, a single word
[31:15.960 --> 31:19.800]  that is against Apple's interests because they're PR people. That's what they do. And
[31:19.800 --> 31:25.200]  I remember at WWDC last year after the keynote when I got the briefing and they, you know,
[31:25.200 --> 31:28.280]  what do you think about iOS seven? And do you have any questions? I got to ask questions
[31:28.280 --> 31:32.260]  and one of my questions was everything you're showing. This all looks great. I really like
[31:32.260 --> 31:35.480]  it. I think it's a great direction, but every device you're showing it to me on as a retina
[31:35.480 --> 31:40.000]  display, what about the iPad mini? Is it going to get the same look? And they're like, yeah,
[31:40.000 --> 31:45.040]  yeah. And I was like, can I see it? And they were like, not yet. And I was like, is it
[31:45.040 --> 31:52.000]  going to look good? And there was like no answer. It was like, yeah, it looks fine.
[31:52.000 --> 31:55.080]  And then there was like, you know, somebody was there already with like another question
[31:55.080 --> 32:02.560]  like, you know, how's your son? And they're still selling those new, right? Like there's
[32:02.560 --> 32:07.380]  going to be a lot of disappointed retina. I mean, non retina iPad mini owners in about
[32:07.380 --> 32:12.240]  a year, you know, like I hope this fall they at least stopped selling them. And then, you
[32:12.240 --> 32:17.440]  know, next year iOS nines announced no more a five devices. There's a lot of a five devices
[32:17.440 --> 32:24.560]  out there. Yeah, totally. The other, the last big ticket thing is that to me it was the
[32:24.560 --> 32:30.320]  keynote yesterday was a sign of how Apple is playing a very long game in most of these
[32:30.320 --> 32:39.600]  regards. And I think that they've got a years long roadmap and plan. And we only see them
[32:39.600 --> 32:46.200]  on these four month, six month intervals of here's what we have ready for you now. And
[32:46.200 --> 32:50.780]  it's so easy. And I think so many people who misunderstand the company think that in between
[32:50.780 --> 32:55.220]  one and the next, everything they've done is what they've done in between the next that
[32:55.220 --> 32:59.440]  everything they announced today is all the stuff that they've decided to do in the last
[32:59.440 --> 33:04.280]  12 months since last WWDC. And so you see it like you see it like with the keyboards
[33:04.280 --> 33:11.160]  on the third party keyboards for iOS. And there were questions people in the press area
[33:11.160 --> 33:14.600]  after the thing they're asking like, Well, what made you change your mind on these? What
[33:14.600 --> 33:18.880]  what, you know, is it because they're so popular on Android? You know, is it customers are
[33:18.880 --> 33:23.160]  asking for it? And they said, we've been working on this for years, you know, that we really,
[33:23.160 --> 33:26.360]  you know, and you can argue, maybe engineering wise, it shouldn't have taken years, but their
[33:26.360 --> 33:30.160]  explanation is that they've been thinking about it for a long time. I mean, we've been
[33:30.160 --> 33:37.440]  talking about XPC at WWDC for years of inter application communication, and how are they
[33:37.440 --> 33:42.440]  going to do it. And I think that, you know, typical Apple, they wanted to get it right.
[33:42.440 --> 33:45.360]  And that's just a sign of it. People have short memories, though, like, wasn't it last
[33:45.360 --> 33:49.200]  year's WWDC where third party keyboards was like guaranteed a lock for the for the keynote?
[33:49.200 --> 33:54.320]  Remember that rumor? And swipe even published on their site? Yeah, well, I mean, you know,
[33:54.320 --> 33:58.000]  the press, to be fair, you know, the press, usually most of them aren't as smart as you
[33:58.000 --> 34:05.400]  they, most of them, you know, they, we asked them to remember a lot. You know, in this
[34:05.400 --> 34:10.760]  business, we asked them to remember a lot like, can you can you name the whatever phone
[34:10.760 --> 34:17.080]  12 months ago was the iPhone killer that month? That we there's a lot going on in the press.
[34:17.080 --> 34:22.760]  There's a lot of Apple keeps dying and being doomed. And, you know, and and they just they
[34:22.760 --> 34:26.640]  just can't remember simple things like that, you know, products take more than a year to
[34:26.640 --> 34:33.400]  develop. The one thing they announced yesterday that I that it makes me wonder whether they've
[34:33.400 --> 34:42.000]  changed their mind over the last few years is iCloud Drive. Because it, it seemed to
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.120]  me that and maybe that was just the spin at the time before they had the font function.
[34:46.120 --> 34:51.680]  But it seemed to me that there are an awful lot of people who were saying, okay, with
[34:51.680 --> 34:56.440]  the iCloud documents, why can't you build something that is just like Dropbox, right?
[34:56.440 --> 35:00.320]  Long story short, just build a thing that's just like Dropbox, but takes my iCloud credentials.
[35:00.320 --> 35:05.200]  And then it's, you know, it's not like a nasty finder hack. It's built into the system. And
[35:05.200 --> 35:11.620]  their answer was, you know, I don't know, no. I mean, maybe, you know, again, maybe
[35:11.620 --> 35:15.120]  who knows, maybe who even knows who's in the audience, there's some poor guy from Apple
[35:15.120 --> 35:19.520]  in the audience who's been working on iCloud Drive for six years, and you know, nonstop
[35:19.520 --> 35:23.960]  with the original vision that is exactly like what they announced yesterday. But I don't
[35:23.960 --> 35:28.840]  know, it makes me think that maybe they thought they could get away with not having a here's
[35:28.840 --> 35:34.360]  where you're going to save your files experience on iOS. And maybe they've come to conclude
[35:34.360 --> 35:36.840]  that that was wrong or short sighted.
[35:36.840 --> 35:42.320]  Yeah, you know, when I first when I first launched the magazine, I tried not having
[35:42.320 --> 35:47.100]  a settings panel. So I was like, you know, settings panels are a clunky hack. Let me
[35:47.100 --> 35:50.640]  see if I can just get away with not having any settings at all. I'll just make good decisions
[35:50.640 --> 35:54.720]  and all like, you know, surface things contextually. And it turned out that that was a bad idea.
[35:54.720 --> 36:00.320]  It was it required me to do other bad hacks that made the overall product actually worse.
[36:00.320 --> 36:06.000]  And I had to eventually backtrack on that iCloud document model storage and iCloud,
[36:06.000 --> 36:10.480]  you know, file storage, I think had a similar problem where they designed it in with with
[36:10.480 --> 36:15.480]  this goal in mind of let's get rid of files and folders exposed to the user and let's
[36:15.480 --> 36:18.880]  make this thing just sync and it helped the you know, iOS never had the never had that
[36:18.880 --> 36:23.760]  from the start. So let's just give these little silos inside of each app. And they'll have
[36:23.760 --> 36:28.480]  these flat lists of files in that app. And they won't be able to talk to each other.
[36:28.480 --> 36:31.480]  And that'll be fine. That's kind of how iOS works. And then they brought it to Mac. And
[36:31.480 --> 36:35.960]  it was like, well, they're kind of in this hidden folder buried somewhere deeply in the
[36:35.960 --> 36:38.960]  hierarchy that you're not supposed to deal with, but just trust us. It's there somewhere
[36:38.960 --> 36:44.480]  plus you have all these other files somewhere. And I think that proved to be a model that
[36:44.480 --> 36:50.400]  they had this goal in mind of the simplicity, but the the reality of that the practicality
[36:50.400 --> 36:55.440]  of people using that and and you know, multiple app productivity and things just simple things
[36:55.440 --> 37:00.400]  like where are these files so I can back them up? You know, it simple things like that the
[37:00.400 --> 37:05.900]  reality made that idea worse in practice, and they would have had to do a bunch of crazy
[37:05.900 --> 37:11.680]  hacks. They tried to do a bunch of crazy hacks to make it work out. That actually made a
[37:11.680 --> 37:17.240]  worse overall experience. And so I think this is them recognizing you know what, one common
[37:17.240 --> 37:22.960]  place where you store files that behaves like a folder full of other folders. People are
[37:22.960 --> 37:26.800]  okay with that, you know, it's give people a little bit of credit. That folder might
[37:26.800 --> 37:30.560]  not be where you want it to be. It might be their desktop. But people do that they they
[37:30.560 --> 37:35.060]  are okay with having all files live in one place for all applications with these little
[37:35.060 --> 37:39.200]  sub folders, maybe for some application. Like, that's a model that works Dropbox has proven
[37:39.200 --> 37:44.280]  it computers before that proved it. People are okay with that. And I think this is Apple
[37:44.280 --> 37:48.480]  realizing like, if we're going to start breaking down some of these productivity barriers between
[37:48.480 --> 37:52.820]  iOS and Mac and everything like that, and interactive communications of that this is,
[37:52.820 --> 37:56.580]  this will go a long way if we just give up a little bit of our vision about what iCloud
[37:56.580 --> 38:01.060]  was supposed to be. So are you at all nervous john about the fact that they are putting
[38:01.060 --> 38:05.960]  a lot of eggs in the iCloud basket and I know it's almost trendy to bitch and moan about
[38:05.960 --> 38:11.460]  how iCloud doesn't work the way they say it should and so on. But I mean, it it seems
[38:11.460 --> 38:16.300]  to me like they're they're going all in on iCloud and that could be dangerous. Like how
[38:16.300 --> 38:21.820]  do you feel about dangerous how just because we especially as developers, a lot of us don't
[38:21.820 --> 38:27.420]  have any faith in the fact that iCloud is really strong, stable, available, etc. And
[38:27.420 --> 38:33.060]  so now they're now Apple saying no, really, we are all in on iCloud. So you guys are you
[38:33.060 --> 38:36.420]  might as well come along and I didn't go to the cloud kit session today, but I've heard
[38:36.420 --> 38:41.540]  unbelievably positive things about it. So do you have like, how does that make you feel
[38:41.540 --> 38:44.940]  you nervous at all? Are you? No, I think it's I think it's inevitable. I don't think they
[38:44.940 --> 38:49.940]  have a choice. I think that again, I might be reading into this john, you might know
[38:49.940 --> 38:55.900]  because you were actually at the conference all day and not sleeping. But I it seems like
[38:55.900 --> 38:58.820]  they're not doing away with it. Because if you're already using it, they're going to
[38:58.820 --> 39:02.780]  keep counting. But it seems like the thing that they're no longer talking about is iCloud
[39:02.780 --> 39:06.380]  core data syncing. They're still talking about at the end of the end of the cloud kit session
[39:06.380 --> 39:09.980]  they're like, we got all these iCloud things, when should I use each one? Remember them
[39:09.980 --> 39:15.220]  all key value storage and documents in the cloud and iCloud core data and now cloud kit.
[39:15.220 --> 39:17.700]  And they went through them all and said, here's when you should use this. And when they get
[39:17.700 --> 39:22.060]  down to iCloud core data, they're gonna say never, but they didn't. I mean, they put a
[39:22.060 --> 39:25.940]  brave face on it. But cloud kit does a lot of similar things like in a different way
[39:25.940 --> 39:29.140]  to our core data. So I'm not sure they didn't come right out and say we're deprecating the
[39:29.140 --> 39:33.620]  ways that didn't work. And this is the new way but they have they have a suite of things
[39:33.620 --> 39:37.180]  under the umbrella of iCloud and some of them are better than others. And we're all hoping
[39:37.180 --> 39:42.580]  these new ones are the best yet. We'll find out. Right. You know, I think I think they'll
[39:42.580 --> 39:45.540]  make it work. I think because I think that they know, I don't think there's any doubt
[39:45.540 --> 39:49.260]  that they know that they have to do well at it. I think the things you have to worry about
[39:49.260 --> 39:53.540]  with Apple are the things where it seems like they don't. They don't seem to think it's
[39:53.540 --> 39:57.300]  important. Well, they committed to iCloud the first time when Jobs was up there and
[39:57.300 --> 40:00.220]  said oh, it's not only a digital hub. Now the cloud is in the middle of lines come out
[40:00.220 --> 40:03.860]  from that. That seemed like a recommitment to it but then what they offered was like
[40:03.860 --> 40:09.220]  some good, some bad. I'm getting a better vibe from the new stuff because it seems like
[40:09.220 --> 40:13.460]  all the things that you like that worked well about iCloud, these are more like those. Or
[40:13.460 --> 40:17.140]  in the case of CloudKit, this is more like what everyone was doing instead of using iCloud
[40:17.140 --> 40:20.540]  core data. They were forced to do their own thing and they would use, you know, SQLite
[40:20.540 --> 40:25.460]  database with like FC model or FMDB or whatever. This is like that but with an Apple twist
[40:25.460 --> 40:29.340]  and really awesome and everything. And that's actually pretty similar like the what happened
[40:29.340 --> 40:34.100]  between core data plus iCloud and now the new CloudKit. It's actually very similar
[40:34.100 --> 40:37.820]  to what I was just saying about like how like their original view or their original vision
[40:37.820 --> 40:42.580]  of this is how we're going to do iCloud. It's going to have this magical sync. You just
[40:42.580 --> 40:46.740]  keep using core data. Everything's, you keep using it as normal and it just magically syncs.
[40:46.740 --> 40:51.460]  And of course, that wasn't a server problem. That was a design problem. Well, the core
[40:51.460 --> 40:54.000]  data predated iCloud. That was the problem. It's like well, we have this thing called
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.740]  core data. It would be great to put up a slide that says then it works on iCloud and then
[40:57.740 --> 41:01.140]  everything will be fine. Well, that's basically, and they basically, when they announced core
[41:01.140 --> 41:05.940]  data for iCloud, that's what they did. And so, I think CloudKit is them, again, it's
[41:05.940 --> 41:10.340]  like it's similar to how they kind of made iCloud file picking a little more like Dropbox
[41:10.340 --> 41:14.900]  because that's what people actually need. And it's a better overall design in reality.
[41:14.900 --> 41:21.060]  I think CloudKit is solving many of the same needs as iCloud core data but it is a much
[41:21.060 --> 41:26.220]  better design for reality. The one thing and, you know, no surprise. I mean, everybody knows
[41:26.220 --> 41:30.020]  Apple is an ecosystem company and that they want, you know, stuff is supposed to work
[41:30.020 --> 41:33.700]  better. And we don't have time to get into all the continuity stuff but the continuity
[41:33.700 --> 41:40.100]  stuff is an acknowledgement of that. That if you have an iPhone and a Mac, you get this
[41:40.100 --> 41:44.100]  amazing feature that you could not have if you use an Android phone where you can start
[41:44.100 --> 41:49.420]  writing an email and switch to the Mac. And I played with that and I got a demo of it
[41:49.420 --> 41:56.380]  and it works. It's very, very cool. I can definitely see using it. But that they're
[41:56.380 --> 42:00.380]  adding all these other developer things though, I think with the hopes of getting more apps
[42:00.380 --> 42:07.340]  to go Apple only, you know, like I think the idea would be like take an app like Instagram
[42:07.340 --> 42:13.220]  that had enormous server side cost because it's photos and lots of users and they want
[42:13.220 --> 42:19.620]  to be social and they want to get a lot of people to sign up. And I think that iCloud
[42:19.620 --> 42:24.980]  or CloudKit is sort of a, hey, you want to build a thing like Instagram, don't even worry
[42:24.980 --> 42:29.700]  about the server stuff and we'll give you really, really generous amounts of storage
[42:29.700 --> 42:35.420]  and bandwidth. Well, for getting it off the ground, right? And there's a big question
[42:35.420 --> 42:38.540]  mark like they were like, here, it's free and you get all this for free. And then there
[42:38.540 --> 42:42.620]  was no like what happens after that. I think what happens is you get a phone call from
[42:42.620 --> 42:47.580]  Apple and they're like, we need to talk. I'm guessing, though, it's going to be pretty
[42:47.580 --> 42:50.980]  price competitive. That's what I think. Well, it's hard. You know, if you're looking
[42:50.980 --> 42:57.860]  at let's build a business on this, you know, let's talk about Vesper. Right. So the limit
[42:57.860 --> 43:01.580]  that they published is in a public document. So I don't know what the NDA, the NDA situation
[43:01.580 --> 43:06.220]  is weird. It's kind of unspecified. Who knows? But the limit is it's something like a hundred
[43:06.220 --> 43:13.220]  megs per user for like blob storage and then one meg for database storage. Now that those
[43:13.220 --> 43:19.240]  sound low to me, like you couldn't it would be irresponsible for you to design something
[43:19.240 --> 43:25.900]  like Instagram, knowing that as soon as one of those users hit 100 megs of photos, something
[43:25.900 --> 43:30.580]  would stop. And who knows what your options would be at that point, whether you'd even
[43:30.580 --> 43:35.180]  have any options or whether, like the call to CloudKit would just fail with an error
[43:35.180 --> 43:39.980]  parameter. It's it's a lot of stuff that suddenly be outside your control. Right. And that's
[43:39.980 --> 43:44.140]  kind of it's it would be irresponsible to build on that, knowing that like there's this
[43:44.140 --> 43:48.980]  wall that you could very you know, it's not like the limit is five terabytes per user.
[43:48.980 --> 43:54.300]  Like these are these are limits that are very plausibly hit and exceeded. And so, you know,
[43:54.300 --> 43:58.580]  what do you do? Do you just hope no one hits that? That's not very smart. But like John
[43:58.580 --> 44:03.020]  said, though, like if you're going to build any service like this, it's like a network
[44:03.020 --> 44:08.580]  based service that is like a cloud backend. You're going to do it on an Apple only platform.
[44:08.580 --> 44:13.260]  And like maybe I mean, are they the A players in the server side space? And then you're
[44:13.260 --> 44:16.060]  going to like if you start getting big, you're going to be like, oh, we're getting big. We
[44:16.060 --> 44:20.780]  should make an Android version. We should be on the Kindle. We should. Oh, and you can't
[44:20.780 --> 44:23.700]  like you're you're you're putting a cap on your potential. If you ever want to be the
[44:23.700 --> 44:28.340]  next Instagram, don't build on CloudKit. But it's great for people who are not going to
[44:28.340 --> 44:31.740]  be the next Instagram. They just want to have a great application. I mean, again, with Vesper,
[44:31.740 --> 44:35.620]  if you built it on CloudKit, you're going to be an iOS on the Mac. You could use CloudKit.
[44:35.620 --> 44:39.780]  You know, who knows what we would have done a year ago if CloudKit came out a year ago.
[44:39.780 --> 44:42.460]  But I don't think we would have done anything differently. I haven't seen anything that
[44:42.460 --> 44:47.500]  really makes me regret doing our own back end because of that issue. Like, do we have
[44:47.500 --> 44:51.220]  plans to write an Android app? Well, I don't think Brent knows how to write Android apps.
[44:51.220 --> 44:57.120]  And no, Frank can do. But it's a maybe down the road, you know, or web app, right? We
[44:57.120 --> 45:00.420]  could do a web app. We couldn't even do a web app. And we want to have those options
[45:00.420 --> 45:05.980]  and our thinking in broad strokes was, well, we could maybe do something quicker if we
[45:05.980 --> 45:11.320]  build it on Dropbox or, you know, had an option to do Dropbox or had an option to do something
[45:11.320 --> 45:15.900]  with the core data iCloud syncing. And then we'd work on our own thing that we'd roll
[45:15.900 --> 45:21.040]  out. But I think whenever you make an engineering decision like that and you think, well, we'll
[45:21.040 --> 45:25.380]  do this stop gap first because it's quicker and dirtier and easier and we'll ship something
[45:25.380 --> 45:29.680]  first and then we'll do the real good version, then you never do the good version and you're
[45:29.680 --> 45:31.180]  stuck with the crappy one forever.
[45:31.180 --> 45:32.500]  The data migration would kill you anyway.
[45:32.500 --> 45:33.500]  Right.
[45:33.500 --> 45:34.500]  You would never want to do the good version.
[45:34.500 --> 45:38.380]  So if we wanted to do it eventually, then we should have done it first. And I think
[45:38.380 --> 45:42.940]  that we did it the right way. I think SpriteKit is the same sort of idea. The idea was SpriteKit
[45:42.940 --> 45:48.020]  and it's a good one. It's not all about lock-in. It's not purely cynical. Hey, write your
[45:48.020 --> 45:52.340]  game with SpriteKit and you'll save all this work but then you'll be stuck with an iOS
[45:52.340 --> 45:58.320]  only game. I think it's, you know, from Apple's perspective, it's win-win. That's what Cocoa
[45:58.320 --> 46:05.940]  and Cocoa Touch have done for close to 30 years is take TDM away from programmers and
[46:05.940 --> 46:11.080]  do a really good framework that you can count on. But I wonder, I don't know like what the
[46:11.080 --> 46:17.420]  uptake is on SpriteKit because it just seems to me like most major effort mobile games
[46:17.420 --> 46:21.700]  more than any other kind of app because of the nature of games want to be cross-platform
[46:21.700 --> 46:25.380]  or want to be cross-platform eventually. And so I just don't know if SpriteKit is ever
[46:25.380 --> 46:27.700]  going to really take off.
[46:27.700 --> 46:32.380]  So I think we're looking at this from the point of view of, I mean, I'm looking at like
[46:32.380 --> 46:35.700]  something like CloudKit and saying, all right, well, from the point of view of wanting to
[46:35.700 --> 46:42.260]  design a really big web service that has going to have, you know, the six-year lifespan or
[46:42.260 --> 46:48.300]  more than that maybe and, you know, possibly get to a billion dollar valuation somehow
[46:48.300 --> 46:53.780]  like that's, yeah, it might not be good for that but there's a massive class of problems
[46:53.780 --> 46:58.220]  that these kind of frameworks solve that are on a much smaller scale. Like most developers
[46:58.220 --> 47:03.020]  are not working on things like that. Most developers are working on much smaller apps
[47:03.020 --> 47:09.060]  that like if the alternative is no backend then CloudKit is really nice because it's
[47:09.060 --> 47:14.320]  a backend you can use for limited value or for limited purposes but that's enough for
[47:14.320 --> 47:15.800]  tons of applications.
[47:15.800 --> 47:21.600]  SpriteKit very similar like, yeah, you're not going to make the next, you know, Rovio
[47:21.600 --> 47:24.780]  company on that because you're not going to be able to address all these other platforms
[47:24.780 --> 47:27.980]  without hiring people to rewrite the engine for all of them and eventually convert it
[47:27.980 --> 47:33.940]  to OpenGL or whatever but that's not what it's made to solve. It's made to solve much
[47:33.940 --> 47:39.740]  smaller needs for a far larger number of developers and, you know, once you exceed those limits
[47:39.740 --> 47:42.700]  for one of these things then you're probably big enough that you can't afford to migrate.
[47:42.700 --> 47:46.580]  Yeah, so for those of you who have listened to ATP, I've talked on and off about how I
[47:46.580 --> 47:51.040]  really just want a really solid app to share a grocery list with my wife and Reminders
[47:51.040 --> 47:55.640]  will do it but it's crummy and there's other apps out there and for me if I wanted to write
[47:55.640 --> 48:00.300]  something I don't want to have to worry about VPSs, I don't want to have to worry about
[48:00.300 --> 48:04.620]  a lot of other things and so something like CloudKit is perfect for this app that I want
[48:04.620 --> 48:08.580]  to write really to scratch my own itch and, you know, if I make a few bucks off of it,
[48:08.580 --> 48:12.700]  sweet, but I'm never going to be a Vesper, I'm never going to be an Instapaper, an Overcast
[48:12.700 --> 48:14.540]  or anything like that and that's okay with you.
[48:14.540 --> 48:15.540]  Don't say that.
[48:15.540 --> 48:16.540]  Yeah, you never know.
[48:16.540 --> 48:17.540]  You never know, man.
[48:17.540 --> 48:18.540]  You never know.
[48:18.540 --> 48:19.540]  Come on, have some confidence.
[48:19.540 --> 48:23.060]  We're going to be on shipping app once we Overcast.
[48:23.060 --> 48:24.060]  That's true.
[48:24.060 --> 48:25.060]  That is very true.
[48:25.060 --> 48:33.660]  All right, one last topic on the nerd path because I think it's very telling about where
[48:33.660 --> 48:39.940]  Apple is today in a keynote, especially a WWDC keynote because the event ones are more
[48:39.940 --> 48:43.900]  focused because it's, hey, we've just got this new iPad we want to show you but WWDC,
[48:43.900 --> 48:49.220]  you can see what Apple thinks is important based on what kind of stint it gets on stage,
[48:49.220 --> 48:50.220]  right?
[48:50.220 --> 48:53.260]  There's the basic level of, oh, yeah, there's this thing and it'll just tell you and it'll
[48:53.260 --> 48:57.500]  put up a slide and a thing and then it's on to the next topic.
[48:57.500 --> 49:01.940]  Then there's like bring out a special guest and bring out like, you know, that's like
[49:01.940 --> 49:06.180]  at the far end is like bring out like a third party and say we brought them here a month
[49:06.180 --> 49:10.960]  ago, we tied them up in a room and made them write this thing and the one that got that,
[49:10.960 --> 49:17.940]  the only third party that came on stage yesterday was Epic and that was for metal and, yeah,
[49:17.940 --> 49:23.980]  that's really, you know, it goes against the idea that they were focusing on the consumer
[49:23.980 --> 49:24.980]  stuff, right?
[49:24.980 --> 49:29.740]  Metal and it's a replacement for OpenGL and blah, blah, blah, you know, millions of triangles
[49:29.740 --> 49:35.380]  per second but Apple clearly sees it as important because they spent a lot of time on it and
[49:35.380 --> 49:42.060]  had a big demo and I think it's so interesting about where Apple is as a company today because
[49:42.060 --> 49:46.580]  it's not just that they've replaced OpenGL, it's that they've gotten out of now the headache
[49:46.580 --> 49:52.900]  of OpenGL is like a, it's open, it's got like a consortium behind it and so if they want
[49:52.900 --> 49:58.140]  to get improvements to OpenGL so that it runs better on an A7, they've got to go through
[49:58.140 --> 50:02.260]  this process and now fuck all that, right?
[50:02.260 --> 50:03.260]  Like WebKit.
[50:03.260 --> 50:09.900]  Metal is exactly what Apple wants for talking to the GPUs that they've designed.
[50:09.900 --> 50:16.300]  It's like now they've got an API for using the GPUs that was designed hand in hand with
[50:16.300 --> 50:22.300]  the hardware guys who were making the GPUs and that is not something Apple ten years
[50:22.300 --> 50:24.500]  ago could have done because Apple wasn't big enough.
[50:24.500 --> 50:30.320]  Microsoft could do it and they did it with DirectX and Microsoft could get away with
[50:30.320 --> 50:35.700]  it because there were, you know, three, four hundred million PCs out in the world and a
[50:35.700 --> 50:39.440]  hundred million of them were people who wanted to play games and so Microsoft could say we've
[50:39.440 --> 50:47.020]  got DirectX, you're going to program to DirectX and game developers said yes.
[50:47.020 --> 50:50.100]  DirectX had the advantage of learning from all of OpenGL's mistakes because OpenGL was
[50:50.100 --> 50:55.020]  older so it is a little bit newer and DirectX, Apple, Microsoft has evolved it and it is
[50:55.020 --> 50:59.420]  a very capable API but I think on the Metal front a lot of that I think was coming from
[50:59.420 --> 51:03.860]  game developers who were saying you've got a great GPU but you're making us use OpenGL
[51:03.860 --> 51:08.340]  ES and here's where it's stupid and like you said Apple's like well we don't make OpenGL,
[51:08.340 --> 51:11.340]  we don't define the standard, we work with the consortium and it's like trying to work
[51:11.340 --> 51:15.540]  with W3C, it's a slow process and so game developers are like well what about now, my
[51:15.540 --> 51:20.300]  shipping game now I want to, you know, I want to get closer to the Metal and so they pulled
[51:20.300 --> 51:24.820]  the name right out and you know it's like AMD's mantle like it's game developers wanted
[51:24.820 --> 51:28.260]  this, a game developer and what can Apple do, Apple can't, they're not going to go off
[51:28.260 --> 51:31.500]  and make their own DirectX because that's like no that's not what we want, we know exactly
[51:31.500 --> 51:34.460]  what we want, we know what the GPU is capable of, just give us more control.
[51:34.460 --> 51:38.060]  So it's one of the rare cases where Apple enters a new API that's lower level and that
[51:38.060 --> 51:40.900]  it's because developers wanted it, they said we want lower level.
[51:40.900 --> 51:44.780]  Well and then I think the other way that it'll work and it'll get uptake is that they've
[51:44.780 --> 51:48.580]  clearly, this is one of those things where they were a little open, slightly with a short
[51:48.580 --> 51:54.820]  list but they had Epic, they've got like I think the four big game engines on board already
[51:54.820 --> 51:59.580]  and so it's the game engines that provide the higher level API that most game developers
[51:59.580 --> 52:05.640]  spend most of their time in and they just get to take advantage of this 10x improvement.
[52:05.640 --> 52:09.340]  But I know, I know the guy even said like an order of magnitude improvement but I don't
[52:09.340 --> 52:13.260]  think people, maybe some people don't really think that that could be true that like year
[52:13.260 --> 52:16.780]  over year there's a 10x improvement in graphics but it's really that true.
[52:16.780 --> 52:21.000]  Well I mean it's specific cases like OpenGL API, they want you to like batch up your stuff
[52:21.000 --> 52:24.200]  and not do a bunch of different calls but just gather up all your crap and make one
[52:24.200 --> 52:28.000]  call because doing the calls is expensive and this is saying well I got a 10x speed
[52:28.000 --> 52:31.020]  up because I don't have to do that anymore, I don't have to do this careful batching and
[52:31.020 --> 52:34.300]  trying to play nice with OpenGL, I can just send the calls and I mean I don't know enough
[52:34.300 --> 52:38.100]  of the details of it but it's like it is a kind of a tailor-picked benchmark like oh
[52:38.100 --> 52:41.620]  10x in this particular operation but that particular operation happens all the time
[52:41.620 --> 52:44.540]  and you could work around it the old way but it was annoying and they said geez just let
[52:44.540 --> 52:47.580]  me talk to the GPU the way it wants me to talk to it, I don't have to deal with this
[52:47.580 --> 52:48.580]  stuff.
[52:48.580 --> 52:56.100]  All right, whatever, now let's take a break.
[52:56.100 --> 52:59.420]  I want to end up the nerdy part of the show, I think that was pretty good but I have a
[52:59.420 --> 53:06.380]  surprise and I have a surprise guest from our friends at Apple and I know it was in
[53:06.380 --> 53:16.620]  the news last week, no even better, I have a gift for you Marco and it's here from Dr.
[53:16.620 --> 53:23.700]  Dre, ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre.
[53:23.700 --> 53:33.580]  I read your site, I listen to your podcast, I know that you love high-end headphones.
[53:33.580 --> 53:37.460]  You can go ahead and open that, I'll hold this, I think it would be fair for you to
[53:37.460 --> 53:38.460]  throw those on real quick.
[53:38.460 --> 53:43.180]  Is this real?
[53:43.180 --> 53:47.100]  So I had Dre, I called Dre and you know he takes phone calls, he answered right on his
[53:47.100 --> 53:53.680]  Mac and I said Dre, I need the best headphones in the world because this guy is really fucking
[53:53.680 --> 53:54.680]  picky.
[53:54.680 --> 53:57.860]  I sent him the URL of his headphone comparison and he's like holy shit man, that guy really
[53:57.860 --> 54:02.780]  knows his shit, I got just the phones for him, Beats studio special edition.
[54:02.780 --> 54:06.180]  The funny thing is actually, I was in an Apple store recently and I tried these on and I
[54:06.180 --> 54:10.980]  thought you know actually of all the Beats, these actually don't sound that bad.
[54:10.980 --> 54:16.700]  I was like of all the ones here, if I had to buy a pair of Beats, the studios are actually
[54:16.700 --> 54:20.060]  the least crappy sounding ones that they make.
[54:20.060 --> 54:22.540]  Way to ruin the bit.
[54:22.540 --> 54:24.420]  And their overcast theme too.
[54:24.420 --> 54:25.420]  Totally.
[54:25.420 --> 54:26.420]  Yeah.
[54:26.420 --> 54:28.420]  Top secret, my color is orange.
[54:28.420 --> 54:32.120]  I want to take a moment here, we have one more sponsor for the episode who I want to
[54:32.120 --> 54:36.100]  thank and that is our good friends at Market Circle.
[54:36.100 --> 54:39.780]  Market Circle has two great apps, you've probably heard of them both because they've sponsored
[54:39.780 --> 54:44.700]  my show before, they've sponsored the site, but they have Billings Pro, now that's a time
[54:44.700 --> 54:48.460]  tracking and invoicing app, so anybody who does freelance work where you have to track
[54:48.460 --> 54:51.960]  your time, send invoices, if you haven't looked at Billings Pro, you're nuts.
[54:51.960 --> 54:58.980]  It's a great app, they've got clients for all your devices, and when you make your invoice,
[54:58.980 --> 55:02.420]  they've got templates and themes and they come out looking great, so it's not like some
[55:02.420 --> 55:08.320]  kind of ugly thing where it looks like a 1978 Vax printed out your invoice, really really
[55:08.320 --> 55:11.060]  top notch design, great stuff.
[55:11.060 --> 55:18.020]  And Daylight, Daylight is software for organizing your business, the way they describe it is,
[55:18.020 --> 55:22.820]  it's CRM with productivity features first as opposed to the other way around, so you
[55:22.820 --> 55:26.900]  can actually organize the people who are involved and the people you know in your company in
[55:26.900 --> 55:34.900]  a way that looks like a real nice Mac or iOS app, not some piece of crap, typical CRM stuff.
[55:34.900 --> 55:38.580]  So Market Circle, you can go to marketcircle.com and check out their great stuff, but they
[55:38.580 --> 55:40.860]  help sponsor this show and that's great.
[55:40.860 --> 55:43.880]  And the other thing I wanted to do is I wanted to mention this, so AJ is the guy from Market
[55:43.880 --> 55:50.640]  Circle and he's been a long time fan of the show and he, a couple weeks ago, I got a nice
[55:50.640 --> 55:58.300]  email from somebody at iTunes about the explicit tag on this podcast and the fact that it wasn't
[55:58.300 --> 56:03.340]  there and it was just, hey, we all love your show, it was very nice, very personal, and
[56:03.340 --> 56:07.540]  we know there's not a lot of swearing on your show, but it does come up occasionally and
[56:07.540 --> 56:12.400]  we've started to get some complaints from parents.
[56:12.400 --> 56:15.460]  And so I've started, you know, if you look at the feed, there's like at least two episodes
[56:15.460 --> 56:20.060]  from the last three or four that have the explicit tag because they're swearing, obviously
[56:20.060 --> 56:22.700]  this show is probably going to have to have the explicit tag.
[56:22.700 --> 56:28.580]  And that very day, I got an email and it just said, subject, my son and the talk show, and
[56:28.580 --> 56:31.500]  I thought, oh God, here it is.
[56:31.500 --> 56:34.660]  And I almost didn't even read it, I don't want to read this, and I clicked it and read
[56:34.660 --> 56:35.660]  it.
[56:35.660 --> 56:39.620]  And instead it was AJ writing me and he just said he's a 10-year-old son and he's a huge
[56:39.620 --> 56:40.620]  fan of the show.
[56:40.620 --> 56:44.420]  And I was like, wow, 10 years old, my son does not want to listen to me talk about any
[56:44.420 --> 56:45.420]  of this stuff.
[56:45.420 --> 56:46.420]  That's amazing.
[56:46.420 --> 56:47.420]  10 years old.
[56:47.420 --> 56:52.000]  And he loves the talk show and it's the only show he likes to, sorry guys, the only show
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.260]  he likes to listen to.
[56:54.260 --> 56:57.520]  And so AJ said that he'll listen to the talk show because he's been a longtime listener
[56:57.520 --> 57:01.420]  and then he's like driving his son to school or soccer practice or something and he's like,
[57:01.420 --> 57:04.020]  he wants to listen to the talk show and he's got to listen to the episodes again because
[57:04.020 --> 57:06.580]  he's already listened to them and his son wants to listen to them.
[57:06.580 --> 57:11.860]  Anyway, his son plays soccer and a week or so ago he was playing and he got injured,
[57:11.860 --> 57:16.820]  he got a concussion and he's been laid up since, can't play soccer, can't even listen,
[57:16.820 --> 57:19.260]  he's got like headaches, can't even listen to podcasts.
[57:19.260 --> 57:25.180]  So his son's name is Kayden and I just wanted to say something to him right here on the
[57:25.180 --> 57:28.460]  show because whenever he's better from this concussion he's going to listen to it.
[57:28.460 --> 57:33.380]  And I hope it's a nice thrill, but let's, everybody here in the show, let's hear it
[57:33.380 --> 57:39.860]  for Kayden, the 10 year old fan of the talk show.
[57:39.860 --> 57:49.340]  All right, you lose your mic Casey.
[57:49.340 --> 57:50.340]  All right.
[57:50.340 --> 57:55.180]  My next guest is my good friend, Mr. Scott Simpson.
[57:55.180 --> 58:11.300]  I came in like a wrecking ball, I never hit so hard, all I wanted was to break your walls,
[58:11.300 --> 58:27.140]  all you ever did was wreck me, I came in like a wrecking ball, yeah I just closed my eyes
[58:27.140 --> 58:41.660]  all you ever did was wreck me, yeah you, you wreck me, yeah you, you wreck me.
[58:41.660 --> 58:48.220]  What's up San Francisco, the talk show worldwide developer something something, means clap
[58:48.220 --> 58:49.220]  your hands.
[58:49.220 --> 58:54.060]  I feel like the show, I realized when I was backstage waiting to go up, the show is going
[58:54.060 --> 59:02.180]  to be a mullet, this business is over, now it's party.
[59:02.180 --> 59:10.260]  Hi, my name is Scott Simpson, I worked at Apple for about eight years and then I left
[59:10.260 --> 59:20.020]  to do stand-up comedy about a year and a half ago, for the money, just know that Marco is
[59:20.020 --> 59:22.700]  looking at my butt right now.
[59:22.700 --> 59:28.540]  It's right there, I mean.
[59:28.540 --> 59:33.060]  And it's been going well and and if you don't know who I am, that's fine, I assume you're
[59:33.060 --> 59:39.180]  a cretin or some type of hill person, that's fine though and I was talking to a friend
[59:39.180 --> 59:43.860]  of mine like, hey how can I get my name out there more as a comedian now that I'm doing
[59:43.860 --> 59:50.860]  comedy and he was like, well what's your theme song and I was like, what do you mean theme
[59:50.860 --> 59:54.540]  song, he's like, dude you gotta have a theme song, I was like, I don't have a theme song,
[59:54.540 --> 59:59.780]  he's like, if you have a theme song, then people remember it, they know it's you, it
[59:59.780 --> 01:00:06.580]  sounded like a great idea, so I sat down with my guitar in my office and I knocked out a
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:12.100]  little theme song, do you guys want to hear it, all right, let's listen to my, the theme
[01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:38.940]  song that I wrote for myself.
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:01:05.380]  That's my theme song, thank you, thank you.
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:12.060]  It was really fun to work with Lil Jon on that, my friend Jessie Char has a great idea
[01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:16.560]  about Lil Jon, she's like, you know what, 2014, we have exactly the right amount of
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:21.140]  Lil Jon, like Lil Jon's not food, Lil Jon's like a spice, you don't want too much Lil
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:25.340]  Jon, you just want a lil Lil Jon.
[01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:30.180]  I took that back to my people and they were like, you know what, that's great, but it's
[01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:36.380]  a little, maybe a little edgy for your, for your crowd, so I went back to the drawing
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:59.060]  board and I tried, I tried another, tried another route, so let's hear that next one.
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:02.900]  Then they were like, well, it skews a little young, like it's a little poppy, and maybe
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:07.820]  that's not your style, try something a little, a little more classic, a little older, so
[01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:25.660]  I went back to the drawing board, Scott, I agree, I agree with you guys, that one sucks.
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:43.020]  So that one was too old, so I tried like another tack, Scott, and they were like, the voice
[01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:49.340]  is good, and I was, I was into it, cause like, I thought I sounded really good on that track,
[01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:53.700]  so they were like, try that same voice, and it's like some setting in GarageBand, try
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:03:17.700]  that voice, but try it like a little more rocky, Scott, I realize now that I made too
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:26.600]  many of these, but we're still gonna do them, and then, you know, we realized like it does
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:31.720]  need to be a little more current, a little more, a little more interesting and fun, maybe
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:37.020]  bring it up a little bit in terms of energy, so let's give this one a listen.
[01:03:37.020 --> 01:04:01.180]  Mix-A-Lot and I agreed that the messaging on that was a little weird, so we got to this,
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:23.260]  let's listen to this next one.
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:39.140]  Are you as bored of this joke as I am?
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:54.540]  Swing me, motherfucker, get the fuck out of here, alright, just one more, Scott, Scott,
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:05:07.260]  yeah, I'm gonna go with Turn Down for Scott, I feel like that's the best one, I'm gonna
[01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:13.220]  live with that, thank you.
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:16.940]  It is very nice to be in San Francisco, I live here, I know a lot of you folks traveled
[01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:24.380]  here from elsewhere, over the weekend, I want to tell you this brief story, I went to Indiana
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:29.740]  to perform in a comedy festival there, and when I was there, before I went, my friend
[01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:39.660]  was like, are you going to Bloomington, Bloomington's fun, but watch out, they like to drink, and
[01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:50.820]  I was like, that's also how people introduce me, watch out, he likes to drink, so I took
[01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:54.460]  it as a challenge, I think I won, I might have lost, I'm not sure, I got drunk the whole
[01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:59.660]  time, it was great, but a couple other amazing things happened to me when I was in Indiana,
[01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:05.220]  is anybody here from Indiana, clap if you're from Indiana, alright, that's a decent number,
[01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:13.040]  here's what I thought about Indiana before I went, as I was driving from Indianapolis
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:22.940]  in the airport, I was driving on the highway, it was so beautiful, as I drove, a majestic
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:31.580]  water bird, like a heron or a crane, a four foot wingspan came and flew next to my car,
[01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:37.260]  for about a minute, it just flew there next to my car, and I swear to god at one point,
[01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:45.120]  it looked over at me and was like, I'm pretty sure I got supped by a heron, it was awesome,
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:50.060]  it was like that moment in Easy Rider when somebody does something to a thing, whatever,
[01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:56.380]  doesn't matter, but I was riding along with this god damn heron and it was beautiful,
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:07:01.340]  now we have to use the explicit tag, I'm sorry, I'm sorry Kayden, Kayden, man I know you're
[01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:08.580]  not gonna listen to this, but you're gonna get so much puss based on that, that applause,
[01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:23.620]  oh bro, fucking Kayden, can we sub in Scott for that later, it's kind of my thing, Scott's
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:31.900]  ten, he had a concussion, and he's ready to fuck, that's not true, I'm not, I'm sorry,
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:39.740]  so back to Indiana, there I was in Indiana, and this majestic bird was flying next to
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:46.940]  me, and then at one moment it arced off, and I saw it fly over a large warehouse, and on
[01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:53.300]  the side of the warehouse was a bed sheet, and on the bed sheet was hand painted the
[01:07:53.300 --> 01:08:04.300]  word fireworks, as I left the fireworks store with a bag full of way more shit than I can
[01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:10.700]  use in three days, I thought to myself, this is amazing, this is two amazing human achievements,
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:17.020]  two amazing human perceptions in one day, I got to view, I got to see the majesty of
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:24.620]  nature, and I also got to experience the majesty of using some shit to blow other shit up,
[01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:29.140]  right, it's great, like, I feel like that is core to us as people, whether you believe
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:37.860]  in God or not, you recognize that the world is a magical, wonderful place, and sometimes
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:44.380]  you want to make it fucking explode.
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:50.580]  The rest of the weekend I spent in my hotel room listening to Lionel Richie just sitting
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:59.180]  on a pile of fireworks, not dancing on the ceiling, hello, I listened to hello on repeat
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:06.300]  in my underwear, surrounded by bottle rockets and Roman candles, and I thought to myself,
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:11.260]  God damn it, Heartland, there are some things you do right, like I'm a California guy, I'm
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:16.540]  as blue state as they come, but I loved being in Indiana, because you know what, if a dumb,
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:21.180]  meaty bro wants to ride around on his motorcycle with his helmet off, that's kind of great,
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:26.900]  right, like, I feel like we can learn from, I can learn, certainly, from that perspective,
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:35.860]  like certainly I believe that a woman has a right to a legal and safe abortion.
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:39.140]  Thank you, I think if you believe in it, why don't we clap for that, if you believe in
[01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:42.740]  it.
[01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:46.980]  I believe in that, I also want to clap for this next one, I also believe that that same
[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:54.060]  woman has a legal, unsafe right to enough fireworks to freak out all the cats in her
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:10:00.500]  neighborhood, right, like both of those things, that's great, and what I was going to say
[01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:06.380]  based on that was, you know, I think the same thing sort of applies a lot of times in technology,
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:13.580]  like there's a partisanship between two opposing sides, like iOS versus Android or something
[01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:19.340]  like that, and we really gain a lot when we come together and figure stuff out that works
[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:23.260]  on both sides, I was going to say that, that's boring as fuck, I just want to talk about
[01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:32.500]  being in my underwear in my hotel room.
[01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:36.380]  Turn down for me you guys.
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:43.220]  The other thing that I wanted to talk about with you guys specifically, Mark, no nothing,
[01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:52.580]  it's cool, you got those sweet beats, I'm going to call you sweet beats from now on.
[01:10:52.580 --> 01:11:01.500]  Have you guys ever heard of a place called Draper University, no, has anybody here ever
[01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.260]  heard of Draper University?
[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.260]  A few people?
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:11.980]  Okay, okay, you might not like the next half an hour of what we talk about, oh, thank you
[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:14.620]  guys, thank you so much.
[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:31.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, Brent Simmons and Choc, woo, and Booze, and Booze, clap for Booze,
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:40.060]  and Jessie Char, so I do a lot of stuff in San Mateo, I spend a lot of time at the public
[01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:49.300]  library in San Mateo because they have the most relaxed sleeping policy, and I've often
[01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:55.340]  walked by this place that is an old converted hotel, and I walked past the other day and
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:12:03.700]  in the window were two giant photographs, one of Steve Jobs and one of Elon Musk, looking
[01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:09.420]  like he needs some sun, like he always does, and I was like, what is this place?
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:13.880]  So I did some research online to find out what Draper University is, and I thought I'd
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:19.540]  share it with you, mostly because I feel like as good, we're all good people, right, like
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:26.440]  I feel like we should combat the douchiness in our midst, and technology often encourages
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:29.900]  a lot of that behavior.
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:31.540]  It's rampant out in the valley.
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:35.500]  Yeah, oh yeah, exactly, and so that's where this is.
[01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:42.940]  So I looked it up online, Draper University, and I got this information.
[01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:51.380]  Located in Silicon Valley, Draper University of Heroes, it's the first sign, like it's
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:56.700]  Draper University of Heroes, and then I remembered like a bunch of like young people walking
[01:12:56.700 --> 01:13:01.360]  around town wearing this t-shirt that just says hero on it, I'm like, what did you, did
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.460]  you save a cat from a burning building?
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:08.260]  You don't look like it, and I realized that they're attendees of Draper University.
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:13.660]  Draper University of Heroes is the brainchild of free-spirited venture capitalist Tim Draper,
[01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:19.060]  aka the risk master.
[01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:25.060]  I think Tim Draper is a good stand-in for a Silicon Valley proto-douche, like a, like
[01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:31.020]  the last generation, like, you know, like he's got like a fun tie, and he hates all
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:39.040]  taxes.
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:42.940]  I thought when you said it, I never heard of it, I thought it was maybe like a Don Draper
[01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:48.300]  University, and I, I feel like anybody who would enroll at thinking along the lines that
[01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:52.340]  I'm thinking is probably going to be very disappointed when the classes start, like
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:55.740]  they probably think classes are going to start like this.
[01:13:55.740 --> 01:14:00.620]  That's right, that's right, we do a shot, and then we learn how to harass, right?
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:03.020]  You unlearn all those classes you took.
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:05.780]  Apparently it's a very different university.
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:06.780]  It is.
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:13.300]  So, what they say on their website, top of the line website, it's not, it's terrible.
[01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:17.500]  We are an unconventional world-class residential and online school for the brightest young
[01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:20.180]  entrepreneurs from around the world.
[01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:26.240]  Our core curriculum, alright, our core curriculum includes some of the following topics.
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:33.800]  Media training, negotiations, various topics in finance, they just gloss over the stuff
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:39.060]  that's actually a school subject.
[01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:45.820]  And then they dive into other things like lean startups, creativity crash course, design
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:51.620]  thinking, innovation, and some other terrible stuff.
[01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:56.620]  And so, I was like, what is it, so I looked further, I watched a video, there's a great
[01:14:56.620 --> 01:15:00.060]  video online about Draper University.
[01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:06.060]  Instead of desks, students sit in colorful bean bag chairs.
[01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:09.940]  And the video is great because, like, obviously he had this idea, he's like, oh, this will
[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:14.420]  be great, we'll be unconventional as fuck, we'll just sit in bean bag chairs and bandy
[01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:16.680]  about great ideas for how to change the world.
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:23.420]  And you see the kids in the bean bag chairs and they're, like, sliding down.
[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:25.100]  Did you have a bean bag chair when you were growing up?
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:30.040]  No, I wanted one, but I was not allowed to have one because I was told before we ever
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:34.800]  even tried it that it would break and make a ginormous mess.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.820]  You had good parents.
[01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:40.880]  Yeah, that's, like, the bean bag chair is the great lie, it's like the hungry, hungry
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:41.880]  hippos of chairs.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:44.520]  Like, it seems like it's going to be the best thing in the world.
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:50.700]  And then you get it and somebody swallows a marble and you're in the emergency room.
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:55.820]  Every common area and hallway is covered in whiteboard paint for brainstorming.
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:59.800]  And there's a shot of the class schedule at one point.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:05.460]  One of the classes is called Futurology.
[01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:08.700]  It's making up words.
[01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:14.000]  And then there's a quote from an article about the university.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:19.220]  Earlier that day I watched Draper change the agenda line for a planned activity, a gathering
[01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:22.700]  of Draper U students and his daughter's college friends.
[01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:32.360]  He changed it from mixer with sorority to hero-a-thon.
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:39.480]  The private school is not accredited.
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:45.160]  And never will be, Draper says, that's a box we don't want to be put into.
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:52.380]  Oh, the actual university box.
[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:54.720]  So here's my favorite part.
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:57.600]  And then I have a question for you guys.
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:05.400]  At the end of the session, each student doesn't receive a BA or a BS or, again, an actual
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:06.400]  degree.
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:13.880]  Each student receives a CA, which stands for, can you guess what CA stands for?
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:14.880]  Creative achievement.
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.440]  Creative achievement.
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.600]  That's a terrible guess, John.
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.960]  It's actually a fine guess.
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:26.240]  It stands for change agent.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:30.960]  Which sounds like what Ebola turns into when it's human catchable.
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:34.080]  We could have given John six months and he never would have thought of that because it's
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:35.080]  such bullshit.
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.080]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.080]  That's right.
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.080]  You just proved yourself to be bullshit-free.
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:43.000]  All right.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  So here's my favorite part.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:57.280]  In lieu of diplomas, Draper U students receive masks and superhero capes printed, guy up
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:02.040]  front said, no.
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:09.480]  They receive masks and capes printed with their superhero nicknames, gets better.
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:14.640]  And are instructed to jump on each of a series of three small trampolines placed in a line
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:17.500]  in front of them.
[01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:26.600]  While bouncing from trampoline to trampoline, they're told to shout, up, up and away.
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.280]  Then they assemble for a group photo.
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:30.400]  What a bullshit place.
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:35.240]  So why are we doing this show instead of doing a show where all of us go there and videotape
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:36.240]  it?
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:37.240]  That would be great.
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:46.640]  I also thought maybe we could do a Kickstarter where we all send John to.
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:48.840]  So again, it's called a university.
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:51.580]  It's an eight-week course.
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:56.520]  So it's an eight-week course that costs $10,000, which frankly is not that crazy for, I mean,
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:01.800]  you get breakfast.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:06.720]  I thought maybe we could, because actually the application deadline, this is true, the
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:10.080]  application deadline for the summer quarter, I think they call it, even though that's a
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:13.480]  lie, is tomorrow.
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:17.840]  On the application screen, it's an online application.
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:24.320]  There's one box that just says, tell us a story.
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:25.320]  Which I love.
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:31.200]  But then I realized that you have to be 18 to 26 to go there.
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:38.120]  And I don't think, like we could doctor no the fuck out of you with some makeup, but
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:44.340]  I don't think there'd be enough to make you look 26.
[01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:51.840]  But then that got me thinking too, look, Draper U, let's just work to combat that element
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:57.120]  of bullshit tech speak and entrepreneurial mumble jumbo.
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:01.640]  Mumble jumbo, I just said.
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:06.160]  But I thought maybe, well, here's my dream.
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:16.160]  My dream is this, not Draper U, my dream is Gruber U. Gruber University.
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:20.280]  I don't know, not of heroes.
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:21.800]  But I don't know what that would look like.
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:24.200]  I thought maybe you guys could help me out with that.
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:26.800]  I think John already told you, it's like Mad Men University.
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:27.880]  That's true.
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:33.920]  It's still called Draper University.
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:38.360]  So there's a lot of drinking, there's no suits though.
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:40.000]  Morning classes, no.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.520]  No morning classes.
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:45.960]  You'll have classes, you'll have classes at two in the morning.
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.920]  That doesn't count as a morning.
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:50.320]  Well, that's a good question.
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.840]  I don't know, I feel like I'm in a poor position to judge.
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:57.480]  I feel like it's, I feel like you guys maybe would have better ideas than me.
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:01.920]  Well, is the curriculum anything outside of mixology?
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:04.600]  Is that pretty much the extent of it all?
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:07.040]  No, I have other interests.
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.920]  I mean, it'd be a wide-ranging curriculum.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:13.920]  But they all just fund, we'd have a very good baseball team.
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:14.920]  That's true.
[01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:15.920]  That's right.
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:16.920]  But you went to school and you did like the student things.
[01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.560]  You were in that school newspaper.
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:19.560]  You did all that studying.
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:22.560]  So the Draper University, and Draper, sorry, the Gruber University has got to take you
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:27.400]  through that arc of like, once he was a good student and belonged to the newspaper and
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:30.640]  was, and then you got to transition into the Don Draper.
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:31.640]  Oh, yeah.
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:32.640]  It's an arc.
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:33.640]  It's an arc.
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:34.640]  That's genius.
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:40.920]  The Gruber Memorial Rotunda that tells the story of your life from a young shitty kid
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:43.040]  to a middle-aged shitty man.
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:46.160]  It is true, I'll tell you.
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.160]  It's funny you bring it up.
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:48.160]  I didn't know you were going to bring this up.
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:54.120]  But I've been haunted my entire life by dreams, and it's very common, everybody has, but dreams
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:57.800]  of school unpreparedness.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:01.720]  In the dream, it's exam day or there's a big homework assignment and it's like, oh my God,
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:02.720]  I blew it off.
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:04.200]  But why would I blow it off until now?
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:06.480]  It's due now, shit.
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:10.520]  And then it's a very unpleasant dream and I'd feel stressed out because when I was young,
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:12.200]  I wanted to get good grades, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:19.080]  But I've started like in the last few years, it's really me in the dream now, and I don't
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:22.080]  care.
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:26.520]  And I literally had a dream that I grew up, my parents' house is across the street from
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:30.080]  the elementary school I went to, literally across the street, and I had a dream that
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:36.360]  my high school social studies teacher, who was great, great guy, Mr. Choyka, and he taught
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:40.240]  us like civics and stuff and taught us cool shit to teach high schoolers, like, hey, when
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.280]  cops come to your door, you don't have to let them in.
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:44.120]  And we use that like high school parties.
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:46.720]  It's like, no, you cannot come in.
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:47.840]  And nobody else knew that.
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:48.840]  He was a great teacher.
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:56.400]  And in my dream, for some reason he's teaching in the elementary school, but it's I'm in
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:04.680]  high school and he's just like, and I'm there and people are noisy and I'm annoyed and Mr.
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:07.140]  Choyka goes, I could use a fucking drink.
[01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:10.720]  And I said, I could get one of my parents' houses across the street.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:12.840]  And he goes, that'd be great.
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:13.840]  And I said, what do you want?
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:16.040]  He goes, well, we've got to make it look like water.
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:17.920]  I swear to God, it's a real dream I had.
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:18.920]  And this is the dream.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:22.320]  I thought this was a real thing that happened.
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:25.800]  I stopped listening for a second and I was like, your teacher was the best teacher.
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:28.080]  No, it's like my dreams of being in school now.
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:29.080]  It's just me.
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:30.360]  I'm like, yeah, I'll get you a drink.
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:33.420]  And I went across there and the funny thing is, and I got him like a gin and tonic and
[01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:35.920]  he told me in the dream, he told me to put extra pepper in it.
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:39.360]  I was like, all right, you're the teacher.
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:41.720]  And the funny thing is my parents don't even have gin in the house.
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:42.720]  I don't know.
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:43.720]  But in my dream world, they do.
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:46.240]  I think I would go visit them a lot more.
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:51.040]  Can I just quickly, quick aside, somebody in the front, somebody in the front have an
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:53.400]  iPhone that they would be willing to use?
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:58.640]  Would you be willing to use, would you keep track of the Gruber university core curriculum
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:00.640]  for us?
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:05.480]  Let's see, nine, nine to 10 at 10 AM, that's blank.
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:25.240]  10 to 2 PM is blank study hall, two to three is Yankees.
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:32.720]  Three to three Oh one is Yankees suck three Oh one to three Oh two is that lady gets unmetriculated.
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:42.300]  We have to address grading, you know, evaluation of, of, of the students in, in, uh, Draper
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:43.300]  Gruber university.
[01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:47.040]  Uh, you know, cause what you said about, you know, you used to care a lot about grades
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:52.360]  until you got smarter and realized, you know, so just forgive me, this, this is a, this
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:54.760]  is a bit of a risk, but I think probably not.
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:58.720]  How many of you out there, uh, were a students?
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:00.400]  Okay.
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:04.080]  How many of you out there were C students?
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:08.080]  The C students always have a way more, uh, fun reaction to that.
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:14.240]  Well, how many, I would guess that on average, uh, and this is totally out of my ass, uh,
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:19.520]  on average C students probably do better in reality than A students because the C students
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:25.280]  are the ones, the C students tell themselves anyway, that too, because the C students were
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:29.720]  the ones who figured out that you don't have to do about 80% of what they assign you in
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:30.720]  school.
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:31.720]  Right.
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:36.360]  So I think part of Gruber, Gruber Draper university, uh, would just be, you know, you, you don't
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:40.920]  tell anybody this for a while and then like, you know, senior year or whatever, last week
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:45.920]  of it, you take any, everyone with a GPA of above like 3.8 and you guys fail.
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:46.920]  Sorry.
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:47.920]  That's brilliant.
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:48.920]  You didn't get it.
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:51.640]  You've wasted way too much time studying on this nonsense.
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:52.640]  Exactly.
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:54.080]  You did everything we asked.
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:56.360]  Why didn't you question that?
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:01.680]  You know, there, I remember when, um, uh, Bushy was the president and, and there were,
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:07.160]  you know, famously, it was not the sharpest pencil in the box and didn't have a terrific
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:08.500]  school record.
[01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:14.580]  There was actually news stories about that, uh, there is a correlation to achieving C
[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:23.960]  level positions in major fortune 500 corporations and having extraordinarily mediocre scholastic
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:24.960]  records.
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:30.560]  Right, well, there's even a phrase for us, the gentleman see that, you know, that, that
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:35.280]  as long as you put up a modicum of effort and you know, you're not going to never show
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:39.280]  up for class, you're going to show up and you're going to take the exam and fail terribly.
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:43.080]  They'll at least give you a C. And that is the people who take advantage of that role
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:45.300]  and they're like, well, wait a second.
[01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:48.200]  The worst I can do is a C I can do nothing.
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:49.200]  Yeah.
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:50.800]  I never did homework.
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:57.280]  I literally did zero homework for my entire academic career and I always almost failed
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:01.160]  some classes here and there and got A's in the easy classes here and there and I came
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:02.160]  out okay.
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.160]  I almost even graduated.
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:04.160]  All right.
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:07.720]  So I think we can, I think we can probably guess that that, that that description does
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:09.600]  not apply to John.
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:10.600]  You would guess wrong.
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:13.080]  I also did not like doing homework at all.
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:20.720]  I just did enough of it to get A's, but Oh, what an asshole.
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:24.440]  No, I didn't, I did not want to do homework at all.
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.320]  I thought it was in a front that I should ever have it.
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:29.800]  And now I get it back because now my son comes home and thinks it is like the worst injustice
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:33.120]  in the world that when he comes home from school, there's still more school to do.
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:34.400]  Right where there's the same way.
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:35.800]  There's right.
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:38.480]  But you're nobody would ever accuse you of being a type a personality.
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:41.000]  Type a is I've got to be valedictorian.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:46.440]  And if I'm salutatorian, I'm going to find a loophole where the valedictorian, uh, you
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:52.380]  know, took a weird class in seventh grade and their 4.0 should be a four, 3.999.
[01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:53.380]  That's not you.
[01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:56.180]  This is what I said to my report card every year for my whole life.
[01:27:56.180 --> 01:28:00.200]  Not working up to potential.
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:03.760]  I've got them all saved as every teacher after teacher would write it.
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:05.400]  But I don't think anybody is surprised by this.
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:09.420]  I think, you know, this comes very clear and, and, and your baseline of the minimum work
[01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:13.680]  to get an a, and you probably did more work to figure out what the minimum work is to
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:17.080]  get an a than the actual work that you did.
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:18.480]  Like you probably knew exactly.
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:19.480]  I wasn't working.
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:20.480]  It's more like subterfuge.
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:24.360]  How many notes home can I hide from my parents before, before they find one?
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:27.480]  This is probably a CPAN module somewhere to calculate.
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:28.480]  Did you know your grades?
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:30.560]  Like, were you ever surprised by your report card?
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:31.560]  Did you know your grades?
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:32.560]  No, I knew my grades.
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.080]  I mean, I was, I was with, I was with the nerds.
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:35.680]  Like the valedictorian was my best friend.
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:36.680]  Right?
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:37.680]  I knew.
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:38.680]  Were you with the nerds?
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:39.680]  You were with the nerds?
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:46.880]  Come on, look, look where you, look where you are, sir.
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:47.880]  That's true.
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:50.000]  I'm the one who's going to get beat up for sure.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.440]  Nah, you can pass.
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:56.180]  All right, but Casey, Casey, to me, you're a mystery man.
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:57.400]  Where did you fall on this?
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:58.800]  What kind of a high school student were you?
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:03.760]  So when I was in grade school, when I was in middle school, total, like I will do every
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:04.880]  bit of homework.
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:07.400]  I'll ask for extra credit, total freaking nerd.
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:13.320]  And then around, then around high school, I realized I just don't fucking care.
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:17.760]  And so I was a terrible, I was an okay high school student, I was a terrible college student.
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:21.160]  Marco and I, I think could probably get into a pretty serious pissing match over who was
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:26.000]  the worst student in college.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.920]  But yeah, so then I just realized, well, it's enough to get by.
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:34.920]  And all that matters in the end is that I have a degree, not a, what was it, change
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:38.100]  agent certificate of authenticity, whatever it was.
[01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:39.100]  And that's all I needed.
[01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:40.100]  What about you, Scott?
[01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:41.760]  Were you a good college student?
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:48.200]  Well, much like Casey, at a certain point I realized that that stuff wasn't important
[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:53.520]  and I stopped being as rule following as I was.
[01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:55.640]  For me, that moment came when I was 37.
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:59.240]  I was going to say, it's when you left Apple, right?
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:02.480]  Yeah, I was like, this is stupid.
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:04.040]  I mean, it's, well, it's stupid.
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:07.080]  It's stupid, but you know, for me, it was, it was the wrong thing.
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:12.800]  And I finally like, was like, okay, I can, I can jump out of this, this path that I thought
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.900]  I had to be on.
[01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:23.800]  I was stressed throughout my college career because I, I went to Drexel on, Drexel, Drexel
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:27.220]  has a slogan much like Draper U, Drexel has an official slogan.
[01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:30.680]  It's we're right next to Penn.
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:34.320]  That is their slogan.
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:36.600]  I forget if I've ever told this story, I don't know if this is going to be too long, but
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:41.780]  the long story short is I was okay student, never really cared about grades, but I was
[01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:44.360]  an exceptionally talented test taker.
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:49.460]  I have truly gifted at taking things like the SAT because it was like being in the matrix
[01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:51.840]  where I could see why they were asking the question.
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:55.560]  I couldn't even answer it, but I can see clearly they mean see, I don't understand what these
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:31:01.200]  words mean, but I, I, I could understand the SAT at a meta level and scored very, very
[01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:02.200]  high.
[01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:06.600]  This was in the early nineties before they rescored them and let people get high grades.
[01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:13.240]  But in like 10th grade, I took the SAT as a test like, this isn't for real.
[01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:15.560]  We're going to take it for real next year.
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:19.040]  And when you take the SAT, at least you did back then, you'd say, what schools do you
[01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:21.040]  want it sent to for free?
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:23.200]  And I didn't, hadn't done any research on where to go.
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:25.040]  And I picked basketball schools that I liked.
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:31.240]  I picked North Carolina and Villanova and Syracuse, uh, yeah, I think all the big East
[01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:36.960]  teams and, and everybody, but Duke and ACC, uh, and I had no intention of going to any
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:38.840]  of these schools and, and they were still open slots.
[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:42.280]  And my friend who was with me, his sister went to Drexel goes, put Drexel down.
[01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:43.280]  They're cool.
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:44.800]  I was like, all right, Drexel.
[01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:46.200]  And I got a really high score.
[01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:51.360]  I got like a 1420 and then they go to the next year and I got a 1460.
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:53.280]  And by that time though, I knew where I wanted to go.
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:57.640]  And I had this list of schools and it was a lot more practical and Drexel wasn't even
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:58.640]  listed and blah, blah, blah.
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:31:59.640]  And I thought I was going to Penn state.
[01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:04.040]  And one day the phone rings and it's somebody is like, I'm somebody from Drexel university.
[01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:05.440]  I want to speak to John Gruber.
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:07.020]  And I said, yeah, that's me.
[01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:10.760]  And they said, yes, we'd like you to come to Drexel on a full tuition scholarship.
[01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:13.760]  And I said, uh, well, what do I have to do?
[01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:17.120]  And I'd already been filling out all these essays for scholarships to other schools.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:21.680]  He was like, um, can you play badminton?
[01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:24.860]  They the answer was you, you, well, you need to apply.
[01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:29.160]  And I was like, all right, it was like work already.
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:32.460]  I was like, I was like, well, well then, then what?
[01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:35.380]  And and uh, I'm like, no, that's it.
[01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:40.340]  And we have a, we have a, we're, we have a policy where if you've scored a 1400 or higher
[01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:43.600]  on your SAT, you can come to Drexel for free.
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:47.700]  You know, it's pronounced sat.
[01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:49.240]  It's a more efficient way to say it.
[01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:50.580]  Well, it's a Tim Cook.
[01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:52.080]  It's Tim Cook.
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:55.000]  And and, and I was like, would that, do you mean that's all I have to do is apply?
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.960]  And then I go for free and they're like, yeah.
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:57.960]  And I was like, well, what is tuition?
[01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:01.360]  Because I didn't do any research and they're like, and it just is 1991.
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.560]  So it's, I mean, it's probably like $50,000 a year now.
[01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:04.560]  They're like, it's $16,000 a year.
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:07.040]  And I was like, and I don't have to pay any of it.
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:08.480]  And they're like, yeah.
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:11.540]  And I was like, oh, and I got off the phone and my dad was like, who is that?
[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:12.920]  And I was like, I don't know, it's Drexel.
[01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:19.120]  I guess I'm going there because it was like I had the, I don't know, I was complicating
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:21.280]  you know, money for colleges.
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:22.280]  It's crazy how much college costs.
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:26.080]  And we had this complicated thing where we were taking out loans and all this stuff.
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:32.720]  And and the only catch was I had to keep a 3.0 grade point average for my whole academic
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:33.720]  career.
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:34.720]  No deal.
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:37.160]  It was very, very stressful my first two years.
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:42.080]  But then I, I knew other people who had this scholarship and the backstory of it is that
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:45.280]  Drexel is really, well, maybe they're better now, but when I was there, they were really
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:49.300]  not a good school and they had really low average SAT scores.
[01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:51.180]  They were like a safety school.
[01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:55.320]  And so their idea for raising the average SAT score was, we'll let people who score
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:34:00.960]  1300 or higher go for half tuition and 1400, you go for free.
[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:05.840]  And so I ended up like, like I had like six roommates in a big apartment at one point
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:10.320]  and like half of us were there for free because we'd scored 1400 and couldn't go to a good
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:13.040]  school because we couldn't pay for it.
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:17.440]  But then I figured out halfway through my, my college career that the, there was a grace
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:19.440]  period on the GPA thing.
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:24.480]  Like they don't just like you, you fall to a 2.9 and they're like, Oh, sorry, you have
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:25.480]  to go.
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:28.160]  You, you get like a, I don't know what you call it.
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:37.320]  Just just to note the, the daily curriculum, three to four grace period.
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:38.320]  But I liked it.
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:39.320]  I had a good time there.
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:45.200]  I think I finished with like a three point, like zero, zero, zero, zero, zero to GPA.
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:49.840]  It was incredibly close, but I never did dip down and I never got the letter.
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:53.240]  I think about this a lot, especially having moved from the east coast to the west coast.
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:57.800]  So when I was on the east coast, also it was the early nineties, it was like, you go to
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:58.800]  college.
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:01.880]  It's just what you do, obviously.
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:07.120]  But then coming to the west coast and seeing all these people achieve amazing things without
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:13.360]  ever having gone to college and also watching college tuitions go from super expensive to
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:18.280]  what the Caden has to be like, you buy a car for college tuition.
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:20.600]  Now you could buy like a really, really nice car.
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:25.160]  Yeah, you can buy a nice car for like the whole, you can buy like four cars for, for
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:26.300]  the four years.
[01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:29.560]  So it's not that expensive.
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:30.560]  Could buy a Tesla.
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:35.080]  You could, you could buy four Teslas for the cost that it goes to, or for the college cost
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:37.440]  Casey or Casey, Margo, you'll find out.
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:38.440]  Yeah.
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:39.440]  So you guys, let's just pull the on it.
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:41.480]  How many people here went to college?
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:43.760]  Well, we got to hear it.
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:46.320]  We can't see shit, right?
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:47.320]  Okay.
[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:55.640]  How many people graduated from college and how many people never went to college?
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:56.640]  I love you guys.
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:57.640]  Those are my people.
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:58.640]  Small number.
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:02.360]  They're the people who got smart at an earlier age, right?
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:04.120]  So do you believe that college is necessary?
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:09.080]  So for folks like this, for, for, you know, going in the world of like being a developer
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:11.760]  or something like that, do you need to go to college still?
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:13.400]  I don't know.
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:21.120]  I think you need to go to college if you think you do so that you can learn that you don't.
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:26.760]  That's really profound advice, but I totally can't believe it with those beats around your
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:29.240]  neck.
[01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:31.600]  This lends me credibility among the youths, right?
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:34.920]  Isn't that why Apple bought them?
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:38.280]  The youths, youths.
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:39.280]  Did you say youth?
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:40.280]  I don't know.
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:46.360]  Do you guys have anything else we want to talk about school?
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:49.440]  I mean, we should wrap up soon, but school is great.
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:52.440]  Love school.
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:54.080]  School is good for the life stuff.
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:57.960]  Like it's good to learn how to drink in college.
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:01.680]  That's good to learn how to live by yourself for the first time.
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:02.680]  That's nice.
[01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:04.160]  So there's an adulthood element to it.
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:07.520]  Is it worth $60,000 a year?
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:12.640]  No, but while we're, you know, open kimono, life story, porn and all on the table, I went
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:13.640]  to college.
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:15.640]  I did not drink.
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:22.780]  I started to drink slightly while I was in college, but didn't really start drinking
[01:37:22.780 --> 01:37:25.160]  until like my mid twenties.
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:26.960]  I actually had a fairly similar experience.
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:30.800]  I vividly remember it was one day over the summer before I'm about to go to college.
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:35.600]  I went to college at Virginia Tech and my dad sits me down.
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:38.080]  Just to note, nobody applauded for Virginia Tech.
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:39.080]  Thank you.
[01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:40.080]  I know.
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:41.080]  It's all right.
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:42.080]  I'm the other guy.
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:43.080]  It's fine.
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:44.080]  No, but so my dad sits me down.
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:45.080]  My dad sits me down and he puts something in front of me.
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:46.080]  I can't remember what it was.
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:49.120]  And he says, you need to drink this.
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:50.640]  Okay.
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:53.380]  You're going to drink more than one.
[01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:54.380]  What is it?
[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:57.320]  I had a little sip and God knows what it was and I probably choked it up.
[01:37:57.320 --> 01:37:58.320]  How old were you?
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:00.800]  I was 18 because I'd never really had booze before.
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:04.680]  And they, my dad basically sat me down and said, you were getting fucking hammered tonight.
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:09.320]  So this way, when you go to school, you know what this feels like and you, and you will
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:10.320]  be okay.
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:15.720]  Casey drank 11 melon tini's that night.
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:16.720]  It was easy on the tini.
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:18.840]  Dad, why are you giving me melon tini's?
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:19.840]  Shut up.
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:20.840]  Drink it.
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:22.600]  Did he also make you smoke a whole pack of cigarettes?
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:23.600]  No, no, no, none of that.
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:24.600]  None of that.
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:25.600]  None of that.
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:27.600]  But no, that, that, that was my first real drinking experience.
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:31.600]  And then I, you know, drank a little bit in college and, and now, now supposedly drunk
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:35.760]  me is somewhere in the audience or so I'm told, so let's hear it for drunk Casey out
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:36.760]  in the audience.
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:43.340]  Mystery, the mystery tweeter, there used to be a drunk Gruber account, but then the guy
[01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:45.040]  stopped updating it.
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:46.040]  Yeah.
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:56.400]  I took him, pour one out for drunk Gruber.
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:03.160]  What do you, what do you used to do is try to guess which tweets of mine I tweeted while
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:08.680]  intoxicated and it was funny because he was pretty good, but not that good.
[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:09.680]  It was like, you know what?
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:11.800]  It is pretty late, but I'm actually stone cold sober tonight.
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:19.880]  And I actually just tweeted that now you, you never really were drinkers that I know
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:20.880]  you got it out of your system.
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:24.200]  I did all my drinking in high school then it stopped.
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:25.200]  It pains me.
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:26.200]  Is that true?
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:27.200]  No, is that true?
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:28.200]  No, that's totally true.
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:30.520]  I get high school is like, we'd have the guy with the receding hairline, get beer at the
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:32.320]  gas station and we would all drink.
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:38.920]  See new Marco in high school, zing.
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:39.920]  There is a function.
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:42.400]  This is an evolutionary niche for those people.
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:48.160]  Bold move for the guy holding Marco's microphone.
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:49.720]  Pretty good one though.
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:51.400]  I wasn't going to have Casey come out.
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:54.600]  I was just going to, you know, I'm glad I did.
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:57.720]  Let's hear it for Casey with the zing.
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:39:59.920]  I'm glad I've earned my keep after all.
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:03.040]  No, I, I did not drink a lick in high school.
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:09.280]  I, I had friends who did and they'd have parties and I was the official, just in case the cops
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:12.600]  show up, this is the guy who paid attention to Mr. Troika's class and knows how to deal
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:13.600]  with it.
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:14.600]  Guy.
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:15.600]  Yeah.
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:18.720]  Write down Mr. Troika dream four to five.
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:19.720]  Yeah.
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:20.720]  That's a class.
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:25.600]  That's a, that's a semester talking about your dreams that you had about your high school
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:26.600]  teacher.
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:27.600]  So can we go back?
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:29.600]  Can we explore what drunk John was like?
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:33.560]  Like I never got drunk.
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:36.520]  I shouldn't be surprised by this, but that's terrible.
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:41.880]  I just, I envisioned like this really chipper, happy, like touchy feely John, like, Hey man,
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:42.880]  give me a hug.
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:45.320]  Like, Oh, it's all in your head.
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:46.320]  Yeah, I know.
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:47.320]  That's my dream.
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:49.080]  That's my dream is meeting drunk John.
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:51.680]  What was the high school drinking situation like where you went?
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:53.840]  Where does it like a go out in the woods type of situation?
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:57.960]  Was it like people's houses with parents weren't home totally right.
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:40:59.960]  What is wrong with those parents?
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:00.960]  Right?
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:08.320]  I mean, now that we're adults and we're the parents, the idea that I would leave, maybe
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:12.940]  see like if you were my son, then I think, Oh, I had them in my house too.
[01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:16.400]  You know, when you've got the kid who's going to have a party when the parents go, I bet
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:19.400]  that's exactly what my parents thought, but they were wrong because it's not like I made
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:20.400]  the party.
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:21.400]  It's like, whose parents aren't home.
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:22.400]  Okay.
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:23.400]  Everyone go there.
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:27.760]  I did not think that we would relate on anything.
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:34.720]  My mother was a, she, she, she, she met a man and he lived in Minnesota and so she would
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:38.920]  travel to visit him and she'd be like, well, the house is yours.
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:39.920]  Take care of it.
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:40.920]  And I was very similar.
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:43.120]  Like she just trusted me.
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:45.820]  What a bad idea.
[01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:49.280]  It was, it was part, it was a party every time she left.
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:51.640]  It was crazy and it was fun.
[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:58.200]  I'm pretty sure because of those parties, I was voted most well-rounded in high school.
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:41:59.720]  Like that's the only thing that I did.
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:01.320]  I didn't do sports.
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:03.840]  So I think that was what it was for me.
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:08.960]  So there's actually, so I was left alone all summer for, for most high school summers.
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:11.680]  That's just cause they forgot about you.
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:12.720]  Yeah.
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:16.120]  And I am actually such a nerd that I didn't do anything bad.
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:19.400]  I'm actually more of a nerd than John Syracuse on something.
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:20.400]  You had nicer friends.
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:22.000]  I mean, I had, people were bad influence on me.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  I wouldn't have done it on my own.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.560]  I was, I was roped into it.
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:25.560]  Oh sure.
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:26.560]  Yeah.
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:27.560]  It's, it's their fault.
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:28.560]  You were left at home for the whole summer.
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:29.560]  Yeah.
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:30.560]  My mom is a teacher.
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:34.400]  She would go upstate and upstate New York for the summer and I would go when I was younger.
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:36.640]  But then once I got older, you know, I didn't want to go up there.
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:38.440]  I wanted to stay with my friends in high school.
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:41.680]  And so yeah, I was like, you know, 17, 18 alone all summer.
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:42.680]  It was awesome.
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:46.040]  And you just stayed home like drinking soda and playing video games.
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:47.240]  Pretty much.
[01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:48.500]  Yeah.
[01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:50.880]  I was doing all this crap programming and all that.
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:51.880]  Yeah.
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:54.420]  That's that's why, that's how I got started programming and it was instead of being, having
[01:42:54.420 --> 01:43:01.440]  a social life, just like probably many of you out there, I was, I was doing that.
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:06.020]  So at that point you were in college and then you went to the actual college to not really
[01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:07.400]  do anything productive.
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:08.600]  So that was your college.
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:15.160]  Well, yeah, in college I just found new ways to be a nerd, you know, just, just more, more,
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:17.640]  you know, I drank some blood in college.
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:22.120]  You know, I have a very vivid, I have a very vivid memory from my freshman year of college
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:27.080]  of I'm in the dorm and my roommate was a guy I went to high school with.
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:32.760]  He was actually the guy who told me back in 10th grade to put Drexel on the thing.
[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:35.440]  And we, you know, went and I didn't want to take a random roommate.
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:36.760]  That seemed like a sucker move.
[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:38.160]  So I was like, Oh, why we should be roommates.
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:41.480]  Even, you know, we weren't best friends, but it's like, I knew I could live with the guy.
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:42.600]  He pledged a fraternity.
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:47.060]  A lot of the guys on my floor pledged fraternities and they went to these fraternity parties
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:49.920]  and I remember very specifically what the game was.
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:57.540]  I stayed to play leisure suit, Larry, eight bit boobs, right?
[01:43:57.540 --> 01:44:01.360]  And I felt like I was being pretty bad ass.
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:05.120]  There were boobs in the game, uh, four to five, five to six.
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:06.120]  Where are we?
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:15.720]  Five to six, uh, leisure suit, Larry, eight bit boobs.
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:16.720]  We're getting late on time.
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:17.720]  I don't know.
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:18.720]  Do you guys have anything else?
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:19.720]  Uh, any more stuff?
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:20.720]  All right.
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:22.000]  Why don't we wrap it up?
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.360]  I would like to do some thanks.
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:29.960]  I have a lot of people, uh, well, no, a couple of people that I would like to thank.
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:34.120]  I would like to thank Megan here at mezzanine and the whole staff and mezzanine.
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:38.400]  What a great place this is.
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:39.840]  We did this show here last year.
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:43.000]  I hope we do it again next year, but what a great place.
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:47.660]  It's just a great facility, but the staff in the bar, everything's great.
[01:44:47.660 --> 01:44:52.080]  So thanks to Megan and everybody here at mezzanine, uh, Jesse Char.
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:53.400]  She helped produce the show.
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:57.680]  She's here in San Francisco.
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:44:58.680]  She runs a place.
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:04.800]  She runs a, uh, uh, app design development shop, Pacific helm, pacifichelm.com.
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:06.380]  They do great work there.
[01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:07.380]  They do such good work.
[01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:11.320]  It's probably hard to get in on them, but if you need to check out, need somebody to
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:14.040]  help you design or develop an app, check out Pacific helm.
[01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:15.040]  Great stuff.
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:19.800]  Uh, I want to give a special thank you to someone who, who I should have thanked a couple
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:24.440]  episodes ago, but Caleb Sexton, Caleb Sexton, uh, is here.
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:27.840]  He's helping with us with the audio, make sure everything sounds good, but he was at
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:28.840]  mule.
[01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:29.840]  He's at mule radio.
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:35.160]  Um, and I should have thanked him a couple of episodes when I did the show with Mike
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:40.560]  Montero on the last show that I did while the show was on mule, but Caleb, uh, has been
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:46.520]  helping me with the talk show ever since I've taken it solo and, uh, everything good about
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:52.000]  the audio quality and the editing and finding funny little things to stick into the audio
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:57.960]  for two years, uh, 99.97% of that is from Caleb Sexton.
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:01.960]  And I should have thanked him two weeks ago, but let me thank him tonight when he's here.
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:07.400]  Let's give it up for Caleb Sexton, my friend.
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:12.120]  Uh, I want to thank our sponsors, Microsoft for sponsoring this big event, Microsoft and
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:14.160]  check out Azure mobile services.
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:20.280]  If you haven't looked at them, they're great, um, market circle with their great apps, daylight
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:30.360]  and Billings pro and, uh, probably the biggest applause here, but are good friends at, uh,
[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:31.360]  who sponsored the bar?
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:37.240]  I forget the email company, the cool guys who make it easy to do an email to a lot of
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:38.240]  people.
[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:39.240]  I don't get it.
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:40.240]  Oh yeah.
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:41.240]  MailChimp.
[01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:52.200]  No, but let's hear it for MailChimp, uh, oh, also, uh, shooting video tonight.
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:53.200]  I don't know when it's going to come out.
[01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:58.740]  We're going to hopefully release this at some point, but a couple of guys here from, uh,
[01:46:58.740 --> 01:47:04.520]  they're putting together a documentary called app, the human story, and it's a documentary
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:09.760]  about the rise of apps as like a thing that we care about and like even probably just
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:13.800]  like a word, like the fact that everybody like in the developed world knows what an
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:14.800]  app is now.
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:19.240]  Uh, they have a website, app documentary.com.
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:20.560]  They're going to do a Kickstarter soon.
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:23.840]  It's not open yet, but it's a really cool idea for a documentary.
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:29.080]  I think it's really sort of a story of the decade and tech, uh, they're here shooting
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:34.080]  video to, to, so we have an archive of the show, uh, so let's hear it for them.
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:39.000]  Stay tuned to during fireball, a tweet when they have their Kickstarter, uh, and then
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:45.880]  last but not least, uh, you for gentlemen, Marco Arment, Casey lists, John Siracusa and
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:47.300]  Scott Simpson.
[01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:50.300]  Thank you.
[01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:55.700]  And last but not least, thanks to all of you for coming blows my mind that so many people
[01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:58.160]  come to see us, uh, be up here and be dummies.
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:04.640]  Clapper John's cool purple shirt, he's branching out, give it to him.
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:06.000]  What a delightful man.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  John Gruber.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  Clapper John.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:12.440]  He's the best doctors, right?
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:18.200]  Provost.
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:19.240]  I think that's the end of the show.
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:20.240]  We'll call that.
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:21.240]  We'll say the show's over.
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:22.240]  We're in the postscript plan.
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:25.120]  I think we're technically supposed to be out of here by nine.
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:27.320]  It's 10 of, you know, you guys want to have another.
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:29.080]  I don't know if they closed the bar.
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:32.520]  I don't know, but we, you, you don't have to rush out.
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:37.000]  Let's calm and orderly if you want to chill, if you want to chug another drink, have another
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:38.000]  drink.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.760]  It's all on a male chimp, but thank you for coming.
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:43.120]  Uh, but we got to get out of here.
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:57.680]  Take 10, 15 minutes.
