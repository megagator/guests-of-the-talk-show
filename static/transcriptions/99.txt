[00:00.000 --> 00:07.200]  hello hello how are you I'm good how are you you sound alright how do I see
[00:07.200 --> 00:13.320]  sound you sound surprisingly good is this is LTE this is LTE you're
[00:13.320 --> 00:22.720]  kidding no oh man it Verizon good old Verizon so the back story is that we we
[00:22.720 --> 00:28.560]  I can't stop looking at this picture we were supposed to record 36 minutes ago
[00:28.560 --> 00:34.000]  and I was I was going to be ready when all of a sudden I my home internet went
[00:34.000 --> 00:39.880]  out and just like a hard stop like nothing loaded and then I started getting
[00:39.880 --> 00:44.840]  activation page like what you would get if you ever you don't pay your bill
[00:44.840 --> 00:49.760]  no more like if you have a brand new like brand new stuff you know like you
[00:49.760 --> 00:54.120]  just moved into cable town like you just moved here you got your Comcast box
[00:54.120 --> 00:58.920]  this is what you see but like actually trying to do the activation doesn't
[00:58.920 --> 01:04.000]  doesn't do it and so you had the good idea we're texting and you told me to use
[01:04.000 --> 01:07.880]  my phone go to the Comcast site and see if they tell you that there's an
[01:07.880 --> 01:14.720]  average and it it worked I logged into my Comcast account and it gave me a
[01:14.720 --> 01:21.600]  message here that says hello John John all caps John it's an all caps and out
[01:21.600 --> 01:26.360]  it just been reported in your area we expect this to be resolved by today and
[01:26.360 --> 01:31.560]  then you you can describe I sent this to you yeah we'll include this image in
[01:31.560 --> 01:35.040]  the show notes or somehow in the art so everybody all of you deserve to
[01:35.040 --> 01:39.440]  enjoy this but Merlin for that historical record can you describe this
[01:39.440 --> 01:45.400]  this image sure sure I think it's it's clearly it comes from the same grand
[01:45.400 --> 01:51.160]  tradition as the blinking under construction gif from back in the day I guess
[01:51.160 --> 01:57.440]  the primary feature is a big white van that says Xfinity on it right close
[01:57.440 --> 02:01.080]  enough right this is this is gonna be a repair guy and then I'm sure a stock
[02:01.080 --> 02:05.880]  art guy in a red and black check shirt with that hard hat climbing a yellow
[02:05.880 --> 02:11.400]  ladder right so so so far so good it's an image to show you that you we
[02:11.400 --> 02:14.920]  expect this to be resolved by today it gets interesting though because the
[02:14.920 --> 02:20.440]  ladder is situated with a very strange incorrect drop shadow he's basically it
[02:20.440 --> 02:27.120]  appears to be about to fix an 11 foot high orange safety cone it's a lot
[02:27.120 --> 02:31.480]  higher than 11 feet I think I think it's about a 15 foot safety guy the
[02:31.480 --> 02:34.280]  guys there's there's one orange construction cone on the right side of the
[02:34.280 --> 02:37.680]  page that's upright that's at least 10 feet high and another one another safety
[02:37.680 --> 02:43.320]  cone next to it that's fallen over and this guy on a ladder is he's on a ladder
[02:43.320 --> 02:47.640]  and he's behind the cone he's probably about five feet behind the cone climbing
[02:47.640 --> 02:53.900]  a ladder oh and did I mention there's also a dog chasing a cat the
[02:53.900 --> 02:58.120]  foreground and then the really subtle part is in the upper right hand corner for
[02:58.120 --> 03:03.920]  reasons I'm not entirely sure of there's a bird flying by you do you really
[03:03.920 --> 03:07.560]  have to see it to appreciate but he looks he looks like he's there to fix the
[03:07.560 --> 03:21.640]  safety cone and uh anyway they're working on that why why why is there
[03:23.000 --> 03:29.640]  why why is the time to put a drop shadow on everything they aren't right the
[03:29.640 --> 03:32.840]  drop shadow on the ladder has no relationship with the cone that he's
[03:32.840 --> 03:37.520]  theoretically fixing it's just a drop shadow stops it's almost as though we're
[03:37.520 --> 03:41.720]  seeing the cone drop from the sky just right next to where he happens to be
[03:41.720 --> 03:51.840]  climbing a ladder to nothing so he pivoted so I pivoted now we're doing it
[03:51.840 --> 03:56.960]  over LT yeah I should probably close this but I kind of feel like I can't I
[03:56.960 --> 03:59.640]  told you I'll tell you when we're texting this is nothing against cable
[03:59.640 --> 04:03.160]  town they're a great company but I swear to Christ every time I see or hear
[04:03.160 --> 04:08.120]  that word exfinity I just it makes me see and I can't even tell you why I mean
[04:08.120 --> 04:13.160]  in the same way that like farfic nugan in the like late 80s was funny like
[04:13.160 --> 04:17.960]  exfinity is offensive to me because that's their whole their whole branded line
[04:17.960 --> 04:22.800]  of something involving a cable lifestyle in your home is that right or
[04:22.800 --> 04:27.520]  business I think that's what they would tell you that that's probably probably
[04:27.520 --> 04:34.840]  the exact words that they used that when they came up with the idea that
[04:34.840 --> 04:38.560]  they would stop caught just calling themselves Comcast and that you know
[04:38.560 --> 04:43.920]  that they would that Comcast would be some kind of parent brand for all of
[04:43.920 --> 04:47.480]  their various endeavors you know like their Comcast logo now they've they've
[04:47.480 --> 04:53.080]  taken the NBC peacock it's you know part of their like they're a content
[04:53.080 --> 04:58.720]  company now they have a they have NBC they have universal and so like the cable
[04:58.720 --> 05:03.240]  business is is now exfinity and I believe that what you those words you just
[05:03.240 --> 05:08.320]  uses probably how they they they probably pitched it they would use the phrase
[05:08.320 --> 05:13.360]  SMB probably for small business they still use that you still hear SMB note
[05:13.360 --> 05:18.200]  yeah yeah I mean I think it's it's you know it's funny because you think
[05:18.200 --> 05:21.800]  about think about like when Dropbox came along and well one of the gosh half
[05:21.800 --> 05:25.320]  dozen things it was so mind-blowing about Dropbox is they were doing something
[05:25.320 --> 05:29.200]  that had been very difficult for any number of reasons to do before not least
[05:29.200 --> 05:34.640]  because being a commodity or being a utility is not interesting and it's not
[05:34.640 --> 05:40.800]  sexy and having dependable you know file-syncing in that case was was an
[05:40.800 --> 05:44.720]  unsolved problem that was not on the face of it that profitable right so there's
[05:44.720 --> 05:47.200]  so many things you know setting aside the fact that the sink actually worked
[05:47.200 --> 05:50.680]  which was mind-blowing but I mean you think about it your cable company now I'm
[05:50.680 --> 05:53.480]  sure you've seen that graph it's gone around about how the cable companies have
[05:53.480 --> 05:56.880]  like come together over the years you know like in the 80s there was like 30
[05:56.880 --> 06:01.000]  different cable providers and now there's like four or whatever yeah so I
[06:01.000 --> 06:04.320]  mentioned that thinking was like we've got to have some kind of a way to brand
[06:04.320 --> 06:09.640]  the notion of this coaxial cable coming into your house that's going to give
[06:09.640 --> 06:12.880]  you a suite of services right you got your internet connection you got your
[06:12.880 --> 06:16.600]  TV you what else you got oh look at the home monitoring right you can give
[06:16.600 --> 06:21.360]  security it's not part of the exfinity package I believe it is not any lifestyle
[06:21.360 --> 06:24.880]  right yeah you get you're not just a coaxial cable where you where you watch
[06:24.880 --> 06:29.880]  sports no this is an entire lifestyle Xfinity that you're your landline telephone
[06:29.880 --> 06:35.120]  service yeah and they really want you to get that whole package boy you call
[06:35.120 --> 06:38.080]  them up for anything and boy they really want to they what it what it's gonna
[06:38.080 --> 06:45.240]  take to put you into a phone today I have it I have the thing and we don't we
[06:45.240 --> 06:50.160]  don't have a single landline phone that's actually hooked up to a phone
[06:50.160 --> 06:55.680]  jack in the house so we have a phone number and it never rings but it
[06:55.680 --> 07:02.200]  really I think it costs less than if we just had internet I don't know I'm
[07:02.200 --> 07:07.360]  too weird I'm overdue to call them and to go through the pantomime I'm years
[07:07.360 --> 07:11.160]  overdue of the the the like I'm sure it's Syracuse it probably does this you
[07:11.160 --> 07:14.040]  know once the AK as I can remind her once a year because you really need to you
[07:14.040 --> 07:18.000]  call them up and say I'm going to cancel my service and then they say oh God
[07:18.000 --> 07:21.400]  no and then they give you know cut you a deal and give you faster service at
[07:21.400 --> 07:24.920]  a lower price you know like you're a new customer because if you're like me
[07:24.920 --> 07:28.040]  and you're a dummy and you signed up a couple years ago and you just let it
[07:28.040 --> 07:32.640]  go you're your promotional rate ended at some point and now you know I pay I
[07:32.640 --> 07:36.920]  don't know $200 a month for something I could probably you know pay a lot less
[07:36.920 --> 07:41.320]  for right that that happened to me with 18t I need to carefully look at this
[07:41.320 --> 07:46.280]  month's bill but I I called them up to I think I was calling partly because
[07:46.280 --> 07:49.360]  there's a weird charge I guess I was also just asking about iPhone update
[07:49.360 --> 07:53.520]  availability anyway I ended up calling them and you know the the drill where they
[07:53.520 --> 07:57.200]  like want to talk to you about special offers and stuff like that no that's why
[07:57.200 --> 08:01.880]  I don't know no it's the worst but I have to say you know actually AT&T my
[08:01.880 --> 08:06.600]  experience I don't love that service or company I mean I really don't but the
[08:06.600 --> 08:09.520]  people that you end up talking to are pretty great at AT&T sometimes but long
[08:09.520 --> 08:13.160]  story short this this woman was like well did you know we were that like you
[08:13.160 --> 08:15.920]  could really bring your bill down I was like tell me about it what do I have to
[08:15.920 --> 08:19.600]  do to bring my bill down and she's like well we can just change this family
[08:19.600 --> 08:22.480]  data package and D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.D. and now my my phone bill dropped by like a
[08:22.480 --> 08:26.280]  hundred dollars yeah I know exactly what you mean no but I'm of course I'm
[08:26.280 --> 08:31.320]  naturally very you know it's very skeptical because you figure I was like
[08:31.320 --> 08:33.960]  and so of course now I'm looking for a catch guy I'm like oh what does it
[08:33.960 --> 08:37.560]  mean we're re upping for like another five years we got to get a Samsung tablet
[08:37.560 --> 08:42.120]  like what is it what's the downside of this doesn't just you just pay less
[08:42.120 --> 08:46.760]  money that's what you'd want to do it's like all right
[08:46.760 --> 08:50.320]  it's a Stockholm syndrome you know I'm like she's being so nice to me and I
[08:50.320 --> 08:53.800]  feel like you know I don't want to I you know whenever I talk to a customer
[08:53.800 --> 08:57.200]  service person I'm terrified I really don't want to incur their wrath because I
[08:57.200 --> 09:01.400]  don't know there's a few ways they can help you and about a million ways they
[09:01.400 --> 09:05.680]  could screw you up all right or yeah make things worse yeah right all of a
[09:05.680 --> 09:08.480]  sudden you're you know you signed up for a three hundred dollar a month
[09:08.480 --> 09:11.920]  international data plan yeah you're getting the the plot the plot in the
[09:11.920 --> 09:18.760]  mover night web package and they go daddy you always feels used to feel
[09:18.760 --> 09:21.240]  sometimes they've gotten better at this over the years but with go daddy I
[09:21.240 --> 09:24.840]  used to feel like I was running down a hallway well it doesn't frat boys were
[09:24.840 --> 09:29.720]  trying to hit me with a sock full of pennies like oh oh can I just no I don't
[09:29.720 --> 09:31.520]  need anything tonight I don't need anything over night I don't even
[09:31.520 --> 09:38.120]  platinum so what this domain I don't think that I don't think Comcast knows
[09:38.120 --> 09:42.280]  what to do with their money I really don't I mean they've spent a ton of it
[09:42.280 --> 09:45.520]  here I mean it's you know this is cable town and I've ever said this before on
[09:45.520 --> 09:49.960]  the show where they've built the tallest sky stripper and Philadelphia and
[09:49.960 --> 09:54.200]  now they're building another one like one block over that's gonna be even
[09:54.200 --> 10:01.480]  bigger and nobody really knows why you know it's that they've just got more
[10:01.480 --> 10:06.560]  money than they know what to do it yeah yeah I hadn't thought about this in
[10:06.560 --> 10:10.160]  this way too much but sometimes it seems like you've got in the case of these
[10:10.160 --> 10:14.560]  like especially legacy carriers from back in the day you've got well there's
[10:14.560 --> 10:18.160]  the stuff we made money within the past like a million years ago there's an
[10:18.160 --> 10:23.040]  infrastructure that we built like all the investments we made over the years and
[10:23.040 --> 10:29.160]  then there's this rapidly evolving market for what people actually want and
[10:29.160 --> 10:33.560]  all of that stuff that we see as being very valuable just simply does not
[10:33.560 --> 10:37.160]  register for most people and in my case in San Francisco I mean I get one
[10:37.160 --> 10:42.240]  dot on of coverage so much at the time with with AT&T it's which luckily is
[10:42.240 --> 10:44.880]  great because I don't use the phone hardly at all but you know it's just
[10:44.880 --> 10:48.840]  it's interesting to me like how you take being a commodity business you know
[10:48.840 --> 10:51.840]  it's been around for a long time and you know because of the nature of the
[10:51.840 --> 10:56.160]  business can never really be that innovative that fast so what do you do
[10:56.160 --> 10:59.280]  we sell iPhones you sell Samsung tablets or whatever but it's interesting
[10:59.280 --> 11:02.200]  like what they want in the case of Xfinity like so here's what we want you
[11:02.200 --> 11:06.080]  to know us for we want you to know us for this thing called Xfinity and you
[11:06.080 --> 11:08.240]  know the way that they're actually making all their money who knows how
[11:08.240 --> 11:12.920]  they're actually making all their money but they want to be known for as well as
[11:12.920 --> 11:16.760]  this like lifestyle product that's completely up to date and innovative you
[11:16.760 --> 11:20.520]  know yeah does that make sense you know it's just that you when you're talking
[11:20.520 --> 11:23.840]  about like fiber and stuff like that that's not something you do as easily as
[11:23.840 --> 11:27.680]  you change a logo I mean these are there's a lot of infrastructure behind what
[11:27.680 --> 11:31.280]  all these companies do and certainly you can spin up various kinds of data
[11:31.280 --> 11:35.720]  centers and CDNs or whatever but at the same time I mean that's all just
[11:35.720 --> 11:40.360]  changing so fast it right now Comcast is a coaxial cable that comes into my house
[11:40.360 --> 11:44.000]  that lets me stream things and you know and use the internet but we don't have
[11:44.000 --> 11:48.800]  cable TV we don't you know I you know we should talk about my MLB experience
[11:48.800 --> 11:52.360]  another great one but no but for me that's just like that's a dumb cable that
[11:52.360 --> 11:56.920]  comes in and it's a zero or one it either works fine or it doesn't and that's
[11:56.920 --> 12:03.960]  that's the entire Xfinity value proposition to me dogs chasing cats yeah
[12:03.960 --> 12:06.960]  look at that guy see the cats got a drop shadow yeah it looks like it's
[12:06.960 --> 12:10.360]  probably noon it's in looks like it might be inside Johnny Ives bubble it's very
[12:10.360 --> 12:14.960]  white except for the Xfinity van and the cones and the man in the bird doesn't
[12:14.960 --> 12:19.000]  need a drop shadow I'll come how come that I just noticed this is another
[12:19.000 --> 12:24.560]  detail here the icon next to get a it says get a one-time text when services
[12:24.560 --> 12:30.360]  restored and the icon next to it is a power power one hundred ten you know
[12:30.360 --> 12:40.040]  plug in American electric plug yeah I don't get it yeah what are the other I
[12:40.040 --> 12:43.760]  see there's like a a read more is like a three-dot interface here if you
[12:43.760 --> 12:48.320]  click those arrows and go to the other pages what do you get it's it's changed
[12:48.320 --> 12:52.600]  because in the meantime I've gone through the the one I signed up to get that
[12:52.600 --> 13:01.000]  text there's a hello John Xfinity fall TV sweepstakes you can learn more

[14:30.960 --> 14:35.000]  drinks honestly I'm there must be some reason for but why would they why would my
[14:35.000 --> 14:39.120]  reward come in the form of prepaid Visa cards like I'm a drug dealer or
[14:39.120 --> 14:46.120]  something why wouldn't they just give me credits on my bill I don't know or

[14:52.560 --> 14:56.320]  the grand prize you can win a ten thousand dollar ten thousand dollars I don't
[14:56.320 --> 14:59.160]  know if that's cash or in Visa cards plus a trip for two to the voice
[14:59.160 --> 15:05.800]  finale in Los Angeles Amy would love that I bet she loves the voice I can't
[15:05.800 --> 15:11.440]  help but feel that ultimately Comcast should be very like or anybody like that
[15:11.440 --> 15:16.920]  with a with a company with millions of customers all paying like a hundred to
[15:16.920 --> 15:21.680]  two hundred dollars a month for service that's you know it was like a one-time
[15:21.680 --> 15:25.840]  infrastructure layout to you know put the cable in the streets and through the
[15:25.840 --> 15:29.280]  polls and everything and everybody's houses I mean obviously you know there's to
[15:29.280 --> 15:33.400]  get from where nobody had cable in America to where everybody has cable
[15:33.400 --> 15:36.600]  running into their house that's an accomplishment right but that's all in the
[15:36.600 --> 15:41.440]  past it's all there now it just runs it should it should really just be like
[15:41.440 --> 15:47.640]  like a twenty five person company really just answering calls yeah just
[15:47.640 --> 15:51.520]  answering some calls and you know mostly mostly just you know field you know
[15:51.520 --> 15:55.000]  guys who go out in the field and troubleshoot problems and stuff like that like
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.280]  there's no real reason for Comcast to exist is a very large corporation well
[15:59.280 --> 16:03.240]  and that's the irony I remember gosh years ago you talking about wasn't that
[16:03.240 --> 16:07.720]  was a Comcast where they you had to get the special DRM card for your cable
[16:07.720 --> 16:12.360]  box oh yeah yeah yeah we came out and he brought one that didn't work exactly
[16:12.360 --> 16:20.720]  one and then he came back to it was it was a two cable card Tivo and he came
[16:20.720 --> 16:25.640]  out and it was like he had one at work and one that didn't and he's like I'm gonna
[16:25.640 --> 16:28.200]  go get some more cards and I was like well are they in your truck and he goes
[16:28.200 --> 16:33.760]  no no I gotta go and I have spare yeah and like the next time another and it
[16:33.760 --> 16:36.280]  was always a different guy wasn't like the same guy you're skipping the
[16:36.280 --> 16:38.840]  great part because then you didn't have to make a new appointment yeah I
[16:38.840 --> 16:42.800]  made a new appointment it's like what do you don't try that it's like I got
[16:42.800 --> 16:50.400]  some waiting for you no and ultimately a guy came and he had one I always was
[16:50.400 --> 16:54.360]  only two cards every time and I'd always say like well can you put on like on the
[16:54.360 --> 16:59.360]  third visit I was like can you please put down to tell the guy to bring a whole
[16:59.360 --> 17:03.200]  box full of these cards and he was like well we don't usually do that and I was
[17:03.200 --> 17:06.520]  like what do you think maybe you should this is the third one just bring a
[17:06.520 --> 17:09.800]  whole stack of them obviously some of these things work some of them half
[17:09.800 --> 17:14.200]  work and some don't work so we wound up with with the like on the third one
[17:14.200 --> 17:17.960]  we got a fully working cable card and then the second cable card got
[17:17.960 --> 17:22.320]  everything except HBO and I show time or whatever you know like whatever the
[17:22.320 --> 17:27.480]  page channels are premium stuff and I was like good enough so like every time we
[17:27.480 --> 17:33.040]  wanted to Tivo like an HBO show we'd have a 50% shot that it would be just a
[17:33.040 --> 17:38.840]  black screen for the hour of the broadcast so we just set up the Tivo I say we
[17:38.840 --> 17:43.240]  Amy's actually the Tivo runner of the house she set it up so that any of the
[17:43.240 --> 17:48.280]  HBO shows that we wanted we would she would just set the Tivo to record all of
[17:48.280 --> 17:52.280]  them you know like so like when the new episode of the Sopranos came out just
[17:52.280 --> 17:55.320]  came recording it over and over again because if you do you know and there's
[17:55.320 --> 17:59.160]  like eight copies of it on the Tivo one there's a good chance one of them is
[17:59.160 --> 18:03.400]  gonna work Xfinity it's all about improving your chances now we that was years
[18:03.400 --> 18:07.080]  ago we now have a new Tivo that I don't know what it's got some different
[18:07.080 --> 18:12.520]  kind of cable card right it's good now but the beauty part of your what you're
[18:12.520 --> 18:18.600]  describing here we get the 25 people answering funds is I mean I I I can
[18:18.600 --> 18:21.520]  not begin well first of all let's be honest you're not gonna I mean I'm
[18:21.520 --> 18:25.160]  gonna troubleshoot the shit out of everything that I can like I just sent you
[18:25.160 --> 18:28.360]  that Earl right right I know how to get to the Motorola surfboard I know how to
[18:28.360 --> 18:31.240]  go in and do things I know how to hack on this a little bit I know how to go
[18:31.240 --> 18:34.800]  unhook and re hook every cable and you know I I learned a long time ago not to
[18:34.800 --> 18:38.400]  be that guy if you do call but if I've reached completely reached the end of
[18:38.400 --> 18:41.120]  my rope I will I will you know you end up calling them and you go through the
[18:41.120 --> 18:44.840]  thing try and get you know pushed up to higher level tech support and stuff
[18:44.840 --> 18:49.520]  like that because everything apparently is a black box when it comes to doing
[18:49.520 --> 18:54.520]  anything with coaxial cable and the irony is that well first of all when they
[18:54.520 --> 18:59.200]  do send somebody out to your house you know whenever usually a week later it's a
[18:59.200 --> 19:03.680]  complete in my experience a complete crap shoot what you're gonna get yeah so
[19:03.680 --> 19:08.160]  like a lot of times you get like you know Bob Hoskins from Brazil and this guy
[19:08.160 --> 19:11.920]  comes out and is white you know F-150 and he's got a magnetic sign on the
[19:11.920 --> 19:15.640]  side it's like the equivalent of like holding a finger up for a mustache and I
[19:15.640 --> 19:18.960]  work for a Comcast he's got like a magnetic sign that goes it's okay it's
[19:18.960 --> 19:22.680]  cool I'm actually Comcast even though he's not he's a contractor and these
[19:22.680 --> 19:27.000]  guys come out there and what's funny is like every fifth visit you know like
[19:27.000 --> 19:30.600]  every two years I get somebody else to come out for some reason there'll be
[19:30.600 --> 19:34.840]  like there's been like probably eight people that came out and made a big mess
[19:34.840 --> 19:38.160]  and then every few years somebody comes out and cleans up the mess this woman
[19:38.160 --> 19:41.200]  this awesome this awesome Gulf War veteran woman came out and she's like I can
[19:41.200 --> 19:44.320]  tell you why it's not working because these dingus is just keep hanging up all
[19:44.320 --> 19:46.920]  these junctions you realize you're losing this much of a percentage of it I'm
[19:46.920 --> 19:51.120]  like wow you're magic she's like yeah I just took out about 40 feet of cable
[19:51.120 --> 19:54.000]  that's why you're getting a signal because they just kept spaghetti and new
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.760]  stuff in they don't want to drill a hole oh my gosh I'm getting a special
[19:56.760 --> 20:00.160]  form for that but you know it really depends on what you get there could be
[20:00.160 --> 20:03.520]  people who come out and just don't have the slightest idea how to fix anything
[20:03.520 --> 20:07.240]  with the most trivial thing another people who like you get like $500 worth of
[20:07.240 --> 20:11.480]  service problem I've had the similar experience exact same where sometimes you
[20:11.480 --> 20:16.360]  know you get you get the Robert DeNiro character from Brazil who actually
[20:16.360 --> 20:21.600]  knows how to fix things and I remember one time it was the same thing where
[20:21.600 --> 20:25.400]  there was a guy who was like testing our signal outside the house and he was
[20:25.400 --> 20:28.920]  like it's pretty good out there yeah you know you know like he was good enough
[20:28.920 --> 20:32.760]  for even even that he just had pretty good is like it's all right because but
[20:32.760 --> 20:36.080]  here at your in your living room this is is terrible you lose something's
[20:36.080 --> 20:40.120]  going on so he like I don't know it was like some kind of terrible spider web of
[20:40.120 --> 20:44.600]  junctions I had no idea I thought it was a zero in one thing but apparently you
[20:44.600 --> 20:48.760]  lose a lot of I guess decibels or whatever of strength yeah with each you know
[20:48.760 --> 20:52.440]  however many feet of coax you add it can actually be a huge effect and if
[20:52.440 --> 20:55.840]  that's there if the one the one old flip back to the zero and just won't be
[20:55.840 --> 20:59.840]  enough to drive your router right you know those those those like coaxial like
[20:59.840 --> 21:05.920]  why splitters y'all God yes yeah sure do he came up he came up from like our
[21:05.920 --> 21:09.800]  downstairs like our basement with with this one and he's he's this is what he
[21:09.800 --> 21:14.920]  said he took out and it had like it was like it was literally rusted it was it
[21:14.920 --> 21:18.840]  was rusty and he goes well I took this out and he goes it wasn't even doing
[21:18.840 --> 21:22.080]  anything it wasn't there wasn't you know like the split wasn't going anywhere
[21:22.080 --> 21:26.040]  it was just somebody somebody used it to you know string more cable
[21:26.040 --> 21:30.880]  together we came on one day came upstairs everything was dead dead dead
[21:30.880 --> 21:35.160]  the bill is paid everything was dead I went downstairs and I did my usual
[21:35.160 --> 21:39.000]  troubleshooting on the incredibly ancient equipment and it was really obvious
[21:39.000 --> 21:44.840]  that someone had had basically had cut the cable to our house and then wide
[21:44.840 --> 21:48.840]  off the cable to go into our neighbor's house and at first I thought it might be
[21:48.840 --> 21:52.040]  our our mookie neighbors wanting to watch the Super Bowl for free or something
[21:52.040 --> 21:56.360]  like that but I called I called Comcast and what it became apparent once we
[21:56.360 --> 21:59.720]  got one of the actual useful people out there was that that was just what
[21:59.720 --> 22:02.360]  they thought needed to be done they thought oh we don't need this cable
[22:02.360 --> 22:05.120]  over here obviously there's only one house here we'll cut this one off and
[22:05.120 --> 22:08.640]  just put this one here so they cut off literally physically cut off the cable
[22:08.640 --> 22:12.960]  and then reconnected it to our neighbors like you know like in like a 1920s
[22:12.960 --> 22:19.680]  switchboard I think I've told this story but it was many many years ago but
[22:19.680 --> 22:24.880]  when I the best cable experience I've ever had was when I was in college I had
[22:24.880 --> 22:29.720]  lived like in my last few years in college we had a big big six bedroom apartment
[22:29.720 --> 22:36.120]  in West Philly and six you know six roommates everybody got a room and we called
[22:36.120 --> 22:41.320]  to get the the cable service and the guy who came out was I want to say
[22:41.320 --> 22:46.920]  Russian but you know it's some kind of Eastern European accent and he's
[22:46.920 --> 22:51.440]  hooking up our cable up you know on the up and up and I forget who it was it
[22:51.440 --> 22:55.640]  wasn't me but one of my roommates said something to him about
[22:55.640 --> 23:00.600]  it's not talking a little bit of the code yeah you just said yeah for any extra
[23:00.600 --> 23:05.960]  services he got he was like he goes I've heard about there's some ways that
[23:05.960 --> 23:11.720]  you here's what I remember I don't want to say his name because I don't want
[23:11.720 --> 23:20.760]  to embarrass him but he he call him smoker channels he was like yeah you're
[23:20.760 --> 23:32.400]  just a thing you get the smoker channels for free and the guy just stops and I
[23:32.400 --> 23:36.280]  thought at first when he stopped that it was like like when you offer a cop a
[23:36.280 --> 23:39.760]  bribe and then all of a sudden it's like now you're in trouble for for giving
[23:39.760 --> 23:44.800]  a cop a bribe and the guy says and said would you you know when you like
[23:44.800 --> 23:49.560]  something like that and he's and and we're all like yeah yeah what what would
[23:49.560 --> 23:53.120]  it take and he goes he goes well I could come back to I don't work to my
[23:53.120 --> 23:59.560]  because I could come back here tomorrow and and do this on my own time and it
[23:59.560 --> 24:02.960]  would and I forget what he asked for I don't know like 200 bucks or
[24:02.960 --> 24:08.320]  something and we all agreed yeah so right there on the spot he called in and we
[24:08.320 --> 24:12.440]  heard him he called into like his supervisor and said yeah I'm at whatever our
[24:12.440 --> 24:16.440]  address was he goes yeah they they no longer want servers yeah they don't want
[24:16.440 --> 24:20.920]  any they can't afford it they they don't want any things so just cancel it you
[24:20.920 --> 24:24.120]  know shut them off and he goes all right I'll see you guys tomorrow and it
[24:24.120 --> 24:28.160]  comes back the next day and he's just like in street clothes and he had like a
[24:28.160 --> 24:32.560]  box he was it was like he he'd been brought everything we didn't have to do
[24:32.560 --> 24:37.040]  anything he just had like a cable box and he went out and climbed up like the
[24:37.040 --> 24:41.560]  pole outside our apartment and next thing you know we had a cable service that
[24:41.560 --> 24:46.760]  got us everything and we never paid it we never paid anything for it we've
[24:46.760 --> 24:50.760]  paid the guy like 200 bucks one time and then that would have been that would
[24:50.760 --> 24:53.080]  have been back then even that would have been like at least 50 bucks a month
[24:53.080 --> 24:58.320]  something like that I might be slightly misremember it might be that we
[24:58.320 --> 25:02.560]  maybe we had to I don't think we paid anything I think we paid nothing we just had
[25:02.560 --> 25:05.320]  it all that's how it worked but that's how it worked back then I mean if you had
[25:05.320 --> 25:08.800]  the right box with the I mean it was also it was all physical stuff I mean I
[25:08.800 --> 25:11.920]  remember around that same time maybe a little earlier there was an old trick
[25:11.920 --> 25:15.160]  with the kind of cable boxes we had for maybe cable vision or whatever it was
[25:15.160 --> 25:19.600]  where you take a certain kind of cardboard there was a certain thickness and
[25:19.600 --> 25:25.480]  you fold it on the end about certain amount like a half an inch and you slide
[25:25.480 --> 25:29.720]  it into the top of the cable box in the little crack all right the little you
[25:29.720 --> 25:33.920]  know and you pull it back and suddenly you get all the smoker channels you get
[25:33.920 --> 25:37.880]  everything really yeah one that basically meant you get showtime HBS and
[25:37.880 --> 25:42.080]  Max and whatever the other one was yeah movie channel we got everything we got
[25:42.080 --> 25:46.160]  pay-per-view you're kidding no we got because I remember I used to be in the
[25:46.160 --> 25:49.480]  boxing you know not like seriously but like that was expensive those things are
[25:49.480 --> 25:53.280]  expensive yeah like Tyson it was like you know in the 90s and Tyson was still
[25:53.280 --> 25:58.040]  fighting I the one I remember specifically we even you know we used to invite
[25:58.040 --> 26:01.480]  people over because you know you couldn't watch those things without you know
[26:01.480 --> 26:04.040]  without paying but we I remember the one remember the one it was crazy it was
[26:04.040 --> 26:07.520]  like boxing was like pro wrestling back then it was the one where the fan man it
[26:07.520 --> 26:12.400]  was an outdoor fight and the guy on a parachute came into the ring in the
[26:12.400 --> 26:16.680]  middle of the fight remember that oh no I don't remember that this is this like
[26:16.680 --> 26:20.160]  really happened like in the middle of a Mike Tyson heavyweight bout the
[26:20.160 --> 26:25.080]  guy named fan man I don't know where his name came but he had like a parasail and
[26:25.080 --> 26:29.440]  he like came into the ring and they had to like stop the fight and beat this guy
[26:29.440 --> 26:32.320]  up and get him out before they resume the fight.
[26:32.320 --> 26:36.160]  Riddick Bow vs. Evander Holyfield all right it wasn't Tyson Holyfield
[26:36.160 --> 26:42.160]  look at that wow that was real and I had that we got that for free. He passed
[26:42.160 --> 26:46.360]  he passed in 2002 sorry to say oh that's it's fan man passed I didn't know that
[26:46.360 --> 26:50.960]  RIP fan man that wasn't that many years after it happened it was probably
[26:50.960 --> 26:58.640]  like what 95 96 he's a parachuteist and paraglet or pilot from Henderson
[26:58.640 --> 27:01.480]  Nevada known for his appearances his most famous appearance was the
[27:01.480 --> 27:04.960]  November 6 1993 boxing match between Evander Holyfield and Riddick Bow at
[27:04.960 --> 27:09.400]  Caesar's Palace and it made headlines when he used his powered paraglet or
[27:09.400 --> 27:16.520]  to fly into the arena eventually crashing into the ring damn oh man dogs chasing
[27:16.520 --> 27:21.080]  cats these dogs chasing cats you gotta fix the thing is the the cone that's
[27:21.080 --> 27:25.280]  standing up looks like it's fine it seems like it's a good one it seems like
[27:25.280 --> 27:28.160]  you would work on the 12 foot cone that have fallen over but you know I'm not
[27:28.160 --> 27:33.960]  an exfinity mechanic I want to take this take a break and I'm gonna thank our

[31:17.160 --> 31:20.600]  cool because it just works for a certain kind of brain like my brain

[31:26.920 --> 31:30.600]  like show me this cool thing it's it's very well curated
[31:30.600 --> 31:34.120]  that's exactly the same here I can't I can't make decisions
[31:34.120 --> 31:36.760]  I don't want to see the thirteen different shirts
[31:36.760 --> 31:40.680]  just show me one and then I'll give it a thumbs up or thumbs down
[31:40.680 --> 31:45.320]  exactly uh so my thanks to them no dogs no cats
[31:45.320 --> 31:49.080]  at need addition hmm I don't believe
[31:49.080 --> 31:54.680]  my goodness I've got uh you're you're Levi's 501 guy I am
[31:54.680 --> 31:58.360]  yeah me too so I've got four pairs of Levi's 501s that look like they fell off a
[31:58.360 --> 32:01.240]  hobo and I have exactly one pair of pants that fits me
[32:01.240 --> 32:04.280]  and they're from need like one pair of jeans that fits me it makes me
[32:04.280 --> 32:06.840]  realize what pants that fit feel like
[32:06.840 --> 32:10.600]  so I don't wear too much because they're a little bit jarring
[32:10.600 --> 32:14.760]  I have bones to pick with that I do wear Levi's 501 and a couple years ago I
[32:14.760 --> 32:17.560]  tried something else I think I got something I went to the
[32:17.560 --> 32:20.360]  got them from the gap or something I don't know but then they didn't work out
[32:20.360 --> 32:23.880]  either but my problem with them is they they're what I want is I just
[32:23.880 --> 32:27.560]  want the exact same jeans over and over again and and that you can't do that
[32:27.560 --> 32:32.520]  they're always changing the name of the the denim you know
[32:32.520 --> 32:36.120]  you know they've got 40 different names and styles of denim I just
[32:36.120 --> 32:39.160]  oh my god go to the Levi's site it's completely overwhelming
[32:39.160 --> 32:41.320]  right I was gonna try the same thing I was like okay I'm gonna find
[32:41.320 --> 32:44.760]  exactly this one get this skew by five of them
[32:44.760 --> 32:48.360]  and then rotate them for the next five years yeah I tried to do that and you
[32:48.360 --> 32:51.800]  can't couldn't the ones I bought the last time aren't there anymore
[32:51.800 --> 32:55.160]  and I bought them and also the sizes are different like I
[32:55.160 --> 32:58.840]  bought a new pair with the exact you know and even print the size right on the
[32:58.840 --> 33:02.040]  patch on the back and now there's got to I I learned this from a
[33:02.040 --> 33:05.720]  female friend of mine in college she's like whenever I go try on anything
[33:05.720 --> 33:08.280]  in a store especially if it's not like super expensive
[33:08.280 --> 33:11.080]  if it's anything that's like like you know
[33:11.080 --> 33:14.520]  anything that's not basically like evening wear
[33:14.520 --> 33:17.800]  take four into the dressing room and try them on in the same size I'm like you
[33:17.800 --> 33:20.120]  are high there's absolutely no difference and there's
[33:20.120 --> 33:23.960]  there totally is a difference and look no further go grab after the program
[33:23.960 --> 33:27.320]  go grab a bunch of pairs of five of ones and look what country they're made in
[33:27.320 --> 33:30.280]  so if you're wondering why I mean I've got some that are from
[33:30.280 --> 33:34.440]  Mexico I've got some that are from like Central America
[33:34.440 --> 33:38.280]  I mean in the just to say that it isn't like there's like this one lady in
[33:38.280 --> 33:41.080]  San Francisco that's making all these genes there's a lot of variation
[33:41.080 --> 33:43.640]  I bet the cotton is different in a lot of them
[33:43.640 --> 33:47.400]  you gotta try them on yeah but that's like what I
[33:47.400 --> 33:51.480]  I think you're exactly right but I hate it because that's not what I want to
[33:51.480 --> 33:55.320]  do that whole point of knowing my size and knowing that I want Levi's
[33:55.320 --> 33:58.920]  model 501 is I want to just order them online
[33:58.920 --> 34:01.160]  I buy clothes like other people by beer
[34:01.160 --> 34:04.360]  where I just I'll just go like American apparel white t-shirts boom send me a
[34:04.360 --> 34:06.680]  pack of those that's that's how I want it to be
[34:06.680 --> 34:10.520]  almost like a paper towel dispenser at my kids elementary school
[34:10.520 --> 34:14.200]  I want it to be so straightforward I buy exactly the same socks
[34:14.200 --> 34:17.560]  exactly the same shirts and then when they when they change for some reason
[34:17.560 --> 34:19.800]  you're like oh this got really this got a little too silky
[34:19.800 --> 34:22.760]  it seems really weird I feel really undermined by the brand
[34:22.760 --> 34:26.760]  yeah I feel like Steve Jobs sort of had it right where he
[34:26.760 --> 34:29.800]  where you know everybody thought it was sort of eccentric but where he was like
[34:29.800 --> 34:34.120]  this is it this I but he had that Japanese designer give him like 75 of those
[34:34.120 --> 34:38.280]  black shirts and that was it I think it's the smartest thing in the world
[34:38.280 --> 34:41.720]  I mean you just don't want to have to you shouldn't have to think about that
[34:41.720 --> 34:44.760]  stuff and if you're the problem is once you become a little eclectic
[34:44.760 --> 34:47.960]  then you kind of got to become really eclectic because you can't have like
[34:47.960 --> 34:52.040]  fucking clown shoes that you wear every day you've got to have some variation
[34:52.040 --> 34:56.360]  you know you had your driving muck he was the smart part was getting like 75 of
[34:56.360 --> 35:00.280]  them at once rather than say just get the 10 that you need and then as they
[35:00.280 --> 35:03.480]  wear out you'll get more because you can't trust that they're going to be
[35:03.480 --> 35:06.840]  there to get more you really got a reason also good reason to maintain your
[35:06.840 --> 35:10.200]  weight as you get older it is it's good motivation
[35:10.200 --> 35:15.000]  good motivation real-time follow-up the story of parachutus
[35:15.000 --> 35:19.720]  James Miller aka fan man is tragic you know he took his own life he was a
[35:19.720 --> 35:23.080]  young man took his own oh yeah that seemed unusual that he would
[35:23.080 --> 35:27.320]  pass away at that yeah that's that's
[35:27.880 --> 35:31.480]  but you know he had his he had his moment you know I suppose it's not
[35:31.480 --> 35:34.920]  surprising that the guy who parachuted live into a heavy weight
[35:34.920 --> 35:38.680]  title fight at Caesar's Palace had had some
[35:38.680 --> 35:41.720]  and mental health issues and I don't even mean to make fun of it I don't know
[35:41.720 --> 35:45.560]  you know I'm not you know what he did in a fight was funny him taking his
[35:45.560 --> 35:48.920]  life is is tragic but it's I suppose it's not that surprising
[35:48.920 --> 35:52.360]  if you read up on rock and rollin no you know about him
[35:52.360 --> 35:58.040]  no rainbow weight John 3 16 guy oh yeah yeah as a sports fan you should know
[35:58.040 --> 36:02.120]  he's he's he's had a lot of balls in the air over the years
[36:02.120 --> 36:06.360]  is he still around I don't remember I think you know it started it's
[36:06.360 --> 36:09.160]  but it's funny because in my head I think what are the two of the two
[36:09.160 --> 36:12.200]  characters you remember from early adulthood
[36:12.200 --> 36:15.400]  like that would be parodied on the Simpsons like out of sporting
[36:15.400 --> 36:17.640]  effect well there's a guy in the clown wig
[36:17.640 --> 36:20.600]  and there's the guy who holds up to John 3 16 sign
[36:20.600 --> 36:23.400]  and the first amazing thing is that that was the same guy
[36:23.400 --> 36:27.800]  he changed tack at one point and he went from rainbow wig to John 3 16
[36:27.800 --> 36:31.880]  so that was a same guy but I think at some point it ended again as
[36:31.880 --> 36:35.800]  all of a sudden making this really sad I think it I think he ended up with some
[36:35.800 --> 36:42.200]  kind of hostage situation at some point and he you know got got taken away
[36:42.200 --> 36:46.040]  so for those of you who don't know this guy what was his name
[36:46.040 --> 36:49.560]  I remember rock and rollin rainbow
[36:49.560 --> 36:53.720]  right rollin Stewart there he is oh yeah
[36:53.720 --> 36:56.200]  yeah yeah yeah rollin Stewart how to spell rollin
[36:56.200 --> 37:05.880]  send it on the L.E.N. Stewart he was a guy who would he would he would obtain
[37:05.880 --> 37:11.560]  tickets for sporting events that were optimally placed so that he would be on
[37:11.560 --> 37:16.040]  TV like you know he was he knew which tickets to buy
[37:16.040 --> 37:19.720]  that would be within the camera angle that you know would be frequent and
[37:19.720 --> 37:23.080]  he uh what did he do first the rainbow wig
[37:23.080 --> 37:25.960]  yeah started out with the rainbow but but it's sort of like Marlin's guy we were
[37:25.960 --> 37:29.160]  like tell me more about this guy like how is it he's always
[37:29.160 --> 37:33.000]  where he's at so many games in so many places and he's always he always
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.240]  ends up on camera and then of course that enough to
[37:35.240 --> 37:38.920]  became a bit started out with the rainbow afro wig
[37:38.920 --> 37:41.560]  and then later on he went to the uh John 3 16
[37:41.560 --> 37:44.280]  all right John then he used to I remember he thought it was always football
[37:44.280 --> 37:46.840]  game I remember I he probably did everything but I remember seeing him on
[37:46.840 --> 37:50.360]  football games and he would he must have had
[37:50.360 --> 37:55.160]  a lot of money because you know it's they were expensive seats near the front
[37:55.160 --> 37:58.280]  and he had to travel a lot because it wasn't like
[37:58.280 --> 38:01.960]  oh he he was a guy in Kansas City and he was always at Kansas City Chiefs
[38:01.960 --> 38:05.000]  games no he was like every he was like at the the game of the week every
[38:05.000 --> 38:08.280]  week wherever it was it says I love Wikipedia
[38:08.280 --> 38:11.880]  his first major appearance was at the 1977 NBA Finals
[38:11.880 --> 38:15.800]  by the time of the 1979 MLB all-star game broadcasters actively tried to
[38:15.800 --> 38:18.280]  avoid showing it then you get him here behind the goal
[38:18.280 --> 38:22.040]  football goal pose Olympic medal stands Augusta National Golf Club 1982
[38:22.040 --> 38:25.480]  Indianapolis 500 behind the pits of Gordon John cock
[38:25.480 --> 38:28.760]  and eventually he got commercials and stuff but you know
[38:28.760 --> 38:31.720]  I'm surprised that he got he got in at Augusta
[38:31.720 --> 38:34.520]  because Augusta sense it seems like type of place where
[38:34.520 --> 38:38.200]  they have the masters yeah that's the masters they wouldn't hesitate to
[38:38.200 --> 38:43.560]  you know take a guy out maybe at a green jacket like a green blazer
[38:43.560 --> 38:49.880]  in a rainbow wig so he there like that he's like it was like the old time
[38:49.880 --> 38:54.520]  predecessor to this year is Marlon's man who I have to admit I got
[38:54.520 --> 39:00.040]  I got very into this year with did you watch any of the baseball
[39:00.040 --> 39:04.440]  he know I did yeah it was it was absolutely fascinating and so this guy and
[39:04.440 --> 39:07.800]  I know this whole backstory behind this and he like but it was pretty amazing
[39:07.800 --> 39:11.080]  because I can't remember where it started out but it was for some reason I
[39:11.080 --> 39:14.040]  think obviously it was most striking in the Kansas the games that were in
[39:14.040 --> 39:19.800]  Kansas City because it's complete solid cerulean sea of blue
[39:19.800 --> 39:24.520]  I mean it's just solid blue and then this one guy in a traffic
[39:24.520 --> 39:28.920]  cone orange jersey this is Marlon's on it and he is right
[39:28.920 --> 39:32.200]  effing behind home plate I mean he's right there and
[39:32.200 --> 39:34.520]  he does this great thing we're right when the pitcher starting to throw
[39:34.520 --> 39:38.440]  he stands up so you can see this Marlon's jersey
[39:38.440 --> 39:41.960]  he I don't know what this problem it seemed to me like he couldn't stand still
[39:41.960 --> 39:46.120]  like I am a baseball man so I was mostly watching the game he had piles
[39:46.120 --> 39:51.320]  I don't know if it was carvocular he didn't seem to be paying attention to the game
[39:51.320 --> 39:54.840]  on a regular basis at times he was but there were he would chat up his
[39:54.840 --> 40:00.600]  seatmates nearby sometimes yeah yeah he you know again like you said it was
[40:00.600 --> 40:04.600]  he was quite incongruous in the games in Kansas City and hats off to the
[40:04.600 --> 40:09.000]  people of Kansas City for their their like I don't know of how many thousand
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.360]  forty five fifty thousand people fit in that stadium and I would say
[40:12.360 --> 40:15.480]  forty nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine and then we're wearing
[40:15.480 --> 40:19.640]  royals blue it was an impressive sight uh
[40:19.640 --> 40:22.840]  you know I think that spirit too I mean that was that was a great series and they
[40:22.840 --> 40:24.840]  they fought hard and those fans really
[40:24.840 --> 40:30.040]  man they let that place up yeah it's it was great and but this one guy
[40:30.040 --> 40:35.640]  went a bright flaming orange marlin's jagged and hat really stuck out and he
[40:35.640 --> 40:39.720]  literally right behind home plate I mean like maybe like out of
[40:39.720 --> 40:44.520]  the forty five thousand seats like he was always in maybe one of the two seats
[40:44.520 --> 40:47.720]  that he would be most visible behind the batter like there's only like
[40:47.720 --> 40:50.920]  there's one on the left and one on the right where where you're that visible and
[40:50.920 --> 40:53.960]  he was in that seat all the time I don't understand how can you
[40:53.960 --> 40:57.800]  guarantee how can you buy that I don't I somebody I think Jason Snell sent me an
[40:57.800 --> 41:00.920]  article about this and I looked at it briefly I think he's like a medical
[41:00.920 --> 41:04.760]  professional like some kind of a dentist and like he gets these tickets
[41:04.760 --> 41:08.760]  somehow but I mean if you think about all the work that goes into that
[41:08.760 --> 41:11.240]  it was in it was in San Francisco too
[41:11.240 --> 41:13.960]  right right he was yeah he let's be clear
[41:13.960 --> 41:18.040]  he was in San Francisco for a few games then he went to Kansas
[41:18.040 --> 41:22.040]  for a few games and so forth and came back it's I mean it's
[41:22.040 --> 41:27.000]  he was a real dedication yeah and those are I you know and who knows if
[41:27.000 --> 41:30.840]  I want to look at like a thousand dollars oh I think for the world series it
[41:30.840 --> 41:34.440]  was a lot more I went on stub hubs because I got curious and I was like well what
[41:34.440 --> 41:41.640]  would it cost and and like the seats in the what's the is it AT&T
[41:41.640 --> 41:45.880]  what's the the Giants that's what it is this week yeah yeah well the Giants ballpark
[41:45.880 --> 41:52.120]  AT&T Park yeah yeah formerly SBC formerly Pac Bell
[41:52.120 --> 41:57.880]  uh it it the ones there that close right behind on plate were thousands of
[41:57.880 --> 42:01.400]  dollars on stub hub and in fact it's like everything on stub hub I mean it's
[42:01.400 --> 42:05.080]  you know it's it's a it's a it's a negotiating thing it's a stub hub like a
[42:05.080 --> 42:09.080]  kind of gray market is like eBay for tickets or something yeah yeah it's a
[42:09.080 --> 42:12.760]  mate you've never used it it's amazing it's truly amazing it's a great
[42:12.760 --> 42:17.560]  great service um where you can resell tickets and they automate it
[42:17.560 --> 42:21.720]  and they they they totally you can you know like they stand behind every
[42:21.720 --> 42:24.760]  ticket that they sell so you don't feel like you're it's not like eBay
[42:24.760 --> 42:27.960]  like stub hub because you know like with eBay if somebody rips you off
[42:27.960 --> 42:33.800]  you they have like a mediation but stub hub sort of stands behind it
[42:33.800 --> 42:37.640]  it's like stub hub buys the ticket from the person and then you're buying the
[42:37.640 --> 42:40.920]  ticket from stub hub oh my gosh that's fantastic
[42:40.920 --> 42:44.200]  so really what you would hope eBay would pay power originally kind of
[42:44.200 --> 42:47.640]  seemed like an s almost s grow but like really hands on they
[42:47.640 --> 42:53.320]  take it and make sure yeah and they and they have offices physical
[42:53.320 --> 42:58.360]  retail establishments and a lot of I a lot of major cities most major cities
[42:58.360 --> 43:03.000]  so if you buy tickets at the last minute you can go pick them up
[43:03.000 --> 43:09.240]  they're like I I bought tickets for a Yankees game in in August for the it
[43:09.240 --> 43:12.760]  was Derek Jeter day and I didn't know if we were going to go and I bought them
[43:12.760 --> 43:20.280]  the day before and it was so easy I we were going to be in in New York anyway
[43:20.280 --> 43:23.480]  this is why I bought the tickets on for a thing on Saturday
[43:23.480 --> 43:27.960]  so we're staying over and just there's a place in midtown you just go in
[43:27.960 --> 43:32.920]  and you show them your ID and then they just handed me an envelope
[43:32.920 --> 43:38.520]  with the tickets that's amazing yeah I bought them like you know a day before
[43:38.520 --> 43:41.640]  but then I have to wait I mean it's a lot it's certainly must have been a lot of
[43:41.640 --> 43:45.320]  dough I guess maybe he got them for free or discounted or something but it's a
[43:45.320 --> 43:48.840]  lot of medication no there's no way he had to buy them out
[43:48.840 --> 43:51.800]  but it's just crazy because somebody has that seat if there's like a season
[43:51.800 --> 43:55.080]  ticket holder and you're like a fan of the giants why would you give up that
[43:55.080 --> 43:58.840]  great seat unless he really made an offer you couldn't refuse
[43:58.840 --> 44:02.760]  and it's just so funny because it's for his purposes
[44:02.760 --> 44:07.400]  it's not just like he wants a good seat he wants to be he clearly wants to be on
[44:07.400 --> 44:11.880]  TV there's only like three or four seats I mean into pound for pound he's on
[44:11.880 --> 44:17.080]  screen more than anybody but maybe the pitcher and the catcher yeah you know
[44:17.080 --> 44:20.280]  what I mean if you think about it I mean that guy is except for occasionally
[44:20.280 --> 44:23.640]  like he might be obscured by the umpire for a second but he seems to have a
[44:23.640 --> 44:26.840]  really good sense of like where to be to make sure he's on camera
[44:26.840 --> 44:31.320]  yeah definitely it seems like it you know and it's and it makes a big like
[44:31.320 --> 44:34.600]  even being in the front row makes such a big for his purposes makes such a
[44:34.600 --> 44:38.760]  big difference compared to being in the second row yeah
[44:38.760 --> 44:40.840]  it's like something from a different age though because if you think about
[44:40.840 --> 44:44.040]  guys like the like the parasailing guy or rock and rollin or or
[44:44.040 --> 44:48.600]  marlin's guy I mean you know it used to be really hard to be famous
[44:48.600 --> 44:52.680]  yeah you know it took a lot of work to be famous you you know you had to have
[44:52.680 --> 44:56.920]  a publisher for a book you had to have an agent to like try and even like
[44:56.920 --> 45:01.080]  beg to get you on TV it's just like today there's there's so many more
[45:01.080 --> 45:05.800]  avenues for becoming slightly famous that I kind of admire the
[45:05.800 --> 45:10.280]  grunt work you know on the ground of a medical professional who decides to
[45:10.280 --> 45:15.160]  jet between cities to to be on TV in the background
[45:15.160 --> 45:19.400]  it's it's wacky world you know the the I'm sure you know this because you've
[45:19.400 --> 45:22.600]  got to know them too that the royals tried to buy them out of those seats
[45:22.600 --> 45:27.160]  are you kidding you didn't notice that no the after the first game the
[45:27.160 --> 45:31.240]  Kansas City Royals or you know like the the organization approached him
[45:31.240 --> 45:36.200]  and said you know we we we you know we'd like you to move
[45:36.200 --> 45:39.800]  we will offer you will trade you for this these tickets you already had for this
[45:39.800 --> 45:44.200]  seat will give you a luxury box or you know a seat in one of the luxury boxes
[45:44.200 --> 45:48.840]  and you know you'll get the full I don't know you know food and beverage
[45:48.840 --> 45:53.720]  whatever please please give up your seat and he was like not you know
[45:53.720 --> 45:57.240]  and he you know declined because his whole goal you know that was the whole
[45:57.240 --> 46:00.360]  point I don't I don't I think that I don't think they quite understood
[46:00.360 --> 46:04.920]  the psychology of the guy that the psychopathy you know that he's lucky he
[46:04.920 --> 46:08.200]  was looking at a floating in whatever I guess the Kansas City River
[46:08.200 --> 46:11.480]  that's that's I could see them getting pretty miffed about that
[46:11.480 --> 46:14.440]  you need to think about what that ad space costs for all those you know the
[46:14.440 --> 46:18.040]  ads that are green screen back there and all the
[46:18.040 --> 46:21.480]  kind of as they say today optics of like how you present
[46:21.480 --> 46:24.520]  you know your brand it must have been super annoying to them
[46:24.520 --> 46:26.920]  yeah it makes me wonder how many people that they're going to be inspired by
[46:26.920 --> 46:31.400]  the guy and then if it's kind of start like a resurgence in
[46:31.400 --> 46:38.040]  you know yeah what would you call it a stick out a guy you know
[46:38.040 --> 46:40.920]  yeah yeah I mean you know everybody needs a project
[46:40.920 --> 46:43.640]  it's important to stay busy you know I should get older
[46:43.640 --> 46:46.600]  but it's like you never really notice the people there there are always
[46:46.600 --> 46:50.440]  people behind home plate or behind the end zone you know there's always fans in
[46:50.440 --> 46:53.640]  front row and you just never notice them really I mean I guess everyone's
[46:53.640 --> 46:56.600]  know why you see Jack Nicholson at a Lakers game or something like that
[46:56.600 --> 47:01.880]  show it but you know you just don't notice the fans until they're
[47:01.880 --> 47:06.760]  wearing bright orange marbles I had an uneasy moment in one game
[47:06.760 --> 47:10.120]  that made me feel really old there was this I'm guessing probably the greatest
[47:10.120 --> 47:13.640]  dad in the world that had brought his kids to the game in Kansas City
[47:13.640 --> 47:17.400]  but there was this probably like 11 year old girl sitting in like the fifth
[47:17.400 --> 47:22.680]  row and I was like man it's like 11 15 she's she's not pretty late for
[47:22.680 --> 47:25.480]  get her age and I was hoping the game would end because you know it was a
[47:25.480 --> 47:29.560]  school night you don't think about it's like you're dad taking you in the
[47:29.560 --> 47:34.280]  world series you come an old guy you start thinking about bedtime
[47:34.280 --> 47:39.720]  what if she has a math test tomorrow exactly is your kid still a night out
[47:39.720 --> 47:45.320]  yeah he is he's a natural born and as soon as Saturday hits
[47:45.320 --> 47:50.280]  he you know he's uh you know school starts at 8 a.m. you know Monday Tuesday
[47:50.280 --> 47:53.000]  you know right through Friday and then soon as Saturday comes he sleeps
[47:53.000 --> 47:59.480]  still noon no kidding wow man I hate that day like savings time
[47:59.480 --> 48:02.920]  I didn't jump on this bandwagon but man I'm so relieved when that ends it
[48:02.920 --> 48:06.760]  makes our life so much easier I couldn't disagree more
[48:06.760 --> 48:12.360]  no you don't like the savings time uh yeah I don't like that it's like
[48:12.360 --> 48:15.640]  it's true it's very hard to get my kid to go to sleep
[48:15.640 --> 48:18.680]  when it's like even 8 30 and it's still light outside now you're saying
[48:18.680 --> 48:22.440]  you you're pro daylight savings time you like the uh extra daylight at night
[48:22.440 --> 48:25.560]  I do hold on but that's I mean it's thank a sponsor and we'll go with it
[48:25.560 --> 48:27.560]  because that that was the whole thing I wanted to talk about
[48:27.560 --> 48:29.720]  I'd love to go head to head on this I think this is some
[48:29.720 --> 48:33.240]  American needs to hear people have very strong feelings about this
[48:33.240 --> 48:37.480]  John uh our second sponsor is our good friends at
[48:37.480 --> 48:40.680]  Warby Parker and you guys know Warby Parker that's the
[48:40.680 --> 48:46.040]  independent eye glass eyewear company um that was founded
[48:46.040 --> 48:50.040]  simply on the basis that buying eyeglasses should not
[48:50.040 --> 48:54.120]  cost an arm and a leg uh shouldn't have to pay 300 bucks just for a regular
[48:54.120 --> 48:57.160]  pair of glasses and like we were talking about with the Levi's before
[48:57.160 --> 49:00.680]  you ought to be able to buy them right there online and just have it be easy
[49:00.680 --> 49:06.040]  and not have to go and do a stupid store and waste a whole day
[49:06.280 --> 49:09.320]  Warby Parker if you haven't heard what you do is you go to their website they have a
[49:09.320 --> 49:13.160]  whole bunch of glasses to choose from you pick a bunch that you like
[49:13.160 --> 49:16.280]  pick different ones then they send them to your house
[49:16.280 --> 49:19.800]  for free just empty without you know many kind of prescription lens in them or
[49:19.800 --> 49:23.320]  whatever and you can try them on see if you like them
[49:23.320 --> 49:26.440]  you know see if there's something stupid on the uh the sides that you didn't
[49:26.440 --> 49:29.240]  notice when you were looking at them straight on uh
[49:29.240 --> 49:31.720]  you know I mean it's like you're making fun of me
[49:31.720 --> 49:36.920]  no I'm a sneaky pizza I love your sneaky pizza uh
[49:36.920 --> 49:40.200]  but I'm saying I'm the type of person where I would I would ordinarily think
[49:40.200 --> 49:44.040]  I'm never gonna buy eyeglasses online because I have to see them in person I
[49:44.040 --> 49:47.880]  cannot judge this just by pictures with that you don't have to do that
[49:47.880 --> 49:51.080]  you judge them online looking at the pictures just to have them
[49:51.080 --> 49:54.200]  sent to your house then you get five of them and you can actually sit there and
[49:54.200 --> 49:58.600]  examine them in your own hands uh you pick the one you like
[49:58.600 --> 50:02.600]  and then boom a couple days later in they come with your
[50:02.600 --> 50:09.000]  prescription uh lenses in place um they also
[50:09.000 --> 50:12.680]  there's a they they do a great great thing and here's the thing they start
[50:12.680 --> 50:16.440]  at just 95 bucks you go to warbyparker.com
[50:16.440 --> 50:20.280]  and they start at 95 bucks they have showrooms in some cities I think
[50:20.280 --> 50:23.880]  New York has it to San Francisco have one I don't so I don't I don't know of
[50:23.880 --> 50:27.400]  that I've I've done the home trial in several times and it's
[50:27.400 --> 50:31.080]  amazing home trials you should never know that's the thing I remember one time
[50:31.080 --> 50:34.040]  million years ago I went to well I won't say the name but it was a site where you
[50:34.040 --> 50:37.880]  could go and like upload a picture of yourself and try the glasses online
[50:37.880 --> 50:41.160]  and then I got the glasses and then I'm like clown glasses I had no idea of the
[50:41.160 --> 50:44.840]  actual like you know you can't tell until you put them on your actual
[50:44.840 --> 50:50.680]  stupid face all right there's just no way so here's the other thing though um
[50:50.680 --> 50:53.800]  they for every pair of glasses that they sell
[50:53.800 --> 50:58.440]  they distribute a pair to someone need around the world they've partnered with
[50:58.440 --> 51:04.360]  non-profits there's one called Vision Spring but that's it 15% of the
[51:04.360 --> 51:07.960]  world population a billion people around the world
[51:07.960 --> 51:13.240]  lack access to prescription glasses so if anybody out there who has bad
[51:13.240 --> 51:17.640]  vision in my my uncorrected vision is at this point in my life
[51:17.640 --> 51:21.160]  absolutely horrible like I would be I don't even know if I could cross the
[51:21.160 --> 51:25.960]  street if you think about what that would be like not to have glasses I
[51:25.960 --> 51:30.440]  mean I I don't know how I would even function I mean the only thing I could I
[51:30.440 --> 51:33.240]  can see about six inches in front of my face uncorrected so
[51:33.240 --> 51:35.880]  think about the fact that there's a billion people worldwide you don't have
[51:35.880 --> 51:39.960]  access to glasses and you know like if you were a kid how you couldn't even see
[51:39.960 --> 51:43.480]  how you're gonna learn anything so they're doing a great thing every time they
[51:43.480 --> 51:47.240]  sell a pair of glasses they send one to people in need I think that's a
[51:47.240 --> 51:49.800]  huge part of it and it doesn't mean you know the prices aren't
[51:49.800 --> 51:52.440]  jacked up it's not like you're paying double you're paying less than you would
[51:52.440 --> 51:59.400]  pay at and you know typical eyeglass place all other glasses include
[51:59.400 --> 52:02.760]  anti-reflective anti-glare coating there's no additional cost for that
[52:02.760 --> 52:06.840]  no upsell and stuff like that everything comes with a really nice case
[52:06.840 --> 52:11.960]  cleaning cloth everything you want stuff like that really cool kit it's it's
[52:11.960 --> 52:14.440]  great stuff we have I don't know I've lost track now of how many of
[52:14.440 --> 52:18.120]  Warby Parker glasses we've got here in the Gruber household
[52:18.120 --> 52:24.040]  sunglasses everything you might want and here's the thing this is new they
[52:24.040 --> 52:28.360]  have got progressive I think it's new progressive lenses starting at 295
[52:28.360 --> 52:33.400]  including the frames now progressives this is for my demographic now
[52:33.400 --> 52:37.960]  are that's where you have a distant prescription at the top of the lens
[52:37.960 --> 52:43.080]  I've got that and a transition to a reading lens near the lens's bottom
[52:43.080 --> 52:47.000]  and it's there's not like a hard line in between them that that says bifocal it's
[52:47.000 --> 52:51.160]  just I don't know I don't know how they do it they call it a digital free form
[52:51.160 --> 52:56.520]  lens which is the most advanced progressive technology it's applied
[52:56.520 --> 53:00.120]  digitally with a computer so the design is more precise than traditional
[53:00.120 --> 53:06.280]  models of progressives so they got that that's that's where I'm
[53:06.280 --> 53:11.640]  at my life with glasses so anyway here's where you go to find out more go to
[53:11.640 --> 53:19.240]  Warby Parker dot com slash the talk show Warby Parker dot com slash the talk

[53:31.720 --> 53:37.800]  with your lenses so why not all right daylight savings time
[53:37.800 --> 53:42.280]  look at you don't do a quick check in and have you checked on your cable
[53:42.280 --> 53:46.040]  just curious if the guy reflects the code
[53:46.040 --> 53:48.840]  hold on let me see
[53:49.240 --> 53:54.200]  uh all right if this actually works it's it's gonna be my blood
[53:54.200 --> 53:58.040]  I didn't get a text from them so I'm I'm not on it's a one-time text so you're
[53:58.040 --> 54:01.560]  only gonna get it with you if you're plugged in oh you know what though
[54:01.560 --> 54:06.360]  now I'm on my this die I was smart enough not to do it on the machine where
[54:06.360 --> 54:13.560]  that was recording our our call on uh but it looks like it is working
[54:13.560 --> 54:18.440]  yeah hey muscle top no text from them maybe they're not maybe they're not
[54:18.440 --> 54:22.040]  gonna keep slugging along this way yeah wow we can keep on
[54:22.040 --> 54:28.040]  yeah I mean I can't I say if it ain't broke don't fix it
[54:28.040 --> 54:32.360]  if the cone falls over and it's not hurting anybody just leave it there yeah
[54:32.360 --> 54:37.960]  what's that dog ever catches that cat
[54:37.960 --> 54:41.480]  all right so daylight savings time
[54:43.000 --> 54:46.280]  so you you're you're opposed to it
[54:46.280 --> 54:48.760]  and because of the summer months
[54:48.760 --> 54:52.520]  where it packs the daylight at I see I feel like we've got the whole thing
[54:52.520 --> 54:56.760]  backwards I feel like I could totally get behind
[54:56.760 --> 55:00.920]  uh because we it's not even like a six-month six-month thing anymore I thought it
[55:00.920 --> 55:03.960]  used to be but and I know they're always they changed everything around it's
[55:03.960 --> 55:07.880]  real confusing it's very confusing and I don't think it's it starts
[55:07.880 --> 55:12.280]  later and ends later now I know they changed it I believe so that it ends
[55:12.280 --> 55:17.240]  after Halloween right on purpose to to make it safer for kids which is great
[55:17.240 --> 55:22.520]  but then I think it starts later too is that right I don't know
[55:22.520 --> 55:26.680]  I'm not quite sure about that but uh
[55:26.680 --> 55:30.920]  I it but the but the fact is though that there's more of the year
[55:30.920 --> 55:35.000]  that daylight savings time than there is that standard time
[55:35.000 --> 55:39.000]  hmm right oh no it's I'm sorry I take it back they moved it back it's
[55:39.000 --> 55:42.440]  so the next one 2014 it started March 9th
[55:42.440 --> 55:45.560]  ends November 2nd wow you're totally right December
[55:45.560 --> 55:50.920]  wow right so it's really just it's just November
[55:50.920 --> 55:55.320]  December so two so far yeah three-quarters of the year something like that
[55:55.320 --> 55:59.800]  yeah yeah maybe it's like a one-third two-third type thing
[55:59.800 --> 56:01.720]  no I think you're right four months yeah you're right
[56:01.720 --> 56:05.560]  and I I can't help but think that to me they if they're going to do something like
[56:05.560 --> 56:09.560]  that it's backwards because it's it I'm I I'm the
[56:09.560 --> 56:12.280]  minimal to the argument that it when it's 8.45
[56:12.280 --> 56:15.560]  and PM 8.45 and you're trying to put your kid to bed
[56:15.560 --> 56:20.120]  that and it's enough daylight where you could be outside playing ball
[56:20.120 --> 56:24.040]  it's a tough sell right like because now you feel like you're almost lying to
[56:24.040 --> 56:27.720]  your kid you're you know how can you say it's bedtime
[56:27.720 --> 56:30.920]  you know that does it does seem dishonest right
[56:30.920 --> 56:34.040]  it's like you're saying it's bedtime and
[56:34.040 --> 56:38.600]  your kid hopefully hopefully your kid has a window in their bedroom
[56:38.600 --> 56:42.200]  and they can look and see that it's daylight it's you know I understand that's
[56:42.200 --> 56:43.960]  a hard sell but those are the months where I
[56:43.960 --> 56:48.360]  I wouldn't be opposed to to rejiggering it like in the
[56:48.360 --> 56:51.800]  around June you know circle four months around June where it's
[56:51.800 --> 56:56.520]  longest and take an hour of daylight there my problem is I just get
[56:56.520 --> 56:59.400]  so I don't want to throw the word depressed
[56:59.400 --> 57:02.200]  around because I don't I don't have like a clinical
[57:02.200 --> 57:04.760]  depression but I think it's a little a little blue
[57:04.760 --> 57:08.040]  I get I would call it like a melancholy like like
[57:08.040 --> 57:12.840]  like this need right now this like today I feel a little melancholy just
[57:12.840 --> 57:16.520]  because it's right now it's it's a rainy day here in Philadelphia it's probably
[57:16.520 --> 57:22.680]  why my cable went out it you know Comcast doesn't really hold up too much
[57:22.680 --> 57:27.960]  in the wet weather that's a that's a lot to ask of hardware
[57:27.960 --> 57:30.680]  John well you know that's true though you remember because
[57:30.680 --> 57:34.200]  back when I did the show with Dan it really was the case this was before the
[57:34.200 --> 57:37.160]  guy pulled out that rusty why thing you know why
[57:37.160 --> 57:41.240]  splitter no it's true we're on rainy days when when Dan and I would record the show
[57:41.240 --> 57:45.160]  years ago he would always he could tell because it was like
[57:45.160 --> 57:48.680]  my it was like all broken up like the Skype audio was all busted up on a
[57:48.680 --> 57:51.640]  rain it was very consistent that if it was rainy my
[57:51.640 --> 57:55.320]  my connection could not handle Skype that seems crazy
[57:55.320 --> 58:00.120]  uh that's fixed I think but it's but anyway it's a rainy day here though it's
[58:00.120 --> 58:02.520]  like my wife gets home from work and it's dark
[58:02.520 --> 58:05.960]  and that's that's you know it's no fun for me it's certainly no fun for her
[58:05.960 --> 58:09.080]  but for people who have like an actual job you're coming home and it's in
[58:09.080 --> 58:13.320]  after the time goes back right come on it's dark and it's totally depressing
[58:13.320 --> 58:17.080]  yeah I used when I used to when I used to work many many years ago
[58:17.080 --> 58:20.920]  at the the Philadelphia Inquirer it was a type of plays type of gig where
[58:20.920 --> 58:25.720]  it was you know you'd show up at nine and you'd left at five everybody left at five
[58:25.720 --> 58:29.080]  you know like four fifty five everybody's putting coats on it was just that type
[58:29.080 --> 58:33.240]  of office there was nothing in the department I worked in it was nothing
[58:33.240 --> 58:37.000]  you know no reason to stay uh and I remember leaving the one time it was like I
[58:37.000 --> 58:39.720]  must have been like the first weekday I guess the Monday after we just had the
[58:39.720 --> 58:45.000]  clocks back and it was pitch black it's just dark as night and as you leave
[58:45.000 --> 58:50.440]  work at five it just was very depressing I think
[58:50.440 --> 58:53.720]  well let me let me this is what I tell me I am let me ask you this
[58:53.720 --> 58:58.120]  why don't they just change I hear here's the thing it would seem really weird
[58:58.120 --> 59:02.680]  if they just change time and we said from now on like daylight savings time
[59:02.680 --> 59:06.280]  is what we're gonna have all the time but it sounds like that's kind of what
[59:06.280 --> 59:08.680]  you're advocating for it's like why not just change time
[59:08.680 --> 59:12.440]  so that we just we just toss in an hour here we change this stuff around and
[59:12.440 --> 59:15.240]  now we uh we have light at night that that's kind of really what you're saying
[59:15.240 --> 59:17.880]  right that is what I'm saying that makes it seem
[59:17.880 --> 59:20.760]  doubly crazy that we change it during the year
[59:20.760 --> 59:24.200]  that it's it's that going back and forth so I would be nice if there was I mean I
[59:24.200 --> 59:27.240]  know I can't do a lot with the rotation of the plan and the angles and stuff
[59:27.240 --> 59:30.440]  but still you know I mean that that's the part that's weird is the is the
[59:30.440 --> 59:34.120]  changing part I think I think you could make a case and I'm not a
[59:34.120 --> 59:37.080]  scientist John I think you could make a case for saying we just need to
[59:37.080 --> 59:40.280]  permanently do this this needs to be just time now
[59:40.280 --> 59:44.280]  I had it and it's just it's such a kick in the
[59:44.280 --> 59:48.040]  teeth I feel that when you've set it back in the fall
[59:48.040 --> 59:52.200]  that you know like because you know the days were getting shorter
[59:52.200 --> 59:55.720]  as October went on anyway you know you could kind of see you know
[59:55.720 --> 59:59.400]  you can see like hey man I remember when it was so light out yeah I really
[59:59.400 --> 1:00:02.360]  I really noticed it this year it seemed like it happened fast
[1:00:02.360 --> 1:00:06.200]  it's I don't know it did seem like that to me too but it's uh
[1:00:06.200 --> 1:00:09.400]  I don't know when I was a kid it seemed like I was ignorant and stuff like
[1:00:09.400 --> 1:00:13.400]  that I didn't even know what time it was most of the time I guess but
[1:00:13.400 --> 1:00:18.280]  uh as an adult now though and I feel like that sudden extra hour
[1:00:18.280 --> 1:00:22.760]  jump of darkness at what should be a reasonable time of day not like what
[1:00:22.760 --> 1:00:25.720]  most people would still call the afternoon not the evening
[1:00:25.720 --> 1:00:32.040]  it's just it's it I don't know I'd almost rather even I
[1:00:32.040 --> 1:00:34.840]  I would advocate switching to the daylight savings time year
[1:00:34.840 --> 1:00:38.280]  round I would just say let's just call that it's set the clocks on that
[1:00:38.280 --> 1:00:39.960]  I can't believe I've never heard of that before because that
[1:00:39.960 --> 1:00:42.600]  because that seems like the kind of uh
[1:00:42.600 --> 1:00:45.400]  wackdoodle campaign that I would have heard about by now and it kind of makes
[1:00:45.400 --> 1:00:48.360]  sense let's just get one guys here here here here's your slogan
[1:00:48.360 --> 1:00:52.840]  just pick one that's the slogan it doesn't seem though it seems like a hard
[1:00:52.840 --> 1:00:57.320]  hard thing for them to ever get off the ground so what's the what's the downside
[1:00:57.320 --> 1:00:59.720]  of permanent daylight savings time because I have to tell you
[1:00:59.720 --> 1:01:02.680]  just in fairness I could get behind your wackdoodle scheme as long as it's
[1:01:02.680 --> 1:01:06.760]  consistent the hard part the hard part is like I say like in the summer
[1:01:06.760 --> 1:01:10.120]  time I mean we just need an idea and I understand the light changes like I
[1:01:10.120 --> 1:01:13.800]  say angles rotation but like there just has to be some idea that if I
[1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:16.680]  I don't sound like I'm trying to do some kind of social engineering
[1:01:16.680 --> 1:01:19.960]  trick on my kid to get it a bit 2 p.m. or something like that
[1:01:19.960 --> 1:01:24.360]  you just need to pick one the downside whenever I get on my hobby horse
[1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:27.640]  about this I always hear I hear from the morning it's the morning people
[1:01:27.640 --> 1:01:30.440]  is that you know all of a sudden now the morning people have it's
[1:01:30.440 --> 1:01:34.520]  you know it's pitch black and you know they always try it out it's always
[1:01:34.520 --> 1:01:37.320]  and everybody always trots out the children but then you know kids are
[1:01:37.320 --> 1:01:40.680]  waiting for the school bus and it's pitch black at you know 715 in the
[1:01:40.680 --> 1:01:45.640]  morning or whatever and that's not good I don't know and to me and it's
[1:01:45.640 --> 1:01:49.080]  like I had somebody's I think there's like a farming angle on it but to me it's
[1:01:49.080 --> 1:01:52.120]  like well the farmer should just get up when the sun rises don't you know
[1:01:52.120 --> 1:01:55.320]  don't worry about what time it is I don't understand what the why where the
[1:01:55.320 --> 1:01:59.640]  farmer farmer's so time constraint do they need to get to AA like why why
[1:01:59.640 --> 1:02:03.400]  does it matter what time the sun is up is the grain store closing like
[1:02:03.400 --> 1:02:07.480]  well I don't understand exactly how that you know I'm saying it only makes sense
[1:02:07.480 --> 1:02:10.280]  if there's other stuff the farmer is have to do as well as we're going to
[1:02:10.280 --> 1:02:13.720]  feel otherwise the clock clocks don't mean fuck all you just go work in your
[1:02:13.720 --> 1:02:17.480]  goddamn field where you need to it isn't like you look you look you pull out
[1:02:17.480 --> 1:02:21.960]  your pocket watch and go oh dearie me it's four I better start wrapping up
[1:02:21.960 --> 1:02:26.440]  now get back to work farm farm yeah I don't I don't know what to deal with
[1:02:26.440 --> 1:02:30.920]  that I did you know you know and and just right here in in my own household
[1:02:30.920 --> 1:02:34.920]  you know as I endlessly bitched about the daylight savings time
[1:02:34.920 --> 1:02:39.000]  roll out last week uh Amy even said well you don't take the kid to school
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:42.280]  every day it's pitch black it was pitch black last week it's nicer now that we
[1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:45.960]  you know look it actually looks like morning when I'm taking them to school
[1:02:45.960 --> 1:02:49.560]  so I appreciate that I don't know maybe the answer is is that sometime around
[1:02:49.560 --> 1:02:53.480]  November like through from November through like new years
[1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:58.440]  we should all just stay in bed mm well I think that the depressing
[1:02:58.440 --> 1:03:01.800]  lack of sunlight really supports that I think if we all just agreed to just
[1:03:01.800 --> 1:03:05.960]  be a little bit more low-key you know low-key our way into Christmas
[1:03:05.960 --> 1:03:09.880]  yeah well is is there also an angle of energy
[1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:14.120]  saving isn't that another angle of it oh definitely I think that's I
[1:03:14.120 --> 1:03:17.480]  think that was the explanation behind the why we kept it
[1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:22.280]  and well and why we've expanded it like why we've added made more and more
[1:03:22.280 --> 1:03:27.960]  of the of the calendar year daylight savings
[1:03:27.960 --> 1:03:32.520]  is that it it I don't know I'm not quite sure what the argument is though
[1:03:32.520 --> 1:03:37.320]  I have to be honest with you John I'm still deeply confused just about time
[1:03:37.320 --> 1:03:41.160]  zones alone I was talking to my curly the other day and I was asking
[1:03:41.160 --> 1:03:43.560]  them whether they get Christmas in a different season then we do
[1:03:43.560 --> 1:03:47.960]  honestly don't understand anything about how any of this works
[1:03:47.960 --> 1:03:51.000]  and I still have to basically mentally draw a picture
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:54.200]  to understand which time change causes what difference
[1:03:54.200 --> 1:03:56.840]  and that my brain is just not wired to totally understand this
[1:03:56.840 --> 1:03:59.480]  I'm bluffing my way through this a little bit but I honestly
[1:03:59.480 --> 1:04:03.240]  find everything involving time completely bizarre
[1:04:03.240 --> 1:04:06.440]  do you know what the uh China does right
[1:04:06.440 --> 1:04:10.280]  hmm what did you did you know that China does not have they don't believe in
[1:04:10.280 --> 1:04:13.320]  time zones hmm so China is a land mass
[1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:17.960]  well it's a land mass roughly comparable to the United States
[1:04:17.960 --> 1:04:21.240]  you know it's about you know it's the same sort of shape too it's
[1:04:21.240 --> 1:04:24.760]  you know wider than it is tall and it's about the same width like if they went
[1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:28.760]  with time zones they would span four time zones like the
[1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:32.200]  continental United States does but they don't do it they just have
[1:04:32.200 --> 1:04:36.280]  the clocks are set to Chinese time and that's it and so if you're
[1:04:36.280 --> 1:04:39.400]  on the well regardless of like how far north you are because I mean that
[1:04:39.400 --> 1:04:42.920]  we're no west it would be no east and west no but I mean also you know as you go
[1:04:42.920 --> 1:04:46.680]  higher up like in Washington like their days are really short
[1:04:46.680 --> 1:04:49.880]  you know I mean as you go further oh right right the days shorter
[1:04:49.880 --> 1:04:53.320]  yeah yeah like people in Florida get a little bit more
[1:04:53.320 --> 1:04:56.920]  a little bit more completely perplexing it if somebody told me that this is one of
[1:04:56.920 --> 1:05:00.600]  those Capricorn one situations and the whole time thing was a bluff
[1:05:00.600 --> 1:05:04.200]  I would have no trouble believing it I find it all completely perplexing
[1:05:04.200 --> 1:05:06.920]  no but it's it's like totally serious we're like they're
[1:05:06.920 --> 1:05:09.560]  they have one time in China it's just Chinese time
[1:05:09.560 --> 1:05:13.400]  I think it's I think it's optimized for their east coast because that's
[1:05:13.400 --> 1:05:18.040]  you know that's where all the big cities are and but if you live in the
[1:05:18.040 --> 1:05:23.640]  western side of China the sun doesn't even come up until like 11 am
[1:05:23.640 --> 1:05:26.840]  and you just they just set their live their lives accordingly
[1:05:26.840 --> 1:05:29.880]  like maybe I don't know maybe school doesn't start till 11 over there I feel
[1:05:29.880 --> 1:05:32.680]  like I've seen like three different documentaries in the last year that
[1:05:32.680 --> 1:05:35.720]  lead me to believe that the whole modern concept of time
[1:05:35.720 --> 1:05:40.040]  and being on a certain time comes out of the railroad schedules is that right
[1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:43.720]  is that what I believe yeah could be yeah because I guess there was a time
[1:05:43.720 --> 1:05:46.200]  when like each train company had their own time that they kept and it became
[1:05:46.200 --> 1:05:48.360]  very important obviously if you're you know changing trains that all
[1:05:48.360 --> 1:05:52.600]  got to work together I don't know yeah but it's nice though see it
[1:05:52.600 --> 1:05:56.120]  there is a certain appeal to that so it's like in China it depends where you
[1:05:56.120 --> 1:06:01.240]  live if you think of what you know like what what is a good bedtime
[1:06:01.240 --> 1:06:04.920]  for a child you know it might be off by three hours depending on if you're in
[1:06:04.920 --> 1:06:09.160]  the east or the west but if you tell somebody I will we will we will have this
[1:06:09.160 --> 1:06:11.720]  conference call at two o'clock in the afternoon
[1:06:11.720 --> 1:06:15.560]  everybody everybody knows it's at the right time
[1:06:15.560 --> 1:06:18.040]  I think that's very appealing that's why I mean like if I could ever get my
[1:06:18.040 --> 1:06:21.480]  brain around I go into pure GMT I find something very appealing about that
[1:06:21.480 --> 1:06:24.120]  like that it's always this certain time like that's that's that's the one we
[1:06:24.120 --> 1:06:27.480]  all refer to I mean even just you know trying to schedule stuff with people in
[1:06:27.480 --> 1:06:29.720]  this you know increasingly it's the central times on it really
[1:06:29.720 --> 1:06:33.240]  screws me up because it's just enough off from the two yeah
[1:06:33.240 --> 1:06:37.480]  main areas that it really screws with my head yeah I'm not good with that
[1:06:37.480 --> 1:06:40.200]  either and and you know what you're right the central time is worse because
[1:06:40.200 --> 1:06:43.560]  so I did the layer tennis commentary um
[1:06:43.560 --> 1:06:47.560]  oh yeah two two weeks ago must have been two weeks ago wasn't last week
[1:06:47.560 --> 1:06:50.360]  and that all runs on Chicago yeah
[1:06:50.360 --> 1:06:55.960]  and I it's good for me I was ready an hour early
[1:06:55.960 --> 1:06:58.200]  let's the funny part is you know I'm on the west because you're on the east
[1:06:58.200 --> 1:07:01.800]  coast and you know the east coast winds always you know eastern time is the
[1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:05.160]  winter it's the canonical time in America everybody else just has to
[1:07:05.160 --> 1:07:09.000]  like do the math central is the only time zone where I periodically go the
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:12.760]  wrong way like a few guys or three hours later than us but for some time
[1:07:12.760 --> 1:07:15.400]  for some reason sometimes when I'm doing the mental
[1:07:15.400 --> 1:07:18.360]  math I get the central time zone wrong so I'm
[1:07:18.360 --> 1:07:22.040]  basically putting them in the Pacific Ocean sometimes
[1:07:22.040 --> 1:07:26.040]  yeah and it I don't know it just doesn't seem remember the timeline do you
[1:07:26.040 --> 1:07:29.480]  understand the international uh what's it called the international
[1:07:29.480 --> 1:07:35.080]  date line yeah do you understand that no I if I make diagrams I'm in draw I
[1:07:35.080 --> 1:07:39.400]  can I can somehow guess we want to we want to New Zealand it still makes no
[1:07:39.400 --> 1:07:42.520]  sense to me that well you guys had a crazy flight because you had to get all
[1:07:42.520 --> 1:07:45.960]  the way over to here before you could even have the terrible flight we had
[1:07:45.960 --> 1:07:49.800]  but it was like a 15 hour flight but I remember arriving in New Zealand
[1:07:49.800 --> 1:07:53.400]  and we felt pretty good my wife had some nausea from you know traveling
[1:07:53.400 --> 1:07:56.760]  but I was cock of the walk I felt fun coming back from New Zealand I was out
[1:07:56.760 --> 1:08:00.760]  for three weeks it was if I found that possible
[1:08:00.760 --> 1:08:03.240]  I don't know I found that to be worse too
[1:08:03.240 --> 1:08:07.640]  yeah that getting back from New Zealand was it just felt like I felt like I
[1:08:07.640 --> 1:08:10.280]  had mono I mean I was I felt like I was
[1:08:10.280 --> 1:08:14.920]  drugged you know mike a lot mike a lot lost a birthday
[1:08:14.920 --> 1:08:18.680]  oh no oh maybe this was not the year it was the
[1:08:18.680 --> 1:08:22.680]  seven later yeah you didn't go yeah it was it was the second time I spoke at
[1:08:22.680 --> 1:08:28.760]  webstock and Michael Lop got on an airplane in SFO the day before his
[1:08:28.760 --> 1:08:33.800]  birthday and when he stepped off the plane in Auckland
[1:08:33.800 --> 1:08:37.240]  it was the day after his birthday that makes no sense that's
[1:08:37.240 --> 1:08:41.240]  that's where it got it's like weird you know you know you know it's feel like to be
[1:08:41.240 --> 1:08:47.480]  like a leap year baby yeah and I you know yeah he's a big boy you know it
[1:08:47.480 --> 1:08:52.040]  wasn't it wasn't sad about it but like I told Jonas and Jonas was just
[1:08:52.040 --> 1:08:55.400]  blown away I mean if I got nine-year-old kid like the thing that you
[1:08:55.400 --> 1:08:58.440]  lost your birthday because that's really unjust
[1:08:58.440 --> 1:09:01.800]  yeah and he like that was like the thing like when he went back to school
[1:09:01.800 --> 1:09:04.280]  because Jonas came with us again and then was like well you know what'd you
[1:09:04.280 --> 1:09:06.680]  what'd you do is like you went to New Zealand it's like wow that's also
[1:09:06.680 --> 1:09:10.600]  what happened and then his story was my dad's friend lost a birthday and
[1:09:10.600 --> 1:09:14.840]  he'd like explained and all of his friends were like that's outrageous it's
[1:09:14.840 --> 1:09:20.200]  the saddest story ever if there's anything it can make kids unionize
[1:09:20.200 --> 1:09:24.280]  because that does like missing out missing out a gift giving holiday
[1:09:24.280 --> 1:09:27.640]  right it just it does it confuses me how that could happen
[1:09:27.640 --> 1:09:30.920]  it just seems like it should be a different time
[1:09:30.920 --> 1:09:35.080]  what was he for what was he for Halloween this year
[1:09:35.080 --> 1:09:41.160]  um oh Charlotte Holmes oh wow me was with that with the hat and everything
[1:09:41.160 --> 1:09:44.520]  yeah well there's only really one way to do it you kind of have to go
[1:09:44.520 --> 1:09:48.680]  she's gonna go Cumberbatch yeah but I don't know that that's a
[1:09:48.680 --> 1:09:52.040]  that's not canonical yeah it's like it's not recognizable
[1:09:52.040 --> 1:09:55.560]  you you're not gonna you kind of got to go
[1:09:55.560 --> 1:09:59.000]  I don't know what that hat's called but yeah the Sherlock Holmes hat
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:02.840]  right that's cool what what what what so is does he read it or like movies like
[1:10:02.840 --> 1:10:04.600]  how did he get into Sherlock Holmes
[1:10:04.600 --> 1:10:08.920]  um he's into the he's into the the new movies
[1:10:08.920 --> 1:10:12.840]  the Robert Downey Jr ones enjoyed those very much
[1:10:12.840 --> 1:10:19.160]  um others are this kind of swashbuckling yeah there's
[1:10:19.160 --> 1:10:22.680]  yeah especially the second one the second one's a little it's it's it's you
[1:10:22.680 --> 1:10:25.800]  know a little Indiana Jonesy it's not it's not a very
[1:10:25.800 --> 1:10:29.720]  intellect you know there's some of that but it's it's a more action-oriented
[1:10:29.720 --> 1:10:34.680]  Sherlock Holmes nice that's a good one
[1:10:34.680 --> 1:10:38.200]  my kid was her many Granger from Harry Potter
[1:10:38.200 --> 1:10:43.560]  I saw the picture she was a dead ringer she she kind of nailed it I think
[1:10:43.560 --> 1:10:47.800]  yeah yeah that's good it's it's it's you know but this is uh it was nice because
[1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:50.760]  the last couple years before that we've done a marvel
[1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:55.880]  related you know costume superheroes so I thought this was a nice change
[1:10:55.880 --> 1:10:59.320]  yeah Jonas aiming to Amy knocks it out with the the
[1:10:59.320 --> 1:11:02.360]  the costume look at that photo look at that guy
[1:11:02.360 --> 1:11:05.560]  yeah it's got a little pipe in his hand it's got the magnifying glass
[1:11:05.560 --> 1:11:10.120]  oh my god that's so great I love his cloak yeah yeah good stuff
[1:11:10.120 --> 1:11:13.080]  yeah so Amy sources all that stuff on the internet
[1:11:13.080 --> 1:11:17.080]  why she kind of runs that joint doesn't she yeah yeah I mean I mean same here
[1:11:17.080 --> 1:11:20.440]  same here he's getting old I mean he's 10 so he's I think he's running out
[1:11:20.440 --> 1:11:23.560]  but he's done he's done just about all the big ones she's done
[1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:27.480]  trying to think he's done Buzz Lightyear that was really young Buzz Lightyear
[1:11:27.480 --> 1:11:32.840]  uh Han Solo Indiana Jones the uh my my favorite was the
[1:11:32.840 --> 1:11:36.280]  Clint Eastwood man with no name oh that was great I remember that that his
[1:11:36.280 --> 1:11:39.240]  Indiana Jones was really good too I remember that one
[1:11:39.240 --> 1:11:43.320]  uh trying to remember what else is in there
[1:11:43.320 --> 1:11:45.800]  oh doctor who he did doctor who last year
[1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:49.640]  oh he's like uh Metsmith yeah oh that's awesome
[1:11:49.640 --> 1:11:53.960]  yeah that was a good one yeah he's kind of my canary and a coal mine for what's
[1:11:53.960 --> 1:11:56.760]  happening in the world when I hear you talking about like minecraft and
[1:11:56.760 --> 1:12:00.360]  youtube and stuff like that I feel like I'm learning a lot about what's
[1:12:00.360 --> 1:12:04.600]  coming up through you and him yeah I'm looking you know Moltz wrote a
[1:12:04.600 --> 1:12:07.960]  youtube book and not a youtube book I'm a minecraft book
[1:12:07.960 --> 1:12:11.720]  really yeah wow that's coming out it's coming out
[1:12:11.720 --> 1:12:15.800]  uh might be coming out tomorrow oh that's awesome
[1:12:15.800 --> 1:12:19.000]  I can't wait to read it because I gotta tell you I this minecraft thing
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:23.160]  I still don't get it terrified by it I'm utterly terrified we went to
[1:12:23.160 --> 1:12:26.200]  Scott Simpson's birthday party over the summer
[1:12:26.200 --> 1:12:29.640]  and it was her first exposure to minecraft on a screen because I've
[1:12:29.640 --> 1:12:32.440]  yeah let's be honest I've kept her away from it because
[1:12:32.440 --> 1:12:36.600]  everything I've heard from everybody you know me right like I'm
[1:12:36.600 --> 1:12:39.240]  I'm not that guy like she can play what she can do stuff on the iPad I'm not
[1:12:39.240 --> 1:12:41.640]  like we're not crazy about that kind of stuff
[1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:45.400]  but every two a person every mom and dad's is the same thing which is there's
[1:12:45.400 --> 1:12:49.320]  the life that I had with my kid before minecraft and then life after
[1:12:49.320 --> 1:12:54.680]  it'll probably be fine but I she's seven I'm enjoying these days and I
[1:12:54.680 --> 1:12:59.960]  I'm so I'm circumspect it's pretty immersive though it can be it's
[1:12:59.960 --> 1:13:04.680]  certainly you know it the best I can get it I've
[1:13:04.680 --> 1:13:09.080]  I really can't wait to read multiple because I really I
[1:13:09.080 --> 1:13:12.520]  it's like nothing else that I've ever seen before there is a way that you can
[1:13:12.520 --> 1:13:15.400]  play it like a video game where you're running around and there's these
[1:13:15.400 --> 1:13:18.440]  creepers that are like zombies that you have to avoid
[1:13:18.440 --> 1:13:21.720]  need to build shelter it you know for the nighttime
[1:13:21.720 --> 1:13:25.880]  but that's not really that's not what kids are doing it it really is though right
[1:13:25.880 --> 1:13:30.040]  yeah it's more like virtual leg like like the lego company sort of should have
[1:13:30.040 --> 1:13:33.960]  bought minecraft like it's crazy that Microsoft either them or Disney
[1:13:33.960 --> 1:13:37.480]  Disney Disney didn't buy them because I think I really think it's got staying
[1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:42.840]  power there were so many kids in homemade minecraft costumes
[1:13:42.840 --> 1:13:46.360]  for how oh yeah but it was a very inefficient it was mostly you'd see a kid
[1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:49.720]  with a blocky kind of tunic and then holding up the box that should have been
[1:13:49.720 --> 1:13:52.840]  on their head because they can't see a damn thing but they were they were
[1:13:52.840 --> 1:13:55.800]  blocking make minecraft or whatever his name is
[1:13:55.800 --> 1:14:02.040]  uh I'm trying to it's mostly about the building the collaboration
[1:14:02.040 --> 1:14:05.800]  you yeah the game itself and forgive me because I I've never played it but
[1:14:05.800 --> 1:14:09.160]  so basically you start out in this world and you got to stay alive you got to
[1:14:09.160 --> 1:14:12.520]  build stuff you have to mine and then that enables you to get things and then
[1:14:12.520 --> 1:14:16.760]  you make comp combinations of different things make other things
[1:14:16.760 --> 1:14:21.720]  that's kind of the idea yeah and it's like you you dig to get raw materials
[1:14:21.720 --> 1:14:27.480]  and then you can turn raw materials into things and the whole game is
[1:14:27.480 --> 1:14:32.760]  super hackable like you just unzip a jar file and there's all you know
[1:14:32.760 --> 1:14:36.120]  it's like going into it like in mac terms like opening up the application
[1:14:36.120 --> 1:14:39.160]  package and you can go in there and change all the stuff out
[1:14:39.160 --> 1:14:43.800]  it's like reset it for pixel yeah it's very much so it's
[1:14:43.800 --> 1:14:47.720]  exactly like the way we hacked our stuff with res edit
[1:14:47.720 --> 1:14:51.240]  20 years ago that's what the kids are doing with the minecraft
[1:14:51.240 --> 1:14:57.640]  extensions and mod packs but yeah and it's like and they play you know
[1:14:57.640 --> 1:15:00.360]  this is the part where it starts to get like hey what the hell's
[1:15:00.360 --> 1:15:03.160]  I gotta I kind of have to step in here as a parent like make sure this is
[1:15:03.160 --> 1:15:06.200]  all right is when they collaborate on a server
[1:15:06.200 --> 1:15:10.600]  and and it's all open this is the thing as you can get can't you get like your own
[1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:12.920]  I was seeing the penny arcade guys were talking about this like you can get like a
[1:15:12.920 --> 1:15:16.920]  private server right if you absolutely no and it's really like as a
[1:15:16.920 --> 1:15:20.360]  responsible parent it's like you kind of you know you kind of have to limit it
[1:15:20.360 --> 1:15:23.720]  to private servers you know it's like you can't just go and play on the
[1:15:23.720 --> 1:15:29.240]  servers for people or you know could be anybody it's like you know so he's got
[1:15:29.240 --> 1:15:33.560]  one you know it's cheap I don't know it's like three dollars a month
[1:15:33.560 --> 1:15:36.760]  or something like that but Jonas has his own server
[1:15:36.760 --> 1:15:39.240]  it's like you know they're getting a web hosting account
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:43.320]  cost like three three bucks a month and but then him and his friend he just gives
[1:15:43.320 --> 1:15:46.680]  the address to his friends and him and his friends from school can play
[1:15:46.680 --> 1:15:51.240]  together and it's just like the six of them anything it's like a private room
[1:15:51.240 --> 1:15:55.160]  yeah and you know and they built stuff together it's crazy like he showed me
[1:15:55.160 --> 1:15:59.240]  like him and one of his pals from school built like a place for their
[1:15:59.240 --> 1:16:02.840]  characters to live like a skyscraper you know with like a you know
[1:16:02.840 --> 1:16:07.240]  pretty cool it was pretty cool pad really uh like way up high though
[1:16:07.240 --> 1:16:12.680]  like massive massive building really pretty cool that sounds like a lot of fun
[1:16:12.680 --> 1:16:17.000]  I don't know I am it's very freeform that's the thing
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:21.480]  it sounds very creative and collaborative yeah and the thing is is the
[1:16:21.480 --> 1:16:26.040]  company behind it it's it's really genius and it is sort of a triumph
[1:16:26.040 --> 1:16:31.240]  of openness where you know like I said the game is hackable
[1:16:31.240 --> 1:16:35.800]  but if you want to play online it's not like you have to play with
[1:16:35.800 --> 1:16:41.400]  the official minecraft online server and you have to pay for it or whatever
[1:16:41.400 --> 1:16:45.560]  anybody like can run their own minecraft server it's all just you know
[1:16:45.560 --> 1:16:48.600]  you know like the game is is commercially you have to pay for the game
[1:16:48.600 --> 1:16:53.240]  you know I'm sure you do you license a copy like a seat
[1:16:53.240 --> 1:16:57.320]  I don't know what we pass that's gotta be so boring for people
[1:16:57.320 --> 1:17:00.680]  it's like I don't know let me understand his television has channels
[1:17:00.680 --> 1:17:04.040]  how does that work you have to get paid a ha ha how do you change them
[1:17:04.040 --> 1:17:07.240]  but like that the iPad app is like 699 and that
[1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:11.240]  oh you played on a iPad wow okay yeah but it's weird though the iPad
[1:17:11.240 --> 1:17:15.480]  one is weird like it's really it's like solo like you can't can you can't play
[1:17:15.480 --> 1:17:16.840]  the iPad one on the
[1:17:16.840 --> 1:17:20.920]  say if it's Java yeah yeah I don't even know how they made the iPad one
[1:17:20.920 --> 1:17:23.720]  since the whole thing's written in Java but anyway you play on a computer
[1:17:23.720 --> 1:17:26.680]  and you can connect to any server and anybody can run a server
[1:17:26.680 --> 1:17:30.840]  and so there's public servers where there are thousands of people running around
[1:17:30.840 --> 1:17:33.880]  and you can just set up your own server anywhere you want
[1:17:33.880 --> 1:17:37.240]  and have just you and you know your two pals
[1:17:37.240 --> 1:17:39.480]  and you know it's a nice and peaceful and quiet
[1:17:39.480 --> 1:17:44.360]  but you can chat you know while you're on the server and that's where you know
[1:17:44.360 --> 1:17:46.680]  there's some parenting that needs to come in
[1:17:46.680 --> 1:17:49.480]  like you know needs it you know can't just be
[1:17:49.480 --> 1:17:53.080]  how do you how do you how do you how do you limit access to that you got hours for
[1:17:53.080 --> 1:17:56.680]  that or yeah they got it's got to be like you know certain time you got to
[1:17:56.680 --> 1:17:59.240]  you know make sure your homework's done first and
[1:17:59.240 --> 1:18:02.600]  my kids in frickin first grade and by the time we pick her up from after
[1:18:02.600 --> 1:18:05.000]  school and she does her homework like we've got I feel like we've got like an
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:09.080]  hour before bedtime so maybe maybe the thing here is to just is to turbo
[1:18:09.080 --> 1:18:12.840]  like you guys do and just push push bed down to like 11.30
[1:18:12.840 --> 1:18:17.320]  wait can't do that on a school night Jesus well you know she'll figure it out
[1:18:17.320 --> 1:18:20.200]  she could nap she could nap during recess or something I guess
[1:18:20.200 --> 1:18:24.120]  I have to admit as a parent I do feel like
[1:18:24.120 --> 1:18:28.040]  Jonas's school seems pretty good on homework they don't he seems to get a lot
[1:18:28.040 --> 1:18:32.360]  less than a lot of kids seem to now nationally are you guys are coming
[1:18:32.360 --> 1:18:37.400]  core state no okay I don't even I know I don't think we are
[1:18:37.400 --> 1:18:42.440]  um it just seems to me I as a parent I have the exact same
[1:18:42.440 --> 1:18:46.200]  perspective on it that I had when I was actually in school which is this is
[1:18:46.200 --> 1:18:49.720]  bullshit I've been I you had me all day right
[1:18:49.720 --> 1:18:54.040]  right like it's a long day like 8 a.m. till 3 in the afternoon is
[1:18:54.040 --> 1:19:00.200]  awful a lot of chunk of your time uh why is there more work to be done
[1:19:00.200 --> 1:19:03.960]  I don't I've never it feels like it feels like a hack it feels like a behavioral
[1:19:03.960 --> 1:19:07.880]  hack cuz like with my kid she brings home like worksheets like right now
[1:19:07.880 --> 1:19:11.720]  she's doing fractions and so it's a lot of like show you know two
[1:19:11.720 --> 1:19:15.560]  fourths show three eighths you know by filling in these pie pieces
[1:19:15.560 --> 1:19:20.120]  and it really seems like and this is not bad but it is what she did at school
[1:19:20.120 --> 1:19:22.200]  it's just they want her to do more of it at home
[1:19:22.200 --> 1:19:25.560]  which to my mind like I get the idea of the repetition and practice
[1:19:25.560 --> 1:19:29.000]  even the kind of you know primacy and recency thing of trying it in different
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:32.760]  places like I can get all of that but this is one of those few legacy
[1:19:32.760 --> 1:19:35.000]  things that feels like something from our childhood
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:37.640]  where it really legitimately school was about teaching in a follow rules
[1:19:37.640 --> 1:19:40.600]  and I was about teaching you to like habituate yourself to certain kind
[1:19:40.600 --> 1:19:44.600]  you know what I mean like yeah that has changed so much
[1:19:44.600 --> 1:19:47.640]  from when we were kids I mean I don't know if you ever have gone through
[1:19:47.640 --> 1:19:49.720]  stuff with your kid with like creative spelling
[1:19:49.720 --> 1:19:53.080]  we're like kids are encouraged to just try to spell stuff however
[1:19:53.080 --> 1:19:58.200]  you know I'm driving that absolutely it did me at first we had a conference
[1:19:58.200 --> 1:20:02.200]  with the teacher about it but you know I was a kid there's no way you would see
[1:20:02.200 --> 1:20:05.400]  something on the wall outside your classroom with a typo on it
[1:20:05.400 --> 1:20:07.240]  it would be now a red pen
[1:20:07.240 --> 1:20:12.360]  I'd Jonas at school I don't know when I don't think they started
[1:20:12.360 --> 1:20:15.960]  trying to enforce correct spelling until fourth grade like
[1:20:15.960 --> 1:20:20.200]  like first second third grade it's to spell everything now everyone
[1:20:20.200 --> 1:20:23.720]  and somehow the teachers are adept at reading it but I was like I
[1:20:23.720 --> 1:20:26.680]  can't even you gotta unhook your mind and just in my case you got to read it
[1:20:26.680 --> 1:20:30.520]  phonetically I mean it depends on which teeth my daughter is missing
[1:20:30.520 --> 1:20:34.040]  because she'll pronounce things with a lisp like when she writes it
[1:20:34.040 --> 1:20:37.880]  but but I was I was a little concerned in a way that I'm usually not
[1:20:37.880 --> 1:20:40.360]  wrongs like is this okay is she wired right like should
[1:20:40.360 --> 1:20:44.600]  that's exactly what I must I I had the exact same
[1:20:44.600 --> 1:20:48.200]  experience and then I would would open my eyes as I went to I
[1:20:48.200 --> 1:20:51.960]  one day I went to pick up at school and outside his classroom
[1:20:51.960 --> 1:20:56.840]  was the it was some project that the whole class had done everybody's was
[1:20:56.840 --> 1:21:01.800]  up on the the tact to the the court board right runs on now on the hallway
[1:21:01.800 --> 1:21:05.160]  and I started looking at everybody else's in this class and they were all
[1:21:05.160 --> 1:21:08.440]  exactly the same like in terms of spelling it literally
[1:21:08.440 --> 1:21:12.920]  and I'm right it's embarrassing at first because you're like
[1:21:12.920 --> 1:21:15.960]  is mine the only kid who doesn't know how to spell you know
[1:21:15.960 --> 1:21:20.360]  words all right I thought oh shoo that's a big relief
[1:21:20.360 --> 1:21:23.640]  I kept thinking there's got to be we're going to get an uncomfortable
[1:21:23.640 --> 1:21:26.440]  conteacher conference where they're going to say hey he's got it
[1:21:26.440 --> 1:21:29.400]  and then no it never happened and then like all of a sudden in fourth grade though
[1:21:29.400 --> 1:21:33.480]  they started like correcting their spelling and the kids were all like what the
[1:21:33.480 --> 1:21:38.440]  fuck yeah right exactly well I you know I I get it I think I mean it's
[1:21:38.440 --> 1:21:41.720]  who knows why anything does anything John it's so it's so
[1:21:41.720 --> 1:21:44.600]  conceited for us to imagine that we can understand anything
[1:21:44.600 --> 1:21:47.480]  as lay people about how something works out or does it
[1:21:47.480 --> 1:21:50.440]  but I will say you know what when we brought this up with her teaching
[1:21:50.440 --> 1:21:52.520]  I'm sure this is super interesting to people who want to know about the
[1:21:52.520 --> 1:21:56.360]  Apple ecosystem but people but but what we went in there like hey
[1:21:56.360 --> 1:21:58.520]  is this is this a good thing she said look it's first grade
[1:21:58.520 --> 1:22:02.040]  you know she's at that time six like we I just want her to come in here and
[1:22:02.040 --> 1:22:05.640]  write as much as she can every day and I was like whoa
[1:22:05.640 --> 1:22:10.120]  but shouldn't she just be writing a lowercase letter a 40 times on a page
[1:22:10.120 --> 1:22:14.360]  like we do and the funny part is she does she loves
[1:22:14.360 --> 1:22:18.600]  she I think she has graphic failure we put on a like a we put on like a
[1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:21.480]  like a Harry Potter audiobook when she gets home from school and she sits there
[1:22:21.480 --> 1:22:24.760]  and makes art and draws and writes for like two hours
[1:22:24.760 --> 1:22:27.800]  I never would have I mean I would have scribbled a little bit and colored
[1:22:27.800 --> 1:22:31.880]  maybe at her age but now she's doing stuff she's teaching herself cursive
[1:22:31.880 --> 1:22:36.120]  by tracing I had zero just in cursive when I was six or seven years old
[1:22:36.120 --> 1:22:38.920]  no she's teaching it now to herself because it's fun
[1:22:38.920 --> 1:22:41.640]  because it's all that I guess it just all seems doable so why wouldn't I just
[1:22:41.640 --> 1:22:46.040]  teach myself cursive I guess I'm my only interest in it when I was that
[1:22:46.040 --> 1:22:48.920]  early is I want to be able to read my parents
[1:22:48.920 --> 1:22:52.840]  and stuff not like like diaries or whatever but it seemed like my parents had
[1:22:52.840 --> 1:22:55.640]  this secret language that I couldn't understand like
[1:22:55.640 --> 1:22:58.600]  my mom would write a shopping list and I couldn't read it
[1:22:58.600 --> 1:23:02.840]  right right right right well you know it's the state the obvious I think
[1:23:02.840 --> 1:23:07.240]  you know when you have stuff that you want to read when you have an incentive
[1:23:07.240 --> 1:23:10.760]  I mean the obvious example being like oh a list of ideas for presence or
[1:23:10.760 --> 1:23:14.280]  something or anything like whatever stuff on screen and in my case with my
[1:23:14.280 --> 1:23:17.880]  kid comics like she can sauce out a huge amount of the story
[1:23:17.880 --> 1:23:21.720]  from the sequential art but then she can also like put together enough of the
[1:23:21.720 --> 1:23:25.240]  words to know what it says without me reading it which I find
[1:23:25.240 --> 1:23:29.720]  fantastic you know it's it's weird though because like I'm I'm
[1:23:29.720 --> 1:23:32.600]  I have really mixed feelings about a lot of stuff with the school stuff we've
[1:23:32.600 --> 1:23:35.720]  got the common core here you know which is the
[1:23:35.720 --> 1:23:39.320]  I guess the progeny of no child left behind was lots of
[1:23:39.320 --> 1:23:42.120]  things you have to teach a certain way you got to be tested a certain way and
[1:23:42.120 --> 1:23:45.800]  some of it did you have new math when you were a kid remember new math
[1:23:45.800 --> 1:23:47.960]  and your parents were always confused they
[1:23:47.960 --> 1:23:51.640]  it's kind of a new version of new math that is completely mind-boggling
[1:23:51.640 --> 1:23:54.760]  yeah I didn't like the way they taught math and it did I
[1:23:54.760 --> 1:23:57.560]  I don't think it worked very well for Jonas I
[1:23:57.560 --> 1:24:01.480]  math is he's just not not a math person yeah and I was I
[1:24:01.480 --> 1:24:04.200]  I took the math like official water like I was always
[1:24:04.200 --> 1:24:07.320]  very very I never I don't even know how I learned everything they you could
[1:24:07.320 --> 1:24:11.400]  just show it to me as a kid yeah and I figured it out some kids just see stuff
[1:24:11.400 --> 1:24:15.160]  and it's just in and I really may because I'm a slightly visual person
[1:24:15.160 --> 1:24:18.040]  I think about like some people people with perfect pitch
[1:24:18.040 --> 1:24:20.840]  basically see notes in the way that I see colors
[1:24:20.840 --> 1:24:23.800]  people who have met see relationships that I don't see
[1:24:23.800 --> 1:24:26.440]  and I think some people are really just wired that way
[1:24:26.440 --> 1:24:30.600]  and boy god bless the man or woman who can identify that in your kid
[1:24:30.600 --> 1:24:34.040]  and and know what that's gonna mean for them both up and down as they go
[1:24:34.040 --> 1:24:36.680]  forward the thing that they didn't do
[1:24:36.680 --> 1:24:39.240]  and I don't even know what the what the teaching method is
[1:24:39.240 --> 1:24:42.680]  but they when I was in first grade we memorized everything
[1:24:42.680 --> 1:24:47.160]  we had to memorize 6 plus 7 is 13 7 plus 6 is 13 7
[1:24:47.160 --> 1:24:50.120]  memorize them all and we had speed tests
[1:24:50.120 --> 1:24:53.480]  and I that's all I remember from first grade math is
[1:24:53.480 --> 1:24:58.280]  you know we'd get like a sheet with 40 you know basic addition
[1:24:58.280 --> 1:25:02.360]  problems like that and you don't have like 90 seconds or two minutes to do it
[1:25:02.360 --> 1:25:05.080]  and if you know it was expected that some of the kids weren't even going to
[1:25:05.080 --> 1:25:08.120]  complete the whole thing because it was not just about accuracy it was about
[1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:09.880]  you know getting fast at it
[1:25:09.880 --> 1:25:10.680]  hmm
[1:25:10.680 --> 1:25:13.800]  Jonas is school never you know
[1:25:13.800 --> 1:25:16.440]  encouraged any kind of memorization of anything
[1:25:16.440 --> 1:25:20.200]  and in fact I just remember times tables like in third grade going on for ever
[1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:21.240]  and ever
[1:25:21.240 --> 1:25:24.440]  no and in fact they were allowed to um
[1:25:24.440 --> 1:25:27.960]  like with times tables you know like it just like the the matrix
[1:25:27.960 --> 1:25:31.640]  you know the sick you know the numbers across numbers down and you
[1:25:31.640 --> 1:25:35.560]  you go down and over and you can get the the product
[1:25:35.560 --> 1:25:38.680]  they were allowed to use that chart when they take tests
[1:25:38.680 --> 1:25:42.920]  wow and it to me is crazy because it's like well that's what it was when we were
[1:25:42.920 --> 1:25:43.560]  kids
[1:25:43.560 --> 1:25:47.640]  yeah it and it's you know it's like take some forever to do to to complete
[1:25:47.640 --> 1:25:49.160]  if they a math test
[1:25:49.160 --> 1:25:52.120]  that's amazing I don't know in third grade that's what we did every day
[1:25:52.120 --> 1:25:55.800]  is we practiced products and then we had the same
[1:25:55.800 --> 1:26:00.120]  you know in a different order like mixed up if we did the same 100 problems then
[1:26:00.120 --> 1:26:02.440]  and that's what we did every single day
[1:26:02.440 --> 1:26:06.920]  but uh you know my take on it as a parent is I I you know I'm certainly
[1:26:06.920 --> 1:26:09.720]  interested in this education but I'm not going to pretend like I'm an
[1:26:09.720 --> 1:26:12.840]  education expert and that the people you know who did our
[1:26:12.840 --> 1:26:16.200]  education experts that you know just because this
[1:26:16.200 --> 1:26:21.240]  confounds my common sense approach I don't want to be that guy
[1:26:21.240 --> 1:26:24.680]  you know there are so many of that guy Joe
[1:26:24.680 --> 1:26:29.000]  right my wife does a lot of stuff with PTA just really involved in the PTA
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:31.720]  and like there are so many of that guy
[1:26:31.720 --> 1:26:35.240]  or gal and it's just the person who comes in who read something in the New
[1:26:35.240 --> 1:26:36.040]  Yorker
[1:26:36.040 --> 1:26:39.240]  and like they got some ideas about how to really shake things up
[1:26:39.240 --> 1:26:41.880]  and it's not that different from your 22-year-old friend who's giving you
[1:26:41.880 --> 1:26:43.720]  advice on on child rearing
[1:26:43.720 --> 1:26:47.800]  right you know it's like I'm and let me just say in terms of disclosure
[1:26:47.800 --> 1:26:51.160]  nothing in this world is more humbling or educational for me than walking in
[1:26:51.160 --> 1:26:53.400]  like volunteering in the classroom going on a field trip
[1:26:53.400 --> 1:26:57.000]  and I realize how much I am doing horribly wrong compared these teachers and I'm
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:59.640]  the one with all the smart ideas right I want to college and stuff right
[1:26:59.640 --> 1:27:03.320]  you feel like such a dumbass so I don't go into the you know
[1:27:03.320 --> 1:27:07.160]  I'm certainly thinking I it seems to me that they could
[1:27:07.160 --> 1:27:09.880]  it would do well if they would just spend a month or two
[1:27:09.880 --> 1:27:12.840]  honing in on memorizing you know some of these
[1:27:12.840 --> 1:27:16.360]  math facts but I don't go into the teacher conference and say here's what you
[1:27:16.360 --> 1:27:17.960]  should do you know
[1:27:17.960 --> 1:27:21.640]  yeah I kind of don't I have to admit I don't understand how you would not
[1:27:21.640 --> 1:27:24.760]  do that but then I think in her homework and I'm sure you've seen numerous
[1:27:24.760 --> 1:27:28.360]  things there's probably whole tumblers devoted to the wackadoodle way
[1:27:28.360 --> 1:27:31.160]  they're supposed to do math now with these word problems and stuff like
[1:27:31.160 --> 1:27:35.320]  that fact fact families and stuff like that
[1:27:35.320 --> 1:27:40.120]  where it's you know and again it's kind of a meme but you'll see stuff where
[1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:45.000]  where it's like no no you you don't subtract 111 from 217 like that
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:48.120]  you have to do this from that and this from that and then imagine that there's
[1:27:48.120 --> 1:27:50.760]  100 of these and three left over and you're I'm like
[1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:54.680]  I honestly don't know how to do math that way but I guess there's a reason
[1:27:54.680 --> 1:27:57.160]  I guess there's a reason people like you probably like you figured out a
[1:27:57.160 --> 1:28:00.680]  lot of the tricks about getting close to something and then figuring out the
[1:28:00.680 --> 1:28:03.320]  rest right you figured that out a long time ago
[1:28:03.320 --> 1:28:05.960]  you know I'm talking about like some people have that
[1:28:05.960 --> 1:28:09.960]  learn these tricks for like a quick estimation and then getting it right
[1:28:09.960 --> 1:28:13.240]  after the estimation I bet you you can go to that forever
[1:28:13.240 --> 1:28:16.760]  yeah it's always just came naturally the one thing I remember I remember
[1:28:16.760 --> 1:28:20.280]  being very proud of myself for is at some point
[1:28:20.280 --> 1:28:24.200]  I don't know when it I don't know when I learned everything but it was third
[1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:27.720]  fourth fifth grade somewhere in there probably before fifth but at some
[1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:32.280]  point but we hadn't learned long division yet as a as a class
[1:28:32.280 --> 1:28:36.280]  and we took a standardized test what do we used to take the Iowa test
[1:28:36.280 --> 1:28:41.080]  oh right yes yes yes I don't know if everybody I don't know why we took the
[1:28:41.080 --> 1:28:44.760]  Iowa test but we used to I left grew up in Pennsylvania but we took the Iowa
[1:28:44.760 --> 1:28:50.920]  test of basic skills it was like you know like the SAT for grade school kids
[1:28:50.920 --> 1:28:56.920]  and there was long division on it and I didn't I was like oh and I kind of
[1:28:56.920 --> 1:29:00.680]  had like testings idea and I was I but I somehow figured out a way to get
[1:29:00.680 --> 1:29:04.280]  the answer like I somehow taught myself long division before we ever
[1:29:04.280 --> 1:29:07.880]  learned it and I remember my teacher asked me I totally
[1:29:07.880 --> 1:29:11.480]  asked it I got like and I think the highest score it was like a percentage
[1:29:11.480 --> 1:29:15.240]  I got like a 99% on the math and my teacher asked me how'd you get how'd you get
[1:29:15.240 --> 1:29:19.640]  this one and I explained it and he was like that's a you know that's
[1:29:19.640 --> 1:29:23.080]  fascinating because that's not the right way to do it but it's it is a way to
[1:29:23.080 --> 1:29:26.360]  get the answer yes funny if you think about it when you ask somebody to show
[1:29:26.360 --> 1:29:29.000]  their work on the one hand it's completely sensible like especially
[1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:33.240]  something like long division showing your work is an indication that you
[1:29:33.240 --> 1:29:36.840]  understand how to how to solve this but what it really shows is you
[1:29:36.840 --> 1:29:40.760]  learn how to solve this in the way that I taught it
[1:29:40.760 --> 1:29:44.600]  if I mean because the thing is in in at least in arithmetic maybe not in
[1:29:44.600 --> 1:29:47.960]  higher math but arithmetic there's an an answer like this times this will
[1:29:47.960 --> 1:29:51.160]  always be that there's no quantum mechanics that the basic arithmetic
[1:29:51.160 --> 1:29:54.760]  level and so you know the thing is if you can just look at a problem like
[1:29:54.760 --> 1:29:58.840]  whatever 17 times nine and know what that answer is without having to show
[1:29:58.840 --> 1:30:02.280]  your work it seems kind of weird because you just some people just see
[1:30:02.280 --> 1:30:05.160]  those numbers I mean I really admire people who can do that where they just
[1:30:05.160 --> 1:30:08.040]  they you know what I'm talking about it's almost like like a
[1:30:08.040 --> 1:30:10.680]  rain man kind of thing where some people can just see that they don't need to
[1:30:10.680 --> 1:30:12.760]  show the work because there's no work to be shown it's just
[1:30:12.760 --> 1:30:15.880]  this will all this times that will always be that and I know that
[1:30:15.880 --> 1:30:20.040]  all right so it's just at 17 times nine I thought 153
[1:30:20.040 --> 1:30:23.240]  is that what it is yeah are you kidding
[1:30:23.240 --> 1:30:26.920]  because it's you do you just do
[1:30:26.920 --> 1:30:31.720]  asterisk no checks out 153 spot like says
[1:30:31.720 --> 1:30:34.840]  right because you do ten times you do ten times nine to get 90
[1:30:34.840 --> 1:30:39.960]  and then you do seven times nine to get 63 and you add them together
[1:30:39.960 --> 1:30:44.200]  oh my god you might as well be like telling my future from tea leaves
[1:30:44.200 --> 1:30:47.000]  I can't believe you do you know what that we had one time with the teacher
[1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:50.120]  conference this is I love I love I love I'm a new one to show but one time
[1:30:50.120 --> 1:30:53.160]  I did talk to what Jonas's teacher about it a little not in a way where I was
[1:30:53.160 --> 1:30:55.640]  trying to prescribe how I thought they should teach math
[1:30:55.640 --> 1:30:59.400]  just to express things he found on the internet
[1:30:59.400 --> 1:31:02.600]  no not at all just to just just sort of like what you're taking and her
[1:31:02.600 --> 1:31:05.880]  explanation and I do believe this is there's there's not as much
[1:31:05.880 --> 1:31:09.320]  point to memorizing this stuff going through life because
[1:31:09.320 --> 1:31:12.040]  everybody has its computers with them everywhere they go
[1:31:12.040 --> 1:31:14.520]  you know it's it's sort of like
[1:31:14.520 --> 1:31:18.040]  more or less you know and but in a way that made a lot of sense to me
[1:31:18.040 --> 1:31:22.520]  that what you know if we teach them these story-based ideas but know that
[1:31:22.520 --> 1:31:25.080]  you know on the assumption that they're going to actually use
[1:31:25.080 --> 1:31:28.920]  calculators and stuff you know to do it they'll understand
[1:31:28.920 --> 1:31:34.440]  what's actually necessary I don't know something like that
[1:31:34.440 --> 1:31:37.400]  Mike what's the point of learning all this stuff if you don't you know if
[1:31:37.400 --> 1:31:39.800]  you're never gonna actually do it by hand anyway
[1:31:39.800 --> 1:31:43.400]  we don't back to that idea though of what's what people's natural
[1:31:43.400 --> 1:31:47.960]  kind of faculties are and you do use that word story in a slightly broader
[1:31:47.960 --> 1:31:51.480]  sense I mean if you think about how many of the things you learn in elementary
[1:31:51.480 --> 1:31:54.600]  school will either be either connect with you or they won't
[1:31:54.600 --> 1:31:58.680]  based on whether you get the story so the problem is if you get history
[1:31:58.680 --> 1:32:01.080]  taught in an uninteresting way or by an uninspired
[1:32:01.080 --> 1:32:03.960]  teacher you see it as a collection of facts to be memorized
[1:32:03.960 --> 1:32:07.240]  instead of seeing that as a story you know and there's a reason why until I
[1:32:07.240 --> 1:32:10.360]  went to college I still continue to call everything
[1:32:10.360 --> 1:32:14.120]  including arithmetic just math because that was math
[1:32:14.120 --> 1:32:16.440]  not understanding there's there's a bigger story to tell here
[1:32:16.440 --> 1:32:19.240]  than plus minus you know times and divided by
[1:32:19.240 --> 1:32:21.800]  you know what I mean it's like but there are some people who really have that
[1:32:21.800 --> 1:32:24.840]  natural affinity of being able to just look at these patterns and it
[1:32:24.840 --> 1:32:29.960]  makes sense and maybe they're learning a word for what that's actually called
[1:32:29.960 --> 1:32:34.200]  but you know gosh I just feel like having to have in teachers
[1:32:34.200 --> 1:32:37.960]  who are able to to suss that out and then put up with the parents who
[1:32:37.960 --> 1:32:42.200]  come in and give them things to found in mother Jones
[1:32:42.200 --> 1:32:46.920]  what a job I do think and it sounds like it's the same
[1:32:46.920 --> 1:32:50.120]  with with your school I do feel like the one that so the math
[1:32:50.120 --> 1:32:54.200]  uh you know I don't know what do I know I I kind of think they're doing it
[1:32:54.200 --> 1:32:58.760]  wrong but whatever uh but with the writing
[1:32:58.760 --> 1:33:02.520]  I do kind of see where they're going and where I do object to the idea that
[1:33:02.520 --> 1:33:05.560]  spelling doesn't count but eventually it does start to count but I do
[1:33:05.560 --> 1:33:08.760]  that we had the same thing over there they just want the kids to write
[1:33:08.760 --> 1:33:13.720]  stories like from like first grade on and I do see that they're
[1:33:13.720 --> 1:33:17.160]  that's very different I don't remember ever just writing I mean when I was in
[1:33:17.160 --> 1:33:21.080]  first grade we used to you know I mean it was the what you were writing about
[1:33:21.080 --> 1:33:24.520]  was a McGuffin the the whole idea of having like what you did over thanks
[1:33:24.520 --> 1:33:27.160]  giving one nobody really cared what they what you did over thanks giving
[1:33:27.160 --> 1:33:29.960]  they want to make sure you could still write in cursive and you had a
[1:33:29.960 --> 1:33:33.480]  punctuated and spell it right where does now it wasn't really about
[1:33:33.480 --> 1:33:36.600]  telling a writing anything it was about demonstrating
[1:33:36.600 --> 1:33:39.320]  you had the mechanical skills you've been taught yeah
[1:33:39.320 --> 1:33:42.680]  whereas now it seems like it's more about they really want to
[1:33:42.680 --> 1:33:46.360]  train those muscles in their minds at an early age to be able to express
[1:33:46.360 --> 1:33:51.640]  take your thoughts and express them and that worrying about spelling it's
[1:33:51.640 --> 1:33:55.160]  just all it's just roadblocks to getting that out on the page
[1:33:55.160 --> 1:34:00.120]  and you know it's a professional writer there is a line there's certainly a
[1:34:00.120 --> 1:34:04.360]  very common line of advice for adult writers people writing that
[1:34:04.360 --> 1:34:08.280]  your first draft you should just go just get it on the page
[1:34:08.280 --> 1:34:12.120]  don't worry turn off the thing that makes red underlines and stuff like that
[1:34:12.120 --> 1:34:17.880]  and just go and get it out on the page and then go back and do the stuff
[1:34:17.880 --> 1:34:22.040]  like oh you didn't even uppercase that's the character to start that sentence
[1:34:22.040 --> 1:34:25.400]  you you know you misspelled some words you you know
[1:34:25.400 --> 1:34:28.840]  totally need comments to close don't worry about that in the first draft
[1:34:28.840 --> 1:34:32.040]  I don't really write like that I kind of well because you don't you don't need to
[1:34:32.040 --> 1:34:34.920]  but but what you're described I totally agree with you because well
[1:34:34.920 --> 1:34:40.680]  I feel like and I might be oversimplifying this but I really do feel like
[1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:44.520]  something that always inhibited me a little bit was if if there was one
[1:34:44.520 --> 1:34:48.520]  thing where I got it a little bit it wasn't things like
[1:34:48.520 --> 1:34:52.760]  English language arts you know and the idea of having to write a paper
[1:34:52.760 --> 1:34:56.680]  was not the thing that worried me or was fretful to me the thing that I didn't
[1:34:56.680 --> 1:35:00.280]  like was having to go and do the process of doing the index cards
[1:35:00.280 --> 1:35:03.320]  I'd like index cards always have but having to do the index cards turn the
[1:35:03.320 --> 1:35:07.240]  index cards in to an outline that you have to turn in as part of the theme
[1:35:07.240 --> 1:35:10.840]  yeah whereas I feel like man I could write this thing in my sleep but all these
[1:35:10.840 --> 1:35:15.160]  all these other this weird artificial scaffolding that I guess proves I
[1:35:15.160 --> 1:35:18.760]  learned your process like that always got in the way and I think there's
[1:35:18.760 --> 1:35:21.560]  that still that voice in a lot of people's heads if they want to write
[1:35:21.560 --> 1:35:24.760]  anything where they're going to they're going to they would never
[1:35:24.760 --> 1:35:27.000]  million years turn off the right underlining because that's how they
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:29.240]  know they're doing it right even if it doesn't make any sense what they're
[1:35:29.240 --> 1:35:33.560]  actually writing no I that's I had the same thing like we learned in
[1:35:33.560 --> 1:35:37.320]  my school elementary school like this and it was year after year it wasn't
[1:35:37.320 --> 1:35:42.280]  just like one teacher it was like the curriculum was this sort of formal
[1:35:42.280 --> 1:35:45.480]  you mentioned the index cards I actually do I forgot about that I remember the
[1:35:45.480 --> 1:35:48.280]  outline but I do think that there was a time when we were supposed to use
[1:35:48.280 --> 1:35:51.720]  index cards too that which you went the library did your research
[1:35:51.720 --> 1:35:55.160]  right and it's a pretty prescriptive way you're supposed to make notes on
[1:35:55.160 --> 1:35:59.160]  every index card right and the outline that had weird rules like you had to
[1:35:59.160 --> 1:36:03.320]  start like with like uppercase letters and the next level of hierarchy was like
[1:36:03.320 --> 1:36:06.840]  lowercase letters not all went into the grade like if you use the numeral
[1:36:06.840 --> 1:36:10.200]  two instead of a Roman numeral two yeah place that was marked against you
[1:36:10.200 --> 1:36:13.240]  it's like what better way to disrupt somebody's thought process than
[1:36:13.240 --> 1:36:17.640]  by having them think about what kind of digit to use to brain state right
[1:36:17.640 --> 1:36:22.040]  just just to get your ideas out right and it was yeah and I remember the Roman
[1:36:22.040 --> 1:36:25.080]  numerals part because I was something that I was never good at
[1:36:25.080 --> 1:36:30.760]  absolutely never good at Roman numerals you know once I got past five it was
[1:36:30.760 --> 1:36:35.960]  you know with the whole thing where you put the ones before the digit
[1:36:35.960 --> 1:36:39.640]  never never worked for me I mean I still have to sit there and when I'm
[1:36:39.640 --> 1:36:44.760]  watching like like a Super Bowl kind of notation I still have to mentally
[1:36:44.760 --> 1:36:49.240]  sit there I can't do it the equivalent of arithmetic to figure out 39
[1:36:49.240 --> 1:36:53.080]  I have no idea if the Super Bowl is right except
[1:36:53.080 --> 1:36:57.320]  no I don't when they hit 50 50 was awesome because it was I don't even know what
[1:36:57.320 --> 1:37:04.680]  it was but it's just like an L or something like Cm I don't know I hate the
[1:37:04.680 --> 1:37:09.240]  Super Bowl with the Roman numerals just freaking I've I really I wish I would have
[1:37:09.240 --> 1:37:12.680]  made like a public campaign for it I you know it's really unnecessarily
[1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:17.960]  pretentious given the audience once they get the same spancy
[1:37:17.960 --> 1:37:23.000]  but once they hit 50 that's where they should have stopped and just you know
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:29.560]  just Super Bowl 2014 Super Bowl 2015 Super Bowl ugly numbers it's all ugly at
[1:37:29.560 --> 1:37:34.520]  this point it's really bad it it was it only made sense it's like with the
[1:37:34.520 --> 1:37:37.960]  Rocky films yeah they use Roman numerals never go beyond the number of Rocky
[1:37:37.960 --> 1:37:39.800]  films that you know what that's Gruber's rule
[1:37:39.800 --> 1:37:43.400]  you know yeah it's your dude if you need more than that you use a
[1:37:43.400 --> 1:37:47.960]  use a numeral that's yeah exactly Rocky the upper bound
[1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:51.480]  on on Roman numerals is where that was like seven something like that
[1:37:51.480 --> 1:37:53.880]  nine twelve how many I don't know but they made the most
[1:37:53.880 --> 1:37:56.760]  reason one they didn't put a Roman numeral behind even they wouldn't break
[1:37:56.760 --> 1:38:00.200]  the Rocky rule like they stopped adding Roman numerals and made like in a
[1:38:00.200 --> 1:38:02.760]  Rocky forever or something Rocky Balboa
[1:38:02.760 --> 1:38:05.480]  yeah yeah that's it Rocky Balboa
[1:38:05.480 --> 1:38:09.160]  Rocky why look at that guy look at the head on that guy
[1:38:09.160 --> 1:38:12.840]  Rocky films god I love Wikipedia I'm looking at it right now
[1:38:12.840 --> 1:38:16.760]  here we go they went to Rocky five that's a and then they went to Rocky Balboa
[1:38:16.760 --> 1:38:20.680]  Creed it's one called Creed that must be upcoming
[1:38:20.680 --> 1:38:22.920]  I think I heard about this
[1:38:22.920 --> 1:38:25.240]  it's been off
[1:38:25.240 --> 1:38:29.880]  uh it's Creed's grandson Michael B Jordan is up the guy from the wire
[1:38:29.880 --> 1:38:35.320]  yeah I think so damn look at that it's uh it's what's his name it says at Wallace
[1:38:35.320 --> 1:38:39.240]  that's Wallace Wallace is everywhere now this is crazy
[1:38:39.240 --> 1:38:44.760]  yeah jeez so they went to Rocky five
[1:38:44.760 --> 1:38:47.320]  and then like that's it you know what I you know I'm just gonna say on the
[1:38:47.320 --> 1:38:52.040]  strength I'm okay with seven I think eight is ugly I think nine is
[1:38:52.040 --> 1:38:55.640]  excreable I don't want to I don't want to look at an Ix
[1:38:55.640 --> 1:38:58.760]  see when you start going before the numbers uh that's just we stick
[1:38:58.760 --> 1:39:01.960]  although I think I told you this when I was a kid our creature feature
[1:39:01.960 --> 1:39:08.120]  was on WXIX channel 19 which you gotta give him credit that's pretty great
[1:39:08.120 --> 1:39:13.400]  XIX yeah yeah because it's you know it's got like a nice uh
[1:39:13.400 --> 1:39:18.840]  what's that called uh to clever by half now but uh uh palant palindrome
[1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:21.800]  that's a pallet yeah right right right
[1:39:21.800 --> 1:39:25.640]  a symmetry pallet yeah exactly there's a there's a there's a pretty visual
[1:39:25.640 --> 1:39:28.920]  symmetry mm
[1:39:28.920 --> 1:39:32.040]  the Roman neural system I mean how
[1:39:32.040 --> 1:39:37.800]  how did they even how did it's amazing that a culture that came up with
[1:39:37.800 --> 1:39:42.520]  that had any success at all let alone uh like a continent spanning empire
[1:39:42.520 --> 1:39:47.320]  oh hundred percent it really seems like the kind of thing you make deliberately
[1:39:47.320 --> 1:39:52.520]  difficult to confuse normal people it's like one two and three
[1:39:52.520 --> 1:39:55.640]  all right all right you're I'm with you so let me spin here's how it works this is
[1:39:55.640 --> 1:39:58.600]  a one okay it's one mark here's here's the two
[1:39:58.600 --> 1:40:02.280]  okay you make two marks can you guess what three is is it three marks yep
[1:40:02.280 --> 1:40:07.480]  and uh what about four that's IV right immediately what's a V hang on we're not
[1:40:07.480 --> 1:40:11.000]  there yet first learn IV you gotta learn IV before you learn V
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:15.720]  right at that point in the discussion you only have to get to IV before you
[1:40:15.720 --> 1:40:18.440]  automatically
[1:40:18.440 --> 1:40:23.080]  like whoever came up with it you gotta say no it's uh I think that's a it's like a
[1:40:23.080 --> 1:40:25.640]  Turing thing it's like it just it doesn't make sense
[1:40:25.640 --> 1:40:31.480]  all right you have to know about five would you have where you know about four
[1:40:31.480 --> 1:40:34.520]  it's like those directions where like you realize you should have read them all
[1:40:34.520 --> 1:40:38.200]  the way through before you started yeah we like you know it has something
[1:40:38.200 --> 1:40:43.560]  you were supposed to have done back in step four it's exactly exactly that's
[1:40:43.560 --> 1:40:49.080]  probably why my cable went up uh I skipped skip step uh I didn't read step eight
[1:40:49.080 --> 1:40:52.440]  before I did step six um now but you know how it's like
[1:40:52.440 --> 1:40:57.080]  like our our decimal notation it breaks down after a certain large number
[1:40:57.080 --> 1:40:59.800]  and that's why we switched to the exponential notation
[1:40:59.800 --> 1:41:04.040]  for very very large numbers and you know that's and that's something
[1:41:04.040 --> 1:41:07.560]  I'd never made sense to me or it made sense but I always had to
[1:41:07.560 --> 1:41:11.320]  go back and look it up and it's just the telling you how many zeros are on the
[1:41:11.320 --> 1:41:15.320]  10 or something but it's because you know for dealing with
[1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:19.080]  those truly staggeringly large numbers writing it all out doesn't make
[1:41:19.080 --> 1:41:22.840]  sense Roman numerals break down at four
[1:41:22.840 --> 1:41:26.760]  yeah it's one thing with pie like people have their reasons for wanting to
[1:41:26.760 --> 1:41:29.800]  get in 50 to 50 places in pie and that's a level of complexity
[1:41:29.800 --> 1:41:33.000]  that we accept even if not to always totally understand
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:38.120]  but to have an idea of him fucking broken four that's I mean what it
[1:41:38.120 --> 1:41:42.520]  seems like that that's a good first draft but let's try that again
[1:41:42.520 --> 1:41:46.200]  now can you do four single strokes is that acceptable as an alternative
[1:41:46.200 --> 1:41:53.480]  I think IVs canonical I think I as I recall I believe that it's it's uh
[1:41:53.480 --> 1:41:57.000]  it's sort of like the in an English language it's like it's going to get the
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:02.760]  the italicized informal oh the INF yeah yeah I think you're right
[1:42:02.760 --> 1:42:06.280]  yeah well I don't know if you know but I'm a third
[1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:09.160]  I am a my my father and my grandfather share my name
[1:42:09.160 --> 1:42:13.000]  where I share their name I should say so I've had to I've had to live with walking
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:15.560]  around putting Roman numerals after my name
[1:42:15.560 --> 1:42:19.720]  and nothing has to run a bigger dick faster than having Roman numerals
[1:42:19.720 --> 1:42:23.960]  after your name that's always the bad guy in like an 80s 80s comedy
[1:42:23.960 --> 1:42:27.560]  for legal purposes you you you have to other dead now
[1:42:27.560 --> 1:42:30.760]  so I think I can fly on that a little better yeah but I'm sitting here and look at
[1:42:30.760 --> 1:42:35.720]  this one is an eye five is a V 10 is an X 50 is an L
[1:42:35.720 --> 1:42:39.240]  so you can't even do XXXX X
[1:42:39.240 --> 1:42:42.840]  so I was right it was there was the one glorious year
[1:42:42.840 --> 1:42:45.800]  where the super it was like super bowl L
[1:42:45.800 --> 1:42:49.080]  right but even that it was at least it was understandable but even that it
[1:42:49.080 --> 1:42:52.360]  kind of looks stupid right because when you think that's also a sample
[1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:56.760]  right when you pull out you you think a lot of X's
[1:42:56.760 --> 1:43:00.280]  and uh right you know and you know what I'm one of the reasons I feel like
[1:43:00.280 --> 1:43:04.600]  it's stuck is that X I you know I've said this many times in the show X is
[1:43:04.600 --> 1:43:07.560]  clearly the coolest letter the alphabet yeah absolutely like
[1:43:07.560 --> 1:43:11.800]  the whole logic behind calling the MAC operating system
[1:43:11.800 --> 1:43:15.880]  OS 10 is just that the X looks cool it's got it's got
[1:43:15.880 --> 1:43:19.640]  diagonals and diagonals look great it's just diagonals
[1:43:19.640 --> 1:43:23.800]  yeah it's an across it looks super X-ray vision
[1:43:23.800 --> 1:43:30.520]  you know that's you know the the letter for secret agents X-rated films
[1:43:30.520 --> 1:43:34.440]  you know right it's you know that's what you get on the smoker channels
[1:43:34.440 --> 1:43:37.240]  I mean you get your smokers that's right uh
[1:43:37.240 --> 1:43:40.520]  no it's been and I feel like that's why the super bowl stuck with that
[1:43:40.520 --> 1:43:42.360]  because they got to put a lot of X's in the name
[1:43:42.360 --> 1:43:47.400]  why did they always do Roman numerals for years on old movies
[1:43:47.400 --> 1:43:51.000]  is that you think that's a tradition or a rule or like an industry thing
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:53.960]  you know what I mean when you see for the year yeah they would always show on
[1:43:53.960 --> 1:43:58.600]  TV shows and movies to show the year was made it would always be in Roman numerals
[1:43:58.600 --> 1:44:02.440]  I think it was just like a format you know like uh
[1:44:02.440 --> 1:44:08.120]  like a uh like a tradition yeah yeah I think it was just like a tradition
[1:44:08.120 --> 1:44:13.640]  Tarantino did it I want to his uh like a retro like that roadhouse
[1:44:13.640 --> 1:44:16.280]  movie wherever the hell it was called yeah when you see it like a title
[1:44:16.280 --> 1:44:20.680]  screen that's got a Roman numeral date on it that that really is like a throwback
[1:44:20.680 --> 1:44:25.160]  yeah click the expendables maybe can't tell yeah I don't know let me take a break
[1:44:25.160 --> 1:44:27.800]  I got another sponsor to talk about I don't want to I want to tell you
[1:44:27.800 --> 1:44:31.160]  everybody about them it's another long-time friend of the show return
[1:44:31.160 --> 1:44:36.920]  sponsor are good friends at igloo igloo now they that's the intranet
[1:44:36.920 --> 1:44:43.000]  you'll actually like uh it's built with easy to use apps like shared calendars
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:47.720]  Twitter like micro blogs file sharing task management and more so you put your team
[1:44:47.720 --> 1:44:52.040]  together you start your own little uh Twitter micro blog thing on igloo and it's
[1:44:52.040 --> 1:44:56.440]  like you have a Twitter that is private to your team instead of being out in the
[1:44:56.440 --> 1:45:02.920]  public but that way you can just comment on things uh keep it all in your within your
[1:45:02.920 --> 1:45:06.920]  team for you know privacy purposes it's everything you need to work better
[1:45:06.920 --> 1:45:12.280]  in one very configurable cloud platform now they have responsive design
[1:45:12.280 --> 1:45:17.160]  everything works great on your phone your Android phone your iOS device
[1:45:17.160 --> 1:45:23.160]  your tablet your laptop obviously um it works great with the bigger screen
[1:45:23.160 --> 1:45:28.920]  iPhones right away it's all you know responsive uh you can review documents
[1:45:28.920 --> 1:45:34.200]  you post project updates change administrative settings uh or even
[1:45:34.200 --> 1:45:37.160]  complain about why they you know there's a you two album stuck in your
[1:45:37.160 --> 1:45:40.680]  iTunes right there from your phone everything you can do on igloo you can do
[1:45:40.680 --> 1:45:44.680]  right from the phone uh when you design your igloo you have a whole
[1:45:44.680 --> 1:45:51.320]  bunch of choices you get to change uh the changes you make carry across all
[1:45:51.320 --> 1:45:55.720]  devices so it's not just like oh there's a one special look for the iPhone
[1:45:55.720 --> 1:45:58.440]  but then when you make the design changes you only see them on the desktop
[1:45:58.440 --> 1:46:02.840]  no the design changes you make go all the way from your
[1:46:02.840 --> 1:46:07.480]  brand new retina iMac right down to your iPhone uh they have a file preview
[1:46:07.480 --> 1:46:13.960]  engine fully HTML5 compatible uh so you can preview everything online yeah
[1:46:13.960 --> 1:46:17.160]  add comments new versions of files everything you
[1:46:17.160 --> 1:46:21.000]  want to do um here's the thing they want to talk about this thing called
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:25.960]  gartner's magic quadrant now this is all outside my wheelhouse this is the
[1:46:25.960 --> 1:46:30.840]  case these terms is out in the parking lot for me but uh but it's a big deal for
[1:46:30.840 --> 1:46:34.680]  for uh people who work you know probably a lot of you who are listening to
[1:46:34.680 --> 1:46:37.800]  the show who work out there uh and where you
[1:46:37.800 --> 1:46:41.080]  you know things like white papers or things you encounter all the time
[1:46:41.080 --> 1:46:45.640]  uh so just this past week gartner released their famed magic
[1:46:45.640 --> 1:46:49.160]  quadrant for social software in the workplace
[1:46:49.160 --> 1:46:52.920]  that's a white paper they put out um every year
[1:46:52.920 --> 1:46:56.280]  igloo appears for the sixth consecutive year
[1:46:56.280 --> 1:46:58.520]  and it's right alongside this is who they're up there with
[1:46:58.520 --> 1:47:03.080]  Microsoft IBM Google VMware Salesforce and
[1:47:03.080 --> 1:47:08.520]  SAP so it's a report that values the size of the vendor
[1:47:08.520 --> 1:47:13.000]  and gartner's terms this is viability igloo is praised for their
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:16.600]  responsiveness and customer experience um here's an
[1:47:16.600 --> 1:47:20.200]  excerpt right from the gartner's profile of igloo this is gartner's
[1:47:20.200 --> 1:47:23.640]  words feedback from igloo's reference customers was
[1:47:23.640 --> 1:47:27.080]  consistently positive they praised the products quick deployment
[1:47:27.080 --> 1:47:32.120]  configuration and customization flexibility with self-service options
[1:47:32.120 --> 1:47:35.400]  for non-technical users control over branding
[1:47:35.400 --> 1:47:39.480]  and information organization and ease of use they also praise the
[1:47:39.480 --> 1:47:43.400]  responsiveness of igloo as an organization
[1:47:43.400 --> 1:47:47.640]  so really there it is right there it's a third party you know gartner
[1:47:47.640 --> 1:47:51.080]  telling you exactly the things that i've been telling you about igloo for
[1:47:51.080 --> 1:47:54.680]  they're telling you uh igloo is all kinds of responsive
[1:47:54.680 --> 1:47:58.600]  right and well what it is is it's easy it's supposed to ask their whole
[1:47:58.600 --> 1:47:59.960]  point their whole point is that all these
[1:47:59.960 --> 1:48:04.120]  intranets these legacy ones like SharePoint and the old portal technology
[1:48:04.120 --> 1:48:06.680]  were a huge pain in the ass they were confusing to set up
[1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:10.440]  confusing to administer and confusing as hell to use
[1:48:10.440 --> 1:48:13.720]  that's the big thing i think is that they were confused i remember it i
[1:48:13.720 --> 1:48:16.520]  when i had you know had jobs and we used the
[1:48:16.520 --> 1:48:20.520]  always all those kinds of apps always even if you got the open source ones
[1:48:20.520 --> 1:48:23.560]  you always kind of felt like it was the worst of every world
[1:48:23.560 --> 1:48:25.960]  they were they were difficult to deal with they were some they were real
[1:48:25.960 --> 1:48:29.560]  flimsy they were real ugly to use and nobody wanted to use them
[1:48:29.560 --> 1:48:32.120]  and it wasn't just that they weren't fun it was just that you
[1:48:32.120 --> 1:48:34.840]  every time you i would use those kinds of apps i would think like
[1:48:34.840 --> 1:48:38.840]  i don't understand who this is for and i've used igloo and like you
[1:48:38.840 --> 1:48:41.720]  understand it you go in there you turn on the stuff you need turn off the
[1:48:41.720 --> 1:48:44.600]  stuff you don't you get exactly what you want and it actually
[1:48:44.600 --> 1:48:48.120]  works and it is fun to use right it's you know it's to me it's like the
[1:48:48.120 --> 1:48:50.760]  difference between like the old smartphones before the iPhone
[1:48:50.760 --> 1:48:53.880]  and it would be all these things you know i don't even know what this is
[1:48:53.880 --> 1:48:56.920]  what is this how do i even make an event in the calendar i don't even
[1:48:56.920 --> 1:49:00.920]  how to get there uh and then you got the iPhone and it's like well i get it
[1:49:00.920 --> 1:49:04.200]  just i just tap this calendar and there's my calendar and i hit this
[1:49:04.200 --> 1:49:07.960]  button i go back to home well igloo is like that for team sharing
[1:49:07.960 --> 1:49:11.400]  here's the thing that's amazing to me free to use
[1:49:11.400 --> 1:49:16.600]  with up to ten people so if you have a small team it's less than ten people
[1:49:16.600 --> 1:49:20.600]  you just get to use it forever like in perpetuity going forward without
[1:49:20.600 --> 1:49:25.160]  even paying for it they're cool with that um and if you are from a bigger
[1:49:25.160 --> 1:49:29.000]  organization you can try it out with up to ten people
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:32.360]  before you spend a nickel to make sure that everything i'm telling you about
[1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:36.520]  it is true uh and then they have really great you know once you go past ten
[1:49:36.520 --> 1:49:39.400]  people they have really really great rates that are way way
[1:49:39.400 --> 1:49:41.800]  less than you pay for competing crappier
[1:49:41.800 --> 1:49:46.840]  internets where do you go here's the here's the address igloo software
[1:49:46.840 --> 1:49:52.200]  dot com slash the talk show igloo software
[1:49:52.200 --> 1:49:55.800]  dot com slash the talk show and then they'll know you came
[1:49:55.800 --> 1:49:59.560]  right here from the show so my thanks to them
[1:49:59.560 --> 1:50:04.280]  good people really good people mcm
[1:50:04.280 --> 1:50:08.760]  lx vi that's the year i was born
[1:50:08.760 --> 1:50:13.960]  what a mess it's horrible why
[1:50:13.960 --> 1:50:18.360]  i almost feel like it's one of those things like dropping in some casual
[1:50:18.360 --> 1:50:21.400]  latin where it's exactly what it's like
[1:50:21.400 --> 1:50:24.280]  or i'm specifically mentioning this because i'm pretty sure you won't know what
[1:50:24.280 --> 1:50:28.360]  it means to each generous right and i'd spend a lot of
[1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:31.480]  a lot of time uh... learning it
[1:50:31.480 --> 1:50:35.800]  so uh... now i don't want to sell fancy per se
[1:50:35.800 --> 1:50:37.400]  right
[1:50:37.400 --> 1:50:40.320]  just dropping in some room in numerals
[1:50:40.320 --> 1:50:43.880]  and i kept this uh... nervous orders of quorum um...
[1:50:43.880 --> 1:50:48.040]  it's kind of a thing it's on my mind right now
[1:50:48.040 --> 1:50:49.880]  how's your internet doing
[1:50:49.880 --> 1:50:52.520]  uh... i think it's good nice
[1:50:52.520 --> 1:50:54.520]  hey so uh...
[1:50:54.520 --> 1:50:57.240]  before we before we wrap this up uh...
[1:50:57.240 --> 1:51:00.200]  now i want to i don't want to say anything it's your show but uh... you know i've
[1:51:00.200 --> 1:51:01.800]  noticed
[1:51:01.800 --> 1:51:03.400]  yet some length creep
[1:51:03.400 --> 1:51:06.200]  and i don't know if it's not it's not just i would be nice to think that it's
[1:51:06.200 --> 1:51:09.400]  just Syracuse uh... who i'm guessing broken down
[1:51:09.400 --> 1:51:13.240]  but there's been a lot of a lot of leakage time wise lately
[1:51:13.240 --> 1:51:16.760]  yeah i don't know what to do about that i'm not i'm not against it but i think
[1:51:16.760 --> 1:51:20.120]  now yeah given that we're not talking about ecosystems it's probably better we
[1:51:20.120 --> 1:51:23.560]  keep this one short but uh... you know that well now let's go meta on it though
[1:51:23.560 --> 1:51:27.400]  that is good though it i do i've absolutely positive there's no denying
[1:51:27.400 --> 1:51:32.200]  it this show has gotten longer where i used to try to keep it to be an hour
[1:51:32.200 --> 1:51:35.160]  because i thought an hour is what a show i did
[1:51:35.160 --> 1:51:37.880]  i've never done anything for an hour
[1:51:37.880 --> 1:51:41.320]  i've never done anything physical for more than an hour
[1:51:41.320 --> 1:51:44.520]  and i've never done anything involving talking for less than an hour
[1:51:44.520 --> 1:51:51.160]  i i'd i never i almost never hit that uh... hour
[1:51:51.160 --> 1:51:52.280]  but
[1:51:52.280 --> 1:51:59.000]  i by trying to keep it an hour i felt like it would um...
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:02.680]  you know it would keep it from going to two hours and then you know it would be
[1:52:02.680 --> 1:52:05.880]  like an hour and thirty seven minutes or an hour and forty five minutes
[1:52:05.880 --> 1:52:10.040]  and now it just blows past the two-hour mark every show
[1:52:10.040 --> 1:52:13.880]  and a lot of people love it and here's the funny thing too
[1:52:13.880 --> 1:52:18.360]  i and i think part of it comes to the fact that that podcasting is still
[1:52:18.360 --> 1:52:20.840]  uh... like a nascent
[1:52:20.840 --> 1:52:26.280]  medium like nobody's still
[1:52:26.280 --> 1:52:29.160]  it's still it is it
[1:52:29.160 --> 1:52:33.080]  are our idea of what they should be and when people will listen to them and how
[1:52:33.080 --> 1:52:36.360]  often i'll listen to this it it's still liquid
[1:52:36.360 --> 1:52:39.800]  you know and i think online videos were when i first started i did the thing
[1:52:39.800 --> 1:52:42.840]  briefly called the Merlin show which is an interview show i did for a while it was
[1:52:42.840 --> 1:52:44.360]  tremendous amount of work
[1:52:44.360 --> 1:52:47.560]  for what we ended up getting but everything i heard from people was you can't put
[1:52:47.560 --> 1:52:49.960]  this thing up you can't have a youtube video
[1:52:49.960 --> 1:52:53.480]  that's more than ten minutes long there is nobody in the entire world that will
[1:52:53.480 --> 1:52:54.600]  watch a video
[1:52:54.600 --> 1:52:56.840]  ten minutes really that's like the stairway to heaven
[1:52:56.840 --> 1:53:00.200]  of online videos and it's like i don't know i think a fifteen minute
[1:53:00.200 --> 1:53:03.160]  interview is not that much to expect with somebody but people just shake their
[1:53:03.160 --> 1:53:05.000]  heads data for podcasts
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:07.800]  i don't know if you remember this but a lot of the advice i heard early on
[1:53:07.800 --> 1:53:09.800]  was never go past thirty minutes
[1:53:09.800 --> 1:53:14.760]  just because the files are so big and nobody will send anything for that one
[1:53:14.760 --> 1:53:15.800]  there's uh...
[1:53:15.800 --> 1:53:20.680]  there are technical factors like how long it takes to download and how much
[1:53:20.680 --> 1:53:25.640]  it costs to distribute and you know multiply the link that show by the
[1:53:25.640 --> 1:53:30.120]  number of people doing it and uh... the quality of the audio you know
[1:53:30.120 --> 1:53:32.520]  especially that when we were everybody was hosting it themselves with
[1:53:32.520 --> 1:53:35.960]  meter bandwidth i mean that was a create the pre-libs in days
[1:53:35.960 --> 1:53:40.440]  and this is not that long ago i mean we're talking like five six years ago
[1:53:40.440 --> 1:53:43.800]  yeah like five six seven years ago uh...
[1:53:43.800 --> 1:53:48.200]  uh... it was a huge when when dan and i first started doing the talk show it
[1:53:48.200 --> 1:53:51.800]  was just the download costs was a huge thing it really was
[1:53:51.800 --> 1:53:56.440]  well if you think about it it was closer in in in relatively speaking
[1:53:56.440 --> 1:53:59.800]  in the in the grand scheme of things it was closer in time to the days of postage
[1:53:59.800 --> 1:54:03.080]  stamp size quick time videos then of like like i just watched uh...
[1:54:03.080 --> 1:54:06.360]  a timnerics to tino's commercial intain eighty p
[1:54:06.360 --> 1:54:08.600]  and i watched it like five times and i don't think they're going to be hurting
[1:54:08.600 --> 1:54:09.800]  because i did that
[1:54:09.800 --> 1:54:12.840]  youtube can handle that really seriously wouldn't podcast started and i want
[1:54:12.840 --> 1:54:14.400]  to get my first libs in account
[1:54:14.400 --> 1:54:16.520]  it was the first thing i knew of i mean i'm you know you can get this to an
[1:54:16.520 --> 1:54:19.320]  extent with squarespace libson was the first one i knew of the head unmetered
[1:54:19.320 --> 1:54:20.200]  bandwidth
[1:54:20.200 --> 1:54:24.520]  which seemed completely untenable because it was so expensive
[1:54:24.520 --> 1:54:26.760]  if you had on your hosted account just sitting there
[1:54:26.760 --> 1:54:30.360]  your bandwidth would be gone in an hour even if your show wasn't that popular
[1:54:30.360 --> 1:54:33.640]  you're done yeah you couldn't have a thirty-meg file the more than a few people
[1:54:33.640 --> 1:54:35.160]  downloaded
[1:54:35.160 --> 1:54:39.800]  yeah and there's things to like uh...
[1:54:39.800 --> 1:54:43.000]  fact that people listen using different uh...
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:47.320]  apps so the one person might have two or three downloads of the show because
[1:54:47.320 --> 1:54:51.640]  they've got one in itunes at their work and they've got one in itunes at
[1:54:51.640 --> 1:54:52.680]  their home
[1:54:52.680 --> 1:54:56.040]  and one in overcast on their phone
[1:54:56.040 --> 1:54:59.560]  and you know it really really adds up at some point but it
[1:54:59.560 --> 1:55:04.280]  today's world it's you know the bandwidth is effectively free
[1:55:04.280 --> 1:55:05.800]  which is crazy
[1:55:05.800 --> 1:55:10.200]  uh... we i used to get we used to get complaints a lot when we went over an hour
[1:55:10.200 --> 1:55:14.200]  people would say man i love your show but you got to keep it under an hour
[1:55:14.200 --> 1:55:16.200]  on the uh... show tan
[1:55:16.200 --> 1:55:18.600]  or yes this this version
[1:55:18.600 --> 1:55:19.480]  uh...
[1:55:19.480 --> 1:55:23.320]  no not this version yeah i'd buy the time because this version i think we
[1:55:23.320 --> 1:55:26.920]  uh... is it coming up on two years i think it's coming up i mean like like i'm
[1:55:26.920 --> 1:55:31.640]  off top of my head circus uh... guiding readers uh... statecory guy
[1:55:31.640 --> 1:55:35.080]  like those all three of those were really good episodes they were really good
[1:55:35.080 --> 1:55:38.120]  talk show episodes i'd bet not one of them was under two hours
[1:55:38.120 --> 1:55:40.280]  no near cus was over three hours
[1:55:40.280 --> 1:55:42.200]  yeah circuit was like three of three
[1:55:42.200 --> 1:55:44.440]  uh... those are all three really good
[1:55:44.440 --> 1:55:46.600]  and it was for for
[1:55:46.600 --> 1:55:50.680]  you know and dave whiskers actually really does edit the show and a lot of
[1:55:50.680 --> 1:55:54.200]  times that the the version that gets published is a little shorter than what
[1:55:54.200 --> 1:55:58.920]  is recorded but uh... the circuit issue we recorded
[1:55:58.920 --> 1:56:00.920]  the day before this
[1:56:00.920 --> 1:56:03.800]  co-co-conference in philly was going to happen
[1:56:03.800 --> 1:56:06.600]  co-co-love which actually was a remarkably good it was just a little
[1:56:06.600 --> 1:56:10.600]  hundred and fifty person indi mac developer conference here in philly
[1:56:10.600 --> 1:56:14.280]  uh... it was really really great i can't can't believe it was the first
[1:56:14.280 --> 1:56:17.960]  instance of it all that's great it was that's great to hear
[1:56:17.960 --> 1:56:22.680]  uh... i love that still thriving you know i've been to first conferences and
[1:56:22.680 --> 1:56:25.960]  they're never there always they're cool like the first singleton
[1:56:25.960 --> 1:56:29.960]  was great but like the second singleton was way better because they had like
[1:56:29.960 --> 1:56:33.080]  you know they knew like fifteen things to do better they knew to get a better
[1:56:33.080 --> 1:56:33.880]  venue
[1:56:33.880 --> 1:56:36.600]  everything this co-co-love conference i can't believe it was the first one
[1:56:36.600 --> 1:56:40.840]  because it was like a really great venue and everything ran on time and
[1:56:40.840 --> 1:56:42.920]  really great but anyway dave
[1:56:42.920 --> 1:56:47.560]  was speaking at it uh... and Brent simmons was flying in
[1:56:47.560 --> 1:56:51.400]  so and he needed you know he was going to spend but i really wanted to show
[1:56:51.400 --> 1:56:53.800]  to come out that day friday so
[1:56:53.800 --> 1:56:57.560]  sir qson i recorded knowing we better not screw up hopefully we won't you know
[1:56:57.560 --> 1:57:00.600]  we don't want to have any kind of necessary edits
[1:57:00.600 --> 1:57:04.040]  uh... so three of three was like
[1:57:04.040 --> 1:57:05.080]  that was
[1:57:05.080 --> 1:57:07.720]  i don't think that i don't think dave would have cut anything though but we
[1:57:07.720 --> 1:57:09.960]  were you know it was a very tight show
[1:57:09.960 --> 1:57:12.920]  he's uh... he's very compact i mean you'll remember that when he and Dan
[1:57:12.920 --> 1:57:14.600]  talked about uh...
[1:57:14.600 --> 1:57:15.800]  good fellas
[1:57:15.800 --> 1:57:19.160]  i mean it was an hour longer than the movie
[1:57:19.160 --> 1:57:22.280]  crazy but awesome
[1:57:22.280 --> 1:57:25.080]  if they're ever if ever you know sir i i'd
[1:57:25.080 --> 1:57:28.040]  it sounds crazy that your discussion of a movie would be longer than the
[1:57:28.040 --> 1:57:30.920]  movie but if ever it happened with us and uh...
[1:57:30.920 --> 1:57:35.400]  most of the one we did uh... clangary clangross it's actually easier than you'd think
[1:57:35.400 --> 1:57:39.640]  yeah well because you can you know if it's a really if it's really a good
[1:57:39.640 --> 1:57:43.160]  movie there are details there's little things that go by like this in the
[1:57:43.160 --> 1:57:46.920]  movie you know in a snap but that if you really stop and think about a
[1:57:46.920 --> 1:57:50.520]  worth uh... a lengthy discuss and especially if you're somebody like
[1:57:50.520 --> 1:57:53.880]  sir cusa with that movie or me with clangary clangross maybe like
[1:57:53.880 --> 1:57:55.560]  another one for me would be like
[1:57:55.560 --> 1:57:56.760]  big labowski or
[1:57:56.760 --> 1:57:58.840]  there's certain movies where it isn't just that i like them
[1:57:58.840 --> 1:58:00.520]  it isn't just that i think they're really good
[1:58:00.520 --> 1:58:02.920]  it isn't just that i have things to say about them it's just that
[1:58:02.920 --> 1:58:06.200]  there's so many things nobody's ever bothered to ask me about that i thought
[1:58:06.200 --> 1:58:09.320]  and know you're like this there's so many things i've been thinking about
[1:58:09.320 --> 1:58:12.520]  about this thing for years that no one has ever asked me about and this is the
[1:58:12.520 --> 1:58:14.760]  only chance in the entire world i'm going to get
[1:58:14.760 --> 1:58:18.760]  to talk about this unified field theory about like you know
[1:58:18.760 --> 1:58:21.480]  in your case like a single point perspective with stealing cuba like how
[1:58:21.480 --> 1:58:23.240]  many times when you get to talk about that
[1:58:23.240 --> 1:58:26.200]  how many times you get to talk about the waste steven spielberg uses
[1:58:26.200 --> 1:58:28.520]  thirds of the screen it's like i'm probably the only person
[1:58:28.520 --> 1:58:33.560]  never noticed this but like i got a lot to say about it
[1:58:33.560 --> 1:58:36.360]  absolutely i'd you know and
[1:58:36.360 --> 1:58:39.400]  like i said rewind a little bit in the early days we used to get complaints
[1:58:39.400 --> 1:58:42.520]  when we go over an hour uh... from some people and i understood it
[1:58:42.520 --> 1:58:45.480]  because i totally see like i you know it
[1:58:45.480 --> 1:58:51.320]  and i don't want to be uh... corny about this but it is
[1:58:51.320 --> 1:58:54.760]  in a way that it's an honor that people read my stuff and read my writing
[1:58:54.760 --> 1:58:59.160]  it's in some ways even more of an honor that people listen to this show or
[1:58:59.160 --> 1:59:02.120]  when i appear on other people's podcasts because it's even more of your time
[1:59:02.120 --> 1:59:05.880]  it takes longer to listen to a podcast just jump in and sip a little bit off of
[1:59:05.880 --> 1:59:09.480]  a hundred uh... word blog post i mean if you're going to sit down to an
[1:59:09.480 --> 1:59:12.840]  interview you've got a tuck into a syrucissa interview you better bring a
[1:59:12.840 --> 1:59:14.120]  sandwich
[1:59:14.120 --> 1:59:16.200]  but i really asked a lot of people
[1:59:16.200 --> 1:59:19.960]  jones was just saying to me about how when when he we he notices when he
[1:59:19.960 --> 1:59:23.800]  plays video games like nintendo games and they put again the cut scenes
[1:59:23.800 --> 1:59:28.680]  and they they're the characters on screen talk and they put the the sub titles
[1:59:28.680 --> 1:59:32.200]  underneath that he always reads them even though you know
[1:59:32.200 --> 1:59:35.640]  they're talking and i said you know why i said i do the same thing when i kind of
[1:59:35.640 --> 1:59:36.360]  don't
[1:59:36.360 --> 1:59:39.800]  and i said you know why i think it's because you read faster than you can listen
[1:59:39.800 --> 1:59:42.680]  and he's like yeah that's true like you've already read the dialogue before
[1:59:42.680 --> 1:59:45.800]  they're even halfway through the sentence and it's like you know so
[1:59:45.800 --> 1:59:48.680]  people can read during fireball way faster than they can listen to the show so
[1:59:48.680 --> 1:59:49.800]  it's a real honor
[1:59:49.800 --> 1:59:52.680]  and so when people would complain that the show is too long i'd think well
[1:59:52.680 --> 1:59:55.560]  you know you have a very good point because it's a privilege that you're
[1:59:55.560 --> 1:59:57.640]  giving me even an hour of your time
[1:59:57.640 --> 2:00:00.840]  but i don't get any complaints anymore i don't know if there are people out there
[2:00:00.840 --> 2:00:05.880]  listening right now who silently hate that the show has expanded in time
[2:00:05.880 --> 2:00:09.560]  you should write to me and let me know because you know i'd be interested to
[2:00:09.560 --> 2:00:12.840]  know that but what i've been hearing lately is people who
[2:00:12.840 --> 2:00:16.600]  love it you know like my feelings on this have really
[2:00:16.600 --> 2:00:19.800]  evolved i don't want to say i've gone full circle but they've gone something
[2:00:19.800 --> 2:00:23.960]  very very near to full circle circle um and the the short version is i think it
[2:00:23.960 --> 2:00:28.680]  depends a lot on what kind of show it is um you know think about it this i mean
[2:00:28.680 --> 2:00:31.240]  think about like a few listens like i've just started listening to this show on
[2:00:31.240 --> 2:00:33.480]  slate i think it's called the cultural gap fest
[2:00:33.480 --> 2:00:37.000]  and it's something like about a half hour long and i i it's perfect
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:39.560]  perfect in length because it's a you know it's almost like a radio show it's
[2:00:39.560 --> 2:00:42.520]  like professional journalist talking in an organized way and it makes a lot of
[2:00:42.520 --> 2:00:44.920]  sense and you wouldn't want it to go on for four hours
[2:00:44.920 --> 2:00:48.920]  if it's an if it's an you know part of the thing when you're listening to like
[2:00:48.920 --> 2:00:52.040]  well i'll be you know brave enough to toss myself in here but like a show
[2:00:52.040 --> 2:00:56.280]  like this a show like definitely ATP and i'll even say
[2:00:56.280 --> 2:00:59.320]  a show like roderk on the line you're there because you want to see how this
[2:00:59.320 --> 2:01:02.440]  unfolds you're not going to skip any of this like you want to see
[2:01:02.440 --> 2:01:06.120]  here's where it started what happens next where's it going to go from now
[2:01:06.120 --> 2:01:10.120]  you know what i mean and i think that's really different from the topic
[2:01:10.120 --> 2:01:14.920]  obsessed outline driven show that a lot of people have
[2:01:14.920 --> 2:01:17.640]  come up with it it can be very tight so here's how my feelings evolved
[2:01:17.640 --> 2:01:20.440]  i mean the joke i used to make when i first started doing a podcast for 43
[2:01:20.440 --> 2:01:23.640]  folders and something like 2005 so it's a pretty long time ago
[2:01:23.640 --> 2:01:27.080]  that's it a long time yeah yeah so 2005-2000 and then i started doing
[2:01:27.080 --> 2:01:30.520]  you know backbreak weekly not too long after that
[2:01:30.520 --> 2:01:33.640]  but anyhow back then the joke i always made was like
[2:01:33.640 --> 2:01:37.320]  nobody wants to listen to like three guys talk about unix for three hours
[2:01:37.320 --> 2:01:40.520]  because that's what podcasts used to seem like they were totally unedited
[2:01:40.520 --> 2:01:43.000]  they were i mean that i'm being very general here but they were
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:45.320]  they weren't edited they weren't well recorded
[2:01:45.320 --> 2:01:48.760]  and a lot of times it was people who were not used to having
[2:01:48.760 --> 2:01:51.240]  heard what their voice sounds like for a long time and they would just
[2:01:51.240 --> 2:01:55.240]  drone on and on and so for me at first it was like the 43
[2:01:55.240 --> 2:01:58.360]  floors podcast like it was rarely more than like seven or eight minutes
[2:01:58.360 --> 2:02:01.320]  because i had internalized that like that's how long this should be
[2:02:01.320 --> 2:02:03.880]  people are gonna put what puts on the right pod i guess
[2:02:03.880 --> 2:02:07.080]  that's a big file keep these small i changed a little bit over time like
[2:02:07.080 --> 2:02:10.360]  we look nice today i don't know if there's any look nice today is that
[2:02:10.360 --> 2:02:14.440]  or longer than now or they're usually like 35 minutes yeah that was
[2:02:14.440 --> 2:02:18.200]  it was very sitcom like i went listen to what for the first time in a
[2:02:18.200 --> 2:02:20.040]  long time went listen to one the other day
[2:02:20.040 --> 2:02:23.560]  for election day was it who voted went back and listen to that one
[2:02:23.560 --> 2:02:27.160]  and i cannot believe how fast it went by i was like that was it
[2:02:27.160 --> 2:02:29.960]  like i'm just settling in for the first sponsored break on talk show by this
[2:02:29.960 --> 2:02:31.240]  point you know
[2:02:31.240 --> 2:02:34.360]  but now today i have to say a show like yours
[2:02:34.360 --> 2:02:38.440]  like i don't find myself check on my watch or you know a show like um
[2:02:38.440 --> 2:02:41.880]  what's the prompt called now connected shows like that shows like ATP
[2:02:41.880 --> 2:02:45.240]  ATP give me two hours long and i'm totally fine with it i'm just there to
[2:02:45.240 --> 2:02:48.200]  listen for however long it is at at normal speed
[2:02:48.200 --> 2:02:52.200]  i do the overcast thing where i do the automatically you know clip out
[2:02:52.200 --> 2:02:56.520]  pauses part but i i never listen it artificially high speeds
[2:02:56.520 --> 2:02:59.800]  oh you don't pump it up a little bit i pump it up a little bit like a 1.1
[2:02:59.800 --> 2:03:05.480]  1.5 yeah like a 1.2 or so let's podcast end up being about 1.1 or so
[2:03:05.480 --> 2:03:10.040]  i think with um overcast but yeah you know if you get used to it it's
[2:03:10.040 --> 2:03:12.920]  no problem but certain shows where there's lots of music i turn that off
[2:03:12.920 --> 2:03:15.960]  because that drives me crazy and then i'm not like an audio file but anyway
[2:03:15.960 --> 2:03:19.240]  all i'm saying is if you bottom line yes it has changed a lot i think for
[2:03:19.240 --> 2:03:22.600]  almost every body um if people like your show they
[2:03:22.600 --> 2:03:26.520]  i mean we used to hear this on mac break weekly and frankly at that time it drove me nuts
[2:03:26.520 --> 2:03:29.720]  because they would be like oh because it once it got to like an hour hour and 15
[2:03:29.720 --> 2:03:33.880]  minutes i'd be like i've really got to pee and the show is getting away too long
[2:03:33.880 --> 2:03:37.320]  but people would be like oh good please record everything from every second
[2:03:37.320 --> 2:03:39.720]  that you're ever on the air and put it out and i was like you've got to be
[2:03:39.720 --> 2:03:42.040]  kidding me like after you've worked without a mussegore
[2:03:42.040 --> 2:03:45.560]  that is that is a state of mind it's kind of hard to grok but
[2:03:45.560 --> 2:03:49.640]  no honestly i mean you're not a huge podcast listener are you
[2:03:49.640 --> 2:03:55.400]  no because i i think the it there's so many that i i like but i just
[2:03:55.400 --> 2:03:57.880]  don't have the time in my week and that's because i don't i don't
[2:03:57.880 --> 2:04:00.440]  commute you go to vegas a lot that
[2:04:00.440 --> 2:04:03.240]  but how would that help me with podcast point
[2:04:03.240 --> 2:04:05.720]  but uh but they are you they can't be very
[2:04:05.720 --> 2:04:08.760]  tongue consuming and if you want to jump in something like the flop house
[2:04:08.760 --> 2:04:11.160]  you know to fully appreciate the flop house you got to really go back and
[2:04:11.160 --> 2:04:14.680]  listen for rod or gun line if i could say it pays to go back and listen for
[2:04:14.680 --> 2:04:18.520]  my ways back but even with a new show you get two shows that are two hours a week
[2:04:18.520 --> 2:04:20.520]  i mean that's half a work day
[2:04:20.520 --> 2:04:25.080]  no people you did this you have i have no hesitation letting you
[2:04:25.080 --> 2:04:27.720]  put rodrick on the line out there is an example of that
[2:04:27.720 --> 2:04:31.160]  this type of show that people the people who love that like that show love that
[2:04:31.160 --> 2:04:35.000]  show like i i always see people say like
[2:04:35.000 --> 2:04:38.600]  it's a common thing on twitter where if there's a somebody who's on this show
[2:04:38.600 --> 2:04:42.120]  you know my show that they really like they'll say
[2:04:42.120 --> 2:04:46.120]  i would love a rodrick on the line style show between you and insert that
[2:04:46.120 --> 2:04:49.480]  person every week wow that's a huge compliment
[2:04:49.480 --> 2:04:52.200]  like the people who most like i somebody said it was
[2:04:52.200 --> 2:04:55.160]  Syracuse with the last episode but i see you know
[2:04:55.160 --> 2:04:59.320]  other people like it when you know Joanna Stern is on with me
[2:04:59.320 --> 2:05:04.680]  just uh or show man she's so good um but we and we do i do i always think
[2:05:04.680 --> 2:05:07.080]  when i record with her i think man we have a pretty good chemistry on the
[2:05:07.080 --> 2:05:11.160]  show together um but people will say like i would just love like a rodrick on
[2:05:11.160 --> 2:05:15.640]  the line style show like it's uh a style you know it is a thing
[2:05:15.640 --> 2:05:18.840]  wow that's really cool i i had noticed that i have gotten that with you
[2:05:18.840 --> 2:05:22.280]  look nice today in the past because i think we really were one of the genre
[2:05:22.280 --> 2:05:25.080]  defining three white guys talking about nothing shows
[2:05:25.080 --> 2:05:29.400]  right but uh but no it was funny though because well the the the editing
[2:05:29.400 --> 2:05:32.040]  aesthetic of you look nice to and that show was super
[2:05:32.040 --> 2:05:35.720]  tightly edited and we have to be ridiculously ridiculously edited yeah right
[2:05:35.720 --> 2:05:39.640]  like behind the scenes it it was like
[2:05:39.640 --> 2:05:43.080]  like you're going into like the dark room and it's there's
[2:05:43.080 --> 2:05:46.520]  thousands of strips of film all over the floor
[2:05:46.520 --> 2:05:50.120]  and you know you know i guess Adam used to do a lot of the editing
[2:05:50.120 --> 2:05:52.840]  originally no Adam wasn't the editor i mean until he got
[2:05:52.840 --> 2:05:56.440]  super busy at the end he always edited it it wasn't until the show came back
[2:05:56.440 --> 2:05:59.000]  the clawed was doing it but it was always that he would
[2:05:59.000 --> 2:06:03.080]  maybe else we'll touch it all right but the thing that Adam would come out with
[2:06:03.080 --> 2:06:08.120]  was this 35 minute thing that sounded as though it was just
[2:06:08.120 --> 2:06:11.480]  scripted a lot of people thought a lot of people were like how do you guys
[2:06:11.480 --> 2:06:15.480]  would you guys write together do you use google docs are you kidding me
[2:06:15.480 --> 2:06:19.960]  a still getty playing playing testicles i mean like you think we wrote
[2:06:19.960 --> 2:06:25.880]  that it but it also it did feel
[2:06:25.880 --> 2:06:30.760]  yeah it felt written but yeah also felt so easy you know there was an
[2:06:30.760 --> 2:06:34.920]  easiness to it felt like you guys could just sit down and
[2:06:34.920 --> 2:06:38.600]  in 40 minutes come up with a 35 minute you look nice today
[2:06:38.600 --> 2:06:42.200]  just right off the cuff me and that's this one i appreciate you saying that
[2:06:42.200 --> 2:06:44.280]  and it's you know so much of it was Adam's work and
[2:06:44.280 --> 2:06:48.120]  you know i would go back and um i didn't do this
[2:06:48.120 --> 2:06:51.320]  i guess most of the time i would listen to the raw version and then listen to
[2:06:51.320 --> 2:06:53.240]  the additive version especially later on
[2:06:53.240 --> 2:06:55.880]  and it's amazing because he would take stuff and change the order of it he
[2:06:55.880 --> 2:06:57.960]  would duck stuff so that we weren't talking over each other i mean
[2:06:57.960 --> 2:06:59.960]  guess everybody all the Jason snails of the world
[2:06:59.960 --> 2:07:02.680]  i mean he believed Jason Snell like can you believe how many things or
[2:07:02.680 --> 2:07:05.080]  Dave for that matter like can you imagine sitting there and having to
[2:07:05.080 --> 2:07:07.960]  listen to this bullshit and then have to figure out where to duck
[2:07:07.960 --> 2:07:10.760]  like yeah i can i would never do that a million years so we're dropping
[2:07:10.760 --> 2:07:13.480]  completely crazy but i don't want to do that and then you go well here's a
[2:07:13.480 --> 2:07:15.080]  place where we could drop in some music or
[2:07:15.080 --> 2:07:19.640]  a sound cue or something and you know it really it
[2:07:19.640 --> 2:07:21.800]  you know i think there's one especially as the show went on
[2:07:21.800 --> 2:07:24.920]  not to you know reminisce but it got we'd now once we
[2:07:24.920 --> 2:07:29.080]  heard her at our own show edited it became clear what show to do
[2:07:29.080 --> 2:07:32.200]  while we were recording it which sounds silly but like i think they probably
[2:07:32.200 --> 2:07:34.920]  needed strictly speaking less editing as we went
[2:07:34.920 --> 2:07:38.280]  but that just gave out a more fuel to like you know make something interesting
[2:07:38.280 --> 2:07:44.360]  out of it but yeah i i i one of my theories on why the launch shows
[2:07:44.360 --> 2:07:50.840]  longer shows are getting more palatable is that people are better able to
[2:07:50.840 --> 2:07:56.120]  listen wherever whenever right like we didn't have you know when you
[2:07:56.120 --> 2:07:59.000]  you say you know what was the show you started in 2005
[2:07:59.000 --> 2:08:03.400]  there's 43 folders and then met correctly right so there were you didn't even
[2:08:03.400 --> 2:08:08.360]  have a phone that could play podcast no no no right let let alone an eight
[2:08:08.360 --> 2:08:11.240]  gigabyte phone that you could easily fill up with space like it was like
[2:08:11.240 --> 2:08:14.200]  filling a grocery bag that you didn't had to carry around all day it was it
[2:08:14.200 --> 2:08:16.920]  was an effort even with the iPod pet
[2:08:16.920 --> 2:08:20.920]  iPod there was still a fair amount of effort to keeping that up to date
[2:08:20.920 --> 2:08:24.600]  and you know now and you could run out of like who puts
[2:08:24.600 --> 2:08:27.560]  like i when i go in and i have to clear out space i always go in and start with
[2:08:27.560 --> 2:08:30.600]  something like instacaster overcast because i have four gigs of
[2:08:30.600 --> 2:08:33.480]  audio files in there right i mean think about that
[2:08:33.480 --> 2:08:37.000]  think about how crazy that is and like back then that within you know
[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:40.520]  substantial part of your your iPod could be filled up in no time
[2:08:40.520 --> 2:08:45.240]  so yeah you're right and you know it's it's commuting it's people who take
[2:08:45.240 --> 2:08:49.160]  trains and use headphones and people with cars that have some sort of
[2:08:49.160 --> 2:08:52.200]  bluetooth you know connectivity so we you know you load up your
[2:08:52.200 --> 2:08:57.480]  overcast with a bunch of shows and they're always there you don't have to do
[2:08:57.480 --> 2:09:00.840]  the stupid thing where you have to download it to your computer first and then
[2:09:00.840 --> 2:09:04.360]  yeah i guess say that untethering for my tunes is huge
[2:09:04.360 --> 2:09:08.040]  uh it's absolutely huge it's actually one of the most fundamental things
[2:09:08.040 --> 2:09:11.160]  of when the changed iOS was when you did not have to
[2:09:11.160 --> 2:09:15.000]  be hooked up to a Mac it seems like like a feature
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:18.280]  you know improvement in retrospect but like to me in retrospect like that
[2:09:18.280 --> 2:09:21.720]  that's that's when everything changed is when you get everything over the air
[2:09:21.720 --> 2:09:24.840]  i think it's largely responsible for the fact that podcasts
[2:09:24.840 --> 2:09:31.560]  are like a real part of my career now i mean it's like a significant uh
[2:09:31.560 --> 2:09:35.960]  portion of what i make it during fireball comes from this show
[2:09:35.960 --> 2:09:40.280]  and it's i think it's entirely directly corresponds to when
[2:09:40.280 --> 2:09:44.920]  iPhone's got untethered from the computer when they became full
[2:09:44.920 --> 2:09:48.440]  here i've been diagram of that podcast growing interest in doing
[2:09:48.440 --> 2:09:51.080]  fireball and yeah it's it's interesting that the year
[2:09:51.080 --> 2:09:55.560]  timing is good for that yeah and it's i think that's also why the longer
[2:09:55.560 --> 2:09:59.240]  shows are seemingly palatable it may be the people who hate them have given
[2:09:59.240 --> 2:10:01.800]  up and stopped listening i don't know but i think it's because you always
[2:10:01.800 --> 2:10:05.000]  have it with you and even if you don't have a two-hour chunk to listen to
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:07.960]  this all once you just listen to the hour first hour
[2:10:07.960 --> 2:10:11.320]  it's like you know one time when Marco was on a couple months ago i
[2:10:11.320 --> 2:10:14.840]  actually it was it went real crazy long like this over two hours and so i
[2:10:14.840 --> 2:10:17.880]  literally broke it up into two episodes oh god i remembered that that was
[2:10:17.880 --> 2:10:21.160]  with overcast that was when you put it overcast that's when i
[2:10:21.160 --> 2:10:26.680]  had like four hours right i i you know i think i was like four hours
[2:10:26.680 --> 2:10:31.400]  i think it had to be broken up but you know and it helped because i was
[2:10:31.400 --> 2:10:36.200]  behind on the sponsor you know things and you know more on that in a second
[2:10:36.200 --> 2:10:39.400]  but um you know that i'd fallen behind the schedule
[2:10:39.400 --> 2:10:42.760]  and it just i don't know just behind in the sponsor count
[2:10:42.760 --> 2:10:47.240]  yeah well it's because you know i don't have a regular that's the other thing
[2:10:47.240 --> 2:10:50.680]  too i mean i probably would help if i got more like i used to try to record
[2:10:50.680 --> 2:10:55.240]  every Thursday which is what we're doing this week um but no matter what i do
[2:10:55.240 --> 2:10:59.800]  it seems like i don't i never record more than 40 episodes a year
[2:10:59.800 --> 2:11:04.280]  like in theory i would do i would do 52 but it's pretty consistent that it
[2:11:04.280 --> 2:11:09.560]  comes out to 40 because sometimes i just it
[2:11:09.560 --> 2:11:12.760]  for show that i don't really prepare for i just come and do it
[2:11:12.760 --> 2:11:15.960]  i find it mentally exhausting like by the time i'm done talking to you here
[2:11:15.960 --> 2:11:18.600]  i'm going to be special thing we're not allowed to say
[2:11:18.600 --> 2:11:23.160]  i feel the same way i can't believe i felt tired after after recording a podcast
[2:11:23.160 --> 2:11:27.320]  sometimes all right and i i've told you this before my mother's father
[2:11:27.320 --> 2:11:31.000]  was a coal mine
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:35.160]  he is a coal miner and he worked in a black man
[2:11:35.160 --> 2:11:39.400]  and he died he died of a disease called black lung
[2:11:39.400 --> 2:11:45.240]  like at the age of 70 he died of black lungs talking about computers for two hours
[2:11:45.240 --> 2:11:49.720]  right but i remember you know what though but i remember him he was
[2:11:49.720 --> 2:11:53.960]  a very kind man and you know i was only in first grade when he died
[2:11:53.960 --> 2:11:56.840]  um but he was he was everything you'd ever want
[2:11:56.840 --> 2:12:01.000]  in a pop-pop you know he he always had like a secret stash of cookies
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:05.400]  that you know he he led on that only i knew you know that by mom and dad didn't
[2:12:05.400 --> 2:12:07.240]  have to know that i knew where he kept them
[2:12:07.240 --> 2:12:11.880]  uh i prefer pop-pop yeah pep peppers farm sugar cookies
[2:12:11.880 --> 2:12:15.160]  which is what what a great name for cookies sugar cookies
[2:12:15.160 --> 2:12:19.560]  let's let let's let uh let's let sugar cookies no actually let let's go ahead
[2:12:19.560 --> 2:12:22.120]  and sugar cookies this is literally sugar cookies
[2:12:22.120 --> 2:12:26.120]  right but this is me complaining about the exhaust how exhausting it is to
[2:12:26.120 --> 2:12:29.560]  talk to one of my best best and dearest friends for two hours and
[2:12:29.560 --> 2:12:34.920]  sky and you know i'm two generations removed from a
[2:12:34.920 --> 2:12:38.440]  man who went into a dangerous dark black hole
[2:12:38.440 --> 2:12:42.360]  a breed black dust right oh my god
[2:12:42.360 --> 2:12:45.000]  breathing black dust that would eventually kill him
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:48.200]  you know you don't even add it to sugar
[2:12:48.200 --> 2:12:52.040]  i don't even edit the show stay with us and i'm
[2:12:52.040 --> 2:12:56.440]  complaining here for everybody about how hard it is but i do i find it
[2:12:56.440 --> 2:12:59.560]  you know and somebody it does it gives me an enormous amount of respect
[2:12:59.560 --> 2:13:02.680]  for uh professional broadcasters like a Howard Stern
[2:13:02.680 --> 2:13:06.840]  who'd do it every freaking day oh and my favorite four hours six hours a day
[2:13:06.840 --> 2:13:10.760]  can you believe that yeah i cannot believe it i feel that way
[2:13:10.760 --> 2:13:14.600]  with uh morning edition where you know morning edition
[2:13:14.600 --> 2:13:17.560]  starts you guys get it starting at six in the morning it starts running here
[2:13:17.560 --> 2:13:20.760]  it's three in the morning so to get into the studio i mean those guys are
[2:13:20.760 --> 2:13:24.040]  getting what two three in the morning to record that show
[2:13:24.040 --> 2:13:27.160]  can you imagine doing that every day for like years
[2:13:27.160 --> 2:13:30.600]  for a career it's ridiculous you know i've been trying to figure out the
[2:13:30.600 --> 2:13:34.120]  chicken and egg of this uh it might interrupting here where you can do a
[2:13:34.120 --> 2:13:39.080]  no um because i was sitting here waiting for your
[2:13:39.080 --> 2:13:44.440]  cable to get fixed and thinking about you know how how strange it is the way
[2:13:44.440 --> 2:13:46.600]  the if you like ecosystem has changed
[2:13:46.600 --> 2:13:49.160]  where you know i used to feel like i really understood
[2:13:49.160 --> 2:13:52.760]  like what was going on in the world of consumer technology
[2:13:52.760 --> 2:13:56.600]  especially as it related to media right up until like you know i used to feel
[2:13:56.600 --> 2:13:59.160]  like i was really on top of that stuff i've done some work with companies
[2:13:59.160 --> 2:14:02.040]  like even like small record labels and stuff talking about hey
[2:14:02.040 --> 2:14:05.640]  here's how to really you guys you're you're facing up against my space here
[2:14:05.640 --> 2:14:09.160]  you're facing up against kazaw here here's the things to think about
[2:14:09.160 --> 2:14:12.680]  you know in terms of you know having a strategy that works for for
[2:14:12.680 --> 2:14:15.640]  moving beyond being in a Sam Goody because that was a conversation that
[2:14:15.640 --> 2:14:19.400]  really needed to be had and a lot of people didn't want to have that conversation
[2:14:19.400 --> 2:14:23.000]  what's funny is though like for me i was that guy i was the internet guy for
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:25.720]  years going oh you're gonna have to put out you got to put out high quality
[2:14:25.720 --> 2:14:29.960]  mp3s of your stuff and no DRM and that didn't happen for a really long time
[2:14:29.960 --> 2:14:34.760]  and then suddenly apple was selling no DRM mp3s
[2:14:34.760 --> 2:14:38.920]  and i was like hahaha see i was right all along and how long ago was that was that
[2:14:38.920 --> 2:14:42.840]  like maybe four years ago three years ago how to be longer than that
[2:14:42.840 --> 2:14:47.000]  what but like what did they start selling like just pure mp3s with no DRM
[2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:51.880]  when was that let's even say six years ago whatever it was
[2:14:51.880 --> 2:14:54.680]  and then i guess i went into a long-winners nap
[2:14:54.680 --> 2:14:57.800]  because then i woke up and i started seeing the numbers like so okay so
[2:14:57.800 --> 2:15:00.920]  first of all so then they start doing that then they become what the largest
[2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:04.120]  retailer music retailer in america for a while right
[2:15:04.120 --> 2:15:08.680]  wasn't that the case then the i-teen store yeah no and i'm they store
[2:15:08.680 --> 2:15:12.280]  but but you've ever watched those trend lines
[2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:16.440]  it's crazy like i was here i was being mr. futurist guy where all you got to
[2:15:16.440 --> 2:15:20.200]  do is go sell your stuff on the internet but like i can't believe how long
[2:15:20.200 --> 2:15:23.560]  it took to go from that juggernaut to now
[2:15:23.560 --> 2:15:27.800]  watching that that line go down and now as you wake up and suddenly everybody
[2:15:27.800 --> 2:15:32.120]  wants streaming and i've just i'm not been kind of running over my mind
[2:15:32.120 --> 2:15:34.920]  going like where was i was i just did that happen when my daughter was young
[2:15:34.920 --> 2:15:36.200]  and i just missed it
[2:15:36.200 --> 2:15:40.200]  but it really seems like it's so quickly went from it was this long
[2:15:40.200 --> 2:15:44.840]  tortured slide from like the late 90s you know nepsilon what have you
[2:15:44.840 --> 2:15:48.040]  out to the point of selling stuff online that seemed like it took forever
[2:15:48.040 --> 2:15:50.360]  but in my head it feels like it's been the blink of an eye
[2:15:50.360 --> 2:15:54.280]  that's really started to go away quickly yeah do you know what i mean and the
[2:15:54.280 --> 2:15:56.600]  other reason i mentioned this is like i'm trying to think about my own
[2:15:56.600 --> 2:16:00.120]  consumption of stuff we're like you know again to how long was it
[2:16:00.120 --> 2:16:03.560]  ago that we got the itunes match what couple three years ago
[2:16:03.560 --> 2:16:07.880]  probably a couple years ago yeah because Steve Jobs was still a
[2:16:07.880 --> 2:16:12.120]  little time recently as the last two years i've been still been sitting there
[2:16:12.120 --> 2:16:15.960]  with music brains like making sure i get the right mp3 data in there to get
[2:16:15.960 --> 2:16:18.760]  everything synced up and get the high quality version
[2:16:18.760 --> 2:16:23.560]  and but like at some point i stopped sweating that as much i was buying less
[2:16:23.560 --> 2:16:28.040]  i was downloading less and i was listening to a lot more podcasts and so i've
[2:16:28.040 --> 2:16:30.680]  been trying to i almost feel like i've had this last weekend
[2:16:30.680 --> 2:16:34.200]  where i'm trying to figure out where it went that i i spend most of my time
[2:16:34.200 --> 2:16:37.800]  listening to podcasts because i was absolutely not the case even like five
[2:16:37.800 --> 2:16:41.640]  years ago i would listen to music all day long or even listen to radio all day
[2:16:41.640 --> 2:16:45.240]  long i don't know i'm not saying and the reason i say chicken and egg i'm not
[2:16:45.240 --> 2:16:48.520]  saying the podcast listening is what's causing that to change
[2:16:48.520 --> 2:16:51.720]  but i wonder how much of a factor that is at least amongst people like us
[2:16:51.720 --> 2:16:54.680]  because the less we buy music the less we talk about music
[2:16:54.680 --> 2:16:57.880]  maybe it's because we're getting older but i don't know i really feel like there's
[2:16:57.880 --> 2:17:01.800]  still a there's just a huge change underway right now
[2:17:01.800 --> 2:17:04.600]  i was thinking about it with this the way that
[2:17:04.600 --> 2:17:08.920]  that streaming is clearly the future and set you know to buy
[2:17:08.920 --> 2:17:11.880]  buying music is over the last feels kind of over
[2:17:11.880 --> 2:17:16.520]  yeah the last platform for buying we i got caught up in it too where i thought
[2:17:16.520 --> 2:17:20.840]  that the way the music industry worked was every decade or so a new
[2:17:20.840 --> 2:17:25.400]  format comes along and instead of buying vinyl now you buy cassette tapes
[2:17:25.400 --> 2:17:30.040]  like when my teenage years was were it was the 80s and that's that was the
[2:17:30.040 --> 2:17:34.760]  cassette era i had all of my all of my money was tied up in cassette tapes
[2:17:34.760 --> 2:17:38.360]  and then the 90s came with CDs and it kind of sucked because i had to
[2:17:38.360 --> 2:17:41.960]  i actually did i did the thing that the music industry you know
[2:17:41.960 --> 2:17:46.920]  loves is i rebought music on CD because i wanted it on CD because it was more
[2:17:46.920 --> 2:17:51.240]  convenient because you could sort of blind yourself to the ridiculous
[2:17:51.240 --> 2:17:55.560]  cost of that back then it was what 12 13 bucks for a CD
[2:17:55.560 --> 2:17:58.280]  you could to the you could blind yourself to that by saying well
[2:17:58.280 --> 2:18:02.200]  okay on the one hand the quality of this right straight out of the box
[2:18:02.200 --> 2:18:06.040]  is going to be like twice or three times as good however you perceive it like
[2:18:06.040 --> 2:18:09.640]  the quality is going to be so much better and i now i'm never going to have to do
[2:18:09.640 --> 2:18:13.320]  this again because this is this will be you know perfect sound forever
[2:18:13.320 --> 2:18:17.160]  this this CD will last in in exactly the sound exactly the same for the next
[2:18:17.160 --> 2:18:18.280]  hundred years
[2:18:18.280 --> 2:18:21.080]  right it's never gonna wear out etc etc
[2:18:21.080 --> 2:18:24.680]  uh... and then you know digital came and it was clear that you know all
[2:18:24.680 --> 2:18:27.640]  even better it's you just downloading don't have to worry about keeping track
[2:18:27.640 --> 2:18:30.920]  of all these disks nobody can never see nobody's you never going to lose the
[2:18:30.920 --> 2:18:33.480]  disk again remember when you'd really been a mood to listen to something
[2:18:33.480 --> 2:18:37.400]  we talked about this you and i you we it's like i really you know what i really
[2:18:37.400 --> 2:18:40.440]  say you really bought Tom Petty i've rebought wezer because i didn't want to go in
[2:18:40.440 --> 2:18:43.160]  the other room
[2:18:43.160 --> 2:18:45.800]  i would go and get like i'm in the mood for
[2:18:45.800 --> 2:18:49.080]  led Zeppelin four like something you want Led Zeppelin four you got to have it
[2:18:49.080 --> 2:18:52.920]  and i'd go get the the disk and i'll or the box i have the box set open it up
[2:18:52.920 --> 2:18:57.080]  and the disk isn't in the sleeve it's like oh where is it right
[2:18:57.080 --> 2:19:00.360]  well guess what i'll go buy it again
[2:19:00.360 --> 2:19:04.040]  you know yes it's clear i and i just figured that this would be the way it
[2:19:04.040 --> 2:19:06.920]  would be whereas clearly it's just going to streaming but then i think back to
[2:19:06.920 --> 2:19:11.320]  my teenagers too is i spent a ton of time tons of time listening to fm
[2:19:11.320 --> 2:19:17.080]  radio um you know it feels like such anything beyond public radio or
[2:19:17.080 --> 2:19:22.040]  occasionally baseball but like um boy just you remember send a regular radio
[2:19:22.040 --> 2:19:25.560]  feels really foreign to me it feels like a parody of radio
[2:19:25.560 --> 2:19:28.760]  listen to it today yeah yeah it doesn't feel like the real radio anymore it's
[2:19:28.760 --> 2:19:32.040]  just all it's all it's like this it's sort of like if you don't watch TV in the
[2:19:32.040 --> 2:19:35.560]  afternoon for a while and then you watch TV in the afternoon you're like
[2:19:35.560 --> 2:19:42.040]  who are these poor people oh my god you know i did that yesterday
[2:19:42.040 --> 2:19:46.440]  i don't know why i don't even know what it's all like lawsuits
[2:19:46.440 --> 2:19:50.280]  and like medical devices and you can buy needles they have needles delivered
[2:19:50.280 --> 2:19:54.120]  to your house have you ever seen the tm zisha
[2:19:54.120 --> 2:19:59.880]  tm zia i swear to god this is your homework everybody listening
[2:19:59.880 --> 2:20:03.480]  everybody listening out there all of you my man you include
[2:20:03.480 --> 2:20:07.880]  that i swear to god go to your tvo and have it set don't don't
[2:20:07.880 --> 2:20:11.320]  don't subscribe just have it record one episode like tomorrow
[2:20:11.320 --> 2:20:16.600]  like the friday afternoon episode of tm z here's the show it's a half an hour
[2:20:16.600 --> 2:20:19.800]  i think it's half an hour i don't know maybe it's even more it's it's just a
[2:20:19.800 --> 2:20:25.160]  couple of guys in the camera shot and with cameras in the tm z newsroom
[2:20:25.160 --> 2:20:29.160]  uh i it's good they've got to be an la i don't know but if they're not in la it's
[2:20:29.160 --> 2:20:33.880]  i'd be shocked so they're in la they have a newsroom and they have maybe 40 or 50
[2:20:33.880 --> 2:20:38.440]  employees and they're just talking about
[2:20:38.440 --> 2:20:42.360]  the stuff that's going to be on tm z on the website
[2:20:42.360 --> 2:20:45.160]  i guess it's you know just celebrity gossip
[2:20:45.160 --> 2:20:50.200]  and then they and they just make but it's all it's mostly scandalous it's
[2:20:50.200 --> 2:20:54.760]  not like yeah carpets but also on ET this is more like scandalous stuff
[2:20:54.760 --> 2:20:59.720]  yeah and they just it's and they just sit there and make fun of people for
[2:20:59.720 --> 2:21:00.920]  first
[2:21:00.920 --> 2:21:04.600]  let me see a car add with that little creepy little general guy
[2:21:04.600 --> 2:21:07.800]  more oh and the commercials the commercials are happening the commercials
[2:21:07.800 --> 2:21:11.080]  oh yeah you know so so the content sure i mean the judge shows well that's
[2:21:11.080 --> 2:21:14.760]  but the commercials are the worst and that's what i get when i listen to the
[2:21:14.760 --> 2:21:20.200]  most radio it's it's so gross right um what was the what was the point of all
[2:21:20.200 --> 2:21:22.920]  that it's just you know like you're just describing though like yeah it seems
[2:21:22.920 --> 2:21:26.680]  like every decade everything would change and then you know and then by the 90s
[2:21:26.680 --> 2:21:29.720]  it seemed like it was really settling down into early 2000s you know it was
[2:21:29.720 --> 2:21:34.760]  amazing for me was ironically enough of course it was on one of my wackadoodle
[2:21:34.760 --> 2:21:41.400]  devices like probably the Amazon Fire TV which is easily my runaway favorite
[2:21:41.400 --> 2:21:44.920]  entertainment device right now i wanted to look to like because you know Amazon
[2:21:44.920 --> 2:21:49.320]  at some point did that thing where any seed most of the CDs you bought
[2:21:49.320 --> 2:21:53.960]  they kind of grandfathered you into an electronic copy you know about this
[2:21:53.960 --> 2:21:57.000]  yeah you don't have to buy the mp3 version if you bought the CD they had some
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:21:59.080]  kind of deal where basically if you bought the CD
[2:21:59.080 --> 2:22:02.920]  in your locker or whatever you would have all of your old files
[2:22:02.920 --> 2:22:06.840]  and i i still think that that's what they should do with ebooks
[2:22:06.840 --> 2:22:11.720]  oh god i wish i that would change everything for me if they did that i would
[2:22:11.720 --> 2:22:16.200]  it's it's either too costly or acrobatic to do ebooks right now i can do it
[2:22:16.200 --> 2:22:19.720]  and spend a lot of money or i can do it and run a lot of python but it's
[2:22:19.720 --> 2:22:25.080]  it's just it's such a pain for the experience of justified text
[2:22:25.080 --> 2:22:28.760]  but i want the paper book oh i hear you i hear you i wish they would do that well
[2:22:28.760 --> 2:22:31.800]  but anyway the the thing is i going to open that up and i'm like oh my god i
[2:22:31.800 --> 2:22:34.920]  don't remember buying like half of these albums
[2:22:34.920 --> 2:22:39.960]  and so many of the albums are from the early mid 2000s so i
[2:22:39.960 --> 2:22:46.520]  like 2002 to 2005 and you could even see at that point so many of the songs that are in my locker represent
[2:22:46.520 --> 2:22:48.920]  CDs that i bought as a court of less resort
[2:22:48.920 --> 2:22:51.960]  where like every one of these artists i can see the eye rolling that went through my
[2:22:51.960 --> 2:22:54.920]  mind where i was like okay then i can have this at a store
[2:22:54.920 --> 2:22:57.720]  yeah i'm gonna or i'm not gonna be able to download this from somewhere
[2:22:57.720 --> 2:23:01.800]  if i want this you know fairport convention album i'm gonna have to buy this
[2:23:01.800 --> 2:23:06.600]  CD and i got it i took it out i ripped it and then the CD went into a pile
[2:23:06.600 --> 2:23:10.040]  and now all those ghosts are coming back to me and it's so strange to see that
[2:23:10.040 --> 2:23:12.680]  transition i can't tell you the last time i bought a CD
[2:23:12.680 --> 2:23:16.200]  i mean do you remember the last time you bought a CD?
[2:23:16.200 --> 2:23:19.720]  no it's i don't even know where to go to get a CD at this point
[2:23:19.720 --> 2:23:24.040]  apart from mamazon i saw Amy bought one Amy bought one
[2:23:24.040 --> 2:23:29.320]  i might have been the new tom petty album but maybe she didn't even buy it though
[2:23:29.320 --> 2:23:33.240]  maybe she's in like this like a fan club so she can get like
[2:23:33.240 --> 2:23:37.400]  uh to get some stuff like that and maybe they just send it to her maybe they
[2:23:37.400 --> 2:23:40.760]  i think that maybe maybe because she's pays an annual fee to be in the fan
[2:23:40.760 --> 2:23:43.880]  club they sent her the CD i don't know that's strange though you talk about you
[2:23:43.880 --> 2:23:47.320]  know i even remember in like it really is starting especially in the mid late
[2:23:47.320 --> 2:23:50.440]  90s i guess the box sets right you're gonna really appeal to the
[2:23:50.440 --> 2:23:53.640]  collectors so the dingleings like you and me we're not only gonna have all
[2:23:53.640 --> 2:23:56.680]  these albums never gonna rebuy them because they're remaster
[2:23:56.680 --> 2:24:00.600]  and come with a booklet and they and they come to the booklet
[2:24:00.600 --> 2:24:05.160]  yeah sure special special version of track isolated vocals
[2:24:05.160 --> 2:24:08.360]  you know and some of those are heavy the beach boys will let zep one
[2:24:08.360 --> 2:24:10.840]  i'll drop it let's up on one it's pretty good huh
[2:24:10.840 --> 2:24:14.600]  let's up on one is excellent uh the police one was pretty good i remember
[2:24:14.600 --> 2:24:17.960]  the police sounded like homemade shit when they when the CDs first came out
[2:24:17.960 --> 2:24:22.040]  i remember in particular they really what very first hearing like out
[2:24:22.040 --> 2:24:25.480]  landos to more it sounded like somebody was running some kind of
[2:24:25.480 --> 2:24:35.240]  air pressure gun background but but uh but now i mean it's suddenly i feel
[2:24:35.240 --> 2:24:38.600]  like riven wiggle i woke up and even even i am different now
[2:24:38.600 --> 2:24:41.800]  like you well on the mailing point being that like there was a time when like
[2:24:41.800 --> 2:24:44.600]  you could fancy yourself a collector you receive the collector and you
[2:24:44.600 --> 2:24:48.520]  collected them and you put them on the shelves in a certain order and you
[2:24:48.520 --> 2:24:52.120]  you know make them look pretty and for me the last gas but that has been like like
[2:24:52.120 --> 2:24:57.080]  i say this is app i use so music brains with the z dot org is a really good
[2:24:57.080 --> 2:25:00.280]  site for finding metadata they've got metadata on pretty much any
[2:25:00.280 --> 2:25:03.000]  audio you can ever want it's like the basics you know there's
[2:25:03.000 --> 2:25:05.400]  you've got these for different kinds of media that's the one to go to
[2:25:05.400 --> 2:25:09.480]  for music stuff and they have an app called Picard um this kind of janky but
[2:25:09.480 --> 2:25:12.920]  cool app where you can drop a bunch of mp3s on and you pick which album
[2:25:12.920 --> 2:25:16.280]  version that is and it's super smart about getting your metadata right
[2:25:16.280 --> 2:25:20.120]  and i feel like in my head that right there me getting a record that i got
[2:25:20.120 --> 2:25:22.440]  somewhere and dropping it into Picard is the last
[2:25:22.440 --> 2:25:27.080]  gasp of me as a music owning collector me sweating the metadata on that
[2:25:27.080 --> 2:25:29.240]  because at this point i'm sitting there and i'm going okay
[2:25:29.240 --> 2:25:33.240]  matched uploaded you know rejected like i don't even care anymore
[2:25:33.240 --> 2:25:36.200]  like i signed it for beats music and now most of it is there
[2:25:36.200 --> 2:25:39.800]  and all of a sudden all of these files are like virtually meaningless and i
[2:25:39.800 --> 2:25:43.880]  haven't missed it it totally as somebody who has been obsessed with music for
[2:25:43.880 --> 2:25:48.120]  40 years i can't believe how much i think i could live without almost all of
[2:25:48.120 --> 2:25:53.480]  that stuff and it's really weird yeah it's i'm exactly there with you
[2:25:53.480 --> 2:25:56.680]  where it's i used to have it you know i didn't i didn't buy a
[2:25:56.680 --> 2:26:00.280]  compared to most of my friends probably probably bought fewer CDs than many of
[2:26:00.280 --> 2:26:04.520]  them but i certainly had a lot i remember you know in college thinking
[2:26:04.520 --> 2:26:09.160]  and it was absolutely positively no hyperbole that most of my
[2:26:09.160 --> 2:26:13.400]  liquid net worth was tied up in CDs CDs and because i mean
[2:26:13.400 --> 2:26:18.040]  first thing i when i meet somebody go to their dorm room or later apartment
[2:26:18.040 --> 2:26:21.800]  very first thing i do was look at their books and look at their CDs
[2:26:21.800 --> 2:26:24.360]  and see like how much i could learn about them from looking at
[2:26:24.360 --> 2:26:27.240]  like how they organize their CDs did they organize their CDs what books did
[2:26:27.240 --> 2:26:29.720]  they have did they have which ones were obviously
[2:26:29.720 --> 2:26:32.600]  much red and which ones were untouched
[2:26:32.600 --> 2:26:36.120]  books didn't have the resell value though that CDs did because you could
[2:26:36.120 --> 2:26:39.560]  what you could do for CDs when you were strapped for cash is sell a couple you
[2:26:39.560 --> 2:26:42.360]  know you'd find a couple that you haven't listened to for a while and you'd
[2:26:42.360 --> 2:26:46.600]  get you know six seven bucks form you know and then they you could buy the
[2:26:46.600 --> 2:26:50.120]  used ones for like nine ninety nine you know there was in a little bit of
[2:26:50.120 --> 2:26:53.560]  arbitrage in there but you could you could take four or five
[2:26:53.560 --> 2:26:57.800]  CDs into the CDs store and then come out with yeah absolutely
[2:26:57.800 --> 2:27:01.240]  but but you know it wasn't more than a few years ago
[2:27:01.240 --> 2:27:05.080]  that i remember hearing like it seemed revolutionary even in maybe my child's
[2:27:05.080 --> 2:27:08.360]  lifetime it seemed revolutionary to me that there was a service
[2:27:08.360 --> 2:27:13.640]  where you could mail or drop off all of your CDs
[2:27:13.640 --> 2:27:16.520]  and now get ready for this because what they're going to do is they're going to
[2:27:16.520 --> 2:27:20.600]  rip all of those at high quality get the right metadata on them
[2:27:20.600 --> 2:27:23.560]  and then send them back to you on a hard drive
[2:27:23.560 --> 2:27:26.760]  like i swear to Christ it seems like about five years ago that's still
[2:27:26.760 --> 2:27:30.040]  seemed amazingly innovative and now that seems like the craziest
[2:27:30.040 --> 2:27:33.480]  rubleberg machine i've ever heard in my life it would be like
[2:27:33.480 --> 2:27:38.840]  appetizing my recycling like why would i do that today
[2:27:38.840 --> 2:27:42.360]  i don't know speaking about podcast and the length of podcast
[2:27:42.360 --> 2:27:47.880]  i have one more sponsor to thank our fourth and final sponsor
[2:27:47.880 --> 2:27:51.640]  brand new up and comers uh i believe it's the first time they've sponsored
[2:27:51.640 --> 2:27:56.520]  podcast it's a company called square space was that a startup John
[2:27:56.520 --> 2:28:01.160]  that is a startup where they based i guess i think silicon valley John
[2:28:01.160 --> 2:28:07.080]  uh i think that they're on the internet um square space
[2:28:07.080 --> 2:28:12.920]  is an all-in-one way that create edit design modify
[2:28:12.920 --> 2:28:16.040]  your own website now you guys know they're not new they're old
[2:28:16.040 --> 2:28:20.040]  they've been here for a while they're the probably pre-eminent podcast sponsor
[2:28:20.040 --> 2:28:25.000]  out there um but the fact is i've spoken to them
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:29.560]  people keep signing up people keep needing you know it's like a funny thing
[2:28:29.560 --> 2:28:32.920]  because people you know you make a website you know i have daring fireball it
[2:28:32.920 --> 2:28:36.200]  keeps you know it's just the same thing but people keep coming up with new
[2:28:36.200 --> 2:28:40.280]  ideas for websites and more and more and more a lot of people are going to
[2:28:40.280 --> 2:28:45.960]  square space first to set them up um because it really is an incredibly
[2:28:45.960 --> 2:28:52.120]  adaptive platform for creating in very very different types of sites
[2:28:52.120 --> 2:28:55.800]  blogs podcasts awful a lot of podcasts are hosted from square space
[2:28:55.800 --> 2:28:59.640]  mine is um uh it's a great it's we just you should go
[2:28:59.640 --> 2:29:03.800]  you create a post you attach a piece of media and now you've officially become
[2:29:03.800 --> 2:29:08.040]  a podcaster it's that simple right and all the crazy stuff like getting an
[2:29:08.040 --> 2:29:11.480]  RSS feed that iTunes is going to be satisfied with it's it all just pops
[2:29:11.480 --> 2:29:13.800]  out the other end but if you're a photographer
[2:29:13.800 --> 2:29:18.200]  or and you want to set up a gallery site uh or a huge thing
[2:29:18.200 --> 2:29:22.360]  big and growing is their commerce features where you can set up a shop
[2:29:22.360 --> 2:29:26.920]  for anything whether you're selling t-shirts or here's like an example
[2:29:26.920 --> 2:29:31.400]  in right here on their site where they show it um a company that makes neck ties
[2:29:31.400 --> 2:29:36.120]  for gentlemen uh just go there if you haven't done it just go there and just
[2:29:36.120 --> 2:29:39.880]  look at their like gallery of example sites of things built with square
[2:29:39.880 --> 2:29:42.600]  space and you almost can't believe that they're all built
[2:29:42.600 --> 2:29:45.880]  using the same platform because each one is so unique
[2:29:45.880 --> 2:29:49.960]  and different and original and fitting for what the purpose is whether it's
[2:29:49.960 --> 2:29:54.600]  like uh a graphic designer who's setting up a gallery of their work
[2:29:54.600 --> 2:30:01.000]  or somebody who is selling uh custom high-end coffee makers or something like that
[2:30:01.000 --> 2:30:06.760]  all of it now they brand new version seven of their platform uh better than ever
[2:30:06.760 --> 2:30:09.960]  they have all sorts of information on the site i can't even get into how
[2:30:09.960 --> 2:30:15.480]  many ways that it's better um but just really really cool company
[2:30:15.480 --> 2:30:20.360]  really great and it's just if you have an idea for a website of any kind your
[2:30:20.360 --> 2:30:25.480]  own podcast selling stuff but starting a blog uh can't recommend highly
[2:30:25.480 --> 2:30:28.680]  enough that you go there because you're going to save so much time
[2:30:28.680 --> 2:30:33.480]  setting it up and it's really really great and they have award-winning
[2:30:33.480 --> 2:30:37.240]  technical support that's i probably fundamental even better
[2:30:37.240 --> 2:30:40.200]  more than the design of their platform itself it's the tech support that i
[2:30:40.200 --> 2:30:43.160]  think probably keeps them as successful as they are because it's the hardest
[2:30:43.160 --> 2:30:48.280]  thing to get right uh 24-7 customer support they've
[2:30:48.280 --> 2:30:51.400]  got people in New York uh i think it's double in somewhere in
[2:30:51.400 --> 2:30:56.360]  Europe and uh now portland organ so that more or less covers the globe maybe
[2:30:56.360 --> 2:31:00.360]  maybe if you're Ben Thompson and you live in Taipei maybe
[2:31:00.360 --> 2:31:05.080]  you know it's he lives in Taipei yeah
[2:31:05.080 --> 2:31:08.680]  he's over in Taipei oh i think it's like a type-aid personality
[2:31:08.680 --> 2:31:14.200]  oh no no he's in Taiwan um it's funny it's always it's always funny trying
[2:31:14.200 --> 2:31:17.480]  to schedule a time to record a show with him because that's again talking
[2:31:17.480 --> 2:31:21.560]  uh time zones we need to record with Ben Thompson he's he's like in
[2:31:21.560 --> 2:31:29.720]  tomorrow i love how gross out your um where do you go to find out more for

[2:32:06.520 --> 2:32:10.600]  square space is probably for you and you don't realize it yet
[2:32:10.600 --> 2:32:13.480]  but i can almost promise you if it's not for you
[2:32:13.480 --> 2:32:17.160]  i pretty much can promise it's for somebody you know so even if you are like a
[2:32:17.160 --> 2:32:21.000]  total code slinging daring fire a bald nut job just remember there's
[2:32:21.000 --> 2:32:23.880]  somebody in your life who's not that great at that and does not want to have
[2:32:23.880 --> 2:32:27.080]  to go restart my sequel or something and like that's that might be who
[2:32:27.080 --> 2:32:29.640]  square space is for in your life and if you've ever had to sit there and
[2:32:29.640 --> 2:32:32.920]  babysit a site that you've set up for somebody like this is going to be the
[2:32:32.920 --> 2:32:36.280]  answer to your prayers it is so great yeah and so fast to set people up so
[2:32:36.280 --> 2:32:39.720]  even if it's not exactly for you the listener please keep in mind it could be
[2:32:39.720 --> 2:32:43.160]  perfect for somebody that you know she heard the testimonial that uh
[2:32:43.160 --> 2:32:46.920]  Marco had a couple weeks ago on ATP where he was talking about it
[2:32:46.920 --> 2:32:51.880]  he you know somehow involved with the pre-school for their son you know
[2:32:51.880 --> 2:32:55.400]  like a petite that equivalent of pta and that the school was going to have a
[2:32:55.400 --> 2:32:59.000]  fundraiser and i wanted to set up a new website like
[2:32:59.000 --> 2:33:03.080]  um for this thing with the kid's school and they had like a budget of like
[2:33:03.080 --> 2:33:06.200]  four or five thousand dollars or something which is a lot of money for like a
[2:33:06.200 --> 2:33:11.080]  you know donation run p2 and and Marco of course being Marco at me i sort of
[2:33:11.080 --> 2:33:14.200]  rolled my eyes Marco stuff and he was like you guys and nuts you guys should just
[2:33:14.200 --> 2:33:18.600]  i'd hear give me a day and he like went and set up a square space for the pta
[2:33:18.600 --> 2:33:22.840]  and you know it was like ten bucks a month and set it up and came back and
[2:33:22.840 --> 2:33:25.480]  like the next week's meeting it was like here here here's the thing
[2:33:25.480 --> 2:33:28.440]  and it's everything that you guys were budgeting five thousand dollars for
[2:33:28.440 --> 2:33:32.600]  now it's ten dollars a month and it just runs it's really true yeah and
[2:33:32.600 --> 2:33:36.280]  and like what he said is that he did it he did invest a little bit of time to get
[2:33:36.280 --> 2:33:39.400]  it up and running and pick a template and get the things set up and configure it
[2:33:39.400 --> 2:33:42.680]  but now it just and you don't have to write documentation you don't have to
[2:33:42.680 --> 2:33:45.400]  write five pages we went through this with my kids preschool
[2:33:45.400 --> 2:33:48.280]  where like i've always been like look you don't need to know what i do for
[2:33:48.280 --> 2:33:50.840]  living you don't need to know i'm on twitter you need to know
[2:33:50.840 --> 2:33:54.760]  go put me over here to pull weeds and pick up cat poop with headphones on and i
[2:33:54.760 --> 2:33:57.560]  will be happy please do not put me on the it committee
[2:33:57.560 --> 2:34:00.040]  somehow i ended up getting involved with the website
[2:34:00.040 --> 2:34:05.480]  and they had so much sunk cost in this really really stupid website that nobody
[2:34:05.480 --> 2:34:07.480]  ever used and nobody knew how to update
[2:34:07.480 --> 2:34:10.680]  they were so basically my job became like track down the person who knows the
[2:34:10.680 --> 2:34:13.880]  password find the person who knows the password get it up privileges that we
[2:34:13.880 --> 2:34:17.640]  can SSH in and like it's you're like look here's the thing
[2:34:17.640 --> 2:34:22.680]  have somebody spend one hour literally copying and pasting text from the pages
[2:34:22.680 --> 2:34:26.440]  that are up send that to me and i will have a website for you by tonight
[2:34:26.440 --> 2:34:29.160]  and then we'll never speak of it again
[2:34:29.160 --> 2:34:33.160]  and it's like it's a game changer right i honestly i think you're exactly
[2:34:33.160 --> 2:34:36.680]  right that that's the key at that the thing to take away with square space is
[2:34:36.680 --> 2:34:39.560]  even if you don't have a need right now file them away in your back pocket
[2:34:39.560 --> 2:34:43.720]  for when you need to set up a website for someone and then you don't want to
[2:34:43.720 --> 2:34:45.240]  you don't want it like you said you don't want to have to
[2:34:45.240 --> 2:34:48.200]  that's the back channel secret of square space it's for people
[2:34:48.200 --> 2:34:51.240]  who maybe in some cases could make a site not that well not stand up that
[2:34:51.240 --> 2:34:53.080]  well but they certainly do not want to have to be
[2:34:53.080 --> 2:34:56.040]  maintaining their church's website and perpetuity
[2:34:56.040 --> 2:35:00.680]  right well we did it we went over to one over two and a half bucks here
[2:35:00.680 --> 2:35:05.320]  two thirty five buddy people like it i don't if i guess i mean it
[2:35:05.320 --> 2:35:08.680]  sincerely go to you know right right to me at the daring fireball email
[2:35:08.680 --> 2:35:10.040]  thing
[2:35:10.040 --> 2:35:13.080]  you know there's a link on the website and let me if you really hate these
[2:35:13.080 --> 2:35:16.120]  long episodes let me know because nobody else is saying that people are
[2:35:16.120 --> 2:35:20.200]  saying they really dig it you know i think of it as
[2:35:20.200 --> 2:35:24.360]  you know i'd like i said i do i seems like i do about 40 episodes a year
[2:35:24.360 --> 2:35:28.680]  but they've gotten longer so it's i am podcast because of the time change
[2:35:28.680 --> 2:35:31.080]  some of them probably 24 hours wrapped around the international
[2:35:31.080 --> 2:35:33.720]  date line there's probably some of your episodes that are that are still
[2:35:33.720 --> 2:35:36.920]  playing somewhere like all the time
[2:35:36.920 --> 2:35:40.360]  i'm up to be it the funniest moment on this whole
[2:35:40.360 --> 2:35:44.760]  recording was that that sad sound you made when i said that when you talk to
[2:35:44.760 --> 2:35:46.680]  Ben Thompson he's in the bar
[2:35:46.680 --> 2:35:51.320]  we're so grossed out it's you know i've i spent a lot of years trying to figure
[2:35:51.320 --> 2:35:55.400]  out a lot of things john and there are some little bits of crud it's still
[2:35:55.400 --> 2:35:58.680]  just get stuck in the machine and when i try to measure people who are living
[2:35:58.680 --> 2:36:02.040]  on a different day it just makes me fucking angry
[2:36:02.040 --> 2:36:07.320]  i hate is like i don't understand it i don't understand that i've been oh i mean
[2:36:07.320 --> 2:36:11.000]  it's like when you find out that the dinner is going to be like uh you know
[2:36:11.000 --> 2:36:15.080]  like when did the the whole the actual pigs had
[2:36:15.080 --> 2:36:19.960]  it's a delicacy right and you're just not prepared for that level no no
[2:36:19.960 --> 2:36:22.760]  it's like somebody hands you oh you think i have a sprite
[2:36:22.760 --> 2:36:26.280]  or you say like you say like uh can i have uh like a coke and they hand you a
[2:36:26.280 --> 2:36:29.080]  diet doctor pepper you know like what the fuck is this yeah
[2:36:29.080 --> 2:36:33.000]  uh that's not what i signed up for
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:36.760]  i think we helped a lot of people today i had to we always help people i do
[2:36:36.760 --> 2:36:39.880]  think that that's it's when you and i get together it's a public service
[2:36:39.880 --> 2:36:42.360]  just can we get a final update on internet internet how are things going
[2:36:42.360 --> 2:36:46.360]  do they fix the cones everything good they i still didn't get a text from
[2:36:46.360 --> 2:36:49.480]  them but um my other machine here is on the wi-fi and it
[2:36:49.480 --> 2:36:53.240]  it is seems to be running nice
[2:36:53.240 --> 2:36:59.320]  we waited them out oh man i don't know if the dog i don't know if they've ever
[2:36:59.320 --> 2:37:04.200]  caught the cat never caught the cat well thanks for having me
[2:37:04.200 --> 2:37:08.120]  oh it's always a pleasure it's been too long it has been too long i'm i'm it's
[2:37:08.120 --> 2:37:10.920]  uh it's always a lot of fun to do i really enjoy your show
[2:37:10.920 --> 2:37:15.320]  and uh it's always great to be here do you think there's a branding angle on
[2:37:15.320 --> 2:37:18.840]  the dogs and cats like maybe they've got like a maybe they have like a
[2:37:18.840 --> 2:37:24.200]  commercial that involves a dog cheat you know it it's too random
[2:37:24.200 --> 2:37:28.840]  oh i i got one thought um they needed something to be in motion
[2:37:28.840 --> 2:37:33.240]  it was so clearly composited from stock art so let's just when people get i
[2:37:33.240 --> 2:37:35.400]  want you guys to really take some time to go look at this and i want you to
[2:37:35.400 --> 2:37:38.680]  realize that he's on a ladder behind an orange cone to
[2:37:38.680 --> 2:37:42.280]  nowhere he's going to know where they needed some dynamism in it
[2:37:42.280 --> 2:37:45.560]  so what you could get a horse galloping you could have a dog chase a cat maybe
[2:37:45.560 --> 2:37:48.920]  you could have something falling from a roof like a satellite dish
[2:37:48.920 --> 2:37:54.680]  ooh burn like i don't know i think the dog in the cat are there for dynamism
[2:37:54.680 --> 2:37:58.920]  i guess so that's part of you as far as the expert in any experience
[2:37:58.920 --> 2:38:01.720]  i really hope i hope that whoever made that graphic
[2:38:01.720 --> 2:38:05.480]  that somebody you know work probably right here in philadelphia uh
[2:38:05.480 --> 2:38:09.480]  working in the comcast tower you know with a graphic design job and then

[2:38:13.080 --> 2:38:16.520]  show and knows just how much joy they brought into our life
[2:38:16.520 --> 2:38:19.640]  making a graphic that maybe while they were making it was a bit of a
[2:38:19.640 --> 2:38:23.320]  drudgery yeah because i got to tell you it really made my day me too man i
[2:38:23.320 --> 2:38:26.760]  just that the dropshadow by the cone was really really
[2:38:26.760 --> 2:38:30.920]  absorbing for me if i can get over the idea of where that guy lives in china
[2:38:30.920 --> 2:38:35.400]  that may be think about that when i'm sleeping the night
