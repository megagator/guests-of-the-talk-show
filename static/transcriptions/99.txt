[00:00.000 --> 00:01.000]  Hello.
[00:01.000 --> 00:02.000]  Hello.
[00:02.000 --> 00:03.000]  How are you?
[00:03.000 --> 00:04.000]  I'm good.
[00:04.000 --> 00:06.000]  How are you?
[00:06.000 --> 00:07.000]  You sound all right.
[00:07.000 --> 00:08.000]  How do I sound?
[00:08.000 --> 00:10.760]  You sound surprisingly good.
[00:10.760 --> 00:12.120]  Is this LTE?
[00:12.120 --> 00:13.120]  This is LTE.
[00:13.120 --> 00:14.120]  You're kidding.
[00:14.120 --> 00:15.120]  No.
[00:15.120 --> 00:16.120]  Oh, man.
[00:16.120 --> 00:17.120]  Verizon.
[00:17.120 --> 00:20.960]  Good old Verizon.
[00:20.960 --> 00:23.240]  So the back story is that we've…
[00:23.240 --> 00:26.400]  Stop looking at this picture.
[00:26.400 --> 00:32.560]  We were supposed to record 36 minutes ago and I was going to be ready when all of a sudden
[00:32.560 --> 00:38.000]  my home internet went out and just like a hard stop, like nothing loaded.
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.720]  And then I started getting activation paid, like what you would get if you had…
[00:43.720 --> 00:45.720]  When you don't pay your bill.
[00:45.720 --> 00:46.720]  No.
[00:46.720 --> 00:51.200]  More like if you have a brand new, like brand new stuff, like you just moved into cable
[00:51.200 --> 00:52.200]  town.
[00:52.200 --> 00:56.000]  Like you just moved here, you got your Comcast box, this is what you see.
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.520]  But like actually trying to do the activation doesn't do anything.
[01:00.520 --> 01:01.760]  And so you had the good idea.
[01:01.760 --> 01:06.840]  We were texting and you told me to use my phone, go to the Comcast site and see if they
[01:06.840 --> 01:10.840]  tell you that there's an outage.
[01:10.840 --> 01:11.840]  And it worked.
[01:11.840 --> 01:18.200]  I logged into my Comcast account and it gave me a message here that says, hello, John.
[01:18.200 --> 01:19.200]  All caps.
[01:19.200 --> 01:21.420]  John is in all caps.
[01:21.420 --> 01:23.520]  An outage has been reported in your area.
[01:23.520 --> 01:26.680]  We expect this to be resolved by today.
[01:26.680 --> 01:31.960]  And then you can describe, I sent this to you, we'll include this image in the show
[01:31.960 --> 01:33.520]  notes or somehow in the art.
[01:33.520 --> 01:35.840]  So everybody, all of you deserve to enjoy this.
[01:35.840 --> 01:40.280]  But Merlin, for the historical record, can you describe this image?
[01:40.280 --> 01:41.280]  Sure.
[01:41.280 --> 01:42.280]  Sure.
[01:42.280 --> 01:47.580]  I think it's clearly, it comes from the same grand tradition as the blinking under
[01:47.580 --> 01:50.960]  construction GIF from back in the day.
[01:50.960 --> 01:57.440]  I guess the primary feature is a big white van that says Xfinity on it, right?
[01:57.440 --> 01:58.440]  Close enough, right?
[01:58.440 --> 01:59.600]  This is going to be a repair guy.
[01:59.600 --> 02:04.920]  And then a picture of a stock art guy in a red and black check shirt with a hard hat
[02:04.920 --> 02:08.040]  climbing a yellow ladder, right?
[02:08.040 --> 02:09.640]  So far so good.
[02:09.640 --> 02:13.360]  It's an image to show you that we expect this to be resolved by today.
[02:13.360 --> 02:18.760]  It gets interesting though, because the ladder is situated with a very strange, incorrect
[02:18.760 --> 02:19.760]  drop shadow.
[02:19.760 --> 02:26.840]  So basically it appears to be about to fix an 11 foot high orange safety cone.
[02:26.840 --> 02:28.640]  It's a lot higher than 11 feet, I think.
[02:28.640 --> 02:32.200]  I think it's about a 15 foot safety cone.
[02:32.200 --> 02:35.200]  There's one orange construction cone on the right side of the page that's upright.
[02:35.200 --> 02:36.320]  That's at least 10 feet high.
[02:36.320 --> 02:40.480]  And another one, another safety cone next to it that's fallen over.
[02:40.480 --> 02:45.400]  And this guy on a ladder is, he's on a ladder and he's behind the cone.
[02:45.400 --> 02:48.400]  He's probably about five feet behind the cone climbing a ladder.
[02:48.400 --> 02:55.520]  Oh, and did I mention there's also a dog chasing a cat in the foreground and then the really
[02:55.520 --> 02:59.600]  subtle part is in the upper right hand corner for reasons I'm not entirely sure of, there's
[02:59.600 --> 03:03.320]  a bird flying by.
[03:03.320 --> 03:07.120]  You do, you really have to see it to appreciate, but he looks, he looks like he's there to
[03:07.120 --> 03:08.840]  fix the safety cone.
[03:08.840 --> 03:12.880]  And uh, anyway, they're working on that.
[03:12.880 --> 03:27.880]  Why, why, why is there, he took the time to put a drop shadow on everything, but they
[03:27.880 --> 03:29.600]  aren't right.
[03:29.600 --> 03:34.620]  The drop shadow on the ladder has no relationship with the cone that he's theoretically fixing.
[03:34.620 --> 03:36.480]  It's just the drop shadow stops.
[03:36.480 --> 03:41.120]  It's almost as though we're seeing the cone drop from the sky just right next to where
[03:41.120 --> 03:49.220]  he happens to be climbing a ladder to nothing.
[03:49.220 --> 03:50.720]  So you pivoted.
[03:50.720 --> 03:51.720]  So I pivoted.
[03:51.720 --> 03:52.720]  Now we're doing it over LT.
[03:52.720 --> 03:53.720]  Yeah.
[03:53.720 --> 03:57.720]  Like I should probably close this, but I kind of feel like I can't, I told you, I'll tell
[03:57.720 --> 03:59.880]  I told you when we're texting, this is nothing against cable town.
[03:59.880 --> 04:04.520]  They're a great company, but I swear to Christ, every time I see or hear that word Xfinity,
[04:04.520 --> 04:07.720]  I just, it makes me see, and I can't even tell you why.
[04:07.720 --> 04:13.160]  I mean, in the same way that like Farfik Nugent in the late eighties was funny.
[04:13.160 --> 04:18.700]  Like Xfinity is offensive to me because that's their whole, their whole branded line of something
[04:18.700 --> 04:21.880]  involving a cable lifestyle in your home.
[04:21.880 --> 04:22.880]  Is that right?
[04:22.880 --> 04:24.760]  Or, or business.
[04:24.760 --> 04:28.240]  I think that's what they would tell you that that's probably, probably the exact words
[04:28.240 --> 04:35.660]  that they used, um, um, that when they came up with the idea that they would stop caught
[04:35.660 --> 04:40.400]  just calling themselves Comcast and that, you know, that they would, that Comcast would
[04:40.400 --> 04:46.400]  be some kind of parent brand for all of their various endeavors and now like their Comcast
[04:46.400 --> 04:47.400]  logo.
[04:47.400 --> 04:52.600]  Now they've, they've taken the NBC peacock, it's, you know, part of their, like they're
[04:52.600 --> 04:53.600]  a content company.
[04:53.600 --> 04:56.820]  Now they have a, they have NBC, they have universal.
[04:56.820 --> 05:01.240]  And so like the, the cable business is, is now Xfinity.
[05:01.240 --> 05:06.160]  And I believe that what those words you just use is probably how they, they, they probably
[05:06.160 --> 05:07.160]  pitched it.
[05:07.160 --> 05:10.120]  They would use the phrase SMB probably for small business.
[05:10.120 --> 05:12.680]  Do they still use that and you still hear SMB?
[05:12.680 --> 05:13.680]  Uh, nope.
[05:13.680 --> 05:14.680]  Yeah.
[05:14.680 --> 05:15.680]  Yeah.
[05:15.680 --> 05:18.880]  I mean, I think it's, it's, you know, it's funny cause you think about, think about like
[05:18.880 --> 05:23.220]  when Dropbox came along and one of the gosh, half dozen things that was so mind blowing
[05:23.220 --> 05:27.880]  about Dropbox is they were doing something that had been very difficult for any number
[05:27.880 --> 05:33.540]  of reasons to do before, not least because being a commodity or being a utility is not
[05:33.540 --> 05:40.720]  interesting and it's not sexy and having dependable, you know, file syncing in that case was, was
[05:40.720 --> 05:44.320]  an unsolved problem that was not on the face of it that profitable, right?
[05:44.320 --> 05:46.920]  So there's so many things that, you know, setting aside the fact that the sync actually
[05:46.920 --> 05:50.520]  worked, which was mind blowing, but I mean you think about it, you're a cable company
[05:50.520 --> 05:53.280]  and I'm sure you've seen that graph that's gone around about how the cable companies
[05:53.280 --> 05:54.960]  have like come together over the years.
[05:54.960 --> 05:58.240]  You know, like in the eighties there was like 30 different cable providers and now there's
[05:58.240 --> 05:59.960]  like four or whatever.
[05:59.960 --> 06:00.960]  Yeah.
[06:00.960 --> 06:05.120]  So I imagine their thinking was like, we've got to have some kind of a way to brand the
[06:05.120 --> 06:10.960]  notion of this coaxial cable coming into your house that's going to give you a suite of
[06:10.960 --> 06:11.960]  services, right?
[06:11.960 --> 06:13.960]  You got your internet connection, you got your TV, what else?
[06:13.960 --> 06:16.340]  Oh, well they got that like the home monitoring, right?
[06:16.340 --> 06:17.340]  You can get like security.
[06:17.340 --> 06:19.560]  Isn't that part of the Xfinity package?
[06:19.560 --> 06:20.560]  I believe it is now.
[06:20.560 --> 06:21.560]  Xfinity lifestyle.
[06:21.560 --> 06:22.560]  Right.
[06:22.560 --> 06:23.560]  Yeah.
[06:23.560 --> 06:28.160]  So if you have a cable where you watch sports, no, this is an entire lifestyle of Xfinity.
[06:28.160 --> 06:30.680]  Your landline telephone service.
[06:30.680 --> 06:31.680]  Yeah.
[06:31.680 --> 06:34.960]  And they really want you to get that whole package, boy.
[06:34.960 --> 06:38.360]  You call them up for anything and boy, they really want to, what is it going to take to
[06:38.360 --> 06:42.720]  put you into a phone today?
[06:42.720 --> 06:43.720]  I have it.
[06:43.720 --> 06:45.220]  I have the thing.
[06:45.220 --> 06:50.680]  We don't have a single landline phone that's actually hooked up to a phone jack in the
[06:50.680 --> 06:55.480]  house so we have a phone number and it never rings.
[06:55.480 --> 06:56.480]  But it costs.
[06:56.480 --> 06:57.480]  Really?
[06:57.480 --> 07:01.080]  I think it costs less than if we just had internet.
[07:01.080 --> 07:02.080]  I don't know.
[07:02.080 --> 07:03.080]  That's so weird.
[07:03.080 --> 07:06.840]  I'm overdue to call them and to go through the pantomime.
[07:06.840 --> 07:12.480]  I'm years overdue of the, like I'm sure Syracuse probably does this, like he has a reminder
[07:12.480 --> 07:14.000]  once a year because you really need to.
[07:14.000 --> 07:18.600]  You call them up and say, I'm going to cancel my service and then they say, oh God, no.
[07:18.600 --> 07:22.680]  And then they cut you a deal and give you faster service at a lower price like you're
[07:22.680 --> 07:23.680]  a new customer.
[07:23.680 --> 07:27.600]  Because if you're like me and you're a dummy and you signed up a couple years ago and you
[07:27.600 --> 07:33.320]  just let it go, your promotional rate ended at some point and now I pay, I don't know,
[07:33.320 --> 07:37.400]  $200 a month for something I could probably pay a lot less for.
[07:37.400 --> 07:38.400]  Right.
[07:38.400 --> 07:39.400]  That happened to me with AT&T.
[07:39.400 --> 07:45.840]  I need to carefully look at this month's bill but I called them up to, I think I was calling
[07:45.840 --> 07:47.160]  partly because there's a weird charge.
[07:47.160 --> 07:49.720]  I guess I was also just asking about iPhone update availability.
[07:49.720 --> 07:54.160]  Anyway, I ended up calling them and you know, the drill where they like want to talk to
[07:54.160 --> 07:56.000]  you about the special offers and stuff like that.
[07:56.000 --> 07:58.080]  No, that's why I don't do it.
[07:58.080 --> 07:59.080]  No, no, it's the worst.
[07:59.080 --> 08:04.200]  But I have to say, you know, actually AT&T, in my experience, I don't love that service
[08:04.200 --> 08:05.200]  or company.
[08:05.200 --> 08:08.240]  I mean, I really don't, but the people that you end up talking to are pretty great at
[08:08.240 --> 08:09.240]  AT&T sometimes.
[08:09.240 --> 08:13.280]  But long story short, this, this woman was like, well, you know, we were like, you can
[08:13.280 --> 08:14.280]  really bring your bill down.
[08:14.280 --> 08:15.480]  I was like, tell me about it.
[08:15.480 --> 08:18.120]  What do I have to do to bring my bill down?
[08:18.120 --> 08:20.720]  And she's like, well, we can just change it to this family data package and diddly diddly
[08:20.720 --> 08:21.720]  diddly.
[08:21.720 --> 08:23.200]  And now my phone bill dropped by like a hundred dollars.
[08:23.200 --> 08:29.720]  Yeah, I know exactly what you mean now, but I'm, of course, I'm naturally very, you know,
[08:29.720 --> 08:32.880]  very skeptical because you figure, I was like, and so of course now I'm looking for a catch
[08:32.880 --> 08:33.880]  guy.
[08:33.880 --> 08:34.880]  I'm like, Oh, what does it mean?
[08:34.880 --> 08:36.000]  We're re upping for like another five years.
[08:36.000 --> 08:37.580]  We got to get a Samsung tablet.
[08:37.580 --> 08:38.580]  Like what is it?
[08:38.580 --> 08:42.440]  What, what's the downside of this doesn't just, you just pay less money.
[08:42.440 --> 08:44.440]  That's something you'd want to do.
[08:44.440 --> 08:49.840]  It's like, all right, Stockholm syndrome, you know, I'm just like, she's being so nice
[08:49.840 --> 08:53.720]  to me and I feel like, you know, I don't want to, I, you know, whenever I talk to a customer
[08:53.720 --> 08:55.200]  service person, I'm terrified.
[08:55.200 --> 08:58.040]  I really don't want to incur their wrath cause I don't know.
[08:58.040 --> 09:02.400]  There's a few ways they can help you and about a million ways they could screw you up.
[09:02.400 --> 09:03.400]  All right.
[09:03.400 --> 09:04.400]  Or yeah, make things worse.
[09:04.400 --> 09:05.400]  Yeah.
[09:05.400 --> 09:09.000]  Like all of a sudden you're, you know, you're signed up for a $300 a month international
[09:09.000 --> 09:10.000]  data plan.
[09:10.000 --> 09:11.000]  Yeah.
[09:11.000 --> 09:18.720]  Like the platinum overnight web package and they go daddy, you always feel used to feel
[09:18.720 --> 09:21.600]  sometimes they've gotten better at this over the years, but with go daddy, I used to feel
[09:21.600 --> 09:25.480]  like I was running down a hallway while a dozen frat boys were trying to hit me with
[09:25.480 --> 09:26.720]  a sock full of pennies.
[09:26.720 --> 09:30.480]  Like can I just, no, I don't need anything tonight.
[09:30.480 --> 09:31.480]  I don't need anything overnight.
[09:31.480 --> 09:32.480]  I don't even platinum.
[09:32.480 --> 09:35.320]  I just want this domain.
[09:35.320 --> 09:40.000]  I don't think that, I don't think Comcast knows what to do with their money.
[09:40.000 --> 09:41.000]  I really don't.
[09:41.000 --> 09:42.760]  I mean, they've spent a ton of it here.
[09:42.760 --> 09:45.920]  I mean, it's, you know, this is cable town and I've said this before on the show where
[09:45.920 --> 09:50.480]  they've built the tallest skyscraper in Philadelphia.
[09:50.480 --> 09:56.760]  And now they're building another one, like one block over that's going to be even bigger.
[09:56.760 --> 10:02.000]  And nobody really knows why, you know, it's that they've just got more money than they
[10:02.000 --> 10:03.000]  know what to do with.
[10:03.000 --> 10:04.000]  Yeah.
[10:04.000 --> 10:05.000]  Yeah.
[10:05.000 --> 10:09.600]  I hadn't thought about this in this way too much, but sometimes it seems like you've got
[10:09.600 --> 10:13.680]  in the case of these or like, especially like legacy carriers from back in the day, you've
[10:13.680 --> 10:18.080]  got, well, there's the stuff we made money with in the past, like a million years ago,
[10:18.080 --> 10:23.780]  there's an infrastructure that we built, like all the investments we made over the years.
[10:23.780 --> 10:29.600]  And then there's this rapidly evolving market for what people actually want.
[10:29.600 --> 10:34.200]  And all of that stuff that we see as being very valuable just simply does not register
[10:34.200 --> 10:35.200]  for most people.
[10:35.200 --> 10:40.360]  And in my case in San Francisco, I mean, I get one dot of coverage so much at the time
[10:40.360 --> 10:44.200]  with AT&T, which luckily is great because I don't use the phone hardly at all.
[10:44.200 --> 10:47.720]  But you know, it's just, it's interesting to me, like how you take being a commodity
[10:47.720 --> 10:51.320]  business, you know, that's been around for a long time and, you know, because of the
[10:51.320 --> 10:55.760]  nature of the business can never really be that innovative that fast.
[10:55.760 --> 10:56.760]  So what do you do?
[10:56.760 --> 10:59.240]  Well, you sell iPhones or you sell Samsung tablets or whatever, but it's interesting
[10:59.240 --> 11:03.020]  like what they want in the case of Xfinity, like here's what we want you to know us for.
[11:03.020 --> 11:05.960]  We want you to know us for this thing called Xfinity.
[11:05.960 --> 11:08.320]  And you know, the way that they're actually making all their money, who knows how they're
[11:08.320 --> 11:13.160]  actually making all their money, but they want to be known for as well as this like
[11:13.160 --> 11:17.240]  lifestyle product that's completely up to date and innovative, you know?
[11:17.240 --> 11:18.240]  Yeah.
[11:18.240 --> 11:19.240]  Does that make sense?
[11:19.240 --> 11:21.960]  You know, it's just that you, when you're talking about like fiber and stuff like that,
[11:21.960 --> 11:24.800]  that's not something you do as easily as you change a logo.
[11:24.800 --> 11:28.480]  I mean, these are, there's a lot of infrastructure behind what all these companies do.
[11:28.480 --> 11:33.720]  And certainly you can spin up various kinds of data centers and CDNs or whatever, but
[11:33.720 --> 11:37.000]  at the same time, I mean, that's all just changing so fast.
[11:37.000 --> 11:41.760]  Right now, Comcast is a coaxial cable that comes into my house that lets me stream things
[11:41.760 --> 11:45.060]  and, you know, and use the internet, but we don't have cable TV.
[11:45.060 --> 11:50.440]  We don't, you know, I should talk about my MLB experience, another great one, but no,
[11:50.440 --> 11:54.600]  but for me, that's just, that's a dumb cable that comes in and it's a zero or one.
[11:54.600 --> 11:56.760]  It either works fine or it doesn't.
[11:56.760 --> 12:02.400]  And that's, that's the entire Xfinity value proposition to me.
[12:02.400 --> 12:03.400]  Dogs chasing cats.
[12:03.400 --> 12:04.400]  Yeah.
[12:04.400 --> 12:05.400]  Look at that guy.
[12:05.400 --> 12:06.400]  I see the cat's got a drop shadow.
[12:06.400 --> 12:07.400]  Yeah.
[12:07.400 --> 12:08.400]  It looks like it's probably noon.
[12:08.400 --> 12:10.140]  It's in, it looks like it might be inside Johnny Ives bubble.
[12:10.140 --> 12:14.960]  It's very white except for the Xfinity van and the cones and the man and the bird doesn't
[12:14.960 --> 12:15.960]  get a drop shadow.
[12:15.960 --> 12:16.960]  I'll come.
[12:16.960 --> 12:19.680]  How come the, I just noticed this is another detail here.
[12:19.680 --> 12:26.260]  The icon next to get a, it says get a one time text when services restored and the icon
[12:26.260 --> 12:32.320]  next to it is a, a power power outlet, 110, you know, plug, it's an American electric
[12:32.320 --> 12:33.320]  plug.
[12:33.320 --> 12:34.320]  Yeah.
[12:34.320 --> 12:37.160]  I don't get it.
[12:37.160 --> 12:38.160]  Yeah.
[12:38.160 --> 12:43.640]  What are the other, I see there's like a, a read mores, like a three dot interface here.
[12:43.640 --> 12:46.720]  If you click those arrows and go to the other pages, what do you get?
[12:46.720 --> 12:52.160]  Uh, it's, it's changed cause in the meantime I've gone through the, the one I signed up
[12:52.160 --> 12:55.080]  to get that text.
[12:55.080 --> 12:59.320]  There's a hello John Xfinity fall TV sweepstakes.
[12:59.320 --> 13:07.080]  Uh, you can learn more about the NBCs, the voice, uh, what's this one here?
[13:07.080 --> 13:13.320]  The second one is refer your friends to Xfinity and get up to $500 in visa prepaid cards.
[13:13.320 --> 13:20.540]  Can you imagine how much money went into the series of meetings about synergy, which that's
[13:20.540 --> 13:21.540]  the result.
[13:21.540 --> 13:26.240]  I got, it's like, hold on a second, I got to send you this dog.
[13:26.240 --> 13:28.560]  The dog is still there chasing the cat.
[13:28.560 --> 13:30.440]  Oh my God.
[13:30.440 --> 13:33.360]  Okay, I got it.
[13:33.360 --> 13:34.700]  The bird is still there.
[13:34.700 --> 13:39.640]  The bird doesn't move.
[13:39.640 --> 13:41.280]  What horrific dreamscape is this?
[13:41.280 --> 13:42.280]  Hello, John.
[13:42.280 --> 13:43.280]  All caps.
[13:43.280 --> 13:48.420]  Refer your friends to Xfinity registered trademark and get up to $500 in visa prepaid cards.
[13:48.420 --> 13:55.160]  So you got, you got, you got a whole bunch of, uh, kind of foreshortened like perspective
[13:55.160 --> 13:57.280]  having visa cards.
[13:57.280 --> 14:03.520]  You got despicable me running on a screen and a tablet with a, with a game controller,
[14:03.520 --> 14:08.560]  someone yelling into someone's ear on a laptop image and then a dog chasing the cat the other
[14:08.560 --> 14:09.560]  way.
[14:09.560 --> 14:12.340]  One goes one way, one goes the other way.
[14:12.340 --> 14:13.340]  So what?
[14:13.340 --> 14:15.080]  There's the, yeah, that's, that's terrific, John.
[14:15.080 --> 14:16.080]  You should do that.
[14:16.080 --> 14:17.080]  You should refer some people to Xfinity.
[14:17.080 --> 14:19.800]  Yeah, I feel like I'm doing that right now.
[14:19.800 --> 14:20.800]  Yeah.
[14:20.800 --> 14:21.800]  Yeah.
[14:21.800 --> 14:22.800]  Yeah.
[14:22.800 --> 14:24.600]  That's an unrecognized revenue stream right there.
[14:24.600 --> 14:29.720]  There's like, there's, I always have so many opportunities to suggest new cable providers
[14:29.720 --> 14:30.720]  to my friends.
[14:30.720 --> 14:31.720]  I'm having drinks.
[14:31.720 --> 14:35.440]  Honestly, I'm, there must be some reason for it, but why would they, why would my reward
[14:35.440 --> 14:37.600]  come in the form of prepaid visa cards?
[14:37.600 --> 14:41.420]  Like I'm a drug dealer or something.
[14:41.420 --> 14:45.480]  Why wouldn't they just give me credit on my bill?
[14:45.480 --> 14:51.640]  I don't know, or special access to behind the scenes stuff from the voice.
[14:51.640 --> 14:53.320]  I really don't get it at the grand prize.
[14:53.320 --> 14:55.880]  You can win a $10,000, $10,000.
[14:55.880 --> 14:59.920]  I don't know if that's cash or in visa cards plus a trip for two to the voice finale in
[14:59.920 --> 15:01.080]  Los Angeles.
[15:01.080 --> 15:02.080]  Amy would love that.
[15:02.080 --> 15:04.760]  I bet she loves the voice.
[15:04.760 --> 15:11.440]  I can't help but feel that ultimately Comcast should be a very like or anybody like that
[15:11.440 --> 15:20.320]  with a company with millions of customers all paying like 100 to $200 a month for service
[15:20.320 --> 15:24.760]  that, you know, it was like a one time infrastructure layout to, you know, put the cable in the
[15:24.760 --> 15:27.760]  streets and through the polls and everything and in everybody's houses.
[15:27.760 --> 15:32.140]  I mean, obviously, you know, there's to get from where nobody had cable in America to
[15:32.140 --> 15:34.880]  where everybody has cable running into their house.
[15:34.880 --> 15:36.000]  That's an accomplishment, right?
[15:36.000 --> 15:37.580]  But that's all in the past.
[15:37.580 --> 15:38.580]  It's all there now.
[15:38.580 --> 15:39.580]  It just runs.
[15:39.580 --> 15:46.200]  It should really just be like, like a 25 person company.
[15:46.200 --> 15:47.200]  Just answering calls.
[15:47.200 --> 15:51.600]  Yeah, just answering some calls and you know, mostly mostly just, you know, field, you know,
[15:51.600 --> 15:54.960]  guys who go out in the field and troubleshoot problems and stuff like that.
[15:54.960 --> 15:58.360]  Like there's no real reason for Comcast to exist as a very large corporation.
[15:58.360 --> 16:00.440]  Well, and that's the irony.
[16:00.440 --> 16:04.960]  I remember gosh, years ago you talking about wasn't that was a Comcast where they you had
[16:04.960 --> 16:08.240]  to get the special DRM card for your cable box.
[16:08.240 --> 16:09.240]  Oh, yeah.
[16:09.240 --> 16:12.360]  He came out and he brought one that didn't work.
[16:12.360 --> 16:13.360]  Exactly one.
[16:13.360 --> 16:15.840]  And then he came back.
[16:15.840 --> 16:23.040]  It was it was a two cable card TiVo and he came out and it was like he had one that worked
[16:23.040 --> 16:24.840]  and one that didn't.
[16:24.840 --> 16:27.640]  And he's like, I'm going to go get some more cards and I was like, well, are they in your
[16:27.640 --> 16:32.320]  truck and he goes, No, no, I got it.
[16:32.320 --> 16:34.760]  And like the next time I know it was always a different guy.
[16:34.760 --> 16:35.760]  It wasn't like the same guy.
[16:35.760 --> 16:38.160]  Maybe you're skipping the great part because then you didn't you have to make a new appointment?
[16:38.160 --> 16:40.400]  Yeah, I had to make a new appointment.
[16:40.400 --> 16:42.320]  It's like, what are you doing Friday?
[16:42.320 --> 16:50.120]  It's like, I guess I'm waiting for you know, and ultimately, a guy came and he had one
[16:50.120 --> 16:53.840]  always with only two guards every time and I'd always say like, Well, can you put out
[16:53.840 --> 16:54.960]  like on the third visit?
[16:54.960 --> 17:00.000]  I was like, Can you please put down to tell the guy to bring a whole box full of these
[17:00.000 --> 17:01.000]  cards?
[17:01.000 --> 17:02.940]  And he was like, Well, we don't usually do that.
[17:02.940 --> 17:06.200]  And I was like, What do you think maybe you should I was like, this is the third one.
[17:06.200 --> 17:07.680]  Just bring a whole stack of them.
[17:07.680 --> 17:11.440]  Obviously, some of these things work, some of them half work, and some don't work.
[17:11.440 --> 17:16.480]  So we wound up with with, like on the third one, we got a fully working cable card.
[17:16.480 --> 17:21.560]  And then the second cable card got everything except HBO, and like a Showtime or whatever,
[17:21.560 --> 17:26.240]  you know, like whatever the pay channels are premium stuff, and I was like, good enough.
[17:26.240 --> 17:32.240]  So like, every time we wanted to TiVo, like an HBO show, we'd have a 50% shot that it
[17:32.240 --> 17:36.680]  would be just a black screen for the hour of the broadcast.
[17:36.680 --> 17:41.360]  So we just set up the TiVo I say we Amy's actually the TiVo runner of the house.
[17:41.360 --> 17:42.460]  She set it up.
[17:42.460 --> 17:47.920]  So that any of the HBO shows that we wanted, we would, she would just set the TiVo to record
[17:47.920 --> 17:48.920]  all of them.
[17:48.920 --> 17:52.920]  You know, like, so like, when the new episode of the sopranos came out, just keep recording
[17:52.920 --> 17:54.260]  it over and over again.
[17:54.260 --> 17:58.140]  Because if you do, you know, and there's like eight copies of it on the TiVo one, there's
[17:58.140 --> 18:02.720]  a good chance one of them is going to work Xfinity, it's all about improving your chances.
[18:02.720 --> 18:06.540]  Now we that was years ago, we now have a new TiVo that I don't know what it's got some
[18:06.540 --> 18:11.200]  different kind of cable card, but that's good now.
[18:11.200 --> 18:14.520]  But the beauty part of your what you're describing here, we get the 25 people answering phones
[18:14.520 --> 18:21.400]  is, I mean, I I cannot begin to first of all, let's be honest, you're not gonna, I mean,
[18:21.400 --> 18:25.720]  I'm gonna troubleshoot the shit out of everything that I can like, I just sent you that URL,
[18:25.720 --> 18:26.720]  right?
[18:26.720 --> 18:27.720]  Right.
[18:27.720 --> 18:28.720]  I know how to get to the Motorola surfboard.
[18:28.720 --> 18:29.720]  I know how to go in and do things.
[18:29.720 --> 18:30.720]  I know how to hack on this a little bit.
[18:30.720 --> 18:34.720]  I know how to go unhook and rehook every cable and you know, I learned a long time ago not
[18:34.720 --> 18:38.800]  to be that guy if you do call, but if I've reached completely reached the end of my rope,
[18:38.800 --> 18:41.680]  I will, I will, you know, you end up calling them and you go through the thing, you try
[18:41.680 --> 18:46.640]  and get, you know, pushed up to higher level tech support and stuff like that because everything
[18:46.640 --> 18:52.240]  apparently is a black box when it comes to doing anything with coaxial cable.
[18:52.240 --> 18:56.240]  And the irony is that, well, first of all, when they do send somebody out to your house,
[18:56.240 --> 19:01.720]  you know, whenever, usually a week later, it's a complete, in my experience, a complete
[19:01.720 --> 19:03.640]  crapshoot what you're going to get.
[19:03.640 --> 19:08.340]  So like a lot of times you get like, you know, Bob Hoskins from Brazil and this guy comes
[19:08.340 --> 19:12.040]  out and his white, you know, F one 50 and he's got a, he's got a magnetic sign on the
[19:12.040 --> 19:13.040]  side.
[19:13.040 --> 19:17.080]  It's like the equivalent of like holding a finger up for a mustache and I work for Comcast.
[19:17.080 --> 19:18.960]  He's got like a magnetic sign that goes, it's okay.
[19:18.960 --> 19:19.960]  It's cool.
[19:19.960 --> 19:23.240]  I'm actually Comcast, even though he's not, he's a contractor and these guys come out
[19:23.240 --> 19:28.200]  there and what's funny is like every fifth visit, you know, like every two years I get
[19:28.200 --> 19:32.760]  somebody else to come out for some reason, there'll be like, there's been like probably
[19:32.760 --> 19:35.040]  eight people that came out and made a big mess.
[19:35.040 --> 19:37.840]  And then every few years somebody comes out and cleans up the mess.
[19:37.840 --> 19:38.840]  This woman is awesome.
[19:38.840 --> 19:41.700]  This awesome Gulf war veteran woman came out and she's like, well, I can tell you why it's
[19:41.700 --> 19:45.080]  not working because these dinguses just keep hanging up all these junctions.
[19:45.080 --> 19:47.080]  You realize you're losing this much of a percentage of it.
[19:47.080 --> 19:48.360]  I'm like, wow, you're magic.
[19:48.360 --> 19:51.280]  She's like, yeah, I just took out about 40 feet, 40 feet of cable.
[19:51.280 --> 19:54.480]  That's why you weren't getting a signal because they just kept spaghetti and new stuff in.
[19:54.480 --> 19:55.480]  They don't want to drill a hole.
[19:55.480 --> 19:59.220]  Oh my gosh, I'm going to need a special form for that, but you know, it really depends
[19:59.220 --> 20:00.220]  on what you get.
[20:00.220 --> 20:03.520]  There are people who come out and just don't have the slightest idea how to fix anything
[20:03.520 --> 20:07.480]  but the most trivial thing and other people who like you get like $500 worth of service
[20:07.480 --> 20:08.480]  from them.
[20:08.480 --> 20:12.260]  I, I've had this similar experience, exact same where it's sometimes, you know, you get,
[20:12.260 --> 20:19.580]  you get the Robert De Niro character from Brazil who actually knows how to fix things.
[20:19.580 --> 20:23.320]  And I remember one time it was the same thing where there was a guy who was like testing
[20:23.320 --> 20:26.720]  our signal outside the house and he was like, it's pretty good out there.
[20:26.720 --> 20:27.720]  Yeah.
[20:27.720 --> 20:31.000]  You know, like he was good enough or even, even that he just said pretty good.
[20:31.000 --> 20:34.760]  He's like, it's all right because, but here at your, in your living room, this is, this
[20:34.760 --> 20:35.760]  is terrible.
[20:35.760 --> 20:36.760]  You lose, something's going on.
[20:36.760 --> 20:41.240]  So he like, I don't know, it was like some kind of terrible spider web of junctions.
[20:41.240 --> 20:42.240]  I had no idea.
[20:42.240 --> 20:46.400]  I thought it was a zero in one thing, but apparently you lose a lot of, I guess decibels
[20:46.400 --> 20:51.080]  or whatever of strength with each, you know, however many feet of coax you add, it can
[20:51.080 --> 20:52.080]  actually has a huge effect.
[20:52.080 --> 20:55.800]  And if that's zero, if the one, the one will flip back to a zero and you just won't be
[20:55.800 --> 20:57.040]  enough to drive your router.
[20:57.040 --> 20:58.040]  Right.
[20:58.040 --> 21:04.280]  You know, those, those like a coaxial, like why splitters y'all God, yes, I sure do.
[21:04.280 --> 21:08.760]  He came up, he came up from like our downstairs, like our basement with, with this one.
[21:08.760 --> 21:13.360]  And he is, he's, this is what he said he took out and it had like, it was like, it was literally
[21:13.360 --> 21:14.360]  rusted.
[21:14.360 --> 21:18.580]  It was, it was rusty and he goes, well, I took this out and he goes, it wasn't even
[21:18.580 --> 21:19.580]  doing anything.
[21:19.580 --> 21:22.080]  It wasn't, there wasn't, you know, like the split wasn't going anywhere.
[21:22.080 --> 21:27.520]  It was just somebody, somebody used it to, you know, string more cable together.
[21:27.520 --> 21:29.560]  We came home one day and came upstairs.
[21:29.560 --> 21:31.160]  Everything was dead, dead, dead, dead.
[21:31.160 --> 21:32.160]  The bill was paid.
[21:32.160 --> 21:33.160]  Everything was dead.
[21:33.160 --> 21:38.100]  I went downstairs and I did my usual troubleshooting on the incredibly ancient equipment.
[21:38.100 --> 21:44.140]  And it was really obvious that someone had, had basically had cut the cable to our house
[21:44.140 --> 21:47.840]  and then wide off the cable to go into our neighbor's house.
[21:47.840 --> 21:50.840]  And at first I thought it might be our, our, our Mookie neighbors wanting to watch the
[21:50.840 --> 21:52.860]  Superbowl for free or something like that.
[21:52.860 --> 21:57.960]  But I called Comcast and what it became apparent once we got it, one of the actual useful people
[21:57.960 --> 22:00.800]  out there was that that was just what they thought needed to be done.
[22:00.800 --> 22:02.960]  They thought, oh, we don't need this cable over here.
[22:02.960 --> 22:04.480]  Obviously there's only one house here.
[22:04.480 --> 22:06.040]  We'll cut this one off and just put this one here.
[22:06.040 --> 22:11.720]  So they cut off literally physically cut off the cable and then reconnected it to our neighbors.
[22:11.720 --> 22:15.120]  Like you know, like, like a 1920s switchboard.
[22:15.120 --> 22:19.640]  I think I've told this story, but it was many, many years ago.
[22:19.640 --> 22:25.320]  But when I was the best cable experience I've ever had was when I was in college I had lived
[22:25.320 --> 22:26.760]  like my last few years in college.
[22:26.760 --> 22:34.480]  We had a big, big six bedroom apartment in West Philly and six, you know, six roommates.
[22:34.480 --> 22:38.940]  Everybody got a room and we called to get the, the cable service and the guy who came
[22:38.940 --> 22:44.960]  out was, I want to say Russian, but you know, he had some kind of Eastern European accent
[22:44.960 --> 22:49.840]  and he's hooking up our cable up, you know, on the up and up.
[22:49.840 --> 22:51.440]  And I forget who it was.
[22:51.440 --> 22:54.800]  It wasn't me, but one of my roommates said something to him about,
[22:54.800 --> 23:01.800]  talk a little bit of the code for any extra services.
[23:01.800 --> 23:09.840]  He was like, gee, he goes, I've heard about, there's some way to say, here's what I remember.
[23:09.840 --> 23:14.880]  I don't want to say his name because I don't want to embarrass him, but he called him smoker
[23:14.880 --> 23:15.880]  channels.
[23:15.880 --> 23:29.160]  He was like, yeah, there's some way that you can get the smoker channels for free.
[23:29.160 --> 23:32.320]  The guy just stops.
[23:32.320 --> 23:36.960]  And I thought at first when he stopped that it was like, like when you offer a cop a bribe
[23:36.960 --> 23:41.680]  and then all of a sudden it's like, now you're in trouble for, for giving a, you know, a
[23:41.680 --> 23:42.680]  cop a bribe.
[23:42.680 --> 23:46.440]  And the guy says and said, would you, you know, would you like something like that?
[23:46.440 --> 23:50.040]  And he's, and, and we were all like, yeah, yeah, what would it take?
[23:50.040 --> 23:53.600]  And he goes, he goes, well, I could come back to, I don't work tomorrow because I could
[23:53.600 --> 23:59.420]  come back here tomorrow and, and do this on my own time.
[23:59.420 --> 24:05.180]  And it would, and I forget what he asked for, I don't know, like 200 bucks or something.
[24:05.180 --> 24:06.180]  And we all agreed.
[24:06.180 --> 24:07.180]  Yeah.
[24:07.180 --> 24:10.560]  So right there on the spot, he called in and we heard him, he called into like his supervisor
[24:10.560 --> 24:13.280]  and said, yeah, I'm at whatever our address was.
[24:13.280 --> 24:15.800]  He goes, yeah, they, they no longer want service.
[24:15.800 --> 24:18.000]  Yeah, they don't want any, they can't afford it.
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.080]  They don't want any things.
[24:20.080 --> 24:21.800]  So just cancel it, you know, shut them off.
[24:21.800 --> 24:23.880]  And he goes, all right, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[24:23.880 --> 24:28.840]  And he comes back the next day and he's just like in street clothes and he had like a box
[24:28.840 --> 24:32.080]  and he gave us, it was like a, he, he brought everything.
[24:32.080 --> 24:33.080]  We didn't have to do anything.
[24:33.080 --> 24:39.080]  He just had like a cable box and he went out and climbed up like the pole outside our apartment.
[24:39.080 --> 24:45.160]  And next thing you know, we had a cable service that got us everything and we never paid it.
[24:45.160 --> 24:46.700]  We never paid anything for it.
[24:46.700 --> 24:49.520]  We paid the guy like 200 bucks one time.
[24:49.520 --> 24:51.960]  And then that would have been, that would have been back then even that would have been
[24:51.960 --> 24:54.720]  like at least 50 bucks a month, something like that.
[24:54.720 --> 24:57.240]  I might be slightly misremembering.
[24:57.240 --> 25:01.120]  It might be that we, maybe we had to, I don't think we paid anything.
[25:01.120 --> 25:02.240]  I think we paid nothing.
[25:02.240 --> 25:03.240]  We just had it all.
[25:03.240 --> 25:04.240]  That's how it worked.
[25:04.240 --> 25:05.240]  That's how it worked back then.
[25:05.240 --> 25:08.480]  I mean, if you had the right box with the, I mean, it was all, it was all physical stuff.
[25:08.480 --> 25:11.920]  I mean, I remember around that same time, maybe a little earlier, there was an old trick
[25:11.920 --> 25:15.840]  with the kind of cable boxes we had for maybe cable vision or whatever it was, where you
[25:15.840 --> 25:21.160]  take a certain kind of cardboard, there was a certain thickness and you fold it on the
[25:21.160 --> 25:26.560]  end about certain amount, like a half an inch, and you slide it into the top of the cable
[25:26.560 --> 25:29.160]  box in a little crack, right?
[25:29.160 --> 25:33.720]  The little, you know, and you pull it back and suddenly you get all the smoker channels.
[25:33.720 --> 25:34.720]  You get everything.
[25:34.720 --> 25:35.720]  Really?
[25:35.720 --> 25:39.560]  Yeah, well that basically meant you get Showtime, HBO, Cinemax, and whatever the other one was.
[25:39.560 --> 25:40.760]  Yeah, movie channel.
[25:40.760 --> 25:41.760]  We got everything.
[25:41.760 --> 25:43.080]  We got pay per view.
[25:43.080 --> 25:44.080]  You're kidding.
[25:44.080 --> 25:47.860]  No, we got, because I remember I used to be into boxing, you know, not like seriously,
[25:47.860 --> 25:48.860]  but like,
[25:48.860 --> 25:49.860]  that was expensive.
[25:49.860 --> 25:50.860]  Those things are expensive.
[25:50.860 --> 25:51.860]  Yeah, like Tyson.
[25:51.860 --> 25:55.840]  It was like, you know, in the 90s and Tyson was still fighting.
[25:55.840 --> 25:58.920]  The one I remember specifically, we even, you know, we used to invite people over because,
[25:58.920 --> 26:02.040]  you know, you couldn't watch those things without, you know, without paying.
[26:02.040 --> 26:03.880]  But we, I remember the one, remember the one that was crazy.
[26:03.880 --> 26:05.760]  It was like boxing was like pro wrestling back then.
[26:05.760 --> 26:11.700]  It was the one where the fan man, it was an outdoor fight and the guy on a parachute came
[26:11.700 --> 26:13.160]  into the ring in the middle of the fight.
[26:13.160 --> 26:14.160]  You remember that?
[26:14.160 --> 26:15.960]  Oh no, I don't remember that.
[26:15.960 --> 26:20.360]  This is like really happened, like in the middle of a Mike Tyson heavyweight bout.
[26:20.360 --> 26:25.000]  This guy named Fan Man, I don't know where his name came from, but he had like a parasail
[26:25.000 --> 26:30.160]  and he like came into the ring and they had to like stop the fight and beat this guy up
[26:30.160 --> 26:32.560]  and get him out before they resumed the fight.
[26:32.560 --> 26:34.280]  Riddick Bowe versus Evander Holyfield.
[26:34.280 --> 26:35.280]  All right.
[26:35.280 --> 26:36.280]  It wasn't Tyson, Holyfield.
[26:36.280 --> 26:37.840]  Look at that.
[26:37.840 --> 26:38.840]  Wow.
[26:38.840 --> 26:39.840]  That was real.
[26:39.840 --> 26:40.840]  And I had that.
[26:40.840 --> 26:41.840]  We got that for free.
[26:41.840 --> 26:42.840]  And he passed.
[26:42.840 --> 26:43.840]  He passed in 2002.
[26:43.840 --> 26:44.840]  Sorry to say.
[26:44.840 --> 26:45.840]  Oh, that's Fan Man passed.
[26:45.840 --> 26:46.840]  I didn't know that.
[26:46.840 --> 26:47.840]  R.I.P.
[26:47.840 --> 26:48.840]  Fan Man.
[26:48.840 --> 26:50.240]  That wasn't that many years after it happened.
[26:50.240 --> 26:52.640]  It was probably like what, 95?
[26:52.640 --> 26:53.640]  Uh.
[26:53.640 --> 26:54.640]  96.
[26:54.640 --> 27:00.280]  He's a parachutist and paraglider pilot from Henderson, Nevada known for his appearances.
[27:00.280 --> 27:04.200]  His most famous appearance was the November 6th, 1993 boxing match between Evander Holyfield
[27:04.200 --> 27:06.360]  and Riddick Bowe at Caesars Palace.
[27:06.360 --> 27:11.000]  Fan Man made headlines when he used his powered paraglider to fly into the arena, eventually
[27:11.000 --> 27:12.400]  crashing into the ring.
[27:12.400 --> 27:13.400]  Damn.
[27:13.400 --> 27:14.400]  Oh man.
[27:14.400 --> 27:15.400]  Dogs chasing cats.
[27:15.400 --> 27:16.400]  These dogs chasing cats.
[27:16.400 --> 27:22.000]  You got to get, you got to fix, the thing is the cone that's standing up looks like
[27:22.000 --> 27:23.640]  it's fine.
[27:23.640 --> 27:28.040]  It seems like he would work on the 12 foot cone that had fallen over, but you know, I'm
[27:28.040 --> 27:31.800]  not an Xfinity mechanic.
[27:31.800 --> 27:35.000]  I want to just take a break and I'm going to thank our first sponsor and these guys
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.000]  are great.
[27:37.000 --> 27:38.720]  Need is our friends at Need.
[27:38.720 --> 27:43.280]  Need is a refined retailer and lifestyle magazine for men.
[27:43.280 --> 27:48.320]  Each month, Need sources and curates a selection of exclusive products from brands around the
[27:48.320 --> 27:53.120]  world and they're presented in a monthly editorial, a lot like what you'd expect in any contemporary
[27:53.120 --> 27:54.800]  men's magazine.
[27:54.800 --> 27:58.920]  They shoot all their own photos, they hire independent photographers, so there's a lot
[27:58.920 --> 28:03.080]  of independent photographers who are making good money from this too.
[28:03.080 --> 28:07.440]  They just celebrated their first anniversary on November 5th.
[28:07.440 --> 28:09.440]  Now as we record, that's just yesterday, literally.
[28:09.440 --> 28:15.440]  I mean this is, we're talking right on the anniversary and so they're launching to celebrate
[28:15.440 --> 28:16.440]  that.
[28:16.440 --> 28:21.320]  A full redesign introducing an all exclusive, all limited edition collection with their
[28:21.320 --> 28:26.320]  favorite brands from the whole past year and they've also launched a new concept called
[28:26.320 --> 28:32.800]  Essentials Essentials where they're offering ongoing ever changing collections for men's
[28:32.800 --> 28:37.400]  everyday staple items, stuff you need to, you know, like grooming products and stuff
[28:37.400 --> 28:43.280]  like that, coffee, stuff that you want to, you know, keep coming in on a regular basis.
[28:43.280 --> 28:47.880]  They've more than doubled their return window for stuff that you want to send back.
[28:47.880 --> 28:53.440]  They've launched favoriting of products which makes it sort of like a private need specific
[28:53.440 --> 28:59.040]  version of Pinterest for the things that you like and best of all, this is very important
[28:59.040 --> 29:05.400]  for my audience, they've just launched shipping to Canada.
[29:05.400 --> 29:09.400]  So in celebration, here's what they've got.
[29:09.400 --> 29:10.400]  Talk show listeners.
[29:10.400 --> 29:11.400]  Now this is the thing with need.
[29:11.400 --> 29:15.960]  Need is, they're sort of like a lean and mean organization and I've heard them do the same
[29:15.960 --> 29:18.000]  thing on other shows like ATP.
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.580]  They don't have any kind of special coupon code or anything like that.
[29:20.580 --> 29:24.280]  You just sign up.
[29:24.280 --> 29:31.680]  You go to neededition.com I believe is the URL.
[29:31.680 --> 29:33.680]  That's where you go to find out more and sign up.
[29:33.680 --> 29:40.300]  Need edition, not a edition like math, like edition like it's an edition of the magazine.
[29:40.300 --> 29:43.420]  Go to neededition.com and that's where you sign up for this thing.
[29:43.420 --> 29:45.360]  But here's what you can do as a listener of the show.
[29:45.360 --> 29:51.320]  Whenever you sign up and you buy anything, just shoot them an email at hello at neededition.com
[29:51.320 --> 29:55.400]  and in the subject line, put first anniversary.
[29:55.400 --> 30:00.640]  And what they'll do is they'll write back to you, they'll probably say something witty.
[30:00.640 --> 30:03.880]  But then they'll look for your email address and their orders and they're going to throw
[30:03.880 --> 30:06.000]  in a whole bunch of extras.
[30:06.000 --> 30:13.560]  Field notes, t-shirts, socks, I just got email from Matt at neededition that they just got
[30:13.560 --> 30:16.960]  in literally like yesterday.
[30:16.960 --> 30:22.000]  These new Ebbets Field hats, they're gray wool, really cool baseball caps with the Need
[30:22.000 --> 30:27.240]  Edition logo, navy wool, really, really nice stuff, brown leather adjustable strap, like
[30:27.240 --> 30:29.600]  these are like $50 baseball caps.
[30:29.600 --> 30:33.020]  They're going to first five, 10 orders that come in, they're going to just throw those
[30:33.020 --> 30:35.040]  hats in there.
[30:35.040 --> 30:39.020]  Everybody though who orders and you send them an email at hello at neededition with first
[30:39.020 --> 30:45.520]  anniversary in the subject line, you'll get free stuff and all of those people, everybody
[30:45.520 --> 30:50.400]  who does that and sends them that email, they also, they're going to add those people to
[30:50.400 --> 30:55.000]  receive 25% off everything for the next three months.
[30:55.000 --> 30:56.000]  That's huge.
[30:56.000 --> 30:57.000]  25% off.
[30:57.000 --> 31:00.080]  So there's a lot of percent, big percent.
[31:00.080 --> 31:01.080]  It's a great organization.
[31:01.080 --> 31:02.080]  It's a great service.
[31:02.080 --> 31:04.840]  And Matt, I mean, it's amazing what he's done with that in one year.
[31:04.840 --> 31:06.800]  They're really amazing.
[31:06.800 --> 31:11.420]  I think it's one of those things too where it's not like, oh, it launched and it got
[31:11.420 --> 31:16.280]  huge immediately, but I think it's one of those things that could be huge pretty soon
[31:16.280 --> 31:17.480]  because it's very, very cool.
[31:17.480 --> 31:20.080]  Because it just works for a certain kind of brain.
[31:20.080 --> 31:21.920]  My brain needs exactly that help.
[31:21.920 --> 31:26.360]  I don't want to see like 11 different things that I could get, 11 different shirts or 50
[31:26.360 --> 31:27.360]  different shirts.
[31:27.360 --> 31:28.520]  Show me this cool thing.
[31:28.520 --> 31:30.880]  It's very well curated.
[31:30.880 --> 31:31.880]  That's exactly the same here.
[31:31.880 --> 31:34.280]  I can't make decisions.
[31:34.280 --> 31:37.000]  I don't want to see 13 different shirts.
[31:37.000 --> 31:41.240]  Just show me one and then I'll give it a thumbs up or thumbs down.
[31:41.240 --> 31:42.640]  Exactly.
[31:42.640 --> 31:44.280]  So my thanks to them.
[31:44.280 --> 31:46.800]  No dogs, no cats at need addition.
[31:46.800 --> 31:49.280]  I don't believe.
[31:49.280 --> 31:50.280]  My goodness.
[31:50.280 --> 31:54.120]  I've got, are you a Levi's 501 guy?
[31:54.120 --> 31:55.120]  I am.
[31:55.120 --> 31:56.120]  Yeah, me too.
[31:56.120 --> 31:59.520]  So I've got four pairs of Levi's 501s that look like they fell off a hobo and I have
[31:59.520 --> 32:02.360]  exactly one pair of pants that fits me and they're from need.
[32:02.360 --> 32:04.040]  I got one pair of jeans that fits me.
[32:04.040 --> 32:07.080]  It makes me realize what pants that fit feel like.
[32:07.080 --> 32:10.800]  So I don't wear them too much because they're a little bit jarring.
[32:10.800 --> 32:12.400]  I have bones to pick with.
[32:12.400 --> 32:15.840]  I do wear Levi's 501 and a couple of years ago, I tried something else.
[32:15.840 --> 32:16.840]  I think I got something.
[32:16.840 --> 32:18.920]  I went to the – got them from the Gap or something.
[32:18.920 --> 32:19.920]  I don't know.
[32:19.920 --> 32:20.920]  But then they didn't work out either.
[32:20.920 --> 32:25.000]  But my problem with them is they're – what I want is I just want the exact same jeans
[32:25.000 --> 32:27.840]  over and over again and that you can't do that.
[32:27.840 --> 32:33.680]  They're always changing the name of the denim.
[32:33.680 --> 32:35.960]  They've got 40 different names and styles of denim.
[32:35.960 --> 32:36.960]  I just want …
[32:36.960 --> 32:37.960]  Oh my god.
[32:37.960 --> 32:38.960]  Go to the Levi's site.
[32:38.960 --> 32:39.960]  It's completely overwhelming.
[32:39.960 --> 32:40.960]  Right.
[32:40.960 --> 32:41.960]  I was going to try the same thing.
[32:41.960 --> 32:44.840]  I was like, OK, I'm going to find exactly this one, get this skew, buy five of them
[32:44.840 --> 32:46.720]  and then rotate them for the next five years.
[32:46.720 --> 32:47.720]  Yeah.
[32:47.720 --> 32:51.240]  I tried to do that and you can't – I couldn't – the ones I bought the last time aren't
[32:51.240 --> 32:52.240]  there anymore.
[32:52.240 --> 32:54.720]  And I bought them and also the sizes are different.
[32:54.720 --> 32:59.320]  Like I bought a new pair with the exact – they even print the size right on the patch on
[32:59.320 --> 33:00.320]  the back.
[33:00.320 --> 33:01.320]  And now they're …
[33:01.320 --> 33:03.400]  You've got to – I learned this from a female friend of mine in college.
[33:03.400 --> 33:07.040]  She's like, whenever I go try on anything in a store, especially if it's not like
[33:07.040 --> 33:12.800]  super expensive, if it's anything that's like, you know, anything that's not basically
[33:12.800 --> 33:17.360]  like evening wear, take four into the dressing room and try them on in the same size.
[33:17.360 --> 33:18.680]  And I'm like, you are high.
[33:18.680 --> 33:19.920]  There's absolutely no difference.
[33:19.920 --> 33:21.840]  And there totally is a difference.
[33:21.840 --> 33:22.840]  And look no further.
[33:22.840 --> 33:26.480]  Go grab – after the program, go grab a bunch of pairs of 501s and look what country they're
[33:26.480 --> 33:27.480]  made in.
[33:27.480 --> 33:30.880]  So if you're wondering why, I mean, I've got some that are from Mexico.
[33:30.880 --> 33:34.560]  I've got some that are from like Central America.
[33:34.560 --> 33:39.200]  I mean, just to say that it isn't like there's like this one lady in San Francisco that's
[33:39.200 --> 33:40.200]  making all these jeans.
[33:40.200 --> 33:41.200]  There's a lot of variation.
[33:41.200 --> 33:43.920]  I bet the cotton is different in a lot of them.
[33:43.920 --> 33:45.240]  You've got to try them on.
[33:45.240 --> 33:46.240]  Yeah.
[33:46.240 --> 33:49.840]  But that's like what I – I think you're exactly right.
[33:49.840 --> 33:52.080]  But I hate it because that's not what I want to do.
[33:52.080 --> 33:56.760]  The whole point of knowing my size and knowing that I want Levi's model 501 is I want to
[33:56.760 --> 33:58.960]  just order them online.
[33:58.960 --> 34:03.200]  I buy clothes like other people buy beer where I just – I'll just go like American Apparel
[34:03.200 --> 34:04.200]  white t-shirts.
[34:04.200 --> 34:05.200]  Boom.
[34:05.200 --> 34:06.200]  Send me a pack of those.
[34:06.200 --> 34:10.600]  That's how I want it to be almost like a paper towel dispenser at my kid's elementary school.
[34:10.600 --> 34:12.280]  I want it to be so straightforward.
[34:12.280 --> 34:16.040]  I buy exactly the same socks, exactly the same shirts.
[34:16.040 --> 34:18.920]  And then when they change for some reason, you're like, oh, this got really – this
[34:18.920 --> 34:19.920]  got a little too silky.
[34:19.920 --> 34:20.920]  It seems really weird.
[34:20.920 --> 34:22.800]  I feel really undermined by the brand.
[34:22.800 --> 34:23.800]  Yeah.
[34:23.800 --> 34:28.160]  I feel like Steve Jobs sort of had it right where he – where everybody thought it was
[34:28.160 --> 34:31.200]  sort of eccentric but where he was like, this is it.
[34:31.200 --> 34:36.040]  He had that Japanese designer give him like 75 of those black shirts and that was it.
[34:36.040 --> 34:38.280]  I think it's the smartest thing in the world.
[34:38.280 --> 34:42.160]  I mean you just don't want to have to – you shouldn't have to think about that stuff.
[34:42.160 --> 34:46.200]  And the problem is once you become a little eclectic, then you kind of got to become really
[34:46.200 --> 34:50.640]  eclectic because you can't have like fucking clown shoes that you wear every day.
[34:50.640 --> 34:52.220]  You've got to have some variation.
[34:52.220 --> 34:54.560]  You have your driving moccasins.
[34:54.560 --> 34:59.240]  The smart part was getting like 75 of them at once rather than say just get the 10 that
[34:59.240 --> 35:03.200]  you need and then as they wear out, you will get more because you can't trust that they're
[35:03.200 --> 35:05.040]  going to be there to get more.
[35:05.040 --> 35:06.040]  You really got to load up.
[35:06.040 --> 35:08.920]  It's also a good reason to maintain your weight as you get older.
[35:08.920 --> 35:09.920]  It is.
[35:09.920 --> 35:10.920]  I think it's a good motivation.
[35:10.920 --> 35:11.920]  Good motivation.
[35:11.920 --> 35:19.000]  A real-time follow-up, the story of Parachutist James Miller aka Fan Man is tragic.
[35:19.000 --> 35:20.000]  He took his own life.
[35:20.000 --> 35:21.000]  He was a young man, took his own life.
[35:21.000 --> 35:22.000]  Oh, yeah.
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.880]  It's just so unusual that he would pass away at that.
[35:24.880 --> 35:25.880]  Yeah.
[35:25.880 --> 35:26.880]  Well, that's –
[35:26.880 --> 35:30.800]  But he had his moment.
[35:30.800 --> 35:35.260]  I suppose it's not surprising that the guy who parachuted live into a heavyweight title
[35:35.260 --> 35:40.960]  fight at Caesars Palace had some mental health issues and I don't even mean to make fun of
[35:40.960 --> 35:41.960]  it.
[35:41.960 --> 35:42.960]  No, no.
[35:42.960 --> 35:45.160]  I'm not – what he did in the fight was funny.
[35:45.160 --> 35:48.720]  Him taking his life is tragic but I suppose it's not that surprising.
[35:48.720 --> 35:50.440]  Did you ever get up on rock and rolling?
[35:50.440 --> 35:51.440]  No.
[35:51.440 --> 35:52.440]  You know about him?
[35:52.440 --> 35:53.440]  No, I don't know.
[35:53.440 --> 35:54.440]  The Rainbow Wig, John 3-16 guy?
[35:54.440 --> 35:55.440]  Oh, yeah.
[35:55.440 --> 35:56.440]  Yeah.
[35:56.440 --> 36:02.320]  As a sports fan, you should know he's had a lot of balls in the air over the years.
[36:02.320 --> 36:03.680]  Is he still around?
[36:03.680 --> 36:04.760]  I don't remember.
[36:04.760 --> 36:08.480]  I think, you know, it started as – but it's funny because in my head I think what are
[36:08.480 --> 36:13.640]  the two of the two characters you remember from early adulthood like that would be parodied
[36:13.640 --> 36:15.800]  on The Simpsons like at a sporting event?
[36:15.800 --> 36:19.960]  Well, there's the guy in the clown wig and there's the guy who holds up the John 3-16
[36:19.960 --> 36:20.960]  sign.
[36:20.960 --> 36:23.560]  And the first amazing thing is that that was the same guy.
[36:23.560 --> 36:26.480]  He changed tack at one point and he went from Rainbow Wig to John 3-16.
[36:26.480 --> 36:27.480]  So that was him.
[36:27.480 --> 36:29.840]  It was the same guy.
[36:29.840 --> 36:33.920]  But I think at some point it ended – again, it's almost making this really sad.
[36:33.920 --> 36:39.520]  I think it ended up with some kind of hostage situation at some point and he, you know,
[36:39.520 --> 36:42.620]  got taken away.
[36:42.620 --> 36:46.120]  So for those of you who don't know, this guy, what was his name?
[36:46.120 --> 36:47.120]  I remember him.
[36:47.120 --> 36:51.120]  The fucking Roland Rainbow.
[36:51.120 --> 36:52.120]  Roland Stewart.
[36:52.120 --> 36:53.120]  There he is.
[36:53.120 --> 36:54.120]  Oh, yeah.
[36:54.120 --> 36:55.120]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:55.120 --> 36:56.120]  Roland Stewart.
[36:56.120 --> 36:57.120]  How do you spell Roland?
[36:57.120 --> 36:58.120]  Send it on the – L-L-E-N.
[36:58.120 --> 37:00.360]  Roland Stewart.
[37:00.360 --> 37:09.840]  He was a guy who would – he would obtain tickets for sporting events that were optimally
[37:09.840 --> 37:15.440]  placed so that he would be on TV like, you know, he was – he knew which tickets to
[37:15.440 --> 37:19.840]  buy that would be within the camera angle that, you know, would be frequent.
[37:19.840 --> 37:21.920]  And he – what did he do first?
[37:21.920 --> 37:22.920]  The Rainbow Wig?
[37:22.920 --> 37:23.920]  Yeah.
[37:23.920 --> 37:24.920]  Started out with the Rainbow.
[37:24.920 --> 37:27.500]  But it's sort of like Marlin's guy where you're like, tell me more about this guy.
[37:27.500 --> 37:32.240]  Like how is it he's always where – he's at so many games in so many places and he's
[37:32.240 --> 37:34.140]  always – he always ends up on camera.
[37:34.140 --> 37:36.680]  And then, of course, enough to become a bit.
[37:36.680 --> 37:40.960]  Started out with the Rainbow Afro Wig and then later on he went to the John 3-16.
[37:40.960 --> 37:41.960]  All right.
[37:41.960 --> 37:44.520]  And then he used to – I remember he – it was always a football game.
[37:44.520 --> 37:45.520]  I remember.
[37:45.520 --> 37:46.520]  He probably did everything.
[37:46.520 --> 37:51.760]  But I remember seeing him on football games and he would – he must have had a lot of
[37:51.760 --> 37:56.200]  money because, you know, there were expensive seats near the front and he had to travel
[37:56.200 --> 38:01.160]  a lot because it wasn't like, oh, he was a guy in Kansas City and he was always at
[38:01.160 --> 38:02.360]  Kansas City Chiefs games.
[38:02.360 --> 38:06.640]  No, he was like every – he was like at the game of the week every week wherever it was.
[38:06.640 --> 38:08.500]  It says – Wikipedia.
[38:08.500 --> 38:12.100]  His first major appearance was at the 1977 NBA Finals.
[38:12.100 --> 38:16.600]  By the time of the 1979 MLB All-Star Game, broadcasters actively tried to avoid showing
[38:16.600 --> 38:17.600]  him.
[38:17.600 --> 38:21.080]  Then you get him here behind the goal post, Olympic medal stands, Augusta National Golf
[38:21.080 --> 38:27.020]  Club, 1982 Indianapolis 500, behind the pits of Gordon Johncock and eventually he got commercials
[38:27.020 --> 38:28.020]  and stuff.
[38:28.020 --> 38:29.020]  But, you know.
[38:29.020 --> 38:33.980]  I'm surprised that he got in at Augusta because Augusta seems like the type of place
[38:33.980 --> 38:34.980]  where they –
[38:34.980 --> 38:35.980]  Is that the Masters?
[38:35.980 --> 38:36.980]  Is that where the Masters is?
[38:36.980 --> 38:37.980]  Yeah.
[38:37.980 --> 38:38.980]  That's the Masters.
[38:38.980 --> 38:39.980]  They wouldn't hesitate to, you know, take a guy out behind them.
[38:39.980 --> 38:41.980]  Maybe he had a green jacket, like a green blazer.
[38:41.980 --> 38:47.680]  And a rainbow wig.
[38:47.680 --> 38:53.980]  So he was like the old-time predecessor to this year's Marlins man, who I have to admit
[38:53.980 --> 39:00.260]  I got very into this year with – did you watch any of the baseball?
[39:00.260 --> 39:01.260]  He knew I did.
[39:01.260 --> 39:02.260]  Yeah.
[39:02.260 --> 39:03.660]  It was absolutely fascinating.
[39:03.660 --> 39:07.020]  And so this guy – and I know there's a whole back story behind this and he like – but
[39:07.020 --> 39:10.920]  it was pretty amazing because I can't remember where it started out, but it was – for some
[39:10.920 --> 39:14.380]  reason I think obviously it was most striking in the Kansas – the games that were in Kansas
[39:14.380 --> 39:15.380]  City.
[39:15.380 --> 39:16.380]  Yes.
[39:16.380 --> 39:19.420]  Because it's a complete solid cerulean sea of blue.
[39:19.420 --> 39:20.420]  I mean blue.
[39:20.420 --> 39:22.780]  I mean it's just solid blue.
[39:22.780 --> 39:27.820]  And then this one guy in a traffic cone orange jersey that says Marlins on it.
[39:27.820 --> 39:30.700]  And he is right effing behind home plate.
[39:30.700 --> 39:32.180]  I mean he's right there.
[39:32.180 --> 39:35.100]  And he does this great thing where right when the pitcher's starting to throw he stands
[39:35.100 --> 39:38.820]  up so you can see his Marlins jersey.
[39:38.820 --> 39:39.980]  I don't know what his problem is.
[39:39.980 --> 39:42.260]  It seemed to me like he couldn't stand still.
[39:42.260 --> 39:43.940]  Like I am a baseball fan.
[39:43.940 --> 39:44.940]  So I was mostly watching the game.
[39:44.940 --> 39:45.940]  Maybe he had piles.
[39:45.940 --> 39:48.540]  Maybe he was carbuncular.
[39:48.540 --> 39:52.500]  He didn't seem to be paying attention to the game on a regular basis.
[39:52.500 --> 39:53.500]  At times he was.
[39:53.500 --> 39:54.500]  But there were –
[39:54.500 --> 39:56.500]  He would chat up his seat mates nearby sometimes.
[39:56.500 --> 39:57.500]  Yeah.
[39:57.500 --> 39:58.500]  Yeah.
[39:58.500 --> 40:03.780]  He – again like you said, he was quite incongruous in the games in Kansas City.
[40:03.780 --> 40:08.620]  And hats off to the people of Kansas City for their – like I don't know how many
[40:08.620 --> 40:11.420]  thousand – 45,000, 50,000 people fit in that stadium.
[40:11.420 --> 40:17.540]  And I would say 49,999 of them were wearing Royals blue.
[40:17.540 --> 40:18.860]  It was an impressive sight.
[40:18.860 --> 40:21.140]  It had a lot of spirit too.
[40:21.140 --> 40:25.820]  I mean that was a great series and they fought hard and those fans really – man they lit
[40:25.820 --> 40:26.820]  that place up.
[40:26.820 --> 40:27.820]  Yeah.
[40:27.820 --> 40:28.820]  It was great.
[40:28.820 --> 40:35.060]  But this one guy wearing a bright flaming orange Marlins jacket and hat really stuck
[40:35.060 --> 40:36.060]  out.
[40:36.060 --> 40:37.300]  And he literally right behind home plate.
[40:37.300 --> 40:43.980]  I mean like maybe like out of the 45,000 seats like he was always in maybe one of the two
[40:43.980 --> 40:46.860]  seats that he would be most visible behind the batter.
[40:46.860 --> 40:50.300]  Like there's only like – there's one on the left and one on the right where you're
[40:50.300 --> 40:51.300]  that visible.
[40:51.300 --> 40:52.780]  And he was in that seat all the time.
[40:52.780 --> 40:53.780]  I don't understand.
[40:53.780 --> 40:55.580]  How can you guarantee – how can you buy that?
[40:55.580 --> 40:56.580]  I don't –
[40:56.580 --> 40:59.500]  Somebody – I think Jason Snell sent me an article about this and I looked at it briefly.
[40:59.500 --> 41:03.700]  I think he's like a medical professional, like some kind of a dentist and like he gets
[41:03.700 --> 41:05.900]  these tickets somehow.
[41:05.900 --> 41:10.300]  But I mean if you think about all the work that goes into that, it was in San Francisco
[41:10.300 --> 41:11.300]  too.
[41:11.300 --> 41:12.300]  Right?
[41:12.300 --> 41:13.300]  Right.
[41:13.300 --> 41:14.300]  Yeah.
[41:14.300 --> 41:15.300]  Let's be clear.
[41:15.300 --> 41:20.020]  He was in San Francisco for a few games then he went to Kansas for a few games and so forth
[41:20.020 --> 41:21.020]  and came back.
[41:21.020 --> 41:22.020]  It's – I mean it's –
[41:22.020 --> 41:23.020]  He was at every game.
[41:23.020 --> 41:24.020]  It's a real dedication.
[41:24.020 --> 41:25.020]  Yeah.
[41:25.020 --> 41:26.020]  Yeah.
[41:26.020 --> 41:27.020]  And those are – I – you know and who knows if –
[41:27.020 --> 41:28.020]  What are those?
[41:28.020 --> 41:29.020]  Like a thousand dollars?
[41:29.020 --> 41:31.620]  Oh I think for the World Series it was a lot more.
[41:31.620 --> 41:35.620]  I went on StubHub because I got curious and I was like well what would it cost?
[41:35.620 --> 41:41.940]  And like the seats in the – what's the – is it AT&T?
[41:41.940 --> 41:42.940]  What's the Giants ballpark?
[41:42.940 --> 41:44.060]  That's what it is this week.
[41:44.060 --> 41:45.060]  Yeah.
[41:45.060 --> 41:46.060]  Yeah.
[41:46.060 --> 41:47.060]  Well the Giants ballpark, AT&T.
[41:47.060 --> 41:48.060]  AT&T Park.
[41:48.060 --> 41:49.060]  Yeah.
[41:49.060 --> 41:50.060]  Yeah.
[41:50.060 --> 41:51.060]  AT&T Park.
[41:51.060 --> 41:52.060]  Formerly SBC.
[41:52.060 --> 41:53.060]  Formerly Pac Bell.
[41:53.060 --> 41:58.220]  It – the ones that are that close right behind home plate were thousands of dollars
[41:58.220 --> 41:59.220]  on StubHub.
[41:59.220 --> 42:00.860]  And it's like everything on StubHub.
[42:00.860 --> 42:04.020]  I mean it's – you know, it's a negotiating thing.
[42:04.020 --> 42:08.220]  Is StubHub like a kind of gray market like eBay for tickets or something?
[42:08.220 --> 42:09.220]  Yeah.
[42:09.220 --> 42:10.220]  Yeah.
[42:10.220 --> 42:11.220]  It's – you've never used it?
[42:11.220 --> 42:12.220]  It's amazing.
[42:12.220 --> 42:13.220]  It's truly amazing.
[42:13.220 --> 42:17.820]  It's a great, great service where you can resell tickets and they automate it.
[42:17.820 --> 42:22.340]  And they totally – you can – you know like they stand behind every ticket that they
[42:22.340 --> 42:23.340]  sell.
[42:23.340 --> 42:24.940]  So you don't feel like you're – it's not like eBay.
[42:24.940 --> 42:29.340]  Like StubHub – because you know like with eBay if somebody rips you off you – they
[42:29.340 --> 42:33.780]  have like a mediation but StubHub sort of stands behind it.
[42:33.780 --> 42:37.940]  It's like StubHub buys the ticket from the person and then you're buying the ticket
[42:37.940 --> 42:38.940]  from StubHub.
[42:38.940 --> 42:39.940]  Oh my gosh.
[42:39.940 --> 42:40.940]  That's fantastic.
[42:40.940 --> 42:41.940]  Right.
[42:41.940 --> 42:45.380]  So really what you would hope eBay – what PayPal originally kind of seemed like an – almost
[42:45.380 --> 42:47.380]  escrow but like really hands-on.
[42:47.380 --> 42:49.580]  They take it and make sure it's real incentive.
[42:49.580 --> 42:50.580]  Yeah.
[42:50.580 --> 42:57.500]  And they have offices, physical retail establishments in a lot of – a lot of major cities, most
[42:57.500 --> 42:58.540]  major cities.
[42:58.540 --> 43:03.300]  So if you buy tickets at the last minute, you can go pick them up.
[43:03.300 --> 43:10.700]  Like I bought tickets for a Yankees game in August for the – it was Derek Jeter Day.
[43:10.700 --> 43:11.700]  And I didn't know if we were going to be able to go.
[43:11.700 --> 43:17.820]  And I bought them the day before and it was so easy.
[43:17.820 --> 43:20.580]  We're going to be in New York anyway.
[43:20.580 --> 43:23.740]  This is why I bought the tickets for a thing on Saturday.
[43:23.740 --> 43:27.140]  So we were staying over and just there's a place in Midtown.
[43:27.140 --> 43:33.260]  You just go in and you show them your ID and then they just handed me an envelope with
[43:33.260 --> 43:34.260]  the tickets.
[43:34.260 --> 43:35.260]  That's amazing.
[43:35.260 --> 43:36.260]  Yeah.
[43:36.260 --> 43:38.780]  I had bought them like a day before.
[43:38.780 --> 43:39.780]  But then I didn't have to wait.
[43:39.780 --> 43:41.900]  I mean it's a lot – it certainly must have been a lot of dough.
[43:41.900 --> 43:45.100]  I guess maybe he got them for free or discounted or something.
[43:45.100 --> 43:46.100]  But it's a lot of dedication.
[43:46.100 --> 43:47.100]  No.
[43:47.100 --> 43:48.100]  No.
[43:48.100 --> 43:49.100]  There's no way he had to buy them out.
[43:49.100 --> 43:51.180]  But it's just crazy because somebody has that seat.
[43:51.180 --> 43:54.580]  If there's like a season ticket holder and you're like a fan of the Giants, why would
[43:54.580 --> 43:59.180]  you give up that great seat unless he really made an offer you couldn't refuse?
[43:59.180 --> 44:04.220]  And it's just so funny because it's – for his purposes, it's not just like he wants
[44:04.220 --> 44:05.220]  a good seat.
[44:05.220 --> 44:07.860]  He wants to be – he clearly wants to be on TV.
[44:07.860 --> 44:10.540]  There's only like three or four seats that are…
[44:10.540 --> 44:14.980]  I mean into pound for pound, he's on screen more than anybody but maybe the pitcher and
[44:14.980 --> 44:15.980]  the catcher.
[44:15.980 --> 44:16.980]  Yeah.
[44:16.980 --> 44:17.980]  You know what I mean?
[44:17.980 --> 44:20.820]  If you think about it, I mean that guy is – except for occasionally like he might
[44:20.820 --> 44:24.660]  be obscured by the umpire for a second but he seems to have a really good sense of like
[44:24.660 --> 44:26.900]  where to be to make sure he's on camera.
[44:26.900 --> 44:27.900]  Yeah.
[44:27.900 --> 44:28.900]  Definitely.
[44:28.900 --> 44:29.900]  It seems like it.
[44:29.900 --> 44:33.660]  And it makes a big – like even being in the front row makes such a big – for his
[44:33.660 --> 44:37.060]  purposes makes such a big difference compared to being in the second row.
[44:37.060 --> 44:38.060]  Yeah.
[44:38.060 --> 44:41.420]  It's like something from a different age though because if you think about guys like
[44:41.420 --> 44:47.220]  the parasailing guy or rock and roll or Marlin's guy, I mean it used to be really hard to be
[44:47.220 --> 44:48.220]  famous.
[44:48.220 --> 44:49.220]  Yeah.
[44:49.220 --> 44:51.700]  It took a lot of work to be famous.
[44:51.700 --> 44:54.440]  You know, you had to have a publisher for a book.
[44:54.440 --> 44:59.080]  You had to have an agent to like try and even like beg to get you on TV.
[44:59.080 --> 45:03.700]  It's just like today, there's so many more avenues for becoming slightly famous that
[45:03.700 --> 45:09.620]  I kind of admire the grunt work, you know, on the ground of a medical professional who
[45:09.620 --> 45:15.460]  decides to jet between cities to be on TV in the background.
[45:15.460 --> 45:17.280]  It's wacky world.
[45:17.280 --> 45:20.900]  You know, the – I'm sure you know this because you got into them too, that the Royals
[45:20.900 --> 45:22.780]  tried to buy them out of those seats.
[45:22.780 --> 45:23.780]  Are you kidding?
[45:23.780 --> 45:24.780]  You didn't notice?
[45:24.780 --> 45:25.780]  No.
[45:25.780 --> 45:30.860]  After the first game, the Kansas City Royals, you know, like the organization approached
[45:30.860 --> 45:36.500]  him and said, you know, we – you know, we'd like you to move.
[45:36.500 --> 45:40.300]  We will offer you – we'll trade you for these tickets you already had for this seat.
[45:40.300 --> 45:44.860]  We'll give you a luxury box or, you know, a seat in one of the luxury boxes and, you
[45:44.860 --> 45:51.180]  know, you'll get the full, I don't know, you know, food and beverage, whatever.
[45:51.180 --> 45:55.460]  Please give up your seat and he was like, you know, they – and he, you know, declined
[45:55.460 --> 45:58.300]  because his whole goal – you know, that was the whole point.
[45:58.300 --> 46:03.780]  I don't think they quite understood the psychology of the guy, the psychopathy, you
[46:03.780 --> 46:04.780]  know, that –
[46:04.780 --> 46:05.780]  He's lucky.
[46:05.780 --> 46:08.140]  He's lucky he didn't end up floating in whatever, I guess the Kansas City River.
[46:08.140 --> 46:11.140]  That's – I could see them getting pretty miffed about that.
[46:11.140 --> 46:15.780]  You think about what that ad space cost for all those, you know, the ads that are green
[46:15.780 --> 46:21.660]  screen back there and all the kind of, as they say today, optics of like how you present,
[46:21.660 --> 46:22.660]  you know, your brand.
[46:22.660 --> 46:24.420]  It must have been super annoying to them.
[46:24.420 --> 46:25.420]  Yeah.
[46:25.420 --> 46:27.820]  It makes me wonder how many people out there are going to be inspired by the guy and then
[46:27.820 --> 46:31.660]  if it's going to start like a resurgence in, you know –
[46:31.660 --> 46:32.660]  Yeah.
[46:32.660 --> 46:36.180]  What would you call it?
[46:36.180 --> 46:37.660]  Stick out, you know.
[46:37.660 --> 46:38.660]  Yeah.
[46:38.660 --> 46:39.660]  Yeah.
[46:39.660 --> 46:41.300]  Everybody needs a project.
[46:41.300 --> 46:43.900]  It's important to stay busy, you know, as you get older.
[46:43.900 --> 46:46.020]  But it's like you never really notice the people.
[46:46.020 --> 46:49.700]  There are always people behind home plate or behind the end zone, you know.
[46:49.700 --> 46:52.700]  There's always fans in the front row and you just never notice them really.
[46:52.700 --> 46:56.300]  I mean I guess every once in a while you see Jack Nicholson at a Lakers game or something
[46:56.300 --> 46:57.300]  like that.
[46:57.300 --> 46:58.300]  Right.
[46:58.300 --> 46:59.300]  Right.
[46:59.300 --> 47:00.300]  You show it.
[47:00.300 --> 47:02.860]  But, you know, you just don't notice the fans until they're wearing bright orange
[47:02.860 --> 47:03.860]  marlins jerseys.
[47:03.860 --> 47:08.500]  I had an uneasy moment in one game that made me feel really old.
[47:08.500 --> 47:11.360]  There was this – I'm guessing probably the greatest dad in the world that had brought
[47:11.360 --> 47:13.900]  his kids to the game in Kansas City.
[47:13.900 --> 47:18.020]  But there was this probably like 11-year-old girl sitting in like the fifth row and I was
[47:18.020 --> 47:21.740]  like, man, it's like 11-15.
[47:21.740 --> 47:25.340]  She's out pretty late for a kid her age and I was hoping the game would end because, you
[47:25.340 --> 47:28.100]  know, it was a school night.
[47:28.100 --> 47:30.300]  You don't think about it as like your dad taking you to the World Series.
[47:30.300 --> 47:32.340]  You become an old guy and you start thinking about bedtime.
[47:32.340 --> 47:36.860]  What if she has a math test tomorrow?
[47:36.860 --> 47:37.860]  Exactly.
[47:37.860 --> 47:38.860]  Exactly.
[47:38.860 --> 47:39.860]  Is your kid still a night owl?
[47:39.860 --> 47:40.860]  Yeah.
[47:40.860 --> 47:41.860]  He is.
[47:41.860 --> 47:43.780]  He's a natural born.
[47:43.780 --> 47:50.620]  And as soon as Saturday hits, you know, school starts at 8 a.m. Monday, Tuesday, you know,
[47:50.620 --> 47:51.620]  right through Friday.
[47:51.620 --> 47:53.940]  And then as soon as Saturday comes, he sleeps until noon.
[47:53.940 --> 47:55.940]  No kidding.
[47:55.940 --> 47:56.940]  Wow.
[47:56.940 --> 47:59.620]  Man, I hate that daylight savings time.
[47:59.620 --> 48:02.860]  I hate to jump on this bandwagon, but man, I'm so relieved when that ends.
[48:02.860 --> 48:05.740]  It makes our life so much easier.
[48:05.740 --> 48:06.740]  I couldn't disagree more.
[48:06.740 --> 48:09.700]  No, you don't like the savings time.
[48:09.700 --> 48:11.300]  I don't like that.
[48:11.300 --> 48:13.180]  It's like it's Trump.
[48:13.180 --> 48:18.100]  It's very hard to get my kid to go to sleep when it's like even 830 and it's still light
[48:18.100 --> 48:19.100]  outside.
[48:19.100 --> 48:20.300]  Now you're saying you're pro daylight savings time.
[48:20.300 --> 48:22.600]  You like the extra daylight at night.
[48:22.600 --> 48:23.600]  I do.
[48:23.600 --> 48:24.600]  Hold on.
[48:24.600 --> 48:26.420]  But let's I mean, it's thank a sponsor and we'll go with it because that was the whole
[48:26.420 --> 48:27.660]  thing I wanted to talk about.
[48:27.660 --> 48:29.100]  I'd love to go head to head on this.
[48:29.100 --> 48:31.900]  I think this is something America needs to hear.
[48:31.900 --> 48:34.520]  People have very strong feelings about this job.
[48:34.520 --> 48:40.140]  Our second sponsor is our good friends at Warby Parker and you guys know Warby Parker.
[48:40.140 --> 48:47.300]  That's the independent eyeglass eyewear company that was founded simply on the basis that
[48:47.300 --> 48:51.740]  buying eyeglasses should not cost an arm and a leg.
[48:51.740 --> 48:55.700]  I shouldn't have to pay 300 bucks just for a regular pair of glasses and like we were
[48:55.700 --> 48:59.560]  talking about with the Levi's before, you ought to be able to buy them right there online
[48:59.560 --> 49:06.540]  and just have it be easy and not have to go into a stupid store and waste a whole day.
[49:06.540 --> 49:09.180]  Warby Parker, if you haven't heard, what you do is you go to their website.
[49:09.180 --> 49:11.460]  They have a whole bunch of glasses to choose from.
[49:11.460 --> 49:13.380]  You pick a bunch that you like.
[49:13.380 --> 49:14.840]  Pick different ones.
[49:14.840 --> 49:19.240]  Then they send them to your house for free, just empty without any kind of prescription
[49:19.240 --> 49:24.320]  lens in them or whatever and you can try them on, see if you like them, see if there's something
[49:24.320 --> 49:29.500]  stupid on the sides that you didn't notice when you were looking at them straight on.
[49:29.500 --> 49:30.500]  You know what I mean?
[49:30.500 --> 49:31.500]  It's like you can't –
[49:31.500 --> 49:32.500]  You're making fun of me.
[49:32.500 --> 49:33.500]  No, I'm saying –
[49:33.500 --> 49:34.500]  For my sneaky petes.
[49:34.500 --> 49:37.180]  I loved your sneaky petes.
[49:37.180 --> 49:40.880]  But I'm saying I'm the type of person where I would ordinarily think I'm never going to
[49:40.880 --> 49:44.020]  buy eyeglasses online because I have to see them in person.
[49:44.020 --> 49:46.700]  I cannot judge this just by pictures.
[49:46.700 --> 49:48.100]  You don't have to do that.
[49:48.100 --> 49:52.140]  You judge them online looking at the pictures just to have them sent to your house.
[49:52.140 --> 49:57.340]  Then you get five of them and you can actually sit there and examine them in your own hands.
[49:57.340 --> 50:02.500]  You pick the one that you like and then boom, a couple of days later, in they come with
[50:02.500 --> 50:07.320]  your prescription lenses in place.
[50:07.320 --> 50:12.320]  They also – They do a great, great thing and here's the thing.
[50:12.320 --> 50:14.120]  They start at just 95 bucks.
[50:14.120 --> 50:18.460]  You go to warbyparker.com and they start at 95 bucks.
[50:18.460 --> 50:20.140]  They have showrooms in some cities.
[50:20.140 --> 50:21.140]  I think New York has it.
[50:21.140 --> 50:22.380]  Does San Francisco have one?
[50:22.380 --> 50:23.380]  I don't know.
[50:23.380 --> 50:24.380]  I don't know of that.
[50:24.380 --> 50:28.620]  I've done the home try on several times and it's amazing.
[50:28.620 --> 50:29.620]  Home try on is the way to go.
[50:29.620 --> 50:30.620]  You should never know.
[50:30.620 --> 50:31.620]  That's the thing.
[50:31.620 --> 50:33.420]  I remember one time a million years ago, I went to – Well, I won't say the name but
[50:33.420 --> 50:36.940]  it was a site where you could go and like upload a picture of yourself and try the glasses
[50:36.940 --> 50:40.220]  on online and then I got the glasses and they're like clown glasses.
[50:40.220 --> 50:45.340]  I had no idea of the actual like – You can't tell until you put them on your actual stupid
[50:45.340 --> 50:46.340]  face.
[50:46.340 --> 50:47.340]  Right.
[50:47.340 --> 50:48.420]  There's just no way.
[50:48.420 --> 50:51.120]  So here's the other thing though.
[50:51.120 --> 50:56.860]  For every pair of glasses that they sell, they distribute a pair to someone in need
[50:56.860 --> 50:57.860]  around the world.
[50:57.860 --> 50:59.340]  They've partnered with non-profits.
[50:59.340 --> 51:05.420]  There's one called VisionSpring but that's 15 percent of the world population.
[51:05.420 --> 51:11.260]  A billion people around the world lack access to prescription glasses.
[51:11.260 --> 51:17.300]  So if anybody out there who has bad vision – My uncorrected vision is at this point
[51:17.300 --> 51:19.020]  in my life absolutely horrible.
[51:19.020 --> 51:22.860]  I would be – I don't even know if I could cross the street.
[51:22.860 --> 51:27.020]  If you think about what that would be like not to have glasses, I mean I don't know
[51:27.020 --> 51:28.460]  how I would even function.
[51:28.460 --> 51:32.940]  I mean the only thing I can see about six inches in front of my face uncorrected.
[51:32.940 --> 51:36.260]  So think about the fact that there's a billion people worldwide who don't have access to
[51:36.260 --> 51:40.540]  glasses and like if you were a kid, how you couldn't even see – How are you going
[51:40.540 --> 51:41.540]  to learn anything?
[51:41.540 --> 51:43.080]  So they're doing a great thing.
[51:43.080 --> 51:46.780]  Every time they sell a pair of glasses, they send one to people in need.
[51:46.780 --> 51:48.220]  I think that's a huge part of it.
[51:48.220 --> 51:50.300]  And it doesn't mean – The prices aren't jacked up.
[51:50.300 --> 51:51.500]  It's not like you're paying double.
[51:51.500 --> 51:58.400]  You're paying less than you would pay at a typical eyeglass place.
[51:58.400 --> 52:01.540]  All of their glasses include anti-reflective, anti-glare coating.
[52:01.540 --> 52:04.680]  There's no additional cost for that, no upsell and stuff like that.
[52:04.680 --> 52:09.860]  Everything comes with a really nice case, cleaning cloth, everything you want, stuff
[52:09.860 --> 52:10.860]  like that.
[52:10.860 --> 52:11.860]  Really cool kit.
[52:11.860 --> 52:12.860]  It's great stuff.
[52:12.860 --> 52:13.860]  I don't know.
[52:13.860 --> 52:17.780]  I've lost track now of how many Warby Parker glasses we've got here in the Gruber household.
[52:17.780 --> 52:22.620]  Sunglasses, everything you might want.
[52:22.620 --> 52:23.620]  And here's the thing.
[52:23.620 --> 52:24.620]  This is new.
[52:24.620 --> 52:25.620]  They've got progressive.
[52:25.620 --> 52:26.620]  I think it's new.
[52:26.620 --> 52:29.780]  Progressive lenses starting at $295 including the frames.
[52:29.780 --> 52:34.700]  Now, progressives – This is for my demographic now.
[52:34.700 --> 52:40.300]  That's where you have a distant prescription at the top of the lens and a transition to
[52:40.300 --> 52:43.420]  a reading lens near the lens's bottom.
[52:43.420 --> 52:47.020]  And there's not like a hard line in between them that says bifocal.
[52:47.020 --> 52:48.020]  It's just – I don't know.
[52:48.020 --> 52:49.660]  I don't know how they do it.
[52:49.660 --> 52:56.220]  They call it a digital freeform lens which is the most advanced progressive technology.
[52:56.220 --> 53:00.120]  It's applied digitally with a computer so the design is more precise than traditional
[53:00.120 --> 53:01.820]  models of progressives.
[53:01.820 --> 53:05.700]  So they've got that.
[53:05.700 --> 53:08.020]  That's where I'm at in my life with the glasses.
[53:08.020 --> 53:11.540]  So anyway, here's where you go to find out more.
[53:11.540 --> 53:16.100]  Go to warbyparker.com slash the talk show.
[53:16.100 --> 53:21.860]  WarbyParker.com slash the talk show and my thanks to them.
[53:21.860 --> 53:26.900]  If you need glasses or you need sunglasses, just go check them out because you get – and
[53:26.900 --> 53:27.900]  what are they going to do here?
[53:27.900 --> 53:32.820]  They're – use that URL and you get free three-day shipping with your lenses.
[53:32.820 --> 53:34.820]  So why not?
[53:34.820 --> 53:36.820]  All right.
[53:36.820 --> 53:37.820]  Daylight savings time.
[53:37.820 --> 53:38.820]  So you don't –
[53:38.820 --> 53:39.820]  Just do a quick check in.
[53:39.820 --> 53:40.820]  Have you checked on your cable?
[53:40.820 --> 53:41.820]  Just to see.
[53:41.820 --> 53:44.820]  I'm just curious if that guy ever fixed the cone.
[53:44.820 --> 53:50.980]  Hold on, let me see.
[53:50.980 --> 53:54.300]  If this actually works, it's going to be mind-blowing.
[53:54.300 --> 53:56.820]  I didn't get a text from him so I'm not –
[53:56.820 --> 54:00.900]  It's a one-time text so you're only going to get it if you're plugged in.
[54:00.900 --> 54:01.900]  You know what though?
[54:01.900 --> 54:07.900]  No, I'm on this – I was smart enough not to do it on the machine where I was recording
[54:07.900 --> 54:09.820]  our call on.
[54:09.820 --> 54:12.820]  But it looks like it is working.
[54:12.820 --> 54:13.820]  Yeah.
[54:13.820 --> 54:15.540]  Hey, Mazel Tov.
[54:15.540 --> 54:17.600]  No text from him though.
[54:17.600 --> 54:18.600]  Maybe they're not.
[54:18.600 --> 54:19.600]  Maybe they're not.
[54:19.600 --> 54:20.600]  You want to keep slugging along this way?
[54:20.600 --> 54:21.600]  Yeah.
[54:21.600 --> 54:22.600]  Well, we can keep going.
[54:22.600 --> 54:23.600]  Yeah.
[54:23.600 --> 54:26.820]  I mean, I can't – I say if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[54:26.820 --> 54:31.140]  If the cone falls over and it's not hurting anybody, just leave it there.
[54:31.140 --> 54:32.140]  Yeah.
[54:32.140 --> 54:35.220]  What if that dog ever catches that cat?
[54:35.220 --> 54:38.380]  All right.
[54:38.380 --> 54:43.200]  So daylight savings time.
[54:43.200 --> 54:50.820]  So you're opposed to it because of the summer months where it packs the daylight at – I
[54:50.820 --> 54:53.740]  see – I feel like we've got the whole thing backwards.
[54:53.740 --> 54:59.900]  I feel like I could totally get behind – because it's not even like a six-month, six-month
[54:59.900 --> 55:00.900]  thing anymore.
[55:00.900 --> 55:01.900]  I thought it used to be.
[55:01.900 --> 55:02.900]  I know they're always –
[55:02.900 --> 55:03.900]  They changed everything around.
[55:03.900 --> 55:05.680]  It's real confusing.
[55:05.680 --> 55:07.260]  It's very confusing and I don't think it's the same.
[55:07.260 --> 55:09.380]  It starts later and ends later.
[55:09.380 --> 55:15.460]  Now, I know they changed it I believe so that it ends after Halloween on purpose to make
[55:15.460 --> 55:17.460]  it safer for kids which is great.
[55:17.460 --> 55:19.580]  But then I think it starts later too.
[55:19.580 --> 55:20.580]  Is that right?
[55:20.580 --> 55:22.580]  I don't know.
[55:22.580 --> 55:28.020]  I'm not quite sure about that.
[55:28.020 --> 55:33.180]  But the fact is though that there's more of the year that's daylight savings time than
[55:33.180 --> 55:35.300]  there is that standard time, right?
[55:35.300 --> 55:36.300]  Oh, no.
[55:36.300 --> 55:37.300]  I'm sorry.
[55:37.300 --> 55:38.300]  I take it back.
[55:38.300 --> 55:39.300]  They moved it back.
[55:39.300 --> 55:43.620]  So the next one, 2014, it started March 9th, ends November 2nd.
[55:43.620 --> 55:44.620]  Wow.
[55:44.620 --> 55:45.620]  You're totally right December.
[55:45.620 --> 55:46.620]  Wow.
[55:46.620 --> 55:47.620]  Right?
[55:47.620 --> 55:52.300]  So it's really just – it's just November, December, January, February.
[55:52.300 --> 55:53.300]  So what?
[55:53.300 --> 55:54.300]  Yeah.
[55:54.300 --> 55:56.300]  Three quarters of the year or something like that?
[55:56.300 --> 55:57.300]  Yeah.
[55:57.300 --> 55:58.300]  Yeah.
[55:58.300 --> 55:59.300]  Maybe it's like a one-third, two-third type thing.
[55:59.300 --> 56:00.300]  No.
[56:00.300 --> 56:01.300]  I think you're right four months.
[56:01.300 --> 56:02.300]  Yeah.
[56:02.300 --> 56:03.300]  You're right.
[56:03.300 --> 56:06.500]  I can't help but think that to me if they're going to do something like that, it's backwards
[56:06.500 --> 56:14.500]  because it's – I'm amenable to the argument that when it's 845 p.m., 845 and you're trying
[56:14.500 --> 56:20.420]  to put your kid to bed and it's enough daylight where you could be outside playing ball, that's
[56:20.420 --> 56:21.860]  a tough sell, right?
[56:21.860 --> 56:26.300]  Because now you feel like you're almost lying to your kid.
[56:26.300 --> 56:27.900]  How can you say it's bedtime?
[56:27.900 --> 56:28.900]  You know that it is.
[56:28.900 --> 56:30.140]  It does seem dishonest.
[56:30.140 --> 56:31.140]  Right.
[56:31.140 --> 56:36.220]  It's like you're saying it's bedtime and your kid hopefully – hopefully your kid
[56:36.220 --> 56:41.500]  has a window in their bedroom and they can look and see that it's daylight.
[56:41.500 --> 56:42.500]  I understand.
[56:42.500 --> 56:43.500]  That's a hard sell.
[56:43.500 --> 56:48.780]  But those are the months where I wouldn't be opposed to rejiggering it like in the – around
[56:48.780 --> 56:53.660]  June, circle four months around June where it's longest and take an hour of daylight
[56:53.660 --> 56:54.780]  there.
[56:54.780 --> 57:00.620]  My problem is I just get so – I don't want to throw the word depressed around because
[57:00.620 --> 57:02.800]  I don't have like a clinical depression.
[57:02.800 --> 57:03.800]  But I do suffer …
[57:03.800 --> 57:04.800]  Maybe you get a little blue.
[57:04.800 --> 57:08.220]  I get – I would call it like a melancholy.
[57:08.220 --> 57:14.140]  Like this need right now, like today, I feel a little melancholy just because it's – right
[57:14.140 --> 57:16.260]  now it's a rainy day here in Philadelphia.
[57:16.260 --> 57:21.460]  That's probably why my cable went out.
[57:21.460 --> 57:26.980]  Comcast doesn't really hold up too much in the wet weather.
[57:26.980 --> 57:29.340]  That's a lot to ask of hardware, John.
[57:29.340 --> 57:30.340]  You know that's true though.
[57:30.340 --> 57:33.620]  You remember because back when I did the show with Dan, it really was the case.
[57:33.620 --> 57:37.660]  This was before the guy pulled out that rusty Y thing, you know, Y splitter.
[57:37.660 --> 57:38.660]  No, it's true.
[57:38.660 --> 57:42.620]  We're on rainy days when Dan and I would record the show years ago.
[57:42.620 --> 57:46.500]  He would always – he could tell because it was like my – it was like all broken
[57:46.500 --> 57:49.020]  up like the Skype audio was all busted up on a rain.
[57:49.020 --> 57:53.780]  It was very consistent that if it was raining, my connection could not handle Skype.
[57:53.780 --> 57:55.380]  That seems crazy.
[57:55.380 --> 57:59.740]  That's fixed I think but it's – but anyway, it's a rainy day here.
[57:59.740 --> 58:00.740]  I'm with you though.
[58:00.740 --> 58:02.740]  It's like my wife gets home from work and it's dark.
[58:02.740 --> 58:04.580]  And that's – you know, it's no fun for me.
[58:04.580 --> 58:06.180]  It's certainly no fun for her.
[58:06.180 --> 58:09.940]  But for people who have like an actual job, you're coming home and it's after the time
[58:09.940 --> 58:10.940]  goes back.
[58:10.940 --> 58:11.940]  Right.
[58:11.940 --> 58:12.940]  You come home and it's dark at night.
[58:12.940 --> 58:13.940]  It's totally depressing.
[58:13.940 --> 58:14.940]  Yeah.
[58:14.940 --> 58:19.580]  When I used to work many, many years ago at the Philadelphia Inquirer, it was a type of
[58:19.580 --> 58:25.060]  place, type of gig where it was – you know, you'd show up at 9 and you'd left at 5.
[58:25.060 --> 58:26.060]  Everybody left at 5.
[58:26.060 --> 58:28.180]  You know, like 4.55, everybody is putting coats on.
[58:28.180 --> 58:29.780]  It was just that type of office.
[58:29.780 --> 58:33.940]  It was nothing – in the department I worked in, there was nothing – you know, no reason
[58:33.940 --> 58:34.940]  to stay.
[58:34.940 --> 58:37.860]  And I remember leaving the one time – it was like – it must have been like the first
[58:37.860 --> 58:42.620]  weekday I guess the Monday after we set the clocks back and it was pitch black.
[58:42.620 --> 58:49.540]  It's just dark as night and as you leave work at 5, it just was very depressing I think.
[58:49.540 --> 58:52.940]  Well, let me – this is what a dummy I am.
[58:52.940 --> 58:53.940]  Let me ask you this.
[58:53.940 --> 58:57.220]  Why don't they just change – here's the thing.
[58:57.220 --> 59:02.180]  It would seem really weird if they just changed time and we said from now on like daylight
[59:02.180 --> 59:05.340]  savings time is what we're going to have all the time.
[59:05.340 --> 59:07.220]  But it sounds like that's kind of what you're advocating for.
[59:07.220 --> 59:11.580]  It's like why don't we just change time so that we just toss in an hour here, we change
[59:11.580 --> 59:14.380]  this stuff around and now we have light at night.
[59:14.380 --> 59:16.160]  That's kind of really what you're saying, right?
[59:16.160 --> 59:17.380]  That is what I'm saying.
[59:17.380 --> 59:21.520]  That makes it seem doubly crazy that we change it during the year.
[59:21.520 --> 59:22.580]  It's that going back and forth.
[59:22.580 --> 59:25.660]  So it would be nice if there was – I mean I know I can't do a lot with the rotation
[59:25.660 --> 59:27.540]  of the planet and the angles and stuff.
[59:27.540 --> 59:32.220]  But still, I mean that's the part that's weird is the changing part I think.
[59:32.220 --> 59:35.060]  I think you could make a case and I'm not a scientist, Jon.
[59:35.060 --> 59:38.220]  I think you could make a case for saying we just need to permanently do this.
[59:38.220 --> 59:40.420]  This needs to be just time now.
[59:40.420 --> 59:47.500]  And it's just – it's such a kick in the teeth I feel that when you set it back in
[59:47.500 --> 59:54.560]  the fall that – because you know the days were getting shorter as October went on anyway.
[59:54.560 --> 59:58.620]  You could kind of – you can see like, hey, man, I remember when it was still light out
[59:58.620 --> 59:59.620]  at six o'clock.
[59:59.620 --> 01:00:00.780]  I really noticed it this year.
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:02.820]  It seemed like it happened fast.
[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:03.820]  I don't know.
[01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:07.340]  It did seem like that to me too but it's – I don't know.
[01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:09.580]  When I was a kid, it seemed like I was ignorant and stuff like that.
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:14.620]  I didn't even know what time it was most of the time I guess.
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:20.640]  As an adult now though and I feel like that sudden extra hour jump of darkness at what
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:24.700]  should be a reasonable time of day, not like what most people would still call the afternoon,
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:25.700]  not the evening.
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:29.300]  It's just – it's – I don't know.
[01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:34.860]  I'd almost rather even – I would advocate switching to the daylight savings time year
[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:35.860]  round.
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:38.380]  I would just say let's just call that and set the clocks on that.
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:41.260]  I can't believe I've never heard of that before because that seems like the kind of
[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:45.820]  whack-a-doodle campaign that I would have heard about by now and it kind of makes sense.
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:46.820]  Let's just get one.
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:48.660]  Guys, here's your slogan.
[01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:49.660]  Just pick one.
[01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:51.100]  That's the slogan.
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:52.100]  It does seem though.
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:55.940]  It seems like a hard thing for them to ever get off the ground.
[01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:59.980]  So what's the downside of permanent daylight savings time because I have to tell you just
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:03.540]  in fairness, I could get behind your whack-a-doodle scheme as long as it's consistent.
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:09.220]  The hard part is like I say like in the summertime, I mean we just need an idea and I understand
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:13.380]  the light changes like I say angles, rotation but like there just has to be some idea that
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:16.940]  if I'm – I don't sound like I'm trying to do some kind of social engineering trick
[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:19.740]  on my kid to get her to go to bed at 2 p.m. or something like that.
[01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:21.700]  You just need to pick one.
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:25.860]  The downside whenever I get on my hobby horse about this, I always hear – I hear from
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:29.860]  the morning – it's the morning people is that all of a sudden now the morning people
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:34.100]  have – it's pitch black and they always try it out.
[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:37.580]  It's always – and everybody always trots out the children but then kids are waiting
[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:42.820]  for the school bus and it's pitch black at 7.15 in the morning or whatever and that's
[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:43.820]  no good.
[01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:44.820]  I don't know.
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:48.460]  But to me and it's like somebody's – I think there's like a farming angle on it
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:51.740]  but to me it's like the farmer should just get up when the sun rises.
[01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:53.540]  Don't worry about what time it is.
[01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:56.820]  I don't understand what the – why are the farmers so time constrained?
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:58.460]  Do they need to get to AA?
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:01.700]  Like why does it matter what time the sun is up?
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:03.100]  Is the grain store closing?
[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:06.580]  Like I don't understand exactly how that – you know what I'm saying?
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:10.220]  It only makes sense if there's other stuff the farmers have to do as well as work in
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:11.220]  a field.
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:13.020]  Otherwise, the clocks don't mean fuck all.
[01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:16.140]  You just go work in your goddamn field whenever you need to.
[01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:20.500]  It isn't like you look – you pull out your pocket watch and go, oh, deary me.
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:21.500]  It's four.
[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:22.500]  I better start wrapping up.
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:23.500]  No, get back to work.
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:24.500]  Farm, farm.
[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:25.500]  Yeah.
[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:26.820]  I don't know what the deal is with that.
[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:33.220]  I dig it now and just right here in my own household as I endlessly bitched about the
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:38.780]  Daylight Savings Time rollout last week, Amy even said, well, you don't take the kid to
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:39.780]  school every day.
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:40.780]  It's pitch black.
[01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:41.780]  It was pitch black last week.
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:46.220]  It's better now that we – it actually looks like morning when I'm taking him to school.
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:47.220]  So I appreciate that.
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:48.220]  I don't know.
[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:53.740]  Maybe the answer is that sometime around November, like from November through like New Year's,
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:55.700]  we should all just stay in bed.
[01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:59.940]  Well, I think the depressing lack of sunlight really supports that.
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:05.020]  I think if we all just agreed to just be a little bit more Logie, Logie our way into
[01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:06.020]  Christmas.
[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:07.020]  Yeah.
[01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:10.140]  Well, is there also an angle of energy saving?
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:12.300]  Isn't that another angle of it?
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:13.420]  Oh, definitely.
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:16.260]  I think that's – I think that was the explanation behind the –
[01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:17.740]  Like why we kept it.
[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:19.660]  And well, and why we've expanded it.
[01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:28.940]  Like why we've added – made more and more of the calendar year daylight savings is that
[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:30.660]  it – I don't know.
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:32.580]  I'm not quite sure what the argument is though.
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:34.260]  I have to be honest with you, Jon.
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:38.940]  I'm still deeply confused just about time zones alone.
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:42.180]  I was talking to Mike Hurley the other day and I was asking him whether they get Christmas
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:43.660]  in a different season than we do.
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:48.780]  I honestly don't understand anything about how any of this works and I still have to
[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:54.780]  basically mentally draw a picture to understand which time change causes what difference.
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:56.940]  My brain is just not wired to totally understand this.
[01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:00.920]  I'm bluffing my way through this a little bit but I honestly find everything involving
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.060]  time completely bizarre.
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:06.180]  Well, you know what the – China does, right?
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:07.180]  Hmm.
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:08.180]  What?
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:09.180]  What did you know?
[01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:11.860]  China does not have – they don't believe in time zones.
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:12.860]  So China is a land mass –
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:13.860]  It's kind of revolutionary.
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:18.140]  Well, it's a land mass roughly comparable to the United States.
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:21.140]  It's about – it's the same sort of shape too.
[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:24.200]  It's wider than it is tall and it's about the same width.
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:29.300]  Like if they went with time zones, they would span four time zones like the continental
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:30.780]  United States does.
[01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:31.780]  But they don't do it.
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:35.180]  They just have – the clocks are set to Chinese time and that's it.
[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:36.660]  And so if you're on the –
[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:39.380]  Well, regardless of like how far north you are because I mean that –
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:40.380]  We're not west.
[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:41.660]  It would be – no, east and west.
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:45.300]  No, but I mean also, you know, as you go higher up like in Washington, like their days are
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:46.300]  really short.
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:47.300]  You know what I mean?
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:48.300]  As you go further up –
[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:49.300]  Oh, right, right.
[01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:50.300]  The days are shorter.
[01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:51.300]  Yeah.
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:52.300]  Yeah.
[01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:53.860]  And like people in Florida get a little bit more – a little bit more sunshine.
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:55.720]  It's all completely perplexing.
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:59.780]  If somebody told me that this is one of those Capricorn 1 situations and the whole time
[01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:02.380]  thing was a bluff, I would have no trouble believing it.
[01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:03.900]  I find it all completely perplexing.
[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:06.740]  No, but it's like totally serious.
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:07.740]  We're like –
[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:08.740]  So they have one time in China.
[01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:09.740]  It's just Chinese time.
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:10.740]  That's it.
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:14.980]  And I think it's optimized for their east coast because that's where all the big cities
[01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:15.980]  are.
[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:16.980]  Wow.
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:21.660]  And – but if you live in the western side of China, the sun doesn't even come up until
[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:27.140]  like 11 a.m. and you just – they just sit there, live their lives accordingly.
[01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.140]  Like maybe – I don't know.
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:29.700]  Maybe school doesn't start till 11 over there.
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:32.960]  I feel like I've seen like three different documentaries in the last year that lead me
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:38.140]  to believe that the whole modern concept of time and being on a certain time comes out
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:39.140]  of the railroad schedules.
[01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:40.140]  Is that right?
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:41.140]  Is that where that comes from?
[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:42.140]  I believe it.
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:43.140]  Yeah.
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:44.140]  Could be.
[01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.300]  Yeah, because I guess there was a time when like each train company had their own time
[01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:46.300]  that they kept.
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:47.300]  And it became very important.
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:49.300]  Obviously, if you're changing trains, that all has got to work together.
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:50.300]  I don't know.
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:52.500]  Yeah, but it's nice though.
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.120]  See, there is a certain appeal to that.
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:06:01.280]  So it's like in China, it depends where you live if you think of what is a good bedtime
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:02.280]  for a child.
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:06.060]  It might be off by three hours depending on if you're in the east or the west.
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:13.340]  But if you tell somebody, we will have this conference call at 2 o'clock in the afternoon,
[01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:15.680]  everybody knows it's at the right time.
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:16.680]  I think that's very appealing.
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:20.700]  That's why I mean like if I could ever get my brain around it going to pure GMT, I find
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:21.700]  something very appealing about that.
[01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:23.140]  Like it's always this certain time.
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:25.020]  Like that's the one we all refer to.
[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:28.700]  I mean even just trying to schedule stuff with people in this, increasingly, it's
[01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:32.720]  this central time zone that really screws me up because it's just enough off from the
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:36.340]  two main areas that it completely screws with my head.
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:38.260]  Yeah, I'm not good with that either.
[01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:39.260]  And you know what?
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:40.260]  You're right.
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:41.260]  The central time is worse.
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:46.260]  So I did the layer tennis commentary two weeks ago, must have been two weeks ago, it wasn't
[01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:47.860]  last week.
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:51.020]  And that all runs on Chicago time.
[01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:53.340]  And it's good for me.
[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:54.940]  I was ready an hour early.
[01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:59.420]  That's the funny part is I'm on the West Coast here on the East Coast and the East Coast
[01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:01.180]  wins always.
[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:02.520]  Eastern time is the winner.
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:06.920]  It's the canonical time in America and everybody else just has to like do the math.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.860]  Central is the only time zone where I periodically go the wrong way.
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:14.460]  Like I know you guys are three hours later than us, but for some reason, sometimes when
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:18.220]  I'm doing the mental math, I get the central time zone wrong.
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:22.220]  So I'm basically putting them in the Pacific Ocean sometimes.
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:23.420]  Yeah and I don't know.
[01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:25.020]  It just doesn't seem...
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:26.020]  Remember the timeline.
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:29.540]  Do you understand the international, what's it called?
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:30.540]  International Dateline?
[01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:31.540]  No.
[01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:32.540]  Do you understand that?
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:33.540]  No.
[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:37.220]  If I make diagrams and draw, I can somehow guess.
[01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:38.860]  We went to New Zealand.
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:42.260]  It still makes no sense to me that, well, you guys had a crazy flight because you had
[01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:46.260]  to get all the way over to here before you could even have the terrible flight we had.
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:48.340]  But it was like a 15 hour flight.
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:51.240]  But I remember arriving in New Zealand and we felt pretty good.
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:53.620]  My wife had some nausea from traveling.
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:54.620]  But I was cock of the walk.
[01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:55.620]  I felt fine.
[01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:59.140]  Coming back from New Zealand, I was out for three weeks.
[01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:00.140]  If I found that...
[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:01.140]  How is that possible?
[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:02.140]  I don't know.
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:04.140]  I found that to be worse too.
[01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:07.260]  Getting back from New Zealand just felt like...
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:08.260]  I felt like I had mono.
[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:09.260]  I mean it was...
[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:12.100]  I felt like I was drugged.
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:14.940]  You know Michael Opp lost a birthday.
[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:17.260]  Oh no.
[01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.260]  Maybe this was not the year.
[01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.260]  It was the second time.
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:20.260]  Probably later.
[01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:21.260]  It didn't go.
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.260]  Yeah.
[01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:23.740]  It was the second time I spoke at Webstock.
[01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:29.740]  And Michael Opp got on an airplane in SFO the day before his birthday.
[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:35.780]  And when he stepped off the plane in Auckland, it was the day after his birthday.
[01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:36.780]  That makes no sense.
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:37.780]  I swear to God.
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:38.780]  That's so weird.
[01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:43.020]  And you know what it's like to be like a leap year baby.
[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:44.020]  Yeah.
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:48.260]  And I, you know, he's a big boy.
[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:49.300]  It wasn't sad about it.
[01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:53.060]  But like I told Jonas and Jonas was just blown away.
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:56.820]  I mean like a nine-year-old kid, like to think that you lost your birthday because you're
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:57.820]  a...
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:08:58.820]  That's really unjust.
[01:08:58.820 --> 01:08:59.820]  Yeah.
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:00.820]  And he...
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:02.620]  Like that was like the thing like when he went back to school because Jonas came with
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:03.620]  us again.
[01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:04.620]  And then it was like, well, you know, what'd you do?
[01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:05.780]  It was like you went to New Zealand.
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:06.780]  It's like, wow.
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:07.780]  That's awesome.
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:08.780]  What happened?
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:11.780]  And then his story was my dad's friend lost a birthday and he like explained it.
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:14.460]  And all of his friends were like, that's outrageous.
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:16.620]  That's the saddest story I've ever heard.
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:23.460]  If there's anything that can make kids unionize, like missing out, missing out a gift giving
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:24.460]  holiday.
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:25.460]  Right.
[01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:26.460]  It just, it does.
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:27.620]  It confuses me how that could happen.
[01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:31.180]  It just seems like it should be a different time.
[01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:32.180]  What was he for?
[01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:34.420]  What was he for Halloween this year?
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:37.940]  Oh, Sherlock Holmes.
[01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:38.940]  Oh, wow.
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:41.180]  I mean with that, with the hat and everything.
[01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:42.180]  Yeah.
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:43.260]  Well, there's only really one way to do it.
[01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:44.260]  You kind of have to go...
[01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:46.260]  She's going to go Cumberbatch.
[01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:47.260]  Yeah.
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:48.660]  But I don't know that that's a...
[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:49.660]  That's not canonical.
[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:50.660]  Yeah.
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:52.580]  It's like, it's not recognizable.
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:57.420]  You're not going to, you kind of got to go, I don't know what that hat's called, but...
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:58.420]  Yeah.
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:09:59.420]  The Sherlock Holmes hat.
[01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:00.420]  Right.
[01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:01.420]  That's cool.
[01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:02.880]  What, so does he read it or like movies?
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.820]  Like how did he get into Sherlock Holmes?
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:11.180]  He's into the, he's into the, the new movies, the Robert Downey Jr ones.
[01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:12.180]  All right.
[01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:13.180]  Enjoyed those very much.
[01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:17.380]  Are those, are those kind of swashbuckling?
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:18.380]  Yeah.
[01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:20.660]  There's, yeah, especially the second one.
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:24.740]  The second one's a little, it's, it's, you know, a little Indiana Jonesy.
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:28.820]  It's not, it's not a very into like, you know, there's some of that, but it's, it's a more
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:30.940]  action oriented Sherlock Holmes.
[01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:31.940]  Nice.
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:34.260]  That's a good one.
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:38.180]  My kid was a Hermione Granger from Harry Potter.
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:39.600]  I saw the picture.
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:41.980]  She was a dead ringer.
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:43.700]  She kind of nailed it, I think.
[01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:44.700]  Yeah.
[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:45.700]  Yeah.
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:46.700]  That's good.
[01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:48.980]  It's, it's, you know, but this is a, it was nice cause the last couple of years before
[01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:53.500]  that, we'd done a Marvel related, you know, costume superheroes.
[01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.900]  So I thought this was a nice change.
[01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:56.900]  Yeah.
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:00.000]  Jonas, Amy, Amy knocks it out with the, the, the costume.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.120]  Look at that photo.
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:02.120]  Look at that guy.
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.120]  Yeah.
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.260]  It's got a little pipe in his hand.
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:05.260]  It's got the magnifying glass.
[01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:06.260]  Oh my God.
[01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:07.260]  That's so great.
[01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:08.260]  I love his cloak.
[01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:09.260]  Yeah.
[01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:10.260]  Yeah.
[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:11.260]  Good stuff.
[01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:12.260]  Yeah.
[01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:13.260]  This is all that stuff on the internet.
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:14.980]  She kind of runs that joint, doesn't she?
[01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:15.980]  Yeah.
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:16.980]  Yeah.
[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:17.980]  I mean, same here.
[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:18.980]  Same here.
[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:19.980]  He's getting old.
[01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:22.020]  I mean, he's 10, so he's, I think he's running out, but he's done, he's done just about all
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:23.020]  the big ones.
[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:25.140]  He's done, uh, trying to think he's done Buzz Lightyear.
[01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:32.060]  That was really young Buzz Lightyear, uh, Han Solo, Indiana Jones, the, uh, my, my favorite
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:34.420]  was the Clint Eastwood man with no name.
[01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:35.420]  Oh, that was great.
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:37.980]  I remember that his Indiana Jones was really good too.
[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:38.980]  I remember that one.
[01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:42.740]  Uh, trying to remember what else is in there.
[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:44.300]  Oh, Dr. Who.
[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:45.700]  He did Dr. Who last year.
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:47.740]  Oh, he's like, uh, Matt Smith.
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:48.740]  Yeah.
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:49.740]  Oh, that's awesome.
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:50.740]  Yeah.
[01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:51.740]  That was a good one.
[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:52.740]  Yeah.
[01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:55.020]  He's kind of my canary in a coal mine for what's happening in the world.
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:59.300]  When I hear you talking about like Minecraft and YouTube and stuff like that, I feel like
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:02.620]  I'm learning a lot about what's coming up through you and him.
[01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:03.620]  Yeah.
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:08.340]  I'm looking, you know, Moltz wrote a YouTube book, not a YouTube book, a Minecraft book.
[01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:09.340]  Really?
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:10.340]  Yeah.
[01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:11.340]  Wow.
[01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:12.340]  That's cool.
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:13.340]  It's coming out.
[01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:14.340]  It's coming out.
[01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:15.340]  It might be coming out tomorrow.
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:16.340]  Oh, that's awesome.
[01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:19.580]  I can't wait to read it because I got to tell you, I, this Minecraft thing, I still don't
[01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:20.580]  get it.
[01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:21.580]  Terrified by it.
[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:22.580]  I'm utterly terrified.
[01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:27.700]  We went to Scott Simpson's birthday party over the summer and it was her first exposure
[01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:31.020]  to Minecraft on a screen because I've, I've, yeah, let's be honest, I've kept her away
[01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:36.300]  from it because everything I've heard from everybody, you know me, right?
[01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:37.300]  Like I'm not that guy.
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:39.060]  Like she can play with, she can do stuff on the iPad.
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:44.060]  I'm not like, we're not crazy about that kind of stuff, but every to a person, every mom
[01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:47.620]  and dad says the same thing, which is there's the life that I had with my kid before Minecraft
[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:52.740]  and the life after it'll probably be fine, but I, she's seven.
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:56.580]  I'm enjoying these days and I, I I'm, so I'm circumspect.
[01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:58.820]  It's pretty immersive though, huh?
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:12:59.820]  It can be.
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:04.060]  It certainly, you know, it, the best I can get it.
[01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:10.340]  I really can't wait to read Molt's book cause I really, it's like nothing else that I've
[01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:11.340]  ever seen before.
[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:14.820]  There is a way that you can play it like a video game where you're running around and
[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:19.340]  there's these creepers that are like zombies that you have to avoid and you need to build
[01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:24.660]  shelter for the nighttime, but that's not really, that's not what kids are doing.
[01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:25.660]  It really is.
[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:26.660]  It's more like Lego, right?
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:27.660]  Yeah.
[01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:28.660]  It's more like virtual Lego.
[01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:31.420]  Like the Lego company sort of should have bought Minecraft.
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:34.980]  Like it's crazy that Microsoft, either them or Disney, Disney, I can't believe Disney
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:37.820]  didn't buy them because I think, I really think it's got staying power.
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:44.820]  There were so many kids in homemade Minecraft costumes for Halloween, but it was a very
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:45.820]  inefficient.
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:49.260]  It was mostly, you'd see a kid with a blocky kind of tunic and then holding up the box
[01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:52.700]  that should have been on their head cause they can't see a damn thing, but they were,
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:55.820]  they were blocking McMinecraft or whatever his name is.
[01:13:55.820 --> 01:14:03.700]  I'm trying to, it's mostly about the building, the collaboration, you, yeah, the game itself
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:08.020]  and forgive me cause I've never played it, but so basically you start out in this world
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.020]  and you got to stay alive.
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:12.580]  You got to build stuff you have to mine and then that enables you to get things and then
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:16.980]  you make comp combinations of different things, make other things.
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:18.100]  That's kind of the idea.
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:19.100]  Yeah.
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:23.940]  And it's like you, you dig to get raw materials and then you can turn the raw materials into
[01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:28.900]  things and the whole game is super hackable.
[01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:33.820]  Like you just unzip a jar file and there's all, you know, it's like going into it like
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:38.220]  in Mac terms, like opening up the application package and you can go in there and change
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:39.220]  all the stuff out.
[01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:41.380]  It's like rez edit for pixels.
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:43.580]  Yeah, it very much so.
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:48.840]  It's exactly like the way we hacked our stuff with rez edit 20 years ago.
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:53.860]  That's what the kids are doing with the Minecraft extensions and mod packs and stuff like that.
[01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:58.900]  Um, but yeah, and it's like, and they play, you know, and this is the part where it starts
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:02.380]  to get like, Hey, what the hell is, I got to, I kind of have to step in here as a parent,
[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:07.700]  like make sure this is all right is when they collaborate on a server and, and it's all
[01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:08.700]  open.
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:09.700]  This is the thing.
[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:12.340]  Can't you get like your own, I was seeing the penny arcade guys were talking about this.
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:14.180]  Like you can get like a private server, right?
[01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:15.180]  If you choose to.
[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:16.180]  Absolutely.
[01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:17.180]  No.
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:19.740]  And that's really like as a responsible parent, it's like you kind of, you know, you kind
[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:23.380]  of have to limit it to private servers, you know, it's like you can't just go and play
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:27.700]  on the servers where people are, you know, you know, it could be anybody.
[01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:32.460]  It's like, you know, so he's got one, um, you know, I think it's cheap, I don't know.
[01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:34.500]  It's like $3 a month or something like that.
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:36.220]  But Jonas has his own server.
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:40.500]  Um, it's like, you know, like getting a web hosting account costs like three, three bucks
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:41.500]  a month.
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:45.220]  And, but then him and his friends, he just gives an address to his friends and him and
[01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:47.260]  his friends from school can play together.
[01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:51.460]  And it's just like the six of them and they get, it's like a private room.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:52.460]  Yeah.
[01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:53.460]  You know?
[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:54.460]  And they build stuff together.
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:55.460]  It's crazy.
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:59.740]  Like he showed me like him and one of his pals from school built like a place for their characters
[01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:03.460]  to live, like a skyscraper, you know, with like a, you know, pretty cool.
[01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:09.900]  It was pretty cool pad really, uh, like way up high though, like massive, massive building.
[01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:10.900]  Really pretty cool.
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:12.900]  That sounds like a lot of fun.
[01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:13.900]  I don't know.
[01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:16.400]  I, um, it's very free form.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.400]  That's the thing.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.540]  It sounds very creative and collaborative.
[01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:20.540]  Yeah.
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:24.860]  And the thing is, is that the company behind it, it's, it's really genius and it is sort
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:30.420]  of a triumph of openness where, you know, like I said, the game is hackable.
[01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:37.560]  Um, but if you want to play online, it's not like you have to play with the official Minecraft
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:41.900]  online server and you have to pay for it or whatever.
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:43.820]  Anybody like can run their own Minecraft server.
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:47.820]  It's all just, you know, you know, like the game is, is commercially, you have to pay
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:48.820]  for the game.
[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:49.820]  You know, I'm sure.
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:50.820]  Yeah.
[01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:51.820]  You do.
[01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:52.820]  You license a copy, like a seat.
[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:55.100]  Uh, I don't know what we pay.
[01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:57.220]  This has got to be so boring for people.
[01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:59.700]  It's just like, let me understand this.
[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:00.700]  Television has channels.
[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:01.700]  How does that work?
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:02.700]  You have to pay to ha ha.
[01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:03.980]  How do you change them?
[01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:04.980]  Right.
[01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:08.500]  But like the, the iPad app is like 6 99 and that I played on an iPad.
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:09.500]  Wow.
[01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:10.500]  Okay.
[01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:11.500]  Yeah.
[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:12.500]  But it's weird though.
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:13.500]  The iPad one is weird.
[01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:14.500]  Like it's really, it's like solo.
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:17.580]  Like you can't, you can't play the iPad one on the safe.
[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:18.580]  It's Java.
[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:19.580]  Yeah.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:22.540]  And then they made the iPad one since the whole thing's written in Java.
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:25.940]  But anyway, you play on a computer and you can connect to any server and anybody can
[01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:26.940]  run a server.
[01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:31.540]  And so there's public servers where there are thousands of people running around and
[01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:36.420]  you can just set up your own server anywhere you want and have just you and you know, your
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:42.660]  two pals and you know, it's nice and peaceful and quiet, but you can chat, you know, while
[01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:43.660]  you're on the server.
[01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:48.100]  And that's where, you know, there's some parenting that needs to come in, like it needs to, you
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:52.180]  know, can't just be, how do you, how do you, if you do, do you, how do you limit access
[01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:53.180]  to that?
[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:56.260]  You got hours for that or yeah, they got, it's gotta be like, you know, certain time
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:18:00.240]  and you got to, you know, make sure your homework's done first and uh, geez, my kids in fricking
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.300]  first grade.
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:04.180]  And by the time we pick her up from after school and she does her homework, like we've
[01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:06.540]  got, I feel like we've got like an hour before bedtime.
[01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:09.980]  So maybe, maybe the thing here is to just, uh, is to turbo like you guys do and just
[01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:11.940]  push, push bed down to like 1130.
[01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:14.900]  Well, you can't do that on a school night.
[01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:15.900]  Jesus.
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.540]  Well, you know, she'll figure it out.
[01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:18.540]  She could nap.
[01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:19.540]  She could nap during recess or something.
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:25.380]  I guess I have to admit as a parent, I do feel like, um, Jonas's school seems pretty
[01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:26.500]  good on homework.
[01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:31.260]  They don't, he seems to get a lot less than a lot of kids seem to now nationally.
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:33.340]  Are you guys a common core state?
[01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:38.020]  No, I don't even, I, no, I don't think we are.
[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:43.300]  Um, it just seems to me I, as a parent, I have the exact same perspective on it that
[01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:46.700]  I had when I was actually in school, which is, this is bullshit.
[01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:49.260]  I've been, I, I, you had me all day.
[01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:50.260]  Right.
[01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:51.260]  Right.
[01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:52.260]  Like that's a long day.
[01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:56.740]  Like 8am til three in the afternoon is an awful lot of chunk of your time.
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:19:00.300]  Uh, why is there more work to be done?
[01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:02.180]  I don't, I've never, I never understood that.
[01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:03.180]  It feels like a hack.
[01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:07.540]  It feels like a behavioral hack because like with my kids, she brings home like worksheets
[01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:09.740]  like right now she's doing fractions.
[01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:14.060]  And so it's a lot of like show, you know, two fourths show, three eighths, you know,
[01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:15.780]  by filling in these pie pieces.
[01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:20.300]  And it, it really seems like, and this is not bad, but it is what she did at school.
[01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:23.860]  It's just, they want her to do more of it at home, which to my mind, like I get the
[01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:28.100]  idea of the repetition and practice, even the kind of, you know, primacy and recency
[01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:29.460]  thing of trying it in different places.
[01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:33.940]  I can get all of that, but this is one of those few legacy things that feels like something
[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:37.760]  from our childhood where really legitimately school was about teaching you to follow rules
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:40.780]  and it was about teaching you to like habituate yourself to certain kinds.
[01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:41.780]  You know what I mean?
[01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:46.300]  Like that has changed so much from when we were kids.
[01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:48.860]  I mean, I don't know if you ever have gone through stuff with your kid with like creative
[01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:52.340]  spelling where like kids are encouraged to just try to spell stuff.
[01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:56.780]  However it drove me nuts.
[01:19:56.780 --> 01:19:57.780]  It did me at first.
[01:19:57.780 --> 01:20:01.300]  We had a conference with the teacher about it, but you know, when I was a kid, there's
[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:05.420]  no way you would see something on the wall outside your classroom with a typo on it.
[01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:09.020]  It'd be now red pen.
[01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:10.020]  Jonas's school.
[01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:14.900]  I don't know when, I don't think they started trying to enforce correct spelling until fourth
[01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:15.900]  grade.
[01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:20.460]  Like first, second, third grade, it's just spell it, spell everything however you want.
[01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:24.340]  And somehow the teachers are adept at reading it, but I was like, I don't need, I can't
[01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:25.340]  even.
[01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:27.500]  You got to unhook your mind and just in my case, you got to read it phonetically.
[01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:31.660]  I mean, it depends on which teeth my daughter is missing because she'll pronounce things
[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:34.300]  with a lisp like when she writes it.
[01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:38.700]  But I was a little concerned in a way that I'm usually not where I was like, is this
[01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:39.700]  okay?
[01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:40.700]  Like, should we be like fixing this?
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:42.780]  That's exactly what I thought.
[01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:45.380]  I had the exact same experience.
[01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:50.580]  And then what opened my eyes is I went to, one day I went to pick him up at school and
[01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:56.140]  outside his classroom was the, it was some project that the whole class had done.
[01:20:56.140 --> 01:21:02.040]  Everybody's was up on the tacked to the cork board that runs on the hallway.
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:05.660]  And I started looking at everybody else's in this class and they were all exactly the
[01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:08.140]  same like in terms of spelling.
[01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:09.140]  Illiterate.
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:10.140]  Right.
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:14.660]  It's embarrassing at first cause you're like, is mine the only kid who doesn't know how
[01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:17.660]  to spell words?
[01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:20.460]  I thought, oh, shoot, that's a big relief.
[01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:24.620]  I kept thinking there's got to be, we're going to get an uncomfortable teacher conference
[01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:28.020]  where they're going to say, Hey, he's got to, and then no, it never happened.
[01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:31.580]  And then like all of a sudden in fourth grade though, they started like correcting their
[01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:34.180]  spelling and the kids were all like, what the fuck?
[01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:35.180]  Yeah, right.
[01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:36.180]  Exactly.
[01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:37.180]  Well, I, you know, I get it.
[01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:38.180]  I think.
[01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:41.100]  It's who knows why anything does anything, John.
[01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:45.260]  It's so, it's so conceited for us to imagine that we can understand anything as lay people
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:47.660]  about how something works out or does it.
[01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:50.780]  But I will say, you know, what, when we brought this up with her teacher and I'm sure this
[01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:55.100]  is super interesting to people who want to know about the Apple ecosystem, but people,
[01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:57.460]  but we went in there like, Hey, is this, is this a good thing?
[01:21:57.460 --> 01:22:00.540]  And she said, look, it's first grade, you know, she's at that time six.
[01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:04.180]  Like we, I just want her to come in here and write as much as she can every day.
[01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:09.700]  And I was like, but shouldn't she just be writing a lowercase letter a 40 times on a
[01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:12.300]  page like we did.
[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:16.540]  And the funny part is she does, she loves, she, I think she has graph Ophelia.
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:20.340]  We put on a, like a, we put on like a, a, like a Harry Potter audio book when she gets
[01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:24.820]  home from school and she sits there and makes art and draws and writes for like two hours.
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:28.900]  I never would've, I mean, I would've scribbled a little bit and colored maybe at her age,
[01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:30.220]  but now she's doing stuff.
[01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:32.740]  She's teaching herself cursive by tracing.
[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:37.540]  I had zero just in cursive when I was seven, six or seven years old teaching it now to
[01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:40.860]  herself cause it's fun cause it's all it, I guess it just all seems doable.
[01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:44.260]  So why wouldn't I just teach myself cursive?
[01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:47.780]  I guess my only interest in it when I was that early is I want to be able to read my
[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:50.060]  parents and stuff.
[01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:54.060]  Not like, like diaries or whatever, but it seemed like my parents had this secret language
[01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:55.220]  that I couldn't understand.
[01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:58.340]  Like my mom would write a shopping list and I couldn't read it.
[01:22:58.340 --> 01:23:00.220]  Right, right, right, right.
[01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:02.260]  Well, you know, it's to state the obvious.
[01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:06.860]  I think, you know, when you have stuff that you want to read, when you have an incentive,
[01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:11.660]  I mean the obvious example being like, Oh, a list of ideas for presents or something
[01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:13.460]  or anything like whatever stuff on screen.
[01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:18.180]  And in my case with my kid comics, like she can suss out a huge amount of the story from
[01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:22.580]  the sequential art, but then she can also like put together enough of the words to know
[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:26.740]  what it says without me reading it, which I find fantastic.
[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:28.420]  You know, it's, it's weird though.
[01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:32.300]  Because like, I'm, I'm, I have really mixed feelings about a lot of stuff with the school
[01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:33.300]  stuff.
[01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:37.580]  We've got the common core here, you know, which is the, I guess the progeny of No Child
[01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:41.380]  Left Behind was lots of things you have to teach a certain way, you got to be tested
[01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:42.380]  a certain way.
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:45.140]  And some of it, did you have new math when you were a kid?
[01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:47.420]  Remember new math and your parents, parents were always confused.
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:51.140]  They, there's kind of a new version of new math that is completely mind boggling.
[01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:54.500]  Yeah, I didn't like the way they taught math and it did.
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:56.860]  I don't think it worked very well for Jonas.
[01:23:56.860 --> 01:24:00.220]  I, math is, he's just not, not a math person.
[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:01.220]  Yeah.
[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:03.540]  And I was, I took to math like a fish to water.
[01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:07.240]  Like I was always very, very, I never, I don't even know how I learned everything.
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:10.160]  You could just show it to me as a kid and I figured it out.
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:11.700]  Some kids just see stuff.
[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:16.140]  And it's just, I really, maybe because I'm a slightly visual person, I think about like
[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:21.160]  some people, people with perfect pitch basically see notes in the way that I see colors.
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:24.060]  People with math see relationships that I don't see.
[01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:29.140]  And I think some people are really just wired that way and boy, God bless the man or woman
[01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:33.100]  who can identify that in your kid and, and know what that's going to mean for them both
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:35.060]  up and down as they go forward.
[01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:39.260]  The thing that they didn't do, and I don't even know what the, what the teaching method
[01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:42.820]  is, but they, when I was in first grade, we memorized everything.
[01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:46.500]  We had to memorize six plus seven is 13, seven plus six is 13.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:48.880]  Seven plus, yeah, memorize them all.
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:50.460]  And we had speed tests.
[01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:55.340]  And that's all I remember from first grade math is, you know, we'd get like a sheet with
[01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:59.460]  40, you know, basic addition problems like that.
[01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:02.680]  And you'd only have like 90 seconds or two minutes to do it.
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:05.460]  And if, you know, it was expected that some of the kids weren't even going to complete
[01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:08.700]  the whole thing because it was not just about accuracy, it was about, you know, getting
[01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:11.100]  fast at it.
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:16.300]  Jonas's school never, you know, encouraged any kind of memorization of anything.
[01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:17.300]  And in fact,
[01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:20.940]  I just remember times tables like in third grade going on forever and ever.
[01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:21.940]  No.
[01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:26.580]  And in fact, they were allowed to, like with times tables, you know, like you just like
[01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:32.780]  the matrix, you know, the sick, you know, the numbers across numbers down and you go
[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:35.800]  down and over and you can get the product.
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:38.900]  They were allowed to use that chart when they take tests.
[01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:39.900]  Wow.
[01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:43.900]  And it to me is crazy because it's like, well, that's what the test was when we were kids.
[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:44.900]  Yeah.
[01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:50.940]  And you know, it takes them forever to do, to complete a math test in third grade.
[01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:56.420]  That's what we did every day is we practiced products and then we had the same, you know,
[01:25:56.420 --> 01:26:00.380]  in a different order, like mixed up and we did the same 100 problems then.
[01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:02.660]  And that's what we did every single day.
[01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:07.420]  But you know, my take on it as a parent is I, I, you know, I'm certainly interested in
[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:11.380]  this education, but I'm not going to pretend like I'm an education expert and that the
[01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:16.900]  people, you know, who are education experts that, you know, just because this confounds
[01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:22.940]  my common sense approach, I don't want to be that guy, you know.
[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:24.460]  There are so many of that guy, John.
[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:25.460]  Right.
[01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:27.220]  My wife does a lot of stuff with PTA.
[01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:29.380]  She's really involved in the PTA.
[01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:34.300]  And like there are so many of that guy or gal and it's just the person who comes in
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:38.260]  who read something in the New Yorker and like they got some ideas about how to really shake
[01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:39.260]  things up.
[01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:43.020]  And it's not that different from your 22 year old friend who's giving you advice on child
[01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:44.020]  rearing.
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:45.020]  Right.
[01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:48.660]  You know, it's like, and let me just say in terms of disclosure, nothing in this world
[01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:52.580]  is more humbling or educational for me than walking in like volunteering in the classroom,
[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:53.660]  going on a field trip.
[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:56.980]  And I realized how much I am doing horribly wrong compared to these teachers.
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:57.980]  And I'm the one with all the smart ideas.
[01:26:57.980 --> 01:26:58.980]  Right.
[01:26:58.980 --> 01:26:59.980]  I went to college and stuff.
[01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:00.980]  Right.
[01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:01.980]  You've been such a dumbass.
[01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:07.340]  So I don't go into the, you know, I, I'm certainly thinking I, it seems to me that they could,
[01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:11.620]  it would do well if they would just spend a month or two honing in on memorizing, you
[01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:16.100]  know, some of these math facts, but I don't go into the teacher conference and say, here's
[01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:17.100]  what you should do.
[01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:18.100]  You know?
[01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:19.100]  Yeah.
[01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.100]  Yeah.
[01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:22.660]  I kind of don't, I, I have to admit, I don't understand how you would not do that, but
[01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:25.140]  then I look at her homework and I'm sure you've seen numerous things.
[01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:29.080]  There's probably whole tumblers devoted to the wackadoodle way they're supposed to do
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:34.140]  math now with these word problems and stuff like that, fact, fact, fact, families and
[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:37.300]  stuff like that where it's, you know, and again, it's,
[01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:41.580]  it's kind of a meme, but you'll see stuff where, where it's like, no, no, you don't
[01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:45.200]  subtract 111 from two 17 like that.
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.480]  You have to do this from that and this from that.
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:49.740]  And then imagine that there's a hundred of these and three left over.
[01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:54.140]  And I'm like, I, I honestly don't know how to do math that way, but I guess there's a
[01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:57.460]  reason, I guess there's a reason people like you probably like, you figured out a lot of
[01:27:57.460 --> 01:28:01.560]  the tricks about getting close to something and then figuring out the rest, right.
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:04.700]  You figured that out a long time ago, you know, I'm talking about like, some people
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:10.220]  have that learn these tricks for like a quick estimation and then getting it right after
[01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:11.220]  the estimation.
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:12.900]  I bet you, you've been good at that forever.
[01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:15.700]  Yeah, it's always just came naturally.
[01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:20.300]  The one thing I remember, I remember being very proud of myself for is at some point,
[01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:24.700]  I don't know when it, I don't know when I learned everything, but it was third, fourth,
[01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:28.700]  fifth grade, somewhere in there, probably before fifth, but at some point, but we hadn't
[01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:32.500]  learned long division yet as a, as a class.
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:34.180]  And we took a standardized test.
[01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:35.180]  What do we used to take?
[01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:36.180]  The Iowa test?
[01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:37.180]  Oh, right.
[01:28:37.180 --> 01:28:38.180]  Yes.
[01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:39.180]  Yes.
[01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:40.180]  Yes.
[01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:41.180]  I, that does ring a bell.
[01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:43.020]  I don't know if everybody, I don't know why we took the Iowa test, but we used to, I grew
[01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:46.940]  up in Pennsylvania, but we took the Iowa test of basic skills and it was like, you know,
[01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:54.660]  like the SAT for, for grade school kids and there was long, long division on it.
[01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:55.940]  And I didn't, I was like, Ooh.
[01:28:55.940 --> 01:29:00.460]  And I kind of had like test anxiety and I was, I, but I've somehow figured out a way
[01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:01.460]  to get the answer.
[01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:05.300]  I somehow taught myself long division before we ever learned it.
[01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:08.260]  And I remember my teacher asked me, I had totally aced it.
[01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:11.600]  I got like an, I think the highest score, it was like a percentage.
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:15.620]  I got like a 99% on the math and my teacher asked me, how'd you get, how'd you get this
[01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:16.620]  one?
[01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:20.580]  And I explained it and he was like, that's, you know, that's fascinating because that's
[01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:23.900]  not the right way to do it, but it's, it is a way to get the answer.
[01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:24.900]  Yeah.
[01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:25.900]  It's funny.
[01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:27.500]  If you think about it, when you ask somebody to show their work, on the one hand, it's
[01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:28.500]  completely sensible.
[01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:32.980]  Like if you're, especially something like long division showing your work is an indication
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:35.980]  that you understand how to, how to solve this.
[01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:40.980]  But what it really shows is you learn how to solve this in the way that I taught it.
[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:45.220]  If I mean, cause the thing is in, in, at least in arithmetic, maybe not in higher math, but
[01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:48.920]  in arithmetic, there's an answer like this times, this will always be that there's no
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:52.140]  quantum mechanics, the basic arithmetic level.
[01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:56.220]  And so, you know, the thing is if you can just look at a problem like whatever, 17 times
[01:29:56.220 --> 01:30:00.740]  nine, and know what that answer is without having to show your work, it seems kind of
[01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:01.740]  weird.
[01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:03.120]  Cause you just, some people just see those numbers.
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:06.140]  I mean, I really admire people who can do that where they just, they, you know what
[01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:07.140]  I'm talking about?
[01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:10.300]  It's almost like, like a, a rain man kind of thing where some people can just see that
[01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:12.520]  they don't need to show the work cause there's no work to be shown.
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.700]  It's just that this will all this times that will always be that.
[01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:15.700]  And I know that.
[01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:16.700]  Yeah.
[01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:17.700]  Yeah.
[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:20.240]  Soon as you said 17 times nine, I thought one 53.
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:21.240]  Is that what it is?
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:22.240]  Yeah.
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:23.240]  Are you kidding?
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:32.200]  No, because it's a, you do, you just do asterisk checks out one 53 spotlight says, right?
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:36.100]  Cause you do 10 times, you do 10 times nine to get 90 and then you do seven times nine
[01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:38.140]  to get 63 and you add them together.
[01:30:38.140 --> 01:30:39.140]  Oh my God.
[01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:40.140]  I hate you.
[01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:41.140]  Oh my God.
[01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:44.220]  You might've, you might as well be like telling my future from tea leaves.
[01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:45.220]  I can't believe you.
[01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:46.220]  Do you know what though?
[01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:47.600]  We had one time with the teacher conference.
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:50.900]  This is, I love, I love having you on the show, but one time I did talk to him with
[01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:54.300]  Jonas's teacher about it a little, not in a way where I was trying to prescribe how
[01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:58.180]  I thought they should teach math, but just to express things he found on the internet.
[01:30:58.180 --> 01:31:00.180]  Uh, no, not at all.
[01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:02.900]  I was just sort of like what's your take and, and her explanation.
[01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:07.660]  And I do believe this is there's, there's not as much point to memorizing this stuff
[01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:12.120]  going through life because everybody has computers with them everywhere they go.
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:17.300]  You know, it's, it's sort of like more or less, you know, but in a way that made a lot
[01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:22.220]  of sense to me that what, you know, if we teach them these story-based ideas, but know
[01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:26.660]  that, you know, on the assumption that they're going to actually use calculators and stuff,
[01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:31.200]  you know, to do it, they'll understand what's actually necessary.
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:32.200]  I don't know.
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:33.700]  There's something like that.
[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:34.700]  Hmm.
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:37.900]  Like what's the point of learning all this stuff if you don't, you know, if you're never
[01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:39.500]  going to actually do it by hand anyway.
[01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:44.420]  Well, you know, back to that idea though of what's, what people's natural kind of faculties
[01:31:44.420 --> 01:31:49.380]  are, to use that word story in a slightly broader sense, I mean, if you think about
[01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:53.660]  how many of the things you learn in elementary school will either be, will either connect
[01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:56.740]  with you or they won't based on whether you get the story.
[01:31:56.740 --> 01:32:01.100]  So the problem is if you get history taught in an uninteresting way or by an uninspired
[01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:04.840]  teacher, you see it as a collection of facts to be memorized instead of seeing that as
[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:09.620]  a story, you know, and there's a reason why until I went to college, I still continue
[01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:14.740]  to call everything in, including arithmetic, just math, cause that was math, not understanding
[01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:18.100]  that there's, there's a bigger story to tell here than plus minus, you know, times and
[01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:19.100]  divided by you.
[01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:20.140]  Do you know what I mean?
[01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:23.180]  It's like, but there are some people who really have that natural affinity of being able to
[01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:28.100]  just look at these patterns and it, and it makes sense and maybe they're learning a word
[01:32:28.100 --> 01:32:34.220]  for what that's actually called, but you know, gosh, I just feel like having to have a teachers
[01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:38.800]  who are able to, to suss that out and then put up with the parents who come in and give
[01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:43.500]  them things they found in mother Jones, what a job I do.
[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:48.060]  I do think, and it sounds like it's the same with, with your school.
[01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:52.460]  I do feel like the one to add, so the math, you know, I don't know, what do I know?
[01:32:52.460 --> 01:32:57.520]  I kind of think they're doing it wrong, but whatever.
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:01.660]  But with the writing, I do kind of see where they're going and where I do object to the
[01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:05.220]  idea that spelling doesn't count, but eventually it does start to count.
[01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:09.460]  But I do that we had the same thing where there, they just want the kids to write stories
[01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:12.020]  like from like first grade on.
[01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:14.700]  And I do see that there, that's very different.
[01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:16.300]  I don't remember ever just writing.
[01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:20.580]  I mean, when I was in first grade, we used to, you know, I mean, it was the, um, what
[01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:24.100]  you were writing about was a McGuffin, the, the whole idea of having like what you did
[01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:25.100]  over Thanksgiving.
[01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:26.980]  Well, nobody really cared what they, what you did over Thanksgiving.
[01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:30.900]  They wanted to make sure you could still write in cursive and knew how to punctuate it and
[01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:31.900]  spell it right.
[01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:32.900]  Right.
[01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:35.060]  Whereas now it wasn't really about telling, writing anything.
[01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:39.060]  It was about demonstrating you had the mechanical skills you've been taught.
[01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:40.060]  Yeah.
[01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:43.820]  Whereas now it seems like it's more about, they really want to train those muscles in
[01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:49.100]  their minds at an early age to be able to express, take your thoughts and express them.
[01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:54.420]  And that worrying about spelling is just all, it's just roadblocks to getting that out on
[01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:55.420]  the page.
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:34:00.800]  And you know, as a professional writer, there is a line, there's certainly a very common
[01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:06.940]  line of advice for adult writers, people writing that your first draft, you should just go,
[01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:08.600]  just get it on the page.
[01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:09.600]  Don't worry.
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:14.180]  Turn off the thing that makes red underlines and stuff like that and just go and get it
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:19.400]  out on the page and then go back and do the stuff like, Oh, you didn't even uppercase
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:24.700]  that the character to start that sentence you, you know, you misspelled some words you,
[01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:27.460]  you know, totally need commas to close.
[01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:28.960]  Don't worry about that in the first draft.
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:30.040]  I don't really write like that.
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:33.380]  I kind of, well, cause you don't, you don't need to, but, but what you're describing,
[01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:37.940]  I totally agree with you because what I feel like, and I might be oversimplifying this,
[01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:44.000]  but I really do feel like, um, something that always inhibited me a little bit was if there
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:50.060]  was one thing where I got it a little bit, it wasn't things like English language arts,
[01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:54.780]  you know, and the idea of having to write a paper was not the thing that worried me
[01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:56.100]  or was fretful to me.
[01:34:56.100 --> 01:34:59.940]  The thing that I didn't like was having to go and do the process of doing the index cards
[01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:04.020]  I'd like to index cards always have, but having to do the index cards, turn the index cards
[01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:06.900]  into an outline that you have to turn in as part of the theme.
[01:35:06.900 --> 01:35:11.100]  Whereas I feel like, man, I could write this thing in my sleep, but all these, all these
[01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:16.380]  other, this weird artificial scaffolding that I guess proves I learned your process like
[01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:18.280]  that always got in the way.
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:20.860]  And I think there's that still that voice in a lot of people's heads.
[01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:24.660]  If they want to write anything where they're going to, they're going to, but they would
[01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:27.220]  never in a million years turn off the red underlining cause that's how they know they're
[01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:28.220]  doing it right.
[01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:30.180]  So it doesn't make any sense what they're actually writing.
[01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:32.540]  No, I, that's, I had the same thing.
[01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:37.380]  Like we learned in my school, elementary school like this and it was year after year, it wasn't
[01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:38.380]  just like one teacher.
[01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:43.580]  It was like the curriculum was this sort of formal, uh, you mentioned the index cards.
[01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:44.580]  I actually did.
[01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:45.580]  I forgot about that.
[01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:48.140]  I remember the outline, but I do think that there was a time when we were supposed to
[01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:49.140]  use index cards too.
[01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:52.900]  When you went to the library and did your research, there was like, in my case, a pretty
[01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:56.300]  prescriptive way you're supposed to make notes on every index card.
[01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:57.300]  Right.
[01:35:57.300 --> 01:35:58.300]  And the outline that had weird rules.
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:02.820]  So like you had to start like with like uppercase letters and then the next level of hierarchy
[01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:04.620]  was like lowercase letters.
[01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:05.860]  That all went into the grade.
[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:09.300]  Like if you use a numeral two instead of a Roman numeral two at the wrong place, that
[01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:10.300]  was marked against you.
[01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:13.640]  And it's like, what better way to disrupt somebody's thought process and then by having
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:16.780]  them think about what kind of digit to use to brainstorm.
[01:36:16.780 --> 01:36:17.780]  Right.
[01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:19.860]  Just, uh, just to get your ideas out.
[01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:20.860]  Right.
[01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:21.860]  And it was, yeah.
[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:25.780]  And I remember the Roman numerals part cause I was something that I was never good at.
[01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:27.380]  Actually never good at Roman numerals.
[01:36:27.380 --> 01:36:32.340]  You know, I, once I got past five, it was, you know, with the whole thing where you put
[01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:37.340]  the ones before the digit and, uh, never, never worked for me.
[01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:42.180]  I mean, I still have to sit there and when I'm watching like the, like a super bowl kind
[01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:46.740]  of notation, I still have to mentally sit there and do the equivalent of arithmetic
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:49.300]  to figure out, Oh, 39.
[01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:54.500]  I have no idea if the super bowl is right, except no, I don't.
[01:36:54.500 --> 01:37:00.500]  When they hit 50 50 was awesome because it was, I don't even know what it was, but it's
[01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:03.220]  just like an L or something like CM.
[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:04.220]  I don't know.
[01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:06.380]  I hate the super bowl with the Roman numerals.
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:10.860]  Just fricking I've, I really, I wish I would have made like a public campaign for it.
[01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:18.220]  I, you know, it's really unnecessarily pretentious given the audience, I guess it seems fancy,
[01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:23.860]  but once they hit 50 that's where they should have stopped and just, you know, just super
[01:37:23.860 --> 01:37:28.620]  bowl 2014 super bowl 2015 ugly numbers.
[01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:30.180]  It's all ugly at this point.
[01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:31.460]  It's really bad.
[01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:33.820]  It was, it only made sense.
[01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:36.820]  It's like with the Rocky films, they use Roman numerals.
[01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:39.100]  Never go beyond the number of Rocky films that you know what?
[01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:40.100]  That's Gruber's rule.
[01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:41.100]  No.
[01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:42.100]  Yeah.
[01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:43.100]  It's your dude.
[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:44.980]  If you need more than that, you use a, use a, use a numeral.
[01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:46.140]  That's yeah, exactly.
[01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:51.020]  Rocky, the upper bound on, on Roman numerals is where that was like seven, something like
[01:37:51.020 --> 01:37:52.020]  that.
[01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:53.020]  Nine, 12, how many?
[01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:54.500]  Yeah, but they made the most recent one.
[01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:56.220]  They didn't put a Roman numeral behind.
[01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:57.560]  Even they wouldn't break the Rocky rule.
[01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:01.540]  Like they stopped adding Roman numerals and made like, you know, Rocky forever or something.
[01:38:01.540 --> 01:38:02.540]  Rocky Balboa.
[01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:03.540]  Yeah.
[01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:04.540]  Yeah.
[01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:05.540]  That's it.
[01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:06.540]  Rocky Balboa.
[01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:07.540]  Rocky.
[01:38:07.540 --> 01:38:08.540]  Look at that guy.
[01:38:08.540 --> 01:38:09.540]  Look at the head on that guy.
[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:10.540]  Rocky films.
[01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:11.540]  God, I love Wikipedia.
[01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:12.860]  I'm looking at it right now.
[01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:13.860]  Rocky Balboa.
[01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:14.860]  Here we go.
[01:38:14.860 --> 01:38:15.860]  They went to Rocky five.
[01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:16.860]  That's it.
[01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:17.860]  And then they went to Rocky Balboa.
[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:18.860]  Creed.
[01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:19.860]  There's one called Creed.
[01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:20.860]  That must be upcoming.
[01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:27.340]  I think I heard about this spin off it's Creed's grandson.
[01:38:27.340 --> 01:38:28.340]  Michael B. Jordan.
[01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:29.340]  Is that the guy from the wire?
[01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:30.340]  Yeah.
[01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:31.340]  I think so.
[01:38:31.340 --> 01:38:32.340]  Damn.
[01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:33.340]  Look at that.
[01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:34.340]  It's a it's, what's his name?
[01:38:34.340 --> 01:38:35.340]  It says that Wallace.
[01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:36.340]  That's Wallace.
[01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:37.340]  Wallace is everywhere.
[01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:38.340]  Now.
[01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:39.340]  This is crazy.
[01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:40.340]  Yeah.
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:41.340]  Geez.
[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:45.980]  So they went to Rocky five and then that's it.
[01:38:45.980 --> 01:38:46.980]  You know what?
[01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:47.980]  I'll, you know, I'm just going to stay on the strength.
[01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:49.860]  I'm okay with seven.
[01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:51.180]  I think eight is ugly.
[01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:52.340]  I think nine is excreble.
[01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:55.860]  I don't want to, I don't want to look at an IX.
[01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:58.140]  See when you start going before the numbers.
[01:38:58.140 --> 01:38:59.140]  That's just ridiculous.
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:00.780]  Although I think I told you this when I was a kid.
[01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:06.340]  Our creature feature was on WXIX channel 19, which you got to give them credit.
[01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:07.340]  That's pretty great.
[01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:08.340]  XIX.
[01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:09.340]  Yeah.
[01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:10.340]  Yeah.
[01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:15.040]  Cause it's, you know, it's got like a nice, uh, uh, what's that called, uh, too clever
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:19.820]  by half now, but the, uh, palin palindrome that's a palindrome.
[01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:20.820]  Right.
[01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:21.820]  Right.
[01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:22.820]  Right.
[01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:23.820]  Symmetry.
[01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:24.820]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:29.100]  There's a, there's a pretty visual symmetry to it.
[01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:36.580]  The Roman neural system, how did they even, how did, uh, it's amazing that, uh, uh, uh,
[01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:42.020]  a culture that came up with that had any success at all, let alone, uh, like a continent spanning
[01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:43.020]  empire.
[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:44.020]  Oh, a hundred percent.
[01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:49.340]  It really seems like the kind of thing you make deliberately difficult to confuse normal
[01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:51.020]  people.
[01:39:51.020 --> 01:39:53.460]  It's like one, two and three are all right.
[01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:54.460]  You're I'm with you.
[01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:55.460]  So let me explain.
[01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:56.460]  Here's how it works.
[01:39:56.460 --> 01:39:57.460]  This is a one.
[01:39:57.460 --> 01:39:58.460]  Okay.
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:39:59.460]  It's one mark.
[01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:00.460]  Here's the two.
[01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:01.460]  Okay.
[01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:02.460]  You make two marks.
[01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:03.460]  Can you guess what three is?
[01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:04.460]  Is it three marks?
[01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:05.460]  Yep.
[01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:06.460]  And what about four?
[01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:07.460]  That's IV.
[01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:08.460]  Right.
[01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:09.460]  Immediately.
[01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:10.460]  What's a V. Hang on.
[01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:11.460]  We're not there yet.
[01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:12.460]  First learn IV.
[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:13.460]  You got to learn IV before you learn V.
[01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:14.460]  Right.
[01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:18.660]  At that point in the discussion, you only have to get to four before you automatically,
[01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:23.580]  like whoever came up with it, you got to say, no, no, I think that's a, it's like a Turing
[01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:24.580]  thing.
[01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:26.820]  It's like, it just, it doesn't make sense.
[01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:31.680]  You have to know about five, which you haven't even gotten to.
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:34.620]  It's like those directions where like you realize you should have read them all the
[01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:37.140]  way through before you started.
[01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:40.540]  Like step eight has something you were supposed to have done back in step four.
[01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:43.600]  It's exactly, exactly.
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:45.660]  That's probably why my cable went out.
[01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:48.220]  Uh, I skipped, skip step.
[01:40:48.220 --> 01:40:50.380]  I didn't read step eight before I did step six.
[01:40:50.380 --> 01:40:56.180]  No, but you know how it's like, like our, our decimal notation, it breaks down after
[01:40:56.180 --> 01:41:00.700]  a certain large number and that's why we switched to the exponential notation for very, very
[01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:01.700]  large numbers.
[01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:06.940]  And you know, that's, and that's something that never made sense to me or it made sense,
[01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:11.020]  but I always had to go back and look it up and it's just telling you how many zeros are
[01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:12.740]  on the 10 or something.
[01:41:12.740 --> 01:41:18.260]  But it's because, you know, for dealing with those truly staggeringly large numbers, writing
[01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:19.780]  it all out doesn't make sense.
[01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:21.980]  Roman numerals break down at four.
[01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:24.860]  Yeah, it's one thing with pie.
[01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:28.660]  Like people have their reasons for wanting to get in 50 to 50 places in pie and that's
[01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:33.300]  a level of complexity that we accept even if not always totally understand.
[01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:39.100]  But to have an idea of a fucking broken four, that's, I mean, it seems like that that's
[01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:42.720]  a good first draft, but let's try that again.
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:44.520]  Now can you do four single strokes?
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:46.340]  Is that acceptable as an alternative?
[01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:48.980]  I think IV is canonical.
[01:41:48.980 --> 01:41:54.840]  I think I've, as I recall, I believe that it's, it's a, it's sort of like the, in an
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:59.420]  English language, it's like it's going to get the, uh, the italicized informal, the
[01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:00.420]  INF.
[01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:01.420]  Yeah.
[01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:02.420]  Yeah.
[01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:03.420]  I think you're right.
[01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:04.420]  Yeah.
[01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:06.420]  Well, I don't know if you know, but I'm a third.
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:11.220]  I am a, my, my father and my grandfather share my name or I share their name, I should say.
[01:42:11.220 --> 01:42:15.620]  So I've had to, I've had to live with walking around putting Roman numerals after my name
[01:42:15.620 --> 01:42:20.260]  and nothing makes you seem like a bigger dick faster than having Roman numerals after your
[01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:21.260]  name.
[01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:24.220]  That's always the bad guy in like an eighties, eighties comedy.
[01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:28.340]  For legal purposes, you, you, uh, you have to, well, they're dead now, so I think I can
[01:42:28.340 --> 01:42:31.180]  fly on that a little better, but I'm sitting here and look at this.
[01:42:31.180 --> 01:42:39.460]  One is an I, five is a V, 10 is an X, 50 is an L. So you can't even do X, X, X, X, X.
[01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:40.460]  So I was right.
[01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:46.340]  It was, there was the one glorious year where the super, it was like super bowl L. Right.
[01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:50.580]  But even that it was, at least it was understandable, but even that it kind of looks stupid, right?
[01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:55.540]  Cause when you think Samsung tablet, right, when you think super bowl, you, you think
[01:42:55.540 --> 01:43:00.460]  a lot of X's and uh, you know, and you know what I'm, one of the reasons I feel like it's
[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:05.540]  stuck is that X, I, you know, I've said this many times in the show, X is clearly the coolest
[01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:06.540]  letter of the alphabet.
[01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:07.540]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:14.100]  So the whole logic behind calling the Mac operating system, OS 10 is just that the X
[01:43:14.100 --> 01:43:15.220]  looks cool.
[01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:18.120]  It's got, it's got a diagonals and diagonals look great.
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:24.060]  It's just diagonals and they cross, it looks super X-ray vision.
[01:43:24.060 --> 01:43:31.580]  You know, that's, you know, the, the letter for secret agents, uh, X rated film, you know,
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:32.580]  right?
[01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:35.940]  It's, you know, that's what you get on the smoker channels when you get your smokers.
[01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:36.940]  That's right.
[01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:38.340]  No, it's the win.
[01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:41.360]  And I feel like that's why the super bowl stuck with it because they got to put a lot
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:42.360]  of X's in the name.
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:47.640]  Why did they always do Roman numerals for years on old movies?
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:50.980]  Is that, do you think that's a tradition or a rule or like an industry thing?
[01:43:50.980 --> 01:43:51.980]  Like, you know what I mean?
[01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:55.560]  When you say for the year, yeah, they would always show on TV shows and movies to show
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:56.560]  the year it was made.
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:58.660]  It would always be in Roman numerals.
[01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:05.660]  I think it was just like a format, you know, like a, like a, uh, I don't know, like a tradition.
[01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:06.660]  Yeah.
[01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:07.660]  I don't know.
[01:44:07.660 --> 01:44:08.660]  I think it was just like a tradition.
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:14.260]  Tarantino did it on one of his, uh, like a retro, like that roadhouse movie or whatever
[01:44:14.260 --> 01:44:15.260]  the hell it was called.
[01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:16.260]  Yeah.
[01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:19.140]  When you see it like a title screen that's got a Roman numeral date on it, that, that
[01:44:19.140 --> 01:44:20.140]  really is like a throwback.
[01:44:20.140 --> 01:44:21.140]  Yeah.
[01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:22.140]  It's like the expendables.
[01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:23.140]  Maybe.
[01:44:23.140 --> 01:44:24.140]  Can't tell.
[01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:25.140]  I don't know.
[01:44:25.140 --> 01:44:26.140]  Let me take a break.
[01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:27.140]  I got another sponsor to talk about.
[01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:28.920]  I don't want to, I want to tell everybody about him.
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:31.180]  It's another longtime friend of the show.
[01:44:31.180 --> 01:44:34.340]  Returned sponsor are good friends at igloo igloo.
[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:41.620]  Now they, that's the intranet you'll actually like, uh, it's built with easy to use apps
[01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:46.860]  like shared calendars, Twitter, like micro blogs, file sharing, task management, and
[01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:47.860]  more.
[01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:51.420]  So you put your team together, you start your own little, uh, Twitter microblog thing on
[01:44:51.420 --> 01:44:52.420]  igloo.
[01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:56.900]  And it's like you have a Twitter that is private to your team instead of being out in the public.
[01:44:56.900 --> 01:45:03.220]  But that way you can just comment on things, uh, keep it all in your, within your team
[01:45:03.220 --> 01:45:05.500]  for privacy purposes.
[01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:10.980]  It's everything you need to work better in one very configurable cloud platform.
[01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:12.740]  Now they have responsive design.
[01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:18.340]  Everything works great on your phone, your Android phone, your iOS device, your tablet,
[01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:24.420]  your laptop, obviously, um, it works great with the bigger screen iPhones right away.
[01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:27.980]  It's all, you know, uh, responsive.
[01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:33.900]  You can review documents, you post project updates, change administrative settings, um,
[01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:37.920]  or even complain about why they, you know, there's a U2 album stuck in your iTunes right
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:39.560]  there from your phone.
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:41.900]  Everything you can do on igloo, you can do right from the phone.
[01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:46.020]  Uh, when you design your igloo, you have a whole bunch of choices.
[01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:51.980]  You get to change, um, uh, the changes you make carry across all devices.
[01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:55.940]  So it's not just like, Oh, there's this one special look for the iPhone.
[01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:58.620]  But then when you make the design changes, you only see them on the desktop.
[01:45:58.620 --> 01:46:04.660]  No, the design changes you make go all the way from your, uh, brand new retina iMac right
[01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:05.660]  down to your iPhone.
[01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:09.940]  Uh, they have a file preview engine, fully HTML five compatible.
[01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:13.700]  Uh, so, um, you can preview everything online.
[01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:14.700]  Yeah.
[01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:18.500]  I had comments, new versions of files, everything you want to do.
[01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:23.280]  Um, here's the thing they want to talk about this thing called Gartner's magic quadrant.
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:25.420]  Now this is all outside my wheelhouse.
[01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:31.060]  This is Casey's terms is out in the parking lot for me, but, uh, but it's a big deal for,
[01:46:31.060 --> 01:46:34.940]  for, uh, people who work, you know, probably a lot of you who are listening to the show
[01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:39.980]  work out there, uh, and where, you know, things like white papers or things you encounter
[01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:40.980]  all the time.
[01:46:40.980 --> 01:46:47.820]  Um, so just this past week, Gartner released their famed magic quadrant for social software
[01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:48.820]  in the workplace.
[01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:53.300]  That's a white paper they put out, um, every year.
[01:46:53.300 --> 01:46:57.600]  Igloo appears for the sixth consecutive year and it's right alongside.
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:04.220]  This is who they're up there with Microsoft, IBM, Google, VMware, Salesforce, and a SAP.
[01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:09.700]  Um, so it's a report that values the size of the vendor in Gartner's terms.
[01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:15.660]  This is viability Igloo is praised for their responsiveness and customer experience.
[01:47:15.660 --> 01:47:19.660]  Um, here's an excerpt right from the Gartner's profile of Igloo.
[01:47:19.660 --> 01:47:25.100]  This is Gartner's words, feedback from Igloo's reference customers was consistently positive.
[01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:30.620]  They praised the product's quick deployment, configuration, and customization flexibility
[01:47:30.620 --> 01:47:36.180]  with self service options for non-technical users control over branding and information
[01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:38.540]  organization and ease of use.
[01:47:38.540 --> 01:47:43.660]  They also praise the responsiveness of Igloo as an organization.
[01:47:43.660 --> 01:47:45.380]  So really there it is right there.
[01:47:45.380 --> 01:47:49.980]  It's a third party, you know, Gartner telling you exactly the things that I've been telling
[01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:55.460]  you about Igloo for telling you, uh, Igloo is all kinds of responsive, right?
[01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:57.460]  And well, what it is is it's easy.
[01:47:57.460 --> 01:47:58.460]  It's supposed to be.
[01:47:58.460 --> 01:47:59.460]  That's their whole point.
[01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:02.420]  Their whole point is that all these intranets, these legacy ones like SharePoint and the
[01:48:02.420 --> 01:48:05.540]  old portal technology were a huge pain in the ass.
[01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:10.780]  They were confusing to set up, confusing to administer and confusing as hell to use.
[01:48:10.780 --> 01:48:13.060]  That's the big thing I think is that they were confused.
[01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:18.340]  I remember when I had, you know, had jobs and we used to share all those kinds of apps
[01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:19.340]  always.
[01:48:19.340 --> 01:48:22.380]  Even if you got the open source ones, you always kind of felt like it was the worst
[01:48:22.380 --> 01:48:23.380]  of every world.
[01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:25.260]  They were, they were difficult to deal with.
[01:48:25.260 --> 01:48:26.980]  There were some, they're real flimsy.
[01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:30.700]  They were real ugly to use and nobody wanted to use them and it wasn't just that they weren't
[01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:31.700]  fun.
[01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:35.060]  It was just that you, every time I would use those kinds of apps, I would think like, I
[01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:39.580]  don't understand who this is for and I've, I've used Igloo and like you understand it.
[01:48:39.580 --> 01:48:42.900]  You go in there, you turn on the stuff you need, turn off the stuff you don't, you get
[01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:46.140]  exactly what you want and it actually works and it is fun to use.
[01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:47.140]  Right.
[01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:50.300]  It's, you know, to me it's like the difference between like the old smartphones before the
[01:48:50.300 --> 01:48:54.380]  iPhone and it would be all these things and you'd be, I don't even know what this is.
[01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:55.380]  What is this?
[01:48:55.380 --> 01:48:56.380]  How do I even make an event in the calendar?
[01:48:56.380 --> 01:49:00.660]  I don't even know how to get there and then you got the iPhone and it's like, well, I
[01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:01.660]  get it.
[01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:04.780]  It's just, I just tap this calendar and there's my calendar and I hit this button, I go back
[01:49:04.780 --> 01:49:05.780]  to home.
[01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:08.220]  Well, Igloo is like that for team sharing.
[01:49:08.220 --> 01:49:10.140]  Here's the thing and it's amazing to me.
[01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:13.940]  Free to use with up to 10 people.
[01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:18.780]  So if you have a small team that's less than 10 people, you just get to use it forever
[01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:21.620]  like in perpetuity going forward without even paying for it.
[01:49:21.620 --> 01:49:23.920]  They're cool with that.
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:29.340]  And if you are from a bigger organization, you can try it out with up to 10 people before
[01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:34.380]  you spend a nickel to make sure that everything I'm telling you about it is true.
[01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:37.500]  And then they have really great, you know, once you go past 10 people, they have really,
[01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:43.180]  really great rates that are way, way less than you pay for competing crappier internets.
[01:49:43.180 --> 01:49:44.180]  Where do you go?
[01:49:44.180 --> 01:49:53.900]  Here's the, here's the address igloosoftware.com slash the talk show igloosoftware.com slash
[01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:54.900]  the talk show.
[01:49:54.900 --> 01:49:57.380]  And then they'll know you came right here from the show.
[01:49:57.380 --> 01:49:59.760]  So my thanks to them.
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:01.260]  Good people.
[01:50:01.260 --> 01:50:03.260]  Really good people.
[01:50:03.260 --> 01:50:04.260]  MCMLXVI.
[01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:08.980]  That's the year I was born.
[01:50:08.980 --> 01:50:10.980]  What a mess.
[01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:14.060]  It's horrible.
[01:50:14.060 --> 01:50:19.660]  I almost feel like it's one of those things like dropping in some casual Latin where it's
[01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:23.820]  like exactly what it's like where I'm specifically mentioning this cause I'm pretty sure you
[01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:26.820]  won't know what it means to be generous, right?
[01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:31.700]  And I spend a lot of, a lot of time, uh, learning it.
[01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:34.220]  So now I'm going to, I don't want to sound fancy per se.
[01:50:34.220 --> 01:50:35.220]  Right.
[01:50:35.220 --> 01:50:40.540]  It's just dropping in some Roman numerals.
[01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:44.940]  And what kept this, uh, Nova sorta, soclorum, um, just kind of a thing that's on my mind
[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:45.940]  right now.
[01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:48.940]  How's your internet doing?
[01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:51.820]  Uh, I think it's good.
[01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:52.820]  Nice.
[01:50:52.820 --> 01:50:53.820]  Hey.
[01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:58.340]  So, uh, before we, before we wrap this up, um, yeah, I want to, I want to, I don't want
[01:50:58.340 --> 01:50:59.340]  to say anything.
[01:50:59.340 --> 01:51:03.820]  It's your show, but I, you know, I've noticed you had some length creep and I don't know
[01:51:03.820 --> 01:51:07.820]  if it's not, it's not just, it would be nice to think that it's just Syracuse who I'm guessing
[01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:11.940]  broke your record, but there's been a lot of, there's been a lot of leakage time wise
[01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:12.940]  lately.
[01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:13.940]  Yeah.
[01:51:13.940 --> 01:51:15.340]  I don't know what to do about that.
[01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:19.540]  I'm not against it, but I think, yeah, given that we're not talking about ecosystems, it's
[01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:20.540]  probably better.
[01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:23.820]  We keep this one short, but, uh, you know, let's go meta on it though.
[01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:24.820]  That is good though.
[01:51:24.820 --> 01:51:25.820]  I do.
[01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:26.820]  I've absolutely positive.
[01:51:26.820 --> 01:51:27.820]  There's no denying it.
[01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:32.700]  This show has gotten longer where I used to try to keep it to be an hour cause I thought
[01:51:32.700 --> 01:51:34.260]  an hour is what a show should be.
[01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:35.260]  I did.
[01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:37.700]  I've never done anything for an hour.
[01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:42.780]  I've never done anything physical for more than an hour and I've never done anything
[01:51:42.780 --> 01:51:47.100]  involving talking for less than an hour.
[01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:56.140]  I never, I almost never hit that hour, but I, by trying to keep it an hour, I felt like
[01:51:56.140 --> 01:52:02.580]  it would, um, you know, it would keep it from going to two hours and then, you know, it
[01:52:02.580 --> 01:52:07.300]  would be like an hour and 37 minutes or an hour and 45 minutes and now it just blows
[01:52:07.300 --> 01:52:13.500]  past the two hour mark every show and a lot of people love it and here's the funny thing
[01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:14.500]  too.
[01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:21.060]  I, and I think part of it comes to the fact that that podcasting is still like a nascent
[01:52:21.060 --> 01:52:30.920]  medium like nobody's still, it's still, it is, it, our, our idea of what they should
[01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:35.100]  be and when people will listen to them and how often they'll listen to them has it.
[01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:39.340]  It's still liquid, you know, and it's like online videos where when I first started it,
[01:52:39.340 --> 01:52:42.140]  I did this thing briefly called the Merlin show, which is an interview show I did for
[01:52:42.140 --> 01:52:43.140]  a while.
[01:52:43.140 --> 01:52:46.420]  It was a tremendous amount of work for what we ended up getting, but everything I heard
[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:48.300]  from people was you can't put this thing up.
[01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:51.580]  You can't have a YouTube video that's more than 10 minutes long.
[01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:55.760]  There is nobody in the entire world that will watch a video 10 minutes really.
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:59.140]  That's like the stairway to heaven of online videos and it's like, I don't know.
[01:52:59.140 --> 01:53:02.900]  I think a 15 minute interview is not that much to expect with somebody, but people just
[01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:03.900]  shake their heads.
[01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:04.900]  Data for podcasts.
[01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:08.420]  I don't know if you remember this, but a lot of the advice I heard early on was never go
[01:53:08.420 --> 01:53:13.200]  past 30 minutes just because the files are so big and nobody will listen to anything
[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:15.020]  for that long.
[01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:20.260]  There's a, there, there are technical factors like how long it takes to download and how
[01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:25.940]  much it costs to distribute and you know, multiply the length of the show by the number
[01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:29.980]  of people doing it and the quality of the audio.
[01:53:29.980 --> 01:53:33.420]  You know, especially back when we were, everybody was hosting it themselves with metered bandwidth.
[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:34.420]  I mean that was, those were crazy.
[01:53:34.420 --> 01:53:37.940]  In the pre-libsyn days, I was, and this is not that long ago.
[01:53:37.940 --> 01:53:40.300]  I mean we're talking like five, six years ago.
[01:53:40.300 --> 01:53:41.300]  Yeah.
[01:53:41.300 --> 01:53:45.200]  Like five, six, seven years ago, um, it was a huge one.
[01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:50.320]  When Dan and I first started doing the talk show, it was just the download cost was a
[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:51.320]  huge thing.
[01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:52.320]  It really was.
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:57.020]  When you think about it, it was closer in, in, in relatively speaking in the, in the
[01:53:57.020 --> 01:54:00.620]  grand scheme of things, it was closer in time to the days of postage stamp size QuickTime
[01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:06.460]  videos then of like, like I just watched Tim and Eric's Totino's commercial in 1080p and
[01:54:06.460 --> 01:54:09.380]  I watched it like five times and I don't think they're going to be hurting because I did
[01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:10.380]  that.
[01:54:10.380 --> 01:54:11.380]  YouTube can handle that.
[01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:14.020]  But really seriously, when podcast started and I went and got my first libsyn account,
[01:54:14.020 --> 01:54:15.300]  it was the first thing I knew of.
[01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:17.700]  I mean, you know, you can get this to an extent with Squarespace.
[01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:21.540]  Libsyn was the first one I knew of that had unmetered bandwidth, which seemed completely
[01:54:21.540 --> 01:54:24.620]  untenable because it was so expensive.
[01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:27.840]  If you had it on your hosted account, just sitting there, your bandwidth would be gone
[01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:28.840]  in an hour.
[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:31.220]  Even if your show wasn't that popular, you're done.
[01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:34.620]  You couldn't have a 30 meg file that more than a few people downloaded.
[01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:35.620]  Yeah.
[01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:43.760]  And there's things too like, uh, uh, the fact that people listen using different, uh, apps.
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:48.820]  So one person might have two or three downloads of the show because they've got one in iTunes
[01:54:48.820 --> 01:54:55.020]  at their work and they've got one in iTunes at their home and one in Overcast on their
[01:54:55.020 --> 01:54:56.020]  phone.
[01:54:56.020 --> 01:54:59.220]  And, you know, it really, really adds up at some point.
[01:54:59.220 --> 01:55:05.500]  But in today's world, it's, you know, the bandwidth is effectively free, which is crazy.
[01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:10.520]  Um, we, I used to get, we used to get complaints a lot when we went over an hour.
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:14.940]  People would say, man, I love your show, but you got to keep it under an hour on the show
[01:55:14.940 --> 01:55:15.940]  with Dan.
[01:55:15.940 --> 01:55:22.740]  Yeah, and this, this, this version, um, no, not this version by the time, cause this version,
[01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:25.140]  I think is it coming up on two years?
[01:55:25.140 --> 01:55:26.140]  I think it's coming up.
[01:55:26.140 --> 01:55:30.820]  I mean like, like I'm off the top of my head, Syracuse, a guy, English, uh, straight tech
[01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:34.300]  or a guy like those, all three of those were really good episodes.
[01:55:34.300 --> 01:55:37.740]  They were really good talk show episodes and I bet not one of them was under two hours.
[01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:38.740]  No, no, no.
[01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:40.060]  Syracuse was over three hours.
[01:55:40.060 --> 01:55:41.060]  Yeah.
[01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:42.060]  Syracuse, it was like three Oh three.
[01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:44.740]  Um, those are all three and really good.
[01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:50.300]  And it was for, for, you know, and Dave Whiskas actually literally really does edit the show.
[01:55:50.300 --> 01:55:55.260]  And a lot of times the version that gets published is a little shorter than what is recorded.
[01:55:55.260 --> 01:56:02.460]  But uh, the Syracuse, this show we recorded the day before this Coco conference in Philly
[01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:03.900]  was going to happen.
[01:56:03.900 --> 01:56:08.240]  Coco love, which actually was a remarkably good, it was just a little 150 person indie
[01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:10.580]  Mac developer conference here in Philly.
[01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:12.340]  Um, it was really, really great.
[01:56:12.340 --> 01:56:15.220]  I can't believe it was the first instance of it.
[01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:16.220]  Oh, that's great.
[01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:20.100]  Cause it was, that's, that's great to hear, uh, that's still thriving.
[01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:24.820]  You know, I've been to first conferences and they're never, they're always, they're cool.
[01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:29.300]  Like the first Singleton was great, but like the second Singleton was way better because
[01:56:29.300 --> 01:56:32.220]  they had like, you know, they knew like 15 things to do better.
[01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:34.340]  They knew to get a better venue, everything.
[01:56:34.340 --> 01:56:37.340]  This Coco love conference, I can't believe it was the first one because it was like a
[01:56:37.340 --> 01:56:41.580]  really great venue and everything ran on time and really great.
[01:56:41.580 --> 01:56:47.620]  But anyway, Dave was speaking at it, uh, and Brent Simmons was flying in.
[01:56:47.620 --> 01:56:52.260]  So he needed, you know, he was going to spend, but I really wanted the show to come out that
[01:56:52.260 --> 01:56:53.280]  day, Friday.
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:56.860]  So Syracuse and I recorded knowing we better not screw up.
[01:56:56.860 --> 01:57:00.620]  Hopefully we won't, you know, we don't want to have any kind of necessary edits.
[01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:06.740]  Um, so three Oh three was like, that was, I don't think, I don't think Dave would have
[01:57:06.740 --> 01:57:10.220]  cut anything though, but we, you know, it was a very tight show.
[01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:11.220]  He's a, he's very compact.
[01:57:11.220 --> 01:57:16.180]  I mean, you'll remember that when he and Dan talked about, um, Goodfellas, I mean, it was
[01:57:16.180 --> 01:57:22.460]  an hour longer than the movie, crazy, but awesome.
[01:57:22.460 --> 01:57:26.940]  If there ever, if ever, you know, sir, I, I, it sounds crazy that your discussion of
[01:57:26.940 --> 01:57:30.380]  a movie would be longer than the movie, but if it happened, it happened with us.
[01:57:30.380 --> 01:57:33.680]  And um, what was the one we did, uh, Glengarry Glen Ross.
[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:35.340]  It's actually easier than you'd think.
[01:57:35.340 --> 01:57:36.340]  Yeah.
[01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:40.460]  Well, because you can, you know, if it's a real, if it's truly a good movie, there are
[01:57:40.460 --> 01:57:41.460]  details.
[01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:45.300]  There's little things that go by like this in the movie, you know, in a snap, but that
[01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:49.720]  if you really stop and think about are worth a lengthy discussion, especially if you're
[01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:53.500]  somebody like Syracuse with that movie or me with Glengarry Glen Ross, maybe, maybe
[01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:57.740]  like another one for me would be like big Lebowski or there's certain movies where it
[01:57:57.740 --> 01:57:58.740]  isn't just that I liked them.
[01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:00.380]  It isn't just that I think they're really good.
[01:58:00.380 --> 01:58:02.540]  It isn't just that I have things to say about them.
[01:58:02.540 --> 01:58:05.900]  It's just that there's so many things nobody's ever bothered to ask me about that.
[01:58:05.900 --> 01:58:07.900]  I thought, yeah, I know you're like this.
[01:58:07.900 --> 01:58:11.340]  There's so many things I've been thinking about about this thing for years that no one
[01:58:11.340 --> 01:58:12.340]  has ever asked me about.
[01:58:12.340 --> 01:58:15.520]  And this is the only chance in the entire world I'm going to get to talk about this
[01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:20.500]  unified field theory about like, you know, in your case, like single point perspective
[01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:23.420]  with Stanley Kubrick, like how many times will you get to talk about that?
[01:58:23.420 --> 01:58:27.660]  How many times do you get to talk about the way Steven Spielberg uses thirds of the screen?
[01:58:27.660 --> 01:58:30.100]  It's like, I'm probably the only person that ever noticed this, but like, I got a lot to
[01:58:30.100 --> 01:58:32.100]  say about it.
[01:58:32.100 --> 01:58:33.100]  Absolutely.
[01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:38.000]  You know, and like I said, rewind a little bit.
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:41.920]  In the early days, we used to get complaints when we'd go over an hour from some people.
[01:58:41.920 --> 01:58:48.460]  And I understood it because I totally see like, you know, and I don't want to be corny
[01:58:48.460 --> 01:58:54.180]  about this, but it is in a way that it's an honor that people read my stuff and read my
[01:58:54.180 --> 01:58:55.180]  writing.
[01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:59.680]  It's in some ways even more of an honor that people listen to this show or when I appear
[01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:02.260]  on other people's podcasts because it's even more of your time.
[01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:03.700]  It takes longer to listen to a podcast.
[01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:08.140]  You can just jump in and sip a little bit off of a 200 word blog post.
[01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:11.220]  I mean, if you're going to sit down to an interview, if you're going to tuck into a
[01:59:11.220 --> 01:59:13.860]  Syracuse interview, you better bring a sandwich.
[01:59:13.860 --> 01:59:16.380]  You really ask a lot of people.
[01:59:16.380 --> 01:59:20.880]  Jonas was just saying to me about how when he notices when he plays video games like
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:26.380]  Nintendo games and they put again, the cut scenes and the characters on screen talk and
[01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:32.660]  they put the subtitles underneath that he always reads them even though, you know, they're
[01:59:32.660 --> 01:59:33.660]  talking.
[01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:34.660]  And I said, you know why?
[01:59:34.660 --> 01:59:37.340]  I said, I do the same thing and I kind of don't like, and I said, you know why?
[01:59:37.340 --> 01:59:40.740]  I think it's because you read faster than you can listen and he's like, yeah, that's
[01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:41.740]  true.
[01:59:41.740 --> 01:59:44.520]  Like you've already read the dialogue before they're even halfway through the sentence
[01:59:44.520 --> 01:59:48.220]  and it's like, you know, so people can read during fireball way faster than they can listen
[01:59:48.220 --> 01:59:49.220]  to the show.
[01:59:49.220 --> 01:59:50.220]  So it's a real honor.
[01:59:50.220 --> 01:59:53.140]  And so when people would complain that the show is too long, I'd think, well, you know,
[01:59:53.140 --> 01:59:56.540]  you have a very good point because it's a privilege that you're giving me even an hour
[01:59:56.540 --> 01:59:59.500]  of your time, but I don't get any complaints anymore.
[01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:03.960]  I don't know if there are people out there listening right now who silently hate that
[02:00:03.960 --> 02:00:06.060]  this show has expanded in time.
[02:00:06.060 --> 02:00:10.380]  You should write to me and let me know because, you know, I'd be interested to know that.
[02:00:10.380 --> 02:00:14.620]  But what I've been hearing lately is people who love it, you know,
[02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:16.580]  My feelings on this have really evolved.
[02:00:16.580 --> 02:00:20.620]  I don't want to say I've gone full circle, but they've gone something very, very near
[02:00:20.620 --> 02:00:22.620]  to full circle.
[02:00:22.620 --> 02:00:27.420]  And the short version is, I think it depends a lot on what kind of show it is.
[02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:28.420]  You know, think about it.
[02:00:28.420 --> 02:00:30.900]  This, I mean, think about like, if you listen to like, I've just started listening to this
[02:00:30.900 --> 02:00:31.900]  show on slate.
[02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:35.300]  I think it's called a cultural gab fest and it's something like about a half hour long
[02:00:35.300 --> 02:00:39.420]  and I it's perfect, perfect in length because it's a, you know, it's almost like a radio
[02:00:39.420 --> 02:00:40.420]  show.
[02:00:40.420 --> 02:00:42.540]  It's like professional journalists talking in an organized way and it makes a lot of
[02:00:42.540 --> 02:00:46.920]  sense and you wouldn't want it to go on for four hours if it's a, if it's an, you know,
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:51.140]  part of the thing when you're listening to like, well, I'll be brave enough to toss myself
[02:00:51.140 --> 02:00:56.620]  in here, but like a show like this, a show like definitely ATP and I'll even say a show
[02:00:56.620 --> 02:00:59.740]  like Roderick on the line, you're there cause you want to see how this unfolds.
[02:00:59.740 --> 02:01:01.620]  You're not going to skip any of this.
[02:01:01.620 --> 02:01:04.740]  Like you want to see, here's where it started, what happens next?
[02:01:04.740 --> 02:01:06.380]  Where's it going to go from now?
[02:01:06.380 --> 02:01:07.380]  You know what I mean?
[02:01:07.380 --> 02:01:14.180]  And I think that's really different from the topic obsessed outline driven show that a
[02:01:14.180 --> 02:01:16.540]  lot of people have come up with that either can be very tight.
[02:01:16.540 --> 02:01:17.540]  So here's how my feelings evolved.
[02:01:17.540 --> 02:01:20.940]  I mean, the joke I used to make when I first started doing a podcast for 43 folders and
[02:01:20.940 --> 02:01:21.940]  something like 2005.
[02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:23.940]  So it was a pretty long time ago.
[02:01:23.940 --> 02:01:24.940]  That's a long time.
[02:01:24.940 --> 02:01:25.940]  Yeah.
[02:01:25.940 --> 02:01:26.940]  Yeah.
[02:01:26.940 --> 02:01:30.300]  So 2005, 2000 and then I started doing, you know, Mac break weekly, not too long after
[02:01:30.300 --> 02:01:31.300]  that.
[02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:35.340]  But anyhow, back then the joke I always made was like, nobody wants to listen to like three
[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:39.160]  guys talk about Unix for three hours because that's what podcasts used to seem like.
[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:40.720]  They were totally unedited.
[02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:43.880]  They were, I mean, I'm being very general here, but they were, they weren't edited.
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:45.820]  They weren't well recorded.
[02:01:45.820 --> 02:01:49.560]  And a lot of times it was people who were not used to having heard what their voice
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:52.340]  sounds like for a long time and they would just drone on and on.
[02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:56.180]  And so for me at first it was like the 43 floors podcast.
[02:01:56.180 --> 02:01:59.820]  Like it was rarely more than like seven or eight minutes because I had internalized that.
[02:01:59.820 --> 02:02:01.660]  Like that's how long this should be.
[02:02:01.660 --> 02:02:04.960]  People are going to put what puts on their iPod, I guess that's a big file.
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:05.960]  Keep these small.
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:07.100]  That changed a little bit over time.
[02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:08.420]  Like you look nice today.
[02:02:08.420 --> 02:02:11.620]  I don't know if there's any look nice today is that are longer than an hour.
[02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:13.260]  They're usually like 35 minutes.
[02:02:13.260 --> 02:02:14.260]  Yeah.
[02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:18.320]  That was, it was very sitcom like I went and listened to it for the first time in a long
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:22.280]  time, went and listened to one the other day for election day was that who voted and went
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:23.900]  back and listened to that one.
[02:02:23.900 --> 02:02:25.940]  And I cannot believe how fast it went by.
[02:02:25.940 --> 02:02:27.460]  I was like, that was it.
[02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:31.480]  Like I'm just settling in for the first sponsor break on talk show by this point, you know,
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:36.520]  but now today I have to say a show like yours, like I don't find myself checking my watch
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:41.140]  or you know, a show like, um, what's the prompt called now connected shows like that shows
[02:02:41.140 --> 02:02:44.820]  like ATP, ATP give me two hours long and I'm totally fine with it.
[02:02:44.820 --> 02:02:48.420]  I'm just there to listen for however long it is at normal speed.
[02:02:48.420 --> 02:02:53.820]  I do the overcast thing where I do the automatically, you know, clip out pauses part, but I never
[02:02:53.820 --> 02:02:56.180]  listened it artificially high speeds.
[02:02:56.180 --> 02:02:57.980]  Oh, you don't pump it up a little bit.
[02:02:57.980 --> 02:03:00.740]  I pump it up a little bit like a 1.1 and 1.5.
[02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:01.740]  Yeah.
[02:03:01.740 --> 02:03:02.740]  Like a 1.2 or so.
[02:03:02.740 --> 02:03:08.980]  Let's podcast end up being about 1.1 or so I think with, um, overcast, but yeah, you
[02:03:08.980 --> 02:03:10.700]  know, if you get used to it, it's no problem.
[02:03:10.700 --> 02:03:14.260]  But certain shows where there's lots of music, I turn that off cause that drives me crazy.
[02:03:14.260 --> 02:03:18.380]  I'm not, I'm not like an audio file, but anyway, all I'm saying is bottom line, yes, it has
[02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:19.380]  changed a lot.
[02:03:19.380 --> 02:03:20.380]  I think for almost everybody.
[02:03:20.380 --> 02:03:24.420]  Um, if people like your show and they, I mean, we used to hear this on Mac break weekly and
[02:03:24.420 --> 02:03:28.820]  frankly at that time it drove me nuts because they'd be like, Oh, cause once it got to like
[02:03:28.820 --> 02:03:32.740]  an hour, hour and 15 minutes, I'd be like, I've really got to pee and the show is getting
[02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:33.740]  way too long.
[02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:37.780]  But people would be like, Oh God, please record everything from every second that you're ever
[02:03:37.780 --> 02:03:38.780]  on the air and put it out.
[02:03:38.780 --> 02:03:40.380]  And I was like, you've got to be kidding me.
[02:03:40.380 --> 02:03:43.440]  Like after you've worked without a Melissa Gore, that is, that is a state of mind that's
[02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:49.140]  kind of hard to grok, but you know, I honestly, I mean, you, you're not a huge podcast listener,
[02:03:49.140 --> 02:03:50.140]  are you?
[02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:56.340]  No, because I think there's so many that I, I like, but I just don't have the time in
[02:03:56.340 --> 02:03:58.340]  my week and that's cause I don't, I don't commute.
[02:03:58.340 --> 02:03:59.340]  You go to Vegas a lot.
[02:03:59.340 --> 02:04:04.620]  That's yeah, but how would that help me with podcasts point, but, uh, but they all, they
[02:04:04.620 --> 02:04:09.020]  can be very time consuming and if you want to jump in something like the flop house,
[02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:11.580]  you know, to fully appreciate the flop house, you've got to really go back and listen for
[02:04:11.580 --> 02:04:15.580]  Roderick on the line, if I could say it pays to go back and listen from a ways back.
[02:04:15.580 --> 02:04:18.660]  But even with a new show, you get two shows that are two hours a week.
[02:04:18.660 --> 02:04:20.700]  I mean, that's half a workday.
[02:04:20.700 --> 02:04:27.260]  No people, I have no hesitation letting you put Roderick on the line out there as an example
[02:04:27.260 --> 02:04:28.260]  of that.
[02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:31.940]  This type of show that people, the people who love that, like that show, love that show.
[02:04:31.940 --> 02:04:37.660]  Like I always see people say like, it's a common thing on Twitter where if there's somebody
[02:04:37.660 --> 02:04:42.980]  who's on this show, you know, my show that they really like, they'll say, I would love
[02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:47.500]  a Roderick on the line style show between you and insert that person every week.
[02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:48.500]  Wow.
[02:04:48.500 --> 02:04:49.740]  That's such a huge compliment.
[02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:54.340]  Like the people who most like, I, somebody said it was Syracuse with the last episode,
[02:04:54.340 --> 02:04:58.900]  but I see, you know, other people like it when, you know, Joanna Stern is on with me
[02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:02.060]  or show, man, she's so good.
[02:05:02.060 --> 02:05:05.980]  Um, but we, and we do, I do, I always think when I record with her, I think, man, we have
[02:05:05.980 --> 02:05:08.060]  a pretty good chemistry on the show together.
[02:05:08.060 --> 02:05:12.720]  Um, but people will say like, I would just love like a Roderick on the line style show.
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:15.860]  Like it's a, uh, a style, you know, it is a thing.
[02:05:15.860 --> 02:05:16.860]  Wow.
[02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:17.860]  That's really cool.
[02:05:17.860 --> 02:05:20.820]  I had noticed that I had gotten that with, you look nice today in the past because I
[02:05:20.820 --> 02:05:24.820]  think we really were one of the genre defining three white guys talking about nothing shows.
[02:05:24.820 --> 02:05:25.820]  Right.
[02:05:25.820 --> 02:05:29.980]  But, uh, but no, it was funny though, because, well, the, the, the, the editing aesthetic
[02:05:29.980 --> 02:05:32.940]  of you look nice today and that show was super tightly edited.
[02:05:32.940 --> 02:05:35.180]  I mean, it was like ridiculously, ridiculously edited.
[02:05:35.180 --> 02:05:36.180]  Yeah.
[02:05:36.180 --> 02:05:37.180]  Right.
[02:05:37.180 --> 02:05:38.180]  Like behind the scenes.
[02:05:38.180 --> 02:05:44.020]  It was like, like going into like the dark room and it's, there's thousands of strips
[02:05:44.020 --> 02:05:49.900]  of film all over the floor and you know, you know, I guess Adam used to do a lot of the
[02:05:49.900 --> 02:05:50.900]  editing originally.
[02:05:50.900 --> 02:05:51.900]  No, Adam was the editor.
[02:05:51.900 --> 02:05:54.860]  I mean, until he got super busy at the end, he always edit it.
[02:05:54.860 --> 02:05:58.660]  It wasn't until the show came back that Claude was doing it, but it was always Adam.
[02:05:58.660 --> 02:06:00.220]  He would, nobody else would touch it.
[02:06:00.220 --> 02:06:01.220]  All right.
[02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:07.540]  And the thing that Adam would come out with was this 35 minute thing that sounded as though
[02:06:07.540 --> 02:06:09.420]  it was scripted.
[02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:12.620]  A lot of people thought a lot of people were like, how do you guys, do you guys write together?
[02:06:12.620 --> 02:06:13.620]  Do you use Google docs?
[02:06:13.620 --> 02:06:14.620]  Right.
[02:06:14.620 --> 02:06:15.620]  Are you kidding me?
[02:06:15.620 --> 02:06:18.860]  Estelle Getty playing, playing testicles.
[02:06:18.860 --> 02:06:27.260]  I mean like you think we wrote that it, but it also, it, it did feel, yeah, it felt written,
[02:06:27.260 --> 02:06:29.860]  but yet also felt so easy.
[02:06:29.860 --> 02:06:35.900]  You know, there was an easiness to, it felt like you guys could just sit down and in 40
[02:06:35.900 --> 02:06:38.980]  minutes come up with a 35 minute, you look nice today.
[02:06:38.980 --> 02:06:39.980]  Just right off the cuff.
[02:06:39.980 --> 02:06:40.980]  Yeah.
[02:06:40.980 --> 02:06:43.820]  And that's just, I appreciate you saying that and it's, you know, so much of it was Adam's
[02:06:43.820 --> 02:06:44.820]  work.
[02:06:44.820 --> 02:06:49.700]  And you know, I would go back and um, I didn't do this, I guess most of the time I would
[02:06:49.700 --> 02:06:53.480]  listen to the raw version and then listen to the edited version, especially later on.
[02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:55.900]  And it's amazing cause he would take stuff and change the order of it.
[02:06:55.900 --> 02:06:57.940]  He would duck stuff so that we weren't talking over each other.
[02:06:57.940 --> 02:07:01.140]  And I guess everybody, all the Jason Snells of the world, I mean, can you believe Jason
[02:07:01.140 --> 02:07:02.140]  Snell?
[02:07:02.140 --> 02:07:04.040]  Like, can you believe how many things or Dave for that matter?
[02:07:04.040 --> 02:07:06.460]  Like can you imagine sitting there and having to listen to this bullshit and then have to
[02:07:06.460 --> 02:07:10.460]  figure out where to duck like, yeah, I can't, I would never do that in a million years.
[02:07:10.460 --> 02:07:12.900]  So it would drive me completely crazy, but I don't want to do that.
[02:07:12.900 --> 02:07:15.740]  And then you go, well, here's a place where we could drop in some music or a sound cue
[02:07:15.740 --> 02:07:16.740]  or something.
[02:07:16.740 --> 02:07:21.980]  And you know, it really, it, you know, I think there's, especially as the show went on, not
[02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:27.940]  to reminisce, but it got, we now, once we heard, heard our own show edited, it became
[02:07:27.940 --> 02:07:31.280]  clear what show to do while we were recording it, which sounds silly.
[02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:35.360]  But like, I think they probably needed strictly speaking, less editing as we went, but that
[02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:39.100]  just gave out a more fuel to like, you know, make something interesting out of it.
[02:07:39.100 --> 02:07:40.100]  Right.
[02:07:40.100 --> 02:07:45.580]  But I, yeah, I, one of my theories on why the long shows, longer shows are getting more
[02:07:45.580 --> 02:07:53.180]  palatable is that, um, people are better able to listen wherever, whenever.
[02:07:53.180 --> 02:07:54.180]  Right.
[02:07:54.180 --> 02:07:58.700]  Like we didn't have, you know, when you say, you know, what was the show you started in
[02:07:58.700 --> 02:07:59.700]  2005?
[02:07:59.700 --> 02:08:01.660]  There's 43 folders and then Mac break weekly.
[02:08:01.660 --> 02:08:02.660]  Right.
[02:08:02.660 --> 02:08:07.340]  So there weren't, you didn't even have a phone that could play podcasts, right?
[02:08:07.340 --> 02:08:10.900]  Let alone an eight gigabyte phone that you could easily fill up with space.
[02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:13.900]  It was like filling a grocery bag that you then had to carry around all day.
[02:08:13.900 --> 02:08:18.700]  It was, it was an effort even with the iPod pet iPod, there was still a fair amount of
[02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:24.660]  effort to keeping that up to date and you know, now you could run out of like who puts
[02:08:24.660 --> 02:08:27.800]  like I, when I go in and I have to clear out space, I always go in and start with something
[02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:31.780]  like instacast or overcast because I have four gigs of audio files in there.
[02:08:31.780 --> 02:08:32.780]  Right.
[02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:33.780]  I mean, think about that.
[02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:35.360]  Think about how crazy that is.
[02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:39.380]  And like back then that was, you know, substantial part of your, your iPod could be filled up
[02:08:39.380 --> 02:08:40.380]  in no time.
[02:08:40.380 --> 02:08:42.560]  So yeah, you're right.
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:44.700]  And you know, it's, it's commuting.
[02:08:44.700 --> 02:08:49.100]  It's people who take trains and use headphones and people with cars that have some sort of
[02:08:49.100 --> 02:08:50.900]  Bluetooth, you know, connectivity.
[02:08:50.900 --> 02:08:57.000]  So, you know, you load up your overcast with a bunch of shows and they're always there.
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:00.260]  You don't have to do the stupid thing where you have to download it to your computer first
[02:09:00.260 --> 02:09:01.260]  and then plug your phone into it.
[02:09:01.260 --> 02:09:04.740]  Yeah, I gotta say that untethering from iTunes is huge.
[02:09:04.740 --> 02:09:05.860]  It's absolutely huge.
[02:09:05.860 --> 02:09:06.860]  It's actually-
[02:09:06.860 --> 02:09:10.740]  I think that's one of the most fundamental things that changed iOS was when you did not
[02:09:10.740 --> 02:09:12.880]  have to be hooked up to a Mac.
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:18.820]  It seems like a feature improvement in retrospect, but like to me in retrospect, like that's
[02:09:18.820 --> 02:09:21.840]  when everything changed is when you can do everything over the air.
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:28.140]  I think it's largely responsible for the fact that podcasts are like a real part of my career
[02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:29.140]  now.
[02:09:29.140 --> 02:09:35.020]  I mean, there's like a significant portion of what I make it during Fireball comes from
[02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:36.280]  this show.
[02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:44.280]  And I think it's entirely directly corresponds to when iPhones got untethered from the computer
[02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:45.280]  when they became full-
[02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:50.420]  And the Venn diagram of that, podcasts growing, interest in doing Fireball, yeah, it's interesting
[02:09:50.420 --> 02:09:52.980]  that your timing is good for that.
[02:09:52.980 --> 02:09:53.980]  Yeah.
[02:09:53.980 --> 02:09:58.020]  And I think that's also why the longer shows are seemingly palatable.
[02:09:58.020 --> 02:10:00.500]  Maybe the people who hate them have given up and stopped listening, I don't know.
[02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:02.620]  But I think it's because you always have it with you.
[02:10:02.620 --> 02:10:06.120]  And even if you don't have a two-hour chunk to listen to this all at once, you just listen
[02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:08.180]  to the hour, first hour.
[02:10:08.180 --> 02:10:13.660]  It's like one time when Marco was on a couple months ago, it went real crazy long like this
[02:10:13.660 --> 02:10:14.660]  over two hours.
[02:10:14.660 --> 02:10:16.420]  And so I literally broke it up into two episodes.
[02:10:16.420 --> 02:10:17.820]  Oh God, I remember that.
[02:10:17.820 --> 02:10:18.820]  That was with Overcast.
[02:10:18.820 --> 02:10:19.820]  That was when he put out Overcast.
[02:10:19.820 --> 02:10:20.820]  Yeah.
[02:10:20.820 --> 02:10:21.820]  That's right.
[02:10:21.820 --> 02:10:22.820]  You had like four hours.
[02:10:22.820 --> 02:10:23.820]  Right.
[02:10:23.820 --> 02:10:26.780]  I think it was like four hours.
[02:10:26.780 --> 02:10:34.300]  I think it had to be broken up, but it helped because I was behind on the sponsor things
[02:10:34.300 --> 02:10:36.500]  and more on that in a second.
[02:10:36.500 --> 02:10:39.680]  But I'd fallen behind the schedule.
[02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:40.680]  And it just, I don't know, just something.
[02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:42.420]  You were behind in the sponsor count?
[02:10:42.420 --> 02:10:43.420]  Yeah.
[02:10:43.420 --> 02:10:46.860]  Well, it's because I don't have a regular.
[02:10:46.860 --> 02:10:47.860]  That's the other thing too.
[02:10:47.860 --> 02:10:49.340]  I mean, it probably would help if I got more regular.
[02:10:49.340 --> 02:10:54.420]  I used to try to record every Thursday, which is what we're doing this week.
[02:10:54.420 --> 02:11:00.100]  But no matter what I do, it seems like I never record more than 40 episodes a year.
[02:11:00.100 --> 02:11:03.060]  Like in theory, I would do 52.
[02:11:03.060 --> 02:11:06.660]  But it's pretty consistent that it comes out to 40.
[02:11:06.660 --> 02:11:12.420]  Because sometimes I just, for a show that I don't really prepare for, I just come and
[02:11:12.420 --> 02:11:13.420]  do it.
[02:11:13.420 --> 02:11:14.420]  I find it mentally exhausting.
[02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:17.260]  Like by the time I'm done talking to you here, I'm going to be spent.
[02:11:17.260 --> 02:11:18.620]  That's the thing we're not allowed to say.
[02:11:18.620 --> 02:11:19.620]  I feel the same way.
[02:11:19.620 --> 02:11:23.820]  I can't believe I feel tired after recording a podcast sometimes.
[02:11:23.820 --> 02:11:24.820]  Right.
[02:11:24.820 --> 02:11:26.140]  And I've told you this before.
[02:11:26.140 --> 02:11:31.220]  My mother's father was a coal miner.
[02:11:31.220 --> 02:11:32.220]  He is a coal miner.
[02:11:32.220 --> 02:11:34.460]  He worked in a black hole.
[02:11:34.460 --> 02:11:36.180]  And he died.
[02:11:36.180 --> 02:11:39.660]  He died of a disease called black lung.
[02:11:39.660 --> 02:11:41.860]  Like at the age of 70, he died of black lung.
[02:11:41.860 --> 02:11:44.740]  He had to talk about computers for two hours.
[02:11:44.740 --> 02:11:46.020]  Right.
[02:11:46.020 --> 02:11:47.500]  But I remember.
[02:11:47.500 --> 02:11:48.500]  You know what though?
[02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:49.500]  But I remember him.
[02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:51.700]  He was a very kind man.
[02:11:51.700 --> 02:11:54.940]  And I was only in first grade when he died.
[02:11:54.940 --> 02:11:58.380]  But he was everything you'd ever want in a pop pop.
[02:11:58.380 --> 02:12:04.620]  He always had like a secret stash of cookies that he let on that only I knew.
[02:12:04.620 --> 02:12:07.300]  My mom and dad didn't have to know that I knew where he kept them.
[02:12:07.300 --> 02:12:09.180]  Oh, that's a good pop pop.
[02:12:09.180 --> 02:12:10.180]  Yeah.
[02:12:10.180 --> 02:12:12.100]  Pepperidge Farm sugar cookies.
[02:12:12.100 --> 02:12:14.460]  Which is what a great name for cookies.
[02:12:14.460 --> 02:12:16.460]  Sugar cookies.
[02:12:16.460 --> 02:12:18.580]  Let's not sugar cook this.
[02:12:18.580 --> 02:12:20.380]  No actually let's go ahead and sugar cook this.
[02:12:20.380 --> 02:12:22.020]  This is literally sugar cookies.
[02:12:22.020 --> 02:12:23.020]  Right.
[02:12:23.020 --> 02:12:28.180]  But this is me complaining about how exhausting it is to talk to one of my best and dearest
[02:12:28.180 --> 02:12:31.540]  friends for two hours in Skype.
[02:12:31.540 --> 02:12:38.140]  And you know I'm two generations removed from a man who went into a dangerous dark black
[02:12:38.140 --> 02:12:39.140]  hole.
[02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:40.140]  He breathed black dust.
[02:12:40.140 --> 02:12:41.140]  Right.
[02:12:41.140 --> 02:12:42.860]  Oh my God.
[02:12:42.860 --> 02:12:45.980]  Breathing black dust that would eventually kill him at a fairly early age.
[02:12:45.980 --> 02:12:48.180]  You don't even edit the show.
[02:12:48.180 --> 02:12:51.220]  I don't even edit the show as Dave Whiskus does.
[02:12:51.220 --> 02:12:55.220]  And I'm complaining here for everybody about how hard it is.
[02:12:55.220 --> 02:12:56.220]  But I do.
[02:12:56.220 --> 02:12:57.220]  I find it.
[02:12:57.220 --> 02:12:58.220]  I mean it does.
[02:12:58.220 --> 02:13:02.020]  It gives me an enormous amount of respect for professional broadcasters like a Howard
[02:13:02.020 --> 02:13:04.660]  Stern who do it every freaking day.
[02:13:04.660 --> 02:13:06.940]  Oh and like every four hours, six hours a day.
[02:13:06.940 --> 02:13:07.940]  Can you believe that?
[02:13:07.940 --> 02:13:08.940]  Yeah.
[02:13:08.940 --> 02:13:09.940]  I cannot believe it.
[02:13:09.940 --> 02:13:10.940]  I see.
[02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:15.360]  I feel like that way with Morning Edition where you know Morning Edition starts.
[02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:16.980]  You guys get it starting at six in the morning.
[02:13:16.980 --> 02:13:19.100]  It starts running here at three in the morning.
[02:13:19.100 --> 02:13:22.420]  So to get into the studio I mean those guys are getting what two three in the morning
[02:13:22.420 --> 02:13:23.860]  to record that show.
[02:13:23.860 --> 02:13:25.940]  Can you imagine doing that every day for like years?
[02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:27.420]  For a career.
[02:13:27.420 --> 02:13:28.420]  It's ridiculous.
[02:13:28.420 --> 02:13:32.660]  Well you know I've been trying to figure out the chicken and egg of this.
[02:13:32.660 --> 02:13:33.660]  Am I interrupting here?
[02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:34.660]  Were you going to do a?
[02:13:34.660 --> 02:13:35.660]  No.
[02:13:35.660 --> 02:13:36.660]  No.
[02:13:36.660 --> 02:13:42.540]  Because I was sitting here waiting for your cable to get fixed and thinking about you
[02:13:42.540 --> 02:13:46.940]  know how strange it is the way the if you like ecosystem has changed.
[02:13:46.940 --> 02:13:51.020]  Where you know I used to feel like I really understood like what was going on in the world
[02:13:51.020 --> 02:13:55.260]  of consumer technology especially as it related to media right.
[02:13:55.260 --> 02:13:57.900]  Up until like you know I used to feel like I was really on top of that stuff.
[02:13:57.900 --> 02:14:01.560]  I've done some work with companies like even like small record labels and stuff talking
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:05.820]  about hey here's how to really guys you're you're facing up against Myspace here you're
[02:14:05.820 --> 02:14:07.940]  facing up against Kazaa here.
[02:14:07.940 --> 02:14:11.220]  Here's the things to think about you know in terms of you know having a strategy that
[02:14:11.220 --> 02:14:15.620]  works for for moving beyond being in a Sam Goody because that was a conversation that
[02:14:15.620 --> 02:14:19.660]  really needed to be had and a lot of people didn't want to have that conversation.
[02:14:19.660 --> 02:14:22.020]  What's funny is though like for me I was that guy.
[02:14:22.020 --> 02:14:25.060]  I was the internet guy for years going oh you're going to have to put out you got to
[02:14:25.060 --> 02:14:29.220]  put out high quality mp3s of your stuff and no DRM and that didn't happen for a really
[02:14:29.220 --> 02:14:36.900]  long time and then suddenly Apple was selling no DRM mp3s and I was like haha see I was right
[02:14:36.900 --> 02:14:42.060]  all along and how long ago was that was that like maybe four years ago three years ago.
[02:14:42.060 --> 02:14:43.300]  Had to be longer than that.
[02:14:43.300 --> 02:14:49.380]  But like what did they start selling like just pure mp3s with no DRM when was that?
[02:14:49.380 --> 02:14:53.840]  Let's even say six years ago whatever it was and then I guess I went into a long winter's
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:57.180]  nap because then I woke up and I started seeing the numbers.
[02:14:57.180 --> 02:15:00.420]  Like so okay so first of all so then they start doing that then they become what the
[02:15:00.420 --> 02:15:03.580]  largest retailer music retailer in America for a while right.
[02:15:03.580 --> 02:15:10.300]  Wasn't that the case then the IT store yeah no and I'm at the store but but you have you
[02:15:10.300 --> 02:15:12.540]  watched those trend lines.
[02:15:12.540 --> 02:15:17.080]  It's crazy like I was here I was being Mr. Futurist guy where all you got to do is go
[02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:21.520]  sell your stuff on the internet but like I can't believe how long it took to go from
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:27.420]  that juggernaut to now watching that that line go down and now as you wake up and suddenly
[02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:31.740]  everybody wants streaming and I've just I don't know I've been kind of running over
[02:15:31.740 --> 02:15:34.900]  my mind going like where was I was I just did that happen when my daughter was young
[02:15:34.900 --> 02:15:40.640]  and I just missed it but it really seems like it so quickly went from it was this long tortured
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:45.740]  slide from like the late 90s you know Napster Kazaa what have you up to the point of selling
[02:15:45.740 --> 02:15:49.420]  stuff online that seemed like it took forever but in my head it feels like it's been the
[02:15:49.420 --> 02:15:54.300]  blink of an eye that's really started to go away quickly yeah do you know what I mean
[02:15:54.300 --> 02:15:57.200]  and the only reason I mentioned no it's like I'm trying to think about my own consumption
[02:15:57.200 --> 02:16:02.220]  of stuff we're like you know again how long was it ago that we got the iTunes match what
[02:16:02.220 --> 02:16:08.620]  couple three years ago by a couple years ago yeah because Steve Jobs was still a lot recently
[02:16:08.620 --> 02:16:13.780]  as the last two years I've been still been sitting there with music brains like making
[02:16:13.780 --> 02:16:17.300]  sure I get the right mp3 data in there to get everything synced up I can get the high
[02:16:17.300 --> 02:16:23.120]  quality version and but like at some point I stopped sweating that as much I was buying
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:28.420]  less I was downloading less and I was listening to a lot more podcasts and so I've been trying
[02:16:28.420 --> 02:16:32.620]  to I almost feel like I've had this last weekend where I'm trying to figure out where it went
[02:16:32.620 --> 02:16:36.780]  that I spend most of my time listening to podcasts because I was absolutely not the
[02:16:36.780 --> 02:16:41.300]  case even like five years ago I would listen to music all day long or even listen to radio
[02:16:41.300 --> 02:16:45.580]  all day long I don't know I'm not saying and the reason I say chicken and egg I'm not saying
[02:16:45.580 --> 02:16:49.940]  that podcast listening is what's causing that to change but I wonder how much of a factor
[02:16:49.940 --> 02:16:53.980]  that is at least amongst people like us because the less we buy music the less we talk about
[02:16:53.980 --> 02:16:57.880]  music maybe it's because we're getting older but I don't know I really feel like there's
[02:16:57.880 --> 02:17:03.540]  still a there's just a huge change underway right now I was thinking about it with this
[02:17:03.540 --> 02:17:09.520]  the way that that streaming is clearly the future and say you know to buy buying music
[02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:15.300]  is over the last feels kind of over yeah the last platform for buying we I got caught up
[02:17:15.300 --> 02:17:19.920]  in it too where I thought that the way the music industry worked was every decade or
[02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:25.600]  so a new format comes along and instead of buying vinyl now you buy cassette tapes like
[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:31.100]  when my teenage years was where it was the 80s and that's that was the cassette era I
[02:17:31.100 --> 02:17:35.940]  had all of my all of my money was tied up in cassette tapes and then the 90s came with
[02:17:35.940 --> 02:17:40.380]  CDs and it kind of sucked because I had I actually did I did the thing that the music
[02:17:40.380 --> 02:17:46.740]  industry you know loves is I'm re-bought music on CD because I wanted it on CD because it
[02:17:46.740 --> 02:17:51.260]  was more convenient you could you could you could sort of blind yourself to the ridiculous
[02:17:51.260 --> 02:17:57.040]  cost of that back then it was what 12 13 bucks for a CD yeah you get to the you could blind
[02:17:57.040 --> 02:18:01.320]  yourself to that by saying well okay on the one hand the quality of this right straight
[02:18:01.320 --> 02:18:06.060]  out of the box is gonna be like twice or three times as good however you perceive it like
[02:18:06.060 --> 02:18:10.660]  the quality is gonna be so much better and I now I'm never gonna have to do this again
[02:18:10.660 --> 02:18:14.700]  because this yeah this will be a you know perfect sound forever this this CD will last
[02:18:14.700 --> 02:18:19.020]  in in exactly the sound exactly the same for the next hundred years right it's never gonna
[02:18:19.020 --> 02:18:25.180]  wear out etc etc and then you know digital came and it was clear that you know oh even
[02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:28.000]  better it's you just download and you don't have to worry about keeping track of all these
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:31.780]  discs and nobody can never nobody's you're never gonna lose the disc again remember when
[02:18:31.780 --> 02:18:36.700]  you'd really be in the mood to listen to something about this you and I you you it's like I really
[02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:40.220]  you know what I really say you re-bought Tom Petty I've re-bought Weezer because I didn't
[02:18:40.220 --> 02:18:46.420]  want to go in the other room I would go and get like I'm in the mood for Led Zeppelin
[02:18:46.420 --> 02:18:50.900]  4 like so when you want Led Zeppelin 4 you got to have it and I'd go get the disc and
[02:18:50.900 --> 02:18:55.820]  or the box I have the box set open it up and the disc isn't in the sleeve it's like ah
[02:18:55.820 --> 02:19:02.420]  where is it well guess what I'll go buy it again you know what I mean it's clear I and
[02:19:02.420 --> 02:19:05.640]  I just figured that this would be the way it would be whereas clearly it's just going
[02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:10.300]  to streaming but then I think back to my teenage years too is I spent a ton of time tons of
[02:19:10.300 --> 02:19:17.180]  time listening to FM radio you know it feels like such anything beyond public radio or
[02:19:17.180 --> 02:19:22.900]  occasionally baseball but like um boy just you remember send a regular radio feels really
[02:19:22.900 --> 02:19:27.740]  foreign to me it feels like a parody of radio listen to it today yeah yeah it doesn't feel
[02:19:27.740 --> 02:19:31.140]  like the real radio anymore it's just all it's like this it's sort of like if you don't
[02:19:31.140 --> 02:19:35.260]  watch TV in the afternoon for a while and then you watch TV in the afternoon you're
[02:19:35.260 --> 02:19:42.140]  like who are these poor people oh my god you know it's all human tragedy I did that yesterday
[02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:48.580]  I don't know why I don't even know what it's all like lawsuits and like medical devices
[02:19:48.580 --> 02:19:52.060]  and you can buy needles they have needles delivered to your house have you ever seen
[02:19:52.060 --> 02:20:01.020]  the TMZ show I swear to god this is your homework everybody listening everybody listening out
[02:20:01.020 --> 02:20:06.720]  there all of you Merlin man you include that I swear to god go to your TiVo and have it
[02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:11.700]  set don't don't don't subscribe just have it record one episode like tomorrow like the
[02:20:11.700 --> 02:20:17.220]  Friday afternoon episode of TMZ here's the show it's a half an hour I think it's half
[02:20:17.220 --> 02:20:21.180]  an hour I don't know maybe it's even more it's it's just a couple of guys in the camera
[02:20:21.180 --> 02:20:28.300]  shot with cameras in the TMZ newsroom they've got to be in LA I don't know but if they're
[02:20:28.300 --> 02:20:33.420]  not in LA it's I'd be shocked so they're in LA they have a newsroom and they have maybe
[02:20:33.420 --> 02:20:40.900]  40 or 50 employees and they're just talking about the stuff that's going to be on TMZ
[02:20:40.900 --> 02:20:47.140]  on the website I guess it's you know just celebrity gossip and then they and they just
[02:20:47.140 --> 02:20:52.920]  make but it's all it's mostly scandalous it's not like yeah carpet oh it's all see on ET
[02:20:52.920 --> 02:20:57.660]  this is more like scandalous stuff yeah and they just it's and they just sit there and
[02:20:57.660 --> 02:21:03.020]  make fun of people first first let me see a car ad with that little just creepy little
[02:21:03.020 --> 02:21:09.060]  general guy more oh and the commercials the commercials are the commercials oh yeah so
[02:21:09.060 --> 02:21:12.940]  the content sure I mean the judge shows well that's but the commercials are the worst and
[02:21:12.940 --> 02:21:19.580]  that's what I get when I listen to the most radio it's it's so gross what was the what
[02:21:19.580 --> 02:21:22.660]  was the point of all that it's just you know like you're just describing they're like yeah
[02:21:22.660 --> 02:21:26.860]  it seems like every decade everything would change and then you know and then by the 90s
[02:21:26.860 --> 02:21:30.060]  it seemed like it was really settling down into the early 2000s you know what's amazing
[02:21:30.060 --> 02:21:35.520]  for me was ironically enough of course it was on one of my wackadoodle devices like
[02:21:35.520 --> 02:21:42.300]  probably the Amazon Fire TV which is easily my runaway favorite entertainment device right
[02:21:42.300 --> 02:21:46.580]  now I went in and looked at like you know Amazon at some point did that thing where
[02:21:46.580 --> 02:21:51.620]  any seed most of the CDs you bought they kind of grandfathered you into an electronic copy
[02:21:51.620 --> 02:21:56.660]  you know about this yeah you don't have to buy the mp3 version if you bought the CD they
[02:21:56.660 --> 02:22:00.500]  had some kind of deal where basically if you'd bought the CD in your locker or whatever you
[02:22:00.500 --> 02:22:05.900]  would have all of your old files and I I still think that that's what they should do with
[02:22:05.900 --> 02:22:11.780]  ebooks oh god I wish I've that would change everything for me if they did that I would
[02:22:11.780 --> 02:22:16.540]  it's it's either too costly or acrobatic to do ebooks right now I can do it and spend
[02:22:16.540 --> 02:22:21.580]  a lot of money or I can do it and run a lot of Python but it's it's just it's such a pain
[02:22:21.580 --> 02:22:27.840]  for the experience of justified text but I want the paper book oh I hear you I hear you
[02:22:27.840 --> 02:22:30.940]  I wish they would do that well but anyway the thing is like going to open that up I'm
[02:22:30.940 --> 02:22:36.540]  like oh my god I don't remember buying like half of these albums and so many of the albums
[02:22:36.540 --> 02:22:43.720]  are from the early mid 2000s so like 2002 2005 and you could even see at that point
[02:22:43.720 --> 02:22:48.060]  so many of the songs that are in my locker represent CDs that I bought as a quarter of
[02:22:48.060 --> 02:22:51.660]  last resort where like every one of these artists I can see the eye rolling that went
[02:22:51.660 --> 02:22:55.540]  through my mind where I was like okay they're not gonna have this at a store yeah I'm gonna
[02:22:55.540 --> 02:22:59.220]  I'm gonna I'm not gonna be able to download this from somewhere if I want this you know
[02:22:59.220 --> 02:23:04.700]  fairport convention album I'm gonna have to buy this CD and I got it I took it out I ripped
[02:23:04.700 --> 02:23:08.640]  it and then the CD went into a pile and now all those ghosts are coming back to me and
[02:23:08.640 --> 02:23:13.120]  it's so strange to see that transition I can't tell you the last time I bought a CD I mean
[02:23:13.120 --> 02:23:18.500]  do you remember the last time you bought a CD no it's I don't even know where to go to
[02:23:18.500 --> 02:23:24.700]  get a CD at this point apart from Amazon I saw Amy bought one Amy bought one might have
[02:23:24.700 --> 02:23:30.680]  been the new Tom Petty album maybe she didn't even buy it though maybe she's in like this
[02:23:30.680 --> 02:23:36.820]  like a fan club so she can get like stuff like that and maybe they just sent it to her
[02:23:36.820 --> 02:23:40.780]  maybe they did I think that maybe maybe because she's pays an annual fee to be in the fan
[02:23:40.780 --> 02:23:44.700]  club they sent her the CD I don't know it's strange though you talk about you know I even
[02:23:44.700 --> 02:23:49.160]  remember in like really starting especially in the mid to late 90s I guess the box sets
[02:23:49.160 --> 02:23:53.140]  right you're gonna really appeal to the collectors so the dinglings like you and me we're not
[02:23:53.140 --> 02:23:57.060]  only gonna have all these albums never gonna re-buy them because they're remastered and
[02:23:57.060 --> 02:24:01.740]  come with a booklet and they and they and it comes with a booklet yeah sure a special
[02:24:01.740 --> 02:24:07.180]  a special version tracks isolated vocals you know and some of those are great the Beach
[02:24:07.180 --> 02:24:12.420]  Boys one Led Zeppelin oh Led Zeppelin one's pretty good huh Led Zeppelin one is excellent
[02:24:12.420 --> 02:24:16.220]  uh the police one was pretty good I remember the police sounded like homemade shit when
[02:24:16.220 --> 02:24:21.220]  they when the CDs first came out I remember in particular they really what very first
[02:24:21.220 --> 02:24:25.700]  hearing like at Lando's D'Amour it sounded like somebody was running some kind of air
[02:24:25.700 --> 02:24:35.340]  pressure gun in the background but but uh but now I mean suddenly I feel like
[02:24:35.340 --> 02:24:40.500]  Rebecca Winkle I woke up and even think even I am different now like you my only point
[02:24:40.500 --> 02:24:43.540]  being that like there was a time when like you could fancy yourself a collector you're
[02:24:43.540 --> 02:24:48.020]  a CD collector and you collected them and you put them on the shelves in a certain order
[02:24:48.020 --> 02:24:52.020]  and you you know make them look pretty and for me the last gasp of that has been like
[02:24:52.020 --> 02:24:57.820]  like I said there's this app I use so music brains with the z.org is a really good site
[02:24:57.820 --> 02:25:01.400]  for finding metadata they've got metadata on pretty much any audio you could ever want
[02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:04.700]  it's like the basic you know there's you've got these four different kinds of media that's
[02:25:04.700 --> 02:25:09.260]  the one to go to for music stuff and they have an app called Picard this kind of janky
[02:25:09.260 --> 02:25:13.460]  but cool app where you can drop a bunch of mp3s on and you pick which album version that
[02:25:13.460 --> 02:25:17.500]  is and it's super smart about getting your metadata right and I feel like in my head
[02:25:17.500 --> 02:25:21.780]  that right there me getting a record that I got somewhere and dropping it into Picard
[02:25:21.780 --> 02:25:27.380]  is the last gasp of me as a music owning collector me sweating the metadata on that because at
[02:25:27.380 --> 02:25:32.420]  this point I'm sitting there and I'm going okay matched uploaded you know rejected like
[02:25:32.420 --> 02:25:36.260]  I don't even care anymore like I signed up for beats music and now most of it is there
[02:25:36.260 --> 02:25:40.620]  and all of a sudden all of these files are like virtually meaningless and I haven't missed
[02:25:40.620 --> 02:25:45.640]  it it's totally as somebody who has been obsessed with music for 40 years I can't believe how
[02:25:45.640 --> 02:25:51.740]  much I think I could live without almost all of that stuff and it's really weird yeah that's
[02:25:51.740 --> 02:25:55.900]  it's I'm exactly there with you whereas I used to have it you know I didn't I didn't
[02:25:55.900 --> 02:26:00.180]  buy a little compared to most of my friends probably probably bought fewer CDs than many
[02:26:00.180 --> 02:26:05.820]  of them but I certainly had a lot I remember you know in college thinking and it was absolutely
[02:26:05.820 --> 02:26:12.700]  positively no hyperbole that most of my liquid net worth was tied up in CDs season because
[02:26:12.700 --> 02:26:18.560]  I mean first thing I when I meet somebody go to their dorm room or later apartment very
[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:22.860]  first thing I do was look at their books and look at their CDs and see like how much I
[02:26:22.860 --> 02:26:26.420]  could learn about them from looking at like how they organize their CDs did they organize
[02:26:26.420 --> 02:26:30.700]  their CDs what books did they have did they have which ones were obviously much read and
[02:26:30.700 --> 02:26:35.820]  which ones were untouched books didn't have the resale value though that CDs did because
[02:26:35.820 --> 02:26:39.620]  you could what you could do for CDs when you were strapped for cash is sell a couple you
[02:26:39.620 --> 02:26:43.060]  know you'd find a couple that you haven't listened to for a while and you'd get you
[02:26:43.060 --> 02:26:49.020]  know 67 bucks for them you know and then they you could buy the used ones for like $9.99
[02:26:49.020 --> 02:26:52.500]  you know there was you know a little bit of arbitrage in there but you could you could
[02:26:52.500 --> 02:26:58.260]  take four or five CDs into the CD store and then come out with yeah absolutely but but
[02:26:58.260 --> 02:27:04.100]  you know it wasn't more than a few years ago that I remember hearing like it seemed revolutionary
[02:27:04.100 --> 02:27:08.380]  even in maybe my child's lifetime it seemed revolutionary to me that there was a service
[02:27:08.380 --> 02:27:15.060]  where you could mail or drop off all of your CDs and now get ready for this because what
[02:27:15.060 --> 02:27:19.900]  they're gonna do is they're gonna rip all those at high quality get the right metadata
[02:27:19.900 --> 02:27:25.340]  on them and then send them back to you on a hard drive like I swear to Christ it seems
[02:27:25.340 --> 02:27:29.340]  like about five years ago that still seemed amazingly innovative and now that seems like
[02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:34.140]  the craziest Rube Goldberg machine I've ever heard in my life it would be like alphabetizing
[02:27:34.140 --> 02:27:40.820]  my recycling like why would I do that today I don't know speaking about podcasts in the
[02:27:40.820 --> 02:27:48.180]  length of podcast I have one more sponsor to thank our fourth and final sponsor brand
[02:27:48.180 --> 02:27:52.780]  new up-and-comers I believe it's the first time they've sponsored a podcast it's a company
[02:27:52.780 --> 02:27:58.700]  called Squarespace is that a startup John that is a startup where they based I guess
[02:27:58.700 --> 02:28:09.520]  I think Silicon Valley John I think that they're on the internet Squarespace is an all-in-one
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:15.420]  way that create edit design modify your own website now you guys know they're not new
[02:28:15.420 --> 02:28:19.980]  they're old they've been here for a while they're the probably preeminent podcast sponsor
[02:28:19.980 --> 02:28:27.980]  out there but the fact is I've spoken to them that people keep signing up people keep needing
[02:28:27.980 --> 02:28:32.060]  you know it's like a funny thing because people you know you make a website you know I have
[02:28:32.060 --> 02:28:36.020]  daring fireball it keeps you know it's just the same thing but people keep coming up with
[02:28:36.020 --> 02:28:40.820]  new ideas for websites and more and more and more a lot of people are going to Squarespace
[02:28:40.820 --> 02:28:48.260]  first to set them up because it really is an incredibly adaptive platform for creating
[02:28:48.260 --> 02:28:55.060]  in very very different types of sites blogs podcasts awful lot of podcasts are hosted
[02:28:55.060 --> 02:29:02.540]  from Squarespace minus it's a great it's just you create a post you attach a piece of media
[02:29:02.540 --> 02:29:07.420]  and now you've officially become a podcaster it's that simple right and all the crazy stuff
[02:29:07.420 --> 02:29:11.620]  like getting an RSS feed that iTunes is going to be satisfied with it all just pops out
[02:29:11.620 --> 02:29:16.840]  the other end but if you're a photographer or and you want to set up a gallery site or
[02:29:16.840 --> 02:29:23.660]  a huge thing big and growing is their commerce features where you can set up a shop for anything
[02:29:23.660 --> 02:29:28.100]  whether you're selling t-shirts or here's like an example in right here on their site
[02:29:28.100 --> 02:29:34.740]  where they show it a company that makes neckties for gentlemen just go there if you haven't
[02:29:34.740 --> 02:29:39.540]  done it just go there and just look at their like gallery of example sites of things built
[02:29:39.540 --> 02:29:43.820]  with Squarespace and you almost can't believe that they're all built using the same platform
[02:29:43.820 --> 02:29:49.280]  because each one is so unique and different and original and fitting for what the purpose
[02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:55.300]  is whether it's like a graphic designer who's setting up a gallery of their work or somebody
[02:29:55.300 --> 02:30:02.340]  who is selling custom high-end coffee makers or something like that all of it now the brand
[02:30:02.340 --> 02:30:08.540]  new version 7 of their platform better than ever they have all sorts of information on
[02:30:08.540 --> 02:30:14.180]  the site I can't even get into how many ways that it's better but just really really cool
[02:30:14.180 --> 02:30:20.340]  company really great and it's just if you have an idea for a website of any kind your
[02:30:20.340 --> 02:30:26.180]  own podcast selling stuff starting a blog can't recommend highly enough that you go
[02:30:26.180 --> 02:30:31.420]  there because you're going to save so much time setting it up and it's really really
[02:30:31.420 --> 02:30:36.660]  great and they have award-winning technical support that's I probably fundamental even
[02:30:36.660 --> 02:30:40.420]  better more than the design of their platform itself it's the tech support that I think
[02:30:40.420 --> 02:30:44.260]  probably keeps them as successful as they are because it's the hardest thing to get
[02:30:44.260 --> 02:30:51.380]  right 24-7 customer support they've got people in New York I think it's Dublin somewhere
[02:30:51.380 --> 02:30:56.740]  in Europe and now Portland Oregon so that more or less covers the globe maybe maybe
[02:30:56.740 --> 02:31:05.700]  if you're Ben Thompson and you live in Taipei maybe you know it's yeah yeah he's over in
[02:31:05.700 --> 02:31:13.620]  Taipei like a type a personality oh no no he's in Taiwan it's funny it's always it's
[02:31:13.620 --> 02:31:16.880]  always funny trying to schedule the time to record a show with him because that's again
[02:31:16.880 --> 02:31:26.380]  talking time zones when you record with Ben Thompson he's he's like in tomorrow I love

[02:32:48.200 --> 02:32:54.180]  involved with the preschool for their son you know like the equivalent of PTA and that
[02:32:54.180 --> 02:33:00.180]  that school was going to have a fundraiser and I wanted to set up a new website like
[02:33:00.180 --> 02:33:03.920]  for this thing with the kids school and they had like a budget of like four or five thousand
[02:33:03.920 --> 02:33:09.160]  dollars or something which is a lot of money for like a you know donation run PTA and Marco
[02:33:09.160 --> 02:33:12.840]  of course being Marco I have me eyes were rolled my eyes Marco stuff is like you guys
[02:33:12.840 --> 02:33:17.560]  are nuts you guys should just give me a day and he like went and set up a Squarespace
[02:33:17.560 --> 02:33:22.980]  for the PTA and you know it was like 10 bucks a month and set it up and came back and like
[02:33:22.980 --> 02:33:26.480]  the next week's meeting it was like here here here's the thing and it's everything that
[02:33:26.480 --> 02:33:30.480]  you guys were budgeting five thousand dollars for now it's ten dollars a month and it just
[02:33:30.480 --> 02:33:35.480]  runs it's only true yeah and and like what he said is that he did it he did invest a
[02:33:35.480 --> 02:33:38.680]  little bit of time to get it up and running and pick a template and get the thing set
[02:33:38.680 --> 02:33:42.520]  up and configure it but now it just and you don't have to write documentation you don't
[02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:46.360]  have to write five pages we went through this with my kids preschool where like I've always
[02:33:46.360 --> 02:33:49.520]  been like look you don't need to know what I do for a living you don't need to know I'm
[02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:54.040]  on Twitter you need to know go put me over here to pull weeds and pick up cat poop with
[02:33:54.040 --> 02:33:58.260]  headphones on and I will be happy please do not put me on the IT committee somehow I ended
[02:33:58.260 --> 02:34:04.300]  up getting involved with the website and they had so much sunk cost in this really really
[02:34:04.300 --> 02:34:08.640]  stupid website that nobody ever used and nobody knew how to update they were so basically
[02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:12.280]  my job became like track down the person who knows the password find the person who knows
[02:34:12.280 --> 02:34:16.880]  the password get enough privileges that we can SSH in and like it's you're like look
[02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:22.400]  here's the thing have somebody spend one hour literally copying and pasting text from the
[02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:26.800]  pages that are up send that to me then I will have a website for you by tonight and then
[02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:32.840]  we'll never speak of it again and it's like it's a game changer right I honestly I think
[02:34:32.840 --> 02:34:36.720]  you're exactly right that that's the key that's the thing to take away with Squarespace is
[02:34:36.720 --> 02:34:40.400]  even if you don't have a need right now file them away in your back pocket for when you
[02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:44.480]  need to set up a website for someone and then you don't want to you don't want it like you
[02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:48.520]  said you don't want to have to back channel secret of Squarespace it's for people who
[02:34:48.520 --> 02:34:51.700]  maybe in some cases could make a site not that well not stand up that well but they
[02:34:51.700 --> 02:34:56.440]  certainly do not want to have to be maintaining their church's website in perpetuity right
[02:34:56.440 --> 02:35:03.640]  well we did it we went over one over two and a half bucks here 235 buddy people like it
[02:35:03.640 --> 02:35:07.920]  I don't if like I said I mean it sincerely go to you know right right to me at the Daring
[02:35:07.920 --> 02:35:12.980]  Firewall email thing you know there's a link on the website and let me if you really hate
[02:35:12.980 --> 02:35:16.520]  these long episodes let me know because nobody else is saying that people are saying they
[02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:23.080]  really dig it you know I think of it as you know I like I said I do it seems like I do
[02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:27.520]  about 40 episodes a year but they've gotten longer so it's I am podcasting because of
[02:35:27.520 --> 02:35:31.120]  the time change time some of them probably 24 hours wrapped around the international
[02:35:31.120 --> 02:35:34.400]  dateline there's probably some of your episodes that are that are still playing somewhere
[02:35:34.400 --> 02:35:42.200]  like all the time I'm up to be it the funniest moment on this whole recording was like that
[02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:46.880]  sad sound you made when I said that when you talk to Ben Thompson he's in tomorrow we're
[02:35:46.880 --> 02:35:51.720]  so grossed out it's you know I've I spent a lot of years trying to figure out a lot
[02:35:51.720 --> 02:35:56.840]  of things John and there are some little bits of crud that still just get stuck in the machine
[02:35:56.840 --> 02:36:01.000]  and when I try to imagine people who are living on a different day it just makes me fucking
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:05.360]  angry I hate it was like I don't understand it I don't I don't understand that I've been
[02:36:05.360 --> 02:36:11.160]  oh I mean it's like when you find out that the dinner is gonna be like you know like
[02:36:11.160 --> 02:36:19.000]  when the the whole the actual pigs head it's a delicacy all right and you're just not prepared
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:23.040]  for that level no no it's like somebody hands you they always think I have a sprite or you
[02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:27.440]  say like you say like can I have a like a coke and they hand you a diet dr. pepper you're
[02:36:27.440 --> 02:36:33.840]  like what the fuck is this yeah that's not what I signed up for I think we helped a lot
[02:36:33.840 --> 02:36:38.480]  of people today I had we always help people I do think that that's it's when you and I
[02:36:38.480 --> 02:36:41.800]  get together it's a public service just can we get a final update on your net internet
[02:36:41.800 --> 02:36:45.920]  how are things going did they fix the cones everything good they I still didn't get a
[02:36:45.920 --> 02:36:51.000]  text from them but my other machine here is on the Wi-Fi and it is seems to be running
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:59.640]  nice we waited him out oh man I don't know if the dog I don't know if I ever caught the
[02:36:59.640 --> 02:37:05.640]  cat never caught the cat well thanks for having me oh it's always a pleasure it's been too
[02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:10.120]  long it has been too long I'm I'm it's it's always a lot of fun to do I really enjoy your
[02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:15.720]  show and it's always great to be here do you think there's a branding angle on the dogs
[02:37:15.720 --> 02:37:20.640]  and cats like maybe they've got like a maybe they have like a commercial that involves
[02:37:20.640 --> 02:37:27.760]  a dog chase you know it's too random I got one thought they needed something to be in
[02:37:27.760 --> 02:37:33.520]  motion it was so clearly composited from stock art so let's just clip when people get I want
[02:37:33.520 --> 02:37:36.360]  you guys really take some time to go look at this and I want you to realize that he's
[02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:41.820]  on a ladder behind an orange cone to nowhere he's going to nowhere they needed some dynamism
[02:37:41.820 --> 02:37:45.880]  in it so what you have a horse galloping you could have a dog chase a cat maybe you could
[02:37:45.880 --> 02:37:50.800]  have something falling from a roof like a satellite dish ooh burn like I don't know
[02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:59.040]  I think the dog and the cat are there for dynamism I guess so that's part of the experience
[02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:03.560]  I really hope I hope that whoever made that graphic that somebody you know worked probably
[02:38:03.560 --> 02:38:08.760]  right here in Philadelphia working in the Comcast Tower you know with the graphic design
[02:38:08.760 --> 02:38:13.720]  job and then are you know an art degree and dreams of a good job listens to our show and
[02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:18.100]  knows just how much joy they brought into our life making a graphic that maybe while
[02:38:18.100 --> 02:38:22.480]  they were making it was a bit of a drudgery because I got to tell you it really made my
[02:38:22.480 --> 02:38:27.400]  day me too man I just said the drop shadow by the cone was really really absorbing for
[02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:31.680]  me if I can get over the idea of where that guy lives in China I might be think about
[02:38:31.680 --> 02:38:37.280]  that when I'm sleeping tonight Merlin man let's tell people where they can find out
