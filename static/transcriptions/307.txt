[00:00.000 --> 00:02.840]  I feel like we're getting institutionalized, you know?
[00:02.840 --> 00:05.880]  Well, yeah, I mean, it does feel like that, right?
[00:05.880 --> 00:07.080]  I mean, like you're kind of locked up,
[00:07.080 --> 00:11.880]  but don't have to get up early anymore.
[00:11.880 --> 00:13.560]  So that's good.
[00:13.560 --> 00:16.140]  And basically the entire family appreciates that.
[00:16.140 --> 00:19.000]  Even the dogs have gotten into that routine now.
[00:19.000 --> 00:20.040]  The big dog, he won't get,
[00:20.040 --> 00:21.840]  I mean, he doesn't get up before nine.
[00:21.840 --> 00:30.840]  That's pretty good for a dog, really. That is pretty good.
[00:30.840 --> 00:31.840]  Well, he's old now. I mean, both of them are old. They're both 12.
[00:31.840 --> 00:34.960]  But yeah, he does not see the need to be up and around.
[00:34.960 --> 00:37.560]  He basically gets up when he has to go to the bathroom,
[00:37.560 --> 00:42.520]  and he gets up and he's like in a big hurry too.
[00:42.520 --> 00:43.800]  He's a typical old man.
[00:43.800 --> 00:44.800]  Yeah.
[00:44.800 --> 00:47.720]  He's just like, oh, I got to go to the bathroom and I got to go right now.
[00:47.720 --> 00:53.560]  I do think that is part of why dogs are so great is they are very much like people in
[00:53.560 --> 00:57.680]  that way in that they age in similar ways.
[00:57.680 --> 01:03.200]  Like I don't need that, right?
[01:03.200 --> 01:07.040]  There's just a whole bunch of stuff in life that as you get older as a person, you're
[01:07.040 --> 01:09.160]  like, ah, I don't need that.
[01:09.160 --> 01:10.360]  I don't need to put up with that.
[01:10.360 --> 01:16.920]  That's why old people, the older you get, the more curt you are with bad service.
[01:16.920 --> 01:19.920]  And he makes a lot of noises like getting up and getting down like I do.
[01:19.920 --> 01:26.560]  So it's just, oh, oh, my hip.
[01:26.560 --> 01:30.720]  I remember with my childhood dog who lived, I believe he died when I was in college.
[01:30.720 --> 01:32.120]  So he lived a long time.
[01:32.120 --> 01:36.320]  Chester, he and he was, I mean, like vicious to the mailman.
[01:36.320 --> 01:41.960]  I mean, like I know all dogs hate the mailman, but I mean, he was nuts.
[01:41.960 --> 01:44.720]  And there were times when he'd get real old and I'd come home from college
[01:44.720 --> 01:47.640]  and there'd be times where he'd be sleeping and the mail would come and he'd
[01:47.640 --> 01:51.360]  he'd get up, he'd perk his head and he would you could see the anger because he
[01:51.360 --> 01:54.920]  and he was like, you know, they don't call him rescue dogs anymore.
[01:54.920 --> 01:56.920]  But we got him from somebody in a trailer park.
[01:56.920 --> 02:01.680]  You know, it's you know, he wasn't, you know, he was like a total mixed breed.
[02:01.680 --> 02:06.760]  Poodle, peek, peek, a poo thing, had a bad underbite.
[02:06.760 --> 02:10.360]  And when he'd get angry, the underbite would get worse because, you know, he'd
[02:10.360 --> 02:15.600]  grit his teeth, he'd get up and grit and he'd ask for it.
[02:15.600 --> 02:20.880]  That seems like a lot of trouble.
[02:20.880 --> 02:22.880]  You expend the energy.
[02:22.880 --> 02:28.840]  It's it's sort of like he was saying to the mailman, you know,
[02:28.840 --> 02:31.360]  just reminding him.
[02:31.360 --> 02:31.880]  Did you ever hear that?
[02:31.880 --> 02:32.800]  Hey, Carl.
[02:32.800 --> 02:35.240]  Hey, Carl, I'm still here.
[02:35.240 --> 02:37.920]  Oh, man, we got a lot to talk about.
[02:37.920 --> 02:40.200]  Can you believe that old Trump is out of office?
[02:40.200 --> 02:43.200]  This is the first post-Trump episode of the talk show.
[02:43.200 --> 02:43.880]  Is that right?
[02:43.880 --> 02:44.200]  It is.
[02:44.200 --> 02:44.920]  Wow.
[02:44.920 --> 02:45.760]  Yeah, I guess so.
[02:45.760 --> 02:52.200]  Yeah, I did one with Montero after a sort of, you know, there was like a little
[02:52.200 --> 02:54.920]  insurrection, a little...
[02:54.920 --> 02:56.080]  There was an incident.
[02:56.080 --> 02:57.840]  There's an incident.
[02:57.840 --> 03:00.280]  But old Trumpy was still in office and now he's out.
[03:00.280 --> 03:03.120]  And man, do I feel better.
[03:03.120 --> 03:04.440]  Oh, yeah.
[03:04.440 --> 03:06.520]  Another I mean, yeah, I was talking about sleeping.
[03:06.520 --> 03:08.080]  I mean, it's true.
[03:08.080 --> 03:09.800]  Really, what I was doing was staying in bed.
[03:09.800 --> 03:11.040]  I wasn't sleeping much.
[03:11.040 --> 03:12.040]  Do you have any ideas?
[03:12.040 --> 03:13.560]  Now I'm sleeping.
[03:13.560 --> 03:14.880]  And it is true.
[03:14.880 --> 03:18.200]  There are so many things that have gone on in the last year.
[03:18.200 --> 03:20.080]  I would say over the four years of Trump.
[03:20.080 --> 03:24.080]  But you know, 2020 in particular will be remembered.
[03:24.080 --> 03:28.840]  It's the most memorable of the four Trump years, for sure.
[03:28.840 --> 03:33.920]  But it's like been an obsession of mine recently is the way that we as human
[03:33.920 --> 03:39.080]  beings convince ourselves that we can intellectualize certain things.
[03:39.080 --> 03:42.160]  But it's not the same thing as actually experiencing them.
[03:42.160 --> 03:51.320]  Like, it's like, you know, that war is vicious and bad and violent and that
[03:51.320 --> 03:53.080]  it's gruesome and horrible.
[03:53.080 --> 03:56.280]  But if you see pictures of it, it hits you in a way, right?
[03:56.280 --> 04:00.360]  And it's like, you know, like when those those pictures of the Abu
[04:00.360 --> 04:06.440]  Ghrail prison in the Iraq situation 15 some years ago came out.
[04:06.440 --> 04:10.680]  You can hear a description of those photos and be appalled and outraged.
[04:10.680 --> 04:14.560]  But because the pictures actually leaked, it was worse.
[04:14.560 --> 04:16.320]  It shouldn't be in theory.
[04:16.320 --> 04:21.480]  We should be able to be fully outraged through the intellectual aspect of it.
[04:21.480 --> 04:22.480]  But we're not.
[04:22.480 --> 04:25.960]  You know, we're animals at a certain sense.
[04:25.960 --> 04:30.680]  We knew that it would be better when we had a president who
[04:30.680 --> 04:34.280]  didn't have to check if he tweeted something every morning.
[04:34.280 --> 04:35.560]  Well, yeah, and that's the thing.
[04:35.560 --> 04:38.000]  I mean, also, just of having an empty platform from Twitter,
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.920]  as you guys talked about, is huge, right?
[04:41.920 --> 04:45.080]  I mean, because you imagine what he'd be saying right now.
[04:45.080 --> 04:48.840]  Now, you know, and I don't and I had him muted.
[04:48.840 --> 04:52.200]  I mean, I think I had blocked him, you know, from day one.
[04:52.200 --> 04:55.560]  But you still couldn't get away from it.
[04:55.560 --> 04:58.360]  People would like screen capture, tweet, retweet.
[04:58.360 --> 05:02.320]  I mean, they would do like there's any number of ways that they can other
[05:02.320 --> 05:06.840]  people can force you to see the idiotic things that the president is saying.
[05:06.840 --> 05:12.160]  And it was exhausting.
[05:12.160 --> 05:13.560]  I knew I'd sleep better.
[05:13.560 --> 05:15.440]  But man, do I sleep better.
[05:15.440 --> 05:17.920]  Like, we're recording on Saturday.
[05:17.920 --> 05:22.240]  Do you have any idea what Joe Biden is up to right now?
[05:22.240 --> 05:23.840]  I have no idea.
[05:23.840 --> 05:24.880]  No, I don't.
[05:24.880 --> 05:28.720]  Though I do tune into the news conferences now, the press conferences.
[05:28.720 --> 05:29.560]  Aren't they great?
[05:29.560 --> 05:31.960]  Because it's just such a, you know, it's like, oh my God,
[05:31.960 --> 05:34.720]  there's there's competence.
[05:34.720 --> 05:37.040]  That's because that's also relaxing.
[05:37.040 --> 05:39.400]  It's just it's delightfully boring.
[05:39.400 --> 05:40.920]  That is exactly the word, though.
[05:40.920 --> 05:42.080]  It's competence. Right.
[05:42.080 --> 05:45.280]  And it's like, even if you don't agree on certain other policies, it's like,
[05:45.280 --> 05:49.040]  isn't it nice to have competent people talking about these things
[05:49.040 --> 05:52.480]  and giving answers that aren't screaming?
[05:52.480 --> 05:53.480]  Yeah, yelling. Yeah.
[05:53.480 --> 05:55.800]  Confrontational. That's right.
[05:55.800 --> 05:57.720]  You know, sometimes they're there.
[05:57.720 --> 06:01.480]  And there are still things I worry about, of course, because the GOP is not
[06:01.480 --> 06:03.000]  it's not really improved.
[06:03.000 --> 06:06.360]  I mean, they're they're doubling down on
[06:06.360 --> 06:11.080]  the same stuff that they've been saying for the last two and a half months.
[06:11.080 --> 06:13.920]  And and I just I don't see this ending in a good place.
[06:13.920 --> 06:18.800]  But at least we're not in the same crappy situation
[06:18.800 --> 06:20.800]  we were in back in the fall.
[06:20.800 --> 06:23.800]  All right. And like listening to Fauci talk now, it's like, I mean,
[06:23.800 --> 06:25.800]  how did how did that guy skate through?
[06:25.800 --> 06:27.640]  It's really remarkable.
[06:27.640 --> 06:31.920]  I mean, and again, I'm not saying that that even Fauci in particular
[06:31.920 --> 06:35.800]  is without blame and that there were, you know, certain policies and aspects
[06:35.800 --> 06:41.080]  like with the masks and stuff early in the in the pandemic where he was wrong.
[06:41.080 --> 06:42.640]  He's not perfect like that.
[06:42.640 --> 06:47.360]  Again, it's like one of the things that's so obvious is
[06:47.360 --> 06:52.120]  the worst thing in our media culture that you can be is wrong
[06:52.120 --> 06:56.800]  about one thing, one time, really, obviously, like if you're mostly right
[06:56.800 --> 07:01.560]  and then you make one mistake, then it's like there's this giant pile on,
[07:01.560 --> 07:05.600]  as opposed to other people who are wrong every single time
[07:05.600 --> 07:08.000]  they open their mouths, like that Larry Kudlow guy.
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.240]  Just talk about, you know, something
[07:10.240 --> 07:15.400]  that guy is wrong about everything, everything.
[07:15.400 --> 07:19.440]  Right. It's like, oh, well, you know, the CDC and Fauci made
[07:19.440 --> 07:24.000]  made some pretty bad mistakes in their messaging on face masks
[07:24.000 --> 07:25.440]  early on in the pandemic.
[07:25.440 --> 07:28.480]  And but it's like, OK, they were wrong.
[07:28.480 --> 07:29.640]  You know, mistakes happen.
[07:29.640 --> 07:31.240]  But for the most part, they're right.
[07:31.240 --> 07:34.480]  But Fauci looks he looks five years younger.
[07:34.480 --> 07:36.600]  Yeah. Yeah.
[07:36.600 --> 07:40.120]  And you heard that comment he made in like his first press conference about
[07:40.120 --> 07:41.440]  he said he asked him some question.
[07:41.440 --> 07:44.320]  He said, I really I don't know the answer to that.
[07:44.320 --> 07:47.040]  He said something along the lines of like one of the differences
[07:47.040 --> 07:50.440]  between the previous administration and this administration is when we don't know
[07:50.440 --> 07:53.240]  the answer, we're going to tell you and we're not just going to make something up.
[07:53.240 --> 07:59.240]  Right. Which is so it's that was and in particular, he's like,
[07:59.240 --> 08:02.640]  and we're going to let science and medicine guide all of our answers
[08:02.640 --> 08:04.440]  and policies, and that's a big change.
[08:04.440 --> 08:08.640]  And it's like, yes, not not whatever makes the president look good. Right.
[08:08.800 --> 08:13.880]  And it's like I think we all knew that what what makes the president look good
[08:13.880 --> 08:18.080]  or just what the president wants to hear or the way he wants it to be.
[08:18.080 --> 08:20.200]  And that's what he wants you to say,
[08:20.200 --> 08:23.600]  versus what we actually think do the best of our knowledge
[08:23.600 --> 08:26.680]  scientifically and medically is the difference in messaging.
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.360]  But that that I don't know part.
[08:31.400 --> 08:34.360]  To me, was was not clear
[08:34.640 --> 08:37.160]  while Trump was in office, but I suspected it.
[08:37.160 --> 08:40.840]  But that Foushee coming out and saying that I don't know
[08:40.840 --> 08:46.360]  was an unacceptable answer during the last administration is so important.
[08:46.640 --> 08:49.680]  You know, it's like so many people in so many fields, like
[08:49.680 --> 08:52.800]  will just bullshit if they don't know, because they feel like I don't know,
[08:52.800 --> 08:53.680]  makes them look bad.
[08:53.680 --> 08:55.360]  It's better to bullshit than it.
[08:55.360 --> 08:59.200]  I don't know is like once you accept it and you're like, when you don't know,
[08:59.200 --> 09:00.680]  just say, I don't know.
[09:00.680 --> 09:02.120]  It is it's life changing.
[09:02.120 --> 09:05.800]  It is like one of my top 10 tricks for life is embrace.
[09:05.920 --> 09:06.880]  It's the same thing.
[09:06.880 --> 09:07.480]  It's the same thing.
[09:07.480 --> 09:09.440]  I think you've said this before and other people have as well.
[09:09.440 --> 09:14.040]  But Trump is a poor person's idea of a rich person. Right.
[09:14.160 --> 09:16.480]  And he's you know, and he's also like
[09:16.480 --> 09:21.200]  also like a dumb person's idea of a smart person. Right.
[09:21.200 --> 09:25.040]  Very true, because he's nothing but confident. Right. Yeah. Mm hmm.
[09:28.240 --> 09:30.480]  Anyway, I feel good.
[09:32.480 --> 09:35.240]  I do. I really do.
[09:35.240 --> 09:36.640]  I feel better. Let's put it that way.
[09:36.640 --> 09:39.720]  I do feel I feel a lot better.
[09:39.720 --> 09:43.440]  My folks have a vaccine appointment for Tuesday.
[09:43.720 --> 09:45.840]  Oh, nice. Which is a huge relief.
[09:45.840 --> 09:47.720]  And what a hassle. Oh, my God.
[09:47.720 --> 09:49.680]  What a mess this whole vaccine thing is.
[09:49.680 --> 09:52.200]  But yeah, and my my dad is 83.
[09:52.200 --> 09:54.600]  My mom is 75. They should be you know,
[09:55.480 --> 09:59.160]  it should not be hard for them to get scheduled for this.
[09:59.160 --> 10:00.880]  But it was a mess.
[10:00.880 --> 10:02.960]  I mean, and thank God they were diligent about it.
[10:02.960 --> 10:06.560]  Like my mom like had to work the phone for days because,
[10:06.800 --> 10:08.840]  you know, they'd be like, OK, here's the number to call.
[10:09.400 --> 10:12.800]  And it and because it's result.
[10:12.840 --> 10:14.080]  Yeah, it was like overwhelmed.
[10:14.080 --> 10:18.000]  And they were like, they got they got an email like some parts of the system
[10:18.000 --> 10:23.440]  worked like some part of the health care system that they're in
[10:23.800 --> 10:28.360]  sent them both an email that said, OK, you're eligible now for a vaccine
[10:28.360 --> 10:32.400]  and you can go to this website and the website crashed.
[10:32.840 --> 10:36.000]  You know, and it's like, you know, and I'm only talking on the phone.
[10:36.000 --> 10:37.040]  I can't prove it.
[10:37.040 --> 10:39.680]  But then like they said, like the next day, the paper came out and said,
[10:39.680 --> 10:42.320]  oh, yeah, the website crashed.
[10:42.320 --> 10:45.080]  It's just terrible.
[10:45.320 --> 10:46.400]  So I'm relieved about that.
[10:46.400 --> 10:47.800]  I figure I feel like I don't think.
[10:47.800 --> 10:49.480]  Yeah, my parents haven't had it yet.
[10:49.480 --> 10:51.360]  And they're older.
[10:51.360 --> 10:54.720]  Eighty seven ish, eighty six, eighty seven.
[10:54.760 --> 10:57.520]  And they're but they're in Florida.
[10:58.440 --> 11:00.800]  And I just assume the whole system is completely screwed up.
[11:01.680 --> 11:04.960]  Well, Florida has a thing where there are people who are flying
[11:04.960 --> 11:07.960]  in from other parts of the country to get the vaccine because it's like
[11:07.960 --> 11:09.640]  you don't have to be a Florida resident.
[11:09.640 --> 11:13.800]  I this it's just the exact sort of thing
[11:13.800 --> 11:18.200]  that has to come top down instead of bottom up.
[11:18.240 --> 11:22.120]  And the Trump administration, each state having their own system is bananas.
[11:22.120 --> 11:25.200]  Well, and then each state delegates it to like the county levels.
[11:25.200 --> 11:27.440]  Like that's yeah, that's who my parents are dealing with.
[11:27.440 --> 11:29.120]  It's a county level issue here in Philly.
[11:29.120 --> 11:32.760]  It's the city and you know, it's a mess.
[11:32.760 --> 11:34.880]  It's horrible. You know, we're like a national
[11:36.040 --> 11:38.640]  disgrace because somehow the city hired.
[11:38.640 --> 11:40.760]  Do you see this story?
[11:41.280 --> 11:42.440]  I'll put a link in the show notes.
[11:42.440 --> 11:43.680]  I got to link it from Daring Firewall.
[11:43.680 --> 11:46.280]  But even Colbert had a whole segment on it last night
[11:46.760 --> 11:51.760]  where the city hired some some outfit called Philadelphia COVID Fight.
[11:51.760 --> 11:54.200]  And they got like a sort of a rocky ish logo.
[11:54.560 --> 11:58.200]  And apparently they ran a testing site earlier in the year
[11:58.200 --> 12:00.800]  that was somewhat successful.
[12:00.800 --> 12:04.520]  And so they somehow got a contract from the city to help administer vaccines.
[12:04.520 --> 12:06.360]  But I'm not making this up.
[12:06.360 --> 12:09.840]  The CEO of the company is a kid from Drexel, who's 22 years old.
[12:09.840 --> 12:11.920]  They're all college students.
[12:11.920 --> 12:16.840]  None of them. Nobody and nobody in the company has any medical expertise at all.
[12:16.840 --> 12:19.280]  Nobody's a doctor. They're all like 20.
[12:19.280 --> 12:23.320]  And they started taking appointments from people, turning people away at the door.
[12:23.320 --> 12:25.640]  There were senior citizens who had these appointments.
[12:25.640 --> 12:27.920]  They're crying out in the street because they won't be let in.
[12:27.920 --> 12:32.440]  And then it turned out that all these these 19, 20, 21 year old kids
[12:32.880 --> 12:34.840]  were just given each other the vaccines.
[12:34.840 --> 12:37.120]  And they're not they're not even nurses, doctors.
[12:37.840 --> 12:41.000]  I mean, I you couldn't make this not see that.
[12:41.000 --> 12:42.560]  Oh, you could. You can't make it up.
[12:42.560 --> 12:46.760]  It's and everybody is like, how did this like?
[12:46.760 --> 12:49.560]  Somebody's head is going to roll in the city because people are.
[12:50.120 --> 12:51.400]  I mean, tempers are short.
[12:51.400 --> 12:52.960]  That is. Yeah.
[12:52.960 --> 12:56.560]  People, you know, people are at the end of their freaking ropes.
[12:59.240 --> 13:02.520]  Bad. I don't I don't expect to get the vaccine until like
[13:02.520 --> 13:05.200]  I'm I'm 85.
[13:08.520 --> 13:12.280]  I think, yeah, I mean, I don't think I'm going to get mine until late spring.
[13:12.320 --> 13:14.160]  Early summer. Right. For sure.
[13:14.160 --> 13:16.720]  I would imagine. I mean, I you know, I'm in my 50s.
[13:17.080 --> 13:20.000]  You'd think I'd be like I have a decent chance of getting it,
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.680]  but I don't go anywhere like I don't I don't need to be anywhere in particular.
[13:25.600 --> 13:29.680]  Well, I would imagine that puts me down down a few notches.
[13:29.680 --> 13:33.160]  Yeah, the city does have a city of Philly does have a sign up form
[13:33.160 --> 13:35.480]  where you can get like on some kind of list.
[13:35.480 --> 13:38.840]  And I'm not quite sure how it works, but my own doctor sent it to us and said,
[13:38.840 --> 13:40.040]  you know, you should sign up here.
[13:40.040 --> 13:43.080]  I don't know, you know, what's going to come of it, but everybody should sign up.
[13:43.680 --> 13:46.720]  And so I signed up and, you know, it's like, what's your name?
[13:46.720 --> 13:48.400]  What's your address? What's your age?
[13:48.400 --> 13:50.280]  And it's like, do any of these apply to you?
[13:50.280 --> 13:52.120]  And there's a list of like 30 things.
[13:52.120 --> 13:55.640]  And they're clearly all things that would make you more likely to get it.
[13:55.640 --> 13:58.640]  Like, are you a health care worker? Are you a first responder?
[13:58.640 --> 14:02.760]  Do you know, you know, are you morbidly obese?
[14:02.760 --> 14:04.880]  Do you have it?
[14:04.880 --> 14:08.280]  There's not a single thing on the list that I even vaguely
[14:09.160 --> 14:11.960]  possibly even like squint your eyes
[14:11.960 --> 14:15.560]  and look on the horizon could possibly claim to qualify for.
[14:15.560 --> 14:17.760]  You could pull a Homer Simpson and just start eating.
[14:17.760 --> 14:21.320]  I know that's that was my joke to Amy.
[14:21.320 --> 14:24.720]  I was like, start nothing but carbs.
[14:26.600 --> 14:28.160]  That's why you had the big pasta meal.
[14:28.160 --> 14:30.200]  Yeah, exactly.
[14:32.480 --> 14:35.960]  All right, let me take a break and thank our first sponsor.
[14:36.080 --> 14:39.720]  Oh, man, do I love this company, Mack Weldon.
[14:40.880 --> 14:43.480]  Look, there's probably a lot of a lot of things you'd like to leave behind
[14:43.480 --> 14:47.120]  in 2020, one of the most important being your old underwear drawer.
[14:47.200 --> 14:50.760]  If you're rolling into the new year with the same bunching, chafing,
[14:50.760 --> 14:54.760]  uncomfortable underwear, then you've got to check out Mack Weldon, Mack Weldon.
[14:54.760 --> 14:55.600]  That's where they started.
[14:55.600 --> 14:59.240]  Underwear essentials, they call them undershirts, underwear, socks.
[15:00.720 --> 15:01.920]  Anyway, they are great.
[15:01.920 --> 15:02.960]  It's a great thing.
[15:02.960 --> 15:04.960]  Just take all you know, it's a great tip.
[15:04.960 --> 15:06.920]  Just take all of your old socks.
[15:06.920 --> 15:07.920]  Throw them the hell out.
[15:07.920 --> 15:10.080]  Buy all new socks all at once.
[15:10.080 --> 15:11.600]  Wear them evenly.
[15:11.600 --> 15:15.000]  And then you you don't have like half a collection of old socks,
[15:15.000 --> 15:16.280]  some medium socks.
[15:16.280 --> 15:20.200]  This is buying your socks in bulk and then just wearing them.
[15:20.480 --> 15:22.480]  It's a great tip. Life tip.
[15:22.480 --> 15:24.600]  I love Mack Weldon stuff.
[15:24.600 --> 15:26.760]  Don't even get me started on their slippers.
[15:26.760 --> 15:28.160]  Oh, my God, the slippers.
[15:28.160 --> 15:30.200]  I got the slippers on right now. I'm wearing them.
[15:31.320 --> 15:32.960]  They're great slippers and they last long.
[15:32.960 --> 15:35.720]  The problem for me is I wear them 18 hours a day every day
[15:35.720 --> 15:37.400]  because I don't leave the house.
[15:37.400 --> 15:39.960]  But it's freezing cold here in Philadelphia.
[15:39.960 --> 15:43.920]  My feet are toasty warm, very comfortable, thanks to their amazing slippers.
[15:44.760 --> 15:49.760]  Every time I pump these slippers on on on this show, they sell out.
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  So if you're interested in a great pair of slippers,
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.840]  oh, go go check them out immediately as you listen to the podcast,
[15:55.840 --> 15:56.960]  because they might sell out.
[15:56.960 --> 15:59.240]  But I love them. And they're the type of slippers.
[15:59.240 --> 16:02.320]  You can kind of just slip your feet into them without tucking over the heel.
[16:02.600 --> 16:04.720]  But they do have a little heel in the back.
[16:04.720 --> 16:06.360]  So, you know, for safety's sake.
[16:06.360 --> 16:08.840]  So like me, you don't like a clutch fall down the stairs
[16:08.840 --> 16:11.440]  or something like that because your slippers are falling off.
[16:11.440 --> 16:12.640]  I love it. They've got everything.
[16:12.640 --> 16:15.400]  No hoodies, polos, active shorts.
[16:15.920 --> 16:17.400]  Everything looks great, feels great.
[16:17.400 --> 16:19.160]  They've got advanced technology.
[16:19.160 --> 16:20.480]  Don't even get me started on this stuff.
[16:20.480 --> 16:24.720]  But seriously, they they call them air knit, dry knit, warm knit.
[16:25.200 --> 16:27.360]  Their underwear is made out of this.
[16:27.720 --> 16:30.320]  These fabrics that are supposed to be anti anti
[16:31.200 --> 16:33.040]  microbial microbial.
[16:33.040 --> 16:35.440]  Make sure what they mean is you're not going to stink.
[16:36.000 --> 16:37.880]  And it's true. I think it works.
[16:37.880 --> 16:40.280]  They're great in the summer. They're great in the winter.
[16:40.400 --> 16:43.480]  I've got a hoodie from them that I wear every time I get chilly.
[16:44.040 --> 16:47.120]  I just you know, because I'm getting to be an old man.
[16:47.120 --> 16:48.680]  I don't turn up the heat. You know what I do?
[16:48.680 --> 16:51.440]  I put another layer on and I've got this hoodie from them.
[16:51.880 --> 16:53.960]  You're not paying to heat the neighborhood. Exactly.
[16:54.360 --> 16:56.240]  It's true. I don't know what happens.
[16:56.240 --> 16:59.480]  I don't. Something biological kicks in at some point in your 40s.
[17:00.480 --> 17:02.920]  And and then I look at the thermostat.
[17:02.920 --> 17:05.040]  My who turned this up? Just put another layer on.
[17:05.040 --> 17:08.080]  And I'm like, my God, you really do turn into your father as you get older.
[17:08.080 --> 17:12.560]  Anyway, Mack Weldon, they've got this totally free loyalty program.
[17:13.040 --> 17:14.040]  You don't have to do anything.

[17:56.400 --> 17:58.200]  but they'll still refund you.

[18:29.200 --> 18:31.360]  I can't even can't even count at all.
[18:31.360 --> 18:33.080]  Yeah, I did exactly what you suggested.
[18:33.080 --> 18:37.480]  I like a year or two ago, I threw out all my underwear and went all Mack Weldon
[18:38.680 --> 18:42.680]  and buy it in a big batch and then they all wear out at the same time.
[18:42.680 --> 18:45.400]  And it's like, all right, time to throw it all out again and start all over.
[18:45.400 --> 18:46.560]  Yeah, not mine.
[18:46.560 --> 18:47.560]  I'm worn out again.
[18:47.560 --> 18:48.880]  Well, I'm hard on underwear.
[18:49.360 --> 18:52.000]  Yeah, just sitting a lot. Yeah.
[18:55.720 --> 18:57.160]  Right. The seat.
[18:59.160 --> 19:00.640]  All right. What do we want to talk about?
[19:00.640 --> 19:02.680]  Let's yeah. Where do you want to start?
[19:02.880 --> 19:05.080]  Why don't we start with the stonks?
[19:05.080 --> 19:07.920]  That's a that's a that's a word that I learned this week.
[19:08.760 --> 19:10.560]  Did you did you know this?
[19:10.560 --> 19:11.400]  This I've heard it.
[19:11.400 --> 19:13.400]  I mean, I assume it's just the meme thing, right?
[19:13.400 --> 19:15.920]  It's just it's just a dumb way of saying stocks, right?
[19:15.920 --> 19:17.360]  Yeah, I think so.
[19:17.360 --> 19:19.680]  But this is not it's not anything other than that.
[19:19.680 --> 19:23.640]  In addition to my my personal thermostat policies, another sign
[19:23.920 --> 19:27.320]  of my rocketing into the deep ends of middle age are
[19:28.000 --> 19:31.840]  the fact that I just see slang now and I don't even look it up.
[19:31.840 --> 19:32.760]  Right. Don't look it up.
[19:32.760 --> 19:36.400]  I take I take a guess, but they call the kids call them stonks.
[19:39.600 --> 19:41.160]  My dad called me yesterday.
[19:41.160 --> 19:42.680]  This is true story.
[19:42.680 --> 19:44.840]  This is how I knew that this is this was for real.
[19:44.840 --> 19:45.960]  This is a real sensation.
[19:45.960 --> 19:49.920]  My dad called me yesterday to ask what the hell's going on with this game stock.
[19:54.560 --> 19:56.960]  He actually called a game stock.
[19:56.960 --> 20:01.280]  And I'm like, and now that he said it, now I can't say it's hard for me.
[20:01.280 --> 20:02.760]  Not it's hard to say the other way.
[20:02.760 --> 20:03.560]  The right way.
[20:03.560 --> 20:05.280]  And I'm like, so that was a fun call.
[20:05.280 --> 20:06.280]  That was actually fun.
[20:06.280 --> 20:07.520]  I should have recorded it.
[20:07.520 --> 20:08.720]  It would have been a fun little mini.
[20:08.720 --> 20:09.880]  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[20:09.880 --> 20:13.400]  Instead of having me on Jesus, me explaining to my dad the GameStop
[20:13.400 --> 20:17.120]  situation and where do you start?
[20:17.760 --> 20:19.040]  It's it's kind of nuts.
[20:19.040 --> 20:21.480]  This is the thing that's always been in the back of my mind
[20:21.480 --> 20:24.040]  with the stock market is it would it would.
[20:24.320 --> 20:28.200]  I like if I were Tim Cook or Jeff Bezos or anybody
[20:28.200 --> 20:32.520]  who runs a big, good, successful company, I would lose sleep every night
[20:32.520 --> 20:37.520]  knowing that the fate of my company is in the hands of this
[20:37.520 --> 20:42.720]  totally irrational market that could do something like drive GameStop up.
[20:42.720 --> 20:43.120]  Yeah.
[20:43.120 --> 20:48.320]  Nineteen nineteen thousand nineteen hundred percent in a month institute.
[20:48.320 --> 20:51.000]  Institutionalized gambling is what it is.
[20:51.000 --> 20:56.560]  But like it's very strange.
[20:56.560 --> 21:00.560]  And then you combine it with the story of this Robin Hood brokerage.
[21:01.440 --> 21:05.320]  And it it really becomes a fascinating story.
[21:05.320 --> 21:08.520]  And it it it a couple of explanations I've seen.
[21:08.960 --> 21:12.880]  And I believe it is that there's a there's really like three or four stories.
[21:12.880 --> 21:15.160]  And it's not that they're in conflict with each other.
[21:15.360 --> 21:18.520]  It's it's that they're all true and they're different.
[21:18.520 --> 21:20.720]  And they don't even sometimes they don't even intersect.
[21:21.080 --> 21:24.520]  But that they the conflation of all of them happening at once
[21:25.360 --> 21:27.680]  made this bizarre thing happen.
[21:27.680 --> 21:33.720]  Yeah, I spent I used years ago, I used to know the details of like shorting.
[21:33.720 --> 21:37.320]  Right. And I don't know, I don't I don't remember them anymore.
[21:37.320 --> 21:39.360]  And I almost like at the beginning of this thing, I was like,
[21:39.360 --> 21:41.480]  I should figure out how that works exactly.
[21:41.480 --> 21:42.840]  And I started reading something.
[21:42.840 --> 21:45.080]  I said, they're betting, right?
[21:45.600 --> 21:48.320]  They're just they're they're placing a bet that the stock is going to go down.
[21:48.360 --> 21:50.240]  That's that's all I really needed to know.
[21:50.680 --> 21:54.720]  And lo and behold, a bunch of other people decided,
[21:54.720 --> 21:55.960]  now we're going to make it go up.
[21:56.960 --> 21:59.880]  A bunch of Internet jerks decided we're going to make it go up.
[21:59.880 --> 22:06.160]  Well, and the other aspect to it is that they did these some of these heads like.
[22:06.560 --> 22:10.400]  So the idea that that the people who made it go up, stuck it to quote
[22:10.400 --> 22:13.320]  all of Wall Street is, of course, nonsense, right?
[22:13.320 --> 22:15.840]  Because at some point, all of Wall Street,
[22:15.840 --> 22:19.240]  at least if you consider Wall Street to be the financial industry,
[22:20.120 --> 22:22.800]  they're like they are like the casino where they just win.
[22:22.800 --> 22:24.400]  The more people play. Right.
[22:24.400 --> 22:27.960]  It's like if the casino is busy, the casino is making money.
[22:27.960 --> 22:32.000]  And so if like people are making lots of trades, Wall Street as a whole
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.640]  is doing well. It's it's a few particular hedge fund investors
[22:36.640 --> 22:41.720]  who who had these short positions in GameStop and maybe AMC movie theaters.
[22:41.720 --> 22:44.200]  And who are the other darlings this week?
[22:44.200 --> 22:47.480]  I forget. Blackberry, for some reason, that sort of very.
[22:47.480 --> 22:50.960]  Yeah, that's the one that really escapes me, because I GameStop.
[22:51.440 --> 22:55.720]  You get that these 20 year olds have affinity for the brand.
[22:55.720 --> 22:59.960]  Right. Because it was like their favorite store is there as kids and teenagers.
[22:59.960 --> 23:03.520]  And same thing with AMC, where it's like, hey, I loved going to movies.
[23:03.520 --> 23:05.080]  I can't wait to go back to movies.
[23:05.080 --> 23:08.160]  I don't want AMC to go bankrupt, you know? Yeah. Yeah.
[23:08.160 --> 23:10.240]  Blackberry, I don't get. I don't get it.
[23:10.240 --> 23:11.120]  No, I don't get that.
[23:11.120 --> 23:15.160]  That seems like that one's just sort of
[23:15.160 --> 23:20.080]  that we picked the random one because we were like to show that we're funny.
[23:21.080 --> 23:23.320]  I guess. To show we have a sense of humor.
[23:23.320 --> 23:26.560]  Because Blackberry isn't really even Blackberry anymore.
[23:26.560 --> 23:29.320]  You know what I mean? Like AMC is still AMC.
[23:29.320 --> 23:30.600]  They still have the theaters.
[23:30.600 --> 23:33.760]  So like, let's say we all get vaccinated and COVID,
[23:33.760 --> 23:37.720]  you know, goes away as we hope it will as as 2021 progresses.
[23:38.000 --> 23:41.120]  When we go back to movie theaters, it will be, you know,
[23:41.120 --> 23:46.440]  and it looks like this whole crazy scheme might have saved AMC from going bankrupt.
[23:46.960 --> 23:49.840]  We'll be able to go see the James Bond movie later this year.
[23:49.840 --> 23:52.680]  And it'll be like like you used to be.
[23:52.680 --> 23:55.960]  It used to be. Whereas Blackberry isn't even Blackberry anymore.
[23:55.960 --> 23:58.480]  If they don't run, it's not like you can still go
[23:58.480 --> 24:02.080]  buy a Blackberry running the Blackberry operating system.
[24:02.080 --> 24:05.360]  It's just like a brand that sells Android phones.
[24:05.360 --> 24:07.480]  And I don't even know if they even have keyboards anymore,
[24:07.480 --> 24:10.120]  which was like the whole point. Yeah. Yeah.
[24:11.000 --> 24:13.600]  I it's almost surprising that they exist.
[24:14.160 --> 24:15.800]  It's like, yeah.
[24:15.800 --> 24:20.120]  Well, yeah, I mean, they have gone out of business and almost everything, but
[24:20.120 --> 24:22.560]  it's actually going out of business.
[24:23.160 --> 24:27.040]  It's do you remember mimeographs like as a. Oh, yeah.
[24:27.320 --> 24:30.000]  Yeah. Hand that out and you'd smell it. Yeah, that was great.
[24:30.000 --> 24:31.760]  When we for those of you who are too young,
[24:33.120 --> 24:36.360]  there used to be a copying technology called mimeographs.
[24:36.360 --> 24:40.040]  And it was sort of a photo chemical photo.
[24:40.120 --> 24:43.200]  You know, it was a chemical based process rather than
[24:44.440 --> 24:47.480]  purely electronic before before there were copy machines
[24:47.480 --> 24:50.120]  in every school in the nation.
[24:50.400 --> 24:54.280]  They used this technology, which you would just write it on particular,
[24:54.280 --> 24:57.520]  write whatever you wanted to make copies of on a particular kind of,
[24:57.520 --> 24:59.160]  you know, the mimeograph paper.
[24:59.160 --> 25:01.600]  And then you could run it through like a printing press
[25:02.160 --> 25:04.240]  sort of thing, like a roller.
[25:04.240 --> 25:06.720]  Yeah, and it would come out blue, right?
[25:06.720 --> 25:08.080]  Ours were always blue.
[25:08.080 --> 25:12.600]  And when they were fresh, they would have a very pleasant sort of.
[25:12.960 --> 25:15.600]  Yeah. You know, you get a little high off of it,
[25:15.600 --> 25:17.840]  not like really high, but but it was just like
[25:18.720 --> 25:23.160]  it was a weird chemical smell that like if somebody broke a smelling salt
[25:23.160 --> 25:26.480]  for somebody who passed out and gave it to the passed out person.
[25:26.480 --> 25:29.520]  And then after they got the bulk of it, you took like a second
[25:29.520 --> 25:32.040]  hand hit off the smellings.
[25:32.760 --> 25:35.640]  But it was a real thing, like kids, you know, they pass them out.
[25:35.640 --> 25:39.360]  And, you know, if the teacher hadn't made the mimeograph until right before class,
[25:39.360 --> 25:41.440]  it would be fresh. And it was a very pleasant smell.
[25:41.640 --> 25:44.560]  It's like Blackberry still being alive is like
[25:44.560 --> 25:48.160]  if there was still a mimeograph company, right?
[25:48.160 --> 25:52.480]  It's like that it doesn't even make sense anymore. Yeah.
[25:56.080 --> 25:59.800]  I bought I have to admit, I bought I bought a bit of GameStop
[25:59.960 --> 26:01.880]  on Thursday morning.
[26:03.520 --> 26:08.200]  So I heard just just just to have some skin in the game, you know,
[26:09.680 --> 26:12.960]  and I have to say it was very distracting.
[26:12.960 --> 26:17.080]  I saw you. You want to go into what you bought it for and what it's at now?
[26:17.760 --> 26:20.800]  I bought it at 360.
[26:20.800 --> 26:24.280]  It's at 330 right now as of and I didn't sell any of it.
[26:24.280 --> 26:25.200]  So I still have it.
[26:25.200 --> 26:29.880]  I bought some at 360 and then it it jumped up to like 480.
[26:29.880 --> 26:32.160]  And I was like thinking about selling
[26:33.440 --> 26:34.760]  because I was like, that's pretty cool.
[26:34.760 --> 26:37.440]  And then I could and I was like, well, let's see if it gets to 500.
[26:37.440 --> 26:43.280]  And then and then like an hour later, it was 112 and plummeting.
[26:46.040 --> 26:49.840]  And I, you know, I didn't buy a lot, but I bought enough,
[26:49.840 --> 26:52.320]  you know, but, you know, like as much as I would
[26:52.320 --> 26:55.160]  maybe take in my pocket to a casino to play some blackjack.
[26:55.640 --> 26:59.600]  And, you know, but enough that that which is enough that I don't want to lose it all.
[27:00.240 --> 27:03.400]  Which is when it went from four hundred
[27:03.400 --> 27:07.600]  to three hundred to two hundred down to heading close, you know, rocketing
[27:07.600 --> 27:12.560]  towards one hundred, it really started looking like you might end up with zero,
[27:12.720 --> 27:15.160]  which is, you know, what can happen when you play blackjack?
[27:15.160 --> 27:17.080]  Not what you think when you buy a stock, right?
[27:17.080 --> 27:20.440]  You go buy some Apple stock and you don't look at it for a year.
[27:20.720 --> 27:24.440]  Maybe it's up, maybe it's down, but it's not going to be zero. Right.
[27:24.800 --> 27:27.200]  Well, the GameStop seemed like it could have been zero.
[27:28.080 --> 27:30.160]  But then I did buy some more
[27:30.160 --> 27:34.040]  to even out my position at around, I think, around two thirty.
[27:34.040 --> 27:39.000]  So the average of the shares that I hold are three hundred and one dollar.
[27:39.000 --> 27:40.200]  So call it three hundred.
[27:40.200 --> 27:44.560]  And now that it's three thirty, I'm overall I'm above I'm above water.
[27:44.880 --> 27:49.600]  OK, probably there is a piece in The Washington Post about this kid
[27:49.600 --> 27:54.040]  in San Antonio whose mom gave him 10 shares of GameStop.
[27:54.920 --> 27:57.760]  And she was, you know, in 2019 for Kwanzaa.
[27:57.760 --> 28:02.400]  And she was just, you know, like trying to she wanted to give him a present
[28:02.400 --> 28:05.320]  and she wanted to give him something that, you know, as a kid,
[28:05.320 --> 28:07.480]  he loved to go to GameStop, stop to buy games all the time.
[28:07.480 --> 28:10.800]  And so she was like, oh, there's, you know, there's a company that he enjoys.
[28:10.800 --> 28:13.480]  I'm going to get him some stock in this company to teach him
[28:13.480 --> 28:15.320]  a little bit about the stock market.
[28:15.320 --> 28:19.840]  And so she bought 10 shares at six dollars and nineteen cents.
[28:19.840 --> 28:23.440]  And he sold them.
[28:23.440 --> 28:25.120]  So, you know, so it goes up like crazy.
[28:25.120 --> 28:28.080]  It goes up to like three twenty. And she's like, hey, did you see this?
[28:28.080 --> 28:31.040]  And he's like and she was she wanted to make sure that it was his decision
[28:31.040 --> 28:34.000]  about what to do. And she was like, I was really hoping he would say sell.
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.880]  And so he sold he sold at three twenty.
[28:36.880 --> 28:40.560]  So, you know, he got like like thirty one hundred bucks out of this.
[28:40.560 --> 28:42.800]  That's amazing. Wow. What a great story.
[28:42.800 --> 28:45.120]  I will put it in the show notes, I promise.
[28:45.120 --> 28:49.120]  That's fantastic. But it's so great.
[28:49.120 --> 28:50.080]  What a great story.
[28:50.080 --> 28:54.000]  But perhaps, perhaps this one is going to be a great story.
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.840]  Perhaps this might be damaging to the young man's viewpoint of it.
[28:57.840 --> 28:59.040]  Well, yeah, that's yeah.
[28:59.040 --> 29:00.640]  She talked about that, too.
[29:00.640 --> 29:07.440]  She she made very, very clear that this is not a usual event.
[29:08.400 --> 29:10.560]  You turned 16.
[29:10.560 --> 29:13.040]  Don't get used to this.
[29:13.040 --> 29:17.040]  Well, there's the guy who's the main I'm not going to say instigator
[29:17.040 --> 29:19.040]  because I don't think he's I don't think he's done anything wrong.
[29:19.040 --> 29:23.840]  But the promoter of GameStop is this guy on Reddit's Wall Street
[29:23.840 --> 29:26.080]  Bets, who goes under the name.
[29:28.240 --> 29:28.800]  What is it?
[29:28.800 --> 29:32.560]  It's it's got the fucking value, big fucking value, something like that.
[29:32.560 --> 29:37.440]  And now he's he's been he's I don't know if he got exposed or he chose to.
[29:37.440 --> 29:40.960]  But, you know, the Wall Street Journal had an interview with the real guy.
[29:40.960 --> 29:45.200]  But anyway, he put fifty thousand dollars into GameStop back in April.
[29:45.840 --> 29:52.160]  And his his position now is like 40 million or something like that.
[29:52.160 --> 29:55.600]  It's like he cashed out a bit to have 13 million in cash
[29:56.560 --> 30:00.080]  and is still holding the rest, which is fascinating.
[30:02.880 --> 30:05.040]  But not a bad way to do it.
[30:05.040 --> 30:05.280]  Right.
[30:05.280 --> 30:10.000]  Because then if like, you know what I mean, like it that, you know, if he still believes
[30:10.000 --> 30:12.080]  in it, that the stock could go higher.
[30:12.080 --> 30:13.680]  That's it's not a bad way to do it.
[30:13.680 --> 30:15.120]  Put a little cash in your pocket.
[30:15.120 --> 30:15.440]  Right.
[30:15.440 --> 30:18.320]  Thirteen million from fifty thousand starting point.
[30:18.320 --> 30:21.040]  If that's all you if that's really what he walks away with.
[30:21.040 --> 30:23.920]  You know, he's still that rags to riches story.
[30:23.920 --> 30:25.040]  I mean, not that he I don't know.
[30:25.040 --> 30:26.800]  I don't think he was in rags, but.
[30:26.800 --> 30:29.280]  No, I'm sure he wasn't.
[30:29.840 --> 30:31.760]  Let's say average Joe to riches.
[30:31.760 --> 30:37.040]  Well, thirteen million dollars in cash is is, you know, it's a lot of money to most people.
[30:38.400 --> 30:40.640]  You know, 40 million seems like more.
[30:40.640 --> 30:45.440]  I would be very tempted to have sold at some point along the way.
[30:45.440 --> 30:54.320]  But, you know, but not most people aren't making that type of money, but no, I just
[30:54.320 --> 30:55.120]  wanted to follow.
[30:55.120 --> 30:58.400]  And I get I mean, it seems like I mean, I'm sure that a lot of people are excited about
[30:58.400 --> 31:02.800]  making a lot of money, but it also seems like these guys are just mostly a lot of them are
[31:02.800 --> 31:04.240]  sticking a finger in somebody's eye.
[31:04.880 --> 31:10.000]  Yeah, there's definitely a part of that where they're, you know, and the idea is that the
[31:10.000 --> 31:15.840]  one of the ideas is that GameStop has been unfairly maligned by the short sellers and
[31:15.840 --> 31:20.240]  that these these hedge funds pounce on troubled stocks.
[31:20.240 --> 31:30.560]  And you can see why why and their GameStop in particular seemed open to this attack because
[31:30.560 --> 31:40.160]  the the short sellers story is true, which is basically, hey, it's COVID reach that GameStop
[31:40.160 --> 31:43.600]  is a physical retailer with all the all these positions.
[31:43.600 --> 31:47.280]  Physical retail is already hurting before COVID.
[31:47.280 --> 31:50.800]  COVID is death to physical retail, literally.
[31:50.800 --> 31:54.080]  I mean, it's you know, because people are staying home and they're supposed to stay
[31:54.080 --> 31:54.720]  home.
[31:54.720 --> 32:00.800]  And the larger trend in the video game industry is towards downloads only and people aren't
[32:00.800 --> 32:01.520]  buying discs.
[32:01.520 --> 32:04.240]  And that's the whole thing that GameStop is about.
[32:04.240 --> 32:06.880]  And so that rings it is true to some degree.
[32:07.600 --> 32:09.600]  And so it sounds true to other people.
[32:09.600 --> 32:12.480]  And so when they say, you know, you should short this stock because they're going to
[32:12.480 --> 32:14.320]  go bankrupt, it rings true.
[32:14.320 --> 32:18.480]  But when you actually look at GameStop's numbers, it's not that bad.
[32:18.480 --> 32:21.200]  You know, it's like and they had a strong holiday quarter.
[32:21.200 --> 32:25.920]  You know, so there's some truth that that they're they might be more resilient than
[32:25.920 --> 32:32.880]  it to this, then that storyline would have you that bankruptcy may not be on on the you
[32:32.880 --> 32:33.840]  know, in their future.
[32:34.400 --> 32:37.920]  Well, in part, in part of the problem with the hedge funds, you know, stuff that they
[32:37.920 --> 32:39.840]  do is it creates kind of a feeding frenzy.
[32:39.840 --> 32:40.160]  Right.
[32:40.160 --> 32:40.880]  Right.
[32:40.880 --> 32:41.840]  It does take them here.
[32:41.840 --> 32:45.920]  They're not generally not doing it based on absolutely nothing.
[32:45.920 --> 32:50.800]  But it becomes a fait accompli because they all get together and they do the same thing.
[32:50.800 --> 32:54.560]  And that drives the stock down and then they cash out and they make their money.
[32:54.560 --> 32:54.800]  Right.
[32:54.800 --> 33:00.000]  And when there's a very short, succinct story that you can tell in 30 seconds during a hit
[33:00.000 --> 33:03.680]  on CNBC, it's more compelling.
[33:03.680 --> 33:05.840]  And hey, COVID hurts physical retailers.
[33:05.840 --> 33:09.600]  GameStop's a physical retailer and kids are moving towards digital downloads.
[33:09.600 --> 33:10.160]  End of story.
[33:10.160 --> 33:11.040]  They're going bankrupt.
[33:11.040 --> 33:12.240]  And it's like, oh, that sounds good.
[33:12.880 --> 33:19.680]  You know, as people who follow Apple, we I think we are in not necessarily unique position,
[33:19.680 --> 33:24.800]  but we are in a good position to recognize the fact that a lot of the activity that happens
[33:24.800 --> 33:31.280]  on Wall Street is based on a bunch of crap that people are making up or are ill informed
[33:31.280 --> 33:31.920]  about.
[33:31.920 --> 33:33.440]  Yeah, that's very true.
[33:33.440 --> 33:35.840]  You know, and again, I'm not an investment expert.
[33:35.840 --> 33:40.720]  Trust me, you know, you have more of a background in this and you know more about how the stock
[33:40.720 --> 33:41.520]  market really works.
[33:41.520 --> 33:49.200]  But I do know the basics of how Apple in particular over the last 25 years.
[33:49.200 --> 33:50.320]  Oh, maybe 30 years.
[33:50.320 --> 33:58.480]  You know, maybe the whole history of the company has largely been valued unfairly on the market.
[33:58.480 --> 34:01.920]  And even even at the point now where maybe they're valued too high.
[34:01.920 --> 34:02.160]  Right.
[34:02.160 --> 34:03.920]  Maybe they're part of an overall bubble.
[34:05.280 --> 34:12.160]  But the basic idea of price to earnings, you know, where the average company over the last
[34:12.160 --> 34:16.560]  100 years in the S&P 500 has had a price to earnings of around I think it's like 19.
[34:16.560 --> 34:17.520]  But let's call it $20.
[34:18.080 --> 34:18.480]  Right.
[34:18.480 --> 34:24.480]  So it's like, however profitable you are, your stock price is sort of like a 20 times
[34:24.480 --> 34:26.800]  factor on earnings per share.
[34:26.800 --> 34:29.360]  I think that's that's what price to earnings ratio is.
[34:29.360 --> 34:29.600]  Right.
[34:30.560 --> 34:30.800]  Yeah.
[34:32.080 --> 34:33.600]  And you know, I don't know that.
[34:34.960 --> 34:37.200]  That sounds like that's the way it should be.
[34:37.200 --> 34:37.520]  Right.
[34:37.520 --> 34:45.520]  But for for a long, long stretch, Apple was always valued way under $20 price to earnings.
[34:45.520 --> 34:45.760]  Yeah.
[34:45.760 --> 34:50.160]  Because the narrative was, ah, this company is on, you know, they're in trouble.
[34:50.160 --> 34:53.600]  They're, you know, even when they weren't, they're going to go out of business.
[34:55.040 --> 34:55.280]  Right.
[34:55.280 --> 35:00.160]  And every time they had a hit, it would be like, ah, you know, like the iPod is a great
[35:00.160 --> 35:04.640]  example, because the iPod we can talk about as it's over.
[35:04.640 --> 35:04.960]  Right.
[35:04.960 --> 35:06.560]  It it happened.
[35:06.560 --> 35:11.600]  And it was a not a flash, but it was sort of a decade, a decade long thing.
[35:11.600 --> 35:11.840]  Right.
[35:11.840 --> 35:13.440]  It appeared in 2001.
[35:13.440 --> 35:17.920]  It was Mac only and Mac only until like 2003.
[35:18.880 --> 35:23.840]  And then I think it was around 2003, maybe 2004, when they they had the added the Windows
[35:23.840 --> 35:30.240]  support with iTunes and and, you know, digital music really, really took off.
[35:31.120 --> 35:34.480]  And they had a couple of years where it was a true sensation.
[35:34.480 --> 35:41.520]  And I always remember I just remember being at the mall and hearing people, kids talk
[35:41.520 --> 35:48.560]  about going to the iPod store and it'd be like, you kids, you know, I mean, this is
[35:48.560 --> 35:49.200]  20 years ago.
[35:49.200 --> 35:54.240]  So I was like, you know, 29 years old and I already felt like an old man.
[35:54.240 --> 35:58.880]  You kids, that's the Apple store, the iPod store.
[35:58.880 --> 36:00.000]  But it became a thing.
[36:01.040 --> 36:06.000]  But when it became a thing that like the narrative was that Dell's going to come out with it
[36:06.000 --> 36:09.440]  with the thing, you know, Microsoft's going to come out with a thing and then and nobody's
[36:09.440 --> 36:12.880]  going to buy these expensive ones from Apple, there's going to be cheap ones from other
[36:12.880 --> 36:13.440]  companies.
[36:13.440 --> 36:15.200]  And and it never happened.
[36:15.200 --> 36:15.520]  Right.
[36:15.520 --> 36:21.760]  But but their stock never really took the value of the iPod because the narrative was
[36:21.760 --> 36:25.760]  at any given moment, the iPod was going to just poof, the bubbles going to be replaced.
[36:25.760 --> 36:26.560]  But yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:26.560 --> 36:27.920]  Get beaten by Microsoft.
[36:27.920 --> 36:28.320]  Yeah, yeah.
[36:28.320 --> 36:29.520]  I mean, the rumor there was a rumor.
[36:29.520 --> 36:36.560]  I remember I still remember this, that that Microsoft was going to give you the value
[36:36.560 --> 36:42.480]  of whatever music you had already purchased on, like, just give it to you somehow, like
[36:42.480 --> 36:48.320]  magically transfer whatever you had already purchased onto the the the Zune when it came
[36:48.320 --> 36:48.560]  out.
[36:49.200 --> 36:50.480]  And of course, that never happened.
[36:50.480 --> 36:54.000]  I mean, you had to buy you had to get a subscription or you had to buy it all over again to get
[36:54.000 --> 36:54.800]  it on digital.
[36:55.760 --> 36:58.240]  But it was just like, yeah, but it was that that kind of thinking.
[36:58.240 --> 37:02.400]  It was like, you know, it's Microsoft is too mighty, and there's no way that Apple is
[37:02.400 --> 37:06.240]  going to be able to keep up when Microsoft introduces whatever they're going to bring
[37:06.240 --> 37:06.880]  the market.
[37:06.880 --> 37:07.200]  Right.
[37:07.200 --> 37:11.120]  And that basically Apple's only core audience was a cult.
[37:11.920 --> 37:12.160]  Yeah.
[37:12.160 --> 37:12.480]  All right.
[37:12.480 --> 37:14.400]  I mean, there's even the site Cult of Mac.
[37:14.400 --> 37:20.480]  I mean, it's like it's, you know, been there for a while, but it's no exaggeration to say
[37:20.480 --> 37:24.400]  that that was the narrative on Wall Street was that the people who buy Macintosh computers
[37:24.400 --> 37:26.240]  were cultists, you know?
[37:26.240 --> 37:26.560]  Yeah.
[37:26.560 --> 37:31.440]  Because because they couldn't see any other reason why why people would be buying these
[37:31.440 --> 37:37.680]  other computers that that don't accept DOS floppies.
[37:37.680 --> 37:40.720]  I put my floppy disk in and it said I wanted to format it.
[37:40.720 --> 37:42.640]  What's the VGA porn on that laptop?
[37:42.640 --> 37:42.880]  Right.
[37:44.480 --> 37:45.760]  These people are in a cult.
[37:46.320 --> 37:46.560]  Yeah.
[37:48.960 --> 37:50.320]  The trackpad works.
[37:50.320 --> 37:51.200]  What the hell is that?
[37:53.680 --> 37:54.640]  What kind of crazy?
[37:55.280 --> 37:56.400]  It's unsustainable.
[37:57.920 --> 37:59.840]  What kind of crazy laptop is this?
[37:59.840 --> 38:02.560]  It actually wakes up from sleep.
[38:05.040 --> 38:09.600]  My computer shuts down if I leave the lid closed for 10 minutes, just like God intended.
[38:14.640 --> 38:21.520]  But the thing so that it's a weird story to follow because I love the idea that they are,
[38:21.520 --> 38:24.320]  you know, sticking your finger in the eye of these hedge funds.
[38:25.040 --> 38:27.360]  But at the same time, you can easily see how
[38:27.360 --> 38:32.560]  it in this maybe example of one, but I don't even know.
[38:32.560 --> 38:35.520]  I guess I don't know exactly how it all started necessarily.
[38:35.520 --> 38:40.720]  But you can see how this can be particularly after our experience in the 2016 election.
[38:41.280 --> 38:42.720]  This could be weaponized, right?
[38:44.160 --> 38:54.320]  How how actors from foreign states or, you know, just bad people can influence people
[38:54.320 --> 38:59.280]  on online forums and other places and try and get them to do stuff like this,
[38:59.280 --> 39:01.840]  thinking that they're doing something that's cute and funny or
[39:01.840 --> 39:05.600]  or even a social good and pointed in the wrong direction.
[39:07.440 --> 39:08.400]  Yeah, absolutely.
[39:08.400 --> 39:15.840]  You know, and especially now, maybe not especially, but, you know, it read it in particular
[39:17.040 --> 39:21.200]  is I've never been big, a big Reddit user.
[39:21.200 --> 39:22.240]  Yeah, me either.
[39:22.240 --> 39:26.640]  I mean, in fact, the opposite. I'm a very rare and occasional Reddit user.
[39:27.760 --> 39:33.040]  But like the culture of Reddit is a complete anonymity.
[39:33.040 --> 39:38.320]  Like as far as I can tell, nobody on I might be the only person on all of Reddit who uses
[39:38.320 --> 39:46.960]  their actual name like I think I signed up when I was logged in because I was looking
[39:46.960 --> 39:50.800]  at Wall Street bets this week and it says I've signed up 15 years ago.
[39:50.800 --> 39:53.120]  So I don't know if that's early, how early that is.
[39:53.120 --> 39:56.480]  But, you know, but my username on Reddit is just Gruber.
[39:57.120 --> 40:01.840]  I've got like one I've got one karma point, but I've been there for 15 years.
[40:01.840 --> 40:04.640]  As far as I can tell, nobody on Reddit uses their name.
[40:04.640 --> 40:05.360]  I don't know.
[40:05.360 --> 40:08.240]  I mean, I but when I signed up, I didn't know.
[40:08.240 --> 40:11.840]  And I no longer know what made up name I would use.
[40:12.480 --> 40:18.400]  I mean, Daring Fireball wouldn't exactly hide my no hide my identity.
[40:18.400 --> 40:24.160]  But, you know, and I know that there's lots of people, a lot of people on Twitter,
[40:24.160 --> 40:28.400]  including some of my favorite people who I follow who don't use their real name.
[40:29.440 --> 40:33.440]  You know, it's Darth, for example, who might be the single one I think of.
[40:33.440 --> 40:33.680]  Right.
[40:33.680 --> 40:38.800]  The single greatest Twitter user in the world maybe does not use his real name.
[40:39.840 --> 40:41.520]  And it doesn't make him less credible.
[40:41.520 --> 40:43.360]  I think it's great that you don't have to.
[40:43.360 --> 40:47.520]  I think Twitter would be for the worse if they, you know, if they had originally had
[40:47.520 --> 40:48.960]  a real names only policy.
[40:50.400 --> 40:54.960]  But the fact that no one on Reddit uses their real name does seem to make it even more likely
[40:54.960 --> 40:56.400]  to be like, how would you know?
[40:57.120 --> 41:01.840]  How would you tell if it's foreign actors, you know, or people with the bad intent of
[41:01.840 --> 41:03.600]  attempting to crash the stock market?
[41:04.880 --> 41:05.380]  Yeah.
[41:06.480 --> 41:06.960]  It's very.
[41:08.000 --> 41:09.120]  Yeah, I was lost.
[41:09.120 --> 41:14.560]  The other thing I said was that there are now there are like 6.3 million subscribers
[41:14.560 --> 41:19.280]  to wall street bets and half of them subscribe since Wednesday.
[41:22.720 --> 41:24.800]  It's a very weird board.
[41:24.800 --> 41:26.560]  Did you take a look at it at all?
[41:26.560 --> 41:30.480]  I mean, now just the stuff that's been posted in articles I had, I don't think I've gone
[41:30.480 --> 41:31.280]  there directly.
[41:31.280 --> 41:32.400]  Oh man, it is.
[41:33.120 --> 41:33.760]  It's crazy.
[41:34.880 --> 41:39.200]  I kind of see how people are into it, but it's like, it's too frenetic for me.
[41:39.200 --> 41:39.760]  Yeah.
[41:39.760 --> 41:40.260]  Yeah.
[41:40.720 --> 41:42.000]  But I love, I love it.
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.720]  And they have their own kind of cultural language almost.
[41:44.720 --> 41:45.520]  Yeah, I love it.
[41:45.520 --> 41:51.440]  So they call it, what they want, with the basic idea that the hardcore users of it,
[41:51.440 --> 41:56.800]  they want you to buy GameStop and AMC and hold.
[41:56.800 --> 42:00.960]  Just buy some and hold it, and it's going to drive the share price higher.
[42:00.960 --> 42:03.280]  And we're going to, you know, we're all going to get rich.
[42:03.280 --> 42:09.520]  And they post a bunch of rocket ship emojis to show that it's going to, I swear, this
[42:09.520 --> 42:10.240]  is part of the lingo.
[42:10.240 --> 42:14.400]  It's like, there's like going to the moon, going to the moon is good, but going to Alpha
[42:14.400 --> 42:16.480]  Centauri is like, that's where they want it to go.
[42:16.480 --> 42:19.440]  Like, because they want GameStop to go to like 4,000.
[42:21.200 --> 42:22.960]  I swear, I mean, I don't think, I don't know.
[42:23.760 --> 42:26.880]  Well, you laugh, but it was, I know, I know.
[42:26.880 --> 42:30.640]  But it was at like, it was at like $12 a month ago, and now it's at $300.
[42:30.640 --> 42:36.640]  So I don't know, could it, you know, it's gone up 30 times in a month, you know, maybe
[42:36.640 --> 42:37.840]  it could go up 10 times more.
[42:37.840 --> 42:39.920]  I don't know if this is what they want, but they call it.
[42:39.920 --> 42:42.480]  But buying and holding, they call it diamond hands.
[42:44.000 --> 42:45.200]  And if you, that's what that was.
[42:45.200 --> 42:46.960]  Yeah, I saw that reference a few times.
[42:46.960 --> 42:48.960]  Yeah, that's, that's diamond hands.
[42:48.960 --> 42:52.240]  And what you don't want to have is paper hands, paper hands.
[42:52.240 --> 42:57.040]  Paper hands would be like, let's say like when I bought, when I bought my, my GameStop
[42:57.040 --> 42:59.920]  at $300 and it went up to $480.
[42:59.920 --> 43:04.240]  If I had paper hands, I would have sold right there for, for a nice, a nice win.
[43:04.800 --> 43:08.400]  But I don't see, yeah, but I don't want to have paper hands, you know, I want diamond
[43:08.400 --> 43:11.200]  hands, so I got the, I'm in with the kids.
[43:11.200 --> 43:12.960]  I got diamond hands, John.
[43:12.960 --> 43:13.440]  I'm old.
[43:16.000 --> 43:19.600]  But I sat there, I'm sitting there thinking, you know, and again, this is not an investment
[43:19.600 --> 43:19.920]  for me.
[43:19.920 --> 43:21.920]  This is recreational gambling.
[43:21.920 --> 43:28.320]  But I am, it did occur to me, well, wait, if I don't sell at $400 or $450, well, what
[43:28.320 --> 43:30.080]  am I, what am I doing?
[43:30.080 --> 43:31.360]  Yeah, right.
[43:31.360 --> 43:34.800]  And that's, that's a question for all of these people, right?
[43:34.800 --> 43:36.560]  I mean, what's the end game here?
[43:36.560 --> 43:41.120]  Because it doesn't seem like, I mean, maybe it does go up to something, some crazy value
[43:41.120 --> 43:47.520]  like 4,000, but fundamentally, I don't think it's a $4,000 per share stock.
[43:47.520 --> 43:50.000]  No, I don't, I think, I think
[43:50.000 --> 43:51.440]  And it's got to come back down.
[43:51.440 --> 43:57.360]  And when it comes back down, like somebody's going to be left carrying a hole in the back.
[43:57.360 --> 43:58.960]  Yeah, there's no doubt about it.
[43:58.960 --> 44:07.200]  I mean, again, somebody's going to have shit, somebody's going to have shit hands.
[44:07.200 --> 44:12.160]  Somebody's going to have to wipe their ass with the free newspaper at the corner because
[44:12.160 --> 44:13.600]  they can't buy toilet paper anymore.
[44:14.880 --> 44:16.480]  So I guess they would have shit hands.
[44:16.480 --> 44:17.360]  I don't know.
[44:17.360 --> 44:21.200]  I never thought of that as like a, it's like a last ditch.
[44:21.200 --> 44:22.320]  You get the free newspaper.
[44:22.320 --> 44:22.640]  Yeah.
[44:22.640 --> 44:22.800]  Yeah.
[44:23.760 --> 44:26.800]  I mean, like, it doesn't, it would be hard for me because I'd have to walk far, but I
[44:26.800 --> 44:27.280]  could do it.
[44:27.280 --> 44:30.320]  But remember when we couldn't buy toilet paper?
[44:30.880 --> 44:31.520]  Yeah, I know.
[44:31.520 --> 44:31.920]  Yeah.
[44:31.920 --> 44:32.720]  Wasn't that a thing?
[44:32.720 --> 44:36.400]  Wasn't that a thing you'd never expected in life and in America?
[44:37.840 --> 44:38.400]  Yeah.
[44:38.400 --> 44:40.080]  A mass toilet paper shortage.
[44:42.720 --> 44:43.440]  You know what, though?
[44:43.440 --> 44:45.760]  It was a similar mania though, right?
[44:45.760 --> 44:47.440]  It's like that herd mentality.
[44:47.440 --> 44:51.520]  Like, because there are people bought like, and I have members of my family and when we
[44:52.480 --> 44:56.240]  wound up placing enough orders, we didn't, we were at the tail end of it.
[44:56.240 --> 45:01.040]  You know, like we didn't load up early, but once we had trouble getting toilet paper,
[45:01.040 --> 45:05.040]  we placed orders, you know, like walmart.com and amazon.com.
[45:05.040 --> 45:08.480]  And it was at a time when they were saying, don't even leave the house.
[45:08.480 --> 45:13.680]  And we wound up getting more toilet paper to keep in the basement than we'd normally
[45:13.680 --> 45:15.680]  have, but not massive amounts.
[45:15.680 --> 45:20.800]  But I have family members who went to Costco and like loaded up their SUVs with toilet
[45:20.800 --> 45:21.520]  paper.
[45:21.520 --> 45:21.760]  Yeah.
[45:21.760 --> 45:25.600]  And we're like, you know, like Amy would be like, I don't think you need that much.
[45:25.600 --> 45:27.280]  What do you think is going to happen?
[45:27.280 --> 45:29.440]  Like people, people are pooping more.
[45:29.440 --> 45:30.480]  I don't know.
[45:30.480 --> 45:37.040]  Well, no, I think somehow it was just this, this weird cycle of everybody saying there's
[45:37.040 --> 45:41.200]  a toilet paper shortage and somebody like went to a store and they weren't, they literally
[45:41.200 --> 45:45.840]  were out of toilet paper, had nothing but like the worst toilet paper imaginable, you
[45:45.840 --> 45:48.080]  know, like brand name, worst toilet paper.
[45:49.040 --> 45:49.520]  Yeah.
[45:49.520 --> 45:50.160]  Prison toilet paper.
[45:50.160 --> 45:51.760]  And that happened, that did happen to us.
[45:51.760 --> 45:55.840]  We had one point where there was like, we had some toilet paper that was kind of sketchy,
[45:55.840 --> 45:57.440]  but that was the worst.
[45:57.440 --> 45:59.200]  You know, that was the worst that happened.
[45:59.200 --> 46:03.040]  And because we, you know, cause we go to Costco and so we get it at Costco.
[46:03.040 --> 46:07.760]  And so we usually have way more toilet paper than we really need at any given moment.
[46:07.760 --> 46:10.000]  But there were people buying pickup trucks full of it.
[46:10.000 --> 46:13.280]  And then, you know, like I remember early on, like when this was happening, I had to
[46:13.280 --> 46:14.800]  go pick up a prescription.
[46:14.800 --> 46:19.200]  And so I was at our CVS down the street and, and I went to, you know, I was like, well,
[46:19.200 --> 46:21.520]  let's see if they have any toilet paper and maybe I'll pick some up.
[46:21.520 --> 46:26.960]  You know, cause, and I went and they literally had nothing, but like, uh, you know, like
[46:26.960 --> 46:32.160]  one sketchy, yes, we have some paper towels too.
[46:32.160 --> 46:37.360]  Cause paper towels were running low and we got some, some really bad tape paper towels.
[46:37.360 --> 46:42.400]  And then, you know, now everything normal, normal out and, uh, we don't have, but we
[46:42.400 --> 46:45.920]  still have some of this really cheap paper towels that we use for cleaning.
[46:45.920 --> 46:49.520]  You know, it's like, well, that, you know, let's not let it go to waste, but these paper
[46:49.520 --> 46:52.960]  towels, when they get wet, they, they dissolve.
[46:53.920 --> 46:56.960]  Like they're not just bad paper towels there.
[46:56.960 --> 47:00.320]  They're like, what are you supposed to use it for?
[47:00.320 --> 47:03.120]  If getting wet at all makes it dissolve.
[47:04.480 --> 47:08.960]  Do you ever have, did you ever get those, those there's like eco-friendly, uh, packing
[47:08.960 --> 47:12.640]  material that, that they even tell you, you can put it, if you'd like to, you can just
[47:12.640 --> 47:14.880]  put it in a bucket, fill it with water and it'll dissolve.
[47:14.880 --> 47:15.040]  Oh yeah.
[47:15.040 --> 47:15.680]  Yeah.
[47:15.680 --> 47:16.080]  Yeah.
[47:16.080 --> 47:16.560]  Yeah.
[47:16.560 --> 47:17.760]  I ate one of those.
[47:17.760 --> 47:19.600]  I did too, cause they said you can.
[47:19.600 --> 47:20.640]  Cause they said you could eat it.
[47:20.640 --> 47:20.960]  Yeah.
[47:20.960 --> 47:22.480]  And I gave one to the dog too.
[47:25.200 --> 47:26.400]  This is why we're pals.
[47:27.760 --> 47:28.960]  My wife was like, what are you doing?
[47:28.960 --> 47:34.000]  If you get sick, if you get sick, I'm never going to let you forget this.
[47:34.000 --> 47:35.520]  And I'm like, well, they say you can eat it.
[47:35.520 --> 47:38.720]  And, and, you know, but that's what these paper towels are made out of.
[47:38.720 --> 47:40.240]  They, they, you just get them wet.
[47:40.240 --> 47:43.200]  It's like, what do you, all we ever do with paper towels is clean up spills.
[47:43.200 --> 47:50.960]  You know, it anyway, uh, well anyway, then it leads us to, we got to talk about this
[47:50.960 --> 47:52.720]  Robin hood company, chimney Christ.
[47:52.720 --> 47:52.720]  Yeah.
[47:54.640 --> 47:56.000]  Do we need a disclosure?
[47:56.000 --> 47:59.200]  They used to advertise on one of my podcasts that long time ago.
[47:59.200 --> 47:59.600]  Oh yeah.
[47:59.600 --> 48:00.400]  That's fair enough.
[48:00.400 --> 48:00.800]  I don't know.
[48:00.800 --> 48:02.320]  They'd never advertise with me though.
[48:02.320 --> 48:11.040]  So screw the hell with, uh, I, even if they had, I, you know, I'd still be this.
[48:11.040 --> 48:12.480]  It's such a bizarre story.
[48:12.480 --> 48:14.640]  They're, they're, they're heading towards an IPO.
[48:14.640 --> 48:16.800]  They're well-funded, they're very popular.
[48:16.800 --> 48:20.320]  They apparently have a very good app, which I haven't been able to use.
[48:20.880 --> 48:24.000]  So I signed up for a Robin hood account five years ago.
[48:24.000 --> 48:28.480]  And I think it was when they were first new, there was like a, uh, our friend, uh, Adam
[48:28.480 --> 48:32.400]  Lisa Gore sandwich video did a nice sandwich video for them and it sounded like a cool
[48:32.400 --> 48:33.040]  thing.
[48:33.040 --> 48:37.520]  So I signed up and it never actually used it though.
[48:37.520 --> 48:41.360]  And then the other day when I was thinking about getting in on this game stuff did before
[48:41.360 --> 48:45.440]  the Robin hood blockade, I thought, well, maybe if I'm just going to goof around, instead
[48:45.440 --> 48:51.040]  of using my real investment account where I, I don't play day trading at all, I just
[48:51.040 --> 48:53.200]  buy some stocks and hold and never look at them.
[48:53.200 --> 48:55.920]  Just index, you know, S and P 500 index funds.
[48:55.920 --> 48:56.240]  Yeah.
[48:56.240 --> 48:58.800]  Why don't I just, why don't I try this Robin hood thing too?
[48:58.800 --> 49:02.400]  I'll put, you know, put a couple hundred bucks in there and play with that.
[49:03.440 --> 49:07.840]  Uh, and I couldn't sign in cause they, I had my username and password and my email
[49:07.840 --> 49:12.000]  address, but they said they wanted to send me an SMS because I hadn't signed in for a
[49:12.000 --> 49:12.800]  long time.
[49:12.800 --> 49:13.600]  And I said, okay.
[49:13.600 --> 49:15.280]  And it just said, it's just a button.
[49:15.280 --> 49:17.680]  How they were like, how would you like to confirm your account?
[49:17.680 --> 49:18.400]  Colon.
[49:18.400 --> 49:22.160]  And there's only one option SMS and I hit yes.
[49:22.160 --> 49:24.960]  And my phone never got an SMS.
[49:24.960 --> 49:25.760]  Nothing happens.
[49:25.760 --> 49:29.520]  And my, I have a Google voice that I was like, maybe I use the Google voice.
[49:29.520 --> 49:34.080]  I often use that, which is a great way to have like a throwaway account that can get
[49:34.080 --> 49:38.480]  and send SMS without having to give people your real cell phone number.
[49:38.480 --> 49:39.200]  Nope, nothing.
[49:39.840 --> 49:44.720]  So my guess is when I signed up, I gave them our landline number, which is what I
[49:44.720 --> 49:47.520]  typically give, you know, that they asked for.
[49:47.520 --> 49:50.240]  They're trying to, they're trying to send a text message to your landline number.
[49:50.240 --> 49:50.560]  Yeah.
[49:50.560 --> 49:50.720]  Right.
[49:50.720 --> 49:52.240]  Which literally isn't even hooked up.
[49:52.240 --> 49:55.120]  We don't even have a phone connected to it.
[49:55.120 --> 50:00.880]  We just have this number and we can use it for billing purposes with no risk of, cause
[50:00.880 --> 50:02.960]  I, you know what, I don't want a phone call from them.
[50:02.960 --> 50:07.600]  But, uh, I sent them a, so they're like, all right, so if you can't log in, what
[50:07.600 --> 50:08.320]  do you need to do?
[50:08.320 --> 50:10.240]  You got to send them an email to support.
[50:11.200 --> 50:19.440]  My guess is that my, my request to have this SMS situation straighten, straighten
[50:19.440 --> 50:23.280]  out is not high on their list right now.
[50:23.280 --> 50:27.920]  I I'm guessing they might have a lot of, a lot of emails in that you'll, you'll get
[50:27.920 --> 50:28.400]  that.
[50:28.400 --> 50:30.880]  You'll get that a response to that when you get a COVID vaccine.
[50:30.880 --> 50:33.040]  Yeah, exactly.
[50:33.680 --> 50:37.360]  So I was not able to use it, but apparently what people say, and I have friends who have
[50:37.360 --> 50:41.200]  accounts there, they say it is a very nice app and I use E-Trade.
[50:41.200 --> 50:46.560]  I have an E-Trade and E-Trades web or apps are, uh, how do you say it?
[50:46.560 --> 50:48.000]  Uh, not good.
[50:48.000 --> 50:48.560]  Not good.
[50:48.560 --> 50:49.040]  Not good.
[50:49.600 --> 50:54.880]  I tried using their iPad app and I don't know how this is even possible, but it seems
[50:54.880 --> 50:59.200]  like, like the fields, like when it says like how many shares would you, you know, what
[50:59.200 --> 51:08.880]  stock GME, how many shares, uh, you know, 30, uh, the fields don't really align with
[51:08.880 --> 51:09.840]  the tap targets.
[51:09.840 --> 51:13.520]  It's like you have to tap above the, uh, not, how do you, I don't even know how you
[51:13.520 --> 51:15.280]  do that in an iOS app.
[51:15.280 --> 51:20.320]  And then the iOS app crashed and I haven't had an app crash in a long time.
[51:20.320 --> 51:24.480]  It just, or at least on iOS, it just doesn't seem to be a big thing anymore.
[51:24.480 --> 51:28.720]  It's, it's clearly meant, E-Trade is still, and then I went to my Mac and just did it
[51:28.720 --> 51:33.120]  on the web and their website, it's not, it's very, they have a lot going on, but
[51:33.120 --> 51:36.880]  it's, it works and I can understand it and it's a lot faster than the app.
[51:36.880 --> 51:42.160]  It's just clearly meant to be an app and I mean a website, not an app.
[51:42.720 --> 51:46.640]  Whereas Robinhood is app first, is meant to be on the phone.
[51:46.640 --> 51:50.800]  And you know, so I could see why that's appealing to the kids and especially these
[51:50.800 --> 51:55.920]  kids who are betting, right, who aren't just buying and holding, you know, once a
[51:55.920 --> 52:00.240]  month, put some more money into your fund and buy an index fund and build an
[52:00.240 --> 52:01.200]  investment nest.
[52:01.200 --> 52:05.280]  Kids who are sitting there in Reddit all day long buying and selling and dumping
[52:05.280 --> 52:09.920]  and, you know, but the big thing, right, is they don't have fees, right?
[52:11.600 --> 52:13.520]  Well, E-Trade doesn't have fees anymore either.
[52:13.520 --> 52:18.800]  Fees, you know, I think once some of these brokerages went to no fee, everybody
[52:18.800 --> 52:22.800]  kind of had to go to no fee and because the whole, the fees thing turned out to
[52:22.800 --> 52:23.840]  be a racket.
[52:23.840 --> 52:26.880]  You know, it was sort of like ATM fees, right?
[52:26.880 --> 52:31.760]  And it's like, imagine like, but you're a customer of theirs.
[52:31.760 --> 52:36.480]  And so like, even if you still pay ATM fees when you go like out of your bank's
[52:36.480 --> 52:41.600]  network, it would be crazy if your own bank charged you an ATM fees.
[52:41.600 --> 52:41.920]  Right.
[52:41.920 --> 52:42.320]  Yeah.
[52:42.320 --> 52:45.680]  That's, I think, I don't know, maybe other people have fees, but E-Trade doesn't
[52:45.680 --> 52:47.040]  charge fees anymore either.
[52:47.040 --> 52:50.800]  Okay, I don't know, yeah, but I don't know E-Trade's business model, but
[52:50.800 --> 52:54.880]  Robinhood is basically making money off of selling all the information.
[52:54.880 --> 52:56.080]  Right, right.
[52:56.080 --> 53:00.720]  So the, you know, their customers for money is that they allow, you know, they
[53:00.720 --> 53:05.520]  have hedge funds that they allow to get access to the fire hose of the trade
[53:05.520 --> 53:06.160]  information.
[53:06.800 --> 53:08.960]  And what's it called?
[53:08.960 --> 53:10.080]  High frequency trading.
[53:11.520 --> 53:15.680]  Where, and it's sort of like trying to think about how computers work these
[53:15.680 --> 53:20.640]  days and, you know, how many computations per se, like when Apple tells you
[53:20.640 --> 53:25.280]  that when you take a photo with your iPhone and it does three trillion
[53:25.280 --> 53:30.160]  operations in the instant, you hit the shutter and it's like, how is that even
[53:30.160 --> 53:31.040]  three trillion?
[53:31.040 --> 53:31.600]  What?
[53:31.600 --> 53:33.280]  It's like, how is that even possible?
[53:33.280 --> 53:37.840]  Like, and it's like hard to wrap your mind around it, but it's like these high
[53:37.840 --> 53:39.920]  frequency trade things.
[53:39.920 --> 53:43.120]  It's like when they have access to the fire hose, basically, I think this is a
[53:43.120 --> 53:44.240]  fair description.
[53:44.240 --> 53:52.240]  And it's like just John Molt's joke consumer decides to buy 10 shares of
[53:52.240 --> 53:56.080]  GameStop at $300 even.
[53:56.720 --> 54:09.760]  And the fire hose could see that somebody else is selling ones at $299.75.
[54:09.760 --> 54:15.280]  And so they can quick buy those shares at $299.75 and then sell those to you
[54:15.280 --> 54:18.400]  for $300 and make, you know, a couple of pennies.
[54:18.400 --> 54:20.160]  And it's probably even smaller.
[54:20.160 --> 54:20.960]  I'm saying a quarter.
[54:20.960 --> 54:26.720]  Maybe it's like a penny, like, you know, but if you do this at the thousands of
[54:26.720 --> 54:32.480]  times per second scale, you can make a large sum of money with the arbitrage of
[54:32.480 --> 54:34.080]  just the change bank, right?
[54:34.080 --> 54:34.480]  It is.
[54:34.480 --> 54:35.520]  It's the change bank.
[54:36.240 --> 54:37.120]  I made that joke.
[54:37.120 --> 54:43.920]  I saw Kevin Nealon on Twitter say that that still is one of his all-time
[54:43.920 --> 54:45.280]  favorite SNL skits.
[54:45.280 --> 54:46.640]  It's great.
[54:48.800 --> 54:54.960]  But it's like, yeah, it's like the change bank come to life and somehow, you know,
[54:54.960 --> 55:04.480]  if two $10 bills are sometimes worth $20 and a penny that, you know, it doesn't
[55:04.480 --> 55:08.000]  make sense with cash, but if that's, you know, in stocks, it's like all of a
[55:08.000 --> 55:12.640]  sudden two $10 bills are temporarily worth $20 and one cent.
[55:12.640 --> 55:16.880]  You quick buy those and turn them into a $20 bill and you pocket the penny.
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.400]  You know, anyway, that's how these guys make money.
[55:20.400 --> 55:23.120]  But it still isn't clear.
[55:23.120 --> 55:26.480]  It's like, so anyway, this whole thing with Robinhood, you know, and the basic
[55:26.480 --> 55:30.720]  idea is, you know, you put money in your account and then with your money you can
[55:30.720 --> 55:34.880]  buy stocks and, you know, these options and the other stuff, but they all have
[55:34.880 --> 55:39.840]  prices and you can buy as many as you are allowed to buy and you buy them and sell
[55:39.840 --> 55:40.960]  them and you do things.
[55:40.960 --> 55:47.520]  And all of a sudden, Robinhood said to these people who are, and that this is
[55:47.520 --> 55:50.320]  where it really gets interesting because it's not like, like, so for example,
[55:50.320 --> 55:55.680]  E-Trade, the one I use, apparently stopped allowing people to buy GameStop at
[55:55.680 --> 56:00.160]  like 3.30 in the afternoon, like a half hour before trading closed on Thursday.
[56:00.160 --> 56:04.000]  Nobody, you don't see any articles about it because people weren't really using
[56:04.000 --> 56:04.960]  E-Trade for this.
[56:04.960 --> 56:06.720]  And it was only for half an hour.
[56:06.720 --> 56:10.400]  And it was just sort of, you know, it actually seems much more reasonable.
[56:10.400 --> 56:12.560]  It was just sort of like, we don't even know what's going on.
[56:12.560 --> 56:13.440]  Just give us a break.
[56:13.440 --> 56:14.800]  Give us a chance to catch our breath.
[56:15.360 --> 56:18.160]  Whereas Robinhood just said, you can't buy it anymore.
[56:19.120 --> 56:19.360]  Yeah.
[56:20.000 --> 56:23.520]  And then they didn't, they, I mean, they had some sort of fiduciary problem with
[56:23.520 --> 56:23.840]  it, right?
[56:23.840 --> 56:26.960]  Because they couldn't, there was so much trading going on that it couldn't cover
[56:26.960 --> 56:29.120]  the amounts.
[56:29.120 --> 56:30.400]  Something like that.
[56:30.400 --> 56:32.240]  I mean, it's still unclear.
[56:32.240 --> 56:37.120]  And, and, and, and it gets, you know, it gets to the SCC rules about, you have to
[56:37.120 --> 56:41.680]  have a certain amount of money in order to be able to execute these trades.
[56:41.680 --> 56:44.720]  You can't just like, I, as a, as an individual, I can't walk in there and say,
[56:44.720 --> 56:47.520]  I want to, I want to trade a million shares of Apple.
[56:47.520 --> 56:49.040]  It's like, no, you can't do that.
[56:49.040 --> 56:52.320]  You don't, you, like, if it goes sour, you'll go bankrupt.
[56:52.320 --> 56:55.120]  And then, you know, the whole thing will fall apart.
[56:55.120 --> 56:59.440]  So you have to have a certain amount of money in the bank in order to be able to
[56:59.440 --> 57:01.920]  do certain kinds of large trades.
[57:01.920 --> 57:05.360]  And they didn't have enough money because there was so much going on.
[57:05.920 --> 57:10.560]  One of the weird things about Robinhood that I didn't realize, and, and it, the,
[57:10.560 --> 57:15.280]  even before last week, but the, one of the knocks against Robinhood was that they
[57:15.280 --> 57:21.280]  promote this gambling mentality and they know, and everybody knows their, you
[57:21.280 --> 57:25.440]  know, their target audience is younger and that this isn't a good idea.
[57:25.440 --> 57:29.920]  You know, that it's perhaps dangerous and sort of promoting the idea that you
[57:29.920 --> 57:30.560]  can't lose.
[57:30.560 --> 57:33.120]  Whereas, you know, you definitely can lose.
[57:33.120 --> 57:37.680]  But one of the weird things about it is that the default account for, if you just
[57:37.680 --> 57:43.200]  go through the default of setting up a new Robinhood account, your default is a
[57:43.200 --> 57:45.920]  margin account, not a cash account.
[57:45.920 --> 57:47.760]  Whereas a cash account is okay.
[57:47.760 --> 57:52.960]  Like E-Trade, you go there, sign up, you wire E-Trade a thousand dollars.
[57:53.760 --> 57:57.280]  And then when that clears, you know, I guess maybe if it's a wire transfer, it
[57:57.280 --> 57:58.320]  could clear up instantly.
[57:58.320 --> 58:01.120]  If you do like a regular bank transfer, maybe it takes two days.
[58:01.680 --> 58:04.800]  Then you have a thousand dollars in your E-Trade account and you can buy a
[58:04.800 --> 58:08.960]  thousand dollars worth of, uh, stock stock.
[58:08.960 --> 58:11.200]  Whereas a margin account is like buying on credit.
[58:11.840 --> 58:12.480]  Do you understand?
[58:12.480 --> 58:15.040]  I'm not quite sure I understand how that works, but I don't know.
[58:15.040 --> 58:16.880]  I don't understand it any better than that.
[58:16.880 --> 58:18.160]  Right.
[58:18.160 --> 58:21.680]  But it's, you know, I understand how casinos work much better.
[58:21.680 --> 58:26.320]  You know, casinos, you, you, you, you can play, but you can step up to a blackjack
[58:26.320 --> 58:30.560]  table and put a thousand dollars in cash down and say, I would like a thousand
[58:30.560 --> 58:31.280]  dollars in chips.
[58:31.280 --> 58:33.920]  And then they'll count out the money for the camera and then they'll give you a
[58:33.920 --> 58:35.200]  thousand dollars in chips.
[58:35.200 --> 58:37.920]  And then you can play, but you can also get a marker.
[58:38.560 --> 58:41.760]  Now you have to, first thing you have to do is you have, you can't just walk up to
[58:41.760 --> 58:45.680]  in a new casino and say, give me, give me a marker for a thousand dollars.
[58:45.680 --> 58:48.080]  You, you go, there's a, there's a place in the casino.
[58:48.720 --> 58:53.280]  Like it'll usually labeled casino credit and you go over there and wait and you,
[58:53.280 --> 58:56.800]  you give them your driver's license and give them some information and fill out a
[58:56.800 --> 58:57.200]  form.
[58:57.920 --> 59:02.080]  And, um, I don't even know how long it usually takes, but you could do it online
[59:02.080 --> 59:02.320]  now.
[59:02.320 --> 59:05.520]  Like if you know, you're traveling to, uh, uh, Las Vegas or something, you could
[59:05.520 --> 59:06.560]  fill it out in advance.
[59:07.120 --> 59:10.640]  And then they'll, they'll, you could say, I would, I would like, uh, I would like
[59:10.640 --> 59:13.680]  to be cleared for like $10,000 in credit at your casino.
[59:13.680 --> 59:17.840]  Yeah. And then they do some kind of check and then they'll say yes or no.
[59:17.840 --> 59:22.240]  And then when you go there, you can, you can use your like casino player's card
[59:22.240 --> 59:24.320]  or your, just your driver's license.
[59:24.320 --> 59:25.280]  Come up to the table.
[59:25.280 --> 59:28.720]  Once you, you have credit at a casino and you could say, give me a thousand
[59:28.720 --> 59:29.360]  dollar marker.
[59:30.080 --> 59:33.600]  And then a pit boss will walk away and a minute or two later come over.
[59:33.600 --> 59:37.840]  It looks like a check, you know, it's in, you sign your name and it says you, you
[59:37.840 --> 59:41.600]  owe this casino a thousand dollars and you haven't given them a dollar of real
[59:41.600 --> 59:45.360]  money and they'll give you a thousand dollars in chips, but you, you do owe
[59:45.360 --> 59:46.880]  them a thousand dollars.
[59:46.880 --> 59:54.800]  Like margin, you know, a margin account is sort of like that.
[59:54.800 --> 59:58.080]  You can buy stuff that you don't have cash for effectively.
[59:58.720 --> 01:00:02.960]  But the, the thing about when, when that you have to, so that, Hey, I think that
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:07.680]  is a very strange default and seems like it could get people into trouble.
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:13.440]  Like, cause for example, the default at a real casino is cash, right?
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:19.360]  You, you put real money into a real slot machine or you, you put real, real
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:24.320]  greenbacks down on the table to play a table game and then you lose, you can
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.880]  only lose whatever you, whatever you put in.
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:27.040]  Yeah.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:30.560]  You've already handed them the money, you know, you've already put money on the
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:36.080]  table and they, they take it away and put it down the chute and give you these
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:40.880]  fun little chips that are a lot more, they're a lot more fun to lose and win
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.720]  than, than cash.
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:45.680]  But you've already given them the cash and that's the most you can lose.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:49.280]  Whereas when you're playing with markers, you, you know, you could get into real
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.480]  trouble, you know, like, uh, you know, I guess when you play at a legitimate
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:56.880]  casino, it's not quite like a episode of the Sopranos, but they're going to get
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:02.480]  their money, you know, uh, defaulting to a margin account is weird.
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:05.600]  But the thing you have to understand with the Robinhood is they were, they
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:09.040]  blocked everybody from buying GameStop, even if you had a cash account.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:13.600]  So if you gave them a thousand dollars in cash and they had it and it's in your
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:17.200]  account, you could not use that account to buy GameStop.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:22.400]  Like, and, and it is, I, it seems to be some kind of liquidity crisis with, with
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:28.560]  Robinhood where it's not the relationship between you, the user and, and
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:34.320]  Robinhood, it's that Robinhood as, as an, as an institution, didn't have the
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:40.160]  funds to, to cover these trades behind the scenes because they don't
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.280]  actually buy the stocks. They go to a middle person and I guess it takes like
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:47.840]  two days for these things to clear. And people were looking at it and they're
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:52.240]  like, you don't, you know, you, you can't do this.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:56.720]  And that, that's a bad look for a brokerage.
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:03.680]  Well, I, I don't know. I mean, I guess it's, it's bad. Yeah, it's bad to
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:10.320]  the, I mean, it's bad to the, the front end user. It seems bad, but
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:14.640]  you, you've got to, if you want to play in that
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:21.360]  casino, you have to make nice with the, you know, the casino owner. You can't like,
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:24.400]  you can't just walk around doing things willy-nilly. I mean, there are certain
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:30.080]  rules involved and, and, you know, and, and I mean, it's a, it's a government thing
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.480]  as well. It's not just, you know, it's not just
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:36.080]  like trying to make a good for Fidelity or whoever they're doing the
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:40.720]  trade through. It's, it's, you know, it's a
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:45.440]  government requirement and, and I mean, I think there are a few enough
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:49.040]  requirements placed on this stuff as it is. It's nice to see somebody actually,
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:52.960]  you know, they'll see one that's, you know, at least maybe working.
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:58.000]  Well, the, then the, now Robinhood's open to suspicions of
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.920]  chicanery though, because this idea that, hey, they're, they're in bed with these
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:05.360]  hedge funds who, who have shorted the stock and
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.760]  therefore in the hedge funds interest and
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:10.080]  they're the ones who actually pay Robinhood for this
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:15.440]  access, uh, to the, to the high frequency trading information.
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:18.640]  They, it's in their interest for GameStop's
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:23.120]  stock. There, there I go trying to call it GameStop. GameStop stock to go
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:27.920]  down and the way to keep it from going down is to have people buying it
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:31.760]  and the people who are most interested in buying it are blocked out
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:36.560]  and that, yeah, it, it looks bad and I don't know if that's really what was
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:40.400]  going on. Nobody seems to really know, but it certainly,
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.600]  it passes the sniff test of being credible,
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:47.680]  right? It is a very, you know, again, it's like the basic story against GameStop,
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:52.080]  you know, COVID equals retail bad, people buying digital downloads,
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:56.560]  means disks are bad, GameStop's in trouble. Here, the basic story is hedge
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:59.680]  funds, certain hedge funds want GameStop to go
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.800]  down, uh, the way to keep it from going down is
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:07.440]  to have people, uh, like us buy it and we can't buy it
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:10.720]  and Robinhood's in the middle of this. Right,
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:15.040]  yeah, I mean the whole thing is definitely a, you know, it's a big test of
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:18.000]  whether or not the rules of the casino apply to everybody or if there are
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.360]  different sets of rules for one group of people
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:24.720]  and another set of rules for other people. Right, and that's what it looks
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.680]  like, you know, it really does, you know, it's like the hedge funds aren't cut
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:32.160]  off from shorting it even further, um,
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:36.880]  it's just a fascinating story. And so far the bailouts that have happened have
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:40.640]  come from other people in the industry, right, so I think,
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:44.800]  uh, I forget the name of the one that was, um, heavily leveraged on this,
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.840]  um, and like lost like a third of their value or something like that.
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:51.760]  They got killed, it's like Melvin or something like that. Yeah, it started with
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.920]  an M, right, I couldn't remember the name of it, but, um,
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:57.600]  somebody's, another company stepped in and, and like bailed them out.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:01.040]  And the thing that I was afraid of happening was, and you,
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:07.840]  and you heard some of these jerks on, and like the, the financial networks, you
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:10.560]  know, getting on, getting on the air and calling for like
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.720]  government bailouts of these companies, it's like,
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:19.920]  no, no, absolutely not. No, there, it is, and, and, you know, it
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:24.960]  does get to the heart of the, the, the broader outrage is the sense that
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:29.200]  if you're in the suit and tie wearing industry and you have
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:33.520]  a job and you regularly appear on CNBC and you're,
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.040]  they call you an analyst and you work at a firm or whatever,
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:43.920]  there, there's, it, it's a tails, tails I, I win, heads you lose, you know,
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.960]  that, that's the, the way I think Paul Krugman has put it.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:50.720]  Where the idea is if, if the stuff you've bought goes up,
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:54.080]  you, you win because it went up. And if it goes down,
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:57.920]  the public loses because the government comes in and bails them out and makes,
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:02.080]  makes you right. Right. I mean, basically there's a lot, a lot more people should
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:08.400]  have lost everything in the 2008, um, financial crisis. It, it really
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:12.560]  should be considered criminal. It's, it, the, it's criminal that it wasn't criminal.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:16.160]  Right. Right. But there are an awful lot of people who got bailed out
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:20.960]  and, and whereas the, the whole game was, no, you're gambling, you should be able to
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:24.640]  lose, you know. Yeah. And the public shouldn't be the one
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:30.800]  to, to fund making it right. It seems so obvious. It does, but, but they
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:33.920]  justify it. There's, and it's almost like you could see that they believe it
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:38.480]  somehow, right? It's, yeah, yeah, I mean, it's, this is,
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:43.920]  yeah, it's, uh, yeah, I could go on for a while about this.
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:47.360]  All right. Let me, let me take it away. I mean, I just want one, I'll
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:51.360]  do one story real quick, but I was talking to a CEO years ago about like,
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:54.320]  you know, he was incensed about the fact that he had to
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:57.600]  sign these things that, you know, for the government that said, this is, this is,
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.880]  this is, you know, amounts that we made, these are our tax returns. This is
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.440]  verifiable. And he was like, I don't know how, I don't know if this is true.
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.680]  Somebody might, you know, somebody in our accounting firm came up with this. I
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:08.080]  don't, I can't, and yet I have to sign these and take
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:11.280]  personal responsibility. I was like, well, maybe that's why they pay me, pay you so
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:14.160]  much. I mean, like, you can't just, like, you
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:17.840]  can't say, like, you know, I, I make, I make a lot of money because I take all
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:22.800]  these big risks and then just try and mitigate the risks away completely.
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:29.680]  Anyway, who am I to know if these numbers are accurate? I'm just the CEO.
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:35.600]  Like, as though you just asked, like, the, the night custodian, you know, like,
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:39.040]  you're right. I just, I just walked in here. I don't know what's going on.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:43.760]  Yeah, well, put your name on this. You're on the, you're on the hook with the SEC.
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:46.880]  Sorry, Rodney Dangerfield. You're the CEO.
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:51.440]  And if the numbers don't add up, they just come in and whisk.
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:54.720]  Right, right. Well, we'll make it good. We'll just, you know, the government will
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:57.440]  come in and the entire country will pay, pay for any
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:01.360]  mistakes you make. All right, let me take a break and thank
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:04.720]  our next sponsor. Oh, man, what a great, it's a podcast,

[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:32.800]  right up my alley that is going on that may not be the biggest news of the day,
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:36.880]  but it is news. It'll be there on the tech meme home page. I love it. But

[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:13.280]  truly recommend it.
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:18.800]  What else we got on the agenda here? Apple's quarterly results.
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:22.560]  I guess we might as well follow on the our put on keep our
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:27.920]  shirts and ties on. I never know what to do. This is one of
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:31.840]  those things where it's like, I always mention the quarterly
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.920]  results but I never know how much right because it's not
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:38.400]  that's not really what I'm interested in. I mean if something truly profound
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.960]  happened you know and you know you want to know you know
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:45.040]  like you know if you're really in trouble it
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.680]  it it'd be more of interest to me if they were
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:49.600]  troubled than when they have a good quarter
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:53.520]  and they just had I think a great quarter.
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:11:01.120]  Yeah for yeah I mean for a first fiscal quarter it was amazing.
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:05.120]  And I guess you know the thing I take away from as somebody who's
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:08.480]  almost solely interested in Apple for the products and
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:12.640]  services I guess now that they make and not as an investor. I do not
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:16.720]  own Apple stock for the reason that I think it would you know be a
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:19.920]  conflict of interest. I just don't want the hassle.
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.960]  So I'm not interested and I know you know Daring Fireball is not an Apple
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:26.880]  investors site but it is interesting to me how the
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:29.200]  results interact with how I feel about how
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:32.640]  their products are going and I feel like everything is in pretty good shape and
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:36.000]  the results reflect it. It was a great quarter for the iPhone, a
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.640]  great quarter for the Mac, pretty good for iPad
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:45.360]  and the services are on a slow steady consistent march upward.
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:50.240]  Yeah yeah and for years the whole the whole thing was like oh Apple is too
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:56.640]  dependent on iPhone revenue right and now the services revenue and the
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:59.920]  wearables revenue has really grown to the point where
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:02.640]  it I mean you can't really say that's much of a concern anymore.
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:06.240]  I saw a tweet this morning I think it was a tweet
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:12.640]  it was on Philip Elmer DeWitt's PED30 site from Horace Dedue but
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:18.640]  as Horace graphed it, if you subtract the iPhone from
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:23.040]  Apple's quarter the rest of the company is now at
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:28.560]  the size that all of Apple was at in either 2012 or 2013 or something like
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.480]  that. Yeah I thought it was yeah I think I saw
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:35.920]  there was I thought it was 2012. Yeah so and 2012 was sort of
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:40.480]  at the height of hey this iPhone thing is clearly fantastic
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:43.600]  but you know it they're too dependent on it
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:47.440]  you know right right it's like there's always it's like
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:51.200]  that Apple stock for some reason has always attracted these Debbie Downers
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:56.320]  you know like oh so they've got the most the most
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:01.920]  profitable product in the history of consumer goods
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:05.520]  too dependent on it can't last yeah yeah right right that's the that's a way of
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:10.080]  like finding I mean in the whole the the idea is
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:13.120]  so ludicrous on the face of it I mean the idea what's the
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:17.440]  what is the concern is the concern that the iPhone is simply just going to go
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:21.680]  away I mean I guess not like it's not like
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:25.200]  you're gonna wake up tomorrow and there's not going to be an iPhone
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:30.720]  right and and it's hard to yeah it's as opposed to and you know it's it's a
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:34.160]  great testimony to the idea of cannibalizing your own product I
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:37.920]  mentioned the iPod earlier in the show and nobody buys I they don't even sell
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:40.320]  iPods anymore I guess they have the iPod touch
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:44.400]  yeah do they have the shuffle still they had the shuffle for a while
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:49.040]  I don't think they do well we'll find out I'm sure we'll find out on Twitter
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:52.080]  after the show airs but I don't think they do I don't I do not
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:55.680]  think they still sell the shuffle
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:01.600]  but the iPod was a very big hit and it was very successful
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:07.520]  and they made the iPhone such that the one of the first three things
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:12.960]  that Steve Jobs said it did was it it was a great what wide screen video
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:17.600]  playing iPod um yeah and nobody
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:20.640]  you know and I guess if you go young enough now like
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:24.880]  if like I tried to like our sons if we tried to convince our sons that they
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:28.640]  should buy a 400 device to put in their pocket that
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:31.360]  plays music
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.960]  and does the hard drive a physical hard drive
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:40.960]  and doesn't stream music you gotta you gotta load this all the songs onto the
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:44.640]  device you gotta have them on there they would
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:47.680]  you know look at us like we're nuts because why would you do that when you
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:49.840]  already have a device in your pocket that plays
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:54.800]  all of your music and can have you know does have a network connection
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:58.400]  and streams which is the only way they know how to play music
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:02.400]  uh looks looks like there's no touch you mean no shuffle
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:07.280]  that shuffle shuffle um you know so they cannibalized it it's
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:12.080]  but it was easy to imagine how hypothetically like if if in 2006 the
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:15.120]  year before the iPhone was announced and and
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:18.400]  maybe we even did I don't know maybe you and I did have a podcast where we
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:21.440]  talked about it but somebody could have easily imagined a
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:26.240]  future where hey I think MP standalone mp3 players are gonna go
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:29.120]  away I think phones you know maybe this
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:33.120]  rocker isn't it but the idea that you you only need one
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:37.040]  electronic device in your pocket and it can play music in addition to make your
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:40.320]  phone calls and send your text messages or whatever we
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:45.040]  thought phones did in 2006 uh you know it can play the snake game
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:50.000]  you only need one device right and that that argument makes sense
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.560]  right and it's credible whereas at this point even now
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:59.280]  uh 15 years or almost you know 14 years into
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:06.640]  the uh iPhone era it's very hard to imagine
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:10.720]  a near term I mean am I gonna do I think everybody's gonna have iPhones in 20
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:14.720]  years I don't know maybe you know I mean the
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:19.120]  Mac has had a life like that but certainly for the next five to ten
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:22.720]  years it's very difficult to imagine a world where people don't have phones
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:29.600]  yeah it's just almost impossible um I mean what I mean I guess in theory
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:33.360]  glasses or something could replace it but even then I suppose
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:36.800]  I don't see it replacing the phone though I it's like even these glasses I
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:40.560]  think would be like the watch where the you know yeah they're tethered to
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:43.440]  your phone you're you've got your little pocket computer and then
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:47.520]  and it wirelessly communicates to these other devices that you wear
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:52.480]  uh yeah uh so anyway good quarter for the iPhone
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:56.000]  iPhone 12 seems to be a hit good quarter for the Mac
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.840]  uh iPad I don't know what else to say you know
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:03.200]  good good quarter yeah and I think there used to be I mean when
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:07.920]  they released um unit sales there was a little bit more to talk
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:10.720]  about right based on comparisons to previous
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:13.440]  quarters and stuff like that and they don't do that anymore so
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:17.200]  yeah and you know I don't blame them it would be I guess it was more fun when
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:20.480]  they did but yeah but nobody else did no and you
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:24.160]  know and you could see how that was highly competitive information you know
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:27.600]  yeah right and and you know and people would
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:31.440]  nitpick it right I mean they would oh you know
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:34.880]  stayed flat or it didn't go up as much as we thought or I mean
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:37.760]  just forget it
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:44.240]  they can and and I don't think they massage the numbers but they they have
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:48.800]  they've gone to great lengths to smooth out their revenue streams right because
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:50.960]  they moved everybody they're trying to move
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:56.400]  everybody to subscriptions for and and paying in um
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:00.240]  you know the purchase plans and things like that so that they're not
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:04.080]  getting the money in one quarter and then having to like
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:08.160]  deal with the fact that their their money is not
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:11.120]  that their income is like uneven right like the the
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:14.640]  the overall spike for the holiday quarter is no longer it doesn't seem to
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:18.800]  be as disproportionate as it used to be and and everybody understands
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:23.040]  that it's the basic nature that Apple makes
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:29.840]  devices that are natural holiday gifts is you know how even if you're stupid
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:34.000]  you you could see that right I mean
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:37.840]  I thought it was interesting I wrote about it on Daring Farba I thought it
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:40.960]  was interesting that the max sales actually went down a little bit from
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:45.280]  the previous quarter which seems to be a little bit of column
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:49.680]  a which is that the the july september quarter is back to
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:53.040]  school and which is always a good quarter for
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:58.240]  the mac and then a little bit of column b which is that max were supply
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:04.480]  constrained probably for covid related supply chain reasons and maybe because
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:07.920]  apple silicon's new in I would think it's yeah
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:11.120]  got to be that right just you know but there you know and a couple people are
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:13.840]  like yeah I tried to buy you know there are certain configurations
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:17.200]  of the the the new apple silicon max that
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:20.480]  that are like 30 days out you know yeah you could because I
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:26.400]  ordered mine the day after christmas um and I just got it the other day yeah
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:30.320]  well there you go that's yeah literally 30 days right right
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:33.840]  right um yeah and I configured it and I think
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:39.200]  you could get the non-configured ones um relatively well I don't know about how
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.440]  quick but you could get them faster for sure
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:45.440]  yeah so that makes sense um I think that the back to school thing
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:50.960]  is really uh it's sort of like the holiday quarter was a little bit
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:53.760]  good for the mac because these apple silicon machines every
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:59.520]  a lot of people were waiting for them uh and they were universally well regarded
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:02.160]  we'll get to talking about yours by the end of the show
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:05.600]  but I think that the back to school factor in this
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:12.000]  covid year was a bigger factor than even apple silicon was to pump
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:17.680]  up that back to school quarter because yeah it's like kids of all ages
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:21.360]  globally right it's not just a us thing it's not just
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:25.600]  a high school a college thing it's like middle school kids any kids who might
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:29.280]  need a computer at home you know and if if you know just how
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:33.120]  many you know and the fact that people adults were working at home I mean I
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:37.760]  know this firsthand from our immediate greater family that
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:41.840]  you know most families aren't like the Gruber household where we have more
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:44.960]  more macs than people
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:48.720]  at any given time that's that's a highly unusual ratio
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:52.720]  there's an awful lot of families that in normal times when there's not a pandemic
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:56.640]  that's locking everybody at home have shared computers shared for
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:59.440]  multiple kids shared between adults and kids
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:04.160]  you know and a long-standing complaint about ipads is that they do not support
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:08.800]  multi-user in the way that macs do where you can each you know different
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:12.160]  family members just there's a nice friendly menu up in the menu bar
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:16.000]  and you just switch it down to your name and
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:20.640]  right now you're in your account and uh that doesn't work when you've got two
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:25.760]  kids in school at the same time and up to two adults who might be working
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:29.200]  at at the same time and all need computers it's you know people
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:33.040]  people bought an awful lot you can see it in tim kook's remarks there's almost
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:38.320]  like an apology for how well and i he does seem to be a i know he has
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:42.240]  a taste for profits and he is you know he's the capitalist ceo of the most
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:46.160]  profitable company in the world but you can almost see it in his remarks
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:49.200]  it's like this this you know this is terrible that we're
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:52.160]  making all this money
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:57.120]  i feel i feel just awful about this yeah well i i honestly think that he
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:01.280]  if he could wish away if he had a one wish and could and and could be used
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:04.800]  to make it so that covid didn't happen knowing that it would mean that apple
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:07.840]  would have had a you know less somewhat less successful
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:11.680]  year i don't think he would hesitate to do it i i feel like he feels bad about
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:15.600]  that trade-off whereas some people might be like wow this covid is the best
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:19.600]  thing that ever happened for me yeah right um but i think the mac in
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:23.520]  particular really really benefited from that in in q3
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:28.720]  yeah uh anything else from the apple quarterly results i didn't really
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:32.800]  i i i guess there's some question i don't want to go too far into it with
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:35.440]  the apple report card but the one product
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:39.360]  that is so weird of all of them is the apple tv
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:44.400]  right like snell released his apple report card yesterday and it's like
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:49.520]  everybody has the same marks it's like and and it's bizarre like my quip
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:52.800]  on it for the report card is just it is just it's
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:56.800]  it's not necessarily bizarre that apple isn't interested in selling set top tv
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:00.480]  boxes like their their living room
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:03.520]  hardware interest has always clearly been a hobby
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:06.720]  right it goes i think literally goes back to the steve jobs era of calling
[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:10.240]  it a hobby but their overall interest in living
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:13.680]  room now is very high because they are all in
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:17.920]  on apple tv plus as a service uh the city of
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:20.880]  philadelphia all the billboard space here in center
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:25.200]  city philadelphia is all uh servant it's the the m night
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:28.400]  shamalan uh show that actually takes place here in
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:30.800]  philadelphia but i don't think that's why but
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:33.840]  probably nationwide but they've been advertising
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:37.760]  shows they had ted lasso advertisements you know they're
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:41.520]  uh you know they're all in on this service but their
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:45.040]  their hardware interest seems like oh yeah we do we
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:49.840]  oh yeah we still sell a box yeah huh how do you like the remote
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:52.160]  occasionally they occasionally sell a box
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:56.080]  they haven't up i mean that one's been out for a few years now right and
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:58.560]  there's been a rumor of a new one coming soon but it
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:02.160]  i think it seemed like it was going to come this past year but
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:07.520]  right didn't and now it's been kicked to this year supposedly right and it
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:11.840]  i mean i have so i have a tv in my office which is a bad idea but
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:18.480]  um and i have not the not the apple tv 4k but the apple tv 4 yeah
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:22.720]  attached to it and i have apple arcade and i was going to go play oh you know
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:26.640]  because i i figure out you know what i do i can i
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:32.080]  can justify it by doing it in my own place of apple arcade games and i
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:35.840]  went to play one of the one of the games and it didn't
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:38.640]  play on that one so it's it's not the most recent
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:41.520]  generation but it was the previous generation and it doesn't even
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:45.120]  you know one of the apple arcade games doesn't even play on that unit and then
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:48.640]  another game supposedly played but played like crap
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:52.080]  and it's just it that seems weird to me like the the
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:55.600]  previous you have to have the most updated one but i don't want to get
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:58.480]  like i don't want to go get another one right i'm not going to go buy another
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:02.160]  one right now because it seems like they should have released one already by
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:04.480]  now and they haven't it's like with
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:08.320]  everything in technology there's always a sense that if you don't buy it
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:12.720]  as soon as it comes out you're always at the edge of well maybe i should wait
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:15.920]  for the next one right i mean that's always true
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:20.080]  and and it is one of the nice things about the very regular schedule of
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:25.040]  iphones right that you just kind of know apple now the apple comes out with the
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:30.240]  regular iphones in september october and it's annual
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:35.040]  and if you know there aren't many people who are waiting for se's
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:39.440]  that we have a present though so yeah present company excluded i know
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:43.680]  president i don't want to you know present but you know and you're you're
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:46.640]  savvy enough where you could you probably were you know
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:49.760]  follow the rumors and you kind of knew when to get one and
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:53.680]  but it's you know the whole point of the se is that it sells mostly to people who
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:56.800]  aren't like knowledgeable about whether this phone
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:00.240]  is six months old or whatever it's like how much does it cost
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:04.800]  and does you know okay i'll take that one um
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:10.800]  the the apple tv 4k though is is so far at the extreme of that because
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:16.400]  it's so expensive compared to other competing plug this into the hdmi port
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:19.040]  on your on your tv and you can stream stuff
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:22.720]  right it's there's a whole bunch of boxes a whole bunch of choices
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:25.920]  and apple tv 4k is at the extreme end of the cost
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:29.440]  spectrum on that it's still it's like 160 bucks or something like that
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:32.560]  yeah it's crazy it's ridiculous i mean for a company that
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:35.280]  wants you to get in i mean that basically is selling it for the
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:39.360]  services aspect right and if i didn't even realize that
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:42.400]  some of the arcade games don't even play well on the old one but it doesn't
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:45.040]  surprise me because the old one is so many years older
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:50.640]  that it really does i'm sure have a terrible gpu by apple standards today
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:55.120]  uh it doesn't make any sense who wants to spend 180 on a box that's already
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:57.120]  way more expensive than all the other boxes
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:01.520]  knowing that surely apple has to be coming out with a new one soon
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:06.160]  i don't know yeah and and i think most people don't even
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:09.520]  care about the arcade aspect of it for the i mean
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:14.560]  people who are i would imagine that most people who are into arcade are playing
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:18.960]  on their phone or an ipad or something well i i think that's i i feel like i'm
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:20.960]  probably one of the few people who actually plays
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:25.200]  some things on the apple tv it and again it's all very obvious
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:29.280]  and i know i've talked about it before but it really does make sense it
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:32.480]  the 4k clearly is powerful enough to play
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:36.640]  pretty good games you know it's it i i almost
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:40.800]  i'm willing to bet on the fact that it's a more powerful gpu than the nintendo
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:43.840]  switch has and people play the switch on their tv
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:47.520]  you know a million times a day uh but you know
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:50.880]  it's the most obvious thing in the world i bet most people don't even realize
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:54.160]  apple tv can play games because it doesn't look like it plays games
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:58.320]  because it ships with a remote control that crappy remote that
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:01.840]  doesn't isn't even good for playing video yeah
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:06.240]  yeah like if you thought that remote was bad for
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:09.680]  streaming you know playback a video wait until you try to
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:13.360]  drive a cart game with it you know it's yeah
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:16.800]  you know and then they're they're caught in the middle they're the device
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:19.280]  is caught in the middle because it wants to be two different
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:21.840]  things it wants to be like a like a tv stick
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.120]  and it also wants to be a game console right and
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:28.480]  it's not good at either i don't know what the answer is
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:33.120]  i i hope they think and figure it out but yeah i i kind of hope
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:38.000]  that the idea that the company is so interested in services and that apple
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.760]  arcade is a service that they uh see as you know
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:44.640]  they don't have many of them like in the apple one bundle you know
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:49.920]  and if they treat them all as being important that they're going to
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:52.640]  come up with some i don't know would they actually put an apple game
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:58.240]  controller in the box i don't know but some kind of i would
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:04.240]  yeah i don't know so if they want to keep it as 160
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:08.880]  this 150 200 device i don't think it's unreasonable to think that they would
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:14.960]  put a good remote control and a good controller in there yeah
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:18.080]  and assume that they can make money on the service
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:20.880]  right that that's sort of the thing is that okay we're not going to make a lot
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:24.400]  of money on this but we'll get people to sign up for
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:28.560]  apple one and they can watch apple tv and then they can play apple arcade
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:33.520]  and they could still buy you know the new releases on the itunes movie store
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:37.680]  and you know that's it's not you know selling stuff
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:41.120]  for break even and making it up on the margin isn't really apple's business
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:43.760]  they like to sell stuff for a profit and do it but
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:47.440]  in the in this market in particular i don't see any way around it you know
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:51.120]  yeah or they unless unless you see you know you split it right you you can
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:54.480]  you could sell a stick and you could sell right the thing that's supposed to
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:57.120]  be a game you know a game platform right but they
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:00.960]  you know they have third-party controller support in apple tv but i
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:03.680]  feel like if it doesn't come with it people just don't
[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:07.040]  people don't want to do it agree like nobody you know i'm glad i'm glad i got
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:10.160]  a steel series i'm glad i got it it's a really nice controller
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:15.760]  and it works very well with it but the fact that it doesn't come in the
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:20.160]  box i think is a big deal yeah and and without it it's like the
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:24.000]  games just aren't good you know i mean there's only so many games where the you
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.920]  know what do they call the endless runners
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:28.000]  where there's like a one button right and you run
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.200]  there some of those games are fun but they really do make a lot more sense to
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:34.480]  me on the phone right than they do when
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:37.360]  you're playing on a tv where you could be playing on any other way to play

[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:45.360]  i so the iphone 12 mini yeah you've been waiting for a small phone
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:48.880]  i've been waiting you know waiting for four years for this phone
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:53.280]  so i had yeah i mean i got the the se i had a 6s
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:56.240]  right i think that was the one yeah so that was the last the last bigger phone
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:33:01.360]  that i had i got a 6s well until i got the other se but this so
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:04.640]  i had the success and then i got the se when that came out because i really just
[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:10.000]  prefer a smaller phone and had that for four years
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.600]  and couldn't and it was really dragging at the end
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:17.360]  a year ago and was i was just kind of dying for the next thing to
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:21.280]  to be released and i knew that there was you know the way the rumors looked that
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:25.840]  they were going to release the you know a 6s sized se or seven sized
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:30.720]  whatever and um then release a smaller phone than
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:32.880]  that in the fall which is exactly what happened but
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:37.280]  i was kind of at the end of my rope with my you know 2016 se so
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:40.640]  when the se the 2020 se came out i bought that
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:43.600]  and it was a good phone i mean it was still bigger than i wanted but it was a
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:47.840]  it was a decent it was a decent phone it wasn't as big as like the 10 sized ones
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:52.160]  and and then of course yeah they came out with the with the 12 mini
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:55.280]  and so i decided i i'd return my my se
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:34:01.360]  too and get the 12 mini and this is the phone that i wanted so
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:05.120]  it's interesting so that means you're you're like late to the game you're only
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:09.760]  really now into the new iphone 10 style
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:16.000]  2.0 era of of interaction with ios right well except i mean i did have an ipad so
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.320]  right um i had an ipad pro that i bought uh the 11 whenever that
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:25.600]  the 11 inch yeah so i've had it for a couple
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:29.520]  couple years right something like that so what do you what do you think overall
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:32.880]  i love it i mean it's what like i said it's it's this i mean it's
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:36.240]  even i would go even a little smaller but um
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:44.320]  it's great and um i like the blue i got the blue and it's
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:47.600]  i just don't like the bigger phones and it doesn't really have much
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:51.840]  i mean like my hands aren't and you know unusually small they're not huge
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:56.400]  but uh i just don't like trying to get to that upper corner
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:59.600]  um the whatever icon happens to be up there
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:05.520]  and i i just would rather have a smaller phone and i don't like a huge
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:09.200]  phone in my pocket either uh if i want if i want to look at
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:12.240]  something on a bigger screen i just grab my ipad i mean because i'm in the house
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:15.360]  most of the time anyway so i think that's part of it right
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:19.520]  because i'm not out and about and i don't need a big screen on the move
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:23.360]  um where i want to carry just one device and be able to read something or look at
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:26.720]  a video or whatever um i'm usually in the
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:28.800]  house if i want to look at a video i'll do it on my
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:34.320]  my laptop or on my ipad um and the the phone is really for just you know when
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:39.360]  i'm moving around and it i would rather have it be smaller so
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:44.480]  uh it you know and the camera obviously the thing the big difference is the
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:48.240]  camera coming from the original se because it's a
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:52.400]  great camera it is a great camera it is the iphone 12 camera with no
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:56.400]  no compromises compared i mean i know the pro models have the extra lens but
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:59.120]  the full you know regular size i guess i
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:04.080]  should say iphone 12 has the exact same camera system as the 12 mini i
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:08.080]  i've said this before it this is the hardest year this is the only year of
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:11.440]  with the iphone where i had a hard time deciding which one i like best and i
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:15.520]  honestly think i might have i ended up deciding i want the regular iphone 12
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:18.640]  not pro because i love the difference in weight
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:24.400]  so much more i i find the 12 pro and forget about the max uh which is
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:26.880]  just too big for me i just don't have a taste for the size
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:30.400]  and and i i understand why some people do i get it
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:34.240]  but i feel bad for people who just want a big one and that there is no
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:40.320]  like just iphone 12 max that's not pro that's made out of the aluminum and the
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:44.560]  lighter weight stuff but you get the big size um like the if
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:48.960]  you really want big your starting price is 1100 which is
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:51.280]  yeah crazy and that was the other that was i mean i
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:55.360]  liked about the i guess there are probably two kinds of people who buy
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:59.120]  the se ever bought the original se i mean people who wanted something that
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:01.680]  was cheap and people who wanted something that was small
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:04.720]  right and i was not you know it was great that it was cheap
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:08.160]  because i could just pay for it with cash i mean i bought that phone outright
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:12.960]  and i did the same thing with the the se last year but um you would still
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:17.280]  like to have that iphone 5 size though like like if they made it if they came
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:20.800]  out with an iphone 13 nano that was well if it didn't yeah i mean if it didn't
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:22.880]  yeah i mean particularly if it didn't have bezels
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:26.640]  right that would probably be enough for me see i think that would be too small
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:31.120]  but i've seen some you know mike davidson uh on twitter
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:34.640]  i a long time friend of mine but he he's a long time
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:40.560]  small very similar taste to you has always liked small phones likes the
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:44.400]  iphone 12 mini but his you know very short tweet length take is that he still
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:48.000]  thinks it could be smaller be smaller yeah i think it could be a little
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.680]  smaller i found it so hard to to decide between
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:56.320]  the 12 and 12 mini like to me i i i like the idea of the
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:59.680]  better camera and the zoom and everything but and i did i went through
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:02.800]  my photo library and did like a smart search for all the photos i took with
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:07.680]  the 2x lens and it's like but just and i used it more often than i
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:12.240]  thought but i don't think that using the 1x lens and cropping to zoom in a
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:14.240]  little more would make that big a difference and
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:18.000]  i'm okay with that and i know that for the next year at
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.320]  least big chunk of the year i'm not going to travel
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:24.400]  so i'm not really not taking as many photos not taking as many photos
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:27.920]  as i usually yeah right but the the weight difference
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:32.800]  for me is just so much i just so i i find the iphone 12 pro to be heavy i
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:36.160]  really i don't know i i know it looks cooler i to some people's
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:40.960]  taste with the steel but it just seems silly to me to have a heavier phone and
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:47.280]  the weird weird totally you know rarefied bizarre status
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:52.160]  where i have all four of them from apple to as review units and don't
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:54.880]  just have to stand there at a table in the store
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:59.040]  with one that's tethered to the desk and decide which i can actually use them for
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:03.360]  days it you know i i i really try to
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:06.960]  give that info because i know most people don't get to do that but
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:11.200]  yeah man the 12 mini i i feel like the difference though for me
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:16.560]  if it hadn't been for covid i might have got the 12 mini instead of the 12
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:20.160]  because i feel like then i would have been out and
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:24.080]  the advantages of having a nice small device in my pocket would be even more
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:28.000]  prominent when i'm at home and it's like i just have it on the on
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.040]  my desk and it's not even in my pocket it's like who cares
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:34.160]  i don't know yeah it was a very close call for me i
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:38.160]  the 12 mini is so nice it is so exactly like
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:41.520]  just one of those items that for a couple of years was
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:45.040]  on the list of boy i hope apple will make a smaller phone
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:48.400]  and if they do i hope they you know don't give it like a year old processor
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:52.080]  and a year old camera and and it's like nope they did it and
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:54.960]  it's great and now we'll see if they ever make
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:40:00.960]  whenever again yeah so there's reports that that they've cut production
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:08.080]  uh but a even if it's true that doesn't mean that it's not selling
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:13.520]  good enough and again i don't have jeff williams is not one of my little birdies
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:16.240]  so it's i don't i don't know if i've ever even
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:19.600]  like said hello to jeff williams a press event
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:25.760]  uh i i don't have anybody in the operations group whispering to me how
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:28.800]  well things are selling you know they just they don't do that
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:32.560]  but i do know some people at apple i do have some little birdies who aren't
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:34.960]  directly involved but are indirectly involved
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:38.720]  you know with the type of people who do fly to china
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:42.320]  in normal times throughout the year to to
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:46.320]  do work in the factories and make sure things are going well and they're
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:51.360]  therefore more reasonably informed about what's actually going on
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:55.600]  with apple hardware in the supply chain and one thing over the years
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:59.120]  that a couple of these people have told me is that whenever these reports come
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:02.960]  out about like sales cuts or stuff like that
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:06.880]  almost inside apple they're like where is this coming this is nonsense
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:10.080]  and it's not even like the opposite it's not even you know they're like it just
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:12.560]  has no bearing on reality and in the other one
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:16.400]  that has even less bearing in reality are when those and it seems like this is
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:19.120]  a a thing that people don't write about as
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:22.400]  much as they used to but those cost of goods analysis
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:26.160]  where oh yeah everybody loves these things where somebody will come out with
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:30.160]  somebody uh analyzed the iphone 12 and the
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:34.240]  takes 15 cents to make an iphone 12
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:40.000]  it's a fifth it's like it's mostly just sand
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:44.400]  and it's like and is very cheap and like those things are like
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:47.760]  i i know tim cook has addressed those and said that there's
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:51.520]  they're they're nonsense but these production cuts aren't
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:56.000]  and and a big reason and i know this is true this is not just my conjecture
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.520]  it is something that people have told me is that
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:07.600]  apple doesn't trust its supply chain partners to keep information
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:11.680]  private because they know how valuable it is and they know that it leaks
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:15.040]  and so it's all a big game of poker you know we're like
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:18.640]  so like i don't want to throw anybody under the bus or i won't name a real
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:22.640]  company but like you know maybe there's a company that you could you could name
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:25.920]  hunday right like i mean hunday talking about
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:29.680]  like all right project titan stuff like hunday's like
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:32.800]  i've got two fives
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:36.480]  yeah what was up with that what i don't know
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:39.920]  i think it's just like they're new i mean like
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:43.200]  this stuff was and maybe they didn't get it
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:46.800]  that they shouldn't be like talking about it but like you know if there's
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:49.600]  some company making screens for the iphone 12
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:52.720]  and they're making the display components like apple
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:56.560]  doesn't say to them we expect you to make 30 million
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:03.760]  of these iphone 12 screens in the january to march quarter
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:06.960]  and and then you know and then they're like just keep it between us like they
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:09.760]  might have to have to give them some kind of number but it's all
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:13.200]  you know not that they lie it's like playing poker right like
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:16.880]  you know it it i just wouldn't read into that
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:20.960]  i do think there's probably some truth to the fact that the iphone 12 mini is
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:25.040]  not setting the world on fire that it's not some kind of smash hit and
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:28.800]  you know they they even said you know in a sec
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:32.160]  legally liable way you know that those statements on the quarterly
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:35.600]  analyst call that the the pro models are selling
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:39.760]  higher than they expected yeah that's a thing they said as a fact and it helps
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:43.760]  explain the the bump in revenue i i'm not
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:47.040]  worried about the 12 minis future i i think it's
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:51.040]  i think it's it's such a good product and i kind of feel
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:54.800]  like the people who at most appeals to are not
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:57.920]  even if they're an enthusiast like you right not just
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:00.960]  it's yeah just give me a small phone you know i don't know
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:04.640]  or type of people who just only ever buy phones when their old phone
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:09.040]  literally breaks i it's just such a good product i i
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:12.480]  and i can't help but think that it must be selling well enough that it
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:16.560]  it's probably not too far out outside their projections
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:20.480]  yeah i don't know right and i feel like if it's not selling well i mean
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:23.680]  well i mean part of the reason why it might not be selling well if it isn't is
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:27.280]  the fact that they they just introduced like the replacement
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:30.800]  like if you're an se owner right who's been holding out forever
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:35.680]  hoping that there's going to be a smaller phone they released the se
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:41.360]  in march yeah right and then six months later they released another phone like
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:45.760]  so i mean i bought two because i'm an idiot but
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:49.280]  i mean i couldn't wait any longer really i mean that that phone was really on its
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:52.160]  last legs and i had had the battery replaced but
[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:55.200]  it really could not hold much of a charge anymore
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:45:00.480]  and so i i mean i got i got the se and then
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:03.920]  when they released the phone that i really want i sold the se and got
[01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:06.960]  got the one that i really wanted which but most people particularly in the
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:11.120]  middle of a pandemic aren't going to be willing to do that yeah
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:14.880]  well anyway i love it i i think it's just such a great product i love the way
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:18.640]  it felt in the hand and and uh now now i'm second guessing myself
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:22.720]  for buying the the regular 12 but anyway
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:26.240]  uh the other and the other thing i was going to mention getting back to
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:32.560]  um snell's report card is that uh i feel i felt like kind of maybe
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:35.920]  the iphone got a little bit of short shrift in that report card because
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:39.600]  uh because everybody was booing and eyeing over the max
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:43.600]  um which you know is understandable but the i think that the the
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:46.640]  design change is is awesome i mean i think
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:51.040]  moving back to the straight sides which is a weird thing for me because i don't
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:53.840]  think i liked them when the iphone 4 came out
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:59.680]  um but now i love them and i was you know thrilled particularly
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:03.760]  moving from the second se to the 12 mini
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:07.200]  that i mean the just the feel of it is so much nicer with the
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:11.440]  with the straight edges all right speaking of straight edges
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:16.640]  um yeah you also which which i find weird okay go ahead and introduce the
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:19.680]  story you introduced the story uh it's we're
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:23.680]  talking about the rumors of the the upcoming macbook pros that are
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:27.440]  supposedly coming in the third quarter perhaps right and we'll
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:30.800]  we'll include a redesign along with obviously the
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:33.760]  new chips right uh it started with ming chi
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:38.000]  quo on january 14th and then followed up a day later
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.440]  uh by mark german at uh bloomberg and then german a week a week again a week
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:47.040]  later had even more information i found it odd that both of them
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:49.600]  described the redesign as having straight edges
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:54.000]  that's what i thought too like i mind you know looking at this
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.840]  laptop here it kind of already has straight edges and it is it just going
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:00.960]  to be thicker so the edges go down further
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:03.680]  which i don't why would people want that i don't
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:06.800]  i'm not exactly i'm not exactly sure what that was supposed to
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:09.840]  how that's supposed to play out i think that they're both
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:13.200]  describing it poorly what i and again i have zero
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:16.720]  zero little birdie information on this at all
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:20.240]  all i'm doing is reading what german and ming chi quo
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:26.720]  wrote and extrapolating from what i perceive as apple's
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:32.640]  design trends overall and i think what they mean is that the top and bottom
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:37.760]  will be flat and so the sort of belly design
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:43.440]  of mac books is going away yeah so it would be like a truly more like
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:47.440]  a book where you could rest something on top of
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:50.640]  it put close your current or a current ipad
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:55.120]  with like a lid yeah like yeah or like an ipad in
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:58.400]  in the smart uh keyboard case right that it's
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:03.680]  it's a more geometrically perfect you know just a flat surface on the top and
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:07.040]  bottom which to me that's what i think they
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:09.920]  mean because the strip the sides already are flat
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:13.840]  right on these things that's the crazy part of and they both describe them the
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:17.360]  same way which is very strange but i think that once you see
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:21.360]  it and and my guy i i'm not you know i don't have a rendering
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:25.120]  here to show you but i think that once we see it it'll
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:27.600]  it'll look weird at first because we haven't had
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:34.160]  flat topped macbooks i mean ever as to my recollection i don't think
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:39.200]  apple's ever made a laptop with oh the no the titanium was probably the
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:44.240]  closest they got right yeah yeah maybe the titanium was um
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:48.480]  but even the ones like like let's say like the uh
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:52.800]  there have been some that have had more of a and a good comparison is just to
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:55.600]  the back of the ipad right like the remember the
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:00.480]  original ipad had was like a rocker huge kind of a big curve yeah a very big
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:06.560]  curve and apple has long used that sort of
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:13.440]  curved back surface shape to disguise how thick
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:17.440]  to create the illusion of a thinner device than it actually is and it works
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:22.560]  it actually does work where you really only realize how thick the original ipad
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:26.080]  is once you get you compare it to like a brand new one with the flat and you're
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:30.000]  like oh my god the original ipad was fat why did i think this was so amazingly
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:33.200]  thin when i got it right yeah yeah i'm looking at a picture of a
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:37.360]  titanium powerbook and you can see i mean it would be kind of
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:40.320]  cool it obviously wouldn't be nearly as thick
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:44.480]  right um but that that's you know again like the
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:50.160]  uh the iphone 12s it would it's a nice design choice yeah i
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:53.040]  think once we see it will it'll make the all the existing ones
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:56.960]  look fat and make them feel fat
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:50:01.120]  i do um that's what i think they're talking about and you're making it sound
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:04.960]  like it's gonna hurt their feelings well i think they use those curves not
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:07.200]  because they think they're good but because again
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:10.720]  i think it's entirely a trick to make the overall device seem slimmer than it
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:13.360]  really is and and the best way to look at it is the
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:18.400]  iMac right so the iMacs now there's there's been like
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:23.440]  the current overall design of the iMac has had like two eras there's the one
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:26.720]  where it was an inch thick even at the edges
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:30.080]  right at the edge of the display it was still like an inch thick
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:34.000]  and then they redesigned it like five years five six years ago to come
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:41.840]  come to almost to a point yeah like a point you know and
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:44.960]  i forget what they said when they described it but they they really made
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:47.520]  it seem as though that's how thick the whole iMac was
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:52.400]  whereas you know the the belly part of the back really gets thick by the time
[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:55.040]  it gets to the middle but it you know but it is
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:58.080]  it definitely looks sleeker than the ones that were thick
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:01.920]  all the way to the edges apparently that's another one of german's reports
[01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:05.040]  was that the the new iMac will be flat across the back
[01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:08.640]  as well and that also confirms to me what he's talking about with the
[01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:12.400]  the macbooks laptops yeah right that they won't be any curve on the back
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:16.960]  and it's you know it's it's not even i don't think it's a sign
[01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:20.880]  of i think apple would have gone flat years ago if they could have but they
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:24.560]  didn't because they couldn't you know that they internally
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:26.800]  know that that's more aesthetically pleasing
[01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:31.120]  but that for the size of the components and the amount of cooling they need
[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:34.240]  they couldn't and now that these machines are so much cooler
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:37.520]  they can oh yeah they can go smaller right right
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:40.400]  and that was that was the thing that you know i mean it didn't stop me from
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:45.920]  buying this laptop obviously because i i was working on a 2016 macbook pro
[01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:51.600]  and i was pretty much done with it well it was getting slow enough and the
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:57.120]  keyboard was bugging me enough that um i was ready for a new device
[01:51:57.120 --> 01:52:00.240]  and but at the same time i was thinking they're gonna
[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:03.280]  they're gonna change the form factor i know they're gonna do that
[01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:06.800]  and i'm gonna i'm gonna be looking at the new ones that come out and being
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:10.080]  envious of those but i decided to go ahead and pull the trigger yeah
[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:15.040]  well both of them both quo and uh german are saying q3
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:19.040]  at the earliest which would be after july so if you need a new computer i
[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:23.120]  i wouldn't these rumors do sound good um but if you
[01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:27.520]  need a new computer now pros right supposedly and then german had a
[01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:31.920]  report that there's a new redesigned macbook air
[01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:35.520]  that would be the end of next year or 2022
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:39.360]  so i i think that's so early because they just came out with a brand new
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:42.800]  macbook air you know i think it makes and you know so the timing makes sense
[01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:45.840]  that if german's information is accurate it makes sense
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:50.800]  that it would be come out like one year after the current macbook air
[01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:55.600]  or even later um so the other thing that's interesting
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:52:58.080]  about these rumors other than the shape is the
[01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:04.000]  they both say the touch bar is gone and replaced with function keys which i
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:08.080]  find very odd so there's the what are the touch bar
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:12.160]  gone mag safe comes back and it's like
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:19.120]  some kind of possibly other ports and sd sd uh slot i don't i mean i missed
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:25.520]  mag miss mag safe a bit um i didn't miss it that much though with the
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:29.040]  with the macbook pro because i liked being able to plug it in
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:34.400]  on either side i thought that was a nice trade-off or good enough trade-off for
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:37.920]  me um now this air only has two ports and
[01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:40.480]  they're on one side i wish they were on opposite
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:45.280]  sides but it's okay i'll live with it
[01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:49.760]  um one of my questions let's take these in order so
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:56.480]  mag safe coming back i would say hooray um wouldn't you
[01:53:56.480 --> 01:54:00.400]  i i miss like i said like i mean i i didn't miss it
[01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:03.280]  i didn't miss it all that much i missed it okay i i
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:07.120]  i didn't usually have a big problem with like kicking up
[01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:10.720]  because i the way i the way i i like to operate is
[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:16.880]  i i like to have 12 plugs all over the house
[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:20.640]  so any desk or table that i sit down to i can plug in the device i don't i mean
[01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:26.800]  i usually have like two or three um but and so i don't i have them situated
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:29.120]  so that they're like draped over the back of the
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:32.240]  the desk for the different desks that i sat um
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:36.800]  and so i'm never concerned about like kicking a cord and having the laptop go
[01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:41.120]  flying it's happened once or twice to me since
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:44.080]  but the thing that's a little bit more unusual
[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:50.480]  about magsafe coming back now by having gone away when it did is that
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:54.400]  the m the biggest difference with the m1 and intel is that the battery lasts so
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:56.880]  much longer so that you really don't need to you
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:55:00.240]  don't need to plug it in as much right and so the and the places where
[01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:02.960]  you're likely to be plugged in like at your desk
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:06.000]  i i would guess most people have a desk set up where the
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.200]  the plug isn't kickable right it's sort of like
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:13.040]  that's like a coffee table situation or working it temporarily at the kitchen
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:16.960]  counter situation like the type of situations
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:19.760]  where magsafe seems the most applicable
[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:22.720]  because the the power plug or you know or or the
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:28.400]  airport situation uh remember airports right but you know
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:32.560]  hey i got a seat with a power plug over there and i can plug my thing in but now
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:36.800]  you know somebody might roll their suitcase over the cord but it's still
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:39.840]  better than better than not having it i like it
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:41.760]  but my big question and neither of them
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:45.040]  answer it is okay let's say they bring it back and and both
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:48.400]  or at least one of them had a report that it's not like the phone's
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:52.000]  magsafe where it's like low-powered magnetic it's
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.360]  high power high watt right because you can't do like
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:59.920]  87 watt charging with the phone's magsafe like in fact the
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:04.560]  phone's magsafe is lower than even plugged in lightning let alone high
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:10.080]  capacity usb-c um so so it will probably look something
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:13.600]  like what it used to be right it's not going to be just like a
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:16.160]  i mean the first thing that i envisioned is like well maybe they're going to do
[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:20.000]  it differently and it'll be like the pencil charges on the ipad but
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.360]  it's probably not that you know where it's just it's just a
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:26.800]  magnet and it connects no it's probably going to be like some
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:31.040]  sort of exposed pins and a magnet i think it has to be to do
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:35.120]  the high watt charging right and i don't think that low watt
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:38.480]  charging makes sense for a macbook it's their batteries are
[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:41.600]  too big you know it's you don't charge you know it'll take
[01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:46.000]  too long right but my big question is let's say it's true and they bring back
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:51.520]  magsafe uh does usb-c still work to charge too
[01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:56.240]  and i would think the answer is yes even though neither of them mention it
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:56:58.960]  because for example with the iphone you can charge
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:03.040]  magnetically on the back or plug lightning in right because it would
[01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:07.200]  stink that okay let's say you've already got usb-c
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:11.760]  chargers all around your house right now you buy this new thing
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:15.680]  now you've got this new thing and it has magsafe which is cool but it comes with
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:20.000]  only one magsafe charger hopefully right
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:25.040]  hopefully it comes with the charger um but now when you carry it into your
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:28.720]  kitchen and there's usb chargers right there if
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:32.000]  you plugged in usb-c even though it has magsafe that you
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:35.680]  could use if you plug in usb-c why wouldn't that work too
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:39.120]  i mean hopefully i don't know it's a little bit weird
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:43.200]  to me that that they bring back magsafe at the point where the battery lasts as
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:47.360]  long as it does but okay yeah um i mean i you know i think it's
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:49.840]  good right because i think in general people
[01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:53.520]  liked magsafe and i think more people miss it than not
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:59.200]  right uh bringing back the sd card slot again a little bit surprising to me
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:04.800]  yeah um because i i i kind of agree with the argument that they took the sd card
[01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:08.560]  slots out too early that people were still using them but i
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:12.240]  kind of feel like they've waited it out to this point and that people are using
[01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:15.520]  them less and less and it's you know if
[01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:17.920]  anything of all these things that you might need
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:23.760]  a peripheral for like a dongle sd card slot has always felt to me like
[01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:26.480]  it's pretty fair and i know that you know i know that
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:28.560]  there are some people who really really really
[01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:31.760]  really really want a built-in sd card slot
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:35.360]  but i just you know maybe i'm being selfish because i don't
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:38.720]  use one that frequently yeah i don't either but
[01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:42.480]  yeah it's hard not to see a couple of these things
[01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:45.680]  as possibly you know and the timing sort of works out
[01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:49.280]  with you know where i'm going with this right
[01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:53.440]  a guy named remember the uh johnny i've
[01:58:54.320 --> 01:59:01.680]  vaguely he was a uh designer at apple uh
[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:06.880]  i you know it's it's hard not to draw the conclusion that
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:12.000]  maybe johnny ives leaving apple and the return of things like magsafe and
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:16.640]  sd card slots uh are related something to do with each other yeah
[01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:19.760]  i mean it could be a coincidence you know but it's
[01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:23.840]  that both of those seem like backtrackings to me
[01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:27.920]  it yeah well they are right i mean i mean literally
[01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:31.360]  but it's you know i mean it would be different if if they had made
[01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:37.920]  devices that didn't fit them at all right like literally were so thin
[01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:40.800]  that they couldn't make a magsafe connector
[01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:47.520]  that would fit the device right and you know i i i've spoken to
[01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:52.320]  people apple i really do think that the the headphone jack thing is really is
[01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:54.960]  about space and it's not that they couldn't make
[01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:58.320]  phones that had a headphone jack but that by taking
[01:59:58.320 --> 02:00:01.680]  the headphone jack out it saves a significant amount of space because
[02:00:01.680 --> 02:00:06.080]  headphone jacks uh it's not just the the diameter of the
[02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:09.760]  jack it's how far into the device they go
[02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:16.400]  in that that is it you know in the annual design war of what
[02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:19.920]  goes into the next generation iphones that amount of
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:24.640]  volume is a huge amount of turf inside an iphone
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:27.920]  magsafe to me they've never made a mac book that
[02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:31.440]  doesn't have room for magsafe
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:36.560]  so i it really felt like it felt like an aesthetic decision
[02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:41.520]  i mean and to me the most aesthetic decision they've ever made on that front
[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:47.200]  was the the just plain no adjective 12-inch macbook that literally only had
[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:51.040]  one one port or i guess two it had a uh
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:54.480]  one usb-c port and one headphone jack and that's it
[02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:58.080]  right because that it's it really felt spiteful
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:01.920]  i mean it just really did it you know and and
[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:07.520]  if it had been one usb-c port and magsafe that would be different right
[02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:10.080]  and you could still see the argument that
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:15.840]  hey i would like two usb ports you know but not being able to charge
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:20.640]  the device while you use any usb-c peripheral
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:26.880]  really is it it's it's almost incomprehensible it's
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:30.960]  and it's hard not to think that it was a purely aesthetic decision driven by
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:34.320]  johnny ive's team you know because it certainly doesn't seem it wasn't a
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:38.960]  functional decision it's incredibly impractical it always
[02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:42.080]  was it's it's there's almost not much to say about
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:45.200]  it like what you know two ports really seems like the minimum
[02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:49.120]  especially if those ports are the charging ports i mean i think
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:52.240]  yeah johnny i mean johnny's idea was that everybody would do things over the
[02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:54.400]  air and not like so you could charge because you
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:59.360]  wouldn't have anything plugged into his right why would you plug anything it is
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:03.040]  beautiful laptop yeah why not just have no ports at
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:06.000]  all and you could just use the charge that it comes from the factory with
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:10.240]  until and then throw it out and buy a new one
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:13.520]  and well put it on your shelf
[02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:17.440]  and it's quite frankly more attractive when it's closed
[02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:22.960]  well your bathroom yes turn it off and close it up
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:27.920]  you've watched i remember what the original macbook air came with in terms
[02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:32.400]  of ports um magsafe and two usb i think
[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:39.040]  that sounds right yeah the touch bar going away is also
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:44.400]  very interesting and i i've long espoused from the get-go
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:51.520]  through now and now that i'm using a macbook pro with the touch bar uh
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:55.760]  i am so neutral on the touch bar it's it's ridiculous
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:59.360]  i think i am as well i don't hate it um but
[02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:03.520]  i also don't i basically configured it as a control strip anyway so it's
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:09.840]  i'm not really using it as i think apple thinks that you should use it right and
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:13.520]  i totally get it that there are other people and i know it's just
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:17.280]  it's very divisive there are some people who truly hate it really really hate it
[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:19.840]  and i believe them i believe that they hate it
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:22.880]  and therefore it's super frustrating to them
[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:26.480]  that it's not configurable that you can't do a build to
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:30.880]  order and get a 16-inch macbook pro that does not have
[02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:35.520]  the touch bar um because that you know that would i sympathize i know i have
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:38.960]  strong opinions about certain things i don't about the touch bar
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:43.280]  but all things considered if i could configure it if i could have the
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:46.720]  exact same macbook right now with or without the touch bar i would probably
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:49.520]  take the touch bar i i i think i like it better than the
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:53.200]  function keys i do now that they have the escape key the escape key was the
[02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:56.320]  thing that that absolutely that never really
[02:03:56.320 --> 02:04:00.800]  bothered me that much i i you i turns out i use the escape key
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:05.280]  more than i thought and i don't use i don't use vi uh but i use it more than
[02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:09.520]  i thought and it it really bothered me okay uh
[02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:15.360]  i also personally find that the fraction of an inch like it's like a
[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:19.440]  16th of an inch maybe even less than a 16th of an inch that they moved the
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:23.120]  touch bar up past the number row you know the one
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:27.840]  two three four row of keys totally eliminated my occasional
[02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:31.360]  accidental touches of the touch bar okay but once
[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:34.240]  again it i i know that it's very hard to see that
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:37.840]  difference but on the original ones i did run into
[02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:40.320]  that problem once in a while and i no longer do
[02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:43.680]  but i understand that other people might type faster and
[02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:47.200]  more sloppily than i do or with bigger fingers and that they still run into
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:52.080]  that problem um but it's i can't if this is true
[02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:55.120]  that they're going to come out with just get rid of the touch bar across the
[02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:58.320]  line with the 16 inch and that the the truly
[02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:03.200]  pro pro 13 inch macbook pros i'm fascinated to see what they say
[02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:06.640]  about it because this that seems isn't that i
[02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:10.400]  think they'll say anything yeah i think they won't say anything
[02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:13.760]  just just pretend like it was never a thing just pretend it never existed
[02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:20.080]  just never existed i wonder so maybe maybe that's you know on stage or if i
[02:05:20.080 --> 02:05:25.440]  don't know if we'll have on stage by the third quarter but
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:31.440]  you know in the video you know in their in their prepared
[02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:36.400]  show to unveil them i can imagine that they won't even mention it
[02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:39.680]  um but they're going to get asked about it
[02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:45.440]  so i'm curious what then their answer will be even off the record you know in
[02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:47.920]  a press briefing type thing i'm sure they'll come up with
[02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:52.960]  something yeah yeah right but if it's true that's a real backtracking
[02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:59.120]  and i'm a little surprised i i don't know in the back of my head i
[02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:03.600]  thought hmm okay clearly even if i don't mind the
[02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:07.440]  touch bar there's enough people who hate it where
[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:11.120]  this is a problem and therefore they need to do something
[02:06:11.120 --> 02:06:14.160]  but i would have thought the solution is to come up with a
[02:06:14.160 --> 02:06:19.360]  second generation touch bar that solves the problems people have and makes it
[02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:21.360]  compelling okay how do we make this more
[02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:26.240]  compelling because fundamentally the basic idea that i see is that
[02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:30.640]  a row of twiddly little function keys is so
[02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:36.400]  un-apple-like it's it's unaesthetic it's you know it's kind of gross in my
[02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:38.400]  opinion and you could say well but it works
[02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:44.720]  right but it's like it i don't know like why i'm why would you
[02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:48.400]  want to use that word gross i don't it's gross
[02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:52.960]  i i'm i i'm i'm in tune like a little bit of an
[02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:56.400]  exaggeration no i think it's gross i i don't know
[02:06:56.400 --> 02:07:01.920]  there's some it's like gross is maybe a strong word but it is it's gross it's
[02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:06.800]  gross and fiddly in in the way that like a text mode in a
[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:10.480]  computer boot sequence is gross and fiddly like when you used to
[02:07:10.480 --> 02:07:15.040]  boot up a windows pc and you'd see all this dos crap flying by
[02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:18.720]  telling you it's loading auto exec bat dot dot dot and then all
[02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:22.480]  then you get the windows logo right and now you're in graphical mode
[02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:27.520]  and there's a reason why max never have never booted with like a stream of dos
[02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:31.040]  like text before you see the graphical
[02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:34.320]  interface of an apple logo or the mac logo or whatever they boot
[02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:38.560]  with it's gross and function keys are gross
[02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:44.640]  in that spectrum and it also is so i'm here's an area where like all
[02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:47.120]  right i think like hey getting rid of magsafe
[02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:50.480]  putting only one usb-c port on a macbook i'm
[02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:56.240]  i'm you've gone too far johnny i've the function keys i'm i'm totally aligned
[02:07:56.240 --> 02:07:58.640]  with johnny i've they're gross and they
[02:07:58.640 --> 02:08:00.800]  should have there should be something better
[02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:05.760]  what why i but you you i'm assuming you do not agree with the with the arrow
[02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:10.640]  keys though i no i could no i definitely i i i hate i
[02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:13.680]  hated the uh full height left and right arrow keys
[02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:17.360]  i really i felt i felt so strong about them that when i was using a mac with
[02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:21.600]  those i literally put uh pieces of gaff tape
[02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:25.840]  on the left right keys so that i could feel them
[02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:30.560]  which is really gross i had little pieces of tape on my keys right so
[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:33.520]  i get it right well that's good i mean i kind of feel like though that there's
[02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:38.640]  this there's a minimum amount of like functional usage
[02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:44.240]  that you have to live with uh i mean a level of quote grossness unquote i mean
[02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:49.440]  and that's a that's an example i i i am perfectly fine with the air the um
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:52.720]  function keys frankly i mean i i feel like you know johnny
[02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:55.360]  would have preferred if all the keys were the same size
[02:08:55.360 --> 02:09:00.000]  so like like like you'd have a square space bar yeah yeah
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:06.240]  the tab key is just the size of why is the space bar so large
[02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:11.360]  it's unseemly and just arrange them all on a perfect grid
[02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:16.960]  and it's so much easier it's so much easier on the eyes
[02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:21.440]  your fingers will adjust um i don't know i can't think of a better
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:25.600]  a better example than a computer that boots up with some kind of
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:31.200]  diagnostic boot loading text first it's it's honest it's just
[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:34.320]  unaesthetic and function keys are that type of thing
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:37.280]  and you know steve jobs had feelings like this too right there's this famous
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:41.280]  story of somebody who had like my beloved apple extended keyboard too
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:45.440]  and wanted jobs to sign it and he's like what are all these keys do i have all
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:48.080]  these keys on it and he started prying off the guy's keys
[02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:51.840]  and then he signed his name on the back but you know why doesn't apple ship
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:55.440]  keyboards with 110 keys anymore even the big ones
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:59.200]  because it the extra keys are they're gross
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:04.720]  to some you know a little gross just a little gross you know
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:08.960]  it's like one you know i don't know i think it's not like a whole you know
[02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:11.600]  like somebody dropped a bag of barber hair in your food
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:13.360]  but it's like finding a hair in your food
[02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:19.280]  you know it's a little gross uh so i get it like i think there's
[02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:23.040]  there's a general aesthetic and part of its marketing and part of it i think is
[02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:26.000]  just not getting it but i just saw an ad from
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.880]  microsoft i think it was when i was watching football on sunday
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:33.680]  um where they had like a teenage kid talking about why he wanted a surface
[02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:38.000]  instead of a mac laptop and he was saying like look they get apple gives
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.400]  you a little this little touch thing up here
[02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:45.440]  microsoft gives me a whole touch screen and i i i know that you know if you if
[02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:49.600]  you have a touch screen and apple doesn't that's a way you can
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:51.600]  market it and they've been trying that for years
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:55.360]  um so i don't blame them for marketing it that way but
[02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:58.960]  i've seen reviewers talk about this too that
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:02.960]  thinking that the touch bar is apple's answer to putting
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:07.280]  a touch screen on the mac and if why not just make the whole screen a touch
[02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:10.560]  screen i we don't definitely don't have time for me to
[02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:15.280]  reiterate my opposition to that but i am i'm 100 convinced that that
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:18.400]  has nothing to do with why they have a touch screen or touch bar
[02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:21.120]  why they tried the touch bar the touch bar wasn't
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:24.960]  okay people want some kind of touch screen we don't want to make the top
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:27.920]  screen touch so we'll give them this i think it's
[02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:33.600]  basically function keys are some ancient idea from 1973's
[02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:37.440]  you know terminal computers they're gross it's ridiculous
[02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:40.480]  and even though we've repurposed them all from traditional
[02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:45.120]  functions to dedicated things like hey here's one for brightness
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:49.040]  here's two for i guess three three for volume up down
[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:52.480]  yeah and so i guess that's what i would i mean and that's how i use them and
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:57.280]  that's why i configured the touch bar like that and i would be i
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:01.760]  mean i'm looking at i'm sitting in between an ancient
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:07.360]  almost ancient macbook um the the unibody plastic macbook that's
[02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:11.600]  what i usually record on and i keep i change nothing so that my
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:14.400]  recordings work because i know my recordings work
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:16.880]  and i have this laptop and i'm not using it for anything else
[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:20.240]  and so i record all my podcasts on that on that laptop
[02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:23.680]  and it which is great and then i have the
[02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:30.240]  this you know new macbook air and the i would see the icons on
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:36.320]  the macbook are better because they are much more oriented like
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:39.920]  the the function is larger you know like the
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:42.960]  this stop start whatever sleep i mean all
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:45.600]  those those icons are larger and then the f
[02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:50.880]  numbers are smaller and in the corner um i would i would even go so far as to
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:54.000]  like remove the f numbers i don't think i ever use
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:13:00.560]  the f numbers personally and but the on the air they're smaller but
[02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:03.200]  they're in the middle which makes them a little bit more prominent
[02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:07.040]  um and i think they actually better the old way but anyway i mean like i say
[02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:09.440]  like i was i would think that it would be better
[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:13.760]  to just have the like the new functions on them and not have the f numbers on
[02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:15.600]  them at all although i guess lots of people still
[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:19.920]  use the f but it it it gets exactly to steve jobs's
[02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:24.320]  explanation of why the iphone only had a home button
[02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:28.640]  it back in 2007 where it's like look all these other smartphones have all these
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:32.400]  buttons at the bottom and it takes up all this space and
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:36.720]  and they can only do one thing once you put like a green button for
[02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:40.320]  make a phone call and a red button for hang up a phone phone call
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:44.960]  and it's a hardware button that space is always occupied by those buttons and you
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:47.200]  might come up maybe you make the device and then you
[02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:52.400]  come up with new ideas and you you can't add buttons you know and
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:54.480]  we have it we've we figured out we already have a
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:57.440]  solution to this it's called software and if we made the whole
[02:13:57.440 --> 02:14:00.560]  screen a touch screen we could do it all in software
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:05.440]  but that that argument fits like so you've got all of these buttons like i
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:08.960]  i never i almost never play music on my max
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:12.560]  ever i just if i play music i play it on home pods or i
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:16.720]  listen to it on my iphone i i can't tell you the last time i've
[02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:22.320]  used the play pause fast forward buttons on the keyboard i mean like ever i and
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:25.360]  going back to when they first added dedicated buttons for it
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:29.440]  i never use them so why are they there i'm always looking at them what about
[02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:32.560]  the weird button on f4 where it's like what happens if i
[02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:35.920]  i don't even know what happens all right goes to the uh
[02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:40.560]  what's that thing called that's the the alternative launch screen
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:44.320]  oh yeah i've never used it so i don't even know what it's called
[02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:49.600]  um i don't i don't even know what it's called launchpad
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:53.440]  yeah launchpad so there's a dedicated button on my keyboard for launchpad
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:57.920]  now i could go in and use keyboard maestro or something in system
[02:14:57.920 --> 02:15:00.800]  preferences and make that button do something else
[02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:04.880]  but i can never get the glyph removed from the key cap
[02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:08.720]  right and then the one for uh the all windows mode
[02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:12.080]  it's like it's an ugly looking icon with a bunch of
[02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:16.960]  rectangles in weird spots it's gross the whole thing is gross and
[02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:21.200]  the touch bar and i i'm convinced the whole point of the touch bar was
[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:24.320]  all right let's take this fiddly old thing from the 1970s
[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:27.520]  yeah and let's do some what's a new idea and okay
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:31.040]  it wasn't good enough i i'm just surprised they're not coming back with
[02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:34.240]  like touch bar 2.0 well and i thought they would have done
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:38.400]  that before now right i mean i thought they i thought oh they would
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:41.600]  introduce this new thing it's software based they will
[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:44.720]  iterate it and you know even if it's clunky like the watch
[02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:48.080]  even if it's a little clunky to begin with it'll be
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:51.360]  good by the next version and then there never really was a next you know much of
[02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:54.320]  a next version anyway yeah they made some very small changes to
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:58.800]  it um and i could not get used to
[02:15:58.800 --> 02:16:02.240]  the idea i mean i understand the the concept for the
[02:16:02.240 --> 02:16:06.720]  phone it it's it's a little bit more obvious on the phone though i guess the
[02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:10.080]  end when the entire interface changes but i never wanted to get
[02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:13.760]  i never wanted to get into the the business of
[02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:17.280]  configuring the touch bar for different applications
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:20.320]  no me neither because i found that i found that crazy confusing
[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:23.360]  like i'm now i'm in a different application and the touch bar
[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:26.480]  behaves completely differently yeah i don't either
[02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:30.560]  i almost i will admit i almost never use it and i just use it for volume and
[02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:32.800]  brightness and yeah so that's what yeah i mean that's
[02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:35.040]  why i changed it to a control strip and that's
[02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:39.520]  what i used it yeah uh but i the other thing for me is i just never looked down
[02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:43.120]  there even though i'm right there using it and in the flow using my mac for
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:45.360]  hours i'm like staring at the screen and i'm
[02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:48.800]  typing on the keyboard and it just never even occurs to me to
[02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:51.440]  look there and every once in a while i'm using an app and it's like hey there's
[02:16:51.440 --> 02:16:54.720]  something i might want to use there you know like sometimes you you'd be
[02:16:54.720 --> 02:16:57.520]  typing in a password and it'll have like a couple of
[02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:00.640]  email addresses to choose from for filling in a form
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:03.360]  it's like hey that's actually kind of easy i didn't even realize that was
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:07.520]  there because i never look at it i don't know it's just interesting to me
[02:17:07.520 --> 02:17:10.560]  if it's true that they're just getting just saying you know what we're calling
[02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:14.240]  it quits on this thing uh it's it's hard to think of
[02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:18.880]  something they've backtracked so far on right because it's different when you
[02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:22.880]  backtrack on okay we took out built-in sd card slots now we're putting it back
[02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:24.480]  in and they can just say look we didn't
[02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:28.000]  have room for them for a couple years now we you know because of the m1 or the
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.160]  m2 or whatever they're up to by the time these
[02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:35.120]  machines come out uh it's so space it's so small and so space efficient we have
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:40.240]  room to add sd card slots um they're back and it's you can sell it
[02:17:40.240 --> 02:17:43.680]  whereas the and you could and they could even spin
[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:47.360]  it that way with magsafe you know the the we've come back with magsafe 3 and
[02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:50.720]  it's better than ever but the touch bar is going to be a
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:53.920]  tough one to spin you know other than that's why i think
[02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:56.560]  that's why i think they won't mention yeah other than just saying well you
[02:17:56.560 --> 02:18:01.200]  know didn't work out work out
[02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:09.680]  uh anything else from these rumors uh that that jumps out to you
[02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:15.840]  um it's so the the the sizes i think the sizes they mentioned were like a
[02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:19.760]  14 and 16 inch yeah macbook pro yeah yeah
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:24.720]  yeah uh well the weird which makes sense yeah the weird thing about the 14 inch
[02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:28.160]  is it seems they've talked about a 14 inch for years yeah it's been rumored
[02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:32.160]  for so long and it has not appeared and that's the part where
[02:18:32.160 --> 02:18:36.240]  it's like gee i wish it was my job and i had all the time all day that i could
[02:18:36.240 --> 02:18:39.200]  look it up and do the claim chowder on this and i so i
[02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:44.320]  guess i should um that's the thing that throws the hey
[02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:46.960]  wait a minute aren't you the guys who told me the 14
[02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:51.040]  inch was coming two years ago
[02:18:51.440 --> 02:18:55.760]  you know it's like where where did that come from i i've you know
[02:18:55.760 --> 02:18:59.280]  there's you know it's sort of like the way that this game works where there's
[02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:01.760]  some where there's smoke there's fire and i
[02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:05.600]  guess somebody in the supply chain was started working on 14-inch laptop
[02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:10.480]  screens for apple and somebody else grossly misinterpreted
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:15.520]  when they might be coming um my guess is i mean i can see them moving i can see
[02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:20.880]  them moving to a 12 inch error 14 inch and 16 inch pros but
[02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:24.480]  well and the the i'm not sure if that's necessary either
[02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:29.200]  well the the 15 inch to 16 inch transition for the macbook pro i think
[02:19:29.200 --> 02:19:32.560]  is exactly what's going to happen with this 13 to 14 inch where i don't think
[02:19:32.560 --> 02:19:36.320]  they're going to make a bigger footprint i think they'll just reduce the bezel
[02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:40.720]  size even further and it'll be round up to 14 instead of 13 inches
[02:19:40.720 --> 02:19:44.480]  yeah uh i think german's report said that there's some
[02:19:44.480 --> 02:19:48.400]  and some talk about reducing the bezel size on the
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:53.760]  13 inch macbook air keeping the display at 13 inches but reducing the bezels and
[02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:57.200]  therefore making the footprint smaller um
[02:19:57.200 --> 02:20:00.800]  which kind of makes sense it's because it kind of makes sense that the air would
[02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:02.960]  be actually have a smaller footprint than
[02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:06.640]  the right macbook pro i was i was actually surprised because
[02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:09.760]  so the previous errors that i've had have been the um
[02:20:09.760 --> 02:20:16.400]  what 10 11 inch 11 inch right 11 yeah 11 was the old tiny one yeah and
[02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:19.760]  um this is so this is my first 13 inch air
[02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:23.680]  and i was kind of surprised at the bulk of it really i was thinking it
[02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:27.200]  oh it's an air it's going to be much smaller and you know much
[02:20:27.200 --> 02:20:32.400]  um or much lighter than my macbook pro my 13 inch macbook pro but it doesn't
[02:20:32.400 --> 02:20:35.520]  really feel that no no it's hardly it's hardly smaller at
[02:20:35.520 --> 02:20:40.480]  all it it is it it because it tapers
[02:20:40.480 --> 02:20:43.840]  it does have the tremendous advantage that i've still
[02:20:43.840 --> 02:20:49.200]  never got i haven't had a macbook air in years but once i got used to the
[02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:53.600]  ability to feel it coming out of my bag by touch i never
[02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:56.480]  ever put it down in front of me wrong whereas now i
[02:20:56.480 --> 02:21:00.480]  always half the time and it's that damn apple logo and i i
[02:21:00.480 --> 02:21:04.080]  agree that it's oriented the right way but now that i
[02:21:04.080 --> 02:21:08.720]  can't do it by feel i see the apple logo and i put it down in front of me hinged
[02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:11.680]  towards me and it's like ah i put it down you know
[02:21:11.680 --> 02:21:14.800]  how many years am i going to go while i do this but
[02:21:14.800 --> 02:21:18.240]  it's it's 2.8 pounds versus 3.0 pounds so it's
[02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:21.600]  hardly lighter it's actually thicker in the back
[02:21:21.600 --> 02:21:25.440]  like the back of the macbook air is actually ever so slightly thicker than
[02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:29.760]  the back of the macbook pro they're very oddly similarly sized for
[02:21:29.760 --> 02:21:33.840]  a device whose name implies that it's smaller yeah what did
[02:21:33.840 --> 02:21:36.400]  you so you got the air right that's your m1
[02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:41.360]  yeah yeah um so how do you like it so far i know you only had it today
[02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:48.240]  uh yeah thursday yeah i got a thursday um i love it i mean i'm glad
[02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:54.800]  i'm more pleased with it than the pro i think um i mean the keyboard is
[02:21:54.800 --> 02:21:57.600]  really it's really the big thing i never had
[02:21:57.600 --> 02:22:01.200]  the huge problems with the with the keyboard the old butterfly
[02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:07.280]  um keyboard but i never really liked the the fact that it had such low travel yeah
[02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:09.680]  i i never and i really i really hated the
[02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:13.120]  arrow keys yeah the arrow keys were what killed me and
[02:22:13.120 --> 02:22:18.080]  i i got used to the travel and i never bought ones i only ever used to review
[02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:21.680]  units for you know month or two at a time but i did you
[02:22:21.680 --> 02:22:24.960]  know it took a while to get used to the type you know a while like days and then
[02:22:24.960 --> 02:22:27.920]  i got used to it and but it's like oh this is so much better this is such a
[02:22:27.920 --> 02:22:31.120]  better dial it back you know and again i don't
[02:22:31.120 --> 02:22:33.760]  think it's backtracking i think this is sort of like
[02:22:33.760 --> 02:22:37.280]  it's just better this is just better yeah it's just sort of dialing it in
[02:22:37.280 --> 02:22:40.560]  you know a little bit too far ah just right
[02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:45.840]  yeah right uh the arrow keys i i could never get used to like i told you i i
[02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:50.720]  went so far as to put tape on them so i could feel them somehow yeah
[02:22:50.720 --> 02:22:54.080]  uh and i was clear i didn't really know that one of the things that i
[02:22:54.080 --> 02:22:58.640]  have used the touch bar for was um sleep um or not not sleep but locking the
[02:22:58.640 --> 02:23:01.280]  screen right um because you can add a button for
[02:23:01.280 --> 02:23:06.160]  locking the screen and i did not realize that the power button on the um
[02:23:06.160 --> 02:23:10.560]  the air does that now yeah if you just do it do a tap or not a tap but one push
[02:23:10.560 --> 02:23:14.080]  it locks the screen yeah the funny thing what's the funny thing
[02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:17.920]  oh i know the i still can't get used to it and it's so hard it's like
[02:23:17.920 --> 02:23:23.840]  you now that any key turns on your mac you know that if you power it down you
[02:23:23.840 --> 02:23:27.680]  can turn it on by like just like hitting any key
[02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:32.320]  i don't know that i powered it down yeah yeah you probably never will
[02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:35.920]  but it makes it hard well yeah i mean i'm probably gonna do it a lot less it
[02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:40.160]  makes it makes it hard to clean the keys because you have to like do it while the
[02:23:40.160 --> 02:23:44.240]  screen's on and locked um but i think that the explanation and
[02:23:44.240 --> 02:23:47.440]  again it's one of those things that apple's never going to say on the record
[02:23:47.440 --> 02:23:50.640]  and i've never gotten anybody off the record to say yeah that's the problem
[02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:54.080]  but now that the button doesn't have the power logo on it people didn't know how
[02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:59.120]  to turn the mac on oh yeah and i don't know if they could do
[02:23:59.120 --> 02:24:01.520]  that or not and it's like i don't know if they don't want to
[02:24:01.520 --> 02:24:05.280]  if they you know like if the the the power logo would
[02:24:05.280 --> 02:24:09.360]  get in the way of the fingerprint sensor or if they just think it's more
[02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:12.400]  aesthetic this way they should write it on the top on the
[02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:15.520]  on the edge of the the laptop but that's in between the key
[02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:19.120]  and the screen but it's and have an arrow pointing down to this just this
[02:24:19.120 --> 02:24:21.440]  power
[02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:26.320]  you know since johnny's gone yeah or just put a sticker on it you know
[02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:29.600]  put a put a sticker on this side with an arrow
[02:24:29.600 --> 02:24:34.320]  get rid of all all the function keys and just put stickers
[02:24:34.320 --> 02:24:37.680]  you can because you can replace stickers yeah yeah maybe that's maybe that is the
[02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:40.800]  answer if you do if you decide that the key
[02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:43.920]  should be something else later just give send out another sticker yeah
[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:47.840]  um you know i i've said this before when i was in high school i learned to type
[02:24:47.840 --> 02:24:52.080]  on manual typewriters not electric not just typewriters i'm talking
[02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:56.960]  manual clackety clack typewriters and i was in seventh grade and i weighed i
[02:24:56.960 --> 02:25:01.440]  weighed about 87 pounds and i was my entire
[02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:04.800]  torso was about as thick as a as a power
[02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:09.280]  power cable i was very skinny kid and my pinky my pinky fingers weren't
[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:13.440]  strong enough to i couldn't i couldn't i could press the a
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:16.880]  and the semicolon keys and the q and the z and the other ones you're supposed to
[02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:19.280]  do with your pinky but they i couldn't press them hard
[02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:22.400]  enough to actually get a letter to show up so it looked like i hit
[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:27.280]  space and and but we had these uh we had this room
[02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:30.880]  classroom full of manual typewriters that had no key caps
[02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:34.080]  they were all blank because they were specifically meant oh
[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:37.440]  because yeah you're supposed to learn how to write and uh they you know
[02:25:37.440 --> 02:25:40.640]  i feel like they could go that route you know for the johnny i've
[02:25:40.640 --> 02:25:44.240]  you know crowd you know sure yeah just print these keyboards up
[02:25:44.240 --> 02:25:48.160]  it would look a lot better too just blank all blank i think uh the das
[02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:51.280]  keyboard company das you know like the german
[02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:54.880]  das oh yeah uh i think they sell a keyboard that that's like that for
[02:25:54.880 --> 02:25:58.240]  this aesthetically purists you know yeah
[02:25:58.240 --> 02:26:02.320]  yeah uh the black black turtleneck crowd you know
[02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:07.520]  uh anything oh so what's not in the new one said last but not least is that
[02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:10.880]  apparently there's no face id and no cellular networking
[02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:14.560]  and according to these rumors from ming chi kuo mark german
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:18.960]  the face id the cellular i'm not surprised because i feel like the story
[02:26:18.960 --> 02:26:25.360]  on that is very complicated and the i just wish my mac could have
[02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:28.880]  cellular like my ipad does is i feel like the answer is more
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:32.480]  complicated than that but again apple doesn't really like to explain
[02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:35.040]  that the face id thing is a little bit more disappointing
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:39.680]  to me especially for the imac where it seems like that would be a natural
[02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:44.720]  right uh so i can't imagine why the imac doesn't have face id
[02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:49.120]  seems very weird because if it doesn't have face id
[02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:52.800]  that might mean it doesn't have any biometric authentication
[02:26:52.800 --> 02:26:57.280]  because i think that there is some kind of
[02:26:57.280 --> 02:27:02.640]  uh cryptographic problem yeah you can't do it in a in a non-connected
[02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:06.880]  key right right so you can't do it for reasons i don't i don't think i
[02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:10.560]  understand and don't even want to try to speculate on but you can't just make a
[02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:14.240]  bluetooth keyboard with it on and communicate well it's the same
[02:27:14.240 --> 02:27:16.560]  probably and that's why you know it's the same thing with
[02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:20.480]  uh it's it's a handshake between the the sensor
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:24.480]  and the whatever that chip is i can't remember the secure enclave
[02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:30.400]  the secure enclave yeah right um and that's why they you know that they
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:33.840]  had that whole thing where people were incensed because
[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:37.200]  they weren't letting third parties repair right
[02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:40.960]  um right do certain repairs because they would it would disconnect to those
[02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:44.480]  right those two and that would ruin the handshake right and so i don't know
[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:47.840]  you know we'll see if the rumors pan out but i hold out hope
[02:27:47.840 --> 02:27:51.040]  not because i again not because i have any info but just boy it would be nice
[02:27:51.040 --> 02:27:56.000]  for the imax to have you know face id uh
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.720]  other handful of rumors there's somebody you know people are saying they're going
[02:27:58.720 --> 02:28:02.080]  to actually make a display that costs a standalone
[02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:06.560]  display that costs less than five thousand dollars
[02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:10.400]  i'll believe it when i see it
[02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:15.920]  you know how like we always remember we always remember craig fedorigi's first
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:20.960]  ever on stage appearance when it his hand was shaking on the mouse
[02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:26.640]  uh i i feel like the john tournes equivalent of that it wasn't the first
[02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:29.200]  time we saw john tournes who just got a promotion to
[02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:33.280]  head of uh senior as senior vice president of hardware across the company
[02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:38.800]  um but to me the tournes moment is the at wwdc 2019 when they introduced he
[02:28:38.800 --> 02:28:43.200]  introduced the xdr display and said that the stand cost a thousand
[02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:51.200]  dollars yeah and i don't know like you you well
[02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:54.560]  you were watching remotely right oh yeah and it was
[02:28:54.560 --> 02:28:58.800]  it was obvious even on the stream that it got a poor reaction right i mean
[02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:02.640]  right but in the room it was it was like
[02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:06.960]  you know i don't know how somebody could fart so bad that all five
[02:29:06.960 --> 02:29:13.520]  five thousand people in the room could smell it but that was what it was like
[02:29:14.400 --> 02:29:18.240]  i know that yeah and i don't know how you um i mean given that that's
[02:29:18.240 --> 02:29:22.560]  that was the fact that was the price i'm not exactly sure how you introduce that
[02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:27.360]  price and and make it seem more palatable well
[02:29:27.360 --> 02:29:31.680]  how did they not see that coming right i right i think if there is such a thing
[02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:35.840]  as a thousand dollar display stand that apple made it i it
[02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:41.040]  is a true truly tremendous piece of kit and now that they're in the field it
[02:29:41.040 --> 02:29:44.880]  doesn't seem like anybody is saying hey i got it and now my display droops it's
[02:29:44.880 --> 02:29:48.240]  worn out already i mean if there is such a thing as a thousand
[02:29:48.240 --> 02:29:53.680]  dollar display stand i think that's it but it to me it
[02:29:53.680 --> 02:29:59.360]  only makes sense in the context of this is the big brother to this the
[02:29:59.360 --> 02:30:03.200]  i don't know what the reasonably priced standalone 5k
[02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:07.520]  display is but let's say the whole display including a built-in stand is
[02:30:07.520 --> 02:30:12.640]  fifteen hundred dollars yeah you know and it's great and it's 5k
[02:30:12.640 --> 02:30:16.960]  and it's just like our imac display and it does all the hdr cool stuff and
[02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:20.240]  it's super thin and it's it's really nice
[02:30:20.240 --> 02:30:24.480]  uh and for the pros out there we've got this pro display xdr that's five
[02:30:24.480 --> 02:30:26.640]  thousand dollars and has a thousand dollar stand
[02:30:26.640 --> 02:30:31.200]  but it all goes over better if there's like well oh yeah that's cool you know
[02:30:31.200 --> 02:30:35.360]  right right you know it's yeah it's the it's the it's the crazy expensive model
[02:30:35.360 --> 02:30:40.960]  and you can move up right yeah it's the you know like the the gold watch
[02:30:40.960 --> 02:30:45.600]  and that's the only watch we have right the apple watch 8 it
[02:30:45.600 --> 02:30:49.760]  comes in one model we've simplified it it's called
[02:30:49.760 --> 02:30:53.680]  and it's solid gold and it costs twenty thousand dollars
[02:30:53.680 --> 02:30:56.880]  right it's the apple watch announcement comes out
[02:30:56.880 --> 02:31:01.280]  real differently if the edition was the only version
[02:31:01.280 --> 02:31:04.720]  and that's but that's their display story at the moment right the only
[02:31:04.720 --> 02:31:07.760]  display they sell is effectively the apple display edition
[02:31:07.760 --> 02:31:11.680]  you know so right hopefully that that will come to pass but otherwise maybe
[02:31:11.680 --> 02:31:13.600]  they should have called it they should have called it that and they
[02:31:13.600 --> 02:31:18.480]  you know maybe should have made it gold yeah sure
[02:31:18.480 --> 02:31:22.320]  or an option yeah at least it's hard to believe that that's not an option gold
[02:31:22.320 --> 02:31:27.040]  gold-plated uh i mean anything else i think that's
[02:31:27.040 --> 02:31:30.480]  about it uh yeah i mean there's the there's the the
[02:31:30.480 --> 02:31:33.920]  um tim cook spoken of privacy oh yeah yeah i
[02:31:33.920 --> 02:31:37.360]  didn't watch that yet i i read the remarks i do want to watch
[02:31:37.360 --> 02:31:39.680]  yeah i read it i read it on six colors as well
[02:31:39.680 --> 02:31:43.920]  um and it was interesting because i thought i read i had seen a bunch of
[02:31:43.920 --> 02:31:46.320]  people say oh he really stuck into facebook and
[02:31:46.320 --> 02:31:50.400]  it's interesting and he did but he also didn't mention facebook by name
[02:31:50.400 --> 02:31:53.600]  and so it's just sort of funny that it's obvious that
[02:31:53.600 --> 02:31:56.720]  like all these comments about the horrible things that the people are
[02:31:56.720 --> 02:31:59.200]  doing oh that's facebook it does seem like
[02:31:59.200 --> 02:32:02.000]  facebook and apple are going into a cold war
[02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:07.360]  like and it is escalating and yeah they're much more much more at odds
[02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:10.880]  than you know say apple and microsoft yeah or
[02:32:10.880 --> 02:32:14.240]  even apple and google right and i guess you know it probably
[02:32:14.240 --> 02:32:18.880]  helps that google pays 20 billion dollars a year for
[02:32:18.880 --> 02:32:23.760]  default search placement in safari um or at least they do now like i feel
[02:32:23.760 --> 02:32:28.000]  like that is seriously in jeopardy uh regulatory
[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:33.200]  wise going forward um
[02:32:33.200 --> 02:32:36.720]  but and and apple doesn't really have any
[02:32:36.720 --> 02:32:41.120]  sort of real the apple doesn't really benefit from facebook in any way
[02:32:41.120 --> 02:32:44.640]  you know facebook gets a lot more from apple than apple gets from facebook
[02:32:44.640 --> 02:32:49.200]  insofar as that facebook has a lot of customers who are using
[02:32:49.200 --> 02:32:54.560]  iphones um and presumably you know it's still the
[02:32:54.560 --> 02:32:58.080]  case that the average iphone user is a better
[02:32:58.080 --> 02:33:03.360]  demographic advertising wise than the general public um
[02:33:03.360 --> 02:33:07.120]  and so you can see that and facebook you know they even issued it in their in
[02:33:07.120 --> 02:33:10.560]  their results last week they even issued it as
[02:33:10.560 --> 02:33:13.360]  you know like one of their we have to say this this is you know
[02:33:13.360 --> 02:33:18.480]  there's negative headwinds or whatever lingo they use with the ad tracking
[02:33:18.480 --> 02:33:22.000]  change which still has not for all the publicity about it
[02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:26.640]  the ad tracking identifier change in ios 14 which was
[02:33:26.640 --> 02:33:30.160]  apple had originally said was intended to ship with ios 14
[02:33:30.160 --> 02:33:33.280]  in september or october still hasn't shipped
[02:33:33.280 --> 02:33:37.200]  at at because of the resistance to people you know like facebook and google
[02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:40.240]  against it but apple has now said it is coming in
[02:33:40.240 --> 02:33:43.760]  the next version of ios which is probably
[02:33:43.760 --> 02:33:49.760]  uh 14.5 and probably coming in march yeah and they're saying it's going to
[02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:54.000]  cost them money so and now and the other story i saw was uh
[02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:57.200]  that the information had a story that facebook is preparing
[02:33:57.200 --> 02:34:02.320]  an antitrust lawsuit against apple yeah which good luck with that well that's
[02:34:02.320 --> 02:34:05.120]  is is isn't that weird i didn't know that
[02:34:05.120 --> 02:34:09.040]  that i guess i guess one company can sue another company for anything i mean
[02:34:09.040 --> 02:34:12.400]  that's like one of the things my wife who is a lawyer has explained to me
[02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:16.160]  about trump over the years that that you you could sue anybody for
[02:34:16.160 --> 02:34:19.600]  anything like so you know making it seem like it's
[02:34:19.600 --> 02:34:22.640]  news that so-and-so got sued for whatever
[02:34:22.640 --> 02:34:26.560]  it doesn't necessarily mean anything you know it's like calling somebody a
[02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:30.160]  uh booger head doesn't necessarily i mean it's you know it's like
[02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:33.040]  trump's lawsuits over the election right you know they were like they were like
[02:34:33.040 --> 02:34:36.160]  oh for 60 on those
[02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:40.400]  all right didn't really amount to a hill of beans but uh
[02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:43.680]  i you know it's that's i guess that's facebook's
[02:34:43.680 --> 02:34:48.080]  nuclear option i i really don't see facebook as having the case you know
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:50.800]  whatever antitrust concerns there are over
[02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:54.480]  apple's control over the platforms and i know that they're nuanced in many
[02:34:54.480 --> 02:34:58.080]  uh i don't think facebook is on the short end of them you know and i guess
[02:34:58.080 --> 02:35:00.080]  there's certain areas where they would like to
[02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:04.400]  do their own credit card processing and they ran into a little thing but
[02:35:04.400 --> 02:35:07.760]  they certainly don't have as big a complaint as most people have
[02:35:07.760 --> 02:35:13.520]  you know who are who would like to do their own credit card processing
[02:35:13.520 --> 02:35:17.680]  well it'd be interesting to see how it goes so is the tim cook video worth
[02:35:17.680 --> 02:35:22.080]  watching i didn't see oh yeah i read the the on
[02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:25.120]  six colors they have the um text of his comments so i read the
[02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:28.800]  comments yeah uh and i yeah and i also saw the not
[02:35:28.800 --> 02:35:31.840]  that i don't like looking at tim i mean he's a handsome man yeah but i did see
[02:35:31.840 --> 02:35:35.200]  though when i read his remarks the other thing it wasn't just about privacy
[02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:39.040]  though if the the the the particular facebook
[02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:43.840]  part was about him saying that the algorithmic driven
[02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:50.000]  yeah social media that promotes inflammatory material because it is
[02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:56.320]  addictive is a danger to society which is and he didn't say anything specific
[02:35:56.320 --> 02:35:59.680]  but he's you know he talked about recent events
[02:35:59.680 --> 02:36:03.840]  i did see also that i haven't watched it either i and again it's six days old so
[02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:07.920]  i probably ought to watch it before the next one but i did see that he was on
[02:36:07.920 --> 02:36:12.080]  fox news sunday last week to talk about apple's decision to remove parlor from
[02:36:12.080 --> 02:36:16.160]  the app store uh the that's the show hosted by uh
[02:36:16.160 --> 02:36:21.200]  chris wallace which is like the you know so he's on fox news but it's
[02:36:21.200 --> 02:36:26.160]  like the sane part of fox news right um but i've
[02:36:26.160 --> 02:36:29.120]  heard that it's good and you know and it's you know you can
[02:36:29.120 --> 02:36:33.520]  see why he's on fox to talk about that but
[02:36:33.520 --> 02:36:39.120]  uh but we shall see let me thank our sponsors our sponsors this week oh man
[02:36:39.120 --> 02:36:41.680]  three great sponsors he really came on on a
