[00:00.000 --> 00:22.280]  Well, just like last year,
[00:22.280 --> 00:27.400]  we have a cavalcade of special guests for this episode lining up.
[00:27.400 --> 00:30.600]  They will come on in a series of entrances.
[00:30.600 --> 00:36.120]  Last year, we ended up going overtime and John Siracusa did not make it onto the show.
[00:36.120 --> 00:39.320]  So he's lined up, he's ready to go.
[00:39.320 --> 00:40.840]  We'll try to get him on.
[00:40.840 --> 00:47.160]  We've also got Ben Thompson and Marco Arment lined up.
[00:47.160 --> 00:50.080]  Right now though, it's just me and Guy English.
[00:50.080 --> 00:52.200]  Yeah. I'm a huge fan of Ben Arment.
[00:52.200 --> 00:54.640]  He's amazing.
[00:54.640 --> 00:56.760]  Am I allowed to talk?
[00:56.760 --> 01:03.240]  And my wife, Amy Gruber, is here to talk about Star Wars The Force Awakens.
[01:03.240 --> 01:06.520]  I don't know what's wrong with people.
[01:06.520 --> 01:12.320]  There are so many people who have already been on like seven podcasts talking about this thing.
[01:12.320 --> 01:15.200]  Have you, Guy? Have you talked about this on a podcast yet?
[01:15.200 --> 01:16.720]  I have not, no.
[01:16.720 --> 01:19.200]  That was my fifth one.
[01:19.200 --> 01:19.880]  I guess.
[01:19.880 --> 01:22.280]  No, I haven't actually.
[01:22.280 --> 01:28.120]  I've wanted to because it turns out I like this movie.
[01:28.120 --> 01:32.800]  I'm so excited to talk about it because, you know, everybody is so anti-spoiler.
[01:32.800 --> 01:36.360]  So I've just really been ranting at my family about it.
[01:36.360 --> 01:38.760]  Well, Twitter's one thing, right?
[01:38.760 --> 01:39.960]  Like don't spoil it on Twitter.
[01:39.960 --> 01:43.280]  But I mean, if you're going to listen to a podcast, you know.
[01:43.280 --> 01:50.440]  Right. So let's just get it out of the way though that this podcast is going to be incredibly spoiler-tastic.
[01:50.440 --> 01:56.480]  So if you haven't seen it yet and you don't want it spoiled, hit pause in your podcast player.
[01:56.480 --> 02:03.200]  Go down to your local multiplex, see the movie, and then when you come out, hit unpause.
[02:03.200 --> 02:08.480]  And honestly, get your IQ tested because it's called the Star Wars Christmas Spectacular.
[02:08.480 --> 02:14.880]  And if you're not expecting spoilers, you might be stupid.
[02:14.880 --> 02:18.560]  So first things first, here's my question for both of you.
[02:18.560 --> 02:23.800]  I don't know who wants to answer first, but did you like the movie?
[02:23.800 --> 02:24.320]  No.
[02:24.320 --> 02:25.280]  Amy?
[02:25.280 --> 02:25.920]  No, I didn't.
[02:25.920 --> 02:27.520]  Amy, you didn't like the movie.
[02:27.520 --> 02:31.360]  No, I had some real problems.
[02:31.360 --> 02:33.000]  I know.
[02:33.000 --> 02:35.800]  That's right. I have talked to you about it.
[02:35.800 --> 02:38.480]  Yeah, I felt bad. I felt like I made you sad.
[02:38.480 --> 02:42.360]  Yeah, yeah. Like, I was loving it.
[02:42.360 --> 02:44.720]  I was absolutely loving it.
[02:44.720 --> 02:47.600]  And I was like, wow, I'm actually going to go see this again tomorrow.
[02:47.600 --> 02:51.640]  Like, I was super, super into it, but I had no idea what was going to happen.
[02:51.640 --> 02:55.280]  And I had given it absolutely no thought what was going to happen.
[02:55.280 --> 03:01.520]  And then when it happened, I got so sad that I cried in the movie theater.
[03:01.520 --> 03:02.880]  Yeah.
[03:02.880 --> 03:05.880]  But how did you like the film?
[03:05.880 --> 03:07.080]  I thought it was a good film.
[03:07.080 --> 03:08.560]  I loved it.
[03:08.560 --> 03:13.200]  I mean, OK, there's some flaws as a movie.
[03:13.200 --> 03:19.560]  But as a modern myth retold, I love it.
[03:19.560 --> 03:20.800]  And I think it's great.
[03:20.800 --> 03:21.600]  I loved it.
[03:21.600 --> 03:24.480]  I don't think that that outcome that you're talking about could have gone any other way.
[03:24.480 --> 03:25.640]  I think it had to happen.
[03:25.640 --> 03:26.320]  No!
[03:26.320 --> 03:29.880]  I've been expecting it to happen since 1983, to be honest.
[03:29.880 --> 03:32.880]  Like...
[03:32.880 --> 03:35.240]  I'm going to get angry.
[03:35.240 --> 03:36.840]  You can get angry.
[03:36.840 --> 03:37.960]  You're in a safe space.
[03:37.960 --> 03:39.920]  So to be clear, let's just get it over with.
[03:39.920 --> 03:43.280]  What we're talking about is when Han Solo died.
[03:43.280 --> 03:48.480]  And it was a turning point for Amy in the movie.
[03:48.480 --> 03:51.600]  Do you guys have drinks?
[03:51.600 --> 03:53.560]  Maybe don't have a drink.
[03:53.560 --> 03:55.160]  I don't know.
[03:55.160 --> 03:56.040]  I don't know.
[03:56.040 --> 03:57.120]  You know what?
[03:57.120 --> 04:02.240]  I got day drunk the next day because I woke up and I was like, why am I so sad?
[04:02.240 --> 04:04.800]  And then I remembered why I was so sad.
[04:04.800 --> 04:06.840]  And it was terrible.
[04:06.840 --> 04:08.080]  Oh, that's beautiful.
[04:08.080 --> 04:09.080]  I was so sad.
[04:09.080 --> 04:14.840]  And everybody, like everybody around me was so excited and like Jonas was loving the movie.
[04:14.840 --> 04:16.200]  And Jonas is stupid.
[04:16.200 --> 04:16.800]  He turned to me.
[04:16.800 --> 04:18.400]  He's like, he's not really dead.
[04:18.400 --> 04:20.400]  And I was like, no, he's so dead.
[04:20.400 --> 04:24.880]  Like he got stabbed and then he fell off a dangerous catwalk and then he got blown up.
[04:24.880 --> 04:27.440]  They like itchy and scratchy killed him, right?
[04:27.440 --> 04:29.320]  Like Wile E. Coyote.
[04:29.320 --> 04:32.160]  Like, yeah, like he couldn't have been more dead.
[04:32.160 --> 04:37.280]  Like they did not leave any avenues open for him to not be dead.
[04:37.280 --> 04:43.920]  Lightsaber through the chest, fell off a catwalk into what looked like some kind of fiery pit.
[04:43.920 --> 04:49.960]  So it was both a fall and some kind of fire reactor driven by the power of a sun.
[04:49.960 --> 04:50.520]  Right.
[04:50.520 --> 04:51.920]  Which then explodes.
[04:51.920 --> 04:55.880]  Like, why don't they stop with these dangerous catwalks?
[04:55.880 --> 04:58.040]  Why don't they have railings?
[04:58.040 --> 04:58.640]  So many.
[04:58.640 --> 04:59.640]  He would still be dead.
[04:59.640 --> 05:01.520]  Amy, he would still be dead.
[05:01.520 --> 05:03.400]  I don't know.
[05:03.400 --> 05:04.400]  They could patch him up.
[05:04.400 --> 05:11.280]  Maybe like if he hadn't fallen, I don't know.
[05:11.280 --> 05:13.440]  I really love your devotion to Han Solo.
[05:13.440 --> 05:14.360]  I think that's awesome.
[05:14.360 --> 05:15.080]  I know.
[05:15.080 --> 05:20.840]  I wanted to be Han Solo growing up and I love the way he went out.
[05:20.840 --> 05:22.560]  No, no, no.
[05:22.560 --> 05:24.320]  The way he went out was so stupid.
[05:24.320 --> 05:26.720]  That stupid wussy kid.
[05:26.720 --> 05:27.800]  That was horrible.
[05:27.800 --> 05:29.160]  His kid was horrible.
[05:29.160 --> 05:33.880]  Like it made me so mad that his kid was so horrible and wussy and such a big baby.
[05:33.880 --> 05:36.160]  And then he gets to kill Han Solo?
[05:36.160 --> 05:36.840]  Like, that's...
[05:36.840 --> 05:38.800]  And I wasn't even invested in this kid.
[05:38.800 --> 05:41.080]  He didn't get to kill Han Solo.
[05:41.080 --> 05:42.080]  He got to...
[05:42.080 --> 05:42.840]  He killed him.
[05:42.840 --> 05:46.400]  Han Solo elected to be killed.
[05:46.400 --> 05:48.680]  That was his choice.
[05:48.680 --> 05:49.360]  Are you kidding me?
[05:49.360 --> 05:50.840]  Kylo Ren is such a weenie.
[05:50.840 --> 05:52.080]  He didn't move off the bridge.
[05:52.080 --> 05:58.120]  Like he stood his ground and walked towards him.
[05:58.120 --> 06:01.280]  So you think that he chose to...
[06:01.280 --> 06:07.080]  Like if he loves this kid so much, he just chose to saddle him with having killed his father?
[06:07.080 --> 06:08.720]  That makes no sense.
[06:08.720 --> 06:10.800]  No, I think he thought...
[06:10.800 --> 06:18.800]  I think that Leia told him, if you see our son, bring him home.
[06:18.800 --> 06:21.400]  So now he's not home and Han Solo's dead.
[06:21.400 --> 06:22.400]  So you think she's happy about that?
[06:22.400 --> 06:26.800]  Well, I think that Han Solo's the kind of guy that he's...
[06:26.800 --> 06:29.400]  I think he's disappointed Leia for the last time.
[06:29.400 --> 06:33.680]  And he's going to try to make sure that that kid gets home.
[06:33.680 --> 06:35.960]  How? He's dead.
[06:35.960 --> 06:37.640]  I'm so angry.
[06:37.640 --> 06:38.360]  He didn't know.
[06:38.360 --> 06:40.760]  He didn't know exactly how the conversation was going to go.
[06:40.760 --> 06:44.680]  But at the end, it was like, well, you can either cut me down in anger.
[06:44.680 --> 06:48.920]  Like me, what, I'm going to pull out my blaster and try to shoot you in the face.
[06:48.920 --> 06:50.440]  Can't do that.
[06:50.440 --> 06:51.480]  I can run away.
[06:51.480 --> 06:52.800]  Can't do that.
[06:52.800 --> 06:57.840]  Or, you know, we can go with this thing where you kill me and I help you.
[06:57.840 --> 07:04.280]  And then at least there's like a glimmer of light in him still.
[07:04.280 --> 07:06.720]  Like, I really hate my dad.
[07:06.720 --> 07:10.320]  He's such a jerk, but he totally helped me turn to the dark side.
[07:10.320 --> 07:15.880]  I can't really make a rational argument for it because I've never been there.
[07:15.880 --> 07:20.320]  But like I said, even if he turns, like even if then he becomes good.
[07:20.320 --> 07:22.080]  I hope we never see his dumb ass again.
[07:22.080 --> 07:23.000]  I hate him.
[07:23.000 --> 07:27.200]  But even if he turns, he's saddled with having killed his father.
[07:27.200 --> 07:31.080]  Like, how do you go home to your mother and say like, hey, I'm done with this dark side
[07:31.080 --> 07:33.520]  crap, but sorry I killed dad.
[07:33.520 --> 07:34.960]  Like, that's not helping.
[07:34.960 --> 07:35.960]  This isn't helping.
[07:35.960 --> 07:36.960]  Like, it's not helping.
[07:36.960 --> 07:38.960]  I don't think he does.
[07:38.960 --> 07:40.120]  I don't think he does.
[07:40.120 --> 07:41.400]  It made no sense.
[07:41.400 --> 07:42.760]  It made absolutely no sense.
[07:42.760 --> 07:46.660]  And who, like, I was loving this movie and I was like, JJ Abrams, like, you could tell
[07:46.660 --> 07:49.560]  he's a fan and he totally got it.
[07:49.560 --> 07:53.200]  And I felt like there were a whole bunch of like corny, like Star Wars type jokes where
[07:53.200 --> 07:55.080]  they're corny, but they're funny.
[07:55.080 --> 08:00.520]  And then he killed Han Solo and I turned I was like, who the fuck does he think he is
[08:00.520 --> 08:01.520]  killing Han Solo?
[08:01.520 --> 08:05.800]  Like, you don't get to just get this and then kill my childhood hero.
[08:05.800 --> 08:07.440]  I was so mad.
[08:07.440 --> 08:11.360]  Oh, I'm getting mad again.
[08:11.360 --> 08:12.360]  It's okay.
[08:12.360 --> 08:13.360]  You can get mad.
[08:13.360 --> 08:14.720]  But well, let's back up.
[08:14.720 --> 08:15.720]  I can take it.
[08:15.720 --> 08:16.720]  I can really take it.
[08:16.720 --> 08:17.720]  Okay.
[08:17.720 --> 08:18.720]  I'm not mad at you.
[08:18.720 --> 08:19.720]  I know.
[08:19.720 --> 08:20.720]  I know.
[08:20.720 --> 08:21.720]  But I don't care if you yell at me.
[08:21.720 --> 08:31.080]  It's an interesting decision, though, and I feel like if there's a spoiler that I knew
[08:31.080 --> 08:38.040]  going into the movie that colored my viewing of it the first time, it's an old spoiler.
[08:38.040 --> 08:43.800]  It's from knowing from when I was a kid in 1983 that in interviews about Return of the
[08:43.800 --> 08:49.960]  Jedi that Harrison Ford publicly said that he had petitioned George Lucas to have Han
[08:49.960 --> 08:55.440]  Solo killed off and that he argued that it would give the movie I think he called it
[08:55.440 --> 09:01.320]  like gravity or something weight, but that it would give like a bittersweet feeling to
[09:01.320 --> 09:06.200]  the end of the movie instead of everybody kumbaya singing with the Ewoks that it would
[09:06.200 --> 09:09.480]  be like, yeah, we beat them and we killed the Emperor.
[09:09.480 --> 09:19.480]  But Han Solo is dead and then it's kind of ugly stuff, but he publicly said that he thinks
[09:19.480 --> 09:22.520]  George Lucas didn't want to do that because it would sell fewer toys that you wouldn't
[09:22.520 --> 09:24.920]  sell a lot of dead Han Solo action figures.
[09:24.920 --> 09:29.640]  Oh, but that's just like hothead young kid just getting fame talk.
[09:29.640 --> 09:30.640]  You know what I mean?
[09:30.640 --> 09:33.200]  Like, no, Harrison Ford is Han Solo.
[09:33.200 --> 09:39.960]  Like there's so much like he I don't think he'll just say what I don't think, though,
[09:39.960 --> 09:45.320]  but I really do think, though, like if Harrison Ford had said to, you know, JJ Abrams and
[09:45.320 --> 09:51.240]  the Disney people, the Lucasfilm people, I'm in it, I, you know, sign me up for three movies,
[09:51.240 --> 09:53.420]  I'll be in all three.
[09:53.420 --> 09:57.120]  I think that they would have, you know, I think they're not stupid.
[09:57.120 --> 10:00.160]  I think they know everybody loves Han Solo, I think they would have put them in all three.
[10:00.160 --> 10:04.960]  I think the fact that he got killed is the fact that it's largely colored, they wrote
[10:04.960 --> 10:09.640]  the story to put that in the story, because Harrison Ford said, All right, I'll do one,
[10:09.640 --> 10:11.560]  and you got to give me a lot of money.
[10:11.560 --> 10:15.920]  And I think it's kind of, it's an interesting thing that it's like the actor's decision
[10:15.920 --> 10:19.320]  to to color the arc of the whole story.
[10:19.320 --> 10:20.800]  Amy,
[10:20.800 --> 10:27.360]  I don't really care what Harrison Ford wants.
[10:27.360 --> 10:31.320]  You've taken on this responsibility, like, and apparently, everyone knew that he was
[10:31.320 --> 10:32.320]  going to die.
[10:32.320 --> 10:33.680]  I did not know he was going to die.
[10:33.680 --> 10:38.480]  I remember that, like in the 80s, that he, you know, but he was all swaggering and like,
[10:38.480 --> 10:41.780]  uh, you know, they should kill me or whatever, and I don't want to do it anymore.
[10:41.780 --> 10:42.780]  But they all said that.
[10:42.780 --> 10:44.600]  And they all came back.
[10:44.600 --> 10:49.360]  I just, I'll never see another JJ Abrams movie again.
[10:49.360 --> 10:50.360]  He killed Han Solo.
[10:50.360 --> 10:55.320]  And I think during the movie, I screamed, why didn't they kill Chewbacca?
[10:55.320 --> 10:56.960]  Because I felt like then you could have-
[10:56.960 --> 10:58.240]  They shot Chewbacca.
[10:58.240 --> 11:00.240]  You cannot shoot.
[11:00.240 --> 11:01.240]  You can't shoot Chewbacca.
[11:01.240 --> 11:06.040]  So seriously, you're fine with Han Solo, but Chewbacca crosses your line.
[11:06.040 --> 11:07.040]  Oh my god.
[11:07.040 --> 11:08.040]  No, no, no, no.
[11:08.040 --> 11:09.040]  No, no, no.
[11:09.040 --> 11:10.720]  What I'm saying is Chewbacca got shot early.
[11:10.720 --> 11:11.960]  Well, I wish he would have done that.
[11:11.960 --> 11:16.040]  And I was like, whoa, that, like the stakes are raised at this point.
[11:16.040 --> 11:18.980]  Like anything's on the table.
[11:18.980 --> 11:23.480]  If they would have killed Chewbacca, they could have killed like a character and then
[11:23.480 --> 11:29.040]  he could have had the, hey, I killed a major Star Wars character and gotten that, but not
[11:29.040 --> 11:30.040]  really somebody.
[11:30.040 --> 11:33.200]  I mean, I'd be like, oh, Chewbacca, but I wouldn't be heartbroken.
[11:33.200 --> 11:37.600]  I wouldn't be day drunk the next day.
[11:37.600 --> 11:42.900]  I will also say, just to be clear and put this on the public record, we went to see
[11:42.900 --> 11:50.320]  the movie on opening night, which was Thursday night, and we already had tickets for a Saturday
[11:50.320 --> 11:51.440]  matinee.
[11:51.440 --> 11:55.120]  So we didn't go back the next day, but because it was a school day, I thought it was enough
[11:55.120 --> 12:00.060]  that we kept the kid up till 1 a.m. watching the movie.
[12:00.060 --> 12:04.040]  But then Saturday afternoon, we had already bought tickets, three tickets.
[12:04.040 --> 12:06.320]  Amy did not attend.
[12:06.320 --> 12:08.080]  She would not see it again.
[12:08.080 --> 12:09.580]  I couldn't watch it again.
[12:09.580 --> 12:10.580]  I couldn't.
[12:10.580 --> 12:11.680]  I really couldn't watch it again.
[12:11.680 --> 12:12.680]  And John was like, come on.
[12:12.680 --> 12:14.320]  And I was like, I'm just too sad.
[12:14.320 --> 12:15.320]  I'm not ready.
[12:15.320 --> 12:18.120]  Like, I think maybe in a week or two, I might be able to go see it again.
[12:18.120 --> 12:21.780]  I would like to see it again, but I'm worried that it'll break my heart again.
[12:21.780 --> 12:23.640]  I mean, I couldn't take it.
[12:23.640 --> 12:26.080]  I really couldn't take it.
[12:26.080 --> 12:28.680]  I love that it affected you that much.
[12:28.680 --> 12:29.680]  It really did.
[12:29.680 --> 12:30.680]  I really do.
[12:30.680 --> 12:31.680]  I was surprised.
[12:31.680 --> 12:32.680]  I don't want you to be sad.
[12:32.680 --> 12:38.040]  You know, I don't want you to be unhappy, but the fact that it hit you is kind of why
[12:38.040 --> 12:39.040]  they did it.
[12:39.040 --> 12:40.040]  Right.
[12:40.040 --> 12:41.040]  That's the...
[12:41.040 --> 12:44.700]  Yeah, but I felt like, okay, like this story is kind of a tangent.
[12:44.700 --> 12:50.080]  But when I was little, you know, the Wizard of Oz used to come on once a year and everybody
[12:50.080 --> 12:51.080]  would watch it.
[12:51.080 --> 12:53.320]  Like it'd be a big event because, you know, you couldn't watch when I was little, you
[12:53.320 --> 12:55.000]  couldn't watch movies over and over again.
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.280]  So you got to see the Wizard of Oz like once a year at Easter.
[12:57.280 --> 12:59.780]  They would show it on TV and it was a big deal.
[12:59.780 --> 13:04.320]  And I just remember like 10, 15 members of my family were watching it and I'm like four
[13:04.320 --> 13:05.320]  years old.
[13:05.320 --> 13:07.760]  And I really liked the bad witch.
[13:07.760 --> 13:10.920]  Oh, there might be a Wizard of Oz spoiler.
[13:10.920 --> 13:11.920]  So if you're sensitive.
[13:11.920 --> 13:13.640]  Oh, yeah, man.
[13:13.640 --> 13:21.060]  But when she melts, everybody in my family was like, yay, you know, ding dong, the witch
[13:21.060 --> 13:22.060]  is dead.
[13:22.060 --> 13:26.040]  And I really loved her and I started to cry.
[13:26.040 --> 13:30.200]  And then they all kind of was they were laughing at me for crying.
[13:30.200 --> 13:31.560]  And I was like, I hate you.
[13:31.560 --> 13:34.720]  Like my mother still reenacts the scene like I was like, I hate you all.
[13:34.720 --> 13:39.320]  You're all dumb, dumb, dumb and I ran away like I was so mad that they were happy that
[13:39.320 --> 13:40.320]  she died.
[13:40.320 --> 13:42.080]  And that's how I felt when Han Solo died.
[13:42.080 --> 13:45.760]  Like people were still in like, after the movie, people were clapping and screaming
[13:45.760 --> 13:48.300]  and I was like, you assholes Han Solo's dead.
[13:48.300 --> 13:50.520]  Like I couldn't even enjoy it.
[13:50.520 --> 13:54.280]  And I couldn't believe anyone liked it and that no one else was as sad as I was like,
[13:54.280 --> 13:56.080]  I really had to like hang my head.
[13:56.080 --> 13:59.080]  I was visibly crying.
[13:59.080 --> 14:00.080]  She really was.
[14:00.080 --> 14:01.860]  She was very upset.
[14:01.860 --> 14:09.040]  But I would I would argue what you said guy that it it just shows that it was it was effective
[14:09.040 --> 14:12.760]  as a as a, you know, a death that actually meant something.
[14:12.760 --> 14:13.760]  Yeah.
[14:13.760 --> 14:16.780]  So I mean, there's two things that things that I like.
[14:16.780 --> 14:27.700]  And then there was things that I think are good, like, you know, well rendered art.
[14:27.700 --> 14:32.000]  I can be offended by something that I feel is well rendered art, or I can be hurt by
[14:32.000 --> 14:33.320]  it emotionally.
[14:33.320 --> 14:39.920]  And I can be incredibly sad that, you know, Han Solo got killed.
[14:39.920 --> 14:44.560]  That doesn't mean that I don't think it's an effective piece, you know, like, so.
[14:44.560 --> 14:47.120]  No, you're right, but I'm like a Neanderthal.
[14:47.120 --> 14:48.440]  I'm capable of one emotion.
[14:48.440 --> 14:49.440]  No, I love it, though.
[14:49.440 --> 14:50.440]  I love it.
[14:50.440 --> 14:54.240]  No, the visceral the visceralness is like exactly why they did it.
[14:54.240 --> 14:55.680]  It's for that reaction.
[14:55.680 --> 14:59.680]  Like it's everybody had I had that I was like, I saw it coming a mile away.
[14:59.680 --> 15:02.960]  And I was like, Oh, God, this is not good.
[15:02.960 --> 15:09.840]  The second time I saw the movie, the woman sitting next to me screamed, and then it was
[15:09.840 --> 15:14.040]  incredibly destroyed for the rest of the movie, like almost distractingly.
[15:14.040 --> 15:16.240]  So like, I wish you'd gotten her number.
[15:16.240 --> 15:17.440]  I'd like to go see it with her.
[15:17.440 --> 15:18.440]  I know.
[15:18.440 --> 15:19.440]  Yeah.
[15:19.440 --> 15:20.440]  It was like,
[15:20.440 --> 15:24.480]  I want to remind me of a friend of mine.
[15:24.480 --> 15:26.880]  All right, let's take a break.
[15:26.880 --> 15:33.140]  And I want to thank our first sponsor for this very special holiday spectacular.
[15:33.140 --> 15:35.520]  And it's our good friends at mail route.
[15:35.520 --> 15:37.000]  Now here's what mail route does.
[15:37.000 --> 15:43.400]  These guys do one thing and one thing only they are email nerds, and they run a service
[15:43.400 --> 15:44.400]  mail route.
[15:44.400 --> 15:45.860]  You don't host your email there.
[15:45.860 --> 15:52.200]  What you do is if you have your own domain, and you host your own email, you set your
[15:52.200 --> 15:57.800]  MX records to point to mail route first, and then your email goes through.
[15:57.800 --> 16:01.600]  It's just a filter just goes through mail route and then immediately gets forwarded
[16:01.600 --> 16:05.320]  on to your regular mail server.
[16:05.320 --> 16:06.580]  What's the advantage of that?
[16:06.580 --> 16:11.520]  Here's the advantage your inbox for all of the email on your entire domain, instantly
[16:11.520 --> 16:22.440]  free of like 99.999% of spam, junk mail, all the garbage, it is tremendously effective.
[16:22.440 --> 16:23.940]  These guys really know what they're doing.
[16:23.940 --> 16:25.480]  It's all they do.
[16:25.480 --> 16:28.540]  And it is incredibly easy.
[16:28.540 --> 16:30.360]  So it's super easy.
[16:30.360 --> 16:36.660]  And the other thing too, because it's so easy to try, because it's not like asking you to
[16:36.660 --> 16:41.600]  move all of your email and copy all your email from wherever it's hosted now to a new server
[16:41.600 --> 16:42.600]  or anything like that.
[16:42.600 --> 16:47.580]  You just keep your existing email and all you do is have it go through mail route first
[16:47.580 --> 16:50.620]  and it just flies right through into your inbox.
[16:50.620 --> 16:53.440]  Could not be easier.
[16:53.440 --> 16:55.820]  And it couldn't be quicker to try.
[16:55.820 --> 16:57.900]  Super easy to try it.
[16:57.900 --> 17:00.100]  They support they've got all sorts of, you know, expert stuff.
[17:00.100 --> 17:01.300]  I don't even know what this stuff means.
[17:01.300 --> 17:07.860]  But they support Active Directory TLS, mail bagging, which honestly sounds a little dirty.
[17:07.860 --> 17:09.980]  But apparently that's a real thing.
[17:09.980 --> 17:14.980]  Outbound relay LDAP, all the good stuff you want with your email.
[17:14.980 --> 17:16.300]  Here's where you go to try it.
[17:16.300 --> 17:23.700]  Go to mail route.net slash TTS, just like just the initials of the show the talk show
[17:23.700 --> 17:27.620]  mail route.net slash TTS.
[17:27.620 --> 17:31.640]  And if you go there with that URL, you get a free trial number one.
[17:31.640 --> 17:36.860]  And then when you do sign up, you get 10% off for the lifetime of your account.
[17:36.860 --> 17:41.540]  So you could stay there for 10 years, save a bundle of money just by going to that URL.
[17:41.540 --> 17:43.580]  So my thanks to mail route.
[17:43.580 --> 17:46.620]  All right, let's start at the beginning.
[17:46.620 --> 17:53.140]  Here's the thing I went in and I couldn't shut up about it.
[17:53.140 --> 17:58.060]  Well, this was the first Star Wars movie that wasn't from 20th Century Fox.
[17:58.060 --> 17:59.060]  Yeah, let's talk about the actual movie.
[17:59.060 --> 18:00.060]  Yeah, right.
[18:00.060 --> 18:03.060]  And instead of the one part, let's talk about the parts I actually enjoyed.
[18:03.060 --> 18:05.140]  Because I did enjoy parts of it.
[18:05.140 --> 18:07.580]  But I think like a lot of people...
[18:07.580 --> 18:10.940]  I feel like they should have just thrown a bunch of money at them so we can get the fanfare.
[18:10.940 --> 18:12.420]  Yeah, I feel like...
[18:12.420 --> 18:14.220]  Use the fanfare.
[18:14.220 --> 18:17.840]  I don't know how they could have done it if they could have just had the sound but not
[18:17.840 --> 18:21.460]  the, you know, obviously it wouldn't say 20th Century Fox.
[18:21.460 --> 18:30.500]  But when I hear any other 20th Century Fox movie, when I hear their fanfare, I immediately
[18:30.500 --> 18:32.340]  think this is going to be a Star Wars movie.
[18:32.340 --> 18:36.640]  I hear the Star Wars coming in after the 20th Century Fox.
[18:36.640 --> 18:41.060]  And so my question going into the movie is what are they going to do?
[18:41.060 --> 18:45.140]  Are they going to put the Disney Magic Kingdom castle thing up?
[18:45.140 --> 18:46.140]  And I don't know.
[18:46.140 --> 18:47.140]  They did nothing.
[18:47.140 --> 18:48.140]  They did.
[18:48.140 --> 18:50.140]  And what they ended up doing is they put nothing at the beginning of the movie and it just
[18:50.140 --> 18:51.140]  started...
[18:51.140 --> 18:58.100]  So the fanfare, the 20th Century Fox fanfare came back because Lucas wanted it in 77.
[18:58.100 --> 19:02.580]  They had retired it and he bought it back because he liked it so much.
[19:02.580 --> 19:03.580]  Right.
[19:03.580 --> 19:08.980]  And Star Wars was supposed to sort of harken back to like the golden era of, you know,
[19:08.980 --> 19:09.980]  serial events.
[19:09.980 --> 19:14.980]  So he resurrected it and it's been more or less stuck ever since.
[19:14.980 --> 19:17.820]  And it just screamed Star Wars to me.
[19:17.820 --> 19:26.980]  Like when you hear that sound and that fanfare and you see the visual, you know, I'm sitting
[19:26.980 --> 19:30.060]  down for a Star Wars movie.
[19:30.060 --> 19:35.340]  Even the bad ones had it.
[19:35.340 --> 19:38.900]  I heard a story once that, and I don't know if it's true, it could be apocryphal, but
[19:38.900 --> 19:45.300]  I heard that John Williams wrote the opening notes of Star Wars, knowing that they would
[19:45.300 --> 19:46.780]  come after that fanfare.
[19:46.780 --> 19:51.320]  And in fact, didn't John Williams re-record the fanfare so they'd have a high fidelity
[19:51.320 --> 19:52.320]  version of it?
[19:52.320 --> 19:58.540]  It was like meant to come after, you know, first the fanfare, then a pause, then the
[19:58.540 --> 20:00.840]  Star Wars thing kicks in.
[20:00.840 --> 20:01.840]  I don't know.
[20:01.840 --> 20:02.840]  I would totally believe that.
[20:02.840 --> 20:03.840]  It's just so perfect.
[20:03.840 --> 20:07.220]  And I'm like, I'm not sure now if it's...
[20:07.220 --> 20:14.100]  Like is it perfect because I loved it so much or, you know, is it actually arranged in such
[20:14.100 --> 20:16.780]  a way that just makes it perfect?
[20:16.780 --> 20:17.780]  I don't know.
[20:17.780 --> 20:20.780]  Either way, silence.
[20:20.780 --> 20:23.620]  That was a little jarring, I guess.
[20:23.620 --> 20:25.100]  But you know, whatever.
[20:25.100 --> 20:26.100]  Something new.
[20:26.100 --> 20:28.680]  I guess it's better than having the Disney castle.
[20:28.680 --> 20:31.980]  That would have really broken my heart.
[20:31.980 --> 20:32.980]  And I like Disney.
[20:32.980 --> 20:34.700]  I like the Disney company.
[20:34.700 --> 20:39.060]  We go to Disney World, I don't know, seven or eight times a year.
[20:39.060 --> 20:41.220]  But it would have been wrong for Star Wars.
[20:41.220 --> 20:42.280]  I was really shocked.
[20:42.280 --> 20:48.960]  I thought there was no way Disney was going to pass up the chance not to throw that castle
[20:48.960 --> 20:52.340]  up there and start making more associations with Disney and Star Wars.
[20:52.340 --> 20:53.340]  I was really surprised.
[20:53.340 --> 20:56.060]  I think Disney is a very, very smart company.
[20:56.060 --> 20:57.060]  I agree.
[20:57.060 --> 20:58.060]  I agree.
[20:58.060 --> 20:59.540]  And they're careful about their branding.
[20:59.540 --> 21:02.740]  And yeah, they let them kill Han Solo.
[21:02.740 --> 21:06.740]  I think, I mean, they've let all the Marvel stuff roll with that Marvel, you know, like
[21:06.740 --> 21:12.820]  the comic book, like the Marvel logo is like comic book pages flipping, right?
[21:12.820 --> 21:16.860]  And it just turns into Marvel.
[21:16.860 --> 21:19.380]  I don't know, maybe JJ didn't have a great idea.
[21:19.380 --> 21:23.720]  But either way, I think they were happy to be like, okay, like, for Marvel, we do the
[21:23.720 --> 21:24.720]  Marvel thing.
[21:24.720 --> 21:29.380]  And for you guys, whatever you want, like, if you don't want the castle, fine, right.
[21:29.380 --> 21:33.620]  And we kind of thought that they might Star Wars theme it like the Pirates of the Caribbean
[21:33.620 --> 21:39.500]  movies, they like kind of theme it to the movie and we thought they might do something
[21:39.500 --> 21:40.500]  corny like that.
[21:40.500 --> 21:41.500]  Yeah.
[21:41.500 --> 21:47.420]  And in Tron, they made it sort of Tron, you know, made like a Tron style castle.
[21:47.420 --> 21:49.180]  But yeah, but this ain't Tron, right?
[21:49.180 --> 21:58.500]  I think what I would have pushed for would be to, I guess you couldn't get Fox to actually
[21:58.500 --> 22:00.020]  use the real Fox music.
[22:00.020 --> 22:03.140]  I don't think there's any way that even like you said, like throwing money at it.
[22:03.140 --> 22:04.140]  I don't know.
[22:04.140 --> 22:05.140]  There's something.
[22:05.140 --> 22:09.540]  But if they could have just made a new fanfare that was very similar, in some way that strikes
[22:09.540 --> 22:15.300]  the same notes, and then play that over the Lucasfilm limited title card.
[22:15.300 --> 22:19.540]  Yeah, yeah, I would.
[22:19.540 --> 22:22.060]  I'd like to think that I don't know who's who's in charge of Fox.
[22:22.060 --> 22:25.060]  I'd like to think that every now and then you can be like, look, this is a cultural
[22:25.060 --> 22:26.060]  imperative.
[22:26.060 --> 22:28.620]  Like, it's not about our companies.
[22:28.620 --> 22:31.620]  Can we just use the music?
[22:31.620 --> 22:39.700]  That's so Canadian to think, well, let's just do a nice thing.
[22:39.700 --> 22:41.700]  I don't think it happens.
[22:41.700 --> 22:53.860]  Anyway, so a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, that was so exciting.
[22:53.860 --> 22:54.860]  It was exciting.
[22:54.860 --> 23:00.520]  But I remember being excited when I saw it for the prequels to I will say I've said this
[23:00.520 --> 23:01.520]  many times before.
[23:01.520 --> 23:02.700]  I'm not a prequel hater.
[23:02.700 --> 23:06.140]  I mean, I don't I don't think they were garbage.
[23:06.140 --> 23:10.380]  But I do remember very much coming out of the first one and being like, wow, that was
[23:10.380 --> 23:12.100]  that was.
[23:12.100 --> 23:13.100]  I feel weird.
[23:13.100 --> 23:17.060]  You know, I feel I feel like I got molested.
[23:17.060 --> 23:20.060]  Yeah.
[23:20.060 --> 23:21.060]  I kept going back.
[23:21.060 --> 23:26.960]  There was a movie center like, like 100 meters from my place at the time.
[23:26.960 --> 23:31.820]  And I just kept going back to be molested over.
[23:31.820 --> 23:38.340]  I think I'm gonna maybe this time I'm gonna like it.
[23:38.340 --> 23:39.780]  That's not good.
[23:39.780 --> 23:41.100]  It's like Star Wars.
[23:41.100 --> 23:44.060]  But yeah, it's like, yeah, it's like, it was so half assed.
[23:44.060 --> 23:49.220]  It was like, it's the people I like, and I'm excited, but it's so, so bad.
[23:49.220 --> 23:51.940]  Yeah, there's some design that I like in it.
[23:51.940 --> 23:56.180]  There are things that I could actually say nice about the the prequels.
[23:56.180 --> 23:59.340]  See, I've like, but they're not good movies from my memory.
[23:59.340 --> 24:02.780]  And all I remember is it was like watching C-SPAN.
[24:02.780 --> 24:04.780]  Like it was just all this political rhetoric.
[24:04.780 --> 24:08.100]  That's all I recall that and Jar Jar.
[24:08.100 --> 24:10.100]  All I remember.
[24:10.100 --> 24:13.420]  What do you drink?
[24:13.420 --> 24:20.620]  So this one starts out and I will say to pretty horrible, but this one, you know what, immediately
[24:20.620 --> 24:23.140]  immediately bang right off the bat.
[24:23.140 --> 24:24.620]  You Skywalker has vanished.
[24:24.620 --> 24:25.620]  Right?
[24:25.620 --> 24:26.620]  That's a great line.
[24:26.620 --> 24:27.620]  There were the stakes.
[24:27.620 --> 24:31.220]  None of this trade negotiation bullshit.
[24:31.220 --> 24:36.180]  It's like, Luke Skywalker, the guy that you love is not here anymore.
[24:36.180 --> 24:41.060]  Like, so clearly a problem, right?
[24:41.060 --> 24:44.460]  Like our hero is gone.
[24:44.460 --> 24:47.820]  I was excited because I hate Luke Skywalker.
[24:47.820 --> 24:49.320]  Well you know, yeah, yeah.
[24:49.320 --> 24:50.320]  You know what I mean?
[24:50.320 --> 24:51.700]  He's like the hero from Jedi.
[24:51.700 --> 24:53.300]  Like he's the guy that, yeah.
[24:53.300 --> 24:57.800]  I've got a lot of strongly held, unpopular, uninformed opinions about Star Wars.
[24:57.800 --> 25:00.900]  So I'm like the perfect guest for the show.
[25:00.900 --> 25:05.140]  No, you're very informed and the strong opinions is the way to go.
[25:05.140 --> 25:06.140]  So I forget.
[25:06.140 --> 25:08.700]  And Luke Skywalker is kind of a whiny jerk.
[25:08.700 --> 25:09.700]  So yeah.
[25:09.700 --> 25:12.900]  I never liked him in the, in the originals.
[25:12.900 --> 25:15.520]  I've just never, I've never cared for him.
[25:15.520 --> 25:19.660]  And ever since I've seen that picture of him, there was a tabloid picture of him and he
[25:19.660 --> 25:25.140]  was outside a gas station and he was digging through the public ashtray and he picked up
[25:25.140 --> 25:27.780]  a butt and smoked it.
[25:27.780 --> 25:29.420]  And I just thought, what are you doing, Markel?
[25:29.420 --> 25:30.420]  That wasn't Luke Skywalker.
[25:30.420 --> 25:31.420]  That was...
[25:31.420 --> 25:39.740]  Well, in my mind, Luke Skywalker, but then he got into like a fancy BMW.
[25:39.740 --> 25:40.740]  Like I don't understand.
[25:40.740 --> 25:43.340]  Like, I just think maybe his wife wanted him to quit smoking.
[25:43.340 --> 25:44.340]  I don't know.
[25:44.340 --> 25:46.780]  You're Luke Skywalker by a pack of cigarettes.
[25:46.780 --> 25:49.700]  It's really, really colored my whole view of Luke Skywalker.
[25:49.700 --> 25:50.700]  All right.
[25:50.700 --> 25:57.580]  I was confused in the opening scene where you've got Poe Dameron and he very, you know,
[25:57.580 --> 26:01.980]  was easily established by the opening text that Prince, or General Leia, I should say,
[26:01.980 --> 26:03.940]  sent her most daring pilot on a mission.
[26:03.940 --> 26:06.940]  It was pretty clear, okay, this guy's the pilot.
[26:06.940 --> 26:10.140]  He's you know, he clearly comes across as a...
[26:10.140 --> 26:11.140]  The scroll nailed it.
[26:11.140 --> 26:12.900]  Like you knew immediately what was going on.
[26:12.900 --> 26:17.820]  But then they said that he went to see like an old ally.
[26:17.820 --> 26:19.180]  And you don't know who it is.
[26:19.180 --> 26:22.260]  And then it's played by Max von Sydow.
[26:22.260 --> 26:25.260]  I had to look it up because I don't even know that his name was mentioned in the movie.
[26:25.260 --> 26:27.900]  But his character's name is Lor San Tekka.
[26:27.900 --> 26:31.340]  Yeah, they should have just called him Max von Sydow.
[26:31.340 --> 26:32.340]  Like, forget it.
[26:32.340 --> 26:33.340]  I was very...
[26:33.340 --> 26:35.340]  It's a Star Wars enough name.
[26:35.340 --> 26:39.260]  I'm intimately familiar with all of the actual movies.
[26:39.260 --> 26:45.540]  And I just expected that it was going to be somebody like Lando or somebody who we knew.
[26:45.540 --> 26:49.960]  And I'm like, all right, he's an old guy, but I don't recognize him.
[26:49.960 --> 26:54.460]  And I really wasted a lot of that scene trying to figure out who he was, because...
[26:54.460 --> 26:55.460]  Me too.
[26:55.460 --> 26:58.300]  And the next scene when he meets Kylo Ren.
[26:58.300 --> 26:59.300]  Yeah.
[26:59.300 --> 27:00.300]  We'll get to that.
[27:00.300 --> 27:03.220]  Well, we'll just talk about that whole opening scene.
[27:03.220 --> 27:08.660]  I really felt like we were supposed to know who he was because they kind of set it up
[27:08.660 --> 27:12.180]  like we were supposed to, and we didn't.
[27:12.180 --> 27:13.700]  And I really did.
[27:13.700 --> 27:16.900]  It was one of the first things I did when I got home is I looked it up and I'm like,
[27:16.900 --> 27:20.100]  okay, I wasn't supposed to know who that guy was, but why did they make me feel stupid?
[27:20.100 --> 27:22.460]  Because I spent a lot of time thinking about it.
[27:22.460 --> 27:26.620]  And I was like, oh, wow, I don't have enough Star Wars knowledge to know who this guy is.
[27:26.620 --> 27:31.140]  And you were two seats away from me, so I couldn't ask you.
[27:31.140 --> 27:34.300]  I don't know if they were trying to make you feel stupid so much as they were just trying
[27:34.300 --> 27:39.700]  to roll into a story.
[27:39.700 --> 27:44.780]  So the scroll for episode four just drops you in the deep end, right?
[27:44.780 --> 27:47.820]  And I think this one does the same thing.
[27:47.820 --> 27:53.060]  And so they say it's an old family friend, but I mean, it's been what, 32 years since
[27:53.060 --> 27:55.020]  the last Star Wars movie.
[27:55.020 --> 27:56.020]  I did want it to be Land Rover.
[27:56.020 --> 28:00.260]  Plenty of time to have an old family friend that we didn't know.
[28:00.260 --> 28:06.940]  But I did, I expected him to be like an Organa or like a Mon Mothma.
[28:06.940 --> 28:07.940]  I don't know.
[28:07.940 --> 28:10.380]  Just somebody who we were supposed to know.
[28:10.380 --> 28:11.380]  Somebody, yeah.
[28:11.380 --> 28:12.380]  You could say, oh my god.
[28:12.380 --> 28:13.380]  Wedge Antilles.
[28:13.380 --> 28:19.820]  Wedge Antilles is an old man, has like the, you know, something, but we don't, whatever,
[28:19.820 --> 28:20.820]  whoever he is.
[28:20.820 --> 28:24.900]  He's the exorcist is who he is.
[28:24.900 --> 28:26.900]  Have you heard this story?
[28:26.900 --> 28:27.900]  Yes.
[28:27.900 --> 28:32.100]  I totally expected Wedge to be in the movie because Wedge is sort of an interesting trivia
[28:32.100 --> 28:36.820]  question because if you ask, you know, who are the characters who were in all three of
[28:36.820 --> 28:42.820]  the, you know, the first Star Wars trilogy, it's, you know, there's Han and Luke and Leia
[28:42.820 --> 28:47.940]  and the droids and Darth Vader and all these ones that are very, you know, all these iconic
[28:47.940 --> 28:51.020]  characters, but the one that's easily overlooked would be Wedge Antilles.
[28:51.020 --> 28:52.600]  And I thought, well, of course they're going to bring him back.
[28:52.600 --> 28:56.620]  And somebody told me, I forget who I was talking to, but somebody said that they approached,
[28:56.620 --> 29:01.900]  the actor's still around, they approached him and he was like, nope, we can't be bothered.
[29:01.900 --> 29:05.140]  Or like maybe he held out for more money or something.
[29:05.140 --> 29:09.900]  That was, uh, I think that was short sighted because he probably could have made a pretty
[29:09.900 --> 29:12.280]  penny on that.
[29:12.280 --> 29:13.680]  It also occurred to me.
[29:13.680 --> 29:19.100]  So he's the guy that, like he made the Death Star run.
[29:19.100 --> 29:23.180]  Like he, I think he actually dropped the, he fired the missiles if I'm, it's been a
[29:23.180 --> 29:25.020]  while since I've seen that one.
[29:25.020 --> 29:26.020]  But he missed.
[29:26.020 --> 29:30.500]  Oh, I think he's the guy that he shot and they impacted on the surface.
[29:30.500 --> 29:31.500]  No, no.
[29:31.500 --> 29:33.300]  That was a, that was a Y-wing pilot, I think.
[29:33.300 --> 29:37.900]  Or no, no, it wasn't X-wing, but it was the, it was like, uh, it was like the squadron
[29:37.900 --> 29:38.900]  captain.
[29:38.900 --> 29:39.900]  Oh, Wedge.
[29:39.900 --> 29:40.900]  Oh, here's the thing.
[29:40.900 --> 29:42.980]  Wedge is Luke's wingman going on the trench run.
[29:42.980 --> 29:43.980]  Right.
[29:43.980 --> 29:44.980]  And then he takes damage.
[29:44.980 --> 29:49.500]  And he basically absorbs a bunch of damage and then gets out of there, you know.
[29:49.500 --> 29:53.420]  In Empire, he's, he is actually the one that topples the AT-AT.
[29:53.420 --> 29:54.420]  Right.
[29:54.420 --> 29:59.260]  And he's the, he's the, the, the, the snowspeeder pilot who's, who.
[29:59.260 --> 30:03.820]  Whose cable works and like he, yeah, he nails it.
[30:03.820 --> 30:09.140]  And he's the one that, uh, on the third Death Star run in Return of the Jedi, he blows up
[30:09.140 --> 30:13.020]  the, um, like, I don't know how to describe it.
[30:13.020 --> 30:17.540]  There's a conduit on the right hand side that he, that he nukes in order so that the, uh,
[30:17.540 --> 30:23.340]  the Falcon can blow up the main bit, you know, like, but he's right there, right to the end.
[30:23.340 --> 30:26.620]  He's been in every major battle that we've seen and he kicks some major ass.
[30:26.620 --> 30:27.620]  Yeah.
[30:27.620 --> 30:31.780]  So I had, I had kind of thought at the bottom of the crawl where it said that Prince, or
[30:31.780 --> 30:35.460]  generally, I'm going to keep saying the first half of the word princess every time I talk
[30:35.460 --> 30:36.460]  about it.
[30:36.460 --> 30:37.460]  That's okay.
[30:37.460 --> 30:39.460]  You're like C-3PO.
[30:39.460 --> 30:40.460]  Exactly.
[30:40.460 --> 30:45.180]  Uh, uh, I, I thought maybe that was who her most daring pilot was.
[30:45.180 --> 30:49.820]  Or I also was sort of hoping maybe it was Han Solo too, you know, until we figured out
[30:49.820 --> 30:51.940]  that it was Poe Dameron.
[30:51.940 --> 30:55.220]  But I figured, you know, wouldn't it be cool if it was Wedge Antilles?
[30:55.220 --> 30:58.580]  Ends up Wedge Antilles, not in the movie.
[30:58.580 --> 31:00.140]  Holding out for more money.
[31:00.140 --> 31:01.140]  So we're still at the crawl.
[31:01.140 --> 31:04.380]  Well, this is the show, this show is going to be fun.
[31:04.380 --> 31:05.380]  We're half an hour in.
[31:05.380 --> 31:07.340]  I mean, I have stuff to do today.
[31:07.340 --> 31:08.340]  Crawl.
[31:08.340 --> 31:11.260]  And how about the opening and the whole opening scene where it's just sort of...
[31:11.260 --> 31:12.260]  Okay, you know what?
[31:12.260 --> 31:13.260]  Okay, let's do this.
[31:13.260 --> 31:15.540]  Uh, loved it.
[31:15.540 --> 31:19.060]  We get a shot of, I have to assume it's a moon.
[31:19.060 --> 31:23.260]  There's two moons orbiting Jakku.
[31:23.260 --> 31:31.580]  We get a Star Destroyer coming in in silhouette, which is nice because if they just played
[31:31.580 --> 31:36.620]  out the same episode four shot, I think that would have been overdone.
[31:36.620 --> 31:41.300]  But the notion that you run the scroll and then you pan down onto planets and the Star
[31:41.300 --> 31:43.860]  Destroyer is like, that's Star Wars lore.
[31:43.860 --> 31:48.940]  That's how you have to start a movie.
[31:48.940 --> 31:56.620]  And then we see Stormtrooper assault ships kind of drop out of the Star Destroyer, which
[31:56.620 --> 32:05.700]  is almost beat for beat identical to what's happening in Star Wars, The New Hope.
[32:05.700 --> 32:06.700]  I hate calling it The New Hope.
[32:06.700 --> 32:08.140]  Yeah, I don't like calling it The New Hope.
[32:08.140 --> 32:09.780]  On this show, we call it Star Wars.
[32:09.780 --> 32:10.780]  Yes.
[32:10.780 --> 32:12.380]  Okay, so let's just establish that.
[32:12.380 --> 32:17.020]  So in Star Wars, that's the same thing, right?
[32:17.020 --> 32:20.940]  There's a crazy Stormtrooper assault and they look badass.
[32:20.940 --> 32:26.260]  Some of them get killed, but they just barge in anyway, and they're unstoppable.
[32:26.260 --> 32:33.580]  And then after they've kind of cleaned up the scene, in Star Wars, Vader walks in and
[32:33.580 --> 32:39.060]  in this one, we have a shuttle deliver Kylo Ren.
[32:39.060 --> 32:42.380]  Yeah, I didn't pick up on it.
[32:42.380 --> 32:47.100]  It took me a while watching it the first time before I picked up on the fact that the whole
[32:47.100 --> 32:55.940]  movie was more or less a remake of Star Wars, either very, very similar or similar, but
[32:55.940 --> 32:58.380]  turned heads to tails.
[32:58.380 --> 33:02.460]  Some people have turned that into a negative, and I don't like that notion.
[33:02.460 --> 33:03.500]  This is a myth.
[33:03.500 --> 33:05.020]  It's a modern myth.
[33:05.020 --> 33:10.660]  Stop worrying about reusing plot points.
[33:10.660 --> 33:16.420]  They set out and they retold the story with a few different characters and a few things
[33:16.420 --> 33:24.100]  mixed up, but they've reset the ground so that it's fertile for the next few movies.
[33:24.100 --> 33:25.100]  You know what I mean?
[33:25.100 --> 33:26.100]  Right.
[33:26.100 --> 33:27.100]  I didn't have any problem with that.
[33:27.100 --> 33:34.500]  Maybe nerds don't want to admit it, but it's kind of like a soap opera.
[33:34.500 --> 33:39.780]  They recycle plots all the time and somebody is going to be somebody's daughter or father
[33:39.780 --> 33:42.220]  and it's just the way it's going to go.
[33:42.220 --> 33:46.060]  I had more problem with Return of the Jedi when they're like, okay, really?
[33:46.060 --> 33:48.300]  Like another Death Star?
[33:48.300 --> 33:50.180]  We kind of did that.
[33:50.180 --> 33:51.180]  Right.
[33:51.180 --> 33:52.180]  Right.
[33:52.180 --> 33:53.180]  Jedi is weaker.
[33:53.180 --> 33:58.180]  This one at least is like, okay, now we're going to do the exact same thing.
[33:58.180 --> 33:59.180]  Maybe I'm older.
[33:59.180 --> 34:04.780]  Well, and I think the other thing, if we're being honest with each other, I didn't predict
[34:04.780 --> 34:05.780]  that.
[34:05.780 --> 34:06.780]  And I did go in blind.
[34:06.780 --> 34:10.580]  I didn't predict that they would just really remake Star Wars.
[34:10.580 --> 34:17.040]  But overall, I think it's kind of genius because they did it without actually remaking it.
[34:17.040 --> 34:22.020]  Now compare and contrast with what they did with Star Trek where they would, and again,
[34:22.020 --> 34:26.860]  J.J. Abrams, they rebooted it, but they've recast all of these iconic characters.
[34:26.860 --> 34:32.300]  There's a new Captain Kirk, there's a new guy playing Spock, and they use the time travel
[34:32.300 --> 34:37.560]  trick to get Leonard Nimoy in to sort of tie it together, but in a way it sort of feels
[34:37.560 --> 34:41.460]  like a cheat because it feels like there's never going to be a William Shatner Kirk in
[34:41.460 --> 34:42.460]  this universe.
[34:42.460 --> 34:46.220]  And I'm so glad that they didn't go that way, that they said, you know, we're not remaking
[34:46.220 --> 34:49.860]  episode 456.
[34:49.860 --> 34:54.580]  And Han Solo is still Harrison Ford, and Luke Skywalker is still Mark Hamill, and Leia is
[34:54.580 --> 34:59.580]  still Carrie Fisher, but yet we're remaking it.
[34:59.580 --> 35:02.720]  And I feel like the thing we have to be honest with each other, with everybody about, is
[35:02.720 --> 35:12.660]  that those movies, especially the first one, Star Wars, it's dated in a certain way.
[35:12.660 --> 35:17.900]  To tie it with my other favorite movie series with the James Bond movies, as much as I love
[35:17.900 --> 35:23.060]  the Sean Connery Bond movies, there's no way that you could make one of those today with
[35:23.060 --> 35:28.080]  that pacing and that level of production quality.
[35:28.080 --> 35:32.860]  They look old, and the first Star Wars movie looks old and it feels old with the way that
[35:32.860 --> 35:34.100]  it's paced.
[35:34.100 --> 35:40.180]  And so I feel like telling that same story, but doing it with up-to-date production values
[35:40.180 --> 35:49.460]  and pacing is sort of necessary to take the franchise out of cold storage.
[35:49.460 --> 35:58.660]  I think so, I think there's so much of this movie that is as much on the meta level as
[35:58.660 --> 36:04.700]  it is actually on the level of telling a story.
[36:04.700 --> 36:09.980]  Certainly all the mirroring of the characters and the plot points.
[36:09.980 --> 36:16.820]  I didn't think it felt used up, I thought it felt fresh and familiar.
[36:16.820 --> 36:19.300]  I don't know, I really liked it, I had no issue with that.
[36:19.300 --> 36:24.980]  I was surprised that so many people did have an issue with that.
[36:24.980 --> 36:25.980]  I think they're off-base.
[36:25.980 --> 36:26.980]  Yeah, exactly.
[36:26.980 --> 36:30.220]  I think people that could complain.
[36:30.220 --> 36:32.940]  Here's a broad topic.
[36:32.940 --> 36:37.140]  From the opening scene, I thought Kylo Ren was an excellent villain, and I liked the
[36:37.140 --> 36:40.980]  way he talked, I liked the words that he chose.
[36:40.980 --> 36:43.780]  Very few words, but he chose them very well.
[36:43.780 --> 36:51.100]  I love this new trick that he introduced where he stopped a laser bolt in mid-air.
[36:51.100 --> 36:57.340]  That had never occurred to me, I thought it was an excellent thing.
[36:57.340 --> 37:02.340]  As the movie goes on, so we're introduced to him, and he feels like a total legit badass.
[37:02.340 --> 37:05.420]  Exactly like Darth Vader in the first movie when he first enters.
[37:05.420 --> 37:12.460]  But then as the movie goes on, to me, once he took his helmet off, I really hate to say
[37:12.460 --> 37:19.500]  it, but I feel like when he took his helmet off, it reminds me vaguely of, what was his
[37:19.500 --> 37:20.500]  name?
[37:20.500 --> 37:21.900]  Dark Helmet in the Spaceballs?
[37:21.900 --> 37:28.220]  Yeah, it's Dark Helmet.
[37:28.220 --> 37:35.620]  Helmet-less Kylo Ren is so whiny, and he's ineffective.
[37:35.620 --> 37:39.020]  It really does correspond to the moment when he takes the helmet off.
[37:39.020 --> 37:41.700]  Is that when he started having the tantrums?
[37:41.700 --> 37:44.060]  No, he'd been having tantrums before.
[37:44.060 --> 37:48.740]  Yeah, that's right, he had his first tantrum, and I think his first tantrum was when I was
[37:48.740 --> 37:50.740]  like, this is a silly person.
[37:50.740 --> 37:53.380]  I agree.
[37:53.380 --> 37:57.860]  I think he was weak and pathetic before he took the helmet off.
[37:57.860 --> 38:08.860]  My read was that he'd captured Rey, Rey was in restraints, and then she sort of questions
[38:08.860 --> 38:13.660]  him by saying, like, I forget what it was, like, you try to kill me?
[38:13.660 --> 38:16.900]  Well, that's what happens when I'm chased by a monster in a mask.
[38:16.900 --> 38:20.140]  And he tries to take the mask off.
[38:20.140 --> 38:22.500]  And I think he thinks it's a power move.
[38:22.500 --> 38:25.180]  And it totally backfires.
[38:25.180 --> 38:33.900]  And the fact that he thinks it's a power move is where I think it turns awesome.
[38:33.900 --> 38:36.340]  Darth Vader gets mad and he kills somebody.
[38:36.340 --> 38:37.340]  You know what I mean?
[38:37.340 --> 38:39.380]  He's frustrated, he's gonna choke somebody.
[38:39.380 --> 38:42.820]  And this guy is just like breaking his lightsaber over his knee.
[38:42.820 --> 38:44.860]  Darth Vader keeps his shit together.
[38:44.860 --> 38:45.860]  I'm sorry.
[38:45.860 --> 38:46.860]  Like he really does.
[38:46.860 --> 38:50.380]  All of the Sith guys that we've seen, even in the shitty movies, keep their shit together.
[38:50.380 --> 38:54.300]  They're like, if you fuck up, I will kill you.
[38:54.300 --> 38:56.860]  Like, make no mistake about it.
[38:56.860 --> 39:04.820]  But if things, if you do what I tell you to do, and things don't go well, I'm fine.
[39:04.820 --> 39:10.020]  Like, I'm gonna be very, very angry, but it's not your fault, and I'm gonna move on.
[39:10.020 --> 39:13.380]  This guy is like, I'm gonna beat up a computer.
[39:13.380 --> 39:14.900]  Like, really?
[39:14.900 --> 39:16.820]  This is your move?
[39:16.820 --> 39:22.300]  There was a time, I was probably right around Jonas's age, maybe like 8, 9, 10 years old.
[39:22.300 --> 39:27.780]  And my family had played a game of Monopoly, which if you know, I think everybody's familiar
[39:27.780 --> 39:28.780]  with.
[39:28.780 --> 39:29.780]  It takes a long time.
[39:29.780 --> 39:37.620]  And, you know, well over an hour into it, and I was the first one to go bankrupt.
[39:37.620 --> 39:42.180]  And I thought for sure that I was going to win because I just thought, you know, my family
[39:42.180 --> 39:45.980]  is full of simpletons.
[39:45.980 --> 39:47.340]  It's good that you're sharing with us.
[39:47.340 --> 39:51.300]  Well, as a 10 year old, you know, I really thought that I, you know, and that the smartest
[39:51.300 --> 39:52.300]  person in the room.
[39:52.300 --> 39:53.300]  Yeah.
[39:53.300 --> 39:56.500]  And I was gonna, you know, wheel and deal and Donald Trump my way into victory, you
[39:56.500 --> 39:57.960]  know, is a real estate magnet.
[39:57.960 --> 40:01.660]  And I went bankrupt, magnate.
[40:01.660 --> 40:07.020]  And I, I lost I was the first one out and I went into a fit.
[40:07.020 --> 40:12.900]  And I we were playing in the kitchen on the kitchen table and I went into the living room,
[40:12.900 --> 40:17.940]  which is next door picked a pillow off the sofa and threw it into the kitchen and it
[40:17.940 --> 40:19.800]  was it could not have been worse.
[40:19.800 --> 40:21.740]  It just swept the board.
[40:21.740 --> 40:24.820]  It swept everything off the board, everybody's money.
[40:24.820 --> 40:29.620]  It just slid across the board, like one of the Dukes of Hazzard sliding across the general
[40:29.620 --> 40:31.600]  league.
[40:31.600 --> 40:35.220]  And I instantly knew, wow, that was a horrible mistake.
[40:35.220 --> 40:37.460]  I just ruined the game for everybody.
[40:37.460 --> 40:39.620]  Like it was completely irrecoverable.
[40:39.620 --> 40:41.460]  And everybody was like, Well, I guess the game's over.
[40:41.460 --> 40:42.660]  Nice job, john.
[40:42.660 --> 40:46.900]  But I was 10 years old, you know, and I learned a lesson from it.
[40:46.900 --> 40:49.180]  I was like, wow, you know, you gotta, you know, I
[40:49.180 --> 40:50.180]  never do stuff like that.
[40:50.180 --> 40:53.980]  I mean that I know that sounds like because I'm like never serious, but you don't you're
[40:53.980 --> 40:56.440]  very, even tempered.
[40:56.440 --> 41:00.820]  I just feel like it's I mean, it's obviously a deliberate choice.
[41:00.820 --> 41:02.140]  It's not like they made a mistake.
[41:02.140 --> 41:07.540]  But it's a curious choice that they've made the main bad guy, somebody who has the emotional
[41:07.540 --> 41:10.580]  temperament of a 10 or 11 year old.
[41:10.580 --> 41:15.460]  Well, I think it needs to to in order to disassociate him with Darth Vader,
[41:15.460 --> 41:21.340]  but it makes him so unlikeable in a way that you have no respect for him.
[41:21.340 --> 41:22.900]  Like Darth Vader was not likable.
[41:22.900 --> 41:27.180]  Like he was likable as a badass, but you know, not really likable.
[41:27.180 --> 41:30.620]  But this guy, that's, that's why it made me so mad when he killed Han Solo.
[41:30.620 --> 41:32.420]  Like I'm gonna stop bringing that up.
[41:32.420 --> 41:37.540]  But because he was just so unlikeable, like he was not worthy of killing Han Solo.
[41:37.540 --> 41:39.660]  I think that's what really got to me.
[41:39.660 --> 41:40.660]  I think that's the point.
[41:40.660 --> 41:41.660]  I know.
[41:41.660 --> 41:42.660]  I know.
[41:42.660 --> 41:43.660]  That's the point.
[41:43.660 --> 41:45.860]  But I just, I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.
[41:45.860 --> 41:48.100]  Well forget the Han Solo bit.
[41:48.100 --> 41:55.380]  I think that, I think that Darth Vader established an archetype for villains that we've seen
[41:55.380 --> 42:00.460]  played over, you know, since its introduction.
[42:00.460 --> 42:03.620]  And this is like, they can't do the same thing.
[42:03.620 --> 42:04.620]  What are you gonna do?
[42:04.620 --> 42:07.060]  Be a better Vader than Vader?
[42:07.060 --> 42:08.060]  Can't do that.
[42:08.060 --> 42:10.500]  So they need they need a petulant child.
[42:10.500 --> 42:20.260]  I mean, that seems like a pretty, like a petulant, overly entitled, vaguely misogynistic, like
[42:20.260 --> 42:21.260]  certainly self-entitled.
[42:21.260 --> 42:23.620]  Well, they nailed it.
[42:23.620 --> 42:24.620]  Child.
[42:24.620 --> 42:25.620]  Yeah.
[42:25.620 --> 42:30.940]  To be, you know, to be the villain, because they've already got the cold calculating guy.
[42:30.940 --> 42:35.220]  I don't know if Vader's cold and calculating, seething.
[42:35.220 --> 42:38.220]  They've got the seething thing done.
[42:38.220 --> 42:40.980]  You can't seethe better than Vader.
[42:40.980 --> 42:43.020]  Like his breathing is seething.
[42:43.020 --> 42:48.800]  Like you literally can't get more than that, you know.
[42:48.800 --> 42:51.860]  So they've got this guy who's a whiny wannabe.
[42:51.860 --> 42:57.700]  And that, it makes sense in the universe and it makes sense as a villain and it's, and
[42:57.700 --> 42:58.700]  it's pathetic.
[42:58.700 --> 43:06.260]  And I like that you don't need to respect.
[43:06.260 --> 43:09.260]  I like that he doesn't deserve to respect.
[43:09.260 --> 43:14.420]  And that's his problem, is that he feels that he does, but it's immediately apparent to
[43:14.420 --> 43:19.580]  anybody that watches him that like, no, you don't, you're no Vader kid.
[43:19.580 --> 43:20.580]  Right.
[43:20.580 --> 43:26.660]  Well, and maybe it's an evolution because I hated Anakin too, in the, you know, the
[43:26.660 --> 43:27.660]  other ones.
[43:27.660 --> 43:28.660]  Yeah.
[43:28.660 --> 43:34.100]  So, you know, maybe, I don't know, maybe killing Han Solo gives him the, you know what, I'm
[43:34.100 --> 43:35.100]  a badass.
[43:35.100 --> 43:36.100]  I killed my dad.
[43:36.100 --> 43:37.100]  I killed Han Solo.
[43:37.100 --> 43:38.740]  So maybe, you know, maybe it's an evolution.
[43:38.740 --> 43:39.740]  I don't know.
[43:39.740 --> 43:42.700]  I think it, I think that kind of maybe, I don't know if it backfired in terms of turning
[43:42.700 --> 43:48.660]  him to the light side, but he was certainly not thinking with his head when he engaged
[43:48.660 --> 43:52.620]  Rey and Finn in that lightsaber battle.
[43:52.620 --> 43:54.180]  Oh, definitely.
[43:54.180 --> 43:55.180]  Definitely.
[43:55.180 --> 43:57.900]  Anyway, so we're jumping all over the place.
[43:57.900 --> 44:00.500]  Yeah, but that, but I feel like, it's just a kind of conversation.
[44:00.500 --> 44:01.500]  I mean, yeah.
[44:01.500 --> 44:06.460]  The other thing they do is in the opening scene, we are instantly, and again, it parallels
[44:06.460 --> 44:12.100]  the first movie where Princess Leia, you know, put the plans in R2-D2 and we've got a new
[44:12.100 --> 44:13.100]  R2-D2 BB-8.
[44:13.100 --> 44:19.060]  And it's, you know, it could not be more, I almost feel like I should have realized
[44:19.060 --> 44:20.060]  they're remaking the movie.
[44:20.060 --> 44:23.980]  I just thought, oh, it's just one note, you know, similar to their secret plans and they're
[44:23.980 --> 44:30.940]  giving them to this astromech droid who beeps and emotes instead of like a nod in the beginning.
[44:30.940 --> 44:34.460]  Like it just felt like a nod to the first movie rather than.
[44:34.460 --> 44:40.980]  I love BB-8 and I feel like, and I know, you know, that was a character that they let out
[44:40.980 --> 44:45.220]  in the trailers and they started making toys and stuff like that for it.
[44:45.220 --> 44:50.500]  So you got the gist of, you know, like the way that he sort of built like a snowman.
[44:50.500 --> 44:54.660]  But I really liked him in the movie and I feel like that one of the things that to me
[44:54.660 --> 45:01.260]  was just a home run in the movie is the BB-8 character.
[45:01.260 --> 45:02.260]  What do you guys think?
[45:02.260 --> 45:08.460]  I don't, I don't think he could have done better.
[45:08.460 --> 45:16.860]  A droid like 3PO would be a failure, and you can't have another R2 unit.
[45:16.860 --> 45:17.900]  We've seen that.
[45:17.900 --> 45:28.220]  We had R4 in the prequels, who nobody cared about, not even Obi-Wan Kenobi, literally
[45:28.220 --> 45:31.460]  nobody cared about that guy.
[45:31.460 --> 45:33.140]  So yeah, no, I loved it.
[45:33.140 --> 45:40.780]  I thought that they managed to make a real genuine new character droid that we actually
[45:40.780 --> 45:43.780]  liked.
[45:43.780 --> 45:45.220]  That's no small feat, right?
[45:45.220 --> 45:49.740]  But he was such an R2-D2, I mean, he's like plucky.
[45:49.740 --> 45:55.900]  He's cuter and he's more mobile and, you know, like he hides behind people's legs.
[45:55.900 --> 46:04.020]  He's got R2-D2 expresses his personality in terms of beeps and boops, and BB-8 does it
[46:04.020 --> 46:05.020]  with like...
[46:05.020 --> 46:10.980]  Yeah, he's kind of like a playful puppy, you know, he had like, like you said, like hiding
[46:10.980 --> 46:12.700]  between the legs and yeah.
[46:12.700 --> 46:17.700]  Yeah, he's more like a pet than R2-D2, I had never got the sense that R2-D2 was a pet.
[46:17.700 --> 46:22.820]  I always got the sense that R2, even in the first movie where we see him, or even if you
[46:22.820 --> 46:28.460]  go back to the prequels, even in the prequels when, you know, chronologically we first see
[46:28.460 --> 46:34.420]  R2, he already feels like he's an old droid, and he sort of acts like an old droid, whereas
[46:34.420 --> 46:38.300]  BB-8 feels like almost childish.
[46:38.300 --> 46:44.180]  Yes, he's got like a sense of wonder about him.
[46:44.180 --> 46:48.300]  One of the biggest laughs in the movie, and I really do love it, I think it's so great,
[46:48.300 --> 46:53.940]  is where, again, we're skipping around, but when they're on the Falcon and Rey is underneath
[46:53.940 --> 47:00.900]  trying to fix the ship, and Finn is explaining that I'm not really part of the Resistance,
[47:00.900 --> 47:04.380]  but there's no way we're getting out of this unless you tell us where.
[47:04.380 --> 47:06.540]  He's coming clean to the droid.
[47:06.540 --> 47:07.540]  Right.
[47:07.540 --> 47:14.700]  And he gives him a thumbs up, and BB-8 has like a butane lighter and uses it to give
[47:14.700 --> 47:15.940]  him a thumbs up.
[47:15.940 --> 47:20.060]  I was ready for it the second time we saw it, and I really gauged the crowd.
[47:20.060 --> 47:24.540]  The crowd absolutely lost it at that point, and I feel like that was really the point
[47:24.540 --> 47:30.300]  where everybody in the theater was like, all right, I am fully on board with this movie.
[47:30.300 --> 47:31.300]  Yeah.
[47:31.300 --> 47:32.300]  I think so, too.
[47:32.300 --> 47:35.900]  That's certainly the biggest laugh.
[47:35.900 --> 47:42.020]  What about in broad strokes?
[47:42.020 --> 47:49.040]  I almost feel like, just to jump to a problem with the movie, is that in the first Star
[47:49.040 --> 47:55.820]  Wars, the famous opening shot where you see the rebel ship, small rebel ship going away,
[47:55.820 --> 48:02.240]  and then the giant, wow, it just keeps going and going and going, giant star destroyer.
[48:02.240 --> 48:07.020]  In addition to just being a beautiful shot and a tremendously effective special effect,
[48:07.020 --> 48:13.260]  it also instantly establishes the power dynamics between the rebellion and the empire, that
[48:13.260 --> 48:20.420]  the rebels are small and really up against it, and the empire is huge and the overwhelming
[48:20.420 --> 48:24.360]  military strength in the galaxy.
[48:24.360 --> 48:30.520]  The shot establishes that, whereas in this movie, it's very unclear to me, even after
[48:30.520 --> 48:36.620]  having watched it twice and read the internet and unspoiled myself, it's very unclear to
[48:36.620 --> 48:46.820]  me how strong the First Order is, and how strong the New Republic and this resistance
[48:46.820 --> 48:47.820]  are.
[48:47.820 --> 48:54.720]  Yeah, I don't think you can tell.
[48:54.720 --> 49:03.700]  They blot out, so the silhouette of the Star Destroyer blots out a moon, rather than the
[49:03.700 --> 49:04.700]  sun.
[49:04.700 --> 49:06.980]  You'd think that would be more of a, you know what I mean?
[49:06.980 --> 49:11.580]  Like if you've got a planet and a sun and a Star Destroyer just kind of comes in between
[49:11.580 --> 49:19.600]  them.
[49:19.600 --> 49:25.700]  The opening crawl did not explain the political situation very well, and none of the expository
[49:25.700 --> 49:28.300]  dialogue really did.
[49:28.300 --> 49:39.420]  If anything, I think that might have been a reaction to the prequels, where all we did
[49:39.420 --> 49:46.900]  is spend time talking about who's voting on what from where, and like, oh wait, that senator
[49:46.900 --> 49:53.220]  needs some farm subsidies so that we can have these stormtroopers, whatever it was.
[49:53.220 --> 49:57.100]  I think maybe that it got glossed over a little bit much.
[49:57.100 --> 50:03.000]  I do know that there have been scenes cut that deal a little bit more with the political
[50:03.000 --> 50:04.000]  side of things.
[50:04.000 --> 50:09.500]  Yeah, I've heard that too, including the characters who got blown up on the balcony.
[50:09.500 --> 50:15.000]  Yeah, we see a woman, like the close-up of the woman's face, she actually apparently
[50:15.000 --> 50:23.860]  gets dispatched by Leia to go and talk to the Galactic Senate about ginning up more
[50:23.860 --> 50:26.860]  support for the Resistance.
[50:26.860 --> 50:29.740]  But I think it all got cut, and probably rightfully so.
[50:29.740 --> 50:34.260]  It was a long enough movie with enough going on that I don't think we needed to know it.
[50:34.260 --> 50:36.660]  Right, let's not listen from those prequels.
[50:36.660 --> 50:42.220]  I mean, if I would have heard the words Galactic Senate, I would have gotten up and left.
[50:42.220 --> 50:45.140]  Ugh, you would have missed Han Solo getting killed.
[50:45.140 --> 50:49.900]  Yeah, and you know what, then I'd be happy.
[50:49.900 --> 50:56.220]  One of the things that I thought was pretty clever, and I liked it, is even though it's
[50:56.220 --> 51:03.180]  thirty years later, and I like the basic idea that what happened in Return of the Jedi did
[51:03.180 --> 51:11.180]  not completely shut down the Empire instantly, that the Empire truly was an Empire, and losing
[51:11.180 --> 51:19.180]  another Death Star and a Super Star Destroyer, and losing the Emperor and Vader, obviously
[51:19.180 --> 51:23.100]  set them back tremendously, but it left them with something that they could still have.
[51:23.100 --> 51:25.180]  They still had this massive Starfleet.
[51:25.180 --> 51:34.140]  Yeah, it just makes sense, there's no way that battle could cripple something as large
[51:34.140 --> 51:35.620]  as a Galactic Empire.
[51:35.620 --> 51:41.260]  I really like the way that they flipped this, though, and they made, because it was unclear
[51:41.260 --> 51:47.020]  how old Darth Vader was in the first movies, but you knew, Obi-Wan said that he was, he
[51:47.020 --> 51:51.740]  told Luke that he had fought with him and that he was a star pilot, so you knew he had
[51:51.740 --> 51:58.160]  to be at least forty or fifty, and that he was more or less twenty years, maybe, or so
[51:58.160 --> 52:00.580]  younger than Obi-Wan.
[52:00.580 --> 52:02.580]  But Tarkin was clearly an old guy.
[52:02.580 --> 52:06.900]  Wait, from those first movies, I did not think he was twenty years younger than Obi-Wan.
[52:06.900 --> 52:07.900]  Oh, you didn't?
[52:07.900 --> 52:08.900]  How old did you think he was?
[52:08.900 --> 52:09.900]  Because he said that he trained him.
[52:09.900 --> 52:10.900]  I thought he was the same age.
[52:10.900 --> 52:14.380]  Oh, see, I thought that he was a little younger, because he told Luke that it was an apprentice
[52:14.380 --> 52:15.380]  of mine.
[52:15.380 --> 52:23.260]  Well, okay, so in A New Hope, he says that he fought with him, so that established my
[52:23.260 --> 52:28.020]  relationship with the thing, and then he talks about Darth Vader having trained him.
[52:28.020 --> 52:30.500]  Yeah, but then he even addresses him as old man.
[52:30.500 --> 52:33.220]  Your powers are weak, old man.
[52:33.220 --> 52:36.020]  Yeah, okay.
[52:36.020 --> 52:38.380]  I still didn't get the twenty years, but okay, yeah.
[52:38.380 --> 52:39.740]  Yeah, I just figured, roughly...
[52:39.740 --> 52:41.740]  Well, yeah, yeah.
[52:41.740 --> 52:42.740]  I don't think you...
[52:42.740 --> 52:46.620]  Yeah, I think you have to have twenty years on somebody to call them an old man.
[52:46.620 --> 52:47.620]  Right.
[52:47.620 --> 52:49.260]  You can't call somebody who's roughly your age an old man.
[52:49.260 --> 52:51.460]  Although I'm gonna start.
[52:51.460 --> 52:55.740]  Old man guy English.
[52:55.740 --> 52:56.740]  I thought...
[52:56.740 --> 52:57.740]  Do it!
[52:57.740 --> 52:58.740]  I'd love that if you just kept calling him an old man.
[52:58.740 --> 52:59.740]  I thought it was...
[52:59.740 --> 53:00.740]  I'd love to go into it.
[53:00.740 --> 53:06.740]  A really interesting twist, especially that the Hux character is like a young...
[53:06.740 --> 53:09.380]  Boy, I wanted to punch that guy.
[53:09.380 --> 53:14.540]  And I feel like they wanted you to want to punch him.
[53:14.540 --> 53:19.900]  When he was giving his little Nazi speech to all the troops, and I was just like, man,
[53:19.900 --> 53:21.460]  I would like to see you get punched.
[53:21.460 --> 53:26.380]  Yeah, you want to grab a Captain America shield and just hit that guy in the face with it.
[53:26.380 --> 53:27.860]  He's awful.
[53:27.860 --> 53:29.420]  Is that where you're going with the token thing?
[53:29.420 --> 53:30.420]  Well, yeah.
[53:30.420 --> 53:31.420]  Because he really...
[53:31.420 --> 53:34.860]  To me, it's one of those aspects of the movie where, yes, the whole thing parallels the
[53:34.860 --> 53:36.580]  first Star Wars movie.
[53:36.580 --> 53:43.100]  Hux is clearly the Tarkin stand-in, and I really like the twist that instead of being
[53:43.100 --> 53:45.100]  an old guy, he is young.
[53:45.100 --> 53:49.300]  I mean, I don't know, he looks to me like he's only around thirty years old.
[53:49.300 --> 53:53.780]  Yeah, he's young, he's full of piss and vinegar, and he's on a mission.
[53:53.780 --> 53:57.180]  Right, and it's inherently like...
[53:57.180 --> 53:58.780]  What was the name of the actor who played Tarkin?
[53:58.780 --> 53:59.780]  Peter...
[53:59.780 --> 54:00.780]  Peter O'Toole?
[54:00.780 --> 54:01.780]  Yeah.
[54:01.780 --> 54:02.780]  No.
[54:02.780 --> 54:03.780]  What is it?
[54:03.780 --> 54:07.340]  Yeah, that's exactly it, isn't it?
[54:07.340 --> 54:12.700]  Somebody will correct us if we're wrong.
[54:12.700 --> 54:17.380]  That guy just instantly commanded respect, because it's just who he is, right?
[54:17.380 --> 54:23.660]  You just had to respect him, whereas Hux, because he's like a young punk, you had to
[54:23.660 --> 54:24.660]  know that...
[54:24.660 --> 54:25.660]  Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[54:25.660 --> 54:26.660]  Peter Cushing was the name, not Peter O'Toole.
[54:26.660 --> 54:28.820]  Sorry, yeah, Peter O'Toole, yeah.
[54:28.820 --> 54:32.300]  It's funny, I was looking it up on my phone right now.
[54:32.300 --> 54:37.300]  But he commanded respect just because he was just this old British actor who you know as
[54:37.300 --> 54:38.300]  a kid...
[54:38.300 --> 54:40.460]  I don't even know what he was in, but you just know you've seen him in things, and then
[54:40.460 --> 54:41.460]  he's a classic.
[54:41.460 --> 54:42.460]  Yeah, his face is so...
[54:42.460 --> 54:43.460]  It's like Max Fonsetto.
[54:43.460 --> 54:44.460]  Exactly.
[54:44.460 --> 54:45.460]  Yeah.
[54:45.460 --> 54:47.740]  So, I thought that was pretty brilliant.
[54:47.740 --> 54:53.620]  I really liked it, and I like that the guy is a young punk.
[54:53.620 --> 54:56.300]  Yeah, definitely.
[54:56.300 --> 55:04.180]  Well, his arrogance and vigor really got sold because he was a young guy, I think.
[55:04.180 --> 55:09.300]  It's like he's too young and dumb to have actually thought about what the hell he's
[55:09.300 --> 55:19.820]  saying, and so he can deliver these kind of speeches with complete conviction, as opposed
[55:19.820 --> 55:25.100]  to having a sense of cynicism.
[55:25.100 --> 55:32.780]  You know, when you hear the Emperor deliver his talks, there's always a cynicism behind
[55:32.780 --> 55:34.380]  it.
[55:34.380 --> 55:37.740]  I think this guy is just a real believer, you know?
[55:37.740 --> 55:44.900]  He's like a born-again fascist, imperial, lackey leader kind of guy.
[55:44.900 --> 55:48.540]  Born-again fascist is such a great phrase.
[55:48.540 --> 55:49.540]  He really is.
[55:49.540 --> 55:50.540]  He's like...
[55:50.540 --> 55:53.460]  Who does that?
[55:53.460 --> 55:57.540]  Let's not get into politics.
[55:57.540 --> 56:00.220]  You could just see that he'd be voting for Trump, though.
[56:00.220 --> 56:01.220]  Yeah.
[56:01.220 --> 56:04.700]  Let's try not to go there.
[56:04.700 --> 56:08.980]  Let us take a break, and I want to tell you about Wealthfront.
[56:08.980 --> 56:14.660]  Wealthfront is a low-cost, automated investment service that makes it easy to invest your
[56:14.660 --> 56:17.300]  money the right way.
[56:17.300 --> 56:23.380]  It works 24-7 to manage your portfolio, keeping it diversified, customized to your risk profile.
[56:23.380 --> 56:27.100]  What you do when you sign up is they ask you, it takes like two minutes, they ask you just
[56:27.100 --> 56:33.180]  a few questions about how much risk you want to put in your investments, and then you give
[56:33.180 --> 56:38.900]  them your money and they put it in index funds, and you don't have to worry about it, and
[56:38.900 --> 56:40.040]  then you just walk away.
[56:40.040 --> 56:41.700]  Why would you use Wealthfront?
[56:41.700 --> 56:46.660]  More or less, it's like an automated internet service that replaces a personal financial
[56:46.660 --> 56:47.780]  advisor.
[56:47.780 --> 56:50.460]  Why would you use this instead of a financial advisor?
[56:50.460 --> 56:57.180]  Well, most financial advisors charge somewhere between 1-3% of the money under management.
[56:57.180 --> 57:01.940]  For every dollar you invest, they take 1-3% of it as their fee.
[57:01.940 --> 57:13.540]  Wealthfront only charges 0.25% of the money that is under management, and they only charge
[57:13.540 --> 57:19.600]  that once you get over $10,000 of your money that's invested there.
[57:19.600 --> 57:26.220]  If you follow this link from the show, they'll actually raise that minimum umbrella up to
[57:26.220 --> 57:28.980]  $15,000.
[57:28.980 --> 57:34.780]  The first $15,000 you put into Wealthfront, go through this link, wealthfront.com slash
[57:34.780 --> 57:37.580]  the talk show.
[57:37.580 --> 57:38.620]  It's all free.
[57:38.620 --> 57:43.000]  There's no fees at all, and then you only pay that management fee on what you invest
[57:43.000 --> 57:47.220]  over $15,000.
[57:47.220 --> 57:52.960]  You can get started for as little as $500, so you can just put $500 and see how it works.
[57:52.960 --> 57:57.820]  As they say here in these talking points, put your real money in later after you see
[57:57.820 --> 57:59.820]  how it works.
[57:59.820 --> 58:03.220]  Really easy.
[58:03.220 --> 58:10.340]  It's just a super easy way to invest money for the long term in a very smart way.
[58:10.340 --> 58:16.540]  As before, every time these guys sponsor, I am legally obligated to read this disclosure.
[58:16.540 --> 58:20.500]  If I don't read it, I will go to prison.

[58:49.460 --> 58:51.540]  My thanks to Wealthfront.
[58:51.540 --> 58:54.660]  Wealthfront.com slash the talk show is where you go to sign up.
[58:54.660 --> 58:55.660]  All right.
[58:55.660 --> 58:58.620]  We haven't really spoken about Rae yet.
[58:58.620 --> 59:00.620]  Amy?
[59:00.620 --> 59:05.060]  I love Rae.
[59:05.060 --> 59:06.900]  I think, how could you not like Rae?
[59:06.900 --> 59:08.900]  I love her.
[59:08.900 --> 59:14.220]  She was so exciting.
[59:14.220 --> 59:15.220]  That was another thing.
[59:15.220 --> 59:20.260]  Well, what were we going to say?
[59:20.260 --> 59:22.100]  I don't remember because you interrupted me.
[59:22.100 --> 59:24.340]  I was directing you to speak in the microphone.
[59:24.340 --> 59:27.140]  You can't because your big dumb face is there.
[59:27.140 --> 59:29.820]  Clearly, I mean, again, this is obvious.
[59:29.820 --> 59:31.180]  Anybody who's seen the movie knows this.
[59:31.180 --> 59:33.700]  She is the Luke Skywalker.
[59:33.700 --> 59:44.180]  She's the force-aware, force-capable 20-ish-year-old who's living on a desert planet and has
[59:44.180 --> 59:49.460]  dreams of bigger adventures.
[59:49.460 --> 59:51.460]  She's a pilot.
[59:51.460 --> 59:52.460]  She's the new Luke.
[59:52.460 --> 59:53.460]  She's better than Luke.
[59:53.460 --> 59:58.940]  She's better than Luke is exactly what I was going to say.
[59:58.940 --> 01:00:03.540]  Luke wants to go into whatever, Tamagotchi Station.
[01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:04.540]  That's not the word.
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:05.540]  I know.
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:06.540]  To get some power converters.
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:07.540]  To get some power converters.
[01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:08.540]  Tashi Station.
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:09.540]  Tashi Station.
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:10.540]  I was going to say Tashi Station.
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:14.060]  She will build you some damn power converters.
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:17.180]  She just made me so, so happy.
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:23.900]  I mean, she was just this amazing female character.
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:28.700]  I don't know if you remember, before the movie came out, J.J. Abrams was obviously doing
[01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:29.700]  a lot of press.
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:30.700]  He said something kind of...
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:31.700]  He's good at that.
[01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:38.060]  He just said something stupid, but I just felt like, well, give the guy a chance.
[01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:39.980]  I think he was trying to be coy.
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:40.980]  Right?
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:41.980]  Well, I just think he was.
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:47.020]  Let's face it, when we were little, girls did love Star Wars, but it was marketed towards
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:48.540]  boys.
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:55.300]  And I think that everyone who criticized him owes him an apology, because he said maybe
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:01:00.140]  one silly kind of dumb thing, but then in the movie, it was so true.
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:02.000]  I mean, she absolutely kicked ass.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  She was amazing.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:09.500]  Yeah, I think he said something like, Star Wars has always been a boys thing, but I hope
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:14.920]  with this movie, mothers will want to take their daughters and it'll be a girls thing.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:19.940]  And then people got bent out of shape because he was like, well, it wasn't always a boys
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:20.940]  thing.
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:22.940]  I was like, yeah, okay.
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:23.940]  True.
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:24.940]  He just misspoke.
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:26.820]  The guy said something stupid.
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:29.940]  But then he made a movie with a kick-ass female character.
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:34.720]  Yeah, he'd already made the movie when he said it, and he was trying not to be, he can't
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:41.180]  spoil it, and he's trying to be like, look, this is going to be more powerful women characters
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:44.980]  in this movie than you expect, is what he's trying to say.
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:48.300]  And then it's like, he screwed up.
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:54.540]  I really loved the introduction to her, cinematically.
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:02:03.580]  She's exploring the husk of a destroyed Star Destroyer on the surface of the planet.
[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:08.180]  And I thought it the first time I saw it, and I had this in mind the second time I saw
[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:09.180]  it.
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:17.020]  To me, I really do think it's almost an homage to Wall-E, that she lives this solitary life
[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:21.100]  that is, to me, a lot like Wall-E, in the way that Wall-E was cleaning up garbage and
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:25.420]  she was sort of scavenging the garbage for parts.
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:31.300]  But the way, too, that the entire introduction to her, she's by herself and she never mutters,
[01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:34.480]  there's never anything where she says anything, she doesn't talk to herself or anything.
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.180]  It's purely cinematic.
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:39.140]  You just see her exploring this thing.
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:40.700]  It's beautiful.
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:42.180]  It really does look real.
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:46.980]  I mean, obviously, I guess a lot of that was CGI, but unlike the prequels, to me, it really
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:51.500]  looked like they built a giant, empty Star Destroyer.
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.460]  And it established her character.
[01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:58.560]  It's like, wow, whoever she is, she knows the way that she's grappling around on these
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.220]  hooks and cables and stuff like that.
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:03.860]  She knows what she's doing.
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:10.140]  And then her excavation ends with her sliding down the dune like a sled.
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:13.200]  And it's just a little bit of whimsy that, to me, was like...
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:16.380]  But she's trying to have fun.
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:17.420]  I loved it.
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:24.900]  I loved the luxury that Tolkien is establishing, the way she lived her life.
[01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:29.040]  A lot of movies just have a faster pace these days.
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:34.700]  And maybe they'll drop a couple of lines of exposition like, oh, man, I can't believe
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:38.380]  I've spent another day scavenging in the Star Destroyer.
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:39.380]  Something like that.
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:42.660]  But this is so much better.
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:46.940]  It's nice and slow.
[01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:51.580]  The sled is whimsy, but it also just makes sense.
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:54.100]  You know that she's been doing this a long time.
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:55.140]  She collects a bunch of stuff.
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:56.140]  She puts on the sled.
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:04:00.700]  She slides down the thing and she carries it home on her speeder.
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:04.920]  And it was slow paced, but it was still enjoyable to watch.
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.860]  And I felt like it was slow paced and you got a lot out of it.
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:11.220]  Like you really got her isolation.
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:14.780]  And I thought it was really interesting.
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:19.060]  But like you said, it was a slow paced thing, but it was super enjoyable to watch.
[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:20.060]  I loved it.
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.680]  I loved that she was in line.
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:24.500]  She was in line to sell the parts.
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:29.340]  It's just perfect.
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:31.660]  The monotony of like, okay, I'm going to do this.
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:38.340]  I love the shot of her and she's cleaning off the parts that she's collected and she
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:43.820]  looks up and across the table from her is a weathered old woman.
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:49.780]  Not just an old woman, but an old woman who's clearly being beaten down by the sands and
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:53.660]  the environment that they're living in.
[01:04:53.660 --> 01:05:03.180]  It's very brief shot, but it registers with her and with us that like, okay, this is it.
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:04.180]  This is my future.
[01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:07.980]  This is me if I don't get something going.
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:11.500]  The other shot that to me was, it's just cinema.
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:12.500]  There's no dialogue.
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:20.140]  But when she tries on the helmet, she finds like a rebel X-wing pilot helmet and she tries
[01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:21.140]  it on.
[01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:26.100]  She tells you exactly what you think, she's dreaming of getting off the planet.
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:27.900]  She's eating her food all happy.
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:28.900]  Yeah.
[01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:29.900]  Like she's not...
[01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:32.180]  You know they're going to start selling that food at Disney.
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:36.460]  They're going to sell, I mean, they will sell anything at Disney and the Star Wars stuff
[01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:37.740]  is just out of control.
[01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:42.340]  They have opened up a new building in one of the parks just to sell Star Wars stuff
[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:45.140]  and they're going to sell those little gruel packets.
[01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:46.140]  I know it.
[01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:47.380]  And kids are going to go nuts.
[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:52.740]  One and a quarter portion.
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:57.660]  But I liked it that she was like, she had a smile on her face, like, okay, that was
[01:05:57.660 --> 01:05:58.660]  a day well done.
[01:05:58.660 --> 01:05:59.860]  I've got something to eat.
[01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:01.860]  I'm sitting here eating my thing.
[01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:08.060]  I've got my helmet feeling good.
[01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:09.060]  Well here's one more thing.
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:15.060]  Because it wasn't like an Oliver Twist kind of thing where it's like, oh God, everything
[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:17.060]  is awful and I'm the worst.
[01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:20.020]  It was like, no, make my way.
[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:23.820]  It's one of the subtle ways that I found her so much more likable than Luke in the first
[01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:31.620]  movie where Luke is so, you know, like, and he's like, oh, another season.
[01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:32.620]  Like poor me.
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:33.900]  Like, why is this happening to me?
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:36.740]  Like I have these big dreams, but I'm not really going to do anything about them.
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:39.320]  I'm just going to whine about my circumstance.
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:42.940]  And I didn't, you know what, I didn't get like a contentedness from Rey.
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:46.900]  I got a, hey, I'm putting up with this, but I'm going to do something.
[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:47.900]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:48.900]  Don't talk to me wrong.
[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:49.900]  I don't think she was content.
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:53.940]  I just thought that she took joy in small moments of like, I'm sitting here enjoying
[01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:54.940]  my thing.
[01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:58.260]  At least I'm eating for today and this is going to get better.
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:06:59.260]  Like I'm going to do something.
[01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:02.260]  I've got my happy helmet on.
[01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:03.260]  Which I love.
[01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:04.620]  I just love the idea.
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:12.140]  And you know what nobody talks about is the, so she marks off one day at a time on that
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:13.140]  wall.
[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:14.140]  Right.
[01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:15.140]  And there was a lot of marks.
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:16.140]  A lot of marks.
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:17.140]  Yeah.
[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:18.140]  Yeah.
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:26.100]  Clearly her backstory is it's a total JJ Abrams ism.
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:27.100]  Mystery box.
[01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:28.100]  Yeah.
[01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:29.100]  A mystery box.
[01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:31.700]  And including the fact that we don't hear her last name, I mean, obviously there's an
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:36.100]  awful lot of people who are speculating that maybe she's Luke's daughter.
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:37.820]  That she's Rey Skywalker.
[01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:42.540]  And yeah, I don't believe that she was left there for whatever mysterious reasons.
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:43.540]  I don't know.
[01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:48.260]  It's, there's gotta be some reason we don't know her last name and any other speculation,
[01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:53.900]  the other guests, you know, and going along typical star Wars lines where everybody ends
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:59.860]  up being somebody's brother or sister would be that she's a Han and Leia's daughter.
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:04.740]  But that, that to me doesn't seem plausible just because of the way that Han's interaction
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:05.780]  with her.
[01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:06.780]  Right.
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:09.220]  It doesn't even, if there was even a chance of that.
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:12.620]  She's Kenobi's granddaughter.
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:13.620]  We know that?
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:16.900]  No, we don't know that.
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:19.660]  That's what I choose to assert right now.
[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:21.500]  A, she's got the accent.
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:26.660]  B, we hear Kenobi speaking to her in a flashback sequence.
[01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:34.420]  C, Anakin and Kenobi went at it originally, which is kind of what set the whole thing
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:37.480]  off.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:41.620]  And I don't know what the other one is.
[01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:42.900]  I don't know the reason.
[01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:43.900]  I have heard.
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:44.900]  She's just awesome.
[01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:45.900]  I have heard.
[01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:49.100]  So she's got a, I'm a huge Obi-Wan Kenobi fan.
[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:50.500]  Like he's my guy.
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:53.860]  Uh, so I'm, I'm going with her being that.
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:58.300]  Or maybe she could be like his niece or something, but she, you know, maybe she's named Rey Kenobi.
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:08:59.300]  No, no.
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:04.420]  So, so my, I mean, my thing is like, you know what, if you look like Ewan McGregor and all
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:09.520]  of your buddies in the Jedi order get wiped out and you're stuck on Tatooine with nothing
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:14.280]  to do for 20 years, I think the cantina may look like a good place to have a little bit
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:17.220]  of fun if you know that.
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:20.220]  Have we thought about the fact that she might be Yoda's?
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:25.260]  Uh, I haven't thought about that.
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:27.500]  I had not thought about that.
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:29.260]  I don't want to know how that goes on.
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:30.260]  I don't.
[01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:31.260]  All right.
[01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:33.080]  Here's a complaint I have with the movie.
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:40.280]  One of my complaints is that they don't introduce any memorable vehicles that are new.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.100]  It's just, they've painted the TIE fighters black.
[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:45.540]  They have created a new two-seat TIE fighter.
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:46.540]  What is it?
[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:47.540]  Like the special forces TIE fighter.
[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:50.980]  That was a plot contrivance, right?
[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:55.740]  But it's, you know, it's the Millennium Falcon, X-wings, Star Destroyers, all the vehicles.
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:10:00.420]  There's no Y-wings, there's no TIE interceptors, there's no bombers, there's no A-wings, there's
[01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:01.420]  no B-wings.
[01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:02.420]  There's nothing.
[01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:03.700]  There's X-wings and TIE fighters.
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:04.700]  That's exactly where I'm going.
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:08.540]  We're the only cool new vehicle at all is Rey's speeder.
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:09.540]  Which...
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:10.540]  I didn't even like it.
[01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:11.540]  Oh, I kind of liked it.
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.540]  I did.
[01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:13.540]  I kind of liked it.
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:14.540]  It's like a land speeder, but we turned it on its side.
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:15.540]  I don't know.
[01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:16.540]  No, I kind of liked it.
[01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:20.620]  I think if I was a kid, I'd want, I would want the Rey's speeder toy.
[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:21.620]  I liked it.
[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:22.620]  It was kind of shitty.
[01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:23.620]  It's just a big box.
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:26.220]  No, because it makes sense, right?
[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:31.300]  It's like, what, she's not gonna be like going around with it like a dope ride.
[01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:32.500]  Whatever.
[01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:35.180]  It's like, this thing moves and that's all I care about.
[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:36.180]  It's utilitarian.
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:37.180]  It's totally utilitarian.
[01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:39.020]  Well, I guess I think it looks cool.
[01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:45.580]  My only complaint with it is that, given her career, she kind of needs like a pickup truck.
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:46.580]  Yeah.
[01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:48.700]  Something to haul things.
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:52.500]  Like in theory, she could, there could be some, some salvageable stuff in that Star
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:57.860]  Destroyer that, or whatever other records, you know, she's, she's exploring that would
[01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:00.980]  be too big to take on that thing.
[01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:02.260]  She kind of needs a truck.
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:08.220]  So my, my take it is that, uh, this scavenging has been going on for so long that there's
[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:10.380]  very little left.
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:11.700]  Yeah.
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:17.160]  You get, like, she's climbing way up to get like a little tiny part that, you know, she
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:18.160]  takes.
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:19.160]  Right.
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:23.060]  I don't think, like all of the good stuff was gone like 20 years ago, basically before
[01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:24.060]  she was born.
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:26.100]  It's kind of my big take on it.
[01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:27.100]  Right.
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:28.100]  It's a rough life.
[01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:29.100]  Yeah.
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:30.740]  It's not just scavenging.
[01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:37.780]  It's like, like picking the, like the just little scraps of meat off the bones at this
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:38.780]  point.
[01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:39.780]  All right.
[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:41.780]  So the other new major character is Finn.
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:45.060]  What do you guys think about Finn?
[01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:46.060]  I love him.
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:47.420]  I liked him a lot.
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:48.420]  Yeah, me too.
[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:54.420]  He's like a, you know, when it's, he's like a good guy and, uh, like he's finding himself
[01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:55.420]  throughout the movie.
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:58.100]  Like, I think it's fun.
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:00.820]  He's got a good heart and he has bad luck.
[01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:03.020]  And I like that he's kind of the bumbler.
[01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:04.020]  You know what I mean?
[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:06.180]  They may have heard the badass and he's kind of the bumbler.
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:07.180]  I like that.
[01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:08.180]  I like that.
[01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:11.420]  Well, and I think it compares well in, in, in the first scene where we really get to
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:12.420]  see him.
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:16.100]  I mean, we obviously there's the, the, the bad, the opening battle where he, he, for
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:21.540]  whatever reason, you know, has broken through the indoctrination of these stormtroopers
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:24.300]  and, and has serious moral qualms.
[01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:27.560]  I really hated that though, because stormtroopers don't bleed.
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:33.000]  And I realized like the, the, the use of that, you know, that he, it marks him and it shows
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.540]  that he's affected, but stormtroopers have never bled.
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:38.860]  I thought it was weird.
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:40.420]  I agree.
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:41.420]  It was weird.
[01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:45.700]  It definitely broke the expectations of the Star Wars movies.
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:54.300]  Um, but I think the fact that we saw a stormtrooper bleeding humanized them, which, which allowed
[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:56.460]  us to then like, go ahead and, you know,
[01:12:56.460 --> 01:13:00.260]  Right, like he was like, holy crap, we're killing people here for no reason.
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:01.260]  We're just mad.
[01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:06.980]  Yeah, but like just the mere fact that a stormtrooper, also, uh, that stormtrooper didn't have a
[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:07.980]  glove on.
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:08.980]  Yeah.
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:09.980]  Yeah.
[01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:15.100]  Like, and it doesn't make sense, not if it makes sense, just keep rolling.
[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:16.380]  Stop thinking, keep rolling.
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:17.380]  Okay.
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:21.540]  He's a human and now we're expressing his human and he kind of has a bond with this
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:25.260]  guy and that's it, like just
[01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:31.380]  I vividly remember in my childhood, what, you know, when the movies were new and I was
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:36.500]  a little kid, that one of the recurring arguments that me and my friends would have, or a debate,
[01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:39.700]  I guess, was exactly what are the stormtroopers?
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:40.700]  Are they people?
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:41.700]  Are they clones?
[01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:45.620]  Are, you know, cause they mentioned the clone wars, you know, is that are they clones?
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:47.420]  And I remember a lot of my friends thought,
[01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:53.180]  Obviously people, because they switch, you know, they, uh, Han and Luke take their outfits.
[01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:57.340]  Yeah, but I, there were people who, I remember I had friends who argued that they were droids,
[01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:59.300]  that they must've been like robots.
[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:00.300]  And then even the one,
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:01.300]  Cause friends are stupid.
[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:05.840]  And that they, you know, that, that I agree that it was stupid and it wasn't my argument,
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:10.060]  but it was enough of a mystery that there, at least some kids would argue that they were
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:15.020]  droids and that Han and Luke had like hollowed out the, you know, taking all the robot kids
[01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:16.020]  out.
[01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:17.500]  That would have taken a lot of time.
[01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:18.500]  I agree.
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:19.500]  It's stupid.
[01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:20.500]  It wasn't my argument.
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:23.460]  It was way harsh for childhood friends.
[01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:28.020]  Uh, no, but I've always seen him as, as, uh,
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:30.980]  I don't want to throw them under the bus, but my childhood friend, I'll just name them.
[01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:32.740]  David Neumoyer thought that they were droids.
[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:34.620]  Okay, David, I'm sorry, man.
[01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:37.260]  I don't, didn't mean to call you stupid.
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:39.340]  You made a good case for it though.
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:40.340]  I bet he did.
[01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:42.220]  I was a 10 year old.
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:43.220]  All right.
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:45.700]  So I, I love, I love the scene.
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:50.860]  I really love the scene where, where, where Poe and Finn first meet.
[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:56.820]  And I, to me, and, and it's where JJ Abrams really just nailed it.
[01:14:56.820 --> 01:15:03.620]  Where Poe Dameron is clearly like a, uh, right out of, you know, mythology.
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:05.020]  He's the hero's hero.
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:06.020]  He's brave.
[01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:07.020]  He's never afraid.
[01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:09.980]  He's got a square jaw that could bake like a granite block.
[01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:11.460]  He felt like Indiana Jones.
[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:14.940]  Like that's, and even the jacket, I felt like, wow, he's an Indiana Jones.
[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:15.940]  Yeah.
[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:19.620]  And like a typical, you know, like when James Bond gets captured, he's never like worried,
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:22.220]  you know, that he's not going to, he just figures out something's going to happen.
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:23.220]  I'm going to get out of it.
[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:24.220]  And he's got that.
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:28.920]  It's like your thing where he's read the script ahead and he's got that confidence.
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:34.540]  And Finn is a perfect foil because Finn is like literally in like a flop sweat.
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:38.260]  I mean, he is like in like, he's having like the crisis of his life.
[01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:41.700]  He knows that captain Phasma is onto him.
[01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:45.060]  You know, he's supposed to go down to, um, what does she say?
[01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:46.380]  I want your weapon inspected.
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:47.380]  They're going to figure out.
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:50.420]  He never, she says, uh, uh, report to division.
[01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:55.460]  I don't even know what that means, but it's like, uh, kind of doesn't sound good.
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:58.660]  And there's that line where he's like, why are you doing this?
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:15:59.740]  Are you part of the resistance?
[01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:02.220]  And he, and Finn is like, it's just the right thing to do.
[01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:03.220]  And he goes, you need a pilot.
[01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:05.140]  And he goes, yeah, I need a pilot.
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:06.140]  And it's funny.
[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:10.340]  And that really did that moment in the movie, watching it, it really struck me that for
[01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:16.500]  all of the, the book length criticism you can have of the prequel trilogy trilogy and
[01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:21.100]  what's wrong with it, that the dialogue is stilted and the characters are lame and it's
[01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:24.740]  the plot is all this political stuff and you don't even know who the bad guys are because
[01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:27.220]  it seems like both sides are really working for the emperor.
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:28.220]  So there's no bag.
[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:32.720]  And you can go on and on and on and talk about the effects and how everything was green screen.
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:37.400]  But it really hit me when with that joke of, yeah, I need a pilot that, you know what,
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:42.020]  one of the huge, huge gaping flaws in the prequel trilogy is there's nothing funny in
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:43.020]  them at all.
[01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:44.940]  And a Star Wars movie should be funny.
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:45.940]  Yes.
[01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:46.940]  Yeah.
[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:51.540]  You need to hit the funny action beats like in a certain way.
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:56.260]  But like I said earlier, it's all corny funny, but it's like, you know, that's okay though.
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:57.260]  Right.
[01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:58.260]  Right.
[01:16:58.260 --> 01:16:59.260]  No, it's in a good way.
[01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:01.460]  And that's why, like I said earlier, like you got the feeling that the people who made
[01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:04.040]  this movie really loved Star Wars.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:08.120]  And I feel like they hit so many of the jokes in the right way.
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:13.500]  Like the joke about, you know, when they're running toward the ship and he's like, what
[01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:14.500]  about that one?
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:15.780]  And she's like, no, that one's garbage.
[01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:18.860]  And then, you know, then they have to go to that one.
[01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:20.020]  And it's the Millennium Falcon.
[01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:21.020]  That's such a great joke.
[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:24.520]  Like it's such a Star Wars, like it just hits the perfect tone of Star Wars.
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:27.580]  And the main theme kicks in.
[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:32.620]  Like the camera turns to show the Millennium Falcon and it does like, dun, dun, dun, dun,
[01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:33.620]  dun.
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:34.620]  It's so exciting.
[01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:35.620]  Yeah.
[01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:36.620]  I don't know.
[01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:38.920]  Now we're playing for real, you know.
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:41.520]  It's such a perfect Star Wars joke.
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.780]  Totally corny.
[01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:45.900]  But yet you laugh anyway.
[01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:50.580]  So that scene with Poe and Finn is amazing.
[01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:55.880]  Because it immediately establishes Finn's character, who actually doesn't even have
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:56.880]  a name yet.
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:05.780]  But it establishes him as like, a guy that knows what the good thing to say is.
[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:09.360]  Like he knows what the right thing to do and say is.
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:12.900]  But he's actually just really out for himself.
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:14.940]  Like I'm letting you go because it's the right thing to do.
[01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:15.940]  Oh, you need a pilot.
[01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:18.180]  Yeah, I need a pilot.
[01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:21.600]  Like, he knows what the thing to say is.
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:25.300]  And then he's just, he can't, he can't hold it together.
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:29.620]  Like he can't lie very well, you know.
[01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:32.540]  And that comes up again and again in the movie.
[01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:33.540]  Yeah.
[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:38.340]  And so one of the parallels, I think, and it's not an exact parallel, but clearly Finn
[01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:43.940]  is in a certain way, he is the Han Solo of this movie, where he's the character who's
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:51.100]  really just looking out for his own interests, and lying and bluffing his way through everything.
[01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:58.420]  Where Han was sort of, as soon as you met him, he was grizzled and competent.
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:07.420]  Finn is competent in some ways, but definitely not, not world-wise, like Han was, right?
[01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:10.780]  Right, because he's been a programmed stormtrooper this whole time.
[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:16.100]  So I think it's amazing that he has as much thought as he does have.
[01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:17.500]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:22.620]  If anything, it's kind of impressive that he's not more of an asshole.
[01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:27.260]  Not to take out of the moment, but did we tell our son that we're doing this?
[01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:31.020]  And is it weird that he hasn't wondered where we are?
[01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:35.340]  I just thought of that.
[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:38.420]  And he doesn't know where we are, and he's not concerned.
[01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:43.020]  He'll figure it out.
[01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:55.900]  He's just got new video games for Christmas, and I haven't seen him upright in days.
[01:19:55.900 --> 01:20:03.380]  One of the things that, in the first Star Wars movie, is Han and Luke, you really don't
[01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:05.900]  see them together much.
[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:10.620]  They're on the Millennium Falcon, and Obi-Wan is telling them about the force, and Han-
[01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:13.500]  I always assumed it's because Han can't really stand him.
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:18.380]  And Han says, I've been all around the galaxy, I've never seen anything that makes me believe
[01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:21.580]  in an all-powerful force that controls my destiny.
[01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:26.620]  And then they're on the Death Star, and the only real scene they have together is that
[01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:33.580]  scene where they decide to go rescue Princess Leia, and Luke is like, she's rich, there'll
[01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:34.740]  be a big reward.
[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:35.740]  More than you can imagine.
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:38.100]  I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit.
[01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:43.100]  Well they shoot their way out, they end up in a garbage compactor.
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:46.100]  But it's mostly action, but somehow they're not together for that much.
[01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:50.420]  I mean, it's obviously more than Poe and Finn are together, but it's not that much.
[01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:55.700]  But the way that it works, though, is that when Empire Strikes Back starts, and Luke
[01:20:55.700 --> 01:21:01.340]  says, on his communicator, Han, old buddy, and when Luke doesn't come back, and Han is
[01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:04.220]  like, that's my friend out there, I'm gonna-
[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:07.340]  You know what it is, it's when Kenobi gets cut down.
[01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:08.340]  Yeah.
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:11.900]  They're both standing right there, and they see it happen, and I think that's the moment
[01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:13.300]  where it's like-
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:18.100]  There's something about the interaction between Finn and Poe that, to me, even though it's
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:22.060]  really minimal in this movie, it's just that one scene where they escape together, and
[01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:26.500]  then when they're reunited, and he's like, hey, that's my jacket.
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:34.340]  But somehow, if the next movie starts, it'll just feel like Poe and Finn are best buddies
[01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:37.560]  and comrades with the deep camaraderie.
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:41.060]  That's one of those things that J.J. Abrams really nailed.
[01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:42.060]  Yeah.
[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:46.740]  Well, I mean, I don't know, but I would bet a huge amount of money that the next movie
[01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:55.380]  is not gonna start back on that planet with Rey and Luke staring at each other.
[01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:56.380]  No, no, definitely.
[01:21:56.380 --> 01:22:03.700]  I think it's sort of like a tradition in Star Wars movies that something happens in between
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:04.700]  the movies, you know?
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:05.700]  You have to.
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:06.700]  What's the scroll gonna be?
[01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:09.780]  The scroll's gonna be like, episode eight.
[01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:11.780]  Did you see the last one?
[01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:15.060]  Like, what do you-
[01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:16.060]  It's not.
[01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:17.060]  Pause it.
[01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:18.060]  We'll wait.
[01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:24.860]  All right, let me take another break here and thank our next sponsor, our good friend
[01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:26.220]  at Igloo.
[01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:27.220]  You guys know Igloo.
[01:22:27.220 --> 01:22:32.980]  They make the internet that you'll actually like.
[01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:33.980]  Here's their story.
[01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:34.980]  Here's one of their angles that they have.
[01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:39.420]  What if you could give every one of your coworkers 5% of their day back?
[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:47.300]  Just by using Igloo to facilitate team communication and sharing files and to-dos and tasks and
[01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:53.380]  just sort of organizing, just providing the glue that keeps your team together, Igloo
[01:22:53.380 --> 01:23:00.220]  can give you back a huge chunk of your time because it's so much better than the old internet
[01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:05.780]  that you might be using or the hodgepodge of disparate tools that you might be doing
[01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:09.060]  instead of having it all together in one place.
[01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:10.880]  You already have enough work to do.
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:16.380]  Why waste time trying to organize the to-dos and the tasks and stuff like that?
[01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:18.980]  Go check out Igloo.
[01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:21.580]  They've got everything all in one system.
[01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:25.960]  They've got a little Twitter-like microblog, so imagine having a private Twitter that's
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:32.900]  just for you and your team, to-dos, file sharing, everything you need to get your work done
[01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:34.340]  to organize your team.
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:35.340]  Where do you go to find out more?

[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:48.960]  slash TTS.
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:49.960]  Use that URL.

[01:23:57.940 --> 01:24:00.760]  If your team's small enough, you don't even have to worry about paying for it.
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:03.020]  Go check them out at Igloo Software.
[01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:05.340]  Do you like that?
[01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:07.340]  You're getting better at those.
[01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:08.340]  You're really good at those.
[01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:12.260]  I don't listen to your show, but this is really good.
[01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:14.340]  You're getting better.
[01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:20.140]  I can't wait to hear you pronounce the next one, though.
[01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:29.840]  This might be a Pixelmature type situation.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:32.300]  So we've talked about Ray.
[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:33.300]  We've talked about Finn.
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:37.900]  He really does, doesn't he?
[01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:38.900]  So we talked about Ray.
[01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:39.900]  We talked about Finn.
[01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:47.160]  Poe is man candy who can fly an X-ray and pretty great.
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:49.340]  He's got to have a bigger role in the next movie, right?
[01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:50.340]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:53.660]  He's sort of going to take the place of Han Solo, I think.
[01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:55.300]  I really liked him.
[01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:59.740]  The cool guy, handsome, like Guy said, square jaw.
[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:00.740]  He's got to be...
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:02.340]  Yeah, he was awesome.
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:03.820]  He's almost too awesome.
[01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:08.100]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:09.100]  So who are you left with?
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:10.100]  Kylo Ren.
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:11.100]  You want to talk about Kylo?
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:17.540]  Well, I was going to go to where Amy had said, no, not that one.
[01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:20.300]  That one's garbage, and they take off in the Millennium Falcon.
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:21.300]  And then...
[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:23.420]  That was so exciting.
[01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:30.260]  But then here come Han and Chewie, and the thing I want to talk about is this, that we
[01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:31.260]  find out.
[01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:34.500]  And I don't know what other people knew, but spoilers.
[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:35.500]  I came in.
[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:39.720]  I did know Han and Chewie were in the movie because I did watch the first trailer where
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:42.820]  there's Chewie were home.
[01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:43.820]  When they...
[01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:45.780]  And you knew they were going to come through that door, right?
[01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:47.380]  Yeah, I kind of did.
[01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:51.160]  You can see the framing.
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:55.980]  And I thought it was telling that when they thought maybe it was the first order that
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:26:01.060]  had boarded them, but they didn't clearly show the ship that had taken the Millennium
[01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:02.060]  Falcon in.
[01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:04.300]  So since they didn't show it, I thought, you know, this must be it.
[01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:08.540]  Well, it was getting sucked in through the front rather than through the belly of a starter
[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:09.540]  story.
[01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:10.540]  So I was like, yeah, this is weird.
[01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:12.300]  Yeah, it clearly wasn't a starter story.
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:16.780]  So when it was Han and Chewie, I wasn't surprised, and it felt like the movie had gone on long
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:19.060]  enough without him.
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:20.060]  But what about...
[01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:24.300]  I have to say, I really...
[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:28.500]  More than Han Solo getting killed in the movie, what bothered me more the first time I saw
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:39.260]  it was the idea that Han's backstory for this movie was that he was separated from Leia,
[01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:44.580]  obviously for some significant amount of time, maybe most of the 30 years or at least a lot
[01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:45.580]  of it.
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:47.140]  That bothered you?
[01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:49.220]  I think they fixed it about 20 years.
[01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:50.220]  Really?
[01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:54.980]  I thought it was always obvious that they could never be together, that they can't stand
[01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:55.980]  each other.
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:58.860]  I mean, they obviously love each other, but I just think that, you know, one of those
[01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:01.940]  not meant to be, like, they're not going to...
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:03.900]  Han screwed something up.
[01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:06.980]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:09.940]  Even if their son hadn't gone bad, Han screwed up.
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:10.940]  Right.
[01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:15.460]  But even more than being separated from Leia, even way more, actually, I was bothered by
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:22.140]  the idea that he and Chewie had lost the Millennium Falcon.
[01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:25.820]  I just feel like, all right, maybe he loses his family, you know, all right, that happens
[01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:26.820]  to...
[01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:30.460]  I mean, that can happen to a guy, but there's no way that Han Solo is going to lose the
[01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:31.460]  Millennium Falcon.
[01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:36.260]  So we're going to get divorced, but you're going to hold on to that Acura, and you'll
[01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:39.260]  be perfectly fine.
[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:47.540]  You're kind of a bad person.
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:49.420]  I don't know why I agreed to this.
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:51.540]  I like our car, but it's not the Millennium Falcon.
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:56.940]  If our car was as cool as the Millennium Falcon, I would say yeah.
[01:27:56.940 --> 01:28:00.540]  Like I kind of thought when they boarded that maybe, like, the idea was going to be that
[01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:05.140]  they had planted the Millennium Falcon there, and that maybe they'd explain it, maybe they
[01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:07.740]  wouldn't, but that it was part of their plan, and that's why they picked it up, because
[01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:09.480]  it was, like, left behind.
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:13.580]  The idea that they, Han and Chewie, haven't had the Falcon for some number of years really
[01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:14.580]  bothered me.
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:16.580]  He can't hold on to anything.
[01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:18.940]  He's not a good person.
[01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:23.100]  I mean, he's a good person, but he's not really good at life.
[01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:29.300]  Like, he's always fly by the seat of his pants, right?
[01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:31.300]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:39.780]  Look, like so much of this movie, it's a meta movie in so many ways.
[01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:43.260]  Han and Chewie not having been on the Falcon in 30 years is because we haven't been on
[01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:45.060]  the Falcon in 30 years.
[01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:46.060]  That's it.
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:50.460]  The reason R2D2 is asleep the entire time until after we blow up the Death Star is because
[01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:55.140]  R2D2 is the heart and soul of the movies.
[01:28:55.140 --> 01:29:00.300]  And after we've done the entire first movie again by blowing up the Death Star, rather
[01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:06.980]  than like a medal ceremony, we get to see R2D2 reboot magically out of the ether for
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:07.980]  no good reason.
[01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:11.820]  Oh, yeah, that's something that Jon and I spent a lot of time talking about, like, what
[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:13.460]  makes him wake up.
[01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:15.380]  It's a narrative, well, who cares?
[01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:16.460]  It's a narrative construct.
[01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:22.580]  It's like R2D2 is the heart of Star Wars, and he wakes up after we've seen the Star
[01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:23.580]  Wars.
[01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:26.580]  I like that we've spent two hours talking about it, and you're like, who cares?
[01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:27.580]  Well...
[01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:28.580]  I think he's right, though.
[01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:31.060]  I think you're absolutely right, too, like, I'm not, it's like the briefcase...
[01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:33.060]  You want to find like an in-universe excuse?
[01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:34.060]  I'm sure we can.
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:35.060]  I'm sure we can.
[01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:36.420]  It's like the briefcase in Pulp Fiction, you know what I mean?
[01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:39.060]  Like, you're not supposed to spend time dwelling on it.
[01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:40.060]  Doesn't matter.
[01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:41.060]  Right.
[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:42.060]  But...
[01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:47.220]  We've seen a Star Wars movie concluding with the destruction of a Death Star.
[01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:50.460]  Do you feel rekindled?
[01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:52.580]  Here's the movie title, The Force Awakens.
[01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:53.580]  What happens?
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:54.580]  The Force Awakens.
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:56.980]  R2D2 awakens and literally tells you.
[01:29:56.980 --> 01:30:02.420]  See, I think it's like his mental connection with Luke, and Luke was like, you know...
[01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:11.500]  I actually think that Luke, like, forced diddled him, or like, turned him on in some way.
[01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:15.700]  I think Luke was like, hey, you chill out till I send you a signal, and then I'll send
[01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:17.820]  you a signal, and you come to life.
[01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:23.980]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I used the word diddle for that, but yeah, so I think he, in-universe
[01:30:23.980 --> 01:30:28.460]  I think, in terms of writing the script, it's like, who cares?
[01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:33.180]  It's like, R2D2 represents something to us.
[01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:39.700]  And the fact that we have the new droid BB-8 bump him and, like, want to resurrect him
[01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:46.660]  is, again, meta commentary on, like, we have to, you know, we're trying to reboot these
[01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:49.080]  old movies, we're trying to get them back.
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:56.100]  The whole thing about inheritance, and how, even just the scavenger stuff, like, that
[01:30:56.100 --> 01:31:04.780]  the new people are scavenging parts from the old, you know, from the old Empire, or from
[01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:09.260]  the old series, and they're reusing them, like, all of this is just, it's...
[01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:14.020]  Right, that's for us to say, oh my gosh, look at that, you know, look at the old ship, or...
[01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:16.060]  Now, I agree with you, I think that the whole thing...
[01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:18.780]  Well, just as a meta commentary, like, the...
[01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:20.820]  The movie is scavenging the old movies.
[01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:21.820]  Exactly.
[01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:22.820]  Oh, that's interesting.
[01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:23.820]  Exactly.
[01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:26.420]  Like, the whole thing, like, it works on, like, a lot of different levels.
[01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:29.140]  Not that I'm saying, like, this movie is high art or anything, but...
[01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:31.220]  Yeah, don't get crazy, but...
[01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:36.340]  But it's, I think it would be, I think it's silly to think of it in terms of, like, well,
[01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:38.420]  man, they already made this movie.
[01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:39.420]  Yes.
[01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:40.420]  Okay.
[01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:41.420]  Thank you.
[01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:44.500]  Now, can we think about why, maybe, they made these choices?
[01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:51.060]  And I think that the reason they made these choices is, you know, it's a modern myth,
[01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:55.140]  and retelling a myth is part of being a myth.
[01:31:55.140 --> 01:32:02.580]  And it's certainly, you know, in terms of the scavenging of the R2D2 thing, like, the
[01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:10.140]  acknowledging what has come before is a large part of what this movie is about.
[01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:12.300]  And I think it's, like, an intentional choice, you know.
[01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:16.540]  Here's what I've, upon thinking about it, after, like Mike said, my initial reaction
[01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:22.060]  was that it really bothered me that they decided that Han had lost the Falcon at some point.
[01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:23.060]  We lost the Falcon.
[01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:24.060]  That's the thing.
[01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:25.060]  We...
[01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:26.060]  Right.
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:27.060]  I agree.
[01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:28.060]  And that works for me.
[01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:33.980]  But the other thing, too, is I also really like the idea, once it settled in, that rock
[01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:37.660]  bottom for Han Solo, he still had Chewbacca.
[01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:43.060]  So, like, the fact that he'd lost the Falcon just showed just how far he's fallen, and
[01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:50.820]  it lends some weight to, like, that Han Solo, General Solo, and he says, I used to be.
[01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:51.820]  I like it.
[01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:54.820]  I actually, it bothered me at first, but I...
[01:32:54.820 --> 01:33:00.540]  I love that line, because it works for Han Solo, and it works for Harrison Ford, too.
[01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:05.140]  And the other thing, too, that really struck me about this movie, it's by far, and I've
[01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:11.700]  always been a fan of Chewbacca, and I've always thought that Chewbacca is an underrated special
[01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:18.700]  effect, because to me, he is the most credible and believable alien creature in any movie
[01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:19.700]  ever made.
[01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:20.700]  Yeah, I'd go with that.
[01:33:20.700 --> 01:33:28.240]  You just never doubt, and so many of the effects in the original Star Wars, they're good, but
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:32.700]  they kind of hold up only with nostalgia, whereas Chewbacca, he really, he does not
[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:34.620]  look like a man in a suit.
[01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:37.020]  He looks like a Wookie.
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:41.420]  And I don't know what they did, you know, like the, what was that magazine where kids
[01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:43.460]  that would have all the, Fangoria?
[01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:44.460]  Fangoria.
[01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:45.460]  Fantastic?
[01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:52.620]  I remember Fangoria, but like, just the effects that they did to make his mouth not look like
[01:33:52.620 --> 01:33:55.100]  a human mouth, and everything.
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:59.360]  He's always been a super credible alien, and I loved it, but this movie, to me, was by
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:01.980]  far and away the best Chewbacca movie ever.
[01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:09.660]  Yes, he, on his own, he kind of steals the show, and in terms of just emphasizing what
[01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:13.180]  an incredible friendship he and Han Solo have.
[01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:14.180]  Really?
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:19.220]  Because I think, okay, I'm not dwelling on it, but I think he got over it pretty quickly.
[01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:23.460]  I mean, Han Solo died, and I think one of the second things I turned to you and said
[01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:27.500]  after Han Solo died was, oh my god, poor Chewie.
[01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:30.740]  After I said, why couldn't it have been Chewie?
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:32.700]  They did, they did a disservice to that.
[01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:36.900]  Yeah, I felt like he just wasn't, because then after what he's flirting with that nurse,
[01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:37.900]  come on.
[01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:38.900]  Han Solo died.
[01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:39.900]  No, wait.
[01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:40.900]  No, that was before.
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:41.900]  Was it before?
[01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:43.900]  I've only seen the movie once.
[01:34:43.900 --> 01:34:44.900]  Yeah.
[01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:45.900]  No, it's cool.
[01:34:45.900 --> 01:34:46.900]  That was before.
[01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:47.900]  Okay.
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:48.900]  Yeah.
[01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:49.900]  But I just feel like-
[01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:50.900]  That was kind of adorable.
[01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:51.900]  That was adorable.
[01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:52.900]  That really was adorable.
[01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:53.900]  But I didn't think he was broken up enough.
[01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:54.900]  Yeah, it was pretty good.
[01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:56.900]  I feel like, well, who knows?
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:35:00.820]  I feel like Chewie's got- Well, he shoots a family member.
[01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:01.820]  Right.
[01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:02.820]  Right.
[01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:07.700]  Which is very not like the Chewbacca we've ever seen.
[01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:09.940]  He may strangle Lando.
[01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:15.260]  Lando got Han Solo frozen in carbonite and sold to the Empire and then back to Jabba
[01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:16.260]  Hutt.
[01:35:16.260 --> 01:35:17.260]  He shot Han-
[01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:18.260]  And he didn't kill him on sight.
[01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:19.260]  He shot Han.
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:21.440]  He shot Han's son, who Han was willing to die to dry rescue.
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:26.020]  And Chewie was like, screw you, you kill Han Solo, I'm shooting you.
[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:27.020]  Yeah.
[01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:28.020]  He's a friend.
[01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:29.020]  And he got him pretty good too.
[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:32.740]  And they spent a lot of time in that movie establishing that that thing hurts.
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:33.740]  Right.
[01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:34.740]  No, they did.
[01:35:34.740 --> 01:35:36.620]  They were like, hey, can I try that?
[01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:39.220]  And he shot it and two stormtroopers just blow up.
[01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:42.500]  He doesn't even hit them and they just blow up.
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:47.380]  They spent a lot of time establishing that that thing is, that's going to sting.
[01:35:47.380 --> 01:35:52.100]  I feel like you guys take this a lot more seriously than I do and you have some super-
[01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:53.100]  You think?
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:54.100]  I don't know.
[01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:56.220]  But you guys have some super insights.
[01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:59.260]  I would have guessed so, but I mean, you're actually heartbroken.
[01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:00.260]  Like you-
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:01.260]  No, I was truly-
[01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:04.780]  I was texting you and I just was like, oh man.
[01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:09.560]  I texted John right after and I'm like, I'm sorry, I think it made Amy sad because I talked
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:10.560]  about Han Solo.
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:12.260]  I know, like it really got to me.
[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:15.260]  But let's talk about like, because Jonas got one for Christmas.
[01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:17.480]  Let's talk about Kylo Ren's lightsaber.
[01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:22.380]  Like why does it have like a stick at the bottom that you can cut yourself open with?
[01:36:22.380 --> 01:36:27.200]  Like it's got the crossy thing and Jonas still insists that Han Solo died with the crossy
[01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:28.200]  thing.
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:29.980]  Like Han Solo's not going out with the crossy thing.
[01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:30.980]  Like he got the big end.
[01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:31.980]  Oh.
[01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:32.980]  But why?
[01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:37.980]  You can't take out Han Solo with the crossy end because you know, it's like a cross.
[01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:39.980]  No, no, that was pointed right at his chest.
[01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:40.980]  Right, right.
[01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:41.980]  It's so obvious.
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:42.980]  I mean-
[01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:43.980]  It's going right through him.
[01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:44.980]  He's a stupid kid.
[01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:45.980]  But what-
[01:36:45.980 --> 01:36:46.980]  He's not a stupid kid.
[01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:47.980]  He's a hopeful, lovely kid that-
[01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:48.980]  I'm his mother.
[01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:55.620]  I wish, I wish, I wish I was that hopeful that Han Solo would come back, but he's dead.
[01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:56.860]  He was so sure.
[01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:58.400]  And I was just like, no, and stop.
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.660]  And then him saying it was getting me more upset.
[01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:06.940]  I love that, I love that you're like, I'm more emotionally affected by this than you.
[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:09.540]  And Jonas was just like, it's fine, mama, it's fine.
[01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:13.780]  I was like, you don't understand, I have loved Han Solo my whole life.
[01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:15.780]  I cannot be your mother right now.
[01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:18.340]  I need to deal with this loss of Han Solo.
[01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:20.700]  And seriously, on the way home, he was like, he's fine.
[01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:25.180]  I was like, just get out of my face, get out of my face, I can't take it.
[01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:26.620]  It was a real ugly scene.
[01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:29.180]  Yeah, this breaks families apart.
[01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:35.580]  But why does his thing have that, it's like a half a Darth Maul at the bottom, and it,
[01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:39.380]  like Jon and I were saying, it just seems like you're going to stab yourself.
[01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:41.360]  His lightsaber makes no sense.
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:45.900]  My take on it is that the production designers wanted to make an original lightsaber.
[01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:51.500]  So they could sell more, like the Darth Mauls where they had the double side of what?
[01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:52.900]  This is better than Darth Maul.
[01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:53.900]  This is way better than Darth Maul.
[01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:59.460]  But he had, he wielded his like, like Rey's stick, like in the middle and twirled and
[01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:00.460]  stuff like this.
[01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:04.380]  But this one just has one like, I imagine Kylo Ren has a whole bunch of robes that have
[01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:09.220]  like cuts in them because Oh, shoot, I cut myself with my lightsaber because he's not
[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:10.220]  that good at it.
[01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:16.420]  Well, he does use one of the edges to hurt Finn, right?
[01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:18.780]  It just doesn't seem like a practical design, though.
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:19.780]  It's exactly-
[01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:20.780]  It's an impractical design.
[01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:21.780]  But we bought one.
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:24.380]  So I mean, something's working.
[01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:33.740]  So that sort of worked out.
[01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:40.860]  These are the kinds of things that kept me up about this movie.
[01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:42.860]  There's so much about this movie that we haven't even addressed.
[01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:45.340]  We didn't talk about Princess Leia at all.
[01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:46.340]  All right.
[01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:47.800]  Well, let's talk about Leia.
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:49.700]  I cried a little when I saw her too.
[01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:51.420]  I was so excited.
[01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:55.860]  Well, how great that scene where Han and Leia are reunited.
[01:38:55.860 --> 01:39:01.100]  It's my favorite scene in the whole thing where Han and Leia are reunited.
[01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:03.700]  And like, it's such a good Star Wars joke.
[01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:07.980]  And then C-3PO pops up and he's like, what does he call him?
[01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:10.780]  Does he call him Captain Solo?
[01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:15.380]  And then he says, perhaps you did not recognize me because of my red arm.
[01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:18.540]  It's so funny.
[01:39:18.540 --> 01:39:19.700]  It's so perfect.
[01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:20.700]  It is I, C-3PO.
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:26.060]  Perhaps you did not recognize me because of my red arm.
[01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:33.060]  And Han Solo, of course, recognizes him because he hates him and he looks totally the same.
[01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:39.500]  One of the best things about Han Solo is that he hasn't just murdered C-3PO at this point.
[01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:42.980]  Like that is the defining characteristic.
[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:48.300]  Between Chewbacca and Han Solo, I can't believe he's allowed to live.
[01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:49.300]  I love C-3PO.
[01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:50.300]  I do.
[01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:51.300]  I love him.
[01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:54.500]  He's such a fussy little annoying.
[01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:58.060]  There's a bunch of weird stuff happened about the droids.
[01:39:58.060 --> 01:40:01.300]  BB-8, it appears, knows C-3PO.
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:02.300]  Right.
[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:03.980]  And certainly, why wouldn't he?
[01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:08.020]  Because they all hang out at the Resistance base when they're out and out on missions.
[01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:16.300]  And yet, he uncovers R2-D2 and C-3PO has to explain to BB-8 that R2-D2 is asleep.
[01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:21.140]  It's like, yeah, BB-8 would have known that because you guys have been hanging out for
[01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:23.100]  like 20 years now.
[01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:27.420]  And every time he pokes him, nothing happens.
[01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:29.460]  Well, you know what I do?
[01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:43.180]  I kind of like that droids giving other droids exposition doesn't count as clunky dialogue,
[01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:45.820]  I guess.
[01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:47.500]  Why is he telling him this?
[01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:51.380]  This little droid should have known that for a long time.
[01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:57.980]  Because we don't know it and we don't have any words coming out of BB-8's mouth.
[01:40:57.980 --> 01:40:58.980]  We're fine.
[01:40:58.980 --> 01:40:59.980]  You know what I mean?
[01:40:59.980 --> 01:41:02.100]  We can just accept it.
[01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:04.420]  Here's a scene I really didn't care for.
[01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:10.860]  I did not care for the scene on Han and Chewie's new freighter where they have these three
[01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:18.140]  captured animals and two different pirate crews somehow easily breaking the ship.
[01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:19.320]  Oh, I liked it.
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:21.260]  I thought it was exactly like what he said.
[01:41:21.260 --> 01:41:23.380]  Like, I'm going to talk my way out of this just like I do everything.
[01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:29.900]  I thought it was a fun little like, it may be a little sad, but go ahead.
[01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:31.340]  I didn't dislike it.
[01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:35.460]  It's not like I thought that they should take it out, but they could cut that and nothing
[01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:36.460]  would change.
[01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:37.460]  Yeah, it doesn't really do much.
[01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:42.060]  Yeah, it doesn't really do anything, but I just liked seeing Han Solo, like being Han
[01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:43.060]  Solo.
[01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:52.700]  Here's my take on it, is that this movie is beat for beat along with Star Wars.
[01:41:52.700 --> 01:42:03.440]  And in Star Wars about mid-script, so they get on a ship that is called Garbage and they
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:09.580]  get picked up by basically like a garbage scow and then they end up fighting a tentacle
[01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:14.980]  monster, all of which is akin to falling down the garbage chute, getting into the trash
[01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:19.380]  compactor and then fighting the tentacle monster in Star Wars.
[01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:25.980]  And so I think beat for beat, they wanted some kind of tentacle monster at this point
[01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:26.980]  in the script.
[01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:33.740]  Right, but it also established like a trust for Rey and it gave Rey a chance to be a badass.
[01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:40.260]  And I love the relationship between Han Solo and Rey, I love the way he so obviously respects
[01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:48.180]  her, but he's not the kind of person to just say like, wow, I think you're great.
[01:42:48.180 --> 01:42:58.140]  I think it has some purpose, but I don't think that giant CGI tentacle balls was necessarily
[01:42:58.140 --> 01:43:00.900]  the best way to establish that.
[01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:01.900]  It was a bit much.
[01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:06.460]  It was a very J.J. Abrams scene to me and it also felt a lot more like his Star Trek
[01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:11.740]  stuff, like in the one Star Trek movie where there was the monster chasing Kirk on the
[01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:14.700]  ice planet.
[01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:18.660]  It just felt like that rather than feeling like Star Wars, because to me, what makes
[01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:25.140]  Star Wars Star Wars a lot of the time is that the action scenes are sort of allowed to breathe
[01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:30.340]  and they're not like diced up in the editing room as quick, quick, quick, quick, quick
[01:43:30.340 --> 01:43:31.340]  shots.
[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:39.380]  And the action plays out in the frame and that scene was to me more like any current
[01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:42.740]  decade science fiction alien movie.
[01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:49.500]  Yeah, it felt a bit more modern than I maybe wanted it to.
[01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:52.060]  And Finn getting dragged away and not eaten is like...
[01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:53.060]  Yeah, that was weird.
[01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:54.060]  That was weird.
[01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:55.060]  Like, why?
[01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:58.380]  Like, I don't understand the motivation of the creatures.
[01:43:58.380 --> 01:44:04.780]  Not that I need to necessarily understand them, but how come they're eating some guys
[01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:05.780]  and not...
[01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:07.620]  They're going to drag him around for 10 minutes.
[01:44:07.620 --> 01:44:09.740]  And you knew he wasn't in danger.
[01:44:09.740 --> 01:44:11.180]  I knew he wasn't going to die.
[01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:12.180]  Yeah, of course.
[01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:15.740]  Now, there was one moment, I think Guy, maybe you even said this to me, Guy, when we were
[01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:20.500]  chatting about the movie, but that there is a...
[01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:25.660]  When Han shoved the one bad guy into the alien's mouth.
[01:44:25.660 --> 01:44:34.620]  It was sort of a, to me, the nod was to the Han shot first argument.
[01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:35.620]  It was sort of...
[01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:36.620]  And to me, maybe...
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:38.620]  I'm not sure if that was me, but yeah.
[01:44:38.620 --> 01:44:43.140]  It was sort of the only FU they gave to George Lucas.
[01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:46.720]  The whole thing to me was pretty respectful of Lucas and the prequels.
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:54.200]  And I think Amy had hinted at this earlier, but to me, it was actually to me a very kindness
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:45:01.180]  that they did to George Lucas that they made Kylo Ren so clearly like Anakin.
[01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:06.740]  Not the Anakin that I wanted Anakin to be, but the Anakin that George Lucas wrote in
[01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:10.180]  the prequels.
[01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:12.580]  And then it works in terms of...
[01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:13.580]  They did a better Anakin.
[01:45:13.580 --> 01:45:14.580]  Right.
[01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:19.140]  But Han shoving the guy into the alien's mouth, just killing the guy, to me was like, hey,
[01:45:19.140 --> 01:45:22.740]  Han Solo is the guy who shoves guys into aliens and doesn't worry about it.
[01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:24.700]  He doesn't wait for them to shoot first.
[01:45:24.700 --> 01:45:25.700]  Yeah.
[01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:31.580]  That guy's just standing there, he punches him in the face, and then he takes a step
[01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:32.580]  back.
[01:45:32.580 --> 01:45:35.220]  He's like, oh, wait, I can use this guy for something more and grabs him and throws him
[01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:43.180]  into the mouth of the alien, totally needlessly.
[01:45:43.180 --> 01:45:50.000]  But I do think that kind of establishes his character a bit again.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:55.620]  Next up, though, is where...
[01:45:55.620 --> 01:45:56.940]  I think it's next, right?
[01:45:56.940 --> 01:46:01.080]  It's after they escape where they...
[01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:02.820]  After they get off that freighter where...
[01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:03.820]  Yeah.
[01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:08.420]  They blast out into light speed and then meet Maz Kanata at...
[01:46:08.420 --> 01:46:13.820]  Well, no, but first, he says to BB-8, let's see what you've got, and he projects the map.
[01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:15.120]  Oh, yeah.
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:18.820]  And gives the speech, you know, where, you know...
[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:19.820]  Right.
[01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:20.820]  So that's...
[01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:25.420]  This, to me, is the point where it really, really hit home to me that, oh, I see what
[01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:26.420]  they're doing.
[01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:29.820]  They're remaking the first film, but different characters are in different roles.
[01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:33.740]  And it really hit me that Han is the new Obi-Wan.
[01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:34.740]  Yeah.
[01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:36.660]  He's standing in the same spot, like, a couple of feet to the left kind of thing.
[01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:37.660]  Right.
[01:46:37.660 --> 01:46:38.660]  He's literally...
[01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:42.500]  It's the same room in the Millennium Falcon where Obi-Wan gave, as I call it, the speech
[01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:48.260]  where he explains what the Force is to the heroes who are going to fill out the rest
[01:46:48.260 --> 01:46:49.260]  of the trilogy.
[01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:52.740]  And Han is giving the speech, and he does a better job of it.
[01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:56.460]  I mean, you know, Alec Guinness was great, but it's like, when Han says, you know, it's
[01:46:56.460 --> 01:46:57.460]  all real.
[01:46:57.460 --> 01:47:00.100]  It's like, you know, I'm fighting back tears.
[01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:01.380]  It's like I'm choked up.
[01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:02.380]  Yeah.
[01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:10.500]  Well, Harrison Ford has the benefit of knowing the cultural weight of what he's saying, whereas
[01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:16.220]  Alec Guinness is like, can I do another movie about the bridge over the river Kwai?
[01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:18.540]  Because that was pretty great.
[01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:23.140]  So there's the speech on the Falcon, and I love it, and I think it really works, and
[01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:24.140]  it adds gravity.
[01:47:24.140 --> 01:47:28.060]  And then just jump back ahead to where he dies at the end, and he dies at the hand of
[01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:36.140]  the Darth Vader character, and it's witnessed by the new heroes who are younger and stronger.
[01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:37.140]  It's not just witnessed.
[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:38.900]  They are incapable of interfering.
[01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:39.900]  Right.
[01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:40.900]  Or intervening, I should say.
[01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:41.900]  They're helpless, right.
[01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:42.900]  They're helpless.
[01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:43.900]  All they can do is watch.
[01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:44.900]  Yeah.
[01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:52.780]  And, you know, it hits home for the audience this time in a way that when Obi-Wan got killed,
[01:47:52.780 --> 01:47:56.420]  I will admit, when I was a kid, I remember being surprised, and I also remember being
[01:47:56.420 --> 01:47:59.940]  confused about the fact that he disappeared, and I thought, well, maybe because that's
[01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:02.640]  the only guy who gets killed by a lightsaber in that movie.
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:07.380]  And this is another one of those things where I very distinctly remember, you know, first
[01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:13.800]  second grade arguing, like, whenever anybody gets hit with a lightsaber, do they just disappear?
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:18.940]  And it wasn't until Empire Strikes Back and you got to see Vader cut Luke's hand off that,
[01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:20.500]  you know, the no, it's just a thing.
[01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:22.420]  I just thought that was a Jedi thing.
[01:48:22.420 --> 01:48:29.060]  Because we see it even in A New Hope, the jerk at the bar gets his arm chopped off.
[01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:31.940]  Yeah, the only other guy who gets killed by a lightsaber is the guy at the cantina.
[01:48:31.940 --> 01:48:38.500]  And he doesn't die, but he gets, you know, well, I think you know, I think he died.
[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:40.220]  He definitely lost a lot of blood.
[01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:41.220]  We know
[01:48:41.220 --> 01:48:46.260]  He had a very bad day.
[01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:50.500]  This is a thing, though, that I remember thinking, and I've always thought it, but even as a
[01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:55.100]  little kid, I really wasn't that happy with the way that Obi Wan went down.
[01:48:55.100 --> 01:49:00.020]  And I realized what Lucas was going for, that he was sacrificing himself knowing that by
[01:49:00.020 --> 01:49:05.060]  doing this, you know, that the Luke and the others could escape on the Falcon.
[01:49:05.060 --> 01:49:09.580]  And that it was supposed to be some kind of symbolic, like Zen like state that he had
[01:49:09.580 --> 01:49:14.060]  reached that he was, you know, he's going to reach like some kind of higher plane of
[01:49:14.060 --> 01:49:15.060]  existence.
[01:49:15.060 --> 01:49:17.300]  I've always loved the Zen-like smile on his face.
[01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:18.300]  It bothered me, though.
[01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:20.260]  I was like, why not fight?
[01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:21.700]  Maybe you could beat this Darth Vader.
[01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:22.700]  He did.
[01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:24.420]  That's the thing.
[01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:27.900]  It bothered me.
[01:49:27.900 --> 01:49:31.620]  But at the end of Jedi, that's exactly how Luke wins.
[01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:34.900]  Well, I agree, but it bothered me.
[01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:39.020]  He defeats Vader and then it's just like, okay, look, I'm done.
[01:49:39.020 --> 01:49:41.900]  If you have to kill me, you're going to kill me.
[01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:49.860]  Whereas Han's sacrifice here and letting this guy, letting Kylo Ren kill him, it was way
[01:49:49.860 --> 01:49:54.940]  more believable than Obi Wan, or not believable, but to me, it was more satisfying than Obi
[01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:55.940]  Wan's.
[01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:59.500]  And I know Amy disagrees.
[01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:00.500]  But I really do think...
[01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:02.180]  I can't believe you found it satisfying.
[01:50:02.180 --> 01:50:05.340]  I just, I found nothing satisfying about it.
[01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:06.340]  Well, okay.
[01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:07.340]  Okay.
[01:50:07.340 --> 01:50:08.700]  We're not going to, let's not.
[01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:13.020]  So Obi Wan, I was surprised too.
[01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:16.780]  It didn't make a lot of sense, didn't register to me.
[01:50:16.780 --> 01:50:19.940]  Over the years, I've come to kind of maybe even rationalize it.
[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:26.080]  Maybe I'm like, maybe Star Wars has warped my brain enough that I'm like, now that's
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:35.100]  the framework that I see things in and I think that that kind of makes sense.
[01:50:35.100 --> 01:50:41.940]  The way Han Solo died, I think he's got to die, right?
[01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:42.940]  At some point.
[01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:43.940]  Right.
[01:50:43.940 --> 01:50:44.940]  Right.
[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:48.420]  But it was just, to me, it was like this whole culmination of, oh my gosh, Star Wars is back
[01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:50.820]  and oh my God, this movie is fantastic.
[01:50:50.820 --> 01:50:53.740]  And then, oh my God, they just killed like a childhood hero.
[01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:56.260]  Like with Obi Wan, I was not as invested.
[01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:59.640]  I was a young kid and I just, I wasn't as invested in him.
[01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:04.340]  And I just, and as a young kid, I was like, well, he's old, he's going to die anyway.
[01:51:04.340 --> 01:51:09.580]  Han, they didn't, they didn't kill Han.
[01:51:09.580 --> 01:51:14.380]  Han died making a choice, right?
[01:51:14.380 --> 01:51:15.380]  Like he knew.
[01:51:15.380 --> 01:51:16.380]  Yeah, but I think he told me.
[01:51:16.380 --> 01:51:20.020]  You can see the, you can see the look on his face before he, like he's hiding behind that
[01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:21.020]  column.
[01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:28.380]  Also, by the way, Kalloran, not very good at using the Force, because what the hell?
[01:51:28.380 --> 01:51:30.700]  He really sucks at the Force.
[01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:36.380]  You're letting this guy sneak up behind you, like, come on, like you're an idiot.
[01:51:36.380 --> 01:51:37.380]  Anyway, that aside.
[01:51:37.380 --> 01:51:40.540]  The girl who's never heard of the Force, beats him.
[01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:42.460]  All right, hold on, hold that thought.
[01:51:42.460 --> 01:51:43.460]  Let's come back to that.
[01:51:43.460 --> 01:51:44.460]  Let me just finish up here.
[01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:46.020]  And we got to get some of these other guests on the show.
[01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:47.780]  I see them sitting there in the Skype.
[01:51:47.780 --> 01:51:48.780]  We'll get them on soon.
[01:51:48.780 --> 01:51:51.500]  But I have one more sponsor to thank.
[01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:56.340]  And it is our good friends at Backblaze.
[01:51:56.340 --> 01:51:59.300]  I moved the sponsors around.
[01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:01.020]  It is not the one that's hard to pronounce.
[01:52:01.020 --> 01:52:03.620]  I'm sorry, I can't pronounce this one.
[01:52:03.620 --> 01:52:13.620]  It's Backblaze and Backblaze, you guys know Backblaze, it is unlimited, unthrottled backup
[01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:17.620]  for your Mac.
[01:52:17.620 --> 01:52:23.380]  You put Backblaze on your Mac, and it backs up everything, your startup drive, all of
[01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:24.380]  your files.
[01:52:24.380 --> 01:52:29.660]  You have external hard drives attached, it backs those up to Backblaze's cloud-based
[01:52:29.660 --> 01:52:30.660]  storage.
[01:52:30.660 --> 01:52:31.660]  So it gets it out of your house.
[01:52:31.660 --> 01:52:33.900]  You have a backup somewhere else.
[01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:40.860]  It is a great service, A, a great service, and B, a tremendous peace of mind that it
[01:52:40.860 --> 01:52:44.580]  gives you, knowing that everything that's important to you that's on your Mac is backed
[01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:45.760]  up somewhere.
[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:48.100]  What happens when you need to get a file back from Backblaze?
[01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:53.460]  Well, let's say disaster strikes, somebody comes in, steals your computer.
[01:52:53.460 --> 01:52:56.340]  You can go and get everything from Backblaze.
[01:52:56.340 --> 01:53:00.840]  They'll put it on a USB drive, sell you the drive at cost, and just ship it to you overnight.
[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:01.840]  You get it back the next day.
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:04.480]  You get a USB drive with all your stuff on it.
[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:05.740]  What if you only need one file?
[01:53:05.740 --> 01:53:07.280]  You just happen to be out of the house.
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:08.340]  It's not like a disaster.
[01:53:08.340 --> 01:53:09.980]  You don't need to restore a whole backup.
[01:53:09.980 --> 01:53:14.960]  You can just go to your iPhone, use the Backblaze app, and you can access any of your files
[01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:17.680]  there from your computer that have been backed up to Backblaze.
[01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:21.300]  Get it right there on your iPhone, your iPad, somebody else's computer, anywhere where you
[01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:23.860]  can get on a web browser.
[01:53:23.860 --> 01:53:27.100]  You can access any of the files that are backed up.
[01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:32.860]  A huge proportion of the stuff that they restore to users is just one file at a time.
[01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:33.940]  You just need something.
[01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:35.100]  You're not at your Mac.
[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:36.260]  You don't have your Mac with you.
[01:53:36.260 --> 01:53:37.260]  You can get it.
[01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:40.860]  So tremendous service.
[01:53:40.860 --> 01:53:41.860]  Go there.
[01:53:41.860 --> 01:53:42.860]  Here's where you go.
[01:53:42.860 --> 01:53:46.460]  You go to Backblaze.com slash Daring Fireball.
[01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:48.660]  That's the code for them, Daring Fireball.
[01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:52.860]  Backblaze.com, Daring Fireball, and they'll know you came from the show.
[01:53:52.860 --> 01:53:58.840]  If you don't have backup yet, New Year is the perfect time to make a resolution and
[01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:02.980]  start backing up your stuff because if you haven't lost data yet, you will eventually.
[01:54:02.980 --> 01:54:05.900]  Even SSDs fail at some point.
[01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:08.220]  So my thanks to them, longtime sponsors of the show.
[01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:10.140]  I use them personally.
[01:54:10.140 --> 01:54:11.140]  Great service.
[01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:13.620]  You did that without any notes.
[01:54:13.620 --> 01:54:14.700]  That was really impressive.
[01:54:14.700 --> 01:54:18.820]  I am going to be nice to you because it's the last day of the year.
[01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:22.100]  Because that's the one day of the year.
[01:54:22.100 --> 01:54:25.100]  It's his day.
[01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:28.580]  What about the fact that Han and Leia... Well, we're going to talk about the lightsaber fight,
[01:54:28.580 --> 01:54:29.580]  but here's a question.
[01:54:29.580 --> 01:54:32.540]  What about the fact that Han and Leia don't kiss?
[01:54:32.540 --> 01:54:35.380]  That's like a realistic portrayal of a-
[01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:36.380]  You know what?
[01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:37.380]  They don't say-
[01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:38.380]  Like a divorced couple?
[01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:39.380]  I love you.
[01:54:39.380 --> 01:54:40.380]  Yeah.
[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:41.380]  Because you don't want-
[01:54:41.380 --> 01:54:42.660]  There's obviously a deep affection, but they're not-
[01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:43.660]  No.
[01:54:43.660 --> 01:54:44.660]  They love each other.
[01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:45.660]  They don't-
[01:54:45.660 --> 01:54:46.660]  It's-
[01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:51.860]  You know, you don't need to say it at that point.
[01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:52.860]  It's not a-
[01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:57.380]  They haven't seen each other for a long time.
[01:54:57.380 --> 01:55:00.020]  Their son is their primary concern.
[01:55:00.020 --> 01:55:01.020]  And so-
[01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:02.200]  He's an a-hole.
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:04.940]  It's like I didn't want them to be apart.
[01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:08.020]  I didn't want them to have broken up.
[01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:09.020]  But I believed it.
[01:55:09.020 --> 01:55:10.020]  Like Amy said.
[01:55:10.020 --> 01:55:11.020]  I do kind of believe that-
[01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:12.020]  They just knew it.
[01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:13.020]  It just couldn't work.
[01:55:13.020 --> 01:55:14.020]  They're just both too-
[01:55:14.020 --> 01:55:15.020]  Yeah.
[01:55:15.020 --> 01:55:16.500]  They're both too used to being in charge.
[01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:17.500]  Yeah.
[01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:18.500]  It couldn't work.
[01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:21.140]  I mean, who doesn't want to be Han Solo?
[01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:22.180]  Who doesn't want to be Princess Leia?
[01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:24.220]  I spent my whole life like-
[01:55:24.220 --> 01:55:25.220]  Sure.
[01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:26.220]  Yeah.
[01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:27.220]  I mean, I wanted to be Princess Leia.
[01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:31.380]  I wanted to be a combination of Princess Leia Rizzo from Grease and Pinky Tuscadero from
[01:55:31.380 --> 01:55:32.380]  Happy Days.
[01:55:32.380 --> 01:55:33.380]  This is so dating me.
[01:55:33.380 --> 01:55:34.380]  Yeah.
[01:55:34.380 --> 01:55:35.380]  You know what?
[01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:36.380]  You're not far off.
[01:55:36.380 --> 01:55:37.380]  That's what I wanted to be.
[01:55:37.380 --> 01:55:38.380]  You're doing pretty good.
[01:55:38.380 --> 01:55:42.860]  Like I really, really wanted to be her.
[01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:43.860]  All right.
[01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:44.860]  So here is-
[01:55:44.860 --> 01:55:45.860]  Yeah.
[01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:46.860]  But I mean, you know.
[01:55:46.860 --> 01:55:47.860]  Come on.
[01:55:47.860 --> 01:55:48.860]  Han's going to screw it up.
[01:55:48.860 --> 01:55:49.860]  Han's going to do something.
[01:55:49.860 --> 01:55:50.860]  I believe it.
[01:55:50.860 --> 01:55:51.860]  And I thought that the-
[01:55:51.860 --> 01:55:52.860]  But Han's going to screw it up.
[01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:53.860]  And you know what?
[01:55:53.860 --> 01:55:54.860]  She's not going to take it.
[01:55:54.860 --> 01:55:55.860]  Like that's the other thing.
[01:55:55.860 --> 01:55:56.860]  Exactly.
[01:55:56.860 --> 01:55:57.860]  She's not going to be like, well, let Han be Han.
[01:55:57.860 --> 01:55:58.860]  She's going to say, screw you.
[01:55:58.860 --> 01:55:59.860]  That's what I love about her.
[01:55:59.860 --> 01:56:00.860]  Right.
[01:56:00.860 --> 01:56:01.860]  I feel like if they would have like-
[01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:06.300]  And I feel like he missed her way more than she missed him.
[01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:07.860]  I agree with that.
[01:56:07.860 --> 01:56:08.860]  Definitely.
[01:56:08.860 --> 01:56:09.860]  Yeah.
[01:56:09.860 --> 01:56:10.860]  He needs her more than she needs him.
[01:56:10.860 --> 01:56:11.860]  Well, that's why he keeps running.
[01:56:11.860 --> 01:56:12.860]  Right.
[01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:13.860]  Right.
[01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:17.260]  She's not scared to get off that troop transport and say hi to him.
[01:56:17.260 --> 01:56:18.260]  And he's like, oh god.
[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:19.260]  Okay.
[01:56:19.260 --> 01:56:20.260]  I got to talk to Leia.
[01:56:20.260 --> 01:56:21.260]  What does it say?
[01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:22.260]  Leia doesn't want to see me.
[01:56:22.260 --> 01:56:23.260]  Yeah.
[01:56:23.260 --> 01:56:24.260]  He's like-
[01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:25.260]  Yeah.
[01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:30.020]  He goes to see Maz Kanata to get the droid back to the Resistance because he's scared
[01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:31.020]  of facing Leia.
[01:56:31.020 --> 01:56:32.020]  Right.
[01:56:32.020 --> 01:56:33.020]  Well, all right.
[01:56:33.020 --> 01:56:35.660]  Here's the last two things I want to talk about.
[01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:37.860]  I want to talk about Maz Kanata.
[01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:38.860]  What's her name?
[01:56:38.860 --> 01:56:39.860]  Tanaka?
[01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:40.860]  Maz?
[01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:41.860]  I'll just call her Maz.
[01:56:41.860 --> 01:56:43.220]  I may be screwing up in there.
[01:56:43.220 --> 01:56:46.820]  And then I want to talk about the lightsaber fight at the end.
[01:56:46.820 --> 01:56:50.200]  And I don't care which order, which I guess we'll go in chronological order.
[01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:51.860]  So we'll talk about Maz first.
[01:56:51.860 --> 01:56:58.980]  I felt like that was probably the worst scene of the movie, that it just felt- the potential
[01:56:58.980 --> 01:56:59.980]  was there.
[01:56:59.980 --> 01:57:02.300]  And I liked the whole idea of it.
[01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:06.260]  But it just didn't seem right.
[01:57:06.260 --> 01:57:08.460]  I'm not sure why she's the CGI character.
[01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:09.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:10.460]  I found her very distracting.
[01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:14.460]  I found that character distracting because she just looked out of place.
[01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:16.580]  She looked like one of the characters from the prequels.
[01:57:16.580 --> 01:57:17.580]  Yeah.
[01:57:17.580 --> 01:57:18.580]  Right.
[01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:19.580]  Right.
[01:57:19.580 --> 01:57:20.580]  And she's an amazing actress.
[01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:21.580]  I think maybe they were trying to go for the Yoda thing.
[01:57:21.580 --> 01:57:22.580]  But it was like-
[01:57:22.580 --> 01:57:23.580]  Yeah.
[01:57:23.580 --> 01:57:24.580]  Yeah.
[01:57:24.580 --> 01:57:25.580]  She was trying to give a Yoda vibe.
[01:57:25.580 --> 01:57:26.580]  Yeah.
[01:57:26.580 --> 01:57:27.580]  And I have-
[01:57:27.580 --> 01:57:28.580]  And that actress is tall and slender.
[01:57:28.580 --> 01:57:29.580]  It's a very different Yoda-
[01:57:29.580 --> 01:57:36.940]  I have since heard, now that I'm not afraid of spoilers looking into it, that that whole
[01:57:36.940 --> 01:57:42.180]  scene was rewritten, and that the actress who played her had to come in and re-record
[01:57:42.180 --> 01:57:50.140]  all of her lines, that the way it was originally written was different.
[01:57:50.140 --> 01:57:58.060]  Like to the point where, at one point, she says, I'm no Jedi, but I know the Force.
[01:57:58.060 --> 01:58:02.860]  And that apparently, in earlier drafts, it was more clear that she had the Force.
[01:58:02.860 --> 01:58:09.140]  And that I actually just ordered the book, Renee was on the show, the previous episode
[01:58:09.140 --> 01:58:10.140]  to this.
[01:58:10.140 --> 01:58:13.340]  And Renee told me about this book, The Making of Star Wars, The Force Awakens.
[01:58:13.340 --> 01:58:14.780]  So I ordered the book.
[01:58:14.780 --> 01:58:19.020]  But one of the things in the book, it has all these effect shots and stuff like that,
[01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:22.100]  including some that aren't cut from the movie.
[01:58:22.100 --> 01:58:29.460]  But apparently, one of the scenes that was cut was in the battle that breaks out on her
[01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:34.860]  planet when the TIE fighters are busting up her bar and everything.
[01:58:34.860 --> 01:58:38.820]  There's like a part of the building is going to topple and might hit Finn or something
[01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:39.820]  like that.
[01:58:39.820 --> 01:58:43.500]  And she uses the Force to like, keep the blocks from hitting him.
[01:58:43.500 --> 01:58:44.500]  Hmm.
[01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:46.180]  That would have made more sense.
[01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:48.220]  Because what is she just like a Jedi groupie?
[01:58:48.220 --> 01:58:51.340]  Like why does she know so much about it?
[01:58:51.340 --> 01:58:53.260]  Well, it would have made more sense.
[01:58:53.260 --> 01:58:57.700]  Well I'm okay with her just being- Like a scholar of the Force?
[01:58:57.700 --> 01:58:59.420]  Uh, sensitive?
[01:58:59.420 --> 01:59:00.420]  I guess?
[01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:05.300]  Like having all the weird Force dreams and like being in tune with that kind of stuff?
[01:59:05.300 --> 01:59:06.300]  Well that's part of it.
[01:59:06.300 --> 01:59:11.180]  The other thing I've read, when I looked up who Max von Sydow's character is, this
[01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:14.100]  Lor San Tekka.
[01:59:14.100 --> 01:59:17.140]  I mean who knows because- It's Max von Sydow.
[01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:18.940]  Like they should just rename that character.
[01:59:18.940 --> 01:59:27.220]  Well his character is apparently, according to the Wookiepedia, is a- he's like a priest
[01:59:27.220 --> 01:59:29.740]  in the Church of the Force or something like that.
[01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:35.360]  And so they're not Jedi, but they're like, it's like another sect of good guys who use
[01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:36.360]  the Force.
[01:59:36.360 --> 01:59:41.900]  And I think it's similar to the way that these Knights of Ren aren't Sith, but they are bad
[01:59:41.900 --> 01:59:44.940]  guys who use the dark side of the Force.
[01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:49.900]  And the gist I've gotten from this is that in this, you know, they're broadening the
[01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:54.460]  view of the galaxy and the Force to the point where it's, you know, yes there are Jedi and
[01:59:54.460 --> 01:59:58.740]  there are Sith, or there were at least, maybe the Sith are dead, but that they're not the
[01:59:58.740 --> 02:00:01.940]  only two groups that use the Force.
[02:00:01.940 --> 02:00:02.940]  I don't know.
[02:00:02.940 --> 02:00:07.700]  But it seemed to me like this Maz was clearly supposed to be somehow, you know, and that's
[02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:14.700]  how she got the lightsaber, that she's, you know, she's got the Force in some way.
[02:00:14.700 --> 02:00:18.940]  But just the way that it came out on screen just felt like, blah.
[02:00:18.940 --> 02:00:19.940]  Right.
[02:00:19.940 --> 02:00:21.940]  There was no explanation of it.
[02:00:21.940 --> 02:00:22.940]  Yeah.
[02:00:22.940 --> 02:00:25.820]  It didn't really matter.
[02:00:25.820 --> 02:00:32.980]  I did love that flashback scene though, flash back forward, sideways, whatever the hell
[02:00:32.980 --> 02:00:39.380]  that was like the, the Force dream that when she first touches it, right?
[02:00:39.380 --> 02:00:40.380]  Yeah.
[02:00:40.380 --> 02:00:41.380]  Yeah.
[02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:42.380]  I feel like there's a lot of secrets in there.
[02:00:42.380 --> 02:00:43.380]  Like there's a lot.
[02:00:43.380 --> 02:00:44.380]  Yeah.
[02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:45.380]  Yeah.
[02:00:45.380 --> 02:00:47.780]  There's somebody there's, I guess I'll put a link to it in the show notes, but there's
[02:00:47.780 --> 02:00:54.180]  probably even more, but somebody, God bless them, but I, you know, somebody like obviously
[02:00:54.180 --> 02:01:00.060]  was videotaping the whole thing on their iPhone and posted a whole bunch of pictures to Reddit
[02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:01.060]  or somewhere.
[02:01:01.060 --> 02:01:05.460]  But there's a whole bunch of stuff in there, including the fact that it's, you know, at
[02:01:05.460 --> 02:01:11.500]  one point when you hear her name called out, it's Obi-Wan Kenobi calling her name.
[02:01:11.500 --> 02:01:12.500]  Yeah.
[02:01:12.500 --> 02:01:13.500]  Yeah.
[02:01:13.500 --> 02:01:20.260]  And it's, I thought that'd been said some of it, so Obi-Wan Kenobi calls out Rey and
[02:01:20.260 --> 02:01:22.420]  it's actually Alec Guinness's voice.
[02:01:22.420 --> 02:01:23.420]  Right.
[02:01:23.420 --> 02:01:28.220]  Did you, did John told me this story, but if you try to remember where I heard it, like
[02:01:28.220 --> 02:01:32.340]  I, so JJ Abrams was at some kind of, uh, oh yeah, it was JJ.
[02:01:32.340 --> 02:01:33.340]  Yeah.
[02:01:33.340 --> 02:01:34.340]  Okay.
[02:01:34.340 --> 02:01:35.340]  So it was like public.
[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:40.980]  So it was on stage at like a screenwriter Guild event for the Force Awakens and JJ said
[02:01:40.980 --> 02:01:47.740]  that they, um, they brought in, uh, what's the, who's the young Obi-Wan?
[02:01:47.740 --> 02:01:48.740]  What's his name?
[02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:52.340]  Well, the most recent one is the guy that did for the Clone Wars.
[02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:53.340]  Ewan McGregor.
[02:01:53.340 --> 02:01:54.340]  Ewan McGregor.
[02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:58.940]  Well, no, the, the, so the guy that did it for the Clone Wars recorded it all first.
[02:01:58.940 --> 02:01:59.940]  Yeah.
[02:01:59.940 --> 02:02:01.980]  So the guy who did the Clone Wars cartoon came in.
[02:02:01.980 --> 02:02:04.700]  And then gradually got replaced and he's like, okay, well.
[02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:08.900]  They got Ewan McGregor and so they were going to throw out the Clone War guy's thing and
[02:02:08.900 --> 02:02:15.440]  use Ewan McGregor's and then some of the sound guys, um, found an old clip of Alec Guinness
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:20.840]  where he said, uh, I forget what the afraid was afraid, right?
[02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:25.180]  He was saying the word afraid and they, you know, I don't even think that's from Star
[02:02:25.180 --> 02:02:26.180]  Wars.
[02:02:26.180 --> 02:02:28.480]  God knows where it's on, but yeah, who knows?
[02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:31.960]  But they found Alec Guinness saying the word afraid and clipped it.
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:37.500]  And that just the, the Ray part of the word afraid, it not only was Alec Guinness's voice,
[02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:41.700]  like JJ said, it was exactly the way I would have, if I could direct him to say it, it
[02:02:41.700 --> 02:02:43.980]  was exactly the way I would tell him to say Ray.
[02:02:43.980 --> 02:02:45.940]  But didn't they mix it with...
[02:02:45.940 --> 02:02:46.940]  Yeah.
[02:02:46.940 --> 02:02:48.980]  So they mix it with Ewan McGregor's to sort of get like, uh.
[02:02:48.980 --> 02:02:49.980]  Which isn't right.
[02:02:49.980 --> 02:02:50.980]  Oh.
[02:02:50.980 --> 02:02:51.980]  Come on.
[02:02:51.980 --> 02:02:53.700]  Well, you got to even it out a bit.
[02:02:53.700 --> 02:02:58.020]  They had Frank Ellis come in too and do the Yoda bit at the beginning.
[02:02:58.020 --> 02:02:59.420]  What was the Yoda bit?
[02:02:59.420 --> 02:03:08.300]  Uh, the, uh, like right when she starts tripping balls, uh, she says something about, uh, she
[02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:10.940]  hears Yoda say something, but like, oh, it binds us.
[02:03:10.940 --> 02:03:11.940]  It surrounds us.
[02:03:11.940 --> 02:03:12.940]  Oh, right.
[02:03:12.940 --> 02:03:13.940]  Right.
[02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:17.980]  Like that kind of like forced, like the beginning of the forced speech that she, uh, that, uh,
[02:03:17.980 --> 02:03:18.980]  Yoda gives.
[02:03:18.980 --> 02:03:21.300]  Well, here's a question.
[02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:27.700]  Do you think that the, like in the next movie, now that Luke is back, do you think Luke can
[02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:30.640]  still communicate with Obi Wan and Yoda?
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:35.580]  Or is there like a, like a time limit, you know, like, like after you're a Jedi, even
[02:03:35.580 --> 02:03:39.420]  if you know the trick that, that those guys know where you can still communicate with
[02:03:39.420 --> 02:03:44.740]  other Jedi after you died, is there like, you know, as the years go on, it gets weaker
[02:03:44.740 --> 02:03:48.020]  and weaker, you know, like a battery running out or something.
[02:03:48.020 --> 02:03:52.060]  I think we're, we're most likely to find Luke broken.
[02:03:52.060 --> 02:03:53.620]  I think he's a terrible alcoholic.
[02:03:53.620 --> 02:03:54.620]  Yeah.
[02:03:54.620 --> 02:03:55.620]  I do.
[02:03:55.620 --> 02:04:01.740]  And it's not alcohol, it's like, just a, like, he's a meditation hall, like, there's like
[02:04:01.740 --> 02:04:11.500]  a lot of Jedi yoga, whatever he does, you know, no, I think he's broken.
[02:04:11.500 --> 02:04:15.220]  I mean, you can tell by that last scene where he's like, well, first of all, he just runs
[02:04:15.220 --> 02:04:16.620]  away and he's disengaged.
[02:04:16.620 --> 02:04:17.620]  Yeah.
[02:04:17.620 --> 02:04:21.620]  And it seemed like they could really use, seem like they could really use his help.
[02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:22.620]  Yeah.
[02:04:22.620 --> 02:04:23.620]  You think?
[02:04:23.620 --> 02:04:24.620]  A little bit.
[02:04:24.620 --> 02:04:25.620]  Yeah.
[02:04:25.620 --> 02:04:34.620]  And, uh, I think, I think Rey and him are going to rehabilitate each other in some kind
[02:04:34.620 --> 02:04:35.620]  of way.
[02:04:35.620 --> 02:04:37.140]  He's going to be the Yoda.
[02:04:37.140 --> 02:04:44.300]  Yeah, he's going to be the Yoda and that's going to give him, I, I don't, I don't know.
[02:04:44.300 --> 02:04:49.380]  I kind of think that each one of these movies is going to kill off one of our old people.
[02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:56.660]  We've had Han go, uh, Leia or Luke is going to be next and then whoever's left will be
[02:04:56.660 --> 02:04:57.660]  in the last one.
[02:04:57.660 --> 02:04:58.660]  You can't kill Leia.
[02:04:58.660 --> 02:05:01.020]  You can't kill, I don't think you can kill Luke.
[02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:02.340]  Oh, you gotta kill Luke.
[02:05:02.340 --> 02:05:04.140]  Well, you can't kill him in the next movie.
[02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:07.580]  I'll kill Luke right now.
[02:05:07.580 --> 02:05:08.580]  What about, all right.
[02:05:08.580 --> 02:05:10.220]  You know who you can't kill?
[02:05:10.220 --> 02:05:12.540]  Han Solo is who you can't kill.
[02:05:12.540 --> 02:05:13.540]  Exactly.
[02:05:13.540 --> 02:05:14.860]  And it already happened.
[02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:18.980]  What about the fact that they, they're only going to make three of these.
[02:05:18.980 --> 02:05:22.540]  I know there's, there's these offshoot movies, you know, there's going to be a Boba Fett
[02:05:22.540 --> 02:05:29.020]  movie and that there's also supposed to be a young Han Solo, which I think sounds like
[02:05:29.020 --> 02:05:30.020]  a disaster.
[02:05:30.020 --> 02:05:31.020]  I think.
[02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:32.020]  Yeah, I know.
[02:05:32.020 --> 02:05:33.020]  I know.
[02:05:33.020 --> 02:05:36.900]  You can't even get River Phoenix to play him.
[02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:48.940]  Well, I'm just saying you can't get him, he's not, you know, he's like picking up the phone.
[02:05:48.940 --> 02:05:50.100]  He's a weird brother.
[02:05:50.100 --> 02:05:53.140]  But what about the fact that they, they're only going to make three.
[02:05:53.140 --> 02:05:55.180]  There's episodes seven, eight, and nine.
[02:05:55.180 --> 02:05:56.940]  They're only going to make three.
[02:05:56.940 --> 02:06:04.280]  He was available, but they decided like for the interest of drama and secrecy that Luke
[02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:08.380]  literally only appears in like 30 seconds, the last 30 seconds of the film and doesn't
[02:06:08.380 --> 02:06:09.540]  have a line.
[02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:11.100]  Was it a wasted opportunity?
[02:06:11.100 --> 02:06:12.820]  No, no, no.
[02:06:12.820 --> 02:06:16.020]  They used him exactly how they wanted to use him.
[02:06:16.020 --> 02:06:18.420]  I think, and they, I think they used him well.
[02:06:18.420 --> 02:06:25.740]  He is the, again, getting back to the meta thing, Luke Skywalker has been our hero in
[02:06:25.740 --> 02:06:33.420]  the, I mean, effectively in the three movies that mattered, like the original trilogy.
[02:06:33.420 --> 02:06:43.200]  And this movie is about resetting everything and getting us back to, you know, to where
[02:06:43.200 --> 02:06:46.660]  we were, to be finding what it is to be Star Wars fans.
[02:06:46.660 --> 02:06:48.580]  That's why R2 wakes up.
[02:06:48.580 --> 02:06:54.820]  And then we have like a five minute denouement.
[02:06:54.820 --> 02:07:01.660]  And then we have Rey, our new hero, handing the baton, like, I know I've said this before
[02:07:01.660 --> 02:07:03.820]  to you, John, but like literally it's a baton.
[02:07:03.820 --> 02:07:08.620]  Like it's, it's like, you can't make it more obvious, like trying to hand the baton back
[02:07:08.620 --> 02:07:09.620]  to Luke.
[02:07:09.620 --> 02:07:20.980]  And I think that that's just a visual storytelling, very metaphorical, you know, trying to bring
[02:07:20.980 --> 02:07:25.980]  back, like it's, it's a, it's passing of the baton from the old guard to the new guard,
[02:07:25.980 --> 02:07:27.980]  but it's flipped on his head kind of idea.
[02:07:27.980 --> 02:07:29.820]  You guys are so optimistic.
[02:07:29.820 --> 02:07:31.940]  I think Mark Hamill just needs more acting lessons.
[02:07:31.940 --> 02:07:37.500]  They were like, just turn around at the end and that's good and go back to class.
[02:07:37.500 --> 02:07:38.500]  He works a lot.
[02:07:38.500 --> 02:07:39.700]  It's just like a lot of voice work.
[02:07:39.700 --> 02:07:40.700]  He's on TV.
[02:07:40.700 --> 02:07:41.700]  He does do a lot of voice stuff, right?
[02:07:41.700 --> 02:07:42.700]  Yeah.
[02:07:42.700 --> 02:07:43.700]  Yeah.
[02:07:43.700 --> 02:07:44.700]  He's the Joker in the Batman animated series.
[02:07:44.700 --> 02:07:45.700]  Yeah.
[02:07:45.700 --> 02:07:46.700]  And the video games.
[02:07:46.700 --> 02:07:49.700]  But there's rules and he does a lot of voice work.
[02:07:49.700 --> 02:07:50.700]  Okay, sure.
[02:07:50.700 --> 02:07:51.700]  Sure.
[02:07:51.700 --> 02:07:52.700]  Oh, he looks amazing.
[02:07:52.700 --> 02:07:53.700]  I'm not saying he's ugly.
[02:07:53.700 --> 02:07:55.700]  I'm saying he's a bad actor.
[02:07:55.700 --> 02:07:57.860]  He's always been a bad actress.
[02:07:57.860 --> 02:07:58.860]  Right.
[02:07:58.860 --> 02:08:03.940]  Well, you know what a bad actress is?
[02:08:03.940 --> 02:08:09.180]  He's been, um, I don't know, a gross actor.
[02:08:09.180 --> 02:08:18.700]  And I mean gross, not in like disgusting, but in like a cigarette but he likes, he over-emphasizes
[02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:23.700]  like it's a, it's a very stage act-y kind of thing that he does, uh, like the Joker,
[02:08:23.700 --> 02:08:27.540]  like the Joker in the Batman, the animated series.
[02:08:27.540 --> 02:08:30.780]  Anyway, uh, I don't think he needed a line.
[02:08:30.780 --> 02:08:34.260]  I think they used them exactly the way they wanted them to be used.
[02:08:34.260 --> 02:08:37.980]  But using them this way means we'll never get to see Han and Luke together again.
[02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:38.980]  Nope.
[02:08:38.980 --> 02:08:39.980]  Why would you say this to me?
[02:08:39.980 --> 02:08:40.980]  That's okay.
[02:08:40.980 --> 02:08:41.980]  You know what?
[02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:42.980]  I didn't like them together anyway.
[02:08:42.980 --> 02:08:43.980]  I'm not gonna get upset.
[02:08:43.980 --> 02:08:48.980]  I'm not wasting my time.
[02:08:48.980 --> 02:08:51.520]  Uh, wait.
[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:54.500]  So let's go back and try to figure out when was the last time we saw them together?
[02:08:54.500 --> 02:08:55.500]  On Endor, right?
[02:08:55.500 --> 02:08:56.500]  Yeah, Endor.
[02:08:56.500 --> 02:08:57.500]  They definitely-
[02:08:57.500 --> 02:08:58.500]  In the Ewok village.
[02:08:58.500 --> 02:08:59.500]  Right.
[02:08:59.500 --> 02:09:00.500]  In the Ewok village.
[02:09:00.500 --> 02:09:02.060]  In the Ewok village or like all the planets.
[02:09:02.060 --> 02:09:07.700]  Like I confuse the Wookie planet with that one Led Zeppelin album.
[02:09:07.700 --> 02:09:08.700]  Like I'm not-
[02:09:08.700 --> 02:09:09.700]  Kashyyyk and-
[02:09:09.700 --> 02:09:10.700]  Yes!
[02:09:10.700 --> 02:09:12.900]  I get them confused all the time.
[02:09:12.900 --> 02:09:15.340]  I'm like, what's your favorite Led Zeppelin album, Kashyyyk?
[02:09:15.340 --> 02:09:19.900]  And he's like, that's the Wookie planet.
[02:09:19.900 --> 02:09:25.660]  I just, I really love the movies and, uh, but I don't have like an encyclopedia.
[02:09:25.660 --> 02:09:28.340]  Like Jonas has encyclopedias of this stuff.
[02:09:28.340 --> 02:09:32.480]  That was actually another one of my complaints, though, about Maz's, the whole thing on Maz's
[02:09:32.480 --> 02:09:34.140]  planet was that her planet-
[02:09:34.140 --> 02:09:35.140]  What's her planet?
[02:09:35.140 --> 02:09:36.140]  That's what I don't remember.
[02:09:36.140 --> 02:09:39.940]  I don't even, uh, do you think it sticks with an eye?
[02:09:39.940 --> 02:09:40.940]  And it looked too much-
[02:09:40.940 --> 02:09:41.940]  No, maybe not.
[02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:45.140]  It looked too much like the planet where the Resistance was headquartered.
[02:09:45.140 --> 02:09:52.740]  You know, it's just sort of like a Yavin 4-looking forest and rivers and stuff like that.
[02:09:52.740 --> 02:10:00.220]  Well, I've always kind of made fun of Star Wars for having like, one planet is all ice,
[02:10:00.220 --> 02:10:04.980]  one planet is all desert, and like one planet is all, and it's like, you're gonna run out
[02:10:04.980 --> 02:10:05.980]  of those pretty quick.
[02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:12.060]  Even Jonas is like, why don't all these desert people move?
[02:10:12.060 --> 02:10:13.060]  That is a smart kid.
[02:10:13.060 --> 02:10:14.060]  Yeah.
[02:10:14.060 --> 02:10:15.060]  There are lush planets.
[02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:17.060]  Like the Wookie planet is lush.
[02:10:17.060 --> 02:10:18.060]  Yeah.
[02:10:18.060 --> 02:10:19.060]  Kashmir.
[02:10:19.060 --> 02:10:20.060]  I don't know.
[02:10:20.060 --> 02:10:21.060]  Kashmir.
[02:10:21.060 --> 02:10:22.060]  It's my favorite.
[02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:23.060]  It's an Indian province.
[02:10:23.060 --> 02:10:27.500]  I do want to, we touched on it before, I want to talk about the lightsaber fight at the
[02:10:27.500 --> 02:10:28.500]  end of the movie.
[02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:29.500]  Yeah.
[02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:30.500]  We gotta talk about the bad guys at some point too.
[02:10:30.500 --> 02:10:31.500]  Well, yeah.
[02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:32.500]  Yeah.
[02:10:32.500 --> 02:10:35.220]  I thought the lightsaber fight was incredibly well done.
[02:10:35.220 --> 02:10:40.540]  And you can quibble about the fact that, you know, well, how would Rey hold her own without
[02:10:40.540 --> 02:10:44.500]  any training, you know, but you know, to me, it's just, she's super strong in the force
[02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:49.340]  and that Kylo Ren is not really that good.
[02:10:49.340 --> 02:10:55.780]  So Kylo Ren sucks at pretty much everything, which, Annie, I feel your pain.
[02:10:55.780 --> 02:10:56.780]  I really do.
[02:10:56.780 --> 02:10:57.780]  He sucks at life.
[02:10:57.780 --> 02:10:58.780]  He's bad.
[02:10:58.780 --> 02:11:05.300]  And you know what, like, okay, you know, bad thing aside, I hate the way, like, he's not
[02:11:05.300 --> 02:11:07.380]  good enough to be Han and Leia's son.
[02:11:07.380 --> 02:11:09.260]  Like, he's just not good enough.
[02:11:09.260 --> 02:11:12.860]  Like how could they ever, but it's like, I guess it's like Han says, you know, there's
[02:11:12.860 --> 02:11:14.780]  too much Vader in him.
[02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:15.780]  Yeah.
[02:11:15.780 --> 02:11:17.420]  You know, or too much Anakin, really.
[02:11:17.420 --> 02:11:18.420]  Yeah.
[02:11:18.420 --> 02:11:19.420]  And Darth Vader was awesome.
[02:11:19.420 --> 02:11:20.420]  I didn't help either.
[02:11:20.420 --> 02:11:23.460]  But there's too much Anakin in it.
[02:11:23.460 --> 02:11:28.500]  So A, he got shot by Chewbacca.
[02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:33.140]  Uncle Chewie shot him, but good.
[02:11:33.140 --> 02:11:34.140]  Uncle Chewie.
[02:11:34.140 --> 02:11:37.940]  Yeah, because if you think about it, though, you have to think that when he was a kid,
[02:11:37.940 --> 02:11:43.220]  you know, until he went bad, there's no way Chewie didn't change his diapers.
[02:11:43.220 --> 02:11:47.660]  And then he straight out called out, shoot the guy.
[02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:52.860]  Oh, what a moral dilemma for Chewie.
[02:11:52.860 --> 02:11:59.940]  Not really, Chewbacca, he's like, I'm taking you down, you whiny bastard.
[02:11:59.940 --> 02:12:05.500]  Oh, now that Han's out of the picture, boom, yeah, finally get to kill you.
[02:12:05.500 --> 02:12:07.900]  I really liked the lightsaber fight.
[02:12:07.900 --> 02:12:12.100]  I thought that it was what the lightsaber fights were supposed to be like, which is
[02:12:12.100 --> 02:12:14.860]  like a good sword fight in a kung fu movie.
[02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:16.740]  I love both of them.
[02:12:16.740 --> 02:12:24.380]  And not, you know, force powered people doing 40 foot triple Lindsey jumps in the air, you
[02:12:24.380 --> 02:12:26.740]  know, and doing all this fantastic stuff.
[02:12:26.740 --> 02:12:31.820]  It's just a couple of people like chasing in tight quarters, swinging lightsabers at
[02:12:31.820 --> 02:12:32.820]  each other.
[02:12:32.820 --> 02:12:39.620]  Yeah, I like the idea that you can be trained and be competent with a lightsaber.
[02:12:39.620 --> 02:12:46.140]  But if some random dude like Finn picks up a lightsaber, and he's, you know, he's got
[02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:52.700]  some kind of, he's a soldier, and we've seen the soldiers use the, that crazy baton thing
[02:12:52.700 --> 02:12:57.940]  earlier in the movie, he's, you know, he's not incompetent.
[02:12:57.940 --> 02:13:01.060]  I like that he can hold his own for a few minutes.
[02:13:01.060 --> 02:13:05.540]  I like the idea that maybe like the stormtroopers as part of their standard training are trained
[02:13:05.540 --> 02:13:10.340]  specifically just like anti Luke Skywalker, like we don't even know where this Luke Skywalker
[02:13:10.340 --> 02:13:11.340]  is.
[02:13:11.340 --> 02:13:14.940]  But if he comes back, we want you to have some training against a guy using a lightsaber.
[02:13:14.940 --> 02:13:22.300]  Well, so I've got the Force Awakens visual dictionary thing here.
[02:13:22.300 --> 02:13:27.500]  Did you notice that the guy that has the baton, like he drops his gun, but he's holding a
[02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:29.620]  shield at the same time.
[02:13:29.620 --> 02:13:32.900]  It's like basically riot gear.
[02:13:32.900 --> 02:13:37.540]  And he starts beating on him with his riot gear baton kind of thing.
[02:13:37.540 --> 02:13:43.300]  So yeah, like, I'm totally cool with the idea that like a stormtrooper can have some kind
[02:13:43.300 --> 02:13:44.640]  of basic training.
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:46.540]  And he's not, he's actually not good.
[02:13:46.540 --> 02:13:47.540]  He gets kind of destroyed.
[02:13:47.540 --> 02:13:48.540]  No he's not good.
[02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:49.540]  He's definitely playing with it.
[02:13:49.540 --> 02:13:50.540]  But he holds his own.
[02:13:50.540 --> 02:13:51.540]  But that's what makes it amazing.
[02:13:51.540 --> 02:13:53.100]  Because you're like, let her have it.
[02:13:53.100 --> 02:13:54.100]  Let her have it.
[02:13:54.100 --> 02:13:55.420]  Because you know that she's gonna kick ass with it.
[02:13:55.420 --> 02:14:00.700]  And he manages to, so here's the thing, he hits Kylo Ren in the shoulder and then that's
[02:14:00.700 --> 02:14:01.700]  it.
[02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:04.460]  Like the lightsaber goes flying after that, like Kylo's.
[02:14:04.460 --> 02:14:09.820]  What kind of piece of shit dude with the Force gets hit by an old stormtrooper with a lightsaber?
[02:14:09.820 --> 02:14:13.900]  Well he had been hit by Uncle Chewie had taken a chunk out of him.
[02:14:13.900 --> 02:14:16.740]  Yeah, he was bleeding.
[02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:24.500]  But he's also an arrogant, he's not good, he's not, he's just not, he's, he's not competent.
[02:14:24.500 --> 02:14:26.260]  He's like, not competent.
[02:14:26.260 --> 02:14:31.140]  That's like, and he knows he's not competent, which is I think why he has driving character
[02:14:31.140 --> 02:14:34.540]  like, yeah, that's, it's bad.
[02:14:34.540 --> 02:14:36.300]  Like, all right.
[02:14:36.300 --> 02:14:38.820]  We got we got to wrap it up soon.
[02:14:38.820 --> 02:14:39.820]  But what are you talking about?
[02:14:39.820 --> 02:14:40.820]  It's only two hours.
[02:14:40.820 --> 02:14:43.820]  Well, I don't know, we might have to cut some of the special guests.
[02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:46.820]  But we got to talk about this Supreme Leader Snoke, right?
[02:14:46.820 --> 02:14:49.660]  Oh, the Snoke that it didn't make any sense.
[02:14:49.660 --> 02:14:51.020]  Why did it look like Gollum?
[02:14:51.020 --> 02:14:55.580]  And that was another like CGI distracting thing that I thought didn't fit in with the
[02:14:55.580 --> 02:14:58.040]  whole movie.
[02:14:58.040 --> 02:15:00.180]  That is my least favorite thing.
[02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:01.620]  And is he like the Wizard of Oz?
[02:15:01.620 --> 02:15:03.500]  Like, is he a projection?
[02:15:03.500 --> 02:15:05.020]  Like, is that what it is?
[02:15:05.020 --> 02:15:06.020]  Like I have no idea.
[02:15:06.020 --> 02:15:07.340]  Yeah, he's a hologram and he's bigger than you.
[02:15:07.340 --> 02:15:09.020]  And really, he's like a little worm.
[02:15:09.020 --> 02:15:10.660]  Well, we don't know how big he is.
[02:15:10.660 --> 02:15:12.060]  Is he human size?
[02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:13.400]  Is he like Yoda size?
[02:15:13.400 --> 02:15:15.740]  Or is he actually like nine feet tall or something?
[02:15:15.740 --> 02:15:21.500]  I think I've heard somebody say that he's normal size.
[02:15:21.500 --> 02:15:22.500]  But he's obviously
[02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:23.500]  I could have been like an ILM girl.
[02:15:23.500 --> 02:15:25.540]  I could have been like, no.
[02:15:25.540 --> 02:15:29.620]  What you're supposed to get out of it, though, is that like hologram technology has improved
[02:15:29.620 --> 02:15:35.700]  in the last 30 years such that he looks like he's actually in the room 40 feet tall.
[02:15:35.700 --> 02:15:40.620]  And with the first time we see him where he's talking to Kylo Ren and General Hux or Admiral
[02:15:40.620 --> 02:15:42.620]  Hux, whatever his title is.
[02:15:42.620 --> 02:15:48.700]  And the way that it looks like he's there.
[02:15:48.700 --> 02:15:52.020]  And I had a bad I thought, Oh, my God, are they trying to tell me that this guy is 40
[02:15:52.020 --> 02:15:53.020]  feet tall?
[02:15:53.020 --> 02:15:54.400]  Because that's ridiculous.
[02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:56.620]  And then when he disappeared, it was like, Oh, I get it.
[02:15:56.620 --> 02:16:01.180]  It's just that hologram technology has gotten high def.
[02:16:01.180 --> 02:16:03.540]  He's just on the big screen.
[02:16:03.540 --> 02:16:04.540]  I don't like that guy.
[02:16:04.540 --> 02:16:05.540]  I don't like the way it looks.
[02:16:05.540 --> 02:16:11.660]  I don't know why you would make him look Star Wars to me like he didn't look right.
[02:16:11.660 --> 02:16:15.860]  I guess maybe I am influenced by the fact that he does look like Gollum.
[02:16:15.860 --> 02:16:19.060]  But like, it just it totally didn't fit.
[02:16:19.060 --> 02:16:22.900]  Just again, I don't I don't understand him at all.
[02:16:22.900 --> 02:16:24.180]  They keep going back to him.
[02:16:24.180 --> 02:16:25.180]  Right?
[02:16:25.180 --> 02:16:27.980]  It's not like they had like one scene and it's like, okay, I can figure that and keep
[02:16:27.980 --> 02:16:28.980]  moving.
[02:16:28.980 --> 02:16:32.060]  They just they just keep showing him over and over.
[02:16:32.060 --> 02:16:33.060]  I don't even know.
[02:16:33.060 --> 02:16:37.380]  And it's always it's always like a meeting like, we screwed everything up.
[02:16:37.380 --> 02:16:38.380]  What do you think we should do?
[02:16:38.380 --> 02:16:45.180]  I don't know your incompetent boobs like blow up on the planet like forget it, I'll find
[02:16:45.180 --> 02:16:46.180]  somebody better.
[02:16:46.180 --> 02:16:47.180]  Like, yeah.
[02:16:47.180 --> 02:16:49.780]  Even it's like John said, his name isn't good.
[02:16:49.780 --> 02:16:54.360]  It's like, that's like your kids like teddy bear Snoke, you know, like it's the worst.
[02:16:54.360 --> 02:16:57.020]  And he's the Snoke?
[02:16:57.020 --> 02:17:00.020]  Supreme Leader Snoke?
[02:17:00.020 --> 02:17:01.020]  Stupid.
[02:17:01.020 --> 02:17:05.940]  I really I it left me thinking, you know, because I'm a moron.
[02:17:05.940 --> 02:17:09.640]  So it left me thinking about a totally inconsequential plot point.
[02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:12.260]  Like I'm missing the movie because I'm like, what's going on here?
[02:17:12.260 --> 02:17:13.900]  But most of the other new names are good.
[02:17:13.900 --> 02:17:15.420]  Like Ray is a good name.
[02:17:15.420 --> 02:17:16.420]  Finn is great name.
[02:17:16.420 --> 02:17:17.420]  Kylo Ren is a good name.
[02:17:17.420 --> 02:17:18.940]  Kylo Ren is a good name.
[02:17:18.940 --> 02:17:24.420]  And then well, so first of all, cut No, you know, Kylo Ren.
[02:17:24.420 --> 02:17:29.300]  His actual first name before he went bad is Ben.
[02:17:29.300 --> 02:17:30.300]  Oh, right.
[02:17:30.300 --> 02:17:37.220]  So Ben, Ren, Ray, things get way too I forgot it.
[02:17:37.220 --> 02:17:40.220]  It's like everything's a little bit too close for that.
[02:17:40.220 --> 02:17:46.100]  That's a good moment, though, when when Han Solo calls Ben, that's, yeah, but you can
[02:17:46.100 --> 02:17:47.100]  hear it.
[02:17:47.100 --> 02:17:51.100]  I rolled my eyes.
[02:17:51.100 --> 02:17:52.660]  It's because it's the beginning of the end.
[02:17:52.660 --> 02:17:57.460]  As far as you're concerned, you're like, screw this movie.
[02:17:57.460 --> 02:18:01.420]  You rolled your eyes because you were busy like pouring petrol into like your coke bottle
[02:18:01.420 --> 02:18:03.140]  and like trying to light the fuse.
[02:18:03.140 --> 02:18:06.220]  I know I should have brought a cyanide pill to this movie.
[02:18:06.220 --> 02:18:07.220]  I was not.
[02:18:07.220 --> 02:18:08.220]  No, I didn't know.
[02:18:08.220 --> 02:18:12.380]  Let's just stick with a firebomb.
[02:18:12.380 --> 02:18:14.580]  What else do we want to talk about before we wrap up?
[02:18:14.580 --> 02:18:17.580]  So the actual lightsaber battle between Ray and...
[02:18:17.580 --> 02:18:19.380]  It's very important to me.
[02:18:19.380 --> 02:18:22.380]  All right, here's a question.
[02:18:22.380 --> 02:18:27.220]  In the next movies, does Ray build her own lightsaber because that's what Jedis do or
[02:18:27.220 --> 02:18:29.360]  does she continue to use Anakin's?
[02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:32.120]  She just uses Anakin's.
[02:18:32.120 --> 02:18:34.220]  She loses it at the end of the second movie.
[02:18:34.220 --> 02:18:38.060]  I think she uses that one.
[02:18:38.060 --> 02:18:39.180]  I think it's like a thing.
[02:18:39.180 --> 02:18:42.180]  And it's obviously spoke to her, you know?
[02:18:42.180 --> 02:18:43.780]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:18:43.780 --> 02:18:45.780]  But I think she's going to lose it at the end of the second movie.
[02:18:45.780 --> 02:18:47.780]  Maybe she gets her hand cut off in the next movie and loses a lightsaber.
[02:18:47.780 --> 02:18:48.780]  I think she will...
[02:18:48.780 --> 02:18:49.780]  Too much.
[02:18:49.780 --> 02:18:52.140]  I am kind of surprised that she didn't cut...
[02:18:52.140 --> 02:18:53.140]  Too much.
[02:18:53.140 --> 02:18:54.140]  I'll have to build one.
[02:18:54.140 --> 02:18:57.940]  I think she might have cut Kylo Ren's hand off.
[02:18:57.940 --> 02:18:58.940]  I don't know.
[02:18:58.940 --> 02:18:59.940]  So what else do we want to talk about?
[02:18:59.940 --> 02:19:02.620]  Do you think Ray is going to have her own lightsaber or do you think she's going to
[02:19:02.620 --> 02:19:03.620]  continue to use Luke's?
[02:19:03.620 --> 02:19:06.380]  I think she's going to lose it at the midpoint.
[02:19:06.380 --> 02:19:07.380]  Really?
[02:19:07.380 --> 02:19:08.860]  She's going to lose it next episode.
[02:19:08.860 --> 02:19:11.060]  Because they've got to sell more lightsabers.
[02:19:11.060 --> 02:19:13.460]  I mean, just being cynical.
[02:19:13.460 --> 02:19:14.460]  Well, okay, there's that.
[02:19:14.460 --> 02:19:15.460]  No, yeah, sure.
[02:19:15.460 --> 02:19:16.460]  Why not?
[02:19:16.460 --> 02:19:18.260]  That's a cynical way of looking at it.
[02:19:18.260 --> 02:19:19.260]  That's fine.
[02:19:19.260 --> 02:19:20.260]  Maybe.
[02:19:20.260 --> 02:19:26.940]  But just in terms of if we continue with kind of the mirroring aspect of what we've seen,
[02:19:26.940 --> 02:19:29.580]  she's going to have to lose it, right?
[02:19:29.580 --> 02:19:31.100]  Let's talk about Carrie Fisher.
[02:19:31.100 --> 02:19:32.900]  How many fucks does she not give?
[02:19:32.900 --> 02:19:36.060]  I love her press tours for this.
[02:19:36.060 --> 02:19:39.400]  She gives zero fucks about anything.
[02:19:39.400 --> 02:19:42.040]  She brings her janky little dog.
[02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:46.380]  I have never wanted to have sex with Carrie Fisher more than right now.
[02:19:46.380 --> 02:19:47.820]  More than Slave Leia.
[02:19:47.820 --> 02:19:48.820]  No, no, no.
[02:19:48.820 --> 02:19:49.820]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:19:49.820 --> 02:19:53.420]  She's a kid, you know, young boy kind of thing like, holy shit, look at that.
[02:19:53.420 --> 02:19:56.420]  That's like a woman.
[02:19:56.420 --> 02:19:58.720]  Carrie Fisher is just the best.
[02:19:58.720 --> 02:20:00.620]  She's amazing.
[02:20:00.620 --> 02:20:01.620]  She's really, really good.
[02:20:01.620 --> 02:20:03.100]  She seems to be having fun.
[02:20:03.100 --> 02:20:07.740]  Yeah, like she's having fun and she's just saying all the shit she's wanted to say.
[02:20:07.740 --> 02:20:11.380]  She's kicking so much ass.
[02:20:11.380 --> 02:20:13.740]  And then she had those tweets about because it is true.
[02:20:13.740 --> 02:20:15.940]  Like she got judged on her looks.
[02:20:15.940 --> 02:20:18.700]  And I think she I thought she looked amazing.
[02:20:18.700 --> 02:20:24.940]  If anything, a little too like Botoxed, which only to me I noticed because they let Han
[02:20:24.940 --> 02:20:27.840]  Solo be all like grizzled and he's way older, right?
[02:20:27.840 --> 02:20:28.840]  He's older than you.
[02:20:28.840 --> 02:20:29.840]  Yeah, he's cool.
[02:20:29.840 --> 02:20:30.840]  Yeah.
[02:20:30.840 --> 02:20:31.840]  Yeah.
[02:20:31.840 --> 02:20:35.340]  And yet, like, she's like, she's got a lot of Botox.
[02:20:35.340 --> 02:20:36.740]  And I just don't think that's fair.
[02:20:36.740 --> 02:20:39.260]  And I think that if it would have been up to Carrie Fisher, she would have been like,
[02:20:39.260 --> 02:20:40.260]  fuck you.
[02:20:40.260 --> 02:20:41.260]  I'm not losing weight.
[02:20:41.260 --> 02:20:42.260]  Fuck you.
[02:20:42.260 --> 02:20:43.260]  I'm not doing any Botox.
[02:20:43.260 --> 02:20:44.260]  I don't.
[02:20:44.260 --> 02:20:45.260]  I just I just like it.
[02:20:45.260 --> 02:20:46.740]  I just Yeah, I haven't let her have that.
[02:20:46.740 --> 02:20:47.740]  Oh, guess what?
[02:20:47.740 --> 02:20:48.740]  She doesn't look 24 anymore.
[02:20:48.740 --> 02:20:49.740]  Yeah.
[02:20:49.740 --> 02:20:50.740]  What do you expect?
[02:20:50.740 --> 02:20:51.740]  It's okay.
[02:20:51.740 --> 02:21:01.480]  You know what I feel like she feels and sounds and looks like old Princess Leia in a way
[02:21:01.480 --> 02:21:06.420]  that been through some shit, but in a way that it in a way that Harrison Ford doesn't
[02:21:06.420 --> 02:21:07.420]  inhabit.
[02:21:07.420 --> 02:21:14.020]  Well, what about in the in the goofy Kingdom of the Crystal Skull movie, the actors who
[02:21:14.020 --> 02:21:16.180]  plays Marion to me is like unrecognizable.
[02:21:16.180 --> 02:21:20.200]  Yeah, it's like and it doesn't feel like Marion at all.
[02:21:20.200 --> 02:21:26.280]  It doesn't feel like like somehow there it just every everything from just the way she
[02:21:26.280 --> 02:21:31.620]  looks to the interaction that the two characters have does not feel like Indy and Marion back
[02:21:31.620 --> 02:21:32.620]  together again.
[02:21:32.620 --> 02:21:39.540]  It just feels hollow and pantomimed in a way that Leia feels like, wow, that's that's 30
[02:21:39.540 --> 02:21:41.660]  years older Princess Leia.
[02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:42.660]  Yeah.
[02:21:42.660 --> 02:21:43.660]  And she's in charge.
[02:21:43.660 --> 02:21:44.660]  Right, right.
[02:21:44.660 --> 02:21:51.420]  And she's kicking some ass and Han Solo is still way overstretching himself.
[02:21:51.420 --> 02:21:52.420]  Right.
[02:21:52.420 --> 02:21:53.820]  He's still a little bit of a fuck up.
[02:21:53.820 --> 02:21:54.820]  You know what I mean?
[02:21:54.820 --> 02:21:55.820]  He's always a fuck up.
[02:21:55.820 --> 02:21:59.820]  But yeah, at this point, it's like, he's, he's beat like that little.
[02:21:59.820 --> 02:22:01.380]  It's sadder because he's older.
[02:22:01.380 --> 02:22:02.380]  Well, yeah, like that.
[02:22:02.380 --> 02:22:03.820]  I mean, the gang's the truth.
[02:22:03.820 --> 02:22:07.540]  Tell them like, kid, there's nobody else to screw over in the galaxy.
[02:22:07.540 --> 02:22:09.860]  Like you're, you're done.
[02:22:09.860 --> 02:22:14.580]  There's nowhere to hide.
[02:22:14.580 --> 02:22:18.260]  Leia, on the other hand, is kind of on the top of the game.
[02:22:18.260 --> 02:22:19.260]  She's like, no, look, cool.
[02:22:19.260 --> 02:22:20.260]  Come.
[02:22:20.260 --> 02:22:21.260]  I got my shit together.
[02:22:21.260 --> 02:22:23.620]  I'm taking care of business.
[02:22:23.620 --> 02:22:31.100]  I'm landing on the battleship or the transport right after a battle like, yeah, she's badass.
[02:22:31.100 --> 02:22:34.100]  She makes a bit more sense to me than Han does.
[02:22:34.100 --> 02:22:39.140]  Although I can see Han being the kind of stubborn idiot that would still be getting himself
[02:22:39.140 --> 02:22:41.900]  into those kind of situations in his 70s.
[02:22:41.900 --> 02:22:42.900]  Right.
[02:22:42.900 --> 02:22:45.020]  He's got like a self-destructive streak.
[02:22:45.020 --> 02:22:46.020]  Yeah.
[02:22:46.020 --> 02:22:50.860]  Well, how'd that work out, Amy?
[02:22:50.860 --> 02:22:53.340]  Shut up.
[02:22:53.340 --> 02:22:54.980]  We're not going to talk about it.
[02:22:54.980 --> 02:22:55.980]  You know what, though?
[02:22:55.980 --> 02:22:57.740]  This felt so cathartic to get it out.
[02:22:57.740 --> 02:22:58.740]  Oh, that's good.
[02:22:58.740 --> 02:22:59.740]  Okay.
[02:22:59.740 --> 02:23:01.740]  Because I, I can't talk about it on Twitter.
[02:23:01.740 --> 02:23:04.100]  And like, everybody is like, Star Wars is so amazing.
[02:23:04.100 --> 02:23:07.620]  And I just want to scream, screw you, Han Solo's dead.
[02:23:07.620 --> 02:23:08.700]  Give it a week or something.
[02:23:08.700 --> 02:23:12.780]  So will you, will you go see the movie again now?
[02:23:12.780 --> 02:23:18.020]  I feel like maybe I need another week, but it's, it's mellowing.
[02:23:18.020 --> 02:23:21.740]  I texted my best friend, like when it happened and I was like, did you see it?
[02:23:21.740 --> 02:23:23.020]  And thank God she said yes.
[02:23:23.020 --> 02:23:25.780]  And I was like, Oh my God, I'm inconsolable.
[02:23:25.780 --> 02:23:27.440]  And she was like, you know what you should do?
[02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:29.020]  You should watch Empire.
[02:23:29.020 --> 02:23:31.460]  That'll make you feel better if you watch Empire Strikes Back.
[02:23:31.460 --> 02:23:34.300]  And she's like, and just know that he really wanted out.
[02:23:34.300 --> 02:23:36.940]  Like he, he's, he's always wanted out.
[02:23:36.940 --> 02:23:39.180]  And so like, he's happy now.
[02:23:39.180 --> 02:23:40.180]  And that helped.
[02:23:40.180 --> 02:23:41.580]  It helped a little.
[02:23:41.580 --> 02:23:43.340]  Guy, did you see it in 3D?
[02:23:43.340 --> 02:23:44.340]  Or did you see it in 2D?
[02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:45.340]  I did.
[02:23:45.340 --> 02:23:46.340]  All three times.
[02:23:46.340 --> 02:23:47.340]  Really?
[02:23:47.340 --> 02:23:48.340]  I see.
[02:23:48.340 --> 02:23:49.340]  I don't like 3D.
[02:23:49.340 --> 02:23:50.340]  So I didn't.
[02:23:50.340 --> 02:23:51.340]  I haven't seen it in 3D yet.
[02:23:51.340 --> 02:23:52.340]  But I heard that 3D for this was pretty good.
[02:23:52.340 --> 02:23:54.340]  It wasn't like typical dark.
[02:23:54.340 --> 02:23:58.220]  Now that I've seen it twice, I'm thinking maybe I will see it if I go see it a third
[02:23:58.220 --> 02:23:59.220]  time.
[02:23:59.220 --> 02:24:00.220]  Well, I will.
[02:24:00.220 --> 02:24:03.340]  But I think maybe I should go see it in 3D while it's in theaters.
[02:24:03.340 --> 02:24:05.520]  I, oh, definitely.
[02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:07.100]  Do not do 3D like at home.
[02:24:07.100 --> 02:24:08.100]  Yeah.
[02:24:08.100 --> 02:24:09.100]  I'm going to go try to see it in 2D.
[02:24:09.100 --> 02:24:10.100]  But.
[02:24:10.100 --> 02:24:11.100]  Yeah, you should see it.
[02:24:11.100 --> 02:24:15.460]  I'm interested to hear if you saw it in 2D, because then I also I read that 3D is not
[02:24:15.460 --> 02:24:16.460]  bad.
[02:24:16.460 --> 02:24:17.460]  Like we have seen so many bad movies in 3D.
[02:24:17.460 --> 02:24:18.460]  Oh, no, no.
[02:24:18.460 --> 02:24:19.460]  This is a good one.
[02:24:19.460 --> 02:24:23.380]  But then I've heard, too, that in 3D wasn't that different.
[02:24:23.380 --> 02:24:24.700]  That it wasn't like...
[02:24:24.700 --> 02:24:29.180]  I believe that because it's not over the top.
[02:24:29.180 --> 02:24:34.820]  There's maybe one shot that I think is a bit extreme.
[02:24:34.820 --> 02:24:43.900]  And there's like a... so this is a shot of a Star Destroyer on the screen, like an establishing
[02:24:43.900 --> 02:24:44.900]  shot.
[02:24:44.900 --> 02:24:48.180]  And in 3D, it's like in your face, like right up there.
[02:24:48.180 --> 02:24:50.540]  I don't know what it looks like in 2D.
[02:24:50.540 --> 02:24:52.060]  Well, maybe I'll try it.
[02:24:52.060 --> 02:24:53.460]  We'll let the healing begin.
[02:24:53.460 --> 02:24:54.460]  Maybe I'm ready.
[02:24:54.460 --> 02:24:55.460]  Yeah.
[02:24:55.460 --> 02:24:58.060]  So, yeah, I do plan to see it in 2D.
[02:24:58.060 --> 02:24:59.540]  But you know, you can't.
[02:24:59.540 --> 02:25:04.620]  I mean, you got to go see it in 3D when it's in the studio, because they did not phone
[02:25:04.620 --> 02:25:05.620]  this in.
[02:25:05.620 --> 02:25:08.220]  I think it's a, you know, they did a good job.
[02:25:08.220 --> 02:25:09.220]  All right.
[02:25:09.220 --> 02:25:11.780]  And like you, I am not a 3D guy.
[02:25:11.780 --> 02:25:15.140]  Any final thoughts that you want to say before we wrap things up?
[02:25:15.140 --> 02:25:18.580]  I'm sorry, Amy, that Han Solo had to die.
[02:25:18.580 --> 02:25:20.740]  I appreciate your sympathy.
[02:25:20.740 --> 02:25:22.340]  All right, here's a question.
[02:25:22.340 --> 02:25:26.100]  Do you think Chewbacca is going to remain a major character?
[02:25:26.100 --> 02:25:28.340]  Or does he drop down to be like a peripheral character?
[02:25:28.340 --> 02:25:29.340]  No, no.
[02:25:29.340 --> 02:25:33.740]  Chewbacca is going to be the... he's attached to right now.
[02:25:33.740 --> 02:25:34.740]  Right.
[02:25:34.740 --> 02:25:35.740]  Oh, yeah.
[02:25:35.740 --> 02:25:36.740]  Yeah.
[02:25:36.740 --> 02:25:37.740]  Rey and Chewie.
[02:25:37.740 --> 02:25:40.980]  Even if she trains, I think Rey and Chewie keep the Millennium Falcon.
[02:25:40.980 --> 02:25:41.980]  Of course.
[02:25:41.980 --> 02:25:45.220]  And I think he's going to have a special affinity for her, because he knew that Han had an affinity
[02:25:45.220 --> 02:25:46.220]  for her.
[02:25:46.220 --> 02:25:47.220]  Yeah.
[02:25:47.220 --> 02:25:48.220]  Oh, it's gonna be nice.
[02:25:48.220 --> 02:25:49.220]  Oh, see?
[02:25:49.220 --> 02:25:50.220]  That's too bad.
[02:25:50.220 --> 02:25:51.500]  Chewie kind of likes you.
[02:25:51.500 --> 02:25:57.220]  In a sense, the thing that occurred to me is that the job offer that Han offered her
[02:25:57.220 --> 02:26:02.580]  to come on, you know, come on board the Millennium Falcon with Chewie, she ended up taking it.
[02:26:02.580 --> 02:26:04.460]  You know, Han's just not there to...
[02:26:04.460 --> 02:26:07.140]  How great is it, though, that she like turned it down at first?
[02:26:07.140 --> 02:26:08.540]  I love her.
[02:26:08.540 --> 02:26:09.540]  Yeah.
[02:26:09.540 --> 02:26:10.540]  Yeah, she's awesome.
[02:26:10.540 --> 02:26:12.940]  Well, she's got to get back to Jakku.
[02:26:12.940 --> 02:26:20.620]  And I love that Finn's like, why, why do people want to go back to that planet?
[02:26:20.620 --> 02:26:22.260]  What is going on with you?
[02:26:22.260 --> 02:26:24.700]  Do you know what?
[02:26:24.700 --> 02:26:28.660]  We didn't even talk about like my, one of my favorite parts where she's like, stop grabbing
[02:26:28.660 --> 02:26:29.660]  my hand.
[02:26:29.660 --> 02:26:30.660]  Yeah, I love, yeah.
[02:26:30.660 --> 02:26:31.980]  I loved that part.
[02:26:31.980 --> 02:26:33.700]  I thought that was so great.
[02:26:33.700 --> 02:26:34.700]  Yeah.
[02:26:34.700 --> 02:26:35.700]  Stop.
[02:26:35.700 --> 02:26:36.700]  Why are you grabbing my hand?
[02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:43.380]  I loved her like independent streak of Princess Leia, but yet she's got like, the mechanical
[02:26:43.380 --> 02:26:48.260]  skills that are usually reserved for men in these movies, like, still fantastic.
[02:26:48.260 --> 02:26:54.460]  I have to admit, J.J. Abrams totally suckered me in with the first scene where her and Finn
[02:26:54.460 --> 02:26:56.620]  meet in the market.
[02:26:56.620 --> 02:27:01.620]  And the guys who were told, hey, steal that droid from her are attacking her and you cut
[02:27:01.620 --> 02:27:02.620]  to Finn.
[02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:07.220]  And you see, it's like, this is where like, in the moment, Finn, you can say he's out
[02:27:07.220 --> 02:27:09.180]  for himself, but he's going to help her.
[02:27:09.180 --> 02:27:11.780]  And then I was totally like, oh, I get it.
[02:27:11.780 --> 02:27:13.060]  He doesn't know it from Abram.
[02:27:13.060 --> 02:27:15.500]  It's just like, okay, this girl's in trouble, I'm gonna...
[02:27:15.500 --> 02:27:21.640]  And instead, I was totally suckered in, as J.J. Abrams intended me to be, that thinking
[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:26.540]  he's going to rescue her, and the next thing you know, he's like, oh, and she's kicked
[02:27:26.540 --> 02:27:28.420]  all three guys' asses.
[02:27:28.420 --> 02:27:34.020]  And she's like, unscathed, and it's like, oh, this is a different type of movie.
[02:27:34.020 --> 02:27:43.540]  And then BB-8's like, hey, that guy's got the jacket, and he's like, oh, wait, what?
[02:27:43.540 --> 02:27:44.540]  You're right, you're right.
[02:27:44.540 --> 02:27:49.040]  Because then immediately, not only are you surprised that she didn't need to be rescued,
[02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:53.260]  but immediately, she's like, got him on his ass and is like, all right, give us back the
[02:27:53.260 --> 02:27:54.260]  jacket.
[02:27:54.260 --> 02:27:57.060]  Like, that's the next target, yeah.
[02:27:57.060 --> 02:28:03.900]  And BB-8 keeps electrocuting him.
[02:28:03.900 --> 02:28:04.900]  I don't know.
[02:28:04.900 --> 02:28:05.900]  So great.
[02:28:05.900 --> 02:28:06.900]  Such a great female character.
[02:28:06.900 --> 02:28:08.180]  And it never felt gratuitous.
[02:28:08.180 --> 02:28:12.220]  Like, it never felt like, okay, now we're doing something, you know, so the girls won't
[02:28:12.220 --> 02:28:13.220]  complain.
[02:28:13.220 --> 02:28:14.780]  Like, truly a great character.
[02:28:14.780 --> 02:28:17.860]  No, no, none of that at all.
[02:28:17.860 --> 02:28:24.220]  Not even like, there's not sexualized, there's not even, there's like, like, mild romance,
[02:28:24.220 --> 02:28:26.220]  but not even, like,
[02:28:26.220 --> 02:28:27.220]  right.
[02:28:27.220 --> 02:28:28.220]  Yeah.
[02:28:28.220 --> 02:28:29.220]  Star Wars-y.
[02:28:29.220 --> 02:28:30.220]  Star Wars-y.
[02:28:30.220 --> 02:28:31.220]  Very Star Wars-y.
[02:28:31.220 --> 02:28:33.900]  Yeah, but Star Wars-y had, I mean, they kept it to a kiss, but.
[02:28:33.900 --> 02:28:34.900]  Yeah.
[02:28:34.900 --> 02:28:37.140]  Even less than the original Star Wars, I'd say.
[02:28:37.140 --> 02:28:38.140]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:28:38.140 --> 02:28:42.340]  It makes me want to, we should have more children and like, have a girl, because I just want
[02:28:42.340 --> 02:28:43.340]  her to see this movie.
[02:28:43.340 --> 02:28:44.340]  Okay.
[02:28:44.340 --> 02:28:47.340]  Oh, wait, sorry, not me.
[02:28:47.340 --> 02:28:48.340]  Okay.
[02:28:48.340 --> 02:28:52.780]  All right, Guy English, thank you for doing this.
[02:28:52.780 --> 02:28:55.660]  My apologies to the special guests who did not.
[02:28:55.660 --> 02:28:59.780]  We're going to have to cut it short, so my apologies to everybody waiting in the green
[02:28:59.780 --> 02:29:00.780]  room.
[02:29:00.780 --> 02:29:01.780]  Yeah.
[02:29:01.780 --> 02:29:02.780]  Peace, Ben Thompson.
[02:29:02.780 --> 02:29:28.820]  Thanks for watching our child.
