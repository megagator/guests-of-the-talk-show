[00:00.000 --> 00:04.160]  You really want to talk about Cubs baseball though, right?
[00:04.160 --> 00:06.960]  That's why we're here, Chicago Cubs 2015 National League
[00:06.960 --> 00:08.360]  Champs.
[00:08.360 --> 00:11.940]  I got to tell you, I am delighted to have
[00:11.940 --> 00:14.680]  Joe Madden out of the AL East.
[00:14.680 --> 00:19.400]  That guy, I think he's the best manager in baseball.
[00:19.400 --> 00:20.840]  I really do.
[00:20.840 --> 00:27.800]  Well, I heard similar things about Don Baylor, Dusty Baker,
[00:27.800 --> 00:31.240]  and Lou Piniella before they signed down with the Cubs too.
[00:31.240 --> 00:34.440]  Sweet Lou was a good manager, I think.
[00:34.440 --> 00:39.160]  I mean, he's got a certain style and intensity.
[00:39.160 --> 00:41.840]  But he was a good manager with the Yankees.
[00:41.840 --> 00:45.040]  I thought he was a good manager with Seattle.
[00:45.040 --> 00:47.720]  He did actually succeed fairly well with the Cubs,
[00:47.720 --> 00:51.080]  but they also, not every year.
[00:51.080 --> 00:53.040]  Well, they were better than the Cubs usually are,
[00:53.040 --> 00:55.240]  but they never got up to good.
[00:55.240 --> 00:57.320]  No.
[00:57.320 --> 01:01.440]  It hurt me because Lou Piniella, unless my memory is really
[01:01.440 --> 01:06.720]  shot, he was managing Seattle in 95, the year
[01:06.720 --> 01:10.640]  right before the Yankees started their dynasty.
[01:10.640 --> 01:12.520]  The year I had a Mariners hat.
[01:12.520 --> 01:13.240]  Right.
[01:13.240 --> 01:16.120]  And it was Mattingly's last season,
[01:16.120 --> 01:18.400]  and the first time he got in the postseason.
[01:18.400 --> 01:21.840]  And he played, Mattingly played great.
[01:21.840 --> 01:25.520]  He had a great series, but the Mariners won.
[01:25.520 --> 01:28.400]  And it just was salt in the wound that it was Yankee
[01:28.400 --> 01:30.400]  legend Lou Piniella at the helm.
[01:30.400 --> 01:32.800]  Well, we'll see.
[01:32.800 --> 01:34.800]  I'm actually going to CES for the first time.
[01:34.800 --> 01:36.340]  I remember this is something we talked
[01:36.340 --> 01:38.000]  about either a year or two ago.
[01:38.000 --> 01:38.600]  Yeah, totally.
[01:38.600 --> 01:40.680]  So I might actually put a little money on the Cubs.
[01:40.680 --> 01:41.280]  We'll see.
[01:41.280 --> 01:43.040]  Oh, yeah, you got to do that.
[01:43.040 --> 01:44.080]  All right, I'm going to.
[01:44.080 --> 01:45.520]  You got to make a prop bet.
[01:45.520 --> 01:46.880]  All right, we're going to do it.
[01:46.880 --> 01:49.200]  Prop bets are fun for two reasons.
[01:49.200 --> 01:50.400]  One, you get great odds.
[01:50.400 --> 01:51.840]  I don't know what the Cubs are at,
[01:51.840 --> 01:54.320]  but I'll bet they're probably like 15 to 1 at least,
[01:54.320 --> 01:54.960]  maybe more.
[01:54.960 --> 01:56.520]  Something I don't even know.
[01:56.520 --> 01:58.280]  Number two, you have the challenge
[01:58.280 --> 02:03.160]  of keeping track of that little piece of paper for nine months.
[02:03.160 --> 02:06.000]  And it's like, I don't even think they print them
[02:06.000 --> 02:07.400]  on super high quality.
[02:07.400 --> 02:11.640]  It's like that heat transfer, like regular paper receipts
[02:11.640 --> 02:14.480]  you get from retail stores.
[02:14.480 --> 02:16.560]  And if you leave it out in the sun or something,
[02:16.560 --> 02:17.680]  it'll fade to nothing.
[02:17.680 --> 02:18.680]  Or in your wallet for.
[02:18.680 --> 02:21.400]  Yeah, because the heat.
[02:21.400 --> 02:23.160]  And I find that so weird, because you
[02:23.160 --> 02:26.000]  would think a casino, I guess it's
[02:26.000 --> 02:29.520]  because they don't lose if you destroy your ticket, but.
[02:29.520 --> 02:30.520]  Breakage.
[02:30.520 --> 02:31.520]  Yeah, because I.
[02:31.520 --> 02:35.120]  There we go, there's our Kickstarter, Casino Receipts
[02:35.120 --> 02:37.360]  Preserver Kit.
[02:37.360 --> 02:40.400]  Yeah, print them on inkjet or something.
[02:40.400 --> 02:42.360]  Something's going to last.
[02:42.360 --> 02:45.560]  You should get good odds on that.
[02:45.560 --> 02:48.040]  When did you decide to go to CES?
[02:48.040 --> 02:49.100]  A few weeks ago.
[02:49.100 --> 02:52.400]  It was presented as an option for me here at Quartz,
[02:52.400 --> 02:53.640]  and I've never been.
[02:53.640 --> 02:57.200]  And I figured this is the perfect year to go,
[02:57.200 --> 03:00.800]  when I have the name of a big news agency behind me
[03:00.800 --> 03:02.720]  to get good meetings and that kind of stuff,
[03:02.720 --> 03:06.160]  but also work for a site that doesn't churn out
[03:06.160 --> 03:08.040]  hundreds of stories a day.
[03:08.040 --> 03:11.720]  So I won't have to file an article every half an hour.
[03:11.720 --> 03:13.360]  Yeah, that sounds like the way to do it.
[03:13.360 --> 03:14.600]  Yeah, it's going to be great.
[03:14.600 --> 03:15.800]  It's a perennial topic.
[03:15.800 --> 03:18.640]  It's like my second week of January topic
[03:18.640 --> 03:21.040]  every year on this show is, boy, I
[03:21.040 --> 03:23.600]  thought last year I should maybe go to CES.
[03:23.600 --> 03:25.240]  One of these years I got to go, and I
[03:25.240 --> 03:26.480]  didn't do it this year again.
[03:26.480 --> 03:28.120]  Yeah, I think that was us last year.
[03:28.120 --> 03:29.760]  I do it every year.
[03:29.760 --> 03:30.960]  I have the same thought.
[03:30.960 --> 03:32.520]  Well, I'll let you know how it is.
[03:32.520 --> 03:36.800]  And it's one of those things where my natural inclination
[03:36.800 --> 03:40.560]  towards procrastination just fails, because it's really,
[03:40.560 --> 03:41.980]  you can't do it at the last, well,
[03:41.980 --> 03:43.520]  you could do it at the last minute,
[03:43.520 --> 03:44.960]  but it's super expensive.
[03:44.960 --> 03:46.760]  Yeah, and it's kind of annoying.
[03:46.760 --> 03:49.600]  They make you book your hotels through their centralized
[03:49.600 --> 03:53.200]  system, and the flights are expensive or sold out.
[03:53.200 --> 03:56.320]  So even when I booked a month and a half out,
[03:56.320 --> 03:58.400]  it was still kind of annoying.
[03:58.400 --> 04:00.440]  But anyway, it's going to be awesome.
[04:00.440 --> 04:03.000]  I'll bet there's a ton of people from New York who could go.
[04:03.000 --> 04:04.040]  Yes, yeah, yeah.
[04:04.040 --> 04:05.040]  Yeah.
[04:05.040 --> 04:08.840]  I think if you lived in Joe Random City,
[04:08.840 --> 04:10.800]  I'll bet Philadelphia's Vegas flights probably
[04:10.800 --> 04:13.120]  aren't that different that week, because I
[04:13.120 --> 04:15.520]  bet there's not that many people from here that go.
[04:15.520 --> 04:17.440]  But the hotels are a mess.
[04:17.440 --> 04:18.840]  Yeah.
[04:18.840 --> 04:20.480]  I can't wait to hear your report.
[04:20.480 --> 04:21.640]  Yeah, it's going to be great.
[04:21.640 --> 04:23.220]  No, and I totally think that's the way
[04:23.220 --> 04:26.020]  to do it, is to do it as a publication that
[04:26.020 --> 04:29.600]  has a measured tone, not a bombardment of we
[04:29.600 --> 04:31.000]  got to have 30 posts a day.
[04:31.000 --> 04:31.960]  And you know.
[04:31.960 --> 04:32.720]  Yeah, it's funny.
[04:32.720 --> 04:35.660]  I was talking to someone from a large consumer electronics
[04:35.660 --> 04:37.320]  company the other day, and they're like,
[04:37.320 --> 04:39.360]  so are you coming to our press conference?
[04:39.360 --> 04:41.120]  Are you coming to our media day?
[04:41.120 --> 04:41.960]  And I'm like, nope.
[04:41.960 --> 04:44.760]  I'm not even getting there until Tuesday
[04:44.760 --> 04:48.000]  after all that crap has already happened.
[04:48.000 --> 04:49.760]  That's the way to do it.
[04:49.760 --> 04:55.800]  So no waiting in line for stupid whatever they're going to show.
[04:55.800 --> 04:59.560]  Big TVs and home automation stuff, probably,
[04:59.560 --> 05:00.360]  I have no idea.
[05:00.360 --> 05:01.600]  Yeah, that's a good question.
[05:01.600 --> 05:04.060]  I wonder what the big thing will be.
[05:04.060 --> 05:05.360]  TVs are always the thing.
[05:05.360 --> 05:06.960]  I think my sense is, yeah, I mean,
[05:06.960 --> 05:09.480]  TVs, but my sense is that this is the year
[05:09.480 --> 05:12.160]  that all the connected home stuff starts to gel.
[05:12.160 --> 05:19.760]  So home automation stuff and refrigerators
[05:19.760 --> 05:22.320]  that talk to your pet, that kind of stuff.
[05:22.320 --> 05:23.600]  Watches have got to be huge.
[05:23.600 --> 05:24.920]  Oh, yeah, watches too.
[05:24.920 --> 05:30.740]  Because A, and Apple Watch aside, Android Wear is out.
[05:30.740 --> 05:32.240]  It's a real thing.
[05:32.240 --> 05:35.800]  And it's already starting to accelerate.
[05:35.800 --> 05:38.440]  When they first announced it back at I.O. in June,
[05:38.440 --> 05:42.280]  there were two watches, and they both were really clanky.
[05:42.280 --> 05:44.840]  I mean, they sucked.
[05:44.840 --> 05:48.280]  Then the Moto 360, or as I call it, the 270, hit.
[05:48.280 --> 05:50.400]  And now there's been a trickle of watches
[05:50.400 --> 05:52.880]  that seem reasonable.
[05:52.880 --> 05:56.880]  They seem like something that people might want to consider.
[05:56.880 --> 05:57.640]  Yeah, we'll see.
[05:57.640 --> 06:00.020]  That'll be interesting.
[06:00.020 --> 06:04.280]  I've gotten a few pitches on shirts
[06:04.280 --> 06:07.160]  that have sensors built in so you can measure your heart
[06:07.160 --> 06:09.240]  rate through your shirt.
[06:09.240 --> 06:10.880]  So we'll see about that.
[06:10.880 --> 06:12.360]  Yeah, because the other thing that I
[06:12.360 --> 06:13.760]  think makes it have to be watches
[06:13.760 --> 06:16.000]  is then going back to Apple Watch,
[06:16.000 --> 06:18.320]  with Apple Watch on the horizon.
[06:18.320 --> 06:20.640]  And we're clearly not going to hear anything new
[06:20.640 --> 06:23.240]  about Apple Watch before CES.
[06:23.240 --> 06:25.480]  Right, and probably not during either,
[06:25.480 --> 06:29.240]  unless they do one of those silly Apple leak type things.
[06:29.240 --> 06:31.320]  But that means any consumer electronics company
[06:31.320 --> 06:36.500]  that wants to bet on smartwatches because Apple,
[06:36.500 --> 06:39.560]  you know, betting on what Apple is interested in
[06:39.560 --> 06:41.960]  is a pretty good way forward.
[06:41.960 --> 06:44.520]  They're going to want to get that stuff out before,
[06:44.520 --> 06:45.360]  as soon as they can.
[06:45.360 --> 06:48.040]  Right, so this is HP's chance to show off
[06:48.040 --> 06:51.840]  the slate in Steve Ballmer's last keynote or whatever.
[06:51.840 --> 06:54.600]  Right.
[06:54.600 --> 06:56.040]  Sweet, yeah.
[06:56.040 --> 06:58.560]  I have a little bit of follow-up from previous episodes
[06:58.560 --> 07:02.080]  of this broadcast.
[07:02.080 --> 07:03.920]  Star Wars follow-up?
[07:03.920 --> 07:05.420]  A little bit of Star Wars follow-up.
[07:05.420 --> 07:07.880]  I have to go all the way back to the Merlin episode, which
[07:07.880 --> 07:10.800]  was 99, episode 99?
[07:10.800 --> 07:12.440]  Yeah, that was four episodes ago.
[07:12.440 --> 07:16.080]  So we talked about Roman numerals in the Super Bowl.
[07:16.080 --> 07:18.360]  And then in a subsequent week followed up
[07:18.360 --> 07:21.840]  that they are, the NFL is indeed dropping the Roman numerals
[07:21.840 --> 07:25.880]  for not this year's Super Bowl, next year's 50,
[07:25.880 --> 07:30.140]  which would have been just L. And that looks stupid.
[07:30.140 --> 07:32.780]  So they're just going to put Super Bowl 5-0,
[07:32.780 --> 07:34.480]  and I was happy.
[07:34.480 --> 07:36.880]  But it ends up they're only doing that for Super Bowl
[07:36.880 --> 07:39.220]  50, because L looks so stupid.
[07:39.220 --> 07:40.720]  Starting with Super Bowl 51, they're
[07:40.720 --> 07:43.080]  going back to the stupid Roman numerals.
[07:43.080 --> 07:45.320]  So bad news on the Roman numeral front.
[07:48.320 --> 07:50.040]  Star Wars?
[07:50.040 --> 07:52.480]  No, I don't think I have any follow-up on Star Wars.
[07:52.480 --> 07:55.040]  Although there was, I saw a really funny bit
[07:55.040 --> 08:00.280]  from Stephen Colbert defending the new Sith lightsaber.
[08:00.280 --> 08:00.960]  Oh, nice.
[08:00.960 --> 08:04.380]  I'll put it in the show notes, but it's really, really funny.
[08:04.380 --> 08:05.560]  What did you think of it?
[08:05.560 --> 08:09.040]  Well, I don't really know much about Star Wars.
[08:09.040 --> 08:09.800]  What?
[08:09.800 --> 08:10.400]  I know.
[08:10.400 --> 08:12.560]  I'm sorry.
[08:12.560 --> 08:15.680]  Although, so my first exposures, I don't know.
[08:15.680 --> 08:18.560]  My dad showed me Caddyshack and those types of movies instead.
[08:18.560 --> 08:21.000]  So we were like a Zappa household,
[08:21.000 --> 08:26.480]  not a Beatles household.
[08:26.480 --> 08:28.920]  But the first time I ever saw Star Wars
[08:28.920 --> 08:32.580]  was when they re-released them in the mid-'90s on probably
[08:32.580 --> 08:35.100]  the biggest screen that existed in Chicago
[08:35.100 --> 08:36.800]  at that point at this movie theater
[08:36.800 --> 08:38.440]  downtown called McClurg Court.
[08:38.440 --> 08:42.560]  That was like five times bigger than any other movie screen.
[08:42.560 --> 08:45.600]  So that was kind of cool, and we went and saw those.
[08:45.600 --> 08:49.840]  And I've still never seen Jedi.
[08:49.840 --> 08:50.320]  I'm bad.
[08:50.320 --> 08:52.760]  I need to do this at some point.
[08:52.760 --> 08:53.600]  That's crazy.
[08:53.600 --> 08:55.880]  Sorry, I sound like an idiot now.
[08:55.880 --> 08:59.240]  Anyway, I don't know what I was going to say,
[08:59.240 --> 09:02.200]  but I thought the new lightsaber looks fine.
[09:02.200 --> 09:03.000]  That's crazy.
[09:03.000 --> 09:04.160]  You don't have an opinion.
[09:04.160 --> 09:05.360]  Your opinion does not count.
[09:05.360 --> 09:06.240]  No, it does not count.
[09:06.240 --> 09:07.000]  I have no opinion.
[09:07.000 --> 09:10.440]  All right, the other bit of follow-up,
[09:10.440 --> 09:12.400]  and this is really minutia, but why not?
[09:12.400 --> 09:16.280]  Let's be precise, is in last week's episode with Whiskas,
[09:16.280 --> 09:18.640]  we were talking about Bond movies.
[09:18.640 --> 09:24.640]  And I brought up that the Lazenby one on Her Majesty's
[09:24.640 --> 09:27.440]  Secret Service, Dave was under the impression
[09:27.440 --> 09:29.980]  that it was universally, everybody hated it,
[09:29.980 --> 09:31.320]  everybody knew it was a mistake.
[09:31.320 --> 09:34.440]  It turns out, I am correct on this, that it's very divisive.
[09:34.440 --> 09:38.080]  Most people seem not to like it and agree it was a dud,
[09:38.080 --> 09:41.320]  but there's a fairly sizable contingent of Bond movie
[09:41.320 --> 09:44.040]  fans who either think it's their favorite or one
[09:44.040 --> 09:46.600]  of their favorites, one of the better ones.
[09:46.600 --> 09:47.960]  I have not seen that one.
[09:47.960 --> 09:50.240]  What is polarizing about it?
[09:50.240 --> 09:56.920]  Well, I think it's a weird story.
[09:56.920 --> 10:00.880]  I think Lazenby's take on the character was off.
[10:00.880 --> 10:03.120]  I just don't buy him as Bond.
[10:03.120 --> 10:06.760]  Other people think he's great, though.
[10:06.760 --> 10:09.640]  He's definitely not Sean Connery, that's for sure.
[10:09.640 --> 10:11.780]  And I don't know.
[10:11.780 --> 10:13.360]  And there's something about the story,
[10:13.360 --> 10:15.920]  the way the story is written, that I just think it's a dud.
[10:15.920 --> 10:19.080]  But some people really like the direction.
[10:19.080 --> 10:21.440]  Some people think the action sequences
[10:21.440 --> 10:25.840]  are some of the best of that era.
[10:25.840 --> 10:27.880]  And I think his name is Peter Hunt.
[10:27.880 --> 10:34.060]  And in the earlier movies, he was the editor of the movies.
[10:34.060 --> 10:35.600]  And he got to direct this one.
[10:35.600 --> 10:38.560]  And some people think that that helped make the action
[10:38.560 --> 10:40.440]  sequences better, because he knew
[10:40.440 --> 10:43.720]  how to shoot them to give the editing the footage that they
[10:43.720 --> 10:47.080]  would need, that an editor's perspective on directing
[10:47.080 --> 10:48.840]  makes for better action sequences.
[10:48.840 --> 10:49.560]  Film Crit Hulk.
[10:49.560 --> 10:51.280]  Do you ever read Film Crit Hulk?
[10:51.280 --> 10:53.120]  I don't, but I am aware of it.
[10:53.120 --> 10:55.960]  And I appreciate its existence.
[10:55.960 --> 10:56.960]  He's a big fan.
[10:56.960 --> 10:59.040]  He did a thing where he wrote about all the Bond movies.
[10:59.040 --> 10:59.640]  And he really liked it.
[10:59.640 --> 11:00.160]  Oh, cool.
[11:00.160 --> 11:03.680]  Anyway, friend of the show, Nat Irons.
[11:03.680 --> 11:05.480]  I think he's at Nat Irons on Twitter.
[11:05.480 --> 11:06.640]  Great guy.
[11:06.640 --> 11:07.600]  Works at Black Pixel.
[11:07.600 --> 11:08.340]  Really smart guy.
[11:08.340 --> 11:09.500]  Long time friend of the show.
[11:09.500 --> 11:11.520]  Long time daring fireball reader.
[11:11.520 --> 11:14.160]  I mean, back in 2002, this guy who
[11:14.160 --> 11:16.480]  sent me typos and stuff like that.
[11:16.480 --> 11:17.500]  Great guy.
[11:17.500 --> 11:19.560]  I said it was his favorite Bond movie.
[11:19.560 --> 11:21.640]  And in fact, he corrected me on Twitter
[11:21.640 --> 11:23.240]  and said it is in his top six.
[11:23.240 --> 11:25.760]  He is a fan of the movie, but he would not
[11:25.760 --> 11:26.720]  call it his favorite.
[11:26.720 --> 11:29.520]  And I wouldn't want to besmirch somebody in such a way.
[11:29.520 --> 11:33.200]  So let's clear the record for Nat.
[11:33.200 --> 11:36.520]  Oh, and the last thing, Whiskas made a mistake.
[11:36.520 --> 11:40.480]  The Chris Cornell song, I forget the name of it,
[11:40.480 --> 11:42.240]  but it was the theme of, it was not
[11:42.240 --> 11:44.200]  the theme of Quantum of Solace.
[11:44.200 --> 11:48.640]  That was the theme for Casino Royale.
[11:48.640 --> 11:50.520]  And I don't know, I was tired or something.
[11:50.520 --> 11:51.160]  Let it slide.
[11:51.160 --> 11:54.560]  I didn't catch it when Whiskas made that mistake.
[11:54.560 --> 11:57.240]  The theme for Quantum of Solace was the Jack White one,
[11:57.240 --> 12:00.200]  which was kind of weird.
[12:00.200 --> 12:01.000]  You've watched.
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.280]  Yeah, I haven't seen that one for a while, though.
[12:03.280 --> 12:04.700]  I've been watching the old ones.
[12:04.700 --> 12:06.040]  You have seen James Bond movies.
[12:06.040 --> 12:06.700]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[12:06.700 --> 12:09.360]  I've been watching the old ones.
[12:09.360 --> 12:11.840]  I'd started seeing all the new ones as they'd come out,
[12:11.840 --> 12:13.160]  and I'd never seen the old ones.
[12:13.160 --> 12:16.600]  And then after you and Dan started doing the shows,
[12:16.600 --> 12:17.560]  I started watching them.
[12:17.560 --> 12:21.880]  And actually, as you know, they're so annoying to stream,
[12:21.880 --> 12:23.800]  so I've had to end up buying a bunch of them.
[12:23.800 --> 12:26.360]  But yeah, I dig them.
[12:26.360 --> 12:28.120]  The streaming rights on those Bond movies
[12:28.120 --> 12:29.960]  are the craziest thing in the world.
[12:29.960 --> 12:32.560]  Somebody twittered me the other day that a bunch of the Connery
[12:32.560 --> 12:35.920]  ones are back on Netflix, but they're not all of them.
[12:35.920 --> 12:39.480]  No, and I think a bunch were on HBO Go,
[12:39.480 --> 12:41.060]  which is where I watched one recently.
[12:41.060 --> 12:41.860]  But not all of them.
[12:41.860 --> 12:44.160]  Not all of them, and not the ones I wanted to watch.
[12:44.160 --> 12:47.080]  So I was like, well, OK.
[12:47.080 --> 12:49.300]  Yeah, who knows what those negotiations are like.
[12:49.300 --> 12:50.340]  But you would just think, though,
[12:50.340 --> 12:52.160]  that it would be like a blanket deal.
[12:52.160 --> 12:53.760]  Because they're all one company?
[12:53.760 --> 12:57.680]  Yeah, all except for Never Say Never Again,
[12:57.680 --> 13:00.920]  which is an entirely separate long story about how it exists.
[13:00.920 --> 13:04.240]  But all the other Bond movies are from Eon Productions.
[13:04.240 --> 13:08.760]  Eon, the abbreviation, everything or nothing.
[13:08.760 --> 13:10.040]  So it's just bizarre.
[13:10.040 --> 13:13.520]  It must just be that, you know, that's.
[13:13.520 --> 13:17.200]  And which conglomerate owns those?
[13:17.200 --> 13:19.040]  Is it Sony or one of those?
[13:19.040 --> 13:21.640]  Who owns MGM now?
[13:21.640 --> 13:22.460]  I don't know.
[13:22.460 --> 13:23.640]  I don't know.
[13:23.640 --> 13:24.480]  Yeah.
[13:24.480 --> 13:26.040]  Well, but anyway, it's crazy.
[13:26.040 --> 13:26.960]  It's very frustrating.
[13:26.960 --> 13:28.400]  Now you'll have more follow up.
[13:28.400 --> 13:29.280]  Sorry, man.
[13:29.280 --> 13:33.960]  I think it's one of those things like a piece of buttered toast
[13:33.960 --> 13:35.400]  is always going to land face down.
[13:35.400 --> 13:37.760]  It's like whatever Bond movie you're in the mood to watch
[13:37.760 --> 13:40.160]  is always not going to be available for free on Netflix.
[13:40.160 --> 13:41.120]  Totally, yeah.
[13:41.120 --> 13:41.920]  Yeah.
[13:41.920 --> 13:43.760]  Actually, why don't I just take a break right here
[13:43.760 --> 13:45.600]  and do the first sponsor read.
[13:45.600 --> 13:47.920]  And then we'll get started on new stuff.
[13:47.920 --> 13:49.760]  And it's a brand new sponsor.
[13:49.760 --> 13:54.280]  I am very, very excited about this.
[13:54.280 --> 13:57.760]  It's called Hello, H-U-L-L-O, which
[13:57.760 --> 14:02.600]  I think is how Bilbo used to say hello in the Lord of the Rings
[14:02.600 --> 14:04.280]  movies.
[14:04.280 --> 14:09.280]  Have you ever tried a buckwheat hole pillow?
[14:09.280 --> 14:10.200]  Have you, Dan?
[14:10.200 --> 14:11.040]  No.
[14:11.040 --> 14:12.800]  Well, I never even heard of such a thing.
[14:12.800 --> 14:16.320]  But popular for centuries throughout Asia,
[14:16.320 --> 14:18.920]  buckwheat pillows conform to your body
[14:18.920 --> 14:22.200]  and provide cool, comfortable support.
[14:22.200 --> 14:24.560]  Hello suits every person's sleeping style.
[14:24.560 --> 14:28.120]  Are you a side sleeper, back sleeper, stomach sleeper?
[14:28.120 --> 14:31.160]  Hello can be adjusted to conform perfectly
[14:31.160 --> 14:32.680]  to the shape of your head and neck,
[14:32.680 --> 14:35.360]  providing ideal support that's just for you.
[14:35.360 --> 14:36.440]  I'm usually a back sleeper.
[14:36.440 --> 14:38.880]  I just sleep like I'm in a coffin.
[14:38.880 --> 14:41.840]  Sometimes I sleep on my stomach, though.
[14:41.840 --> 14:44.000]  Who knows how I wake up?
[14:44.000 --> 14:47.960]  Air flows freely through Hello's buckwheat hole fill,
[14:47.960 --> 14:50.640]  keeping it cool all night long.
[14:50.640 --> 14:52.680]  Adjust the thickness to your personal preference
[14:52.680 --> 14:55.800]  by adding or removing the holes any time.
[14:55.800 --> 14:59.320]  It's made in the USA with quality construction
[14:59.320 --> 15:02.880]  and materials and improves on traditional buckwheat pillows
[15:02.880 --> 15:07.120]  by incorporating only the highest quality materials.
[15:07.120 --> 15:12.400]  Pre-shrunken, durable twill cotton case, high quality
[15:12.400 --> 15:16.480]  Dunlap hidden zipper, and the buckwheat hole fill
[15:16.480 --> 15:20.720]  is grown and milled in North Dakota.
[15:20.720 --> 15:25.160]  It's organically friendly, environmentally friendly,
[15:25.160 --> 15:28.280]  I should say, organic product, no chemical-based foams
[15:28.280 --> 15:31.200]  or bird feathers, 100% unbleached,
[15:31.200 --> 15:34.200]  certified organic cotton.
[15:34.200 --> 15:37.040]  These guys sent me one of these, or actually two,
[15:37.040 --> 15:40.440]  so my wife and I could both try these out.
[15:40.440 --> 15:43.320]  And I opened it up, and I thought
[15:43.320 --> 15:45.160]  that they were out of their freaking minds,
[15:45.160 --> 15:48.440]  because it seemed as though it's like a pillow
[15:48.440 --> 15:50.560]  stuffed full of coffee beans.
[15:50.560 --> 15:53.320]  I mean, it is definitely not like a normal pillow.
[15:53.320 --> 15:56.480]  It is entirely different.
[15:56.480 --> 15:58.440]  It's not like, oh, wow, that's weird
[15:58.440 --> 16:01.680]  that a pillow full of holes, buckwheat holes,
[16:01.680 --> 16:02.720]  would feel like a pillow.
[16:02.720 --> 16:04.260]  It doesn't feel like a normal pillow.
[16:04.260 --> 16:08.000]  It's very heavy, much heavier, and it makes a crinkly sound.
[16:08.000 --> 16:11.320]  Definitely has a sound like you're sleeping on a bag,
[16:11.320 --> 16:13.720]  like I said, a bag full of coffee beans.
[16:13.720 --> 16:15.140]  Figured I'd try it out, though.
[16:15.140 --> 16:17.600]  And that was like two weeks ago, and I've still
[16:17.600 --> 16:18.480]  got it on my bed.
[16:18.480 --> 16:20.840]  It's pretty cool.
[16:20.840 --> 16:23.440]  I still wake up every morning, though, I still think, man,
[16:23.440 --> 16:24.400]  this pillow is wild.
[16:24.400 --> 16:25.120]  But I like it.
[16:25.120 --> 16:27.680]  It definitely gives me a better night's sleep
[16:27.680 --> 16:30.960]  than I had with a regular pillow.
[16:30.960 --> 16:32.880]  Not at all like memory foam.
[16:32.880 --> 16:35.920]  I don't really care for the memory foam pillows.
[16:35.920 --> 16:38.440]  They seem weird the way they conform to your head.
[16:38.440 --> 16:41.080]  This thing, the conforming to your head,
[16:41.080 --> 16:43.080]  it's not at all like foam or anything like that.
[16:43.080 --> 16:46.800]  It's just like sleeping on a bag of beans.
[16:46.800 --> 16:47.560]  I don't know.
[16:47.560 --> 16:48.520]  It's nature.
[16:48.520 --> 16:49.240]  Yeah.
[16:49.240 --> 16:50.680]  So here's the deal.
[16:50.680 --> 16:51.840]  Sounds crazy.
[16:51.840 --> 16:54.520]  It seems like a weird thing you'd buy off a podcast.
[16:54.520 --> 16:55.520]  But here's their deal.
[16:55.520 --> 16:58.920]  You try it for 60 nights, and if you're not satisfied,
[16:58.920 --> 17:02.960]  they will give you a full refund, no questions asked.
[17:02.960 --> 17:06.560]  So you can do this.
[17:06.560 --> 17:09.320]  The small ones are $49.
[17:09.320 --> 17:10.920]  Standard is $79.
[17:10.920 --> 17:12.560]  King size, $129.
[17:12.560 --> 17:14.360]  So they're not cheap, but you can save money
[17:14.360 --> 17:15.360]  on each additional one.
[17:15.360 --> 17:19.160]  You can save $5, $10, or $20 on each additional one
[17:19.160 --> 17:20.120]  that you buy.
[17:20.120 --> 17:25.000]  And it's 60 days, no risk, no questions asked, money back.
[17:25.000 --> 17:27.000]  So if you've got any curiosity in this,
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.840]  and you're thinking, man, it sounds crazy.
[17:29.840 --> 17:32.320]  Gruber says it works.
[17:32.320 --> 17:33.320]  Just go try it.
[17:33.320 --> 17:34.000]  Sign up.
[17:34.000 --> 17:35.200]  Buy the thing.
[17:35.200 --> 17:37.800]  And if you don't like it, just send it back to them for free.
[17:37.800 --> 17:39.480]  You don't have to pay a damn thing.
[17:39.480 --> 17:40.320]  So try it.
[17:40.320 --> 17:41.860]  Here's where you go to find out more.
[17:41.860 --> 17:50.440]  HelloPillow, H-U-L-L-O, Pillow, P-I-L-L-O-W dot com slash
[17:50.440 --> 17:53.520]  talk show, just slash talk show.
[17:53.520 --> 17:56.520]  And the last bit, 1% of all of their profits
[17:56.520 --> 18:00.320]  are contributed to The Nature Conservancy.
[18:00.320 --> 18:01.920]  So my thanks to HelloPillow.
[18:01.920 --> 18:03.360]  Give them a try.
[18:03.360 --> 18:04.840]  It's really crazy.
[18:04.840 --> 18:08.020]  I thought I was being pranked when I first opened the box.
[18:08.020 --> 18:09.100]  Sounds cool.
[18:09.100 --> 18:10.880]  Yeah, it works.
[18:10.880 --> 18:11.880]  Gluten free.
[18:11.880 --> 18:13.240]  First thing I want to talk about.
[18:13.240 --> 18:14.540]  I want to talk about this thing.
[18:14.540 --> 18:15.480]  I sent you the link.
[18:15.480 --> 18:21.480]  It was an article by Eric Jackson writing at,
[18:21.480 --> 18:23.280]  I always confuse Forbes and Fortune.
[18:23.280 --> 18:24.440]  I think it was Forbes.
[18:24.440 --> 18:25.400]  It's Forbes, yeah.
[18:25.400 --> 18:27.700]  And as a former Forbes employee, we
[18:27.700 --> 18:31.160]  love it when you confuse Forbes and Fortune.
[18:31.160 --> 18:32.240]  I, you know what?
[18:32.240 --> 18:34.600]  I just did it the other day with there
[18:34.600 --> 18:36.480]  was a story by a Fortune writer.
[18:36.480 --> 18:38.500]  And I, of course, attributed it to Forbes.
[18:38.500 --> 18:41.140]  It really is as simple as, in my mind,
[18:41.140 --> 18:46.440]  they're both business magazines, and they start F-O-R.
[18:46.440 --> 18:47.320]  And that's it.
[18:47.320 --> 18:49.000]  That's how my mind files them away.
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.680]  Just remember that Fortune is the boring one.
[18:51.680 --> 18:56.680]  And it's like the index in my mind, like the hashing index.
[18:56.680 --> 18:58.440]  It only has like three letters.
[18:58.440 --> 19:00.960]  It only goes to F-O-R and the rest.
[19:00.960 --> 19:06.080]  Anyway, now he wrote about this earlier in the year, too.
[19:06.080 --> 19:08.640]  And then I politely rebutted it.
[19:08.640 --> 19:14.040]  But his point is he wants to see Apple use their massive cash
[19:14.040 --> 19:17.560]  reserves to make big acquisitions.
[19:17.560 --> 19:20.080]  And my take earlier in the year was more or less
[19:20.080 --> 19:23.360]  that he was saying, just do something with your money,
[19:23.360 --> 19:25.560]  which seems to me ill-advised.
[19:25.560 --> 19:28.280]  It seems to me like he's articulating in a viewpoint
[19:28.280 --> 19:31.280]  that Apple has to do something with this money.
[19:31.280 --> 19:34.160]  And I just disagree.
[19:34.160 --> 19:37.040]  I think just doing something for the sake of doing something
[19:37.040 --> 19:38.880]  is going to lead to distractions.
[19:38.880 --> 19:39.800]  So he has a follow-up.
[19:39.800 --> 19:40.440]  He just posted it.
[19:40.440 --> 19:41.940]  It was at the very end of the month.
[19:41.940 --> 19:44.800]  It was like over Thanksgiving.
[19:44.800 --> 19:48.180]  And to summarize, I would say he thinks
[19:48.180 --> 19:50.000]  that what they are doing with their money,
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.780]  with the stock buybacks, which is, I think, most,
[19:52.780 --> 19:55.240]  I think it's about 70% of what they're doing, and then
[19:55.240 --> 19:58.520]  the dividends that they're now paying are a waste of money,
[19:58.520 --> 20:03.140]  and that they're not really, that the stock rise that we've
[20:03.140 --> 20:05.480]  seen since Apple's instituted this would have happened
[20:05.480 --> 20:09.840]  anyway, just because Apple's financials are doing better.
[20:09.840 --> 20:14.660]  And they're not going to be able to survive without Steve Jobs.
[20:14.660 --> 20:17.160]  Fear that might have been depressing the stock is gone.
[20:17.160 --> 20:19.080]  Nobody really seems to think that they're
[20:19.080 --> 20:22.560]  in bad hands under Tim Cook's leadership anymore, which I
[20:22.560 --> 20:26.120]  think everybody would agree with that.
[20:26.120 --> 20:27.680]  So what he thinks they should do,
[20:27.680 --> 20:29.760]  even he doesn't think they should have done that.
[20:29.760 --> 20:32.200]  And what he thinks they should do now is he,
[20:32.200 --> 20:33.860]  and I think he's dead serious about this,
[20:33.860 --> 20:37.120]  he thinks they should buy Tesla, which he thinks
[20:37.120 --> 20:40.560]  would cost about $45 billion, Twitter,
[20:40.560 --> 20:42.480]  which would be about $40 billion,
[20:42.480 --> 20:46.680]  buy Pinterest for $15 billion, then
[20:46.680 --> 20:50.080]  spend $10 billion on better batteries through R&D,
[20:50.080 --> 20:56.040]  and spend $10 billion to make iCloud work properly.
[20:56.040 --> 21:00.120]  So what do you think about this?
[21:00.120 --> 21:01.840]  Tell me to laugh.
[21:01.840 --> 21:03.100]  And this also happens.
[21:03.100 --> 21:06.120]  So I also published a story today, Friday,
[21:06.120 --> 21:09.880]  called 10 Things I Learned About Apple This Year on Quartz.
[21:09.880 --> 21:14.040]  And one of the things I touched on
[21:14.040 --> 21:18.680]  was a little commentary about Apple's basically
[21:18.680 --> 21:21.200]  doing their first big buy ever this year, which
[21:21.200 --> 21:25.840]  was Beats Audio and Beats Music, or Beats Electronics,
[21:25.840 --> 21:29.040]  or whatever it's called, which was $3 billion,
[21:29.040 --> 21:34.360]  which is not $40 billion, but it's still pretty big,
[21:34.360 --> 21:38.560]  with the context of people over the years saying Apple
[21:38.560 --> 21:40.720]  should buy all these companies.
[21:40.720 --> 21:44.440]  The one that's been thrown about a lot actually in years past
[21:44.440 --> 21:46.360]  was Adobe, that Apple should buy Adobe
[21:46.360 --> 21:53.280]  so that it owns the professional desktop software market.
[21:53.280 --> 21:56.640]  And one of the articles I found while researching this
[21:56.640 --> 22:00.680]  was during Fireball, 14 May 2008,
[22:00.680 --> 22:02.900]  Why Apple Won't Buy Adobe.
[22:02.900 --> 22:05.440]  And I think the post you wrote here,
[22:05.440 --> 22:10.520]  if you want to do a find and replace with almost
[22:10.520 --> 22:13.920]  every company on that list, you could pretty much
[22:13.920 --> 22:16.240]  paste it in there.
[22:16.240 --> 22:21.800]  And then you've also written about why Apple buying Tesla
[22:21.800 --> 22:24.120]  wouldn't necessarily be the craziest thing,
[22:24.120 --> 22:29.720]  because it fits the model a little bit of what they do.
[22:29.720 --> 22:34.400]  But if you look at Pinterest, and Twitter, and Tesla,
[22:34.400 --> 22:36.400]  first of all, you can't buy three companies that
[22:36.400 --> 22:37.420]  big at the same time.
[22:37.420 --> 22:38.840]  I don't think that's even possible
[22:38.840 --> 22:42.960]  from a logistical or regulatory standpoint.
[22:42.960 --> 22:44.600]  Imagine if you announced $100 billion
[22:44.600 --> 22:47.080]  in acquisitions in a week.
[22:47.080 --> 22:52.680]  My guess is that the government would say, yeah, very funny.
[22:52.680 --> 22:54.680]  OK, now we're going to make you wait for two years
[22:54.680 --> 22:57.400]  while we sift through all this stuff.
[22:57.400 --> 23:02.320]  Yeah, let's just put that aside for now.
[23:02.320 --> 23:03.400]  But I do agree with you.
[23:03.400 --> 23:05.160]  In particular, for example, I think
[23:05.160 --> 23:08.120]  that trying to acquire Twitter and Pinterest simultaneously
[23:08.120 --> 23:13.320]  would definitely be very complicated, getting approval,
[23:13.320 --> 23:16.840]  much more complicated than buying one of them
[23:16.840 --> 23:19.320]  or the other, more than twice as complicated.
[23:19.320 --> 23:22.600]  Because it would be seen as anti-competitive,
[23:22.600 --> 23:26.400]  because in some ways, Pinterest is a social network.
[23:26.400 --> 23:28.240]  And therefore, it competes with Twitter.
[23:28.240 --> 23:34.160]  But beyond that, even if all that stuff was totally doable,
[23:34.160 --> 23:37.360]  then you're Apple, and you have to integrate Pinterest
[23:37.360 --> 23:39.440]  and Twitter into your company.
[23:39.440 --> 23:42.280]  And first of all, how?
[23:42.280 --> 23:43.360]  And second of all, why?
[23:43.360 --> 23:45.480]  What do you do with that?
[23:45.480 --> 23:47.960]  And it just seems to me like that is not
[23:47.960 --> 23:52.560]  what Tim Cook needs to be doing right now.
[23:52.560 --> 23:54.440]  Twitter is not going to change Apple
[23:54.440 --> 23:57.880]  in a way that would make it solve all of its problems.
[23:57.880 --> 24:01.080]  I think there are much, much bigger problems at Apple that
[24:01.080 --> 24:05.080]  have nothing to do with spending cash to acquire new companies
[24:05.080 --> 24:09.160]  that have some relation to potential future businesses
[24:09.160 --> 24:12.440]  for Apple or something like that.
[24:12.440 --> 24:15.680]  Yeah, the why is the bigger question than the how.
[24:15.680 --> 24:18.320]  Because the easiest answer to how
[24:18.320 --> 24:22.120]  would be to acquire them and let them run independently.
[24:22.120 --> 24:23.800]  But then, you know what I mean?
[24:23.800 --> 24:26.360]  How, to me, has some solutions?
[24:26.360 --> 24:28.480]  It's why, though, is the first question.
[24:28.480 --> 24:30.640]  Right, which, by the way, is harder than it sounds.
[24:30.640 --> 24:34.400]  Because the people who made Pinterest into, well, maybe not
[24:34.400 --> 24:36.920]  Twitter, but the people who made Pinterest what it is
[24:36.920 --> 24:38.840]  don't necessarily want to keep making it
[24:38.840 --> 24:41.080]  under the ownership of a bigger company.
[24:41.080 --> 24:43.240]  So this is a very common problem.
[24:43.240 --> 24:46.240]  Anyway, the why is ultimately more interesting.
[24:46.240 --> 24:47.720]  Or the why not, I guess.
[24:47.720 --> 24:50.760]  Because I don't see how owning Twitter,
[24:50.760 --> 24:52.360]  or let's just focus on Twitter.
[24:52.360 --> 24:55.440]  But owning Twitter, to me, doesn't
[24:55.440 --> 24:59.760]  help Apple do anything that Apple already does.
[24:59.760 --> 25:05.360]  It solves nothing in terms of Apple's core businesses, which
[25:05.360 --> 25:10.520]  is really selling computing hardware in now
[25:10.520 --> 25:15.240]  an array of form factors, traditional PCs and laptops,
[25:15.240 --> 25:18.400]  tablets, and, of course, cell phones,
[25:18.400 --> 25:23.240]  and, coming soon, the watch, which are all computers.
[25:23.240 --> 25:26.400]  Fundamentally, that's what Apple does, is they make computers.
[25:26.400 --> 25:30.760]  And the way that they succeed is by making computers
[25:30.760 --> 25:35.240]  that are the best in the world as perceived
[25:35.240 --> 25:37.520]  by a significant number of people
[25:37.520 --> 25:42.520]  who are therefore willing to pay a premium for them.
[25:42.520 --> 25:44.680]  And to me, that's Apple in a nutshell.
[25:44.680 --> 25:46.760]  And there's almost nothing that the company
[25:46.760 --> 25:51.640]  does that matters that isn't in service of that.
[25:51.640 --> 25:53.240]  Which is why it has all this cash
[25:53.240 --> 25:54.720]  to spend in the first place.
[25:54.720 --> 25:56.480]  So for example, yeah, exactly.
[25:56.480 --> 25:57.840]  And that's how they got all this.
[25:57.840 --> 26:01.640]  So for example, the whole thing of iTunes
[26:01.640 --> 26:05.120]  isn't at first, at least at one level of indirection,
[26:05.120 --> 26:07.880]  has nothing to do with selling computers.
[26:07.880 --> 26:11.560]  But I think two levels of indirection, it does.
[26:11.560 --> 26:15.600]  Because one type of computer that's
[26:15.600 --> 26:18.680]  no longer really a significant part of the company's business,
[26:18.680 --> 26:21.880]  but one type of computer is iPods.
[26:21.880 --> 26:24.520]  Computers that are computing devices
[26:24.520 --> 26:28.480]  that are meant as portable music and video players.
[26:28.480 --> 26:32.000]  And to sell those, it really, really helped.
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.120]  I would say it was essential to make
[26:34.120 --> 26:36.800]  it easy to buy content for them.
[26:36.800 --> 26:40.160]  Therefore, that's why iTunes exists.
[26:40.160 --> 26:42.400]  And I think you're selling iTunes a little short.
[26:42.400 --> 26:46.200]  I mean, at its peak of utility in the early 2000s,
[26:46.200 --> 26:49.960]  it was way easier to use than Winamp or something
[26:49.960 --> 26:52.160]  like that for managing a music library
[26:52.160 --> 26:55.720]  and ripping CDs and that sort of stuff.
[26:55.720 --> 26:58.840]  And then, arguably more importantly,
[26:58.840 --> 27:03.080]  it became the home of sync, of syncing
[27:03.080 --> 27:06.680]  your devices to each other, to your iPod,
[27:06.680 --> 27:08.720]  and eventually your iPhone to your Mac,
[27:08.720 --> 27:13.000]  which that's a really great place to be.
[27:13.000 --> 27:14.080]  If you can, what was it?
[27:14.080 --> 27:16.280]  Michael Gartenberg, I think, once tweeted something.
[27:16.280 --> 27:18.440]  If you own sync, you own everything.
[27:18.440 --> 27:20.000]  I don't know, something like that.
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.080]  And that's what iCloud is supposed to do right now.
[27:22.080 --> 27:26.600]  So iTunes actually probably sold a lot of Macs, I would say.
[27:26.600 --> 27:29.200]  Yeah, I don't mean to sell it short.
[27:29.200 --> 27:32.000]  But it's all in service of selling Macs,
[27:32.000 --> 27:36.600]  selling iPods, selling phones, definitely.
[27:36.600 --> 27:38.520]  That they had the infrastructure in place,
[27:38.520 --> 27:43.480]  both the cloud infrastructure of having the store and the cloud
[27:43.480 --> 27:47.120]  servers that could send content over and could do activation.
[27:47.120 --> 27:50.440]  Remember, you used to have to activate your iPhone
[27:50.440 --> 27:51.880]  through iTunes.
[27:51.880 --> 27:53.800]  And the desktop software, which was
[27:53.800 --> 27:56.840]  on hundreds of millions of Macs and Windows PCs,
[27:56.840 --> 27:59.440]  it let them ship the iPhone sooner
[27:59.440 --> 28:01.140]  than they would have been able to otherwise
[28:01.140 --> 28:02.480]  if they didn't have it in place.
[28:02.480 --> 28:04.920]  Because for years, three or four more years
[28:04.920 --> 28:08.580]  before iCloud really became an independent thing,
[28:08.580 --> 28:12.240]  they needed it to have the, just for things like software
[28:12.240 --> 28:15.400]  update, they didn't have the infrastructure in place
[28:15.400 --> 28:18.000]  to do over-the-air software updates to the iPhone.
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.480]  And so if they wanted to do what they definitely
[28:20.480 --> 28:24.440]  wanted to do, which was control the software updates
[28:24.440 --> 28:26.100]  to the phone as opposed to the carrier,
[28:26.100 --> 28:27.240]  they needed iTunes for it.
[28:27.240 --> 28:28.680]  So I'm not trying to sell it short.
[28:28.680 --> 28:30.400]  I'm just saying, no, it was in service
[28:30.400 --> 28:33.540]  of that fundamental business of selling the best computing
[28:33.540 --> 28:34.580]  devices in the world.
[28:34.580 --> 28:35.080]  Yeah.
[28:35.080 --> 28:38.760]  And now, of course, the acquisitionist would say,
[28:38.760 --> 28:41.520]  well, now Apple should buy Spotify,
[28:41.520 --> 28:44.000]  because that's the future iTunes.
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.480]  So why doesn't Apple just spend the cash
[28:46.480 --> 28:48.160]  that it has and buy Spotify?
[28:48.160 --> 28:50.520]  That, I would not disagree with.
[28:50.520 --> 28:52.180]  I don't think they have to buy Spotify.
[28:52.180 --> 28:55.000]  I don't think they have to buy rather than build
[28:55.000 --> 28:57.440]  their own streaming music solution.
[28:57.440 --> 29:02.920]  But if the news came out after you and I get off this show,
[29:02.920 --> 29:04.760]  and the news comes out late on Friday
[29:04.760 --> 29:07.880]  that Apple made an offer to buy Spotify,
[29:07.880 --> 29:09.160]  I wouldn't be surprised at all.
[29:09.160 --> 29:10.800]  Would you?
[29:10.800 --> 29:12.560]  Well, I was just making fun of it.
[29:12.560 --> 29:13.120]  So maybe.
[29:13.120 --> 29:14.240]  Really?
[29:14.240 --> 29:15.160]  I don't, I wouldn't.
[29:15.160 --> 29:18.080]  Now that I think about it, no, well.
[29:18.080 --> 29:19.280]  Well, I might be surprised.
[29:19.280 --> 29:20.680]  I wouldn't be shocked, because it wouldn't
[29:20.680 --> 29:21.480]  seem out of character.
[29:21.480 --> 29:21.720]  Right.
[29:21.720 --> 29:23.420]  In the same way that Beats, Beats
[29:23.420 --> 29:25.000]  was definitely a surprise.
[29:25.000 --> 29:26.640]  Yes.
[29:26.640 --> 29:31.240]  But it doesn't seem totally out of character.
[29:31.240 --> 29:31.720]  Right.
[29:31.720 --> 29:35.960]  And Spotify, it seems to have survived long enough
[29:35.960 --> 29:39.480]  to actually be something important on its own,
[29:39.480 --> 29:44.560]  both in terms of usage and kind of a community and the product
[29:44.560 --> 29:49.360]  that it's built. So yeah, that wouldn't, I don't know if,
[29:49.360 --> 29:51.960]  I guess the question is like, OK, does that,
[29:51.960 --> 29:54.440]  yeah, then there's all these dork questions like,
[29:54.440 --> 29:55.960]  does that become the iTunes app?
[29:55.960 --> 29:58.720]  Or does Spotify, I don't know the answer to that.
[29:58.720 --> 30:03.360]  And I don't know if that even matters.
[30:03.360 --> 30:08.560]  But yeah, I think that something like that, which,
[30:08.560 --> 30:11.800]  the question for all these deals would be like,
[30:11.800 --> 30:14.560]  even if Apple shut all the Android users off
[30:14.560 --> 30:19.080]  of these products in the planet and made them Apple only,
[30:19.080 --> 30:22.280]  does that make the Apple product that much better
[30:22.280 --> 30:26.520]  that people would buy that instead of something else?
[30:26.520 --> 30:30.240]  No, I mean, and the outcry, if they bought Twitter
[30:30.240 --> 30:35.360]  and made it Apple only, the outcry would be phenomenal.
[30:35.360 --> 30:37.480]  I mean, it would lose most of its users.
[30:37.480 --> 30:41.800]  I would guess a majority, some majority of Twitter users
[30:41.800 --> 30:46.680]  are using devices, or at least one device that's not
[30:46.680 --> 30:48.840]  an Apple product.
[30:48.840 --> 30:50.480]  It just wouldn't even, I don't even,
[30:50.480 --> 30:52.560]  why would you buy them if you were just going to?
[30:52.560 --> 30:54.560]  Yeah, or the web, right?
[30:54.560 --> 30:57.400]  Yeah, even just the web.
[30:57.400 --> 30:59.880]  It just, you know, and then what would be the point?
[30:59.880 --> 31:02.160]  It almost seems like, to me, buying Twitter would just
[31:02.160 --> 31:07.280]  be a sign that Apple sees itself now as like a conglomerate,
[31:07.280 --> 31:10.520]  like Berkshire Hathaway, where they just buy companies
[31:10.520 --> 31:13.280]  and they're like a meta company on top of them.
[31:13.280 --> 31:15.520]  Right, and I'm not like an expert
[31:15.520 --> 31:19.560]  in kind of financial tricks and that kind of stuff.
[31:19.560 --> 31:22.800]  But someone explained to me buybacks the other day as,
[31:22.800 --> 31:24.720]  you know, if you have this money and you
[31:24.720 --> 31:28.360]  think that the best investment you can make is in yourself,
[31:28.360 --> 31:31.240]  if you think that Apple shares are going to go up,
[31:31.240 --> 31:34.080]  then that's probably the best investment you can make.
[31:34.080 --> 31:36.440]  And just buy your own shares instead of buying
[31:36.440 --> 31:37.800]  shares in something else.
[31:37.800 --> 31:38.840]  Yeah, I've read that too.
[31:38.840 --> 31:46.800]  That's very close to Warren Buffett,
[31:46.800 --> 31:48.200]  speaking of Berkshire Hathaway.
[31:48.200 --> 31:51.400]  Warren Buffett's advice and take on buybacks
[31:51.400 --> 31:55.520]  is that it's, like most of his stock advice,
[31:55.520 --> 31:58.680]  and again, I'm no expert, but it's as simple as that.
[31:58.680 --> 32:02.080]  That if you think, yeah, exactly what you said.
[32:02.080 --> 32:05.520]  If you think that your stock is underpriced,
[32:05.520 --> 32:08.920]  then it's a good buy.
[32:08.920 --> 32:11.160]  It's a good use of your money, that it actually
[32:11.160 --> 32:13.080]  does help your shareholders and inflate
[32:13.080 --> 32:14.720]  the value of the company.
[32:14.720 --> 32:17.200]  And who better than the leadership
[32:17.200 --> 32:20.440]  of Apple to have a sense as to whether they think
[32:20.440 --> 32:23.240]  that their stock is underpriced.
[32:23.240 --> 32:26.040]  Right, right.
[32:26.040 --> 32:28.000]  I mean, and this is, again, an area
[32:28.000 --> 32:32.280]  where I'm not an expert, but finance reporters that I've
[32:32.280 --> 32:34.280]  talked to have said that Tim Cook has actually
[32:34.280 --> 32:38.280]  done a really good job at converting Apple
[32:38.280 --> 32:41.720]  from being a fast growth, growth, growth, growth
[32:41.720 --> 32:44.240]  company to more of a blue chip, where, yeah, it
[32:44.240 --> 32:47.640]  does have a dividend and buys back its shares
[32:47.640 --> 32:51.280]  and does things with its cash that a growth company probably
[32:51.280 --> 32:56.520]  wouldn't do, but that big institutional investors really
[32:56.520 --> 32:58.840]  respect the way that Tim Cook has done that.
[32:58.840 --> 33:03.640]  Yeah, and as an outside observer who follows Apple,
[33:03.640 --> 33:06.120]  mostly from the product and designs side, not
[33:06.120 --> 33:11.400]  the business side, I completely agree with that.
[33:11.400 --> 33:14.280]  And it does feel like the stock has settled
[33:14.280 --> 33:18.080]  because the market as a whole has accepted that transition,
[33:18.080 --> 33:19.520]  that they're not looking for.
[33:19.520 --> 33:22.760]  I don't see people trying to figure out
[33:22.760 --> 33:27.720]  ways to make Apple Watch an iPhone-sized business
[33:27.720 --> 33:29.640]  in any near-term future.
[33:29.640 --> 33:32.160]  It seems like expectations are reasonable,
[33:32.160 --> 33:37.040]  whereas two years ago, I feel like if they had announced
[33:37.040 --> 33:41.640]  the Watch then, expectations would have been too wild,
[33:41.640 --> 33:44.680]  because business writers, people looking at it
[33:44.680 --> 33:48.320]  from a financial perspective, were asking,
[33:48.320 --> 33:50.560]  how can Apple keep growing at this crazy rate
[33:50.560 --> 33:53.440]  that they've grown the last seven years?
[33:53.440 --> 33:56.960]  Especially having seen the first couple of years of the iPad
[33:56.960 --> 33:59.280]  come out right out of the gate super strong.
[33:59.280 --> 34:01.280]  And look like maybe that was it, right?
[34:01.280 --> 34:03.280]  Right, and look like, oh, wow, this
[34:03.280 --> 34:05.520]  is going to be as big as the iPhone right away.
[34:05.520 --> 34:07.760]  And then, OK, here comes the Watch.
[34:07.760 --> 34:09.800]  Now it's got to be that big too.
[34:09.800 --> 34:12.240]  Yeah, and I'm guilty as charged on that front.
[34:12.240 --> 34:14.560]  I'm on the record as speculating.
[34:14.560 --> 34:17.160]  I didn't pick a year, but I was on the record
[34:17.160 --> 34:19.160]  of saying that I thought an iPad would be a bigger
[34:19.160 --> 34:22.760]  business than iPhone soon, meaning by now.
[34:22.760 --> 34:24.000]  And clearly, that was wrong.
[34:24.000 --> 34:24.680]  It's not.
[34:24.680 --> 34:27.080]  It's settled in far lower.
[34:27.080 --> 34:28.800]  It's actually growth that's stopped.
[34:28.800 --> 34:30.840]  That's not to say growth is stalled forever,
[34:30.840 --> 34:34.400]  but it's for about a year or maybe even longer, right?
[34:34.400 --> 34:35.560]  Can you count the quarters?
[34:35.560 --> 34:37.360]  Four of the last six quarters, it's
[34:37.360 --> 34:39.040]  actually shrunk year over year.
[34:39.040 --> 34:41.440]  So this year, it will almost certainly
[34:41.440 --> 34:43.440]  be smaller than it was last year.
[34:43.440 --> 34:47.480]  Not even just slowing growth, but actually shrinkage.
[34:47.480 --> 34:51.120]  Whereas iPhone, which is older, still continues to grow.
[34:51.120 --> 34:53.040]  They've never had a stronger launch than they
[34:53.040 --> 34:55.080]  did with this year's models.
[34:55.080 --> 34:58.080]  And of course, the iPod has been shrinking for several years.
[34:58.080 --> 35:00.760]  And until very recently, it was still
[35:00.760 --> 35:04.000]  a non-laughable business.
[35:04.000 --> 35:08.680]  So it's perfectly reasonable for things to eventually decline.
[35:08.680 --> 35:10.360]  But I don't think anyone would have
[35:10.360 --> 35:15.680]  expected that the iPad would be in its decline already.
[35:15.680 --> 35:18.880]  And it's probably not permanent.
[35:18.880 --> 35:22.800]  I don't think that tablets were a fad.
[35:22.800 --> 35:24.000]  No, I don't think so either.
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.520]  I think what it was, I've been thinking about this.
[35:26.520 --> 35:28.520]  And I know this is a little bit of an aside
[35:28.520 --> 35:31.400]  on this game of let's spend Apple's money.
[35:31.400 --> 35:33.680]  We're going to spend Apple's money in a minute, so yeah.
[35:33.680 --> 35:36.760]  Yeah, if we didn't have a long digression,
[35:36.760 --> 35:39.400]  it wouldn't really be the episode of the talk show.
[35:39.400 --> 35:44.160]  My gut feeling on the iPad sales stalling
[35:44.160 --> 35:50.400]  is that in the early years, where it was growing,
[35:50.400 --> 35:52.600]  and this is what made me think it was going to be bigger
[35:52.600 --> 35:57.040]  than iPhone, is in the first few years of iPad,
[35:57.040 --> 35:59.560]  iPad's year one was bigger than iPhone's year one.
[35:59.560 --> 36:02.760]  And iPad's year two was bigger than iPhone's year two.
[36:02.760 --> 36:04.480]  It never was bigger than iPhone, but it
[36:04.480 --> 36:09.800]  was bigger than the iPhone in 27, 28, 29,
[36:09.800 --> 36:11.960]  in years one, two, three of iPad.
[36:11.960 --> 36:13.960]  And then it fell behind that curve.
[36:13.960 --> 36:15.960]  And I think it's because the two markets are
[36:15.960 --> 36:16.800]  entirely different.
[36:16.800 --> 36:20.400]  The phone market is literally every person on the planet
[36:20.400 --> 36:23.520]  who can afford a phone.
[36:23.520 --> 36:25.880]  That's where we're headed is that however many billion
[36:25.880 --> 36:30.960]  people there are on the planet, if they are in a country
[36:30.960 --> 36:37.120]  and you have $100 and you can afford some monthly service
[36:37.120 --> 36:40.920]  charge, you're going to have a cell phone if you don't already.
[36:40.920 --> 36:42.240]  So it's an enormous market.
[36:42.240 --> 36:44.600]  It's almost capped by the number of people on the planet.
[36:47.280 --> 36:50.000]  And I think the market for tablets
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.040]  is really a submarket of the PC market.
[36:53.040 --> 36:58.480]  I think what it is is that it's really just part,
[36:58.480 --> 37:01.840]  I think the iPad is best seen as part of the PC market.
[37:01.840 --> 37:03.680]  And what happened in the early years
[37:03.680 --> 37:12.400]  is that the market was vastly underserved by portable PCs
[37:12.400 --> 37:19.080]  that are simpler, more portable, and get way better battery
[37:19.080 --> 37:20.200]  life.
[37:20.200 --> 37:23.480]  The things that made the iPad the iPad,
[37:23.480 --> 37:27.720]  it just sucked all the air out of the growth in laptop sales,
[37:27.720 --> 37:31.440]  including MacBooks for a while.
[37:31.440 --> 37:36.040]  That the iPad style of portable computing
[37:36.040 --> 37:41.840]  is just way better for so many use cases than laptops are.
[37:41.840 --> 37:44.760]  And that it had go-go growth while it
[37:44.760 --> 37:47.240]  fulfilled that unmet need.
[37:47.240 --> 37:49.080]  And then it just reached the point
[37:49.080 --> 37:53.600]  where everybody who really wanted one got one
[37:53.600 --> 37:55.240]  and they still work.
[37:55.240 --> 37:57.240]  And that there's no, then the second factor
[37:57.240 --> 38:00.960]  is that iPads continue, two, three, four-year-old iPads
[38:00.960 --> 38:03.840]  continue to work just great for most people's needs.
[38:03.840 --> 38:05.720]  And so they don't replace them every two years
[38:05.720 --> 38:08.040]  like they do a phone.
[38:08.040 --> 38:14.080]  So that's my digression on iPad decline or growth decline.
[38:14.080 --> 38:16.440]  Yeah, I think that's right.
[38:16.440 --> 38:20.640]  I'm not sure, this is like an example
[38:20.640 --> 38:24.960]  where it's tempting to use your own personal example.
[38:24.960 --> 38:27.600]  But I don't know how, well, you know.
[38:27.600 --> 38:30.440]  So I still use an iPad 1 every day
[38:30.440 --> 38:34.240]  to watch video in my house.
[38:34.240 --> 38:36.400]  But we're about to have to replace it
[38:36.400 --> 38:39.840]  because Time Warner Cable is finally ending support
[38:39.840 --> 38:44.520]  for their app for iOS 5 or whatever it runs.
[38:44.520 --> 38:50.600]  So maybe Apple asked them to do that so that we
[38:50.600 --> 38:52.640]  would buy a new iPad.
[38:52.640 --> 38:54.920]  Yeah, my dad has an iPad 1 still.
[38:54.920 --> 38:57.440]  And I wouldn't say he loves it because he's just not
[38:57.440 --> 38:58.120]  into technology.
[38:58.120 --> 39:00.120]  But he swears he does not want a newer one.
[39:00.120 --> 39:01.080]  It's just fine.
[39:01.080 --> 39:02.200]  It's in perfect shape.
[39:02.200 --> 39:04.160]  But now Candy Crush doesn't run?
[39:04.160 --> 39:05.640]  Uh-oh.
[39:05.640 --> 39:07.480]  Yeah.
[39:07.480 --> 39:09.560]  It's just like it crashes at a certain point.
[39:09.560 --> 39:13.120]  And I'm sure it's, you know, I said I probably,
[39:13.120 --> 39:14.700]  it's just the type of bug that slips in
[39:14.700 --> 39:17.040]  because I bet they don't test on the iPad 1 anymore.
[39:17.040 --> 39:18.640]  And now they're going to get complaints about it
[39:18.640 --> 39:19.880]  and they'll fix it in the next update.
[39:19.880 --> 39:22.120]  But you just have to wait for them to update it.
[39:22.120 --> 39:23.520]  Yeah.
[39:23.520 --> 39:26.600]  But the iPad 1, the iPad 1 is sort of an exception, too,
[39:26.600 --> 39:28.840]  because there's a lot of things that have dropped support
[39:28.840 --> 39:29.560]  for iPad 1.
[39:29.560 --> 39:30.060]  Right.
[39:30.060 --> 39:33.720]  But iPad 2 is effectively still on the market
[39:33.720 --> 39:39.960]  because it's like the guts of that cheap non-retina mini
[39:39.960 --> 39:41.880]  is effectively an iPad 2.
[39:41.880 --> 39:44.080]  Yeah, and half the cash registers
[39:44.080 --> 39:46.840]  at the coffee shops of America.
[39:46.840 --> 39:47.760]  Yeah.
[39:47.760 --> 39:50.040]  If anything, the opposite problem with iPad 2,
[39:50.040 --> 39:53.040]  where developers are going to be saddled with supporting
[39:53.040 --> 39:59.040]  that level of CPU and RAM, it's going to be years.
[39:59.040 --> 40:02.400]  And I think the fact that they're still,
[40:02.400 --> 40:04.220]  and I know a lot of people really complain
[40:04.220 --> 40:05.680]  about the fact that they're still
[40:05.680 --> 40:07.960]  selling that because it's holding back
[40:07.960 --> 40:15.280]  that level of baseline support, where you really only
[40:15.280 --> 40:19.080]  have to support x number of years of iPhones going back.
[40:19.080 --> 40:21.960]  iPad is sort of stretching that a lot further
[40:21.960 --> 40:26.940]  because they're keeping that iPad 2 level of device around.
[40:26.940 --> 40:28.360]  But on the other hand, I think it's
[40:28.360 --> 40:30.440]  a sign that in the real world, millions of people,
[40:30.440 --> 40:31.920]  that's good enough.
[40:31.920 --> 40:32.440]  Totally.
[40:32.440 --> 40:37.920]  And I think maybe it just got a little ahead of itself.
[40:37.920 --> 40:40.160]  Everyone bought a tablet, and then some people
[40:40.160 --> 40:44.000]  bought two or three because they were getting better
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.720]  or coming in at smaller sizes and that kind of stuff.
[40:46.720 --> 40:50.480]  And now, combine that with the probably longer, much longer
[40:50.480 --> 40:55.040]  replacement cycle than a cell phone and a smaller market,
[40:55.040 --> 40:56.800]  now we're seeing the results of that.
[40:56.800 --> 41:02.240]  And maybe in a year or two, as people grow tired
[41:02.240 --> 41:06.200]  or as their current iPads become less useful,
[41:06.200 --> 41:07.800]  they'll replace them.
[41:07.800 --> 41:12.040]  I think a lot of it is on Apple to,
[41:12.040 --> 41:15.160]  and I don't want to repeat a million people who've
[41:15.160 --> 41:19.840]  talked about this, but is really on Apple now to further define
[41:19.840 --> 41:22.160]  what the iPad is for.
[41:22.160 --> 41:26.080]  And I think that they're starting to do that.
[41:26.080 --> 41:30.560]  Yeah, I expect it to grow sort of like the way the Mac has,
[41:30.560 --> 41:34.760]  like slowly but surely, if they can keep it ahead
[41:34.760 --> 41:37.040]  of the market, which is central.
[41:37.040 --> 41:42.280]  I mean, there's a lot of times when I talk,
[41:42.280 --> 41:45.200]  I make the assumption that Apple is going to continue thriving.
[41:45.200 --> 41:48.800]  And sometimes critics of my writing
[41:48.800 --> 41:52.040]  or just readers who are thinking critically
[41:52.040 --> 41:57.680]  will point that out and assume that it's some kind of bias
[41:57.680 --> 42:00.880]  or that I think Apple is magic and that they magically,
[42:00.880 --> 42:02.920]  just no matter what they do, they're going to succeed.
[42:02.920 --> 42:04.680]  It's all based on the fundamental assumption
[42:04.680 --> 42:06.400]  that they can keep doing what they've
[42:06.400 --> 42:09.240]  been doing for close to 20 years, which
[42:09.240 --> 42:11.160]  is making superior products.
[42:11.160 --> 42:14.280]  Whether everybody agrees that they're superior or not,
[42:14.280 --> 42:16.680]  some number of people have seen their devices
[42:16.680 --> 42:19.160]  as superior in significant ways.
[42:19.160 --> 42:20.840]  And assuming they can keep doing that,
[42:20.840 --> 42:22.600]  I think they can keep growing.
[42:22.600 --> 42:24.120]  So there is an assumption there.
[42:24.120 --> 42:26.120]  But I think it's going to grow like the Mac, where
[42:26.120 --> 42:28.040]  the Mac has done great the last few years,
[42:28.040 --> 42:30.680]  and it's growing in an overall shrinking market.
[42:30.680 --> 42:34.200]  But it's very slow growth compared to the iPhone.
[42:34.200 --> 42:34.840]  Yes.
[42:34.840 --> 42:36.800]  All right, so now I'm going to end this parenthesis,
[42:36.800 --> 42:38.400]  and I'm going to say, OK, now you're
[42:38.400 --> 42:40.480]  Tim Cook with $100 billion.
[42:40.480 --> 42:45.160]  How do you spend it to keep making those products great?
[42:45.160 --> 42:47.460]  And it's not buying Twitter and Pinterest.
[42:47.460 --> 42:51.640]  I think it's, you know, and I wrote this in my piece today,
[42:51.640 --> 42:54.640]  like what would be ideal is if they could,
[42:54.640 --> 42:56.640]  if they had a year where they could just
[42:56.640 --> 43:00.640]  focus on making iOS and Mac OS and all their software better.
[43:00.640 --> 43:01.960]  That's not feasible.
[43:01.960 --> 43:05.080]  But if they could increase their engineering organization
[43:05.080 --> 43:08.120]  so that there were enough people to A, build the new stuff they
[43:08.120 --> 43:13.360]  wanted to build, and B, keep refining the old stuff,
[43:13.360 --> 43:15.240]  that that would be a good use of money.
[43:15.240 --> 43:17.100]  Obviously, it's hard to hire engineers,
[43:17.100 --> 43:19.920]  and they're having to open up new offices and other places
[43:19.920 --> 43:21.560]  to do that kind of thing.
[43:21.560 --> 43:25.080]  But that's where I'd like to see Apple spend their money.
[43:25.080 --> 43:28.960]  Right, and then there's the whole mythical man month
[43:28.960 --> 43:32.640]  factor, where you can't, even if you can get more good
[43:32.640 --> 43:36.560]  engineers, you can't solve individual projects problems
[43:36.560 --> 43:38.600]  just by throwing more engineers at them.
[43:38.600 --> 43:39.080]  True.
[43:39.080 --> 43:40.580]  More engineers would definitely help.
[43:40.580 --> 43:44.960]  I don't think there's a single company in technology today
[43:44.960 --> 43:47.880]  that doesn't feel talent starved.
[43:47.880 --> 43:48.640]  I really don't.
[43:48.640 --> 43:51.960]  I mean, I think it's universal.
[43:51.960 --> 43:56.440]  Google, Apple, Microsoft, Twitter,
[43:56.440 --> 43:58.240]  any of those companies, Facebook,
[43:58.240 --> 44:00.400]  any of those companies.
[44:00.400 --> 44:03.800]  For everything I've seen is that the recruiting market
[44:03.800 --> 44:08.880]  is as tenacious or more tenacious than it's ever been.
[44:08.880 --> 44:11.640]  But it's not about throwing more people at the same projects.
[44:11.640 --> 44:14.520]  It's having more people to spread.
[44:14.520 --> 44:16.360]  The size of a team is not going to grow,
[44:16.360 --> 44:18.680]  but it's being able to have more teams.
[44:18.680 --> 44:20.240]  Yeah, right.
[44:20.240 --> 44:22.920]  So maybe Apple should buy one of those coding schools.
[44:22.920 --> 44:23.520]  There you go.
[44:26.600 --> 44:32.180]  No, and I've been using Apple products for 25 years
[44:32.180 --> 44:36.200]  now or more, and nothing was ever perfect.
[44:36.200 --> 44:38.600]  But it does certainly feel now like there
[44:38.600 --> 44:44.240]  are some holes in the products I use every day where nothing
[44:44.240 --> 44:48.360]  is really, really bad, but it could be better to be great.
[44:48.360 --> 44:50.480]  It's stretched a little thin, I think.
[44:50.480 --> 44:54.040]  And maybe that's a good thing.
[44:54.040 --> 44:56.160]  Maybe in the grand scheme of things,
[44:56.160 --> 45:00.880]  if you can't achieve perfection, and let's just assume
[45:00.880 --> 45:03.280]  it's human nature that nobody's perfect,
[45:03.280 --> 45:06.960]  it's a little better to err on the side of going
[45:06.960 --> 45:10.160]  too fast than to err on the side of going too slow.
[45:10.160 --> 45:11.040]  Totally, right?
[45:11.040 --> 45:15.360]  That you want to be on that too fast side and not
[45:15.360 --> 45:16.960]  the too slow side.
[45:16.960 --> 45:20.480]  And I think what we've seen in the last year
[45:20.480 --> 45:23.600]  is that Apple's being a little too fast,
[45:23.600 --> 45:27.000]  they're a little too far away from that optimal line.
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.320]  Things like all the continuity features and stuff like that,
[45:30.320 --> 45:32.680]  most of them work great, but none of them
[45:32.680 --> 45:37.600]  feel quite, to me, perfect.
[45:37.600 --> 45:41.080]  One thing that has definitely changed my daily computing
[45:41.080 --> 45:46.200]  is, because I'm especially between phone and Mac
[45:46.200 --> 45:50.520]  in the house, is I'll go downstairs and get more coffee.
[45:50.520 --> 45:52.760]  And I'll take my phone out, and I'll see something.
[45:52.760 --> 45:54.960]  And now, ooh, I want to link that on during Fireball.
[45:54.960 --> 45:58.480]  And I used to do something like send it to Pinboard,
[45:58.480 --> 46:00.960]  and come up to my Mac, and load Pinboard, and do that.
[46:00.960 --> 46:01.920]  Now I use AirDrop.
[46:01.920 --> 46:04.800]  I AirDrop to myself every day, multiple times.
[46:04.800 --> 46:06.600]  And usually, it's perfect.
[46:06.600 --> 46:09.160]  You just say, share.
[46:09.160 --> 46:12.160]  My other device shows up on AirDrop, and I tap it.
[46:12.160 --> 46:13.800]  And a second or two later, it's there.
[46:13.800 --> 46:17.560]  And then I don't have an extra bookmark in Pinboard
[46:17.560 --> 46:20.240]  that I really didn't want there permanently to do something
[46:20.240 --> 46:21.640]  with.
[46:21.640 --> 46:24.560]  There's no, I don't know what you would call it,
[46:24.560 --> 46:26.680]  digital detritus left over.
[46:26.680 --> 46:27.200]  It's great.
[46:27.200 --> 46:28.800]  But then there's some times where
[46:28.800 --> 46:30.960]  I'm right there next to my Mac with my phone,
[46:30.960 --> 46:33.520]  and I go to AirDrop, and my Mac just doesn't show up.
[46:33.520 --> 46:36.000]  And I haven't turned Bluetooth off or anything like that.
[46:36.000 --> 46:37.360]  Just doesn't show up.
[46:37.360 --> 46:39.440]  And this is my experience as well.
[46:39.440 --> 46:43.160]  And it's most frustrating, because I don't
[46:43.160 --> 46:44.440]  know why it's not working.
[46:46.920 --> 46:50.640]  And then it seems like I'm not in my own contacts file
[46:50.640 --> 46:51.560]  or something like that.
[46:51.560 --> 46:53.360]  So I have to change the AirDrop settings
[46:53.360 --> 46:57.160]  to share with everyone, and not just contacts,
[46:57.160 --> 47:01.880]  but it should know I'm me, because I'm the same.
[47:01.880 --> 47:03.880]  I don't know how it knows I'm me or not.
[47:03.880 --> 47:05.960]  I've seen some people write that it really doesn't work well
[47:05.960 --> 47:06.620]  for them at all.
[47:06.620 --> 47:09.360]  For me, I would say it works at least 95% of the time,
[47:09.360 --> 47:10.320]  maybe more.
[47:10.320 --> 47:13.200]  I'm in the 25% range.
[47:13.200 --> 47:17.080]  And maybe I just need to let loose with the permissions
[47:17.080 --> 47:18.480]  and let it share with everyone.
[47:18.480 --> 47:20.960]  But even just trying to sync with my own Mac
[47:20.960 --> 47:24.960]  or with my wife's iPhone, where we're definitely
[47:24.960 --> 47:27.920]  in each other's contact files, it still never
[47:27.920 --> 47:32.840]  wants to find them when we want to use it.
[47:32.840 --> 47:33.640]  Another example.
[47:33.640 --> 47:35.400]  I mean, it's not a new 2014 thing.
[47:35.400 --> 47:36.440]  It's actually a little bit older.
[47:36.440 --> 47:38.360]  But don't even get me started on my experience
[47:38.360 --> 47:42.920]  with iTunes Match, which is just it.
[47:42.920 --> 47:44.960]  I don't know.
[47:44.960 --> 47:46.600]  My wife had it turned on, too.
[47:46.600 --> 47:51.000]  And it's like, we got our new iPhones a couple months ago.
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.080]  And it's like, she was just pissed.
[47:53.080 --> 47:55.000]  She came back from the gym the one day.
[47:55.000 --> 47:56.880]  And at one point, she had the new phone.
[47:56.880 --> 47:58.160]  And she had all of her music.
[47:58.160 --> 48:00.740]  And it was on the phone, because it was the sort of thing
[48:00.740 --> 48:01.920]  with the new phone that she would have checked
[48:01.920 --> 48:04.720]  before she went to the gym the first time to listen to music.
[48:04.720 --> 48:06.280]  She had it, and she listened to music.
[48:06.280 --> 48:08.080]  And then the next day, she got to the gym,
[48:08.080 --> 48:10.600]  and her phone had no songs, zero, just no songs.
[48:10.600 --> 48:11.680]  They were just gone.
[48:11.680 --> 48:13.800]  That's, yeah.
[48:13.800 --> 48:16.600]  Well, I just did something immensely stupid,
[48:16.600 --> 48:20.080]  which was I put a new hard drive in my iMac
[48:20.080 --> 48:22.960]  and tried to start from scratch.
[48:22.960 --> 48:25.960]  But my iTunes, of course, through iTunes match,
[48:25.960 --> 48:29.840]  already had all the metadata for all my songs in it.
[48:29.840 --> 48:33.040]  So instead of trying to download them all from Apple servers,
[48:33.040 --> 48:38.080]  I dropped the music folder on top of the iTunes icon
[48:38.080 --> 48:43.200]  in the dock to theoretically re-associate all those song
[48:43.200 --> 48:46.520]  files with the app.
[48:46.520 --> 48:50.300]  And then it duplicated everything in the listings.
[48:50.300 --> 48:51.540]  And I'm like, oh, shit.
[48:51.540 --> 48:53.400]  Now I have two copies of every song.
[48:53.400 --> 48:55.440]  I'm going to have to figure out how to go through
[48:55.440 --> 48:57.780]  and unduplicate it.
[48:57.780 --> 48:59.840]  And I tweeted something to that extent.
[48:59.840 --> 49:02.680]  And people are like, oh, don't me, you know, that kind of stuff.
[49:02.680 --> 49:04.180]  And then, you know what's so funny?
[49:04.180 --> 49:08.160]  I came back the next day, and it had totally fixed itself.
[49:08.160 --> 49:09.560]  Nothing was duplicated.
[49:09.560 --> 49:11.240]  So I have no idea how that worked,
[49:11.240 --> 49:13.920]  but it actually worked.
[49:13.920 --> 49:18.480]  Some of these features are supposed to be like AirDrop.
[49:18.480 --> 49:20.340]  I don't even know quite how it works.
[49:20.340 --> 49:22.440]  I know it's some combination of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
[49:22.440 --> 49:26.520]  and those invisible Wi-Fi networks that don't show up
[49:26.520 --> 49:27.440]  as Wi-Fi networks.
[49:27.440 --> 49:30.960]  But it's encapsulating a lot of complexity
[49:30.960 --> 49:32.200]  to make all the handshaking.
[49:32.200 --> 49:35.220]  And then it presents itself in a very simple interface.
[49:35.220 --> 49:36.720]  But it's got to be bulletproof.
[49:36.720 --> 49:39.680]  It's got to be that if this device A and device B
[49:39.680 --> 49:42.480]  are clearly within range of each other and they're both on,
[49:42.480 --> 49:45.840]  it should be every bit as consistent
[49:45.840 --> 49:50.840]  as when you open the Finder and you go to your Home folder,
[49:50.840 --> 49:53.560]  that your Home folder has all of your stuff in it, right?
[49:53.560 --> 49:56.360]  Every time you go to the Finder and you go to your Home folder,
[49:56.360 --> 50:01.000]  you know, the connection between OS X and the files
[50:01.000 --> 50:04.840]  on your hard drive, it's 100% consistent.
[50:04.840 --> 50:07.840]  You know, AirDrop has got to get that good.
[50:07.840 --> 50:09.400]  Right, it should feel like magic.
[50:09.400 --> 50:11.720]  And that's where I'd rather see Apple
[50:11.720 --> 50:16.240]  invest in kind of perfecting that.
[50:16.240 --> 50:17.320]  And I'm sure it's tricky.
[50:17.320 --> 50:20.120]  You know, Bluetooth for years seemed
[50:20.120 --> 50:22.560]  like it was just a joke of a technology.
[50:22.560 --> 50:25.520]  And it seems to have gotten better more recently.
[50:25.520 --> 50:28.760]  And it's definitely, definitely gotten better at battery life.
[50:28.760 --> 50:32.600]  The Bluetooth low energy is aptly named.
[50:32.600 --> 50:35.680]  It's, you know, because I used to never keep Bluetooth on.
[50:35.680 --> 50:37.240]  I always turned it off.
[50:37.240 --> 50:39.320]  The only thing I really could have used it for,
[50:39.320 --> 50:41.380]  well, we have speakers that are Bluetooth.
[50:41.380 --> 50:43.240]  But I didn't use them.
[50:43.240 --> 50:46.400]  And then my car, you can connect it to the car
[50:46.400 --> 50:48.980]  so you can get your calls through the thing.
[50:48.980 --> 50:50.480]  But it was such a hassle to remember
[50:50.480 --> 50:52.400]  to turn Bluetooth off before I got in the car
[50:52.400 --> 50:53.480]  that I never did.
[50:53.480 --> 50:55.880]  And if I left it on, which I always would,
[50:55.880 --> 50:57.320]  if I did remember to turn it on, I
[50:57.320 --> 50:59.720]  would forget to turn it off when I got out of the car.
[50:59.720 --> 51:01.800]  And I'd be like, geez, I didn't even use my phone for a while.
[51:01.800 --> 51:02.760]  Why did the battery life drop?
[51:02.760 --> 51:03.840]  And it's because I had Bluetooth on.
[51:03.840 --> 51:05.400]  But it doesn't, you know, now it just
[51:05.400 --> 51:07.360]  seems like you can leave Bluetooth on your phone
[51:07.360 --> 51:09.360]  and it's, you know, it's good.
[51:09.360 --> 51:11.920]  I would say the biggest thing that Apple could do with the
[51:11.920 --> 51:15.240]  amount of cash that they have is focus it
[51:15.240 --> 51:19.320]  on ways that give them competitive edges that
[51:19.320 --> 51:26.120]  can't be matched by anyone else or by as few other companies
[51:26.120 --> 51:29.040]  as possible.
[51:29.040 --> 51:33.000]  Because I think that's the key to their success for 20 years
[51:33.000 --> 51:36.080]  is that they've had design chops that couldn't be matched.
[51:36.080 --> 51:37.880]  And arguably still aren't.
[51:37.880 --> 51:39.200]  Right.
[51:39.200 --> 51:41.160]  But focus on more and more of those things.
[51:41.160 --> 51:44.720]  I think that the whole Sapphire debacle in Arizona
[51:44.720 --> 51:46.240]  was an attempt at that.
[51:46.240 --> 51:46.760]  Yes, totally.
[51:46.760 --> 51:47.840]  And they botched it.
[51:47.840 --> 51:49.840]  And I think, you know, the idea was
[51:49.840 --> 51:54.760]  that they were going to work out a deal with the, what
[51:54.760 --> 51:56.000]  was that company?
[51:56.000 --> 51:57.400]  I don't remember, but yeah.
[51:57.400 --> 51:59.240]  Well, you know, they worked out a deal
[51:59.240 --> 52:02.840]  where they were going to, you know, supply
[52:02.840 --> 52:07.400]  the capital to create an unheard of number of Sapphire furnaces.
[52:07.400 --> 52:10.520]  And they would have the right to buy as, you know,
[52:10.520 --> 52:13.880]  all of the Sapphire that the facility produced.
[52:13.880 --> 52:16.880]  Which if it had worked, or if they can somehow salvage this
[52:16.880 --> 52:19.200]  and it does eventually work, they'll
[52:19.200 --> 52:21.720]  have something that nobody else will have.
[52:21.720 --> 52:23.440]  Nobody else, you know, Samsung won't
[52:23.440 --> 52:28.160]  be able to make a phone, you know, in quantity
[52:28.160 --> 52:29.680]  with the Sapphire display because there
[52:29.680 --> 52:31.280]  won't be a phone that's going to be
[52:31.280 --> 52:33.320]  with the Sapphire display because there won't be anywhere
[52:33.320 --> 52:34.440]  in the world to buy them.
[52:34.440 --> 52:36.520]  I think it's a perfect example of the sort of thing
[52:36.520 --> 52:38.400]  that Apple should be doing with its money.
[52:38.400 --> 52:38.680]  Yeah.
[52:38.680 --> 52:40.280]  And it's something that Apple can do now
[52:40.280 --> 52:42.440]  that it couldn't do in the old days
[52:42.440 --> 52:46.160]  before they had this giant massive sum of cash.
[52:46.160 --> 52:50.680]  You know, in 2002, 2003, Apple didn't have the ability
[52:50.680 --> 52:53.840]  to spend $10 or $20 billion on x because they
[52:53.840 --> 52:56.560]  didn't have $10 or $20 billion sitting in a bank account.
[52:56.560 --> 52:57.080]  Right.
[52:57.080 --> 52:59.120]  And instead, they famously, like,
[52:59.120 --> 53:04.440]  negotiated just crazy great terms on deals with suppliers
[53:04.440 --> 53:07.040]  and bought out all the flash or whatever.
[53:07.040 --> 53:07.560]  Right.
[53:07.560 --> 53:10.200]  But now they're in a position to bankroll
[53:10.200 --> 53:14.400]  the creation of an entire new, basically, industry.
[53:14.400 --> 53:16.760]  I mean, by the way, the company is called
[53:16.760 --> 53:19.120]  GT Advanced Technologies.
[53:19.120 --> 53:21.240]  And the stat that I found crazy is
[53:21.240 --> 53:27.200]  that Apple already is using one fourth of the entire world
[53:27.200 --> 53:30.400]  supply of Sapphire just for the iPhone camera
[53:30.400 --> 53:32.160]  lens and fingerprint reader.
[53:32.160 --> 53:33.680]  And that was the Wall Street Journal.
[53:33.680 --> 53:35.640]  So, you know, and they've already
[53:35.640 --> 53:38.760]  promised that the top two tiers of Apple Watch
[53:38.760 --> 53:41.160]  are going to have Sapphire covered displays.
[53:41.160 --> 53:41.680]  Right.
[53:41.680 --> 53:44.640]  So that's a crazy amount of the market
[53:44.640 --> 53:48.880]  that they already control for these two tiny components,
[53:48.880 --> 53:50.840]  granted on hundreds of millions of products.
[53:50.840 --> 53:54.320]  But you can imagine now, take those hundreds of millions
[53:54.320 --> 53:57.840]  of iPhones and multiply the Sapphire by whatever,
[53:57.840 --> 54:00.840]  20 or something like that, and you literally
[54:00.840 --> 54:02.760]  are creating an entire new market.
[54:02.760 --> 54:07.440]  And that's what you can do with when you have $100 billion.
[54:07.440 --> 54:10.120]  Secondary digression is on the Sapphire thing.
[54:10.120 --> 54:12.240]  And one of the things I've been thinking about lately
[54:12.240 --> 54:15.000]  is one of the things that's come out of the court filings
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.800]  with the bankruptcy of GT Advanced Technology
[54:17.800 --> 54:20.880]  is that we now know what we suspected all along,
[54:20.880 --> 54:23.560]  but we know for sure now that at some point,
[54:23.560 --> 54:27.880]  Apple had hoped to use Sapphire in this year's new iPhones
[54:27.880 --> 54:31.760]  for the displays, not just for the camera back.
[54:31.760 --> 54:33.720]  That if everything had gone perfectly,
[54:33.720 --> 54:36.600]  or at least according to plan or some measure like that,
[54:36.600 --> 54:38.680]  Apple, you know, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus
[54:38.680 --> 54:41.800]  would have Sapphire displays.
[54:41.800 --> 54:43.240]  And they don't.
[54:43.240 --> 54:48.600]  Which makes me wonder how much, whether they're now,
[54:48.600 --> 54:50.840]  the fact that GT Advanced failed,
[54:50.840 --> 54:55.360]  whether they're in trouble now with the Sapphire displays
[54:55.360 --> 54:58.560]  for the watches.
[54:58.560 --> 55:00.680]  And not that they would have to change it,
[55:00.680 --> 55:02.880]  because they've already promised that they're coming out.
[55:02.880 --> 55:06.560]  I would be shocked if they switched to glass
[55:06.560 --> 55:09.120]  for the addition in the stainless.
[55:09.120 --> 55:12.240]  But I'm wondering if we might not
[55:12.240 --> 55:17.120]  see one of those Apple launches where midnight, everybody's
[55:17.120 --> 55:21.640]  madly clicking, and by like 12, 15 Eastern,
[55:21.640 --> 55:23.760]  or I guess they go on sale Pacific, I don't know.
[55:23.760 --> 55:27.560]  But 15 minutes after the pre-orders go online,
[55:27.560 --> 55:31.040]  people are already seeing quotes of four to six weeks.
[55:31.040 --> 55:35.760]  And the next day, you're already seeing six, seven weeks
[55:35.760 --> 55:37.680]  estimated delivery.
[55:37.680 --> 55:40.280]  Not necessarily because it's so many people buying them,
[55:40.280 --> 55:42.480]  but because it's the Sapphire.
[55:42.480 --> 55:46.240]  If they were banking on GT Advanced Technology,
[55:46.240 --> 55:49.200]  the Sapphire might be a significant constraint.
[55:49.200 --> 55:50.560]  Just a hypothetical.
[55:50.560 --> 55:53.840]  Yeah, in supply and maybe even in price.
[55:53.840 --> 55:57.040]  So although at this point, they'd
[55:57.040 --> 56:01.480]  probably eat the money and make the watches, I have no idea.
[56:01.480 --> 56:03.760]  Yeah, but I'm not Tim Cook, so I don't know.
[56:03.760 --> 56:04.280]  Exactly.
[56:04.280 --> 56:06.120]  I think that this is the sort of thing
[56:06.120 --> 56:09.640]  though that Tim Cook is the best in the world at, at least so
[56:09.640 --> 56:10.240]  far.
[56:10.240 --> 56:11.640]  But the other thing that I thought
[56:11.640 --> 56:13.240]  that I'm probably wrong about that,
[56:13.240 --> 56:16.360]  that the Sapphire will be a significant gating issue
[56:16.360 --> 56:18.160]  on production, is that they're going
[56:18.160 --> 56:20.840]  to need a lot less Sapphire for Apple Watch
[56:20.840 --> 56:22.960]  than they would have for the phones.
[56:22.960 --> 56:24.680]  Because the phones are, you know,
[56:24.680 --> 56:26.640]  how many did they sell in the holiday quarter?
[56:26.640 --> 56:29.160]  How many are they expected to sell this holiday quarter?
[56:29.160 --> 56:31.120]  I don't know, but I'm going to make up a number
[56:31.120 --> 56:31.960]  and say 50 million.
[56:31.960 --> 56:35.800]  Yeah, and figure maybe 30 to 40 million of those
[56:35.800 --> 56:36.960]  are iPhone 6s.
[56:36.960 --> 56:37.480]  Right.
[56:37.480 --> 56:38.040]  Something.
[56:38.040 --> 56:38.240]  Yeah.
[56:38.240 --> 56:38.760]  Could be.
[56:38.760 --> 56:41.440]  Let's just say at least 30 million iPhone 6s,
[56:41.440 --> 56:44.320]  which are bigger, and in the case of the 6 Plus,
[56:44.320 --> 56:46.720]  a lot bigger than the Watch.
[56:46.720 --> 56:48.520]  Whereas the Watch, you know, nobody
[56:48.520 --> 56:50.680]  knows how many they're going to sell, but especially
[56:50.680 --> 56:53.240]  in the more expensive stainless and addition levels.
[56:53.240 --> 56:53.760]  Right.
[56:53.760 --> 56:55.400]  It's not 30 million in a quarter.
[56:55.400 --> 56:59.280]  And it's not a five inch display.
[56:59.280 --> 57:02.240]  And we're not going to be told how many they've sold.
[57:02.240 --> 57:03.960]  No.
[57:03.960 --> 57:04.800]  Which is true.
[57:04.800 --> 57:06.320]  Yeah.
[57:06.320 --> 57:08.280]  So yeah, that's a great example.
[57:08.280 --> 57:10.400]  Another one which they did do is Test Flight.
[57:10.400 --> 57:13.120]  I mean, I think that's the sort of thing
[57:13.120 --> 57:16.840]  that they actually probably know they should have done sooner.
[57:16.840 --> 57:20.800]  And probably we're just being snobby about it.
[57:20.800 --> 57:22.760]  Why are all these developers using Test Flight
[57:22.760 --> 57:25.920]  when they should be using our built-in drag and drop email
[57:25.920 --> 57:28.640]  attachment app testing system?
[57:28.640 --> 57:33.040]  So you know, any time you see a bunch of app developers
[57:33.040 --> 57:37.080]  jumping onto a third party tool like that, just pick it up.
[57:37.080 --> 57:40.240]  I mean, you know.
[57:40.240 --> 57:42.280]  They've certainly tried to build a few of them.
[57:42.280 --> 57:45.040]  Like Cloud Kit, which I haven't used,
[57:45.040 --> 57:50.440]  is very similar to Parse, which I do use, which Facebook owns.
[57:50.440 --> 57:53.280]  You know, that's the kind of thing that they should just
[57:53.280 --> 57:55.520]  keep an eye on for that kind of stuff.
[57:55.520 --> 57:57.360]  And none of those are billion dollar deals.
[57:57.360 --> 57:59.200]  Those are all much smaller.
[57:59.200 --> 58:01.880]  I think manufacturing in general is a big deal.
[58:01.880 --> 58:06.240]  And I can't help but wonder if this is another purely
[58:06.240 --> 58:06.960]  hypothetical.
[58:06.960 --> 58:12.400]  But we know that they're building the Mac Pros in the US
[58:12.400 --> 58:15.080]  or assembling them.
[58:15.080 --> 58:18.240]  And if they have grand plans to shift
[58:18.240 --> 58:22.200]  more and more of their assembly to the United States, which
[58:22.200 --> 58:27.600]  if they do, my guess would be that it would be more
[58:27.600 --> 58:31.440]  along the lines of robotatizing the assembly line.
[58:31.440 --> 58:33.680]  Because if you ever look like this,
[58:33.680 --> 58:35.280]  it was surprising to me when we first
[58:35.280 --> 58:38.040]  started getting behind the scene looks at Foxconn
[58:38.040 --> 58:40.280]  and how phones are assembled and iPads are assembled
[58:40.280 --> 58:42.440]  and how much of it is just done by hand
[58:42.440 --> 58:48.640]  by just people at a bench putting these pieces together.
[58:48.640 --> 58:51.240]  I think if they brought that to the United States
[58:51.240 --> 58:53.760]  to make it cost effective, it would probably not
[58:53.760 --> 58:56.280]  be like a bonanza of manufacturing jobs.
[58:56.280 --> 58:58.600]  It would probably be about figuring out a way
[58:58.600 --> 59:00.880]  to robotatize the assembly.
[59:00.880 --> 59:03.800]  And then they could bring it internally.
[59:03.800 --> 59:06.800]  And they'd have these roboticized assembly lines
[59:06.800 --> 59:08.840]  that no one else in the world would have.
[59:08.840 --> 59:12.240]  Like Foxconn gains the ability to do x.
[59:12.240 --> 59:16.320]  Then anybody who uses Foxconn gets the ability to do x.
[59:16.320 --> 59:18.160]  And Foxconn itself, too.
[59:18.160 --> 59:18.760]  Exactly.
[59:18.760 --> 59:20.560]  I'm a little surprised they have not
[59:20.560 --> 59:22.120]  been more competitive already.
[59:22.120 --> 59:26.840]  Right, and for example, just look at the Nokia tablet
[59:26.840 --> 59:30.520]  that looks like an iPad Mini look-alike.
[59:30.520 --> 59:34.440]  And it's drilled aluminum, all this stuff.
[59:34.440 --> 59:36.920]  It's really like a relabeled Foxconn product.
[59:36.920 --> 59:40.000]  It's a Foxconn tablet that Nokia is putting their name on.
[59:40.000 --> 59:41.440]  Where do you think Foxconn learned
[59:41.440 --> 59:43.200]  to make a tablet that looks like that?
[59:43.200 --> 59:44.560]  Well, they learned it from Apple.
[59:47.600 --> 59:49.840]  I don't think it's any coincidence that Samsung, which
[59:49.840 --> 59:53.680]  makes a lot of components and until recently made
[59:53.680 --> 59:57.360]  all the CPUs for the iPhone and iPad,
[59:57.360 --> 01:00:01.200]  got better at making cell phones after they
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:03.800]  worked with Apple on that.
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.360]  So I wouldn't be surprised to see that.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.720]  That, to me, would be an interesting way
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.720]  for Apple to spend money.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:11.360]  And I think the GT Advance deal was a sign of that.
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:14.000]  It's not just about materials, but maybe assembly in general.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.880]  But maybe for some reason, why did they
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.160]  do the whole thing with GT Advance instead of Apple
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:23.480]  just making and owning their own Sapphire furnace?
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:24.040]  I don't know.
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.760]  For some reason, they seem resistant to,
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.760]  they want to decrease the risk.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:29.720]  And then if they fail.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:32.920]  And if you looked at the court filings on the terms,
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:35.800]  boy, did they ever decrease the risk.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:40.840]  It's crazy how, basically, Apple has complete control
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.000]  over everything.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.160]  And GT basically can't do anything.
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.720]  And GT's court filing was kind of pathetic
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:54.320]  because they made us this offer that was horribly unbalanced.
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.520]  And everybody's like, wow, Apple's really mean.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.640]  There was even a phrase where they quoted a guy that,
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:00.520]  in a phone call, a guy from Apple
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:04.320]  told them to put your big boy pants on.
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:07.120]  It was a very dismissive.
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:09.840]  But my take on that is it wasn't like GT Advance
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.080]  had to say yes to this.
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.840]  They agreed to all of it.
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:15.360]  It's sort of like unsaid in their filings
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.920]  is, well, of course we said yes because if it worked out,
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.480]  look at how much money we would have made.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:21.440]  Totally.
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:25.480]  Meanwhile, there's a $50 million NDA penalty.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.120]  Yeah.
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.080]  That was an interesting thing that came out of it.
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:28.600]  Yeah.
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.520]  And it got worse for subsequent ones.
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:32.720]  That's great.
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.320]  One thing I've noticed, and if you
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:37.640]  look at the list of suppliers and stuff
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.800]  that we know about Apple Watch, it's
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:46.320]  a different list than that makes iPhone and iPad.
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.840]  Just like the component makers, it's
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.640]  coming from a lot of different companies.
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.020]  And I can't help but think that's
[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:53.560]  because Apple is dissatisfied with their manufacturing
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.240]  partners for those things because of all the rampant
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.800]  leaks.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:58.760]  Could be, yeah.
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.960]  Yeah, in a way that competing products
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.120]  seem to be piggybacking on their innovations.
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.880]  So I think that one thing they could do with their resources
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:14.760]  now is try to make those things something that they own.
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:19.320]  I think an interesting example of that already, I would say,
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:25.560]  are the A series systems on a chip, which
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:29.680]  it's like they've turned the whole,
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.700]  we use different CPUs than the standard components
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:34.480]  that everybody else does thing on its head.
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:38.240]  In the old days, when Apple was on Motorola 68,000 chips
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:44.340]  and later PowerPC chips, and the Wintel industry was on x86,
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:46.640]  Apple was selling in lesser quantities.
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.400]  And they could never, the quantities
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.760]  were never enough to keep up.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.720]  There's no way for Motorola, and IBM,
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:56.400]  and the partners that were making PowerPC chips to really
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:01.840]  sustain the advances that were necessary to keep up
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:04.060]  with Intel because the numbers just weren't there.
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:07.480]  And Apple couldn't have had no resources to do it on their own.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:12.000]  Whereas now, by making these wildly popular, massively
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.640]  selling devices that are using these chips,
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:17.800]  they're getting the economy of scale advantages
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:23.360]  with their A5 series, A6, A7, A8.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.040]  And by all accounts, at a non-tech in those places,
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.520]  faster and far more power efficient
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:31.760]  chips than the Snapdragon's that everybody else is using.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:34.440]  And they're not sharing.
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:37.240]  Nobody else gets to make a phone with these amazing systems
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:38.920]  on a chip.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:41.280]  How can they do more things like that?
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.920]  Yeah, and so there's a hardware element to that.
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:48.080]  And then there's a software element and, I think,
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.080]  a lot of people, and a services element, too.
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:54.440]  I mean, what can, you know, I keep coming back to iCloud.
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:56.440]  And I'm trying to think, like, bigger picture,
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:59.120]  is iCloud a success so far?
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:02.320]  And there's a lot of griping about little things
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:03.000]  here and there.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.840]  I think it is sort of a success.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.580]  I mean, you know, it backs up my phone every night.
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:09.800]  And I don't even think about it.
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:12.640]  And it seems like they're trying to do more with it.
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:15.560]  But that's the kind of thing where
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:20.360]  that could easily be a huge advantage over everyone else.
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:25.360]  Like, you know, just back people's stuff up.
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:27.920]  You know, make sharing super easy.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.840]  That's going to be hard to be.
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:30.560]  It should be.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:31.280]  It should get better.
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:31.860]  And they should keep.
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:32.520]  I think it is.
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.320]  I think it's quietly getting a lot better.
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.040]  I think that they're nibbling at the problems around the edges.
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.960]  But it's never going to be a sustaining advantage.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.120]  It's a lock-in advantage, where once you're there
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.040]  and your backups are already there,
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.900]  it's a lot easier to just buy an iPhone
[01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:48.240]  and have your backup restored to the new iPhone
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.000]  than it is to switch to Android.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.040]  But it's not really that big of a competitive advantage
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:56.560]  because Google stuff is so good at those things.
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.000]  You know, that you're, you know.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.040]  Google, like, yeah, Gmail and Google Calendar and Google
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.160]  Hangouts are really good.
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:05.520]  But I don't know if Google Drive is really catching on
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.520]  or anything like that.
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:09.000]  So I don't know.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.440]  Anyway.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.920]  I think that Apple has a better chance.
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:16.360]  I think that cloud stuff in general, the best
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:18.800]  that they can hope for is to be as good as the state
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:19.480]  of the art.
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:19.720]  Right.
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.000]  And I think a lot of the, actually,
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.680]  a lot of people saying that they should buy all these companies
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:26.640]  are saying, oh, they'll learn how to be better at the cloud
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:30.760]  if they own Twitter or Pinterest or something like that.
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.040]  And I mean, there was probably a point
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.160]  where I used to think that.
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.680]  I don't think that would help right now.
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:36.600]  No, I don't think so either.
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:37.100]  No.
[01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:37.600]  No.
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.120]  I don't think that the problem is fundamental,
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.360]  just generic cloud.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.120]  I think the problem is just specific problems.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:44.640]  Yeah.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.560]  And Pinterest, him saying that they should buy Pinterest.
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:47.980]  I mean, Pinterest is a good company
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:49.520]  and they're doing interesting things.
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:54.200]  But it doesn't make any, again, the same thing with Twitter.
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.880]  I just don't see how that gives Apple
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:59.400]  any advantage in what they do.
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:03.240]  If they think that Pinterest is a good investment today,
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:06.560]  it would make far more sense for like, what's that company,
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:10.240]  Braeburn Capital, the secretive Nevada company that
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:15.440]  controls Apple's investments.
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:19.120]  Some of the stuff they do do with the cash,
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:22.640]  it would make sense for Braeburn to just buy stock in Pinterest
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:25.840]  and just think they'll make money on it,
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:31.160]  but rather than have Apple buy them and control them.
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:34.360]  Yeah, well, next time you talk to MG,
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:38.640]  ask him if he were running Apple Ventures instead of working
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:42.680]  at Google Ventures, what he'd be doing with that $100 bill.
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:44.600]  Yeah.
[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.760]  Let me take a break here and thank
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:50.200]  our second sponsor of the show, our very good friends
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.300]  at Squarespace.
[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:53.680]  You guys know what Squarespace is.
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:58.640]  It's the all-in-one place to build and host your website.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.960]  What kind of website?
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:00.640]  Any website.
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:03.160]  You can use Squarespace to just have a blog.
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:06.160]  You can use Squarespace to create a store
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.660]  with built-in commerce that you don't have to pay extra for.
[01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:13.800]  It's just part of being a Squarespace customer.
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:16.200]  Beautiful design.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.560]  All sorts of templates to choose from.
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:21.900]  All new Squarespace 7 platform where the way
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:24.040]  that you manage the design, the way
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.140]  that you change which of the components
[01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:31.160]  you have on each page, it's all drag and drop right there
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:32.560]  on the site itself.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:33.680]  Couldn't be easier.
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:37.560]  It's the way, like when people said the problem with the web
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:40.480]  originally as conceived back in the 90s
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:43.240]  was that it wasn't editable in itself.
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:44.480]  That's like what Squarespace is.
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:48.120]  Squarespace is like the editable web where you're just there.
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:51.400]  And if it's your site, you just edit anything
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.700]  you want right there in place.
[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:56.320]  Super, super easy.
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:00.320]  No technical knowledge whatsoever is necessary.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.020]  But if you do have technical knowledge,
[01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:03.820]  and I know a lot of people who listen to this show do,
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:05.160]  you can get into the code.
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.280]  And you can put your own JavaScript in pages.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:11.760]  You can change the HTML and the templates and stuff like that.
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:15.960]  24 hour, seven day a week support via live chat
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.480]  and email.
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:19.640]  They've got support people all around the world.
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.600]  That's how they do the 24 hours a day thing.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:27.880]  They've got them in Europe, New York, I think Portland, Oregon.
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:31.160]  And it starts at just $8 a month.
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:32.400]  $8 a month.
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:37.720]  Incredibly, I don't know how they can offer this for $8
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:38.880]  a month.
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.560]  When you pay for the year, if you
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:43.840]  pay for a whole year in advance, you get a free domain name.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:46.420]  All their templates feature responsive design.
[01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:52.000]  Everything scales to look great on iPhone 5, iPhone 6 Plus,
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.240]  iPad, Android tablets, anything.
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:55.960]  You name it, the designs look great.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.400]  Scaled to the right size.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:00.240]  So if you have any reason to start a website,
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:02.280]  you're thinking you need a website for blank.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:04.120]  Doesn't matter what blank is.
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:06.840]  Check out Squarespace and see for yourself.
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:11.440]  When you sign up, you can get a free trial.
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:13.920]  No credit card necessary.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:17.720]  Go to squarespace.com slash the talk show.
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.880]  And then when you do pay, when your free trial's up
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:23.160]  and you're like, man, this is just as awesome as Gruber
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.080]  said it was.
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:24.920]  I'm going to buy it.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:27.000]  Just make sure you use this code JG.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.480]  That's my initials.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:32.480]  And you'll get 10% off and show your support for the talk show.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:34.440]  So my thanks to Squarespace.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:36.320]  All right, what else you want to talk about today?
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:40.680]  Oh, well, something I want to talk to you about for a while,
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.440]  and that's the idea of institutional taste.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:45.520]  And I think this might be a Gruber term.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.480]  I'm not sure.
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:48.880]  But I've been thinking about it.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:53.340]  And as I've been kind of taking a look at companies this year
[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:56.260]  and writing about them at Quartz,
[01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:59.840]  and I'm curious about a bunch of things.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:05.400]  But I guess first, how do you define institutional taste?
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:08.960]  I would say it's almost like a cultural value,
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:12.580]  like a shared cultural value, that you
[01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:18.040]  see things the same way and you value things the same way.
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.140]  One of the points, like a recurring theme
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:23.000]  in my work in recent years is the idea
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.160]  that it's not just what your priorities are,
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.000]  your top three priorities, but it
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  matters what order those top three priorities are in.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.120]  It matters which one.
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:44.040]  You can say that you value good material, the materials you
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:48.640]  use, the shape and the weight.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:50.920]  Or like with Apple, they value thinness.
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:52.880]  They value weight.
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:54.400]  They value battery life.
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:55.800]  They value elegance.
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:58.760]  They value how it feels.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:01.760]  But it's clear that Apple, institutionally,
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:07.600]  values thinness and weight more than they value battery life.
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:16.280]  Because otherwise, here's my old iPhone 4 right here
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:19.760]  by my desk, which is, I think when it came out,
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:21.920]  was billed as being the world's thinnest phone.
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:25.840]  And if it wasn't, it was pretty darn close.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:27.720]  And that's just a couple of years ago.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:30.760]  So if they valued battery more than thinness,
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:34.280]  I think that today's iPhone 6s would be maybe not as thick
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:36.700]  as the iPhone 4, but they'd be thicker than they are.
[01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:38.280]  And they would have used that thickness
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:41.160]  to put more battery in there.
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:44.720]  It just matters which order those priorities are.
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.520]  Not that they don't care about battery life,
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:49.880]  but they obviously value thinness and weight above that.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:51.600]  I think institutional taste, that's
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.120]  just a sign of it, and it propagates
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:58.200]  that it's people who share those values and that taste that
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:00.160]  are drawn to work at the company.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:03.560]  And the company recruits people who share those values.
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:09.120]  And then it sustains itself, I think.
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:09.800]  It tends to.
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:16.200]  And obviously, this is something that Apple excels at.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:17.800]  Whether we can really define it or not,
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:23.920]  really kind of explain everything that it applies to.
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:26.760]  This is kind of a pro-Apple argument to be made.
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.200]  Are there other companies you see
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:30.960]  that you think have good institutional taste?
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:34.680]  I know we can name a bunch that have bad, historically
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.920]  have had bad taste.
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:40.000]  Are there others that you think have good taste?
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.280]  I think Google clearly does.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:47.520]  And I think that's why they have as rabid of fans
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:51.040]  as Apple does, but that they tend to be different people.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:54.400]  Most people who truly say they love Google
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.280]  either are ambivalent about Apple
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:58.040]  or they have mixed feelings about Apple.
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.640]  Probably mixed feelings is more common,
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.240]  where they probably do use a MacBook.
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:02.920]  A lot of them use MacBooks, but that they
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:06.720]  feel more affinity for Google.
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:11.360]  But Google's good taste is in things like simplicity
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:13.000]  and minimalism.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  I mean, I think the fact that if you just go to Google.com
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.520]  and what you see on that page here in 2014
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:29.360]  is so close to what you saw back in 2002
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:32.480]  or whenever, when Google was a beta at Stanford, where
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:35.280]  it's just a box and two buttons.
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:38.960]  And I mean, look at how much minimal crap
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.280]  they've added there.
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:43.640]  And for all that we complain about Google and the advertising
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:45.800]  that they do, that they've still resisted the urge
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:49.600]  to really put advertising on that home page,
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.240]  that they still only show it on results.
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:55.600]  Imagine what they could charge for just one ad, something
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:58.680]  like the deck, just one thing up in the corner on that page.
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:00.320]  Imagine what they could charge.
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:01.440]  And they don't.
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:05.720]  And I think it's a sign of Google's taste.
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:08.040]  Do you think so, and I'll just throw this out there,
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:11.680]  I think that historically a company with bad taste
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:15.760]  has been Microsoft, which shows in everything
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:21.200]  from their kind of visual design to the awkwardness
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:25.080]  of their stage presentations to product decisions
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:26.160]  and all that kind of stuff.
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:32.440]  But I've actually been surprisingly, I guess,
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:35.960]  surprised at how I'm starting to see this.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.720]  Even little things like their file formats, like old versions,
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:40.640]  like when you read how when somebody's backward
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:45.560]  engineered an old version of the word.doc file.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:48.680]  It's so, it's just horrible.
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:51.440]  Nobody would design a file format like that
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:52.480]  if they had taste.
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.080]  Yeah, and I don't know if it was satire,
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:58.000]  but like the Microsoft Bob logo is pretty much
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.160]  like emblematic of Microsoft.
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.000]  It seems like it's getting a little better.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.280]  I don't know, maybe they're making some smart decisions
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:08.800]  now.
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:11.920]  Can this taste be taught or changed,
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:16.920]  or is it in any sort of time frame that would matter,
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:18.720]  or is it the kind of thing that's
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:23.400]  kind of too deeply ingrained in a company to change?
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:25.400]  I think you have to go through some sort
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:28.160]  of stressful transition to change,
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:31.840]  and I think that's what we're seeing with Microsoft.
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:35.960]  And it's even bubbled up to the point where, not that,
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:38.120]  I don't think he got forced out, but it's
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:39.960]  pretty close, it's about as close
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:44.920]  as you can get to forcing out a CEO of a wildly
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:48.480]  profitable major corporation.
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:52.520]  And without any sort of impropriety or anything
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:54.560]  like that, nobody accused Ballmer
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:58.320]  of any kind of fiscal impropriety or crimes
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:00.800]  or anything of the sort.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:03.400]  It was really, honestly, I think it really,
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:05.760]  eventually his lack of taste caught up with him,
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:08.920]  and the market had moved on.
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:10.880]  So I think Microsoft is going through that sort
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:13.320]  of transition, and we definitely see it, I think.
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:17.760]  I mean, the new version of Windows,
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:20.960]  the stuff you see on the surface,
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:28.320]  it's absolutely, positively not a copy of iOS, and it's good.
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:30.520]  I don't think I would prefer it, I really don't.
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:32.680]  It's been a long time, it's been a couple of years
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:34.640]  since I tried living with Windows Phone,
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:37.160]  but I don't think it's to my liking.
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:43.600]  But wherever it ranks in the world of OS design right now,
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.880]  it certainly shows a taste that Microsoft never
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:47.400]  had in the old days.
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:49.480]  Yeah, and at the same time, we've
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:53.360]  gone from a company that used to say, oh, why would anyone
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:57.800]  buy their kids an iPod to, hey, we've got Office for iPad,
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:01.520]  and why would anyone buy their kids an iPod, or whatever.
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:06.080]  Now there's Office for iPad, and they're integrating Dropbox
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:08.640]  into PowerPoint, and this kind of stuff.
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:12.320]  And it seems really, I don't know,
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:15.760]  maybe it's too short a time frame,
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:21.560]  but I'm a little excited about what I see there.
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.760]  I would go so far as to tie it together
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:26.520]  with the first half of the show, and say that it's actually
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:29.520]  not even so much about taste, but that Microsoft
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:32.440]  is institutionally backing away from the view
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.320]  that they can do it all themselves,
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.320]  and that they should do it all themselves.
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:41.400]  Like the Microsoft at its peak of industry dominance
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:43.920]  did everything other than the hardware,
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:48.720]  and they really kind of defined PC hardware in a way
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:52.720]  that without making any PCs themselves,
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:55.040]  they had enormous influence on it.
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.400]  But they literally did everything.
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:00.000]  They wrote their own operating system.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.720]  They wrote all of the major apps for that operating system.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.960]  They had their own developer tools.
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:09.440]  They had their own eventually, like with C Sharp,
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:14.360]  their own developer, and Visual Basic, their own languages.
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:16.480]  They went their own way in a route that was just
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:21.600]  unprecedented, and that nobody else has ever really tried
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:22.120]  to do again.
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:25.280]  And this is where I tie it with the first half of the show,
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:28.680]  is to me, the warning sign for Apple,
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:32.280]  like the biggest canary in the coal mine as we, you know,
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:34.360]  how is Apple ever, you know, going to, you know,
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:37.040]  what am I looking for to see if Apple is maybe starting
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:40.880]  to lose their edge, are signs of hubris, right?
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.680]  I think that's the word that Microsoft had.
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:46.360]  And that's, today's Microsoft doesn't have that anymore.
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:50.640]  Like all those things you just listed,
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:53.800]  you know, where they're advertising the iOS apps,
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:56.600]  they're integrating with Dropbox.
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:59.120]  I just saw a thing the other day this week where now
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:02.440]  that you can do, they have a thing where they're running
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.360]  on Google's cloud service.
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:05.200]  Oh, yeah.
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:09.400]  Right? You can run Exchange and, you know,
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:12.280]  run Windows servers in Google's cloud.
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:16.600]  All of those things are signs that they now, they're off
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:20.560]  of that, you know, Microsoft only all the way
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:22.720]  down the stack.
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:25.920]  Totally. And I guess we should also disclose they've also,
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:28.640]  you know, sponsored your podcast and your app.
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:29.560]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:30.960]  Which, you know.
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:31.920]  Totally. Exactly.
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:32.760]  That's a good point.
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:33.680]  No, absolutely.
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:37.200]  Yeah. And I'll tell you the fact that Azure
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:40.160]  and all the window, you know, all their cloud-based services
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:44.360]  are absolutely positively not designed as cloud services
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.720]  for Microsoft client devices.
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:52.680]  They are designed as cloud, what's the word, agnostic.
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:53.000]  Yeah.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.160]  You know, they're just good cloud services.
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:01.000]  Yeah. So I'm very interested to see what some
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:04.280]  of the most, you know, balmery Microsoft stuff,
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:05.240]  what happens to that?
[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:08.720]  Like those stores that were kind of crappy ripoffs
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:12.800]  of Apple stores, you know, what happens to those now?
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.120]  That kind of stuff.
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:15.280]  But we'll see.
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:18.600]  You know, it's only been less than a year, so.
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:19.480]  I'll tell you a company
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:23.280]  who I think has bad institutional taste is Amazon.
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:24.160]  Oh, yeah.
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:24.600]  Oh, yeah.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:24.960]  Totally.
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:25.600]  Really, really bad taste.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:29.720]  And I think that's exactly what inspired me to ask you
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:35.400]  about this was thinking about that phone, man.
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:36.480]  That Amazon phone.
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:37.200]  Oh, yeah.
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:38.800]  Did you ever use one?
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:39.920]  No, I haven't yet.
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:40.720]  Yeah, I haven't either.
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:43.640]  But boy, the reviews were bad.
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:45.920]  And now that it's been on the market for a while,
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:48.880]  and I've seen a little bit more like random,
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:51.400]  a few random people who just picked one up on a lark,
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:54.160]  it's even worse.
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.800]  Like the things I've seen from people who aren't
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:00.920]  like gadget reviewers from The Verge or whatever site,
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:03.240]  people who just review a lot of phones.
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:05.920]  Where the Fire Phone was, in my opinion,
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:08.000]  very poorly reviewed in general.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.840]  But the just real people who don't do it,
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:11.000]  who just bought it to see what it's
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  like really just scorched it.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.480]  It's bad in every way.
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:19.720]  And it's funny because I like Amazon as a service.
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:21.760]  I probably spend more money on Amazon
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:25.680]  than any other place besides whoever
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:27.000]  owns my apartment building.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.320]  But they've never had a good looking website.
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:35.720]  All their hardware stuff just screams out,
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:37.800]  either we're just doing this to do it,
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:40.400]  or we don't really care that much about how good it
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.720]  is to use.
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:46.440]  The scathing reviews of the Kindle, the newest Kindle
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:48.680]  saying, look, this is supposed to be
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:51.040]  the top end e-reader in the world.
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.240]  Why don't you treat it like that?
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:56.560]  They've never had good page turning on a Kindle, ever.
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:01.080]  It's the most astounding thing in all of consumer electronics.
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:04.240]  And it's not astounding that the first one or the second one
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:08.080]  or maybe even the third one didn't have great page turning.
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:11.200]  But it's astounding to me that it really has never gotten
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.720]  just iteratively better year after year.
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:18.920]  And at this point, after seven or eight years on the market,
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:21.680]  that they don't have page turning down is crazy.
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:25.320]  Or even justifying the text, forcing
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:29.480]  it to be the full width of the screen
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:31.720]  and not letting you left justify it.
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:34.360]  I wrote about this a few weeks ago.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.480]  It's a solved computational problem.
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:38.520]  It's not easy, but it's solved.
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:41.880]  And there are even open source solutions to it, TEC,
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:46.840]  the T, lowercase e, capital X, typesetting system
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:53.480]  that Donald Knuth created back in the 70s.
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:58.120]  I linked to an academic paper that one of his students
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:00.760]  wrote in 1980.
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:06.640]  And it's a solved problem to do proper justification
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:10.520]  without unseemly gaps between words
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:13.520]  and with intelligent use of hyphenation.
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:17.080]  It's a solved problem, and yet they don't do it in the Kindle.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:19.040]  It's crazy.
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:21.240]  Yeah, a lot of good fonts.
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:23.600]  The font selection is atrocious.
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:30.360]  And it's not like having good fonts and good layout
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:33.080]  isn't a core part of what the device is.
[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:35.280]  It's the whole point of the device.
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:36.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:39.400]  It would be like if the iPods didn't really
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:40.960]  have good music playback.
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:42.000]  Right, yeah.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  Although maybe some argue that they didn't.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.280]  But still, if you're trying to make the best reading
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:50.920]  device in the world, which I guess they're not,
[01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:53.160]  they would certainly act more like it.
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:55.440]  Or maybe they're doing the best they can,
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:58.000]  which is where the institutional taste comes in,
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.360]  is just that they don't.
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:06.680]  The difference is that most people view a book as a string.
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:09.080]  Meaning, you know what I mean, like in programming terms,
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:12.200]  that it's a string of text.
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:14.640]  And that if you review somebody's novel,
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:17.600]  it doesn't really matter what.
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:21.600]  I've never seen, and it just indicates
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.240]  what I'm obsessed with, but I've never
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:25.720]  seen a book review that includes a review of the layout
[01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:26.600]  of the book.
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:31.200]  Whereas if I reviewed a book, I'd be tempted to do that.
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:34.720]  Like to me, clearly it's not the main reason you read a novel.
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:36.480]  And I guess in general, I would rather
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:39.560]  read an interesting, well-written novel that's
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:43.120]  poorly typeset than read a terrible novel that
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.520]  is beautifully typeset.
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:46.480]  Of course, that's the difference.
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:48.600]  And even me, as somebody obsessed with typography,
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:49.600]  would agree with that.
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.320]  Whereas with music, nobody ever says,
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:53.560]  I don't care if the music sounds bad,
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.040]  like at a technical level.
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:57.320]  It's fundamental to listening to music.
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:01.000]  But as the person making the device,
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.840]  that should be the obsession.
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:07.000]  The people making Kindles at the top level of the design team
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.200]  should be people who are obsessed with good typography.
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:12.240]  It's criminal that they're not.
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:16.560]  But I think it's a sign of Amazon's institutional taste,
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:18.320]  their priorities.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:20.040]  Yeah, I think that nails it.
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:22.720]  I'm going to take a moment here and thank our good friends
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:24.000]  at Harry's.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.760]  Now, if you're a regular listener of the show,
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:26.920]  you know what Harry's makes.
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:29.760]  They make high-quality men's shaving products.
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:31.760]  They come in amazing packages.
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:33.000]  They make their own blades.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.960]  They built their own razor blade factory,
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:37.120]  or they bought a razor blade factory in Germany.
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:38.240]  They make their own blades.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:40.880]  They've got great, high-quality handles.
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:46.640]  Shaving creams, foam, foaming gels, aftershave,
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:47.320]  you name it.
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:50.040]  If it is a shaving product, they make it.
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:53.920]  And it's great quality at amazing prices.
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:58.080]  Compared to the mass market stuff you buy in drugstores.
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:58.920]  Really great stuff.
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.680]  Well, look, it's the holidays.
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:05.800]  And if you're listening to this show on or before December 17,
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:09.080]  they have a fantastic holiday offer for you.
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:12.120]  Use this code, talk show holiday.
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:14.480]  All one word, talk show holiday.
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:16.280]  That's not the regular code.
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:18.640]  That's the one just for this holiday offer.
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:22.880]  What that code gets you is it gets you $5 off their Winter
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:24.560]  Winston set.
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:28.520]  The Winter Winston set comes with a chrome handle,
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:31.480]  three of their high-quality blades,
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:35.800]  and either their shaving gel or the foam.
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:36.680]  Your choice.
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:39.080]  It's already wrapped.
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:41.120]  And you know how cool their packaging is.
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:43.800]  It is a fantastic gift.
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:48.080]  You might never think to give shaving products as a gift,
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:50.720]  regular Gillette or crap like that.
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:53.560]  Harry's, though, I think this would make a fantastic gift.
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:56.320]  So go to harrys.com.
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:59.400]  Use this code, talk show holiday.
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:02.600]  And order the Winter Winston set.
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:06.200]  Save $5 for anybody on your shopping list.
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:08.720]  Great deal, great product, great offer.
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:11.440]  My thanks to Harry's.
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:12.880]  All right, last bit.
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:13.560]  So last bit.
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:16.840]  So let's talk about Instagram, which just announced
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:24.240]  300 million active users, which is almost entirely likely more
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:26.360]  than Twitter has at this point.
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:30.360]  Twitter has not yet released their December quarter numbers.
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:31.960]  And it's a little different because they
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:33.440]  do the quarterly average.
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:34.880]  Yeah, and if you look at the graph,
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.960]  though, it's pretty clear that Instagram is
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:38.280]  Growing faster.
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:40.640]  And it's pretty amazing.
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:44.680]  I think it's certainly the number two or number three
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:48.160]  app that I check after I wake up.
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:53.160]  And it's kind of cool that even after Facebook bought them,
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:56.360]  although that kind of maybe gives them an edge, too.
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:58.160]  Although Facebook hasn't really integrated
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:01.720]  as much as it could have, that it's still growing so quickly.
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:04.360]  It still feels like very much of its own thing.
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:05.560]  I think it totally does.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:08.000]  I would say as somebody who doesn't use Facebook
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.200]  and therefore was, and for very specific reasons,
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:11.560]  that it just doesn't appeal to me.
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:14.760]  When they bought Instagram, and I was a big fan of Instagram,
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:15.840]  I was very worried.
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:18.800]  And they said, oh, but we're not going to mess with it.
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:20.240]  We're not going to Facebook guys it.
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:23.480]  We're going to let Kevin Systrom and his team, you know.
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:25.560]  We bought them because we love what they're doing.
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.760]  And we're going to have them keep doing what they're doing.
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:29.440]  And it's like, I've heard that before.
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:33.240]  You hear that every time there's a popular thing gets acquired.
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:35.720]  You hear it's not going to get, we're not going to mess it up.
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:39.480]  And most of the time, it gets messed up eventually.
[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:44.160]  And I would say from the outside, as an Instagram user,
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:45.520]  it's completely true.
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:47.360]  If I didn't follow tech news, I would
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:52.440]  have no idea that Instagram was bought by Facebook.
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:55.600]  So I made a kind of a jerky tweet the other day.
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:59.120]  But one of the things that surprised me the most is,
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:01.160]  and you could say like, oh, are they just
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:03.480]  kind of napping over there?
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:06.760]  They've changed it so little that it almost could
[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:08.880]  seem like it's negligence.
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:11.000]  Not that I think that they should throw a bunch of features
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.240]  at it, but there's a lot of little things
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:18.320]  that I think are still missing from Instagram that would
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:20.080]  really actually make it better.
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:23.240]  For example, something as simple as being
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:26.240]  able to have multiple users in the app so that, you know,
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:28.760]  I know a woman who runs four Instagram
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:31.160]  accounts for three restaurants and her personal one.
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:32.920]  And every time you want to switch accounts,
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:35.920]  you literally have to sign out and then sign in
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:38.040]  with your username and password.
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:41.880]  Conceptually, Instagram is very similar to Twitter.
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:43.520]  And comparing Twitter to Facebook
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:47.880]  is difficult because it's just different purposes, very
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:49.080]  different design.
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:52.560]  But fundamentally, Instagram is Twitter for pictures.
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:57.160]  And combined with that, instead of having replies,
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:59.160]  you have comments on the picture.
[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:00.760]  And so it's slightly different ordered.
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:03.640]  The pictures are still Twitter order, newest at the top,
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:05.440]  oldest at the bottom.
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:07.000]  The only real conceptual difference
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.120]  in the main timeline is that comments
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:11.560]  go under the picture they're commenting on as opposed
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:15.120]  to Twitter where the replies are all in a chronological stream
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:16.640]  as well.
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:17.840]  Very, very similar.
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:19.960]  And so therefore, I completely agree with you,
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:21.880]  it makes every bit of sense that you
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:23.840]  could have multiple accounts in Instagram
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:26.440]  that it does in Twitter.
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:29.200]  Right, and it's something like that where another one is
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.080]  like hyperlinks.
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:35.560]  Like you can't even link a comment, which you can't put
[01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:40.080]  a link in a comment or anywhere really, which on one hand,
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:41.600]  cuts down spam.
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:43.640]  You don't have as much people spamming links.
[01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:47.840]  On the other hand, you see people like both humans
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:50.920]  and companies saying, here's something
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:54.040]  we did to access it, go to our bio
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:55.360]  and click the link in our bio.
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:58.040]  Yeah, that's a very.
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:30:59.520]  And it's a hack, it's a clever hack.
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:01.880]  But it's still, it's like, these are
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:04.920]  places where a competitor could eventually catch hold.
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:06.280]  Another one is shopping.
[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:08.280]  And now they're in the US, there's
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:09.600]  a company called Spring.
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:11.160]  And in Japan, there's a company called
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:14.240]  Origami that are basically Instagram
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:16.960]  with a Buy button attached to it.
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:19.120]  And even just a hyperlink from Instagram
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:23.320]  would do so much to make services like that unnecessary.
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:26.560]  And I wonder if it's Instagram just keeping things
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:28.320]  really simple because that's what works
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:30.760]  and it's really hard to argue with that.
[01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:32.600]  They've done so well.
[01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:37.080]  Or if a few little features like that
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:38.720]  could really have gone a long way.
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:42.480]  Yeah, and if the hyperlinks work the way
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:44.280]  they do in almost all Twitter clients
[01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:47.200]  where instead of bouncing you out to a third party browser,
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.320]  it opens a web view right there in the app,
[01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:51.200]  you're not even losing the engagement
[01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:54.480]  because when they close the web view,
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:55.600]  they're probably gonna be right back
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.100]  where they were in Instagram.
[01:31:57.100 --> 01:32:01.440]  So I don't think it's about engagement trapment, right?
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:04.600]  I can only guess that it's a spam thing.
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:07.560]  But even then, I feel like that's making us,
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:09.600]  the users suffer for a problem
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:12.400]  that they're supposed to solve.
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:14.240]  Yeah, I mean, imagine if Twitter said,
[01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:16.440]  oh, we're getting rid of all links because of spam.
[01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:20.080]  I mean, it's just, no, you can't do that, sorry.
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:23.000]  Yeah, I would think that the way that they would do it
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.520]  would be to follow Twitter's lead
[01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:26.120]  and do their own Tico thing.
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:28.720]  Because that's fundamental to Twitter's anti,
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:30.480]  I know that they do other things too
[01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:32.640]  in that they track all sorts of analytics
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.160]  through all the links that go through Twitter
[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:37.620]  now that they're all redirected through T.co.
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:41.200]  But part of it too is that it lets them centralize spam.
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:43.080]  And malware and that kind of stuff.
[01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:45.160]  Right, any kind of bad, anything,
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:48.520]  I say spam meaning anything that is like,
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:51.920]  oh, we should delete that and identify the user as a,
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:53.920]  Yeah.
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:55.480]  Are they turning out the lights on you?
[01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:56.920]  No, I haven't been kicked out.
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:58.480]  It's funny, there's supposed to be another meeting
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:32:59.300]  in here right now.
[01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:01.460]  And I emailed the person asking if I can use the room.
[01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:04.720]  So they might show up angrily any minute now, but.
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:06.980]  So we could sign off on a moment to notice.
[01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:08.300]  But I heard a loud click.
[01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:12.800]  No, that was me missing the garbage can with my seltzer.
[01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:13.880]  Sorry about that.
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:17.880]  So another feature is the equivalent of the reblog,
[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:19.800]  the regram.
[01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:23.880]  And I could totally see why they don't have that feature
[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:27.780]  because then it's all your photos and it's more authentic
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:29.440]  and it's not a bunch of junk.
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:31.540]  But on the other hand, people are hacking that.
[01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:34.800]  And there are apps that will let you do this regram,
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:38.080]  even a video with an overlay and that kind of stuff.
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:40.040]  Have you seen those?
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:40.880]  No, I haven't.
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:42.560]  Okay, well, I see them, you know.
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:43.400]  I know what you mean though.
[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:46.080]  It's probably not even like 5% of the pictures in my feed.
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:48.980]  And I'm sure if there were regramming,
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:50.960]  there would be more than that.
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:53.660]  But it's still interesting that that's the kind of thing
[01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:58.560]  where pretty much every other stream-based social network
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:00.560]  has added that feature,
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:03.640]  whether it's Tumblr's reblog or on Vine,
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:06.400]  you can re-vine, on Twitter, you can retweet.
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:10.180]  On Instagram, you basically have to re-upload a photo.
[01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:12.760]  I would almost say it's the defining feature of Tumblr.
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:14.800]  Yeah, probably.
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:15.760]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:18.080]  And it's hard, you have to, and from a phone,
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:18.920]  you're kind of stuck
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:22.200]  because you can't just save an Instagram to your local thing
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:24.040]  and pick it out and put it back in.
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:25.960]  You've got to do goofy stuff.
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:26.800]  I guess when I do see it,
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:28.520]  it's usually just like a screenshot.
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:29.360]  It's a screenshot.
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:30.600]  And there are apps that do this.
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:33.060]  It's like Regram app or something like that.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.760]  And these are all, I'm sure, decisions that they've made
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:40.440]  and they seem to have just decided no for all of them.
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:43.220]  And again, it's really hard to argue with them.
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:46.820]  Whatever they're doing is working so well
[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:50.760]  that you almost can't argue that they could be doing better.
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:54.080]  And they've made little changes like the Explore screen
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:57.440]  is so much more interesting now that they are basing it
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:00.620]  on your friends and people you follow.
[01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:01.720]  So that's great.
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:06.400]  The image tools that they built, not just the filters,
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:09.400]  but the different image tools are really, really,
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:10.960]  really good.
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:15.960]  I also think that they have excellent notification controls
[01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:19.560]  because I easily, and without any confusion,
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:22.340]  set up Instagram so that I'm only notified
[01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:27.340]  when people who I follow do something of interest.
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:28.880]  Like I don't want notifications
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:32.920]  when any Joe on the internet favorites one of my Instagrams.
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:35.520]  I only want ones, you know, I get very few-
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:37.000]  Can you believe people leave that on?
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.920]  Like I'll pick up someone's phone sometimes
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:41.040]  and they'll have 40.
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:42.600]  I will not name names
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:47.320]  because I find it to be such a curiously needy feature.
[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:50.700]  But I have definitely seen people who have that turned on.
[01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:55.420]  Well, I look at see who likes my photos.
[01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:57.840]  I think that's one of the most interesting parts of that-
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:59.480]  Oh yeah, but I don't want notifications for it.
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:02.400]  No, no, it's not like I don't care.
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:04.980]  And I don't like look back at yesterday's thing
[01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:06.520]  and then open up the list and see it,
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:08.160]  but I don't want notifications for it.
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:09.000]  Totally.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.240]  And then another one is like, they don't have an iPad app.
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:12.080]  Yeah, that's a huge one.
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:14.760]  And it drives me crazy because it's actually,
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:16.120]  you know, at first people were like,
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:18.240]  well, why would you use Instagram on an iPad?
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:19.840]  Who's taking photos on an iPad?
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:22.720]  Well, the answer is a lot of people take photos on an iPad.
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:26.200]  And I look at a ton of Instagram on the iPad
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:28.600]  and it's actually gotten better.
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:31.280]  It's actually, well, it's really great on the iPhone 6 Plus
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:33.520]  and it's gotten a little better over the years
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:38.520]  as the 2X multiplication set up on the iPad
[01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:41.480]  has gotten a little better, but it's still,
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:43.340]  it's like, come on, is it really,
[01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:44.860]  is it that hard to make an iPad app?
[01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:45.800]  Maybe it is, I don't know.
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:50.200]  No, not in broad strokes, not,
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:52.080]  now once you can, it might be depending
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:54.000]  on how your app was architected,
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.120]  but if you're able to support the new iPhone 6 sizes,
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:02.120]  then you're doing stuff that makes it really easy
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:03.280]  to do iPad 2.
[01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:08.280]  In fact, it's so easy that with this whole size class thing
[01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:12.200]  and you know, it was a huge, huge point of emphasis
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:15.280]  at WWDC this year, it's a huge part of iOS 8.
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:17.920]  All of it clearly was, you know, about setting things up
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:19.680]  so that apps were ready for the iPhone 6
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:21.220]  with the two new sizes.
[01:37:22.780 --> 01:37:27.500]  But it's so, creating an iPad app now is really almost,
[01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:32.500]  almost like just creating another bigger iPhone size.
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:34.960]  If you can do the 6 and 6S, you can do the iPad.
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:36.840]  And I say that even though Vesper,
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:38.560]  which does support the 6 and 6S,
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:40.720]  still doesn't have an iPad version,
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:42.760]  but if we really wanted to drop everything else
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:43.720]  we were doing and do that,
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:45.560]  it actually wouldn't be that much work.
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:48.280]  And Marco even talked about that with Overcast
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:53.280]  where he got an, he called it an accidental version
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:56.000]  of an iPad version of Overcast.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:56.840]  Oh yeah, I remember, yeah.
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:59.620]  Because there was a bug where if you used a storyboard
[01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:01.240]  for your startup screen,
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:04.340]  didn't matter if you also specified in your XML that,
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:07.700]  hey, me, this app, I'm iPhone only.
[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:11.500]  So if I'm running on an iPad, run me in the iPhone mode.
[01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:15.660]  The OS had a bug where if you had that storyboard
[01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:17.360]  as your startup image, it would say,
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:20.660]  oh, you're a modern app, so I'll run you as an iPad app.
[01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:23.180]  And it actually, without him ever even intending it
[01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:25.580]  or trying it, it actually was usable.
[01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:29.820]  So yes, at this point it seems like
[01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:31.900]  there's no technical reason why Instagram
[01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:33.580]  should not have an iPad app.
[01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:35.460]  And then one more is the icon.
[01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:39.300]  I mean, every, literally every app on my iPhone home screen
[01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:44.300]  has done something a little more iOS 7 inspired.
[01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:48.700]  I can almost see it, I'm not an icon artist,
[01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:53.700]  but I can almost see what the flat Instagram icon
[01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:54.900]  would look like.
[01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:57.480]  Keep the colors, keep the basic gimmick
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:02.220]  that it looks like a Polaroid and just flatten it.
[01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:03.340]  Right.
[01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:06.820]  So is this, you know, and they're not not doing these things
[01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:08.940]  to spite people, so I just wonder.
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:11.180]  And I guess I should probably be a good journalist
[01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:13.860]  and ask them, and maybe I will,
[01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:16.820]  but it's still, as a frequent user,
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:19.580]  it has puzzled me over the years.
[01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:21.300]  And especially recently, as you see,
[01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:25.060]  that it is arguably the second or third
[01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:29.700]  most important social network in the world that,
[01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:32.100]  and I totally am on the side of simplicity
[01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:35.180]  and saying no and all that stuff, but.
[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:38.100]  Yeah, well, I think that your bucket list right there,
[01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:41.580]  your checklist of what Instagram should do
[01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:44.380]  is excellent because it does,
[01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:45.960]  to me it doesn't add any complexity.
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:47.740]  Like supporting the iPad doesn't make
[01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:50.380]  using Instagram more complex, it just makes it better.
[01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:51.220]  You know?
[01:39:51.220 --> 01:39:53.220]  And in addition, I'll just throw out this point,
[01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:55.400]  in addition to the fact that you're right,
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:57.920]  that a lot of people, and Apple even admits it now,
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:00.460]  that a lot of people use their iPad as a camera
[01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:03.540]  for producing Instagram content.
[01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:06.100]  But clearly, photography is something
[01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:08.700]  that always looks better bigger, always.
[01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:11.660]  So it would be better if you had both, you know,
[01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:12.980]  side by side, it would always be better
[01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:16.500]  to look at Instagram on the iPad.
[01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:19.300]  I think when they eventually do, I think they will, right?
[01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:20.460]  They're gonna come out with an iPad app.
[01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:22.820]  I think when they do, people are gonna be like,
[01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:24.400]  wow, this is amazing, I can't believe
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:25.820]  that they didn't do this before.
[01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:27.460]  Totally.
[01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:30.260]  All right, so if you're Kevin Systrom, get on it, man.
[01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:31.100]  Yeah.
[01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:32.280]  And you know what, and I understand,
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:34.380]  like that, you know, as part of Facebook,
[01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:37.960]  they've had to build out an advertising business.
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:40.600]  And I find their ads to be totally fine,
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:42.340]  like they're not, you know, I look at them
[01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:44.700]  and I see, oh, that's kind of cheesy, so that's an ad,
[01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:47.620]  but I'm not mad that it's there.
[01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:49.260]  And I know that they have to build a business,
[01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:51.100]  so I'm happy that they're doing that.
[01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:53.060]  And maybe that's, you know, maybe they're waiting
[01:40:53.060 --> 01:40:54.780]  on adding hyperlinks until they have
[01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:56.420]  a commerce business of some sort.
[01:40:56.420 --> 01:41:01.420]  But it just, you know, it makes me maybe
[01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:05.540]  like them a little less, I guess.
[01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:07.260]  Yeah, I wonder if that's what they're holding out for,
[01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:09.960]  that you're only gonna get, you only get links
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:11.460]  if you pay for it.
[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:12.940]  I don't know, but that doesn't make, yeah,
[01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:15.820]  just, I don't know if that helps anyone either, so.
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:18.940]  Cool, all right, well, I love Instagram,
[01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:22.380]  and I'm not, you know, I'm not trying to be a jerk, but.
[01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:24.180]  I think one way that you can measure,
[01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:26.500]  and I know that this monthly active viewers thing
[01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:28.300]  is like the industry standard numerically,
[01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:30.420]  but I feel like the way that you can,
[01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:33.860]  the better way to measure social networks
[01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:35.900]  is when you're out in the real world,
[01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:38.260]  and you look at like the menu at the restaurant you're at,
[01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:41.460]  or the window of the place where you're gonna buy,
[01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:44.260]  you know, baked goods or something like that.
[01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:47.220]  Which icons do they have there, right?
[01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:50.500]  And for a long time, it was just Facebook and Twitter,
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:51.960]  a lot of places I saw.
[01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:54.380]  Or YouTube, or, yeah.
[01:41:54.380 --> 01:41:56.380]  Yeah, yeah, depending on, you know, yeah,
[01:41:56.380 --> 01:41:58.420]  sometimes YouTube, but usually, but a big one,
[01:41:58.420 --> 01:42:01.160]  it was Facebook and Twitter, the pairing.
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:05.500]  And man, I see Instagram everywhere now.
[01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:07.740]  I don't know, I should, I'll actually,
[01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:09.220]  I'm gonna make an effort now
[01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:11.500]  that if I see Facebook and Twitter,
[01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:14.020]  but don't see Instagram, I'll take a picture of it
[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:15.860]  and start collecting it, and I'll bet I don't,
[01:42:15.860 --> 01:42:17.800]  I bet I don't get many of them.
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:19.900]  I see Instagram everywhere.
[01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:22.500]  It's clearly on par with Twitter in terms of that.
[01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:25.620]  And I would even add,
[01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:27.960]  going back to Eric Jackson's thing,
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:31.380]  I do see the Pinterest logo a lot more places now.
[01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:34.180]  Not as much as those, as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram,
[01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:35.500]  but it's growing.
[01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:36.900]  Yep, yeah, I think so.
[01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:39.760]  Especially anything with like a visual component to it.
[01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:45.860]  Shopping, food, you know, that sort of stuff.
[01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:50.420]  I actually think, you know, not to get too deep on this,
[01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:54.020]  but I actually think that companies make better Instagrammers
[01:42:54.020 --> 01:42:56.460]  than they make Twitter users.
[01:42:56.460 --> 01:43:00.220]  I think that, you know, I follow a lot of restaurants
[01:43:00.220 --> 01:43:02.880]  and stores that I've been to on vacations
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:04.660]  and that kind of thing on Instagram.
[01:43:04.660 --> 01:43:08.260]  You know, even places that I may never go back to,
[01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:09.980]  just to kind of remember them,
[01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:11.500]  that I would never follow on Twitter.
[01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:13.040]  Because on Twitter, they're talking, you know,
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:15.940]  here are our daily specials or something like that,
[01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:19.460]  or here's a link to a story that we were mentioned in.
[01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:22.660]  Whereas on Instagram, they're showing photos of their shop
[01:43:22.660 --> 01:43:24.420]  or of their neighborhood or of their products
[01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:26.100]  or of their customers and that kind of stuff.
[01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:27.980]  And I actually find it really interesting.
[01:43:27.980 --> 01:43:29.880]  I follow the official Yankees account
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:31.400]  on Instagram and Twitter.
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:35.060]  And on Twitter, a lot of the time when they tweet,
[01:43:35.060 --> 01:43:38.340]  my finger starts hovering towards the unfollow button.
[01:43:40.020 --> 01:43:42.620]  And on Instagram, it's almost always great.
[01:43:42.620 --> 01:43:45.020]  It's like some kind of picture of, you know,
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:48.060]  either something going on in the current Yankee season
[01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:51.420]  and from a staff member with incredible access, right?
[01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:54.140]  Like, you know, on the field at batting practice,
[01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:58.020]  like a great angle of something,
[01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:01.220]  or it's like a piece of history, like a history.
[01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:02.740]  And it always makes me smile.
[01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:05.540]  It's like exactly why I wanted to follow them on Instagram.
[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:08.360]  Whereas on Twitter, it's just a bunch of hashtags and shit.
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:09.200]  Yeah.
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:11.860]  Where, you know, and this is like, maybe to close out,
[01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:13.900]  you know, Evan Williams yesterday was quoted,
[01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:16.660]  I think in Fortune saying,
[01:44:16.660 --> 01:44:21.060]  I don't give a shit if Twitter has more users than Instagram,
[01:44:21.060 --> 01:44:21.960]  which is well put.
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:26.860]  And by the way, aside, Evan Williams is working way harder
[01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:28.940]  than Evan Williams needs to be working.
[01:44:28.940 --> 01:44:30.980]  He's really done a great job with Medium.
[01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:33.940]  And I'm really impressed by that.
[01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:35.860]  Anyway, but I think he's right.
[01:44:35.860 --> 01:44:38.700]  I think that Twitter and Instagram, like comparing them
[01:44:38.700 --> 01:44:41.860]  because you have the same metric, monthly active users,
[01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:46.060]  sure, that's fair, but they really are different products.
[01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:46.900]  Yeah.
[01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:48.700]  You know, and there's obviously bad blood
[01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:51.840]  because Twitter probably could have
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:55.220]  and should have bought Instagram and, you know.
[01:44:55.220 --> 01:44:56.060]  Yeah.
[01:44:56.060 --> 01:44:57.780]  And Facebook should, you know, that kind of thing.
[01:44:57.780 --> 01:44:58.620]  But.
[01:44:58.620 --> 01:45:00.900]  Yeah, and I think in their buyer's remorse
[01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:03.780]  over not having bought them is why they bought Vine
[01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:06.460]  and Vine is, you know, I don't think it's a failure,
[01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:07.500]  but it's not at that level yet.
[01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:08.340]  I don't see Vine.
[01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:09.160]  Yeah, it still exists,
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:10.900]  and it's doing some interesting stuff,
[01:45:10.900 --> 01:45:12.300]  but it's not Instagram.
[01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:15.420]  Nobody's putting Vine logos on their restaurant windows.
[01:45:15.420 --> 01:45:17.300]  No, I mean, it's not even a joke,
[01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:20.340]  but it's a really good sign of real world, you know,
[01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:21.180]  awareness.
[01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:23.180]  I'll tell you another thing I noticed about Instagram
[01:45:23.180 --> 01:45:27.900]  is I, when I go to like sporting like a Yankee game
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:28.720]  or something like that,
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:32.160]  I see people taking Instagrams and using Instagram
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:35.220]  more on their phone, more than I see them tweeting.
[01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:37.220]  Do you wanna hear something funny?
[01:45:37.220 --> 01:45:40.400]  Is that while we've been taping this podcast,
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:44.020]  about 20 people I work with have stopped by
[01:45:44.020 --> 01:45:46.420]  this conference room and taken pictures of me
[01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:49.300]  through the glass, and I bet they're gonna wind up
[01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:51.260]  on Instagram and not on Twitter.
[01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:53.740]  If you see them, send them to me.
[01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:54.580]  Yeah, I will.
[01:45:54.580 --> 01:45:55.420]  We'll put them together and show them.
[01:45:55.420 --> 01:45:56.620]  Yeah, it's been very strange.
[01:45:56.620 --> 01:45:57.940]  Like, you know, the first couple, I was like,
[01:45:57.940 --> 01:46:00.940]  aha, very funny, and like 10 people
[01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:02.420]  have taken pictures of me.
[01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:06.260]  But anyway, my bigger point is like Twitter and Instagram
[01:46:06.260 --> 01:46:07.660]  are not really the same thing.
[01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:11.940]  I mean, Twitter is like breaking news from the fronts,
[01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:16.860]  you know, the war fronts in Ferguson,
[01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:18.500]  although I guess Instagram, you know,
[01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:20.460]  people were posting photos and that kind of stuff.
[01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:23.620]  But you know, Twitter is like the global pulse
[01:46:23.620 --> 01:46:26.380]  of information and Instagram is, you know,
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:28.580]  look how cool my life is, that kind of thing.
[01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:30.180]  So, comparing them.
[01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:32.900]  Or look at this, yeah, or look at this thing,
[01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:33.940]  or look at where I am.
[01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:34.960]  Yeah, here's where I am.
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:37.500]  If anything, Instagram has destroyed something
[01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:41.460]  like Foursquare more than it has really affected Twitter.
[01:46:41.460 --> 01:46:44.500]  And Twitter's problems are its own problems.
[01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:45.900]  You know, there are so many things
[01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:47.520]  that Twitter needs to figure out.
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:51.620]  But competing with Instagram, I don't think is the answer.
[01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:53.940]  And being upset that, you know,
[01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:56.700]  or people trying to make them look small
[01:46:56.700 --> 01:46:58.580]  because Instagram has more users,
[01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:00.340]  I don't think that has anything to do with it.
[01:47:00.340 --> 01:47:02.940]  Yeah, like I said, it's the same concept.
[01:47:02.940 --> 01:47:07.260]  It's just you pick a list of people, or certain companies,
[01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:10.140]  and you'll see a chronological stream of what they post.
[01:47:10.140 --> 01:47:12.380]  Same concept as Twitter, but in practice,
[01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:14.860]  because of the differences in what it is,
[01:47:14.860 --> 01:47:17.620]  you know, photos versus text, it ends up having
[01:47:17.620 --> 01:47:19.540]  a very different purpose.
[01:47:19.540 --> 01:47:20.800]  And this fact, what you just said,
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:22.020]  is actually kind of interesting,
[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:24.960]  because it's almost like Instagram is a better fulfillment
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:28.220]  of Twitter's original idea of its purpose.
[01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:30.180]  What am I doing right now?
[01:47:30.180 --> 01:47:32.880]  Right, it used to be like, what was the original prompt
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:33.940]  for Twitter in a few months?
[01:47:33.940 --> 01:47:36.140]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:38.260]  It's like, what's up, or what are you doing?
[01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:39.580]  What's going on?
[01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:40.900]  Maybe that's what it is now.
[01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:42.940]  You know, and people used to tweet like in 2006.
[01:47:42.940 --> 01:47:43.860]  What's happening?
[01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:47.460]  Yeah, like at the dentist, or something like that.
[01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:48.300]  Yeah, totally.
[01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:50.420]  And like, nobody would tweet that anymore, right?
[01:47:50.420 --> 01:47:52.980]  Like, nobody's gonna tweet at the dentist,
[01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:54.920]  just those words.
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:55.760]  But, I would-
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:56.620]  You know who will?
[01:47:56.620 --> 01:47:58.020]  Steve Wozniak will.
[01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:02.660]  But I definitely see like, when I see like friends,
[01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:05.700]  I see friends who take like a first person perspective
[01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:07.860]  of their feet in the dentist chair.
[01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:10.580]  And it's like, oh, you know, hope he's feeling,
[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:12.060]  hope he doesn't have a bad, you know,
[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:14.460]  some kind of tooth problem.
[01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:16.140]  Yeah, totally.
[01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:18.020]  And it fits, you know, you don't mind it
[01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:20.280]  if you can compose it artistically.
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:21.500]  No, it's great. I said this week,
[01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:24.420]  when that news broke, and again, like you said,
[01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:26.260]  I don't think it's any kind of bad news for Twitter
[01:48:26.260 --> 01:48:27.400]  that Instagram's bigger.
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:29.780]  It's just an interesting sign.
[01:48:29.780 --> 01:48:32.380]  It just, you know, and doesn't mean
[01:48:32.380 --> 01:48:33.900]  that they're even more valuable than Twitter.
[01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:35.240]  It's just interesting.
[01:48:36.620 --> 01:48:39.680]  But I do think though, that part of their success
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:41.560]  is that they've kept that simplicity
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:46.180]  and there's like, they know, the people running Instagram
[01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:47.880]  and designing it and keeping it,
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:50.260]  they know exactly what it is, and they get it.
[01:48:50.260 --> 01:48:52.880]  Whereas to me, part of Twitter's problem in recent years
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:54.780]  is that the people running Twitter
[01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:56.860]  don't seem to get what Twitter is.
[01:48:57.740 --> 01:49:00.860]  They're just, they've seeming, to me, they seem lost.
[01:49:00.860 --> 01:49:03.700]  And I think part of it is that they have this ambition
[01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:06.560]  to be as big as Facebook.
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:11.560]  And I think the problem is that what Twitter is good for
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:14.640]  is fundamentally never gonna be as big
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:17.020]  and as profitable as what Facebook is.
[01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:19.740]  And so can you live with that?
[01:49:19.740 --> 01:49:23.260]  You know, why not, if you're still profitable?
[01:49:23.260 --> 01:49:24.940]  Yeah, I think that's a great way of putting it.
[01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:29.940]  Like, if you make, I don't know, toaster ovens,
[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:35.460]  and you find out that the toaster oven business
[01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:37.980]  is not as profitable as the automobile industry,
[01:49:37.980 --> 01:49:39.500]  should you start making cars?
[01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:41.500]  No, I don't, you know, just, you know,
[01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:43.820]  keep making good toaster ovens, you know,
[01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:47.100]  and just let it be the business that it is, you know?
[01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:50.460]  And I just think that Twitter is so obsessed with Facebook
[01:49:50.460 --> 01:49:53.660]  that they've lost their way, led a leadership level.
[01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:56.580]  Yeah, or, well, I don't know if it's,
[01:49:56.580 --> 01:49:59.820]  I don't know if they think that way internally.
[01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:03.940]  I think that the outside perspective,
[01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:06.200]  especially among the investor community is like,
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:08.500]  well, why isn't Twitter becoming as big as Facebook?
[01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:12.700]  Well, my evidence that I think that they do it internally
[01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:14.820]  is the way that first person, or not first person,
[01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:17.340]  first party Twitter clients,
[01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:18.940]  meaning if you go to twitter.com
[01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:20.460]  and you use the Twitter app,
[01:50:20.460 --> 01:50:23.500]  that your timeline now is no longer
[01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:26.380]  just the simple chronological order
[01:50:26.380 --> 01:50:28.540]  of here are the people you follow in their tweets,
[01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:30.220]  you know, that there's all sorts of other stuff
[01:50:30.220 --> 01:50:32.780]  that's injected in there, you know?
[01:50:32.780 --> 01:50:35.620]  Yeah, but I don't think that stems from
[01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:37.140]  trying to be more like Facebook.
[01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:39.520]  I think that is trying to solve the problem
[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:41.540]  that most people have a shitty timeline
[01:50:41.540 --> 01:50:43.760]  because they don't follow enough people.
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:45.340]  They signed up for Twitter.
[01:50:45.340 --> 01:50:47.080]  They maybe followed,
[01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:50.500]  auto followed the people that were suggested to them,
[01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:54.180]  but getting people to keep following more Twitter accounts
[01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:56.980]  is kind of essential to building a really great timeline.
[01:50:56.980 --> 01:50:58.180]  Like, I love my timeline.
[01:50:58.180 --> 01:51:02.760]  I also follow 3,300 people, you know,
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:04.500]  and I even run out of stuff to read.
[01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:07.560]  So how do you automatically like pre-install
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:09.760]  a really great timeline for someone
[01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:11.260]  that's based on what they like?
[01:51:11.260 --> 01:51:12.980]  And that's, I think that's what they're trying to get at
[01:51:12.980 --> 01:51:15.180]  with this algorithmic stuff.
[01:51:15.180 --> 01:51:17.020]  And what I would like to see from Twitter
[01:51:17.020 --> 01:51:20.500]  is exactly this like pre-installed kit.
[01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:22.500]  Like if you could go to the homepage and say,
[01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:24.900]  show me soccer Twitter right now, boom,
[01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:27.020]  and I'm following a thousand accounts
[01:51:27.020 --> 01:51:28.940]  that people are talking about really great soccer,
[01:51:28.940 --> 01:51:31.860]  or let me see tech media Twitter,
[01:51:31.860 --> 01:51:34.260]  you know, around an Apple event or something like that.
[01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:37.020]  Yeah, and don't be as simplistic as a hashtag, right?
[01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:38.060]  Like what they've got now is
[01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:40.900]  if you use the exact right hashtag, you can do it,
[01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:43.740]  but only if all the tweets are using the hashtag,
[01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:47.180]  whereas it seems, you know, Google,
[01:51:47.180 --> 01:51:50.860]  Google web search seems like existence proof
[01:51:50.860 --> 01:51:52.100]  that you could build something
[01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:54.740]  where you could just say soccer, like you said,
[01:51:54.740 --> 01:51:56.740]  and just get it figured out,
[01:51:56.740 --> 01:52:00.520]  like here's some great soccer tweets to follow.
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:02.900]  So I think that's what they're trying to get at.
[01:52:02.900 --> 01:52:07.280]  And, you know, as is typical for Twitter,
[01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:10.420]  the worst thing they ever do is explain themselves.
[01:52:10.420 --> 01:52:14.780]  So they've done a typically poor job explaining
[01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:16.580]  why they're doing any of this stuff.
[01:52:16.580 --> 01:52:19.140]  And, you know, and now with new,
[01:52:19.140 --> 01:52:21.740]  with yet another product leader,
[01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:23.940]  who knows what they're gonna keep working on,
[01:52:23.940 --> 01:52:26.420]  what they're not gonna keep doing.
[01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:29.900]  Although I will say the new guy in charge of product,
[01:52:29.900 --> 01:52:32.180]  Kevin has been there forever.
[01:52:32.180 --> 01:52:35.140]  And, you know, if there's anyone I as a user trust
[01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:37.620]  to not be a hoser, it's him.
[01:52:37.620 --> 01:52:41.660]  So let's, all right.
[01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:43.900]  Can't beat that.
[01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:44.720]  Yeah.
[01:52:46.540 --> 01:52:48.820]  Dan Fromer, thank you very much for your time.
[01:52:48.820 --> 01:52:49.700]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:52:49.700 --> 01:52:53.060]  Where can people find out more from Dan Fromer?
[01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:58.060]  Oh, follow me on Twitter, FromDome or on Instagram
[01:52:58.060 --> 01:53:01.620]  if you wanna see a cute dog photos, I guess.
[01:53:02.820 --> 01:53:04.820]  Yeah, those are the best places to follow me now.
[01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:08.960]  Right now I'm mostly writing at Quartz, which is qz.com.
[01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:12.820]  But you'll find all the best at FromDome.
[01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:15.260]  Linked from, linking to the Quartz stuff.
[01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:17.300]  Yeah, everything, everything I do, you know,
[01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:18.900]  wherever it is.
[01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:20.900]  Yeah, let's get you some Instagram followers.
[01:53:20.900 --> 01:53:23.960]  Yeah, oh, and they're getting rid of all the spam accounts.
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:27.340]  So we'll see how many spam followers I have.
[01:53:27.340 --> 01:53:29.660]  Ends up I was not following you on Instagram.
[01:53:29.660 --> 01:53:32.780]  Oh, I'm decent on Instagram.
[01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:33.620]  Yeah.
[01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:34.440]  It's a little braggy.
[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:37.380]  It's like, hey, look at me, I'm in Tokyo, but so what?
[01:53:37.380 --> 01:53:39.060]  You know, I think that's what it's for.
[01:53:39.060 --> 01:53:40.580]  Yeah, I agree, I like it.
[01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:41.980]  Yeah.
[01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:43.780]  See, I didn't know you were in Tokyo.
[01:53:43.780 --> 01:53:44.820]  I'm not right now, I was.
[01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:46.220]  I know, I'm looking at the pictures.
[01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:49.300]  Actually have some really great stories I'm working on
[01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:52.060]  from Tokyo that I was reporting in Tokyo
[01:53:52.060 --> 01:53:54.220]  that I'll be publishing over the next few weeks.
[01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:59.220]  I did two already, one was,
[01:53:59.220 --> 01:54:01.820]  did you see that new OK Go video?
[01:54:01.820 --> 01:54:04.320]  Yes, the one with the, that was shot from a drone?
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:05.160]  Yeah.
[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:05.980]  Yeah.
[01:54:05.980 --> 01:54:07.460]  So I went to, so I was in Tokyo,
[01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:10.260]  I think now three weeks ago, maybe something like that.
[01:54:10.260 --> 01:54:11.600]  So I emailed Honda and said,
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:14.660]  hey, can I ride one of those things?
[01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:18.180]  And so I got to meet the guy who invented it
[01:54:18.180 --> 01:54:20.480]  and ride around one of those little scooters.
[01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:23.760]  They're called a UniCub, and that was awesome.
[01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:25.140]  That was super fun.
[01:54:25.140 --> 01:54:27.020]  So if you search, well,
[01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:28.320]  I don't even know how you would find this.
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:31.300]  I should put a link on my website
[01:54:31.300 --> 01:54:33.420]  to these stories sooner than later.
[01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:37.020]  And another thing is, Toshiba,
[01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:40.060]  like most Japanese, old Japanese tech companies,
[01:54:40.060 --> 01:54:42.100]  is struggling with growth.
[01:54:43.020 --> 01:54:46.060]  So they took an old floppy disk factory
[01:54:46.060 --> 01:54:47.500]  in the suburbs of Tokyo
[01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:51.620]  and turned it into a clean room indoor lettuce farm.
[01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:54.480]  So I toured that and posted a bunch of photos of that.
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:55.500]  And that was super cool.
[01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:57.640]  I had to put on kind of a half bunny suit
[01:54:57.640 --> 01:55:00.140]  and sterilize my camera.
[01:55:01.780 --> 01:55:03.260]  But it was awesome.
[01:55:03.260 --> 01:55:04.180]  It's a great shot.
[01:55:04.180 --> 01:55:05.140]  Yeah, it was very cool.
[01:55:05.140 --> 01:55:09.200]  So that stuff is on my Instagram, I guess.
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:10.220]  Actually it is.
[01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:14.140]  And you can't link through to the stories
[01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:16.940]  because Instagram doesn't allow any links, but.
[01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:18.820]  Because they're not listening to Dan Frommer.
[01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:23.820]  Yeah, whatever.
