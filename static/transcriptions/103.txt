[00:00.000 --> 00:02.640]  You really want to talk about Cub's baseball, though, right?
[00:04.160 --> 00:07.440]  That's why we're here. Chicago Cub's 2015 National League champs.
[00:08.320 --> 00:13.760]  I got to tell you, I am delighted to have Joe Madden out of the ALE's.
[00:14.720 --> 00:20.160]  That guy, I think he's the best manager in baseball. I really do.
[00:20.800 --> 00:29.440]  Well, I heard similar things about Don Baylor, Dusty Baker, and Lu Penella before they signed
[00:29.440 --> 00:33.120]  on with the Cub's, too, so. Yeah, let's sweet Lou was a good manager.
[00:33.120 --> 00:41.680]  I think, I mean, he's got a certain style and intensity, but he was good manager with the Yankees.
[00:41.680 --> 00:47.680]  I thought he was a good manager with Seattle. He did actually succeed fairly well with the Cub's,
[00:47.680 --> 00:52.480]  but they also, you know, not every year. Yeah, well, they were better than the Cubs
[00:52.480 --> 00:59.760]  usually are, but they weren't, they never got up to good. No. No. It hurt me because Lu Penella,
[00:59.760 --> 01:08.080]  unless my memory is really shut, he was managing Seattle in 95 the year right before the Yankees
[01:08.080 --> 01:15.600]  started their dynasty. But he had a Mariners hat. Right. And, mattingly, it was mattingly's last
[01:15.600 --> 01:22.560]  season. And at first time, he got in the postseason. And he played mattingly, played great. He had a
[01:22.560 --> 01:28.880]  great series, but the Mariners won. And it just was salt in the wound that it was Yankee legend,
[01:28.880 --> 01:34.720]  Lu Penella down. Well, we'll see. I'm actually, so I'm actually going to CES for the first time.
[01:34.720 --> 01:39.440]  I remember this is something we talked about either a year or two ago. Yeah, I might actually put
[01:39.440 --> 01:44.800]  a little money on the Cubs. We'll see. Oh, yeah, you got to know. You got to do that. You got to
[01:44.800 --> 01:50.720]  make a prop bet. We're going to do it. Prop bets are fun for two reasons. One, you get great odds.
[01:50.720 --> 01:54.240]  I don't know what the Cubs are at, but I'll bet they're probably like 15 to one at least,
[01:54.240 --> 01:58.880]  maybe more. Something. I don't even know. Number two, you have the challenge of keeping track
[01:58.880 --> 02:05.200]  of that little piece of paper for about nine months. Right. And it's like, I don't even think they
[02:05.200 --> 02:10.960]  print them on the super high quality. It's like that heat transfer, you know, like regular
[02:10.960 --> 02:16.480]  paper receipts you get from retail stores. And if you like, leave it out in the sun or something,
[02:16.480 --> 02:20.720]  it'll fade to nothing. Or in your wallet for. Yeah, because the heat, you know, it's, so you,
[02:21.360 --> 02:25.760]  and I find that so weird because you would think, you know, you know, because you know, I guess
[02:25.760 --> 02:31.280]  it's because they don't lose if you, if you destroy your ticket, but breakage. Yeah, because I
[02:31.280 --> 02:38.880]  have. There we go. There's our Kickstarter casino receipts, uh, preserver kit. Yeah, bone print
[02:38.880 --> 02:43.440]  of the jet or something. Yeah, something's going to last. Yeah, you should get good odds on that.
[02:45.440 --> 02:51.760]  When did you decide to go to CES? A few weeks ago, it was presented as an option for me here at
[02:51.760 --> 02:58.240]  Quartz. And I've never been. And I figured this is the perfect year to go. You know, when I have the
[02:58.240 --> 03:03.600]  name of a big news agency behind me to get good meetings and that kind of stuff, but also
[03:03.600 --> 03:08.800]  work for a site that doesn't churn out, you know, hundreds of stories a day. So I won't have to
[03:09.360 --> 03:13.760]  file an article every half an hour. Yeah, that sounds like the way to do it. Yeah, it's going to be
[03:13.760 --> 03:19.680]  great. It's a perennial topic. It's like my, my second week of January topic every year on this show
[03:19.680 --> 03:25.440]  is boy, I thought last year I should maybe go to CES. One of these years I got to go and I didn't do
[03:25.440 --> 03:30.800]  it this year again. Yeah, I think that was us last year. I do it every year. I have the same thought.
[03:30.800 --> 03:36.000]  Well, I'll let you know how it is. And instead, it's, it's one of those things where my natural
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.440]  inclination towards procrastination is just fails because it's really you can't do it at the
[03:41.440 --> 03:45.920]  last, what you could do it at the last minute, but it's super expensive. Yeah, and it's kind of
[03:45.920 --> 03:50.880]  annoying like they make you book your hotels through their centralized system and the flights are
[03:51.520 --> 03:56.720]  expensive or sold out. So even, you know, not when I booked a month and a half out, it was still
[03:56.720 --> 04:02.320]  kind of annoying. But anyway, it's gonna be awesome. I'll bet there's a ton of people from New York
[04:02.320 --> 04:08.960]  ago. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I guess I think if you lived in, you know, Joe random city, like I'll bet
[04:08.960 --> 04:13.440]  Philadelphia's Vegas flights probably aren't that different that week because I bet there's not
[04:13.440 --> 04:19.840]  that many people from here that go. But the hotels are mass. Yeah. Yeah. I can't wait to hear
[04:19.840 --> 04:23.120]  hear your report. Yeah, it's going to be great. No, and I totally think that's the way to do it
[04:23.120 --> 04:30.480]  is to do it as a publication that has a measured tone, not a bombardment of we got to have 30 posts
[04:30.480 --> 04:35.520]  a day. And, you know, yeah, it's funny. I was talking to someone from a large consumer electronics
[04:35.520 --> 04:39.600]  company the other day. And they're like, so are you coming to our press conference? You're coming
[04:39.600 --> 04:45.280]  to who are media day. And I'm like, nope, I'm not even getting there until Tuesday after all that
[04:45.280 --> 04:52.640]  crap has already happened. That's the way to do it. Yeah. So no waiting in line for, you know,
[04:52.640 --> 04:59.840]  stupid, whatever they're going to show big, big TVs and home automation stuff probably I had no
[04:59.840 --> 05:05.840]  idea. Yeah, that's a good question. I wonder what the big thing will be TVs are always I think
[05:05.840 --> 05:10.640]  my sense. Yeah, I mean, TVs, but my sense is that this is the year that all the connected home
[05:10.640 --> 05:20.720]  stuff starts to gel. So, you know, home automation stuff and refrigerators that talk to your pet
[05:20.720 --> 05:27.200]  about watches watches have got to be huge. Oh, yeah, watch these two because a and Apple watch aside
[05:28.480 --> 05:35.200]  Android Wear is out. It's a real thing. And it's already starting to accelerate where they're,
[05:35.200 --> 05:40.160]  you know, like when they first announced it back at at IO in June, there were two watches and they
[05:40.160 --> 05:48.000]  both were really clunky. I mean, they sucked. Then the Moto 360, or as I called the 270. Yeah.
[05:48.000 --> 05:52.960]  And and now there's been a trickle of watches that are that, you know, that seem reasonable. They
[05:52.960 --> 05:58.400]  seem like something that people might want to consider. Yeah, we'll see that that'll be interesting.
[05:59.840 --> 06:06.800]  I've gotten a few pitches on like shirts that have sensors built in so you can measure your
[06:06.800 --> 06:12.480]  heart rate through your shirt. So we'll see about that. Yeah, because the other thing that I think
[06:12.480 --> 06:18.160]  makes it has to be watches is is then going back to Apple watch with Apple watch on Verizon. Yeah,
[06:18.160 --> 06:24.080]  and we're clearly not going to hear anything new about Apple watch before CES. Right. And probably
[06:24.080 --> 06:29.760]  not during either unless they do one of those silly Apple leak type things. Right. But that means
[06:29.760 --> 06:36.720]  any consumer electronics company that wants to bet on smart watches because Apple, you know,
[06:36.720 --> 06:40.960]  it's right betting on what Apple is interested in is a pretty good way forward.
[06:40.960 --> 06:46.000]  And they're going to want to get that stuff out before as soon as they can. Right. So that's the
[06:46.000 --> 06:52.080]  part H piece chance to show off this late in Steve bombers last keynote or whatever. Right.
[06:54.560 --> 07:00.720]  Sweet. Yeah, I have a little bit of follow up from previous episodes of this of this broadcast.
[07:02.000 --> 07:06.240]  Star Wars follow up. A little bit of Star Wars follow up. I have to go all the way back to the
[07:06.240 --> 07:14.640]  Merlin episode, which was 99. Yeah, that was four episodes ago. So we talked about Roman numerals in
[07:14.640 --> 07:20.800]  the Super Bowl. And then in a subsequent week, followed up that they are the NFL is indeed dropping
[07:20.800 --> 07:28.080]  the Roman numerals for not this year Super Bowl next year's 50, which would have been just L. And that
[07:28.080 --> 07:35.120]  looks stupid. So they're just going to put Super Bowl five zero. And I was happy. But it ends up,
[07:35.120 --> 07:39.840]  they're only doing that for Super Bowl 50 because they all look so stupid. Starting with Super
[07:39.840 --> 07:45.040]  Bowl 51, they're going back to the stupid Roman numerals. So bad news on the Roman numerals.
[07:48.240 --> 07:53.840]  Star Wars. I don't think I have any follow up on Star Wars. Although there was, I saw a really funny
[07:54.640 --> 08:01.680]  bit from Stephen Colbert defending the new Sith lightsaber. Oh, nice. I'll put it in the show notes,
[08:01.680 --> 08:07.680]  but it was it's really, really funny. What do you think of it? Well, I don't really know much about
[08:07.680 --> 08:16.320]  Star Wars. I know. I'm sorry. Although, so my first exposure, I don't know, my dad showed me
[08:16.320 --> 08:21.200]  Caddy's shack and those types of movies instead. So we were like a Zappa household, not a,
[08:22.240 --> 08:30.240]  not a Beatles household. So, but the first time ever, so Star Wars was when they re-released them
[08:30.240 --> 08:36.160]  in the mid 90s on probably the biggest screen that existed in Chicago at that point at this
[08:36.160 --> 08:41.280]  movie theater downtown called McClure Court that was like, you know, five times bigger than any other
[08:41.280 --> 08:46.320]  movie screen. So that was kind of cool. And we went and saw those. And I've seen that,
[08:46.320 --> 08:53.920]  and I've still never seen Jedi. I'm bad. I need to do this at some point. That's crazy. Sorry.
[08:53.920 --> 08:59.120]  I saw, I saw like an idiot now. Anyway, I, I don't know what I was going to say,
[08:59.120 --> 09:03.760]  but I, I thought the new lightsaber looks fine. That's crazy. You don't have an opinion.
[09:03.760 --> 09:07.200]  You, you're. I have no opinion. No, it's just not count. I have no opinion. All right.
[09:07.200 --> 09:12.800]  The other bit of, um, sorry, follow up. And this is really my new ship. But why not? Let's be,
[09:12.800 --> 09:18.560]  let's be precise. Is, and last week's episode of Whiscus, we were talking about Bond movies,
[09:18.560 --> 09:25.200]  and, uh, and I brought up that the, uh, Lazenby one, uh, on her Majesty's Secret Service.
[09:25.200 --> 09:30.400]  Uh, Dave was under the impression that it was universally everybody hated it, everybody knew
[09:30.400 --> 09:35.040]  it was a mistake. And it turns out, I am correct on this, that it's very divisive. Most people
[09:35.040 --> 09:40.640]  seem not to like it. Man, I agree. It was, it was a dud. But there's a fairly sizable contingent
[09:40.640 --> 09:44.720]  of Bond movie fans who, who either think it's their favorite or one of their favorites, one of
[09:44.720 --> 09:50.400]  the better ones. And, uh, I have not seen that one. Is it what it's polarizing about it? Well,
[09:50.400 --> 09:59.680]  I think it's, I think it's, uh, a weird story. I think, I think Lazenby's take on the character
[09:59.680 --> 10:05.120]  was off. I just, I just don't buy him as Bond. Other people think he's great, though. It's,
[10:05.120 --> 10:11.920]  it's, you know, he's definitely not Sean Connery. That's for sure. And, and, uh, I don't know.
[10:11.920 --> 10:15.200]  And there's something about the story, the way the story's written, that I just think it's,
[10:15.200 --> 10:20.560]  it's a dud. But some people really like the, the direction. Some people think the action sequences
[10:21.280 --> 10:28.480]  are, are some of the best of that era. Um, and I think, I think his name is Peter Hunt. And in the
[10:28.480 --> 10:36.080]  earlier movies, he was, um, the editor of the movies. And he got to direct this one. And some people
[10:36.080 --> 10:41.520]  think that that helped make the action sequences better because he knew how to shoot them to give
[10:41.520 --> 10:46.960]  the editing, the footage that they would need, you know, that an editor's perspective on directing
[10:46.960 --> 10:52.240]  makes for better action sequences. Film Crit Hulk, do you ever read Film Crit Hulk? I don't, but I am
[10:52.240 --> 10:58.000]  aware of it. And I appreciate its existence. Uh, he's, he's a big fan. He did a thing where he wrote
[10:58.000 --> 11:02.800]  about all the Bond movies. And he really like, Oh, cool. Anyway, friend of the show, Nat Irons, um,
[11:03.440 --> 11:08.240]  I think he's at Nat Irons on Twitter. Great guy works at Black Pixel, really smart guy,
[11:08.240 --> 11:13.600]  long time friend of the show, long time during Fireball Reader. I mean, like, back in 2002,
[11:13.600 --> 11:18.560]  this guy have sent me, uh, typos and stuff like that. Great guy. I said it was his favorite
[11:18.560 --> 11:23.840]  Bond movie. And in fact, he corrected at me on Twitter, said it is in his top six. He is a fan
[11:23.840 --> 11:27.600]  of the movie, but he would not, he would not call it his favorite. And I wouldn't want to be
[11:27.600 --> 11:33.760]  smart somebody in such a way. So let's clear the record for, uh, for Nat. Oh, and the last thing,
[11:33.760 --> 11:40.960]  Whiscus made a mistake. Uh, the Chris Cornell song, uh, I forget the name of it, but it was the
[11:40.960 --> 11:46.480]  theme of, it was not the theme of quantum of solace. That was the theme for casino royale.
[11:47.600 --> 11:52.480]  Uh, and I don't know. I was tired or something to let it slide. I didn't catch it when Whiscus made
[11:52.480 --> 11:57.920]  that mistake. Uh, the theme for quantum of solace was the Jack White one, which was kind of weird.
[11:57.920 --> 12:04.480]  You've watched. Yeah, I haven't seen that one for a while though. I've watched in the old ones.
[12:04.480 --> 12:08.880]  You have seen James Bond movies. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've been watching the old ones. Um, I,
[12:08.880 --> 12:13.280]  you know, I started seeing all the nuances that come out and I'd never seen the old ones. And then
[12:13.920 --> 12:19.440]  after you and Dan started doing the shows, I started watching them and actually, uh, you know,
[12:19.440 --> 12:24.000]  as you know, they're so annoying to stream. So I've had to end up buying a bunch of them. But,
[12:24.000 --> 12:29.120]  yeah, yeah, I dig them. This streaming rights on those Bond movies are the craziest thing in the
[12:29.120 --> 12:33.280]  world. Like, uh, it's somebody twitted me the other day that a bunch of the connery ones are back
[12:33.280 --> 12:37.360]  on Netflix, but they're not all of them. There's an, and they're all, and I think a bunch of our
[12:37.360 --> 12:43.200]  HBO go, which is where I watched one recently, but not all of them, not all of them. And not the ones
[12:43.200 --> 12:49.200]  I wanted to watch. So I was like, well, okay. Yeah, who knows what those negotiations are like,
[12:49.200 --> 12:52.800]  but you would just think though that it would be like a blanket deal because they're all one
[12:52.800 --> 13:00.160]  company? You all accept for never say never again, which is a entirely separate long story about
[13:00.160 --> 13:05.200]  that would exist, but all the other Bond movies are from Yann productions, Yann, right,
[13:05.200 --> 13:12.720]  the abbreviation, everything or nothing. Uh, so it's just bizarre. It must just be that, you know,
[13:12.720 --> 13:20.000]  that's in which conglomerate owns those. Is it Sony or one of those used to be who owns MGM now?
[13:20.000 --> 13:26.240]  No. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. Well, it's, but anyway, it's crazy. It's very
[13:26.240 --> 13:30.400]  nice. Now you'll have more followers. Sorry, man. I think it's one of those things like,
[13:31.520 --> 13:35.520]  it's like like buttered, like a piece of buttered toast is always going to land face down. It's
[13:35.520 --> 13:39.440]  like whatever Bond movie you're in the mood to watch is always not going to be available for free
[13:39.440 --> 13:44.960]  on Netflix. Totally. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, why don't I just take a break right here and do the first
[13:44.960 --> 13:50.320]  sponsor read and it will get started on the perfect. Uh, and it's a brand new sponsor. I am very,
[13:50.880 --> 14:00.880]  uh, excited about this. Uh, it's called Hello H U L L O. I think it's how, uh, uh, Bilbo used to say
[14:00.880 --> 14:08.400]  hello in the Lord of the Rings movies. Uh, have you ever tried a buckwheat hole pillow?
[14:08.400 --> 14:15.360]  Have you, Dan? No. Well, I never even heard of such a thing, but popular for centuries throughout
[14:15.360 --> 14:20.880]  Asia, buckwheat pillows can form to your body and provide cool comfortable support.
[14:21.840 --> 14:27.280]  Uh, hello suits every person sleeping style. Are you a side sleeper, back sleeper, stomach sleeper?
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.440]  Hello can be adjusted to conform perfectly to the shape of your head and neck, providing ideal
[14:33.440 --> 14:38.080]  support that's just for you. I'm usually a back sleeper. I just sleep like, like I'm in a coffin.
[14:38.720 --> 14:45.920]  Sometimes I sleep on my stomach though. Who knows how I wake up? Uh, air flows freely through
[14:45.920 --> 14:51.680]  Hello's buckwheat hole fill, keeping it cool all night long. Uh, adjust the thickness to your
[14:51.680 --> 14:58.720]  personal preference by adding or removing the holes any time. It's made in the USA with quality
[14:58.720 --> 15:03.840]  construction and materials, uh, and improves on traditional buckwheat pillows by incorporating
[15:03.840 --> 15:12.400]  only the highest quality materials, pre shrunken, durable, twill cotton case, high quality,
[15:12.400 --> 15:19.280]  Dunlap, hidden zipper, and the buckwheat hole fill is grown and milled in North Dakota.
[15:20.400 --> 15:25.680]  Uh, it's an organically, organically friendly, uh, environmentally friendly, I should say,
[15:25.680 --> 15:32.160]  organic product, no chemical based phones or bird feathers, 100% unbleached certified
[15:32.160 --> 15:38.480]  organic cotton. Uh, these guys sent me one of these, or actually two, so we could uh, my wife and I
[15:38.480 --> 15:44.320]  could both try these out. And I opened it up and I thought that they were out of their
[15:44.320 --> 15:49.680]  freaking minds because it seemed as though I, it's like a, like a pillow stuffed full of coffee beans.
[15:50.080 --> 15:54.400]  I don't, I mean, it's, it is definitely not like a normal pillow. It is entirely different.
[15:54.400 --> 16:01.920]  Uh, it's not like, oh, wow, that's weird that a pillow full of holes, uh, buckwheat holes would
[16:01.920 --> 16:06.960]  feel like a pillow. It doesn't feel like a normal pillows, very heavy, much heavier. Um, and it
[16:06.960 --> 16:11.600]  makes a crinkly sound definitely has a sound like you're sleeping on a, uh, a bag, like I said,
[16:11.600 --> 16:16.720]  a bag full of coffee beans, uh, figured I'd try it out though. And that was like two weeks ago,
[16:16.720 --> 16:22.560]  and I've still got it on my bed. It's pretty cool. Uh, I still, every, I wake up every morning
[16:22.560 --> 16:26.800]  though, I still think, man, this pillow is wild, but I like it. It's definitely, uh, it gives me a
[16:26.800 --> 16:32.560]  better night's sleep than I had with a regular pillow. Um, not at all like memory foam. Every
[16:32.560 --> 16:36.960]  see that I don't, I don't really care for the memory foam pillows. They seem like the weird, the way
[16:36.960 --> 16:41.760]  they conform to your head. This thing, the conforming to your head, it's not, it's not at all like a
[16:41.760 --> 16:48.320]  foam or anything like that. It's just like sleeping on a bag of beans. I don't know. It's nature.
[16:48.320 --> 16:54.320]  Yeah. So here's the deal. Sounds crazy. It seems like a weird thing you'd buy off a podcast,
[16:54.320 --> 17:00.080]  but here's their deal. You try it for 60 nights. And if you're not satisfied, they will give you
[17:00.080 --> 17:08.480]  a full refund. No questions asked. So you can do this. Um, the small ones are 49 bucks, uh,
[17:09.200 --> 17:15.120]  standard is 79 king size, 129. So they're not cheap, but you can save money on each additional one.
[17:15.120 --> 17:22.880]  You can save, uh, 510 or 20 on each additional one that you buy. And it's 60 days. No risk.
[17:22.880 --> 17:27.520]  No questions asked money back. So if you've got any curiosity in this and you're thinking,
[17:27.520 --> 17:35.440]  that sounds crazy. The grouper says it works. Just go try it, sign up, buy the thing. And if you
[17:35.440 --> 17:40.480]  don't like it, just send it back to them for free. You don't have to pay a damn thing. So try it.
[17:40.480 --> 17:48.720]  Here's where you go to find out more. Hello, pillow H U L L O pillow P I O O O W dot com,
[17:49.360 --> 17:56.560]  slash talk show, just slash talk show. Uh, and the last bit 1% of all of their profits are
[17:56.560 --> 18:03.600]  contributed to the nature Conservancy. So my thanks to hello, pillow, give them a try. It's really
[18:03.600 --> 18:09.200]  crazy. I really, I thought it was being pranked when I first opened the box. Sounds cool. Yeah,
[18:09.200 --> 18:14.080]  it worked. Gluten free. First thing I want to talk about, I want to talk about this thing,
[18:14.080 --> 18:22.000]  uh, I sent you the link. It was a article by Eric Jackson writing at, uh, uh, I was confused
[18:22.000 --> 18:27.360]  Forbes and Fortune. I think it was Forbes. It's Forbes. Yeah. And as a former Forbes employee,
[18:27.360 --> 18:33.200]  we love it when you confuse Forbes and Fortune. I, I, you know what, I just did it the other day
[18:33.920 --> 18:38.960]  with there was a story by a fortune writer and I of course attributed to Forbes. It really is
[18:38.960 --> 18:47.200]  as simple as in my mind. They're both business magazines and they start F O R. Yup. And that's it.
[18:47.200 --> 18:52.160]  That's just how my mind files him away. Just remember that Fortune is the boring one. And, uh,
[18:53.440 --> 18:58.320]  it's like the index in my mind, like the hashing index. It only adds like three letters. Yeah,
[18:58.320 --> 19:05.520]  it only goes to F O R. And there's, anyway. Um, now he cut, you wrote about this earlier in the year
[19:05.520 --> 19:13.120]  two and then I politely rebutted it. But his point is he, he wants to see Apple, uh, use their
[19:13.120 --> 19:20.000]  massive cash reserves to make big acquisitions. And my take earlier in the year was more or less
[19:20.000 --> 19:25.120]  that he was saying just do something with their money and with, which seems to me, it'll advise
[19:25.120 --> 19:30.080]  like it seems to me like he's articulating an a viewpoint that Apple has to do something with this
[19:30.080 --> 19:36.640]  money. And you know, I, I just disagree. I think doing, just doing something for the sake of doing
[19:36.640 --> 19:41.040]  something is going to lead to distractions. So he has a followup. He just posted it was at the very
[19:41.040 --> 19:47.520]  end of the month. There was like over Thanksgiving. Um, and to summarize, I would say he's,
[19:47.520 --> 19:52.080]  he thinks that the, uh, what they are doing with their money with the stock buybacks, which is,
[19:52.080 --> 19:55.920]  I think most, I think it's about 70% of what they're doing. And then the, uh, the dividends that
[19:55.920 --> 20:02.160]  they're now paying are a waste of money and that they, they're not really that the, the stock
[20:02.160 --> 20:08.160]  rise that we've seen since Apple's instituted this would have happened anyway. Um, just because
[20:08.160 --> 20:13.520]  Apple's financials are doing better and the, the, they, they're not going to be able to survive
[20:13.520 --> 20:18.080]  without Steve Jobs fear that might have been depressing. The stock is gone. Nobody really seems to
[20:18.080 --> 20:23.040]  think that they're in bad hands under Tim Cook's leadership anymore. Um, which I think everybody would
[20:23.040 --> 20:29.120]  agree with that. Um, so what he thinks they should do, even, he doesn't think they should have
[20:29.120 --> 20:33.520]  done that. And what he thinks they should do now is he, and he's, I think he's dead serious about
[20:33.520 --> 20:40.400]  this. He thinks they should buy Tesla, which he thinks would cost about 45 billion Twitter,
[20:40.400 --> 20:48.080]  which would be about 40 billion by Pinterest for 15 billion, uh, then spend 10 billion on better
[20:48.080 --> 20:54.400]  batteries through R and D and spend 10 billion, um, to make iCloud work properly.
[20:55.920 --> 21:03.760]  So what, what do you think about that? Uh, so, and this, and this also happens. So I also
[21:03.760 --> 21:08.560]  published a story today Friday, um, called, you know, whatever 10 things I learned about Apple this
[21:08.560 --> 21:14.400]  year on courts. And one of the, you know, one of the things I touched on is, it was a little
[21:14.400 --> 21:20.960]  commentary about Apple's, uh, you know, basically doing their first big buy ever this year,
[21:20.960 --> 21:26.960]  which was Beats, uh, audio and Beats music and her Beats electronics or whatever it's called,
[21:26.960 --> 21:34.240]  um, which was $3 billion, which is not 40 billion, but it's still pretty big. Um, and, you know,
[21:34.240 --> 21:40.800]  with the context of people over the years saying Apple should buy all these companies, uh,
[21:40.800 --> 21:45.440]  the, the one that's been thrown about a lot actually, uh, in years past was Adobe that Apple
[21:45.440 --> 21:52.720]  should buy Adobe so that it owns the, uh, you know, professional desktop, uh, software market.
[21:52.720 --> 21:58.880]  And of, and one of the articles I found while researching this was during fireball,
[21:58.880 --> 22:05.920]  14 May 2008, why Apple won't buy Adobe? And I think the, the poster you wrote here, if you could,
[22:05.920 --> 22:12.640]  if you want to do a, a find in replace with, with almost every company on that list, um,
[22:12.640 --> 22:18.000]  you know, you could pretty much paste it in there. Uh, you know, and, and then you also made a,
[22:18.000 --> 22:23.200]  you've also written about, you know, why Apple buying Tesla wouldn't necessarily be the
[22:23.200 --> 22:30.000]  craziest thing because it kind of fits, um, fits the model a little bit of what they do. But,
[22:30.000 --> 22:35.440]  you know, if you look at, at Pinterest and Twitter and Tesla, first of all, you can't buy
[22:35.440 --> 22:39.360]  three companies that big of the same time. I don't think that's even possible from a
[22:39.360 --> 22:45.680]  logistical or regulatory standpoint. Like imagine a few announced $100 billion in acquisitions in
[22:45.680 --> 22:52.880]  a week. My guess is that the, the, uh, government would say, uh, yeah, very funny. Uh, okay,
[22:52.880 --> 22:57.600]  now we're going to make you wait for two years while we sift through all this stuff. Yeah,
[22:57.600 --> 23:02.880]  there's, let's, so beyond that. And yeah, let's just put that aside for now. But I do agree with
[23:02.880 --> 23:08.000]  you. And in particular, for example, I think that trying to acquire Twitter and Pinterest simultaneously
[23:08.000 --> 23:15.920]  would definitely be very complicated, getting approval much more complicated than buying one of them
[23:16.720 --> 23:21.680]  or the other. Right. More than twice as complicated because it would be seen as, and, you know,
[23:21.680 --> 23:26.880]  anti-competitive because in some ways Pinterest is a social network. Yeah. And therefore it
[23:26.880 --> 23:32.160]  competes with Twitter. But beyond that, even if you had like, you know, even if all that stuff was,
[23:32.160 --> 23:38.560]  was totally doable, then you're Apple, and you have to integrate Pinterest and Twitter into your
[23:38.560 --> 23:44.640]  company and, you know, first of all, how and second of all, why? Like, what do you, you know,
[23:44.640 --> 23:49.200]  what do you do with that? And it just seems to me like that is not what Tim Cook needs to be doing
[23:49.200 --> 23:56.000]  right now. Um, what, you know, Twitter is not going to change Apple in a way that would make it,
[23:56.000 --> 24:00.880]  you know, solve all of its problems. I think there are, there are much, much bigger problems at Apple
[24:00.880 --> 24:07.120]  that have nothing to do with spending cash to acquire new companies that have some relation to,
[24:07.120 --> 24:13.280]  you know, potential future businesses for Apple or something like that. Yeah. I, yeah. The
[24:13.280 --> 24:19.200]  why is the bigger question than the how? Because the easiest answer is to how would be to acquire
[24:19.200 --> 24:24.720]  them and kind of let them run independently. But then, you know, I mean, like, they're, how to me
[24:24.720 --> 24:29.440]  has some solutions. It's why though is the, is the first question. Right. Which, by the way, is,
[24:29.440 --> 24:34.640]  is harder than it sounds because the people who made Pinterest in 12, maybe not Twitter,
[24:34.640 --> 24:39.360]  but the people who made Pinterest what it is, don't necessarily want to keep making it under the
[24:39.360 --> 24:45.360]  ownership of a bigger company. So this is a very common problem. Anyway, the why is is ultimately
[24:45.360 --> 24:52.000]  more interesting for the why not? Because I don't see how owning Twitter or let's just focus on
[24:52.000 --> 24:58.480]  Twitter, but owning, because owning Twitter to me doesn't help Apple do anything that Apple already
[24:58.480 --> 25:05.040]  does. There's no, it solves nothing. It, you know, that in terms of Apple's core businesses,
[25:05.040 --> 25:14.080]  which is really selling computing hardware and now in a ray of form factors, traditional PCs and
[25:14.080 --> 25:23.120]  laptops, tablets and, of course, cell phones and coming soon, the watch, which are all computers.
[25:23.120 --> 25:27.040]  That's really, you know, fundamentally, that's what Apple does is they make computers and the way that
[25:27.040 --> 25:36.560]  they succeed is by making computers that are the best in the world as perceived by a significant
[25:36.560 --> 25:43.920]  number of people who are therefore willing to pay a premium for them. And to me, that's Apple
[25:43.920 --> 25:49.280]  in a nutshell. And there's almost nothing that the company does that matters that isn't in service
[25:49.280 --> 25:55.920]  of that. Which is why it has all this cash to spend in the first place. So for example,
[25:55.920 --> 26:00.080]  yeah, exactly. And that's how they got all this cash. So for example, the whole thing of items
[26:01.600 --> 26:07.280]  isn't at first, at least at like a one level of interaction has nothing to do with selling computers.
[26:07.920 --> 26:16.240]  But I think like two levels of interaction, it does because one type of computer that's no longer
[26:16.240 --> 26:22.480]  really a significant part of the company's business, but one type of computer is iPods, computers that
[26:22.480 --> 26:30.240]  are computing devices that are meant as portable music and video players. And to sell those,
[26:30.240 --> 26:36.240]  it really, really helped. I would say it was essential to make it easy to buy content for them.
[26:36.720 --> 26:39.040]  Therefore, that's why iTunes exists.
[26:40.080 --> 26:45.520]  And I think you're selling iTunes a little short. I mean, at its peak of utility in the early 2000s,
[26:45.520 --> 26:52.640]  like it was way easier to use than Winamp or something like that for managing a music librarian
[26:52.640 --> 26:59.600]  and ripping CDs and that sort of stuff. And then, you know, arguably more importantly, it became
[26:59.600 --> 27:07.840]  the home of sync, of syncing your devices to each other to your iPod and eventually your iPhone
[27:07.840 --> 27:13.920]  to your Mac, which, you know, that's a really great place to be. If you can, I will always
[27:13.920 --> 27:18.000]  a Michael Gartenberg, I think, once tweeted to something. If you own sync, you own everything.
[27:18.000 --> 27:21.440]  Yeah. I don't know. Something like that. And, you know, and that's what iCloud is supposed to do
[27:21.440 --> 27:28.080]  right now. So iTunes actually probably sold a lot of Macs, I would say. Yeah. And I don't mean
[27:28.080 --> 27:33.760]  to sell it short. But it's all in service of selling, selling Mac, selling iPods, selling phones,
[27:33.760 --> 27:40.560]  you know, right. Definitely that they had the infrastructure in place, both the cloud infrastructure
[27:40.560 --> 27:47.040]  of having the store and the cloud servers that could send content over and could do activation.
[27:47.040 --> 27:52.720]  Remember, you still have to activate your phone, your iPhone through iTunes. And the desktop
[27:52.720 --> 27:59.680]  software, which was on hundreds of millions of Macs and Windows PCs, it let them ship the iPhone sooner
[27:59.680 --> 28:03.280]  than they would have been able to otherwise if they didn't have it in place. Because for years,
[28:03.280 --> 28:07.680]  you know, three or four more years before iCloud really became an independent thing,
[28:07.680 --> 28:12.480]  you'd really, you know, they needed it to have the, you know, just for things like software update.
[28:13.840 --> 28:17.840]  They didn't have the infrastructure in place to do over the Air software updates to the iPhone.
[28:17.840 --> 28:21.680]  And so if they wanted to do what they definitely wanted to do, which was
[28:22.960 --> 28:27.120]  control the software updates to the phone as opposed to the carrier, they needed iTunes for it.
[28:27.120 --> 28:31.280]  So I'm not trying to sell it short. I'm just saying, no, it was in service of that fundamental
[28:31.280 --> 28:35.920]  business of selling the best computing devices in the world. Yeah. And now that, of course, the
[28:35.920 --> 28:44.000]  acquisitionist would say, well, now Apple should buy Spotify because that's the future iTunes.
[28:44.000 --> 28:49.120]  So why doesn't Apple just spend the cash that it has by Spotify? That's the, that,
[28:49.120 --> 28:52.640]  that I would not disagree with. I don't think they have to buy Spotify. I don't think they
[28:52.640 --> 28:59.920]  have to buy rather than build their own streaming music solution. But if the news came out,
[28:59.920 --> 29:04.640]  you know, after we, you and I get off this show and the news comes out late on Friday,
[29:04.640 --> 29:08.880]  that Apple isn't, you know, made an offer to buy Spotify. I wouldn't be surprised at all.
[29:08.880 --> 29:15.840]  Would you? Well, I was just making fun of it. So I made really? I don't, I think about it.
[29:15.840 --> 29:21.360]  No, well, I might be surprised. I wouldn't be shocked because it wouldn't seem out of character.
[29:21.360 --> 29:24.400]  Right. In the same way that beats, beats was definitely a surprise.
[29:26.560 --> 29:33.040]  But it, you know, it doesn't seem totally out of character. Right. And Spotify, like,
[29:33.040 --> 29:38.400]  it has, it seems to have survived long enough to actually be something important on its own,
[29:39.360 --> 29:45.520]  both in terms of, you know, usage and kind of a community and the product that it's built.
[29:45.520 --> 29:50.240]  So, yeah, that wouldn't, you know, I don't know if, yeah, I guess the question is like,
[29:50.240 --> 29:55.840]  okay, does that, yeah, then there's all these dark questions like, does that become the iTunes app?
[29:55.840 --> 29:58.880]  Or does it, yeah, Spotify? I don't, you know, I don't know the answer to that. And,
[29:58.880 --> 30:07.200]  I don't know if that even matters. But, yeah, I think that, like, something like that,
[30:07.200 --> 30:12.880]  which, you know, the question for all these deals would be like, if, even if Apple shut
[30:12.880 --> 30:17.360]  all the Android users off of these products in the planet, you know, and made them,
[30:17.360 --> 30:23.360]  I've Apple only, does that make the Apple product that much better that people would buy that
[30:23.360 --> 30:30.400]  instead of something else? No, I mean, and they could, the outcry, if they bought Twitter and
[30:30.400 --> 30:36.640]  made it Apple only, it would, you know, the outcry would be phenomenal. I mean, it would lose most of
[30:36.640 --> 30:44.400]  its users. I would guess a majority, some majority of Twitter users are, you know, using devices,
[30:44.400 --> 30:50.160]  or at least one device that's not an Apple product, it just wouldn't even, you know, I don't
[30:50.160 --> 30:54.880]  know, why would you buy it if you're just going to, or win the web, or the web, right? Yeah, even
[30:54.880 --> 31:00.960]  just the web. It just, you know, and then what would be the point? It just, it almost seems like,
[31:00.960 --> 31:05.360]  to me, buying Twitter would just be the, it would be a sign that Apple sees itself now as,
[31:05.360 --> 31:10.880]  like, a conglomerate, you know, like, Berkshire Hathaway, where they just buy companies and they're
[31:10.880 --> 31:17.680]  like a meta company on top of them. Right. And I'm not like an expert in kind of financial
[31:17.680 --> 31:23.280]  tricks and that kind of stuff, but someone explained to me, buybacks the other day as, you know,
[31:23.280 --> 31:28.240]  if you have this money and you think that the best investment you can make is in yourself,
[31:28.240 --> 31:33.360]  if you think that Apple shares are going to go up, then that's probably the best investment you
[31:33.360 --> 31:37.680]  can make and just, you know, buy your own shares instead of buying shares and something else.
[31:37.680 --> 31:48.160]  Yeah, I've read that too. That's, it's very close to Warren Buffett, speaking of Berkshire Hathaway,
[31:48.160 --> 31:55.120]  Warren Buffett's advice and take on buybacks is that it's, you know, it's like most of his stock
[31:55.120 --> 31:59.120]  advice. And again, I'm no expert, but it's, you know, it's as simple as that, that if you,
[32:00.400 --> 32:04.640]  if you think, yeah, exactly what you said, if you think that your stock is underpriced,
[32:04.640 --> 32:11.120]  then it's, you know, it's a good buy. It's a good, it's a good use of your money that it actually
[32:11.120 --> 32:17.120]  does help your shareholders and inflate the value of the company. And who better than the leadership
[32:17.120 --> 32:22.080]  of Apple to have a sense as to whether they think that their stock is underpriced.
[32:22.080 --> 32:29.280]  Right. Right. I mean, and this is again an area where I'm not like an expert, but,
[32:30.080 --> 32:34.240]  you know, finance reporters that I've talked to have said that Tim Cook has actually
[32:34.240 --> 32:41.520]  done a really good job at converting Apple from being a, you know, fast growth, growth, growth
[32:41.520 --> 32:47.520]  growth company to more of a blue chip where, yeah, it does have a dividend and buys back its shares
[32:47.520 --> 32:51.760]  and, you know, does things with its cash that a growth company probably wouldn't do,
[32:52.720 --> 32:58.800]  but that, you know, big institutional investors really respect the way that Tim Cook has done that.
[32:58.800 --> 33:04.880]  Yeah. And it's, I do, I, as an outside observer who follows Apple mostly from the product and
[33:04.880 --> 33:12.400]  designs side, not the business side. Um, you know, I completely agree with that. And it does feel
[33:12.400 --> 33:17.920]  like, like the stock has settled because the market as a whole has accepted that transition,
[33:17.920 --> 33:24.000]  that they're not looking for. I don't see people trying to, to figure out ways to make Apple
[33:24.000 --> 33:30.800]  watch an iPhone size business in any near term future. You know, it seems like expectations
[33:30.800 --> 33:37.760]  are reasonable. Whereas like two years ago, I feel like if they had announced what the watch then
[33:39.040 --> 33:44.080]  expectations would have been too, too wild because people, you know, business writers, people
[33:44.080 --> 33:50.240]  looking at it from a financial perspective, we're asking, how can Apple keep growing at this crazy
[33:50.240 --> 33:55.600]  rate that they've grown the last seven years? Especially having seen, you know, the first
[33:55.600 --> 34:00.400]  couple of years of the iPad come out right out of the gate super strong and look like maybe that
[34:00.400 --> 34:04.880]  was it, right? Right. And, and look like, oh, wow, this is going to be as big as the iPhone right
[34:04.880 --> 34:08.960]  away. And then, you know, okay, here comes the watch. Now it's got to be that big, too.
[34:09.680 --> 34:15.120]  Yeah. And I'm guilty as charged on that front. I, I'm on the record as speculated. I didn't pick
[34:15.120 --> 34:19.360]  a year, but I, I was on the record of saying that I thought an iPad would be a bigger business
[34:19.360 --> 34:25.920]  than iPhone soon, meaning, you know, by now. And clearly that was wrong. It's not, it's, it's settled
[34:25.920 --> 34:30.720]  in far lower. It's actually growth that stopped. That's not to say growth is stalled forever,
[34:30.720 --> 34:35.200]  but it's, you know, for about a year or maybe even longer, right? Didn't you account the course?
[34:35.200 --> 34:40.560]  Yeah. For the last six quarters, it's actually shrunk year over year. So this year, it will
[34:40.560 --> 34:45.680]  almost certainly be smaller than it was last year. Not even just slowing growth, but actually
[34:45.680 --> 34:51.840]  whereas shrinkage, whereas iPhone, which is older, is still continues to grow. They've never had
[34:51.840 --> 34:56.400]  a stronger launch than they did with the, the, this year's models. And of course, the iPod has
[34:56.400 --> 35:01.360]  been shrinking for several years. And, you know, until very recently, it was still a, you know,
[35:01.360 --> 35:08.000]  a non laughable business. So, you know, it's, it's perfectly reasonable for things to eventually
[35:08.000 --> 35:14.800]  decline, but I don't think anyone would have expected that the iPad, iPad would be in its decline
[35:14.800 --> 35:20.800]  already. And, you know, it's probably not permanent. I, I don't think that tablets are, you know,
[35:20.800 --> 35:26.240]  we're a, we're a fad. Yeah, I don't think so either. I think what it was, I've been thinking about
[35:26.240 --> 35:30.640]  this. And I know this is a little bit of an aside on, on this game of let's spend Apple's money,
[35:30.640 --> 35:35.920]  but we're going to spend Apple's money in a minute. So yeah, if we, you know, if we didn't have a
[35:35.920 --> 35:39.040]  long digression, it wouldn't really be the episode of the podcast. Absolutely.
[35:39.040 --> 35:50.400]  I, my, my gut feeling on the iPad sales stalling is that, uh, in the early years where it was
[35:50.400 --> 35:53.440]  growing and, and this is what made me think it was going to be bigger than iPhone. Is it in the
[35:53.440 --> 36:00.320]  first few years of iPad, it's like iPads year one was bigger than iPhones year one and iPads year
[36:00.320 --> 36:05.040]  two was bigger than iPhones year two. It never was bigger than iPhone, but it was bigger than the
[36:05.040 --> 36:12.880]  iPhone in 27, 28, 29, you know, in years one, two, three of iPad. And then it fell behind that
[36:12.880 --> 36:17.680]  curve. And I think that it's because the two markets are entirely different. The phone market
[36:17.680 --> 36:24.640]  is literally every person on the planet who can afford a phone. Like that's where we're headed
[36:24.640 --> 36:30.400]  is that however many billion people there are on the planet, if they are in a, you know, a country,
[36:30.400 --> 36:37.600]  you know, and it, you have, you know, 100 bucks and you can afford some monthly service charge,
[36:37.600 --> 36:42.320]  you're going to have a cell phone if you don't already. And it's, so it's an enormous market. It's
[36:42.320 --> 36:50.160]  almost capped by the number of people on the planet. Uh, and I think the market for tablets is
[36:50.160 --> 36:58.400]  really a sub market of the PC market. I think what it is, is, is that it's, it's really just part,
[36:58.400 --> 37:02.880]  I think that the iPad is best seen as part of the PC market. And what, what happened in the
[37:02.880 --> 37:14.480]  early years is that the market was vastly underserved by PCs, portable PCs that are simpler,
[37:16.400 --> 37:22.720]  more portable, and get way better battery life. Like the things that made the iPad, the iPad that
[37:22.720 --> 37:29.120]  it just, it just sucked all the air out of the growth in laptop sales, including, you know, MacBooks
[37:29.120 --> 37:38.880]  for a while. Um, that the iPad style of, of portable computing is just way better for so many use cases
[37:38.880 --> 37:46.240]  than, um, than laptops are. And that it, it had go go growth while it fulfilled that unmet need.
[37:46.240 --> 37:53.760]  And then it just reached the point where, you know, everybody who really wanted one got one and
[37:53.760 --> 37:58.800]  they still work, you know, and that there's no, then the second factor is that iPads continue,
[37:58.800 --> 38:04.000]  you know, two, three, four year old iPads continue to work just great for most people's needs.
[38:04.000 --> 38:09.360]  And so they don't replace them every two years like they do a fun. So that's my, that's my
[38:09.360 --> 38:16.320]  digression on iPad decline or growth decline. Uh, yeah, I think that's right. Um, you know,
[38:16.320 --> 38:22.080]  I'm not sure, you know, this is, this is like an example where it's tempting to use your own
[38:22.080 --> 38:30.880]  personal example, uh, but I don't know. Well, you know, so I still use an iPad one every day to watch
[38:31.600 --> 38:38.880]  video, uh, in my house, but we're about to have to replace it because time Warner Cable is finally
[38:38.880 --> 38:47.680]  ending support for the, uh, their app. IOS five or whatever it runs. So, um, maybe, maybe Apple
[38:48.880 --> 38:54.800]  asked them to do that so that we would buy a new iPad. Um, yeah, my dad has an iPad one still
[38:54.800 --> 38:59.120]  and I wouldn't say he loves it because he's just not in the technology, but he swears he does
[38:59.120 --> 39:04.400]  not want a newer one. It's just fine. It's in perfect shape, but now candy crush doesn't run. Uh-oh.
[39:04.400 --> 39:11.440]  Yeah. It's just like it crashes at a certain point. And I'm sure it's big, you know, I said,
[39:11.440 --> 39:16.320]  I probably, it's just the type of bug that slips in because I'm bet they don't test on the iPad
[39:16.320 --> 39:19.760]  one anymore. And now they're going to get complaints about it and they'll fix it in the next update,
[39:19.760 --> 39:25.760]  but you just have to wait for them to update it. Yeah. Uh, but the iPad one, the iPad one is sort
[39:25.760 --> 39:29.520]  of an exception to because there's a lot of things that have dropped support for iPad one,
[39:29.520 --> 39:35.920]  right? But iPad two is effectively still on the market. It's because it's like the guts of that
[39:35.920 --> 39:43.760]  cheap, uh, uh, other mini non retinamini is effectively an iPad two. Yeah. And half the cash registers
[39:43.760 --> 39:49.920]  at the coffee shops of America. So yeah, like if anything, the opposite problem with iPad two
[39:49.920 --> 39:56.000]  where developers are going to be saddled with supporting that level of, you know, CPU and RAM,
[39:56.000 --> 40:03.120]  uh, it's going to be years. And I, you know, I think the fact that there's, I know a lot of
[40:03.120 --> 40:06.560]  people really complain about the fact that they're still selling that because it's, you know,
[40:06.560 --> 40:15.040]  it's, it's holding back that, that level of, uh, baseline support, you know, where you really
[40:15.040 --> 40:21.120]  only have to support X number of years of iPhones going back. iPad is sort of stretching that a lot
[40:21.120 --> 40:28.000]  further because they're keeping that iPad to level of, of device around. But on the other hand,
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.800]  I think it's a sign that in the real world, millions of people, that's good enough.
[40:31.840 --> 40:36.640]  Totally. And, you know, I think that like the, maybe it just got a little ahead of itself,
[40:36.640 --> 40:42.080]  like people were everyone bought a tablet and then some people bought two or three because they were
[40:42.800 --> 40:47.200]  you know, getting better or coming in at smaller sizes and that kind of stuff. And now,
[40:47.200 --> 40:52.720]  you know, combine that with the probably longer, much longer replacement cycle than a cell phone
[40:53.760 --> 40:58.560]  and the smaller market. Now we're seeing the results of that. And, you know, maybe in a year or two
[40:59.120 --> 41:06.480]  as people, you know, grow tired or, or as their current iPads become less useful. They'll,
[41:06.480 --> 41:13.920]  they'll replace them. I think a lot of it is on Apple, uh, to, and, you know, I don't want to repeat
[41:13.920 --> 41:19.920]  a million people who've talked about this, but is really on Apple now to, to further define what
[41:19.920 --> 41:25.200]  the iPad is for. Uh, and I think that, that they're starting to do that. Um,
[41:25.920 --> 41:31.840]  yeah, I expect it to grow sort of like the way the Mac has, you know, like slowly, but surely,
[41:31.840 --> 41:37.600]  if they can keep, if they can keep it ahead of, you know, the market, which is central. I mean,
[41:37.600 --> 41:43.680]  there's a lot of times when I talk, I make the assumption that Apple's going to
[41:43.680 --> 41:50.160]  continue thriving and, and sometimes critics of, you know, my writing or just, you know, readers who
[41:50.160 --> 41:54.800]  with critics thinking critically will, will point that out and, and assume that it's some kind of
[41:55.600 --> 42:01.840]  bias. Um, or that I think Apple is magic and that they, you know, magically just no matter what
[42:01.840 --> 42:05.280]  they do, they're going to succeed. It's all based on the fundamental assumption that they can
[42:05.280 --> 42:11.040]  keep doing what they've been doing for close to 20 years, which is making superior products,
[42:11.040 --> 42:15.840]  whether everybody agrees that they're superior or not, you know, some number of people have seen
[42:15.840 --> 42:20.720]  their devices as superior and significant ways. And assuming they can keep doing that,
[42:20.720 --> 42:24.080]  I think they can keep growing, you know, so there's, there is an assumption there,
[42:24.080 --> 42:27.920]  but I think it's going to grow like the Mac where the Mac has done great the last few years,
[42:27.920 --> 42:32.640]  and it's growing in an overall shrinking market, but it's, it's very slow growth compared to the
[42:32.640 --> 42:37.440]  iPhone. Yes. All right. So now I'm going to end this parenthesis and I'm going to say,
[42:37.440 --> 42:42.400]  okay, now you're Tim Cook with a hundred billion dollars. How do you spend it to keep making
[42:43.040 --> 42:49.120]  those products great? And I don't, it's not buying Twitter and Pinterest. I think it's, you know,
[42:50.160 --> 42:53.600]  and I wrote this in my piece today like what, what would be ideals if they could,
[42:54.480 --> 43:00.000]  if they had a year where they could just focus on making iOS and Mac OS and all their software
[43:00.000 --> 43:05.440]  better, that's not feasible, but if they could increase their engineering organization so that
[43:05.440 --> 43:11.840]  there were enough people to A, build a new stuff they wanted to build and B, keep refining the old stuff
[43:13.280 --> 43:17.600]  that that would be a good use of money. Obviously, it's hard to hire engineers and they're
[43:17.600 --> 43:22.720]  having to open up new offices and other places to do that kind of thing, but that's where I'd
[43:22.720 --> 43:27.120]  like to see Apple spend their money. Right. And then there's the whole Mythical Man month
[43:28.960 --> 43:35.040]  factor where you can't, even if you can get more good engineers, you can't solve individual
[43:35.040 --> 43:40.160]  projects, problems just by throwing more engineers at them. True. More engineers would definitely
[43:40.160 --> 43:46.320]  help. I don't think there's a single company in technology today that's not, doesn't feel
[43:46.320 --> 43:54.560]  talent starved. I really don't. I mean, I think it's, I think it's universal Google, Apple, Microsoft,
[43:55.200 --> 44:00.960]  Twitter, any of those companies, Facebook, any of those companies, you know, for everything I've
[44:00.960 --> 44:07.760]  seen is that the recruiting market is more as tenacious or more tenacious than it's ever been.
[44:08.800 --> 44:13.440]  But it's not about throwing more people at the same projects. It's having more people to spread
[44:13.440 --> 44:18.000]  into the size of a team is not going to grow, but it's being able to have more teams.
[44:18.640 --> 44:23.360]  Yeah. Right. So maybe Apple should buy one of those coding schools. There you go.
[44:23.360 --> 44:30.800]  No, I just like, you know, you know, and I've been watching, you know, I've been using Apple
[44:30.800 --> 44:37.280]  products for 25 years now or more. And, you know, nothing was ever perfect, but it does certainly
[44:37.280 --> 44:44.320]  feel now like there are some holes in the products I use every day where, you know, nothing is
[44:44.320 --> 44:50.720]  really, really bad, but it could be better to be stretched a little thing. Yeah, I think. And that
[44:50.720 --> 44:57.280]  they've, you know, and maybe that's a good thing. Maybe in the grand scheme of things, if you can't
[44:57.280 --> 45:02.240]  achieve perfection and you know, and let's just assume, you know, I did human nature that nobody's
[45:02.240 --> 45:08.720]  perfect. It's a little better to air on the side of going too fast than to air on the side of
[45:08.720 --> 45:16.800]  going too slow. Totally, right? That you want to be on that too fast side and not the too slow side.
[45:16.800 --> 45:22.160]  And, you know, I think what we've seen in the last year is that Apple's being a little too
[45:22.160 --> 45:28.240]  fast as there are a little too far away from that optimal line, you know, things like all the
[45:28.240 --> 45:35.040]  continuity features and stuff like that. Most of them work great, but none of them feel quite to me
[45:35.840 --> 45:42.640]  like perfect. Like one thing that has definitely changed my daily computing is because I'm
[45:42.640 --> 45:48.720]  especially between phone and Mac in, you know, in the house is I'll go downstairs and get more
[45:48.720 --> 45:53.840]  coffee and I'll take my phone out and I'll see something. And now, oh, I want to link that
[45:53.840 --> 45:59.280]  I'm doing fireball and I used to do something like send it to pin board and come up to my Mac
[45:59.280 --> 46:04.720]  and load pin board and do that. Now I use air drop. I air drop to myself every day, multiple times.
[46:04.720 --> 46:11.440]  And usually it's perfect. You just say share their, my other device shows up on air drop and I tap
[46:11.440 --> 46:17.440]  it in a second or two later, it's there. And then I don't have like an extra bookmark in pin board
[46:17.440 --> 46:22.880]  that I really didn't want there permanently to do something with, you know, there's no, you know,
[46:22.880 --> 46:27.920]  I don't know what you would call it, digital detritus left over. It's great. But then there's
[46:27.920 --> 46:32.480]  sometimes where I'm right there next to my Mac with my phone and I go to air drop and my Mac just
[46:32.480 --> 46:36.720]  doesn't show up. And I haven't turned Bluetooth off or anything like that just doesn't show up.
[46:36.720 --> 46:43.920]  And this is my experience as well. And it's most frustrating because I don't know why it's not
[46:43.920 --> 46:51.760]  working. And then it seems like I'm not in my own contacts file or something like that. So I have
[46:51.760 --> 46:58.720]  to change the air drop settings to share with everyone and not just contacts. But it should know
[46:58.720 --> 47:04.400]  I'm me because I'm the same. I don't know how it knows I'm me or not. Maybe I've seen some
[47:04.400 --> 47:07.840]  people write that it really doesn't work well for them at all. For me, I would say it works
[47:07.840 --> 47:15.040]  at least 95% of the time. Maybe I'm like in the 25% range. And maybe I just need to
[47:15.680 --> 47:19.760]  let loose with the permissions and let it share with everyone. But even just trying to
[47:19.760 --> 47:25.520]  sync with my own Mac or with, you know, my wife's iPhone where we're definitely in each other's
[47:25.520 --> 47:33.840]  contact files, it still never wants to find them when we want to use it. Another example, I mean,
[47:33.840 --> 47:37.280]  it's not a new 2014 thing. It's actually a little bit older. But I mean, don't even get me
[47:37.280 --> 47:46.000]  started on my experience with iTunes match, which is just I don't know. So my wife had it turned on
[47:46.000 --> 47:52.560]  too. And it's like we got our new iPhones a couple months ago. And it's like she was just
[47:52.560 --> 47:56.960]  pissed. She came back from the gym the one day. And she at one point, she had the new phone and
[47:56.960 --> 48:00.960]  she had all of her music. And it was on the phone because it was a sort of thing with a new
[48:00.960 --> 48:04.560]  phone that she would have checked before she went to the gym the first time to listen to music.
[48:04.560 --> 48:08.560]  She had it. She listened to music. And then like the next day, she got to the gym and her phone
[48:08.560 --> 48:14.880]  had no songs. Zero. Just no songs. They're just gone. That's, yeah. Well, I just did something
[48:15.440 --> 48:22.800]  immensely stupid, which was I put a new hard drive in my iMac and tried to start from scratch.
[48:22.800 --> 48:28.320]  But my iTunes, of course, through iTunes match already had all the metadata for all my
[48:28.320 --> 48:32.240]  songs in it. So instead of trying to download them all from Apple servers,
[48:32.880 --> 48:39.600]  I dropped the music folder on top of the iTunes icon in the dock to, you know,
[48:40.800 --> 48:49.200]  theoretically re-associate all those song files with the app. And then it duplicated everything
[48:49.200 --> 48:53.920]  in the listings. And I'm like, oh shit. Now I have two copies of every song. I'm going to have to
[48:53.920 --> 48:59.920]  figure out how to go through and un-duplicate it. And I tweeted something to that extent. And
[48:59.920 --> 49:03.840]  people are like, oh, don't mean, you know, that kind of stuff. And then, you know, it's so funny.
[49:03.840 --> 49:09.440]  I came back the next day and it had totally fixed itself. Like, the nothing was duplicated.
[49:09.440 --> 49:12.880]  So I have no idea how that worked. But it actually worked.
[49:13.920 --> 49:20.240]  Some of these features are supposed to be like air drop. I don't even know quite how it works.
[49:20.240 --> 49:25.120]  I know it's some combination of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and, you know, those like invisible Wi-Fi
[49:25.120 --> 49:31.200]  networks that don't show up as Wi-Fi networks. But it's encapsulating a lot of complexity to make
[49:31.200 --> 49:36.240]  all the handshaking. And then it presents itself in a very simple interface. But it's got to be bullet
[49:36.240 --> 49:40.800]  proof. It's got to be that if I'm, if this device A and device B are clearly within range of each
[49:40.800 --> 49:46.080]  other and they're both on, it should be, you know, it should be every bit as consistent as when
[49:46.080 --> 49:52.400]  you open the finder and you go to your home folder that your home folder has all of your stuff in
[49:52.400 --> 49:58.000]  it. Right? Every time you go to the finder and you go to your home folder, you know, the connection
[49:58.000 --> 50:05.840]  between OS 10 and the files on your hard drive is it's 100% consistent. You know, like, air drop
[50:05.840 --> 50:10.480]  has got to get that good. Right. It should feel like magic. And that's, you know, and that's
[50:10.480 --> 50:16.800]  where I'd rather see Apple invest in, you know, in kind of perfecting that. And I'm sure it's
[50:16.800 --> 50:22.880]  tricky. You know, Bluetooth for years seemed like it was just a joke of a technology. And it
[50:22.880 --> 50:28.000]  seems to have gotten better and more recently than it's definitely definitely gotten better at
[50:28.000 --> 50:33.920]  battery life. The tooth low energy is aptly named. It's, you know, because I used to never
[50:33.920 --> 50:39.280]  keep Bluetooth on it. I, I, I turned it off. I, the only thing I really could have used it for,
[50:39.280 --> 50:45.200]  while we have speakers that, that are Bluetooth, but it, I didn't use them. And then my car,
[50:45.200 --> 50:48.960]  you can connect it to the car, so you can get your cars through the, your calls through the thing.
[50:48.960 --> 50:52.800]  But it was such a hassle to remember to turn Bluetooth off before I got in the car that I never
[50:52.800 --> 50:57.680]  did. And if I left it on, which I always would, if I did remember to turn it on, I would forget
[50:57.680 --> 51:01.680]  to turn it off when I got out of the car. And I'd be like, geez, I didn't even use my phone for a while.
[51:01.680 --> 51:04.720]  Why did the battery life drop? And it's because I had Bluetooth on, but it doesn't, you know,
[51:04.720 --> 51:08.320]  now it just seems like you can leave Bluetooth on your phone and it's, you know, it's good.
[51:08.320 --> 51:12.960]  I would say the biggest thing that Apple could do with the amount of cash that they have
[51:13.760 --> 51:20.480]  is focus it on ways that give them competitive edges that can't be matched
[51:22.240 --> 51:30.640]  by anyone else or by as few other companies as possible. Because I think that's the key to their
[51:30.640 --> 51:39.040]  success, you know, for 20 years is that they've had design chops that couldn't be matched. And
[51:39.040 --> 51:44.880]  arguably still aren't. Right. But focus on more and more of those things. I think that the whole
[51:44.880 --> 51:51.600]  sapphire debacle in Arizona wasn't attempted that. Yes. And they botched it. I think, you know,
[51:51.600 --> 51:58.160]  the idea was that they were going to work out of deal with what was that company?
[51:58.160 --> 52:03.680]  I don't remember, but yeah, well, you know, they worked out a deal where they were going to,
[52:04.960 --> 52:09.440]  you know, supply the capital to create an unheard of number of sapphire furnaces.
[52:10.320 --> 52:14.560]  And they would have the right to buy as, you know, the, you know, all of the sapphire that the
[52:14.560 --> 52:20.800]  facility produced, which if it had worked, or if they can somehow salvage this and it does eventually
[52:20.800 --> 52:26.560]  work, they'll have something that nobody else will have. Nobody, you know, Samsung won't be able to
[52:26.560 --> 52:33.200]  make a phone, you know, in, in, in quantity with the sapphire display because there won't be anywhere
[52:33.200 --> 52:37.040]  in the world to buy them. I think it's a perfect example of the sort of thing that Apple should be
[52:37.040 --> 52:40.880]  doing with its money. Yeah. And it's something that Apple can do now that it couldn't do
[52:41.520 --> 52:49.760]  in the old days before they had this giant massive sum of cash, you know, in 2002, 2003, Apple didn't
[52:49.760 --> 52:54.800]  have the ability to spend 10 or 20 billion dollars on X because they didn't have 10 or 20 billion
[52:54.800 --> 53:00.640]  dollars sitting in a bank account. Right. And instead they, they famously like negotiated just crazy
[53:00.640 --> 53:06.960]  great terms on, you know, on deals with suppliers and buying out all the flash or whatever.
[53:06.960 --> 53:14.320]  Right. But how they're in a position to bankroll the creation of an entire new basically industry.
[53:14.320 --> 53:19.680]  I mean, this, by the way, the company is called GT Advanced Technologies. Yeah. And the
[53:19.680 --> 53:27.600]  stat that I found crazy is that Apple already is using one fourth of the entire world supply of
[53:27.600 --> 53:33.680]  sapphire just for the iPhone camera lens and fingerprint reader. And that was the Wall Street Journal.
[53:33.680 --> 53:38.960]  So, you know, they've already promised that the top two tiers of Apple watch are going to
[53:38.960 --> 53:44.640]  have sapphire covered displays. Right. So that's a crazy, you know, amount of, of the market that
[53:44.640 --> 53:50.720]  they already control for these two tiny components, granted, on hundreds of millions of products.
[53:50.720 --> 53:56.400]  But, but you can imagine now take those hundreds of millions of iPhones and multiply the sapphire
[53:56.400 --> 54:02.720]  by whatever 20 or something like that. And you literally are creating an entire new market.
[54:02.720 --> 54:06.160]  And that's what you can do with when you have a hundred billion dollars.
[54:07.360 --> 54:12.160]  Secondary digression is on the sapphire thing. I'm one of the things I've been thinking about lately
[54:12.160 --> 54:16.960]  is one of the things that's come out of the court filings with the bankruptcy of GT Advanced
[54:16.960 --> 54:23.520]  Technology is that we now know what we suspected all along, but we know for sure now that at some point,
[54:23.520 --> 54:29.520]  Apple had hoped to use sapphire in this year's new iPhones for the displays, not just for the
[54:29.520 --> 54:35.280]  the camera back. That if everything had gone perfectly or at least according to plan or something,
[54:35.280 --> 54:40.160]  some measure like that, Apple, you know, the iPhone 6 and 6 plus would have sapphire displays.
[54:40.160 --> 54:49.520]  And they don't. Which makes me wonder how much, whether they're there now, the fact that GT
[54:49.520 --> 54:56.480]  Advanced failed, whether they're in trouble now with the sapphire displays for the watches.
[54:56.480 --> 55:01.680]  Ah, and not that they would have to change it, because they've already promised that they're
[55:01.680 --> 55:08.400]  coming out. I would be shocked if they switched to glass for the addition in the stainless.
[55:08.400 --> 55:16.320]  But I'm wondering if we might not see one of those Apple launches where, you know, midnight,
[55:16.320 --> 55:22.480]  everybody's madly clicking and, you know, by like 12, 15 Eastern, or I guess they go on
[55:22.480 --> 55:27.920]  sale Pacific, I don't know. But, you know, 15 minutes after the pre-orders go online, people are
[55:27.920 --> 55:33.280]  already seeing quotes of four to six weeks. And, you know, the next day, you're already seeing,
[55:33.280 --> 55:36.640]  you know, six, seven weeks, you know, estimated delivery.
[55:36.640 --> 55:42.320]  Oh, you're not necessarily because it's so many people buying them, but because it's the sapphire.
[55:42.320 --> 55:49.040]  If they were banking on GT advanced technology, the sapphire might be a significant constraint.
[55:49.040 --> 55:56.800]  Just, both people. Yeah, in supply and maybe even in price. So, although at this point,
[55:56.800 --> 56:02.320]  they'd probably eat the money and make the watches. I have no idea. Yeah, but I'm not Tim,
[56:02.320 --> 56:06.960]  I'm not Tim Cook. So, yeah, exactly. I think that this, this is the sort of thing that Tim Cook
[56:06.960 --> 56:11.600]  is, you know, the best in the world that so far. But the other thing that I thought that I'm
[56:11.600 --> 56:17.200]  probably wrong about that, that the sapphire will be a significant gating issue on production is
[56:17.200 --> 56:22.880]  that they're going to need a lot less sapphire for Apple Watch than they would have for the phones.
[56:22.880 --> 56:26.720]  Because the phones are, you know, how many did they sell in the holiday quarter? How many did
[56:26.720 --> 56:30.880]  they expect to sell this holiday quarter? I don't know, but I'm going to make up a number and say
[56:30.880 --> 56:37.360]  50 million. Yeah, and figure maybe 30 to 40 million of those are iPhone sixes. Right. So,
[56:37.360 --> 56:43.120]  something could be. Yeah, it's to say at least 30 million iPhone sixes, which are bigger. And in the
[56:43.120 --> 56:48.880]  case of the six plus a lot bigger than the watch, whereas the watch, you know, nobody knows how
[56:48.880 --> 56:53.200]  many they're going to sell, but especially in the more expensive stainless in addition levels.
[56:53.200 --> 56:59.120]  Right. It's not 30 million in a quarter. And it's not a five inch display.
[56:59.120 --> 57:04.880]  And we're not going to be told how many they've sold. No, which is true. Yeah.
[57:06.240 --> 57:10.560]  So, yeah, that's a great example. Another one at which they did do is test flight. I mean,
[57:10.560 --> 57:15.200]  I think that's, that's, that's a, that's the sort of thing that they, that they actually probably
[57:15.200 --> 57:20.720]  know they should have done sooner. And, and probably we're just being snobby about it. You know,
[57:20.720 --> 57:24.640]  why, why are all these developers using test flight when they should be using our built-in
[57:24.640 --> 57:30.960]  drag and drop email attachment app testing system? So, you know, anytime you see a bunch of,
[57:31.600 --> 57:37.360]  of app developers jumping onto a third party tool like that, like just pick it up. I mean,
[57:37.360 --> 57:44.560]  yeah, you know, they've certainly tried to build a few of them like a cloud kit, which I haven't
[57:44.560 --> 57:51.360]  used is very similar to parse, which I do use, which Facebook owns, you know, that's the kind of
[57:51.360 --> 57:55.840]  thing that that, you know, they should just keep an eye out for that kind of stuff. And none of
[57:55.840 --> 58:00.880]  those are billion dollar deals. Those are all much, much smaller. I think manufacturing in general
[58:00.880 --> 58:07.120]  is a big deal. And I can't help but wonder if this is another purely hypothetical, but
[58:09.120 --> 58:15.680]  we know that they're building like the Mac Pros in the US or assembling them. And if they have
[58:15.680 --> 58:22.880]  grand plans to shift more and more of their assembly to the United States, which if they do,
[58:24.160 --> 58:31.280]  I, my guess would be that it would be more along the lines of robotitizing the assembly line.
[58:31.280 --> 58:34.960]  Because if you ever look like this, you know, it's surprise, it was surprising to me like when we
[58:34.960 --> 58:39.680]  first started getting behind the scene looks at Foxconn and how phones are assembled in iPads
[58:39.680 --> 58:46.080]  are assembled and how much of it is just done by hand by just people at a bench, you know, putting,
[58:46.080 --> 58:50.400]  you know, putting these pieces together. I think if they brought that to the United States
[58:51.120 --> 58:56.160]  to make it cost effective, it would probably not be like a bonanza of manufacturing jobs.
[58:56.160 --> 59:01.280]  It would probably be about figuring out a way to robotitize the assembly and then they could
[59:01.280 --> 59:07.760]  bring it internally. And they'd have these roboticized assembly lines that no one else in the world
[59:07.760 --> 59:14.240]  would have, right? Like Foxconn gains the ability to do X, then anybody who uses Foxconn gets the
[59:14.240 --> 59:20.880]  ability to do X. And Foxconn itself, too, exactly, which little surprise they have not been more
[59:20.880 --> 59:27.920]  competitive already. Right. And for example, just look at the, the Nokia tablet that the looks is
[59:27.920 --> 59:32.960]  like a iPad mini lookalike and it's every, you know, drilled aluminum, all this stuff.
[59:32.960 --> 59:39.120]  It's really like a relabeled Foxconn product. It's a Foxconn tablet that Nokia is putting their
[59:39.120 --> 59:43.840]  name on. Where do you think Foxconn learns to make a tablet that looks like that? Well, they learned
[59:43.840 --> 59:49.120]  it from Apple. You know, I don't think it's, you know, I don't think it's any coincidence that
[59:49.120 --> 59:55.040]  Samsung, which makes a, you know, a lot of components and until recently made all that CPUs for
[59:55.040 --> 1:00:01.440]  the iPhone and iPad, you know, got better at making cell phones after they, you know, worked with
[1:00:01.440 --> 1:00:06.560]  Apple on that. Um, so I wouldn't be surprised to see that, that to me would be an interesting way
[1:00:06.560 --> 1:00:11.600]  for Apple to spend money. And I think GT, the GT advanced deal was a sign of that. I think it's not
[1:00:11.600 --> 1:00:16.800]  just about materials, but maybe assembly in general, but maybe for some reason, you know, like,
[1:00:16.800 --> 1:00:21.440]  why did, why did they do the whole thing with GT advanced instead of Apple just making their,
[1:00:21.440 --> 1:00:25.760]  making an owning their own Sapphire furnace? I don't know. For some reason, they seem resistant to
[1:00:25.760 --> 1:00:31.920]  they want to decrease the risk, you know, and then if you look at the, the court filings on the
[1:00:31.920 --> 1:00:39.680]  terms like boy, did they ever decrease the risk? Like it's crazy how basically Apple has complete
[1:00:40.240 --> 1:00:48.240]  control over everything and, you know, GT basically can't do anything. Right. And GT's like court
[1:00:48.240 --> 1:00:52.320]  filing was kind of pathetic because they were like, they, they made us this offer that was
[1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:56.320]  horribly unbalanced. And everybody's like, wow, Apple's really mean, you know, they even,
[1:00:56.320 --> 1:01:00.480]  there was even a phrase where they, you know, quoted a guy that in a phone call, a guy from Apple
[1:01:00.480 --> 1:01:08.000]  told them to put your big boy pants off. Yeah. It was very dismissive. Really, but my take on that
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:12.720]  is, it wasn't like GT advanced had to say yes to this, they agreed to all of it. Right. It's,
[1:01:12.720 --> 1:01:17.600]  it's sort of like, unsaid in their filings is, well, of course we said yes, because if it worked
[1:01:17.600 --> 1:01:22.000]  out, look at how much money we would have made. Totally. Right. Yeah. Meanwhile, there's a
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:28.480]  $50 million NDA penalty. Yeah. That was an interesting thing that came out of it. Yeah, 50
[1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:33.600]  men. And it was, and it got worse like for subsequent ones. Yeah, that's great. One thing I've noticed,
[1:01:33.600 --> 1:01:39.360]  and if you look at the list of suppliers and stuff that we know about Apple watch,
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:47.600]  it's a, it's a different list than that makes iPhone and iPad. Just like the component makers,
[1:01:47.600 --> 1:01:51.280]  it's coming from a lot of different companies. And I can't help but think that's because Apple is
[1:01:51.280 --> 1:01:56.960]  dissatisfied with their manufacturing partners for those things because of all the rampant leaks.
[1:01:56.960 --> 1:02:01.840]  And could be, yeah. Yeah. And the way that, you know, competing products seem to be piggybacking
[1:02:01.840 --> 1:02:06.240]  on their innovations. So I think that the one thing they could do with their resources now is
[1:02:07.920 --> 1:02:15.360]  try to make those, try to make those things, you know, something that they own. I think, you know,
[1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:22.240]  an interesting example of that already, I would say are the, the A series systems on a chip,
[1:02:23.280 --> 1:02:32.560]  which it's like they've turned the whole, we use different CPUs than the standard components
[1:02:32.560 --> 1:02:37.520]  that everybody else does thing on its head. In the old days, when Apple was on the Motorola 68,000
[1:02:37.520 --> 1:02:45.040]  chips and later power PC chips and the wind tell industry was on X86, Apple was selling
[1:02:45.040 --> 1:02:50.640]  in lesser quantities. And they could never, the quantities were never enough to keep up, right?
[1:02:50.640 --> 1:02:56.960]  There's no way for Motorola and IBM and the partners that were making power PC chips to really sustain
[1:02:57.600 --> 1:03:03.920]  the, the advances that were necessary to keep up with Intel because the numbers just weren't there.
[1:03:03.920 --> 1:03:08.080]  And Apple couldn't have, you know, had no resources to do it on their own. Whereas now,
[1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:14.160]  by making, you know, these wildly popular, massively selling devices that are using these chips,
[1:03:14.160 --> 1:03:20.160]  they're, they're getting the economy of scale advantages with their A5 series, you know,
[1:03:20.160 --> 1:03:27.200]  A6, A7, A8. And by all accounts, you know, like at a non-tech in those places, faster and far
[1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:32.400]  more power efficient chips than the Snapdragon's that everybody else is using. And they, you know,
[1:03:32.400 --> 1:03:37.520]  they're not sharing. Nobody else gets to make a phone with these amazing systems on a chip.
[1:03:38.720 --> 1:03:43.840]  How can they do more things like that? Yeah. And, and, and so there's a hardware element to that,
[1:03:43.840 --> 1:03:49.920]  and then there's a software element. And, and I think a lot of people, and a service is element too.
[1:03:49.920 --> 1:03:55.600]  I mean, what can, you know, I, I keep coming back to iCloud and I'm trying to think like bigger
[1:03:55.600 --> 1:04:01.600]  picture is, is iCloud a success so far. And there's, you know, there's a lot of griping about
[1:04:01.600 --> 1:04:06.640]  little things here and there. I think it is sort of a success. I mean, you know, it backs up my
[1:04:06.640 --> 1:04:11.440]  phone every night and I don't even think about it. And it seems like they, they're, they're
[1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:16.560]  trying to do more with it. But that's the kind of thing where, you know, that could, that could
[1:04:16.560 --> 1:04:25.200]  easily be a huge advantage over, over everyone else. Like, you know, just back people stuff up,
[1:04:25.200 --> 1:04:31.200]  you know, make sharing super easy. That's going to be hard to be a, it should be. It should get better.
[1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:34.640]  And they should key. I think it is, I think it's quietly getting a lot better. I think that
[1:04:34.640 --> 1:04:39.520]  they're nibbling at the problems around the edges. But it's never going to be a sustaining advantage.
[1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:43.920]  It has a lock in advantage where once you're there and your backups are already there,
[1:04:43.920 --> 1:04:48.560]  it's a lot easier to just buy an iPhone and have your backup restore to the new iPhone than it is
[1:04:48.560 --> 1:04:54.080]  to switch to Android. But it's not really that big of a competitive advantage because Google stuff
[1:04:54.080 --> 1:05:00.080]  is so good at those things. You know, that that you're, yeah, Google like, yeah, Gmail and Google
[1:05:00.080 --> 1:05:05.200]  calendar and Google hangouts are really good. But I don't know if Google Drive is really catching
[1:05:05.200 --> 1:05:12.240]  on or anything like that. So I don't know. Anyway, all right, I think that their Apple is a better
[1:05:12.240 --> 1:05:18.320]  chance. I think that cloud stuff in general, the best that they can hope for is to be as good as
[1:05:18.320 --> 1:05:22.160]  the state of the art. Right. And I think a lot of the, actually a lot of people saying that they
[1:05:22.160 --> 1:05:27.120]  should buy all these companies are saying, oh, they'll learn how to be better at the cloud if they
[1:05:27.120 --> 1:05:33.600]  own Twitter or Pinterest or something like that. And I mean, there was probably a point where I
[1:05:33.600 --> 1:05:38.800]  used to think that I don't think that would help right now. No, I don't think that the problem is
[1:05:38.800 --> 1:05:45.040]  fundamental, just generic cloud. I think the problem is just specific problems. Yeah. And Pinterest,
[1:05:45.040 --> 1:05:48.080]  the him saying that they should buy Pinterest. I mean, Pinterest is a good company and they're doing
[1:05:48.080 --> 1:05:54.320]  interesting things. But it's, it doesn't make any again, it's the same thing with Twitter. I just
[1:05:54.320 --> 1:06:00.560]  don't see how that gives Apple any advantage in what they do. You know, it's, but if they think that,
[1:06:00.560 --> 1:06:05.920]  you know, Pinterest is a good investment today, it would, it would be make far more sense for like,
[1:06:05.920 --> 1:06:11.360]  what's that? Braburn Capital, you know, the secretive Nevada company that, that controls Apple's
[1:06:13.360 --> 1:06:19.200]  investments, you know, some of this stuff they do do, you know, with the cash, you know, it would
[1:06:19.200 --> 1:06:24.960]  make sense for Braburn to just buy stock in Pinterest and just, you know, think, you know, they'll
[1:06:24.960 --> 1:06:32.160]  make money on it, but rather than have Apple buy them and control them. Yeah. Well, next time,
[1:06:32.960 --> 1:06:38.560]  next time you talk to MG, ask him if, if he were running Apple Ventures instead of working at
[1:06:38.560 --> 1:06:46.640]  Google Ventures, what he'd be doing with that 100 bill. Yeah. Let me take a break here and thank
[1:06:46.640 --> 1:06:53.440]  our second sponsor of the show are very good friends at Squarespace. You guys know what Squarespace

[1:07:26.080 --> 1:07:32.400]  you, you know, have on each page, it's all drag and drop right there on this side itself.
[1:07:32.400 --> 1:07:37.200]  It couldn't be easier. It's the way like when people said the web, you know, the problem with the
[1:07:37.200 --> 1:07:43.600]  web originally has conceived back in the 90s was that it wasn't editable in itself. That's like
[1:07:43.600 --> 1:07:48.800]  with Squarespace. Squarespace is like the editable web where you're just there and if you're the,
[1:07:48.800 --> 1:07:54.880]  you know, if it's your site, you just edit anything you want right there in place. Super, super easy.
[1:07:56.240 --> 1:08:02.240]  No technical knowledge whatsoever is necessary. But if you do have technical knowledge and I know
[1:08:02.240 --> 1:08:06.000]  a lot of people listen to this show too, you can get into the code and you can put your own
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:10.400]  JavaScript and pages. You can change, you know, the HTML and templates and stuff like that.

[1:08:25.040 --> 1:08:32.320]  and Portland, Oregon. And it starts at just eight bucks a month, eight bucks a month.
[1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:37.360]  Incredibly, I don't even know how they, I don't know how they can do it all for this for eight
[1:08:37.360 --> 1:08:42.000]  bucks a month. When you pay for the year, if you pay for a whole year in advance, you get a free
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:48.720]  domain name. All their templates feature responsive design. Everything scales to look great on iPhone
[1:08:48.720 --> 1:08:56.240]  five, iPhone six plus iPad, Android tablets, anything you name it, the designs look great, scaled
[1:08:56.240 --> 1:09:01.360]  to the right size. So if you have any reason to start a website, you're thinking you need a website

[1:09:32.560 --> 1:09:37.840]  thanks to Squarespace. All right. What else do you want to talk about today? Oh, well, something I want
[1:09:37.840 --> 1:09:43.840]  to talk to you about for a while. And that's the idea of institutional taste. And I think this
[1:09:43.840 --> 1:09:51.120]  might be a Gruber term. I'm not sure. But I've been thinking about it. And you know, as I've been
[1:09:51.120 --> 1:09:57.280]  kind of taking a look at companies this year and writing about them at courts. And I'm curious,
[1:09:57.280 --> 1:10:03.360]  like, you know, about a bunch of things. But I guess first, like, how do you define institutional
[1:10:03.360 --> 1:10:12.880]  taste? I would say it's almost like a cultural value, like a shared cultural value that you see
[1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:20.000]  things the same way and you value things the same way. One of the points, like a recurring theme
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:27.520]  in my work in recent years is the idea that the it's not just what your priorities are. Your top
[1:10:27.520 --> 1:10:32.400]  three priorities, but it matters what order of those top three priorities are in. It matters
[1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:42.640]  which one you can say that you value, you know, good, you know, just pick, you know, material,
[1:10:42.640 --> 1:10:50.240]  the materials you use, the shape and the weight, or like with Apple, like like they value
[1:10:50.240 --> 1:10:56.720]  thinness, they value weight, they value battery life, they value elegance, they value how it feels.
[1:10:58.560 --> 1:11:06.480]  But it's clear that Apple institutionally values thinness and weight more than they value battery
[1:11:06.480 --> 1:11:16.880]  life. Because otherwise they, you know, there's my old iPhone four right here by my desk,
[1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:22.000]  which is, you know, I think when it came out was billed as being the world's thinnest phone. And if
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:28.640]  it wasn't, it was pretty darn close. And it's just a couple years ago. So in, you know, if they
[1:11:28.640 --> 1:11:34.160]  value battery more than thinnest, I think that today's iPhone sixes would be maybe not as thick
[1:11:34.160 --> 1:11:38.080]  as the iPhone four, but they'd be thicker than they are. And they would have used that thickness
[1:11:38.080 --> 1:11:44.880]  to put more battery in there. It just matters what, you know, which order those priorities are,
[1:11:44.880 --> 1:11:48.880]  not that they don't care about battery life, but they obviously value thinness and weight above
[1:11:48.880 --> 1:11:54.880]  that. I think institutional taste, that's just a sign of it. And it propagates that it's people
[1:11:54.880 --> 1:12:01.200]  who share those values in that taste that are drawn to work at the company. And the company recruits
[1:12:01.200 --> 1:12:09.680]  people who share those values. And then it, you know, it sustains itself, I think, it tends to.
[1:12:11.040 --> 1:12:16.560]  And, you know, and obviously like this is something Apple excels at, you know, whether we can
[1:12:16.560 --> 1:12:22.400]  really define it or not a really, you know, kind of explain everything that it applies to.
[1:12:23.760 --> 1:12:28.560]  This is kind of a pro Apple argument to be made. Are there other companies you see that
[1:12:28.560 --> 1:12:33.120]  that you think have good institutional taste? I know we can name a bunch that have bad, you know,
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:39.040]  historically, have had bad taste. Are there others that that you think have good taste?
[1:12:39.920 --> 1:12:48.400]  I think Google clearly does. And I think that's why they have as rabid of fans as Apple does,
[1:12:48.400 --> 1:12:53.040]  but that they tend to be different people. You know, most people who truly say they love Google
[1:12:53.040 --> 1:12:58.960]  either are ambivalent about Apple or they have mixed feelings about Apple. Probably mixed feelings
[1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:02.800]  is more common where they probably do use a MacBook. A lot of them use MacBooks, but that they
[1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:12.880]  feel more affinity for Google. But Google's good taste is in things like simplicity and minimalism.
[1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:20.480]  I mean, I think the fact that if you just go to Google.com and what you see on that page here
[1:13:20.480 --> 1:13:30.720]  in 2014 is so close to what you saw back in, you know, 2002 or whenever, you know, when Google was
[1:13:30.720 --> 1:13:38.160]  a beta at Stanford, where it's just a box and two buttons. And, you know, I mean, look at how much
[1:13:38.160 --> 1:13:43.040]  minimal crap they've added there. And for all, you know, that we complain about Google and
[1:13:43.040 --> 1:13:47.680]  they're advertising that they do, that they've still resisted the urge to really put advertising
[1:13:47.680 --> 1:13:53.120]  on that homepage that they still only show it on results. Imagine what they get charged for just one
[1:13:53.120 --> 1:13:58.640]  ad, you know, something like the deck, you know, just one thing up in the corner on that page.
[1:13:58.640 --> 1:14:04.080]  Imagine what they get charged and they don't. And it's, you know, I think it's a sign of Google's taste.
[1:14:05.680 --> 1:14:10.960]  Do you think so? And I'll just throw this out there. I think that historically a company with
[1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:19.200]  bad taste has been Microsoft, you know, which shows in everything from their kind of visual design
[1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:25.920]  to, you know, the awkwardness of their stage presentations to product decisions and all that kind
[1:14:25.920 --> 1:14:35.840]  of stuff. But I've actually been surprisingly, I guess, surprised at how even like their final
[1:14:35.840 --> 1:14:40.160]  even little things like their file format, like old versions, like when you read how when somebody's
[1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:47.280]  backward engineered an old version of, you know, the word dot doc file. Yeah, it's so con, it's just
[1:14:47.280 --> 1:14:52.480]  horrible. It's just, it, nobody would design a file format like that. And if they had taste.
[1:14:52.480 --> 1:14:58.240]  Yeah, I don't know if it was satire, but like the Microsoft Bob logo is pretty much like
[1:14:58.240 --> 1:15:04.720]  emblematic of, of Microsoft. It seems like it's getting a little better. I don't know. Maybe,
[1:15:04.720 --> 1:15:12.160]  you know, they're making some smart decisions now. Can this taste be taught or changed or
[1:15:12.880 --> 1:15:18.160]  is it, you know, in any sort of timeframe that would matter or is it the kind of thing that's
[1:15:18.720 --> 1:15:25.360]  kind of too deeply ingrained in a company that to change? I think you have to go through some sort
[1:15:25.360 --> 1:15:30.640]  of stressful transition to change. And I think that's what we're seeing with Microsoft. I think,
[1:15:30.640 --> 1:15:35.200]  you know, and, and it's even bubbled up to the point where, you know, not that the
[1:15:35.920 --> 1:15:40.800]  bomb, I don't think he got forced out, but it's pretty close. It's about as close as you can get to
[1:15:40.800 --> 1:15:50.000]  forcing out a CEO of a wildly profitable major corporation, right? I mean, and they're without any sort
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:55.680]  of, um, impropriety or anything like that. Nobody accused, you know, bomber of, of any kind of,
[1:15:55.680 --> 1:16:02.400]  you know, fiscal impropriety or crimes or anything like the sort. It was really, I'm honestly,
[1:16:02.400 --> 1:16:07.440]  I think it really eventually his lack of taste caught up with him in the market had moved on,
[1:16:07.440 --> 1:16:12.640]  right? And so I think Microsoft is going through that sort of transition. And we definitely see it,
[1:16:12.640 --> 1:16:18.320]  I think. I mean, it's Windows, you know, the new version of Windows, you know, the stuff you see on
[1:16:18.320 --> 1:16:28.880]  the surface is, you know, it's absolutely positively not a copy of iOS, and it's good. I don't
[1:16:28.880 --> 1:16:32.320]  think I would prefer it. I really don't. It's been a long time. It's been a couple of years since
[1:16:32.320 --> 1:16:37.920]  I tried living with Windows phone, but, uh, I don't think it's to my liking, but it certainly is
[1:16:37.920 --> 1:16:44.560]  certain. And it's in wherever it ranks in the world of of OS design right now, it certainly shows
[1:16:44.560 --> 1:16:49.360]  a taste that Microsoft never had in the old days. Yeah. And, and, and at the same time, we've
[1:16:49.360 --> 1:16:54.800]  gone from a company that used to say, you know, oh, why would anyone, uh, buy their kids an iPod
[1:16:54.800 --> 1:17:00.320]  to, hey, we've got office for iPad and why would anyone buy their kids an iPod or whatever.
[1:17:00.320 --> 1:17:07.120]  Right. Um, to now there's office for iPad and they're ever integrating Dropbox into PowerPoint and
[1:17:07.120 --> 1:17:14.400]  all, you know, this kind of stuff. And, uh, it seems really, I don't know, maybe it's, uh, maybe
[1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:21.360]  it's too short of a timeframe, but I do, I'm, uh, I'm a little excited about what I see there.
[1:17:21.360 --> 1:17:26.240]  I would go so far as the tie tie it together with the first half of the show and say that it's
[1:17:26.240 --> 1:17:31.840]  actually not even so much about taste, but that Microsoft is institutionally backing away from the
[1:17:31.840 --> 1:17:37.520]  view that they can do it all themselves and that they should do it all themselves. Like the, the
[1:17:37.520 --> 1:17:44.640]  Microsoft edits peak of industry dominance did everything other than the hardware and they, you know,
[1:17:44.640 --> 1:17:50.640]  and they really kind of defined PC hardware, you know, in a way that they, without making any piece,
[1:17:50.640 --> 1:17:55.920]  without it making any PCs themselves, they had enormous influence on it. But they literally did
[1:17:55.920 --> 1:18:02.080]  everything. They wrote their own operating system. Uh, they wrote all of the major apps for that
[1:18:02.080 --> 1:18:08.800]  operating system. Uh, they had their own developer tools. They had their own, eventually, you know,
[1:18:08.800 --> 1:18:14.800]  I would see sharp their own developer and visual basic their own languages. Uh, they went their
[1:18:14.800 --> 1:18:21.280]  own way in a route that it was just unprecedented, you know, uh, and that nobody else has ever really
[1:18:21.280 --> 1:18:26.080]  tried to do again. And, and this is where I tie it with the first half of the show is to me,
[1:18:26.080 --> 1:18:33.200]  the warning sign for Apple, like the biggest canary in the coal mine as we, you know, how is Apple
[1:18:33.200 --> 1:18:37.360]  ever, you know, going to, you know, what am I looking for to see if Apple is maybe starting to lose
[1:18:37.360 --> 1:18:43.600]  their edge? Our signs of hubris, right? I think that's the word that Microsoft had and that that's
[1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:48.480]  the today's Microsoft doesn't have that anymore. Like, and all, like all those things you just listed,
[1:18:48.480 --> 1:18:56.320]  um, you know, where they're advertising the iOS apps, they're, um, integrating with Dropbox.
[1:18:56.880 --> 1:19:01.920]  I just saw in the other day this week where now that you can do, um, they have a thing where
[1:19:01.920 --> 1:19:07.840]  they're running on Google's cloud service. Oh, yeah. Right? You can run exchange and, um,
[1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:15.040]  you know, run Windows servers and Google's cloud. All of those things are signs that they now,
[1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:21.200]  they're, they're, they're off of that, you know, Microsoft only all the way down the stack.
[1:19:23.200 --> 1:19:28.560]  Uh, and I guess we should also disclose they've also, you know, sponsored your podcast and your app.
[1:19:28.560 --> 1:19:34.720]  Yeah, which, yeah, you know, totally exactly. It's a good point. No, absolutely. Yeah. And I tell you
[1:19:34.720 --> 1:19:40.080]  the fact that, uh, Azure and all the window, you know, all their, all their cloud-based services
[1:19:40.080 --> 1:19:47.200]  are absolutely positively not designed as cloud services for Microsoft client devices. They are
[1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:54.400]  designed as cloud, uh, uh, what's the word, um, agnostic. Yeah. You know, they're just, they're just
[1:19:54.400 --> 1:20:02.080]  good cloud services. Yeah. So I'm very interested to see, uh, what, what some of the most, you know,
[1:20:02.080 --> 1:20:08.160]  balmary Microsoft stuff. What happens to that? Like those, those stores that were kind of crappy
[1:20:08.160 --> 1:20:14.480]  rip off of Apple stores, um, you know, what happens to those now? Uh, that kind of stuff. But we'll,
[1:20:14.480 --> 1:20:19.680]  we'll see. It's, you know, it's only been, uh, so less than a year. So I'll tell you a company who I
[1:20:19.680 --> 1:20:25.760]  think has a bad institutional taste is Amazon. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Totally. Really, you know what? And I
[1:20:25.760 --> 1:20:31.840]  think that's what that's exactly what inspired me to ask you about this was thinking about that,
[1:20:31.840 --> 1:20:38.800]  that, that phone, man. That environment phone. Oh, yeah. Did you ever, do you ever use one?
[1:20:38.800 --> 1:20:44.960]  No, I haven't yet. Yeah, I have any there. But boy, the reviews were bad. And now that it's been
[1:20:44.960 --> 1:20:50.080]  on the market for a while, and I've seen a little bit more like random, a few random people who just
[1:20:50.080 --> 1:20:56.240]  picked one up on a lark. It's, uh, it's even worse. Like the, the, the things I've seen from people
[1:20:56.240 --> 1:21:02.480]  who aren't like gadget reviewers from the verge or whatever site, people who just review a lot of
[1:21:02.480 --> 1:21:08.800]  phones, where the fire phone was, in my opinion, very poorly reviewed in general. But the, just real
[1:21:08.800 --> 1:21:13.360]  people who don't do it, who just bought it to see what it's like, really just scorched it. It's,
[1:21:13.360 --> 1:21:20.720]  it's bad in every way. And it's funny because I like Amazon as a service, like I probably spend more
[1:21:20.720 --> 1:21:26.960]  money on Amazon than any other place besides my, you know, whoever owns my apartment building,
[1:21:26.960 --> 1:21:33.760]  but, uh, just the, you know, they've never had a good looking website. All their hardware stuff just
[1:21:33.760 --> 1:21:39.440]  screams out, you know, either we're just doing this to do it, or we don't really care that much
[1:21:39.440 --> 1:21:46.400]  about how good it is to use. Um, you know, the scathing reviews of the, the Kindle, the newest Kindle
[1:21:46.400 --> 1:21:51.440]  saying, you know, look, this is supposed to be the, the top end e-reader in the world. Why don't
[1:21:51.440 --> 1:21:57.120]  you treat it like that? They've never had good page turning on a Kindle ever. Yeah. It's the most
[1:21:57.120 --> 1:22:02.720]  astounding thing in all of consumer electronics that, and it, it, it's not astounding that the
[1:22:02.720 --> 1:22:08.320]  first one or the second one or maybe even the third one didn't have great page turning. But it's
[1:22:08.320 --> 1:22:13.600]  astounding to me that it really has never gotten, you know, just iteratively better year after year.
[1:22:13.600 --> 1:22:19.520]  And at this point, after, you know, seven or eight years on the market that they don't have
[1:22:19.520 --> 1:22:27.360]  page turning down is crazy. Or even like justifying the text, you know, forcing it to be fully,
[1:22:27.360 --> 1:22:32.640]  you know, the full width of the screen and not letting you left justify it. I just, I wrote about this
[1:22:32.640 --> 1:22:37.440]  a few, I wrote about this a few weeks ago. It's a solved computational problem. It's not easy,
[1:22:37.440 --> 1:22:44.560]  but it solved. And there are even open source solutions to it. Tech, the T lowercase e capital X
[1:22:45.760 --> 1:22:52.880]  type setting system that Donald Nuth created, you know, back in the 70s. There's an open,
[1:22:52.880 --> 1:23:00.320]  you know, I linked to an academic paper that one of his students wrote in like 1980 that just,
[1:23:00.320 --> 1:23:08.880]  you know, and it's not, it's a solved problem to do proper justification without unseemly gaps
[1:23:08.880 --> 1:23:15.280]  between words and with intelligent use of hyphenation. It's, it's a solved problem and yet they
[1:23:15.280 --> 1:23:21.600]  don't do it in the Kindle. It's crazy. Yeah. I have good fonts. They don't, you know, the font
[1:23:21.600 --> 1:23:29.280]  selection is atrocious. And it's not like, it's not like having good fonts and good line, you know,
[1:23:29.280 --> 1:23:36.240]  layout isn't a core part of what the device, it's the whole point of the device. It would be like,
[1:23:36.240 --> 1:23:42.480]  it would be like if the iPods didn't really have good music playback. Right. Yeah. Although
[1:23:42.480 --> 1:23:46.560]  maybe some argue that they didn't, but still, you know, if you're, if you're trying to make the
[1:23:46.560 --> 1:23:51.600]  best reading device in the world, which I guess they're not, you know, they would, they would
[1:23:51.600 --> 1:23:56.480]  certainly act more like it or maybe they're doing the best they can, which is where the, the
[1:23:56.480 --> 1:24:02.560]  institutional taste comes in. It's just that they don't. The difference is that most people
[1:24:02.560 --> 1:24:09.760]  view a book as a string, meaning, you know what I mean? Like in programming terms that it's
[1:24:09.760 --> 1:24:15.840]  right, a string of text and that if you review somebody's novel, it doesn't really matter
[1:24:15.840 --> 1:24:22.400]  what nobody, I've never seen different, you know, and it just indicates what I'm obsessed with,
[1:24:22.400 --> 1:24:26.960]  but I've never seen a book review that includes a review of the layout of the book. Whereas if I
[1:24:26.960 --> 1:24:32.720]  reviewed a book, I would, I would, I'd be tempted to do that. Like to me, I sort of, it's clearly
[1:24:32.720 --> 1:24:37.600]  it's not the main reason you read a novel. And I guess in general, I would rather read an
[1:24:37.600 --> 1:24:43.840]  interesting, well-written novel that's poorly typeset than read a terrible novel that is beautifully
[1:24:43.840 --> 1:24:48.480]  typeset, of course. That's the different, but then, and even me as somebody obsessed with typography
[1:24:48.480 --> 1:24:52.960]  would agree with that. Whereas with music, nobody ever says, I don't care if the music sounds bad,
[1:24:52.960 --> 1:24:58.240]  you know, like at a technical level. It's fundamental to listening to music. But as the person
[1:24:58.240 --> 1:25:02.720]  making the device, it should be, you know, you should, that should be the obsession. You know,
[1:25:02.720 --> 1:25:07.680]  the people making kindles, at the top level of the design team should be people who are
[1:25:07.680 --> 1:25:13.440]  obsessed with good typography. It's criminal that they're not. But I think it's a sign of
[1:25:13.440 --> 1:25:20.240]  amazon's institutional taste. They're priorities. I think that nails it. I'm going to take a
[1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:25.680]  moment here and thank our good friends at Harries. Now, if you're a regular listener of the show,
[1:25:25.680 --> 1:25:30.480]  you know what Harries makes. They make high quality men's shaving products. They come in amazing
[1:25:30.480 --> 1:25:35.360]  packages. They make their own blades. They built their own razor blade factory, or they bought a
[1:25:35.360 --> 1:25:39.840]  razor blade factory in Germany. They make their own blades. They've got great high quality handles,
[1:25:39.840 --> 1:25:48.800]  shaving creams, foam, foaming gels. After shave, you name it. If it is a shaving product,
[1:25:48.800 --> 1:25:55.440]  they make it. And it's great quality at amazing prices compared to the mass market stuff you
[1:25:55.440 --> 1:26:03.120]  buy in drug stores. Really great stuff. Well, look, it's the holidays. And if you're listening
[1:26:03.120 --> 1:26:09.520]  to this show, honor before December 17th, they have a fantastic holiday offer for you. Use this
[1:26:09.520 --> 1:26:16.480]  code. Talk show holiday. All one word. Talk show holiday. That's not the regular code. That's the
[1:26:16.480 --> 1:26:22.800]  one just for this holiday offer. What that code gets you is it gets you five bucks off their winter
[1:26:22.800 --> 1:26:30.560]  Winston set. The winter Winston set comes with a chrome handle, three of their high quality blades,
[1:26:30.560 --> 1:26:39.760]  and either their shaving gel or the foam, your choice. It's already wrapped. And you know how
[1:26:39.760 --> 1:26:46.640]  cool their packaging is. It is a fantastic gift. You might never think to give shaving products
[1:26:46.640 --> 1:26:52.080]  as a gift, you know, regular jalette or crap like that. Harry's, though, I think this would make
[1:26:52.080 --> 1:27:00.800]  a fantastic gift. So go to Harry's dot com. Use this code. Talk show holiday and order the winner
[1:27:00.800 --> 1:27:07.920]  Winston set. Save five bucks for anybody on your shopping list. Great deal. Great product. Great
[1:27:07.920 --> 1:27:14.960]  offer. My thanks to Harry's. All right. Last bit. So last bit. So let's let's talk about Instagram
[1:27:14.960 --> 1:27:24.720]  which just announced 300 million active users, which is almost entirely likely more than Twitter
[1:27:24.720 --> 1:27:31.200]  has at this point. Twitter has not yet released their December quarter numbers and it's a little
[1:27:31.200 --> 1:27:35.120]  different because they do the quarterly average. But yeah. And if you look at the graph, though, it's
[1:27:35.120 --> 1:27:41.440]  pretty clear that Instagram is growing faster. Yeah. And it's pretty amazing. I think it's, you know,
[1:27:41.440 --> 1:27:49.360]  it's certainly the number two or number three app that I check after I wake up. And it's,
[1:27:49.360 --> 1:27:54.240]  it's kind of cool that, you know, even after Facebook bought them, although that kind of maybe
[1:27:54.240 --> 1:27:59.520]  gives them an edge to although Facebook hasn't really integrated as much as it could have
[1:28:00.240 --> 1:28:04.160]  that it's still growing so quickly still feels like very much of its own thing.
[1:28:04.160 --> 1:28:09.040]  I think it totally does. I would say as somebody who doesn't use Facebook and therefore was
[1:28:09.040 --> 1:28:12.720]  and for very specific reasons that it just doesn't appeal to me. When they bought Instagram,
[1:28:12.720 --> 1:28:18.000]  I and I was a big fan of Instagram, I was very worried. And they said, oh, but we're not going to
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:22.560]  mess with it. We're not going to Facebook guys that we're doing the Let Kevin system and his team,
[1:28:22.560 --> 1:28:26.640]  you know, we bought them because we love what they're doing and we're going to have them keep
[1:28:26.640 --> 1:28:30.240]  doing what they're doing. And it's like, I've heard that before. Right. You hear that every time
[1:28:30.240 --> 1:28:35.440]  there's a popular thing gets acquired. You hear it's not going to get, we're not going to mess it up.
[1:28:35.440 --> 1:28:41.440]  And most of the time it gets messed up eventually. And I would say from the outside,
[1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:47.680]  that's an Instagram user, it's completely true. If I didn't follow tech news, I would have no
[1:28:47.680 --> 1:28:55.520]  idea that Instagram was bought by Facebook. So I made a kind of a jerky tweet the other day.
[1:28:55.520 --> 1:29:00.240]  But one of the things that surprised me the most is, you know, and you could say like,
[1:29:00.240 --> 1:29:05.840]  oh, are they just kind of napping over there? They've changed it so little that it almost
[1:29:05.840 --> 1:29:11.280]  could seem like it's negligence. Not that I think that they should throw a bunch of features at it.
[1:29:11.280 --> 1:29:16.320]  But there's a lot of little things that I think are still missing from Instagram that
[1:29:17.920 --> 1:29:22.960]  they would really actually make it better. For example, you know, something as simple as
[1:29:22.960 --> 1:29:27.360]  being able to have multiple users in the app so that, you know, I know a woman who runs
[1:29:27.360 --> 1:29:32.400]  for Instagram accounts for three restaurants and her personal one. And every time you want to switch
[1:29:32.400 --> 1:29:37.440]  accounts, you literally have to sign out and then sign in with your username and password.
[1:29:37.440 --> 1:29:43.440]  Yeah, conceptually Instagram is very similar to Twitter. It's it and comparing Twitter to Facebook
[1:29:43.440 --> 1:29:49.600]  is difficult because it's just different purposes, very different design. But fundamentally,
[1:29:49.600 --> 1:29:57.040]  Instagram is Twitter for pictures. Yep. And combined with that instead of having replies,
[1:29:57.040 --> 1:30:01.600]  you have comments on the picture. And so it's slightly different ordered. The pictures are still
[1:30:01.600 --> 1:30:07.120]  Twitter order, newest at the top, oldest at the bottom. The only real conceptual difference in the
[1:30:07.120 --> 1:30:12.080]  main timeline is that comments go under the picture they're commenting on as opposed to Twitter
[1:30:12.080 --> 1:30:18.160]  where the replies are all in a chronological stream as well. Yeah. Very, very similar. And so
[1:30:18.160 --> 1:30:22.560]  therefore I completely agree with you. It makes every bit of sense that you could have multiple
[1:30:22.560 --> 1:30:28.880]  accounts in Instagram that it does in Twitter. Right. And it's something like that where another
[1:30:28.880 --> 1:30:36.080]  one is like hyperlinks like you, you can't even link a comment which you can't put a link in a
[1:30:36.080 --> 1:30:43.120]  comment or anywhere really, which on one hand cuts down spam. You don't have as much people spamming
[1:30:43.120 --> 1:30:50.800]  links. On the other hand, you see people like both humans and companies saying, here's something
[1:30:50.800 --> 1:30:57.680]  we did to access it. Go to our bio and click the link in our bio. Yeah, that's that's that's
[1:30:57.680 --> 1:31:03.120]  a hack. It's a clever hack, but it's still it's like, you know, these are places where a competitor
[1:31:03.120 --> 1:31:08.000]  could eventually catch catch hold. Another one is shopping like there. And now they're in the US,
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:12.800]  there's a company called spring. And in Japan, there's a company called origami that, you know,
[1:31:12.800 --> 1:31:19.040]  are basically Instagram with a buy button attached to it. And even just a hyperlink from Instagram
[1:31:19.040 --> 1:31:25.760]  would do so much to make services like that unnecessary. And I wonder if it's Instagram just keeping
[1:31:25.760 --> 1:31:30.240]  things really simple because that's what works. And it's really hard to argue with that, you know,
[1:31:30.240 --> 1:31:37.440]  you know, they've done so well. Or if, you know, a few little features like that could really
[1:31:37.440 --> 1:31:44.160]  have gone a long way. Yeah. And if the hyperlinks work the way they do in almost all Twitter clients
[1:31:44.160 --> 1:31:48.880]  where instead of bouncing you out to a third party browser, it opens a web view right there in the
[1:31:48.880 --> 1:31:54.880]  app. You're not even losing the engagement because when they close the web view, they're probably
[1:31:54.880 --> 1:31:59.920]  going to be right back where they were in Instagram. So I don't think it's about like engagement
[1:31:59.920 --> 1:32:06.720]  trapman, right? Right. I can only guess that it's a spam thing. But even then, I feel like that's
[1:32:06.720 --> 1:32:12.800]  making us the user suffer for a problem that they're supposed to solve. Yeah, right?
[1:32:12.800 --> 1:32:16.640]  I mean, imagine if Twitter said, oh, we're getting rid of all links because of spam. I mean,
[1:32:17.360 --> 1:32:22.640]  you know, just no, you can't do that. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah, I would think that the way that they would do
[1:32:22.640 --> 1:32:27.440]  it would be to follow Twitter's lead and do their own T co thing. Because that's that's fundamental
[1:32:27.440 --> 1:32:31.680]  to Twitter's anti, I know that they do other things too and that they, you know, they track all
[1:32:31.680 --> 1:32:36.320]  sorts of analytics through all the links that go through Twitter now that they're all redirected
[1:32:36.320 --> 1:32:42.400]  through t.co. But part of it too is that let's them centralize spam and malware and that kind of
[1:32:42.400 --> 1:32:48.400]  that's right. Right. Any kind of bad, anything I say spam meaning anything that would that is like,
[1:32:48.400 --> 1:32:54.720]  oh, we should delete that and identify the user as a, you know, yeah, they turn it out the lights
[1:32:54.720 --> 1:32:58.080]  on you. I know I haven't been kicked out. You know, it's funny. There's supposed to be another
[1:32:58.080 --> 1:33:02.240]  meeting in here right now. Email the person asking if I can use the room. So they might show up
[1:33:02.240 --> 1:33:07.920]  angrily any minute now. But so we could sign off on a moment to notice, but I heard I heard a loud
[1:33:07.920 --> 1:33:13.760]  click on that. That was, that was me missing, missing the garbage can with my seltzer. Sorry about that.
[1:33:13.760 --> 1:33:20.720]  So another feature is the, you know, the equivalent of the reblog, the regram. And I could totally
[1:33:20.720 --> 1:33:26.240]  see why they don't, why they don't have that feature because, you know, then it's all your photos
[1:33:26.240 --> 1:33:31.440]  and it's more authentic and it's not a bunch of junk. But on the other hand, people are hacking that
[1:33:31.440 --> 1:33:37.200]  and there are apps that will let you, you know, do this regram even a video with an overlay and that
[1:33:37.200 --> 1:33:43.120]  kind of stuff. Have you seen those? No, I haven't. Okay. Well, I see. But I can, I know what you mean
[1:33:43.120 --> 1:33:47.840]  though. It's probably not even like 5% of the pictures in my feet. And I'm sure if there were
[1:33:47.840 --> 1:33:53.520]  regramming, it would be more than that. But it's still interesting that that's the kind of thing
[1:33:53.520 --> 1:34:00.480]  where pretty much every other stream based social network has added that feature, you know,
[1:34:00.480 --> 1:34:07.120]  whether it's tumblers, reblog or on Vine, you can rewind on Twitter, you can retweet on Instagram,
[1:34:07.120 --> 1:34:12.640]  you basically have to reupload a photo. I would almost say it's the defining feature of tumbler.
[1:34:12.640 --> 1:34:17.920]  Yeah, yeah, probably. Yeah, that's interesting. And it's hard. You have to end from a phone,
[1:34:17.920 --> 1:34:23.120]  you're kind of stuck because you can't just save an Instagram to your local thing and pick it out
[1:34:23.120 --> 1:34:26.720]  and put it back in. You've got to do goofy stuff like most usually, I guess when I do see it's
[1:34:26.720 --> 1:34:31.600]  usually just like a screenshot. It's a screenshot. And there are apps that do this. It's like regram
[1:34:31.600 --> 1:34:37.360]  app or something like that. And these are, you know, these are all, I'm sure, decisions that they've
[1:34:37.360 --> 1:34:41.840]  made and they seem to have just decided no for all of them. And again, it's really hard to argue
[1:34:41.840 --> 1:34:49.280]  with them. They've, whatever they're doing is working so well that you almost can't argue
[1:34:49.280 --> 1:34:54.000]  that they could be doing better. And they've made little changes like the Explorer screen
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:35:00.480]  is so much more interesting now that they are basing it on your friends and people you follow.
[1:35:00.480 --> 1:35:06.240]  So that's great. The, the image tools that they built, the, you know, not just the filters,
[1:35:06.240 --> 1:35:10.800]  but the, the different image tools are really, really, really good, you know what?
[1:35:10.800 --> 1:35:18.240]  I also think that they have excellent notification controls because I easily, and without any
[1:35:18.240 --> 1:35:26.640]  confusion, set up Instagram so that I'm only notified when people who I follow do something of
[1:35:26.640 --> 1:35:32.000]  interest. Like, I don't want notifications when any Joe on the internet favorite, one of my
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:36.880]  Instagrams. I only want ones, you know, I get very few. Can you believe people leave that on?
[1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:42.880]  Like, I'll pick up someone's phone sometimes and they'll have 40. I will not name names because
[1:35:42.880 --> 1:35:49.840]  I find it to be such a curiously needy feature, but I do, I have definitely seen people who have
[1:35:49.840 --> 1:35:55.280]  that turned on. And people, I look, I look at see who, you know, who likes my photos. That's,
[1:35:55.280 --> 1:35:58.400]  I think that's one of the most interesting parts of that. Oh, yeah, but I don't want
[1:35:58.400 --> 1:36:03.440]  notifications. I don't know. I'm, I'm not, it's not like I don't care. And I don't like
[1:36:03.440 --> 1:36:07.760]  look back at yesterday's thing and then open up the rest and see it, but I don't want notifications
[1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:12.240]  for it. Totally. And then another one is like, they don't have an iPad app. And that's a huge,
[1:36:12.240 --> 1:36:16.480]  it drives me crazy because it's actually, you know, at first, people were like, wow, why would
[1:36:16.480 --> 1:36:21.440]  you use Instagram on an iPad? Who's taking photos on an iPad? Well, the answer is a lot of people
[1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:28.400]  take photos on an iPad. And I look at a ton of Instagram on the iPad. And it's actually gotten better.
[1:36:28.400 --> 1:36:32.960]  It's actually, well, it's really great on the iPhone 6 Plus. And it's gotten a little better over
[1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:41.360]  the years as the 2X multiplication set up on the iPad has gotten a little better. But it's still,
[1:36:41.360 --> 1:36:45.840]  it's like, come on, is it really, isn't that hard to make an iPad app? Maybe it is. I don't know.
[1:36:45.840 --> 1:36:53.280]  No, not in broad strokes, not. Now, once you can, it might be depending on how your app was
[1:36:53.280 --> 1:36:59.680]  architected, but if you're able to support the new iPhone 6 sizes, then you're doing stuff that
[1:36:59.680 --> 1:37:07.760]  makes it really easy to do iPad too. And in fact, it's so easy that it with this whole size class
[1:37:07.760 --> 1:37:13.920]  thing. And, you know, it was a huge, huge point of emphasis at WWDC this year. It's a huge part
[1:37:13.920 --> 1:37:19.600]  of iOS 8. All of it clearly was about setting things up so that apps were ready for the iPhone 6
[1:37:19.600 --> 1:37:28.400]  with the new two new sizes. But it's so, creating an iPad app now is really almost almost
[1:37:28.400 --> 1:37:34.880]  like just creating another bigger iPhone size. If you can do the 6 and 6S, you can do the iPad.
[1:37:34.880 --> 1:37:40.000]  And I say that even though Vesper, which does support the 6 and 6S, still doesn't have an iPad
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:44.080]  version, but if we really wanted to drop everything else, we were doing and do that, it actually
[1:37:44.080 --> 1:37:50.320]  wouldn't be that much work. And Marco even talked about that with Overcast where he got an
[1:37:50.320 --> 1:37:55.680]  app, he called it an accidental version of an iPad version of Overcast.
[1:37:55.680 --> 1:38:00.240]  Oh, yeah, remember, yeah. Because there was a bug where if you used a storyboard for your startup
[1:38:00.240 --> 1:38:06.000]  screen, it didn't matter if you also specified in your XML that, hey, that me, this app,
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:11.120]  I'm iPhone only. So if I'm running on an iPad, run me in the iPhone mode,
[1:38:12.640 --> 1:38:17.200]  the OS had a bug where if you had that storyboard as your startup image, it would say,
[1:38:17.200 --> 1:38:22.560]  oh, you're a modern app. So I'll run you as an iPad app. And it actually, without him ever even
[1:38:22.560 --> 1:38:29.840]  intending it or trying it, it actually was usable. So yes, at this point, it seems like there's
[1:38:29.840 --> 1:38:33.360]  no technical reason why Instagram should not have an iPad app.
[1:38:33.360 --> 1:38:39.200]  And then one more is the icon. I mean, you know, every, literally every app on my iPhone home screen
[1:38:39.200 --> 1:38:48.560]  has done something a little more iOS 7 inspired. I can almost see it. I'm not an icon artist,
[1:38:48.560 --> 1:38:55.920]  but I can almost see what the flat Instagram icon would look like. Keep the colors,
[1:38:55.920 --> 1:39:04.000]  keep the basic gimmick that it looks like a Polaroid and just flatten it. Right. So is this,
[1:39:04.960 --> 1:39:09.920]  and they're not not doing these things to spite people. So I just wonder, and I guess I should
[1:39:09.920 --> 1:39:16.320]  probably be a good journalist and ask them. And maybe I will, but it's still a, it's a frequent
[1:39:16.320 --> 1:39:22.160]  user. It has, it has puzzled me over the years. And especially recently, as you see that it is,
[1:39:22.160 --> 1:39:27.680]  you know, arguably the second or third most important social network in the world
[1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:34.320]  that, you know, and I totally am on the side of simplicity and saying no and all that stuff.
[1:39:34.320 --> 1:39:39.840]  But yeah, well, I think that your bucket list right there, your checklist of what Instagram
[1:39:39.840 --> 1:39:45.840]  would should do is excellent because it does, to me, it doesn't add any complexity.
[1:39:45.840 --> 1:39:50.240]  Like supporting the iPad doesn't make using Instagram more complex. It just makes it better,
[1:39:50.240 --> 1:39:54.400]  you know, and in addition, I'll just throw out this point in addition to the fact that you're
[1:39:54.400 --> 1:39:59.600]  right that a lot of people and Apple even admits it now that a lot of people use their iPad as
[1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:06.240]  a camera for, for producing iPad or Instagram content. But clearly, photography is something that
[1:40:06.240 --> 1:40:12.080]  always looks better, bigger, always. So it would be better if you had both, you know, side by side,
[1:40:12.080 --> 1:40:18.160]  it would always be better to look at Instagram on the iPad. I think when they eventually do,
[1:40:18.160 --> 1:40:21.600]  I think they will, right? They're going to come out with an iPad app. I think when they do,
[1:40:21.600 --> 1:40:25.680]  people are going to be like, wow, this is amazing. I can't believe that they didn't do this before.
[1:40:25.680 --> 1:40:30.080]  Totally. All right. So if you're Kevin's system, get on it, man.
[1:40:31.040 --> 1:40:35.360]  And you know what? And understand like that, you know, as part of Facebook, they've had to
[1:40:35.360 --> 1:40:41.440]  build out an advertising business. And I find their ads to be totally fine. Like they're not,
[1:40:41.440 --> 1:40:46.080]  you know, I look at them and I see, oh, that's kind of cheesy. So that's an ad, but I'm not mad that
[1:40:46.080 --> 1:40:50.960]  it's there. And I know that they have to build a business. So I'm happy that they're doing that.
[1:40:50.960 --> 1:40:55.120]  And maybe that's, you know, maybe they're waiting on adding hyperlinks until they have a commerce
[1:40:55.120 --> 1:41:05.360]  business of some sort. But it just, you know, it makes me maybe like them a little less, I guess.
[1:41:05.360 --> 1:41:08.400]  Yeah, wonder if that's what they're holding out for that you're only going to get,
[1:41:08.960 --> 1:41:13.360]  you only get links if you pay for it. I don't know, but that doesn't make, yeah, just,
[1:41:13.360 --> 1:41:18.960]  I don't, I don't know if that helps anyone either. So cool. All right, well, I love Instagram and
[1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:24.320]  I'm not, you know, I'm not trying to be a jerk. But I think one way that you can measure, and I
[1:41:24.320 --> 1:41:28.640]  know that this monthly active viewers thing is like the industry standard numerically, but I feel
[1:41:28.640 --> 1:41:34.880]  like the way that you can, the better way to measure social networks is when you're out in the real
[1:41:34.880 --> 1:41:39.920]  world. And you look at like the menu at the restaurant you're at or the window of the place where
[1:41:39.920 --> 1:41:45.600]  you're going to buy, you know, a baked goods or something like that, which icons do they have
[1:41:46.160 --> 1:41:51.680]  there, right? And for a long time, it was just Facebook and Twitter, a lot of places I saw.
[1:41:52.720 --> 1:41:57.680]  Or YouTube or yeah, yeah, yeah, depending on, you know, yeah, sometimes YouTube, but usually
[1:41:57.680 --> 1:42:05.360]  a big one, it was Facebook and Twitter, the pairing. And man, I see Instagram everywhere now.
[1:42:05.360 --> 1:42:10.880]  I don't know, I should, I'll actually, I'm going to make an effort now that if I see Facebook and
[1:42:10.880 --> 1:42:15.280]  Twitter, but don't see Instagram, I'll take a picture of it and start collecting it. And I'll bet
[1:42:15.280 --> 1:42:21.600]  I don't, I bet I don't get many of them. I see Instagram everywhere. It's clearly on part with Twitter
[1:42:21.600 --> 1:42:28.720]  in terms of that. And I would even add, it's going back to Eric Jackson's thing, I do see the
[1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:34.080]  Pinterest logo a lot more places now, not as much as those as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram,
[1:42:34.080 --> 1:42:39.520]  but it's growing. Yeah, yeah, I think so, especially anything with like a visual component to it,
[1:42:40.880 --> 1:42:48.640]  shopping, food, you know, that sort of stuff. I actually think, you know, not to get
[1:42:49.520 --> 1:42:54.960]  too deep on this, but I actually think that companies make better Instagrammers than they make
[1:42:54.960 --> 1:43:01.920]  Twitter users. I think that, you know, I follow a lot of restaurants and stores that I've been to
[1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:07.440]  on vacations and that kind of thing on Instagram, you know, even even places I may never go back to
[1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:12.240]  just to kind of remember them that I would never follow on Twitter because on Twitter they're
[1:43:12.240 --> 1:43:17.280]  talking, you know, here are our daily specials or something like that or here's a link to a
[1:43:17.280 --> 1:43:22.720]  story that we were mentioned in. Whereas on Instagram, they're showing photos of their shop or
[1:43:22.720 --> 1:43:26.800]  their neighborhood or of their products or of their customers and that kind of stuff. And I actually
[1:43:26.800 --> 1:43:31.280]  find it really interesting. I follow the official Yankees account on Instagram and Twitter.
[1:43:31.280 --> 1:43:37.280]  And on Twitter, a lot of the time when they tweet, my finger starts hovering towards the
[1:43:37.280 --> 1:43:44.400]  unfollow button. And on Instagram, it's almost always great. It's like a some kind of picture of,
[1:43:44.400 --> 1:43:50.080]  you know, either something going on in the current Yankees season and from a staff member with
[1:43:50.080 --> 1:43:55.360]  incredible access, right? Like, you know, on the field at batting practice, like a great angle
[1:43:55.360 --> 1:44:02.640]  of something or it's like a piece of history, like a history. And it always makes me smile.
[1:44:02.640 --> 1:44:06.880]  It's like exactly why I wanted to follow them on Instagram. Whereas on Twitter, it's just a
[1:44:06.880 --> 1:44:11.680]  bunch of hashtags and shit. Yeah. Where, you know, and this is like maybe to close out,
[1:44:11.680 --> 1:44:17.200]  you know, Evan Williams yesterday, it was quoted. I think in Fortune saying, I don't give a
[1:44:17.200 --> 1:44:23.440]  shit if Twitter has more users than Instagram, which is well put. And by the way, aside,
[1:44:23.440 --> 1:44:29.280]  Evan Williams is working way harder than Evan Williams needs to be working. He's really
[1:44:29.280 --> 1:44:35.760]  done a great job with medium. And I'm really impressed by that. Anyway, but I think he's right.
[1:44:35.760 --> 1:44:40.960]  I think that Twitter and Instagram like comparing them because you have the same metric monthly
[1:44:40.960 --> 1:44:46.640]  active users. Sure, that's that's fair, but they really are different products. Yeah, you know,
[1:44:46.640 --> 1:44:52.800]  and there's obviously bad blood because Twitter probably could have and should have bought
[1:44:53.680 --> 1:44:59.360]  Instagram and, you know, in Facebook, you know, that kind of thing. But yeah, and I think in their
[1:44:59.360 --> 1:45:05.440]  buyers remorse over not having bought them is why they bought Vine and Vine is, you know,
[1:45:05.440 --> 1:45:09.440]  I don't think it's a failure, but it's not at that level. Yeah, I don't still exist. But and it's
[1:45:09.440 --> 1:45:14.160]  doing some interesting stuff, but it's not Instagram. Nobody's putting Vine logos on their restaurant
[1:45:14.160 --> 1:45:20.080]  windows. No, I mean, I just know the joke, but it's a really good sign of real world, you know,
[1:45:20.080 --> 1:45:25.120]  awareness. I'll tell you another thing I noticed about Instagram is I, when I go to like
[1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:31.120]  sporting like a Yankee game or something like that, I see people taking Instagrams and using
[1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:36.160]  Instagram more on their phone more than I see them tweeting. Do you want to hear something funny?
[1:45:37.120 --> 1:45:44.080]  Is that while we've been taping this podcast about 20 people I work with have stopped by this
[1:45:44.080 --> 1:45:49.280]  conference room and taking pictures of me through the glass. And I bet they're going to wind up
[1:45:49.280 --> 1:45:55.120]  on Instagram and not on Twitter. If you see them send them to me. Yeah, I will put them together.
[1:45:55.120 --> 1:45:59.280]  Yeah, it's been very strange. Like, you know, the first couple I was like, I have very funny and
[1:45:59.920 --> 1:46:06.160]  like 10 people have taken pictures of me. But anyway, my bigger point is like Twitter and Instagram
[1:46:06.160 --> 1:46:11.840]  are not really the same thing. I mean, Twitter is like breaking news from the from the front's,
[1:46:11.840 --> 1:46:19.120]  you know, the war fronts in in Ferguson, although I guess Instagram, you know, people were posting
[1:46:19.120 --> 1:46:24.720]  photos and that kind of stuff. But you know, Twitter is like the global pulse of information and
[1:46:24.720 --> 1:46:31.040]  Instagram is, you know, look how cool my life is, that kind of thing. So yeah, or look at this,
[1:46:31.040 --> 1:46:35.520]  look at this, yeah, or look at this thing or look at where I am. Yeah, here's where I am. If anything,
[1:46:35.520 --> 1:46:41.360]  Instagram has destroyed something like four square more than more than it has really affected Twitter
[1:46:41.360 --> 1:46:45.760]  and Twitter's, Twitter's problems are its own problems. You know, there are so many things
[1:46:45.760 --> 1:46:50.720]  that Twitter needs to figure out. But competing with Instagram, I don't think is the answer.
[1:46:51.520 --> 1:46:57.600]  And being upset that, you know, or people trying to make them look small because Instagram has
[1:46:57.600 --> 1:47:03.760]  more users. I don't think that has anything to do with it. Yeah, it's the same concept. It's just,
[1:47:03.760 --> 1:47:08.960]  you pick a list of people or certain, you know, companies and you will see a chronological
[1:47:08.960 --> 1:47:13.520]  stream of what they post. Same concept as Twitter, but in practice, because of the differences
[1:47:13.520 --> 1:47:18.400]  in what it is, you know, photos versus text, it ends up having a very different purpose.
[1:47:19.360 --> 1:47:22.640]  And in fact, what you just said is actually kind of interesting because it's almost like
[1:47:22.640 --> 1:47:29.040]  Instagram is a better fulfillment of Twitter's original idea of its purpose. What am I doing
[1:47:29.040 --> 1:47:33.840]  right now? Right? It used to be like, what was the original prompt for Twitter? And if you
[1:47:33.840 --> 1:47:39.280]  go, uh, I don't know. It's like, what's up or, you know, what are you doing? What's going on?
[1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:42.720]  Yeah. Maybe that's what it is now. You know, and people used to tweet like in two,
[1:47:42.720 --> 1:47:48.480]  that's what's happening. Yeah, like at, at the dentist or something like that. Yeah. And like,
[1:47:48.480 --> 1:47:52.880]  nobody would tweet that anymore, right? Like nobody's going to tweet at the dentist,
[1:47:52.880 --> 1:47:57.760]  just those words. Um, but who will Steve Wozniak will.
[1:47:57.760 --> 1:48:04.400]  But I have definitely see like, when I see like friends, I see friends who take like a
[1:48:04.400 --> 1:48:08.480]  first person perspective of their feet in the dentist chair. Yeah. It's like,
[1:48:08.480 --> 1:48:11.840]  oh, you know, hope he's, you know, hope he's feeling like hope he doesn't have a bet, you know,
[1:48:11.840 --> 1:48:18.160]  some kind of tooth problem. Yeah, totally. And it fits. It, you know, you don't mind it if you
[1:48:18.160 --> 1:48:23.200]  can compose it artistically. No, I said this week when it, when that news, when that news broke.
[1:48:23.200 --> 1:48:26.880]  And again, like you said, I don't think it's any kind of bad news for Twitter that Instagram's
[1:48:26.880 --> 1:48:32.400]  bigger. It's just, it's just an interesting sign. It just, you know, and doesn't mean that
[1:48:32.400 --> 1:48:38.000]  they're even more valuable than Twitter. It's just interesting. Um, but I do think though that
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  their part of their success is that they've kept that simplicity and, and, and there's like a,
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:48.960]  they know the people running Instagram and designing it and keeping it. They know exactly what it
[1:48:48.960 --> 1:48:53.440]  is. And they get it. Whereas to me, part of Twitter's problem in recent years is that the people
[1:48:53.440 --> 1:48:59.360]  running Twitter don't seem to get what Twitter is. They're just, they've, they've seemingly,
[1:48:59.360 --> 1:49:04.800]  they, to me, they seem lost. And I think part of it is that they have this ambition to be as big
[1:49:04.800 --> 1:49:12.960]  as Facebook. And I think the problem is, is that what Twitter is good for is fundamentally never
[1:49:12.960 --> 1:49:20.080]  going to be as big and as profitable as what Facebook is. And so can you live with that, you know,
[1:49:20.080 --> 1:49:25.280]  why not if you, if it's still profitable? Yeah, I think that's a great way of putting it like,
[1:49:25.280 --> 1:49:34.640]  like if you make, uh, I don't know, uh, uh, toaster ovens and you find out that the toaster
[1:49:34.640 --> 1:49:39.840]  oven business is not as profitable as the automobile industry. Should you start making cars? No,
[1:49:39.840 --> 1:49:44.560]  I don't, you know, just, you know, keep making good toaster ovens. If, you know, and just let it be,
[1:49:44.560 --> 1:49:49.600]  let it be the business that it is, you know, and I just think that Twitter is so obsessed
[1:49:49.600 --> 1:49:55.920]  with Facebook that they've lost their way. Let a leadership level. Yeah. Or, or, well, I don't know if
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:50:02.400]  it's into, I don't know if they, if they think that way internally. I think that the, uh, the outside
[1:50:02.400 --> 1:50:08.080]  perspective, especially among the investor communities, like, well, why isn't Twitter becoming as
[1:50:08.080 --> 1:50:13.040]  big as well? My, my, my evidence that I think that there's, that they do it internally is the way
[1:50:13.040 --> 1:50:18.800]  that first person, or not first person, first party Twitter clients, meaning if you go to twitter.com
[1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:24.400]  and you're used the Twitter app, that your timeline is now has, is no longer just the simple
[1:50:24.400 --> 1:50:29.360]  chronological order of here to the people you follow in their tweets, you know, that there's all
[1:50:29.360 --> 1:50:34.880]  sorts of other stuff that's injected in there. You know, yeah, but I don't think that stems from
[1:50:35.520 --> 1:50:40.160]  trying to be more like Facebook. I think that is trying to solve the problem that most people
[1:50:40.160 --> 1:50:45.200]  have a shitty timeline because they don't follow enough people. They signed up for Twitter.
[1:50:45.200 --> 1:50:49.840]  They maybe, maybe followed auto followed the people that were suggested to them,
[1:50:50.480 --> 1:50:55.680]  but getting people to keep following more Twitter accounts is kind of essential to building a
[1:50:55.680 --> 1:51:02.640]  really great timeline. Like, I love my timeline. I also follow 3,300 people, uh, you know,
[1:51:02.640 --> 1:51:08.160]  and I even run out of stuff to read. So how do you automatically like pre install a really great
[1:51:08.160 --> 1:51:12.480]  timeline for someone that's based on what they like? And that's, I think that's what they're trying
[1:51:12.480 --> 1:51:17.280]  to get at with this algorithmic stuff. Uh, and what I would like to see from Twitter is
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:23.280]  exactly this like pre installed kit, like if you could go to the homepage and say show me
[1:51:23.280 --> 1:51:27.680]  soccer Twitter right now, boom, and I'm following a thousand accounts that a people are talking
[1:51:27.680 --> 1:51:33.040]  about really great soccer or let me see, tech media Twitter, you know, around an Apple event or
[1:51:33.040 --> 1:51:37.520]  something like that. Yeah, and don't be as simplistic as a hashtag, right? Like what they've got
[1:51:37.520 --> 1:51:42.240]  now is if you use the exact right hashtag, you can do it, but only if all the tweets are
[1:51:42.240 --> 1:51:50.000]  using the hashtag, whereas it seems, you know, Google Google web search seems like like existence
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:55.200]  proof that you could build something where you could just say soccer, like you said, and just
[1:51:55.200 --> 1:52:01.920]  get it figured out like here's some great soccer tweets to follow. So I think that's what they're
[1:52:01.920 --> 1:52:09.120]  trying to get at. And, you know, as is typical for Twitter, the worst thing they ever do is
[1:52:09.120 --> 1:52:15.920]  explain themselves. So they've done a typically poor job explaining why they're doing any of this
[1:52:15.920 --> 1:52:22.560]  stuff. And, you know, and now with new with yet another product leader who knows what they're
[1:52:22.560 --> 1:52:28.960]  going to keep working on, what they're not going to keep doing, although I will say the new guy
[1:52:28.960 --> 1:52:34.640]  in charge of product Kevin has been there forever. And, you know, if there's anyone I as a user
[1:52:34.640 --> 1:52:47.760]  trust to not be a hoser, it's him. So let's, all right, I can't beat that. Dan Fromer, thank
[1:52:47.760 --> 1:52:52.960]  you very much for your time. Where, where, where can people find out more from Dan Fromer?
[1:52:52.960 --> 1:53:01.120]  Oh, follow me on Twitter from Dom or on Instagram. If you want to see cute dog photos, I guess.
[1:53:01.120 --> 1:53:06.880]  Yeah, those are the best places to follow me now. Right now, I'm mostly writing at courts,
[1:53:06.880 --> 1:53:14.480]  which is qz.com. But you'll find all the best that from Dom linked from linking to the court
[1:53:14.480 --> 1:53:19.600]  stuff. Yeah, everything, everything I do, you know, wherever it is. Yeah, let's get you some
[1:53:19.600 --> 1:53:24.560]  Instagram followers. Yeah. Oh, and they're getting rid of all the spam accounts. So we'll see how
[1:53:24.560 --> 1:53:31.760]  many spam followers I have ends up. I was not following you on Instagram. Oh, but I'm decent on
[1:53:31.760 --> 1:53:37.600]  Instagram. Yeah, it's a little braggy. It's like, Hey, look at me. I'm in Tokyo, but so what, you know,
[1:53:37.600 --> 1:53:43.120]  I think that's what it's for. Yeah, I agree. I like it. Yeah. See, I didn't know you were in Tokyo.
[1:53:43.120 --> 1:53:47.760]  I'm not right now. I was. I know. I'm looking at the picture. I actually have some really great
[1:53:47.760 --> 1:53:53.040]  stories I'm working on from Tokyo that I was reporting in Tokyo that I'll be publishing over the
[1:53:53.040 --> 1:54:01.120]  next few weeks. I did two already. One, um, one was, uh, did you see that new, okay, go video?
[1:54:01.760 --> 1:54:07.600]  Yes, the one with the shot from a drone. Yeah. Yeah. So I went to, so I wasn't Tokyo, I think
[1:54:07.600 --> 1:54:12.480]  now three weeks ago, maybe, maybe something like that. So I emailed Honda and said, Hey, can I, uh,
[1:54:12.480 --> 1:54:19.200]  can I ride one of those things? And so I got to meet the guy who invented it and ride around one of
[1:54:19.200 --> 1:54:25.040]  those little scooters. They're called a uni cub. Uh, and that was awesome. That was super fun.
[1:54:25.040 --> 1:54:29.440]  So if you, if you search, uh, well, I don't even know how you would find this. I should put a link
[1:54:29.440 --> 1:54:36.480]  on my website to these stories sooner than later. Yeah. Um, and another thing is, uh, Toshiba,
[1:54:36.480 --> 1:54:43.760]  like, like most Japanese old Japanese tech companies is struggling with growth. Uh, so they took an
[1:54:43.760 --> 1:54:50.240]  old floppy disk factory in the suburbs of Tokyo and turned it into a clean room indoor
[1:54:50.240 --> 1:54:55.360]  lettuce farm. So I toured that and posted a bunch of photos of that. And that was super cool.
[1:54:55.360 --> 1:55:02.240]  I had to put on a kind of a half bunny suit and sterilized my camera. And, uh, but it was,
[1:55:02.240 --> 1:55:08.400]  it was awesome. It's a great shot. Yeah. It was very cool. So, uh, that stuff is on my Instagram,
[1:55:08.400 --> 1:55:15.200]  I guess actually it is. And, um, you can't link through to the stories because Instagram doesn't
[1:55:15.200 --> 1:55:45.040]  have any links, but because they're not listening to Dan from. Yeah, whatever.
