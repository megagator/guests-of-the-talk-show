[00:00.000 --> 00:03.360]  Peter Kafka, it's good to have you on my show.
[00:03.360 --> 00:05.280]  I did your show, God, that was years ago now
[00:05.280 --> 00:06.880]  at this point, isn't it?
[00:06.880 --> 00:09.400]  It was years ago, and then we had a crossover,
[00:09.400 --> 00:12.240]  and so I think this is our third podcast conversation.
[00:12.240 --> 00:13.840]  Thanks for having me, John.
[00:13.840 --> 00:14.800]  It's a pleasure.
[00:16.160 --> 00:20.400]  Before we get in to all of the streaming,
[00:20.400 --> 00:24.180]  Michigan-ness, we can just recap.
[00:24.180 --> 00:26.680]  Yesterday, we were recording on Wednesday.
[00:26.680 --> 00:29.520]  Yesterday, Apple had their remote, virtual,
[00:29.520 --> 00:32.600]  however you want to describe it, time flies event.
[00:34.120 --> 00:35.820]  I have presumed that you watched.
[00:37.120 --> 00:40.360]  I have watched, because I'm not in the business
[00:40.360 --> 00:43.480]  of paying a lot of attention to their watches and iPads,
[00:43.480 --> 00:46.040]  but when it came time to talk about content bundles,
[00:46.040 --> 00:47.600]  I perked up a little bit.
[00:47.600 --> 00:51.560]  The funny part about that is it's an hour event,
[00:51.560 --> 00:52.520]  nice and tight.
[00:53.480 --> 00:55.520]  They only announced really three things,
[00:55.520 --> 00:59.220]  new watches, new iPads, and a streaming bundle.
[00:59.220 --> 01:02.360]  The streaming bundle, I actually double-checked.
[01:02.360 --> 01:04.920]  My notes were under two minutes,
[01:04.920 --> 01:06.760]  and then I watched the video again.
[01:06.760 --> 01:08.780]  It was literally under two minutes.
[01:09.960 --> 01:14.520]  Yeah, it's Apple, and dutifully,
[01:14.520 --> 01:17.320]  people come out saying this is a game-changer, et cetera,
[01:17.320 --> 01:19.960]  because you have to, I think still reflexively,
[01:19.960 --> 01:21.720]  when Apple has an event, you have to justify
[01:21.720 --> 01:23.620]  the time spent paying attention to it,
[01:24.600 --> 01:25.760]  and it's much less now, right?
[01:25.760 --> 01:26.600]  You don't have to fly anywhere.
[01:26.600 --> 01:28.040]  It's just an hour-long webinar,
[01:28.040 --> 01:31.060]  so it's easier to go, yeah, I got some new stuff,
[01:31.060 --> 01:33.740]  but yeah, Apple was not overselling
[01:33.740 --> 01:35.440]  the importance of this bundle.
[01:35.440 --> 01:38.180]  No, but, well, we'll get into it then,
[01:38.180 --> 01:42.140]  but are you an Apple Watch wearer?
[01:43.600 --> 01:48.560]  I am, but I'm kind of reluctant about it.
[01:48.560 --> 01:50.520]  I was just taking it off my wrist to tell you
[01:50.520 --> 01:52.880]  what model it was, because I paid that little attention.
[01:52.880 --> 01:55.640]  It's a Series 3, and I won't say I was shocked
[01:55.640 --> 01:56.840]  when they came out with a new line,
[01:56.840 --> 01:59.120]  including the lower-end one that started at,
[01:59.120 --> 02:00.120]  what, was it 300 bucks?
[02:00.120 --> 02:02.960]  279, but it's like-
[02:02.960 --> 02:05.920]  For the SE, that's the cheap model?
[02:05.920 --> 02:09.120]  Well, it's the cheap, new model, right?
[02:09.120 --> 02:12.820]  It's a brand-new product, and it's sort of best thought of
[02:12.820 --> 02:17.740]  as last year's Series 5, but without the ECG,
[02:17.740 --> 02:21.500]  I always wanna say EKG, but ECG sensor.
[02:23.120 --> 02:25.240]  It's bananas, to me.
[02:25.240 --> 02:27.880]  I mean, I know they sell well, and people will ask me
[02:27.880 --> 02:28.920]  about my watch periodically.
[02:28.920 --> 02:30.480]  They'd say, hey, Apple Watch, how do you like it,
[02:30.480 --> 02:31.820]  and should I get the wireless version?
[02:31.820 --> 02:35.080]  And I'll say, it's an odometer, and I wear it,
[02:35.080 --> 02:38.400]  and when I don't wear it, I feel bad that I didn't wear it,
[02:38.400 --> 02:40.720]  but that's the entire utility.
[02:40.720 --> 02:43.800]  So the idea of selling a super-premium version of it
[02:43.800 --> 02:46.320]  is bananas to me, but I'm sure Apple knows.
[02:46.320 --> 02:48.140]  Well, no, I don't know that Apple knows what they're doing,
[02:48.140 --> 02:50.140]  but presumably there is a market for that.
[02:50.140 --> 02:53.440]  I think that people, I think your take is very typical,
[02:53.440 --> 02:55.480]  and you're obviously juiced in more to this
[02:55.480 --> 02:58.520]  than the average person out there.
[02:59.760 --> 03:03.120]  For most people, getting a $300 digital watch
[03:03.120 --> 03:05.740]  is a pretty expensive digital watch,
[03:05.740 --> 03:07.840]  and that is what it is, right?
[03:07.840 --> 03:11.400]  It is, I mean, we can get into nerd out,
[03:11.400 --> 03:13.300]  and you're running apps, and you're doing all this stuff,
[03:13.300 --> 03:17.260]  but it's a digital watch, and 300 bucks is more
[03:17.260 --> 03:20.140]  than most people spend on a watch, and if they do get one,
[03:20.140 --> 03:23.880]  they're gonna wear it forever, you know, by some definition
[03:23.880 --> 03:26.720]  of forever, which is less than a watch,
[03:26.720 --> 03:30.920]  you know, a super-watch, mechanical watch nerd's definition
[03:30.920 --> 03:34.480]  of forever, which is like decades, but way, way more
[03:34.480 --> 03:36.080]  than like a tech person would think.
[03:36.080 --> 03:39.920]  Hey, that's not the latest version.
[03:39.920 --> 03:43.520]  Yeah, the last time I spent a lot of time thinking about
[03:43.520 --> 03:45.800]  is when they introduced wireless, because I thought
[03:45.800 --> 03:47.840]  that was pretty interesting, and we finally got
[03:47.840 --> 03:50.840]  the sort of Dick Tracy land, and what if this thing
[03:50.840 --> 03:53.560]  would allow me to not take my phone with me
[03:53.560 --> 03:56.380]  on veritive, you know, when I went out,
[03:56.380 --> 03:59.880]  and I borrowed a watch from Apple using that premise,
[03:59.880 --> 04:02.400]  and Apple, to their credit, pretty much said,
[04:02.400 --> 04:04.840]  the thing you wanna do is not gonna work.
[04:04.840 --> 04:09.840]  You cannot use this as a phone substitute,
[04:09.940 --> 04:12.900]  and they're right, but when you tell people that,
[04:12.900 --> 04:15.240]  they get ashen-faced, they're like, well,
[04:15.240 --> 04:16.080]  what's the point of that?
[04:16.080 --> 04:17.180]  I'm like, I don't know.
[04:17.180 --> 04:21.120]  Yeah, I wonder, too, and I do have it.
[04:21.120 --> 04:24.360]  I have the, I bought a new one for myself last year,
[04:24.360 --> 04:25.900]  because I hadn't had one in a couple years,
[04:25.900 --> 04:29.480]  and I did get the cellular option, and I just justify
[04:29.480 --> 04:32.320]  it all as, well, you know, I write during Fireball,
[04:32.320 --> 04:36.400]  I should have the cellular thing, and I can, you know,
[04:36.400 --> 04:40.720]  I pass off my whole singular, not singular, Verizon bill,
[04:40.720 --> 04:43.000]  you know, as a tax, you know, it's a business expense
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.440]  that I charge $10 a month to put my watch on.
[04:46.440 --> 04:50.620]  I almost never, ever use the cellular thing on my phone,
[04:50.620 --> 04:53.920]  or on my watch, but I will say this,
[04:53.920 --> 04:55.080]  and I'm not saying it's worth it,
[04:55.080 --> 04:58.120]  because I think Verizon charges me 10 bucks a month for it.
[04:58.120 --> 04:59.000]  It's at least.
[04:59.000 --> 05:00.240]  That sounds right, yeah.
[05:01.460 --> 05:04.760]  I will say this, there was one time, and I don't remember,
[05:04.760 --> 05:07.120]  I'm not trying to like obfuscate a personal detail.
[05:07.120 --> 05:09.820]  I forget what it was, but like, at some point,
[05:10.920 --> 05:14.120]  a couple months ago, but I know it was during the quarantine,
[05:14.120 --> 05:16.520]  because I've sort of got like quarantine time locked
[05:16.520 --> 05:20.660]  in my head, there was like a minor iOS update, you know,
[05:20.660 --> 05:25.160]  just, you know, 13.1 points, whatever,
[05:25.160 --> 05:26.920]  and I'm like, okay, I'll update my phone,
[05:26.920 --> 05:31.040]  and it was like noon, and I got, while my phone was
[05:31.040 --> 05:33.940]  updating, I got a call I had been waiting for,
[05:33.940 --> 05:36.460]  I forget what it was, but it was a fairly important call
[05:36.460 --> 05:38.960]  from somebody who I was waiting to call me,
[05:38.960 --> 05:43.240]  and so I was really, and my, it went off on my wrist,
[05:43.240 --> 05:44.620]  and I was like, whoa, what's going on?
[05:44.620 --> 05:47.080]  And I look, and my phone has got that Apple logo
[05:47.080 --> 05:49.300]  that like, it takes like five, you don't even know
[05:49.300 --> 05:51.200]  how long it's gonna take till your phone's updated,
[05:51.200 --> 05:53.200]  and I'm like, oh, I can answer on my wrist,
[05:53.200 --> 05:57.200]  and I took the entire important phone call on my watch
[05:57.200 --> 06:02.200]  while my phone was incapacitated, and I was like,
[06:02.960 --> 06:06.960]  I don't know if this is worth $120 a year, but almost.
[06:06.960 --> 06:09.700]  It works, it works remarkably well as a speakerphone,
[06:09.700 --> 06:10.540]  I will say that.
[06:10.540 --> 06:12.520]  It's way better than you would expect that to work,
[06:12.520 --> 06:14.480]  but what I wanted was something that allowed me
[06:14.480 --> 06:17.160]  to go to my kid's soccer game, and if I needed
[06:17.160 --> 06:20.160]  to see an email or see a text or reply to one,
[06:20.160 --> 06:21.960]  that I could do that and not bring my phone,
[06:21.960 --> 06:24.120]  and then thus, I wouldn't be looking at my phone,
[06:24.120 --> 06:26.080]  or I'd be more in tune to my kids,
[06:26.080 --> 06:28.380]  and even as you say this out loud, you're saying,
[06:28.380 --> 06:30.800]  wait, you're gonna spend several hundred dollars
[06:30.800 --> 06:35.640]  plus $10 a month so you could not look at your phone?
[06:35.640 --> 06:37.120]  Why don't you just not look at your phone?
[06:37.120 --> 06:38.720]  And of course, if you're listening to this podcast,
[06:38.720 --> 06:40.640]  you know that's very hard, and it sounds pathetic
[06:40.640 --> 06:43.240]  to say that, but it doesn't allow you to do that.
[06:43.240 --> 06:45.840]  Mail won't work, text will kind of work
[06:45.840 --> 06:49.760]  if it's iMessage, but not, like the Apple people said,
[06:49.760 --> 06:52.240]  it doesn't do what you want it to do in that case.
[06:52.240 --> 06:53.660]  No, it definitely does not.
[06:56.360 --> 07:00.440]  The other thing is, and this is the interesting thing
[07:00.440 --> 07:03.200]  that they announced yesterday, was this sort of
[07:05.380 --> 07:08.680]  cellular watches for your young children
[07:08.680 --> 07:12.080]  and for your elderly, confused parents.
[07:14.480 --> 07:19.480]  I don't know, it's like I've got one kid
[07:19.720 --> 07:23.000]  and now he's in 11th grade, so I'm out of that,
[07:23.000 --> 07:26.800]  and he's got a phone.
[07:26.800 --> 07:31.200]  If you don't wanna buy a phone for your kid,
[07:31.200 --> 07:33.800]  which I get, and I totally, I'm not telling anybody
[07:33.800 --> 07:36.100]  how to parent their kids and what age should a kid
[07:36.100 --> 07:39.060]  get their own cell phone, is a huge question.
[07:39.060 --> 07:40.480]  It's like the parental question,
[07:40.480 --> 07:43.760]  one of the big parental questions of our generation.
[07:44.920 --> 07:47.040]  But if you're on the fence about it,
[07:47.040 --> 07:50.040]  whether it's expense-wise or whatever else,
[07:50.040 --> 07:53.480]  are you gonna buy your kid a $350 or $400 watch?
[07:54.800 --> 07:56.640]  Yeah, that baffled me as well.
[07:56.640 --> 07:57.700]  I thought the exact same thing,
[07:57.700 --> 07:59.700]  which my kids have a tracking device,
[07:59.700 --> 08:01.300]  it's the phone I bought for them.
[08:01.300 --> 08:05.260]  Or the phone, and buying that phone's a big deal,
[08:05.260 --> 08:07.360]  and I bought a used phone from Amazon,
[08:07.360 --> 08:09.880]  Amazon renewed, now I got battery problems and all that.
[08:09.880 --> 08:13.440]  But yeah, it's the tracking device is the phone.
[08:13.440 --> 08:14.280]  We don't need a second tracking device.
[08:14.280 --> 08:19.000]  And it's like if you're the kid who's like 11 or 12
[08:19.000 --> 08:22.840]  and your parents are willing to get you a $400 thing
[08:22.840 --> 08:25.420]  to add to the family's cell phone plan,
[08:25.420 --> 08:27.460]  don't you want the iPhone SE?
[08:27.460 --> 08:30.360]  Like, I want the phone, I want the thing I can play with
[08:30.360 --> 08:31.320]  and take pictures with.
[08:31.320 --> 08:33.520]  I kind of assume that everyone in that market
[08:33.520 --> 08:35.200]  has the phone too.
[08:35.200 --> 08:37.040]  That's what I imagine in Apple.
[08:37.040 --> 08:41.320]  Yeah, but they really sold that feature as like your kid.
[08:41.320 --> 08:42.840]  They didn't, and it's weird,
[08:42.840 --> 08:45.180]  because it's like Apple can't say
[08:45.180 --> 08:46.840]  if you don't want to get your kid a phone,
[08:46.840 --> 08:47.680]  because they're Apple,
[08:47.680 --> 08:50.400]  they want everybody to have a phone.
[08:50.400 --> 08:55.280]  So you had to, it was a weird sort of, not doublespeak,
[08:55.280 --> 08:56.920]  what's the opposite of doublespeak
[08:56.920 --> 08:58.380]  where you don't mention something?
[08:58.380 --> 08:59.920]  Like a conspicuous.
[08:59.920 --> 09:02.280]  You walk all the way up to it.
[09:02.280 --> 09:03.840]  The version of that that I really noticed
[09:03.840 --> 09:07.680]  was the blood oxygen reader,
[09:07.680 --> 09:09.960]  which I never would have thought
[09:09.960 --> 09:11.220]  prior to March of this year,
[09:11.220 --> 09:13.880]  but when you talk about blood oxygen levels,
[09:13.880 --> 09:16.760]  now you're like, oh, that's a COVID detector.
[09:16.760 --> 09:19.080]  But of course they can't say that, because it's not.
[09:19.080 --> 09:21.480]  And you'd have all kinds of liability problems.
[09:21.480 --> 09:23.680]  But I thought, I mean, I don't think there's anyone
[09:23.680 --> 09:26.480]  who saw that presentation and wasn't thinking about,
[09:26.480 --> 09:27.840]  will this tell me if I'm getting,
[09:27.840 --> 09:29.620]  or if I'm sick or getting sick?
[09:29.620 --> 09:32.640]  And they conspicuously did not say that out loud.
[09:32.640 --> 09:34.880]  Yeah, and it's, the other factor
[09:34.880 --> 09:36.720]  is that it's partially coincidental,
[09:36.720 --> 09:38.980]  because clearly these sort of sensors
[09:38.980 --> 09:40.640]  are years in the making,
[09:40.640 --> 09:44.840]  both in terms of just the components technically take years,
[09:44.840 --> 09:46.480]  and then with these watch things,
[09:46.480 --> 09:48.340]  they take even longer, I think,
[09:48.340 --> 09:49.920]  than most of Apple's technology,
[09:49.920 --> 09:52.040]  because they have to get FDA approval,
[09:52.040 --> 09:55.000]  and then the FDA equivalents around the world,
[09:55.000 --> 09:57.780]  you know, it's a regulatory nightmare.
[09:57.780 --> 10:00.360]  Right, it's not like one of these dropshipping people
[10:00.360 --> 10:03.520]  who came out with masks in the middle of March
[10:03.520 --> 10:07.160]  and said, this will help you, this will protect you.
[10:07.160 --> 10:08.320]  They weren't, it wasn't that,
[10:08.320 --> 10:11.120]  but it was still very clear that this was an application
[10:11.120 --> 10:12.120]  that you could use it for,
[10:12.120 --> 10:13.640]  but they weren't gonna suggest that out loud.
[10:13.640 --> 10:17.880]  Right, and it, there's just,
[10:17.880 --> 10:19.240]  but that's exactly what you said.
[10:19.240 --> 10:21.740]  Nobody's listening to this and not thinking that,
[10:21.740 --> 10:25.000]  because other than medical professionals,
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.300]  I don't know of anybody who hasn't heard
[10:27.300 --> 10:32.300]  blood oxygen as a term and thought about it
[10:32.360 --> 10:35.240]  more than in the last six months.
[10:35.240 --> 10:37.740]  I mean, I guess I've heard of it beforehand,
[10:37.740 --> 10:40.660]  but I mean, 99% of the times it's ever come up
[10:40.660 --> 10:43.920]  in my awareness is COVID.
[10:43.920 --> 10:45.840]  Yep, yep.
[10:45.840 --> 10:46.960]  So it was in, you know,
[10:46.960 --> 10:50.440]  they have these off-the-record briefings
[10:50.440 --> 10:52.000]  for the media after events,
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.640]  and they're, you know, they're getting better at them.
[10:54.640 --> 10:56.400]  It was, you know, and it's off the record,
[10:56.400 --> 10:59.000]  so I can't really spill the details of it,
[10:59.000 --> 11:01.240]  but people did ask, you know,
[11:01.240 --> 11:02.920]  and it's like they can't say it.
[11:02.920 --> 11:05.400]  It's, you know, it's more than the typical
[11:05.400 --> 11:08.440]  Apple not wanting to say, get knocked off message.
[11:08.440 --> 11:11.360]  They just legally can't talk about it in that context.
[11:11.360 --> 11:13.260]  Yes, that's right.
[11:13.260 --> 11:14.100]  Yeah.
[11:15.040 --> 11:18.960]  As by the way, they should be very reticent
[11:18.960 --> 11:22.040]  to make medical claims, which is, I mean, again,
[11:22.040 --> 11:24.000]  and I don't follow the watch stuff carefully,
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.180]  but I do know as a watch user
[11:26.180 --> 11:28.280]  that, you know, when I'm sitting on the subway
[11:28.280 --> 11:30.640]  and I'm traveling under the East River
[11:30.640 --> 11:32.000]  and all of a sudden the watch tells me
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.500]  that I've passed my movement goal for the day
[11:34.500 --> 11:36.580]  or my standing goal for the day,
[11:36.580 --> 11:38.780]  I get a chuckle and I go, oh, you know, it's harmless.
[11:38.780 --> 11:40.400]  It doesn't really matter to me one way or the other,
[11:40.400 --> 11:43.180]  but I do think about sort of people
[11:43.180 --> 11:44.920]  who are relying on these devices
[11:44.920 --> 11:46.960]  for actual medical information
[11:46.960 --> 11:49.960]  and because, you know, Apple half positions this now
[11:49.960 --> 11:52.000]  as a, they no longer say it's, you know, for work, right?
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.580]  It's for health and fitness.
[11:54.580 --> 11:55.960]  And the fitness part I sort of get,
[11:55.960 --> 11:57.640]  and there's people who really,
[11:57.640 --> 12:00.160]  it really does matter to them how many miles they clock
[12:00.160 --> 12:02.680]  and how many minutes, but for most people,
[12:02.680 --> 12:04.120]  I think are probably more in my group, right?
[12:04.120 --> 12:07.520]  It's casual, but the medical stuff really unnerved,
[12:07.520 --> 12:10.220]  would unnerve me if I was Apple
[12:10.220 --> 12:13.780]  and had people relying on me for medical information.
[12:14.920 --> 12:18.200]  Yeah, I wouldn't, and I'll defer to actual experts on that,
[12:18.200 --> 12:19.520]  but I do think about that a lot
[12:19.520 --> 12:21.040]  because it's clearly a device
[12:21.040 --> 12:23.120]  that has a limit on its accuracy,
[12:23.120 --> 12:24.480]  which is fine in most cases.
[12:24.480 --> 12:27.720]  And I kind of feel like, you know,
[12:27.720 --> 12:32.400]  he's such a bizarro second version of Tim Cook,
[12:32.400 --> 12:35.400]  but that Jeff Williams being in charge of the watch
[12:35.400 --> 12:37.720]  is sort of unsurprising.
[12:37.720 --> 12:42.320]  Like, he's clearly a bit of a cipher personality-wise,
[12:42.320 --> 12:46.560]  but he definitely seems like the,
[12:46.560 --> 12:50.920]  you know, the old carpenter saying measure twice, cut once.
[12:50.920 --> 12:52.100]  Tim Cook and Jeff Williams
[12:52.100 --> 12:56.400]  seem like measure 100 times, cut once type of people.
[12:56.400 --> 12:59.200]  Yeah, they're not freelancing a lot at these things.
[12:59.200 --> 13:00.400]  Right, and so on the one hand,
[13:00.400 --> 13:03.280]  they definitely are clearly incentivized
[13:03.280 --> 13:04.380]  to sell a lot of watches,
[13:04.380 --> 13:06.540]  but neither of them really feel like,
[13:06.540 --> 13:09.320]  well, let's cut some corners and make some bold claims
[13:09.320 --> 13:12.400]  on the medical efficacy of these sensors.
[13:12.400 --> 13:13.880]  You know, they seem to be doing
[13:13.880 --> 13:16.200]  a pretty good job on that stuff.
[13:16.200 --> 13:18.280]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, they're not telling you,
[13:18.280 --> 13:20.440]  they're not misleading you.
[13:20.440 --> 13:21.760]  But on the other hand, they are saying
[13:21.760 --> 13:23.080]  these things have benefits,
[13:23.080 --> 13:24.900]  and these can help you track your health,
[13:24.900 --> 13:26.640]  and I think there's a,
[13:26.640 --> 13:28.640]  for me, there's an uncomfortable middle ground there.
[13:28.640 --> 13:31.000]  The bigger one to me, and they spent less time on it,
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.560]  like they showed kids, but the bigger one to me
[13:34.560 --> 13:39.520]  is the question of getting it for your, quote, older parents.
[13:39.520 --> 13:44.520]  That seems to me the, and I forget if it was a year ago
[13:45.120 --> 13:47.800]  or two years ago when they added fall detection,
[13:47.800 --> 13:50.720]  and they keep showing people on mountain bikes
[13:50.720 --> 13:52.740]  and making jokes about a guy yesterday
[13:52.740 --> 13:54.920]  getting chased off a cliff by a bear,
[13:54.920 --> 13:57.080]  and that's real, and I know in California,
[13:57.080 --> 13:58.640]  the mountain biking thing is real,
[13:58.640 --> 14:01.640]  and the mountains are, you know, real mountains,
[14:01.640 --> 14:03.800]  not our East Coast mountains.
[14:05.300 --> 14:06.140]  But they.
[14:06.140 --> 14:06.980]  They also embarrass.
[14:06.980 --> 14:11.400]  Yeah, but they also danced around that
[14:11.400 --> 14:12.780]  when they introduced it too,
[14:12.780 --> 14:16.600]  where they did show like a grandmother type
[14:16.600 --> 14:19.280]  in a kitchen on a stool, and then there was a little,
[14:19.280 --> 14:20.960]  you know, she was like watching her grandkid
[14:20.960 --> 14:24.560]  who was running in, and then they definitely cut away,
[14:24.560 --> 14:27.380]  and then all of the actual simulations
[14:27.380 --> 14:31.520]  of an adult falling in the home weren't photographed.
[14:31.520 --> 14:33.760]  They were pictograms, you know,
[14:33.760 --> 14:37.200]  like the Olympic-style stick figures of somebody,
[14:37.200 --> 14:40.720]  and I remember talking to Apple, people at Apple about it,
[14:40.720 --> 14:41.880]  like that was pretty, and they were like,
[14:41.880 --> 14:44.360]  yeah, we were, you know, we really had to be careful
[14:44.360 --> 14:46.880]  because we wanted people to know that it is good for this,
[14:46.880 --> 14:50.480]  and we actually designed it with like older people in mind
[14:50.480 --> 14:53.360]  so that when they, you know, that their type of falls
[14:53.360 --> 14:56.400]  are going to be less violent,
[14:56.400 --> 14:58.920]  and we really wanna be in tune to it,
[14:58.920 --> 15:01.160]  but we can't show it, you know, it's, you know,
[15:01.160 --> 15:04.520]  it's grotesque, you can't just show an old person
[15:04.520 --> 15:07.960]  falling off a stool in an Apple event, it's, it.
[15:07.960 --> 15:09.840]  Well, you're not in an Apple event,
[15:09.840 --> 15:12.320]  but it has been done before, but here's my question,
[15:12.320 --> 15:13.840]  I think we're roughly the same age,
[15:13.840 --> 15:16.680]  is the clapper and iPhone, and I can't get up,
[15:16.680 --> 15:18.040]  is that the same thing?
[15:19.000 --> 15:20.840]  Okay, yeah, that's what I thought.
[15:20.840 --> 15:23.160]  No, I think I've fallen and I can't get up
[15:23.160 --> 15:26.000]  was the medic alert, remember that?
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.080]  It was a, it was a, it was a.
[15:28.080 --> 15:31.080]  You're right, but that did show the older people
[15:31.080 --> 15:34.760]  on the ground yelling for help, and it's,
[15:34.760 --> 15:36.820]  I would say it's burned indelibly in our minds,
[15:36.820 --> 15:39.140]  but of course I just, I'm confused about which brand it was,
[15:39.140 --> 15:40.640]  but yeah, if you were a certain age
[15:40.640 --> 15:41.840]  and you watched a certain kind of TV,
[15:41.840 --> 15:42.680]  you saw a lot of those ads.
[15:42.680 --> 15:45.840]  Right, and as media junkies, you and I saw all of them,
[15:45.840 --> 15:47.200]  right, because what was the other one?
[15:47.200 --> 15:48.600]  There was another one where the old lady,
[15:48.600 --> 15:50.820]  there was a burglar outside her window.
[15:52.040 --> 15:53.840]  Do you remember?
[15:53.840 --> 15:55.920]  No, I don't remember that, I remember the rascal
[15:55.920 --> 15:59.640]  that would take you up the stairs, and then the clapper,
[15:59.640 --> 16:01.200]  and they all seemed to be sort of aimed
[16:01.200 --> 16:03.000]  at the exact same target.
[16:03.000 --> 16:04.520]  I think it might have been the same product
[16:04.520 --> 16:06.960]  as the I've fallen and I can't get up, the medic alert,
[16:06.960 --> 16:09.480]  but it was, in addition to falling,
[16:09.480 --> 16:12.480]  there was a burglar outside an old lady's window,
[16:12.480 --> 16:15.860]  conveniently on the ground floor,
[16:15.860 --> 16:19.860]  and he was making faces at her through the window
[16:19.860 --> 16:23.260]  to show that he was about to come in and burglarize.
[16:23.260 --> 16:25.300]  You know, the most alarming passage in time
[16:25.300 --> 16:27.540]  is when you go from laughing at those ads
[16:27.540 --> 16:30.380]  that are aimed at old people to gradually getting closer
[16:30.380 --> 16:31.860]  and closer to the target market.
[16:31.860 --> 16:33.660]  It's definitely happened to me with pharma stuff.
[16:33.660 --> 16:34.500]  Yeah, totally.
[16:34.500 --> 16:37.340]  Those pharma ads that run during football or 60 Minutes
[16:37.340 --> 16:38.860]  I never paid any attention to,
[16:38.860 --> 16:41.080]  and I'm still not really the market for it yet,
[16:41.080 --> 16:42.740]  but I'm definitely getting closer,
[16:42.740 --> 16:44.940]  and I keep thinking, all right, one day,
[16:44.940 --> 16:47.860]  I'm gonna pay a lot of attention to that small type.
[16:47.860 --> 16:50.820]  Yeah, I think what happens with that, with the sports,
[16:50.820 --> 16:53.820]  is you run out of, I'm 47,
[16:53.820 --> 16:58.820]  so I've run out of athletes who are my age.
[16:58.980 --> 17:01.580]  It was, as a Yankees fan, one of the nice things
[17:01.580 --> 17:05.040]  about being a Yankees fan of my age
[17:05.040 --> 17:08.500]  is that Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera had,
[17:08.500 --> 17:11.700]  in addition to extremely successful careers,
[17:11.700 --> 17:15.340]  played until they were like 41, 42 years old,
[17:15.340 --> 17:17.060]  and they were roughly my age,
[17:17.060 --> 17:20.340]  and so I still had guys, my guys, my age,
[17:20.340 --> 17:22.180]  playing professional sports.
[17:22.180 --> 17:24.220]  Now I'm 47, nobody's left.
[17:24.220 --> 17:26.980]  Tom Brady is, I don't know, a remarkable 43
[17:26.980 --> 17:29.500]  and still playing an NFL quarterback, but.
[17:29.500 --> 17:31.580]  And perhaps washed up, yeah.
[17:31.580 --> 17:34.180]  Yeah, Kickers, I think, is our last chance
[17:34.180 --> 17:36.620]  to find someone, Morton Anderson or someone like,
[17:36.620 --> 17:38.380]  oh my God, we're so old.
[17:38.380 --> 17:39.940]  And every once in a while,
[17:39.940 --> 17:41.660]  there'd be a baseball pitcher who could pitch
[17:41.660 --> 17:44.220]  until his 40s, because he was a knuckleball thrower
[17:44.220 --> 17:45.420]  or something like that.
[17:45.420 --> 17:48.780]  Phil Necro, I remember being very old, yeah, yeah.
[17:48.780 --> 17:50.740]  This has been Old Timey Radio brought to you
[17:50.740 --> 17:51.580]  by John Deere.
[17:51.580 --> 17:55.540]  Well, but what happens is you go from having
[17:55.540 --> 17:59.140]  the last gasp of athletes your age
[17:59.140 --> 18:02.140]  to suddenly watching the commercials between there,
[18:02.140 --> 18:05.860]  and it's clearly a product for an older gentleman,
[18:05.860 --> 18:06.920]  and you're like, wait a minute,
[18:06.920 --> 18:08.720]  that actor looks younger than me.
[18:10.580 --> 18:13.580]  Whatever is, whatever the medical problem
[18:13.580 --> 18:15.620]  that's ailing him that you tend to think of
[18:15.620 --> 18:17.660]  as being a generation older than you,
[18:17.660 --> 18:19.880]  all of a sudden I'm looking at the casting,
[18:19.880 --> 18:22.760]  and I'm like, well, he's a professional actor,
[18:22.760 --> 18:24.580]  but damn, he looks.
[18:24.580 --> 18:27.140]  A handsome fellow, yes, yeah.
[18:27.140 --> 18:28.940]  I got an Instagram ad inviting me
[18:28.940 --> 18:32.640]  to join a COVID vaccine test, I think it was Pfizer,
[18:32.640 --> 18:34.240]  and it's clearly one of those things
[18:34.240 --> 18:36.620]  where they are A, B testing different images
[18:36.620 --> 18:37.780]  and targeting different people,
[18:37.780 --> 18:41.360]  and the gentleman in my Instagram ad was,
[18:41.360 --> 18:44.500]  I'm guessing, at least 10 years older than me,
[18:44.500 --> 18:46.580]  but it was gnarly to realize that they had pegged me
[18:46.580 --> 18:48.900]  as someone in that general bracket
[18:49.960 --> 18:51.760]  who might be interested in getting COVID testing
[18:51.760 --> 18:54.200]  through an Instagram ad, which is a whole other story.
[18:54.200 --> 18:56.580]  Instagram, people ask me, I keep saying this,
[18:56.580 --> 18:58.540]  people ask me like, hey, you're a Facebook critic,
[18:58.540 --> 19:00.400]  why do you still have Instagram?
[19:00.400 --> 19:04.740]  And it's like, partially because I've got friends
[19:04.740 --> 19:07.520]  on Instagram, and I'm hooked, I get it,
[19:07.520 --> 19:10.780]  that I do like all the other craziness,
[19:10.780 --> 19:13.760]  but professionally, I'm obsessed
[19:13.760 --> 19:15.700]  with the accuracy of their ads.
[19:16.720 --> 19:17.800]  It is.
[19:17.800 --> 19:19.680]  Yeah, no, I just went through this with someone who said,
[19:19.680 --> 19:22.240]  I'm quitting Facebook because of this latest outrage,
[19:22.240 --> 19:25.360]  and meet me over on Instagram,
[19:25.360 --> 19:27.680]  and I gently pointed out, and she knew,
[19:27.680 --> 19:29.080]  she knew that they were owned by the same thing.
[19:29.080 --> 19:32.160]  She said, yeah, I know, I just can't tolerate Facebook,
[19:32.160 --> 19:34.920]  and this is the compromise I'm making in my head,
[19:34.920 --> 19:36.160]  but I can't give up Instagram.
[19:36.160 --> 19:38.960]  The bizarre accuracy of their ads
[19:39.880 --> 19:41.920]  is like passing a street performer
[19:41.920 --> 19:43.800]  who's good at sleight of hand magic,
[19:43.800 --> 19:47.440]  and it's like, sometimes you see the same trick,
[19:47.440 --> 19:50.040]  it's like, okay, you got me, I like old watches,
[19:50.040 --> 19:52.320]  so yeah, yeah, here's another vintage,
[19:52.320 --> 19:55.880]  either vintage-style watch or something, you know,
[19:55.880 --> 19:57.480]  all right, but then they'll show me an ad
[19:57.480 --> 20:02.480]  for something else, and I'm like, wait, how did you know?
[20:02.600 --> 20:05.360]  The savviest people I know, people who are in tech,
[20:05.360 --> 20:07.420]  people who write about tech, will continue to tell me
[20:07.420 --> 20:10.400]  that Instagram or Facebook must be listening to them,
[20:10.400 --> 20:11.840]  and that's how they do the ad targeting,
[20:11.840 --> 20:14.480]  and then you explain it, that can't be possible,
[20:15.800 --> 20:18.360]  and they refuse to believe you, because it's too eerie,
[20:18.360 --> 20:20.760]  and the sad reality, right, is a lot of,
[20:20.760 --> 20:23.640]  is very, we're much less interesting than we think we are,
[20:23.640 --> 20:25.840]  and there's much bigger pools of people who look like
[20:25.840 --> 20:27.680]  and act like us than we realize or want to observe.
[20:27.680 --> 20:32.400]  Yeah, as a, I'm not a hobbyist sleight of hand magician,
[20:32.400 --> 20:37.020]  but I am a big devotee of just observing it,
[20:37.020 --> 20:40.020]  and that's exactly how sleight of hand magic works,
[20:40.020 --> 20:43.240]  at a very macro level, everybody's guess,
[20:43.240 --> 20:46.340]  well, they must be blank, and that's never it, right,
[20:46.340 --> 20:48.860]  that's never the explanation for the trick,
[20:48.860 --> 20:51.480]  but if you ever do get the explanation for a trick,
[20:51.480 --> 20:54.320]  it is always so mundane, it is like, what, really?
[20:54.320 --> 20:55.880]  That's how you do that?
[20:55.880 --> 20:57.680]  Yeah, that's it.
[20:57.680 --> 20:59.880]  Yeah, you just scoop the coin into your lap, that's it,
[20:59.880 --> 21:04.880]  you know, and the, oh, no, they must be blank,
[21:05.760 --> 21:08.480]  is like the equivalent of they must be listening to us,
[21:08.480 --> 21:11.020]  and it's like, nope, that's not it.
[21:11.020 --> 21:12.840]  Are you a Ricky J fan?
[21:12.840 --> 21:13.760]  Oh, the biggest.
[21:14.800 --> 21:17.780]  Okay, I figured, I figured, I love it, too.
[21:17.780 --> 21:19.920]  Great, and a great New Yorker profile of him
[21:19.920 --> 21:20.760]  from years ago, have you done that?
[21:20.760 --> 21:22.880]  Oh, I have, I've read all of it.
[21:22.880 --> 21:27.120]  When he died, I went back and watched all of it,
[21:27.120 --> 21:29.800]  and there's like YouTubes that are like,
[21:29.800 --> 21:32.880]  I don't even know what's under 480p,
[21:32.880 --> 21:37.880]  but some of his old VHS stuff is really, really low res,
[21:38.360 --> 21:42.160]  and even there, it's like amazing, I love Ricky J.
[21:42.160 --> 21:43.500]  Also, what a great character.
[21:43.500 --> 21:44.960]  What a great character.
[21:44.960 --> 21:46.560]  So great, so he'll go in your show notes.
[21:46.560 --> 21:47.400]  Yeah.
[21:47.400 --> 21:49.840]  And I feel like I've contributed, I'm good.
[21:49.840 --> 21:53.280]  Here, let me take a break and thank our first sponsor
[21:53.280 --> 21:56.840]  of the show are my good friends at Linode, L-I-N-O-D-E.
[21:56.840 --> 21:58.320]  I used to pronounce them Linode,
[21:58.320 --> 22:01.360]  but it's Linode like Linux, because it's Linux hosting.
[22:01.360 --> 22:03.160]  That's where I host during Fireball.
[22:03.160 --> 22:04.460]  Could not be happier with them.
[22:04.460 --> 22:08.800]  They are a phenomenal, phenomenal hosting service
[22:08.800 --> 22:12.260]  with great customer support and amazing prices,
[22:12.260 --> 22:13.140]  quite frankly.
[22:14.480 --> 22:17.500]  They have a code, talkshow20,
[22:17.500 --> 22:19.080]  and when you create a new Linode account,
[22:19.080 --> 22:21.720]  you get $20 credit towards your next project,
[22:21.720 --> 22:23.480]  which can go a lot further than you think.
[22:23.480 --> 22:26.240]  They have 11 data centers worldwide,
[22:26.240 --> 22:28.040]  which matters for a lot of uses.
[22:28.040 --> 22:29.800]  If you need a data center close to you,
[22:29.800 --> 22:33.840]  or perhaps for legal compliance reasons in your country,
[22:33.840 --> 22:37.840]  starting this year, they have a new object storage
[22:37.840 --> 22:40.520]  bucket system that is S3 compatible.
[22:40.520 --> 22:44.720]  Basically, if you have something that uses Amazon S3,
[22:44.720 --> 22:46.980]  you can just plug and play connect your code
[22:46.980 --> 22:48.760]  to use this instead.
[22:48.760 --> 22:49.940]  It is fantastic.
[22:49.940 --> 22:52.040]  They also have one-click installs
[22:52.040 --> 22:54.200]  of all the popular stuff you might wanna host yourself.
[22:54.200 --> 22:57.120]  WordPress, game servers from Minecraft,
[22:57.120 --> 22:58.920]  big, big, big, every time I mention that
[22:58.920 --> 23:00.920]  when I do these reads for Linode,
[23:00.920 --> 23:03.320]  people write and say, yeah, they got one for their kid,
[23:03.320 --> 23:05.980]  and it has made them like the most popular parent
[23:05.980 --> 23:08.880]  in the grade, great, great use of this.
[23:08.880 --> 23:11.760]  Native SSD storage, they have a 40 gigabyte network
[23:11.760 --> 23:14.200]  at every one of their data centers.
[23:14.200 --> 23:15.540]  Just great stuff.
[23:15.540 --> 23:18.640]  They're also hiring, linode.com slash careers,
[23:18.640 --> 23:20.000]  to find out more.
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.800]  If you are even vaguely thinking that you should work
[23:22.800 --> 23:24.460]  for a professional web hosting service,
[23:24.460 --> 23:26.600]  you know the type of jobs they have, go check it out.
[23:26.600 --> 23:27.660]  It's a great company.
[23:29.160 --> 23:32.680]  And that $20 credit, they have nanoed plans
[23:32.680 --> 23:34.120]  that are just five bucks a month,
[23:34.120 --> 23:37.240]  so you can get a great plan, super useful.
[23:37.240 --> 23:39.820]  With the $20 credit, you get four months free.
[23:39.820 --> 23:41.960]  Unbelievable deal, still going on.
[23:41.960 --> 23:45.960]  Talk show 20 is the code, and go to linode,
[23:45.960 --> 23:50.360]  linode.com slash the talk show,
[23:50.360 --> 23:52.600]  linode.com slash the talk show,
[23:52.600 --> 23:54.960]  to get started and find out more.
[23:54.960 --> 23:57.460]  My thanks to them, not just for sponsoring the show,
[23:57.460 --> 23:58.960]  but for keeping my website up.
[24:00.240 --> 24:03.400]  So I've got the new watch that came this morning,
[24:03.400 --> 24:06.340]  which was kind of an unbelievable story.
[24:07.460 --> 24:09.820]  So I don't know, you didn't follow real closely.
[24:09.820 --> 24:11.320]  You know, they've got these new,
[24:11.320 --> 24:14.160]  they call them solo loop bands.
[24:14.160 --> 24:17.620]  So they're, yeah, it looked like the loop
[24:17.620 --> 24:19.340]  that I have on my series three,
[24:19.340 --> 24:20.720]  there's the basic one. At a glance,
[24:20.720 --> 24:23.020]  it looks exactly like the Apple Watch straps
[24:23.020 --> 24:24.480]  most people have, the rubber ones,
[24:24.480 --> 24:27.980]  but there's no, there is no clasp.
[24:27.980 --> 24:30.480]  They just stretch, and they are very,
[24:30.480 --> 24:32.640]  And is it one size fits all,
[24:32.640 --> 24:33.480]  and then you sort of stretch into it?
[24:33.480 --> 24:35.920]  Nope, it is, this is the part
[24:35.920 --> 24:37.540]  that I cannot stop thinking about,
[24:37.540 --> 24:39.000]  and I don't know what to do,
[24:39.000 --> 24:42.840]  because again, it seems like I'm the victim
[24:42.840 --> 24:44.120]  of a sleight of hand magic trick.
[24:44.120 --> 24:48.880]  They have 12 sizes, nine, so there's nine each.
[24:48.880 --> 24:50.320]  You know, there's like the larger watch
[24:50.320 --> 24:52.780]  and the smaller watch, roughly men's, women's,
[24:52.780 --> 24:56.040]  but I know a lot of men who have the 40 millimeter one.
[24:57.280 --> 24:58.760]  For each one, there's nine.
[24:58.760 --> 25:00.560]  So like sizes one through nine,
[25:00.560 --> 25:02.840]  or for the 40 millimeter, smaller watches,
[25:02.840 --> 25:07.840]  and sizes four through 12 are for the 44 millimeter watches.
[25:08.640 --> 25:13.400]  And again, my take on this is that it's like buying shoes.
[25:13.400 --> 25:16.640]  It is meant for an in-person retail experience.
[25:16.640 --> 25:18.800]  Go into the store, they have a whole bunch.
[25:18.800 --> 25:21.560]  You find the one you like, fit this is great,
[25:21.560 --> 25:22.400]  and then you walk out.
[25:22.400 --> 25:24.300]  You can't do that in the COVID era.
[25:24.300 --> 25:26.440]  So they have this thing you print out, a PDF.
[25:26.440 --> 25:28.960]  You print it out, cut it out like you're in kindergarten.
[25:28.960 --> 25:31.200]  You wrap it around your wrist.
[25:31.200 --> 25:32.040]  Ah!
[25:32.040 --> 25:34.360]  But, and so I do this last night,
[25:34.360 --> 25:35.860]  and I didn't publish my post
[25:35.860 --> 25:37.760]  until after midnight on the East Coast,
[25:38.800 --> 25:41.000]  and I know that's not where they got it,
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.520]  because the package arrived at my house this morning
[25:43.520 --> 25:44.560]  at eight a.m.
[25:46.560 --> 25:50.560]  I took mine out, and mine is a size seven,
[25:50.560 --> 25:53.100]  according to their scale, one to 12,
[25:53.100 --> 25:57.420]  and closer to an eight than to a six,
[25:57.420 --> 25:58.640]  but definitely in the seven,
[25:58.640 --> 26:01.160]  and they're only about a centimeter difference,
[26:01.160 --> 26:02.620]  maybe even less than a centimeter.
[26:02.620 --> 26:04.660]  They're pretty fine-grained.
[26:04.660 --> 26:07.900]  They sent me two straps, a seven and an eight.
[26:07.900 --> 26:11.500]  How did they do this?
[26:11.500 --> 26:13.340]  Actually, they sent me four.
[26:13.340 --> 26:15.980]  They sent me the rubber one and the braided yarn one,
[26:15.980 --> 26:18.780]  but each of those they sent in the size seven and eight,
[26:20.140 --> 26:21.900]  and I wrote to Apple PR.
[26:21.900 --> 26:23.620]  I was like, I'm blown away by this.
[26:23.620 --> 26:24.700]  How did you know?
[26:24.700 --> 26:25.520]  And they were like,
[26:25.520 --> 26:28.380]  that's the magic of the Apple Watch team,
[26:28.380 --> 26:30.540]  and I'm like, that's not an answer.
[26:30.540 --> 26:33.480]  Like, they've got, I think it's like a carnival,
[26:33.480 --> 26:36.180]  you know, like guess your weight or guess your age.
[26:36.180 --> 26:37.160]  They have somebody.
[26:37.160 --> 26:40.140]  How much variance can there be in wrist size?
[26:41.500 --> 26:43.860]  You can be very skinny or very heavy, I guess,
[26:43.860 --> 26:46.780]  and then everyone else is kind of in the middle, right?
[26:46.780 --> 26:49.500]  But think about like the regular strap
[26:49.500 --> 26:52.580]  with the one you have with the pins, right?
[26:52.580 --> 26:54.860]  It's effectively like guessing exactly
[26:54.860 --> 26:56.780]  which pin size you take,
[26:56.780 --> 26:59.060]  you know, which hole your pin goes through,
[26:59.060 --> 27:00.800]  and so they sent me two, you know,
[27:00.800 --> 27:03.980]  but it's out of all those holes in your straps,
[27:03.980 --> 27:07.580]  and they got me the exact right size.
[27:07.580 --> 27:08.420]  It's unbelievable.
[27:08.420 --> 27:11.180]  Yeah, I bet you most people have the same hole
[27:11.180 --> 27:13.040]  on their strap, too.
[27:13.040 --> 27:14.280]  Maybe, I mean.
[27:14.280 --> 27:15.120]  Is my guess.
[27:15.120 --> 27:15.960]  I have to.
[27:15.960 --> 27:18.000]  In keeping with the carnival trick,
[27:18.000 --> 27:19.460]  like there's actually much less variance.
[27:19.460 --> 27:21.980]  Yeah, so what I need to do after we record
[27:21.980 --> 27:24.940]  is I gotta ping a couple of my friends in the racket,
[27:24.940 --> 27:27.740]  you know, like I'll ping like Joanna, Stern,
[27:27.740 --> 27:31.460]  and maybe Nilay, who obviously have very different wrists,
[27:31.460 --> 27:32.700]  and see if they got this,
[27:32.700 --> 27:34.940]  but they must, you know,
[27:34.940 --> 27:37.460]  they surely didn't send the same size to everybody,
[27:37.460 --> 27:38.940]  but, you know, did they guess
[27:38.940 --> 27:40.660]  that Nilay needed a thicker one?
[27:40.660 --> 27:42.620]  I don't know, but whoever's doing
[27:42.620 --> 27:45.180]  the carnival wrist size guessing for the Apple Watch team
[27:45.180 --> 27:47.540]  nailed me spot on.
[27:47.540 --> 27:48.500]  I love this strap.
[27:48.500 --> 27:50.900]  It is very, very nice and comfortable.
[27:52.100 --> 27:53.500]  Can I ask you something about that?
[27:53.500 --> 27:55.140]  Because like I said, I do wear the watch,
[27:55.140 --> 27:56.820]  and I have the, at one point,
[27:56.820 --> 27:58.660]  I went out and got the fancier straps
[27:58.660 --> 28:00.340]  and would take the, put them on and off
[28:00.340 --> 28:01.980]  if I was exercising, and then I realized
[28:01.980 --> 28:03.420]  I'm just gonna keep the one on,
[28:03.420 --> 28:06.300]  and that one, I don't wanna gross anybody out,
[28:06.300 --> 28:08.740]  but it gets a little gamey over time,
[28:08.740 --> 28:10.340]  and I have to sort of wash it down,
[28:10.340 --> 28:11.900]  and if I'm exercising with it,
[28:11.900 --> 28:13.220]  and I periodically am like,
[28:13.220 --> 28:15.220]  oh yeah, that thing needs a little wipe.
[28:17.260 --> 28:20.380]  How does that factor into a thing that you,
[28:21.300 --> 28:23.100]  I guess it's the same thing, right?
[28:23.100 --> 28:25.460]  A strap is a strap, and whether it's got a pin
[28:25.460 --> 28:28.180]  or a stretchy thing, it shouldn't matter.
[28:28.180 --> 28:30.180]  I was thinking about that as they talked about,
[28:30.180 --> 28:31.500]  the one band that's harder to move.
[28:31.500 --> 28:34.780]  Yeah, well, it still slides in and out just as easily.
[28:34.780 --> 28:36.300]  It's like you don't really disconnect it,
[28:36.300 --> 28:39.580]  but I think anything rubbery like that,
[28:39.580 --> 28:42.780]  you're gonna wanna wash with soap and water once in a while.
[28:42.780 --> 28:44.940]  And that's sort of, again,
[28:44.940 --> 28:46.860]  not to get into a watch nerd discussion,
[28:46.860 --> 28:48.220]  but it is sort of the problem
[28:48.220 --> 28:50.540]  with leather watch straps of all kinds,
[28:50.540 --> 28:53.380]  is they don't last, if you wear one,
[28:53.380 --> 28:55.340]  if you get a watch with a leather strap,
[28:55.340 --> 28:57.780]  it's not gonna last for years.
[28:57.780 --> 28:59.900]  It just falls apart.
[28:59.900 --> 29:01.980]  Yeah, but you want it to sort of have that weathered look.
[29:01.980 --> 29:04.020]  Yeah, but eventually it's sort of,
[29:04.020 --> 29:06.460]  it goes from looking like cool and weathered
[29:06.460 --> 29:11.060]  to looking like disgusting or maybe having a bit of a smell.
[29:12.460 --> 29:14.740]  And leather doesn't take to a soap and water
[29:14.740 --> 29:16.660]  as well as other materials.
[29:17.860 --> 29:20.060]  I'm grossed out, it's my wrist I'm talking about.
[29:20.060 --> 29:21.900]  But anyway, it is a very nice strap.
[29:21.900 --> 29:23.260]  I feel it'll be very popular.
[29:23.260 --> 29:27.460]  And I will say their cutout system nailed my size perfectly.
[29:27.460 --> 29:30.940]  The seven is the one that I thought from the paper cutout
[29:30.940 --> 29:32.660]  is exactly the most comfortable.
[29:32.660 --> 29:36.980]  The eight that Apple sent me as like a second best guess
[29:36.980 --> 29:40.580]  fits, but is a little loose for my taste.
[29:40.580 --> 29:42.940]  Like, and it feels like maybe somebody
[29:42.940 --> 29:46.460]  who likes a looser watch would prefer it,
[29:47.740 --> 29:49.340]  but it's really nice.
[29:49.340 --> 29:50.780]  And it's definitely lighter.
[29:50.780 --> 29:52.500]  I use my kitchen scale.
[29:52.500 --> 29:56.100]  The regular rubber straps, the sport bands they call them,
[29:56.100 --> 29:57.460]  are about 25 grams.
[29:57.460 --> 29:58.940]  This one's only 13 grams.
[29:58.940 --> 30:01.380]  So it's about half the weight.
[30:01.380 --> 30:02.540]  Feels like nothing on your wrist.
[30:02.540 --> 30:04.780]  Can I ask a meta question here for you?
[30:04.780 --> 30:05.620]  Of course.
[30:05.620 --> 30:10.620]  The one hour, two, 2.5 announcements to make.
[30:11.260 --> 30:14.340]  Do you prefer, and they no longer, right,
[30:14.340 --> 30:15.740]  they can have their announcements
[30:15.740 --> 30:16.940]  at whatever schedule they want
[30:16.940 --> 30:19.020]  and they don't need to bring press out there.
[30:19.020 --> 30:22.180]  Do you prefer sort of these discrete chunks of announcements
[30:22.180 --> 30:23.900]  versus sort of one mega announcement
[30:23.900 --> 30:25.220]  and here's six different things
[30:25.220 --> 30:26.700]  and we're doing it all in one day.
[30:26.700 --> 30:30.060]  Does it matter to you as a professional Apple observer?
[30:30.060 --> 30:33.300]  I prefer the smaller ones, personally.
[30:33.300 --> 30:34.300]  Yeah.
[30:34.300 --> 30:36.860]  I would, and over the years,
[30:39.780 --> 30:40.620]  I struggle.
[30:40.620 --> 30:43.420]  And part of it is my personal nature.
[30:43.420 --> 30:46.940]  Part of it is the, what I talked to you about on your show,
[30:46.940 --> 30:50.660]  is the weird sort of semi-unique nature
[30:50.660 --> 30:54.380]  of my media empire, which is me.
[30:54.380 --> 30:56.220]  And it makes it harder for me,
[30:56.220 --> 30:58.020]  but I'm also, personality-wise,
[30:58.020 --> 31:02.260]  just not as good at covering a shotgun approach.
[31:02.260 --> 31:03.980]  Like, here's 12 things, here's my thoughts.
[31:03.980 --> 31:07.780]  Like, I do much better with one thing to concentrate on,
[31:07.780 --> 31:11.380]  even if it's not something that's like my favorite thing.
[31:11.380 --> 31:12.220]  Yeah, that's what I figured.
[31:12.220 --> 31:13.300]  And again, since there's no travel,
[31:13.300 --> 31:14.340]  it's not like you have to complain
[31:14.340 --> 31:18.100]  about getting on a plane in September and October.
[31:18.100 --> 31:20.260]  Yeah, and the other problem, too,
[31:20.260 --> 31:25.260]  and I find dealing with Apple professionally in the media is,
[31:25.980 --> 31:27.140]  I feel like,
[31:29.740 --> 31:31.940]  in some ways, they're not that atypical,
[31:31.940 --> 31:33.500]  but they're always very Appley.
[31:33.500 --> 31:35.100]  And the one thing I always say to people,
[31:35.100 --> 31:36.980]  in all these years that I've been doing this,
[31:36.980 --> 31:40.700]  I have never once, in my opinion, been lied to by Apple.
[31:40.700 --> 31:43.940]  They've never said anything that I've thought was a lie,
[31:43.940 --> 31:46.340]  and I've never really felt like they screwed me
[31:46.340 --> 31:48.180]  on their response to something.
[31:48.180 --> 31:49.740]  If they don't wanna answer a question,
[31:49.740 --> 31:51.300]  they just don't answer it.
[31:51.300 --> 31:56.300]  Or more typically, they give you a very Appley non-answer
[31:56.500 --> 31:58.980]  that they acknowledge is a non-answer.
[31:58.980 --> 32:02.180]  And one of the things I miss about being in person
[32:02.180 --> 32:04.340]  is they'll give you a look that says,
[32:04.340 --> 32:05.740]  I know it's a non-answer,
[32:05.740 --> 32:08.420]  but in the words coming out of their mouth are a non-answer,
[32:08.420 --> 32:11.420]  but there's sort of a nod of the head
[32:11.420 --> 32:14.300]  that's like, you know, that's the best I'm gonna give you.
[32:16.780 --> 32:18.460]  Yeah, I think that is more common than not.
[32:18.460 --> 32:20.660]  Like, the people who are actually gonna lie to you,
[32:20.660 --> 32:23.660]  to your face, if they're professionals,
[32:23.660 --> 32:26.140]  they don't tend to last that long in the industry,
[32:26.140 --> 32:28.240]  and if it's a company, same problem.
[32:29.380 --> 32:31.500]  You can get away with it once or twice,
[32:32.740 --> 32:35.380]  but generally, it's not a good way.
[32:35.380 --> 32:37.380]  And everyone sort of accepts that a non-answer
[32:37.380 --> 32:39.380]  is a non-answer, and they understand why you're here.
[32:39.380 --> 32:40.820]  Well, there was a good story.
[32:40.820 --> 32:41.660]  I'm sure you saw it.
[32:41.660 --> 32:43.460]  There was a good story about a month ago.
[32:43.460 --> 32:45.500]  I think it was the Columbia Journalism Review
[32:45.500 --> 32:47.540]  had a story about dealing with Facebook,
[32:47.540 --> 32:50.220]  and that Facebook is sort of the exception to the rule
[32:50.220 --> 32:52.660]  where a lot of people in the media
[32:52.660 --> 32:55.920]  feel burned by Facebook PR, you know, that.
[32:57.180 --> 32:59.460]  Yeah, there was, you know,
[32:59.460 --> 33:01.300]  Casey Newton has an anecdote
[33:01.300 --> 33:03.180]  about being deceived about the plane,
[33:03.180 --> 33:05.500]  and to me, that seems like more of an outlier.
[33:05.500 --> 33:08.600]  I pretty much group Facebook in that same group
[33:08.600 --> 33:11.120]  of they might waste your time
[33:11.120 --> 33:12.880]  and not tell you things they wanna tell you,
[33:12.880 --> 33:15.940]  and hold press events and wish us very little to say,
[33:15.940 --> 33:19.620]  but I think they are less likely to lie to you,
[33:19.620 --> 33:21.180]  and I think that story has a lot more to do
[33:21.180 --> 33:25.960]  with sort of the change in the way people perceive Facebook
[33:25.960 --> 33:29.100]  and the kinds of questions they ask Facebook now
[33:29.100 --> 33:32.060]  as opposed to four or six years ago,
[33:32.060 --> 33:34.180]  and I think that's the difference,
[33:34.180 --> 33:36.340]  is you're asking much more serious questions
[33:36.340 --> 33:38.340]  about Facebook that are much more important
[33:38.340 --> 33:40.580]  than whether, you know, a plane is actually in the air
[33:40.580 --> 33:42.100]  or this widget does that.
[33:43.200 --> 33:44.340]  It has more consequence.
[33:44.340 --> 33:47.260]  I think, when I read that story,
[33:47.260 --> 33:49.620]  I don't think this is terribly dissimilar
[33:49.620 --> 33:50.580]  from a lot of other companies,
[33:50.580 --> 33:52.740]  but I think it was also shaded a bit.
[33:52.740 --> 33:57.740]  Well, the other factor is that Facebook PR,
[33:57.800 --> 33:59.820]  for all of Facebook's properties,
[34:01.580 --> 34:05.140]  it's just not the worst place to work, but the busiest,
[34:05.140 --> 34:08.580]  because they have the most PR issues to put out
[34:08.580 --> 34:10.860]  that aren't of their own doing, right?
[34:10.860 --> 34:15.380]  You can't go through a week without at least two stories
[34:15.380 --> 34:19.180]  about Facebook popping up that they kind of have to address
[34:19.180 --> 34:22.920]  in some way, you know, as a professional PR team,
[34:22.920 --> 34:25.480]  that aren't based on their announcements.
[34:25.480 --> 34:28.900]  They're about these constant fires that keep popping up.
[34:28.900 --> 34:30.640]  Right, that's what I'm getting at, right?
[34:30.640 --> 34:32.380]  It's one thing if you're Apple and you're generally
[34:32.380 --> 34:35.540]  just getting asked about the new whatever, right,
[34:35.540 --> 34:37.700]  and when is it coming out and what are the stats,
[34:37.700 --> 34:39.900]  and occasionally there's something unpleasant
[34:39.900 --> 34:42.260]  you have to discuss involving China or something,
[34:42.260 --> 34:43.900]  but usually it's not, right?
[34:43.900 --> 34:45.440]  And Facebook, now they're asking you about
[34:45.440 --> 34:49.180]  sort of like the existence and essence of Facebook,
[34:49.180 --> 34:51.600]  and are they responsible for this atrocity,
[34:51.600 --> 34:53.640]  and it's a very different set of questions.
[34:55.180 --> 34:58.100]  And I will say this, the one exception to the Apple PR
[34:58.100 --> 35:01.100]  doesn't say things that aren't true would be going back
[35:01.100 --> 35:04.420]  to when Steve Jobs' health was in decline,
[35:04.420 --> 35:07.180]  and there were some definite issues there
[35:07.180 --> 35:11.220]  where what they said in hindsight clearly wasn't true,
[35:11.220 --> 35:15.980]  and there was, and again, it's such a unique situation,
[35:15.980 --> 35:20.860]  and I was nowhere near in the position I am now
[35:20.860 --> 35:24.520]  when that happened, you know, around 2009, 2010.
[35:25.900 --> 35:28.540]  But you know, there was an issue.
[35:28.540 --> 35:30.480]  I remember a lot of that.
[35:30.480 --> 35:32.020]  I remember Henry Blodgett saying,
[35:32.020 --> 35:35.140]  Steve Jobs looks very sick on stage, what's going on?
[35:35.140 --> 35:36.780]  And they were indignant about it,
[35:36.780 --> 35:38.320]  and there were all kinds of variants of that.
[35:38.320 --> 35:39.940]  And I was gonna say the other exception to that
[35:39.940 --> 35:42.060]  is just Jobs in general, right?
[35:42.060 --> 35:43.060]  He was famous for saying,
[35:43.060 --> 35:46.000]  we're not gonna do the following and then do that.
[35:46.000 --> 35:47.300]  And that's, yeah.
[35:47.300 --> 35:50.260]  It was less Apple than Steve Jobs personally,
[35:50.260 --> 35:52.780]  deciding I'm not going to be forthcoming
[35:52.780 --> 35:53.980]  about what's going on.
[35:53.980 --> 35:55.280]  And it was like right before he took
[35:55.280 --> 35:58.620]  his first medical leave, and it was like, I don't know,
[35:58.620 --> 36:00.420]  it seems, or second medical leave,
[36:00.420 --> 36:02.540]  and it was like everybody knew he had had cancer before,
[36:02.540 --> 36:03.560]  and it's like, is it back?
[36:03.560 --> 36:06.300]  And it was like, no, yeah, I have a dietary issue
[36:06.300 --> 36:08.380]  or something, I forget what it was, but it was like.
[36:08.380 --> 36:12.020]  Yep, yep, yep, he had a cold, it was gaunt, and yeah, yeah.
[36:12.020 --> 36:15.700]  So I will just say that was a notable exception,
[36:15.700 --> 36:18.800]  but it was more like the exception that proved the rule
[36:18.800 --> 36:21.740]  than indicative of dealing with Apple
[36:21.740 --> 36:23.560]  and anything related to their products.
[36:23.560 --> 36:25.160]  It was all very, very personal.
[36:25.160 --> 36:27.180]  And I feel like there was, who at Apple
[36:27.180 --> 36:31.500]  was gonna stand up and say, you can't do this, you know?
[36:31.500 --> 36:33.660]  Yeah, I mean, since we're having the meta conversation,
[36:33.660 --> 36:35.500]  I mean, again, this probably seems obvious,
[36:35.500 --> 36:37.980]  but it has taken me quite a while to figure it out,
[36:37.980 --> 36:39.300]  is that everyone in the company
[36:39.300 --> 36:40.900]  takes the cue from their leader,
[36:40.900 --> 36:44.500]  and if you're upset about Facebook's PR or Apple's PR,
[36:44.500 --> 36:48.140]  whoever it is, they're doing what they think
[36:48.140 --> 36:50.020]  their boss wants them to do,
[36:50.020 --> 36:52.500]  and their boss usually does want them to do it,
[36:52.500 --> 36:53.520]  and if there's a disconnect,
[36:53.520 --> 36:55.620]  that usually gets solved one way or another.
[36:55.620 --> 36:57.900]  And so if you're upset with a certain way
[36:57.900 --> 37:00.460]  a company's treating you as a press person,
[37:00.460 --> 37:02.080]  that's what their CEO wants.
[37:02.080 --> 37:06.740]  Yeah, that's all I'll say now for the,
[37:06.740 --> 37:07.980]  getting back to the watch.
[37:07.980 --> 37:11.420]  I love it.
[37:11.420 --> 37:12.660]  I do like the strap.
[37:12.660 --> 37:13.480]  I think it's nice.
[37:13.480 --> 37:15.100]  I think people are gonna wanna try them on.
[37:15.100 --> 37:17.980]  I do think the paper thing is an accurate gauge,
[37:17.980 --> 37:19.740]  but that's really all I have to say for now.
[37:19.740 --> 37:21.540]  It's not a super exciting product.
[37:21.540 --> 37:24.960]  So I don't feel, to me, I'm most interested
[37:24.960 --> 37:27.540]  in those two minutes of the,
[37:27.540 --> 37:29.180]  this is why I wanted to talk to you this week,
[37:29.180 --> 37:32.540]  is to me, it's the bundle and the streaming
[37:33.620 --> 37:35.220]  and where this stuff is going.
[37:35.220 --> 37:36.060]  So what are your thoughts
[37:36.060 --> 37:39.100]  on the Apple One bundle that they announced?
[37:41.340 --> 37:44.900]  I am, I think it is,
[37:44.900 --> 37:47.740]  my mentions were flooded with people disagreeing with me,
[37:47.740 --> 37:48.580]  and that's their right,
[37:48.580 --> 37:50.820]  but I think it is an unimpressive bundle.
[37:50.820 --> 37:55.820]  I don't think it's meaningful for consumers or for Apple.
[37:56.100 --> 37:57.540]  My thought on bundles in general
[37:57.540 --> 37:59.500]  is they work when they are anchored
[37:59.500 --> 38:01.260]  by something that you really want.
[38:01.260 --> 38:03.200]  So if it's cable TV,
[38:03.200 --> 38:04.420]  you're paying for a bunch of channels
[38:04.420 --> 38:07.400]  because you want sports or live news or whatever it is.
[38:07.400 --> 38:09.460]  And Amazon Prime gives you a bunch of stuff,
[38:09.460 --> 38:11.860]  but you're not subscribing to Amazon Prime
[38:11.860 --> 38:13.500]  because you want Prime Video,
[38:13.500 --> 38:16.340]  you're subscribing because you want the free shipping.
[38:16.340 --> 38:20.480]  And I don't see the live sports
[38:20.480 --> 38:24.340]  or free shipping part of the Apple bundles.
[38:24.340 --> 38:25.900]  And so we can start there.
[38:25.900 --> 38:29.220]  But that to me is, it's not a meaningful thing
[38:29.220 --> 38:32.920]  until they connect it to the must-have Apple product,
[38:32.920 --> 38:33.980]  which is the device.
[38:33.980 --> 38:35.340]  And we can talk about why
[38:35.340 --> 38:38.060]  that maybe isn't the case right now.
[38:38.060 --> 38:41.700]  I guess my,
[38:43.540 --> 38:44.980]  I don't completely disagree,
[38:44.980 --> 38:47.300]  but I think I feel more like Apple Music
[38:47.300 --> 38:49.940]  is that linchpin service.
[38:49.940 --> 38:53.180]  And that is how, that's what I did to guess
[38:53.180 --> 38:54.300]  what their pricing would be,
[38:54.300 --> 38:56.200]  which was pretty accurate as I thought,
[38:56.200 --> 38:58.380]  well, why don't you take the Apple Music pricing
[38:58.380 --> 39:01.460]  and add $5 and there's your bundle.
[39:01.460 --> 39:03.840]  And that's pretty much exactly the pricing
[39:03.840 --> 39:05.100]  for individual and family.
[39:05.100 --> 39:08.500]  Take the 10 and $15 that Apple Music costs
[39:08.500 --> 39:11.560]  as individual or a family
[39:11.560 --> 39:16.560]  and add $5 a month and include not everything else,
[39:16.980 --> 39:21.980]  but the arcade and the TV Plus
[39:22.200 --> 39:24.180]  and some iCloud storage,
[39:24.180 --> 39:25.900]  which I still really feel like
[39:25.900 --> 39:27.620]  they're nickel and diming people on.
[39:27.620 --> 39:30.580]  Like for the individual thing,
[39:30.580 --> 39:33.880]  it's like to upgrade the people to the 50 gigabytes
[39:33.880 --> 39:35.360]  when they're selling these phones
[39:35.360 --> 39:38.080]  that have 512 gigabytes of storage
[39:38.080 --> 39:43.080]  and shoot 4K video that easily fills up 50 gigabytes
[39:43.860 --> 39:45.260]  if you're shooting it a lot.
[39:46.320 --> 39:48.060]  It's like, wow, I can't believe that.
[39:48.060 --> 39:50.940]  If these people are gonna give you $20 or $15 a month,
[39:50.940 --> 39:53.580]  why not just give them more of that storage
[39:53.580 --> 39:54.420]  for their backups?
[39:54.420 --> 39:55.260]  But anyway.
[39:56.440 --> 39:59.940]  I used to feel the same way about storage in general
[39:59.940 --> 40:01.040]  on the device, right?
[40:01.040 --> 40:03.660]  The markup for whatever the base level iPhone,
[40:03.660 --> 40:07.040]  which early on became an unusable amount of storage, right?
[40:07.040 --> 40:09.180]  You had to get a higher level.
[40:09.180 --> 40:12.220]  It was an enormous markup to go to the next level.
[40:12.220 --> 40:13.900]  Especially when it's like almost irresponsible
[40:13.900 --> 40:15.380]  to sell the phone at sort of the base level,
[40:15.380 --> 40:16.220]  whatever that used to be.
[40:16.220 --> 40:17.060]  I remember having a tell.
[40:17.060 --> 40:17.900]  It was 16.
[40:17.900 --> 40:19.220]  I remember having a tell relative.
[40:19.220 --> 40:20.300]  It was like, you don't buy that.
[40:20.300 --> 40:21.380]  Like you think you're saving money,
[40:21.380 --> 40:23.660]  but you don't want to have a function.
[40:23.660 --> 40:25.580]  It was 16 gigabytes that they stuck with
[40:25.580 --> 40:27.700]  as the base for way too long.
[40:27.700 --> 40:29.940]  Because at 16 gigabytes,
[40:29.940 --> 40:33.060]  it was like half of it was taken up by the operating system.
[40:33.060 --> 40:36.780]  Like once they burst past 16,
[40:36.780 --> 40:40.400]  even the 32, it's like you mostly get 32.
[40:40.400 --> 40:43.040]  But with 16, you didn't even get close to 16
[40:43.040 --> 40:46.120]  of usable storage because the OS and everything else
[40:46.120 --> 40:46.960]  had to be in there.
[40:46.960 --> 40:49.380]  And they had to reserve enough space
[40:49.380 --> 40:52.100]  so that you could do software updates.
[40:52.100 --> 40:54.260]  And even if they only reserve like two gigabytes
[40:54.260 --> 40:55.920]  so that when a software update comes,
[40:55.920 --> 40:58.980]  there's space to write the update before doing the update.
[40:58.980 --> 41:01.300]  It's like if you're only giving people 16,
[41:01.300 --> 41:04.360]  you're taking away one eighth of their storage.
[41:04.360 --> 41:05.820]  Yeah, and I think you're right.
[41:05.820 --> 41:09.780]  I think music and the data are by far
[41:09.780 --> 41:12.040]  the most widely used of those offerings.
[41:12.040 --> 41:14.460]  And I think there are probably tens of millions of people
[41:14.460 --> 41:16.340]  who are using both music and data.
[41:16.340 --> 41:18.420]  And so right there, you're getting pretty close.
[41:18.420 --> 41:21.020]  But the big difference between those two, though,
[41:21.020 --> 41:22.500]  is music is fun.
[41:22.500 --> 41:24.460]  People want to listen to music.
[41:24.460 --> 41:27.580]  And why do people listen to music?
[41:27.580 --> 41:30.380]  Because music makes them happy, right?
[41:30.380 --> 41:34.420]  It's very, you know, it's the one form of our media
[41:34.420 --> 41:39.420]  that is just the closest, it's just purely emotional, right?
[41:39.700 --> 41:40.740]  It makes you happy.
[41:40.740 --> 41:43.320]  That's why you pay for streaming music.
[41:43.320 --> 41:45.460]  Why do you pay for iCloud storage?
[41:45.460 --> 41:48.580]  It is the most cerebral aspect of this offering.
[41:48.580 --> 41:50.560]  It is medicine, to be honest.
[41:50.560 --> 41:53.540]  It is, you're signing up to take some vitamins.
[41:53.540 --> 41:55.260]  And you should be taking them,
[41:55.260 --> 41:58.060]  and you should have enough storage in your iCloud plan
[41:58.060 --> 42:00.440]  so that you can back up your devices.
[42:00.440 --> 42:04.600]  Because having those backups in iCloud is really fantastic
[42:04.600 --> 42:06.900]  and a great way to make sure you don't lose your photos
[42:06.900 --> 42:08.620]  and stuff like that.
[42:08.620 --> 42:10.300]  But it's medicine, right?
[42:10.300 --> 42:11.700]  It's no fun at all.
[42:11.700 --> 42:16.600]  Upgrading from the base storage to more storage.
[42:16.600 --> 42:17.900]  You don't see anything.
[42:17.900 --> 42:20.780]  You don't get to watch a funny episode of Ted Lasso.
[42:20.780 --> 42:21.900]  You don't get to listen.
[42:21.900 --> 42:23.500]  You don't get to brag to someone
[42:23.500 --> 42:25.320]  about how big your storage is?
[42:25.320 --> 42:26.840]  You get, it's medicine.
[42:27.700 --> 42:30.300]  It's good, but that's why I feel like
[42:30.300 --> 42:31.880]  they should just offer everybody
[42:31.880 --> 42:34.740]  who gets into this Apple One bundle the two gigabytes,
[42:34.740 --> 42:36.980]  honestly, or terabytes.
[42:38.500 --> 42:40.460]  And it's like, well, that's more than anybody needs.
[42:40.460 --> 42:42.680]  Well, then fine, then they don't have to worry about it.
[42:42.680 --> 42:44.580]  But isn't that a great, anyway,
[42:44.580 --> 42:46.060]  that's my argument on that.
[42:46.060 --> 42:49.220]  Well, yeah, and frankly, I think that should be factored
[42:49.220 --> 42:50.940]  into your $1,000 phone.
[42:50.940 --> 42:51.900]  Right, right.
[42:51.900 --> 42:52.940]  You're paying this much,
[42:52.940 --> 42:54.580]  or you're paying this much for Apple Care.
[42:54.580 --> 42:55.880]  The storage should come with that.
[42:55.880 --> 42:58.620]  Like, it should just be a thing you don't have to decide
[42:58.620 --> 43:01.920]  you need to buy when the thing you wanted to access
[43:01.920 --> 43:04.260]  is no longer available than you thought it was, right?
[43:04.260 --> 43:08.180]  That's, it's not just medicine, right, or exercise.
[43:08.180 --> 43:11.660]  It's finding out you needed, you should have had the storage
[43:11.660 --> 43:13.260]  but didn't, and now you have a,
[43:13.260 --> 43:15.060]  there's something bad has happened.
[43:16.220 --> 43:17.060]  Yeah, so I-
[43:17.060 --> 43:17.900]  Oh, you wish.
[43:17.900 --> 43:18.900]  Oh, I would have just gone ahead
[43:18.900 --> 43:20.620]  and bought it in advance.
[43:20.620 --> 43:23.840]  So anyway, I think music might be that linchpin.
[43:26.360 --> 43:27.980]  If you like listening to music,
[43:27.980 --> 43:32.000]  you need at least one streaming music plan in today's world.
[43:32.000 --> 43:34.540]  And if it's gonna be Apple Music,
[43:34.540 --> 43:37.780]  then why not spend $5 more a month and get the Apple One,
[43:37.780 --> 43:39.220]  and then you get the TV shows
[43:39.220 --> 43:41.340]  and whatever else, the arcade games?
[43:44.180 --> 43:47.340]  Yeah, I just, to me, if they said, yeah,
[43:47.340 --> 43:50.720]  Apple Music now comes with these following three services,
[43:50.720 --> 43:52.820]  that makes, that's the Amazon model, right?
[43:52.820 --> 43:54.420]  Here's the thing you're already buying,
[43:54.420 --> 43:56.580]  now we're throwing more stuff in.
[43:56.580 --> 43:59.300]  And maybe gradually over time, we up the price,
[43:59.300 --> 44:01.020]  and you're not complaining,
[44:01.020 --> 44:02.900]  because we're making it harder,
[44:02.900 --> 44:05.340]  we're making it stickier, right?
[44:05.340 --> 44:07.460]  Less churn by adding more stuff.
[44:07.460 --> 44:08.560]  But trying to say, look,
[44:08.560 --> 44:09.960]  you're already paying for this thing,
[44:09.960 --> 44:12.400]  why don't you pay a little more and get more stuff?
[44:12.400 --> 44:14.140]  If it's not stuff you want,
[44:15.060 --> 44:16.700]  that's where it falls flat for me.
[44:17.900 --> 44:22.900]  Yeah, so, and I guess that is sort of,
[44:22.900 --> 44:25.940]  you know, how important is this?
[44:25.940 --> 44:28.660]  You know, why even bother with Apple Music?
[44:28.660 --> 44:31.760]  Why let, you know, why it's,
[44:32.920 --> 44:35.380]  why not walk away from the music business?
[44:35.380 --> 44:37.700]  I mean, I guess I think I see why,
[44:37.700 --> 44:39.160]  you know, Apple cares about it.
[44:39.160 --> 44:44.160]  But what the iTunes buy a song for 99 cents revolution
[44:44.380 --> 44:46.840]  meant to the company 20 years ago,
[44:48.340 --> 44:51.540]  it really helped rejuvenate the company, you know?
[44:51.540 --> 44:54.020]  And it's what drove the iPod sales.
[44:54.020 --> 44:56.460]  And I remember when Apple retail stores
[44:56.460 --> 44:58.340]  first started opening in malls,
[44:58.340 --> 44:59.980]  if you perked your ears open,
[44:59.980 --> 45:01.920]  you'd hear kids saying,
[45:01.920 --> 45:05.540]  hey, let's go to the iPod store, right?
[45:05.540 --> 45:08.840]  It was really what made the company relevant.
[45:09.900 --> 45:12.560]  Does Apple need to be in the music business today?
[45:12.560 --> 45:13.400]  I mean, it's too late.
[45:13.400 --> 45:15.140]  They're obviously not gonna get out of it,
[45:15.140 --> 45:19.580]  but it's not essential to what they do
[45:19.580 --> 45:23.240]  or, you know, all that meaningful to them financially.
[45:24.460 --> 45:27.440]  No, it's, I mean, it's in the billions of dollars now,
[45:27.440 --> 45:31.280]  right, so it starts to become meaningful
[45:31.280 --> 45:34.640]  and they couldn't take it away without having a problem.
[45:34.640 --> 45:36.660]  And I think we're sort of explaining
[45:36.660 --> 45:38.140]  why they need to be in the music business.
[45:38.140 --> 45:39.980]  If you wanna create a bundle of services,
[45:39.980 --> 45:41.620]  you need to have something that people want,
[45:41.620 --> 45:43.220]  and that's the thing.
[45:43.220 --> 45:45.460]  It's not games, it's not Apple News,
[45:45.460 --> 45:47.580]  and it's not Apple TV Plus for the moment.
[45:47.580 --> 45:50.060]  So here's the one thing that tens of millions of people
[45:50.060 --> 45:51.380]  are willingly paying for.
[45:52.940 --> 45:55.540]  And, you know, and I think that's what they were thinking,
[45:55.540 --> 45:56.820]  you know, that this is something
[45:56.820 --> 45:59.620]  we don't wanna walk away from, and there's their linchpin.
[45:59.620 --> 46:03.580]  But then, now this gets into the competitive aspects.
[46:03.580 --> 46:05.500]  You had a comment yesterday,
[46:05.500 --> 46:07.860]  right after the event from Spotify.
[46:07.860 --> 46:10.140]  Here, here's their statement that you tweeted.
[46:10.140 --> 46:12.300]  Once again, Apple is using its dominant position
[46:12.300 --> 46:14.660]  in unfair practices to disadvantage competitors
[46:14.660 --> 46:17.100]  and deprive consumers by favoring its own services.
[46:17.100 --> 46:20.020]  We call on competition authorities to act urgently
[46:20.020 --> 46:23.020]  to restrict Apple's anti-competitive behavior,
[46:23.020 --> 46:26.140]  which if left unchecked will cause irreparable harm
[46:26.140 --> 46:27.740]  to the developer community
[46:27.740 --> 46:29.720]  and threaten our collective freedoms
[46:29.720 --> 46:31.760]  to listen, learn, create, and connect.
[46:33.660 --> 46:34.500]  It's a little purple.
[46:34.500 --> 46:35.340]  A little.
[46:35.340 --> 46:40.340]  I take solace in a little bit like that being purple.
[46:42.660 --> 46:47.660]  I, like, in normal times, I'd hurt my eyes,
[46:48.120 --> 46:50.100]  rolling my eyes at that.
[46:50.100 --> 46:54.380]  In our times, I'm like, oh no, this is fun.
[46:54.380 --> 46:57.300]  It's fun to get all indignant about something
[46:57.300 --> 47:01.660]  as trivial as streaming music
[47:01.660 --> 47:04.700]  when it's possible that come November,
[47:04.700 --> 47:07.000]  we're gonna have armed riots in the streets
[47:07.000 --> 47:09.660]  and a president who lost an election
[47:09.660 --> 47:10.960]  and refuses to acknowledge it,
[47:10.960 --> 47:13.380]  and nobody knows what to do, right?
[47:13.380 --> 47:15.500]  It's sort of like, yeah, let's argue
[47:15.500 --> 47:17.340]  about anti-competitive aspects
[47:17.340 --> 47:19.500]  of whether it's fair or unfair for Apple
[47:19.500 --> 47:21.660]  to include music in a streaming
[47:21.660 --> 47:25.480]  when it's the platform provider of the operating system.
[47:25.480 --> 47:27.200]  Yeah, I mean, the whole idea that this stuff
[47:27.200 --> 47:31.680]  is gonna get eventually kicked up to some government agency
[47:31.680 --> 47:34.000]  or a group of politicians will rule on this
[47:34.000 --> 47:37.360]  is impossible to imagine in the United States.
[47:38.360 --> 47:41.160]  And by the way, this is, it's not a coincidence
[47:41.160 --> 47:45.280]  that the Spotify Apple fight is happening in the EU.
[47:45.280 --> 47:47.800]  It's not happening in the US.
[47:47.800 --> 47:49.520]  But yeah, it's impossible to imagine.
[47:49.520 --> 47:53.640]  I do, I'm not surprised that Spotify said
[47:53.640 --> 47:55.800]  we're indignant about this.
[47:55.800 --> 47:58.880]  I think they have, and I'm not an antitrust expert,
[47:58.880 --> 48:01.480]  nor do I play one on TV, but I do think
[48:01.480 --> 48:04.040]  they have much less of a ground to stand on here
[48:04.040 --> 48:06.080]  than the base argument they have,
[48:06.080 --> 48:09.400]  which is that Apple music tied to the device
[48:09.400 --> 48:10.680]  is anti-competitive.
[48:10.680 --> 48:11.880]  If you're just gonna say, all right,
[48:11.880 --> 48:14.120]  a bunch of stuff tied to other Apple services
[48:14.120 --> 48:16.360]  is anti-competitive, it's a harder argument to make.
[48:16.360 --> 48:19.760]  And I do wonder, I wonder how much it's even worth arguing
[48:19.760 --> 48:21.240]  about how many people are like,
[48:21.240 --> 48:24.400]  well, this is my first iPhone, and I've taken it out of,
[48:24.400 --> 48:27.000]  I've unwrapped the box, and I'm turning it on,
[48:27.000 --> 48:30.760]  and I'm going through this, and I have no backup to restore.
[48:30.760 --> 48:31.840]  I'm new to this.
[48:31.840 --> 48:34.920]  Oh, and there right in my dock is a music app.
[48:34.920 --> 48:38.640]  And I tap the music app, and I'm prompted
[48:38.640 --> 48:40.160]  to sign up for Apple Music.
[48:41.200 --> 48:44.120]  That's basically the gist of what Spotify's complaining
[48:44.120 --> 48:44.960]  about, right?
[48:44.960 --> 48:46.800]  And it is.
[48:46.800 --> 48:48.480]  It's that plus pricing.
[48:48.480 --> 48:51.160]  Right, because they don't have to pay the $30,000.
[48:51.160 --> 48:54.200]  Apple doesn't have to pay itself 30%
[48:54.200 --> 48:56.600]  for an in-app purchase to sign up.
[48:56.600 --> 48:59.800]  And I do feel that there's arguments to be made there.
[48:59.800 --> 49:02.280]  Again, I'm not a legal expert,
[49:02.280 --> 49:04.320]  but just common sense tells you, well,
[49:04.320 --> 49:06.880]  that that is something to argue about, right?
[49:06.880 --> 49:08.960]  I mean, common sense says,
[49:08.960 --> 49:11.360]  whether that should be allowed or not,
[49:11.360 --> 49:15.160]  it's at least in this sphere of a debatable,
[49:15.160 --> 49:19.560]  this is something that's logical to debate.
[49:19.560 --> 49:23.600]  I think that what Spotify's arguing here with the bundle,
[49:23.600 --> 49:27.680]  to me, is sort of getting into the tiny violin,
[49:27.680 --> 49:30.320]  you know, playing the world's saddest song,
[49:31.360 --> 49:34.320]  because Apple could do so much more here.
[49:34.320 --> 49:39.320]  Really, the bundle that would really be both lowercase A,
[49:39.320 --> 49:42.440]  now I'm not saying legally anti-competitive, I don't know,
[49:42.440 --> 49:46.000]  but certainly lowercase A anti-competitive
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.640]  in the common sense term would be if they said,
[49:48.640 --> 49:50.840]  pay us X dollars a month,
[49:50.840 --> 49:55.320]  and we'll give you a new iPhone every two years too, right?
[49:55.320 --> 49:58.720]  So this is the most interesting thing,
[49:58.720 --> 50:01.160]  and it's a thing that didn't happen, right?
[50:01.160 --> 50:02.880]  But why did that not happen?
[50:02.880 --> 50:04.800]  People like you and I have been speculating
[50:04.800 --> 50:06.640]  about an Apple bundle that would,
[50:06.640 --> 50:09.000]  basically, you did an all-in Apple subscription service
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.320]  where you're paying for your phone and AppleCare
[50:11.320 --> 50:13.920]  and a bunch of other stuff, and it's one monthly fee,
[50:13.920 --> 50:17.080]  and a lot of people say, give me that, I want that.
[50:17.080 --> 50:18.680]  And so why didn't they do it?
[50:20.000 --> 50:24.160]  And a really obvious guess, a semi-informed guess
[50:24.160 --> 50:26.480]  on my part is, maybe they do wanna do it,
[50:26.480 --> 50:28.240]  but they certainly can't do it in today's
[50:28.240 --> 50:30.120]  political climate when they're fighting anti-trust.
[50:30.120 --> 50:34.400]  And then the question is, okay,
[50:34.400 --> 50:36.280]  is this something they think they can get to
[50:36.280 --> 50:38.080]  X number of years down the road?
[50:38.080 --> 50:40.160]  Is this something they've held off on doing
[50:40.160 --> 50:41.800]  because they were hoping to be able to do it,
[50:41.800 --> 50:44.560]  and they've concluded, look, we just can't do that
[50:44.560 --> 50:47.280]  anytime soon, so this is what we got.
[50:48.560 --> 50:51.480]  But to me, it's the obvious thing that's,
[50:51.480 --> 50:55.000]  to answer, to respond to the thing I was positing earlier,
[50:55.000 --> 50:58.720]  like that's the thing, their version of sports, TV,
[50:58.720 --> 51:00.800]  and free shipping is the phone,
[51:00.800 --> 51:02.520]  and so you should bundle it with the phone,
[51:02.520 --> 51:03.920]  and why aren't they doing that?
[51:03.920 --> 51:05.800]  And they're certainly not gonna come out and say,
[51:05.800 --> 51:07.400]  we'd love to do it, but we'll get killed
[51:07.400 --> 51:08.600]  by the anti-trust guys.
[51:10.080 --> 51:12.400]  And for all I know, they're gonna announce it next fall,
[51:12.400 --> 51:14.600]  the next, with the iPhone, they'll say,
[51:14.600 --> 51:16.240]  ah, now here's the super duper bundle,
[51:16.240 --> 51:18.240]  but I don't, I think they would wait, right?
[51:18.240 --> 51:20.040]  You wouldn't announce the bundle until,
[51:20.040 --> 51:21.920]  if you were gonna do a super bundle, you'd do it all.
[51:21.920 --> 51:24.920]  Yeah, I think so too, especially since they've already
[51:24.920 --> 51:26.320]  called the one-tier premiere,
[51:26.320 --> 51:28.440]  and not that they couldn't add a super premiere
[51:28.440 --> 51:29.960]  that includes a new iPhone.
[51:29.960 --> 51:31.720]  Super premiere max.
[51:32.720 --> 51:37.400]  But that is the, and it is the thing
[51:37.400 --> 51:40.640]  that I still think has at least,
[51:40.640 --> 51:42.800]  I don't wanna project more than 10 years in the future,
[51:42.800 --> 51:45.000]  but I think for the next 10 years,
[51:45.000 --> 51:48.440]  the idea that people will still want a new phone
[51:48.440 --> 51:53.440]  every two or three years is pretty solid bet,
[51:54.360 --> 51:58.240]  just in terms of camera improvements and stuff, right?
[51:58.240 --> 52:00.440]  If only camera improvements.
[52:00.440 --> 52:04.000]  I really think that five years from now,
[52:04.000 --> 52:06.960]  we'll look back at what our cameras do now on these phones
[52:06.960 --> 52:09.040]  and be like, oh my God, can you believe that piece of junk?
[52:09.040 --> 52:10.880]  Whereas now we're amazed by it.
[52:10.880 --> 52:13.040]  So I think there's legs on that,
[52:13.040 --> 52:15.120]  that it would be a huge appeal if they said,
[52:15.120 --> 52:16.680]  okay, here, just pay us,
[52:16.680 --> 52:18.160]  I don't know what it would be a month,
[52:18.160 --> 52:20.480]  and every two years you get a new iPhone
[52:20.480 --> 52:23.000]  and you get all these services.
[52:23.000 --> 52:24.680]  It's just one gut.
[52:24.680 --> 52:27.000]  Yeah, and whether you care about any spec at all,
[52:27.000 --> 52:28.400]  you just say, look, I just don't care.
[52:28.400 --> 52:30.840]  I know that whatever phone I have is the best phone.
[52:30.840 --> 52:32.120]  I don't need to worry about it.
[52:32.120 --> 52:33.920]  I can afford not to worry about it.
[52:33.920 --> 52:36.120]  This would obviously be towards a wealthier tier
[52:36.120 --> 52:38.960]  of Apple customers who are wealthy to begin
[52:38.960 --> 52:40.160]  with generally speaking.
[52:41.440 --> 52:43.800]  That's a gross generalization,
[52:43.800 --> 52:45.880]  but compared to an Android consumer,
[52:47.600 --> 52:49.240]  that seems like the no brainer.
[52:49.240 --> 52:52.080]  And so its absence is super interesting to me.
[52:52.080 --> 52:56.680]  And it just happens to be in the wake of Microsoft
[52:56.680 --> 52:59.960]  announcing the same sort of kind of idea
[52:59.960 --> 53:02.560]  with the new Xbox console hardwares,
[53:03.560 --> 53:06.520]  the Series S and the Series X,
[53:06.520 --> 53:11.160]  which I really, it's almost like a speech therapy exercise
[53:11.160 --> 53:15.600]  to make sure that audibly I say S and X differently.
[53:15.600 --> 53:16.440]  Oh, it's so bad.
[53:16.440 --> 53:18.680]  But with their game streaming service,
[53:18.680 --> 53:21.120]  and it's, Ben Thompson and I have talked about this
[53:21.120 --> 53:24.160]  on Dithering, it's really a very appealing deal
[53:24.160 --> 53:27.840]  because it's not like a credit card thing
[53:27.840 --> 53:30.360]  where you're paying interest
[53:30.360 --> 53:32.840]  and you wind up paying more over two years
[53:32.840 --> 53:35.080]  than you would have if you just bought it outright.
[53:35.080 --> 53:39.920]  As long as you're interested in the monthly game service,
[53:39.920 --> 53:43.600]  you do this for two years for a monthly fee
[53:43.600 --> 53:45.760]  and including the game service,
[53:45.760 --> 53:48.560]  you wind up owning an Xbox console at the end
[53:48.560 --> 53:50.360]  for a very appealing monthly rate,
[53:50.360 --> 53:52.400]  and you don't really pay a penalty for it
[53:52.400 --> 53:55.200]  in terms of interest or whatever.
[53:55.200 --> 53:59.560]  And all of a sudden, this multi-hundred dollar console
[53:59.560 --> 54:03.560]  and a library of lots of games has this very appealing,
[54:03.560 --> 54:05.400]  oh, it's 25 bucks a month, that's it.
[54:06.720 --> 54:09.120]  Yeah, it's super compelling, and we're a household
[54:09.120 --> 54:10.520]  where we're considering making our first
[54:10.520 --> 54:12.360]  sort of big console purchase in a long time,
[54:12.360 --> 54:14.640]  and we're thinking through this right now.
[54:14.640 --> 54:16.680]  And they've had that for a while now,
[54:16.680 --> 54:18.320]  but they're certainly pushing more and more
[54:18.320 --> 54:22.160]  towards gaming as a service,
[54:22.160 --> 54:24.480]  and where the device is secondary.
[54:24.480 --> 54:27.360]  And Apple is definitely not in that mode, right?
[54:27.360 --> 54:28.840]  Apple is still, the device is primary.
[54:28.840 --> 54:31.800]  And so we have to go meta for a moment here
[54:31.800 --> 54:34.040]  and just acknowledge, and you and I, again,
[54:34.040 --> 54:35.520]  we're of a certain age,
[54:35.520 --> 54:39.320]  where can you imagine going back 25 years, 20 years,
[54:39.320 --> 54:42.760]  and telling our former selves that in the year 2020,
[54:42.760 --> 54:47.520]  we're gonna be talking about Microsoft and Apple
[54:47.520 --> 54:52.520]  and one company feeling free and liberated antitrust-wise
[54:54.040 --> 54:56.680]  to offer these content bundles and the other one
[54:57.720 --> 55:01.360]  sitting on its hands missing an obvious opportunity
[55:01.360 --> 55:05.520]  and it's Apple that's sort of staring down the barrel
[55:05.520 --> 55:09.680]  of anti-competition regulators and Microsoft
[55:09.680 --> 55:12.480]  that is like, here, here's this super compelling deal.
[55:12.480 --> 55:16.280]  Yeah, and also Microsoft being the company
[55:16.280 --> 55:19.640]  that could conceivably have spent 20 or $30 billion
[55:19.640 --> 55:23.360]  to buy the hottest new social media slash video service
[55:23.360 --> 55:25.440]  and all the rest of its competitors couldn't
[55:25.440 --> 55:26.560]  because they were too powerful.
[55:26.560 --> 55:30.800]  Right, that does sort of go unsaid
[55:30.800 --> 55:35.800]  in the whole TikTok fiasco was that Microsoft was...
[55:39.040 --> 55:40.760]  There was no other consumer tech company
[55:40.760 --> 55:43.320]  that could have plausibly tried to get that deal through.
[55:43.320 --> 55:44.160]  Right.
[55:45.280 --> 55:47.880]  I know somebody, there was a report somebody had earlier
[55:47.880 --> 55:50.080]  that Apple at least took a meeting or something
[55:50.080 --> 55:51.640]  and it's like, I couldn't imagine that
[55:51.640 --> 55:53.960]  because I guess...
[55:53.960 --> 55:58.760]  Apple, Apple, Apple, Apple was excited to bat that down.
[55:58.760 --> 55:59.840]  It doesn't make any sense.
[55:59.840 --> 56:02.240]  That's one of those like, yes, someone called someone
[56:02.240 --> 56:04.600]  from Apple or a banker said they talked to Apple once
[56:04.600 --> 56:05.440]  or something like that.
[56:05.440 --> 56:07.760]  Apple, they went from we don't comment
[56:07.760 --> 56:11.440]  on rumor and speculation to hell no, there's no way.
[56:11.440 --> 56:15.280]  It was just sort of the old salesman trick of,
[56:15.280 --> 56:18.360]  hey, you know that rich guy, he's interested.
[56:18.360 --> 56:21.080]  Yeah, I got a lot of people coming down to look at this car
[56:21.080 --> 56:23.880]  so I can't promise it's here tomorrow.
[56:23.880 --> 56:25.080]  Very, very true.
[56:25.080 --> 56:26.360]  I wanna keep going on streaming
[56:26.360 --> 56:28.800]  but I have one more sponsor I wanna thank on this episode
[56:28.800 --> 56:30.920]  and it's, oh man, do I love this company.
[56:30.920 --> 56:32.560]  Mack Weldon.
[56:32.560 --> 56:35.520]  Mack Weldon believes in smart design, premium fabrics
[56:35.520 --> 56:36.880]  and simple shopping.
[56:38.240 --> 56:39.800]  They sell all sorts of stuff.
[56:39.800 --> 56:42.080]  They got started selling underwear, socks,
[56:42.080 --> 56:45.240]  all this sort of dependables that you need in your lower,
[56:45.240 --> 56:48.200]  I keep them in my lower drawers, undershirts and underwear
[56:48.200 --> 56:49.800]  and socks and stuff like that.
[56:49.800 --> 56:53.880]  But they've got all sorts of stuff now, hoodies and polos.
[56:53.880 --> 56:57.520]  I had a polo on yesterday from Mack Weldon, love it.
[56:57.520 --> 56:59.040]  One of my all time favorites.
[56:59.040 --> 57:01.560]  They have a new line of silver underwear and shirts
[57:01.560 --> 57:04.320]  that are naturally anti-microbial
[57:04.320 --> 57:05.640]  which means they eliminate odor.
[57:05.640 --> 57:08.760]  It's a very friendly way of saying they don't get stinky.
[57:10.320 --> 57:12.800]  But they're super comfortable, very stylish.
[57:12.800 --> 57:14.160]  I love all the color options.
[57:14.160 --> 57:17.360]  They have great, even just great packaging.
[57:17.360 --> 57:18.960]  I'm a nerd for stuff like that
[57:18.960 --> 57:20.920]  but I like it when I open a new thing
[57:20.920 --> 57:23.280]  and like the packaging is nice and it smells good
[57:23.280 --> 57:25.480]  just coming out of the packaging.
[57:25.480 --> 57:27.680]  Mack Weldon stuff is like that.
[57:27.680 --> 57:32.680]  They have even created their own new totally free
[57:32.680 --> 57:35.720]  loyalty program that they call Weldon Blue.
[57:35.720 --> 57:37.160]  Now you just buy more stuff.
[57:37.160 --> 57:38.320]  All you have to do is buy the stuff
[57:38.320 --> 57:40.440]  you're already buying from Mack Weldon
[57:40.440 --> 57:43.040]  and they just escalate you through the thing.
[57:43.040 --> 57:45.920]  Once you get to level one, you get free shipping for life.
[57:45.920 --> 57:47.960]  So you sort of get that, hey,
[57:47.960 --> 57:50.160]  if you just need some underwear, you just buy it
[57:50.160 --> 57:52.640]  and you know you're getting free shipping.
[57:52.640 --> 57:55.480]  And then once you reach level two,
[57:55.480 --> 57:57.720]  you only have to spend 200 bucks to get there.
[57:58.920 --> 58:03.040]  You start getting 20% off every order for the next year.
[58:03.040 --> 58:05.600]  So you spend 200 bucks, not that much.
[58:05.600 --> 58:07.960]  You've already got level one, which is free shipping
[58:07.960 --> 58:11.040]  and now you save 20% on every order for the next year
[58:11.040 --> 58:12.720]  as long as you stay at level two.
[58:12.720 --> 58:13.640]  It's a great deal.
[58:13.640 --> 58:16.320]  And there's no fee or anything like that.
[58:16.320 --> 58:17.440]  You just buy good stuff.
[58:17.440 --> 58:21.640]  I wear their stuff all the time, really do like it.
[58:21.640 --> 58:24.080]  Here's the deal, go to Mack Weldon,
[58:24.080 --> 58:29.080]  M-A-C-K-W-E-L-D-O-N dot com slash talk show.
[58:29.880 --> 58:32.480]  Mack Weldon dot com slash talk show.
[58:32.480 --> 58:35.840]  Enter the promo code, talk show, same code.
[58:35.840 --> 58:39.000]  And that'll get you 20% off your first order.
[58:39.000 --> 58:40.800]  It's like you're already at level two.
[58:40.800 --> 58:44.480]  There you go, Mack Weldon, go and buy nice clothing.
[58:45.840 --> 58:47.640]  Dude, I thought I'd do good Mack Weldon ads,
[58:47.640 --> 58:48.840]  but that was great.
[58:48.840 --> 58:50.720]  You know what, I love it when it's,
[58:50.720 --> 58:53.320]  and it just sounds corny and it's like, you know,
[58:53.320 --> 58:55.280]  but I just love it when it's a sponsor
[58:55.280 --> 58:56.440]  whose stuff I really love.
[58:56.440 --> 58:57.280]  And it's like-
[58:57.280 --> 59:00.200]  My line is I spend my own money on their product,
[59:00.200 --> 59:01.040]  which is true.
[59:01.040 --> 59:04.920]  Oh, I should mention too, a year ago,
[59:04.920 --> 59:06.120]  Merlin Mann was on the show
[59:06.120 --> 59:08.520]  and I was telling him about the Mack Weldon slippers
[59:08.520 --> 59:12.600]  and then they sold out and they were not a sponsor.
[59:12.600 --> 59:14.160]  We were just talking about them,
[59:14.160 --> 59:15.280]  but I love their slippers
[59:15.280 --> 59:18.000]  because they have a little back so that they stay on.
[59:18.000 --> 59:19.760]  I don't like a backless slipper.
[59:19.760 --> 59:23.160]  And lo and behold, a pandemic hits.
[59:23.160 --> 59:24.600]  I didn't put real shoes on.
[59:24.600 --> 59:27.120]  I wore out a pair of the slippers,
[59:27.120 --> 59:28.200]  but they were the,
[59:28.200 --> 59:32.440]  I've probably spent like 10 years worth of time in slippers
[59:32.440 --> 59:35.000]  in the last six months with the Mack Weldon slippers.
[59:35.000 --> 59:35.880]  They're fantastic.
[59:35.880 --> 59:38.880]  They're the best slippers I've ever owned.
[59:38.880 --> 59:39.720]  Cosine.
[59:41.480 --> 59:45.840]  So let's talk streaming in the big world, right?
[59:45.840 --> 59:47.360]  And where Apple is.
[59:47.360 --> 59:51.920]  I kind of feel like, here's an interesting thought I had
[59:51.920 --> 59:53.920]  as I was going off to sleep last night
[59:53.920 --> 59:56.280]  after absorbing all of this.
[59:56.280 --> 59:59.280]  So Apple comes out with this new fitness plus thing,
[59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.680]  which is not for me.
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:03.240]  Oh my God, that Twitter fight.
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:04.080]  Oh, what's this?
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:04.920]  I don't know, it was a Twitter,
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:05.760]  no, no, you were involved in it.
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:06.600]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.440]  Watching you and Horace and Ben.
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.400]  Oh, and the Peloton, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:10.800]  Oh my God, yeah.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:15.640]  People that, you know what, Peloton is, I've said this,
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:16.920]  I've been staying with Ben.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.080]  So we have a Peloton.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.280]  I don't use it, my wife does,
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:21.560]  as she won't even let me use it.
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.720]  She's very serious about it.
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:26.480]  I guess she would let me use it if I asked to.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:29.000]  But we are a Peloton family.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.400]  Ben has one too.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:34.080]  It is exactly like arguing with people
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:36.960]  about Macintosh computers 20, 25 years ago,
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:40.920]  where people who've never used one, never seen a Macintosh,
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:44.560]  will just tell you blindly that they're overpriced garbage
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.880]  and you're buying hype and you could buy this other thing
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.200]  for less and it's better.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:51.360]  And people saying that you should just buy a regular bicycle
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:53.160]  and put it on a treadmill or something
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:54.320]  and then you get the same thing.
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.400]  And it's like, you don't get it.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.680]  This is like one of the nicest pieces of a kit
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.000]  I've ever seen in my life.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:02.880]  My wife-
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:03.720]  They're very good.
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:06.240]  And I was a reluctant buyer
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.320]  because I didn't want to own one of them.
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.160]  There was a pandemic.
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:09.920]  I'm like, all right, because I'm not going to the gym.
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:12.120]  But, and it's very good and all of that.
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:14.240]  And yes, there's definitely a cult around it.
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.440]  I'm not in the cult.
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.080]  It's a fine product, I'm happy to buy it,
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.360]  but I'm not going to go sing its praises.
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.560]  The thing that I find confusing from people
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:22.800]  who should know better is saying
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:26.320]  that the Apple exercise thing is competitive with Peloton,
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.480]  but that makes no sense.
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:28.840]  It makes no sense at all.
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.760]  It's competitive with a million other free
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:36.480]  and paid workout apps and videos, not with a device.
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:40.680]  Right, and the device is, it's the starting point.
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.840]  It's not like you sign up for Peloton classes
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.280]  and then, oh, maybe you get the bike.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:46.280]  It's like you decide to get the bike
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:47.760]  and then you sign up for the classes.
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:48.600]  It's a great product.
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.440]  Right, you could technically, I mean,
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:53.640]  Peloton has sold some people its subscription service
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:55.360]  who don't use the bike,
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.760]  but that's a very small group of people.
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:00.360]  Yeah, and it's not central to their success.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.560]  It's not their, that's not their company's story.
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:06.440]  And it's not why people who are bullish on them are bullish.
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:09.440]  Anyway, I think that the fitness thing
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.080]  is orthogonal to Peloton.
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:12.480]  I don't want to get sidetracked on that.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:14.840]  But the one thought I had going to sleep last night is,
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.160]  okay, what is the fitness plus thing?
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:21.480]  In a sense, if you, they talked about it all
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.040]  in the context of actual fitness
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:27.480]  and you wear your watch and you measure all this stuff.
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:29.240]  Fitness, fitness, fitness, that's what you sign,
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:30.640]  it's certainly why you would sign up for it.
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:35.640]  But really, all it is is a streaming video platform, right?
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:41.840]  It looks like they've signed up about 30 trainers.
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:46.040]  I didn't do like a headcount in the class photo,
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:50.000]  but they have, looks like somewhere around 30 or 40 trainers
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:54.440]  to do these, and they, some of them have specialties.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.880]  Some of these might be in bicycling or somebody,
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.840]  strength training is obviously very different
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:00.180]  than cardio training.
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:04.440]  And it seems like, and they talked about
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.520]  that the diversity's obvious just when you look at it,
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.120]  but apparently personality-wise and background-wise,
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.920]  it's very diverse, but it's sort of like a reality show
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:16.120]  where there's like, they've got a cast of trainers
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:18.960]  and you can get to know them and they have personalities.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:24.440]  It's 10 bucks a month, and Apple TV Plus
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.760]  is five bucks a month.
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.960]  Which one costs more to produce?
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:33.080]  It's clearly TV Plus, right?
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:36.840]  TV Plus, they're spending billions of dollars a year
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:40.500]  on original content, and it costs five dollars.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.320]  The scope, I'm not saying that me and you, Peter,
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.620]  can go out and hire 30 trainers,
[01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:50.400]  but I feel like I could understand the scope
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:53.840]  of setting up a direct competitor to Fitness Plus, right?
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:57.040]  Get 30, 35 trainers of a diverse background
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:01.260]  and various skills and studio space and a couple of cameras,
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:03.760]  and every week we'll have a bunch of these classes.
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.920]  I understand the scope of that.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:09.040]  I don't understand the scope of making like one top-tier
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.980]  TV Plus original content series,
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:14.120]  let alone all of them and the movies that they have.
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:18.080]  Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon got, what,
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.200]  two million bucks apiece per episode?
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:23.520]  I may have inflated a 2X, but that's a lot, yeah.
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:27.280]  The cost, yeah, and now you'd have to bring in someone
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.680]  who's an actual fitness expert here.
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.900]  I mean, again, during the pandemic, our first thought was,
[01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:33.300]  oh, we gotta exercise, let's see what we can get
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:35.840]  for free on YouTube, and we didn't try very hard.
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:37.440]  But obviously there's a ton of that free stuff,
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.680]  and there are subscription services,
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:41.120]  those have existed for a long time.
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.760]  I can see Apple saying, all right, yeah,
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:45.360]  the people are paying five bucks a month for online yoga,
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:47.440]  we can charge a premium for that, fine.
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:50.500]  Or by the way, the Peloton standalone service
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:51.760]  is however many dollars a month,
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.520]  we can charge less than that, fine.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:56.760]  Right, yeah, it's like 30 bucks a month.
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.280]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:01.320]  I don't wanna argue about fitness trends.
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:05.280]  It is hard to imagine a lot of people sticking with that
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.160]  for the same reason that everyone's joke
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.840]  about the Peloton, right, is that it's gonna collect,
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:12.040]  it's gonna be a good towel rack in a year,
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.460]  because that is the traditional trajectory
[01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.320]  for any home exercise machine.
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.760]  You can get the NordicTrack or whatever it is,
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:20.840]  and then it goes unused, and I would imagine
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:23.400]  it will have the same, fitness will have
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:26.080]  the same life cycle, but I mean,
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.180]  as we were just talking about, right,
[01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:29.880]  there is a bundle of stuff, you can throw that in there.
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:30.800]  Is it in the bundle?
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:31.640]  Did I miss that?
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:34.360]  No, it is if you get the premier level,
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:37.320]  which is above family, and it's,
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:41.320]  so premier gets you, the additions are news plus
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:46.160]  and fitness plus, and I asked Apple why,
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:48.840]  I get why news plus is in a different tier,
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:51.400]  because there's, Apple doesn't own the content.
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.320]  There's marginal cost to each subscriber
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.260]  because they're paying the participating publications,
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:59.920]  and I get why news plus is, for lack of a better term,
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.520]  region locked, because the publications
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:05.960]  are largely US centric, and the other countries
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:09.280]  where it's available, it's a country by country rollout,
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:13.880]  and if you live in a Spanish speaking country,
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:15.480]  it doesn't do you any good to sign up
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:17.320]  for a news plus subscription for a bunch
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.560]  of English language publications.
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.840]  Why is fitness plus in there?
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:27.520]  Because Apple owns all the IP, and the answer is,
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:29.840]  it's not really, it's not, they were like,
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:32.220]  don't read too much about the similarities to news,
[01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:36.720]  but at a basic level right now, their initial cast
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:40.000]  of trainers are all, they all speak English,
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.680]  and so the countries where fitness plus is available
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:45.260]  are places where English is the primary language,
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:48.400]  and typical Apple, they have nothing to announce
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.360]  about further plans for other languages.
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:51.800]  But that's a very easy solve.
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:54.560]  You can find Spanish speaking trainers.
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:57.240]  Right, but why, think about it,
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:00.800]  when you buy hardware devices from Apple,
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:03.120]  or most companies, just about any company,
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:06.840]  if one of them is half the price of another,
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:10.220]  even a casual observer can figure out why.
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:15.220]  Why is the iPhone SE half the price of the iPhone 11 Pro?
[01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:18.100]  Well, it's smaller, and it's older,
[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.820]  and it doesn't have face ID, and it has the old design,
[01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:24.680]  and the camera's not as fancy, and there you go.
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.680]  It's not as good a device.
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:31.680]  But TV Plus is way more stuff that is way, way,
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.040]  way more expensive to produce,
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:37.180]  and it's only $5 a month, and Fitness Plus
[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:40.360]  is way easier to produce, way more limited,
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:41.720]  and it's $10 a month.
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:44.800]  It has, it's like an inverse correlation
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.480]  to spending for how much it costs Apple
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.880]  to produce the service.
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.440]  I don't know, maybe you can do the math
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:54.440]  where you figure out dollar spent per time used,
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:57.360]  but I mean, look, why is music $10 a month,
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:59.840]  but Netflix is $13 a month?
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:04.420]  There isn't necessarily a math you could do in your head,
[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:06.480]  or the New York Times, $15 a month.
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:09.960]  The prices are, I mean, I can tell you why Apple TV Plus
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.640]  is $5 a month, or really free, right?
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:16.640]  It's because no one would pay for it right now.
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.440]  And Apple will concede that.
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:21.300]  We don't, we're not, you give us a year minimum
[01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:23.520]  before we can sort of have a fully competitive product,
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.460]  is what they have told me in the past.
[01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:26.760]  And that's fair, right?
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:29.160]  You just can't, and presumably, Apple's saying,
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:31.040]  yeah, this fitness thing, we're gonna come out
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.560]  out of the gates, and it'll be competitive
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:36.120]  with any other subscription training service.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:40.080]  Right, so yeah, your take more or less matches mine,
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:43.360]  which is that Fitness Plus is a real product,
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:46.600]  where, what I mean by that is,
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:49.880]  they're saying $10 a month, we can turn a profit,
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:52.280]  it's a profitable business for us to sign up
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:54.840]  X million people to pay $10 a month,
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:58.320]  or to get it in their upgraded Apple One bundle,
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:01.360]  and the cost it costs us to do this.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:05.600]  Whereas TV Plus isn't intended as at all,
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:10.320]  as we plan to make a profit selling this for $5 a month,
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:12.420]  and giving it away to as many people
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:15.260]  as we possibly can excuse ourselves to give it away
[01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:18.520]  for year-long extensions at a time.
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:21.520]  It's the strategy reasons behind them
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:24.800]  getting into their own original content with TV Plus
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.240]  have nothing to do with making money
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.840]  selling it for $5 a month.
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:32.460]  And I think that's more clear now,
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.640]  and the Fitness Plus thing clarifies that
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.140]  than it was even when they announced it.
[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:38.560]  Yeah, and I guess I just would hammer on the idea
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:40.440]  that presumably they're saying,
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:44.120]  this is a finished product, this thing is competitive.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.300]  If you were using a different subscription service,
[01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:47.680]  you can compare this to that.
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:50.540]  Or if you were taking classes at your local gym,
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:51.820]  which you can no longer go to,
[01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:53.460]  you can compare this to that.
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:56.400]  Whereas you cannot compare, or you shouldn't if you're Apple,
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:00.320]  you don't want to compare TV Plus to HBO or HBO Max
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.040]  or Netflix or Disney Plus, right?
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:04.200]  There's just way more stuff on those other services.
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:07.520]  Yeah, but also each of those companies
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:12.520]  has sort of very different levels of investment in it, right?
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:15.360]  Like Netflix, what is Netflix?
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.840]  It's nothing but the streaming service, right?
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:20.200]  Right, those are different questions
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.640]  than those from the consumer, though, right?
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:26.400]  Like you're gonna spend $10 or $5 or no dollars,
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:29.940]  and so you don't care why Netflix is priced one way
[01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:31.140]  and Disney is priced another,
[01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:32.840]  you just know what you're getting for your money.
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:37.840]  Right, right, I can't think of another competitive landscape
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:42.480]  that is so disparate, though, like that, right?
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:46.040]  It's like, just to pick three, right?
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:48.840]  So Netflix, everything, the entire company,
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:52.920]  and they have a massive valuation, and I think rightly so.
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:56.480]  They're just a huge cultural touchstone worldwide,
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:01.160]  and incredible sell-through
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:04.440]  in terms of how many people have a Netflix subscription,
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.320]  but there is nothing else to the company
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:09.200]  than the monthly streaming subscription.
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.580]  Disney sort of in the middle, right?
[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:14.680]  Disney does lots of things and makes money lots of ways
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:16.640]  with theme parks and cruise lines,
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:19.040]  and God bless them for trying to fill cruise ships
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:25.160]  going forward, but motion pictures.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.320]  Right, they are trying to create their own Netflix
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:34.200]  in a significant way, and the other would-be competitors
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:37.680]  are still trying to, they're not trying to do that yet.
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:39.360]  They may say they are, but they're hedging their bets,
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:41.160]  and they're not making that same kind of commitment.
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:46.160]  Right, and Disney also is a longtime Disney nerd,
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:50.920]  and I always feel, I feel like the long-term trajectory
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:53.640]  for Apple in some ways, Disney has always been
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:56.800]  an interesting pattern to follow, right?
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:01.800]  There's the charismatic founder who died too young,
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:04.640]  you know, and what does the company do
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:07.720]  after Steve Jobs is gone, after Walt Disney is gone?
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:12.240]  But one of the things that, there's so many similarities
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:15.320]  between them, but one of the things was that Disney
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  embraced TV at a time when movie studios were anti-TV, right?
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.720]  They were like, the movie studios, you know,
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:27.300]  movies were movies, and TV was this garbage
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:29.640]  black and white thing that was staticky,
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:33.760]  and Walt Disney was like, no, we can be in their homes.
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:36.240]  Hell yeah, we're gonna have Mickey Mouse on every day
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.520]  right after school, you know, what time do schools end?
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:41.140]  Three o'clock, 3.30, every day, Mickey Mouse Club.
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:46.280]  We'll have kids running home to catch the show every day,
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:49.080]  unlike every other movie studio, and you know,
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:52.160]  culturally, Disney has always sort of had that idea
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:55.540]  of they need to stay relevant and not just keep doing
[01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:58.840]  what they did, and the way to be relevant in today's world
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:01.720]  is to have a streaming service, right?
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:04.880]  TV channels aren't it for kids anymore, right?
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.560]  It's as great as it was.
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:10.680]  Yes, yes, and it's also the model the consumer wants, right?
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:11.720]  Right.
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.580]  Broadly, right, I went on demand,
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:15.760]  and there are still a lot of people,
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:17.680]  there's 80-some million people who are getting
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:20.260]  linear cable TV, but that is going to continue to shrink,
[01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:23.600]  and they're saying, yeah, we're gonna try to transition
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:27.880]  out of our existing business while keeping it going
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:29.120]  and move into streaming.
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:31.440]  Yeah, it's working.
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.320]  I mean, it's working so far.
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.000]  And I remember being a kid,
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.560]  and I don't know how I did it,
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.800]  because it's one of those things that seems like
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:43.440]  my parents are, you know, just to put it
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:47.760]  as belovedly as I can, a bit tight with the money,
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:52.120]  and so I kind of can't believe that we got cable TV
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:55.400]  as early as we did, and I can't believe we got HBO.
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:58.280]  We had HBO like in the early 80s,
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:00.560]  and we eventually got rid of it,
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:02.080]  and I was very upset about it,
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.800]  because they were like, nobody watches it except you,
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:06.560]  and I'm like...
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:08.800]  Yeah, you were watching Porky's,
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:10.440]  and there was a Ninja movie, I think,
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:13.160]  with the big drawers.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:15.000]  Nobody watches it but you, John,
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.200]  was not a great way of selling the we're downgrading
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:22.480]  from HBO, but I just remember the same thing,
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:24.040]  where it was like, well, you know,
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:26.400]  a majority of households don't have cable TV.
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.180]  They still get their TV over the air,
[01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:32.440]  and it's like, yeah, it's hard to believe,
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:33.880]  but yeah, that's how the 80s went,
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:35.160]  where there were still lots of people
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:38.640]  who didn't have cable and had rabbit ears
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.520]  getting their TV reception.
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:43.000]  Yeah, and that turned out to be a giant expansion
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.120]  of the media business, and in the same way
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:49.200]  that the CDs were a giant expansion of the music business,
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:51.080]  what you are seeing now with all these
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:54.200]  big streaming companies is they are inevitably
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:57.040]  going to have smaller profit margins,
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:00.360]  because they do have to throw so much more into programming,
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:02.520]  because it is so much more competitive,
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.760]  because they're not gonna have that really,
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:06.480]  really fat bundle that they can sort of
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:10.220]  force people to take, and so you are gonna see
[01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:13.880]  a lot of sort of the fun, and fun and compensation
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:16.360]  taken out of working in the media business,
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.120]  which, again, doesn't matter if you're the consumer,
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.640]  and for the consumer, it's great right now.
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:21.200]  You have more choice than ever.
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:26.200]  What do you think of where Time Warner is,
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:29.120]  and HBO in particular?
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:31.440]  I find HBO, I have it, you know,
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:33.920]  and we're an HBO, we've always been an HBO family,
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.640]  and I have some shows I like there,
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:40.640]  but I think HBO Max is a mess, brand-wise.
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:46.360]  It is a mess, brand-wise, the actual sort of UI,
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:47.760]  and I'm not someone who spends a lot of time
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.700]  thinking about UI, except that I've been watching
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:52.160]  a lot of video in the last six months,
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:54.160]  or however long the pandemic's gone on for,
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:58.520]  and I'm a fan of Netflix, the product,
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:01.240]  but I didn't realize how much better they were
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.640]  at sort of getting you the thing you want
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:04.640]  than everybody else.
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:06.960]  I've been trying to watch a bunch of Amazon Prime recently.
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:10.160]  It's terrible at saying, this is the show you were watching.
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:12.360]  Would you like to continue watching it?
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.040]  All of that stuff, they're terrible at.
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:18.000]  I mean, you know, HBO Max, AT&T just brought on
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.360]  Jason Kyler, who ran Hulu in its glory days.
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.440]  He's a product guy.
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:25.240]  That product will look better eventually.
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:30.160]  It will no longer, when you're trying to watch a download
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:35.160]  of Perry Mason in your mother-in-law's Philadelphia house,
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:37.920]  to name an example that I can think of recently,
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:40.000]  and you have downloaded it, it won't require
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.160]  six extra steps for you to find that thing on your phone.
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:44.440]  It will get better.
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:48.840]  And similarly, it's a grab bag of stuff, right?
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:51.240]  Friends and the Criterion Collection.
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.240]  I think they'll sort that out over time.
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:55.600]  And the bigger question is, does AT&T,
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:58.480]  which is still a phone company
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.800]  and has an enormous amount of debt that it has to service
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.060]  and has to pay out dividends,
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:04.120]  it has all these financial obligations,
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:06.360]  do they want to spend competitively
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:09.360]  to keep up with Netflix and Disney?
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:10.200]  Right.
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:11.780]  And we don't know the answer to that yet.
[01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:14.480]  And even Apple, who I think, you know,
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:16.840]  I mean, just like the way that Apple scooped up the,
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:17.960]  I forget the name of it already,
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:20.460]  the Tom Cruise, or not Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks,
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:22.280]  World War II.
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:23.120]  Greyhound, yeah.
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:26.020]  Yeah, Greyhound, which was totally a COVID opportunity.
[01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:27.680]  It was supposed to be a big theatrical movie,
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:28.820]  but it couldn't.
[01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:32.680]  And it's just one of those things where,
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:35.000]  well, why did Apple win the bidding?
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.480]  One of the reasons is that it's a pittance for Apple, right?
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:43.480]  And, you know, oh, $100 million, whatever, you know.
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:45.000]  Sounds good.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.160]  Apple is, the most recently described to me is,
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:51.480]  this is pre-COVID, but the new dumb money in Hollywood.
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:52.320]  Yeah.
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:54.120]  That Eddy Cue is the most important guy,
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:57.020]  but he's the person you bring your project to first
[01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:58.440]  because he may pay the most.
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:17:59.520]  Right.
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:01.720]  Which isn't really a ringing endorsement.
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:04.980]  And again, they'll probably sort that over time.
[01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:06.540]  I mean, Amazon is also a dumb money.
[01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:10.480]  They're burning money on this Lord of the Rings prequel,
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:12.040]  which doesn't exist yet.
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:15.000]  And it's sort of astonishing that they've been at video
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.040]  for so long and really have not made a ton of progress.
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:22.000]  But again, Amazon can afford to screw around
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.240]  and not get it right for a long time, so can Apple.
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:27.040]  Netflix is getting it right.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.240]  They're still spending $3 billion a year more
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:33.320]  than they're bringing in to finance all this stuff.
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:34.200]  Right.
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:35.720]  But Wall Street's okay with it.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:37.400]  And then, but for these other companies
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:41.020]  that are in the middle where it is their core business,
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:43.640]  but it's unclear how much they're gonna be able
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.860]  to throw at that, that's the real question mark.
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:47.860]  And it's weird to talk about the company
[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:50.260]  that used to be called Time Warner being sort of
[01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:55.160]  in the middle of the tier of giant media companies,
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:57.400]  but that's kind of where they are right now.
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:58.460]  That's a good way to wrap up.
[01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:00.520]  Thank you, Peter, Kafka.
[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:04.080]  Anything else you wanted to talk about?
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:06.360]  I'm delighted to be on the internet with you, John.
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:07.200]  Thank you for having me.
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:10.320]  Let me thank our sponsors, Mack Weldon and Linode,
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:14.400]  and everybody can catch Peter's own podcast, Recode Media,
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:16.880]  just on your favorite podcast player.
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:19.720]  Oh, oh, I'll plug something I already did.
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:22.020]  My colleague and I, Ronnie Mola, did a seven-part series
[01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:23.920]  on Netflix called Land of the Giants,
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:24.820]  which you can also get
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:26.700]  where you hear your favorite podcast.
[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:28.480]  So if you like hearing about Netflix and streaming,
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:30.400]  we've got seven episodes of that for you.
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:31.240]  Excellent.
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:32.500]  Thank you, Peter.
[01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:34.160]  Thank you, John.
