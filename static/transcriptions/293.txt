[00:00.000 --> 00:03.840]  How am I supposed to ruin my life as a middle-aged man right now?
[00:03.840 --> 00:12.200]  The way it's manifesting for me is a truly bizarre time compression.
[00:12.200 --> 00:14.120]  Yeah, I naturally have a pretty good sense of time.
[00:14.120 --> 00:18.640]  Like when I would do a talk on stage and maybe it's a 20-minute slot,
[00:18.640 --> 00:20.760]  I can hit 18 minutes in my head and I know what it is.
[00:20.760 --> 00:22.900]  It's like I got a pretty good internal clock,
[00:22.900 --> 00:25.880]  and yet I don't know what day it is,
[00:25.880 --> 00:30.760]  and I don't know what I have to look up at the menu bar to be.
[00:30.760 --> 00:32.640]  I definitely know the month plan.
[00:32.640 --> 00:37.920]  You know what I mean? That's just such a loss of grounding.
[00:37.920 --> 00:42.440]  It's a loss of grounding in that short-term of what day is it,
[00:42.440 --> 00:44.480]  and everybody's going through it.
[00:44.480 --> 00:48.120]  It's clearly shared, and yet at the same time,
[00:48.120 --> 00:53.680]  it's really exacerbating that longer-term, wait, really?
[00:53.680 --> 00:59.080]  It's 20 years since I started talking to Emile about stuff and reading his blog,
[00:59.080 --> 01:02.320]  and we'll get into it in a moment.
[01:02.320 --> 01:05.920]  I want to talk about it because it's the 25-year anniversary of Windows 95,
[01:05.920 --> 01:10.480]  and you wrote about it, and it's natural.
[01:10.480 --> 01:12.760]  We're mid-40s, and it's like, yeah,
[01:12.760 --> 01:14.640]  we do remember stuff from 25 years ago,
[01:14.640 --> 01:16.720]  and we were enthusiasts in the community,
[01:16.720 --> 01:20.040]  and I remember I didn't get in line because I didn't have a Windows PC,
[01:20.040 --> 01:23.640]  but I certainly remember reading about people getting in line to buy Windows 95,
[01:23.640 --> 01:25.920]  and it's like you remember this stuff,
[01:25.920 --> 01:27.120]  and a lot of the people,
[01:27.120 --> 01:30.960]  not like I have the youngest demographic,
[01:30.960 --> 01:35.480]  but I do realize there are people listening,
[01:35.480 --> 01:36.680]  and I do hear from them,
[01:36.680 --> 01:38.160]  and whenever I make jokes,
[01:38.160 --> 01:39.560]  they often write to me and say,
[01:39.560 --> 01:42.320]  no, I'm 18, and I love your podcast,
[01:42.320 --> 01:44.200]  and whatever, and I'm so glad.
[01:44.200 --> 01:46.320]  It makes me feel like I'm doing something right.
[01:46.320 --> 01:49.520]  No, I definitely shouldn't have an audience completely.
[01:49.520 --> 01:51.000]  You're relevant. You're pertinent.
[01:51.000 --> 01:54.280]  Yeah. I don't TikTok,
[01:54.280 --> 01:56.760]  but I know how to spell it.
[01:56.760 --> 02:00.040]  Oh, I would pay cash money to watch John Gruber on TikTok.
[02:00.040 --> 02:00.800]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:00.800 --> 02:03.360]  I want to see you do a lot of dances that's mostly your arms.
[02:03.360 --> 02:03.600]  Yeah.
[02:03.600 --> 02:07.040]  Gus, really. That's what I think is your strong suit.
[02:07.440 --> 02:11.400]  I have exactly as much rhythm as I look like I have.
[02:11.400 --> 02:13.800]  All right. I'm old-fashioned.
[02:13.800 --> 02:16.920]  I feel like when this is what old guys say,
[02:16.920 --> 02:18.400]  which is when I was young,
[02:18.400 --> 02:19.640]  I feel like when I was young,
[02:19.640 --> 02:22.320]  people would dance by moving their hips or their legs,
[02:22.320 --> 02:25.400]  but that doesn't fit in frame in a vertical video.
[02:25.400 --> 02:29.200]  It's just like dances are just from the elbows up.
[02:29.200 --> 02:35.920]  Yeah, that's me. Sorry, a little off time.
[02:35.920 --> 02:45.120]  No, but there's another thing
[02:45.120 --> 02:48.400]  that somebody we're going to talk about another thing on my show notes to talk about later
[02:48.400 --> 02:56.760]  is somebody's observation that Mosaic happened 10 years after the Macintosh debuted.
[02:56.760 --> 03:02.680]  And there's a part of me that is like, no.
[03:02.680 --> 03:06.160]  So we're talking about the App Store.
[03:06.160 --> 03:08.120]  Unlike most episodes of my show,
[03:08.120 --> 03:09.960]  this one has an index.
[03:09.960 --> 03:12.360]  All right. We got subjects.
[03:12.360 --> 03:16.600]  Or an index comes at the end, I guess a table of contents.
[03:17.880 --> 03:22.840]  But we're talking about the App Store 12 years into the iPhone era, right?
[03:22.840 --> 03:27.440]  And we all have this timeline burned into this or 13 years,
[03:27.440 --> 03:29.320]  I guess, into the iPhone era,
[03:29.320 --> 03:32.120]  but 12 years into the App Store era.
[03:32.120 --> 03:34.280]  And okay, that's 12,
[03:34.280 --> 03:36.400]  13 years and here's where we are.
[03:36.400 --> 03:41.880]  Things have changed and that's the shifting of the whole world underfoot
[03:41.880 --> 03:44.760]  is sort of where everything is in conflict now, right?
[03:44.760 --> 03:49.040]  Plates have shifted and now there's fault lines that are exposed.
[03:49.040 --> 03:52.240]  And all right, historical context,
[03:52.240 --> 03:58.440]  Mosaic and graphical user interface web browsing came 10 years after the original Macintosh.
[03:58.440 --> 04:02.000]  And it's like, no, that doesn't make sense that that was only 10 years
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.240]  to go all the way from a black and white nine inch computer.
[04:06.240 --> 04:09.520]  That's so interesting because I think of it as, oh, was it that long?
[04:09.520 --> 04:13.080]  Because I have this time compression and this is, I think, speaking to that point about like,
[04:13.080 --> 04:15.960]  everything is through this sort of funhouse mirror of either
[04:15.960 --> 04:18.040]  that had to have been much longer or much less, right?
[04:18.040 --> 04:19.720]  So, you're feeling it's much less.
[04:19.720 --> 04:23.240]  I'm like, oh, those are of a moment to me.
[04:23.240 --> 04:24.080]  Those are connected.
[04:24.080 --> 04:28.480]  That's still when every day I was downloading new software and trying new things.
[04:28.480 --> 04:30.960]  So, I feel like there's a straight line.
[04:30.960 --> 04:34.720]  Like my first view of the web was on Next, where it was born.
[04:34.720 --> 04:37.640]  And that was probably in 93, 94.
[04:37.640 --> 04:41.600]  And I was using the app called World Wide Web, like Tim Berners-Lee's first app.
[04:41.600 --> 04:46.200]  And that was very much, and that was actually the first time I had access to a Next computer.
[04:46.200 --> 04:48.600]  It was like in a university computer lab.
[04:48.600 --> 04:51.160]  Like they were way too rich for my blood.
[04:51.160 --> 04:54.320]  Like I couldn't, I literally, I could see one in a magazine that was about it.
[04:54.320 --> 04:56.240]  But that was like the access to the machine.
[04:56.240 --> 05:02.760]  But to me, that was also what I think a lot of the perception still was, this is the next Apple, right?
[05:02.760 --> 05:05.160]  Like Jobs explicitly called it Next, right?
[05:05.160 --> 05:07.720]  This is the next big thing, and Next is the next Apple.
[05:07.720 --> 05:12.640]  And so this is my view, just like the first time I saw a Mac at a friend's house.
[05:12.640 --> 05:15.320]  Again, too rich for my blood, but like I could go and use one.
[05:15.320 --> 05:18.200]  I think it was exactly that sense of like, this is the next computer.
[05:18.200 --> 05:21.720]  So I saw this very much as the era of like, well, there's still new stuff.
[05:21.720 --> 05:24.360]  And actually all the way up until Windows 95, it was like there was new stuff.
[05:24.360 --> 05:27.520]  And I think after that, it was like, oh, we're just going to have software in our lives.
[05:27.520 --> 05:32.080]  They're not going to have, well, you go from a black and white computer or a color computer.
[05:32.080 --> 05:35.920]  Like very obviously an upgrade, like Color TV was.
[05:35.920 --> 05:43.560]  And sort of when you went from a standalone computer to a connected computer that's on the internet, that's very obviously an upgrade.
[05:43.560 --> 05:46.000]  But after that, it was just like improvements in kind.
[05:46.000 --> 05:51.600]  It wasn't, here's a new category of thing to have in your, on your desk.
[05:51.600 --> 05:56.520]  Let me take a break and thank our first sponsor, Eero.
[05:56.520 --> 05:58.720]  Look, these days, your house isn't just your home.
[05:58.720 --> 05:59.520]  It's an office.
[05:59.520 --> 06:00.800]  It's a school.
[06:00.800 --> 06:01.680]  It's a movie theater.
[06:01.680 --> 06:03.040]  It's a restaurant.
[06:03.040 --> 06:04.520]  Everything, really.
[06:04.520 --> 06:05.840]  They put a strain on your Wi-Fi.
[06:05.840 --> 06:09.720]  It's not good enough if it's only good in a room or two or maybe on one floor.
[06:09.720 --> 06:14.920]  You need solid Wi-Fi throughout your whole house so everyone isn't working on top of each other.
[06:14.920 --> 06:17.000]  You need Eero.
[06:17.000 --> 06:23.120]  Eero, an Amazon company, covers your whole home with fast, reliable Wi-Fi inside and out.
[06:23.120 --> 06:27.800]  Rooms with bad or no Wi-Fi dropouts on your patio or your roof deck.
[06:27.800 --> 06:33.760]  Eero makes every square foot of your house usable by eliminating poor coverage and dead spots.
[06:33.760 --> 06:37.840]  You'll have a consistently strong signal wherever you need it.
[06:37.840 --> 06:39.160]  You can be on a work call.
[06:39.160 --> 06:43.400]  Your kids can be remote learning and someone can be streaming videos all at the same time
[06:43.400 --> 06:46.560]  without any buffering when you have Eero.
[06:46.560 --> 06:51.240]  Eero is fast and easy to set up and super easy to manage.
[06:51.240 --> 06:54.840]  You just plug it into your modem and boom, you're good to go.
[06:54.840 --> 06:57.520]  The app runs on your phone.
[06:57.520 --> 06:59.080]  It is a terrific app.
[06:59.080 --> 07:00.320]  It really shows you everything.
[07:00.320 --> 07:05.560]  It even lets you run speed tests to test your outside network connection right in the app.
[07:05.560 --> 07:12.160]  You can see all of the devices that are connected to your network and it's just a terrific app.
[07:12.160 --> 07:16.640]  And for a limited time, you can get up to 20% off selected Eero models.
[07:16.640 --> 07:18.000]  We run it here.
[07:18.000 --> 07:21.680]  Only problem we had recently, the other day, a couple of problems, a couple of hiccups.
[07:21.680 --> 07:23.000]  Turned out what happened.
[07:23.000 --> 07:28.360]  Our Roomba ran into the power plug, knocked the Eero out of the wall behind a piece of
[07:28.360 --> 07:30.400]  furniture here in our living room.
[07:30.400 --> 07:34.440]  That's the only problem we've had with Eero in months and months and months was when it
[07:34.440 --> 07:36.680]  actually got pulled out of the wall.
[07:36.680 --> 07:38.040]  That's how reliable it is.
[07:38.040 --> 07:39.440]  It's really terrific.
[07:39.440 --> 07:45.280]  You're hearing me right now talk to you over a connection on Eero.
[07:45.280 --> 07:51.340]  Anyway, you can get up to 20% off select Eero models.
[07:51.340 --> 07:59.080]  Go to Eero, E-E-R-O dot com slash the talk show and enter code the talk show at checkout
[07:59.080 --> 08:02.520]  and you can get free next day shipping with your order.

[08:17.800 --> 08:19.920]  My thanks to Eero for sponsoring the show.
[08:19.920 --> 08:25.080]  So we were talking about that, you were talking about that, whether you think it was a long
[08:25.080 --> 08:28.040]  time from the original Mac to Netscape.
[08:28.040 --> 08:36.840]  I think it was a long time in my mind because to me, those early Macs in that 1984, 85,
[08:36.840 --> 08:40.120]  I didn't see, I forget how old I was when I first saw a Mac, but probably not until
[08:40.120 --> 08:47.020]  like 86, 87 maybe in school, but I'd read about it.
[08:47.020 --> 08:53.200]  This is also, this is so bizarre that I felt like when I did first get my hands on one,
[08:53.200 --> 08:59.400]  I felt a lot more familiar than I had any right to be because I had vacuumed issues
[08:59.400 --> 09:04.560]  of like Mac world magazine into my head without ever having seen a Macintosh even in like
[09:04.560 --> 09:07.240]  a store because that's pretty normal, right?
[09:07.240 --> 09:10.800]  I think I think the eighties in context, not just for computers, but everything, right?
[09:10.800 --> 09:14.920]  Like you, you would sort of vicariously get something through a magazine or through reading
[09:14.920 --> 09:18.400]  the newspaper and that was your only consumption of it, right?
[09:18.400 --> 09:24.120]  So if we, you know, you don't have a DVR, let alone video on demand or whatever.
[09:24.120 --> 09:29.440]  Then you either watch the TV show live or you would read a magazine writing about a
[09:29.440 --> 09:33.440]  TV show that had happened in the past that you could never see again, right?
[09:33.440 --> 09:37.360]  And so like, this is your only, this is your only lens on, on culture.
[09:37.360 --> 09:40.800]  And I'm just very distinctly, like I was a kid and we went for a good while.
[09:40.800 --> 09:44.520]  We visited India and like, you know, totally offline and no electricity, no running water.
[09:44.520 --> 09:49.640]  You come back and just reading magazines and be like, I wonder what happened in these interceding
[09:49.640 --> 09:53.900]  months in the world, like, and the world for me was, you know, what, what's the latest
[09:53.900 --> 09:57.660]  Michael Jackson video or what, you know, whatever, what's, what's, what's happened, you know,
[09:57.660 --> 09:59.680]  what was this movie Top Gun about?
[09:59.680 --> 10:00.680]  And that was it.
[10:00.680 --> 10:04.280]  And so like, you could consume all of culture this way and computers were no different because
[10:04.280 --> 10:11.360]  it was, that was the way to find out, you know, again, no app store, there's software
[10:11.360 --> 10:12.360]  and you should try it.
[10:12.360 --> 10:15.320]  The reviewer has told you authoritatively, this is what you do.
[10:15.320 --> 10:20.840]  So that was, I think, a completely reasonable way to form an opinion of and get familiar
[10:20.840 --> 10:25.040]  with a, a computer, any kind of technology.
[10:25.040 --> 10:30.460]  And I definitely, I mean, I read, I remember reading the manual to the Commodore 64 before
[10:30.460 --> 10:35.120]  we had one, we had a VIC-20 and we went to, they had computer clubs back in the day and
[10:35.120 --> 10:38.940]  we would meet in some like community center room at the mall.
[10:38.940 --> 10:44.120]  And there were guys that had Commodore 64s, which were then new and I didn't have one.
[10:44.120 --> 10:45.440]  And they were like, oh, we got an extra manual.
[10:45.440 --> 10:46.440]  You can buy a manual.
[10:46.440 --> 10:48.880]  And it was probably like $4 or something.
[10:48.880 --> 10:51.900]  And they were big, you know, computer manuals were like an inch, two inches thick.
[10:51.900 --> 10:54.320]  And I read it, I didn't have the computer.
[10:54.320 --> 10:55.320]  It was four.
[10:55.320 --> 10:59.200]  Because you're like, this is, this is fan fiction about a device I would like to own
[10:59.200 --> 11:00.200]  someday.
[11:00.200 --> 11:01.840]  That's, that was me.
[11:01.840 --> 11:08.620]  So I've told this story before, but it's so good and so informative that I feel like I
[11:08.620 --> 11:09.620]  cannot tell it enough.
[11:09.620 --> 11:15.160]  I didn't own a personal computer growing up because, and I had a lot of friends who had
[11:15.160 --> 11:16.960]  trouble getting one too.
[11:16.960 --> 11:20.840]  And all of my friends, the basic story was that their parents didn't want to spend all
[11:20.840 --> 11:25.640]  that money on a computer and you're not going to, you're never going to use it or you're
[11:25.640 --> 11:28.480]  only going to use it for games.
[11:28.480 --> 11:35.100]  And my parents, my parents' argument was if we buy you a computer, you're never going
[11:35.100 --> 11:38.160]  to leave the house.
[11:38.160 --> 11:39.160]  And they were right.
[11:39.160 --> 11:40.160]  And they were right.
[11:40.160 --> 11:46.120]  I, it's very, it is, and it was so maddening because I'm like, I cannot believe that this
[11:46.120 --> 11:50.120]  is the reason you won't buy me this thing that I desperately want is that you think
[11:50.120 --> 11:51.600]  I'll use it too much.
[11:51.600 --> 11:53.560]  Yes, that's exactly right.
[11:53.560 --> 12:00.420]  And in hindsight, I don't know, like there was a long time where I was very angry.
[12:00.420 --> 12:01.420]  And that continues to this point.
[12:01.420 --> 12:06.440]  But we did have, you know, we had an Atari 2600, it wasn't like we were a Luddite family,
[12:06.440 --> 12:11.760]  you know, we were, you know, we had the 2600, which I loved and played obsessively, and
[12:11.760 --> 12:16.760]  I had access to computers at schools.
[12:16.760 --> 12:25.920]  But it, there was also this huge divide, even at the time, like the 2600, I think was like,
[12:25.920 --> 12:28.120]  maybe like 100 bucks, 120 bucks.
[12:28.120 --> 12:32.920]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it was like, famously $89, I think was their big price cut for like
[12:32.920 --> 12:33.920]  Christmas or something.
[12:33.920 --> 12:40.680]  But you know, and in a way that it hasn't changed, you know, 25 or more, I guess, right,
[12:40.680 --> 12:46.880]  it's almost four years later, the games were expensive, the cartridges were very expensive,
[12:46.880 --> 12:49.280]  relative to the cost of the game.
[12:49.280 --> 12:55.400]  And then towards the tail end of the 2600 era, like at the, you know, at the time when
[12:55.400 --> 13:03.240]  like a million ED cartridges were being secretly buried in the ground, dumped in a hole in
[13:03.240 --> 13:07.560]  the ground somewhere, just buried in a ravine.
[13:07.560 --> 13:13.760]  Like other companies had backwards engineered the format, and you could get like off brand
[13:13.760 --> 13:17.680]  Atari games from a company you'd never heard of for $5.
[13:17.680 --> 13:19.800]  And it would be like, did you have Boscov's?
[13:19.800 --> 13:20.800]  I know you're from Pennsylvania.
[13:20.800 --> 13:23.760]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I grew up outside of Harrisburg, and we definitely
[13:23.760 --> 13:24.760]  have Boscov's.
[13:24.760 --> 13:28.840]  So sure, they had the clearance bin, and they had to like, yeah, yeah, yeah, the generic
[13:28.840 --> 13:30.960]  store brand, the Atari cart.
[13:30.960 --> 13:34.640]  Yeah, so Boscov's started in Redding, Pennsylvania, where I'm from.
[13:34.640 --> 13:36.640]  So we had like four Boscov's.
[13:36.640 --> 13:37.640]  The pride of Redding.
[13:37.640 --> 13:38.640]  Yeah, the pride of Redding.
[13:38.640 --> 13:39.640]  We had four Boscov's.
[13:39.640 --> 13:44.800]  Amy's grandmother knew Albert Boscov.
[13:44.800 --> 13:47.640]  It had not occurred to me that of course there would be a Boscov family.
[13:47.640 --> 13:48.800]  Oh, yeah, Albert Boscov.
[13:48.800 --> 13:49.800]  Yeah, sure.
[13:49.800 --> 13:52.520]  Yeah, and he's exactly, he's exactly what you think.
[13:52.520 --> 13:55.920]  He's, you know, he was like, I don't know if he was from Russia, exactly, but he was
[13:55.920 --> 13:56.920]  an immigrant.
[13:56.920 --> 14:00.600]  Yeah, he was an immigrant and started a store and employed half of them.
[14:00.600 --> 14:01.600]  And then Amazon killed it.
[14:01.600 --> 14:02.600]  Yeah.
[14:02.600 --> 14:04.820]  But that's the American dream.
[14:04.820 --> 14:09.280]  But Boscov's, I mean, again, it's like there's a very small segment of the audience who's
[14:09.280 --> 14:12.920]  like screaming like, yeah, Boscov's there, yeah.
[14:12.920 --> 14:13.920]  And everybody else is like, what?
[14:13.920 --> 14:15.080]  There used to be a department store.
[14:15.080 --> 14:16.080]  It's a department store.
[14:16.080 --> 14:17.720]  Boscov's is still around.
[14:17.720 --> 14:21.160]  I don't, I think I'm sure it's a shell of its former self, but Boscov's was a weird
[14:21.160 --> 14:26.960]  department store where they were, how would you describe it?
[14:26.960 --> 14:28.760]  It wasn't a discount store.
[14:28.760 --> 14:31.480]  It was, no, it was, it was actually, I think it was supposed to be like a sort of a little
[14:31.480 --> 14:32.840]  bit of prestige premium.
[14:32.840 --> 14:37.660]  It wasn't quite like Macy's or whatever it was trying to be, you know, I think central
[14:37.660 --> 14:43.040]  Pennsylvania did not lend itself to Macy's for a lot of reasons, culturally and economically,
[14:43.040 --> 14:48.000]  but they were like aspirational and they were early on, we're going to have technology.
[14:48.000 --> 14:53.320]  We're going to have, you know, at that time it was component stereos and high-fi and whatever.
[14:53.320 --> 14:56.160]  But then definitely, yeah, they had a computer section.
[14:56.160 --> 14:57.160]  Yeah.
[14:57.160 --> 15:01.440]  And they, you know, I'm going to say it was like roughly JC, it was regional, but like
[15:01.440 --> 15:05.760]  JC pennies tier prestige wise, you know?
[15:05.760 --> 15:06.760]  Yeah.
[15:06.760 --> 15:13.080]  But also had weird stuff like their toy department was at least ours was massive compared to
[15:13.080 --> 15:14.720]  what you expect at a store.
[15:14.720 --> 15:15.720]  Yeah.
[15:15.720 --> 15:16.720]  I got all my transformers.
[15:16.720 --> 15:17.720]  Yeah.
[15:17.720 --> 15:21.620]  And they had Atari cartridges too at the tail end that didn't even come in a box.
[15:21.620 --> 15:25.720]  They were in, um, like just like a sandwich bag.
[15:25.720 --> 15:27.280]  You had loose cartridges.
[15:27.280 --> 15:35.000]  They were in a sandwich bag with like a piece of cardboard on top stapled and then just
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.040]  hung on a pegboard.
[15:37.040 --> 15:38.040]  You know?
[15:38.040 --> 15:39.040]  That sounds bootleg.
[15:39.040 --> 15:42.720]  That sounds like you had it like a, that's like drug dealer game cartridges.
[15:42.720 --> 15:46.360]  Maybe, but you could get them cheap and they, and they definitely, you know, I think that
[15:46.360 --> 15:49.040]  there was something fishy, but that was exciting, right?
[15:49.040 --> 15:50.040]  That's it.
[15:50.040 --> 15:51.040]  Wow.
[15:51.040 --> 15:52.040]  Yeah.
[15:52.040 --> 15:53.040]  Yeah.
[15:53.040 --> 15:54.040]  No, that sounds, I mean, that's so scandalous.
[15:54.040 --> 15:55.040]  It would feel like you're getting away with something.
[15:55.040 --> 15:58.840]  Like the idea, and this sort of goes to the app store point is like, software was a physical
[15:58.840 --> 15:59.840]  thing in our lives.
[15:59.840 --> 16:00.840]  Right.
[16:00.840 --> 16:01.840]  And it was a box on the software.
[16:01.840 --> 16:08.400]  It was apparently a baggie at the store, but that's, that is so, my gosh, that's, it's
[16:08.400 --> 16:09.400]  depraved.
[16:09.400 --> 16:13.560]  I like, I just, I love how it like, that definitely feels like the kid at school in the corner
[16:13.560 --> 16:18.360]  of the playground, like opens up his coat and slides out a video game cartridge and
[16:18.360 --> 16:21.800]  like don't tell anybody like that seems like how you're getting your cartridge.
[16:21.800 --> 16:24.680]  But then you talked about like ET and so this is, this is a famous story.
[16:24.680 --> 16:27.960]  People can Google it, but like they, they, they over, they over created, they built,
[16:27.960 --> 16:31.360]  they made too many of these cartridges for this game that wasn't very good.
[16:31.360 --> 16:32.760]  And then they buried them in the desert.
[16:32.760 --> 16:38.220]  I think the Verge did a story on this and, and the thing I love about this is imagine
[16:38.220 --> 16:44.740]  you make an app and it doesn't succeed and lots of them don't, and you have to live with,
[16:44.740 --> 16:48.360]  they will physically take the remains of your app and bury it in the desert.
[16:48.360 --> 16:52.680]  Like that's so much more final than like, than just the, like you check your app sales
[16:52.680 --> 16:56.280]  charts and all, I only moved three copies today and I guess I'm not going to make it
[16:56.280 --> 16:57.280]  go with this.
[16:57.280 --> 17:00.840]  Like, like what, what, like such a definitive failure where they're like, we have to hide
[17:00.840 --> 17:03.280]  your shame in a hole in the ground.
[17:03.280 --> 17:06.680]  But in a sense though, yeah, that's interesting, right?
[17:06.680 --> 17:12.160]  Like wouldn't it be, wouldn't you feel better if like movable type 4.0 or 5.0 was somewhere
[17:12.160 --> 17:15.460]  in the, you know, and there were a million copies in the desert, there was something,
[17:15.460 --> 17:16.460]  you know what I mean?
[17:16.460 --> 17:17.460]  Yeah.
[17:17.460 --> 17:18.460]  Yeah.
[17:18.460 --> 17:19.460]  Yeah.
[17:19.460 --> 17:22.540]  I mean the stuff that I was doing like 15, 20 years ago, there's some tangible artifacts
[17:22.540 --> 17:26.680]  of and it's like, it's, but it's like swag, like it's like, Oh, we had a USB memory stick
[17:26.680 --> 17:31.600]  or something, or we had a t-shirt or something, but, but, but I definitely, you know, I still
[17:31.600 --> 17:32.600]  hold onto it.
[17:32.600 --> 17:37.320]  When, when at Glitch we, we, you know, we redid our office and, and we had a conference
[17:37.320 --> 17:43.600]  room and I put up, we have a box of the original HyperCard, which was a huge influence on Glitch.
[17:43.600 --> 17:49.360]  We have the original windows 95 CD-ROM, we have a mist on CD-ROM, like all these different
[17:49.360 --> 17:53.680]  sort of classic Lotus one, two, three, you know, PhysiCalc, what I would think of this
[17:53.680 --> 17:57.840]  sort of the canon of software and I got the physical copies and then I wanted, one of
[17:57.840 --> 18:03.840]  the later ones I wanted to add was Portal, the video game, you know, from Valve.
[18:03.840 --> 18:07.360]  And cause I, and I was like, Oh, you know, like, can we, can we get, cause it got most
[18:07.360 --> 18:10.680]  of the stuff off of eBay and it's actually, it's actually not, it is not at all expensive
[18:10.680 --> 18:14.160]  to collect vintage software as it turns out.
[18:14.160 --> 18:19.240]  And our, our, you know, my coworker was like, Oh, we can't get Portal.
[18:19.240 --> 18:20.240]  And I was like, Oh, why not?
[18:20.240 --> 18:21.240]  Like, why don't we?
[18:21.240 --> 18:26.560]  And he's like, it was never released on a CD, but it was, had to be like orange, but
[18:26.560 --> 18:30.280]  he's like, there's a bundle with like 10 other games, like in a clearance bin, but
[18:30.280 --> 18:31.600]  like there is no package for it.
[18:31.600 --> 18:33.920]  And I was like, Oh, that must've been just after the end.
[18:33.920 --> 18:36.800]  And obviously the company that makes Steam is going to be, you know, the one that's going
[18:36.800 --> 18:40.960]  to be the first to move to digital, but, but it was such a, I was like, Oh, that's, that's,
[18:40.960 --> 18:45.400]  that's first step into too late for there being a physical artifact to, to software.
[18:45.400 --> 18:49.720]  Cause I loved, you know, I was that kid when, as a music fan, reading the liner notes on
[18:49.720 --> 18:53.760]  every album and, and, and I loved that feel with software, like on the, you know, the
[18:53.760 --> 18:58.400]  old Microsoft packages, they would have the floppy disks in a, in a little plastic bag
[18:58.400 --> 19:00.040]  that had like a perforation on it.
[19:00.040 --> 19:01.040]  That was incredibly satisfying.
[19:01.040 --> 19:05.460]  Like it, it got the feel that like unboxing something really great does, you know, these
[19:05.460 --> 19:08.800]  days where they really, I don't think it was intentional back then, but they had just had
[19:08.800 --> 19:13.760]  gotten this, like the tactile feel of what you do to, to re unleash this product was
[19:13.760 --> 19:18.440]  really gratifying and, and, and that was such an interesting thing because that, that obviously
[19:18.440 --> 19:19.440]  was a lost art.
[19:19.440 --> 19:23.680]  By the time it was just like, we'll throw a CD in a regular joke case or evidently throw
[19:23.680 --> 19:24.680]  a cartridge in a baggy.
[19:24.680 --> 19:25.680]  Yeah.
[19:25.680 --> 19:28.080]  It was just sort of like, well, we have to give it to you on a disc because there's no
[19:28.080 --> 19:31.680]  other way to deliver this many, you know, what are you going to do?
[19:31.680 --> 19:34.240]  Suck this down on a 56 K modem.
[19:34.240 --> 19:37.640]  So we have to, we have to give you a couple of discs.
[19:37.640 --> 19:38.640]  Here you go.
[19:38.640 --> 19:43.720]  You know, and they're just the pure, you know, um, well, my, my boss,
[19:43.720 --> 19:48.160]  ask of story is this, is that, uh, so we had, we were at 2,600 family.
[19:48.160 --> 19:50.680]  I, I had friends with Apple twos.
[19:50.680 --> 19:51.920]  Our school had Apple twos.
[19:51.920 --> 19:56.360]  I was very familiar with the Apple two platform and that's desperately what I wanted, but
[19:56.360 --> 20:02.800]  I had friends with Commodores, uh, friends with, I mean, again, the idea that there was
[20:02.800 --> 20:08.480]  a, it just seems so natural that there were so many completely rival computing platforms,
[20:08.480 --> 20:10.480]  Texas instruments, the trashy.
[20:10.480 --> 20:16.240]  Um, and in fact, it was not likely you would know somebody else with the same system as
[20:16.240 --> 20:20.320]  you, like one friend who had a Commodore and everybody else was lazy said that there was
[20:20.320 --> 20:25.440]  a TI 99 four a, and there was an Apple two and it was like you had some stuff in common,
[20:25.440 --> 20:27.380]  but no interoperability whatsoever.
[20:27.380 --> 20:28.380]  Other than basic.
[20:28.380 --> 20:29.380]  Right.
[20:29.380 --> 20:33.120]  And is that you could get like a magazine, you could get a mic, a magazine with a basic
[20:33.120 --> 20:38.800]  program you could type in and it would probably work exactly as is on like a Commodore and
[20:38.800 --> 20:43.440]  an Apple and you didn't have to be a programming whiz to figure out if there was like maybe
[20:43.440 --> 20:47.440]  one thing that, you know, you had to change, like, Oh, that, you know, but for the most
[20:47.440 --> 20:48.440]  part it was the same.
[20:48.440 --> 20:54.040]  But I had a piece I was working on comparing today's app stores to what, you know, the
[20:54.040 --> 21:00.160]  sort of the experience was in 1984 say, and the idea of get in, uh, you get in your parents'
[21:00.160 --> 21:07.120]  car ride to a bookstore, which is a thing, go to the newsstand, go through the newsstand
[21:07.120 --> 21:12.920]  and find the magazine for your type of computer because there was a different variant, right?
[21:12.920 --> 21:19.400]  Then read the articles, flip to the back and pages and pages and pages of essentially machine
[21:19.400 --> 21:24.840]  code, and then transcribe it with no errors, typing in multiple pages of completely abstract
[21:24.840 --> 21:29.480]  code for usually a few days and then compile and it's a bug.
[21:29.480 --> 21:30.480]  It's wrong.
[21:30.480 --> 21:34.520]  You type something wrong, then spend a weekend debugging it, then get it all working.
[21:34.520 --> 21:38.440]  And if that all that works, all that, like the, the, that week of prep that you had spent
[21:38.440 --> 21:42.880]  works, you get this, this little game, little app, and you're like, okay, that's fine.
[21:42.880 --> 21:43.880]  That's it.
[21:43.880 --> 21:44.880]  Like, that's it.
[21:44.880 --> 21:45.880]  And it's impossible.
[21:45.880 --> 21:50.480]  Like it is, you would not believe it if it hadn't happened, like it is absurd to believe.
[21:50.480 --> 21:55.200]  And then, and then, and the, you know, just every aspect of that is this like completely
[21:55.200 --> 21:58.200]  tenuous, fragile thing that you're just like, please let this work.
[21:58.200 --> 21:59.200]  Please let this work.
[21:59.200 --> 22:06.360]  Cause the right, and sometimes you could get a clear, uh, you might get a clear error,
[22:06.360 --> 22:08.640]  like syntax error line 40, you know?
[22:08.640 --> 22:09.640]  Oh yeah.
[22:09.640 --> 22:10.640]  That was a blessing.
[22:10.640 --> 22:11.640]  Yeah.
[22:11.640 --> 22:13.120]  But, but you could just get something just, just plain dead silence.
[22:13.120 --> 22:14.120]  Yeah.
[22:14.120 --> 22:15.120]  I don't know what happened.
[22:15.120 --> 22:16.120]  Yeah.
[22:16.120 --> 22:17.480]  I have no idea where it went wrong.
[22:17.480 --> 22:21.360]  And it's, you just typed in three pages of stuff and you've just got to kind of eyeball
[22:21.360 --> 22:24.160]  it between this screen in front of you in a magazine.
[22:24.160 --> 22:28.160]  And, uh, yeah, it's like, no, I think I'd going to go back to getting hit by my older
[22:28.160 --> 22:31.880]  brother that was better, but this is, this is bad.
[22:31.880 --> 22:39.380]  The 1984 mag, which of course I wanted, but which I just wanted to see even was 25, $2,500
[22:39.380 --> 22:45.520]  in 1984 dollars, which is like a million dollars in today's dollars of no inflation calculator,
[22:45.520 --> 22:48.920]  but that sounds, they didn't sell things like that at Boscov's.
[22:48.920 --> 22:49.920]  You couldn't go.
[22:49.920 --> 22:50.920]  It wasn't a consumer.
[22:50.920 --> 22:52.600]  No, no, that was a special thing.
[22:52.600 --> 22:53.600]  Right.
[22:53.600 --> 22:59.400]  You could have stuff at Boscov's like, uh, other rival, uh, video home computer things
[22:59.400 --> 23:04.120]  like, um, you know, the Coleco, uh, vision or, uh, Intellivision.
[23:04.120 --> 23:08.640]  My uncle had, there was a, there was a category in between sort of game console and real computer
[23:08.640 --> 23:11.960]  where they had like a kind of a crappy keyboard, but it would do a little bit of both.
[23:11.960 --> 23:12.960]  Yeah.
[23:12.960 --> 23:16.600]  Um, but the one I remember desperately and God, this is, and it's the black hole that
[23:16.600 --> 23:20.460]  like maybe I might have to wait until I'm retired because if I start going down this
[23:20.460 --> 23:26.400]  hole now during fireball will collapse on upon itself is like collecting vintage computer
[23:26.400 --> 23:27.400]  stuff.
[23:27.400 --> 23:28.400]  Oh God.
[23:28.400 --> 23:31.200]  But the one that I loved was the Vectrex.
[23:31.200 --> 23:32.200]  Do you remember this?
[23:32.200 --> 23:36.420]  That was, yeah, that was a narrow, I mean that I remember it, but it was a visual.
[23:36.420 --> 23:37.420]  This makes sense.
[23:37.420 --> 23:38.420]  It's visually interesting.
[23:38.420 --> 23:40.160]  So that, that, that must've really spoken to you.
[23:40.160 --> 23:45.640]  I did the math, by the way, it's, it's 6,220, $20 for an original Mac.
[23:45.640 --> 23:46.640]  Right?
[23:46.640 --> 23:47.640]  So think about that.
[23:47.640 --> 23:48.640]  Think about if your kid, it's enormous.
[23:48.640 --> 23:49.640]  It's a car.
[23:49.640 --> 23:50.640]  It's a car.
[23:50.640 --> 23:51.640]  A car would cost that.
[23:51.640 --> 23:57.200]  Think about if your 11 year old kid came up to you and said, I would like a $6,700 computer.
[23:57.200 --> 24:00.080]  You got, you got $6,000 lying around, son.
[24:00.080 --> 24:01.080]  Yeah.
[24:01.080 --> 24:02.080]  Yeah.
[24:02.080 --> 24:05.880]  The Vectrex for those who don't know it, I'll put it in the show notes, but it was a self-contained,
[24:05.880 --> 24:10.000]  it was sort of like the Mac of video game consoles cause you had to play, it had a bill
[24:10.000 --> 24:11.080]  on like everything else.
[24:11.080 --> 24:14.360]  It didn't hook up to your TV because it was vector graph, had a screen built in.
[24:14.360 --> 24:15.360]  Yeah.
[24:15.360 --> 24:16.360]  And it's a special vector graph.
[24:16.360 --> 24:20.560]  Have you ever seen games like the old coin op star Wars game, which is my favorite of
[24:20.560 --> 24:24.520]  the genre, but asteroids was a thing.
[24:24.520 --> 24:30.840]  And instead of pixels, big fat dots on the screen, it drew lines on the screen and therefore
[24:30.840 --> 24:36.960]  a diagonal line would be just as straight as a horizontal or vertical line, which fascinated
[24:36.960 --> 24:37.960]  me.
[24:37.960 --> 24:41.520]  And I mean, in retrospect, they look jaggy, but the implementation was so good.
[24:41.520 --> 24:42.520]  Right.
[24:42.520 --> 24:46.440]  And I think one of the other things too is like the aesthetics of the early mid eighties
[24:46.440 --> 24:50.960]  vector graphics were, were the symbol of the future and the way that bitmap was not like
[24:50.960 --> 24:56.680]  now retroactively the, which was a little bit later, the eight bit graphics, like, you
[24:56.680 --> 25:02.160]  know, the, the Mario you know, icon with the blocky graphics is sort of the, that's the
[25:02.160 --> 25:05.360]  definitive eight bit image, right?
[25:05.360 --> 25:06.360]  Is that a Sprite?
[25:06.360 --> 25:07.360]  Yeah.
[25:07.360 --> 25:08.480]  And, but that was actually later, right?
[25:08.480 --> 25:14.040]  If you're in 1981, 82, 83 I think Blade Runner sort of captures this a little bit, certainly
[25:14.040 --> 25:18.840]  obviously in the, in, in star Wars, like in the new hope and they have the vector graphics
[25:18.840 --> 25:22.920]  drawing of the death star like that was what the future was.
[25:22.920 --> 25:29.760]  The future was this like vector outlined, maybe solid polyshaded Tron was that too.
[25:29.760 --> 25:32.020]  And that was like a symbol of futurism.
[25:32.020 --> 25:36.400]  And so I think like what you see in like your sort of graphical, I think Vectrex was this
[25:36.400 --> 25:39.680]  symbol of this is future computer, not just cause the screen is built in.
[25:39.680 --> 25:43.140]  Although that obviously it was also future because the Mac did that too.
[25:43.140 --> 25:49.840]  But like the way I think there was a visual language that showed fluidity, like motion
[25:49.840 --> 25:54.160]  without jaggies, whereas everything else was blocky as hell.
[25:54.160 --> 25:55.160]  Yeah.
[25:55.160 --> 25:59.320]  Uh, so I wanted to play the Vectrex so bad and I knew I was going to get one.
[25:59.320 --> 26:00.320]  There's no chance.
[26:00.320 --> 26:01.320]  Yeah.
[26:01.320 --> 26:02.320]  Parents are going to buy them.
[26:02.320 --> 26:06.360]  But, but Boscovs had one, they, they not only sold them, they had like a counter.
[26:06.360 --> 26:08.400]  Oh, you had a demo unit.
[26:08.400 --> 26:09.400]  Yeah.
[26:09.400 --> 26:11.960]  There was a demo unit, but it was always a kid in front of you.
[26:11.960 --> 26:16.240]  And I just remember I have this vivid memory of the one time there was nobody else in line
[26:16.240 --> 26:18.200]  behind the kid who was playing.
[26:18.200 --> 26:21.100]  And so I had, and my mom was shopping for whatever.
[26:21.100 --> 26:25.240]  So I had a chance if this kid in front of me would give it up, I'd have it, but I had
[26:25.240 --> 26:26.240]  to pee.
[26:26.240 --> 26:27.240]  Oh yeah.
[26:27.240 --> 26:30.480]  That's, you hate to, it's just the flesh is weak.
[26:30.480 --> 26:31.480]  We're mortals.
[26:31.480 --> 26:38.160]  So I did get to play for the first time, but I had to give it up and then run, run short
[26:38.160 --> 26:44.080]  restroom and sort of put a little dot in my jeans, you know, my tough skinned jeans before
[26:44.080 --> 26:45.080]  I got there.
[26:45.080 --> 26:48.200]  And then just peed like, peed like a race horse.
[26:48.200 --> 26:49.200]  That's very evocative.
[26:49.200 --> 26:50.920]  John, thank you for sharing that story.
[26:50.920 --> 26:52.040]  That's how desperate I was.
[26:52.040 --> 26:56.040]  That's how desperate I was for this, you know, for a higher resolution display.
[26:56.040 --> 27:02.760]  Yeah, but for, to my mind that, that 10 year period from the mid eighties to the mid nineties,
[27:02.760 --> 27:09.840]  to me, that's so long because like, to me, those, those mid 80 computers, including the,
[27:09.840 --> 27:14.800]  the original Mac, even though the, the interface was so new, it was so limited in terms of
[27:14.800 --> 27:23.760]  storage and they really, they cut every corner they could to get that all together, 128 kilobytes
[27:23.760 --> 27:26.120]  of memory, you know, disks.
[27:26.120 --> 27:27.120]  Yeah.
[27:27.120 --> 27:29.720]  I mean, but even that, like, I, I was trying to explain this, I think I was saying this
[27:29.720 --> 27:33.520]  on Twitter the other day, but like, you know, again, the big 20 first computer I had, there
[27:33.520 --> 27:38.320]  was a Commodore computer, and this was one of the very early sort of mainstream products
[27:38.320 --> 27:40.840]  and it had essentially 5k of RAM.
[27:40.840 --> 27:46.800]  And I was trying to explain to somebody a single emoji takes up 5k, like, like any,
[27:46.800 --> 27:51.800]  like a smiley that you have dropped in the end of an email as an emoji, that is more
[27:51.800 --> 27:53.320]  memory than the entire computer had.
[27:53.320 --> 27:54.720]  And people are like, that doesn't make any sense.
[27:54.720 --> 27:58.040]  Like, how would you put a, you know, software into that?
[27:58.040 --> 27:59.040]  Right.
[27:59.040 --> 28:01.120]  And it's like, well, that's what you have.
[28:01.120 --> 28:06.360]  There was a standard control in the original Mac for text edit fields.
[28:06.360 --> 28:10.880]  And there was an app called simple text, or I think originally, which was first teach
[28:10.880 --> 28:12.080]  text or simple text.
[28:12.080 --> 28:13.080]  I forget.
[28:13.080 --> 28:16.240]  I feel like simple text, but yeah, I think it was simple text first.
[28:16.240 --> 28:21.920]  And then teach text was the renamed version, but the files they, you know, and that was
[28:21.920 --> 28:26.120]  like what a readme would be formatted on, you know, it would be a teach text file and
[28:26.120 --> 28:29.840]  because everybody had it, it was the very, you know, it was the built in text editor.
[28:29.840 --> 28:37.800]  32 kilobytes was the maximum size of text, which was always a bit of a problem.
[28:37.800 --> 28:40.800]  You know, like you had to squeeze it in, you could squeeze it in there.
[28:40.800 --> 28:49.640]  But you know, I had Adam Angst, the publisher of tidbits on and for a while, the size of
[28:49.640 --> 28:55.480]  an episode or an issue of tidbits in the early days was still limited to 32 kilobytes because,
[28:55.480 --> 28:59.400]  you know, that it needed to be able to open it up, had to be able to open it up or view
[28:59.400 --> 29:02.620]  it in a text field.
[29:02.620 --> 29:04.960]  It's just, it was sort of like those early ones.
[29:04.960 --> 29:12.520]  They were, your mind, you couldn't, your mind can't hold 128 kilobytes of ones and zeros,
[29:12.520 --> 29:14.380]  but you can almost imagine it, right?
[29:14.380 --> 29:19.880]  It was like you could, your human mind could see it and sort of hold the scope of it.
[29:19.880 --> 29:24.440]  And by the mid nineties, computers were so powerful and you could have so many things
[29:24.440 --> 29:29.620]  running at once with the megabytes of Ram that you could have installed.
[29:29.620 --> 29:36.320]  And the 17 inch displays we had at the college newspaper, which were huge and you could see
[29:36.320 --> 29:37.680]  so much at once.
[29:37.680 --> 29:42.180]  And it just seemed so much more expansive than your mind, right?
[29:42.180 --> 29:43.180]  Like it seemed like,
[29:43.180 --> 29:48.720]  Yeah, I do think your, your, your mental capacity is this thing that in the changeover from,
[29:48.720 --> 29:52.120]  I think, you know, eighties computers feel a little bit analog still.
[29:52.120 --> 29:53.120]  Yeah.
[29:53.120 --> 29:54.120]  Right.
[29:54.120 --> 29:55.120]  And nineties computers don't.
[29:55.120 --> 29:58.400]  And I think, and I think what changed in that moment is obviously, you know, graphics interfaces
[29:58.400 --> 29:59.400]  come in and all those kinds of things.
[29:59.400 --> 30:03.960]  But also if you're a coder, the thing you're all trying to do is preserve state, stay in
[30:03.960 --> 30:04.960]  the flow.
[30:04.960 --> 30:08.460]  You're keeping the whole mental model of the app in your head, basically.
[30:08.460 --> 30:13.560]  And when you had such limited storage and capacity and capability, you could, you could
[30:13.560 --> 30:17.360]  pretty reasonably keep everything that was in the computer's mind in your mind, right.
[30:17.360 --> 30:20.880]  You know, and then all of a sudden sort of two things happen simultaneously.
[30:20.880 --> 30:24.020]  One obviously capacity and Moore's law and all that kind of stuff goes up really quickly,
[30:24.020 --> 30:25.980]  but also it's connected to everything else in the world.
[30:25.980 --> 30:28.180]  So all of a sudden any information can come in, right?
[30:28.180 --> 30:32.640]  If you're pulling things off the internet, you know, the, the, the nascent web, you don't
[30:32.640 --> 30:35.680]  know what's being rendered in your software.
[30:35.680 --> 30:37.720]  You don't know what's showing up on your device.
[30:37.720 --> 30:38.720]  Like it can be anything.
[30:38.720 --> 30:43.320]  It used to be whatever was on this floppy disk is what I am going to have to parse and
[30:43.320 --> 30:45.520]  handle and processes data.
[30:45.520 --> 30:51.480]  And rather it is like arbitrary information coming from strangers on the internet is going
[30:51.480 --> 30:54.000]  to be the thing that I have to make software and wrap around.
[30:54.000 --> 31:00.240]  And that, that was such a shift in the work of the programmer, the work of the creator.
[31:00.240 --> 31:04.280]  And I think it's actually very different then because there's still this, you know, this
[31:04.280 --> 31:06.200]  ethos I have where like, you know, it's a glitch.
[31:06.200 --> 31:07.800]  We make tools for people to make apps.
[31:07.800 --> 31:08.800]  Right.
[31:08.800 --> 31:13.800]  And, and I always look at you know, a digital audio workstation, what is somebody doing
[31:13.800 --> 31:18.920]  in pro tools or in garage band as an analog, or you look at Photoshop or, or, you know,
[31:18.920 --> 31:20.600]  final cut or premiere or whatever.
[31:20.600 --> 31:25.560]  And, and, and those are creative tools where you're, you're still actually basically trying
[31:25.560 --> 31:29.040]  to keep the entire state of your work in your head.
[31:29.040 --> 31:32.800]  And for Photoshop, it's easier if it's visual, if you're doing a film, you know, in final
[31:32.800 --> 31:36.320]  cut, that's actually, that's, that's, you're probably doing a scene at a time because that's
[31:36.320 --> 31:38.840]  about as much as you have capability for.
[31:38.840 --> 31:44.680]  But software went from, I think in that era before the sort of, you know, modern, what
[31:44.680 --> 31:49.120]  we think of as a development environment, whether it's Xcode or visual studio or whatever,
[31:49.120 --> 31:52.800]  you were, you were maintaining state in your head of the app that you were building of
[31:52.800 --> 31:56.320]  the software, the tool or whatever the program you were building.
[31:56.320 --> 32:00.680]  And then there's this big, big shift sort of post rise of the web and then post rise
[32:00.680 --> 32:06.400]  of these, what we now would call the integrated development environment, the IDEs is, you
[32:06.400 --> 32:09.160]  are just handling a flow of things coming towards you.
[32:09.160 --> 32:13.240]  You're almost, you're just, it's like the, the, the, the space invaders coming down to
[32:13.240 --> 32:15.920]  you in the video game, you're just sort of fighting off whenever it's coming inbound
[32:15.920 --> 32:16.920]  to your app.
[32:16.920 --> 32:17.920]  Trenton Larkin Yeah.
[32:17.920 --> 32:19.000]  And as a user, yeah.
[32:19.000 --> 32:26.400]  And it's sort of like, it was a very sudden inversion of pre-network, pre-internet or,
[32:26.400 --> 32:32.400]  you know, and, and, and the, the, the funnel part of the inversion, where you go from the
[32:32.400 --> 32:36.320]  part where you, we were desperate, where can I get more stuff from my computer?
[32:36.320 --> 32:37.320]  Right.
[32:37.320 --> 32:38.680]  I've, I've, I've mastered.
[32:38.680 --> 32:39.680]  Oh God.
[32:39.680 --> 32:40.680]  Yeah.
[32:40.680 --> 32:41.680]  Yeah.
[32:41.680 --> 32:42.680]  Yeah.
[32:42.680 --> 32:43.680]  Literally.
[32:43.680 --> 32:44.680]  Cause I'll go to the bookstore and type it in if I have to, but I need to get something
[32:44.680 --> 32:45.680]  from my computer.
[32:45.680 --> 32:46.680]  Trenton Larkin And I have all these floppy disks and I, I've,
[32:46.680 --> 32:47.680]  I know everything.
[32:47.680 --> 32:48.680]  I know every game I've played every game.
[32:48.680 --> 32:54.240]  I know every program I've, I know every file that I've got saved because I had to make
[32:54.240 --> 32:55.240]  it.
[32:55.240 --> 32:56.880]  I've mastered everything on my computer.
[32:56.880 --> 32:59.680]  Where can I get something more, right?
[32:59.680 --> 33:04.840]  That's the, the one end of this funnel where it was just, just this, you're alone in the
[33:04.840 --> 33:09.280]  desert looking for just one new thing to put on your computer.
[33:09.280 --> 33:13.860]  Then there's like the BBS dial up era where it's like, all of a sudden there's a bit of
[33:13.860 --> 33:17.740]  community and a bit of sharing and it was such a trickle, but it's there, but what a
[33:17.740 --> 33:19.680]  brief era in hindsight, right?
[33:19.680 --> 33:24.860]  It was so obviously transitional in retrospect, but at the time it felt like the world had
[33:24.860 --> 33:25.860]  opened up.
[33:25.860 --> 33:29.040]  And I think, I think there, I mean, this is the thing that connectivity and the internet
[33:29.040 --> 33:33.360]  did to every discipline over and over and over as we went from scarcity to abundance.
[33:33.360 --> 33:37.880]  And there's this intermediate stage that again, it's very brief, but the time feels so eye
[33:37.880 --> 33:38.880]  opening.
[33:38.880 --> 33:41.600]  And, and, you know, again, like I always think of music and I'm like, that's, that's sort
[33:41.600 --> 33:46.140]  of all my first love, but like the, the idea of like, you had your CD collection or your
[33:46.140 --> 33:50.320]  record collection and you would know the album cuts you didn't even like, cause that was
[33:50.320 --> 33:51.440]  what you had to listen to.
[33:51.440 --> 33:56.000]  So if you're like, I'm going to listen to, you know, whatever Steely Dan and you're like,
[33:56.000 --> 33:59.220]  this fourth song sucks, but I need to listen to it to get to the fifth song because we're
[33:59.220 --> 34:01.120]  sequentially accessing everything.
[34:01.120 --> 34:03.400]  So I know all the words to the song I don't even like.
[34:03.400 --> 34:04.400]  Right.
[34:04.400 --> 34:05.960]  And, and that is what happens in scarcity world.
[34:05.960 --> 34:06.960]  Right.
[34:06.960 --> 34:10.160]  Like nobody's listening through a playlist if they don't like four songs in a row on
[34:10.160 --> 34:13.720]  it now in abundance land, cause you can sort of push the button and like that's music,
[34:13.720 --> 34:14.720]  but that was true for film.
[34:14.720 --> 34:15.720]  That was true.
[34:15.720 --> 34:19.840]  Like, you know, definitely you wore out a VHS tape of a movie you were all, it was only
[34:19.840 --> 34:22.200]  a B minus to you, right?
[34:22.200 --> 34:23.200]  Because you had it.
[34:23.200 --> 34:27.160]  And then, and then that idea with like what your computer could do and what you could
[34:27.160 --> 34:32.280]  do with to access information, your computer, the BBS era, and this sort of, you know, for
[34:32.280 --> 34:36.360]  folks who weren't around then, like it, it sort of flowed fairly seamlessly, I think
[34:36.360 --> 34:40.720]  into the AOL or prodigy era where there were what were called dial up services on the,
[34:40.720 --> 34:44.380]  on the, on the, actually one of the things we were talking about, windows 95, Microsoft
[34:44.380 --> 34:49.440]  did the Microsoft network and, and, and, you know, there were these multiple, you know,
[34:49.440 --> 34:50.440]  they were like TV channels.
[34:50.440 --> 34:55.120]  I mean, the reason today we have a cable network called MSNBC is it was launched alongside
[34:55.120 --> 34:57.200]  MSN, the Microsoft network.
[34:57.200 --> 34:59.640]  This dial up service was going to have a TV component.
[34:59.640 --> 35:04.120]  I just explained this to my son who's 16.
[35:04.120 --> 35:05.120]  I just explained it.
[35:05.120 --> 35:06.120]  It doesn't make any sense.
[35:06.120 --> 35:07.120]  It doesn't make any sense.
[35:07.120 --> 35:10.920]  And I was like, and, and lo these many years later, they kept the name.
[35:10.920 --> 35:11.920]  They kept the name.
[35:11.920 --> 35:12.920]  Yeah.
[35:12.920 --> 35:15.920]  Everything's an artifact, but it's an artifact of a mental model of a moment.
[35:15.920 --> 35:16.920]  You know what I mean?
[35:16.920 --> 35:19.400]  Like in 1994, it seems eminently reasonable.
[35:19.400 --> 35:23.920]  You should have a dial up service and a television network that have the same name that makes
[35:23.920 --> 35:24.920]  perfect sense to you.
[35:24.920 --> 35:25.920]  Yeah.
[35:25.920 --> 35:26.920]  You know what I mean?
[35:26.920 --> 35:29.440]  Because you don't know how we're going to navigate from the old world to the new.
[35:29.440 --> 35:30.520]  And so you're just guessing.
[35:30.520 --> 35:32.120]  And, and, and I do think it's interesting.
[35:32.120 --> 35:36.560]  We have all these artifacts around us of, of, of this sort of, you know, this connection
[35:36.560 --> 35:40.880]  to, we can kind of tell what it's going to be like, but we don't really know.
[35:40.880 --> 35:43.560]  And, and I just really like that.
[35:43.560 --> 35:44.560]  That's so fascinating to me.
[35:44.560 --> 35:50.360]  And I think that that's actually, you know, going to the point about the app store.
[35:50.360 --> 35:53.280]  We were still in a scarcity model of software.
[35:53.280 --> 35:59.360]  You're going to buy software when we went from on a floppy disk to on a CD rom to maybe
[35:59.360 --> 36:04.560]  you download it to, uh, you know, you're probably always downloading it too.
[36:04.560 --> 36:06.420]  It's just a service that you connect to.
[36:06.420 --> 36:07.420]  You don't even pay for the service.
[36:07.420 --> 36:08.420]  It's just sponsored by ads.
[36:08.420 --> 36:13.040]  Like that whole continuum, you know, I think everything happened very, very gradually and
[36:13.040 --> 36:14.040]  unevenly.
[36:14.040 --> 36:15.280]  And you never have this like breakthrough moment.
[36:15.280 --> 36:21.040]  And the rare exception is, you know, the app store coming out where it was so obviously
[36:21.040 --> 36:22.040]  sort of punctuated.
[36:22.040 --> 36:24.880]  And, you know, I don't know if you want to jump into that, but I, there's so many thoughts
[36:24.880 --> 36:25.880]  I have about it.
[36:25.880 --> 36:26.880]  Not yet.
[36:26.880 --> 36:27.880]  Not yet.
[36:27.880 --> 36:28.880]  Hold it.
[36:28.880 --> 36:29.880]  Hold it.
[36:29.880 --> 36:30.880]  Yeah.
[36:30.880 --> 36:31.880]  Yeah.
[36:31.880 --> 36:32.880]  Yeah.
[36:32.880 --> 36:33.880]  Before I'll just say this.
[36:33.880 --> 36:40.440]  I think that with the 84 to 94 decade, it was really, and maybe it's a, I'm a little
[36:40.440 --> 36:41.440]  biased.
[36:41.440 --> 36:46.280]  Maybe not, but I think it was really a business transformation, right?
[36:46.280 --> 36:49.440]  It was work that changed so quick.
[36:49.440 --> 36:50.680]  It was totally.
[36:50.680 --> 36:57.460]  And in my two was buying, there wasn't like the home market in total was nothing compared
[36:57.460 --> 37:00.160]  to what comp like companies were all in.
[37:00.160 --> 37:02.040]  They were like, we have to have spreadsheets.
[37:02.040 --> 37:03.680]  We have to have word process, right?
[37:03.680 --> 37:08.080]  I love those early stories like talking, you know, when you hear like the story of Dan
[37:08.080 --> 37:15.800]  Brooklyn, uh, talking about the first time, you know, he had the idea for, um, visit calc,
[37:15.800 --> 37:16.800]  visit calc cheese.
[37:16.800 --> 37:17.800]  I was going to call it one, two, three.
[37:17.800 --> 37:20.640]  And that's, you know, I was like, no, one, two, three is way too new.
[37:20.640 --> 37:26.320]  And I remember the story, the story he tells of showing it to an accountant and the accountant
[37:26.320 --> 37:31.400]  was just like, you have no idea, you know, this, uh, you just turned my 40 hour week
[37:31.400 --> 37:32.400]  into like an hour.
[37:32.400 --> 37:33.400]  He goes, are you serious?
[37:33.400 --> 37:37.160]  And he's like, let me tell you, you know, it's like, this is all I do is add these numbers
[37:37.160 --> 37:38.640]  up and he's like, oh, really?
[37:38.640 --> 37:41.200]  Um, yeah, it's unfathomable.
[37:41.200 --> 37:44.400]  The increase in productivity and how quickly everybody embraced it.
[37:44.400 --> 37:50.500]  And my perspective, all I've ever done professionally before I did during fireball is I made websites
[37:50.500 --> 37:54.680]  and which of course didn't exist, couldn't have existed pre computer.
[37:54.680 --> 37:59.920]  I got paid to make websites and I did graphic design and the graphic design work.
[37:59.920 --> 38:07.280]  I did a lot in the late nineties, you know, typically wound up in print, but none of it.
[38:07.280 --> 38:14.820]  I never once I graduated college in 1996 and, and especially in the four years from 96 to
[38:14.820 --> 38:19.640]  around 2000 I did an awful lot of freelance work, graphic design professionally, you know,
[38:19.640 --> 38:25.720]  and, and doing a lot of it like, uh, all of it really as a freelancer going into different
[38:25.720 --> 38:26.720]  companies.
[38:26.720 --> 38:28.480]  I never once in hindsight, I realized this.
[38:28.480 --> 38:36.960]  I never once encountered pre Quark express illustrator, Photoshop, graphic design, you
[38:36.960 --> 38:38.560]  know, physical, physical copy.
[38:38.560 --> 38:39.560]  Never, never.
[38:39.560 --> 38:40.560]  Yeah.
[38:40.560 --> 38:41.560]  It just never ended.
[38:41.560 --> 38:44.920]  And the student newspaper where I learned all this at Drexel by, you know, when I first
[38:44.920 --> 38:53.000]  got there at 92 93 was all Quark illustrator, Photoshop, uh, print out to laser printer.
[38:53.000 --> 38:58.120]  And it's just, you know, we did send, we didn't send, even when I left in 96, we didn't transfer
[38:58.120 --> 39:01.400]  the paper to the printer who printed the newspaper digitally.
[39:01.400 --> 39:07.080]  We did print out, you know, for tabloid size things and paste board them up and hand them
[39:07.080 --> 39:08.080]  to the printer.
[39:08.080 --> 39:09.280]  And then they photo scan them in.
[39:09.280 --> 39:10.280]  Right.
[39:10.280 --> 39:14.600]  So you had an analog output, analog output, but, uh, everything else was digital.
[39:14.600 --> 39:17.460]  And I, in my professional life, I never once encountered it.
[39:17.460 --> 39:22.200]  And in hindsight, that's only, you know, the Macintosh only came out in 1984 and like the
[39:22.200 --> 39:24.640]  laser writer was only 86.
[39:24.640 --> 39:30.260]  So like the, you know, the 84 to 86 doesn't even count for revolutionizing the graphic
[39:30.260 --> 39:31.260]  design industry.
[39:31.260 --> 39:32.640]  Cause of what didn't happen yet.
[39:32.640 --> 39:33.640]  Right.
[39:33.640 --> 39:37.600]  So in like six years, you were also early on that you were early to have a fully digital
[39:37.600 --> 39:38.600]  career, right?
[39:38.600 --> 39:42.600]  You had peers that did do, you know, paste up work and physical print work.
[39:42.600 --> 39:43.600]  Right.
[39:43.600 --> 39:46.980]  And, and, and I sort of had the same experience where like my first job and then later my
[39:46.980 --> 39:51.120]  first company were like basically doing technology for construction companies.
[39:51.120 --> 39:52.920]  And then there were some exactly what you said.
[39:52.920 --> 39:57.360]  They had gone early to getting an IBM PC and they had, you know, whatever the spreadsheets
[39:57.360 --> 40:01.080]  were, Lotus one, two, three, and, um, and, and then you would, you know, in that era,
[40:01.080 --> 40:04.440]  it was like, okay, well, we're going to move to windows and we're going to upgrade to windows
[40:04.440 --> 40:07.800]  and that's going to be a new computer and a new printer and all that kind of stuff.
[40:07.800 --> 40:11.400]  Um, but, but I definitely had, I mean, this is actually, this is, this is one of those
[40:11.400 --> 40:15.400]  things where I tell people and they just don't believe me, but like, so I had, um, Mennonite,
[40:15.400 --> 40:20.480]  uh, come, uh, companies, uh, work people who were, were our clients and I sold computers
[40:20.480 --> 40:24.800]  to Mennonites and for, uh, people who are not in those communities, Mennonites, I think
[40:24.800 --> 40:29.740]  for outsiders are indistinguishable from Amish, uh, they, they wear the bonnets and, and,
[40:29.740 --> 40:35.480]  and definitely we had, you know, folks that, um, had, uh, the buggies and, and, and all
[40:35.480 --> 40:36.480]  that kind of stuff.
[40:36.480 --> 40:37.480]  They are plain folk.
[40:37.480 --> 40:41.200]  Um, and, but, but Mennonites are a little more willing to engage with, uh, the outside
[40:41.200 --> 40:44.080]  world, uh, and those regards then that Amish folks are.
[40:44.080 --> 40:46.640]  But anyway, the first time I ever, this is a true story.
[40:46.640 --> 40:54.520]  The first time I ever in person saw a original, uh, Mac, the 128K Mac, uh, was on the desk
[40:54.520 --> 40:59.880]  of a Mennonite construction company, uh, in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and, and they
[40:59.880 --> 41:04.280]  had bought one when it was new and they had had it all the way into what, and by then
[41:04.280 --> 41:08.120]  that plan has been in 91, 92, it was old, but they were like, well, it still works.
[41:08.120 --> 41:10.120]  We're not going to get rid of, you know, they, they are plain folks.
[41:10.120 --> 41:14.720]  They don't, they don't get rid of an implement that still works in the Mac still worked.
[41:14.720 --> 41:19.400]  Um, and, and it was so instructive because like, I mean, they were very extreme example,
[41:19.400 --> 41:24.880]  but a lot of these people were going from handwritten spreadsheets, literally like boxes
[41:24.880 --> 41:27.640]  on a piece of paper to a computer.
[41:27.640 --> 41:34.000]  And, and that idea of like that transformation of your life, where to the point about the
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.480]  accountant talking to Dan Bricklin, when he invents a spreadsheet, you are going to go
[41:37.480 --> 41:42.880]  from this being all you do all day to a trivial task that a computer can do for you.
[41:42.880 --> 41:46.960]  I think it's almost impossible to overstate and how jarring it must've been.
[41:46.960 --> 41:51.000]  Now, even if you're not like Amish or near Amish, like if you are just a regular person
[41:51.000 --> 41:55.640]  growing up in society, you, you, I think there's such anxiety around it.
[41:55.640 --> 41:57.920]  And I think that's actually the point about like, while you're talking about your parents
[41:57.920 --> 42:00.780]  being like, we don't want you to date a computer, you're going to spend all day with it.
[42:00.780 --> 42:04.920]  That's different than if I said, I wanted a guitar, my parents would not have said,
[42:04.920 --> 42:08.720]  Oh, you're going to spend all day inside on the guitar because that's, that's an instrument
[42:08.720 --> 42:10.200]  that is expression.
[42:10.200 --> 42:12.800]  That is, you know, that is an art form.
[42:12.800 --> 42:17.320]  And, and, and the reason I think that there was a really common attitude in those eras,
[42:17.320 --> 42:22.040]  and it's not so much true now, cause it would be absurd to be like, don't be on your phone,
[42:22.040 --> 42:25.240]  but that you would say, I don't want you to spend all day on the computer was there was
[42:25.240 --> 42:28.520]  a skepticism about technology as a whole.
[42:28.520 --> 42:29.520]  Right.
[42:29.520 --> 42:33.080]  And like I said, this is the era of Blade Runner, but it's also a war games, Matthew
[42:33.080 --> 42:37.520]  Broderick film, where he starts like a nuclear war with his home computer, shall we play
[42:37.520 --> 42:38.520]  a game?
[42:38.520 --> 42:39.520]  Exactly.
[42:39.520 --> 42:40.520]  Right.
[42:40.520 --> 42:44.920]  And there's this cultural anxiety about what are these machines doing to us?
[42:44.920 --> 42:46.200]  Are we losing our souls?
[42:46.200 --> 42:47.800]  Which seems quaint now.
[42:47.800 --> 42:48.800]  Right.
[42:48.800 --> 42:51.000]  Cause it's like, they were right actually about a lot of their concerns.
[42:51.000 --> 42:54.040]  There are books written in like 82, 83, and I'm forgetting the name of one of them, but
[42:54.040 --> 42:57.400]  I'll send you for the show notes if I can remember, but, but it was a fairly, fairly
[42:57.400 --> 42:58.400]  prominent book.
[42:58.400 --> 43:01.100]  It was like one of those, like, you know, the, the thinkers of the time are writing
[43:01.100 --> 43:04.120]  about, you know, obviously I was a child, so I wasn't thinking about the book, but I
[43:04.120 --> 43:06.960]  went back and looked at it and they're talking about, you know, this is going to enable mass
[43:06.960 --> 43:12.080]  surveillance and this is going to, you know, displace people's jobs and it's going to cause
[43:12.080 --> 43:14.000]  all these things that have come to pass.
[43:14.000 --> 43:21.260]  And, and so I think a lot of, a lot of people had a skepticism about personal computers
[43:21.260 --> 43:26.040]  that was also born of, keep in mind at that point, recent history, mainframes had come
[43:26.040 --> 43:28.120]  from a lot of military research.
[43:28.120 --> 43:34.640]  The country was still processing Vietnam and Watergate and all this kind of stuff.
[43:34.640 --> 43:38.280]  And so many, you know, whether it's Jobs, Gates, like all those early guys, they were,
[43:38.280 --> 43:43.400]  you know, very unapologetically long haired hippies and very much like what was then called
[43:43.400 --> 43:46.560]  counterculture and saw themselves as reacting to that.
[43:46.560 --> 43:52.400]  And I think that still informs, like there's this back and forth of that ambivalence about
[43:52.400 --> 43:56.640]  the role of computers and where they came from and what they were going to do to people
[43:56.640 --> 44:02.360]  that I think has gotten erased because I think we have this sort of warm, fuzzy nostalgia
[44:02.360 --> 44:03.360]  view of a lot of it.
[44:03.360 --> 44:06.760]  I think, you know, there's like the halt and catch fire version, and then there's like
[44:06.760 --> 44:11.400]  sort of kitschy eighties, like I said, the eight bit graphics and a Mario sprite.
[44:11.400 --> 44:15.040]  But the idea that there was actually a reckoning culturally with what are these things going
[44:15.040 --> 44:16.600]  to do to our lives?
[44:16.600 --> 44:18.880]  And then that repeated with the internet, right?
[44:18.880 --> 44:24.880]  With cyber crime and like the sort of cyber era, you know, early nineties.
[44:24.880 --> 44:27.600]  When cyber was an actively used prefix.
[44:27.600 --> 44:28.600]  Yes, exactly.
[44:28.600 --> 44:29.600]  Right.
[44:29.600 --> 44:31.600]  When people would unironically talk about something being cyber.
[44:31.600 --> 44:32.600]  The cyber era.
[44:32.600 --> 44:33.600]  Yeah.
[44:33.600 --> 44:34.600]  That's what we should call it.
[44:34.600 --> 44:35.600]  Right.
[44:35.600 --> 44:36.600]  It's very clear.
[44:36.600 --> 44:37.600]  You know what I mean?
[44:37.600 --> 44:41.960]  And, you know, and Wired magazine comes out and interestingly, then got wired or whatever
[44:41.960 --> 44:43.720]  was the like techno utopianism.
[44:43.720 --> 44:45.760]  Oh, this is going to free us all.
[44:45.760 --> 44:47.140]  We will be free from the shackles.
[44:47.140 --> 44:52.160]  And it's funny because that's this also this very counterculture, you know, Timothy Leary,
[44:52.160 --> 44:55.200]  we're going to this computers are LSD kind of thing.
[44:55.200 --> 44:56.200]  Yeah.
[44:56.200 --> 45:00.040]  Let's talk Windows 95, 25 years of Windows 95.
[45:00.040 --> 45:02.240]  And it is a fine version of Windows.
[45:02.240 --> 45:04.940]  You know, people lined up to buy it.
[45:04.940 --> 45:08.040]  It was an operating system.
[45:08.040 --> 45:09.040]  They did so weird.
[45:09.040 --> 45:10.040]  That's the weirdest thing.
[45:10.040 --> 45:13.320]  Like if you think about that retrospectively, you're like, well, what does it do?
[45:13.320 --> 45:15.800]  Well, it lets your other software do stuff.
[45:15.800 --> 45:16.800]  Right.
[45:16.800 --> 45:19.740]  How do you sell that product?
[45:19.740 --> 45:22.240]  People used to people used to line up for lots of things.
[45:22.240 --> 45:25.280]  This is another thing that definitely dates us.
[45:25.280 --> 45:28.920]  But like tickets, you know, right.
[45:28.920 --> 45:31.280]  You had to the only way to get good.
[45:31.280 --> 45:33.560]  I slept in a parking lot for Janet Jackson tickets.
[45:33.560 --> 45:34.560]  Yeah.
[45:34.560 --> 45:41.720]  I was a regular at the Ticketmaster in my college years over at 30 something in Lancaster
[45:41.720 --> 45:42.800]  and Philly.
[45:42.800 --> 45:46.320]  There was a Ticketmaster right next to the the Chili's.
[45:46.320 --> 45:47.320]  Yeah.
[45:47.320 --> 45:48.320]  Yeah.
[45:48.320 --> 45:49.320]  I know.
[45:49.320 --> 45:50.320]  I know that place.
[45:50.320 --> 45:52.120]  I think that I think the Chili's is a gentleman's club now.
[45:52.120 --> 45:53.120]  I'm not sure.
[45:53.120 --> 45:54.640]  But that's right.
[45:54.640 --> 45:58.840]  There was a Ticketmaster and and when certain acts were coming to town, you'd have to, you
[45:58.840 --> 46:03.480]  know, maybe not overnight, but you definitely, you know, the tickets went on sale at nine.
[46:03.480 --> 46:05.920]  You'd have to get there at like four or five in the morning.
[46:05.920 --> 46:06.920]  Yeah.
[46:06.920 --> 46:07.920]  You go early.
[46:07.920 --> 46:08.920]  Yeah.
[46:08.920 --> 46:09.920]  If it was a big show, I mean, again, I grew up in the sticks.
[46:09.920 --> 46:13.560]  And so like, if it was a big show, you'd be you'd be out there because it was like one
[46:13.560 --> 46:17.820]  one ticket window for for all this because I think but I think that sense of like scarcity
[46:17.820 --> 46:19.000]  is such an interesting thing.
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.920]  And then and then, you know, context wise for Windows 95.
[46:21.920 --> 46:26.480]  It's like, so I was I had had my first company by then and people were, you know, they were
[46:26.480 --> 46:27.480]  all on Windows.
[46:27.480 --> 46:32.400]  And that was just what you used at work that nonetheless you were a graphic designer, basically.
[46:32.400 --> 46:34.920]  And and so they were and they were doing spreadsheets and stuff.
[46:34.920 --> 46:38.800]  So you were you know, you were kind of splurge for a Mac that was that was perceived as much
[46:38.800 --> 46:41.220]  more expensive at the time.
[46:41.220 --> 46:45.920]  And it was wild because, you know, it was like being a plumber, right?
[46:45.920 --> 46:49.400]  If you're if your printer breaks, you call the computer guy and he'll come and plug in
[46:49.400 --> 46:50.600]  a new printer for you.
[46:50.600 --> 46:53.220]  But you didn't you didn't have an opinion about it.
[46:53.220 --> 46:54.220]  You didn't think about it.
[46:54.220 --> 46:56.560]  It was like thinking about your, you know, these are construction companies, I think
[46:56.560 --> 46:57.560]  about your table saw.
[46:57.560 --> 46:59.000]  If your saw blade breaks, you replace it.
[46:59.000 --> 47:02.840]  But you're not like, I can't wait for the new table saw.
[47:02.840 --> 47:04.120]  That's weird.
[47:04.120 --> 47:08.440]  And then and then and then literally summer of 95.
[47:08.440 --> 47:13.240]  We had, you know, customers calling us, you would call back then and call us and be like,
[47:13.240 --> 47:18.180]  can we get are you going to put Windows 95 on when it comes out?
[47:18.180 --> 47:20.480]  And that was such like it was inconceivable.
[47:20.480 --> 47:21.800]  It was just a weird thing.
[47:21.800 --> 47:23.360]  I'm like, how do you even know about it?
[47:23.360 --> 47:24.360]  Like, I know about it.
[47:24.360 --> 47:25.360]  That's my job.
[47:25.360 --> 47:32.920]  But it was weird, watching it remotely as a Mac user at the time.
[47:32.920 --> 47:38.440]  And what gets popularized is the religious angle of it.
[47:38.440 --> 47:44.040]  But the people who were truly there were partisans fighting for part of music internet is today.
[47:44.040 --> 47:45.720]  Yeah, it was.
[47:45.720 --> 47:52.320]  And it was an early sign of how the internet serves to polarize people very much so where
[47:52.320 --> 47:56.600]  and and I always had the palpable sense and I'm not trying to say that I'm any kind of
[47:56.600 --> 47:59.200]  sociological genius.
[47:59.200 --> 48:07.520]  I just think I'm humane and empathetic enough that it and my interests.
[48:07.520 --> 48:09.940]  My parents worries be damned.
[48:09.940 --> 48:13.960]  My interests I you know, have been outside the computer.
[48:13.960 --> 48:18.520]  You know, I played sports and I liked to go I just mentioned I did go to concerts.
[48:18.520 --> 48:20.640]  You know, I had real life.
[48:20.640 --> 48:22.560]  I have seen the outdoors.
[48:22.560 --> 48:26.120]  I have seen the outdoors.
[48:26.120 --> 48:30.920]  I never looked like I needed to get hit the sun to get some vitamin D. You know, it wasn't
[48:30.920 --> 48:36.080]  like, you know, come out and I like I was in a bunker.
[48:36.080 --> 48:40.880]  But it always seemed so obvious to me in the Usenet era that, my God, if we could just
[48:40.880 --> 48:45.360]  get these same people in a room together, it wouldn't be like this.
[48:45.360 --> 48:46.360]  Like no, no.
[48:46.360 --> 48:48.840]  And you can see that they had dehumanized each other.
[48:48.840 --> 48:51.760]  You're interacting through through these these platforms, right?
[48:51.760 --> 48:55.200]  And at that era, I remember very distinctly CompuServe.
[48:55.200 --> 48:58.760]  So this was another one of these dial-up services like AOL or whatever it was one of the earlier
[48:58.760 --> 48:59.760]  ones.
[48:59.760 --> 49:04.800]  And it was probably one of the first places and actually that's where the GIF was invented
[49:04.800 --> 49:07.200]  was for animation on that platform.
[49:07.200 --> 49:13.920]  And there was a very really early it was like the prototype of today's online battles and
[49:13.920 --> 49:14.920]  social media.
[49:14.920 --> 49:15.920]  Right.
[49:15.920 --> 49:18.400]  And the amazing thing about it was it would happen over anything.
[49:18.400 --> 49:22.120]  Like operating systems were actually, I think, one of the areas where it became a really
[49:22.120 --> 49:25.960]  big conversation because everybody had one very obviously then.
[49:25.960 --> 49:29.920]  And also, if you were using technology at that point, you had to have been an enthusiast.
[49:29.920 --> 49:35.200]  There was no casual computer user on CompuServe or on AOL because you had to have done the
[49:35.200 --> 49:38.480]  work to get connected in the first place, which was hard as hell to buy a modem and
[49:38.480 --> 49:40.920]  hook it up and do all this stuff, right?
[49:40.920 --> 49:42.520]  And so it became a part of your identity.
[49:42.520 --> 49:46.760]  You were a person that liked computers and being a person like computers was not cool
[49:46.760 --> 49:47.760]  at all.
[49:47.760 --> 49:50.720]  I think it's like so hard for people to understand.
[49:50.720 --> 49:57.960]  Like now, you know, Jack Dorsey was on a yacht with Beyonce and Jay-Z like two days ago.
[49:57.960 --> 49:59.080]  And Jack is not cool.
[49:59.080 --> 50:01.880]  I've known Jack for a long time, you know what I mean?
[50:01.880 --> 50:04.880]  And I'm like, that is wild, right?
[50:04.880 --> 50:08.340]  I know he's got his nose ring in now and whatever and, you know, God bless him.
[50:08.340 --> 50:11.840]  But I'm just like, they're nerds, right?
[50:11.840 --> 50:16.200]  And so like that idea of like the biggest pop star in the world is going to hang out
[50:16.200 --> 50:19.280]  or the biggest two pop stars in the world are going to hang out with a guy who made
[50:19.280 --> 50:20.480]  an app.
[50:20.480 --> 50:26.360]  Like that is not in reality in the, you know, 80s and 90s computer world, even into the
[50:26.360 --> 50:27.360]  2000s.
[50:27.360 --> 50:32.720]  And what's wild about it too is also how arbitrary it was because this sort of, I think it was
[50:32.720 --> 50:37.360]  operating systems and then the battles were video game consoles when they came out and,
[50:37.360 --> 50:42.720]  you know, the PlayStation people and the Sony, you know, the Sega people versus the Nintendo
[50:42.720 --> 50:43.720]  people.
[50:43.720 --> 50:45.720]  And it was like, guys, you own all of these.
[50:45.720 --> 50:50.080]  Like, what do you, I can't, I can't get into that cause we'll get distracted, but it's,
[50:50.080 --> 50:55.200]  it's, I was a Sega Genesis person and I've mentioned what my opinion, I assumed on the
[50:55.200 --> 50:56.200]  Nintendo.
[50:56.200 --> 50:57.200]  I could tell it about you.
[50:57.200 --> 50:58.200]  Oh my God.
[50:58.200 --> 50:59.200]  Do people think I'm wrong on that one?
[50:59.200 --> 51:01.160]  But you know, it was a much better system anyway.
[51:01.160 --> 51:06.360]  I believe that, that, uh, in the Bible it says Sega does when intend don't, I'm not
[51:06.360 --> 51:11.680]  an expert, but that's a fair, I, uh, no, I, you know, it's so it's like, you can laugh
[51:11.680 --> 51:15.640]  now, but it's like, it was, it was the first time we were seeing the prototypes of these
[51:15.640 --> 51:17.840]  behaviors where I'm like, why is this guy so mad?
[51:17.840 --> 51:21.880]  And the, the one that jumped out to me, and you'll probably remember this, but there was,
[51:21.880 --> 51:27.100]  so IBM was still a player back then in tech and they had an operating system called OS2
[51:27.100 --> 51:29.520]  and they had a new version called OS2 called OS2 warp.
[51:29.520 --> 51:32.580]  They came out right around the same time as Windows 95, a little before.
[51:32.580 --> 51:36.200]  And I am willing to believe it was technologically superior.
[51:36.200 --> 51:41.240]  This was what all of its acolytes, many acolytes told us, but they were notorious zealots,
[51:41.240 --> 51:42.240]  right?
[51:42.240 --> 51:43.240]  So it was like, oh, was it also ran?
[51:43.240 --> 51:45.400]  I mean, it was the smallest of the small audience.
[51:45.400 --> 51:47.800]  It was maybe 5% of computers.
[51:47.800 --> 51:50.040]  And you had to be, I mean, that was some nerd shit.
[51:50.040 --> 51:51.520]  Way less than 5%.
[51:51.520 --> 51:52.520]  Way less.
[51:52.520 --> 51:53.520]  Yeah.
[51:53.520 --> 51:54.520]  I mean, I'm, I'm being charitable.
[51:54.520 --> 51:55.520]  I don't like, they're still going to get mad at me.
[51:55.520 --> 52:00.560]  Like there were guys in my mentions in 2020 on Twitter talking to me about OS2 was better.
[52:00.560 --> 52:05.560]  I was like, like, sir, sir, you are probably damn near 60 years old.
[52:05.560 --> 52:09.200]  First of all, second of all, the war is lost.
[52:09.200 --> 52:14.640]  It's been lost, you know, and, and, and it sounds absurd, but it's like, uh, you realize
[52:14.640 --> 52:23.760]  that the sort of culture of grievance and the dehumanization of social media and the
[52:23.760 --> 52:28.720]  idea of like, my product is my identity, like the thing I've purchased is who I am.
[52:28.720 --> 52:32.100]  Like all those seeds were planted and it was so fascinating because Windows 95 was that
[52:32.100 --> 52:34.720]  catalyst because it was culturally relevant.
[52:34.720 --> 52:40.800]  If it had not been, if everybody ignored it or had just been some app that you buy, um,
[52:40.800 --> 52:44.160]  it wouldn't have mattered, but this was such a big deal that they're talking about it on
[52:44.160 --> 52:47.840]  late night TV shows and people are lining up at stores.
[52:47.840 --> 52:53.440]  And that's so interesting because the, you know, the, like, you can always tell a lot
[52:53.440 --> 52:56.760]  about the culture of organizations by what they criticize, what they have contempt for.
[52:56.760 --> 52:57.760]  Right.
[52:57.760 --> 53:00.720]  Like the, the, to me, the definitive Apple statement of all time is jobs saying like
[53:00.720 --> 53:02.600]  Microsoft has no taste, right.
[53:02.600 --> 53:04.760]  Cause it just sort of speaks to what they aspire to.
[53:04.760 --> 53:05.760]  Right.
[53:05.760 --> 53:10.000]  Even though he said that while he was in exile, it was, you know, it was before he came back.
[53:10.000 --> 53:13.280]  It was like a mid, you know, while, while he was an extra, you know.
[53:13.280 --> 53:14.280]  Right.
[53:14.280 --> 53:15.280]  Right.
[53:15.280 --> 53:16.280]  Right.
[53:16.280 --> 53:17.280]  Right.
[53:17.280 --> 53:18.760]  He's, he's still wandering in the desert at that point, but it's like, it was to that
[53:18.760 --> 53:24.520]  point, even at, in exile, the, the ethos and the value of what is the thing you care about
[53:24.520 --> 53:25.520]  is so fundamental.
[53:25.520 --> 53:26.520]  Yep.
[53:26.520 --> 53:27.520]  Right.
[53:27.520 --> 53:31.000]  And, and, and even, you know, when Microsoft is in the sort of department of justice trial
[53:31.000 --> 53:36.880]  and, and, and, and, you know, being really, really castigated for the first time, there's
[53:36.880 --> 53:39.120]  this sort of derision from Gates of like, this is beneath us.
[53:39.120 --> 53:42.520]  Like, why are you dumb people asking us questions that you don't know?
[53:42.520 --> 53:44.000]  You don't understand computers.
[53:44.000 --> 53:45.000]  And that same sort of contempt.
[53:45.000 --> 53:48.120]  And so like, this is really interesting thing of like, you can really tell about like what
[53:48.120 --> 53:52.800]  the anxieties of an organization and its culture are that makes technology.
[53:52.800 --> 53:58.040]  And in this idea of like, you know, the IBM acolytes really, really wanted to prove their
[53:58.040 --> 54:01.840]  operating system was technologically strong.
[54:01.840 --> 54:03.840]  And it's like, you know what?
[54:03.840 --> 54:04.840]  Nobody cares.
[54:04.840 --> 54:05.840]  Right.
[54:05.840 --> 54:11.260]  Like that is not, nobody is, nobody's evaluating your implementation of multitasking as a way
[54:11.260 --> 54:13.560]  of judging what product they're going to use.
[54:13.560 --> 54:16.040]  And that still bothered the tech.
[54:16.040 --> 54:17.040]  It still does.
[54:17.040 --> 54:18.040]  Right.
[54:18.040 --> 54:20.880]  So there was a real operating system has to be a command line or a real operating system
[54:20.880 --> 54:22.600]  has to have these technical constraints.
[54:22.600 --> 54:27.000]  And the idea that the aesthetics and the brand and the marketing and the cultural positioning
[54:27.000 --> 54:34.600]  and the social value of software, let alone operating systems, the most abstract software
[54:34.600 --> 54:38.280]  is going to be this decision made because the box is pretty and has clouds on it.
[54:38.280 --> 54:43.800]  Like that, that was such anathema to a prior, you know, culture of computing.
[54:43.800 --> 54:46.680]  And it was what it took to be to make, you know, really break to mainstream.
[54:46.680 --> 54:50.320]  And also the thing that I think they're still resentful of.
[54:50.320 --> 54:51.880]  Yeah.
[54:51.880 --> 54:55.240]  My favorite, one of my favorite Windows 95 stories, and it, and it, and it speaks to
[54:55.240 --> 55:02.440]  that bridge, the early outreach of the computer industry starting to touch mainstream culture.
[55:02.440 --> 55:09.240]  And so you mentioned Jack Dorsey just two days ago, hanging out with Beyonce.
[55:09.240 --> 55:11.400]  And that's just, we just don't even think about it.
[55:11.400 --> 55:17.800]  So 1995, the Rolling Stones had never licensed any of their music to anybody to use in a
[55:17.800 --> 55:18.800]  commercial.
[55:18.800 --> 55:24.160]  And Mick Jagger, Mick Jagger went to business school and, and always in his, you know, one
[55:24.160 --> 55:29.940]  of the reasons the Stones are massively, massively rich and didn't, and never got into disputes
[55:29.940 --> 55:32.880]  like the Beatles have with the ownership of their libraries.
[55:32.880 --> 55:35.760]  They were better business people because Mick was a better business person.
[55:35.760 --> 55:38.840]  I don't think Keith is.
[55:38.840 --> 55:40.520]  So Mick always handled stuff like this.
[55:40.520 --> 55:44.440]  Keith Richards with like the green accountant shade on, you know, sitting at the brass lamp
[55:44.440 --> 55:45.440]  during the books.
[55:45.440 --> 55:51.380]  So I don't know what the number is, but Mick's standard answer for 20 some years, whenever
[55:51.380 --> 55:55.200]  anybody would call up and say, we want to use one of your hits in a commercial is he
[55:55.200 --> 55:57.200]  had this, he didn't say no.
[55:57.200 --> 56:01.200]  He just would throw out this ridiculous, you know, $50 million or whatever.
[56:01.200 --> 56:05.040]  I don't know what the number, it doesn't matter, but it was always like, it was always like
[56:05.040 --> 56:08.400]  at least 20 times higher than they were possibly thinking it would cost.
[56:08.400 --> 56:10.360]  And then they would just hang up and they'd never go.
[56:10.360 --> 56:15.560]  And Microsoft calls up and they got the start menu for, that's the, it's the foundational
[56:15.560 --> 56:20.200]  UI element of windows 95 compared to what came before is the signature thing.
[56:20.200 --> 56:24.720]  The Stones have a hit song, start me up, they call up, they say, we want it licensed, start
[56:24.720 --> 56:28.700]  me up, and Mick says $40 million thinking that they hang up the phone.
[56:28.700 --> 56:30.920]  And they're just like, okay, where do we write the check to?
[56:30.920 --> 56:31.920]  And he's like, what?
[56:31.920 --> 56:32.920]  There was no negotiation.
[56:32.920 --> 56:36.400]  They're like, oh, is that it?
[56:36.400 --> 56:42.040]  And it just speaks to how much money Microsoft had.
[56:42.040 --> 56:43.040]  And they were like, oh, that's fantastic.
[56:43.040 --> 56:44.040]  That's perfect.
[56:44.040 --> 56:45.040]  All right, let me take a break.
[56:45.040 --> 56:46.040]  Let me take a break.
[56:46.040 --> 56:47.040]  Let's just hold this.
[56:47.040 --> 56:48.040]  We'll come back to it.
[56:48.040 --> 56:49.040]  We can't stop.
[56:49.040 --> 56:50.040]  Please.
[56:50.040 --> 56:51.800]  Hey, let me tell you about Honey Badger.
[56:51.800 --> 56:56.440]  Look, your code is going to have errors, even code written by the most amazing developer
[56:56.440 --> 57:00.800]  in the world, such as you, eventually going to have a bug.
[57:00.800 --> 57:05.840]  When bad things happen, it's nice to know that Honey Badger has your back.
[57:05.840 --> 57:12.240]  Honey Badger combines error monitoring, uptime monitoring, and cron monitoring into a single
[57:12.240 --> 57:13.920]  easy to use platform.
[57:13.920 --> 57:20.560]  Honey Badger monitors and sends error alerts in real time with all the context needed to
[57:20.560 --> 57:22.720]  see what's causing the error.
[57:22.720 --> 57:26.880]  Not just that there is a problem, but what's causing it, where it's hiding in your code
[57:26.880 --> 57:31.520]  so you can quickly fix it, get it back up and running, and get on with your day.
[57:31.520 --> 57:37.120]  Their included uptime and cron monitoring also lets you know when your external services
[57:37.120 --> 57:42.440]  that your service relies on are having issues or your background jobs go AWOL or silently
[57:42.440 --> 57:43.440]  fail.
[57:43.440 --> 57:51.080]  The team at Honey Badger, Star, Josh, and Ben, they created a 100% bootstrapped monitoring
[57:51.080 --> 57:52.080]  solution.
[57:52.080 --> 57:53.680]  Why is this important?
[57:53.680 --> 57:59.880]  Self-funding means they, the team at Honey Badger, answers only to you, the developer,
[57:59.880 --> 58:05.280]  their customers, rather than any sort of venture capital overlord, anything like that.
[58:05.280 --> 58:08.800]  They're running, they're a small team running a great service.
[58:08.800 --> 58:10.080]  Their customers are you.
[58:10.080 --> 58:11.400]  They want you to be happy.

[58:13.120 --> 58:14.560]  You get great service in return.
[58:14.560 --> 58:15.780]  It's that simple.
[58:15.780 --> 58:18.240]  It's a great company and they have a great service.
[58:18.240 --> 58:22.440]  They have a great deal too for listeners of this show.

[59:14.160 --> 59:18.720]  My thanks to Honey Badger at honeybadger.io.
[59:18.720 --> 59:20.080]  We were talking about Windows 95.
[59:20.080 --> 59:26.100]  I just mentioned this story with the Stones song getting licensed by Microsoft.
[59:26.100 --> 59:27.640]  This is the thing.
[59:27.640 --> 59:31.200]  Music finance is an obsession of mine, the economics and ownership of music.
[59:31.200 --> 59:34.600]  The thing that's really, really interesting here, first of all, is mid-90s, you still
[59:34.600 --> 59:36.980]  have the idea of selling out.
[59:36.980 --> 59:42.240]  Only a year or two before, you have Kurt Cobain in Rolling Stone magazine with the t-shirts
[59:42.240 --> 59:47.440]  saying corporate music still sucks and Bob Dylan very adamantly like, you won't license
[59:47.440 --> 59:48.440]  my music for everybody.
[59:48.440 --> 59:53.320]  It was a scandal only a couple of years before when the Beatles licensed Revolution for a
[59:53.320 --> 59:54.320]  Nike commercial.
[59:54.320 --> 59:59.560]  People were like, oh my God, how could you sully yourselves?
[59:59.560 --> 01:00:02.400]  It's the inverse of culture now where it's like everybody brags about who they got the
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:06.800]  endorsement from and who's sponsoring them and what product placement they got and whatever.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:11.160]  That cultural context is really, really important because part of the reason why the Stones
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:14.360]  are  in addition to Jagger's business acumen, part of the reason the Stones are
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:19.760]  saying you won't license our song is because the sort of 60s ethos of this is art.
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:22.940]  How would you use this in an ad?
[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:25.720]  That would be beneath you.
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:32.040]  This is really interesting because part of the myth-making, the legend building around
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:35.120]  Windows 95 at the time was they talked about licensing the song.
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:39.520]  There was this sort of meta-industry thing where they said, well, it must have cost $12
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:40.520]  million, $14 million.
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:46.520]  I remember hearing that and actually years, years later, the number came out was $3 million,
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:49.320]  which is still a boatload of money especially at that point.
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:54.240]  But it's not actually that wild and I think it was a $200 million ad campaign.
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:01:00.120]  It's like, okay, we spent 1% of our money on a song or 2% of our  nobody would blink
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.120]  at that now.
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.480]  But I think they just saw where the future was going because you're going to have to
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.480]  market stuff.
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:09.280]  And I also think like one of those animating forces of Microsoft in all the way through
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:15.640]  the 90s, really until 2000 in the sort of bomber era and well into that era, is their
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:17.320]  sort of resentment of Apple, right?
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:21.520]  Like we're so much bigger and we have so much money and Apple is really on the rocks
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:25.000]  over those next couple of years after Windows 95 comes out.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.600]  And yet Microsoft is like, but why are they cool and we're not cool?
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:34.640]  And I think they sort of at this moment arrive at, if we spend the money and buy some friends
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:40.840]  and get a song and at that point too, like start me up as like 14 years old, that was
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:45.400]  clearly to my mind  I felt at the time like I was like, I don't remember the song.
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.480]  I was a kid when this came out.
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.160]  But I was like, oh, they had some middle-aged guy that this was like the song that was cool
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:55.480]  when he was young and they wanted to play this song because he's going to be the guy
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.480]  buying this.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.040]  And I was like, oh, right, and now I think about it.
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:01.960]  I'm like, oh, yeah, if you got a song 14 years ago, like sure, yeah, I like this song
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:02.960]  when this come out.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:03.960]  You know what I mean?
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:04.960]  Like, because I'm old, you know?
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:08.160]  And I think like that's such a  like that was just all that stuff was not evident
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.160]  at the time.
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:10.160]  I was like, this is corny.
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:13.040]  And they got these old guys out there playing the song and they had Jay Leno, which they
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.040]  were thrilled about.
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:15.180]  And I was like, I didn't think he was cool then.
[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:16.320]  Now we all know he's not cool.
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:19.720]  But like that was such a like, you know, it was such an interesting thing of like, they
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:24.720]  still didn't have taste, but they knew how to pretend they were culturally relevant.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:27.320]  Yeah, that's what was always the thing to me.
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.280]  I was always aligned with that.
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.840]  And, you know, again, it's like you said, like, why I was attracted to the Vectrex,
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:36.080]  you know, because it was graphically novel.
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.280]  It wasn't the technical arguments, right?
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.960]  And it was like, I totally I read, you know, the O.S. 2 warp magazine once and it was like,
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:50.020]  I get it, you know, and I ended up graduating with a degree in computer science and I can
[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:52.440]  program and make stuff and I get it.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:55.640]  But that just didn't ring my bell.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:56.640]  You know what I mean?
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:57.640]  It wasn't the thing I was after.
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:58.640]  There was no soul to it.
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.640]  Yeah.
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:00.640]  It was the taste thing.
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:04.440]  And that's it.
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:10.360]  So the thing I remember about Windows 95 and the other thing that you have to remember
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:16.240]  about when we talk about the cultural aspect of this was the way that like in a group,
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:17.680]  if you're on the internet, it was Usenet.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:22.300]  If you were on any group on AOL or CompuServer, any of these services, it doesn't matter
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:23.720]  what the group was about.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:29.840]  If it was about quilting, if it was about the Boston Celtics, if it was about vintage
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:33.160]  Corvettes, there were groups for all of these interests.
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.640]  And at some point throughout the year, it would break into a Mac versus PC flame war
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.240]  and it would get a hundred percent.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:40.240]  All right.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:41.240]  Yeah.
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:42.240]  Totally.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.240]  Yeah.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:44.240]  Yeah.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.800]  All of a sudden it's Hatfield's versus McCoy's.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:48.400]  And it's like, you know, what are you talking about?
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:56.280]  And there was this weird thing where sort of pre 95, pre windows 95, there was a, the
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:02.320]  PC enthusiasts were, there was these, this command line versus gooey aspect of the argument
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.440]  and very strongly.
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:08.560]  And clearly that one, I was like, you guys are, you guys are wrong right there.
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:12.240]  And you know, history is not on your side and it's very obvious, right?
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:17.440]  And there was a Steve jobs line about like when they first saw the stuff at Xerox park,
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:22.220]  that was a gooey that, you know, just basically, Oh, I just instantly knew, Oh, all computers
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:23.320]  are going to work like this.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:26.800]  We just had to figure out the right way to do it.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.200]  That was ridiculous.
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.960]  But then it's just like anything in politics.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:36.160]  And I mean that in the lowercase P political sense of anything being political, right?
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.160]  Yeah.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:41.000]  That people, when people's minds change, it happens quickly, right?
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  Yeah.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  Yeah.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  Yeah.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  I keep saying to people, and there's a tipping point.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.880]  I keep talking to people in the context of national politics, like just for a sense.
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:53.280]  And again, we're talking the same 12 years we're talking about with the app store.
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:05:00.800]  Just remember that when Barack Obama ran for president the first time, he was against legalized
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:01.800]  same sex marriage.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:02.800]  Yeah.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.800]  Yeah.
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.800]  Marriage equality was a, was a late arrival.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.800]  Right.
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:06.800]  Right.
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.800]  And you know, and it just seems like, what?
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.800]  That was 12 years ago.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:09.800]  That was Obama.
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:10.800]  Right.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.800]  And it's like, well, it wasn't because he was opposed.
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:16.440]  That was what was politically feasible, and that's how quickly public sentiment changes.
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:19.160]  That's an issue that doesn't even come up, even in today's world.
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.480]  Just gone.
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:24.800]  The whole command line, every, you know, real computer has a command line, real user knows
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:25.800]  how to use it.
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:26.800]  And it just went away.
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:30.160]  Windows 95 came out, and we had, and again, it speaks to what I was saying before.
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:33.240]  You were doing so much on your computer, you needed it.
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.280]  And so much of it was graphical, right?
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:39.280]  I mean, you know, you're looking at pictures, you're looking at the GIFs on websites, you
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.280]  know?
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.280]  Yeah.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:42.560]  And you're looking at it in a command line aspect.
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:47.640]  And there was a certain segment of Mac user who wanted it to be a religious argument,
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:50.400]  who was like, hey, what happened to the command line argument, guys?
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.400]  You know?
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:56.560]  And it's like, you know, you don't, it's like sort of like not knowing how to accept that
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:57.560]  you won.
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.560]  You know, you're the dog that caught the car.
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:00.560]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.640]  It's not a very, yeah, it's being a sort of winner, right?
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:04.640]  Right.
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.440]  And I think it's such an interesting thing, too, because it was also, both sides were
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:09.940]  supposing that it was about logic, right?
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:10.940]  And it wasn't.
[01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:16.400]  It was just like asserting identity and asserting belonging and saying you're part of a community
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.680]  by what you reject.
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:21.900]  Like what you are not is what defines you in these online communities.
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:23.000]  And this is still the issue.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.840]  Like, this is still the issue, right, is everybody is really sort of saying, like, I have to
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:35.200]  prove I am not part of out group because that is what, you know, we didn't have the metrics
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.040]  back then, but that's what drives engagement.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.200]  That is what's going to get a response.
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.400]  That's how we're going to form our identity with each other.
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:45.560]  And I do think it was about, you know, in that era, everybody had a handle online.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.380]  They didn't have their real name, right?
[01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:51.880]  And so you would, you know, you would be whatever, Mac Fan 52, right?
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:57.600]  And so that you were choosing how you're going to represent yourself to people.
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:05.280]  And the only way you could do it was through increasing the emotional tenor, you know,
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.280]  of what's going on.
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:11.400]  And it's so weird because that was also the moment when we had, you know, civilians
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.120]  coming in and getting technology.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:17.040]  They were like, I heard about a Pentium, I heard about a Windows 95, I just saw the Netscape
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.080]  IPO and I realized the internet must be something.
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.800]  Like, this is all in a moment, right?
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:26.120]  Like the Pentium bug is early 95, Netscape IPO is the first or second week of August
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:33.940]  of 95, Windows 95 comes out the third week of, you know, end of August of 95.
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:38.160]  Like all of a sudden a person who is not interested in computers is like, I don't need to know
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:42.840]  that or that's not part of my job or I'm not going to spend $2,000 to have one at home
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:47.000]  is like, I am missing something and I better get it.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  And I'm better and, you know, a year later AOL goes, they've already started to send
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.020]  out the disks and stuff, but like, you know, they go with unlimited, you know, internet
[01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:57.880]  access a year later.
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:02.440]  All of a sudden people are like, you know, I got to get on, I got to get in and they're
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:08.480]  running right into that first wave of computer users, tech users saying like, we have figured
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:12.080]  out that us fighting with each other about things that mean nothing is what we're going
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:13.560]  to use this platform for.
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:18.560]  And it, isn't it funny how we, it's certainly these things come around, you know, and kind
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:24.700]  of do apply however antiquated they are like, yeah, the analogies are there, right.
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:28.160]  But like with AOL, so AOL always gets a bad rap in hindsight.
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:29.160]  It wasn't great.
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:30.400]  It was, it didn't have taste.
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:36.280]  It was technically limited, you know, but, but it was good at some stuff well, but the,
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:40.280]  and the huge force I, and it was easy for someone like me who was in college at the
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:46.520]  time and had access to real Unix systems that I could tell that into, to get internet access
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:52.360]  and then use, you know, things that transformed a terminal connection into a IP connection.
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:55.040]  You know, it was like IP over, over telnet.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.040]  Yeah.
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.040]  Right.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.040]  Right.
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:02.760]  And it was easy for me to list a tin can string down on AOL, right.
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:07.800]  But that, that breakthrough, you have to remember that at the time, all the online services
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:12.020]  would build by the hour, like the way that long distance phone calls worked at the time.
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:15.760]  And it was like, you could see, so there's a bean counters perspective where it's like,
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.700]  of course we're going to build by the hour.
[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:19.740]  This thing is addictive.
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:20.840]  People love it.
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:25.200]  And we're making a mint by charging by the hour and the breakthrough that AOL had of,
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:29.240]  we're just going to charge you some reasonable amount per month.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:35.240]  And you can just use it as often as your fellow family members will let you hog the phone.
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:36.240]  Right.
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:37.240]  Yeah.
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.640]  I mean, it was radical and brave, right?
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:44.640]  Cause it is foregoing, you know, revenues, but also it is enabling something horizontally,
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.640]  right?
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.540]  There's a sort of democratization to that.
[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:52.400]  And I think that was actually one of the reasons that like tech insiders had been derisive
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:53.400]  of AOL.
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:57.200]  There's a phrase that used to be used all the time then on Usenet of the September that
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:01.000]  never ended, which is alluding to September is when students would come back to universities
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.960]  and a bunch of new people would come onto the internet and they didn't know the norms.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:06.320]  And so they were frustrated by that.
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:10.360]  And then AOL being like the equivalent of those people all the time, September that
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:11.520]  never ended.
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:14.280]  And what it was, was saying, we don't like these new people.
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:17.880]  They don't, they aren't us, they aren't the tech experts, tech insiders.
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.440]  And I always really hated that.
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:23.880]  I always was like, isn't this why we're doing this?
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:27.840]  Didn't we want to give this power and this technology to everybody?
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:30.880]  And I mean, this echoes with me, this was the experience I had in Silicon Valley where
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:34.600]  I was like, aren't we trying to build a social networks for everybody that everybody can
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:40.200]  be on them and not be harassed and have their lives ruined or whatever else.
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:43.200]  And it was like, no, they really were like, this is for us, this is our playhouse.
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:48.720]  And I think that fundamental pattern keeps playing out over and over and over, which
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:52.160]  is like, do we care about the overall experience of the design?
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:57.720]  Or is it only the pure narrow definition of this kind of technology is what defines merit?
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.280]  I've always thought that.
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:04.360]  And I was always, and again, I'm not trying to retroactively claim to be more empathetic
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.640]  than I was as a 20 year old.
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:10.960]  I was a jerk in a lot of ways that, and people are like, was it jerk?
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:13.120]  And it's like, yeah, probably still am.
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:14.120]  But I was more of a jerk.
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:15.960]  I was a lot more of a jerk and I was cocky.
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:26.240]  But I was never as like anti let those newbies in and let the AOL people in as, to me, it
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:30.920]  was always more, doesn't this just show how broken the system is?
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:34.520]  It just shows these systems weren't built for this.
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:39.540]  And think about just the simple fact of email and we're literally, it's the social network
[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.000]  that will outlive us all.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.960]  It's the cockroach of social networks.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:48.640]  But the fundamental idea of once you have an email address, anybody anywhere can send
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:54.320]  you email and the marginal cost of sending it is literally zero.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:59.640]  I mean, as close to zero as you can possibly get, it's like the power to keep the computer
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:04.920]  on that's chunking out the spam.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:07.000]  And the real world analogies work.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  Like if physical printed mail had that, if you got as much junk mail through your door
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.640]  as you get spam, it's ridiculous.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:21.200]  And there's no possibility in the real world of a spam filter, right?
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:25.240]  So just like go into your email program and look at your junk mailbox and look at how
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:28.000]  many mails you don't even have to look at every day.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.960]  Imagine if they were coming in through your door every day.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:33.520]  But that's the way the system was made because it never even occurred to anybody when they
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:36.200]  made the email system that anybody would abuse it.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:38.640]  You know, it just was a poorly designed system.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:39.640]  And that's what it is.
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:43.960]  Like that idea of like the assumptions are baked into the technology at such a deep level,
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:44.960]  right?
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.960]  And who it's for, who was using it, what they anticipated.
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:53.880]  And I think of a generation later where we were building early social platforms, all
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:57.480]  the mistakes we made were the same thing of just conceiving like how many people could
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.020]  possibly use this and what are they going to use it for.
[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:01.880]  And you don't know what you don't know.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:02.880]  Yeah.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.920]  And, you know, and again, we did.
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:09.640]  We made this, you know, I say we, I never had comments on my site because I kind of
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:10.640]  saw it.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:11.640]  You got it right.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:12.640]  Yeah.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:13.640]  But it was, you know.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:14.640]  That's actually a great example, right?
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:21.800]  Like I did for a long time and it was this very optimistic, well, I still have friends
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:22.800]  that I made that way.
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:23.800]  Right.
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:26.280]  There are people that were at my wedding, there are people that have been there for
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:31.720]  me in the hardest parts of my life that I know because of the comments on my site, right?
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:35.400]  And so like there was a place to make a connection if you were going to put in the work.
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:38.840]  And that was sort of the other part was like, well, who would have a website and not moderate
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:39.840]  the comments?
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:40.840]  That would be wrong.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:41.840]  Right.
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:42.840]  You know what I mean?
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:45.360]  Like that naive, that was actually the part, that was the part where we found out it wasn't
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:49.160]  like, oh, put a comment box on your website is a bad idea.
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:53.000]  It was, you know, I think the choice you always made, I remember this from back in the day,
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.920]  you're like, I don't want to deal with that.
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:55.920]  Yes.
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:58.080]  And I'm like, and I'm like, that makes perfect sense.
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:59.720]  That is a reasonable choice.
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:03.400]  But the idea that you would say, I don't want to deal with that and I'm going to have it
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:05.600]  was not a thing that we anticipated.
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.360]  That was one where it's like, who on earth would do that?
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:11.400]  Who would say, I don't want to be responsible for what I'm putting out in the world and
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:12.400]  I would like to have it?
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:13.400]  Right.
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:16.940]  Like that seemed so irrational, let alone that every newspaper in the country would
[01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:17.940]  do it.
[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:18.940]  Right.
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:19.940]  Like that was unimaginable.
[01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:22.200]  I was like, that's so stupid.
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.600]  Obviously nobody would ever do that and everybody did it.
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:25.600]  Yeah.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:26.600]  It was.
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:31.400]  And again, we could do a whole nostalgic show, but there was any early era of newspapers
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.080]  going online.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:35.440]  They would just have open comments on every article.
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:36.440]  Why?
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:37.440]  It was just anybody.
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:40.640]  You just type, type your name and you, you know, they'd ask for an email.
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:41.640]  Never verified it.
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:43.360]  And you'd type wherever your comment is.
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:48.720]  And every news article you read on any topic just had whoever wanted to commenting below
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.440]  it and they would just put them in there.
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:57.880]  And ignoring, ignoring automated spam, it was just, you know, the, the level of crackpottery
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:00.920]  that you would think it might be.
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:05.600]  And I think that's sort of this recurring thing we're like that caused real harm because
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.720]  we didn't anticipate the abuse of the system.
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:08.720]  Right.
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:11.600]  And, and, and, and there's this tension that comes, and I think this goes to the point
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.300]  about sort of Windows 95 or everything.
[01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:18.800]  There's this back and forth around democratization of technology, along with enabling new forms
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:21.880]  of abuse, misuse, or manipulation.
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:23.480]  And they go hand in hand every time.
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:24.840]  Like there's always that cycle.
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:28.760]  And it was, I mean, people were worried about this in the rise of desktop publishing.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:33.920]  You talk about that as like, well, if anybody can print a pamphlet, you know, if anybody
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:38.000]  can make something that looks professionally designed, how are we going to know it's real
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  information?
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  I was like, you never did.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.880]  But that was a real concern that was raised.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:44.040]  It was like a laser print is going to make it look official.
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.040]  You know, it's like, yeah.
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:48.840]  And I was like, great, then my band is going to look like it's doing, putting on a real
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:49.840]  show.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:50.840]  Right.
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:52.320]  You know, but they were like, well, then you're going to have, you know, propaganda there.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:55.640]  And so that, that framing, I think just comes back over and over and over.
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:16:00.080]  And it's such a, like after the 50th time the cycle repeats, are we going to learn to
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.080]  learn the lesson?
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:02.080]  I don't know.
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:03.080]  All right.
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:04.080]  Let me take a break right here.
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:07.360]  My thanks to Linode cloud hosting.
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:09.040]  That's where Daring Fireball is hosted.
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:14.280]  Oh man, do I love Linode, whether you're working on a personal project or managing your enterprise's
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:19.640]  entire infrastructure, Linode cloud hosting has the pricing support and scale.

[01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.800]  storage they call it.
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:03.360]  It's just like plug and play for existing code you already have that's set up for S3.
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:10.600]  You can plug it in to use Linode cloud storage, object storage, just that easy.
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:15.440]  They've got, like I said, 11 data centers worldwide and their low end systems, their
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:21.120]  nano plans are great for little personal things like running game servers for Minecraft and
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:25.560]  other games that run like that, that you can have your own private server or your own private
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:30.800]  server for your kids and their friends, which is, trust me, will make you a very popular
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:31.800]  parent.

[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:37.000]  The nano plan is just five bucks a month and you get 20 bucks with the coupon I already
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  told you about.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.440]  So you get like four months free.
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:42.400]  Not even like four months free, four months free.
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:46.580]  Anyway, just remember that promo code is talk show 20.

[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:09.720]  My thanks to Linode for sponsoring this show.
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:10.720]  All right, let's get up.
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:16.720]  Let's flash forward to the future and let's talk about, and I think that it's like the
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:23.680]  jump cut in 2001 where the bone in the air transforms into the floating space station.
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:27.920]  That's like a missile silo.
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:33.120]  The app store and where Apple is and where we've gotten and this sort of eruption of,
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:38.160]  well, it's just college, you know, not to make light of the other protests of more pertinent
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:40.680]  social matters, but it's protest, right?
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:45.800]  People are, there's an eruption of protest about Apple's control of the app store.
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:50.360]  This is the biggest wide scale criticism of certainly the app store and I think of Apple's
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:53.840]  business practices that I can recall in their modern era.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:54.840]  Yeah.
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:59.960]  And I'm struggling to keep up with it at Daring Fireball.
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:05.240]  I really am because, and I'm, I'm even struggling to come up with the analogy, but the best
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:11.520]  I've come up with is like, it's, there is no single, there's no single way to wrap it
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:12.520]  up.
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:13.520]  And that's my instinct.
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:14.520]  My style is to write.
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:21.640]  And even if it takes me 3000 words, you know, I get the 3000 word Daring Fireball column
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:22.640]  out on the thing.
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:27.380]  And then at the end I type that last period and it's like, boom, there it is.
[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:28.380]  Drop the mic.
[01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:32.460]  Right, your definitive take, there is no, there's no, there, there's no way to do that
[01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:34.120]  with this app store issue.
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:36.080]  It is like, this thing is fuzzy.
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:37.080]  Yeah.
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:39.000]  And, and it's so sprawling and there's so many different things.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:47.280]  It's like, it's like going into a Vegas buffet and, and you're hungry, but like you can't
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:50.360]  even possibly sample everything, right?
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:52.120]  There's just no way to do it.
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:57.760]  It's not feasible, you know, and, and it's like there's the beverage station that everybody
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:58.760]  goes to.
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.720]  Everybody has to get something to drink when he goes to the buffet.
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:01.720]  Right, right.
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:02.720]  There's some consensus.
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:07.200]  And that's the 30%, the 30-70 split is like the beverage station and it doesn't matter
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:12.640]  if you're here for the prime rib or you're a vegetarian or you're actually just going
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:16.800]  to do all dessert because screw it, you're on vacation.
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.380]  You're still going to the beverage station.
[01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:21.280]  So everybody is talking about 30% is too much, blah, blah, blah.
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:22.960]  But there's so much other stuff.
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:29.660]  But the thing that to me is like the, the part of the argument at the forest level rather
[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:33.540]  than the tree level, that is very frustrating.
[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:40.360]  And it really, and I feel people aren't talking about it enough is well, however much money
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:44.700]  Apple's making from this, this is not, this is a side gig for them.
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:45.700]  It really is.
[01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:46.700]  It's not material.
[01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:53.240]  And you talk about like the abuses, I was, and again, going back to the nineties, I was
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:59.160]  never, I was never, even as a, as a Mac enthusiast at the time, I was never very keen about the
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:04.640]  DOJ suit against Microsoft and never really thought I wasn't really like a Mac user who
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.080]  was like, ah, they're getting there.
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:10.520]  I was like, ah, this doesn't seem right to me and it seems shortsighted.
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:13.440]  I didn't think that making IE free was abusive.
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:16.960]  I was like, yeah, I think that this is the way things are going and it kind of sucks
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:21.200]  that Netscape was selling copies of Netscape navigator pro or whatever they called it,
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:31.240]  but gold, um, it's, it was though what Microsoft, what people accused, what people were upset
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:35.600]  about Microsoft's abuse of their position was their primary business, right?
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:39.760]  And that this, uh, you know, to, to encapsulate it, the idea that they had control of the
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:46.120]  operating system and their real money maker was the office suite of software that ran
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:47.360]  on the operating system.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:48.360]  That was their whole business.
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:56.160]  Their whole business was licensing the operating system to OEMs and selling office like the
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:00.180]  whole idea that Microsoft became the biggest company in the world or the second biggest
[01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:01.180]  company in the world.
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:08.480]  And Bill Gates is a cultural icon at the time was entirely about this two sided coin of
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:14.400]  they have the os that every computer runs on and they have the apps that run on the
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:17.840]  os and that's their whole business and that's where people poked at.
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:21.720]  And now we're talking about apple and apple having dominance.
[01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:22.720]  That's for sure.
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:28.040]  You know, we can argue about what's a monopoly, but we're talking about them and this widespread
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:33.800]  criticism of their business practices over a thing that is not really, I'm not going
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:36.520]  to say it's not material, but it's not that big a deal.
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:39.680]  And you can say, oh, services, services, services is what they've been pushing.
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:45.320]  But even when you break out services, the part from the app store is only a, I'm not
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:48.520]  saying it's a tiny part of it, but it's only a small part of it.
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:53.200]  You know, they make, they make $20 billion a year from Google just to make Google the
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.360]  default search engine.
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:58.680]  And I think they've only got like 50 billion in services a year.
[01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:03.160]  Like a huge chunk of their services isn't, is just money from Google.
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:06.600]  It's not even all of these subscription things that apple is selling.
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:07.600]  Right.
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:09.120]  That's like found the money under the couch cushions.
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:12.440]  So, so yeah, there's a, there's a lot in there and I want to, I think actually context settings
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:13.440]  really useful.
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:18.860]  You go back to the, the earlier topic, windows 95, one of the things they introduced along
[01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:22.540]  with windows 95 and office 95 and all that stuff was Microsoft introduced that design
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:24.840]  for windows 95 logo.
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:27.760]  And it was like, it was seen as valuable.
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:31.720]  You're going to be part of the marketing campaign, but you're, you're, you're not called app.
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:35.880]  I was going to say app, but your program, your software has to conform to a certain
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:37.480]  set of rules.
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:39.080]  And I was all in favor of it.
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.080]  I thought it was great.
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.080]  Cause it's like, there's a lot of crap.
[01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:42.080]  There's a lot of shovelware.
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:48.160]  There's this garbage bargain basement, CD-ROMs at, at, at, you know your office Depot store
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.160]  back then.
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:52.120]  And, and, and so it'd be like, no, no, no, if you want to get this logo, you got to do
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:53.280]  these things.
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:59.720]  And I was a big believer in it and I saw a straight line from that kind of thing to the
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:01.760]  early versions of the app store.
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:02.760]  Right.
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:07.160]  And so, and my context on that was you know, you'll remember this, but for your audience,
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:11.000]  I was working in a company that did blogging tools at the time we did a blogging service
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  called type pad.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000]  It's like what WordPress is now.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:19.640]  And the type pad app launched at the launch of the app store, it was the second app ever
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:20.640]  shown off.
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:24.640]  Michael Sippy, who's now at medium was on stage with Steve jobs showing off this app.
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:32.280]  And so we got a glimpse at what it is to be the featured after in an Apple keynote, really
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:34.880]  before anybody, right.
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:39.480]  And and what they asked for, like what, what was it going to take to be in the app store
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:42.240]  as the first app that people see?
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:47.840]  And it was interesting because to my mind, it was very much of a piece with design for
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:52.200]  windows 95 or design for windows XP or any of these kinds of things like this is, and
[01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:54.760]  that was actually very, very contentious at the time.
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:25:00.280]  The idea that Apple would set standards separate from the 30%, separate from anything else,
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:04.200]  the economics of it, the idea that they would set rules about what you could or couldn't
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:09.560]  do on the device with software that you made was extremely controversial.
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:10.560]  Right.
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:13.960]  And I think that's sort of important to start with is there is a fundamental developer tension
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:16.160]  and that's a long time ago, but it's not that long time ago.
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:22.600]  I think Apple, Apple in particular Apple developers have a longer institutional memory than most
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:23.840]  developer communities.
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:26.680]  So it could, we still talk about things getting Sherlocked.
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:27.680]  How long ago was that?
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:28.680]  Right.
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:30.960]  So, so how many people really remember Sherlock?
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:31.960]  I mean, right.
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:32.960]  Right.
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:33.960]  Yeah.
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:36.400]  I mean, how many users did Sherlock have at its peak versus people who've talked about
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:37.400]  an app getting Sherlocked?
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:38.400]  Right.
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:39.400]  Right.
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.760]  Let alone, let alone Watson, the third party tool that got Sherlocked.
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:42.760]  Yeah.
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:43.760]  Right.
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:44.760]  Right.
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:45.760]  Right.
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:52.440]  And so, so we have a perception about what developer culture and the Apple ecosystem
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:53.440]  should be.
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:57.760]  And interestingly, even the iOS ecosystem, though it's much larger and more culturally
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:00.280]  relevant is still shaped by the Mac history.
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:01.280]  Right.
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:07.440]  So like, like the, the way we parse what I ought to be able to do, cause I make software
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:11.680]  is this very, it's a, it's a set of cultural norms and expectations.
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:16.600]  And that's why it's fuzzy because it is not about an economic argument about 30% where
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:19.280]  if they reduce 30%, 28% would be like, okay, we're good.
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:20.280]  Let's pack up.
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.280]  We're good.
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:22.280]  Right.
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:23.280]  Like it is not that at all.
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:26.640]  And this is actually what Microsoft got wrong in the DOJ and antitrust trial around Internet
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:32.680]  Explorer, which was one, the amount of resentment of Microsoft was off the charts.
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:36.720]  It is like what Apple is now for the people that don't like it, you know, Epic or whatever,
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:38.520]  where they were just seen as bullies.
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:43.760]  They were seen as having all the control and we have a fundamental mismatch between how
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:49.040]  the tech industry works, how modern software platforms work and how the law works.
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.040]  Right.
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:52.560]  So antitrust law is based on a whole bunch of false assumptions.
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:56.200]  You know, one of them is that there's this market and there are these two players, right?
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:58.560]  I can buy whatever I can buy a pencil from this company.
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.200]  I can buy a pencil from that company.
[01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:06.820]  And there is nobody that is like, I'm going to make a considered decision about what social
[01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:11.040]  network I'm going to use and I evaluated all the options and Facebook didn't have the features
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:12.040]  I want.
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:13.040]  So I'm going to use Brand X.
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:14.040]  Right.
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:15.040]  It doesn't exist that way.
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:16.040]  Right.
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:19.960]  And that's the misapprehension that our regulatory framework has in the U.S. and that affects
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:23.840]  the whole world because everybody's using American companies' technology.
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:26.740]  And then, and this sort of goes to, you know, when you were talking, I think with Neelay
[01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:35.220]  about the congressional hearings, Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook, these companies are
[01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:36.220]  completely different.
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:37.220]  Yeah.
[01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:39.040]  Like they all have apps, but their business models are different.
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:40.280]  Their goals are different.
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:41.560]  In some ways they compete with each other.
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:45.000]  In some ways they all collaborate together, but they are, they have nothing in common
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  fundamentally.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  Right.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  And even in terms of what they're trying to do in the world.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  And so when you have all that stuff that's wrong and the people talking about it are
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.680]  developers that have their own distinct culture and goals of what they're trying to enable
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:28:00.080]  and what they expect from a platform, and that is illegible to policymakers and to users.
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:03.900]  Like that's, I think where the fuzziness comes from because everybody is forced to reframe
[01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:10.840]  their argument in terms that are either in the case of Epic, legible to lawmakers, to
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:16.000]  regulators, which is their clear audience that they're sort of speaking to, or to consumers,
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.360]  which they're also speaking to, but all the other devs are like, I need the user to understand
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:22.280]  why this, the 30% cost will be passed down to you.
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:26.160]  Like people fixate on the 30% because users like that must be expensive.
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:30.600]  That's I think it's very easy to understand, but if we talk about what we're actually trying
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:35.440]  to enable is competition, then the question is what competition to whom, at what level,
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:36.440]  right?
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:42.240]  And in the case of Microsoft and DOJ, it manifested in the end of the game as they had people
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:45.120]  in the room watching them during meetings that slowed them down from being able to do
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:46.120]  stuff.
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:50.040]  And we saw that with the stagnation of Microsoft for the decade after, right?
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:53.260]  From the first decade of Bloomberg's rise where they just made a bunch of boring enterprise
[01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:57.960]  products and they made billions of dollars and nobody cared, except for the Xbox, right?
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:04.280]  And that's actually great because you have the rise of, well, web standards, period,
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:09.400]  which would not have happened if the Internet Explorer monopoly had stayed.
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:14.560]  You had Firefox and then Chrome, you had, and the thing at the moment I think about
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:21.040]  all the time is in the original iPhone demo, when Jobs gets out the iPhone and he does
[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:25.740]  the pinch and zoom on the New York Times homepage, right?
[01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:26.740]  And it is stunning.
[01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:29.620]  It's just, it's one of the, it's one of those moments in that entire, in the entire
[01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:30.920]  history of Apple, right?
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:33.160]  That Indicov tech that is stunning.
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:39.760]  And for me, that was like, well, Jeffrey Zeldman and many others had fought for web standards
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.520]  for the decade prior to that.
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:45.080]  And that was why that could render on Safari, period.
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:46.080]  And then on any platform.
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:48.340]  And the New York Times hadn't done a damn thing, right?
[01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:49.760]  It was the New York Times.
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:55.000]  And the reason it was such a great demo and so perfectly selected by Jobs was the New
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:00.240]  York Times homepage, it still is kind of recognizable.
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:05.720]  It still looks very New York Times-y and it came up on the phone and he was just the master
[01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:06.720]  of demos, right?
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:11.880]  Because he didn't belabor the point, but he brought it up.
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:16.680]  You can see it's the New York Times on the phone and it looks exactly right.
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:24.000]  So you as the viewer, everybody had the same thought was, wow, that little throne has it,
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.000]  it's real.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.640]  And then immediately you think, but it's useless, it's way too small.
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:32.800]  Not like, oh, you have to be 21 years old with perfect eyes and you can read it.
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:34.400]  Like literally nobody could use it.
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:35.400]  Nobody could read it.
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:36.400]  The pixels were too small.
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:41.120]  And then immediately he pinches to zoom or double taps, and then he was like, also you
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:42.120]  could just double tap.
[01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:43.120]  And it'll zoom in.
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:44.120]  You double tap and zoom into the image.
[01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:48.120]  And that's where the web standards angle really worked was because you could double tap on
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:55.360]  the page and it would semantically pick out the element you double tapped on.
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:58.960]  And so this is a really interesting thing because there's so much in there and obviously
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:03.760]  the greatest software or tech demo of all time, but you come back from that and there's
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:05.560]  a bunch of interesting things packed into there.
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:08.480]  First of all, like his framing of it's the real web, not the baby web.
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:11.880]  And people forget there had been WAP and all, yeah, exactly.
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:16.240]  Like all these weird junky mobile sites.
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:22.960]  But also developers and through developer culture and developer advocacy had spent a
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:27.520]  decade prior saying we need to be ready for new devices.
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:31.160]  And then eventually, you know, Ethan Marcotte and others would call it responsive web, you
[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:34.560]  know, a few years later and as it sort of came to be known.
[01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:37.920]  But this idea of we're going to embrace web standards, we're going to embrace the responsive
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:38.920]  web.
[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:44.400]  This is something that came from developers articulating a value around really freedom.
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:50.920]  Like there's this very highfalutin, you know what I mean, it's like wave the flag kind
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:51.920]  of stuff.
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:53.680]  We ought to be free and we ought to use standards.
[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:58.080]  And it was like, and I was a part of the web standards project and I was like, you know,
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:00.000]  this sounds very theoretical and very abstract.
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.120]  I don't know what we're fighting for.
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:02.440]  Why do standards on their own matter?
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:03.440]  Why does it matter?
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:06.000]  If it renders in Internet Explorer, why isn't that good enough?
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:09.080]  You know, and you have to really interrogate that, you have to challenge that.
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:13.640]  And that's sort of the mode we're in is people can't say where they're going to.
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:20.960]  Developers can't say the solution to mobile apps being fair to people and developers and
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:26.040]  users is do X, Y, Z because they couldn't, for the same reason in 2000 when I started
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:29.920]  working on the web standards project, we couldn't say, well, we want a smartphone, which didn't
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:33.320]  exist then, to be able to render the New York Times homepage.
[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:37.880]  But if everybody's building to this standard and there's an openness there and anybody
[01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:42.240]  can participate in a fair way, then experiences will be enabled like this.
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:45.720]  And actually, it's really interesting because there is no retroactive claiming.
[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:49.360]  Jobs didn't nod to thanks to web standards that we so far could do this.
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:53.160]  And nobody even in the advocacy community didn't claim it as a win.
[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:57.200]  I mean, that's what's really, really striking is like when you change developer culture,
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:59.960]  everything happens at this weird, ephemeral, non-visible level.
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:02.960]  I mean, this is why I build developer tools like this is why this is my job is like I
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:04.100]  obsess over this.
[01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:10.440]  And so in the moment we're in with the App Store, what I think are the principles that
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:15.680]  if we could get to a distillation of it is put aside consumers for a minute for developers
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:19.080]  is one, I want a level playing ground.
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:20.480]  I do want it to be the same rules.
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:22.680]  I want it to be something I can understand.
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:24.040]  And I know what I'm getting into.
[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:25.040]  What did I agree?
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:27.280]  Did I, you know, this is not a Darth Vader deal.
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:30.280]  Pray I don't alter the deal further, right?
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:31.920]  And that is what it feels like.
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:36.160]  I think I think actually everybody has some degree of consternation there.
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:39.360]  And that it doesn't actually affect most apps.
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:44.000]  It's not actually on policies that most devs are going to run into, but the uncertainty
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.040]  is the killer.
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:49.240]  And then the other part is there is different, there are different deals.
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:50.240]  It is unfair.
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:54.580]  And that's because, well, if you're Adobe or you're Epic and you're Fortnite or you're
[01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:57.400]  Microsoft with Office, they do make a different deal with you.
[01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:00.640]  If you're Facebook, they do make a different deal with you.
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:03.160]  And they can't say it, right?
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:05.720]  And before they couldn't say it because it doesn't fit Apple's aesthetic.
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:06.720]  Like we don't explain.
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:08.040]  That's not what we do.
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:10.700]  Now they can't say it because there's congressional scrutiny.
[01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:16.520]  And if you admit, you know, like, you know, Amazon's ethos can be F U. That's what we
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:17.520]  did.
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:18.520]  What's your problem?
[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:19.520]  You know what I mean?
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:23.620]  And old Microsoft definitely would be like, yes, and yeah, we did.
[01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:24.620]  So what?
[01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:25.620]  What are you going to do about it?
[01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:26.620]  Right?
[01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:27.620]  Apple can never be that.
[01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:29.560]  They don't, they don't, they don't want to communicate that way.
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:33.000]  And then I think, you know, there's a sort of idealism to it.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.440]  And so they are facing the reality of one, they do, they are a giant, they're a trillion
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:41.320]  dollar business that didn't happen that way accidentally.
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:43.600]  And they do make calls and they do make partnerships and they do compromise.
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:50.440]  I mean, it's just like, you know, Tim Cook is probably the greatest supply chain manager
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:54.600]  in human history, or at least since like Genghis Khan, right?
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:58.040]  And I think if given his druthers, he'd be like, we would like to not be in bed with
[01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:01.560]  the human rights injustices in China right now.
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:02.560]  But he's like, you know what?
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:03.560]  You got to do what you got to do.
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:04.560]  That's where he's at.
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:05.560]  Yeah.
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:06.560]  Everybody makes a choice.
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:09.040]  And I think they're in that same, same part with developer rules.
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:10.040]  Yeah.
[01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:11.560]  Well, that's, that's not a bad analogy.
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:18.900]  I get it, you know, and I, but I, I do feel that there is a, a very easily, like a lot
[01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:23.440]  of this would be very hard to unwind and could be and should be, and maybe we'll be at the
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:29.940]  point of a regulatory gun, you know, and maybe not, but there's an easier part where it really
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:34.480]  does feel like they're Darth Vadering people.
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:40.880]  And in terms of we're changing the deal and at least when Darth Vader screwed Lando for
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:46.640]  that deal, it was for the fate of the galaxy, right?
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:51.800]  Like it was, he's going to, he wants Luke, you know, like Luke, it was obvious was the
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:53.440]  key to the whole thing.
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:54.440]  Right.
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:36:00.160]  And it's, it's almost as though Darth Vader was putting the squeeze on Lando over, you
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:03.520]  know, wedge Antilles, you know, ah, yeah, he's a good pilot.
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:08.000]  You know, if you just pick your, you know, favorite star Wars nerd, obscure character,
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  like why are you doing this?
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.520]  I'm more of a Porkins guy, but sure.
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:11.520]  Right.
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:16.040]  But like, you know, with, with, with this idea that, that Apple has a team combing through
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:22.200]  the app store, looking for apps that have been in there for years, maybe 10 years, like
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:27.720]  the WordPress app has been there for over 10 years and retroactively, nefariously being
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:28.960]  like now, right.
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:34.560]  Shake down and, you know, and that, you know, companies like, and you know, disclaimers
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:40.040]  sponsor of this podcast, Squarespace and, and all the other hosting, all these things
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:46.520]  that WordPress competes with that Apple's looking at apps in that space and saying,
[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:51.240]  you have a free app that you just use that you can get in and, and you know, add content
[01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:55.240]  to your CMS and stuff like that of a paid service you're paying for outside because
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:57.040]  it's not really a thing you do on your phone.
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:02.360]  Your phone is you're just using the app as a better client than a web client would be.
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:07.360]  Why in the world are they trying to get them to do in-app purchases that they don't want
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:08.360]  to do?
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:13.920]  And then people mistakenly jump to add the polarization angle is that Apple is trying
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:18.920]  to take 30% of WordPress's money or 30% of Squarespace's number.
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:24.000]  That's not even true because they're only going after 30% of the people who would sign
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:30.000]  up through the app, which is clearly less, far less, especially for that.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  That math doesn't matter.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.360]  I mean, you're right about that, but like it just shows why people feel it, but it just
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:39.360]  shows why is Apple, why doesn't Apple see that they are, however much money they're
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:48.520]  the, the last few, the drops of cash they're getting out of this campaign are so much less
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:53.560]  in value than the brand damage they're doing to the company and brand damage.
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:58.160]  You cannot put a dollar sign on what is no, no, and, and you, to win back developer trust,
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:03.240]  like, I mean, you look at Microsoft, which was vilified by developers and now, you know,
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:09.540]  they bought GitHub and people were like, great, which is wild, but that literally, literally
[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:12.300]  took them 20 years.
[01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:14.360]  It took 20 years in billions of dollars, right?
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:19.200]  I think about the first time that Azure sponsored something you did and people were like, they
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:20.200]  did what?
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:21.200]  Right.
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:22.200]  It was, it was, Oh my God.
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:23.200]  But they're the, you know, they're the evil empire.
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:24.800]  And now people are like, yeah, Azure, sure.
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:25.800]  It's like alongside AWS.
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:26.800]  No, we did a video.
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:30.480]  It was when I did, was doing the Vesper app with Brent Simmons and Dave Wiskus and we
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:33.720]  needed a backend and iCloud storage stuff wasn't there yet.
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:34.880]  It wasn't a good option.
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:36.840]  And Azure was perfect.
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:37.840]  It was what we needed.
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:38.840]  And we talked to them.
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:39.920]  People were surprised, right?
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:43.880]  Because Microsoft was still shifting the perception about what they were.
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:48.600]  And the point was that, and that was, that was developer culture debt that they had been
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:51.680]  paying down for the better part of two decades at that point.
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:57.120]  And to the tune of billions of dollars invested and, and, and, and Apple was on the cusp of
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:59.320]  making a mistake like that.
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:00.520]  I really believe that.
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:03.640]  I really believe that because right now developers kind of like them, even though, you know,
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:05.280]  there's all the, there's all those complaints, blah, blah, blah.
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:07.680]  But right now there's actually a lot of positive affinity.
[01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:14.600]  And also on the cusp of the, you know, the Apple Silicon systems coming out and, and
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:17.480]  this sort of revolution that I think is going to come, that is so exciting.
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:21.000]  I guess actually one of the most exciting things in Apple history.
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000]  Right.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.940]  And, and, and, and you're like for, for like, don't make this mistake for small money.
[01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:31.520]  If it were for, you know, $50 billion, all right, have a conversation, right?
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:35.520]  If it's for a nickel and dime under Matt Mullenweg's couch on the WordPress app, why are you doing
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:36.520]  it?
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:43.680]  And so what I come back to out of it is you first principles, like what did jobs say when
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:44.680]  the app store came out?
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:45.840]  Look, we're not trying to make money off.
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:48.040]  He said it, we're not trying to make money off of this thing.
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:50.280]  We want to, we want to make sure it's good quality stuff.
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:54.560]  We want to make sure there's no viruses and junk and malware on there, spyware, whatever,
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:55.560]  right?
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:57.680]  Like that's kind of what I'm paraphrasing, but it's almost exactly what he said.
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:00.100]  You don't want to go to make a phone call and then your phone doesn't work because you
[01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:01.100]  installed something.
[01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:04.320]  And he said, you know, and we're just covering our costs.
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:05.320]  Like we got to host it.
[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:06.320]  We got to provide it.
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:07.320]  All the free ones are going to be free.
[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:09.080]  So we want to subsidize that.
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:11.280]  And it was such a strong argument.
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:12.280]  It was such a strong argument.
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:15.020]  And I was one of those people where like everybody around me is like, man, they're going to try
[01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:16.020]  to control everything.
[01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:17.020]  And why can't there be this?
[01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:18.020]  And why can't there be that?
[01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:20.680]  And I was like, look, I think this is a really valuable thing to add into the ecosystem.
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:25.140]  And I, you know, my perspective was coming off of, you know, I was much more on the Windows
[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:26.140]  side those days.
[01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:29.120]  And I just switched to the Mac right before that, I think.
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:32.400]  But it was like trustworthy computing at Microsoft.
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:36.400]  And they had done the big push on like, we're going to stop all development on Windows XP
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:38.640]  and just redo it to not have viruses all the time.
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:43.440]  And, you know, every day was an Internet Explorer bug or Outlook bug or whatever it was.
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:44.440]  Right.
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:46.720]  And so they were right in saying, here's this other model.
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:48.360]  And that was the world that came out of.
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:51.040]  And they were right in saying, we're just covering our costs.
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:53.560]  It's not a revenue driver for us.
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:54.560]  Right.
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:59.040]  And what I don't I think they were naive about was the move to paid services.
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:04.700]  And most importantly, I think what, you know, the thing I it's such a it's weird because
[01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:09.400]  it's actually like almost moving to me, even though I'm as cynical as anybody.
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:14.800]  You set up a Mac, you set up an iPhone and it says in the start screen, privacy is a
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:16.280]  human right.
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:24.360]  And the boldness of declaring human rights as a thing you even care about when you've
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:30.200]  unboxed your device is still that is like that is the period like that is the best distillation
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:33.800]  of like anybody in technology of what you want to do is you say these are rights and
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:35.120]  this is what we do about it.
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:36.120]  Right.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:43.800]  And then you come back out of that into where they where they lost the plot on this is is
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:49.320]  is that there are principles that fundamental underlying why you have an app store that
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:53.880]  is about protecting music experience and data and all these kinds of things.
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:58.280]  And actually, one of the most important parts is the framing.
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:41:59.280]  So many people view this.
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:06.060]  If you're not paying for the product, you are the product apps that are paid are important
[01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:10.300]  because they sustain creators to make them apps that are subscriptions are even more
[01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:14.160]  important because they sustain creators over time and for coders to be able to keep making
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:15.160]  it over time.
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:19.200]  And without that, you end up with the anti-pattern of in-app purchases, which are extractive
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:22.880]  and even worse, you end up with ad based surveillance, which everybody's doing.
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:27.560]  And we've normalized, but it's incredibly destructive and his intention with the human
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:32.280]  rights declaration that Apple makes the first time you open up any of their products.
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:36.080]  And like this is actually the but this is the thing like if I have Tim Cook on the phone,
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:38.780]  this is what I would tell him is real simple.
[01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:41.100]  You say privacy is a human right.
[01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:47.160]  We have ad surveillance that is violating people's human right to privacy on your platform.
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:52.640]  The most reasonable, understandable way to undo that is subscription based products.
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:57.000]  And you have put a chill on the entire subscription based market by introducing uncertainty for
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.600]  no reason and no benefit to your company.
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:00.600]  Right.
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:01.600]  That's the argument.
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:02.600]  Right.
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:05.700]  And it's funny because my one of my things that I don't want to go too far into the Epic
[01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:09.640]  Fortnight thing, because I talked about it in my last episode and we have limited time.
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:16.320]  But I think it's so weird from Epic's part that they didn't foresee the threat to Unreal
[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:23.840]  Engine and their responsibility as the platform vendor to that, that you have to, you know,
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:26.880]  you need certainty to develop.
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:31.320]  And the thing with Unreal Engine is it's like, sure, there's hobbyists who are using it to
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:32.320]  make hobbyist games.
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:36.280]  But, you know, it's used by people with, you know, budgets for their games.
[01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:41.800]  Billions of dollars created by tens of millions of dollars budget and, you know, hundreds
[01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:47.000]  of millions up to billions of dollars in potential revenue from the big games, you need to depend
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  on it.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.200]  And yet Apple on the other side of the exact same argument is the one who's also reducing
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:57.700]  the dependability of their platform that, hey, we had this app or, you know, and that's
[01:43:57.700 --> 01:44:05.040]  why the hey situation is so clarifying, because I think that their fundamental argument that,
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:11.040]  hey, we've been doing this with Basecamp for 10 years and we have an email thing that we
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:15.040]  wanted to do the exact same way and now you're telling us we can't because this one's email
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:17.480]  and that one is project management.
[01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:21.600]  And I think that's so fundamentally clear and true.
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:26.400]  And the way that, you know, there was an interview Jason Fried did with Jason Calacanis on his
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:29.040]  podcast where he said, you know, if this turned out the wrong way, I was thinking about just
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:30.960]  retiring because I don't need, I don't need this.
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:35.200]  I don't, I didn't get into business to have somebody tell me what to do.
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:41.720]  And it's just, it's the fact that they just assumed that it would, you know, and putting
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:45.120]  aside whether they could take signups in the app, they're like, fine, we didn't do it with
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:46.120]  Basecamp.
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:47.120]  We'll sign people up on our website.
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:49.440]  We can get our own customers and we'll just have a client.
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:53.720]  And the fact that Apple doesn't see that, this entitlement that they express in a lot
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:59.360]  of their few public statements on these things where they express a sort of why aren't these
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:05.560]  developers grateful for us for developing these tools that Apple themselves needs to
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:07.000]  make their own apps, right?
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.120]  That's the benefit of this that, you know, they make the other, you know, Epic isn't
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:13.800]  grateful for metal, but Apple's using metal.
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:17.880]  And the fact that developers get to use it, the whole dog food thing is what makes the
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:18.940]  platform work.
[01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:24.960]  But why doesn't Apple see that even the free apps make the platform better, right?
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:32.640]  That if you have a great WordPress client for your iPhone that is better than going
[01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:39.640]  through the mobile website on the same phone is a net benefit for everybody.
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:44.920]  It's a win-win-win WordPress and all the WordPress open source sites and other people who aren't
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:47.760]  related to the company automatic.
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:52.360]  Everybody with WordPress installed, which is like a third of the web, has a client they
[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:55.920]  can get on the iPhone, and it's a better experience.
[01:45:55.920 --> 01:46:00.060]  So the user benefits, they have a better experience for managing the website.
[01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:06.640]  And Apple benefits because their platform has a great client that's better than the
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:08.880]  web for managing WordPress sites.
[01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:10.160]  It's win-win-win all around.
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:13.640]  Why in the world are you trying to squeeze 30% of the money out of people who aren't
[01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:16.160]  going to sign up in the app anyway?
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:20.020]  Nobody's going to sign up to make a website for their company through the app.
[01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:21.020]  It's crazy.
[01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:22.020]  Yeah, it's not going to happen.
[01:46:22.020 --> 01:46:26.600]  So you look at what are you trying to enable in the world, right?
[01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:32.880]  And I think if you're Apple, I assume, I don't know these guys personally, but you want more
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:34.560]  base camps in the world.
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:38.960]  You want more automatics in the world, but these are good, and I happen to know the founders
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:45.460]  of base camp and automatic for 20 years too, but these are good software developers, right?
[01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:49.760]  These are people that make the tools we use, their business models make sense, they are
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:55.600]  not enabling widespread misinformation and violence, they're not doing all the terrible
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:56.600]  things.
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:59.840]  They're like, we made you a tool, you use it to your job, you pay us some money, Bob's
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:00.840]  your uncle, all's good.
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:01.840]  You know what I mean?
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:04.560]  I was like, yeah, all day long, more software like that, please.
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:07.680]  Run by thoughtful people, great, even better, right?
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:08.680]  That's what you want.
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:10.680]  That's what you want your software development ecosystem to be.
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:12.920]  And then I look at it and I got a dog in this fight, right?
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:16.480]  I make a tool that lets people make stuff on the web, and it's very intentional that
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:19.520]  we built a platform for the open web.
[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:21.680]  We think that's valuable.
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:28.640]  But even putting that concern aside, as a developer, and I've developed for every platform
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:34.480]  really over the course of my career, when you develop for a proprietary platform, it
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:40.480]  is in some ways fundamentally a sharecropper position.
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:45.040]  It is an extractive position, because you are creating value to that platform owner,
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:50.560]  and you are trusting them to reciprocate enough value and kind, where you're going to be able
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:54.360]  to make a living and your users are going to benefit, and over time, the value occurs
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:55.360]  to you.
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:58.880]  And this is why, whether it's Sherlocking or bundling or tying, those things are so
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:03.480]  fraught, because it violates that trust, and it also reveals the thing that everybody is
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:06.120]  not talking about, which is there is a fundamental tension.
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:09.400]  If you make enough money on any platform, the platform will integrate that thing.
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:12.320]  They will either buy you or they'll compete with you, right?
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:15.480]  Because if it's that much value on the platform, they can't let it go outside.
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:19.880]  I think about this a lot of times, like, yeah, put aside Basecamp and Automattic, Adobe made
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:21.880]  its bones on the Mac platform.
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:24.960]  That's how it became a global software titan.
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:29.320]  But you couldn't make Adobe today on iOS.
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:32.600]  If you extracted that much value, they would bundle you or they would buy you or they would
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:34.920]  compete with you and shut you down.
[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:39.920]  And then the inverse of that is, nobody can argue, it's pretty good now, but nobody can
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:44.280]  argue, V1 of Apple Maps got millions of users on merit.
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:46.720]  Nobody would argue that, right?
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:50.080]  And maybe it got an unfair time or whatever, but there's nobody that's like, oh, I made
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:54.600]  a considered decision, I looked at all the options, and most people chose this thing.
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:59.600]  And so there is a thumb on the scale with bundling and tying.
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:04.480]  And this was the Microsoft issue, this is the Apple issue now, which gets to, if you
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:08.800]  reveal that your thumb is on the scale in two ways, one of which is you're only allowed
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:16.680]  to make a certain ceiling of revenue before, or in a certain strategic category, before
[01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:22.000]  we will subsume you one way or the other, either increase the tariff or bundle you or,
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:27.080]  you know, compete you out, or the other issue, which is that, well, we can choose what we
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:29.680]  bundle and what's in here and what we compete with you.
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:32.880]  Anytime you reveal that, developers have to still feel like they're not threatened by
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:33.880]  it.
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:36.560]  And the way you get there is certainty in defining, this is where the platform goes
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:38.160]  and this is where it doesn't go.
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:43.840]  These are the boundaries that are there, or, or at the very least, document the interface.
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:45.400]  If you'd like to swap out, here's what you do.
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:47.160]  Now there's problems around that, around user experience.
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:51.160]  This is where Apple, you know, I think has had a very good point of view, which is, you
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:54.480]  know, the experience on the Android phones when you would like open a photo and it'd
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:57.360]  be like, here's your first time using the phone, here's five different photo apps, what
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:49:58.360]  do you want to use?
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:49:59.360]  Terrible.
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:00.360]  Nobody wants that.
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:01.360]  And it's bad for users.
[01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:03.400]  And then there's this fundamental thing that goes back to the thing we talked about with
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:05.400]  the regulation and policy.
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:10.720]  We look at competitive markets as if you can substitute, you know, X for Y, code for Pepsi.
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:11.720]  Right.
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:16.080]  And, and the truth is things blur that line all the time and in the, in the Microsoft
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:21.120]  Internet Explorer era, they were characteristically just petulant about it.
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:25.000]  They were like little children where they were like, oh, we can't put a browser in it.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:28.320]  Well, then we're gonna take the browser engine out and we're gonna break all your apps, right?
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:33.200]  Because you need to have both the app instance, the user facing instance and the system component
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:34.200]  capability.
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:38.240]  And we look at that on, on, you know, iOS and it's like the camera is both a system
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:40.760]  capability and an app.
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:45.760]  And you know, the WebKit so far is both a system capability and a user facing app.
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:47.600]  And so we have all these things that are both.
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:53.740]  And the, the thing about that is internally, internal to a big company, everything that
[01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:59.240]  becomes sufficiently used by users will reflexively be seen as, well, we have to have that on
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:00.240]  the platform.
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:01.240]  Of course we do.
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:02.240]  Why would we want to deny anybody that?
[01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:03.240]  Because it becomes successful.
[01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:04.240]  Right?
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:07.120]  And so there's a definitional creep that happens.
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:11.200]  You just, you just agglomerate it's, it's, it's, you know, colonialism or like you just,
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:12.960]  well, of course it has to be ours.
[01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:14.540]  If we don't do it, then somebody else could do it.
[01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:15.800]  And then that would be bad.
[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:21.200]  And again, not to relitigate an old war, but postscript was proprietary to Adobe and they
[01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:27.280]  licensed it and everybody's fonts printed out real bit mappy before.
[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:32.960]  And then with post map, they came out of your laser printer smooth and then Apple and Adobe
[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:36.200]  or Apple and Microsoft sort of were like, well, we need our own thing like that and
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:37.240]  we don't want to pay Adobe.
[01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:38.420]  So they made true type.
[01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:42.840]  And I know I'm simplifying this argument greatly, but Adobe was like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:48.320]  We own vector output of fonts and you know, and it's like, no, of course once, once you
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:50.400]  see it, you have to have it, it has to be built in.
[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:55.040]  And the idea that you would need third party software to get smooth vector font output,
[01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:57.520]  it's just like in hindsight, it's like, yeah, of course it was going to be built in.
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:51:59.000]  Yeah.
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:03.120]  And so that, I think that pattern just keeps repeating, which is like, if you want to long
[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:08.120]  term have developer trust and you want to do right by your consumers, you have to define
[01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:12.160]  the boundaries around the terms by which you will either expand your grasp and pull in
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:17.520]  those things or that you will kill off third parties or that you will change the economics
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:18.640]  for devs.
[01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:24.040]  And there, because Apple doesn't proactively communicate, like that's not ever their style,
[01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:29.320]  like they just say what they say on their schedule, it feeds the uncertainty.
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:30.320]  Yeah.
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:32.320]  And, and also they are shifting, right?
[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:36.640]  The Apple is more open these days and they do engage more these days and you know, there's
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:40.280]  been this shift, but they're still, they don't know where they're going to about what their
[01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:42.480]  communication style to developers will be.
[01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:44.520]  They know they're more open than they used to be.
[01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:48.600]  And I think that the stunning moment on that was talking about the Mac Pro roadmap, right?
[01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:53.300]  Like that was such a change and it was like for the better, I actually think it's great,
[01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:57.520]  but they don't, they're like, okay, we're, we're still closed by default and communication.
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:02.320]  We are slightly over open when there's something really egregious, but only in certain categories,
[01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:03.320]  right?
[01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:04.640]  You wouldn't do that about the butterfly keyboard.
[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:07.760]  You wouldn't do that about, you know, Intenagate back in the day.
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:11.440]  Like there's still categories where we're like, we don't dignify that with a response.
[01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:13.960]  And this thing is so diffused to your point.
[01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:17.560]  It's so fuzzy that you can't say to a developer, well, we're going to do X or Y, right?
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:23.240]  The only time you get that Christmas of answer is if you're Taylor Swift or if it's so acute,
[01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:27.280]  you know, where I love the idea that DHH and Taylor Swift are in the same category.
[01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:28.560]  That's fascinating to me.
[01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:29.560]  Right.
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:33.800]  And in DHH's case, it's like inadvertently, cause I don't, I love DHH and Jason Fried,
[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:38.480]  but like, there's no way they were so clever that they timed the hay thing that well to
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:39.840]  be right before, you know,
[01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:44.960]  No, in fact, I know it was going to come out before, but it was postponed by the coronavirus
[01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:48.040]  and the quarantine, you know, would have been lucky.
[01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:53.700]  But if on the, on the Eve of your big developer event, you have incredibly respected, visible
[01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:58.440]  developers saying we got completely screwed and we tried to follow the rules, that is
[01:53:58.440 --> 01:53:59.880]  your worst case scenario.
[01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:02.520]  In a way that you really add a common sense level.
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:04.760]  Most people really saw it on their side.
[01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:07.080]  It really, you know, there's a very common sense.
[01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:08.080]  No brainer.
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:09.080]  Cut and dry.
[01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:10.080]  All right.
[01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:11.080]  Let me take one last break here.
[01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:12.720]  I got a fourth and final sponsor.
[01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:15.040]  Oh, let me tell you about our friends.
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:16.040]  It's Squarespace.
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:21.280]  Look, you know, Squarespace, if you listen to the show, they sponsor often they're a
[01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:29.560]  great company with a great product all in one, everything you need web hosting, uh,
[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:35.760]  for your site, including domain name registration, ability to host a blog, the ability to host
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:42.160]  a podcast, the ability to host a portfolio of your design work, the ability to host your
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:47.060]  own store where you sell stuff and have the e-commerce go through the site without you
[01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:49.980]  being an e-commerce expert or a developer.
[01:54:49.980 --> 01:54:54.420]  You do it all by drag and drop, WYSIWYG right there on the screen.
[01:54:54.420 --> 01:55:01.360]  What you see is what you get because when you're designing and tweaking and moving around
[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:06.740]  and manipulating your website as the owner who's designing it, you're doing the real
[01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:11.920]  thing with the real website that everybody else sees without the admin abilities.
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:12.920]  It's that simple.
[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:13.920]  It's that real.
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:14.920]  It's that direct.
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:19.860]  And if you are, as you might be listening to this show, the sort of person who knows
[01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:26.160]  things like how to code HTML and CSS and JavaScript, you can get in there at any place you want
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:31.600]  and do your own thing at that code level if you want.
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:35.360]  But if you're not, if you don't know the difference between CSS and JavaScript, you're fine.
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:37.140]  You can do the whole thing graphically.
[01:55:37.140 --> 01:55:44.860]  That's how Squarespace spans the gamut from expert to not expert, hosts it all, and really
[01:55:44.860 --> 01:55:50.220]  great award-winning tech support, everything you could possibly want, great analytics,
[01:55:50.220 --> 01:55:52.600]  everything you could possibly want.
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:54.560]  And where do you go to find out more?

[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:14.720]  So my thanks to Squarespace.
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:19.600]  Go to squarespace.com slash talk show, and remember that code talk show to save 10% off
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:20.960]  your first order.
[01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:23.960]  My thanks to Squarespace for their continuing support of the talk show.
[01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:25.980]  Here, let me read this quote.
[01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:31.840]  And it's from Francisco Tolmaski, who was on the mobile Safari team at Apple when the
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:37.560]  original iPhone came out, and he's a very astute critic of the current App Store situation.
[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:42.880]  Remember, Apple's iOS rules would not have allowed for the invention of the web browser.
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:43.920]  Let that sink in.
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:47.880]  They would have rejected one of the most important technical innovations in the history of computing.
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:54.960]  Microsoft's bully tactic of making IE free seems quaint in comparison.
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:57:01.000]  And if you had the basic idea, if you had an idea that is to today's mobile web what
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:06.840]  the web browser was to the desktop, Apple wouldn't approve it on iOS.
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:08.160]  And I think that's true.
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:11.160]  It's fundamentally true.
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:16.920]  And it's a good way of espousing an argument that people have of there should be some way,
[01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:21.280]  something outside the App Store, whether you call it sideloading or whatever you want to
[01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:27.320]  do, but some way that if somebody wanted to write software to run on iPhones that isn't
[01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:31.920]  compatible with the control, again, skipping the money, right, nothing to do with money.
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:37.120]  I have a great idea, but it's incompatible with the rules, and it would be awesome.
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:39.280]  This is fundamentally broken.
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:40.760]  And I get it, right?
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:44.040]  And I think that there's people who are like, why don't I get it?
[01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:45.040]  Why don't you see that?
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:46.040]  I do.
[01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:47.040]  I do.
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:48.540]  But it's a tradeoff, right?
[01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:53.320]  There's also the fact that the freedom to write software at that level, the freedom
[01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:58.920]  for Adobe to write the PostScript extension for Mac OS that boots as the system boots,
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:06.960]  so that the, and what was it, ATM, Adobe Type Manager, that rendered anti-aliased fonts
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:11.400]  before the system could do it, so that the fonts actually looked good.
[01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:12.400]  And it was amazing.
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:13.400]  It was the future.
[01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:19.440]  But it was a third party that rendered your PostScript fonts on screen in the operating
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:20.440]  system.
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:21.440]  I mean, that was fabulous.
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:22.440]  It's unbelievable.
[01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:23.760]  And it was great.
[01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:26.720]  And it moved the industry forward.
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:33.200]  But having the ability to install software at that level is also what led to malware.
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:35.960]  And again, and I know malware is sort of scary.
[01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:36.960]  And system instability.
[01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:37.960]  Yeah.
[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:38.960]  System instability.
[01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:39.960]  Disable all your extensions.
[01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:40.960]  Right.
[01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:47.280]  And it's at the enthusiast level where we coasted through that era knowing that we could
[01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:51.360]  manage our computers and were careful about what we installed and knew how to fix things
[01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:55.960]  if they went wrong and it wasn't like our lives were over if we had to start over with
[01:58:55.960 --> 01:58:58.560]  a new computer or whatever.
[01:58:58.560 --> 01:58:59.960]  Normal people aren't like that.
[01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:05.800]  And like the encapsulation of computing into something where you can feel 100% confident
[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:09.980]  that there is no way to mess up your iPhone is also a thing.
[01:59:09.980 --> 01:59:10.980]  They're both things.
[01:59:10.980 --> 01:59:11.980]  Right?
[01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:19.600]  It is an absolute truth that part of the success of the iPhone isn't despite Apple's control
[01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:22.260]  over every bit of software you can install.
[01:59:22.260 --> 01:59:24.460]  It's because of it.
[01:59:24.460 --> 01:59:30.080]  And yet that same control is what keeps a third party like if Glitch, if your company
[01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:36.680]  came up with an idea that would Glitchify the OS, I mean, just because you're here.
[01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:42.000]  It's not outlandish that you would, but it would involve allowing anybody to program
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.160]  and put apps on it through Glitch on the phone.
[01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:47.080]  It's not going to go through the app store, right?
[01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:48.800]  It's just not, they're not going to let it.
[01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:50.480]  So how do we square that?
[01:59:50.480 --> 01:59:53.480]  How do we, how do we deal with this where both of, you know, how do we deal with the
[01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:57.120]  cognitive dissonance that both of these things are true?
[01:59:57.120 --> 02:00:01.760]  So there's, there's a, there's a real tension here because iOS devices are not general computing
[02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:02.760]  devices.
[02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:04.720]  They're not, they're not designed to be.
[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:07.700]  And people go nuts when I say this, and now they're going to go after you.
[02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:08.700]  Thank you for saying that.
[02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:09.700]  That's fine.
[02:00:09.700 --> 02:00:13.720]  I mean, but there, well, and I think that's actually a thing that's worth understanding,
[02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:20.720]  which is like the computer in your car is not a general computing device, right?
[02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:23.920]  Most computers in our lives are not general computing devices, right?
[02:00:23.920 --> 02:00:26.760]  There's one in your microwave and there's one in your car and there's one in your smart
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:30.520]  speaker and none of them are general computing devices.
[02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:35.460]  But our expectations as developers are defined by general computing devices.
[02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:38.120]  And we see how they all could be, right?
[02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:40.960]  It's easy to see how the iPhone could do that.
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:45.520]  People do take apart whatever your clock radio and they're like, I got it to run Linux.
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:46.520]  Okay, cool, cool.
[02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:47.520]  That's great.
[02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:51.680]  But like, like the fact that it is hackable is a different thing and it has a different
[02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:55.960]  purpose and, and, and it would not occur to anybody to be like, my microwave computer
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:01:00.020]  does not stream Spotify and it's as an injustice, right?
[02:01:00.020 --> 02:01:07.000]  And so, so, so, but the nature of it is that, and I think this is the non-obvious part because
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:11.200]  all the way back to the conversation about the command line and real computers, right?
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:15.160]  Everybody who can make apps on iOS is, is somebody that's comfortable on the command
[02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:16.160]  line at some point, right?
[02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:20.040]  Like at some point you drop down and do it, you write code at some point.
[02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:27.040]  And so for a developer, an iPhone or an iPad is a general computing device.
[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:31.320]  If you have an Apple developer account and you have Xcode, it is.
[02:01:31.320 --> 02:01:32.800]  You can do whatever you want.
[02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:35.160]  It is a device that can do whatever you want.
[02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:41.200]  And so that's something that's really, that's, I think that cognitive tension between my
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:45.600]  users can't experience it as whatever I can imagine, but I can experience what I imagine
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:47.600]  because I can see under the hood.
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:53.040]  I can see the Unix under the hood and, and, and like that thing, which is like, Apple
[02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:58.840]  could articulate these principles, which is like, nobody expects, why can't I do any random
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:00.400]  thing on a Nintendo switch?
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:02.480]  Nobody, nobody's even mad about it.
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:03.480]  Right.
[02:02:03.480 --> 02:02:04.480]  Like doesn't even occur to them.
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:05.480]  Right.
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:09.960]  And, and, and, and, you know, the, the iPhone is an app console, right?
[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:12.160]  It is, it is a different thing.
[02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:16.160]  And then the hardest tension with that comes from the fact that one of the apps on the
[02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:17.600]  console is a web browser.
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:18.600]  Right.
[02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:21.400]  And, and, and that changes our expectations again.
[02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:24.600]  And again, I don't even remember if the switch has a web browser, but like the old Nintendo,
[02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:25.600]  the Wii did.
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:26.600]  Yeah.
[02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:27.600]  Yeah.
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:29.280]  I mean, the fact is I don't even care because it wouldn't occur to me to browse the web
[02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:30.520]  on the damn thing because who cares?
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:31.520]  Right.
[02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:34.040]  That's what people always, when I bring up this app console metaphor, they're like, well,
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:35.800]  when's the last time you browse the web on your switch?
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:38.760]  And I'm like, I agree, but that's not, that's not what I'm saying.
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:40.760]  I'm not saying the task.
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:41.760]  Right.
[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:42.760]  Yeah.
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:43.760]  And so I'll bring it all the way back.
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:47.280]  I think, you know, none of these original arguments, but, but when we make that argument,
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:57.040]  the, the question is like one will developers ever be comfortable with a general, what looks
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:01.400]  like a general purpose device that is not a general purpose computer.
[02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:02.400]  And the answer is no.
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:06.320]  Like they can't be because we have all tasted of the forbidden fruit.
[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:07.320]  Do you know what I mean?
[02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:10.320]  And I'm old enough where it's like, I had computers that booted into a command line.
[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:11.960]  If you couldn't code, you couldn't do anything with it.
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:13.960]  You can do jack shit with it.
[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:14.960]  Right.
[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:18.440]  But you come all the way to this era and you're like, I know there's a computer lurking in
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:19.440]  there.
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:23.200]  And, and it is so tantalizingly close that it is frustrating.
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:24.200]  They can't get to it.
[02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:29.520]  And, and the best analog to these products on Android, you kind of can't now it's still
[02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:31.200]  flawed and all these other reasons.
[02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:32.840]  And, and it does introduce a risk.
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:37.200]  And I think that's sort of this thing of like the fundamental emotional tension of like,
[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:40.240]  I can see, I can see through the window, right.
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:44.240]  Or it's people through the keyhole to the place I want to be, but you won't let me go
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:46.440]  there cause you say, I'll hurt myself.
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:47.440]  Right.
[02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:50.400]  And, and, and the truth of it is Apple is right.
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:55.600]  Like there would be millions more people in the world whose data would be stolen or credit
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:03:59.920]  cards would be leaked if Apple unlock the platform like that as a risk.
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:04.880]  But there are also, for example, millions of people who can't do work as sex workers
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:09.040]  because they, they, an iPhone won't let them use apps that they want to use for payment.
[02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:10.040]  Right.
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:11.040]  Right.
[02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:13.760]  And, and there are people who can't, all these categories, right, the things you just can't
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:14.760]  do.
[02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:19.520]  And a lot of us don't bump into them that much, but you, you feel it and developers
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:22.840]  are this sort of leading edge where they can, and it's interesting cause they articulate
[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:24.600]  it in terms of their own needs.
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:25.600]  Right.
[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:30.080]  And, but I think what they're fighting for is like, but a user would want to do X, would
[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:34.240]  want to be able to send their data to this place that's too hard right now or run an
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:35.240]  app that's not fun.
[02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:41.120]  I think like the very, very simple, clear example to me is game emulators, like a licensed
[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:43.880]  classic video game emulator, the Atari 2600.
[02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:44.880]  Yeah.
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:45.880]  Right.
[02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:49.720]  It is madness that there's not a really good Atari 2600 emulator that could just include
[02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:53.640]  the games that you want, you know, Pitfall and Pac-Man and you could just play it.
[02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:55.640]  And there's a lot of reasons why, right.
[02:04:55.640 --> 02:04:58.640]  And it's like, Oh, but it encourages piracy and all these kinds of things, but also low
[02:04:58.640 --> 02:05:02.880]  level system access, you know, below the level of the APIs that they don't want you to get
[02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:05.520]  to because to make it perform it, you probably would have to do that.
[02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:07.000]  Nah, I don't think you would.
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:10.560]  Maybe not with Metal anymore, but, but, but that, that historically was an argument, but
[02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:12.800]  there's a lot of reasons why we get, why they didn't do it.
[02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:17.520]  It gets into that risky category and all those things to say is like, there's a, there's
[02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:18.520]  a paternalism.
[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:19.520]  There's a, we know better.
[02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:20.520]  Yes.
[02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:21.520]  Right.
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:24.940]  And I think people are chafing at the, we know better, even though I think developers
[02:05:24.940 --> 02:05:29.240]  would agree develop the users left to their own devices will put their data at risk, will
[02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:31.760]  do weird, foolish things with their device.
[02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:36.140]  If you let them, I think actually it was a triumph that they could go a decade plus without
[02:05:36.140 --> 02:05:41.280]  having to put a file manager on iOS, like that's fantastic.
[02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:42.280]  And it's great.
[02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:47.000]  And in some ways kind of, I know that again, this is a whole show, but in some ways kind
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:50.000]  of made it worse by adding it, you know, that, that there was,
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:51.000]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:52.880]  We have to, you know, they have two things, right.
[02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:57.920]  And I've just using an app the other day where there's, it, it both tries to span.
[02:05:57.920 --> 02:06:00.480]  I don't want to mention it cause I don't want to throw under the bus cause I think there's
[02:06:00.480 --> 02:06:05.560]  a noble effort, but they're trying to span the, everything is in the app in a library,
[02:06:05.560 --> 02:06:11.000]  like Apple notes, but also you can open files and it's like, uh, and all of a sudden it's
[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:12.880]  like, where's the thing I'm typing in right now?
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:14.920]  Is this one of the files or is it in the library?
[02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:17.120]  And it's like, you kind of can't have it both ways.
[02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:18.120]  No.
[02:06:18.120 --> 02:06:19.120]  Yeah.
[02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:20.920]  You don't want to have a mental model of what their data storage is.
[02:06:20.920 --> 02:06:24.200]  But yeah, and that's sort of it is there's this abstraction and that's actually, that's
[02:06:24.200 --> 02:06:28.420]  the underlying thing, which is what feels like paternalism to a dev is actually a level
[02:06:28.420 --> 02:06:34.360]  of abstraction, a way of concerns about technology that enables a wider audience.
[02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:40.400]  And when you had to go to the file menu and choose open, that precluded a billion people
[02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:43.440]  from being able to understand how to use their device.
[02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:46.720]  And people don't want to reckon with that cause like we get it, not only do I know what's
[02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:49.520]  in the file system, I know what's under the file system, right?
[02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:53.240]  And it's like, but that's not where people want to live their life.
[02:06:53.240 --> 02:06:56.880]  And you know, you know, this too, you know, this too, it's still to this day, you cannot
[02:06:56.880 --> 02:06:59.680]  talk to normal people about the difference between Ram and storage.
[02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:00.680]  It's all memory, right?
[02:07:00.680 --> 02:07:01.680]  No, but it's weird.
[02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:03.580]  And it may be, maybe that's right.
[02:07:03.580 --> 02:07:07.360]  Maybe it's a weird glitch in the English language that we have this word memory.
[02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:08.360]  That means both.
[02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:13.160]  But I suspect linguistically, it probably is true in a lot of languages, but it's remembering
[02:07:13.160 --> 02:07:16.600]  the thing it's, you know, but is it remembering a thing and you turn the power off and it
[02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:19.640]  goes away or remembering a thing and you turn the power off and it's still there.
[02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:22.400]  And it's like, you try to explain this to people and they're like, what?
[02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:23.400]  You know?
[02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:24.400]  And it's like, Oh yeah.
[02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:25.400]  Yeah.
[02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:26.400]  And all these, right.
[02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:27.400]  All these concepts of like abstraction are very hard.
[02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:30.560]  And the weird thing, I say this all the time on the glitch side of things, which is like,
[02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:33.060]  I'm like the hardest part of coding is not the coding.
[02:07:33.060 --> 02:07:35.120]  It's everything else around, right?
[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:38.120]  It's understanding all the concepts and the setting up redevelopment environment, all
[02:07:38.120 --> 02:07:39.120]  these kinds of things.
[02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:41.600]  And it's like, cause it's like reading the code is like reading algebra and a lot of
[02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:43.080]  people can do that.
[02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:44.080]  You know?
[02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:47.040]  And so that's such an interesting thing to me is like this keeps coming up over and over,
[02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:52.240]  which is like, we think we ignore the complexity of the abstractions we're living around in
[02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:53.240]  favor of party.
[02:07:53.240 --> 02:07:54.420]  The part that seems easy to us.
[02:07:54.420 --> 02:07:57.120]  So I mentioned this, all right, defending that it's hard.
[02:07:57.120 --> 02:07:58.120]  Yeah.
[02:07:58.120 --> 02:08:00.240]  I mentioned this to a friend and they didn't even realize it worked like this, but in,
[02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:02.000]  and in turn, again, I don't have a solution.
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:07.600]  There is no easy answer, but why does Apple insist that everything subscriptions go through
[02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:09.680]  their payment system if it's in the app?
[02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:12.600]  Well, the, the cynical answer is because they want 30% of it.
[02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:13.680]  And that is true.
[02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:18.400]  And I think part of whatever Apple can undo this is by starting to say, we, we're not
[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:23.400]  going to, it will take it, we will, you know, but we'll also make it easy to do this outside
[02:08:23.400 --> 02:08:24.400]  the app.
[02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:25.400]  Right.
[02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:31.740]  And, and it's that Netflix hay model of you can take signups on your website, outside
[02:08:31.740 --> 02:08:35.720]  the app, and then you can have an app where people just sign in and use the service and
[02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:38.340]  we don't get a penny because you signed up outside.
[02:08:38.340 --> 02:08:44.580]  But if you sign up in the app, you do it our way and we take our 30% and here's, here's
[02:08:44.580 --> 02:08:46.360]  an idea of this encapsulation.
[02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:49.920]  So I've complained publicly about the New York times and I'll throw them under the bus
[02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:53.440]  cause I love the company and I love the newspaper, but I'm a subscriber and I've been a subscriber
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:54.440]  for a while.
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:57.600]  But if you want to unsubscribe from the New York times digital, you have to call them
[02:08:57.600 --> 02:09:02.840]  on the telephone and you talk to somebody whose job it is to keep you from unsubscribing
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:07.360]  and it takes, and people have gotten out or told me they've done it, you know, and, and
[02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:10.840]  it, it's like the minimum amount of time it takes is like 40 minutes.
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:11.840]  It's ridiculous.
[02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:12.840]  Yeah.
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:13.840]  Yeah.
[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:14.840]  It's a half hour of your life.
[02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:18.160]  If somebody, if you subscribe to the New York times in the app on your phone, you go to
[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:24.160]  I, you know, I cloud subscriptions, New York times unsubscribe and you are unsubscribed.
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:27.440]  It's you know, so, so this is, this is actually another really good example.
[02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:28.440]  That's all true.
[02:09:28.440 --> 02:09:33.080]  And, and, and, and, you know, for Apple, the argument of we have to be mediators on payment
[02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:40.440]  because we'll offer a better experience and we'll get our 30% both are true, right?
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:44.200]  Like their economic incentive is aligned with their user experience incentive.
[02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:49.400]  And one of the hardest parts of this for third party developers is the use case you just
[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:50.400]  talked about.
[02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:51.400]  They're like, well, I don't do that.
[02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:52.400]  Right.
[02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:56.140]  Apple is trying to protect the ecosystem from the overall harm, which is that there are
[02:09:56.140 --> 02:09:58.080]  bad actors in the developer ecosystem.
[02:09:58.080 --> 02:09:59.080]  Right.
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:02.920]  And the individual developer, you know, the, the base camp guys are not the bad actors.
[02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:03.920]  They've been good actors.
[02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:07.640]  So they're like, why am I being punished for this other guy being a jerk?
[02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:11.680]  And that's actually the kind of thing where like, I think this is such a powerful opportunity.
[02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:16.240]  Apple can set up incentives because they have a big enough platform where could a developer
[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:23.080]  earn the right to do payment off platform by proving over time or with affirmations
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:26.160]  in the app or some kind of app review status.
[02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:30.160]  Like this is the thing is like that idea of they're being dynamics is really powerful
[02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:33.680]  because then again, that thing of like, well, why does, you know, why does Amazon get a
[02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:34.680]  deal on iOS?
[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:35.680]  I don't.
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:36.680]  They're Amazon.
[02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:37.680]  Yeah.
[02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:38.680]  They're trillion dollar company.
[02:10:38.680 --> 02:10:39.680]  You're not, you're some kid in the garage.
[02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:40.680]  Right.
[02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:41.880]  So, so how do you get there?
[02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:42.880]  Right.
[02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:46.280]  And step one, can't be one, be a trillion dollar company, you know, step two, question
[02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:47.280]  mark, step three profit.
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:48.280]  Right.
[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:51.760]  So, so you just sort of document, here's a playing field that you can play on and understand
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:56.640]  the rules of, and not game, just, just understand you can earn user trust and do these things.
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:11:00.240]  And that's like that, that's what it bugs the shit out of me.
[02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:05.440]  It's what vexes me so much is they, they, they will understand the flaws in their system.
[02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:06.960]  They make a strong argument.
[02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:12.120]  We have to mediate overall the user experience because we are protecting users from bad actors
[02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:14.520]  who are hard to distinguish from you.
[02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:15.520]  Good actors.
[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:16.520]  Yeah.
[02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:17.520]  That's actually, it's not easy.
[02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:18.520]  It is not easy.
[02:11:18.520 --> 02:11:21.840]  And, and, and I think that's such a, that's like, that's not obvious because you don't
[02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:22.840]  see them.
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:23.840]  You don't see the bad actor.
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:24.840]  They're blocked.
[02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:25.840]  Yeah.
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:29.120]  And that's such an important idea.
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:33.320]  There's a bit of that on the Mac with the Mac app store where the Mac has these things
[02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:37.260]  that you can do outside the sandbox, you know, where you can't, it's not even conceptually
[02:11:37.260 --> 02:11:41.720]  possible on iOS and that certain apps in the Mac app store have entitlements to use the
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:46.720]  technical term, to do things like BB edit is in the Mac app store and can do things
[02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:52.120]  outside the file system that a default app from a kid in a garage can't do.
[02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:56.480]  You can, and then people say, well, wait, you said you treat all developers the same.
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:11:58.980]  Well, you can ask for the entitlement.
[02:11:58.980 --> 02:12:02.720]  So in a sense, I think that's Apple's, we're not lying.
[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:06.000]  Every developer can ask for the same entitlement, right?
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:07.280]  But they may not get it.
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:10.200]  And there's where some people will say, well, then they're not being treated the same.
[02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:14.880]  But if you have the track record that barebone software has of being trustworthy and being
[02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:15.880]  decades, right.
[02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:18.400]  And maybe, you know, you know, let's skip the decades part and say, you don't have to
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:23.760]  do it for 30 years, but you know, that, that, that maybe there could be entitlements for
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:28.640]  payment that you can earn and that, and then the argument for, you know, we treat everybody
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:31.600]  the same as everybody can earn it the same way.
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:32.600]  And so here's,
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:36.920]  I just want to say real quick, there's this idea of platform brokers mediating permissions
[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:38.880]  for the players on their platform.
[02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:42.920]  And it's really important because if you don't have some mediation there, you end up with
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:44.960]  the permissions overload, right?
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:48.400]  Like the old, I think it's windows Vista, like every time you did anything, it'd be
[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:49.400]  like, you moved your mouse.
[02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:51.000]  Do you want to confirm this by your admin password?
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:52.000]  Right.
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:53.000]  And we almost are trending towards that.
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.560]  Cause like every app wants location and alerts and dah, dah, dah.
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:59.680]  And I'm like, I don't want to have to hit, you know, allow 15 times when I install an
[02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:00.680]  app.
[02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:02.080]  So, so the platform has to mediate some permissions.
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:06.720]  And we see this with every kind of platform, like the social networks, they, YouTube is
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:10.200]  completely abdicated that they have any responsibility for the content on their platform.
[02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:13.520]  And it has been to the worst people have died as a result, right?
[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:18.480]  And so if they had taken some, there's this middle ground between complete wild west.
[02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:24.480]  And we're patronizing you all being by paternalistically locking down all the permissions.
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:28.920]  And that's the thing that Apple can document and navigate and like they are smart enough
[02:13:28.920 --> 02:13:30.480]  and they get it and they can also articulate.
[02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:32.960]  They are very good at articulating their arguments.
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:37.120]  This is good for users because you know, like whatever thoughts on flash, like all that
[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:42.160]  stuff is a very strong articulation of user benefit value that people can be like, I didn't
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:44.400]  get it at first, but I'll come along with you.
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:49.320]  And if they could do this on this where there's a third party payment entitlement and you
[02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:53.560]  could earn it through these trusted behaviors and you know, and it could be like, whatever,
[02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:56.920]  there's a payment escrow if we need to be able to refund or you commit to following
[02:13:56.920 --> 02:14:00.560]  a privacy policy where you're not gonna use people's data this way, whatever it is advocating
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:01.560]  for users.
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:03.040]  I think devs would sign up for it enthusiastically.
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:05.560]  They'd be like, I want to show I'm one of the good guys.
[02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:08.840]  I want the gold star of trusted to do payments.
[02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:09.960]  So to tie this off.
[02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:15.600]  So you have an Atari 2,600 or an old, uh, Sega Genesis or whatever the Nintendo system
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:19.000]  was that was so obscure that I don't remember, but you wanted to switch games.
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:20.000]  What'd you do?
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:25.240]  You took the cartridge out, you put the other cartridge in, now you have a new game, right?
[02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:30.020]  How do you delete an app on iOS and, and all of it, everything, all the files, everything
[02:14:30.020 --> 02:14:33.720]  it had, you just delete the app from your home screen, right?
[02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:34.720]  That's it.
[02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:35.720]  That's it.
[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:36.720]  You don't have to clean anything up.
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:37.720]  There's no cleaning up situation.
[02:14:37.720 --> 02:14:38.720]  There's nothing left behind.
[02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:40.480]  It's just, it's, it's neat.
[02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:41.520]  Here's the cool thing.
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:42.520]  So people don't know this.
[02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:45.000]  I don't think, cause I've mentioned this to a few people and they don't realize it.
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:50.760]  If you have an app with a subscription and you subscribe and then you're like, ah, I'm
[02:14:50.760 --> 02:14:51.760]  done with this app.
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:52.760]  I don't like it.
[02:14:52.760 --> 02:14:54.880]  And you delete the app and you say, do you want to delete this app?
[02:14:54.880 --> 02:14:56.540]  You delete the app on your iPhone.
[02:14:56.540 --> 02:15:00.960]  It then says, do you want to keep your subscription or cancel your subscription?
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:01.960]  Yeah.
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:02.960]  Yeah.
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:09.240]  And that is it, that your subscription is encapsulated in the app the same way your
[02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:12.100]  files are encapsulated in the app.
[02:15:12.100 --> 02:15:16.380]  Everything is encapsulated in the app and it's as neat conceptually as the cartridge
[02:15:16.380 --> 02:15:17.920]  in the old physical days.
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:22.580]  And again, it's a massive form of user advocacy and it's a very incredibly hard technical
[02:15:22.580 --> 02:15:26.780]  thing to pull off and it's seamless, but there's an, and it's a triumph, but you also would
[02:15:26.780 --> 02:15:27.780]  never notice.
[02:15:27.780 --> 02:15:28.780]  Right?
[02:15:28.780 --> 02:15:32.640]  So it's not one line of code, but there could be in theory and API for your, you know, payment
[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:33.640]  entitlement thing.
[02:15:33.640 --> 02:15:38.920]  You have to support this and we'll test it in review and you're, if the New York Times
[02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:43.560]  wants to take credit cards on their own in the app, they can do it, you know, through
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:44.560]  these terms.
[02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:48.460]  And then when you delete the New York Times app, it also will say, would you like to cancel
[02:15:48.460 --> 02:15:50.040]  your New York Times subscription?
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:54.260]  And you'll cancel it the same way, you know, but that encapsulation is part of the appeal
[02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:55.260]  of the iPhone.
[02:15:55.260 --> 02:16:01.820]  And you can't ignore that by saying, I wish that I could make a, an app that, that goes
[02:16:01.820 --> 02:16:05.820]  outside the app store without acknowledging that these things are useful from the user's
[02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:06.820]  perspective.
[02:16:06.820 --> 02:16:09.540]  And that's actually, I think that's sort of my fundamental frustration, which is there,
[02:16:09.540 --> 02:16:13.800]  there's, these are solvable problems and there's no way to have this conversation.
[02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:16.360]  And it's not, none of this is science fiction, right?
[02:16:16.360 --> 02:16:20.180]  Like we just distilled it down into, okay, payment entitlement, like we, we, we broke
[02:16:20.180 --> 02:16:21.180]  the problem down.
[02:16:21.180 --> 02:16:22.180]  Right.
[02:16:22.180 --> 02:16:25.800]  And Apple knows all this, they've had a decade plus to think about it.
[02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:27.060]  Somebody's floated this idea.
[02:16:27.060 --> 02:16:30.140]  There's an entire keynote internally about this somewhere.
[02:16:30.140 --> 02:16:31.140]  Right.
[02:16:31.140 --> 02:16:32.740]  And, and that's not visible.
[02:16:32.740 --> 02:16:36.340]  And that, that actually is the thing that really hurts developer trust because a million
[02:16:36.340 --> 02:16:38.020]  people could spit ball a better idea than this.
[02:16:38.020 --> 02:16:39.020]  Every person listens.
[02:16:39.020 --> 02:16:40.380]  I will, I can fix it by doing this.
[02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:41.380]  I have a better idea.
[02:16:41.380 --> 02:16:42.380]  Right.
[02:16:42.380 --> 02:16:43.380]  That's great.
[02:16:43.380 --> 02:16:46.900]  And, and that's the part that I think gets to the, the inequity that people push back
[02:16:46.900 --> 02:16:49.380]  against and gets to the, like, what harms trust.
[02:16:49.380 --> 02:16:50.380]  Right.
[02:16:50.380 --> 02:16:53.820]  Because they're like, well, we know like, like you're affirmatively choosing this ecosystem
[02:16:53.820 --> 02:16:56.540]  because you're frustrated by other ones.
[02:16:56.540 --> 02:16:57.540]  Yeah.
[02:16:57.540 --> 02:16:58.540]  Right.
[02:16:58.540 --> 02:17:03.020]  And that's something where, you know, I, you know, I spent all day long advocating to people
[02:17:03.020 --> 02:17:04.660]  why they should build stuff on the web.
[02:17:04.660 --> 02:17:05.660]  Right.
[02:17:05.660 --> 02:17:08.500]  And, and it's actually not that hard to sell when they think about it, but there's a generation
[02:17:08.500 --> 02:17:12.460]  of developers, you know, I'm trying to get them to look at Glitch and they're like, oh,
[02:17:12.460 --> 02:17:15.940]  but you know, you're not an app store and that's how people use apps.
[02:17:15.940 --> 02:17:19.220]  And I'm like, well, people used to use websites and they do every day, but they get to it
[02:17:19.220 --> 02:17:24.900]  through a link on one of those other apps, you know, and the, the hardest concept for
[02:17:24.900 --> 02:17:29.780]  them to understand is, especially for like young kids, students, they're like, well,
[02:17:29.780 --> 02:17:34.780]  I made the, you know, my little app on the web and then who do I send it to?
[02:17:34.780 --> 02:17:37.540]  You know, I'm like, no, you don't have to ask anybody for approval.
[02:17:37.540 --> 02:17:39.380]  You don't have to, you know what I mean?
[02:17:39.380 --> 02:17:44.500]  And the most mind blowing thing by far, most mind blowing thing for them is view source.
[02:17:44.500 --> 02:17:45.500]  Right.
[02:17:45.500 --> 02:17:48.540]  When you tell them you can view source on a website and you can see it all and you can
[02:17:48.540 --> 02:17:54.060]  copy and paste it, you know, work on your, your webpage, it, they're like, did I hack
[02:17:54.060 --> 02:17:55.060]  this?
[02:17:55.060 --> 02:17:56.140]  Like, am I allowed?
[02:17:56.140 --> 02:18:01.020]  Is this, you know, like there, and what I realize is because they've come up in locked
[02:18:01.020 --> 02:18:05.020]  down ecosystems on platforms that were not general purpose computing devices.
[02:18:05.020 --> 02:18:08.860]  What was the starting point for a generation of us that learned coding on computers where
[02:18:08.860 --> 02:18:12.500]  that was all you could do is now seen as transgressive.
[02:18:12.500 --> 02:18:13.500]  Right.
[02:18:13.500 --> 02:18:14.780]  And that is a loss.
[02:18:14.780 --> 02:18:19.580]  That is a thing that I actually think Apple, you know, Swift playgrounds is fine, but it's
[02:18:19.580 --> 02:18:20.580]  called playgrounds.
[02:18:20.580 --> 02:18:21.580]  Right.
[02:18:21.580 --> 02:18:22.580]  It's intrinsically infantilizing.
[02:18:22.580 --> 02:18:23.580]  Right.
[02:18:23.580 --> 02:18:26.500]  And, and Xcode is like, it's a lifestyle commitment.
[02:18:26.500 --> 02:18:31.020]  Like you're doing a whole, there's a big leap there and, and, and, and there's actually
[02:18:31.020 --> 02:18:35.180]  this middle ground, which could be like, if I make an app and I just want to share with
[02:18:35.180 --> 02:18:37.180]  my friends, I don't want in the app store.
[02:18:37.180 --> 02:18:38.180]  Right.
[02:18:38.180 --> 02:18:44.140]  Um, what, what would I do if I just want to try stuff that generativity of what, you know,
[02:18:44.140 --> 02:18:47.340]  my kid is on scratch all day and it's incredible, incredible platform.
[02:18:47.340 --> 02:18:48.340]  I mean, just unbelievable.
[02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:50.500]  And there's lots of different things like that.
[02:18:50.500 --> 02:18:55.020]  I think that's the thing that like was the spirit that inspired these platforms and then
[02:18:55.020 --> 02:19:00.500]  inspired the people to join them and is what is the emotional catalyst for why developers
[02:19:00.500 --> 02:19:01.500]  chafe at the limits.
[02:19:01.500 --> 02:19:06.260]  It is not abstract ideas about general purpose computing platforms, although I think they
[02:19:06.260 --> 02:19:07.460]  can articulate it that way.
[02:19:07.460 --> 02:19:11.620]  I think it is the thing that captured my spirit and that spoke to me like the first time I
[02:19:11.620 --> 02:19:14.820]  picked up a guitar or a keyboard and I could express myself the first time I picked up
[02:19:14.820 --> 02:19:20.020]  a paintbrush or a pencil when I picked up a computer and I could really create with
[02:19:20.020 --> 02:19:22.780]  it, not toy create, not baby web.
[02:19:22.780 --> 02:19:23.780]  Right.
[02:19:23.780 --> 02:19:29.020]  Like, like, like job said in your little baby internet, like not baby web, but real, real
[02:19:29.020 --> 02:19:30.020]  things.
[02:19:30.020 --> 02:19:31.940]  Doesn't that explain you're empowering me.
[02:19:31.940 --> 02:19:35.620]  Doesn't that explain the persistent popularity of Minecraft too, right?
[02:19:35.620 --> 02:19:36.620]  Oh yeah.
[02:19:36.620 --> 02:19:37.620]  Very much so.
[02:19:37.620 --> 02:19:38.620]  Yeah.
[02:19:38.620 --> 02:19:39.620]  Minecraft is in that space.
[02:19:39.620 --> 02:19:40.620]  Roblox is in that space.
[02:19:40.620 --> 02:19:41.620]  Right.
[02:19:41.620 --> 02:19:42.620]  I mean, those are the, those are the models I look at when we built glitch, which is like,
[02:19:42.620 --> 02:19:46.060]  I don't look at like, like we plug into visual studio code and that's great.
[02:19:46.060 --> 02:19:47.060]  Then you can write code there.
[02:19:47.060 --> 02:19:52.100]  But like, I am not trying to clone an integrated development environment made by a trillion
[02:19:52.100 --> 02:19:53.100]  dollar company.
[02:19:53.100 --> 02:19:57.420]  I am like, where are people going in generatively building stuff that makes their heart sing?
[02:19:57.420 --> 02:19:58.420]  Right.
[02:19:58.420 --> 02:19:59.620]  So I, I, we had to tie it off.
[02:19:59.620 --> 02:20:03.340]  I know I've gone along, but let me tie this off with this thought.
[02:20:03.340 --> 02:20:09.940]  And it's the flip side of, of Francisco Komowski's thing that you can't build the net, you know,
[02:20:09.940 --> 02:20:14.180]  the mosaic of 90 for today on iOS.
[02:20:14.180 --> 02:20:17.500]  But the flip side of it is you can't make it on iOS either.
[02:20:17.500 --> 02:20:18.500]  Right.
[02:20:18.500 --> 02:20:19.500]  That's what we're talking about.
[02:20:19.500 --> 02:20:20.500]  Right.
[02:20:20.500 --> 02:20:22.620]  You can't make it on iOS.
[02:20:22.620 --> 02:20:28.400]  Like it's whether it should, there should be an option to turn your phone into that
[02:20:28.400 --> 02:20:29.460]  sort of platform.
[02:20:29.460 --> 02:20:33.940]  If you're a developer that this is my spitball idea, my loose, and I don't even want to get
[02:20:33.940 --> 02:20:34.940]  into defining it.
[02:20:34.940 --> 02:20:35.940]  I'll just call it.
[02:20:35.940 --> 02:20:39.460]  The name isn't sideloading it.
[02:20:39.460 --> 02:20:41.500]  It's developer mode developer mode.
[02:20:41.500 --> 02:20:47.020]  There should be a developer mode for iOS and just the name alone should scare people.
[02:20:47.020 --> 02:20:48.020]  Your web browser.
[02:20:48.020 --> 02:20:49.020]  Yeah.
[02:20:49.020 --> 02:20:53.260]  Your web browser has developer tools and they're incredible and they're built in and they're
[02:20:53.260 --> 02:20:54.260]  free.
[02:20:54.260 --> 02:20:57.140]  But that to me is the part that it's sort of missing from.
[02:20:57.140 --> 02:21:00.940]  And I'm sure Francisco Tomasky, who I know offline a bit, I'm sure he'd agree.
[02:21:00.940 --> 02:21:02.380]  I'm sure he'd say, yeah, you're right.
[02:21:02.380 --> 02:21:03.380]  That does suck.
[02:21:03.380 --> 02:21:04.380]  It sucks.
[02:21:04.380 --> 02:21:08.420]  You should be able to use the phone and the iPad to make the thing for the phone and iPad
[02:21:08.420 --> 02:21:10.120]  that doesn't fit within the rules.
[02:21:10.120 --> 02:21:12.020]  But it's both sides of it.
[02:21:12.020 --> 02:21:16.500]  And that's the thing is that all of the older computers and what I mean by general purpose
[02:21:16.500 --> 02:21:19.980]  computer and I know that it's what you mean is it's both.
[02:21:19.980 --> 02:21:25.380]  It's that you can add things to it that weren't imagined before and you created them on the
[02:21:25.380 --> 02:21:26.420]  thing itself.
[02:21:26.420 --> 02:21:27.660]  And that's the magic.
[02:21:27.660 --> 02:21:33.020]  That's the thing that is like, why am I still into these things and why I, you know, it's
[02:21:33.020 --> 02:21:38.220]  that you use the thing to make the thing or just to break it apart and go.
[02:21:38.220 --> 02:21:43.420]  That thrill, that joy of getting it to light up and do the thing that you had in your head
[02:21:43.420 --> 02:21:48.020]  and realizing this tool can make whatever I can imagine is what makes these things special
[02:21:48.020 --> 02:21:52.420]  and why people chafe at any limits that feel like they're a barrier between that.
[02:21:52.420 --> 02:21:57.620]  And it is also the spark that inspired these companies to exist in the first place.
[02:21:57.620 --> 02:22:01.260]  And they should just honor that thing that brought them in in the first place.
[02:22:01.260 --> 02:22:04.580]  And I think that's such a vital, it's so doable.
[02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:06.140]  It's so close.
[02:22:06.140 --> 02:22:07.140]  Thank you.
[02:22:07.140 --> 02:22:08.140]  It's so good to have you here.
[02:22:08.140 --> 02:22:09.140]  Okay.
[02:22:09.140 --> 02:22:10.340]  Let's do some point people.
[02:22:10.340 --> 02:22:16.580]  So your, your personal site, anildash.com, whatever happened to dashes.com.
[02:22:16.580 --> 02:22:22.440]  You know, after a while, I was like, I want to put my name on it, but it's the same blog.
[02:22:22.440 --> 02:22:29.620]  And your company glitch glitch, glitch.com where people should check this out and really
[02:22:29.620 --> 02:22:30.980]  very cool stuff.
[02:22:30.980 --> 02:22:33.420]  Really, really, really innovative.
[02:22:33.420 --> 02:22:35.900]  And you could do whatever you want because it's all on the web.
[02:22:35.900 --> 02:22:36.900]  Yeah.
[02:22:36.900 --> 02:22:37.900]  Yeah.
[02:22:37.900 --> 02:22:42.620]  And so if you want the biggest surprise was not just web apps, but you can, you can hook
[02:22:42.620 --> 02:22:44.780]  up to your iOS shortcuts.
[02:22:44.780 --> 02:22:47.580]  And so you, if you want like a little bit of a, like, you need a little bit of logic
[02:22:47.580 --> 02:22:50.340]  on the web to do something that you want your shortcut to do, and you want to pull some
[02:22:50.340 --> 02:22:52.660]  data down or do whatever you can do that.
[02:22:52.660 --> 02:22:56.300]  So I think that's such an interesting space, but yeah, anybody who's a dev, I think it's
[02:22:56.300 --> 02:22:59.220]  like, it's great that people are building, you know, a Slack bot or something for work
[02:22:59.220 --> 02:23:03.100]  or a dashboard, but I just that the idea of a creative space to share something you want
[02:23:03.100 --> 02:23:07.620]  to make with the world on the web shortcuts is sort of, and again, we can't go into it,
[02:23:07.620 --> 02:23:13.860]  but shortcuts is sort of the, the pinhole through the thing that you can see the possibility
[02:23:13.860 --> 02:23:18.620]  through and it, and it's both to see the possibility and you find out that you can like, Oh, now
[02:23:18.620 --> 02:23:22.700]  you can pop through and you can actually run like a web service in your custom thing.
[02:23:22.700 --> 02:23:27.140]  And so you can do a thing that had no imagination within, you know, you were hiding from me
[02:23:27.140 --> 02:23:28.140]  the whole time.
[02:23:28.140 --> 02:23:29.140]  Right.
[02:23:29.140 --> 02:23:33.580]  It's like, Ooh, it is, you know, it is like a little peephole that you can see through
[02:23:33.580 --> 02:23:34.580]  it.
[02:23:34.580 --> 02:23:38.260]  And the fact that it even exists in Apple clearly knows it exists and it's not off in
[02:23:38.260 --> 02:23:39.260]  a corner.
[02:23:39.260 --> 02:23:40.580]  It's actually gets keynote time.
[02:23:40.580 --> 02:23:44.740]  It lets you think that maybe somewhere within app, you know, that they absolutely are aware
[02:23:44.740 --> 02:23:45.740]  of this.
[02:23:45.740 --> 02:23:48.020]  And why don't you tell us, tell us your story about it.
[02:23:48.020 --> 02:23:49.020]  Please tell us.
[02:23:49.020 --> 02:23:50.020]  Yeah.
[02:23:50.020 --> 02:23:51.020]  Right.
[02:23:51.020 --> 02:23:52.020]  Yeah.
[02:23:52.020 --> 02:23:53.020]  Yeah.
[02:23:53.020 --> 02:23:54.020]  It's so, it just, it's so tantalizing.
[02:23:54.020 --> 02:23:55.020]  I know.
[02:23:55.020 --> 02:23:56.020]  So glad to have you.
[02:23:56.020 --> 02:23:57.020]  Thank you for your time.
[02:23:57.020 --> 02:24:07.980]  Uh, be well.
