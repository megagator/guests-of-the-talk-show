[00:00.000 --> 00:02.760]  Saving your pennies for a $10,000 Apple watch.
[00:02.760 --> 00:15.000]  I am going bottom of the line because you refurbished, please call them refurbished.
[00:15.000 --> 00:17.900]  If I could get one refurbished, it probably would.
[00:17.900 --> 00:25.620]  My philosophy is that particularly with the, with the early ones, just to be, um, price
[00:25.620 --> 00:31.880]  conscious because, you know, I'm not, you know, I am not completely sold on the benefits
[00:31.880 --> 00:32.880]  of it yet.
[00:32.880 --> 00:38.520]  And I don't want to dump and, and I think that the next, you know, the ramp up is going
[00:38.520 --> 00:43.520]  to get is steeper in the beginning.
[00:43.520 --> 00:46.320]  I'm fascinated by it, because I think it's so much fun.
[00:46.320 --> 00:51.300]  I think it's a, it's, it's a very fun time to be in our racket of talking about Apple
[00:51.300 --> 00:55.080]  and writing about Apple, because nobody has any idea what the hell is going on.
[00:55.080 --> 00:56.080]  I love it.
[00:56.080 --> 00:57.080]  I really do.
[00:57.080 --> 00:58.080]  I love that.
[00:58.080 --> 00:59.080]  We're all just lost.
[00:59.080 --> 01:00.540]  And I'm not pretending that I'm not lost.
[01:00.540 --> 01:02.480]  I'm completely lost.
[01:02.480 --> 01:03.480]  I don't know.
[01:03.480 --> 01:04.480]  Like,
[01:04.480 --> 01:09.320]  why are you told in your, your last because why, because, well, because I'm not sure of
[01:09.320 --> 01:11.400]  what it does yet or exactly.
[01:11.400 --> 01:17.000]  I'm at it in terms of like pricing aside, like, let's just assume I'm just getting the
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.140]  aluminum base model because I'm a skeptic.
[01:21.140 --> 01:24.000]  And you know, and I feel like if I love it, maybe I'll get a more expensive one next year
[01:24.000 --> 01:25.280]  or whatever.
[01:25.280 --> 01:27.100]  I still have no idea why I would want to wear it.
[01:27.100 --> 01:28.100]  I really don't.
[01:28.100 --> 01:30.160]  You know, I wear a watch for time.
[01:30.160 --> 01:31.600]  You do wear a watch though.
[01:31.600 --> 01:32.600]  Yes.
[01:32.600 --> 01:33.600]  Yes.
[01:33.600 --> 01:34.600]  Yeah.
[01:34.600 --> 01:39.940]  I have, I've wore a watch forever and the battery died on mine like right before Christmas.
[01:39.940 --> 01:40.940]  And I was like, well, screwed.
[01:40.940 --> 01:43.600]  I'm not going to spend 15 bucks on a battery.
[01:43.600 --> 01:46.440]  I'm going to wait until April.
[01:46.440 --> 01:52.480]  So I have not been wearing one since slightly before Christmas.
[01:52.480 --> 01:53.480]  Does it drive you nuts?
[01:53.480 --> 01:54.480]  Not really.
[01:54.480 --> 01:55.480]  Did you get used to it?
[01:55.480 --> 01:56.480]  I'm still, I still would rather.
[01:56.480 --> 01:59.280]  I like to just look at my hand for the time.
[01:59.280 --> 02:04.600]  I've worn a watch since I was, I don't know, 15, 14, 15, sometime in like middle school.
[02:04.600 --> 02:05.600]  Yeah.
[02:05.600 --> 02:07.400]  Did you ever have a pocket watch?
[02:07.400 --> 02:08.400]  No.
[02:08.400 --> 02:10.720]  My grandfather did.
[02:10.720 --> 02:12.400]  My grandmother had given me a pocket watch.
[02:12.400 --> 02:13.400]  So I care.
[02:13.400 --> 02:17.480]  So for a while I had a pocket watch.
[02:17.480 --> 02:19.520]  Embarrassing facts about me.
[02:19.520 --> 02:21.520]  They were very cool though.
[02:21.520 --> 02:22.520]  I don't know.
[02:22.520 --> 02:25.880]  That's the way I did it.
[02:25.880 --> 02:32.700]  I think Kottke had a piece a couple of years ago about how the, and I totally understand
[02:32.700 --> 02:36.480]  like all the people out there, I'm sure that probably 70% of the people listening right
[02:36.480 --> 02:40.760]  now are all thinking the same thing, which is I don't wear a watch because my phone's
[02:40.760 --> 02:46.200]  with me all the time and I can take it out and get the time from the phone, which is
[02:46.200 --> 02:47.440]  totally valid.
[02:47.440 --> 02:51.900]  It's just, and maybe if I was a kid today, that's what I would do that I'd never develop.
[02:51.900 --> 02:56.420]  It's just that I have the habit I've had, you know, 20, 20 some years of wearing a watch
[02:56.420 --> 02:57.420]  every day.
[02:57.420 --> 02:58.420]  I mean, it's a hard habit to break.
[02:58.420 --> 03:02.880]  Kottke had a piece, I think, I think it was Kottke a couple of years ago where he just,
[03:02.880 --> 03:07.280]  you know, pointed out that using your smartphone as your watch is pretty much the exact same
[03:07.280 --> 03:11.920]  mechanism as, you know, our grandfather's with their pocket watches.
[03:11.920 --> 03:12.920]  It's in your pocket.
[03:12.920 --> 03:18.000]  You take it out, you hit a flip a thing and you got the time and you put it back.
[03:18.000 --> 03:20.640]  And I'm not, you know, it works.
[03:20.640 --> 03:26.640]  I just, I, I feel like it's a distraction with my kid around.
[03:26.640 --> 03:32.480]  Like the minute I get my phone out, it becomes like a, I go, Oh, let's, you know, what's
[03:32.480 --> 03:34.880]  going on on dad's phone.
[03:34.880 --> 03:40.280]  What's, what games does dad have and what can I, can I play with dad's phone?
[03:40.280 --> 03:44.760]  And so, uh, it seems like a watch is a little easier, although I'm not sure like a smartwatch
[03:44.760 --> 03:45.760]  is going to be much better.
[03:45.760 --> 03:50.760]  I think that'll be a whole different series of distractions.
[03:50.760 --> 03:53.600]  Yeah, I, I don't know.
[03:53.600 --> 03:59.600]  It's I never was impressed with the notifications using the pebble, but you know, maybe the
[03:59.600 --> 04:02.160]  fact that you can interact with them here will make a difference.
[04:02.160 --> 04:07.640]  I don't know that you could, in a pinch, you can dictate, you know, a reply using Siri.
[04:07.640 --> 04:08.640]  I'm still unsure.
[04:08.640 --> 04:09.640]  Anyway, the two.
[04:09.640 --> 04:11.460]  So there's two reasons that I feel like I'm totally lost.
[04:11.460 --> 04:16.260]  I still don't quite get what it is that I would like about this.
[04:16.260 --> 04:18.480]  And number two is this whole addition model.
[04:18.480 --> 04:22.360]  I, I, I totally think it's going to cost thousands of dollars.
[04:22.360 --> 04:28.080]  I totally don't understand how they'll sell a thing for thousands of dollars that presumably
[04:28.080 --> 04:33.560]  is going to be, you know, outdated in three years, technically.
[04:33.560 --> 04:34.560]  I don't get it.
[04:34.560 --> 04:36.360]  Like I totally think they're going to do it totally.
[04:36.360 --> 04:39.480]  Don't get how that process is going to work.
[04:39.480 --> 04:40.480]  Yeah.
[04:40.480 --> 04:44.160]  So your, your view of the price points remind me your view of the price points.
[04:44.160 --> 04:51.060]  So we know that we know the, the aluminum one, three 50, you think the stainless one
[04:51.060 --> 04:53.640]  is going to be a thousand.
[04:53.640 --> 04:54.640]  Is that right?
[04:54.640 --> 04:55.640]  Oh yeah.
[04:55.640 --> 04:56.640]  That's my ballpark.
[04:56.640 --> 04:57.640]  And I've been thinking about it.
[04:57.640 --> 05:03.920]  I think, but I think it could be something like, like that it averages to a thousand
[05:03.920 --> 05:08.820]  because like, let's say like if you get the stainless with a, with something other than
[05:08.820 --> 05:16.080]  the metallic band, maybe it's like $700 or six, six 49, you know, 650 bucks for the stainless
[05:16.080 --> 05:17.080]  to start.
[05:17.080 --> 05:24.320]  But if you get the one with the metal band or that mesh metal band, maybe it's like $1,100.
[05:24.320 --> 05:27.360]  And I know that there's a lot of people who know nothing about watches are like, well,
[05:27.360 --> 05:29.920]  why in the world would the metal band make it cost $500 more dollars?
[05:29.920 --> 05:34.040]  But if you look at the way watches are priced, that's, that's actually pretty typical.
[05:34.040 --> 05:40.200]  Like the metal bands on a premium watch are crazy expensive.
[05:40.200 --> 05:44.980]  Some people I've talked to seem to think that the stainless one will be like 500 bucks,
[05:44.980 --> 05:47.600]  but I don't think so either.
[05:47.600 --> 05:52.680]  That doesn't seem like that's, I only think that works if you're trying to upsell.
[05:52.680 --> 05:54.400]  And I don't think at this point they will be.
[05:54.400 --> 05:55.400]  Yeah.
[05:55.400 --> 05:59.040]  I think that they, you know, they, and it brings up another point with something that
[05:59.040 --> 06:03.440]  almost I haven't seen anybody talk about is, are there going to be storage tiers?
[06:03.440 --> 06:08.080]  Is there going to be like an eight, 16, 32 gigabyte split?
[06:08.080 --> 06:14.480]  I don't think so unless it corresponds to the materials.
[06:14.480 --> 06:23.120]  Like if sport is eight gigabytes and stainless is 16 and addition is 32, but I don't, I can't
[06:23.120 --> 06:30.240]  see how they would do aluminum at eight, 16, 32 and keep adding 50 bucks or a hundred bucks
[06:30.240 --> 06:31.440]  or something like that.
[06:31.440 --> 06:32.440]  Yeah.
[06:32.440 --> 06:33.440]  It seems too confusing at that point.
[06:33.440 --> 06:36.320]  It seems too way too confusing because you've got all these, you know, it seems like all
[06:36.320 --> 06:40.680]  of the choice you have to make is about what colors you want and what bands you want.
[06:40.680 --> 06:46.520]  And then if you multiply that by two or three with storage tiers, it's, you know, it's insane
[06:46.520 --> 06:47.520]  to start with though.
[06:47.520 --> 06:52.640]  The apps are basically almost like shells for things that are going on on the phone,
[06:52.640 --> 06:53.640]  right?
[06:53.640 --> 06:55.840]  The apps that you'll add anyway.
[06:55.840 --> 06:56.840]  Yeah.
[06:56.840 --> 06:59.840]  The only thing that I could think you'd need storage for right now, the third party, I
[06:59.840 --> 07:03.000]  mean, but they said though, they've already announced that there will be a full quote,
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.360]  full SDK later in the year.
[07:05.360 --> 07:09.200]  So there will be some space that you'll need for apps.
[07:09.200 --> 07:13.540]  But it's so, so even though off right off the start with the initial SDK, they're kind
[07:13.540 --> 07:20.380]  of thin, thin apps that just communicate over the air to your iPhone apps.
[07:20.380 --> 07:24.480]  Let's presume that later in the year means that, you know, obviously this year, so you're
[07:24.480 --> 07:27.760]  going to need to put apps on the thing.
[07:27.760 --> 07:33.180]  It has the photos app, but I would guess, right, that it's going to be there, you know,
[07:33.180 --> 07:37.240]  if it's only one and a half inches big, they can shrink the photos before they sync them
[07:37.240 --> 07:39.040]  over to your watch.
[07:39.040 --> 07:44.600]  Like I don't, I don't think, yeah, I don't think that you're going to need a lot of storage
[07:44.600 --> 07:46.200]  for your photos.
[07:46.200 --> 07:50.400]  And what else is there?
[07:50.400 --> 07:52.400]  I guess music, right?
[07:52.400 --> 07:53.400]  Yeah.
[07:53.400 --> 07:54.400]  Right.
[07:54.400 --> 07:55.400]  So it's just audio.
[07:55.400 --> 07:58.240]  So, you know, I don't think you need a lot of storage.
[07:58.240 --> 08:04.160]  It would be still be nicer if it was 16 instead of eight, but I don't know, but nobody's really
[08:04.160 --> 08:05.160]  talking about that.
[08:05.160 --> 08:06.160]  No.
[08:06.160 --> 08:07.160]  I know.
[08:07.160 --> 08:08.160]  Yeah.
[08:08.160 --> 08:14.680]  I lived with a four gigabyte iPhone for two years and, you know, it was pretty tight at
[08:14.680 --> 08:18.480]  the end, but back then it worked.
[08:18.480 --> 08:22.560]  So yeah, especially if you didn't need a lot of music.
[08:22.560 --> 08:24.560]  My tastes are simple.
[08:24.560 --> 08:26.280]  Yeah.
[08:26.280 --> 08:31.680]  Right now it's movies, it's video and all the mega AAA iPhone games.
[08:31.680 --> 08:37.520]  Oh, so the other thing that I wonder about is if there's a, I was leaning towards getting
[08:37.520 --> 08:41.680]  the smaller one cause I don't have a very big wrist and I've traditionally gotten like
[08:41.680 --> 08:42.680]  men's watches.
[08:42.680 --> 08:45.320]  You can often get in like a smaller size.
[08:45.320 --> 08:48.900]  I don't buy ladies watches, but you can get a men's watch in a smaller size.
[08:48.900 --> 08:52.160]  And I was, so I was leaning towards the smaller one, but the only thing that makes me wonder
[08:52.160 --> 08:56.640]  is, is if there's going to be a big difference in battery life between the two.
[08:56.640 --> 08:57.640]  Yeah.
[08:57.640 --> 09:00.040]  And I, whether there'll be a price difference too.
[09:00.040 --> 09:01.040]  I mean, I've been priced.
[09:01.040 --> 09:04.360]  I was assuming there would not be, but that's possible.
[09:04.360 --> 09:06.920]  Yeah, I don't know.
[09:06.920 --> 09:11.360]  And I guess in the addition model, there almost certainly would be, because even though you're
[09:11.360 --> 09:16.240]  not really paying for the gold, you know, like the, the gold is just a fraction of the
[09:16.240 --> 09:17.240]  price.
[09:17.240 --> 09:22.140]  I think it's still, I feel like once you're into premium materials, you kind of have to
[09:22.140 --> 09:24.800]  decide, you know, you have to pay by the price.
[09:24.800 --> 09:25.800]  Right.
[09:25.800 --> 09:31.800]  And the other thing is I I've always, I mean, it just, the smart watches still are huge
[09:31.800 --> 09:32.800]  by and large.
[09:32.800 --> 09:37.040]  I mean, the ones that are out right now are gigantic and it's the ones that, you know,
[09:37.040 --> 09:42.560]  the Android wear ones are very large and the large one is not too much smaller than most
[09:42.560 --> 09:43.560]  of those.
[09:43.560 --> 09:47.200]  Whereas the small one is fairly significantly smaller than those.
[09:47.200 --> 09:53.680]  And I had a Motorola 360 on my wrist one time and it was, it was way too big.
[09:53.680 --> 09:56.520]  Uh, yeah, it's definitely pretty big.
[09:56.520 --> 10:02.920]  I, although you have to, you know, I, the first one I saw in real life was, uh, uh,
[10:02.920 --> 10:10.440]  I ran into Andy and Natko at the airport on the way out to the, uh, uh, the iPhone Apple
[10:10.440 --> 10:11.440]  watch event.
[10:11.440 --> 10:12.440]  Actually.
[10:12.440 --> 10:13.640]  He, he was flying through Philly.
[10:13.640 --> 10:17.240]  He'd like Boston, the Philly, the SFO, and we were on the same flight.
[10:17.240 --> 10:22.920]  Um, and it was like, this is weird that look, that guy looks just like Andy and it was like,
[10:22.920 --> 10:29.000]  Oh my God, it is in, uh, so he, you know, he's, you know, it's, it's, it's just serious
[10:29.000 --> 10:30.000]  sized man.
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.120]  Uh, it looked okay on his wrist.
[10:32.120 --> 10:33.760]  Totally looked okay on his wrist.
[10:33.760 --> 10:35.240]  It looked goofy on me.
[10:35.240 --> 10:36.240]  Yeah.
[10:36.240 --> 10:37.240]  It doesn't look good on me at all.
[10:37.240 --> 10:38.740]  No, it's pretty big.
[10:38.740 --> 10:41.360]  Not much looks good on me, but that definitely did not look good on me.
[10:41.360 --> 10:42.360]  Yeah.
[10:42.360 --> 10:43.360]  It's not a huge, it's not goofy.
[10:43.360 --> 10:46.640]  It's just, it's big though.
[10:46.640 --> 10:48.520]  It was pretty goofy on me.
[10:48.520 --> 10:49.520]  Yeah.
[10:49.520 --> 10:53.520]  Well, it's funny because you know that a millimeter is very small, right?
[10:53.520 --> 10:57.960]  A 10th of a centimeter is, you know, one millimeter is pretty, you know, give or take.
[10:57.960 --> 11:02.200]  Um, and so you see all the, you know, watches are always sized in millimeters and it's,
[11:02.200 --> 11:06.200]  you know, you see that this one's 39 and this one's 42 and you think, wow, that's probably
[11:06.200 --> 11:08.160]  about the same size, but like, it's not true.
[11:08.160 --> 11:12.840]  Like a 39 is sort of like a traditional men's wristwatch size by today's standards, a little
[11:12.840 --> 11:17.560]  small and 42 is actually kind of a big watch, but like the really big ones, like people
[11:17.560 --> 11:19.680]  are selling like 46 millimeter watches.
[11:19.680 --> 11:20.680]  Yeah.
[11:20.680 --> 11:21.680]  Yeah.
[11:21.680 --> 11:25.200]  No, I think part of the problem with the Motorola 360 is just that it's a, it's a cylinder.
[11:25.200 --> 11:28.880]  Um, it doesn't, the edges aren't graduated at all.
[11:28.880 --> 11:34.320]  And so it, it just sits right up on top of your wrist all the way around.
[11:34.320 --> 11:35.680]  Yeah.
[11:35.680 --> 11:40.560]  So it's not so much, it's not necessarily the diameter as it is that does design or
[11:40.560 --> 11:42.560]  lack thereof.
[11:42.560 --> 11:43.680]  Yeah.
[11:43.680 --> 11:50.740]  No, I think it's, they've totally, and I know that looking at them on the web, it's, it's,
[11:50.740 --> 11:55.320]  you can't tell that it's so much smaller than the competing smartwatches, but once they're
[11:55.320 --> 11:58.440]  out in the real world and people can compare them side by side, I think the difference
[11:58.440 --> 12:00.000]  is pretty striking.
[12:00.000 --> 12:01.440]  And who knows what that means for battery life?
[12:01.440 --> 12:06.080]  I mean, clearly it has some kind of, you know, some kind of hit on battery life because the,
[12:06.080 --> 12:09.920]  you know, bigger is bigger, bigger watch has a bigger battery.
[12:09.920 --> 12:13.360]  And famously, everybody is saying, everybody who knows anything about the, you know, the
[12:13.360 --> 12:16.600]  rumors of the watch, you know, everybody's saying the same thing that, you know, battery
[12:16.600 --> 12:21.840]  life is a huge concern and they're obviously very cagey about it in their, what they've
[12:21.840 --> 12:24.880]  said publicly.
[12:24.880 --> 12:30.320]  Do you think that the, that them getting all these people from Tesla is related to just
[12:30.320 --> 12:39.520]  battery in general or, or I don't know enough saving up for your car.
[12:39.520 --> 12:42.520]  I don't know.
[12:42.520 --> 12:48.000]  I don't know enough about battery technology, even though I should, because in sixth grade,
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.480]  my science fair project was about batteries.
[12:52.480 --> 12:53.480]  Since then though, I've fallen.
[12:53.480 --> 12:54.480]  You should dig it up.
[12:54.480 --> 12:56.200]  You should go back and.
[12:56.200 --> 12:59.840]  I have fallen way behind on my understanding.
[12:59.840 --> 13:06.600]  Like I have no idea whether somebody who is an expert in this sort of big battery that
[13:06.600 --> 13:14.120]  you would need to move a sedan for 300 miles would have any kind of expertise that would
[13:14.120 --> 13:20.480]  be applicable to the sort of battery you want in a, you know, seven millimeter thick phone.
[13:20.480 --> 13:24.960]  It strikes me as kind of like a Jobsian thing to do to hire somebody who makes, who makes
[13:24.960 --> 13:30.160]  a trunk sized battery and tell them, okay, now just put that in a watch.
[13:30.160 --> 13:35.400]  I would, I'm thinking probably it is probably, you know, somebody who's an expert on one
[13:35.400 --> 13:39.120]  can, can quickly get up to speed on the other.
[13:39.120 --> 13:42.800]  It might be, it's as likely as anything, you know, who knows?
[13:42.800 --> 13:54.520]  I think that there's such a crazy boom or, or, or, you know, it's a, it's a seller's
[13:54.520 --> 13:55.980]  market in Silicon Valley.
[13:55.980 --> 14:01.880]  If you're a talented engineer of any sort, it seems, you know, so I think you know, who
[14:01.880 --> 14:02.880]  knows?
[14:02.880 --> 14:03.880]  It may not even be that specific.
[14:03.880 --> 14:07.720]  It might just be, you know, there's a bunch of smart guys at Tesla that try to steal them.
[14:07.720 --> 14:11.480]  We need, we need more smart people.
[14:11.480 --> 14:12.480]  I don't know.
[14:12.480 --> 14:18.320]  But the, you know, I guess that the, you know, that's the other thing that broke at least
[14:18.320 --> 14:23.320]  since last I had a technical talk show is that the, the journal, I guess the wall street
[14:23.320 --> 14:27.240]  journal was it who more or less said flatly that Apple has what, over a hundred people
[14:27.240 --> 14:28.240]  working on a car.
[14:28.240 --> 14:32.360]  It seems like a lot of people for it's, you know, still secret project.
[14:32.360 --> 14:36.240]  Yeah, I guess.
[14:36.240 --> 14:37.240]  I don't know.
[14:37.240 --> 14:40.380]  I have no idea how many people it takes to make a car.
[14:40.380 --> 14:44.520]  It makes even less sense to me than, not that I would, not that they wouldn't, you know,
[14:44.520 --> 14:51.280]  like I think that the basic gist of in broad, this is why the rumor I think catches people's
[14:51.280 --> 14:58.460]  imagination because in a broad sense, it feels basically like it could be true because cars
[14:58.460 --> 15:02.760]  are a market where a, there's a lot of them, so there's a lot of money to be made.
[15:02.760 --> 15:07.980]  B it's a market where design matters and has always mattered.
[15:07.980 --> 15:10.360]  Everybody accepts that design matters in cars, right?
[15:10.360 --> 15:15.240]  There's not, it's not like with the computers where people, you know, for years would say,
[15:15.240 --> 15:19.740]  you know, Apple just wastes money on design.
[15:19.740 --> 15:23.240]  Everybody just yet, you know, same people who would say that would, you know, we'll
[15:23.240 --> 15:27.840]  spend, you know, three days picking out their new car because they care about it.
[15:27.840 --> 15:35.640]  So design matters and three, it feels like it's, you know, technology is about to revolutionize
[15:35.640 --> 15:36.640]  the industry.
[15:36.640 --> 15:42.160]  You know, people are talking, clearly there's the switch in energy from gas to electric
[15:42.160 --> 15:46.320]  and there's the whole self driving angle.
[15:46.320 --> 15:47.560]  Yeah.
[15:47.560 --> 15:52.800]  As well as the, just the interface interfaces that you interact with inside the car.
[15:52.800 --> 15:53.800]  Yes, yes, exactly.
[15:53.800 --> 15:55.520]  They're already involved in.
[15:55.520 --> 15:56.520]  Right.
[15:56.520 --> 15:57.520]  Right.
[15:57.520 --> 15:58.520]  Right.
[15:58.520 --> 16:03.600]  And it's, you know, it all goes hand in hand where the cars are getting more computerized
[16:03.600 --> 16:04.600]  inside.
[16:04.600 --> 16:10.880]  I mean, it's, they've been computerized for a while in terms of things like when the anti-lock
[16:10.880 --> 16:14.960]  brakes kick in and stuff like that, but I mean like the user, you know, what you deal
[16:14.960 --> 16:15.960]  with, you know?
[16:15.960 --> 16:16.960]  Yeah.
[16:16.960 --> 16:17.960]  Have you shopped for a car recently?
[16:17.960 --> 16:22.080]  No, I have not shopped for a car since December, 2006.
[16:22.080 --> 16:26.640]  So last time I shopped for a car, the iPhone wasn't even out yet.
[16:26.640 --> 16:30.360]  I mean, some of that stuff is crazy.
[16:30.360 --> 16:41.480]  And I was going from, so I bought a new car in December and I was going from a 95 Integra.
[16:41.480 --> 16:49.880]  So I was not prepared for that level of screen in your face inside cars today.
[16:49.880 --> 16:53.720]  And I had an idea of the kind of cars that, you know, I had picked out certain cars to
[16:53.720 --> 16:57.880]  look at and my first reaction was just like, oh my God, there's just, I mean, there's,
[16:57.880 --> 17:03.680]  there's two, not only is there one big screen, there's two screens in this car and to do
[17:03.680 --> 17:10.080]  anything, you know, you have to be tapping a touch interface in order to like increase
[17:10.080 --> 17:12.200]  the airflow in the car and that kind of thing.
[17:12.200 --> 17:18.520]  And I was just like, I don't, that, A, I was not ready for that coming from an old car
[17:18.520 --> 17:23.760]  and B, I just don't think, I mean, well, there's actually, there's like B and C because B,
[17:23.760 --> 17:31.140]  I feel like driving, I would rather have some touch, some tactile elements and C, the interfaces
[17:31.140 --> 17:36.280]  that they make for these things are so bad, I didn't want, you know, I wanted to have
[17:36.280 --> 17:39.340]  as little commitment to that interface as possible.
[17:39.340 --> 17:43.000]  So I ended up getting a car that had this really, I mean, had the smallest screen that
[17:43.000 --> 17:47.160]  I could get, but you know, basically in a certain classic car, you kind of have to get
[17:47.160 --> 17:50.760]  that kind of screen with a crappy interface jammed into it.
[17:50.760 --> 17:51.760]  Yeah.
[17:51.760 --> 17:55.520]  I'm worried about that, about getting a new car because I feel like now it's no, when
[17:55.520 --> 18:00.620]  we got ours in 2006, we had the option to upgrade to a navigation system and I turned
[18:00.620 --> 18:04.960]  it down because I thought it looked so terrible and it wasn't the same, you know, it was like
[18:04.960 --> 18:08.160]  700 extra bucks or something like that.
[18:08.160 --> 18:11.280]  I turned it down, not because I didn't think the navigation would be useful, but just because
[18:11.280 --> 18:16.400]  I thought that without the navigation, they just put like a, you know, like an old school
[18:16.400 --> 18:19.880]  radio thing that takes up the space, like the screen isn't still there.
[18:19.880 --> 18:22.100]  So everything, nothing in our car has a touch screen.
[18:22.100 --> 18:24.640]  Everything is a dial that you twist and I like it.
[18:24.640 --> 18:25.820]  Right.
[18:25.820 --> 18:30.440]  And then my wife complained, Amy complained for a couple of years because every once in
[18:30.440 --> 18:34.520]  a while we'd go somewhere where we needed directions and you know, we didn't have a
[18:34.520 --> 18:35.520]  navigation system.
[18:35.520 --> 18:36.520]  Before the phone.
[18:36.520 --> 18:37.520]  Yeah.
[18:37.520 --> 18:38.520]  Right.
[18:38.520 --> 18:41.120]  And then once the, you know, and then that wore off, you know, I forget at what point
[18:41.120 --> 18:47.600]  the phone became a, uh, a decent, uh, navigation system probably by like 2010, right.
[18:47.600 --> 18:48.600]  Something like that.
[18:48.600 --> 18:49.600]  That seems about right.
[18:49.600 --> 18:53.800]  Um, so, you know, I think in the long run it worked out as a good decision, but I don't
[18:53.800 --> 18:58.020]  know what I'm going to do next, but it is true because it's like, you know, guys like
[18:58.020 --> 19:04.320]  us who lifelong Apple users, like we expect our computers interfaces to be Apple quality.
[19:04.320 --> 19:11.080]  And, you know, even at their worst, like pick the worst eras, you know, like MacOS 10, 10.0,
[19:11.080 --> 19:16.360]  uh, or something, it still was better than, you know, it wasn't ugly and it wasn't confusing,
[19:16.360 --> 19:17.360]  you know.
[19:17.360 --> 19:18.360]  Right.
[19:18.360 --> 19:21.880]  And I, I mean, I had my car for 20 years, I had that previous car for 20 years.
[19:21.880 --> 19:29.160]  I drove that thing and I wanted to possibly have the option to drive this almost as long.
[19:29.160 --> 19:35.560]  Um, and the idea of sticking with some of those systems that I'm, you know, feel like
[19:35.560 --> 19:42.640]  they're going to be obsolete in a year doesn't seem like it doesn't seem like a good way
[19:42.640 --> 19:43.640]  to win that game.
[19:43.640 --> 19:44.640]  No, it doesn't.
[19:44.640 --> 19:53.360]  Um, let's take a break and I will thank our first sponsor and it's a new sponsor, um,
[19:53.360 --> 19:54.360]  named automatic.
[19:54.360 --> 19:58.000]  If you heard of these guys speaking at cars, I have heard of automatic.
[19:58.000 --> 19:59.000]  Yes.
[19:59.000 --> 20:00.000]  It's a great segue.
[20:00.000 --> 20:04.720]  Um, automatic is a small connected car adapter.
[20:04.720 --> 20:07.160]  It plugs into your car's diagnostic port.
[20:07.160 --> 20:11.480]  Now every car has one of these, every modern car, uh, actually your old car didn't.
[20:11.480 --> 20:15.280]  Every car since 1996 has one of these ports, so it's a good thing you got rid of that piece
[20:15.280 --> 20:16.280]  of crap.
[20:16.280 --> 20:21.080]  Actually, I know it wasn't a piece of, I love the old, actually, I love the Acura Integra,
[20:21.080 --> 20:22.240]  but it was one year too young.
[20:22.240 --> 20:23.840]  Well, anyway, your new car has one.
[20:23.840 --> 20:24.840]  Every car has it.
[20:24.840 --> 20:28.840]  It's, it's a diagnostic port and when you take your car in for service, it's what your
[20:28.840 --> 20:33.760]  mechanic plugs, you know, their diagnostic stuff in, um, and has all sorts of information.
[20:33.760 --> 20:37.560]  Well, you, it's just, so this automatic, it's just a little dingus you plug in and you keep
[20:37.560 --> 20:43.640]  it there and then you pair to your phone and it connects your car, uh, to the internet.
[20:43.640 --> 20:44.640]  So what does it do?
[20:44.640 --> 20:46.900]  You can use it with their free mobile app, right?
[20:46.900 --> 20:49.560]  You just pay for the dingus and then you get a free app.
[20:49.560 --> 20:55.960]  Um, and if something like your check engine light comes on, right, that's just a light
[20:55.960 --> 20:58.040]  that just means something is wrong.
[20:58.040 --> 20:59.480]  Take this to an expert.
[20:59.480 --> 21:03.740]  Well, if you've got automatic, you could just fire up the app and it'll tell you in plain
[21:03.740 --> 21:07.760]  English exactly why the check English check engine light is on.
[21:07.760 --> 21:10.760]  You know, maybe it's something serious, maybe it's something silly.
[21:10.760 --> 21:15.600]  Um, and if it's something silly, you can use the app to clear the light.
[21:15.600 --> 21:19.320]  If it's a small problem right there from your phone, you can just say, ah, stop bugging me
[21:19.320 --> 21:20.320]  about that.
[21:20.320 --> 21:25.220]  Uh, log your trips and parking location so you never lose your car.
[21:25.220 --> 21:26.220]  That's pretty awesome.
[21:26.220 --> 21:29.000]  So you go to the airport, you're parking a parking garage or something like that.
[21:29.000 --> 21:33.960]  Um, you don't have to like take a photo or write down what, what your spot was.
[21:33.960 --> 21:40.600]  Um, the automatic does it for you automatically, uh, even with gas prices as low as they are
[21:40.600 --> 21:45.600]  right now, uh, your driving habits can be costing you hundreds of dollars per year.
[21:45.600 --> 21:51.040]  Automatic scores, your driving and coaches you to drive more effective, efficiently and
[21:51.040 --> 21:52.040]  safe.
[21:52.040 --> 21:53.440]  Um, so they're fans of the show.
[21:53.440 --> 21:56.960]  They remember back in the day, Merlin brought this up last week on the show, back in the
[21:56.960 --> 22:01.360]  day when I, uh, had my driver license taken away for driving 90, 90 miles an hour on the
[22:01.360 --> 22:02.360]  freeway.
[22:02.360 --> 22:06.600]  Uh, and our friends at automatic say, if I had automatic, it would have warned me that
[22:06.600 --> 22:09.200]  I was driving too fast and I wouldn't have lost my license.
[22:09.200 --> 22:11.680]  Um, now their default is 70 miles per hour.
[22:11.680 --> 22:15.620]  They give you a little like a tingle or something like that when you hit 70, but you can customize
[22:15.620 --> 22:16.620]  the speed.
[22:16.620 --> 22:19.480]  Um, so I'll tell, I would turn that up to like 89.
[22:19.480 --> 22:25.800]  Well, it's like I told Dan back in the day, I don't drive much, but when I do drive, I
[22:25.800 --> 22:30.080]  like to drive real fucking fast.
[22:30.080 --> 22:33.600]  Automatic can give you a warning, um, and crash detection.
[22:33.600 --> 22:37.160]  If you get this to say, God forbid you get in a terrible car accident, you get in a car
[22:37.160 --> 22:41.880]  accident, automatic can detect that and automatically call for help for free.
[22:41.880 --> 22:45.800]  Um, a human will even stay on the line with you until help arrives.
[22:45.800 --> 22:46.800]  Just call them right in.
[22:46.800 --> 22:51.220]  Um, it, they've got all sorts of new stuff, crazy stuff.
[22:51.220 --> 22:52.940]  They've got integration with nests.
[22:52.940 --> 22:58.240]  So if you've got nest, um, at your house, you can get it set up so that when your car
[22:58.240 --> 23:03.040]  gets close, your thermostat goes up or down or whatever you want, you can connect it to
[23:03.040 --> 23:04.040]  things like that.
[23:04.040 --> 23:05.040]  I can't get into it all here.
[23:05.040 --> 23:09.880]  You can connect it to Twitter, to Google docs, uh, connected home devices like those Phillips
[23:09.880 --> 23:12.320]  hue lights, all sorts of cool stuff.
[23:12.320 --> 23:13.320]  It's amazing.
[23:13.320 --> 23:18.080]  Um, uh, I think they use the, if this, then that, uh, to, to do that.
[23:18.080 --> 23:23.980]  You go to, if this I F T T T.com slash automatic and find out more about the cool automatic
[23:23.980 --> 23:24.980]  things you can do.
[23:24.980 --> 23:25.980]  Here's what you do.
[23:25.980 --> 23:26.980]  So what does it cost?
[23:26.980 --> 23:28.160]  This probably costs like $10,000, right?
[23:28.160 --> 23:31.040]  Just like a gold edition Apple watch.
[23:31.040 --> 23:32.040]  Nope.
[23:32.040 --> 23:35.200]  99 95 100 bucks.
[23:35.200 --> 23:38.680]  Well, then they're going to soak you on the subscription fees, right?
[23:38.680 --> 23:39.680]  Wrong.
[23:39.680 --> 23:41.560]  There are no subscription fees.
[23:41.560 --> 23:42.560]  What?
[23:42.560 --> 23:46.740]  You just buy the thing for 99 95 100 bucks.
[23:46.740 --> 23:51.320]  Stick it in your car's diagnostic port, get the free app and you're done.
[23:51.320 --> 23:52.320]  That's it.
[23:52.320 --> 23:57.640]  And let me tell you this, that's the sucker price listeners of this show.
[23:57.640 --> 24:01.180]  You get 20% off so you can get the thing for 80 bucks.
[24:01.180 --> 24:05.320]  Go to automatic.com slash talk show automatic.
[24:05.320 --> 24:07.960]  They just spell it the, the, the regular way.
[24:07.960 --> 24:16.320]  No funny spellings, um, for your Steve jobs fans out there, automatic.com slash talk show.
[24:16.320 --> 24:21.620]  Buy the thing for 80 bucks, 20% off, and just stick it in your car and start having fun.
[24:21.620 --> 24:23.600]  So my thanks to them, 80 bucks.
[24:23.600 --> 24:24.600]  I can't believe that.
[24:24.600 --> 24:25.600]  That's crazy.
[24:25.600 --> 24:30.700]  Honestly, you know, it's like the, in the marketing, there's always, or there's always
[24:30.700 --> 24:34.600]  those that, that, that branch of marketing that's, and it's all over the web these days,
[24:34.600 --> 24:39.520]  you know, like, uh, this, this one silly trick will make your mustache grow thicker, you
[24:39.520 --> 24:44.840]  know, um, you know, that, that, but it does seem to me like this diagnostic for, I didn't
[24:44.840 --> 24:45.840]  know anything about this.
[24:45.840 --> 24:49.640]  It seems like this diagnostic port on every car is like a serious, like they don't want
[24:49.640 --> 24:50.640]  you to know secret.
[24:50.640 --> 24:51.640]  Yeah.
[24:51.640 --> 24:52.640]  Right.
[24:52.640 --> 24:53.640]  Right.
[24:53.640 --> 24:56.720]  Like you can get all that information on your own, but they want you to come into the dealer
[24:56.720 --> 24:59.160]  for and pay $600 for the privilege.
[24:59.160 --> 25:00.160]  Right.
[25:00.160 --> 25:03.760]  Because if the car, you know, if it, if the car knows why the check engine light came
[25:03.760 --> 25:07.400]  on, they could easily, especially like we're, and it ties right into what we're saying,
[25:07.400 --> 25:13.400]  where modern cars all have real screens, so they could put any text you want on it.
[25:13.400 --> 25:14.400]  Right.
[25:14.400 --> 25:21.360]  So, uh, you know, by this thing, it's like, you're a sucker if you don't have it and you
[25:21.360 --> 25:24.680]  know what, and it's 80 bucks, you know, that your car dealer, if your car dealer gave you,
[25:24.680 --> 25:25.680]  this is an option.
[25:25.680 --> 25:26.680]  It would be like $800.
[25:26.680 --> 25:32.080]  It would be like an $800 option to have a smart car, 80 bucks.
[25:32.080 --> 25:34.080]  This is, uh, this is the most amazing thing.
[25:34.080 --> 25:39.640]  Um, I dunno, what do you, do you think Apple's working on a car?
[25:39.640 --> 25:40.640]  I don't know.
[25:40.640 --> 25:43.380]  I mean, it seems to me like one of those things, like maybe, you know, maybe they they're working
[25:43.380 --> 25:46.920]  on a lot of things and maybe that's one of the things they're kind of going, eh, you
[25:46.920 --> 25:50.320]  know, we should try this and see, see what we think.
[25:50.320 --> 25:56.320]  I mean, it's also just possible that the car that they're driving around is just full of
[25:56.320 --> 25:58.440]  like Apple carplay stuff.
[25:58.440 --> 26:06.000]  Wouldn't it be great if it was like just Bob Mansfield's group and just like to blow off
[26:06.000 --> 26:11.960]  some steam there, they like just bought an old Chrysler minivan, but they put it on the
[26:11.960 --> 26:16.480]  company's dime so that if anybody looked up the license plate, it would say it was registered
[26:16.480 --> 26:20.120]  to Apple, you know, Apple incorporated, right?
[26:20.120 --> 26:23.280]  So it's like, they paid for it out of petty cash because what they're saying, it's like
[26:23.280 --> 26:24.280]  a Chrysler minivan.
[26:24.280 --> 26:28.000]  So it's probably like 15 grand and then they just went to like home Depot and just bought
[26:28.000 --> 26:37.640]  like a whole bunch of PVC piping and made, made some crazy, and then just let the rumors,
[26:37.640 --> 26:42.640]  let the rumors stop, start like it's nothing.
[26:42.640 --> 26:46.960]  It's just like some, all it's being used for is some intern going out to pick up sandwiches
[26:46.960 --> 26:59.880]  and go about pick up some lunch and by the way, drive this car and drive real slow.
[26:59.880 --> 27:05.560]  Don't go, don't go more than 10 miles an hour.
[27:05.560 --> 27:06.800]  That's the type of shit that I would do that.
[27:06.800 --> 27:13.360]  See, that's why, that's why unlike Chris Breen, I'm never getting hired by Apple.
[27:13.360 --> 27:15.920]  All I would want to do is waste money on shit like that.
[27:15.920 --> 27:18.720]  Wouldn't that be a great job at Apple?
[27:18.720 --> 27:20.760]  That actually would be something you and I could do this.
[27:20.760 --> 27:26.000]  Like we would just start a team that would be like meant to just fill up the rumor blogs
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.000]  with deception.
[27:27.000 --> 27:28.000]  Yeah.
[27:28.000 --> 27:29.000]  Oh yeah.
[27:29.000 --> 27:30.000]  Oh my God.
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  We could have a lot of fun with that.
[27:32.000 --> 27:33.800]  That's right in my wheelhouse, man.
[27:33.800 --> 27:34.800]  Oh my God.
[27:34.800 --> 27:38.680]  I should call Schiller.
[27:38.680 --> 27:39.840]  We would just pick projects.
[27:39.840 --> 27:40.840]  Just pitch that.
[27:40.840 --> 27:42.840]  Just pitch that to Schiller.
[27:42.840 --> 27:48.840]  Pick projects that are plausible enough that you could get nine to five Mac and Mac rumors
[27:48.840 --> 27:56.000]  and Apple insider to run with them, but that are goofy enough that we would never stop
[27:56.000 --> 27:57.000]  laughing.
[27:57.000 --> 27:58.000]  Oh man.
[27:58.000 --> 27:59.000]  Yeah.
[27:59.000 --> 28:07.240]  Cause I have to say that the fact that the, that the supposed car that's been caught on
[28:07.240 --> 28:13.360]  a road is a Chrysler minivan really makes me think that that might be going on right
[28:13.360 --> 28:16.360]  now.
[28:16.360 --> 28:18.400]  And they're just laughing themselves silly.
[28:18.400 --> 28:21.680]  Cause it just seems like something like, like you would have started by saying, well, we'll
[28:21.680 --> 28:26.340]  do it in a, uh, like a Prius, like doesn't a Prius seem like the, like the default car
[28:26.340 --> 28:28.640]  you'd start with, you know, it's already electric.
[28:28.640 --> 28:33.280]  It's, you know, it's, it's there, they're all over the place in California.
[28:33.280 --> 28:41.380]  And then as somebody would have the idea, no, let's make it a minivan.
[28:41.380 --> 28:42.380]  That's the thing I found.
[28:42.380 --> 28:46.260]  I even wrote this on the, on the, the fireball site, uh, that with the wall street journal
[28:46.260 --> 28:50.040]  report that there got a hundred people working on a car that they said that it's a, looks
[28:50.040 --> 28:51.360]  like a minivan.
[28:51.360 --> 28:53.480]  I find that very hard to believe.
[28:53.480 --> 28:55.320]  I find that hard to believe too.
[28:55.320 --> 29:00.760]  Like I don't find it hard to believe that they might have some kind of super early prototype
[29:00.760 --> 29:03.940]  that looks like a minivan, but that's not what they said.
[29:03.940 --> 29:08.000]  They're saying that they're working on a car that looks like a minivan.
[29:08.000 --> 29:11.200]  You know, you know, like they always say like, this story is public knowledge and we can
[29:11.200 --> 29:14.200]  get to the whole Johnny Ive, New Yorker thing, but it's, it came up there.
[29:14.200 --> 29:17.920]  I think it came up in the jobs, but it came up all over the place where like the very
[29:17.920 --> 29:26.080]  early prototypes for what became multi-touch was like, uh, like projected on a desk and
[29:26.080 --> 29:27.080]  they had like cameras.
[29:27.080 --> 29:28.080]  I don't know.
[29:28.080 --> 29:31.320]  It was, it looked nothing like an iPad or a phone.
[29:31.320 --> 29:33.840]  It was big and it would like project on a wall.
[29:33.840 --> 29:38.240]  It was cause the sensors were, you know, weren't miniaturized yet.
[29:38.240 --> 29:39.240]  Yeah.
[29:39.240 --> 29:44.280]  Um, you know, I could see that the car, some kind of car that they intend to ship in 10
[29:44.280 --> 29:47.400]  years might look like that now because they need to fill up the back with all kinds of
[29:47.400 --> 29:50.080]  crazy stuff that they'll worry about miniaturizing later.
[29:50.080 --> 29:54.280]  But I can't believe that they're working on a car that would actually look like a minivan.
[29:54.280 --> 29:55.280]  No.
[29:55.280 --> 30:02.200]  Cause they would, I mean they would work on their car would be whatever the most, I mean
[30:02.200 --> 30:06.280]  their starter car would certainly be whatever the most purchased type of car is.
[30:06.280 --> 30:07.840]  And that's not a minivan.
[30:07.840 --> 30:08.840]  No.
[30:08.840 --> 30:12.720]  I mean it seems like it would be like a four door sedan.
[30:12.720 --> 30:13.720]  No.
[30:13.720 --> 30:16.520]  And they couldn't bring themselves to make something that wasn't beautiful.
[30:16.520 --> 30:17.520]  Right.
[30:17.520 --> 30:24.360]  You're saying Chrysler minivans aren't beautiful.
[30:24.360 --> 30:25.400]  Making somebody a Chrysler.
[30:25.400 --> 30:26.400]  Very sad right now.
[30:26.400 --> 30:30.840]  It'd be funny if it like drove Schiller out of the company because it's like, he just,
[30:30.840 --> 30:34.400]  you know, all right, I'll stop wearing my good, nice watches and wear this Apple watch.
[30:34.400 --> 30:40.240]  But if you want me to stop driving a Lotus or a Porsche and drive a minivan just because
[30:40.240 --> 30:43.200]  Apple has one, forget about it.
[30:43.200 --> 30:46.160]  I'm out taking my Porsche in my.
[30:46.160 --> 30:47.160]  Yeah.
[30:47.160 --> 30:49.960]  Whatever else he drives down to the Cayman islands.
[30:49.960 --> 30:50.960]  Yeah.
[30:50.960 --> 30:52.640]  He, yeah, he drives good cars.
[30:52.640 --> 30:56.000]  Johnny, Johnny obviously has a few cars.
[30:56.000 --> 30:57.000]  Yeah.
[30:57.000 --> 30:58.000]  And, but Williams.
[30:58.000 --> 30:59.000]  Yeah.
[30:59.000 --> 31:00.000]  Drives okay.
[31:00.000 --> 31:01.000]  An old Toyota Camry.
[31:01.000 --> 31:02.000]  Old Toyota Camry.
[31:02.000 --> 31:03.000]  Yeah.
[31:03.000 --> 31:04.000]  Which I think are good for him.
[31:04.000 --> 31:05.000]  I mean, I think that's great.
[31:05.000 --> 31:15.520]  I get the feeling that Jeff Williams is like, like a two thirds clone of Tim Cook.
[31:15.520 --> 31:19.600]  Like there's like a two thirds central, you know what I mean?
[31:19.600 --> 31:23.520]  Cause they used to say there was a profile of Tim Cook sometime in the last year or two
[31:23.520 --> 31:26.920]  where, where he apparently drove a very old car for a very long time.
[31:26.920 --> 31:27.920]  You know?
[31:27.920 --> 31:28.920]  That's right.
[31:28.920 --> 31:29.920]  I remember that.
[31:29.920 --> 31:32.740]  Um, you know, it was like when they said about what a mystery, you know, what our mystery
[31:32.740 --> 31:37.120]  was even to the people who we worked with, you know, on a daily basis, you know?
[31:37.120 --> 31:38.120]  Mm hmm.
[31:38.120 --> 31:40.480]  Well, for those guys, it's all about efficiency.
[31:40.480 --> 31:41.480]  Yeah.
[31:41.480 --> 31:46.040]  It just feels like an efficient operations, Oregon operations, and you want everything
[31:46.040 --> 31:47.040]  to run efficiently.
[31:47.040 --> 31:53.080]  And if you get something that's working great, just keep riding it.
[31:53.080 --> 31:55.080]  Yeah.
[31:55.080 --> 31:56.080]  Not me.
[31:56.080 --> 31:59.960]  I would, uh, you know, I would probably, if I had the, you know, Apple executive type
[31:59.960 --> 32:04.080]  money, I would probably be more like Steve jobs though, where he had the one car, you
[32:04.080 --> 32:08.320]  know, you know that he put a lot of thought into it and he had one car and it was awesome.
[32:08.320 --> 32:13.240]  Uh, but he was turning the lease over like every three weeks or something.
[32:13.240 --> 32:14.240]  Yeah.
[32:14.240 --> 32:18.920]  That's supposedly that's like, that was, that was supposedly how he got away with the never
[32:18.920 --> 32:23.240]  having a license plate was that he never had one for more than it's like, there's like,
[32:23.240 --> 32:26.240]  you got like 90 days before you have to have a license plate.
[32:26.240 --> 32:32.040]  And so like every three months, somebody would have to drive his Mercedes to the dealer and
[32:32.040 --> 32:33.160]  I'm sure they just had one waiting.
[32:33.160 --> 32:37.960]  It's like a box of tissues, you know, they just pull
[32:37.960 --> 32:45.720]  another silver Mercedes SL 50 with the, you know, precise interior right out of the box.
[32:45.720 --> 32:46.720]  Boom.
[32:46.720 --> 32:49.480]  Then he's, he's got it again.
[32:49.480 --> 32:50.840]  Right.
[32:50.840 --> 32:54.440]  I couldn't see, I could never see being a car collector because I could see buying one
[32:54.440 --> 32:57.680]  really nice car and then I would drive it everywhere, but I would want to put all my
[32:57.680 --> 33:03.640]  effort into making that pick up front and picking the one that I, that I love.
[33:03.640 --> 33:08.680]  I, if I had even two, I don't know how I would make the decision on any given day.
[33:08.680 --> 33:11.560]  I would, it would know which one to drive.
[33:11.560 --> 33:12.560]  Right.
[33:12.560 --> 33:13.560]  Yeah.
[33:13.560 --> 33:14.560]  Yeah.
[33:14.560 --> 33:17.200]  Like I like not having to make decisions like that.
[33:17.200 --> 33:19.200]  Yeah.
[33:19.200 --> 33:21.400]  I feel that way now that I have, I have like two good cameras.
[33:21.400 --> 33:25.360]  I have one that a Canon that's bigger and a little, you know, still a little bit better
[33:25.360 --> 33:30.780]  and more flexible cause it has multiple lenses and then I've got this a Fuji X 100 S which
[33:30.780 --> 33:31.780]  is delightful.
[33:31.780 --> 33:36.520]  It's that retro, you know, sort of looks like an old rangefinder, beautiful camera, a lot
[33:36.520 --> 33:39.760]  lighter really, you know, and unless I know that I'm going to be walking around with it
[33:39.760 --> 33:43.240]  on my neck all day, I know I want the lighter one, but there's a lot of like school events
[33:43.240 --> 33:45.920]  and stuff where it's like, I don't know which one to take and then I think, why did I buy
[33:45.920 --> 33:46.920]  a second camera?
[33:46.920 --> 33:51.760]  Now I'm sitting here, you know, 10 minutes staring at two cameras.
[33:51.760 --> 33:58.000]  Well, I guess, I mean for those guys, I guess it's just, that's the fun of it, right?
[33:58.000 --> 34:02.040]  Because part of the fun is like, Oh man, I drove the wrong car today.
[34:02.040 --> 34:03.040]  I guess.
[34:03.040 --> 34:04.040]  I don't know.
[34:04.040 --> 34:05.120]  I should have driven though.
[34:05.120 --> 34:07.480]  Maybe I guess too famously, right.
[34:07.480 --> 34:10.640]  And I guess if they break down all the time because they're all finicky, Italian sports
[34:10.640 --> 34:18.000]  cars, you know, also part of the fun, right?
[34:18.000 --> 34:19.000]  You know what would be funny too?
[34:19.000 --> 34:22.360]  Cause I guess the assumption is like, I'm like, look at like Apple watch.
[34:22.360 --> 34:29.040]  So there's variety, but they're, you know, there's just one shape, you know, two sizes.
[34:29.040 --> 34:34.080]  Imagine like what the parking lot at Apple's new headquarters will look like, like three
[34:34.080 --> 34:43.760]  years after the Apple car comes out when everybody's driving the same model car, I presume that
[34:43.760 --> 34:50.040]  they'll just bake in some kind of app that tells you which silver Apple car is yours.
[34:50.040 --> 34:53.520]  Where's my silver Apple car.
[34:53.520 --> 34:59.680]  Oh boy.
[34:59.680 --> 35:01.240]  Look forward to that problem.
[35:01.240 --> 35:02.240]  Yeah.
[35:02.240 --> 35:06.100]  So the big problem, one of the big problems with cars and Tesla famously is running into
[35:06.100 --> 35:12.160]  it all over the country is that there's this bizarre, well, it seems bizarre in hindsight,
[35:12.160 --> 35:17.600]  these bizarre laws, they're not even rules, they're laws about how cars are sold, that
[35:17.600 --> 35:21.480]  are, there's this dealership model and I forget the explanation.
[35:21.480 --> 35:28.220]  It makes sense historically and doesn't make sense in the present day.
[35:28.220 --> 35:34.040]  But the reason why all cars are sold through these independent dealers that's like the
[35:34.040 --> 35:36.820]  law and Tesla doesn't want to get involved with that.
[35:36.820 --> 35:43.420]  They want to sell directly and they have to go like state by state and get stuff you know,
[35:43.420 --> 35:45.920]  make it legal, right?
[35:45.920 --> 35:48.280]  Like New Jersey.
[35:48.280 --> 35:49.280]  Like New Jersey, right?
[35:49.280 --> 35:50.280]  They haven't.
[35:50.280 --> 35:51.280]  They just don't sell them in New Jersey.
[35:51.280 --> 35:52.280]  Yeah.
[35:52.280 --> 35:57.920]  New Jersey, it seems like some Sopranos type guys have some of the action in the car dealerships
[35:57.920 --> 36:03.120]  and they're sort of like, yeah, you ain't going to be selling your little electric cars
[36:03.120 --> 36:08.960]  here.
[36:08.960 --> 36:12.480]  The same guys who run the gas pumps.
[36:12.480 --> 36:13.480]  Yeah.
[36:13.480 --> 36:16.000]  Have we talked about that?
[36:16.000 --> 36:17.940]  I feel like you and I have talked about this on the show.
[36:17.940 --> 36:18.940]  This is the craziest thing.
[36:18.940 --> 36:19.940]  Maybe, yeah.
[36:19.940 --> 36:22.920]  So for those of you out there who don't know, I've never been to New Jersey and New Jersey
[36:22.920 --> 36:29.360]  is it all gasoline is pumped by a professional.
[36:29.360 --> 36:31.360]  There is no.
[36:31.360 --> 36:32.360]  Oregon's the same way.
[36:32.360 --> 36:33.360]  Oregon's the same way.
[36:33.360 --> 36:34.360]  Is it really?
[36:34.360 --> 36:37.200]  So are you West Coasters know what you're doing or know what I'm talking about?
[36:37.200 --> 36:41.240]  So I think most people around the country, when you pull in a gas station and it says
[36:41.240 --> 36:44.680]  self-serve, you're like, well, why, you know, of course, well, guess what?
[36:44.680 --> 36:47.800]  New Jersey has no self-serve, not there's no option.
[36:47.800 --> 36:52.880]  It's legally, you have to have your gas pumped by an attendant.
[36:52.880 --> 36:57.920]  And I don't know, it's three or four years ago, they got it as a state referendum.
[36:57.920 --> 36:58.960]  And I thought, Whoa, great.
[36:58.960 --> 36:59.960]  This is great.
[36:59.960 --> 37:01.480]  Cause I go to New Jersey sometimes and I thought, this is great.
[37:01.480 --> 37:04.200]  I'll finally be able to pump my own gas.
[37:04.200 --> 37:05.200]  Nope.
[37:05.200 --> 37:12.560]  New Jersey is devoted overwhelmingly to keep the law on the books.
[37:12.560 --> 37:13.960]  It's like Stockholm syndrome.
[37:13.960 --> 37:18.460]  Like they're afraid to pump gas.
[37:18.460 --> 37:19.960]  They see it as some kind of luxury.
[37:19.960 --> 37:23.840]  I mean, the guy, the, the, the last time I pulled up to a gas pump in New Jersey, which
[37:23.840 --> 37:28.080]  was last summer, the guy called me boss.
[37:28.080 --> 37:29.720]  That was pretty, that was, that was kind of nice.
[37:29.720 --> 37:32.040]  Well, that's actually in the law as well.
[37:32.040 --> 37:33.200]  They all, they have to say that.
[37:33.200 --> 37:34.860]  Well, there's a, you know, you have choices.
[37:34.860 --> 37:35.860]  They can call you boss.
[37:35.860 --> 37:36.860]  They can call you chief.
[37:36.860 --> 37:37.860]  Chief.
[37:37.860 --> 37:38.860]  Yeah.
[37:38.860 --> 37:40.880]  I was trying to remember if it was boss or chief actually.
[37:40.880 --> 37:41.880]  Yeah.
[37:41.880 --> 37:43.680]  And and they can call you hoss.
[37:43.680 --> 37:47.080]  I think you have to pay extra for hoss though.
[37:47.080 --> 37:48.080]  Yeah.
[37:48.080 --> 37:49.080]  But they could definitely call you chief.
[37:49.080 --> 37:50.080]  They can call you boss.
[37:50.080 --> 37:51.080]  Extra.
[37:51.080 --> 37:55.200]  It's an extra 5 cents a gallon.
[37:55.200 --> 38:02.200]  Fill it up and go ahead and hoss that.
[38:02.200 --> 38:03.200]  Absolutely hoss.
[38:03.200 --> 38:04.200]  Yeah.
[38:04.200 --> 38:05.200]  It's a slogan actually.
[38:05.200 --> 38:16.360]  When I was a kid, it was a slogan at Hess gas stations, Hosset at Hess.
[38:16.360 --> 38:17.360]  So yeah.
[38:17.360 --> 38:18.360]  Yeah.
[38:18.360 --> 38:19.360]  I don't know.
[38:19.360 --> 38:23.440]  Those guys will be out of a, out of a job if we're all driving Apple electric Apple
[38:23.440 --> 38:24.440]  cars.
[38:24.440 --> 38:27.360]  So I don't know.
[38:27.360 --> 38:35.040]  I mean, anything that Apple does in this would have to, you know, go through the same rigmarole
[38:35.040 --> 38:36.920]  that Tesla's going through.
[38:36.920 --> 38:39.280]  Who knows?
[38:39.280 --> 38:40.280]  I don't know.
[38:40.280 --> 38:44.280]  I think it, like you said, I think it's, you know, a maybe kind of sort of someday thing
[38:44.280 --> 38:45.560]  and they're just looking into it.
[38:45.560 --> 38:46.560]  Yeah.
[38:46.560 --> 38:47.720]  Particularly if it looks like a Chrysler minivan right now.
[38:47.720 --> 38:52.000]  I mean, it's obviously not, it's obviously not ready to go onto the showroom floor anytime
[38:52.000 --> 38:53.000]  soon.
[38:53.000 --> 38:54.460]  All right.
[38:54.460 --> 38:55.480]  The self-driving thing.
[38:55.480 --> 38:56.560]  I do think it's coming.
[38:56.560 --> 39:02.520]  I have no idea when to think it's obviously not imminent, you know, it's, it's, uh, but
[39:02.520 --> 39:07.100]  it feels like something that could be like, you know, we're not going to have to wait
[39:07.100 --> 39:08.100]  till we're old men.
[39:08.100 --> 39:11.600]  Like we'll, we'll, we'll get to this in 10 or 15 years.
[39:11.600 --> 39:12.600]  Yeah.
[39:12.600 --> 39:13.600]  Yeah.
[39:13.600 --> 39:14.600]  Maybe it's, yeah.
[39:14.600 --> 39:18.760]  Cause it's a, you think back 10 years, I think back 10 years and I think about like the laptop
[39:18.760 --> 39:22.200]  I was using, it's pretty astounding.
[39:22.200 --> 39:23.880]  I've been thinking about that a lot lately.
[39:23.880 --> 39:28.680]  And I, maybe it's always that 10 years is, you know, gives you a lot of eye openers and
[39:28.680 --> 39:30.500]  technology probably does.
[39:30.500 --> 39:34.880]  But somehow while we're still on the other side of the iPhone being 10 years, it really
[39:34.880 --> 39:41.780]  feels like right now, like 2015, 2016, it's the, the, what life was like 10 years ago
[39:41.780 --> 39:43.640]  was pretty, pretty crazy.
[39:43.640 --> 39:44.640]  Yeah.
[39:44.640 --> 39:48.600]  2015 might be the big one to me, especially as an Apple nerd, just because there's no
[39:48.600 --> 39:50.080]  iPhone yet.
[39:50.080 --> 39:57.200]  Um, Max, we're still power PC trying to think what else?
[39:57.200 --> 39:58.200]  Yeah.
[39:58.200 --> 39:59.200]  Titanium.
[39:59.200 --> 40:01.840]  I think I was having a titanium power book back then.
[40:01.840 --> 40:02.840]  Yeah.
[40:02.840 --> 40:03.840]  Might've still been iBooks.
[40:03.840 --> 40:12.120]  Um, yeah, yeah, they still had the plastic was first plastic iBooks were still being
[40:12.120 --> 40:13.120]  sold.
[40:13.120 --> 40:17.400]  And the nicer plastic ones, the one that were available, white and black were, were Mac
[40:17.400 --> 40:20.280]  books, I believe, right?
[40:20.280 --> 40:21.640]  Mac books and Mac book pros.
[40:21.640 --> 40:22.640]  Uh, yes.
[40:22.640 --> 40:23.640]  Yeah.
[40:23.640 --> 40:24.640]  Yeah.
[40:24.640 --> 40:27.720]  Those are, those were all Intel, right?
[40:27.720 --> 40:28.720]  And they were nicer.
[40:28.720 --> 40:29.720]  I think.
[40:29.720 --> 40:30.720]  Yeah.
[40:30.720 --> 40:35.560]  So I think I still have, probably still have that laptop here.
[40:35.560 --> 40:36.560]  I've got them all.
[40:36.560 --> 40:40.760]  I'm looking at it yet because I have a problem.
[40:40.760 --> 40:42.120]  It's not funny.
[40:42.120 --> 40:43.440]  I have a problem.
[40:43.440 --> 40:44.440]  Yeah.
[40:44.440 --> 40:51.160]  I can't wait till we all retire in the old folks home and we're all just, uh, if we need
[40:51.160 --> 40:58.360]  all this extra closet space, you're going to copy a tiger, Syracuse has got a bunch
[40:58.360 --> 40:59.360]  of stuff too.
[40:59.360 --> 41:00.360]  I don't know.
[41:00.360 --> 41:01.360]  I got a, you bet.
[41:01.360 --> 41:02.360]  I got a copy of tiger.
[41:02.360 --> 41:03.360]  You know what though?
[41:03.360 --> 41:04.360]  I don't have any old desktop max.
[41:04.360 --> 41:10.600]  Like I don't have like an old, uh, uh, I got my G four, you know, like a Mac classics frame
[41:10.600 --> 41:16.560]  Mac or anything like that, Oh no, I got, yeah, I got, I got one of those, I can do it actually.
[41:16.560 --> 41:17.560]  Yeah.
[41:17.560 --> 41:18.560]  Two.
[41:18.560 --> 41:19.560]  I got two of those.
[41:19.560 --> 41:21.040]  If I were going to buy one, my wife listened to this.
[41:21.040 --> 41:23.200]  She's going to have a shit fit.
[41:23.200 --> 41:27.720]  I would want to buy an se 30 se 30 is the law makes my heart race.
[41:27.720 --> 41:33.040]  I have an se, um, it's not, it's not a 30, but I do have an se cause that was, that was
[41:33.040 --> 41:38.200]  my first, that was my first Mac and it's base it's, it's basically the same machine, which
[41:38.200 --> 41:43.360]  I, you know, I bought for $2,000 in 1990 used.
[41:43.360 --> 41:48.160]  And then, uh, years later I still had all the floppies and I had sold the machine a
[41:48.160 --> 41:52.400]  long time ago and I was like, ah, I want to, I want to try these floppies out again.
[41:52.400 --> 41:53.400]  So I bought another one.
[41:53.400 --> 41:56.360]  I bought the basically the same thing off eBay for a buck.
[41:56.360 --> 41:58.520]  I've got my floppies somewhere.
[41:58.520 --> 41:59.760]  I know I didn't throw them out.
[41:59.760 --> 42:02.540]  I cannot believe that any of them would still work.
[42:02.540 --> 42:06.720]  They used to fail when they were, yeah, I know that's a great, yeah.
[42:06.720 --> 42:08.520]  Most of them, so most of mine still work.
[42:08.520 --> 42:09.520]  A lot of them do fail though.
[42:09.520 --> 42:12.160]  They used to fail brand new.
[42:12.160 --> 42:20.440]  Yeah, maybe it was just like the ones and zeros were just little pieces of dust stuck
[42:20.440 --> 42:28.880]  to the disc by static electricity.
[42:28.880 --> 42:33.760]  We're only one megabyte, but we're more reliable than zip.
[42:33.760 --> 42:40.560]  Oh man, uh, I did remember that though.
[42:40.560 --> 42:43.920]  That reminds me though that the other thing in that the Wall Street Journal had a couple
[42:43.920 --> 42:50.320]  of reports this week and the one was about the, uh, um, I think I wrote, I think it's
[42:50.320 --> 42:51.320]  such bullshit.
[42:51.320 --> 42:54.520]  This thing that the Apple watch, you know, like at the last minute they took out all
[42:54.520 --> 42:59.040]  it was supposed to be like a fitness health device and then they, none of the sensors
[42:59.040 --> 43:00.040]  worked.
[43:00.040 --> 43:03.840]  They took out and had to redefine what it was for.
[43:03.840 --> 43:07.760]  Um, it, uh, but it did say that, I don't know who knows.
[43:07.760 --> 43:11.360]  I think it was so poorly sourced who knows even knows if the number even came from anybody
[43:11.360 --> 43:15.500]  who knows what the hell they're talking about, but that the, uh, Apple watch gold edition
[43:15.500 --> 43:21.800]  is expected to sell for 4,000 or more, which would make it the most expensive product they
[43:21.800 --> 43:26.960]  sell, you know, I've ever sold or something like that compared to the wrong to the current
[43:26.960 --> 43:27.960]  Mac pro.
[43:27.960 --> 43:30.840]  I was thinking what you thought, I thought about the kid in college who had the Mac two
[43:30.840 --> 43:34.680]  FX that that was like a $10,000 computer at the time.
[43:34.680 --> 43:35.680]  Yeah.
[43:35.680 --> 43:40.280]  Uh, it's like, no, that is not, I remember when I like the cheap ones, like you said,
[43:40.280 --> 43:44.720]  like an se was 2000 my, my Mac LC was like $2,500.
[43:44.720 --> 43:52.520]  I mean, you know, and then there you've got the 20th anniversary one, which I forget what
[43:52.520 --> 43:56.360]  that went for, but that was over $10,000 at least, right?
[43:56.360 --> 44:06.960]  My parents spent more on my computer, that $2,500 LC than they spent on the college.
[44:06.960 --> 44:08.980]  It was crazy expensive.
[44:08.980 --> 44:10.600]  Everything was crazy expensive.
[44:10.600 --> 44:16.040]  I remember when I wrote that somebody on, uh, uh, Twitter wrote that they had a two
[44:16.040 --> 44:17.040]  CI at the time.
[44:17.040 --> 44:19.160]  Remember the Mac two CI?
[44:19.160 --> 44:22.400]  Was that the, the road Apple one or was that it?
[44:22.400 --> 44:26.760]  The Mac two CI was, it was right down the middle of the road.
[44:26.760 --> 44:31.960]  It was, uh, the type of desktop you could, I think it was, you could, you could put it
[44:31.960 --> 44:34.000]  both ways on your desk, like a PlayStation.
[44:34.000 --> 44:37.280]  You could have it standing up, but you could turn it on its side and put like, it was perfectly
[44:37.280 --> 44:40.640]  sized for the 13 inch display.
[44:40.640 --> 44:47.760]  Um, I, I would hold it up as I think the greatest Mac Apple ever made because they, it was in
[44:47.760 --> 44:53.240]  their lineup for like five years, like, like around 90 or 91, when it came out, it was
[44:53.240 --> 44:58.880]  a high end machine, like right below like the two effects, like five, six, seven, $8,000,
[44:58.880 --> 45:00.400]  something like that.
[45:00.400 --> 45:03.920]  And they kept it for years, you know, and it would just drop down.
[45:03.920 --> 45:07.920]  It was sort of like the first, you know, like what they do with the phones now, like the
[45:07.920 --> 45:12.060]  next year it just stayed and, and sold, you know, cause it was still, it was like such
[45:12.060 --> 45:16.240]  a good machine and so fast at the time, it was a great, great, great computer.
[45:16.240 --> 45:21.360]  One of my friends in college had one and loved it, Mac two CI, but anyway, someone on Twitter
[45:21.360 --> 45:24.080]  reminded me about how expensive Ram was back then.
[45:24.080 --> 45:29.360]  Like he said he had a two, got a two CI in the early nineties and spent $5,800 on Ram.
[45:29.360 --> 45:31.960]  Oh my God.
[45:31.960 --> 45:36.360]  People have no idea how expensive computers are in the nineties and then guys like us
[45:36.360 --> 45:39.960]  would just wonder, why isn't everybody into computers?
[45:39.960 --> 45:44.120]  What's the matter?
[45:44.120 --> 45:51.320]  $8,800 on Ram, because of course, like the default, it was like a $6,000 computer in
[45:51.320 --> 45:52.320]  1991.
[45:52.320 --> 45:59.200]  And I bet the default config was like two megs, two megabytes of ramp.
[45:59.200 --> 46:00.200]  Just terrible.
[46:00.200 --> 46:01.200]  Yeah.
[46:01.200 --> 46:06.080]  I think my LC had one, one megabyte around, oh, really by default.
[46:06.080 --> 46:11.320]  I've eventually, that sounds about right at some point over the years, I scrimped and
[46:11.320 --> 46:17.860]  saved and got it upgraded to 10, which was, it doesn't even make any sense.
[46:17.860 --> 46:19.860]  Maybe it had two, maybe it had two to start with.
[46:19.860 --> 46:23.680]  Maybe that was it had two soldered on the motherboard and I could put, you could add
[46:23.680 --> 46:27.240]  two four megabyte chips and get it up to 10.
[46:27.240 --> 46:28.800]  I don't know.
[46:28.800 --> 46:34.040]  Somebody could look it up, but I'm not going to.
[46:34.040 --> 46:39.040]  Let's take a break and then maybe we could talk about the, the Johnny Ive mini book in
[46:39.040 --> 46:44.880]  New York.
[46:44.880 --> 46:46.960]  Let me tell you, it's our good friends.
[46:46.960 --> 46:47.960]  Our next sponsor.
[46:47.960 --> 46:50.440]  It's our good friends at Squarespace.
[46:50.440 --> 46:51.440]  You guys know Squarespace.
[46:51.440 --> 46:55.940]  It's the all in one, build your own website platform.
[46:55.940 --> 46:58.280]  You go to Squarespace and you can do everything.
[46:58.280 --> 46:59.840]  They host your website.
[46:59.840 --> 47:03.840]  They give you all the tools you need to design your website.
[47:03.840 --> 47:07.940]  They have templates that you can start with, so you're not starting from a blank slate.
[47:07.940 --> 47:11.800]  They have all sorts of, I don't know if you want to call them apps, you'd want to call
[47:11.800 --> 47:17.640]  them features, things that you can add to configure your website, drag and drop interface.
[47:17.640 --> 47:20.640]  Everything is WYSIWYG, very, very visual.
[47:20.640 --> 47:25.240]  You do not need any sort of technical expertise to do it.
[47:25.240 --> 47:29.920]  If you do have technical expertise though, you can get into the code, you can inject
[47:29.920 --> 47:33.920]  your own JavaScript, stuff like that.
[47:33.920 --> 47:37.840]  The new Squarespace seven, which just came out at the end of last year.
[47:37.840 --> 47:40.460]  You can find out more just about these features.
[47:40.460 --> 47:47.600]  Go to squarespace.com slash seven S-E-V-E-N and find out more information about the new
[47:47.600 --> 47:48.600]  stuff.
[47:48.600 --> 47:51.000]  But just tip of the iceberg, here we go.
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.080]  They've got integration with Google apps now.
[47:53.080 --> 47:56.080]  They have a partnership with Getty images.
[47:56.080 --> 48:02.480]  So if you're doing the sort of site where you need a stock photography or stock illustration
[48:02.480 --> 48:07.240]  and stuff like that, you could do it right through Squarespace with their partnership
[48:07.240 --> 48:09.080]  with Getty images.
[48:09.080 --> 48:15.240]  New templates, they have things called now cover pages, or if you want to have a site,
[48:15.240 --> 48:18.720]  like if it's like a business or something like that where you want the front page to
[48:18.720 --> 48:22.560]  be sort of like a cover where you have to click to go through, you could build that
[48:22.560 --> 48:24.320]  now.
[48:24.320 --> 48:25.920]  Just really, really great stuff.
[48:25.920 --> 48:26.920]  Everything is beautiful.
[48:26.920 --> 48:32.360]  That's the thing about Squarespace is they really, really have the eye for design and
[48:32.360 --> 48:37.540]  everything from not just the templates that you build and what people see when they visit
[48:37.540 --> 48:42.840]  your site, but your interface as the person behind the site, that stuff you use to configure
[48:42.840 --> 48:43.840]  it.
[48:43.840 --> 48:50.000]  Really, really beautiful and elegant design, attractive and really smart UI design that
[48:50.000 --> 48:57.120]  really helps you understand what's going on 24 seven support via live chat and email.
[48:57.120 --> 48:59.820]  They don't have telephone support because who wants to talk on the phone?
[48:59.820 --> 49:00.820]  Just do it by chat.
[49:00.820 --> 49:03.640]  It's much easier.
[49:03.640 --> 49:04.640]  Here's the thing.
[49:04.640 --> 49:10.640]  You get all of this world class hosting, world class design, all these features, eight bucks

[49:25.420 --> 49:27.880]  out next month or whatever.
[49:27.880 --> 49:29.040]  Everything's going to look great.
[49:29.040 --> 49:30.040]  Every site comes with commerce.
[49:30.040 --> 49:31.400]  You don't have to pay extra for that.
[49:31.400 --> 49:35.080]  So if you have stuff to sell, you want to sell stuff online, just go there.
[49:35.080 --> 49:36.440]  So where do you go to find out more?

[50:12.760 --> 50:15.160]  of the talk show.
[50:15.160 --> 50:19.540]  Great friends of the show.
[50:19.540 --> 50:30.300]  So the New Yorker piece, 17,000 words almost by Ian Parker on Johnny Ive and the design
[50:30.300 --> 50:31.600]  team at Apple.
[50:31.600 --> 50:36.400]  I'm almost through it.
[50:36.400 --> 50:37.400]  I had no idea.
[50:37.400 --> 50:38.400]  It was funny.
[50:38.400 --> 50:39.400]  I didn't know.
[50:39.400 --> 50:40.400]  I didn't do like a word count at first.
[50:40.400 --> 50:42.400]  I just, I woke up and there was a lot.
[50:42.400 --> 50:43.400]  Everybody was tweeting about it.
[50:43.400 --> 50:46.520]  I thought, Ooh, this is intriguing.
[50:46.520 --> 50:52.080]  Because it was very clear right from the opening that this was written with their, you know,
[50:52.080 --> 51:00.820]  Apple's and Johnny Ive's participation, cooperation, which in and of itself is maybe the most interesting
[51:00.820 --> 51:04.200]  and intriguing thing about it.
[51:04.200 --> 51:07.080]  And it literally took me hours.
[51:07.080 --> 51:11.780]  I started thinking like, am I, have I gotten slow at my, am I addled?
[51:11.780 --> 51:16.120]  Why is it taking me so long to read a magazine article?
[51:16.120 --> 51:20.720]  And then I counted the words and I was like, wait a minute, that's like a third of a book.
[51:20.720 --> 51:24.840]  A book is like 60,000 words.
[51:24.840 --> 51:25.840]  Truly extraordinary.
[51:25.840 --> 51:26.840]  You gotta wait.
[51:26.840 --> 51:27.840]  You gotta wait to act three to get to you.
[51:27.840 --> 51:28.840]  Yeah.
[51:28.840 --> 51:29.840]  That was a surprise.
[51:29.840 --> 51:31.400]  I actually had no idea.
[51:31.400 --> 51:32.480]  That was a total surprise.
[51:32.480 --> 51:37.320]  So like two thirds of the way through the article, like 12,000 words into it.
[51:37.320 --> 51:42.920]  Yes, there was a mention, a quote from me.
[51:42.920 --> 51:46.880]  And I have to say that was like a total, I mean, I'm used to people quoting me and seeing
[51:46.880 --> 51:52.440]  my name, but in the New Yorker, it was kind of a surprise slash shock slash thrill.
[51:52.440 --> 51:53.440]  Yeah.
[51:53.440 --> 51:54.440]  Yeah.
[51:54.440 --> 51:55.440]  I would think so.
[51:55.440 --> 51:56.440]  I wouldn't know, but I would think so.
[51:56.440 --> 51:58.440]  Oh, you didn't, they didn't quote you?
[51:58.440 --> 51:59.440]  They didn't.
[51:59.440 --> 52:00.440]  I don't think I'm in this.
[52:00.440 --> 52:01.440]  That's very strange.
[52:01.440 --> 52:07.320]  Wait, I'm trying to find the URL here.
[52:07.320 --> 52:09.320]  I probably should have loaded this up before.
[52:09.320 --> 52:13.760]  It'll take a lot of load.
[52:13.760 --> 52:16.520]  My dick's scaped down.
[52:16.520 --> 52:21.040]  Here's where I was hoping that here's what it says.
[52:21.040 --> 52:22.960]  This is actually an interesting point.
[52:22.960 --> 52:25.060]  This is like the type of thing I like to talk about on talk show.
[52:25.060 --> 52:30.660]  So it's at a point where they're talking about Apple watch and that they've hired Angela
[52:30.660 --> 52:34.000]  Arens from Burberry and Paul Deneve.
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.320]  I'm not quite sure how to pronounce his name.
[52:36.320 --> 52:39.680]  He's the former CEO of the Eve St. Laurent group.
[52:39.680 --> 52:46.440]  Patrick Bruno, I hope I'm pronouncing his name correctly from Tag Hauer.
[52:46.440 --> 52:48.840]  Hope I'm pronouncing Tag Hauer, right?
[52:48.840 --> 52:49.840]  Hoyer Tag Hoyer.
[52:49.840 --> 52:50.840]  All right.
[52:50.840 --> 52:51.840]  Tag Hoyer.
[52:51.840 --> 52:52.840]  Thank you, John.
[52:52.840 --> 52:53.840]  Yeah.
[52:53.840 --> 52:54.840]  I didn't know about the second two.
[52:54.840 --> 52:55.840]  I mean, obviously I knew about the first one.
[52:55.840 --> 52:59.280]  No, I knew about him and you know, I think I knew about that from Ben Thompson because
[52:59.280 --> 53:02.760]  Ben is really, really knows his shit about the luxury industry.
[53:02.760 --> 53:06.020]  Like LVMH is such an interesting company, right?
[53:06.020 --> 53:08.300]  Because they're like a huge luxury conglomerate.
[53:08.300 --> 53:15.880]  The LV in LVMH is a Louis Vuitton handbag suitcase, luxury shoemaker.
[53:15.880 --> 53:20.440]  And MH is the, I forget what the H is.
[53:20.440 --> 53:22.320]  Oh, H is Hennessy.
[53:22.320 --> 53:23.320]  Like the, what is that?
[53:23.320 --> 53:24.320]  Cognac?
[53:24.320 --> 53:25.320]  Yeah.
[53:25.320 --> 53:26.920]  One of the few, few, few boozes.
[53:26.920 --> 53:28.440]  I'm not really that familiar with them.
[53:28.440 --> 53:29.440]  M is Moet.
[53:29.440 --> 53:32.440]  M-O-E-T, the champagne.
[53:32.440 --> 53:40.320]  Handbags, champagne, expensive cognac and watches.
[53:40.320 --> 53:45.880]  It's a very, it's an interesting conglomerate, but yeah, they hired a watch guy from there
[53:45.880 --> 53:55.000]  and he was a guy, his job at Tag Hower was, or Hoyer was, he dealt with their like retail
[53:55.000 --> 53:56.000]  liaisons.
[53:56.000 --> 53:57.520]  Like he wasn't like a watch designer.
[53:57.520 --> 53:59.820]  He wasn't from like the creating of the watches.
[53:59.820 --> 54:04.980]  He was one of the guys who dealt with their, you know, like which jewelry stores are going
[54:04.980 --> 54:07.880]  to sell, you know, which watches and stuff like that.
[54:07.880 --> 54:09.960]  And what are they, you know, negotiating that sort of stuff.
[54:09.960 --> 54:14.800]  So it's an interesting hire because there's circling all the way back to the things we
[54:14.800 --> 54:17.440]  don't know about Apple Watch.
[54:17.440 --> 54:24.400]  If we're right, that the high end edition is going to be, let's say four, five, $10,000,
[54:24.400 --> 54:27.160]  something like that, how and where are you going to buy it?
[54:27.160 --> 54:31.160]  Because the Apple stores as they exist today are not the sort of place where you go and
[54:31.160 --> 54:33.720]  spend $10,000 on a watch, right?
[54:33.720 --> 54:37.400]  You don't buy them in a noisy, cacophonous room where, you know.
[54:37.400 --> 54:38.400]  Right.
[54:38.400 --> 54:40.840]  You're not going to do that thing where you, you prepay and you come in and pick it up
[54:40.840 --> 54:41.840]  and just walk out.
[54:41.840 --> 54:42.840]  Yeah.
[54:42.840 --> 54:43.840]  Charge it to my vote.
[54:43.840 --> 54:44.840]  I'll take this one.
[54:44.840 --> 54:45.840]  Yoink.
[54:45.840 --> 54:52.420]  Can you imagine if they were just up there, like, like right next to the Apple cases,
[54:52.420 --> 54:55.640]  to the phone cases, there's just a bunch of watches you just pick up.
[54:55.640 --> 54:57.240]  You're sitting out there.
[54:57.240 --> 54:58.240]  Well, that's a, yeah.
[54:58.240 --> 54:59.240]  And that's the thing.
[54:59.240 --> 55:02.080]  I mean, they're, they're, they're redesigning the whole store experience, right?
[55:02.080 --> 55:05.840]  Well, that's, I mean, that's the thing that we don't, no one's really talked about that
[55:05.840 --> 55:07.720]  much from what I've seen.
[55:07.720 --> 55:10.900]  And we would probably be talking about like crazy if there weren't this other thing going
[55:10.900 --> 55:11.900]  on.
[55:11.900 --> 55:14.060]  Um, that is really the reason for that thing.
[55:14.060 --> 55:19.200]  But supposedly they're, they're really going to redo right.
[55:19.200 --> 55:22.600]  One of the store looks, one of the nuggets dropped in this article is that Johnny Ive
[55:22.600 --> 55:27.560]  is working with Angela Ahrendts on a, I think it said complete redesign of the stores.
[55:27.560 --> 55:29.560]  Yeah, I think so.
[55:29.560 --> 55:33.400]  Um, but that does not seem like something that's going to happen before April, at least
[55:33.400 --> 55:34.960]  not nationwide or worldwide.
[55:34.960 --> 55:35.960]  Yeah, right.
[55:35.960 --> 55:39.880]  And it's just like, that's, that's not the thing that you can just do in every store
[55:39.880 --> 55:40.880]  overnight.
[55:40.880 --> 55:41.880]  Right.
[55:41.880 --> 55:45.080]  So there's been, you know, speculation, but a lot of Apple stores like the one in Philadelphia
[55:45.080 --> 55:49.560]  has an upstairs that you don't, it's not part of the retail experience and they, they call
[55:49.560 --> 55:52.800]  it, now they call it a business center.
[55:52.800 --> 55:59.220]  And I know for a fact that like in the Philly one, they do things like, um, like if a company
[55:59.220 --> 56:03.920]  in Philadelphia buys a bunch of Apple stuff, you know, like switch, like an office that's
[56:03.920 --> 56:07.860]  switching from PCs to max, you don't have to buy retail.
[56:07.860 --> 56:08.860]  You can go there.
[56:08.860 --> 56:11.320]  Like Marco's often talked about this on ATP.
[56:11.320 --> 56:15.380]  You know, he, he, he does it and he's a one man company, but you start a business relationship
[56:15.380 --> 56:19.840]  with them and you can get like developer pricing, you know, like discount pricing.
[56:19.840 --> 56:22.920]  Well they used to have, and that used to be a whole separate arm.
[56:22.920 --> 56:23.920]  Right.
[56:23.920 --> 56:28.280]  Um, and then they did a reorganization six years ago, seven years ago, something like
[56:28.280 --> 56:29.280]  that.
[56:29.280 --> 56:33.240]  And they moved all that stuff under, um, the retail side.
[56:33.240 --> 56:36.280]  So like in the Philly one, you go upstairs and they have like area where they could do
[56:36.280 --> 56:37.280]  training.
[56:37.280 --> 56:38.280]  They can have everybody in your company.
[56:38.280 --> 56:40.900]  You can pay, you know, they'll, or I don't even know if you pay, you know, you, you,
[56:40.900 --> 56:44.780]  you buy like all these Macs and then you can have like a half a day of training and stuff
[56:44.780 --> 56:45.780]  like that.
[56:45.780 --> 56:49.500]  Um, and they have, you know, it's just like a meeting area cause like the day where the,
[56:49.500 --> 56:53.920]  when the Philly one opened, I got like a press invitation to just attend, to take a look
[56:53.920 --> 56:56.780]  and they gave us like a behind the scenes tour and we went up there.
[56:56.780 --> 57:00.300]  It's just, you know, like exactly what you would think if, if there was a conference
[57:00.300 --> 57:02.500]  room in an Apple store, that's what it looks like.
[57:02.500 --> 57:06.800]  It's a table that looks like one of their tables, but it's big and there's nice chairs
[57:06.800 --> 57:09.700]  and Apple style lighting and et cetera.
[57:09.700 --> 57:15.500]  But anyway, the stores that have that area, clearly that could be repurposed as a quiet
[57:15.500 --> 57:21.900]  removed, um, place where you spend $4,000 on a watch and try on, you know, multiple
[57:21.900 --> 57:24.900]  straps and stuff like that and see what you like, you know.
[57:24.900 --> 57:26.900]  Um, but not all stores have that.
[57:26.900 --> 57:32.540]  The ones in malls, shopping malls don't have the luxury of having like a second floor.
[57:32.540 --> 57:37.240]  So maybe, you know, it could be that maybe the, the addition model won't be sold in every
[57:37.240 --> 57:38.240]  Apple store.
[57:38.240 --> 57:40.740]  It could only be sold in certain ones.
[57:40.740 --> 57:41.860]  It might also be the case.
[57:41.860 --> 57:45.700]  I don't, I don't know if they would do it or not, but maybe they'll, maybe that's why
[57:45.700 --> 57:47.220]  they hired this Tag Heuer guy.
[57:47.220 --> 57:52.780]  Maybe they'll sell them in jewelry stores, you know, places that sell Rolexes and Amigas
[57:52.780 --> 57:55.340]  and you know, et cetera.
[57:55.340 --> 57:58.000]  I suppose that's possible.
[57:58.000 --> 57:59.460]  That seems odd.
[57:59.460 --> 58:00.500]  Yeah.
[58:00.500 --> 58:05.860]  But the whole idea of a $4,000, yeah, but then they're like, they're, they're removing
[58:05.860 --> 58:10.860]  the, you know, they're, they're giving that hands-on experience to somebody else, right?
[58:10.860 --> 58:14.460]  But it almost gets you, I mean, obviously they still, they still do that kind of thing,
[58:14.460 --> 58:18.820]  you know, because they sell their phones and carrier stores, et cetera.
[58:18.820 --> 58:24.940]  But um, that kind of personal touch seems like something they want to keep to themselves.
[58:24.940 --> 58:28.500]  Yeah, I guess you would think so, but I don't know.
[58:28.500 --> 58:29.500]  Yeah.
[58:29.500 --> 58:33.820]  Um, maybe, but maybe where they also also, you know, it's sort of like the way that I
[58:33.820 --> 58:37.140]  think that that's where they want you to buy your iPhone, but they'll also sell it in the
[58:37.140 --> 58:40.820]  carrier stores and they'll sell them at Walmart and they'll sell them at Target.
[58:40.820 --> 58:44.340]  But the problem with those places though, isn't as most of those people work on commission,
[58:44.340 --> 58:45.340]  don't they?
[58:45.340 --> 58:47.700]  At like Walmart or you mean?
[58:47.700 --> 58:48.700]  No, no, no.
[58:48.700 --> 58:49.840]  At the jewelry stores.
[58:49.840 --> 58:51.500]  I would presume so.
[58:51.500 --> 58:52.500]  Yeah.
[58:52.500 --> 58:53.860]  And I don't know that they're going to want to, I don't know.
[58:53.860 --> 58:56.180]  That seems like that's a whole nother diff.
[58:56.180 --> 59:01.220]  That's a whole different, like I said, I don't doing way of doing business that I would be
[59:01.220 --> 59:02.780]  surprised if they want to.
[59:02.780 --> 59:04.180]  Again, I don't know.
[59:04.180 --> 59:05.180]  I love it.
[59:05.180 --> 59:06.180]  I really don't know.
[59:06.180 --> 59:07.180]  I feel like it could go either way.
[59:07.180 --> 59:09.900]  I feel like they could sell them only in select Apple stores.
[59:09.900 --> 59:14.780]  I feel like they could sell them, you know, in the watch stores.
[59:14.780 --> 59:15.780]  I don't know.
[59:15.780 --> 59:16.780]  Yeah.
[59:16.780 --> 59:17.780]  Anyway, back to the article.
[59:17.780 --> 59:22.820]  It says, uh, in parts of the world already filled with smartphones, that price may give
[59:22.820 --> 59:29.740]  the Apple watch the graduation gift appeal that according to Brunner, Brunner is a industrial
[59:29.740 --> 59:34.960]  designer who used to be above Johnny I've I think at Apple when he started and had since
[59:34.960 --> 59:41.240]  gone on to beat beats consciously sought with its high headphone pricing, but I've solid
[59:41.240 --> 59:47.420]  gold models innocently named Apple watch edition are expected to cost many thousands of dollars.
[59:47.420 --> 59:53.060]  John Gruber and influential Apple blogger has written that the price may be quote shockingly
[59:53.060 --> 59:57.860]  high dot, dot, dot from the perspective of the tech industry, but perhaps disruptively
[59:57.860 --> 59:59.940]  low italics.
[59:59.940 --> 01:00:05.380]  They even carried my italics over from the perspective of the traditional watch and jewelry
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:06.380]  world.
[01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:07.380]  I like that.
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:09.900]  I got italics into the New Yorker.
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:10.900]  They're writers too.
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:11.900]  I don't know if they're allowed to use this.
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:12.900]  They don't use it much.
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:14.580]  No, not the way I do.
[01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:17.060]  So that's pretty cool.
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:20.740]  From the perspective of the traditional watch and jewelry world, I wish that he had quoted
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:26.700]  my line that it's that, that when the price of the edition models is announced, it's going
[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:31.660]  to be the biggest collective shit fit in the history of shit fits in the tech industry.
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:36.140]  Cause I just feel like I still feel confident that that's the line that will stand up, stand
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:39.180]  the test of time as being prescient about the Apple watch.
[01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:46.540]  Yeah, but this may, I mean that quote makes a point that is salient to what he's talking
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:47.540]  about right there.
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:48.540]  Right?
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:51.420]  Well, here's, here's why I've thought about this and I, you know, cause it's my name and
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:58.940]  my quote, it's very interesting to me because clearly Ian Parker had complete access to
[01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:01.380]  Johnny Ive and he talked to a bunch of other people at Apple.
[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:02.380]  He talked to Tim Cook.
[01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:08.580]  He talked to Bob Mansfield, talked to Jeff Williams and it was months in the making.
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:12.900]  It involved, I think he, it seems as though he traveled to England to talk to Johnny,
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:13.900]  Johnny's father.
[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:19.480]  You know, he just, this sort of thing that like the New Yorker is one of the few publications
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.940]  in the world that can do this because it's expensive, right?
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:27.220]  It's expensive to do this kind of reporting.
[01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:31.100]  He had access and he has all sorts of interesting quotes that you don't typically get from Apple
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:32.100]  executives.
[01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:39.000]  Surely he asked them about watch pricing and there's nothing in here that he doesn't say
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.260]  that he did, but he must've, right?
[01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:47.260]  And they must've said, no comment, we're not going to talk about pricing at the time, right?
[01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:50.700]  But maybe like, did he come up, did he quote me?
[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:57.140]  Because he, you know, he reads me or, or off the record, did they, was it, you remember
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:58.700]  with the Steve Jobs?
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:03.660]  We think John Gruber's piece on this was insightful and not negative.
[01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:07.980]  Like maybe they said off the record, you can't quote us, but we thought John Gruber's piece.
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:09.180]  But take a look at this one.
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:10.180]  Yeah.
[01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:11.180]  Yeah.
[01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:15.260]  We thought his piece on the pricing was insightful and not negative.
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:21.260]  I really wonder about that if, if that was something that they, they said, we can't talk
[01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:23.700]  about this, but you should look here.
[01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:28.100]  Yeah, that's certainly possible, right?
[01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:36.340]  That's the, to me, it's, it's the stupidest sort of like four levels of indirection confirmation.
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:45.180]  But the fact that he had such access to Apple and even he points to the addition watches
[01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:51.400]  being, you know, quote, many thousands of dollars is the, to me, the surest thing.
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.820]  It's more sure than even the sort of back of the envelope math I've been doing on Daring
[01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:59.540]  Fireball with just the price of gold and how much gold is actually going to be in the thing.
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:06.100]  More, even more convincing than that is that if Ian Parker, who's so juiced in, says multi,
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:13.560]  many thousands of dollars, it must be, I would bet on it, but I keep, I, then I just keep
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:17.660]  cycling back to what all the naysayers say, which is, come on, they can't charge thousands
[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:21.780]  of dollars for a watch that's going to be outdated in a couple of years.
[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:22.780]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:27.820]  It's the, it's the outdatedness that kind of throws a wrench into it because if it is
[01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:32.900]  the kind of thing that you're going to have to replace in two years, then that price becomes
[01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:37.260]  except somewhat untenable, right?
[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:42.860]  Well, but it's a, you and I are, we keep going back to thinking like logical human beings
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:50.420]  who have some semblance of, you know, rational control over our finances, where there's a
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:52.140]  lot of people who don't, right?
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:53.540]  Which is strange for us.
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:54.540]  Right.
[01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:55.540]  Right?
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:04:04.300]  Like in a weird perverted sense, if it, if it does have a time, you know, a, what's a,
[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:08.260]  you know, a timestamp, you know, a shelf life, if it does have a shelf life of just a few
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:13.260]  years, it almost makes it more of a luxury.
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:19.900]  It might be more ostentatious to buy a $10,000 Apple watch that's only going to be useful
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:25.820]  for three years than it would be to buy a $50,000 Rolex that will live, you know, be
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.900]  you, you know, be a value long after you're dead.
[01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:29.900]  Right?
[01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:37.020]  Like the $50,000 Rolex that becomes a family heirloom is still $50,000 watch, but a $10,000
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:42.140]  watch that is going to be going in the desk drawer in three years is super obnoxious.
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:43.140]  Right?
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:52.140]  That's what I had tweeted a few days ago, like a couple of weeks ago, I guess like Apple
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:58.740]  in 2010, Hey, check out this guy who made that I am rich app and then a, then a pause
[01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:01.500]  and we should make a watch like that.
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:05.580]  Oh my God.
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:07.220]  Like, like what a jerk.
[01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:13.180]  And then like, wait a minute, maybe there's something to that and the laughter just suddenly
[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:17.020]  just trails off uncomfortably.
[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:19.020]  Start buying gold.
[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:20.020]  Oh my God.
[01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:23.940]  Speaking of which, I hadn't thought about that guy in a while, but I hope he's making
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:26.100]  an iPhone app or a Apple watch.
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:34.500]  Oh, you know, he is, and then the, the article mentioned, you have an addition as well.
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:35.940]  No, I have an addition.
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:39.740]  And then you suddenly pull your sleeve back and you've got the, I am rich app on your
[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:40.740]  watch.
[01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:47.940]  Do you have one of these, do you have any gray Poupon?
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:50.660]  I'm trying to find the name.
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:54.700]  I can't remember the name of that horrible company that makes the really expensive phones.
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:55.820]  Oh, I know.
[01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:56.820]  Virtu.
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:57.820]  Virtu, Virtu.
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:58.820]  Yeah.
[01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:00.420]  And it mentions, it mentions Virtu in quotes.
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:09.940]  Somebody is saying like, once I guess I'm Bennett and I was saying that I think it was
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:14.940]  him that Johnny was very interested in that company.
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:15.940]  Yeah.
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:16.940]  Yeah.
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:18.800]  And I don't think it was because he liked their phones.
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:25.300]  I think, no, I think the interest is that he enjoyed people are buying them, right.
[01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:30.460]  And they're still, I really thought that they were going the way of the dodo once the iPhone
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:35.300]  came out, because the whole idea was that in a world full of crap phones, you could
[01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:40.780]  have the best phone because yours was made with leather and premium materials, even though
[01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:48.580]  it was running the same $15 Symbian, you know, chips on the interior as like a $30 Nokia
[01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:49.580]  phone.
[01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:50.580]  I mean, it's true.
[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:54.180]  I mean, it was used to, they've since, I mean, Nokia doesn't even exist or it doesn't sell
[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:55.660]  phones anymore.
[01:06:55.660 --> 01:07:01.060]  But when Virtu was created, they were just, it was like, they were to Nokia, what like
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:05.900]  Lexus is the Toyota or Acura is to Honda, they were like a, you know, premium luxury
[01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:07.540]  subsidiary brand.
[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:12.780]  But they just use the same, you know, like the way that like an Acura TL is, has like
[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:16.460]  the frame of like a Honda Accord.
[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:20.900]  It was, you know, like take the case apart, and it was exactly the same as certain, you
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:25.300]  know, each each Virtu phone corresponded to a corresponding Nokia phone.
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:30.620]  And they just put it in premium products and sold it for like, five, $6,000.
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:33.700]  And they did have the other thing that I guess that Virtu still has is they have like this
[01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:40.580]  concierge service, where you can, like, I guess what you do is they'll look things up
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:41.580]  for you on the internet.
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:42.580]  Yeah.
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:44.580]  Because your phone can't do it.
[01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:50.220]  It really does seem it sounds to me when I've read about it, that it really does the whole
[01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:55.540]  idea of the concierge predates the idea of apps.
[01:07:55.540 --> 01:08:01.620]  It's sort of like, you remember how everything in the Flintstones had like a biological component,
[01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:10.060]  you know, like, there was always like, like, like, they put something like, they put it
[01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:15.260]  in the microwave, the microwave was really like a turtle with a couple of matches who
[01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:19.780]  would create a fire, you know, underneath the food.
[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:23.780]  And yeah, that, you know, everything had like a thing that that's what the Virtu concierge
[01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:24.780]  service was.
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:28.580]  It's like, so like today, it's like, if you and I were like, hey, let's go get a steak,
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:33.820]  and we'd open open table and it would be like, bloop bloop table for two 830 tonight steak
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:37.460]  you instead you press this button on your Virtu phone and talk to somebody and be like,
[01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:42.780]  I need a table for two at, you know, Morton Steakhouse 830.
[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:44.180]  And then they do it.
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:49.020]  That just sounds terrible, really does.
[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:52.700]  But anyway, I thought that, you know, once the iPhone came out, and clearly you were
[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:56.380]  not getting the best phone in the world, you're, you know, the best right in the world was,
[01:08:56.380 --> 01:09:01.220]  you know, $600 that they would quickly go the way of the dodo, but they haven't they're
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.220]  still around.
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:03.220]  They outlasted.
[01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:04.220]  Nokia.
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:05.220]  Yeah.
[01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:14.460]  And that quote was from Clive Grinier, who was a friend of Ives, who said that, who is
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:19.100]  also said, he's always been a bit bling.
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:23.700]  Yeah, which is a little worrisome, because then you start to worry that maybe it was
[01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:26.820]  Steve Jobs who kind of kept the bling in check.
[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:31.060]  Yeah, I guess I don't know.
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:32.300]  Let me look it up.
[01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:35.500]  I have some notes from this article.
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.420]  The lines that really stuck out to me.
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:42.220]  Yeah, I mean, anything any article that quotes big bogg Mansfield is automatically he was
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:44.700]  so he was so comfortable.
[01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:47.380]  I thought Mansfield in this, at least he comes across it.
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:51.980]  Whereas Jeff Williams, this is my favorite line in the whole, whole article, I didn't
[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:56.500]  want to go through and just spoil it to for people on daring fireball is one of the I
[01:09:56.500 --> 01:10:01.980]  think it's so well written, to be truthful and insanely jealous that he got this access
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:06.700]  and that he took advantage of it and and, you know, came up with such a great article
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:09.260]  that to me is so accurate.
[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:14.500]  Where does it say here?
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:15.500]  Is it the pause?
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:16.500]  Yeah.
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:17.500]  Yeah.
[01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:21.020]  It's such a great sentence.
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:22.020]  All right.
[01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:26.980]  Here's is Ian Parker writing, I asked Jeff Williams, the senior vice president, if the
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:33.260]  Apple Watch seemed more purely Ives than previous company products.
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:43.700]  After a silence of 25 seconds, during which Apple made $50,000 in profit, he said, yes.
[01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:49.100]  That is that is such a it's two sentences, but it's the it's the best paragraph about
[01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:55.360]  Apple I've I've ever read, I think, because clearly, Jeff Williams, I mean, it's to my
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:58.740]  knowledge, he's never spoken to the press before.
[01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:08.220]  Clearly he is instant he's been at Apple very long time, you know, since I think late 90s.
[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:13.200]  And he's obviously not comfortable and rather than you know, an Apple people, you know,
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:16.700]  he knows enough that if he's not gonna be comfortable rather than Babylon, it'd be better
[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:17.700]  to just sit there.
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:18.700]  Say much.
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:19.700]  Yeah.
[01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:23.200]  Take a 25 second pause before saying yes.
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:30.580]  And that little aside during which Apple made $50,000 in profit, I think it's brilliant.
[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:33.100]  Because it to me, it's not snide.
[01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:37.540]  It's it's to me, no, it's no, it's a it's like filling the pause.
[01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:39.880]  Yeah, yeah, it fills the pause.
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:46.960]  And it also just reminds you of why this is of interest, why this company is of interest,
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:49.960]  why this company is worth this much attention.
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:53.620]  You know, it tells you the scale that they're operating at.
[01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:55.160]  Yeah.
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:12:00.980]  You know, it's, it's just a nice little reminder of scale like to fill in for, you know, like
[01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:02.780]  the Jeopardy theme song.
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:03.780]  Yeah.
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:07.140]  There's, there's a lot in the article.
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:08.240]  Yes.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.240]  That is pretentious.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.980]  I mean, that comes that can easily come across as pretentious.
[01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:15.500]  All right, example.
[01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:18.420]  Oh, well.
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:26.860]  You know, I've comments about other people's cars while he's driving around in this Bentley.
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:29.540]  Yeah, and what's his name, our good friend.
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:32.860]  And in the fact that I mean, you know, the simple fact that they're just they're crazy
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:33.860]  rich.
[01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:37.580]  I mean, you know, that all these, you know, most of these guys are filthy rich.
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:41.200]  And you know, he's got a, he's got a plane.
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:46.260]  He was buying living room houses in England, you know, that were built in the 1700s 17th
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:47.260]  century.
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:51.340]  And our good friend Dan Lyons jumped on this.
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:53.420]  Did you see?
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:54.940]  I did not.
[01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:55.940]  You did not see?
[01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:56.940]  I don't know.
[01:12:56.940 --> 01:13:01.740]  I don't think he I know, I mean, I've tried not to pay attention to him anymore.
[01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:02.740]  Really?
[01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:04.660]  I thought that I thought he was done.
[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:07.180]  Where is he writing now?
[01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:09.020]  He sounded belly wag, right?
[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:13.540]  Yeah, no, but I thought so because he wrote that he his his back was given him problems
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:16.420]  and he couldn't blog.
[01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:17.420]  And he's writing a book.
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:21.420]  And so like a month after he took over value, you cut your whole thumb off and you still
[01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:22.420]  blog.
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:23.420]  It's true.
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:30.460]  I gotta tell you, if if you have I mean, I you know what, I do not like the man professionally.
[01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:31.940]  I don't.
[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:34.160]  But I don't wish injury on anybody.
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:37.660]  And so I certainly hope in all sincerity, I do hope that that whatever's wrong with
[01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:40.220]  his back gets better quickly.
[01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:43.900]  I don't I don't wouldn't poke fun at that or any kind of medical problem.
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:50.560]  But I do have to say as somebody who who blogs professionally, I have to say if you have
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:55.820]  to have a job where you get a bad back injury, this might be the job to have.
[01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:57.620]  Like you could keep going.
[01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:04.300]  Yeah, yeah, I would say my Yeah, I would say my finger injury where I couldn't type.
[01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:09.380]  I would, I would have traded that for a back injury any any day of the week.
[01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:11.180]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:16.740]  Anyway, though, he wrote, he wrote a piece for Valley wag, the Apple design boss, john
[01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:20.740]  john, I've this is I swear, I think Dan Lyons is losing it.
[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:25.160]  I mean, you call him Jonathan, you can call him Johnny, who calls him john, nobody.
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:29.860]  And I as far as I know, in the history of the world, nobody's ever called him john.
[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:34.580]  john I've gets chauffeured to work in a Bentley.
[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:35.580]  This is crazy.
[01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:36.580]  This is his lead.
[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:38.260]  I mean, this is seriously crazy stuff.
[01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:43.100]  There is surprisingly little to be learned about Sir Jonathan I've in this 17,000 word
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:45.580]  piece in the New Yorker, except this.
[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:51.060]  The fucker gets driven to work in a Bentley Mulsanne, a car, quote, a car for a head of
[01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:53.520]  state as Ian Parker puts it.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:58.660]  How can you say there is surprisingly little to be learned about this guy?
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:01.060]  There's almost too much to cover.
[01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:03.020]  It's almost crazy.
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:07.780]  And that the one thing he takes amazing unprecedented access that one detail is back to Dan lines
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:09.060]  that one detail says it all.
[01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:12.420]  If you want to know who wields the real power at Apple, look no further.
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:17.780]  The Mulsanne starting price is a tick over $300,000 and can go higher.
[01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:21.700]  Like if you get the special grape hone refrigerator, I guess.
[01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:22.900]  But the price is not the point.
[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:24.740]  The point is the chauffeur.
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:26.180]  His name is gene.
[01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:30.040]  There's no word in the article about whether I've makes gene wear a uniform and if so whether
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:35.060]  I've designed the uniform himself and if so if he selected his driver by making a few
[01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:39.040]  dozen candidates line up and posed to see which one would look best in the uniform that
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:43.820]  I've designed and or which ones would agree to have plastic surgery to make themselves
[01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:47.820]  look just so in that uniform and hat.
[01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:49.180]  But you get the idea.
[01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:52.900]  John Ive is off the fucking rails and the only person who could rein them in is no longer
[01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:54.460]  among the living.
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:16:01.060]  So it's like, do you know how many people I know so many people who in who work in San
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:04.100]  Francisco who's part of their job get free Uber.
[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:07.900]  It's like the most it's like a super common perk nowadays.
[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:10.160]  It's because like driving sucks.
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:14.420]  So there's all it's like a super common perk as your job hump to get free Uber and you
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:18.980]  just you know, which is not quite the same as having your own personal chauffeur and
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:19.980]  a $300,000 car.
[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:20.980]  But guess what?
[01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:27.460]  John Ive is a billionaire like he owns you said he bought Steve Jobs private jet.
[01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:34.900]  So if you own a private jet, I think owning a $300,000 car is actually not not crazy at
[01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:35.900]  all.
[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:36.900]  Yeah.
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:37.900]  I mean, it makes sense.
[01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:39.180]  I mean, you know, like I think I earned the money.
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:41.500]  It makes sense for him to spend it the way he wants to spend it.
[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:46.500]  That's not really my I mean, I don't have apparently whatever lions this problem is.
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:57.820]  All right, but it's just that it's just the, you know, the incongruence between that and
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:01.380]  the wealth level of many of Apple's customers is a little can be a little bit odd.
[01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:07.380]  All right, now here's there's a kernel of truth and accuracy and in his article, the
[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:11.100]  next thing he says, you know how people say that no way would this have happened if Steve
[01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:12.580]  were alive and running Apple?
[01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:13.900]  Usually those people are full of shit.
[01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:15.680]  But this is one case where it's true.
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:20.940]  No way would Steve have allowed this article to happen while they're that that sentence
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:22.840]  I believe is completely true.
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:26.620]  No way this article happens if Steve Jobs is still running Apple.
[01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:30.540]  Although I'm not 100% sure whether that's because of Steve or whether that's because
[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:34.660]  of Katie, which we can cycle back to a second.
[01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:39.260]  No way would he have allowed one of his employees to be deified like this for that matter.
[01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:43.380]  No way would john I've have dared to ride around with a chauffeur when Steve was alive
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:47.300]  and no way would Steve have ever been so vulgar as to be driven around by a chauffeur and a
[01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:53.740]  Bentley like a normal or no like a modern day Pharaoh Steve drove his own Mercedes and
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:56.700]  parked in a handicapped space like a normal sociopath.
[01:17:56.700 --> 01:18:02.500]  Well, number one, Steve Jobs, that's, that's a funny line, Steve Jobs lived in Palo Alto.
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:04.340]  So he had like a 15 minute drive to work.
[01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:07.980]  Johnny Ive lives in San Francisco, which is a shitty drive.
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:10.940]  It's I've done it because I've stayed in San Francisco for Apple events.
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:15.860]  Oh, well over an hour and especially, you know, of course gets worse at, you know, like
[01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:21.180]  the sort of hour where you go to work, because that's what everybody else is doing to terribly
[01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:22.180]  it's a terrible drive.
[01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:26.380]  I mean, it like once or twice a year for me, it's no big deal as something that I would
[01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:31.220]  do five or six days a week, it would make you crazy.
[01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:36.040]  He's a billionaire, like one of the two things that came out of this that segment of it.
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:38.020]  One is that Parker doesn't mention anything about it.
[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:41.700]  And somebody brought this up on Twitter a while ago, but Apple, I don't know what the
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.060]  legal things are.
[01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:48.860]  But for some of their executives, they reveal in SEC filings, what their stock grants are,
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:49.860]  right?
[01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:53.900]  There was a thing with Angela aren'ts getting a huge one, you know, like, she got a was
[01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:58.460]  well more paid than Tim Cook last year, because it was like a one time, you know, here's a
[01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:03.740]  whole bunch of stock to tempt you to, you know, come from Burberry to Apple.
[01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:06.820]  But somebody pointed out that Johnny Ive has never been listed in there.
[01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:08.660]  Like nobody knows what Johnny Ive makes.
[01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:10.420]  Nobody knows how much Apple stock he has.
[01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:14.100]  It's, it's like super secretive.
[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:20.380]  But the article clearly, you know, Parker's article clearly insinuates that at one point,
[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:24.060]  Johnny Ive was thinking about leaving Apple, at least pondered it like when he bought like
[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:28.580]  you said the 11 bedroom mansion in England.
[01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:31.260]  You know, it's in Apple's business.
[01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:35.700]  I mean, whatever his compensation is, they're keeping it secret and presumably it is immense.
[01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:44.300]  And well, right, like, he, he might be so he might be the, you know, I would guess he's
[01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:46.980]  showing this some signs that it might be immense, right?
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:52.020]  I'm guessing that it's, you know, on par, probably closest only to, you know, Steve
[01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:59.860]  Jobs's compensation over the last 15 years, you know, but it's billions, I would guess.
[01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:03.780]  You know, which for a company don't understand, but I mean, I can't understand how they I
[01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:05.620]  mean, they have to file those things with the SEC.
[01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:06.620]  I don't know.
[01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:07.620]  I don't know.
[01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:08.620]  I don't know.
[01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:09.620]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:10.620]  Maybe they filed it a long time ago.
[01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:11.620]  I don't know.
[01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:13.460]  But here's a mission for listeners of the talk show.
[01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:19.780]  If anybody out there can figure out what Johnny Ive's compensation from Apple is and has been,
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:20.780]  let me know.
[01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:21.780]  But as far as I know, it's not.
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:24.740]  And I don't know, I don't think they have to do it for everybody.
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:29.620]  There might be like certain legally defined positions, like the chief operating officer
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:35.580]  and the CEO, who you have to file it for, but I don't think that's possible.
[01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:42.300]  Why would it be, you know, why would it be required to reveal the salary of him just
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:45.420]  because his title is senior vice president, right?
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:46.420]  I don't think it is.
[01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:47.420]  I don't.
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:51.780]  There's nothing magical about just being a senior vice president.
[01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:52.780]  It's just a word, right?
[01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:58.180]  They don't have to reveal the salaries of individual, you know, engineers and designers.
[01:20:58.180 --> 01:20:59.180]  Yeah.
[01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:01.580]  As far as I know, it's secret.
[01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:02.900]  And I presume immense.
[01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:07.460]  It just seems such a bizarre thing for people to get hung up on.
[01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:09.380]  Plus he was in a car accident a long time ago.
[01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:11.860]  I forget, was that in the article?
[01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:17.160]  But there was like a, Johnny Ive was in a bad car wreck like a long time ago, like driving
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:19.300]  a sports car across country.
[01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:23.180]  Didn't it say this?
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:27.420]  I don't remember that, actually, but I've been reading this for a while now, so it's
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:28.420]  possible.
[01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:29.420]  Yeah, maybe it's not in this article.
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:30.540]  It might not be in this article.
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:34.180]  But anyway, you know, it just seems, it's almost like the opposite where it seems like
[01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:37.860]  it's in Apple's interest to, you know, get him a professional driver.
[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:43.460]  Not that he's a bad driver, but, you know, he might like driving fast, right?
[01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:46.460]  Like me, right?
[01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:47.460]  You know what?
[01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:50.220]  He should get one of those automatic sticks.
[01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:51.220]  Stick that here.
[01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:52.220]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:54.660]  I don't know if you can afford it.
[01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:55.660]  Yeah.
[01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:59.020]  So if anybody knows Johnny Ive, they're very reasonably priced.
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:00.020]  I'm sure he can afford.
[01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:05.780]  But if anybody knows Johnny Ive, pass along the coupon code TALKSHOW so that he can save
[01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:10.140]  20 bucks on his automatic for his Bentley.
[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:13.900]  And get him a Squarespace, too.
[01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:17.860]  No, I was thinking about the whole, this article would not have happened if Steve Jobs was
[01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:21.900]  around, and I don't think there's any doubt that it wouldn't have.
[01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:26.220]  It's not just that Jobs selfishly wouldn't want to let the attention be on anybody else.
[01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:29.420]  He wouldn't have allowed an article like that about himself, either.
[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:31.140]  It just wasn't the right role.
[01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:40.700]  But I do wonder how much of that was Jobs' own choice, and how much of it came from Katie
[01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:46.180]  Cotton, who was at Apple before, you know, she was at Apple the whole time while Jobs
[01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:47.180]  came back.
[01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:52.340]  I think she was already there, and, you know, she was one of the ones who Jobs kept and,
[01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:56.340]  you know, obviously got very close to and followed her advice, you know, very closely.
[01:22:56.340 --> 01:23:01.860]  But I wonder whether she drove that no media policy more than even Jobs did.
[01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:05.520]  Because at least early in his career, Jobs maybe wasn't accessible, but he certainly
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:08.820]  was occasionally accessible.
[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:10.220]  Yeah.
[01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:13.140]  Don't know.
[01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:16.140]  But that's, it seems like that's a pretty good, there's a good chance that that's what
[01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:18.140]  the case is.
[01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:19.140]  Yeah.
[01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:28.900]  It's, to me, that the existence of this article is the biggest sign that Apple is in a new
[01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:38.300]  open, more open attitude, and that Apple PR under Steve Dowling is significantly different
[01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:40.220]  than Apple PR under Katie Cotton.
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:41.220]  Yeah.
[01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:47.660]  Yeah, I mean, one of the things that's noted is that, I mean, it seems like there are several
[01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:51.300]  people, well, I guess this is true for most of them, like you said, like Williams, but
[01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:57.500]  like the designers that they talk to in the design lab, neither of them had spoken to
[01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:58.500]  the press before.
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:23:59.500]  No.
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:00.500]  No.
[01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:04.540]  It's like they've been hermetically sealed for 15 years.
[01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:09.400]  It's not, their existence isn't secret because they show up as a team every couple years
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:13.060]  to pick up awards, you know, in black tie type things, and there's pictures and people
[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:14.060]  know who some of them are.
[01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:17.620]  But yeah, none of them have ever spoken to the press before, and here they spoke fairly
[01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:18.620]  openly.
[01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:19.620]  Yeah.
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:26.020]  You know, they even talked about a specific instance of, what was it, there was a woman,
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:31.940]  what was her name, who, what did she would, she had wanted to use what an orange brown
[01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:34.340]  for the interior of the box for the edition.
[01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:42.180]  And, and then even in hindsight, now she agrees, oh, that was a terrible, terrible idea.
[01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:45.620]  So that's, there's a, there's a plus that we know that we know from the article is that
[01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:49.060]  if you buy the edition, you'll get a cloth to clean it.
[01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:56.820]  Well, there's an extra thousand dollars right there, right?
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:24:58.300]  Sure.
[01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:05.220]  Akana, what's her name?
[01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:06.860]  Just some brown.
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:07.860]  Yeah.
[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:08.860]  Yeah.
[01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:10.340]  Apple doesn't use a lot of brown.
[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:13.260]  Here's one that I thought was interesting.
[01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:14.780]  This is Johnny Ive's team.
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:19.820]  Team members work 12 hours a day and can't discuss work with friends.
[01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:24.700]  Well, I knew they can't discuss their work, but 12 hours a day, man, that's crazy.
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:26.700]  Am I lazy?
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:30.020]  Yeah, apparently.
[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:32.540]  I mean, that seems, that seems nuts.
[01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:36.060]  12 hours a day all the time?
[01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:39.980]  I mean, you get to work at nine and you don't leave until 9 p.m.?
[01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:40.980]  Yeah.
[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:43.460]  Oh, man, that seems crazy.
[01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:44.460]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:45.460]  Yeah.
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:46.460]  When I worked in Japan, that's what I did.
[01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:49.380]  Man, salary man hours.
[01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:50.380]  That's right.
[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:57.300]  And then what, then they followed by 12 hours of boozing, right?
[01:25:57.300 --> 01:25:58.300]  So close.
[01:25:58.300 --> 01:25:59.300]  Suntory time.
[01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:00.300]  Some nights.
[01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:02.300]  Not every night, but some nights.
[01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:03.300]  Suntory time.
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:07.980]  Like a bell rings at nine o'clock at night, ding, ding, ding, Suntory time.
[01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:10.460]  All of a sudden, the ties are loose.
[01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:15.880]  And now we drink until we throw up on the train on the way home.
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:19.840]  Each product has a lead designer, but almost everyone contributes to every project and
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:20.940]  shares the credit.
[01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:22.320]  Who had this or that idea?
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:25.780]  The team.
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:28.900]  Team meetings are held in the kitchen two or three times a week, and I've encouraged
[01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:30.500]  his candor.
[01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:35.500]  We put the product, I know it's pronounced candor, we put the product out of everything
[01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:36.500]  else he said.
[01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:40.060]  Let's say we're talking about something that I've done that's ugly and ill-proportioned
[01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:43.660]  because, believe you me, I can pull some beauties out of the old hat.
[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:48.900]  It's fine, and we all do, and sometimes we do it repeatedly, and we have these seasons
[01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:49.900]  of doing it.
[01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:55.760]  And then designer Akana says, I had one last week, which one, he said, the packaging things,
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:56.760]  she said.
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:00.100]  That's true, I've said laughing, it was so bad.
[01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:05.340]  She had proposed that an ultra-suede cloth inside the box for a gold version of the Apple
[01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:07.020]  Watch should be an orangey-brown.
[01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:13.900]  I've had objected with comic hyperbole, comparing it to the carpeting in a dismal student apartment.
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:18.140]  In the same amused spirit, Akana then asked, so you don't like it?
[01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:21.740]  Oh, man, what else?
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:29.060]  Speaking of candor, there was an interesting anecdote, or just sort of like a perspective
[01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:39.780]  from Ive about Steve Jobs, about his brusqueness, or however you want to term it, was really
[01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:49.260]  more about trying to be open and direct rather than being cruel or hurtful.
[01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:58.920]  And yeah, sorry if it does hurt your feelings, but Ive's thought on what Jobs' intent has
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:07.740]  been, was always to make himself clear, as opposed to really trying to stick a knife
[01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:09.740]  in somebody.
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:15.140]  Yeah, it wasn't about trying to hurt people's feelings, he wasn't Chevy Chase.
[01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:20.700]  And he often hurt people's feelings, but...
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:24.420]  It was simply because he didn't want to waste their time by not getting right to the heart
[01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:25.420]  of...
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:26.420]  Yeah, right.
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:31.140]  It was, he considered it unfair to them and a waste of their time.
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:32.140]  Right.
[01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:33.140]  Yeah, I thought that was pretty interesting.
[01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:40.860]  One of the other people who Parker clearly had significant access to was Steve Jobs'
[01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:43.580]  wife, Laurene Powell Jobs.
[01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:53.540]  And I think it backs up what everybody has said, that Johnny and Steve were more than
[01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:54.540]  just colleagues.
[01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:59.340]  They were really, really close friends, because she clearly knows him very well.
[01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:00.340]  Yeah.
[01:29:00.340 --> 01:29:05.460]  And he was there the day that he died.
[01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:07.860]  Yeah, that's what they said, yeah.
[01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:08.940]  Even if Jobs had rescued...
[01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:12.540]  This is following up on your thing about how Jobs had, you know, sort of criticized the
[01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:15.500]  way Johnny Ives gave criticism by being too gentle.
[01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:20.640]  Even if Jobs had rescued him from vagueness, it was odd for Ive to bring this up now immediately
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:26.180]  after I'd learned how to reject a color without causing injury.
[01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:30.740]  Here's a quote from Laurene Powell Jobs, "'I've seen Johnny deeply frustrated, but I've never
[01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:36.180]  seen him rant and rave,' Laurene Powell Jobs said, and she added, laughing, that she would
[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:41.460]  not have said the same of her husband.
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:46.940]  And it's hard to imagine Ives using a disabled parking spot, as Jobs often did, long before
[01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:47.940]  he was unwell."
[01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:50.660]  Oh, man.
[01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:51.660]  What a great article.
[01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:52.660]  So many...
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:53.660]  So much great stuff.
[01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:55.180]  Let me see what else I've got in here on it.
[01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:56.180]  It serves as a breakfast.
[01:29:56.180 --> 01:29:57.180]  He also...
[01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:01.540]  He did say, you know, about the Isaacson book.
[01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:02.540]  Oh!
[01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:04.380]  My regard couldn't be any lower.
[01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:07.020]  Yeah, that he read parts of it, and...
[01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:09.320]  Because I do think that's part of it, honestly.
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:10.320]  And it's...
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:11.860]  You know, there were some people...
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:17.900]  When I wrote my piece on the Isaacson book, which was as scathing as I could get, I got
[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:18.900]  some of the...
[01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:22.940]  You get every kind of feedback, but some of the feedback was of, sounds like sour grapes
[01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:25.280]  to me.
[01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:26.940]  And that's not the case at all, right?
[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:27.940]  It's like...
[01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:28.940]  There was no chance.
[01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:35.140]  There's 0.0000 all the way out, zero chance that I was going to be selected to write Steve
[01:30:35.140 --> 01:30:36.420]  Jobs's authorized biography.
[01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:37.420]  I'm not a biographer, right?
[01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:38.420]  I mean, I don't write...
[01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:41.900]  I've never even written a book.
[01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:46.820]  You know, what I've loved to have written a feature article about him, gotten some kind
[01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:51.980]  of on the record, spend a day with Steve Jobs, would have loved it, would have been amazing,
[01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:55.580]  would have been maybe the highlight of my career.
[01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:59.500]  But I didn't trash the book because I didn't write it or because I was jealous.
[01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:04.260]  I trashed it because it was terrible, I thought, especially about his professional life.
[01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:10.740]  And I couldn't be more effusively praiseful of this Ian Parker, New Yorker story because
[01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:19.900]  I think he's totally nailed a part of Apple that has been largely secret.
[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:21.700]  Let's just take the third break before we...
[01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:22.700]  We'll go back to the article.
[01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:25.900]  There was more to talk about, but let me talk about our third sponsor.
[01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:31.420]  And it's another longtime good friend of the show, our buddies at Fracture.
[01:31:31.420 --> 01:31:32.900]  You guys know Fracture.
[01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:37.520]  They're the place that prints your photos directly on glass.
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:44.060]  You send them digital photos, you pick a size, they mail you back a cardboard thing that
[01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:49.440]  you unpack the cardboard and it is a little frame, you can hang it on the wall.
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:53.900]  It's a thing you can pop a little thing out the back, a little kickstand, pop it on your
[01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:57.180]  desk or a shelf or a mantle.
[01:31:57.180 --> 01:32:02.460]  And the glass, piece of glass where the photo is, your photo is right on the glass.
[01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:05.700]  There's not like a piece of paper behind glass, it's right there.
[01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:07.780]  You don't have to go out and buy a frame to put this thing in.
[01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:09.820]  You don't have to go out and buy a stand to put it on.
[01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:13.820]  All comes right in the packaging and it's just edge to edge.
[01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:15.980]  Looks impossible because there's no other way to do that.
[01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:19.620]  So you have these photos, you can have these photos hanging on your wall with no visible
[01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:24.180]  frame around them, just the photo, edge to edge to edge.
[01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:25.180]  And it looks amazing.
[01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:27.020]  It is like the most amazing thing.
[01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:31.120]  And there's no way you could have done this with traditional framing of a piece of picture
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:32.120]  behind the frame.
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:33.120]  There's just no way you could do it.
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:34.120]  It looks amazing.
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:36.900]  People will come in and they'll be like, how do you, how did you do that?
[01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:39.620]  And then you'll have to tell them you have to do the same thing I'm doing now and tell
[01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:42.380]  them all about fracture.
[01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:45.760]  All sorts of sizes, great prices.
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:46.760]  It's super great.
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:50.160]  I don't even know how they charge as little as they do for these things.
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:51.160]  Great prices.
[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:54.820]  You can just keep going back every time you take good pictures, every time you go on vacation
[01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:59.820]  or something like that, send a couple pictures to fracture and get them hang them on a wall.
[01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:06.780]  It's such a great way to enjoy the best photos that you take.
[01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:08.160]  Where do you go to find out more?
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:15.560]  Their website is fracture me, fr a c t u r e me.com.
[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:24.840]  Just go there and use the code during fireball and you'll save 15%.
[01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:26.800]  So they're already prices already low.
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:29.780]  Use that code during fireball, you'll save 15% or even lower.
[01:33:29.780 --> 01:33:33.600]  So go there now, send them two or three of your favorite pictures that you've taken in
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.300]  the last year.
[01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:40.000]  And you'll thank me for my thanks to fracture for supporting the show.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  Yeah.
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.600]  And they have a, I have a customer service experience with them, which was fantastic
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:51.440]  because last father's day, I got a picture for my dad, which was in black and white.
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:54.800]  It was a picture of my grandfather that I had taken like in like years and years and
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:55.800]  years ago.
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:58.360]  Cause you have to go back that far from, I have to go back that far to find a good picture
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:33:59.840]  that I've taken.
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:04.520]  And I, but it was black and white and I wanted, you know, I wanted to get it on fracture and
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:07.520]  I hadn't, and I went to their site and I was having trouble finding anything that was in
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:08.520]  black and white.
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:11.480]  And I wanted to make sure they could do black and white and that it would look good.
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:16.100]  And you know, they got, the woman got right back to me and she said, actually here are
[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:17.840]  some on the site.
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:22.680]  And she pointed me to where I could see those and said, you know, don't worry, looks great.
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:24.040]  And my dad just loved it.
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:27.200]  It's really, so definitely a good company.
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:28.520]  Good people.
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:29.520]  Yeah.
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:30.520]  Yeah.
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:32.540]  It was a great phrase.
[01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:36.240]  One of my notes is this, I think it's so astute, it has nothing to do with Johnny.
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:40.120]  I was about Steve Jobs, but he's talking about how Johnny doesn't speak in public, doesn't
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:46.900]  have to speak in public, just isn't comfortable, but he does the videos, appears in those videos.
[01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:51.440]  Such videos used to punctuate Jobs' on stage message.
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:54.580]  In the absence of Jobs, they carry the message.
[01:34:54.580 --> 01:35:00.000]  People's current leaders aren't without public speaking skills, but they can't match Jobs'
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.680]  charisma, which was fortified by a hint of menace.
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:05.200]  I love that phrase.
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:14.920]  Like there was, that is sort of, a hint of menace is absolutely part of Steve Jobs' on
[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:17.600]  stage charisma.
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:20.240]  It was, it's absolutely true.
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:24.600]  And their performances can evoke the awkward informality, the dancing and lanyards of a
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:25.600]  corporate retreat.
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:34.480]  It's a little bit of a zinger there towards, I don't know, Schiller and Federighi, I guess.
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:37.960]  Yeah, I guess.
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:39.980]  Sort of the humor maybe, I don't know.
[01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:42.940]  But I love that hint of menace about Jobs.
[01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:46.760]  Such a great, such an astute turn of phrase to describe that.
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:52.000]  There's a long, there's a lot of talk about the digital, about the crown.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.800]  Oh, definitely.
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:58.640]  And how they kind of came up with that.
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:06.360]  And you brought this issue up the other day, I think that most of the other smartwatches
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:07.640]  have not had that.
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:11.920]  They've all relied on touch input on the screen, right?
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:12.920]  Yes.
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:13.920]  Yeah.
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:14.920]  Yeah.
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:17.080]  And that's something I hadn't really noticed.
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:24.200]  Yeah, and there's a bunch of them have a button at the traditional crown position.
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:25.200]  But it's just a button.
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:28.080]  It's like a thing you use to wake the phone or to activate something.
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:29.580]  It's not something you twist.
[01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:34.760]  Like the Apple One, you'll be, there's no way to use the watch without spinning the
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:35.760]  crown repeatedly.
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:38.880]  And I'm telling you, I've said this before, I'll say it again, once these things come
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:42.040]  out and everybody can try one, it's going to be, there's going to be like an entire
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:46.000]  week of people talking about how it feels to turn that crown.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.280]  Because it's the word lugubrious.
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:55.080]  Did you see Dan Morin's piece on six colors about the color?
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:56.080]  Yeah, I even linked to it.
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:57.080]  Inside the crown?
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:58.080]  Yeah, I linked to that.
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:36:59.080]  Yeah, that's a curiosity.
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:01.000]  That's another like head scratcher.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.880]  We talked about it on our podcast and it was very, very weird.
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:07.320]  I mean, when he pointed that out, I was like, Oh my God, what the heck is going on there?
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:08.320]  Right.
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:12.880]  So many shots, so many shots show it with a color that matches the band.
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:16.420]  I can confirm that the ones at the hands-on all were like that.
[01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:23.360]  So if you buy like the edition model with a red leather strap has a red matching red
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:27.620]  insert in the flat part of the digital crown.
[01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:33.240]  And if you buy the edition with a white band, it has a white insert.
[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:37.760]  But the thing that makes it so confounding is that they also talk about how easy it is
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:41.600]  to take the bands on and off, which makes you insulating, Oh, well then it's, you know,
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:42.600]  they're going to make money.
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:43.600]  It's not going to match anymore.
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:44.600]  Right.
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:47.340]  You're going to, you know, buy, you know, people with money to burn are going to buy
[01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:51.440]  multiple bands and you know, what else is the point of making it so easy to swap them?
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:56.580]  But then the digital insert won't match them, which seems curious, like why not just make
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:57.580]  it a neutral color?
[01:37:57.580 --> 01:37:59.800]  Why not just keep it, you know, gold?
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:00.800]  Yeah.
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:03.120]  And the, the sport watch is neutral.
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:05.320]  It's just the color of the body.
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:06.320]  Is it?
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:10.680]  Yeah, and the same, and the same with the, with the stainless stainless one.
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:11.680]  Yeah.
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:12.680]  So it's just the addition.
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:13.680]  Yeah.
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:16.880]  And it just seemed, and it, I don't know, it just seems weird.
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:17.880]  I don't know.
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:20.400]  And there's people on Twitter who are saying, well, maybe you pop those things out too and
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:21.400]  you can pop them in.
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:23.680]  But that seems like that seems finicky.
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:25.320]  I don't know.
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:26.320]  Yeah.
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:33.120]  Uh, her name was Jodi Akana, J O D Y Akana who is in her thirties and that she, this
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:37.320]  is, see, this is the sort of detail that Apple never would have revealed before.
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:44.040]  She's in Johnny's Ives group and she's unusual B for having a declared specialty color.
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:45.040]  Yeah.
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:46.040]  Crazy.
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:52.280]  Like all she does is pick colors.
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:56.840]  That's sort of like our future role where we're all we're going to do is pick fake Apple
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:04.920]  rumor projects.
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:05.920]  We'll have a great lab.
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:06.920]  Oh my God.
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:07.920]  It'd be so great.
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:11.200]  We'll have like, we'll get one of those jet packs like Connery used in thunderball.
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:12.200]  Right.
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:15.880]  See if we can get people to say that we're working on a, on a
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:21.600]  Ours will be more, ours will be more of a bar than a lab.
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:23.240]  It'll just be a bar.
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:24.240]  Let's face it.
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:25.240]  Yeah, right.
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:32.060]  Oh, we can't, we can't let this pass.
[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:38.200]  And I've once sat next to JJ Abrams at a boozy dinner party in New York and made what Abrams
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:46.160]  recalled as quote, very specific suggestions about the design of lightsabers.
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:50.480]  Abrams told me that Star Wars, The Force Awakens would reflect those thoughts, but he wouldn't
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:51.980]  say how.
[01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:56.120]  After the release of the film's first trailer, which featured a fiery new lightsaber with
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:40:01.700]  a cross guard and a resemblance to a burning crucifix, I asked I've about his contribution.
[01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:06.720]  It was just a conversation he said, then explained that although he'd said nothing about cross
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:10.120]  guards, he had made a case for unevenness.
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:13.880]  I thought it would be interesting if it were a little less precise and just a little bit
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:16.200]  more spitty.
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:22.280]  A redesigned weapon could be more analog and more primitive and I think in that way somehow
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:24.880]  more ominous.
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:25.880]  That's brilliant.
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:26.880]  Yeah.
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:27.880]  Absolutely.
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:32.560]  I mean, it sounds like, you know, it almost makes me, I mean, I don't like wondering how
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:37.120]  self-serving it is, but it sounds like everything that you like about that lightsaber, everything
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:43.960]  that at least most people seem to like about that lightsaber is what Johnny said, not the
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:47.560]  cross guard, which most people don't seem to like, I'm not bothered by it.
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:50.320]  I'm not bothered by it either, but you know, right.
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:56.920]  A lot of people are spitty dance a little bit more spitty and it would make it, you
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:41:02.160]  know, less digital, more analog would make it more ominous is, is so totally true.
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:04.760]  And it's so precise, right?
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:11.560]  Like clearly I think part of his gift is that he's able to communicate his feelings so well,
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:14.480]  you know, spitty is such a great word for that.
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:15.480]  I know it's great.
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:18.280]  So great, truly great.
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:22.800]  Another thing that came out of this was that the video that unveiled the watch that Johnny
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:27.960]  Ive narrates, that he directed it effectively, I mean, I'm sure not single-handedly, but
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:34.120]  that it was, you know, that he had a, you know, huge, you know, with Parker there, that
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:38.920]  he spent a lot of time in the room editing the video.
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:40.320]  It was pretty good.
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:41.320]  Yeah.
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:45.680]  Just, it's not something I would have expected that Johnny Ive had a direct hand in.
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:49.600]  Multi-handed.
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:52.480]  I mentioned on the article, the thing I took away from when I linked to it, the one thing
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:56.360]  I did mention is that it does seem, the article does make it seem like Johnny Ive is spread
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:00.180]  very thin because he's obviously in charge of all Apple products.
[01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:04.600]  One of the products are coming out with the Apple watch is their first major new product
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:07.000]  in the post jobs era.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.280]  And Johnny Ive is clearly feeling the pressure on that.
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:13.520]  The article makes clear, I mean, I, you know, who would have thought otherwise, I mean,
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:17.760]  it'd be worrisome if it were anything, if he was like nonchalant about it, but it's
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:19.720]  a lot on his shoulders.
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:25.480]  He's working with Angela Arntz on a redesign of all the Apple stores.
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:33.120]  And he's like the point person leading the directing the assembly of the new Apple headquarters.
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:36.400]  I was gonna say construction, but they even make a point that the way that they're putting
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:39.200]  it together is more assembly than construction.
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:46.880]  So he's got, he's got a worldwide headquarters, you know, presumably their headquarters for
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:51.080]  the next 50 years, a landmark building.
[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:52.920]  He's got all the Apple stores.
[01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:58.280]  He's got the watch and all the other products that they have seems and he's taken over software
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:42:59.280]  design.
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:00.280]  But he works 12 hours.
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:01.280]  He works 12 hours a day, John.
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:03.800]  Well, they don't say Johnny works 12 hours a day.
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:06.960]  I bet he works a lot more than that.
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:09.960]  It seems as though he must work more than 12 hours a day.
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:10.960]  Yeah.
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:14.720]  Like, I don't know that the whole team needs to work 12 hours a day, but yeah, it just
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:18.640]  seems like all those, all those executives are just, I mean, they're basically, I'm sure
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:23.280]  they take time off for their families, but I mean, they're kind of, they're kind of on
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:24.280]  all the time.
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:25.280]  Yeah.
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:29.440]  No, I think they all have a lot on their plate and it does, you know, I don't, I have no
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:33.680]  doubt that all of them are just naturally hardworking.
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:34.680]  Yeah.
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:41.760]  It makes a few passing remarks about how, you know, he's not always right.
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:42.760]  Yeah.
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:54.160]  And I don't, I mean, it doesn't, doesn't mention the newsstand icon specifically, but you know,
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:55.160]  things like that.
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:59.400]  They did bring up, Parker did bring up the hockey puck mouse, which is something many
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:01.600]  people always go back to.
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:07.040]  And I always have to mention, I always have to mention that, uh, my wife loved that mouse
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:08.040]  loved it.
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:11.500]  She used it years after her purple iMac had bit the dust.
[01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:15.880]  She was still using the purple hockey puck mouse with whatever computer she had next.
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:18.280]  So there are people who liked that mouse.
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:20.160]  I mean, my wife has relatively small hands.
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:21.520]  That might be why I don't know.
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:26.800]  I thought I had never met one, but I guess I have a hockey puck mouse like her.
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:29.080]  Yeah.
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:32.480]  I had a pla- I mean, I had, I got one of those plastic things that you clipped on it just
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:35.200]  to make it feel like a regular mouse.
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:37.000]  Why didn't you just buy a new mouse?
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.000]  I don't know.
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  I was an idiot.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000]  It was cheaper.
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.640]  It was cheaper than buying a new mouse, you know, it was like, oh, it was a couple bucks
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:44.760]  or something.
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:46.240]  It's like the mouse part worked fine.
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:49.680]  It was just the fact that I could never tell, you know, like just reaching out blindly and
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:52.760]  grabbing it, you could never tell which way it was pointed.
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:58.760]  You have to fiddle with it to get it to be oriented the right way.
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:44:59.760]  Here's Bob Mansfield.
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:04.280]  And this, to me, again, this is insight into the company that to me is unprecedented.
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:07.680]  And it just drops out in the middle of random paragraph in the middle of the article.
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:12.440]  Bob Mansfield, then closely involved in the watch product project.
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:13.760]  And number one, did we know that before?
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:17.120]  Did we know that Bob Mansfield was his special project?
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:21.840]  Well, no, I mean, no, I mean, I think you could, you could guess that, but I don't think
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:23.800]  it was ever stated explicitly anywhere.
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:32.040]  He said that Ives' role was to be, quote, himself and Steve, end quote, combined.
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:36.440]  Yet Ives still had to make a case to Apple.
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:40.640]  And that's another way, I have to think, that Johnny Ive is spread thin.
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:44.720]  In addition to just listing all the projects he's working on, it's explicitly stated here
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:50.560]  by Bob Mansfield that his, he sees his new role is to be what used to be Steve and Johnny,
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:54.400]  two geniuses, is the one, right?
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:59.480]  It's like, you know, it's like if the Beatles got back together and Paul had to be John
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:00.480]  and Paul, right?
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:03.520]  I mean, it's more, but I'm not even making a joke.
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:10.320]  I mean, wouldn't you feel, if you've personally felt that it was your job to be Steve Jobs,
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:15.520]  in addition to everything you yourself had already done, I mean, that's a burden.
[01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:22.480]  I mean, that is a serious, serious weight on your psyche.
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:29.240]  It wasn't that he met, this is about whether or not they should do a watch, in that Mansfield
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:31.500]  recalled quote, a lot of resistance.
[01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:35.400]  It wasn't clear how the company would display such things in stores.
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:40.020]  There were also concerns about creating a divide between wealthy and less wealthy customers.
[01:46:40.020 --> 01:46:44.340]  As Mansfield said, Apple wants to build products for everybody.
[01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:48.520]  But I've won the argument and in 2013, the company announced the high level appointments
[01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:54.880]  of Angela Ahrendts, blah, blah, blah, and the other luxury people.
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:47:00.160]  You know, I don't think, I think that's sort of, that's exactly what I, my vague second
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:04.760]  third hand understanding of the story behind the watches and the story of Johnny Ives role
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:06.400]  in the post-Jobs Apple.
[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:10.800]  But here's, you know, Bob Mansfield confirming it on the record in the New Yorker, you know,
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:15.880]  that they're, you know, and exactly what everybody thinks, like just, you know, Apple fans clucking
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:20.860]  on Twitter, you know, that isn't it weird that Apple is making this product that is
[01:47:20.860 --> 01:47:27.240]  so crazy differentiated, you know, by a factor of 10 in price between the 350 sport and the
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:33.080]  multi-thousand dollar thing and that there were people in Apple who it would, you know,
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:37.040]  at the high level within Apple, like decision making level with an Apple who obviously said
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:39.960]  the same things and had the same concerns.
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:41.760]  And they're, I don't think they're wrong.
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:43.440]  I think those are valid concerns.
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:47.100]  I don't think they're wrong to do it, but it is something that you should be concerned
[01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:48.100]  about.
[01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:49.100]  Yeah.
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:52.480]  Well, it's something to keep an eye on, you know, and it's, it's in a sense, you know,
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:58.400]  and, and, you know, I, it would have fallen on a Johnny Ive shoulders no matter what the
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:03.560]  success or if it's not a success of Apple watch is going to fall on his shoulders anyway.
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:07.860]  But with this article, it's, there's no ifs, ands, or buts about it, right?
[01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:13.440]  The article, I mean, almost expressly just says the watch is Johnny Ive's thing.
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:18.480]  Well the, certainly, certainly the luxury aspect of it.
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:19.960]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:21.240]  I've heard that too.
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:25.560]  That's like, that's just, I don't know, third hand, fourth hand, but I have heard that very
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:32.040]  specifically the gold thing met a lot of resistance within Apple and that like from all sorts
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:33.640]  of places, you know?
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:39.480]  Because like even like the legal department had to get involved in, you know, you know,
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:43.760]  you can't call it 18 karat gold unless it's truly 18 karat gold and, you know, it's all
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:48.920]  sorts of, you know, there's, it was a huge, huge thing within Apple and it was Johnny,
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:55.340]  you know, said, trust me more or less.
[01:48:55.340 --> 01:48:57.120]  You know who's not mentioned in here at all?
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:48:59.320]  Who is not mentioned in here at all?
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:00.320]  Scott Forstall.
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:02.320]  No, not mentioned at all.
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:03.320]  Yeah.
[01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:07.240]  I think obliquely mentioned a couple of times.
[01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:08.240]  Yeah.
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:13.160]  And I think there's a couple references to like, and I think Mansfield makes, makes some
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:20.880]  reference to how he, Johnny could get along with other people better than he could.
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:21.880]  Yeah.
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:24.960]  Well, no, that he ran interference with Steve, right?
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:25.960]  Isn't that what Mansfield said?
[01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:26.960]  Yeah.
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:27.960]  Yeah.
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:35.720]  He said, like, people who are, you know, kind of more brusque.
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:36.960]  Yeah, here we go.
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:37.960]  So
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:43.440]  is
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:48.140]  Bob Mansfield, a former senior hardware engineer at Apple, who is now semi retired recently
[01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:55.460]  described the peak that some colleagues that p i q u e, that some colleagues felt about
[01:49:55.460 --> 01:50:01.100]  Ives privileged access, as he put it, quote, there's always some always going to be someone
[01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:03.940]  vying for dad's attention.
[01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:09.380]  But Mansfield was grateful for Ives cool handling of a CEO who was, quote, not the easiest guy
[01:50:09.380 --> 01:50:15.480]  to please Mansfield view was Johnny puts up with a lot and as a result of him doing it,
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:17.600]  people like me don't have to.
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:20.860]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:26.000]  You get the feeling that that would with forced all personality wise, and again, you know,
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.240]  I think there's a personality more than anything else.
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:32.080]  I don't think you know, I think it was more than whether you think that that game center
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:35.440]  should have a felt background or, you know, oh, plain one.
[01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:36.440]  It's the personality.
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:40.240]  And I've, you know, was it Mansfield who the word was that Mansfield was like, I'm not
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:41.920]  I'm not taking a meeting with this guy anymore.
[01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:44.080]  Like, yeah, that's what I thought.
[01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:45.080]  Yeah.
[01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:46.080]  Yeah.
[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:48.760]  Or like, he wouldn't take a meeting with him unless like jobs was Yeah, and I thought that
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:52.080]  was one of the reasons why he had basically announced his retirement and then decided
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:56.080]  to come back or cook or like limited like he won't he won't be in a room with Scott
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:00.040]  forced all unless Cook was in the room and cook was like, I can't you know, I cannot
[01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:01.040]  have this.
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:02.040]  You know?
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:03.040]  Yeah.
[01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:06.120]  Tim Cook might have some stuff to do.
[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:07.120]  He might be busy.
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:16.380]  Tim Cook might work 12 hours a day to 12 Tim Cook might work 12 hours a morning.
[01:51:16.380 --> 01:51:22.000]  There was a great quote from there's a guy needs a watch.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:26.200]  There was a great quote here from Cook, which to me shows I think it's one of the loosest
[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:32.200]  quotes I've ever heard from Tim Cook because Tim Cook is he's like a machine with talking
[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:33.200]  points.
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:36.820]  You know, I he I think he's always very honest.
[01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:37.820]  I really do.
[01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:40.600]  I think he's very honest and very sincere.
[01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:46.000]  But it's so hard to see him in an interview and not see that everything he said he's already
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.000]  anticipated.
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:50.800]  You know, the Charlie Rose interview is the closest because it was the longest.
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:55.480]  But he says here in the New Yorker story under Cook, Apple has experimented with a softer
[01:51:55.480 --> 01:52:00.760]  less neurotic image and has among other things strive to improve its performance as a proxy
[01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:03.200]  employer of overseas factory workers.
[01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:08.520]  It's determined to make the case as Cook puts it, that the company's leaders shouldn't be
[01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:14.440]  thought of as quote, greedy bastards looking for more money.
[01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:21.160]  And then in reference to to the the new campus, Parker points out a private walled garden
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:27.140]  costing an estimated $5 billion may not catch this mood.
[01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:31.260]  But I do think I think that's such a loose quote from Cook and I think he truly means
[01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:35.360]  it but it's like, you know, I think in Tim Cook's world, bastards is a really that's
[01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:37.360]  a hard word.
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:40.920]  Yeah, I don't.
[01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:45.360]  He drops a I think he drops an F bomb in there someplace to cook.
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:46.360]  I thought so.
[01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:48.360]  I don't think so.
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:49.360]  Really?
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:51.560]  No, don't.
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:52.560]  Grinier says it.
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:56.220]  No, there's only after Okay.
[01:52:56.220 --> 01:52:58.040]  And when he first Yeah, no, I guess not.
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:01.560]  I guess Johnny I've when he first met the first time he met Steve Jobs when he visited
[01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:07.280]  the design studio and saw that they had cool stuff, but that they hadn't been able to ship
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:08.280]  it.
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:10.960]  I told Johnny I've fuck you've not been very effective.
[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:17.100]  Have you?
[01:53:17.100 --> 01:53:20.500]  What a great article honest to God everybody out there if you have not read this article
[01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:25.120]  yet you are out of your minds because if you have enough interest in Apple to listen to
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:28.840]  this podcast, this article is so right up your alley.
[01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:32.280]  I'm going to just assume that everybody Yeah,
[01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:37.520]  yeah, I mean the thing is like one of the things
[01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:43.240]  you could it can come across snooty or it can come across classes or it can come across
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:46.280]  elitist or however you want to put it.
[01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:52.880]  But the thing that definitely shines through is simply how much he cares about design and
[01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:55.560]  how much he cares about what he's doing there.
[01:53:55.560 --> 01:54:04.640]  Yeah, and I think and you know, I think the watch is a sign of that that and cook has
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:05.840]  alluded to this.
[01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:14.920]  I think cook has alluded to it very broadly, but that Apple is is about not about making
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:16.240]  computers.
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:21.400]  It's about making good things that make people's lives better.
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:25.600]  And that could be anything in the long run like in terms of and I think just like Tim
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:26.600]  Cook.
[01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:30.240]  I think Johnny I've and and I you know, as I've written about Steve Jobs, you know that
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:35.840]  his greatest creation was the company Apple itself know not one of the products that is
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:41.460]  an institution, you know, it's the future who knows what they'll be making, you know,
[01:54:41.460 --> 01:54:48.720]  but that that that he cares very deeply about creating a you know, a system and a pattern
[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:52.920]  that they can get involved in, you know, who knows what in the future.
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:54.480]  Yeah.
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:55:02.640]  And it contrasts with is it I thought was Brunner Brunner soon after the iPhone debuted
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:07.040]  Brunner said ammunition, which is the company that is working at was approached by a very
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:12.000]  large Korean company to create a touchscreen competitor.
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.240]  They wanted us to do it in six weeks left.
[01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:18.100]  We were like, you don't realize this was years.
[01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:20.280]  This was years of a lot of very good people.
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:21.760]  I wonder what company it was.
[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:23.960]  I guess I really don't I really hard to say.
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:29.360]  I guess it I guess it could have been LG, but it's pretty clearly Sam.
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:31.320]  So yeah, they do talk about they talk about LG earlier.
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:37.120]  But yeah, it doesn't we would like something like this and we would like it.
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:42.920]  We would like it in six weeks, but just slap something together.
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:44.240]  All right.
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:45.240]  Last thing.
[01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:47.680]  I'll just look at Apple's I'm looking at Apple's executive bio.
[01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:51.920]  So there's 14 SVPs or above.
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:54.320]  They talked to Cook.
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:59.840]  They talked to obviously Johnny and they talked to Jeff Williams, but there were and who knows
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:03.160]  maybe he talked to other people and they're just quotes didn't make it.
[01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:09.760]  But no EdiQ, no Federighi, no Luca Maestri Luca is what is he CFO and there's no right
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:11.760]  talk to the CFO.
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:16.400]  Dan Ricci gets mentioned Riccio hardware engineering where they were talking, but it wasn't a quote.
[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:21.560]  It was just like a story about in it, you know, like an engineering hassle and no Bruce
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:22.560]  Sewell.
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:23.560]  But why would you talk to a lawyer?
[01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:28.040]  Oh God, Bruce Sewell is probably just sweating over this article.
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:29.280]  You wanted nothing to do with it.
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:34.200]  Yeah, Bruce Sewell told me go fuck yourself.
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:40.040]  You better watch what you write.
[01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:43.920]  And no Schiller, but I'm not surprised by any of that.
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:46.840]  I am a little surprised by they talked to Jeff Williams.
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:51.360]  Yeah, I'm not quite sure why operations would rate.
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:58.920]  And you know, marketing or software engineering when you know, but I don't know like who knows
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:02.620]  he maybe talked to Federighi extensively and just I mean, maybe he felt that he was getting
[01:57:02.620 --> 01:57:09.460]  I mean the the Williams anecdotes are interesting just I mean because of the way he's reticent
[01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:15.360]  to talk and and then you know, maybe you talked to Schiller and he just felt like he was getting
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:18.720]  sprayed in the face with a fire hose of marketing stuff.
[01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:21.880]  Yeah, maybe could be.
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:23.520]  Anyway that feels like a show.
[01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:27.040]  John Moltz, I thank you.
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:30.680]  People can get all the Moltz they want.
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:31.680]  By driving by my house.
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:33.720]  By driving by his house.
[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:34.720]  Look for his new car.
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:36.880]  Don't key it up.
[01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:40.160]  Please please do not key my car.
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:47.640]  And you got the at Moltz Twitter account and you've got your very nice website dot net
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:53.520]  verynicewebsite.net and now you're on about eight different podcasts you got and working
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:54.520]  on another one.
[01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:56.520]  That's actually no shocker there.
[01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:57.520]  Are you kidding me?
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:57:58.520]  Yeah, right.
[01:57:58.520 --> 01:57:59.520]  Are you kidding me?
[01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:00.520]  How do you do it?
[01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:01.520]  I'm I'm exhausted.
[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:02.520]  Doing this one show a week.
[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:03.520]  Exhaust.
[01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:04.520]  Did I have it?
[01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:13.720]  Well, this is two shows worth have I mentioned apparently not a very hard worker.
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:14.720]  You should see me.
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:16.160]  I this should be like a video show.
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:17.800]  You saying that you're going to do another podcast.
[01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:18.800]  I've slumped.
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:19.800]  I visibly slumped.
[01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:22.600]  It was like the air got let out of me and I don't have to do the show.
[01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:27.560]  OK, well, so my other two podcasts, my the turning this car around and the rebound.
[01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:30.240]  Both of both of them are like less than an hour.
[01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:34.760]  OK, so that's you know, that's your talk show right there we go because this is approaching
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:37.960]  two hours now and then the other one is just something I'm doing for fun that will never
[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:38.960]  make any money.
[01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:41.280]  So it will never have advertisers.
[01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:45.560]  It's just like it's going to be hanging out with if it ever comes to fruition, it's going
[01:58:45.560 --> 01:58:55.120]  to be hanging out with a couple of dudes talking about comic book TV shows.
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:56.120]  Just for you.
[01:58:56.120 --> 01:58:59.680]  We'll have you on all right.
[01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:00.680]  That's great.
[01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:17.360]  Have a great week.
