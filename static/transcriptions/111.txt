[00:00.000 --> 00:02.800]  Saving your pennies for a $10,000 app watch.
[00:02.800 --> 00:07.000]  I am going bottom of the line, because you used, you see.
[00:07.000 --> 00:09.800]  I'm refurbished.
[00:09.800 --> 00:10.800]  Please.
[00:10.800 --> 00:15.000]  I need to call them refurbished.
[00:15.000 --> 00:17.800]  If I could get one refurbished, I probably would.
[00:17.800 --> 00:28.480]  My philosophy is that, particularly with the early ones, just to be price-conscious because
[00:28.480 --> 00:33.480]  I'm not, you know, I am not completely sold on the benefits of it yet, and I don't
[00:33.480 --> 00:34.480]  want to dump.
[00:34.480 --> 00:43.480]  And I think that the ramp up is going to get is steeper in the beginning.
[00:43.480 --> 00:46.280]  I'm fascinated by it, because I think it's so much fun.
[00:46.280 --> 00:51.880]  I think it's a very fun time to be in our racket of talking about Apple and writing
[00:51.880 --> 00:52.880]  about Apple.
[00:52.880 --> 00:55.880]  Because nobody has any idea what the hell is going on, and I love it.
[00:55.880 --> 00:56.880]  I really do.
[00:56.880 --> 01:00.560]  I love that we're all just lost, and I'm not pretending that I'm not lost.
[01:00.560 --> 01:02.560]  I'm completely lost.
[01:02.560 --> 01:03.560]  I don't know.
[01:03.560 --> 01:04.560]  Why?
[01:04.560 --> 01:05.560]  I'm totally...
[01:05.560 --> 01:10.680]  And you're lost, because why, because you're not sure of what it does yet, or...?
[01:10.680 --> 01:11.680]  Exactly.
[01:11.680 --> 01:16.800]  I'm in terms of, like, price-room aside, like, let's just assume I'm just getting
[01:16.800 --> 01:21.160]  the aluminum-based model, because I'm a skeptic.
[01:21.160 --> 01:25.240]  And I feel like if I love it, maybe I'll get a more expensive one next year, whatever.
[01:25.240 --> 01:27.080]  I still have no idea why I would want to wear.
[01:27.080 --> 01:28.080]  I really don't.
[01:28.080 --> 01:29.080]  You know.
[01:29.080 --> 01:30.160]  I wear a watch for time.
[01:30.160 --> 01:31.560]  You do wear a watch, though.
[01:31.560 --> 01:32.560]  Yes.
[01:32.560 --> 01:33.560]  Yes.
[01:33.560 --> 01:34.560]  Yeah.
[01:34.560 --> 01:39.960]  I have wore a watch forever, and the battery died on my, like, right before Christmas,
[01:39.960 --> 01:40.960]  and I was like, well, it's great.
[01:40.960 --> 01:43.560]  I'm not going to spend 15 bucks in a battery.
[01:43.560 --> 01:46.440]  I'm going to wait until April.
[01:46.440 --> 01:52.440]  So I have not been wearing one since slightly before Christmas.
[01:52.440 --> 01:53.440]  Does it drive you nuts?
[01:53.440 --> 01:54.440]  How quickly did you get used to it?
[01:54.440 --> 01:59.040]  I'm still, I still would rather, I, like, till just look at my hand for the time.
[01:59.040 --> 02:04.320]  I've worn a watch since I was, I don't know, 15, 14, 15, sometime in, like, middle
[02:04.320 --> 02:05.320]  school.
[02:05.320 --> 02:06.320]  Yeah.
[02:06.320 --> 02:07.320]  Do you ever have a pocket watch?
[02:07.320 --> 02:08.320]  No.
[02:08.320 --> 02:10.720]  My grandfather did that.
[02:10.720 --> 02:14.080]  My grandmother had given me a pocket watch, so I care, I sell for a while, I had a pocket
[02:14.080 --> 02:17.080]  watch.
[02:17.080 --> 02:18.920]  Embarrassing facts about me.
[02:18.920 --> 02:20.760]  Ah, they were very cool, though.
[02:20.760 --> 02:21.760]  I don't know.
[02:21.760 --> 02:23.720]  It was not the way I did it.
[02:23.720 --> 02:24.720]  No.
[02:24.720 --> 02:25.720]  No.
[02:25.720 --> 02:26.720]  I just know.
[02:26.720 --> 02:27.720]  I just know.
[02:27.720 --> 02:28.720]  I just know.
[02:28.720 --> 02:29.720]  Cut, cut.
[02:29.720 --> 02:33.200]  He had a piece a couple years ago about how the, and I totally understand, like, all
[02:33.200 --> 02:36.840]  the people out there, I'm sure that probably 70% of the people listening right now are
[02:36.840 --> 02:40.760]  all still thinking the same thing, which is, I don't wear a watch because my phone's
[02:40.760 --> 02:46.200]  with me all the time and I can take it out and get the time from the phone, which is,
[02:46.200 --> 02:47.440]  I totally valid.
[02:47.440 --> 02:51.440]  It's just, and maybe if I was a kid today, that's what I would do, that I, you know,
[02:51.440 --> 02:53.080]  never, it's just that I have the habit.
[02:53.080 --> 02:57.800]  I've, you know, 20, 20 some years of wearing a watch every day, I mean, it's hard to
[02:57.800 --> 02:58.800]  have it to break.
[02:58.800 --> 03:02.840]  Cocky had a piece, I think, I think it was cocky a couple of years ago, where he just,
[03:02.840 --> 03:07.080]  you know, pointed out that using your smartphone as your watch is pretty much the exact
[03:07.080 --> 03:12.840]  same mechanism as, you know, our grandfathers with their pocket watches in your pocket.
[03:12.840 --> 03:13.840]  You take it out.
[03:13.840 --> 03:17.920]  You hit a flip of the thing and you got the time and you put it back.
[03:17.920 --> 03:20.640]  And I'm not, you know, it works.
[03:20.640 --> 03:26.640]  I just, I, I, I feel like it's a distraction with my kid around.
[03:26.640 --> 03:32.520]  Like the minute I get my phone out, it becomes like a, I go, Oh, that's, you know, what's
[03:32.520 --> 03:35.760]  going on on, on dad's phone.
[03:35.760 --> 03:40.280]  What's, what games does dad have and what can I, can I play with dad's phone?
[03:40.280 --> 03:44.800]  And so it seems like a watch is a little easier, although I'm not sure like a smart watch
[03:44.800 --> 03:46.200]  is going to be much better.
[03:46.200 --> 03:50.160]  Like, that will be a whole different series of abstractions.
[03:50.160 --> 03:57.320]  Yeah, I, I don't know, it's, I never was impressed with the, the notifications using
[03:57.320 --> 04:01.600]  the pebble, but, you know, maybe the fact that you can interact with them here will make
[04:01.600 --> 04:02.600]  a difference.
[04:02.600 --> 04:07.680]  I don't know that you could in a pinch, you can dictate, you know, a reply using Siri.
[04:07.680 --> 04:08.680]  I'm, I'm still unsure.
[04:08.680 --> 04:11.440]  Anyway, the two, so there's two reasons that I feel like I'm totally lost.
[04:11.440 --> 04:15.280]  I still don't quite get what it is that I would like about this.
[04:15.280 --> 04:20.760]  Um, and number two is this whole edition model, I, I, I, I totally think it's going to cost
[04:20.760 --> 04:22.360]  thousands of dollars.
[04:22.360 --> 04:28.240]  I totally don't understand how they'll sell a thing for thousands of dollars that presumably
[04:28.240 --> 04:33.520]  is going to be, you know, outdated in three years, technically.
[04:33.520 --> 04:34.520]  I don't get it.
[04:34.520 --> 04:38.480]  Like I totally think they're going to do it, I totally don't get how that works.
[04:38.480 --> 04:39.480]  It's going to work.
[04:39.480 --> 04:40.480]  Yeah.
[04:40.480 --> 04:44.160]  And your, your view of the price points, remind me of your view of the price points.
[04:44.160 --> 04:51.360]  So we know that we know the, the aluminum one 350, you think the stainless one is going
[04:51.360 --> 04:54.720]  to be a thousand, is that right?
[04:54.720 --> 04:55.720]  Yeah.
[04:55.720 --> 04:56.720]  Yeah.
[04:56.720 --> 04:57.720]  That's my ballpark.
[04:57.720 --> 04:58.720]  And I've been thinking about it.
[04:58.720 --> 05:04.360]  I think, but I think it could be something like, like that it averages to a thousand, because
[05:04.360 --> 05:09.400]  like let's say like if you get the stainless with a, with something other than the metallic
[05:09.400 --> 05:14.080]  band, maybe it's like seven hundred dollars or six, six forty nine, you know, six
[05:14.080 --> 05:16.920]  hundred fifty bucks for the stainless to start.
[05:16.920 --> 05:21.840]  But if you get the one with the metal band or that mesh metal band, maybe it's like
[05:21.840 --> 05:24.320]  eleven hundred dollars.
[05:24.320 --> 05:27.280]  And I know that there's a lot of people who know nothing about watches are like, well,
[05:27.280 --> 05:29.920]  why in the world would the metal band make it cost five hundred more dollars?
[05:29.920 --> 05:34.000]  But if you look at the way watches are priced, that's, that's actually pretty typical.
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.840]  Like the metal bands on a premium watch are crazy expensive.
[05:37.840 --> 05:38.840]  Yeah.
[05:38.840 --> 05:39.840]  Yeah.
[05:39.840 --> 05:40.840]  Yeah.
[05:40.840 --> 05:44.560]  Some people I've talked to seem to think that the stainless one will be like five hundred
[05:44.560 --> 05:47.640]  bucks, but I don't think so either.
[05:47.640 --> 05:50.720]  That doesn't seem like that's, I mean, I only think that works if you're trying to
[05:50.720 --> 05:52.720]  upsell.
[05:52.720 --> 05:54.640]  And I don't think at this point they will be.
[05:54.640 --> 05:55.640]  Yeah.
[05:55.640 --> 05:59.080]  I think that they, you know, they, and it brings up another point with something that
[05:59.080 --> 06:03.440]  almost, I haven't seen anybody talk about is, are there going to be storage tiers?
[06:03.440 --> 06:08.160]  Is there going to be like an eight, sixteen, thirty two gigabyte split?
[06:08.160 --> 06:16.600]  I don't think so unless it corresponds to the materials, like if sport is eight gigabytes
[06:16.600 --> 06:22.480]  and stainless is sixteen and addition is thirty two.
[06:22.480 --> 06:28.360]  But I don't, I can't see how they would do aluminum at eight, sixteen, thirty two and
[06:28.360 --> 06:31.760]  keep adding fifty bucks or a hundred bucks or something like that.
[06:31.760 --> 06:32.760]  Yeah.
[06:32.760 --> 06:35.680]  It seems to, at that point, it seems way too confusing because you've got all these, you
[06:35.680 --> 06:39.440]  know, it seems like all of the choice you have to make is about what colors you want and
[06:39.440 --> 06:40.680]  what bands you want.
[06:40.680 --> 06:46.200]  And then if you multiply that by two or three with storage tiers, it's, you know, it's
[06:46.200 --> 06:47.200]  insane.
[06:47.200 --> 06:48.200]  And he's to start with though.
[06:48.200 --> 06:53.480]  The apps are basically almost like shells for things that are going on on the phone, right?
[06:53.480 --> 06:55.680]  The apps will add anyway.
[06:55.680 --> 06:56.680]  Yeah.
[06:56.680 --> 06:59.800]  The only thing that I could think you'd need storage for right now, the third party,
[06:59.800 --> 07:02.880]  I mean, but they said though, they've already announced that there will be a full, quote,
[07:02.880 --> 07:05.360]  full SDK later in the year.
[07:05.360 --> 07:09.200]  So there will be some space that you'll need for apps.
[07:09.200 --> 07:13.520]  But it's so, so even though off, right off the start with the initial SDK, they're kind
[07:13.520 --> 07:20.360]  of thin, thin apps that just communicate over the air to your iPhone apps.
[07:20.360 --> 07:24.480]  Let's presume that later in the year means that, you know, obviously this year, so you're
[07:24.480 --> 07:27.760]  going to need to put apps on anything.
[07:27.760 --> 07:33.200]  It has the photos app, but I would guess, right, that it's going to be there, you know,
[07:33.200 --> 07:37.280]  if it's only one and a half inches big, they can shrink the photos before they sync them
[07:37.280 --> 07:39.000]  over to your watch.
[07:39.000 --> 07:44.800]  Like I don't think, yeah, I don't think that you're going to need a lot of storage for
[07:44.800 --> 07:46.160]  your photos.
[07:46.160 --> 07:50.400]  And what else is there?
[07:50.400 --> 07:52.600]  I guess you use it, right?
[07:52.600 --> 07:53.600]  Yeah.
[07:53.600 --> 07:54.600]  Right.
[07:54.600 --> 07:55.600]  So it's just audio.
[07:55.600 --> 07:58.680]  So, you know, I don't think you need a lot of storage.
[07:58.680 --> 08:03.720]  It would still be nicer if it was 16 instead of eight, but I don't know.
[08:03.720 --> 08:06.400]  But nobody's really talking about that.
[08:06.400 --> 08:07.400]  No.
[08:07.400 --> 08:08.400]  I know.
[08:08.400 --> 08:14.600]  Yeah, I lived with a four gigabyte iPhone for two years and, you know, it was pretty tight
[08:14.600 --> 08:18.520]  at the end, but back then it worked.
[08:18.520 --> 08:22.600]  So yeah, especially if you didn't need a lot of music.
[08:22.600 --> 08:23.600]  My tastes are simple.
[08:23.600 --> 08:24.600]  Yeah.
[08:24.600 --> 08:25.600]  Yeah.
[08:25.600 --> 08:31.920]  Right now it's movies, it's video and all the mega triple-aid iPhone games.
[08:31.920 --> 08:37.360]  Oh, so the other thing that I wonder about is if there's a, I'm, I was leaning towards
[08:37.360 --> 08:41.640]  getting the smaller one because I don't have a very big wrist and I've traditionally gotten,
[08:41.640 --> 08:45.360]  like men's watches, you can often get in like a smaller size.
[08:45.360 --> 08:48.960]  I don't buy ladies watches, but you can get a men's watch in a smaller size.
[08:48.960 --> 08:53.880]  And I was leaning towards the smaller one, but the only thing that makes me wonder is if
[08:53.880 --> 08:56.400]  there's going to be a big difference in battery life between the two.
[08:56.400 --> 08:57.400]  Yeah.
[08:57.400 --> 09:00.000]  And whether there'll be a price difference too.
[09:00.000 --> 09:01.000]  I mean, I've been priced at it.
[09:01.000 --> 09:04.160]  Yeah, I'm assuming there would not be, but that's possible.
[09:04.160 --> 09:06.960]  Yeah, I don't know.
[09:06.960 --> 09:11.440]  And I guess in the addition model, there almost certainly would be because even though you're
[09:11.440 --> 09:16.440]  not really paying for the gold, you know, like the gold is just a fraction of the price
[09:16.440 --> 09:22.120]  I think it's still, I feel like once you're into premium materials, you kind of have
[09:22.120 --> 09:24.880]  to decide, you know, you have to pay by the price.
[09:24.880 --> 09:26.040]  Right.
[09:26.040 --> 09:31.820]  And the other thing is, I've always, I mean, it's just, the smart watches still are huge
[09:31.820 --> 09:32.820]  by and large.
[09:32.820 --> 09:37.080]  I mean, the ones that are out right now are gigantic and it's the ones, you know, the
[09:37.080 --> 09:39.480]  Android wear ones are very large.
[09:39.480 --> 09:45.000]  And the large one is not too much smaller than most of those, whereas the small one is fairly
[09:45.000 --> 09:46.560]  significantly smaller than those.
[09:46.560 --> 09:47.560]  Yeah.
[09:47.560 --> 09:53.680]  And I had a Motorola 360 on my wrist one time and it was, it was way too big.
[09:53.680 --> 09:56.800]  Yeah, it's definitely pretty big.
[09:56.800 --> 10:04.760]  Although you have to, you know, the first one I saw in real life was I ran into Andy and
[10:04.760 --> 10:12.240]  not go at the airport on the way out to the, the iPhone Apple watch event actually, he
[10:12.240 --> 10:13.640]  was flying through Philly.
[10:13.640 --> 10:17.160]  He'd like Boston the Philly to the SFO and we were on the same flight.
[10:17.160 --> 10:23.160]  Um, and it was like, this is weird, that guy looks just like Andy and it's like, oh,
[10:23.160 --> 10:24.160]  my God, it is.
[10:24.160 --> 10:25.160]  Yeah.
[10:25.160 --> 10:30.640]  So, you know, he's, you know, it's a serious sized man.
[10:30.640 --> 10:33.600]  It looked okay on his wrist, totally looked okay on his wrist.
[10:33.600 --> 10:35.280]  It looked goofy on me.
[10:35.280 --> 10:37.160]  Yeah, it doesn't look good on me at all.
[10:37.160 --> 10:38.720]  No, it's pretty big.
[10:38.720 --> 10:41.360]  Not much looks good on me, but that definitely did not look good on me.
[10:41.360 --> 10:42.960]  Yeah, it's not huge.
[10:42.960 --> 10:44.760]  It's not goofy.
[10:44.760 --> 10:46.640]  It's just, it's big though.
[10:46.640 --> 10:47.640]  It was pretty goofy.
[10:47.640 --> 10:48.640]  Yeah.
[10:48.640 --> 10:49.640]  Yeah.
[10:49.640 --> 10:53.560]  Well, it's funny because you know that a millimeter is very small, right?
[10:53.560 --> 10:57.840]  A tenth of a centimeter is, you know, one millimeter is pretty, you know, give or take.
[10:57.840 --> 11:02.240]  Um, and so you see all, you know, watches are always sized in millimeters and it's, you
[11:02.240 --> 11:06.200]  know, you see that this one's 39 and this one's 42 and you think, wow, that's probably
[11:06.200 --> 11:07.200]  about the same size.
[11:07.200 --> 11:08.200]  But like, it's not true.
[11:08.200 --> 11:12.560]  Like a 39 is sort of like a traditional men's wrist watch size by today's standards.
[11:12.560 --> 11:16.320]  A little small and 42 is actually kind of a big watch.
[11:16.320 --> 11:19.720]  Like the really big ones, like people are selling like 46 millimeter watches.
[11:19.720 --> 11:20.720]  Yeah.
[11:20.720 --> 11:21.720]  Yeah.
[11:21.720 --> 11:24.280]  Now probably I think part of the problem with the Motorola 360 is just that it's a, it's a
[11:24.280 --> 11:25.280]  cylinder.
[11:25.280 --> 11:28.880]  Um, that doesn't, the edges aren't graduated at all.
[11:28.880 --> 11:34.040]  And so it, it just sits right up on top of your wrist all the way around.
[11:34.040 --> 11:35.040]  Yeah.
[11:35.040 --> 11:40.600]  So it's not so much, it's not necessarily the diameter as it is, that does design or
[11:40.600 --> 11:41.600]  lack thereof.
[11:41.600 --> 11:42.600]  Yeah.
[11:42.600 --> 11:49.200]  Yeah, no, I think it's, they've totally, and I know that it looking at them on the web,
[11:49.200 --> 11:54.920]  it's, it's, you can't tell that it's so much smaller than competing smart watches.
[11:54.920 --> 11:58.080]  But once they're out in the real world and people can compare them side by side, I think
[11:58.080 --> 12:00.000]  the difference is pretty striking.
[12:00.000 --> 12:01.480]  And who knows what that means for battery life.
[12:01.480 --> 12:05.760]  I mean, clearly it has some kind of, you know, some kind of hit on battery life because
[12:05.760 --> 12:09.920]  the, you know, bigger, bigger, bigger watch has a bigger battery.
[12:09.920 --> 12:13.280]  And famously, everybody is saying, everybody who knows anything about the, you know,
[12:13.280 --> 12:16.320]  the rumors of the watch, you know, everybody's saying the same thing that, you know,
[12:16.320 --> 12:21.280]  battery life is a huge concern, you know, and they're obviously very cagey about it.
[12:21.280 --> 12:27.120]  And they're, what they've said publicly, do you think that the, that them getting all
[12:27.120 --> 12:35.040]  these people from Tesla is related to just battery in general or, or I don't know enough
[12:35.040 --> 12:44.960]  saving up for your car. I don't know, I, I don't know enough about battery technology.
[12:44.960 --> 12:52.520]  Even though I should because in sixth grade, my science fair project was about batteries.
[12:52.520 --> 12:53.840]  Since then, though, I've fallen.
[12:53.840 --> 12:59.880]  You should dig it up. You should go back and I have fallen way behind on my understanding.
[12:59.880 --> 13:06.800]  I have no idea whether somebody who is an expert in the sort of big battery that you
[13:06.800 --> 13:14.280]  would need to move a sedan for 300 miles would have any kind of expertise that would be
[13:14.280 --> 13:20.520]  applicable to the sort of battery you want in a, you know, seven millimeter thick phone.
[13:20.520 --> 13:25.040]  It strikes me as kind of like a jobsian thing to do to hire somebody who makes, makes
[13:25.040 --> 13:30.160]  a trunk sized battery and tell them, okay, and I just put that in a watch.
[13:30.160 --> 13:35.280]  I would, I, I'm thinking probably it is probably, you know, somebody who's an expert on
[13:35.280 --> 13:41.480]  one can, can quickly get up to speed on the other. It might be, it's as likely as anything,
[13:41.480 --> 13:54.120]  you know, who knows? I think that there's such a crazy, boom, or, or, you know, it's,
[13:54.120 --> 13:58.160]  it's a seller's market in Silicon Valley. If you're a talented engineer of any sort,
[13:58.160 --> 14:03.640]  it seems, you know, so I think, you know, who knows, it may not even be that specific.
[14:03.640 --> 14:07.480]  It may just be, you know, there's a bunch of smart guys at Tesla that's trying to steal
[14:07.480 --> 14:13.440]  them. We need, we need more smart people. I don't know, but the, you know, I guess that,
[14:13.440 --> 14:20.800]  you know, that's the other thing that broke at least since last I had a technical talk
[14:20.800 --> 14:24.960]  show is that the, the journal, I guess the Wall Street Journal was it who's more or I said
[14:24.960 --> 14:29.680]  flatly that Apple has what over 100 people working on a car. Right. As soon as I got a lot
[14:29.680 --> 14:36.960]  of people for it's, you know, still secret project. Yeah, I guess. I don't know. It doesn't
[14:36.960 --> 14:42.120]  have no idea when people would take to make a car. It makes even less sense to me than,
[14:42.120 --> 14:46.080]  and not that I would, not that they wouldn't, you know, like I think that the basic gist
[14:46.080 --> 14:52.480]  of, um, in broad, this is why the rumor I think catches people's imagination because in,
[14:52.480 --> 14:59.040]  in a broad sense, it feels basically like it could be true because, um, cars are a market
[14:59.040 --> 15:04.320]  where, hey, there's a lot of them. So there's a lot of money to be made. B, it's a market
[15:04.320 --> 15:09.920]  where design matters and has always mattered. Everybody accepts that design matters in cars.
[15:09.920 --> 15:14.800]  Right. There's not, it's not like with the computers where people, you know, for years
[15:14.800 --> 15:21.120]  would say, you know, Apple just wastes money on design. Uh, everybody just yet, you know,
[15:21.120 --> 15:24.400]  the same people who would say that would, you know, we'll spend, you know, three days picking
[15:24.400 --> 15:30.160]  out their new car because they, you know, care about it. Uh, so design matters and three,
[15:30.160 --> 15:36.560]  it feels like it's, you know, technology is about to revolutionize the industry. You know,
[15:36.560 --> 15:44.000]  people are talking, clearly there's the switch in energy from, uh, gas to electric. And, um,
[15:44.000 --> 15:50.000]  there's the whole self-driving angle. Yeah. As well as the, just the interface,
[15:50.000 --> 15:55.520]  interfaces that you interact with inside the car. Yes. Yes. Exactly. They're already involved in.
[15:55.520 --> 16:00.480]  Right. Right. And it's, you know, it all goes hand in hand where the cars are getting
[16:02.000 --> 16:09.280]  more computerized inside. Um, I mean, it's, they've been computerized for a while in terms of
[16:09.280 --> 16:13.840]  things like when the anti lock breaks kick in and stuff like that. But I'm being like the user
[16:13.840 --> 16:17.920]  in it, you know, what you deal with, you know, yeah. Have you shopped for a car recently? No,
[16:17.920 --> 16:24.240]  I have not shopped for a car since December 2006. So last time I shopped for a car, uh,
[16:24.240 --> 16:29.200]  the iPhone wasn't even out yet. Yeah. It's, I mean, some of that stuff is crazy. I,
[16:30.080 --> 16:37.680]  and I, I was going from, I've, so I bought a new car in December and I was going from a 95
[16:37.680 --> 16:48.400]  Integra. So, so I was not prepared for that level of screen in your face inside, uh, cars today.
[16:48.400 --> 16:53.360]  And, um, and I had an idea of the kind of cars that I've, you know, I had picked out certain
[16:53.360 --> 16:57.600]  cars to look at. And my first reaction was just like, oh my God, there's just, I mean, there's,
[16:57.600 --> 17:03.440]  there's two, not only is there one big screen, there's two screens in this car. And to do
[17:03.440 --> 17:10.640]  anything, you know, you have to be tapping a touch interface in order to like increase the airflow
[17:10.640 --> 17:16.640]  in the car and that kind of thing. And I was just like, I don't, that, uh, A, I was not ready for
[17:16.640 --> 17:21.280]  that coming from an old car. And B, I just don't think, I mean, for it, well, there's actually
[17:21.280 --> 17:28.000]  there's like B and C because B, I feel like driving, I would rather have some touch, some tactile
[17:28.000 --> 17:35.120]  elements and see the interfaces that they make for these things are so bad. I didn't want,
[17:35.120 --> 17:39.600]  you know, I wanted to have as little commitment to that interface as possible. So, I ended up
[17:39.600 --> 17:44.960]  getting a car that had this relay, I mean, had the smallest screen that I could get. But, you know,
[17:44.960 --> 17:49.280]  basically in a certain classic car, you kind of have to get that kind of screen with a crappy
[17:49.280 --> 17:54.000]  interface jammed into it. Yeah, I'm worried about that about getting a new car. Yeah. Because I
[17:54.000 --> 17:59.200]  feel like now it's not, when we got ours in 2006, we had the option to upgrade to a navigation
[17:59.200 --> 18:04.320]  system. And I turned it down because I thought it looked so terrible. And it wasn't the same,
[18:04.320 --> 18:09.200]  you know, it was like 700 extra bucks or something like that. Um, I turned it down, not because I
[18:09.200 --> 18:13.280]  didn't think the navigation would be useful, but just because I thought that this without the
[18:13.280 --> 18:18.000]  navigation, they just put like a, you know, like an old school radio thing that takes up the space,
[18:18.000 --> 18:22.080]  like the screen isn't still there. So everything on, nothing in our car has a touch screen. Everything
[18:22.080 --> 18:27.520]  is a dial that you get twist and I like it. And then my wife complained, he complained for a
[18:27.520 --> 18:33.760]  couple of years because everyone said, Oh, we'd go somewhere where we needed directions and, you know,
[18:33.760 --> 18:39.440]  we didn't have a navigation. Right. Um, and then once the, you know, and then that wore off,
[18:39.440 --> 18:46.000]  you know, I forget at what point the phone became a, a decent navigation system, probably like
[18:46.000 --> 18:52.000]  2010, right? Something like that. That seems about right. Um, so, you know, I think in a long
[18:52.000 --> 18:56.240]  run, it worked out as a good decision, but I don't know what I'm going to do next. But it is true
[18:56.240 --> 19:01.040]  because it's like, you know, guys like us who lifelong Apple users, like we expect our computers
[19:01.680 --> 19:08.080]  interfaces to be Apple quality. Mm hmm. And, you know, even at their worst, like pick the worst
[19:08.080 --> 19:13.600]  eras, you know, like Mac OS 10, 10.0, uh, or something, it's still was better than, you know,
[19:13.600 --> 19:20.080]  it wasn't ugly and it wasn't confusing, you know, right. And I, I mean, I had my car for 20 years,
[19:20.080 --> 19:27.360]  I had that previous car for 20 years, I drove that thing. And I wanted to possibly have the
[19:27.360 --> 19:32.720]  option to drive this almost as long. Um, and the idea of sticking with some of those
[19:33.680 --> 19:36.960]  systems that I'm, you know, feel like they're going to be obsolete in a year.
[19:38.880 --> 19:44.160]  Doesn't seem like it doesn't seem like a good way to win that game. No, it doesn't.
[19:44.160 --> 19:51.280]  Um, let's take a break and I will thank our first sponsor and it's a new sponsor,
[19:52.320 --> 19:55.760]  um, named automatic. If you heard of these guys speaking at cars,
[19:56.800 --> 19:59.200]  I have heard of automatic. Yes. It's a great segue.
[19:59.600 --> 20:06.960]  Um, automatic is a small connected car adapter. It plugs into your car's diagnostic port.
[20:06.960 --> 20:11.200]  Now every car has one of these, every modern car. Uh, actually your old car didn't,
[20:11.200 --> 20:15.680]  every car since 1996 has one of these ports. So it's a good thing you got rid of that piece of crap.
[20:16.640 --> 20:20.880]  Actually, I know it wasn't a piece of, I love the old, actually, I love the actor and take her,
[20:20.880 --> 20:24.640]  but it was one year too young. Well, anyway, your new car has one. Every car has it. It's,
[20:24.640 --> 20:29.280]  it's a diagnostic port. And when you take your car in for service, it's what your mechanic
[20:29.280 --> 20:34.080]  plugs, you know, their diagnostic stuff in. Um, and has all sorts of information. Well,
[20:34.080 --> 20:38.160]  you, it's just, so this automatic is just a little dingus you plug in and you keep it there and then
[20:38.160 --> 20:44.720]  you pair to your phone and it connects your car, uh, to the internet. So what does it do? You can
[20:44.720 --> 20:49.040]  use it with their free mobile app, right? You just pay for the dingus and then you get a free app.
[20:49.040 --> 20:53.280]  Um, and if something like your check engine light comes on, right?
[20:54.960 --> 21:00.160]  I touch just a light that just means something is wrong. Take this to an expert. Well, if you've
[21:00.160 --> 21:05.280]  got automatic, you could just fire up the app and it'll tell you in plain English exactly why
[21:05.280 --> 21:09.360]  the check English check engine light is on. You know, maybe it's something serious, maybe it's
[21:09.360 --> 21:15.360]  something silly. Um, and if it's something silly, you can use the app to clear the light.
[21:15.360 --> 21:19.680]  If it's a small problem, right there from your phone, you can just say stop bugging me about that.
[21:20.640 --> 21:25.840]  Uh, log your trips and parking location. So you never lose your car. That's pretty awesome. So
[21:25.840 --> 21:30.240]  you go to the airport, you park on a parking garage or something like that. Um, you don't have to
[21:30.240 --> 21:36.000]  like take a photo or write down what, what your spot was. Um, the automatic does it for you
[21:36.800 --> 21:42.720]  automatically. Uh, even with gas prices as low as they are right now, uh, your driving habits
[21:42.720 --> 21:48.240]  can be costing you hundreds of dollars per year. Automatic scores your driving and coaches you
[21:48.240 --> 21:54.320]  to drive more effective efficiently and save. Um, so they're fans of the show. They remember back
[21:54.320 --> 21:58.400]  in the day, Merlin brought this up last week on the show back in the day when I had my driver
[21:58.400 --> 22:04.320]  license taken away for driving 90, 90 miles an hour on the freeway. Uh, and friends that I'm
[22:04.320 --> 22:08.080]  actually, if I had automatic, it would have warned me that I was driving too fast and I wouldn't
[22:08.080 --> 22:12.720]  have lost my license. Um, now they're default to 70 miles per hour. They give you a little like a
[22:12.720 --> 22:17.920]  tingle or something like that when you hit 70, but you can customize the speed. Um, so I'll, I would
[22:17.920 --> 22:25.280]  turn that up to like 89. Well, it's like I told Dan back in the day. I don't drive much, but when I do
[22:25.280 --> 22:33.440]  drive, I like to drive real fucking fast. Automatic can give you a warning. Um, and crash detection.
[22:33.440 --> 22:37.840]  If you get, this is say, God forbid, you get in a terrible car accident. You get in a car accident.
[22:37.840 --> 22:43.440]  Automatic can detect that and automatically call for help for free. Um, a human will even stay
[22:43.440 --> 22:49.760]  on the line with you until help arrives. Just call them right in. Um, it, they've got all
[22:49.760 --> 22:53.840]  sorts of new stuff crazy stuff. They've got integration with nests. So if you've got nest,
[22:53.840 --> 22:59.360]  um, at your house, you can get it set up so that when your car gets close, you know,
[22:59.360 --> 23:03.680]  thermostat goes up or down or whatever you want, you can connect it to things like that.
[23:03.680 --> 23:08.480]  I can't get into it all here. You can connect it to Twitter, to Google Docs, uh, connected home
[23:08.480 --> 23:14.880]  devices like those Philips hue lights, all sorts of cool stuff. It's amazing. Um, uh, I think they
[23:14.880 --> 23:21.520]  used the, if this, then that, uh, to, to do that, you go to if this, I F, T, T dot com slash
[23:21.520 --> 23:25.360]  automatic and find out more about the cool automatic things you can do. Here's what you do.
[23:25.360 --> 23:29.760]  So what does it cost? It's probably cost like $10,000, right? Just like a gold edition app.
[23:29.760 --> 23:37.840]  Watch. Nope. 99, 95, 100 bucks. Well, then again, the soak you on the subscription fees,
[23:37.840 --> 23:44.480]  right? Wrong. There are no subscription fees. What? You just buy the thing for 99,
[23:44.480 --> 23:50.960]  95, 100 bucks, stick it in your car's diagnostic port. Get the free app and you're done.
[23:50.960 --> 23:56.560]  That's it. And let me tell you this, that's the sucker price. Listeners of this show,
[23:57.360 --> 24:04.480]  you get 20% off. So you can get the thing for 80 bucks. Go to automatic.com slash talk show,
[24:04.480 --> 24:09.920]  automatic. They just spell it the, the regular way. No funny spellings. Um,
[24:09.920 --> 24:17.760]  for your Steve Jobs fans out there, automatic.com slash talk show. Buy the thing for 80 bucks,
[24:17.760 --> 24:23.440]  20% off and just stick it in your car and start having fun. So my thanks to them, 80 bucks.
[24:23.440 --> 24:28.560]  I can't believe that that's crazy. Honestly, you know, it's like to end the marketing. There's
[24:28.560 --> 24:34.400]  always or there's always those that branch of marketing that's and it's all over the web these days,
[24:34.400 --> 24:39.600]  you know, like this, this one silly trick will make your mustache grow thicker, you know,
[24:41.360 --> 24:45.120]  you know, that the, but it does seem to me like this diagnostic port. I didn't know anything
[24:45.120 --> 24:49.360]  about this. This seems like this diagnostic port on every car is like a serious like they don't
[24:49.360 --> 24:54.800]  want you to know secret. Yeah, right. Right. Like you can get all that information on your own,
[24:54.800 --> 25:00.560]  but they want you to come into the dealer for in pay $600 for the privilege. Right. Because if the car,
[25:00.560 --> 25:04.880]  you know, if it, if the car knows why the check engine like came on, they could easily,
[25:04.880 --> 25:09.280]  especially like we're and ties right into what we're saying, we're modern cars all have real
[25:09.280 --> 25:18.240]  screens. So they could put any text you want on it, right? Yeah. So, you know, by this thing,
[25:18.240 --> 25:22.480]  it's like, you're a sucker if you don't have it. And then you know what? And it's 80 bucks,
[25:22.480 --> 25:26.080]  you know that your car dealer, if your car dealer gave you this as an option, it would be like
[25:26.080 --> 25:32.880]  $800. It would be like an $800 option to have a smart car. 80 bucks. This is, this is the most
[25:32.880 --> 25:40.640]  amazing thing. Um, I don't know. What do you, do you think Apple's working on a car? I mean,
[25:40.640 --> 25:43.760]  it seems to me like one of those things like maybe, you know, maybe they're working on a lot of
[25:43.760 --> 25:47.760]  things. And maybe that's one of the things that are kind of going, you know, yeah, that's
[25:47.760 --> 25:53.200]  sort of this and see, see what we think. I mean, it's also just possible that the car that the
[25:53.200 --> 26:03.280]  driving around is just full of like Apple car play stuff. Wouldn't it be great if it was like just Bob
[26:03.280 --> 26:08.400]  Mansfield's group and just like to blow off some steam there. They like just bought an old
[26:08.400 --> 26:13.120]  screwing around. Yeah, they bought an old Chrysler minivan, but they put it on the company's dime.
[26:13.120 --> 26:17.360]  So that if anybody looked up the license plate, it would say it was registered to Apple, you know,
[26:17.360 --> 26:22.880]  Apple incorporated. Right. So it's like they paid for it out of petty cash because what they're saying,
[26:22.880 --> 26:27.440]  it's like a Chrysler minivan. So it's probably 15 grand. And then they just went to like Home Depot
[26:27.440 --> 26:31.840]  and just bought like a whole bunch of PVC piping and made some crazy thing off the top.
[26:36.080 --> 26:39.040]  And then just let the rumors, let the rumors stop start.
[26:41.360 --> 26:45.840]  Like it's nothing. It's just like some it all that's being used for is some intern going
[26:45.840 --> 26:51.200]  out to pick up saying, which is. And by the way, go about pick up some lunch. And by the way,
[26:51.200 --> 26:55.600]  drive this car and drive real slow.
[26:59.520 --> 27:01.680]  Don't go, don't go more than 10 miles an hour.
[27:05.280 --> 27:09.200]  That's the type of shit that I would do. That's why that's why I'm like, Chris Breen,
[27:09.200 --> 27:15.600]  I'm never getting hired by Apple. All I would want to do is waste money on shit like that.
[27:17.120 --> 27:20.480]  Wouldn't that be a great job at Apple? That actually would be some, you and I could do this.
[27:20.480 --> 27:26.160]  Like we would just start a team that would be like meant to just fill up the rumor blogs with
[27:26.160 --> 27:31.440]  deception. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, my God, we could. That's right.
[27:31.440 --> 27:34.480]  And so I've had to write in my wheelhouse, man. Oh, my God.
[27:34.480 --> 27:41.680]  I should call Shiller. We would just pick projects that just pitch that to Shiller.
[27:42.640 --> 27:49.280]  Pick projects that are plausible enough that you could get nine to five Mac and Mac rumors and
[27:49.280 --> 27:56.000]  and Apple insider to run with them. But that are goofy enough that we would never stop
[27:56.000 --> 28:07.840]  laughing. I have to say that the fact that the supposed car that's been caught on a road is a
[28:07.840 --> 28:17.200]  Chrysler minivan really makes me that that might be going on right now. And they're just laughing
[28:17.200 --> 28:21.120]  themselves silly because it just seems like something like like you would have started by saying,
[28:21.120 --> 28:26.560]  well, we'll do it in a like a Prius. Like doesn't a Prius seem like the like the default car you'd
[28:26.560 --> 28:31.680]  start with, you know, it's already electric. It's, you know, it's there. They're all over the place
[28:31.680 --> 28:36.160]  in California. And then as somebody would have the idea, no, let's make it a minivan.
[28:41.040 --> 28:45.760]  That's the thing I found. I even wrote this on the on the fireball site that with the Wall
[28:45.760 --> 28:49.760]  Street Journal report that there got a hundred people working on a car that they said that it's a
[28:49.760 --> 28:55.760]  looks like a minivan. I find that very hard to believe. I find that hard to believe too. Like,
[28:55.760 --> 29:01.200]  I don't find it hard to believe that they might have some kind of super early prototype that looks
[29:01.200 --> 29:05.520]  like a minivan. But that's not what they said. They're saying that they're working on a car that
[29:05.520 --> 29:10.640]  looks like a minivan. You know, you know, like they always say, like this story is public knowledge,
[29:10.640 --> 29:14.960]  we can get to the whole Jenny, I've New Yorker thing, but it's it came up there. I think it came up
[29:14.960 --> 29:20.960]  in the jobs, but it came up all over the place. We're like the very early prototypes for what became
[29:20.960 --> 29:28.240]  multi-touch was like projected on a desk. And they had like cameras of, I don't know, it was,
[29:28.240 --> 29:34.400]  it looked nothing like an iPad or a phone. It was big and it was like projected on a wall. It was
[29:34.400 --> 29:41.760]  because the sensors were, you know, weren't miniaturized yet. You know, I could see that the car,
[29:41.760 --> 29:45.680]  some kind of car that they intend to ship in 10 years might look like that now because they
[29:45.680 --> 29:49.520]  need to fill up the back with all kinds of crazy stuff that they'll worry about miniaturizing
[29:49.520 --> 29:52.880]  later. But I can't believe that they're working on a car that would actually look like
[29:52.880 --> 29:59.360]  a minivan. No. Because they would, I mean, they would work on that their car would be
[30:00.560 --> 30:05.440]  whatever the most, I mean, their starter car would certainly be whatever the most purchased type
[30:05.440 --> 30:12.720]  of car is. And that's not a minivan. No. I mean, it seems like it would be like a Ford or sedan.
[30:12.720 --> 30:16.320]  No. And they couldn't bring themselves to make something that wasn't beautiful.
[30:17.120 --> 30:20.160]  Right. You're saying Chrysler minivan's aren't beautiful.
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.080]  Making somebody a Chrysler very sad right now.
[30:27.280 --> 30:31.200]  It'd be funny if it like drove Shiller out of the company because it's like, you just, you know,
[30:31.200 --> 30:35.200]  all right, I'll stop wearing my good nice watches and wear this Apple watch. But if you
[30:35.200 --> 30:40.960]  want me to stop driving and load as a report and drive a minivan just because Apple has one
[30:40.960 --> 30:48.880]  for get them out of it. I'm out taking my portion, my, yeah. And my, whatever else drives down to
[30:48.880 --> 30:55.600]  the Cayman Island. Yeah, he drives good cars. Johnny, Johnny obviously has a few cars.
[30:55.600 --> 30:59.360]  Yeah. And, but, uh, Williams.
[30:59.360 --> 31:05.120]  Yeah. Drive. So, okay, an old, I ought to get old. I only carry. Yeah.
[31:05.920 --> 31:08.080]  I get the time to get good for him. I mean, I think that's great.
[31:08.560 --> 31:14.560]  I get the feeling that even at real. Jeff Williams is like, like a two thirds clone of Tim Cook,
[31:15.280 --> 31:20.240]  like there's like a two thirds central. You know what I mean? Because they used to say there
[31:20.240 --> 31:25.520]  was a profile of Tim Cook sometime in the last year or two, where he apparently drove a very
[31:25.520 --> 31:30.640]  old car for a very long time. I remember that. Um, you know, it was like when they said about
[31:30.640 --> 31:34.960]  what a mystery, you know, what a mystery was, even to the people who we worked with, you know, in a
[31:34.960 --> 31:43.040]  daily basis, you know, well, for those guys, it's all about efficiency. Yeah, it just feels like
[31:43.040 --> 31:47.120]  in a fission. Yeah, we're going operations and you want everything to run efficiently. And if you
[31:47.120 --> 31:56.560]  get something that's working, great. Just keep riding it. Yeah. Not me. I would, you know, I would
[31:56.560 --> 32:01.760]  probably, if I had the, you know, Apple executive type money, I would probably be more like Steve
[32:01.760 --> 32:06.160]  Jobs, though, where he had the one car, you know, you know, that he put a lot of thought into it,
[32:06.160 --> 32:12.560]  and he had one car, and it was awesome. Uh, but it was turning the lease over like every three weeks or
[32:12.560 --> 32:18.480]  something. Yeah, that's supposedly that's like, that was, that was supposedly how he got away with
[32:18.480 --> 32:23.040]  the never having a license plate was that he never had one for more than it's like, there's like,
[32:23.040 --> 32:28.480]  you got like 90 days before you have to have a license plate. And so like every three months,
[32:28.480 --> 32:33.120]  somebody would have to drive his Mercedes to the dealer. And I'm sure they just had one waiting.
[32:33.120 --> 32:41.280]  It's like a box of tissues, you know, they just pull another silver Mercedes SL 50
[32:41.280 --> 32:47.360]  with the, you know, precise interior right out of the box. Boom. And he's, he's got it.
[32:50.560 --> 32:54.400]  Right. I couldn't see, I could never see being a car collector because I could see buying one
[32:54.400 --> 32:58.560]  really nice car. And then I would drive it everywhere. But I would want to put all my effort into
[32:58.560 --> 33:06.160]  making that pick up front and picking the one that I, that I love. Um, if I had even two,
[33:06.160 --> 33:09.920]  I don't know how I would make the decision on any given day. I would, it would,
[33:09.920 --> 33:16.000]  we'd know which one to drive. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Like I like not having to make decisions like that.
[33:16.000 --> 33:22.640]  Yeah. I feel that way now that I have, I have like two good cameras. I have one that Canon that's
[33:22.640 --> 33:27.040]  bigger and a little, you know, still a little bit better and more flexible because it has multiple
[33:27.040 --> 33:33.280]  lenses. And then I've got this Fuji X100S, which is delightful. And it's that retro, you know,
[33:33.280 --> 33:38.240]  sort of looks like an old rangefinder, beautiful camera, a lot lighter really, you know, and unless
[33:38.240 --> 33:41.680]  I know that I'm going to be walking around with it on my neck all day, I know I want the lighter one,
[33:41.680 --> 33:44.880]  but there's a lot of like school events and stuff where it's like, I don't know which one to take.
[33:44.880 --> 33:47.440]  And then I think, why did I buy a second camera? Now I'm sitting here, you know,
[33:48.720 --> 33:56.000]  10 minutes staring at two cameras. Well, I get, I mean, for those guys, I guess it's just,
[33:56.000 --> 34:01.120]  that's the fun of it. Right. That's part of the fun is like, oh, man, I drove the wrong car today.
[34:01.920 --> 34:03.680]  I guess. I don't know. I should have driven the.
[34:03.680 --> 34:09.040]  Maybe I guess it's the famous thing. Right. And I guess if they break down all the time because
[34:09.040 --> 34:14.320]  they're all finicky at times, sports cars, you know, also part of the fun. Right.
[34:17.760 --> 34:22.000]  You don't be funny, too, because I guess the assumption is like, I'm like, look at like Apple
[34:22.000 --> 34:28.560]  watch. So there's variety, but there, you know, there's just one shape, you know, two sizes.
[34:28.560 --> 34:34.320]  Imagine like what the parking lot at Apple's new headquarters will look like, like three years
[34:34.320 --> 34:38.240]  after the Apple car comes out when everybody's driving the same mile car.
[34:43.040 --> 34:48.160]  I presume that they'll just bake in some kind of app that tells you which silver apple
[34:48.160 --> 34:51.360]  car is yours. Where's my silver apple car?
[34:51.360 --> 34:57.920]  Oh, boy.
[34:59.040 --> 35:04.080]  I look look forward to that problem. Yeah. So the big problem, one of the big problems with cars
[35:04.080 --> 35:08.560]  and Tesla famously is running into it all over the country is that there's this bizarre,
[35:09.680 --> 35:14.640]  well, it seems bizarre in hindsight. These bizarre laws, they're not even rules,
[35:14.640 --> 35:20.480]  they're laws about how cars are sold that there's this dealership model. And I forget the
[35:20.480 --> 35:27.040]  explanation. It makes sense historically and doesn't make sense in the present day.
[35:27.920 --> 35:32.080]  But the reason why all cars are sold through these independent dealers,
[35:33.440 --> 35:38.160]  that's like the law and Tesla doesn't want to get involved with that. They want to sell directly
[35:38.160 --> 35:43.840]  and they have to go like state by state and get stuff, you know, make it legal.
[35:44.400 --> 35:44.720]  Right.
[35:44.720 --> 35:50.960]  Like New Jersey, New Jersey, right? They haven't they just don't sell them in a Jersey.
[35:50.960 --> 35:56.240]  Yeah, New Jersey, it seems, you know, it seems like some sopranos type guys have some of the
[35:56.240 --> 36:01.920]  action in the car dealerships and they're sort of like, yeah, you know, you're going to be selling
[36:01.920 --> 36:11.360]  your little electric cars here. The same guys who run the gas pumps.
[36:11.360 --> 36:18.080]  Yeah. We talked about that. I feel like you and I have talked about this on this show. This is
[36:18.080 --> 36:22.240]  the crazy maybe. Yeah. So for those of you out there who don't know, have never been to New Jersey,
[36:22.240 --> 36:29.760]  in New Jersey, he is it all gasoline is pumped by a professional. There is no
[36:31.120 --> 36:35.920]  ordinance the same way. Right. Is it really so? Yeah. Are you West Coasters know what you're doing?
[36:35.920 --> 36:40.160]  Yeah, or no, and I'm talking about so I think most people around the country when you're pulling
[36:40.160 --> 36:44.080]  the gas station and it says self-serve, you're like, well, why, you know, of course, well,
[36:44.080 --> 36:50.400]  guess what? New Jersey has no self-serve. It's no option. It's legally you have to have your gas
[36:50.400 --> 36:55.440]  pumped by an attendant. And I don't know, it's three or four years ago, they got it as a state
[36:55.440 --> 37:00.960]  referendum. And I thought, Oh, great. This is great. Cause I go to New Jersey sometimes and I thought,
[37:00.960 --> 37:08.320]  this is great. I'll finally be able to pump my own gas. Nope. It's lost. New Jersey and devoted
[37:08.320 --> 37:16.480]  overwhelmingly to keep the law on the books. It's like Stockholm syndrome, like they're afraid
[37:16.480 --> 37:21.840]  to pump gas. They see it as some kind of luxury. I mean, I know the guy, the last time I pulled
[37:21.840 --> 37:28.400]  up to a gas pump in New Jersey, which was the last summer, the guy called me boss. That was pretty,
[37:28.400 --> 37:33.120]  that was kind of nice. Well, that's actually in the law as well. They only have to say that.
[37:33.120 --> 37:36.960]  Well, there's, you know, you have choices. They can call you boss. They can call you chief.
[37:36.960 --> 37:43.040]  Yeah. I was trying to remember it was bosser chief actually. Yeah. And, uh, and they can call you
[37:43.040 --> 37:49.200]  Haas. The get to pay extra for Haas. Yeah. But they could definitely call you chief. They can
[37:49.200 --> 37:57.040]  call you boss. Extra. It's an extra five cents a gallon. Fill it up and go ahead and Haas that
[38:01.680 --> 38:05.920]  absolutely Haas. Yeah. That was a slogan. Actually, when I was a kid, it was a slogan in
[38:05.920 --> 38:19.520]  that, uh, at Hess gas stations, hosted at Hess. So yeah, yeah, I know those guys will be out
[38:19.520 --> 38:23.520]  of a, out of a job of a world driving apple, electric apple cars.
[38:26.720 --> 38:31.120]  So I don't know. I mean, anything that apple does in this would have to, you know, go through the
[38:31.120 --> 38:40.160]  same, uh, rigamarole that Tesla's going through, um, who knows? I don't know. I think it,
[38:40.160 --> 38:44.720]  like you said, I think it's, you know, a maybe kind of sort of someday thing and they're just
[38:44.720 --> 38:47.920]  looking into it. Yeah, particularly if it looks like a Chrysler minivan right now, I mean, it's
[38:47.920 --> 38:52.560]  obviously not, it's obviously not ready to go into the showroom floor anytime soon. All right.
[38:54.240 --> 38:58.720]  The self driving thing I do think it's coming. I have no idea when to think, and it's obviously not
[38:58.720 --> 39:06.240]  imminent, you know, it's, it's, uh, but it feels like something that could be like, you know,
[39:06.240 --> 39:10.240]  we're not going to have to wait till we're old men, like we'll, we'll, we'll get to this in 10 or 15
[39:10.240 --> 39:17.440]  years. Yeah, yeah, maybe it's, yeah, because it's a, you think back 10 years, I think back 10
[39:17.440 --> 39:22.720]  years. And I think about like the laptop I was using, it's pretty stunning. I've been thinking
[39:22.720 --> 39:27.920]  about that a lot lately. And I, maybe it's always that 10 years is, you know, gives you a lot of
[39:27.920 --> 39:33.280]  eye openers and technology probably does. But somehow while we're still on the other side of the
[39:33.280 --> 39:40.880]  iPhone being 10 years, it really feels like right now, like 2015, 2016, it's the, the, what life
[39:40.880 --> 39:46.080]  was like 10 years ago was pretty, pretty crazy. Yeah, 2015 might be the big one to me,
[39:46.080 --> 39:52.080]  especially as an Apple nerd, just because there's no iPhone yet, uh, we're max, we're still
[39:52.080 --> 40:01.920]  power PC trying to think what else titanium. I think I was having a titanium power book back then.
[40:01.920 --> 40:08.880]  Yeah, I might have still been eye books. Um, yeah, yeah, they still had the plastic was first
[40:08.880 --> 40:15.120]  plastic eye books were still being sold. And the nicer plastic ones, the one that we were available
[40:15.120 --> 40:23.600]  white and black were were MacBooks, I believe, right MacBooks and MacBooks pros. Uh, yes,
[40:23.600 --> 40:31.920]  yeah, those are those were all Intel, right? And they were nicer. I think, yeah, so I think I still
[40:31.920 --> 40:38.880]  have probably still have that laptop here. I've got them all. I'm looking at it. Yeah,
[40:38.880 --> 40:45.280]  because I have a problem. It's not funny. I have a problem. Yeah, I can't wait till we all retire
[40:45.280 --> 40:53.440]  in the old folks home and we're all just, uh, if we need all this extra closet space, you can
[40:53.440 --> 41:01.040]  copy a tiger. Sir, use has got a bunch of stuff too. I don't know. You bet I got to copy a tiger.
[41:01.040 --> 41:04.640]  You know what? I don't have any old desktop max. Like I don't have like an old, uh,
[41:04.640 --> 41:11.760]  uh, uh, I got my G4, you know, like a Mac classic frame Mac or anything like that.
[41:13.120 --> 41:18.080]  Oh, no, I got you. I got one of those. I got two. Actually, yeah, two. I got two of those.
[41:18.080 --> 41:21.840]  If I were going to buy one, if my wife listened to this, she's going to have a shit fit.
[41:22.640 --> 41:27.600]  Uh, I would want to buy an SE 30. SE 30 is the law. Yeah, it makes my heart release.
[41:27.600 --> 41:31.600]  I have an SE. Um, it's not, it's not a 30, but I do have an SE.
[41:31.600 --> 41:36.640]  Because that was, that was my first, that was my first Mac. And it's based, it's, it's basically
[41:36.640 --> 41:46.160]  the same machine, which I, we know, I bought for $2,000 in 1990 used. And then, uh, the years later,
[41:46.160 --> 41:49.440]  I still had all the floppies and I had sold the machine a long time ago. And it's like,
[41:50.240 --> 41:54.240]  I want to try these floppies out again. So I bought another one. But the basically the same thing
[41:54.240 --> 42:00.080]  off eBay for a buck. I've got my floppies somewhere. I know I didn't throw them out. I,
[42:00.080 --> 42:03.920]  I cannot believe that any of them would still work. They used to fail when they were doing it.
[42:03.920 --> 42:08.400]  Yeah, I know. That's a great idea. Most of them still, most of mine still work.
[42:08.400 --> 42:14.400]  A lot of them do fail though. They used to fail brand new. Yeah. Maybe.
[42:16.800 --> 42:20.720]  It was just like the ones in zeros were just little pieces of dust stuck to the
[42:20.720 --> 42:31.200]  disk by static electricity. We're only one megabyte, but we're more reliable than zip.
[42:39.360 --> 42:42.880]  I did remember that though. That reminds me though, that the other thing in the, the, the
[42:42.880 --> 42:46.320]  Wall Street Journal had a couple of reports this week and the one was about the, uh,
[42:46.320 --> 42:53.040]  um, I think, I wrote it. I think it was such bullshit. This thing that the Apple watch, you know,
[42:53.040 --> 42:56.480]  like at the last minute, they took out all, they were supposed to be like a fitness health device
[42:56.480 --> 43:02.320]  and then they none of the sensors worked. So they yanked them out and had to redefine what it was
[43:02.320 --> 43:08.960]  for. Um, it, uh, but it did say that I don't know. I think it was so poorly sourced. Who
[43:08.960 --> 43:12.560]  know even knows if the number even came from anybody knows what the hell they're talking about,
[43:12.560 --> 43:18.640]  but that the, uh, Apple watch gold edition is expected to sell for 4,000 or more, which would make it
[43:19.360 --> 43:24.960]  the most expensive product they sell, you know, whatever sold or something like that, the
[43:24.960 --> 43:29.440]  compared to the wrong to the current Mac Pro. And I was thinking with you thought, I thought about
[43:29.440 --> 43:34.640]  the kid in college who had the Mac to FX that that was like a $10,000 computer at the time. Yeah.
[43:36.320 --> 43:40.960]  It's like, no, that is not, I remember when I like the cheap ones, like you said, like an SE was
[43:40.960 --> 43:48.400]  2,000. My, my Mac LC was like 2,500. Yeah. I mean, then, you know, and then the, you've got the
[43:49.200 --> 43:55.920]  20th anniversary one, which when I forget what that went for, but that was over $10,000 at least,
[43:55.920 --> 44:01.920]  right? My parents spent more on my computer that $2,500 LC than they spent on the college.
[44:01.920 --> 44:11.920]  It was crazy expensive. Everything was crazy expensive. I remember when I wrote that somebody on
[44:14.080 --> 44:17.680]  Twitter wrote that they had a 2CI at the time. Remember the Mac 2CI?
[44:18.880 --> 44:26.080]  Was that the, the road Apple one or was that it? The Mac 2CI was, it was right down the middle
[44:26.080 --> 44:32.640]  of the road. It was the type of desktop you could, I think it was, you could put it both ways on your
[44:32.640 --> 44:36.560]  desk like a PlayStation. You could have it standing up, you could turn it on its side and put like,
[44:36.560 --> 44:44.880]  it was perfectly sized for the 13 inch display. I, I would hold it up as I think the greatest Mac
[44:44.880 --> 44:52.160]  Apple ever made because they, it was in their lineup for like five years, like like around 90 or 91
[44:52.160 --> 44:57.840]  when it came out, it was a high-end machine, like right below like the 2FX like five, six, seven,
[44:57.840 --> 45:03.200]  eight thousand dollars, something like that. And they kept it for years, you know, and it would just
[45:03.200 --> 45:08.160]  drop down sort of like the first, you know, like what they do with the phones now, like the next
[45:08.160 --> 45:12.880]  year it just stayed and sold, you know, because it was still, it was like such a good machine and
[45:12.880 --> 45:17.760]  so fast at the time. It was a great, great, great computer. One of my friends in college had one
[45:17.760 --> 45:23.920]  loved it. Mac 2CI, but anyway, someone on Twitter reminded me about how expensive Ram was back then,
[45:23.920 --> 45:30.080]  like he said he had a two, got a 2CI in the early 90s and spent $5,800 on Ram. Oh my god.
[45:31.600 --> 45:36.960]  People have no idea how expensive computers are nowadays. It in guys like us would just wonder,
[45:36.960 --> 45:45.200]  why isn't everybody into computers? What's the matter? $5,800 on Ram.
[45:45.200 --> 45:53.280]  Because of course, like the default, it was like a $6,000 computer in 1991 and I bet that default
[45:53.280 --> 46:04.800]  config was like two megabytes around. Just terrible. Yeah. I think my LC had one megabyte around.
[46:04.800 --> 46:08.800]  Oh really? By default. I've had eventually some point. Yeah, no, that sounds about right.
[46:08.800 --> 46:13.280]  Yeah, at some point over the years I skrimped and saved and got it upgraded to 10,
[46:13.280 --> 46:19.440]  which was, I don't know, doesn't even make any sense. Maybe it had two to start,
[46:19.440 --> 46:23.920]  maybe that was it. It had two soldered on the motherboard and I could put, you could add two,
[46:23.920 --> 46:29.840]  four megabyte chips and get it up to 10. I don't know. Somebody could look it up, but I'm not going
[46:29.840 --> 46:36.800]  to. Let's take a break and then maybe we could talk about the Johnny I've,
[46:36.800 --> 46:47.600]  yeah, mini book in the New York. Let me tell you, it's our good friends, our next sponsor,
[46:47.600 --> 46:52.720]  it's our good friends. It's Squarespace. You guys know Squarespace. It's the all in one

[50:14.000 --> 50:26.720]  Great friends of the show. So the New Yorker piece, 17,000 words almost by Ian Parker on Johnny
[50:26.720 --> 50:38.160]  Ive and the design team at Apple. I'm almost through it. I had no idea. It was funny. I didn't
[50:38.160 --> 50:42.400]  know. I didn't do like a word count first. I just woke up and there was a lot of everybody
[50:42.400 --> 50:48.480]  is tweeting about it. Oh, this is intriguing. Because it was very clear right from the opening
[50:48.480 --> 50:56.160]  that this was written with their, you know, apples and Johnny Ives participation, cooperation,
[50:57.920 --> 51:02.000]  which in and of itself is maybe the most interesting and intriguing thing about it.
[51:03.920 --> 51:11.200]  And it literally took me hours. I started thinking like, have I gotten slow? Am I
[51:11.200 --> 51:16.960]  adult? Why is it taking me so long to read a magazine article? And then I counted the words and
[51:16.960 --> 51:22.080]  I was like, wait a minute, that's like a third of a book. I guess a book is like 60,000 words.
[51:24.480 --> 51:27.200]  Truly extraordinary. You got to wait. You got to wait to act three to get to you.
[51:28.400 --> 51:33.520]  That was a surprise. I had actually had no idea. That was a total surprise. So like two thirds of
[51:33.520 --> 51:41.040]  the way through the article, like 12,000 words into it. Yes, that was a mention quote from me.
[51:42.640 --> 51:47.120]  And I have to say that was like a total. I mean, I'm used to people quoting me and seeing my name,
[51:47.120 --> 51:53.840]  but in the New Yorker, it was kind of a surprise slash shock slash thrill. Yeah, I would think so.
[51:54.480 --> 51:59.040]  I wouldn't know, but I would think so. Oh, you didn't they didn't quote you. They don't
[51:59.040 --> 52:02.960]  think I'm in this. It's very strange. Wait, I'm trying to find a URL here.
[52:07.120 --> 52:11.120]  I probably should have loaded this up before starting to think a lot of load.
[52:13.520 --> 52:14.640]  My dick escaped down.
[52:16.160 --> 52:19.840]  Here's where I was hoping that here's what it says.
[52:21.680 --> 52:24.480]  This is actually an interesting point. It's just like the type of thing I like to talk about
[52:24.480 --> 52:29.120]  I'm talking about. So it's at a point where they're talking about Apple Watch and that they've
[52:29.120 --> 52:35.600]  hired Angela Arntz from Burberry and Paul Deneve. I'm not quite sure how to pronounce his name.
[52:35.600 --> 52:42.560]  Denneve former CEO of the Eve St. Lawrence Group, Patrick Pruno. I hope I'm pronouncing his name
[52:42.560 --> 52:48.640]  correctly from Tag Power. Hope I'm pronouncing Tag Power, right.
[52:48.640 --> 52:53.840]  Hoyer Tag Hoyer. Tag Hoyer. Thank you, John. Yeah, I didn't know about the second two. I mean, I
[52:53.840 --> 52:59.120]  obviously knew about the first two. No, I knew about him. I think I knew about that from Ben Thompson
[52:59.120 --> 53:04.400]  because Ben is really, really knows this shit about the luxury industry. Like LVMH is such an
[53:04.400 --> 53:12.160]  interesting company. They're like a huge luxury conglomerate. The LVMH is Louis Vuitton,
[53:12.160 --> 53:21.920]  handbag suitcase, luxury shoemaker. And MH is the, I forget what the H is. Oh, H is Hennessy,
[53:21.920 --> 53:27.680]  like the, was that cognac? Yeah. One of the few, few, few booses. I'm not really that familiar
[53:27.680 --> 53:35.680]  with them. M is Moet. M. O. E. T. the Champagne. So it's handbags, champagne,
[53:35.680 --> 53:44.640]  who's expensive of cognac and watches. It's a very, it's an interesting conglomerate. But yeah,
[53:44.640 --> 53:53.520]  it hired a watch guy from there. And he was a guy, his job at Tag Hoyer was, he dealt with their
[53:53.520 --> 53:59.120]  like retail liaisons. Like he wasn't like a watch designer. He wasn't from like the creating of
[53:59.120 --> 54:04.720]  the watches. He was one of the guys who dealt with their, you know, like which jewelry stores
[54:04.720 --> 54:08.560]  are going to sell, you know, which watches and stuff like that. And what are they, you know,
[54:08.560 --> 54:13.920]  negotiating that sort of stuff. So it's an interesting hire because there's circling all the way
[54:13.920 --> 54:20.800]  back to the things we don't know about Apple Watch. If, if we're right that the, the high end
[54:20.800 --> 54:26.240]  edition is going to be let's say four, five, $10,000 or something like that. How and where are you
[54:26.240 --> 54:31.040]  going to buy it? Because the Apple stores as they exist today are not the sort of place where you go
[54:31.040 --> 54:37.120]  and spend $10,000 on a watch, right? You don't buy them in a noisy cacophonous room where, you know,
[54:37.680 --> 54:40.960]  you're not going to do that thing where you, you pre-pay and you come in and pick it up.
[54:43.120 --> 54:45.520]  Charge it to my vote. I'll take this one. Yoy.
[54:48.320 --> 54:53.360]  You imagine they were just up there like like right next to the Apple cases to the phone cases.
[54:53.360 --> 54:57.920]  This is just a bunch of watches you just pick up out there. Right. Well, that's a, yeah,
[54:57.920 --> 55:01.920]  that's the thing. I mean, they're, they're redesigning the whole store experience, right?
[55:02.960 --> 55:06.320]  Well, that's, I mean, that's the thing that we don't know and really talked about that much
[55:06.320 --> 55:10.000]  from what I've seen. And, and we would probably be talking about like crazy if there weren't
[55:10.000 --> 55:15.600]  this other thing going on. Um, that is really the reason for that thing. But supposedly they're,
[55:15.600 --> 55:21.520]  they're really going to redo. Right. One of the, one of the, one of the nuggets dropped in this
[55:21.520 --> 55:26.640]  article is that Johnny I was working with Angela Arnce on a, I think it said complete redesign
[55:26.640 --> 55:31.680]  of the stores. Yeah. I think so. Um, but that, that does not seem like something that's going to
[55:31.680 --> 55:36.160]  happen before April, at least not nationwide or worldwide. Yeah. Right. And you just like, it's
[55:36.160 --> 55:42.000]  that's not the thing that you can just do in every store overnight. Right. So there's been,
[55:42.000 --> 55:46.640]  you know, speculation, but a lot of Apple stores like the one in Philadelphia has an upstairs that
[55:46.640 --> 55:50.800]  you don't, it's not part of the retail experience. And they, they call it, now they call it a business
[55:50.800 --> 55:57.840]  center. Um, and I know for a fact that like in the Philly one, they do things like, um, like
[55:57.840 --> 56:03.680]  if, uh, company in Philadelphia buys a bunch of Apple stuff, you know, like switch, like an office
[56:03.680 --> 56:08.720]  that's switching from PCs to max, you don't have to buy retail. You can go there. Like Marco
[56:08.720 --> 56:13.920]  is often talked about this on ATP. Um, you know, he, he does it and he's a, you know, one man company,
[56:13.920 --> 56:18.160]  but you started business relationship with them and you can get like developer pricing, you know,
[56:18.160 --> 56:22.880]  like discount pricing. Well, they used to have, and that used to be a whole separate arm. Right.
[56:22.880 --> 56:28.320]  Um, and then they did a reorganization six years ago, seven years ago, something like that,
[56:28.320 --> 56:33.920]  and they moved all that stuff under, um, a retail side. Uh, so like in the Philly one,
[56:33.920 --> 56:37.440]  you go upstairs and they have like area where they could do training. They can have everybody in
[56:37.440 --> 56:40.720]  your company. You can pay, you know, they're, I don't even know if you paid, you know, you, you,
[56:40.720 --> 56:45.200]  you buy like all these max and then you can have like a half a day of training and stuff like that.
[56:45.200 --> 56:49.520]  Um, and they have, you know, it's just like a meeting area because like today with a, when the
[56:49.520 --> 56:54.560]  Philly one opened, I got like a press invitation to just attend to take a look and they gave us like
[56:54.560 --> 56:58.880]  a behind the scenes tour and we went up there. It's just, you know, like exactly what you would think
[56:58.880 --> 57:03.680]  if, if there was a conference room in an Apple store, that's what it looks like. It's a table that
[57:03.680 --> 57:08.720]  looks like one of their tables, but it's big and there's nice chairs and Apple style lighting and
[57:08.720 --> 57:14.960]  et cetera. But anyway, the stores that have that area, clearly that could be repurposed as a
[57:14.960 --> 57:22.400]  quiet, removed place where you spend $4,000 on a watch and try on, you know, multiple straps and
[57:22.400 --> 57:28.000]  stuff like that and see what you like, you know, um, but not all stores have that. The ones in malls
[57:28.000 --> 57:34.000]  shopping malls don't have the luxury of having like a second floor. So maybe, you know, it could be
[57:34.000 --> 57:38.880]  that maybe the, the addition model won't be sold on every Apple store. It might only be sold in
[57:38.880 --> 57:44.000]  certain ones. It might also be the case. I don't, I don't know if they would do it or not,
[57:44.000 --> 57:48.640]  but maybe they're, maybe that's why they hired this tight quarter guy. Maybe they'll sell them in
[57:48.640 --> 57:54.720]  jewelry stores, you know, places that sell Rolexes and no Mingas and, you know, et cetera.
[57:55.280 --> 58:03.360]  I suppose that's possible. That seems odd. Yeah, but the whole idea, because $4,000,
[58:03.360 --> 58:07.360]  dollar. Yeah, but then they're like, they're, they're removing the, you know, they're giving that
[58:08.080 --> 58:12.160]  hands-on experience to somebody else. Right. But, you know, it almost gets you, I mean,
[58:12.160 --> 58:15.840]  obviously they still, they still do that kind of thing, you know, because they sell their phones and
[58:16.880 --> 58:23.680]  carry your stores, et cetera. But, um, that kind of personal touch seems like something they want to
[58:23.680 --> 58:30.240]  keep to themselves. Yeah, I guess you would think so, but I don't know. Yeah. Um, maybe, but maybe
[58:30.240 --> 58:34.400]  where they also also, you know, it's sort of like the way that I think that that's where they
[58:34.400 --> 58:38.560]  want you to buy your iPhone, but they'll also sell it in the carrier stores and they'll sell them at
[58:38.560 --> 58:42.560]  Walmart and they'll sell them at Target. But the problem with those places, though, isn't, is most
[58:42.560 --> 58:49.760]  those people work on commission, don't they? It like Walmart or, you know, no, no, it, the jewelry stores.
[58:49.760 --> 58:53.680]  I would presume so. Yeah. Yeah. And I don't know that they're going to want to, I don't know.
[58:53.680 --> 58:56.960]  That seems like that's a whole another diff, that's a whole different.
[58:58.640 --> 59:02.560]  Like I said, I don't doing, way of doing business that I would be surprised if they want to.
[59:02.560 --> 59:06.960]  Again, I don't know. I love it. Yeah. I really don't know. I feel like it could go either way.
[59:06.960 --> 59:12.720]  I feel like they could sell them only and select Apple stores. I feel like they could sell them,
[59:12.720 --> 59:17.280]  you know, in the watch stores. I don't know. Yeah. Anyway, back to the article, it says,
[59:19.280 --> 59:23.840]  in parts of the world already filled with smartphones, that price may give the Apple watch,
[59:23.840 --> 59:31.360]  the graduation gift appeal that according to Brunner, Brunner is industrial designer who used to
[59:31.360 --> 59:36.000]  be above Johnny. I think at Apple when he started and right, had since gone on to beats,
[59:36.000 --> 59:42.320]  beats consciously sought with its high headphone pricing, but Ives solid gold models,
[59:42.320 --> 59:47.520]  innocently named Apple watch edition are expected to cost many thousands of dollars. John
[59:47.520 --> 59:53.440]  Gruber, an influential Apple blogger, has written that the price may be quote, shockingly high,
[59:53.440 --> 59:58.160]  dot, dot, dot, from the perspective of the tech industry, but perhaps disruptively low
[59:59.120 --> 1:00:05.040]  italics, they even carried my italics over from the perspective of the traditional watch and jewelry
[1:00:05.040 --> 1:00:11.120]  world. I like that I got italics into the New Yorker. They're writers, I don't know if they're allowed
[1:00:11.120 --> 1:00:17.600]  to use. They don't use it much. No, not the way I do. So that's pretty cool. From the perspective
[1:00:17.600 --> 1:00:23.840]  of the traditional watch and jewelry world, I wish that he had quoted my line that when the
[1:00:23.840 --> 1:00:27.920]  price of the edition models is announced, it's going to be the biggest collective
[1:00:27.920 --> 1:00:33.280]  shit fit in the history of shit fits in the tech industry. Because I just feel like I still feel
[1:00:33.280 --> 1:00:37.360]  confident that that's the line that will stand up, stand the test of time as being
[1:00:37.360 --> 1:00:42.320]  prescient about the Apple watch. Yeah, but this may, I mean, that quote makes a point that
[1:00:42.320 --> 1:00:49.200]  is salient to what he's talking about right there. Right. Well, here's here's what I've thought
[1:00:49.200 --> 1:00:54.720]  about this. And you know, because it's my name and my quote, it's very interesting to me because
[1:00:54.720 --> 1:01:01.120]  clearly Ian Parker had complete access to Johnny, I've any talk to a bunch of other people at
[1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:06.960]  Apple, he talked to Tim Cook, he talked to Bob Mansfield, talked to Jeff Williams. And it was
[1:01:06.960 --> 1:01:12.080]  months in the making. It involved, I think it seems as though he traveled to England to talk to
[1:01:12.080 --> 1:01:18.880]  Johnny, Johnny's father. You know, he just sort of thing that the New Yorker is one of the few
[1:01:18.880 --> 1:01:23.840]  publications in the world that can do this because it's expensive. All right, it's expensive to do
[1:01:23.840 --> 1:01:29.920]  this kind of reporting. He had access and he has all sorts of interesting quotes that you don't
[1:01:29.920 --> 1:01:37.840]  typically get from Apple executives. Surely he asked them about watch pricing. And there's nothing
[1:01:37.840 --> 1:01:44.080]  in here. He doesn't say that he did, but he must have, right? And they must have said no comment.
[1:01:44.080 --> 1:01:49.600]  We're not going to talk about pricing at the time. Right. But maybe like, did he come up,
[1:01:49.600 --> 1:01:53.680]  did he quote me because he, you know, he reads me? Yeah, right. Or
[1:01:53.680 --> 1:01:59.280]  possible deniability. Or off the record, did they, was it, you remember with Steve Jobs, we think John
[1:01:59.280 --> 1:02:05.680]  Gruber's piece on this was insightful and not negative. Like maybe they said off the record,
[1:02:05.680 --> 1:02:10.000]  you can't quote us, but we thought John Gruber's piece. Take a look at this one. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:16.640]  We thought his piece on the pricing was insightful and not negative. I really wonder about that.
[1:02:16.640 --> 1:02:24.480]  If, if that was something that they, they said, we can't talk about this, but you should look here.
[1:02:24.480 --> 1:02:32.400]  Yeah. That's certainly possible. Right. That's the, to me, it's, it's the stupidest sort of,
[1:02:32.400 --> 1:02:38.480]  like, four levels of interaction confirmation. But the fact that he had such access to Apple,
[1:02:38.480 --> 1:02:48.560]  and even he points to the addition watches being, you know, quote, many thousands of dollars,
[1:02:49.600 --> 1:02:53.680]  is the, to me, the surest thing. It's more sure than even the sort of back of the envelope
[1:02:53.680 --> 1:02:57.840]  math I've been doing on Darren Fireball with just the price of gold and how much gold is actually
[1:02:57.840 --> 1:03:04.480]  going to be in the thing. More, even more convincing than that is that if Ian Parker, who's so
[1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:12.240]  juiced in says multi many thousands of dollars, it must be. Yeah. I would bet on it, but I keep,
[1:03:12.240 --> 1:03:16.480]  I then I just keep cycling back to what all the naysayers say, which is come on,
[1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:20.640]  they can't charge thousands of dollars for a watch that's going to be outdated a couple of years.
[1:03:21.520 --> 1:03:25.840]  Well, that's the thing. It's the, it's the outdatedness that kind of throws a wrench into it,
[1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:30.640]  because if, if it is the kind of thing that you're going to have to replace in two years,
[1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:37.440]  yeah, then that price becomes, except somewhat untenable, right? Well,
[1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:43.520]  but it's a you and I are, we keep going back to thinking like logical human beings who have
[1:03:43.520 --> 1:03:47.600]  some semblance of, you know, rational control over our finances.
[1:03:49.520 --> 1:03:54.640]  Whereas there's a lot of people who don't, right, which is strange for us, right, right,
[1:03:54.640 --> 1:04:04.400]  like in a weird, perverted sense, if it, if it does have a time, you know, it's a, you know,
[1:04:04.400 --> 1:04:08.960]  a timestamp, you know, a shelf life, if it does have a shelf life of just a few years,
[1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:18.240]  it almost makes it more of a luxury. It might be more ostentatious to buy a $10,000 Apple watch
[1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:24.480]  that's only going to be useful for three years than it would be to buy a $50,000 Rolex that will
[1:04:24.480 --> 1:04:31.200]  live, you know, be, you know, be a value long after you're dead, right? Like the $50,000 Rolex that
[1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:38.560]  becomes a family heirloom is still $50,000 watch, but a $10,000 watch that is going to be going
[1:04:38.560 --> 1:04:48.480]  in the desk drawer in three years is super obnoxious, right? That's right, I had tweeted a few days
[1:04:48.480 --> 1:04:55.200]  ago, like I heard a couple of weeks ago, I guess, like Apple in 2010, it check out this guy who made
[1:04:55.200 --> 1:05:07.360]  that Ryan rich app, then a pause and we should make a watch like that. Like what a jerk and then
[1:05:07.360 --> 1:05:14.480]  like, wait a minute, maybe there's something to do that and it'll after just suddenly just trails
[1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:21.680]  off uncomfortably start buying gold. Oh my God, speaking of which, I hadn't thought about that
[1:05:21.680 --> 1:05:26.880]  guy in a while, but I hope he's making an iPhone app or Apple watch. Oh, you know he is.
[1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:35.760]  Well, and then the article mentioned, you have an addition as well. Well, I have an addition,
[1:05:35.760 --> 1:05:41.600]  and then you suddenly pull your sleeve back and you've got the I am rich app on your watch.
[1:05:41.600 --> 1:05:50.880]  Yeah, one of these. Do you have any great poop poll? I'm trying to find the name. I can't
[1:05:50.880 --> 1:05:55.680]  remember the name of that horrible company that makes the really expensive phones. Oh, I know,
[1:05:55.680 --> 1:06:00.880]  virtue, virtue, yeah, and it mentions, and mentions, virtue in quotes, somebody is saying,
[1:06:00.880 --> 1:06:13.440]  once I guess I've been it, yeah, saying that I think it was him that Johnny was very interested
[1:06:13.440 --> 1:06:19.120]  in that company. Yeah. Yeah. And I don't think it was because he liked their phones. I think,
[1:06:19.680 --> 1:06:26.160]  no, I think the interest is that he enjoyed people were buying. Right. And they're still,
[1:06:26.160 --> 1:06:31.760]  I really thought that they were going away the dodo once the iPhone came out because the whole
[1:06:32.400 --> 1:06:37.440]  idea was that in a world full of crap phones, you could have the best phone because yours was made
[1:06:37.440 --> 1:06:43.840]  with leather and premium materials, even though it was running the same $15 Symbian, you know,
[1:06:44.480 --> 1:06:51.200]  chips and the interior as like a $30 Nokia phone. I mean, it's true. I mean, it would use to,
[1:06:51.200 --> 1:06:55.360]  they've since spun. I mean, Nokia doesn't exist or it doesn't sell phones anymore,
[1:06:55.360 --> 1:07:01.040]  but when virtue was created, they were just, it was like, they were to Nokia, what like,
[1:07:01.040 --> 1:07:07.280]  Lexus is the Toyota or Acura is to Honda. They were like a, you know, premium luxury subsidiary brand,
[1:07:07.280 --> 1:07:14.080]  but they just use the same, you know, like the way that like an Acura TL has like the frame of
[1:07:14.080 --> 1:07:20.320]  like a Honda Accord. It was, you know, like take the case apart and it was exactly the same as
[1:07:20.320 --> 1:07:25.520]  certain, you know, each, each virtue phone corresponded to a corresponding Nokia phone and they just
[1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:31.520]  put it in premium products and sold it for like $5,000, $6,000. And they did have the other thing that
[1:07:31.520 --> 1:07:36.240]  for, I guess that virtue still has is they have like this concierge service where you can
[1:07:37.120 --> 1:07:41.280]  like, I guess what you do is they'll look things up for you on the internet.
[1:07:41.280 --> 1:07:45.600]  Yeah, because your phone can't do it. It really, it really does seem,
[1:07:45.600 --> 1:07:52.560]  it sounds to me when I wrote about it, that it really does the whole idea of the concierge predates
[1:07:54.320 --> 1:07:58.400]  the idea of apps. It's sort of like, you remember how everything in the Flintstones had
[1:07:59.920 --> 1:08:03.680]  like a biological component, you know, like there was always like
[1:08:06.640 --> 1:08:11.440]  like they put something, it's like, they put it in the microwave, but it's the
[1:08:11.440 --> 1:08:16.960]  felt like the microwave was really like a turtle with a couple of matches who had created a fire,
[1:08:16.960 --> 1:08:22.640]  you know, underneath the food. And yeah, you know, everything had like, I think that that's
[1:08:22.640 --> 1:08:26.480]  what the virtue concierge service was. It's like, so like today, it's like if you and I were like,
[1:08:26.480 --> 1:08:31.920]  hey, let's go get a stake and we'd open open table and it would be like, blue, blue,
[1:08:31.920 --> 1:08:36.160]  table for two, eight, 30 tonight, stake, you instead you press this button on your virtue phone and
[1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:41.040]  talk to somebody and be like, I need a table for two at, you know, Morton Steakhouse, eight, 30.
[1:08:42.560 --> 1:08:48.240]  And then they do it. That just sounds terrible.
[1:08:48.240 --> 1:08:52.480]  Really does. But anyway, I thought that, you know, once the iPhone came out and clearly you
[1:08:52.480 --> 1:08:56.240]  were not getting the best phone in the world, you know, the best right in the world was,
[1:08:56.240 --> 1:09:01.040]  you know, 600 dollars that they would quickly go the way of the dodo, but they haven't,
[1:09:01.040 --> 1:09:08.800]  they're still around. They outlasted Nokia. Yeah. And that quote was from Clive Grenier,
[1:09:08.800 --> 1:09:18.560]  who was a friend of lives. We said that it was also said he's always been a bit bling.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:24.320]  Yeah, which is a little worrisome because then you start to worry that maybe it was Steve Jobs
[1:09:24.320 --> 1:09:32.480]  who kind of kept the bling in check. Yeah, I guess, I don't know. Um, let me look it up. I have
[1:09:32.480 --> 1:09:38.640]  some notes from this article. The lines that really stuck out to me. Yeah, I mean, anything
[1:09:38.640 --> 1:09:44.640]  any article that quotes big bug man's field is automatically. He was so, he was so comfortable.
[1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:48.960]  I thought man's field in this at least he comes across it. Whereas Jeff Williams,
[1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:53.760]  this is my favorite line in whole, a whole article. I didn't want to go through and just spoil
[1:09:53.760 --> 1:09:58.800]  it to for people of undering fireball. I just want to be, I think it's so well written. Um,
[1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:04.240]  to be truthful and insanely jealous that he got this access and that he took advantage of it and,
[1:10:04.240 --> 1:10:08.640]  and, you know, came up with such a great article that to me is so accurate. Um,
[1:10:11.760 --> 1:10:20.960]  where does it say here? Is it the pause? Yeah. Yeah. Um, it's such a great sentence. All right.
[1:10:20.960 --> 1:10:27.280]  Here's, is he in Parker writing, I asked Jeff Williams, the senior vice president, if the Apple
[1:10:27.280 --> 1:10:35.120]  Watch seemed more purely Ives than previous company products after a silence of 25 seconds
[1:10:36.080 --> 1:10:46.080]  during which Apple made $50,000 in profit. He said, yes. That is, that is such a, it's two
[1:10:46.080 --> 1:10:52.480]  sentences, but it's the, it's the best paragraph about Apple. Yeah. I've, I've ever read, I think,
[1:10:52.480 --> 1:10:57.200]  because clearly Jeff Williams, I mean, it's, to my knowledge, he's never spoken to the press before,
[1:10:58.320 --> 1:11:05.680]  clearly he is, instead he's been an Apple very long time, you know, since I think late 90s. Um,
[1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:13.440]  and he's obviously not comfortable and rather than, you know, an Apple people, you know, he knows
[1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:17.120]  enough that if he's not going to be comfortable rather than babble on, it'd be better to just
[1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:24.800]  say much. Yeah. Take a 25 second pause before saying yes. And that little aside during which
[1:11:24.800 --> 1:11:33.360]  Apple made $50,000 in profit, I think it's brilliant because it, to me, it's not snide. It's,
[1:11:33.360 --> 1:11:39.600]  it's to me. No, it's, no, it's, it's like filling the pause. Yeah. Yeah. It fills the pause.
[1:11:39.600 --> 1:11:46.720]  And it also just reminds you of why this is of interest, why this company is of interest,
[1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:51.920]  why this company is worth this much attention, you know, it tells you the scale that they're
[1:11:51.920 --> 1:12:00.000]  operating at. Yeah. You know, it's, it's just a nice little reminder of scale, like to fill in
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:06.320]  for, you know, like the Jeopardy theme song. Yeah. There's a, there's a lot in the article.
[1:12:06.320 --> 1:12:12.400]  Yes. That is pretentious. I mean, that comes that can easily come across as pretentious.
[1:12:13.440 --> 1:12:19.120]  All right. Example. Oh, well, um, you know, I've
[1:12:21.360 --> 1:12:25.280]  comments about other people's cars while these driving around with those Bentley.
[1:12:27.120 --> 1:12:31.360]  Yeah. And what's his own our good friend? And the fact, I mean, you know, the simple fact that
[1:12:31.360 --> 1:12:36.320]  they're just, they're crazy rich. I mean, you know, they're all these, you know, most of these guys
[1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:43.680]  are filthy rich. And, you know, he's got a, he's got a plane. He was buying 11 room houses in England,
[1:12:43.680 --> 1:12:48.960]  you know, that were built in the 1700s or 70s. Well, our, our good friend Dan Lyons jumped on this.
[1:12:49.760 --> 1:12:59.360]  Did you see? I did not. You did not see. I've done on, no, I don't think I ate. No, I mean,
[1:12:59.360 --> 1:13:04.000]  I've tried not to pay attention to him anymore. Really? I thought that I, I thought he was
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:10.480]  done. Where's he writing now? Is he? He sounded belly wag, right? Yeah. No. But I thought so
[1:13:10.480 --> 1:13:14.400]  because he wrote that he, his, his back was given him problems and he couldn't blog.
[1:13:16.160 --> 1:13:20.320]  And he's writing a book. And so like a month after he took over value, you got your, you got your
[1:13:20.320 --> 1:13:28.400]  whole thumb off and you still blog. That's true. I got to tell you, if you have, I mean, I, you know,
[1:13:28.400 --> 1:13:33.920]  what I do not like the, the man professionally, I don't, um, but I don't wish injury on anybody.
[1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:38.480]  And so I certainly hope in all sincerity, I do hope that that whatever's wrong with his back gets
[1:13:38.480 --> 1:13:43.680]  better quickly. Um, I don't, I don't wouldn't poke fun at that or any kind of medical problem.
[1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:50.640]  But I do have to say, as somebody who, who blogs professionally, I have to say, if you have to
[1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:57.120]  have a job where you get a bad back injury, this might be the job to have. Like you could keep going.
[1:13:57.120 --> 1:14:02.160]  Yeah. Yeah. I would say my, yeah, I would say my finger injury where I couldn't type.
[1:14:04.240 --> 1:14:10.880]  I would, I would have traded that for a back injury any, any day of the week. Yeah, I would think so.
[1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:17.680]  Anyway, though, he wrote, um, he wrote a piece for Valleywag, Apple design boss, John, John, I've,
[1:14:17.680 --> 1:14:22.240]  this is just, I swear, I think Dan Lyons is a loser. I mean, you call him Jonathan, you can
[1:14:22.240 --> 1:14:26.880]  call him Johnny who calls him John, nobody. And I, as far as I know in the history of the world,
[1:14:26.880 --> 1:14:31.760]  nobody has ever called him John, um, John, I've get chauffeured to work in a Bentley.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:39.360]  Uh, this is crazy. This is his lead. I mean, this is seriously crazy stuff. There is surprisingly
[1:14:39.360 --> 1:14:44.320]  little to be learned about Sir Jonathan, I've in this 17,000 word piece in the New Yorker,
[1:14:44.320 --> 1:14:51.120]  except this the fucker gets driven to work in a Bentley, Mulsan, a car, quote, a car for a head of
[1:14:51.120 --> 1:14:56.720]  state as Ian Parker puts it. How can you say there is surprisingly little to be learned about
[1:14:56.720 --> 1:15:03.280]  this? Oh, my God. There's, there's almost too much to cover. It's almost crazy. Yeah. And that the
[1:15:03.280 --> 1:15:08.080]  one thing you take is amazing, unprecedented access. That one detail is back the Dan Lyons. That one
[1:15:08.080 --> 1:15:12.240]  detail says it all. If you want to know who wields the real power at Apple, look no further,
[1:15:12.240 --> 1:15:18.880]  the Mulsans starting price is a tick over $300,000 and can go higher. Like if you get the special
[1:15:18.880 --> 1:15:24.480]  great proponent refrigerator, I guess. But the price is not the point. The point is the chauffeur,
[1:15:24.480 --> 1:15:29.280]  his name is Jean. There's no word in the article about whether I've makes Jean wear a uniform,
[1:15:29.280 --> 1:15:34.400]  and if so, whether I've designed the uniform himself. And if so, if he selected his driver by
[1:15:34.400 --> 1:15:38.800]  making a few dozen candidates line up and pose to see which one would look best in the uniform
[1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:44.160]  that I've designed and or which ones would agree to have plastic surgery to make themselves look
[1:15:44.160 --> 1:15:50.800]  just so in that uniform and hat. But you get the idea. John Ive is off the fucking rails,
[1:15:50.800 --> 1:15:55.680]  and the only person who could reign him in is no longer among the living. So it's like,
[1:15:56.240 --> 1:16:01.600]  do you know how many people? I know so many people who, in a, who work in San Francisco,
[1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:07.120]  who's part of their job get free Uber. It's like the most, it's like a super common perk nowadays.
[1:16:08.320 --> 1:16:13.360]  Like driving sucks. So there's all, it's like a super common perk as your job hump to get
[1:16:13.360 --> 1:16:18.400]  free Uber. And you just, you know, which is not quite the same as having your own personal
[1:16:18.400 --> 1:16:24.560]  show for 300,000 or car. But guess what, John Ive is a billionaire. Like he owns, you said he
[1:16:24.560 --> 1:16:32.800]  bought Steve Jobs private jet. So if you own a private jet, I think owning a $300,000 car is
[1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:38.160]  actually not, not crazy at all. Yeah. I mean, it makes sense. I mean, it, you know, like I,
[1:16:38.160 --> 1:16:41.440]  the guy earned the money. It makes sense for him to spend it the way he wants to spend it. That's
[1:16:41.440 --> 1:16:47.360]  not really my, I mean, I don't have apparently whatever lions is problem. Yeah. It was worth it.
[1:16:47.360 --> 1:16:56.320]  But it's just that it's just the, you know, the incongruence between that and, you know, some,
[1:16:56.320 --> 1:17:00.960]  you know, the wealth level of many of Apple's customers is a little can be a little bit.
[1:17:00.960 --> 1:17:08.000]  All right. Now here's a kernel of truth and accuracy in, in, in his article. And the next thing
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:11.680]  he says, you know how people say that no way would this have happened if Steve were alive and
[1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:16.000]  running Apple, usually those people are full of shit. But this is one case where it's true. No way
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:21.520]  would Steve have allowed this article to happen. Well, there, that, that sentence I believe is
[1:17:21.520 --> 1:17:26.880]  completely true. No way this article happens if Steve Jobs is still running Apple, although
[1:17:26.880 --> 1:17:31.040]  I'm not 100% sure whether that's because of Steve or whether that's because of Katie,
[1:17:31.920 --> 1:17:36.960]  which we can cycle back to in a second. Yeah. No way would he have allowed one of his employees
[1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:41.680]  to be deified like this. For that matter, no way would John I've have dared to ride around with
[1:17:41.680 --> 1:17:46.240]  a chauffeur when Steve was alive. And no way would Steve have ever been so vulgar as to be driven
[1:17:46.240 --> 1:17:52.640]  around by a chauffeur and a Bentley like a normal, or no, like a modern day pharaoh, Steve drove
[1:17:52.640 --> 1:17:58.720]  his own Mercedes and parked in a handicapped space like a normal sociopath. Well, number one,
[1:17:58.720 --> 1:18:03.520]  Steve Jobs, that's, that's a funny line. Steve Jobs lived in Palo Alto. So he had like a 15 minute
[1:18:03.520 --> 1:18:08.800]  drive to work. Johnny I've lives in San Francisco, which is a shitty drive. It's, I've done it because
[1:18:08.800 --> 1:18:13.600]  I've stayed in San Francisco for Apple events. It's well over an hour, and especially, you know,
[1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:18.080]  of course gets worse at, you know, like the sort of hour where you go to work, because that's
[1:18:18.080 --> 1:18:24.000]  what everybody else is doing. It's a terrible, it's a terrible drive. I mean, like once or twice a year
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:28.640]  for me, it's no big deal. It's something that I would do five or six days a week. It would make you
[1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:35.760]  crazy. He's a billionaire. Like one of the two things that came out of this, that segment of it.
[1:18:35.760 --> 1:18:39.760]  One is that Parker doesn't mention anything about it. And somebody brought this up on Twitter a while
[1:18:39.760 --> 1:18:44.560]  ago, but Apple, I don't know what the legal things are. But for some of their executives,
[1:18:44.560 --> 1:18:50.480]  they reveal in SEC filings what their stock grants are, right? There was the thing with Angela
[1:18:50.480 --> 1:18:55.920]  aren't getting a huge one. You know, like she got a, was well more paid than Tim Cook last year,
[1:18:55.920 --> 1:19:00.480]  because it was like a one time, you know, here's a whole bunch of stock to tempt you to,
[1:19:00.480 --> 1:19:05.760]  you know, come from Burberry to Apple. But somebody pointed out that Johnny Ive has never been
[1:19:05.760 --> 1:19:10.160]  listed in there. Like nobody knows what Johnny Ive makes. Nobody knows how much Apple stock he has.
[1:19:10.160 --> 1:19:17.360]  It's, it's like super secretive. But the article clearly, you know, Parker's article clearly
[1:19:17.360 --> 1:19:23.280]  insinuates that at one point Johnny I was thinking about leaving Apple, at least pondered it,
[1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:30.720]  like when he bought, like you said, the 11 bedroom mansion in England, you know, it's in Apple's
[1:19:30.720 --> 1:19:35.520]  business. I mean, whatever his compensation is, they're keeping it secret. And presumably it is immense.
[1:19:36.880 --> 1:19:44.720]  And well, right? Like he, he might be the, you know, I would guess he's showing
[1:19:44.720 --> 1:19:49.760]  the some signs that it might be immense. Right. I'm guessing that it's, you know, on part,
[1:19:49.760 --> 1:19:54.480]  probably closest only to, you know, Steve Jobs's compensation over the last 15 years,
[1:19:54.480 --> 1:19:56.800]  you know, but it's billions, I would guess.
[1:19:59.200 --> 1:20:03.600]  Yeah, you know, which for a company, I don't understand, but I mean, I can't understand how they,
[1:20:03.600 --> 1:20:08.480]  I mean, they have to file those things with the SEC. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe
[1:20:08.480 --> 1:20:12.560]  I'm wrong. Maybe they've filed it a long time. I don't know. But there is a mission for listeners
[1:20:12.560 --> 1:20:18.000]  of the talk show. If anybody out there can figure out what Johnny Ive's compensation from Apple
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:22.880]  isn't has been. Let me know. But as far as I know, it's not. And I don't know. I don't think they
[1:20:22.880 --> 1:20:28.720]  have to do it for everybody. There might be like certain legally defined positions like the chief
[1:20:28.720 --> 1:20:35.440]  operating officer and the CEO who you have to file it for. But I don't think that's possible.
[1:20:35.440 --> 1:20:42.560]  Why would it be, you know, why would it be required to reveal the salary of him just because
[1:20:42.560 --> 1:20:48.000]  it's titled senior vice president, right? I don't think it is. I don't, there's nothing magical about
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:54.480]  just being the senior vice president. It's just a word, right? They don't have to reveal the
[1:20:54.480 --> 1:21:00.800]  salaries of individual, you know, engineers and designers. Yeah. As far as I know, it's secret.
[1:21:00.800 --> 1:21:06.560]  And I presume immense. It just seems this is a bizarre thing for people to get hung up on.
[1:21:07.120 --> 1:21:10.800]  Plus he was in a car accident a long time ago. I don't forget, was that in the article?
[1:21:10.800 --> 1:21:17.520]  But there was like a Johnny I was in a bad car wreck, like a long time ago, like driving a sports
[1:21:17.520 --> 1:21:26.080]  car across country. Didn't it say this? I don't remember that actually, but I've been reading
[1:21:26.080 --> 1:21:30.320]  this for a while now. So yeah, maybe it's not in this article. It might not be in this article.
[1:21:30.320 --> 1:21:34.400]  But anyway, you know, it just seems, it's almost like the opposite where it seems like it's an
[1:21:34.400 --> 1:21:41.600]  apples interest to, you know, get him a professional driver, not that he's a bad driver, but, you know,
[1:21:41.600 --> 1:21:47.840]  like driving fast, right? Like me, right? You know what? He should get one of those automatic
[1:21:47.840 --> 1:21:54.720]  sticks. Stick that here. Yeah. There you go. I don't know if you can afford it. Yeah.
[1:21:55.920 --> 1:21:59.760]  So if anybody knows Johnny I, if they're very reasonably priced, I'm sure he can afford it.
[1:21:59.760 --> 1:22:06.320]  If anybody knows Johnny, I've passed along the coupon code talk show so that he can save 20 bucks
[1:22:07.840 --> 1:22:09.680]  on his automatic for his Bentley.
[1:22:12.320 --> 1:22:16.560]  And get him a square space too. Now, I was thinking about the whole, this would article would
[1:22:16.560 --> 1:22:19.760]  not have happened if Steve Jobs was around. And I don't, I don't think there's any doubt that it
[1:22:19.760 --> 1:22:25.360]  wouldn't have in it. It's not just that he would job selfishly wouldn't want to let the attention
[1:22:25.360 --> 1:22:29.200]  be on anybody else. He wouldn't have allowed an article like that about himself either.
[1:22:29.200 --> 1:22:34.800]  It just, this wasn't a real, but I do wonder how much of that was Jobs' own,
[1:22:37.680 --> 1:22:44.080]  own choice and how much of it came from Katie Cotton, who was at Apple, you know, she was at
[1:22:44.080 --> 1:22:50.160]  Apple the whole time while Jobs came back. I think she was already there. And, you know, she was
[1:22:50.160 --> 1:22:55.280]  one of the ones who Jobs kept and, you know, obviously got very close to and followed her advice,
[1:22:55.280 --> 1:23:01.520]  you know, very closely, but I wonder whether she drove that no media policy more than even Jobs did
[1:23:01.520 --> 1:23:05.760]  because at least earlier in his career, Jobs maybe wasn't accessible, but he certainly was
[1:23:06.800 --> 1:23:07.840]  occasionally accessible.
[1:23:09.280 --> 1:23:09.600]  Yeah.
[1:23:11.920 --> 1:23:16.160]  Don't know, but that's, it seems like that's a pretty good, there's a good chance that that's what
[1:23:16.160 --> 1:23:16.800]  the case is.
[1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:17.040]  Yeah.
[1:23:17.040 --> 1:23:29.280]  It's, to me, that the existence of this article is, is the biggest sign that Apple is in a new
[1:23:29.280 --> 1:23:38.400]  open, more open attitude and that Apple PR under Steve Dowling is significantly different than
[1:23:38.400 --> 1:23:39.920]  Apple PR under Katie Cotton.
[1:23:40.480 --> 1:23:40.800]  Yeah.
[1:23:42.160 --> 1:23:46.800]  Yeah. I mean, one of the, one of the things that's noted is that, I mean,
[1:23:46.800 --> 1:23:49.760]  it seems like there are several people, well, I mean, I guess this is true for most of them,
[1:23:49.760 --> 1:23:55.280]  like you said, like Williams, but like the designers that they talk to and the, the design lab,
[1:23:56.160 --> 1:23:58.240]  neither of them had spoken to the press before.
[1:23:58.240 --> 1:23:58.400]  No.
[1:24:00.320 --> 1:24:00.560]  No.
[1:24:00.560 --> 1:24:03.200]  It's like they've been, been her medically sealed for.
[1:24:04.320 --> 1:24:05.200]  It's not a teeny.
[1:24:05.200 --> 1:24:10.640]  There's instances in secret because they show up as a team every couple years to pick up awards,
[1:24:10.640 --> 1:24:13.760]  you know, in black tie type things and there's pictures and people know who some of them are,
[1:24:13.760 --> 1:24:16.320]  but yeah, none of them have ever spoken to the press before.
[1:24:16.320 --> 1:24:21.520]  And here they spoke fairly openly, you know, they even talked about a specific instance of,
[1:24:23.920 --> 1:24:30.880]  was that there was a woman, what was her name, who, what did, she would, she had wanted to use
[1:24:30.880 --> 1:24:36.400]  what an orange brown for the interior of the box for the addition and, and then even in hindsight,
[1:24:36.400 --> 1:24:39.040]  now she agrees, oh, that was a terrible, terrible idea.
[1:24:39.040 --> 1:24:41.360]  Yeah.
[1:24:41.360 --> 1:24:45.280]  Um, so that's, there's a, there's a plus that we know, that we know from the article was that,
[1:24:45.280 --> 1:24:48.320]  uh, if you buy the addition, you'll get a cloth to clean it.
[1:24:50.480 --> 1:24:52.560]  Well, it's an extra thousand dollars right there, right?
[1:24:53.440 --> 1:24:53.760]  Sure.
[1:24:54.800 --> 1:24:55.200]  Um,
[1:25:00.080 --> 1:25:01.360]  Akana, what's her name?
[1:25:01.920 --> 1:25:02.080]  Um,
[1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:06.960]  um,
[1:25:08.240 --> 1:25:09.600]  yeah, Apple doesn't use a lot of brown.
[1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:13.040]  Here's one that I thought was interesting.
[1:25:13.040 --> 1:25:16.640]  This is Johnny Ives team team members work 12 hours a day
[1:25:18.320 --> 1:25:20.960]  and can't discuss work with friends. Well, I knew they can't discuss their work,
[1:25:20.960 --> 1:25:23.600]  but 12 hours a day, man, that's crazy.
[1:25:24.480 --> 1:25:25.200]  Am I lazy?
[1:25:25.200 --> 1:25:34.880]  I mean, that seems, that seems nuts. 12 hours a day all the time.
[1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:39.680]  I mean, you get to work at nine and you don't leave until nine p.m.
[1:25:40.560 --> 1:25:42.480]  Oh, man, that seems crazy.
[1:25:43.440 --> 1:25:46.320]  I mean, that's what I, when I worked in Japan, that's what I did.
[1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:48.320]  Man, salary man hours.
[1:25:49.120 --> 1:25:49.680]  That's right.
[1:25:49.680 --> 1:25:56.320]  And then it's what 12, then followed by 12 hours of booze and right?
[1:25:57.040 --> 1:25:58.240]  It's not close.
[1:25:58.240 --> 1:25:59.520]  Suntory time.
[1:25:59.520 --> 1:26:00.400]  It's some nights.
[1:26:00.400 --> 1:26:01.360]  No, not every night.
[1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:02.080]  So some nights.
[1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:03.440]  Suntory time.
[1:26:03.440 --> 1:26:05.600]  Like a bell rings at nine o'clock at night.
[1:26:05.600 --> 1:26:06.480]  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[1:26:06.480 --> 1:26:07.280]  Suntory time.
[1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:09.920]  All of a sudden the ties are loose.
[1:26:09.920 --> 1:26:12.240]  Now we, and now we drink until we throw up on the train.
[1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:12.720]  On the way home.
[1:26:14.240 --> 1:26:14.640]  Uh,
[1:26:15.600 --> 1:26:17.040]  each product has a lead designer,
[1:26:17.040 --> 1:26:20.720]  but almost everyone contributes to every project and shares the credit.
[1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:22.080]  Who had this or that idea?
[1:26:22.080 --> 1:26:22.640]  The team.
[1:26:23.680 --> 1:26:24.320]  Um,
[1:26:25.440 --> 1:26:27.920]  team meetings are held in the kitchen two or three times a week,
[1:26:27.920 --> 1:26:29.440]  and I've encouraged this candor.
[1:26:30.240 --> 1:26:32.960]  We put the product, I know it's pronounced candor.
[1:26:34.080 --> 1:26:35.920]  We put the product out of everything else he said.
[1:26:35.920 --> 1:26:40.000]  Let's say we're talking about something that I've done that's ugly and it'll proportioned
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:42.960]  because believe you me, I can pull some beauties out of the old hat.
[1:26:43.440 --> 1:26:44.000]  It's fine.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:50.080]  And we all do and sometimes we do it repeatedly and we have these seasons of doing it and then
[1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:56.480]  designer Akana says, I had one last week, which one he said, the packaging thing she said.
[1:26:56.480 --> 1:26:57.040]  That's true.
[1:26:57.040 --> 1:26:57.840]  I've said laughing.
[1:26:57.840 --> 1:26:58.480]  It was so bad.
[1:26:59.840 --> 1:27:05.280]  She had proposed that an ultra suede cloth inside the box for a gold version of the Apple
[1:27:05.280 --> 1:27:06.960]  Watch should be an RNG Brown.
[1:27:06.960 --> 1:27:12.000]  I've had objected with comic hyperbole comparing it to the carpeting in a dismal student apartment.
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:16.160]  I'm going to save them, use a spirit Akana then asked.
[1:27:16.160 --> 1:27:17.040]  So you don't like it.
[1:27:23.040 --> 1:27:24.240]  Oh man, what else?
[1:27:24.240 --> 1:27:28.480]  Speaking of, speaking of candor, there was an interesting anecdote or just sort of like a
[1:27:28.480 --> 1:27:33.200]  perspective from I've about Steve Jobs about his
[1:27:33.200 --> 1:27:41.440]  brushiness or how I really want to term it was really more about being trying to be
[1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:47.040]  open and direct rather than being cruel or hurtful.
[1:27:48.080 --> 1:27:53.440]  And yeah, sorry, sorry if it does hurt your feelings, but his whole
[1:27:53.440 --> 1:28:03.920]  you know, I've thought on what Jobs' intent was always to make himself clear
[1:28:05.520 --> 1:28:08.160]  as opposed to like really trying to like stick a knife in somebody.
[1:28:10.640 --> 1:28:12.800]  Yeah, it wasn't about trying to hurt people's feelings.
[1:28:12.800 --> 1:28:14.800]  He wasn't, he wasn't Chevy Chase.
[1:28:14.800 --> 1:28:19.120]  And he often hurt people's feelings, but
[1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:24.000]  it was somebody because he didn't want to waste their time by not getting right to the
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:24.560]  carpet.
[1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:25.440]  Yeah, and that was the other, yeah, right.
[1:28:25.440 --> 1:28:26.080]  And that's the other thing.
[1:28:26.080 --> 1:28:30.720]  It was like he considered it unfair to them and wasted their time.
[1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:30.880]  Right.
[1:28:31.600 --> 1:28:32.800]  Yeah, I thought that was pretty interesting.
[1:28:33.840 --> 1:28:37.360]  One of the other people who Parker clearly had significant access to
[1:28:39.280 --> 1:28:46.560]  was Steve Jobs' wife, Lorraine Powell Jobs, and you know, and you know, I think it backs up
[1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:54.160]  the, you know, everybody has said that that that Johnny and Steve were more than just colleagues.
[1:28:54.160 --> 1:28:58.560]  They were really, really close friends because she clearly knows him very well.
[1:29:00.080 --> 1:29:00.320]  Yeah.
[1:29:03.360 --> 1:29:05.040]  And he was there the day that he died.
[1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:06.640]  Yeah, that's what they said.
[1:29:06.640 --> 1:29:11.200]  Yeah, even if Jobs had rescued, this is following up on your thing about how Jobs had
[1:29:11.200 --> 1:29:15.200]  you know, sort of criticized the way Johnny Ives gave criticism by being too gentle.
[1:29:15.200 --> 1:29:19.120]  Even if Jobs had rescued him from vagueness, it was odd for Ives to bring this up now,
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:23.920]  immediately after I'd learned how to reject a color without causing injury.
[1:29:25.840 --> 1:29:28.000]  Here's a quote from Lorraine Powell Jobs.
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:32.080]  I've seen Johnny deeply frustrated, but I've never seen him rant and rave.
[1:29:32.800 --> 1:29:37.440]  Lorraine Powell Jobs said, and she added laughing that she would not have said the same of her
[1:29:37.440 --> 1:29:46.480]  husband. And it's hard to imagine I've using a disabled parking spot. It's Jobs often did long
[1:29:46.480 --> 1:29:53.680]  before he was unwell. Oh man, what a great article. So many so much great stuff. Let me see
[1:29:53.680 --> 1:29:57.120]  what else I've got in here on it. It's right. It's worth a breakfast. He also did say
[1:29:59.440 --> 1:30:05.360]  about the Isaac Isaac some book. Oh, I regard my regard couldn't be any lower. Yeah, they read
[1:30:05.360 --> 1:30:10.080]  parts of it. And because I do think that's part of it, honestly. And it's, you know, there were
[1:30:10.080 --> 1:30:16.800]  some people when I when I wrote my piece on the Isaacson book, which was scathing as I could get,
[1:30:17.520 --> 1:30:21.840]  I got, you know, some of the you get every kind of feedback, but some of the feedback was of
[1:30:21.840 --> 1:30:28.560]  sounds like sour grapes to me. And that's not the case at all, right? It's like everyone's no chance
[1:30:28.560 --> 1:30:34.880]  there's zero 0 0 0 0 0 0 all the way out zero chance that I was going to be selected to write
[1:30:34.880 --> 1:30:38.400]  Steve Jobs is authorized biography. I'm not a biographer, right? I mean, I don't right. I've never
[1:30:38.400 --> 1:30:45.280]  even written a book. Um, you know, what I've, what I've loved to written a feature article about
[1:30:45.280 --> 1:30:50.320]  him gotten sick, you know, some kind of on the record, you know, spend a day with Steve Jobs,
[1:30:50.320 --> 1:30:54.240]  what I loved it would have been amazing would have been maybe the highlight of my career.
[1:30:54.240 --> 1:30:58.960]  Um, but I didn't trash the book because I, I didn't write it or because I was jealous,
[1:30:58.960 --> 1:31:03.920]  you know, I'd trash it because it was terrible. I thought, especially about his professional life,
[1:31:03.920 --> 1:31:10.400]  and I couldn't be more effusively, uh, uh, praiseful of this Ian Parker New Yorker story,
[1:31:10.400 --> 1:31:17.040]  because I think he's totally nailed a part of Apple that has been largely secret. Yeah.
[1:31:19.600 --> 1:31:22.800]  Let's just take, I'd take the third break before we'll go back to the article. There was more
[1:31:22.800 --> 1:31:27.760]  to talk about, but, uh, let me talk about our third sponsor. And it's another long time good friend
[1:31:27.760 --> 1:31:34.720]  of the show, our buddies at Fracture. You guys know Fracture. They're the place that prints your photos
[1:31:34.720 --> 1:31:42.960]  directly on glass. You send them digital photos. You pick a size. They mail you back a cardboard
[1:31:42.960 --> 1:31:49.520]  thing that you unpack the cardboard and it is a little frame. You can hang it on the wall. It's a
[1:31:49.520 --> 1:31:54.160]  thing you can pop a little, a little thing out the back, a little kickstand, prop it on your desk
[1:31:54.160 --> 1:32:00.880]  or a shelf or a mantle. Um, and the glass piece of glass where the photo is, your photo is
[1:32:00.880 --> 1:32:05.760]  right on the glass. There's not like a piece of paper behind glass. It's right there. You don't
[1:32:05.760 --> 1:32:09.200]  have to go out and buy a frame to put this thing in. You don't have to go out and buy a stand to put
[1:32:09.200 --> 1:32:14.560]  it on all comes right in the packaging. And it's just edge to edge looks impossible because
[1:32:14.560 --> 1:32:18.080]  there's no other way to do that. Like so you have these photos, you can have these photos hanging
[1:32:18.080 --> 1:32:24.640]  on your wall with no visible frame around them, just the photo, edge to edge to edge. And it looks
[1:32:24.640 --> 1:32:28.960]  amazing. It is like the most amazing thing. And there's no way you could have done this with
[1:32:28.960 --> 1:32:32.480]  traditional framing, you know, of a piece of picture behind the frame. There's just no way you
[1:32:32.480 --> 1:32:36.640]  could do it. It looks amazing. People will come in and they'll be like, how did you do that?
[1:32:36.640 --> 1:32:39.680]  And then you'll have to tell them, you have to do the same thing I'm doing now and tell them
[1:32:39.680 --> 1:32:46.880]  all about Fracture. All sorts of sizes, great prices. It's super great. I don't even know how
[1:32:46.880 --> 1:32:51.920]  they charge as little as they do for these things. Great prices. You can just keep going back.
[1:32:51.920 --> 1:32:55.600]  Every time you take good pictures, every time a, you know, go on vacation or something like that,
[1:32:55.600 --> 1:33:00.640]  send a couple pictures to Fracture and get them hang them on a wall. It's such a great way
[1:33:00.640 --> 1:33:08.960]  to enjoy the best photos that you take. Where do you go to find out more? The website is

[1:33:33.200 --> 1:33:39.440]  taken in the last year and you'll thank me for it. My thanks to Fracture for supporting the show.
[1:33:40.400 --> 1:33:46.800]  They have a customer service experience with them, which was fantastic because last
[1:33:48.800 --> 1:33:52.080]  Father's Day, I got a picture for my dad, which was in black and white. It was a picture of my
[1:33:52.080 --> 1:33:55.920]  grandfather that I had taken in like years and years and years ago because you have to go back
[1:33:55.920 --> 1:34:01.600]  that far. I have to go back that far to find a good picture that I've taken. But it was
[1:34:01.600 --> 1:34:06.640]  black and white and I wanted to get it on Fracture. I went to their site and I was having trouble
[1:34:06.640 --> 1:34:09.440]  finding anything that wasn't black and white and I wanted to make sure they could do black and
[1:34:09.440 --> 1:34:15.280]  white and that it would look good. They got the one we got right back to me and she said,
[1:34:15.280 --> 1:34:20.640]  actually, here are some on the site and she pointed me to where I could see those and said,
[1:34:20.640 --> 1:34:27.040]  you know, no worry. Looks great and my dad just loved it. It's really, so definitely a good company.
[1:34:27.040 --> 1:34:34.880]  Good people. Yeah. Yeah. It was a great phrase. One of my notes is this. I think it's so
[1:34:34.880 --> 1:34:38.480]  astute. There's nothing to do with Johnny. I was about to steal jobs, but he's talking about how
[1:34:38.480 --> 1:34:41.920]  Johnny doesn't speak in public. Doesn't have to speak in public. This isn't comfortable, but he
[1:34:41.920 --> 1:34:51.200]  does the videos. It appears in those videos. Such videos used to punctuate jobs is on stage message.
[1:34:51.200 --> 1:34:56.480]  In the absence of jobs, they carry the message. Apple's current leaders aren't without public
[1:34:56.480 --> 1:35:02.880]  speaking skills, but they can't match jobs as charisma, which was fortified by a hint of menace.
[1:35:03.600 --> 1:35:14.160]  I love that phrase. Like there was that is sort of a hint of menace is absolutely part of Steve
[1:35:14.160 --> 1:35:21.600]  Jobs is on stage charisma. It was it's absolutely true. And their performances can evoke the
[1:35:21.600 --> 1:35:26.720]  awkward informality, the dancing and lanyards of a corporate retreat. It's a little bit of his
[1:35:26.720 --> 1:35:35.120]  anger there towards. I don't know. Shiller and Federighi, I guess. Yeah. I guess.
[1:35:37.600 --> 1:35:41.600]  Sort of the humor maybe. I don't know. But I love that hint of menace about jobs.
[1:35:42.640 --> 1:35:45.840]  Such a great, such an astute turn of phrase to describe that.
[1:35:45.840 --> 1:35:52.560]  There's a lot of talk about the digital about the crown. Oh, definitely.
[1:35:54.480 --> 1:36:00.800]  And how they kind of came up with that. And you brought this issue up the other day,
[1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:08.320]  I think that most of the other smartwatches have not had that. They've all relied on
[1:36:08.320 --> 1:36:16.240]  touch input on the screen. Right? Yes. Yeah. Which is something I hadn't really noticed.
[1:36:17.680 --> 1:36:23.120]  Yeah. And there's a bunch of them have a button at the crown traditional crown position,
[1:36:23.920 --> 1:36:26.960]  but it's just a button. It's like a thing you used to wake the phone or to
[1:36:26.960 --> 1:36:32.800]  activate something. It's not something you twist. Like the Apple one, there's no way to use
[1:36:32.800 --> 1:36:37.600]  the watch without using spinning the crown repeatedly. And I'm telling you, I've said this before,
[1:36:37.600 --> 1:36:41.120]  I'll say it again. Once these things come out and everybody can try one, it's going to be,
[1:36:41.120 --> 1:36:45.760]  there's going to be like an entire week of people talking about how it feels to turn that crown,
[1:36:45.760 --> 1:36:53.600]  because it is, it's, it's the word legubrious. Did you, did you see Dan's Dan Morin's piece on
[1:36:53.600 --> 1:36:57.440]  six colors about the color? Yeah. I even linked to it inside the crown. Yeah. I linked to that.
[1:36:57.440 --> 1:37:03.200]  Yeah. That's a curious, another like head scratcher. We talked about it on our podcast is very,
[1:37:03.200 --> 1:37:07.280]  very weird. I mean, when he pointed that out, I was like, Oh, my God, what the heck is going on there?
[1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:11.680]  All right. So if you buy so many shots, so many shots show it with the color that matches
[1:37:12.640 --> 1:37:18.000]  I can confirm that the ones that the hands on all were like that. So if you buy like the addition
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:27.280]  model with a red leather strap has a red matching red insert in the flat part of the digital crown.
[1:37:27.280 --> 1:37:34.400]  And if you buy the addition with a white band, it has a white insert. But the thing that makes it
[1:37:34.400 --> 1:37:39.200]  so confounding is that they also talk about how easy it is to take the bands on and off,
[1:37:39.200 --> 1:37:42.240]  which makes you instantly think, Oh, well, then it's, you know, they're going to make money.
[1:37:42.240 --> 1:37:46.160]  And it's not going to match anymore. Right. You're going to, you know, buy, you know, people with
[1:37:46.160 --> 1:37:50.400]  money to burn again and buy multiple bands. And, you know, what else is the point of making it so
[1:37:50.400 --> 1:37:56.000]  easy to swap them? But then the digital insert won't match them, which seems curious, like, why
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:59.120]  not just make it a neutral color. Why not just keep it, you know, gold? Yeah.
[1:37:59.120 --> 1:38:07.040]  And then the sport watches neutral. It's just the color of the body. Is it in the same and the
[1:38:07.040 --> 1:38:12.640]  same with the with the stainless one? Right. Yeah, stainless one. Yeah. So it's just the addition.
[1:38:12.640 --> 1:38:17.760]  Yeah. And it just seemed and it, I don't know, it just seems weird. I don't know. And there's
[1:38:17.760 --> 1:38:20.960]  people on Twitter who are saying, well, maybe you pop those things out too and you can pop them in.
[1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:24.080]  But that seems like that seems finicky. I don't know.
[1:38:24.080 --> 1:38:33.520]  Yeah. Her name was Jodie Akana, J-O-D-Y Akana, who is in her 30s and that she, this is,
[1:38:33.520 --> 1:38:37.920]  see, this is a sort of detail that Apple never would have revealed before. She's in Johnny's
[1:38:37.920 --> 1:38:43.360]  I've group and she's unusual be for having a declared specialty color.
[1:38:46.960 --> 1:38:50.240]  Yeah. Crazy. Like all she does is pick colors.
[1:38:50.240 --> 1:38:56.800]  That's sort of like our future role where we're all we're going to do is pick fake Apple
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:38:58.960]  rumor projects.
[1:39:04.720 --> 1:39:08.560]  We'll have a great lab. Oh my god. It'd be so great. We'll have like, we'll get one of those jet
[1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:14.960]  packs like Connery used in Thunderbolt. Right. See if we can get people to say that we're working
[1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:22.240]  on it on it. I'll also be more, I'll also be more of a bar than a lab. It'll just be a bar.
[1:39:22.960 --> 1:39:34.960]  Let's face it. Oh, we can't we can't let this pass. And I've once sat next to JJ Abrams
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:40.320]  at a boozy dinner party in New York and made what Abrams were called as, quote,
[1:39:40.320 --> 1:39:47.280]  very specific suggestions about the design of lightsabers. Abrams told me that Star Wars,
[1:39:47.280 --> 1:39:52.480]  the Force Awakens would reflect those thoughts, but he wouldn't say how after the release of
[1:39:52.480 --> 1:39:57.600]  the film's first trailer, which featured a fiery new lightsaber with a cross guard and a resemblance
[1:39:57.600 --> 1:40:03.120]  to a burning crucifix, I asked I've about his contribution. It was just a conversation he said,
[1:40:03.120 --> 1:40:08.960]  then explained that, although he'd said nothing about cross guards, he had made a case for unevenness.
[1:40:08.960 --> 1:40:14.160]  I thought it would be interesting if it were a little less precise and just a little bit more
[1:40:14.160 --> 1:40:21.680]  spitty. A redesigned weapon could be more analog and more primitive. And I think in that
[1:40:21.680 --> 1:40:28.000]  way, somehow more ominous. That's brilliant. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it sounds like, you know,
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:35.440]  and it almost makes me wonder how self-serving it is, but it sounds like everything that you
[1:40:35.440 --> 1:40:39.360]  like about that lightsaber, everything that most people seem to like, I thought that lightsaber
[1:40:39.360 --> 1:40:45.760]  is what Johnny said. Yeah. Not the cross guard, which most people don't seem to like,
[1:40:45.760 --> 1:40:50.960]  I'm not bothered by it. I'm not bothered by it either, but, you know, all right, a lot of people are
[1:40:52.240 --> 1:40:58.400]  spitty dance, a little bit more spitty. And it would make it, you know, less digital more analog
[1:40:58.400 --> 1:41:05.200]  would make it more ominous is so totally true. And it's so precise, right? Like clearly,
[1:41:05.200 --> 1:41:10.400]  I think part of his gift is that he's able to communicate his feeling so well,
[1:41:11.360 --> 1:41:18.160]  you know, spitty is such a great word for that. Oh, it's great. So great. Truly great. Another
[1:41:18.160 --> 1:41:23.440]  thing that came out of this was that the video that unveiled the watch that Johnny I've narrates,
[1:41:23.440 --> 1:41:29.120]  that he directed it effectively. I mean, I'm sure not single-handedly, but that it was, you know,
[1:41:29.120 --> 1:41:36.320]  that he had a huge, you know, with Parker there that he spent a lot of time in the room editing
[1:41:36.320 --> 1:41:44.640]  the video. It was pretty good. Yeah. Just not something I would have expected that Johnny
[1:41:44.640 --> 1:41:51.840]  I've had to direct hand in. I mentioned an article. The thing I took away from when I linked
[1:41:51.840 --> 1:41:55.680]  to it, the one thing I did mention is that it does seem the article does make it seem like Johnny
[1:41:55.680 --> 1:42:00.640]  I've spread very thin because he's obviously in charge of all Apple products. One of the products
[1:42:00.640 --> 1:42:06.880]  are coming out with the Apple Watch is their first major new product in the post jobs era. And
[1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:11.600]  Johnny I was clearly feeling the pressure on that at the article makes clear. I mean, I,
[1:42:11.600 --> 1:42:15.920]  you know, who would have thought other? I mean, be worried some if it were anything, if he was
[1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:21.280]  like not sure a lot about it, but it's a lot on the shoulders. He's working with Angela Arnt's
[1:42:21.280 --> 1:42:29.680]  on a redesign of all the Apple stores. And he's like the point person leading the directing
[1:42:29.680 --> 1:42:34.720]  the assembly of the new Apple headquarters. I was going to say construction, but they even
[1:42:34.720 --> 1:42:38.320]  make a point that the way that they're putting it together is more assembly than construction.
[1:42:41.440 --> 1:42:47.520]  So he's got a worldwide headquarters, you know, presumably their headquarters for the next 50
[1:42:47.520 --> 1:42:54.240]  years, a landmark building. He's got all the Apple stores. He's got the watch and all the other
[1:42:54.240 --> 1:42:58.640]  products that they have. Seems and he's taken over software design.
[1:42:59.360 --> 1:43:03.120]  When he works 12 hours, he works 12 hours a day job. Well, they don't say Johnny works 12 hours a day.
[1:43:03.840 --> 1:43:09.360]  I mean, he works a lot more than that. It seems as though he must work more than 12 hours a day.
[1:43:11.920 --> 1:43:15.280]  I don't know that the whole team needs to work 12 hours a day, but yeah, it just seems like all
[1:43:15.280 --> 1:43:19.040]  those, all those executives are just, I mean, they're basically, you know, I'm sure they take time
[1:43:19.040 --> 1:43:23.840]  off of their family and stuff. But I mean, they're kind of, they're kind of on all the time.
[1:43:23.840 --> 1:43:29.680]  Yeah. No, I think they all have a lot on their plate and it does, you know, I don't have no doubt
[1:43:29.680 --> 1:43:39.440]  that all of them are just naturally hardworking. Yeah. It makes a few passing remarks about how,
[1:43:39.440 --> 1:43:46.240]  you know, he's not always right. Yeah. And I don't, I mean, it doesn't,
[1:43:48.960 --> 1:43:51.840]  doesn't mention the newsstand icon specifically, but, you know,
[1:43:53.920 --> 1:43:57.360]  things like that. They did bring up a Parker did bring up the hockey puck mouse,
[1:43:58.240 --> 1:44:03.200]  which is something many people always go back to. And I always have to mention, I always have to
[1:44:03.200 --> 1:44:10.320]  mention that my wife loved that mouse, loved it. She used it years after her purple eye
[1:44:10.320 --> 1:44:14.720]  mac had bit the dust. She was still using the purple hockey puck mouse with whatever computer she had
[1:44:14.720 --> 1:44:20.160]  next said there are people who like that mouse. I mean, my wife has relatively small hands. That
[1:44:20.160 --> 1:44:25.200]  might be why. I don't know. I thought I had never met one, but I guess I have a hockey puck mouse
[1:44:25.200 --> 1:44:32.160]  like her. Yeah. I had a plan. I mean, I had, I got one of those plastic things that you clipped on
[1:44:32.160 --> 1:44:37.360]  it just to make it feel like a real house. Why didn't you just buy a new mouse? I don't know.
[1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:41.920]  It was an idiot. It was cheaper. It was cheaper than buying a new mouse. You know, it was like,
[1:44:41.920 --> 1:44:46.640]  it was like a couple bucks or something. It's like the mouse part worked fine. It was just the
[1:44:46.640 --> 1:44:50.480]  fact that I could never tell, you know, like just reaching out blindly and grabbing it, you could
[1:44:50.480 --> 1:44:56.720]  never tell which way it was pointed. You have to fiddle with it to get it to, to be
[1:44:56.720 --> 1:45:02.240]  or another right one. Yeah. Here's Bob Mansfield. This to me, again, this is insight into the
[1:45:02.240 --> 1:45:06.880]  company that to me is unprecedented. And it just drops out in the middle of random paragraph in
[1:45:06.880 --> 1:45:12.720]  the early article. Bob Mansfield then closely involved in the watch product project. And number
[1:45:12.720 --> 1:45:16.640]  one, did we know that before? Do we know that Bob Mansfield was with a special project?
[1:45:16.640 --> 1:45:21.840]  I know. Well, I mean, no, I mean, I think you could, you could guess that right. I don't think it
[1:45:21.840 --> 1:45:28.880]  was ever stated explicitly anymore. Said that I was role was to be, quote, himself and Steve,
[1:45:29.840 --> 1:45:37.040]  end quote, combined. Yet I've still had to make a case to Apple. And that's another way,
[1:45:37.040 --> 1:45:41.760]  I have to think that Johnny I have to spread thin. In addition to just listing all the
[1:45:41.760 --> 1:45:47.040]  projects he's working on, it's explicitly stated here by Bob Mansfield that his, he sees his new
[1:45:47.040 --> 1:45:55.360]  role is to be what used to be Steve and Johnny. Two geniuses is one, right? It's like, you know,
[1:45:55.360 --> 1:46:00.480]  it's like, if the Beatles got back together and Paul had to be John Ann Paul, right? I mean,
[1:46:00.480 --> 1:46:05.440]  it's more it, but I'm not even making a joke. I mean, it's, it wouldn't you feel if you've
[1:46:05.440 --> 1:46:11.840]  personally felt that it was your job to, to be Steve Jobs in addition to everything you, yourself
[1:46:11.840 --> 1:46:18.800]  had already done. I mean, that's, that's a burden. I mean, that is a, that is a serious, serious
[1:46:18.800 --> 1:46:28.000]  weight on your psyche. It wasn't that he met a, this is about whether or not they should do a watch
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:33.040]  and that Mansfield recalled, quote, a lot of resistance. It wasn't clear how the company would
[1:46:33.040 --> 1:46:38.400]  display such things and stores. There were also concerns about creating a divide between wealthy
[1:46:38.400 --> 1:46:43.280]  and less wealthy customers. As Mansfield said, Apple wants to build products for everybody,
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:48.560]  but I've won the argument and in 2013, the company announced the high level appointments of
[1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:55.920]  Angela aren't blah, blah, blah, blah, and the other luxury people. You know, I don't think,
[1:46:55.920 --> 1:47:01.920]  I think that's sort of, that's exactly what I, my vague second, thirdhand understanding of the
[1:47:01.920 --> 1:47:06.640]  story behind the watches and the story of Johnny Hives role in the post job's Apple, but here's,
[1:47:06.640 --> 1:47:11.120]  you know, Bob Mansfield confirming it on the record in New Yorker, you know, that there will,
[1:47:11.120 --> 1:47:17.040]  you know, and exactly what everybody thinks, like just, you know, Apple fans clucking on Twitter,
[1:47:17.040 --> 1:47:22.960]  you know, that isn't it weird that Apple is making this product that is so crazy differentiated,
[1:47:22.960 --> 1:47:29.040]  you know, by a factor of 10 in price between this 350 sport and the multi-thousand dollar thing,
[1:47:29.040 --> 1:47:34.080]  and that there were people in Apple who, it would, you know, at high level with an Apple,
[1:47:34.080 --> 1:47:38.160]  like decision making level with an Apple who obviously said the same things and had the same
[1:47:38.160 --> 1:47:43.600]  concerns. And they're, I don't think they're wrong. I think those are valid concerns. I don't
[1:47:43.600 --> 1:47:47.760]  think they're wrong to do it, but it is something that you should be concerned about. Yeah,
[1:47:47.760 --> 1:47:53.040]  well, something to keep an eye on, you know, and it's, it, it, in a sense, you know, and, and,
[1:47:53.040 --> 1:47:59.120]  you know, it, it would have fallen on a Johnny Hives shoulders, no matter what, the success,
[1:47:59.120 --> 1:48:03.280]  or if it's not a success of Apple Watch is going to fall on the shoulders anyway,
[1:48:03.280 --> 1:48:08.240]  but with this article, it's, there's no offense or butts about it, right? The article,
[1:48:08.240 --> 1:48:16.480]  I mean, almost expressly just says the watch is Johnny Hives thing. Well, the certainly the
[1:48:16.480 --> 1:48:23.120]  luxury aspect of it. Yeah, definitely. I've heard that too. That's like, it's just, I don't know,
[1:48:23.120 --> 1:48:27.040]  third hand, fourth hand, but I have heard that very specifically, the gold thing
[1:48:27.600 --> 1:48:33.120]  met a lot of resistance within Apple and that like from all sorts of places, you know,
[1:48:33.120 --> 1:48:39.360]  um, because I even like the legal department had to get involved in, you know, you know, you
[1:48:39.360 --> 1:48:44.400]  can't call it 18 carat gold unless it's truly 18 carat gold and, you know, it's all sorts, you know,
[1:48:44.400 --> 1:48:51.440]  there's, it was a huge, huge thing within Apple and it was Johnny, you know, said trust me,
[1:48:51.440 --> 1:48:58.000]  more or less. Yeah. You know, who's not mentioned in here at all? Who is not mentioned in here,
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:04.880]  you know, it's got four still. No, not mentioned at all. Yeah. I think obliquely mentioned
[1:49:05.920 --> 1:49:11.440]  a couple times. Yeah. And I think there's a couple references to like, and I think Mansfield
[1:49:12.320 --> 1:49:20.800]  makes, makes some reference to how he, Johnny could get along with other people better than he could.
[1:49:20.800 --> 1:49:25.600]  Yeah. Well, no, that he ran interference with Steve, right? Isn't that what Mansfield said?
[1:49:25.600 --> 1:49:35.440]  Yeah. Yeah. But, but he also just said like people who are, um, you know, kind of more
[1:49:35.440 --> 1:49:45.840]  bruscular. Yeah. Here we go. So, uh, this is Bob Mansfield, a former senior hardware engineer at
[1:49:45.840 --> 1:49:52.720]  Apple who is now semi retired recently described the peak that some colleagues that PI QUE,
[1:49:52.720 --> 1:49:59.760]  that some colleagues felt about Ives privileged access as he put it, quote, there's always some,
[1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:05.680]  always going to be someone vying for dad's attention. But Mansfield was grateful for Ives
[1:50:05.680 --> 1:50:12.400]  cool handling of a CEO who was, quote, not the easiest guy to please. Mansfield view was,
[1:50:12.400 --> 1:50:16.480]  Johnny puts up with a lot and as a result of him doing it, people like me don't have to.
[1:50:16.480 --> 1:50:24.640]  Yeah. Yeah. You get the feeling that that would, with four stalled personality wise. And again,
[1:50:24.640 --> 1:50:29.200]  you know, I think there's a personality more than anything else. I don't think, you know, I think it
[1:50:29.200 --> 1:50:34.320]  was more than whether you think that, that game center should have a felt background or, you know,
[1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:39.040]  a plain one. It's the personality. And I've, you know, wasn't it Mansfield who the word was that
[1:50:39.040 --> 1:50:42.560]  Mansfield was like, I'm not, I'm not taking a meeting with this guy anymore. Like,
[1:50:42.560 --> 1:50:47.120]  yeah, that's what I thought. Yeah. Yeah. Or like he wouldn't take a meeting with him in less
[1:50:47.120 --> 1:50:50.960]  like jobs or something. And I thought that was one of the reasons why he had basically announced his
[1:50:50.960 --> 1:50:55.760]  retirement and then decided to come back or cook or like limited. Like he won't, he won't be in a room
[1:50:55.760 --> 1:51:00.000]  with Scott forced all in less, was in the room and cook. Yeah. It was like, I can't, you know, I cannot
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:07.200]  have this. You know, yeah, the extra Tim Cook might have some stuff to do. He might be busy. Tim Cook
[1:51:07.200 --> 1:51:17.280]  might work 12 hours a day. 12, Tim Cook might work 12 hours a morning. There was a great quote
[1:51:17.280 --> 1:51:24.560]  from, there's a guy needs a watch. There was a great quote here from Cook, which to me shows,
[1:51:24.560 --> 1:51:29.120]  I think it's one of the loosest quotes I've ever heard from Tim Cook, because Tim Cook is,
[1:51:30.320 --> 1:51:36.720]  he's like a machine with talking points. You know, he, he, I think he's always very honest.
[1:51:36.720 --> 1:51:42.480]  I'd really do. I think he's very honest and very sincere, but it's so hard to see him in an
[1:51:42.480 --> 1:51:47.680]  interview and not see that everything he said he's already anticipated. You know, the Charlie
[1:51:47.680 --> 1:51:52.640]  Rose interview is the closest because it was the longest, but he says here in the New Yorker story,
[1:51:52.640 --> 1:51:58.160]  under Cook, Apple is experimented with a softer, less neurotic image and has, among other things,
[1:51:58.160 --> 1:52:03.680]  strive to improve its performance as a proxy employer of overseas factory workers. It's determined
[1:52:03.680 --> 1:52:09.280]  to make the case as Cook puts it, that the company's leaders shouldn't be thought of as,
[1:52:09.280 --> 1:52:18.560]  quote, greedy bastards looking for more money. But then in reference to the, the new campus
[1:52:18.560 --> 1:52:23.920]  Parker points out a private walled garden costing an estimated five billion dollars may not catch
[1:52:23.920 --> 1:52:29.920]  this mood. But I do think, I think that's such a loose quote from Cook, and I think he've
[1:52:29.920 --> 1:52:35.120]  truly means it, but it's like, you know, I think in Tim Cook's world, bastards is a really,
[1:52:35.120 --> 1:52:43.360]  that's a hard word. Yeah, I don't. He drops a, does that think he drops an F bomb in their
[1:52:43.360 --> 1:52:52.800]  someplace to cook? I thought so. I don't think so. Really? No, don't he? Green your sense of,
[1:52:52.800 --> 1:52:58.160]  no, there's the only F server. Okay. And when he first, you know, I guess not, I guess.
[1:52:58.160 --> 1:53:03.200]  Johnny I when he first met the first time he met Steve Jobs when he visited the design studio
[1:53:03.200 --> 1:53:08.880]  and saw that they had cool stuff, but that they hadn't been able to ship it told Johnny,
[1:53:08.880 --> 1:53:18.480]  I fuck, you've not been very effective. Have you? What a great article. Honest to God,
[1:53:18.480 --> 1:53:22.400]  everybody out there, if you have not read this article yet, you are out of your minds because I
[1:53:22.400 --> 1:53:27.680]  do, if you have enough interest in Apple to listen to this podcast, this article is so
[1:53:27.680 --> 1:53:36.480]  right up your alley. I'm going to just assume that everybody. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the thing,
[1:53:36.480 --> 1:53:41.920]  like one of the things is you could, it can come across snooty or it can come across classes
[1:53:41.920 --> 1:53:48.560]  or it can come across a leadist or however you want to put it. But the thing that definitely
[1:53:48.560 --> 1:53:54.080]  shines through is simply how much he cares about design and how much he cares about what he's
[1:53:54.080 --> 1:54:00.080]  doing there. Yeah. And I think, and you know, I think the watch is a sign of that,
[1:54:02.560 --> 1:54:10.800]  that and Cook has alluded to this. I think Cook has alluded to it very broadly, but that Apple
[1:54:10.800 --> 1:54:19.520]  is about not about making computers. It's about making good things that make people's lives better.
[1:54:19.520 --> 1:54:25.760]  And that could be anything in the long run, like in terms of, and I think just like Tim Cook,
[1:54:25.760 --> 1:54:30.640]  I think Johnny I've, and I, you know, as I've written about Steve Jobs, you know, that his greatest
[1:54:30.640 --> 1:54:37.760]  creation was the company, Apple itself, not one of the products, that is an institution, you know,
[1:54:37.760 --> 1:54:44.240]  it's the future, who knows what they'll be making, you know, but that he cares very deeply about
[1:54:44.240 --> 1:54:50.800]  creating a, you know, a system and a pattern that they can get involved in, you know, who knows
[1:54:50.800 --> 1:54:59.200]  what in the future. Yeah. And it contrasts with, is it, if that was Brunner, yeah, Brunner,
[1:55:01.040 --> 1:55:05.440]  soon after the iPhone debuted, Brunner said ammunition, which is the company that was working
[1:55:05.440 --> 1:55:12.480]  at, was approached by a very large Korean body to create a touchscreen competitor. They wanted us
[1:55:12.480 --> 1:55:19.120]  to do it in six weeks left. We were like, you know, realized this was years, this was years of a
[1:55:19.120 --> 1:55:23.280]  lot of very good people. I wonder what company it was. I guess it, I really don't, I really
[1:55:23.280 --> 1:55:29.440]  hard to say. I guess it, I guess it could have been LG, but it's pretty clearly Samsung. Yeah,
[1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:35.040]  they do talk, they talk about LG earlier. Yeah, it doesn't. We would like something like this,
[1:55:35.040 --> 1:55:42.800]  and we would like it, we would like it in six weeks. Let's just slap something again.
[1:55:42.800 --> 1:55:47.680]  Oh, all right, last thing, I'll just look at apples, I'm looking at apples executive bios. So
[1:55:47.680 --> 1:55:56.640]  there's 14 SVPs or above, they talked to cook, and they talked to obviously Johnny, and they
[1:55:56.640 --> 1:56:01.280]  talked to Jeff Williams, but they're, and who knows, maybe he talked to other people and they're
[1:56:01.280 --> 1:56:09.040]  just quoted to make it. But no, Eddie Q, no Federigi, no Luca Maestri, Luca. What is he? CFO,
[1:56:09.040 --> 1:56:13.920]  and there's no right. Talk to you. Dan Richey gets mentioned Richeo,
[1:56:13.920 --> 1:56:17.360]  our engineering where they were talking, but it wasn't a quote. It was just like a story about
[1:56:17.360 --> 1:56:23.280]  in it, you know, like an engineering hassle. And no Bruce Sewell, but why would you talk to a lawyer?
[1:56:23.280 --> 1:56:28.160]  God, Bruce Sewell's probably just sweating over this article. God, Bruce Sewell, you want
[1:56:28.160 --> 1:56:35.200]  another to do with it? Bruce Sewell told me, go fuck yourself. You better watch what you write.
[1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:45.680]  And no Shiller. But I'm not surprised by any of that. I am a little surprised by the talk to Jeff
[1:56:45.680 --> 1:56:55.520]  Williams. Yeah. I'm not quite sure why operations would rate and, you know, marketing or software engineering
[1:56:55.520 --> 1:57:00.800]  one. Yeah. Well, I mean, like who knows, he maybe talked to Federigi extensively and just
[1:57:00.800 --> 1:57:05.520]  I mean, maybe he felt that he was getting, I mean, the Williams anecdotes are interesting. Yeah.
[1:57:06.240 --> 1:57:12.640]  Just, I mean, because of the way he's reticent to talk and, and then, you know, maybe you talk
[1:57:12.640 --> 1:57:16.720]  to Shiller and he just felt like he was getting sprayed in the face with a fire hose of
[1:57:17.840 --> 1:57:19.680]  marketing stuff. Yeah, maybe could be.
[1:57:19.680 --> 1:57:25.360]  Anyway, that feels like a show. John Moltz, I thank you.
[1:57:26.720 --> 1:57:28.720]  People can get all the molds they want.
[1:57:30.320 --> 1:57:35.040]  But driving by my house, driving by his house, look for his new car. Don't key it up.
[1:57:36.480 --> 1:57:38.160]  Please, please do not cue my car.
[1:57:39.760 --> 1:57:43.520]  And you got the At Moltz Twitter account and you've got your
[1:57:43.520 --> 1:57:50.480]  very nice website dot net, very nice website dot net. And now you're on about eight different
[1:57:50.480 --> 1:57:57.120]  podcasts. You've got working on another one. That's actually a shocker there. Are you kidding me?
[1:57:57.120 --> 1:58:02.080]  Yeah, right. Are you kidding me? How do you do it? I'm I'm exhausted doing this one show a week.
[1:58:02.080 --> 1:58:14.640]  Exhale. Did I have it? Well, this is two shows worth. Have I mentioned that? I'm apparently not a very hard worker.
[1:58:14.640 --> 1:58:18.400]  This should be like a video show. You saying that you're going to do another podcast. I've slumped.
[1:58:18.400 --> 1:58:20.960]  I visibly slumped. It was like the air got let out of me.
[1:58:20.960 --> 1:58:22.400]  Well, I don't have to do the show.
[1:58:22.400 --> 1:58:27.360]  So, okay, well, so my other two podcasts, my the trick turning this car around and the rebound,
[1:58:27.360 --> 1:58:32.800]  both of them are like less than an hour. Okay, so that's, you know, that's your talk show right
[1:58:32.800 --> 1:58:36.880]  there we go. Because this is approaching two hours now. And then the other one is just something
[1:58:36.880 --> 1:58:41.280]  that I'm doing for fun that'll never make any money. So, it will never have advertisers. It's
[1:58:41.280 --> 1:58:45.520]  just like, it's going to be hanging out with, uh, if it ever comes through fruition, it's going
[1:58:45.520 --> 1:58:49.920]  to be hanging out with a couple of dudes talking about comic book TV shows.
[1:58:49.920 --> 1:58:57.680]  Yes, just for you. We'll have you on.
[1:58:57.680 --> 1:59:27.520]  All right, that's great. I'm hanging out.
