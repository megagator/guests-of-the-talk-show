[00:00.000 --> 00:04.480]  we have a theme here's the thing oftentimes the way i run this show we don't necessarily have a
[00:04.480 --> 00:09.200]  theme we might have a list of talking points but we have a theme i'll just spoil it it's the metaverse
[00:10.320 --> 00:14.800]  i think we can fill a whole talk show with it yeah but we have to we have to establish i mean
[00:14.800 --> 00:20.880]  we have this luxurious amount of time because we usually record in 15-minute segments and we
[00:20.880 --> 00:25.760]  already devoted two episodes of dithering to the metaverse but i think we just have to establish
[00:25.760 --> 00:30.560]  as a rule that we're going to pretend those two episodes don't exist okay because one obviously
[00:30.560 --> 00:34.800]  a lot of your listeners you know aren't subscribers i mean shame on them but you know
[00:34.800 --> 00:40.080]  we have to you know accept accept the unfortunate reality but two it's just going to be impossible
[00:40.080 --> 00:44.240]  to keep it straight otherwise so i think we we pretend like we've never talked about before and
[00:44.240 --> 00:49.920]  go from there well the good news is uh my podcast amnesia does not just apply to my own show it
[00:49.920 --> 00:54.640]  applies to dithering as well so i i actually don't don't really remember the specifics
[00:54.640 --> 00:59.840]  of what that was speaking of podcast amnesia i have a bit of follow-up but i actually don't
[00:59.840 --> 01:05.280]  remember which episode of my show i spoke about it i believe it was the recent one with molts
[01:06.640 --> 01:11.040]  but it could have been with nili i'm not quite sure but one of the recent episodes
[01:11.680 --> 01:17.840]  i we were talking about turning tvs on and off and i have this lgo led we bought it feels like
[01:17.840 --> 01:23.840]  we've had it forever but in fact it was installed like a week before covid hit which is why it feels
[01:23.840 --> 01:31.920]  like we've had it forever yeah that was a another era i i was telling somebody today somebody was
[01:31.920 --> 01:39.840]  asking about my eyes and my most recent cataract surgery was in june of 2020 and in fact was
[01:39.840 --> 01:44.480]  supposed to happen in march of 2020 and couldn't because the place where they were going to do it
[01:44.480 --> 01:50.560]  shut down so i very very very vividly remember that it yeah i was supposed to have it that i
[01:50.560 --> 01:56.560]  had to wait which was annoying because i couldn't see very well and then my eye doctor contacted me
[01:56.560 --> 02:01.520]  as soon as they were doing procedures again like did not forget me and it was much appreciated but
[02:01.520 --> 02:06.720]  i was talking about it like it was like three or four years ago it was like a year and a couple
[02:06.720 --> 02:14.160]  months it is amazing how this time has gone anyway i was complaining about the fact that with hdmi
[02:14.160 --> 02:19.440]  power and you know there's a couple of stupid names for it but the basic idea is that you
[02:19.440 --> 02:24.720]  connect your tv to like an apple tv or some other box and the box should be able to turn the tv on
[02:24.720 --> 02:32.240]  and off with just the one remote and with my lg we have a tivo hooked up and we have an apple tv
[02:32.240 --> 02:39.840]  hooked up and the tivo can turn the tv on and off but the apple tv can only turn it off which if it
[02:39.840 --> 02:44.880]  could only do one is better because it's like i just want to go to bed hit one button everything
[02:44.880 --> 02:50.240]  goes off i go to bed but if i want to just turn it on the apple tv power wouldn't turn it on
[02:51.280 --> 02:58.080]  and i just figured it was because i had the wrong type of hdmi cable like almost good enough but not
[02:58.080 --> 03:02.880]  quite good enough and it's goes through the back of the wall it would be like a nightmare to put a
[03:02.880 --> 03:07.200]  new cable back there i mean i can in theory i could switch the cable with the tivo but then
[03:07.200 --> 03:13.040]  maybe the tivo wouldn't work as well and i could just live with it whatever turns out from a
[03:13.040 --> 03:20.080]  listener of the show i thanked him personally but he he goes by a seemingly anonymous name on
[03:20.080 --> 03:25.120]  twitter so i don't want to mention it he thinks he has either the same tv as me or a similar one
[03:25.120 --> 03:32.640]  and if you go into settings this is on the on the lg tv you go to settings and then within settings
[03:32.640 --> 03:40.080]  and then within settings you go to all settings then you go to connection then you go to hdmi
[03:40.080 --> 03:46.240]  device settings not device connector don't go there because that'll mess it up and you turn on
[03:46.240 --> 03:56.720]  simp link hdmi cec and auto power sync and it it might all work and not only does this now all work
[03:56.720 --> 04:03.200]  but now the apple tv remote if the tv is off and it's set to the tivo it will not only turn the
[04:03.200 --> 04:11.280]  tv on but it will change the hdmi input to the apple tv gripping gripping radio um but for the
[04:11.280 --> 04:19.920]  record i had to mention this because this has been bedeviling me i have a magical system that
[04:19.920 --> 04:23.840]  everything just works and whatever you turn on and it switches the right input etc etc
[04:23.840 --> 04:30.240]  and then one day i updated my tv software i have no idea why i did that and then it stopped working
[04:30.240 --> 04:35.600]  and i'm just like i'm just killing myself i'm so mad i'm so frustrated i have to use two remotes
[04:35.600 --> 04:40.800]  all the time i'm not sure what happened it just started working again um so i backed my magical
[04:40.800 --> 04:44.800]  tv setup and i will never update another thing in my entertainment center again did you did you
[04:44.800 --> 04:51.120]  turn your tv off the internet to me that's key and number one it's sort of like a spyware type thing
[04:51.120 --> 04:56.480]  but number two i've got this tv setup perfect it is nothing and but there's nothing i want to do
[04:56.480 --> 05:01.840]  on the actual tv i don't want to use their smart apps so i've i've banned the tv from the internet
[05:03.280 --> 05:09.920]  yeah i i have it on the internet uh because i like the uh it has a chromecast built in
[05:09.920 --> 05:13.840]  and i know chromecast can be a little fidgety i also have a chromecast connected
[05:13.840 --> 05:19.840]  and i like having a backup because that's the way i watch mba games so i use chromecast all
[05:19.840 --> 05:24.560]  the time and it's really frustrating when it doesn't work so i like having it as a backup and
[05:24.560 --> 05:28.800]  whatever they could they can observe that i'm watching mba games then i'll bet though that's
[05:28.800 --> 05:33.280]  what happened to you i'll bet you got a software update that put the kai but but i but i approved
[05:33.280 --> 05:37.440]  the software update that's why i was mad at myself because it was it was it was my at least they asked
[05:37.440 --> 05:42.000]  you if you want to update but it wasn't it wasn't and then you didn't approve a next update and
[05:42.000 --> 05:46.320]  that's when it fixed itself it just fixed itself without even approving a software there might have
[05:46.320 --> 05:49.920]  there might have there might have been another update i'm not sure i i can't remember i just
[05:49.920 --> 05:56.400]  how devastated i was when it would do it it's not working uh with just just one remote like the
[05:56.960 --> 06:03.040]  it's it's so annoying because when it works it's like magic right you can turn on the playstation
[06:03.040 --> 06:08.800]  or or turn on the app tv or do you start streaming over chromecast or apple tv whatever it might be
[06:08.800 --> 06:13.200]  and it just goes to the right thing and it all works and this and the speakers turn on and
[06:13.200 --> 06:19.120]  it's amazing uh but which is how we grew up with old analog stuff like when everything was
[06:19.120 --> 06:25.120]  completely analog it was always one button no no no no would i remember what i you know
[06:25.120 --> 06:30.240]  do you remember the old nintendo like rf adapter oh yeah where you connected your tv and you had
[06:30.240 --> 06:38.160]  to like literally turn dials on your tv yeah and that not to not to date ourselves but well i i'll
[06:38.160 --> 06:44.800]  i'll go back to the atari 2600 where it it hooked up by screws to the antenna input uh on the back
[06:44.800 --> 06:51.520]  of the tv that's right you that's right yep and and it was a little box that you would uh the
[06:51.520 --> 06:57.760]  atari little dingus in the back of the tv had a a switch that was from two to three so you could
[06:57.760 --> 07:04.560]  pick whether you set your tv but you had to have the little box on two and the tv on two or the
[07:04.560 --> 07:08.880]  box on three and the tv on three right because because they didn't want to confuse in case your
[07:08.880 --> 07:14.080]  local station was on either two or three yeah but we had stations on both two and three so it never
[07:14.080 --> 07:19.920]  it was never very clear to me why they what this option was for and oh interesting so we only had
[07:19.920 --> 07:25.600]  a channel three say the next channel up was like channel 15 or something so we uh i thought that's
[07:25.600 --> 07:30.480]  why that existed but maybe obviously i'm over generalizing from well let me get let me get
[07:30.480 --> 07:36.240]  great let me get greedy here now that i've had a listener of the show fix my apple tv turning on
[07:36.240 --> 07:43.360]  the tv problem and if anybody remembers or knows why the atari 2600 offered you both two and three
[07:43.360 --> 07:50.160]  as options send me a email or a direct message or something like that and and let me know i'll
[07:50.160 --> 07:58.240]  update it on a future episode of gripping av club introductions to the talk show my guess my my best
[07:58.240 --> 08:03.200]  guess as a little kid was always that maybe if you lived really close to one of the stations
[08:03.200 --> 08:08.880]  the signal was so strong that it would screw up the atari yeah that could be the case but yeah
[08:08.880 --> 08:12.560]  that was we're clearly talking completely hard about your heads at this point i guess you're
[08:12.560 --> 08:18.320]  right see i guess things started going awry when we started hooking up tvs to actual stereos when
[08:18.320 --> 08:23.440]  i was a kid nobody even like the friend who had like the biggest tv that i was the most jealous
[08:23.440 --> 08:28.800]  of because it seemed the nicest it wasn't hooked up to a stereo the tv still played the audio
[08:28.800 --> 08:33.200]  through the tv speakers and it's you know once we started hooking stuff up to the receivers then you
[08:33.200 --> 08:39.600]  had to separate remote for this separate remote for that i also remember then getting a separate
[08:39.600 --> 08:44.640]  remote for the cable box that you had to use but i guess we use that for everything at that point
[08:44.640 --> 08:52.160]  i'm not sure but anyway i'm back to the simplicity of 1978 where i hit one button and it turns my
[08:52.160 --> 08:57.280]  apple tv on i almost want to rush through the show just so that i can go upstairs and turn my tv on
[08:59.520 --> 09:04.320]  let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor it's a new sponsor i'm very excited
[09:04.320 --> 09:13.760]  about them they're called rose r-o-w-s that's rose.com r-o-w-s.com they are a new spreadsheet
[09:13.760 --> 09:18.160]  on the web and they are coming out with a bunch of awesome features and some great
[09:18.160 --> 09:22.800]  great design just go to rose.com and take a look and you can kind of see the vibe of it it is very
[09:22.800 --> 09:27.680]  friendly the whole world runs on spreadsheets people love spreadsheets because they make you
[09:27.680 --> 09:33.520]  the owner of your data and you're thinking i use i personally use spreadsheets all the time i use
[09:33.520 --> 09:40.560]  them to manage everything from doing fireball sponsorships to tracking my nfl bets every
[09:40.560 --> 09:47.040]  weekend one of those makes me money one of those loses me money but i use spreadsheets for all of
[09:47.040 --> 09:51.520]  this but the problem with existing spreadsheets is they were invented for a world before the
[09:51.520 --> 09:57.760]  iphone and before cloud apis they're too ugly to share interesting data and they're also error
[09:57.760 --> 10:02.640]  prone it's easy to accidentally delete stuff and they are isolated from other tools rose
[10:02.640 --> 10:08.400]  reinvented the spreadsheet to let you build data-rich spreadsheets that look modern and slick
[10:09.360 --> 10:16.080]  they use the same logic as like google sheets or excel they have cells and functions same functions
[10:16.080 --> 10:22.000]  you're used to like sum vlookup index everything you're used to but on top of that they have added
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.040]  powerful integrations with business tools and public databases your spreadsheet can talk to
[10:27.040 --> 10:33.520]  google analytics twitter stripe salesforce slack it can send emails right from the spreadsheet
[10:34.160 --> 10:41.600]  it can even send things like slack alerts it's really really modern really of the current web
[10:41.600 --> 10:47.840]  and they offer a feature they call live sharing where somebody can be the editor of a spreadsheet
[10:47.840 --> 10:54.240]  and they can share it with teammates and limit the number of cells that the other person can
[10:54.240 --> 10:59.120]  make editable so nobody else can mess up parts of the spreadsheet that they aren't supposed to mess
[10:59.120 --> 11:05.200]  up you can turn spreadsheets into interactive dashboards reports and forms with buttons input
[11:05.200 --> 11:10.400]  fields check boxes almost turn it into like a little hypercard type thing it looks great you
[11:10.400 --> 11:18.240]  should give it a try what you can do is go to rose.com rows.com that's it no special url
[11:18.240 --> 11:25.200]  get started today my thanks to rose for sponsoring the show it's a good name for a spreadsheet in my
[11:25.200 --> 11:30.880]  opinion before we get to the metaverse there's a bit of breaking news there was a updated trial
[11:31.440 --> 11:36.560]  with epic and apple i actually watched a little bit of it for the first time so i had not seen
[11:36.560 --> 11:46.080]  judge ivan gonzales roger before she takes no bullshit man she cut apple's lawyer down to size
[11:46.080 --> 11:52.160]  quickly apple's been asking for a delay of her order that they changed the rules for the app
[11:52.160 --> 12:00.560]  store until this all the appeals are over and she seemed not just inclined to say no but in
[12:01.120 --> 12:05.920]  inclined to be annoyed that they were asking for that well so we have even further breaking news
[12:05.920 --> 12:11.280]  because the decision has actually been released oh and what does it say it is denied it literally
[12:11.280 --> 12:17.600]  just happened like 10 minutes ago uh it is it is denied and yeah she she gets basically like
[12:18.560 --> 12:23.760]  apples didn't make any new arguments all these arguments were at trial at the only reasons apple
[12:23.760 --> 12:28.400]  states are just to benefit apple and she's like i don't think it's very complicated to let
[12:28.400 --> 12:34.640]  developers have links in their apps it's pretty interesting fair point weeks are a well-known
[12:34.640 --> 12:41.040]  well-known technology here something along those lines she clearly throughout the whole trial has
[12:41.040 --> 12:46.800]  shown that she gets it at a high level at least and it's hard to argue with any of it she totally
[12:46.800 --> 12:50.640]  gets it i'm not surprised that her argument was something as simple as links are a well-known
[12:50.640 --> 12:56.240]  technology uh so it's did they get any kind of delay at all or is it still december 9th
[12:56.960 --> 13:02.880]  it's it's denied december 9th she's like apple didn't they didn't ask for a delay they so i'm
[13:02.880 --> 13:07.280]  not granting one because no because what applies for was a state uh which is you know so that
[13:07.280 --> 13:12.560]  basically the order is not enforced until all appeals are are exhausted um and that was denied
[13:12.560 --> 13:18.160]  and the other and the thing about this is this applies to all apps it's not you know we've
[13:18.160 --> 13:24.000]  talked a lot about apple should allow these links on non-gaming apps but this is going to apply to
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.240]  gaming apps as well where where you can have a link going outside so this is like this is a
[13:28.240 --> 13:35.200]  pretty big deal i think it actually really supports and backs up our breakdown of it in
[13:35.200 --> 13:40.480]  that it is clearly about links to another app it's not about building a pseudo in-app purchase
[13:40.480 --> 13:45.840]  experience that's that's apple's purview and i think she she sort of confirms that but apple
[13:45.840 --> 13:50.400]  should have loosened these rules years ago that like and then they wouldn't be in this position
[13:50.400 --> 13:57.200]  where it's coming down to a single judge and now they're it's going to cost them significantly more
[13:57.200 --> 14:03.200]  than just giving up on non-gaming apps would have would have cost them previously i think that's
[14:03.200 --> 14:09.040]  what they care about the most but it also makes them look like their hand was forced because
[14:09.040 --> 14:14.320]  their hand was forced right you know what i mean it's like somebody asks you to come into the
[14:14.320 --> 14:19.200]  courtroom and you maybe you should come into the courtroom but it's like if you come in
[14:19.200 --> 14:25.360]  you know with handcuffs and law enforcement leading you the way it doesn't look as voluntary
[14:25.360 --> 14:32.640]  as if you had just decided to show up december 9th is uh uh 30 days away huh well let's see what
[14:32.640 --> 14:36.640]  they come up with it seemed to me like they were not expecting it there was like a real change in
[14:36.640 --> 14:41.760]  demeanor with apple's lawyer mark perry whose name i'm familiar with from reading about but
[14:41.760 --> 14:46.720]  i hadn't seen him before but he seemed taken aback by her attitude that that was my re and that's all
[14:46.720 --> 14:53.360]  you know it was just a three panel zoom with her and epics lawyer and and him and he emphasized
[14:53.360 --> 14:58.240]  his argument emphasizing why apple was asking for this was that apple would like to have
[14:58.960 --> 15:06.160]  one set of rules worldwide and have despite the many complexities and differences in the law
[15:06.160 --> 15:12.560]  worldwide has largely achieved that which i think is actually honest i think that is true
[15:13.200 --> 15:19.840]  that for the most part the app store works the same around the world and the only differences
[15:19.840 --> 15:24.400]  are in like there are certain countries where certain types of apps are not allowed and they
[15:24.400 --> 15:29.440]  abide by those local laws but the actual app store policies themselves are pretty consistent
[15:30.000 --> 15:36.080]  and it it's clear that this might be the beginning of the end of that unless they wanted to apply
[15:36.880 --> 15:43.520]  her ruling worldwide the one thing to keep in mind is i believe i have again this just dropped so
[15:43.520 --> 15:50.240]  ivan read up on it but i believe that apple can appeal the denial of the stay and so it is possible
[15:50.240 --> 15:56.720]  that an appeals court will grant the stay which is an independent sort of thing that then actually
[15:56.720 --> 16:01.200]  winning winning on appeal or denying the appeal or whatever it might be so i think this is probably
[16:01.200 --> 16:07.680]  not over yet but again i that's that's me talking out of my room without having actually with this
[16:07.680 --> 16:14.400]  news that literally just dropped yeah it doesn't seem so unequivocal at apple win anymore at least
[16:14.400 --> 16:20.320]  from apple's perspective for sure i mean i feel like this part of the ruling is the shakiest part
[16:20.320 --> 16:24.240]  of the ruling you know particularly because it's based on this you know it's based on the
[16:24.240 --> 16:29.520]  california law not the u.s law the fact that it was applied nationally anyway i'm not sure if
[16:29.520 --> 16:34.480]  it's going to hold up which is a reason why one of the tests is the likelihood of success of the
[16:34.480 --> 16:39.600]  appeal or whatever might be of course the judge that issued the ruling thinks the likelihood of
[16:39.600 --> 16:44.480]  success is low because she wrote the opinion so that's why i'm thinking about the appeal there
[16:44.480 --> 16:50.080]  might be an appeals court that does give apple stay because there may be initially more skeptical
[16:50.080 --> 16:55.440]  of the ruling yeah what's the betting line it seems like a 50-50 call to me right it's
[16:57.120 --> 17:01.520]  i feel like the appeals courts if it's going to shake things up they're they're willing to grant
[17:01.520 --> 17:08.880]  the petitioner at least some time so i wouldn't be surprised if if this doesn't kick in december
[17:08.880 --> 17:13.920]  9th well it goes two ways because on one because the other hand it's just letting apps have links
[17:13.920 --> 17:17.920]  in their apps right and that was part of the judge's point it's like yeah maybe apple feels
[17:17.920 --> 17:22.080]  like it's shaking things up because because they don't like the policy but it's not like there's
[17:22.080 --> 17:27.440]  some deep technical change that is needed to be happened here it's just literally allowing apps
[17:27.440 --> 17:33.840]  to have links so it's it's pretty easy to roll back and it's like i could see from apple's
[17:33.840 --> 17:41.360]  perspective that even if that's it they want to get the language of the updated app store guidelines
[17:41.360 --> 17:46.080]  right i mean one way to look at what i was saying before about their their argument about
[17:46.080 --> 17:52.000]  one set of rules worldwide i don't think the guidelines go country by country i mean i guess
[17:52.000 --> 17:56.160]  presumably i don't even know i've actually never even thought about this before whether there are
[17:56.160 --> 18:02.480]  versions of the apple app store guidelines in other languages other than the ones i've always
[18:02.480 --> 18:09.200]  read in english i i could see that but it's like however much finesse they would like to put into
[18:09.200 --> 18:16.320]  the updated guidelines that they feel would comply with her injunction number one they should have
[18:16.320 --> 18:21.760]  been started on it already and number two even if they literally only get started on it now they
[18:21.760 --> 18:27.520]  should be able to have very good guidelines in a month i mean if it's just guidelines right let's
[18:27.520 --> 18:32.080]  know i think the reality is they had no intention of actually abiding by this i think that they were
[18:32.080 --> 18:38.640]  planning on putting in their own relaxed things that sort of they announced following the the
[18:38.640 --> 18:45.600]  japan antitrust commission ruling and they assumed that that would be sufficient but the again the
[18:45.600 --> 18:51.840]  reason why this is broader than the because the japan ruling is is similar in that apple steering
[18:51.840 --> 18:57.040]  provisions but it's only for reader apps and i think that's where apple wanted to take it and
[18:57.040 --> 19:00.960]  wanted to be like hey we allowed it for reader apps we're not going to allow for games and they
[19:00.960 --> 19:05.840]  would give you know various reasons justifications i think what they didn't anticipate weren't
[19:05.840 --> 19:11.280]  expecting was having to do it for everything but again that's apple's fault like they could have
[19:11.280 --> 19:18.640]  been writing new app store regulations for the last 10 years and the fact that they chose not to
[19:19.280 --> 19:26.000]  and insisted on garnishing every single cent that they could that's the core problem here and the
[19:26.000 --> 19:29.840]  core issue that they're running up against and it's exactly what we we've been talking about
[19:29.840 --> 19:35.840]  this for years app by being so intransigent it's going to cost them more like they're going to lose
[19:35.840 --> 19:40.480]  more than if they would have just given up a reasonable amount in the past yeah and it's funny
[19:40.480 --> 19:48.960]  too because even on like the shift towards moving more and more developers to just an 85 15 split
[19:48.960 --> 19:54.640]  from the start whether it's subscription or whatever it is and sort of just leaving the 70 30
[19:54.640 --> 20:03.760]  for the big revenue games google's solution is very simple google more or less moved all android
[20:03.760 --> 20:10.640]  developers in the play store to 85 15 that's so much simpler than apple's sort of shift towards 15
[20:10.640 --> 20:17.840]  which was to create the small business program i know which you have 1 million dollars in revenue
[20:17.840 --> 20:22.000]  and if you go over it there's a huge cliff yeah if you go over it you're actually losing money
[20:22.000 --> 20:26.160]  because then the next year you don't get into the small business you don't start over again
[20:26.160 --> 20:30.640]  it's like you're already out of the small business program because you made you know 1.1 million
[20:30.640 --> 20:36.560]  dollars the year before in revenue you have to apply for it and i've spoken to developers who
[20:36.560 --> 20:41.840]  who have applied for it it's not like three check boxes and sign your name and you're done it's you
[20:41.840 --> 20:47.760]  know it's more complicated than that and the apple-like solution should be the simpler one
[20:47.760 --> 20:56.480]  but it's the opposite and there's also the public relations game of the these two duopolists dancing
[20:56.480 --> 21:03.120]  around each other it's like a prisoner's dilemma situation right where maybe they're best off
[21:03.120 --> 21:07.520]  you know obviously they don't want to collude because that would be you know illegal and that's
[21:07.520 --> 21:12.640]  sort of what got apple into trouble with the ebooks thing a while back maybe it's in their
[21:12.640 --> 21:18.160]  best interest to just both stick to 70 30 for as much as they could as long as they could and maybe
[21:18.160 --> 21:24.080]  that's sort of what actually happened over the last 10 years but eventually somebody's gonna break
[21:24.080 --> 21:27.920]  and i mean i i think developers would say though it's not a prisoner's dilemma it's more of a
[21:27.920 --> 21:36.080]  warden's dilemma right the warden's dilemma i like that yeah hard to see it where this is going but
[21:36.080 --> 21:41.920]  it it's still it's yet another instance where apple does not come off looking well in the in
[21:41.920 --> 21:46.160]  the publicity it's going to surround it yeah the small business program is a is a just a great
[21:46.160 --> 21:50.720]  example of dude there's no way to interpret that other than just looking like they're being money
[21:50.720 --> 21:56.880]  rubbing like we like we are no we're not gonna let you big guys get a get a sliver of this you
[21:56.880 --> 22:02.960]  know i mean it's just it it's it's it's not a great look nothing about it is a great look
[22:02.960 --> 22:08.800]  that's you know i think pretty much everyone can agree on that one yeah and what what was you know
[22:08.800 --> 22:14.960]  and there was some kind of argument that they did they wanted to prevent scams like if if i own a
[22:14.960 --> 22:21.440]  company and i've got three games and combined they make more than a million dollars but i could split
[22:21.440 --> 22:26.560]  them up into three developer accounts and all three stay under a million and then all of a
[22:26.560 --> 22:34.560]  sudden i'm getting this it's like if all of the games are at that level is it really what what
[22:34.560 --> 22:39.920]  does it matter to apple right the the developers who matter like the fortnights of the world
[22:39.920 --> 22:46.320]  uh we're talking we're talking tens to hundreds of millions of dollars if not more
[22:47.680 --> 22:53.040]  well this is like the this is the most sort of disturbing thing about all this app store stuff
[22:53.680 --> 22:59.760]  is you know you see apple talking about it and on the stand like you know oh we created this
[22:59.760 --> 23:05.680]  you know this sense of sort of entitlement and you want to sit back and say oh that's they're
[23:05.680 --> 23:11.440]  just doing that for legal reasons but then you look at their actual actions and they all suggest
[23:11.440 --> 23:18.320]  a company that feels completely entitled to all this and feels that developers owe them and they're
[23:18.320 --> 23:24.240]  doing developers a favor and completely ignores the fact that developers are just as as a
[23:24.240 --> 23:30.560]  collective are very much responsible for the iphone success and and you know that that sort
[23:30.560 --> 23:39.440]  of entitlement and complete it like just refusing to even acknowledge fault or that someone else
[23:39.440 --> 23:44.400]  might have a point i think that speaks to the cognitive dissonance that that is inherent in
[23:44.400 --> 23:50.880]  this app store model like apple like it's very hard to sit around and think that you know like
[23:50.880 --> 23:56.880]  we sit on the outside like apple why are you doing this this is this is your sort of antithetical to
[23:56.880 --> 24:02.720]  what we thought you stood for and anyone internal to apple can feel that same way too but the way
[24:02.720 --> 24:08.160]  people deal with that conflict is they convince themselves that the opposite is true because it
[24:08.160 --> 24:11.920]  like it no one likes feeling that kind of dissonance they don't like feeling conflicted
[24:11.920 --> 24:16.160]  about why are we doing the right thing and so they actually end up becoming extremists in the
[24:16.160 --> 24:21.760]  opposite direction and it like everything that apple does around the app store it feels like
[24:21.760 --> 24:26.800]  that is what happened like they can they've convinced themselves that whatever they do is
[24:26.800 --> 24:34.000]  right and righteous and they're just going to double down and and it's it's you know it's on
[24:34.000 --> 24:39.680]  the verge of costing them significantly i forget what the story was but a week ago i wrote something
[24:39.680 --> 24:46.640]  it was something about the uh app store advertising and i i just wrote that apple should just get rid
[24:46.640 --> 24:51.520]  of it they they don't need it it it's a bad look it puts them in a conflict of interest with their
[24:51.520 --> 24:57.280]  developers and a friend of mine who uh until recently worked at apple for a long time um
[24:58.240 --> 25:06.320]  it just texted me and in agreement and said apple does one thing great they make creative tools
[25:06.320 --> 25:15.520]  for people and sell them at a fair price that people will pay for and everything else they do
[25:15.520 --> 25:22.960]  is root it ruins the the good part of apple everything else it's corrupting yep
[25:24.000 --> 25:29.680]  and i've said that too i've said this too before it is it's baffling to me because to me they are
[25:29.680 --> 25:37.200]  the only company i can ever remember ever that has gotten into both legal trouble and public
[25:37.200 --> 25:45.520]  relations trouble over antitrust and if you want to just take the legal aspect of it just call it
[25:45.520 --> 25:50.160]  bullying whatever you want to call it you know but they like from a public relations standpoint
[25:50.160 --> 25:55.680]  it's bullying or greed right it you don't have to put a legal definition on it but it's not a
[25:55.680 --> 26:02.960]  good look it is absolutely apple's public image in that regard has taken a serious hit in the last
[26:02.960 --> 26:11.040]  year because i remember last summer when there was the congressional hearing with the ceos and
[26:11.040 --> 26:19.280]  it was tim cook and bezos and sundar pachai and i guess zuckerberg right that was the four and
[26:20.240 --> 26:25.280]  there was sort of a uh there was there was a story before it came out that tim cook was
[26:25.280 --> 26:31.200]  apparently somewhat resistant apple was resistant to having tim cook testify voluntarily and you
[26:31.200 --> 26:40.400]  know sort of and he sort of had a why am i here attitude the whole time and in that congressional
[26:40.400 --> 26:46.960]  hearing did actually did not get a lot of hard questions and there was even when it was wrapped
[26:46.960 --> 26:52.720]  up a sort of as an observer you could say why was tim cook there seems like these other companies
[26:52.720 --> 26:59.520]  are the ones that that the house uh has a beef with yeah no that was my takeaway i wrote like
[26:59.520 --> 27:03.360]  apple seems like they're they're in good shape because no one's paying attention to them yeah
[27:03.360 --> 27:10.560]  that was one summer it was july of 2020 it it's unfathomable that there would be a hearing like
[27:10.560 --> 27:19.360]  that over these issues today where apple would not be the tim cook specifically you know they're
[27:19.360 --> 27:28.400]  testifying like uh and we sort of saw that right before the epic trial where uh uh apple was trying
[27:28.400 --> 27:34.800]  to get out of like a senate hearing and they sort of i guess were alluding to the upcoming epic
[27:34.800 --> 27:39.520]  trial and saying that we actually don't have time for this and they sent i forget the guy's name
[27:39.520 --> 27:46.000]  they sent but it was somebody you know lower level and he did terribly but he but he got
[27:46.000 --> 27:54.240]  really hard questions and it just gave uh answers that just did not play well and it's like they had
[27:54.240 --> 27:59.920]  their chance and like the clock was running out last year to sort of make some moves on their own
[28:00.800 --> 28:08.720]  while they still were in the good graces of public opinion um and and just seemingly missed it
[28:08.720 --> 28:16.400]  i i it's it's very strange well again though it is it is strange sort of from a objective sort
[28:16.400 --> 28:24.000]  of point of view but you go back to last i mean 2020 that was the year where we got i think both
[28:24.000 --> 28:30.240]  of us got inundated with reports about apple just really scrounging for pennies from the app store
[28:30.240 --> 28:35.440]  and like going after developers had been in the store for years because they had signups on their
[28:35.440 --> 28:39.360]  web for example and they didn't have an app purchase you know like i heard this story of
[28:39.360 --> 28:43.680]  like it was like this this company that builds an app for like stables or something like that
[28:43.680 --> 28:49.440]  let's just like it was a someone did it as like a passion project they hired a developer who worked
[28:49.440 --> 28:54.080]  basically at half price because you know they you know they liked the person and you know it was
[28:54.080 --> 28:58.560]  just her passion to like have this sort of app to manage like honestly like horse table or something
[28:58.560 --> 29:04.000]  like that and she basically had to like apple shows up and is like putting that purchase in
[29:04.000 --> 29:09.440]  the app or you're out of the store and and it was like it was a wet like it was it was a web
[29:09.440 --> 29:13.520]  app that basically just had a you know an app front end which is what apple i thought wanted
[29:13.520 --> 29:18.080]  people to you know oh an app is a better experience than going to the web etc etc
[29:18.080 --> 29:23.200]  and that was a one of a whole host of stories that we heard about last year and something like
[29:23.200 --> 29:27.120]  where there's this big crackdown then the hay thing happened and you know which was part of
[29:27.120 --> 29:34.640]  the same sort of move going on and the reality is that you're right 2020 was the time to shift
[29:34.640 --> 29:42.640]  but 2020 is when their sort of attitude and arrogance and you know we must have every penny
[29:42.640 --> 29:48.160]  attitude on the app store reached its peak and and that was the worst time for it to reach its peak
[29:48.160 --> 29:54.480]  for sure there were also those stories too the uh a covid specific where there would be like let's
[29:54.480 --> 30:00.960]  say a personal trainer whose livelihood pre-covid was entirely in-person personal training you know
[30:00.960 --> 30:07.840]  exercise and uh maybe teach and spin classes or whatever covid hits everything's closed down they
[30:07.840 --> 30:14.880]  want to stay in business and they'd start offering stuff remote where you could set your ipad or your
[30:14.880 --> 30:21.600]  apple tv or whatever and get a personal training session with your trainer and over the internet
[30:21.600 --> 30:26.640]  but now all of a sudden apple considered that digital content i think technically by the books
[30:26.640 --> 30:33.840]  they were right that by apple's sort of strained by apple's books to be clear well but it's it
[30:33.840 --> 30:40.160]  their their rules over what what counts for something they're entitled to their cut of and
[30:40.160 --> 30:46.080]  what isn't are actually clearer than a lot of people have given them credit for when you really
[30:46.080 --> 30:49.920]  really study them like people often bring up uber they're like well why the hell have i been buying
[30:49.920 --> 30:55.200]  all this stuff by uber on a credit card all this time and that's because it's not digital content
[30:55.200 --> 31:03.520]  that you enjoy on your on your apple device um there was a thing i forget the specifics of it
[31:03.520 --> 31:10.640]  but there was a thing where you could go to like the tesla app and buy one of those upgrades that
[31:10.640 --> 31:15.040]  gives you better autopilot because tesla ups even though your car has the feature you have
[31:15.040 --> 31:20.400]  to pay them for it and you could do it through their app and it wasn't an apple in-app purchase
[31:20.400 --> 31:25.520]  it was like direct payment to tesla even though it was digital content you're just unlocking a
[31:25.520 --> 31:29.440]  software feature in the car that you already own and people are like well you know that just shows
[31:29.440 --> 31:34.640]  you that if it's a big enough company like tesla apple just looks the other way but the exception
[31:34.640 --> 31:39.040]  from apple's perspective is you weren't buying digital content for your apple device you were
[31:39.040 --> 31:44.160]  buying it for your car which is none of their business they're they've been fairly consistent
[31:44.160 --> 31:51.200]  about it and so by that standard the sort of covid era okay i'm gonna buy personal services
[31:51.200 --> 31:57.360]  from a you know like my trainer or whoever it was or or or my uh therapist or whoever it might be
[31:57.360 --> 32:03.600]  uh it seemingly would qualify but it's such a bad look and it makes no sense like you don't
[32:03.600 --> 32:10.480]  what how much money are the are these personal trainers you know making by selling it workouts
[32:10.480 --> 32:15.920]  and stuff like that it was madness that they were going after these these these services
[32:17.360 --> 32:22.240]  yeah i mean that's what happens when you when you feel entitled and you've you've conditioned
[32:22.240 --> 32:30.480]  yourself to believe that you you deserve it all i mean like i mean i i i feel like there's really
[32:30.480 --> 32:35.920]  honestly it's hard to come up with deeper analysis than that because the personal trader thing is a
[32:35.920 --> 32:43.680]  great example it's so obviously a stupid thing to do and not just because it's a small amount of
[32:43.680 --> 32:50.240]  money but because it's a public relations disaster waiting to happen and you have to like your blind
[32:50.240 --> 32:55.600]  spot has to be the size of a semi-truck to allow that to happen and you think through like how do
[32:55.600 --> 33:00.960]  you end up with a blind spot the size of a semi-truck i mean because you you've conditioned
[33:00.960 --> 33:07.280]  yourself to just accept and assume that everything you do about the app store is ipso facto correct
[33:07.280 --> 33:12.560]  and right and righteous i remember like 20 some years ago in the midst of the microsoft uh
[33:12.560 --> 33:18.640]  antitrust trial tim o'reilly wrote a column on the o'reilly site at where he explained he tried
[33:18.640 --> 33:22.640]  to explain his mother asked him his mother you know said what is what's this microsoft thing
[33:22.640 --> 33:27.520]  in the government can you explain this to me and he tried his best to explain microsoft's business
[33:27.520 --> 33:32.640]  model and practices to his mother and his mother looked at him and said i get it this bill gates
[33:32.640 --> 33:37.520]  fellow he sounds like the sort of fellow who would show up to thanksgiving and he'd say grace and
[33:37.520 --> 33:43.840]  everybody gets ready to start eating and he says i'll have all the mashed potatoes yep and i just
[33:43.840 --> 33:48.640]  hear everything like huh that's not that bad that's actually pretty good uh all right let
[33:48.640 --> 33:52.880]  me take a break here before we get on to the metaverse and thank our next sponsor it's oh i

[35:02.240 --> 35:10.000]  delivish delicious food great recipes that you can follow step by step and it's over 30 percent
[35:10.000 --> 35:15.360]  cheaper than uh shopping at grocery stores with pre-portioned ingredients that ensure you won't
[35:15.360 --> 35:24.080]  spend money on excess food that ends up going into the trash uh go to hello fresh dot com slash
[35:24.080 --> 35:32.880]  talk show 14 that's hello fresh slash talk show one four talk show 14 and use that same code talk
[35:32.880 --> 35:44.000]  show 14 for up to 14 free meals and three free gifts uh go to hello fresh dot com slash talk show
[35:44.000 --> 35:51.040]  14 promo code talk show 14 gets you up to 14 free meals and three free gifts that's pretty good
[35:51.040 --> 35:59.120]  pretty pretty good all right tell me about the metaverse is it bullshit
[36:01.040 --> 36:04.640]  you had me on dithering land i know we're not we're going to pretend like we didn't talk about it
[36:04.640 --> 36:11.840]  but i i not that you fooled me but i i with the facebook announcement i i was more on board than
[36:11.840 --> 36:19.680]  i thought i would be and i was more on board post facebook keynote than i am now a week later
[36:19.680 --> 36:26.960]  so i think the one thing i do reject and then different people will argue about this yes or no
[36:26.960 --> 36:34.560]  is i don't think the metaverse is going to be some sort of new distinct sort of thing uh you
[36:34.560 --> 36:40.000]  know i i think that it's the the metaverse is and will be the internet you know the the internet
[36:40.000 --> 36:45.600]  all the things are being connected and and they're being sort of persistent presence and and you know
[36:45.600 --> 36:49.680]  this stuff you can own stuff online like that's some of the things that crypto is actually
[36:49.680 --> 36:55.840]  addressing right now i i i think the so i think the metaverse is the internet i think the analogy
[36:55.840 --> 37:01.600]  that i come to is the mobile internet remember when the mobile internet was a thing it was the
[37:01.600 --> 37:05.920]  the internet that you experienced on mobile devices and we don't say the mobile anymore
[37:05.920 --> 37:12.960]  because it's all just the internet my definition of the metaverse is the metaverse is an internet
[37:12.960 --> 37:21.440]  that you primarily or often experience via virtual reality uh and that doesn't mean it's a distinct
[37:21.440 --> 37:25.840]  thing from the internet because you could also access it from your phone or from your computer
[37:25.840 --> 37:31.680]  or from augmented reality glasses or whatever sort of devices we may have in the long run and
[37:31.680 --> 37:36.640]  so that's the way i define it now that's not a universal definition but that's the way i think
[37:36.640 --> 37:42.800]  about it it's the internet where the best and often primary experience is through virtual
[37:42.800 --> 37:49.680]  reality but you can but it's still just the internet that's so you you have a strateckery
[37:49.680 --> 37:56.240]  weekly article that came out uh i guess today was it yesterday i forget yeah today your time yeah
[37:56.240 --> 38:04.240]  yeah you and i never know i agree on what day it is um uh i started reading it and i was excited
[38:04.240 --> 38:07.520]  because we had already been talking about you coming on this show to talk about the metaverse
[38:07.520 --> 38:11.200]  and you said well i'm going to write my weekly article about it anyway and i thought well this
[38:11.200 --> 38:15.920]  is going to be great this timing will be perfect you can write your article i can read it and then
[38:15.920 --> 38:20.320]  we can argue about it because i think we're going to disagree and i started reading your weekly
[38:20.320 --> 38:25.120]  article and you made that you're kind of open with that same point that isn't the internet
[38:25.920 --> 38:29.680]  the metaverse and i thought oh god damn it this is going to suck there's not going to be any
[38:29.680 --> 38:37.520]  argument here that's my point i i kind of was going that way and then thankfully later in your
[38:37.520 --> 38:45.440]  article you you go places where i do disagree um but i i i do kind of think that and i do think
[38:46.240 --> 38:52.800]  that zuckerberg's vision out laid in the renaming of the company to meta
[38:52.800 --> 38:58.320]  and this sort of uh how long was the keynote was it an hour maybe it was 90 minutes um
[39:01.280 --> 39:11.360]  outlying his vision he really i think went hard on the metaverse being a new thing and he maybe
[39:11.360 --> 39:17.200]  he didn't quite say that but it's sort of like what the internet was to what the world was before
[39:17.200 --> 39:25.200]  the internet the metaverse would be to the internet yeah basically and you can kind of
[39:25.200 --> 39:31.200]  see how mark zuckerberg might actually believe that because in some sense facebook has come as
[39:31.200 --> 39:38.320]  close as anybody to doing that themselves you know that that for some in some sense of the word
[39:38.880 --> 39:43.120]  facebook could be your whole internet in a way that no other company has ever done
[39:43.120 --> 39:47.600]  facebook could be your whole internet in a way that no other company has ever achieved
[39:49.840 --> 39:54.400]  right and they've had goals like that right they've and programs that have been controversial
[39:54.400 --> 40:01.040]  where they have proposed going into countries around the world low-income countries and
[40:01.040 --> 40:06.800]  building out internet infrastructure and giving it away for free but it wouldn't give you access
[40:06.800 --> 40:11.520]  to the actual internet it would just give you access to facebook and facebook services
[40:11.520 --> 40:17.440]  uh i believe in india it was a big country where they where they uh were proposed doing that and
[40:17.440 --> 40:23.520]  it i think thankfully i would say sort of largely fell on its face it didn't really take off but it
[40:23.520 --> 40:30.560]  was such a bizarre proposal in my opinion yeah because like the the free basics i think is what
[40:30.560 --> 40:35.440]  it's called where you could if you wanted though yeah you get facebook and some other sites they
[40:35.440 --> 40:39.920]  like oh you wikipedia uh but then uh if you wanted the full internet then you had to pay off
[40:39.920 --> 40:45.760]  pay you'll give us a higher price cell phone plan or whatever it might be wikipedia is a fantastic
[40:45.760 --> 40:51.360]  resource and has made the world a remarkably better place and has worked far better than i
[40:51.360 --> 40:57.440]  think most of us at least i ever thought that it would and seemingly is working for the long term
[40:57.440 --> 41:03.520]  but it is also the best friend of like a company like facebook building something like this out
[41:03.520 --> 41:07.520]  where they could say look we'll give you access to wikipedia the number one website in the entire
[41:07.520 --> 41:12.480]  world and it doesn't really affect all the world's knowledge yeah but it doesn't really affect them
[41:12.480 --> 41:18.320]  competitively in any way whatsoever it actually just absolves them of needing to offer the
[41:18.320 --> 41:26.560]  equivalent uh you know an encyclopedia i think for this point about them creating their own
[41:27.120 --> 41:31.920]  like their own metaverse it it i think you're putting your finger on one of the things that
[41:31.920 --> 41:36.720]  makes this confusing because there there is a there is a point to be made that if you want to
[41:36.720 --> 41:43.600]  that if you want the true a true sort of metaverse experience that and i could definitely see this
[41:43.600 --> 41:50.560]  being the case where to have a full sense of presence and everything is sort of a and i think
[41:50.560 --> 41:54.480]  this is what i try to get i i don't i wasn't super happy with the article you should be honest i
[41:54.480 --> 42:00.480]  think it was i was trying to sort of get to is you can have this sort of fully contained experience
[42:00.480 --> 42:07.280]  where everything is 3d and everything is sort of in this environment and it's super immersive but
[42:07.280 --> 42:13.520]  i don't think that will ever be the totality of the internet like like it's going to be like and
[42:13.520 --> 42:17.760]  so i actually wrote this i think back in august i think it's better to think of it there being
[42:17.760 --> 42:23.040]  metaverses where there's oh there can be lots of these different experiences there could be the
[42:23.040 --> 42:28.240]  facebook metaverse and there could be you know other companies metaverses and we can get to
[42:28.240 --> 42:34.480]  microsoft maybe in a little bit and within that particular experience it's super full featured
[42:34.480 --> 42:38.720]  and if it's really awesome you may want to spend a lot of your time there because it's so great
[42:39.280 --> 42:45.600]  but i don't think there will ever be one company that sort of owns it all as it were i mean maybe
[42:45.600 --> 42:51.440]  the the iphone is an interesting example where you could say that all the apps and if you just
[42:51.440 --> 42:57.760]  only use apps you're sort of living in the ios metaverse to borrow the term but safari is there
[42:57.760 --> 43:02.160]  as a window to the broader internet if that's if that's what you would what you want to do and
[43:02.160 --> 43:08.000]  maybe that's sort of a way to think about their vision and what they're going for that definitely
[43:08.000 --> 43:13.760]  captures the idea of being a platform where people spend most their time but not if i should use that
[43:13.760 --> 43:19.360]  as an example now sort of talking myself into that that analogy but i think that that's that's
[43:19.360 --> 43:25.600]  the way to think about so there's the metaverse broadly the universal idea is the internet but
[43:25.600 --> 43:30.960]  there's also sort of a superior experience which i think can only be delivered by a single company
[43:30.960 --> 43:38.560]  because you need some company to enforce like the rules like we just talked about the app store
[43:38.560 --> 43:44.880]  where you can have this experience that is sort of consistent and things are interoperable all
[43:44.880 --> 43:49.360]  those sorts of things but i think it's going to be a self-contained sort of thing yeah because
[43:49.360 --> 43:55.680]  otherwise you you devolve into as like i like to use the analogy calvin ball which was the sport
[43:55.680 --> 44:01.680]  that calvin from calvin and hobson used to play uh where the only rule is that you can change the
[44:01.680 --> 44:06.800]  rules at any time you know and so yep it was you know all of a sudden you go from scoring goals to
[44:06.800 --> 44:14.240]  scoring runs to uh playing tag and it's all just made up on the fly and nothing is really cohesive
[44:14.240 --> 44:21.280]  it doesn't get you to the world where you can actually take your avatar self from one product
[44:21.280 --> 44:26.640]  to another right somebody has to be somebody has to be the referees or the the league you know if
[44:26.640 --> 44:32.400]  you want to compare it to sports right only the league can sort of set the that's right the new
[44:32.400 --> 44:38.320]  rules for pass interference right because we we because of the way the internet came along
[44:38.320 --> 44:45.680]  like we got these sort of shared protocols and standards and i just think that it's it's naive
[44:45.680 --> 44:51.520]  to think that we're gonna get this sort of advanced protocols and standards that are
[44:51.520 --> 44:57.280]  going to be universally accepted ever again like why you like just because there's too much money
[44:57.280 --> 45:02.320]  to be made there's too much control to be sought and so if you're if you want to deliver an
[45:02.320 --> 45:07.920]  experience that exceeds the capabilities of the protocols that we have today it's going to have
[45:07.920 --> 45:15.200]  to be a bit of a walled garden experience just to make it work and and and so that i think that's
[45:15.200 --> 45:20.560]  you know and so that's why we always need two words for it right like you can have a metaverse
[45:20.560 --> 45:25.760]  type experience of the internet but yeah i just think there's going to be multiple metaverses that
[45:25.760 --> 45:31.680]  you can sort of pick and choose from it is interesting in hindsight if we want to don our
[45:31.680 --> 45:39.440]  old old man hats um but i do think and i try not to make proclamations too far in the future i i
[45:39.440 --> 45:44.240]  almost never make any predictions more than a few years in the future because i think it's too hard
[45:44.240 --> 45:51.040]  in tech and i don't want to be wrong um but i i i think it's safe to say that for the rest of my
[45:51.040 --> 45:58.560]  career decades to come hopefully um i don't think we'll see a moment where something like the
[45:58.560 --> 46:05.040]  internet could rise again um because i do think that part of the sweet spot was that it sort of
[46:05.040 --> 46:17.760]  hit at like peak world war ii us uh it is yeah but also also like a political sense of hey that
[46:17.760 --> 46:23.600]  every there is no political left-right divide over the argument that the u.s federal government
[46:23.600 --> 46:28.960]  should do big things you know and also it also there was like it was anti-communist and we want
[46:28.960 --> 46:33.760]  to be free right open right and also the fear of like nuclear bombs so it needs to be you know
[46:33.760 --> 46:38.160]  a network and failsafe and all those sorts of things i mean the eisenhower highway system is
[46:38.160 --> 46:44.000]  another example of it right i mean it's you know the the eisenhower is the president and it was
[46:44.000 --> 46:49.920]  very very hard to drive uh especially across state lines and each state had their own roads but none
[46:49.920 --> 46:54.960]  and it was just like well the federal government will just come in and make these big highways it
[46:54.960 --> 47:01.360]  on sensible routes and we'll just go right through states and i i don't know maybe at the time there
[47:01.360 --> 47:05.200]  i guess everything is controversial in some degree and some people argued about it but
[47:05.200 --> 47:10.800]  it doesn't seem historically that it was all that contentious there was a lot more going on in the
[47:10.800 --> 47:17.280]  50s that was contentious than that and you know like this 60s equivalent you know like that the
[47:17.280 --> 47:22.720]  the space race wasn't seen as like a democratic initiative it was like the us needs to put a man
[47:22.720 --> 47:27.360]  on the moon you know we've got to do it and everybody just got behind it and building out
[47:27.360 --> 47:33.040]  the internet seemed like a sensible thing too and we're just no longer there i mean we're talking
[47:33.040 --> 47:38.000]  about like fixing bridges and stuff and it took uh took eight months and a bunch of political
[47:38.000 --> 47:45.520]  pulled teeth yeah well again i think the the existence of the us are can't be overestimated
[47:45.520 --> 47:53.200]  in this regard right like like you go back to the moon landing i mean that was 100 explicitly
[47:53.200 --> 47:58.720]  framed as we're competing with the soviets right especially you know the moment was they they
[47:58.720 --> 48:05.280]  watched they watched a rocket to space before we before we did and you know and so that that once
[48:05.280 --> 48:10.960]  the soviet union went away you know i mean americans are a militant culture we love to fight
[48:10.960 --> 48:16.560]  so we decided to fight each other right and those sort of things take decades to to work their way
[48:16.560 --> 48:21.440]  out of so yeah it's not just that though but like if you think about the effects of i mean there's
[48:21.440 --> 48:25.920]  two big things about the internet number one no one at the time ever anticipated you would make
[48:25.920 --> 48:30.400]  money in the internet like it was it was like a research project or like a you know fall back for
[48:30.400 --> 48:36.080]  nuclear war whatever might be and number two definitely no one saw that the internet would
[48:36.080 --> 48:41.600]  have these sort of massive destabilizing effects on the media ecosystem and by extension the
[48:41.600 --> 48:48.400]  political ecosystem and all these sorts of things and so if it were to come along today
[48:48.400 --> 48:53.600]  again companies would be whatever would comes along in the future one you'd have companies
[48:53.600 --> 48:57.840]  that were immediately saying how can we make a profit off of this and two governments would be
[48:57.840 --> 49:02.320]  immediately trying to control it and make sure that it doesn't sort of disrupt things too much
[49:02.320 --> 49:08.000]  and it was really sort of a perfect circumstances i think you're exactly right about general sort of
[49:08.000 --> 49:15.360]  national unification and and anti-communist and also no one really thinking about the profit
[49:15.360 --> 49:20.560]  potential or the destabilization potential like like that's not going to happen again and that
[49:20.560 --> 49:26.400]  was the environment that was necessary for this to sort of come along and it was in that environment
[49:26.400 --> 49:32.880]  that literally the protocols and interoperability that we rely on today were by and large established
[49:32.880 --> 49:40.240]  in the 60s and 70s and it just none of those conditions are ever going to exist again but the
[49:40.240 --> 49:45.520]  funny thing too is looking back at like the 80s and 90s so like the like the groundwork of the
[49:45.520 --> 49:51.920]  internet was laid in the 60s and 70s and it continued to steadily thump towards becoming
[49:51.920 --> 50:01.120]  what it exploded as you know like with Netscape in the mid 90s but in the meantime all of the
[50:01.120 --> 50:07.360]  computer companies were building out all of their networking stuff as proprietarily as possible
[50:07.360 --> 50:13.840]  right nothing nothing worked with each other apple had apple talk and there was even ethernet
[50:13.840 --> 50:19.600]  was proprietary and there was a token ring and what was that company that you used to have to
[50:19.600 --> 50:25.600]  be certified as on the pc side it was uh like a company out of utah do you remember well yeah
[50:25.600 --> 50:32.800]  novel yeah and that was like a big deal like in my time in college in the early 90s it was
[50:32.800 --> 50:39.200]  certainly nothing i wanted to be involved with but it was absolutely like when you and again
[50:39.200 --> 50:43.680]  this is how you'd find a job back then because there was no well there was an internet but
[50:43.680 --> 50:48.160]  everybody wasn't on the internet and so if you wanted to find a job you'd go buy the sunday
[50:48.160 --> 50:53.760]  newspaper and there was this phone book sized classified section and you'd go to the computer
[50:53.760 --> 50:59.200]  jobs and it was all novel certified engineer three years experience novel certified engineer
[50:59.200 --> 51:04.720]  two two years experience all of it was completely proprietary and we're talking like two or three
[51:04.720 --> 51:11.680]  years before everything went to ip it's kind of bananas that nobody that the industry didn't see
[51:11.680 --> 51:20.480]  it coming because they sort of even with that imminent wave coming the mindset of the for
[51:20.480 --> 51:28.640]  profit companies to build proprietary for profit even networking things was i don't even think i
[51:28.640 --> 51:33.840]  don't even think that they second guess themselves and i think that they saw the internet as just an
[51:34.560 --> 51:40.480]  right up until the very end as this obscure thing that's just for universities and you know computer
[51:40.480 --> 51:46.960]  computer science students at at stanford and mit yeah i think this point is is is pretty underrated
[51:46.960 --> 51:52.880]  too because you it matters when it comes to the devices themselves like pcs were were not about
[51:52.880 --> 51:57.760]  accessing the internet play like they you know famously windows 95 didn't even have a TCP IP
[51:57.760 --> 52:03.360]  stack you had to you had to install it you could do like buy TCP IP it was the same same on the on
[52:03.360 --> 52:09.440]  the mac side at the same time in the mid 90s yeah and so all these computers in the 80s are running
[52:09.440 --> 52:14.400]  dawson and early windows and all that sort of stuff they were all for doing things on that
[52:14.400 --> 52:20.880]  computer like like like having a spreadsheet on that computer and the big sort of and so all the
[52:20.880 --> 52:27.120]  networking around that time was about connecting pcs in the same place and a huge thing was just
[52:27.120 --> 52:32.640]  connecting to the printer right like because that was how you mostly consumed and got information
[52:32.640 --> 52:36.480]  off of the spreadsheet is you had to print it and you do want to have a printer cut to every
[52:36.480 --> 52:40.480]  computer so you want to have one printer for the whole for the whole floor and you needed to somehow
[52:41.520 --> 52:46.080]  tie all that together and like that was the that was the mindset and that was where in critically
[52:46.080 --> 52:51.120]  that was where the money was to be made because enterprises were the ones paying for computers
[52:51.120 --> 52:54.960]  they're paying for them because the spreadsheet made you know knowledge workers so much more
[52:54.960 --> 53:01.280]  productive a word processor was so superior to a typewriter that like it was worth paying for it
[53:01.280 --> 53:07.280]  but that meant that the companies that wanted to make a profit were flowing in this direction and
[53:07.280 --> 53:13.920]  yeah meanwhile the internet sort of evolving at the same time on the side but it's like what like
[53:13.920 --> 53:20.800]  how the universal thing that anyone can access like who can make money there and that allowed
[53:20.800 --> 53:25.360]  the internet to sort of like go in that direction and what's interesting is because then that the
[53:25.360 --> 53:32.640]  the TCP IP protocol sort of existed and that if you were a new company a new entrant coming in
[53:32.640 --> 53:38.880]  you could leverage the sort of open sort of protocol and get a head start and offer something
[53:38.880 --> 53:45.520]  that the legacy guys couldn't and wouldn't because they wanted to preserve their lock-in and you know
[53:45.520 --> 53:49.760]  and so and then it eventually became overwhelming and then the internet actually started to have
[53:49.760 --> 53:58.480]  huge useful applications but again today the internet does exist the like this idea of
[53:58.480 --> 54:04.240]  connected to anything everywhere already does exist it is an open protocol and again so that
[54:04.240 --> 54:10.000]  just be like how are you going to get something superior to that it's just it's again it's hard
[54:10.000 --> 54:14.560]  to imagine you can literally put your light bulbs on the internet i mean that's actually a thing
[54:14.560 --> 54:20.960]  that you can do i mean it may not be a great idea but you yes you can but it it just was
[54:22.880 --> 54:27.760]  there's all sorts of science fiction ideas and the metaverse stuff obviously i the whole name
[54:27.760 --> 54:35.200]  metaverse comes from science fiction and neil stevenson um and the whole idea of virtual reality
[54:35.200 --> 54:44.080]  is easily imagined by science fiction authors long long time ago because you know it's it's
[54:44.080 --> 54:51.760]  not that unlike dreaming or just you know it's it's a long time it's it's almost innate to human
[54:51.760 --> 54:58.240]  nature to to have a fantasy of being able to like close your eyes and go to another place um
[54:59.280 --> 55:04.960]  but the some of the details of the way the internet's played out you never would have
[55:04.960 --> 55:12.240]  imagined you being able to turn your lights out from a thousand miles away it's kind of
[55:12.240 --> 55:15.600]  you know it's just funny how it shakes out in the details and i feel like that's also
[55:16.560 --> 55:21.920]  what's coming with this vr ar stuff is it's going to play out in ways that we don't imagine
[55:21.920 --> 55:27.920]  it it's very very you know just a thousand little ways it'll be like oh never would have thought
[55:27.920 --> 55:33.840]  about that so one of the things that's interesting is the distinction between vr and ar and i've
[55:33.840 --> 55:37.280]  always assumed that ar is going to be bigger just for the same reason the phone was bigger right
[55:37.280 --> 55:43.280]  you can use it anywhere uh you know like there's more like filling in being around you and with you
[55:43.280 --> 55:48.880]  is a much larger and compelling market than something that you sort of go to as sort of a
[55:48.880 --> 55:54.560]  destination device and one of the reasons why i become more bullish on vr is in part this sort of
[55:54.560 --> 55:59.520]  working remotely like like yeah i think i've said oh again we're not we're pretending like we
[55:59.520 --> 56:04.240]  haven't said anything previously but i think work from home is a misnomer you you you don't work
[56:04.240 --> 56:09.200]  from home you work online you might happen to be at home but the fact you're at home has
[56:09.200 --> 56:14.800]  absolutely nothing to do with your job like it's completely immaterial sort of fact and in that
[56:14.800 --> 56:21.520]  case like going to work by means of putting on a headset that gives you a potentially superior
[56:21.520 --> 56:25.280]  computing experience again not today but where you have as many monitors as you want all the
[56:25.280 --> 56:29.440]  screen space you want you know you could go into a meeting you're just clicking a button and you
[56:29.440 --> 56:34.400]  have the presence with other people i think is is pretty compelling the reason i become more bullish
[56:34.400 --> 56:42.800]  on on vr but the reason i sort of bring this up in this in this sort of context is one of the common
[56:42.800 --> 56:49.200]  pushbacks is people are like oh you know people just sitting you know it's like the movie up right
[56:49.200 --> 56:53.200]  people just sitting around and getting fat and with their with their sort of headsets on all day
[56:53.200 --> 56:58.640]  etc etc and i i think one of the things you talked about about unintended consequences and the way
[56:58.640 --> 57:08.560]  this sort of plays out is there is an an aspect of technology where there is sort of the aspirational
[57:08.560 --> 57:12.320]  and what we want to tell ourselves about technology and then there's sort of like the
[57:12.320 --> 57:18.000]  reality of the what people actually do and what are actually looking for and i think an example
[57:18.000 --> 57:23.040]  is to go back to the app store right apple likes to talk about the app store as being this you know
[57:23.040 --> 57:27.440]  great opportunity for developers and people getting the apps they need and there's an app for
[57:27.440 --> 57:33.360]  there's an app for that etc etc when the sort of ugly reality is that the vast majority of money
[57:33.360 --> 57:40.560]  the app store is made from people who are playing these these pay-to-play games and you have a very
[57:40.560 --> 57:45.680]  small percentage of the population that is spending thousands of dollars on buying gems or
[57:45.680 --> 57:52.880]  whatever it might be and they play it for hours and that's kind of it's like the the the there's
[57:52.880 --> 57:58.080]  in a lot in a lot of areas there's a real conflict between the story we want to tell ourselves about
[57:58.080 --> 58:03.440]  it and the way it's actually experienced and i i think there's going to be some of this with
[58:03.440 --> 58:07.680]  how the metaverse plays out we like we want to say oh who wants to go sit in a you know with
[58:07.680 --> 58:12.000]  a headset on and escape from the real world well a lot of people sit around and watch tv for hours
[58:12.000 --> 58:20.160]  a day like i like the there's there's some aspect of companies that actually meet people where they
[58:20.160 --> 58:26.640]  are and give them what they actually want tend to win over companies that want to serve an idealized
[58:26.640 --> 58:31.040]  customer because it makes them sort of feel better all right there's a lot to unpack there
[58:31.040 --> 58:36.080]  but i have to start by telling you that the movie you're talking about is wall-e not up
[58:36.880 --> 58:41.600]  oh yeah sorry yeah the up is the old guy with the balloons uh my bad that's all right i was saying
[58:41.600 --> 58:45.360]  when i was thinking i was you know he was one of those things there was some little voice in the
[58:45.360 --> 58:49.360]  back of my head that was saying like something's wrong here uh but i just plowed forward they did
[58:49.360 --> 58:53.600]  they did have some technology though the bad guy who had those dogs had they had some crazy
[58:53.600 --> 58:57.840]  technology that would let the dogs you know talk or something like that but wall-e was the one
[58:57.840 --> 59:03.120]  where people sort of uh they trashed the planet and then go into outer space and just sort of
[59:03.120 --> 59:11.040]  sit around in a barcalounger with a vr headset all day um big and large or whatever yeah yeah
[59:11.040 --> 59:25.120]  but are by and large big and large by and large uh anyway um i i do think we were it does seem it
[59:25.120 --> 59:32.560]  it seems like an unusual moment in tech where there's nobody knows how it's going to play out
[59:32.560 --> 59:42.080]  but there is very as widespread as it ever gets because ar neither ar nor vr are a big deal yet
[59:42.640 --> 59:48.320]  right i mean there i i know that sounds ridiculous for our audience because i'm sure you know
[59:48.880 --> 59:53.120]  many of the people who listen to have vr headsets and stuff but it's it's not probably sick of us
[59:53.120 --> 59:57.440]  talking about it right but it's not mainstream technology you know it's like smartphones before
[59:57.440 --> 01:00:01.840]  the iphone you know sure there were smartphones before the iphone but in hindsight they were no
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:11.280]  big deal at all uh and if anything i would say both ar and vr are behind where like
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:20.400]  early 2000s smartphones were right because like blackberries really served their purpose well
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:25.920]  just for messaging like if you really say it's like pre-blackberry yeah it's almost like yeah
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:30.160]  that's exactly how i would put it like like i didn't have a blackberry and i didn't want one
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:36.240]  but i also instantly got why the people who were addicted to them were addicted to them
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:42.320]  like it's like i just did not live a messaging type world and wouldn't have had anybody to send
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:51.520]  them to but i could totally get why like attorneys you know texting each other all day
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:58.480]  was a huge deal totally got it i feel like that's we're still like pre-blackberry but it seems like
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:04.080]  everybody i don't think though that everybody agreed at that time that mobile was going to be
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:12.400]  that big a deal because we were too close that that same era like it's it's kind of one of the
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:18.160]  things that's funny in hindsight is how close the iphone was to when the internet became a big thing
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:25.120]  right like the time from netscape's ipo to the iphone is like 11 years something like that it's
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:32.400]  not long i think the browser was 92 or 93 so 14 years uh and yeah and we are 14 years on from the
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:39.040]  iphone right so it's and and the browser didn't really explode right away even in the way the
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:46.080]  iphone did right it's it wasn't a sensation um like i still remember and i know that they only
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:50.160]  had like 10 million sales in the first year or something like that some blip compared to the
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:58.080]  modern iphone sales but i remember picking up my iphone uh on day one and then like walking around
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:04.160]  philadelphia and for a while actually feeling conspicuous because so many people would say oh
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:08.960]  my god is that an iphone like go to the grocery store and i'd have like a think i was so smart
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:14.160]  because now i have a grocery list on my beautiful little iphone and people would just random
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:18.720]  strangers would come up to me and say hey is that an iphone and i started to feel like uh maybe i
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:22.640]  should keep it in my pocket because i don't want to i don't want to talk to these people uh like
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.520]  i don't think the web browser was like that in 1993 or you know whenever it was before it was
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:33.360]  called netscape when it was mosaic um well i think that's a really important point though which is
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.000]  this is one of the reasons why it's going to be challenging to bring to market because like
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.720]  something you go to home and it's nor you do at home and it's hard to sort of demonstrate
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:48.400]  right like the thing about the phone and why apple it was such a great market for apple is
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:55.280]  number one to your point like it was visible and like the whole apple status symbol being a nice
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:01.040]  device very much worked in their favor but two you were already going to buy a mobile phone no
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.520]  matter what and like a smart like for a few hundred dollars more you could get this incredible
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:09.520]  device that does so much more why wouldn't you buy it and then once you buy it you're you're
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:16.240]  hooked uh whereas you know like what why should i buy a pc why should i try a browser why should
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:21.600]  i try a vr headset they're much much more challenging problems i just don't think i
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:27.040]  basically i don't think in hindsight that circa like the rise circa the rise of blackberry
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:33.360]  there wasn't a consensus that the whole internet is moving towards this new device class it felt
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:38.720]  like we already had the device class it was pcs because right right it'll just be sort of a side
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:46.000]  uh an addition to pcs right it would be uh the great little addition um it just did it boggled
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.720]  the mind that that these little little things we keep in our pocket would actually be bigger than
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:59.760]  the pc as as the primary consumption devices for the for the entire internet um and i sort of feel
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:08.880]  like as opposed to that we've definitely got we've got a shared consensus that something we're moving
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:19.520]  towards something to make ar and vr that big of a deal and both of them there there's not many
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:25.680]  options for that at a certain level like optically you've you know we've only got two eyes and
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:34.080]  they're on our face and so we're talking about glasses or goggles and sure eventually again
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:42.240]  projecting way past our our decade uh event horizon you we can imagine some kind of implants
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:47.760]  or something but you know that's that's still science fiction stuff you know that that you'd
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:54.080]  actually have like something in your eye um but you need something right it there's not many ways
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:59.360]  there's not many ways to go see i don't know it's interesting i think i might be the opposite of you
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:07.440]  whereas i was pretty bullish on mobile and i think that maybe that was because i was in asia
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:14.880]  and the idea like just mobile was it felt like it was a more necessary thing than even even in the
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:20.160]  us and also i mean even as in the us i remember i was i was with those people that actually
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:27.280]  used like wap websites so that there was a site that it was a wap rss reader and and so i was
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:33.920]  you know glued to my phone at a very at a very early age and so i i was always pretty bullish
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:39.520]  on mobile and in contrast i've been pretty skeptical that there's anything past mobile
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:47.680]  that's going to be as meaningful and excuse me so this is this is this is a bit of a shift i still
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:52.400]  think mobile is going to continue to be the most important for years and years and years to come
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:56.720]  but i think part of the reason i was skeptical is like well ar is just air is kind of like your
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:02.080]  phone but it's better in some ways but it's worse in other ways right like the idea of being able to
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:07.040]  put a phone away it's gonna have more power it's gonna have better battery and you know it's still
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:11.200]  like it's pretty darn portable right like the you know if i had to watch something on my face all
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:16.480]  the time etc etc it's like well ar is will be like the watch it's gonna be something sort of in
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:22.560]  addition to your in addition to your phone and and then i'm like well and i'd already sort of decided
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:26.000]  i mentioned this earlier that ar is going to be more important than vr vr is just going to be like
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:32.560]  video games and and and movies and sort of a different channel technology and i i think the
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:39.200]  big shift again is really this idea of work like work is the thing that makes me think that vr is
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:45.840]  going to be bigger than it might be otherwise and vr is not a successor to the phone it's a successor
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:52.000]  to the computer on your desk and that's the that's what's actually happening and it's going to be
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:57.040]  alongside your phone which you'll use when you're out and about but when you're in one spot and not
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:03.040]  going anywhere and you want to and you want to work vr is going to be better than the the
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:08.080]  computer on your desk i disagree but before i do let me take a break thank our next sponsor it's
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:14.080]  our friends at link look at that i'm like like a professional linkedin these days small business

[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:41.680]  pretty pretty good url to have it's not like linkedin.com slash go to talk show or something
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:46.960]  like that just linkedin.com slash talk all right i've been thinking about this i i think this shit
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:55.360]  about working with a vr headset on i i don't i it sounds like madness to me i i don't see i i think
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:02.640]  it's the more i think about it i think you were right originally i think vr is for games and for
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:10.240]  like the equivalent of watching a movie and after an hour or two it's it's too much it's over it's
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:16.640]  overwhelming i i i don't think people want to be immersed in their work that way i think that like
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:26.560]  the amount of your visual field that uh pro display xdr two pro display xdrs in front of your
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:33.520]  desk is about the most that anybody would want i i don't i just don't i like what happens if somebody
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:39.120]  you know like you are working from home it is your work i'm not going to say work from home is
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:43.520]  a thing but what happens like when somebody else in your family walks into the room and wants to
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:57.120]  talk i i i i and uh i i i i guess with a high enough resolution i don't want to say that we're
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:03.840]  never going to have a virtual display in front of you in a vr headset that is as good a resolution
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:10.240]  as an actual real display in a real world in front of you but we're so far away from that i i don't
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:16.240]  see how it it seems like a fantasy at this point and it does not to me seem like an appealing
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:23.280]  fantasy at all it seems it seems closer to the matrix where it's it's like a dystopia i know
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:27.520]  that that word gets thrown about with this very much when we're talking about science fiction
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:32.080]  ideas but that really you know if the idea is that you're going to put this helmet on
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:40.240]  or goggles and not even see your real world for six hours a day it it that does not seem desirable
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:44.400]  to me at all or what about like every time you want to go to the bathroom or refill your coffee
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:47.440]  all of a sudden you got to take this headset off take the headphones off
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:56.080]  it it it doesn't seem like it doesn't seem like an improvement over just having a display or a
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:03.680]  laptop in front of you at a desk that you can just stand up and walk away from it all sounds worse
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:10.000]  it's interesting because the when it comes to anything about working from home i'm always super
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:17.520]  hesitant to on one hand i feel like you and i have like too much experience with this right
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:21.280]  it's on one hand we're very good people to talk to because we've been working from home for ages
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:27.120]  uh on the other hand we're terrible people to talk to because we've like we were doing this
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:32.800]  before it was cool we have setups that we've figured out we have a whole routine with home
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:43.200]  etc etc so uh but alas you know we only have our own experiences but um i think the so first off
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:51.280]  i the the big question there's one so what i think there's a balance of benefits versus costs
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:59.280]  so i do think there's a real benefit in terms of things like meetings and things and the sort of
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:05.280]  like interacting with people and all the reasons like people want to be in the office like the the
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:09.600]  experience of having a meeting vr is pretty compelling and that's with technology right
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:14.560]  now that is still really crappy and and of course a caveat and you sort of mentioned this is the
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:21.200]  technology today is nowhere near ready for this to to sort of happen there are high-end headsets
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:27.520]  that have like 2000 by 2000 pixel screens for each eye uh you know whereas the oculus is not
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:35.920]  nearly or the quest 2 is not not nearly that high but the there is a real benefit in my estimation
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:41.280]  but the cost right now is i have to go get the headset put it on log in the meeting make sure
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:44.880]  my computer is connected so use my computer in the meeting it's like there's just a lot of
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:50.720]  there's a lot of friction involved and it's just that much easier just click a zoom link and yeah
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:55.920]  zoom's not the best experience uh you know it's good it works great that it's you know it's a
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:02.000]  well-written app but the actual media experiences you just sort of like zone off and look at twitter
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.600]  and oh wait sorry what'd you say you can say that again like all those sorts of things so
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:12.400]  that's that's the real clear i can see it today benefit of er zoom is not to go on too much of
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:19.360]  a tangent but zoom is a something i would pull apart to teach like in if i were teaching a human
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:27.360]  interaction like a ui design class in terms of taking the removal of friction to its extreme
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:32.000]  like as your number one priority they're there and they've said this you know i forget the the
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.600]  founder's name but i mean he said this very clearly that the whole reason they founded
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:39.680]  the company is that they were i think they were like cisco or something like that and they were
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:44.480]  like look at how how many clicks you have to make to get into one of these meetings and you have to
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:48.480]  wait for everybody else like what if it was just like one url and you just click the url and you're
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:54.240]  in and one person would be the meeting organizer and and set up the url and then let people in a
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:59.680]  room and then you're all in a room and it's like huh that actually and and for all of their problems
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:06.320]  software wise you know uh that that's why they won they won it didn't really matter that if you
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:09.760]  know you can argue this that the other thing that they did that wasn't technically great
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:15.200]  they had scandals where there was you know uh little micro scandals where where some of their
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:21.200]  traffic was seemingly being routed to servers in china and they weathered all of it because
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:24.640]  it's just a url that you click and all of a sudden you're in the meeting
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:30.160]  yep and it'll some of the scandals particularly around things with with the mac were related to
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:37.760]  them going to the extreme to make it as seamless as possible yeah yeah you know it uh yeah it's
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:43.360]  true but but the but it's fundamentally limited by the fact that it's still just a video call
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:49.120]  right and i and so again this is one where again a lot probably listeners might have to take me on
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:53.440]  faith like it it is a really compelling experience and it's again it's one of those things that's
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:15:00.400]  well that's hard to talk about because you're just viewing disembodied avatars that it's like why
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:05.600]  that doesn't look compelling at all uh but it is it is well think about it just from a practical
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:11.680]  standpoint of the actual experience if you're talking to one person on a video call it you've
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:16.640]  got the whole screen so let's say you're on a laptop which is you know what the machine most
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:22.240]  people use is something laptop size that's still plenty of attention that you could give one person
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:27.040]  and if you have two three people on the call you're one of them in real life and you have
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:32.080]  two people on your screen they each get half the screen and that's pretty good and as soon as you
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:36.880]  add one more person which would be a four person meeting which you know i think by most people's
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:42.080]  business experiences is not a lot of people in a meeting all of a sudden there's not a good way
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:47.440]  you know there's no good way to go three ways on screen you know it's all this all of a sudden
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:51.920]  people are getting tiny and if you have like six or seven people which again i don't think is an
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:59.520]  abnormal number of people for a typical business meeting um it you all of a sudden it's the brady
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:05.360]  bunch and everybody's just got a tiny little square and it's it's all squares yeah hollywood
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:13.360]  squares and and you know you get past that you know we we've had school meetings you know jonas's
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:19.600]  school has been you know he's back in school but all of the parental stuff is still virtual you
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:27.120]  know for covid related reasons um and so like the you know there'd be like meetings like oh all the
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:31.920]  senior class parents can you know we're gonna have a meeting for something back to school blah blah
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:39.200]  blah so dozens and dozens of parents so at that point it it's just a list of the school people
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:46.880]  on screen and all the parents are just sort of off off in the list you know you can chat and
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:52.960]  raise your hand right they added zoom did you know this do you use zoom yeah they added this
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:58.800]  horrible feature that i didn't know about and they turned it on by default where if you actually
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:04.880]  raise your hand in real life it raises your hand in the zoom meeting oh no that's a top that's
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:11.760]  awful i could not make this up and it's me and me and amy sharing an ipad to do the zoom meeting
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:16.000]  for the parents thing and they're like oh i see uh jonas's dad has his hand up and i was like no
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.040]  i don't what what are you talking about i didn't touch i didn't touch anything and i i it was it
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:28.080]  was horrifying uh but again that's the sort of thing it does not happen in real life right like
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:33.360]  i'm not accidentally going to be you know the the principal of the school isn't going to accidentally
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:39.360]  think that i have an important point to interrupt and make you know in like an auditorium right even
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:46.000]  with dozens and dozens of people um vr can definitely solve that to it it maybe not as
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.560]  well as the real world but it you know like the seven eight person meeting that's like the
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:56.400]  screenshot you included in your your stardecory article um it's like the perfect number of people
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:01.360]  where it's not unwieldy uh here i'll count them one two three four five well that's the thing
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:05.920]  though like real meetings 12 13 for a lot of companies real meetings aren't coming back
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:12.000]  right like they're like they they've committed to doing this like to to being sort of online only
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:18.800]  and so the comparison is not in-person meeting versus vr meeting the comparison is vr meeting
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:25.440]  versus zoom meeting and and again leaving aside all the issues of the technology today and putting
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:30.880]  it on when you're actually in the meeting it is a big difference and i think there's two important
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:36.880]  points to make number one is the again the part with horizon workers you can bring your computer
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:40.880]  into the meeting just brings it to a completely different level because it's like a real meeting
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:45.600]  where you have your computer there and you can be doing a powerpoint presentation you could be
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:51.920]  checking your email and and that makes like it it's that mixed part is super important number one
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:58.000]  but number two the when you're in a vr meeting and you're having a discussion and you do have better
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.560]  discussions because everyone you feel presence and the person you're right you hear it in your right
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:06.480]  ear and the person across from you you hear it there and like the 3d audio is super important
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:11.760]  for this sort of experience you don't you forget you're wearing a headset you i swear to god you
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:17.120]  really do you're just there you're in the meeting and so you're not like cognizant that i have this
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:23.600]  thing in my head it it's genuinely immersive and this is with crappy technology and you fast forward
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:28.880]  the technology five years and it's going to be like you're it's going to you're not going to
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:34.960]  notice you're wearing anything you're you're going to be in the virtual world and it's not going to
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:42.720]  be a cognizant i'm sitting in my chair and i have this thing in my head that is that's your physical
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:48.720]  sense speaking but like we are like the humans are like our minds are what distinguishes like
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:55.440]  like we we can be somewhere else and it delivers it delivers today with crappy technology and when
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:59.600]  the technology is 100 times better i'm pretty optimistic it's going to be pretty compelling
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:08.080]  i i'm i am moved by the argument about meetings but to me and again i haven't experienced one i
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:13.200]  i probably should figure out how to but uh uh what are you guys using your your team with passport is
[01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:17.600]  using uh the quest the quest to with the horizon work groups yeah i don't have a quest to i've got
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:24.640]  a uh that five thing here from jonas but um yeah i i should try it i mean but i i've used enough
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:29.520]  vr where i believe that i i i believe it in my imagination even though i'm deeply skeptical
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:37.680]  um about the the magnitude of vr changing this but to me what you're describing is like a modern
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:44.560]  day telephone where like let's say a hundred years ago whenever it was where the telephone really
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:50.560]  became like a hey everybody's got one in their house and every business has one and i could see
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:54.960]  somebody arguing well who the hell wants to stand there holding this thing against their ear and
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:21:00.480]  talking into a microphone and you only hear out of one ear who the hell wants to talk to somebody
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:06.880]  like that and of course you know in the 20th century and by the time you and i were born the
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:11.040]  telephone was ubiquitous and everybody was completely normal and nobody gave it any thought
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:16.080]  and people talked on the phone all the time and when i was a teenager that was you know pre-internet
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:21.600]  but post-telephone that was how we stayed in touch with friends when we weren't actually in
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:27.360]  contact it was you know completely normal and you got used to it but it was still small doses right
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:32.640]  it wasn't like all day like i i would never in a million years want to be on the telephone as long
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:39.120]  as i am on my mac in a typical work day that would it would drive i would i would actually go mad
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:45.440]  so yeah i think this is this is this is the point that i was doing a very roundabout way to get to
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:52.720]  so let's grant me that meetings are great right uh but there is a huge cost in working at your
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:57.360]  computer and then putting on a headset just for a meeting and so this is really the critical point
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:05.600]  is will just regular work writing or coding or whatever it might be will that be something that
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:15.040]  will that be something that is better in vr as opposed to a monitor on your desk and it's it's
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:23.040]  an open question without question for sure but i can definitely again so if you grant me the point
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:28.880]  that you can achieve a vr experience such that you forget you're wearing a vr headset and you
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:36.240]  feel completely sort of in the moment and and and presence and all those sorts of buzzwords and that
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:41.520]  and that does happen today with meetings i do think it's viable and i think your pushback's
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:47.440]  fair and you very well may be right but i do think it's viable to imagine that you can have the
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:52.880]  the desk setup of your dreams and you have eight monitors or you can have your data or whatever
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:58.720]  like right there in front of you in vr for just your regular work and your regular writing
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:05.440]  and it actually ends up being not just a similar experience but a better experience not just because
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:11.920]  the additional view space but also because when you're working and and i mean i think we've talked
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:15.680]  about this like when you're writing right you want to get in that state and you want to get in flow
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:20.400]  and you shut the door and you know tell you know tell the kids leave you alone and and once you're
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:26.400]  locked in you don't want to get knocked out of that and where the the sense that you get to
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:31.120]  actually go to another place just like you used to go to an office but now you're just going to
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:39.280]  a virtual place is something that's also going to be very attractive to people and then if you're
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:44.400]  already in that space then there is no cost in having a vr meeting because it's just literally
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:50.480]  clicking a button or going through a virtual door because you're already there and so i i'm
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:54.800]  skeptical that we and maybe certainly we have this half and half world i think it's probably
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:24:00.480]  going to be all all one or all the other and i think the argument's a fair one but i'm not sure
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:05.280]  but we can agree to agree to disagree and you know this is definitely an argument i this is
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:11.360]  one of my loosely held arguments right uh sorry if it's loosely held is what it is yeah i'm not
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:18.400]  sure you might be right but i i think again when not technology today but technology in five years
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:27.120]  or ten years let me ask you this what are your thoughts on the touch bar it's terrible why i i i
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:34.320]  because oh where to start well one you have to look at it which i'm sure is the point that you're
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:39.280]  you're you're you're seeing you're seeking from me uh it changes all the time it's not consistent
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:46.320]  uh it you hit it by accident you get no tactile feedback you know tactile feedback yep right so
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:53.120]  how is how is using an entire computer in vr not just the touch barification of everything
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:59.440]  of your entire human interaction model with everything you see i believe the seeing part
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:07.360]  and again if we just uh project forward to a high enough resolution headset i totally believe that
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:14.880]  we will have virtual displays in vr through a headset that are as good as or close to as
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:20.720]  or good enough to satisfy even a relatively picky person with pretty good eyes but in terms of every
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:27.360]  other aspect of computing without being able to actually touch any of it or see it i mean i
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:31.760]  theory you could have a physical keyboard in front of you that what you you orient your hands by
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:39.840]  you know like uh uh well let me jump in that like what no the the again this is where the
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:44.480]  workroom thing's really interesting your computer is in the vr space yeah but how do you see the
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:50.400]  keyboard how do you see the trackpad they show it they they project it into the space and then
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:54.240]  there's cameras on the outside of the quest too that are tracking your hands and so you can see
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:26:00.000]  your hands on the keyboard and i i think a recent update i haven't tried this out yet but where
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.120]  they're actually showing the actual letters on the keys that was in the real forward just had
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:07.040]  the keyboard but they only support like three keyboards now it's like they support the mac
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:11.360]  the mac books and then like one version of an external keyboard so they they have to actually
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:18.320]  work to support this sort of thing but your computer is there in in the environment with
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:24.400]  you again it's it's pretty crappy technology now but it's there and it's working i just don't see
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:29.680]  how that's better than having an actual display and it certainly seems more expensive um and a
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:34.160]  lot of other stuff and again if you can actually get the tracking and so it looks like your
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:39.600]  keyboard's right there and it looks like your actual fingers are right there and and not these
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:46.480]  disembodied hands that are sort of there but so many of the interaction things that facebook
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:55.760]  showed and everybody has fantasized about in in fictional ideas of the same thing over the years
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:02.480]  of having like an avatar touching things and you you can pull windows apart like you don't you know
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:07.440]  like you start getting more aggressive and imaginative with your future interface why
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:13.920]  why uh hold ourselves to the idea of a rectangular display that's in front of you showing the mac
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:19.360]  desktop or windows desktop why don't we have all these virtual items that you can just move your
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:25.520]  hands and and do and all of these things to me i i keep thinking about the touch bar and how happy
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:31.760]  everybody is that it's got people are happier that it's gone than i expected them to be like
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:37.520]  now that it's gone it's it's it's it's like saddam hussein falling like people are out dancing in the
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:44.160]  street and the touch bar is just this tiny little strip that replaced the least used keys on your
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:53.120]  keyboard and that's the whole i that's the whole model of of vr it's it it there's a total lack of
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:28:00.000]  tactile feedback that i feel is for some tasks right and and i could imagine for like
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:05.280]  showing off a 3d model in a shared meeting where you could just put your hand in front of it and
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:09.600]  spin it a little bit you don't need the tactile feedback because you're sharing it around
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:15.920]  a virtual round table meeting and you're just looking at this model of a device or something
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:21.040]  like that i there are certain interactions that i think already probably work well and could work
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:28.240]  better but to replace most day-to-day work i feel like the one thing that's really important
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:33.440]  feel like the one thing we've reiterated over the last five years is people like things that
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:40.800]  actually click and and they appreciate it it it's it's hard i mean i i mean again though like
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:47.520]  that's that's why this is why the the workroom things help change my mind about this like in
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:53.440]  bringing having your actual computer in a virtual reality space makes all all the difference in the
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:58.720]  world because i completely agree this idea you go somewhere and you're totally virtual and it's just
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:07.280]  like such a it's it's too stark a contrast from my like your actual word existence but the first time
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:12.400]  when like i i think i oh i can't say i've told this story because we're pretending like we've
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:17.920]  never told any stories previously but when i got demoed it by facebook and there was two people
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:24.160]  demoing it to me and the one person was walking through the features and the person next to him
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:29.600]  she was clearly doing email and not paying attention to our conversation and she was doing
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:33.440]  it because her computer was projected in the space her keyboard was there in the space and
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:37.280]  her fingers were actually touching her keyboard which is on the desk in front of her
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:45.920]  and one that's cool for her and two for me it made the meeting feel even more real because
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:50.400]  that's what people do in meetings right it's not this like oh we're like the microsoft teams i
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:56.320]  thought video was not actually was less impressive this regard because it was too ethereal it was too
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:30:01.760]  well we're in a virtual space like walking around doing high fives no like like actually
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:07.040]  imitating all what we think about the crappiest idea of meetings actually makes it that much
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:12.240]  more realistic and compelling uh do you mean microsoft i don't know if i saw the microsoft
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:16.960]  version but or you mean the facebook one where so microsoft microsoft last week had a keynote
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:20.480]  where they did they did some metaverse stuff too and so they're going to have basically a
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:25.200]  competitive product to horizon work rooms it's built around teams and i think it's very compelling
[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:29.920]  from a business perspective because teams is the sort of self-contained environment where if i i
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:34.720]  mentioned before like there's gonna be lots of individual metaverses like that your team's
[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:40.080]  instance and all the things that are attached to it and people haven't used teams like it's much
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:45.680]  it's a much bigger thing than slack like it like you can spend your whole day in teams like your
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:48.720]  documents open in teams and all your connections are in teams you have your video calls in teams
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:52.480]  it's like an all-encompass it's like microsoft's operating it's like windows for the cloud
[01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:58.640]  basically is is what it is and that lends itself to oh this is actually a virtual environment that
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:04.880]  you can be in and all your stuff is here and they're sort of already set up for it but one i
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:10.960]  don't think it hasn't shipped yet and i haven't used it and the the the promo video was too much
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:15.920]  people floating around in this idealized space when the real what what is compelling about
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:20.720]  horizon work rooms is the more that it feels real including all the crappy parts of a meeting
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:24.880]  the the better it is and the more interesting it is yeah everybody knows the person who's
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:29.360]  not paying attention but sort of has to be there right you know and they're but they
[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:33.200]  wear it on their shirt sleeve you know i mean if they're like pecking away at a computer or
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:37.680]  well and this is this is i this is one of the things where i i think this is one of
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:44.400]  facebook's hidden powers secret powers is facebook and maybe because they're completely
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:48.880]  they're so data-driven they have such a large audience what you know they're whatever you
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:53.520]  want to use if you want to be have a less charitable interpretation they give people
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:32:00.880]  what they want and they're like nuts they're not stuck on oh let's show this idealized meeting
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:06.560]  environment you know where people are having this these fun conversations and writing on the
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:11.680]  whiteboard and high-fiving and stuff like no you bring your computer in the space you sit around
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:16.480]  a table people who call in show up on a video screen there it's like this is the way people
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:22.320]  actually behave and we're going to sort of deliver on that and it makes it way more compelling
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:27.840]  well color me skeptical that people are going to want to wear a complete vr headset for more than
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:34.000]  a half an hour at a time i i just i and i don't think it's ever going to change but we shall see
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  all right i have a fourth and final bonus sponsor to thank oh it's our good friends at squarespace

[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:40.240]  um do you want to wrap up with the this ar vr thing uh i still think i don't think they're
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:44.720]  mutually exclusive right i think it's it's so i don't either i don't either at some point it's
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:50.000]  like talking about like audio versus visual and it's like well they both they kind of go together
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:58.320]  and and i i'm gonna keep calling facebook i can't call it meta but facebook emphasized
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:03.840]  it you know they they were very vr heavy in their presentation or let me just go back one segment
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:10.480]  here and just say the most disappointing thing to me about the facebook uh keynote was that they
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:16.320]  emphasized you keep telling me that they've got cool shit right now that you can get the quest to
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:23.840]  and have a really compelling experience and they didn't even show it they all they did we show
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:29.440]  fantasy stuff that they say they're building towards it was all just sort of like the worst
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:37.760]  of those concept videos that i love to complain about um like why not show me the real meetings
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:42.800]  first and say you know this is great right now you could do it today and this is something you
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:47.840]  you can actually buy this do it right now and then here's the idea of what we're building towards
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:53.120]  if you really wanted to stick in the concept video and then you can actually do it right now
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:58.000]  the concept video that i don't think you should have anyway but um by the way one point about
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:04.560]  the concept video it's interesting that covid worked in facebook's favor like of all the times
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:09.840]  to get away with doing a concept video yeah it's like when you're everything is a commercial so
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:15.600]  hey might as well go go all the way with it right they couldn't do this on stage it it it was just
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:19.920]  just sort of a side note that's sort of an interesting meta meta point about about that
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:25.200]  presentation no that is true i've i we again i'm not going to say that we talked about it but
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:33.520]  because i don't think we talked offline yeah maybe but it is interesting where uh i would argue that
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:38.640]  it was second only to apple and production values although i i watched a bit of the microsoft one
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:43.760]  and it seems like they've upped their production values too it seems like maybe that's sort of a
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:48.800]  thing that people are starting to like in the same way that you're talking about hey in-person
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:54.000]  meetings as the default meeting might be a thing of the past in-person keynotes maybe or at least
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.720]  for a while it seems like everybody's upping their production values on these things the facebook one
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:04.800]  was was second to apple in my opinion but it was different from apple where apples you can you can
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:11.840]  imagine how apples would translate to being on stage segment for segment right it's just you
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:19.040]  know just be on stage instead of in whatever settings they are um but like when they drop
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:24.960]  through the floor through the secret door to the secret lab where they pretend johnny suruji works
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:31.200]  you could just imagine johnny suruji coming out on stage and delivering saying the same things
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:36.080]  instead of being in a secret lab he'd he'd just be on stage saying those things whereas the facebook
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:44.000]  keynote wouldn't make sense on stage at all yep it really wouldn't um that is interesting um
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:51.920]  but it suckerbird they definitely played you know made much mention throughout of hey you don't have
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:59.760]  to have one of these vr headsets on to participate in all of this you know ar is going to be part of
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:06.640]  it we meaning we facebook are already you know working with ray ban on these sunglasses that
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:10.880]  you know they aren't really ar i think they just do the camera that's there's nothing special with
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:16.480]  the lenses they don't like project anything i don't think that's right yeah but um you know
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:21.120]  but it's a clear sign that they're thinking about it right i mean and it's it's obviously if there's
[01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:26.320]  any sort of commercial success with these the ray ban thing they're going to be working on a way to
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:34.080]  get some sort of google glass style in place heads-up display in front of your glasses
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:39.760]  widely rumored that apple is working on something like that you know that apple has
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:46.720]  at least two projects one for vr goggles that completely block you for you but that they're
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:54.320]  prioritizing eyeglasses that would obviously project some sort of heads-up display interface
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:39:00.160]  on your glasses um and they you know and that the you know to your point earlier that the phone
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:05.680]  isn't going away um that you you know if all you've got with you is the phone and somebody
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:09.440]  starts in a meeting you could just join in on the phone the way you can today
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:20.880]  yep but i think that a i think ar is one of those things that is going to become ubiquitous
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:28.800]  ubiquitous we're never it'll be with us in dozens of different ways but every time every piece of it
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:35.040]  becomes an actual viable successful commercial project we'll stop thinking of it as ar and it's
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:44.480]  just a thing i like air pods yeah exactly air pods i you know i guess the watch is not ar
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:50.160]  i mean the air pods can be but in the same way that the watch has sort of disappeared
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:54.640]  as a computer on your wrist and now it's just most of us just think of it as one way of doing
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:40:00.000]  a digital watch um i think that's going to start happening with things like the goggles
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:06.240]  um and you know in some degree i want to double on this i think you're i think the watch is ar
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:11.680]  and i think air pods are ar and i think your phone is ar like it is like it is augmenting the reality
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:18.320]  that you're around and and i think the glasses will very much fit in this but this is also the
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:24.720]  same reason why i think all of those will always be at least for a very long time subservient to
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:30.240]  the phone right like that that screen size is small enough for your pocket but big enough to
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:35.440]  actually get stuff done in a way is going to be hard if not impossible on ar for years the watch
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:41.520]  is too small and and all of these devices because you're wearing them and they're on your body
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:48.640]  to the extent they can offload processing and offload work to the phone which has a beefy processor
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:54.800]  as a big battery they're going to be so much thinner and so much lighter and so one i think
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:41:00.080]  apple has huge opportunities in this space and i like the apple watch is a huge success and i think
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:07.200]  their ar glasses are probably going to follow a similar path but i think it's not any sort of new
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:12.720]  platform or new paradigm it's it's extensions of the phone and and that's what i've always thought
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:18.640]  about ar and i still think that about ar so my my bullishness about vr is not because i become more
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:24.000]  bearish on ar it's i think ar is what i thought it was going to be before i just happen to think
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.680]  the vr opportunity is bigger than i realized previously but but to me it's always going to
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:32.480]  be phone centric and maybe you disagree with that i i but i have a hard time seeing at least in the
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:36.160]  near term a world where we're just wearing glasses and nothing else the phone has become the big
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:42.000]  computer right exactly no exactly exactly well i mean i wrote this ages ago about apple like
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:46.640]  apple's you know their monetization strategy is to sell iphone accessories like so they don't
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:50.080]  they increase the price of the iphone and you buy more iphone stuff and you think about it
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:54.960]  what do you have today if you're if you're an apple if you're an apple user you have the iphone
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:58.800]  which is now a thousand dollars or whatever it might be you probably you might have an apple case
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:04.000]  you you you have air pods you you have an apple watch and now you're going to have apple glasses
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:09.360]  and and it's all going to work together in the integrated way that apple excels at it's going
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:15.440]  to be light and sleek and and design like apple's note four and it's going to be powerful and have
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:20.400]  these chips that make it possible because apple's invested in that space like like i think that
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:28.000]  opportunity nothing has changed my mind about that i'm i'm skeptical as ever about anyone else
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:34.080]  beating apple here to be honest the um did you see uh stephen lee vie at wired had an interview with
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:41.120]  uh john hanky from uh i think his new tech yeah neon tech that's the pokemon go company and he's
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:51.440]  uh even more so than me staunchly pro ar and staunchly app anti vr and and i won't rehash
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:55.360]  his arguments to stephen lee vie but it's a lot of what i said where it's sort of dystopic to
[01:42:55.360 --> 01:43:00.960]  think about sitting there completely blocking out the real world sitting still and that human beings
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:09.920]  are meant to be out in the world and to feel things and um a huge problem with vr in my opinion
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:15.280]  for anything other than gaming where people are used to playing with a controller to move around
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:21.520]  right like if you play video games on a real display you you're used to you or like pc gamers
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:25.440]  use a mouse and a keyboard right but that's just if that's just turning your mouse and keyboard
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:33.280]  into a very fancy many button controller right yep you you your your fingers get dextrous
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:38.640]  and your coordination your hand eye coordinate hand finger coordination you know gets better as
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:44.640]  you get better at the game and in vr you do the same thing right like you sit still and you put
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:51.600]  the helmet on but like i've had vr experiences several times demos and it's like when they try
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:57.920]  to do things that aren't games as soon as you become immersed you start doing stupid things
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:03.280]  like taking steps in real you know like you move your real legs if you're standing up and of course
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:08.320]  that's you know you're like gonna walk into the wall or a desk or something like that and um like
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:15.120]  the commercial demos i've had with companies you know back when we go and have actual meetings you
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:20.720]  know they have they're ready for it they're ready for somebody you know doofus like me to start
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:24.800]  trying to walk because i've suddenly become immersed and they have somebody there to be
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:29.520]  you know like hold me by the shoulders and be like no no don't don't move you're at the wall
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:33.280]  but it's like a serious problem for anything other than video games where you're used to playing with
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:39.520]  a controller or a meeting where you're expected to be static like the difference between actually
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:46.560]  walking and moving around is it's not even in the it's not just like a different ballpark it's it's
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:50.720]  like a different universe this is a great point actually i should have added this this is another
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:55.280]  like everyone thought vr would be for games i'm pretty skeptical of vr and games uh and this is
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:45:02.320]  actually i think a better reason than some of the ones i came up with which is the there's a there's
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:09.280]  an uncanny valley sort of effect right whereas i think the vr experiences that replicate sitting
[01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:13.440]  in a chair are are much more compelling right whereas a game you're running around and now
[01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:17.120]  you're not running around it's kind of a weird experience i think that's spot on it's a it's a
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:23.280]  great great observation but and so like driving games great spaceship you know you're the pilot
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:29.280]  of a spaceship game that's great uh i'd still like to see phil schiller's uh like it came out
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:32.880]  i think it was at the trial that the epic trial where they were asking him about his experience
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:39.840]  with gaming and apparently he has some kind of like racing vr demo rig at his house or something
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:45.600]  like that probably pretty awesome uh that sort of thing there's some crazy vr senses out there
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:51.120]  that are like like ten thousand dollars and and and if that's your idea that you're supposed to
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:58.000]  sit there in a race car and and you get this immersive 360 degree you know viewing angle and
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:03.680]  as you move your head as the driver you you get this real-time feedback that's way better than
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:12.480]  playing a driving game on a you know flat display in front of you um so i'm i'm with it i don't know
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:17.280]  i'm kind of overall though i i feel like that's almost like a dedicated use though right it's like
[01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:24.320]  it it's not for gaming in general i don't know my son is sort of agree he and he's not ambivalent
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:28.960]  about it well i know ambivalence actually the exact word he's sort of like he's glad he has it
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:37.920]  but he he doesn't play it as anywhere near as much as it cost yeah whereas his actual gaming pc
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:43.760]  you know we got him a nice one he's played it way more whatever you know it whatever however
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:47.760]  much we thought he'd use it it's probably he's probably used it too much you know what i mean
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:55.600]  it is um but i thought the thing with oh go ahead no you go ahead first because i won't forget my
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:47:02.720]  point well i think the thing with the within the antech oh that's where i was going well you go
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:07.120]  first then i'll follow up i was just gonna say i think i've never played pokemon go i have no
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:13.920]  interest in it whatsoever but i get it uh and i think it's absolutely fascinating that it is
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:21.040]  so engaging to so many people for so long i mean not like long like they play 12 hours in a day
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:28.720]  but i mean like the game's been out for years now and people are still into it collection games are
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:33.440]  have a long a long history uh you know it actually is an interesting question are they
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:39.200]  sticking with it because it's ar because it's a just a really good collection game um i would
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:42.960]  i guess probably more more the latter than the former but i'm skeptical of anyone in ar other
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:48.720]  than apple to be honest uh snap is that building their own glasses they have like a developer
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:53.840]  version it costs thousands of dollars but it does they are ar glasses uh the neon tech is like gonna
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:48:00.320]  have like an sdk they want other people to ideally build to their specification etc etc the the big
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:08.720]  problem i see is apple apple's glasses are going to be privileged in the way they can access the
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:14.400]  phone with whereas like all these other companies your app's going to need to be open right and and
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:17.520]  that's just it you know you could say it's anti-competitive you can say whatever you want
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:21.920]  you can say it's the advantage of being the integrated player the fact of the matter is that
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:26.720]  no one else could build a watch like the apple watch and i don't think anyone's available
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:33.200]  glasses like apple's glasses and i just i i just think it's it's it's a foregone conclusion that
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:37.440]  apple's going to win that space with the if anyone brings compelling ar glasses to market
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:41.600]  it's going to be apple and again we'll see what happens on the android side but but i just think
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:45.680]  it's it's it's going to be just like the watch one of the interesting things with the watch and
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:52.720]  i think we could see it follow with the glasses is that apple has two advantages there's one there's
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:59.360]  the the home team integration with the phone which you just alluded to right and that nobody else
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:07.920]  gets system level access to the integration between the iphone and the watch and obviously
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:14.560]  android could do that right like samsung could could achieve the same level of home team
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:22.640]  integration with a samsung watch and a samsung phone and they've tried it so the more compelling
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:28.560]  the more the more interesting lead is that nobody seems to be able to match apple at making a tiny
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:35.920]  little computer that sits on your wrist that nobody nobody is better not samsung and i don't
[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:43.120]  even know who second place or third place would be can make a compelling computing device that
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:49.360]  comfortably sits on your wrist in a form factor that people would actually want to wear and now
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:55.520]  we're five or six years in you know we're up to series seven you know and nobody it's obviously a
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:50:00.640]  good business you know any of the questions like oh i think apple watches duds you know they can't
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:05.040]  launch a product without nobody talks like that anymore because everybody knows apple's making a
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:10.560]  ton selling apple watches to people but nobody else seems to be to be able to make anything
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:17.520]  compelling yeah i i completely agree and i think that you know i will see what happens at advantage
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:22.320]  of the long run i think there's interesting interesting indications that i think google
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:27.200]  and samsung are going to start partnering much more closely there's like there's the new google chip
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:33.040]  in the in the new pixel which is basic mostly a samsung chip with a little bit of google stuff
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:38.320]  on it it's is made by samsung uh something to keep an eye on i think is very interesting but i i i
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:44.720]  agree uh so yeah i i think they are i think it's gonna be a good business i think but i think it's
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:48.000]  gonna be like the apple watch right the apple watch isn't a transformative platform that is
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:52.560]  changing how we live and work and experience the internet right right like and so if there is going
[01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:58.400]  to be one i think it's going to be vr rather than ar it might not vr might always only ever be a
[01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:05.840]  niche but if i think one of the two change the way we experience the world i think it's going to be
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:11.520]  vr more than ar and that's a complete reversal from the way actually but it's not a big reversal
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:14.720]  my position before is that ar and vr are never going to be that big of a deal relative to the
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:21.200]  phone the phone is the king all be all my reversal is vr might actually be more important than i
[01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:25.680]  thought before um and you raise lots of good objections why it might not be but i you know
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:30.480]  we'll have to wait and see my i guess if i wanted to conclude and this is not a bad concluding
[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:38.320]  thought is that i think that the the proponents of vr see a path technology wise forward where
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:44.160]  it's just headsets in front of you things in front of your eyes and headphones in your ears
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:52.240]  to create a an immersive experience visual and audio experience that's so immersive that you
[01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:57.520]  think you're really there and like i said i've been immersed enough where i've accidentally
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:02.400]  tried to take a step like you you get disoriented and you you get ahead but you'd never fool yourself
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:10.160]  into thinking you're really there and i but i feel like there's there's a an idea and zuckerberg seemed
[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:17.120]  to really be trying to sell it in the keynote that there's a path forward along that route to get
[01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:22.720]  to the matrix where you actually you're 100 convinced you're there and it's just like real
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:27.280]  life and i don't think that's going to happen i think i think that sort of thing literally would
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:32.480]  take it has nothing to do with putting goggles or headphones on but would require some sort of
[01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:38.240]  actual neural connection some sort you know whether it's actually physical you know like
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:43.520]  in the matrix where they put like a oh some kind of socket in the back of your head or you have
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:48.480]  like special gloves that are something that gives tactile feedback right or some sort of technology
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:56.880]  that lets the computer communicate with your brain over uh rays you know what i mean yeah like
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:02.560]  right well they have that crate have you seen that crazy watch technology or wrist technology
[01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:08.880]  they have yes yeah where were they they yeah so there's there's some crazy stuff out there but
[01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:15.920]  i yeah this is why and this is the like this is why i think it's work like i think work is the
[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:21.840]  it's the one environment like you're sitting at your desk you actually you want to be somewhere
[01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:27.120]  else other than where you are i mean you get just in the moment like like mentally speaking you like
[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:32.000]  you want to be focused on work you don't want to be you focus on things around you and there's the
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:37.280]  there's a go-to-market where if it's actually that useful and that much better you could see
[01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:42.480]  employers paying for it and just like they paid for pcs in the 80s like like all the other use
[01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:47.680]  cases for vr stumble i feel on some of those like the gaming one i thought we we broke it down
[01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:52.080]  pretty well like there's there's just some real limitations there there's like social networking
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:55.600]  and play the friends well then all your friends have to get a vr headset like oh are you are you
[01:53:55.600 --> 01:53:59.760]  going to actually accomplish that you're always going to go down to the lowest common denominator
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:03.920]  and the and you know what how do you convince people that there's something they want to pay
[01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:10.160]  for it i that's why i just come back to the enterprise angle and one i think that's the if
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:16.080]  it works that's where it's going to work and then the question is will it work there and i
[01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:22.080]  feel pretty strong about the first one that that work is the best manifestation in a place where
[01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:27.120]  vr could genuinely be better and the second one i i i weakly think that it's the case but i think
[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:32.240]  your objections are are very reasonable and and we'll see we'll have to see what happens well
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:37.440]  this was uh as good a discussion as i think we could have hoped to have i'm glad you joined me
[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:43.760]  um i hardly ever talk to you anymore yeah well it's actually good we actually talked about a
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:47.440]  fair bit of things that were different than we've talked about in dithering because we talked a lot
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:53.920]  about like zuckerberg being a founder and like that sort of bit and um whereas this was i think
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:58.480]  much more about the beaten potatoes so yeah i think that people that listen to both won't feel bad
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:05.840]  uh for people who do enjoy listening to us talk together and you haven't tried it you can find
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:11.040]  ben and my uh our our joint show which is now what where are we in about 18 months
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:20.640]  uh yeah we're like well over 200 episodes yeah dithering.fm and it is uh five dollars a month
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:27.040]  which is an insane bargain uh or uh 50 bucks a year is that right you could that's right
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:31.760]  50 bucks a year discount and then what's what's our pitch it it is a complete opposite of this
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:39.280]  show form wise 15 minutes an episode not a i think it this is where you get confused because
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:43.200]  we actually do not a second less not a second more but i think the pitch is not a minute more
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:48.000]  not a minute less this is the worst but this is the worst butchering in the history they
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:53.200]  had to get some sort of reward for this yeah that's right it's uh two episodes per week
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:59.120]  15 minutes per episode not a minute less not a minute more but we we're that that is under
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:05.840]  promising and we over deliver because we we don't do a second less or a second more each
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:14.000]  episode is 15 colon most of the time the because we uh we barco bless his heart makes this this
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:19.280]  product called forecast that lets you sort of like add show art and and you know just do things to
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:26.080]  your mp3 pile yeah uh it because why would he care about making sure it's super precise to the to the
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:33.200]  second uh the latest version will occasionally knock a second off i'm not sure why and so i'm
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:37.680]  actually using an old version of it because that doesn't knock the second off but when when you
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:43.280]  get an episode that is 14 59 uh tweet up marco don't tweet at us have you ever reported this
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:49.920]  marco we need to we need to get a i think we paid a fortune we paid an absolute fortune for a
[01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:55.120]  forecast license that's right i mean the uh the zero dollars for the download the new one and
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:57:01.760]  then the time spent to dig up the old one anyway uh it's a great tool i actually we use it because
[01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:06.720]  for the secretary because i record a prize for secretary and we blow it out like there's show
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:11.680]  notes and like like every time i reference an image that's the show image when i do an article
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:16.560]  it shows like a screenshot of the article like so and that's all forecast forecast makes it super
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:23.120]  easy so i'm actually a huge fan and a huge user so uh this was meant to uh it meant good fun i
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:28.800]  do the same thing with it and with the chapters right and the chapters are huge and i it's so
[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:33.600]  great for going back to older shows i wanted to refer back to an episode of the show from
[01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:40.400]  earlier this year that my show and i knew it was with christina warren but i could actually
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:45.040]  all i had to do is just go into it and forecast or i could have gone to a podcast player to find
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:48.560]  the episode because the chapters are the same and then just tell people it's oh it's at the
[01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:54.880]  one minute 32 mark and yep never would have never wasn't possible with all the pre-forecast episodes
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:58:03.600]  of the show so now you have me feeling bad for griping anyway i know thank you ben talk to you
[01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:10.800]  later
