[00:00.000 --> 00:02.440]  How's your week anything going on?
[00:03.640 --> 00:09.200]  On one level. Yes a whole lot and on another level absolutely nothing. So, you know, thank you
[00:10.600 --> 00:13.940]  Absolutely nothing. It's the I can't even there's nothing on my mind
[00:16.480 --> 00:19.160]  Boy seems like every day is the same as the last
[00:20.680 --> 00:22.960]  Holy hell, you know
[00:22.960 --> 00:25.880]  We were looking forward to my daughter coming home for spring break next week
[00:25.880 --> 00:32.040]  And instead my daughter is now home to do her online finals and then she'll be here for a month at least
[00:32.640 --> 00:37.120]  So yeah, she's happy. She's so through in nothing like having your freshman year
[00:37.840 --> 00:44.160]  Like switched off and kicked back to your parents. I don't know. Well, what do you all right? You're a college student
[00:44.240 --> 00:49.980]  What's are all of this is bad and and let's just let me just say this as a preamble that number one
[00:50.520 --> 00:53.920]  We are recording on Monday, March 16th
[00:53.920 --> 00:55.920]  at at
[00:56.360 --> 00:57.680]  630 p.m
[00:57.680 --> 01:03.960]  Easter dive 3 Pacific and who the hell knows what the world will be like by the time this podcast gets out the door
[01:04.120 --> 01:07.920]  But who knows what it'll be like by the time we finish from the recording, right? Yeah
[01:08.920 --> 01:16.440]  Good point. Very good point. I honestly thought the first person who I heard say that was there's a great restaurant guy here in Philly
[01:16.440 --> 01:23.240]  Mark Vetri and his is he has a couple restaurants now, but is or no not Vetri it was
[01:24.240 --> 01:27.400]  Well Vetri was quoted too, but there's a couple of restaurant guys
[01:27.400 --> 01:29.600]  But one of them was I think I might have been Vetri was quoted
[01:29.800 --> 01:33.380]  Everybody was saying everything's changing day by day and he goes no, it's changed an hour by hour
[01:33.760 --> 01:38.380]  Yeah, and that is it only for now who knows minute by minute
[01:40.160 --> 01:42.320]  Anyway, let me just say as a preamble that
[01:42.320 --> 01:49.520]  This coronavirus thing and it is could not be more serious. It is hitting everybody
[01:49.520 --> 01:51.520]  I don't I can't imagine I
[01:52.400 --> 01:56.600]  Guess if you're a listener and in South America somewhere, you know
[01:57.480 --> 01:59.880]  There's some places where it seems like it hasn't hit yet
[01:59.880 --> 02:05.280]  But you know, it's as we all know from Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson. It's already hit Australia
[02:05.800 --> 02:10.520]  Very hard to believe that there's anybody who's going to listen to this episode who's not affected
[02:10.520 --> 02:12.480]  Hasn't had their life
[02:12.480 --> 02:16.080]  Affected in some way and and I think we all agree right at the beginning of it
[02:16.080 --> 02:18.640]  I don't mean to make light of it. I think it's very serious
[02:18.640 --> 02:20.720]  I think my coverage of daring fireball is very serious
[02:20.720 --> 02:25.100]  But I also know that people want to listen to podcasts and they want to get their mind off this and if we joke around
[02:25.320 --> 02:29.720]  Some ways it's in no way to be taken as treating this whole thing
[02:30.360 --> 02:32.600]  Lately, you know, we're all in the same boat
[02:32.600 --> 02:38.480]  I mean more so than perhaps at any other point in our lives right like the whole world is pretty much
[02:38.480 --> 02:44.320]  In exactly the same situation here. Yeah at some point back. I believe I believe it was
[02:45.040 --> 02:49.600]  Because I was certainly back then I believe it was back when I was doing the show with Dan Benjamin. I
[02:52.280 --> 02:58.440]  Sarcastically or son even sarcasm, but just smart acidly claimed that I never washed my hands
[02:59.960 --> 03:03.840]  In the same way that I claimed that I'd had my driver's license revoked at some point
[03:03.840 --> 03:09.920]  Yeah, well, you know Dan's a germaphobe. So yeah, I just say that and he would start itching I think right?
[03:09.920 --> 03:14.840]  That was exactly the reason and and then friend of the show Daniel jalkett made a song about
[03:15.360 --> 03:20.000]  About me quoting my my life. I should actually see if I can dig that up
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.920]  Maybe we'll have a theme song for this episode. Maybe maybe everybody listening to me say this right now
[03:24.920 --> 03:28.560]  we'll have already heard it maybe if we find it will stick it at the beginning of the show, but
[03:28.560 --> 03:36.600]  Believe it or not. It was not true at the time and it is as I feel my
[03:37.440 --> 03:41.920]  Pristine hands right now it is. Mm-hmm. It is definitely not true now
[03:42.960 --> 03:46.480]  We are washing hands. We're taking this seriously. We are buggered in
[03:47.120 --> 03:49.120]  Yep
[03:49.920 --> 03:53.880]  Yeah, so what is your college student freshman year Wow, what a bummer
[03:53.880 --> 04:01.320]  I just off the top of my head though. If you're a college student the two seminal years are of course freshman year and senior year
[04:01.320 --> 04:06.960]  You know the middle years kind of blur together, which is worse to have interrupted. I would think maybe senior year
[04:06.960 --> 04:08.240]  I I would think so
[04:08.240 --> 04:08.960]  I would think so
[04:08.960 --> 04:15.200]  I mean they did one of the differences is presumably you're off campus your senior year like like Jamie's in the dorm right now
[04:15.200 --> 04:22.640]  And I'd like to talk about all right really intensely close group of people like that's probably not what you want
[04:22.640 --> 04:27.040]  It's having all those hundreds of college students in close proximity
[04:27.560 --> 04:32.520]  And but senior year you're off campus. I mean, maybe you even stay in your apartment or whatever
[04:32.880 --> 04:37.240]  But yeah, you're losing your end of your college life
[04:37.240 --> 04:41.520]  And by the time things get back to normal if you know, whatever that normal is
[04:42.400 --> 04:48.960]  You're out of there presumably and you may not even get a graduation ceremony, right? Like I think almost certainly not right
[04:48.960 --> 04:54.680]  I mean, it's yeah, I mean unless they do like a makeup and it's never gonna be the same right? Although it's funny
[04:55.840 --> 04:58.800]  Because we always have to talk about sports at least a little bit to offend people
[04:59.880 --> 05:04.760]  One thing I read is that the NCAA is actually thinking of restoring some eligibility to some athletes
[05:04.840 --> 05:09.240]  Which is an interesting idea that maybe some of the spring athletes, you know
[05:09.240 --> 05:12.240]  You get your four years and then you're done and you can't compete
[05:12.400 --> 05:18.320]  It's possible that some athletes who thought this was their last year are now going to be granted another year and then come back and compete
[05:18.320 --> 05:24.280]  Next year again, which would be I think that that is the thing that they absolutely should do because
[05:24.920 --> 05:30.360]  For some of these people like this is you know, they've lost their chance and they're not gonna get it back
[05:30.360 --> 05:35.120]  But maybe they'll get you know, another another year to do some of this stuff
[05:35.120 --> 05:39.360]  but because I've been thinking about that for for Jamie about like I
[05:39.880 --> 05:43.220]  Mean, I assume she's gonna keep taking her courses in the spring
[05:43.220 --> 05:49.720]  Even if they end up being all online you could just opt out but then you're a quarter behind of everybody else
[05:49.720 --> 05:53.780]  And who knows the the online courses might be easier. All right
[05:53.780 --> 05:57.720]  I don't know we who knows but it's just disruptive and yeah
[05:57.720 --> 06:02.720]  If you're see your senior year and you're rolling through and you're this is your last hurrah, and then there's no hurrah like that's it
[06:03.560 --> 06:07.280]  School feel bad for them K through 12 schools are canceled
[06:07.280 --> 06:13.000]  Yeah, I believe two weeks here in power, Pennsylvania
[06:13.000 --> 06:18.460]  Not even Philadelphia just don't statewide. My sons are also your sons at the same age
[06:18.460 --> 06:21.280]  It's it's two weeks, but we look at it more like guys
[06:21.280 --> 06:24.360]  There's I mean it's gonna be a month at least and probably more than that
[06:24.360 --> 06:28.560]  And it might even be the rest of the school year like but they're just they're not gonna commit to that yet
[06:28.560 --> 06:32.860]  But it's who knows so so my son Jonas came home
[06:33.240 --> 06:36.600]  Friday and I thought he had a really unique perspective on it
[06:36.600 --> 06:39.720]  I mean it was obviously a major topic of conversation
[06:40.480 --> 06:41.840]  with his
[06:41.840 --> 06:47.500]  You know the whole school and in fact, so he they announced it on Thursday
[06:47.500 --> 06:52.320]  But they said but we're still gonna have school Friday, but it was a totally different schedule
[06:52.320 --> 06:52.920]  I don't know
[06:52.920 --> 06:58.820]  I mean I was it what they did is they rejiggered the schedule so that every kid would have every class on Friday
[06:59.160 --> 07:00.480]  Right whether it was you know
[07:00.480 --> 07:06.520]  Usually only on Tuesdays or whatever so that every teacher could get some time with the kids to say here's our plan
[07:06.800 --> 07:11.840]  Going forward for what we're gonna do with the remote education. It seemed like a good idea
[07:11.840 --> 07:14.360]  We're announcing this a day early everybody come in
[07:14.360 --> 07:19.160]  we're gonna have a one day with like 30 minute classes with each teacher blah blah blah, but they obviously had a lot of time to
[07:19.160 --> 07:21.160]  talk about it and
[07:21.640 --> 07:24.720]  Jonas came home and said him amongst him and his pals and
[07:24.720 --> 07:29.680]  His Latin teacher who's seems I've met with
[07:31.080 --> 07:35.580]  One of the parent-teacher things and did seem like a very clever fellow
[07:36.880 --> 07:40.040]  Or of the opinion that they're they're not coming back
[07:40.520 --> 07:42.420]  and I
[07:42.420 --> 07:47.780]  thought it was a really interesting perspective because it seemed it wasn't like like a
[07:49.120 --> 07:52.280]  We're done with school for the year it I thought it was
[07:52.280 --> 07:57.200]  It just talking to him about why they thought it it was very much informed by
[07:57.720 --> 08:02.520]  Their lack of preconceptions, you know that they're only you know, 15 16 years old
[08:03.200 --> 08:07.960]  Whereas I'm you know 47 and the way the world works is when something goes wrong at school
[08:07.960 --> 08:13.400]  They get the kids back in school as soon as possible, you know, you know, there's big snowfall on the roof collapses
[08:13.400 --> 08:19.060]  You know, well, they fix the roof and ten days later. The kids are back in school or there's a fire or something
[08:19.060 --> 08:23.660]  You know, well, we're gonna you know, nobody comes to school for a week because you know
[08:23.660 --> 08:26.020]  We've got to fix this water damage from the fire
[08:26.620 --> 08:28.320]  Then you come back to school
[08:28.320 --> 08:35.380]  Whereas without the preconception of this doesn't happen that schools close in mid-march and the school year is just over
[08:36.180 --> 08:38.180]  when you look at
[08:38.580 --> 08:43.140]  What's likely ahead it does seem likely like the gist was they you know
[08:43.140 --> 08:49.100]  They were like at a whiteboard and they were like, you know, the the peak is obviously gonna come peak infections
[08:49.100 --> 08:55.060]  It's obviously gonna come in mid-april to end of April and if that's the peak how you know
[08:55.060 --> 08:58.820]  Isn't it? It's not gonna fall off a cliff. It's gonna taper off like how
[08:59.940 --> 09:05.840]  You know and if wherever we are on the curve, however, you know, however close putting hundreds of
[09:06.580 --> 09:11.780]  Teenagers together and having 30 in a room and all of that. It's just like that's the last thing you want to be doing
[09:11.780 --> 09:13.780]  All right. It just seems like
[09:14.140 --> 09:17.740]  Really wishful thinking to announce. This is as a two weeks thing
[09:17.740 --> 09:22.660]  I thought it was really telling last night when the Vegas it's very strange to me
[09:22.660 --> 09:27.900]  I predicted last night that the Caesars ones would follow so the win and encore in Las Vegas
[09:28.700 --> 09:34.300]  Which are just two but they're big and right and you know top tier
[09:34.900 --> 09:37.580]  Announced that they were going to shut down tomorrow Tuesday
[09:38.300 --> 09:39.940]  and
[09:39.940 --> 09:42.300]  The end of a lot all the Bellagio ones, right?
[09:42.300 --> 09:42.580]  Yep
[09:42.580 --> 09:47.020]  all the Bellazzi MGM group the Bellagio once followed about an hour later and
[09:47.300 --> 09:53.980]  Then all the other ones every other property on this strip that you've ever heard of is in the Caesars Palace group
[09:53.980 --> 10:00.580]  And I just assumed that they would follow and I was like read checking this afternoon and apparently not but they're yet
[10:00.580 --> 10:02.580]  They're laying off employees
[10:02.580 --> 10:07.580]  It's very strange. I mean, I don't know if they're gonna I don't know how long they think they can ride this out
[10:07.580 --> 10:11.740]  But it seems like a bad idea to me. Yeah, you just threw throughout this, you know
[10:11.740 --> 10:17.860]  And I keep coming back to like the stages of grief that there's that there's kind of denial and bargaining and there's finally acceptance
[10:17.860 --> 10:23.740]  And and I've seen that here that when you don't have a plan written down that is here is our global pandemic plan
[10:23.740 --> 10:29.580]  Which nobody really has I mean there are some almost nobody has you end up in this sort of like well
[10:29.780 --> 10:33.780]  Maybe we can ride it out and then you can see the steps like and then the next one is well
[10:33.780 --> 10:35.900]  Maybe we'll change a little bit and then realize well
[10:35.900 --> 10:40.900]  We're gonna have to change for a little while and then finally you get to the point where it where you realize now we need
[10:40.900 --> 10:44.380]  to shut everything down and we just need to all sit here for a couple of months and
[10:45.380 --> 10:52.220]  And but it takes time because like I mean how disruptive is it to say we're not gonna do the NCAA basketball tournament
[10:52.460 --> 10:56.660]  They were like we'll play it in front of empty crowds and then finally the next literally the next day
[10:56.660 --> 10:58.660]  They're like, no, we're not gonna play right next day
[10:58.700 --> 11:04.420]  Well, and then I read I was reading the Las Vegas Review-Journal this morning and they had these amazing photos and they're like, okay
[11:04.420 --> 11:10.260]  Yes, it's eight thirty nine o'clock in the morning on a Monday and the strip is never busy at nine in the morning on a
[11:10.260 --> 11:16.460]  Monday, but it's not like this and it is like, you know, it's like scenes that
[11:17.020 --> 11:19.020]  ILM would have to put together, you know
[11:19.620 --> 11:23.300]  See the no cars on the Vegas Strip. It's just insane
[11:23.300 --> 11:26.700]  And but then the reporter was like, you know then but you know
[11:26.700 --> 11:32.980]  How so Harris is one that's still within the Caesars group and they were like Harris was mostly empty except for six players
[11:32.980 --> 11:37.980]  Crowded around a craps table and I'm like, look I like to play craps
[11:37.980 --> 11:44.340]  I like to gamble but in addition to the fact number one all of the table games involve chips going back and forth, right?
[11:44.780 --> 11:49.420]  Like I put out a chip the dealer takes the chip you get paid and you get in chips
[11:49.420 --> 11:54.220]  Yeah, there's a lot of touching the chips there but craps craps is literally passing dice
[11:55.900 --> 11:57.900]  Everybody gets a turn to throw them like
[11:57.900 --> 12:04.300]  Oh my god, I had to go I had to go to CVS today and pick something up and even with Apple Pay and we'll get
[12:04.300 --> 12:09.980]  We can get to this later, but Apple Pay is pretty cool in a in a hey watch what you touch situation, right?
[12:09.980 --> 12:15.620]  Like it's always seemed kind of cool that there's no touching involved, but now it seems
[12:16.220 --> 12:17.740]  magic
[12:17.740 --> 12:22.820]  But at it because it was a prescription pickup I had to sign for it and guess what I had to sign with
[12:22.820 --> 12:29.740]  that one of those one of those plastic pens attached to the thing and I felt like I've I
[12:29.740 --> 12:32.460]  Almost turned into Larry David. I was just like
[12:34.460 --> 12:39.100]  I signed I signed and then I just kept my right hand up
[12:39.100 --> 12:44.060]  I actually had to use my left hand to put my phone back in my right pocket and I just kept my and
[12:44.380 --> 12:48.140]  Of all the stores of all the stores in Philadelphia
[12:48.140 --> 12:52.540]  Which is the one store that doesn't have free hand sanitizer at the entrance?
[12:53.020 --> 12:54.860]  CVS
[12:54.860 --> 12:59.620]  How is that possible that a pharmacy does not have free hand sanitizer?
[12:59.900 --> 13:05.900]  But I knew that there's a little grocer a great little family-owned grocery store right around the corner de Bruno Brothers
[13:06.620 --> 13:11.020]  Which is doing a fantastic job in all of this absolutely fantastic job
[13:11.020 --> 13:15.020]  I knew it so I just I'm like walking around with my right hand up in the air
[13:15.020 --> 13:21.220]  Going a block and a half. Yeah to get and I I like went over there after using that pen hand sanitized
[13:21.740 --> 13:23.260]  before I
[13:23.260 --> 13:29.500]  Hand sanitize I did like a pre hand sanitizer hand sanitizer watch cuz I feel like that pen
[13:29.500 --> 13:33.820]  I mean, I was like, how how are you making people use this pen? This is I
[13:34.340 --> 13:37.460]  Went to Whole Foods a couple of days ago
[13:37.460 --> 13:42.700]  And I like brought my own bag put all the stuff in the bag dumped it out at the cashier
[13:42.700 --> 13:49.100]  Contactless, you know Apple pay walked out. I don't need the receipt, right? Right and and I managed to do it
[13:49.100 --> 13:52.500]  And and I do wonder in the long run, you know
[13:53.020 --> 13:58.420]  We're gonna get some interesting new cultural practices out of this that that we're thinking people are gonna be like
[13:58.420 --> 14:02.580]  Why don't we reduce the amount of touching that happens? Like maybe that's a good idea
[14:02.580 --> 14:08.780]  I I think contactless payments may be one of those places where everybody's like, why did we not just completely lean into this?
[14:08.780 --> 14:09.780]  I don't want to touch anything
[14:09.780 --> 14:15.180]  I think we're all gonna get a little more conscious about all of this stuff now having lived through it
[14:15.180 --> 14:17.180]  Yeah, there's and there have been a couple of places
[14:18.900 --> 14:22.380]  That I've seen smaller places here in Philly not like I'm out much
[14:22.380 --> 14:26.460]  But I have seen places and there's even some places that have the sign in a window that we're saying
[14:28.020 --> 14:31.620]  Credit cards, please. Yeah, because they don't want cash, right?
[14:32.820 --> 14:37.180]  But I saw I was I was buying dog food today. That was my one thing
[14:37.180 --> 14:45.300]  and the lady in front of me wanted to pay with cash and she's and it's like seven dollars and seven cents and she's like
[14:45.300 --> 14:48.980]  Oh, I think I have seven cents and she's digging and everybody around
[14:48.980 --> 14:55.620]  you know in our little three yard bubbles is looking at each other like are you kidding me and she's like gets it all out and
[14:55.620 --> 15:00.420]  I'm looking at the cashier. I'm like, well, I hope you got it. Just a vat of hand sanitizer back there, buddy
[15:01.420 --> 15:06.540]  Yeah, and then and then she's she's still busy like putting all the cash in and she's like, oh my gosh
[15:06.540 --> 15:12.980]  she's still busy like putting her money away in her in her in her in her purse and I have already tapped my Apple Pay
[15:12.980 --> 15:17.700]  Picked up the 45 pounds of dog food and then walking around her to get out of there, right?
[15:19.700 --> 15:26.620]  You know what and I think that for the most part, you know, usually and the distance on Apple Pay is is you know
[15:26.620 --> 15:30.340]  Pretty generous, you know, it's one of those technologies and again
[15:30.340 --> 15:34.340]  I never really thought about it a lot until this last week
[15:34.340 --> 15:36.340]  but it's
[15:36.780 --> 15:43.180]  The NFC distance or I think it's NFC right? Most of these terminals is the technology is NFC. Yeah, it is
[15:44.380 --> 15:49.020]  It doesn't require you to get close enough that you're worried about touching but you know
[15:49.020 --> 15:55.100]  It's not so generous that you have to worry about it happening accidentally when you're not even that close, right?
[15:55.100 --> 15:58.620]  It's it seems like the distance is just right, you know six inches
[15:58.820 --> 16:03.260]  Maybe three four inches at the closest and ping you're done
[16:03.260 --> 16:07.780]  It is just apps as a as I mean, everybody's a germaphobe at this point
[16:09.220 --> 16:14.500]  Yep, everybody should be I can't decide whether all the germaphobes are nodding like yeah
[16:14.500 --> 16:17.700]  I told you or if they were too busy like in a corner somewhere
[16:18.500 --> 16:22.340]  I mean, it can't do it. I don't know. Meanwhile, there's six guys playing craps it
[16:24.980 --> 16:26.980]  Yeah
[16:26.980 --> 16:33.380]  You gotta laugh to keep from crying sometimes. Oh my god, where do we start? What else is going on?
[16:33.380 --> 16:36.180]  What's going on in in your daily life?
[16:37.580 --> 16:39.580]  You guys bunkered in
[16:40.380 --> 16:48.100]  Yeah more so my wife works at a library full-time and they closed it over the weekend and
[16:48.740 --> 16:50.740]  Today was a staff day
[16:50.740 --> 16:58.700]  where they're supposed to come in and sort of figure out what they could do when they're not open to the public and
[16:59.220 --> 17:03.620]  By noon today. So again hours pass and things change by noon today
[17:03.620 --> 17:11.060]  We had been given all the Bay Area counties a shelter-in-place order, which is usually used for things like toxic gas leaks
[17:11.620 --> 17:13.620]  Basically said no non-essential
[17:14.260 --> 17:17.780]  Movement so, you know the in other words she's gonna be home tomorrow
[17:17.780 --> 17:24.180]  There's no way that they're still gonna be in the library unless the city government decides. The library is an essential emergency operation
[17:24.180 --> 17:31.140]  Which seems unlikely and so then we'll all be you know, we'll all be in here just locked in here and for me
[17:31.140 --> 17:36.300]  It's funny because this is where I work like you and I so many of our peers already work from home
[17:36.300 --> 17:42.100]  So it's not as disruptive to us. But you know, everybody else in my family has been disrupted directly by this
[17:42.100 --> 17:44.100]  So that's you know day to day
[17:44.100 --> 17:49.860]  I don't know we're starting to figure it out now that that what does it mean that you know Jamie's home and she's doing her finals
[17:49.860 --> 17:52.580]  And what you know, what's Julian doing in terms of his?
[17:53.380 --> 17:59.380]  His high school work and what is the which teachers know how to use email and which teachers don't know how to use email
[17:59.380 --> 18:05.300]  There's a lot of that. There's some tech savvy teachers and some really not savvy teachers. And yeah, I don't know
[18:05.300 --> 18:10.420]  It's it's that's that's where we are. So it's it's weird and like you said every hour and a half
[18:10.420 --> 18:15.620]  Every day, it seems like there's something something new and different and changing about it. So I don't know
[18:15.620 --> 18:20.580]  I mean it I assume are you all just bunkered in too? Yeah bunkered in with our
[18:21.540 --> 18:28.180]  500 pounds of charcoal so we're also nice. Also, you know Jonas pointed out. I mean we're you know
[18:29.380 --> 18:32.340]  We are as of as a threesome
[18:33.220 --> 18:36.820]  Rather naturally suit. This isn't that different than what we like to do
[18:36.820 --> 18:44.660]  Like it's like when we have no family oblique other obligations like for us a nice weekend is often just
[18:45.220 --> 18:47.220]  entirely spent at home
[18:48.900 --> 18:51.780]  It it's not that different for us
[18:54.100 --> 18:56.420]  And we're not on top of each other we've got plenty of space
[18:56.980 --> 19:02.020]  I do where I've worked for home on most of my adult life and non-stop
[19:02.020 --> 19:07.140]  Since I don't know god at least
[19:07.140 --> 19:10.260]  20 years for the most part some very small exceptions. Um
[19:13.060 --> 19:20.100]  It's you know, but it's the hour by hour differences are just crazy like literally this morning so
[19:20.980 --> 19:23.620]  Sunday night or sunday yesterday
[19:24.260 --> 19:25.380]  sunday
[19:25.380 --> 19:28.500]  New york city announced that they were going to close at the end of the day
[19:28.500 --> 19:34.420]  sunday new york city announced that they were going to close all restaurants and bars other, you know
[19:34.500 --> 19:36.660]  Other than to allow for takeout and pickup
[19:37.220 --> 19:38.980]  um
[19:38.980 --> 19:41.860]  Uh and delivery I guess takeout and pickup are the same thing
[19:42.740 --> 19:43.780]  but uh
[19:43.780 --> 19:48.740]  You know delivery and takeout and then los angeles followed shortly thereafter
[19:49.220 --> 19:53.540]  Almost probably just accounting for the time difference made that decision at the right time
[19:53.540 --> 20:00.740]  The governor of ohio, which neighbors pennsylvania to the west announced that the whole state was going to close all restaurants and bars for the same
[20:00.740 --> 20:02.740]  You know same policy other than takeout
[20:03.460 --> 20:05.060]  and delivery
[20:05.060 --> 20:11.620]  And then this morning the mayor of philadelphia jim kenny said that uh, he still wanted he said he encouraged
[20:11.620 --> 20:16.820]  He was still encouraging people to go to restaurants and to tip generously. The staffs are hurting
[20:17.540 --> 20:21.700]  We can't really afford to close all these restaurants. It's you know, it's it's
[20:21.700 --> 20:23.380]  it's
[20:23.380 --> 20:24.740]  it
[20:24.740 --> 20:28.740]  His top priority was obviously the economic impact of closing restaurants
[20:28.820 --> 20:35.700]  Which again I and I know people who work, you know, I I have my friend lee owns a a bar here in philadelphia
[20:35.780 --> 20:37.380]  hop singh laundromat
[20:37.380 --> 20:38.820]  um
[20:38.820 --> 20:41.060]  I have friends in the restaurant industry
[20:41.220 --> 20:46.500]  I have a good friend matt who works up in new york in the industry and has been filling me in there
[20:47.060 --> 20:49.860]  I mean, it's just devastating restaurants. It's really devastating
[20:49.860 --> 20:55.620]  It's you know, they're just not equipped for this, you know financially to to like pay staff
[20:56.500 --> 20:58.020]  um
[20:58.020 --> 21:00.900]  I mean literally famously I mean in america at least, you know
[21:00.980 --> 21:05.540]  Waiters, most of the people a lot of the people who work in restaurants don't even have a salary that could still be paid
[21:05.540 --> 21:07.540]  They make all their money from tips
[21:07.540 --> 21:11.780]  uh doesn't work if you know the place is half empty and
[21:12.660 --> 21:16.180]  You know, there was this half measure where they were going to say well everybody you can be open
[21:16.180 --> 21:18.660]  but you have to be half capacity and it's like
[21:18.660 --> 21:22.740]  Number one that didn't seem like a great idea. It's not an airborne illness, right?
[21:22.820 --> 21:26.660]  So this is one of the things that I haven't understood about some of these responses where they're like
[21:26.660 --> 21:31.220]  Well every every if everybody is a table is six feet apart then it's okay
[21:31.380 --> 21:36.980]  But it's not me, you know measles is airborne which when you think about it, it's terrifying right that you could just walk by somebody
[21:36.980 --> 21:42.260]  You know back before there was a measles vaccine somebody had measles and you just walk by them on the sidewalk and you get measles
[21:42.260 --> 21:44.900]  You get the measles. Did you see the thread?
[21:44.900 --> 21:50.100]  um, so so you posted a link to one don shaffner thread and this is this guy who's a
[21:50.980 --> 21:53.540]  expert expert on food safety yeah, and
[21:54.100 --> 21:58.500]  You posted your post about hand washing which was really great and the idea that it does, you know
[21:58.500 --> 22:03.700]  Really warm water or cold water. It's the soap that matters right which was really good
[22:04.340 --> 22:09.460]  And then he he said hand sanitizer also is very effective against this kind of virus
[22:09.460 --> 22:12.180]  So you should also use hand sanitizer. It's super powerful
[22:12.180 --> 22:15.300]  He had a new thread today because lex friedman our buddy
[22:16.020 --> 22:18.020]  I've never heard never heard
[22:18.980 --> 22:23.300]  Um said I basically i'm worried about um, takeout being contaminated
[22:23.860 --> 22:28.180]  Oh, well, that's interesting. How does this work and don basically says and again?
[22:28.180 --> 22:33.540]  He's he's an expert although not the only expert and people have conflicting opinions, but he basically said
[22:34.180 --> 22:40.180]  It's unlikely because this is a respiratory illness which means that people are sneezing and coughing
[22:40.180 --> 22:47.080]  They're sneezing and coughing and then you breathe it in and that's how you get infected if somebody sneezed
[22:47.620 --> 22:52.500]  On your food while they were making it that would be gross and they should go home if they're sick
[22:53.220 --> 22:54.020]  but
[22:54.020 --> 23:00.340]  It's going to be in your mouth and then you swallow it and then it's uh got your stomach has a low ph
[23:00.340 --> 23:02.340]  So it's going to inactivate the virus
[23:02.500 --> 23:05.460]  um, if it gets to your intestine he says
[23:05.460 --> 23:09.700]  Um, it's a respiratory vi virus. It's not really designed to invade that way
[23:09.940 --> 23:12.420]  So it probably wouldn't work
[23:12.580 --> 23:18.340]  So basically what he says is i'm not really worried about getting the virus from food whether it's hot or cold doesn't really matter
[23:18.900 --> 23:19.860]  it's
[23:19.860 --> 23:22.420]  the because as far as we know this is about
[23:23.060 --> 23:29.300]  People coughing or sneezing and then you um either breathing that in or the the whole hand washing thing
[23:29.300 --> 23:33.380]  You know touching something that's got it on it and then bringing that up and putting it on your eye or in your mouth
[23:33.380 --> 23:39.620]  Or or something like that. So it's it's not yeah, so the vectors matter, which is why everybody keeps saying, you know
[23:40.980 --> 23:48.180]  Wash your hands don't touch your face because and keeps keep your distance and that that can do a lot to mitigate this
[23:48.420 --> 23:50.420]  and and something like
[23:50.580 --> 23:56.020]  Uh having the restaurants convert to takeout your your big risk. There is the person who's handing you the food
[23:56.660 --> 23:58.660]  And you're their biggest risk, too
[23:59.460 --> 24:01.460]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely
[24:01.460 --> 24:06.820]  Um, and I had to run a few errands today. I mean, it's at the point like today where
[24:08.900 --> 24:16.500]  I I was sort of crossing i's and dotting t's on like what do we really have to do if we want to
[24:17.540 --> 24:18.580]  Get it
[24:18.580 --> 24:23.460]  You know if we get locked in here for two weeks and again who knows this could get worse in two weeks
[24:23.460 --> 24:25.380]  We might I might you know three weeks from now
[24:25.380 --> 24:29.220]  I might think I might laugh at the thought that two weeks was a worst case scenario
[24:29.220 --> 24:31.540]  But I don't see any practical way
[24:32.260 --> 24:35.300]  That I could buy, you know, I can't get I can't buy a month of food
[24:35.300 --> 24:37.860]  I mean, I guess in theory I could but uh, you know
[24:38.500 --> 24:42.820]  I'm not prepared for that. But one of the things was I needed to go to the bank. I needed to
[24:43.700 --> 24:47.540]  uh move some money from the business to personal so we could pay some bills and and
[24:48.260 --> 24:51.860]  You know for the time going forward till the end of the month, etc
[24:51.860 --> 24:56.660]  I was just effusively. I I I you know, like I just thanked the guy at the bank
[24:56.660 --> 25:00.180]  I was like, I just want to say thanks. I'm glad you're here. You know, I appreciate you
[25:01.540 --> 25:07.060]  And I don't know I I felt a little Larry Davidist. I was like, I just want you to know when I came in
[25:07.060 --> 25:09.060]  I really sanitized the hell out of my hands
[25:10.820 --> 25:12.820]  He's like, thanks
[25:13.460 --> 25:16.420]  Those guys I don't know what's going on with their hands because they are there
[25:16.420 --> 25:19.300]  They're squirting a little Purell on their hands between everything
[25:19.300 --> 25:25.620]  They're squirting a little Purell on their hands between every single customer and it's like man that is that's that's the hard stuff
[25:28.180 --> 25:29.780]  Uh
[25:29.780 --> 25:34.580]  Yeah here it's you know, but it's been weird, you know, like so our mayor said that and that was this morning
[25:34.660 --> 25:37.940]  It was a new story this morning. Our mayor said
[25:38.420 --> 25:39.620]  uh
[25:39.620 --> 25:44.900]  You know keep going to bars and restaurants. We'll keep you know, we'll have lower seating but tip them generously
[25:44.900 --> 25:49.300]  we want to keep them open and um, like this is not the right I it's a
[25:49.780 --> 25:52.340]  Your heart's in the right place in terms of their businesses
[25:52.500 --> 25:55.540]  but this is the this is not leadership and my thought was
[25:56.100 --> 26:00.260]  Maybe he's waiting for the governor of pennsylvania to say the whole state
[26:00.820 --> 26:05.780]  Restaurants have to be shut down and then he as the mayor doesn't look like the bad guy who shut restaurants down
[26:05.940 --> 26:08.820]  I don't know but it's like, you know profiles and courage here
[26:09.780 --> 26:13.700]  And then literally by like 12 30 like new just after noon
[26:13.700 --> 26:18.100]  Uh new story comes out and in the philadelphia inquirer had the exact same photo of him
[26:18.980 --> 26:24.520]  Literally just the same photo and it's you know, the philadelphia is shutting down all non-essential
[26:25.380 --> 26:30.980]  Businesses, you know, it's pretty much grocery stores drugstores banks and doctors, you know, that's it
[26:31.140 --> 26:34.420]  It's it's like a lot of politicians don't want to be the one to go first
[26:34.580 --> 26:35.940]  Because they don't want to be out of step
[26:35.940 --> 26:39.700]  But once everybody's stepping in the same direction, it makes it a lot easier for all of them
[26:39.700 --> 26:45.780]  Yeah, and I thought so too especially for philly which i'm not going to say it's not a suburb of new york
[26:45.860 --> 26:48.340]  But we're in new york's orbit
[26:49.860 --> 26:51.220]  and
[26:51.220 --> 26:53.140]  Having new york go first
[26:53.780 --> 27:00.340]  last night really would have given a lot of cover to me if I were the mayor of philadelphia I would have
[27:00.660 --> 27:04.980]  I I would have done it last night after new york did it even if I was on the fence once new york went
[27:04.980 --> 27:06.980]  I would have done it. Um
[27:06.980 --> 27:14.020]  Um, it just it it it really just seems that like the worst case scenario that we're trying to avoid just is
[27:14.260 --> 27:19.880]  Is that dire and every single person who knows what the hell they're talking about without exception?
[27:20.660 --> 27:27.940]  Is saying playing for time is absolutely essential act, you know both on both ends in other words acting as soon as we do
[27:28.420 --> 27:30.420]  As soon as we can collectively
[27:31.220 --> 27:33.860]  Whether we know all the facts are right or not
[27:33.860 --> 27:38.580]  versus you know, and then trying to stretch this out the whole uh, what's it called, uh,
[27:39.460 --> 27:45.540]  Uh flatten the curve flatten the curve. Yeah, right, but you've got to act this you have to act as quick quickly as possible
[27:45.940 --> 27:51.140]  I saw a good video from some doctor in in the uk with the uk in particular seems to be really
[27:51.700 --> 27:58.660]  Particular as bad as the us national response has been boy the uk really seems to have had their collective heads up their asses on this
[27:59.380 --> 28:00.980]  um
[28:00.980 --> 28:02.980]  but there was a you know a
[28:02.980 --> 28:07.380]  uh world health health organization doctor in the uk who was saying
[28:08.020 --> 28:09.460]  that
[28:09.460 --> 28:13.060]  This is not the time to be worried about whether you're right or wrong
[28:13.540 --> 28:14.340]  It don't be you know
[28:14.340 --> 28:19.620]  Everybody's afraid everybody wants to be perfect and make the right decision and nobody wants to make a mistake by enacting
[28:21.120 --> 28:25.560]  Draconian measures and then to find out that they weren't necessary
[28:26.420 --> 28:27.460]  um
[28:27.460 --> 28:33.380]  You have to yeah, you know, the most single most important thing is to act as as strong as you can as quickly as you can
[28:34.020 --> 28:38.340]  Um, because if you wait until you're certain that you need to it's far too late
[28:39.300 --> 28:43.460]  You know, we've seen that we've seen that here in the us with this situation with the testing kits
[28:45.220 --> 28:46.500]  Right
[28:46.500 --> 28:52.180]  Uh, my parents, uh, literally are still they they should be right now on a cruise
[28:53.860 --> 28:55.700]  But they're not
[28:55.700 --> 29:01.780]  But it wasn't because of the coronavirus per se my mom actually came down with an unrelated bug
[29:01.860 --> 29:05.300]  She does not have coronavirus, but but you know became ill
[29:05.940 --> 29:07.860]  a few days before
[29:07.860 --> 29:13.940]  and they knew you know, the coronavirus thing was already floating about and they took it as an opportunity to hey, let's uh,
[29:15.220 --> 29:20.100]  You know what? We didn't feel good about this. Anyway, let's cancel, uh and canceled and uh,
[29:20.100 --> 29:24.660]  I can only imagine that that's no fun at all right now. I would I would imagine
[29:25.300 --> 29:28.740]  I I can't even imagine the claustrophobia of being on a cruise ship right now
[29:28.740 --> 29:33.700]  Even if you're on a cruise ship that you know as seemingly most of the ones that are still at sea
[29:33.700 --> 29:36.740]  I mean, I know all of the major cruise lines have stopped new voyages
[29:36.740 --> 29:42.820]  But this was like a 10-day cruise or something. They were supposed to be on because they were retired and can go on very long cruises
[29:44.260 --> 29:47.300]  I would imagine the ones that are at sea even with no reported cases
[29:47.300 --> 29:50.340]  It must feel like you're on this giant floating prison
[29:52.020 --> 29:53.460]  I yeah
[29:53.460 --> 30:00.340]  Or worse than a prison. I don't know, you know, I don't know a petri dish giant floating petri dish with small beds
[30:00.900 --> 30:02.900]  I mean i've done some cruises
[30:02.900 --> 30:04.900]  It sort of feels like a floating prison already
[30:06.340 --> 30:12.740]  Yeah, I I have too and I feel the same way you definitely I feel a little cooped up. Uh, I
[30:12.740 --> 30:17.940]  Uh, one thing I can think of and i'm playing it back in my mind is uh, and I was you know
[30:17.940 --> 30:22.420]  Talking to my parents before they made that decision and I didn't at the time. I didn't tell them
[30:22.420 --> 30:29.380]  Hey, definitely don't go because it it's changed so it seems ridiculous in hindsight, but you know, like nine days ago. It didn't seem
[30:30.420 --> 30:32.420]  out of the question to go
[30:33.700 --> 30:34.420]  um
[30:34.420 --> 30:38.500]  but the thing that I thought about from my times on a cruise ship is that it is
[30:38.500 --> 30:44.820]  Impossible to get and do anything without touching things, you know, you're you're
[30:45.540 --> 30:52.100]  Always opening doors. There's all doors everywhere right like to get inside to get outside to go here to go there
[30:52.740 --> 30:53.700]  like
[30:53.700 --> 30:54.740]  it
[30:54.740 --> 31:00.500]  It it just seems like a nightmare to me and everything is you know, you know hallways are so narrow
[31:02.500 --> 31:03.700]  I don't know
[31:03.700 --> 31:09.540]  Yeah, my heart's out to everybody who's on stuck on a cruise ship. Uh
[31:11.540 --> 31:15.540]  Otherwise, you know, I don't know what to say. It's it's bizarre. I
[31:16.420 --> 31:23.540]  You know, but then you know, there are parts of life that seem normal, you know, like I said the de bruno brothers, uh,
[31:24.420 --> 31:27.620]  You know food market here in downtown, philadelphia
[31:28.260 --> 31:31.460]  You know, I think it's a good idea to go to the food market
[31:31.460 --> 31:33.460]  here in downtown philadelphia
[31:33.780 --> 31:37.300]  Has been mostly normal that you know, i'm not going every day
[31:37.380 --> 31:41.300]  i'm trying to you know, get as much as I can and and bring it home and uh,
[31:42.260 --> 31:44.260]  But you know, it's not crazy
[31:44.580 --> 31:48.020]  Uh it it you know, and if you weren't really closely paying attention
[31:48.100 --> 31:53.940]  You wouldn't really notice, you know that every single employee not just the ones at the deli are wearing plastic gloves
[31:54.820 --> 31:59.380]  Um, their their shelves are well stocked with pasta and all of the you know
[31:59.380 --> 32:05.060]  They even still have bread a lot of the bread's gone. But uh, they still have a wide assortment of bread, uh,
[32:05.940 --> 32:10.820]  wider than a lot of the photos i'm seeing from other places my wife went to trader joe's though on
[32:11.700 --> 32:15.300]  Friday or thursday morning while jonas was still going to school. She dropped him off
[32:15.780 --> 32:18.520]  Had the car went to the trader joe's here in center city, philadelphia
[32:19.380 --> 32:20.900]  um
[32:20.900 --> 32:23.780]  And she felt like she might have made a mistake when she pulled in now
[32:23.780 --> 32:26.660]  It's it, you know for those of you who don't live in a major city
[32:26.660 --> 32:30.420]  It's a trader joe's is a weird supermarket. It's a lot of fun
[32:31.300 --> 32:37.060]  People and the parking lots are always bad park and the parking lots are always bad on a normal
[32:38.100 --> 32:40.020]  On a normal thursday at 8 a.m
[32:40.020 --> 32:42.020]  It is not a good parking lot
[32:42.020 --> 32:46.980]  But it's the sort of parking lot where you don't just pull in off the street and you're in the parking lot
[32:46.980 --> 32:52.020]  You're pulling off the street and you're more or less in like a driveway to get to the parking lot
[32:52.020 --> 32:57.300]  And she pulled in and realized this is going to be a mistake. It was a half an hour to get
[32:58.020 --> 33:03.940]  From the street to the parking lot, but she couldn't back up because people had gotten behind her and it's you know
[33:03.940 --> 33:08.500]  One way to get in another way to get out so you can't just make a u-turn or something
[33:09.060 --> 33:14.020]  So she more or less had to wait the half hour to get to the parking lot once she did that why not go
[33:14.660 --> 33:16.660]  She gets to the front door
[33:16.660 --> 33:23.220]  There's a line to get in because they were filled to the fire code capacity and there's an employee there saying, you know
[33:23.220 --> 33:28.340]  That the way they're managing the fire code is every 20 who leave they'll leave let 20 come in
[33:30.100 --> 33:34.900]  And she said that you know, she's she didn't count but she figured she was probably like 25th, you know
[33:34.900 --> 33:39.620]  But she wasn't like in the next batch. She was like at least one batch behind
[33:39.620 --> 33:46.900]  Um, and so she waited a while and maybe like 10 minutes or something and then a woman came out a customer and and just
[33:47.460 --> 33:49.460]  empty-handed and said
[33:49.780 --> 33:51.780]  You know unless you have two hours
[33:52.500 --> 33:56.340]  You know announced to everybody waiting in line unless you have at least two hours of time
[33:56.980 --> 34:00.500]  You should just leave because I was in there 45 minutes
[34:01.620 --> 34:07.620]  The line to get to the checkout snaked through every single up and down every aisle of Trader Joe's
[34:07.620 --> 34:09.940]  up and down every aisle of Trader Joe's
[34:10.900 --> 34:16.820]  And she said I was I was only about one third of the way through and she said the only way to shop is to get
[34:16.820 --> 34:21.460]  A cart get in the line empty carted and as you snake
[34:22.420 --> 34:24.420]  through every aisle of the market
[34:24.900 --> 34:26.340]  Do your shopping?
[34:26.340 --> 34:29.540]  While you're in line, she said it's the only way to get she said because
[34:30.260 --> 34:32.500]  There's no other way because the line is solid
[34:32.660 --> 34:36.980]  You can't really you know shop and you know any other story is the line at that point, right?
[34:36.980 --> 34:41.780]  the store is the line and she said she was in there 45 minutes and was she said I was only about a third of
[34:41.780 --> 34:46.580]  The way through maybe a half at the best and my wife had to had to ghost had to be somewhere at 10
[34:46.820 --> 34:51.060]  So it was she knew she wouldn't make it. So she just abandoned ship and came home
[34:52.020 --> 34:57.460]  It's crazy. I mean, yeah, and and what everything i've read says that the supply chain is fine that that
[34:58.100 --> 34:59.940]  People people are rushing out
[35:00.100 --> 35:00.420]  Yeah
[35:00.420 --> 35:04.020]  Because they're afraid and I think the truth is you want to have some
[35:04.020 --> 35:07.540]  Semblance of control over your life and that's a thing that you can control is, you know
[35:07.540 --> 35:12.020]  Kind of nesting instinct like people who are about to have a baby have whereas i'm going to take care of this
[35:12.020 --> 35:14.660]  And i'm going to get it done. I'm going to stock up and all of that and and
[35:15.300 --> 35:18.980]  You you know, this is a thing that we can't control and that we you can't even see it
[35:19.140 --> 35:22.820]  And so I I understand the the human nature behind it
[35:22.820 --> 35:28.660]  But also everything i've read says that the supply chain is doing okay, and there aren't going to be food shortages
[35:28.660 --> 35:33.460]  And you don't need to do what people have been doing where they're you know, buying all the toilet paper and all of that
[35:33.460 --> 35:38.980]  At the same time. I do think it's true that everybody would probably be wise to minimize the number of trips
[35:38.980 --> 35:40.100]  They take to the store
[35:40.100 --> 35:46.820]  so like if you used to we always talk about my wife will often go to trader joe's and whole foods and safeway and
[35:47.380 --> 35:49.220]  you know costco and
[35:49.220 --> 35:56.340]  Get different things at different places and what we're trying to do is have you know, make our list be big and then go
[35:56.980 --> 35:58.340]  Ideally at an off hour
[35:58.340 --> 36:00.340]  Although it sounds like there basically aren't any
[36:00.340 --> 36:06.340]  And do one kind of trip and then and then that's it for a while just to reduce the amount of exposure
[36:06.420 --> 36:10.580]  But there's only so much you can do but I get the I get the human nature part of it of just wanting to
[36:11.060 --> 36:16.180]  wanting to control it something in an uncontrollable situation, but it's also kind of ridiculous to
[36:16.900 --> 36:21.860]  Have that kind of experience at the trader joe's trader joe's is not made for that. No, it's just not no it really isn't. Um
[36:22.980 --> 36:29.780]  Uh, and you know again my hat's off to all of those people who are doing their jobs showing up
[36:29.780 --> 36:33.700]  I mean, man, absolutely, you know anybody who's who's working at a grocery store
[36:34.420 --> 36:37.220]  uh or who is in the supply chain, uh, like
[36:38.180 --> 36:44.900]  Parcel drivers and and letter carriers and everybody who's in the distribution thing anybody who does deliveries of any kind
[36:44.980 --> 36:48.100]  like this is how the rest of us are gonna be able to
[36:48.740 --> 36:49.620]  You know
[36:49.620 --> 36:54.580]  Ride this out is that there are people out there who are moving everything around and getting it where it needs to go
[36:54.820 --> 36:56.580]  We have a great ups guy, you know
[36:56.580 --> 36:59.780]  You know, I know marco's talked about this where he lives everybody has a different, you know
[36:59.860 --> 37:02.900]  Some people have a bad ups service and a great fedex guy
[37:03.460 --> 37:07.060]  We have a pretty we have pretty good fedex, but we have a great ups guy vince
[37:07.220 --> 37:13.380]  I mean, we love the vince is the best honest to god. I should write like a letter to the ceo of ups about vince
[37:13.540 --> 37:20.020]  He's the best ups guy shows up today. Amy was like vince. I'm so happy to see you i'd hug you but you know
[37:20.740 --> 37:22.740]  And he's like you you got it. Amy
[37:22.740 --> 37:26.820]  So virtual hugs all around
[37:26.820 --> 37:32.740]  But uh, man, I can't even imagine the stress honestly i'd be so stressed if uh, if I were working like a
[37:33.280 --> 37:39.140]  Register, you know and just you know people one after another after you know, think about it. And like I said, they were
[37:39.780 --> 37:41.620]  fire capacity
[37:41.620 --> 37:46.340]  All day, probably. Yeah, and that's too many people in an enclosed space on top of it. So, yeah, right. Yeah
[37:46.420 --> 37:47.700]  Yeah, I don't know what they're going to do
[37:47.700 --> 37:53.540]  You know now that like the cdc is saying that they're recommending no more than 50 people in a group. Does that count?
[37:53.620 --> 37:56.820]  like is a supermarket count is 50 people and
[37:57.380 --> 38:04.660]  I I I don't know how they're going to do that because like a trader joe's is very different square footage than like a suburban
[38:05.300 --> 38:09.700]  Safeway or you know, whatever your your brand, you know, piggly wiggly wherever you live
[38:09.700 --> 38:17.140]  Yeah, you know the new, you know, the modern supermarkets in in suburban united states are enormous, you know
[38:18.100 --> 38:23.300]  50 people in a modern walmart is empty right? It's a ghost town. I mean i'm not saying
[38:23.860 --> 38:27.620]  I'm, you know, we all have to be smart and we have to listen to the advice of the experts but
[38:28.260 --> 38:34.260]  I'm, not quite sure what they mean by 50 people at a time because I think it really makes a big difference whether it's 50 people
[38:34.260 --> 38:39.460]  In a trader joe's versus 50 people in a walmart for sure
[38:40.500 --> 38:44.420]  Anyway, let me take a break here. Thank our first sponsor great sponsor linode

[40:56.420 --> 41:02.820]  If you're really more like me and just sort of a punter, uh, really it just comes out of the box ready to go with a modern
[41:03.380 --> 41:05.380]  linux up to the date
[41:05.460 --> 41:09.380]  Really easy to use if you're familiar with the command line at all. They also have a great

[41:28.980 --> 41:30.980]  careers to find out more
[41:30.980 --> 41:35.460]  My thanks to linode for continuing to uh support the show. Yeah
[41:35.460 --> 41:38.980]  Uh, let me think. I think last time I was here. We were talking about your uh,
[41:39.620 --> 41:45.780]  All of our various movable type problems involving moving to new servers and things like that and it's uh, linode's great though
[41:45.780 --> 41:50.420]  That's where mine is too. I've got an old server there on an old version and a new server there
[41:50.420 --> 41:53.540]  That's going to run the new version and it's a whole it's a whole thing
[41:55.700 --> 41:58.740]  Boy that feels like a long time ago yesterday feels like a long time ago
[41:58.900 --> 42:03.780]  I I know that all of our jokes about how every week was a month. It's like every hour is a month
[42:03.780 --> 42:05.780]  Now, yeah, uh
[42:06.660 --> 42:11.140]  I guess before we move on I got to get this out of the way because it's actually a couple of weeks old a couple
[42:11.140 --> 42:18.980]  Episodes old i've got i've got follow-up. This feels ancient. This feels like something from like the 1980s at this point
[42:20.500 --> 42:24.020]  I don't even remember what the hell episode we were talking about this on
[42:25.060 --> 42:26.260]  but uh
[42:26.260 --> 42:28.260]  In the context of sherlocking
[42:29.060 --> 42:32.420]  Do you I don't know if you I don't know. Oh, yeah, what was I talking about?
[42:32.420 --> 42:36.900]  Oh, yeah, what was I talking about? What was yeah, so the idea here is that is that um,
[42:38.020 --> 42:40.580]  sherlock like that that watson
[42:41.220 --> 42:45.940]  Uh was this app and then sherlock came out and the truth is there was a sherlock before right?
[42:46.340 --> 42:52.260]  And then watson the idea was that watson was going to amplify apple sherlock. But what happened is that in sherlock three?
[42:52.900 --> 42:54.500]  Not to I mean i'm reading your notes here
[42:54.500 --> 42:58.180]  But that that was that big moment where like because the whole idea of sherlock three was that there were these templates
[42:58.180 --> 43:04.740]  It was all these smart templates and that was what watson was was smart templated search and things like that to make it more than just
[43:04.740 --> 43:09.700]  Sort of a a basic find utility right and so it boomerang back around where it was like
[43:10.180 --> 43:14.100]  Watts sherlock begat watson and watson was like sherlock only better
[43:14.340 --> 43:20.340]  I think that the sherlocking happened when sherlock got suddenly got all the features that watson had. Yeah, and and
[43:20.660 --> 43:23.540]  uh, I think that might have been the episode with molts but uh,
[43:23.540 --> 43:30.180]  But I I had I had forgotten that in the context of our community verbifying sherlock to mean
[43:30.660 --> 43:32.580]  When apple comes in with a built-in
[43:33.460 --> 43:35.460]  feature or utility
[43:35.620 --> 43:41.300]  That obviates all or even just significantly part of a third-party utility
[43:41.300 --> 43:46.900]  We call it sherlocking because of this thing with sherlock and the third-party app watson the thing I had forgotten
[43:47.380 --> 43:51.860]  Was yet exactly what you said apple had a thing called sherlock first, but it was really just sort of
[43:51.860 --> 43:53.060]  like
[43:53.060 --> 43:56.020]  Like what we now call spotlight sort of it was just like yeah
[43:56.020 --> 43:59.380]  I mean it was basically like a find command for the internet
[43:59.380 --> 44:04.820]  I think but but where it would do a an internet search or or a search on your mac
[44:05.060 --> 44:08.100]  But it didn't have all of the like template
[44:08.340 --> 44:12.100]  Search templates where you could search for a very specific thing and get a specific result back
[44:12.180 --> 44:17.060]  Yeah, and that was watson did and have them come back in a very structured form
[44:17.060 --> 44:24.820]  Like if you're searching for weather it came back in like a widget in the window that looked like weather results
[44:24.900 --> 44:28.100]  And if you search for a movie and the imdv page would come back
[44:28.340 --> 44:30.420]  Right dad and it would have you could write them in
[44:30.980 --> 44:35.460]  Watson and then later in sherlock you could actually write a search query where you basically said if they input this
[44:35.540 --> 44:40.820]  Here's the url and then here's how you parse the result and display it and it was a whole thing. It was very clever
[44:41.380 --> 44:42.420]  and
[44:42.420 --> 44:42.980]  You know
[44:42.980 --> 44:47.940]  We could argue about whether it was also my memory at the time is that it was also fairly clear that that was the direction
[44:48.020 --> 44:55.140]  Apple's product was going in right and just because watson existed didn't mean that suddenly apple couldn't take their product in the direction
[44:55.780 --> 44:58.500]  It needed to go in but that was that's the origin of it
[44:58.740 --> 45:04.980]  Yeah, but it's funny that I didn't remember the sherlock one and two part of it even though it it would have been
[45:05.540 --> 45:08.980]  It it makes no sense for the first product to be named watson
[45:08.980 --> 45:13.860]  Yeah, also what a burn that would be if they uh, if apple steals your product and also
[45:14.660 --> 45:18.420]  Names it something that just references your product right even worse
[45:18.900 --> 45:19.860]  It did
[45:19.860 --> 45:23.700]  It did set off a sort of when I was talking about it live on the show
[45:23.780 --> 45:28.600]  I I definitely was like I don't think i'm getting this right because that doesn't make sense. That seems way too gratuitous
[45:29.140 --> 45:31.620]  Um, yeah cheap shot, right?
[45:32.340 --> 45:33.700]  uh
[45:33.700 --> 45:36.980]  although I guess the closest they ever got to that was with the
[45:36.980 --> 45:38.160]  the
[45:38.160 --> 45:39.440]  confabulator
[45:39.440 --> 45:40.880]  thing with
[45:40.880 --> 45:42.880]  What was apple's thing?
[45:42.880 --> 45:47.720]  Recall, it's dash dashboard, right? Right, but the thing that was sort of the naming was similar
[45:47.880 --> 45:53.960]  So for those who don't remember back in around the same time, you know pre iphone, you know
[45:54.040 --> 45:58.360]  Probably so probably circa like 2004. There was a third-party utility called confabulator
[45:59.400 --> 46:02.920]  With a k here i'll put it in the show notes. I'll i'll write this down here
[46:02.920 --> 46:09.560]  Uh, there's a uh, there's a nice daring fireball, uh post about this. Yeah, there's definitely a nice df post about it. Uh,
[46:11.800 --> 46:17.800]  Actually, i'll probably have to link to it because probably anything related to the actual confabulator is 404 by now, uh,
[46:18.840 --> 46:25.020]  Other than a handful, you know mac world still around tidbits is still around but geez just about anything else is probably 404
[46:25.480 --> 46:29.560]  but anyway third-party utility arlo rose and uh
[46:29.560 --> 46:33.240]  I forget who else was was behind it was sort of a two-person thing
[46:33.240 --> 46:37.160]  It was kind of really neat really neat idea where you would use xml
[46:37.720 --> 46:43.720]  To specify what they called gadgets and then a gadget would be like a little window like a little uh,
[46:44.600 --> 46:46.440]  just a little uh
[46:46.440 --> 46:53.000]  You know, if you know if you remember dashboard widgets in in apple, you know confabulator gadgets were sort of the same thing
[46:53.000 --> 46:59.960]  I think that what this old the old df post actually says a confabulator had widgets and apple's documentation called them gadgets
[47:00.280 --> 47:04.200]  But then when they shipped them they called them widgets, so it's like they just completely took it over
[47:04.440 --> 47:07.720]  They just completely took the name. Yeah. Well widgets is a better name
[47:07.720 --> 47:14.200]  Anyway, which is no surprise that the first one used it rather than because they're not gadgets. They're widgets. There's definitely a difference
[47:14.760 --> 47:19.800]  Anyway, both of them were neat ideas dashboard was built on html css and javascript
[47:19.800 --> 47:24.920]  I guess confabulators scripting language was javascript, but the specification was
[47:26.120 --> 47:28.120]  A custom xml thing
[47:28.760 --> 47:35.400]  And now that I think about it. This is my my let's let's modernize this with the sherlock and watson and
[47:35.880 --> 47:39.640]  The gadgets and the widgets and the confabulators and the dashboards
[47:40.520 --> 47:46.920]  All of that was all desktop stuff because there was no iphone yet. We were a couple of years away from the iphone
[47:46.920 --> 47:51.740]  Uh, but it all sort of in hindsight pre-saged
[47:52.280 --> 47:53.240]  the
[47:53.240 --> 47:55.240]  current world where
[47:55.960 --> 47:57.960]  on
[47:57.640 --> 48:02.760]  Phones and I think to a great extent too definitely ipads on mobile
[48:04.520 --> 48:10.520]  Applications native applications dominate usage in the mobile using the web
[48:11.080 --> 48:13.080]  in in a web browser
[48:13.080 --> 48:20.120]  Web browser, uh is a minority of I just saw some statistic somebody pointed to a talk from a google engineer
[48:20.840 --> 48:22.840]  who uh
[48:22.920 --> 48:25.240]  Who claimed and this was I get a talk, you know
[48:25.240 --> 48:32.600]  But uh that that according to google statistics something like only eleven percent of time spent on mobile devices
[48:32.920 --> 48:34.920]  Is in a is on the web
[48:36.600 --> 48:37.640]  I don't know. I mean for me
[48:37.640 --> 48:41.640]  It's definitely higher because I sit there and read stuff on the web all the time
[48:41.640 --> 48:47.240]  but yeah, but I believe it, you know, and and I think it's you know, I don't know how google measures it because
[48:47.880 --> 48:49.880]  a ton of my time
[48:50.840 --> 48:53.960]  On the web on my phone is in tweetbot
[48:54.920 --> 48:59.000]  So i'm on the web, but I don't know because i'm in tweetbot whether that
[48:59.780 --> 49:04.440]  Registers with google is i'm on the web or you know, and if i'm not on a google website
[49:04.440 --> 49:09.560]  How is google measuring it? I guess that's whole bunch of sites have google analytics hooked up. I don't know
[49:09.560 --> 49:14.600]  But it all rings true though. If you just think about how you used, you know, where you I use apps all the you know
[49:14.600 --> 49:18.200]  way more than I use the web and that seemed to me the whole point of
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.680]  sherlock and watson and confabulator and
[49:24.040 --> 49:25.800]  Dashboard was
[49:25.800 --> 49:33.800]  Hey native stuff is cool and and it from an interface perspective is better and more convenient than always having to go to this
[49:34.040 --> 49:38.520]  Browser app and opening I guess we did. I don't even know if we had tabs back then
[49:38.520 --> 49:42.680]  It was just dozens and dozens of windows with one web page in them
[49:44.680 --> 49:46.680]  Yeah, I think it also um
[49:47.640 --> 49:53.480]  Suggested the sweet solution that we got when the iphone came out right of being able to sort of save
[49:53.960 --> 49:58.520]  Web pages and instead of having apps there were sort of like web apps and it was very much the same kind of like well
[49:58.760 --> 50:03.240]  A web page with javascript is kind of like an app and that was in the water obviously because here in
[50:03.240 --> 50:10.140]  2004 the same that was what dashboard and confabulator were is use web technologies to build stuff and now now we have
[50:10.620 --> 50:13.340]  the equivalent of that for things, uh, like, uh,
[50:13.740 --> 50:18.140]  You know my slack app that I use every day is built with web technologies, right?
[50:18.140 --> 50:23.340]  It's not it's not a native app and it has it has benefits to the developer largely and
[50:23.820 --> 50:27.260]  a cost to the user largely, but um, it is
[50:28.140 --> 50:31.100]  it it's the same kind of push and pull and like the the beauty of
[50:31.100 --> 50:35.100]  The dashboard stuff back in the day was all you needed to know was
[50:35.880 --> 50:42.620]  Javascript you didn't need to know everything that goes into building a native app and that that was they were trying to find a new
[50:43.420 --> 50:49.180]  A new place for people who wanted to build stuff on the platform to go who had this background in web technology
[50:49.180 --> 50:55.020]  But didn't have it in in building apps. Um, but the iphone changed that really fast the app store
[50:55.020 --> 51:02.380]  Yeah, and yeah, I definitely think that there was that sentiment of hey we can do it we can give so the web is such a
[51:05.980 --> 51:12.540]  It's such a tremendous step forward in terms of its openness fundamental openness and that it's
[51:13.100 --> 51:17.660]  Inherently cross-platform and it it was largely a boon to apple
[51:18.220 --> 51:19.260]  because
[51:19.260 --> 51:25.340]  prior to the growth of the web in the explosion of the web in the 90s when that was literally it
[51:25.820 --> 51:30.780]  the explosion of the web coincided with apple's resurgence after they acquired next
[51:31.420 --> 51:35.900]  And they go hand in hand because part of the reason apple was suffering so much in the mid 90s
[51:36.300 --> 51:42.700]  Was that windows had become so dominant that everything that was all software that was being not all software, but
[51:43.260 --> 51:45.660]  You know like when napster first came out that was a huge
[51:45.660 --> 51:50.860]  Thing napster was a windows app and the mac apps at first were like
[51:51.740 --> 51:56.780]  Remember it was like maxter. I mean there were it was you know, like a sort of semi-open protocol but
[51:57.340 --> 52:00.940]  New stuff happened and it was windows apps and inside
[52:02.140 --> 52:04.140]  uh, you know like
[52:04.620 --> 52:11.100]  Big corporations when they made in-house applications. They they were making windows apps and so, you know
[52:11.100 --> 52:17.660]  There was no way to sort of have a hey this department can use max and that department can use windows
[52:17.660 --> 52:24.140]  it was like everybody had to use windows because some of the tools that the company had were windows only and when the web came about
[52:24.860 --> 52:26.220]  and
[52:26.220 --> 52:31.100]  You know it was possible to make web apps for everything all of a sudden you could use a mac and you could use windows
[52:31.100 --> 52:34.220]  And you could log on to your intranet remember that word
[52:35.900 --> 52:37.580]  But it was
[52:37.580 --> 52:43.020]  You know it instead of windows being dominant because it was 95 of all computing devices
[52:43.020 --> 52:49.840]  The web was dominant because it was literally a hundred percent of computing devices. Right like you it it was unimaginable
[52:50.540 --> 52:55.740]  At one point to think that there would ever be this platform that would have greater market share than windows
[52:56.300 --> 53:00.300]  But it was because it was like a meta platform that could run anywhere, right? Right?
[53:00.300 --> 53:05.340]  But at the other hand the downside to it was man, you know the user experience just like
[53:05.580 --> 53:10.140]  Clicking on buttons and filling in text forms and the text editing and you know, just
[53:11.100 --> 53:16.380]  Everything was like just this huge crude step backwards because everything was sort of a crude
[53:18.780 --> 53:23.740]  Lowest common denominator experience right it's you know, the the the the the the
[53:23.740 --> 53:30.540]  And the web's come a long way in some ways in terms of how polished you can make the experience but the gist of it
[53:30.540 --> 53:33.580]  I think you know the sentiment behind things like confabulator and
[53:34.460 --> 53:40.860]  Sherlock and watson etc. Was that man we could make this so much better and you know like with confabulator in particular
[53:43.420 --> 53:47.660]  Most of their widgets were very small and they were very small
[53:47.660 --> 53:52.940]  You know, like just a little like index card size if not smaller, right? Like like when you open
[53:53.660 --> 53:58.700]  The calculator app or pcalc from our friend james thompson, right you get it on a mac
[53:58.700 --> 54:04.140]  You don't get it doesn't take up your full screen because it's just a calculator. It opens a little window
[54:04.140 --> 54:06.140]  That's the size of a calculator
[54:06.140 --> 54:11.820]  Right, which is exactly very useful and especially with if you have like a desktop module
[54:11.820 --> 54:18.540]  Where you can really, you know, arrange your windows just so you can have a little window off to the side for a thing
[54:18.540 --> 54:24.460]  That only needs a little window like why in the world if you just want to have the with the weather open
[54:24.460 --> 54:31.180]  Would you need to open a new web browser window, which is going to default to the size of you know?
[54:31.820 --> 54:37.100]  Full height of your screen and you know the size of a piece of paper when all you need is a little window
[54:37.100 --> 54:42.860]  You know full height of your screen and you know the size of a piece of paper when all you need is the temperature
[54:42.860 --> 54:45.420]  You know, you just need a little a little widget, right?
[54:47.980 --> 54:51.660]  So I thought that was I thought one of the mistakes apple made with dashboard was
[54:52.380 --> 54:55.420]  By putting them all on the one page. Remember you used to have to go off to the left
[54:55.900 --> 54:57.900]  It was like well, what's the point right?
[54:58.220 --> 55:00.380]  Like if I just want to have a little weather thing
[55:00.380 --> 55:04.620]  Why can't I have the little weather thing right there with all my other windows in my main space?
[55:04.620 --> 55:09.660]  I'm i'm still i'd love to know why apple did it that way because I thought it was a terrible mistake
[55:09.660 --> 55:11.660]  I almost wonder whether they did it that way
[55:12.220 --> 55:19.580]  As like a courtesy to confabulator because doing it the other way was the way confabulator did it where the gadgets were interspersed with your regular windows
[55:20.460 --> 55:26.300]  I don't know. Yeah, there was a workaround where you could like pick up a dashboard widget and then hit the hotkey to close dashboard
[55:26.300 --> 55:30.700]  And then it would stay out of the dashboard layer so they could run outside
[55:30.700 --> 55:34.220]  But I think you know, maybe apple just didn't want to mix and match but you're right
[55:34.220 --> 55:38.940]  The whole appeal was that there were these little things right and then they all lived on their own full screen layer. Yeah
[55:39.740 --> 55:42.560]  Well, who knew we were going to spend time on confabulator?
[55:44.620 --> 55:51.900]  That was that was the interface of the confabulator confabulator widgets was also um, they were often very bizarre. It really reminded me of
[55:52.860 --> 55:55.500]  The era of mp3 players with custom skins
[55:55.500 --> 56:00.460]  It like like, you know panics player and and sound jam and all that that had these super weird skins
[56:00.460 --> 56:07.180]  And it was it was an era that era was the time where people like created like photoshop files with weird
[56:07.880 --> 56:10.780]  interfaces and thought they would try them out and then
[56:11.340 --> 56:15.980]  I I think in the end they were fun, but not necessarily functional
[56:16.940 --> 56:22.700]  Yeah, what was panics was audio on so it was audio on and sound jam and uh,
[56:22.700 --> 56:29.180]  And what was the big one a win amp was winning one on windows, right and it was always to me it that whole era
[56:29.420 --> 56:34.460]  Well, I guess again, I guess it predated during fireball, uh, because that was all
[56:35.180 --> 56:37.020]  itunes came out
[56:37.020 --> 56:43.520]  In 2000 or 2001 2000 itunes came out. Yeah, right and because the ipod came out in 2001
[56:44.380 --> 56:47.980]  I don't have an encyclopedic knowledge of dates
[56:47.980 --> 56:55.260]  But I you know famously remember that because the ipod announcement was postponed and was low-key because it was
[56:55.980 --> 56:58.620]  After in in the aftermath of 9 11. Yep
[57:00.300 --> 57:01.260]  Which
[57:01.260 --> 57:06.460]  I have to say has been on my mind a lot lately because I keep thinking that what we're going through right now the only
[57:06.780 --> 57:08.780]  comparison I can think of
[57:08.780 --> 57:15.980]  In terms of just the general uncertainty that every single person is experiencing right now is only comparable to 9 11
[57:15.980 --> 57:20.860]  Is only comparable to 9 11 and I know it's different in a whole bunch of ways
[57:21.740 --> 57:27.260]  But in just in terms of general uncertainty boy, I remember that but anyway that was all before daring fireball
[57:27.260 --> 57:28.940]  But the thing I remember
[57:28.940 --> 57:32.460]  And boy, I wish I had been writing during fireball so I could point to it was
[57:33.020 --> 57:41.500]  how emblematic of the difference between windows and mac the difference in the quality of those weird custom uis was between
[57:42.540 --> 57:44.540]  sound jam and audio on on the mac
[57:44.540 --> 57:46.540]  versus winamp
[57:47.020 --> 57:53.100]  And I forget which one it was if it was sound jam or audio on that eventually supported winamps format
[57:53.260 --> 57:58.300]  So that you I think sound jam let you use winamp skins eventually
[57:59.100 --> 58:01.500]  yeah, and that sort of made sense because
[58:02.140 --> 58:07.980]  Even though sound jam is the one that apple acquired and turned into itunes
[58:09.180 --> 58:11.660]  and still lives on today is the
[58:11.660 --> 58:14.380]  In two ways, I guess as both the uh
[58:16.460 --> 58:20.220]  The music app on catalina and the
[58:20.940 --> 58:23.580]  tv app on catalina are both
[58:24.300 --> 58:26.060]  sort of forks
[58:26.060 --> 58:28.060]  of itunes which was
[58:28.140 --> 58:31.500]  Apple's rebranded single skinned, of course
[58:33.420 --> 58:37.100]  Version of sound jam right but I that you know
[58:37.100 --> 58:44.540]  that you know, no surprise and both were technically excellent and I guess I should it's time to put a link into cable sasser's
[58:44.620 --> 58:45.980]  write-up of
[58:45.980 --> 58:48.460]  When apple reached out to panic to think about you know
[58:48.620 --> 58:53.740]  They were obviously apple had two choices of things to buy and they were both very good options
[58:54.300 --> 58:57.340]  And you know apple considered buying panic just to get
[58:57.980 --> 59:02.540]  Audion, but I at my recollection was that while both were technically excellent
[59:02.540 --> 59:07.840]  Especially given the constraints of the classic mac os it was absolutely insane to have background
[59:08.360 --> 59:11.840]  mp3 players and in like invisible transparent windows
[59:12.480 --> 59:17.760]  Stuff like that. Like there was no support in the os for transparent windows and somehow they made it work. Um
[59:19.600 --> 59:20.960]  Uh, yeah, and they just did a um
[59:20.960 --> 59:25.600]  They just did a blog post about finding all the faces of audion of all those custom things
[59:26.160 --> 59:29.680]  As a part of the because panic has a podcast now, right? I've been on it
[59:29.680 --> 59:34.400]  And yeah, and krista mergen is is producing it and they did an episode about audion
[59:34.400 --> 59:41.200]  And then they did a thing about how they had to dig up all of their old skins and find a way to make them
[59:42.000 --> 59:49.040]  Display properly which is really fascinating to that that kind of spelunking through 20 year old stuff
[59:50.160 --> 59:52.160]  All right, we'll link to that. It's noted
[59:54.080 --> 59:57.120]  But anyway, I my hunch my gut feeling and I think
[59:57.120 --> 01:00:00.640]  Most people would agree was that the the skins for audion were
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.360]  slightly more
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.640]  Exquisitely designed than the ones for sound jam
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:13.780]  Um, and you know, no surprise coming from panic whose forte is exquisitely pixel-perfect
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:20.720]  Chef's kiss that is the state of the art in user interface design right now
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:24.000]  Sort of work and then the winamp stuff was like
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.040]  I don't know. It was pretty much like the vegas strip
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.440]  Like the bad end of it
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.680]  Flashy for sure not necessarily what you would call beautiful
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.840]  Yeah
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.600]  What else I got more follow-up, uh
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:49.440]  Look at you. Yeah one more. Uh, we were talking about this story
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:56.640]  We were talking about this story, uh, the german report about apple perhaps
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:01.300]  Do you know and file this under a non-sarcastic finally?
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:08.560]  Allowing third-party default apps on ios by which we mean let's say you use spark
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.120]  uh or you use
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:19.280]  Gmail the gmail app as your main email client you could though the idea would be you could say this is my main email client
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.680]  And so if you click a mail to link in any app
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:23.600]  uh
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:31.040]  It would open gmail or spark or whatever it is that you've said. This is my main email client as opposed to apple mail
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.200]  and you could say
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:38.320]  Uh chrome is my default web browser. And so you open a web link anywhere that opens in your browser
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.320]  It would open in chrome. It's so forth
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.720]  um
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:49.200]  the angle on here that I need to follow up was with regard to um
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.700]  I I said something the effect of apple doesn't really have a financial
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.200]  angle here, you know that whatever there
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:01.760]  There are many reasons and I defended it in some ways, you know that it's not
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:08.800]  As much of a no-brainer as some people would think especially people who like us who use third-party apps and are really, you know
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:15.840]  Write about them and enjoy hearing about them and know the developers of them and are enthusiastic about you know
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:17.920]  new third-party apps, um
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:22.820]  It's easy to get caught up as an enthusiast and think this is just totally frustrating
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:27.600]  Bs that apple doesn't allow you to set these things as your default for these handlers
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:33.440]  But it's you know, it requires nuance to think about why apple might not have done it. It's not quite just
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.440]  In it's definitely not in difference and I don't think it's spite
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:41.920]  But the one thing I said was something to the effect of that. They don't really have a financial interest in it
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:47.760]  It's not like when you use apple mail instead of the gmail app that apple profits from that
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:55.440]  The thing that I overlooked and I knew about this i've known about this for you know years ever since it started
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.920]  Is that the safari?
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:00.480]  versus other browsers thing is
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.480]  There's a lot of money involved
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:10.560]  Right, and the thing I got hung up on was that even with third-party browsers you have to use webkit
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:17.220]  As the rendering engine and so in some extent even if you're using chrome or you're using firefox
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:22.160]  If you're using it on ios, you're using this fari rendering engine webkit under the hood
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.800]  the difference is
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:32.000]  and it is a lot of money is that google is at pays apple a ton of money to
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  of money to
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:39.920]  Be the default search engine in safari. So when you go up to the location bar and you type
[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:49.680]  Coronavirus symptoms and hit return and it goes to google by default and returns search engines
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:55.440]  The most recent information I found
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.880]  I don't where did you update this? I don't know if you know
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:04.160]  I know this is this is your your link the 12 billion estimated the 12 billion dollar
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:07.060]  Check written from google to apple in 2019
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.040]  Yeah, so and you know
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:14.560]  I would presume given the way things have gone that it's only gone up since then and nobody really knows
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:21.360]  I don't believe this has been confirmed. What are the what's the sourcing on this will reportedly pay pay this according to business insider. It's
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:26.880]  Comes via goldman sachs analyst rod hall rod hall is actually a very good analyst
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:31.840]  uh, yeah, he gets on the apple, um analyst calls, so obviously they they don't think he's a
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:37.680]  A rogue element or anything, but I mean if you think about it, it's like it's like having amazon affiliate fees or something
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:42.240]  Like there's a search engine affiliate relationship. Yeah, and apple gets paid
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:46.640]  By google for all of those search referrals and i'm sure if if
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:50.480]  They were duck duck go searches duck duck go would pay
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:55.760]  Something too except they wouldn't and they'd go out of business or whatever. I'm sure microsoft would pay with bing, right?
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:58.640]  It's it's a they're sending business. Google's way
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.840]  and and they get paid for it, which is
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:05.840]  there's an argument to be made that maybe apple should use something like duck duck go or apple should
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:09.760]  Buy duck duck go and have it as this neutral search engine that isn't tracking people
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:13.040]  um, but that would be not just a
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:18.640]  Nice move for consumers that they would be turning their back on billions of dollars a year if they did that, right?
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:22.640]  So if we take rod hall's number at it, you know and again
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:28.480]  You might imagine that this is that negotiated at the very highest levels of apple
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:31.040]  And google I would assume
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:37.200]  At eq and tim cook are directly involved. I don't even know you know it
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:44.320]  I don't know who the equivalents would be at at google but you know 12 billion dollars is
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:48.560]  Even by apple standards is a lot of money
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:53.840]  A lot of money, um, and it's you know, I I I
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:56.640]  I don't forget it, but I think I often
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:01.840]  I don't I don't know that I bring it up enough and it is it does sort of
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.400]  It it is
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:11.040]  It's worth even more than an asterisk. It is a don't forget like raise your hand
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:14.880]  Don't forget about like when tim cook talks about apple having different
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:18.260]  Different uh priorities in terms of privacy
[01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:23.220]  and he has even mentioned google by name as a company that has
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:27.700]  By apples from apple's perspective lesser
[01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:32.820]  Places a lesser priority on privacy of customers
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:35.700]  um
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:37.860]  That apple isn't
[01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:39.860]  You know when they're taking 12
[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:46.740]  To or plus billion dollars a year to keep google as the default search engine in safari on all their platforms. They're
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:50.500]  They're they're getting a pretty nice piece of that pie
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:52.100]  Yeah
[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:53.860]  And they're you know
[01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:57.940]  I I don't think they're absolved in the least from all of the privacy implications of that
[01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:02.420]  I mean if you're taking the money then you're you're on the hook for all of all of that
[01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:07.700]  And yeah, even even if you're you know, limiting your disclosure of what you know
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:11.800]  And personalize information on all those things which they have rolled into safari
[01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:18.040]  You know in the end you're still sending them to a google page. Google knows your ip address unless you're using a vpn
[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:24.260]  They can build a profile. They are going to show you ads all of those things are still a part of that experience
[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:30.340]  You know, you could argue that google is still also the best search engine experience and right that that's part of the argument
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:33.620]  I've been using duck duck go on my mac for a while and you know what?
[01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:38.820]  It's okay, but there are moments where I have to just go to google to find something because duck duck
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:45.140]  Though just can't quite do it. Google is slicker. It's it's very it's a good product, but it's also it's google
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:47.300]  We all know what that means. Yeah
[01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:48.580]  uh
[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:50.580]  It's definitely, you know a complicated
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:55.540]  Decision but you know and part of the reason I i've been using duck duck go for years now
[01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:59.620]  Enough as my default for enough years and for most times
[01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:02.740]  it
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:07.060]  You i'm not doing it despite myself. It's not like i'm you know
[01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:11.700]  Living in a shack out in the woods, you know cutting my own, you know
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:15.060]  Buttering my own animals that i've caught in a trap
[01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:22.820]  You know duck duck go is a very good search engine and if google didn't exist and duck duck go were the best search engine
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:24.260]  We had today
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:27.380]  We would still all be raving when we really are honest about it
[01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:33.460]  But what a marvel, you know, one of the great marvels of the current of the modern world this search engine
[01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:37.380]  Is that we can type these things and get the results, but there are times there are definitely
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:44.100]  More times than the vice versa by far that you might type x y and z and expect to get a certain result
[01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:49.300]  And duck duck go doesn't have it and then you do the same search in google and there it is at the top of the results
[01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:55.220]  One of the things that makes that easy though is for the most most of the searches duck duck
[01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:57.380]  Go is just fine and you get exactly what you want
[01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:59.860]  And if it's not and you suspect google's going to do better
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:04.500]  You can just go right back up to your search terms and type g x just add the term
[01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:08.980]  g exclamation mark as a duck duck go shortcut for
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:12.340]  Redirect me to google and do the exact same search
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:17.460]  And they redirect you to google in a way that I think sort of helps prevent tracking
[01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:22.740]  they I don't know i'm not sure how I don't know how you could possibly keep google from tracking you but
[01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:24.420]  uh
[01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:29.140]  It's not that bad. I don't know if anybody's ever thought about doing it. I I would encourage you to try but
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:31.140]  uh
[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:33.220]  end of follow up basically, uh
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:39.300]  You know, guess what, uh when you use chrome as your browser
[01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:46.100]  On ios and you do a search in the search field. Google is paying apple for that
[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:51.460]  And so, you know, that's that's the obvious implication is if they allowed
[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:57.540]  Users to you know, and this is a very cynical take but it's you know, it's obviously on apple's mind
[01:09:57.540 --> 01:10:02.900]  It's real money. But if they were to allow third-party browsers to be set at the as the default
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:11.380]  presumably that that might increase the number of users who you spend more time in chrome or
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:13.780]  firefox or
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:17.700]  You know, there's dozens of other really good web browsers for iphone and ipad
[01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:21.540]  The more people use them and being able to set them as the default would
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:24.260]  You would think would only increase that
[01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:30.420]  It would decrease apple's leverage over google for this annual negotiation on
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:32.980]  Keeping the it as the default search engine
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:36.180]  right
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:39.300]  Wouldn't you love that was I always think about that whenever this comes up
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:44.740]  I always think of all the things I would love to be a fly on the wall for would be the those
[01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:47.640]  Negotiations in particular seem
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:56.600]  Just like man that it would be like I wouldn't you just wouldn't that be like a fantastic apple tv show right?
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:03.240]  Like they should they should have a crew and tape them now and then just show it five years, you know
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:07.320]  Five years from now so that it's you know, you know, keep it. I don't know
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:12.200]  It would be so great because both sides have tremendous leverage, right? Like
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:15.960]  both sides have tremendous leverage right like apple's got the
[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:20.920]  tremendous market share of iphone and ipad
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:24.600]  It's uh, also it's not just the sheer number of users
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:30.840]  It is the demographics of you know, their their average household income compared to other mobile users
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:33.800]  It's their engagement that I you know, ios users
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:39.640]  Often are shown to be more engaged with their devices than android users and just the sheer
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.120]  number of
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:45.960]  uh, just the sheer amount of collective attention that people pay to
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:50.680]  uh, their mobile devices and how many times they do web searches
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.360]  uh
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:56.920]  That's apple's side and then google's side is well, what are you going to do? You're really going to go to bing?
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.160]  you know
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.080]  Are you really going to buy duck duck go?
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:04.840]  I mean because I I mean, I don't know if they'd have to buy duck duck go to make it the default
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.920]  I I don't know though that
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:10.120]  You know and you know and just think about it from a user's perspective
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:13.480]  Like if you what update your phone to ios 14
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:18.600]  And then you go to do a web search and it's sending you to duck duck go which you've never heard of
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:23.240]  Again, I love duck duck go. I encourage you, you know people who listen to this show
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:29.960]  To try it. I don't think my mom would understand what the hell is going on if her phone
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:38.040]  Was up automatically updated the next version of ios and searching the web sent her there. I don't know that she's ever heard of it, right?
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:41.400]  Right. So I don't think she's ever heard of bing to be honest. I
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.600]  So I I feel like
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:51.640]  Apple would probably make a lot more if bing were
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.400]  stronger
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:56.360]  In branding and in in terms of public consciousness, right?
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:04.520]  Sure, because then you know, maybe they would ping pong year to year like okay now Microsoft's gonna offer us 20 billion
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:09.160]  But they're not interchangeable I feel like that is still the you know, it's still the crown jewel of google's
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:17.720]  Arsenal is the quality of the web search. Although I do think that web search. Do you think this do you think google web search is getting worse?
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:22.040]  I don't use it as much as I used to because i've been using
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.680]  I've been using duck duck go a lot more on the desktop
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:31.240]  But I don't know. I mean I still go back to it and think that it's better than duck duck go
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:36.040]  But I don't know. I mean I still go back to it and think that it's better than duck duck go at finding pages, but
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:38.920]  I don't know. I'm not that's just purely
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:42.040]  Anecdotal it maybe it's related to my stuff
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:46.200]  But the one thing I find that's very difficult to find period duck duck go
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:53.560]  Or google is older stuff and by older i'm gonna say roughly anything more than five years ago
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.040]  but like if
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:01.320]  You know, i'm sure that this can you know confabulate or daring fireball is still going to show my thing
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:04.280]  uh, but when I look for stuff like, you know,
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.400]  I don't know stories about um
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.520]  Just recently. Here's an example. I I
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:15.960]  Jean-louis gasset, uh and forgive me if if I butchered
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:21.880]  I think you nailed it. Well, it's as close as I can get to to a french accent
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:25.800]  uh at a post that I linked to a couple days ago about
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:29.560]  Just yeah, just spitballing on the idea of it. You know, what's
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:35.400]  What would an what are the issues related to apple moving the mac to arm?
[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:37.640]  CPUs
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:43.320]  And I wanted to look up stuff related to the power pc to intel transition from
[01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:46.020]  2005 and 6
[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:51.940]  And boy was a lot of that hard to find or just unfindable like it just seems like
[01:14:53.140 --> 01:15:00.020]  And you know, it makes sense that most of what people search for is recent stuff. And so the algorithms, you know
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:02.580]  Tend to gear towards recent stuff
[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:04.340]  uh
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:11.860]  But it just seems to me anecdotally that search engines have gotten worse at finding stuff from 10 years ago than they used to be
[01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:14.660]  But maybe that's just me. I don't know
[01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:20.500]  Uh, let me take a break. Thank our next sponsor. Oh, it's our good friends
[01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:24.340]  And you're not going to be surprised. It's our good friends at squarespace

[01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:59.140]  And all of the features you might need on a website

[01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:02.660]  Oh coronavirus and apple
[01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:07.780]  Let's get it over with I mean there's a lot to talk about here and there is an awful lot since
[01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:11.700]  The last time I did a show which was only like two weeks ago
[01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:13.540]  um
[01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:19.460]  We went from one from me and federico talking about I think I gave the odds then at 50 50 that we would have
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:24.100]  wwdc, but maybe i'm giving myself too much credit and I thought it was like
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:28.740]  A one in three chance that wwdc was not going to happen
[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:37.720]  And of course as we now know wwdc is as we know it as an in-person five thousand attendee
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:44.120]  The con congregation of the entire apple community is not going to happen
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:50.120]  And as we record today on monday, that is the most obvious statement in the world
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:53.340]  Two weeks ago. It wasn't it seemed a little outlandish
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:57.880]  And even when apple made the announcement last week
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:01.400]  They were still slightly ahead of the curve, right?
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:05.320]  It didn't you know, it was I don't think anybody was surprised by that point
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:08.040]  But it it seemed like the writing was on the wall
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:13.560]  Yeah, yeah, it was I feel like we progressed very quickly from
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:16.360]  It might not happen to
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:19.880]  it it probably won't happen to
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:26.280]  It's they've certainly decided it's not going to happen, but they haven't announced it yet, which um
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:29.080]  The nice thing about that is by the time they made their announcement
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:33.400]  I feel like everybody had already like it was a fork on conclusion by the time they said it
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:35.720]  yeah, we had already passed the
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:37.880]  passed to the point of
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:39.880]  acceptance in the stages of
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:41.560]  grief
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:42.920]  um
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:48.280]  I kind of feel I have no inside information on this whatsoever, but I kind of feel
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:52.520]  I one thing I am certain of and this isn't from inside information
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:55.960]  It's just knowing the way apple works is that they were on top of this
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:59.160]  for a long time
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:02.120]  and their public silence on it is a
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:06.300]  It's a reflection of that's that's how apple is about everything apple isn't
[01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:08.940]  doesn't doesn't
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:13.020]  You know apple measures a hundred times and cuts once, you know, they they were
[01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:16.460]  monitoring this their silence on it and their
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:22.380]  The fact that they didn't announce anything officially until last week wasn't because they weren't paying attention or were taking it lightly
[01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:24.460]  It was that they you know
[01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:26.620]  They take their time
[01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:31.260]  Um, I can't help but feel you know, and the weird thing about this is that
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:39.340]  WWDC I don't know if there are i'm not aware of any other conferences of similar size that I would know about
[01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:42.300]  that are
[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:46.860]  Always every year annually announced with so little
[01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:52.540]  Time between the announcement of the dates and
[01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:59.980]  The selling of tickets, you know are now a lot, you know lotteries, you know to get for attendees to sign up to to go
[01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:02.700]  and the actual
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:08.300]  Conference most conferences are announced at least a year in advance so that
[01:21:09.260 --> 01:21:13.180]  You know macworld is a great example. You'd you'd be leaving macworld expo
[01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:18.640]  And the signs at the door would say, you know next year January
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:22.400]  4th to 10th. Yeah macworld next year, you know
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:30.800]  And most conferences are like that, you know WWDC has always been unusual in terms of having you know getting announced
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.440]  You know mid-march to mid-april
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:39.120]  I think mid-april is about the latest they've ever done it, you know, even though it's I think they've gone to late-april
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:45.120]  But not much more than that, but you know other than like one exception from like 2006
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:51.440]  I believe when it was in august. It's pretty much been like clockwork
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:22:01.760]  You know, I don't think i've been wrong in 10 years at guessing which week in june was going to be WWDC week
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:07.600]  This week this year's is a little bit it's always june it always starts on a monday
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:12.560]  This year's a little harder to predict because june 1st is a monday
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.800]  Because june 1st is a monday
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:20.480]  But I think that you know the use by the usual schedule the start would have been june 8th
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:25.120]  You know and if june was pushed back a little just a little bit
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:28.640]  one more day, uh, definitely would have been that that
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:33.360]  That second the monday starting the second week of june. Um
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:39.920]  But so all of these other conferences that have been cancelled and every
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:45.520]  all it's funny because not every can't conference has been cancelled, uh, I saw that there was like a
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:47.440]  construction
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:50.240]  big 130 10 130 000 attendee
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:58.820]  Conference in las vegas last week that wasn't cancelled, but they got nowhere near 130 000 attendees
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.520]  Yeah
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.920]  They have you know, they they were you know
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:11.040]  Cancelled is absolutely the right verb for what happened because they were scheduled and then they were cancelled. Well wwc
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:14.480]  Wasn't cancelled because it was never announced, right?
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:16.480]  right
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:18.080]  um
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:25.200]  So what they did do was they they made an announcement last week that wwc will have a all new online format
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:27.840]  uh
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:30.000]  But they didn't give it didn't even give dates
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.760]  which reading between the lines to me says
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:37.120]  They weren't quite ready to announce it
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:41.600]  Whether they would have all you know, whether it would have been announced by now
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:45.040]  In the alternate universe where this coronavirus didn't even exist
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:47.040]  I don't know
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:53.440]  But I feel like as they made their plans for how they do this online only, you know
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:58.960]  Or or online perhaps plus a small media event for the keynote
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:01.440]  Although I think even that is looking less and less likely
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:04.080]  even now in mid-march
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:11.520]  I feel like they they were they were looking at the news and thinking we can't wait anymore, you know
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:17.680]  Like if if they if if you and I were talking right now on march 16th and apple still hadn't said anything
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:19.680]  It would seem absurd
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:20.960]  right, it's
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:24.080]  So I feel like their hand was pressed to at least come out and say
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:29.120]  WWDC is going to be in june. It's going to be online only in an all-new format
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:33.920]  Uh, we have lots of stuff. We're excited to tell you and we'll tell you more soon
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:39.840]  But I feel like the fact that it doesn't even have a date for the keynote to me says
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:46.740]  That they kind of felt like the news even even with their silence the news was getting ahead of them on this coronavirus
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:52.240]  I think you're right and I think they decided that it was that they didn't need to make
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:54.320]  An announcement with specifics just yet
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:57.680]  But they needed to at least be clear that that that this was the case that it was
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.400]  They had reached the point where they really needed to just say yeah, of course
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:03.840]  We're not going to do this, but we are going to do something online and we'll let you know
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:07.840]  I was struck by the fact that not only did they not give dates, but they say beginning in june
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:11.440]  And it's sort of like starting in june whatever it is and it's like, okay
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:15.600]  Well, so we've got a month which is june. It could be the first week, but it could be the last week
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:17.600]  right and then starting in june I
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:20.400]  I immediately thought and when does it end?
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:28.240]  Like they could completely reconceive this thing where there's a big kickoff sometime in june and then there are new sessions that roll out
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:34.560]  Across the whole summer even not necessarily all there on day one or even in over the course of a week
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:38.480]  I'd think that you know, that would be the closest analog and it might be what they prefer to do
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:41.680]  But they're not really committing to that. They could stretch this out
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:44.400]  and and have
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:50.560]  And and have wwdc be this thing that happens over the course of you know
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:56.240]  Eight weeks if they wanted to or or all summer the one thing that really matters timing
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:59.040]  not timing wise but
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:03.680]  You know as a mark your calendars. This is an event is the keynote
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:09.440]  The the public keynote the thing where they make the announcements they would have made on monday morning
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.080]  which is meant for
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:14.340]  everybody from developers
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:17.060]  to the mass market
[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:24.900]  Not even technical media, you know and apple's wwdc's get coverage on the front page of newspapers and you know
[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:29.860]  And again, I realize being on the front page of a printed newspaper is nowhere even close to what it used to be
[01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:34.580]  but even if you talk about newspapers like the new york times in the washington post and
[01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:41.640]  The san francisco chronicle and and you know, whatever else there's above above, you know first screen of nytimes.com
[01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:48.340]  It's the same idea is that you want to get that that kickoff event is the one that everybody covers and right and has broad
[01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:51.380]  Appeal and everything else is for the developers basically, right?
[01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:56.340]  But I can't help but feel that's part of the calculus of not even announcing the date for that yet
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:02.580]  Is of you know, not no, I mean this whole coronavirus thing is so up in the air
[01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:08.420]  I mean, and maybe there's an optimistic scenario where we go through a bad
[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:11.140]  april and uh
[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:19.300]  But then we start getting on the downslope in may and maybe it's not it's obviously never going to happen
[01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:23.460]  That they're going to have five thousand people in a giant convention room for a keynote
[01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:30.580]  but it may be you know, maybe the idea is that a a media event at the steve jobs theater with
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:34.900]  A couple of hundred. I don't know. I mean at this point it sounds
[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:39.300]  Outland right? I I do think that maybe they're holding out hope that um
[01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:44.420]  things will have calmed down to the point where they might be able to have a small crowd in the steve jobs theater for
[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:49.220]  That keynote instead of it just being like a like steven colbert and john oliver were last week
[01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:52.340]  Where it's sort of they're shouting into a void and there's an empty theater, right?
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:58.980]  I do also think one part of the hedge here has to be when do you you can't do wwdc unless you've got
[01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:00.500]  Unless you've got
[01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:04.740]  Um your new operating systems ready to go, you know the scope of them, you know, what's new
[01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:06.580]  You've got stuff ready to show to developers
[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:11.700]  You've got downloads ready to put up and that's the other part of this one of the stories we've seen in the last few days
[01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:14.020]  because this is moving fast is
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:16.100]  developers
[01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:20.980]  Internal to apple but because of the security restrictions on apple stuff
[01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:28.100]  It either unable or it's very difficult to work at home on top secret apple stuff, which is kind of a no-brainer
[01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:30.660]  but at the same time like if you're trying to get
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:36.900]  new versions of mac os and ios and watch os and tv os and ipad os all
[01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:41.300]  Ready in a developer version to drop the first week of june
[01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:46.500]  And suddenly you're trying to get them all to work from home or they can't all be in at the same time or whatever
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:47.940]  It is
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:52.100]  It really calls into question the ability to to to stay on schedule
[01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:55.380]  And that's the other part of this is like what if they don't have a beta?
[01:28:55.380 --> 01:29:02.500]  What if they don't feel like they they might not be able to announce until the end of june if they slip three or four weeks
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:06.020]  Right, um, all of that is up in the air right like that. This may not go
[01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:11.460]  It's not just the gathering issue. It's also the like who's working on the software issue
[01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:17.540]  Yeah, and there's there's actually so there's two sides to that. So one maybe inside apple the
[01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:20.260]  because of this work from home being a
[01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:25.860]  Serious disruption to the way apple works. I mean more than any company i'm aware of in the tech sphere
[01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:29.700]  And this is no surprise to anybody who's listening to this show
[01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:37.060]  Apple has a culture of being on site face to face with the people you work with apple straight straight from steve jobs
[01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:42.900]  That was he he was absolutely a believer that everybody had to be in the same place at the same time, right?
[01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:45.460]  And that doesn't mean they're all in the same building. They're way too big now
[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:51.300]  They they're pretty much the entire city of cupertino now is office buildings owned by apple
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:58.980]  um, I mean really I mean it's it if for those of us drive drive down there sometime and you will there is an
[01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:03.940]  apple logo on almost every corner like including across the street which really
[01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:09.300]  Just didn't used to be the case and buildings, you know, there were buildings that's like, ah that looks like, you know
[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:13.800]  There was like this great expansion in the late 80s and early 90s
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:19.880]  and you know in that era when steve jobs was in exile and you can kind of tell because
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:23.160]  Like the architecture of the buildings. Yeah, just very
[01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:29.000]  Not too. I can spot I can spot a late 80s early 90s apple building a mile away
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:33.240]  We had one in san diego not too far from where I went to college and I had the little apple logo on it
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:38.440]  And you know 1991 or whatever and all of them look like that and there are a bunch of those in cupertino for sure
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:40.680]  But then there's some weird ones now too
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:45.240]  Like ones that are like there's no way that's an apple building and then there's the you drive by and there's the sign
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:46.760]  And there's an apple logo
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:51.400]  They've leased all the space there is to lease in cupertino and then built a giant campus
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:53.720]  Right and across the street from the giant campus
[01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:57.160]  I don't know if people know this one of the funny things about it is apple already had buildings
[01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:02.120]  On that street where the visitors center is, um, most of the buildings across the street
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:05.560]  Uh that are south of the visitors center toward the freeway
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:10.840]  Those are all apple buildings that have been there a while and and then if you go under the freeway there
[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:17.240]  There's the old mall that they want to redevelop and part of the things they want to redevelop that into is more office space
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:20.520]  that apple wants so they're they are
[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:26.600]  Basically, the motto is you know, if you're in california you're in cupertino and if you if you aren't, you know
[01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:29.320]  Your your organization is all in one building
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:34.120]  And if you need to talk to somebody else's organization you go, you know, go you go to a different building
[01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:37.020]  But everybody is together. That's why james thompson famously
[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:39.960]  was given the ultimatum that he had to move from ireland to
[01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:43.960]  Cupertino if he wanted to keep working on the mac os 10 doc because steve didn't want
[01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:47.660]  The developer of the doc to be in ireland. He wanted him to be in california
[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:53.640]  Yeah, and it's you know, it's not to say everybody's in cupertino either. I know apple is a growing footprint in seattle
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:32:01.640]  Sure, they've I don't know if they're still there. I remember like the the iworks team used to be in pittsburgh pittsburgh. Yeah, right, but
[01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:05.240]  The iworks team was in pittsburgh, right? It wasn't like yeah
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:08.520]  Oh, yeah, you know you can you if you'd like to come work on iworks
[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:11.160]  You could work in the pittsburgh office or you could work in seattle
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:14.360]  You come to cupertino if you want to work on cloud you go to seattle
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:15.400]  If you want to work on tv
[01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:19.480]  You go to la if you want to work on iwork you go to pittsburgh and if you want to work on mac os
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:25.080]  You are going to be seated in in apple park. Basically. It is a face-to-face collaborative culture
[01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:30.280]  So now what for better now, what do they do? Right? Well, so there's two levels to it
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:33.880]  the first level and I have to admit the the
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:38.680]  I think you're talking about the wall street journal story from the other day about the the problems, you know
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:42.440]  I'll I have it written down. So i'll remember to link it. Um
[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:52.520]  I've thought about just the cultural part of it that they're just not they don't have tools for remote collaboration within the within a very close-knit team
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:54.760]  um
[01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:56.440]  they
[01:32:56.440 --> 01:33:00.680]  they just don't have the culture of it and um
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:03.320]  that what the journal story brought up though is that
[01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:07.480]  There are just policies and rules about it that you keep for example
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:13.240]  You can't bring hardware out of the building without of these, you know, famously, you know
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:17.480]  We know these stories from the iphone. I mean the iphone was really super serious like in a vault but
[01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:19.080]  um
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:19.960]  You know
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:21.960]  Hardware doesn't leave certain
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:23.480]  for sure
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:25.080]  locked closed
[01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:26.840]  regulated doors
[01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:29.480]  but what if what you're working on requires, you know,
[01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:31.080]  you're
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:36.520]  You're a software engineer and you need to build and run but you need to build and run on the hardware
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:40.920]  But if you can't take the hardware out how you know, there's no way to do that
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:43.000]  and
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  think about things like
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:47.800]  You know
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:49.800]  I'm going to make up some numbers here, but whether
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:51.480]  um
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:34:00.120]  you know a certain animation for a transition should be 300 milliseconds or 500 milliseconds and you build both and
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:05.880]  You look at them. Well, how the hell do you do that over remote video conferencing, right?
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:08.860]  How does a team that is sweating the details?
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:13.400]  on how many milliseconds an animated transition should be
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:18.600]  Do it when they're used to doing it on the actual prototype or you know
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:24.440]  Even if it's not a prototype hardware, even if it's just an animation for a new thing that's going to run on the iphone 11
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:28.680]  But you're there together as a team looking at so the hardware isn't secret
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:31.880]  It's just an eye for just testing on the iphone 11, which is already out
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:37.080]  But the software is secret and the animation in terms of what it looks and feels like
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:41.160]  Is right there in your hand in front of your eyes
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:47.240]  And now you're supposed to do it from home and the person demoing it to you is doing it over a video conference
[01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:54.540]  Well, how in that that's running, you know, 60 hertz or something like that 60 frames per second or or less. It's impossible
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:58.200]  It's absolutely impossible to make that sort of judgment call
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:04.360]  Over a teleconferencing link no matter how good your bandwidth is, you know to your home
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:12.300]  So I don't think it's I don't think it is speculative at all to to suggest that this is going to be disruptive
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:15.160]  to the development of
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:17.320]  Everything apple has been planning
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:22.920]  Uh for the entire year software wise and it's not to say that they couldn't do it
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:26.680]  But it is to say that they I think have not built up any
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:30.120]  I don't know, but i'm going to guess they've built up very little
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:35.720]  That allows them to do it in these cases where you got to be there because why would they?
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:40.280]  I mean other than to do disaster contingency planning which living in california
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:46.200]  You should probably do anyway and there were questions about like with the fires if the air quality wasn't going to be good enough
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:51.000]  Like there are all of these other issues out there. So maybe they've got some plan for it, but
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:54.600]  Clearly it's a hindrance even if it isn't a full stop
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:36:02.360]  Even if you bring people in in shifts or or spread them out send some groups home and have other people come and sit
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:08.920]  Further apart or however you wanted to do it. It's going to be a a serious hindrance to your
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:12.380]  your collaborative environment that you built up and and that's why I feel like
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:14.920]  um when we talk about
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:16.060]  WWDC
[01:36:16.060 --> 01:36:18.380]  you know and this happens with everything with the virus is
[01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:23.980]  You don't realize the assumptions you're making until you hit one of them and you go. Oh
[01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:31.580]  You know and and WWDC is a perfect one. It's like oh, what if they don't have like literally what if they don't have
[01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:38.380]  Developer builds what if they aren't far enough along in development to know what they have confidence in mentioning in a keynote
[01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:43.660]  Because they're not far enough along to know whether they they think it's shippable or not, right?
[01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:46.060]  No, I think that may be the case
[01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:51.740]  I think it's definitely true and then the the other side of not wanting to announce a keynote date is the actual
[01:36:52.300 --> 01:36:53.640]  you know
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:55.640]  preferring to have
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:37:03.960]  An audience of some sort even if it's a steve jobs theaters sized audience, which is like roughly a thousand people instead of a five or six
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:05.480]  thousand person
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:07.480]  cavernous, you know
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:10.040]  San Jose Convention Center audience
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:14.920]  Apple likes an audience they love, you know, they love to have an audience for keynotes
[01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:19.520]  But what if it looks starts to look like it's practical safe totally safe
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:24.000]  Fine idea to do it, but probably not until the end of June
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.960]  Then, you know, I think Apple would absolutely want to hold it until the end of June
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:34.000]  Yeah to have a live event and feel safe good about it
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:37.880]  So what you know, I wouldn't be surprised honestly the more I think about it
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:41.680]  I would not be surprised if the date for the keynote is
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:47.200]  Literally not announced until like most Apple events
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:51.360]  Maybe a week a week before two weeks or two before yeah
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:54.400]  and and if I was sitting in that meeting
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:58.320]  with Phil Schiller and his team and
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:01.720]  Developer relations and you know all of those people
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:07.400]  I think the argument I would make is why we don't know how quick look how quickly this is moving
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:09.400]  We don't know where we're gonna be
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:14.760]  Why a why announce a date when we really aren't sure right? Why do it?
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:20.160]  Why and I get that there are people because I talked to a couple of them on Twitter who like are planning first off
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:21.440]  They're planning a vacation for June
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:23.440]  I'm like you may not be taking that vacation
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:28.800]  But secondly like if you're planning time off from work so that you can stay home and consume all the videos and like I get
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:32.120]  People want to plan but your plans are in question
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:37.200]  Their plans are in question like there why pick a date if you really don't have
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:41.680]  Confidence that you can hit the date and I don't see how any of us
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:46.540]  Any of us in the entire world can have confidence in something like that
[01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:53.300]  right now because it's moving so fast and if you are in charge of a big complicated system with a bunch of employees because like
[01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:58.860]  We haven't even started to talk about like what if you do bring in your employees and your key OS engineers all get
[01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:01.580]  Coronavirus right and and
[01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:07.180]  20% of your key OS engineers are laid up in bed with a fever and breathing problems and may have to go to the hospital
[01:39:07.180 --> 01:39:10.540]  Like that's also what you don't want to have happen. So
[01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:16.940]  Who can tell like it's a why why commit to anything right now. They committed to the important thing, which is yes
[01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:22.980]  We're gonna do developer resources and call it WWDC and there'll be videos and it'll be in it'll start in June and
[01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:29.820]  Like maybe they should have even said summer. Yeah, but well, yeah, I think the reason that they said June
[01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:32.820]  I think the reason they committed to June is and
[01:39:33.980 --> 01:39:36.740]  I'm glad you said that because a couple people a lot of people
[01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:44.020]  Who who listen to the show or read the site have pointed to that I think 2006
[01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:50.180]  WWDC when they postponed it till August and thought hey that might be you know, why not just punt a couple months
[01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:53.700]  That wouldn't work for Apple anymore
[01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:58.180]  No, the iPhone assuming the iPhone ships in in September, right?
[01:39:58.260 --> 01:40:02.180]  You can't have your OS unveil be the month before the phone ships
[01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:07.140]  And even if and I guess we can get to that, but even if the iPhone doesn't ship in September
[01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:10.380]  it's still
[01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:18.540]  Apple's going to want to get back on this schedule once this clears up, you know, even if it takes a year
[01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:22.480]  You know that back in those pre iPhone
[01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:29.740]  Days Apple I think wanted I think Apple always wanted to be on this roughly annual schedule
[01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:32.260]  it always seemed like they were working for it and
[01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:39.420]  They were just resource constrained and they you know, you get better at what you do, right and
[01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:42.300]  Year after year they've gotten better at it
[01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:50.220]  But you know there were gaps but you know early years of Mac OS 10 was rough were roughly annual and then it kind of got
[01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:54.660]  Knocked off the annual, you know, sometimes there are 18 months and then when the iPhone
[01:40:54.660 --> 01:41:01.900]  Was being worked on they famously had an announcement that hey, we've you know, we had a date for the next version of Mac OS 10
[01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:07.700]  But we've pulled key engineers off to work on this iPhone, you know the first version of the iPhone
[01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:09.700]  So we're gonna have to move this back six months
[01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:15.980]  They're gonna want to stay on this annual schedule and part of an Apple's annual schedule is
[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:20.540]  Getting
[01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:24.740]  the schedule is in June they tell us what's in the OS's and
[01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:29.980]  They part of the you know reason they do it at a developer conference is they want
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:32.300]  developers to start
[01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:38.980]  Working on these things right that they are announcing api's and features and they want developers to start
[01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:42.020]  updating their apps for them
[01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:47.920]  So that come fall when these things come out when these OS's come out that you know
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:50.940]  There's developer support for them. You can't do that
[01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:58.420]  If you announce them in August and then the other thing too is Apple is Apple's engineers are all heads down nose to the grindstone
[01:41:59.940 --> 01:42:03.940]  July and August finishing these things up. I mean, you know again
[01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:09.020]  The start of this podcast seems like a long time ago by our current
[01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:16.700]  situation but I think we all remember that iOS 13 was in really rough shape last summer and
[01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:20.380]  You know shipped it really weird fashion where?
[01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:26.420]  13.0 came out with the iPhones and was was out for four days
[01:42:27.260 --> 01:42:28.940]  before
[01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:30.940]  13.1 shipped
[01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:35.100]  That's you know, and that's with a
[01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:38.060]  norm quote-unquote normal
[01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:41.100]  WWDC at the beginning of June and a full summer of work
[01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:48.260]  Punting the announcement and the betas till August. It just it just wouldn't possibly fly. I mean, I
[01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:52.780]  Guess it's theoretically possible if they're already
[01:42:53.260 --> 01:43:00.060]  Willing to say the iPhone isn't going to ship till new iPhones aren't going to ship till December or January or something like that
[01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:04.300]  But I don't think they're willing to say that yet. You know, it's you know for there was an
[01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:11.660]  Announcement just last week that Foxconn announced that they're actually ahead of schedule and getting back up to date
[01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:17.540]  And they you know didn't mention Apple and specifically but you hear Foxconn. I hear Apple, right? Right?
[01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:21.500]  I do wonder if if they you know
[01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:25.740]  Obviously they will try and things are going to be weird and things are going to slip and everything's going to be a little
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:28.740]  bit weird into the future for a while, but
[01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:32.620]  You know hard to believe that the iPhone isn't going to be a priority
[01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:36.300]  It does make me wonder maybe if there are going to be some things that get deprioritized
[01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:41.860]  Right, like there are features that have been rumored that maybe we won't see right that they may take a lower priority
[01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:46.460]  Something like maybe even the Mac and say we're gonna we're gonna pull back on that
[01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:46.740]  Of course
[01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:48.740]  What if it this year is the year that they're gonna do?
[01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:51.580]  Arm on Mac and that was gonna be a big thing
[01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:56.760]  Then you can't really pull back on that. Although you might be able to say, you know, this isn't really gonna ship until
[01:43:57.420 --> 01:44:00.900]  You know next year and so you've got and take your time or something
[01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:07.140]  But they may have to make some tough decisions because I think in the end the one thing that is nothing is inviolate
[01:44:07.140 --> 01:44:09.460]  but the closest you get is
[01:44:09.740 --> 01:44:15.240]  getting that iPhone out the door and getting an iOS update that goes with it and that they they can't they will
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:21.220]  They will prioritize that over everything else. I think if they have to yeah, but I think it's really I
[01:44:22.900 --> 01:44:25.120]  Think that that June timeframe for
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:32.000]  WWDC whether WWDC is you know, the traditional in-person conference as we know it or whether it's purely virtual
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:34.560]  including the keynote where even
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:40.000]  every member of the press is watching the keynote from home over the web and
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:43.120]  Nothing is done in person
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:50.460]  It's June is sort of sets set in stone and I think they could definitely push it to the end of June and again
[01:44:50.460 --> 01:44:57.080]  Like you you've made this point a couple times. I think already in the last couple minutes is that if need be they'll cut features
[01:44:57.080 --> 01:44:59.000]  Right, but I yeah, you know
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:05.180]  But I think they cut features or they might even do a little prelude and say here are some features that are gonna be in
[01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:09.520]  Here they're not all gonna be in there because we already know that they kicked things out the last couple years
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:14.080]  Just say it up front. Like these are the features we're working on. They're not all gonna be in the developer beta
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:15.840]  They're not all gonna ship in the fall
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:22.840]  but they will ship in the next 12 months right and just move on and everybody's gonna understand right because we're all we will all
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:29.160]  Have just been through this for the past several months and know that nothing is quite like what it used to be. Yeah
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:30.400]  All right

[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:24.700]  You little yeah, I know you would care about this the editor and you I don't know what to call this damn thing
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:31.960]  COVID-19 or coronavirus. I saw you added the SARS Co SARS Co V2. Yeah
[01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:36.560]  Yeah, it's okay. So I give you the overview from my perspective
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:39.760]  which is coronavirus is a generic term for a whole family of
[01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:45.840]  Viruses that include things that cause like the common cold and it's based on like sort of how they actually look
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:50.360]  They have these little spikes that when you look at in a microscope microscope, it looks kind of like a crown
[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:55.660]  So this is a coronavirus. The thing is coronavirus is a really great
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:00.040]  Understandable commonly used term and
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:06.700]  And so I get that, you know right now when we say the coronavirus everybody gets which coronavirus we're talking about
[01:48:06.700 --> 01:48:09.040]  Yeah, we can be pedantic about it
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:15.140]  but like I think we get it in terms of common usage that that sometimes I wrote a macro piece a few weeks ago about
[01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:19.580]  WWDC and I just called it coronavirus because I like didn't want to get into it, right?
[01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:21.580]  And I think that's I think that's okay
[01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:26.120]  and and it comes all these names also come from I think a fairly good place which is
[01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:29.960]  In the olden days. We probably would call this the Wuhan virus
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:30.280]  Yeah
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:37.800]  That's where it first emerged and the feeling there is that that leads to a lot of kind of demonization of China and Chinese
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:40.840]  People all over the world which is happening anyway, by the way
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:44.600]  So like to take it away from that and say like we're not gonna make this about a city
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:47.240]  We're not gonna place blame. We're not gonna do anything like that
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:50.200]  We're just gonna call it a generic name and they came up with
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:53.000]  With with so there are two names, right?
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:57.240]  So there are two names right the virus itself is SARS Co V 2
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:05.000]  Which is basically acute respiratory like the old SARS coronavirus number 2 because this is the like
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:07.080]  It's all like the a bad sequel SARS 2
[01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:10.060]  Covid-19 is the coronavirus
[01:49:11.060 --> 01:49:14.280]  Symptoms the disease that's caused by the virus, right?
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:19.020]  Found in 2019. So technically you could have a coronavirus
[01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:25.740]  Coronavirus, which was SARS Co V 2 which was causing you to have kovat 19 symptoms, right?
[01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:32.860]  That's the chain of precision if you want to be precise about it, right and the name kovat 19 comes from
[01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:35.500]  Co is from corona
[01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:39.660]  Vi from virus the d is from disease
[01:49:39.980 --> 01:49:46.940]  Yeah, and the 19 is because 2019 is when it was first discovered in like in december and thank I do thank
[01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:53.900]  The who for just going with all caps and not lowering the o and the i right
[01:49:54.780 --> 01:49:59.740]  Or the even the you know, they like they just like tech industry would have lots of inner caps in it, right?
[01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:05.740]  But I have seen other i've seen some publications that lowercase it like as though it was the name david
[01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:09.340]  You know like capital c but then lowercase ovid 19
[01:50:09.900 --> 01:50:13.660]  Well, you know a lot of that a lot of those maybe um british and british english
[01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:18.540]  They don't capitalize acronyms, even if they're acronyms, they just put the initial cap and then they move on
[01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:20.060]  um
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:25.340]  so like you'll see them talking about nasa and it's capital n lowercase asa and you're like, that's very weird, but that's
[01:50:26.060 --> 01:50:32.240]  There's a style thing at play there. But you know, yeah i've shifted it during fireball from coronavirus
[01:50:33.580 --> 01:50:35.580]  simply to kovat 19
[01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:37.340]  and
[01:50:37.340 --> 01:50:45.100]  And I know when I made the shift. I know I knew that covet 19 was the disease not the virus and that the virus had its
[01:50:45.100 --> 01:50:46.300]  own name
[01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:47.820]  um
[01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:53.740]  But I don't it's too complicated and number and yeah also the sars cov
[01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:57.340]  sars-cov-2 is really a
[01:50:58.620 --> 01:51:01.820]  I don't know what it and what's the keyboard equivalent of a mouthful?
[01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:06.700]  Yeah, right. It's a fingerful. I don't know. I don't know it's twister with your fingers
[01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:11.100]  This comes up a lot and in in the business that we're in especially talking about technical things
[01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:17.740]  There are there's a lot of pedantry to go around and sometimes people are more concerned with people being right than being clear
[01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:21.180]  And I think you want to be right, but you want to be clear
[01:51:21.660 --> 01:51:28.560]  And if you're right, but unclear you failed and so one that's why like I knew the difference between covet 19 and sars-cov-2
[01:51:29.180 --> 01:51:35.660]  And coronavirus when I wrote that first coronavirus piece for mac world and I still went with coronavirus because I felt like
[01:51:35.660 --> 01:51:39.900]  Like first off it's not a piece about viruses that i'm going to explain how it works
[01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:44.780]  And second everybody knows what I mean when I say coronavirus, so i'm going to choose to be clear
[01:51:45.500 --> 01:51:52.060]  And not pedantic about it. And and I think it's a decision also a lot of the context you're writing about
[01:51:52.620 --> 01:51:59.100]  Are about stopping the spread of covet 19 and that's accurate because we're trying to stop the spread of the disease
[01:51:59.340 --> 01:52:03.580]  That's caused by the virus not just the virus. It's it's it all goes together
[01:52:03.580 --> 01:52:09.920]  Right. I totally get it that if you are working at the cdc or you're a scientist
[01:52:10.460 --> 01:52:15.740]  And you're working on this the difference between the virus and the disease the virus gives you
[01:52:17.100 --> 01:52:22.060]  Is incredibly important fundamental, you know, it's totally different people working on totally different things, right?
[01:52:22.060 --> 01:52:29.340]  There's different people studying the virus than the type of people who are working on how to manage the actual disease totally get it
[01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:32.140]  I get it, but from
[01:52:32.140 --> 01:52:38.300]  My perspective and the the level that i'm writing about it. I just need a name and my shift was mainly
[01:52:38.940 --> 01:52:43.020]  I think I was thrown off a little bit because I tend to defer to the new york times
[01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:48.860]  I I i'm an avid reader of the times and I know that they're pedantic about such things
[01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:51.740]  And they're still even to this day
[01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:57.040]  Pretty not that they never mentioned covet 19, but they're pretty much all in on coronavirus
[01:52:57.900 --> 01:53:00.140]  Yeah, but my shift last week
[01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:06.860]  Toward covet 19 was that I knew all along what you said that coronavirus is a generic term and that
[01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:09.360]  The sars from a couple years ago was a coronavirus
[01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:12.060]  and that there will be
[01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:14.160]  More there will be future coronaviruses
[01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:21.260]  You know it hopefully not for a long time, but it's inevitable, you know, they're they're it's going to happen again
[01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:25.840]  Um, my shift last week was that I was always a little uncomfortable
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:29.600]  Just using coronavirus because I knew it was a generic term
[01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:33.280]  But I also felt comfortable with it because that's what the times seemed to be doing
[01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:37.680]  And it's what I knew everybody who was reading during fireball would know exactly what I was talking about
[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:41.840]  My discomfort with using the generic term
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:50.480]  Reached a point last week where I was like if I start using covet 19 instead everybody is there i'm not going to lose one
[01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:53.120]  single reader there
[01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:57.760]  it although somebody told me I swear to god this is a true story I forget who told me this somebody told me that they
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:53:59.600]  had like a
[01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:01.200]  uh
[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:04.800]  Relative who had been like planning this for like
[01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:08.480]  Over well over a year and that he and his wife their dream
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:12.100]  Was to go on like a month-long vacation
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:14.880]  um
[01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:17.520]  Into complete isolation no phones
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:21.120]  Just like and they're like outdoors type people camping
[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:22.560]  And just tune out of the world
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:28.720]  and the guy's a big basketball fan and he's like I he's you know, he's like
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:35.680]  Kobe Bryant's dead and it's like oh no, is that why everybody's you know, they know that's not why everybody's upset anymore
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:39.280]  Uh sit down
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:42.880]  Can you I mean, can you even imagine it's it's crazy
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:50.480]  But anyway, I felt like last week we easily crashed across the threshold where covet 19 was at least as well known as
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:53.680]  As well known as coronavirus and i've i've shifted to using it
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:59.700]  And though i'm reluctant to i'm going with the all caps because I don't I don't feel like lower casing it is appropriate
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:03.280]  Yeah, well
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:05.200]  I I agree with your choices
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:11.840]  but I I think this also is a little window into when people a lot of times people send in corrections and things and they think
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:13.040]  that
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:16.880]  Decisions are made carelessly and a lot of times you don't you know, we don't talk about the care
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:21.760]  but we we think about it like we we are concerned about how we're being uh,
[01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:28.480]  interpreted and sometimes it does come down to am I going to confuse people because like if I if I have to be
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:32.960]  If i'm right, but then I have to explain all the reasons why i'm right
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:37.600]  Sometimes the decision is i'm not going to be that right i'm going to vague it up a little bit
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:43.040]  So that everybody still understands it and I don't have to stop and explain myself because it starts to get a little showy
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:47.760]  You know sometimes where you're showing off like i'm going to use this very particular term that nobody knows
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:50.640]  And then explain it and it's like it's better to use the term
[01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:57.120]  Everybody knows just do that if your goal is not to show off but to communicate. All right, so back to the apple at least
[01:55:58.620 --> 01:56:01.440]  Ramifications at a high level of this we've covered
[01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:04.380]  internally apple is
[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:09.840]  Really culturally and policy wise not really set up for remote work on a lot of new stuff
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:14.560]  Um, but you know that got you know, gotta do what you gotta do. I mean, this isn't even I don't even think
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:18.880]  There's a debate at this point, you know, you got to work from home and we'll make don't make the best of it
[01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:23.040]  Wwdc covered
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:32.560]  I guess I went out of chronological order. The other thing is were reports, you know earlier earlier this month that apple had been planning
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:35.120]  a late march
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:40.800]  Press event of some sort to announce new products and we all know stuff that's been rumored
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:43.600]  there were there have been long-standing rumors of
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:46.640]  Some sort of
[01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:48.640]  successor to the iphone se
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:54.560]  Which I really don't think is going to be called the iphone se2 but more or less than I what we know is the iphone 8
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:58.640]  hardware wise aesthetic wise updated with the
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:04.720]  Internals from probably an iphone 11 in terms of yeah, it's a series chip. Um
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:08.560]  Uh
[01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:14.400]  I maybe new ipad pros which are like 18 months old or who knows what else?
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:20.400]  Uh, there could be new macbooks. There could be you know, there's a bunch of products they have that wouldn't be
[01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:27.600]  Worthy of a major flagship event but would certainly have been in a normal in normal times
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:33.600]  worthy of some sort of event and as I pointed out on this show, I think with federico, but
[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:38.240]  You know apple's a company of patterns and they have a you know
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:44.480]  Obviously, we know they have the annual pattern of wwdc in june and new iphones in september
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:47.040]  But they have a biannual
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:52.000]  pattern in recent years of having an event in late march where in
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:57.520]  The last few years in the even-numbered years. They've had events in late march and in the odd ones
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:01.920]  They haven't and I don't think that's a coincidence, you know, I think that's part of the cycle for some of these products
[01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:03.920]  Which don't have an annual schedule
[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:08.960]  Yeah, the ipad feels like it's an 18-month cycle, right? So that would be in the spring
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:13.520]  Every other year and in the fall every other year. Yeah, and you know, there were reports
[01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:18.240]  I don't know a week or a week and a half ago or something like that a couple of it leaked to a couple of
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:20.640]  outlets
[01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:22.640]  Outlets, um
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:24.640]  You know that apple had been planning
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:29.760]  It was going to cancel it because even then the writing was on the wall even when things were still, you know
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:34.800]  Even then in the long ago times of 10 days ago seemed pretty clear
[01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:36.800]  There was not it was not practical
[01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:41.040]  Or even just advisable even if things hadn't gotten worse in the last 10 days
[01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:46.080]  Even then it just seemed totally an ill advisable to to gather people and you know
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:48.240]  in a room together
[01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:53.760]  And and you know, just imagine the the the the pr risks of oh my god
[01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:56.400]  you know apple had these people come out to an event and
[01:58:57.200 --> 01:59:01.680]  Uh, three of them got the coronavirus or something like that, you know, nobody's going to take a risk like that
[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:07.040]  It's it was crazy. But then what does apple do if they have these products ready to go, but they can't hold an event
[01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:14.000]  Yeah, exactly and and the thing mike hurley and I were talking about this earlier today. Um
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:16.560]  supply chains
[01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:23.040]  It a supply chain is not exactly a conveyor belt, but it's kind of a conveyor belt right like at some point
[01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:28.160]  Before the product gets announced, especially if it's going to ship like that friday
[01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:33.840]  um, they stop making the old product and they start making the new product and
[01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:37.120]  You can't
[01:59:37.120 --> 01:59:40.720]  Just not like unless you're willing to have your old product go out of stores
[01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:45.040]  And go out of uh being able to I mean the stores are closed but buy it online
[01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:50.480]  You at some point you got to flip the switch. And so this is the debate also about like would you announce a new apple product?
[01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:54.800]  Now when all this else is going on and the answer is I wouldn't launch a brand new
[01:59:55.360 --> 02:00:01.120]  platform that I want the world's attention on but if I want to if I want to do an iphone se or I want to
[02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:07.680]  I want to do a minor laptop update or whatever it is like sure why not plus plus i've run out of laptops
[02:00:07.680 --> 02:00:10.480]  Or i've run out of iphones to sell in the in that category
[02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:13.360]  Because I stopped making them so I can make the new one
[02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:18.160]  So sometimes it's it's out of your hand where out of your hands where it's really like no now
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:21.680]  We need to we we need to go ahead and do this. We we we made them
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:26.960]  They're in boxes. We we've started to ship them over here. We need to actually start selling them
[02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:30.560]  Yeah, and it's you know as much as day-to-day life
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:35.680]  And in the flesh has changed dramatically for so many of us
[02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:41.920]  And so many more to come and just in terms of doing what's right and or even what's mandated by our local governments
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:45.840]  Getting stuff delivered is still that that that is actually the alternative, right?
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:51.520]  Yeah, that's this is what this is how we're eating and so like if let's just say I mean
[02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:56.880]  I think that that the most likely of all of these is this iphone se2 this new lower cost iphone
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:02.560]  Apple can do that. It's never you know, it's not a spectacular new product that the iphone se wasn't it is
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:05.120]  it is a a spot in the
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:12.800]  A spot in the um product lineup and a very important one because it's the one that an awful lot of
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:19.040]  Tens and tens probably I don't know tens of millions of people want which is
[02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:20.720]  uh
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:22.720]  I want one that's a lower price
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:24.320]  and
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:30.080]  For a lot of other people I want one that's familiar, you know the fact that it's uh, you know
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:35.920]  Uses the same home button and fingerprint sensor is the one that they you know, the iphone 6 they might be replacing
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:42.960]  That is a boon to an awful lot of people, you know, I mentioned my mom before my mom definitely wants one
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:47.040]  I told her about it. I said I think this is coming, you know, you know, I I always tell you I don't
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:52.560]  You know, my mom doesn't believe me. Mom thinks that I know everything, you know for sure and I just won't tell her
[02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:57.360]  I'm like i'm telling you apple doesn't tell me stuff like this, but I know how to read these rumors
[02:01:57.360 --> 02:02:02.320]  I'm telling you. I think this is what come and you know, I forget I think she has a six either six or success
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:04.400]  But she does need a new phone
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:07.600]  She's like that's the one I want I don't I don't you know
[02:02:07.680 --> 02:02:11.920]  She just she just doesn't want to switch to the new thing where there's no button, you know
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:17.760]  That's a big deal, but they can just do that and you know all of a sudden if you want a 500 ish
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:21.040]  Dollar iphone you get this one which has new
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:28.500]  Dewey internals which have years and years ahead of them in os support and better battery efficiency, etc. Etc. Etc. Etc
[02:02:29.700 --> 02:02:32.100]  yeah, well if you're if you're a um, like
[02:02:32.740 --> 02:02:38.420]  Uh dan moran who I work with on six colors like dan has an old macbook air that is yes
[02:02:38.660 --> 02:02:41.620]  has serious battery problems and has given up the ghost and like
[02:02:42.180 --> 02:02:43.700]  and now he's
[02:02:43.700 --> 02:02:48.660]  And so many people now are are in are at home and they've got a laptop and this is what they have to do
[02:02:48.660 --> 02:02:53.380]  So if apple comes out with a new macbook air or you know or other new mac laptops
[02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:56.340]  You know, I think some people are going to be like, oh, thank god
[02:02:56.420 --> 02:03:01.860]  I I can just order this and it'll be here in a few days and like yes, we're in unusual circumstances here
[02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:04.900]  But it doesn't mean that people
[02:03:05.860 --> 02:03:11.700]  Might not actually really want a new whatever or need a new whatever to do what they're doing
[02:03:11.700 --> 02:03:12.340]  and in fact
[02:03:12.340 --> 02:03:17.540]  These may be the perfect circumstances where they're like they need it more than before more than they knew
[02:03:17.540 --> 02:03:22.840]  That they needed so i'm not saying that this is the reason that apple releases it, but I think if apple releases
[02:03:23.460 --> 02:03:27.700]  New stuff like that. There are going to be people who are very happy to get it and they'll order it online
[02:03:27.780 --> 02:03:29.780]  it'll get delivered to their house and
[02:03:29.780 --> 02:03:36.260]  And you know, they'll be happy and apple doesn't one of the reasons apple likes to hold the big showy events
[02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:42.840]  Isn't just for pure publicity for publicity sake they like to tell a story and they want to tell it from their perspective
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:47.000]  Here's what it's for. Here's why we made it. Here's why it is the way that it is
[02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:52.600]  You don't need to explain an updated iphone 8 that has iphone 11 internals
[02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:59.400]  You don't need to explain a new macbook air that has the uh scissor key switches from the 16-inch
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:04.040]  They already told that story right? They already told that story and they didn't do that in an event either
[02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:06.200]  They did it at very small press gatherings
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:09.640]  um or gathering I guess, uh
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:13.480]  You know, however, you want to call it, but you know relatively small they brought us in in shifts
[02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:19.960]  But yeah, it was the same day, right? So yeah, but it's even less of a story once you put that same keyboard design
[02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:21.960]  Into a second model, right?
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:24.680]  Yeah, there's not I mean we we get all caught up on it
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:31.400]  But like apple making a minor update to an old product to be slightly different for most of the world
[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:36.280]  Isn't that interesting a story right it's believe it or not not that interesting even if it's a big deal for us
[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:40.920]  We're like finally the macbook air has a new keyboard or finally there's a modern processor in that old
[02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:49.320]  Phone design like those are big deals on in one context, but in the grand scheme of things even without this pandemic happening
[02:04:49.880 --> 02:04:52.680]  It's not that big a deal. It's a little thing now if
[02:04:53.540 --> 02:05:00.200]  Hypothetically speaking and I don't think this is true at all. I think this is actually incredibly unlikely from everything we've heard
[02:05:00.200 --> 02:05:07.080]  but let's just say for the sake of argument that apple in fact has a brand new ar product some kind of
[02:05:07.480 --> 02:05:13.400]  Goggle glasses type thing and it in fact had been thinking they would announce it at the end of march
[02:05:13.400 --> 02:05:19.320]  And it was going to be a big showy event like when they first introduced the apple watch. Yep, and
[02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:24.680]  You know, maybe it was going to be like apple watch where they announced it and they were going to say it
[02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:28.680]  We're going to ship later this year, you know, which of course means december or december
[02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:31.320]  Which of course means december or something like that
[02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:36.040]  But they were going to have this event in march so they could show it and demo it and get everybody excited and get on
[02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:37.080]  top of it
[02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:42.040]  Uh, yeah, they're not going to announce that with a press release there if if that were had been the case
[02:05:42.200 --> 02:05:45.480]  I don't think it was but if it were they would literally just say well
[02:05:46.120 --> 02:05:48.920]  You know back to the nose to the grindstone team. Let's keep working on it
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:54.280]  But we're going to you know, hold our powder and yes now is not the time for that big show
[02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:57.880]  We announced right because you want people to pay attention and talk about that one, right?
[02:05:57.880 --> 02:06:00.440]  And then you know, they'll go instead of late march, maybe
[02:06:00.900 --> 02:06:06.680]  Wwdc and maybe if wwdc isn't a big deal. Maybe we'll hold it all the way till september, you know, and
[02:06:07.400 --> 02:06:12.220]  You know in normal times a company isn't going to hold a a blockbuster
[02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:17.080]  Product announcement six months, but these are not normal times and you know
[02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:21.880]  But they would do that if it was something that was of of that magnitude, you know, I agree
[02:06:22.520 --> 02:06:27.160]  I don't even think there's any question. I think you know, but yeah, no, that's that's the and that's the difference, right?
[02:06:27.160 --> 02:06:31.160]  They're the ones where you really want the world to stand up and pay attention. Here's a new huge thing from apple
[02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:32.920]  This is a major initiative
[02:06:32.920 --> 02:06:38.780]  And then there are the product updates that are nice like a a brand new iMac a brand new laptop
[02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:45.720]  And then there are the ones that are the incremental moves forward which if you're dan and you've been waiting for that new macbook air
[02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:49.960]  With the new with a good keyboard all of this time. It's a big deal to you
[02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:53.800]  But in the grand scheme of things, it's a little and it's just a little thing
[02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:57.240]  And again, if the fact that they wouldn't even have to talk about the keyboard
[02:06:58.280 --> 02:07:01.960]  Could just say here it is. Go buy it. Isn't it? Great. It's got new processors
[02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:05.560]  It's got that magic keyboard. We already told you about awesome now available buy it
[02:07:06.920 --> 02:07:13.240]  The magic keyboard that millions of macbook pro 16 inch users already love. Yeah. Yeah, you know that great keyboard
[02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:15.240]  We told you about it's got that. Okay, gotta go
[02:07:18.120 --> 02:07:20.120]  They closed the retail stores last week
[02:07:20.120 --> 02:07:24.600]  Well, I you know at the time what day was that? I don't even remember saturday
[02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:30.440]  Oh, you know and it was so I I know some people who work in apple retail and I was getting these these items early
[02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:33.160]  in the week, they're like we're gonna cancel all of our our
[02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:40.440]  Our show and tell kind of event things. We're gonna we're move seating, uh or move half the seating
[02:07:40.520 --> 02:07:45.480]  So we don't want to encourage people to be a crowd and we want to move them in and out and like that was that
[02:07:45.480 --> 02:07:50.760]  Was big moves on monday and by friday it was like now that we just have to close all the stores
[02:07:51.080 --> 02:07:57.900]  Uh a couple of df readers, you know pointed out because that announcement came the next day after the wwdc
[02:07:58.600 --> 02:08:00.600]  Is going to be online only
[02:08:00.920 --> 02:08:05.320]  Not a cancellation but actually a cancellation or you know, whatever you want to call it. Um
[02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:11.480]  And you know immediately a couple of readers pointed out that hey, what about the retail stores?
[02:08:11.480 --> 02:08:15.800]  Isn't this ridiculous that there isn't it greedy that they're keeping these stores open when?
[02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:22.200]  You know people are coming in and touching these devices. Isn't that you know, and in some ways the apple stores are particularly
[02:08:23.060 --> 02:08:26.360]  Operating as they normally do particularly bad
[02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:29.080]  for
[02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:30.180]  This
[02:08:30.180 --> 02:08:33.000]  Coronavirus thing because a the stores are usually crowded
[02:08:33.560 --> 02:08:34.600]  bad
[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:40.280]  The whole point of them from a consumer retail basis is trying these devices
[02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:45.640]  That are either touch screen devices or laptops with keyboards, right?
[02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:48.360]  I mean you can't go into an apple store and not see people typing on
[02:08:48.900 --> 02:08:54.280]  Macbooks or playing with new iphones, right? It's it's a nightmare, right? How do you sanitize that?
[02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:57.160]  Yeah, and if you take them you can't sanitize it, right?
[02:08:57.480 --> 02:09:01.000]  So you take them all away then what's the point of remaining open as a store?
[02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:04.360]  Uh, so I think it was inevitable
[02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:07.880]  Um, and you know as a as a repair
[02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:14.380]  Air interface my understanding is like people who are getting their max repaired are getting called to come in and get them
[02:09:14.540 --> 02:09:17.820]  yeah, and that they they may even have some sort of method where you can
[02:09:18.380 --> 02:09:22.460]  um say I need to bring this in and they'll give you a time and you come and you hand it to them and then
[02:09:22.860 --> 02:09:25.420]  They right like they they'll they maybe do some of that
[02:09:25.580 --> 02:09:30.940]  But the whole other purpose of the store like it it doesn't make sense right now and in china they reopen them, right?
[02:09:30.940 --> 02:09:33.820]  So there's there's this feeling that maybe you get over the hump a little bit
[02:09:33.820 --> 02:09:38.300]  Yeah, and then you have a strategy maybe for what they look like post closure
[02:09:38.460 --> 02:09:42.460]  Yeah, and then you and then you do some some opening but who knows?
[02:09:43.020 --> 02:09:48.300]  Uh, I speculated, you know on the support issue. Uh, hey, what what the heck's going on with the support staff though?
[02:09:48.300 --> 02:09:52.780]  You know, are they all they can't all be working together. It turns out I heard from a bunch of readers
[02:09:52.940 --> 02:09:57.260]  Uh that I don't know how what percentage I guess nobody does because like everything else at apple
[02:09:57.260 --> 02:10:04.700]  It's all secret but a large a large percentage of apple's apple care support technicians already have worked for home
[02:10:04.860 --> 02:10:07.660]  For a long time like the apple care people you you get the job
[02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:15.420]  And apple sends you an imac or something, you know a computer and they hook up a dedicated landline telephone
[02:10:15.740 --> 02:10:20.140]  You know you get hardware they set you up with everything from a computer to phone
[02:10:21.020 --> 02:10:26.140]  And you work from home and that's been the case for a while and whether that was prescient or lucky
[02:10:26.140 --> 02:10:31.100]  Either way, i'm sure apple will take it. Um, because you know, I don't know how many
[02:10:31.740 --> 02:10:37.340]  Thousands tens of thousands of people, you know in the united states and other countries affected by this
[02:10:37.340 --> 02:10:40.140]  Obviously all of western europe is affected by this severely
[02:10:40.860 --> 02:10:44.700]  I don't know how many thousands of people come in for tech support on a daily basis to apple stores
[02:10:44.700 --> 02:10:46.700]  But every single one of them is now
[02:10:47.980 --> 02:10:50.540]  Online or on the phone to apple care. So
[02:10:50.540 --> 02:10:58.060]  You know the fact that that's largely work at home already, thank goodness because if it weren't man that that that's just that's a serious problem
[02:10:58.380 --> 02:11:01.100]  If people couldn't even get tech support, right?
[02:11:02.300 --> 02:11:08.620]  Uh, what else is on my list here before we wrap up, uh, I know we've gone long surprise surprise for us
[02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:14.460]  The last thing I wanted to talk about I and this idea i've i've gotten this idea
[02:11:14.460 --> 02:11:17.980]  I don't know if people have sent it to you. I've gotten this idea in email i've gotten him
[02:11:17.980 --> 02:11:24.860]  I've gotten this idea in email i've gotten him on twitter, but lots of people are having this idea that apple could
[02:11:25.100 --> 02:11:28.780]  Update apple watch to give rewards for staying at home
[02:11:30.540 --> 02:11:34.540]  And you know in terms of encouraging people to to do what every
[02:11:34.860 --> 02:11:41.420]  Expert is saying and and stay at home as much as you can't do the social, you know, social distancing as the president tweeted
[02:11:41.420 --> 02:11:48.460]  Social distancing. That's right. Um, and could apple watch give us awards for this to sort of make you feel good about it
[02:11:48.460 --> 02:11:51.660]  And tell you hey, you've got a three-day streak of not leaving the house way to go
[02:11:52.860 --> 02:11:58.460]  um, I love the sentiment because I am totally on board with this and I totally get it and it's such a tough thing to
[02:11:58.460 --> 02:12:03.820]  Do because let's say it works out as ideally as possible and it really does it not only stretch
[02:12:04.220 --> 02:12:09.340]  Flattens the curve but it actually lowers the number of people who wind up contracting
[02:12:09.340 --> 02:12:13.820]  Contracting covet 19 and that this whole thing winds up a lot
[02:12:14.700 --> 02:12:19.020]  On on the the optimistic end of the ways that this might realistically turn out
[02:12:19.580 --> 02:12:25.660]  You know that in that scenario there are going to be an awful lot of shit birds who say well see it was no big deal
[02:12:26.220 --> 02:12:27.740]  Yeah, right
[02:12:27.740 --> 02:12:33.900]  We know it. Everybody knows it. That is human nature. That's going to happen if we are so fortunate enough
[02:12:33.900 --> 02:12:38.540]  Wouldn't that be a wonderful problem to have if the biggest problem we have at the end of this is
[02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:40.620]  A bunch of people saying it was all over blown
[02:12:42.140 --> 02:12:44.140]  Yep, uh
[02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:51.100]  So I get it but I don't think that's possible a I don't think you can add a word like that
[02:12:51.580 --> 02:12:55.100]  To apple to watch os on on a dime. It doesn't work like that
[02:12:55.100 --> 02:13:00.460]  And I don't even know if you know, how does it track whether you actually left the house? Not every apple watches gps enabled
[02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:03.500]  Yeah, and they're and they're all um
[02:13:03.500 --> 02:13:11.500]  The code is is using like movement and distance and not not movement. So how would you how would you do that in terms of
[02:13:12.140 --> 02:13:14.380]  Of I I did I do think it's a great idea
[02:13:14.380 --> 02:13:19.740]  I think it would be a great idea if they had and and maybe they're thinking of these for for the future now, but like
[02:13:20.540 --> 02:13:27.500]  What if it reminded you to wash your hands? What is it? Like like there are lots of things that that it could do but i'm not sure
[02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:33.900]  Using the apple watch reward system is something that it's just capable of of doing and how would it be measured and it's not
[02:13:34.380 --> 02:13:38.060]  It's a great idea that I that I i'm with you. I don't think it's technically feasible
[02:13:38.060 --> 02:13:41.020]  But I think it's a fun idea because what you really want to do is give people incentives
[02:13:41.340 --> 02:13:47.740]  To have good behavior because that's what the apple watch is all about is giving people incentives to exercise so this would be similar
[02:13:47.980 --> 02:13:52.060]  I just don't think it's practical. Yeah, and washing your hands is a great example of that where again
[02:13:52.060 --> 02:13:56.940]  I don't think it couldn't happen now, but in terms of thinking hey, where would you be if you had to wash your hands
[02:13:56.940 --> 02:13:59.740]  Hey, where might be we be with wearables in 10 years?
[02:14:00.380 --> 02:14:07.440]  Uh, I I that actually seems to me like something that could be detected, you know with the combination of microphones
[02:14:08.060 --> 02:14:10.060]  And you know the accelerometer
[02:14:12.140 --> 02:14:14.140]  Maybe you know it
[02:14:14.140 --> 02:14:17.260]  You know in theory that that would be great if it were possible
[02:14:17.260 --> 02:14:22.300]  But it's just not but I love the thinking every single person who suggested this to me. I'm not putting you down
[02:14:22.380 --> 02:14:24.220]  I'm, just telling you. I don't think it's practical. It's a fan
[02:14:24.220 --> 02:14:28.700]  Your your heart's in the right place and it's a very cool science fiction-y type idea
[02:14:29.340 --> 02:14:30.300]  um
[02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:31.740]  I want the um
[02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:36.380]  When I get home from being out in the world the the you should wash your hands now
[02:14:37.100 --> 02:14:42.140]  That'd be a good one, right? Yeah, that actually seems you know, technically possible at the moment, you know
[02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:45.580]  Eventually, we'll get an apple watch that has its built-in hand sanitizer
[02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:49.580]  Uh
[02:14:49.580 --> 02:14:51.580]  I guess that's it. Good luck
[02:14:51.580 --> 02:14:53.580]  Good luck to you. You know what?
[02:14:53.740 --> 02:15:00.380]  Yeah, stay safe. Stay inside stay healthy. I I I I will and I will say this I I it's my hope
[02:15:00.380 --> 02:15:04.060]  I know that a lot of you have been reaching out to to you know
[02:15:04.060 --> 02:15:10.860]  Those of us who are on the content producing side of things like podcasts and you want more contact content. I'm i'm with you
[02:15:11.100 --> 02:15:13.100]  I'm going to do as many shows as I can
[02:15:13.740 --> 02:15:15.740]  I'm in the house. I'll be here
[02:15:15.980 --> 02:15:17.340]  Got my mic
[02:15:17.340 --> 02:15:23.100]  uh, I I want to keep you as occupied as you can get your mind on fun stuff like
[02:15:23.640 --> 02:15:31.420]  shortcuts and apple script and speculation about ipad multitasking the more my mind is on stuff like that the better I feel too and I
[02:15:32.060 --> 02:15:35.580]  You know jason i'm sure you feel the same way, you know, it's
[02:15:36.380 --> 02:15:40.140]  Again, I think I forget exactly what I wrote the other day, but it's like more
[02:15:40.220 --> 02:15:42.860]  There's not you feel so helpless and it's like I feel like
[02:15:42.860 --> 02:15:47.820]  Do do the little things you can you know in terms of social distancing washing your hands. Um,
[02:15:48.700 --> 02:15:55.340]  You know and for me, what can I do? I can try to you know, write cool stuff and do good podcasts and you know
[02:15:55.420 --> 02:15:59.740]  Make everybody out there give you something to get your mind off it. There's only so much netflix you can watch
[02:16:00.700 --> 02:16:01.820]  Yeah
[02:16:01.820 --> 02:16:07.020]  And there's only so much news you should watch because you will whether it's a website or a tv news or whatever it is
[02:16:07.020 --> 02:16:11.900]  It will it'll drive you mad because there's only one thing happening right now and although it's important
[02:16:11.900 --> 02:16:15.180]  I think you stare at that too long and you'll lose your mind a little bit
[02:16:15.180 --> 02:16:20.300]  So, um if we can do if we can divert you even though we talked about it a lot in this episode
[02:16:20.300 --> 02:16:23.740]  But if we can if we can divert you a little bit or have you think about it in a different way
[02:16:24.140 --> 02:16:27.500]  I think I think that's good. I think I think everybody needs to
[02:16:28.300 --> 02:16:31.980]  Keep their mind going to a bunch of different places instead of just getting focused on one thing
[02:16:31.980 --> 02:16:39.020]  Especially if you're housebound for you know for the first time. Yeah. Hey net news wire is out for ios now the new version
[02:16:39.020 --> 02:16:43.900]  So good, but in terms of hey go get it, uh, and sync ups, you know
[02:16:43.900 --> 02:16:48.780]  Get a bunch of feeds that don't have anything to do with the news news and there's another you know
[02:16:48.780 --> 02:16:52.460]  It'll be better than twitter in terms of keeping your mind off this stuff. Yep
[02:16:52.620 --> 02:16:55.660]  Because I trust me none of us are going to have to do a damn thing
[02:16:56.380 --> 02:17:02.060]  To hear about it as much more than we want to um, anyway, jason. Thanks for taking your time
[02:17:02.060 --> 02:17:04.940]  What a crazy time to do this. Hopefully, um,
[02:17:05.740 --> 02:17:07.740]  Hopefully everything's going to work out

[02:17:35.100 --> 02:17:40.780]  It was a member benefit that we did a couple years ago, which is we we all got on a call and watched star wars
[02:17:41.340 --> 02:17:44.620]  And we talked about it while we were watching it and you can you can put star wars
[02:17:45.820 --> 02:17:51.420]  On your tv and press play on the file on the incomparable and uh, it's like you're sitting there with john
[02:17:51.420 --> 02:17:56.620]  Syracuse and dan moran and kelly gamond and a bunch of other people and they're talking about star wars while you're watching it
[02:17:56.620 --> 02:18:02.460]  Which is pretty fun. So we put that out because same thing right trying to give people some stuff that to divert them from
[02:18:02.460 --> 02:18:09.100]  To divert them from everything while they're trapped in their houses and that reminds me. I did not do my usual
