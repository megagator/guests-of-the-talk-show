[00:00.000 --> 00:02.880]  We've got to pack a three-hour show into about 90 minutes here, René.
[00:02.880 --> 00:03.600]  We can do it.
[00:03.600 --> 00:10.160]  I think we can. No baseball, no sports, no movies, nothing like that. We've got to get right to work.
[00:10.160 --> 00:10.660]  Okay.
[00:11.600 --> 00:14.640]  We've got a good list of topics. I'm going to say, number one, I want to talk
[00:15.200 --> 00:20.480]  about MacBook keyboard failures. It's a recurring theme on the show,
[00:20.480 --> 00:26.560]  and in between the last episode of this show and us talking today, a fellow I know
[00:26.560 --> 00:34.080]  got hit by the speck of dust of doom, and that fellow would be you.
[00:34.080 --> 00:40.400]  Yeah. Like you, I think we both had a bunch of different review units since they came out in
[00:40.400 --> 00:46.160]  2016. They were the original Skylake ones. They were last year's Kaby Lake ones. Between MacBooks
[00:46.160 --> 00:51.360]  and MacBook Pros, my own and Apple's, I've probably gone through eight, and I've used two or three of
[00:51.360 --> 00:58.320]  them consistently, and I never had any problem. And then two weeks ago, the control key stopped
[00:58.320 --> 01:03.120]  working. And I don't use a control key often. I use it for terminal and ludicrously to pick up,
[01:03.120 --> 01:07.760]  to pull out the emoji keyboard picker. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[01:07.760 --> 01:09.520]  And I wasn't able to do that anymore.
[01:11.680 --> 01:18.000]  For people who do not know, you can type on a Mac, you can type control command space,
[01:18.000 --> 01:24.000]  and it brings up the emoji picker. And it's a fantastic feature. It's funny. I've kind of
[01:24.000 --> 01:29.920]  gotten away from tips and tricks in recent years. I don't know why, but it's like, I've started,
[01:29.920 --> 01:34.400]  I'll get to some later that are on the show notes, but that's another one. And it's like,
[01:34.400 --> 01:37.760]  I know that there's some cool third party utilities that help with emoji and stuff like that.
[01:37.760 --> 01:42.000]  But I think if people knew about the command control space and the fact that you can search,
[01:42.000 --> 01:48.480]  uh, yes, it's, it's a fantastic feature. It's so it's like, you know, you type flower and
[01:48.480 --> 01:52.960]  it's like all the flower emoji show up. Um, Oh, I love this feature. But anyway,
[01:52.960 --> 01:56.480]  yeah, I can't reassign it. So if the control key is gone, you just, you can't use it.
[02:01.600 --> 02:04.720]  Which exact model was this? It was a Mac book pro, correct?
[02:05.600 --> 02:08.720]  Uh, yeah, it was a 13 inch Mac book pro with the touch bar.
[02:08.720 --> 02:12.080]  All right. So what's the current status? So you made a video. I have it in the show notes.
[02:12.080 --> 02:15.840]  It will be there and you can, you know, you went through the rigmarole with the, uh,
[02:16.720 --> 02:22.480]  Apple support document where you hold the Mac book at a precise 61 degree angle
[02:24.000 --> 02:27.600]  and then hold the can of air at a 57 degree angle.
[02:27.600 --> 02:31.680]  Yeah. And you can't go too far because then it'll push cold out and not dust and you'll get,
[02:31.680 --> 02:34.400]  not that I did this too often, but you'll get like frozen stuff.
[02:34.400 --> 02:40.400]  I think that's why some people like, uh, you know, it's just like everything in life where
[02:40.400 --> 02:43.760]  it's like you can go really cheap or really expensive, but I know some people
[02:43.760 --> 02:49.440]  have those, uh, instead of buying the aerosol cans of compressed air, you can get like an
[02:49.440 --> 02:54.320]  actual mechanical device, you know, which I think solves that problem of, of when you hold it at a
[02:54.320 --> 02:59.200]  weird angle, it turns to ice and you worry that you're about to give yourself frostbite or
[02:59.200 --> 03:04.000]  something like that. Yeah, no, I went through all of that and it worked ish. If I hit the
[03:04.000 --> 03:10.320]  control key a little more briskly than I usually hit keys and I hit, I bias towards the left side,
[03:10.320 --> 03:16.000]  it works, but it's not, it's not comfortable. Um, I have, I have been shown how to take the key off.
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.840]  I have friends in the industry and they've shown like an easy way of taking the key off. So I'll
[03:19.840 --> 03:23.680]  probably do that next, pop it off, clean it more thoroughly, pop it back on. You know,
[03:23.680 --> 03:30.160]  I've heard that taking the keys off this model of keyboard, it's in the litany of things that
[03:30.160 --> 03:34.960]  are bad about this keyboard design. What I've heard is that it is a precarious, uh,
[03:35.760 --> 03:42.160]  it is very precarious and that you can damage it, you know, and that in fact it's so easy to do that
[03:42.160 --> 03:48.000]  even people who take it in for service, like the genius or might try to do it and therefore it's
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.680]  covered, but then it's like, Oh, broke a little piece of plastic. Now the whole top piece has
[03:51.680 --> 03:55.920]  to go back and be replaced. Yeah. Like apparently the space bar is just impossible cause it will
[03:55.920 --> 04:01.360]  break if you try to take it off. Yeah. Some of the other keys aren't as dangerous. Um,
[04:01.360 --> 04:06.240]  so I might try that or I might just take it to the gym. I use my space bar. Yes.
[04:08.640 --> 04:12.240]  So what does Casey Neistat apparently he had a huge complaints about the space bar. All right.
[04:12.240 --> 04:16.880]  So your current status is you haven't taken it in for service. You're thinking about performing
[04:16.880 --> 04:20.880]  surgery and you know what the worst part is control is the one, you know, there's, there's
[04:20.880 --> 04:25.280]  option in command on both sides, but only one can. Yeah, absolutely. And I should preface this by
[04:25.280 --> 04:30.160]  saying that, um, I, I, I didn't have any problems at all with these keyboards. My previous generation
[04:30.160 --> 04:35.280]  Mac book before this new keyboard, the scissors, which one I had the E key fail and I took it in
[04:35.280 --> 04:41.200]  and I had, it was like $500 because they had to swap out the entire top case and battery
[04:41.200 --> 04:46.640]  assembly as well. And it took 24 hours. It was covered by Apple care. Um, so I, I was just
[04:46.640 --> 04:50.720]  thought I was lucky, but now apparently there's no generation of Mac book whose keys, uh, I can,
[04:50.720 --> 04:55.680]  I can tolerate. Well, and we have WWDC next week, so you need this thing, right? I mean, this is,
[04:55.680 --> 05:02.800]  do you have like a plan B? Yeah, I still have, um, the review unit they gave us last year for
[05:02.800 --> 05:07.680]  a Mac OS high Sierra, which I haven't used very much. Um, but I might, uh, it's 15 inches,
[05:07.680 --> 05:10.880]  which I don't usually travel with, but I might do that and just bring my Mac book pro with me
[05:11.920 --> 05:16.880]  my iMac pro. Well, I would just use, sorry, I use the iPad pro on the airplane now because
[05:16.880 --> 05:20.320]  the seats have gotten so small. It feels like they're not Mac friendly. No, that's true.
[05:20.320 --> 05:24.960]  It's very true. I can't remember the last time I used to, I guess the only time I sometimes use
[05:24.960 --> 05:32.720]  a Mac on a, on a plane is very specifically the return flight home after an Apple event.
[05:32.720 --> 05:36.720]  If I haven't finished writing about it, that's like the one time, like I don't do any kind of
[05:36.720 --> 05:42.880]  general productivity with the, with a Mac on an airplane. It's just too unwieldy. Even when,
[05:42.880 --> 05:48.000]  even when I get upgraded and I'm in first class, it's, uh, and there's plenty of room. Uh, it's
[05:48.000 --> 05:52.000]  still, it's just ungainly, you know, it's like, you're not, it's not your shorter room, but
[05:52.000 --> 05:56.400]  there's like no good place to put it. It's like you can literally put it on your lap and that's,
[05:56.400 --> 06:02.000]  it's not really a great angle. And then you put it on the tray and it, I feel like I'm a little kid
[06:02.000 --> 06:06.400]  at the lunch table and my arms are up at my shoulders, you know, it's like too high. And
[06:06.400 --> 06:11.360]  the funny thing for me is I'm keyboard agnostic. I can use the iPad pro fine. I do tons of writing
[06:11.360 --> 06:15.840]  on it. I can use the old Mac book keyboard, the new one. I was setting up the, the review unit
[06:15.840 --> 06:19.920]  that I hadn't used in a long time and those keys are just super tight. And then I went back to the
[06:19.920 --> 06:24.240]  2016 one that I've been using for two years. Like all of these butterfly keys feel all loosey goosey
[06:24.240 --> 06:29.280]  now. It's amazing how fast your brain acclimatizes. Oh yeah, I totally, I mean I've, I've never really
[06:29.280 --> 06:33.040]  used the new one. Ben Thompson and I talked about this, I think on the last episode. I've never
[06:33.040 --> 06:37.440]  really used one as my main machine. I've only used review units. My personal Mac book pro is still
[06:37.440 --> 06:43.600]  2014, but even after just a few minutes with the other one, it, this keyboard, I love it because,
[06:43.600 --> 06:47.040]  because I feel it's a hundred percent reliable, but it does feel like the,
[06:48.880 --> 06:52.960]  like the keys are all ready to fall off there. So they both betrayed me now. So I have no safe
[06:52.960 --> 07:00.160]  harbor. All right. But it is, I mean like a lot of people are complaining that you do have to
[07:00.160 --> 07:04.240]  replace the entire top assembly and that's, that's an industry-wide problem. And it's a
[07:04.240 --> 07:08.240]  trans industry problem because Apple made unibodies and they're much better structurally,
[07:08.240 --> 07:12.240]  but they're huge things you have to replace. And your car now has these huge crash panels and
[07:12.240 --> 07:16.240]  crumple zones. If you get a little dent, you've got to replace the entire panel. And as we get
[07:16.240 --> 07:21.680]  better and better at manufacturing stronger and more efficient devices, we lose, we lose the
[07:21.680 --> 07:28.160]  miniature, like the modularity of them. You know, this is, I'll hear from it. And I know that there
[07:28.160 --> 07:34.400]  are people listening to the show who are on the other side of the fence and who are angry if,
[07:34.400 --> 07:39.760]  you know, better to have very strong feelings about the entire industry. But Apple and Apple
[07:39.760 --> 07:48.880]  specifically is move away from modular devices, meaning, you know, the best example, the primary
[07:48.880 --> 07:54.800]  example is room removable batteries, right? I mean, again, it was a topic on my show,
[07:54.800 --> 07:59.040]  one of the most recent episodes, but it's funny the way that it used to be like, it seems so
[07:59.040 --> 08:07.680]  antiquated now, but part of like the pre WWDC trip checklist is make sure both of your MacBook
[08:07.680 --> 08:11.840]  batteries are fully charged, right? Where's that spare? Where's the spare that I haven't used since
[08:11.840 --> 08:16.640]  the last time I went on a big trip? Oh, there it is. What's the charge on that one? You know,
[08:16.640 --> 08:22.160]  and it just seems so ridiculous now. Now it's the external USB C battery, right? But you know,
[08:22.160 --> 08:26.960]  and it's the same, you know, with the phone, it's just, you know, there's just something goes wrong,
[08:26.960 --> 08:31.600]  and usually a lot of it has to be replaced. And I get it, you know, and there's trade offs, you
[08:31.600 --> 08:36.960]  know, there were advantages to being able to just swap out the keyboard without swapping out
[08:36.960 --> 08:40.560]  everything else. But there's also disadvantages. And like you said, you know, the structural
[08:40.560 --> 08:46.960]  integrity of the unibody designs is incredible. Like, you pick up an old, you know, MacBook from
[08:46.960 --> 08:51.760]  1015 years ago, and not only does it feel thick and heavy, but it just feels sort of creaky junk.
[08:51.760 --> 08:56.400]  Yeah, creaky. Exactly. It's like, man, I can't believe that. I can't believe that we tolerated
[08:56.400 --> 09:01.600]  this. We're spending $3500 on these things back then, and they creak. And that's the opportunity
[09:01.600 --> 09:04.960]  cause it's like everybody wants everything, but you can't, everything's a trade off. Apple can
[09:04.960 --> 09:09.200]  design for structural integrity, or they can design for modularity. You can't have both,
[09:09.200 --> 09:14.480]  you got to have trade offs. So I'm on board with that. That's the trend. I see why I, you know,
[09:14.480 --> 09:20.080]  I see that the train left the station years ago. I'm on board with it. But that to me, it's not an
[09:20.080 --> 09:26.640]  argument that Apple should go somehow figure out a way to make a keyboard that can be swapped in
[09:26.640 --> 09:32.080]  if the keyboard goes bad. The argument is, is that they, with this design, the keyboard needs
[09:32.080 --> 09:38.000]  to be more reliable than ever. Right? Like it's not just that this keyboard isn't reliable enough.
[09:38.000 --> 09:43.680]  It's that it really should be given how hard it is to replace and how integrated it is with the
[09:43.680 --> 09:48.400]  whole top piece. It really ought to be more reliable than the previous design. And that
[09:48.400 --> 09:51.920]  was the worst part. Apple insider did a great job with the numbers, but almost nobody actually
[09:51.920 --> 09:56.800]  bothered to read the article. What it's, it didn't say that they were more, uh, there was,
[09:56.800 --> 10:01.760]  so just to back up for a second in every way, the new Mac book pro looks to be way more reliable
[10:01.760 --> 10:06.480]  than previous generations. The number of incidents in their sampling pool were way down in everything
[10:06.480 --> 10:12.880]  except for keyboard in 2016, they were way up in 2017. They looked like they approached 20, uh,
[10:12.880 --> 10:17.040]  2015 levels again, but that's when the rest of the computer got way, way better than the keyboard
[10:17.040 --> 10:22.720]  really didn't. So we're just left to see that maybe it was worse. Maybe they slowly improved it,
[10:22.720 --> 10:26.720]  but it hasn't seen anywhere near the improvements of the rest of the body. Yeah. Uh, the one that I
[10:26.720 --> 10:32.240]  like the most is the hinge. Uh, and when they first came out with these devices, uh, and I
[10:32.240 --> 10:36.480]  had my briefing and like they said, like, this is, you know, we can't put everything in a keynote
[10:36.480 --> 10:40.640]  and there's some things that would sound silly in a keynote, like bragging about the hinge, but that
[10:41.440 --> 10:46.960]  the new hinge compared to like my 2014 a, the biggest difference is that it's so much easier
[10:46.960 --> 10:54.320]  to open the screen without like with just a thumb without the bottom moving and to with like one
[10:54.320 --> 11:00.240]  finger to position it at exactly the angle you want. And it'll stay there, right? Like,
[11:00.240 --> 11:06.880]  so it's easier to move, you know, to, to adjust the angle that it's open, but yet also just as
[11:06.880 --> 11:10.800]  stable in terms of, Oh, it's not going to droop a little bit when you let go. It's, it's truly
[11:10.800 --> 11:15.120]  a fantastic hinge. And I believe it's actually more reliable. I think that's one of the,
[11:15.120 --> 11:19.840]  cause it's a common source of failure. Uh, because you know, there's so much that goes
[11:19.840 --> 11:26.640]  passes between the display and the bottom part. All right. That's it for the keyboard.
[11:28.560 --> 11:33.120]  Here's one, here's a, here's a tip and trick I posted over the weekend. I've avoided this
[11:33.120 --> 11:37.680]  feature my entire life. There's a feature in iOS that you can turn on and, uh, security,
[11:38.400 --> 11:44.160]  you know, in the settings, um, that after 10 failed passcode attempts, wipe the device.
[11:44.160 --> 11:49.440]  And I forget when they added that. I think it was background. I asked for, uh, when they added the
[11:49.440 --> 11:52.880]  hardware encryption, cause they could just throw the keys away. Right. You didn't have to actually
[11:52.880 --> 11:57.360]  wipe the device. Right. It's right. That's the way that works. Is it, you know, everything on your,
[11:57.360 --> 12:07.440]  on your SSD and your phone is encrypted. Um, and rather than sit there and wait for a 256 gigabyte
[12:07.440 --> 12:12.800]  drive to be wiped, they can just throw away the key. And without the key, there's no way it's,
[12:12.800 --> 12:17.520]  it's effectively unreadable. Um, it's pseudo random gibberish to anybody who looks at it.
[12:17.520 --> 12:25.920]  Right. Um, I avoided this feature for the reason that it, it seemed like a good idea and you know,
[12:27.040 --> 12:31.280]  you know, I'm trying to think of what are the hypothetical cases? Like I personally,
[12:31.280 --> 12:36.960]  I'm not really worried about law enforcement. I just, to my knowledge, I have broken any laws
[12:36.960 --> 12:43.200]  other than the speed limit, uh, in a number of years, but it's possible. It's, you know,
[12:43.200 --> 12:49.280]  I don't know, something could happen, you know, uh, uh, and if my phone were taken by, you know,
[12:49.280 --> 12:54.240]  I don't know, TSA agents or something. Even just a thief who wants to not have to bother with
[12:54.240 --> 12:59.680]  activation lock to get into the phone. But the most common scenario for me would be a thief,
[12:59.680 --> 13:04.240]  you know, and you know, it could be something like it falls out of my pocket in a cab and I,
[13:04.240 --> 13:09.040]  I leave it and somebody else picks it up in theory. I don't want to be paranoid, but, uh,
[13:09.840 --> 13:15.360]  you know, I remember when Matt Honan from now at Buzzfeed got targeted as a journalist a couple
[13:15.360 --> 13:19.280]  of years ago and had his iCloud account hacked. And once his iCloud account was hacked because
[13:19.280 --> 13:23.200]  they had access to his email and he used that email for a whole bunch of other services,
[13:23.200 --> 13:28.320]  you know, he got owned in a bunch of ways. It's possible that somebody, you know, WWDC,
[13:28.320 --> 13:32.160]  who knows who I am, could try to take my phone or something like that. Um,
[13:32.160 --> 13:39.360]  yeah. Um, I never turned it on, but then I looked at, I just have been reevaluating my security
[13:39.360 --> 13:46.080]  stuff overall, just sort of a self audit on what do I do? And I'm looking at two factor stuff too,
[13:46.080 --> 13:51.760]  like how do I keep track of those one time codes? Um, but I looked at this feature and I realized
[13:51.760 --> 13:56.800]  that I had misinterpreted it all along ever since until this weekend. I thought that you could,
[13:56.800 --> 14:02.240]  if you turn this on somebody who got your phone like a prankster at a bar, you know,
[14:02.240 --> 14:06.240]  quote unquote friend who just, you know, you leave your phone that they could sit there and enter
[14:06.240 --> 14:09.600]  one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four,
[14:09.600 --> 14:15.360]  10 times and then boom, your phone's erased. Uh, turns out it doesn't work like that at all.
[14:16.320 --> 14:21.600]  And the difference is, well, number one, I asked in a poll on Twitter, which I find fun sometimes,
[14:21.600 --> 14:26.240]  uh, do you enable the feature? And I got, you know, do you use that feature? Um,
[14:27.360 --> 14:34.240]  and out of 4,700 votes plus a bunch of, uh, tweet bot users who just wrote yes or no,
[14:35.120 --> 14:42.320]  no problem. Uh, but it seemed to run like this almost exactly. It was 34% and 66%. So exactly
[14:42.320 --> 14:48.080]  one third, two third, one third enable it to third don't. And the number one reason people gave for
[14:48.080 --> 14:53.760]  not is no, I have kids. They don't want their kid, you know, you're sleeping, kid comes into bedroom,
[14:53.760 --> 14:56.960]  picks up your phone, starts playing with it, trying to unlock it. And then all of a sudden
[14:56.960 --> 15:01.280]  your phone's erased. Well, here's the thing that this feature is so much more clever than I had
[15:01.280 --> 15:08.800]  thought. And I shouldn't be surprised. Um, you get five free free attempts at, at your passcode
[15:08.800 --> 15:13.920]  five as fast as you can enter them. But after that fifth failed one, you're putting a one minute
[15:13.920 --> 15:18.960]  timeout where the only thing you can do with your phone is make a 911 call. And if the sixth one
[15:18.960 --> 15:26.080]  fails, you go to a five minute timeout. And if, if that one fails, you go to a 15 minute timeout.
[15:26.080 --> 15:30.960]  And I think it, I didn't, I didn't press my luck further than that, but apparently it,
[15:30.960 --> 15:35.280]  the timeouts escalate to the point where no matter how long you wait between tries,
[15:35.280 --> 15:42.160]  it takes at least three and a half hours to get to enter the 10th one. Um, which it's,
[15:42.160 --> 15:46.480]  once I realized that I was like, I turned it on instantly on every iOS device I have,
[15:46.480 --> 15:53.200]  because I cannot imagine a scenario where the phone is out of my hands for an, you know,
[15:53.200 --> 15:58.320]  without my knowledge for three and a half hours and, and where I wouldn't want this feature
[15:58.320 --> 16:03.200]  enabled. Yes. No, I mean, it's, there's a classic debate and I have to credit, uh, Dave Naney and
[16:03.200 --> 16:07.200]  super duper for opening my eyes to it. I was all about everything has to be encrypted. Everything
[16:07.200 --> 16:10.960]  has to be safe. Everything has to be secure. And when I was talking to him for an article,
[16:10.960 --> 16:16.640]  he said, well, no, because in a lot of cases you don't want fail secure. You want fail safe.
[16:16.640 --> 16:21.840]  There are circumstances where your worst nightmare is information being stolen from you. But in other
[16:21.840 --> 16:26.480]  situations, your worst nightmare is you losing access to that information. And it's why some
[16:26.480 --> 16:30.480]  people will never encrypt backup drives because if those have your wedding photos or the photos
[16:30.480 --> 16:35.120]  of your children being born, you cannot do disc recovery on an encrypted, on an encrypted drive.
[16:35.120 --> 16:38.800]  So if somebody else deals those photos, yeah, they have your photos, but if you lose them,
[16:38.800 --> 16:42.480]  you're getting divorced. Like there's just no, no way to come back from that. And, and this to me,
[16:42.480 --> 16:46.080]  I think people were worried that they would lose their data. Someone like their kid would type it
[16:46.080 --> 16:49.840]  in, but this is really a case where you can have that security. You're not, you're not risking the
[16:49.840 --> 16:54.080]  deletion of your information. One of my favorite tips along those lines. And I remember when I
[16:54.080 --> 17:01.680]  first read it, I was just like, no, uh, but it was because it was from somebody who I trust
[17:01.680 --> 17:08.560]  implicitly, Bruce Schneier, security expert, great writer. Um, but he wrote a couple of years back
[17:08.560 --> 17:14.400]  and he's referenced it since that for a lot of typical users, a great way to keep track of your
[17:14.400 --> 17:19.760]  passwords, especially important ones, is to write them down on a piece of paper. Uh, and you think
[17:19.760 --> 17:24.800]  like, no, that sounds absurd, right? But they're like, but his explanation, it makes sense is that
[17:25.600 --> 17:31.520]  people have been good at keeping physical objects, important physical objects, secure,
[17:32.080 --> 17:38.480]  and in a known location forever. Like we're kind of hooked up evolutionarily to be able to keep
[17:38.480 --> 17:45.520]  a physical object safe. It's the digital stuff that, that we can make goofy, absent-minded
[17:45.520 --> 17:51.280]  mistakes or be tricked into fishing or something like that. Um, but like if, you know, you keep
[17:51.280 --> 17:55.760]  your passport safe, why not keep a paper, you know, a piece of paper with your most important
[17:55.760 --> 18:01.760]  passwords wherever you keep your passport. Uh, it's probably way safer than any digitals and,
[18:01.760 --> 18:06.640]  and less likely to be victimized by fishing or something than anything you could do digitally.
[18:06.640 --> 18:11.360]  And this is also part of when you listen to, you know, Apple's rationale for why they stay
[18:11.360 --> 18:16.160]  in countries like China or the data repatriation thing. You know, France wants citizens data to be
[18:16.160 --> 18:20.320]  local to that country. And you can understand this on a, on a global scale. And some countries
[18:20.320 --> 18:24.640]  we happen to like better than others, or we are less afraid of than others, but no one really
[18:24.640 --> 18:28.160]  likes the idea of a foreign government having ownership of their data. But one of the things
[18:28.160 --> 18:32.400]  that big companies have to factor in is for an average citizen, even in China, even in the EU,
[18:32.400 --> 18:37.120]  even in North America, South America, whatever, some of them care less about security than they
[18:37.120 --> 18:42.800]  do about backup. And them keeping access to iCloud photo library, as silly as it sounds,
[18:42.800 --> 18:48.080]  is, is so much more important to them than them having access to a VPN app. And they have to
[18:48.080 --> 18:53.200]  balance the interests of a very large customer base. Totally true. All right, let me take a
[18:53.200 --> 18:58.400]  break here and thank our first sponsor. It is one of my favorite sponsors. What a fabulous product
[18:58.400 --> 19:08.720]  these people sell away away makes suitcases really travel bags and accessories. And they're just
[19:08.720 --> 19:13.280]  fantastic. They use high quality materials and have a much lower price compared to other brands,
[19:13.280 --> 19:17.760]  because they're one of these, you know, internet companies, you know, typical podcast advertisers,
[19:17.760 --> 19:22.400]  they sell direct, they make them, they make these things themselves, they design them themselves,
[19:22.400 --> 19:26.240]  and they sell them direct to you. So there's no retail markup, like you get when you buy a
[19:26.240 --> 19:33.520]  suitcase at a retail store. Truly, truly low prices for really high quality suitcase. They
[19:33.520 --> 19:41.200]  have over 10 colors and five sizes. The sizes are the most aptly named sizes I could imagine.
[19:41.200 --> 19:46.480]  They're called the carry on the bigger carry on the medium, the large, and the kids carry on.
[19:47.680 --> 19:52.560]  You know exactly how big these things are just from the names, right? All their suitcases are
[19:52.560 --> 19:57.520]  made with premium German polycarbonate. That's very lightweight. I can verify this and bends
[19:57.520 --> 20:03.120]  but never breaks the interior features a patent pending compression system useful for overpackers.
[20:03.120 --> 20:06.800]  This is one of my favorite features about this suitcase because my previous carry on
[20:06.800 --> 20:12.720]  was effectively just a big rectangle and I had it for years and years and years. I mean, maybe close
[20:12.720 --> 20:19.680]  to 20 years. But you just opened it up and it's just a big rectangle of volume. And I would just
[20:19.680 --> 20:24.160]  stuff everything in there. The little features that it's not a lot, it's not complicated,
[20:24.160 --> 20:30.160]  but the couple of features they have in here, like a little panel that you can secure down
[20:30.160 --> 20:35.520]  with a belt keeps your shirts from getting wrinkled up. They have a little bag that's
[20:35.520 --> 20:40.400]  perfect for storing your dirty clothes. So you your dirty clothes aren't getting mixed in with
[20:40.400 --> 20:46.640]  clean. It's really great. It's a really great system. They've got four 360 degrees spinner
[20:46.640 --> 20:51.600]  wheels. They're great wheels. Really, I've had this bag. If you can, if you're a longtime listener,
[20:51.600 --> 20:55.440]  you know that away has been sponsoring this show for a while. And they sent me one of these
[20:55.440 --> 21:00.400]  suitcases back when I first started sponsoring and the thing still looks brand new. It looks like I
[21:00.400 --> 21:04.400]  could take it back. Honest to God, it looks like I could take it back and get a refund. It's in such
[21:04.400 --> 21:08.720]  great shape. And that's not like I baby it. But the wheels are as good as they were on the first
[21:08.720 --> 21:17.120]  day. It's really great. And the other thing is the carry ons come with a built in battery that you
[21:17.120 --> 21:23.280]  can use as USB ports and you can use it to charge whatever anything that charges over USB. And I
[21:23.280 --> 21:28.080]  know that there's some rules on certain airlines now about these built in batteries, you can take
[21:28.080 --> 21:31.600]  it out very easily. So if you're flying somewhere and they're like, you know, you got to take the
[21:31.600 --> 21:35.280]  battery out, you can just take it out. It's not a problem. It's not like you can't take your suitcase
[21:35.280 --> 21:39.840]  on the plane because you have a battery. It comes right out. But it's just such a convenient thing.
[21:39.840 --> 21:45.360]  So it's like every seat in the airport now has for me has a charger because I've got my bag with me.
[21:45.360 --> 21:48.720]  You don't have to hunt around for the seats that happened to be near an outlet or something like
[21:48.720 --> 21:54.960]  that. Anyway, they have 100 day free trial. So buy it, use it for three months. And if you don't
[21:54.960 --> 22:02.560]  like it, you can get a refund. No reason to worry about it. And they have free shipping on any order
[22:02.560 --> 22:10.240]  within the contiguous US. So sorry, Alaska. Anyway, it's a great product. I use it. I'll be
[22:10.240 --> 22:17.120]  packing it for WWDC over the weekend. Wouldn't want to travel without it. It's really great bag,
[22:17.120 --> 22:20.560]  very lightweight, great wheels, everything like that. Here's the deal for listeners of the show.

[22:40.640 --> 22:44.000]  Next on the list. We got to keep going. We got so much so much.
[22:46.880 --> 22:53.760]  Do you know why we're talking about security? There's these apps. One of the things that I've
[22:53.760 --> 22:59.520]  done, I just isn't even on the notes. But one of the things that I've been convinced of is that
[22:59.520 --> 23:07.840]  using your phone number as a second factor in two factor off, meaning, you know, you say, Oh,
[23:07.840 --> 23:13.280]  I'll use two factor with this service, and I'll enter my name, my password, and then it'll send
[23:13.280 --> 23:21.920]  me an SMS message with a code and I can enter the code. It's better than not having two factor,
[23:21.920 --> 23:28.320]  but SMS, I've been convinced is not something you should rely upon because of how many times
[23:28.320 --> 23:37.120]  I've seen stories of people, their carrier getting social engineered effectively. So somebody who
[23:37.120 --> 23:42.960]  wants to steal Renee Ritchie's, you know, Dropbox account, and they know your phone number, they
[23:42.960 --> 23:48.640]  could call your carrier and say, Hey, this is Renee Ritchie. Is it my phone number? I need to, you
[23:48.640 --> 23:53.120]  know, I need to get a new SIM because I got this new phone, you know, whatever, you know, and you'd
[23:53.120 --> 23:59.200]  think that shouldn't work. But and I don't think it's easy. I don't think it always works. But I've
[23:59.200 --> 24:03.120]  read enough horror stories that it's not trustworthy. Well, I'll go a step further. I mean,
[24:03.120 --> 24:06.880]  I refuse to use that because I've heard stories about people who are traveling and you know,
[24:06.880 --> 24:10.880]  they have their tickets on their phone, they present it and the custom person will just seize
[24:10.880 --> 24:15.440]  the phone and then they see two factor, they can type in a request for it, get it on the phone and
[24:15.440 --> 24:20.880]  get into your account. So it's I just don't think it's secure at all. It's out of band, but it
[24:20.880 --> 24:28.560]  doesn't add any security to your device. Yeah, that's interesting. And it's also the case I,
[24:28.560 --> 24:33.760]  you know, and it's rare. I mean, it's, it's, you know, this is not something you want to optimize
[24:33.760 --> 24:41.440]  for. But it is an issue is you're in an airplane, or you're overseas, where you're just on Wi Fi,
[24:41.440 --> 24:48.160]  so you don't have to incur roaming fees. And you've got Wi Fi, but you can't get an SMS,
[24:48.800 --> 24:55.120]  right? It's because you can't get a phone call up in the air. Just not great. So I've tried to get
[24:55.120 --> 25:02.400]  rid of my phone number as a second factor on any service that will let me including Google. Like
[25:02.400 --> 25:07.600]  my Google accounts, I have a few but my Google accounts, none of them know my phone number
[25:07.600 --> 25:15.280]  anymore. I don't use my phone for anything related to my accounts if I can. But then what do you use
[25:15.280 --> 25:23.680]  for a second factor? Well, Apple uses Apple lets you not think about it, because Apple uses just
[25:23.680 --> 25:27.600]  the devices themselves, right? The assumption is if you have more than one Apple device,
[25:27.600 --> 25:34.160]  and you can say that you trust one, it will send push notifications. You may know people out there
[25:34.160 --> 25:39.440]  may not even realize they're not using SMS for this, that it's just sort of a magic right to
[25:39.440 --> 25:43.760]  your device. You know, if your phone's your trusted device, and you're setting up a new iPad,
[25:43.760 --> 25:49.600]  and you're logging into iCloud, it'll send a push notification to, you know, your other trusted
[25:49.600 --> 25:54.400]  devices, you might get the same thing on your Mac and your phone, but then you answer it on one,
[25:54.400 --> 25:59.360]  put the code in, and then it's all good. And then the new devices added to your list of trusted
[25:59.360 --> 26:04.320]  devices. That's not going to, you know, that's something Apple can do. And I think they've done
[26:04.320 --> 26:09.440]  a great job. And it's sort of unheralded, but it wouldn't work for, you know, somebody like
[26:09.440 --> 26:14.800]  Dropbox or something like that. So what you can do, and again, I'm not an expert on this,
[26:14.800 --> 26:19.840]  but they have these these things. I forget the name of the protocol. It's like tot something,
[26:19.840 --> 26:24.880]  but effectively, it's it's a way it's a standardized way to get one time
[26:24.880 --> 26:30.400]  expiring passwords that only last for like 30 seconds. Google has an app called Google
[26:30.400 --> 26:35.280]  authenticator. Have you ever used that? I used to I use off, you know, that's right. And that
[26:35.280 --> 26:41.360]  was what I'm switching to. That's exactly great minds think alike. So, but they generate the same
[26:41.360 --> 26:47.200]  type of codes. They're six digit numbers, they only last for 30 seconds. And then the apps,
[26:47.200 --> 26:53.760]  all the apps I've tried to show you like so if you have, you know, whatever your name is at gmail.com,
[26:53.760 --> 27:01.200]  you open up the app, and it'll say whatever your name at gmail.com. And it might say, you know,
[27:01.200 --> 27:07.280]  729123. But it'll tell you that it's got 20 seconds left. So if it you know, says it only
[27:07.280 --> 27:11.440]  has three seconds left, just wait, you know, three seconds, it'll give you the new one for
[27:11.440 --> 27:18.560]  the next 30 seconds, then enter it in. And you're in what I've been used. So I've been using Google
[27:18.560 --> 27:25.040]  authenticator for this for about a year. And as part of my reevaluating my security stuff, the
[27:25.040 --> 27:29.920]  one thing that's annoying that's annoys me about it is that it's Google authenticator is tied to
[27:29.920 --> 27:37.760]  one phone. Yeah. So like I have it on my iPhone. But then when I get a new iPhone, it's like I have
[27:37.760 --> 27:45.120]  to kind of be careful because I don't want to wipe the old phone until I've set up the new phone and
[27:45.120 --> 27:50.240]  use the old phone to get the Google authenticator codes, because they're only being generated on
[27:50.240 --> 27:58.160]  that one device. And it if I lost the phone, if somebody stole it, if it broke, if I dropped it,
[27:58.160 --> 28:03.600]  and it just shattered, somebody steals it, whatever. You're not locked out of your accounts.
[28:03.600 --> 28:08.400]  There's, you know, recovery codes that you can print. And again, like the thing I just said,
[28:08.400 --> 28:14.160]  like keep them in a secure location. There's ways to recover, but there's no easy way to get right
[28:14.160 --> 28:19.280]  in. Yeah. Wouldn't it be better if you could get it from any device? And that's what authi does.
[28:19.280 --> 28:26.800]  authi syncs these things. So you can install the authi app, A U T H Y. And then you could have,
[28:26.800 --> 28:29.840]  you know, you're going to get this in, you can get the same codes on multiple devices.
[28:30.480 --> 28:35.600]  So I'm in the midst of moving everything from Google authenticator to authi. For that reason,
[28:35.600 --> 28:40.960]  I use one password for passwords, and they now have two factor built into them. They didn't
[28:40.960 --> 28:45.440]  at the time. So I just got started with authi. And I stayed that way, because I don't, I like
[28:45.440 --> 28:49.680]  having a separate app for that. Yeah, well, I know a couple of people, Ben Thompson, in particular,
[28:49.680 --> 28:54.000]  he uses one password, and he uses authi for the one time fee. He's the one who kind of pushed me
[28:54.000 --> 28:59.360]  towards this. And his explanation is exactly what he's just, it maybe it's not even logical,
[28:59.360 --> 29:06.080]  but he just doesn't want to have the password and the second factor in the same app. You know,
[29:06.080 --> 29:11.600]  like it somehow feels more compartmentalized to have your password and one password and have your
[29:11.600 --> 29:17.040]  you know, one time authentication code in a separate app. I looked at one I don't use one
[29:17.040 --> 29:25.440]  password for my passwords. I just use the keychain. Yeah. But I looked at one password as a as a rival
[29:25.440 --> 29:31.680]  to authi because I could have it on my phone and my Mac and get you know, do the just use it for
[29:31.680 --> 29:37.840]  these one time keys. And it's a great app. I could see why people like it. But it doesn't make sense
[29:37.840 --> 29:42.240]  to use it only, in my opinion, to use it only for the one time things like you're either buying into
[29:42.240 --> 29:48.640]  the one password lifestyle and putting everything in one password, or it's overkill. So for me,
[29:48.640 --> 29:54.000]  I didn't I like the idea of iCloud keychain. But until iPhone 10 and face ID, they never put any
[29:54.000 --> 29:59.280]  sort of security intercept between the device and the password. So let's just say you know,
[29:59.280 --> 30:02.400]  someone's lost and they want to use your phone or you're at a conference and someone wants to show
[30:02.400 --> 30:07.200]  you a website, you hand them their your phone and they have immediate access to your passwords and
[30:07.200 --> 30:12.240]  your credit cards. Where was something like one password or you know, LastPass or Dashlane,
[30:12.240 --> 30:17.120]  all those things, they'd have to enter in another password or use touch ID or face ID to get it. But
[30:17.120 --> 30:21.440]  now with iPhone 10 and the face ID thing, if it had launched like that, if it had launched with
[30:21.440 --> 30:25.840]  touch ID support, I would probably gone all in on it. Well, I get away from that because I don't
[30:25.840 --> 30:34.960]  let anybody use my phone. That's fair. Not really a problem. But anyway, off the I recommend it. So
[30:34.960 --> 30:40.000]  my takeaway from this segment of the show is if you're using SMS as a second factor on various
[30:40.000 --> 30:45.600]  services, I say look into taking an afternoon cleaning this up, get rid of SMS as your second
[30:45.600 --> 30:52.160]  factor. There's also just the fact that SMS isn't encrypted. And again, what you know, what are the
[30:52.160 --> 31:00.080]  Russian is the Russian spy agency going to come in and put a tap on the line and intercept this
[31:00.080 --> 31:06.480]  unencrypted SMS? I really doubt it if and you know, I but still, it is unencrypted. It just
[31:06.480 --> 31:14.880]  seems it just seems wrong in principle to use an unencrypted protocol to send something that should
[31:14.880 --> 31:20.480]  be definitely being totally and we're living in a in a time when we have vast data storage
[31:20.480 --> 31:25.760]  capabilities. And it seems like organizations just collect this data and sit on it. And you never
[31:25.760 --> 31:29.840]  like, no one's doing anything criminal here. But you never know when something's going to happen,
[31:29.840 --> 31:34.000]  an accident will happen, or a lawsuit or a criminal prosecution will ensue. And they'll
[31:34.000 --> 31:37.520]  be able to go backwards in time and just look at all the data they collected on you and find
[31:37.520 --> 31:41.440]  something to support whatever they want to get you on. And I don't even want to risk that. Right.
[31:42.960 --> 31:49.200]  All right, next topic. Oh, anyway, so take away get rid of SMS as a factor and look into off the
[31:49.200 --> 31:56.640]  if you're looking for a client to sync these things. I suppose there's some mild security
[31:56.640 --> 32:01.120]  trade off between the way that authy syncs these things. Now what they sync to the server is
[32:01.120 --> 32:06.480]  encrypted. So it there's nothing on authy server, it's end to end encrypted. So it's not like your
[32:06.480 --> 32:12.800]  code, somebody can log into your authy account and see your codes. You know, or if their server
[32:12.800 --> 32:18.480]  was compromised, that your codes would be exposed. I suppose there's some kind of security advantage
[32:18.480 --> 32:23.520]  to Google authenticators only on one device thing. But the convenient it's just so inconvenient when
[32:23.520 --> 32:27.600]  that's the device you're looking to replace, especially if you lose it, then you're done,
[32:27.600 --> 32:35.280]  especially if you lose it. Right. Anyway, next topic. Got to get this out. I don't think I
[32:35.280 --> 32:39.200]  talked about it. I think this whole thing erupted in between the last show and this show. I've had
[32:39.200 --> 32:44.800]  a bit of a bit of a gap in the programming schedule. But this whole thing with Google,
[32:44.800 --> 32:50.480]  Google's duplex demo on stage at IO, which I raised some questions about,
[32:50.480 --> 32:54.880]  and even thought about it until you said it. I was just all I was all hooked right in.
[32:54.880 --> 33:01.520]  I it took me a day, the first day I watched and it was in my opinion, I know that there
[33:01.520 --> 33:07.120]  for Android, you know, IO is Google's version of WWDC. And there's two types of news. There's,
[33:07.120 --> 33:15.520]  you know, it to use two very broad buckets. There's general purpose news of interest to anybody who
[33:15.520 --> 33:20.480]  uses the platform. And then there's developer news. And so the developer news for Android is
[33:20.480 --> 33:26.640]  a bit outside my wheelhouse. Like I don't know how big a deal the new Android and Chrome OS
[33:26.640 --> 33:33.440]  features are app slices. But in terms of stuff that broke through out of, you know, developer
[33:33.440 --> 33:38.320]  news into mainstream news, I don't think there's any question that this duplex demo was the one
[33:38.320 --> 33:46.560]  that got the most attention. It for two reasons, it seemed like just the fact that it supposedly
[33:46.560 --> 33:53.200]  worked that you could say, you know, hey, dingus, call, whatever hair salon and try to get me an
[33:53.200 --> 33:59.200]  appointment Wednesday afternoon. And that it would actually place a phone call and have this
[33:59.200 --> 34:04.800]  interaction and make a phone call according to the recordings they played. That's interesting enough
[34:04.800 --> 34:12.000]  because that's a serious break. That would be a serious breakthrough in this voice-driven
[34:12.000 --> 34:17.360]  assistant stuff. Like nobody has anything that does that right now. That's a breakthrough.
[34:17.360 --> 34:26.240]  And then the second factor is the vocal intonations where the assistant was doing
[34:26.240 --> 34:35.760]  these umms and, you know, these verbal ticks that gave it a life rather uncanny life likeness,
[34:35.760 --> 34:40.880]  like, and you could hear gasps from the audience. And I think that's why it was so engaging.
[34:40.880 --> 34:47.840]  And I realized and day one, the, you know, the takes were, wow, Google has this amazing
[34:47.840 --> 34:53.520]  voice assistant that can make phone calls and it sounds human. And immediate 15 minutes later,
[34:53.520 --> 34:58.320]  followed up by, wow, this thing is really creepy, you know? Yes. Right. And
[35:00.480 --> 35:05.680]  I get that take the, Hey, this is creepy. We shouldn't is, you know, some people were
[35:05.680 --> 35:12.080]  outright. Some people just reasonably, just reasonably asking it. Is it ethically? Is it
[35:12.080 --> 35:19.920]  ethical to create an AI that would trick the receptionist? It tries to masquerade as human.
[35:19.920 --> 35:24.640]  Right. But is that ethical? I don't think it's, I don't know.
[35:25.360 --> 35:29.440]  And also, but it's such a nuanced argument because for a normal person using it,
[35:29.440 --> 35:33.600]  maybe it isn't. But if you have, if you're have accessibility issues, like you don't speak the
[35:33.600 --> 35:37.200]  language or you have a speech impediment or you're mute, is it ethical to force someone
[35:37.200 --> 35:42.320]  to disclose that they're using an assistant? And what is the difference? What is the difference
[35:42.320 --> 35:50.480]  between using it as an accessibility thing? You know, to me that those ethical questions are not
[35:50.480 --> 35:57.280]  clear cut, you know, but it's, and you know, we're running right up to questions that science
[35:57.280 --> 36:03.200]  fiction writers have been dealing with since the dawn of science fiction. I think that's what was
[36:03.200 --> 36:06.800]  off putting about, at least for me, what was off putting about the discussion is that Google
[36:06.800 --> 36:10.720]  was sort of treating it as cocky. What look at we can do with technology and they didn't exhibit
[36:10.720 --> 36:15.760]  any humanness, any respect, any, it didn't give us any idea that they understood the responsibility
[36:15.760 --> 36:19.280]  of what they were doing. Right. It seems very clear to me that they hadn't really thought
[36:19.280 --> 36:28.560]  about that. Yeah. And, and again, even if the conclusion is that a service like this
[36:28.560 --> 36:34.560]  shouldn't masquerade as human without at least disclosing it upfront, like this is a call from
[36:34.560 --> 36:38.720]  the Google, your Google assistant, you know, I'm working on behalf of a client or some, you know,
[36:38.720 --> 36:46.320]  whatever preface they would say to make clear that this is what's going on. In the aftermath of that
[36:46.320 --> 36:49.280]  ethical criticism, Google came out with the statement that, oh, yeah, yeah, we're going to
[36:49.280 --> 36:53.360]  have it. We're going to have it to disclose itself. But if they were thinking of that,
[36:53.360 --> 36:58.320]  why would they have added all of these ums and ahs that make it sound human? Right. And if you
[36:58.320 --> 37:02.640]  had any basic, like even basic PR, anyone who's doing a keynote, you go through objection handling,
[37:02.640 --> 37:06.640]  you go segment by segment, and you realize what the reaction will be to each segment as you try
[37:06.640 --> 37:11.280]  to get the best language possible. So either they were completely inept and didn't think about it,
[37:11.280 --> 37:17.840]  or they didn't care. Yeah, I don't know. But put all that aside, put the ethical questions aside.
[37:18.400 --> 37:26.080]  It is damn cool, if it works as they're recording shows, which I do believe, as time goes on,
[37:26.080 --> 37:32.160]  is a bigger and bigger if, but put it aside as to whether it should do that. And maybe it shouldn't.
[37:32.160 --> 37:39.120]  But if the fact that they could do it is amazing, it really is the stuff of science fiction. I mean,
[37:39.120 --> 37:46.320]  it is one of the most fundamental technologies of our time. Yeah, it's really a very cool thing,
[37:46.320 --> 37:52.560]  if it works. Well, just to add to add further to like, to this whole issue, what happens if
[37:52.560 --> 37:55.920]  something goes wrong, like you're calling to make a hair appointment. I spoke about this with Steve
[37:55.920 --> 38:00.560]  Aquino on his show. And all of a sudden, it books you a perm and a blonde dye job. And that's not
[38:00.560 --> 38:03.920]  what you want. And should it just at that point, when it's failing, does it have to tell you it's
[38:03.920 --> 38:09.120]  not human? Right? Or, you know, I don't know, I just imagine there's so many ways that it could
[38:09.120 --> 38:15.440]  fail. But anyway, the next day, I don't know what made me go back to it. But I was like, you know,
[38:15.440 --> 38:19.200]  sometimes that's how I start the day is I just review what the hell did I write about yesterday.
[38:20.480 --> 38:24.000]  And I thought about it. And I watched that segment of the keynote again.
[38:24.000 --> 38:31.040]  And my spidey sense just went nuts, like, as I studied it the second time and stopped wasn't,
[38:31.040 --> 38:36.160]  you know, no longer was wowed by the humaneness of the thing. I just actually listened to the
[38:36.160 --> 38:42.640]  details of the call. And I thought, and the fact that that Sundar Pichai said, these are,
[38:42.640 --> 38:48.400]  this is a real actual call to an actual hair salon that, you know, he emphasized it multiple times
[38:48.400 --> 38:54.720]  that this is these are real calls. And they were just so many red flags to me, like the way that
[38:54.720 --> 39:02.320]  they didn't answer the phone with the name of the establishment. Like the fact that, like, I,
[39:03.200 --> 39:07.360]  you know, I don't I haven't done a survey of 100 hair salons. But I, you know, there's places that
[39:07.360 --> 39:11.280]  you can just walk into without an appointment. And then there's places where you need an appointment.
[39:11.280 --> 39:15.680]  And when you book an appointment, they usually ask, like, you know, if there's a particular
[39:15.680 --> 39:19.840]  stylist, who you want, you know, like your reg, if you're a regular customer, or something like that,
[39:21.600 --> 39:26.800]  you know, and I'm sure you could say, I'll just take whoever's available, you know, at one o'clock
[39:26.800 --> 39:33.920]  on Wednesday. But that that that just wasn't brought up in the call, you know, and I just and
[39:33.920 --> 39:39.600]  then I there was a CNET store, I forget who wrote it, but somebody at CNET got access to this a
[39:39.600 --> 39:46.960]  couple of days before IO, which is, you know, a very typical PR move for tech companies. Apple,
[39:47.920 --> 39:54.160]  to my knowledge, doesn't do it before keynotes, because they're so super secretive about keynotes.
[39:54.880 --> 40:00.960]  But they, they, you know, but that they'll have a wired piece or some, some big magazine thing.
[40:01.920 --> 40:09.120]  But you know, like, Matthew Panzorino recently got just single, just Matthew got access to
[40:09.120 --> 40:15.280]  access to what was it that he got access to the Mac Pro. That's right, that's right. And
[40:15.280 --> 40:24.400]  infinity where the man is intolerable. The Mac Pro and the Mac Pro team, and the Pro Tools team
[40:24.400 --> 40:30.480]  that has, you know, and he got this scoop on how they've hired actual professional music producers,
[40:31.040 --> 40:37.760]  and film editors, and are have hired them as contractors to just work right across the hall
[40:37.760 --> 40:44.240]  from like the Final Cut Pro team and logic team, and to when they run into a problem to be able to
[40:44.240 --> 40:49.200]  just grab, you know, like an engineer or one of the managers or somebody and say, here, here,
[40:49.200 --> 40:54.880]  this annoys me, like, I click this button, I click this menu, and it every time it takes, you know,
[40:54.880 --> 40:59.520]  eight seconds for the menu to finish filling in and I click this, I click this menu 30 times a
[40:59.520 --> 41:04.080]  day. You know, that was like an actual example that they came up with. And then they figured out
[41:04.080 --> 41:07.840]  what the bottleneck is. And then all of a sudden, they made it so the menu just opens instantly.
[41:09.600 --> 41:14.160]  You know, companies do this, though, they'll they'll seed an exclusive to somebody. So this
[41:14.160 --> 41:20.960]  guy for CNET got an exclusive on duplex a couple of days before IO, but all he got to do was hear
[41:20.960 --> 41:27.440]  recordings, he didn't get to hear a live call happen. Just really, it just seems very strange
[41:27.440 --> 41:32.160]  to me. And I realized, I mean, it's like, I don't know if you saw my the Twitter debate on this.
[41:32.160 --> 41:42.080]  Yes. But it was so bifurcated between people who are like, Hmm, you're right, this is a little
[41:42.080 --> 41:47.200]  fishy. I wonder what's going on. And the people who are like, you're nuts. You know, the thing
[41:47.200 --> 41:53.840]  that the comparison that kept coming up was that I had gone full birther. Well, that's a reference
[41:53.840 --> 41:59.840]  to the birthers are the people who think Barack Obama was not born in the United States people
[41:59.840 --> 42:04.880]  know that the you know, but that the people who insisted that he had to show a birth certificate
[42:04.880 --> 42:10.480]  to prove that he wasn't born in Kenya or whatever. Despite all the at the Apple events, they go out
[42:10.480 --> 42:14.400]  of their like, if they showed you face ID on stage, they have working examples backstage,
[42:14.400 --> 42:17.280]  and people explain how they work and walk you through it. And you see live,
[42:17.280 --> 42:20.640]  even if you don't get to do it yourself all the time, you get to see it done yourself.
[42:20.640 --> 42:26.880]  Right. You know, and, and, again, I wasn't comparing it to Apple at all. It's just, I guess,
[42:26.880 --> 42:31.520]  because that's what I typically write about. Everybody makes it about Apple, especially the
[42:31.520 --> 42:38.000]  Google or Googly type people who read my stuff. But they're like readers. Well, what, you know,
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.720]  what about HomePod? HomePod? You know, where's the to HomePod support? Well, which is actually
[42:42.720 --> 42:47.040]  out to see that at WWDC. They walked us in the back and they showed. Right. We got to hear it
[42:47.040 --> 42:54.880]  at WWDC. And even when HomePod first shipped earlier this year, at the product briefings,
[42:54.880 --> 43:00.320]  you know, and, you know, it famously AirPlay 2 didn't ship until literally yesterday. Yeah,
[43:00.320 --> 43:06.400]  I think right. It's been a long week. It's been a long week. Yes. So yes, HomePod shipped and
[43:06.400 --> 43:12.800]  spent months on the market without any of the AirPlay 2 features, which include pairing two
[43:12.800 --> 43:18.320]  of them in stereo, or pairing multiple ones throughout a home to play the same music
[43:18.320 --> 43:24.000]  simultaneously in multiple named rooms, you know, and being able to tell your dingus to
[43:24.000 --> 43:29.360]  move this song to the dining room or whatever. None of those features shipped with HomePod
[43:29.360 --> 43:36.320]  because AirPlay 2 didn't ship. But at the briefing when HomePod shipped, I, you know,
[43:36.320 --> 43:44.480]  and I think you did too, got to, you know, see ones running obviously beta software, but like
[43:44.480 --> 43:50.160]  paired in stereo or in multiple rooms, and, you know, could see it in action and could tell Siri
[43:50.160 --> 43:55.520]  to play a certain song and it all worked. You know, I mean, again, it wasn't shipping. Nobody
[43:55.520 --> 44:00.080]  said it was shipping. Everybody said this is coming. But there were, you know, everybody who
[44:00.080 --> 44:06.240]  was everybody in the media who got a briefing got to see that it actually does work. Right.
[44:07.760 --> 44:12.880]  It's very strange not to play a recording and not have a demo. And again, there are certain
[44:12.880 --> 44:19.040]  types of demos that don't scale. So a perfect example is self-driving car. They can't bring
[44:19.040 --> 44:25.200]  a self-driving car on stage at I.O. and have the car drive around. I mean, I guess I could
[44:25.200 --> 44:29.120]  have it move forward six inches or something, but, you know, you can't do like a road test
[44:29.760 --> 44:36.560]  for an audience of four thousand I.O. attendees like that. You know, that's why the trusted people
[44:36.560 --> 44:43.520]  in the media exist, that somebody who writes, you know, for whatever website and you know them,
[44:43.520 --> 44:48.160]  they have a body of work behind them and they say, I got invited to Google's test track or
[44:48.160 --> 44:53.520]  whoever's test track. And I got to see this car and it did this and it did that. And I was in the
[44:53.520 --> 44:58.240]  back seat. And, you know, this is what happened. You know, you take that's that's why the media
[44:58.240 --> 45:02.000]  are there. You don't just take the company's word for it. But somebody gets a demo and gets to
[45:02.000 --> 45:08.080]  report on how it went. This duplex thing, nobody did it, you know, and there's still to this day,
[45:08.080 --> 45:13.600]  as of May 30th, to my knowledge, that there's still not one person in the media who has seen
[45:13.600 --> 45:20.880]  and seen or heard a duplex call take place live, which really makes me think that something really,
[45:22.480 --> 45:27.600]  really screwed up. A number of mistakes were made in between. Let's put this in the I.O.
[45:27.600 --> 45:32.960]  keynote and here's what Sundar is actually going to say there. I think there were a number of
[45:32.960 --> 45:41.200]  mistakes. My guess is that it doesn't sound nearly as good as the recordings they played,
[45:41.200 --> 45:50.000]  I either longer pauses between segments, either more awkward inability to parse certain questions
[45:50.000 --> 45:54.400]  like, do you have a particular stylist in mind or something like that? And I wouldn't even be
[45:54.400 --> 45:59.760]  surprised if the human like audio, you know, voice quality doesn't sound like the recordings
[46:00.320 --> 46:06.320]  that this was sort of these recordings were sort of idealized versions of what they're trying to
[46:06.320 --> 46:13.520]  build. And somehow between making them and then Sundar getting up on stage, it turned into these
[46:13.520 --> 46:18.960]  are actual calls. And once they realize this and, you know, about the only one raising questions,
[46:18.960 --> 46:24.000]  there was a great story at Axios with a bunch of just just perfect. I love Axios because they just
[46:24.000 --> 46:30.080]  they have this style of like just getting right to the point. And if the whole point is only 200
[46:30.080 --> 46:34.320]  words, it's a 200 word story and there's no padding. But they just had a great list of
[46:34.320 --> 46:39.360]  questions of, you know, you know, just more or less, how do we know that this actually is real?
[46:39.360 --> 46:44.480]  Because you guys said, Google is answering, right? Which is the astounding part. Because usually,
[46:44.480 --> 46:47.680]  yeah, you, you talk to the end, even if you don't get a statement on the record,
[46:47.680 --> 46:52.000]  you get enough background information to be able to convey, right? Like, yes, it really is working
[46:52.000 --> 46:56.480]  or no, or this. And it's astounding for two reasons. Because first, like, there's this whole
[46:56.480 --> 47:02.080]  trust, but verify thing. And Google has enormous credibility with assistance. But they you can't
[47:02.080 --> 47:06.400]  go on stage and show a product that's not real. That's just right, you lose so much credibility.
[47:06.960 --> 47:12.240]  But also, you can't not demo it at all, for anybody that that product is not real, unless
[47:12.240 --> 47:15.920]  you've shown it to somebody outside the company. Right. And it's like, I wrote in my last,
[47:15.920 --> 47:18.720]  hopefully last piece on this until something actually ships.
[47:21.680 --> 47:25.760]  As far as I'm concerned, you know, unless it comes out, you know, maybe in the next, you know,
[47:25.760 --> 47:34.560]  week or so. I was right. It wasn't. It wasn't listenable as recorded in in May, like if it
[47:34.560 --> 47:40.480]  ended up that shipping in some limited means in August, that doesn't mean that I was wrong that
[47:40.480 --> 47:46.880]  it wasn't ready in May. Right? Like it famously and people aren't angry about it. But back in 2002,
[47:46.880 --> 47:53.840]  there was a New York Times story that claimed that Apple was working on an on a cell phone that
[47:53.840 --> 48:00.480]  ran Mac OS X. Yeah. And I wrote really one of the first articles that during fireball 2002 was the
[48:00.480 --> 48:06.560]  year I started the site. And I called it I phony. And I just tried to explain this is what they're
[48:06.560 --> 48:14.800]  describing is impossible. And then people stumble on that site. Now, this is four years before the
[48:14.800 --> 48:20.560]  iPhone. People stumble on that article. And they're like, you know, usually in good in good cheer,
[48:20.560 --> 48:25.440]  but they're like, wow, you really blew that one. Because you know, what they're describing does
[48:25.440 --> 48:31.760]  sound a lot like the iPhone. It's a cell phone that runs a modified version of OS X. But I wasn't
[48:31.760 --> 48:39.040]  wrong in 2002. It literally was impossible to get Mac OS X Mac OS X barely ran on peace on Macs in
[48:39.040 --> 48:47.040]  2002. Right? It was it was barely running on Macs that was pre low bought pre purple pre everything
[48:47.040 --> 48:57.040]  right like and it it was a technical miracle that it ran in 2006 you know or 2007 I guess when it
[48:57.040 --> 49:04.880]  actually shipped like it was like the unbelievable feats of hardware and software engineering to get
[49:04.880 --> 49:13.040]  it working the way it was in 2006 and 2002 arm hardware and mobile GPUs and right display
[49:13.040 --> 49:17.200]  technology. None of it was there. Like, just because it happened four years later doesn't
[49:17.200 --> 49:21.280]  mean that I wasn't right in 2002. And I feel like the same thing is going to happen with this Google
[49:21.280 --> 49:27.120]  Assistant where, again, I don't dispute that among all companies or or, you know, include
[49:28.000 --> 49:34.400]  university AI, you know, labs and stuff like that, that if anybody's close to getting a vocal
[49:34.400 --> 49:38.960]  assistant that can do this, I would bet on Google, there's no doubt in my mind, I think you'd be a
[49:38.960 --> 49:45.920]  fool not to make them the odds on favorite to get something like this working first. Like, that's
[49:45.920 --> 49:50.880]  where it's so exasperating where it felt like, you know, there would be people on Twitter telling me
[49:51.680 --> 49:57.440]  that I'm just bent out of shape because Siri is so far behind. I you know, I don't understand how
[49:57.440 --> 50:02.000]  far ahead Google Assistant is. It's like now that has nothing to do with it. I just smell a fishy
[50:02.000 --> 50:06.080]  demo. There was a whole feeling about that show. They mentioned the word AI so often that they
[50:06.080 --> 50:09.200]  thought we were afraid, like it felt like they were afraid we were going to forget that AI
[50:09.200 --> 50:14.960]  existed. And the entire thing was so cocky and so so full of hubris that they were just it felt
[50:14.960 --> 50:18.640]  like we want to show off our technology, we want to show that we're the leaders. And that's not
[50:18.640 --> 50:21.760]  what these things should be about, at least in my opinion, they should be about like, again, like
[50:21.760 --> 50:25.600]  the responsibility that comes with these things. I think that's the gist of why we felt uncomfortable
[50:25.600 --> 50:29.440]  with it. Well, and think about it this way, too, in terms of how would they get that how you know,
[50:29.440 --> 50:32.880]  if you're thinking like I am like that they probably made some kind of catastrophic,
[50:32.880 --> 50:38.720]  not catastrophic, but a terrible mistake in terms of overselling where they were. And like,
[50:38.720 --> 50:44.640]  one way to think about it is just which tense verb do you use? You know, like, you know,
[50:44.640 --> 50:52.480]  nobody was saying in February, HomePod includes do present tense includes support for stereo pairing.
[50:54.000 --> 51:00.560]  Everybody wrote it in the future tense, that Apple says it will ship an update later this year
[51:00.560 --> 51:06.320]  to enable dual speakers. Whereas the headlines for this duplex thing, I have I cited a whole
[51:06.320 --> 51:11.760]  bunch of examples. And I don't blame them. I kind of got hooked into that present tense on day one,
[51:11.760 --> 51:16.160]  right, just kind of trusted Google. But they're all written in the present tense. Google Assistant
[51:16.160 --> 51:22.160]  can now make phone calls, you know, to make appointments for you. And that's I really think
[51:22.160 --> 51:27.200]  that's wrong. They didn't show that. And I think it makes a difference. Yeah, no, totally. I mean,
[51:27.200 --> 51:31.120]  AirPower still hasn't shipped, but they were sitting there on the on the tables when we
[51:31.120 --> 51:35.040]  went backstage, right? And you could and you could pick up the phone and see that it stopped
[51:35.040 --> 51:39.360]  charging and put it back down and see that it started charging and pick up their sample
[51:39.360 --> 51:44.160]  watch that was on it. And, you know, it was there for us to play with. And, you know,
[51:44.160 --> 51:49.920]  again, it was obviously a prototype. But they had prototypes that, you know, and again, I didn't have
[51:49.920 --> 51:54.560]  a stopwatch to see, you know, how fast it charged. I don't know. But I mean, at least in terms of
[51:54.560 --> 51:59.920]  what you could do in five minutes hands on time, it was, it was there to play with. All right,
[51:59.920 --> 52:04.480]  enough on that. Let me let me take another break here and thank our good friends, such good friends,
[52:04.480 --> 52:11.520]  longtime sponsors of the show Squarespace. Look, Squarespace is your all in one place to make a
[52:11.520 --> 52:16.640]  website, right? You can register the domain you pick from a whole bunch of really beautiful
[52:16.640 --> 52:23.040]  templates. They're customizable out the wazoo. So you can do this if you're, let's say you're not a
[52:23.040 --> 52:28.240]  web developer, you don't really have those chops at all. But you are a designer, you know how to
[52:28.240 --> 52:31.920]  make logos, you know how to pick colors, you know how to pick fonts and stuff like that. And you
[52:31.920 --> 52:40.800]  know how to your graphic designer. You can use Squarespace to make a branded website that fits
[52:40.800 --> 52:46.640]  with the design that you want. And again, they have templates to get you started, but you're not
[52:46.640 --> 52:51.520]  like locked into them where your site is going to end up looking exactly like one of these templates,
[52:51.520 --> 52:57.600]  you can customize it out the wazoo. There are so many websites that you encounter on a daily basis
[52:57.600 --> 53:01.520]  that are made with Squarespace. And you'd never know it unless you look at the do view source
[53:01.520 --> 53:05.040]  and start looking to see whether stuff is being served from the Squarespace domain. It's really
[53:05.040 --> 53:11.840]  amazing. You know, a ton of my favorite restaurant sites in particular, notoriously used to be
[53:11.840 --> 53:15.920]  terrible. I mean, it was a joke, but it was actually true where you go to a restaurant
[53:15.920 --> 53:20.160]  website, and you couldn't, they wouldn't even have like the hours listed. It's nuts. When you
[53:20.160 --> 53:24.880]  go to a restaurant website, and it's actually like a nice website, looks good, loads fast,
[53:24.880 --> 53:29.920]  has all the stuff you'd want, I swear, at least two out of three times you view source, it's a
[53:29.920 --> 53:34.960]  Squarespace site, it you're encountering Squarespace sites all the time. And the reason why
[53:34.960 --> 53:40.560]  is it's, it's so much easier than doing it by hand. And they take care of all the technical
[53:40.560 --> 53:48.480]  stuff, the actual hosting, the making sure it's reliable, providing great analytics in a simple
[53:48.480 --> 53:52.080]  it just like everything else at Squarespace, the presentation of the analytics you get from a
[53:52.080 --> 53:57.040]  Squarespace site, where people are going, where they're getting to your site from, it's all
[53:57.040 --> 54:03.280]  beautiful, really logically designed reports. I can't recommend it enough. And it means that you
[54:03.280 --> 54:07.520]  don't have to worry about any of those details. So if you are running a restaurant, or you're
[54:07.520 --> 54:13.840]  setting up something for, you know, your kids Little League team, or your, your church or
[54:13.840 --> 54:18.960]  something like that, you don't have to worry about the technical aspects, you don't waste time with
[54:18.960 --> 54:23.520]  stuff that you're shouldn't be wasting time on really, really can't recommend enough that the
[54:23.520 --> 54:27.200]  next time you need to make a new website or somebody you know, comes to you for help making
[54:27.200 --> 54:33.120]  a website, push them to Squarespace first and see how far you can go, you're probably going to stay
[54:33.120 --> 54:38.320]  there. So make your next move, get your own unique domain and create a beautiful website at

[55:14.080 --> 55:19.360]  some court documents on the iPhone six Ben gate. And the story the headline they use internal
[55:19.360 --> 55:26.560]  documents show Apple knew the iPhone six would bend. Which I mean, I didn't I wasn't a huge fan
[55:26.560 --> 55:31.520]  of how the story got covered. Like my understanding is Apple has this materials department and they
[55:31.520 --> 55:36.800]  understand materials. So for example, when they move from the aluminum iPhone to the plastic iPhone
[55:36.800 --> 55:41.440]  two g, they knew that plastic was more likely to crack, but it had some benefits over aluminum for
[55:41.440 --> 55:45.120]  them. Then when they moved to glass, they knew that glass was more likely to break. But there
[55:45.120 --> 55:48.960]  were benefits to move into glass anyway. Same thing when they moved from the iPhone five,
[55:49.680 --> 55:54.080]  the iPhone five design, which had the I figured it was aluminum or stainless steel band on it,
[55:54.080 --> 55:59.600]  and the and the aluminum back, they knew that the larger surface and the the lack of the frame was
[55:59.600 --> 56:03.840]  going to allow it to bend more because physics they knew these things, but they were trade offs
[56:03.840 --> 56:09.040]  that they thought were important to make. And over the course of the iPhone six life's lifespan,
[56:09.040 --> 56:13.040]  when they had millions of people using it, they found out exactly where those issues were. And
[56:13.040 --> 56:17.360]  just like they made every product like the iPhone eight glass is way better than the iPhone four s
[56:17.360 --> 56:22.880]  glass. The iPhone six s aluminum frame is way better than the six. So it's like they knew
[56:22.880 --> 56:27.440]  because they understand material sciences, but this made it sound very conspiratorial.
[56:27.440 --> 56:30.960]  Right? It makes it sound conspiratorial. And the problem starts right in the headline where it
[56:30.960 --> 56:37.120]  says Apple knew the iPhone six would bend. Well, everything can bend. Yes. Right. Ceramic shatters,
[56:37.120 --> 56:44.880]  right? Every material is the problem is that you need to say relative to what and the article does
[56:44.880 --> 56:49.680]  then go on to say that it bends more easily than the iPhone five s, which is the model it was
[56:49.680 --> 56:54.240]  replacing at the top of the product line. Well, duh, it's, of course, it bends more easily than
[56:54.240 --> 56:59.520]  the five s. I mean, we know that, right? We know that from all the videos, like you can be a strong
[56:59.520 --> 57:04.000]  person can take an iPhone six, or at least the ones that shipped originally. And if they really
[57:04.000 --> 57:09.280]  try hard, they could bend it with their own hands. And an iPhone five s doesn't bend like that. Of
[57:09.280 --> 57:14.560]  course, it bends more easily than a five s, it's bigger, has a bigger surface area. The
[57:15.760 --> 57:21.280]  comparison isn't does it bend more easily than the five s it's the comparison is does it bend
[57:21.280 --> 57:27.200]  too easily to have shipped as the design? That's the question. And it's not answered at all in
[57:27.200 --> 57:32.640]  these documents. And I would say that the fact that the iPhone six remained in the product line
[57:32.640 --> 57:40.560]  until last year, which suggests that it was fine. It was, you know, obviously a con to the new
[57:40.560 --> 57:48.480]  design, but not catastrophic. You know, yeah. And again, like the iPhone, the iPhone three g
[57:48.480 --> 57:52.720]  cracked, it could crack, the plastic would crack along the buttons. The iPhone four had the antenna
[57:52.720 --> 57:57.520]  issues and Apple kept that in the lineup after the four s all of design is compromised, material
[57:57.520 --> 58:02.560]  science is compromised. And this is a normal process of development for a product. There is
[58:02.560 --> 58:09.360]  now there is the case that they did somewhat at some point in the iPhone sixes product lifespan,
[58:09.360 --> 58:17.360]  they did alter it with some kind of reinforcement. Yes, the bend point. But I believe I think that
[58:17.360 --> 58:23.680]  anybody who had problems up until that point, if it was still under warranty could get it replaced.
[58:23.680 --> 58:30.640]  Yeah, I believe. Right. I think it was covered. I believe so. I mean, and if not,
[58:32.240 --> 58:37.040]  I guess that's a problem. But I believe it was covered. Apple is usually pretty good. But they
[58:37.040 --> 58:40.880]  have and this is the same thing with the keyboard issue. They have internal metrics. And when
[58:40.880 --> 58:44.240]  something becomes an issue, it's an automatic alert. And then people have to make a decision
[58:44.240 --> 58:48.880]  about it. But it has to reach that level. Apple is just too big a company. Sad to say this,
[58:48.880 --> 58:53.120]  but like 1% of Apple users is a huge amount of people. But if an issue fluctuates one to two
[58:53.120 --> 58:57.600]  to 3% within a product lifestyle, that's not exploding phones, you know, like some, there's
[58:57.600 --> 59:01.760]  always some battery failure in every phone. It's when it's catastrophic that it becomes a problem.
[59:01.760 --> 59:09.040]  Yeah. The iPhone four and Tennegate is my favorite example of that because it's like the tech press,
[59:09.040 --> 59:14.640]  you know, became, you know, it was like blood in the water, a bunch of, you know, sharks attacking
[59:14.640 --> 59:19.760]  it. I mean, the extraordinary, you know, truly extraordinary in hindsight that Apple held the
[59:19.760 --> 59:26.160]  special press event just to address and Tennegate. I mean, they had to because it was reproducible,
[59:26.160 --> 59:32.160]  like you could take any iPhone four and reproduce attenuation. It didn't affect everybody because
[59:32.160 --> 59:36.000]  it would only lower the signal by a certain amount. And if you had a good signal, you didn't
[59:36.000 --> 59:40.480]  even notice it. But if you were barely online, you could use it as a play pause button.
[59:40.480 --> 59:45.360]  Right. It's a, it's a, to me, it's a casebook example of how to handle a PR crisis, right?
[59:45.360 --> 59:49.680]  It's take your time, get your ducks in a row, but then get out in front of it as far out in
[59:49.680 --> 59:54.640]  front of it as you can. But the thing in hindsight that to me proves that it wasn't really a
[59:54.640 --> 01:00:03.360]  catastrophic or scandalous problem is that the iPhone four was the, the top of the line iPhone
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:08.560]  for a longer stretch of time without any alteration to the antenna design for than any
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:15.040]  other phone, because it was the last one that shipped in late June. And then the iPhone four
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:20.880]  S was the first one that shipped in the fall. And I think even that one that was late and shipped in
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:29.840]  October. Yes. So it was the top selling iPhone for like 16 or 17 months on the market for years,
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:36.880]  especially in the market for years afterwards as a lower priced option in the line with a completely
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:45.440]  unchanged antenna design. Now, yes, they did change that style of antenna design,
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.120]  starting with the Verizon iPhone four that came out, you know, like six months off cycle.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:57.920]  And then they use that Verizon style and antenna with the four S and that was better. And it's,
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:02.240]  you know, to me very much analogous to the way that the iPhone six S used a higher grade
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:08.240]  aluminum than the iPhone six. That's just progress, you know? Yeah. But it was it,
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.560]  was it bad enough that it never should have shipped in the first place? No. Yeah. But at
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:16.640]  the same token, if, if a hundred percent, if you could show keyboard failure to a hundred percent
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.720]  level, like you could go to an Apple store and make any Apple keyboard fail, or you could go to
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:25.280]  an Apple store and make every iPhone six bend, you'd have to treat it similarly. But these things
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:32.080]  have so, so few instances compared to something like the, like the antenna issue that you just
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:38.960]  can't hold them in the same sphere. Uh, all right, let's move on. Apple accepts, then rejects
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:47.920]  valves, steam link app. Boy, this is a weird story because it's not like, uh, you know, like,
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:54.320]  you know, me and you decide to make an app and we're indie developers and we have a rejection
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:02:00.080]  problem over questionable grounds, uh, you know, which is bad enough. And as often, you know,
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:04.160]  something that we'll write about, uh, or talk about or whatever, but this is steam. This is not
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:12.400]  our valve, you know, this, this is not like a developer. This is, uh, uh, uh, uh, huge game
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:16.560]  developer, probably one of the most important game developers in the world. Right. And they
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:21.920]  don't interact with Apple the way that indie developers interact with Apple through the
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:29.920]  black hole of the iTunes submission thing. And both sides are pros, you know,
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:35.920]  you know, valve is so far, at least publicly is taking this with a stiff upper lip. Um,
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:42.080]  and they didn't make it public. They did bring the negotiations public. Well, they had to though,
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:48.800]  they had to because the part that's so weird is it, it seems clear. I don't, this isn't fair,
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:53.760]  but it seems clear that, that they had been in contact with Apple in advance while they were
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:59.520]  working on bringing steam link and, and just, I, I'm not an expert on these things, but basically
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:05.280]  my understanding is that steam link is like VNC for gaming. So if you have a Mac or PC in your
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:11.760]  house with steam installed and steam is like a Netflix for video games type thing, where except
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.200]  you can buy, but you know, you can go there, you can pub it's like their own little app store for
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:21.200]  games for PC games. Um, very well respected company. People love it. There's all sorts of cool
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:26.960]  indie games that are on steam. Um, it's a great service. Steam link is a way you have your,
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:32.320]  you have your Mac or PC somewhere in your, on your land, in your house with steam installed,
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:37.040]  you put steam link on your iPhone, and now you can play these games. And I guess where it would
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:42.560]  really be cool would be on Apple TV, where you could use a controller. Um, but then you can play
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:49.040]  these games over your, and it just streams over your wifi. Um, and you can't do it outside your
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:54.720]  house. You can't like go to, to, you know, three blocks away and then get on cellular and do it
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:04:01.680]  from anywhere. It's not streaming from valves servers. Um, it's only a way to connect to the
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:06.560]  thing that's already in your house. When you're in your house, it seems pretty clear that somebody,
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:13.360]  some connections at some levels valve and Apple were in communication on this in advance. Then
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:19.840]  they finished and submitted it and it was accepted and that's when valve announced it. And then the
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:24.480]  next day it's, it, you know, see, yeah, again, we don't know this, but it seems pretty clear
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:28.000]  that some other, you know, it was like the left-handed Apple was like, yeah, yeah, this
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.200]  is great. Can't wait to have it. We'll promote it. We've got to, you know, we've probably had
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:37.760]  like an app store promotion ready to go. Uh, and then the right hand was like, uh, what is this?
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:43.600]  And then it got canceled and I kind of feel like Apple's in the wrong on this one. I get it. And
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:50.160]  again, this isn't about whether they should be protecting the app stores, 30%, you know,
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:54.880]  revenue share for any kind of in-app purchase in general. Let's just, let's just say for the sake
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:59.280]  of argument that we all agree that that's fine and it's a good business practice. And, and,
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:05.040]  you know, Apple is well warranted to protect it. Uh, I don't think this is that I don't think this
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:11.760]  is an end around the app stores 30, 70 split. Yeah. It's super interesting to me. You famously,
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:16.240]  when, uh, in-app purchases were first came out, you couldn't do it with free apps because Apple
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:21.360]  didn't want an end run around the app store. They thought maybe, uh, paranoid or maybe not
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:26.320]  that the minute the, you could put, you could make transactions outside the app store. Everyone would
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:30.480]  make a free app. They would have their own commerce running on the backend and Apple would
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:34.080]  essentially be maintaining the world's largest free app store for no money. And Apple doesn't
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:38.320]  operate things at a loss. So then when they did make it free apps could use in-app purchases.
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:42.400]  They said, you can't run your own store because again, they knew that everyone would just make a
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:47.280]  placeholder app and do all their commerce. This has some slight flavor to that because you can
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:51.840]  go and buy all your games on steam and then play them on iPhone and games is by far the biggest
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:57.120]  revenue generator for, uh, the app store. But I think with Apple, it's, it's not always about
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:01.760]  money. It's, it's about control of the platform. And the only thing I can see with this is that
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:07.360]  they don't want to seed control of iPhone gaming to valve and paranoid world. This might be that
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:12.800]  it games might be number one overall, but I did look, I was curious the other day and I looked at
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:17.120]  the top grossing, which you, you can't get to on the iPhone anymore. As far as I can tell,
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:21.200]  they don't, they have top paid apps and top free apps on the iPhone app store,
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:26.480]  but they don't list top grossing anymore. Yeah. Um, but they still do have it in like on the
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:31.520]  website and I guess in iTunes. Um, and I thought it was pretty interesting in the top five. And
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:35.120]  this is related to something Ben Thompson and I were talking about, which is that these
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:40.320]  pay to play games like candy crush are, you know, kind of a ethically questionable territory.
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:48.560]  Yeah. It's like a casino game. Uh, and it's kind of off brand for Apple to, to be involved in that
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:53.920]  to any degree. And on my analogy to that would be like, uh, you go on a, uh, a cruise ship.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:58.640]  Uh, and they, you know, they usually have a, almost always have a casino somewhere on board
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:02.960]  the ship because once you're in international waters, you know, there's no laws and, you know,
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:07.200]  I don't know if you've ever heard this, but casinos can be rather profitable for the casino owner.
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:13.520]  Uh, the Disney cruise line does not have casinos. Yes. Um, not because it's not profitable,
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:19.040]  but because I, I, I believe that they've, you know, they've concluded probably correctly that
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:24.080]  it's too off brand for them, for their, their, the Disney brand. Um,
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:30.480]  I, you know, but anyway, I looked at the top grossing apps and number one was Netflix.
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:39.200]  Um, uh, Hulu was like five and, uh, Pandora was three. So three at the top five. And again,
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:44.320]  I don't know how that goes with the long tail. You know, I bet the long tail has a lot more games
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:49.920]  than streaming services. Like, you know, there just aren't that many streaming services like
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:55.600]  Netflix and Pandora and Hulu. Um, but I thought that was a pretty good sign in terms of there's
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:08:02.000]  a source of revenue where there's no moral qualms about it, right? When you pay 10 bucks or 12 bucks
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:07.040]  a month for Netflix and you get Netflix, that's a fair deal. You're you, you knew exactly what
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:12.480]  you're getting into. You're not getting, uh, badgered, uh, uh, you know, give us another
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:16.880]  dollar and we'll, we'll take out the commercial, you know, uh, you're getting what you paid for.
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:22.560]  So anyway, I'm not quite sure. They figured out early on in the app store, not they, I mean,
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:27.200]  uh, game developers that people would not pay $10 for a game. They wouldn't even pay $5 for a game,
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:30.400]  but they would pay 50 to a hundred dollars to have a better farm than their friends.
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:35.680]  Or to get their car back on those on the track faster because they were bored. We will pay for
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:40.720]  ego gratification and instant gratification. And that's the best way to separate a human being from
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:45.120]  their money. And everyone has gone all in on this and it's led to the detriment of the gaming
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:49.840]  industry. But to your point, yeah, Disney does not have casinos. Usually profitable does not have
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:53.520]  them. Uh, and there's an argument to be made that Apple could run an app store. That's very
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:58.720]  different than this just by policy decisions alone. Um, but the, to the previous thing,
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:02.560]  this whole thing with, with valve is so bizarre because you have Phil Schiller commenting on it
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:06.480]  now saying that they're discussing it with valve and they're working on problems in the app store.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:10.160]  And I like, I like to give Apple not the benefit of the doubt, but I like to assume that I don't
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:14.720]  know everything. Like famously everyone got super upset when Apple banned a popular app from the
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:19.520]  app store and it turned out that that developer had a ton of shady stuff going on as well. And
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:24.400]  we just all thought Apple was guilty immediately until all of that came out. So I don't, you never
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:28.320]  know if there's like a privacy concern or a security risk or something like the VPN connection
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:32.160]  isn't secure and they want to work on it. I just don't know here, but I'd like to find out what's
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:37.520]  happening. The Schiller thing came in an email to, uh, you know, Joe random customer who just
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:43.440]  wrote to Schiller knowing that he's, you know, the, the direct, you know, the app store, the
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:48.400]  buck stops with him with the app store. Um, you know, and, and when people like Phil Schiller
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:51.440]  right back to somebody like that, they know there's a chance that the guy's going to turn
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:55.200]  around and he actually sent it to me too. I didn't realize until yesterday cause I was catching up on
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:00.560]  email, but he sent it to me, sent it to Mac rumors. Uh, I don't, you know, I wouldn't do
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:04.560]  that personally, but I, I, it's clear from the way Schiller wrote the email, he knew that I could
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:08.960]  leak, uh, and it, you know, written very carefully. There's nothing embarrassing. I thought it was
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:13.440]  interesting that he listed user generated content as a problem and I don't know enough about seam.
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:17.760]  I don't know if they've got like games where you get to dress up as a Nazi or, or, you know,
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:24.160]  adult content or something like that. I, I, but that user generated content, I, you know,
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:28.640]  it sounds like it might be a little bit more than just, Hey, we think it's an end around the 70 30
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:34.320]  split. There's been issues with apps that include a discussion groups previously. Like it's
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:38.400]  interesting because Apple has Safari and you can get anything in the world on Safari, but when it
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.920]  comes to the app store, even embedding web views for awhile was controversial. They wanted me to
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:45.920]  put that 18 and over sticker on it. And then it was discussion groups. You know, what was the
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:49.040]  content of the discussion groups? So it seems like that's something they still wrestle with.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:53.120]  Yeah. All right. Let me take a third and final break here. Thank our, uh, our third sponsor.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:11:00.560]  What does it really a trifecta of great sponsors on this episode? This one it's for Eero. Now Eero
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:09.360]  is a wifi system for consumers that lets you build out what's called a mesh network. And that
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:14.400]  basically you've probably heard about this, uh, but you get like a couple of pieces of hardware.
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:18.560]  They're all about the little puck size things about the size of an Apple TV, the main ones,
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.400]  and you put a couple of them throughout your house and, and their website will make it clear.
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:26.240]  You give it the square footage or, you know, how many floors you have or something like that. And
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:31.520]  they'll help you decide how many you might need. Um, you said one of them is the main one that
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:35.920]  connects to like your cable modem or your files connection or whatever, but it's the same. It
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:40.320]  doesn't matter which one you pick. It's the same hardware. And then the other ones in the house,
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:45.920]  they just talk to each other and they create one network. So it's not like you've got like three,
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:49.920]  if you've got three of them, that you have three networks and your phone has to be ready to switch
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:56.320]  from one network to another. The way these mesh networks work is three devices work together to
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:00.960]  create the illusion of one network that your devices use. And it could just fill your house
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:07.360]  with really solid wifi. There is no way in my current house that one base station could ever,
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:12.960]  uh, it's, it's, it's a row home in Philly and it just goes up and it just signals don't go
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:19.280]  through floors very well. Um, there's just no way that one base station would, uh, would work. It
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:25.280]  just wouldn't. Uh, so we've switched to Euro a while ago. Apple's out of the base station game.
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:30.400]  Now. Um, I really can't think of a better one than Euro to recommend. I mean,
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:33.520]  no, they're the sponsor. I'm getting paid to tell you this, but I'm telling you,
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:37.520]  even if they weren't, it's what I would tell you to look at first. You set it up with a fan,
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:42.000]  a really nice iPhone app. They have an Euro iPhone app. You manage the network with it,
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:48.640]  but you don't feel like you're like a junior network engineer. It really is a setup process
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:54.320]  that an Apple user would appreciate, uh, where you're not typing in weird one nine
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:13:00.480]  two dot one six eight IP addresses to log into a skanky web server running on the thing. It's
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:07.280]  a really nice app. You can name the devices, tell them which room they're in all very graphical. Um,
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:11.120]  you could even run like a speed test, see what type of performance you're getting right within
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:19.440]  the app. Um, and the second generation products that Euro has, uh, include something called the
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:24.800]  Euro beacon. It's half the size of the regular Euro base station, which is already pretty small,
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:30.000]  but it's even more, it's half the size and you can simply plug it into a wall outlet to expand
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.920]  coverage into any room. So if you just need a little oomph just to get to like the fourth floor
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:37.920]  of your house or something like that, you can just add as many of these beacons as you want.
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:42.800]  If there's an outlet, there's wifi. Uh, and since the beacon doesn't have an ethernet port,
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:50.400]  uh, you do need at least one regular Euro to connect at the modem. But other than that,
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:54.480]  you could just use these beacons and they're even included. You think it sounds like a nightlight,
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:58.320]  you just put it in a socket. Well guess what? They have an led nightlight in the device so
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:02.880]  you could use it as a nightlight. And of course, if you don't want to, you can turn it off very
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:09.120]  easily right in the app. They even have an ambient lights sensor though so that if you want to use
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:13.120]  it, it'll just intelligently adjust the brightness automatically depending on the time of day and how
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:18.080]  much light there actually is in the room where you have it. Just a great idea. Really a great way to
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:23.200]  go. You know, the second generation is such a great upgrade in terms of just being easy and
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:28.880]  small and, and convenient. Um, really love, uh, love this product. I love the company.
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:34.960]  A very happy customer. Me. Um, they even have incredible customer support. So if you do need
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:39.760]  help and you probably won't, but you can get ahold of a wifi expert in 30 seconds or less.
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:45.840]  Most times of the day. Um, I have one running right now. I'm talking to Renee over in Euro

[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:24.240]  free shipping. So my thanks to, to Euro. Mine actually just arrived yesterday. I haven't set
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:29.520]  it up yet, but the box came yesterday. Isn't it nice? It's a nice packaging too. Yeah. It's
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:35.440]  beautiful. Uh, uh, really it's great stuff. I was just looking at it the other day in my,
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:38.640]  in my bedroom and I was like, you know how you know, this is nice is that my wife doesn't
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:43.360]  complain that we have a wifi base station in our bedroom. Well, we were, we were just talking about
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:48.720]  it after Apple discontinued the airport line. Like which company do you trust? Because this is your
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:52.160]  data. It's your data on the front line of the internet. And there's a lot of companies whose
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:16:00.160]  businesses predicated on the collection and use of your data to put it delicately. And Apple was a
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:03.360]  company that you could trust. They didn't care what data you had and it was hard finding another
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:09.760]  company like that. But Euro is so former Apple engineer and Apple's mindset centric that it was
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:19.360]  an easy choice. Yeah. Um, anyway, uh, before we move on to WWDC rumors, uh, of which there's not
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:24.080]  a lot to talk about really, which is kind of exciting. Uh, iOS 11.4 and airplay two shipped
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:34.240]  yesterday. And finally, I think this is truly an unironic finally, uh, but in my practice so far,
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:39.120]  I like we have two home pods in the house. I moved the one, you know, from the bedroom down into the
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:44.560]  kitchen. So we have two in the kitchen to play with the stereo. Uh, everything works exactly
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:51.040]  as it says on the tin. I was just as easy to set up a stereo pair as Apple had promised, even with
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:56.640]  one that had already been configured in another room. Once I got this software update on the home
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:00.880]  pod, it immediately prompted me, Hey, I see you're in the same room as the other home pod. Do you
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:05.680]  want to set them up as a stereo pair? And I was like, yes. And then I immediately said, play
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:12.960]  whatever and whatever immediately started playing in stereo on the two devices. I, I cannot imagine
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:18.160]  how it could be easier to set them up. I really can't because if it was any more automatic,
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:22.000]  it might do it when you didn't want it to. And you can go in and tweak it. Like you can go in
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.400]  and switch the left and right and, and make them say tones to test and you can do all that. But
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:30.240]  the automatic setup is amazing. Yeah. The automatic setup is amazing. Uh, you know,
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:34.160]  it's a shame it took as long as it did, but apparently they wanted to get it right. And I
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:40.960]  have to say day one, it, it works seamlessly. I mean, it's exactly as promised. The interesting
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:45.120]  thing is they made a conscious decision to have Siri only respond from one of them. So by default,
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:49.200]  the left channel will be the one that has Siri. You can change it. Like when you ask series
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:53.040]  something, you can, the docs, I think, say you hold down on it and it will switch. I couldn't
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:58.800]  get that to work. But if I went to the right home pod and I said, turn on Siri, it would switch
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:02.000]  Siri to there and stay there. So you can move it back and forth. But I thought that was an
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:07.760]  interesting choice. I, the way I, it is interesting that they don't both talk at once. I can see why.
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:13.680]  Um, and it seems like it's a little smarter than that. It seems like in, in, in, uh,
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:18.160]  like when I was up in New York yesterday for a demo of this, um, and they had it set up like
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:23.760]  on two ends of a, of a, yeah, of a table against a wall, which I think is a very typical distance
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:30.880]  for stereo speakers in my kitchen. I set them up on different sides of the room and it seems to me,
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:36.400]  whichever one I'm facing is the one that answers me, which makes sense. Like, cause I'm not,
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:42.240]  I can't face both of them at the same time. So if I turn around and look at the one that doesn't seem
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:46.400]  to answer by default when I'm in a neutral physical position, it, that's the one that
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:49.840]  answers me though, because my voice is coming right at it. Yeah. That's interesting. So when
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:53.840]  I pair it, as far as I know, once you pair them, it just picks one, but it does use this,
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:58.000]  the microphone system from both of them all the time to make sure it hears you. Yeah. Well,
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.520]  try putting them on opposite sides of a room and I suspect you'll, you'll see that. I think it's
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:05.840]  just that if you're, if your voice is coming at both of them, more or less like from an
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:10.480]  ecological equilateral triangle position, there is a default one that always seems to answer.
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:14.800]  Yeah. I like it. Some of it is just so cool. Like you can do with Apple TV,
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:18.320]  you can do it with iPhone, but then you put them in other rooms and you can just say,
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:22.480]  play whatever song in the bedroom or play this song in the living room. And it just,
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:26.560]  I mean like to people who are not Apple people who've been doing this with Amazon or Google
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:30.480]  forever, they're laughing, but there's something about having it so deeply embedded in the Apple
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:35.600]  ecosystem and the way that Apple handles interface that makes it just as a very fluid experience.
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:39.200]  Yeah. I don't want, I wouldn't have a lot of time, so I'm not going to go on with it more, but
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:48.720]  I like it. Me too. WWDC rumors or lack thereof is my heading in the show notes. They double down.
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:54.160]  So who knows, you know, the stuff is the closer we get, the more likely stuff is to leak because
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:20:01.120]  it's just the nature of the game that they, you know, rehearsals and marketing material
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:07.040]  start getting finalized and more people are exposed to it. And, you know, it's no coincidence
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:12.720]  that like in the 48 hours before a keynote, there's often last minute leaks, which is,
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:17.680]  I think attributable simply to the fact that people who are less invested in it are suddenly
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:22.720]  have access to it and, you know, are willing to spoil the surprise. But we'll see, you know,
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:29.360]  Apple famously has, you know, issued that report earlier this year about leaking and how many
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:38.880]  leakers they've caught and like fired. Yeah. So we'll see. I don't know. I'm really hopeful
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:43.200]  though that not much more will leak because I think this is more exciting. I think it's way
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:50.160]  more exciting to like kind of not even to know what's coming. I mean, I don't know if we know
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:54.640]  anything. There's two sorts of leaks. Like there are leaks when something is doing something wrong
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:57.920]  and it needs to get out, like people who are whistleblowers and stuff like that. But this
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:02.640]  is always more like spoilers. Do I want to read the plot to the next Marvel movie or the next
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:06.800]  Star Wars movie and then go see it and think the whole thing is boring because I already know it?
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:10.800]  No, I really don't. I have to monitor these things because it's my job. But if I didn't have to do
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:14.640]  this, I wouldn't want to know anything about the show. I'd want to go in there and really enjoy
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:18.080]  the hell out of it. So I'm kind of happy when stuff doesn't leak because it makes the show
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:24.480]  more exciting for me. I wrote something this week. Koi Vinh, friend of the show, had a really
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:28.080]  nice article about the custom illustration work that they're doing in the App Store.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:33.680]  This is with the iOS 11 App Store that debuted last year.
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:45.360]  Effectively, they're running it as a periodical. I don't think I know anybody in particular who's
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:49.200]  on that team, but I know that they've hired people from actual magazines,
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:54.000]  people who worked at like Cone Nast and other really high-end design magazines. It's run as
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:59.280]  a real editorial operation. I don't know if they're on staff or if they're all contract work, but they
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:05.680]  pay real illustrators to do real custom illustrations to accompany the articles that
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:11.600]  they write. It's really nice. As Koi says, in this world, so many people just go right to clipart
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:15.760]  instead of commissioning original artwork. It's nice to see somebody do that. I just wrote
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:21.840]  offhandedly that one of the things I'm looking forward to at WWDC is seeing the iOS App Store
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:28.080]  2.0 come to the Mac. I think it was like 9 to 5 Mac. It was like, oh, maybe Gruber knows something
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:35.360]  that we don't know. He often coyly drops them like that. This isn't the secret. I don't know
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:42.800]  if it's coming this year. I don't, but it was on my show last year where I asked Phil Schiller
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:47.920]  about it. He just said, we thought it was the right thing to do to bring it to iOS first,
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:53.600]  but we're invested in the Mac App Store. It's important to us. He didn't say it'll come next
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:23:00.320]  year, but he very strongly suggested that this sort of thinking will come to the Mac App Store.
[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:04.080]  I sort of thought it was almost understood because during the briefings last year,
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:08.960]  I think everybody asked about it and they said it was being worked on. It feels like a this year
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:16.960]  thing. This isn't like a deep dark secret little birdie. This was Phil Schiller on stage at a
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:22.160]  public event strongly insinuating that they were already at work on the Mac one. They're doing all
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:28.720]  of them. Every store is going to get this makeover. I completely agree with him. I think it's very
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:35.680]  obvious that it's the biggest and most important store. Of course, the iOS one got the treatment
[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:43.920]  first. That's something I expect next week. I wouldn't be surprised if maybe it's more than the
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:51.280]  Mac App Store. Maybe there is a new bookstore and other stuff. What else? There's rumors about a
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:57.200]  Beats branded Siri speaker, sort of like a little brother to the HomePod that would come at a lower
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:03.360]  price. Yeah, I guess the same way that the W1 chip went into Beats products and made AirPod
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:11.680]  equivalents, there'll be some Beats equivalent of the HomePod. Right. There's the thing from
[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:19.520]  months ago that Mark Gurman called Marzipan, which he says is some sort of secret effort to get
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:25.040]  iPhone apps running on the Mac. There were certain people who got very excited about this. I don't
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:33.760]  believe that's coming next week. I don't believe it actually is a way to get iOS apps running on
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:42.080]  the Mac. I think it's more of a cross-platform UI toolkit that would help you share code and
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:49.120]  components between Mac apps and iOS apps. I don't think it's like, boom, here's your iOS app running
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:54.480]  on the Mac with a recompile in Xcode or something like that. My understanding is that since Apple
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:58.720]  did that reorg, they've had this problem. The iMessage team has to build iMessage for iOS and
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:03.680]  iMessage for app. And across the company, they've built new and undisclosed tools that helps them
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:06.720]  do all this. And they're going to pick one. I don't think it's ready for this year either,
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:11.120]  but they're going to pick the ones that are best and write them as public tools, not internal
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:14.640]  tools, which are often, you know, see to your pants stuff and then we'll get this. But there's
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:19.360]  several interplaying projects. Yeah, I've been talking. Bottom line is that Apple's,
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:24.320]  you know, you'd think that they would have internalized this by now, but Apple, when they
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:30.480]  ship the stuff that they actually use themselves, it's the best developer stuff that they ship. And
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:38.800]  when they ship stuff that's like, good enough for you people, but we don't use it, it's buggy and
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:45.440]  incomplete. You know, the best example I could think of are just, well, maybe it's not the best
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:50.400]  well, maybe it's not the best example, but a simple example is that a year after the iPhone
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:54.800]  shipped and the App Store came, you know, was announced, you know, in February or whatever.
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:59.360]  And by the time the one year anniversary rolled around, they opened the App Store and developers
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:05.040]  had had three or four months that, you know, the App Store, you know, the eight, the public APIs
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:09.600]  for writing iPhone apps in 2008, right away, it didn't include everything Apple could do,
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:15.520]  because obviously Apple has to write the system level software that operates at the lowest levels.
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:20.640]  But for the most part, though, it gave third party developers ability to write apps as good
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:25.600]  as Apple's apps. And that, you know, maybe a lot of maybe some of Apple's apps were written
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:32.240]  completely within the API limitations of the public APIs. Compare and contrast with the
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:37.680]  original Apple Watch, where the original watch kit wasn't really native at all, but all the apps that
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:42.000]  Apple had on the watch were native. And so you'd launch one of Apple's apps on the watch, and it
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:47.040]  would open up and you could use it. And you'd launch a third party app and it would spin for
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:53.440]  30 or 40 seconds and maybe open. I mean, iOS, iPhone OS, too, that was a complete,
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:57.760]  Henri Lamoureux's team had to do a second forest march, basically. And I think Scott Forestall
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:02.000]  wrote scroll and table and they had to rewrite UI scroll and UI table and make them public. They
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.840]  were in no shape for public at first. Right. So the thing I've heard from a few developer friends
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:12.480]  about this cross platform UI toolkit, whatever it's called, is that they hope it's something
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:16.640]  that Apple themselves are using because there's a good chance then it'll be good. And they really
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:21.840]  hope it is not a, well, we don't use this, but you dummies who want a shared UI code between two
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:26.400]  platforms can, here you go. It's my understanding that there's a bunch of stuff Apple's using that
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:29.600]  they're going to sort of rewrite for public consumption over the next year or two.
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:35.200]  Other than that, man, what the hell else is coming? I guess hardware is confusing to me
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:38.720]  because like there was rumors of the new Mac book air, but that sounds like it was pushed off. There
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:42.800]  were rumors of the new iPad pros, but there've been zero leaks. And usually there's some hardware
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:47.600]  leaks from, from the supply chain. Right. And a curious thing if they don't do iPad pros
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:55.280]  is then presumably the next time it could happen would be September. Typically Apple these days,
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:28:00.320]  they used to sometimes have August events, but they don't have it in years. And even then they
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:05.520]  was like software, like for iLife apps or something. So if they don't do it at WWDC,
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:11.120]  then they're pushed back to September. And that would mean that the iPad pros either skips an
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:18.960]  entire generation of a, what are we up to? A11 processors and goes right to the A12 or the iPad
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:26.880]  pro gets the A11 an entire year late and remains a year behind CPU wise, you know, the, the iPhone,
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:34.160]  whatever it comes after the iPhone 10 and eight. Yeah. It's just curious. And the Macs are a huge
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:38.480]  question mark now because Intel is just having the worst ever since they went to 14 nanometers,
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:42.240]  they've had the worst time. They went from tick tock, tick tock to tick tock, optimize,
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:45.520]  optimize, optimize. And I've talked about this before, but every time I fall asleep,
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:49.840]  I'm afraid I'm going to wake up and they'll will have sandwiched another Lake in between
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:53.600]  Coffee Lake and Cannon Lake. So they've been there. A lot of the Mac delays we've seen lately
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:57.440]  are entirely because Intel hasn't had the chips ready. And I don't know if the Coffee Lake Mac
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:02.560]  chips are ready at this point. And insert, we don't have time to go on a long tangent about
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:08.720]  the hypothetical move to arm for the Mac. Yeah. Except to just say that at a certain level,
[01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:13.360]  you can hit, wave your hands over some of the technical complexities. It certainly would make
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:19.520]  sense for the Mac book. The Mac book would actually get a performance bump. I think my
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:25.840]  guess is that a Mac book running an Apple, a 12th processor, or even a 11 processor would get a
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:33.600]  nice performance boost across the board. The problem would be that there's, there's no known
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:38.400]  arm chips that compete with Intel at the high end for, let's just say the iMac pro, the Mac pro
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:43.920]  devices that Apple has publicly recommitted to very recently. So it's not like the story as well,
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:49.120]  they're getting out of the pro hardware game. In theory, Apple's chip team could have
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:55.280]  secretly been working on arm based chips that actually do compete at the highest levels of
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:30:01.200]  performance. But that would be shocking. I mean, it would be great news. It'd be terribly exciting,
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:07.280]  but it would be a thunderbolt out of the sky in terms of being, shaking up the industry.
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:13.760]  And just to put a little bow on it, I think it would be really difficult for Apple to move
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:20.000]  to ARM without moving the entire platform to ARM. I think it could also be super interesting if the
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.560]  Mac book and maybe sort of an Apple TV Mac mini hybrid were running purely on ARM. If the
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:32.240]  intermediary devices were fusion cores, where you had ARM cores for power efficiency, and you still
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:36.480]  had legacy Intel cores for compatibility and performance. And on the high end, they stay at
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:40.000]  Xeon because if there's one area that Intel is investing in, it's still the Xeon chips.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:47.120]  Yeah. So it's possible that they have something. It would be terribly exciting. But again, there's
[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:54.560]  no leaks about it. I mean, it's all just spike. It's just podcasters and Twitter users saying,
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:31:01.040]  well, maybe they'll switch to ARM. Yeah. I mean, they've had the same way they had Intel Macs in
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:06.400]  the closet for years. They've had ARM Macs in the closet for years. It just depends. They hold them
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:10.640]  over Intel's head to say, well, you guys aren't done yet, but actually shipping it raises a lot of
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:16.960]  implementation questions. Right. And every other time that they've switched from 68 K to power PC
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:22.080]  and then from power PC to Intel, there was like a one year transition period. And then after that
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:26.960]  year transition transition period, everything was running the new platform. It just, and again,
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:31.600]  they could do it, you know, it doesn't have to go that way, but for a bunch of reasons that we just
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:35.360]  don't have time to expand upon in detail, it just makes a lot more sense though, that if you're
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:39.280]  going to move, you move the entire platform from top to bottom. So I don't know. Or it also
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:43.360]  depends on the position it because you can, you could position it as an iOS clamshell and then
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:47.680]  you nicely sidestep a lot of the Mac issues. So what are we? We're, we're got Thursday, Friday,
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:52.720]  Saturday, Sunday, Monday. So we're five days out from the keynote. I'm going to say five days out
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:57.760]  from the keynote, we have less, we have fewer rumors about what might be in the keynote than
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:04.640]  any year I can remember. Yeah. Terribly exciting. Yeah. I'm thrilled. All right.
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:09.280]  Anything else? I got to go. Yeah. You got to go. I'm looking forward to seeing you on Monday.
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:15.200]  All right. Yeah. I can't wait to see you eat too. It'll be fun. Everybody can follow René on
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:22.160]  Twitter at René at René Ritchie. And of course, you can see all the fine work from him and his,
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:27.680]  his very talented staff at iMore.com. I'm sure they all have extensive coverage of the keynote
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:33.680]  and all the news on Monday.
