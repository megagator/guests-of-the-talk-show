[00:00.000 --> 00:07.160]  that should suddenly fix it oh yeah you sound much better now yeah so this can
[00:07.160 --> 00:13.680]  be the show you ready sure all right so I was on the wrong microphone when we
[00:13.680 --> 00:18.680]  started talking because the last episode I recorded on this machine which is the
[00:18.680 --> 00:24.720]  fifth 16-inch I'm never gonna get done calling it a 15-inch MacBook Pro was my
[00:24.720 --> 00:31.080]  two episodes ago with Casey Johnston where at the end of the show I switched
[00:31.080 --> 00:37.200]  live right in the middle of the show to the built-in microphone to talk about
[00:37.200 --> 00:43.360]  hey well or not both to talk about and to let you know what better use of a
[00:43.360 --> 00:48.760]  podcast is there to let the listeners of the podcast hear the quality of this
[00:48.760 --> 00:52.760]  supposedly studio quality mic and so I did it and I think it turned out pretty
[00:52.760 --> 00:59.200]  well but the other problem I wound up having I don't know if you listen to
[00:59.200 --> 01:02.680]  that show but I had to do like a little preamble before it because the whole
[01:02.680 --> 01:07.680]  show up to that point which was like two hours long recorded through my usual
[01:07.680 --> 01:15.600]  professional onyx blackjack XDR whatever they call it and this sure whatever
[01:15.600 --> 01:22.940]  Marco recommended to me microphone all had a bunch of static not and it was
[01:22.940 --> 01:29.160]  usable and like filtering it you know my editor Caleb Sexton filtered it and I
[01:29.160 --> 01:32.400]  think it was quite listenable but it was obviously not the usual audio quality
[01:32.400 --> 01:37.880]  and the worst part is I should have my friggin head examined because the last
[01:37.880 --> 01:44.960]  time that happened to me was when I was testing the previous 15-inch MacBook Pro
[01:44.960 --> 01:55.080]  and my connection from the blackjack dingus whatever it's called the onyx
[01:55.080 --> 02:02.300]  blackjack yeah yeah is a USB out USB be you know the one that that's the one
[02:02.300 --> 02:05.440]  everybody if you don't know printer cable yeah the printer square one yeah
[02:05.440 --> 02:11.320]  the square one looks like a printer cable to a USB a cable so to use that
[02:11.320 --> 02:20.520]  with a relatively new MacBook of any sort you need a dongle and last summer I
[02:20.520 --> 02:24.900]  recorded an entire episode it was the Q&A episode I did with myself with no
[02:24.900 --> 02:31.000]  guest and I did the whole thing and the static was so bad that was unusable but
[02:31.000 --> 02:34.480]  I felt like well this is the luckiest thing in the world because while I have
[02:34.480 --> 02:39.540]  to rerecord this entire episode I don't have to embarrass a guest and say I'm
[02:39.540 --> 02:42.540]  sorry but I need two more hours of your time and I need you to repeat yourself
[02:42.540 --> 02:46.600]  and I felt it came out better because I had never done an episode without a
[02:46.600 --> 02:51.360]  guest before and I feel like I did a better job on the second cut so it
[02:51.360 --> 02:56.280]  wasn't a disaster but the curious thing was that it wasn't like I used the same
[02:56.280 --> 03:01.520]  adapter same cable and just plugged it in again and it worked and it so it if
[03:01.520 --> 03:06.880]  you hear any static like and the worst part was Casey and I had a bit of Skype
[03:06.880 --> 03:12.960]  problems and it was definitely Skype I know Skype I was hearing her staticky
[03:13.600 --> 03:17.400]  but she didn't realize that what you were getting was not a Skype artifact
[03:17.400 --> 03:23.240]  no no and only she heard my static because this is the what makes this
[03:23.240 --> 03:27.400]  problem so devilish is my headphones that I'm monitoring my own audio on
[03:27.400 --> 03:33.640]  right now as we speak connect to the blackjack and so it goes from the mic to
[03:33.640 --> 03:40.880]  the blackjack to my headphones without ever touching the USB chain exactly so
[03:40.880 --> 03:43.840]  your Mac is recording something bad but you're not here because you're on the
[03:43.840 --> 03:48.940]  right on the mixer yeah and and she heard it but we chalked it up to Skype
[03:48.940 --> 03:52.400]  and since I was recording my own audio it wouldn't matter but in and turned out
[03:52.400 --> 04:00.040]  that I recorded all the static so anyway are you screwing with me actually I I
[04:00.040 --> 04:06.160]  have I have involved myself in so many podcast screw-ups over the years that I
[04:06.160 --> 04:09.840]  just am having flashbacks like I have a little catalog in my head now of like
[04:09.840 --> 04:13.880]  all the ways that a podcast can fail one of these days I'm gonna like do a book
[04:13.880 --> 04:17.640]  or a video series or something where I'm like I I've heard that problem whatever
[04:17.640 --> 04:22.440]  it is I've heard that problem and one of the amazing things that I discovered is
[04:22.440 --> 04:26.960]  there are some audio plugins that are obviously written for professional music
[04:26.960 --> 04:32.000]  people or professional video people or whatever that are really amazing even if
[04:32.000 --> 04:38.200]  it ends up being not perfect like there's a D static and a D crackle and a
[04:38.200 --> 04:43.120]  D all these D clicking things that you could just run on audio and I have
[04:43.120 --> 04:48.640]  rescued some spectacularly bad audio using this like it's like witchcraft the
[04:48.640 --> 04:56.800]  software that pro like pro audio plugins offer now yeah it's amazing so anyway I
[04:56.800 --> 05:00.720]  was so burned and scarred by that and I was so paranoid that it was gonna be
[05:00.720 --> 05:04.760]  unlistenable and I'd have to either I would have to ask Casey to through
[05:04.760 --> 05:10.400]  record or eat maybe just disappear from the earth and never do another episode
[05:10.400 --> 05:15.480]  of my podcast again but it turned out okay but I was so scarred by that that
[05:15.480 --> 05:20.000]  the last episode I did with Matty glacius I used my old personal 13-inch
[05:20.000 --> 05:25.840]  MacBook that uses the actual cable and I cuz I swore to myself John what you're
[05:25.840 --> 05:35.520]  gonna do is you're gonna spend $4 and get a new USB B to USB C cable mm-hmm so
[05:35.520 --> 05:38.480]  you don't have to have a dongle because it's clearly the dongle that introduces
[05:38.480 --> 05:42.520]  the point where maybe if the dongle isn't quite in the thing or the thing
[05:42.520 --> 05:46.840]  isn't quite in a dongle you know that that there's the problem and I'll spend
[05:46.840 --> 05:52.360]  money at Amazon on anything on a whim like if it just like a notion just pops
[05:52.360 --> 05:57.160]  into my head that I should buy a new whatever cable I'll do it and for some
[05:57.160 --> 06:02.400]  reason this cable which is actually essential to half of my professional life
[06:02.400 --> 06:06.680]  I've procrastinated on and here I am talking to you through a dongle again
[06:06.680 --> 06:10.600]  but I did switch to a differently I switched to a different dongle just in
[06:10.600 --> 06:16.080]  case that was the jinx I finally you sound great from here so I think we're
[06:16.080 --> 06:20.740]  good we're good I I did I finally bought one of those I bought the other of the
[06:20.740 --> 06:26.520]  other month I was gonna be doing some traveling and and using my iPad for some
[06:26.520 --> 06:29.980]  stuff and you know iPad Pro it's got a USB C on it and I said you know what I'm
[06:29.980 --> 06:35.520]  gonna do is any cable I need I'm going to get the new version that goes to USB
[06:35.520 --> 06:40.320]  C with no dongle just straight up like USB B to USB C or you like a micro or a
[06:40.320 --> 06:44.240]  mini I have all those cables now which is great because that means I'm
[06:44.240 --> 06:48.400]  basically not using that dongle anymore I'm just using the right cable now which
[06:48.400 --> 06:51.400]  is it's better it makes you feel better anyway to not have to worry about
[06:51.400 --> 06:56.840]  adapting anything yeah I'm working on a scheme a personal scheme like for a
[06:56.840 --> 07:00.280]  couple of years now I've I've espoused I've really enjoyed them and they've
[07:00.280 --> 07:07.240]  really made my life better is mono prices three and one cables have you ever
[07:07.240 --> 07:12.000]  seen these oh yeah yeah yeah right so it's USB a the one that we know
[07:12.000 --> 07:15.760]  everywhere the one everybody thinks of is USB on the end and you plug it into
[07:15.760 --> 07:21.560]  anything and then on the other end it's primary jack is a micro USB and you
[07:21.560 --> 07:25.960]  think micro USB that sucks but it's got two other little things it's like a
[07:25.960 --> 07:31.080]  little Trident and they're just like little rubber band type things and you
[07:31.080 --> 07:38.880]  can put a effectively like a lightning condom on the USB micro USB or you could
[07:38.880 --> 07:45.440]  take off the lightning and put a USB C on and so it's one cable that goes to
[07:45.440 --> 07:50.080]  all three things so you could charge your Kindle which for me at least is
[07:50.080 --> 07:54.640]  still micro USB I don't know if they've gotten that it seems to me like Amazon
[07:54.640 --> 08:01.160]  is like all in on micro USB for some reason but and it's a great great travel
[08:01.160 --> 08:05.560]  cable it's not the prettiest thing because whatever you're using there's
[08:05.560 --> 08:10.000]  something hanging off the side at the end but it's super useful and I buy them
[08:10.000 --> 08:15.040]  all from Monoprice in black and so for a while if I saw a black cable in my bag
[08:15.040 --> 08:19.240]  I knew it was that the problem is they don't make that sort of thing with USB
[08:19.240 --> 08:23.320]  C on the other end and now we're moving to the point where most of the things
[08:23.320 --> 08:29.280]  you want to plug the charging and you know into the power brick and need to be
[08:29.280 --> 08:34.240]  USB C so what I'm doing is working on a scheme I'm buying these nice gray
[08:34.240 --> 08:41.000]  cables from anchor not a sponsor I'm just a very happy user of the anchor
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.200]  various products so I'm buying these gray cables that use like a threaded
[08:46.200 --> 08:50.440]  cable you know what I mean like instead of a rubbery cable material it feels
[08:50.440 --> 08:54.620]  like a nice cloth yeah braided yeah I like I like those two there and they're
[08:54.620 --> 09:00.040]  a nice dark gray they're not black clearly dark gray and I'm using getting
[09:00.040 --> 09:04.800]  those I've bought two six footers and one three footer and then that's all I
[09:04.800 --> 09:09.320]  need and they're just direct USB C to USB C and then there's no confusion as
[09:09.320 --> 09:15.400]  to whether it's lightning on one end USB C on the other end if it's gray and
[09:15.400 --> 09:19.320]  threaded it is USB C on both ends and then I also know it's not Thunderbolt
[09:19.320 --> 09:25.360]  3 which is the big the biggest kick in the balls that the entire industry has
[09:25.360 --> 09:31.720]  had in the USB era is the fact that Thunderbolt looks Thunderbolt 3 looks
[09:31.720 --> 09:38.000]  exactly like USB C and in fact will kind of work but it'll only work at a much
[09:38.000 --> 09:43.800]  slower than Thunderbolt 3 speed right so anyway that's my scheme for a travel bag
[09:43.800 --> 09:48.280]  is to buy you like that colored cables for each each thing so black means my
[09:48.280 --> 09:53.160]  three-way thing with the USB a on the end gray means USB C to USB C and then
[09:53.160 --> 10:00.740]  white means USB C to lightning and it's you know one of the Apple ones all right
[10:00.740 --> 10:04.880]  so you'll just not use the Apple ones if it isn't the USB C to lightning for now
[10:04.880 --> 10:08.800]  yeah that's my new travel procedure yeah cuz that that's what happens to me is
[10:08.800 --> 10:11.840]  then I pull out the that white cable and I'm like oh this is gonna be a
[10:11.840 --> 10:17.640]  lightning to USB C and it's like no this one is lightning to USB a or it's USB C
[10:17.640 --> 10:21.640]  to USB C or something like that and it's you're right color coding is a good
[10:21.640 --> 10:28.220]  idea yeah Oh big day Mac Pro we've got a lot to talk about we usually have a lot
[10:28.220 --> 10:34.440]  to talk about but Mac Pro I was looking it up you know they were it's been so
[10:34.440 --> 10:38.240]  long since there was a new Mac Pro but the one that got me is not how many
[10:38.240 --> 10:44.040]  thousands of days it's been since the trash can came out it's so you were
[10:44.040 --> 10:48.320]  there at that roundtable that was the you know no we really do like the Mac
[10:48.320 --> 10:55.560]  yeah and that was 980 days ago wow that is 980 days between when Apple
[10:55.560 --> 11:02.640]  admitted that there would be a new Mac Pro design coming in the future and I'm
[11:02.640 --> 11:06.960]  taking orders if they ship it in 20 days they'll hit a thousand right on the nose
[11:06.960 --> 11:10.920]  you know I haven't seen when people I haven't seen people tweeting about
[11:10.920 --> 11:14.600]  people who've already ordered tweeting about dates I have a friend who ordered
[11:14.600 --> 11:20.400]  a I think he was like hitting reload because one of the funny things is
[11:20.400 --> 11:23.880]  finally we still didn't even know when the hell it was gonna go on sale then
[11:23.880 --> 11:31.880]  eventually last month at that Pro that the MacBook Pro roundtable whatever you
[11:31.880 --> 11:34.840]  want to call the dog pony show in New York yeah the thing that you and I both
[11:34.840 --> 11:39.120]  went to in New York right they said they specified it like a little bit closer
[11:39.120 --> 11:43.880]  well they said December a year no they December so we knew and then on their
[11:43.880 --> 11:47.800]  website they said this fall so it's like okay well now it's like a 21 day window
[11:47.800 --> 11:52.040]  it's gonna fall inside so then they said December and then I think Friday no
[11:52.040 --> 11:56.320]  Saturday night Saturday night of all times they announced that it would they
[11:56.320 --> 12:01.200]  would go on sale on December 10 but they didn't even give a time like when have
[12:01.200 --> 12:05.200]  they not give it a time right now the Apple website is telling me that the
[12:05.200 --> 12:10.040]  base model delivers December 19th through December 27th I don't know quite
[12:10.040 --> 12:12.720]  what that range means but they're gonna get it under the wire they're gonna get
[12:12.720 --> 12:16.000]  it under a thousand days since they just think about that though that's two years
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.520]  and eight months basically since Apple said there would be a new Mac Pro before
[12:20.520 --> 12:26.000]  that Mac Pro delivered it's been a long long time yeah I have a friend who was
[12:26.000 --> 12:30.120]  sitting there just reloading the page because he was afraid it would quickly
[12:30.120 --> 12:38.000]  get back ordered he wanted the pro display XDR hello hunter he got a
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.800]  delivery window of December 18 to 20 now I don't know if you could still get
[12:42.800 --> 12:50.400]  December 18 to 20 as we record low these five hours later but at least if you got
[12:50.400 --> 13:00.240]  one right away the display is 18 to 20 so that's a long time yeah boy yeah yeah
[13:00.240 --> 13:04.240]  it's funny it's funny that this has all happened I also think what's really
[13:04.240 --> 13:08.440]  funny about it is and I wrote a piece on macworld last week about this too which
[13:08.440 --> 13:12.560]  I think offended some people but that's fine I knew that was gonna happen but
[13:12.560 --> 13:19.040]  you know one of my points in it was the Mac Pro takes on this outsized portion
[13:19.040 --> 13:24.440]  of our our brainpower about the Mac then how it's actually used right and you
[13:24.440 --> 13:28.720]  could say that that's partially because it's been so long partially because it's
[13:28.720 --> 13:33.760]  a class of Mac that traditionally has been very very popular with a broader
[13:33.760 --> 13:37.240]  swath of users than it's really targeted at today which we could talk about yeah
[13:37.240 --> 13:41.040]  but also that it's just it's it's a symbol like of Apple's commitment to the
[13:41.040 --> 13:47.400]  Mac and that meeting that you went to 980 days ago like that was symbolic not
[13:47.400 --> 13:50.440]  just for people who actually wanted to buy a Mac Pro but like just to hear
[13:50.440 --> 13:54.280]  Apple say yes we do care yes there will be a new Mac Pro we're not putting the
[13:54.280 --> 13:58.360]  Mac out to pasture and and so we'd spend all this time talking about it and it's
[13:58.360 --> 14:02.920]  like most of us are not gonna get one but it's still important well the other
[14:02.920 --> 14:06.500]  interesting thing about that roundtable in hindsight was that I don't think the
[14:06.500 --> 14:12.440]  word wrong ever came out of their mouths but it was it wasn't even euphemistic I
[14:12.440 --> 14:17.000]  mean like the Fed I'm usually not even good at remembering quotes like this
[14:17.000 --> 14:22.280]  but the federal quote at the meeting was we painted ourselves into a thermal
[14:22.280 --> 14:28.480]  corner we're meaning with the trash can Mac Pro yeah you know effectively they
[14:28.480 --> 14:32.800]  were admitting we made him we made a wrong bet on where the future of desktop
[14:32.800 --> 14:38.320]  power computing was going and we missed out on the GPU revolution and how much
[14:38.320 --> 14:44.640]  thermal how much physical space it would need for the cards how much physical
[14:44.640 --> 14:49.360]  space it would need for the cooling etc etc and so forth it was you know sort of
[14:49.360 --> 14:52.640]  unprecedented and it was true you know it's obvious it would they made they did
[14:52.640 --> 14:57.160]  make a mistake and either they didn't care or they needed to course correct
[14:57.160 --> 15:01.480]  and they they you know they said they cared they said they'd course correct
[15:01.480 --> 15:08.800]  and in terms of one generation to the next being different I would almost say
[15:08.800 --> 15:13.640]  this is a bigger bigger difference from the trash can than the trash can was
[15:13.640 --> 15:19.840]  from the quote-unquote cheese grater I mean this one if you take the trash can
[15:19.840 --> 15:26.520]  out of history you could see an evolution right but but right a natural
[15:26.520 --> 15:29.880]  evolution you would think oh that's a natural one like in hindsight when we go
[15:29.880 --> 15:36.320]  back there's it would be you know like those that iconic t-shirt design where
[15:36.320 --> 15:39.360]  it shows evolution and there's like a fish crawling out of water and then like
[15:39.360 --> 15:42.760]  a little monkey and then like a caveman and then like a Neanderthal and then a
[15:42.760 --> 15:46.720]  man mm-hmm you know and it's like oh you could see how we went from there to
[15:46.720 --> 15:50.120]  there to there to there it would be like the trash can Mac Pro would be like if
[15:50.120 --> 15:56.840]  in between the Neanderthal and Homo sapien there was like a frog yeah what
[15:56.840 --> 16:01.400]  the heck is that and why is it in there or maybe a frog is unfair as a frog is
[16:01.400 --> 16:06.960]  too small but it's it was like a I don't know like a feral dog or a greyhound
[16:06.960 --> 16:10.920]  like a really graceful beautiful greyhound but it's like well that's
[16:10.920 --> 16:17.000]  nothing like either of those things that's really that's really bizarre it's
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.440]  it really but because this is like a beefier version of the cheese grater
[16:21.440 --> 16:27.760]  going from the trash can to this design and it's insane baseline specs and
[16:27.760 --> 16:35.040]  prices right I mean just price alone is yeah is really unprecedented and well I
[16:35.040 --> 16:40.960]  mean history it's it is I mean not if you'd look at like constant like dollar
[16:40.960 --> 16:45.840]  equivalents over time because I was looking it up like the the Mac to FX was
[16:45.840 --> 16:51.360]  in in current dollars like eight grand or something like that oh I think it was
[16:51.360 --> 16:55.520]  more than that I think it was a grant I think the Mac to FX was eight grand in
[16:55.520 --> 17:00.520]  1989 dollars oh yeah maybe you're right it's the point is that that Apple has
[17:00.520 --> 17:05.040]  been selling high-end workstations no you know you're right it was nine grand
[17:05.040 --> 17:11.200]  in 1990 when it was released that's 18 grand today right so like that was a
[17:11.200 --> 17:15.560]  base model that was the base model Apple has sold ridiculously priced computers
[17:15.560 --> 17:19.920]  it's true it goes back and forth the Mac Pro like so the thing that I keep saying
[17:19.920 --> 17:25.280]  that that some people get and some people don't is what's changed it from
[17:25.280 --> 17:29.680]  back in the day when like I had a power Mac g4 that was my primary computer for
[17:29.680 --> 17:32.720]  a long time and then I had a power Mac g5 and that was my primary computer for
[17:32.720 --> 17:38.800]  a long time but there was an era where like anybody who needed to do anything
[17:38.800 --> 17:45.200]  with any amount of stress on the Mac as a desktop would buy a tower because that
[17:45.200 --> 17:50.120]  was where the power was and I'm ax were toys I'm ax were low-end super
[17:50.120 --> 17:56.840]  compromised computers but over time the percentage of the of that like power Mac
[17:56.840 --> 18:02.080]  g4 market that actually couldn't use an iMac if this makes any sense keeps
[18:02.080 --> 18:06.280]  getting less and less and less it's like today between the iMac the iMac Pro and
[18:06.280 --> 18:10.840]  the Mac mini they're so powerful that you can get something in one of those
[18:10.840 --> 18:17.440]  products that will you know it'll satisfy 95% of users maybe maybe 98% of
[18:17.440 --> 18:20.960]  users in terms of sheer numbers and not like the money being spent and that
[18:20.960 --> 18:23.120]  doesn't mean that the smaller percentages aren't important what it
[18:23.120 --> 18:27.200]  does mean is the Mac Pro Apple has been very slowly since the introduction of
[18:27.200 --> 18:30.800]  the cheese grater Mac Pro and then with the trash can and now has been just
[18:30.800 --> 18:36.920]  ratcheting up the base of that computer and saying this is really for pros and
[18:36.920 --> 18:41.120]  like it's not today like I remember when the Intel Mac Pro came out and I
[18:41.120 --> 18:45.680]  remember when the trash can came out that we had the same conversation which
[18:45.680 --> 18:50.960]  is literally Apple is kind of pushing the prosumer who just kind of likes to
[18:50.960 --> 18:55.480]  have a pro system kind of pushing them toward other products and saying yeah
[18:55.480 --> 19:00.480]  you remember like the the trash can it was all about like like biotech and yeah
[19:00.480 --> 19:04.720]  and we're gonna be doing using these GPUs to do DNA sequencing and stuff like
[19:04.720 --> 19:09.760]  that the whole message was not you can do Photoshop on this because like the
[19:09.760 --> 19:13.960]  other systems were powerful enough for almost everybody so it's aspirational
[19:13.960 --> 19:19.000]  but like Apple has been pushing the high end the Mac Pro up into the high end for
[19:19.000 --> 19:23.440]  like a decade now at least yeah the other thing is that in the earlier
[19:23.440 --> 19:31.200]  decades it was a lot easier to understand computers in terms of this
[19:31.200 --> 19:35.000]  higher-end one versus a middle one versus a low-end one and you really
[19:35.000 --> 19:42.360]  could it is just a basic enthusiast right the general public never never
[19:42.360 --> 19:45.680]  really cared and that's why they always bought like just bought the iMac right
[19:45.680 --> 19:48.600]  why would I want to buy a separate monitor I'll buy this adorable thing
[19:48.600 --> 19:53.560]  that's all-in-one and they don't care about a G totally versus a g4 or going
[19:53.560 --> 19:56.440]  back but going back in time it was always you could just look at the CPU
[19:56.440 --> 20:04.520]  name and when this 68 Oh 30 came out in the back in the Motorola days of the 80s
[20:04.520 --> 20:12.840]  and 90s it was way faster than the 68 Oh 20s and the 68 Oh fingers were way
[20:12.840 --> 20:17.360]  faster era where we're chip model numbers were put in the names of the
[20:17.360 --> 20:22.760]  products right quadras or Oh 40s and the and the power Mac g3 and the power Mac
[20:22.760 --> 20:26.240]  g4 and g5 like literally it was this has got the new chip in it that's why it's
[20:26.240 --> 20:31.840]  called this the greatest in my opinion Macintosh of all time the SE 30 the 30
[20:31.840 --> 20:37.120]  was because it was the first SE with SE you know classic Mac style thing with
[20:37.120 --> 20:46.000]  the next 68 Oh 30 in it and then again with the once they went to power PC the
[20:46.000 --> 20:51.440]  initial ones the power you know the initial ones were still sort of named
[20:51.440 --> 20:58.960]  pre pre return of Steve Jobs but it's actually 170 180 100 my beloved my
[20:58.960 --> 21:04.240]  heretofore I think I have a new favorite Mac ever but perhaps my favorite Mac
[21:04.240 --> 21:09.120]  ever at least dollar for dollar was a power Mac 9600 that I bought right when
[21:09.120 --> 21:16.360]  I got out of college in 96 and it had been discontinued it was the power Mac
[21:16.360 --> 21:23.280]  g3s had come out I believe and I got a 9600 maxed out like with everything like
[21:23.280 --> 21:28.000]  most RAM biggest drive at like an incredible discount over what it had
[21:28.000 --> 21:35.960]  been like a few months earlier and it was my desktop for a whole bunch of
[21:35.960 --> 21:41.720]  years and it never could there was an initial promise that that those 9600
[21:41.720 --> 21:46.680]  class and back around there would I forget what chip it had but it was
[21:46.680 --> 21:51.080]  before the power PC started calling him g3s yeah it must have been a no 40 yeah
[21:51.080 --> 21:55.640]  it was a no 40 I think and there was a promise that Mac OS 10 would run on it
[21:55.640 --> 22:00.440]  and then they eventually dropped that and went like actually the baseline will
[22:00.440 --> 22:04.720]  be g3s when Mac OS 10 came out but by the time I bought it with the promise
[22:04.720 --> 22:09.680]  that hey the future so so it was so it was like a power PC like a 601 yeah 601
[22:09.680 --> 22:16.200]  something like no 604 604 oh okay all right yeah it was the yeah it was a
[22:16.200 --> 22:20.680]  power PC but not a but not a not a G right right because it was a because it
[22:20.680 --> 22:24.840]  was a power Mac and quadra yeah right so like the early but it wasn't in the G's
[22:24.840 --> 22:28.200]  and and if you weren't in a g3 you weren't gonna get to run OS 10 right but
[22:28.200 --> 22:34.680]  even before the G's g4 G you know g5 yeah the 601 was like the first one and
[22:34.680 --> 22:39.280]  there were I think there was a 603 603 yeah and there was like a 603 II and
[22:39.280 --> 22:43.600]  then yeah and then the 604 was the best of the those models and that's what the
[22:43.600 --> 22:48.360]  night my beloved 9600 had never got to run Mac OS 10 but by the time Mac OS 10
[22:48.360 --> 22:52.040]  came out I didn't want to put Mac OS 10 I wouldn't have installed it I wouldn't
[22:52.040 --> 22:58.120]  have installed it on that machine in 2001 anyway so I was at that point you
[22:58.120 --> 23:02.640]  needed the fastest possible Mac to run it very very very slowly exactly and I
[23:02.640 --> 23:07.760]  just didn't want it so that was fine beloved machine but it was very easy to
[23:07.760 --> 23:12.320]  know why I wanted a power Mac 9600 which was like a super maxed out and very
[23:12.320 --> 23:16.280]  expensive for a kid just coming out of college I forget what I spent sure
[23:16.280 --> 23:19.640]  probably I don't know three four thousand dollars something like that I
[23:19.640 --> 23:27.640]  don't know but it was a lot it was easy to tell just by the 603 versus 604 you
[23:27.640 --> 23:31.240]  know and you can't do that anymore it's it's just not the and it's been a long
[23:31.240 --> 23:36.240]  time since you could you really and you can't look at gigahertz and you know
[23:36.240 --> 23:39.920]  it's it's complicated right you can look at the like generation of Intel
[23:39.920 --> 23:43.320]  processor but with a Mac Pro it's the Xeons which are different they have a
[23:43.320 --> 23:48.080]  different profile and then you've got turbo boost versus core count right and
[23:48.080 --> 23:51.800]  that performs differently based on software that's something that happened
[23:51.800 --> 23:55.720]  about the time of the power PC transition where the idea of multiple
[23:55.720 --> 23:59.240]  processors or multiple processor cores came in and then it's like you know you
[23:59.240 --> 24:03.440]  don't even know because like if your favorite app only uses one core then the
[24:03.440 --> 24:07.480]  fastest computer you can buy it's not the fastest computer you can buy because
[24:07.480 --> 24:10.860]  you know it's faster because it's out of course and your thing doesn't use the
[24:10.860 --> 24:14.600]  course so there's no point and you just want the faster turbo boost with the one
[24:14.600 --> 24:19.140]  core and it's complicated right like so much of it is is complicated and they
[24:19.140 --> 24:21.840]  kind of sand it off and just say you don't even need to know just you know
[24:21.840 --> 24:25.680]  just don't even worry about it yeah and so you know I grew up in that those
[24:25.680 --> 24:30.000]  decades thinking either will either wishing I could afford the fastest
[24:30.000 --> 24:33.440]  possible Mac that you know whether it was called power Mac or whatever the
[24:33.440 --> 24:37.020]  name was it you know at the time from the a even from the 60 you know the
[24:37.020 --> 24:43.000]  Motorola days before that wishing I could afford a Mac to CI or dream upon
[24:43.000 --> 24:47.760]  dream you know a to FX I mean I've told this story before I don't know the SOB
[24:47.760 --> 24:51.160]  name or if I did know it I forgot it but there was one guy in the Drexel dorms
[24:51.160 --> 24:58.080]  who had a to FX and and when we played specter on in the dorms having a faster
[24:58.080 --> 25:02.400]  computer actually helped and and you know and everybody if you played
[25:02.400 --> 25:06.320]  specter you know everybody knew you turn on the vector style graphics just
[25:06.320 --> 25:11.880]  outlines because it would speed things up but this guy had a to FX so and the
[25:11.880 --> 25:15.740]  worst part is in it so we had a to FX that's you know good for him you get you
[25:15.740 --> 25:19.260]  know his parents had money if I could have my parents had offered me a
[25:19.260 --> 25:24.400]  $8,000 to FX I certainly wouldn't have taken it the worst part is the son of a
[25:24.400 --> 25:28.200]  bitch was a cheater you know he went into red there was a way to go into res
[25:28.200 --> 25:36.420]  edit and and set your specter config to have like illegal value so you're maxed
[25:36.420 --> 25:40.720]  out on all three things it was like you had like I forget the three factors
[25:40.720 --> 25:48.440]  inspector it was like speed shields armor yeah armor and there's like a
[25:48.440 --> 25:52.920]  firepower or something I don't forget what the third one was but but you'd had
[25:52.920 --> 25:56.060]  you have to allocate stuff and you could make a faster one but then you'd have
[25:56.060 --> 25:59.520]  less armor or you could make a more armored one but then you'd be slower and
[25:59.520 --> 26:04.580]  that son of a bitch made his max armor and max speed and you could tell when
[26:04.580 --> 26:07.480]  somebody was cheating like that you could tell with your absolutely and the
[26:07.480 --> 26:11.880]  son of a bitch had a Mac to FX so he already had a leg up anyway if anybody
[26:11.880 --> 26:16.360]  had from Drexel and then 1991 1992 remembers that guy's name let me know
[26:16.360 --> 26:24.120]  because I'll air it out I don't I don't take cheating no but anyway it's it I
[26:24.120 --> 26:28.440]  see what you mean no people identify with the fact that I I want the Mac Pro
[26:28.440 --> 26:31.960]  whatever it's you know yeah whatever it's called at the time and now they
[26:31.960 --> 26:36.000]  feel and I think I think there's even also there's the aesthetic aesthetic
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.120]  thing like entirely around like there's first there's my identity as a computer
[26:40.120 --> 26:44.140]  person like I'm a computer enthusiast who lived through that era and so for me
[26:44.140 --> 26:48.640]  having a tower being able to change you know change out video cards being able
[26:48.640 --> 26:51.760]  to upgrade the processor a lot of stuff which by the way nobody actually ever
[26:51.760 --> 26:56.260]  did or very few people did it was it was it was the theory that you could upgrade
[26:56.260 --> 26:59.920]  the internals but most people didn't and Apple realized that which is why Apple
[26:59.920 --> 27:03.240]  makes computers now that mostly you can't upgrade the internals and that's
[27:03.240 --> 27:07.960]  just how they have decided to do it and I also get like for some people it's not
[27:07.960 --> 27:12.100]  just the nostalgia or that just the calming feeling of knowing that it could
[27:12.100 --> 27:16.480]  be upgraded later some of it is aesthetic too which is like I like having
[27:16.480 --> 27:21.080]  a big shiny tower and a standalone monitor I like knowing that I can
[27:21.080 --> 27:24.700]  replace the computer and keep the monitor or replace the monitor and keep
[27:24.700 --> 27:29.320]  the computer like I there there are a lot of intangibles going in here that I
[27:29.320 --> 27:34.780]  totally get why people are attracted that way even though that the truth is
[27:34.780 --> 27:39.040]  that for what they want to do an iMac or an iMac Pro or a Mac Mini with an
[27:39.040 --> 27:45.240]  external monitor is probably like more than they need I get like yeah but I
[27:45.240 --> 27:51.800]  want this really cool tower I totally get it yeah that's funny though that
[27:51.800 --> 27:56.280]  that what I think is pretty good advice you probably don't need a Mac Pro is
[27:56.280 --> 28:02.640]  like your most controversial Mac world well yeah I think my first my first
[28:02.640 --> 28:06.800]  headline that I wrote that I changed was the Mac Pro is is really important and
[28:06.800 --> 28:10.360]  you shouldn't buy one which is like I actually got somebody who wrote to me
[28:10.360 --> 28:14.680]  and he said stop suppressing sales of Mac Pros we need the Mac Pro I'm like
[28:14.680 --> 28:17.680]  look the people who are gonna buy it are gonna buy it it's all the people are
[28:17.680 --> 28:21.360]  like no I don't really need it and that's like I told John Syracuse about
[28:21.360 --> 28:26.320]  this and he and his response on on his podcast was I don't need it I want it
[28:26.320 --> 28:30.260]  it's like yeah that's fine like I totally get it but it's like I think for
[28:30.260 --> 28:33.320]  most Mac users the Mac Pro is more important as a symbol it's more
[28:33.320 --> 28:36.780]  important of being part of this kind of reattachment re-engagement Apple has
[28:36.780 --> 28:40.120]  been doing since eight hundred and eighty or nine hundred and eighty days
[28:40.120 --> 28:44.400]  ago where they have done a whole bunch of stuff and we're seeing it now and
[28:44.400 --> 28:48.440]  we'll still be seeing it next year where they've kind of changed their approach
[28:48.440 --> 28:53.940]  and and are spending more time being concerned about the the kind of pro end
[28:53.940 --> 28:57.240]  of the of the market and that doesn't just mean the Mac Pro it also means the
[28:57.240 --> 29:00.920]  iMac Pro and the MacBook Pro and and like other other Mac products as well
[29:00.920 --> 29:05.480]  and that's what's you know it's important in that way even if you don't
[29:05.480 --> 29:11.120]  end up spending somewhere between six and fifty thousand dollars on a Mac Pro
[29:11.120 --> 29:16.760]  I think it still matters yeah totally all right now in addition to not telling
[29:16.760 --> 29:22.960]  us when it would go on sale and then when they finally told us what day it
[29:22.960 --> 29:30.200]  would go on sale they didn't tell us what time right now we know everything
[29:30.200 --> 29:37.040]  10 a.m. Pacific turns out no I think it was 9 a.m. person that was a 9 a.m.
[29:37.040 --> 29:40.840]  person yeah because I was I was taking my nose turn yeah I was taking my notes
[29:40.840 --> 29:46.360]  around 1215 here so I was still in my pajamas that's what I know but that's a
[29:46.360 --> 29:49.600]  little it's a little unusual because usually the Apple is a 10 a.m. Pacific
[29:49.600 --> 29:54.680]  1 p.m. Eastern Company but right you know except when it's except when you're
[29:54.680 --> 29:58.280]  pre-ordering an iPhone I guess but yeah but in addition to that they'd never
[29:58.280 --> 30:04.680]  told us anything about any pricing other than base models right and the monitor
[30:04.680 --> 30:08.600]  stand right and now we know it all and so we have so much to talk about but
[30:08.600 --> 30:12.880]  before we do so there we go that'll be a perfect perfect topic after fantastic
[30:12.880 --> 30:17.600]  after I thank our first friend of the show who've been sponsoring the show now
[30:17.600 --> 30:21.680]  for quite a bit and I like them a lot they're good company Express VPN I've
[30:21.680 --> 30:29.200]  tried Express VPN it is exactly as easy to use as they say you install it you
[30:29.200 --> 30:35.680]  tap a button you allow one of those config files to be used on your on your
[30:35.680 --> 30:42.240]  device profile and then boom all of a sudden you can go on public Wi-Fi like
[30:42.240 --> 30:47.760]  at an airport or a coffee shop or something like that or an airplane and
[30:47.760 --> 30:52.760]  all of your network data is secure without slowing your internet speed why
[30:52.760 --> 30:56.640]  should you care about encrypting all your data well one thing privacy it's
[30:56.640 --> 31:00.640]  often easy for somebody snooping on the network traffic on an open network to
[31:00.640 --> 31:05.680]  just see what's floating about and sure maybe a lot of your web traffic is over
[31:05.680 --> 31:11.160]  HTTPS no matter what even if you're on a public network but some of it isn't and
[31:11.160 --> 31:15.080]  they could just snoop right on it there's even flaws there's one called
[31:15.080 --> 31:21.880]  crack krac K that could exploit public Wi-Fi VPN protects you from all of that
[31:21.880 --> 31:26.520]  if you ever do use like Wi-Fi at a hotel or something like that you can tell you
[31:26.520 --> 31:29.720]  on a public network like when you go to airplay and there's all these other
[31:29.720 --> 31:32.440]  people around I mean some of that could be Bluetooth but some of that's just
[31:32.440 --> 31:35.400]  because they've all these people are on the same Wi-Fi network the best way to
[31:35.400 --> 31:39.440]  ensure all of your data is encrypted and can't be read by hackers or snoopers is
[31:39.440 --> 31:44.600]  using Express VPN all you need to do is download their app on your computer or
[31:44.600 --> 31:48.560]  your smartphone and then use the internet as you normally do you don't
[31:48.560 --> 31:52.320]  even know it's until you just click one button to have it turn on and you just
[31:52.320 --> 31:56.080]  use it you just use your you know check your email use Twitter you don't even
[31:56.080 --> 31:59.760]  know it's there except a little VPN icon up in the top of your screen to let you
[31:59.760 --> 32:04.000]  know wait you know that you're protected you can even use Express VPN to stream
[32:04.000 --> 32:07.560]  video content from other countries there's never any buffering or lag
[32:07.560 --> 32:12.800]  because the performance is great and you can stream in HD no problem it is the
[32:12.800 --> 32:16.480]  fastest and most reliable they are recommended as number one by review
[32:16.480 --> 32:20.200]  sites like tech radar and CNET it's a company that takes privacy and security
[32:20.200 --> 32:24.160]  to the next level they invented a technology called trusted server to
[32:24.160 --> 32:29.920]  ensure that VPN servers run from RAM with no data logs written to a server's
[32:29.920 --> 32:35.320]  hard drive even by accident can't happen if you visit my special link right now
[32:35.320 --> 32:42.760]  this is for listeners of the show Express VPN comm slash TTS you can get
[32:42.760 --> 32:48.600]  an extra three months of Express VPN service for free support the show watch
[32:48.600 --> 32:58.000]  what you want and protect yourself at Express VPN comm slash TTS all right so
[32:58.000 --> 33:03.640]  we knew the base model price five six thousand dollars let's call it five
[33:03.640 --> 33:10.280]  yep thousand nine hundred ninety nine did we know the Mac Pro rack price that
[33:10.280 --> 33:14.680]  the rack mountable version don't think so I think we just knew that it was
[33:14.680 --> 33:19.840]  going to exist right and so there's a for those you know and and that this
[33:19.840 --> 33:23.640]  wasn't a major part of the WWDC announcement it was there and they had
[33:23.640 --> 33:32.520]  the rack mounted ones in New York for us to ogle ogle ogle say ogle I don't go
[33:32.520 --> 33:39.920]  with your pronunciation ogle last month and I I immediately I looked at it I was
[33:39.920 --> 33:43.240]  like that looks great and I turned around said how much does this cost and
[33:43.240 --> 33:48.720]  they were like we're not talking about that or maybe I even got like a wolf
[33:48.720 --> 33:52.280]  check we'll check and get back to you and then we'll get back to you well I
[33:52.280 --> 33:55.960]  hundred five hundred bucks that's the answer no it's fifteen hundred it's
[33:55.960 --> 34:00.480]  signal I've got oh no you're right it's five hundred cuz it's I see these I
[34:00.480 --> 34:05.120]  eyeballed it and the five on the five nine nine nine screwed me yeah so it's
[34:05.120 --> 34:09.360]  only fifteen hundred there we go or five hundred I mean five hundred bucks just
[34:09.360 --> 34:13.320]  to get it rackable yeah I don't it's and it's a completely different config it's
[34:13.320 --> 34:16.040]  that's the thing is it's not like there's a conversion kit or something
[34:16.040 --> 34:19.680]  yeah it's just like ordering an iMac whether you want the right amount or not
[34:19.680 --> 34:24.880]  like you need to order it right with the rack mountable version and it comes that
[34:24.880 --> 34:28.520]  way but still that's cool it's like the days of the X serve right at the X serve
[34:28.520 --> 34:32.880]  rate you can put it in a rack now and nobody like like the the max stadium
[34:32.880 --> 34:37.480]  people don't need to invent a mounting system for this thing it's Apple is
[34:37.480 --> 34:41.960]  gonna if you want it with with slide it into a rack somewhere you can just buy
[34:41.960 --> 34:47.360]  it that way yeah I'll bet they're glad I know you know Brian Stuckey over there
[34:47.360 --> 34:51.720]  and it's good timing that they've changed their name and merged and become
[34:51.720 --> 34:56.200]  max stadium instead of Mac mini colo because uh-huh these are gonna be a big
[34:56.200 --> 35:02.200]  deal for them yeah it's a really neat config but I don't think but I don't
[35:02.200 --> 35:06.920]  know that the technical specs inside are identical I believe that they will be
[35:06.920 --> 35:11.320]  though that I think that the base model Mac Pro rack or whatever we're gonna
[35:11.320 --> 35:19.520]  call it rack Mac Pro rack Mac pack rat the rat pack I don't know is a rack pro
[35:19.520 --> 35:24.560]  you just pay a $500 premium just for the right mounted version but we don't know
[35:24.560 --> 35:27.120]  because it's not available yet which means you can't click there and then
[35:27.120 --> 35:30.400]  price it right figure we don't know because it's not not there yet coming
[35:30.400 --> 35:35.080]  soon I think that's what they said that's my notes my notes say coming soon
[35:35.080 --> 35:40.760]  yeah well I laugh because like you said it's you know the Mac Pro was coming
[35:40.760 --> 35:45.120]  well they never said coming soon but you know we waited 980 days for any of this
[35:45.120 --> 35:52.800]  who knows what coming soon means so here's the processor upgrade story
[35:52.800 --> 36:00.400]  first step up is a thousand dollars mm-hmm that's from going from so the
[36:00.400 --> 36:10.520]  base model is an 8 core the next one is 12 core that's a thousand bucks the 16
[36:10.520 --> 36:20.880]  core $2,000 24 or $6,000 and the 28 core Intel Xeon W processor with turbo boost
[36:20.880 --> 36:28.800]  up to 4.4 gigahertz $7,000 now the thing's pretty good pretty good deal
[36:28.800 --> 36:32.320]  there you get an extra four cores for just another grant there so the thing
[36:32.320 --> 36:36.080]  one thing I didn't realize I don't know if you could know if people who
[36:36.080 --> 36:39.520]  understand like the Xeon roadmap was like oh yeah that's you know that's the
[36:39.520 --> 36:45.080]  way it is but you you need to get the 24 core or 28 core ones which again are a
[36:45.080 --> 36:53.080]  $6,000 or $7,000 upgrade if you want to get the 1.5 terabyte of RAM option right
[36:53.080 --> 36:59.040]  right so to pay $25,000 for RAM you need to first pay six or seven thousand
[36:59.040 --> 37:03.600]  dollars for processor right so it you know you know I don't know what the
[37:03.600 --> 37:08.520]  correlation is between people who really need 1.5 terabytes of RAM and people who
[37:08.520 --> 37:16.120]  really need more than 16 cores but that's you know kind of a bummer and who
[37:16.120 --> 37:21.880]  knows I don't know if that is a technical constraint I would kind of
[37:21.880 --> 37:25.960]  hope it is you know that that that's the way these you know the only those
[37:25.960 --> 37:31.840]  chipsets support that much RAM and it is a big jump up right so the first two
[37:31.840 --> 37:38.720]  steps 1000 and 2000 and then the next one is 6,000 going from 16 to 24 is a
[37:38.720 --> 37:43.760]  $4,000 jump whereas adding four cores to go from 12 to 16 is only a thousand
[37:43.760 --> 37:50.040]  right so if you're thinking well every four cores is a thousand to go from 16
[37:50.040 --> 37:54.320]  to 24 you would think it'd be four thousand but it's not it's six thousand
[37:54.320 --> 37:58.920]  so would that sort of makes me think that those chips must be they must be
[37:58.920 --> 38:04.080]  more expensive and that's why they're the ones that support 1.5 terabytes
[38:04.200 --> 38:13.760]  right memory now this is actually I spec this out so the one everybody wants to
[38:13.760 --> 38:25.560]  know about is the 1.5 terabytes that's $25,000 upgrade 768 is 10,000 but if you
[38:25.560 --> 38:32.120]  get 768 but instead of using all 12 RAM slats slots for 64 gigabyte chips
[38:32.120 --> 38:39.480]  instead only use six of them at 128 each that's 14,000 so that's the those 128
[38:39.480 --> 38:46.000]  chips are the ones you need to get the maximum 1.5 terabytes so one of the
[38:46.000 --> 38:49.560]  things that stuck out to me is that the 1.5 terabyte option is actually a pretty
[38:49.560 --> 38:55.400]  good deal compared to the half as much using the same chips right so the
[38:55.400 --> 38:58.200]  it's like three grand right off the top there yeah but if you buy them in bulk
[38:58.200 --> 39:02.960]  yeah it would be you'd think it would be $28,000 you would just double the 14 but
[39:02.960 --> 39:07.640]  instead you only have to pay $25,000 say I want to discount you know it's a
[39:07.640 --> 39:17.380]  bargain I priced it out so you have to to do the math and to be fair it they
[39:17.380 --> 39:22.600]  don't really tell you how much it costs for the RAM it's all based on how much
[39:22.600 --> 39:28.240]  more it costs than the base model of 32 gigabytes right right everything is
[39:28.240 --> 39:34.960]  beginning at $59.99 and and with 32 gigs of RAM and then you adjust right word
[39:34.960 --> 39:42.040]  and so when you go from 32 to 48 the plus $300 you pay for that you're really
[39:42.040 --> 39:47.080]  only yours you could do the math you're really only spending $300 for 16 more
[39:47.080 --> 39:53.000]  gigabytes of RAM but if you're talking about 768 gigabytes or 1.5 terabytes
[39:53.000 --> 39:57.840]  that the initial whatever the cost of 32 gigs of RAM doesn't isn't really a
[39:57.840 --> 40:06.200]  factor but if you look at the price per gigabyte over 32 the prices are actually
[40:06.200 --> 40:13.120]  lower for this Mac Pro than they are for the iMac Pro there it's you know it's
[40:13.120 --> 40:19.040]  close but it's about like my going down the list I did the math here it's and
[40:19.040 --> 40:23.880]  it's oddly inconsistent eighteen point seven five dollars per gigabyte fifteen
[40:23.880 --> 40:29.480]  point six two five eighteen point seven five seventeen nineteen thirteen point
[40:29.480 --> 40:36.920]  four six and then the big one is sixteen point six two dollars per gigabyte over
[40:36.920 --> 40:44.600]  32 with the iMac Pro the 64 is kind of a bargain if you go to 64 gigabytes on
[40:44.600 --> 40:49.360]  iMac Pro you're only paying twelve point five dollars per gigabyte over 32 but
[40:49.360 --> 40:56.040]  then the next two options for the iMac Pro 128 and 256 are 21 and 23 dollars
[40:56.040 --> 41:01.560]  which is more than any of the Mac Pro configs so you know they're not like
[41:01.560 --> 41:09.200]  really they're not price gouging more than they do with the iMac Pro right and
[41:09.200 --> 41:14.240]  I wonder if that partially is what the configuration is in the iMac Pro and if
[41:14.240 --> 41:19.080]  it's if you know they have they only have a couple of slots so that they have
[41:19.080 --> 41:22.040]  to fill them I don't know I don't remember all the details because that
[41:22.040 --> 41:26.600]  was a couple years ago when the iMac Pro came out but you know and it's it is
[41:26.600 --> 41:30.360]  fascinating to think about how they how they price all this stuff because on one
[41:30.360 --> 41:33.720]  level you know they're looking at the component prices and figuring out what
[41:33.720 --> 41:38.000]  their margin is they're probably also thinking that you make a certain margin
[41:38.000 --> 41:41.480]  on the you know getting in the door with the Mac Pro but then every step above
[41:41.480 --> 41:45.640]  that you want to increase your margin or at least maintain your margin they they
[41:45.640 --> 41:51.400]  know that the higher end you go probably the more you can afford to spend more
[41:51.400 --> 41:55.520]  money because this is this is a this is the thing when people are outraged like
[41:55.520 --> 41:58.440]  today's a great the day that this comes out a great day for people to be
[41:58.440 --> 42:01.520]  outraged by how expensive this thing is and you can very easily price it up to
[42:01.520 --> 42:07.000]  50 grand but you know in the professional workstation market like
[42:07.000 --> 42:10.920]  consumer consumer economics kind of don't apply it's a very different kind
[42:10.920 --> 42:16.080]  of game and so you know the the I would imagine that the techniques you take as
[42:16.080 --> 42:19.840]  Apple in terms of pricing this thing and figuring out what your profit margins
[42:19.840 --> 42:24.080]  are probably are a different kind of game than you would play with a consumer
[42:24.080 --> 42:28.240]  product yeah yeah I would say certainly the numbers are different but I would
[42:28.240 --> 42:31.240]  imagine that they'd like the margin calculations because you know on a
[42:31.240 --> 42:34.240]  consumer good you're probably like well you know above a certain point we're
[42:34.240 --> 42:37.000]  gonna just depress sales and people are gonna are not gonna want it and so we
[42:37.000 --> 42:40.520]  got a limit what our maximum is and we got a step that along the way whereas I
[42:40.520 --> 42:43.920]  look at this Mac Pro and I think you know if somebody wants to buy 1.5
[42:43.920 --> 42:48.240]  terabytes let's let's let's do it like let's make a lot of money from those
[42:48.240 --> 42:53.000]  people because they obviously money is no object to a certain point that they're
[42:53.000 --> 42:58.560]  they're happy to drop 25 grand in order to get that RAM so let's make a profit
[42:58.560 --> 43:03.520]  but you know but it's interesting to me that it you know the dollar per
[43:03.520 --> 43:06.960]  gigabyte doesn't really go up exponentially as you get to the top and
[43:06.960 --> 43:11.280]  in fact goes down a little bit the ones that are the worst deal are the 48 and
[43:11.280 --> 43:21.640]  192 I thought it was a little weird that the the increments aren't in 32s that
[43:21.640 --> 43:31.120]  instead of 32 64 128 256 512 1024 those numbers that you know we've all just
[43:31.120 --> 43:38.040]  know the powers to it it's off because because of the slot population right so
[43:38.040 --> 43:44.840]  all the all the all the modules are 8 16 32 64 128 right but then it's like four
[43:44.840 --> 43:49.720]  of this one six of this one twelve that what all of the configs are either six
[43:49.720 --> 43:53.200]  six of this one or twelve of that one they're all either six or twelve half
[43:53.200 --> 43:57.960]  the slots filled or all the slots filled except for the base model which is four
[43:57.960 --> 44:03.000]  and so my question is and I don't know the answer I actually tried to research
[44:03.000 --> 44:07.020]  it today and came up short because I'm so far out of this world is I have no
[44:07.020 --> 44:12.640]  idea since you can use four and then you can use six can you also use eight if
[44:12.640 --> 44:17.520]  you yourself go out and buy the RAM and open the case you know do the thing you
[44:17.520 --> 44:20.240]  know because who doesn't want to if you get it you got to open the even if you
[44:20.240 --> 44:23.520]  don't want to add RAM or anything you got to open the case and just look at it
[44:23.520 --> 44:27.600]  right so if you're gonna add RAM yourself can you use I mean of course
[44:27.600 --> 44:31.160]  you have to have even pairs you're not gonna be able to put seven right but
[44:31.160 --> 44:36.120]  could you make an eight chip config yourself or a ten check because they're
[44:36.120 --> 44:39.360]  not selling eights or eights or tens here actually this goes back to Apple's
[44:39.360 --> 44:43.080]  profit margin on these things too and that's got to be a calculation right is
[44:43.080 --> 44:49.320]  this is an extremely upgradable expandable computer so at some point the
[44:49.320 --> 44:54.920]  convenience of getting it pre-populated with the RAM that you want is going to
[44:54.920 --> 45:00.440]  be outweighed by overpricing the RAM right because unlike other Apple systems
[45:00.440 --> 45:05.400]  that are out there it's going to be real easy to install more RAM in this thing
[45:05.400 --> 45:12.120]  and presumably third parties will sell you ddr4 ECC memory for not cheap but
[45:12.120 --> 45:15.800]  for maybe cheaper than Apple if Apple marks it up too much so that's you know
[45:15.800 --> 45:19.960]  that that's kind of fast like do you buy this with 1.5 terabytes of RAM in it or
[45:19.960 --> 45:24.600]  do you say you know I'm let's wait and see what that market bears because if
[45:24.600 --> 45:30.200]  if you could get that those 12 128 for 20 grand or for 15 grand instead of for
[45:30.200 --> 45:33.800]  25 maybe it's worth it maybe it's not I don't know well and let's face it I
[45:33.800 --> 45:37.560]  don't expect this machine to be updated in a while right the Xeon and the Xeon
[45:37.560 --> 45:41.560]  chips just don't get updated in a long time the iMac Pro still hasn't gotten in
[45:41.560 --> 45:49.560]  a CPU update and that's two years old and it's not yeah it's not for a lack of
[45:49.800 --> 45:54.760]  Apple's effort I don't think from everything I can see about the market
[45:54.760 --> 45:58.360]  it's because there's no Xeon class chips that would fit in those thermal
[45:58.360 --> 46:04.680]  constraints that have come out since then and I think given their newfound
[46:04.680 --> 46:09.000]  commitment to the pro market which I think is sincere I think as soon as
[46:09.000 --> 46:13.320]  those some Xeon chips that would make for a nice update to the iMac Pro I
[46:13.320 --> 46:17.240]  think soon thereafter iMac pros with them will come out and wouldn't be even
[46:17.240 --> 46:22.840]  be surprised if if the iMac Pro is the first machines to come out with them it
[46:22.840 --> 46:27.240]  would wouldn't surprise me also because the I know we're gonna get to the pro
[46:27.240 --> 46:33.080]  display XDR later but one interesting quirk about it is that iMac Pro is not
[46:33.080 --> 46:37.080]  supported by that monitor so it may be a thing where you would think at one point
[46:37.080 --> 46:40.520]  Apple is going to want to do a processor update but also a graphics card update
[46:40.520 --> 46:44.120]  so that they can sell an iMac Pro that'll work with a pro display XDR yeah
[46:44.120 --> 46:53.320]  you would definitely think so so I you know I think that's coming but I don't
[46:53.320 --> 46:59.800]  expect this machine this initial new Mac Pro to be updated in quite a long time I
[46:59.800 --> 47:03.240]  mean you know maybe a year if everything goes great and Intel gets their act
[47:03.240 --> 47:06.680]  together and has a solid roadmap but I wouldn't be surprised if it goes more
[47:06.680 --> 47:11.720]  than a year and that's just the nature of these chips and so what I'm trying to
[47:11.720 --> 47:17.160]  get to when we're talking about RAM is 12 months from now this might still be
[47:17.160 --> 47:25.240]  the Mac Pro and the market price for DDR4 ECC RAM might be significantly
[47:25.240 --> 47:30.760]  lower and it would might make a lot more might make obvious sense to just buy the
[47:30.760 --> 47:35.640]  base model throw out just take out the 32 gigs they give you throw it out and
[47:35.640 --> 47:41.560]  put your own 12 128 gigabyte DDR chips in there for less than $25,000 I think
[47:41.560 --> 47:47.160]  there's a good question about how this how this ages because it's so modular
[47:47.160 --> 47:51.480]  that you know Apple could keep it you know keep it as this configuration for a
[47:51.480 --> 47:56.040]  long time especially if the Xeons that just you know they're they're relatively
[47:56.040 --> 47:58.680]  young and there's not going to be another generation for a while and they
[47:58.680 --> 48:03.400]  just kind of keep them in there but if new graphics cards come out yeah you
[48:03.400 --> 48:07.560]  know if if any of the other details if they release another you know they do a
[48:07.560 --> 48:12.040]  different kind of afterburner card or or something like that like they can add
[48:12.040 --> 48:17.000]  pieces to the configurator without like changing the computer but it becomes
[48:17.000 --> 48:21.400]  over time it becomes a different computer or changing the base model and
[48:21.400 --> 48:25.480]  I expect them to do that actually because they have shown in the past two
[48:25.480 --> 48:31.960]  years they have shown a willingness to upgrade machines mid-cycle with just
[48:31.960 --> 48:39.080]  graphics card updates right MacBook Pros got build to order graphics updates was
[48:39.080 --> 48:44.200]  that it was a year ago right it was when they held that event at at Brooklyn at
[48:44.200 --> 48:49.000]  the Brooklyn Academy of Music they you know quietly announced and I say
[48:49.000 --> 48:52.760]  quietly not because you know people use that word in the press to mean semi
[48:52.760 --> 48:55.960]  hidden wasn't something they were trying to hide it just wasn't part of the show
[48:55.960 --> 49:00.120]  because they were wanted to talk about the new MacBook Air that was finally
[49:00.120 --> 49:03.480]  retina etc etc but one of the announcements that day was that they had
[49:03.480 --> 49:08.120]  like new build to order options to get faster Radeon graphics and MacBook Pros
[49:08.120 --> 49:12.240]  without any other updates to the machine so if they'll do it for MacBook Pros why
[49:12.240 --> 49:17.160]  wouldn't they do it with the Mac Pro yeah exactly they've shown everybody got
[49:17.160 --> 49:24.160]  really upset when the MacBook Pro went what a year and a month between updates
[49:24.160 --> 49:28.640]  but like they have shown that on average as this annual processor update cycle
[49:28.640 --> 49:33.040]  happens they are throwing updates in that's part of that guarantee or
[49:33.040 --> 49:37.080]  whatever they promised that they made 980 days ago and I think they've
[49:37.080 --> 49:41.640]  delivered on it so I would imagine that as new tech happens that will be
[49:41.640 --> 49:45.040]  applicable for the Mac Pro they'll stick it in there and the beauty of that is
[49:45.040 --> 49:50.880]  that because it's a modular Mac they don't need to qualify it as a new model
[49:50.880 --> 49:54.920]  and you're right all they need to do is say oh new graphics card came out here's
[49:54.920 --> 49:58.880]  the Mac Pro configuration yeah go right and then that's it they don't need to
[49:58.880 --> 50:03.720]  say please wait three months and then we'll introduce a new 2021 Mac Pro like
[50:03.720 --> 50:06.640]  they don't have to do that right there's certainly things that people can complain
[50:06.640 --> 50:10.920]  about which primarily like starting price for this Mac Pro but one thing
[50:10.920 --> 50:16.400]  that I can't see how anybody could deny is that when they said 980 some days ago
[50:16.400 --> 50:21.280]  that it would be a modular design this is a very much this is the day I don't
[50:21.280 --> 50:25.440]  see how you could hope for a more modular design it it's arguably more
[50:25.440 --> 50:31.960]  modular than any Mac has ever been any Mac yeah so all right let's go on to
[50:31.960 --> 50:38.520]  storage they've got four storage options today for 20 to 56 one terabyte that's a
[50:38.520 --> 50:45.080]  plus 400 two terabytes plus eight hundred four terabytes SSD 1400 the
[50:45.080 --> 50:50.760]  eight terabyte this is curious to me because you can buy a MacBook Pro a 16
[50:50.760 --> 50:55.400]  inch MacBook Pro with a terabytes today but you can't it's marked marked as
[50:55.400 --> 51:08.160]  coming soon for the Mac Pro I that's that seems odd to me I mean I I you know
[51:08.160 --> 51:11.360]  I don't understand you know I'm sure that there is a perfectly reasonable
[51:11.360 --> 51:19.240]  operations explanation for it and but anyway those upgrade prices given the
[51:19.240 --> 51:24.480]  starting prices are very much in line they're exactly the same they're not
[51:24.480 --> 51:29.960]  charging more for SSD storage on the Mac Pro so based on the price of the
[51:29.960 --> 51:35.120]  MacBook Pro we can I I would bet money that the upgrade price to get the eight
[51:35.120 --> 51:41.080]  terabyte will be plus 2600 and that's yeah it makes makes sense that's a lot
[51:41.080 --> 51:46.280]  for I think that's a lot for a disc but it there is eight terabytes of SSD is
[51:46.280 --> 51:51.280]  unprecedented the Apple said a month ago when they when they introduced the 16
[51:51.280 --> 51:55.840]  inch MacBook Pro that as far as they're aware and eight this eight terabyte SSD
[51:55.840 --> 52:01.520]  drive is the first in the industry and nobody else is denied that since so it's
[52:01.520 --> 52:06.400]  you know the best in the industry yeah if there's a if there's a criticism that
[52:06.400 --> 52:10.080]  I understand about the Mac Pro it's that some of its specs are actually lower
[52:10.080 --> 52:14.160]  than the base model iMac Pro for the same price or for a thousand dollars
[52:14.160 --> 52:18.080]  less actually and the SSD is the example like the iMac Pro ships with a one
[52:18.080 --> 52:23.400]  terabyte SSD and this thing starts at 256 and the the the argument I've gotten
[52:23.400 --> 52:29.640]  and I think this is why they did it this way is a lot of customers of this
[52:29.640 --> 52:35.200]  product don't want a large amount of internal SSD because these things a lot
[52:35.200 --> 52:38.840]  of them are going to be put in places where they're going to get wired into a
[52:38.840 --> 52:43.720]  giant storage network and they don't really need internal storage for those
[52:43.720 --> 52:48.240]  that because they've got high-end pro storage that they're attached to and so
[52:48.240 --> 52:51.160]  they're like okay you don't need to buy it with a lot of storage a regular
[52:51.160 --> 52:55.400]  standalone person a an independent filmmaker who does all their work on one
[52:55.400 --> 52:59.200]  of these and is gonna put it on their desk they're there they might need more
[52:59.200 --> 53:02.320]  storage although even then they probably got a high-speed storage solution of
[53:02.320 --> 53:06.640]  their own just looking at the Twitter feed today from our you know mutual
[53:06.640 --> 53:10.720]  friends of ours who are developers who are in the market for it because
[53:10.720 --> 53:14.640]  developers clearly are people who can take advantage of this compiling stuff
[53:14.640 --> 53:19.260]  in Xcode takes time and sure as everybody knows if they know any
[53:19.260 --> 53:23.000]  developer friends if you're writing in Swift which a lot of developers really
[53:23.000 --> 53:29.360]  like to do but it takes more time takes a lot more time and you're sitting there
[53:29.360 --> 53:32.520]  waiting for every time you make a change you got to sit there and wait it's a
[53:32.520 --> 53:37.680]  huge productivity suck it it really is I actually have experienced this in the
[53:37.680 --> 53:44.000]  last week or two myself as there's this app that my friend will Haynes has made
[53:44.000 --> 53:50.360]  called ketoba it is I don't know if you know I linked to it a while ago but
[53:50.360 --> 53:57.120]  basically it's a little it's an iOS app that lets you it's a dictionary app for
[53:57.120 --> 54:02.400]  iOS and it's very simple interface you do lookups but the trick is is that the
[54:02.400 --> 54:06.360]  dictionary it uses is the built-in iOS system dictionary the new American
[54:06.360 --> 54:11.040]  Heritage Dictionary and the new American Heritage writers thesaurus and any other
[54:11.040 --> 54:15.200]  system dictionaries that you're allowed to you can download in iOS when you do a
[54:15.200 --> 54:21.000]  look up in any app it's not available in the App Store because there's an App
[54:21.000 --> 54:27.200]  Store rule that you can't use the system dictionary to make a dictionary app and
[54:27.200 --> 54:31.080]  you might think well that's a strange rule and I don't know the reason for the
[54:31.080 --> 54:35.400]  rule but I strongly suspect it's the the obvious one if you think about it which
[54:35.400 --> 54:41.480]  is that they got a better licensing deal from new American to include it then
[54:41.480 --> 54:44.920]  they would have if they didn't include the rule that you can't make a dictionary
[54:44.920 --> 54:49.760]  app that you can only use it for these lookups but it's a great app and will
[54:49.760 --> 54:54.360]  Haynes is working on an update to it and a friend of the show and your mutual
[54:54.360 --> 54:59.680]  friend Craig Hockenberry he of the little very large fleshy palm has been
[54:59.680 --> 55:03.880]  contributing to it we've got a great update in the works anyway you get it on
[55:03.880 --> 55:08.200]  github it's open source so we can't put it in the App Store but we can make it
[55:08.200 --> 55:12.240]  open source and you can download but anyway I've been I haven't contributed
[55:12.240 --> 55:16.440]  anything other than my interface feedback but to play along and to use it
[55:16.440 --> 55:21.000]  I'm you know playing along and updating it via git pulling down changes
[55:21.000 --> 55:26.000]  compiling it and installing it on my iPad and my iPhone and stuff and so I
[55:26.000 --> 55:32.900]  know how slow Xcode can be for what is truly a very small app it is a really
[55:32.900 --> 55:38.320]  really really really small app because the bulk of it is the the stuff that's
[55:38.320 --> 55:44.180]  the built-in dictionary panel and stuff like that it's it's slow and that's for
[55:44.180 --> 55:48.480]  a really really small app and I even know I'd the other thing too I noticed
[55:48.480 --> 55:52.940]  the difference going from my four or five four year old 13 inch MacBook Pro
[55:52.940 --> 55:59.200]  to this 15 inch 16 inch there you go again 15 16 inch brand new Mac 15 plus
[55:59.200 --> 56:04.120]  one it is it's it's it's one of the few things where I really notice holy crap
[56:04.120 --> 56:08.760]  this thing is much faster like the two things where I notice it are launching
[56:08.760 --> 56:14.560]  apps cold where at this point the 16 inch MacBook Pro when you launch an app
[56:14.560 --> 56:18.560]  it's like I just launched the the official Twitter for Mac app today to
[56:18.560 --> 56:22.080]  see something and I was like holy crap I didn't know I had that running already
[56:22.080 --> 56:26.000]  but it wasn't running already it launches so fast that it it's
[56:26.000 --> 56:31.080]  indistinguishable to the naked eye from an app that isn't running Xcode is one
[56:31.080 --> 56:34.880]  of those things there's a very long aside to say developers want definitely
[56:34.880 --> 56:40.360]  might want the Mac Pro and if they do they're they're not going to want 256
[56:40.360 --> 56:46.240]  gigabytes in their startup drive I mean again I'm with you I don't I think it's
[56:46.240 --> 56:49.640]  right that the base model offers it because I think there are use cases
[56:49.640 --> 56:55.560]  where that makes sense and it doesn't make sense to charge them a $400
[56:55.560 --> 57:00.440]  premium to start at one terabyte but basically I and I think you made the
[57:00.440 --> 57:04.960]  same point but I'll make it again if you're going to use this as a personal
[57:04.960 --> 57:10.000]  workstation whatever your use is visual effects high-end photography video
[57:10.000 --> 57:15.000]  editing software development and Xcode you don't want the base model of
[57:15.000 --> 57:21.160]  anything there's no base the base config isn't good for you in any way it's and
[57:21.160 --> 57:27.720]  including storage yeah I mean I don't know the the the processor might be the
[57:27.720 --> 57:34.240]  memory could be the graphics card could be graphics card graphics cards storage
[57:34.240 --> 57:39.320]  I'd say very clearly like that base storage is not a real number in fact
[57:39.320 --> 57:42.920]  other than that they want to be under six grand the truth is that should be a
[57:42.920 --> 57:48.400]  minus four hundred off of a base price of sixty three ninety nine because the
[57:48.400 --> 57:53.280]  truth is if you unless you're plugging it into a storage network where you have
[57:53.280 --> 57:57.720]  very large high-speed storage elsewhere and you're just using it as a boot drive
[57:57.720 --> 58:03.340]  you don't want a 256 SSD like you or you're buying or you're installing a
[58:03.340 --> 58:07.120]  raid like there are raids available for this thing where you can plug in for
[58:07.120 --> 58:11.720]  spinning discs and have a fast raid internally like but if you're just going
[58:11.720 --> 58:15.360]  by the internal storage 256 is not enough so if you're if you're that
[58:15.360 --> 58:20.280]  person you're gonna be adding on just right out of the game let me revise my
[58:20.280 --> 58:24.280]  comment I don't think I think you're right crap in fact I know someone who
[58:24.280 --> 58:28.760]  just ordered one today who did get the base graphics because what he does isn't
[58:28.760 --> 58:32.640]  graphics related at all so graphics is probably one where a lot of developers
[58:32.640 --> 58:37.600]  in particular might be just fine with the base graphics you may not want to
[58:37.600 --> 58:41.120]  upgrade everything from the base model but there's got to be something there's
[58:41.120 --> 58:44.880]  something that's the nature of your work that you need more than the base model
[58:44.880 --> 58:50.320]  and I suspect for almost everybody RAM is part of it I mean 32 gigabytes table
[58:50.320 --> 58:57.600]  stakes these days it's possible the processor might be it's something you
[58:57.600 --> 59:03.320]  could deal with but it's hard to say but something depends on what you need I
[59:03.320 --> 59:09.880]  mean it my feeling so I bought an iMac Pro two years ago and I bought the base
[59:09.880 --> 59:13.720]  model and I had a bunch of people like you know Marco was talking about how you
[59:13.720 --> 59:17.400]  know the 10 core is the sweet spot and I think James Thompson got the 10 core and
[59:17.400 --> 59:23.480]  you know but I got the base model and my reasoning was I barely need this
[59:23.480 --> 59:27.800]  computer right like so for me it was I do enough with the audio plugins and
[59:27.800 --> 59:33.440]  stuff where I I can and I've been very happy with it I use an iMac Pro but
[59:33.440 --> 59:37.760]  anything beyond this is like I was already pushing it like this is no no
[59:37.760 --> 59:40.800]  further and I can see a lot of people who look at this I mean we've been
[59:40.800 --> 59:45.080]  talking about how high the base price is but there's gonna be a lot of people in
[59:45.080 --> 59:49.200]  there is like I really want it it's already overkill I don't need to kill it
[59:49.200 --> 59:53.320]  anymore and the base is fine for them but I think a lot of people are gonna be
[59:53.320 --> 59:58.160]  who really have those higher-end needs are gonna do just what Marco and a bunch
[59:58.160 --> 01:00:01.480]  of other people we know did two years ago with the iMac Pro we can start to do
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:05.720]  the math of like adding these cores and what's the best like landing spot in
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:09.760]  terms of price and performance as you add cores to whatever it is that you do
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.880]  in your job and they may you know I don't know what the answer is gonna be
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.760]  but I would imagine in the next few weeks we're gonna have somebody say you
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:20.320]  know the 12 core is really where it's at or the 16 core and and you know we'll
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:23.880]  find out that but for there's gonna be a big chunk of people are like look I
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:28.720]  already shouldn't buy this computer so I'm gonna get the base model but maybe
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:32.040]  not the storage don't don't do that don't do the 256 SSD there's nothing
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:35.520]  worse than buying a $6,000 computer and then not having enough room to put your
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:41.880]  software on it because the SSD is too small don't do that it's all right next
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:49.000]  step Apple afterburner $2,000 I don't really know what the hell this thing is
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.840]  I know what it does it's you know like for vector computation and stuff it
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:58.880]  sounds fascinating see I feel like this is like the pro res video in code so
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:03.200]  like I was watching MKB HD's video today and he said you know I don't work in pro
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:07.360]  res I'm working in this other format and so I haven't tested this yet so it's
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:10.880]  like a very much a like an Apple Final Cut Pro workflow of like you're using
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:15.240]  pro res which was which is super intensive and this is a programmable
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:18.000]  card right that's one of the things we learned in June is that you know
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.520]  theoretically this could be programmed to do other things it's basically a
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:25.200]  programmable card that's been programmed to be this pro res thing but like if
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:29.880]  you're a video pro who has a pro res based workflow you plug this thing in
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:37.880]  and your life is better that's basically the story yeah I can't wait I feel like
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:40.440]  it's the sort of thing that can make for some great demos I can't wait to see
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:45.320]  what people do with it yep two thousand bucks yeah there's gonna be somebody out
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:48.480]  there who does who has I haven't seen it yet but there's gonna be some somebody
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:52.400]  out there with a pro res workflow who's gonna say oh this used to take ten
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:55.960]  minutes and now it takes one minute or whatever I also think this is the sort
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:02:00.640]  of thing too that we'll get because it's all Apple technology Apple's got like
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:05.040]  complete control of what's going on in here it's not up to Radeon and AMD and
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:10.760]  it's not up certainly not up to Intel so I think with Apple's internal chip team
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:15.120]  I wouldn't be surprised if the Apple afterburner card gets updated on a
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:19.640]  twelve-month basis like clockwork you know that like the way the a series
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:24.320]  chips do and that for $2,000 next year there'll be an Apple afterburner card
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:29.560]  that like doubles the performance or something you know like that and it'll
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:33.080]  still be to be on the software side of it is intriguing because it's
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:36.320]  programmable so it could also be that in six months or a year they come out and
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:40.300]  say the afterburner can also do this other thing if you want it to and you
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:44.600]  just run this software and it reprograms the card yeah and so at the exact same
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:49.080]  exactly that's the programmable nature of it and so like the MKB HD thing like
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:53.560]  maybe you're using some other format other than ProRes and all of a sudden oh
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:59.020]  well your format now can encode ten times faster to huge huge potential
[01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:04.960]  upside there for video people and who knows what other use cases yeah here we
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:14.480]  come to my favorite feeder wheels it's so that here's the best part here's the
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:18.520]  best part the wheels are not like casters that you stick on the bottom
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:22.720]  which wouldn't be cheaper you would think this is again just like we were
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:28.200]  saying about the rack mounted like there are two stainless steel frames for the
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:32.920]  Mac Pro there's the one with feet and there's the one with wheels and you have
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:37.220]  to pick and if you get the one with wheels it's an extra 400 bucks which is
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:42.340]  $100 a wheel you called it I want to applaud you for doing this because you
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:47.640]  did the what's the over-under and what's it gonna cost and I always say find out
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:51.680]  what you're willing to pay then push it up to where it's gonna be painful but
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.160]  you're willing to pay it then push it up from there and then round it upward and
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:59.120]  that's what Apple will charge you for whatever it is and it's $400 for the
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:06.400]  wheel frame right so my my guess and you know you could say well I guess $3.99
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.460]  that was my guess so what I did last night on Twitter is I thought it'd be
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:14.080]  fun I like to gamble and and when you gamble on football and basketball a lot
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:17.720]  of times you can bet on what's called the over-under and the over-under is
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:23.120]  there's a number and for a football game and let's say it's 46 points and if you
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:26.680]  bet the over you're betting that the combined score of the two teams will be
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:32.180]  over 46 and if you bet the under you're betting the combined score is under so
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:37.680]  the over-under on this would be I set the over-under last night at 349 and I
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:42.680]  think I didn't I didn't do it as a Twitter poll because I use tweet bot and
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:47.560]  most of my friends either use tweet bot or Twitter if ik and third party can see
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:50.860]  polls can't see him and Twitter if ik does some really clever stuff to
[01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:55.720]  identify if it thinks it's a poll and sort of redirects you to like a web view
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:59.240]  so you can do it but I just I'm not into the poll thing because it's not
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:02.640]  available to third-party clients and so I don't have an exact answer I probably
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:07.160]  should have you know when I have done polls in the past I say I say to help my
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:12.320]  friends my fellow Twitter if ik users this is a Twitter poll go look at this
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:18.080]  tweet and in the web app yep I should have done that to see what people bet
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:24.240]  but eyeballing my replies I set the over-under at 349 and I I think the
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:31.440]  under one most people seem to be betting in the $200 range for a set of four
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:35.760]  wheels and you know there were others who were over but and then I tweeted
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:40.440]  again and said that was just where I set the over-under to try to get people you
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:44.240]  know you said the if you're the bookie setting the number you don't want to you
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.680]  don't put the number that you think it's going to be you put the number that you
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:52.320]  think will get half of the people to bet under and have to bet over and you the
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:56.760]  bookie come out ahead because if you get half on one side and half on the other
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:02.160]  you collect a big a 10% big from all the losers and you don't have to pay a big
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:07.620]  to the winners that's how the bookies come out ahead so generally that number
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:11.680]  is close to what they think the actual over-under will be but it's not
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:15.600]  necessarily the same so my over-under was 349 to try to get people on both
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:21.040]  sides guessing on Twitter but my my guess was 399 so I was almost spot-on
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:25.600]  yeah I think so and and I think you did a good job I think you set the
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:29.040]  over-under pretty well because I think there were you know actually you could
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:33.200]  have even said it lower I think because I think they're really to to schools of
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:37.480]  thought on this which is it'll either be not nearly as expensive as you think or
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:40.800]  way more expensive than you think basically it you know what you're right
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:43.360]  because I just taught you I just proved I was right when I explained how it
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:47.560]  works because I really do think there was more action on the under and so I
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:51.680]  should have said it lower I probably like 299 or 300 300 yeah in the number
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:58.120]  the thing I forgot I forgot that build to order options are not 99 numbers
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:05.280]  they're even zero zero numbers so that your config ends up with a 99 right so
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:10.600]  if you upgrade the RAM you pay an even hundred some dollars or like what am I
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:14.840]  talking thousand some dollars here and if you upgrade the storage you end up
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:19.640]  with another thousand dollars and then the end price is still fifty two thousand
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:23.840]  one hundred ninety nine not fifty two thousand one hundred ninety two which
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:27.680]  would be gross who wants to buy a fifty thousand dollar computer that ends in
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:34.320]  92 yeah no no kidding no kidding also it's the great psychology of saying
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:38.360]  well yeah I know but it's not fifty three thousand dollars yeah so how did I
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:43.320]  guess how did I guess 399 I'd number one it's like your thing about what do you
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:48.360]  think you want to pay and then make it more painful crank it up a little bit
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:53.960]  full and then there was the question I asked jaws on stage at my live talk show
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:08:06.520]  earlier this year how much of the wheels gonna cost
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:17.200]  I mean what really is a perfect wheel worth how many do you need well that's
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:21.360]  the thing I'm imagining that they're very nice wheels I was really sort of
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:26.080]  hoping that the hand if there were wheels in the hands-on area I missed
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:29.960]  them I really I wanted to sit there and there was one and their installment
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:32.480]  plans available
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:43.240]  I'll save up all right so Jaws is answer played for laughs there sure and it was
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:49.000]  all good no knowing laughs though knowing laughs right right right and you
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.920]  know but that's that's the genius of a guy like jaws is he knew they were gonna
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:56.680]  be expensive and maybe they didn't have a price yet maybe they didn't know
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:00.320]  exactly and it wasn't like they were trying to hide it but he knew that they
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:06.360]  were building really really nice wheels like it like people laugh like I have
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:11.240]  friends who don't really follow closely like my friend Lee from hop sing
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:15.440]  laundromat who doesn't even use a Mac he uses an iPhone but he just stays tuned
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:20.160]  to like social media and like at the end of WWDC week he like texted me is hey
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:25.120]  he goes like John are you kidding me that they're selling $1,000 monitor
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:30.920]  stand it's like nope not kidding you like somehow news of that leaked out to
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:35.840]  like the real world that Apple was selling $1,000 stand for my daughter did
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:40.160]  the same thing she came home from school one day I was like really thousand
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:43.800]  dollar monitor sample I can well it's complicated but yeah right yeah but it's
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:49.480]  not it's not like just some you know stick with a screw on the end of it if
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:54.960]  I'd suspect given Apple's regular margins it really is a thousand dollar
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:59.280]  mechanical device you know it's it's super I mean arguably over engineered
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:03.480]  but yeah it's engineered it locks in horizontal and it locks in a separate
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:06.760]  vertical where it raises up and then it won't go down like it's it's and it
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:11.680]  will seriously engineer right and it won't let you rotate the display if it
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:18.040]  isn't high enough for the display to go from horizontal to vertical orientation
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:24.480]  you know it's all true and so I but I I do think that these are $400 wheels I
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:29.640]  really do now are there a lot of people who have a use case for this machine
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:36.440]  we're having it on wheels is what they want who would be much happier with
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:45.400]  lower grade wheels like let's just say the wheels from like an Aeron chair who
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:50.240]  would be much happier just putting hundred dollar set of wheels on the same
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:55.080]  Mac Pro yeah I think there's a lot of them I mean did Apple need to make super
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:11:00.960]  premium $400 wheels no but you know I think I think they're thinking well
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:04.560]  you're spending $6,000 for a computer we're gonna make the wheels not look
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:07.840]  cheap because that's also it's Apple right but it's also we got this
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:10.640]  beautiful stainless steel frame and the beautiful aluminum skin and we're gonna
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:15.880]  make these awesome wheels I had for my power Mac g4 I think I had a thing that
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:21.080]  was basically like a Lucite skateboard with essentially Aeron chair wheels on
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:25.480]  it in order to make it a wheeled configuration and I use those wheels all
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:29.360]  the time to move it around to my you know when I was you know it was like in
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:32.920]  my closet and I had to pull it in order to pull it out in order to install
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:36.520]  things in it and stuff like that so I can see the need I will also predict now
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:41.480]  that somebody probably 12 South yeah we'll have add-on wheels for the
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:45.800]  existing configuration that will be that will cost quite a bit less than $400
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:51.000]  yes I won't be as nice but we'll be nice enough as an aftermarket thing and that
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.040]  if you really don't care about how nice the wheels are you just want it to wheel
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:59.040]  it around there will be some sort of third-party sets of wheels for a hundred
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:03.680]  for $29 or something like that that you can safely secure you know maybe like
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:06.800]  with a skateboard I don't know I mean you don't really does anybody really
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:19.000]  care but there you go $400 yep yep for the wheels it was funny did you ask I
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  remember at WWDC asking in price you know I so the best was that clip I
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.880]  played where you know I asked jaws on stage and he couldn't really no answer
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:30.880]  out of it and he handled it brilliantly but I remember asking privately hey how
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:33.600]  much do the wheels cost you know like talking you know like in the hands-on
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:38.160]  area after the after the right and they were they I forget what they say they
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.880]  have like the best non answers they're like we're not talking about pricing
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:46.760]  today something like that pricing for the wheel yeah I love it when you ask a
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:49.240]  question that's off the script and you and and these poor people who are
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:53.200]  generally not like this super high test marketing people right there people who
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:55.960]  have been conscripted to do the demos and they've been trained on what to say
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:59.440]  and they've got like a pattern that they go through and then you ask them a
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:02.760]  question that's totally off the script and they get this look like not it's not
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:06.000]  just I don't know the answer but it's like oh if I say something wrong here
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.800]  they're really gonna get me well you know and then they they brush it off and
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:16.760]  and you move on so the highest end configuration you get if you max
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:21.240]  everything out oh the other thing we should talk about is with the before we
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:25.960]  go on to this is with the graphics there's two coming soon graphics cards
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:32.720]  right and I don't know what they're going to cost but I asked I double
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:36.280]  checked with Syracuse uh and he said they you know they're they're the
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:40.960]  caliber of card that would slot they're not like all the other coming soon stuff
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:48.960]  is like the highest end config like the 1.25 gigabytes of storage the rack mount
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:53.720]  instead of the desktop mount these aren't high-end configs these are like
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:14:00.480]  above the base model but below the current first upgrade level of the
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:04.920]  Radeon Pro Vega 2 and that makes sense if you just look at the amount of RAM on
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.760]  all of these cards I don't know anything about modern high-end video cards but
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:18.240]  the first two upgrades are 32 gigabytes and the second two are 32 or 2 by 32
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:25.000]  gigabytes so if you just go by how much RAM is on the card it seems pretty clear
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.280]  these would slot in below and Syracuse estimates that they'll probably maybe be
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:33.080]  like a thousand dollar update or maybe you know like eight hundred and sixteen
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:37.520]  hundred or something like that so that there's a much smoother continuum
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:41.840]  between the base model and the first current first available upgrade for
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:46.240]  graphics card which is $2,400 which is pretty significant for one tick up on
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:49.920]  the graphics right right and this is this is actually an announcement on
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:53.320]  today to December 10th that they announced this there's actually an AMD
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:15:00.440]  press release about it so they coming yeah but but not available yet but
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:03.880]  coming soon again whatever that means I also think for everybody who's following
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:08.480]  John Syracuse's Odyssey of having a cheese grater Mac Pro for 10 years and
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:12.600]  waiting for this model so that he can buy one my understanding is that this is
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:19.840]  the the graphics card that John wants yeah oh so just deferring I guess and
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:26.560]  again it also comes in with the with what does coming soon mean right like
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:31.520]  right coming soon January 1st cuz that might fit very closely with when
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:34.840]  Syracuse it was gonna order anyway because he's not really an order on day
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:40.120]  one he's a he's he wants to sit on these options for you know at least a couple
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:43.840]  of weeks and maybe you know see what happened he said on the show maybe you
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.880]  know let people early adopters get them and see if they're actually as promised
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:52.500]  before he puts his money in I mean honestly he seems a little tight with
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:57.700]  his money if you ask me well I think he should have bought a 5k iMac when it
[01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:00.200]  came out oh yeah years ago and he would have been using a modern Mac for the
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:03.800]  last five years exactly right he's decided to wait and is still waiting
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:09.400]  inability to compromises is admirable in some ways it is admirable yes it is
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:12.360]  what makes him who he is and that's why we love him all right and so for example
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:18.320]  he's not going to compromise by getting a better video card for $2,400 that he
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:23.280]  is convinced he doesn't need and it's probably right even though he's been
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:29.800]  waiting 10 years and the cost of that $2,400 upgrade that's available today
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:35.480]  versus what he could get if he waits it's probably you know like $800 or
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:39.920]  something like that or a thousand dollars and if you amortize that over 10
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:45.560]  years he's been waiting sure comes out to pennies per day but he'll wait anyway
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:51.960]  the maxed out config you can buy today is fifty one thousand fifty two thousand
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:57.040]  one hundred ninety nine dollars and if you add the eight terabyte SSD that is
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:01.120]  coming which I think will be twelve hundred dollars more than the current
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:05.640]  price you'd get fifty three thousand three hundred ninety nine but that does
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:14.960]  not include wheels and again I'm not about a car that expensive I'm laughing
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:18.920]  I'm laughing but I I don't think it's ridiculous I'm glad Apple is making a
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:23.400]  fifty four thousand dollar computer and you know and in in other industries not
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:27.000]  computer but like you know if you're in like construction or something like that
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:35.320]  buying the tractors or construction equipment that cost $50,000 is a
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:41.120]  no-brainer right I mean I was reading and I'm not surprised by this I'm not
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:46.480]  surprised at all that you know some people who are outside of the the market
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:52.920]  for pickup trucks just have no idea but a lot of people who have pickup trucks
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:57.160]  are super serious about them and they use them in really serious ways and you
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:02.240]  know this is in the context of reading in the context of the Tesla super mega
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:08.360]  Cybertruck that people who buy trucks spend a lot of money on them and it's
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:11.600]  you know it's one of the reasons that the car companies if you watch sports
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:15.360]  you know like spend an awful lot of time advertising pickup trucks which is a
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:21.240]  relatively small part of the market overall at least like an urban area like
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:25.400]  where I live but it's because they're super people are they're willing to
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:29.000]  spend a lot of money on them construction equipment all sorts of
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.520]  industries medical equipment right like how much the doctors pay for high-end
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:38.440]  diagnostic equipment you know why shouldn't people who spend their time in
[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:43.720]  front of a workstation computer be able to spend that much money on something
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:49.760]  that's central to their work so I laugh it's not a luxury product in that way
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:52.280]  it's a luxury product if you don't need it and you want to buy it because it's
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:56.840]  cool but if you're somebody who is in a high-end professional production
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:01.000]  environment where they're spending you like the camera you're not gonna buy a
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.120]  camera you're gonna use your phone but if you bought a camera it would be a
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:06.520]  thousand dollar camera or a $2,000 camera well they're they're buying a
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:11.200]  camera for $80,000 and they're buying a lighting rig for hundreds of thousands
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:14.960]  of dollars and like they're buying a storage area network and installing it
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:17.920]  and that's gonna cost them tens of thousands of dollars for them or
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:22.560]  hundreds of thousands of dollars for them a $50,000 config of a computer is
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:26.800]  not a big deal it's not like that money is play money but it's like there in the
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:30.520]  context of a much larger business that has a lot of expensive equipment because
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:34.760]  that's their business yeah and I also think that in the context of that like
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:42.280]  some kind of high-end 3d imaging dingus you know like for like oral surgeon or
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:46.440]  you know any kind of doctor who needs to see inside your body and has this high
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:50.920]  end thing you know that maybe it does cost $400 just to get the same thing
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:56.220]  with wheels I don't maybe so I wouldn't be surprised if it's even more in some
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:20:02.840]  cases because they're even less price sensitive than computer people who seem
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:06.000]  to you know who know the price of individual video cards and stuff like
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:11.080]  that right and if there's a smart person negotiating on the other end of the line
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:15.080]  for that you know for that production house that's gonna order 15 of them
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:18.840]  they're gonna say you know what I'd like the wheels but I'm not gonna pay for
[01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:21.840]  them let's you know I'll buy another one if you throw in the wheels and there's
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:26.560]  probably negotiation that actually happens at that level anyway yeah all
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:30.080]  right let's take a break and I think our next sponsor and oh I cannot wait to
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:36.040]  tell you about them Linode Linode is a hosting company dedicated CPUs
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:44.720]  distributed applications hosted services websites CI slash CD environments they've
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:49.520]  got a $20 credit for all new customers all of their options feature native SSD
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:53.960]  storage a 40 gigabit network industry leading processors pick from any of
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:58.360]  their 10 worldwide data centers you pick one close to you you pick one in your
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:01.480]  country they have a new one in Toronto for our Canadian friends who might need
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:06.760]  for legal reasons to keep their data in country pay what you use with hourly
[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:11.080]  billing across all plans and add-on services guess what daring fireball
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:15.240]  itself for the last month maybe even to the date no I think it was I think it
[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:19.480]  was I forget what date in November we switched it over but it's close to a
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:24.520]  month Jason even knows about that a little bit because I had some movable
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:29.680]  type uh-huh hacking that was involved daring for all three of us in the
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:34.560]  movable type community heard about that daring fireball itself is now running on
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:44.440]  Linode after I believe 13 years at my previous host it was a long time and oh
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:48.440]  my god am I happy with it I knew I would be but it just shows how nuts I am that
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:55.040]  I procrastinated on this until I did it is fantastic it is so so you the the
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:58.560]  reader of daring fireball probably don't notice any difference although you might
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:01.760]  but daring fireball has always been very fast to load because it's very snappy
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:06.960]  but from my perspective on the back end dealing with movable type something some
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:11.200]  things that have been very slow are suddenly instantaneous it is tremendous
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:15.280]  I attribute it to the SSD storage everything is great though it's got they
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:20.760]  have a great great control panel they call it cloud line oh calm the cloud
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:26.160]  manager really really great just everything about it and it's so cheap
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:31.280]  I'm that part of it is that this is I'm so much happier as the person using
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:39.560]  my site hosted on this server but I'm saving my bill my monthly bill for
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:42.760]  hosting during fireball has gone from around five hundred and fifty dollars a
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:51.240]  month to like $80 a month so I'm saving like I could buy a Mac Pro maybe by the
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:57.560]  end of the year just based on the money I'm saving now I guess not but I could
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:02.760]  come close but it's it's just it's so much less expensive a so much better
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:08.120]  interface for me and every single way and just a really modern hosting
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:12.680]  environment that I could not be happier with and it's just so snappy whatever
[01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:16.360]  you're doing my needs are pretty simple your needs might be more complex but
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:23.560]  anything you need just it they've got it they have a restful API for developers
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:27.880]  who really need to hook into the back hosting back end and they have an
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:33.000]  officially supported Python command-line interface and they're hiring by the way
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:40.080]  just go to Linode calm l in o de comm slash careers now here's the call to
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:47.080]  action 20 bucks credit when you use this promo code talk show 2019 ta ok sh o w
[01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:53.360]  2019 visit linode comm slash the talk show couldn't be happier with them 20
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:56.400]  bucks credit they started five bucks a month so you can get four months free
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:05.400]  four months free let me take a break here and tell it while we're on it just
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:12.520]  segue right into this basically the problem I ran into is I have never been
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:19.560]  able to post emoji to during fireball and and then I figured out while we were
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:29.200]  testing it that I could it just wasn't the emoji that I wanted to use and it is
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:35.240]  it was it was a days-long saga that getting movable type up a trance you
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:39.360]  know moving the database from the old server exporting it importing it to the
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:43.160]  new one getting movable type in my friend Ryan Schwartz who helped me with
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:46.280]  all this he's a professional assistant man who I've known from my joint days
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:51.620]  got it all up and running on first crack and it was beautiful but except the one
[01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:55.040]  thing I said well here's the thing one of the things I wanted to fix with the
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:25:00.280]  moving this is I want to be able to put emoji in my posts and when I've used
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:03.800]  emoji in the past because I can't put the literal emoji characters in and have
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:08.960]  them go through is I had to translate them to HTML entities and HTML entities
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:13.520]  are ugly anyway but like multi byte Unicode ones are really ugly they're
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:18.000]  like eight character hexadecimal strings wrapped in the H you know the ampersand
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.720]  and then the semicolon at the end and so there's no human readability to them at
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:31.600]  all a days-long saga and basically it boils down to this my SQL which is the
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:35.520]  database I'm using and which is the database that I think movable type which
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:40.040]  is really outdated and old but rock-solid and stable works best with
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:53.160]  in my SQL the text encoding for a table that they call quote utf-8 is not
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:26:02.520]  utf-8 it is a subset of utf-8 that only allows you to post utf-8 characters up
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:08.120]  to three bytes and most of the ones that we think of as emoji the modern picture
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:12.920]  ones like martini glasses and all the you know not to mention the combining
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:17.200]  character ones like so that you can put a thumbs up and change the color of the
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:23.680]  skin to varying you know or to put a couple holding hands and make it to
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:33.040]  women or make it a you know a woman of color and Hispanic colored skin looking
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:40.160]  woman all of those fancy emojis to wouldn't don't work with my SQL so you
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:48.240]  have utf-8 what you want if you want full you utf-8 is utf-8 mb4 and the
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:53.200]  mb4 I guess stands for multibyte for character sequences but that also works
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:59.600]  with the ones that are multi character sequences combining characters as I said
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:06.400]  the problem is movable type works with the utf-8 encoding but it doesn't work
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:12.560]  with the utf-8 mb4 because it's just like newer than it I don't know there's
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:18.240]  no I I don't want I don't know what the reason is but the bottom line is and the
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:22.680]  thing is movable type has gotten so old that it is really hard to Google for
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:27.400]  anything with it now which is really strange because I'm I've just been
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:31.600]  starting to find that where I used to be able to Google for tag references and
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:35.740]  get movable type answers and something happened recently where the the reference
[01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:39.280]  site for that has been downgraded and that's much harder to find references
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:43.720]  it's really really hard and that's crazy if that software is old and out of date
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:47.920]  yeah but it's strange because other stuff that's old and out of date is
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:54.200]  still easy to Google for but movable type store is not and so it's hard to
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:58.440]  even Google and get an answer and find get someone to just say you know what
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:04.560]  don't don't try using movable type with utf-8 and before it just doesn't work
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:10.360]  right and so the answer and here's the curious thing is I talked this is where
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:16.000]  Jason Snell gets roped into it and and our mutual friend Greg house or is it
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:25.160]  canals nos nos canos just nos Greg nos like boss yeah who might be the the best
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:29.200]  living movable type expert he is the world's foremost authority on movable
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:36.720]  type at this point yeah six colors can and has been able to just paste just put
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:42.960]  raw emoji into like titles and body text for a while and so it's proof that it
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:51.400]  can work and the long story short the answer is that it all just works if you
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:59.040]  set the table text encoding to Latin one which is an old like before Unicode
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:03.880]  single byte text encoding meaning it only had to the single byte means
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:09.080]  there's only 255 characters and most of the a lot of them in the lower range
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:13.960]  aren't really even characters they're weird control sequences from like 1972
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:19.560]  like Bell like Bell yeah yeah anybody had an Apple to knows all about Bell
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:24.200]  control G come on yeah you type control G if you don't remember you type control
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:27.920]  G which was the Bell character and it didn't display anything it just played a
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:38.960]  sound yeah it's ASCII ASCII 8 is yeah it's a beep yeah so a lot of the so how
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:42.320]  does that make sense how does it make sense that using the Latin one text
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:48.480]  encoding allows you which was you know last created in like 1985 verse 86 or
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:53.760]  something like that how in the world does that allow you to post emoji
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:58.360]  characters that are just coming out you know like last year or a month ago when
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:03.760]  iOS 13.2 came out and the answer is because it was a single byte text
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:10.400]  encoding everything that comes in is not really encoded as characters it's just a
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:19.720]  sequence of bytes and if 1013 bytes come in in a certain order and the 1013 bytes
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:25.760]  go out in the same order it'll all just work and if those bytes come in as
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:31.160]  properly formatted to UTF-8 it doesn't matter what MySQL thinks of it just
[01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:34.040]  stores the bytes in order and then it comes out and if everything is
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:37.880]  configured to treat everything coming out as UTF-8 it all just works and
[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:42.880]  there's probably developers out there screaming their heads off saying oh my
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:47.680]  god that's that's a nightmare but the solution of my problem was literally by
[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:55.760]  switching from MySQL's UTF-8 which isn't UTF-8 to Latin one which isn't
[01:30:55.760 --> 01:31:02.040]  Unicode at all and now computers great it all just works now I know I know a
[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:08.160]  lot more about text encoding miss Mitch Matt mismatches like when in the back in
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:11.680]  the day you will remember this for sure a lot of people listening will but
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:17.920]  Windows and Mac had different text encodings and and so max was called Mac
[01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:23.160]  or in English and you know there was Mac Japanese and you know but the problem
[01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:26.440]  was they were all single byte I don't know I guess Japanese couldn't have been
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:29.640]  I don't know how the Mac Japanese encoding were now that I think about it
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:36.200]  but the the for English language of Roman Latin language speakers who use
[01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:40.440]  the alphabet we think of the Mac Roman text encoding was what we used and it
[01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:46.160]  was totally different above the first 128 ASCII characters then the windows
[01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:49.720]  one and the windows one this is the where it gets really complicated there
[01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:54.300]  was Windows Latin one Windows Latin one was different than like the ISO whatever
[01:31:54.300 --> 01:32:02.360]  Latin one but only in only a handful of characters I got really really good at
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:07.680]  dealing with those problems because it was super super common when I was doing
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:12.880]  graphic design back then where you'd get copy from a client and it was you know
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:18.600]  they were using PCs and all of a sudden it was super helpful to be the Mac
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:25.200]  designer who knew how to use BB edit or something else with regular expressions
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:31.000]  to manually fix text encoding by like swapping out every single one of these
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.500]  weird ones oh I know I know what that weird-looking character is that's
[01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:39.000]  supposed to be a curly quote and you just find and replace this weird-looking
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:43.560]  thing I don't even know what it's called with an actual proper opening double
[01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:49.400]  curly quote and this other weird character with an opening closing quote
[01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:53.640]  and all of these are apostrophes you could just learn to recognize them and
[01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:58.120]  then you could build a little yeah you'll be like an O with like the letter
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:01.020]  O with a squiggly over and you'd be like that's an ellipsis I know what that is I
[01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:06.200]  ended up writing a script to do that at some point because I realized that it
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:09.840]  was always the same and it was just a missing code because something came over
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:13.600]  the internet and got messed up where right someplace in the process it
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:17.280]  misunderstood what the encoding was yeah you just have to put it back that way
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:23.080]  right and it was that whole scenario was why there were so many people who used
[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:27.560]  and I don't even blame them really who because they didn't care about the type
[01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:32.320]  of type of graphic purity of using proper quotes they stayed say quote
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:38.480]  unquote I hate curly quotes I hate them because they'd run into these issues
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:43.040]  we're going from Mac to Windows it would go across but I totally I as
[01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:49.800]  nightmarish as it sounds using Latin one encoded tables in my SQL to store utf-8
[01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:55.840]  in a in a setup that I intend to use you know for at least a decade you know for
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:00.560]  did possibly longer I have complete confidence in it because it really is
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:05.240]  just bites in bites out it's garbage in garbage out and I'm confident that
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:08.440]  that's that's the beauty of it right is that it's just not even messing with it
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:11.920]  it's just whatever you pass in it passes back out right the down the only
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:16.940]  downside to it is that if you like use the MySQL command-line tool at the
[01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:22.280]  server to like query like a table or something like that it will display the
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:25.640]  characters wrong because the MySQL command-line thing was we'll look at the
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:31.480]  Latin one thing and helpfully format your utf-8 bytes as Latin one but I
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:36.640]  never used the my I don't need the MySQL command-line tool to to diddle with my
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:41.680]  tables anyway so that's fine so that's my upgrade I have the same issue I
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:46.880]  actually am now behind you because I'm already on Linode but we have to do an
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:51.200]  update where using old software is amazing right so movable type we use it
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:55.880]  not because we're stubborn maybe a little bit because we're stubborn it's
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:35:00.080]  the right tool for the job and if I have a need to change I'll change but right
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:03.760]  now it's the right tool for the job and I know it really well and and Greg is
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:08.000]  the foremost expert so he's very helpful and all that but I have discovered that
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:13.600]  we're on an old version of Ubuntu and the new version of Ubuntu and it's got
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:18.320]  like you log in that says you need to update it no more critical updates will
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:21.320]  be done on this system right which is great except if you go to the new
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:25.640]  version it's using a version of pearl that doesn't work with new type anymore
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:29.200]  so you have to do this whole thing where you then you have to change the version
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:32.000]  of pearl and we still haven't done that but we have to do that where it's like
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.960]  you can update to this new OS what you have to do but then this other part of
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:39.960]  it now is broken and then you have to downgrade that in order it's a whole
[01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:43.880]  thing old software at some at some point we're just gonna be running these things
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:47.680]  in a virtual machine somewhere right yeah at some point in the pearl
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:52.220]  development process there's a whole long story about the saga of pearl 5 and pearl
[01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:55.520]  6 and I think the pearl 6 community is actually going to just rename the
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:59.320]  language just something else I forget where they're going with that rock rock
[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:02.400]  Roku or so I don't know what the hell are gonna call it but good for them
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:07.440]  because it really isn't pearl 6 it really is a new language that is very
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:11.860]  very very pearly but totally incompatible and different and in the
[01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:17.200]  meat in the meantime in literally like 15 years of maybe longer of pearl 6 is
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:22.400]  development and nobody's really in my opinion or experience using it the pearl
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:27.000]  5 community has kept going and since pearl 6 was like started as a project
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:35.600]  pearls gone from like pearl 5.05 to like pearl 5.28 and that's a lot and like a
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:40.940]  pearl does a thing the pro community does a thing where the dot odd numbers
[01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:48.400]  are like unstable so like pearl 5.27 is unstable and pearl 5.28 is the stable
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:56.400]  version of what 27 was in development but at some point in like the teens the
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:02.240]  five point teens the pro community got a little bit aggressive about not worrying
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:06.760]  about backwards compatibility in a way that actually kind of reminds me of
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:12.160]  Apple in a way that you know that not that they're careless about backwards
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:17.000]  compatibility but that they will deprecate things with you know and issue
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.880]  warnings to the community that such and such is deprecated and support for it
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:25.800]  will be dropped you know two versions from now which you know might be like a
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:33.200]  year from now or something like that but like heretofore the pearl had pretty
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:37.040]  much you know considered breaking back anything that worked before that broke
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:41.600]  on an upgrade was considered a bug and that's more or less where movable type
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:49.960]  has run into problems rock it was now apparently the name of pearl 6 and pearl
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:55.880]  5 is now just pearl again rock I convinced myself that it was wrong so
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:38:00.880]  what's it called rock rock who rock who are a k you rock who rock who named
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:05.120]  after apparently a compiler yeah that tells you that isn't that interesting
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:08.120]  right it's the idea like well we're gonna we're gonna take this and we're
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:11.120]  gonna make a brand new version and it diverges so much from the old version
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:13.720]  and the old version has so many adherence that they don't want to go to
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:17.520]  the new version that at some point both sides agree we should not have the same
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:20.800]  names anymore because we're not the same project yeah well though but the thing
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:25.960]  that's really funny to me is this is like 15 years into pearl 6 yeah it took
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:30.760]  them that long to do it but anyway the basically what you have to do and I know
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:34.800]  you know because I talked about it with Greg is you you install an alternate
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:38.900]  version of pearl you can't and shouldn't replace the system version of pearl with
[01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:42.960]  an old pearl you just install another version of pearl somewhere on your
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:48.240]  machine and then you just said you'd set movable type to use that in all of the
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:52.360]  little shebang lines at the top of all the scripts and then you can use the
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:55.600]  system pearl for all the other stuff and then somewhere John Syracuse is
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:59.840]  listening to us and pearl expert though he is who has long advised never using
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:04.040]  the system pearl for anything and always I mean he's been telling me this for 20
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:09.360]  years of me installing everything in system pearl on my max as I go along
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:13.440]  that I'm out of my mind in saying that you shouldn't ever touch it just leave
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:17.400]  it alone always install your own pearl alongside it usually to get newer pearls
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:21.960]  back in the day it's the opposite problem to want to have an older pearl
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:26.320]  but it's actually pretty easy and it was actually an easier part it sounds like a
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:30.460]  nightmare maybe but it actually was pretty easy this is never gonna be a
[01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:33.600]  better episode of the talk show for John Syracuse it than this one it's all Mac
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:40.480]  Pro and pearl so all right what else do we have anything else oh we don't have
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:45.360]  anything else on Mac Pro but we've got the pro display XDR which we can talk
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:51.280]  about yeah it's it's it there it is it's coming out it's you can buy one now
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:57.720]  works with systems from like 19 and 18 but not before like you got to have
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:01.600]  discrete graphics it has to be relatively recent so not the iMac Pro but
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:06.120]  the and not MacBook Pro 15 inch MacBook from last year and the new iMacs from
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:10.920]  last year or from earlier this year are in there but the 13 inch MacBook Pro is
[01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:16.920]  not right which is the to me the most conspicuous update up missing one even
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:20.920]  more than the Mac iMac Pro although I agree that that's got to be a top one a
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:25.200]  top config for using it as a secondary display because the iMac Pro is such a
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:30.400]  good machine for so many pro uses where somebody really might want the pro
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:33.880]  display XDR for the you know the brightness in the image clarity and all
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:39.680]  the blah blah blah right you know were you a movie editor you know would want
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:44.440]  the pro display XDR and I use the iMac for the editing iMac Pro for the editing
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:48.560]  and have the pro display XDR so I agree that's a big one but the fact that the
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:53.480]  13 inch MacBook Pro doesn't support it seems like a big deal too that doesn't
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:56.320]  have any great graphics right so I think I get the feeling like if they're gonna
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:41:00.160]  do an update to this thing and they want to support the pro XDR they're gonna
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:03.120]  have to put discrete graphics in it which they haven't done up to now yeah
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:07.360]  but on the other hand maybe the new maybe there will be a new 16 inch
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:12.280]  MacBook Pro style revision to the 13 inch and it still won't support the XDR
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:16.320]  maybe that's you know 16 inch only I don't know but I would expect an updated
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:23.200]  when and inevitably sometime next year a 13 inch MacBook Pro update comes out
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:29.920]  that it'll support the XDR I hope so it would be a shame although I mean you
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:34.320]  could make the argument that if you're using that like monitor that you're
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:37.800]  probably going to be using a much higher-end kind of device to drive it
[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:42.240]  but I can see the the value of having the the smaller laptop there's a you
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:45.240]  know in the end it's gonna be Apple looking at that laptop and saying can it
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:49.640]  bear discrete graphics in it or is that just not what that product is about yeah
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:53.440]  you know I don't know I don't know what the thermals and what the physical size
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:58.200]  of the those graphics that that are needed to support it are but we'll see
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:02.400]  but it's a conspicuous absence now and it would be even if it continues to not
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:05.520]  support it it's sort of conspicuous because I can imagine that there's some
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:10.400]  people who just want the big beautiful monitor on their desk but who want a 13
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:16.040]  inch MacBook Pro because they want the smaller I mean as somebody who's been
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:20.520]  using a 13 inch MacBook Pro for five years and is now toting around this 15
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:25.880]  inch review unit it's definitely noticeable I mean it's you know it is
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:30.040]  not as portable as yeah you know by definition did I just call it a 15 inch
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:33.720]  again I think I think you I think I think you did at least you're consistent
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:41.280]  that's good what else with the Mac Pro oh there's a unique keyboard mouse and
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:45.360]  trackpad colors they're they're different they're not space gray because
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:52.120]  of course because the Mac Pro itself is not space great so Apple is not going to
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:57.640]  sell you space gray keyboard and mouse with a not space gray Mac Pro instead
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:02.320]  they've come out with new keyboard mouse and trackpad colors that are black key
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:09.640]  caps or sort of a lot of glass the black on the trackpad is the the glass is
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:14.800]  black but then it has silver aluminum gray I can't wait to see the aftermarket
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:18.200]  on those you remember when the iMac Pro came out and there was like the they
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:23.200]  were there was a serious short-run eBay market to be made in selling those
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:27.760]  things because they weren't available as standalone devices and then they
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:32.320]  eventually were but right right up front they weren't my beef is that that's the
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:37.280]  one thing I hate and have hated for years now on the magic keyboards that
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:41.440]  Apple sells and ships with regular iMac's is I think the white key caps are
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:45.480]  ugly and I don't see why they're white I think that and in the same way that
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:50.760]  every single Mac whatever color Mac or not Mac but MacBook right whether you
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:56.280]  get space gray or regular gray or the rose gold or gold or whatever colors are
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:01.040]  available in MacBooks at the current moment the key caps are always black so
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:05.000]  why are the key caps white on the magic keyboard I think the black key caps
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:10.640]  clearly look better yeah I agree I don't like that I don't like the numeric
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:16.040]  keyboard I when I got my iMac Pro actually sold for like cost to some to a
[01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:20.600]  friend that keyboard because it's like it's numeric keypad it's too wide I
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:25.000]  don't even want it anymore and you know but I didn't I didn't profit on on the
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.120]  color the color difference but I agree I think the black keys are nice that's the
[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:33.400]  keyboard I'm using you know now it's a I mean it's a mechanical keyboard oh I
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:36.920]  touch the third rail there didn't I but it's nice and it's you know dark dark
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:42.600]  keys and it's nice ignore ignore must ignore my soldier on with the with the
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:45.720]  you know something I wanted to mention that we haven't mentioned yet is that
[01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:50.000]  you know you and I are frequently in the reviews program for products and we
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:55.480]  don't have Mac pros no and and there's a really good reason for this and it is
[01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:59.560]  one of the things that informs when I write about like you don't want you
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:05.960]  don't actually want or need a Mac Pro is Apple is Apple is very careful these
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:09.600]  days with high-end products like this because they know that if they give
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:17.000]  these products to your average tech product reviewer there you know unless
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.640]  they're very lucky and that person also happens to be a high-end video producer
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:24.520]  on the side like their perspective on it they're like not going to get it they're
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:28.320]  not going to understand how this thing they're not going to be able to test it
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:33.800]  realistically because it's beyond their scope of what they do and I know that's
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:36.640]  true for me like the only reason that I felt like I could review the iMac Pro
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:41.400]  was because of all the audio stuff that I do that has that really can use all
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:46.000]  those cores yeah so they don't do that like they don't go to the usual suspects
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:50.560]  with this and they didn't with the iMac Pro and like the only reason I review
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:55.480]  the iMac Pro is that I bought one and that because I wanted it that's the only
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:46:00.440]  reason so it's a very different like Apple knows that they need to see this
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:05.200]  to what we saw which is like youtubers because they are cranking through huge
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:08.840]  amounts of video all the time and other video and high-end photography kind of
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:13.840]  people and so it's an unusual product rollout it's not the usual suspects for
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:17.600]  this for I think a good reason a fair reason which is like I thought about
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:22.080]  asking them like doing my usual kind of pitch of like I know you know you're
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:24.500]  gonna do something different but I wouldn't want to be considered or
[01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:29.080]  whatever and I was like you know it's a reach even for me with my audio stuff
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:32.820]  it's like it's kind of out of my range here and so what would I judge it on I
[01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:36.680]  could I could do some artificial tests but like not sure that that really
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:41.480]  qualifies as being like I'm not a good reviewer for this product because it's
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:44.560]  so high-end yeah I feel the exact same way I if they had offered it to me I
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:47.800]  think I would have turned them down because I think it would be more hassle
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:54.400]  yeah to set it up and then eventually send it back to them and I don't know
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:57.360]  what I would do I honestly feel ill-equipped I feel like someone you know
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:04.320]  like if I'm somebody who writes you know like Consumer Reports style you know
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:09.460]  reviewing the hunt this year's Honda Accord and you know there's a Lexus
[01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:16.840]  sedan and here's the new Subaru Outback hatchback thing but I don't know how to
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:22.020]  drive at a racetrack how am I gonna review a new Lamborghini like not that
[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:25.280]  I wouldn't enjoy taking it for a spin and not that I wouldn't enjoy you know
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:30.000]  playing with the Mac Pro I just feel like perfect personally ill-equipped to
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.160]  write a review because I don't do anything that really would let it shine
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:39.360]  you know yeah I mean I could denoise a four hour long D&D session from somebody
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:43.280]  in a noisy space with isotope and it would be really fast and then I would
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:46.640]  say okay that's there there we are that would be about I don't even edit my own
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:51.600]  podcast though so I can't even do that I I mean like I said I you know I've been
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:57.000]  using Xcode unusually for me in the last two weeks but even there it's like I'm
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.040]  already seeing you know fast enough results just using the 16-inch MacBook
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:06.440]  Pro it's not using a Mac Pro isn't gonna help me with with my little little
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:12.440]  project there who has any reviews out I don't even know I've been so busy today
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:16.560]  with a few things it looks like a staggered rollout too because like the
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:20.920]  videos that I've seen from youtubers tend to be kind of like unboxing and
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:24.960]  first impressions and there there have been a couple of blog posts that I've
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:29.560]  seen that are kind of like first impressions so it may actually be that
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:32.440]  they've got an embargo to like say you've got the product and give your
[01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:37.040]  first impressions but not a full review I don't know that for a fact but that
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:42.800]  may be the case of like you know not yet because I know MKBHD sort of promised a
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:47.480]  full review video but his first video is not that it's a it's a much shorter kind
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:50.960]  of like here's here's what I've been thinking but it's like not the in-depth
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:54.080]  kind of thing so there's it seems like it's a staged rollout it's a very
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:58.720]  different kind of kind of product roll out for sure yeah and my guess is you
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:01.960]  know in some ways Apple repeats itself or the patterns are pretty obvious but
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:08.520]  if you think back to the month ago 16-inch MacBook Pro show in New York and
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:13.440]  the demos that we saw is my you know it's not just gonna be all video
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:19.280]  producers and youtubers it's going to be an equal number of the use cases that
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:23.520]  they see and we had those demo stations where we trade around and went from
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:27.960]  station to station and here's what it means for developers and I remember when
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:31.040]  the iMac Pro came out a couple years ago they had the guy who was like an
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:38.160]  aerospace engineer you know and doing these real complicated analysis of like
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:41.600]  wing design and stuff like that which as you might imagine you know
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:47.040]  computationally extremely expensive but just finding people like that people in
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:52.160]  in truly pressing the limits of but but from various fields visual effects
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:59.280]  people independent filmmaker and youtuber types developers composers they
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:02.680]  said that amazing kind of demo where and this is I've heard from a couple of
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:06.320]  people who are professional musicians and and scoring kind of people that like
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:10.580]  it literally is the case now where they have multiple Macs that are working in
[01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:14.660]  harmony because logic can't control that many software instruments of like an
[01:50:14.660 --> 01:50:19.760]  orchestra and you know so you've got like multiple Macs wired together and
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:23.120]  and you have to update things in the different versions of logic and all of
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:27.280]  that and the Mac Pro just runs it with all of the instruments it just runs it
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:30.720]  and that's a great I when they found that out I'm sure they glommed on to
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:33.960]  that it's like look this is an application that used to take five Mac
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:39.800]  pros all running in in synchrony to do this thing and now one Mac Pro does it
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:43.480]  it's like that's a great demo for scoring yeah well I think it plays into
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:47.480]  you know Apple did exactly what they said they were gonna do 980 some days
[01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:51.600]  ago and talk to actual pros about their needs and they had that ready to go if
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:55.760]  you remember they're in the hands-on area at WWDC the day you know the day
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:51:01.600]  these these the Mac Pro was announced they had a whole room dedicated to a I
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:07.220]  forget which movie it was from but a true major Hollywood movie and they had
[01:51:07.220 --> 01:51:10.700]  the actual score from it all running on one machine and I forget how many
[01:51:10.700 --> 01:51:14.960]  machines they said it had to run on when they actually were doing the work it was
[01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:19.520]  like four I don't know like force machines hooked up or maybe more I don't
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:23.040]  know but that having it all on one machine simplified the workflow
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:28.920]  tremendously and just just as the user you just scroll through and just see
[01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:33.000]  all these tracks and there they all are and instead of having to go over to this
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.160]  other machine to do the horns they're all the horns are already there there
[01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:40.480]  they are yeah it's it's it's a good demo like I know why they they did it in June
[01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:43.840]  and they did it again last month is that it's a really good demo and a really
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:49.140]  good example of how the what's possible on one of these computers is is so much
[01:51:49.140 --> 01:51:53.520]  better than what the reality is today so that's just you know they're gonna they
[01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:57.600]  apples really good at this I mean we haven't even mentioned the whole group
[01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:03.600]  inside Apple which I know came up 980 days ago as well like they have this
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:08.840]  whole pro workflows group now and this product as well as the MacBook Pro 16
[01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:16.920]  inch are a are the first products to really be created in partnership with
[01:52:16.920 --> 01:52:20.920]  that pro workflows group and those are those are people those are people who
[01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:25.960]  professionally do the things that these computers are supposed to solve and
[01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:30.400]  that's you know it's really interesting like they're not they're not theorizing
[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:35.280]  about like well what would a music pro or a film pro want like the film pro and
[01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:39.720]  the music pro are in the same it's not even like available somewhere off-campus
[01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:44.640]  like they're across the hall they're in the same room like with the people who
[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:48.700]  are working on the pro hardware and and that's why I think that you know they
[01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:52.920]  know very well what parts of the market of various markets they're hitting with
[01:52:52.920 --> 01:53:00.400]  this product yeah hidden miss miscellaneous items now there's no
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:06.320]  webcam on the pro display XDR and friend friend of the show Mark Gurman pointed
[01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:10.400]  that out today and wondered why it hadn't been mentioned had been mentioned
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:16.320]  actually right in the keynote I believe and the interesting answer on that which
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:19.600]  I hadn't thought of but then as soon as I was told actually was like oh of
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:28.080]  course so you think your answer well the pros don't need a webcam built-in or if
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:32.120]  you're spending all this money you'll buy an external one no the answer is
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:35.880]  actually that they went and talked to actual pros and they said please don't
[01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:39.240]  put a webcam on this because if you do I won't be able to use it and they're like
[01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:43.440]  why and there because it for security reasons cameras aren't allowed in the
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:46.960]  rooms where they're editing these films or doing the VFX or something like that
[01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:51.040]  because it's there's there's that's how tight security is like when you're doing
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:55.000]  the visual effects for I'll just you know Star Wars or something like right
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:59.600]  yeah and you could say well wait the webcam points away from the display so
[01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:02.680]  you how could you know photograph the display with the webcam when it's in
[01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:05.800]  there but who knows if there's a display across from the display if you're
[01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:09.520]  working back-to-back with somebody so the kid you know those rooms when they
[01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:14.960]  say no cameras they mean no cameras right which is a fan they are they do
[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:19.080]  there is a partner and I don't know if it's Logitech or somebody else but Apple
[01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:22.840]  said like a partner is making one that's gonna be color matched in every yeah I
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:26.720]  think it is yeah I think it's a lot so if you want one you can buy one and add
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:30.120]  it and it magnetically clips on and stuff like that but it doesn't come with
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:33.480]  one yeah probably we'll have a much better resolution than most of Apple's
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:40.520]  front-facing cameras under max here's a question I had so what are the missing
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:44.200]  max now that the Mac Pro is out and the one that first one that pops into my
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:48.960]  mind I mentioned this a few shows ago but with a 15 inch or 16 inch whatever
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:54.120]  you want to call it but bigger than 13 inch non pro MacBook there was some guy
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:57.640]  on Twitter who I don't know if I have the link or not but somebody was
[01:54:57.640 --> 01:55:01.040]  mentioning in a thread on this pricing or he had a client who wants to switch
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:08.400]  from the Mac from the PC to the Mac and wants a 15 inch laptop and he said well
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:12.380]  they start at $2,400 and that the guy just laughed because he doesn't want a
[01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:19.000]  $2,400 laptop and again you know as a starting price for max $9.99 is pretty
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:24.140]  high in the PC world as the cheapest laptop you can buy this isn't really
[01:55:24.140 --> 01:55:30.520]  about that $2,400 as the starting price is to some people with typical needs of
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:35.540]  just email web browsing that sort of thing $2,400 is is way too much for a
[01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:40.840]  laptop yeah but a 15 inch display is something that lots and lots and lots of
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:44.640]  people could enjoy because you know it puts more on screen and if you're very
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:48.840]  just completely happy and satisfied toting around a 15 inch instead of 13
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:57.080]  inch laptop you know the PC world has options for you there are high-end 15
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:02.940]  inch 16 inch laptops and there are low end 15 inch laptops for people who want
[01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:09.420]  a lower end lower cost laptop but still want a 15 inch screen to me that's a
[01:56:09.420 --> 01:56:13.260]  missing Mac and I don't think we're ever gonna get it I think up I think if we
[01:56:13.260 --> 01:56:18.780]  were going to that would have come out years ago but I think it's sort of a
[01:56:18.780 --> 01:56:24.720]  shame yeah I think that it's worth saying that the consumer laptop thing
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:29.480]  that Apple's been doing like Apple was in a bind for a bunch of years where
[01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:33.420]  they had the MacBook and they thought that was gonna replace the MacBook Air
[01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:37.360]  but it didn't and they had a 13 inch MacBook Pro that was kind of not a
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:43.360]  MacBook Pro but kind of was and that didn't either and finally those are gone
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:50.160]  and the there is the MacBook Air retina and it feels like they've at least now
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:55.280]  got an answer for what's your consumer Mac laptop now I would say from there
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:57:01.600]  there's a good question to ask which is is that single laptop the only consumer
[01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:06.600]  Mac laptop answer or is that the place from which they can kind of grow and
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:11.920]  find their way and whether that means something bigger something smaller a
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:17.960]  little bit of both but I I gotta think that Apple's customer base is large
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:23.240]  enough that they could afford to make more than a single consumer laptop right
[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:27.880]  I do too I really would because it's and I think it's by far and away they're
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:34.400]  best-selling thing you know and and I know that my family has three of those
[01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:38.680]  new retina MacBook Airs we have my son has one my wife has one my daughter has
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:43.640]  one it's like they're just there they're they're good even with the keyboards
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:46.280]  which you know we have an issue and presumably that'll be replaced but like
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:50.080]  they're good but it's a starting point and I feel like you know that was good
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:53.680]  to have a square one like okay at least we've got something people can buy now
[01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:59.480]  but could they go to you know that's a 13 could they do a 15 version of the of
[01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:04.280]  the air I think they could if they thought that it would it would sell and
[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:08.760]  that it would be a complementary piece yeah I don't know I think it would sell
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:11.840]  whether it would sell enough to really make it worthwhile for Apple I don't
[01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:15.680]  know it's always the question right is is it's not just would would a hundred
[01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:21.560]  people buy it it really is like is it enough to divert Apple's product
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:25.800]  designers to build a totally different skew and would it not just be
[01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:29.680]  cannibalizing existing sales that would go to other products and that's thought
[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:33.120]  that's the hard part of it but I do have to think that they probably got space in
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:38.640]  the consumer laptop world for more than one computer all right let me take a
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:47.800]  break here thank our third and final sponsor of the show Clearbank c-l-e-a-r
[01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:55.560]  ba and see hey here's some ideas how about your coffee shop running out of
[01:58:55.560 --> 01:58:59.680]  cold brew right when you get to the front of the line ah or you buy a new
[01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:05.640]  MacBook Pro the day before Apple changes the keyboard Clearbank can't change
[01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:11.360]  those things but Clearbank is changing one unfair thing how hard it is to get
[01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:15.440]  funding as an entrepreneur they know it's scary to put your house up as
[01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:18.460]  collateral for a bank loan and how scary and time-consuming it can be pitching
[01:59:18.460 --> 01:59:22.940]  investors not to mention giving up pieces of your company if the investor
[01:59:22.940 --> 01:59:29.040]  likes it Clearbank believes that fundraising can be easy they've created
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:32.640]  a new way for founders to raise money without tapping into their personal
[01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:37.900]  resources they can fund you anywhere from $10,000 to 10 million dollars in a
[01:59:37.900 --> 01:59:41.880]  single day all you need to do is fill out their 20-minute term sheet to get
[01:59:41.880 --> 01:59:47.520]  started Clearbank works with e-commerce companies software as service companies
[01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:52.400]  and yes mobile apps to probably of interest to more people who listen to
[01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:57.400]  this show they have funded thousands of entrepreneurs and they are on track to
[01:59:57.400 --> 02:00:04.160]  invest over 1 billion dollars in 2019 as a special gift to talk show listeners
[02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:08.600]  because they think you guys are pretty special and love James Bond to
[02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:13.080]  qualifying companies that get approved by Clearbank will get $1,000 of
[02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:19.680]  additional capital to sign up visit clearbank.com slash talk show that's
[02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:27.560]  clearbank bank.com slash talk show Clearbank stop pitching and get back to
[02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:33.560]  doing what you love growing your business let me just add if you do buy
[02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:36.400]  a MacBook Pro the day before they come out with a new keyboard you could take
[02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:45.960]  it back get the replacement but still that sucks my thanks to Clearbank for
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:53.080]  sponsoring the show so I don't have anything left on the Mac Pro or the the
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:58.480]  Pro display XCR I think we're like we're done I wanted I wanted to talk to you
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:04.480]  about was to me a fascinating Ming Chi Kuo report that came out last week nine
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:11.280]  to five Mac I guess had it first and you talked about it on the episode of
[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:15.560]  upgrade fine show one of my very favorites to be honest I'm not just
[02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:20.800]  saying that cuz you're here with Mike Hurley which just came out yesterday
[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:31.400]  episode 275 the title remove all of the holes which tells you which so I don't
[02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:35.720]  want to cover all of it again I just wow people should go listen to I don't want
[02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:39.960]  you to you know repeat I'm not gonna splice in your segment from from upgrade
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:43.320]  it's very fine but I think you guys left you left some stuff on the table here
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:48.160]  for me because you guys focused on this 2021 rumor from Ming Chi Kuo right that
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:51.840]  they're gonna do an iPhone with no port and we could talk about it briefly but
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:56.760]  you had your whole segment and title of your episode obviously comes from that
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:02:06.000]  but they're the 2020 rumors to me are fascinating so right now Apple's current
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:10.680]  lineup of current year phones the the and this has been true since the iPhone
[02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:18.360]  10 then the 10s introduced the pro max where you've got the OLED displays at
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:24.000]  five point eight inches as the smaller I won't call it small and six point five
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  inches as the large one and then they've come out with the what was last year the
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:40.120]  10 are but now just called the iPhone 11 an LCD screen right between the two at
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:45.760]  six point one inches diagonal all these phones share a common design language
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:50.400]  with the rounded corners and a notch at the top for the sensor array for face ID
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:53.840]  and because they have face ID they don't need touch ID and because they don't
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:57.440]  need touch ID and they go edge to edge they got rid of the home buttons and
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:03.800]  they have really there's a line in the sand where the iPhone 10 was sort of
[02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:11.080]  like the real iPhone 2.0 where they've kind of redesigned the fundamental way
[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:16.800]  that you interact with the device the 1.0 which was great and is still great
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:22.920]  and still popular is you tap an app and it opens the app and then you tap the
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:28.000]  home button click the home button and you go back to the home screen and you
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:35.440]  can tap another app and the new one you it's all these swipe gestures my mom has
[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:43.320]  an iPhone 6 and she has a weird battery issue where her phone I needed to restore
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:47.400]  it I won't waste a lot of time on this upgrade but her battery was running down
[02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:52.200]  within hours it was like a full food go from a hundred percent to zero in like
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:56.500]  three or four hours and it was all attributed to mail running in the
[02:03:56.500 --> 02:04:00.360]  background like when you check in in the system preferences in the battery
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:03.440]  section and it says who's doing stuff and mail is running in the background
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:08.480]  and I couldn't I couldn't figure out what why I emptied her inbox and put it
[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:11.840]  all in the archive I don't know what was going on but she didn't have anything on
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:17.400]  her phone anyway really she had almost no apps so like a restore and not
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:22.000]  restoring from backup just restoring her iCloud credentials pretty much got her
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:27.440]  everything she had if not if not it literally everything I did that and it
[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:32.840]  stopped draining the battery like that and also the battery health was 88%
[02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:37.120]  which isn't bad for a couple of year old iPhone 6 certainly not worth getting it
[02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:42.120]  replaced yet but the weird thing is now that I've restored it the battery does
[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:50.800]  last for days in idle like on standby but it runs down from a hundred to one
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:56.320]  percent if you put the battery meter up in the thing within about 12 hours so it
[02:04:56.320 --> 02:04:59.680]  goes from a hundred percent to 1% and there were a couple of times where I
[02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:02.400]  thought well damn this I'm gonna take I have to take this to the store and
[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:06.160]  either get her either convinced her to just buy a new phone now that this is
[02:05:06.160 --> 02:05:10.080]  older or at least get the battery replaced in this but then I stopped
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:14.120]  resetting it when it got to 1% say how come I keep luckily finding this when it
[02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:17.760]  gets to 1% how this is weird I just have it on the kitchen counter and every
[02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:20.940]  couple of hours I take a peek at it and see where the battery is at how come I
[02:05:20.940 --> 02:05:26.080]  keep catching it at 1% that seems unlikely and it turns out I let it go
[02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:30.520]  it went for four days at 1% now of course it obviously wasn't going for
[02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:34.800]  four days at 1% it's like somehow it's it's it's lost its ability to accurately
[02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:41.840]  gauge how long the battery lasts right so anyway that story aside so I don't
[02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:46.200]  have a solution to that so if anybody has a solution you can tell me but
[02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:50.120]  anyway I've spent a lot of time using an iPhone 6 in the last few weeks because
[02:05:50.120 --> 02:05:54.600]  of this and I can't it's gotten to the point where I cannot I just can't get
[02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:59.240]  used to it I can't get used to getting control center to pull down I keep
[02:05:59.240 --> 02:06:03.880]  swiping up even though there's a home button like for the first couple leave
[02:06:03.880 --> 02:06:10.800]  for the first while after I switched to an iPhone 10 I could I could go back to
[02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:16.080]  a touch button a home screen button one and you know within a minute or two
[02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:18.520]  I'd be like okay I remember how this works you double click the button and
[02:06:18.520 --> 02:06:22.600]  now you're multitasking now I it's like I can't even use it it's like I'm using
[02:06:22.600 --> 02:06:27.520]  the mouse with the wrong hand or something like that but all of these
[02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:32.880]  phones are in this new era it is a 2.0 era of the basic paradigm of how the
[02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:41.880]  iPhone system works right so there's an iPhone which Minchi quo has been calling
[02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:47.160]  the SE 2 supposedly coming out early next year which if it follows the
[02:06:47.160 --> 02:06:53.240]  original SE it would be like March or maybe early April and it's has a home
[02:06:53.240 --> 02:06:58.080]  button supposedly you know and with touch ID and it looks just like an
[02:06:58.080 --> 02:07:05.040]  iPhone 8 and there's a rumor I think that the Mac site Japanese Mac site Mac
[02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:10.800]  otakara says they heard it from an unquote informed source that Apple will
[02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:16.840]  be calling it the iPhone 9 I don't think that's a crazy idea I think for a lot of
[02:07:16.840 --> 02:07:22.160]  people like my mom I think that could be the perfect phone because I don't she
[02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:25.640]  doesn't want to upgrade to a new paradigm and again I don't think it
[02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:28.880]  would take I don't think it's a bad idea I don't think it's unusable by typical
[02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:33.880]  people but people like my mom don't want anything new like that they don't want
[02:07:33.880 --> 02:07:38.000]  to change they're just they fear it they fear they're like fear the unfilmed
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:46.600]  familiarity and it's a turn-off yeah that's the beauty of the SE concept
[02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:50.280]  right it's like we're gonna take that old phone that you like and if that's
[02:07:50.280 --> 02:07:53.360]  what you like we'll just put some new stuff in it but it still looks like the
[02:07:53.360 --> 02:07:58.120]  old one and now the SE as we think of it which is like the iPhone 5 like it's so
[02:07:58.120 --> 02:08:02.800]  old at this point that that's not really plausible but that you could now the
[02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:09.200]  throwback is to the six seven eight air right which was really unchanged for
[02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:15.360]  four years right six seven six six s seven eight was four generations with
[02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:20.200]  the same form factor you know with right plus and non plus sizes I presume that
[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:23.880]  this new SE is not going to have a plus variant that'll just be the smaller
[02:08:23.880 --> 02:08:29.240]  variant yeah I'd imagine and that's what what the quo rumor is yeah I think that
[02:08:29.240 --> 02:08:33.880]  this years long it's been at least a year this idea of an SE 2 coming out in
[02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:38.200]  early 2020 has really confused a lot of people about just what an SE phone
[02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:42.840]  iPhone is whether they call it the SE 2 or use some kind of name like that
[02:08:42.840 --> 02:08:47.880]  because we know people who are enthusiasts who really really think
[02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:52.320]  about these things and care about like oh I really really love my phone who
[02:08:52.320 --> 02:09:01.720]  really loved that small 4-inch iPhone 5 5 s se size yep and really really wanted
[02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:07.360]  the SE 2 to keep that alive and there I think they've all come to grips even
[02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:10.000]  before it's come out I would just based on the rumors that that isn't gonna
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:13.760]  happen because that's not what an SE phone is whether you want to call these
[02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:18.560]  SE phones or whatever it's exactly what you just said where it's the it's really
[02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:22.520]  like the phone from two or three years ago that a lot of people still like whatever
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:29.320]  that phone was yeah yeah and that's the it's the challenge there is that there
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:32.860]  those are two different things which is I like a small phone and I just like it
[02:09:32.860 --> 02:09:37.200]  the way I like the old one can we keep that around a little bit longer and I
[02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:41.840]  think it's clear based on these reports that I like a small phone is not what's
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:49.080]  happening here it's can we keep the past generation of shape and design alive a
[02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:54.420]  little bit longer at a low price for the people who want that product and the
[02:09:54.420 --> 02:09:58.520]  interesting thing with the SE a couple years ago was that whatever you I
[02:09:58.520 --> 02:10:02.240]  forget whatever year whatever year it came out it came out with the top of the
[02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:09.640]  line a series CPU from five or six months earlier and me saying a series
[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:15.800]  they're triggered Siri of course my device of course and that's the rumor
[02:10:15.800 --> 02:10:22.040]  with this you know iPhone 9 iPhone se2 whatever you want to call it that it's
[02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:30.100]  going to have the what are we up to now the a a 1313 I think yeah yeah so
[02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:35.800]  basically it's gonna be an iPhone 11 phone 11 except in an iPhone 8 form
[02:10:35.800 --> 02:10:41.000]  factor and maybe touch ID and well certainly with a lesser camera because
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:48.440]  it's only gonna have one camera lens right that to me is what these SE phones
[02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:57.400]  are is keeping that alive so Ming Chi closed 2020 rumors and here's the thing
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:11:02.160]  Ming Chi quo is not always perfect but where he's seemingly really really
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:06.920]  accurate is displays and it just seems as I've said this before I'll say it
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:10.760]  again it seems to me like I'm sure he has sources outside the display industry
[02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:15.680]  but he's got really good really good sources in the display industry because
[02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:21.120]  he's been right about displays I can't remember the last time he was wrong
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:31.320]  about displays 5.4 new phones for 2020 not counting SE phones we're talking
[02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:35.120]  about I believe these are all phones that would come out in at the September
[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:43.480]  iPhone event 5.4 inches with two cameras on the back so that's smaller then and
[02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:48.840]  these are all OLED by the way no no LCD all OLED so I believe they would that
[02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:54.120]  means they would all be 10 class phones meaning no home button flip up from the
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:12:01.120]  bottom pull down from the right for control center etc face ID face ID 5.4
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:08.880]  that would be a new smaller than ever version of this class of phone but only
[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:13.120]  two cameras on the back so probably almost certainly a lower price somewhat
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:24.040]  price price something like the what we now call the iPhone 11 to 6.1 inch OLED
[02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:31.360]  displays one of them with two cameras so I believe very clearly that is the
[02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:36.200]  successor to what we now call the iPhone 11 same size 6.1 inches but with an OLED
[02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:43.760]  instead of LCD and a two camera system on the back then another 6.1 inch phone
[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:48.760]  with the triple lens camera setup on the back as well as something called a time
[02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:53.960]  of flight 3d sensing technology that's let's just call it depth advanced depth
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:13:00.440]  sensor on the back sure and then a 6.7 inch with the same triple lens camera
[02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:05.280]  setup so if all of this is true I think it's very clear here's what I think the
[02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:13.220]  2020 if quo is right this is fascinating to me the the 2020 displays we are the
[02:13:13.220 --> 02:13:24.380]  2020 iPhones would be two of the 10 are regular old non pro 11 class phones the
[02:13:24.380 --> 02:13:30.520]  one that we've had since the 10 are and now the 11 at 6.1 inches but upgraded to
[02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:40.200]  OLED on the front and a new smaller one at 5.4 inches right but unfortunately
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:45.560]  for those of us who have kind of bemoaned even the increase in size to
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:51.040]  5.8 inches it seems like the successor to the pro phones the two pro phones are
[02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:57.480]  going to increase in size by a third of an inch to 6.1 and then go from 6.5 to
[02:13:57.480 --> 02:14:06.260]  6.7 for the max right so the idea here is that the the one that I use and you
[02:14:06.260 --> 02:14:13.540]  may use this to the the 6.1 right or the no the 5.8 which is the iPhone 10 the
[02:14:13.540 --> 02:14:20.320]  iPhone 10 not not max right just iPhone 10 size which is already bigger than the
[02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:25.760]  iPhone 8 right is gonna they're not gonna make that one anymore they're
[02:14:25.760 --> 02:14:30.160]  gonna make it the size that we think of now is the iPhone 11 or the 10 are size
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:37.040]  right and that is gonna be the small one and then pro max one is gonna get even
[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:40.600]  bigger because I which makes sense to me because people who want the big phone
[02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:45.080]  probably always want it to be an even bigger phone and then in exchange for
[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:50.080]  that the 11 which is currently available only in that one size is gonna get a
[02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:55.640]  little buddy yeah who is actually probably in the ballpark or maybe
[02:14:55.640 --> 02:15:02.640]  slightly larger than the that kind of classic iPhone 6 7 8 size yep but a 10
[02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:09.560]  class yeah right corner to corner round corner display OLED to camera system on
[02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:13.280]  the back which I presume will be the same I think it has proven to be the
[02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:18.040]  right decision and is extremely popular to have the second lens be the ultra
[02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:25.360]  wide-angle instead of telephoto that's it's you know it all makes sense it's
[02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:29.120]  not fascinating in the sense of why in the world would they do that except for
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:34.600]  the fact that god damn it I wish that the best pro one was not bigger right
[02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:38.120]  well I think this is if this is their strategy I think that is the question
[02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:42.900]  I've got about how they market this stuff because I get if if you're
[02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:47.160]  shopping based on I want the cutting-edge features so I want the iPhone
[02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:52.160]  Pro then you know and you like a smaller phone you're gonna get the 6.1 inch and
[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:55.400]  it's gonna be bigger than the phone you've got now but if your number one
[02:15:55.400 --> 02:16:01.640]  thing is like I want the smaller phone and you can save money and you still get
[02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:06.600]  two cameras then this is my question because I'm that person I look at this
[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:10.760]  and I think I'm I just gonna get the iPhone you know 12 base model next year
[02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:14.720]  rather than the the pro and if it's different if it's like yeah it's a
[02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:19.760]  easier to hold in my hand and it isn't getting bigger in size maybe I don't
[02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:24.120]  know it's an interesting question yeah I also it occurs to me and I actually
[02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:27.140]  broke out a ruler and it's stupid because you can't really measure the
[02:16:27.140 --> 02:16:30.800]  stuff of the ruler but I broke out a ruler and I started thinking like what
[02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:38.560]  if the pro ones have more of an edge-to-edge display like less of a
[02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:44.480]  black bezel between where the display is like in the same way that the iPhone 10
[02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:51.380]  are and 11 LCDs have more of a bezel than the OLED ones what if on these pro
[02:16:51.380 --> 02:16:58.000]  ones the the bezel goes even closer to the edge almost like almost or even does
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:06.120]  wrap around a little bit like some a lot of Android phones do right so that maybe
[02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:13.160]  the actual physical size of the device is I want to say isn't larger at all but
[02:17:13.160 --> 02:17:18.400]  I found it hard with a ruler to find a third of an inch diagonally but you can
[02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:22.760]  kind of come close you kind of get maybe a quarter of an inch right there's sort
[02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:26.480]  of an eight by maybe about an eighth of an inch I'm looking at it now of bezel
[02:17:26.480 --> 02:17:33.680]  around here the 11 is not a I mean it's bigger than I'm used to but it's not a
[02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:38.080]  terrible size it's it's it's you know but for people who already think the
[02:17:38.080 --> 02:17:41.440]  phone is too large this actually might be a really nice thing saying no we're
[02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:45.080]  gonna have a mainline one that's 5.4 like that's gonna be a relief for all
[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:49.800]  those people who never liked having to use a larger phone even if it's not as
[02:17:49.800 --> 02:17:54.360]  small as the five was right I all I'm saying is I think it's possible by
[02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:58.440]  expanding into the bezels and then and then it would visually separate the two
[02:17:58.440 --> 02:18:04.120]  right then there's so if there's an iPhone 12 and an iPhone 12 Pro and
[02:18:04.120 --> 02:18:11.360]  they're both 6.1 inch displays the pro could be visually more impressive
[02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:16.040]  by having this display that expands even further to the corners of the devices
[02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:20.240]  and is actually a slightly physically smaller device that is maybe only
[02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:26.960]  slightly bigger than the 5.8 please please please let that be please let
[02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:32.680]  that be true but you know and it is you know and why would Apple do that well
[02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:37.840]  you know there are some people who really like that aesthetic and at least
[02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:42.720]  you know and as long as it does a good job of not recognizing hand gestures
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:47.320]  when you don't want them and stuff like that you know but in the realm of people
[02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:51.600]  who look at all phones as opposed to only judging iPhones and sort of
[02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:57.080]  ignoring the Android world the fact that the you know even the the 11 Pro and Pro
[02:18:57.080 --> 02:19:05.520]  Max have in the premium Android world large bezels it's a fact so I'm
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:10.400]  optimistic that just you can't go by the corner-to-corner screen dimensions to
[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:16.320]  judge the increase in physical device to vent dimensions is what I'm saying sure
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:19.840]  I can see that but maybe I'm just saying that to myself because that's what I
[02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:27.280]  want well let's so the the and just for reference here the Samsung Galaxy Note
[02:19:27.280 --> 02:19:34.440]  10 plus is a 6.8 hmm so if you're talking about like what's the
[02:19:34.440 --> 02:19:38.880]  competition in terms of the big screen phone by going to six point from six
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:45.280]  point five to six point seven they are pushing the Pro Max up to you know
[02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:50.440]  Samsung Galaxy kind of size yeah which for the on the Galaxy Note the large one
[02:19:50.440 --> 02:19:53.600]  and that's you know there's a market there's a market there are there are
[02:19:53.600 --> 02:19:59.160]  people for whom a phone can never be too big and if that's on me but I know some
[02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:03.680]  people like that and you know Apple I think it's smart to chase those people
[02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:09.680]  because they want the big phone yeah and you know the note is a good device to
[02:20:09.680 --> 02:20:14.640]  look at for what a more edge-to-edge wrap around the side a bit display could
[02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:22.680]  look like right so you know that that anyway that's my hope anyway I had a bit
[02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:29.200]  of as we call it in the industry although I don't usually use it follow
[02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:36.280]  out and I was with you and with you and Mike on up on the hereto on the
[02:20:36.280 --> 02:20:47.080]  priorly mentioned upgrade 275 was was on the the scheduling and the idea that as
[02:20:47.080 --> 02:20:51.280]  Ming Chi Kuo seems to suggest that Apple has plans for future first half of the
[02:20:51.280 --> 02:20:56.640]  year new iPhones I think Mike Mike seemed to interpret that as separating
[02:20:56.640 --> 02:21:03.720]  like the 11 and the 11 Pro right doing the 11 style phones earlier in the year
[02:21:03.720 --> 02:21:08.960]  and the pro ones in September and I think if you think about it it's that's
[02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:18.200]  not it at all I think it is about regularizing these SE phones to have and
[02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:22.240]  if you really think about if you think about the September new phones which
[02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:29.400]  have been the case for many many years now they're effectively the 2020 model
[02:21:29.400 --> 02:21:33.880]  year phones right like all the enthusiasts jump and buy them
[02:21:33.880 --> 02:21:40.240]  immediately in the fourth quarter of the calendar year right I pre-ordered mine
[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:44.320]  that on day one sure but most of them these are the phones that are going to
[02:21:44.320 --> 02:21:50.520]  be on sale as the top-of-the-line iPhone from January until you know September
[02:21:50.520 --> 02:21:57.280]  11th or 12th or 13th or whatever whenever they hold the event so for most
[02:21:57.280 --> 02:22:03.720]  of the 2020 calendar year that these are the premier phones so I think that this
[02:22:03.720 --> 02:22:10.680]  schedule this SE schedule for lack of a better word is about getting a lower
[02:22:10.680 --> 02:22:19.320]  tier but still top-of-the-line chipset in the market at a lower price but not
[02:22:19.320 --> 02:22:23.960]  wasting time at September with even more phones right and they've already seemed
[02:22:23.960 --> 02:22:30.760]  to be expanding to four phones at the top end right so who wants five right
[02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:35.000]  group and one of them is old and lesson well and he has that rumor which I
[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:39.000]  actually think is a really interesting rumor which is the idea that in 2021
[02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:43.040]  they're gonna do another SE style phone but what they're gonna do is they're
[02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:50.440]  gonna take the the home button out and put touch ID on like one of the side
[02:22:50.440 --> 02:22:56.920]  buttons yeah which is that's also kind of wacky but an interesting idea and
[02:22:56.920 --> 02:23:00.280]  you know it's not something I would have come up with but I think it's an
[02:23:00.280 --> 02:23:05.160]  interesting idea I think you're right I think it's it would be awfully hard to
[02:23:05.160 --> 02:23:10.760]  separate the like the 11 and the 11 Pro because you'd be you know using an older
[02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:13.920]  chip generation in one of them presumably the lower end one which
[02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:18.280]  means it's even more of an afterthought and I don't think that's the message
[02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:21.800]  they want to sell it didn't you know but but there's room for more iPhone
[02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:25.520]  rollout I think what we're seeing here like if this described thing happens
[02:23:25.520 --> 02:23:30.400]  Apple is going to say we have five different iPhones and we'll roll the big
[02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:33.800]  ones out in the fall and then there'll be some other ones you know or at least
[02:23:33.800 --> 02:23:36.640]  one other one that's gonna come out later and you don't need to worry about
[02:23:36.640 --> 02:23:40.680]  it too much but we're gonna do that too and I think this is where we are now is
[02:23:40.680 --> 02:23:43.920]  there used to be an iPhone and the iPhones keep growing because Apple
[02:23:43.920 --> 02:23:48.960]  realizes that they you know different people want different things out of the
[02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:52.320]  iPhone these days and and that's a one way to sell more iPhones is to give
[02:23:52.320 --> 02:23:56.160]  people these choices so that they can find one that they actually want to
[02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:59.380]  upgrade to great and it's you know it's their most popular most important
[02:23:59.380 --> 02:24:05.360]  financially most used product yeah and yet it's the one that until very
[02:24:05.360 --> 02:24:09.880]  recently had had the fewest options I mean because honestly even I mean I
[02:24:09.880 --> 02:24:13.360]  don't want to I've just never been a fan of the plus sized ones I like the max
[02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:16.360]  size one even better there's something about the dimensions of the plus one
[02:24:16.360 --> 02:24:23.040]  that really never sat well with me personally but even then it still was
[02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:26.160]  just two sizes of the same thing and yes the plus ones had slightly better
[02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:30.440]  cameras and yes I still won't stop complaining about that as someone who
[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:35.720]  wouldn't buy a plus but wanted the best camera but it wasn't nearly as much
[02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:41.400]  variety as we have even just today before this 2020 rumor of what might be
[02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:50.200]  coming but the starting last year with the 10r and the 10s and 10s max was a
[02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:56.320]  much wider variety of options for hey I want a new excellent top-of-the-line
[02:24:56.320 --> 02:25:04.080]  chipset excellent camera you know iPhone way more variety there in terms of well
[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:10.480]  I would be delighted to spend $300 less and have this excellent LCD screen with
[02:25:10.480 --> 02:25:14.640]  slightly larger bezels you know here I'm looking at it in the store side by side
[02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:19.160]  yeah I'll just take this one right that's a great option yeah and yes they
[02:25:19.160 --> 02:25:25.800]  raise the prices to get the OLED ones to the prices that they're at now but I
[02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:29.040]  think it makes way more sense and if they even as we said that there's you
[02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:33.160]  know we could always find phones that that we wish they were in a dream world
[02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:36.760]  that they'd still make one with a 4-inch diagonal screen for people who really do
[02:25:36.760 --> 02:25:42.040]  want a tiny little iPhone but this sounds like a much like a much more
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:45.880]  robust lineup and as we were talking earlier about MacBooks I really feel
[02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:49.920]  like there's a market for all of these phones if they come out as rumored I
[02:25:49.920 --> 02:25:54.320]  think so I think so I think that the number of people sheer number of people
[02:25:54.320 --> 02:25:59.520]  who buy iPhones right like you don't have to have a huge slice of the market
[02:25:59.520 --> 02:26:04.200]  for it to be a huge number of people and if the net result is you sell more
[02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:08.120]  iPhones that's what they want right like if they're not gonna make an iPhone that
[02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:12.040]  literally is gonna do nothing but take sales away from the two iPhones that are
[02:26:12.040 --> 02:26:16.760]  bracketing it like right why would you even do that unless unless it's pulling
[02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:20.000]  a lot of people up from a cheaper model and you're making more profit but I
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:24.920]  think they're doing what you know it's the opposite of what Samsung did which
[02:26:24.920 --> 02:26:27.680]  is which is just throw a whole bunch of phone models out there and see which
[02:26:27.680 --> 02:26:31.240]  ones sold and then they learned from it with Apple it's sort of starting very
[02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:36.080]  focused on like a product that they try to sell to everybody and realizing now
[02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:38.760]  that they can't they can't do that anymore so if we have five brand new
[02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:42.560]  iPhones in 2020 you know bring it on I think that's I think that's good and I
[02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:46.160]  think it's good for Apple at this point and it's in its lifespan all right now
[02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:55.360]  let me complain about the woes of me how the fuck am I gonna review for iPhones
[02:26:55.360 --> 02:27:01.600]  you know it was nice two years ago when the when the XR came out before the
[02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:06.520]  XS right so there's like two different embargoes oh it's fantastic and plenty
[02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:10.800]  of time between them plenty of time between them mm-hmm oh please let these
[02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:18.760]  come out staggered please let them come out oh this I think to myself isn't it
[02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:22.160]  fun that I get to run this website all by myself and I can take credit for
[02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:27.880]  every word that's ever been written on it and then three iPhones come out at
[02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:30.980]  once yeah I think the good news is it looks like the plan here is that it's
[02:27:30.980 --> 02:27:34.080]  it's you know what they're really doing is varying the screen size and then
[02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:37.200]  they've got two models two models with two different screen sizes so it's not
[02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:40.920]  really four phones it's two phones which it already is so yeah we're already
[02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:44.680]  there yeah so my technique if this happens as scheduled we did the same
[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:49.560]  thing I did this year where I sort of skipped the pro aren't Pro Max and just
[02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:57.480]  did the regular 11 and 11 Pro comparison and pick the sizes I most wanted last
[02:27:57.480 --> 02:28:01.760]  but not least the heat Ming Chi Kuo has a 2021 rumor that the high-end
[02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:07.640]  presumably Pro iPhones will drop the lightning port and not not for USB C
[02:28:07.640 --> 02:28:12.820]  which I'm not surprised by but instead have no port whatsoever now you and Mike
[02:28:12.820 --> 02:28:16.800]  devoted a huge segment of upgrade to this and I really I thought it was
[02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:19.120]  excellent and so I don't want to rehash the whole thing we don't have to go into
[02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:22.560]  detail and you and I have already gone a little bit longer than than most
[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:26.600]  podcasts do here but I still think we can't let this go without I cannot
[02:28:26.600 --> 02:28:30.280]  publish a podcast after this report came out and not talk about the rumor of
[02:28:30.280 --> 02:28:35.000]  iPhones with no port here's my I've said this before I'll repeat myself very
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:40.120]  quickly I've never expected iPhones to go to USB C and I know that once the
[02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:45.880]  iPad pros did it certainly became more plausible and it became a maybe but
[02:28:45.880 --> 02:28:52.800]  Apple's explanation for why iPad pros got USB C from lightning is that they
[02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:59.360]  are geared as replacements or alternatives to PCs right and PCs need
[02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:06.920]  USB iPhones that and again I when in doubt take Apple at their word that
[02:29:06.920 --> 02:29:12.480]  description does not apply in any sense to iPhones and iPhones don't need the
[02:29:12.480 --> 02:29:16.740]  extra high charging they probably for thermal reasons maybe wouldn't use it
[02:29:16.740 --> 02:29:22.120]  even if they could mm-hmm like as far as I know maybe I'm wrong if I'm wrong
[02:29:22.120 --> 02:29:25.120]  somebody I guess will let me know on Twitter let me know on Twitter don't
[02:29:25.120 --> 02:29:32.200]  email me it's really a lot better for me but I don't think that Android phones
[02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:37.040]  with USB C ports can take advantage of say a 45 watt charger I just don't think
[02:29:37.040 --> 02:29:40.360]  that works I don't think it's feasible but if it is well I guess that would be
[02:29:40.360 --> 02:29:45.840]  a theory but we'll get back to that in a second when we talk about removing ports
[02:29:45.840 --> 02:29:48.700]  and it all together I just don't think it makes any sense and I think that the
[02:29:48.700 --> 02:29:53.500]  proprietariness of lightning and the avoiding the controversy the inevitable
[02:29:53.500 --> 02:30:00.600]  huge backlash from the normal person community who would object to and
[02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:05.860]  immediately deem a money grab a port change even if the port changes to the
[02:30:05.860 --> 02:30:10.440]  industry standard from a proprietary one
[02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:17.620]  you know like my my sister and brother-in-law were not angry but asked
[02:30:17.620 --> 02:30:20.760]  me like they were upset because they what they do is they upgrade every other
[02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:25.400]  year so my sister gets a new iPhone one year and then the next year her husband
[02:30:25.400 --> 02:30:28.920]  does and then the next year she does and they go like that well in the year when
[02:30:28.920 --> 02:30:32.020]  it was time for somebody to upgrade to the first one with lightning all of a
[02:30:32.020 --> 02:30:35.800]  sudden they're one charger in the kitchen couldn't charge both you know
[02:30:35.800 --> 02:30:39.840]  and they were upset by that people would see it the same way but anyway so I
[02:30:39.840 --> 02:30:43.640]  never thought USB C was in play I've been saying for a while now that it'll
[02:30:43.640 --> 02:30:49.780]  be lightning until they go to no ports at all I would not have pegged 2021 is
[02:30:49.780 --> 02:30:56.500]  when they went to no ports at all it's yeah I mean I would love to express
[02:30:56.500 --> 02:31:01.300]  massive skepticism about a report like this except we've got the model right
[02:31:01.300 --> 02:31:05.000]  which is the headphone jack like all of my feelings about this are the same
[02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.900]  feelings I had when there was the report that they were gonna get rid of the
[02:31:07.900 --> 02:31:12.700]  headphone jack and that was well that's that's preposterous think of all the
[02:31:12.700 --> 02:31:19.760]  reasons that you can't do that and you know but they did it like they did it
[02:31:19.760 --> 02:31:22.900]  and they put a dongle in the box and they made it work and I can come up with
[02:31:22.900 --> 02:31:27.560]  a big list of things about why this doesn't make any sense like carplay and
[02:31:27.560 --> 02:31:33.980]  surviving a complete crash where you need to reset the firmware and charging
[02:31:33.980 --> 02:31:39.100]  on an external battery pack or in a car or on an airplane water and or did you
[02:31:39.100 --> 02:31:43.040]  know yeah well waterproofing is like a reason why they could do it right like
[02:31:43.040 --> 02:31:48.100]  this like but the question is why why do it why right and the why for removing
[02:31:48.100 --> 02:31:50.720]  the headphone port there's a couple that I you know I think they're pretty
[02:31:50.720 --> 02:31:55.060]  obvious and the one they gave was about you know needing or at least wanting
[02:31:55.060 --> 02:31:59.620]  that space underneath the display because the traditional headphone jack
[02:31:59.620 --> 02:32:05.580]  really does go a long way in compared to any modern digital port which I think is
[02:32:05.580 --> 02:32:09.100]  legit and I don't think it means they couldn't do it right and that's the
[02:32:09.100 --> 02:32:13.960]  thing it's not that they couldn't do a headphone jack and still have these
[02:32:13.960 --> 02:32:16.940]  displays but I think it would make it much more difficult and it might
[02:32:16.940 --> 02:32:24.080]  compromise them in some way and the way that the the the current OLED ones curve
[02:32:24.080 --> 02:32:27.920]  under at the top and bottom really might prevent it unless they put the headphone
[02:32:27.920 --> 02:32:32.900]  jack on the side or something like that which is weird but I think ultimately it
[02:32:32.900 --> 02:32:38.000]  was really is a vision that hey the future is wireless headphones and it's
[02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:42.340]  so much better that we want to help push it there by getting rid of the headphone
[02:32:42.340 --> 02:32:48.800]  jack and Apple's done this in the past where you know it's sometimes more
[02:32:48.800 --> 02:32:53.060]  successfully sometimes less successfully like I think that the hey the only ports
[02:32:53.060 --> 02:32:57.660]  on MacBooks are going to be USB C hasn't worked out it hasn't been a disaster but
[02:32:57.660 --> 02:33:00.820]  it hasn't worked out as well as I think Apple would have anticipated when they
[02:33:00.820 --> 02:33:07.780]  first came out with a USB C only MacBook but like abandoning traditional ports
[02:33:07.780 --> 02:33:14.220]  and going into us with USB original USB with the iMac turned out great and I
[02:33:14.220 --> 02:33:20.100]  think it helped usher in the USB era I think dropping the headphone jack on
[02:33:20.100 --> 02:33:27.980]  iPhones and including headphones that do still work with it via lightning because
[02:33:27.980 --> 02:33:33.700]  the air pods are too expensive to include in the package it has helped I
[02:33:33.700 --> 02:33:38.660]  think usher in the air pods era I think it has helped and you can say well they
[02:33:38.660 --> 02:33:42.860]  just wanted to sell air pods but I I think air pods make people happy so it
[02:33:42.860 --> 02:33:48.100]  made like win-win it's like win-win for Apple they sell $160 hunt to $200 air
[02:33:48.100 --> 02:33:54.860]  pods or I guess up to $249 now but I people love their air pods right so
[02:33:54.860 --> 02:33:58.780]  they've ushered in a better era what's the better era that gets rushed ushered
[02:33:58.780 --> 02:34:05.140]  in by removing the charging jack I don't get it I yeah that's that's I mean I get
[02:34:05.140 --> 02:34:08.100]  I get the argument that you're saving space on the inside I get the argument
[02:34:08.100 --> 02:34:11.340]  that engineering wise not having to have a port that sticks out a very particular
[02:34:11.340 --> 02:34:15.740]  location gives you a lot more flexibility on the inside but yeah what
[02:34:15.740 --> 02:34:20.220]  headphones do you put in the box yes there's no lightning jack there has way
[02:34:20.220 --> 02:34:24.140]  there has to be a story to sell and I don't think we know it yet you know and
[02:34:24.140 --> 02:34:30.140]  it must involve some sort of wireless charging technology or contact charging
[02:34:30.140 --> 02:34:33.900]  technology you know with the smart connector type that's the best thing
[02:34:33.900 --> 02:34:37.380]  that I can come up with is what if they went to a smart connector style thing
[02:34:37.380 --> 02:34:40.860]  except that could handle way more power and and probably transfer way more data
[02:34:40.860 --> 02:34:45.980]  and also probably have some kind of a dongle II kind of thing that you that is
[02:34:45.980 --> 02:34:50.940]  either wireless or that you attach via that thing that because like carplay is
[02:34:50.940 --> 02:34:54.100]  a great example where you're you basically can't come out with an iPhone
[02:34:54.100 --> 02:34:58.260]  that doesn't work with more than half of the carplay cars that are out there
[02:34:58.260 --> 02:35:02.140]  because carplay is the wireless car pay has been around for a while almost
[02:35:02.140 --> 02:35:08.500]  nobody has wireless carplay right right and all of a sudden you buy a new car
[02:35:08.500 --> 02:35:12.460]  you buy a new iPhone and it's a huge downgrade where you go from carplay to
[02:35:12.460 --> 02:35:17.340]  no carplay and and charging speed is another one yeah okay huge okay why
[02:35:17.340 --> 02:35:21.620]  there are no Chi charging battery cases right is it's slow and it's inefficient
[02:35:21.620 --> 02:35:26.100]  it's just a bad idea so Apple would have to either there's a new Chi that we
[02:35:26.100 --> 02:35:29.980]  don't know about or that is coming or Apple would have to reinvent like they
[02:35:29.980 --> 02:35:34.300]  could do a mag safety kind of thing if they wanted to I don't know it's it is
[02:35:34.300 --> 02:35:38.700]  that for me I get hung up there are solutions here but I get up hung up on
[02:35:38.700 --> 02:35:43.660]  the why like why what is the benefit to the user in eliminating this port and I
[02:35:43.660 --> 02:35:47.140]  am having a hard time seeing it other than I mean waterproofing would be nice
[02:35:47.140 --> 02:35:50.860]  right to finally say because like if you drop your phone in the ocean today and
[02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:54.980]  it dies even though it's got all that water and dust resistance in it it's
[02:35:54.980 --> 02:35:59.420]  your fault and Apple won't fix it unless you pay them it's not warrantied even
[02:35:59.420 --> 02:36:03.060]  though they're water resistant water damage is not covered and like it would
[02:36:03.060 --> 02:36:06.740]  be great if the iPhone covered water damage and like no it's not gonna fail
[02:36:06.740 --> 02:36:12.100]  we promise and if getting rid of this port did that then I could sort of see
[02:36:12.100 --> 02:36:15.900]  that but even so that's quite a cost just to get waterproofing to be better
[02:36:15.900 --> 02:36:20.260]  and it's true that there's an example of an iOS device with no ports it's the
[02:36:20.260 --> 02:36:25.020]  Apple watch and it you know comes with its own custom charger and latches on
[02:36:25.020 --> 02:36:27.980]  the back but part of the reason they can latch on the back is that the back has
[02:36:27.980 --> 02:36:33.140]  like this big rump feeling line right now it's not flat yeah it's got a big
[02:36:33.140 --> 02:36:37.780]  round sensor blob on it and also by the way like I don't ever run betas on Apple
[02:36:37.780 --> 02:36:43.220]  watch in the summertime because if they if it dies like you can't do a reset
[02:36:43.220 --> 02:36:48.420]  right there's no port on it is that gonna happen to the iPhone too it's
[02:36:48.420 --> 02:36:53.380]  weird it's just again I would I would brush it off if it weren't for the fact
[02:36:53.380 --> 02:36:57.780]  that we just went through this and maybe this is gonna happen again but it
[02:36:57.780 --> 02:37:02.420]  hasn't come into focus yet about it like if this is true why is it true and I
[02:37:02.420 --> 02:37:06.860]  don't know I don't know why there's it's got to be a story that we don't know you
[02:37:06.860 --> 02:37:11.300]  know right that's that's to me the more intriguing thing and I do believe there
[02:37:11.300 --> 02:37:17.620]  will be I believe you know what's the over-under it without the ring to quote
[02:37:17.620 --> 02:37:21.220]  rumor I would have said the rumor it get rid of the lightning port for no port at
[02:37:21.220 --> 02:37:28.740]  all it may be like 20 25 sure you know give it five more years and we'd have
[02:37:28.740 --> 02:37:33.460]  wireless charging that could compete with you know current heist quote-unquote
[02:37:33.460 --> 02:37:37.180]  high-speed charging for phones but you can't go from current high-speed
[02:37:37.180 --> 02:37:42.060]  charging for phones and say the fastest you get is Chi like you know I just had
[02:37:42.060 --> 02:37:46.020]  one yet just this week it happens maybe once a month as I put my phone on the
[02:37:46.020 --> 02:37:50.580]  nightstand Chi charger wrong and it doesn't light up and I've it's been so
[02:37:50.580 --> 02:37:54.620]  long since I've done that that I'm not paying attention and I've got the sound
[02:37:54.620 --> 02:37:59.220]  off so I don't hear anything like I don't hear the lack of you know
[02:37:59.220 --> 02:38:03.340]  verification that it's on and I wake I woke up in the morning and my phone was
[02:38:03.340 --> 02:38:07.220]  almost dead now I didn't have to go anywhere because I work at home but if I
[02:38:07.220 --> 02:38:10.700]  had to go somewhere I would want to be able to charge that up to like 50% very
[02:38:10.700 --> 02:38:14.940]  quickly like I would didn't put it on the Chi charger when I realized what
[02:38:14.940 --> 02:38:18.780]  happened I took it down to the kitchen and put it on an 18 watt charger I still
[02:38:18.780 --> 02:38:22.580]  have a lightning charger next to my Chi chargers and you know often it's for
[02:38:22.580 --> 02:38:27.860]  other devices but like sometimes it's the oh no my phone's at 10% well I guess
[02:38:27.860 --> 02:38:30.900]  it didn't stay on the Chi charger last night and I really need to top it up
[02:38:30.900 --> 02:38:35.460]  before I go and you'd lose you can't lose that right and not to mention like
[02:38:35.460 --> 02:38:39.020]  I said people who live on like that Apple came out with a battery case well
[02:38:39.020 --> 02:38:43.380]  they don't do you know Chi charging battery cases because you lose a lot of
[02:38:43.380 --> 02:38:47.940]  the power it's really inefficient and it's super slow so maybe Apple has
[02:38:47.940 --> 02:38:51.780]  invented something new that that's the that's part of the what is the story
[02:38:51.780 --> 02:38:54.900]  here and that's why when I when I mentioned and you mentioned like
[02:38:54.900 --> 02:38:57.740]  something kind of like the smart connector from different it's like okay
[02:38:57.740 --> 02:39:01.020]  well what if Apple said you know there's a better way when you do need an
[02:39:01.020 --> 02:39:05.580]  accessory which is we made up we made a thing that's a magnetically attached
[02:39:05.580 --> 02:39:10.220]  contact thing it's not a port per se most people are never going to use it
[02:39:10.220 --> 02:39:15.620]  but it's there for this adapter and for carplay and for for a battery case to
[02:39:15.620 --> 02:39:19.460]  use and we've designed a battery case that uses it like I could I could maybe
[02:39:19.460 --> 02:39:22.620]  see that but that better be really great right because they're gonna need to
[02:39:22.620 --> 02:39:26.540]  drive adoption of that very quickly and but then the other thing that that runs
[02:39:26.540 --> 02:39:30.060]  into is the fact that most people the overwhelming majority people want a case
[02:39:30.060 --> 02:39:34.900]  on their phones and they don't want you know like Apple Apple's own cases now
[02:39:34.900 --> 02:39:39.860]  leave the bottom lip open they round the corner but leave that whole area from
[02:39:39.860 --> 02:39:43.180]  speaker to speaker and the light right or it open but a lot of people don't
[02:39:43.180 --> 02:39:46.740]  want that they don't want a case like that because they really they feel
[02:39:46.740 --> 02:39:51.500]  secure when there's a lip all the way around I mean I guess if they came out
[02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:55.140]  with a phone without that that needed the bottom to be open to magnetically
[02:39:55.140 --> 02:39:59.900]  connect you know they would just have to suck it up but it would also seem to
[02:39:59.900 --> 02:40:05.860]  rule out the entire category of truly protective cases you know the the sort
[02:40:05.860 --> 02:40:09.140]  of right yeah you can actually unless you unless you have like a smart
[02:40:09.140 --> 02:40:14.300]  connector where I don't know do all the cases have their own like Pat metal
[02:40:14.300 --> 02:40:18.540]  pass-through something like it's it all starts like I can believe that it could
[02:40:18.540 --> 02:40:21.780]  happen but when I start thinking about the details it all starts to unravel and
[02:40:21.780 --> 02:40:24.700]  it comes kind of back to like why are we going through this what are we what's
[02:40:24.700 --> 02:40:28.460]  the benefit of going through this I don't yeah what's the benefit I don't
[02:40:28.460 --> 02:40:31.900]  get it you know I do get the waterproofing thing but I just don't
[02:40:31.900 --> 02:40:35.540]  think it's as important you know and you know as a watch nerd I know the history
[02:40:35.540 --> 02:40:39.300]  with watches were long long time there was no such thing as a waterproof watch
[02:40:39.300 --> 02:40:43.680]  and then with wristwatches came out and you know people would just forget they
[02:40:43.680 --> 02:40:46.940]  had their watch on and like jump in the pool or something and shit you've just
[02:40:46.940 --> 02:40:53.180]  just ruined your watch right you know and now I've never I'm thinking in the
[02:40:53.180 --> 02:40:55.780]  back man yeah I think it's true I've never owned a watch that isn't
[02:40:55.780 --> 02:40:58.940]  waterproof and I've been wearing a watch since I was like 13 years old
[02:40:58.940 --> 02:41:02.580]  actually I guess I had a Superman watch when I was seven years old that that
[02:41:02.580 --> 02:41:08.620]  wasn't wasn't waterproof so let me let me put an asterisk there which I wish I
[02:41:08.620 --> 02:41:14.420]  wish to God I still own because wouldn't that be adorable but you know from 13
[02:41:14.420 --> 02:41:19.500]  on buying Casio digital watches I've never owned one it isn't waterproof but
[02:41:19.500 --> 02:41:22.020]  I just don't think that's as important for the phone or at least not so
[02:41:22.020 --> 02:41:25.900]  important as to get rid of the port and it can be solved for those who need it
[02:41:25.900 --> 02:41:29.420]  if it's a relatively small group by putting by making it more water
[02:41:29.420 --> 02:41:32.780]  resistant so that even though it's not covered and this is what they've done if
[02:41:32.780 --> 02:41:37.300]  you drop it in the toilet there's a good chance it won't be dead now where you
[02:41:37.300 --> 02:41:40.020]  know five years ago that wasn't true it was gonna be dead right away there's a
[02:41:40.020 --> 02:41:43.580]  pretty good chance it won't be dead and that if you need absolute guaranteed I
[02:41:43.580 --> 02:41:47.580]  want to take this snorkeling in Hawaii you get and they're available on Amazon
[02:41:47.580 --> 02:41:50.220]  and they're pretty cheap you get a waterproof case and then you use it in
[02:41:50.220 --> 02:41:54.300]  the waterproof case and it's okay and that sort of solves the problem without
[02:41:54.300 --> 02:41:58.140]  forcing every single owner of this product to go through a transition and
[02:41:58.140 --> 02:42:02.220]  again this makes me feel very confident it won't happen except I felt this way
[02:42:02.220 --> 02:42:05.980]  about the headphone jack so yeah and speaking of the headphone jack this
[02:42:05.980 --> 02:42:09.460]  would also mean that they'd have to put air pods in the box with the iPhone um
[02:42:09.460 --> 02:42:13.620]  yeah unless there was some other weird magnetic something or other or they made
[02:42:13.620 --> 02:42:17.180]  a cheap air pod or I don't know what like they just said if you don't already
[02:42:17.180 --> 02:42:21.580]  own air pods guess what you're spending another hundred and some dollars I mean
[02:42:21.580 --> 02:42:27.380]  it's not you know in presuming if this debuts only at the pro end we're talking
[02:42:27.380 --> 02:42:34.700]  about thousand dollar plus phones and assuming that by 2021 the current lower
[02:42:34.700 --> 02:42:40.540]  end current $159 air pods are actually a lot cheaper for Apple to make it's maybe
[02:42:40.540 --> 02:42:45.020]  not preposterous to think they'd include them in the box but then on the other
[02:42:45.020 --> 02:42:49.860]  hand it feels ridiculous that for those of us who already own iPad I you know
[02:42:49.860 --> 02:42:56.220]  air pods that I don't want I always felt a little wasteful getting all the extra
[02:42:56.220 --> 02:43:02.060]  wired earbuds that I didn't use but this that seems extra use use for this yeah
[02:43:02.060 --> 02:43:06.980]  yeah I can't see them doing it and let's not forget they also would need to put a
[02:43:06.980 --> 02:43:10.620]  charging solution of some kind in the box and again right she charged she
[02:43:10.620 --> 02:43:13.620]  charger in the box doesn't seem right but you know maybe they could make a
[02:43:13.620 --> 02:43:17.980]  cheap one or do they have an alternative charging mechanism and what is that and
[02:43:17.980 --> 02:43:24.660]  like it's not unsolvable but like complicated problems to solve which
[02:43:24.660 --> 02:43:31.500]  brings me back to why are we doing all of this again and I still don't know it's
[02:43:31.500 --> 02:43:35.740]  a fascinating rumor and you know sometimes people latch on to stories and
[02:43:35.740 --> 02:43:40.700]  I don't know why but I can see why this one exploded on Twitter with sure people
[02:43:40.700 --> 02:43:43.380]  get mad people are like mad at Apple about it it's like we don't know Apple's
[02:43:43.380 --> 02:43:46.660]  doing this like I think it's a good intellectual exercise because maybe they
[02:43:46.660 --> 02:43:50.940]  are and it's nice to ask like okay if they are why and what would that mean
[02:43:50.940 --> 02:43:55.780]  and all of that but like we're talking about September 2021 here and it's one
[02:43:55.780 --> 02:44:00.660]  report so far for all we know this is a different product or it's just a test or
[02:44:00.660 --> 02:44:06.020]  it's something that was misunderstood and this isn't gonna happen you know or
[02:44:06.020 --> 02:44:10.940]  or it's true like the headphone jack we just don't know all right Jason thank
[02:44:10.940 --> 02:44:15.140]  you I thank you I thank all of our sponsors we let me see how I can do it
[02:44:15.140 --> 02:44:17.860]  off the top my head no notes I'm not looking you have to trust me I got my
[02:44:17.860 --> 02:44:23.380]  eyes closed Express VPN yep where it's a great VPN for your phone or computer
[02:44:23.380 --> 02:44:27.140]  Linode where I'm now hosting during fireball where you've been hosting six
[02:44:27.140 --> 02:44:31.540]  colors a great web host with great Linode is the premier hosting for
[02:44:31.540 --> 02:44:37.260]  movable type and also other things also they're hiring if you go to their career
[02:44:37.260 --> 02:44:44.900]  site and last but not least now I'm drawing a blank with a C not with a K
[02:44:44.900 --> 02:44:50.780]  it's with a C nope drawn a blank no I have to get my notes what's my
[02:44:50.780 --> 02:44:54.900]  something something Bank clear Bank oh my god clear Bank where you can go to
[02:44:54.900 --> 02:44:57.820]  raise ten thousand to ten million dollars into 20 minutes with the term
[02:44:57.820 --> 02:45:02.580]  sheet clear Bank I should have known it with the C because it ends with the C
[02:45:02.580 --> 02:45:06.580]  and that's the unusual nature of it well my thanks to them Jason everybody I told
[02:45:06.580 --> 02:45:10.500]  I'm telling right now you want to listen to upgrade 275 because there's really a
[02:45:10.500 --> 02:45:19.100]  lot more in there honestly a lot more on the jack yeah also six colors and you
[02:45:19.100 --> 02:45:24.900]  can spell colors any way you want that pretty much yeah and it's a like daring
[02:45:24.900 --> 02:45:30.580]  fireball hosted by movable type it's software from the last decade almost two
[02:45:30.580 --> 02:45:38.060]  decades ago now but still doing its job doing a great job and everywhere at six
[02:45:38.060 --> 02:45:42.540]  colors you could find Jason's writing elsewhere including his Mac world column
[02:45:42.540 --> 02:45:48.060]  this week we made people angry by telling them they don't want a Mac or
[02:45:48.060 --> 02:45:51.500]  they don't need a Mac yeah they can want it one it's fine just you don't need it
[02:45:51.500 --> 02:45:56.060]  just admit to yourself that you want it more than you need it fun oh man all
[02:45:56.060 --> 02:46:10.020]  right my thanks to you Thank You Jason Thank You John
