[00:00.000 --> 00:03.680]  Rene, welcome back to the talk show.
[00:03.680 --> 00:04.920]  Thanks, always a pleasure.
[00:04.920 --> 00:09.920]  Oh man, how's your summer going?
[00:11.720 --> 00:14.360]  Good, good, I mean, summer is supposed to be
[00:14.360 --> 00:17.240]  where things are slower, but it's been super hectic.
[00:17.240 --> 00:19.080]  Work-wise, you're saying?
[00:19.080 --> 00:21.800]  Work-wise, family-wise, this business,
[00:21.800 --> 00:23.120]  when people come over to visit,
[00:23.120 --> 00:26.480]  and you still have to work, so it's always odd.
[00:26.480 --> 00:28.920]  Right, I totally know what you're talking about.
[00:28.920 --> 00:33.920]  How's the weather up there?
[00:34.320 --> 00:37.320]  It's muggy, so Canada, I don't know if Guy English
[00:37.320 --> 00:40.060]  ever explained this to people, but it goes from like
[00:40.060 --> 00:42.880]  minus 40, which I guess is like minus 30 Fahrenheit,
[00:42.880 --> 00:44.880]  to plus 40, which is like 100 degrees
[00:44.880 --> 00:46.360]  over the course of a couple of weeks,
[00:46.360 --> 00:48.760]  and it's 100% humidity, because Montreal is an island,
[00:48.760 --> 00:50.680]  so we just don't get nice weather.
[00:52.000 --> 00:53.040]  I don't think you do.
[00:54.240 --> 00:57.760]  I don't, I've only been to Montreal during Singleton,
[00:57.760 --> 01:00.480]  and one time, long, long, long, long before that,
[01:00.480 --> 01:01.640]  but I don't remember when it was,
[01:01.640 --> 01:04.260]  but I could tell that even in the winter,
[01:04.260 --> 01:07.580]  you can kind of tell it's high humidity.
[01:07.580 --> 01:09.280]  The equinoxes are nice, that's about it.
[01:09.280 --> 01:13.040]  Yeah, pretty hot here in Philadelphia as well.
[01:16.040 --> 01:17.060]  I don't even know where to start.
[01:17.060 --> 01:18.160]  There's a lot going on.
[01:19.320 --> 01:20.160]  Don't you think?
[01:20.160 --> 01:22.360]  Yeah, it's a sillier season than usual.
[01:22.360 --> 01:25.720]  Yeah, did you see the article?
[01:25.720 --> 01:27.160]  I didn't even want to link to it.
[01:27.160 --> 01:28.760]  Did you see the stupid fucking article
[01:28.760 --> 01:31.760]  in the Wall Street Journal over the weekend?
[01:31.760 --> 01:34.120]  I know Trip Merkle, or whatever the hell his name is,
[01:34.120 --> 01:36.040]  byline was on it, and somebody else,
[01:36.040 --> 01:39.600]  about how Samsung is like the true design company
[01:39.600 --> 01:44.000]  that's built its company for decades around design first.
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.780]  It felt like a sponsored post from Samsung Mobile
[01:46.780 --> 01:48.760]  that was rebranded with an Apple headline
[01:48.760 --> 01:50.140]  so people would click on it.
[01:50.140 --> 01:51.540]  It was a really, really strange article.
[01:51.540 --> 01:52.920]  I know it wasn't, but it was just,
[01:52.920 --> 01:55.000]  it was like a profile piece about Samsung,
[01:55.000 --> 01:57.840]  but shoehorned into, and Apple's losing a clickbait title,
[01:57.840 --> 01:59.800]  and it didn't fit anything.
[01:59.800 --> 02:02.680]  Right, and it's like it wasn't worth,
[02:02.680 --> 02:05.480]  I decided not to even link to it to shoot it down,
[02:05.480 --> 02:08.100]  because it's just, anybody who would go for it,
[02:08.100 --> 02:10.400]  it's just so, it's like,
[02:10.400 --> 02:12.200]  is the Galaxy S8 a good-looking phone?
[02:12.200 --> 02:13.240]  Yes.
[02:13.240 --> 02:17.240]  Is it a head of Apple on the side-to-side bezels
[02:17.240 --> 02:20.040]  and very small chin and forehead?
[02:20.040 --> 02:20.880]  Yes.
[02:20.880 --> 02:25.080]  And, you know, there's no argument about that,
[02:25.080 --> 02:27.080]  and that sort of leads into what we're actually talking
[02:27.080 --> 02:29.640]  about that's substantive about, you know,
[02:29.640 --> 02:31.840]  what might be coming up with the iPhone and stuff.
[02:31.840 --> 02:33.080]  But that's true to an extent,
[02:33.080 --> 02:35.520]  but you look at their, even their recent history,
[02:35.520 --> 02:37.600]  the pen and the Galaxy S6, I guess,
[02:37.600 --> 02:39.040]  because they skipped the seven,
[02:39.040 --> 02:40.480]  got stuck if you put it in backwards,
[02:40.480 --> 02:41.400]  which is not good design.
[02:41.400 --> 02:44.580]  The Galaxy Note 8, or 7, sorry, famously blew up,
[02:44.580 --> 02:47.360]  which is really, really, really bad design.
[02:47.360 --> 02:48.460]  They've had screens come off.
[02:48.460 --> 02:51.440]  They've had, people were making fun of one of their phones
[02:51.440 --> 02:52.460]  because you could stick cards in it
[02:52.460 --> 02:55.280]  because the gap became so big in the side of the screen.
[02:55.280 --> 02:57.160]  These are all, you know, design issues.
[02:57.160 --> 02:59.240]  It's just not how a phone looks.
[02:59.240 --> 03:04.240]  And even with the S8, there are tons of complaints
[03:04.240 --> 03:07.160]  about the Bixby button and, you know,
[03:07.160 --> 03:10.260]  that it's, people are, there's a dedicated button
[03:10.260 --> 03:12.920]  to bring up their version of a voice-driven AI thing
[03:12.920 --> 03:15.660]  called Bixby, dedicated button on the hardware,
[03:15.660 --> 03:19.100]  which in and of itself is a questionable design.
[03:19.100 --> 03:21.680]  Questionable, maybe it's good, I don't think so,
[03:21.680 --> 03:25.020]  but, you know, but it's absolutely,
[03:25.020 --> 03:27.220]  the fact that it seems to get triggered accidentally a lot
[03:27.220 --> 03:28.500]  when you're trying to hit other buttons
[03:28.500 --> 03:30.980]  is probably a design issue.
[03:32.220 --> 03:34.400]  The fingerprint sensor of this thing is on the back
[03:34.400 --> 03:36.460]  because they couldn't put it on the front,
[03:37.460 --> 03:40.120]  which is definitely, in my opinion,
[03:40.120 --> 03:42.780]  I have a Google Pixel and it has a great fingerprint sensor
[03:42.780 --> 03:45.420]  that seems to work about as fast as an iPhone's.
[03:45.420 --> 03:48.420]  Having it on the back is worse than having it on the front.
[03:48.420 --> 03:49.580]  There's no question in my mind.
[03:49.580 --> 03:50.900]  Is it horrible?
[03:50.900 --> 03:53.300]  No, I mean, but it's worse.
[03:53.300 --> 03:54.140]  That's the design.
[03:54.140 --> 03:55.260]  So Samsung's even worse because they put it
[03:55.260 --> 03:56.980]  next to the camera lens, so half the time
[03:56.980 --> 03:59.340]  you swipe the camera lens and then they have to have software
[03:59.340 --> 04:01.180]  to tell you your camera lens is all grossed up
[04:01.180 --> 04:02.300]  and you need to clean it.
[04:02.300 --> 04:04.780]  Right, and yeah, and I think it's actually,
[04:04.780 --> 04:07.580]  while trying to feel your, and it's not even centered,
[04:07.580 --> 04:10.040]  it's like off-center, which is bad design.
[04:10.040 --> 04:15.040]  And famously, you, I have a year's worth of documentation
[04:15.040 --> 04:17.820]  of when you look at the side, at like the bottom
[04:17.820 --> 04:20.300]  where all the ports are and the screws and stuff,
[04:21.660 --> 04:24.180]  noticing how nothing on a Samsung phone
[04:24.180 --> 04:26.020]  is actually center aligned with each other,
[04:26.020 --> 04:29.500]  which is design and which would bother me greatly.
[04:29.500 --> 04:32.280]  And yes, that, it was, like the fact that the speaker grills
[04:32.280 --> 04:36.440]  aren't aligned with the USB slot on a Samsung phone,
[04:36.440 --> 04:38.020]  is that the sort of thing that,
[04:38.020 --> 04:40.300]  of the tens of millions of people who buy one,
[04:40.300 --> 04:42.300]  that most of them aren't going to notice?
[04:42.300 --> 04:46.220]  Yes, but boy, I sure notice it.
[04:46.220 --> 04:47.380]  And it's something Apple builds for,
[04:47.380 --> 04:48.780]  like they specifically build everything
[04:48.780 --> 04:51.380]  from the board on up so that those things do align.
[04:53.020 --> 04:54.780]  Just a question of taking the time to do it.
[04:54.780 --> 04:56.560]  It's not, I don't, I'm sure it's more difficult,
[04:56.560 --> 04:58.560]  but it's something that they could easily do.
[05:03.780 --> 05:05.800]  Anyway, it's, of course it doesn't get
[05:05.800 --> 05:07.000]  into any of that stuff.
[05:07.880 --> 05:09.820]  No, it was, again, it was marketed as news,
[05:09.820 --> 05:11.020]  which was a bad decision if it was,
[05:11.020 --> 05:13.300]  and Neil Seibert had a really good in his,
[05:13.300 --> 05:14.700]  people don't describe to his newsletter,
[05:14.700 --> 05:17.100]  he does a really good job of analyzing the Apple market.
[05:17.100 --> 05:19.820]  He used to be a financial analyst,
[05:19.820 --> 05:21.340]  and I think he was sell side analyst,
[05:21.340 --> 05:22.860]  but he does a really good job of delving
[05:22.860 --> 05:24.540]  into Apple's decisions from sort of the business
[05:24.540 --> 05:25.380]  point of view.
[05:25.380 --> 05:27.940]  And he was saying like just how odd recent Bloomberg
[05:27.940 --> 05:29.420]  and Wall Street Journal pieces have been
[05:29.420 --> 05:30.460]  because they have been focused,
[05:30.460 --> 05:32.740]  they've been marketing opinion as news.
[05:32.740 --> 05:34.540]  And he thinks it's what you've been talking about,
[05:34.540 --> 05:36.040]  which is it's getting harder and harder
[05:36.040 --> 05:37.460]  for them to score rumors.
[05:37.460 --> 05:39.220]  So absent rumors, they'll do anything they can
[05:39.220 --> 05:40.920]  to get the same sort of clicks out of people.
[05:40.920 --> 05:44.020]  Yeah, I actually am a subscriber to Above Avalon,
[05:44.020 --> 05:45.740]  that's Neil Seibert's newsletter,
[05:45.740 --> 05:48.360]  and I read that today, and it actually,
[05:48.360 --> 05:49.760]  the fact that he eviscerated it,
[05:49.760 --> 05:51.980]  so it's a shame, and I don't blame,
[05:53.380 --> 05:55.340]  it's a good business model, and Ben Thompson does it,
[05:55.340 --> 05:59.560]  and others, to have these subscriber-only newsletters
[05:59.560 --> 06:01.220]  with a once a week free post that's everywhere.
[06:01.220 --> 06:03.420]  And it's frustrating for me because if Neil's
[06:03.420 --> 06:05.220]  newsletter today had been public,
[06:05.220 --> 06:06.540]  I definitely would have linked to it,
[06:06.540 --> 06:08.420]  rather than, I don't wanna write it up myself,
[06:08.420 --> 06:12.140]  but yeah, and his main point, and it's a good one,
[06:12.140 --> 06:16.100]  and it's kind of inside baseball for journalism.
[06:17.940 --> 06:21.420]  But like, Daring Fireball is very easily categorized.
[06:21.420 --> 06:24.180]  The entire thing is sort of my opinion column,
[06:24.180 --> 06:27.980]  and everybody knows that I'm writing from my perspective,
[06:27.980 --> 06:31.360]  and I'd make clear by how I phrase my sentences
[06:31.360 --> 06:34.500]  what I'm stating as a fact that I know,
[06:34.500 --> 06:36.300]  or that is just simply what happens
[06:36.300 --> 06:38.020]  when you click this button as a fact,
[06:38.020 --> 06:39.300]  and what's my opinion.
[06:41.100 --> 06:43.120]  And so I can mix them interchangeably,
[06:43.120 --> 06:46.760]  and you know what you're getting if you're a regular reader.
[06:46.760 --> 06:48.780]  In a newspaper, especially a traditional one
[06:48.780 --> 06:50.460]  like the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times,
[06:50.460 --> 06:52.900]  there's a separation between the opinion sections
[06:54.580 --> 06:58.580]  and the news sections, and so somebody like,
[06:58.580 --> 07:03.580]  say, Walt Mossberg wrote, it's not like he wrote
[07:04.140 --> 07:07.180]  on the op-ed page, but his personal technology column,
[07:07.180 --> 07:08.980]  like where Joanna Stern is now,
[07:08.980 --> 07:13.980]  is a subjective column where it's here's this columnist's
[07:14.540 --> 07:17.820]  view on whether this technology's good or bad or whatever.
[07:17.820 --> 07:21.040]  This, the piece about Apple and Samsung design
[07:21.040 --> 07:23.940]  ran in the news section, which, and again,
[07:23.940 --> 07:25.900]  you can have profiles that run there,
[07:25.900 --> 07:28.340]  but it's really hard to justify a lot,
[07:28.340 --> 07:30.440]  most big chunks of that article based on,
[07:32.520 --> 07:35.500]  of it as a news article, because it really, really wasn't.
[07:35.500 --> 07:39.220]  The news of it, and the way that the cheat
[07:39.220 --> 07:42.720]  is the quotes that they, I guess it was two people,
[07:42.720 --> 07:44.980]  Tripp, whatever his name is, and whatever,
[07:44.980 --> 07:48.300]  but the quotes that they picked from quote-unquote analysts
[07:48.300 --> 07:52.680]  and quote former Apple executives and stuff like that,
[07:52.680 --> 07:54.820]  that's the cheat that a news article can use
[07:54.820 --> 07:56.660]  to kind of come across as an opinion column.
[07:56.660 --> 07:59.780]  So the byline article writers aren't giving their opinion,
[07:59.780 --> 08:02.180]  but they're quoting these people who are saying
[08:02.180 --> 08:04.760]  these things that are clearly opinion.
[08:04.760 --> 08:06.540]  And getting quotes from Samsung mobile
[08:06.540 --> 08:08.500]  about the state of Apple design is not something
[08:08.500 --> 08:10.180]  that a legitimate news article would do.
[08:10.180 --> 08:11.020]  Right.
[08:11.940 --> 08:15.580]  And it's, the part about Neil Seibard's article
[08:15.580 --> 08:17.760]  that really made me like, yes, this is exactly
[08:17.760 --> 08:21.900]  what I suspected, but he did the work and went to do it.
[08:21.900 --> 08:23.860]  Here, let me actually just bring it up,
[08:23.860 --> 08:26.840]  because I don't wanna get it wrong.
[08:26.840 --> 08:30.280]  But there was a quote from somebody who was attributed
[08:30.280 --> 08:35.280]  as a, said Hugh Dubberly, a former Apple Creative Director
[08:36.220 --> 08:39.580]  and former member of Samsung's Global Design Advisory Board.
[08:39.580 --> 08:42.020]  The pipeline that Steve Jobs started is over.
[08:42.020 --> 08:44.700]  This is a guy who's saying, here's his full quote.
[08:44.700 --> 08:45.540]  This is a quote from the guy.
[08:45.540 --> 08:47.780]  It's not so much that Samsung has gotten better,
[08:47.780 --> 08:50.180]  but Apple has fundamentally changed, said Hugh Dubberly,
[08:50.180 --> 08:52.740]  a former Apple Creative Director and former member
[08:52.740 --> 08:54.580]  of Samsung's Design Advisory Board.
[08:54.580 --> 08:56.780]  The pipeline that Steve Jobs started is over.
[08:56.780 --> 09:00.740]  That, the gist of it, that pretty much summarizes
[09:00.740 --> 09:02.700]  the gist of the article, which is positing
[09:02.700 --> 09:06.180]  that Samsung has, from its like outset,
[09:06.180 --> 09:08.480]  has been a design-first company,
[09:09.940 --> 09:13.500]  and that Apple is the shell of its former self.
[09:13.500 --> 09:16.860]  It's the, which, it's a stream of opinion
[09:16.860 --> 09:19.480]  that's actually been thankfully fading away recently,
[09:19.480 --> 09:23.220]  which is the Apple is doomed without Steve Jobs.
[09:23.220 --> 09:26.040]  Right, and, but it's, here's a guy going back to it.
[09:26.040 --> 09:28.120]  Now, it's an interesting pedigree,
[09:28.120 --> 09:31.540]  because I'm personally not aware of very many people.
[09:31.540 --> 09:33.400]  In fact, I can't think of anybody off the top of my head
[09:33.400 --> 09:38.260]  who's worked at Apple and Samsung in any, you know,
[09:38.260 --> 09:39.780]  I can't think of any former Apple people
[09:39.780 --> 09:40.980]  who've also worked at Samsung,
[09:40.980 --> 09:42.580]  so that's certainly interesting.
[09:45.380 --> 09:46.220]  But.
[09:46.220 --> 09:47.420]  But in a way, there was a guy who worked at Apple
[09:47.420 --> 09:49.100]  in the UI and then went to work at Blackberry in UI,
[09:49.100 --> 09:50.420]  and it's very similar sort of things,
[09:50.420 --> 09:51.860]  is that they wanna claim the crown,
[09:51.860 --> 09:53.540]  and that's sort of what this does.
[09:53.540 --> 09:55.220]  And they're also from periods, like,
[09:55.220 --> 09:56.180]  I forget when this guy was there,
[09:56.180 --> 09:59.620]  but it was way before any of the modern things
[09:59.620 --> 10:00.980]  that Apple has done before iPhone,
[10:00.980 --> 10:01.940]  before all of these things.
[10:01.940 --> 10:03.460]  And it's like.
[10:03.460 --> 10:05.020]  Here's where Seibart does the work.
[10:05.020 --> 10:06.260]  The author's quote, Hugh Dubberley,
[10:06.260 --> 10:07.660]  a former Apple creative director,
[10:07.660 --> 10:09.500]  and these are Seibart's words.
[10:09.500 --> 10:11.340]  Whenever I see former Apple executive,
[10:11.340 --> 10:13.180]  I raise an eyebrow or two.
[10:13.180 --> 10:14.300]  There seems to be a high correlation
[10:14.300 --> 10:15.500]  between former Apple executives,
[10:15.500 --> 10:16.380]  some kind of negative view
[10:16.380 --> 10:18.080]  as to how Apple is currently operating.
[10:18.080 --> 10:18.920]  Weird, huh?
[10:20.660 --> 10:21.900]  Upon closer examination,
[10:21.900 --> 10:25.500]  Dubberley worked at Apple during the late 1980s and early
[10:25.500 --> 10:27.380]  1990s, that means he joined Apple
[10:27.380 --> 10:30.140]  after Steve left to start NeXT,
[10:30.140 --> 10:35.140]  and he was long gone before Steve returned to Apple in 1996.
[10:35.420 --> 10:36.940]  So it's just sort of what you expect
[10:36.940 --> 10:39.180]  the editor of the Wall Street Journal to do.
[10:39.180 --> 10:42.620]  Right, that's really,
[10:42.620 --> 10:44.520]  it's downright misleading, in my opinion.
[10:44.520 --> 10:46.860]  And it's exactly the sort of thing
[10:46.860 --> 10:49.100]  that I expect better from the Wall Street Journal,
[10:49.100 --> 10:53.680]  where technically speaking, it is technically accurate
[10:53.680 --> 10:56.940]  to describe him as a quote, former Apple executive.
[10:56.940 --> 10:59.040]  Right, that's not incorrect.
[11:00.820 --> 11:03.980]  But as a casual reader of the Wall Street Journal,
[11:03.980 --> 11:07.920]  it leaves you with an incredibly false perception.
[11:07.920 --> 11:10.340]  The perception I would draw from that
[11:10.340 --> 11:14.100]  if I weren't skeptical because of my familiarity
[11:14.100 --> 11:18.900]  with the company and the lack of interchange
[11:18.900 --> 11:21.100]  between employees, especially at an executive level
[11:21.100 --> 11:22.780]  between Apple and Samsung,
[11:22.780 --> 11:25.300]  if I, you know, you and I can be very skeptical of that.
[11:25.300 --> 11:27.120]  Probably most people who are listening to this podcast
[11:27.120 --> 11:28.140]  are at least halfway skeptical.
[11:28.140 --> 11:29.960]  But think about, you know, the Wall Street Journal
[11:29.960 --> 11:31.040]  is a super mass market.
[11:31.040 --> 11:33.180]  It's one of the most read websites and newspapers
[11:33.180 --> 11:34.880]  in America, if not the world.
[11:35.980 --> 11:38.700]  Somebody who's just sort of casually familiar with this
[11:38.700 --> 11:40.840]  would, I would think, would naturally assume
[11:40.840 --> 11:43.560]  that this guy is relevantly,
[11:43.560 --> 11:46.860]  was relevantly employed at both companies, right?
[11:46.860 --> 11:47.700]  I mean.
[11:47.700 --> 11:49.660]  Absolutely.
[11:49.660 --> 11:53.020]  I don't think most people from the Wall Street Journal
[11:53.020 --> 11:55.280]  or reading the Wall Street Journal
[11:55.280 --> 11:58.860]  could name a single product Apple made
[11:58.860 --> 12:02.140]  between the late 80s and early 90s.
[12:02.140 --> 12:04.200]  I don't think they could name a single product.
[12:04.200 --> 12:07.160]  I don't even know if they could name just the Mac,
[12:07.160 --> 12:09.460]  just quote, unquote, the Mac.
[12:09.460 --> 12:10.300]  Maybe.
[12:10.300 --> 12:11.980]  And this, you know, I called it a hit piece
[12:11.980 --> 12:13.600]  and that's, you know, it reels like that.
[12:13.600 --> 12:15.420]  And I remember previously these things
[12:15.420 --> 12:16.260]  sort of go in phases.
[12:16.260 --> 12:18.260]  There's a whole bunch of anti-Apple Pay articles.
[12:18.260 --> 12:19.720]  And I don't believe it was a Wall Street Journal,
[12:19.720 --> 12:21.460]  but it was a similar paper of record,
[12:21.460 --> 12:23.580]  did a story about how terrible, how people,
[12:23.580 --> 12:25.740]  they didn't think that Apple Pay would get any adoption.
[12:25.740 --> 12:27.820]  And the person they quoted was said,
[12:27.820 --> 12:30.180]  like, you know, mobile payment expert, blah, blah, blah.
[12:30.180 --> 12:31.740]  And anyone who was in the industry knew
[12:31.740 --> 12:33.400]  that that was the guy who started the company
[12:33.400 --> 12:35.380]  that Samsung bought to make Samsung Pay.
[12:35.380 --> 12:37.540]  And it wasn't identified at all in the article.
[12:37.540 --> 12:39.040]  So if someone casually reading it would think
[12:39.040 --> 12:40.440]  that an expert had said that this will have
[12:40.440 --> 12:41.740]  never get any traction.
[12:41.740 --> 12:43.020]  Well, it's just inaccurate.
[12:43.020 --> 12:44.020]  They're just looking for hits.
[12:44.020 --> 12:45.620]  And I think the basic gist,
[12:45.620 --> 12:48.580]  I've written about this and Saibart touched upon it.
[12:48.580 --> 12:50.980]  The fact that they know they want to write about Apple
[12:50.980 --> 12:52.680]  and they want to write about this upcoming phone
[12:52.680 --> 12:55.000]  and they know, because it gets clicks,
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.880]  it gets headlines and people are interested in it.
[12:57.880 --> 13:00.700]  And it is a super successful product.
[13:00.700 --> 13:02.700]  You know, financially it makes sense
[13:02.700 --> 13:04.300]  that they would have articles about it.
[13:04.300 --> 13:06.700]  And the truth is most people, everybody,
[13:06.700 --> 13:09.440]  the collectively, we seem to know almost nothing
[13:09.440 --> 13:11.980]  about what's coming up with the new iPhones.
[13:11.980 --> 13:13.440]  Like here's where this article
[13:13.440 --> 13:14.780]  that I didn't really want to write about,
[13:14.780 --> 13:16.980]  but which is exactly what I like having a podcast
[13:16.980 --> 13:18.880]  to talk about, leads into something
[13:18.880 --> 13:20.220]  that really is worth talking about.
[13:20.220 --> 13:21.060]  Absolutely.
[13:21.060 --> 13:24.460]  I'm going to take a break here and thank our first sponsor.
[13:26.460 --> 13:29.180]  Before we get into talking about new iPhones.
[13:29.180 --> 13:31.580]  And our first sponsor, I'm very excited about,
[13:32.860 --> 13:34.460]  it's our good friends at Casper.
[13:35.320 --> 13:38.120]  Casper makes an obsessively engineered mattress
[13:38.120 --> 13:40.500]  at a shockingly fair price.
[13:40.500 --> 13:42.380]  Go to casper.com slash the talk show
[13:42.380 --> 13:44.340]  and use code the talk show.
[13:44.340 --> 13:49.020]  And you will save 50 bucks towards any mattress.
[13:49.020 --> 13:50.500]  Put a little asterisk right there.
[13:50.500 --> 13:51.700]  I'll get back to that.
[13:51.700 --> 13:53.520]  Now Casper created one perfect mattress.
[13:53.520 --> 13:56.260]  This is one of my very favorite things about the company.
[13:56.260 --> 13:58.060]  And they sell it directly to consumers.
[13:58.060 --> 13:59.980]  So when you go to Casper, you don't have to pick
[13:59.980 --> 14:04.220]  like medium firm or extra firm,
[14:04.220 --> 14:07.360]  or you want coil springs, or do you want memory foam,
[14:07.360 --> 14:09.800]  or do you want, how do you know?
[14:09.800 --> 14:12.140]  Especially if you're ordering online, you don't know.
[14:12.140 --> 14:16.180]  No, they have mattress engineers, actual engineers
[14:16.180 --> 14:17.740]  who all they do is design mattresses
[14:17.740 --> 14:21.020]  and they develop one in-house type of mattress.
[14:21.020 --> 14:24.540]  It has a sleek design because it's a foam type thing.
[14:24.540 --> 14:26.860]  It's vacuum packed when it gets delivered to you
[14:26.860 --> 14:28.880]  and it comes in a remarkably small box.
[14:30.020 --> 14:31.060]  I don't know if they still do this,
[14:31.060 --> 14:32.300]  but at one point they were delivering,
[14:32.300 --> 14:35.220]  like in Manhattan, if you ordered in New York,
[14:35.220 --> 14:37.460]  they actually delivered them by bicycle courier.
[14:37.460 --> 14:40.160]  That's how small, I mean, it's a pretty big box
[14:40.160 --> 14:41.940]  for a guy riding a bicycle,
[14:41.940 --> 14:44.620]  but it's actually small enough that a guy could,
[14:44.620 --> 14:47.140]  somebody could put an entire mattress,
[14:47.140 --> 14:49.700]  the way they compress it into a box, onto their back
[14:49.700 --> 14:52.580]  and deliver it to you on a bicycle.
[14:52.580 --> 14:53.500]  It's really, really neat.
[14:53.500 --> 14:55.340]  It's actually fun to open up and use.
[14:56.320 --> 14:57.160]  We've got them here.
[14:57.160 --> 14:58.740]  We use them in the Gruber household.
[14:58.740 --> 15:00.660]  We've just been away on vacation
[15:00.660 --> 15:05.660]  and hotel beds, we stay in nice places
[15:05.660 --> 15:06.580]  and they have nice beds.
[15:06.580 --> 15:09.600]  My son, number one complaint by the end of the vacation
[15:09.600 --> 15:10.520]  was that he wanted to go home
[15:10.520 --> 15:12.140]  and get back on his Casper mattress.
[15:12.140 --> 15:14.320]  Just totally true, absolutely true.
[15:14.320 --> 15:15.700]  He wanted to leave Disney World
[15:15.700 --> 15:18.280]  and go back home to his regular mattress.
[15:19.300 --> 15:21.040]  I don't know how much more of a,
[15:23.460 --> 15:25.940]  I don't know how much more of a compliment I can pay
[15:25.940 --> 15:29.420]  than that a 13-year-old wanted to,
[15:29.420 --> 15:30.740]  was ready to go from Disney World
[15:30.740 --> 15:32.180]  to get home to his Casper mattress.
[15:32.180 --> 15:33.640]  Really, really great stuff.
[15:35.560 --> 15:37.220]  And they're just great prices.
[15:37.220 --> 15:38.380]  I know what you're saying.
[15:38.380 --> 15:40.380]  I know if you've ever heard me do a Casper pitch before,
[15:40.380 --> 15:41.220]  but here's the whole thing.
[15:41.220 --> 15:43.460]  How do you, it seems weird to buy a mattress.
[15:43.460 --> 15:45.980]  It seems weird without ever, ever trying it,
[15:45.980 --> 15:49.140]  even just putting your hand on it, squishing it.
[15:49.140 --> 15:51.020]  Number one, you don't wanna go to a mattress store.
[15:51.020 --> 15:52.380]  Go into a mattress store.
[15:52.380 --> 15:55.140]  Of all the type of brick and mortar stores that suck,
[15:55.140 --> 15:57.200]  mattress stores are way up near the top.
[15:57.200 --> 15:59.360]  Number two, they rip you off.
[15:59.360 --> 16:00.260]  But here's the solution.
[16:00.260 --> 16:03.220]  Casper has a 100-night risk-free guarantee.
[16:03.220 --> 16:06.300]  So you buy it, try it, however skeptical.
[16:06.300 --> 16:08.220]  Maybe you're highly skeptical.
[16:08.220 --> 16:09.060]  Buy it, try it.
[16:09.060 --> 16:11.140]  You get 100 nights, and if you don't like it,
[16:11.140 --> 16:13.340]  you just give them a ring, get on a website,
[16:13.340 --> 16:14.540]  tell them, ah, I don't like it.
[16:14.540 --> 16:16.720]  And they will come, pick it up,
[16:16.720 --> 16:18.300]  and give you all your money back.
[16:18.300 --> 16:20.820]  And Casper mattresses were designed, developed,
[16:20.820 --> 16:23.380]  and they are assembled right here in the USA.
[16:24.400 --> 16:26.180]  So anyway, you get 50 bucks towards any mattress,
[16:26.180 --> 16:28.020]  go to casper.com slash the talk show.
[16:28.020 --> 16:29.100]  Use that code, the talk show.
[16:29.100 --> 16:30.220]  You'll get the money off.
[16:30.220 --> 16:31.100]  The only hitch on that,
[16:31.100 --> 16:32.980]  the asterisk I was telling you about before,
[16:32.980 --> 16:35.420]  is that they also have dog mattresses.
[16:35.420 --> 16:37.260]  I've been selling these things,
[16:37.260 --> 16:39.020]  pitching these things on this sponsor
[16:39.020 --> 16:39.940]  ever since they came out.
[16:39.940 --> 16:42.260]  And I have so many reader emails saying,
[16:42.260 --> 16:44.160]  my God, my dog loves this mattress.
[16:44.160 --> 16:46.700]  My dog won't get up in the morning, loves the mattress.
[16:46.700 --> 16:48.420]  You don't save 50 bucks on a dog mattress
[16:48.420 --> 16:50.620]  because the dog mattresses are cheaper,
[16:50.620 --> 16:52.540]  so they don't have a discount for it.
[16:52.540 --> 16:55.900]  But the affection from your pooch
[16:55.900 --> 16:58.100]  will more than make up for the fact
[16:58.100 --> 16:59.300]  that you don't get the discount on that.
[16:59.300 --> 17:00.140]  So there you go.
[17:00.140 --> 17:01.640]  My thanks to Casper.
[17:01.640 --> 17:03.620]  Great company, great mattress.
[17:03.620 --> 17:06.180]  I really love this product.
[17:06.180 --> 17:08.640]  So that leads us to what we do know about new iPhones.
[17:08.640 --> 17:09.740]  Number one, I think we do.
[17:09.740 --> 17:10.620]  I think it's a fact.
[17:10.620 --> 17:12.220]  And you and I follow this stuff pretty closely.
[17:12.220 --> 17:15.220]  I really do think that while we know some stuff
[17:15.220 --> 17:16.620]  about what seems to be,
[17:16.620 --> 17:19.300]  we have some hunches about what's coming up with new iPhones.
[17:19.300 --> 17:20.740]  I think we know less than we have
[17:20.740 --> 17:23.140]  in just about any year in the past.
[17:23.140 --> 17:23.980]  I think that's true.
[17:23.980 --> 17:26.180]  I mean, we all, it's almost certain.
[17:26.180 --> 17:28.060]  There's no reality in which Apple just pieces out,
[17:28.060 --> 17:30.380]  stops making iPhones and switches to making hot tubs.
[17:30.380 --> 17:32.840]  So I'm fairly certain there will be a new iPhone,
[17:32.840 --> 17:35.380]  but there's just so much up in the air now,
[17:35.380 --> 17:37.100]  especially with,
[17:37.100 --> 17:38.980]  I don't wanna say the iPhone 5C was similar,
[17:38.980 --> 17:41.240]  but that was the last time where there was,
[17:41.240 --> 17:42.380]  for me at least, a curve ball,
[17:42.380 --> 17:43.700]  where there was a consideration
[17:43.700 --> 17:45.460]  that they were gonna make instead of just bringing
[17:45.460 --> 17:48.420]  over the previous year's flagship and dropping it 100 bucks,
[17:48.420 --> 17:50.540]  that they were gonna make something that was less expensive
[17:50.540 --> 17:52.980]  that might better address mainstream markets
[17:52.980 --> 17:54.740]  or emerging markets.
[17:54.740 --> 17:56.420]  And we sort of didn't know what that was gonna be.
[17:56.420 --> 17:57.900]  Some people thought it was gonna be a cheap iPhone.
[17:57.900 --> 17:59.740]  Some people thought it was gonna be something else.
[17:59.740 --> 18:01.620]  And it ended up being the 5C.
[18:01.620 --> 18:04.180]  And this is similar, but at the opposite end of the spectrum
[18:04.180 --> 18:05.820]  where the rumors suggest heavily
[18:05.820 --> 18:07.380]  that they're gonna be looking at the higher markets
[18:07.380 --> 18:08.220]  this time.
[18:08.220 --> 18:10.140]  So there's, the rumors we do know
[18:10.140 --> 18:12.060]  are the ones that have been pretty consistent
[18:12.060 --> 18:13.060]  for a while now.
[18:13.060 --> 18:15.740]  I mean, number one, a long time ago,
[18:15.740 --> 18:18.700]  and I hate to, I really do, I'm laughing here,
[18:18.700 --> 18:20.980]  but I hate to brag, but I really do feel,
[18:20.980 --> 18:25.140]  I really do think I was the first person to mention this,
[18:25.140 --> 18:28.720]  was about two years ago, maybe longer, I don't know.
[18:28.720 --> 18:33.340]  But I heard from a reputable little birdie
[18:33.340 --> 18:37.940]  that Apple was working on a couple years out from then
[18:37.940 --> 18:41.380]  and an iPhone with an edge-to-edge display
[18:41.380 --> 18:43.340]  that got rid of the bezels on the sides
[18:43.340 --> 18:45.180]  and most of them on the top and bottom,
[18:45.180 --> 18:46.860]  and that it's drop dead gorgeous.
[18:46.860 --> 18:48.100]  And I didn't write about it,
[18:48.100 --> 18:50.140]  because I don't like writing about stuff like that anymore,
[18:50.140 --> 18:51.980]  but I talked about it on this show,
[18:51.980 --> 18:54.300]  and it got picked up, I think, by MacRumors.
[18:56.200 --> 18:58.380]  So that's, the idea that there's an iPhone
[18:58.380 --> 19:00.580]  coming with smaller bezels,
[19:00.580 --> 19:03.100]  you don't even need to know anybody or have any sources
[19:03.100 --> 19:05.500]  to see, you know, you don't need a weatherman
[19:05.500 --> 19:07.080]  to know which way the wind blows, right?
[19:07.080 --> 19:09.340]  I mean, it's, you know,
[19:09.340 --> 19:12.380]  iPhones, you know, Apple products tend to get thinner.
[19:12.380 --> 19:13.200]  You know?
[19:13.200 --> 19:15.580]  Well, I think I wrote about the losing the home button,
[19:15.580 --> 19:17.500]  I think, in January of 2015.
[19:17.500 --> 19:19.860]  So this, at least, that should put aside the rumors
[19:19.860 --> 19:20.900]  that this is a last minute thing
[19:20.900 --> 19:22.140]  that they're struggling towards.
[19:22.140 --> 19:22.980]  Right.
[19:28.060 --> 19:30.060]  I think here, what is this?
[19:30.060 --> 19:33.100]  2017 iPhone may feature edge to edge display.
[19:33.100 --> 19:33.940]  Yeah.
[19:33.940 --> 19:35.180]  So this was, it wasn't two years ago,
[19:35.180 --> 19:38.020]  it was me, it was back in May 2016,
[19:38.020 --> 19:39.720]  when I talked about this on the talk show here,
[19:39.720 --> 19:42.320]  I will put this link in the show notes.
[19:42.320 --> 19:44.300]  Actually, I think what I heard about two years prior
[19:44.300 --> 19:46.180]  was the dual camera system, that's right.
[19:46.180 --> 19:48.020]  I get my little birdie stuff.
[19:48.020 --> 19:49.700]  Well, you and I had a discussion,
[19:49.700 --> 19:52.060]  I forget when it was, but it was roughly two years ago,
[19:52.060 --> 19:54.460]  about the practicality of removing the home button,
[19:54.460 --> 19:55.700]  because people were just so used to it
[19:55.700 --> 19:56.980]  as an escape mechanism.
[19:56.980 --> 19:57.820]  Right.
[19:57.820 --> 20:01.300]  And I think you, you know, I think our conclusion
[20:01.300 --> 20:03.100]  was that you just need some other way
[20:03.100 --> 20:04.420]  to have the escape mechanism.
[20:04.420 --> 20:06.300]  It doesn't have to be an actual button,
[20:06.300 --> 20:09.340]  there just needs to be some sort of affordance for that.
[20:09.340 --> 20:11.700]  Yeah, it's the same as the touch ID, face ID thing,
[20:11.700 --> 20:15.380]  is that touch ID is an instance of doing something
[20:15.380 --> 20:17.900]  and there are other ways of doing the same thing.
[20:17.900 --> 20:21.880]  You know, a great example would be mute switches, right?
[20:21.880 --> 20:24.460]  And the iPhone still has one.
[20:24.460 --> 20:26.060]  We could go off on a huge tangent on this,
[20:26.060 --> 20:27.900]  because I've thought about it a lot.
[20:29.860 --> 20:33.300]  Apple, in general, is a company that is generally,
[20:33.300 --> 20:34.460]  I think everybody would agree,
[20:34.460 --> 20:35.800]  whether you like them or dislike them
[20:35.800 --> 20:37.140]  or are ambivalent towards them,
[20:37.140 --> 20:41.260]  they tend to edge towards minimalism on buttons.
[20:41.260 --> 20:44.340]  I mean, they've famously, infamously,
[20:44.340 --> 20:45.980]  that the smart keyboard gets rid of things
[20:45.980 --> 20:49.420]  like the escape key, you know, buttons tend to go away.
[20:49.420 --> 20:51.380]  Apple tends to be conservative on this.
[20:52.820 --> 20:54.760]  And yet, they're the only company that I know of
[20:54.760 --> 20:58.700]  that makes a smartphone that has a dedicated mute switch.
[20:58.700 --> 21:00.780]  So I think Apple obviously thinks the mute switch
[21:00.780 --> 21:01.620]  is an important thing.
[21:01.620 --> 21:03.260]  It's been there on every iPhone ever since.
[21:03.260 --> 21:06.180]  But the iPads started with them,
[21:06.180 --> 21:07.820]  and now, a couple years ago,
[21:07.820 --> 21:10.200]  I think probably more iPads have shipped
[21:10.200 --> 21:13.780]  without mute switches than had them in the first place.
[21:13.780 --> 21:14.620]  But there was-
[21:14.620 --> 21:15.900]  You and I talked about this at WDC,
[21:15.900 --> 21:19.220]  where the rumors for maybe the next or next iPhone
[21:19.220 --> 21:21.300]  is no buttons and no ports,
[21:21.300 --> 21:22.980]  and people thought that was ridiculous,
[21:22.980 --> 21:25.980]  but now, the Pixel 2 is rumored not to have any buttons,
[21:25.980 --> 21:28.620]  and there's rumors of, you know, phones with no ports.
[21:28.620 --> 21:30.020]  So the future keeps going.
[21:30.020 --> 21:31.640]  Right, no headphone port.
[21:31.640 --> 21:32.700]  That's sort of like getting, you know,
[21:32.700 --> 21:34.420]  getting rid of anything hardware, you know,
[21:34.420 --> 21:37.260]  just reducing the thing, ultimately, to-
[21:37.260 --> 21:39.020]  Things that can fail on the device.
[21:39.020 --> 21:42.720]  Right, things that can fail, things that have moving parts.
[21:42.720 --> 21:44.900]  Moving parts tend to go away,
[21:44.900 --> 21:47.480]  and moving parts tend to have problems.
[21:47.480 --> 21:48.320]  Yeah.
[21:48.320 --> 21:49.820]  You know, I have mixed feelings
[21:49.820 --> 21:52.020]  about the missing mute switch on the iPad, personally.
[21:52.020 --> 21:53.520]  I like it,
[21:55.300 --> 21:57.940]  and I like the way that you don't have to turn the thing on
[21:57.940 --> 21:59.500]  or unlock it or do anything on the screen
[21:59.500 --> 22:01.860]  to just shut the thing up if it's making noise.
[22:02.960 --> 22:05.540]  But I understand that that can be less of a, ooh, you know,
[22:05.540 --> 22:07.360]  like, the whole fact that you can have your phone
[22:07.360 --> 22:10.000]  in your pocket and maybe you are the idiot at the movie
[22:10.000 --> 22:12.460]  who forgot to silence your phone,
[22:12.460 --> 22:14.000]  and if it starts making a noise,
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.820]  the fact that you can get that thing silenced
[22:16.820 --> 22:19.040]  so much quicker with that switch than you ever could,
[22:19.040 --> 22:21.780]  no matter what genius invented a software interface
[22:21.780 --> 22:24.420]  for it on the screen, is a big deal.
[22:24.420 --> 22:26.380]  Plus the fact that, like, in that scenario
[22:26.380 --> 22:27.940]  in a movie theater, the fact that you don't have
[22:27.940 --> 22:30.380]  to have the screen light up is an even bigger deal
[22:30.380 --> 22:32.580]  if you're a good human being
[22:32.580 --> 22:35.160]  who does take their phone out during movies.
[22:40.020 --> 22:40.860]  So any-
[22:40.860 --> 22:41.680]  And that was a huge controversy, too.
[22:41.680 --> 22:42.520]  Like, I don't know if you remember,
[22:42.520 --> 22:44.580]  but some people want the mute switch to mute everything,
[22:44.580 --> 22:46.580]  and some people want it only to mute some things
[22:46.580 --> 22:47.980]  and not alarms, for example,
[22:47.980 --> 22:49.300]  and that was hugely controversial at the time.
[22:49.300 --> 22:51.100]  I actually still don't even remember how it works.
[22:51.100 --> 22:52.460]  Like, if I have my phone on mute,
[22:52.460 --> 22:55.380]  my morning alarm clock still makes a sound, right?
[22:55.380 --> 22:56.420]  I think so.
[22:56.420 --> 22:59.580]  Yes, yes, and some phones didn't do that,
[22:59.580 --> 23:01.620]  and then it was a controversy, like, who was doing that right?
[23:01.620 --> 23:03.780]  Right, well, and then you run into that with phones
[23:03.780 --> 23:05.500]  where instead of having a dedicated mute switch,
[23:05.500 --> 23:08.020]  if you just, the idea is you just hold volume down
[23:08.020 --> 23:11.300]  until it gets to zero, well, that's definitely different
[23:11.300 --> 23:14.540]  to me than a mute switch, but anyway, I digress.
[23:14.540 --> 23:16.660]  The idea of an edge-to-edge phone
[23:16.660 --> 23:18.540]  has been floating around for a while,
[23:18.540 --> 23:22.700]  and out of, it seems like,
[23:22.700 --> 23:24.060]  and I've mentioned this all the time,
[23:24.060 --> 23:26.980]  but it seems like a huge source of leaks for Apple,
[23:26.980 --> 23:29.180]  historically, especially for the iPhone,
[23:29.180 --> 23:31.380]  has been the Asian supply chain.
[23:31.380 --> 23:33.260]  There was an interesting thing earlier this summer
[23:33.260 --> 23:37.560]  where it was the outline, got a leaked copy
[23:37.560 --> 23:40.500]  of an internal Apple presentation about how they,
[23:40.500 --> 23:43.100]  a presentation to employees about how they deal with leaks
[23:43.100 --> 23:45.340]  and their policies towards leaks,
[23:45.340 --> 23:47.980]  where internally, Apple claims that they've actually
[23:47.980 --> 23:50.180]  gotten to the point where fewer of the leaks
[23:50.180 --> 23:53.040]  are from the supply chain than from within Apple,
[23:53.040 --> 23:54.920]  which is interesting that Apple would say that,
[23:54.920 --> 23:57.500]  but doesn't really jibe with what I see personally
[23:57.500 --> 23:59.060]  in terms of what gets published.
[24:00.020 --> 24:02.260]  I'm not disputing that that's what Apple thinks internally.
[24:02.260 --> 24:05.260]  I mean, it's, you know, they know what they know.
[24:05.260 --> 24:06.100]  They can think anything they want.
[24:06.100 --> 24:09.540]  Right, well, and they might know things that I don't know.
[24:09.540 --> 24:11.700]  I mean, one thing that they know that's interesting,
[24:11.700 --> 24:13.340]  that's always interesting to me,
[24:13.340 --> 24:15.060]  is they know which ones are bullshit
[24:15.060 --> 24:16.620]  and which ones aren't, right?
[24:16.620 --> 24:18.900]  And so, and some of them are.
[24:18.900 --> 24:20.820]  Like, there's enough stuff,
[24:20.820 --> 24:22.740]  I have enough claim chatter bookmarks
[24:22.740 --> 24:24.820]  that not everything that's been published
[24:24.820 --> 24:25.980]  can possibly be true.
[24:25.980 --> 24:28.500]  There's contradictory reports out there.
[24:30.700 --> 24:33.540]  And the ones that are contradictory often cover themselves.
[24:33.540 --> 24:37.660]  The ones that know that they're on shaky ground.
[24:38.540 --> 24:43.540]  My favorite trick is to say that Apple is still deciding.
[24:43.540 --> 24:47.040]  Yes, that's okay, like a year or so out.
[24:47.040 --> 24:48.120]  It gets less and less believable
[24:48.120 --> 24:50.000]  when it becomes closer to August and September.
[24:50.000 --> 24:53.520]  Right, but one thing that seems very leaky to me,
[24:53.520 --> 24:57.120]  and still is this year, is the display providers,
[24:57.120 --> 24:59.240]  the display suppliers for Apple.
[25:00.600 --> 25:01.800]  And I know they're sharp,
[25:01.800 --> 25:06.800]  and I guess Samsung is the contracted company for OLEDs.
[25:08.440 --> 25:11.320]  And some of the stuff, it's like not even like rumors.
[25:11.320 --> 25:15.720]  I mean, some of the stuff like, it's like in,
[25:15.720 --> 25:16.840]  they may not say it's Apple,
[25:16.840 --> 25:18.840]  but there's like filing, regulatory filings
[25:18.840 --> 25:20.880]  where these companies have said we have a,
[25:20.880 --> 25:23.560]  we're providing 10 million of these displays
[25:23.560 --> 25:26.320]  for a major company for a late.
[25:26.320 --> 25:27.660]  Yeah, and some of them even say Apple,
[25:27.660 --> 25:29.560]  and I wonder if they get a real good phone call after that,
[25:29.560 --> 25:30.600]  like at their earnings statements
[25:30.600 --> 25:31.880]  or at their press conferences in China,
[25:31.880 --> 25:33.800]  they'll say Apple's buying blah, blah, blah,
[25:33.800 --> 25:35.680]  and you just wonder how fast that phone rings.
[25:35.680 --> 25:40.680]  Yeah, I don't know, I do wonder.
[25:45.720 --> 25:48.320]  But it's, and Ming-Chi Kuo,
[25:49.840 --> 25:54.080]  who I think is the top rumor person for Apple,
[25:54.080 --> 25:56.060]  it wears the crown right now,
[25:57.360 --> 26:00.080]  has been on this for a while and has been very consistent
[26:00.080 --> 26:02.900]  that Apple has three new phones coming out this year,
[26:02.900 --> 26:06.540]  a 4.7 inch with an LED display,
[26:06.540 --> 26:09.260]  which would be the same size display and technology
[26:09.260 --> 26:12.200]  and display of the iPhone 7,
[26:12.200 --> 26:14.820]  and also the 6S and the 6,
[26:14.820 --> 26:17.260]  a 5.5 inch LED display,
[26:17.260 --> 26:18.580]  which is the same technology
[26:18.580 --> 26:22.740]  and the same exact diagonal size as the 7 Plus,
[26:22.740 --> 26:25.620]  and also the 6S Plus and the 6 Plus.
[26:25.620 --> 26:29.640]  And here's the weird one, or at least the new one,
[26:29.640 --> 26:33.820]  a 5.8 inch diagonal display
[26:33.820 --> 26:38.820]  that is a different aspect ratio, skinnier and taller,
[26:39.580 --> 26:42.300]  therefore a wider aspect
[26:42.300 --> 26:44.580]  or whichever way you want to hold the phone,
[26:44.580 --> 26:47.220]  if you hold it in portrait,
[26:47.220 --> 26:52.220]  a skinnier, taller display that's an OLED from Samsung
[26:53.160 --> 26:56.020]  that can curve and therefore go edge to edge
[26:56.020 --> 26:59.580]  and has greatly reduced the need for side bezels
[26:59.580 --> 27:00.420]  on the phone.
[27:01.360 --> 27:02.640]  He's been very consistent on that,
[27:02.640 --> 27:05.320]  and it's, you know, would I bet on it?
[27:05.320 --> 27:06.940]  I mean, is it possible that he's wrong?
[27:06.940 --> 27:07.920]  Of course, I think.
[27:07.920 --> 27:10.160]  I never would bet the house on any of these rumors,
[27:10.160 --> 27:12.480]  but it seems pretty good.
[27:13.660 --> 27:15.220]  Yeah, and I think the crux of what you and I
[27:15.220 --> 27:17.060]  were talking about years ago was that,
[27:17.060 --> 27:18.780]  how do you solve the problem of people who want,
[27:18.780 --> 27:20.500]  like we were talking about the iPhone,
[27:20.500 --> 27:22.020]  I guess it was the 6 Plus back then,
[27:22.020 --> 27:24.380]  and it's just too big a phone for some people,
[27:24.380 --> 27:26.320]  and so they go with the 6, or back then,
[27:26.320 --> 27:27.980]  they would stick with a 5S or something,
[27:27.980 --> 27:30.960]  and you can say make a better 5S,
[27:30.960 --> 27:32.040]  but what Apple was thinking is,
[27:32.040 --> 27:34.340]  why can't we make something that's the size of a 6
[27:34.340 --> 27:36.300]  but has a display of a 6S?
[27:36.300 --> 27:38.140]  And that's sort of a different way to solve that problem,
[27:38.140 --> 27:41.420]  and this is the phone that tries to solve that problem.
[27:41.420 --> 27:44.540]  Apparently, you know, it's assumed that it's right.
[27:44.540 --> 27:45.380]  Yeah.
[27:46.300 --> 27:48.100]  I've mentioned this to you
[27:48.100 --> 27:49.300]  before we started recording the show.
[27:49.300 --> 27:53.300]  I don't think that there's a ton of smoke
[27:53.300 --> 27:58.220]  on the two, let's call them the regular new iPhones,
[27:58.220 --> 28:01.060]  the 4.7 and 5.5 inch LEDs.
[28:01.060 --> 28:03.420]  The most obvious thing Apple could do
[28:03.420 --> 28:06.520]  would be to make an iPhone 7S and 7S Plus,
[28:06.520 --> 28:10.160]  because every single time they've come out with a phone
[28:10.160 --> 28:12.920]  with a number, starting with the 3G,
[28:12.920 --> 28:15.460]  then the 4, then the 5, then the 6,
[28:15.460 --> 28:17.640]  the following year, they've come out with a phone
[28:17.640 --> 28:22.180]  with the exact same name, with an S tacked to the end,
[28:22.180 --> 28:27.180]  and with a more or less roughly same form factor,
[28:27.300 --> 28:29.860]  usually case compatible, you know,
[28:29.860 --> 28:33.500]  and if not case compatible, so close to case compatible
[28:33.500 --> 28:36.200]  that you can effectively use,
[28:36.200 --> 28:39.080]  you can use an iPhone 6 case on a 6S,
[28:39.080 --> 28:40.780]  you can use a 6S case on a 6,
[28:40.780 --> 28:43.940]  and everything lines up, the buttons line up, you know.
[28:46.500 --> 28:47.680]  And there have been changes, you know,
[28:47.680 --> 28:51.780]  I think it was the 5S that introduced Touch ID,
[28:51.780 --> 28:53.380]  which is more, you know, you could tell
[28:53.380 --> 28:55.460]  just by looking at it, there you can just eyeball it,
[28:55.460 --> 28:56.360]  you don't have to turn it on,
[28:56.360 --> 28:58.860]  you don't have to run like a benchmark or something
[28:58.860 --> 29:00.720]  to tell that it was new,
[29:02.000 --> 29:04.780]  but the Touch ID sensor was where the old home button was,
[29:04.780 --> 29:07.180]  so it didn't really interfere with any kind of case design
[29:07.180 --> 29:08.420]  or something like that.
[29:08.420 --> 29:10.620]  And this, the 4S had the better antenna,
[29:10.620 --> 29:13.820]  with the extra piece of plastic in it, yeah.
[29:13.820 --> 29:16.660]  Right, it had the, it's actually,
[29:16.660 --> 29:19.340]  it's like one of my favorite eras of iPhone design,
[29:19.340 --> 29:22.020]  because there was the weird, there was the weird Verizon
[29:22.020 --> 29:27.020]  iPhone in between, which had the futuristic antenna design.
[29:28.780 --> 29:29.880]  Yeah, I think it had the dual antenna
[29:29.880 --> 29:31.220]  that could switch intelligently depending
[29:31.220 --> 29:33.660]  if your hand was blocking too much of it to get a signal.
[29:33.660 --> 29:36.500]  Right, and those black lines that separated
[29:36.500 --> 29:38.300]  the pieces of the side frame,
[29:39.300 --> 29:43.140]  the Verizon iPhone 4 had the black lines
[29:43.140 --> 29:44.380]  that separated the components
[29:44.380 --> 29:48.140]  that matched with the next year's 4S.
[29:48.140 --> 29:50.060]  Yes. You know, so there was a weird,
[29:50.060 --> 29:53.260]  it was sort of like the iPhone 4 and a half, really.
[29:53.260 --> 29:54.820]  Yeah, it really was.
[29:54.820 --> 29:56.540]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[29:56.540 --> 29:59.340]  Well, I had to get the CDMA antenna in there,
[29:59.340 --> 30:00.620]  and that was the best way to do it.
[30:00.620 --> 30:03.140]  Right, the Verizon iPhone 4 is one of my all-time,
[30:03.140 --> 30:05.420]  probably like my, maybe my second
[30:05.420 --> 30:07.020]  or third favorite iPhone of all time.
[30:07.020 --> 30:07.860]  Yeah.
[30:07.860 --> 30:10.020]  Because I liked the, had the better antenna,
[30:10.020 --> 30:11.860]  and the other little thing that it had,
[30:11.860 --> 30:14.360]  that no iPhone had until recently,
[30:14.360 --> 30:19.300]  was it didn't have those regulatory body logos
[30:19.300 --> 30:20.500]  inscribed on the back.
[30:20.500 --> 30:22.580]  Because they didn't need to sell it worldwide,
[30:22.580 --> 30:24.100]  they were only gonna sell it in the U.S.,
[30:24.100 --> 30:25.900]  and so they didn't have to put
[30:25.900 --> 30:27.700]  all those stupid logos on the back.
[30:27.700 --> 30:30.100]  Yeah, it was beautiful.
[30:30.100 --> 30:31.300]  Yeah, I really liked it.
[30:33.280 --> 30:35.140]  So anyway, the most obvious thing Apple
[30:35.140 --> 30:37.060]  could be planning for this year
[30:37.060 --> 30:39.980]  would be to do an iPhone 7S,
[30:39.980 --> 30:44.980]  assuming that there is new 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch phones,
[30:45.060 --> 30:46.380]  and they're not just going to keep selling
[30:46.380 --> 30:50.260]  the 7 and the 7 Plus, and introduce one new phone,
[30:50.260 --> 30:52.780]  the iPhone 8, or whatever you wanna call it.
[30:52.780 --> 30:54.180]  That's what Apple has done for years,
[30:54.180 --> 30:56.780]  is they've made one new phone per year.
[30:58.260 --> 30:59.900]  Or at least that's the narrative.
[30:59.900 --> 31:01.820]  I think that with the Plus phones,
[31:01.820 --> 31:04.180]  that that's, that they've already started,
[31:04.180 --> 31:07.040]  it's like a slow-breaking, I could.
[31:07.040 --> 31:08.040]  Yeah.
[31:08.040 --> 31:11.460]  It's like that big landmass breaking off Antarctica.
[31:11.460 --> 31:13.260]  It takes a while, but you can sort of see
[31:13.260 --> 31:15.260]  the cracks coming for a while, and then all of a sudden.
[31:15.260 --> 31:17.060]  We go from Pangea to a bunch of continents.
[31:17.060 --> 31:20.300]  Yeah, and all of a sudden, it's, wow,
[31:20.300 --> 31:21.540]  it's a different strategy.
[31:21.540 --> 31:22.540]  So if they did that, though,
[31:22.540 --> 31:24.940]  if they went with 7S and 7S Plus,
[31:24.940 --> 31:27.380]  it's usually, they introduce a new color,
[31:27.380 --> 31:29.300]  and then they do one special feature.
[31:29.300 --> 31:31.700]  So it could be, it will have an A11 chip,
[31:31.700 --> 31:33.840]  and it'll have inductive charging or something,
[31:33.840 --> 31:35.460]  and that would be the positioning for it.
[31:35.460 --> 31:36.300]  Right.
[31:36.300 --> 31:39.060]  But the general rules, and again,
[31:39.060 --> 31:40.260]  Apple can do whatever it wants.
[31:40.260 --> 31:41.660]  These are just names, right?
[31:41.660 --> 31:45.060]  I mean, Apple could make the thing a perfect square,
[31:45.060 --> 31:48.540]  like an old Polaroid, and still call it the iPhone 7S.
[31:48.540 --> 31:50.860]  Triangle-shaped, and call it the Galactica phone.
[31:50.860 --> 31:53.220]  No, and they can still call it the iPhone 7S, right?
[31:53.220 --> 31:56.260]  You know, that they could make it totally different,
[31:56.260 --> 31:57.740]  make it a circle, make it a triangle,
[31:57.740 --> 31:59.260]  and still call it the iPhone 7S,
[31:59.260 --> 32:04.260]  and we'd have to worry about the mental health
[32:04.260 --> 32:08.320]  of Phil Schiller, but they could do it, right?
[32:08.320 --> 32:09.780]  Yeah, they just go and enter a name in the machine,
[32:09.780 --> 32:11.020]  and it gets printed on boxes.
[32:11.020 --> 32:12.220]  It's not easy for them.
[32:13.860 --> 32:15.740]  I have no idea.
[32:15.740 --> 32:18.340]  I have no, you know, I heard things for a while.
[32:18.340 --> 32:21.560]  I haven't heard anything in a long time
[32:21.560 --> 32:23.460]  about anything related to new iPhones.
[32:23.460 --> 32:25.380]  So I have no inside sources,
[32:25.380 --> 32:27.540]  no secret birdies on any of this stuff.
[32:27.540 --> 32:29.860]  All I know is what I read on the rumor reports,
[32:29.860 --> 32:34.860]  and I also know what makes sense.
[32:35.920 --> 32:38.780]  I kind of hope that that's not what they're doing.
[32:38.780 --> 32:41.820]  I kind of hope that, assuming it's true,
[32:41.820 --> 32:44.640]  this is all based on the assumption that Ming-Chi Kuo
[32:44.640 --> 32:46.020]  knows exactly what he's talking about,
[32:46.020 --> 32:49.160]  and that there is a new phone, some kind of new hardware,
[32:49.160 --> 32:50.920]  4.7-inch, 5.5-inch.
[32:52.420 --> 32:55.980]  I hope that those are the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus,
[32:55.980 --> 32:58.260]  and maybe they get new names, too.
[32:58.260 --> 33:01.100]  Maybe they just drop numbers completely,
[33:01.100 --> 33:05.260]  but that they have physical changes that make them,
[33:05.260 --> 33:07.940]  if not radically different, significantly different.
[33:07.940 --> 33:10.880]  Like, for example, if all three phones
[33:10.880 --> 33:12.840]  have dual-camera designs.
[33:12.840 --> 33:17.660]  Like, that would totally render iPhone 7 cases inadequate
[33:17.660 --> 33:21.280]  for this new phone, even though it's a same-sized display,
[33:21.280 --> 33:24.700]  because there wouldn't be room for the second camera lens.
[33:24.700 --> 33:27.580]  And that fits sort of what they ended up doing for the iPad
[33:27.580 --> 33:30.060]  is that they went to iPad Mini, iPad,
[33:30.060 --> 33:31.540]  and then iPad Pro for a while,
[33:31.540 --> 33:34.960]  and you had the existing designs, two sizes,
[33:34.960 --> 33:37.260]  almost identical, because the Air 2 and the Mini 4,
[33:37.260 --> 33:39.060]  I think, were identical except for size.
[33:39.060 --> 33:41.060]  And then the Pro got introduced on top of that,
[33:41.060 --> 33:43.880]  and I could see something where they have those two iPhones.
[33:43.880 --> 33:46.260]  It's the iPhone, iPhone Plus, and then iPhone Pro,
[33:46.260 --> 33:47.220]  if that's what you really want.
[33:47.220 --> 33:49.100]  Right, I could totally see them going with that,
[33:49.100 --> 33:50.760]  and we can talk about naming separately,
[33:50.760 --> 33:52.900]  but I could, just as an example,
[33:52.900 --> 33:56.280]  I could totally see the names iPhone, iPhone Plus,
[33:56.280 --> 33:58.980]  and iPhone Pro as the three names of the product,
[33:58.980 --> 34:01.200]  and that next year, they just have the new iPhone,
[34:01.200 --> 34:04.680]  new iPhone Plus, new iPhone Pro until, you know, whatever.
[34:07.620 --> 34:09.620]  But that would, that would,
[34:09.620 --> 34:11.660]  I just don't, I don't feel like anybody knows.
[34:11.660 --> 34:13.200]  I really, I really don't.
[34:14.100 --> 34:16.420]  And we get so much, there's so much angst about all of this.
[34:16.420 --> 34:18.620]  Like, one of my favorite lines from you has always been,
[34:18.620 --> 34:19.940]  everyone drinks the same Coke,
[34:19.940 --> 34:21.420]  whether you're the janitor or the president,
[34:21.420 --> 34:22.620]  you drink the same Coke.
[34:22.620 --> 34:24.820]  And this year, even though Apple has not announced anything,
[34:24.820 --> 34:26.940]  the mere speculation that there'll be an iPhone
[34:26.940 --> 34:30.380]  that is, in some ways, subjectively, objectively better
[34:30.380 --> 34:33.260]  than previous iPhones has created an incredible
[34:33.260 --> 34:35.860]  sense of offense amongst some people in the community.
[34:35.860 --> 34:38.040]  Like, how could Apple make an iPhone that's, you know,
[34:38.040 --> 34:39.420]  more expensive, that's more premium,
[34:39.420 --> 34:42.500]  that if I buy an iPhone, it's not the best iPhone?
[34:42.500 --> 34:45.100]  Yeah, that's what they didn't get with the iPad Pro.
[34:48.700 --> 34:51.260]  Wait, wait, say that again.
[34:51.260 --> 34:52.420]  They didn't get that sentiment with the iPad,
[34:52.420 --> 34:53.420]  when they introduced iPad Pro,
[34:53.420 --> 34:55.060]  that didn't seem to be a huge sentiment in the community,
[34:55.060 --> 34:56.940]  but how dare they make a better iPad?
[34:56.940 --> 34:58.860]  Yeah, I don't think people are as emotional about iPads
[34:58.860 --> 35:00.260]  as they are iPhones.
[35:00.260 --> 35:03.500]  And the iPad has sort of,
[35:05.740 --> 35:08.140]  but long ago, bifurcated into,
[35:08.140 --> 35:11.420]  it's not quite obvious what the best iPad was.
[35:11.420 --> 35:13.780]  Like, I think that there was a case when they first came out
[35:13.780 --> 35:16.580]  with the iPad Mini that the iPad Mini, I liked it.
[35:16.580 --> 35:18.220]  I thought it was the best iPad,
[35:18.220 --> 35:21.780]  even though it was like a year behind on the,
[35:21.780 --> 35:23.720]  it was like, let's take last, you know,
[35:23.720 --> 35:25.280]  for a couple of years, what they were doing was,
[35:25.280 --> 35:28.300]  let's take last year's 9.7-inch iPad,
[35:28.300 --> 35:30.500]  put that system in a chip and components
[35:30.500 --> 35:33.180]  into the smaller case and sell it at a lower price.
[35:33.180 --> 35:34.940]  Didn't even have a retina display when it debuted.
[35:34.940 --> 35:37.820]  Right, and I thought, you know,
[35:37.820 --> 35:39.780]  it really was, it's just the case,
[35:39.780 --> 35:41.020]  I've mentioned this before,
[35:41.020 --> 35:42.900]  but it's just me hitting my 40s
[35:42.900 --> 35:45.740]  and my eyesight deteriorating.
[35:45.740 --> 35:47.740]  You know, the fact that the iPad Mini screen
[35:47.740 --> 35:50.320]  was just pixel for pixel, exactly the bigger iPad screen,
[35:50.320 --> 35:52.380]  so everything was just shrunk, you know,
[35:52.380 --> 35:54.260]  pixel for pixel, exactly the same.
[35:54.260 --> 35:55.660]  Like, your software didn't have to,
[35:55.660 --> 35:57.500]  developers didn't have to do a damn thing
[35:57.500 --> 35:59.160]  to support the iPad Mini.
[35:59.160 --> 36:03.540]  Even if your layout was completely based on the assumption
[36:03.540 --> 36:06.300]  of the pixels of the screen being exactly the same,
[36:06.300 --> 36:08.620]  it literally was because it was just the same number
[36:08.620 --> 36:12.560]  of pixels and they were just two-thirds smaller, roughly.
[36:14.180 --> 36:16.340]  I liked it better, at least when my eyesight was smaller.
[36:16.340 --> 36:18.420]  And my son, who's still very young and still has,
[36:18.420 --> 36:20.700]  he much prefers the Mini iPad size.
[36:21.980 --> 36:24.900]  So I think that the iPad line sort of split
[36:24.900 --> 36:27.660]  where it wasn't quite clear what was best.
[36:27.660 --> 36:32.660]  Whereas the basic gist of the iPhone has been for years,
[36:34.220 --> 36:37.420]  you know, one new model per year at the high end.
[36:37.420 --> 36:38.820]  You know, like even with the 5C,
[36:38.820 --> 36:39.660]  which you mentioned before,
[36:39.660 --> 36:41.980]  which was clearly a strategic exception,
[36:41.980 --> 36:45.580]  sort of dipping their toes in an experiment that,
[36:45.580 --> 36:47.540]  I don't think it was the failure that people call it,
[36:47.540 --> 36:51.220]  but it clearly wasn't as big a hit as they had perhaps hoped.
[36:51.220 --> 36:52.260]  And I like that they do that.
[36:52.260 --> 36:54.300]  Like one of the things that scares me is that when,
[36:54.300 --> 36:55.740]  we get this, we had two sentiments.
[36:55.740 --> 36:58.260]  We get that Apple is boring and that Apple changes too much.
[36:58.260 --> 37:00.700]  And they're both, they're sort of two truths.
[37:00.700 --> 37:02.540]  And people believe both of them at the same time.
[37:02.540 --> 37:03.980]  And I think it's just human nature.
[37:03.980 --> 37:05.500]  But if Apple doesn't take risks,
[37:05.500 --> 37:06.940]  then Apple is losing a sense of innovation.
[37:06.940 --> 37:08.060]  They're nothing since Steve Jobs.
[37:08.060 --> 37:08.940]  They're boring.
[37:08.940 --> 37:11.040]  You know, everyone else is running circles around them.
[37:11.040 --> 37:13.260]  But when they do, when they try something like iPhone 5C,
[37:13.260 --> 37:16.100]  or if they do this iPhone X, iPhone 8 thing,
[37:16.100 --> 37:17.540]  then how can Apple do this?
[37:17.540 --> 37:19.460]  They're betraying us as customers.
[37:19.460 --> 37:21.180]  Why are they, it's a huge risk.
[37:21.180 --> 37:23.580]  How can they, it's, they can't win either way.
[37:23.580 --> 37:25.280]  And I don't think the goal is for them to win.
[37:25.280 --> 37:26.820]  But I think as a company, to be Apple,
[37:26.820 --> 37:29.020]  they have to keep trying these risky things.
[37:31.100 --> 37:32.280]  Yeah, I agree too.
[37:32.280 --> 37:36.640]  And I've, from talking to people at Apple,
[37:37.980 --> 37:40.100]  in product briefings and stuff like that,
[37:40.100 --> 37:41.920]  I mean, it's very, I mean, again,
[37:41.920 --> 37:43.520]  you never know what's bullshit and what's not.
[37:43.520 --> 37:47.680]  But I really do believe it, that they, you know,
[37:47.680 --> 37:52.020]  they don't have any kind of magic science behind the scenes
[37:52.020 --> 37:53.580]  that predicts demand.
[37:53.580 --> 37:55.580]  They don't, there is no, I think there's a lot of people
[37:55.580 --> 37:58.720]  who assume that Apple is so effective and so smart,
[37:58.720 --> 38:01.060]  and that they've, you know, that there's some kind
[38:01.060 --> 38:04.180]  of spreadsheet on Tim Cook's, you know,
[38:04.180 --> 38:05.060]  I was gonna say MacBook,
[38:05.060 --> 38:07.860]  but let's just say Tim Cook's iPad Pro even,
[38:07.860 --> 38:12.060]  that he can, you know, you know, hit a button,
[38:12.060 --> 38:15.620]  and it tells them exactly how many of each phone to make,
[38:15.620 --> 38:17.100]  and which design is gonna sell,
[38:17.100 --> 38:18.980]  and what quantities in which country.
[38:18.980 --> 38:20.300]  And none of that's true.
[38:20.300 --> 38:22.200]  And that they, you know, one of the most surprising things
[38:22.200 --> 38:23.580]  from Apple's perspective every year
[38:23.580 --> 38:25.700]  is how things change from country to country,
[38:25.700 --> 38:29.540]  and like, how the 5C sold in the United States
[38:29.540 --> 38:31.540]  versus in Germany and stuff like that.
[38:31.540 --> 38:33.180]  And there's like, who would have known that something,
[38:33.180 --> 38:34.300]  I don't even know if that's true,
[38:34.300 --> 38:36.300]  maybe it's the other way around, but that, you know,
[38:36.300 --> 38:39.260]  that in Germany, the 5C was surprisingly popular,
[38:39.260 --> 38:40.620]  and they had no idea of that,
[38:40.620 --> 38:44.260]  and they had to, you know, redirect all these shipments
[38:44.260 --> 38:46.960]  that were originally meant for the U.S. from there,
[38:46.960 --> 38:49.600]  and instead go the other way on the, go over to Germany,
[38:49.600 --> 38:51.120]  because that's where people are buying them.
[38:51.120 --> 38:52.180]  They don't know.
[38:52.180 --> 38:53.100]  And you see it, you see it.
[38:53.100 --> 38:56.900]  I was gonna say Steve Jobs was a really good
[38:56.900 --> 38:58.200]  taste predictor too, but he didn't,
[38:58.200 --> 38:59.860]  not everything he did was a huge success.
[38:59.860 --> 39:02.140]  It's just the things that were, were so successful,
[39:02.140 --> 39:03.620]  they obliterated almost any memory
[39:03.620 --> 39:05.140]  of the things that didn't do as well.
[39:05.140 --> 39:08.220]  Right, and even so, I mean, you know,
[39:08.220 --> 39:13.220]  people often, people often look back at the Mac G4 Cube,
[39:14.060 --> 39:16.460]  and the thing that they, the first thing that comes to mind
[39:16.460 --> 39:18.800]  is that it was susceptible to cracks,
[39:18.800 --> 39:20.960]  and if, but that could have been fixed.
[39:20.960 --> 39:23.500]  Like, if it had sold in well, in good enough quantities,
[39:23.500 --> 39:26.100]  that, they could have just fixed whatever it was
[39:26.100 --> 39:28.520]  that was causing the plastic to crack.
[39:28.520 --> 39:31.740]  The problem with the Mac Cube was that in the market,
[39:31.740 --> 39:33.940]  people didn't see enough value to pay a premium
[39:33.940 --> 39:36.420]  for a small box that was beautiful on your desk.
[39:36.420 --> 39:41.420]  People instead would pay less for a less elegant iMac,
[39:43.780 --> 39:45.140]  you know, a big, you know, which at the time
[39:45.140 --> 39:49.500]  was a big CRT, I think, or pay the same amount
[39:49.500 --> 39:52.780]  and get a Mac Pro that had way more performance
[39:52.780 --> 39:53.620]  than the Mac Cube.
[39:53.620 --> 39:56.700]  Nobody wanted to pay the premium just for the small box, and.
[39:56.700 --> 40:00.720]  And they went to be, there was the iPod Fatty Nano,
[40:00.720 --> 40:03.220]  and there was the iPod Shuffle with no buttons on it,
[40:03.220 --> 40:04.060]  you know, that they all walked,
[40:04.060 --> 40:06.080]  that they both walked back very quickly.
[40:06.080 --> 40:08.780]  Yeah, yeah, you know, they, you know, they,
[40:08.780 --> 40:11.820]  yeah, the Fat Nano, Fat Nano.
[40:11.820 --> 40:14.820]  Fat Nano was one of the most curious ones.
[40:14.820 --> 40:16.500]  Someday I would love to get the story on that
[40:16.500 --> 40:18.580]  because I have to say, right from when I first saw it,
[40:18.580 --> 40:20.140]  I was like, well, I don't like that anywhere near
[40:20.140 --> 40:21.620]  as much as last year's.
[40:21.620 --> 40:22.460]  Yep.
[40:22.460 --> 40:23.380]  And there were no features on it
[40:23.380 --> 40:24.420]  that were compelling either.
[40:24.420 --> 40:26.160]  It wasn't like, well, I don't like the way it looks,
[40:26.160 --> 40:28.500]  but it has blank that the other one didn't have.
[40:28.500 --> 40:31.300]  It just was the exact same thing, but in a.
[40:31.300 --> 40:34.080]  It was a portrait device with a landscape video
[40:34.080 --> 40:36.200]  that was pretty weird, yeah.
[40:37.860 --> 40:39.140]  But my point is that those things happened
[40:39.140 --> 40:40.200]  and Apple took those risks,
[40:40.200 --> 40:41.800]  and once in a while they had much bigger hits,
[40:41.800 --> 40:44.660]  but I think it's almost like that criticism of Pixar,
[40:44.660 --> 40:46.780]  you know, like, not everyone is gonna be a huge hit,
[40:46.780 --> 40:48.440]  but they have to try, they have to swing.
[40:48.440 --> 40:50.980]  Yeah, and though it's also the case,
[40:50.980 --> 40:53.220]  it is a similar, it's a decent analogy to Pixar
[40:53.220 --> 40:55.820]  in so far as that they can,
[40:55.820 --> 40:58.100]  they have to take chances sometimes,
[40:59.100 --> 41:02.060]  but they do have to be very careful about those chances
[41:02.060 --> 41:04.100]  because they can't really afford a complete dud,
[41:04.100 --> 41:06.740]  and the iPhone is certainly that case.
[41:06.740 --> 41:07.580]  Yeah.
[41:08.820 --> 41:10.380]  It's worth going back to that Warhol thing,
[41:10.380 --> 41:12.420]  because I've quoted it, and people, you know,
[41:12.420 --> 41:15.020]  I wrote a piece about two weeks ago,
[41:16.380 --> 41:19.300]  basic gist of it, making the case of
[41:19.300 --> 41:22.460]  I don't think people are thinking through this,
[41:22.460 --> 41:24.480]  the rumors of these three new phones,
[41:24.480 --> 41:26.820]  which I covered a couple minutes ago.
[41:26.820 --> 41:27.940]  People aren't thinking this through.
[41:27.940 --> 41:30.460]  If those rumors are true,
[41:30.460 --> 41:32.140]  I think that people's assumptions
[41:32.140 --> 41:34.340]  about how these new iPhones are gonna be priced
[41:34.340 --> 41:37.940]  and how they're gonna be available are way wrong
[41:37.940 --> 41:39.780]  in so far as that what it seemed,
[41:39.780 --> 41:42.160]  and the reaction to my article made clear
[41:42.160 --> 41:43.780]  that this is what people were thinking,
[41:43.780 --> 41:46.040]  is that they were thinking that the fancy new iPhone
[41:46.040 --> 41:50.420]  with the OLED display, I've been calling it the iPhone Pro,
[41:50.420 --> 41:53.220]  people have been calling it iPhone X, iPhone edition,
[41:53.220 --> 41:54.580]  whatever you wanna call it,
[41:55.600 --> 41:59.520]  that it's going to be the new iPhone for the year,
[41:59.520 --> 42:01.420]  just like in previous years,
[42:01.420 --> 42:04.660]  and it will come in at around the same prices
[42:04.660 --> 42:06.820]  as the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus,
[42:06.820 --> 42:10.400]  meaning like a 650, 700-ish starting point
[42:10.400 --> 42:12.600]  for the lowest end configuration,
[42:12.600 --> 42:14.860]  which is really just about storage space
[42:14.860 --> 42:17.900]  and a high-end storage, you know, high-end option up to,
[42:17.900 --> 42:20.740]  right now, I think that the 7 Plus sells for 969,
[42:20.740 --> 42:23.100]  so maybe, you know, somewhere, but under 1,000.
[42:25.100 --> 42:27.580]  And the gist of my argument is if you look at the rumors,
[42:27.580 --> 42:29.900]  especially that there's going to be, quote, new
[42:29.900 --> 42:33.300]  4.7 and 5.5-inch phones, and some of the rumors include
[42:33.300 --> 42:34.860]  that they're gonna get more than just,
[42:34.860 --> 42:36.240]  it's not just like the,
[42:37.140 --> 42:40.820]  not just like the Series 1 Apple Watch,
[42:40.820 --> 42:42.420]  where it's a very, you know,
[42:42.420 --> 42:45.320]  pretty much like the Series, the original Apple Watch,
[42:45.320 --> 42:46.620]  but just with one, you know,
[42:46.620 --> 42:49.580]  just with the new system on a chip,
[42:49.580 --> 42:51.640]  but otherwise almost indistinguishable.
[42:53.260 --> 42:54.820]  I don't think it's gonna be like that at all,
[42:54.820 --> 42:56.300]  and if it is, then that would mean
[42:56.300 --> 42:58.840]  that these new 4.7 and 5.5-inch phones
[42:58.840 --> 43:00.660]  would probably come in at the same prices
[43:00.660 --> 43:02.940]  as the 7 and 7 Plus today,
[43:02.940 --> 43:06.620]  and therefore, the new OLED phone
[43:06.620 --> 43:08.900]  would have to have a higher price.
[43:08.900 --> 43:10.420]  And combine that with the fact
[43:10.420 --> 43:11.660]  that all these rumor mill things
[43:11.660 --> 43:14.060]  coming from the supply chain are saying
[43:14.060 --> 43:16.700]  that this thing is gonna be supply constrained,
[43:16.700 --> 43:20.220]  might not even ship, period, until surprisingly late
[43:20.220 --> 43:23.460]  in the iPhone cycle, like November or even December,
[43:23.460 --> 43:25.500]  they're saying that it may not even, you know,
[43:25.500 --> 43:28.300]  consumers may not get one in their hands until December.
[43:29.820 --> 43:32.360]  Again, if that's the case, it has to have,
[43:32.360 --> 43:33.200]  well, it doesn't have to.
[43:33.200 --> 43:36.720]  I mean, obviously, Apple could just eat money, you know,
[43:36.720 --> 43:38.860]  and leave money on the table.
[43:38.860 --> 43:41.740]  But the rules of supply and demand
[43:41.740 --> 43:44.460]  would suggest that it should have a higher price,
[43:44.460 --> 43:47.380]  and I say should not, again, not in a moral sense,
[43:47.380 --> 43:49.420]  but according to the rules of supply and demand,
[43:49.420 --> 43:50.260]  where if there's a product-
[43:50.260 --> 43:51.460]  They could do like AirPods,
[43:51.460 --> 43:53.300]  where they sell them close to what they can,
[43:53.300 --> 43:55.100]  and then they're continually out of stock,
[43:55.100 --> 43:57.180]  or they could price them so that it sort of balances
[43:57.180 --> 43:58.580]  and normalizes out the supply.
[43:58.580 --> 44:01.140]  Right, and AirPods are worth going back to as an example.
[44:01.140 --> 44:03.660]  I think, for example, if Apple wanted to right now,
[44:03.660 --> 44:06.140]  or at least, and if they had any idea
[44:06.140 --> 44:09.660]  of how tightly constrained they were going to be all along,
[44:09.660 --> 44:13.660]  they could have sold AirPods for at least double the price,
[44:13.660 --> 44:15.460]  or almost double, let's say 299,
[44:15.460 --> 44:16.820]  which is a little less than double,
[44:16.820 --> 44:18.140]  because they sell for 159.
[44:18.140 --> 44:20.380]  But if AirPods sold for 299,
[44:20.380 --> 44:22.540]  I think that they would still be supply constrained
[44:22.540 --> 44:23.380]  right now.
[44:23.380 --> 44:25.700]  There'd be enough people buying them for 299
[44:25.700 --> 44:27.000]  that the people who do buy them
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.320]  would say enough rave things about them.
[44:30.540 --> 44:32.660]  I mean, I would still rave about them.
[44:32.660 --> 44:34.540]  I would still be happy if I had purchased them.
[44:34.540 --> 44:36.300]  I would obviously, at 299,
[44:36.300 --> 44:39.300]  would be a little bit more conservative
[44:39.300 --> 44:40.980]  about recommending them,
[44:40.980 --> 44:43.620]  and obviously people would have double the anxiety
[44:43.620 --> 44:45.980]  about losing them, et cetera,
[44:45.980 --> 44:47.700]  but I still think that they'd be sold out,
[44:47.700 --> 44:50.220]  because clearly there's not enough of them.
[44:50.220 --> 44:51.640]  And I don't think the people who do buy them
[44:51.640 --> 44:53.660]  are particularly price sensitive at that point.
[44:53.660 --> 44:55.160]  They want the new technology now.
[44:55.160 --> 44:56.640]  Right, I think that they set the price,
[44:56.640 --> 44:57.860]  because that's the other thing,
[44:57.860 --> 44:59.540]  is that Apple does see prices
[44:59.540 --> 45:02.940]  as part of the marketing of a product,
[45:02.940 --> 45:05.400]  and that's outside just the simple rules
[45:05.400 --> 45:06.720]  of supply and demand.
[45:09.060 --> 45:11.660]  They're not looking to just price gauge
[45:11.660 --> 45:13.560]  what they can get right now, this year,
[45:13.560 --> 45:15.540]  this quarter for this product.
[45:15.540 --> 45:17.900]  It's about setting a value proposition
[45:17.900 --> 45:19.940]  for this product line for years to come.
[45:19.940 --> 45:22.620]  That's why the Mac Pro, as a perfect example,
[45:22.620 --> 45:23.580]  didn't drop in price,
[45:23.580 --> 45:26.980]  even when it wasn't updated for 17 years.
[45:26.980 --> 45:29.100]  Yeah, they don't want anyone to see
[45:29.100 --> 45:30.340]  a race to the bottom in their market.
[45:30.340 --> 45:31.860]  Right, because 18 years later,
[45:31.860 --> 45:33.580]  next year when they come out with the new Mac Pro,
[45:33.580 --> 45:35.900]  they still want those high price points.
[45:35.900 --> 45:37.040]  Absolutely.
[45:37.040 --> 45:38.820]  It's complete opposite of, say, Dell,
[45:38.820 --> 45:39.860]  and this drives people nuts
[45:39.860 --> 45:41.540]  who know what these components cost,
[45:41.540 --> 45:45.280]  but you go and configure a Dell whatever
[45:45.280 --> 45:47.880]  with this CPU and this much RAM,
[45:47.880 --> 45:49.200]  and it's this type of RAM.
[45:49.200 --> 45:54.060]  It's DDR4, whatever, and this graphics card,
[45:54.060 --> 45:56.740]  and you wait, and then you go back next week
[45:56.740 --> 45:58.020]  and configure the same machine,
[45:58.020 --> 45:59.900]  the price might be $20 lower.
[46:00.740 --> 46:02.540]  Dell actually swings their,
[46:02.540 --> 46:04.100]  and you get these weird prices
[46:05.100 --> 46:09.140]  that the system is gonna cost $1,373.
[46:09.140 --> 46:09.980]  They don't do-
[46:09.980 --> 46:11.100]  I'm not convinced if you log in again
[46:11.100 --> 46:11.940]  a few hours later,
[46:11.940 --> 46:13.580]  I won't just randomly give you a different price.
[46:13.580 --> 46:15.660]  Right, whereas Apple picks these numbers,
[46:15.660 --> 46:17.140]  the numbers are part of the pricing,
[46:17.140 --> 46:22.140]  and they tend to pick even numbers, like $9.99 or whatever.
[46:25.820 --> 46:28.740]  Prices, and the prices do not move as the year goes on.
[46:29.780 --> 46:31.180]  It's part of the marketing.
[46:33.020 --> 46:34.780]  Anyway, I wrote this article.
[46:36.420 --> 46:38.020]  Got some attention.
[46:38.020 --> 46:39.220]  It really, it got,
[46:39.220 --> 46:41.540]  I knew it was gonna make some people upset,
[46:41.540 --> 46:43.980]  but it surprised me how far outside
[46:43.980 --> 46:46.100]  the normal sphere of things it got.
[46:46.100 --> 46:49.260]  Like, I got a phone call or an email from CNBC.
[46:49.260 --> 46:53.020]  CNBC wanted me on in the afternoon on TV to talk about it,
[46:53.020 --> 46:54.740]  and I might have done it,
[46:54.740 --> 46:55.940]  depending on where they wanted me to go,
[46:55.940 --> 46:57.260]  but I was on vacation at the time.
[46:57.260 --> 46:58.880]  There's no way I could do it.
[46:59.940 --> 47:03.620]  But that does not happen typically for me with my articles.
[47:03.620 --> 47:07.220]  I mean, I'm not trying to be fake, humble,
[47:07.220 --> 47:08.820]  but you know my audience.
[47:08.820 --> 47:10.700]  I mean, I write, and it's popular,
[47:10.700 --> 47:13.020]  but it's popular within a very narrow niche.
[47:13.020 --> 47:15.340]  It's not the type of thing where I write a column
[47:15.340 --> 47:18.480]  for during Fireball, and CNBC wants me to talk about it.
[47:18.480 --> 47:19.320]  But this time it is.
[47:19.320 --> 47:20.140]  Yeah, you're not a sensationalist,
[47:20.140 --> 47:21.540]  which is typically what they favor.
[47:21.540 --> 47:24.060]  Right, although I think suggesting
[47:24.060 --> 47:26.980]  that the starting price might be as high as $1,200
[47:26.980 --> 47:28.620]  qualifies as sensational,
[47:28.620 --> 47:31.220]  but I think sensational in that it might be realistic.
[47:31.220 --> 47:33.480]  Well, you provided a lot of logic to back it up.
[47:33.480 --> 47:34.940]  It wasn't, you know, how,
[47:34.940 --> 47:36.060]  like someone else might have put a headline
[47:36.060 --> 47:37.340]  like Apple looking to gouge you
[47:37.340 --> 47:39.140]  for 1500 bucks on the next iPhone.
[47:39.140 --> 47:40.300]  Right.
[47:40.300 --> 47:42.660]  So anyway, you mentioned the Andy Warhol quote,
[47:42.660 --> 47:44.240]  and I've mentioned it many times before,
[47:44.240 --> 47:45.620]  and people have written to me,
[47:45.620 --> 47:48.820]  and I think I need to bring it up and respond to it.
[47:50.820 --> 47:51.820]  Many times over the years,
[47:51.820 --> 47:53.340]  I've mentioned that the iPhone reminds me
[47:53.340 --> 47:55.580]  of Andy Warhol's quote about Coca-Cola in America.
[47:55.580 --> 47:56.660]  Here's the quote.
[47:56.660 --> 47:57.500]  This is Andy Warhol.
[47:57.500 --> 47:58.900]  What's great about this country
[47:58.900 --> 48:00.740]  is that America started the tradition
[48:00.740 --> 48:01.980]  where the richest consumers
[48:01.980 --> 48:04.740]  buy essentially the same things as the poorest.
[48:04.740 --> 48:06.780]  You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola,
[48:06.780 --> 48:08.700]  and you know that the president drinks Coke,
[48:08.700 --> 48:10.100]  Liz Taylor drinks Coke,
[48:10.100 --> 48:12.460]  and just think, you can drink Coke too.
[48:12.460 --> 48:14.220]  A Coke is a Coke, and no amount of money
[48:14.220 --> 48:15.820]  can get you a better Coke
[48:15.820 --> 48:18.100]  than the one the bum on the corner is drinking.
[48:18.100 --> 48:20.640]  All the Cokes are the same, and all the Cokes are good.
[48:20.640 --> 48:22.580]  Liz Taylor knows it, the president knows it,
[48:22.580 --> 48:24.860]  the bum knows it, and you know it.
[48:24.860 --> 48:27.460]  It's a great quote, and it's totally true,
[48:27.460 --> 48:29.160]  but it was, or it was true.
[48:31.420 --> 48:33.780]  And there is some aspect of that to the iPhone,
[48:33.780 --> 48:38.780]  but Cokes cost like a dollar, you know.
[48:38.780 --> 48:43.780]  Cokes are things that a literal panhandler could afford.
[48:45.160 --> 48:49.280]  A bum on the corner really can buy a Coke, you know.
[48:49.280 --> 48:51.560]  I think a lot of them buy other beverages,
[48:51.560 --> 48:56.160]  but if they're really thirsty for a Coke, they can buy one.
[48:56.160 --> 48:57.000]  Yeah.
[48:57.000 --> 48:57.880]  They can't buy an iPhone.
[48:57.880 --> 48:59.680]  Like, let's face it, number one,
[48:59.680 --> 49:01.460]  the analogy breaks down to some degree,
[49:01.460 --> 49:04.000]  insofar as that the cheapest iPhone Apple has ever sold
[49:04.000 --> 49:07.760]  is in the grand scheme of this globe and humanity
[49:07.760 --> 49:10.760]  an extraordinarily expensive premium product.
[49:10.760 --> 49:12.100]  And I think they also, you know,
[49:12.100 --> 49:13.320]  that quote is absolutely true,
[49:13.320 --> 49:14.400]  but it doesn't really understand.
[49:14.400 --> 49:16.380]  Like Coke as a business sells Coke,
[49:16.380 --> 49:18.700]  but they would, sort of like Apple just selling iPhone,
[49:18.700 --> 49:20.200]  they would never have grown as a business
[49:20.200 --> 49:23.520]  if all they ever did was sell that one same Coke,
[49:23.520 --> 49:24.880]  which is why Coca-Cola is one,
[49:24.880 --> 49:26.360]  like if you would go and look at Coca-Cola,
[49:26.360 --> 49:28.120]  it's one of the most diversified companies you'll find.
[49:28.120 --> 49:30.280]  They have their fingers into almost everything,
[49:30.280 --> 49:31.900]  and they have whole lines of beverages
[49:31.900 --> 49:33.680]  that are more expensive than Coke.
[49:33.680 --> 49:35.320]  It's just they're smart about branding,
[49:35.320 --> 49:37.400]  and sometimes people don't know exactly what they do,
[49:37.400 --> 49:38.800]  but Pepsi has, what is it?
[49:38.800 --> 49:41.920]  Pepsi 1897 that has real sugar in it.
[49:41.920 --> 49:43.480]  And it costs more money.
[49:43.480 --> 49:44.320]  Yeah.
[49:44.320 --> 49:46.560]  And I personally do not care
[49:46.560 --> 49:48.320]  for the taste of Pepsi-Cola, I never have.
[49:48.320 --> 49:50.520]  I do enjoy the taste of a Coca-Cola.
[49:50.520 --> 49:52.160]  And at least here in United,
[49:52.160 --> 49:54.280]  do you guys have Mexican Coke up in Canada,
[49:54.280 --> 49:55.120]  or are you too far away?
[49:55.120 --> 49:56.580]  We have some, I don't know if it's similar,
[49:56.580 --> 49:59.320]  but we have kosher Coke that has real sugar in it.
[49:59.320 --> 50:00.520]  Then it might be very similar.
[50:00.520 --> 50:02.480]  So in America, there's this,
[50:03.840 --> 50:06.160]  it's to the point now where you can buy it at Target.
[50:06.160 --> 50:09.240]  It's really become almost a mass market.
[50:09.240 --> 50:11.280]  It seems like a Coca-Cola company at first
[50:11.280 --> 50:14.320]  was sort of almost trying to,
[50:14.320 --> 50:16.840]  almost considered it like a gray market product
[50:16.840 --> 50:19.200]  that they wanted retailers not to sell.
[50:19.200 --> 50:20.940]  And you'd have to go to,
[50:22.040 --> 50:22.880]  when I first heard of it,
[50:22.880 --> 50:26.000]  you had to go to Mexican restaurants,
[50:26.000 --> 50:27.960]  real Mexican restaurants here in the city,
[50:27.960 --> 50:31.200]  not like chain Mexican restaurants.
[50:31.200 --> 50:32.120]  No Taco Bell.
[50:32.120 --> 50:33.580]  Right, but like a little mom and pop
[50:33.580 --> 50:34.500]  real Mexican restaurant,
[50:34.500 --> 50:36.080]  and they would sell Mexican Coca-Cola
[50:36.080 --> 50:37.400]  because in Mexico,
[50:37.400 --> 50:39.840]  like there's this whole complicated,
[50:39.840 --> 50:41.280]  I don't wanna go too far into it.
[50:41.280 --> 50:42.480]  I think most people probably know it,
[50:42.480 --> 50:44.300]  but because the United States is,
[50:44.300 --> 50:45.520]  A, grows a lot of corn,
[50:45.520 --> 50:48.760]  and B, because of weird government subsidies,
[50:48.760 --> 50:51.800]  ends up paying farmers to grow way more corn
[50:51.800 --> 50:53.600]  than anybody would ever actually eat
[50:53.600 --> 50:56.040]  in terms of eating things that are made with corn.
[50:57.160 --> 51:00.380]  It actually is super cheap to use excess corn
[51:00.380 --> 51:02.060]  to turn it into corn syrup,
[51:02.060 --> 51:03.720]  which is a form of sugar
[51:03.720 --> 51:05.840]  that it becomes phenomenally cheaper
[51:05.840 --> 51:09.360]  than cane sugar made from sugar cane.
[51:09.360 --> 51:13.360]  And the hitch is that corn syrup,
[51:13.360 --> 51:15.160]  most people do not consider things that are,
[51:15.160 --> 51:17.880]  if you substitute corn syrup for cane sugar
[51:17.880 --> 51:18.880]  in most recipes,
[51:18.880 --> 51:20.600]  it does not taste as good.
[51:20.600 --> 51:21.800]  It's nowhere near as different
[51:21.800 --> 51:24.200]  as substituting a sugar substitute,
[51:24.200 --> 51:26.200]  you know, like what's in Diet Coke
[51:26.200 --> 51:28.000]  or Coke Zero or something like that.
[51:30.120 --> 51:31.760]  But it's definitely a difference.
[51:31.760 --> 51:34.480]  And I don't know anybody who can't taste test
[51:34.480 --> 51:37.220]  the difference between a corn syrup Coke and a,
[51:37.220 --> 51:38.480]  well, I'm sure there are some people
[51:38.480 --> 51:40.480]  who just don't drink sugared stuff, period,
[51:40.480 --> 51:41.360]  but I could easily,
[51:41.360 --> 51:43.520]  I would bet thousands of dollars
[51:43.520 --> 51:44.880]  that I could Pepsi challenge the difference
[51:44.880 --> 51:47.280]  between a corn syrup Coke and a Mexican Coke.
[51:47.280 --> 51:48.120]  And I prefer the Mexican Coke.
[51:48.120 --> 51:49.120]  They have Pepsi Retro, I think, too,
[51:49.120 --> 51:50.880]  which is the same sugar-based Coke.
[51:50.880 --> 51:52.000]  Well, anyway, guess what?
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.960]  Mexican Coke tastes, or it costs more money.
[51:54.960 --> 51:58.080]  So you can buy a better Coke.
[51:58.080 --> 52:00.880]  Not all the Cokes are the same anymore.
[52:00.880 --> 52:02.120]  And they test a lot of things,
[52:02.120 --> 52:02.960]  and some of them fail,
[52:02.960 --> 52:03.780]  and they get rid of them,
[52:03.780 --> 52:05.200]  they succeed, they double down on them,
[52:05.200 --> 52:07.160]  which I think is what Apple needs to do.
[52:07.160 --> 52:10.400]  Yeah, my favorite part of this,
[52:10.400 --> 52:13.200]  and again, it's just a thing that popped into my head,
[52:13.200 --> 52:18.200]  and it is obviously a first-world privilege-type situation.
[52:19.120 --> 52:21.880]  But I remember, I've told this story before,
[52:21.880 --> 52:24.640]  one of the, when I used to go to South by Southwest,
[52:24.640 --> 52:26.360]  so I don't know, it was before,
[52:26.360 --> 52:28.160]  I think it's been at least four or five years since I did,
[52:28.160 --> 52:30.840]  but sometime four or five years ago, roughly,
[52:30.840 --> 52:34.680]  where I was at South by Southwest,
[52:34.680 --> 52:39.680]  and some friends and I went out to a steak dinner,
[52:41.320 --> 52:43.200]  and we had a nice little meal,
[52:43.200 --> 52:44.800]  and as we were leaving,
[52:46.440 --> 52:48.800]  and South by Southwest takes place in Austin, Texas,
[52:48.800 --> 52:50.960]  we were leaving, people had to go to the restroom
[52:50.960 --> 52:55.360]  before we left, or waiting to get seated,
[52:55.360 --> 52:58.040]  standing by himself was Michael Dell.
[52:58.040 --> 52:59.840]  And I knew who he was, and I was like,
[52:59.840 --> 53:02.240]  wow, there's Michael Dell.
[53:02.240 --> 53:07.240]  And he was poking at some kind of Windows-based cell phone.
[53:08.440 --> 53:10.420]  And I thought, wow, there's Michael Dell, a billionaire,
[53:10.420 --> 53:14.400]  great innovator, guy who truly changed the world.
[53:14.400 --> 53:15.520]  He was the guy who more or less invented
[53:15.520 --> 53:17.120]  the PC clone business.
[53:18.320 --> 53:19.680]  And a lot of supply chain stuff,
[53:19.680 --> 53:20.720]  and logistical management.
[53:20.720 --> 53:23.720]  Right, all sorts of stuff.
[53:23.720 --> 53:25.480]  Well-deserved, tremendous success.
[53:25.480 --> 53:27.260]  But there he is using, I don't know if it was,
[53:27.260 --> 53:29.220]  I don't even know if Dell made phones,
[53:29.220 --> 53:30.400]  but he wasn't using an iPhone,
[53:30.400 --> 53:32.720]  he was using some kind of Windows phone type thing.
[53:32.720 --> 53:34.720]  So my first thought is, wow, there's Michael Dell.
[53:34.720 --> 53:36.580]  And then my second thought was, holy shit,
[53:36.580 --> 53:39.720]  I have a better cell phone than Michael Dell.
[53:39.720 --> 53:40.560]  Yeah.
[53:42.000 --> 53:45.040]  And then I thought, I presume that Bill Gates
[53:45.040 --> 53:47.600]  doesn't use an iPhone, that he was, at least at the time,
[53:47.600 --> 53:51.560]  because Microsoft was still trying to be
[53:51.560 --> 53:56.560]  a part of, a provider of mobile phone platforms.
[53:59.920 --> 54:01.880]  I thought, holy shit, wherever Bill Gates is,
[54:01.880 --> 54:04.920]  I have a better cell phone than Bill Gates.
[54:04.920 --> 54:06.640]  There's nothing that he can do,
[54:06.640 --> 54:09.820]  the richest man in the world who cares about computers.
[54:09.820 --> 54:11.760]  Both of these guys obviously care about computers.
[54:11.760 --> 54:13.340]  There's nothing they can do, no amount of money
[54:13.340 --> 54:16.140]  that they can spend to get a better cell phone
[54:16.140 --> 54:21.140]  than the one I had as a guy who runs Daring Fireball.
[54:22.260 --> 54:24.840]  And that's sort of the thinking in my mind
[54:24.840 --> 54:27.280]  behind the analogy to the Coca-Cola thing.
[54:27.280 --> 54:29.800]  It breaks down so easily because, like I said,
[54:29.800 --> 54:32.120]  there are billions of people on the planet,
[54:32.120 --> 54:35.040]  the most, more people on the planet than there are
[54:35.040 --> 54:37.020]  who can afford an iPhone, even if they wanted one,
[54:37.020 --> 54:39.720]  who can't, can't possibly afford one.
[54:39.720 --> 54:42.760]  So that analogy breaks down.
[54:42.760 --> 54:44.440]  And the other problem with it, too,
[54:44.440 --> 54:46.040]  is that even if I'm exactly right
[54:46.040 --> 54:48.480]  and that the iPhone X or iPhone Pro
[54:48.480 --> 54:49.920]  or whatever it's gonna be called,
[54:49.920 --> 54:53.880]  costs, starts at $1,200 and goes to like $1,400 or $1,500
[54:53.880 --> 54:57.380]  or something like that, that's not a luxury product.
[54:57.380 --> 54:59.060]  I mean, it is by some standards,
[54:59.060 --> 55:00.440]  but it's not like the difference
[55:00.440 --> 55:02.740]  between a Honda and a Ferrari.
[55:04.200 --> 55:09.120]  It's more like the difference between a Honda and a Acura
[55:09.120 --> 55:10.960]  or something like that.
[55:10.960 --> 55:12.960]  It is not something that's outside.
[55:12.960 --> 55:14.520]  It might be more than people want to pay,
[55:14.520 --> 55:17.880]  but most people, a lot of people who can afford
[55:17.880 --> 55:22.880]  a $969 iPhone 7 Plus could, if they so choose,
[55:23.640 --> 55:26.600]  also afford a $1,200 iPhone Pro.
[55:26.600 --> 55:29.660]  They just may not be happy about the extra $200 in price,
[55:29.660 --> 55:33.240]  but it's not like it's trying to ask somebody to buy.
[55:34.560 --> 55:36.320]  Perfect example, it's not like trying to ask somebody
[55:36.320 --> 55:38.660]  to buy a $20,000 gold Apple Watch.
[55:39.600 --> 55:41.280]  No, and I know a lot of people who buy the Honda
[55:41.280 --> 55:42.840]  instead of the Acura and then laugh at the person
[55:42.840 --> 55:44.320]  who wasted their money on the Acura.
[55:44.320 --> 55:46.120]  I mean, people are funny in all different ways.
[55:46.120 --> 55:50.100]  Right, right, and there's some people,
[55:50.100 --> 55:53.480]  and I think that my audience and your audience,
[55:53.480 --> 55:56.320]  our collective audience, are skewed by the fact
[55:56.320 --> 55:59.000]  that the whole reason they are our audience
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.360]  and they're listening to us go on and on about this
[56:01.360 --> 56:03.080]  is because they care really deeply about this,
[56:03.080 --> 56:05.600]  and they really know exactly what the difference is
[56:05.600 --> 56:08.220]  between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 6S.
[56:08.220 --> 56:10.160]  And whether they chose to buy one or not,
[56:10.160 --> 56:11.640]  they know exactly what they're missing out on
[56:11.640 --> 56:12.520]  if they didn't buy it,
[56:12.520 --> 56:14.060]  and they know exactly what they're getting
[56:14.060 --> 56:16.120]  if they do buy it and upgrade from whatever iPhone
[56:16.120 --> 56:18.880]  that they had, and they're tuned into these rumors,
[56:18.880 --> 56:20.840]  and they really are excited about the idea
[56:20.840 --> 56:23.240]  of an iPhone that maybe has an exciting
[56:23.240 --> 56:27.440]  new industrial design, and they've been basing their hopes
[56:27.440 --> 56:29.440]  on the assumption that they'll be getting it
[56:29.440 --> 56:31.760]  for $600 or $700.
[56:33.440 --> 56:34.380]  Yeah, totally.
[56:35.340 --> 56:36.240]  And I get it.
[56:38.280 --> 56:39.120]  I think the hard thing is,
[56:39.120 --> 56:40.640]  because a lot of the feedback that you and I got
[56:40.640 --> 56:43.600]  is that why are you not attacking Apple over this?
[56:43.600 --> 56:44.880]  Why are you not standing up for us
[56:44.880 --> 56:46.680]  and telling Apple this is bad?
[56:46.680 --> 56:48.300]  And I don't know about you, but my strategy is
[56:48.300 --> 56:49.920]  when there's rumors about Apple's things,
[56:49.920 --> 56:52.360]  I wanna understand it first, because nothing exists.
[56:52.360 --> 56:53.800]  These products have not been announced yet.
[56:53.800 --> 56:56.420]  Apple's revealed no products, no pricing, nothing.
[56:56.420 --> 56:57.720]  All we have is speculation,
[56:57.720 --> 57:00.120]  and I wanna sort of see if it's valid or not,
[57:00.120 --> 57:02.600]  and the only way I can do that is sort of try to understand
[57:02.600 --> 57:05.200]  if Apple is doing this, what world does it make sense?
[57:05.200 --> 57:07.400]  Because Apple's usually a pretty logical company.
[57:07.400 --> 57:09.760]  What world does it make sense for Apple to do this?
[57:09.760 --> 57:11.420]  And I'm not gonna take a position on it yet
[57:11.420 --> 57:13.380]  because I'm still trying to understand it.
[57:13.380 --> 57:15.000]  It's sort of like Nilay's famous article
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.800]  about the headphone jack being user hostile and stupid.
[57:17.800 --> 57:19.400]  That was written before it launched,
[57:19.400 --> 57:21.760]  and I think that's a fine article to write
[57:21.760 --> 57:24.560]  when it's launched, because if you write it based on rumors,
[57:24.560 --> 57:25.920]  Apple's already made that phone.
[57:25.920 --> 57:28.320]  There's nothing you can do to have them go
[57:28.320 --> 57:29.760]  and have Phil Shiller to use a little hammer
[57:29.760 --> 57:32.720]  and knock a headphone jack, but it doesn't really exist,
[57:32.720 --> 57:34.720]  so you can try to understand it, but once it launches,
[57:34.720 --> 57:37.160]  I'll take an opinion on whether I think it's good or not.
[57:37.160 --> 57:38.640]  Now I just wanna understand it.
[57:38.640 --> 57:43.640]  Right, well, I got in even further trouble
[57:44.000 --> 57:45.520]  because the first time I mentioned this
[57:45.520 --> 57:47.200]  wasn't even in an article devoted to it,
[57:47.200 --> 57:49.840]  but in a, I forget what I linked to,
[57:49.840 --> 57:52.160]  but I linked to something, and offhandedly,
[57:52.160 --> 57:55.680]  I tossed out the idea, and I guess I was being slightly,
[57:55.680 --> 57:56.920]  sensationalist is the wrong term,
[57:56.920 --> 57:58.100]  because I didn't put it in a headline.
[57:58.100 --> 58:01.080]  It wasn't clickbait, but I at least wanted
[58:01.080 --> 58:04.160]  to poke the bee's nest, and I said,
[58:04.160 --> 58:07.120]  you know, what if it just, what if it starts at 15?
[58:07.120 --> 58:10.240]  What if the starting price for this new iPhone is $1,500?
[58:10.240 --> 58:12.440]  And I said, and I was saying that I would,
[58:12.440 --> 58:15.620]  I think that would be a good idea, or I would like that,
[58:16.880 --> 58:18.080]  and when I really thought about it,
[58:18.080 --> 58:19.600]  I think 1,500 is probably too high,
[58:19.600 --> 58:21.400]  and when I really thought about it,
[58:21.400 --> 58:23.300]  I came up with 1,200 as the starting price,
[58:23.300 --> 58:25.640]  but I still think that I would like that,
[58:25.640 --> 58:27.480]  and some people took it the wrong way
[58:27.480 --> 58:29.240]  of me saying I would like it
[58:29.240 --> 58:31.720]  because I think I'll be able to afford that,
[58:31.720 --> 58:35.360]  and then I'll have an iPhone that fewer people can afford.
[58:35.360 --> 58:37.040]  It's like an elitist thing.
[58:37.040 --> 58:39.280]  And elitist thing, and that is absolutely not
[58:39.280 --> 58:41.280]  the way I look at it at all.
[58:41.280 --> 58:42.520]  I really don't.
[58:42.520 --> 58:45.960]  I actually, and again, the people who have a better argument
[58:45.960 --> 58:49.000]  or at least demand a more nuanced argument for me,
[58:49.000 --> 58:50.880]  which I hope I've been able to deliver so far
[58:50.880 --> 58:54.180]  here on this show, is that analogy to the Coke thing,
[58:54.180 --> 58:56.980]  which I still stand behind and I still like, right?
[58:58.520 --> 59:02.640]  I don't say this because I think I want a phone
[59:02.640 --> 59:03.880]  that other people can't afford.
[59:03.880 --> 59:06.740]  I certainly didn't buy the gold Apple Watch.
[59:09.200 --> 59:12.720]  I bought the stainless steel one, the space black one,
[59:12.720 --> 59:14.560]  and ultimately regret it.
[59:14.560 --> 59:16.560]  I actually think the best, I've said this before,
[59:16.560 --> 59:20.160]  I think the best Apple Watch is the sport models,
[59:20.160 --> 59:22.680]  or they don't really call them that anymore,
[59:22.680 --> 59:26.720]  but like the Nike ones and the ones that,
[59:26.720 --> 59:28.820]  the ones that are made of aluminum.
[59:28.820 --> 59:29.720]  I think they're the best ones.
[59:29.720 --> 59:31.360]  I think they actually have better haptics.
[59:31.360 --> 59:32.440]  I think that they're actually,
[59:32.440 --> 59:34.140]  I think that the material that they're made out of
[59:34.140 --> 59:38.160]  is actually more honest to the product.
[59:39.500 --> 59:40.720]  The only thing I really like better
[59:40.720 --> 59:42.400]  about the stainless steel ones
[59:42.400 --> 59:44.600]  is that they have the sapphire.
[59:44.600 --> 59:45.440]  Yes.
[59:45.440 --> 59:48.400]  The sapphire front, which is truly scratch proof.
[59:48.400 --> 59:50.320]  Like an aluminum one with a sapphire front
[59:50.320 --> 59:51.480]  would be ideal to me.
[59:54.520 --> 59:56.160]  So it's not elitism.
[59:56.160 --> 59:59.400]  It's what I hope to go into in the rest of the show,
[59:59.400 --> 01:00:03.240]  which is that I really think that Apple's current strategy
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:04.540]  is not sustainable,
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:10.420]  or at least opens them up to certain risks.
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:12.840]  Yeah, I think it's also interesting
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:16.540]  because there are a few dangers with Apple punditry,
[01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:20.660]  and that is when you have angry critic yelling at the clouds,
[01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:22.580]  Apple gets trained to just dismiss it.
[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:25.560]  Like people said, making a gold colored iPhone is stupid.
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.440]  It was made fun of on Conan.
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.560]  People said it was gonna be garish.
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:29.480]  There was so many jokes.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:32.440]  And then when it shipped and people actually saw it,
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.360]  the complaints rapidly turned to why can't I get them?
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:35.300]  Why didn't Apple make enough?
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:36.560]  Why are they jerks?
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.720]  And AirPods was the same.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:38.600]  These are stupid.
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.920]  Like why is Apple making these?
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:40.960]  What a way, how terrible.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.520]  And then it quickly shifted to these are terrific.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.720]  Why can't I get them?
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.760]  And Apple, I think that was part of the problem
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.520]  with the touch bar is that Apple is so used
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.000]  to people telling them that everything,
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.120]  every rumor is garbage,
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:52.800]  that they've become desensitized to legitimate criticism.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:55.640]  And that's why I'm very careful about what and when
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:56.920]  I choose to sort of apply that
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.920]  because otherwise it'll be a bunch of people saying,
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:00.840]  oh, this new iPhone is stupid before it ships
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:02.340]  and Apple go, ah, you always say that.
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:03.640]  Yeah, all right, let me take another break here
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.880]  and thank our next sponsor.
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:10.880]  It's HulloPillow, H-U-L-L-O, pronounced Hullo.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.640]  Have you ever tried a buckwheat pillow?
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:15.800]  They are totally different than the fluffy soft pillows
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:16.920]  most of us are used to.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.540]  They're similar to a bean bag,
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:22.100]  which allows you to adjust its shape and thickness.
[01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:23.880]  Kind of heavy too.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.140]  It supports your head and neck how you want it to.
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:28.000]  Unlike traditional squishy soft pillows,
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.720]  which collapse under the weight of your head,
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:33.980]  soft pillows allow your neck to fall on a downward bend,
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:36.520]  adding uncomfortable pressure to nerves
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.480]  and discs and muscles.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.080]  HulloPillow really supports your neck,
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:41.740]  it supports your head.
[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.080]  And also, and this is important,
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.360]  we talked about the weather,
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.920]  it stays cool and dry compared to pillows
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:50.040]  filled with feathers or foam.
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:53.000]  Most pillows absorb and retain body heat and moisture,
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.760]  making your pillow feel warm and humid
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:55.720]  the longer you lay on it.
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.780]  Buckwheat tends to breathe better,
[01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:00.800]  no more flipping to the cool side of the pillow.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:01.640]  You don't need to do that.
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.340]  I can vouch for it.
[01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:04.760]  Again, we have them here.
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:07.040]  We're pretty much, the sponsors on this episode
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:09.020]  are pretty much the things we sleep on here
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:10.420]  in the Gruber household.
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:13.960]  The mattress, the pillow.
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.600]  They've sent me some.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:16.440]  We love them.
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:17.520]  My wife, this is actually the thing
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.760]  my wife misses when we travel.
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.220]  She not so much cares about the mattress,
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:24.320]  but really misses the pillow.
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.460]  She actually, she wants to,
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:29.400]  she did this on her own podcast, Just The Tip.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.760]  She loved doing the reeds.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.340]  I think she made Paul Kvassest do the reeds
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:33.200]  for most of the sponsors,
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.720]  but when they had Hello Pillow as a sponsor,
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:35.680]  she insisted on doing it
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.320]  because she loves this pillow so much.
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:39.720]  It's like one of her favorite things.
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:41.600]  It does sound weird.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.200]  Like you think it's like a bean bag?
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.980]  That is not like a pillow that I've ever seen anywhere else.
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:47.360]  I've never heard of it before.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.360]  They sent me one and started sponsoring the show.
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:50.840]  It is totally different.
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:54.000]  It is not like somehow they've turned a bean bag-like pillow
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.240]  into something that is light and fluffy
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.500]  like a feather-filled pillow.
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:58.700]  It is totally different.
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.160]  And you first put your head on it
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.920]  and you can hear that there's beans in there.
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:03.960]  You're like, this is a little weird.
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.820]  I don't know about it.
[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:07.680]  But then you actually give it a try
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.440]  and whew, it is different and it is good.
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:14.960]  Do you use two pillows or fold one pillow
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.320]  to get your proper support?
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.900]  I, that's what I used to do.
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.220]  That's a sign that your pillow isn't firm enough
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:23.060]  or thick enough.
[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:23.880]  Hello, pillow.
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:24.720]  You don't need two pillows.
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:27.320]  You just have one and it does the job.
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:31.080]  And you can add or remove fill from the zippered opening.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:34.300]  So if you feel like the one that you get has too much,
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:36.760]  you'd rather have it have even less support.
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:40.600]  You just unzip it, take some of the buckwheat things out,
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.500]  zip it back up and you're ready to go.
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.460]  Again, this is another product that is made in the USA
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:49.240]  with quality construction and materials.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:51.660]  And, and here's the deal.
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:53.680]  You think, I just don't know about this.
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:56.400]  Buying a premium pillow without even feeling it or whatever.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.840]  They have a 60 night sleep on it guarantee.
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.240]  So you buy it, try it for 60 days.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.780]  And again, if you don't like it, send it back.
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.840]  They'll take it for free and give you a full refund.
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.680]  You cannot lose.
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:10.480]  So if you're in any way dissatisfied
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.320]  with your current pillows,
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.460]  if you've got like a crick in your neck
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:14.260]  or just a crick in your neck every once in a while,
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:16.200]  just from sleeping, give them a try.
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.480]  It's a great product.
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:18.960]  Really do sleep on it.
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:19.980]  I sleep on one every night.
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:20.900]  My wife does too.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.500]  Wouldn't say it if it weren't true.

[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:05.840]  So we're talking about this idea of what if,
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:09.500]  what if this new fancy OLED phone
[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:12.200]  is a higher-end, new tier?
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.800]  I don't think, and I wrote, I tried to emphasize this.
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:19.240]  I just don't think it's getting through people's heads,
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:24.240]  some people, just how unbelievably difficult
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:29.300]  it is for Apple to produce iPhones at the scale
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.060]  that they produce every year.
[01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.360]  I think last year they sold around 70 million iPhones
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.340]  in the first quarter that the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus went
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:40.160]  on sale, and just by looking at average selling prices,
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:42.980]  which is what they, they don't break down unit sales.
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.720]  I mean, Apple is a little bit more forthcoming
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.080]  with iPhone sales than,
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.140]  they're more forthcoming than any other company
[01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:49.760]  in the phone business.
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.800]  And they're more forthcoming than they are
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:54.380]  with like Apple Watch and stuff like that.
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:56.720]  But they don't break down by model.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:00.920]  They give some hints in the quarterly finance calls.
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:05.800]  Like we learned last year that they underestimated
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:08.440]  the demand for the 7 Plus.
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.280]  Yes.
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.400]  And that touches back on what I said earlier,
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.580]  which is that Apple is not,
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:15.760]  they don't have a perfect forecast for these things.
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:16.600]  I think what happened-
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.440]  The best forecasting has been like the SE,
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.860]  the Undimated Demand for the smaller phone.
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:21.960]  It's been a few of those.
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:26.660]  Yeah, the SE, really, I think they were way off.
[01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:28.120]  They were, that thing was, you know,
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:30.160]  you would think that that would be one of the easier
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.240]  to produce devices,
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:34.480]  because the form factor was the same as the 5S,
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:39.480]  and it was using the then six month old system on a chip.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:44.200]  And instead they so vastly underestimated it
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.320]  that it was behind for months before they-
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:48.120]  The rumor was that they thought people would buy it
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:49.280]  because it was less expensive,
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:50.400]  and they didn't realize how many would buy it
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:51.600]  simply because it was smaller.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.160]  Yep, exactly.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.880]  And everybody I know who has one bought it
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:55.720]  because it's smaller.
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:00.380]  I have a ton of friends who own and love the SE
[01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:02.240]  simply because it's smaller.
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.080]  Yeah.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:07.320]  And especially because the 7 Plus was more expensive
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:08.800]  than the previous Plus phones have been.
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:10.240]  I think it was 20 bucks more.
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:12.560]  And they thought maybe that would dampen enthusiasm for it,
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.920]  but instead the dual camera system was enough.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:16.600]  And I think that was too late
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.120]  to sort of change their thinking on this,
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:19.600]  but if they did have any reservations
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.160]  about whether they could test the upper price elasticity,
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.960]  I think that quickly evaporated them.
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:28.080]  Yeah, and I think that that term price elasticity
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.720]  is an important one to think about,
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:32.580]  which is that Apple has not really tested it.
[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:34.280]  I mean, they've sort of tested it slightly
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:36.680]  with the first Plus models,
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:40.080]  and they tested it even more last year
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:43.240]  by adding $20 to the cost of the Plus models,
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:46.760]  and having a very compelling, I think.
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:50.680]  I think, in hindsight, the dual camera system
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:52.440]  is a very big selling point.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.240]  I think enough people, casual users of the iPhone,
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:59.120]  see it as, whether they think of it that way or not,
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:02.640]  they probably think of it as a communications device first,
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:07.280]  texting and messaging and reading webpages
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:09.760]  and the stuff you do, everybody does.
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.500]  And I think as a camera second,
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:14.820]  and I think being able to take better photos,
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:18.940]  in some cases, noticeably better photos, right?
[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:22.580]  And in a worse case, exactly equal to the iPhone 7, right?
[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:26.820]  If you're using the wider angle lens,
[01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:28.740]  in most conditions, the worst you're going to do
[01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:32.220]  is get the exact same photo you'd gotten on the iPhone 7.
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:34.140]  And in other cases, like with portrait mode,
[01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:36.880]  when portrait mode works, it is unbelievable.
[01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:39.380]  It really is, in my opinion.
[01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:41.940]  I think it's emotional, right?
[01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:44.220]  I just can't believe it came from a phone, I really can't.
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:47.300]  As somebody who still shoots a lot of photos
[01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:49.320]  using quote-unquote real cameras,
[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:54.860]  before we went on vacation, we had a family wedding,
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:59.300]  and it was down in South Carolina,
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:02.420]  and the family rented a beach house
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:04.020]  for people to stay at for a couple of days,
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:06.440]  because it's a lot of family who doesn't get to see
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:09.180]  each other regularly, people from all over the place.
[01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:13.980]  So I took my Fuji X100S and shot a whole bunch of photos
[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:16.340]  there, and there were some of them,
[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:18.820]  and I would just as a test, because I'm a nerd,
[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:21.060]  even when I'm at a family outing like that,
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:23.380]  I'm doing stuff like this, where I'm taking a photo
[01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:25.580]  with the X100S, and I quick take out my iPhone
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:27.660]  and take the exact same photo, and then later go back
[01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:29.300]  and look at it on a big screen
[01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:32.700]  and see what the difference is, and I could see it.
[01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:34.300]  There were some cases where I took a photo,
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.120]  and I was like, wow, this is why it's worth it.
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:39.980]  Don't be a dummy and never take your X100S out with you.
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:42.820]  Sometimes you really, if it's an event like that, do it.
[01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:49.380]  But then I also, I still have the RED 7 Plus review unit.
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:52.140]  When the RED phone came out, Apple sent me a review unit
[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:55.740]  for that, probably around the time I should send it back,
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:58.760]  but I still had it, and I took some photos with that
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:01.320]  when I was on vacation, and some of the portrait mode
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.480]  photos, I cannot believe that they were from a phone,
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:05.180]  that they gave me the same feeling I got
[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:07.160]  when I looked at the photos from the X100S
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.820]  compared to the same photo on the 7,
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:13.820]  and just in terms of, it's not just the trickery
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.740]  of having a blurred out background, it's like you said,
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:20.260]  it's like an emotional truth to the photo that isn't there.
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:21.100]  So it's compelling, and it's only-
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:23.380]  IOS 11's even better at it in their lower light,
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:25.740]  so they're just working, they're continuing to improve it
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:28.060]  through software, which you can't do on a normal camera.
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:30.020]  Right, and that's before they tell us about
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:31.480]  whatever improvements they've made
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:33.660]  to dual-camera hardware technology, right,
[01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:37.580]  that for 7 Plus users, IOS 11 is going to be
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:40.340]  a significant camera update, it's pretty exciting.
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.300]  So I think what happened in hindsight with demand
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:51.220]  was that so many people were waiting for a big iPhone,
[01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:53.640]  quote, unquote, big one, that the iPhone 6 Plus
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:55.380]  was more popular than they expected,
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:57.340]  because they knew there was pent-up demand.
[01:10:57.340 --> 01:11:00.740]  Famously, it came out in the Samsung emails
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:04.020]  that had to be released during the Samsung lawsuit,
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:07.660]  where there was a slide presentation that before iPhone,
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:10.640]  I think around 2013 or so, that the quote was,
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.620]  this is from an Apple internal presentation,
[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:15.160]  consumers want what we don't have, bigger phones.
[01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:17.980]  So they knew that, they knew that.
[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:20.820]  I think even they underestimated it.
[01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:24.140]  And then I think with the 6S, they were like,
[01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:27.060]  well, these Plus phones, we underestimated them,
[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:28.220]  we'll make more of them.
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:31.820]  And then with the 6S Plus, it was a little bit,
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.660]  they overshot demand for that.
[01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:36.540]  And then with the 7, I think they went back to,
[01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:39.740]  well, I think the 6 Plus was popular
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:41.100]  just because there was pent-up demand,
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:42.700]  so we'll decrease it this time.
[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:44.780]  And I think they underestimated just how compelling
[01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:46.380]  the dual camera was going to be.
[01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:50.260]  Yeah, it wasn't about the size, it was about the camera.
[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:53.060]  But moving the upper price all the way to 969
[01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:55.660]  is certainly starting to stretch,
[01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:59.460]  to test the limits of price elasticity.
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:03.540]  But anyway, even with the Plus phones though,
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:05.840]  they still have to make them in massive quantities,
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:09.740]  truly massive, tens of millions per quarter quantities.
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:12.080]  And it's amazing, people have talked before
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:13.740]  about how it's a miracle that Windows boots up
[01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:15.300]  on as much hardware as it does every time.
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:16.740]  And it's become an equal miracle
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:18.940]  that Apple can get every single component
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:21.980]  of the 100 million iPhones they need to produce ready
[01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:23.940]  by the same sort of September deadline every year.
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:25.920]  Right, yeah, it's unbelievable.
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:29.660]  And I think, and there's been a lot of stuff recently
[01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:32.100]  because we just passed the 10-year anniversary
[01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:34.740]  of the original iPhone shipping to consumers.
[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:38.180]  I think people forget just how much the original iPhone
[01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:43.180]  was a sort of, we can't make many of these sort of device.
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:47.420]  I think Apple famously, Steve Jobs said famously
[01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:49.340]  that they were hoping to sell 10 million iPhones
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:51.540]  by the end of the next year.
[01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:53.480]  So in other words, like in the first 18 months
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:57.100]  that it was on sale, they wanted to sell 10 million phones.
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:00.780]  And they surpassed that, but not by much.
[01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:03.460]  It was a pretty good ballpark estimate.
[01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:08.820]  And now, of course, they sell 200 to 300 million per year.
[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:11.420]  But they couldn't have sold, it makes sense.
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:15.020]  It's one of those jumping the chasm marketing things
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:16.540]  where obviously the first iPhone,
[01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:19.340]  even no matter how much consumer awareness there was
[01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:20.740]  and no matter how much goodwill
[01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:23.820]  and how many happy iPod users they had out there,
[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:28.700]  the idea of buying a 600 or $700 phone
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:30.220]  and the idea of buying something
[01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:34.060]  with this all new touchscreen technology
[01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:36.660]  where there's no button, no hardware button
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:38.420]  to make a phone call or to hang up
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:41.500]  or no hardware keypad to dial phone numbers
[01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:44.220]  was the sort of thing that,
[01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:46.100]  of course it was going to take a couple of years
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:48.500]  for the mass market to move there.
[01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:51.340]  But even if somehow magically there had been demand
[01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:54.460]  for 100 million iPhones in that first year,
[01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:55.420]  Apple couldn't have made them.
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:57.100]  There's no way they could have made them.
[01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.840]  They were on one carrier in one country
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.220]  and even then, it was only people
[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:02.300]  who were not on a contract
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:03.940]  who were willing to break their contract to get it
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:04.940]  that they had to sort of service.
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:05.780]  Right.
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:10.260]  To me, it makes sense as...
[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:11.820]  I can't think of any other product
[01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:13.220]  that's quite like the iPhone
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:16.500]  where the best-selling market or best-selling product
[01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:20.540]  is the highest-tiered one year after year after year.
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:25.220]  And it's been fantastic for Apple financially
[01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:28.860]  and it's been exciting for consumers
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:31.540]  and so far is that you can always go in
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:34.020]  and whether you upgrade every year or two years
[01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:35.940]  or every three years, you can go in
[01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:39.540]  and for the same price get the quote best iPhone.
[01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:42.980]  I don't think it's sustainable
[01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:46.420]  at the quantities that they've reached at this point.
[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:47.380]  No, and it's also not...
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:49.380]  One of the biggest challenges Apple's had
[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:50.420]  in the market is growth.
[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:51.780]  It doesn't matter how much you've sold,
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:53.980]  it matters how much more you are going to sell
[01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:55.220]  and eventually, they'll get to the point
[01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:57.300]  where there's just every human who wants an iPhone has one
[01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:58.740]  and there's no Apple stores on Mars
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:01.320]  so you have to start adding other markets.
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.160]  Well, you literally do.
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.340]  You have to start adding other markets and they did that.
[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:05.820]  They were like, everyone who was on AT&T
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:07.940]  or willing to switch to AT&T has an iPhone
[01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:10.260]  so we have to add Verizon and international carriers
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:12.140]  and then everyone had those.
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:13.440]  Finally, they got China Mobile.
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.820]  So the easy growth steps
[01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:17.240]  by just simply adding more territories were done
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:18.980]  and then it was everybody who was willing
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:22.620]  to have an under four inch phone had one
[01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:23.780]  and if they wanted to grow the market,
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:25.200]  they had to add an over four inch phone
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:26.460]  because that's the only part of the market
[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:28.300]  that Samsung was actually dominating
[01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:31.020]  was the premium phone market over four inches in size
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:34.620]  so they added 4.7 and 5.5
[01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:36.020]  and then those people bought iPhones
[01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:38.480]  and then it was, well, are we leaving space underneath this?
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.660]  Are we creating an umbrella?
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:42.760]  We can't keep addressing it with things like the last phone.
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:44.540]  Can we make a phone that appeals?
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:46.580]  That's like a TV show, not like a big blockbuster movie
[01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:47.540]  but that's like a TV show
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:49.180]  and people will buy it and it's less expensive
[01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:50.740]  and maybe it was the wrong product
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:52.260]  or maybe that's not a good market for Apple
[01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:54.080]  or whatever reason, it didn't work
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:55.660]  but there's still other questions.
[01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:58.860]  Can we grow the market by creating a premium tier
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:01.060]  where people would love the iPhone so much
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:02.980]  they're willing to buy more iPhone from us
[01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:04.700]  and all you can do in business
[01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:06.620]  is annex the next nearest neighbor market
[01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:08.860]  and that's sort of what Apple has been strategically doing.
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:13.860]  Yeah, I also think it's risky for them not to try it
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:18.140]  and Samsung is obviously their biggest rival
[01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:20.620]  and it's in terms of quantity
[01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:22.780]  and in terms of, it's no mistake
[01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:24.820]  that that's where the Wall Street Journal's article
[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:27.580]  about who's taking the design crown from Apple
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:28.800]  is that it's Samsung.
[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:35.640]  I don't think that Apple can count on that though,
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:38.640]  can't count on Samsung not making a better leap,
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:41.620]  can't count on some other company making a dent.
[01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:45.460]  It would be foolish, the Pixel is a very nice phone.
[01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:48.460]  I've actually had it out in the last few days
[01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:51.640]  because I've been mostly on Twitter writing about,
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:53.680]  I don't know if we'll get to it on this show
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:57.060]  but changes to the iOS 11 notification center
[01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:59.760]  that I don't like compared to iOS 10
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:02.620]  and comparing it to the latest and greatest on Android
[01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:05.360]  where some, long been held by some people
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:06.880]  that Android has a better,
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.760]  whatever you think of Android versus iOS overall,
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:11.420]  that Android has a better notification UI
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:12.780]  which I kind of disagree with,
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:14.240]  especially compared to iOS 10
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:15.940]  but I'm not sure I disagree with it
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:16.780]  compared to iOS 11.
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:18.020]  They're both worse than webOS, we all know that.
[01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:20.140]  Yeah, that's true, it's absolutely true.
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:23.480]  I've been thinking about webOS and the Palm a lot too
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:28.480]  in this iPhone 10 year nostalgia.
[01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:33.100]  My God, my biggest regret is that Palm didn't make it
[01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:36.100]  or that somebody didn't, somebody like Microsoft,
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:38.340]  like instead of wasting all that money on Nokia,
[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:39.940]  what if they bought Palm instead
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:42.360]  and just thrown money at the hardware
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:46.380]  to get it to go fast enough to make that work?
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:49.400]  That's my deepest regret
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:53.840]  because man, that's the only other UI that I ever liked,
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.280]  really liked overall.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:58.960]  And in some ways I really did like it better
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:01.780]  than the iPhone OS.
[01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:03.140]  Anyway, that's a long digression.
[01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:04.900]  There's a lot of things right, yes.
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:06.920]  There were enough former Apple people at Palm
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:08.120]  that it made sense
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:11.780]  but the gist of my reaction,
[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:14.020]  my overall take to webOS was that webOS
[01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:18.500]  was a more Apple-y product historically.
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:21.680]  Like if you look at the heyday of the original Mac,
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:26.680]  like that 1985 through 1995, 96, the best of Apple design
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:31.000]  and the sort of thinking that made the Newton great
[01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:37.060]  and it really made the original when the classic Mac OS
[01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:39.620]  had the biggest advantage UI-wise over Windows
[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:40.780]  and everything else,
[01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:43.420]  that a lot of the sentiment that made it great then
[01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:45.940]  was in webOS and not in ways,
[01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:48.860]  not that iOS was bad in any of those ways
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:51.260]  but it was sort of like it overlooked some of it.
[01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:55.660]  Like the notification, the way that notifications in webOS
[01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:59.060]  were years ahead of iOS and very, very elegant,
[01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:01.140]  it's a different problem that's being solved
[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:04.780]  but it reminds me of the control strip in the classic Mac OS
[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:07.540]  which was still to me, every time I sit here and fiddle
[01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:09.100]  with these stupid little icons,
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:12.260]  like menu bar icons on Mac OS X,
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:16.380]  it just pains me to think of how nicely
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.100]  the classic Mac OS solved that problem
[01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:21.860]  of wanting to have persistent little icons
[01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:24.740]  for adjusting things without cluttering
[01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:27.140]  the freaking menu bar which should really be for menus
[01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:28.480]  but anyway, I digress.
[01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:30.780]  It's a good digression.
[01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:33.500]  It's a very good digression
[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:36.540]  but anyway, I've got the Pixel here and I've been using it.
[01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:39.900]  I hadn't used it for, I don't know,
[01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:41.660]  I could tell by some of my notifications,
[01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:43.420]  I hadn't used it for like 20 weeks.
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:46.480]  It's a nice phone.
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:47.300]  I gave mine to Serenity.
[01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:48.780]  She was just in town and she wanted to try it
[01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:50.780]  so mine is currently on loan to Serenity Caldwell.
[01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:51.740]  It's a nice phone.
[01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:54.140]  It's way better than any Android phone
[01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:55.320]  I've ever seen before
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.600]  and the combination of hardware and software,
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:59.940]  I still like way more than any Samsung phone.
[01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:04.300]  I just can't stand the Samsung UI Chrome
[01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:06.520]  that they insist on adding to their phones
[01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:09.140]  no matter how nice the S8 looks
[01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:12.140]  without thinking about the software.
[01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:15.420]  But it's, you know,
[01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:21.940]  I repeat myself but I cannot believe
[01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:24.620]  how much criticism the iPhone 7 got last year
[01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:29.620]  for looking quote unquote just like the iPhone 6 and 6S
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:34.180]  when the Google Pixel looks exactly like an iPhone 6.
[01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:35.300]  It got graded on a curve.
[01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:36.140]  Right.
[01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:39.740]  It's one of the greatest grading curves
[01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:41.100]  I've ever seen in my life.
[01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:42.380]  This was apparently a rush job.
[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:43.580]  They couldn't get the hardware they wanted
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:45.860]  so they just got HTC to put this together for them.
[01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:49.500]  Well, and it's particularly inexplicable in so far
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:53.060]  is that it has the exact same proportioned chin and forehead
[01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:55.380]  as the iPhone 7
[01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:59.380]  and, okay, uses the forehead for the same purposes
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:01.500]  as the iPhone to have a speaker grill
[01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:04.180]  and front-facing cameras and other sensors
[01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:08.100]  but then has the chin that literally has nothing.
[01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:08.940]  It doesn't have a-
[01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:09.780]  It's a pretty empty, barren chin.
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:12.540]  Has no button, has no sensor for your fingerprint,
[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:14.620]  has no soft buttons.
[01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:15.780]  Yeah.
[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:17.620]  So anyway, but you can't count-
[01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:19.500]  It's got antenna lines and an antenna window.
[01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:20.340]  It's very confusing.
[01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:22.580]  Look, Google has a ton of money
[01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:25.100]  and I don't think that they would do it
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:26.000]  what I'm about to say
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.700]  but you can't count them out strategically
[01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:33.700]  that they could come in and design a Pixel phone
[01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:36.220]  because they do have liberties with the Pixel line
[01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:38.380]  because they're not trying to sell 100 million of them.
[01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:40.480]  They know that Samsung is going to sell
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:41.540]  the most high-end phones
[01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:45.660]  and they know that the meaty middle of the Android market
[01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:47.900]  that makes up that chunk that gives them
[01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:50.220]  the overall market share value
[01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:52.700]  is cheap phones around the world,
[01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:54.120]  lower cost phones around the world
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:56.440]  from dozens of different little manufacturers.
[01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:58.500]  So they can do whatever they want with the Pixel brand
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:21:59.860]  and so I don't think strategically
[01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:01.300]  that Apple could count out the fact
[01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:05.320]  that they could build a Pixel super phone
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:07.500]  that Apple not couldn't beat
[01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:08.660]  because they couldn't do it
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:12.260]  but that they couldn't sell at 200 to 300 million of a year.
[01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:16.380]  Well, that's the rumors that the CFO at Google
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:17.460]  has taken over a lot of things
[01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:19.900]  which is why you see so many of the product managers
[01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:21.500]  just running for cover
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:24.900]  and not releasing a new chat client every three days anymore
[01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:27.300]  and one of the things she apparently wants is an iPhone
[01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:28.580]  and the rumor was this year,
[01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:31.660]  Pixel 2 would have the squeeze sides like the HTC 11
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:33.220]  where it doesn't have buttons anymore
[01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:35.300]  or there's a portless prototype apparently
[01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:36.860]  which is sort of where you hear Apple
[01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:37.700]  going in the future too.
[01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:38.620]  So it sounds very much like
[01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.380]  that's exactly what Google wants to do.
[01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:44.980]  Yeah, I just feel, so here's a tweet.
[01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:45.820]  Somebody tweeted us
[01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:47.840]  because you and I are sort of on the same page with this
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:49.560]  but somebody tweeted to us,
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:54.540]  I think you and Rene Ritchie, this is to me,
[01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:56.340]  are understating what a huge gamble
[01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:57.520]  this strategy would be.
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:00.660]  This strategy meaning Apple introducing a new super tier
[01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:04.980]  of post $1,000 iPhones that sell in smaller quantity.
[01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:09.540]  There's so much brand power in the new iPhone.
[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:11.860]  I totally get that.
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:16.440]  I totally get that that has been a huge part
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:17.420]  of the iPhone's success
[01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:18.580]  and it is part of the brand
[01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:20.220]  that every year you can get excited
[01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:22.280]  and there's going to be a new iPhone
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:24.700]  and you're gonna find out all about it in September
[01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:26.700]  and you'll be able to place a pre-order,
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:30.060]  what is it, three days later?
[01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:31.740]  Do they take the pre-orders?
[01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.580]  Yeah, it's usually the Friday right after the event.
[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:36.180]  Right, so they have like a Tuesday or Wednesday event
[01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:38.620]  and then on Friday you can place a pre-order
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:41.360]  and the pre-orders will ship in like two weeks
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:42.920]  or something or 10 days
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:46.580]  and then there's reviews come out like the next Wednesday
[01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:47.460]  or something like that
[01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:49.560]  from people who get seated with pre-release hardware
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:51.440]  and there's this whole formula we go through.
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:54.180]  Totally get it that that's part of the brand
[01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:55.020]  of the iPhone.
[01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:58.980]  But my big take is that it's risky.
[01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:01.060]  Yes, so it would be risky for them to do this
[01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:02.060]  because it would be a change
[01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:03.380]  and who knows how it's gonna go over
[01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:05.700]  and the disaster would be if they think,
[01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:08.800]  hey, we can only make 10 or 20 million of these super phones
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:10.380]  in this first quarter it goes on sale
[01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:12.900]  so no matter how popular it is, that's the most we'll get
[01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:16.500]  but if it really dampens demand for the other iPhones,
[01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:17.380]  that could be a problem
[01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:19.180]  and they'll sell fewer overall iPhones
[01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:23.180]  and worse, generate fewer, less revenue in profits.
[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:25.380]  Or if it alienates traditional customers
[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:27.380]  or they start looking elsewhere I think is the big risk.
[01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:31.020]  Right and I don't think that's a ridiculous idea to have.
[01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:32.100]  I think it's a huge,
[01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:34.700]  I think this is a huge product marketing challenge
[01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:39.180]  in every sense of the words product marketing
[01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:41.620]  in Apple's way where I've said this before
[01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:44.040]  and you know this probably even better than I do
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.780]  based on some of your sources at Apple
[01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:47.440]  but people think marketing
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:49.180]  and they think well marketers are the people
[01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:52.140]  who somebody goes out in a company and designs a product
[01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:55.340]  and they make a product and then at the end here it is
[01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:56.540]  and then they give it to marketing
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:57.980]  and they're like now sell this
[01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:00.340]  and then marketing makes a box for it
[01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:02.420]  and then comes up with an ad campaign
[01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:04.500]  and it goes out to the world
[01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:05.860]  and then that's marketing's job
[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:06.680]  and there might, you know,
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:08.540]  in some companies that is how marketing works.
[01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:10.420]  Marketing is told here's what we're gonna sell,
[01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:12.300]  you come up with a way to sell it.
[01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:15.860]  At Apple product marketing is involved
[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:19.580]  at every step of the way of the conception of a product
[01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:24.580]  and the design of the product and that the selling points
[01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:26.780]  aren't determined after it's given to them.
[01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:29.660]  The selling points are determined before it's even made.
[01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:32.460]  Yeah absolutely, I mean they sort of have a,
[01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:33.940]  what I love about Apple
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:35.580]  and I think it's one of their best qualities
[01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:36.820]  is both in hardware and software
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:39.020]  they have features that marketing really wants
[01:25:39.020 --> 01:25:40.540]  or someone like Johnny Ive really wants
[01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:42.020]  and I still laugh when people think Johnny Ive
[01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:42.940]  is not connected with Apple
[01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:45.220]  because all the stuff goes through him.
[01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:47.340]  It gets pitched in but there's things,
[01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:49.300]  some of the biggest things we've seen in recent years
[01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:51.180]  have been an engineer who came up with an idea
[01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:53.380]  and pitched it to Johnny or pitched it to Craig
[01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:54.620]  and then it goes through marketing
[01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:55.820]  and they figure out can we sell this,
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:57.220]  can this be a flagship feature
[01:25:57.220 --> 01:25:59.660]  and then everything in Apple lines up behind it.
[01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:04.340]  Right, and so this is a huge product marketing challenge
[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:08.140]  not in terms of starting, you know, a couple of weeks ago
[01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:10.380]  when they start coming up with ad campaigns
[01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:14.300]  for these phones but in terms of the years long conception
[01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:17.900]  of the phones that were slated for the end of 2017
[01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:20.580]  to come up with if you're going to switch
[01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:21.540]  to a new super tier,
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:26.540]  how do you keep the mass market tier still popular
[01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:28.460]  both in terms of how do you actually,
[01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:30.420]  you know, what features do you actually put in there
[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:33.340]  and then how do you position them in advertising
[01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:35.780]  and in a keynote and et cetera
[01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:37.660]  so that people want to buy it.
[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:39.540]  It's a huge challenge, absolutely.
[01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:42.020]  I think it's the hardest challenge Apple's ever done
[01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:43.820]  since the original iPhone.
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:44.660]  I really did.
[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:46.100]  And they've had little steps to prepare for this,
[01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:47.860]  like, you know, we're gonna make two phones this year
[01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:48.820]  which is different, you know,
[01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:50.460]  is that gonna have any problems with it?
[01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:52.020]  We're gonna make a less expensive iPhone.
[01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:54.340]  Are we gonna bring the average selling price down too much
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:56.860]  because people are gravitating towards the 5C more
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:26:58.420]  than they are towards the 5S.
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:01.060]  I mean, all of those were sort of practice for this
[01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:03.220]  but none of them had the risk associated with this.
[01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:05.100]  Right, the risk wasn't there.
[01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:07.820]  Like, worst case, like with the 6 Plus,
[01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:12.460]  let's say that they had by a factor of 2X underestimated
[01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:15.020]  just how many people wanted a 5.5 inch phone.
[01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:16.660]  It would have taken them a few quarters
[01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:19.060]  to get that fixed.
[01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:20.340]  But it wouldn't have sunk them
[01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:22.380]  because at least people would have been shifting
[01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:25.180]  towards the more expensive of the two models.
[01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:28.340]  And it would have been remediable for the next year
[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:31.320]  because the next year's phones, the 6S and 6S Plus,
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:32.820]  wouldn't have to be redesigned.
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:34.660]  They would just have to reappropriate
[01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:39.660]  which one's gonna be made in which quantities.
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:44.220]  Whereas if this new, if, and again,
[01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:46.060]  I could be wrong about all of this, who knows.
[01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:47.620]  I really do emphasize that.
[01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:52.420]  But if they're introducing a new higher tier iPhone X
[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:55.260]  with an OLED display, but even if they buy
[01:27:55.260 --> 01:27:58.140]  every single OLED display that meets their standards
[01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:01.460]  for what they need for this thing to look good,
[01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:03.780]  in a world that they can only make, say,
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:07.020]  15 million of them in the first quarter,
[01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:09.980]  if the mere existence of that phone
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:13.380]  means people buy fewer other phones,
[01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:16.340]  even if they're lined up to buy it in later quarters,
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:18.980]  but backordered by three months.
[01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:20.940]  That's a problem for Apple financially.
[01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:23.260]  Yeah, and we saw the reverse of that
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:27.460]  when people, sort of iPhone 6 pulled upgrade cycles forward
[01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:28.740]  and people were super happy with it,
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:31.540]  but then they paid for that in the 6S quarter.
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:32.700]  And those things are very,
[01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:34.220]  the consistency of that is important.
[01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:35.900]  Right, so I totally, and I think you agree,
[01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:38.420]  but I totally agree it's a risky strategy.
[01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:42.660]  But I also think it is risky to maintain the status quo
[01:28:42.660 --> 01:28:45.140]  where all new iPhones must be producible
[01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:47.860]  at 200 to 300 million units per year
[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:50.900]  for roughly 650 to $950.
[01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:56.860]  To both not be able to take advantage of components
[01:28:56.860 --> 01:29:00.540]  that may not be available in hundreds of millions per year,
[01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:02.260]  but only tens of millions per year
[01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:06.900]  means that they're ceding any of those type of features
[01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:09.940]  to companies that are willing to make high-end phones
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:11.660]  in smaller quantities.
[01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:16.660]  And by not testing the post above $1,000 prices,
[01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:21.820]  price points, they're ceding the opportunity
[01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:25.300]  to create phones like that to other companies.
[01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:27.780]  Yeah, and you were right earlier when you said
[01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:30.380]  that iPad Pro, people think about it differently than iPad,
[01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:32.740]  and MacBook Pro, people don't think MacBook Pro
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:36.020]  is an elitist thing because I can only afford a MacBook.
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:37.420]  But I was joking on Twitter,
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:38.940]  and I kind of regret this in hindsight
[01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:39.980]  because it doesn't feel very Canadian,
[01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:41.900]  but I was joking that this is the company
[01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:44.420]  that replaced the iPod Mini with the iPod Nano,
[01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:46.020]  and they take risks to grow.
[01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:47.540]  Otherwise, you put on your blinders
[01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:49.820]  and you end up owning a basketball team.
[01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:50.780]  And I think that's really true
[01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:52.620]  because Microsoft was the classic example
[01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.460]  of never being able to look beyond Windows.
[01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:56.980]  And you can milk every cent of profit that you want
[01:29:56.980 --> 01:29:58.220]  out of an existing product,
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:29:59.620]  but unless you're willing to take that gamble
[01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:01.300]  on what's next or what's more,
[01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:02.860]  that product will eventually hit too low
[01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:03.980]  for you to salvage.
[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:08.980]  All right, it is not Canadian of you,
[01:30:08.980 --> 01:30:11.820]  but it is what happened.
[01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:18.020]  And one of the points I made,
[01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:21.060]  and again, and part of it may be fueled by the,
[01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:26.060]  and again, I'm anti-ten-year anniversary mania.
[01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:29.780]  Again, is Apple not going to even mention that
[01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:31.860]  it's been 10 years in the next keynote?
[01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:33.900]  No, I guess they'll probably mention it.
[01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:35.660]  But I do not, I think it's the sort of thing
[01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:37.300]  that they might mention in the keynote.
[01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:39.420]  I absolutely do not think that they're going
[01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:42.020]  to build an ad campaign around these phones
[01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:44.940]  being quote, 10-year anniversary iPhones.
[01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:46.620]  And in fact, even if they do, I mean,
[01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:48.100]  maybe they'll surprise me and I'll judge,
[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:50.700]  again, like you said, let's judge them once they come out
[01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:51.780]  and I pre-judge them.
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:53.220]  I'll judge the ads when they come out
[01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:55.980]  and maybe there's a way to do it that I would find,
[01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:57.660]  wow, that is actually pretty good.
[01:30:58.860 --> 01:31:01.340]  I tend to think an ad campaign based on this
[01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:02.980]  being the 10th anniversary of the iPhone
[01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:05.540]  is a who gives a shit thing.
[01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:09.260]  Nobody in the real world, 300 million people
[01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:11.700]  buying iPhones don't give a shit if it's the ninth year
[01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:13.980]  or 10th year or the 11th year.
[01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:14.820]  They just don't.
[01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:16.220]  And I think it's really informative,
[01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:17.420]  and I don't know if you got this vibe too,
[01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:19.540]  but when we looked at the 10-year celebrations,
[01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:21.860]  it was former Apple people who were celebrating.
[01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:24.860]  People inside Apple, it wasn't like the Macintosh
[01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:26.540]  anniversary where the signatures of everybody
[01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:27.380]  were suddenly on the wall.
[01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:29.140]  It really feels like Apple is not making
[01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:30.140]  a big deal out of this.
[01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:32.700]  Right, and it's like the difference between strategy
[01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:35.220]  and tactics, like it certainly is a tactic
[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:36.460]  to have a campaign this year,
[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:38.180]  but it's a terrible long-term strategy
[01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:39.540]  because then what happens next year
[01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:42.140]  when it's the 11th year, which isn't a nice round number
[01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:44.700]  for a species that happens to have been born
[01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:47.620]  with five fingers on each hand?
[01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:51.780]  Do you know what I mean?
[01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:54.980]  If we'd been born with four fingers on each hand,
[01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:58.460]  we would have been celebrating this two years ago.
[01:31:58.460 --> 01:32:00.140]  And they didn't make a big deal out of iOS 10.
[01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:02.420]  I mean, it's just they shipped it
[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:03.620]  and then they got on with iOS 11.
[01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:04.940]  Right, I don't know.
[01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:07.860]  So I don't wanna go on a long rant about this,
[01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:11.100]  but I don't know, just deeply suspicious
[01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:12.580]  that 10th year anniversary.
[01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:14.300]  Again, they might mention it in the keynote
[01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:15.700]  and do a thing where they run through
[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:18.620]  and show us pictures of every single iPhone up until now
[01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:20.180]  and then use that as a way to say,
[01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:22.580]  and now we've got something even more exciting to show you.
[01:32:22.580 --> 01:32:23.780]  But that's a keynote.
[01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:25.340]  That's a way of framing something in a keynote.
[01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:28.020]  It's not an ad campaign and certainly not a market.
[01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:30.060]  It's not like the 10th anniversary Mac.
[01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:32.140]  They can take an iPad, stick an iPhone form.
[01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:33.500]  Right, and in fact,
[01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:36.580]  and that's another thing I'd like to shoot down
[01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:39.100]  is the idea that this OLED,
[01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:43.380]  just doing two phones at once and having an OLED model
[01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:45.700]  that might be more expensive and more exclusive
[01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:48.100]  would be a one-off, one-time thing
[01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:50.460]  just to celebrate the iPhone 10th anniversary.
[01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:53.700]  That to me would be a canary in the virtual coal mine
[01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:56.100]  of wow, sell your Apple stock there.
[01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:58.180]  They really have lost their goddamn minds
[01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:02.900]  because that is absolutely horrible strategically.
[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:06.060]  Again, it's a tactic where at one point and one time
[01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:08.300]  they might rally up a bunch of their best fans
[01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:09.420]  to have them buy this phone,
[01:33:09.420 --> 01:33:12.540]  but it's not a strategy that they can use
[01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:16.260]  as they evolve year after year after year.
[01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:21.260]  It's putting a bunch of arrows in one shot.
[01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:23.500]  And it's not even that dissimilar
[01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:24.460]  because right now today,
[01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:26.180]  I can buy the best iPhone in the world,
[01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:28.660]  but for 100 bucks less, I can buy last year's iPhone.
[01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:30.700]  And this will be sort of a riff on that
[01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:33.700]  where I can buy the mainstream iPhone for 100 bucks less
[01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:36.700]  I can buy last year's 100 bucks more, I can buy next year's.
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:37.540]  Right, I love that.
[01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:39.020]  Or whatever the 100 bucks more is.
[01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:42.020]  I love that framing of that it's not so much
[01:33:42.020 --> 01:33:44.340]  about raising the price of the best iPhone,
[01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:49.340]  but more like making it possible to spend more
[01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:53.900]  to get a 2019 iPhone today.
[01:33:53.900 --> 01:33:56.100]  Yeah, which was the MacBook thing.
[01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:57.860]  Like the MacBook was literally technologies
[01:33:57.860 --> 01:33:59.100]  that were too expensive for them to sell
[01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:04.100]  at the $999 MacBook Air pricing.
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:05.980]  The screens were incredibly advanced.
[01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:07.980]  All the technology, the tiered batteries,
[01:34:07.980 --> 01:34:09.460]  they could not make it for much less.
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:10.980]  So they made it as well.
[01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:11.900]  We're putting this on the market.
[01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:13.860]  It's for a very specific sort of customers.
[01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:16.180]  And you don't have to get angry if it's not for you,
[01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:18.180]  but for people who do want it, they can pay and get it.
[01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:20.260]  Right, and we can actually measure how many years ahead
[01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:23.900]  it is by how long it takes for a just plain MacBook
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:26.620]  to be sold for $999.
[01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:28.940]  I mean, the MacBook Pro just got that display this year
[01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:30.500]  or I guess at the end of last year.
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:33.140]  That's how long it took to get that display technology
[01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:35.540]  into the more mainstream computer.
[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:40.460]  Right, and that brings me to my suggested name, iPhone Pro,
[01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:44.900]  which I stick to for a couple of reasons, which is one,
[01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:47.420]  and I've mentioned this before, Apple uses the word pro
[01:34:47.420 --> 01:34:50.460]  to mean something, sometimes it does mean professional.
[01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:52.540]  Like in the Mac Pro is a perfect example
[01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:54.760]  where there's really no reason for anybody
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:57.700]  to have ever bought any computer called the Mac Pro
[01:34:57.700 --> 01:35:00.260]  for anything other than professional purposes
[01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:01.100]  that I can think of.
[01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:02.460]  I can't think of any reason.
[01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:09.900]  MacBook Pros though, for example, and even iPad Pros
[01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:11.940]  aren't necessarily about professional uses.
[01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:16.580]  Like in Apple's terms, pro is just a way of denoting deluxe
[01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:20.060]  or, you know, but plus in the iPhone sense,
[01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:21.460]  at first just meant bigger.
[01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:24.440]  Now it's a little bit more because it's iPhone with more
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:25.620]  because the camera does more,
[01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:27.700]  even though the first two models did have optical image
[01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:30.740]  stabilization, but that's a much, much smaller
[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:34.380]  photographic advantage than this dual camera system.
[01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:37.460]  It was like, they were like, it's the same
[01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:39.220]  as the other phone, but just a little bit bigger
[01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:41.060]  and has a slightly more-
[01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:42.160]  It's a plus size model.
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:46.500]  Right, and it was almost like an asterisk point
[01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:48.340]  and it has optical image stabilization,
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:51.460]  which is kind of nice, but in a lot of circumstances
[01:35:51.460 --> 01:35:52.420]  you're not even gonna notice it,
[01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:53.260]  whereas the dual camera thing is-
[01:35:53.260 --> 01:35:54.340]  Bigger battery and yeah.
[01:35:54.340 --> 01:35:56.500]  Right, the dual camera thing is like, you know,
[01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:57.940]  you put your phone into portrait mode
[01:35:57.940 --> 01:35:59.060]  and you don't notice the difference,
[01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:01.500]  then, you know, you've got some problems.
[01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:02.320]  Yeah.
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:03.420]  Yes.
[01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:05.780]  It, you know, pro means something different.
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:09.980]  And I think that calling such a phone the iPhone Pro
[01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:12.580]  actually works both ways, where it's,
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:14.100]  in one way it means deluxe.
[01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:15.700]  It means, yes, this costs more.
[01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:19.500]  And it's, you know, it's not for everybody.
[01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:22.980]  It's not the mass market, the default model.
[01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:26.620]  It's not meant to be the best-selling model by quantity.
[01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:28.960]  But I also think it works in the context
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:30.960]  of this is a tool for professionals,
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:33.140]  because I think the thing, one of the things,
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:35.920]  again, I'm not making this in a marketing sense,
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:37.800]  but just in a nostalgic sense of looking back
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:40.100]  at this 10th anniversary of the iPhone,
[01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:44.460]  of the role of what, and then even the meaning
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:47.620]  of the word phone has changed so much in the last 10 years
[01:36:47.620 --> 01:36:53.100]  because of the iPhone that it would have been ridiculous
[01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:57.500]  10 years ago for someone to say their most important
[01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:02.180]  professional tool was their cell phone in a computing sense.
[01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:03.980]  There certainly were people like,
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:05.620]  maybe like a real estate agent or somebody
[01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:10.580]  whose job is to be on the telephone making phone calls
[01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:12.620]  all day long who would say their phone
[01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:15.500]  is their most important professional tool, you know.
[01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:19.220]  But nobody thinks of the iPhone as changing the world
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:21.820]  in terms of how long you spend on the phone calls.
[01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:23.180]  In fact, I think most of us would think
[01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:26.400]  that one of the great advantages of the post-iPhone world
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:28.220]  is that we get fewer phone calls per day
[01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:29.940]  because things that used to be phone calls
[01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:32.660]  now come as text messages and iMessages, et cetera.
[01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:35.580]  And we can deal with companies.
[01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:38.140]  And if you have a customer service product
[01:37:38.140 --> 01:37:40.460]  with a company that you can just go to their app
[01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:42.980]  and deal with, oh my God, I gotta send this thing back.
[01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:45.340]  Let me send it, instead of waiting on hold, right?
[01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:47.900]  Like in a lot of ways, the post-iPhone world
[01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:48.900]  is about spending less time
[01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:51.540]  on the goddamn phone call than not.
[01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:53.100]  So forget about phone calls.
[01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:55.200]  But I mean, in a computing sense,
[01:37:56.140 --> 01:37:57.500]  I know tons of people firsthand
[01:37:57.500 --> 01:38:00.260]  whose most important tool is their iPhone.
[01:38:01.540 --> 01:38:04.380]  Or whatever phone they use, whatever phone they use.
[01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:07.860]  So why not make a pro model for people
[01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:10.260]  who can take advantage of, I don't know,
[01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:14.420]  better battery life or better screen or,
[01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:16.020]  I don't know what features are in it.
[01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:17.300]  A bigger screen and a smaller,
[01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:19.020]  that would be huge for just a lot of people
[01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:20.460]  who do find the big phone too big
[01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:22.180]  to do their one-handed typing and all their work
[01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:23.020]  and the stuff that they wanna do
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:24.180]  but still need a big display.
[01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:26.900]  I mean, that itself is, people will pay,
[01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:30.300]  that's the thing, people will pay for the MacBook
[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:32.020]  even though the price to performance ratio
[01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:33.400]  is nowhere near what a MacBook Pro is,
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:35.240]  even though they're at roughly the same price.
[01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:37.860]  Will people pay for a phone that has,
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:39.440]  this is more portable, it's more mobile,
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:40.780]  it's miniaturized, it's got this better screen,
[01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:41.900]  it's easier to use in one hand,
[01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:43.280]  it's got these better features.
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:45.180]  Right, and that's a perfect example.
[01:38:45.180 --> 01:38:47.860]  The MacBook Pro, 13-inch MacBook Pro,
[01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:51.140]  by far the most popular pro model for MacBooks.
[01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:53.740]  Why would you buy that instead of buying
[01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:57.000]  a MacBook Air or a MacBook?
[01:38:59.860 --> 01:39:01.500]  For some people, it's professional context,
[01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:03.260]  like the fact that you have, it's bigger,
[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:05.340]  it has better battery life or it's faster
[01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:09.140]  and you do things, you do so much on it, whatever.
[01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:13.340]  I can think of other truly professional contexts.
[01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:15.100]  More and more people, I see it, and again,
[01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:16.860]  I'm not saying most professional photographers
[01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:19.220]  shoot their stuff on their cell phone,
[01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:22.860]  but they can, and photographs get used
[01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:26.420]  in a professional context, so if just for example,
[01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:30.580]  like the iPhone, the new regular 4.7 and 5.5-inch phones
[01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:33.980]  get new cameras, maybe the 4.7-inch
[01:39:33.980 --> 01:39:35.740]  gets the dual-camera design too.
[01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:39.420]  It's tended to trail the Plus model by one year
[01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:42.380]  in terms of the video image stabilization
[01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:45.460]  came to the 6S, didn't it, I think?
[01:39:45.460 --> 01:39:46.300]  I don't know.
[01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:47.140]  But the 7.
[01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:48.580]  Yeah, the biggest concern is the space inside that.
[01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:53.100]  Right, the 7 though does have optical image stabilization,
[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:55.620]  which was previously only in the Plus models,
[01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:58.340]  and so it might make, just in terms of following
[01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:00.580]  previous examples, I wouldn't be surprised
[01:40:00.580 --> 01:40:04.740]  if the new 4.7-inch regular, quote-unquote regular iPhone
[01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:10.540]  has dual cameras that are pretty much like last year's 7 Plus.
[01:40:10.540 --> 01:40:13.100]  So let's just say those phones get camera improvements
[01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:14.900]  along the lines of what we'd expect,
[01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:17.580]  we have expected for years in the year-to-year camera
[01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:20.980]  improvements in new iPhones, but maybe the iPhone Pro
[01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:24.020]  gets an even better camera that actually costs significant,
[01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:28.140]  you know, costs Apple, you know, $30 or $40 more per component.
[01:40:28.140 --> 01:40:29.780]  It has those sensors that you were talking
[01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:30.780]  about a couple of years ago.
[01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:32.580]  Exactly, right.
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:33.340]  What were those?
[01:40:33.340 --> 01:40:38.220]  They were like, yeah, exactly, the PrimeSense sensors
[01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:39.020]  that cost more.
[01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:41.140]  Maybe it's not even an issue of the quantity
[01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:44.620]  that they can be made of, but the simple fact that they're
[01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:50.460]  $50 components that, say, in a phone where it's typical,
[01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:54.740]  you know, Apple's used to having a $15 component in there.
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:55.620]  It makes a difference.
[01:40:55.620 --> 01:40:57.940]  And for a true professional, in a professional context,
[01:40:57.940 --> 01:40:59.100]  that might make a difference.
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:00.900]  It might be, would you pay for it?
[01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:04.420]  No questions, you know, no questions, no blinking.
[01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:06.660]  And considering what people pay for cameras,
[01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:09.180]  you know, regular good cameras, you know,
[01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:12.540]  an extra $200 premium over the other iPhones
[01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:16.100]  is actually a bargain if you're used to spending, you know,
[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:19.380]  $500 to $1,000 or more on a camera, like a pocket.
[01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:21.340]  The hilarious thing about all of this
[01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:22.900]  is that what humans will pay for it.
[01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:25.100]  We've seen this in gaming, where people won't pay $10
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:27.380]  for a great game, but they'll pay $100
[01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:30.300]  to have a better-looking farm or to get on the racetrack faster,
[01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:32.820]  like if it's ego gratification or instinct gratification,
[01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:33.540]  will pay for it.
[01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:35.940]  And I can't help but think that if Apple made exactly
[01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:38.220]  the same phone, like they did with Apple Watch,
[01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:41.140]  if they made iPhone 7S, and then the iPhone X was just
[01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:43.980]  that with ceramics, no difference, as a fashion thing,
[01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:46.300]  we'd have zero problem paying the price difference.
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:48.220]  It's when the feature parity changes.
[01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:50.540]  And Georgia Dow, my colleague, she had this great video
[01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:53.060]  that she showed me where you have these two monkeys in a cage
[01:41:53.060 --> 01:41:56.100]  and both monkeys are being given cucumber.
[01:41:56.100 --> 01:41:57.740]  And they're both completely fine.
[01:41:57.740 --> 01:41:59.660]  But when one monkey is given something better,
[01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:01.540]  and I forget if it was chocolate or something,
[01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:04.260]  not only does the other monkey feel jealous,
[01:42:04.260 --> 01:42:06.660]  but he gets angry and starts throwing his cucumber
[01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:07.660]  at the feeder.
[01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:08.700]  He's irate.
[01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:10.620]  And he would rather have nothing than have
[01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:13.580]  something that is worse than somebody else has.
[01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:14.900]  It could, you know.
[01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:16.900]  In some ways, I get it.
[01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:20.740]  You know, and we're all just bald monkeys, really.
[01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:25.260]  I get it.
[01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:35.820]  But I think back to the iBook G3.
[01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:41.620]  I forget if, I think it was a G3 that I bought in around 2002
[01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:42.540]  or so, I think.
[01:42:42.540 --> 01:42:44.340]  2001, 2002.
[01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:48.420]  I bought an 11-inch white iBook.
[01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:50.660]  It was back when they had the clear keys,
[01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:53.900]  which were kind of gross.
[01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:57.420]  And my main computer at home was when I first,
[01:42:57.420 --> 01:43:02.500]  it was like when I was, after I left Barebone Software
[01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:04.580]  and I was going to work for myself for a while doing
[01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:07.860]  freelance web development and other work.
[01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:11.580]  And my main work machine was a Power Mac 9600
[01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:13.740]  from a while back, which I had bought for, I don't know,
[01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:15.820]  how many thousands of dollars, and which was still
[01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:17.420]  a super, super fast machine.
[01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:21.340]  And I'd upgraded some stuff and ran Mac OS 9.
[01:43:21.340 --> 01:43:22.100]  I felt super fast.
[01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:24.220]  But I wanted a machine, I needed to own a machine
[01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:27.580]  that I could run Mac OS 10 on.
[01:43:27.580 --> 01:43:30.580]  Just so I could, I wanted, I needed two machines for it.
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:33.060]  My 9600 couldn't run OS 10.
[01:43:33.060 --> 01:43:37.220]  And I didn't want to replace it with a high end
[01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:38.340]  thing that could dual boot.
[01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:40.220]  I actually wanted both running at the same time,
[01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:41.300]  long story short.
[01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:43.620]  And at the time, I just could not justify the price
[01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:46.100]  of buying the Power Mac G4.
[01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:46.900]  12 inch?
[01:43:46.900 --> 01:43:47.660]  Remember that?
[01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:48.500]  I know you remember.
[01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:51.780]  It was the one where the keyboard went edge to edge.
[01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:53.740]  And to me, still to this day, is one
[01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:56.540]  of the most beautiful machines Apple's ever made.
[01:43:56.540 --> 01:43:58.020]  I've said this before on the show.
[01:43:58.020 --> 01:44:01.260]  I remember just several years ago, just like 10 years
[01:44:01.260 --> 01:44:03.700]  after it came out, like 2012, I was in a coffee shop
[01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:05.380]  and I saw somebody with one.
[01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:08.020]  But it took my breath away because I thought maybe I was,
[01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:10.420]  even here in Philadelphia, I thought,
[01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:14.340]  some Apple employee here using a prototype MacBook.
[01:44:14.340 --> 01:44:15.900]  No, it's absolute classic.
[01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:19.020]  And it wasn't until I recognized what it was,
[01:44:19.020 --> 01:44:21.540]  it was when I recognized how thick it was, that I was like,
[01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:24.420]  oh, it was the thickness of the device.
[01:44:24.420 --> 01:44:28.540]  But just looking at the screen and the edge to edge keyboard,
[01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:30.700]  the edge to edge keyboard is sort of like those infinity
[01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:32.980]  pools.
[01:44:32.980 --> 01:44:34.420]  Beautiful machine.
[01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:36.300]  Almost the exact same footprint as the iBook
[01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:41.580]  that I bought, faster, but just so much less.
[01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:45.140]  But I couldn't justify it at the time.
[01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:47.700]  For what I wanted to use it for and for how much money I had,
[01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:48.860]  I just couldn't justify it.
[01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:50.580]  But it didn't make me angry at the people
[01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:54.100]  who had my iBook G3, which I didn't like as much
[01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:56.500]  as I would have loved the G4.
[01:44:56.500 --> 01:45:00.060]  It didn't make me angry at people who had the G4.
[01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:02.340]  The closest I came was the plastic MacBook
[01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:05.020]  when it was $100 more for black, and I just didn't justify it.
[01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:06.020]  I couldn't justify buying it.
[01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:07.540]  But every time I saw someone with a black one,
[01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:08.420]  I got a little angry.
[01:45:11.580 --> 01:45:14.620]  Especially because I don't think Apple had, at the time,
[01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:17.020]  it wasn't just whether you liked black or white better.
[01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:19.180]  The black wore better.
[01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:20.820]  Apple's whites, at the time, would
[01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:23.380]  tend to get a little grungy over time.
[01:45:23.380 --> 01:45:26.340]  Yes, I didn't know when I bought it.
[01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:28.140]  Yeah, I didn't buy either of those machines.
[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:30.820]  I think my wife had the white one, though, of that vintage.
[01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:32.860]  And I think she got, but she preferred white.
[01:45:32.860 --> 01:45:34.340]  She wanted the white one.
[01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:36.940]  But I remember people were mad about that one,
[01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:39.060]  because people wanted the black, and Apple was charging.
[01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:41.020]  And the only advantage was that it was black.
[01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:44.100]  It was just literally $100 for the color.
[01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:46.540]  So like you said, it is funny what people will pay for
[01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:49.140]  and what people will get angry about.
[01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:50.580]  Absolutely.
[01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:51.500]  So who knows?
[01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:53.380]  And this is what podcasting is for,
[01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:56.580]  is talking about things that are ephemeral.
[01:45:56.580 --> 01:45:58.820]  Because this whole discussion could
[01:45:58.820 --> 01:46:03.020]  be mute by what Apple actually announces come September.
[01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:05.820]  But I don't know.
[01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:06.940]  Then it'll be what it is.
[01:46:06.940 --> 01:46:08.180]  There'll be nothing to talk about.
[01:46:08.180 --> 01:46:09.420]  We can talk about whether we like it or not.
[01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:11.060]  But now, before they announce anything,
[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:14.180]  it's what I think you do so well, which is just trying
[01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:15.180]  to understand Apple.
[01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:18.820]  And then I think a lot of people attribute to sources
[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:20.780]  what is really Apple's a logical company.
[01:46:20.780 --> 01:46:22.340]  And if you start to understand Apple,
[01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:25.140]  you can start to sort of see not exactly the path forward,
[01:46:25.140 --> 01:46:26.900]  but where they might go going forward.
[01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:27.500]  Yeah.
[01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:29.260]  All right, let me take one last break here
[01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:31.180]  and thank our third and final sponsor,
[01:46:31.180 --> 01:46:33.900]  good friends of the show, Audible.
[01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:36.780]  Audible has an unmatched selection
[01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:42.780]  of audio books and original audio shows, news, comedy,
[01:46:42.780 --> 01:46:43.340]  and more.
[01:46:43.340 --> 01:46:47.060]  You can get a free 30-day trial at audible.com slash talk show.
[01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:50.420]  If you want to listen to it, Audible has it.
[01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:52.580]  Listen to audio books from virtually every genre,
[01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:53.780]  anytime, anywhere.
[01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:56.100]  You can play Audible's audio books
[01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:58.500]  on phones, tablets, computers, most Kindles, even iPods.
[01:46:58.500 --> 01:46:59.540]  Anything that you think you might
[01:46:59.540 --> 01:47:01.420]  be able to play Audible stuff on or that you
[01:47:01.420 --> 01:47:03.140]  ought to be able to, you can do it.
[01:47:03.140 --> 01:47:04.540]  It's great for long flights.
[01:47:04.540 --> 01:47:05.660]  It's great for road trips.
[01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:08.860]  Great for people like you, listener of the talk show,
[01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:11.180]  who are currently, right now, if you hear me saying
[01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:16.980]  this sentence, are obviously a consumer of Audible content.
[01:47:16.980 --> 01:47:17.500]  Guess what?
[01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:23.660]  If you've got time to fill in your audio listening schedule,
[01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:27.580]  Audible is where you can go to fill it up.
[01:47:27.580 --> 01:47:28.700]  Absolutely great.
[01:47:28.700 --> 01:47:30.220]  Audio books are probably more popular
[01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:31.580]  than they ever have been before.
[01:47:31.580 --> 01:47:33.500]  It seems to me, as I look at them,
[01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:36.300]  whenever I look to see what's going on,
[01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:38.380]  bestsellers or recent books that I've heard of
[01:47:38.380 --> 01:47:43.820]  are coming out on audio books more recently or more quickly.
[01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:46.780]  It's treated as a first-class target
[01:47:46.780 --> 01:47:48.660]  for best-selling books.
[01:47:48.660 --> 01:47:50.740]  A lot of them these days are read by the authors
[01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:52.900]  themselves, which is just great.
[01:47:52.900 --> 01:47:57.740]  It just somehow, it depends on the author, I'm sure.
[01:47:57.740 --> 01:48:00.300]  But when it works, it works unbelievably well,
[01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:02.500]  because you really get the cadence and punctuation
[01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:06.380]  of the sentences right from the person who wrote them.
[01:48:06.380 --> 01:48:07.980]  When you begin your free 30-day trial,
[01:48:07.980 --> 01:48:10.060]  you get your first audio book for free.
[01:48:10.060 --> 01:48:11.700]  And then there's no stress or obligation.
[01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:15.300]  And you can cancel your membership at any time.
[01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:18.540]  So anyway, if you want more to listen to, that's great.
[01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:20.100]  And you want to do it with no risk,
[01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:23.300]  go to audible.com slash talk show, know the,
[01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:25.140]  and they will know where you sent them.
[01:48:25.140 --> 01:48:28.820]  My thanks to them for their continued support of this show.
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:30.420]  All right, let me toss this out at you.
[01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:33.580]  Here's a company that I think made a terrible mistake,
[01:48:33.580 --> 01:48:37.180]  Andy Rubin's Essential.
[01:48:37.180 --> 01:48:39.420]  So Essential is Andy Rubin's new company.
[01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:43.500]  They've de-cloaked right before the, what's that conference,
[01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:45.100]  Recodes Conference.
[01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:48.500]  And they revealed a phone with a very nice-looking phone,
[01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:51.860]  for the most part, with an edge-to-edge design,
[01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:54.700]  top and bottom, a very weird.
[01:48:54.700 --> 01:48:57.020]  Not dissimilar to the iPhone rumors.
[01:48:57.020 --> 01:48:59.380]  Not dissimilar at all, although they've
[01:48:59.380 --> 01:49:02.660]  got like a weird little black Dracula
[01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:05.100]  thing over the front-facing camera
[01:49:05.100 --> 01:49:09.660]  in the center of the phone, which I understand
[01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:12.500]  why they couldn't technically put a,
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:14.060]  they needed a front-facing camera.
[01:49:14.060 --> 01:49:15.620]  And the front-facing camera couldn't
[01:49:15.620 --> 01:49:18.740]  go underneath the display.
[01:49:18.740 --> 01:49:20.940]  But I think that design-wise, they
[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:23.660]  should have done something else to accommodate that.
[01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:28.100]  Some of the rumors of the Apple edge-to-edge thing
[01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:33.380]  have a sort of, not quite as pointy as the Essential one.
[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:35.060]  Like an island in the sea of the phone.
[01:49:35.060 --> 01:49:37.940]  Yeah, and there's some kind of isthmus coming down there.
[01:49:37.940 --> 01:49:40.420]  But I think people's speculation in the mock-ups
[01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:47.060]  is that Apple would fill in the area to make a bar.
[01:49:47.060 --> 01:49:48.900]  They could fill it in with black.
[01:49:48.900 --> 01:49:51.700]  And on OLED, black is truly black.
[01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:54.260]  And so it really would be seamless visually.
[01:49:54.260 --> 01:49:58.820]  And you could just have things like the signal strength
[01:49:58.820 --> 01:50:01.020]  indicators and the battery strength indicator
[01:50:01.020 --> 01:50:04.180]  up there as white on black, and have
[01:50:04.180 --> 01:50:06.420]  it look like it's just magically part
[01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:08.700]  of the forehead of the phone.
[01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:11.500]  And you wouldn't really think of that as being the display.
[01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:13.580]  But that aside, it's a pretty nice-looking phone.
[01:50:13.580 --> 01:50:19.100]  And it's obviously meant to be sort of like Reuben's take
[01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:20.900]  on what the Pixel should be, I guess.
[01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:25.180]  Like, here's what a high-end, low-volume Android phone
[01:50:25.180 --> 01:50:25.820]  can be.
[01:50:25.820 --> 01:50:28.540]  And it's like shatterproof or something, his claim is.
[01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:32.220]  I think the mistake that they made,
[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:33.900]  because I think it sells.
[01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:36.820]  Obviously, they were promising a June delivery date.
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:39.260]  And we're recording in mid-July.
[01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:40.220]  And it's not out yet.
[01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:43.140]  So they've obviously run into some problems.
[01:50:43.140 --> 01:50:44.860]  But I think the mistake they made
[01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:47.940]  is that the thing sells for like $900 and some dollars.
[01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:50.060]  I think that they should have made, I swear to God,
[01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:53.020]  I think they should have made like a $2,000 phone,
[01:50:53.020 --> 01:50:57.740]  or at least like a $1,500 phone, and put more in it.
[01:50:57.740 --> 01:50:58.700]  Do more.
[01:50:58.700 --> 01:50:59.980]  Do more with the materials.
[01:50:59.980 --> 01:51:02.340]  Do more with the thing.
[01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:06.740]  And make a phone that, for Android enthusiasts,
[01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:11.780]  or people who are, what would you call it, bilingual,
[01:51:11.780 --> 01:51:17.980]  and enthusiasts who can jump or do jump between iOS and Android
[01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:20.340]  devices, something that they can hold up and say, wow,
[01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:26.500]  this is unabashedly higher quality than the iPhone.
[01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:28.460]  Yeah, sort of a status symbol.
[01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:32.300]  Right, I feel like part of the problem with the Pixel
[01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:34.540]  is that the Pixel, at least up in,
[01:51:34.540 --> 01:51:37.180]  I'm not judging the upcoming new one based on rumors,
[01:51:37.180 --> 01:51:38.900]  but the one that I have in my hand,
[01:51:38.900 --> 01:51:42.900]  is that their target was just the iPhone 6s.
[01:51:42.900 --> 01:51:44.380]  It was, let's make a phone.
[01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:45.180]  Let's do our best.
[01:51:45.180 --> 01:51:49.180]  And they came close, arguably close enough even.
[01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:51.420]  But that's not good enough if you're
[01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:54.940]  trying to overcome a deficit in terms
[01:51:54.940 --> 01:51:56.860]  of how you're perceived as and which is really
[01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:59.100]  the better premium product.
[01:51:59.100 --> 01:52:01.260]  And I think they could take advantage
[01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:02.740]  in that they've missed it.
[01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:06.660]  They've missed their opportunity to take advantage of the fact
[01:52:06.660 --> 01:52:10.100]  that Apple is hamstrung by what they can do by the price
[01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:12.180]  points of the iPhone.
[01:52:12.180 --> 01:52:14.660]  I wasn't sure when he announced it if this was a bid to be.
[01:52:14.660 --> 01:52:17.300]  You know how, I forget the guy's name is Nguyen or something.
[01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:19.420]  He keeps selling his company to Apple over and over again.
[01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:20.100]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:21.060]  I was just wondering.
[01:52:21.060 --> 01:52:23.020]  I was just like, he sold color, and he sold Lala,
[01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:23.820]  and all these things.
[01:52:23.820 --> 01:52:25.740]  I was wondering if this was Andy Rubin's sort of take on that
[01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:27.240]  where he sold Android, and now he's
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:29.700]  going to sell Essential because, again, they really
[01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:30.540]  want an iPhone.
[01:52:30.540 --> 01:52:32.940]  And if he can make something that Google finds compelling.
[01:52:32.940 --> 01:52:35.500]  But he just didn't seem to have carrier relationships.
[01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:37.700]  As poor as some of the carrier relationships,
[01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:39.980]  like Blackberry used to have great ones and now they're
[01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:40.460]  struggling.
[01:52:40.460 --> 01:52:43.080]  But it just didn't seem like he had great carrier relationships
[01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:45.820]  or he had anything that would make this a viable product.
[01:52:45.820 --> 01:52:48.200]  So I don't know if that's true now
[01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:50.580]  or whether it was just a trial balloon to get Google to take
[01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:51.580]  them back.
[01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:54.500]  Right, and just buy them and have the essential takeover
[01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:56.180]  as the Pixel.
[01:52:56.180 --> 01:52:59.300]  Or the high-end Pixel, whatever it would be.
[01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:01.340]  Pixel Pro, would it have made a huge difference?
[01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:01.900]  I don't know.
[01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:02.500]  Maybe not.
[01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:03.060]  I don't know.
[01:53:03.060 --> 01:53:05.420]  But it just seems to me like they missed an opportunity
[01:53:05.420 --> 01:53:08.860]  by shooting for just $900 because then you're
[01:53:08.860 --> 01:53:12.420]  only shooting for the same level that the iPhone's already at.
[01:53:12.420 --> 01:53:14.340]  Why not try to make a $1,500 phone
[01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:17.140]  for people who truly live on their phone and truly treat it?
[01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:21.980]  It really is their most important device in their day.
[01:53:21.980 --> 01:53:25.140]  And again, I know people who vouch for this,
[01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:28.580]  or at least on many days, that their iPhone or whatever
[01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:32.180]  their phone is, is their more important, most used device
[01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:33.380]  all day, every day.
[01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:37.100]  Well, if those people have been buying $2,000 or $2,500
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:39.980]  laptops for years as professional devices,
[01:53:39.980 --> 01:53:46.220]  why not let them buy a $2,000 phone?
[01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:48.300]  Yeah, and marketing is entirely about perception.
[01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:50.260]  There's very little that's attached to reality.
[01:53:50.260 --> 01:53:52.620]  Like, we pay $100 more for more gigabytes
[01:53:52.620 --> 01:53:55.220]  because it just seems like an acceptable thing.
[01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:58.500]  And we've become accustomed to it being an acceptable thing.
[01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:01.220]  But there really is no reality behind that.
[01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:02.380]  And this is the same thing.
[01:54:02.380 --> 01:54:04.540]  I bought the Apple Watch Edition, the ceramic one.
[01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:06.860]  And it's the same as the aluminum one.
[01:54:06.860 --> 01:54:09.700]  It is a great Apple Watch just because I thought, oh,
[01:54:09.700 --> 01:54:11.820]  ceramic, it's neat.
[01:54:11.820 --> 01:54:13.580]  We'll do all of those sorts of things.
[01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:15.420]  You just have to give us a compelling product
[01:54:15.420 --> 01:54:17.020]  and a compelling story for it.
[01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:19.220]  And this had neither of those things.
[01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:20.740]  It was a sort of interesting product
[01:54:20.740 --> 01:54:22.660]  that Samsung has kind of done already,
[01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:26.140]  but there was no hook to make people want it, I don't think.
[01:54:26.140 --> 01:54:30.060]  Yeah, and the second gen Apple Watch Edition,
[01:54:30.060 --> 01:54:32.380]  the ceramic one, is such a more compelling device
[01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:34.500]  than the first generation gold one.
[01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:37.740]  And I got caught up in it and kind of did a good job
[01:54:37.740 --> 01:54:40.660]  guessing about just how high those prices were going to be.
[01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:43.860]  Because at the time, people were thinking
[01:54:43.860 --> 01:54:46.740]  it was going to be like $1,500 for maybe $2,000,
[01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:48.860]  like a ridiculous $2,000 for a gold Apple Watch.
[01:54:48.860 --> 01:54:51.060]  And I'm like, you guys are out of your freaking minds.
[01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:55.460]  This thing is going to be like at least $10,000, maybe $20,000.
[01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:58.660]  And everybody was like, no one's going to buy that.
[01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:00.580]  And it ends up we were both right.
[01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:04.540]  It was $15,000 to $20,000, and nobody bought it.
[01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:06.540]  Whereas the new edition is so much more compelling
[01:55:06.540 --> 01:55:11.500]  because it's, again, it's more than most people
[01:55:11.500 --> 01:55:12.940]  are going to spend on an Apple Watch.
[01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:16.100]  And I can't say, I'm not sure I've ever seen one in the wild.
[01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:17.940]  I know I've seen yours.
[01:55:17.940 --> 01:55:21.580]  Yeah, I've seen one, I think, by Leos.
[01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:23.900]  Leo Lepore doesn't count.
[01:55:23.900 --> 01:55:25.540]  Although I remember being in Vegas,
[01:55:25.540 --> 01:55:29.580]  and I did see, I've seen gold Apple Watches.
[01:55:29.580 --> 01:55:32.820]  It truly is conspicuous consumption.
[01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:36.820]  I've seen them in Palo Alto, which is not a surprise.
[01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:38.580]  I just saw a video, I know.
[01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:42.300]  I was watching a video in, what's her name?
[01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:44.100]  I don't even know her YouTube name.
[01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:46.940]  iJustine, Justine Zarek.
[01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:49.140]  She has one, and it was like, wow, that looks great.
[01:55:49.140 --> 01:55:52.260]  She had the white ceramic Apple Watch with a blue band on,
[01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:54.820]  and it's a really good look.
[01:55:54.820 --> 01:55:55.860]  Much more compelling.
[01:55:55.860 --> 01:55:57.940]  Anyway, it's interesting, and I thought this last year.
[01:55:57.940 --> 01:55:58.980]  I remember when it came out, I was like,
[01:55:58.980 --> 01:56:00.180]  it'd be interesting if that's something
[01:56:00.180 --> 01:56:01.780]  they're going to do for an iPhone.
[01:56:01.780 --> 01:56:05.300]  And the response was, people who know about making ceramics
[01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:08.180]  are like, well, you can't make 200 million ceramic cases
[01:56:08.180 --> 01:56:09.580]  in a year, it's impossible.
[01:56:09.580 --> 01:56:12.740]  So it'd be interesting if it's maybe something,
[01:56:12.740 --> 01:56:15.140]  well, we don't plan to make 200 million of these.
[01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:18.100]  Yes, it's titanium or ceramic or some combination
[01:56:18.100 --> 01:56:20.220]  like the essential is of different materials.
[01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:23.460]  All right, let me think, what else?
[01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:24.580]  What else do we have time?
[01:56:24.580 --> 01:56:31.220]  We've got to wrap up soon, but naming, I have this.
[01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:34.140]  I have this note that I get at least once a day
[01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:35.860]  when this stuff comes up, somebody suggests
[01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:38.460]  that they're going to say, well, the new regular phones
[01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:41.260]  would be iPhone 7S and 7S Plus, or maybe they'll
[01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:44.220]  be iPhone 8 and 8S or 8 Plus.
[01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:46.460]  And that the new super phone, instead
[01:56:46.460 --> 01:56:47.960]  of being called iPhone, they're going
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:49.620]  to call it the Apple phone.
[01:56:49.620 --> 01:56:50.580]  Yeah, I saw that too.
[01:56:50.580 --> 01:56:53.180]  I get a couple of these a week.
[01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:54.900]  And I understand the logic of it, where
[01:56:54.900 --> 01:56:59.020]  it seems like for a long time in the jobs era,
[01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:03.220]  new Apple products would come out named i-something.
[01:57:03.220 --> 01:57:06.820]  iPod, iPhone, iPad.
[01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:09.740]  And it can't help but suspect that that was something
[01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:12.020]  that Jobs was particularly fond of.
[01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:14.460]  And in the post-Jobs era, they tend
[01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:17.820]  to name new products with just Apple and then
[01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:20.900]  a very plain description of what it is, the Apple
[01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:24.540]  Pencil, the Apple Watch.
[01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:25.420]  So I get that.
[01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:28.260]  And so if the first phone Apple was ever
[01:57:28.260 --> 01:57:29.860]  going to ship was coming out this year,
[01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:31.620]  I would heavily bet that it would just
[01:57:31.620 --> 01:57:34.700]  be called the Apple phone.
[01:57:34.700 --> 01:57:36.220]  But it's not.
[01:57:36.220 --> 01:57:40.140]  I'm still surprised it was an Apple hub that was HomePod.
[01:57:40.140 --> 01:57:41.140]  They throw curveballs.
[01:57:41.140 --> 01:57:46.020]  Yeah, they still do use non-Apple names,
[01:57:46.020 --> 01:57:46.920]  or Apple speaker.
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:50.940]  I wonder if that was the second running name.
[01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:52.740]  Anyway, there is absolutely no way
[01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:54.580]  that they can change the name of any iPhone
[01:57:54.580 --> 01:57:57.020]  from iPhone to anything else, no matter what you think
[01:57:57.020 --> 01:57:58.020]  about what they're doing.
[01:57:58.020 --> 01:58:01.020]  And you have to understand that even products like the iPod
[01:58:01.020 --> 01:58:04.100]  Touch, people still call it, even though they don't even
[01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:06.340]  sell many of them anymore, people still call it the iTouch
[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:08.700]  because they thought it would be named iTouch.
[01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:12.340]  And I still hear people calling the Apple Watch the iWatch.
[01:58:12.340 --> 01:58:14.900]  So even a product that never was called the iWatch
[01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:16.700]  gets called the iWatch.
[01:58:16.700 --> 01:58:19.900]  The strength of a brand is outside the control
[01:58:19.900 --> 01:58:21.700]  of the brand owner once it's established.
[01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:22.380]  And the strength of the iPhone.
[01:58:22.380 --> 01:58:25.580]  I hear normal people calling the Apple store the iPhone store
[01:58:25.580 --> 01:58:26.500]  when they won't buy it.
[01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:27.620]  Yeah.
[01:58:27.620 --> 01:58:30.300]  I remember when it was called the iPod store.
[01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:32.100]  Yeah.
[01:58:32.100 --> 01:58:34.820]  That's when I knew that the, what do you call it?
[01:58:34.820 --> 01:58:36.660]  What do they call it?
[01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:38.780]  What was the theory of how they might end up
[01:58:38.780 --> 01:58:42.780]  selling more Macs because of the iPod's popularity?
[01:58:42.780 --> 01:58:44.700]  Oh, right, yeah, the halo effect.
[01:58:44.700 --> 01:58:46.660]  That's how I thought that the halo effect might
[01:58:46.660 --> 01:58:48.460]  definitely be real because it seemed to me
[01:58:48.460 --> 01:58:52.260]  like there was more brand awareness of iPod than Apple.
[01:58:52.260 --> 01:58:56.380]  The strength of the iPhone brand is far outside Apple's control.
[01:58:56.380 --> 01:59:01.780]  There's nothing Apple can do to bottle that up.
[01:59:01.780 --> 01:59:03.140]  Brands have a life of their own.
[01:59:03.140 --> 01:59:04.740]  And they couldn't change the name to Apple phone,
[01:59:04.740 --> 01:59:05.740]  even if they wanted to.
[01:59:05.740 --> 01:59:08.460]  But I think they shouldn't want to.
[01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:10.620]  It makes no more sense to change the name of the iPhone
[01:59:10.620 --> 01:59:12.160]  to Apple phone at this point than it
[01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:15.060]  would be to change the MacBook to Apple Book.
[01:59:15.060 --> 01:59:15.740]  Apple Book, yeah.
[01:59:15.740 --> 01:59:16.740]  I mean, they could do it.
[01:59:16.740 --> 01:59:18.900]  But it would be a huge risk for very nebulous rewards.
[01:59:18.900 --> 01:59:19.420]  Yeah.
[01:59:19.420 --> 01:59:23.100]  It's so, I get it.
[01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:23.980]  It's not silly.
[01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:25.380]  But if you really think about it,
[01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:29.060]  it's not worth really going into.
[01:59:29.060 --> 01:59:29.720]  That's about it.
[01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:32.300]  I have this whole rant about iOS notification center and 3D
[01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:32.800]  touch.
[01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:34.860]  But we don't have time for it.
[01:59:34.860 --> 01:59:36.700]  Yeah, I have the same rants.
[01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:38.420]  That's why we, that's why we, that's
[01:59:38.420 --> 01:59:40.020]  why there's next week's show.
[01:59:40.020 --> 01:59:46.060]  Anything else you really wanted to talk about this week?
[01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:47.860]  Anything about this stuff?
[01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:49.020]  No, this was the big thing.
[01:59:49.020 --> 01:59:51.160]  And again, my whole point is, because we're
[01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:52.900]  getting a lot of really weird feedback on this,
[01:59:52.900 --> 01:59:54.480]  is that we're putting these, I always
[01:59:54.480 --> 01:59:57.340]  think that part of my job is, and I think you do this too,
[01:59:57.340 --> 01:59:59.920]  is to try to understand what Apple is doing
[01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:00.940]  and express that.
[02:00:00.940 --> 02:00:02.900]  And that way, if people want to hate on something,
[02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:04.220]  they can hate on it in an informed way.
[02:00:04.220 --> 02:00:05.580]  Because I really hate when, see, I'm
[02:00:05.580 --> 02:00:06.940]  going to say hate on something now.
[02:00:06.940 --> 02:00:09.980]  For me, the classic example is the iPhone smart battery case.
[02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:12.320]  Where it came out, and Apple absolutely
[02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:13.480]  did not do any messaging.
[02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:15.900]  If ever a product needed Phil Schiller on stage explaining
[02:00:15.900 --> 02:00:16.860]  it, that one did.
[02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:19.780]  But it was inarguably a better, more efficient, smarter take
[02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:20.660]  at the case.
[02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:23.020]  And all reviewers did is look at like the cost
[02:00:23.020 --> 02:00:25.660]  per milliamp hour, or the hump on it.
[02:00:25.660 --> 02:00:27.620]  And they didn't try to understand that it got out
[02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:29.580]  of the antenna's way, that it didn't block signal,
[02:00:29.580 --> 02:00:33.660]  that it actually amplified, all these really smart things.
[02:00:33.660 --> 02:00:36.020]  And if you did like it, then you were just an Apple shill.
[02:00:36.020 --> 02:00:39.380]  And I think all of this stuff, all this,
[02:00:39.380 --> 02:00:41.380]  us thinking out loud like this, is sort of come
[02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:42.500]  to terms with Apple's doing.
[02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:44.540]  And then when they actually announce something,
[02:00:44.540 --> 02:00:46.300]  I don't know about you, but I'll decide then
[02:00:46.300 --> 02:00:47.300]  whether I like it or not.
[02:00:47.300 --> 02:00:49.620]  But I'll do it for reasons, not just because it's
[02:00:49.620 --> 02:00:52.540]  easy to get a headline for hating on Apple.
[02:00:52.540 --> 02:00:56.100]  And the other thing about the Apple battery pack case
[02:00:56.100 --> 02:00:58.140]  that I don't think got near anywhere
[02:00:58.140 --> 02:01:00.700]  near as enough critical thought is
[02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:04.980]  how it doesn't change your charging needs at all.
[02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:07.220]  So let's say you're already traveling, what do you need?
[02:01:07.220 --> 02:01:09.780]  You absolutely need a wall thing,
[02:01:09.780 --> 02:01:11.380]  you need a thing to put in a wall,
[02:01:11.380 --> 02:01:16.380]  and you need a lightning cable that has USB on one side
[02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:19.820]  to plug into the charger and lightning to plug in the phone.
[02:01:19.820 --> 02:01:23.580]  So now you wanna get a battery pack or a battery pack case.
[02:01:23.580 --> 02:01:24.780]  Now what do you need?
[02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:26.300]  Well, if it's any other battery pack,
[02:01:26.300 --> 02:01:29.540]  you need, now you need a micro USB cable,
[02:01:29.540 --> 02:01:31.700]  because that's what charges all the other battery packs
[02:01:31.700 --> 02:01:34.300]  and battery pack cases, and now you need two cables.
[02:01:35.500 --> 02:01:36.880]  And depending on how the case works,
[02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:39.180]  if it does charge through, you might still need both,
[02:01:39.180 --> 02:01:41.700]  because you might overnight need to charge the phone
[02:01:41.700 --> 02:01:44.220]  separately from the battery pack.
[02:01:44.220 --> 02:01:46.940]  And now you need two chargers with two different cables.
[02:01:46.940 --> 02:01:51.800]  And that's, as somebody who often packs a battery case
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:53.620]  while going on vacation, or especially to like
[02:01:53.620 --> 02:01:55.900]  a technical conference like Macworld or something,
[02:01:55.900 --> 02:01:57.860]  or, well, I guess there is no more Macworld,
[02:01:57.860 --> 02:02:00.540]  but like WWDC, where I know I'm gonna be on the phone
[02:02:00.540 --> 02:02:02.580]  all the time and it's gonna be bad
[02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:05.420]  in terms of cell phone reception and Wi-Fi and stuff,
[02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:08.760]  it's a huge pain in the ass.
[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:09.960]  It's a huge pain in the ass.
[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:12.240]  God, how much I wish somebody would make,
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:14.400]  somebody would pay whatever it takes to license it
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:17.520]  to make a regular battery pack that just charges
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:19.720]  by lightning, so I don't need to pack anything
[02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:20.840]  other than lightning cables.
[02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:22.580]  Anyway, totally agree.
[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:26.680]  That was my, not that I'm bitter.
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:28.480]  Me.
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:33.060]  All right, I can't think of anything else.
[02:02:33.060 --> 02:02:37.200]  Rene, Richie, I appreciate your feedback.
[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:38.040]  Thank you so much.
[02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:41.840]  And I got a thing in here to the article you wrote.
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:43.580]  I swear to God it's gonna be in the show notes
[02:02:43.580 --> 02:02:46.000]  on the iPhones of future past.
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.540]  You beat me to it, I really love it,
[02:02:47.540 --> 02:02:50.140]  is that how are they gonna sell this thing?
[02:02:50.140 --> 02:02:52.700]  I think you're onto something where the best way
[02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:55.520]  to sell it is to, here's this year's new iPhones.
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:57.040]  They're just as great as you'd expect
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:02:58.240]  this year's new iPhones to be.
[02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:00.680]  And we have this new thing that we're doing,
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:01.940]  which is we're giving you a sneak peek
[02:03:01.940 --> 02:03:05.280]  at the future of iPhones, and you can buy it today
[02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:06.340]  for whatever.
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:10.200]  I totally think that that's the best idea I have
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:12.840]  of how they make this go down.
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:15.360]  It's gonna be an incredibly interesting marketing challenge
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:16.280]  to watch either way.
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:18.360]  Yeah, I'm super excited about it, who knows.
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:19.680]  And again, who knows, the other thing
[02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:21.580]  that could render this whole thing moot
[02:03:21.580 --> 02:03:24.080]  would be like an avalanche of super spot
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:26.640]  on accurate leaks in August.
[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:28.400]  I mean, Jaws knows, but he's not telling us.
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:29.740]  Oh no, definitely not.
[02:03:29.740 --> 02:03:33.660]  No, I think Jaws, well, you know, we said this.
[02:03:33.660 --> 02:03:36.860]  I said that the role that product marketing plays in this,
[02:03:36.860 --> 02:03:41.340]  and I mean, obviously Phil Schiller is obviously involved,
[02:03:41.340 --> 02:03:43.820]  and Johnny's involved, and whoever else,
[02:03:43.820 --> 02:03:45.880]  but god, the weight of the world's gotta be
[02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:48.180]  on Jaws' shoulders, because Jaws has really,
[02:03:51.300 --> 02:03:54.300]  his title didn't change, or did a little, is he?
[02:03:54.300 --> 02:03:56.260]  Yeah, so he used to be header product marketing
[02:03:56.260 --> 02:03:58.060]  for iOS devices, now he's header product marketing
[02:03:58.060 --> 02:04:00.780]  for everything, for all devices, like Macs, iPhones,
[02:04:00.780 --> 02:04:02.100]  everything.
[02:04:02.100 --> 02:04:07.100]  It's, you know, I'm sure, it's been a busy year
[02:04:08.380 --> 02:04:09.220]  for Steve.
[02:04:09.220 --> 02:04:11.020]  He's a good person for it, a good person for the job.
[02:04:11.020 --> 02:04:13.300]  Yeah, exactly, so anyway, I'm excited about it.
[02:04:13.300 --> 02:04:16.540]  We've got, what do we have, probably about seven weeks.
[02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:17.380]  And I guess that's the last thing,
[02:04:17.380 --> 02:04:18.340]  we wanna talk about one more thing,
[02:04:18.340 --> 02:04:20.500]  is do you think the event is still going
[02:04:20.500 --> 02:04:23.380]  to be early September, combined with these rumors
[02:04:23.380 --> 02:04:25.460]  of at least one of the, you know, the one phone
[02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:28.180]  being delayed, and possibly all of them?
[02:04:28.180 --> 02:04:30.580]  Yeah, I mean, I think that for a variety of reasons,
[02:04:30.580 --> 02:04:32.300]  it's better for Apple if they get that event
[02:04:32.300 --> 02:04:33.460]  out of the way, sometimes they've done it
[02:04:33.460 --> 02:04:35.240]  a little bit later in September, but in general,
[02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:36.620]  they've had a September event for as long
[02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:38.900]  as I can remember, and even if they do say,
[02:04:38.900 --> 02:04:40.620]  you know, this product is coming at this date,
[02:04:40.620 --> 02:04:43.140]  like, it was two years ago where the iPad Pro
[02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:45.020]  came out a month later, and then Apple TV
[02:04:45.020 --> 02:04:47.020]  came out two months later, or vice versa,
[02:04:47.020 --> 02:04:49.740]  they still did the announcement in September.
[02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:51.620]  Yeah, I keep track of this stuff.
[02:04:51.620 --> 02:04:56.620]  Last few years, iPhone 5 was Wednesday,
[02:04:56.700 --> 02:04:59.420]  September 12th, iPhone 5S was Tuesday,
[02:04:59.420 --> 02:05:03.700]  September 10th, this iPhone 6 was Tuesday the 9th,
[02:05:03.700 --> 02:05:05.980]  so it went from the 12th to the 10th to the 9th,
[02:05:05.980 --> 02:05:07.780]  Wednesday, Tuesday, Tuesday.
[02:05:07.780 --> 02:05:10.880]  iPhone 6S was a Wednesday on the 9th,
[02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:13.000]  and iPhone 7 and 7 Plus last year
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.240]  were on Wednesday the 7th, so if anything,
[02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:17.260]  it's actually moved down from September 12th
[02:05:17.260 --> 02:05:20.500]  to 10th to 9th to 9th to 7th, and I think
[02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:21.940]  the Tuesday, Wednesday thing has always been
[02:05:21.940 --> 02:05:25.220]  about a Labor Day thing, and that if the Monday
[02:05:25.220 --> 02:05:28.140]  of the week that they wanna have it is Labor Day,
[02:05:28.140 --> 02:05:32.800]  they don't make everybody travel on Labor Day,
[02:05:32.800 --> 02:05:34.820]  combined with not making anybody who has to do
[02:05:34.820 --> 02:05:37.500]  setup for the thing, you know, give them an extra day,
[02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:39.420]  you know, for Labor Day.
[02:05:39.420 --> 02:05:41.580]  I think one of them, the 6S, was a three-week delay
[02:05:41.580 --> 02:05:43.020]  for shipping instead of a two-week delay,
[02:05:43.020 --> 02:05:45.100]  which they usually do, so they can play around
[02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:45.940]  with all that as well.
[02:05:45.940 --> 02:05:49.500]  So Labor Day, actually don't know
[02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:51.380]  when Labor Day is this year, hold on a second.
[02:05:51.380 --> 02:05:52.260]  Is it the 4th?
[02:05:52.260 --> 02:05:53.540]  Yeah, it's the 4th.
[02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:55.500]  So if they do it the week of Labor Day,
[02:05:55.500 --> 02:05:57.460]  they would have the event on the 6th,
[02:05:57.460 --> 02:05:59.620]  which would be the earliest they've ever had it.
[02:05:59.620 --> 02:06:04.020]  Otherwise, I'm guessing it would be the September 12th.
[02:06:04.020 --> 02:06:05.800]  Yeah, which is also a normal day for them.
[02:06:05.800 --> 02:06:10.500]  Yeah, and the 12th is a date that they have used before
[02:06:10.500 --> 02:06:11.420]  with the iPhone 5.
[02:06:12.900 --> 02:06:14.940]  That's what I expect, that would be the normal schedule.
[02:06:14.940 --> 02:06:18.540]  It's either going to be September 6th or September 12th.
[02:06:18.540 --> 02:06:19.920]  If they move it back, I don't know.
[02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:20.760]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:24.780]  4S was October, so that was the latest they've ever done it,
[02:06:24.780 --> 02:06:27.180]  and that was for a variety of reasons that are not normal.
[02:06:27.180 --> 02:06:31.940]  Yeah, yeah, this is not even going to go there.
[02:06:31.940 --> 02:06:36.720]  But anyway, I think that it's probably going to either
[02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:38.180]  be the 6th if they're on schedule
[02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:39.820]  or the 12th if they're a little late,
[02:06:39.820 --> 02:06:41.540]  and then they'll just have a three-week delay
[02:06:41.540 --> 02:06:43.720]  after the 12th or something like that.
[02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:45.180]  But we shall see.
[02:06:45.180 --> 02:06:46.020]  So what do we have?
[02:06:46.020 --> 02:06:47.260]  We shall see.
[02:06:47.260 --> 02:06:50.340]  So anyway, thank you, Rene.
[02:06:50.340 --> 02:07:17.340]  Oh, no, my pleasure, thank you.
