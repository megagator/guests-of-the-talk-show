[00:00.000 --> 00:06.160]  Been a heck of a day. I've had a very interesting 30 hours.
[00:10.080 --> 00:15.120]  Yesterday morning, we woke up early. I knew I had jury duty at the Superior Court.
[00:15.120 --> 00:15.620]  Wow.
[00:16.240 --> 00:17.120]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:17.120 --> 00:18.160]  On voting day.
[00:18.880 --> 00:23.520]  I only found out finally yesterday that I'm registered under two addresses,
[00:23.520 --> 00:29.280]  and basically that's why I get called constantly. And I'm jury crack. I always get called,
[00:29.280 --> 00:33.440]  I always get picked. And no matter what I say, they're like, that's great, we could really use
[00:33.440 --> 00:37.600]  you. So, and in this case Superior Court, oh my God, what's it going to be? Long story short,
[00:37.600 --> 00:44.480]  we get up early. The three of us go to the polling station. My daughter drops in the ballot
[00:44.480 --> 00:50.880]  for Hillary Clinton. I go to jury duty. I narrowly, narrowly avoid a multi-month
[00:50.880 --> 00:58.560]  attempted murder jury duty. John Gruber, I'm literally rocking in my seat and making this
[00:58.560 --> 01:08.720]  noise. I won't drag this out, but basically I pleaded hardship, even though they said they're
[01:08.720 --> 01:14.720]  probably not going to let us off for that. I standingly got deferred. I walk up Sixth Street.
[01:14.720 --> 01:15.840]  Are you familiar with Sixth Street?
[01:15.840 --> 01:22.880]  I am. I am. You know what? I am oddly familiar with Sixth Street in San Francisco.
[01:22.880 --> 01:25.440]  You don't unsee Sixth Street. You don't forget Sixth Street.
[01:25.440 --> 01:28.560]  Right. I walk up Sixth Street and it is,
[01:30.320 --> 01:35.040]  it's like a Godspeed You Black Emperor song. It's just a lot of people with sores and amputations.
[01:35.040 --> 01:39.840]  I saw a sobbing man pooping on the street. There's a lot of screaming and dogs and it's basically,
[01:39.840 --> 01:47.040]  it's like the end of the world. And that was my morning up till about 1130. So then I just went
[01:47.040 --> 01:50.560]  home and started rocking at home. I couldn't even play threes. I'm just rocking, going,
[01:50.560 --> 01:55.360]  hmm, because I'm already, I'm sorry, I'm monopolizing your show, but I've been,
[01:55.360 --> 01:57.600]  I don't want to make a big deal about it because I think it's unseemly.
[01:57.600 --> 02:00.560]  It was a bad start. It was a bad start to a bad day.
[02:00.560 --> 02:06.160]  And I hope that it would, those would all be good, good portents. But that was my morning.
[02:06.160 --> 02:10.880]  And then, yeah, how are you feeling? You having a good day?
[02:10.880 --> 02:22.640]  No, here's the thing. I think you and I owe it to the world. We owe it to America. We're going to,
[02:22.640 --> 02:25.920]  we're going to do this show and we're going to do a show for everybody.
[02:27.760 --> 02:30.000]  Okay. You don't have to be an Apple fan.
[02:30.000 --> 02:30.960]  Are you with me so far?
[02:31.600 --> 02:34.400]  Oh, I'm so with you. You're going to get notes.
[02:35.360 --> 02:37.920]  We're going to get notes because we're going to miss some people.
[02:37.920 --> 02:45.520]  Well, we're trying to scoop up everybody. We're trying to, we're, we're, we've,
[02:47.600 --> 02:51.280]  I don't know. We've got the scoop. We're coming in for everybody.
[02:54.080 --> 02:55.600]  Are you having a holiday party there?
[03:02.320 --> 03:06.480]  Merlin, we're coming in. We're, we're coming in with the scoop. We're coming in for everybody.
[03:06.480 --> 03:08.960]  Yeah. We're going to try to pick everybody up.
[03:08.960 --> 03:09.920]  Yeah. Okay.
[03:09.920 --> 03:14.960]  And we're going to miss some people. There's no doubt about it. There's no way.
[03:14.960 --> 03:17.200]  You can't get every person. That's the first person you learn.
[03:17.200 --> 03:21.680]  Right. And I, we're going to miss some people.
[03:23.600 --> 03:24.160]  Yeah.
[03:24.160 --> 03:32.080]  This is an, in my opinion, this is the most special episode of this podcast I've ever
[03:32.080 --> 03:39.520]  recorded. I've recorded many, uh, star wars. That one's your, isn't that still your record holder?
[03:39.520 --> 03:44.320]  Yeah. Oh, of course. Star Wars episodes are around an eight episode, eight hours long.
[03:44.320 --> 03:51.440]  Okay. And you know, I mean, we've had, I mean, we've had Harrison Ford on, we've had Mark Hamill
[03:51.440 --> 03:57.360]  on. He was a lot nicer than I expected. Carrie Fisher. I mean, some very special guests.
[03:57.360 --> 03:58.000]  Yeah.
[03:58.000 --> 04:04.640]  For those episodes. Nothing is going to compare to this episode of the show and I will tell you
[04:05.600 --> 04:08.960]  no, no pressure. Well, there was only one person.
[04:08.960 --> 04:12.080]  We're trying to scoop up everybody, but we're going to miss some people.
[04:12.080 --> 04:18.880]  Well, I will tell you this. I mean, I'm going to be honest, open kimono. I'm opening the kimono here.
[04:18.880 --> 04:31.600]  I am not happy with the election results. I honestly fear for the state of Western democracy.
[04:34.160 --> 04:42.000]  I absolutely positively had too much to drink last night. And when I woke up this morning,
[04:42.000 --> 04:51.680]  I thought there's only one person I can ask to be on my show today. And it's Merlin. And I will
[04:51.680 --> 04:59.680]  say this, I reached out to you for this very special emergency episode, right? Cause I'll
[04:59.680 --> 05:08.720]  tell you what I am in general. I try, I try to go once a week and once a week would have put me
[05:08.720 --> 05:17.600]  like a couple of days before the election and a couple of days ago, I was too pre-election
[05:17.600 --> 05:24.960]  obsessed. And I thought nobody wants to hear pre pre pre-election obsessed, John Gruber,
[05:26.640 --> 05:34.080]  talk about the keyboard on the new Mac book pro. Right. I mean, who the fuck cares about
[05:34.080 --> 05:41.520]  the goddamn key travel on the Mac book pro two or three days before the end of Western
[05:41.520 --> 05:47.600]  civilization. And so I thought I can't do it. I probably should have, I should have just done
[05:47.600 --> 05:54.080]  like a regular show, just called molt up again. You know what I mean? You know, couldn't you also,
[05:54.080 --> 06:04.880]  you as a person, you enjoy, you enjoy a winning franchise with a story. Oh, I do. And one thing
[06:04.880 --> 06:07.920]  I've learned from you and I share with a lot of people is that distinction you made one time,
[06:07.920 --> 06:13.600]  I think on this program, talking about how there's numbers people in baseball and there's
[06:13.600 --> 06:18.000]  story people, you know, with regard to fans. And I still actually, I still think about that a lot.
[06:18.000 --> 06:22.640]  And it did have an effect on how I think about sports as a thing, but I'm not trying to take
[06:22.640 --> 06:26.400]  I'm not trying to take the piss. I mean, you, you, you like, you know, you, you like the,
[06:27.120 --> 06:31.760]  you like the Yankees, you like what the Cowboys, right? You like, you like these teams with a
[06:31.760 --> 06:40.240]  storied past who are going to win. So it, it makes sense for you to wait until the inevitable win
[06:41.600 --> 06:47.200]  to be able to, to talk about it in a way that's, I don't know, more celebratory. I mean, why,
[06:47.200 --> 06:54.400]  why be jittery on air? Cause it all seemed like it was going in the right direction. Mostly,
[06:55.680 --> 06:58.880]  mostly. I mean, this is, I mean, I don't even know where to begin.
[06:58.880 --> 07:05.680]  You know what? I'll just tell you this. I was thinking last night and I, I, early on,
[07:05.680 --> 07:10.880]  early on, I started tweeting less because you know what? I started thinking like,
[07:10.880 --> 07:17.440]  you know what I like to do. And I think people who, who, you know, certainly people who listen
[07:17.440 --> 07:22.880]  to the show, but people who follow me on Twitter certainly know, I like to tweet during sporting
[07:22.880 --> 07:33.280]  events. I care about, and it is a similar feeling in my stomach when there's like a sporting event,
[07:33.280 --> 07:41.680]  I care about and an election I care about, but then there's a difference. And the difference
[07:41.680 --> 07:49.920]  is that sports don't mean anything that, and that's kind of the fun part about sports.
[07:49.920 --> 07:54.320]  And I know that there's everything that, everything that's wonderful about sports is what
[07:54.320 --> 08:00.240]  the fan brings to it. You can choose to bring all different kinds of history and expectations and
[08:00.240 --> 08:06.640]  import, but like you, you get to pick what you're going to be very emotional about and you get to
[08:06.640 --> 08:10.400]  kind of, on some rational level, you get to decide why those stakes are important to you.
[08:10.400 --> 08:18.160]  Right. Like if six months ago you, you, something happened and you had a terrible head injury and
[08:18.160 --> 08:26.080]  you went into a coma, but you're a terrific baseball fan and you don't wake up until like
[08:26.080 --> 08:32.560]  the middle of next year and you wake up and you're like, who won the World Series?
[08:32.560 --> 08:42.960]  And somebody tells you, well, it was the Cubs. The state of the world outside the word C-U-B-S,
[08:42.960 --> 08:52.000]  Cubs, is actually not any different than if they said, oh my God, it was the Cleveland Indians.
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.400]  Or I feel like I only hear this, but a lot of people say that was probably one of the,
[08:57.040 --> 09:00.480]  definitely one of the better World Series games. Some people will put that in like their top 50
[09:00.480 --> 09:04.960]  games. Yeah. No, there's people who would put it in their top five games. I mean, it was an amazing
[09:04.960 --> 09:15.360]  game. But the truth of the matter is that outside of the baseball park, it doesn't really matter.
[09:15.360 --> 09:21.760]  And that is, so I do, I woke up yesterday and I thought, you know what? This feels like when the
[09:21.760 --> 09:26.400]  Yankees are in the World Series. I feel like I've got that feeling. I care. I can't sleep.
[09:27.280 --> 09:35.920]  I'm jittery. Except I know that this time it cares. And in one regard, it makes me say,
[09:35.920 --> 09:41.920]  this is why sports are great. And in the other regard, it makes me say, this is why a lot of
[09:41.920 --> 09:51.440]  smart people don't give two craps about sports because sports are actually nonsense. And I
[09:51.440 --> 10:04.480]  kind of feel like this election brings that into focus. Yeah. There's, I mean, I don't like getting
[10:04.480 --> 10:10.160]  involved in a lot of political, I don't like talking about politics in public. I have my
[10:10.160 --> 10:14.800]  feelings about all kinds of stuff in life and who knows, maybe it's time for me to talk more about
[10:14.800 --> 10:24.320]  it. But I feel like, generally speaking, the cost benefit analysis on having a strong public opinion
[10:24.320 --> 10:31.040]  that's unambiguous and you argue about it a lot and you encourage people just to pick or continue
[10:31.760 --> 10:36.640]  fights with you, that's just, that's not my personality. It's not how I want to live. It's
[10:36.640 --> 10:41.040]  not who I want to be, but that doesn't mean I don't have those strong opinions.
[10:41.040 --> 10:47.360]  So my card's on the table. And I'm that guy. I'm that guy that used to say, get rid of all
[10:47.360 --> 10:52.720]  your news tabs, like stop following stuff, time and attention. But I have started listening to
[10:52.720 --> 11:00.080]  probably half a dozen podcasts about politics this election year, some of which come out every day
[11:00.080 --> 11:06.720]  or twice or three times a week. I've been utterly steeped in that. But at almost every step of the
[11:06.720 --> 11:13.200]  way, even when things were not looking great for the Democratic candidate, there was still
[11:13.200 --> 11:20.160]  this part of me that said, I think I understand enough about the bones of this country to know
[11:20.160 --> 11:28.320]  how this will end up. And on top of that, I see enough stuff from different sources of data that
[11:28.320 --> 11:33.920]  tells me it'll turn out okay. Is this going to be the best election ever? No. But I swear to Christ,
[11:33.920 --> 11:42.480]  like even up until yesterday, that confidence in the American bones is, I think I might have got
[11:42.480 --> 11:48.000]  it wrong. And so that's kind of when we were texting this morning, that's kind of where I am.
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.320]  I'm not too angry yet. I'm not too finger pointing. I'm not even to abject terror yet.
[11:52.320 --> 11:57.840]  I'm still stuck at sitting there in my living room with my family last night. My daughter was
[11:57.840 --> 12:02.560]  literally under a blanket. She put earplugs in and went under a blanket to read Wimpy Kid because
[12:02.560 --> 12:09.600]  she couldn't take it anymore. Yeah. I love the Wimpy Kid books. Oh, they're better than you
[12:09.600 --> 12:18.240]  think. But watching that little drip, drip, drip, and then seeing a state flip to red. And at first
[12:18.240 --> 12:22.240]  when we walked up, I picked her up at school like I do. I said, hey, look, he's got three on the
[12:22.240 --> 12:26.720]  board already. Don't worry. People knew he was going to get those. Those are not giant electoral
[12:26.720 --> 12:31.360]  states. She knows about this from school. But anyway, I don't mean to prattle on, but I'm here
[12:31.360 --> 12:41.680]  today because I'm not even to where I know I'm going to end up. I'm just stunned by how wrong I
[12:41.680 --> 12:53.440]  was and how poorly I saw. I think I'm going to be processing that for at least a few days. The words
[12:53.440 --> 12:59.680]  like shock and surprise, it sounds silly. I just listened to Keeping It 1600, which is a show I
[12:59.680 --> 13:06.320]  like a lot. They're just like, we got every single bit of this wrong, and we feel bad that we told
[13:06.320 --> 13:17.520]  you not to wet the bed. I'm babbling, but I'm sitting here and I'm stunned with how much I got
[13:17.520 --> 13:24.080]  wrong. I'll eventually try to figure out what I got wrong. But at this point, it's just an
[13:24.080 --> 13:30.400]  unconscionably large amount of assumptions that I had a fairly decent level of confidence in,
[13:31.680 --> 13:35.040]  that I'm going to have to just rethink a whole bunch of things that make me very uncomfortable.
[13:35.040 --> 13:53.840]  Well, let's make sure everybody feels included sick. But for, hey, everybody is sick of the
[13:55.520 --> 14:04.000]  divisive stuff is why I would love, and I think you agree that this episode of the show should
[14:04.000 --> 14:10.960]  not be like, hey, Hillary should have won. Donald Trump is an asshole. I don't want to divide people
[14:11.840 --> 14:17.360]  because, I mean, everybody's had enough of that. And the time for that...
[14:17.360 --> 14:22.160]  Not least because Democrats are the second most surprised party today.
[14:22.160 --> 14:23.360]  Right. I agree.
[14:23.360 --> 14:34.640]  I don't think most people in their hearts really believe this would go this way.
[14:34.640 --> 14:42.000]  I do. I agree. And I honestly think if we want to just for a moment get a little political,
[14:44.080 --> 14:51.280]  but seriously, Donald Trump's win is not a Republican win. It's a Trump win. What he is
[14:51.280 --> 15:00.960]  and what he represents and what drove his victory has almost nothing to do with the Republican party.
[15:02.400 --> 15:10.640]  But I would like for this episode of the show to be for everybody. And I will just tell you that
[15:10.640 --> 15:19.760]  my son, who is not... I wouldn't think is political because he's 12 years old. You know what
[15:19.760 --> 15:27.120]  I mean? He's way too young to be political. Before we sent him to bed last night, we were watching
[15:27.120 --> 15:36.320]  the results. They were obviously heading towards where we are. And he said that his stomach felt
[15:36.320 --> 15:43.840]  bad. And it killed me because what am I gonna say to him? You know what I mean? It's like...
[15:43.840 --> 15:54.640]  Yeah. Well, I think maybe less so as to get older, but kids pick up a lot from the people
[15:54.640 --> 15:57.040]  around them, particularly their parents. It doesn't mean they're gonna listen or put on
[15:57.040 --> 16:02.960]  their shoes, but they can read a lot of the emotional temperature and barometric pressure
[16:02.960 --> 16:07.200]  in the room. And we've talked a lot about this election at home, a lot, a lot, a lot.
[16:08.800 --> 16:15.120]  But I think the difference here is it's not that my team didn't win. It's that maybe I just don't
[16:15.120 --> 16:21.280]  understand baseball anymore. And that's a very different kind of thing to process. And I think,
[16:22.000 --> 16:26.000]  apart from the fact we're both crying a little bit, which is never fun to do in front of your
[16:26.000 --> 16:33.280]  kid, I think there was definitely the sense that this was something very much different.
[16:34.400 --> 16:37.920]  It's not like she sat and watched a bunch of presidential elections, but it felt like
[16:38.640 --> 16:45.760]  the stakes were higher than we had any idea. And then, God, what did Amy say today about...
[16:46.720 --> 16:52.320]  Could you share what happened at his school? Well, I mean, the one thing was that we got a
[16:52.320 --> 16:56.560]  letter from the principal of the school, the head of the school, whatever they call the guy.
[16:58.400 --> 17:06.800]  We got an actual email that said the rhetoric of the guy who won the presidential election
[17:06.800 --> 17:10.960]  is still no longer accepted at our school, which is like...
[17:12.960 --> 17:16.000]  That's like when... Did you get the creepy clown letter in October?
[17:16.000 --> 17:19.760]  Yes, we got the creepy clown letter. And I remember thinking, oh my God,
[17:19.760 --> 17:24.720]  I know how busy our principal is. And I can't believe that she had to take any amount of time
[17:24.720 --> 17:30.400]  from her day to acknowledge that there was such a thing as creepy clowns and then to feel the need
[17:30.400 --> 17:37.040]  or maybe the mandate. Maybe it came down from the Unified School District. But she had to say,
[17:37.040 --> 17:40.720]  there's a couple of other things I'm not going to do today because I need to email everybody
[17:40.720 --> 17:46.880]  about creepy clowns. And you're like, wow, that's... Just FYI, for my purposes, you don't
[17:46.880 --> 17:52.160]  need to keep on the creepy clown beat. I trust you on the strength to just take care of that.
[17:52.800 --> 17:56.320]  But that's something that your kid's principal felt they needed to do.
[17:59.600 --> 18:03.200]  On that note... On that note...
[18:03.200 --> 18:04.160]  You guys know fracture.
[18:09.840 --> 18:12.560]  Let me take a break and tell you about our first friend.
[18:12.560 --> 18:14.560]  We're going to laugh. We're laughing.
[18:14.560 --> 18:17.280]  If you're going to have a holiday party, I feel like I should have one, too.
[18:20.080 --> 18:23.680]  That's just what we need. Just need me to show up at my kid's school in two hours,
[18:23.680 --> 18:28.160]  just a little bit drunk. Everything's going to be fine, honey.
[18:31.360 --> 18:32.480]  That is just sleepy.
[18:35.920 --> 18:39.040]  Today's host of the talk show, that's Harry Caray.
[18:39.040 --> 18:44.640]  Today's host of the talk show, that's Harry Caray.
[18:44.640 --> 18:48.320]  Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[18:51.280 --> 18:58.880]  No, seriously, I mean, we're laughing because we're crying, but I want to tell you about our...
[19:02.720 --> 19:03.680]  You want me to take this one?
[19:04.800 --> 19:06.320]  Our good friends at Automattic.
[19:06.320 --> 19:08.960]  Oh, love Automattic.
[19:08.960 --> 19:14.320]  It's a small adapter. It turns your car into a smart connected car.
[19:15.760 --> 19:19.840]  They've just launched. I mean, seriously, within like the last
[19:19.840 --> 19:26.240]  month or so, the Automattic Pro, it's a new version of the device they already sold.
[19:26.240 --> 19:34.800]  In addition to all the cool stuff it already does, it includes unlimited 3G
[19:37.360 --> 19:42.800]  online internet connection. Exactly. You think, well, that sounds too good to be true.
[19:42.800 --> 19:47.120]  Well, look at your Kindle, your Kindle. Kindles have been doing this for years.
[19:47.120 --> 19:52.000]  I don't know how they worked out the deal with the 3G providers, but the Automattic people did it.
[19:52.000 --> 19:56.880]  It's a dingus. You plug it into your car.
[19:56.880 --> 20:02.640]  There's a port on every car made since like 1997, 1998, somewhere around there.
[20:04.080 --> 20:11.360]  There's a port and that's where when it says like, you know, you get like a thing on your
[20:11.360 --> 20:17.920]  dashboard that says like A1 service due or whatever. You don't know what A1 service is.
[20:17.920 --> 20:25.360]  You take it into the car dealer. They plug a thing into the this port and then
[20:25.920 --> 20:30.480]  it knows exactly what you need. Well, it turns out that's just an oil change or whatever.
[20:32.480 --> 20:39.680]  Automattic lets you plug their dingus. They have a dingus. That's what you buy. You plug it in
[20:39.680 --> 20:49.280]  and you get all that information, all the. All the service information that your car
[20:49.280 --> 20:56.320]  can provide to like a mechanic or a service provider, but instead you get it.
[20:56.320 --> 21:03.040]  You can, you know, if it's if it's nonsense, if it's just like, oh, you know, the light is,
[21:03.040 --> 21:07.200]  you know, one of the lights is out or something like that, you can just turn it off, whatever you
[21:07.200 --> 21:12.720]  want to do. Otherwise, though, it gives you so much information. It gives you information
[21:12.720 --> 21:20.480]  on your efficiency, on like how you're driving your car. It gives you information on
[21:22.000 --> 21:27.200]  like fuel efficiency, all that. John, John, John, it does it all. It's an it's an app.
[21:27.200 --> 21:31.040]  Plus, it's a dingus. You did mention it's a dingus. It's a fantastic thing. Here's the thing.
[21:31.040 --> 21:36.720]  Those fat cats, those fat cats in Detroit, they never or Tokyo or wherever, no offense,
[21:36.720 --> 21:40.160]  no one will be ping pong. They never intended you to use that port for this. That's true. That's for
[21:40.160 --> 21:43.920]  them. That's for them. That's their port. Don't use that. They're democratizing that port in a
[21:43.920 --> 21:47.120]  way that's very important in our country right now. You get that dingus, you get that app,
[21:47.120 --> 21:50.000]  you plug it in and you know what? You don't have to think about it. You're gonna hear this beep.
[21:50.000 --> 21:53.600]  That means it's working. You can have it yell at you when you break. You could have it tell you,
[21:53.600 --> 21:57.440]  hey, quit driving so fast, you dork. And now like John, for example, John lost his license now
[21:57.440 --> 22:02.240]  about five years ago. You were driving, I think you were driving 190 in a 30 mile per hour zone.
[22:02.240 --> 22:06.000]  Well, that was what they said I was doing. Was it that fast? It was pretty fast. I don't think
[22:06.000 --> 22:12.720]  that that's true, but that's what they flagged me for. 105 in a 30 zone. 105 in a 30. The
[22:12.720 --> 22:17.120]  speedometer only goes up so high. But you get this thing. It can do stuff. It'll automatically
[22:17.120 --> 22:22.720]  tag business trips for your expense purposes. It'll do all of that. And it will make you a
[22:22.720 --> 22:28.080]  better, better and more mindful driver. You don't have to think about it. It just works. It also
[22:28.080 --> 22:32.400]  works with things like IFTTT. You can hook it up to all kinds of different things. You can have it
[22:32.400 --> 22:36.640]  turn your frickin lights on when you pull home. This thing is dynamite. Are you laughing at my
[22:36.640 --> 22:43.120]  tweet? I'm, I'm laughing because you're the only person and you know, I don't know if anybody who
[22:43.120 --> 22:51.120]  who listens to this podcast regularly has noticed. There's a couple of regulars who come back.
[22:51.120 --> 22:57.280]  You're the only one who ever breaks in and helps with the sponsor read. Yeah. But you're exactly
[22:57.280 --> 23:02.640]  right. Well, Moltz will never do it. Moltz will sit there and text me while I'm doing it and he'll
[23:02.640 --> 23:07.440]  give me notes on how the sponsor read could be better, but he won't break in and say anything.
[23:08.080 --> 23:14.240]  Moltz won't say a goddamn word. He's the worst. I use this. I love it. I bought this dingus with
[23:14.240 --> 23:20.160]  my own goddamn money and we use it and I look at it and it's a, it is a terrific device.
[23:20.160 --> 23:29.040]  All right. Where do you go to find out more? Go to automatic.com slash the talk show automatic.com
[23:33.120 --> 23:40.480]  slash the talk show. There you go. There's the, the phenomes you need.
[23:44.320 --> 23:49.760]  My thanks to them. Great sponsor. I love them. I've got it plugged into my car. I've got the app
[23:49.760 --> 23:56.160]  and it honestly, it has gotten me to, to sort of take the lead foot off, off the gas pedal
[23:56.800 --> 24:00.240]  a little bit. Awesome. That's, that's, that's, that's so, it's so important. So did you ever
[24:00.240 --> 24:04.320]  get your, I mean, you probably shouldn't say no, I don't have a license. I have no license in six,
[24:04.320 --> 24:09.360]  six or seven years. The automatic becomes a kind of ad hoc license. Yeah. It's licensed to be safe.
[24:09.360 --> 24:15.440]  They can just run with that. Did you get my text? Right. My, my hope would be,
[24:15.440 --> 24:24.000]  did you get my text? Can I tweet it? Absolutely. Okay. My hope would be that the people,
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.320]  I mean, there's not that many people who listen to the show. My Pope would be that people are
[24:28.320 --> 24:35.520]  not going to report this to the Pennsylvania department of transportation. No, no.
[24:36.640 --> 24:43.040]  We'll keep it on the QT that I continue to drive without, without a valid PA driver's license.
[24:43.040 --> 24:49.760]  Yeah. Um, you know, I don't think that has to be a big deal. You know, if you're just like moving
[24:49.760 --> 24:53.440]  the car or let's say, you know, what if you have to go somewhere that's like important,
[24:53.440 --> 24:56.880]  should you need a license for that? No, I don't think so. Like what if it's a, what if it's a
[24:56.880 --> 24:59.440]  fairly short trip or better still, what if it's a very long trip where you're going to be on a
[24:59.440 --> 25:04.000]  highway and everybody knows highways are safer. Oh, very safe. I mean, you can fall asleep on the
[25:04.000 --> 25:09.680]  highway, right? I mean, that's where, I mean, people who have the Tesla's, they hit a button
[25:09.680 --> 25:19.520]  and you could just go to sleep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, oh boy. I got a catalog the other day. Just,
[25:19.520 --> 25:25.360]  just yesterday. I think it was, I got a catalog. I don't even know what I bought that put me on
[25:25.360 --> 25:31.200]  the list, but it came addressed to me. I got a catalog for a radio flyer. Now, you know,
[25:31.200 --> 25:35.760]  radio flyer, right? Oh, I got the same thing with the Tesla? With the Tesla. Yeah. What are we on?
[25:35.760 --> 25:42.720]  How did we get this? Uh, you know what? Maybe it's a show. I don't know. They send it, they send it
[25:42.720 --> 25:49.920]  to clicky keyboards, fussy coffee, fizzy water has podcast. They call, they call that an array.
[25:49.920 --> 25:55.760]  I got, I got a radio flyer catalog. We've gotten two of them with a, with a little,
[25:55.760 --> 26:07.920]  a delightful young boy riding in a Tesla, like a fake Tesla radio flyer. Uh, you know, wagon
[26:08.560 --> 26:15.520]  kids love Teslas. Well, I, and I thought about taking a picture of it and making a joke and I
[26:15.520 --> 26:19.360]  couldn't make a joke. I couldn't figure out the joke because it's like, what are you going to
[26:19.360 --> 26:24.960]  joke about? Like, uh, zero emissions. It's like self-driving. Yeah. It's like, uh, zero emissions
[26:24.960 --> 26:30.960]  is not, you know, it's not actually a joke. It's like, that's actually kind of cool. Yeah. I
[26:30.960 --> 26:35.840]  couldn't figure out the joke. We get a lot of catalogs, John. We get a lot of political things.
[26:35.840 --> 26:40.320]  We had, we had, I think it was, let me check here. A hundred and seventy five ballot initiatives.
[26:40.320 --> 26:47.680]  Uh, oh my God. John, John, the board of elections had to provide guidance on how to fold your
[26:47.680 --> 26:51.760]  ballot to put it in the envelope so that you didn't end up spending like $11 on postage.
[26:51.760 --> 26:55.360]  They had guidance on that. I think they had like a quick time movie to watch.
[26:59.040 --> 27:05.360]  Crazy days. We had two, we had two, we don't call them ballot initiatives here in Pennsylvania. We
[27:05.360 --> 27:10.720]  call them, I forget what we call them, but, uh, it's not like California, but we had two things
[27:10.720 --> 27:17.360]  to vote on that were sort of the, the, the sort of thing that I don't think you should be deciding
[27:17.360 --> 27:27.200]  by direct democracy. I think that this is exactly why we have a legislature. So one of them was,
[27:27.200 --> 27:32.960]  should we raise in Pennsylvania, like many States, a surprising number of States, if,
[27:32.960 --> 27:40.960]  if you just Google it, um, if you're a, uh, state judge, if you're, uh, uh, you know, you,
[27:40.960 --> 27:47.600]  you, when you, when you reach the age of 70, it's a mandatory retirement, you're out. And,
[27:47.600 --> 27:52.000]  and that's, that's probably, that's probably a pretty old law from the time when being 70 was
[27:52.000 --> 27:58.080]  kind of a big deal. It seems like it. And on, on the ballot was, uh, an initiative. I don't
[27:58.080 --> 28:05.200]  know what you call it, but whatever they call it here in PA, uh, to raise the age to 75. And,
[28:05.200 --> 28:11.680]  and we got, and I so that's so weirdly, just slightly less arbitrary, right? Like it's not
[28:11.680 --> 28:21.040]  to get rid of 76. Oh, okay. That'll fix it. Done. It's exactly what I thought when I saw it,
[28:21.040 --> 28:28.560]  it was like, you know, do you want to get rid of this age thing? Yes or no. I can kind of see that,
[28:28.560 --> 28:36.560]  but like 70 to 75, it's like, what, where do these numbers come from? But we got, we got a
[28:36.560 --> 28:40.960]  thing because we're registered. We happen to be registered Democrats. I don't think people are
[28:40.960 --> 28:46.480]  surprised to hear me say that. Huh? Interesting. But we got something from our local democratic
[28:46.480 --> 28:53.600]  ward with a, a suggested ballot. Like, here's how we think you should vote. You know, here's
[28:53.600 --> 29:01.520]  everything that's up, you know, here's who you should vote for. And, you know, I mean,
[29:01.520 --> 29:07.520]  it says like president, you know, you should vote for Hillary Clinton. Uh, you know, uh, Senator
[29:07.520 --> 29:12.240]  Katie McGinney, that's, you know, our Senator who is running against this dipshit, uh,
[29:12.240 --> 29:18.640]  Pat to me, uh, and, and so on as it goes down the ballot, but then it gets down to these ballot
[29:18.640 --> 29:25.760]  initiatives and we only had two and, and on the one that said, you know, should we raise the
[29:25.760 --> 29:34.560]  mandatory retirement age for judges from 70 to 75? It said, vote. No. In other words, don't raise
[29:34.560 --> 29:42.000]  the retirement age. It said, vote. No. Oh, that confusing language. Uh, it's already hard enough
[29:42.000 --> 29:50.160]  to get rid of bad judges. That's what it said. What? I swear to God, Merlin, am I making it up?
[29:51.040 --> 29:54.880]  Doesn't somebody have to approve these things? Do you just get to like paste it up and it just
[29:54.880 --> 30:02.480]  goes in whatever you have to say? Well, the next best thing was that the, the next question was,
[30:02.480 --> 30:10.800]  should the city of Philadelphia raise $185 million in debt to finance infrastructure improvements?
[30:10.800 --> 30:16.880]  And the answer on, on what, how should you vote? It was, it was blank.
[30:19.520 --> 30:23.920]  It was blank. Like you forgot to fill it in? I forgot to fill it in.
[30:23.920 --> 30:26.080]  Forget about it. Highways are for dicks.
[30:28.160 --> 30:33.200]  Oh gosh, we had a lot. Should people be allowed to sleep in tents on the sidewalk?
[30:33.200 --> 30:41.200]  Uh, I would vote. No, I would vote. No. It's very controversial. They don't have anywhere else to
[30:41.200 --> 30:45.440]  sleep. You go down to division street and it's, it's like a, it's like one long KOA under a
[30:45.440 --> 30:51.840]  highway. You got, uh, you got the, Oh, the grocery tax. What I think they should do. Here's what I
[30:51.840 --> 30:55.920]  think they should do. Yeah. Okay. You know, and we're trying to, just to be clear, we're trying
[30:55.920 --> 30:59.120]  to scoop everybody in here. We're going to miss a few people, but I think it's really important
[30:59.120 --> 31:04.400]  that we try to really find some answers. Um, I'm giving you an honest answer. Here's what I honestly
[31:04.400 --> 31:10.640]  think. I think they should drive buses, special buses around the city. And you find anybody
[31:10.640 --> 31:16.320]  sleeping on the sidewalk in a tent and you just scoop them up in the bus. And, and where do they
[31:16.320 --> 31:22.400]  go? Where do they go after that? Did you stay on the bus? Are they allowed to get off? They can get
[31:22.400 --> 31:25.920]  off wherever they want. This may be closer to what we see in the next four years than you think.
[31:25.920 --> 31:30.640]  Whenever they wake up, they can get off if they want. And it's going to be tremendous.
[31:31.440 --> 31:35.600]  They can get off wherever they want. Okay. But
[31:38.640 --> 31:42.080]  okay. I'm okay. So the bus comes along. They scoop up the 10 people.
[31:44.400 --> 31:49.040]  And I'll tell you what, this is an opinion that I would not have had if I haven't spent
[31:49.040 --> 31:56.640]  a lot of time in, uh, downtown San Francisco over the last 10 years. Yeah. But I'll just tell you
[31:56.640 --> 32:02.880]  that there are people sleeping on the sidewalks in San Francisco who, who make the city an unpleasant
[32:02.880 --> 32:08.080]  place to be. There are people living on this. It's important. These are not people who take a nap.
[32:08.080 --> 32:13.280]  This is people who do not have anywhere else to go. Yeah. And I, um, I, you know, we're, I'm, um,
[32:13.280 --> 32:19.440]  we're trying to have fun. I'm not trying to make light of, of, of, uh, desperate situation.
[32:19.440 --> 32:22.960]  But, but people already ride on the public transit, you know, you can ride on the public
[32:22.960 --> 32:27.680]  transit. You gotta, you gotta, uh, got a fairly comfortable place to be. Yeah. But, uh, you know,
[32:27.680 --> 32:32.960]  most of the, you know, what I'm suggesting though, would be a bus that has a, uh, toilet.
[32:33.520 --> 32:39.040]  Oh, nice. Okay. Okay. So you got, you basically, you've got, you've got like a stadium restroom
[32:39.040 --> 32:43.440]  on wheels. John wouldn't have shower facilities at all with maybe like a small library. Could you,
[32:43.440 --> 32:47.280]  could you get a La Croix? I would like all of those things. I would vote for all of them.
[32:47.280 --> 32:51.920]  You get a nice Google bus. I would vote for all of those things. I would vote for the shower
[32:51.920 --> 32:59.520]  facility. I would vote for the small library. Uh, and I would, honestly, I would vote for the, uh,
[33:00.240 --> 33:06.400]  tax increase that would pay for it. Honestly. I do feel like that would make for a better city.
[33:06.400 --> 33:11.840]  Better city. Hmm. Well, if you never find a house, you should come out here.
[33:13.600 --> 33:15.440]  Too soon? Too soon.
[33:21.440 --> 33:26.160]  There's an awful lot of people. And again, I'm not trying to rub it in anybody's face.
[33:26.160 --> 33:31.920]  I'm not trying to say who, who, you know, I voted for Hillary Clinton. I think a lot of people who
[33:31.920 --> 33:37.680]  listen to this probably voted for Hillary Clinton. I'm not trying to say she should have won. You
[33:37.680 --> 33:41.440]  know, I'm not trying to rub it in anybody's face if you voted for the other guy, but there's an
[33:41.440 --> 33:48.880]  awful lot of people who voted for Donald Trump, who I would really like for them to spend a day
[33:48.880 --> 33:59.120]  at like third and market in San Francisco. Yeah. Just stand on the corner for 12 hours.
[33:59.120 --> 34:04.880]  No, no, I, yeah, yeah. That, I mean, that kind of, I don't know, that, that gets that,
[34:05.680 --> 34:10.000]  that gets out a lot of the problem. Did you look at that? I'm going to have to go into this,
[34:10.000 --> 34:13.440]  but did you look at that Washington Post, uh, demographic breakdown?
[34:13.440 --> 34:18.320]  Yes, I did. Boy. Oh, this is going to be an interesting few years because basically,
[34:18.320 --> 34:22.080]  this is pretty cool. I don't know if I can find the link now. I sent it to you here.
[34:22.080 --> 34:26.080]  I got it. I got it. I'll put it in the show. But they, uh, yeah, they essentially,
[34:26.080 --> 34:29.760]  and I think these are exit polls, so I, you know, take it with a grain of salt,
[34:29.760 --> 34:36.080]  but basically they go in and do a full, um, demographic breakdown, you know, starting,
[34:36.080 --> 34:41.600]  starting with the basic numbers, but then going through, uh, gender, race, education, party, age.
[34:41.600 --> 34:45.760]  And I think it's a pretty good infographic, um, that really, it tells a hell of a story
[34:45.760 --> 34:54.000]  that I think many of us need to really digest. I love the fact that, so basically they've got a,
[34:54.000 --> 35:02.000]  um, like a, a line of like, so like you say, like, for example, uh, they say sex, I say gender
[35:02.000 --> 35:09.840]  because I'm woke. Um, so how many, what, what, what percentage voted blue? And then that's,
[35:09.840 --> 35:14.960]  and then I think that's reflected. So basically the area of the circle is based on the size of
[35:14.960 --> 35:18.720]  the demographic group and percentage of vote obtained. So you actually get kind of three
[35:18.720 --> 35:24.080]  different, very interesting data points. You get the, who did what you get the, how that went, and
[35:24.080 --> 35:30.720]  then you get the, like, what percentage of the total amount do they represent? And they're in
[35:30.720 --> 35:40.960]  is quite a story. I, it, it, it, it's a fascinating thing to scroll through because I, I, it, there's
[35:40.960 --> 35:50.720]  these, it, it works on a couple of dimensions where the circles are the size of the group.
[35:52.320 --> 35:57.760]  So like the total like number, like the per capita, like how many people are involved, right?
[35:57.760 --> 36:03.920]  Right. It's like, you see how far apart the two groups are, but the size of these circles lets
[36:03.920 --> 36:12.880]  you know, well, you know what I mean? Like, uh, uh, sex men versus women. Yeah. Well, the groups
[36:12.880 --> 36:20.240]  are obviously humongous because you know, it's almost everybody is either a man or a woman
[36:20.240 --> 36:29.280]  and the race one where it's, you know, how did white people vote? How did black people vote?
[36:29.280 --> 36:38.800]  It shows you how many of the people who actually voted are white or black or Hispanic,
[36:38.800 --> 36:45.200]  et cetera, et cetera. And so you hear these numbers, like you hear that, uh, you know,
[36:45.200 --> 36:49.680]  here's the numbers for the, this is from the page you're saying, and we'll put it in the show notes,
[36:49.680 --> 36:59.920]  but the black vote went 88% to the Democrats, 8% to Donald Trump, 2% to, uh,
[37:00.720 --> 37:06.480]  Gary dingus or whatever his name is. Yeah. But the size of that circle lets you know,
[37:06.480 --> 37:12.240]  ain't that big, right? You say like 88 to eight. Well, holy hell, that's a blowout. And then you
[37:12.240 --> 37:20.240]  see the size of the circle pie is always around. I mean, uh, it's, uh, it's a really interesting,
[37:20.240 --> 37:29.680]  uh, infographic in my opinion, it, it explains the election in a way that feels true to me.
[37:29.680 --> 37:36.000]  And it not, obviously not in a way that is like true, like, Oh, this is the truth I want to hear
[37:36.000 --> 37:41.680]  because the election did not turn out the way that I wanted. But sometimes when I get real worked up,
[37:41.680 --> 37:45.680]  I take pictures of my TV. And so I just sent you an image from last night at the great state of
[37:45.680 --> 37:50.400]  Pennsylvania in which you live. And at the point this was taken, uh, I don't know if you got that
[37:50.400 --> 37:54.800]  in your messages. I got a time. This was look at, look at that breakdown. So they're breaking down
[37:54.800 --> 38:02.000]  vote voting for the two parties. Um, presidential candidates by city suburbs and rural city,
[38:02.000 --> 38:14.240]  73, 24 Clinton suburbs, 48% dead, even rural, 72% Trump. Yep. And that's, I remember, I remember
[38:14.240 --> 38:21.200]  all the way back to 1992 and it was, I mean, how old was I then? Jesus Christ. I was only,
[38:21.200 --> 38:27.840]  uh, Jesus Christ. It was at the first, I think that was the first election I could vote in.
[38:27.840 --> 38:35.680]  Yeah. Oh, wow. Uh, I was like, you know, freshmen in college, but I remember hearing
[38:35.680 --> 38:42.080]  James Carville on TV and at the time, James Carville was like the, the, the horse whisper
[38:42.080 --> 38:46.640]  and Bill Clinton's ear, you know, like, yeah. You know, he's the guy telling them what to do.
[38:46.640 --> 38:53.520]  And James Carville described Pennsylvania as a Philadelphia on one side, Pittsburgh on the other
[38:53.520 --> 39:01.200]  and Alabama in the middle. And as a lifelong Pennsylvanian, I was like, oh yeah, that's
[39:01.200 --> 39:08.000]  exactly right. And as, and as a college kid who had just moved from that sort of Alabama middle
[39:08.000 --> 39:14.080]  to one of the cities on the, one of the sides of the state, I was like, yeah, that's exactly right.
[39:14.080 --> 39:18.400]  That is totally right. Scott Simpson always used to say the same thing. He comes from a very rural
[39:18.400 --> 39:23.680]  community would say he felt absolutely no allegiance to either of those two cities coming
[39:23.680 --> 39:30.480]  from the middle. I believe Scott is from Lancaster or near Lancaster. I should remember. He was in a
[39:30.480 --> 39:40.240]  Christian rock band. Company of praise. If not Lancaster, it's close enough. And it is everybody
[39:40.240 --> 39:45.040]  I know from Pennsylvania. And it's actually one of those things where it's like, it doesn't matter
[39:45.040 --> 39:49.360]  if you're a Democrat or Republican, you, you hear that and you're like, oh yeah, yeah, that sounds
[39:49.360 --> 39:55.360]  right. Right. It doesn't, even if you're like pro-Trump, if you're the guy, you know, somebody
[39:55.360 --> 39:59.440]  from Pennsylvania who voted for Trump, you're like, yeah, that sounds right. It's, you know,
[39:59.440 --> 40:08.720]  dirty liberals on Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and good people in the middle. Right. And it's
[40:08.720 --> 40:16.960]  absolutely striking. It's, you know, the picture you just sent me is amazing. There was that time
[40:16.960 --> 40:24.320]  last night where it was trying to do the translation on time, but it was, I'm past my
[40:24.320 --> 40:28.880]  daughter's bedtime, but it was at the point of like, oh, oh, you know, what I should not have
[40:28.880 --> 40:34.960]  been looking at is that stupid New York Times little speedometer thing. That was the death of
[40:34.960 --> 40:42.000]  me. It really was for me too. It was Clinton. It was Clinton. It was Clinton. I'll say some names,
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.400]  I guess, but it was Clinton 82 for a really long time. Then it's like, it's on a little bit and
[40:46.400 --> 40:51.360]  you get to 50, 50, what? And by the time it was getting up at one point, then it said greater than
[40:51.360 --> 40:57.200]  95 for the Republican candidate. And that was around the time when, so I was going back and
[40:57.200 --> 41:05.600]  forth between CNN and CBS because CBS has John Dickerson who is flatly the best. He was so good
[41:05.600 --> 41:11.520]  on that show. I wish, you know what, in hindsight, honestly, it wouldn't change the result, which,
[41:11.520 --> 41:16.480]  you know, obviously is the only thing that really matters. But in hindsight, I wish that I had CBS
[41:16.480 --> 41:24.080]  on. I watched MSNBC. Okay. You know what? And that was the worst decision I could have made.
[41:24.080 --> 41:28.800]  Because they were, was there a happy talk about how it would be okay?
[41:28.800 --> 41:38.000]  No, it was more like, I don't know. It was something about the attitude they were taking
[41:38.000 --> 41:45.840]  to the results that really got me. What I really want was just a total pro who didn't have,
[41:45.840 --> 41:52.000]  you know, I'll bet. I didn't watch CBS, but, you know, I'll bet John Dickerson was exactly
[41:52.000 --> 41:56.480]  right. It was a pretty good crew, but when I would flip back and forth and sometimes CBS would go to
[41:56.480 --> 42:00.160]  local coverage and I was like, please don't tell me about legal marijuana. I need to see what's
[42:00.160 --> 42:06.960]  happening with this national race. So I'd hop over to CNN. And it seems like, by the way, you guys
[42:06.960 --> 42:12.000]  can have your marijuana now. Congratulations. You can have your 420s. Right. The people in
[42:12.000 --> 42:20.160]  New Jersey. It was like, we're having the most important, in my opinion, the most important
[42:20.160 --> 42:27.680]  presidential election in our lifetimes. And then half of the time was spent on, do the people in
[42:27.680 --> 42:33.440]  New Jersey get medical marijuana? Well, okay. So one nice thing is I think they're finally getting
[42:33.440 --> 42:36.880]  their hands around how to deal with those giant touch screens. That's still kind of funny to watch
[42:36.880 --> 42:42.160]  them struggle with. Oh my God. On MSNBC, it was horrible. They keep hitting the wrong thing.
[42:43.120 --> 42:48.240]  No. And the guy kept complaining about it on air. He was like, God damn this machine.
[42:48.240 --> 42:53.280]  I don't think they get time to practice nearly as much. If you go see your local PERT happily
[42:54.240 --> 42:59.200]  doing the weather report, that is a person who has been dealing with a green screen and understands
[42:59.200 --> 43:02.480]  how to gesture their arms. In this case, they're flying all over the place. But it was the point in
[43:02.480 --> 43:08.240]  the evening when they got to where it was like, okay, well, this is how it's looking. And this is
[43:08.240 --> 43:16.240]  right before it went to Florida pretty conclusively. But he's going in and I almost
[43:16.240 --> 43:19.840]  felt like it was all he could do to not say, oh, there's still a chance. But he kept zooming
[43:19.840 --> 43:24.240]  way in on Broward and saying, well, we know this could still be Broward and zooming in further and
[43:24.240 --> 43:28.720]  then saying, and then you compare that to 2012. And then you go back to, he kept going to these
[43:28.720 --> 43:34.080]  two counties in Michigan and kept saying, no, Detroit, the story could still be Detroit.
[43:34.080 --> 43:37.440]  There could be like 150,000 people in Detroit that show up in a minute and we're all going,
[43:37.440 --> 43:44.320]  yeah, yeah, that could be it. Hey, Detroit seems cool. That was a little bit of the MSNBC
[43:44.320 --> 43:50.720]  experience too. It was almost, yeah, that's sort of a mirror. Because, I mean, like across the
[43:50.720 --> 43:54.080]  board and I'm sure we're eventually going to get to our friend from South by Southwest.
[43:54.080 --> 44:05.120]  But there was a little bit of this sort of, we're watching it and we came into it
[44:05.120 --> 44:11.440]  optimistic. We really did, I mean, and I don't think we were unrealistic. Everybody
[44:11.440 --> 44:16.080]  sort of expected a Hillary Clinton win. We went into it.
[44:16.080 --> 44:19.760]  Well, they at least expected something within a normal range, but it was like you went into
[44:19.760 --> 44:24.080]  your kitchen to make cupcakes and it kept producing monitor lizards. You kept going,
[44:24.080 --> 44:28.400]  I don't even understand what's happening in here. And I think they're struggling with it because
[44:28.400 --> 44:34.160]  they're going, they can't just say, what the fuck is going on here? What the fuck? You can't say
[44:34.160 --> 44:38.080]  that on the TV. So they've got to go like, well, Detroit could really, there could be a
[44:38.080 --> 44:46.640]  heck of a lot of underperforming with get out the vote news alert.
[44:46.640 --> 44:58.560]  That is so true. I honestly think that, again, I'm laughing because I am a white male with a
[44:58.560 --> 45:11.360]  job. So, I can afford to laugh, but I'm crying on the inside because I really do think that I'm not
[45:11.360 --> 45:18.320]  making light of this election. I don't think that's coming across. I hope so. I just want to
[45:18.320 --> 45:24.320]  double emphasize it as many times as I can, but I really do think watching it live last night,
[45:24.320 --> 45:35.040]  there was this sort of like, we can't say what the fuck. So therefore, because we can't say
[45:35.040 --> 45:38.960]  what the fuck, we're going to say stuff that doesn't make any sense, where they're going to
[45:38.960 --> 45:43.440]  say, we have to utilize these other words that are in the parlance for our business that don't
[45:43.440 --> 45:48.960]  get even near how what the fucky this is. And so they were saying things like, hey,
[45:48.960 --> 45:57.120]  Hillary Clinton is down by 300,000 votes in Florida, but she might make up 80,000 votes in
[45:57.120 --> 46:05.760]  Broward County. And you're like, wait, you just said she's down by 300,000 and she maybe, if
[46:05.760 --> 46:13.440]  everything goes right in Broward County, might make up 80,000. You realize that's not even close
[46:13.440 --> 46:17.040]  to making up the difference. No, it's just magical thinking. Everybody goes, well, you know,
[46:17.040 --> 46:20.480]  Wisconsin still isn't all the way in and they don't even bother to go to Wisconsin because
[46:20.480 --> 46:24.160]  that's so in the bag. It's not even going to be a problem. Right. And I would turn to Amy and I
[46:24.160 --> 46:29.840]  would say, am I mishearing this? This doesn't make any sense. And by the time I turned to her,
[46:30.800 --> 46:35.360]  I would look and then all of a sudden they're talking about Wisconsin. And it's like, wait,
[46:35.360 --> 46:43.440]  wait, put that manic guy with the glasses back on and have him explain to me how making up
[46:43.440 --> 46:52.080]  80,000 votes in this, you know, doesn't that? And they were on MSNBC, they were going through
[46:52.080 --> 46:57.520]  these contortions about, you know, what they can call and when they can call it and whatever. And
[46:57.520 --> 47:05.040]  I was like saying to Amy, I was like, wait a minute, if you're saying she is down by 300,000
[47:06.000 --> 47:13.360]  and the most she can make up is 80,000, what in the world is the difference where you can say,
[47:13.360 --> 47:18.720]  we can call this? And I'm like, just call it. Just fucking call the goddamn thing.
[47:19.440 --> 47:25.280]  You know what I mean? And here we are 24 hours later, we've got these results. We see the results,
[47:25.280 --> 47:32.400]  you know, and she didn't win for it. Why couldn't they call it when she was definitively,
[47:32.400 --> 47:37.280]  like best case scenario, down by 220,000 votes? I don't understand that.
[47:39.280 --> 47:42.560]  There's this other phenomenon. And like when you're a little kid, I have to tell you,
[47:42.560 --> 47:46.640]  I just remember we might've talked about this before talking about TV, but I always hated
[47:46.640 --> 47:51.120]  election nights as a kid. It was so boring. All the shows got preempted and then your parents
[47:51.120 --> 47:54.720]  would sit there and watch this incredibly boring thing. And you'd hear about like who your new
[47:54.720 --> 47:59.920]  alderman is. Yay. Like where's happy days. Fucking bring it. And so, you know, I knew this was
[47:59.920 --> 48:03.520]  excruciating for my daughter, but I was like, you know, I think we've kind of, we've told you,
[48:03.520 --> 48:07.920]  this is a pretty big deal and we're, I won't get too personal, but like we had a lot of personal
[48:07.920 --> 48:12.560]  stake. All three of us had a lot of personal stake in this. Yes. Even my nine-year-old daughter,
[48:12.560 --> 48:18.400]  maybe especially my nine-year-old daughter had a lot of stake in this. And so that made it really
[48:18.400 --> 48:23.840]  difficult. But there's, you learn as you get a little bit older, like when you first see the map,
[48:23.840 --> 48:29.040]  when you're a little kid, you go, what, like, oh, Texas. Well, Texas is a big state and it's
[48:29.040 --> 48:32.000]  a big deal because there are a lot of electoral votes. But you know, all those little states you
[48:32.000 --> 48:35.840]  see running down the side because they're too small to identify, some of those end up being
[48:35.840 --> 48:41.600]  really important. In other words, the amount of red or blue on the map, you learn to like,
[48:41.600 --> 48:46.400]  look at the numbers rather than the pretty colors because that's the story, right? You know what
[48:46.400 --> 48:52.480]  I'm saying? Like a smart person understands that you can, for example, as recently as 2016,
[48:52.480 --> 48:57.840]  you can win the most votes and still not win the election because that's not how the electoral
[48:57.840 --> 49:00.880]  college works. And my kid understood that. My wife and I understand that. So, you know,
[49:00.880 --> 49:07.040]  you start seeing more and more of the red pop up and then they go to somewhere like Michigan. And
[49:07.040 --> 49:12.400]  all of a sudden I felt like I was seven years old again. I was like, there is so much red on there.
[49:12.400 --> 49:17.520]  And they keep zooming in on these two or three little blue areas. But like, it was very profound
[49:17.520 --> 49:23.280]  to me to then have to undo that idea because the colors were not lining up, the shapes were not
[49:23.280 --> 49:30.720]  lining up, and the numbers were not lining up. And that was, I mean, that's why I want to locate this
[49:30.720 --> 49:36.080]  a little bit in last night, because over the period of about 90 minutes, the world started
[49:36.080 --> 49:42.480]  to feel a little bit different, and at least a little bit different. And then it started to feel
[49:42.480 --> 49:54.160]  different, faster and faster. And my breath was taken away at several points. I mean, we're three
[49:54.160 --> 49:59.120]  hours time shifted from you. But we were watching the same thing at the same time. And that is
[49:59.120 --> 50:08.640]  exactly how I felt. Exactly. Exactly. I couldn't put it any better. Especially, and again,
[50:08.640 --> 50:14.240]  like you were saying with these county by county results in Michigan, you know, I was just like,
[50:14.800 --> 50:23.680]  what the, you know, how can this be? How can we, how can we, how can Hillary Clinton possibly win
[50:23.680 --> 50:32.640]  looking at this? Right. But also some 2015 part of your brain is spinning, because the 2015 part
[50:32.640 --> 50:37.200]  of your brain goes, well, even if there's three people in that county, how did three people in
[50:37.200 --> 50:41.600]  that county choose to vote for the Republican candidate? In my 2015 line, which I still have,
[50:41.600 --> 50:46.160]  that's still a big part of my brain is, and that's, and again, now I have a different mind
[50:46.160 --> 50:51.440]  today, but that was part of the cognitive dissonance for me was even like looking at
[50:51.440 --> 50:55.840]  straight numbers and having, having my iPad pro sideways with multiple tabs open plus the
[50:55.840 --> 50:59.920]  side screen and like, like an idiot, like a monster, I'm looking at all of this data and
[50:59.920 --> 51:02.800]  then drilling down. And New York Times actually had pretty good coverage on this, where you could
[51:02.800 --> 51:08.000]  go in and like drill down into specific areas and see for yourself what was going on. And you could
[51:08.000 --> 51:11.760]  just look at the numbers. And the other thing we told our kid, and I think this is a good thing,
[51:11.760 --> 51:15.600]  is like, understand this is a multivariate thing. Like there's a certain number of electoral votes
[51:15.600 --> 51:19.440]  in that state. The state is comprised of counties. Each of those counties are reporting in different
[51:19.440 --> 51:24.800]  ways and at different times. And shame on CNN for the amount of like 1% reporting special news
[51:24.800 --> 51:29.120]  alerts that they had. It was so gross, but you can go in and this, this is a thing that happened
[51:29.120 --> 51:34.640]  though. And I guess this happens to everybody when their side is not winning, is that you start
[51:34.640 --> 51:39.760]  seeing that number go up and you see 60% reporting, you see 70% reporting and you start wondering
[51:39.760 --> 51:45.040]  how many more votes really could be there in a box somewhere in Portland that will pull this out.
[51:45.040 --> 51:50.480]  And then like you're describing, you're describing, I think you're very, very aptly describing that
[51:50.480 --> 51:57.440]  feeling of, oh my God, just say it. Because I see it. I see it. I don't believe it. I see it.
[51:57.440 --> 52:01.120]  Why aren't you just saying it? Because, oh my God, another one just turned red. Why is someone not
[52:01.120 --> 52:05.680]  saying what's really happening here? And I really, in my heart, believe that at least some, I know
[52:05.680 --> 52:13.520]  they're trying to be journalistically canny and trying to be fair and trying to not freak out.
[52:13.520 --> 52:17.840]  But I honestly, I would bet you, I bet you were going to hear a lot about a lot of things. And
[52:17.840 --> 52:24.240]  I bet one of the things we're going to hear is how many people just can't believe what happened on
[52:25.120 --> 52:32.720]  numerous levels. The failures or shortcomings of everything from our own perception to how
[52:32.720 --> 52:37.360]  we learn about what people think to how we choose to believe anybody else could see the world. I
[52:37.360 --> 52:42.240]  mean, I feel like, I don't know. I feel like I've just come out of a cult or something and I'm just
[52:42.240 --> 52:45.600]  like, I don't know what I even think anymore. I mean, I know what I think. I know how I feel.
[52:45.600 --> 52:51.120]  I'm here to talk to you about how I feel. But like, I don't know what to trust about my brain
[52:51.120 --> 52:56.160]  anymore. It was very frustrating, I thought last night. Because I really wanted, what I want is
[52:56.160 --> 53:04.000]  somebody who is like, somebody who knows as much shit about the goddamn new MacBook Pros as I do.
[53:04.640 --> 53:09.760]  I want them, somebody who knows that much about the elections to tell me what the hell is going
[53:09.760 --> 53:15.440]  on. And I felt like I wasn't getting it. You know, I mean, I felt like I was getting people
[53:15.440 --> 53:22.880]  who were as loosely informed as I was going like, I don't know, this seems kind of crazy. This is
[53:22.880 --> 53:29.840]  unexpected. It's like, I'm looking at the numbers on screen. And I'm thinking like, why won't
[53:29.840 --> 53:36.640]  somebody just tell me Florida is already lost? Like it was at the point. It was it was at least
[53:36.640 --> 53:42.320]  two hours after the point where me as a non-expert was looking at Florida's numbers and thinking,
[53:42.960 --> 53:49.040]  this is gone before they said, okay, Florida is in the Trump column. And I'm like,
[53:49.040 --> 53:57.920]  why? Why did that take two hours? That's crazy. So the two, you can actually see this in my Safari,
[53:57.920 --> 54:02.880]  the two things that it says, do you want to visit this site on your iPad? The two of those have been
[54:02.880 --> 54:07.760]  FiveThirtyEight and the Upshot. The Upshot has done a really, really good job of graphically
[54:07.760 --> 54:13.040]  displaying whatever information they had. And you know, don't yell at them. They're just reporting
[54:13.040 --> 54:17.840]  the polls. But one of my favorite things to look at, because it's very interesting, is the how
[54:17.840 --> 54:24.000]  other forecasts compare area, which I'm sure you've seen. So this has not been updated since
[54:24.000 --> 54:31.680]  yesterday. But as of yesterday, New York Times, 85% Democrat. FiveThirtyEight, the very conservative
[54:31.680 --> 54:35.600]  FiveThirtyEight, you know, really in context, they were very conservative compared to the others.
[54:35.600 --> 54:42.480]  They got a lot of heat, 71%. Huffington Post, 98% Democratic. PW, I'm not sure what that is,
[54:42.480 --> 54:50.880]  89%. PEC, greater than 99%. Oh, that's the Princeton election something.
[54:50.880 --> 55:01.520]  Okay. PW is PredictWise. So FiveThirtyEight was the most pessimistic with 71%.
[55:01.520 --> 55:06.960]  The Princeton Election Committee, or whatever the hell they're called. I love the guy. And
[55:06.960 --> 55:13.200]  I'm not doubting the statistical math behind the projection. But that was how I slept
[55:13.200 --> 55:22.000]  the last few nights. Oh, my God. Also, they use WordPress.
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.640]  Do you have anything else you want to tell me about today? Anything you like?
[55:26.960 --> 55:33.520]  Should we talk about these buttons on the keyboards? Sure, sure. At this happy point,
[55:33.520 --> 55:37.440]  I thought you might want to wedge in another sponsor visit. I'll help with the sponsor.
[55:37.440 --> 55:41.840]  I will tell you. I'm going to tell you. This is a new sponsor. First time sponsor on the show.
[55:41.840 --> 55:47.760]  This is a great... And I love it because I love... I don't know if you know this or not. I spend
[55:47.760 --> 55:56.480]  about 180 days a year at Disney World. I love Disney. And for the first time ever, Disney
[55:56.480 --> 56:01.840]  is sponsoring the show. Oh, that's so nice. That must have taken a long time to work out.
[56:01.840 --> 56:06.160]  Have you heard this, though? This might be new to you. You might not have even heard about this,
[56:06.160 --> 56:12.880]  Merlin. It's called Circle. Circle with Disney. You're not kidding me. I'm not kidding you. I
[56:12.880 --> 56:18.800]  am not kidding you. This is an actual sponsor. It really is Disney. It's a device called Circle.
[56:19.520 --> 56:27.520]  And it's a little dingus. I swear to God. It is a little dingus. It looks like the
[56:27.520 --> 56:32.880]  power adapter that comes with your iPhone. Exactly. You plug this into your house.
[56:32.880 --> 56:43.440]  It pairs with any Wi-Fi router that you might want. And what you can do is set up a thing
[56:43.440 --> 56:48.400]  so that if you have kids, your kids, you can manage their internet access.
[56:49.440 --> 56:59.040]  Oh, my God. This is so boss. It's $99, one-time cost. But if you use the code TheTalkShow,
[56:59.040 --> 57:06.960]  don't forget the TheTalkShow. You'll save 10 bucks. It's only $89. And you can get this
[57:06.960 --> 57:13.600]  one-time cost. You can get Circle Go, which is like a service. You can get it for $10 a month,
[57:13.600 --> 57:22.160]  $9.95, for up to 10 devices. But it's only for iOS. It's super easy to set up.
[57:23.440 --> 57:28.320]  There's nothing worse than setting up a complicated networking device. I mean,
[57:28.320 --> 57:33.440]  I mean, I've done it. John, that's table stakes nowadays. If you want to penetrate the market,
[57:33.440 --> 57:38.880]  as you like to say, you're going to have to come out with a device that has as little fiddly,
[57:38.880 --> 57:42.800]  you know, save the fiddly stuff for your coffee. Let's Circle manage your content for you. You
[57:42.800 --> 57:46.800]  know what I'm saying? Exactly. If you're going to spend a lot of time on something, it might as
[57:46.800 --> 57:53.120]  well be making your coffee. Circle with Disney lets parents filter content, customize what's
[57:53.120 --> 58:01.200]  available, customize the time that kids can be on the internet. It's amazing. Kids staying up late
[58:01.200 --> 58:06.000]  on their tablet. Circle with Disney lets you set a bedtime for each kid on each device.
[58:07.040 --> 58:13.600]  What about 4G? Because you think like, hey, you know what I mean? I'll shut off the Wi-Fi. My
[58:13.600 --> 58:23.520]  kid will just hop on the LG. Everybody, you know, they know that your kids already have probably,
[58:24.640 --> 58:31.040]  especially if they're teenage years, they already have a smartphone and they already have that.
[58:31.040 --> 58:38.160]  So that's why they make Circle Go. Circle Go, Disney Circle Go, takes all the settings on your
[58:38.160 --> 58:45.200]  kids' devices and lets you configure them with your Circle with Disney. What? I swear to God,
[58:45.200 --> 58:50.080]  I don't even know how that works. Is it an MDM? Like how does that work? It's Disney Magic.
[58:50.080 --> 58:57.840]  John, it's Disney Magic. Disney Magic. Disney Magic. So here you go. Go to, if you've got kids
[58:57.840 --> 59:04.080]  and you want to manage their access to the internet on your Wi-Fi, remember the code,

[59:33.360 --> 59:39.760]  super easy. They sent me one. I did. I sent it up. It is super easy to set up. I mean, my kid
[59:39.760 --> 59:47.440]  actually like is, you know, just between me and you. Yeah. Maybe sort of, you know, not the
[59:47.440 --> 59:53.440]  sharpest tech in the room because he like, I don't think he actually like tries to go to anything
[59:53.440 --> 59:58.720]  that we wouldn't approve of. Hmm. Doesn't it disappoint you a little bit? A little bit because
[59:58.720 --> 01:00:02.480]  I know... Don't you want to be a little bit more ambitious? Yeah, a little bit. I would think that
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:10.240]  he would. But so, you know, like we're not really, you know, it's like we set it up and it was like
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:15.040]  super easy to set up. They sent me the thing. I set it up and it's like, do we really need this?
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:19.520]  I don't know because it seems to me like our kid just like comes to us and it's like,
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:24.720]  hey, can I, you know, is it okay if I search Google for blah, blah, blah? Wow. But you know
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:30.320]  what? Belts and suspenders. Have a good kid and get yourself a circle. Exactly. That's what I
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:36.160]  thought. Exactly. Good deal. Couldn't be easier to set up. It's a beautiful little device. So
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:44.480]  go to meet circle, meet circle.com and remember the code, the talk show. You will save 10 bucks
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:50.640]  and get free shipping. There you go. Just for what it's worth. For now,
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:01:02.160]  it appears that meet circle.com with an a is available. You know what? I'm just going to go
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:06.320]  there as a man from San Francisco. I'm here to tell you if there was a website called meet
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:12.720]  circle with an a about circles of meat, I got a pretty, pretty good feeling that meet circle
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.240]  with two E's would not let you see it. I could have sworn that was the name of the restaurant
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:24.480]  where we went the last time I was out there. Meet circle. You know what? That would,
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:28.320]  I mean, that, that, that is actually, I mean, we're making a joke, but it actually is not a
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:33.520]  bad name for, not bad at all. Think about, think about those touristy, uh, sushi places you go
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:37.520]  where it arrives on a boat and they just count your plates. Like what if there was a rotating,
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:43.440]  a rotating, uh, let's call it a carousel, a carne carousel. Like you've got, you've got a meat,
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:49.440]  a meats, a spinning meat, a lazy Susan. Yeah. Right. And you could just try all different
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:52.320]  things. It would be, it would be kind of like going to like a Brazilian steakhouse
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:58.320]  technology. Yeah. I think people would love that meat circle. I kind of gobble that up.
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:03.440]  All right. And at the Brazilian steakhouse, but the, the ones I've been to, we've got two here
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:08.720]  in Philly. We've got a focused show and we've got, uh, I forget what the other one's called.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:16.880]  The other one's better endorsement from junk endorsement.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.400]  Yeah, we've got one here. They, uh, it's costly. Um, but it's, it's a lot of fun. If you go at
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:28.560]  lunch, you don't get as many varieties. No, no. The lunch, you get screwed.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:34.080]  They got chicken hearts. They got chicken hearts at lunch. They desperately want you to come in
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:39.680]  at lunch. And would you like more chicken heart? Yeah. Corazon de Pollo. Yes. I know
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:45.520]  that Spanish, but still we're like, we're good. We're good. How about some more of that, uh,
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:48.720]  tri-tip? Yeah. Yeah. You maybe you try the chicken heart. It's on a sword.
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:56.720]  I think you'll find it quite toothsome. And the tiny little sausages. I love the little sausages.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:02.000]  I like the salty. My favorite I think is the straight up like salty sirloin. All right. I,
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:08.080]  uh, the, the other one here in Philadelphia is called Chima. Chima. That's the good one.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:15.280]  Uh, focused shout is a little, I don't know, little, let me be able to say you saved like
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:19.840]  five bucks on the, uh, you know, there's always like an all you can eat type deal. You don't want
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:25.200]  to, you don't want to be buying meat on price, right? Yeah. Chima is the good one. But for
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:30.800]  anybody who hasn't been to one of these places, the both of them, at least here, and I've been to
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:35.600]  focus show, you know, it's going to be funny because it might come up again later in the show
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:42.800]  in Austin, Texas. I've been to focus. You meet a lot of interesting people. You meet a lot,
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:49.760]  a lot of interesting people. You came in, but it's the same field though, where you get,
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:56.080]  you go into this place and there's these, you know, the Cowboys walking around who,
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:01.120]  who grilled the steak and you have like a little, uh, they give everybody a little,
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:06.960]  a little thing like red light, green light, you know, right. Yeah. More steak, less steak,
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:13.200]  red and green, right? So green, green steak. If you put it up green side up, the guy comes,
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:17.760]  if the guy's coming around with whatever kind of steak he's made, he'll say, Hey, do you want some?
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.880]  And you say, you know, they usually ask you, but if you have it on green, they are not legally
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:27.360]  obligated to ask. Right. They might just give it to you. Right. That's, that's, that's the law.
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:30.880]  That's the law of Rio. It's called from the Magna Carta. They can come right up and put whatever
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:34.800]  meat suits them on your plate and you have to eat it and, and, and they don't, they don't have to,
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:37.440]  they don't have to ask that. You don't have to say your thank you. They're just going to literally
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:41.520]  keep bringing meat until you can get your swollen greasy fingers to change it to avocado.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:45.760]  That's true. That is the law of the Brazilian steak house.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:52.240]  But if you put the other lies, don't fill up on salad. That's the second law,
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:56.240]  second law of the Brazilian steak house, because to a that's how they get you.
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:59.440]  That's how they get you. They want you to fill up on potato salad and shit.
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:02.560]  Don't do that. Cause they're going to bring you a bunch of chicken hearts.
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:09.520]  And they always have, it's always a, a, everyone. And it doesn't matter what the name of the, the,
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:15.440]  the steak house is. If it's a Brazilian steak house, it's always a salad bar where you can go up
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:20.640]  and go hog wild on the salad. They might have, ours has a hot bar to ours is called
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:24.800]  Espadis. And boy, is it ever good. It's not, what's your skull book at a pepper,
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:29.520]  pepper to book. Oh, what's your skull. We got two. We got, we got, we got
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:35.680]  four going to shower and we got chima. And that's what it is. They got, they got a really nice salad
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:39.840]  bar of some unconventional salad, some non-traditional salads, and they got a hot
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:43.520]  bar. So if you want black beans and white rice, not a problem. You can go up there and get yourself
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:48.320]  kind of some a fakie paella. It's, it's really good by the bathroom. Just wash your hands,
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:52.160]  come out, get a plate. But that's, that's rule number two, rule number two of steakhouse club
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.760]  is you don't, don't fill up and help bread. They're going to give you the cheesy bread.
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:00.240]  Fuck that. Rule number three, a Brazilian steakhouse do not fill up on the fucking,
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:06.400]  I'm talking to you, daughter, big glass of milk. That's for meat. Don't fill up on that.
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:11.680]  And the cheesy bread is good. That's it is good, but that's how they get you. That's three a
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:20.000]  it's so true. It's really disappointing that there's a reason why at like a regular steakhouse
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:27.120]  where, where I mean regular, meaning you don't get unlimited red light, green light meat,
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:35.840]  that they don't also have a, just eat as much as you want at the salad bar salad bar.
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:44.560]  Exactly. Right. It's, you know, it is true. You know, you said that's how they get you and,
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:51.520]  and that is for, I think for me and you, that's how they get you is sort of a catchphrase of
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:57.200]  like our parents' generation would tell us like that's, they would explain the way the system
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:01.760]  works. That's the single greatest piece of conventional wisdom for everybody, uh, older
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:06.880]  than me. You're going to, you're going to seven 11. Oh, you're going to get one of those big
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:10.880]  gulps. Oh, how much is that? It's a dollar. You know what that costs? A nickel. That's how they
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:15.040]  get you. Is that right? Is that right? Japanese car, Japanese car. That's how they get you.
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:18.400]  I remember somebody telling me that like, when you went to seven 11,
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.880]  that you had to be careful how much ice you put in the cup.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  Right. That no matter what size cup you got, they'd fill it up with ice and you'd get the
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:37.280]  same amount of soda. Even if you got the 64 ounce, which is bullshit, like a 64 ounce soda is, is an
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:43.760]  enormous amount of soda. But there were people who told me in my youth that, that that's how they get
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:47.840]  you. It's like the secret menu for cheapskates. It's like the things that you can get away with.
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:51.040]  Hey, you know, listen, so you know, when you go to this place, you can ask for extra rolls
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:57.920]  to take home and they have to give it to you. So we used to run a restaurant and when I was a kid
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:01.520]  and it would be the same people who are very unhappy every weekend would come in and they
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:05.680]  came there to be unhappy together and they would come in and they would, the same people complain
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:09.520]  about the same things every time. There was one couple that always came in, always got the same
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:13.840]  really crappy deuce right by the bar. And then they would complain about the noise in the bar.
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.520]  And then they would steal literally everything off the table. Every week they would take all
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:21.040]  of the silverware. They would take all of the salt and pepper shakers. They would take the sweet and
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.080]  low. They would take the sugar. They would take the flour arrangement and then we'd have them
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:32.640]  back the next week. And that was just the thing we did. Florida. I'm having a hard day, John. I
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:38.240]  got to be honest with you. I'm having a hard day. You know what? I don't know who else would do this
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:44.080]  with me, Merlin. Honestly. Well, we were not going to scoop up every single person, but you know,
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:47.760]  I think it's good that we're here. It's good we're here to talk about this. All right. So
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:54.320]  Amy and I, you know this. You know this. Maybe people who listen to the show don't know this.
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:09:01.440]  My wife, Amy and I, people maybe know her on Twitter. She's at Amy Jane. But we literally
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:07.200]  were in the same kindergarten class together. We were in school together from kindergarten
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:13.280]  all the way through 12th grade. Then we were separated for the college years.
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:21.120]  We somehow made it work. And here we are. Now we're married and we're on Twitter.
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:30.320]  We're married on Twitter. But we've often said, though, it is an amazing thing that we spent our
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:37.120]  teenage years together. Because we can tell stories about our teenage years and instead
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:43.360]  of like, oh my God, just blacking out, rolling your eyes because you're a significant other,
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:49.760]  your partner is talking about, you know, being 14 years old. You're like, oh my God,
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:56.400]  I remember that. And you're like, I was there. And yes, that is true. So we were
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:06.000]  where we grew up. Everybody was a member. It was a public pool. It was public. But you had to pay,
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.440]  like your family had to pay like 100 bucks a year to get in or something like that. So it
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:16.080]  wasn't like you could just show up. But everybody was a member. You'd get like a special badge.
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:21.200]  Every year they'd put out like a new color badge and you'd sew it on your swimsuit. So
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:24.960]  when you showed up at the pool, they could see that you were a paid member.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:33.600]  And as a teenager, every day, every single day in the summer, what I would do is I would wake up,
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:39.840]  I would go play basketball because I was an avid basketball player. I would play basketball from
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:45.840]  like, I don't know, 11 a.m. till one in the afternoon. And it would just when it got just
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:51.600]  too goddamn hot to keep playing basketball, we would head over to the pool. And that's where we
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:11:02.400]  would go. And at the pool, there was a snack bar and the snack bar sold, you know, like Reese's
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:10.960]  Peanut Butter Cups, Swedish Fish, and the entire selection of food offerings for Reese's Peanut
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:18.160]  Butter Cups, Swedish Fish, which were a penny apiece. And they'd count them out. It would take
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:27.200]  forever. One, two, three. Three Swedish Fish. Go back to the pool with you. And wait a half hour
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:32.720]  before you go back in. And they had a soda fountain. And here's a long story short. At
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:39.200]  some point in my teenage years, somebody convinced me that they were screwing me over by filling my
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:44.960]  cup up with ice. Because that's how they get you. Yeah, that's how they get you. So I would go over
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:54.000]  and get my, I would say like, give me a Dr. Pepper, no ice. I'll never see that coming.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:02.720]  Two points. I have two points to make on this. Number one. Warm Dr. Pepper tastes like shit.
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:10.720]  It is horrible. It really is. The pruniness really comes out.
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:14.800]  You don't realize how pruney Dr. Pepper is until you have it at room temperature.
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:19.680]  And number two. It tastes like some kind of a 19th century elixir.
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:23.440]  This is the point. But you're going to love this, Merlin. You're going to love it.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:29.280]  About two or three weeks after I started ordering my sodas, no ice, and my friends were doing the
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:35.600]  same. It wasn't just me. It was a bunch of us. They changed their policy. And if you ordered
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:47.280]  your soda, no ice, they only filled it to one inch below the cup. Wow. So if you said, because
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:55.280]  of portion control. Right. And we would say, like, give me a large Dr. Pepper, no ice. And
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:13:00.480]  they'd only fill it an inch below the rim. And then you'd be like, well, wait, that's not filled.
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:06.880]  And they'd be like, well, that's where the ice would go. It's like one of those bars with the
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:13.520]  robot dispensers. You know what I mean? There's some bars now where when you get a drink, it's
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:17.680]  like the robot does it. It tells you this is exactly whatever, an ounce or half an ounce or
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:23.840]  whatever. Oh, it's sickening. My God. And they got you again. That's how they got you a second time.
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:31.120]  Well, you know what? The thing is, in hindsight, one reaffirms the other, where on the one hand,
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:36.960]  it tasted terrible because it wasn't cold. But on the other hand, the fact that they started
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:44.320]  screwing you on how much soda, it reaffirmed the initial reason why you did it, which was this is
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:49.200]  how they get you. Because if it wasn't how they got you, why would they be screwing you on how
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:56.960]  much soda they put in the cup? Right? Absolutely. Absolutely. The system always wins. The system
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:02.160]  always wins. And you know what? This is honestly how we wound up with President Trump. I mean,
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:08.720]  honestly, why I think you draw if you can, you blame the system. If you connect the dots,
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:22.080]  I would say that like 1987 at the Antietam pool, a no ice Dr. Pepper only being filled
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:30.560]  one inch below the rim, dot, dot, dot. Here you go. 2016. President Trump. Do you agree?
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:33.840]  When they finally, oh, well, it makes perfect sense. I think it's a clear line. I mean,
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:37.200]  I don't even think it's that way. I see it. I mean, and this is like, I'm thinking of like
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:40.640]  any kind of a, you know, document, not a documentary, but a docudrama. Like you do
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:44.480]  something like, and the band played on. And the band played on is about the AIDS epidemic,
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:49.840]  but it begins with Matthew Modine dealing with the Ebola. And that sets us up for all the
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:53.040]  flashbacks. He says, you know, Paul McCartney walks by, sees a bass in the window. Oh,
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:57.280]  one day I'll be playing that at the Cavern Club. You know, as you know, Bob, this is what I end up
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:03.920]  doing. Right. And so in this case, a young, a young John Gruber hot from basketball 11 to one
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:08.800]  every day, he wants to take a dip by 3 cents for the Swedish fish and have himself a refreshing
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:14.320]  cup of Dr. Pepper. And, uh, and now, now, now today everybody's at school crying.
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:19.680]  All right. And yeah, you put it that way and I do, I see it now.
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:23.120]  It's it's, I think it's a direct line. Yeah.
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:32.640]  How did everybody get so this is going to be in God. So, you know, I was telling you,
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:38.800]  I was listening to all these podcasts. Usually I'm getting six podcasts a day in the run up to this.
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:43.840]  And boy, it was like radio silence this morning. There was one NPR, uh, politics episode. I think
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:50.400]  they recorded last night. There was a pretty short, what was the other one? 1600 finally came
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:58.560]  out, but so far today, uh, no culture gab Fest. Maybe John's busy. No, no Trump cast. Uh, still
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:03.120]  haven't heard election profit makers. It's been like a real cricket, cricket serpent.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.120]  I mean, I don't know how many of those things you listen to, but I mean, I, I I'm sitting there,
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:12.560]  flip it, flip it, flip it at like, come on overcast. Let me, let me experience my emotions.
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:16.160]  As my hippie girlfriend used to say, I want to experience my emotions. I want to walk
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:24.400]  through this. I, I, I, again, I'm, I'm being more jovial than usual. And quite frankly,
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:31.520]  what's the holiday season? Right. Quite frankly, I might be without taking another sip of any
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:36.080]  beverage. I might be drunk for the next 72 hours based on how much I drank last night.
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:41.200]  So, you know, you gave yourself a contact. Well, it's, it's, you know,
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:47.520]  yeah, no, I mean, it's table stakes. Let's just face it. It's a complicated time for sure. I
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:54.880]  think it might be enjoyable, but here is what I thought I, I really did. Uh, uh, I'm going to be
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:17:00.240]  deadly serious here. And again, a political, it doesn't matter which side you're on, but there
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:07.600]  was a moment yesterday, uh, let's say 24 hours ago. And, and as we record, you know, no results
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:13.280]  were in. So it wasn't even like, Oh, it looks bad for her. It looks good for him or whatever.
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:21.760]  24 hours ago, I thought, you know what? I should have done a show by now. I should have had a new
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:26.080]  episode. I, you know, I don't have a regular schedule. I don't record on a regular schedule.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:32.640]  And the reason I didn't record a show is I thought I can't, I'm so distracted by this
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:37.440]  election. I don't want to do a show because it's all I can think about. And I realized
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:44.640]  in hindsight, I should have done a show, not for myself, but because, Hey, I'll bet tens of
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:49.680]  thousands of people who listen to my show would love to just distract themselves with me talking
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:55.680]  about the goddamn key travel on a new Mac book pro like, absolutely right. Like two hours of
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:04.160]  me talking about what it's like to type on the new Mac book pro in, in my mind was like, well,
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:09.040]  what a waste of fucking time. But in hindsight, I thought like, Oh, that would have been actually
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:14.320]  would have been great for the people who love the stuff that I do. And I should have done it.
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:18.720]  And then I woke up today and I thought, well, now I've got to get Merlin.
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:26.240]  Yeah, it's no, I mean, basically it's been a really weird morning. And my only thought was,
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:31.280]  like I said, in the text to you, my only plan for this entire day was to try to stay sane and clean
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:37.360]  the shit out of the car. My whole plan for today was to like my wife bike to work today. And I was
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:41.680]  like, so, um, how about I clean the car today? And she's like, yeah, that's fine. So I go out there.
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:46.000]  I got the vinegar. I got the baking soda. I got the mini vac. I got the big vac. I'm taking it
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.840]  all out, taking the whole thing apart. And I'm just, I'm scrubbing it like a crazy person. Cause
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:54.880]  I need to control a small area. I did that yesterday. I Merlin, I swear to God, you can,
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:19:01.920]  I mean, seriously go DMR right now. You can DM Amy yesterday, the holiday party too. Oh,
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:08.320]  no, she's actually, uh, she probably will be soon, but she's not at the holiday party yet.
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:12.560]  You know, the reason you didn't get an invitation is because you asked for an invite.
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:15.440]  If you ask for an invite, you don't get an invitation. You know that I,
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:20.320]  I, you know, my feelings on invites. That's rule number five of Brazilian steakhouse.
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:24.400]  You can never get it, but there is no invite. It's not a word.
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:32.400]  Stop saying that yesterday. I swear to God, you could, you could, I swear to God,
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:40.080]  DMR and find out you clean the car. No, I, what I did is I've, I've vacuumed in their dining room
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:50.960]  and our kid, our kid, he, he loves to eat. He loves corn chips. He eats a lot of, uh, tacos.
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:57.760]  He, he, you know, but he, he has, he dislikes corn chips and there's just, there was just a ton
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:04.320]  of ground up corn chips underneath our dining room table. And I thought, well, what better?
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:08.880]  Why not now? Let's get, somebody's got to get these corn chips. Somebody's got to get them.
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:19.120]  And my wife came down and it is, let's, I mean, shocker 99 times out of a hundred when somebody,
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:25.200]  you know, vacuums up the corn chips. It's my wife, not me. And my wife is like,
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:28.960]  what the fuck are you doing? Oh, I cleaned the shit out of our dishes last night.
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:33.680]  I cleaned dishes I didn't need to clean. I, I, I cleaned the cast iron pan twice. And then this
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:38.320]  is a life hack. Uh, you can use kosher salt and you can rub it around in there without,
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:42.160]  without harming it. You don't want to put soap in there. So I did that a couple of times with
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:48.960]  the kosher salt and, uh, they still kept turning red. Stopped at one point to watch a Parks and
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:53.920]  Recreation, uh, because my, my daughter was on the verge. And so we watched a very good
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:21:00.240]  relevant episode of Parks and Rec where she, uh, she narrowly wins the election, uh, because it's
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:06.480]  an educational program for a nine-year-old. We got to talk about, we got to, we got to talk a
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:11.520]  little bit about, uh, about, don't you think a little bit about the, what we got wrong? Don't
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:15.680]  you think? I mean, is that too much? Is that too deep? We could talk about the keyboard. You know,
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:19.280]  I'm not using my DOS cause I'm on the podcast, but I could type on my DOS if that would help.
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:24.160]  No, I think we should. I think we should talk about what we got wrong. That's an amazing key travel.
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:29.840]  Listen to this. Listen to this. Let's see. Oh, that sounds good. You want to talk about key
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:38.480]  travel? Oh, that sounds good. Sixth rule of Brazilian steakhouse. Wow. That,
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.120]  I mean, honestly, that is... I don't know what kind of cherry that is. That could be cherry,
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:46.560]  blue cherry, brown. I don't know. I'd have to have Jason listen. You know, Jason types very fast.
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:50.960]  For two or three seconds there, I've completely forgot about this election.
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:58.800]  We can talk about it. I have seen, you know, I, it seems so relevant. I have photos. That's
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:02.800]  all very interesting, but I'll be dissatisfied with the butterfly switches on my computer.
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:11.760]  I have photographed myself like taking a, you know, as the kids, the kids call them a selfie
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:16.080]  with Jason. And yesterday I watched a video of you using an escape key. Yeah.
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:22.560]  Huh? Does anybody care? No? Okay. Huh? You know what? I had to, I had to delete that tweet.
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:29.920]  Oh, yeah. Oh, because it's a loner. Oh yeah. Well, and, and it turns out the embargo is,
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:36.800]  it's not enough. Oh man. The embargo still counts even today. I'm so... Doesn't it seem ludicrous
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:40.640]  that anybody is doing anything today? Doesn't it seem crazy that anybody is at work? That's
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:48.720]  exactly what I thought yesterday. What I, I, it turns so long story short, I, I tweeted a video
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:58.000]  of me using an escape key on a Mac book pro and the embargo is not up on those Mac book pros,
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:06.160]  but on the ones that have like the physical keys, it is up. And I, I, I just, it was yesterday and
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:11.040]  I was so, I was just like, wouldn't it be, you know what I mean? Like this is what I was thinking.
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:20.080]  I was like, yeah, why not obsess over the escape key? Absolutely. I would love to spend the next
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:27.040]  four years thinking about escape keys. Uh, I, it just seems like wake me up four years from now
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:34.560]  when, when the next election is over and I'll spend the entire between now and then just
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:39.120]  dealing with escape keys. Even our friend, our friend Marco even said, Hey, you know,
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:44.160]  I would get into sports if I could get that back. Oh, I've gotten two emails today. Um,
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:48.800]  one email was a 2FA to get into my Apple on the web when you sent me the notes for this.
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:53.040]  And the other one was somebody who just sent me an email today and I was like, what the fuck?
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:58.640]  You sent me an email today? Who sends a fucking email the day after the election? It felt,
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:01.680]  I mean, it's the way we used to feel about Christmas. It would be like, some is it would
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:05.760]  be like a, it'd be like having like a vacuum salesman at your house on Christmas morning.
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:10.800]  You'd be like, why, what are you doing? Don't you live in civil society? You don't send somebody
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:16.560]  an email on a day like today. What are you thinking? How did you, how did that even cross
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:21.040]  your mind to do that? I'm just, I'm sending texts to my friends and saying, are you okay?
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:25.280]  That's what I've been doing all morning is texting my friends to say, are you okay?
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:32.720]  The sun never even came out here. We, we actually have had, we've had about 36 hours of
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:38.240]  complete darkness that, I mean, that might even making that up. It's actually been a very dreary
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:44.080]  day. Yeah, you did go red. Yeah. And yeah, the amazing thing. And I thought, well, this is a
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:50.960]  good sign is yesterday election day. It was beautiful. It was 62 and sunny. It was a good
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:56.000]  sign. What a great sign. Not a cloud in the skies. Everything's coming up Milhouse. Yeah.
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:01.760]  This is going to be, I'm going to walk away with it. This is all
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:08.640]  to return to that because I just need to vent a little more is like, even at last night,
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:14.400]  and even when it got bad, and even when the needle moved past the 50%, that 2015 part of my brain
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:22.080]  said, calm the fuck down. It's there's no, there's no way. I mean, how late was it before? How late
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:26.480]  was it before you started to flip? And then how long did it take for you to really say, Oh, shit.
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:31.040]  That's a good point. That's a very good question. There are plenty of chances and you expected
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:38.320]  they'll go back and forth. This is how it works. Electoral. You know what? I, I started to feel
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:46.880]  really bad in my stomach when it took so long to call Virginia, because I, I Florida, you're okay
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:52.240]  with Florida. Cause you realize big state places and time zones like there's a lot going on in
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:26:01.600]  Florida. And I, I am, I'm enough of a political nerd where I kind of, I, I there's, you know,
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:07.200]  I do feel like this election flipped a lot of the conventional wisdom, but the conventional wisdom
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:19.280]  is based still basically true. And it, you know, Virginia being so long was like a really bad sign.
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:24.000]  So she, you know, Hillary Clinton ended up winning Virginia, but the fact that it took so long to
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:30.080]  call it was really where it, it, it is. So I would say at least on the East coast, it's not
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:36.640]  say at least on the East coast time, it was around, I don't know, around 10 o'clock. So
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:41.840]  probably seven o'clock your time where I just thought the fact that they're not willing to
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:50.640]  call Virginia is a really bad sign. Yeah. I think I started to really get to fear a little before
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:54.080]  that last night, you know, how you do the benefits, like where if you go and buy this restaurant,
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:27:00.800]  school gets money, we try to do this. So girls went out to go get some poke at the poke place,
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:07.040]  poke bowl. And they were gone for a while. And like, they came back in and I was like,
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:14.960]  this is not good. It was, it was a situation where like, I, you know, I follow this enough to know,
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:17.920]  okay, here's the battleground states. I don't, I don't need an infographic to understand the
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:21.920]  importance of that. Being somebody who's followed this more closely than I would ever admit in
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:26.080]  public until today, I knew that there's a handful of places that are going to make a difference.
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:29.440]  Right. Anyway, I explained this with my kid. I mean, yeah, California's got a lot of electoral
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:33.120]  votes, but what's the, what is it they say about companies that's, that's, you know,
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:37.920]  they picked into the price or built into the price. We go into this knowing that there's a
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:41.280]  really good chance. I mean, there's a way beyond good chance that California is going to go this
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:45.760]  way. There's a very good, there's a, you know, again, a very good chance that say Utah is going
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:49.840]  to go this way, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So you really focus on, it's like, we're not going
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:52.640]  to worry about the ponds. We're going to worry about the row that's right in front of us here.
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:58.800]  These are the big things. And it really, I kept going, okay, you know, ha ha, here we go. I'm not
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:03.520]  going to have a drink. This is going to be fine. And I just kept thinking, okay, this is time for
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:10.080]  a few of these to go from white to blue. And I kept thinking, there's really, really feels like
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:14.800]  it's really time for some of these to go from white to blue to like, well, this seems quite
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:20.160]  irregular. Why are more of these not flipping to blue? And that's where I got to the headspace
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:27.120]  you're in, where you're like, what is taking so long? We thought that was going to be one of the
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:33.120]  firewall states. Like what happened with that? And I bet that along with a lot of other people
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:38.560]  watching this, that's probably around the time where you, we had the WTF, maybe a loud moment
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:43.200]  of going like, you know, what if this is something, I don't say fundamentally different because it
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:46.640]  isn't like it started as an election and turned into a tennis game. It was an election that ended
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:52.080]  as an election. But at the same time, there are so many things that we thought to some level of
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:56.000]  certainty we understood about this. And I have to just, I mean, I'm sorry to keep coming back to
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:02.400]  this, but this is just where my emotions and my mind are today is I'm still stunned. I'm just,
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:07.440]  I'm still stunned with how much I did not understand about what was happening. And then
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:11.600]  you go and you look at the polls and you go and you look at the reporting on all of this. And I
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:16.960]  think it's probably about five times worse for a journalist today. You know what I mean? Like,
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:21.200]  listen to these folks, just sit and listen to the NPR podcast this morning. And they're just like,
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:26.080]  yeah, this is real different than anything we had imagined could happen.
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:31.440]  And so what we've done, we rule, do we rule out? I mean, just to get this out of the way,
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:36.960]  because there's certainly some part of your brain that goes, huh, it's weird. Like if I were going
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:40.720]  to make a program that affected the elections, if I were going to do some kind of an exploit,
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:44.320]  I would make it look close for a while and then win by a little bit. Like you're a gambler,
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:48.720]  right? But are we ruling that out? Do we feel like that's, that's probably not,
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:52.080]  I just want to get it out of the way so we can move on. But yeah, I don't think there was
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:57.840]  meddling. I kind of do. No, I don't. I don't think so. I think it's a totally legit election.
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:05.040]  And that's the problem. There was a period between, I would say between like eight and
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:14.000]  10 Eastern time last night. Like we, we, we had MSNBC on before eight, but eight is really when
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.800]  we, you know, we, we, that's just when real results, that's when polls start closing and
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:24.560]  you start being able to say something, right? So from eight to 10, I was kind of rolling my eyes
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:32.160]  and, and I kind of felt like MSNBC was sandbagging it, like to make it look close. There was like,
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:35.360]  they're like, they're sandbagging is a great word for it. They're like, they're milking this. This
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:38.880]  is their last chance. They need to make this seem like a horse race up to the end. And then
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:42.320]  there was, I kept saying every, everyone kept saying how close it was. That was the
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:47.280]  watchword of the night. This is so much closer than anybody thought. And, and there was,
[01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:55.200]  there was an interchange between, uh, Rachel Maddow and, uh, uh, what's the guy's name. He's
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:31:05.120]  the, the, the guy who got fired from the big seat at NBC. Uh, Oh, Tom Brokaw. No, but he got demoted,
[01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:11.920]  not fired, but demoted. Oh, Brian Williams. That's it. Yeah. Uh, there was an exchange between Brian
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:19.440]  Williams and Rachel Maddow where they, they, they kind of went meta and they were like,
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:26.320]  we're not fucking with you. We, you know, honest to God, this is as up in the air as,
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:33.040]  as we're making it seem. And it was right around that, that 10 o'clock at night moment where,
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:38.160]  where, you know, where I thought like the fact that they're not willing to call Virginia yet
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:43.760]  is like, this is something that's going on. And I, you know, that's where I thought,
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:49.520]  Hey, this isn't just, you know, the TV, you know, they're, they're not just playing this for ratings.
[01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:55.600]  Right, right. Uh, yeah, I felt something similar and I, CBS did a really good job. I mean,
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:58.240]  didn't love every single one of the folks on, I think they could have done with fewer than
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:03.520]  six people and just let Dickerson talk more, but it was, it was a very good group, but I,
[01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:08.000]  I felt a similar thing at a lot of what I was looking at. And that's when we were talking
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:12.480]  earlier about the, you know, screaming WTF. I don't know why I'm suddenly so precious about
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:19.040]  language, but, but there, there, there did get to be this feeling that you're describing of almost
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:23.840]  like, like we need to break the fourth wall for a minute here. Like we all understand that there's
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:31.040]  a performance, a performance aspect to this. Um, I mean, a polling site is going to get less traffic
[01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:41.920]  if it's a solid, uh, 85, 14 for a year, if it's a pretty solid 85, 14 for a year, that's not going
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:45.440]  to get as much traffic as something where those numbers are changing around. So we get cynical
[01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:48.080]  about that. We understand clickbait and all that kind of stuff, but now I agree with you. I think
[01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:53.520]  there was a certain point or maybe I was just inferring this, uh, with my own increasingly
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:58.000]  frazzled, uh, mentality, but, uh, it really felt like they, like they were struggling
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:04.080]  with it too. And so we're avoiding getting, getting to this, but like, you know, the polls,
[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:09.920]  um, who everybody, you know, and like you, you go listen to anybody we, I told you in text today,
[01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:13.440]  like I've been listening to the FiveThirtyEight podcast and, you know, between Nate and Harry,
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:17.760]  they're always trying to say like tamp down this like irrational exuberance about what this means
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:23.440]  and like constantly, you know, Nate got burned pretty bad on Trump because at one point he said,
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:28.080]  he's now famous for saying that he thought Trump, I can't believe I'm saying his name, had a less
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:33.280]  than 20% chance of becoming the GOP candidate. And that really came back to bite him. And I think he
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:37.520]  clamped down super hard with the model. And listen to that show all along, how they developed the
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:43.360]  model, updates the model, what's happening with the model. But, um, I think they have all along
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:49.600]  been trying to tamp that down, but I'm, I had this really sick feeling where I, I want to hear this,
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:53.440]  but I don't want to hear this. I want to hear what they have to say because they were the most
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:34:01.200]  conservative and it was still so I sat, you know, and I haven't seen a side by side yet. I have not
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:09.440]  seen a side by side on how it turned out versus what each polling site, um, modeled, but that's
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:14.480]  going to be a hell of a story. Like what parts of that broke down and how did I break down? I mean,
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:18.560]  I'd like to think of myself as an empathetic person. I'm fond of quoting, uh, that old,
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:22.880]  uh, that old Renoir movie and saying everybody has their reasons. Like I, I think I'm a fairly
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:30.880]  empathetic person about this, but I did not realize how deep something was in this election,
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:35.760]  how deep some set of feelings, and I think there's a variety of feelings. I think just calling it
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:40.960]  racist or misogynistic is a little shortsighted. There's something maybe even deeper than that
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:49.840]  going on here. And I called that way wrong. Yeah. And it's, you know, it is clearly, I mean,
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:57.440]  you know, subtract white men and, and the election is a blowout for, for Hillary in the model,
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:04.240]  but a lot of white women came out. That's the crazy part there. Yeah. And it's weird. Like,
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:11.520]  what is the difference? Like why was the white, whether you're men or women angle
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:19.600]  so definitive here and not when the black guy was running the last two elections, you know what I
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:23.360]  mean? Like he, you know what I mean? Look at the margins, look at the margins, look at the margins
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:27.680]  in the, in the, God, listen to me. I fucking hate myself. I look at the margins in the battleground
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:34.080]  States, but look at the margins, the, the oh eight to 12 and the Hillary margins and Wilkes-Barre. I
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:37.440]  mean, I don't know if that's how you pronounce it, but that's one that Obama ran away with.
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:46.720]  Yeah. It's it, it well, Pennsylvania has gone blue since 92. I think it's crazy. It's really,
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:54.240]  really weird. And, and it's, you know, turnout was phenomenal in Philadelphia. You know, it was,
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:57.920]  you know, there were, you know, I don't know if what you were watching, you know, you said you
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:04.480]  were watching CBS and CNN, but on, on MSNBC, they kept cutting to Philadelphia and they were showing
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:08.960]  like crazy long lines, like North Carolina, North Carolina, you see a line where somebody
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:15.440]  takes their iPhone in portrait mode and walks along and you just see several hundred black
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:19.520]  people waiting to vote. And you're like, clearly part of this, when they, when they say like the
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:23.440]  whole percentage reporting, well, what if we don't know how many people have actually voted?
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:26.480]  Right. But then you kept going like, Oh, maybe, maybe this is really going to pull it out. Maybe
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:29.440]  North Carolina is going to be the one. I think what they're going to, you know,
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:35.120]  for whatever reason they're going to show, I think the results will show that the turnout in the
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:41.280]  middle of all these States where, you know, the rural areas that the, the turnout was just
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:53.520]  phenomenal and hasn't been even, you know, with, uh, you know, uh, you know, in the Obama election years, it,
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:58.480]  you know, for whatever reason, Trump turned these people out and it's, you know, I don't get it, but
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:03.680]  it's there. Um, I need to dash in a bit. Did you want to tell me about, uh, one more thing that
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:06.720]  you're excited about? I do want to tell you about, I'm very happy to help if I can.
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:10.480]  That's, that's, that's, that's the eighth rule. The eighth rule is there are no sixth and seventh
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:13.600]  rules of Brazilian steakhouse. The ninth rule is you help a buddy with a reed.
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:18.160]  Have you ever heard of God though? Oh, but God, though it's a new sponsor,
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:23.760]  a brand new company. Well, maybe you've heard of them. I don't know. You're juiced in. So maybe
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:26.320]  you've heard of them. Have you ever heard of a company called Squarespace?
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:32.400]  Squarespace? Is that with an S? With an S. Squarespace
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:40.400]  is, are you talking about the single best place to go to have a website,
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:45.600]  a portfolio or an online store? Yeah, that's exactly what I do. You know what? Yes, I do.
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:49.840]  I, I've heard of Squarespace. Yeah. Well, you're more juiced in than I am. I've never
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:52.880]  heard of this company. I'm a little more juiced in. Yeah. I've never heard of this company,
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:38:00.480]  but you can start building your own website today. Does it require a credit card?
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:07.040]  It does not. But if you use this code talk show that now they don't have the, the,
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:12.720]  it's just a talk show, but you'll get 10% off whatever level you end up signing up at.
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:21.520]  But you can sign up for free with no credit card. You could start literally,
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:24.640]  literally building your website today with Squarespace by going to squarespace.com.
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:28.560]  Is that what you're telling me? If you have any notion in your head for, hey,
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:37.200]  that should be a website. I can make a website that is blank and it could be like you said,
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:45.760]  a portfolio of your work. It could be a store where you sell the, the crap that you make.
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:55.760]  Yeah. Could be a blog, could be a podcast, could be anything. Yes. If you just start by going
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:03.040]  to squarespace.com, you are almost certainly will have an easier time doing it than if you do it
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:08.320]  in any other way. Uh, the site or any benefit, is there any benefit at all to signing up for a year?
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:16.080]  Uh, I think you get a free domain. If you get free domain name, sign up for your free domain.
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:19.520]  Are you looking at the, how are you looking at my screen? Yes.
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:26.640]  If I don't sign up for a year, like why did your home screen like that? If you sign up for your
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:33.200]  docs in the wrong place, you can get a free domain name. Uh, so literally they cover everything from
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:40.720]  registering the domain name to the layout of your site, the fonts, the style, the, you know,
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:45.840]  is it a portfolio site where you're showing the illustrations you make? Is it a store where you're
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:52.640]  selling t-shirts? Is it a blog? Is it a, all of that stuff you can set up visually. They have,
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:56.160]  I don't know, man, what if I'm, what if I'm a developer and I want to get my hands on the
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:59.680]  actual code? Is there any way they have any provision for that? Probably not. Cause it's,
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:02.160]  it's Squarespace, right? They wouldn't have anything like a platform for that. You would
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:06.400]  think that they wouldn't, you would think it's all just, you know, you got to click, click, click.
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:11.680]  But the truth is Merlin, this is amazing. If you want to get in there and like you, you want to
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:17.200]  like write your own JavaScript code and put it in there, you can do it. You actually do that right
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:21.440]  on the website. You can do that right in the website. You can just get in there and, and, uh,
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:26.240]  insert your own code. But the thing is with all of these sites, if I run into any kind of trouble,
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:31.040]  I'm on my own. Is that correct? If like, so let's say I run into some kind of trouble. Maybe,
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:37.120]  maybe I get confused. Maybe I, I, I, uh, I follow the wrong tutorial from John Sirquiuss's CPAN
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:40.480]  and I do my back backslash is the wrong way. Is there anybody that can help me? Probably not.
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:43.520]  You would, you know what, what if you got to, what if you got to, what they call it,
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:47.200]  a greedy enumerator. I would like to tell you it's accidentally eating your JavaScript. Is
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:50.640]  there anybody that you can call? I would like to tell you that, you know, I would like to say that
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:54.160]  you were correct because you're on the show and I don't want to embarrass you. I would like to say,
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:59.840]  yes, you've got to fix it yourself. The truth is though, they actually have 24 hour a day
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:06.400]  real time support. You just call them up and, and you can text, you can text them.
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:12.320]  Yeah, but they've got people, they've positioned them around the world. I literally,
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:16.000]  what if I want to talk to somebody in Portland? Is there anything that they can help me with?
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  Yeah, they're in Portland, they're in Ireland. They've positioned these people
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:25.680]  strategically around the world so that when you need tech support, if you need tech support,
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:31.920]  you can get somebody on the horn. It's like the Dr. Strange portals. They're protecting the globe
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:37.760]  with these three equal distant points and they put an entire web of support over the earth.
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:40.960]  And that keeps us away from Dormomomoo. Exactly.
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:43.920]  That's amazing. What's it called? What's the name of the service again?
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:48.160]  It's called Squarespace. And now I think they're going places. I think you're going to hear about
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:56.000]  them. I think I keep it in mind. If you have a notion for a website, go to squarespace.com.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:02.800]  Remember the code, talk show, know the, and you'll get 10% off. Honestly, you don't even need 10%
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:07.440]  off. Even if you forget the code, just go there and sign up. It's a great service.
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:11.840]  And there could be somebody in your life today who needs this site and they don't know it,
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:15.680]  but you do. That's the thing. You do not want to be in the webmaster business. You don't want
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:19.280]  to be making for your preschool, for your church group. You don't want to be doing that. You don't
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:23.440]  want to get out of that business where you've got to know the SSH login to be able to... No,
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:27.760]  you don't need to do that anymore. Tell your friends and your family about this site because
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:32.800]  it's perfect for somebody in your life. Yeah, that's actually, I mean, tongue in
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:39.760]  cheek on this whole thing where you are jumping in on this. That's actually probably the single
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:44.720]  best advice about Squarespace is that keep it in mind for people who don't listen to shows like
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:53.520]  the talk show because, exactly, if your kid's preschool or the church group or whatever needs
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:43:01.280]  a website, guaranteed that is a better idea than you jumping in and saying, oh yeah, I'll jump in
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:11.840]  and SSH in and start an index.html web site. Forget it. Just go to Squarespace and cut yourself
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:16.960]  out of it. Totally true. Cut yourself out of it. They just got to run with that, right?
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:27.040]  It's totally true though. What are we going to do? I think we're going to be okay.
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:32.800]  Yeah, I think we will too. I share your interest and obsession with the whole idea of story.
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:36.800]  So, I was talking about this. I'm doing a new show with a couple friends of mine. We were talking
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:42.880]  last week about that Steve Jobs lost interview that you can see on Netflix. And I was realizing,
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:45.440]  forgive me if you've heard this, if you're one of the five people who listen to that show,
[01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:50.000]  but I'm very interested in the idea of how Apple and Steve Jobs and Pixar are so interested in the
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:54.400]  idea of story, story about the company, story as a thing that we create. And I was trying to make
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:44:00.080]  the case that Apple also, if you accept the notion that story is an abstraction layer,
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:04.240]  their computers and their devices are stories too. They're taking out all of the
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:07.680]  essential things and telling a great story with the minimal number of components needed
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:11.760]  to tell the story correctly. So, I've been thinking a lot about story and now today I'm
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:19.760]  thinking more about story because I feel like with our president elect right now,
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:24.640]  you described something earlier. Well, is this a victory for him? Is it a victory for the party?
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:29.520]  Is it a defeat of the opposing party? It's hard to know right now, but the one thing I do feel that I
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:34.800]  need to learn more about before I try to do anything intelligent and rational is to understand
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:39.200]  what stories he told, whether they're true, whether they're good, whether they're accurate,
[01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:42.960]  whether they're kind, whether they're decent, whether they're respectful, whatever stories
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:46.720]  he's telling meant a lot to people. And I think different parts of that story meant things to
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:52.160]  different people. And a lot of the folks in those red states found a way to overlook one to five
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:57.440]  terrible things about him because there was something about that story that worked for them.
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:02.240]  And the failure of imagination for me, as I said here today, is that I don't think I got that story
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:05.680]  well enough. And I think like everybody else, I missed it. I don't know what's going to change
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:09.120]  as a result of that, but I don't know how I proceed to do anything intelligently until I
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:13.200]  understand what I got wrong. I don't want to point a finger. I don't want to yell at Jill
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:19.040]  Snide. I want to first understand like how I got it wrong. And I think I didn't get the story right.
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:31.440]  So I am of the opinion that in the 2000 election that you can yell at Ralph Nader,
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:38.720]  that Ralph Nader really fucked that one up. And you don't even want to get my way. You've probably
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:43.600]  heard her do it because that one is... She has a few hot button issues.
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:50.480]  She has a hot button issues, and Ralph Nader in 2000 is one of them, is that Ralph Nader really
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:59.600]  fucked that one up. And I don't feel like this is that at all. I'm with you. I don't have any
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:07.520]  animosity towards the third party candidates, towards Jill Stein or Joe Schenectady, whatever
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:10.080]  the guy's name is. Yeah, the pot guy, Joe Schenectady.
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:13.600]  Yeah, the guy who doesn't know where Aleppo is, you know what I mean?
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:15.760]  Aleppo is that Brazilian restaurant in Philadelphia.
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:17.680]  You know what? I think that's the third...
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:19.440]  That's the 12th rule of...
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:28.160]  Aleppo. If you yell Aleppo, you always get a fresh cut on the house sirloin.
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:29.680]  You like maybe a nice chicken heart?
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:30.180]  Yeah.
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:33.120]  Don't fill up on Aleppo.
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:36.880]  This isn't that at all. It's very different.
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:37.920]  Yeah.
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:50.560]  It's... I tweeted it. My id comes out on Twitter. I tweet a lot looser than I blog. And even on this
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:47:00.800]  show, I'm looser on Twitter than I am anywhere else. And I tweeted before... I think it was even
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:08.640]  before... Yeah, I think it was like two days ago, but where the Trump team had suggested
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:13.840]  that they're gonna appoint Rudy Giuliani as Attorney General and...
[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:18.880]  You could not put those announcements in Gingrich. You could not put that in Mad
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:20.240]  Magazine and have it be possible.
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:25.600]  And Newt Gingrich is Secretary of State. And maybe that's actually... At this point,
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:31.440]  maybe that's gonna come to pass. And like you said, it sounds like something out of Mad Magazine.
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:39.040]  But honest to God, at least there's a certain honesty to it. You know what I mean? I think
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:45.360]  it's preposterous. I don't agree with it. I think it's terrible. But at least they're saying,
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:53.760]  this is how bad it's gonna be. Or this is how... I say bad, but this is how...
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:55.520]  They're different.
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:57.600]  How different it's going to be.
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:02.000]  I think we can fairly say in a non-partisan way, things are gonna be a little different for a while.
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:08.240]  Yes, I do. I think that's exactly right. But there is...
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:11.760]  Did you see that video of Obama high-fiving a little kid dressed like Superman?
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:12.480]  Yeah.
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:18.960]  And then Superman high-fived him and he fell back. Like the force of that little
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:23.520]  five-year-old kid knocked him over. I don't think you're gonna get so much of that anymore.
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:24.560]  Yeah, not so much.
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:26.000]  I'm gonna really, really miss that guy.
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:32.320]  Sorry, I cut you off there.
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:34.800]  No, I don't know where I was going.
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:38.000]  You gotta edit this thing and put it out, Jon. This is gonna help a lot of people.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  That's exactly what I want is...
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.640]  I think you are probably one of the premier Brazilian steak
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:47.120]  podcasts that's available today. I don't know all of them. The thing is, we can't scoop up
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:50.240]  everybody. That's the thing. We're gonna leave some people out of the Brazilians' meats.
[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:54.080]  Have you ever had the fried banana at a Brazilian steakhouse?
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:55.600]  Shit, dog. Hell yeah.
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:01.600]  And here's what I thought the first time I went. I was like,
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:03.840]  well, I'm not eating a fried banana. That sounds disgusting.
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:06.320]  That's how they get you. That's how they get you.
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:06.960]  And that's how they get you.
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:08.000]  It's pretty damn good.
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:13.200]  It's really good. And next thing you know, you're asking your guy. The guy thinks you're
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:19.840]  asking for more of the top sirloin or the bottom sirloin. They've got 13 different cuts of steak.
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:21.920]  And the guy thinks you're going to ask for that. And you're like,
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:24.400]  no, bring us another fried banana.
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:27.360]  They should serve it on a sword, though. That would make it more fun.
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:28.000]  Yeah, they should.
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:29.120]  Banana sword.
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:35.600]  I think because, though, I think the problem is that it's going to fall right off the sword.
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:36.640]  It's going to cut right through it.
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:40.720]  I agree. Did you get the little tongs on the table when you go? I love little tongs.
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:42.240]  Oh, always. You got to get the tongs.
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:44.960]  Well, you get to participate a little bit. I don't think they have to do that,
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:48.160]  but I like the fact that they come most of the time and they give you this look. They go, huh?
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:50.880]  And you grab your little tongs and you help with the rest of the way.
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:53.920]  Right. They cut it about 80% of the way.
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:57.120]  And then you take your tongs and then they cut the rest of the way and you
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:49:59.600]  take your little slab of meat.
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:02.880]  No, not one Brazilian steak.
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:10.800]  I think America needs, I think that's what America needs. America needs a Brazilian steak.
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:13.280]  That's a really good way, but stronger together.
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:17.520]  Right. I think that's something we could all use. Do you feel like you're going to be okay?
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:21.520]  I mean, after the holiday party's over, but do you feel like...
[01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:25.520]  I know it's probably too early to feel anything too coherently, but
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:30.160]  anything you're thinking about going forward?
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:38.960]  All I keep thinking is I am upset. I've taken this very hard. I am politically
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:44.960]  very fascinated. I've said this before, but when I first started thinking I should start writing
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:51.360]  a blog, I had this name, Daring Fireball, in my pocket and I thought, should I write about
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:57.440]  Apple and tech stuff or should I write about politics? And it was like a 50-50 call for
[01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:03.760]  me in 2002. It really was. I really am that invested in this stuff.
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:05.520]  Or maybe sports. Did you ever consider sports?
[01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:09.120]  Sports is always up there.
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:11.760]  No, I'm not being facetious, I mean, did it cross your mind?
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:16.640]  I'm totally serious. It did, but not as much because I didn't feel like it was as underserved.
[01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:23.600]  I felt like politics and tech were underserved by smart commentary.
[01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:27.200]  Well, we both got lucky and different. Obviously, you were way more successful
[01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:32.880]  than I was at this, but we had good timing at figuring out a pie slice of a pie slice.
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:37.280]  Who would ever think somebody would want something about Mac productivity?
[01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:41.680]  Most people don't want a Mac site. Most people don't want a productivity site. Who would want
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:46.320]  a Mac productivity site? That's bananas. And in your case, there were not that many people
[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:50.080]  out there doing what you were doing. But sports is a little more.
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:52:05.440]  Totally true. But I will tell you, and like previous elections, again, I'm glad that Barack
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:12.400]  Obama won the last two. I was despondent in 2000 and 2004 when George W. Bush won.
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:29.680]  But this one, to me, I don't just feel like my side lost. I feel a guilt. You know what I mean?
[01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:39.280]  You and I are almost identically aged white men, straight white men with wives and a kid.
[01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:45.200]  And our kids are both roughly 10 years old. My kid's a little older. Yours is a little younger.
[01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:50.640]  We're almost the same guy. We really are. And we make our living on the internet.
[01:52:51.760 --> 01:53:00.240]  And we've got it good, right? There's no denying it. You and I have it really good.
[01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:12.800]  And I really do feel that at a basic level, it's not even my right to feel bad about this one,
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:22.400]  because it's my people who blew it. That's true. But there's another part of this. Part of what
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:27.120]  eats at me is that I have seen, and I agree with you, who needs two white guys talking about
[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:31.600]  anything, except I'm a white guy who was really pulling for a lot of stuff to change. Regardless
[01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:38.080]  of whatever applesauce my dick is in, there's some stuff that means a lot to me. And as I have had
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:42.480]  small and sometimes private little bits of evolution in how I think about the world,
[01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:47.920]  I got a little myopic in thinking that other people saw the same thing and that they could be
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:55.200]  thrilled and buoyed to see people who never had a chance to be normal American citizens before,
[01:53:55.200 --> 01:54:00.880]  get to do things in the last five years nobody could have expected. I mean, who saw the gay
[01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:04.320]  marriage thing coming along the way it did? Well, some people did, and then it happened.
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:08.480]  And you're like, how can you look at that and see anything but joy? The two people just got to be
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:12.000]  the person they want to be. America is where you get to be the person that you want to be.
[01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:17.360]  And that's the hard part. But I want to see even more, especially as a white guy, because no,
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:22.080]  I don't have the same... I'm certainly, I'm extremely privileged in so many ways.
[01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:27.280]  I get to go where I want to go and all that kind of stuff. But my little miniature journey
[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:31.680]  into understanding these little parts of America better, and getting to see those people have these
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:36.560]  exalted moments of victory after years of being told that they aren't an actual human being,
[01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:41.520]  to see so much of that progress in the last five years, and now see that in jeopardy,
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:44.080]  hurts my heart in a way that's difficult for me to communicate.
[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:54.800]  I feel exactly the same way. I can't say it better. This is why I'm glad you're on the
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:55:00.000]  show with me today. And I really hope that whatever side of the election people who
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:07.920]  are listening to this are on, that they can hear us and sympathize. I mean that.
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:17.360]  And in a way that... For example, I think my wife, if she were... I don't think she listens
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:25.360]  to the whole show. So I think she'd be furious if she heard me saying that I'm whichever side
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:29.520]  of the election you're on, because she thinks the people who voted the other way are shitbags.
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:33.120]  And she's not wrong. She's right. She's not wrong.
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:39.200]  Here's something I got schooled hard on by a friend of the show, John Siracusa. And we
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:44.080]  were talking about things having to do with the way that women get treated by everybody.
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:48.400]  And I found myself saying this thing that I don't say anymore. And this is less than a year ago. But
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:52.480]  I found myself saying, these people who are these gamergate guys, don't they realize that they're
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:58.720]  talking to somebody's sister or they're talking to somebody's daughter? And John, I think very
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:05.440]  intelligently said, hey, is that the hill you want to die on? You sure you want to put the importance
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:10.160]  of their humanity and rights in terms of how they relate to you? And I thought about it for months
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:13.760]  and months and months. And then I saw it happening a lot after the pussy grabbing. And I thought
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:18.720]  about it a lot. And now I think you have to want these things for people because they're people,
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:22.320]  not because they're people that you've decided are particularly empathetic based on your own
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:26.560]  feelings and needs. And that's where I think... I do feel comfortable as a white guy saying that
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:32.640]  this is a shit show, because I've gotten to see those victories. I see it in my kid's class. I
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:39.680]  see it in the girl in my kid's class wears a hijab. I mean, you see it. It is real. This is
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:45.920]  not an abstract thing about a wall. This is about actual human beings who have worked extremely hard
[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:52.320]  to make what they can here. And to see that potentially taken away in such a massive way,
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:59.600]  if that doesn't move you, you're not wired right. I saw a thing where just yesterday,
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:06.000]  somebody posted on Twitter, just a thousand of them. Maybe there's a thousand different
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:11.120]  pictures of the same thing. But somebody posted yesterday a picture of a white guy,
[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:19.360]  somewhere around 27 years old, white guy at a Trump rally the day before the election. And
[01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:28.080]  he was wearing a shirt that said, Hillary is a bitch, pound sign Trump. So black letters,
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:36.160]  Hillary is a bitch. And then the hashtag, it was in red, Trump. And somebody...
[01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:47.920]  The observation was, can you even imagine... How much worse is the misogyny that allows somebody
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:53.200]  to go out in public with a shirt like that? Because what would be the equivalent shirt
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:58:02.640]  against Obama? Nobody would go out wearing a shirt with the N word on it. I say nobody,
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:07.040]  but maybe in this country of 300 million, there's one guy who would do it. But
[01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:12.560]  this wasn't that abnormal. But you wouldn't have 46% of the population thinking it's okay.
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:19.840]  Right. Exactly. There is something very different. There's no cultural prohibition against that,
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:22.720]  that's pushing back to make him go, maybe this isn't such a good idea.
[01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:30.880]  And it makes me feel personally. And again, this was like 48 hours ago. This is before the results.
[01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:38.560]  But that one tweet and the guy wearing that shirt that said that, it just emphasizes how I feel
[01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:52.560]  like this whole time. I feel like I need to step backwards and let other people tell me what is
[01:58:52.560 --> 01:59:01.840]  going on rather than observe myself. Do you know what I mean? I do. You have to shut the fuck up
[01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:07.520]  at the times when somebody is telling you something you need to hear. And then increasingly,
[01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:12.320]  I'm coming around to the idea of how important it is to speak up when somebody's doing the opposite.
[01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:20.320]  Exactly. The only time I feel the need to speak up is to observe. For example, to say, it is to me,
[01:59:21.680 --> 01:59:29.440]  literally, I'm not exaggerating, unacceptable to wear a shirt that says Hillary is a bitch.
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:39.280]  It's completely unacceptable. It really, to me, is as unacceptable as saying Obama is the N-word.
[01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:50.320]  It's that equivalent. Yet, we're not there as a society. So I'm willing to stand up and say that.
[01:59:50.320 --> 02:00:01.360]  But in terms of how we got this election result, I just feel like, I don't know.
[02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:03.920]  I don't know either.
[02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:13.440]  I tell you what, the other thing too, and I think we're in the same boat here, like I said,
[02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:19.600]  with two kids who, at this point, when we first had our kids, it felt like they were so far apart
[02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:24.160]  in age. Right? Oh, I know. I know. We were just playing with that. Last night, Ellie was pulling
[02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:28.640]  out some of her stuffies because she was feeling pretty ragged. And she found that little bird
[02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:36.080]  Jonas gave her in New Zealand. They were like babies. It was like a little baby and a big baby.
[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:45.920]  Yeah. But at this point, it feels like they are both, quote, unquote, about 10 years old.
[02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:56.640]  Yeah. And that's a loose approximation. I have to say, honest to God, and we haven't indoctrinated
[02:00:56.640 --> 02:01:04.800]  Jonas with politics. We don't make him talk about it. We don't make him think about it.
[02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:12.640]  He just absorbs what he picks up. I have to say, he is devastated. He's absolutely devastated. And
[02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:20.320]  the kids, again, maybe it's because we're in the city and it's an urban environment,
[02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:26.320]  but the kids today are so open-minded. Kids today, he's got like...
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:32.720]  Oh, it's unbelievably different. My daughter does not need to be schooled. It's okay for
[02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:41.040]  gay people to be together. It's everywhere. It's the teachers at her school. That's where we live.
[02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:47.120]  This is life. These are our friends. And it would be like saying to her, you shouldn't punch people
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:50.160]  in the face just because they're wearing a blue shirt. She'd be like, well, yeah, of course not.
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:53.200]  Why did you need to tell me that? Well, just so you know, it's okay if gay people are together.
[02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:58.960]  I've said this before, and I think you listen to my show, so maybe you've heard it, but I think
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:06.240]  it's the most amazing thing. Jonas' school has a club and it's called GLOW, G-L-O-W, and it stands
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:14.880]  for gay, lesbian, or whatever. And to me, it is the greatest. It's so much better than LGBT.
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:24.960]  And then, you know, they keep, you know, there's Q and... QIA. Yeah, QIA. Gay, lesbian, or whatever
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:30.320]  is to me... Oh, that's the actual name? No, it's literally the name. It's officially the name. I'm
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:36.240]  not making it up. It is so... It's actually weirdly efficient. But nobody, but like, he doesn't think
[02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:45.840]  it's funny or clever at all. That's literally, but it actually is what everybody of his generation
[02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:50.560]  seems to think is like, well, yeah, you know, whatever you're into, you're into. Well, cool.
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:55.840]  You know, it's all right. Why would that matter to me? It's like me worrying about you having a
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:03:02.640]  green car. But this election result is such a repudiation of that or whatever part, right?
[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:14.240]  And the kids get it. The kids do. There's no denying it. There's, I mean, and it's not just
[02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:21.120]  like the video of the Latino girl saying to Hillary Clinton, I'm worried that my parents
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:24.880]  are going to be deported. And, you know, Hillary says, come here, you know, I'm going to do
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:31.840]  whatever I can. It's not, it's all kids. It doesn't matter what their background is. All
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:38.000]  kids see it. And it really, I don't know what to do. I really don't. It's the most lost I've ever
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:47.200]  felt as a parent. Yeah, I agree with you. I mean, it's so early. I think it's at a time when you're
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:52.800]  not sure what's going on. You're feeling at sea. You know, I think the advice to not panic is a
[02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:58.880]  good one. I mean, it's hard not to, but I think on some level, you've kind of got to just, you've
[02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:02.960]  got to just feel your way through and know we've gotten through a lot of stuff. And we'll go
[02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:06.320]  through a lot of stuff in the future. I don't have anything inspirational to say here, except that,
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:11.200]  like, you just, you've got to keep your cool, keep doing the right thing and try not to be unkind.
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:15.520]  Like right now, there's a lot of people going after each other and there's a real vibe of
[02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:21.680]  telling, it feels like there's the beginnings of a vibe of finger pointing and there's a big vibe.
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:26.720]  And you know, if that's your thing, you know, Hakuna Matata. But like, I would feel like if
[02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:31.520]  I had one thing to ask, let's go easy on that for a while. And let's go easy on tearing each other
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:35.680]  apart or tearing other people apart. And let's maybe just have at least a couple, three days
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:40.080]  where we don't tell people that they're feeling wrong incorrectly or they're feeling bad wrongly.
[02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:45.360]  That's, let's let people have a time to grieve for whatever it is they're grieving for,
[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:52.720]  even if you don't think they deserve it. I, that's exactly how I feel. And I don't want,
[02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:56.080]  again, I don't want to point any fingers. I really don't. I mean,
[02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:06.400]  I just want to say, keep pushing in the right direction and, and forget about, it's so hard
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:15.920]  because we're as, as mechanical devices, human beings are meant to see everything day by day,
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:23.440]  hour by hour, moment by moment. But the truth is, you know, in the longterm, what matters is,
[02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:31.680]  you know, on the years, you know, years and decades perspective and just keep pushing
[02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:38.320]  in the right direction and it'll work out even though this is clearly a setback.
[02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:47.280]  But I really do think that it's, it's not right, counterproductive to start pointing fingers.
[02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:53.200]  Well, let's check back in after a while. I gotta, I gotta go pick up my kid and start
[02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:57.360]  my holiday party. I have a holiday party. Did you get the invitation?
[02:05:57.360 --> 02:06:06.800]  I'm going to be joining you. Merlin man, where else can people listen to you? You are the,
[02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:11.280]  in my opinion, probably the single greatest podcaster on the internet.
[02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:16.640]  You're always saying that. No, but I actually mean that. You're actually,
[02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:23.120]  you have like a bizarre gift for being really good on a podcast. Bizarre gift, declares John Gruber.
[02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:25.760]  I don't know. I just, I don't fucking know at this point.
[02:06:25.760 --> 02:06:30.320]  Tell me a very good branding. Just go to hot dogs. Ladies, if you want to see me on Twitter,
[02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:34.080]  I'm feeling kind of quiet right now. Go to hot dogs, ladies on Twitter.
[02:06:34.080 --> 02:06:38.640]  You know what they should do? They should listen to the show I do with John Siracusa.
[02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:43.520]  I do show John Siracusa called Reconcilable Differences. Never heard of it. It's at
[02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:51.200]  relay.fm slash RD. Who is this guy, John Siracusa? I don't know. I think he might be an Italian.
[02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:57.280]  I don't know if he's here illegally. We're going to build a big, beautiful wall with Napoli and
[02:06:57.280 --> 02:07:22.240]  we're going to make the Italians pay for it. Eh, it's a spicy meatball.
