[00:00.000 --> 00:04.400]  Hey, john mg sealer. How you doing?
[00:05.040 --> 00:09.840]  Good. It's been a long time. I know months. I feel like I
[00:09.860 --> 00:14.720]  strongly suspect, but I would never be as industrious as to
[00:14.720 --> 00:17.340]  actually check. But I bet this is the longest stretch you've
[00:17.340 --> 00:20.560]  been without being on on the show. I think so. I think that's
[00:20.560 --> 00:23.280]  right. But you know, I live in London now. So that's part of
[00:23.280 --> 00:26.280]  the reason. So yeah, that is it makes it a little bit harder to
[00:26.280 --> 00:29.280]  communicate. Yeah. It's funny because it's going back to
[00:29.280 --> 00:34.880]  back. It's last episode was Ben Thompson, who's in Taipei. And
[00:34.900 --> 00:38.400]  now it's you in London. So I feel like I've gone around the
[00:38.400 --> 00:38.720]  world.
[00:39.880 --> 00:43.440]  You have a very international audience, hopefully. Yeah, I
[00:43.440 --> 00:49.080]  don't know that it could I, I honestly think I maybe somebody
[00:49.080 --> 00:51.200]  in New Zealand or something could be further away. But
[00:51.200 --> 00:55.560]  that's, it's about as far away as as people can get. Well, this
[00:55.560 --> 00:57.600]  is much better. You know, normally, I have to talk to the
[00:57.600 --> 01:00.360]  West Coast, and that's eight hours. And so that keeps me up,
[01:00.360 --> 01:03.080]  you know, one 1am 2am for those types of calls.
[01:03.520 --> 01:05.880]  Yeah, I'll bet that that's actually pretty weird. Because
[01:05.880 --> 01:12.400]  I do feel like being lifelong East Coast US person. I feel
[01:12.400 --> 01:16.720]  like, you know, like Greenwich Mean Time isn't that far away.
[01:16.880 --> 01:20.720]  But but for someone from the West Coast, it truly is. It's a
[01:20.720 --> 01:22.040]  it's an entire eight hours.
[01:22.280 --> 01:26.640]  Yeah, we'll see how how I'm going to watch the Super Bowl. I
[01:26.640 --> 01:31.640]  think it starts at like 1230 or so, maybe 1130pm. And then it's
[01:31.640 --> 01:35.360]  going to go obviously to like 2.30am. Obviously, they have a
[01:35.360 --> 01:39.040]  lot of different bars and stuff set up over here to show it, but
[01:39.240 --> 01:42.520]  it will be weird because it's in it's in Arizona. Right. So is
[01:42.520 --> 01:44.800]  that West Coast or is that it's either Western Mountain Time,
[01:44.800 --> 01:45.280]  but yeah,
[01:45.600 --> 01:48.440]  Arizona is definitely West Coast time. Okay, I think.
[01:49.640 --> 01:50.280]  Definitely.
[01:50.960 --> 01:54.280]  But isn't Arizona one of the No, or is it New Mexico? That's
[01:54.280 --> 01:58.400]  like one of the like a holdout on? Yeah, one of those does not
[01:58.400 --> 02:01.400]  do it. And then Vegas does it weirdly. Like they sometimes are
[02:01.400 --> 02:04.400]  on one time zone, sometimes on another or something like that.
[02:04.760 --> 02:07.520]  Yeah, well, they they legislate it in Vegas that there's no
[02:07.520 --> 02:10.640]  clocks anywhere. Right? Like a lot of you have to like hide
[02:10.640 --> 02:12.560]  your watch when you get to the airport there. They'll
[02:12.680 --> 02:14.720]  confiscate it. That's right.
[02:17.560 --> 02:20.840]  So the big news this week, I feel like we have to talk about
[02:20.840 --> 02:25.600]  it. Can't can't skip it is is the quarterly results from
[02:25.600 --> 02:30.120]  Apple. Yes. How do you which how do you miss that? And it's
[02:30.120 --> 02:34.440]  like, I know I'm not a finance blogger. I try not to
[02:34.480 --> 02:38.040]  overemphasize it. But I feel like in this case, it's so
[02:38.080 --> 02:43.280]  outlandishly exceptional that you can't help but talk about
[02:43.280 --> 02:46.520]  it and write about it and make links to it and stuff like that.
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.600]  Yeah, it's insane. I remember, I guess it was a couple years
[02:50.600 --> 02:53.720]  ago, probably when I was obviously still with maybe it
[02:53.720 --> 02:56.520]  was three years ago, then when I was still with TechCrunch and I
[02:56.520 --> 03:00.280]  was obviously doing a lot of the coverage of the Apple
[03:00.280 --> 03:03.520]  earnings and each subsequent subsequent year they would go
[03:03.520 --> 03:07.240]  up and up and up and one of the years it was like insane. It
[03:07.240 --> 03:09.520]  was like they made thirteen billion dollars in profit in
[03:09.520 --> 03:12.480]  the holiday quarter. So it was either two or three years ago
[03:12.680 --> 03:16.720]  and it seemed like a time like wow that I mean that's amazing.
[03:16.720 --> 03:20.400]  It's sort of in that time when, you know, the margins were
[03:20.400 --> 03:24.040]  still very, very high and then they were everyone was thinking
[03:24.040 --> 03:25.840]  that they were going to start coming down because of
[03:26.040 --> 03:28.360]  different products that were coming out in the future iPad
[03:28.360 --> 03:32.160]  and whatnot. And so it seemed like the 13 billion might be a
[03:32.160 --> 03:35.200]  high watermark. And now, you know, that's just been totally
[03:35.200 --> 03:38.920]  obliterated by this quarter. The thing that comes to mind for
[03:38.920 --> 03:43.000]  me, I keep thinking about it. I don't know why, because it's
[03:43.000 --> 03:46.240]  not like it's a particularly even number of years, but four
[03:46.240 --> 03:51.120]  years ago was the debut or no, I guess it was five years ago.
[03:51.120 --> 03:53.320]  No, I guess so. It is kind of it's a half decade to five
[03:53.320 --> 03:56.680]  years ago. 2010 was when the original iPad came out, right?
[03:56.920 --> 04:01.160]  And I remember there were two things about that keynote that
[04:01.160 --> 04:04.320]  I that stand out to me and it's not the iPad in particular, but
[04:04.320 --> 04:09.960]  it was that was when they introduced the A4 system chip
[04:09.960 --> 04:13.680]  and I remember Steve Jobs being very, very proud of it with and
[04:13.680 --> 04:16.800]  in hindsight, it wasn't that great of a chip, but I feel like
[04:16.800 --> 04:19.920]  the reason that he was bragging about it in hindsight was that
[04:19.920 --> 04:24.200]  he knew the pipeline of the A5, the A6, like what they were
[04:24.200 --> 04:26.880]  planning to do year after year and how they were going to take
[04:26.880 --> 04:30.880]  control of their own silicon in the years to come. And the other
[04:30.880 --> 04:32.960]  thing I remember, do you remember this? I think that was
[04:32.960 --> 04:37.120]  the event. I'm like 98% sure that it was the event where he
[04:37.120 --> 04:40.320]  mentioned that Apple was now a $50 billion a year company.
[04:40.320 --> 04:43.760]  Yeah, I think you're right. I do remember. I remember being at
[04:43.760 --> 04:46.960]  whatever event that was when he sort of highlighted that for the
[04:46.960 --> 04:48.240]  first time. I do remember that.
[04:48.400 --> 04:50.800]  Right. And you know, he said almost the same thing that like
[04:50.800 --> 04:53.280]  I said here is like, you know, we don't want to talk. You know,
[04:53.280 --> 04:55.920]  we have all sorts of products to talk about. But I just want to
[04:55.920 --> 04:59.280]  take a moment and and just mark this that we're now Apple is now
[04:59.280 --> 05:04.160]  a $50 billion a year company. And sort of saying like, you
[05:04.160 --> 05:07.840]  know, that's the big boys club in Silicon Valley, right? 50
[05:07.840 --> 05:13.200]  50 billion a year in revenue. And they did 74 billion in
[05:13.200 --> 05:19.360]  revenue in a quarter. It's five five years later, right? Like,
[05:19.360 --> 05:21.600]  and it really was worth marketing. It was really was
[05:21.600 --> 05:25.120]  remarkable, like five years ago that Apple was doing 50 billion
[05:25.120 --> 05:28.400]  a year in revenue. Like that's a huge number. It's a ton of
[05:28.400 --> 05:32.880]  money. It's way more than Apple did it, you know, for decades,
[05:32.880 --> 05:37.840]  or ever really until then ever. And all of a sudden, that's, you
[05:37.840 --> 05:40.720]  know, two thirds of one quarter. I mean, what are they
[05:40.720 --> 05:43.200]  going to hit this year? So everyone's obviously talking
[05:43.200 --> 05:46.080]  about in terms of earnings in terms of profit, they're
[05:46.080 --> 05:48.400]  actually, you know, they set the record, they eclipsed all
[05:48.400 --> 05:51.200]  those oil companies, including the Russian state oil company,
[05:51.200 --> 05:53.600]  you know, in terms of the amount of profit they're making,
[05:53.600 --> 05:56.880]  but they're also very much on track. This being, you know,
[05:56.880 --> 06:00.720]  technically the fiscal quarter one, they're very much on track
[06:00.720 --> 06:03.840]  to break the all-time yearly record for that, which is also
[06:03.840 --> 06:06.800]  held by all the oil companies. There's an outlier, the
[06:06.800 --> 06:09.600]  Fannie Mae outlier thing, which is on the Wikipedia page,
[06:09.600 --> 06:12.240]  but that's with the government bailout and everything. It's
[06:12.240 --> 06:16.400]  sort of, you know, not a fair comparison. So they're probably
[06:16.400 --> 06:18.640]  going to set that record. And in terms of, you know, revenue,
[06:18.640 --> 06:20.720]  yearly revenues, what's it going to be this year? 200
[06:20.720 --> 06:23.600]  billion, something like that? You know, obviously this is the
[06:23.600 --> 06:25.760]  big quarter, but then, you know, next quarter should be
[06:25.760 --> 06:27.920]  pretty big, then it goes down a little bit, and then it will
[06:27.920 --> 06:31.120]  spike up again, sort of with back-to-school sales and
[06:31.120 --> 06:33.520]  everything like that. I assume 200 billion, something like
[06:33.520 --> 06:38.160]  that? It seems within reach, definitely, you know, because
[06:38.160 --> 06:43.440]  what? 40-40-40, you know, gets you pretty close. Yeah, that's
[06:43.440 --> 06:48.320]  so crazy. And, you know, remember, I guess it was a
[06:48.320 --> 06:51.200]  couple years ago, I was also covering this, you know,
[06:51.200 --> 06:54.480]  talking about Apple's market cap, which you can also make an
[06:54.480 --> 06:58.080]  argument, you know, isn't really, it's sort of symbolic
[06:58.080 --> 07:00.400]  more than it's really meaningful what market cap
[07:00.400 --> 07:02.960]  actually means, and, you know, people always argue about that.
[07:02.960 --> 07:05.280]  It was a big deal when Apple, of course, passed Microsoft,
[07:05.280 --> 07:08.880]  which was, I don't even know now, four years ago, or maybe
[07:08.880 --> 07:11.680]  longer than that. And then Apple was chasing Exxon for a
[07:11.680 --> 07:14.000]  long time, and at one point I remember they were something
[07:14.000 --> 07:16.480]  like 200 billion behind in market cap, and it just seemed
[07:16.480 --> 07:18.720]  like impossible that they would ever get there. And now
[07:18.720 --> 07:22.000]  there's something, they're over 200 billion ahead of Exxon
[07:22.000 --> 07:26.000]  now. They might be 300 billion ahead, and obviously Exxon's
[07:26.000 --> 07:29.760]  depressed because of the oil situation going on, their stock
[07:29.760 --> 07:35.200]  is, but it's incredible. I think someone has been tweeting
[07:35.200 --> 07:39.840]  today and showcasing this, that I think Apple's market cap is
[07:39.840 --> 07:43.520]  now just about the exact same as Google and Microsoft's
[07:43.520 --> 07:47.680]  combined. That's insane. Somebody tweeted, I saw
[07:47.680 --> 07:50.240]  yesterday, this, we're recording on Friday, January
[07:50.240 --> 07:55.920]  30. So yesterday, I think at the close of market, that Apple
[07:55.920 --> 08:00.800]  closed with, when the markets closed at exactly double the
[08:00.800 --> 08:03.840]  market cap of Google. Yeah, I guess that would make sense
[08:03.840 --> 08:06.080]  because Google's ahead of Microsoft now. And they're
[08:06.080 --> 08:08.160]  almost neck and neck. They're like very close to one another.
[08:08.160 --> 08:12.640]  So yeah, that's right. I mean, it's almost uncanny how close
[08:12.640 --> 08:16.640]  to exactly double it was, which is, yeah, I mean, again, it's
[08:16.640 --> 08:24.320]  it's, you know, in years past, and probably years future, you
[08:24.320 --> 08:29.920]  know, when Apple's stock is down, you know, for reasons good
[08:29.920 --> 08:33.440]  or reasons nonsensical, it's, you know, like you said, it's
[08:33.440 --> 08:36.880]  not proof of anything. It's not like market cap is an
[08:36.880 --> 08:41.840]  infallible measure, but it's at least a measure of what people
[08:41.840 --> 08:44.800]  think of the company. Yeah. And I mean, right now, the
[08:44.800 --> 08:47.600]  craziest thing of all this is you can make a very good
[08:47.600 --> 08:50.640]  argument that Apple is undervalued on the stock market.
[08:50.640 --> 08:53.520]  They're trading at multiples that are way below what some of
[08:53.520 --> 08:56.160]  their peers are trading at and given the numbers they just
[08:56.160 --> 09:01.280]  released, I mean, it's not so insane anymore to think that
[09:01.280 --> 09:04.400]  they could be the first trillion dollar company if
[09:04.400 --> 09:07.920]  they're able to sort of, I mean, we could talk about what
[09:07.920 --> 09:12.720]  it would take. It would take continuing to grow iPhone and I
[09:12.720 --> 09:16.000]  think we all agree now, you know, you they can continue to
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.600]  do that. They don't have a massive market share still so
[09:19.600 --> 09:22.880]  there's there's room for growth and then China, I think is the
[09:22.880 --> 09:28.000]  big sort of factor in that and if they can keep doing that and
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.040]  if the stock market overall keeps sort of going up and
[09:31.040 --> 09:34.320]  there's no, you know, assurances of that, of course,
[09:34.320 --> 09:42.000]  it's it's possible. It's crazy. Yeah, but it's possible. So the
[09:42.000 --> 09:45.520]  the I don't know if elephant in the room is the right analogy,
[09:45.520 --> 09:51.360]  but it's it's clearly largely almost two thirds three course
[09:51.360 --> 09:54.800]  three quarters driven by iPhone. Like iPhone has become
[09:54.800 --> 09:59.760]  an enormous chunk of Apple's business. The Mac is
[09:59.760 --> 10:03.280]  historically at an all-time high, but still that's you
[10:03.280 --> 10:06.480]  know, that's an established market and it's you know 4
[10:06.480 --> 10:10.400]  million 5 million units a quarter. iPad is down, which is
[10:10.400 --> 10:14.160]  weird. It's not collapsing. You know, I saw somebody call it
[10:14.160 --> 10:17.920]  gloomy. It's not gloomy. I mean they sold 21 million iPads
[10:17.920 --> 10:21.040]  last quarter. It's just weird though compared to iPhone
[10:21.040 --> 10:26.880]  because it's down 20% year over year. But iPhone is up
[10:26.880 --> 10:31.520]  enormously. It's it's almost unbelievable how much it's up
[10:31.520 --> 10:34.240]  cuz I think that it was 51 million iPhones. They sold a
[10:34.240 --> 10:39.200]  year ago in the holiday quarter and 74 million iPhones this
[10:39.200 --> 10:43.280]  year. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's if I read the numbers right
[10:43.280 --> 10:46.400]  someone broke it down. Maybe it's from or I think they're at
[10:46.400 --> 10:51.280]  69%. The iPhone is 69% of Apple's business now. I'm not
[10:51.280 --> 10:54.000]  sure if that's revenue or profit, but you know it's about
[10:54.000 --> 10:58.080]  it's it's roughly probably both and I mean it's probably
[10:58.080 --> 11:02.560]  higher actually for profit, but that's crazy. But you're right.
[11:02.560 --> 11:05.440]  If you were just if you were to take of course the iPhone
[11:05.440 --> 11:09.840]  business away from Apple, they would still be near the top. If
[11:09.840 --> 11:14.640]  not at the top of the biggest sort of business in terms of
[11:14.640 --> 11:18.000]  revenue and then all of those other businesses, both the
[11:18.000 --> 11:22.560]  Mac, the iPad, and even in you know increasingly iTunes and
[11:22.560 --> 11:26.160]  the app store now are becoming the if you broke those out,
[11:26.160 --> 11:28.480]  they would each like probably be Fortune 500 companies in
[11:28.480 --> 11:32.560]  their own right when you think about it, which is crazy. Right
[11:32.560 --> 11:35.520]  because the store you know the iTunes store whatever you want
[11:35.520 --> 11:40.480]  to call it iTunes plus app store is some some number of
[11:40.480 --> 11:44.160]  billion a quarter now right. Yeah. It's it just keeps going
[11:44.160 --> 11:48.080]  up and remember they used to say specifically about the app
[11:48.080 --> 11:51.760]  store that you know it's it's basically they didn't use the
[11:51.760 --> 11:54.240]  word sort of loss leader, but they just said they run it sort
[11:54.240 --> 11:58.320]  of break even right and then they you know it's the whole
[11:58.320 --> 12:00.480]  thought was that it was just out there to sell cell devices,
[12:00.480 --> 12:02.640]  which of course you could still make the argument. That's
[12:02.640 --> 12:04.560]  probably the biggest part of it, but they're starting to
[12:04.560 --> 12:09.520]  make a lot of real meaningful money from that store. Yeah and
[12:09.520 --> 12:12.240]  I think it's always been the case and this is from years ago
[12:12.240 --> 12:15.520]  when it was the numbers were much smaller where a lot of
[12:15.520 --> 12:19.360]  what they made was from the float where they collect the
[12:19.360 --> 12:22.240]  money and it doesn't you know they can do stuff with the
[12:22.240 --> 12:26.560]  money. You know just you know they hold it for a little bit
[12:26.560 --> 12:30.480]  and while they're holding it, they can you know do a
[12:30.480 --> 12:34.880]  financial guy thing. Yeah, that's right and make a little
[12:34.880 --> 12:37.600]  bit of money while you hold it like as that money passes
[12:37.600 --> 12:41.360]  through their fingers. It you know it's good for them because
[12:41.360 --> 12:44.000]  they don't you know they don't immediately pass it on to who
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.800]  they're paying out right. They they get a little bit of what
[12:46.800 --> 12:49.760]  makes Amazon Amazon sort of that that aspect of the
[12:49.760 --> 12:52.240]  business right and anybody who's a developer knows you
[12:52.240 --> 12:55.120]  don't get paid by Apple until the end of the quarter or the
[12:55.120 --> 12:57.120]  end of the month. You know it's you know they hold the money.
[12:57.120 --> 12:59.360]  It's not like you get paid every day as people buy your
[12:59.360 --> 13:02.800]  app right. You wait and then you know 2 weeks after the
[13:02.800 --> 13:06.000]  month is over you get you get your check from them. In the
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.880]  meantime, they're holding that money and and making money on
[13:08.880 --> 13:12.400]  it and now that it's an enormous sums of money. It's
[13:12.400 --> 13:18.560]  it's even more so yeah. What do you think about the notion of
[13:18.560 --> 13:22.560]  the correct me if I'm wrong, but they win the Apple Watch is
[13:22.560 --> 13:24.640]  released so they announced of course it's going to be
[13:24.640 --> 13:28.400]  shipping in April when it's released. They're not breaking
[13:28.400 --> 13:31.200]  that out as a separate entity right. That's going to be roped
[13:31.200 --> 13:35.600]  in under something else. I'm not sure what other services or
[13:35.600 --> 13:37.440]  something, but they're not going to break that out in
[13:37.440 --> 13:39.920]  terms of sales at least to begin with correct. Is that what
[13:39.920 --> 13:43.040]  they said? That's what they've said. Yeah and everybody's
[13:43.040 --> 13:46.640]  going to try to backwards engineer it clearly from the
[13:46.640 --> 13:49.680]  you know whatever wherever it is that they reported under
[13:49.680 --> 13:52.240]  right. I think that's that's it's sort of interesting to
[13:52.240 --> 13:57.040]  think about it because so I know I know you and I know I
[13:57.040 --> 14:00.160]  and many others have long railed against Amazon for sort
[14:00.160 --> 14:03.680]  of not being transparent with their numbers. Whereas Apple is
[14:03.680 --> 14:06.320]  we still have no idea how many Kindles have ever been sold. I
[14:06.320 --> 14:08.480]  think with this this most recent quarter, which Amazon
[14:08.480 --> 14:12.560]  had there is some hints that you could finally back into it
[14:12.560 --> 14:15.920]  in a way, but they still have never come out and directly
[14:15.920 --> 14:20.400]  said you know what the number is and with they also announced
[14:20.400 --> 14:23.120]  that this quarter that the coming quarter that they will
[14:23.120 --> 14:26.960]  finally be breaking out AWS, you know their cloud services
[14:26.960 --> 14:30.560]  infrastructure. They'll be breaking out that revenue as a
[14:30.560 --> 14:33.200]  separate business and so they'll be reporting on that
[14:33.200 --> 14:36.160]  and I think that that's smart the way that they've done it
[14:36.160 --> 14:39.520]  while it has been you know annoying for anyone who's trying
[14:39.520 --> 14:42.880]  to get some idea of what Amazon is actually selling. If
[14:42.880 --> 14:45.840]  anything, obviously they're selling candles but fire phones
[14:45.840 --> 14:49.120]  you know and those types of things, but I would imagine
[14:49.120 --> 14:53.600]  that Apple is first putting the Apple Watch under sort of this
[14:53.600 --> 14:56.560]  same type of thing that that Apple TV is under though they
[14:56.560 --> 14:58.720]  do announce the Apple TV numbers. They just announced
[14:58.720 --> 15:03.120]  you know whatever it was 5 million sold recently and I
[15:03.120 --> 15:07.840]  think it's 25 million total or something like that, but I
[15:07.840 --> 15:10.000]  would imagine that they'll they'll keep sort of Apple
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.200]  Watch under wraps until there's something more substantial to
[15:13.200 --> 15:15.760]  talk about if there ever is sort of like what Amazon has
[15:15.760 --> 15:18.400]  done with AWS where they wrote that into something else and
[15:18.400 --> 15:20.400]  now that it's substantial. They're gonna break it out and
[15:20.400 --> 15:25.120]  actually talk about it. Yeah. I don't know you know for for the
[15:25.120 --> 15:28.560]  reputation that Apple has you know well deserved. I guess as
[15:28.560 --> 15:32.880]  being secretive and relatively they don't like to explain
[15:32.880 --> 15:35.440]  themselves. You know they they here's our products and that's
[15:35.440 --> 15:38.160]  it and they don't like to talk about what they do. They're
[15:38.160 --> 15:42.960]  they're very forthcoming and have been in the whole you know
[15:42.960 --> 15:46.880]  modern era of Apple very forthcoming in their financial
[15:46.880 --> 15:51.040]  reporting. Yeah and and so you know now that I think about it,
[15:51.040 --> 15:55.040]  I I can't imagine that we're going to get a an Apple Watch
[15:55.040 --> 15:59.360]  launch without a weekend end of weekend sort of report as to
[15:59.360 --> 16:04.720]  how many units were shipped or sorry were actually sold.
[16:04.720 --> 16:08.320]  Unless it's I don't know II can't imagine that they they
[16:08.320 --> 16:12.160]  don't do that right. I guess it's it's it just seems weird.
[16:12.160 --> 16:15.200]  You know I understand it's almost not surprising because
[16:15.200 --> 16:20.400]  they're secretive and I feel especially the mix of you know
[16:20.400 --> 16:22.960]  for you know they don't and they don't one thing they don't
[16:22.960 --> 16:26.720]  reveal and I've never revealed is the mix of iPhones. So they
[16:26.720 --> 16:30.240]  don't say how many iPhone sixes were sold. How many six plus
[16:30.240 --> 16:34.560]  how many five C's how many five S's they've never revealed
[16:34.560 --> 16:39.760]  that you can kind of get it a little bit cuz they do reveal
[16:39.760 --> 16:43.200]  their average selling price and so you can kind of create a
[16:43.200 --> 16:47.280]  formula that estimates it based on the prices that they have.
[16:47.280 --> 16:50.240]  But the watch everybody expects that the watch is going to have
[16:50.240 --> 16:55.120]  an incredibly wide variance in price going from the sport
[16:55.120 --> 16:59.440]  model at 350 to however much the gold one's going to cost,
[16:59.440 --> 17:01.520]  but most people, including me think it's going to cost at
[17:01.520 --> 17:06.240]  least a couple $1000. Yeah. So you know the mix on that is
[17:06.240 --> 17:10.640]  going to be way more a way bigger divide than any other
[17:10.640 --> 17:15.680]  product in Apple's business. Yeah and I wonder if that sort
[17:15.680 --> 17:18.320]  of plays into the notion of why they wouldn't break out the
[17:18.320 --> 17:22.880]  Apple Watch too because it will be because of the the wide
[17:22.880 --> 17:26.880]  spread of prices. It would be sort of maybe easier. Maybe not
[17:26.880 --> 17:30.000]  but you know to know boy they must be selling a lot of the
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.720]  gold version cuz look at these numbers or boy they must be
[17:32.720 --> 17:35.680]  selling basically no gold versions because you're sort of
[17:35.680 --> 17:38.480]  right because the average if the average selling price is
[17:38.480 --> 17:42.000]  you know $450 or something like that. That's right. Yeah. Yeah.
[17:42.000 --> 17:45.120]  I don't know. I'm not quite sure and who knows maybe once
[17:45.120 --> 17:47.680]  the business settles down, they will report it and it's just
[17:47.680 --> 17:51.680]  that they don't know what to expect. I you know, it's like
[17:51.680 --> 17:55.120]  you know new territory so I don't know. So one one one
[17:55.120 --> 17:59.280]  other notion about the the watch that sort of has been
[17:59.280 --> 18:02.320]  interesting to think about in recent weeks sort of leading
[18:02.320 --> 18:06.320]  up. So well two things first do you think are they going to do
[18:06.320 --> 18:12.800]  some sort of other event before April to more sort of put it
[18:12.800 --> 18:16.560]  out there in front of the world one more time with a with a
[18:16.560 --> 18:19.920]  proper unveiling with all functionality that it's going
[18:19.920 --> 18:24.960]  to ship with you know working my assumption all along has
[18:24.960 --> 18:29.920]  been yes, but now that it's like getting close and I'm
[18:29.920 --> 18:34.240]  starting to like you know make plans for the next couple of
[18:34.240 --> 18:38.080]  months and you know there's a couple of conferences that I
[18:38.080 --> 18:40.560]  might go to and I'm thinking like hey, which are these
[18:40.560 --> 18:43.440]  things should I maybe not do because I should keep my
[18:43.440 --> 18:49.520]  schedule open. I'm starting to wonder II. I've always thought
[18:49.520 --> 18:52.560]  that yes, they are going to cuz I think that they have to show
[18:52.560 --> 18:56.240]  more of the functionality. I think they have to reveal more
[18:56.240 --> 19:00.000]  of what the watch does with the first party software. In other
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.800]  words right out of the box, the stuff that's in there and how
[19:02.800 --> 19:07.760]  better to do it than at an event. But I kind of also feel
[19:07.760 --> 19:10.320]  like they can't do it if they don't have anything else to
[19:10.320 --> 19:16.320]  show. I I think you're right and I think I can so I know now
[19:16.320 --> 19:20.400]  that they are definitely working with some other people
[19:20.400 --> 19:22.320]  some third parties who you would imagine that they would
[19:22.320 --> 19:25.520]  be working with already to sort of get things ready to go for
[19:25.520 --> 19:30.800]  launch and so that definitely points to you know a potential
[19:30.800 --> 19:35.040]  other events and unveiling where they have a few of the
[19:35.040 --> 19:38.720]  the major players up on stage sort of showing off what the
[19:38.720 --> 19:42.240]  third party can do with this thing right and I feel like
[19:42.240 --> 19:45.040]  there's like three levels. There's there's a the first
[19:45.040 --> 19:47.680]  party software. What what the watch does right out of the
[19:47.680 --> 19:51.440]  box. There's the SDK that they've already revealed, which
[19:51.440 --> 19:55.040]  is somewhat limited. It's the whole thing where you know you
[19:55.040 --> 19:58.240]  have to have an iPhone app and it's iPhone apps more or less
[19:58.240 --> 20:04.560]  projecting notifications to the watch and they even say I mean
[20:04.560 --> 20:10.400]  this and this is totally like new open Apple. You know Tim
[20:10.400 --> 20:14.640]  Cook, you know era where they even said when they revealed
[20:14.640 --> 20:18.560]  this initial third party SDK that a full SDK with native
[20:18.560 --> 20:22.160]  apps will be coming later in 2015 right. So it's not native
[20:22.160 --> 20:25.360]  apps that the software doesn't run on the watch the software
[20:25.360 --> 20:28.960]  with the current SDK runs on the phone and just sort of
[20:28.960 --> 20:32.960]  projects a UI on the watch right. It's a notification.
[20:32.960 --> 20:36.400]  They're almost like widgets. I guess in a way, it's like a
[20:36.400 --> 20:38.880]  small. It's going to be packed into the iPhone app. So yeah,
[20:38.880 --> 20:42.960]  I you know it's II feel like it's almost new territory. The
[20:42.960 --> 20:45.600]  closest thing that would be something like you know to call
[20:45.600 --> 20:48.560]  it something like a widget like a widget that you project, but
[20:48.560 --> 20:52.160]  then I feel like there's got to be a little not got to be, but
[20:52.160 --> 20:57.520]  almost certainly going to be a little bit more sort of blessed
[20:57.520 --> 21:02.080]  partner third parties who are working with Apple and will
[21:02.080 --> 21:07.760]  have things that aren't in that public SDK, but are a little
[21:07.760 --> 21:10.960]  bit more like if you you know are inside if if you've been
[21:10.960 --> 21:14.400]  embraced by Apple. If if they've asked you to send a guy
[21:14.400 --> 21:17.680]  or a team to spend 3 weeks in Cupertino that you're going to
[21:17.680 --> 21:20.800]  have a little bit more tighter integration with the watch
[21:20.800 --> 21:23.920]  right to demonstrate it. And I haven't looked at the SDK nor
[21:23.920 --> 21:26.960]  if I did what I really have a great understanding of it, but
[21:26.960 --> 21:29.840]  like something like having access to the music that you
[21:29.840 --> 21:32.800]  can store on the watch like is that available to third parties
[21:32.800 --> 21:35.680]  or is it's not available to Apple. Okay it right now. It's
[21:35.680 --> 21:38.720]  only available to Apple. The audio playback and Marco
[21:38.720 --> 21:41.520]  Arment has been looking into that for the obvious reason
[21:41.520 --> 21:45.120]  that he has a podcast app that would be perfectly suited to
[21:45.120 --> 21:48.560]  actually storing some audio on the watch itself. So it's not
[21:48.560 --> 21:51.040]  there yet. So you could see though that would be an obvious
[21:51.040 --> 21:54.160]  one for like Apple to work with a trusted third party to sort
[21:54.160 --> 21:57.040]  of get you know give them access to it. Maybe it's Spotify
[21:57.040 --> 22:00.320]  or or well Spotify is sort of a weird one. I don't know how
[22:00.320 --> 22:02.800]  that would work, but something like that you know or running
[22:02.800 --> 22:04.960]  app if it's some sort of fitness app that can access
[22:04.960 --> 22:10.880]  those. Yeah and and you know there were like clearly before
[22:10.880 --> 22:14.800]  the initial event, they had already been talking to some
[22:14.800 --> 22:19.120]  people like Starwood's hotels. Oh, that's right. Yeah. They
[22:19.120 --> 22:21.680]  said like, hey, you're going to be able to check into any
[22:21.680 --> 22:27.200]  Starwood's hotel and use your watch as your key and then you
[22:27.200 --> 22:29.600]  get into your room just by putting your wrist up to the
[22:29.600 --> 22:33.280]  door, which is awesome. In my opinion, as somebody who very
[22:33.280 --> 22:37.520]  frequently loses his hotel keys. Yeah, I always demagnetize
[22:37.520 --> 22:40.000]  mine like when I put it, I always keep them in my pocket
[22:40.000 --> 22:45.520]  and I have either like a or I give them to my girlfriend and
[22:45.520 --> 22:47.680]  she puts it in her purse and she has an iPad in there and
[22:47.680 --> 22:50.880]  the iPad has the magnetic clasp and it always demagnetizes the
[22:50.880 --> 22:54.640]  stupid key. So yes, and they they give me a hard time. I've
[22:54.640 --> 22:56.880]  done that too, but I've done it and I don't keep it in the
[22:56.880 --> 23:00.000]  same pocket as my phone. I keep it in a different pocket and it
[23:00.000 --> 23:02.720]  still doesn't work. I don't know. I think the technology in
[23:02.720 --> 23:06.160]  those things is is pretty bad, but I don't know and when I
[23:06.160 --> 23:09.600]  check into like hotels where I've you know been a frequent
[23:09.600 --> 23:12.080]  customer. They're like how many keys do you want three keys?
[23:12.080 --> 23:15.520]  Should we give you? That's right. They've got they've got
[23:15.520 --> 23:19.120]  me in the file that I I need extra keys. So the watch you
[23:19.120 --> 23:20.640]  know the idea that you'll be able to do it, but that's
[23:20.640 --> 23:22.720]  clearly something that if they're going to announce it at
[23:22.720 --> 23:25.680]  the event, they would have partners lined up in advance.
[23:25.680 --> 23:29.760]  And do you think that also it gives them a sort of a natural
[23:29.760 --> 23:33.520]  way to to do a little bit deeper dive into Apple Pay
[23:33.520 --> 23:36.640]  where it's at right now, you know sort of the six month
[23:36.640 --> 23:39.040]  check in or something and then also to show it on the Apple
[23:39.040 --> 23:42.240]  Watch actually working. Obviously that that seems like
[23:42.240 --> 23:45.280]  it's already been a pretty big success for them and and will
[23:45.280 --> 23:47.840]  continue to be so and so that's that's another obvious thing
[23:47.840 --> 23:50.640]  that they would do at such an event. I would imagine. Yeah, I
[23:50.640 --> 23:55.840]  think and it's Apple Pay is sort of an interesting thing
[23:55.840 --> 23:58.400]  for Apple and to me and in terms of how much emphasis
[23:58.400 --> 24:01.280]  they're putting on it and it's sort of like to me, it's sort
[24:01.280 --> 24:03.200]  of like what we were talking about just a couple minutes ago
[24:03.200 --> 24:06.960]  with the the app store and iTunes store where they're not
[24:06.960 --> 24:10.000]  making a ton of money on it. They're only making you know
[24:10.000 --> 24:14.240]  fraction of very fraction of a 1% on each transaction. It's
[24:14.240 --> 24:17.920]  it's small amount per transaction right, but it's
[24:17.920 --> 24:21.200]  just about getting entrenched and having you know if once you
[24:21.200 --> 24:24.560]  get used to it, you don't want to not have an iPhone anymore
[24:24.560 --> 24:27.680]  because you know then you don't have Apple Pay and it just it
[24:27.680 --> 24:31.440]  it just is another way to sort of sink their teeth into
[24:31.440 --> 24:34.960]  people's daily lives. Yeah. You know the money isn't anything
[24:34.960 --> 24:38.880]  to sneeze at you know it's not bad. No it's a great moat is
[24:38.880 --> 24:42.640]  what you know what it starts out as and then over time much
[24:42.640 --> 24:45.600]  like you said like with the app store if they can get to
[24:45.600 --> 24:48.560]  interesting sort of transaction volume, which they're already
[24:48.560 --> 24:50.720]  well on their way to doing they're going to be making a
[24:50.720 --> 24:53.280]  lot of money off of that and they can also of course
[24:53.280 --> 24:57.440]  renegotiate the fees with the with the banking partners to
[24:57.440 --> 25:00.000]  get a little bit more money off of it. I think they have a lot
[25:00.000 --> 25:03.440]  of sort of wiggle room there to be able to to do to make that
[25:03.440 --> 25:06.480]  into a really really interesting business if they can
[25:06.480 --> 25:12.800]  get it to a scale. Yeah and I just first hand I've you know a
[25:12.800 --> 25:17.840]  month ago I got a moto the the latest model moto X just to
[25:17.840 --> 25:22.160]  sort of you know do the every year or two. You know what's it
[25:22.160 --> 25:26.560]  like to live with the latest and greatest Android and one of
[25:26.560 --> 25:29.840]  the to me weirdest things is and you know I've been trying
[25:29.840 --> 25:32.800]  to when I'm using it the days I'm using it. I try you know
[25:32.800 --> 25:38.080]  leave the iPhone at home just take the the moto X. The single
[25:38.080 --> 25:40.480]  weirdest thing to me out of well, there's two things that
[25:40.480 --> 25:44.480]  are really weird. One is not having I message is really
[25:44.480 --> 25:47.120]  awful because there's so many people now who I because I
[25:47.120 --> 25:49.440]  don't get text messages anymore. They're all I message
[25:49.440 --> 25:54.480]  so my phone is the one going off my phones and you know iPad
[25:54.480 --> 25:58.240]  are going off at home with the blue messages while my moto X,
[25:58.240 --> 26:00.880]  which has a different SIM card. You know isn't getting these
[26:00.880 --> 26:05.280]  messages and the second one is Apple pay like I every time I
[26:05.280 --> 26:07.760]  go to Whole Foods with that moto X in my pocket. I take it
[26:07.760 --> 26:11.040]  out of my pocket and then realize up. I actually have to
[26:11.040 --> 26:13.920]  go back and use my credit card like it's actually become a
[26:13.920 --> 26:16.960]  habit where I take the phone out before I even remember that
[26:16.960 --> 26:19.840]  oh, I'm walking around with the moto X. I can't use it. So
[26:19.840 --> 26:22.320]  that's that's interesting for me to hear because being over
[26:22.320 --> 26:25.440]  here right now where I'm in in London, it's not actually live
[26:25.440 --> 26:28.080]  yet. I think it might be testing in a few places, but I
[26:28.080 --> 26:30.320]  don't I haven't gone around and I haven't used it here. I
[26:30.320 --> 26:32.160]  haven't seen it really anywhere. It might be it might
[26:32.160 --> 26:34.720]  be starting to roll out at a few drug stores or they may
[26:34.720 --> 26:37.040]  have that sort of hack thing. You know where it will work
[26:37.040 --> 26:40.960]  with another NFC reader, but it's not officially supported
[26:40.960 --> 26:44.080]  yet and so the only times that I've gotten to use it has been
[26:44.080 --> 26:47.520]  when I'm back in San Francisco for work and so I've only
[26:47.520 --> 26:50.160]  gotten to use it probably three times or something and it's
[26:50.160 --> 26:54.000]  definitely you know it's it's all it was cracked up to be in
[26:54.000 --> 26:57.280]  my mind. It's you know just sort of a magical experience
[26:57.280 --> 27:00.960]  which it almost seems like it's a little bit crazy when you
[27:00.960 --> 27:03.520]  use it for the first time because it's like did I you
[27:03.520 --> 27:06.160]  know do I need are you sure I don't need to do anything else
[27:06.160 --> 27:09.600]  and sort of the cashier still ask you like yeah, I think I
[27:09.600 --> 27:13.360]  think you're good. It's still that that early stage period of
[27:13.360 --> 27:17.280]  the of the thing, but so you use it regularly and it's good
[27:17.280 --> 27:21.520]  to hear that it's it's sort of already in your daily flow.
[27:21.520 --> 27:24.160]  Where do you go besides Whole Foods that sort of uses it?
[27:24.160 --> 27:25.840]  There's like I know there's Walgreens and some of their
[27:25.840 --> 27:29.600]  bigger stores, but do do any like smaller things use it that
[27:29.600 --> 27:35.360]  you regular the smallest are the cabs the taxis in Philly
[27:35.360 --> 27:38.880]  that have that have and and that that's a perfect example
[27:38.880 --> 27:42.320]  of the sort of unofficial support for it where they have
[27:42.320 --> 27:45.760]  these. It doesn't have an Apple Pay logo. It just has a you
[27:45.760 --> 27:50.400]  know stick your phone at the terminal logo right right and
[27:50.400 --> 27:54.880]  it works there and that was a total surprise to me cuz I know
[27:54.880 --> 27:57.920]  I'd I'd read those stories that said you know just about any
[27:57.920 --> 28:02.720]  place that says you can pay by your phone. Apple Pay will work
[28:02.720 --> 28:06.800]  and it's it just in particular. It's it's so much more
[28:06.800 --> 28:09.200]  convenient cuz a lot of times when I'm in a cab, I've got my
[28:09.200 --> 28:11.600]  phone out because I'm bored while I'm riding in the cab and
[28:11.600 --> 28:15.920]  I'm you know on the phone and digging your wallet out while
[28:15.920 --> 28:18.880]  you're in the back seat of a cab is such a pain. You know
[28:18.880 --> 28:21.840]  it's like you're sitting there like a contortionist trying to
[28:21.840 --> 28:24.880]  get your stuff out and you don't want and then if you can
[28:24.880 --> 28:28.400]  just stick your phone at the thing, it's super great and
[28:28.400 --> 28:30.960]  then it it just gives you like a thing like what percent tip
[28:30.960 --> 28:34.800]  do you wanna give? You wanna give 18%? Yes. Boom. Yeah. Done
[28:34.800 --> 28:38.640]  and then you're out of the cab and maybe it gives cabs a you
[28:38.640 --> 28:41.120]  know a fighting chance against things like Uber and Lyft and
[28:41.120 --> 28:44.560]  whatnot cuz I have the problem where I have multiple times.
[28:44.560 --> 28:47.200]  Sadly enough, I take Uber so much that I will get out of a
[28:47.200 --> 28:51.520]  cab without realizing I have to pay and and it's very awkward
[28:51.520 --> 28:56.080]  and it seems like I'm I'm sort of crazy or I don't know what
[28:56.080 --> 29:01.680]  but yeah. Trying to scam them. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's you know
[29:01.680 --> 29:04.720]  what? That's the same sort of convenience though like Uber
[29:04.720 --> 29:09.840]  Uber is to taxi is what Apple pay is to credit cards. I mean
[29:09.840 --> 29:13.920]  it's you get used to that increased level of convenience
[29:13.920 --> 29:18.240]  and you forget you know it's it's it's hard to go back.
[29:18.240 --> 29:21.840]  Definitely. It's like trying to go back to you know an out
[29:21.840 --> 29:26.800]  house after you've had indoor plumbing. That's a good
[29:26.800 --> 29:30.160]  analogy. I like that. Or so I would imagine. Right. Right.
[29:30.160 --> 29:33.200]  Back in the 1800s when I remember. Right. Let me take a
[29:33.200 --> 29:37.760]  break and thank our first sponsor. Our first sponsor is
[29:37.760 --> 29:41.600]  once again our good friends at Fracture. Their website is
[29:41.600 --> 29:47.040]  fractureme.com. You guys know Fracture. I've talked about him
[29:47.040 --> 29:52.880]  before. These are the guys who you send them your photos and
[29:52.880 --> 29:57.360]  they print them directly on glass. I don't know how they do
[29:57.360 --> 30:00.640]  it. They've got like some kind of proprietary technology. They
[30:00.640 --> 30:03.200]  don't print them on paper and then put them in a frame
[30:03.200 --> 30:06.880]  underneath glass. They print them directly on the glass and
[30:06.880 --> 30:09.920]  then they mail them back to you in these really clever little
[30:09.920 --> 30:13.600]  cardboard kits that are self-contained things that you
[30:13.600 --> 30:16.880]  can either use as a prop stand like if you wanna put the
[30:16.880 --> 30:20.080]  photos on your desk or if you wanna hang them on a wall,
[30:20.080 --> 30:23.360]  they've got a thing on the back where you can put the hook but
[30:23.360 --> 30:26.160]  it's all self-contained. So, when they send them back to
[30:26.160 --> 30:29.040]  you, you don't have to go and buy a frame and put the
[30:29.040 --> 30:32.240]  fracture prints in a frame. Go to Ikea and get frames and
[30:32.240 --> 30:34.480]  stuff like that. You don't have to do any of that. What they
[30:34.480 --> 30:37.440]  send you is ready to hang on your wall, ready to put on your
[30:37.440 --> 30:43.840]  desk and they look awesome. I say this all the time that it's
[30:43.840 --> 30:47.920]  it's to me, it's like when they with the iPhone four when they
[30:47.920 --> 30:53.200]  first started laminating the LCD screen, the LED screen to
[30:53.200 --> 30:56.560]  the touch screen and it looked like the pixels were right on
[30:56.560 --> 30:59.200]  the glass instead of under the glass. That's exactly what
[30:59.200 --> 31:03.520]  prints from fracture look like except that it's completely
[31:03.520 --> 31:07.520]  analog. It's not you know, a gadget but that's the
[31:07.520 --> 31:11.920]  equivalent for printed pictures. Really, really good.
[31:11.920 --> 31:15.120]  They're a great gift idea. They're a great way to do
[31:15.120 --> 31:18.560]  things like Marco Arment's idea where he prints. He makes
[31:18.560 --> 31:21.760]  fracture prints square ones of all of his apps. If you have
[31:21.760 --> 31:25.280]  apps, if you make apps, make some fracture prints of your
[31:25.280 --> 31:29.920]  apps and you can use those as that you give out promotional
[31:29.920 --> 31:34.640]  giveaways or whatever. Just an amazing, amazing stuff. If
[31:34.640 --> 31:36.640]  you're gonna get your pictures printed, I can't imagine why
[31:36.640 --> 31:38.960]  you'd do it any other way than actually just sending them to
[31:38.960 --> 31:45.040]  fracture and doing it that way. I have them all over my
[31:45.040 --> 31:47.920]  house. I can't even count how many fractures we've got in the
[31:47.920 --> 31:50.640]  house now. It's pretty much all the pictures from the last few
[31:50.640 --> 31:54.800]  years that we have hanging up are fracture prints. Really,
[31:54.800 --> 32:00.720]  really good. You can save five bucks off your first order. If
[32:00.720 --> 32:04.240]  you use this code, Daring Fireball, all one word, Daring
[32:04.240 --> 32:08.720]  Fireball, use that code and you will save five bucks and the
[32:08.720 --> 32:12.800]  prices are already really, really good. So, go to
[32:12.800 --> 32:17.840]  fractureme.com. Get some prints and use this code Daring
[32:17.840 --> 32:20.720]  Fireball when you check out and you'll save five bucks. So, my
[32:20.720 --> 32:25.600]  thanks to Fracture. What I like about their site is that they
[32:25.600 --> 32:28.400]  compare, they show you the sizes and the comparison is
[32:28.400 --> 32:32.720]  always a Campbell's soup container. It's like it's good.
[32:32.720 --> 32:36.560]  It's sort of a random but interesting way to compare.
[32:36.560 --> 32:39.120]  Yeah and because it's like a universal, everybody knows how
[32:39.120 --> 32:42.720]  big a can of soup is. Yeah, I like that. Yeah, if you use a
[32:42.720 --> 32:44.720]  hand, I mean, some people's hands are way bigger than
[32:44.720 --> 32:53.520]  others. Yeah, it's true. So, Apple's financial results. Two
[32:53.520 --> 32:57.040]  of the points that really stick out to me. One is China and
[32:57.040 --> 33:02.400]  it's clearly a huge source of growth and one of the things
[33:02.400 --> 33:05.840]  that I've been thinking about with that and eight years in to
[33:05.840 --> 33:11.840]  the iPhone era. In the early years, it's stuck. It stood out
[33:11.840 --> 33:16.960]  a lot more but it still is an issue is the carriers, the
[33:16.960 --> 33:20.480]  carrier support and the growth of the iPhone in the early
[33:20.480 --> 33:24.480]  years, I think was clearly largely constrained by the
[33:24.480 --> 33:27.920]  number of carriers, you know, and especially around the
[33:27.920 --> 33:33.680]  world. I mean, it wasn't until was it 2010 or 2011 when
[33:33.680 --> 33:38.160]  Verizon first got the iPhone? I think 2011 but yeah. But it
[33:38.160 --> 33:40.480]  was, you know, it was a couple of years even in the US but at
[33:40.480 --> 33:43.200]  the very least, if you wanted an iPhone in the US, it wasn't
[33:43.200 --> 33:46.480]  hard. You could switch, you know, if you were on Verizon or
[33:46.480 --> 33:49.040]  on Sprint or T-Mobile or something, you'd have to switch
[33:49.040 --> 33:54.080]  to AT&T but, you know, say what you want about AT&T, at least
[33:54.080 --> 33:56.640]  they are a nationwide carrier. So, everybody could get an
[33:56.640 --> 34:00.480]  iPhone if you wanted an iPhone but around the world, it was a
[34:00.480 --> 34:04.480]  huge issue like growth in Japan was clearly constrained
[34:04.480 --> 34:08.640]  because they were on only on like the third biggest carrier
[34:08.640 --> 34:14.240]  in Japan for a long time. And China was a similar issue where
[34:14.240 --> 34:18.880]  they weren't on the biggest national carrier in China until
[34:18.880 --> 34:22.560]  fairly recently. Yeah, I think it's almost been just about a
[34:22.560 --> 34:24.560]  year, right? I think it's almost it's coming up in a year
[34:24.560 --> 34:30.160]  that China Mobile has been with them. Yeah. And as much as
[34:30.160 --> 34:33.200]  everybody, you know, and I, you know, I think the bigger screen
[34:33.200 --> 34:36.000]  sizes, especially in Asia, I mean, Tim Cook even called it
[34:36.000 --> 34:39.360]  out that it definitely varies by geography, how much you know,
[34:39.360 --> 34:43.520]  the mix between six and six plugs, it varies around the
[34:43.520 --> 34:48.160]  globe. I don't think it's any secret that in Asia, and China
[34:48.160 --> 34:52.080]  and Korea, and you know, that in those countries that the six
[34:52.080 --> 34:58.080]  plus is more popular than it is in other countries. So the big
[34:58.080 --> 35:00.880]  screen size is definitely part of it. But I think just the
[35:00.880 --> 35:07.360]  fact that it's available is almost overlooked. Yeah. What I
[35:07.360 --> 35:10.720]  find fascinating about that, like that the at the highest
[35:10.720 --> 35:14.800]  level is Apple, you know, there was there was definitely some
[35:14.800 --> 35:16.960]  questions when they were moving into the Chinese market, would
[35:16.960 --> 35:19.520]  they be able to compete? Would they be able to succeed? It's a
[35:19.520 --> 35:23.840]  high end product, you know, the difference in sort of buying
[35:23.840 --> 35:28.000]  power versus the United States, and all that kind of stuff. And
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.840]  you know, subsidies and all that. But now that it's clear
[35:31.840 --> 35:36.160]  that Apple's business is doing very well in China and growing
[35:36.160 --> 35:40.640]  very quickly, all of, you know, the sort of other tech
[35:40.640 --> 35:43.200]  companies that they're stacked up against in the United
[35:43.200 --> 35:48.880]  States, you know, that they're compared to, of course, Google
[35:48.880 --> 35:52.400]  and Facebook, and you know, even Twitter and some of these other
[35:52.400 --> 35:55.760]  things that are just hot properties right now. Most of
[35:55.760 --> 36:01.360]  them have no business in China, right? And Apple has a giant
[36:01.360 --> 36:05.040]  massive business that a lot of their competition, or what is
[36:05.040 --> 36:09.200]  viewed or often, you know, mentioned in the same breath as
[36:09.200 --> 36:12.400]  them, as their competition just doesn't really have that
[36:12.400 --> 36:16.560]  opportunity at all. Yeah, I completely agree. And this is
[36:16.560 --> 36:20.560]  another case where to me, Apple has been, if you're paying
[36:20.560 --> 36:25.120]  attention, very forthcoming about it for years now, I would
[36:25.120 --> 36:30.080]  say, at least during the entire Tim Cook era, like since Steve
[36:30.080 --> 36:36.160]  Jobs stepped down as CEO, and Tim Cook took the reins, I feel
[36:36.160 --> 36:39.120]  like quarter after quarter after quarter, Tim Cook has
[36:39.120 --> 36:42.480]  always made mention of China, even before China became it was
[36:42.480 --> 36:47.840]  almost like we're, you know, is he kept and continues to keep
[36:47.840 --> 36:52.480]  mentioning their growth in China. And it's, you know, again,
[36:52.480 --> 36:55.200]  it goes against the idea that Apple is super secretive.
[36:55.200 --> 36:58.560]  They've been very forthcoming about it. And now it's, I feel
[36:58.560 --> 37:02.640]  like they're at the point where it's, everybody's talking about
[37:02.640 --> 37:05.200]  it, because it's gotten to be an enormous part of their
[37:05.200 --> 37:08.800]  business. Yeah. And I wonder if part of that is just honestly
[37:08.800 --> 37:12.240]  because, you know, when he was still in charge of operations,
[37:12.240 --> 37:14.560]  he would go over there. I mean, that's where that's where all
[37:14.560 --> 37:17.200]  the operations were, you know, the majority of the operations
[37:17.200 --> 37:21.040]  were happening. And, you know, while China was always
[37:21.040 --> 37:23.440]  interesting to people, because of course, there's a billion
[37:23.440 --> 37:27.120]  and a half people there, it's the most populous country, and
[37:27.120 --> 37:29.600]  everyone knew that it was sort of coming online and becoming
[37:29.600 --> 37:33.680]  more prosperous and sort of becoming more affluent. You
[37:33.680 --> 37:36.400]  know, maybe his time on the ground there, he just knew like,
[37:36.400 --> 37:39.360]  no matter what, we have to figure this out. And we need to
[37:39.360 --> 37:43.120]  do what it takes to sort of crack this market, because
[37:43.120 --> 37:46.560]  eventually we will saturate the United States market and the
[37:46.560 --> 37:50.880]  European market, you know, not as big already. And so where
[37:50.880 --> 37:54.320]  are we going to find that growth? And they are positioned
[37:54.320 --> 37:58.560]  better than anyone right now to be able to exploit that.
[37:58.560 --> 38:03.760]  Yeah, the this is right from Apple's press release on their
[38:03.760 --> 38:07.440]  their results, international sales accounted for 65% of the
[38:07.440 --> 38:10.880]  quarters revenue. So exact, almost exactly two thirds of
[38:10.880 --> 38:15.280]  the revenue is outside the US now. And that's a big time,
[38:15.280 --> 38:18.560]  right? It used to be under it used to be under 50%. And then
[38:18.560 --> 38:22.320]  it was hovering around 50%. And now it's two thirds or whatnot,
[38:22.320 --> 38:27.360]  correct? Yeah, definitely is way up and a big change. Years
[38:27.360 --> 38:31.600]  ago, many years, let's say back before, especially before the
[38:31.600 --> 38:35.120]  iPhone existed, like in the first half of the last decade,
[38:36.560 --> 38:40.400]  the mobile market around the world was very unevenly
[38:40.400 --> 38:45.520]  distributed, where Blackberry had a huge share of the US, and
[38:45.520 --> 38:48.480]  was almost non existent elsewhere. And eventually,
[38:48.480 --> 38:52.320]  before Blackberry sort of imploded, they did get popular
[38:52.320 --> 38:55.280]  around the world. But I'm saying, you know, 10 years ago,
[38:55.280 --> 39:00.960]  Blackberry was almost like a US centric phenomenon. Right. And
[39:00.960 --> 39:05.600]  like Symbian was a European and Asian phenomenon and had no
[39:05.600 --> 39:09.120]  almost no footprint in the US. It was huge in Europe and in
[39:09.120 --> 39:13.120]  Asia, and almost non existent in the US, there weren't any
[39:13.120 --> 39:17.120]  major carriers that had Symbian phones and none of the US, you
[39:17.120 --> 39:20.320]  know, the companies that sold phones and the US carriers made
[39:20.320 --> 39:24.800]  Symbian phones, you know, it was weird. Right. And I always
[39:24.800 --> 39:30.720]  thought that Apple was a little not quite as, as, as totally
[39:30.720 --> 39:33.200]  US centric as Blackberry was then, but it was similar,
[39:33.200 --> 39:36.080]  though, where you, you know, the US was much, much stronger
[39:36.080 --> 39:41.280]  for Apple selling computers. Yeah, well, it's the rest of the
[39:41.280 --> 39:45.440]  world. It's sort of, it's, it's not direct, directly
[39:45.440 --> 39:47.680]  comparable, I guess, because obviously, Blackberry was big
[39:47.680 --> 39:51.120]  with business users, big in Washington, big on Wall Street.
[39:51.120 --> 39:54.400]  But it's the market was still the more affluent market.
[39:54.400 --> 39:58.080]  Right. And so they both sort of tracked to that market for a
[39:58.080 --> 40:04.560]  long time. Yeah. And I wonder, too, as time goes on, I mean,
[40:04.560 --> 40:07.520]  you know, Apple is always going to be a US company. I mean,
[40:07.520 --> 40:12.000]  it's, you know, I would say in a grand scheme, I think famously
[40:12.000 --> 40:16.960]  that they're, they're rather, you know, in terms of like, you
[40:16.960 --> 40:19.280]  know, they have some remote employees. But in general, if
[40:19.280 --> 40:21.600]  you work for Apple, you're working in Cupertino, if you're
[40:21.600 --> 40:24.400]  working on product development, you know, hardware or software,
[40:24.400 --> 40:26.160]  they don't really have, you know, the yes, they have,
[40:26.160 --> 40:30.640]  they've just started a Seattle office. They've had like, I
[40:30.640 --> 40:33.440]  think the I works team has been in Pittsburgh for a long time.
[40:33.440 --> 40:35.920]  So there's some people who and there's individuals who can get
[40:35.920 --> 40:38.240]  an exception and work remotely. But for the most part, people
[40:38.240 --> 40:40.640]  work there. It's it's always going to be a US company. The
[40:40.640 --> 40:46.960]  culture is very California centric. You know, I think that
[40:46.960 --> 40:49.760]  stamping, you know, designed by Apple in California and all
[40:49.760 --> 40:53.200]  their devices is actually very honest. It's that's who the
[40:53.200 --> 40:59.200]  company is. But I do wonder as time goes on. How much am you
[40:59.200 --> 41:01.680]  know, we're spoiled? Well, you're in London now. So I don't
[41:01.680 --> 41:05.360]  know. But I mean, I've always felt like I'm spoiled because
[41:05.360 --> 41:10.480]  everything comes out in the US on day one. Well, but I wonder
[41:10.480 --> 41:13.920]  how much you know, at what point will like China be on like
[41:13.920 --> 41:16.640]  the day one list for iPhone? Because I you know, it's
[41:16.640 --> 41:19.360]  clearly close enough that it made a big difference in the
[41:19.360 --> 41:22.880]  quarter. You know, yep. I agree. I mean, yeah, they and
[41:22.880 --> 41:25.280]  they I think they talked about that even in the release or
[41:25.280 --> 41:27.200]  something because it was it was two weeks later or something
[41:27.200 --> 41:29.920]  like that, that it that the iPhone came out in China. So it
[41:29.920 --> 41:32.800]  wasn't day one, but it was sort of the second wave, I think.
[41:32.800 --> 41:35.280]  And I actually think about that a lot when when I was moving
[41:35.280 --> 41:37.680]  over here, I'm like, Oh God, I'm gonna have to wait like a
[41:37.680 --> 41:41.440]  long time to to, you know, get get sort of the new products
[41:41.440 --> 41:43.440]  when they come out. But London's now, you know, sort of
[41:43.440 --> 41:46.800]  day one, they had the the new iPads came out the same thing.
[41:46.800 --> 41:48.960]  You know what this reminds me of, though, I think this this
[41:48.960 --> 41:53.920]  tracks with sort of the what Hollywood's going through as
[41:53.920 --> 41:57.280]  well, right. So for a long time, movies were released first in
[41:57.280 --> 42:00.800]  the US and then then they would go abroad like over a long
[42:00.800 --> 42:04.880]  period of time, sometimes months. Now, increasingly,
[42:04.880 --> 42:07.600]  they're tracking much closer to the US release date. In some
[42:07.600 --> 42:10.480]  cases, they get released abroad before they get released in the
[42:10.480 --> 42:13.760]  US and sort of to the to the point I think you're getting at,
[42:13.760 --> 42:18.720]  which is in Hollywood increasingly in of importance
[42:18.720 --> 42:23.200]  is the Asian markets for making the the actual money like, you
[42:23.200 --> 42:27.600]  know, the box office in the US is now often a minority piece
[42:27.600 --> 42:31.920]  of the pie compared to what they make overseas and so you're
[42:31.920 --> 42:34.800]  starting to see movies like Transformers and things that
[42:34.800 --> 42:39.200]  are more catering towards Asian audiences and I do wonder like,
[42:39.200 --> 42:42.080]  you know, when when that happens with Apple, when the
[42:42.080 --> 42:47.360]  tip happens fully that sort of the either the Asian markets or
[42:47.360 --> 42:51.440]  a combination of of Asia and some other, you know, areas
[42:51.440 --> 42:54.720]  around there end up being bigger than the US. Like, do
[42:54.720 --> 42:59.600]  they change the the company in any way to make it more focused
[42:59.600 --> 43:03.360]  on that region? Do they do sort of specific devices and I think
[43:03.360 --> 43:06.400]  we talked about this way back when that like, you know, in
[43:06.400 --> 43:08.560]  order to sell an iPhone in China, they would have to do
[43:08.560 --> 43:12.400]  like a special version of it or whatnot and then it it the
[43:12.400 --> 43:14.160]  notion was always that they would never do that. They would
[43:14.160 --> 43:16.880]  always just have sort of while they could while they change up
[43:16.880 --> 43:19.280]  the technology inside for the different carriers or whatever
[43:19.280 --> 43:21.760]  they would always they would never stray from having sort of
[43:21.760 --> 43:23.680]  a streamlined product line that's offered around the
[43:23.680 --> 43:30.160]  world. But does that change at all if China becomes like 75%
[43:30.160 --> 43:33.760]  of the business like in the future say I don't know. I
[43:33.760 --> 43:36.080]  don't know either but it's you know the fact that it's within
[43:36.080 --> 43:39.760]  two weeks is remarkable and you know again I think it's a
[43:39.760 --> 43:43.360]  combination of of multiple factors. I think it's the fact
[43:43.360 --> 43:48.400]  that they're now on you know the major carrier in China which
[43:48.400 --> 43:50.400]  makes a huge difference in terms of how many people can get
[43:50.400 --> 43:54.080]  it. I think the fact that China's economy is is growing
[43:54.080 --> 43:58.960]  and that there's an ever increasing number of Chinese
[43:58.960 --> 44:02.560]  citizens who have the kind of income that they could buy an
[44:02.560 --> 44:05.120]  iPhone. I mean clearly a majority of people in China
[44:05.120 --> 44:10.880]  can't right no no argument there but there's a you know you
[44:10.880 --> 44:14.800]  know take any percentage of how many billion people there are
[44:14.800 --> 44:18.160]  in China and if you know 10% or something like that is a huge
[44:18.160 --> 44:21.200]  number of people. Yeah, it's half the US already. That's
[44:21.200 --> 44:25.440]  right. It's it's just enormous. I think that they they they
[44:25.440 --> 44:27.760]  reported that they've you know they call it the BRIC
[44:27.760 --> 44:31.600]  countries Brazil, Russia, India, China, which is weird
[44:31.600 --> 44:34.480]  because they're very they're all very different but it's more
[44:34.480 --> 44:41.520]  or less four countries with a ton of people and you know wide
[44:41.520 --> 44:44.800]  income disparity. I guess yeah, but that they're doing well in
[44:44.800 --> 44:48.160]  all four of those countries. Yeah, I would I I haven't looked
[44:48.160 --> 44:50.880]  into it, but I would imagine that so India is probably the
[44:50.880 --> 44:53.280]  farthest behind that seems to be the case with you know
[44:53.280 --> 44:55.920]  basically everything because they're well, they also have a
[44:55.920 --> 44:58.480]  billion people there and I think they they would I think
[44:58.480 --> 45:02.240]  they're on pace to eventually eclipse China in terms of
[45:02.240 --> 45:06.800]  population, but while they so they do have a billion people
[45:06.800 --> 45:11.280]  right now well over a billion people right now the society is
[45:11.280 --> 45:14.800]  quite different there and you know it's still the iPhone is
[45:14.800 --> 45:18.160]  still viewed as a is way out of reach for most people, whereas
[45:18.160 --> 45:21.120]  in China, you know there's a there's as you mentioned,
[45:21.120 --> 45:23.920]  there's a growing segment of the population that can and is
[45:23.920 --> 45:27.360]  buying the iPhone right now. Yeah, and I think I think in
[45:27.360 --> 45:30.960]  broad strokes, that's exactly right that India it might be
[45:30.960 --> 45:35.440]  growing faster population wise, but that the the economy is
[45:35.440 --> 45:38.480]  nowhere near as strong as China's in terms of a growing,
[45:38.480 --> 45:42.960]  you know, Western style middle class and that's what Xiaomi
[45:42.960 --> 45:47.040]  right is going after India is like their big focus because
[45:47.040 --> 45:49.040]  they know that they have an opening there that Apple
[45:49.040 --> 45:52.560]  probably can't go after at least any time in the in the you
[45:52.560 --> 45:55.600]  know next couple of years or something right. I totally
[45:55.600 --> 45:58.080]  agree and I think that they have a great opportunity, but I
[45:58.080 --> 46:02.080]  feel like all of the and you still see it. You still see it
[46:02.080 --> 46:05.520]  where it's you know when Xiaomi comes out with something and
[46:05.520 --> 46:07.840]  it's what does it mean for Apple? How can Apple compete
[46:07.840 --> 46:12.480]  it's to me? They're a huge problem for Samsung and for all
[46:12.480 --> 46:15.840]  the other hand Android handset makers and yeah, not that
[46:15.840 --> 46:21.280]  they're irrelevant to Apple, but it's it's all in that
[46:21.280 --> 46:24.560]  segment underneath what Apple is targeting. That's right. I
[46:24.560 --> 46:27.760]  mean just look at what what has happened to Samsung. They've
[46:27.760 --> 46:30.400]  been well. They're you know they're still making a lot of
[46:30.400 --> 46:34.560]  money. Their growth has been just just totally eaten into
[46:34.560 --> 46:39.360]  and likely by Xiaomi and Apple of course at the at the top
[46:39.360 --> 46:42.400]  end, but they're being squeezed. You know not unlike
[46:42.400 --> 46:45.680]  Microsoft is squeezed in the US from sort of you know the
[46:45.680 --> 46:48.720]  Chrome OS on the low end and and you know MacBook still
[46:48.720 --> 46:51.600]  sales rising. It's the same thing just happened just in a
[46:51.600 --> 46:54.480]  very condensed time to Samsung. It's it's sort of incredible
[46:54.480 --> 46:57.680]  how fast it happened to Samsung, but you know they're in
[46:57.680 --> 47:00.000]  they're in this like precarious situation right now because of
[47:00.000 --> 47:03.760]  that. Yeah, I actually I think Samsung revenue and profits are
[47:03.760 --> 47:09.360]  actually down, not just stagnant. Okay. Yeah. They just
[47:09.360 --> 47:14.560]  reported their results. Hold on. Let me Google it sure. One
[47:14.560 --> 47:19.200]  other thing about China is I wonder so another thing about
[47:19.200 --> 47:21.680]  the Chinese market that that you hear come up time and time
[47:21.680 --> 47:24.480]  again is actually that that the watch industry is pretty
[47:24.480 --> 47:28.480]  massive. There is as the the population grows in affluence,
[47:28.480 --> 47:31.280]  they're sort of looking to these different traditional
[47:31.280 --> 47:35.040]  traditional areas of affluence like wine and and watches of
[47:35.040 --> 47:39.280]  course is one and so what does that mean for Apple watch
[47:39.280 --> 47:44.400]  there and I don't know but it could mean major things if if
[47:44.400 --> 47:49.040]  the product is successful that you know it becomes if maybe
[47:49.040 --> 47:51.200]  from day one, it's a bigger seller in China than it is in
[47:51.200 --> 47:56.240]  the US. Yeah, I think so. I don't know if I've mentioned
[47:56.240 --> 47:58.400]  this on the show before I saw a documentary a couple months
[47:58.400 --> 48:02.160]  ago. It was great. It's it's on iTunes called Red Obsession.
[48:02.160 --> 48:05.280]  Have you seen this? No, it's it's about the wine industry.
[48:07.360 --> 48:10.640]  Great documentary. Just note the name Red Obsession, but the
[48:10.640 --> 48:16.560]  gist of it is about how the Asian market has completely
[48:16.560 --> 48:23.840]  disrupted the sale and price of wine like that they'll go in.
[48:23.840 --> 48:27.360]  There's Chinese buyers of wholesale wine who will go into
[48:27.360 --> 48:34.880]  like you know high-end French. What do you call a wine maker?
[48:34.880 --> 48:40.960]  Not a distillery. What's the word? Winery? Yeah, winery and
[48:40.960 --> 48:43.520]  just buy they'll they'll they would just come in and just say
[48:43.520 --> 48:46.080]  like we'll buy all of it. We'll just take it all and they're
[48:46.080 --> 48:49.200]  like what and they're like we'll just take all of all this
[48:49.200 --> 48:52.960]  is great. Your your wine this year is this this you know this
[48:52.960 --> 48:56.800]  Bordeaux is fantastic. Just give it you know just send all of
[48:56.800 --> 48:59.200]  it to China. That's it all of it and then you know like
[48:59.200 --> 49:02.400]  there's people who are used to buying the wine from this place
[49:02.400 --> 49:05.680]  in America and you know elsewhere in Europe and they're
[49:05.680 --> 49:07.680]  like what do you mean you don't have any and they're like we
[49:07.680 --> 49:11.680]  sold it all to China. That's it. I have I have a very I have
[49:11.680 --> 49:14.720]  a first-hand account of that. I was you know being being
[49:14.720 --> 49:17.040]  situated in Europe. Now it's pretty easy to obviously get
[49:17.040 --> 49:19.680]  around and go places like Paris and I think we were in
[49:19.680 --> 49:23.680]  Switzerland over the summer and we're in a small little
[49:23.680 --> 49:28.320]  vineyard place in the middle of nowhere and we are there with
[49:28.320 --> 49:30.960]  the only other people in the room is a is a Chinese family
[49:30.960 --> 49:35.600]  sort of tasting the wine and you look around and we were you
[49:35.600 --> 49:38.800]  know thinking about buying a bottle or whatever. They had so
[49:38.800 --> 49:44.320]  few bottles that were actually you know earmarked that could
[49:44.320 --> 49:48.560]  be sold to sort of people who walk in. So much was earmarked
[49:48.560 --> 49:51.280]  to go to China and they even print Chinese labels and this
[49:51.280 --> 49:54.080]  is you know in the middle of Switzerland and it's like
[49:54.080 --> 49:58.160]  they're this little this little winery we're in they are
[49:58.160 --> 50:01.760]  experiencing. You know just what you're talking about where
[50:01.760 --> 50:05.040]  they just know that their market now is basically China
[50:05.040 --> 50:07.440]  is a huge part of it. I don't know what the percentage was,
[50:07.440 --> 50:10.880]  but say it's 75% and then the rest of the world is like 25% so
[50:10.880 --> 50:13.840]  they they store some for you know for the rest of the world,
[50:13.840 --> 50:16.320]  but then the most of it is just is just going to be sent to
[50:16.320 --> 50:19.760]  China right and you know extrapolate from that. What
[50:19.760 --> 50:24.160]  happens if China if their economy keeps growing and a
[50:24.160 --> 50:28.560]  bigger and bigger percentage of their citizens grow into what
[50:28.560 --> 50:31.040]  we would consider like middle or upper class, you know
[50:31.040 --> 50:34.080]  incomes and you know the potential for growth. There is
[50:34.080 --> 50:37.680]  just phenomenal and so what does so do I mean like the
[50:37.680 --> 50:41.600]  Apple Watch really could be the first product. That's that's a
[50:41.600 --> 50:45.520]  massive hits in China bigger than it is in the US and like
[50:45.520 --> 50:48.320]  that's that's weird to think about right that there would be
[50:48.320 --> 50:51.760]  it's always been that the US has sort of been the the the
[50:51.760 --> 50:55.600]  leader ahead of ahead of the game. I guess in terms of Apple
[50:55.600 --> 50:57.840]  and technology and then the rest of the world sort of
[50:57.840 --> 51:01.360]  catches on by stages and that doesn't also just mean in
[51:01.360 --> 51:04.400]  terms of the US being more affluent and having you know
[51:04.400 --> 51:07.760]  more buying power or whatever sometimes it's just you know
[51:07.760 --> 51:10.720]  they it's everything from the Apple releases the products
[51:10.720 --> 51:15.760]  here first that traditionally they have to you know every
[51:15.760 --> 51:19.760]  being sort of the the benefits of scale and so everyone you
[51:19.760 --> 51:23.360]  know has an iPhone and so you can use things like like
[51:23.360 --> 51:26.640]  airdrop and things like that and so it becomes and and I
[51:26.640 --> 51:30.000]  message and so it becomes a more compelling option, but it
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.200]  hasn't been that another country has really taken off
[51:33.200 --> 51:37.280]  first and I don't think that it's a crazy notion that Apple
[51:37.280 --> 51:40.560]  Watch could be one of those things. Yeah. I don't think so
[51:40.560 --> 51:47.840]  either and I think that the the gold models the addition level
[51:47.840 --> 51:53.680]  plays right into that and that's right. You know it. It's
[51:53.680 --> 51:57.840]  totally like a feel thing, not a think thing. It doesn't make
[51:57.840 --> 52:00.640]  logical sense right. It logically it makes no sense for
[52:00.640 --> 52:04.480]  anybody to buy the gold version of the watch. If the aluminum
[52:04.480 --> 52:08.480]  one does the exact same function at $350, but that's
[52:08.480 --> 52:13.760]  jewelry. Jewelry is entirely a you know how it makes you feel
[52:13.760 --> 52:16.560]  type thing not like a logical thing. Nobody needs any kind of
[52:16.560 --> 52:20.080]  jewelry. That's right and you know it's a you know it's a
[52:20.080 --> 52:23.120]  long standing. You know it's you know it goes back to the
[52:23.120 --> 52:26.160]  beginnings of human civilization. It's you know
[52:26.160 --> 52:30.560]  there's no you can't argue with it, but I feel like in America
[52:30.560 --> 52:34.800]  it's you know, let's just say when they when they do come out
[52:34.800 --> 52:36.880]  with the watch and they announce the final pricing and
[52:36.880 --> 52:41.520]  let's say that the addition ones are $4,000. There's I'm
[52:41.520 --> 52:44.080]  telling you. I still think even after all these months of
[52:44.080 --> 52:46.080]  people saying hey, I think these gold ones might cost
[52:46.080 --> 52:48.080]  thousands of dollars. I think these gold ones might cost
[52:48.080 --> 52:50.400]  thousands of dollars when they announce it. I'm telling you in
[52:50.400 --> 52:52.880]  America. People are gonna **** their pants. Oh yeah. They're
[52:52.880 --> 52:56.400]  gonna be like I cannot. I cannot freaking believe this
[52:56.400 --> 52:59.200]  that you know they're out of they've Johnny Ive has lost his
[52:59.200 --> 53:02.400]  freaking mind. You know why in the world is anybody gonna and
[53:02.400 --> 53:06.480]  in the meantime people in China and in Asia, you know other
[53:06.480 --> 53:09.760]  places in Asia are gonna start lining up to buy them. Oh yeah.
[53:09.760 --> 53:13.840]  I totally agree with you. I mean it could be it's because
[53:13.840 --> 53:17.520]  it's just there needs to be a mindset change, which only can
[53:17.520 --> 53:20.880]  happen sort of over time. I think everyone including me
[53:20.880 --> 53:23.120]  even when I think about it. I'm viewing this as a technology
[53:23.120 --> 53:25.920]  product. What technology product will I would I buy
[53:25.920 --> 53:29.840]  these days that cost say five four or $5,000. I mean it used
[53:29.840 --> 53:32.640]  to be televisions cost that much now they don't anymore.
[53:32.640 --> 53:35.440]  They've come down in price a lot. It used to be computers
[53:35.440 --> 53:37.520]  cost that much now they don't anymore. They're about half
[53:37.520 --> 53:41.440]  that price for a high-end one and so what else is there out
[53:41.440 --> 53:44.240]  there in the technology world that would cost that amount of
[53:44.240 --> 53:47.760]  money. I mean trying to think of something now and I can't
[53:47.760 --> 53:50.560]  really come up with anything right and so this all of a
[53:50.560 --> 53:54.080]  sudden the small little gadget becomes the most expensive
[53:54.080 --> 53:57.440]  piece of technology that you can buy on the market and why
[53:57.440 --> 53:59.680]  on earth would anyone do that when you can also get
[53:59.680 --> 54:03.200]  basically the same thing you know for $350 for the sport
[54:03.200 --> 54:06.960]  edition or whatnot and yeah. It's exactly what you said you
[54:06.960 --> 54:09.760]  have to the mentality has to shift around it that this is
[54:09.760 --> 54:13.760]  actually jewelry and that's I mean you know that's why Apple
[54:13.760 --> 54:16.160]  is doing what they're doing and that's why they're hiring the
[54:16.160 --> 54:20.000]  people that they're hiring. Obviously there's some serious
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.800]  cultural differences too where and I'm not an expert on it. I
[54:22.800 --> 54:25.920]  mean Ben Ben Thompson is he lives over there, but I mean I
[54:25.920 --> 54:29.360]  know enough about Asia though to know that they're they're
[54:29.360 --> 54:33.360]  culturally their view of money is very different than us in
[54:33.360 --> 54:37.520]  the West in the West. Not that we're ashamed of it, but it's
[54:37.520 --> 54:40.960]  money is considered like a private matter. You don't flaunt
[54:40.960 --> 54:43.760]  if you're wealthy, it's considered uncouth to flaunt
[54:43.760 --> 54:47.600]  it right and in Asia, that's not the case at all. So like I
[54:47.600 --> 54:49.840]  remember specifically like when the watch was first announced,
[54:49.840 --> 54:54.080]  I was listening to accidental tech podcast and Marco Arment
[54:54.080 --> 54:56.160]  had just said something something I think in reference
[54:56.160 --> 55:00.240]  to the gold one that like if he was at WWDC next year after the
[55:00.240 --> 55:03.280]  watch was out, he would be embarrassed to be out like you
[55:03.280 --> 55:06.160]  know having cocktails at five or six in the afternoon after
[55:06.160 --> 55:10.720]  WWDC and have a gold watch. If everybody could know it was
[55:10.720 --> 55:14.000]  $4000 and I know exactly what he's talking about. I know you
[55:14.000 --> 55:17.520]  know I sort of feel the same way whereas in Asia that
[55:17.520 --> 55:20.000]  wouldn't nobody would ever that nobody would ever say that
[55:20.000 --> 55:22.240]  nobody would ever say I'm embarrassed to have what
[55:22.240 --> 55:25.920]  everybody knows is a $4000 watch on my wrist right. Yeah.
[55:25.920 --> 55:28.800]  No, that's a that's a great point. I mean and I think
[55:28.800 --> 55:31.600]  that's true. You see that even before the watch like when you
[55:31.600 --> 55:35.280]  know when you buy when you buy one of the new iPhones for the
[55:35.280 --> 55:38.240]  first time, you know day one you get it and you know that
[55:38.240 --> 55:42.000]  like plenty of people all know that this is especially say
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.400]  with the six plus because it's such a different size and so
[55:44.400 --> 55:46.800]  everyone's like looking at that like wow that guy just dropped
[55:46.800 --> 55:51.440]  you know whatever $700 to get that that phone and I'm still
[55:51.440 --> 55:54.560]  stuck here with the with the three GS model and you know one
[55:54.560 --> 55:57.200]  day you know I hope to get that but there's there's already
[55:57.200 --> 56:00.480]  that sort of that sort of thing where you're you're looking at
[56:00.480 --> 56:02.080]  this. It's like yeah, everyone's gonna know that I
[56:02.080 --> 56:05.440]  just spent $700 and it's even though it's an awesome device
[56:05.440 --> 56:07.520]  and and I wanna use it out there. It's like should I
[56:07.520 --> 56:09.520]  really take this out of my pocket here and you know sort
[56:09.520 --> 56:14.320]  of flaunt it in front of everyone. Yeah. Let's take a
[56:14.320 --> 56:16.560]  break. I'm gonna thank our second sponsor. It's our good
[56:16.560 --> 56:20.320]  friends at Backblaze. You guys know Backblaze. I've been
[56:20.320 --> 56:22.800]  talking about him for months. I can't believe everybody who
[56:22.800 --> 56:26.320]  listens to the show hasn't signed up for it yet. It's
[56:26.320 --> 56:32.080]  online cloud-based unlimited backup for your Mac. You sign
[56:32.080 --> 56:35.440]  up for Backblaze. You get a month free to sign up. No
[56:35.440 --> 56:40.560]  credit card. You install their app. Simple little Mac app
[56:40.560 --> 56:43.440]  written by former Apple engineers runs perfectly
[56:43.440 --> 56:45.680]  quietly. It doesn't doesn't interfere with anything. You
[56:45.680 --> 56:49.680]  install it. Forget about it. It backs up everything on your
[56:49.680 --> 56:53.600]  Mac to your Backblaze account in the cloud. Everything. Your
[56:53.600 --> 56:55.600]  entire startup drive. Do you have an external hard drive?
[56:55.600 --> 56:58.320]  It'll back that up too. Everything. Doesn't matter how
[56:58.320 --> 57:01.440]  much you have. Unlimited. There's no size limit. There is
[57:01.440 --> 57:05.440]  no catch. There's no pricing tier for more storage. However
[57:05.440 --> 57:09.200]  much you have to back up. You just back it up. You just
[57:09.200 --> 57:12.800]  install Backblaze and then as soon as it uploads, it's all
[57:12.800 --> 57:17.760]  there. Everything. Then, once it's all backed up, if
[57:17.760 --> 57:22.560]  disaster strikes, if your hard drive fails, if your MacBook
[57:22.560 --> 57:29.520]  gets stolen, if you spill water on your MacBook, you can get a
[57:29.520 --> 57:33.520]  complete restore of your system. You don't have to
[57:33.520 --> 57:36.080]  download it even either. You can just log in and have them
[57:36.080 --> 57:39.760]  put it on a USB hard drive and mail it to you. They'll FedEx
[57:39.760 --> 57:42.800]  FedEx it to you one day later. You've got your whole thing on
[57:42.800 --> 57:47.120]  a USB drive right there in your hands or it's not just for
[57:47.120 --> 57:51.040]  disaster. Maybe you just need one file but your computer's at
[57:51.040 --> 57:53.520]  home and you've got your phone. Well, they've got an app. You
[57:53.520 --> 57:57.680]  fire up the app on your iPhone and you can access every file
[57:57.680 --> 58:01.840]  on your system right there from the iPhone and mail it or text
[58:01.840 --> 58:04.160]  it or share it. However you want right there from your
[58:04.160 --> 58:10.000]  phone. A huge majority of the use of Backblaze is you know
[58:10.000 --> 58:16.960]  one file at a time. They've got years of experience. I don't
[58:16.960 --> 58:19.120]  even know. I don't even know the word for how much they have
[58:19.120 --> 58:21.680]  backed up terabytes. It's whatever is bigger than
[58:21.680 --> 58:27.760]  terabytes petabytes. I think it's such a great thing. I've
[58:27.760 --> 58:31.280]  got it. I've been using it forever. I would wholeheartedly
[58:31.280 --> 58:33.680]  recommend it even if they weren't a sponsor of the show.
[58:33.680 --> 58:37.760]  Just install it put it on your parents machine. That way their
[58:37.760 --> 58:42.800]  whole system is backed up offline outside the house. It's
[58:42.800 --> 58:45.360]  just a remarkable peace of mind when you know that everything
[58:45.360 --> 58:51.040]  on your system is backed up and it's just 5 bucks a month per
[58:51.040 --> 58:55.280]  Mac 5 bucks a month and you have everything backed up safe
[58:55.280 --> 58:59.840]  and sound outside your house in the cloud. Where do you go? Go
[58:59.840 --> 59:05.120]  to backblaze.com slash daring fireball slash daring fireball
[59:05.120 --> 59:08.720]  and that way they'll know you came from the show. So
[59:08.720 --> 59:11.920]  Backblaze go sign up for.
[59:11.920 --> 59:20.480]  Here's another thing about the. The iPhone II want to talk to
[59:20.480 --> 59:26.480]  you about this kind of know you've written about it. The
[59:26.480 --> 59:31.200]  iPhone 5C I think is the most misunderstood iPhone that
[59:31.200 --> 59:35.600]  Apple's ever made. Do you what do you do you think the iPhone
[59:35.600 --> 59:41.680]  5C? What do you think the point of the iPhone 5C? So I thought
[59:41.680 --> 59:45.040]  my my thoughts have changed. I don't know obviously. I mean
[59:45.040 --> 59:51.040]  I've I haven't talked to anyone sort of with first hand
[59:51.040 --> 59:55.520]  knowledge of this of like what the point was and I don't know.
[59:55.520 --> 59:57.920]  I don't have a good enough sense of that to know for sure,
[59:57.920 --> 01:00:01.520]  but my thought process has changed over time. You know at
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:04.320]  first you know everyone is talking about it. Of course is
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:07.120]  the is the quote unquote cheap iPhone, which ended up being
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:14.720]  incorrect and then it became sort of the first product that
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:19.360]  was launched under the unified Johnny I've you know sort of
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:22.640]  design and software and hardware design at Apple right.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:27.280]  So it was iOS 7 and you know we got the new flat design the
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.960]  colorful sort of fluorescent look and those those phones
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.240]  seem to go nicely with that right. I still think even I
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:38.640]  still have you know a blue model of the iPhone of the
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:43.280]  iPhone 5C that I still think is I know I'm sort of in the
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.520]  minority here, but I thought it was a beautiful device when
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.320]  paired with iOS 7 at the time. I don't even know if I've
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.720]  upgraded it to iOS 8. It's sitting in a in a drawer
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:54.080]  somewhere obviously with with iPhone 6 out now, but I thought
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.960]  it was a beautiful device and sort of you know the way it
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.520]  played with sort of the wallpapers that they had for for
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.720]  iOS 7 and it just seemed like it was it was a device that
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:05.760]  Johnny I've wanted to create to showcase the new software
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:10.880]  that he was creating for the first time. Whereas the iPhone
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:15.840]  5S was you know also you know a great design great industrial
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:19.040]  design, but different. It was sort of the extension of what
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.480]  they had already done before doing this new software and so
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:27.120]  that was my thought process for a while. Then you know Apple
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:30.160]  just didn't sort of continue the line right and so now we
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:33.680]  have the six and the six plus and we have no we have three
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:37.920]  colors, three sort of tints each of those, but no no more
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:42.800]  colorful range anymore and now we're sort of going towards as
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.280]  we head towards Apple Watch where that's obviously going to
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:50.080]  be the most customizable Apple device that Apple's ever done.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.400]  You know, maybe that's enough to sort of placate the people
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:57.200]  who want a different type of design and and I don't know
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:00.720]  what are your what are your thoughts on it? I I feel like I
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:04.800]  feel like I gave myself credit for not really buying into the
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:09.440]  whole like it leaked months in advance that they were doing a
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:13.440]  plastic phone and that's just inevitable when you're making
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:16.800]  things in this quantity that it the news leaks from the Asian
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.160]  supply chain and every you know not everybody, but the the
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:23.280]  conventional wisdom was oh Apple's going after cheap the
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:26.080]  cheap market. They're going to sell this thing cheap cheap
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:29.200]  cheap and then it wasn't cheap. It was like you know unlocked.
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:34.720]  It was started at like 550 bucks, which is not by anybody's
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:37.680]  you know it's certainly cheaper than the five S was, but it
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:41.040]  wasn't cheap and I never bought into that. It never made sense
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:45.440]  to me that Apple would suddenly lurch after the low end of the
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.640]  market and just go for market share. So I gave my you know
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:52.640]  padded myself on the back for getting the five C just because
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:55.600]  I didn't never bought into it being cheap, but I think I
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:58.560]  missed the boat, though. I think just by just by thinking
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:02.560]  well. It's not going to be cheap isn't enough and I almost
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:07.280]  feel like in hindsight when it came out, it wasn't even it not
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:10.720]  that they didn't want to sell it in the first year, but it
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:15.120]  almost wasn't even meant for that year. I think it was meant
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:19.760]  for the long haul and like where it is now like at the you
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:26.320]  know the free with contract level of right iPhone that it
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:31.200]  had you know the new aspect ratio for the screen. It wasn't
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.680]  three and a half inches. It was four inches and sixteen by
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:39.920]  nine and the you know I do think I agree with you. I think
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.640]  they're proud of the industrial design of it. I think Apple
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:46.080]  really likes that look and I think again. I think you're
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:49.520]  right. I think it's very astute that it it does seem to be
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:53.680]  much more in harmony with the aesthetics of iOS seven and
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:04:02.000]  eight than the aluminum. Phones the five S and the sixes and I
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.160]  know a lot of people not tons, but I know enough you know who
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:10.480]  who have the five C because they just they like the way it
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.440]  looks right even though it was slower even though it wasn't
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:16.800]  as fast. Yeah. Yeah that you know that there that the iPhone
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:20.400]  is sort of gotten to the point where you know whatever the
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.320]  difference in performances doesn't matter. They're not
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:24.880]  waiting for anything anyway. It doesn't take any longer.
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.440]  You're mostly waiting for stuff to download right. Instagram
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:30.640]  doesn't run slower on the five seats. You're just waiting for
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:35.040]  the pictures to come down the pipe. Yeah, they just like the
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.680]  way it looks and I almost feel it was all about like
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:43.040]  establishing an aesthetic that fits at the lower end of the
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:47.040]  product lineup so that they don't have the free with contract
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:51.680]  phone being a premium. Yeah, that's a really interesting
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.560]  thought. I totally understand what you're what you're saying
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:59.200]  there because it it it's weird when you buy something brand
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:03.280]  new like say the the six now and then you know in two years
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:06.000]  this is going to be viewed as sort of the the quote unquote
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.320]  whether it's fair or not the cheap version right it's going
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:12.800]  to not only will it we all know things degrade in value over
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:16.640]  time as they're sort of used and everything but it's weird
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:20.320]  the the notion that the as soon as you buy it you know that in
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:25.520]  two years this will be on you know sort of Verizon ad spreads
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:30.560]  saying like free and this is this is the cheap version now
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:34.720]  and so if Apple can get around that by creating a product
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:38.720]  that's sort of separate from the high end to begin with from
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.360]  the high end meeting their actual most expensive things
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.320]  even though as we just talked about it's not that much cheaper
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:47.440]  that creates a different sort of psychological dynamic to it.
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:51.120]  I also think and I so I had written a post a long time ago
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:55.600]  maybe a year ago I guess talking about like how odd it is
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:06:00.160]  that every advertisement I see around I think it was around
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.480]  still San Francisco and sort of I think it was in Seattle
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.960]  actually when I saw one that sort of made me think about
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:09.920]  this that every ad I was seeing was for the iPhone 5C and not
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:12.960]  the 5S there were a few ads for the 5S but almost all of them
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:16.240]  are certainly around the Bay Area were for the 5C and I at
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:19.040]  first I interpreted that as it must not be selling well and
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:21.360]  Apple feels like they need to pump up the advertising to sort
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:23.520]  of boost it up and that may have been the case I don't
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:25.680]  really know but I did get a lot of pushback for it and I think
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:30.240]  some of it was astute pushback thinking like actually this is
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.160]  sort of the perfect device along the lines of what we were
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.800]  just talking about this is sort of the perfect device for Apple
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.720]  to showcase in their advertisements because it's
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:40.160]  colorful it sort of goes perfectly with iOS 7 it's it's
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:44.640]  sort of part of this the playful ads that Apple likes to
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:48.720]  do and so it ended up being in a way like the the poster child
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:52.320]  for a long time for for all those ads around different
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.320]  cities in the US certainly in the US I don't know about the
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:58.320]  rest of the world and what if it was like you know just sort
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:01.440]  of a product that they thought was really beautiful and they
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:04.320]  knew that it could sort of get people in the stores by having
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:07.360]  these colorful ads and then you know then either they buy
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:09.840]  this device and that's great for them or they you know they
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:13.040]  decide to to buy the more expensive device. Yeah I
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:15.040]  remember that post and it's actually why I brought it up
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:17.280]  with you. I don't know how I'll look it up and I'll put it in
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:19.040]  the show notes but I do remember that post and I
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.920]  remember disagreeing with it because it was right around the
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:26.240]  time when it first started dawning on me that I had I had
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:29.520]  underestimated the five C and like I said, I think that this
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:33.520]  year is the year where the five C is exactly where Apple
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:37.520]  wants it to be. I feel like it's it. I feel like the
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.760]  hardest part of Apple's business is now that they're
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:45.200]  they've hit these insane quantities for iPhones. It's
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:48.560]  really really hard and they're their pipeline is so long like
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:52.400]  how do you how do you ship 74 million new iPhones and who
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:55.040]  knows what percentage of them were the iPhone six, but it's a
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:57.760]  I think it's a majority of them last quarter. How do you make
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:02.880]  that many in the first quarter that it's available? Well part
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:06.080]  of the how they do it is that it's planned out years in
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:10.320]  advance. I mean like I think it's about a two year pipeline
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:14.800]  for their iPhones. You know like more or less that the
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:17.920]  iPhone six and six plus were you know about 2 years in the
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:21.040]  making and it's dangerous for them and I feel like that's
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.240]  partly why they're I think in hindsight they were probably a
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:28.400]  year late to the big phone market. I think that if they
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:30.960]  could if they could go back and do everything over again, I
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:34.240]  think that they would probably put the iPhone six and six plus
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:37.920]  one year ahead on the schedule cuz it was but it it takes too
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:41.120]  long for them to get everything set up so they can make these
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:45.520]  quantities. They can't act fast and just say okay. We'll make a
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:48.160]  you know a five and a half inch phone, but we're only gonna be
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:50.640]  able to make a million of them because it's new and we're not
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.880]  ready for it. Well. they can't do that. They can't have a
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:54.960]  phone that they can only make a million of in the first
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:59.440]  quarter. Yeah, I agree, but I feel like the five C was
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:04.160]  something where they were thinking ahead over a year and
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:08.160]  they wanted to have a phone that sat at this sort of you
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.560]  know and well. In fact, they've gone to four levels right.
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:14.640]  They've got the six plus, which is $100 more for the same specs
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.920]  compared to the six. So they've got the six plus where you pay
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:23.440]  $100 premium for the bigger screen with the extra pixels.
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:27.440]  Then there's the six, which sits where it the iPhone always
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:32.240]  had the new iPhones always have same price levels. Then one cut
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:36.880]  down $100 down is the five S, which is still a premium
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:41.120]  device right. The five S is and you know we we could do a whole
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:43.120]  show about it, but in my opinion is still my favorite
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:48.400]  iPhone that they've ever made. And now the five C at that free
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:52.000]  with contract level is so much more natural than if they were
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.200]  selling if they had stuck to the original plan and hadn't
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:00.000]  made this one device that is so unusual with you know the
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.680]  plastic body and it never was at the high end. You know
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:06.320]  effectively, though the five C is where if they had stuck to
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.640]  the plan and done the same thing they've done every other
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:11.840]  year, that would still be the the original iPhone five
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:17.600]  without the S right and instead, which is like visually
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:20.480]  indistinguishable from the five S accepted. You know it
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:24.400]  doesn't have touch ID, but at a glance it looks the same,
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:29.120]  whereas now it at a glance. It's instantly recognizable as
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:31.440]  yes, that's a that's a good point. I've definitely yeah.
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:33.120]  I've thought I've brought. I think I've written about that
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:36.880]  as well. That sort of notion as well that there was the problem
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:41.200]  with the S lines where they look the same and so it's not
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:45.760]  it's like well. Yes, they're faster inside like what is what
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.480]  is it that's sort of differentiating on the outside.
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:51.280]  There was nothing for a while and now the five C gives you a
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:55.440]  very differentiated factor, but what do you think? Then you
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:59.280]  know sort of the the obvious lead into that is what do you
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:03.120]  think they end up doing the next iteration? So we're coming
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:09.280]  up on you know the fall of 2015. The assumption I would
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:15.760]  assume is that they do an iPhone six S and then do they
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:19.520]  have an iPhone six C and what do they do with them? Do they
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:24.880]  have a plus S and how do they keep the line going to be
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:29.280]  right? How big would it be? Would it be 4.7 inches or would
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:32.560]  it be 5.5? Would it be both? I don't think it would be both. I
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:36.640]  think that they it's an excellent question. I'm really
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.600]  kind of at a loss to guess what they're going to do this year
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:43.440]  like I kind of guess they're going to do at the high end six
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:47.280]  S and a six S plus which would be this look a lot like the you
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:53.360]  know just the typical S. You know tick tock revisions right
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.920]  but then what do they do at that pricing level below where
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:01.040]  the five S is now and I really wonder do they keep the six and
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:04.560]  six plus and you know I don't think so. We're getting pretty
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.120]  convoluted then at that point as to what the what the
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:10.800]  offerings are. Yeah. I don't think so. I kind of feel and I
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:15.200]  kind of feel like the way that they're and it's somewhat
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:19.200]  contrary because I don't think that the actual cost is that
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:22.400]  much different for the different sizes, but I kind of
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:26.800]  feel like they'll if I had to guess maybe like they'll call
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:31.680]  it a six C and it would be a four inch screen but with the
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:35.760]  specs of the iPhone six. So that's interesting because one
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:38.320]  thing that has always been humorous to me for the past
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.960]  couple of years now remember when the iPhone first came out
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:45.920]  and everyone was clamoring like we need an iPhone nano and you
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:48.400]  know and this is when the iPhone was a 3.5 inch screen.
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.920]  The original iPhone and people were saying it's too big like
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:54.480]  we you know we're we're coming from a world of flip phones
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.080]  like the and the razor and things the Motorola razor. We
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.880]  need a smaller device like I don't want anything bigger and
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:04.480]  now it's like no one talks about that anymore and when you
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:08.080]  do hold even a even a five and five S. You know next to the
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:12.160]  six plus it's sort of comical how small it seems and I don't
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:14.960]  even know when the last time I held a four was let alone you
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:20.160]  know some of the even the older ones but do you think that they
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:26.000]  go to a world where we have now the six inch screen the is it a
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.360]  five five and a half inch screen and then is it a four
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:33.120]  inch screen or do they do some other like variation on that,
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:36.320]  but is the three skews it seems to me like three skews is
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:39.120]  pretty good because you're you can offer different things at
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:42.320]  each for what people want. Some people want us might want a
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:45.040]  smaller phone. The problem of course is with developers. It's
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:49.120]  a pain in the **** to have to you know supports all of these
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:52.320]  different screen sizes still and so Apple traditionally as
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:56.160]  you know is has been pretty good about retiring older sort
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:59.520]  of technology and making it so that you don't have to support
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:02.720]  that rather you know they they push forward. But what do you
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:05.520]  think that they would do there? I don't know it's it's
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:11.600]  interesting to me. I whether they say 4.7 like one way they
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:15.600]  could go would be to say 4.7 is the new small iPhone size and
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:21.680]  now the $99 mid tier $99 with contract mid tier phone is also
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:25.920]  4.7 inches. They could do that and then that to me would be a
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:30.560]  strong signal that the four inch size. You know, I'm sure
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:33.520]  that they would still have something at the you know free
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.400]  with contract level that still has a four inch screen at the
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:40.960]  end of you know next year, but that it's on the way out. But
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:43.760]  on the other hand, I could see them going though where they
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:46.720]  still say you can still get a four inch phone. You know we've
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:51.680]  got the you know small medium and large screen sizes and you
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:57.040]  know four inch is our mid tier size and it would you know have
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:02.720]  the same you know the the A8 from the iPhone six the camera
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:08.160]  from the iPhone six. But in a four inch form factor, but
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:10.960]  would that form factor be plastic like the five C or would
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:15.120]  it be metal like the five S? I don't know. Yeah and I guess
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:18.080]  the you know the other the other thing to bring up is that
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.960]  I think now are we at the point now where everything has the
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:22.960]  lightning connector. We are right. Yeah. We are with the
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:26.640]  iPhones. Yeah. That's but that's we're not at the place
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:29.200]  where everything has touch ID and I assume that Apple wants
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:33.200]  to get there for Apple Pay especially and then just
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.760]  overall to simplify and make it easier for developers who are
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:38.560]  trying to support touch ID and and you know there's the
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:41.760]  fallback of course of just using passwords, but I would
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:44.000]  assume that they want to get everyone on touch ID. So even
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.360]  the low end ones do you think you agree with that? Well, I
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:50.560]  don't know cuz that's the so the weird thing. It's like I
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:53.440]  said like I think like this year right now until the end of
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:57.440]  the year. The five C is exactly what Apple wanted. They've got
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:00.560]  this you know a nice phone. Everybody likes it. It's easily
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:06.000]  advertised. It's colorful. But because they didn't rev it last
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.560]  year, my assumption is at the end of this year, the five C as
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:13.840]  we know it goes away. That just you know falls off the bottom
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:20.160]  of the product list and it's gone and it's replaced by what
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:22.800]  if they just keep moving things down the line, it would be
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:26.800]  replaced by the five S which does have touch ID but doesn't
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:31.120]  do retail Apple pay like it only does Apple pay like in
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:35.520]  apps, which it doesn't seem to have taken off yet right cuz it
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:39.520]  doesn't have an FC right right and it also if they do that it
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:42.480]  goes against my thinking that they want the bottom of the
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:48.000]  line phone to not have that premium metal. The industrial
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.440]  design like so I don't know like do they come out with a new
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:57.360]  plastic model that debuts at that free tier. Well, it seems
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:02.720]  like an awful lot of new SKUs right. Yes. Yes. Because I also
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:06.000]  feel like part of it's just part of the reason that they
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.680]  can make all these new iPhones is that they're only making one
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:12.400]  one or two new phones a year and the other ones are these
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:15.120]  things you know like the five S that they already know how to
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:18.000]  make and it just you know just keep making them like you did
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.280]  last year. You know the other thing that throws a wrench into
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:24.080]  it is what they did this year and and this is another
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:29.600]  discussion. You know to the iPad mini where they didn't
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:32.240]  update the internals at all, but they gave it touch ID and
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:35.840]  like why why even bother to do that? You know when they're
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:38.160]  when that was the only sort of upgrade that they did and now
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.800]  there's the whole debate. You know did the is the iPhone six
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:44.960]  plus eating into iPad mini sales specifically and what do
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.760]  they do with the future of that line and is there a future of
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:52.240]  that line? Yeah. It's a good question. I you know so maybe I
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:54.560]  don't know like could they come out with like the equivalent of
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:59.520]  a five C, but just add touch ID. Yep. Potentially that's that
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:02.080]  would be that would be something that I might guess
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:05.040]  would be something that they do because I do agree that they
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:07.200]  want to keep. Obviously they want to have differentiating
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:11.520]  factors for the premium, but I do think that their strategy is
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:15.040]  is pretty strong right now around Apple pay and I would
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.280]  imagine that they want like we talked about earlier. They want
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:21.200]  that to be the a moat a new moat that sort of creates a
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:24.320]  reason why you're in the Apple ecosystem, regardless of which
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:27.920]  device you have and so my guess would be yes, they have
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:33.760]  something like an iPhone six C that has a touch ID and NFC.
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:36.480]  They add both of those to it and then yeah, but maybe like
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:40.640]  old and you know a seriously older A series chip like an A6
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.720]  right or something like that right and that's how they
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:45.600]  differentiate. It's not nearly as fast as sort of the high end
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:49.040]  it's maybe plastic and so plastic not as fast. The camera
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:53.200]  is not quite as nice, but it does still have Apple pay and
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:57.760]  touch ID. Yeah, at the very least, I can't imagine that
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:00.080]  they'll ever at any price point. I can't imagine that
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:03.840]  they'll ever come out with any new iPhones that don't do NFC
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:07.600]  and Apple pay. Yeah, I agree, but it's a question. The big
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:10.880]  question is how you know if they keep the five S around
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:16.000]  though and move it down the the product here right. You know
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.640]  that's another year then know that they have a phone that
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:23.840]  doesn't have Apple pay and NFC. Yeah and yeah, I mean that's a
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:28.640]  that's a interesting dilemma for them to have though they've
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:30.240]  they've always dealt with that fine in the past sort of
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:32.800]  keeping those products around longer than anyone else thinks
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:35.120]  that they should and and obviously they they they have
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:37.760]  the data to back that up that they should do that. Yeah,
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:41.920]  totally alright. I wanna tell you about a new sponsor here on
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:48.720]  the show and that sponsor is Oscar. Oscar is a new health
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:51.440]  insurance company. Now. This is US centric and in fact right
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:59.840]  now, it's limited to New York and New Jersey, but they are a
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:04.320]  new insurance company focused on consumers who are able to
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:07.680]  buy their own health insurance through the new affordable
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:13.440]  Care Act AKA Obamacare. The insurance marketplaces that are
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:19.120]  that are new here in the US. So in most cases, you know
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:22.240]  existing health insurance companies are terrible and
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:27.360]  they're particularly poor for people like me who are self
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:30.720]  employed and don't get insurance through any sort of
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:34.720]  group or a job or a business or something like that buying
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:37.680]  insurance as health insurance in the US as an individual or
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:42.320]  as a family. It's just an enormous hassle and a bad deal
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:46.720]  and you get bad service. Oscar is designed to change all of
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:50.000]  that. They already did first year last year. They started in
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.080]  New York and had a great year. This is their second year of
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:57.840]  signing up new customers. Here's where they're available
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:59.600]  because it doesn't matter if you don't live in one of these
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:02.880]  counties. It's not gonna work if you're in New York. The
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:05.920]  Oscar is available in Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx,
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:09.520]  Queens, Staten Island, Rockland, Westchester, Nassau,
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:15.120]  and Suffolk Countings. In New Jersey, they're available in
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:19.680]  Passaic, Morris, Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Union, Middlesex,
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:26.000]  Monmouth, and Ocean counties. They have all sorts of great
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.560]  stuff. Oscar is truly a health insurance company for the
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:34.400]  modern age and for the individuals. They have an app
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:38.160]  and a website where you can do everything from keep your
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:42.880]  medical records, track your medical history, find a doctor,
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:46.720]  talk to one of the doctors that's in the Oscar plan. They
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:50.560]  have a great network of providers and hospitals in the
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:55.280]  New York and North Jersey metro areas. Lots and lots of
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:59.840]  doctors. And and they really just go out of the way to make
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:03.760]  everything easy and to make your benefits what you get
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:08.560]  through your insurance. Both generous and very very clear.
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:10.880]  It's a new kind of health insurance company. So, instead
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:15.280]  of obfuscating your benefits, they spell a lot out in very
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:18.720]  clean language. They have a feature called Doctor on Call.
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:21.360]  You can have a use the app, use their website, and have a board
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:32.960]  certified doctor call you for free 24 seven. Plans include
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:38.480]  benefits like free checkups, free generic drugs, free
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:41.840]  primary care doctor visits, and more. They cover you from head
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:45.520]  to toe with simple benefits that anyone can understand. Now,
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:47.760]  here's the thing. There's some urgency involved here due to
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:52.400]  the way the Affordable Care Act works. You need to sign up by
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:58.320]  February 15th, 2015 for insurance starting March 1st.
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:01.920]  So, by February 15th. So, if you're in the market for health
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:05.200]  insurance, if you're eligible for the Affordable Care Act and
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:08.080]  you pay for your own health insurance and you live in one
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:12.880]  of those counties in New York and New Jersey, I really
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:15.840]  encourage you to call Oscar or check out their website and
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:18.240]  find out more because it's a great deal. Now, I can't get it
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:23.360]  because I live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but a friend of
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:27.200]  the show, editor of the show, Dave Whiskus, lives in New York
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:30.320]  and he's switched his health insurance to Oscar and says that
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:35.440]  it's great. So, here's where you go to find out more. Their
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:41.760]  website is HiOscar.com. HiOscar.com. Like, hello,
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:46.640]  Oscar. HiOscar.com slash the talk show. Then, they'll know
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:50.880]  you came here from from this podcast. HiOscar.com slash the

[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:08.880]  the market for health insurance in New York and New Jersey, go
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:12.720]  check him out. It really seems like a great, great deal. Alright,
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:19.520]  anything else on your mind? No, I mean, I'm still so I was
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:26.080]  back in San Francisco a couple weeks ago for a while and you
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:28.320]  know, I've been sort of going back and forth about Apple
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:32.000]  Watch. So, unlike you, I wasn't at the event, the unveiling and
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.040]  so I didn't get a chance to sort of see it and sort of get
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:37.440]  a better sense of what it was. I watched the, you know, the
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:40.240]  keynote sort of it's great that they stream it live and so I
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:42.400]  could watch it here despite their technical hiccups which
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:47.200]  I'm sure you heard about. You know, that was bad. Yeah, it's
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:50.640]  really bad but they fixed it a little bit for the for the
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:55.040]  later one but so I wasn't sure really what to make of Apple
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:58.000]  Watch and I and I'm still sort of trying to get there but I
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.960]  had a number of interesting discussions with people more
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:06.640]  in the know while I was back and sort of thinking through
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:09.680]  things of where this is going to go and I'm starting to get a
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:13.200]  lot more bullish on Apple Watch than I was to begin with. Not
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:16.960]  to say that I was bearish on it but I was wondering, I was
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:18.960]  sort of wondering a lot of what we talked about sort of, you
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:22.400]  know, how many people are going to pay a premium for for a gold
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:25.120]  one, how many people are going to buy the the edition one,
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.600]  how many people are going to buy, you know, the the cheaper
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:30.400]  sport one and and what does it mean and and then when they
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:33.200]  release the SDK and just like we were talking about earlier,
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:36.880]  it sort of seemed like they were more widget-like apps
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:39.600]  rather than true apps and it seemed like, you know, Apple was
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:42.560]  already telepathing into the future where they're going to
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:45.040]  make them more robust apps. So they're almost like saying
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:48.160]  like, yeah, we're going to put this out there but V2 of this
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.560]  is going to be real is when things get really interesting
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:54.000]  and so, you know, it's it's sort of the the old problem
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.960]  that Apple has had amongst many people who believe, you know,
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:59.120]  like don't buy the first version of something like they
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:03.280]  always make it better the second version. But I am
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:07.920]  definitely getting more bullish on it now after having sort of
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:11.040]  had a few chats and and learned a lot more about about what
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:14.720]  it's actually doing. Where where's your mind at with it? I
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:18.400]  I've never been either bullish or bearish. I even having been
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:21.120]  at the event and even having, you know, I didn't get to use
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:23.680]  it because they were all running the demo software but I
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:29.200]  did get to at least try one on. I've always been ambivalent
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:32.480]  like tell me more like I need to know more about this before
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:37.600]  I can even decide either way. To me, the big I still feel that
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:40.480]  way. That's why I ultimately I still feel like they've they're
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:43.760]  probably going to have another event before it comes out and
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:46.240]  you know, if the other rumors are right and they're going to
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:49.760]  do like a bigger iPad that would make sense to do it all in
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:53.120]  one event and so there's a new thing which is a bigger, you
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:57.680]  know, pro sized 11 inch or 12 inch iPad. So here's a new
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:02.640]  thing and here is more on this thing we announced in September
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:06.160]  the Apple Watch which is now imminent and let us show you
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:10.400]  more. That to me feels like they don't even need to do
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:15.200]  anymore. That's a perfect Apple event. A new iPad at a new size
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:17.840]  you know and if the thing about the stylus is right, there's
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:20.640]  all sorts of demos they can do there. You know, bring up
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:23.920]  somebody some third party with you know, show some kind of
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:27.040]  Wacom style professional artwork being drawn on the
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:31.600]  thing and then you know, show me more about the Apple Watch.
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:35.440]  The thing that gets me and it is the confidence that Apple
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:38.640]  seems to have about the watch. It's not what they've told us
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:42.960]  and what you can read at apple.com slash watch. It's the
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:46.640]  confidence that Tim Cook has and everybody else who's spoken
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:50.400]  about it publicly. They're so confident about it that to me,
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:54.000]  it's it it it seems like it would be reckless to bet
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.040]  against it because they're just not they're not the type of
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:01.600]  people who breathlessly promote everything and anything that
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:06.400]  they do. I agree with you definitely. I think that that
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:09.200]  is something that that makes it so you can't obviously you
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.280]  can't write it off. Well, you could never write it off being
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:15.840]  from Apple these days, but their confidence is is pretty
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:18.720]  fascinating. The the way that they're positioning it.
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:21.520]  They're obviously still doing this like world tour of going
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:23.600]  around and talking to all the the various people in the
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:26.000]  fashion industry hiring the various people in the fashion
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.360]  industry to to bring them in to make sure that they're ready to
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:34.080]  go for for this does it all adds to sort of the the feeling
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:38.880]  I'm getting but I also just am starting to get a better sense
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:45.680]  of what I think that they think they can do with it. I do think
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:51.200]  that the early days will be maybe a little bit underwhelming
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:54.400]  at first because they're only going to work with you know a
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:58.400]  handful of of people as they always do behind the scenes to
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:01.440]  get third party apps sort of ready to go for when this thing
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:03.520]  launches and they're going to be obvious things and it'll be
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:07.680]  largely predicated around push notifications. I would assume
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:09.760]  but I do I am starting to believe more that there's
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:12.400]  there's different types of things that third party
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:15.360]  developers will be able to accomplish and maybe it takes
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:18.240]  to the second SDK. The more robust thing for it to really
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:22.240]  get there, but you know I'm I'm reminded back to the when the
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:26.160]  iPhone first came out and you know we had sort of developers
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:28.400]  making the web apps because they didn't have access to
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:31.200]  actually making native apps at the time only Apple did. So
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:33.920]  it's not exactly what's going on here, but we are getting a
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:37.200]  little bit of what feels like a muted SDK for third party
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:41.440]  developers right now. Yeah. I think it's somewhat analogous.
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:45.760]  I think it's a little bit better than the web apps of 2007,
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:51.920]  but it's close. It's it's not a bad analogy. I agree and so now
[01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:55.440]  I'm trying to think through you know when Apple did release
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:58.800]  the the second sort of SDK for the iPhone that that allowed
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:03.440]  for for native app development. It was insanely exciting to
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:05.760]  everyone, but no one really knew what would happen. We knew
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:08.320]  games would come and and there would be sort of silly little
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:11.040]  apps to begin with which there were there were you know many
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:13.680]  and then it wasn't clear if there would ever be like big
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:16.480]  businesses right real businesses built on top of that
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:19.200]  and look at it now. I mean how many how many billion dollar
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:22.400]  businesses have been built on top of the iPhone alone, but
[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:25.200]  you know and Android and stuff, but the iPhone is what kicked
[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:27.760]  it off. It's like Instagram and all these other things that are
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:32.800]  that were you know iOS only at the time and is there a way
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:34.960]  this is what I'm trying to think through. Is there a way
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:38.720]  for the watch to do something similar? Your instinct is that
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:41.680]  sounds ridiculous right like that that there's that there's
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:45.280]  this watch the small little device that's that's that just
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:49.120]  seems like more of a novelty or is it going to actually be
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:52.000]  something that big businesses can be built on and I think
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.040]  that there's two camps. There's there's people who believe that
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:57.600]  eventually we will get to that place and there can be sort of
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:00.880]  new new interactive paradigms with like sort of the the
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:03.520]  tactic feedback stuff and there will be new types of messaging
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:06.640]  apps that we haven't thought of yet, but then there's the other
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:09.600]  group that I think is more along the lines of look the
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:13.680]  Apple Watch. Here's what it is. It's just another moat for the
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:16.960]  iPhone. It's a way you can't use it right now without the
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:21.440]  iPhone. It's a paired device with that and so it makes the
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:24.880]  iPhone more attractive to iPhone owners and it makes it
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:27.760]  gives people maybe another reason to buy an iPhone rather
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:32.000]  than choosing an Android device or some other similar device.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.880]  Yeah. I don't know. I feel like both of those scenarios are
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:40.640]  possible. I do feel like ultimately it's you know just
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:43.360]  the march of technology is that eventually it will be
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:46.000]  independent like it won't need you know it'll have its own
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:51.040]  internet access without an iPhone right just to me
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:54.160]  exactly the way that the iPhone used to need a Mac or PC
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:58.560]  running iTunes to sync. I mean it's still it seems crazy like
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:01.280]  there was the only way to get contacts on your iPhone was to
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:06.160]  sync it with your computer using a cable and I kind of feel
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:10.400]  like the watch needing a phone it within Bluetooth range to
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:14.720]  get internet is the same thing like you know 345 years from
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:17.520]  now. We're going to laugh at the fact that you couldn't get
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:20.560]  text messages on your phone unless you were within you know
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:23.120]  twenty feet of your or on your watch unless you were within
[01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:27.360]  twenty feet of your phone. But in the meantime, I do feel like
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:30.880]  that's the way that you bootstrap it is that it's again
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:32.880]  like you said like a moat around the iPhone. I think
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:36.240]  that's how it debuts and then all of a sudden you realize
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:39.760]  it's you know 234 years from now. It's its own thing. That's
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:42.720]  right. I agree with that and I think I think they're going
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:45.600]  about it the right way with everything that they've sort of
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:48.480]  shown so far. You know having used a lot of these other sort
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:51.600]  of wearable devices. They're all they all range from either
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:54.400]  very bad to sort of just mediocre. There's no great one
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:57.760]  right now and I think a lot of it is that a lot of a lot of
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:01.200]  these companies have just basically taken the phone
[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:04.480]  paradigm that the smartphone the touch screen paradigm and
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:08.720]  strapped it on the wrist and Apple with this crown sort of
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:11.360]  interaction. They're trying to actually think about what they
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:14.080]  should do. I mean you're putting your hate when you're
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:16.640]  touching the screen all the time. You're completely
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:19.280]  covering the screen like why would you do that? You know so
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:22.000]  like the crown where you can zoom in and out that that's
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.360]  like sort of is an obvious thing in hindsight that I think
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:28.800]  is is is going to be sort of a killer feature that everyone
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:32.160]  ends up copying. Of course, but it's it's things like that that
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:35.920]  make me more excited about you know the prospects for it,
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:38.480]  though I agree with sort of everything we're saying, which
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:42.080]  is that the first iteration it will take a while to to prove
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:47.040]  these things out. Yeah. I think that the crown in particular is
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:49.600]  one of the reasons like why did they announce it when they
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:53.680]  announced it? Well, part of it is like I wrote I wrote this
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:58.560]  week that part of it. I think is that they wanted to announce
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:01.200]  it before it went into production because once it went
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:03.760]  into production, it was inevitably going to leak and in
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:07.600]  fact it did leak. There was like one day before they
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:10.160]  announced it. There actually were like blueprints that
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:13.280]  leaked that that were you know in hindsight were pretty much
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:17.040]  spot on or exactly spot on. They didn't get a lot of
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:20.240]  publicity because they weren't real pictures, but if it had
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:22.640]  happened even a week earlier, somebody you know could have
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:27.040]  done like a 3D rendering and and and spoiled it. I think
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:30.080]  they really wanted to be the ones to unveil it and they're
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:36.000]  glad they did. Six months is about the outer limit. I think
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.200]  for when Apple could do it, I think and you know, I think
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:43.200]  it's also possible that in in like an ideal world, if
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:45.360]  everything had gone according to plan, maybe it wouldn't be
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:48.240]  shipping in April. Maybe it would have been shipping like
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:53.600]  in February and it's you know just you know enough bugs
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:56.880]  still remain. Enough kinks still remain in the software
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:58.960]  that they need the extra two months before they feel
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:02.800]  comfortable shipping. But well, I it also I definitely heard
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:05.920]  that they did want to do this in the fall and it just oh
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:09.840]  originally yeah definitely yeah like and in hindsight with
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:13.040]  some of Tim Cook's remarks like it all things D or whatever
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.520]  that's right you know I think the year before that they you
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:18.320]  know they have a they have products to release all throughout
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:21.760]  2014. Yeah, I think like two years ago they were thinking
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:25.200]  like a holiday release for 2014. So I think it's I think
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:27.200]  that's definitely the case. I've heard the same thing too
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:31.840]  like internally that it's you know yeah not that they're
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:34.240]  shocked. I don't think it's like a disaster. I just think
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:38.400]  it's yeah it just it just was not the best case scenario.
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:41.920]  Yeah, there's soft and it's I think it's largely software
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:45.360]  rather than the hardware that's going on. It's a software
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:48.480]  it's hard to nail this this new sort of paradigm that they're
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:51.760]  trying to do. Yeah, I think that the hardware that they
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:53.920]  and who knows I mean because you know it's not like they
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:57.120]  were letting us crack open the demo units back in September,
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:00.320]  but I'm pretty sure that the hardware they showed us at the
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:03.680]  event in September is exactly the hardware they intend to
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:06.960]  show. I think I'm pretty sure that it is yeah yeah and that
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:10.080]  they're like internally like Johnny Ive's team is already
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:15.120]  working on the next revision of the hardware like they've you
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:18.240]  know the hardware is done and defined and you know it's that
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:22.400]  screen and that chip and that metal and you know everything
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:25.040]  down to the bands that that stuff is all done. It's yeah. I
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:29.760]  think it's all software that's still being worked on and of
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:32.800]  course the the component of that is the battery life and
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:35.360]  what do you think about sort of I'm sure you saw the the Mark
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:38.720]  German report about the the breakdown of the battery life
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:42.240]  issue and so it's you know I think it was 2.5 hours of of
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:47.200]  full active usage, which is a little bit you know misleading
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:50.160]  because are you going to be sitting there on your watch for
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:52.240]  two two and a half straight hours using it straight
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:55.920]  through? No, but what do you think is that like in the
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:37:00.160]  ballpark you thought it would get to? Yeah, I think that the
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:02.960]  basic gist is that they need to make it so that if you're an
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:07.040]  act if you use your Apple Watch thoroughly that you can still
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:12.800]  get through a day no problem. I've seen some stuff you know
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:14.800]  the demo units they showed us and all the screenshots they
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:21.760]  show us don't show a battery meter all the time and the the
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:25.680]  simulator in Xcode does so there's some question as to
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:28.240]  whether you know where they've you know what what are the
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:31.920]  actual production ones are going to do? Yeah. How are you
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:34.000]  going to check the battery like it seems as though what
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.640]  they've shown us so far is that you're not supposed to even I'm
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:39.360]  I'm sure there's some way to do it like go into settings and
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:41.360]  there's you know if you really want to check your battery
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:45.600]  there'll be a way. I feel like what they want to do is just
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:49.680]  get it so that it you know if you charge it every night
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:52.640]  you'll be fine and you don't have to worry about it and if
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:55.040]  you forget to charge it one night you're probably going to
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:58.400]  it's probably going to die the next day. And you know one
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:01.520]  thing so as we know with the phones now and iPad and
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:03.920]  everything else like the biggest draw power draw is the
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:07.680]  screen of all these things and I think that it seems like
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:10.720]  they're doing smart things with that the other what the
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:12.880]  other sort of smart watch makers haven't done by the way
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:17.440]  which is when you get sort of notifications coming in rather
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:20.800]  than illuminate the screen right away. They're using their
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:24.560]  haptic thing the haptic engine to be able to alert you to that
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:27.920]  so the screen is going to be on probably less than you think
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:30.720]  it is because we all see these smart watches out there right
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:33.120]  now that light up when whenever you get something and that's
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:35.600]  not going to be the case with this. Yeah I mentioned last
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:38.080]  week with when Ben Thompson was on the show that from what
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:41.600]  I've heard from a couple people again not first hand not
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:44.000]  anybody who has a watch but all second hand from people who've
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.960]  talked to people who are testing the watch is that an
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:50.160]  enormous amount of effort has gone into making it so that
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:52.880]  when you do want to look at the screen, it comes right on like
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:56.560]  the detection of your wrist and you know the the motion
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:00.320]  detection of what angle the watch is at. Hey, I'll bet this
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:03.920]  you know the person is wants to look at me right now and then
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:06.720]  when you move it away, it goes off that they've you know an
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:10.000]  enormous amount of work over the last 3 years has gone into
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.120]  just turning the screen on and off when it wants to be on and
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:17.760]  off. I feel like the stuff is is interesting. It's you know I
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:21.440]  have no reason to doubt that those are the actual numbers. I
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:25.040]  just feel though that it's like it almost doesn't it isn't
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:26.720]  really helpful to thinking about how you're going to use
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:32.640]  the watch. It's it's just sort of there enumerating. That's
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:36.160]  right. I'm 100% in agreement with that. It's sort of it's
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:39.360]  thinking it's it's yes, it's it's sort of the spec sheet.
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:43.200]  It's what it will be like if you were just in a in a vacuum
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:45.360]  if you just said like give me the numbers of what it's going
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:48.080]  to do when it's like this and this, but I think the key is
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:51.600]  that the way that it's been engineered the Apple watch will
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:55.280]  change the way that people at least right now think that
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:58.640]  they're going to use it. It's not going to be all the time
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:01.440]  coming on and it's not going to be you have a hard time. You
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:03.600]  know turning the screen off or you have to hit a button to
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:06.000]  turn the screen on and off and all that kind of stuff and so
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.320]  yeah, I think it will end up lasting a lot longer than
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:11.120]  people are sort of thinking about just reading that that
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:16.080]  that stat line. Yeah. The polar opposite to me would be the the
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:21.360]  now defunct iPod Nano or whatever it was called the one
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:24.880]  that was square and then yeah, there was the I think it was
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:28.080]  the watch fans. Yeah. The tick tock kick card. Yep.
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:30.640]  Started. Yep. I got that right. I bought that. I did too, which
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:34.320]  I think at the time was like the broke the record for like a
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:37.520]  Kickstarter project. It did and it really was well done. It was
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:43.840]  as well done as a turn your iPod Nano into a watch could be
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:51.280]  done. I think um but I got it. I popped my iPod into it and and
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:53.840]  you know 5 minutes later took it off and never use it again
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:56.320]  because the idea of a watch that you had to hit a button to
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:59.440]  read drove me nuts. It would you know cuz you had you know
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:02.000]  there was no motion detection cuz the iPod wasn't meant for
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.880]  that so you you know to see the time or do anything with it.
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:08.880]  You had to use your other hand and hit the button and it's
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:13.200]  that's funny. It was you know and I you know I could see why
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:16.960]  some people liked it but for me as somebody who wears a watch
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:20.880]  and just wants to glance at the time it was maddening and I feel
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:24.080]  like the Apple Watch is the opposite of that and that sort
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:26.480]  of also leads to to one last thing. I know we've been going
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:28.000]  for a while, but I don't know when we'll talk again. So I
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:31.440]  wanna there's uh so with that you know you also had if you
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:32.960]  wanted to listen to music, which is what you do. Of
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:35.920]  course, mainly with an iPod you had to have you know your
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:39.680]  your uh white earbuds plugged into your wrist and then they
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:41.920]  would be going up to your ears right and it's like. Yeah. If
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:45.520]  you're trying to run, you could you know rip the the earbuds
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:48.160]  out of your ears. Uh if you're for some reason, you know
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:51.200]  moving your arms too far or something that leads to a
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:55.200]  question, which I have no idea uh but I and I don't know if
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:57.920]  they're gonna do this anytime soon or if this waits till sort
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:00.640]  of the fall or the next version or something, but like they
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:03.280]  have to be doing something with Bluetooth earbuds right. I
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:06.480]  mean, there's no way that they can they're they're already
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:08.960]  saying that you'll be able to store music and and some
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:11.280]  podcast and they'll it'll have limited storage to be able to
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:13.920]  do that and they want you to be running with it and and you can
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:16.400]  have sort of you know be able to listen to your music and
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:18.640]  they're saying I think they said in the press material or
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:21.280]  whatever you can use. You know your Bluetooth uh you know
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:24.320]  running people have special running Bluetooth headsets that
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:26.720]  they already use and they're decent or whatever, but that's
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:28.240]  not gonna be good enough for Apple. They're gonna wanna do
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:31.360]  their own right and when are they gonna do that? Yeah, it's
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:38.300]  a it's a perfect. Has to happen eventually idea and and again I
[01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:42.220]  think having used the iPod nano with the tick tock watch
[01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:44.940]  strap. I had the exact same thing. I thought well when I
[01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:46.460]  when I sent it for the Kickstarter, I thought I'm
[01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:49.340]  probably not gonna like this as a watch because I'm not gonna
[01:42:49.340 --> 01:42:51.580]  like a watch that I have to hit a button to see, but I might
[01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:55.980]  like it as something to use my iPod when I go running and in
[01:42:55.980 --> 01:42:59.340]  fact I hated it because exactly what you said that having the
[01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:04.060]  cable go to my wrist and my arm is moving while you while you
[01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:09.020]  run. It was maddening. It was it just felt like like I was
[01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:13.020]  like I don't know it felt like the sort of thing that you you
[01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:16.780]  know, like like like when you're on probation and they
[01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:23.180]  put like a right. But I can't help but feel the same thing
[01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:25.660]  with the with the Apple. I mean the watch clearly doesn't even
[01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:30.460]  have a headphone jack, so it's I you know it's going to and it
[01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:34.700]  does do Bluetooth audio. So if the watch does Bluetooth audio
[01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:38.380]  and the future is to not have a cable between your headphones
[01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:43.660]  and your device period, Apple has to do Bluetooth. My question
[01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:46.860]  though is if Apple goes and does Bluetooth headphones of
[01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:51.980]  their own, are they going to be included with devices or yeah
[01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:56.700]  and and and or if they're not will they do them themselves or
[01:43:56.700 --> 01:44:00.460]  will it be like a beats thing? Well, so remember how they used
[01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:02.860]  to have I think they still probably sell them. They they
[01:44:02.860 --> 01:44:06.780]  had those more high end version of any ear earbuds cuz I bought
[01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:09.020]  them at one point. They were like $100 or something. Yeah, I
[01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:11.260]  remember that right for the other ones and they were pretty
[01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:13.740]  good. They were okay. They had like three different sort of
[01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:17.500]  sizes that that you got the the earbud gel things that you
[01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:19.420]  could sort of stick in your ears depending on how big your
[01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:22.460]  ears are and they were okay. They were definitely better
[01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:26.220]  than the old version of the earbuds that came with all the
[01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:29.820]  iPods and everything. The I don't think they're better than
[01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:33.580]  the new version of the earbuds. At least I don't use those
[01:44:33.580 --> 01:44:35.740]  higher end versions. I'm not even sure if they sell them. I
[01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:38.220]  think that they still do but I would imagine that's how they
[01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:40.780]  do it at first. At least that they sell them as like cuz
[01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:43.340]  they'll probably be expensive to make more expensive than the
[01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:47.580]  current iteration. So maybe they sell them for those $100
[01:44:47.580 --> 01:44:50.860]  and then eventually they sort of move towards that because
[01:44:50.860 --> 01:44:53.180]  that is something I always think about. You know like what
[01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:56.380]  else can they do to improve the iPhones right now and the
[01:44:56.380 --> 01:44:59.660]  biggest pain point now is honestly untangling the damn
[01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:02.460]  earbuds when they're in my pocket. I know that they're
[01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:04.620]  like you know everyone. I complained about this from time
[01:45:04.620 --> 01:45:07.180]  time on Twitter and everyone comes at me with like you
[01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:09.820]  should get these ties or you know this thing and they have
[01:45:09.820 --> 01:45:11.980]  all these like third-party products to like make it better
[01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:14.780]  but like really I just want I don't wanna carry around more
[01:45:14.780 --> 01:45:18.220]  stuff. I just wanna have my ear ear buds and I wanna have the
[01:45:18.220 --> 01:45:22.300]  phone in my pocket and I want the earbuds not to somehow
[01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:26.300]  defy the laws of physics and get so tangled up that it seems
[01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:29.180]  like you have to cut them almost to in order to untangle
[01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:31.580]  them and so it's another thing that really strikes me in the
[01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:36.300]  winter too because it's so much more of a pain in the ass when
[01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:40.940]  you're wearing a coat and yeah and you've got these these
[01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:44.460]  things dangling down right and it's like when do you it
[01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:46.780]  there's no good way to do it like if you you know wanna
[01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:49.500]  listen to podcasts like I you know I walk almost everywhere
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:51.340]  in the city and I run errands and that's when I listen to
[01:45:51.340 --> 01:45:54.140]  podcasts and it's great but when it's winter and I have to
[01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:57.020]  wear a coat it's like what do I do do I put it in my pocket
[01:45:57.020 --> 01:45:59.660]  and start listening to podcasts and put the coat over the
[01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:03.340]  headphones and then it like it pulls but if you put the coat
[01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:07.260]  on first and string it over the coat it there's just no good
[01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:09.820]  way with the cable like as opposed to when you're not
[01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:12.060]  wearing a coat you can just put your phone in the pocket and
[01:46:12.060 --> 01:46:14.140]  it's not too much of a hindrance to have the headphone
[01:46:14.140 --> 01:46:17.740]  cable going from your jeans pocket to your ears put a
[01:46:17.740 --> 01:46:20.220]  winter coat on and it it there's no good way. It's hard
[01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:22.940]  to do have you have you tried one of the Bluetooth ones
[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:25.500]  before so it's like funny. You know I going back into the the
[01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:27.900]  late 90s or whatever when they first came out, obviously they
[01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:33.580]  sort of got this douchey you know sort of aura around them,
[01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:37.740]  but I use the I use the jawbone era. I think it's called yeah
[01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:41.660]  the era quite often now the problem is that it's only
[01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:44.060]  obviously one ear so it's not great for music. You can do it
[01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:48.300]  for music, but for podcasts and stuff. It's pretty good. It's
[01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:51.580]  the only other downside is with one ear. It's you have to turn
[01:46:51.580 --> 01:46:54.540]  it up quite high sometimes like if you're in a in a louder
[01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:57.980]  environment to be able to hear and I never use it for calling
[01:46:57.980 --> 01:46:59.900]  or anything, but I don't honestly don't make that many
[01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:02.540]  calls so I don't use the speaker part, but I use it a
[01:47:02.540 --> 01:47:06.780]  lot as a just to listen to things. It's a little bit wonky
[01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:09.180]  the job on software isn't great and so it can take a little
[01:47:09.180 --> 01:47:13.260]  while to pair and sometimes it drops and it's not great audio
[01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:15.740]  quality. I would say, but it's good for podcast. Definitely.
[01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:18.380]  Yeah. I've I would probably enjoy that if I had one, but
[01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:22.140]  I've never tried it. Yeah. I you know I haven't tried any of
[01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:24.540]  the others, but the job on one is is pretty solid. I kind of
[01:47:24.540 --> 01:47:26.940]  wonder what the form factor would be for like an Apple
[01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:31.660]  Bluetooth headset like you know would would would they be
[01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:35.020]  connected somehow and if so, what would it be like a thing
[01:47:35.020 --> 01:47:38.380]  that goes around the back of your head? Yeah. That's an
[01:47:38.380 --> 01:47:40.700]  interesting point there. I've seen both. I've seen ones that
[01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:42.620]  are like that where they have a thing that goes around the
[01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:45.260]  back of your head. I think I've also seen one where they still
[01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:47.660]  did something like dangling, but it's not connected. You
[01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:50.220]  know right because somewhere there's gotta be a battery so
[01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:54.460]  it can't be it can't just be the ear pieces. You know like
[01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:57.260]  ideally it would just be two ear pieces that you put in
[01:47:57.260 --> 01:48:00.780]  independently, but then you need two batteries and they'd
[01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:03.820]  be one of the reasons why I think the the jawbone one is
[01:48:03.820 --> 01:48:06.060]  sort of bigger than it even needs to be is just cuz the
[01:48:06.060 --> 01:48:08.620]  battery obviously and the battery is not great by the way
[01:48:08.620 --> 01:48:11.980]  either that thing lasts for it says 4 hours of talk time. I
[01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:14.860]  think it's it's usually like two and a half hours max. It
[01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:18.220]  will last. Yeah. I feel like that's it's gotta happen, but I
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:21.100]  don't have I have no idea how it's gonna happen. I feel like
[01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:23.660]  Bluetooth has you know the headphone cables have gotta go
[01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:26.220]  the way to the dodo and the other thing too. That's gotta
[01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:30.060]  be a motivation for Apple is just staring at my iPhone six
[01:48:30.060 --> 01:48:32.620]  right now. I can't help but look at it and think that the
[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:37.260]  headphone jack has now a gating factor on making it. Yes,
[01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:41.180]  making it. That's the biggest part it. Yeah. You know the
[01:48:41.180 --> 01:48:45.020]  the lightning adapter is so much thinner than the headphone
[01:48:45.020 --> 01:48:49.420]  jack and I and whatever whatever the whatever the
[01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:53.020]  thickest port is on your device is gonna be the next one Apple
[01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:56.620]  gets rid of and right now. It's the headphone jack well and
[01:48:56.620 --> 01:48:59.420]  obviously they're starting. I think pretty soon. I think they
[01:48:59.420 --> 01:49:01.580]  have a few already, but they there was some story that
[01:49:01.580 --> 01:49:03.900]  they're gonna start shipping the lightning ones right so
[01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:06.220]  you'll be able to do audio through the lightning port and
[01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:09.580]  so I'd imagine that's how they do it. Maybe even starting next
[01:49:09.580 --> 01:49:11.740]  year or something that they they just sort of get rid of
[01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:14.940]  the the headphone jack and and my god. I can't wait for people
[01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:17.260]  to complain about that. That will be you know that's gonna
[01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:19.980]  be the next getting rid of the optical drive and you know
[01:49:19.980 --> 01:49:22.540]  killing the mouse and all these types of things like when they
[01:49:22.540 --> 01:49:26.860]  kill that audio that headphone jack. It's gonna be it's gonna
[01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:29.900]  be a **** storm and people are gonna say it's because they own
[01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:33.100]  beats and beats. That's right. That's right. Yeah. It's all
[01:49:33.100 --> 01:49:37.100]  we'll have an antitrust investigation. You know like
[01:49:37.100 --> 01:49:40.780]  it's all it's all a scheme to get you to buy beats headphones
[01:49:40.780 --> 01:49:44.620]  right, but I would assume that that's what they're gonna do.
[01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:47.340]  It seems like only natural because you can actually drop
[01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:51.100]  it. You can draw power from that too, which is pretty
[01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:54.460]  interesting right so you could have a pair of headphones that
[01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:57.580]  are connected still, but you know like the noise cancelling
[01:49:57.580 --> 01:50:00.620]  ones where right now you need like AAA batteries, but I'd
[01:50:00.620 --> 01:50:03.820]  like the Bose ones that that that cancel out the noise, but
[01:50:03.820 --> 01:50:06.060]  they need AAA batteries to put in them and if you could just
[01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:08.380]  draw the power from the phone, that's interesting, but that
[01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:11.900]  doesn't alleviate the that actually probably exacerbates
[01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:15.340]  the the cord issue still. Yeah, probably yeah. Well, I'd have
[01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:20.300]  to. Yeah and then the other thing I was thinking like
[01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:22.220]  there's noise cancelling whenever I think of noise
[01:50:22.220 --> 01:50:25.740]  cancelling when I used I used to have a pair of Bose noise
[01:50:25.740 --> 01:50:28.460]  cancelling and I do I kinda miss them whenever I'm on a
[01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:31.260]  plane because they really do work and I always think of them
[01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:34.780]  as something you wear on a plane, but they're just so
[01:50:34.780 --> 01:50:38.300]  bulky. Yeah, exactly. It's it's such a huge. They're so
[01:50:38.300 --> 01:50:43.340]  big compared to earbuds and if they drew power, that's the
[01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:45.260]  other thing too is that you know you don't wanna get off
[01:50:45.260 --> 01:50:47.100]  the plane and have your phone be dead because you were
[01:50:47.100 --> 01:50:50.300]  powering your head your headphones and if you've there's
[01:50:50.300 --> 01:50:52.940]  only one lightning adapter. So even if you're on a plane,
[01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:55.580]  depending on your airline, if you have a you're lucky enough
[01:50:55.580 --> 01:50:59.340]  to be on a plane where you can have a power port right now,
[01:50:59.340 --> 01:51:01.420]  you're gonna you can't charge it while you're while you're
[01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:04.860]  using it for lightning to do the headphones. Yeah. I feel
[01:51:04.860 --> 01:51:08.140]  like Bluetooth is the way to go. Yeah. The only way that
[01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:11.420]  that would their trade off would be good there is if is if
[01:51:11.420 --> 01:51:13.980]  by drawing power from the phone, you could significantly
[01:51:13.980 --> 01:51:17.180]  reduce the bulk of the noise cancelling so they didn't need
[01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:20.380]  the battery. Obviously, I don't know. I don't know what's
[01:51:20.380 --> 01:51:22.780]  involved in sort of the noise cancelling technology, but I
[01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:25.660]  cannot help but think that the headphone jack is going the way
[01:51:25.660 --> 01:51:28.860]  of the dodo. I mean, I really I honestly don't know how much
[01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:31.100]  thinner they could make the device and still have it. I
[01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:34.780]  mean a little bit just looking at it, but it's really and then
[01:51:34.780 --> 01:51:37.580]  could they could they do stereo speakers then do you think on
[01:51:37.580 --> 01:51:40.460]  the you know at the bottom where they only have the one
[01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:43.580]  sort of side is is the speaker could they do both would they
[01:51:43.580 --> 01:51:47.580]  do both does that matter? I don't know. I feel like I've
[01:51:47.580 --> 01:51:50.140]  never gotten a definitive answer on it, but when I've
[01:51:50.140 --> 01:51:52.380]  brought it up with people at Apple, they've always said that
[01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:56.220]  it's a gimmick because it's too close. It doesn't make it. It
[01:51:56.220 --> 01:51:59.180]  actually doesn't. Yeah, that's right. I've heard the same
[01:51:59.180 --> 01:52:02.300]  thing. It's sort of it wouldn't matter or you're exactly right.
[01:52:02.300 --> 01:52:04.780]  I think it might matter a little bit if and I've seen some
[01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:07.500]  phone you know like with android you can find a phone
[01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:10.300]  that does anything. You know there's some obscure Sony one
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:13.500]  that has like speaker on the top and the bottom so that when
[01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:17.580]  you hold the phone in horizontal mode like you would
[01:52:17.580 --> 01:52:20.220]  when you're watching a video, there's a little bit more
[01:52:20.220 --> 01:52:22.540]  separation and I could see it would make a difference, but
[01:52:22.540 --> 01:52:25.500]  for the most part, you know if you have stereo speakers on the
[01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:29.260]  bottom on just on one side of the phone, it's pointless. Yeah
[01:52:29.260 --> 01:52:32.140]  and in fact when you're watching video sideways, it's
[01:52:32.140 --> 01:52:34.700]  counterproductive right because you know what's the point of
[01:52:34.700 --> 01:52:36.940]  having left and right when they're both on the right
[01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:39.580]  because that's how you're holding the phone like it's
[01:52:39.580 --> 01:52:41.980]  it's you know. So that's what I've heard is that it's just a
[01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:44.700]  stupid marketing checkpoint that they're not going to go
[01:52:44.700 --> 01:52:48.700]  for. That was one of the rumored features, though of the
[01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:51.500]  iPad Pro right that it might have stereo like because it
[01:52:51.500 --> 01:52:54.060]  would have speakers on both sides. Who knows if that's it.
[01:52:54.060 --> 01:52:56.140]  It could end up being legitimate at all, but I think
[01:52:56.140 --> 01:52:58.860]  that was at one point like I still think though it only makes
[01:52:58.860 --> 01:53:01.580]  sense if they were at the top and bottom not left and right
[01:53:01.580 --> 01:53:05.020]  because yeah, that's how you watch video and video or when
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:07.500]  you want it like who cares if your alert sounds come in
[01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:12.140]  stereo. That's right or what they could do if they do
[01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:16.540]  actually do some sort of keyboard device with the iPad
[01:53:16.540 --> 01:53:19.340]  Pro. Maybe they could do it just like they do with Macbooks
[01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:21.340]  now where they have the speaker sort of built under the
[01:53:21.340 --> 01:53:23.740]  keyboard. Yeah, something like that. I could see I don't know,
[01:53:23.740 --> 01:53:26.460]  but I don't think putting them on the actual sides of the
[01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:32.220]  device makes any sense. Yeah. Alright, I think that about
[01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:35.180]  does it good talking to you. We shouldn't make it so long this
[01:53:35.180 --> 01:53:57.820]  next time.
