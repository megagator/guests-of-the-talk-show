[00:00.000 --> 00:04.520]  So, anyway, did you, have you ever noticed, Ben Thompson joining me this week on the talk,
[00:04.520 --> 00:08.760]  on the talk show. Do you ever notice there's some websites where, like, the username and
[00:08.760 --> 00:11.160]  password don't get autofilled?
[00:11.160 --> 00:15.760]  Yeah, I think usually it's the website's fault, like, mislabel the field or something.
[00:15.760 --> 00:20.760]  Yeah, and it's not like the thing where, like, certain financial sites have, like,
[00:20.760 --> 00:25.400]  an opt-out thing. It's like a site where there's nothing really super confidential
[00:25.400 --> 00:28.080]  about it. It should work, it just doesn't.
[00:28.080 --> 00:32.800]  Yeah. Well, I'm still scarred from the whole, like, they've had autocomplete for just,
[00:32.800 --> 00:37.320]  like, addresses, like, when you're buying something, and I swear those never worked
[00:37.320 --> 00:41.560]  for, like, the first three years, and maybe they work today, but I will never know, because
[00:41.560 --> 00:42.800]  I refuse to use them.
[00:42.800 --> 00:44.680]  Yeah. Well, you don't use the auto?
[00:44.680 --> 00:48.400]  I'm still tabbing through every field, which then brings me to the even worse annoyance
[00:48.400 --> 00:52.040]  when they have the fields in the wrong order, and your tab suddenly lands you on the bottom
[00:52.040 --> 00:53.360]  of the page.
[00:53.360 --> 00:58.000]  The credit card thing works perfectly for me. I can't remember the last time that the
[00:58.000 --> 01:04.280]  credit card autofill didn't work, but the password thing drives me nuts, and sometimes
[01:04.280 --> 01:12.880]  I think it's because it's, like, I've already saved a password for www.example.com, but
[01:12.880 --> 01:19.480]  right now I'm on store.example.com, and so it doesn't see it as the same website and
[01:19.480 --> 01:23.360]  doesn't fill it in. I don't even know, and then other times I think it's like you said,
[01:23.360 --> 01:28.080]  like, they don't have the password field correctly labeled as a password field.
[01:28.080 --> 01:34.760]  Yeah, I don't know. I've used one password for a long time, but the funny thing is I
[01:34.760 --> 01:43.680]  actually rarely use it, because I have this super convoluted system for passwords that
[01:43.680 --> 01:51.680]  involves a seed, a random string, shifting your fingers two things over on the keyboard.
[01:51.680 --> 01:53.720]  Sign it in detail for us, man.
[01:53.720 --> 01:59.200]  Well, no, it was basically, I actually don't mind, I feel pretty, I mean, I should never
[01:59.200 --> 02:04.120]  say this, actually I'm not going to say anything, for those that listen to ATP and
[02:04.120 --> 02:12.560]  Casey's Showbot know that challenging tech listeners to do anything is not a good idea,
[02:12.560 --> 02:16.120]  but it's quite convoluted. It would take me, like, ten minutes to explain it, which
[02:16.120 --> 02:22.400]  is hopefully a sign that it's robust. But it's good, though. Actually, I switched to
[02:22.400 --> 02:27.440]  this when the iPhone first came out and you couldn't use, like, one password or anything
[02:27.440 --> 02:33.920]  like that, and I wanted to have complex passwords and different passwords on every site, but
[02:33.920 --> 02:39.860]  still be able to somehow memorize them all. And so it's been pretty good. The most annoying
[02:39.860 --> 02:45.080]  thing is when, like, a site has a, you know, a breakdown or, you know, passwords get stolen
[02:45.080 --> 02:48.160]  and they have to reset it and then you have to, like, a backup system for sites that have
[02:48.160 --> 02:51.080]  been compromised once and it gets messy pretty quickly.
[02:51.080 --> 02:57.000]  Well, the thing that gets me is that I'm more annoyed now when I run into a site where
[02:57.000 --> 03:01.760]  the password autofill doesn't work than I was back in the days when no passwords got
[03:01.760 --> 03:02.760]  autofilled.
[03:02.760 --> 03:05.840]  Yeah, because it's like it wasn't an annoyance before.
[03:05.840 --> 03:11.000]  Right. I think it's probably, like, when they invented modern plumbing and people who
[03:11.000 --> 03:15.840]  grew up always having to go to an outhouse every time they wanted to go, and then all
[03:15.840 --> 03:19.200]  of a sudden most places had indoor plumbing, but then every once in a while you'd get to
[03:19.200 --> 03:22.400]  a place where you'd have to go out in the outhouse. It was worse. I'm sure that that
[03:22.400 --> 03:27.760]  was worse than when they were children and had to go in the outhouse every single time.
[03:27.760 --> 03:29.200]  Yep, everything's relative.
[03:29.200 --> 03:34.200]  Right. It's like once the bar is raised, you can never go back.
[03:34.200 --> 03:40.400]  Yep. I think there's probably, I was going to make some sort of, well, there's a funny
[03:40.400 --> 03:44.400]  tweet on Twitter the other day about someone's going to make a podcast cut up of everyone
[03:44.400 --> 03:49.200]  saying, can I swear? Because there's some shitty joke to be made there, except that
[03:49.200 --> 03:52.600]  I remember the last time I was on the show, that was the time I think you actually did
[03:52.600 --> 03:54.960]  get busted for swearing on your podcast.
[03:54.960 --> 03:56.920]  Oh, you think it was your, was it your episode?
[03:56.920 --> 03:59.840]  I think so. I think it was, because I think you picked me a couple days later, because
[03:59.840 --> 04:03.160]  we had talked about it on the podcast. Like, yeah, so I actually met the guy from Apple
[04:03.160 --> 04:05.320]  on podcast. He asked me to tone it down.
[04:05.320 --> 04:09.640]  Yeah, and that was the one where the shit hit the fan. Maybe. I don't remember.
[04:09.640 --> 04:13.680]  But that's funny because you don't seem, you seem like one of my least profane.
[04:13.680 --> 04:17.680]  I know. I think I had one word, but maybe it's the exact same thing you just talked
[04:17.680 --> 04:22.440]  about when there's one passer that doesn't work, it stands out more. Whereas, uh, you
[04:22.440 --> 04:26.240]  know, if there's just a whole string of expletives, they kind of just run into each other at some
[04:26.240 --> 04:32.680]  point, but there's just one, one finally placed one. It really, it really jumps out. I'd like
[04:32.680 --> 04:37.720]  to be known for that. The well-placed expletive.
[04:37.720 --> 04:45.040]  Well-placed expletive. That's a good site. Um, so I guess there's not much going on except
[04:45.040 --> 04:56.880]  that we're, it seems like everybody has collectively sort of, uh, finished digesting WWDC and Google
[04:56.880 --> 04:57.880]  IO.
[04:57.880 --> 05:01.160]  Yeah, no, I agree.
[05:01.160 --> 05:08.440]  And a couple of good pieces this week. You had a good piece on, let me try this. Stratecary.
[05:08.440 --> 05:09.440]  Stratecary.
[05:09.440 --> 05:10.440]  Second one's the charm.
[05:10.440 --> 05:12.000]  Stratecary. Cause it's tech.
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.800]  Yep. And I did switch it up. So it's my fault that now no one knows how to say it.
[05:16.800 --> 05:22.600]  Uh, but you did have a good piece on, on Samsung cause that's the other, a little tidbit and
[05:22.600 --> 05:28.680]  who knows, you know, one, one quarter is, is a data point, not necessarily a trend.
[05:28.680 --> 05:32.000]  Um, but Samsung had a, had a pretty bad quarter.
[05:32.000 --> 05:37.640]  Yeah. I mean, their last one wasn't hot either. So this is, it was soft, I think is the word
[05:37.640 --> 05:44.280]  that they use. Um, so this is, uh, this is not by any means out of the blue.
[05:44.280 --> 05:51.080]  Right. Um, well let's talk about them first. I think in broad strokes, what it seems like
[05:51.080 --> 06:00.080]  we're seeing is that Samsung had for a while occupied a certain middle ground floating,
[06:00.080 --> 06:07.680]  you know, making some money on a lot of high quantity of lower end smartphones and a decent
[06:07.680 --> 06:14.880]  sized chunk of higher end smartphones. But that there we're seeing signs that they're
[06:14.880 --> 06:19.800]  getting pinched on both sides, that Apple still, it dominates the high end and as you
[06:19.800 --> 06:27.120]  know, has the throughout the whole era of smartphones in terms of profit, uh, and revenue.
[06:27.120 --> 06:35.040]  And on the low end, they're running into various competitors. Right. And China in particular
[06:35.040 --> 06:37.160]  with a, how do you, how do you say it?
[06:37.160 --> 06:38.160]  Uh, Xiaomi.
[06:38.160 --> 06:40.720]  Xiaomi. Now how do you spell that?
[06:40.720 --> 06:48.040]  Uh, X, I, A, O, M, I, which is the, the, it's actually, it's originally a Chinese character
[06:48.040 --> 06:53.520]  and that's how you use what's called pinyin to, to write it in English. So, but it actually,
[06:53.520 --> 06:56.720]  it works, it works well. Any name with an X in it looks good.
[06:56.720 --> 07:02.120]  And it's, it's, it's a company that's very interesting to me and you know far more about
[07:02.120 --> 07:05.520]  them than, than I do. It's actually one of the main reasons I thought to invite you on
[07:05.520 --> 07:09.960]  the show this week. And if I don't know a lot about them, I can't help but think that
[07:09.960 --> 07:14.200]  there's an awful lot of listeners of the show who don't and maybe even haven't heard of
[07:14.200 --> 07:21.640]  them before. But I think, uh, I think they should be on everybody's radar, especially
[07:21.640 --> 07:25.920]  when it comes to Samsung. Even though I think for the last year or so, there's been a lot
[07:25.920 --> 07:33.920]  of stuff in the press and in the investor world that sort of has them as an, uh, somebody
[07:33.920 --> 07:37.400]  who Apple should be looking out for. But I think, I think it's actually, I think you've
[07:37.400 --> 07:39.880]  made this point pretty well that it's Samsung.
[07:39.880 --> 07:45.080]  Well there, I mean, I think the, the number one thing about Xiaomi in particular is, uh,
[07:45.080 --> 07:51.560]  is you have to really, um, and there was this really like breathless like feature in Bloomberg
[07:51.560 --> 07:55.480]  and they had like Xiaomi week, you know, like talk about Xiaomi that this big, this big thing
[07:55.480 --> 08:03.500]  that like you have to clearly delineate between China and the rest of the world. And, um,
[08:03.500 --> 08:09.020]  and in China, Xiaomi deserves all the hype. Like they are, they're killing it. Um,
[08:09.020 --> 08:14.540]  they are a Chinese company. They are a Chinese company. And, and just in general, and this
[08:14.540 --> 08:20.000]  goes for a lot of the Chinese companies in general, like, like China really is its own
[08:20.000 --> 08:26.040]  completely separate world where very little applies to what happens the rest of the world,
[08:26.040 --> 08:30.440]  particularly in the West and vice versa. And a lot of that's because of the great firewall.
[08:30.440 --> 08:35.240]  Um, part of it is because of, you know, just cultural differences. Um, and part of it just
[08:35.240 --> 08:40.960]  is it's such a huge market. It's like, I mean, U.S., U.S. companies get criticized for being,
[08:40.960 --> 08:44.920]  you know, too U.S. focused, but why wouldn't they be? It's, you know, it's 300 million
[08:44.920 --> 08:49.840]  of the richest consumers in the world. Like it makes sense to start out there. Same thing
[08:49.840 --> 08:53.800]  if you're a Chinese company, like you're, you're sitting, you have a billion customers,
[08:53.800 --> 09:01.040]  um, a very large, you know, again, this, an absolute number of which are very rich, um,
[09:01.040 --> 09:06.960]  and a good number of which are getting richer. Um, so why not focus there? And, um, and so
[09:06.960 --> 09:10.720]  that's just, it just didn't, anytime you talk about Xiaomi or anything about China, it's
[09:10.720 --> 09:14.760]  really important to kind of like draw the two. Um, I think Xiaomi is not much of a threat
[09:14.760 --> 09:18.800]  outside China. Um, but in China they are, they're a big deal. And in China they're a
[09:18.800 --> 09:24.160]  threat to Apple as well. Um, and, but that's why you have to make the distinction, right?
[09:24.160 --> 09:30.440]  And China is big enough that, that even if they're a Chinese only company, it's, it's
[09:30.440 --> 09:33.400]  big enough to matter. Oh, it's big enough to matter. I mean, Apple, China's going to
[09:33.400 --> 09:39.000]  be Apple's biggest market in like five years or something. Like, so it, it matters just
[09:39.000 --> 09:44.280]  to give you an idea of, of, of what a massive market it is. Like, and so it does matter
[09:44.280 --> 09:51.160]  even if, even if, uh, Xiaomi, uh, only threatened Samsung in China or only threatened Apple
[09:51.160 --> 09:56.600]  in China because China is such a significant market for both companies. Uh, that means
[09:56.600 --> 10:05.920]  the companies as a whole are threatened. Hmm. And part of it too is this is where, um, being
[10:05.920 --> 10:12.800]  based on Android can work in their favor is if they were running their own proprietary
[10:12.800 --> 10:18.240]  platform, it might be a problem that they were strong only in China. Right. Right. Like
[10:18.240 --> 10:24.180]  maybe sort of like what, what Blackberry was like back when Blackberry had a huge market
[10:24.180 --> 10:30.000]  share in the U S and, and was sort of non-existent elsewhere. This is now, this is going back
[10:30.000 --> 10:35.200]  pre iPhone. This is like early two thousands when, when Blackberry was this abnormality.
[10:35.200 --> 10:39.520]  It worked for them because they didn't need software. It wasn't really about apps yet.
[10:39.520 --> 10:43.840]  It was just about communicating. And the people in the U S who had Blackberries were for the
[10:43.840 --> 10:48.320]  most part communicating with other people at Blackberry. So it was, it was okay. Whereas
[10:48.320 --> 10:57.160]  now where you need an app ecosystem. Right. You know, Xiaomi can, can capitalize on that
[10:57.160 --> 11:02.480]  even if they're only really strong in China because Android is Android. Well, I mean that
[11:02.480 --> 11:06.680]  it's actually funny because that's the other part where China is just a different world.
[11:06.680 --> 11:14.400]  Right. We like, I, as a rule, I think we talked about this this last time, um, is, you know,
[11:14.400 --> 11:20.520]  you have to, you have to be one of the two. Um, uh, sorry, I lost my train of thought.
[11:20.520 --> 11:25.160]  Um, you have to be one of the two, but in China, that's the big exception, right? Cause
[11:25.160 --> 11:31.800]  most of phones in China are on AOSP, the open source Android. And there's a whole plethora
[11:31.800 --> 11:36.280]  of services that fill in there. Like there's UC web, which is the biggest browser. There's
[11:36.280 --> 11:41.340]  just bought by Alibaba. There is a whole bunch of app stores. Um, a few of which like there's
[11:41.340 --> 11:46.240]  been some competitions on which are kind of emerging as the key ones. And so there's almost
[11:46.240 --> 11:52.100]  like there is a whole separate ecosystem of services that most of the phones there use.
[11:52.100 --> 11:56.000]  And it actually in, so in, in China, Chinese developers are used to this, right? There's
[11:56.000 --> 12:01.520]  actually services that help you get your app on all the different stores. You can be everywhere.
[12:01.520 --> 12:07.800]  And it's funny, like if that, if that sort of whole ecosystem were in the West, uh, that
[12:07.800 --> 12:13.200]  would, it would actually totally transform the market here because it would really weaken
[12:13.200 --> 12:19.840]  the, the kind of the importance that the play store does have and kind of making, giving
[12:19.840 --> 12:24.720]  Google full control, um, of that, if that makes sense. So it's, I mean everything there
[12:24.720 --> 12:29.120]  is just really, it's really so different and there's lots of things that are interesting
[12:29.120 --> 12:34.040]  for, for Western companies. It means Google's really not important at all there. Um, they're
[12:34.040 --> 12:37.120]  not important because they're blocked as far as search, but they're also not important
[12:37.120 --> 12:41.760]  because they don't really control Android there. And the only Western company actually
[12:41.760 --> 12:44.520]  that really matters is Apple. And that's because they sell hardware.
[12:44.520 --> 12:48.900]  Trenton Larkin So do you think that's already having an effect
[12:48.900 --> 12:55.520]  on Samsung's numbers or do you think it's more, it's already partly China, but is it,
[12:55.520 --> 12:58.120]  is it only China? Is it, is it worldwide?
[12:58.120 --> 13:01.700]  John Dickerson I think, um, I think for sure. So you, you
[13:01.700 --> 13:07.560]  alluded to before, I think Samsung has, has a problem on both ends. Um, the, on the high
[13:07.560 --> 13:15.840]  end, uh, they, I think they, they, they got a lot of high end customers, I think for two
[13:15.840 --> 13:20.920]  specific reasons. Again, this was more conjecture previously, but now that it's actually happening,
[13:20.920 --> 13:26.000]  I think we can say, you know, a little more certainty. Um, one was the iPhone has always
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.960]  been relatively limited when it comes to carrier distribution. Um, you know, they were, they
[13:30.960 --> 13:36.440]  were stuck at like 220 for like two or three years. And even before then there was even
[13:36.440 --> 13:43.520]  lower. Um, and, and that left a good 500 carriers around the world where there was no iPhone
[13:43.520 --> 13:47.640]  and presuming you were loyal to your carrier. And in richer countries, people tend to be
[13:47.640 --> 13:53.040]  more loyal to their carriers. Um, uh, you would, and you wanted a high end phone. Well,
[13:53.040 --> 13:58.360]  there, there was no iPhone choice. It was Samsung or HTC or whatever those. And Samsung
[13:58.360 --> 14:04.420]  has always been, you know, a very good competitor. You know, whatever you think about their design
[14:04.420 --> 14:07.720]  decision is they're, they're very well run company. They're very good competitor. They're
[14:07.720 --> 14:13.200]  have great marketing. They pull all the, all the levers. And if there were no iPhone, you
[14:13.200 --> 14:18.000]  know, they, they would continue, I think, to do very well at the high end and HTC would
[14:18.000 --> 14:23.800]  probably be doing much better as well. Um, but now the iPhone has really started to,
[14:23.800 --> 14:29.640]  uh, move, expand its carriers. And part of that is the big ones, which is NTD, Docomo
[14:29.640 --> 14:34.400]  in Japan and China Mobile in China, but also lots of little ones. Like I'm here in, in,
[14:34.400 --> 14:38.160]  I'm back in the States and I'm in Madison just for the summer. And a big carrier here
[14:38.160 --> 14:41.720]  is us cellular, right? It's the fifth largest in us, but still a lot smaller than the other
[14:41.720 --> 14:46.080]  ones. They've never had the iPhone. Now they do. And there's lots of these little ones
[14:46.080 --> 14:50.800]  that any one of them by themselves doesn't mean much. But when you're adding like 50
[14:50.800 --> 14:57.560]  of them, like Apple has that, that just increases Samsung's competition where Pusi didn't have
[14:57.560 --> 14:58.560]  any competition there.
[14:58.560 --> 15:01.720]  Yeah. It's filling out the long tail of carriers.
[15:01.720 --> 15:06.680]  Right. Exactly. Exactly. And Samsung has owned that long tail. Like Samsung's big advantage
[15:06.680 --> 15:13.880]  still remains, um, uh, their, their relationship with carriers and how they own that whole
[15:13.880 --> 15:18.040]  connection. They deliver exactly what the carriers want, what they need. Um, and really
[15:18.040 --> 15:22.240]  they've kind of stepped into the Nokia role, which that used to be Nokia. Nokia had all
[15:22.240 --> 15:26.920]  the, except for, except for the U S Nokia had relationships with every carrier. They,
[15:26.920 --> 15:30.880]  they delivered everything that the carriers wanted, they needed. And that gave them a,
[15:30.880 --> 15:34.920]  that's really important in the mobile business. And Samsung has kind of inherited that and
[15:34.920 --> 15:38.600]  they still have that advantage. Um, you know, what made the iPhone so unique when it came
[15:38.600 --> 15:43.400]  to carriers and that sort of thing was it was the first phone that people were, people
[15:43.400 --> 15:47.860]  valued the phone more than they valued their relationship with their carrier. And that
[15:47.860 --> 15:54.840]  really, you know, upset the whole apple cart and it is less in Samsung's advantage. Um,
[15:54.840 --> 15:57.480]  in the carriers where they're competing directly with, with the iPhone.
[15:57.480 --> 16:03.280]  Yeah. I think like go back, you know, pre smartphone, you know, and you'd go in and
[16:03.280 --> 16:08.680]  you know, the big ones I remember at least here in the States were always Nokia and Ericsson
[16:08.680 --> 16:14.760]  and eventually it was Sony Ericsson. Um, but they were seemed to me like somebody who never
[16:14.760 --> 16:18.720]  was really into cell phones before that. I mean, I'd have one just for the sake of making
[16:18.720 --> 16:25.720]  calls and truly rudimentary texting. Um, but it just seemed to me that those were the two
[16:25.720 --> 16:30.200]  brands and you'd go in, but it never really seemed to matter too much. You know, it was,
[16:30.200 --> 16:36.040]  it was far, far more about choosing between, you know, Verizon and singular or, or whoever,
[16:36.040 --> 16:39.160]  you know, whatever the names of the various carriers were in the States then it was really
[16:39.160 --> 16:41.840]  mostly about which carrier store you're going to go into.
[16:41.840 --> 16:49.800]  And, and even, even now, I mean, what made the iPhone so, so unique, um, is, you know,
[16:49.800 --> 16:55.640]  is the first phone that people were really willing to switch carriers for. And that gave
[16:55.640 --> 17:00.800]  Apple all the negotiating leverage with, with carriers from that, from that point on. Um,
[17:00.800 --> 17:05.440]  but even then there were, there was still a limit to the number of people who would,
[17:05.440 --> 17:08.880]  who would do that. Like, you know, there were still people who were going to stay with Verizon
[17:08.880 --> 17:16.920]  no matter what. Um, and, uh, and so it's, it's been, that dynamic, you know, has, has
[17:16.920 --> 17:23.400]  helped Samsung and continues to help them. Um, but as Apple expands, that kind of, again,
[17:23.400 --> 17:27.560]  picks off, you know, just a lot of these, the wild, the long tail, exactly as you said.
[17:27.560 --> 17:31.940]  Yeah. And you made the point that one of the things to understand the dynamics of this
[17:31.940 --> 17:36.800]  is that for practical purposes, no, it's not really a hundred percent, of course nothing
[17:36.800 --> 17:41.500]  ever is, but practically speaking, it, it's best to think of it as this, everybody is
[17:41.500 --> 17:48.480]  going to own a smartphone. Right. Which is, there's, there's very few things in the world
[17:48.480 --> 17:53.680]  that are like that, especially in tech. A lot of the things that are like that are things
[17:53.680 --> 17:59.560]  like, I don't know, like, like. Wash machines or. Yeah. Or having a toilet in your house.
[17:59.560 --> 18:04.480]  Yeah. Or TV, a TV is a good example. Sure. But that's the thing though, TVs even will
[18:04.480 --> 18:09.320]  ultimately have less penetration than, than a smartphone, which is, which is pretty amazing.
[18:09.320 --> 18:12.880]  Right. Because a lot of it's going to end up, I think maybe a little bit more towards
[18:12.880 --> 18:19.960]  one TV per household and one cell phone per person. Right. Yeah. Oh, exactly. Yep. And
[18:19.960 --> 18:24.640]  even if you go to multiple TVs per household, it still is probably going to trend not towards
[18:24.640 --> 18:30.520]  one per person, but, um, but less than one per person, maybe you'll have one in the master
[18:30.520 --> 18:35.400]  bedroom and one in the living room, but tablets are clearly eating into that, you know, where
[18:35.400 --> 18:41.320]  a lot of, you know, personal consumption of video, uh, is clearly going towards tablets
[18:41.320 --> 18:46.680]  and smartphones, you know, like, like if you know, the average number of TVs in a house,
[18:46.680 --> 18:50.800]  I'm sure has, if anything, it might be going down because if you were going to have one,
[18:50.800 --> 18:56.360]  like for your teenager and let your teenager have a TV in their room, um, that might be
[18:56.360 --> 19:02.040]  a PC and a tablet now. Right. You know, PC for the games and a tablet for watching video
[19:02.040 --> 19:07.320]  and TV. Well, just to, just to kind of rat hole a little bit more. Um, one thing that's
[19:07.320 --> 19:10.600]  actually really interesting about these Samsung results, uh, we'll get back to the high and
[19:10.600 --> 19:15.920]  low and stuff, but is they talked about the fact that they, they felt their tablet sales
[19:15.920 --> 19:22.400]  have been hurt by their big phones, their phablets, um, which, uh, which building on
[19:22.400 --> 19:25.400]  this point, I think there's, there's a lot of conjecture and I think rightly so that
[19:25.400 --> 19:32.200]  a lot of tablets are used primarily for, for TV viewing basically. Um, but actually worldwide,
[19:32.200 --> 19:36.440]  not look, you know, not the U S market where the iPad has disproportionate share, but if
[19:36.440 --> 19:40.920]  you look worldwide at tablets and, and so many people had so many observations from
[19:40.920 --> 19:49.000]  CES this year that there were a lot of the no name brand Android tablets that are clearly
[19:49.000 --> 19:52.920]  designed knowing that they're just going to be used for consuming video. Yup. And, and
[19:52.920 --> 19:59.800]  the other thing about video, um, is like video, uh, video in Asia is, is a lot different than
[19:59.800 --> 20:07.800]  here in that, um, basically everything is available very easily. Like, I mean, it's,
[20:07.800 --> 20:10.840]  yes, there's things like Hulu and Netflix here, but there's always kind of a bit of
[20:10.840 --> 20:16.480]  a challenge of seeing like whatever's up next, like whatever hot show is going on. And right
[20:16.480 --> 20:23.000]  now they're mostly Korean shows, um, like these soap operas or, uh, like once it's
[20:23.000 --> 20:29.440]  aired, it is available for streaming within like an hour. Um, if, if not faster. And it's,
[20:29.440 --> 20:32.560]  it's, it's interesting because I don't think it's actually, there's not really
[20:32.560 --> 20:36.280]  correct. It's, it's not really frowned upon. It's not, I don't think anyone really sees
[20:36.280 --> 20:41.600]  it as an issue. Um, is it legal? It's, it's not, it's, you're saying it's not legal,
[20:41.600 --> 20:47.240]  but the, the, the, the IP infrastructure there is such that nobody really, I'm not, I'm
[20:47.240 --> 20:52.840]  not sure to be honest. I mean, I, I, I, it may be one of those things where it's nominally
[20:52.840 --> 20:56.360]  legal, but like no one actually, no one, no one really cares. It is forced. It is true
[20:56.360 --> 21:02.520]  that in many countries the IP infrastructure is not there, but also, or maybe even the
[21:02.520 --> 21:06.520]  IP culture, frankly. Yeah. That's a big part of it. That's a big part of it as well.
[21:06.520 --> 21:11.200]  Um, the other thing is like, uh, yeah, just in general, there's a different, I mean,
[21:11.200 --> 21:16.320]  cause it's, it's very open, right? I mean, even in, um, in some of the more, more, you
[21:16.320 --> 21:21.480]  know, I don't, advances in the word, but, um, countries that have had a longer history
[21:21.480 --> 21:27.840]  of IP enforcement, like, like Japan or, um, I mean, Taiwan a little bit more. So, uh,
[21:27.840 --> 21:32.680]  I mean, like all those on, there's still, you can still find like counterfeit bags and
[21:32.680 --> 21:35.480]  stuff, but they're, they're more like in the alleys, right? It's not like on the street
[21:35.480 --> 21:40.560]  corner, like, like in some parts of Asia. So it's a little stronger. Um, but there's,
[21:40.560 --> 21:47.720]  yeah, they're, they're very publicly available. Um, and, and to watch them and to watch, and
[21:47.720 --> 21:52.840]  so to watch TV like that is, is very common. And, uh, I, I don't know all the countries
[21:52.840 --> 21:58.280]  in Asia, obviously, but in my experience, you know, TV is, is just as much a thing there
[21:58.280 --> 22:05.160]  as it is here, if not more so. Um, and, and so, yeah, that whole idea of that, them being
[22:05.160 --> 22:09.160]  used primarily for that use rings very, very true to me.
[22:09.160 --> 22:14.360]  Well, all right. And then you were saying that Samsung explicitly said with regard to
[22:14.360 --> 22:19.160]  their poor results or disappointing results. And it's not just that they're down, they
[22:19.160 --> 22:24.160]  were down, it was somewhere around 16% less profit than, than was expected.
[22:24.160 --> 22:28.360]  Right. I mean, that's the weird thing about reporting results, right? It's all about
[22:28.360 --> 22:32.240]  expectations. And they were, they were under their expectations, they were under analyst
[22:32.240 --> 22:36.280]  expectations and by, you know, pretty significant amount. And, um,
[22:36.280 --> 22:40.280]  So we can even, even if we go with the, hey, come on analysts, just make this stuff up
[22:40.280 --> 22:46.200]  at least Samsung's own guidance is a, you know, should be a fair measure that most companies,
[22:46.200 --> 22:49.640]  you know, usually put out guidance that they expect to at least be able to meet. Like it's
[22:49.640 --> 22:55.180]  a genuine, it's one, if it's just, you know, an Apple has run into this many times over
[22:55.180 --> 23:00.640]  the years where, where Apple will, will post results that are pretty close to their guidance,
[23:00.640 --> 23:03.960]  maybe a little up, maybe a little down, but generally pretty close. But if they're way
[23:03.960 --> 23:10.560]  less than what analysts had, had projected, it's, it's, uh, headlined as a big mess.
[23:10.560 --> 23:13.720]  Yeah. Well, it's weird because the, like the worst, so the worst thing you can do is
[23:13.720 --> 23:18.480]  miss your own guidance, right? You're going to get hammered for that. Um, the second worst
[23:18.480 --> 23:24.840]  thing you can do is missing analyst guidance, but then there's also, if your guidance is
[23:24.840 --> 23:29.560]  lower than what analysts expect your guidance to be like, and so that's, that's when
[23:29.560 --> 23:35.480]  Apple takes hits after earnings, it's usually because their guidance for the following quarter
[23:35.480 --> 23:40.040]  is lower than what analysts anticipated it would be. Um, whereas everything that happened
[23:40.040 --> 23:44.400]  in the previous quarter, like that's almost always baked in and Apple's never missed,
[23:44.400 --> 23:49.520]  like meaningfully, uh, at least in the, you know, recent history, their recent results.
[23:49.520 --> 23:55.760]  So yeah, I mean, so it's all, it's all, it's all an expectations game. I know people, um,
[23:55.760 --> 23:59.960]  get frustrated with wall street, but it's, it's a lot more, it's not as, it's not
[23:59.960 --> 24:04.400]  as ridiculous as people think. I think that the main thing with wall street is wall street
[24:04.400 --> 24:09.000]  is, is a stock inherently is all about the future. It's all about, so whatever you've
[24:09.000 --> 24:13.960]  done in the past, it's only useful in so much as it's an indicator for what will happen
[24:13.960 --> 24:17.720]  going forward, right? It's not a reward system.
[24:17.720 --> 24:20.960]  Bringing Apple into it is sort of an aside, but I think it's interesting because there
[24:20.960 --> 24:25.520]  has been, I mean, this is not, this is something that they actually, um, came out and said,
[24:25.520 --> 24:29.800]  is that we're going to try to be a little bit more accurate with our, does Apple that
[24:29.800 --> 24:33.040]  that, you know, a couple of, maybe it was a year or so ago, maybe a little bit more
[24:33.040 --> 24:36.720]  in a couple of years. But yeah. And that they said, look, we're good. We used to, you know,
[24:36.720 --> 24:42.600]  give you a lower end of our guidance, which is translated means we really low balled the
[24:42.600 --> 24:48.120]  numbers and always put out a number that we knew that we could be. And therefore, you
[24:48.120 --> 24:52.600]  know, anybody who was trying to accurately gauge, you know, what to expect from Apple
[24:52.600 --> 24:55.720]  had to pick a number that was higher than that.
[24:55.720 --> 25:02.080]  And so you had to, you know, and analysts had to pick a number that was different from
[25:02.080 --> 25:08.160]  Apple's always higher because Apple, you know, low balled it serious. I significantly low
[25:08.160 --> 25:13.960]  balled them. Um, I think that the change, you know, and this is one of those, it's something
[25:13.960 --> 25:21.000]  that started in the post Steve jobs era. Um, I think it's probably had the intended effect
[25:21.000 --> 25:26.280]  in that it seems as though Apple's guidance and Wall Street guidance have become much
[25:26.280 --> 25:34.000]  more largely aligned and whether it's a little bit up or a little bit worse, it seems like
[25:34.000 --> 25:39.520]  the stock has become a little bit less volatile just when results are, are issued.
[25:39.520 --> 25:43.160]  No, I, that's a really good point. I think you're probably exactly right that this is
[25:43.160 --> 25:49.160]  probably a cook thing. You know, jobs probably enjoyed beating expectations, you know, by
[25:49.160 --> 25:52.560]  a lot, but the reality is that actually introduced more uncertainty.
[25:52.560 --> 25:57.400]  Yeah, I think jobs, his perspective was probably along the lines of screw those guys. Screw
[25:57.400 --> 25:58.400]  them.
[25:58.400 --> 26:01.440]  Well, I think, well, jobs, jobs like the surprise, right? He liked to pop out and say, wow, look
[26:01.440 --> 26:07.480]  at we, we just murder results, right? I mean, it was another chance. Um, you know, he loved
[26:07.480 --> 26:11.840]  the reveal, um, where, but I think it was bad for Apple. You're exactly right. Because
[26:11.840 --> 26:17.000]  analysts had to make, had to pick something up. And what I just said about, about the
[26:17.000 --> 26:21.760]  current results no longer being interesting is because of this change. It's because they,
[26:21.760 --> 26:25.880]  they are almost exactly right every time. And so now everyone's focused on their, their
[26:25.880 --> 26:27.120]  going forward estimates.
[26:27.120 --> 26:32.280]  Yeah. Yeah. I think that out, I think under jobs with the low ball numbers, it was like,
[26:32.280 --> 26:38.840]  screw them, let them figure it out. Whereas the cook idea is let's help these guys out
[26:38.840 --> 26:43.780]  because they're wrong. They're always wrong because you know, we don't, we, we keep so
[26:43.780 --> 26:48.980]  much close to our best. So let's, yeah. And them being wrong hurts us. So it's in our
[26:48.980 --> 26:54.840]  interest to help these guys and give them guidance that actually is truly guidance.
[26:54.840 --> 26:59.480]  Yeah. Well, the other, I mean, this is another thing that just really a test to kind of like
[26:59.480 --> 27:07.800]  cooks. Um, how impressive cooks operation is, is how the way that Apple is so exact
[27:07.800 --> 27:12.240]  on their numbers every single time. And that, that, that goes back to the operation side
[27:12.240 --> 27:17.080]  of it. Right. Operations is, it's not just actual making, it's the predicting, it's the,
[27:17.080 --> 27:21.520]  you know, modeling, like knowing like what we're going to sell, what, and like Apple
[27:21.520 --> 27:28.160]  for, you know, ever since they did this change. And I think a horse edge has a chart, um,
[27:28.160 --> 27:32.760]  that shows like how much off they've been like has been in almost, almost exactly. And
[27:32.760 --> 27:36.940]  I think a lot of the optimism for Apple actually is because last quarter they actually did
[27:36.940 --> 27:41.580]  beat themselves right in a way that they hadn't previously. And so that showed that even Apple
[27:41.580 --> 27:48.240]  was surprised. Um, but I mean, it's, it's kind of uncanny how perfectly almost it feels
[27:48.240 --> 27:52.320]  like they can predict the future. Um, yeah. And sometimes I feel like it's because of
[27:52.320 --> 27:56.600]  changes that they couldn't foresee, like not necessarily demand, but pricing of components
[27:56.600 --> 28:01.680]  or something like that, like something maybe dropped in, you know, dropped in price and,
[28:01.680 --> 28:07.160]  and helped margins and, you know, they just couldn't foresee that, you know. Right. Well,
[28:07.160 --> 28:11.040]  I think, right now, if, if that's what happens, it's usually what it is. But I do think it
[28:11.040 --> 28:16.680]  was last quarter, like they genuinely beat their numbers and they're like, yeah, we,
[28:16.680 --> 28:21.480]  we had a really good quarter. And, um, I think that's why, like right now, you know, there
[28:21.480 --> 28:26.640]  is so much positive sentiment around Apple, I think is they've kind of, you know, the,
[28:26.640 --> 28:31.600]  the challenge with, you know, I think Apple has actually mostly gotten past the, the kind
[28:31.600 --> 28:36.240]  of big number. It's not really a big number problem, but like the, the problem where because
[28:36.240 --> 28:40.760]  they're such a big company now, like any percentage increase is going to be small because the,
[28:40.760 --> 28:48.000]  the denominator is so huge. Right. And conversely, any small percentage difference is actually
[28:48.000 --> 28:52.400]  going to be a large number of dollars. Right. Right. So Apple could miss by half a billion
[28:52.400 --> 28:56.640]  dollars and it's like, holy shit, they missed by half a billion dollars. And it's, you know,
[28:56.640 --> 29:02.640]  it's, it's a couple of percent. Right. No, exactly. And, uh, but I think like, so 2012,
[29:02.640 --> 29:08.480]  I think late 2012 was like their, their growth rate peaked, right. Ever since then, they,
[29:08.480 --> 29:14.240]  their growth has slowed considerably. And I think like that really, I think justifiably
[29:14.240 --> 29:18.360]  like really depressed the stock for, for a few years now, but I feel like, like that's
[29:18.360 --> 29:22.040]  been worked through the system. And like, this is the, like with any company that's
[29:22.040 --> 29:27.140]  like changing up, like that's just shifting in a different phase. There's, there's this
[29:27.140 --> 29:32.320]  part where it's in like a lot of stock is, is an expectation sort of thing. Like people
[29:32.320 --> 29:35.920]  understanding and grappling with your business as your business changes, there's going to
[29:35.920 --> 29:40.920]  be upheaval. And, and I think, and so you talk about a company like Intel or like Microsoft
[29:40.920 --> 29:46.880]  that has to like, that has to, you know, make big changes. Um, once the, once you get through
[29:46.880 --> 29:51.720]  those changes and you've kind of shifted expectations and people are now used to something else,
[29:51.720 --> 29:55.240]  then you actually do get more breathing room. And I actually feel like Apple has kind of
[29:55.240 --> 30:02.440]  crossed that, that has in a lot of ways, people are cool with, you know, 6% growth, 10% growth.
[30:02.440 --> 30:07.080]  Um, and whereas before they were punished because they were no longer growing, you know,
[30:07.080 --> 30:11.200]  20, 30%. Um, and I think that's, that just goes back to like, there's, there's the famous
[30:11.200 --> 30:15.720]  saying like in this, what is it in the, something about the stock market, the short term is
[30:15.720 --> 30:19.400]  a, is a something machine in the long term, it's a weighing machine. The idea is like
[30:19.400 --> 30:25.920]  over, over time, over a few years, like the stock market actually is very, very rational
[30:25.920 --> 30:30.240]  and it does exactly what you'd expect it to. And there's no point in getting caught up
[30:30.240 --> 30:34.480]  on kind of what happens day to day or quarter to quarter because it, it usually does work
[30:34.480 --> 30:36.040]  itself out in a way that makes sense.
[30:36.040 --> 30:40.800]  All right, I'm going to take a break in just a moment. Um, but I, I come back to that because
[30:40.800 --> 30:43.980]  I think it plays into the next point I wanted to talk to you about, which is software as
[30:43.980 --> 30:49.060]  differentiation, which I think, and the reason I think it's a good parlay is I think it helps
[30:49.060 --> 30:54.520]  explain Samsung's problem, which is something you wrote about this week. And I also think
[30:54.520 --> 31:00.360]  it's something that might finally be sinking in, in Wall Street's consensus, consensus
[31:00.360 --> 31:07.400]  estimate of Apple is that tablets aren't just tablets, you know, that the iPad and iPhone
[31:07.400 --> 31:12.860]  do have a sustainable position because of the differentiation. But, but hold that thought.
[31:12.860 --> 31:19.680]  Think about it while I thank our first sponsor, our good friends at Squarespace. Now you guys
[31:19.680 --> 31:23.680]  know Squarespace. I talk about them all the time because they're longtime supporters of
[31:23.680 --> 31:31.080]  this podcast and many others. Uh, you can get a free trial, 10% off if you visit squarespace.com
[31:31.080 --> 31:37.760]  and enter offer code JG, just JG my initials at checkout. What do they do? They let you,
[31:37.760 --> 31:43.680]  you sign up for Squarespace and they help you build a website and it's so easy, simple,
[31:43.680 --> 31:50.400]  easy, beautiful design, a whole bunch of beautiful templates to choose from. Drag and drop content.
[31:50.400 --> 31:54.640]  Just you don't have to code it up. You look at it and you add the features you want, position
[31:54.640 --> 31:59.680]  them on the page where you want by drag and drop. If you want to get into the nitty gritty,
[31:59.680 --> 32:04.160]  you want to edit CSS, you want to inject JavaScript and stuff like that. You can do that too.
[32:04.160 --> 32:08.520]  If you're, if you want to, if you know how to, but if you don't, you can build a complete
[32:08.520 --> 32:13.200]  website by drag and drop. The other thing Squarespace has that is, again, I'll use the
[32:13.200 --> 32:20.600]  word differentiation, is award winning 24 seven support. They do it through live chat
[32:20.600 --> 32:29.320]  and email and it's located. They have support centers in New York City, Dublin and Portland.
[32:29.320 --> 32:34.200]  Portland is new, I think. And I think the logic behind that is that's what helps them
[32:34.200 --> 32:43.760]  have 24 seven is between Dublin and New York City and Portland, Oregon. It's covered all
[32:43.760 --> 32:48.200]  across time zones. They've got plans that start at eight bucks a month, eight bucks
[32:48.200 --> 32:53.760]  and include a free domain name if you sign up for a year. Responsive design, everything
[32:53.760 --> 33:01.040]  looks great from phones and tablets to 30 inch displays and online stores. Every site
[33:01.040 --> 33:09.560]  comes with an online store. So go there. Go to squarespace.com slash groover. You can
[33:09.560 --> 33:13.440]  go that way. You can use that URL. They'll know you came from the show and when you sign
[33:13.440 --> 33:18.880]  up, use that code JG and you get 10% off your first purchase and they'll know that you're
[33:18.880 --> 33:23.760]  a listener of the talk show. So my thanks to Squarespace. All right, so tell me about
[33:23.760 --> 33:31.480]  the, tell me, you tell me about software differentiation as an advantage and the lack thereof as a
[33:31.480 --> 33:34.720]  disadvantage in the mobile.
[33:34.720 --> 33:41.200]  I think the easiest thing is look at computers. I mean like I have, if you have a MacBook,
[33:41.200 --> 33:46.840]  it runs OS 10. If you have any other computer, it runs Windows. And even if you have the
[33:46.840 --> 33:54.560]  exact same hardware, if you have a preference for OS 10, um, you're going to buy the one
[33:54.560 --> 34:01.880]  that has OS 10. And, and even if I've virtually identical hardware, if the OS 10 machine costs
[34:01.880 --> 34:06.800]  $1,000 and the windows machine costs $800, well it turns out there are a lot of people
[34:06.800 --> 34:12.680]  that will pay the extra $200 for that machine. And that $200 is pure profit, right? Even
[34:12.680 --> 34:18.840]  if they don't perceive a difference in the hardware. Exactly. Even if you're there and
[34:18.840 --> 34:26.480]  if side by side with the screens off, you don't see an advantage to the Mac book air
[34:26.480 --> 34:33.040]  versus the HP, you know, HP air, whatever they call their, their, you know, well, even
[34:33.040 --> 34:39.640]  if Apple, even if Apple licensed out, uh, their hardware, right. And it was like literally
[34:39.640 --> 34:44.240]  every single component on this computer is identical. It has the same trackpad, it has
[34:44.240 --> 34:51.200]  the same keyboard, but it doesn't run OS 10. Like people will pay a premium for that. Um,
[34:51.200 --> 34:55.720]  you know, I'm sure I'm speaking to the choir here with, you know, with you and your audience
[34:55.720 --> 35:03.480]  and, and, and by definition that premium is, is profit. Uh, because like, you know, Samsung's
[35:03.480 --> 35:07.240]  a big guy, like all these guys are big guys. HP is a big guy. Like they're, they're all
[35:07.240 --> 35:11.840]  going to get the economies of scale that Apple is getting, you know, so if the parts for
[35:11.840 --> 35:20.960]  this machine costs $750, let's say, um, and the guy who has windows charges 800, well,
[35:20.960 --> 35:26.560]  he has $50 of profit. That's not very great. Um, meanwhile, Apple's charging a thousand,
[35:26.560 --> 35:33.960]  that's $250 of profit. That's 33%. That's pretty, that's very good. Um, and that, that
[35:33.960 --> 35:39.820]  difference is solely because that it runs, it runs OS 10. And it turns out that Apple
[35:39.820 --> 35:45.280]  is the only company that, that sells OS 10 and you can't buy OS 10 separately and put
[35:45.280 --> 35:50.720]  on your own computer. You have to buy the hardware to get the software. And, and that
[35:50.720 --> 35:55.800]  makes the hardware, that makes the hardware valuable. And, um, you know, I think just
[35:55.800 --> 36:02.100]  it it's, it's, it's valuable in a way that generates profit, right? It's all, it's all
[36:02.100 --> 36:05.840]  upside because software is, software is free. Like, I mean, it doesn't, it's not free to
[36:05.840 --> 36:10.520]  make, but to make one additional copy of software is free, right? If I already have OS 10 to
[36:10.520 --> 36:15.120]  make another OS 10 is literally just clicking a button and, and it's the exact same thing
[36:15.120 --> 36:21.580]  with phones. Um, there, you know, if you prefer iOS or the iOS ecosystem, um, guess what?
[36:21.580 --> 36:26.600]  There's only one way to get iOS and that's to buy hardware from Apple. And so even if
[36:26.600 --> 36:34.140]  HTC or Samsung like made an iPhone where every single component was the same and look and
[36:34.140 --> 36:39.840]  feel was the same and the camera was the same and the button was the same, um, Apple could
[36:39.840 --> 36:46.720]  still charge a premium because people will pay for iOS. Yet iOS doesn't cost Apple anything.
[36:46.720 --> 36:52.560]  And you know, so that's, that's why Apple dominates profits. And that's why I think
[36:52.560 --> 36:59.820]  to your point why Apple, Apple is safe in a lot of ways. Like it leads to less fluctuation
[36:59.820 --> 37:05.600]  year over year and less pressure to come out with. And this is something Apple has gotten
[37:05.600 --> 37:10.220]  dinged in the press year after year after year with new iPhones. Well, geez, this is
[37:10.220 --> 37:13.800]  almost just like last year's iPhone, but it's a little smarter and the small, you know,
[37:13.800 --> 37:19.320]  a little faster and the camera's better. Uh, and I think you see that with Samsung flailing
[37:19.320 --> 37:25.040]  around with a lot of gimmickry in their new phones. Like when a year and a half ago when
[37:25.040 --> 37:29.160]  they came out with the ones that, that tried to read your eyes, you know, for, Hey, you
[37:29.160 --> 37:32.840]  look up, we'll pause the video for you or we'll scroll the webpage while you're moving
[37:32.840 --> 37:36.920]  your eyes. Uh, which wasn't, you know, and by all the reviews I've seen, wasn't really
[37:36.920 --> 37:43.140]  a good feature, but they needed some way to do that, to stay above the fray of all the
[37:43.140 --> 37:49.780]  other Android phones that are, you know, were similar to the previous Samsung phone. Whereas
[37:49.780 --> 37:56.660]  Apple doesn't really need to worry about gimmicks like that because, you know, people who want
[37:56.660 --> 38:00.620]  to buy an iPhone are going to buy the new iPhone no matter what. Right. And so, and
[38:00.620 --> 38:06.500]  the problem is, this is actually why in the long run you end up not having hardware comparable
[38:06.500 --> 38:11.000]  to Apple. Why, I mean, why doesn't some, you hear this a lot, like why aren't there any
[38:11.000 --> 38:16.620]  laptops as good as Mac books? I mean, there, there are some. Lenovo, I would, I would always
[38:16.620 --> 38:21.440]  hold up as the one who's, who's closest. And I would also take, I would take, I would take
[38:21.440 --> 38:25.380]  a ThinkPad, uh, if they had better screens, I would take a ThinkPad over a Mac book. Those
[38:25.380 --> 38:31.780]  machines are, are amazing. Well, I've always said that if I couldn't, like as a what if
[38:31.780 --> 38:36.900]  scenario, you know, it's, it's not going to happen, but if you had to choose between a,
[38:36.900 --> 38:43.100]  let's say a ThinkPad running OS 10 or a MacBook Pro running Windows, which would you prefer?
[38:43.100 --> 38:47.900]  And I, I wouldn't even hesitate. I'd rather have a ThinkPad running, um, OS 10. I don't
[38:47.900 --> 38:53.100]  think I would prefer a ThinkPad running OS 10 versus a Mac book running OS 10. Um, but
[38:53.100 --> 38:57.780]  I would at least try it. It's the software. It's an acquired taste. I get that. It's the
[38:57.780 --> 39:02.060]  software that's more important. Right. No, exactly. So what happens though is, um, so,
[39:02.060 --> 39:08.500]  let's say you start out at 0.0, right? And, uh, the Apple, you have two, you have Samsung
[39:08.500 --> 39:14.340]  and Apple say, and they make identical phones and they, and one runs Android, the other
[39:14.340 --> 39:20.660]  runs, runs OS 10 or sorry, iOS. Uh, yeah, right. Like, like hypothetically speaking,
[39:20.660 --> 39:25.700]  let's take Samsung's copying to the logical extreme and, and legalities aside, let's say
[39:25.700 --> 39:30.500]  that they made a genuine complete clone of the iPhone. Right. So, so it's perfect. It's
[39:30.500 --> 39:35.700]  exactly the same. The problem is, and so there, the problem is, is obvious is because Android's
[39:35.700 --> 39:39.740]  open and there's lots of hardware manufacturers out there. Um, someone's going to come along
[39:39.740 --> 39:44.860]  and make another, another Android phone and maybe they copy it too and they make it the
[39:44.860 --> 39:50.580]  exact same way, but what are they going to do? Samsung, so Apple's priced it at $600.
[39:50.580 --> 39:56.020]  Samsung's price at $600. Well, the other guy's gonna come in, he's gonna price it at $575
[39:56.020 --> 40:00.700]  and then everyone's going to go buy the other one. Um, and then Sam, and so what happens
[40:00.700 --> 40:03.620]  is the respond by lowering the price, but the problem is as you lower the price, now
[40:03.620 --> 40:08.500]  your margins getting compressed and so you start cutting corners. So suddenly the display
[40:08.500 --> 40:14.500]  is not quite as good or the button quality is a little lower or, you know, and so what,
[40:14.500 --> 40:21.660]  and so what happens is because you're forced to compete on price, uh, the quality actually
[40:21.660 --> 40:27.500]  ends up going down along the way because it's like, you know, it's death by a thousand cuts
[40:27.500 --> 40:33.100]  and that's why, and you saw this in, in PCs, this is why laptops have always been, uh,
[40:33.100 --> 40:38.540]  Windows laptops have mostly always been inferior from a quality perspective. It's not, it's
[40:38.540 --> 40:42.340]  not, it has nothing to do with the software per se. It's because they're stuck in this
[40:42.340 --> 40:47.260]  game where they have to find margin somewhere, right? And, but then they screw up the software
[40:47.260 --> 40:53.540]  because to try to squeeze little bits of margin margin is why they do things like pre-installed
[40:53.540 --> 41:01.820]  the Norton, uh, bug you until you try to sign up for Norton experience, right? You go in
[41:01.820 --> 41:05.820]  and buy a brand new laptop and you open it up and if it's running windows and it's from
[41:05.820 --> 41:11.260]  most OEMs, you're going to have stuff that's not from Microsoft, not officially part of
[41:11.260 --> 41:17.180]  windows and it's all annoying and it's, it's there to try to, a lot of it is there to try
[41:17.180 --> 41:21.340]  to increase the margins because Norton gives them, you know, two or three bucks for everybody
[41:21.340 --> 41:25.740]  who, who has it pre-installed. So that's actually, that's actually where most OEMs make all their
[41:25.740 --> 41:31.660]  margin. Like actually most, most computers are made at cost and then any profit margin
[41:31.660 --> 41:36.140]  they make is from the crap ware. And that's why to get a crap ware free machine, you have
[41:36.140 --> 41:42.620]  to pay more. Um, and like, and the thing is, is like the, you know, in windows, you know,
[41:42.620 --> 41:45.500]  I obviously worked for Microsoft and work for windows and they would bitch and moan
[41:45.500 --> 41:52.520]  about how terrible the hardware was, but this is all Microsoft's fault, right? They, it,
[41:52.520 --> 41:56.180]  it's one of those things where it was always to their benefit, right? The whole thing where
[41:56.180 --> 42:00.860]  you want to commoditize your compliments, like the things that are important for your
[42:00.860 --> 42:05.340]  product, but that you don't sell, you want them to be as cheap and as, as low cost as
[42:05.340 --> 42:11.660]  possible. And so it was in Microsoft's great benefit that computers decreased in costs
[42:11.660 --> 42:17.180]  so rapidly and there was all this competition and driving down prices. But the problem is,
[42:17.180 --> 42:21.420]  as with anything, you take it too far and then oops, you're stuck with, you're stuck
[42:21.420 --> 42:27.260]  with these terrible machines with creaky hinges and crap ware all over them. And, and then
[42:27.260 --> 42:31.420]  that rolls back and now it's being ascribed to Microsoft and they're like, well, Microsoft
[42:31.420 --> 42:36.700]  always has his own crappy machines and whatever. And, and it's the same thing with Google,
[42:36.700 --> 42:40.700]  except early Google's even more ruthless, right? They don't, they want everything to
[42:40.700 --> 42:44.580]  be free. They want everything to not cost anything. They want people to be online as
[42:44.580 --> 42:50.100]  much as possible, as easily as possible. And they are more than happy to watch Samsung
[42:50.100 --> 42:56.400]  and HTC and everyone kind of kill themselves here. And again, Google's quite smart about
[42:56.400 --> 43:00.120]  this because to our earlier point, because smartphones are going to be everywhere, everyone's
[43:00.120 --> 43:07.900]  going to have one. Like there, there really is no floor to like how cheap or crappy a,
[43:07.900 --> 43:10.660]  a phone can be because someone is going to buy it.
[43:10.660 --> 43:17.140]  Right. There's a tweet from earlier today. I think it was earlier. Yeah. Earlier today
[43:17.140 --> 43:23.940]  from our mutual friend Benedict Evans. And I think it's very, very well some summarizes
[43:23.940 --> 43:30.100]  the situation in the longterm. Here's this whole tweet. Posit OEMs will be able to differentiate
[43:30.100 --> 43:39.220]  on this common platform has been a false promise for 30 years, right? That's because, and kicking
[43:39.220 --> 43:42.620]  it old school here, but I mean, this was something like when Apple was in trouble in the nineties
[43:42.620 --> 43:47.260]  that was over and over and over again. People would say, well, what Apple should do is start
[43:47.260 --> 43:54.180]  making windows machines too, and differentiate on, on design, right? So Apple, you know,
[43:54.180 --> 43:57.600]  Apple's strength isn't Mac OS are getting killed because the Mac is so much smaller
[43:57.600 --> 44:01.740]  than windows and everybody's on windows. What Apple's good at is design. So Apple should
[44:01.740 --> 44:07.820]  make windows machines and differentiate on design. And that's, it's, uh, actually that's
[44:07.820 --> 44:14.060]  exactly, I would say that's exactly the Sony PC business, right? That was the art, you
[44:14.060 --> 44:18.140]  know, the whole idea of Sony's piece. Right. And how'd that work out?
[44:18.140 --> 44:23.860]  They bio is now its own company and anybody losing one at that. Um,
[44:23.860 --> 44:30.140]  I would say Sony gave that as good a run as anybody. Yeah. And they were very nice computers.
[44:30.140 --> 44:38.660]  Right. And, and, you know, innovative in certain ways too. Like VAO's got small, like usable
[44:38.660 --> 44:43.660]  small laptops, you know, way before everyone else, right before everyone else with, you
[44:43.660 --> 44:50.100]  know, with, with minimal compromises. Uh, and it just, it's not sustainable on a common
[44:50.100 --> 44:54.900]  platform. Yeah. No, it's like, um, I think like the analogy is almost like air travel
[44:54.900 --> 44:57.340]  and this is, I'm not sure if this is going to work cause it literally just occurred to
[44:57.340 --> 45:02.540]  me. Um, but like everyone like bitches about like, Oh, we want good service on airplanes
[45:02.540 --> 45:07.560]  and like we want more seats, more, more seating area and stuff like that. The problem is every
[45:07.560 --> 45:12.220]  single time an airline tries that like continental do the thing where we're going to have better
[45:12.220 --> 45:15.340]  service. American airlines did a thing where we're going to have, you know, more, more
[45:15.340 --> 45:18.540]  room in our aisles and we're going to advertise based on that. And we're going to be able
[45:18.540 --> 45:22.980]  to, to charge a, you know, a slightly higher price. Well guess what? Everyone kept going
[45:22.980 --> 45:26.860]  to Expedia or a kayak or whatever and picking the lowest, the lowest number.
[45:26.860 --> 45:32.740]  This is very painful to me because, um, I had two or three years ago, Virgin America
[45:32.740 --> 45:39.300]  came to Philadelphia and, and it was the most welcome breath of fresh air in the history
[45:39.300 --> 45:46.340]  of PHL International Airport. Uh, and they are leaving Philadelphia International Airport
[45:46.340 --> 45:51.500]  in two months because no one wants to pay. Well, it's not, you know, and they're not
[45:51.500 --> 45:55.560]  going away, but it's clearly, it wasn't a big success for them and they were always
[45:55.560 --> 46:00.100]  more expensive. U.S. Air is the carrier that dominates PHL and you know, it's one of their
[46:00.100 --> 46:06.980]  hubs and they're there. They've got this merger with American and part of the concessions
[46:06.980 --> 46:14.980]  for this merger is they had to give up Gates at, um, Washington and one of the New York
[46:14.980 --> 46:22.860]  ones. I, I'm guessing it's probably JFK because JFK is bigger. Um, that, that combined U.S.
[46:22.860 --> 46:28.480]  Air and American have to give up some, some number of their Gates at those and Virgin
[46:28.480 --> 46:32.060]  decided to take, I think, I don't know if they took them at Washington too, but I know
[46:32.060 --> 46:36.300]  that they took some of their JFK ones and they literally don't have enough airplanes.
[46:36.300 --> 46:39.740]  So they have to take the airplanes that have been flying to Philly roots and they're going
[46:39.740 --> 46:44.980]  to be flying JFK roots and they're, they're like, it's like a waiting list. It's like
[46:44.980 --> 46:49.660]  trying to get Washington Redskins season tickets or something. That's like, uh, there's, there's
[46:49.660 --> 46:54.460]  like a five year waiting list to get new airplanes from Boeing or something like that. They can't
[46:54.460 --> 46:58.740]  just order them. Yeah. And I don't think that they were, I, you know, I'm pretty sure Virgin
[46:58.740 --> 47:02.420]  America has never turned a profit anyway on a quarter. No, well, yeah, I was going to
[47:02.420 --> 47:07.540]  mention that. Um, like it just doesn't work because it's one of those things like air,
[47:07.540 --> 47:12.860]  air travel is a, is a commodity and, and it's so, it's, I don't know, I think the analogy
[47:12.860 --> 47:17.940]  sort of holds up. It is a commodity and it's, there's an economy of scale. Like it's, that's
[47:17.940 --> 47:22.300]  the thing is that you've kind of in there, that's the magic. You've got to get off the
[47:22.300 --> 47:30.840]  ground somehow and get this, this, uh, mass of, of users to sustain it if you're going
[47:30.840 --> 47:35.500]  to be different. Yeah. It just don't have it that you Virgin America just didn't have
[47:35.500 --> 47:40.820]  at least out of Philly. And you know, yup. I think there's the whole business thing,
[47:40.820 --> 47:46.140]  right? Cause they're the ones that are price insensitive. Um, and yeah, I don't know. We're
[47:46.140 --> 47:50.340]  not an airlines. It is funny though. There's actually a ton of people that I know. I myself
[47:50.340 --> 47:54.780]  am kind of an arrow arrow airlines geek. There's some people I follow on Twitter and it's funny.
[47:54.780 --> 48:00.460]  There's actually, it seems like there's quite a few people in, in, in tech or whatever that
[48:00.460 --> 48:05.660]  as a side thing, like love to follow like the airline industry. Um, it's so much better
[48:05.660 --> 48:10.580]  than others. I mean I, and I'm more, I actually have gold status on us air cause I, that's
[48:10.580 --> 48:14.180]  all I ever fly. I mean every flight I take, whether it's a vacation or whether it's work
[48:14.180 --> 48:19.700]  to go to the west coast, it's always us air. And because so many of my flights are entirely
[48:19.700 --> 48:24.980]  across the country, I've somehow gotten to gold status, uh, which is good customer service
[48:24.980 --> 48:29.740]  wise. Like I can book tickets now that, uh, that are like refundable. I can change my
[48:29.740 --> 48:34.660]  tickets and not, not pay a fee, like literally not even pay like a nominal fee. It's kind
[48:34.660 --> 48:40.180]  of awesome. And if I could book a flight on Virgin America and it costs more, I would
[48:40.180 --> 48:45.300]  do it in a heartbeat because it's such a nicer experience. Unfortunately, you know, you,
[48:45.300 --> 48:50.380]  you have a, you know, well known reputation for valuing quality and the products you buy
[48:50.380 --> 48:56.020]  that, that is, that is not broadly shared. I've been on, I've been on flights. I can't
[48:56.020 --> 49:01.540]  remember the last time I flew in, you know, for the most part it was all SFO to Philly.
[49:01.540 --> 49:05.500]  Although sometimes depending on the hour I would, I would even take, this is what I would
[49:05.500 --> 49:13.540]  do too, is I would fly Philly to LAX, LAX to SFO on Virgin rather than a nonstop, which
[49:13.540 --> 49:17.720]  I have numerous, numerous choices between SFO and Philly on us air. Right. Rather have
[49:17.720 --> 49:21.980]  the layover in LAX. Oh yeah. And once, once you're flying far enough it, it makes enough
[49:21.980 --> 49:28.500]  of a difference. Right. Especially with Wi-Fi. It's everything. I mean, it's just so much
[49:28.500 --> 49:33.560]  more comfortable. The plane doesn't have the funky smell, you know, the, the, I don't know,
[49:33.560 --> 49:37.340]  but anyway, but yeah, there's not enough people like me to get it off the ground. It's funny
[49:37.340 --> 49:42.020]  because we should probably stop right on airlines. But, um, you know, I'm based in Asia where
[49:42.020 --> 49:47.340]  like flying economy class on an Asian airline is like flying like above first class on a
[49:47.340 --> 49:54.780]  typical us airline. Um, but it's, I just, it's us like has like Stockholm syndrome.
[49:54.780 --> 49:57.620]  Like there was like business insider, right? They always do like the, Oh, I flew on this
[49:57.620 --> 50:02.180]  airline and like everyone clicks on it 5 million times. Um, but I think Steve, Steve Kovach
[50:02.180 --> 50:06.260]  did one that he's like Singapore air and he's like marveling at like every seat had like
[50:06.260 --> 50:12.920]  its own television. It's like, Oh, first class. I forgot how bad, no, in economy. First class
[50:12.920 --> 50:17.380]  on U S air is literally just a bigger seat. They do give you a meal. They do give you
[50:17.380 --> 50:22.340]  a meal that you don't get back there, but it's so bad that, I mean, you're a, honestly,
[50:22.340 --> 50:27.380]  you're a fool if you eat it. I think, I mean, you're just asking to be made sick. I mean,
[50:27.380 --> 50:31.460]  and you get drinks. So, I mean, you know, it's a bigger seat and you get, you get alcoholic
[50:31.460 --> 50:37.340]  drinks. Um, that's it. Which one should not frown upon too, too much. But, um, no, but
[50:37.340 --> 50:42.900]  it, you know, it's, it's, it's so much different than international airlines. Yeah. So we are
[50:42.900 --> 50:47.860]  massively, it was funny. So we are way off, right? So that, that, that Samsung, I don't
[50:47.860 --> 50:52.300]  know that we're way off though. I do think it kind of explained the race to the bottom
[50:52.300 --> 50:59.020]  in, you know, on a commodity platform like windows. And I think that's where Android
[50:59.020 --> 51:04.060]  is heading. The weird thing with what makes it different though. Um, and the weird, well,
[51:04.060 --> 51:07.660]  maybe it's the same because the thing with an airline is because it is super heavily
[51:07.660 --> 51:11.660]  regulated, right? Like you, there's a certain like floor of service. Like even if you fly
[51:11.660 --> 51:14.980]  like frontier or spirit or whatever, like the really crap, you know, like the cheap
[51:14.980 --> 51:20.020]  ones are like, you can feel reasonably confident that they're going to get you there in one
[51:20.020 --> 51:23.980]  piece, right? Like because they all have to pass the same FAA regulations, they all have
[51:23.980 --> 51:30.120]  to have the same maintenance, like, you know, regimes. And so because of that, like, it's
[51:30.120 --> 51:35.260]  not like you're flying and like, wow, this guy's like $300 cheaper, but they have a plane
[51:35.260 --> 51:42.380]  crash every other week, right? Like it, everyone's, everyone's at a certain level. Um, and what's
[51:42.380 --> 51:45.980]  happening with smartphones is you're getting actually a similar, a similar idea. Like a
[51:45.980 --> 51:51.740]  few years ago, even a couple of years ago, the difference between a $200 smartphone and
[51:51.740 --> 51:57.380]  a $400 smartphone was, was huge. Um, now there really isn't that much of a difference at
[51:57.380 --> 52:03.140]  all. And by the way, that $200 smartphone is now $100 smartphone or $150 smartphone.
[52:03.140 --> 52:10.340]  And so like the, the, the, the difference between the high and low end is shrinking.
[52:10.340 --> 52:14.900]  And what's funny is everyone uses this to say why Apple's doomed, but they're only doomed
[52:14.900 --> 52:18.540]  if you ignore the software, right? All those, and this is actually, I think the first time
[52:18.540 --> 52:21.380]  you ever linked to me, I'd have been this article, like I said, well over a year ago
[52:21.380 --> 52:28.820]  that Samsung was in trouble because, um, unlike Apple, there's nothing to make a Samsung phone
[52:28.820 --> 52:37.500]  different from a no-name phone. Um, and, and especially in China where, uh, in China, like
[52:37.500 --> 52:40.580]  there's, there, well, first off there's a few things, fewer things are different China.
[52:40.580 --> 52:45.300]  Like one, there's just way more because that's where all the manufacturing happens. Like
[52:45.300 --> 52:50.020]  there's just way more phones there. There's way more companies making phones, the vast
[52:50.020 --> 52:54.020]  majority of which don't export at all. So there's tons and tons and tons of, of quote
[52:54.020 --> 52:58.980]  unquote brands in China, most of whom I've never heard of much less, much less anyone else.
[52:58.980 --> 53:05.180]  So one, there's just way more competition. Uh, and then two, uh, in China, most for the
[53:05.180 --> 53:12.100]  most, it's much more so the phone is separate from the, from the plan. So you, you, you
[53:12.100 --> 53:16.860]  usually not always, I mean, and actually the iPhone has pushed more of a subsidization
[53:16.860 --> 53:20.860]  into the system, but especially traditionally, it's always been very separate where you buy
[53:20.860 --> 53:27.300]  your, your, you buy your service from the carrier and you buy your device from a device
[53:27.300 --> 53:28.300]  seller.
[53:28.300 --> 53:32.900]  Like there are different transactions. And so that, that neuters Samsung's carrier advantage.
[53:32.900 --> 53:39.180]  It doesn't really exist as much there. Um, and then you add on top of that, Samsung did
[53:39.180 --> 53:42.760]  have more of a prestigious brand in China. Like if you're going to buy, it'd be better
[53:42.760 --> 53:49.180]  to buy a $200 Samsung phone than a $200 Chinese phone because Samsung was a meaningful brand.
[53:49.180 --> 53:53.860]  And that's where you get into that massive spend that, that Samsung still has on, on
[53:53.860 --> 53:54.860]  marketing.
[53:54.860 --> 54:00.940]  Totally, totally. But, but Xiaomi's just destroyed that. Like that's like Xiaomi is Xiaomi, what
[54:00.940 --> 54:05.820]  Xiaomi really does have a lot in common with Apple is like Xiaomi's founders are like rock
[54:05.820 --> 54:10.380]  stars, right? They are the Steve jobs and, uh, you know, and the, the Craig Federighis
[54:10.380 --> 54:16.140]  of, of, um, of China and their phones actually do, I've never held one in my hand, so I can't
[54:16.140 --> 54:20.940]  speak to build quality, but you take a look at them and they do to me, to my eyes instantly
[54:20.940 --> 54:25.580]  look better designed than Samsung and most other brands.
[54:25.580 --> 54:30.900]  Yeah. And they're the quality, the quality is decent. I'm the, I've held both iron and
[54:30.900 --> 54:35.820]  the low end. The low end was, was, wasn't the most previous one. It was a little like,
[54:35.820 --> 54:42.860]  I thought it was a little flimsier, but it wasn't, it was a fully functional, like there's
[54:42.860 --> 54:47.020]  no problem to use this day to day. You can tell it's a couple hundred bucks cheaper than
[54:47.020 --> 54:52.460]  its sibling. Um, but again, that's, that's improving as well. Like those are way better
[54:52.460 --> 54:56.980]  than what was available at the price point previously. And, and so for Xiaomi and then
[54:56.980 --> 55:00.860]  Xiaomi has like, you know, so they have these rock stars and they, there's the whole Chinese
[55:00.860 --> 55:05.220]  like social network, you know, the, which we talked about last time, the WeChat and,
[55:05.220 --> 55:09.360]  and all these sort of things where they, where they actually sell, they sell completely online.
[55:09.360 --> 55:13.020]  So they don't have to pay any overhead to carriers. They pay nothing for marketing.
[55:13.020 --> 55:17.220]  They just basically sell everything through their brand and through their website. And
[55:17.220 --> 55:21.300]  so they can keep their costs super low. And then their whole business model is to basically
[55:21.300 --> 55:25.300]  sell at cost, right? They say they're going to make it up by selling, by selling services,
[55:25.300 --> 55:31.060]  by selling, you know, app store and all that sort of stuff. And, and Samsung is just getting
[55:31.060 --> 55:36.020]  walloped. Like Samsung can't compete with that. And that's why Apple is more threatened
[55:36.020 --> 55:40.740]  in China by Xiaomi as well, because Xiaomi isn't just cheap. They're, they're cheap.
[55:40.740 --> 55:46.300]  And they're, they're a brand and they're like, they're a statement like they're, you're saying
[55:46.300 --> 55:50.900]  something by carrying a Xiaomi phone. And that is been Apple selling point in China,
[55:50.900 --> 55:55.860]  always like China. Yes, the software is important, but it's not, it's actually, I think it's
[55:55.860 --> 56:01.500]  less, it's less of a differentiator in, in China, especially because there's all, there's
[56:01.500 --> 56:06.060]  all lots of crazy stuff you can do with Android, right? That, that the Chinese, that Chinese
[56:06.060 --> 56:12.140]  value and whereas Apple, the lockdown actually works against them a lot of ways. It is actually
[56:12.140 --> 56:16.740]  an area where like the, the keyboards are going to help. That's, I, there's lots of
[56:16.740 --> 56:22.340]  alternate Chinese keyboards that I, I know people that's been a, a holdup for not wanting
[56:22.340 --> 56:26.260]  to go, go with iOS. But even beyond that, there's tons of stuff like the, the whole
[56:26.260 --> 56:30.420]  idea of skinning stuff and having all these cutesy things and all this, all this stuff
[56:30.420 --> 56:35.300]  on our phone that we in the West feels very, very is like weird like that. It's just different
[56:35.300 --> 56:39.940]  there. Like you go to, you go to like Yahoo China or, or Alibaba in China or Baidu or
[56:39.940 --> 56:44.020]  like the pages are all busy and there's links everywhere and they're just like, they hurt
[56:44.020 --> 56:50.300]  your eyes. Like it's just a very different aesthetic. And so in Xiaomi delivers all that
[56:50.300 --> 56:55.860]  and they let you customize, let you do this, all this store stuff, yet they're also cool.
[56:55.860 --> 57:01.980]  And so that, but all those advantages only exist in China. And so that's why Xiaomi is
[57:01.980 --> 57:08.420]  a big deal in China, but I'm way more skeptical about them outside of China because it just
[57:08.420 --> 57:09.420]  doesn't translate as much.
[57:09.420 --> 57:12.500]  All right, let's hold this thought cause we'll pick it right back up. I know where I want
[57:12.500 --> 57:18.820]  to go, but I want to thank our second sponsor, another long time supporter of the show, our
[57:18.820 --> 57:29.380]  good friends at back blaze back blaze as online backup for your Mac on throttled and unlimited.
[57:29.380 --> 57:34.460]  You download back blaze, you get a free trial risk free, no credit card required to sign
[57:34.460 --> 57:41.020]  up. Just go to back blaze.com slash during fireball, download it. You have 30 days. See
[57:41.020 --> 57:46.380]  how it works completely. And after that, only after that, do they ask you for a credit card
[57:46.380 --> 57:50.660]  and I guarantee you you're probably going to sign up because it's great. They have over
[57:50.660 --> 57:56.980]  100 petabytes of data backed up among all their users. Now, last week I said, I don't
[57:56.980 --> 58:02.060]  even know how much that is. Our good friends at back blaze, they got in touch. So one petabyte
[58:02.060 --> 58:08.540]  is a thousand terabytes. They have a hundred petabytes of data backed up. That's how much
[58:08.540 --> 58:14.980]  they have stored. They've just crossed the 6 billion file Mark for how many files have
[58:14.980 --> 58:22.500]  been restored by users. In other words, users of back blaze have restored 6 billion files
[58:22.500 --> 58:28.500]  that have been backed up by back blaze. Lots of users, a great track record, great software
[58:28.500 --> 58:35.500]  and iPad, an iPhone app. I mean, um, to access and share any of your files from anywhere
[58:35.500 --> 58:39.660]  you can restore one file at a time. If it's just like, Oh my God, I just need that one
[58:39.660 --> 58:42.520]  thing. I don't know where it is. It's not on my machine anymore, but I bet it back blaze
[58:42.520 --> 58:48.460]  has it backed up. Uh, or all of your files easily with the web restore and 25% of all
[58:48.460 --> 58:52.860]  restores though are just one file. Uh, it's not just for computer disasters, although
[58:52.860 --> 58:58.940]  it's great peace of mind and a great service. If you do run into a disaster, um, founded
[58:58.940 --> 59:03.960]  by X Apple engineers, it runs natively on your Mac and on Mavericks. There's no add
[59:03.960 --> 59:11.740]  ons, no gimmicks, no additional charges. It's just five bucks a month per computer for unlimited
[59:11.740 --> 59:18.140]  unthrottle backup. Go to back blaze.com slash daring fireball and just download it if you
[59:18.140 --> 59:22.460]  haven't already. So my thanks to them. So I think the irony, the irony of the whole
[59:22.460 --> 59:30.260]  Samsung Apple thing is that the re the, the, the consensus refrain against Apple. Uh, I
[59:30.260 --> 59:33.900]  would say while, while like the stock was depressed after Tim Cook first took over,
[59:33.900 --> 59:39.980]  uh, is that they, it's unsustainable for the minority market share or OS to, you know,
[59:39.980 --> 59:45.140]  that they, they can't sustain it against Android. It's inevitable that it's going
[59:45.140 --> 59:50.680]  to be all commoditized and the whole thing's going to collapse. Um, and Samsung is going
[59:50.680 --> 59:55.260]  to beat them. Samsung is more innovative than Apple. They can't, they can't beat Samsung.
[59:55.260 --> 01:00:00.060]  I think the irony is that it's really all those arguments really do apply, but they
[01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:05.340]  don't apply to Apple. They apply to Samsung. Yup. You know, that the, the, the knock against
[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:13.460]  Apple for most of 2011, 2012, maybe even into 2013 really was the case against Samsung.
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:18.740]  That the, that the differentiation that they had for a while was not sustainable. No, that's,
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:22.060]  that's exactly it. I mean, I think like, like I said, I think this is when we first
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:29.020]  connected was, you know, I wrote a piece called two bears like that. Basically it's, it's
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:35.020]  this point it's like for some reason, and it's funny, like, uh, I wrote another piece,
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:40.380]  two bears revisited, where I drudged up like some old like PC reviews of like Mac books,
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:44.740]  right. And in, in every single one of them, they don't talk about the operating system.
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:49.060]  They talk about like what ports it has, the screen quality, the keyboard quality. And
[01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:54.820]  it's like, and analysts do the same thing. And it's, it's just, it's so weird, right?
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:01:01.680]  It's like, how can you, how like, I think the vast majority of the Apple is doomed narrative
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:07.500]  comes from people that fundamentally don't grok the, the software differentiation angle,
[01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:12.660]  right. And if you don't understand that, then yes, Apple is doomed. They're selling
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:16.500]  very expensive gadgets when you can get a perfectly good gadget for a quarter of the
[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:17.500]  price.
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:28.740]  Right. And it's, um, it's almost impossible to overstate just how high the table stakes
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:37.140]  are to get into that. Oh, you know that, that, you know, so, so clearly the biggest thing
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:41.280]  that's happened in tech, I mean, I mean, we spent most of the last seven years talking
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:45.780]  about one thing, which is the revolution that iOS sparked. And it's not all about iOS cause
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:53.380]  Android followed, but it's changed the world. But it, it wasn't just that Apple in 2005
[01:01:53.380 --> 01:02:00.500]  through 2007 was able to create iOS. It, that whole iOS entirely is based on work that started
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:08.100]  in 1988 with, uh, with next and that in some sense it was a continuous effort. Not that
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:14.340]  that in 1988 or 1989 that next had in mind something like the iPhone, but there's so
[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:20.100]  much that is shared and that is built on, you know, and why, you know, for example,
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:24.340]  it's just the simple aspect of, and you know, it was just something that came up once again,
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:27.700]  just every single year, just like it being the year of Linux. This is the year where
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:33.700]  Android gets 60 frames per second animation. Why does it, does the iPhone have better,
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:38.560]  less stuttery scrolling and animation than Android? Uh, it's not because of work that
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:43.420]  Apple did, not only because of work that Apple had did in 2006 through the present, it's
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:46.060]  because of work that, that Apple has done since 1988.
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:52.780]  Well, and why it's on the same point, uh, windows phone came out after Android yet windows
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:58.860]  phone has always had better animation. Exactly. Microsoft's been writing device drivers since
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:03.380]  the eighties, right? And, and it has always to their credit for all the knocks you can
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:12.180]  give against windows up until, uh, Vista, uh, had a, you know, a tremendous reputation
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:16.780]  for it. At least the interface in windows was snappy and responsive, right? Especially
[01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:23.340]  like, you know, XP versus the early versions of Mac OS 10. You know, Apple wasn't Apple
[01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:27.860]  felt Apple's interface felt slower because they were doing such so much more graphically.
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:33.220]  It was like a long play that got them to where they could do these things like the, the,
[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:38.060]  you know, stuff. But anyway, following different paths and with different priorities, Microsoft
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:44.820]  and Apple both have decades of work that, that the that's resulted in the snappiness
[01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:51.240]  of the interfaces you see today. And so it's, it's, it's just so hard to overstate how hard
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:59.220]  it would be for somebody like Tizen or like Samsung to get Tizen established as a, a true
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:04.100]  peer to those platforms. Yeah. Well, I mean, I think, yeah, cause I mean, it's easy to
[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:08.820]  look at the, the app store and that's certainly a big part of it, but like, I mean, if you
[01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:12.100]  think about that, that's another part of the table stakes at this point though, because
[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:19.740]  it wasn't in 2007 or 2008, but now it is, that's my point, right? Cause everyone, everyone,
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:23.020]  you can stop there and say, that's reason enough that no one else is going to, is going
[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:27.500]  to break in. But if you look at iOS, like I, to me, there's like three, I mean, everything's
[01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:33.100]  Unix, right? But there's three kind of seminal proprietary things that happen that made iOS
[01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:41.740]  one. And one is next back in the eighties. So that's where it started. Two was the iTunes
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:48.220]  store. And then three was, was the app store, which I guess, which I guess is part of that,
[01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:56.980]  but like the, what makes iOS, what it is, has been a decade long process. And, and that,
[01:04:56.980 --> 01:05:00.980]  and that's, that's the thing, right? It's not just that Apple's differentiated. It's
[01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:05.780]  almost a little too simple to say Apple products are differentiated by software because it
[01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:12.180]  really is a differentiated by the entire ecosystem, by everything that sits on top of it. So now,
[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:16.080]  and we saw this with Palm in a lot of ways, even if you came out with an operating system
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:24.300]  that was as, as elegant and as easy to use, now that that is no longer enough and there
[01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:31.020]  is nothing like, there are very few things in business broadly, I think that are more
[01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:36.720]  challenging than building an ecosystem because there's so many players involved. Like there's
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:40.700]  so much out of your control. And like when I was at windows, I was working on the windows
[01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:44.880]  at app store and, you know, manage a few categories in the app store and trying to get, get people
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:50.660]  on board. And you need, you need the users in place. You need the developers in place.
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:55.020]  You need the right, you need the right capabilities in the system. Like there's, it's this, it's
[01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:59.880]  like, speaking of watches, like this inner interlocking watch, right? But it's not like
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:03.920]  where you can put one piece in and add the next piece. And then they all work together.
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:07.740]  You have to not just put all the pieces in, but they have to all fit in at the same time
[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:12.660]  immediately, right? Like they have to just magically come together and then work. And
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:19.100]  without that it's you, you're forced to like go to shortcuts where it's paying developers,
[01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:24.300]  whether it's, you know, trying to come up with something that's so unique that people
[01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:31.580]  will look over the holes, which, you know, I guess Amazon's trying to do. But it's, it's,
[01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:38.700]  it's fiendishly hard. And this is, this is if Apple is discounted on wall street. And
[01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:42.980]  I think this is going away to your point, but it's, it's on this is that people don't
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:51.420]  like, someone at Microsoft told me that you know, what wall street values is knowing that
[01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:55.880]  you can totally fuck it up and you'll still be in business. Right. And so Microsoft can
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:00.380]  release Vista and they're still going to make tons of money. You know, they can release
[01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:03.400]  windows 8, they're still going to be making tons of money. Their stock is, is higher now
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:08.700]  than it's been in years. Well, that's an interesting point. And this is, this is one of the reasons
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:14.540]  why Amazon has always had such a strong stock is like people view them as being untouchable,
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:19.140]  right? Like their core business, no one's going, no one's, no one's going to threaten
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:25.380]  it. And Apple has always been viewed as, well, one bad break and they're in trouble. And
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:30.300]  that's why the Intendigate was a big deal to, to a lot of people is because they're
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:34.940]  just perception. Well, is this it? Is it, did they finally, did they finally mess up?
[01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:39.660]  And what I think they've missed and what most analysts miss is actually Apple could
[01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:46.140]  release it done and they would be okay because their ecosystem advantage is so significant
[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:54.620]  and it's so hard to, to catch up with that. Yeah, I totally agree. That's a good point.
[01:07:54.620 --> 01:08:01.340]  And I do think that there is like, you know, circling back a couple of minutes, you know,
[01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:08.420]  segments ago that I do think that it's finally starting to dawn on the, you know, investor
[01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:15.100]  world, you know, that Apple is not on the precipice, you know, I, you know, I still
[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:21.380]  think you're going to see a lot of jackassery related to Apple. I still think that you're
[01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:26.300]  going to see, let's just say they, you know, that they ship something that you wear on
[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:32.340]  your wrist and it costs $300 and they sell 5 million of them, which I think is pretty
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:35.880]  reasonable for a new thing. You know, let's just say, I don't know who knows what the
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:40.780]  device does. It's a, a dingus that you wear on your wrist and it sells for $300 and they
[01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:45.780]  sell 5 million of them. And there's going to be people who say multiply 5 million by
[01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:52.060]  $300 and say, well, that's nothing that, that, that averages out to zero for Apple. Therefore,
[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:56.220]  Apple is doomed because they needed to sell 50 million of them, which doesn't happen with
[01:08:56.220 --> 01:09:02.420]  new products. Right. You're still going to see that to some degree, but I think that,
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:07.900]  um, most there's, there's that it's going to be the fringe that, that holds onto that
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:11.020]  rather than the, the conventional wisdom.
[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:17.140]  Yep. No, that's part of the, what we talked about. Like there, there's kind of like this
[01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:22.060]  bubble had to go through the Valley a little bit as far as like perception goes. And, and
[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:25.740]  this is something where, I mean, I know I talked to the, I talked to some people who,
[01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:31.100]  you know, been long close watch of Apple and we're very nervous about cook meeting with
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:35.400]  like Carl, Carla con and stuff like that. And, and really holding that up as a counter
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:39.900]  to what, you know, what jobs would have done. Um, but just tell Carl, I kind of go fuck
[01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:46.460]  them. Right. Exactly. And, but I think this, this was, um, and I, I was sympathetic to
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:50.820]  a degree. I've always been very sympathetic to cook's position that, you know, the stock
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:57.020]  price matters a lot for employee retention. Um, it's kind of been my, my position, but
[01:09:57.020 --> 01:10:02.660]  I think what you're seeing now is, is that kind of effort paying off, right? Like Apple,
[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:08.300]  um, I feel like Apple has gotten a lot more breathing room, um, exactly what you just
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:13.420]  said. And, and that actually is to, I think, cook's credit quite a bit as well.
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:18.140]  Yeah. I think it may be, you know, I don't want to psychoanalyze him because, you know,
[01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:22.180]  I'm not a psychoanalyst and I'm too distant, but that there's something, you know, to be
[01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:27.420]  said that among the ways that cook is a great CEO for Apple right now in way and ways, ways
[01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:33.180]  that he is better than Steve jobs is the ego, right? That obviously, I mean, famously, I
[01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:37.060]  don't think it takes, you know, you don't have to be a psychologist to say that Steve
[01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:44.060]  jobs had a very large ego. Um, you know, and I think while Apple was an upstart, it helped,
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:50.140]  you know, it helped to have a rock star at the helm of the company. And, um, but doing
[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:54.700]  something like going to dinner with Carl Icahn, that, that shows that, that not that Tim Cook
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:59.260]  doesn't have a large ego, but that he's willing to sublimate it. You know, he's willing to
[01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:03.900]  say, look, I, you know, I, I really doubt, I'll bet. I really doubt that he felt like
[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:07.620]  going to dinner with Carl Icahn, but he did it because it was good for the company. You
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:14.320]  know, I think there's a certain extraordinary diligence to, to, to the way cook is, is doing
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:19.940]  that a humility, maybe. Yeah, maybe that's a better word that there's a humility to Tim
[01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:25.320]  cook. Um, you know, whether that's innate, whether that's partly of his Southern upbringing,
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:28.740]  I don't know, but it's, you know, one thing you, nobody would say about Steve jobs is
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:29.740]  that he was humble. Yeah.
[01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:34.940]  Well, and I think, you know, it's one of those things where it's super easy to like, look
[01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:39.900]  back on someone. Right. And you only see the positive sides, but if, if Steve jobs acted
[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:46.360]  like Steve jobs does well, Apple is the most valuable company in the world. Like you would
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:51.840]  like to think that everything is logical and like no one, like it's just a lot easier to
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:55.300]  see them getting themselves in trouble, whether it be with the government, whether it be with
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:12:01.740]  like, with other people, like, um, you know, the, whether it be the app store sort of stuff,
[01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:07.540]  I mean, I don't know what it would be, but that kind of imperiousness, um, where's much
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:11.700]  better to your point when you're, when you're the underdog, as opposed to when you're the
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:16.180]  eight pound gorilla. And, um, you know, when I was, when I w this was something that was
[01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:20.680]  talked about a lot, you know, I was there at, you know, the university was like, wait,
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:30.620]  we have to change, like w by virtue of being huge, we have changed and we can either accept
[01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:36.640]  that and then try to figure out how to preserve what makes Apple Apple. Um, or we can continue
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:40.580]  as we are, but, but that's actually a worst place to be. Cause we're kind of being blind
[01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:45.620]  about the reality, which is the fact that we're this massive company now and, and we
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:51.220]  can't, it can never be the way it was just because things have changed. The world has
[01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:52.220]  changed.
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:57.880]  Yeah. And I think the flip side of that exact same thinking is what I wrote about last month
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:04.100]  with the, the only Apple piece that I killed myself knocking out and, and about the way
[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:09.960]  that, you know, that I, I seemed, it seems very clear to me that Tim Cook has, has brought
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:15.620]  about in the same way that the operations manufacturing has always been very, very well
[01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:21.380]  oiled. Uh, you know, I use that a multi-part watch that all works together, that he's bringing
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:26.880]  that sort of efficiency to Apple's internals in Cupertino with divisions working together
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:31.540]  across, you know, that, that things like just a perfect example of the way that this extension
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:37.380]  system is coming to Yosemite and iOS eight the same time because they're working together.
[01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:42.540]  I WWDC, I spoke to some of the engineers, um, you know, and that Apple just was not
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:47.900]  set up that way. Those were silos previously and it would have been, you know, they even
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:51.740]  called it the one time back to the Mac. It's like, okay, here's a bunch of stuff where
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:56.460]  iOS got ahead of the Mac. Uh, it's already shipped. It shipped last year, you know, in
[01:13:56.460 --> 01:14:01.580]  last year's version of iOS. Now we're bringing it to the Mac. Um, Apple isn't working like
[01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:05.740]  that now. They're developing these things together, you know, and some of them are things
[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:11.900]  that have to be done together. Like, um, oh, I keep forgetting the name of the feature,
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:15.680]  but you know, Hey, there's a webpage in front of me and Safari on my Mac and I want to fling
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:20.840]  it over to my phone. Continuity continuity. Well, that continuity is the, the, the, the
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:25.900]  parent name for all of these features, but there's a specific name for handoff, right?
[01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:30.360]  Handoff is that is continuity is like the umbrella name for all of the features that
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:35.820]  are like this. Um, like answering a phone call on your Mac is part of continuity too.
[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:43.780]  Um, but they're all, you know, it's, you know, and to me it's a realization that it's not
[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:49.300]  just about Tim Cook having a different personality than Steve Jobs. I think it's about Apple
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:54.300]  being big enough that they can do things like this. Like it's not that, let's say Apple
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:59.820]  circa 2003 or 2004 could have been operating like that or should have been operating like
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:04.340]  that under Steve Jobs and that the different, you know, Steve Jobs mercurial nature kept
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:07.660]  them from doing it. They weren't big enough to do it yet and they weren't, you know, they
[01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:12.260]  needed to be more focused. I think it was the right, I think it was the right strategy,
[01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:18.580]  but they've, you know, they've crossed a certain chasm in terms of size where if they didn't
[01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:24.340]  embrace a more collaborative culture, they were missing an enormous opportunity. You
[01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:30.900]  know, that they were leaving an enormous amount of, of wasted potential on the floor because
[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:36.220]  they could be doing so much more in the same amount of time with a more collaborative culture
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:37.420]  than they would otherwise.
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:41.900]  So, here's, here's the question though. So, I mean, I agree with you. I wrote, I wrote
[01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:49.380]  a similar thing, but something that, um, after your piece, um, my, on my, on my podcast exponent
[01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:55.640]  with, with James Allworth, we talked about this is like, yeah, it's, it's, what's so
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:16:01.300]  fascinating. And, um, you talked about Apple growing up, um, and I talked about them, you
[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:06.260]  know, kind of forgetting like the 1997 mindset, you know, that was kind of holding them, holding
[01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:14.060]  them back. And what's, what's so striking about this is the language that we are using.
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:19.100]  Um, and I literally went back and looked up articles and profiles was the exact same language
[01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:23.580]  that was used for a company like Microsoft in the early two thousands, like, Oh, they've
[01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:27.220]  grown up. Like they're going to stop being, you know, bullies that, and they're going
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:32.580]  to be more collaborative. And, and yes, again, I'm not saying Apple's Microsoft at all. Um,
[01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:38.720]  there's lots of important differences, but it's, it, you, you, it, it is worth thinking
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:43.140]  of. I, I'm just curious what you think, right? Steve Jobs said, you know, stay hungry, stay
[01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:47.220]  foolish, but we're talking about them kind of growing up and, and being a little less
[01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:52.420]  foolish. I mean, do you worry at all, um, that maybe there might be something that gets
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:53.420]  lost in this?
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:58.940]  Oh, definitely. I, uh, I mean, worries are wrong word, but, uh, you know, I definitely
[01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:04.900]  file it under things to keep an eye on. Um, because I think it's uncharted territory.
[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:10.260]  I don't think that they're following Microsoft's footsteps. I, you know, and, and some people
[01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:16.540]  have, if there was any criticism of my only Apple piece, it was along the lines of how
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:23.060]  is this different from what, you know, Steve Ballmer taking over from Bill Gates, you know,
[01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:27.620]  and, and the, you know, first couple of, well, actually the whole time he did lead Microsoft
[01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:33.700]  to significantly higher revenue and profits on a consistent basis while driving the, you
[01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:39.620]  know, a ship that with the product categories that we're heading over a cliff, um, strategically
[01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:43.660]  by being a little bit more conservative and, you know, focusing on what we already have
[01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:44.980]  rather than new stuff.
[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:48.900]  Well, I don't, but I think that's not true though, because Microsoft did know that mobile
[01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:52.560]  was next. And so, yeah, but they didn't want to disrupt themselves and they didn't want
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:57.980]  to do mobile in a way that might decrease sales of windows PCs. Right. I think that's
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:00.940]  the fundamental difference. And that's to me is like the thing that I don't worry about
[01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:06.380]  is I don't think if Tim Cook, if somebody came to Tim Cook with an idea that it, I don't
[01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:11.300]  know what it would be, but clearly the, the, the sacred cow at Apple financially is the
[01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:15.980]  iPhone. It's, you know, it's, I think it's over half of profits and half of revenue,
[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:20.380]  even though the iPad is still growing and is huge and the Mac is doing very well. The
[01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:24.720]  iPhone is the thing. If they came up with something that would make people less likely
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:29.940]  to buy iPhones, I don't know what it would be, but if this is say a watch that is so
[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:34.360]  it doesn't, it's not a something that you Bluetooth tethered to your phone, it's just
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:40.700]  a watch and it would make people not buy iPhones and it only costs $300 but it's so awesome
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:44.980]  that it would genuinely drive a rational person to think, I don't even need an iPhone anymore.
[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:49.060]  I don't think Tim Cook would hesitate to do that, to go ahead with it because if somebody
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:54.220]  could do it, it might just, you know, that, that logic of being able to, to, you know,
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:59.540]  rather disrupting yourself than having somebody else disrupt you. It holds true that I think
[01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:03.080]  he has the common sense to think, well, you know, that's where it's going. You know, I
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:08.060]  don't think he would hesitate to, to chase that and pursue that. Yeah. I mean, I think
[01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:15.780]  the, the, the best, the best thing in support of that is probably the iPad, which, um, you
[01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:20.620]  know, is cheaper than a Mac and does cannibalize the Mac. I do think that, you know, I don't
[01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:25.500]  think they care. Right. And it sells for six significantly lower average selling price
[01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:30.260]  than even, you know, the cheapest Mac book air, let alone the average selling price of,
[01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:35.560]  of a regular Mac book. Right. You know, it's probably half the price at least of average
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:40.420]  selling price. And I don't think Apple regrets it at one bit. Yeah. Well, they've increased
[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:44.960]  increased volume. Right. Um, right. I think the, the, the only thing, the only, the only
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:49.260]  like hesitation I have is people always point to like, Oh, the, the iPhone replaced the
[01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:53.220]  iPod. Well, the problem is they're making more money on iPhones and they were like on
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:56.620]  one iPhone than they do on one iPod. So it's not a great example. That's why I like the
[01:19:56.620 --> 01:20:02.540]  iPad one, but it's, it, I mean, it is interesting. I think I do, I, the other reason I think
[01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:09.860]  that Apple is not Microsoft is, um, you know, my Microsoft's strengths and advantages were
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:16.220]  not in the product. Right. I mean, they, they, Microsoft has always been a marketing company
[01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:21.180]  whereby marketing, I mean, not advertising, but they've, they've always done very, a very
[01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:25.080]  good job of understanding their customer's needs and then building exactly what, what
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:29.220]  they want. Right. And that's why they have all the backwards compatibility stuff and
[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:35.380]  all the, like all multiple, all the driver issues and stuff. All that is because it's
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:40.660]  everything they do has been, they've really have gone all bent over backwards to meet
[01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:46.780]  people's needs. Right. Um, but that didn't, doesn't work so well when it comes to consumer
[01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:51.140]  products where you can't ask every consumer what they want. You have to build like the
[01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:56.820]  right profit, the right product and make them want it. Um, I, I've always said that one
[01:20:56.820 --> 01:21:04.460]  of the things I think is underestimated is the importance of the exact order of your
[01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:08.540]  priorities. Like if you, even if you only care as an institution or even a person about
[01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:12.820]  three things, it really makes a difference which one's number one and which one's number
[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:17.060]  two. Cause there always come a decision where you have to choose, right? Like all I really
[01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:21.740]  care about in life is, you know, or I don't know how to say personally, but let's say
[01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:28.100]  Apple, I still think that their number one priority is creating great products and great
[01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:35.060]  experiences for the users. And maybe number two is doing it at a profit because the profits
[01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:40.920]  sustain everything and you know, but it makes a huge difference that one is in front of
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:45.780]  two and that all sorts of things fall out from that, especially in the long run.
[01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:52.420]  Because it's not that Microsoft doesn't care about experience. I just don't think that
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:56.900]  they place it quite as high in the priority list institutionally as Apple. And then there's
[01:21:56.900 --> 01:22:00.420]  in the long run, there's been profound differences because of that.
[01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:04.820]  Well, and there's different, there's different kinds of experiences, right? To satisfy a
[01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:14.300]  a business's needs. Um, you, you often prioritize things other than like the, the end user experience
[01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:18.580]  of actually using the product, right? It's a, because the buyer is different than the
[01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:25.700]  user. And so you prioritize what the buyer values. Um, and yeah, it, and I think that's
[01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:30.520]  the real kind of big difference between the consumer market and the, and the business
[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:38.740]  market is, is the end user is the, is the buyer and that, yeah, that makes Apple's strategy
[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:45.380]  much more, much better. Apple's priorities, a much better match for the consumer market.
[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:51.380]  Here's another example. I'll give you an example that I think is very clear and that this,
[01:22:51.380 --> 01:23:02.940]  this month's Android Wear, um, watches, uh, show Google and OEMs like LG and Samsung plays
[01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:06.420]  a much higher, well, maybe not much, it's just a different order, but they place a higher
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:14.220]  priority on being first to market than Apple does. No doubt in my mind and it's watches
[01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:20.040]  to me are proof of it, that they're clearly rushed to their clunky. There's a lot of you
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:25.220]  read the reviews. There's a lot of things that just are half baked. Um, you know, Joanna
[01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:29.720]  Stern had a, my favorite review of them in, uh, the wall street journal, I guess it was
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:35.740]  last week, but um, great review. But right now notifications are all or nothing. You
[01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:40.020]  either say all of your notifications from your phone, go to your watch or none of them
[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:44.320]  do, at least on an app by app basis. So it's like you either have, if you want a notifications
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.900]  for incoming email on your phone, then every time you get an email, your wrist is going
[01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:52.220]  to buzz, which is maddening at least for some people like Joanna. And it is for me cause
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:57.000]  I've tried it with the pebble. Um, but you might want something like, look, just these
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:03.500]  two people, my wife and my boss, you know, when they email me, I want, or, or like an
[01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:07.940]  apple terms, the VIP list, right? If my, just, there's nothing like that. And of course it's
[01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:12.340]  going to come eventually, but I mean, that just seems like a, why would you buy that?
[01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:18.140]  And then an even better example, the Moto three 60, which is to me, it's the most controversial
[01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:24.900]  product I can remember in, in years because I, so many people on the Android side are
[01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:30.020]  saying that now here's a beautiful thing and it's like, no, it's not, it's, it is not a
[01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:36.500]  beautiful thing. It's, it is better looking than the other two clunkers so far from LG
[01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:41.740]  and Samsung, that's for sure. But it is not a beautiful thing. It, and, and that stupid
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:47.620]  bar at the bottom of, of the screen. Oh, it's awful. It's awful. Apple wouldn't ship that
[01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:51.860]  in a million years. And the only reason Motorola is shipping it is because it's rushed to market.
[01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:55.860]  Everything's relative, right? Right. Yeah. It looks great compared to the LG, but compared
[01:24:55.860 --> 01:25:00.420]  to my watch, it's clearly Motorola and the designers and the team that built that Moto
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:06.500]  three 60 place a higher priority on design than, than the, the idiots at LG and Samsung
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:12.220]  who made their watches. And even if they, if they value design as much as Apple, they
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:17.300]  also have this higher priority of wanting to ship it as soon as possible. And clearly
[01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:21.360]  I guess in anticipation of Apple coming out with something, shipping it before Apple does.
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:25.020]  And so they were willing to compromise and ship this thing with a black bar at the bottom
[01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:28.820]  of the circle, which is ridiculous. So, so here's, here's, what's interesting is you
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:31.460]  know, cause the counter would be, Oh, that's okay. We're going to iterate. We want to learn
[01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:37.380]  from the market. But in the meantime, they're charging people $225 for these things. Well,
[01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:42.900]  it's not just that though, because think about it. If you, if you're actually, you realize
[01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:52.260]  that you only want notifications for one to two people. Do you then need a screen? Well,
[01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:54.900]  that's a good question. Let's come back to that. Let me thank our third sponsor and then
[01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:58.420]  we'll, we'll do one more segment on the show and we'll start with, with that, with the
[01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:05.220]  watches. I want to thank another long time friend of the show, our good friends at Igloo,
[01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:14.020]  the intranet you'll actually like. I was listening to ATP podcasts this week and I'm just going
[01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:18.220]  to steal the line from Marco, which is that it's always a good, if there's ever anything
[01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:21.300]  in your life that's annoying, it's a great idea for new products in general. If you can
[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:25.520]  find something where all of your options are annoying and you can think of a way to build
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:29.420]  a version that's not annoying and doesn't suck, that's generally a good idea. Well,
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:35.580]  that's what Igloo has done with intranets. Intranets suck. So Igloo has attacked the
[01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:42.740]  problem and built an intranet product that doesn't suck. They have a new update that's
[01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:46.260]  coming soon. We've talked about it on the show before. It's called Unicorn and it has
[01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:51.780]  a ton of new features, but the best part of it is integrated task management that will
[01:26:51.780 --> 01:26:56.760]  change the way you stay on track with work. Igloo tasks can be assigned in different ways
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:01.540]  depending on the work you're doing. One of the coolest ways to use tasks is creating
[01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:06.100]  them directly on your content. Why do you need this? Well, you're requesting updates
[01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:11.100]  on a graphic or a text correction on a Word document. You can create these tasks right
[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:15.580]  on your content so your team can stay up to date with what has to be done next to update
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:21.020]  the graphic or edit the text. When you're viewing content, even if it's a blog entry,
[01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:26.920]  an event, a forum topic inside your Igloo, these tasks are all right there, informing
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:31.520]  everyone of all the tasks that have been completed and what needs additional work. You can assign
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:36.520]  tasks to yourself, to teammates. You can comment on the tasks and you can keep all the changes
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:43.160]  in one place. Huge feature, I think it's obviously turned Igloo into more than just an intranet.
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:48.920]  It's more of a project management platform for your small teams. Really great stuff.
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:54.380]  It's a free update for all Igloo customers. It's coming this summer. You can learn more
[01:27:54.380 --> 01:28:01.580]  about it. Here's where you go, igloosoftware.com slash the talk show. They've got all sorts
[01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:06.060]  of great stuff too. I always throw this out there. It's free for up to 10 people, not
[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:12.640]  free for like a month, just free period for up to 10 people. No obligation. If you have
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:19.640]  a team of people working together, go check them out, igloosoftware.com slash the talk
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:27.040]  show. That's a great point. I think bottom line is I think you were saying about do you
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:30.280]  need, if you only want notifications for one or two people, do you need a screen on your
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:34.200]  wrist? To me, the answer is no. I don't think so.
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:36.360]  Dave Asprey Just to, before we actually get into that,
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:40.900]  and I'd actually love your take because as we've established back and forth, your product
[01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:46.400]  sense is much better than mine. What's interesting though is about these guys rushing to market
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:52.560]  is they can say that, oh, we're just iterating, but now they're locked into this paradigm.
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:29:02.560]  If it turns out that the best sort of secondary device needs only to be screenless, for example,
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:08.720]  now they're like, it's like they've sailed up a dead end. Now it's not just that they
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:13.660]  need to iterate. They actually need to backtrack and they've actually put themselves more
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:19.160]  behind than they might have been otherwise. That's what would make something like that
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:22.680]  particularly interesting if they actually were pursuing the wrong paradigm to start
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:24.360]  out with. I'm not saying they are. It's just
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.040]  Dave I don't know, but I can't help but think
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:31.960]  that they are. Joanna Stern's review just went, just explicitly called it, what I think
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:37.780]  it looks like is they've taken modern smartphones and shrunk them to two inches and put them
[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:39.920]  on a wristband and now they go on your wrist.
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:41.640]  Dave We saw that worked with mobile, right? That's
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:47.160]  what Microsoft did, taking this conversation full circle. They literally had a start button.
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:50.600]  Dave That's true, in the lower left, lower left.
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:51.600]  Right.
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:54.720]  Dave I think they might have had it on the upper
[01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:56.440]  left just to switch it up a little bit.
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:58.680]  Dave Oh, maybe they did. But it was the same thing
[01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:02.720]  though. You tap the start button and get a start menu and go from there.
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:07.200]  Dave Right. I really do think their mobile shortcomings
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:11.160]  were first and foremost because they just made a bad product. They made a bad product
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:17.520]  because they couldn't break out of desktop thinking. To me, this is by far the biggest
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:23.840]  criticism of Android Wear. I have a few criticisms, but the biggest one is it's Windows Mobile
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:32.220]  2.0. It's taking a smartphone and cramming it onto your wrist. Anytime you're shifting
[01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:38.900]  a paradigm or shifting a device, tech history isn't that old, but I think we can say pretty
[01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:47.860]  confidently that you have to change everything. They haven't done that. For that reason alone,
[01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:50.280]  plus some other reasons, I'm very skeptical.
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:53.240]  Dave I've gotten some emails, and I love them.
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:58.160]  I do. I know that my audience, that human nature
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:03.480]  is such that, and modern media is such that whether it's national politics or whether
[01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:09.720]  it's tech, that people enjoy reading the things that come from the people who already think
[01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:14.280]  the way they think. I love the people who are like big Android fans who read Daring
[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:22.640]  Fireball. Their feedback to me, they seldom change my mind, but I always consider it.
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:26.460]  To me, it's a great perspective. I've already gotten some emails from people who were at
[01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:35.000]  IO and have one of these Wear watches already, and they say that they like it. I've probably
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.480]  gotten more such emails than I've ever gotten from people who tell me that glass is actually
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:40.480]  for good.
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:44.120]  Dave Well, you're talking about relativity and
[01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:45.120]  sending little bars.
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:49.040]  Dave Basically, it's saying, you know what? I think
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:51.640]  it's great. I love having my notifications on my wrist.
[01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:52.640]  Dave People love Windows Mobile.
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:56.480]  Dave Right. Yeah. I don't dispute that there are
[01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:00.760]  some number of people who do like getting their notifications on their wrist and just
[01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:06.520]  looking at it. My big thing with the Pebble that I just thought was the deal breaker was
[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:13.720]  that, okay, I tried boring the Pebble, and God bless them. I love their gumption, but
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:20.080]  you get a notification, and if it was something you had to act on, you had to take your phone
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:27.440]  out, right? The one time I was wearing a Pebble, the one time I wore it for a couple of weeks,
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:32.620]  that it was actually useful as I was driving my car and I was going to pick up my son at
[01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:37.940]  school and I got a text from my wife. I forget what it was said, but it was actually useful
[01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:44.400]  for me to get the text, but I needed to text her back. I do this. I'm literally like a
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:49.420]  fanatic about it. I will not use my phone while I'm driving a car. I had to pull over
[01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:53.760]  and park the car for a second and then text her.
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:58.520]  It wasn't that much better than just feeling the phone vibrate and waiting until I got
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:03.620]  to the school and take the phone out and see the text. It wasn't an emergency. It was not
[01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:08.380]  an emergency thing. It was just, but I had to write her back. The thing that Wear has
[01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:13.720]  is they have the talk so that if you do get a text and your hands are free, you can speak
[01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:18.800]  your reply to the thing. So there is that, and that's a huge step over Pebble.
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:23.320]  But to me, it's, it is not an inconvenience to me. It's never felt like a burden to me
[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:30.600]  to take my phone out when I feel a buzz. Well, I mean, I think they've solved a problem that
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:33.380]  I don't think many people have, and I can't tell you how many people have told me over
[01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:37.740]  the years, all this time that watches have been rumored as the next area of innovation
[01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:41.520]  and text, I can't even count the number of emails and tweets I've gotten from people
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:47.160]  who say, uh, I used to wear a watch, wear a watch when I was in college, whatever, uh,
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:50.640]  I haven't won a watch since I started carrying a cell phone. I want to know the time. I just
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:51.640]  take my phone out.
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:56.120]  So it was interesting is, is I do think where it makes a big difference actually is for
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:34:01.200]  women. Um, especially if they carry their phone in their bags. Like my, I mean, just
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:07.200]  that's a very good point, right? That it's, it's harder to find a phone in a bag than
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:12.080]  it is to find a phone in your front pocket. Yep. And actually in Asia, most men carry
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:16.380]  bags as well. Like that's actually another reason why the bigger phones are, are a thing.
[01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:21.000]  And so we've, they've made these watches that are so appealing to women. No, but that's
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:27.720]  the point is like, so actually probably the best market is women. And these are, yeah,
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:32.480]  the video, like our list, the listeners have to watch the Joanna Stern video, right? Like
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:36.840]  I'll put it in the show. Yeah. Don't get, we won't give it away. Just it's, it's, it's,
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:42.360]  it's really great. Which addresses that point specifically. Right. But anyway, the one thing
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:47.160]  that watches have been best at ever since they were invented is telling time. That's
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:50.880]  the one thing everybody I think would agree is the one thing that, you know, the definition
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:56.600]  of a watch, everything else, every other complication on a watch is, isn't it like a secondary feature.
[01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:03.800]  Primary purpose is to find out what time it is. Uh, and I think for most people, the phone
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:09.240]  has proven to be a good enough solution and that the, you know, I can't tell you how many
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:13.300]  people have told me that, that the one thing watches specialize in people are like, I always
[01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:18.720]  have my cell phone in my pocket. I don't wear a watch anymore, let alone, let alone everything
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:25.400]  else. Like people who might be texting you pictures and longer texts and you know, um,
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:29.840]  even on screenshots, you know, I don't know, there's just so many, so many bizarre compromises
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:34.240]  in the design of this where, and the pebbles the same way where it shows so few characters
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:40.880]  because you know, it's a tiny little, you know, 1.6 inch display and you can't just
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:45.640]  can't show it. Even like a text message is hard to fit on at once. Yeah, I think, yeah,
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:49.640]  this is like, there's one thing watches are better at and even then people aren't willing
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:54.680]  to wear them, right? Why would they wear them for something that it's worse at? And it's,
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:59.640]  you know, and again, repeating myself, everybody's made this point, but it's also very decidedly
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:06.560]  um, a generational thing where, you know, the younger you are, the less like you in
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:10.880]  and the less like you are to have ever worn a watch. And therefore, why would I do that?
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:13.560]  Why would I buy a thing that just tells me the time? I always know the time I've got
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:19.760]  my phone with me. So I, I increasingly feel, um, again, I don't have a great product sense,
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:26.280]  but just kind of thinking through this stuff through is, um, one, I, I think there's going
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:31.360]  to be a range. I don't think there is a AI watch or an AI watch. There's going to be
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:35.440]  a whole bunch of devices. There might be rings, there might be watches, there might be clips.
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:40.360]  There might be like, it literally might be like 10 different things actually. Um, and
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:45.400]  two, I think most of them won't have screens. Maybe there will be one or two that do, but
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:50.940]  um, I don't know that that's going to take. Yeah, I don't know. I especially screens as
[01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:55.900]  we know them, which are enormous energy hogs and which is the reason why your gear watch
[01:36:55.900 --> 01:37:02.020]  has to, or Android wear watch has to be charged daily. Um, and I know, I think I said this
[01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:06.080]  last week when whiskers was on the show, but I just think people are, I think so many tech
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:14.080]  people are vastly, vastly overestimating what an enormous burden is to carry even a single
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:19.000]  device that needs charging daily. And we've all made this decision. We all decided that
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:24.440]  having these, you know, modern cell phones is important enough, um, to do it, but it's
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:28.020]  an enormous burden. And every time you go to the airport and you see people sitting
[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:33.340]  grown men in suits sitting on the floor so they can be near a electrical socket, that's
[01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:38.840]  for one device, right? Asking people to have a second device that you need to charge on
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:45.600]  a daily basis and one which requires a proprietary weirdo charger thing that you have to somehow
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:53.800]  carry around with you is, um, I'm not saying it's impossible. You know, clearly the, the
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:57.640]  cell phone river, if, if, if it's possible to get everybody to carry one device that
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:02.920]  needs charging daily, um, it's possible to make them have two, but don't underestimate
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:06.680]  just how crazy it is that we've convinced everybody to carry even one device that needs
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:10.380]  charging. Yeah, I don't think so. I mean, cause you just, you just said it exactly right.
[01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:15.060]  If that one device can do what that other device. Yeah, exactly. If show notifications
[01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:20.380]  like you reply to them, you know, like we were convincing me even more, like I really
[01:38:20.380 --> 01:38:25.080]  don't think there's going to be a screen because like, uh, you know, there's a, you think about
[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:28.040]  a few ways, like, well one, just imagine the showmanship, right? It's going to be like
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:33.580]  the whole, like the iPhone has no buttons while the iWatch has no screen. Um, but I
[01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:37.540]  think you have to think about it. Like you think back to the iPod, like what, what made
[01:38:37.540 --> 01:38:44.860]  the iPod so transformative? It was that it removed features from music players, right?
[01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:48.880]  There were music players on the, on the market, but they had all these fiddly things to, to
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:52.300]  change controls. I mean, yes, part of it was the thousand songs in the pocket and the,
[01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:58.040]  and the, and the design, but a big part of it was iTunes. It was that all this complex
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:04.380]  management stuff was removed from the device and put on a much more suitable device and,
[01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:08.180]  and they using it, using it felt like going downhill, not uphill. Right? Exactly. Like
[01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:12.980]  in all it did was, was, was like what only it could do, which was play music on the go
[01:39:12.980 --> 01:39:17.620]  and actually managing playlists and all that sort of stuff you did, you did on your computer.
[01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:23.140]  And I, I, and over time that changed. Like now my, my phone has never been connected
[01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:28.460]  to my computer. Right. But that took like a de, over a decade. Right. I think, I think
[01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:34.220]  watches or these wearables are going to start the same way. Like they, their function will
[01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:38.700]  be something that only they can do that a watch cannot do. It's probably, some is going
[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:42.380]  to be the sensor stuff. Some is going to be, I think that I do think there'll be a notification
[01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:46.940]  thing, but it will be the like only your favorites. Like you can do favorites on your phone. Like
[01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:52.220]  those will be the only ones. And people will bitch and moan about how limited it is, but,
[01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:56.180]  but, and then all the other stuff will be on the phone. There won't, I don't think there
[01:39:56.180 --> 01:40:02.220]  will be, there'll be minimal, if any duplication between what one does and what the other does.
[01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:07.820]  And on the flip side, I think Apple is going to try to make these not tech devices that
[01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:14.080]  look good, but fashion accessories that happen to have electronic functions. Right. You've
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:17.820]  got to work backwards. And it's a, you know, I'll paraphrase it, but it's a Steve Jobs
[01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:24.380]  quote that you've got to work backwards from the experience, what it is you want to do
[01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:29.620]  to the technology and not the other way around. And to me, these Android Wear devices are
[01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:35.620]  exactly the opposite. It's starting with, and Google even said this explicitly on stage
[01:40:35.620 --> 01:40:41.220]  at IO, it's now possible to build a smartphone like device that fits on your wrist. And it's
[01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:49.260]  true that that wasn't possible before. That it's, it's, you know, great increases in miniaturization,
[01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:54.620]  great increases in, you know, you know, just the ability to power, to power this little
[01:40:54.620 --> 01:41:00.860]  tiny screens even for a day does require new technology. And Bluetooth LTE is new technology
[01:41:00.860 --> 01:41:05.140]  so that you can actually maintain a tethered connection. Even if, you know, one day's battery
[01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:09.980]  life is crappy, I think for a watch, but it says something that you can keep a Bluetooth
[01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:15.700]  and all the reviews indicate that you do get a full day out of the thing. That's new technology,
[01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:20.620]  but it's all working backwards from we can do this. So let to do it. And here it is instead
[01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:24.100]  of starting with what would actually be a good experience for a thing you wear on your
[01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:25.940]  wrist and what would look good.
[01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:31.660]  No, exactly. I do. I have one more question for you that I'm actually curious your take
[01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:37.540]  on. So that's my, we just nailed my big Christmas Android Wear and where I'm, I don't think
[01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:43.140]  like, I think it's, it's, it's a misstep. I think it's Windows mobile. Um, my other
[01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:48.660]  question is, is what you think about Google now?
[01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:56.420]  I, you know, I, I think it's, I wrote just a little thing about it. Um, when I linked
[01:41:56.420 --> 01:42:02.660]  to Joanna Stern's review today, um, but I do think that's where there's the most potential
[01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:11.980]  in, um, Android or Google based wearables is that Google to me, I think has best of
[01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:19.380]  breed speech, understanding, speaking, it's amazing. It works every single time. Yeah.
[01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:23.540]  And I think Siri has gotten better. I really do. I use it all the time walking, walking
[01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:27.980]  around the city while texting. I'll do use the speech and, and I serious the umbrella
[01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:32.420]  term, not Siri, the intelligent agent, but Siri, the hit the microphone next to the space
[01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:38.140]  bar to dictate a text. Um, it's gotten better. It's gotten more accurate and it has gotten
[01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:41.660]  the latencies improved and it works better over cellular, but it still is not as good
[01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:46.100]  as Google's. And that's because I think Google's is, isn't standing still on that either. Right.
[01:42:46.100 --> 01:42:50.600]  Best of breed. Google's best best of breed for speaking to a device and understanding
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:55.700]  it quickly. Uh, and I think there's a lot of potential there for wearables. Um, but
[01:42:55.700 --> 01:43:00.700]  my problem is I don't buy into the, let Google know everything about me. I don't use Google
[01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:05.340]  there. I don't want Google, I don't want Google knowing my location. I'm, I'm genuinely creeped
[01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:09.540]  out by all of that. What if you weren't creeped out though? Like do you think that's something
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:16.220]  that you would find useful? I mean the reason, the reason I ask is, is to me, um, I feel
[01:43:16.220 --> 01:43:23.160]  this is a, there's a really interesting, uh, interview with, um, uh, Vinod Khosla of Khosla
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:28.340]  Ventures and, and Larry Page and Sergey Brin, uh, earlier this week. And, and they talk
[01:43:28.340 --> 01:43:34.820]  about this a bit. Um, and like I feel there's just a fundamentally different view of computing,
[01:43:34.820 --> 01:43:40.160]  um, between Google and Apple. And it really is personified right now more than anything
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:43.980]  by Siri versus Google now. Yeah, I think that's a good point. And I think I know where you're
[01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:48.620]  going with that. And part of it is I've been reading these reviews of the, the where devices
[01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:52.660]  and a lot of what you see on them isn't what you've asked for. It's what Google thinks
[01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:58.440]  you want to see. Right. And like you don't, you don't say, show me my flight. It, it,
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:02.240]  you've put your flight in your calendar and at a certain point Google says, Hey, you've
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:07.540]  got a, you've got a 1pm flight and it's 1030 in the morning and it's going to take you
[01:44:07.540 --> 01:44:12.260]  at least 45 minutes to get there. And, and it, it comes up, you didn't ask for it. It
[01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:16.120]  doesn't. And, and I've seen a couple of reviews mentioned weather is like that. Like you'll
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:19.960]  get like a weather thing and once you dismiss it, you can't make it come back. There's no
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:23.520]  way to say, show me that weather card I just dismissed. They, they show you the weather
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:27.300]  when they think you'd know, want to know about the weather. And that, I think I would find
[01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:32.660]  that mad. Well, yeah, I mean, one thing that was interesting that, no, exactly. It's, it's
[01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:39.900]  they, their view is anticipating your needs and like taking care of them for you. And
[01:44:39.900 --> 01:44:45.020]  it's, it really is a, um, uh, you know, Larry Page said like, that's why the I'm feeling
[01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:49.940]  lucky button was there. Cause I'm feeling lucky is what Google that's Google's ideal
[01:44:49.940 --> 01:44:54.580]  vision of Google search is that actually everyone always can hit. I feel lucky because it will
[01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:59.780]  always serve exactly the right result. And, but their vision now is even past that. It's
[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:03.380]  like, you don't even have to type something in the box. Like they will know what you want
[01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:10.780]  and give it to you. And it's like, it really is. Um, uh, you know, Benedict Evans, uh,
[01:45:10.780 --> 01:45:15.260]  we mentioned earlier, posted a tweet during Google IO of saying, Google, he posted a picture
[01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:20.260]  of the scene from, um, uh, Wally, where the fat people, you know, everyone's fat and sitting
[01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:24.100]  in chairs and all their needs are being addressed. He's like, Oh, Google and Apple are racing
[01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:29.740]  here. And, and I wrote in a piece, I'm like, I actually, I think Google is going there,
[01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:35.940]  but I think Apple is very explicitly not going there. Um, and it goes back to, you know,
[01:45:35.940 --> 01:45:42.780]  Steve jobs saying the computer is a bicycle, right? A bicycle is still subject to a human's
[01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:49.180]  direction and a human's propulsion. It just, it just enhances that. Um, it's not, it's
[01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:54.500]  not a self-driving car, like taking you where you want to go. And, uh, and you see that
[01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:59.600]  with Siri, Siri doesn't anticipate your needs. It only responds to questions. And I don't
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:05.520]  think that's a technical limitation. I think it's a philosophical one. And, and to me,
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:09.420]  I think that's something that, you know, is very, is really a question of who's going
[01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:14.580]  to own the future because if, if Google's right, they will own the future because they're
[01:46:14.580 --> 01:46:23.320]  so far ahead of everyone. Um, but if, if, if it's, if computers stay a tool, then Apple
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:28.420]  and their, their user, their user experience and all that sort of stuff, um, will continue
[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:29.780]  to differentiate them.
[01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:36.020]  Yeah. Maybe it's not either or either, you know, maybe it's, you know, it's a bifurcation
[01:46:36.020 --> 01:46:41.080]  and it, you know, one, one group of, depending on your personality is drawn to one side and
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:45.920]  one's drawn to another. And it comes back to, I think what, what, um, Benedict Evans
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:53.660]  had written this week about that, that ever since 2007 iOS and Android have been converging
[01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:57.960]  and that they've been signed a picking up the same feet, you know, Google picked up
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:03.580]  dry drag from the top for notifications first. And then Andrew Apple picked it up and Android
[01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:07.060]  picked up a whole bunch of features from that iOS. It was way ahead of them on, you know,
[01:47:07.060 --> 01:47:10.500]  as the years went on. But then eventually they picked up all, both of them got all the
[01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:15.340]  low hanging fruit. And with this year's iOS aid and Android L announcements, now you're
[01:47:15.340 --> 01:47:18.580]  seeing them go in different directions. And I think you're, you're talking about the same
[01:47:18.580 --> 01:47:24.660]  sort of thing I think is, you know, and I, you know, maybe they're both sustainable.
[01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:27.940]  Maybe it's not, you know, but that they appeal to very different people. I don't know. I
[01:47:27.940 --> 01:47:32.100]  think one of the most telling things I've, I've read about Android Wear, I haven't written
[01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:41.020]  about it yet, but it was Ron Amadeus review in Ars Technica of Android Wear, just the
[01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:45.660]  software, which when I first started reading it, I thought I expected to roll my eyes cause
[01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:53.540]  I thought it was a weird idea to review the software in the abstract as opposed to the
[01:47:53.540 --> 01:48:00.900]  actual experience of the watches it on the actual devices. But you know, to their credit,
[01:48:00.900 --> 01:48:06.740]  ours did have reviews of the watches, but, and Ron's review of just Android Wear was
[01:48:06.740 --> 01:48:10.020]  interesting cause it just sort of focused on the philosophy of it. And he, you know,
[01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:15.020]  it emphasized these things that a lot of what you see on it is what Google thinks you want
[01:48:15.020 --> 01:48:19.160]  to see. And that, you know, and he mentioned specifically with the weather that it was
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:23.780]  frustrating that you couldn't just bring it back up. And that to me would be maddening,
[01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:31.260]  but I think it's also very telling about the, the philosophy behind it. And I think you're
[01:48:31.260 --> 01:48:38.940]  exactly right that it is, yeah, philosophical differences is that, that exactly. And I saw
[01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:42.540]  the interview, I didn't read the whole thing, but I saw the interview with, where was that
[01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:47.420]  did I, I should probably link that up to the interview with Sergey. And I think that the
[01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:50.580]  gist of it was that he was saying that eventually the algorithms are going to be smarter than
[01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:51.580]  us.
[01:48:51.580 --> 01:48:55.740]  Right. I mean, it really, it's interesting too. And I think this is, this is part of
[01:48:55.740 --> 01:49:02.860]  the thing why Google, you know, is, tends to have us to hold on, kind of geeks in general
[01:49:02.860 --> 01:49:07.960]  is like, it's always kind of been, been a very geeky domain. The, you know, like geeks
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:12.380]  aren't afraid of AI. They're not afraid of robots, right? Like they're, they're intrigued
[01:49:12.380 --> 01:49:17.080]  by them. They're kind of drawn to them like moths to a flame. Right. And Google has always
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:22.740]  been very much in that sort of vibe. And, but what's really interesting and is going
[01:49:22.740 --> 01:49:27.860]  to be, it's, you see it starting to play out now, it's about even more is as, you know,
[01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:32.060]  tech has kind of spent the last 30 years eating itself, right? We, we, we disrupt each other
[01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:36.740]  and all that sort of stuff. But now as it's touching every part of society, you're getting
[01:49:36.740 --> 01:49:42.360]  like people who don't think about this, who, who really do see computers as tools, right?
[01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:47.300]  They help them get stuff done. Now they're encountering this, they're kind of stuff like
[01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:52.100]  Facebook and the testing and all that, which to most geeks, it's AB testing, but to someone
[01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:57.060]  else is like, what the hell is going on here? Right. And I think you're going to, it's going
[01:49:57.060 --> 01:50:01.420]  to be really interesting to see as this kind of collision happens with society as a whole
[01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:07.140]  and they start waking up to like, to this kind of like, what, what is almost we're used
[01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:16.060]  to. I suspect that actually that I, I obviously think it's going to play out more in the computers
[01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:21.620]  as tools. I think it's how most people view them and want them to operate. But maybe Google's
[01:50:21.620 --> 01:50:25.260]  right and people do want, you know, personal assistance.
[01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:33.580]  Right. And that algorithms can deliver a satisfying superior or superior, right? I mean, that's
[01:50:33.580 --> 01:50:37.260]  the whole, I mean, it's not even new. It's not, it's certainly not a new direction for
[01:50:37.260 --> 01:50:43.900]  Google. It's, it's new terrain in the same direction, you know, like Google news. That's
[01:50:43.900 --> 01:50:47.420]  the whole point between Google news is that you could, which, you know, I don't think
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:51.900]  it's a major project product for them anymore, but the basic idea behind it, that Google
[01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:57.740]  could algorithmically predict the most important news and the news, I guess, personalized that,
[01:50:57.740 --> 01:51:02.540]  you know, would be most appealing to you as opposed to the editors of the New York times
[01:51:02.540 --> 01:51:08.940]  or you know, the verge for technology or whatever.
[01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:14.840]  What's so interesting though is, is Google's big product still is today's search and search
[01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:18.700]  is actually much more, if we're going to call this divide like an Apple Google divide, it's
[01:51:18.700 --> 01:51:22.900]  much more on the Apple side of things like you it's, it's directed, you go there and
[01:51:22.900 --> 01:51:28.100]  you put in a word and you click the button or you press the one Google product that Steve
[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:32.900]  Jobs has adamantly said is a great product. Exactly. And it's, and it's funny because
[01:51:32.900 --> 01:51:40.060]  what Google is pushing for is, is actually different than what their big successful product
[01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:42.980]  is. Yeah. Yeah. That's a great point. I agree
[01:51:42.980 --> 01:51:47.660]  with that. Briefly, cause I don't want to go past the two hour mark, but one last thing
[01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:53.880]  I wanted to speak to you about while I had you and I'd loathe it if I didn't is that
[01:51:53.880 --> 01:52:04.740]  just yesterday it broke that, um, that Apple has hired, um, yeah, the sales director, sales
[01:52:04.740 --> 01:52:10.900]  executive from Tag Heuer of a high end luxury watch brand, uh, which is part of, it's not
[01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:16.100]  like an independent brand. It's part of LVMH, which is Louis Vuitton. What's the M H stand
[01:52:16.100 --> 01:52:21.820]  for? Uh, I always get the M wrong cause H is Hennessy. It's a Mo I think it's like the
[01:52:21.820 --> 01:52:26.220]  champagne brand or something, isn't it? Well, it's a wrong every single time. Oh, I know
[01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:30.540]  the shame. All right. So, but anyway, French conglomerate that owns Louis Vuitton, Hennessy.
[01:52:30.540 --> 01:52:36.860]  Um, you know, it, I true conglomerate cause it's part of their Moet, Moet with a little
[01:52:36.860 --> 01:52:40.820]  with omelet on it. Right. So, you know, I think it's fair to say that any company that
[01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:47.860]  owns versus both Louis Vuitton and the champagne and, and uh, cognac brand, uh, is a conglomerate.
[01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:57.180]  But obviously there's a certain, uh, you know, luxury, it's quality, it's, you know, branding.
[01:52:57.180 --> 01:53:02.620]  Uh, they've hired a sales executive from, from Tag Heuer and that joins, uh, Paul Deneve
[01:53:02.620 --> 01:53:12.620]  who came from Eve St. Lawrence and most famously Angela Arenz, uh, Burberry. And I wrote about
[01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:18.060]  this and, and said that I would include Jimmy Yovine and Dr. Dre in that group. And, and
[01:53:18.060 --> 01:53:21.900]  I, that's all I said last night and I got a lot of stuff that I got beats is in a luxury
[01:53:21.900 --> 01:53:27.260]  brand and I realized luxury is the wrong word. And this is, this is the clarifying thing
[01:53:27.260 --> 01:53:32.140]  I added today is that I, I include Yovine and Dr. Dre because I don't think beats is
[01:53:32.140 --> 01:53:36.020]  a luxury brand, but I don't think luxury is the right word to explain these hires. It's
[01:53:36.020 --> 01:53:40.340]  about some kind of like circling around taste style branding.
[01:53:40.340 --> 01:53:44.460]  Yeah, see beats is a luxury brand though. It's a, it's a luxury brand. The same way
[01:53:44.460 --> 01:53:48.740]  Apple is a luxury brand. Right? Well, and then I even said, I, here's where I think
[01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:51.900]  when people say I'm worried about this, I'm worried about the direction Apple's going
[01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:57.920]  is think about this. The iPhone is nothing like virtue where you buy like a $6,000 symbion
[01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:04.020]  phone and it's got leather and jewels on it. Uh, and beats isn't like virtue either, right?
[01:54:04.020 --> 01:54:07.860]  Because I never see people walking down the street with virtue phones, but every single
[01:54:07.860 --> 01:54:11.860]  day in Philadelphia, I see people where, especially, you know, it's certainly come to my attention
[01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:15.940]  since Apple bought them. I see them every day. I see people wearing beats every single
[01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:21.100]  day in Philadelphia. And virtue is not like that. It's, it's, beats is like an Apple luxury
[01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:26.100]  brand where it's accessible luxury. Right. And depending on your taste in music,
[01:54:26.100 --> 01:54:30.660]  you know, it's, it's as good of, I don't, people are going to crucify me for this. It's
[01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:34.860]  a good performance you can get, right? You have people like that sound. I know it's not
[01:54:34.860 --> 01:54:39.940]  technically accurate, right? It's, you know, it's, you know, but the point is you're not,
[01:54:39.940 --> 01:54:43.900]  you're not, you're, most people don't feel like they're sacrificing, like to use a virtue,
[01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:47.900]  you're sacrificing, right? You're not using an iPhone. Exactly. Oh, they make androids
[01:54:47.900 --> 01:54:53.420]  now I think. Yeah. Yeah. And don't you think there's some, you know, and quality, you know,
[01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:56.700]  in a certain sense, I've heard, you know, somebody told me, for example, this is, and
[01:54:56.700 --> 01:54:59.220]  this is the sort of thing, I don't know a lot about headphones. I really didn't know
[01:54:59.220 --> 01:55:02.180]  a lot about beats before Apple bought them. But one guy wrote me and said, you know why
[01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:07.420]  I buy beats headphones? They have an amazing return policy and they'll take care of you.
[01:55:07.420 --> 01:55:10.580]  Like he said, I bought a pair of beats, cost me 300 bucks and like nine months later they
[01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:14.220]  broke and I took them back and they just took them and gave me a new pair. No questions
[01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:18.260]  asked. And he goes, that's, it's, it can't be beat and you don't get that sort of thing
[01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:23.420]  from other companies. Yeah. Making people happy and building a relationship. I don't,
[01:55:23.420 --> 01:55:28.060]  I don't know, I don't know a ton about, you know, beats specifically, but what, what strikes
[01:55:28.060 --> 01:55:32.860]  me about these, um, yeah, I'm more interested not in your take on beats, but on the, just
[01:55:32.860 --> 01:55:37.180]  on the, the, the hiring of, you know, that one or two could be an outlier, but it seems
[01:55:37.180 --> 01:55:42.460]  to be a trend. Yeah. I mean, to me that, that suggests one, that the wearable thing is multiple
[01:55:42.460 --> 01:55:49.300]  things. Um, two, that, uh, they're, they're focused on fashion first. Yeah. You know,
[01:55:49.300 --> 01:55:54.380]  I missed that word. Fashion's an important word, I think. But three, I thought it was
[01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:59.380]  most interesting that this guy was the sales director because that's a completely different
[01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:05.620]  kettle of fish than, than retail, which they already do. Or, or the CEO, which you could
[01:56:05.620 --> 01:56:10.140]  certainly see him tie more into the product side of things. But this guy is not doing
[01:56:10.140 --> 01:56:14.900]  product. He's not actually making the things he's selling things. He presumably has connections
[01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:20.220]  with the department, you know, these Asian department stores that sell LVMH products
[01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:27.100]  or with, um, you know, the, the duty-free shops. And like, you know, over here that
[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:31.700]  I'm not over here anymore, but like that, that sell that had LA bag, that's that sell,
[01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:36.620]  you know, champagne that sell all the perfumes. Like I think they're Christian Dior is part
[01:56:36.620 --> 01:56:40.860]  of them and all that sort of stuff. Um, that's super interesting because it's just, it's
[01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:43.860]  not just that Apple is doing a new product, but they're talking about a new channel, a
[01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:49.220]  new distribution strategy. Um, and I would suspect that Aaron's would have a very, a
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:53.980]  lot to say about that as well. Um, because you know, the nutritional Burberry outlet,
[01:56:53.980 --> 01:56:57.940]  yes, they are in the same place as Apple stores. The Apple stores, like Apple stores have been
[01:56:57.940 --> 01:57:03.340]  in malls and stuff like that. Like the there's, there's not a Burberry in, in your typical
[01:57:03.340 --> 01:57:09.460]  suburban mall. Um, there is a Burberry in like the, you know, the Hong Kong airport
[01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:15.020]  or like the Taipei 101 building, like, which is like these super high end shopping destinations
[01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:20.140]  or like the, the shops at Caesars in, uh, right in the middle of the, like the most,
[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:25.440]  the best intersection of the, the strip in Vegas. Right. And Apple does do that internationally
[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:29.860]  with their stores. Like, so with this is only, it's really interesting to that, that makes,
[01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:33.940]  that's really interesting about analyzing Apple. And I, I wanted to get this, um, it's
[01:57:33.940 --> 01:57:40.700]  like it differs by region, right? The way Apple presents itself in the U S is different
[01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:45.500]  than they're presented in like China, for example, where it's much more of a luxury
[01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:50.140]  good and their stores are next to, it's next to the Louis Vuitton store. Whereas in the
[01:57:50.140 --> 01:57:56.100]  U S it's famously, they're always next to Victoria's secrets. Um, it's just a different,
[01:57:56.100 --> 01:57:58.020]  it's a different presentation and
[01:57:58.020 --> 01:58:05.900]  But yet they also have, for example, a true flagship, uh, destination store on fifth Avenue
[01:58:05.900 --> 01:58:06.900]  in New York.
[01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:08.220]  Oh, for sure. Yeah, they, they both in the U S
[01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:13.300]  That they do both. Right. That they're right there on fifth Avenue with the true flagship,
[01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:17.640]  you know, almost, almost sickening how, how, you know, when you see how many people take
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:22.220]  pictures in front of it and, you know, with all the other landmarks in New York. Um, but
[01:58:22.220 --> 01:58:26.300]  yet, you know, at the same time they're at the Burlington mall in, uh, uh, New Hampshire.
[01:58:26.300 --> 01:58:29.980]  Yep. No, exactly. And so that, that's, and the other thing is like this, this is why
[01:58:29.980 --> 01:58:35.540]  Apple will never release the low end iPhone. Right. Because the, that, that would hurt
[01:58:35.540 --> 01:58:40.900]  their, that would hurt their brand in other parts of the world, even if, um, and, and
[01:58:40.900 --> 01:58:46.660]  so it's, it's super interesting. The hiring the sales guy, because, um, that's why that
[01:58:46.660 --> 01:58:52.180]  also makes me think like, you're not going to get into these stores selling a, a smart
[01:58:52.180 --> 01:58:57.980]  watch that looks good. You're going to get in these stores by selling a desirable object
[01:58:57.980 --> 01:59:05.200]  that also has this functionality. Um, and, and that's the, again, I don't see there being
[01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:08.100]  a bulky screen on it. I don't see there being a charger with it. I think I see it being
[01:59:08.100 --> 01:59:13.660]  something that's very, um, a range of things. Uh, yeah, I don't know. It's, it's, it's
[01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:18.460]  super interesting. Yeah. Uh, let me correct myself. Rockingham mall, Rockingham park.
[01:59:18.460 --> 01:59:21.700]  That's where I used to go to the Apple store when I lived up in Massachusetts. It's great
[01:59:21.700 --> 01:59:25.980]  that we know more about like suburban malls than we do the names of luxury goods companies
[01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:30.860]  in beautiful Salem, uh, New Hampshire. Uh, yeah, I totally agree. And, and like I said,
[01:59:30.860 --> 01:59:36.100]  I stand by this. I really do. And the more than a week since I wrote it, I really do
[01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:43.060]  think that it has to start with a design that before you even see what it does, when you
[01:59:43.060 --> 01:59:47.660]  hold it up, that you say, Ooh, I might buy that and wear it. Yep. It has to. And I know
[01:59:47.660 --> 01:59:55.580]  that that sounds, there's a certain, um, logical minded engineering mindset out there, you
[01:59:55.580 --> 01:59:59.300]  know, and I think, you know, sort of people who might be drawn more towards the Google
[01:59:59.300 --> 02:00:03.620]  side of things than the Apple side of things who thinks that's, that's crazy. Why in the
[02:00:03.620 --> 02:00:08.300]  world would you, why would that matter? You know, it's function first, right? And I'm
[02:00:08.300 --> 02:00:12.340]  telling you that for me, and I think for the mass market, you've got to start with something
[02:00:12.340 --> 02:00:17.860]  where you just hold it up and before you turn it on, people say, Oh, I want that. Yep. You
[02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:21.480]  know, I hate to say it. I think the iPhone was like that. And I think the most amazing
[02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:26.140]  thing about the iPhone was what the software did and how the screen worked. But I think,
[02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:29.660]  you know, it could've just held that up and not even turn the screen on and said, here's
[02:00:29.660 --> 02:00:32.860]  the iPhone. And people would have been like, Oh, where do I get in line? So what's interesting
[02:00:32.860 --> 02:00:37.340]  is this takes it full circle, right? Because we just talked with beginning where the hardware
[02:00:37.340 --> 02:00:41.540]  actually wasn't Apple's most important thing. It was the software, but in a lot of ways
[02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:46.340]  for a new category, it's, it's the hardware that gets you in the door and then you hook
[02:00:46.340 --> 02:00:50.180]  people and now, and now there's, they're stuck on the software and they, and then they're
[02:00:50.180 --> 02:00:55.060]  not going anywhere. Right. Yeah. It's, you know, it's never, never, you know, there's,
[02:00:55.060 --> 02:00:57.460]  there's certain areas where the software is more important in certain areas where the
[02:00:57.460 --> 02:01:01.420]  hardware is more important, but it never, never, you're always in trouble if you start
[02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:06.300]  saying that Apple is either a hardware company that does software well or a software company
[02:01:06.300 --> 02:01:11.780]  that does hardware. Well, it's, it's, you got to see it as a virtuous cycle that they're,
[02:01:11.780 --> 02:01:15.260]  you know, neither is more important than the other. They just add, there's certain aspects
[02:01:15.260 --> 02:01:19.920]  of the product cycle where one is more important than the other. All right. Let's call that
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:24.680]  a show. Ben Thompson. Thank you. Where can people find more people who want more Ben
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:32.640]  Thompson can go to, let's say there's Stratechery, Stratechery, S T R A T E C H E R Y.com. Yeah.
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:36.700]  Just Google Ben Thompson blog. Ben Thompson. I show up, I show up at first. People always
[02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:41.860]  give me a hard time because my website's like official name is Stratechery by Ben Thompson,
[02:01:41.860 --> 02:01:46.380]  but with a name like Ben Thompson, you have to like, yeah, I don't blame you. I don't
[02:01:46.380 --> 02:01:51.820]  blame you one bit. Uh, there's the exponent podcast, which I've been listening to. Very
[02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:59.380]  good. That's an exponent.fm. I just did that by memory. Yeah, no, I liked it. I think.
[02:01:59.380 --> 02:02:01.620]  I don't know if Marco started it, but that's where obviously where I got it from was the
[02:02:01.620 --> 02:02:06.900]  whole FM for podcasts. Oh, I think it's great. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, it gets totally memorable
[02:02:06.900 --> 02:02:10.060]  and it's easy to get names too. Cause it costs like 80 bucks a year. Right. Which is high
[02:02:10.060 --> 02:02:15.200]  enough that people aren't going to squat on it. Um, right. But not like crazy. So yeah,
[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:20.100]  it's funny. You get to be, uh, an adult and you have 80 bucks a year and it's actually
[02:02:20.100 --> 02:02:24.900]  a good thing. Whereas I started registering domain names and it was like, what do you
[02:02:24.900 --> 02:02:28.980]  mean you want $15 a year? I just registered one for $8 a year. It was funny though is
[02:02:28.980 --> 02:02:35.020]  I, I have my domains registered at, at a company called Gandhi. Um, yeah. And uh, and they
[02:02:35.020 --> 02:02:39.700]  tell you like how much you've spent on domains. Oh, that's terrible. Why would you do that?
[02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:44.020]  I know it's, it's, it's, it's, it's pretty, cause now it's been years, right? I've been
[02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:49.940]  carrying domains for like 10, 15 years at this point. Um, that's up. Oh my God. Yeah.
[02:02:49.940 --> 02:02:52.820]  It's like when Mike Montero was on the show, it's like you never tell an addict how much
[02:02:52.820 --> 02:02:58.540]  they've spent. Like you get a bar tab, but they don't put like a thing at the bottom
[02:02:58.540 --> 02:03:04.060]  of your bar tab that tells you like, here's what you've spent year to date, right? Nobody
[02:03:04.060 --> 02:03:09.060]  would do that. Like your beer distributor does not give you a a year to date, you know,
[02:03:09.060 --> 02:03:15.400]  tab. It'd be crazy. Anyway, last but not least on Twitter, a excellent Twitter account. You
[02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:25.180]  are, um, at monk M O N K bent B E N T as in Ben Thompson. That's me. Uh, so thank you
[02:03:25.180 --> 02:03:29.220]  very much. Great show. This was absolutely great. I think it was worth it just for thinking
[02:03:29.220 --> 02:03:36.900]  of Android wear as, as windows mobile 2.0 alone. Cause to me that's just put that finger
[02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:40.960]  right on the middle of the button of what I see as being the problem with it. Anyway,
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:46.780]  thank you Ben. Good to be here. I'm hitting stop.
