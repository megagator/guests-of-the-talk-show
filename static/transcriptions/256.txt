[00:00.000 --> 00:06.560]  How did you hear about it? Here's the funny thing for me is I heard about it. My dad called me. So it was like I
[00:07.120 --> 00:11.340]  Guess around five o'clock Eastern Time. I think the news dropped around
[00:12.240 --> 00:14.240]  430 Eastern Time and
[00:15.420 --> 00:17.420]  my dad
[00:17.560 --> 00:19.560]  82 year old Bob Gruber
[00:20.000 --> 00:24.080]  Great health plays golf every day doing great. Very lucky
[00:24.080 --> 00:29.460]  He's in such great health. Glad to have him around not not really
[00:30.080 --> 00:33.880]  Doesn't really understand much of what I do doesn't is not a computer person
[00:35.640 --> 00:41.600]  You know as and and so therefore doesn't really follow closely what I write about
[00:43.520 --> 00:50.560]  Has long not really understood how I make a living but as you know seems to understand that I'm doing well that I'm well
[00:50.560 --> 00:53.800]  well known, you know, he watched my my my
[00:54.520 --> 01:01.440]  Live episode of the talk show on YouTube said he didn't understand and almost any of it, but he thought it was a very nice show
[01:04.080 --> 01:06.080]  Very classic dad. Yes. Yeah
[01:07.480 --> 01:09.280]  Calls me up
[01:09.280 --> 01:11.280]  You know, we talk on the phone almost every day
[01:12.080 --> 01:17.240]  Every time my phone rings it is either my dad or it is a it's a robo call
[01:17.240 --> 01:23.200]  It's pretty much the only phone calls. I get I very much enjoy my daily phone calls with my dad. I
[01:24.280 --> 01:26.080]  Really do. I
[01:26.080 --> 01:29.040]  Generally don't get breaking news that matters to me
[01:29.760 --> 01:34.440]  From my dad, but my dad calls me up and he's like John it's dad here
[01:35.120 --> 01:41.760]  Of course, he always says that you know, right which surprise surprise you you had no idea. All right, let me know who it is and
[01:42.960 --> 01:45.800]  he says I'm watching TV and they're saying that
[01:45.800 --> 01:53.000]  That this fellow at Apple Joni Joni. I've is is leaving the company and I'm like what and he's like Jimmy Jimmy. I've
[01:54.440 --> 01:58.360]  John you're like Jimmy. I mean, so he like called him Joni
[01:59.240 --> 02:01.760]  called him Johnny called him Jimmy and
[02:03.120 --> 02:07.400]  And he's like he's that he's leaving the company. That's what they're saying. And and I
[02:08.400 --> 02:10.400]  You know, I I
[02:10.680 --> 02:14.600]  I'm surprised. I did not expect it per se
[02:14.600 --> 02:21.800]  Expected per se but it wasn't totally shocking, but I effectively had to say well then I I gotta go
[02:22.240 --> 02:27.040]  Right. It's like I understand. He's like I just wanted you to know and I'm like, well, thanks
[02:27.040 --> 02:32.080]  And then you know, I went hit the internet and of course, you know, he was out
[02:33.280 --> 02:38.400]  I was very strange way for me to hear about though. I you know from
[02:38.400 --> 02:45.360]  This is from your dad from my 82 year old dad who doesn't really understand the company who really wasn't sure how to pronounce
[02:46.000 --> 02:48.000]  his first name
[02:49.280 --> 02:56.180]  Well, I found out as with most things via Twitter I'm looking at at by my feed it was
[02:56.640 --> 03:03.760]  Around 5 12 p.m. I was not surprised because I feel like this has been sort of a a long slow
[03:03.760 --> 03:08.160]  Exit out the door and this is sort of formalized. He said that's been the case for a while
[03:08.160 --> 03:10.920]  So, I mean, it's one of those things, you know
[03:12.760 --> 03:14.760]  Don't want to do the I told you so but I
[03:17.040 --> 03:22.960]  That is exactly this entire the entire reason I thought well I have to a I have to write about it right away
[03:22.960 --> 03:27.040]  And then I thought the next thing I got to do is I got to record an episode on my show tomorrow
[03:27.040 --> 03:32.000]  Who do I have on and I was like I gotta have Ben Thompson because he can do two hours if I told you so
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.320]  Well, no, it's more the case that when a few years ago
[03:36.320 --> 03:39.360]  This was four years ago when he became chief design officer
[03:39.640 --> 03:44.400]  And he was a chief design officer with no one actually sort of reporting to him or at least in sort of a managerial
[03:44.640 --> 03:47.000]  Context right that to me that was you know
[03:47.000 --> 03:52.160]  a big red flag that he's kind of definitely stepping back from what he was doing and I wrote this at the time and
[03:52.360 --> 03:55.320]  It's more like I'm okay to pass something
[03:55.320 --> 03:58.760]  I told you so I figure like they'll accumulate and people can can do that this one
[03:58.760 --> 04:03.960]  I got so much grief about it like people were coming at me from left and right Apple fans in particular
[04:04.080 --> 04:07.960]  because this was a day it was a day that David I'd made it free because I thought it was sort of a really big
[04:07.960 --> 04:10.040]  deal, and so this is more of a
[04:11.040 --> 04:16.880]  Still sort of licking my wounds from four years ago that I felt compelled to sort of point this out
[04:18.680 --> 04:21.360]  I will say this that from what I have heard
[04:22.080 --> 04:28.080]  So far from friends sources little birdies at Apple at least at Apple
[04:28.080 --> 04:30.800]  It is a bit of a surprise
[04:32.000 --> 04:38.640]  Almost and one one even said shocking, you know, even though not not in terms of the fact that like
[04:39.400 --> 04:46.200]  Nobody thought it might not happen. Like I think people have been thinking, you know in even inside Apple that this
[04:46.960 --> 04:52.600]  You know, he might be easing his way out the door, but they still found it shocking
[04:52.600 --> 04:56.840]  You know, it's not like Oh everybody at Apple kind of knew this was coming, you know
[04:56.840 --> 05:03.560]  I think everybody I think everybody shocked but not surprised. Yeah, I think that yeah, it was definitely shocking like you
[05:03.560 --> 05:08.480]  He's such an institution that that you would think, you know, it is a shock
[05:08.480 --> 05:13.560]  So I guess I'm wrong to say that it isn't but it's more like it's it's when you think about it for two seconds
[05:13.560 --> 05:15.520]  Like yeah, I guess that I guess that kind of makes sense, right?
[05:15.520 --> 05:18.840]  I mean one of the things is you know, he's he's not
[05:19.400 --> 05:21.480]  That old I think he's 51
[05:21.480 --> 05:28.680]  But yeah, it's certainly not retiring or you know, according to you know what they're saying
[05:30.120 --> 05:33.080]  Yeah, he's not done designing. He's not done working
[05:34.920 --> 05:41.600]  There's a lot of quite a few I would guess I haven't gone through the entire list of Apple's
[05:42.200 --> 05:44.600]  executive bio page to figure out their ages but
[05:46.240 --> 05:49.640]  He's not even close to the oldest right he's younger than Tim Cook
[05:49.640 --> 05:58.120]  He's younger than Phil Schiller. He's you know, there's quite a few people on the executive team who are older than him
[06:02.120 --> 06:03.320]  I
[06:03.320 --> 06:06.320]  Don't know but the whole thing is a bit weird, right? I
[06:06.840 --> 06:12.080]  Mean, I don't know because I mean well first off just it put in the the bigger context
[06:12.080 --> 06:15.480]  Like like I said you there's things to suggest that this was coming
[06:15.480 --> 06:22.200]  But I think if you back up and think about it the you know, what did Johnny I've do like what right?
[06:22.200 --> 06:27.240]  What was he about and you know, I wrote about it this morning my daily updates that you know
[06:27.240 --> 06:33.800]  If you if you go back like to me the most the biggest most important Johnny I've product is is the iMac
[06:33.800 --> 06:39.640]  But but sort of you know a couple years on after the iMac you had the iMac running OS X with iTunes on it
[06:39.640 --> 06:45.240]  And if you kind of squint that's basically the same product that Apple shipped for the next couple of years
[06:45.240 --> 06:49.800]  For the next 20 years, it just sort of changed the name to being iPhone iOS and App Store
[06:49.800 --> 06:53.680]  But it was the same that like that idea that triumpher it is what Apple?
[06:54.280 --> 07:00.600]  Is what Apple was about and we haven't had a chance to talk on the podcast since WWDC
[07:00.680 --> 07:04.040]  But one thing that was really compelling to me about WWC
[07:04.040 --> 07:09.280]  I thought was so interesting was it really felt like that chapter of Apple was sort of drawing to a close
[07:09.280 --> 07:13.840]  And I thought it was actually a fairly significant momentous that you had iTunes being shut down
[07:13.840 --> 07:19.320]  Yeah, you had Swift UI coming along which was which in many respects kind of closed that door on that era of operating systems
[07:19.320 --> 07:25.240]  also, and if you think about it like Johnny I've death that was the Johnny I've era and that
[07:25.680 --> 07:30.880]  aspect of Apple in everything from the products that drive the growth to
[07:31.240 --> 07:34.920]  Sort of the the structure of Apple being a sort of top-down
[07:35.600 --> 07:39.400]  Dictatorship very streamlined very fun a functional organization things that you know
[07:39.400 --> 07:45.520]  All getting into the nitty-gritty of organizational structure and those sorts of things like that's also sort of falling apart and going by the wayside
[07:45.520 --> 07:49.200]  As well, which is what happens when companies get to the size that Apple is
[07:49.200 --> 07:50.960]  So I think if you zoom out
[07:50.960 --> 07:56.640]  There is a lot about this about the timing and everything about it that actually makes quite a bit of sense. I
[07:58.560 --> 08:00.560]  Guess I agree with that
[08:00.560 --> 08:04.140]  You know our mutual friend Brent Simmons described
[08:04.840 --> 08:08.040]  WWDC with Swift UI as as the
[08:08.040 --> 08:14.640]  The end of the next era at Apple, you know in terms of the software and you know
[08:14.640 --> 08:15.800]  That is the one thing, you know
[08:15.800 --> 08:23.240]  Johnny was already at Apple when when then as I called the next reunification happened and you know, Steve Jobs has
[08:23.760 --> 08:26.860]  Had said several times that you know
[08:26.860 --> 08:32.320]  One of the very pleasant surprises when he came back to Apple after the next
[08:33.080 --> 08:34.880]  acquisition slash
[08:34.880 --> 08:39.520]  Anti acquisition whatever reverse acquisition, right? That's why I call it the reunification
[08:39.520 --> 08:44.440]  It's like when you look at the what next did and it was wasn't that long
[08:44.440 --> 08:50.320]  That's the thing is that next I think only started in like 1988 and by 1997 they'd been
[08:50.840 --> 08:55.640]  Acquired, you know at the end of very end of 1996. They were acquired by Apple
[08:55.840 --> 08:56.720]  so
[08:56.720 --> 09:03.080]  It it's pretty wild right like the the current era of Apple the dominant era of Apple is like twice as long
[09:03.080 --> 09:09.560]  As as like the non Steve Jobs era about right it's exactly it is kind of wild when you think about it
[09:09.560 --> 09:16.240]  But because I was young and the computer industry was young and there were new platforms coming every few years
[09:16.520 --> 09:19.400]  You know, you had the BOS and you know
[09:19.400 --> 09:25.160]  You had the silicon graphics and you had Sun and and all these other companies and there were a bunch of you know
[09:25.520 --> 09:29.040]  Much more competition just be and I think that's typical, you know
[09:29.040 --> 09:34.680]  We we don't have to go off in the weeds on this but it's typical for an industry in the early years to have
[09:35.280 --> 09:43.480]  More competition and more new upstarts and then things settle in and there's a one or two dominant players
[09:45.200 --> 09:52.920]  You know the software side wasn't Johnny and you know and then the software side of modern Apple all came from the next acquisition
[09:53.480 --> 09:55.860]  But I think you're right that that
[09:55.860 --> 10:01.700]  Swift UI is the first thing that they've done since then. That is
[10:03.580 --> 10:07.260]  New you know, it's it's it's not based on the
[10:08.860 --> 10:10.580]  Next
[10:10.580 --> 10:15.980]  Application frameworks, right? Right because Swift is like a programming language, right? That's a fairly sort of generic thing like Swift UI
[10:15.980 --> 10:16.740]  Oh, there it goes
[10:16.740 --> 10:17.500]  I think they're finished
[10:17.500 --> 10:23.740]  Swift UI is like that's getting it like the framework of how the operating system actually works and how it actually like show stuff on
[10:23.740 --> 10:29.500]  The screen and all like it's much more embedded into the OS itself as opposed to something like, you know
[10:29.820 --> 10:34.140]  Like a programming language like you're getting deeper into what is OS 10 itself?
[10:34.140 --> 10:38.400]  Yeah, and it's now something different than it was previously or yeah OS I guess I should say
[10:39.040 --> 10:41.540]  But you know and but it's an interesting
[10:42.140 --> 10:44.140]  you know
[10:44.620 --> 10:46.620]  Inflection point because
[10:46.980 --> 10:51.900]  back then in the late 90s when Apple was
[10:51.900 --> 10:55.940]  Furiously working to deliver OS 10
[10:57.660 --> 10:59.260]  You know, it was a you know
[10:59.260 --> 11:03.540]  I think that it was a late night did like seriously like after after Christmas
[11:04.100 --> 11:10.540]  1996 like very very late December when they acquired next I think it was after Christmas
[11:10.540 --> 11:17.900]  It was definitely late December. So effectively it was 1997 and you know, there was that whole period where
[11:17.900 --> 11:22.940]  It wasn't like they acquired them and said, okay. Now Steve Jobs is back and he's in charge. There was that whole
[11:24.620 --> 11:29.260]  You know, I you know, he's just gonna be an advisor and you know
[11:30.380 --> 11:31.020]  You know
[11:31.020 --> 11:33.780]  I wasn't sure what he wanted to do and then they you know
[11:33.780 --> 11:41.060]  Ran Gil Amelio out of the company and and he became they literally called him the I CEO right interim CEO
[11:41.620 --> 11:46.340]  It was like the I like the first I right. Yeah, the first I wasn't the iMac
[11:46.340 --> 11:51.260]  It was Steve Jobs. He was the I CEO because he was interim CEO and he's like, well
[11:51.260 --> 11:56.380]  I'll take over a CEO until we find the real CEO and it was quite a while before
[11:56.380 --> 11:58.420]  You know, they made the announcement that you know what?
[11:59.420 --> 12:03.500]  This is good. This is gonna work. I'm staying I'm sticking around. I'll be the CEO
[12:04.820 --> 12:11.380]  But in that era when and they you know had a ton of work to do to to turn
[12:11.380 --> 12:15.860]  What they had software-wise into what they needed to be Mac OS X
[12:17.980 --> 12:18.980]  It was years
[12:18.980 --> 12:21.980]  I mean it was 1997 when they started and and
[12:22.500 --> 12:28.180]  Next was an interesting very interesting and very impressive technical operating system at the time
[12:29.180 --> 12:36.220]  But to become what it needed to be to be Apple's new Macintosh operating system. It really needed a lot more and
[12:36.220 --> 12:42.500]  It didn't ship until I think 2001. Yep. No 2001. It went looking backwards
[12:42.500 --> 12:45.340]  Is this unbelievably momentous year in? Yeah
[12:45.340 --> 12:52.540]  Well, yeah because in January 2001 you had the keynote where jobs announced the future was they had the hub
[12:53.260 --> 12:58.980]  The digital hub idea and that the thing they're gonna focus on as far as the spokes on the hub was gonna be music
[12:58.980 --> 13:02.100]  Yep, and they had iTunes and this was a huge trend a huge trend
[13:02.100 --> 13:07.700]  But huge switch because only like seven months previously they said they were gonna focus on movies and then that there's that intervening period
[13:07.700 --> 13:13.100]  Where they're like, oh crap this thing's happening with mp3s and we're totally missing it and they bought sound jam and pivoted and did all that
[13:13.100 --> 13:15.100]  Yeah, so that's January in February
[13:16.140 --> 13:20.780]  Rubenstein John Rubenstein goes to goes to Japan goes to visit to Shiba
[13:20.780 --> 13:25.140]  They show him this little hard drive saying we don't know what to do with this, right at the time
[13:25.220 --> 13:29.740]  Most hard drives with the small hard drives that you would be able to do with a hard drive
[13:29.740 --> 13:34.660]  He goes to hard drives with the small hard drives that you would put in a laptop. I think we're 2.5 inches
[13:35.460 --> 13:41.980]  And he went there for like a regular visit to like hey check on the state-of-the-art and they were like, hey
[13:41.980 --> 13:45.980]  We've we've made these 1.8 inch hard. We have no idea what to do with them
[13:45.980 --> 13:51.820]  Right because it was like the laptop people were like, well, we don't need you know, 2.5 is fine
[13:51.820 --> 13:54.940]  You know, like like the different slow. It's too small
[13:54.940 --> 14:00.260]  Yeah, a slower hard drive, but that's only this much smaller doesn't make a difference to us
[14:00.260 --> 14:04.100]  if we've already putting it into a laptop form factor and
[14:05.260 --> 14:11.180]  But Rubenstein, yeah, as you're pointing out it was like hey, maybe there's something else we could make work where this
[14:12.180 --> 14:16.180]  Decrease in size would actually make a difference and and this is actually a really important point
[14:16.180 --> 14:22.540]  I think we'll I want to reference further the podcast will sort of put a stake here. That was February 2001
[14:22.540 --> 14:28.020]  They shipped the iPod in September of 2001. No, so I think it was actually October
[14:28.540 --> 14:34.180]  They were go they announced it in September. I think or something around was it because of 9-eleven?
[14:34.180 --> 14:39.220]  Yeah, it was because of 9-eleven they were I think they were going to ship it announce it in September and then 9-eleven
[14:39.700 --> 14:45.500]  Happened and they postponed it and then made in my opinion. I've never heard this
[14:45.500 --> 14:48.140]  I've never confirmed this but I think that they then
[14:48.140 --> 14:52.720]  Made the original iPod announcement a bit lower-key
[14:53.540 --> 14:57.580]  Than they would have it was it was I was not it was before it was
[14:58.100 --> 15:03.460]  2001 is before I was even writing during fireball. So I wasn't it wasn't even close to when I would have been invited to a
[15:04.220 --> 15:07.780]  Apple media event, but I do remember it was held at their
[15:08.860 --> 15:11.460]  very small town hall at the old
[15:12.260 --> 15:14.260]  infinite loop campus and
[15:14.260 --> 15:18.100]  It's an interesting thing to watch again, you know, I I think you do the same thing
[15:18.100 --> 15:20.100]  I do is you rewatch some of these old
[15:20.380 --> 15:25.100]  Apple announcements and in hindsight you you can kind of gain some insights
[15:25.820 --> 15:28.660]  The original iPod announcement was very low-key
[15:28.660 --> 15:34.300]  and I think I think it's just because everyone the whole world was just low-key after 9-eleven and I
[15:34.900 --> 15:40.300]  You know not I don't think it was a mistake. Maybe maybe they would have played it that way anyway, but I
[15:40.300 --> 15:46.500]  I it's hard to think that it wasn't colored in some way by the general mood of the entire
[15:47.740 --> 15:53.460]  Civilization post nine. Yeah. No, you're right. It was October but but but just to make the broader point
[15:53.460 --> 15:59.500]  That's eight months from from idea like not even like drawings from idea to product
[15:59.500 --> 16:04.100]  And the other thing I think that's useful to remember back to this point is Apple was still
[16:04.100 --> 16:10.580]  So much more of a hardware company in this particular in this case. They outsource the operating system, right?
[16:10.580 --> 16:15.920]  Yeah, like it was built by what is it a pick-pick pixel and Apple's pixo right picks up. Yeah
[16:17.260 --> 16:22.180]  Apple supervised it and dealt with it. But I mean, it's kind of like the iMac like the original iMac
[16:22.180 --> 16:28.220]  I mean, I know I'm gonna get some of your listeners mad probably including you but I mean OS 10 was I called it
[16:28.220 --> 16:31.060]  I did today a decrepit operating system, right?
[16:31.060 --> 16:37.540]  It still had a great sort of user experience OS 10 or OS OS 9. Yeah classic classic Mac
[16:37.540 --> 16:42.880]  I should say um, and the you know, the components were terrible. It was slow it could be like
[16:43.740 --> 16:45.740]  It was a no
[16:46.540 --> 16:52.200]  No, no, no, I meant max relative to Intel PCs at that time were were so I'm not saying
[16:54.020 --> 16:59.700]  Actually the operations was very snappy right because it was where it was built it was so close to the metal right the operating
[16:59.700 --> 17:02.140]  System was fast. The hardware was
[17:03.580 --> 17:05.580]  problematic and and
[17:05.620 --> 17:13.260]  In that era, you know, I was I've been a non-stop Mac person Apple person, you know, even going back to the 80s
[17:14.140 --> 17:20.780]  Yeah, that's fair. But I think you have to say that if there was any argument of slowness it was result. It was the
[17:21.860 --> 17:23.100]  Motorola
[17:23.100 --> 17:24.860]  CPUs
[17:24.860 --> 17:30.540]  Exactly. No, I meant to refer the operating system to the to the CPU. But the point is is like what's interesting
[17:30.540 --> 17:36.260]  Is that era of Apple was and this is why I think it's the most it's a place where I've made the biggest difference in
[17:36.260 --> 17:41.420]  Matter the most is like I've carried Apple through that period. Yeah, right like the
[17:41.940 --> 17:47.380]  The IMAX sold because it was this gorgeous all-in-one computer that people just wanted it
[17:47.380 --> 17:49.260]  Well, it didn't sell because of its other features
[17:49.260 --> 17:52.380]  It didn't sell because of the operating system didn't sell because that is speedy processor
[17:52.380 --> 17:56.260]  Right, it sold because it was it was attractive. It was desirable
[17:56.260 --> 17:59.140]  It was a thing that you wanted to have and you wanted to have in your house
[17:59.140 --> 18:02.460]  And that was the first time ever for a computer same thing with an iPod
[18:02.460 --> 18:08.840]  I mean, yes, a huge part of the iPod was iTunes and the fact that you could all the complexity was offloaded onto the Mac
[18:08.840 --> 18:13.160]  You know certainly a theme for Apple, you know in the way they've designed their products
[18:13.220 --> 18:18.360]  But at the same time like Apple spent its resources and its time on getting the hardware, right?
[18:18.360 --> 18:23.480]  right, and they were willing to outsource or the software side of it and you know, I think it's
[18:24.040 --> 18:28.040]  In you think about the arc of Ives tenure at Apple
[18:28.800 --> 18:36.360]  to me you have to go back to this era because it's where he like you he second only to Steve Jobs he saved the company because
[18:37.200 --> 18:43.000]  Getting those products out making products that people wanted despite the fact they're missing so many important pieces
[18:43.000 --> 18:50.160]  That's what gave Apple the money gave them the resources gave them the the motivation not the motivation the the momentum
[18:50.600 --> 18:55.800]  For sort of everything that followed and to take nothing away from his designs around the you know
[18:55.800 --> 19:01.160]  The iPhone or the iPad or any of those sorts of things but all those like that was a train
[19:01.160 --> 19:04.280]  They're sort of going down the tracks at that point and Johnny
[19:04.280 --> 19:08.680]  I was very much the person that sort of got that train moving in the first place, you know
[19:08.680 --> 19:15.000]  And it's an interesting, you know, and it's in the in the statement Apple put forth yesterday to announce this
[19:15.640 --> 19:20.300]  They you know, Tim Cook's quote, you know praising Johnny I've
[19:22.320 --> 19:24.860]  Specifically called out the original iMac
[19:27.080 --> 19:32.040]  And you know, I think for good reason and I think you're right and and part of it timing wise
[19:32.040 --> 19:34.620]  Like I said was that on the software side
[19:34.620 --> 19:38.020]  Jobs and his team from next had
[19:39.540 --> 19:43.700]  At least four or five years of work to get Mac OS X out
[19:45.860 --> 19:48.740]  And you know, it's it officially shipped in 2001
[19:49.500 --> 19:53.580]  But I did you ever did you use it back then? I don't know. Do you even try it in?
[19:53.580 --> 19:55.980]  You know like the original 10.0 it
[19:56.780 --> 20:03.260]  You know, it's pretty rough. It was extremely rough. I mean it really really rough and
[20:03.260 --> 20:06.060]  Serious Mac users who had work to do
[20:07.900 --> 20:14.260]  Didn't use it. I mean it was years and you know that somebody was another podcast I forget where somebody was
[20:15.300 --> 20:17.300]  talking recently oh
[20:17.300 --> 20:22.260]  It was on it was on my podcast. It was it was
[20:23.580 --> 20:26.580]  Jaws story about the the
[20:27.820 --> 20:30.700]  Funeral that they held on stage for Mac
[20:30.700 --> 20:33.980]  Classic Mac OS 9, you know
[20:34.780 --> 20:38.380]  the great story he told at the beginning of my live show and
[20:39.180 --> 20:41.180]  and John Moltz is
[20:41.340 --> 20:44.300]  Crazy Apple rumors story that it after it had been
[20:45.180 --> 20:50.380]  Had a funeral that it had been resuscitated and brought back to life and how?
[20:51.020 --> 20:55.580]  Everybody including Steve Jobs at Apple had greatly enjoyed enjoyed the story
[20:55.580 --> 21:01.740]  But that was like 2004 when they were it was like three years after it shipped and they're still holding macworld expos
[21:01.900 --> 21:04.780]  where Steve Jobs is holding a a
[21:05.500 --> 21:09.100]  You know tongue-in-cheek funeral for Mac OS 9
[21:11.740 --> 21:15.580]  Which was a very funny way of effectively saying hey
[21:16.380 --> 21:18.460]  You know this new this new one
[21:18.460 --> 21:21.420]  We know that a lot of you've been holding out but this new one is actually you know
[21:21.420 --> 21:27.740]  It is the future the this the old OS has no future and it's good now. It's good enough. It's so
[21:28.460 --> 21:34.860]  You know that was seven years after the acquisition before they they held the event where they were like hey classic Mac OS is dead
[21:34.860 --> 21:42.140]  it was a very long time to get Mac OS 10 to where it needed to be to be like fast enough and snappy enough and
[21:42.940 --> 21:47.900]  Robust enough to say this this is the Apple Mac operating system
[21:47.900 --> 21:54.700]  In the meantime, you know, like you said 1998 was only like a year after jobs came back and they shipped the iMac and
[21:55.740 --> 22:01.500]  It was a sensation. I mean, it's there's no other way to describe it
[22:01.500 --> 22:07.820]  It was an absolute sensation and it was purely based on design
[22:08.220 --> 22:12.300]  Right it like you said it wasn't it wasn't like a world-beating processor
[22:12.460 --> 22:16.540]  It wasn't you know, the design of the Mac OS is not a world-beating processor
[22:16.540 --> 22:18.540]  It wasn't you know, the g3
[22:19.420 --> 22:21.420]  Whatever it was a g3
[22:21.740 --> 22:23.260]  166
[22:23.260 --> 22:26.220]  Megahertz or something like that a hundred and something
[22:28.300 --> 22:32.300]  Wasn't that great compared to the state-of-the-art for the industry
[22:33.460 --> 22:40.220]  It was a CRT. That was just you know, just a sort of standard CRT display
[22:41.100 --> 22:43.100]  the operating system
[22:43.100 --> 22:48.860]  was I in my opinion, you know, we can argue we shouldn't argue about it here on the show, but
[22:49.620 --> 22:55.540]  Because it'll take up all of our time, but the Mac operating system still had a great design
[22:56.060 --> 23:02.380]  Yeah, we're on the same page. It's more from a technical underpinning perspective like it protected memory exactly
[23:02.380 --> 23:07.460]  Didn't that protected memory and you know and by the late 90s you kind of needed protected memory, you know
[23:07.460 --> 23:10.540]  You did need it. It was outdated. It should have been
[23:10.540 --> 23:16.500]  you know Apple should have made that transition five to six years earlier and they didn't through
[23:16.860 --> 23:21.900]  mismanagement and it was you know, you could say well in hindsight five six years isn't that long but you know
[23:22.140 --> 23:25.980]  You've missed something like that and all of a sudden you're behind the curve
[23:26.220 --> 23:34.140]  It wasn't a world-beating operating system and it wasn't anything different wasn't like the iMac shipped with a different looking version of Mac OS
[23:34.140 --> 23:40.740]  Then you could get on any other Mac that you could have bought in 95 96 97, right? It
[23:40.780 --> 23:46.260]  So it wasn't the software. It wasn't the processor it it just had a regular hard drive
[23:46.260 --> 23:50.100]  There was nothing else really the only other technical thing
[23:50.100 --> 23:55.580]  I can even vaguely think of that you could say it was kind of remarkable about it was that it
[23:55.860 --> 24:01.980]  Switched all of the IO to USB and that was interesting and it was ahead of the curve
[24:01.980 --> 24:06.540]  Even though USB is an industry standard that eventually, you know became
[24:07.860 --> 24:14.180]  The standard port on all pcs the iMac was the first one in the industry that that went to USB
[24:14.180 --> 24:17.020]  But you know, I know no describe built-in either
[24:18.180 --> 24:21.520]  Nobody was happy to strive. Yeah, no floppy. That was the other. Yeah
[24:21.520 --> 24:25.180]  so that was the other thing is it was the only the only describe was a
[24:25.180 --> 24:32.580]  A CD ROM which at that so at the time we thought it was amazing isn't this forward thinking that it doesn't have a floppy
[24:32.860 --> 24:34.860]  but in hindsight, it's like
[24:35.140 --> 24:38.860]  But it was a big deal that it had a CD our drug
[24:39.580 --> 24:42.500]  No, not even a CD are oh, you're right. You're right
[24:42.500 --> 24:47.660]  It could only read you're right because in that when they did the music thing they that was part of the mea culpa
[24:47.660 --> 24:50.580]  We missed this was that people people want to burn CDs
[24:50.580 --> 24:55.940]  So we're gonna we're gonna dad that's when it was only like 2001 or 2002 and they were like we got to put CD
[24:55.940 --> 25:02.060]  R's into everything. But anyway, it was just what it looked like. It was hey, it's all-in-one. It is
[25:03.100 --> 25:06.100]  This sort of interesting has a handle
[25:06.780 --> 25:12.260]  Fascinating to me because within two years of the iMac shipping
[25:13.100 --> 25:16.340]  the whole world of industrial design
[25:16.340 --> 25:20.140]  became obsessed with translucent plastics and
[25:21.060 --> 25:24.620]  largely translucent plastics that were in that same
[25:26.020 --> 25:30.140]  Was it but what a pronounce it Bondi Bondi blue Bondi blue
[25:31.020 --> 25:33.020]  you know you could buy like
[25:33.260 --> 25:34.580]  ironing I
[25:34.580 --> 25:39.220]  irons, you know the iron your clothes with they were the same thing you could buy like just like a
[25:41.420 --> 25:43.420]  Desk side
[25:43.420 --> 25:49.540]  Alarm clock and and they all look like the iMac or tried to look like the iMac as much as they could
[25:50.580 --> 25:52.580]  it was you know it it
[25:53.500 --> 25:57.260]  well, not just that but you mentioned how long it took to get sort of OS 10 out the door and
[25:57.820 --> 26:02.580]  So it wasn't just the the original iMac then also the iPod
[26:03.100 --> 26:09.420]  And then the the next iMac actually came out to the the one the the lampshade iMac and this was in
[26:09.420 --> 26:16.620]  2002 so basically you know I've and the industrial design team was was again
[26:16.620 --> 26:24.700]  You can't you can't underestimate the degree to which they were carrying Apple and carrying water for Apple for for a good five six
[26:24.700 --> 26:26.220]  seven years and
[26:26.220 --> 26:32.260]  Really, you know before then the iPod started when did the when did the iPod go to Windows or I can go to Windows 2004?
[26:32.260 --> 26:37.700]  I think yeah, so 2004 is kind of like a switchover point 2003 2004 somewhere
[26:37.700 --> 26:45.100]  we're where the the importance of the software kind of came back up to the level of the importance of the hardware and
[26:45.660 --> 26:52.220]  but but before that like it was like it was pretty rough like it was a hardware driven company to a far greater extent than
[26:52.220 --> 26:54.660]  than they are you know have any any time since then and
[26:55.540 --> 26:58.460]  and again and the other thing with it with the iMac is I
[26:59.100 --> 27:05.900]  Mean it's hard to appreciate for maybe young people out there like it was really out of left field like it
[27:05.900 --> 27:11.100]  No, like no one saw anything like that coming like they were I remember I used to always read the comics
[27:11.100 --> 27:15.340]  and they were like it was like in in comics like the Sunday comics and stuff like that remember there being like
[27:15.820 --> 27:22.860]  like it was it was a cultural event like it was so unlike anything that came before and it's fascinating because
[27:23.340 --> 27:25.340]  It's something that that
[27:25.660 --> 27:29.460]  It's it's still completely recognizable and at the same time
[27:29.460 --> 27:33.620]  It's so obviously the way that a computer sort of a consumer can
[27:33.620 --> 27:39.580]  Computer sort of ought to have been made I mean and then oh the other thing is in that same time period they also did
[27:39.580 --> 27:43.660]  The power book the power book was in 19 was in 2001 I believe
[27:44.140 --> 27:46.100]  Which again a brilliant?
[27:46.100 --> 27:52.900]  Industrial design that that you know basically set the design language for Apple's laptops all the way through today in many respects
[27:52.900 --> 27:54.900]  are you talking specifically about the
[27:55.420 --> 27:57.940]  Titanium g4. Yeah, that's right. That's right
[27:57.940 --> 28:02.660]  So they had to quote unquote power books before that there were power books in the late 90s
[28:02.660 --> 28:08.620]  But the one that that set the mold for the to this day the modern
[28:09.500 --> 28:15.620]  Laptop design was the titanium g4 power book. That's right, and then the and then the iBook
[28:16.260 --> 28:18.700]  was in the early 2000s
[28:20.060 --> 28:26.580]  plastic but again just a very striking sort of design it also got the colors going on and and I
[28:26.860 --> 28:30.500]  Don't like when it comes to consumer electronics like basically the most valuable
[28:30.500 --> 28:34.340]  Sort of segment there is on earth like that
[28:34.340 --> 28:41.020]  It was an unbelievable sort of 78 year stretch that really like set forth the design language for basically everyone
[28:41.180 --> 28:43.540]  That we're still using today. Yeah, absolutely
[28:44.180 --> 28:47.220]  And it's funny too because you would tend to think hardware
[28:48.060 --> 28:53.300]  Has a longer time frame than software and in at that time though
[28:53.780 --> 28:59.040]  You know and and part of what made it possible for them to do it so fast was that it wasn't like they
[28:59.040 --> 29:04.880]  Invented a new CPU or switch to a new CPU or or when right some things were much more modular then
[29:04.880 --> 29:10.360]  Yeah, much more modular and they just used a standard, you know, I guess Sony CRT
[29:13.280 --> 29:18.240]  It technically, you know, and I think it drove some people who you know, I
[29:19.320 --> 29:23.280]  Don't want to say Apple haters, but you know what? I mean Apple haters, you know
[29:23.280 --> 29:31.280]  It drove them nuts that there was nothing technically innovative about it it it made some people all the rave
[29:31.360 --> 29:36.900]  Reviews that the that the iMac got drove some people nuts because they were like wait
[29:36.900 --> 29:42.200]  This is still the same piece of crap Mac that they sold before it just has a clear
[29:43.640 --> 29:46.340]  No, but that's why it's so important though to me
[29:46.340 --> 29:52.520]  that's why it is I still think it's the most important product that that I've created because the
[29:52.520 --> 29:57.960]  The what happened was happening in that period from a sort of big-picture meta level was you know
[29:57.960 --> 30:03.400]  the reason why Apple struggled in the 80s and the 90s is that the computer market was an enterprise market and
[30:03.600 --> 30:09.640]  Apple was fundamentally a consumer company and if you want to back up the reason why Apple succeed in the 2000s and the
[30:10.320 --> 30:13.960]  2010s and Microsoft struggled is because the the the
[30:14.120 --> 30:20.360]  PC market became a consumer market and the enterprise market became much less important and if you think about it the fundamental nature the two
[30:20.360 --> 30:24.080]  Companies actually didn't change it just that the market around them changed
[30:24.080 --> 30:30.360]  But but a key sort of like pivot point in there was this product which again, it was the first computer you wanted
[30:31.220 --> 30:38.160]  Because you like it wasn't just a technical putting, you know a spreadsheet fees and speed sort of calculation
[30:38.160 --> 30:43.280]  Like there was it aroused something else in you that yes, it's hard to articulate
[30:43.280 --> 30:47.240]  It's hard to put on a spreadsheet that drives sort of nerds up the wall
[30:47.240 --> 30:50.360]  because they look at the numbers and say it doesn't make any sense, but
[30:51.000 --> 30:57.720]  Just because there isn't a number for that feeling or that desire doesn't mean it's not real and that feeling that desire
[30:57.720 --> 31:02.320]  Like that is the intersection of you know, liberal arts and technology that Steve Jobs talks about that
[31:02.320 --> 31:04.640]  That's exactly what he's referring to. Yeah
[31:06.080 --> 31:09.680]  You know and there's so many examples at the computer industry
[31:11.360 --> 31:14.400]  Apple had always sort of been on that spectrum. It's not like
[31:14.400 --> 31:16.400]  It's not like the iMac
[31:18.000 --> 31:20.000]  Was
[31:20.160 --> 31:22.160]  Unappley or or
[31:22.480 --> 31:25.000]  I'm not quite sure how to do I'm with you
[31:25.000 --> 31:30.480]  No, that is my point like Apple was a consumer company all the way through but this sort of like took it to to 100
[31:30.480 --> 31:34.680]  Yeah, and it was sort of like it it was like instead of feeling like oh
[31:34.680 --> 31:38.120]  This is a total shift and a new direction for the company
[31:38.120 --> 31:42.000]  It was like this is what Apple should have been doing for the last 10 years, right?
[31:42.000 --> 31:47.400]  Exactly, exactly and the original Mac from 1984 had that sort of effect, you know
[31:47.400 --> 31:50.920]  Yeah, I was just thinking about that like that's its true forebear, right?
[31:50.920 --> 31:57.760]  Like the Mac started out being this this sort of thing you want to put on a desk and you feel you see it and feel
[31:57.760 --> 32:03.560]  Happy and then it sort of devolved into well, there's you know, it took time but by the mid-90s
[32:03.560 --> 32:08.520]  It's just a bunch of baby boxes like everybody else and this was a return to what the Mac was supposed to be all along
[32:08.520 --> 32:15.360]  Yeah, yeah, exactly. And I feel like everybody who got it. I had that same feeling, you know, and it's
[32:15.880 --> 32:20.800]  You know you and you can't measure it. You can't put a number on it. It's not about specs
[32:20.800 --> 32:27.800]  It really is the antithesis of that and there's so many things in the quote-unquote liberal arts that are like that
[32:27.800 --> 32:29.800]  like what makes a
[32:30.360 --> 32:35.840]  Movie a great movie as opposed to a shitty movie and you know, you can't measure it
[32:35.840 --> 32:38.680]  You can't like it run run the movie
[32:39.720 --> 32:41.720]  Through a B test the movie you
[32:42.240 --> 32:47.800]  Put it through an algorithm and figure out, you know, have a piece of software say well, this is absolutely
[32:48.320 --> 32:54.280]  A classic piece of art or this one is a complete turd. You can't measure a novel
[32:55.120 --> 32:57.120]  Algorithmically, right? You can't you know
[32:57.640 --> 32:59.640]  It could be just as well
[32:59.640 --> 33:06.200]  It could be just as well printed with the same quality of paper. It could come right out of the same
[33:08.160 --> 33:13.160]  Printing press as a great novel and a piece of crap, you know
[33:15.200 --> 33:17.200]  Turd novel
[33:17.280 --> 33:23.200]  You you you just have to know it you it's something that you need to be a human being and you just feel it
[33:23.200 --> 33:30.360]  You know and the iMac definitely had that and and it was absolutely and everybody everybody
[33:30.840 --> 33:38.400]  Credits Johnny I've for that. I think it's one of the things that's interesting and it stems right from that 1998 era is that
[33:39.640 --> 33:41.360]  One of the things about Steve Jobs
[33:41.360 --> 33:46.720]  It's it's and it's hard to separate this as we do like a retrospective on Johnny Ives time at Apple
[33:46.720 --> 33:50.800]  It's you can't really separate his collaboration with Steve Jobs
[33:50.800 --> 33:57.080]  But one of the things about Steve Jobs that goes all the way back to the very earliest days
[33:57.200 --> 34:03.680]  Literally like when it was just him and Wozniak and he like short changed him on a check from Atari
[34:05.600 --> 34:08.080]  For a video game was that Steve Jobs
[34:08.920 --> 34:14.280]  Love him or hate him whatever you think about him. He tended to wanted to take a lot of the credit himself
[34:14.280 --> 34:16.520]  I mean, it was just his nature
[34:16.520 --> 34:23.400]  And I think it's very telling, you know, and and it was Steve Jobs who in his return to Apple
[34:25.000 --> 34:31.120]  Instituted a policy that in hindsight like if you only have been following Apple since sometime in the 2000s
[34:31.600 --> 34:33.440]  This would see this will seem crazy
[34:33.440 --> 34:40.080]  but prior to that Apple gave an entire a very large amount of credit to
[34:40.080 --> 34:47.360]  The engineers and designers who worked on things the about boxes for the operating system and for individual apps from Apple
[34:47.560 --> 34:54.680]  would list the people who worked on them and created them by name and and as a nerd who followed this stuff these you know,
[34:54.680 --> 34:56.960]  you you saw these names and and
[34:57.960 --> 35:01.880]  You know, you were like, wow, these these are this guy is great. Look at this guy
[35:01.880 --> 35:08.240]  He's worked on the finder for five years or it's the only guy who's who's made the entire
[35:08.240 --> 35:11.560]  File system, you know for for the Macintosh
[35:13.040 --> 35:15.040]  It was Jobs who came back and
[35:15.560 --> 35:17.360]  instituted this policy of hey
[35:17.360 --> 35:22.120]  we're not going to put anybody's names in these about boxes and ostensibly for the reason that
[35:22.560 --> 35:24.560]  He thought that they were getting you know
[35:25.080 --> 35:32.880]  Anti-poaching which I think is it's I've argued this like in public talks over the years publicly is seems like nonsense
[35:33.280 --> 35:35.280]  like it's it's not like
[35:35.280 --> 35:39.560]  because they they stopped putting engineer and designer names in about boxes that
[35:40.880 --> 35:48.320]  Recruiters in Silicon Valley didn't know how to get in contact with talented people at Apple to see if they would leave for another company
[35:48.320 --> 35:51.200]  You know, right jobs that's backroom deals to deal with nonsense
[35:53.920 --> 35:56.720]  Right job jobs cut backroom deals to deal with poaching, right?
[35:57.360 --> 36:02.520]  Exactly. That's that was the anti-poaching thing. Like he was he was concerned with poaching
[36:02.520 --> 36:08.120]  But I don't think the about box that he took a much more direct approach to dealing with it. Oh, that was also highly illegal
[36:08.120 --> 36:10.120]  Yeah, exactly
[36:11.800 --> 36:13.320]  But I
[36:13.320 --> 36:19.560]  Like from from the iMac onward there was never any lack of credit for Johnny I've you know it is
[36:19.560 --> 36:25.960]  You know the esteem that Steve Jobs held him in is clearly of the absolute highest regard
[36:26.440 --> 36:28.440]  That this is somebody who deserves
[36:28.440 --> 36:32.040]  Full-named credit as as
[36:32.920 --> 36:34.760]  an essential
[36:34.760 --> 36:40.760]  Apple employee who made this thing or spearheaded this thing spearheaded the team that made this thing
[36:42.040 --> 36:45.480]  Yeah, it no it's an it's an excellent point and it deserves
[36:45.480 --> 36:51.880]  I mean if there there's one guy that sort of deserves that sort of credit it is it is I've and you know the other thing
[36:51.880 --> 36:53.720]  That's interesting. I'm curious your thoughts about this
[36:53.720 --> 36:59.400]  It's it's striking to go back and look at those iMacs and that you know that translucent plastic and they're also colorful and you had
[36:59.400 --> 37:01.400]  the iBooks that were multicolored
[37:01.400 --> 37:09.080]  Sort of following the same sort of aesthetic and think about where Apple's hardware has sort of evolved to where it's a very
[37:09.080 --> 37:12.360]  Yes, there's the sort of like the secondary iPhone models that have colors
[37:12.360 --> 37:18.040]  But the you know the flagship models for a long time have been very sort of austere and and and cold almost
[37:18.040 --> 37:26.040]  And it's it's interesting to like why how is it that Apple and it took time like Apple sort of devolved in that direction
[37:26.040 --> 37:28.040]  Over over a while, but you know
[37:29.240 --> 37:32.360]  Maybe that's just the way that yeah, I think there's something I
[37:33.320 --> 37:37.640]  Think there's something to like the hardware just diminished in importance over time
[37:37.640 --> 37:40.040]  It's not that having great computers didn't matter
[37:40.040 --> 37:44.760]  But you think about something like the iPhone and the iPad where the screen is not being used
[37:44.760 --> 37:51.720]  But you think about something like the iPhone and the iPad where the screen and what you were doing and directly touching mattered so much more
[37:51.720 --> 37:56.200]  It was sort of appropriate that the hardware sort of fade away into the background
[37:56.600 --> 38:03.400]  and and I think that it's interesting to think about Ives career sort of in that context starting with the iMac where which was
[38:03.880 --> 38:09.000]  Hardware first carrying the company because of the hardware bright colorful what caught your eye?
[38:09.000 --> 38:16.440]  And then to see that sort of fade as everything else that took time sort of came to the surface. Yeah, that is a
[38:17.240 --> 38:19.240]  absolute great topic
[38:19.880 --> 38:25.160]  I'm gonna put a fork in it and come back to it after I tell you about our first sponsor
[38:25.720 --> 38:27.720]  Let me tell you about our friends at

[41:37.940 --> 41:40.420]  Yeah, I I do think that
[41:41.220 --> 41:46.300]  What you brought before the break there is an interesting point where the early?
[41:47.220 --> 41:50.260]  Johnny I've era, you know and and and it's so
[41:50.820 --> 41:58.020]  Funny and curious and interesting that I've and his industrial design team were already there at Apple
[41:58.860 --> 42:00.860]  when Steve Jobs
[42:00.860 --> 42:08.980]  Got there and and it's like what the you know, what the hell was the previous management doing with this team?
[42:08.980 --> 42:15.460]  No, they they somehow had the sensed. I have no idea how he lasted for what I think was it was there for five years
[42:15.460 --> 42:17.460]  Yeah jobs out there. It's it's wild
[42:18.980 --> 42:22.500]  So talented so ambitious and
[42:23.660 --> 42:28.060]  He had two products. The company was shipping had no, you know
[42:28.060 --> 42:33.620]  No, no real interest. I mean, I guess the Newton stuff maybe I don't know if you've been worked on the Newton stuff
[42:33.620 --> 42:36.060]  the Newton stuff was at least original but the
[42:36.820 --> 42:38.820]  Macintosh hardware of the time was just
[42:39.540 --> 42:42.060]  It was just the best-looking beige box
[42:43.580 --> 42:48.420]  Wasn't yep, it wasn't that interesting then the iMac ushers in this era of
[42:49.940 --> 42:51.940]  For lack of a better word trendiness
[42:52.580 --> 42:54.820]  You know and and stuff changed very quickly
[42:54.820 --> 42:58.620]  And you know in hindsight that that translucent plastic
[43:00.260 --> 43:03.660]  Whether it was the Bondi blue or you went remember when they first
[43:04.380 --> 43:10.940]  Expanded from that and they switched to like five colors. Yeah, remember the advertising I think they called him by fruit, right?
[43:10.940 --> 43:12.940]  It was like strawberry lime
[43:12.980 --> 43:14.980]  grape
[43:16.100 --> 43:18.620]  Which is so where it is to think about in retrospect
[43:18.620 --> 43:24.060]  Strawberry lime grape. What else was there? Was there a lemon blueberry?
[43:24.780 --> 43:28.220]  You know, they had like a new blue like a different shade of blue
[43:29.180 --> 43:34.860]  all of it looks very trendy and and it's like looking at old episodes of like
[43:35.340 --> 43:40.700]  Seinfeld or friends or whatever shows were on in the late 90s and you see you know the way that
[43:41.660 --> 43:45.580]  Hairstyles were different and clothing styles were different
[43:45.580 --> 43:51.020]  And for whatever reason in the 90s, we we all just bought clothes that were way too big
[43:51.020 --> 43:57.180]  Everybody brought like I'd like sweaters that you'd just buy clothes that were like two sizes is too big for you
[43:57.180 --> 44:01.340]  And you look at the TV shows and you see people dressed like that and you're like, what?
[44:01.980 --> 44:03.980]  Why is everybody wearing?
[44:03.980 --> 44:09.020]  Sweaters that are too big and the same way you look back at those, you know things and you think why?
[44:09.020 --> 44:11.660]  Why would you make a computer out of clear plastic?
[44:11.660 --> 44:15.820]  It it seems very trendy at the time. It was in sensation
[44:16.860 --> 44:18.860]  but then they did move to
[44:19.820 --> 44:24.540]  Design languages for various products that sort of have a timelessness, right?
[44:25.180 --> 44:28.780]  And I think that that titanium g4 power book
[44:29.740 --> 44:31.740]  Really was the start of that
[44:31.900 --> 44:33.900]  You know the it
[44:34.460 --> 44:35.980]  titanium
[44:35.980 --> 44:38.860]  There was problems with yeah, there's there's a lot of problems with titanium
[44:38.860 --> 44:43.020]  There was problems with yeah, the titanium wasn't a good idea
[44:43.100 --> 44:49.980]  But the the the the the language and the color sort of were exactly what you you still you still see today, right?
[44:50.200 --> 44:54.860]  Titanium was a problem it it it it didn't do well with some people's
[44:55.580 --> 45:02.860]  Like that the sweat and oil on your hands, you know, it would it it corroded on the palm rests for some people
[45:03.660 --> 45:05.340]  um
[45:05.340 --> 45:11.980]  But the basic look of it though is a lot like a modern macbook and the idea of hey
[45:12.380 --> 45:14.700]  Let's use a different material than plastic
[45:15.980 --> 45:22.780]  Was a fundamentally great idea right and now everybody the whole the whole world's moved to making stuff out of aluminum
[45:23.100 --> 45:25.660]  Yeah, no, everything was plastic all laptops were plastic back then
[45:26.860 --> 45:29.020]  I can't remember the last time i've seen a plastic
[45:29.580 --> 45:33.740]  Notebook now right it because everything's made out of aluminum now, you know carbon fibers
[45:33.740 --> 45:35.580]  And right those lines. Yeah
[45:35.580 --> 45:36.700]  it's
[45:36.700 --> 45:40.860]  All very interesting and and it a part of what made
[45:41.500 --> 45:47.100]  And makes you know and probably will make you know for years to come depending on you know, seeing what he works on
[45:47.980 --> 45:50.620]  johnny i've so interesting is uh
[45:51.340 --> 45:53.340]  He's truly truly deeply
[45:54.060 --> 45:57.200]  deeply interested in knowledgeable in materials
[45:58.140 --> 45:59.100]  and
[45:59.100 --> 46:05.820]  What they look like how you can make them how they're formed what their their uh, uh, rigidity is
[46:06.940 --> 46:08.060]  um
[46:08.060 --> 46:13.820]  And that just wasn't part of the pc industry at the time. Everything was just a piece of crap made out of plastic
[46:14.620 --> 46:22.640]  The other thing that's interesting too is sort of the the speed of iteration then, uh, because the the ipod was in 2001
[46:23.500 --> 46:28.540]  And you know, they were entering on that quite quickly and then I mean at the time when we were experiencing it
[46:28.540 --> 46:34.540]  It didn't feel like that that fast but if you go back like the ipod era era was only like six years, right?
[46:34.860 --> 46:39.660]  Yeah, and uh, and they'd come up with new ipods every year and then the mini came out and it seemed like a huge deal
[46:39.740 --> 46:41.740]  that was what 2005 like
[46:42.380 --> 46:44.220]  Yeah, it's so it's the same thing
[46:44.220 --> 46:48.220]  You talked about the jobs era apple where it actually it wasn't that long that he was gone
[46:48.540 --> 46:50.540]  But at the time it felt like it was forever
[46:50.540 --> 46:52.940]  and it was the same thing in the whole ipod era like it was
[46:53.900 --> 46:57.900]  It was actually quite short and and like half as long as the as the iphone era has been
[46:57.900 --> 47:00.460]  yeah, that's very true that the um
[47:01.580 --> 47:06.060]  The ipod era was very short, but it seemed long at the time
[47:06.540 --> 47:10.060]  I I very specifically remembered that it it
[47:10.860 --> 47:12.060]  it
[47:12.060 --> 47:13.980]  it coincided
[47:13.980 --> 47:16.380]  with apple's foray into
[47:17.020 --> 47:19.020]  Opening its own retail stores
[47:19.580 --> 47:26.060]  Which is one of the great claim chowder stories of all time because of how many people when they first said
[47:26.060 --> 47:32.620]  Hey, we're gonna make our own stores. We're like, hey if gate if gateway can't pull it off. There's no way apple can
[47:33.020 --> 47:37.020]  Yeah, it's amazing because I didn't I forgot about that. That was 2001 too. Yeah
[47:37.020 --> 47:42.300]  So 2001 apple watched itunes watched the watched the the titanium power book
[47:42.700 --> 47:49.180]  Launched the apple retail store launched the ipod and launched uh os 10 like the consumer version of os 10
[47:49.420 --> 47:52.620]  like it is like the most unbelievable year that a
[47:52.620 --> 47:57.580]  Computer company will ever have I mean again, not just the the amount of inequality of the products
[47:57.740 --> 48:02.080]  But sort of the long run impact of all those products is just astronomical
[48:03.900 --> 48:05.500]  It was like
[48:05.500 --> 48:06.300]  it but
[48:06.300 --> 48:13.100]  Apple's like a foray into retail was treated by the business press as like apple has decided to to
[48:13.580 --> 48:20.140]  Totally lost their minds. Yeah, but they've decided to put their corporate, uh bank balance on uh on red on a roulette table
[48:20.140 --> 48:24.300]  You know what? I mean? It was like this. Oh, no, they didn't give that they didn't give them that many chances
[48:24.300 --> 48:27.340]  No, yeah, it's like they picked one of the numbers 37
[48:27.980 --> 48:29.980]  Right, they put it all on 32
[48:30.300 --> 48:32.300]  Yeah, exactly
[48:33.340 --> 48:35.340]  But you know and you know that
[48:35.900 --> 48:42.380]  Johnny, iv has been instrumental in that too, right? I mean like the the tables at the apple stores are all
[48:42.940 --> 48:45.980]  You know custom designed by johnny's design team
[48:45.980 --> 48:53.980]  Johnny's design team, uh, and you know, steve jobs famously took an enormous interest in every single
[48:54.060 --> 48:56.300]  aspect of those stores, you know, uh
[48:57.160 --> 49:03.740]  Importing certain stone for the floors from a quarry in one town in italy
[49:04.540 --> 49:05.900]  uh
[49:05.900 --> 49:10.380]  All sorts of stuff like that details like that, but it's you know part of this
[49:10.380 --> 49:17.900]  Uh, just sort of design centric mentality that really took hold at apple, you know
[49:18.300 --> 49:23.260]  and again while jobs was gone, it's not like design didn't matter at apple, but
[49:24.300 --> 49:25.660]  it didn't
[49:25.660 --> 49:27.100]  it didn't
[49:27.100 --> 49:31.420]  It didn't surface in every single thing. They did in the way that it did after he got there
[49:32.380 --> 49:33.900]  Yep, absolutely
[49:33.900 --> 49:38.540]  And the I mean so go back to the ipods then so they're coming out with ipods every year
[49:38.540 --> 49:45.260]  and then the the sort of the iphone comes along and the you know, it's interesting they
[49:45.980 --> 49:49.900]  It's in retro like you're seeing this dramatic increase in complexity
[49:50.300 --> 49:53.020]  I think that's probably a big reason why the iphone sort of
[49:53.340 --> 49:57.580]  iteration speed was slower as far as industrial design because they they did the iphone one and the
[49:57.820 --> 50:05.020]  iphone 3g and then the 3gs was the same case and they they followed the s sort of yeah, you know versioning ever since and
[50:05.020 --> 50:08.620]  I I again, I i'm just very struck. I've been thinking about this all morning
[50:08.620 --> 50:10.700]  I had to wake up at three to write my daily update
[50:10.700 --> 50:17.820]  Uh, you were ready last night like to me this arc of johnny ive in in conjunction with what was happening at apple is so fascinating
[50:17.820 --> 50:22.140]  And this is another one where the you you talked a few minutes ago
[50:22.140 --> 50:27.020]  They could churn out sort of the the iMac quickly because using all sort of standard parts and you think about it
[50:27.020 --> 50:30.220]  It's a relatively large case and it can fit a lot of stuff in there very easily
[50:30.220 --> 50:37.580]  over time the complexity and sort of miniaturization of apple's products is also sort of going in this in this same direction where
[50:37.820 --> 50:40.460]  You're going from the iMac to the ipod and the ipod
[50:41.020 --> 50:43.420]  Looking back was a very sort of simple device
[50:43.420 --> 50:49.900]  But it was more challenging from a sort of manufacturing and production standpoint than an iMac would have been right and then and then you go
[50:49.900 --> 50:56.140]  From the the ipod to the ipod mini or the ipod nano and again the the challenges are sort of increasing in that regard
[50:56.140 --> 51:01.260]  The iphone takes that to a whole nother level because now I have to deal with antennas you have to deal with your cell reception
[51:01.580 --> 51:04.620]  All those sorts of things that go into that and you know
[51:05.260 --> 51:11.900]  This is sort of gonna weed. I think big picture to the questions about what comes after johnny ive, but the this the
[51:12.620 --> 51:15.580]  The challenge is you like you're not going to turn out an iphone
[51:15.900 --> 51:19.260]  It's not going to go from idea to out the door in eight months anymore
[51:19.260 --> 51:27.100]  It's just not possible anymore because the level of complexity has increased so much just as the importance of this of software
[51:27.340 --> 51:35.740]  And services has increased so much and again. I think this is where johnny ive like he was he was of outsized importance early on
[51:36.300 --> 51:39.440]  And became more important as a sort of collaborative
[51:40.380 --> 51:47.500]  Part of something much more complex later on and it's sort of a natural transition that happened as technology has changed
[51:47.500 --> 51:53.020]  It's I I the miniaturization thing is is an interesting
[51:54.060 --> 51:55.100]  angle
[51:55.100 --> 51:56.700]  and
[51:56.700 --> 51:58.860]  Just compare like you brought up
[51:59.580 --> 52:05.740]  You know just how how quickly the ipod changed from the original white?
[52:06.460 --> 52:09.980]  thick sort of deck of cards size one
[52:10.780 --> 52:12.780]  in 2001
[52:12.780 --> 52:14.780]  With a black and white screen
[52:14.780 --> 52:21.100]  to the mini which was a sensation to the nano which was
[52:22.220 --> 52:29.100]  A true sensation that's where it switched from a small tiny spinning hard drive to uh ssd storage
[52:29.660 --> 52:36.300]  Which allowed them to make it way smaller even though it was already like by far and away the best-selling mp3 player
[52:36.780 --> 52:38.780]  on the planet and they just
[52:39.100 --> 52:41.260]  Threw it away and said we're going to switch to something
[52:41.260 --> 52:45.740]  Much thinner and and using more expensive storage
[52:46.460 --> 52:49.340]  Just because we think this is the future and of course in hindsight
[52:50.540 --> 52:56.540]  You know selling these things with spinning hard disks seems archaic right it it was crazy
[52:56.540 --> 53:02.140]  But it was it's just not the sort of thing typical companies do but it all happened in five or six years
[53:02.380 --> 53:05.500]  And now just compare and contrast with apple watch
[53:06.140 --> 53:08.140]  Which has gotten
[53:08.140 --> 53:14.860]  At a technical level very much better since it debuted it is way faster if you buy a
[53:15.180 --> 53:22.620]  What's the current one series four if you buy the current apple watch it is way faster than the original apple watch it has?
[53:23.100 --> 53:24.380]  much
[53:24.380 --> 53:30.300]  Much longer battery life easily gets you entirely through a day no matter what you're doing with it
[53:31.020 --> 53:34.220]  How much you're using it how much you know fitness monitoring?
[53:34.220 --> 53:40.860]  You're doing you can easily get through a day whereas the original apple watch really struggled to get through a day on it on a single
[53:40.860 --> 53:42.860]  Charge so much faster
[53:43.500 --> 53:47.660]  But fundamentally like if you just saw somebody walking by you on the sidewalk
[53:47.660 --> 53:50.700]  Would you have any idea which apple watch they're wearing?
[53:50.860 --> 53:57.340]  You know the one the the five-year-old one the two-year-old one the three-year-old one one that they just bought yesterday
[53:57.580 --> 53:59.580]  I you wouldn't be able to tell it's
[53:59.580 --> 54:04.780]  hasn't really changed much from a
[54:05.180 --> 54:11.580]  Industrial design industrial design perspective just because it started it started at such a
[54:12.780 --> 54:15.820]  It's already as small as it could possibly be state
[54:16.700 --> 54:21.820]  Yeah, and I think I really started to feel this and notice this uh when it came to the ipad
[54:22.380 --> 54:26.140]  And um there is a in 2013. I wrote about I was talking to a friend of mine
[54:26.140 --> 54:30.620]  I was concerned about the ipad that apple sort of lost vision of what the ipad was supposed to be
[54:30.620 --> 54:36.780]  It remains in my opinion where apple misses steve jobs the most or the product that misses steve jobs the most in many respects
[54:37.180 --> 54:39.180]  But uh, we don't need to get into that here
[54:39.180 --> 54:45.420]  But but I went back to uh, I went back to watch the original ipad introduction then and I actually quoted this in my article today
[54:45.420 --> 54:50.940]  Because what was so interesting about the introduction was you had a johnny eye product video
[54:50.940 --> 54:56.940]  But johnny, I've actually barely talked in the video the vast majority of the video was scott forestall speaking
[54:57.500 --> 55:03.500]  And and if you go back to sort of the actual words that johnny i've said it's funny because johnny
[55:03.500 --> 55:09.420]  I've actually explained why he wasn't talking. Uh, and so i'm gonna actually quote what he says. He says, um,
[55:13.420 --> 55:18.220]  Uh, he said the face of the product is pretty much defined by the face of the product
[55:18.220 --> 55:23.740]  He said the face of the product is pretty much defined by a single piece of multi-touch glass and that's it
[55:23.980 --> 55:29.100]  There's no pointing device. There isn't even a single orientation. There's no up. There's no down. There's no right way of holding it
[55:29.340 --> 55:32.060]  I don't have to change myself to change the product. It fits me
[55:32.780 --> 55:33.900]  and
[55:33.900 --> 55:39.980]  It kind of struck me when I went back to read that like that was in some respects the end of the like
[55:40.700 --> 55:44.780]  The johnny i've driving force era right like the yes
[55:44.780 --> 55:51.420]  He he designed the ipad and it came out but there was something fundamentally different about that device where yes being thin being light
[55:51.660 --> 55:55.180]  Being something that felt good in your hands was important and the current ipads right now
[55:55.180 --> 55:59.900]  I think is the best industrial design that apple's ever done. They're just absolutely incredible but
[56:01.420 --> 56:06.220]  It ceased to be the absolute driving force for why this product mattered why it was important to you
[56:06.220 --> 56:11.740]  Why was something you wanted to use in a very sort of stark difference from the go back to the iMac, for example
[56:11.740 --> 56:18.940]  Like it switched to this world where the importance of the software started to overtake the importance of the hardware and you would have discussions
[56:18.940 --> 56:25.500]  Would you rather have a thinkpad with os 10 or would you rather have you know a mapbook pro with windows and and like?
[56:26.380 --> 56:29.980]  That the importance of which mattered sort of flipped over time
[56:30.380 --> 56:35.340]  and I think that uh, you know, it's interesting because in retrospect that that was about the time that
[56:36.300 --> 56:40.620]  Whatever happened to scott forestall happened. Uh, there was a striking anecdote in the information
[56:40.620 --> 56:44.140]  I'm, not sure if you read it yet where they they they had this sort of chilling
[56:44.440 --> 56:51.340]  Addict of scott forestall's team meeting and johnny i'm attending and they're like where's scott and johnny's like he's not attending or he scott
[56:51.340 --> 56:53.020]  Won't be here anymore
[56:53.020 --> 56:59.260]  But um, but but it was like for for him to matter as a designer to apple in some respects
[56:59.800 --> 57:05.900]  Necessitated taking over software as he did when forestall left just because software was becoming so much more important than the hardware
[57:07.100 --> 57:09.100]  That is uh, that should be
[57:09.100 --> 57:13.980]  The topic for the second half of the show is is the the sort of
[57:15.340 --> 57:17.340]  Post steve jobs
[57:17.980 --> 57:23.740]  Johnny, i've era. Yeah, I think oh, yeah post post post jobs. I I do think you're right
[57:23.740 --> 57:25.980]  I think you're making a very keen point that
[57:26.700 --> 57:28.700]  I don't think that
[57:28.700 --> 57:32.460]  I think whatever problems personality wise i've had with
[57:33.580 --> 57:35.900]  forestall and and again apple is so
[57:35.900 --> 57:37.980]  apple is so
[57:37.980 --> 57:39.500]  insular
[57:39.500 --> 57:44.300]  And people even when they leave the company tend not to talk about it
[57:44.460 --> 57:48.940]  we don't know that much, you know, and and I have sources and
[57:49.820 --> 57:51.500]  I'm a little bit
[57:51.500 --> 57:54.860]  juiced into some of the behind the scenes stuff. Uh,
[57:55.500 --> 57:56.940]  but
[57:56.940 --> 58:03.920]  We just don't know much but I don't think in fact, I would wager on it that it wasn't a situation
[58:03.920 --> 58:05.920]  where
[58:06.540 --> 58:08.240]  Simplistically
[58:08.240 --> 58:10.240]  johnny, i've
[58:10.240 --> 58:11.600]  saw
[58:11.600 --> 58:12.780]  that
[58:12.780 --> 58:18.480]  Software was the defining feature of these products now that their most important products were
[58:19.600 --> 58:24.800]  Just pieces of glass with with an interface on them, you know the iphone and the ipad
[58:25.920 --> 58:30.800]  And therefore thought I need to take control of this because if I don't have control of the software, what am I controlling?
[58:30.800 --> 58:35.920]  Right. I'm just controlling what what what the volume buttons look like on the side of an ipad
[58:36.640 --> 58:41.840]  I don't think it was that I I really think that they did have a serious conflict. I think that you know
[58:42.480 --> 58:44.800]  There were stories that he wouldn't take meetings with
[58:45.360 --> 58:49.920]  He wouldn't go to he johnny wouldn't go to meetings. I think and and bob mansfield
[58:50.000 --> 58:54.900]  I think had the same policy that he just he just wouldn't go to a meeting with scott forestall
[58:55.600 --> 58:58.320]  Uh, which is you know, not a good situation to have
[58:58.320 --> 59:04.960]  It seems unhealthy. It does not seem healthy. No, I agree with you. I don't i'm not saying it was intentional but the effect was that
[59:05.520 --> 59:07.520]  i've's
[59:07.520 --> 59:12.320]  Realm of influence had diminished by virtue of the way the products evolved right and then
[59:12.880 --> 59:14.880]  him taking over software sort of
[59:15.760 --> 59:23.280]  It was very much a new era. It was a new era for him personally and it dramatically increased sort of his influence on apple
[59:23.440 --> 59:25.440]  for for that period
[59:25.440 --> 59:27.440]  Um
[59:28.240 --> 59:30.240]  Yeah, totally I I also think
[59:31.200 --> 59:36.320]  And I want to I want to say this while it's still on my mind. Uh, I know we're skipping around years now
[59:37.200 --> 59:41.200]  Quite a bit, but it wouldn't be the talk show if we weren't skipping around randomly
[59:41.760 --> 59:46.880]  Uh, I made the point a couple minutes ago that if you just look at the apple watch hardware
[59:47.280 --> 59:54.320]  You really can't tell the series zero from the series one to the series two. I mean the series four has a slightly different
[59:54.320 --> 59:56.320]  Uh
[59:56.460 --> 01:00:00.720]  Profile it's almost not even a different form factor. It's just sort of a a
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:06.160]  Closer to your wrist profile, uh, it is to me a nicer looking
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.040]  round rectangle
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:12.560]  But it is still like so it's still a black rectangle on your wrist
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:16.800]  And it you really have to you you still can't spot the difference
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:21.620]  Just walking by somebody the one thing though that you can definitely
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:23.600]  spot
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.760]  Just at a glance when you see oh
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:32.560]  She's wearing an apple watch the one thing that you definitely can notice are the the watch bands
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:39.520]  and you know and they apple, you know, and part of it is, you know, they they make money selling these bands and
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:42.160]  um
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:45.120]  So they do it just just for the purely financial reason of hey
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:50.400]  Let's you know every six months we're going to come out with a new, you know, every fall and every spring we're going to refresh
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:53.280]  The apple watch bands that you can buy
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.520]  um
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:00.080]  You know and it's like any kind of fashion type thing, you know any kind of clothing
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:05.600]  And apple definitely recruited a lot of people from the fashion industry when they got into the watch
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:10.080]  Business and they definitely work that way, you know
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:15.440]  They work the way that the the same way that new clothing lines come out every fall and spring
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.640]  but I think that uh
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:23.680]  I I know I I know for a fact that one of the things that johnny i've
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:28.880]  Was most interested in with the watch was designing the bands and straps
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.800]  Which sounds a little uh?
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:41.360]  Not petty but it gets back to that argument with the original iMac where the appeal had nothing to do with the technical specs
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.200]  right like
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.200]  the idea that
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:52.400]  That apple's chief design officer was spent spent an inordinate amount of time obsessing over an array
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.800]  of watch bands
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.520]  For what is ostensibly a tech product?
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:02.960]  Doesn't sound like the way a tech a computer company should work
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:10.640]  but it's absolutely part of a huge part to me of the appeal of apple watch as a product line and I
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.680]  Absolutely think it's a huge part of what?
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.040]  of what
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.040]  uh
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:21.680]  What drove johnny i've's interest in apple watch as a product
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:28.560]  Yeah, and there's there's something there's a there's a fundamental trade-off that comes from working for a company like apple, which is
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:34.340]  The designs that you make and the decisions that in all those things you get unlimited resources
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:40.880]  And like the work that you do lands in the hands of hundreds of millions of people. So like the the the
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:44.720]  The the resources and the impact are absolutely massive
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:49.120]  But there are just a massive number of constraints that come with that
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:53.200]  You're constrained by the technology you're constrained by having to meet a price point
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:58.720]  You're constrained by all like all these working in a big bureaucracy and having to deal with the scott forestalls of the world
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:03.280]  like there's all these constraints that come with it and for it always sort of
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:09.920]  surprised me in some respect that i've lasted as long as he did because if you're sort of like a designer and you just have
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.600]  The the need to create and the desire to do lots of things and there's no surprise
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:17.440]  He would be designing christmas trees or designing chairs or whatever sort of side products
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:24.720]  He would do because how can you how can you design so few things for such a long time when right?
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:24.960]  you know
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:30.720]  it's it's kind of a very stifling place to be and you do it because the impact and you do it because of the
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:35.200]  resources you do it because you love your team and you and you care about the people you work with you do it because of
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:38.000]  Steve jobs and all those sorts of things but at the end of the day
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.560]  At the end of the day like, you know, honestly if you look at it from that perspective
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:48.800]  It's almost surprising. He lasted as long as he did and hell yeah, make some watch bands like, you know, it's it's it's fun
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:56.080]  It's it's fun in a way that designing the actual case of the watch or designing the next version of the iphone just will
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:58.880]  Could never could never be yeah
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:00.400]  uh
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:04.880]  Let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor and i'm gonna go and then and then i'm going to
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:06.720]  go into a
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.720]  a humble brag
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:09.840]  anecdote
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.120]  uh
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.200]  So put a pen I get one you you get one

[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.400]  So when the original apple watch was announced
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:39.920]  Uh, I think it was a september event. I don't know if that was or was it october
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:44.000]  I guess they wouldn't have announced it at the same event as the iphone. Yeah, it was a separate event
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.080]  No, no, it was the same event as the iphone. Oh was it was interesting because it was the the same event
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:54.560]  They announced the iphone 6 which ended up being this massively important product and apple paid barely any attention to that, right?
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:57.200]  it was uh
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:07.040]  Yeah, I guess it was the same event, uh, it was at the san jose, uh, um the theater there in san or not the convention center
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.400]  No, no, it was it wasn't the convention center
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:16.480]  It was some sort of it was they don't only had one event there ever before previously and they put up that huge tent
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:20.800]  That was to try out all the apple watches and all that sort of thing. They had all these celebrities coming in
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:25.280]  Yeah, it was at dianza college or something. That's right. That's what it was, right?
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:31.040]  It wasn't the event that was at the california theater in san jose. That was that was a different one. Uh,
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:35.840]  That because that's where I have my live show now at wwdc. No, it was at dianza college
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:41.440]  Uh, which I think is closing or something or the at least the flint center. I think it's called. That's right. That's right
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:44.400]  That's right. Um, but yeah, they made a giant
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:50.400]  They they literally created an entire building, uh temporary pop-up building
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:57.360]  To have all of the uh, you know, they yeah and they had celebrities there. I remember I was across the table
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:01.920]  Looking at these watches from uh, gwen stefani and I was like
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:07.200]  And I was like like how is this possible? Why am I here? Why am I here?
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:13.040]  Uh across a table of apple watches from gwen stefani this does speaking of the late 90s
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.640]  It just doesn't seem this didn't seem like a place where I would end up being
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:18.880]  um
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.880]  but after that event, uh
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:23.120]  I had a
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:28.880]  Briefing and they didn't say, you know, apple's very even when you're you know, you have like a press briefing
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:31.600]  They don't tell you they still don't they don't tell
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.360]  Me at least who the briefings are with they'll just say hey, we have a we have a uh briefing
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:41.840]  scheduled for you at uh 115 does that work and i'll be you know, I
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:46.000]  What am I doing? I keep my whole day out, you know available after these events
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:51.200]  So i'm like, yeah, no matter what time they tell me i'm like, yeah, but they always ask so they're very very polite
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.800]  And you know say like would 115 work for you. Does 130 work?
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:59.440]  130 work, uh, but they don't tell you who who it's with or what it's about. But uh,
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:06.480]  The day that they announced the apple watch I had a one-on-one half hour briefing with johnny. Ive
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.040]  uh
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:14.240]  And I I don't think it was the first time I had spoken with him I had a few others
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:15.920]  uh
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:19.280]  Some of them I think I still shouldn't talk about because they were off the record
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.600]  um
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:26.640]  But the one with the watch was great. It was so interesting. I had a full half hour
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.520]  Just me and johnny. I've in a room
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:32.160]  with all of the
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:37.280]  Prototype apple watches that were still not going to ship for six or seven months. Uh
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:42.720]  But we spent the whole half hour talking about watch bands
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:49.520]  And the other thing we talked about the only other thing we talked about was the packaging
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.520]  For the edition model
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.040]  You know the twenty thousand dollar gold. Yep, gold one
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:58.320]  Which every you know?
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:03.200]  I think we have to talk about that watch because I do I do think that the twenty thousand dollar gold
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.920]  apple watch edition
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  is
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:16.160]  It's not important to apple's history, but I think it's essential to understanding johnny ive and his role at the company
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:20.080]  His role at the company, but we didn't even talk about the watches. We didn't talk about the gold
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:23.200]  I mean they were there and we you know, he's sort of like, you know, it was like look at this
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:24.000]  This is nice
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:29.280]  And uh, but for the most part we just talked about the bands and we talked about the box that the edition one came in
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:32.180]  Actually, we talked about all the boxes, but the addition one in particular
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:37.040]  Really did have an extraordinary box and package. It was really nice
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:40.720]  But then we just spent half an hour talking about the way watch bands
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:45.600]  Clasp and close and the different, you know different ways that you can do things. Uh,
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:47.520]  and
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:48.800]  you know
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:54.000]  I had met him before it is definitely wasn't the first time I met him and he knows that he knew that I was a
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.400]  You know like a watch fan, uh
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:01.200]  And I knew that he was i'd seen that he had like, uh, you know
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:05.040]  Like uh ottomir pique. I forget how you pronounce that brand
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:09.840]  Uh before apple watch came out. He always had like a very nice some very nice watches
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:16.640]  but we talked about like the ways that the clasps on like roll classic like stainless steel rolexes and
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.040]  uh, you know
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.640]  $30,000
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:22.640]  swiss watches had
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:27.520]  sort of antiquated janky closures and it's like look at how nice this is and
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.360]  the
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:36.320]  They really did and I remember talking to uh, ben climber who is the founder of hodinky
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:40.320]  I know, you know hodinky the h o d i n k e e
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.240]  uh
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:44.160]  hodinky is a
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:46.160]  for those of you who don't know is a
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:49.040]  It's a great website devoted to watches
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:55.440]  Uh, and it's all pretty much all they write about is just what the watches and the watch industry and high-end watches
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.280]  uh
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:00.400]  I remember talking to ben climber about it and ben climber, you know
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:05.920]  Didn't because he was a total he's a true watch guy and he's coming from the world of mechanical and
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.920]  automatic watches
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:15.540]  His initial take the day the day that they announced all this stuff and we had the hand after the hands-on area
[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:16.900]  um
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:21.220]  He was just like blown away by the quality of apple's watch straps and bands
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:25.700]  he was like, you know, they've really raised they've they've raised the stakes here and sort of uh,
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:32.500]  Sent like a lob like a grenade over to switzerland and told, you know, the entire watch industry get your shit together
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:36.980]  You know, you guys have been sitting on your laurels for decades on watch straps
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:42.500]  That that's what johnny. I've and I talked to we didn't talk about health stuff. We didn't talk about this interface
[01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:46.260]  we didn't talk about we talked about nothing but watch straps and
[01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:50.580]  I think that was it. It's what I wanted to talk about, you know, and
[01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:52.740]  because I
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:59.380]  Just let him go on what he's interested in but in hindsight the the key thing I take away from that and I
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:05.220]  I and I think it goes to whatever it is. He's going to do going forward
[01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:13.060]  Is that a good watch strap is a good watch strap 20 years from now and it would have been a good watch strap
[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:15.700]  20 or 30 years ago
[01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:17.220]  whereas
[01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:19.220]  the actual apple watch itself
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:25.140]  Technically is you know, the one you're wearing today is going to be a relic in 10 years
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:29.620]  Yeah, and I really feel like at the heart of it that is
[01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:33.300]  Why he's leaving apple
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:35.860]  Is yeah
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:42.420]  I think he's tired of developing designing things that are only going to be relevant for three years
[01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:49.060]  At best at best and wants to be designing things that will be
[01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:52.100]  relevant forever
[01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:57.860]  Yeah, I think I mean I I think it all it's the same thing as wanting to just do different stuff like the the
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:05.060]  What drives someone to be creative and and again, there's so many constraints, you know within you know
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:08.580]  you the other thing I wonder is i'm curious with the um, you know
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:15.140]  This whole idea my point that I started the very very beginning that I feel like this kind of started for you know
[01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:19.780]  Four years ago where uh, you know right after the the watch had launched
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:22.900]  Right after the the watch had launched that they came out
[01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:25.620]  He's gonna be again chief design officer and not manage anyone
[01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:28.820]  And if you're not managing anyone, you're not leading the organization
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:33.140]  like you like yes, they can come and talk to you and consult with you, but like the
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:37.300]  It's intense being an executive for apple is extremely intense
[01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:40.420]  And if you are not in the middle of it in the thick of it every day
[01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:44.980]  You are not a part of it. It's just like there it's not a it's not a malicious thing
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:51.460]  It's just impossible to to be that and you know as that's why I thought as soon as that announcement came out that you know
[01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:53.540]  He's like he's on his way out
[01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:58.500]  But at the same time, you know, particularly then apple couldn't really afford to to lose him
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:03.940]  So one he got to work on apple park which fits in your point about something that's going to last a long time
[01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:07.300]  Right that is going to be meaningful is is something completely new
[01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:11.060]  Try out, you know creative juices and all those sorts of things
[01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:15.460]  But also it was good for apple because apple couldn't afford the the the pr
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:23.860]  Of losing him at that time. That was when the questions, you know, can tib cook weed apple can apple survive without steve jobs like
[01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:26.980]  johnny, iv was the the sort of
[01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:34.180]  The the guy that people who never understood how apple worked and presumed once steve jobs in a way that apple would be over
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:39.140]  They pinned their hopes on johnny. I've he was a totem. He was something that you know this idea that apple
[01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:46.100]  Could could systematically produce great products was still hadn't completely taken hold particularly once jobs jobs had left
[01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:53.620]  And so apple needed him to be there even if as I would contend he was not there day to day and and uh, and you know
[01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:57.380]  And I think that that all all this sort of fits fits together
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:01.300]  Yeah, I think it does. I totally do. Um
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:07.780]  Well, I wonder if apple would have lost him sooner too if they hadn't given him the software
[01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:13.540]  Because to to the point I was making before right? What's the hardware like just the what you can actually do was sort of diminishing
[01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:19.860]  Like software gave him something new to do and which kept him around and then apple park gave him something new to do
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:26.660]  Which which kept him around and now there's not anything sort of new to do and and but it's okay because they've spent the last four
[01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:31.940]  Years sort of easing easing away from from where he was in the organization and frankly
[01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:37.060]  I don't think anything's gonna really change for apple. Um, I I think that to the extent that
[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:41.460]  To the extent that I actually think it could potentially be a positive
[01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:43.940]  I mean, I think you look at something like the back book or some of the other
[01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:48.660]  or even ios's design, uh, I think there was a maybe an
[01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:56.580]  Went too far too much in being beautiful and too little in sort of how it works. Yep, and you know, which was which happens
[01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:59.060]  uh
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:00.660]  Well
[01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:02.660]  I think that's a great point
[01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:04.740]  Here's an alternate question is
[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:08.260]  Would would would johnny. I've have left sooner
[01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:11.060]  or stayed longer
[01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:14.900]  If steve jobs hadn't died if steve jobs were still
[01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:16.820]  around
[01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:21.860]  Still ceo or maybe you know, if if he had, you know changed to chairman or whatever
[01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:27.140]  But if jobs if jobs were still around would johnny. I've have left sooner or would he still be there because
[01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:33.460]  The that collaboration would would fulfill him in a way that without without jobs
[01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:36.900]  Without jobs as his collaborator. He's he's no longer
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:39.140]  satisfied
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:46.500]  I that's fascinating. I think he would still be there just because you got the sense that there was such a bond and a and a
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:52.980]  Connection there that that would trump everything but uh, but yeah, it's it's a fascinating question to consider
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:56.100]  well, and the other factor the x factor is that
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.420]  Clearly
[01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:02.420]  one of steve jobs's
[01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:04.400]  numerous
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:07.360]  genius talents was a sort of
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:10.320]  Pied piper
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:13.760]  Ability to convince people to do what he wanted them to do
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.640]  So like johnny might have thought, you know
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:20.400]  Three four years ago in the world where steve jobs is still around like I think i'm done
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:23.840]  I think i'm after apple park i'm going to you know
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:29.360]  i'm gonna leave the company and he's gonna go tell steve jobs this and steve jobs would
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:35.440]  That he'd walk out of steve jobs's office after signing like uh an agreement. They'll stay for 20 years
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.920]  Right, right exactly
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.760]  It's you know, like that could have happened. So who knows but it's an interesting question
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:46.800]  I do think you're right that without getting software under his his his domain
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:53.520]  He he probably would have left sooner because I think that I I think I think you make it's a very key observation that there's just
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:56.240]  There was it without software
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:19:01.120]  Under his umbrella and direct control. There was just so much less to do
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:04.240]  right, I mean it's
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.240]  you know
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.320]  It it's fascinating
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:12.240]  To to look at you look at all these products. Well what?
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:15.280]  One of the you know, you how do you look at the products?
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:20.480]  I've got the I took out that uh, you know the coffee table book that they put out a few years ago
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:23.280]  um
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:28.560]  And which probably goes in some sort of category with the edition watches if we want to discuss well, but
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.720]  I I do think I like I really want to give you full credit for
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:41.520]  Going back five years or was it 2015 when they announced this chief design officer and that you you put forward
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:45.120]  I think I think this is the beginning of the end. He's gonna he's gonna leave
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  And I think that the time frame
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:53.440]  Frame that has happened since qualifies as being you being right, you know that he's out
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:56.000]  But I don't think it was as clear of a plan
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:00.480]  I think that if he really knew exactly what he how long he was going to stay
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:07.200]  I think that that coffee table book wouldn't have come out until now like it it it it in hindsight
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:13.440]  It came out a couple of years too early because now there's a few products that are clearly of the johnny ivy era that
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000]  Didn't come out
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000]  Before the book was printed
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:22.080]  You know what I mean like that the book is such an interesting
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:26.580]  It's I it's such an interesting
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:33.760]  Product and again, I think you're right that it's it is sort of along the lines of the gold edition watches. Uh,
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:39.540]  You know that it is it wasn't meant to sell in large quantities. It's super expensive
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:45.140]  Uh, well it exists because johnny wants it to exist. Yeah, I think is is what I was driving at but every you know,
[01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:49.140]  I don't know and it's like I doubt they're gonna make another version of it
[01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:55.300]  But I kind of wish that they would make a new one and just put you know, just for completeness sake put
[01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:57.860]  put the last like two or three years of
[01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:01.700]  Of products in there. Uh, well, I mean honestly though
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:05.620]  I i'm not sure how much how involved he really was. I mean
[01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:10.020]  It's it's is the apple watch the apple watch is in the book. Yeah, um
[01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:16.900]  But I I really question how much johnny did after the apple watch to be totally honest. Uh, you know the
[01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:23.460]  To my view. I mean, I don't again this is total speculation and conjecture. No, no short information
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:28.980]  But my sense is he shipped the apple watch. It was extremely draining
[01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:34.260]  I remember you know you discussed the time how tired he seemed that new yorker profile came out
[01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:39.540]  And and I think he was done like I think he switched to apple park and honestly, I I don't you know
[01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:42.900]  You mentioned in your post this week, which I think was the one was a great post
[01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:47.300]  I think is the one point I disagreed with that we're going to see johnny ive's impact for the next five years
[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:53.220]  I don't think so. I I think that we've seen it and I think it's over like and and that's okay like
[01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:59.860]  If you think about the watch was such a natural sort of end point for him like it was the way he's expressed
[01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:04.580]  He's expressed this interest in wearables this idea of things that are on your body
[01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:09.220]  Like a lot of his discussion outside of apple has been on this sort of topic
[01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:11.780]  He's talked about health care things and those
[01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:16.340]  You know his dad was you know in the hospital and talk about how poorly designed, you know
[01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:21.380]  That's those sorts of things were and it makes sense that like that was sort of that was it that that was
[01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:25.700]  That was what he went out on and you know, if you think about something, you know
[01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:31.620]  And it's right time to go out because what's next let's say the ar glasses are probably next like if you want to
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:33.460]  Ship, they are glasses
[01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:35.780]  You have to it's going to be a huge slog
[01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:40.740]  You have to be there through shipping and then you have to start the process of the unwinding process
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:44.580]  That he spent the last four years doing so if he if he commits to the next product
[01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:46.660]  He's committing for like the next 10 years
[01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:50.820]  and whereas you know someone of i've stature and the importance that he has in the
[01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:55.960]  mythology of apple and and what goes into what making apple apple and the stock price and all the and you know
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:23:00.840]  Can apple survive without steve jobs like he's not someone that could walk out the door when he's done
[01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:03.080]  He had to have this wind down process
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:07.160]  That's just the price of being who he is and the importance he is to apple
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:11.400]  And I think it makes much more sense to think you know what he shipped the watch
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:16.440]  He stepped back from data responsibilities. He spent all his time on apple park apple park is now done
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:23.960]  and and the the industrial design team has been able to get used to working without him for several years now and it's just
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:29.080]  Like again, it was shocking. But if you if you actually walk through step by step everything happened
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:31.160]  It makes it makes sense. He had nothing more to do
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:35.320]  he had done what he wanted to do all the jobs were done the team was handed off and
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:40.440]  You know, it's almost like it'd be a surprise if he stayed I think it's a little less
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:43.240]  binary and a little bit more
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:49.960]  Uh gray, uh, what his role has been. I don't think it's as much as well. He checked out a few years ago
[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:57.080]  And what but before that he was super checked in and doing it I to make a very
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:00.280]  Maybe it's not that rough of an analogy
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:04.360]  I I I think back to
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:09.400]  The fact that george lucas didn't direct
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:14.280]  empire strikes back or return of the jedi, but specifically empire which is
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:17.000]  To me the best of the star wars movies
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:25.560]  Because yeah, he almost had like a by all accounts had almost had like a nervous breakdown directing star wars to get star wars out
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:28.280]  just just because it was so much work and
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:32.520]  Just exhausting and being the director was so much
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:37.880]  But it wasn't like well, he's not going to direct the next director
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:42.040]  He's not going to direct the next movie, but it's not like he wasn't involved, right?
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:47.800]  It was like, you know, he he still wrote the screenplay and and it it is very george lucasy
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:50.600]  It's it's if you know anything about george lucas's
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:53.400]  work
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:25:01.480]  You can't watch the empire strikes back and not see how george lucasy it is, but he wasn't the director and I think that
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:09.560]  That over the last five years or so and putting putting the flag at apple watch is possibly a good marker
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:11.880]  You know that he moved
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:18.920]  It's not like he checked out and hasn't been involved but he's more of an executive producer than the director of of
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:23.000]  Things absolutely. I know I I completely agree with that. Yeah, so it's not like, you know
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:28.120]  He walked off into the sunset and was gone like but it was like instead of driving the car
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:31.160]  Yeah, he was like the the crew chief, right?
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:35.560]  And and maybe you know, I really do think you know
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:43.240]  Maybe was more of like what steve jobs had always been right where jobs wasn't the designer
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:45.960]  Who was carving?
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:48.280]  uh
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:54.600]  You know physically carving a model of what this piece of hardware might look like so that you could hold it in your hand
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:59.480]  And feel the size and feel the corners or or directly driving
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:04.680]  The 3d printing machine that would generate these, you know, like a prototype or something like that
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:06.120]  um
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:12.360]  But he was obviously the person who was like this or this first one a not b
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:18.840]  A and give me 10 more versions of a that are slightly different and uh get them to me by next week
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:24.040]  I think johnny. I've had has been in that sort of role for a while
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:28.120]  Yeah, no, I think I think I think that's right. I think it's a great analogy to jobs like you know jobs
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:33.400]  Was not a he was not actually designing the products. He was the editor
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:37.640]  uh that was you know making those decisions and and you know is is
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:42.200]  You know to go back to sort of the edition and things like that. It was probably uh
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:48.440]  It was probably a good thing. Uh, you know, like if you're the designer and the editor you know
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:53.240]  You tend to not edit yourself very well. Yeah, and uh, which again the edition is
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:59.340]  I'm, glad the edition exists because it's kind of funny that it existed at one point and we can remember all the speculation
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:03.080]  About obviously the cost and figuring out how much gold was in them
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:07.800]  Like it's a funny sort of footnote in apple history that ultimately doesn't matter that much
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:14.840]  Uh, but it is an example of why everyone needs an editor. I think it didn't hurt them because they weren't counting on it
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:22.120]  It wasn't like their their, you know, tim cook's spreadsheet with how are we going to make money selling digital watches?
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:27.640]  Involved selling a large quantity of the twenty thousand dollar gold ones, right? Like
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:31.100]  I think that whatever their even most optimistic
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:40.600]  Take on how many of those were going to sell was very small. It was a statement though, right? It was it wasn't about
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:43.720]  You know
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:47.480]  Making a gazillion dollars. That's what the the aluminum ones are for
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:48.600]  uh
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:51.640]  the ones that they knew everybody was going to buy and they're sort of the
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:55.880]  Have always been and should be considered the default apple watches
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:03.080]  Um, but doing the ones in gold and then in subsequent years the ones in ceramic were statements
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:06.360]  But the gold to start with the gold ones like the ceramic ones to me
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:11.720]  Uh, because they were a lot cheaper. I think they were like what two thousand dollars. I mean no a thousand
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:15.900]  A thousand thousand dollars. They were they were great by the way. Oh fantastic
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:21.800]  I did not own I think they were the best version of the apple watch were those white ceramic ones. I absolutely agree. Uh,
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:24.840]  I I and
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:29.000]  It's funny because I think I was just about to say I kind of wish I had bought one and then I think well
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:32.360]  Wait, no, it would actually be old enough now that I wouldn't be wearing it
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:37.240]  Anyway, but I and they they as my wife found out they break when you drop them
[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:42.440]  Yeah, well, that's the problem with ceramic but you know, it was an experiment with materials
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:49.960]  They did brag, you know when they had the gold one they talked about how they like, you know, uh engineered their own gold alloy
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:54.520]  Like but part of that too is that johnny i've
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:29:02.760]  And I think it's essential to understand this it's like I don't want this discussion to make it sound like he was concerned only with
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:06.200]  fashion and surface matters
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:09.740]  Uh quite the opposite. He he he's absolutely
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:13.080]  One of the world's leading
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:20.120]  Minds on like material science like he he's absolutely so
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:28.200]  Incredibly knowledgeable about a lot of the actual technical factors that go into products. Here's a story I heard a couple months ago
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:30.840]  This is this came to light
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:33.240]  when the
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:36.360]  samsung galaxy fold was
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:39.080]  shipped to reviewers
[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:43.160]  And within 24 hours like half of them broke, right?
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:48.520]  Yeah, like peeling off. It was like six weeks ago. I don't know six or seven weeks ago something like that and it
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:56.680]  um, but back when samsung announced it at at at some kind of press conference in like early february, you know
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.220]  Three three months two three months before they shipped these things to reviewers
[01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:07.180]  And somebody who works at apple on software, uh had a meeting with johnny to discuss
[01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:12.060]  I don't I don't actually even know what they were actually discussing but it came up
[01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:14.780]  and he said and and
[01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:22.080]  This story was relayed to me after the galaxy fold shipped to reviewers and turned out to be a complete debacle
[01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:25.040]  But said the day that they announced it in february
[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:32.640]  He had a meeting, you know, his team had met with johnny. I've and johnny. I've explained in technical detail exactly why it was going to fail
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:37.920]  And said, oh there's I don't know why they announced that we've looked into that. That's it's you know
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:47.360]  There's and just went into great technical detail why folding an oled screen like that was going to be fragile and wouldn't work
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:49.520]  it just
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:51.520]  It really really
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:55.120]  And I thought it was such a great example of
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:31:00.240]  Understood, you know that the the motto design is how it works, right?
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:02.960]  Not just what it looks like
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:04.080]  um
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:11.600]  Yeah, no, it's just like the accumulated knowledge and experience that you get from living and breathing and experimenting over
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:13.680]  You know decades like that
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:19.440]  You can look at something like that and immediately know what the issues are and what like what will matter and what will not work
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:23.600]  All right. Let me take one last break here. Thank our third and final sponsor and we let's talk about the uh,
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:30.720]  Afterwards, let's talk about this the organizational structure that apple is putting design into going forward
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:37.280]  Uh and any other things that pop into your mind ben, uh, but let me thank squarespace. Oh, I love squarespace
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:42.080]  Look squarespace is the all-in-one website hosting platform
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:46.560]  Everything you need to do to host your own website registering domain names
[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:53.200]  Picking a template customizing the design adding features you do it all in squarespace
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:55.840]  They have a great new
[01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:58.480]  ios app
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:00.400]  for
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:04.080]  Modifying controlling running your website from your phone from your ipad
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:06.160]  great
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:13.520]  On the desktop, which is where they really got started and where the main squarespace interface is you just do everything right there in the browser
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:18.960]  Super wysiwyg what you see is what you get we don't talk about wysiwyg that much anymore
[01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:24.560]  Uh because so much stuff we either just assume it is or isn't but it's squarespace
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:30.640]  You just what you see is what you get you just look at it. You drag stuff around you drag stuff out
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:37.600]  Move it from the left to the right you do it all right there in the website. It's a fantastic service it is
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:41.040]  I i've said this many times. I know they sponsor the show all the time
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:46.160]  I have to think of things to say I one of my favorite things to think about with squarespace is I know
[01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:53.520]  That the people who listen to this podcast tend to be technically minded. You're sort of the the nerd friend or family member
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:56.480]  People come to you. Maybe if they need a website
[01:32:57.040 --> 01:33:02.160]  You can help them out. You know how to make a website send them to squarespace and then they can just do it themselves
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:07.520]  It's not on your shoulders if they do need technical support squarespace has award-winning technical support
[01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:12.000]  They probably won't need it though. It's all right there so easy to understand
[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:16.160]  It's absolutely just the best way
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:22.800]  To create and host your own website. No skill level or coding experience required
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:27.440]  But if you do have coding experience you can get in there and customize it as deeply as you want to

[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:02.160]  All right, where do we where do we talk about in the remainder of the show?
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:04.880]  Well, I think the the design aspect where
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:07.280]  so first off
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:14.080]  designs being split like there is a ux guy and there is a a hardware guy and they are both reporting up to
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:17.280]  up to jeff williams who and and
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.640]  It's important to note at the same time. There was also a new head of operations named. Yeah, I think
[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:25.280]  I missed that yesterday
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:30.240]  Yeah, it's super important to consider because as long so I think it's wrong to consider
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:34.820]  As long so I think it's wrong to say that design is now under operations
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:38.960]  What is right to say is that jeff williams is the ceo and waiting?
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:44.640]  And I think that's actually a better way to to frame what happened
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:48.960]  As opposed to to like he's not the he's not the operations guy anymore
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:55.760]  He is the coo and just as tim cook was the coo and and jeff williams replaced tim cook to be the head of operations
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:35:00.640]  like now operations is one of many things that jeff williams manages as opposed to
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:03.680]  The thing that he manages. Yeah, and he's been
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:06.800]  In charge of apple watch from the beginning
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:12.480]  Like like in charge in charge like like he was like johnny. I've reported to him even though johnny
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:15.120]  I've like he wasn't he wasn't completely power enough
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:18.000]  From what i've heard, uh williams was not a huge edition fan
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:26.000]  He wasn't maybe in the place to to shoot it down, but he like owned the entire project not just the operations part of it
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.320]  yeah, absolutely, and you know now these guys report to him and I do think
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:33.120]  that the um
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:39.600]  What is this? Is he on the svp page now this the new uh senior vice? Yeah, uh sobin khan, I believe yeah
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.340]  sabi khan
[01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:43.340]  s a b i h khan
[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:50.860]  Is now the senior vice president of operations senior vice president is the level where you get a picture on the executive
[01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:52.780]  profile page
[01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:54.780]  yep
[01:35:56.140 --> 01:35:57.500]  And
[01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:03.340]  You don't name a guy senior vice president of operations while there still is a coo
[01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:05.180]  without
[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:06.780]  uh
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:12.700]  It coo is just sort of it's like exactly what you said. It's like what tim cook was under steve jobs
[01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:13.900]  it's
[01:36:13.900 --> 01:36:18.060]  sure operations, I guess is technically still reporting to him, but it's it's
[01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:24.460]  Right. It's called chief operations officer. But what it actually means in the case of apple is second in command in the company
[01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:31.420]  Yeah, and like of the entire company like so the like all of apple now reports to jeff williams not just the operations side
[01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:33.740]  Right. And so if we want to
[01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:34.920]  start
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:36.380]  speculating
[01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:43.980]  There's there's a part of me like I I I didn't pick up on on that when I wrote yesterday. Uh, and I was
[01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:49.260]  So if anything I don't regret it, but it you know, it was a hot take, you know
[01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:53.580]  I I wrote I wrote my piece within an hour of finding out you know the news
[01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:55.420]  um
[01:36:55.420 --> 01:37:03.260]  And my my take was highly critical of having the hardware and software design people report to jeff williams
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:05.900]  um
[01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:07.260]  and
[01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:11.900]  i'm not gonna say I regret it, but I think the alternate take is exactly what you said, which is that it's
[01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:19.260]  Not so much about putting those things under operations, but establishing jeff williams as the ceo and waiting
[01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:23.580]  uh, which in turn is interesting because
[01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:32.300]  I don't know that jeff williams is even younger than tim cook. They're both I think roughly the same age. Uh,
[01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:34.780]  but I
[01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:37.680]  If we you know for all the the speculation
[01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:42.780]  We in the commentariat have done over the last few years about hey is johnny. I've on the way out
[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:45.500]  I think now the question is is tim cook on the way out
[01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:48.060]  Yep
[01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:49.260]  You know
[01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:55.340]  On a time frame is two years older than uh, jeff williams by the way. Tim book is 58. Jeff williams is 56, right?
[01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:57.020]  uh
[01:37:57.020 --> 01:37:59.020]  You know and is it just you know?
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:01.580]  so not even a question of
[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:03.100]  age
[01:38:03.100 --> 01:38:05.100]  but maybe you know of
[01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:06.780]  uh
[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:10.940]  Just being tired of it. I don't know, you know that, you know moving on and maybe having a next
[01:38:11.260 --> 01:38:15.580]  Doing something else with the remainder of his life. Who knows but it's certainly
[01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:18.220]  uh
[01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:23.980]  There's no other way to look at it, even if tim cook is going to be ceo for the next 20 years, uh
[01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:30.460]  There's no other way to look at yesterday's announcement. I mean, it's certainly obviously mostly about johnny eiv
[01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:33.260]  But it's clearly a promotion of jeff williams
[01:38:34.780 --> 01:38:42.540]  Yep, I I think that's exactly right and you know the I could it's easier than ever before I think to see
[01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:46.780]  tim cook doing something else I think I mean, I think the uh
[01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:50.540]  His passion around this privacy issue
[01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:57.440]  I could definitely see him sort of becoming chairman of the board or something and becoming like a full-time advocate
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:00.320]  or for privacy in technology companies, you know
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:04.000]  Being against what google and facebook and that sort of thing
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:12.000]  He's constrained and limited in what he can do as apple ceo and despite the fact he's pushes the line as
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:17.200]  As far as he absolutely can and again, this is not a judgment call on either side saying it's good or bad
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:22.960]  But it's clearly going on and something that clearly drives him and animates him and I could see you know
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:29.520]  Again, this is pure speculation knowing nothing, but you're right. Jeff williams is quite clearly without question
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:34.080]  Number two in the company and nothing says that like putting design to your point
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:40.800]  Putting design under him because if apple is to remain apple and design is to remain what it what it must for apple
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:46.720]  Then the only way that this like to your point your hot take would be correctly would be totally on point
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:52.560]  If this is the only explanation in which which there's a a a good reason, you know
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:57.760]  To your objection is if it's basically he's the ceo and in everything but name
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:00.480]  You know, I people
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:05.760]  Critics of tim cook, uh people who think and and some of them sincerely
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:09.120]  I mean, it's a reasonable debate to be had. I mean tim cook is not steve jobs
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:12.480]  I think to his credit as I wrote yesterday
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:18.560]  He's never tried to be and and he has never tried to be a product person. You know, he's he's
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:22.640]  He is who he is. He's seemingly extremely comfortable
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:28.240]  with what he's who he is and what he's good at and hasn't tried to
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:32.960]  Take over product design and and I really think as a direct comparison
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:39.120]  I really think that was the downfall of apple in the scully era is that john scully also was a
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:46.800]  also was a ceo who was not a product person, you know famously came from the soda industry, uh,
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:53.040]  and you know after pushing steve jobs out of the country out of the company not the country but uh,
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:57.600]  Seemingly, I think convinced himself that he was that he was a product person
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:02.880]  And the newton was a fascinating product. It was definitely scully's baby
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:07.920]  And I think it's I think it gets a bad rap in history
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:14.720]  Uh, but it it he they obviously shipped it way too soon. It was right. He didn't he didn't know how to edit, right?
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:21.840]  It's one thing to have a product idea. That's another thing to actually understand what it means to ship a product out the door, right?
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:26.160]  And and and and how it's a fascinating example of how
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:33.760]  The first impression can really sync a product whereas you know, if the newton had shipped two years later and had been a little smaller
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:39.060]  Had a handwriting recognition that worked as it did within two or three years. They had excellent handwriting recognition
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:47.600]  It it wouldn't have had the the stink of failure around it that it all it never shook from when it originally debuted in
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:49.360]  dunesbury, you know
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:51.920]  Dunes everything from dunesbury to the simpsons
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:54.800]  mocked it mercilessly
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:59.840]  For for its inability to recognize handwriting which was the whole point of the device the
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:03.440]  The whole point of the device was that it would recognize your handwriting
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:07.680]  Yeah, and it didn't it couldn't do the one thing it could it was supposed to do
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:10.560]  It would be like if the iphone shipped and couldn't make a phone call
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:12.880]  you know like
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:19.840]  It just it just couldn't it it just wasn't ready to ship tim cook's never been that you know, I think that's to his credit
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:27.440]  But I do I and and my optimistic take on this and I wrote this yesterday that that
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:32.000]  Johnny, iv's departure. I don't think you know, i'm a huge fan. I think he's a genius. I
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:37.840]  Just you know, we could go on and on for hours and hours about more of his product designs
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:42.000]  Right, I could do a podcast where we just page through that book the the big
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:49.840]  60-pound coffee table book and spend minutes on each page talking about these wonderful products and how how nicely designed they are and all
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:51.840]  these details
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:54.960]  But I do think that without steve
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:58.900]  But I do think that without steve jobs as his collaborator
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:04.820]  That something significant was lost. Like you said like he's not a good self-editor
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:11.840]  Uh, you can't help but think to name just two products. You can't help but think that this
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:17.680]  Uh macbook keyboard fiasco which we're in the midst of and has been ongoing for years
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:19.580]  is
[01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:21.580]  attributable to
[01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:28.940]  Johnny, iv's obsession with device thinness that they made the the keyboard with so little travel and with these
[01:43:29.260 --> 01:43:31.260]  Keys that aren't durable
[01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:33.740]  because they needed to
[01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:38.460]  Do something radical with the keyboard to make the whole device as thin as he wanted the device to be
[01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:43.900]  Yep, remember it was jobs that said design is how it works. It wasn't johnny iv that said that right and you know
[01:43:45.260 --> 01:43:47.660]  You know, there's there's I I don't know if it's
[01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:51.920]  it's apocryphal or not, but it's often attributable to albert einstein that
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:59.680]  Everything should be as simple as possible, but not more. So something along those lines. I think it's because it's an
[01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:07.360]  Apocryphal quote there's no one definition, but it's a great sentiment. Everything should be as simple as possible, but not more
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:12.160]  So, you know that there's a point where you can make things too simple, right?
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:17.200]  Yeah, everything should be as thin as possible, but no more. Yeah, exactly as thin as possible
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:23.680]  But no more and I think it's that the the current entire generation of macbooks is a bit too thin
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:29.040]  And therefore has keyboards that are that are that are aren't aren't thick enough
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:31.920]  And I think the other product
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:35.120]  That comes to mind is the trash can mac pro
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:40.720]  Uh, which isn't as important right? The macbook is super important to apple
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:45.600]  It's the you know, it's really the only max that really matter right like apple could
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:50.800]  Still be a fantastically successful pc maker making nothing but macbooks
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:56.960]  Like the imax and the mac the new mac pro that they're all rounding errors and it's great
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:00.320]  It would be a whole separate podcast. It's important that they make them
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:04.320]  i'm glad they make them and for a certain segment of the market, it really is important but
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:08.400]  At a financial level almost every mac sold is a macbook
[01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:10.400]  and to have a
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:14.800]  A flaky keyboard and to have it be you know
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:19.920]  Have this reputation and and all these stories being written about it is is not good for the company
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:25.120]  The mac pro isn't as important but I think that the trash can mac pro is almost more telling because to me
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:28.800]  The new mac pro the one they just announced three weeks ago
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:34.720]  Is a mac pro designed for true high-end workstation users
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:39.280]  The 2013 trash can mac pro seems to me and in hindsight
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:45.520]  This sounds glib, but it seems like johnny ive's idea of a mac pro. That's exactly it. It's it's it's a
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:50.000]  Shockingly poorly designed device if you actually think about what the point of it is
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:55.600]  Like you it was limited to one use case, which is like high-end video production, right?
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:58.880]  And it wasn't actually even good at that because of the thermal the thermal issues
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:03.680]  Like it's it's in retrospect. It's kind of amazing that apple shipped this product
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:10.640]  Because it's it's it's it's but it's beautiful and it was small and it fit on the desk and all those sorts of things
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:11.120]  And yeah
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:17.920]  It's like I put I put a line in my day-to-day the idea like like revolutions always go too far and sort of veer towards tyranny
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:24.000]  And like if you again to take the whole picture to start with those those iMacs and to make something
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:28.500]  Desirable that was previously never desirable with such a tremendous breakthrough
[01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:36.020]  But it went too far and you ended up with this back pro that was gorgeous and beautiful and desirable and a terrible
[01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:41.140]  Computer and a terrible computer for it or a particularly terrible computer for the market
[01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:47.540]  It was intended for no exactly it was back with growth is exact same sort of thing. Yes thinners good. Yes, beautiful good
[01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:52.660]  Yes, that form factor, you know, you had that titanium, you know power book, but it was it was huge
[01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:57.300]  It was it was big it was heavy and again to bring it down and to bring it down and and you know
[01:46:57.300 --> 01:47:02.740]  And and you know to culminate like those 20 was it 2015 2013, you know that were that were perfect
[01:47:02.900 --> 01:47:08.120]  But then you had to go too far in and the port the the getting rid of the ports and the keyboard situation
[01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:10.420]  it's like that's what happens you go too far and
[01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:14.340]  particularly if you're by yourself and I think I think the point you're driving at is
[01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:18.100]  You asked what would happen if jobs was still there?
[01:47:18.740 --> 01:47:25.220]  Well, you would have someone pulling back right? You have someone saying no, we can't shift the hat like, uh, you know, like
[01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:30.660]  It actually design is how it works and that how it works aspect of design
[01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:34.980]  It was if if i've had a weak spot it was undervaluing that
[01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:42.020]  Same thing with the iowa 7 like iowa 7 was so much more beautiful than iowa 6 and it was much harder to use
[01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:45.460]  Like you didn't know you didn't know which button to push. You don't know. What was a button
[01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:50.100]  What was a label you couldn't tell if it was capital letters or not capital letters like at the end of the day
[01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:52.020]  that is a
[01:47:52.020 --> 01:47:56.900]  Design is is how it works and that is also holt looks
[01:47:57.140 --> 01:48:01.380]  yeah, and and remember how thin and wispy the the the fonts were I mean
[01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:07.700]  Helvetica helvetica noia at the time not because it predated the existence of san francisco
[01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:10.180]  But the the fonts that were so thin
[01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:13.540]  And if you took a screenshot, it was beautiful
[01:48:14.420 --> 01:48:20.100]  It really did look good and and those thin fonts, you know, there's a you know, there's all sorts of
[01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:22.500]  Areas of print where I think spawn is
[01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:26.740]  Perfect and what you need but as a user interface font it was
[01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:30.340]  It was not good. It was it was not a usable
[01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:33.300]  You know
[01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:34.340]  It went too far
[01:48:34.340 --> 01:48:40.020]  it's no better way to put it than what you just said a minute or two ago that a revolution every revolution goes too far and
[01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:45.220]  Ios interface needed a revolution, you know, it was great
[01:48:45.220 --> 01:48:51.860]  But it it went too far and it it's seemingly in the year since still was all very
[01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:57.860]  Johnny, I've and I kind of feel like with him out. There's a good chance that we might
[01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:02.900]  It might move in a good direction. Yeah. Well, the the thing about the mac pro
[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:07.940]  I think the most interesting thing from a sort of organizational perspective is this mac pro
[01:49:08.260 --> 01:49:11.780]  Professional users group or whatever the thing that they set up. I mean you would know where about it
[01:49:11.780 --> 01:49:17.880]  because you went to that briefing but this idea that apple is overtly saying we're going to go out and listen to customers
[01:49:18.180 --> 01:49:23.380]  Instead of build a jewel and drop it from heaven. Yeah, like that that is a that's a
[01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:30.920]  Uh, it's backlash is the term for it's a rebound. I don't know. I can't think of the right word, but it's a it's an appropriate
[01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:35.940]  Retreat from sort of uh from that revolution like at some point you do
[01:49:36.340 --> 01:49:41.140]  Need to understand customers you do need to listen to them and do you want to go all the way in the opposite direction?
[01:49:41.140 --> 01:49:46.740]  Where you're you know, microsoft and you're you can't actually move things forward because you're so bound to
[01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:51.700]  Backwards compatibility and giving customers what they want and those sorts of things. No, you can go too much in the other direction
[01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:55.700]  But you know you where can you find that sort of happy middle where you're actually?
[01:49:56.500 --> 01:50:02.180]  Understanding and giving customers what they need where the design is what works best not just what looks best
[01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:07.540]  and and yeah, I think if there's a reason to be optimistic here because uh, you know
[01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:13.700]  That's a organizational adjustment. You're not going to get that internal individual sort of adjustment and that's fine. Like
[01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:16.420]  Johnny, i've was amazing. He was incredible
[01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:22.500]  He he did what he said on this earth to do and and I wish him the best and everything that he does
[01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:28.500]  And I think there's a there's there's a reason to be optimistic about apple by the fact that he's leaving and that's is
[01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:33.300]  Not a criticism of at all. It's just like the way things work. Yeah, and I you know time the time had come
[01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:38.900]  I also think it could be and and you know again the proof will be in the pudding and you just need good people in charge
[01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:45.540]  But I think that it could be a very good thing for apple in general to have software and hardware design
[01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:52.340]  Separated again as different people and I really think because I think fundamentally and I know we're running short on time
[01:50:52.340 --> 01:50:59.140]  But fundamentally johnny i've is a hardware guy. He is a hardware person and I feel like under his direction
[01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:07.140]  The software that the problems that a lot of us have with the software design from the ios 7 era forward. We're all about
[01:51:08.580 --> 01:51:15.780]  Subserviating the software to the hardware and having someone who's purely the software advocate
[01:51:17.380 --> 01:51:18.420]  And
[01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:24.420]  And and and completely isolated from the hardware in terms of day-to-day responsibilities could really help
[01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:30.200]  Bolster the overall design quality and you just plain old-fashioned usability
[01:51:30.900 --> 01:51:32.900]  Of the software. Yep
[01:51:33.140 --> 01:51:35.140]  I completely agree
[01:51:35.460 --> 01:51:37.460]  Anyway, any other points you want to make I know?
[01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:43.460]  This is great. I we don't do emergency podcasts bill. Bill simmons loves to call him an emergency pod, you know
[01:51:43.460 --> 01:51:49.220]  And I don't know how he does it because bill simmons whose show you've been on and have were fantastic on
[01:51:49.460 --> 01:51:51.980]  But like when there's like a major like NBA
[01:51:51.980 --> 01:51:57.180]  Trade or something like that. He put he gets a podcast out like 70 minutes later. I don't know how that's possible
[01:51:57.180 --> 01:52:01.420]  I don't know if he just lives in the podcast. No, he has a studio built in like a yeah
[01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:03.660]  I think he has like a guest house and he has like a studio built there
[01:52:03.660 --> 01:52:07.180]  So he literally like goes up to the backyard and records. I don't know how he does it so quick
[01:52:07.180 --> 01:52:13.020]  But on the other hand, I you know, I guess he's just he's just the the most natural born podcaster on the planet
[01:52:13.020 --> 01:52:18.300]  Oh, yeah, it's incredible. He's he's a great writer and I bet it doesn't actually matter what he says
[01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:25.900]  Like like there will be things you disagree with but the the these the way he manages and runs a podcast and interviews people
[01:52:25.900 --> 01:52:31.340]  Is it's incredible. It's he's the best there is. I can agree, you know, and maybe other people can look at me and say well
[01:52:31.340 --> 01:52:38.140]  How how does John Gruber get his column out on Johnny Ives departure 60 minutes after the news dropped?
[01:52:38.220 --> 01:52:43.020]  Maybe you know because that's the thing. I'm good at I could have never done this podcast last night
[01:52:43.020 --> 01:52:45.740]  I just couldn't have I I needed to be a part of it
[01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:51.340]  I needed hours and hours overnight to to digest it more to be able to talk about it
[01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:55.980]  But so for me one day later, this is an emergency podcast
[01:52:56.860 --> 01:52:58.860]  And I know you're on vacation
[01:52:59.260 --> 01:53:04.620]  And I just really knew that I wanted to do it with you and I'm so glad that we were able to make this happen Ben
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:09.180]  yeah, well, I'm just I I find the thing that again just the
[01:53:11.100 --> 01:53:13.660]  We talked about it with the end of the next episode
[01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:19.180]  we talked about it with the end of the next era like with like the end of the Johnny Ive era and and to me there's
[01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:25.340]  I you know, it's always tempting to look backwards and overfit things and see how all things fit together
[01:53:25.660 --> 01:53:26.300]  but again
[01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:31.500]  Just tying it in with the end of the itunes era the end of sort of the iphone being the the everything and everything
[01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:32.700]  apple
[01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:35.260]  Sort of branching out and you know, we talked about you know
[01:53:35.260 --> 01:53:40.860]  The ipod going from conception to launching in eight months and you know apple sells, you know
[01:53:40.860 --> 01:53:46.460]  As many iphones in like five hours that they sold total ipods in like the first quarter that was for sale
[01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:54.380]  And in it's a different company like this idea of having this this titular figure at the top that that drives everything
[01:53:54.780 --> 01:53:59.420]  It just it really starts to fall apart when you're shipping hundreds of millions of phones a year
[01:53:59.500 --> 01:53:59.740]  Yeah
[01:53:59.740 --> 01:54:02.940]  And you're doing all these services and i've pushed a long time for apple
[01:54:03.180 --> 01:54:08.220]  To change like their organizational structure and which I think they have like that guy in charge of serie who came from google
[01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:11.020]  He now reports to tim cook. It's a separate division
[01:54:11.020 --> 01:54:15.580]  He's not under craig federighi like it was previously which is exactly what they need to do there
[01:54:16.060 --> 01:54:18.620]  It's such a bigger company doing so many more things
[01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:21.980]  You can't be the same forever and and you know
[01:54:22.060 --> 01:54:24.620]  I think apple for a few years was kind of like san francisco
[01:54:24.780 --> 01:54:26.140]  Like people are trying to say, you know
[01:54:26.140 --> 01:54:30.300]  We need to hold on to the character of san francisco and what actually ends up happening is you build no new houses
[01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:36.060]  And you lose all the people that create that character. You just get a bunch of rich people like I think apple fell in that trap
[01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:42.060]  And from an organizational structure standpoint wanting to say we're going to be the way steve jobs designers be very functional
[01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:46.300]  We're going to be very focused and actually it was bad for the company
[01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:52.540]  It produced it produced it ossified the company and I feel like over the last particularly the last six months
[01:54:52.700 --> 01:54:56.460]  I I mentioned this on on search equity. I think that earnings warning
[01:54:57.100 --> 01:55:01.260]  Was the best thing that could have happened to apple because it kind of shook them loose from this sort of coma
[01:55:01.260 --> 01:55:03.740]  They were almost in and I think this fits in it, you know
[01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:09.500]  Johnny, iv deserves all the credit in the world and I actually think it's probably good news for apple that is moving on like apple
[01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:11.740]  This is a new apple for better or worse
[01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:14.460]  And they don't have a choice, right?
[01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:20.540]  It's good to see them embracing the fact that they need to be something new because they can never go back to being what they were
[01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:26.880]  Uh, that's a great way to put it ben thompson. Thank you. Everybody can read your work every day at strateckery

[01:55:30.060 --> 01:55:32.060]  Uh, how is it pronounced?
[01:55:32.060 --> 01:55:34.060]  Strateckery, uh

[01:55:40.140 --> 01:55:41.900]  no tech ben
[01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:46.140]  Yeah, which I shouldn't promote because I swear I I I I lose I lose customers
[01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:52.940]  Hey, we didn't we just did this whole emergency podcast and never once mentioned, uh basketball or baseball even though i'm going
[01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:58.300]  I'm going to two baseball games this weekend. So, uh, yeah, uh, I I thought about bringing it up, but we were limited on time
[01:55:58.300 --> 01:56:01.420]  so we we can't mention it, but I think you know, we're looking at a
[01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:08.620]  Fairly high likelihood that my favorite team the yankees and yours the brewers might be might be colliding in the world series
[01:56:08.620 --> 01:56:12.620]  They're they're both, you know, uh brewers have had a rough stretch though. We'll see. We'll see
[01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:15.180]  We have major pitching issues
[01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:27.980]  We'll see anyway ben. Thank you very much. Uh, I will talk to you soon. All right, sounds good. Bye. Bye
