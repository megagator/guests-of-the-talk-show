[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Uh, are you wearing shoes?
[00:02.000 --> 00:04.600]  Uh, yeah, I am. Are we, uh, are we going out?
[00:04.600 --> 00:06.100]  Is this, are we having an outside day?
[00:06.100 --> 00:07.400]  I, I am not wearing shoes.
[00:07.400 --> 00:07.900]  Oh, I see.
[00:07.900 --> 00:09.900]  I've done it with socks on.
[00:09.900 --> 00:12.600]  In the wintertime, I often do it with my slippers.
[00:12.600 --> 00:18.600]  And I, it's so ungodly hot here that I...
[00:18.600 --> 00:23.600]  And we have air conditioning, but it's, it's like the air conditioning is struggling to...
[00:23.600 --> 00:24.100]  Keep up.
[00:24.100 --> 00:26.000]  It's losing the battle.
[00:26.000 --> 00:33.000]  We were down in Florida for some, uh, uh, you know, to see some of the theme parks for Family Vacation.
[00:33.000 --> 00:39.000]  And the weather is, I mean, is of course stifling hot and humid down in Orlando, Florida.
[00:39.000 --> 00:43.000]  And it is exactly the same here in Philadelphia.
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.000]  Well, we always plan our, uh, our trip back east, um, to coincide with the worst possible weather.
[00:48.000 --> 00:48.500]  So, uh...
[00:48.500 --> 00:49.200]  Early August?
[00:49.200 --> 00:51.500]  We'll be, we'll be going to, we'll be going to Baltimore in August.
[00:51.500 --> 00:58.000]  Oh, beautiful! Baltimore is absolutely beautiful in August.
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.000]  At the time, it couldn't be better.
[01:00.000 --> 01:04.000]  It's just like you, to give your sweat glands a good, uh, you know...
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.000]  Yeah, right. It's like, it's a cleanse.
[01:06.000 --> 01:11.500]  You know, it's like, like when they, when they, your car gets serviced, they put it up on the thing where the wheels spin.
[01:11.500 --> 01:15.000]  And then they, you know, put the, you gotta, you gotta put the gas all the way down.
[01:15.000 --> 01:19.500]  That's, that's like, you know, you just gotta, you know, do that with your sweat glands.
[01:19.500 --> 01:21.000]  Yeah. Flush out all the toxins.
[01:21.000 --> 01:22.500]  Barefoot. I'm absolutely barefoot.
[01:22.500 --> 01:25.000]  And I got, and I got a lot of toxins, so...
[01:25.000 --> 01:28.500]  We can roll right into this. One of the things I wanted to talk to you about, I really do,
[01:28.500 --> 01:31.500]  I'd like a little parenting, a little parenting episode here of the talk show.
[01:31.500 --> 01:40.000]  Um, because, uh, I was catching up on, uh, podcasts and the ATP guys were talking about, uh, quote-unquote, screen time.
[01:40.000 --> 01:40.500]  Mm-hmm.
[01:40.500 --> 01:43.000]  And made the, the excellent point.
[01:43.000 --> 01:46.000]  We don't, we don't really talk about screen time here in our family either.
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  That it's, um, uh, Syracuse has had a big, long rant about it.
[01:51.000 --> 01:53.500]  But basically, it's no, it's no fair to just say screen time.
[01:53.500 --> 01:59.500]  Because, you know, if a kid's reading a book on an iPad, why does that count as screen time?
[01:59.500 --> 02:02.000]  I mean, it's like, there's things that you might want to limit.
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.500]  Like watching TV and YouTube and movies and playing video games.
[02:07.500 --> 02:08.500]  Right.
[02:08.500 --> 02:12.500]  I don't, is Hank aware that there are such things as video games?
[02:12.500 --> 02:15.500]  You might have played one, or you might have played one or two.
[02:15.500 --> 02:17.000]  Maybe Jonas has discovered them.
[02:17.000 --> 02:19.500]  He's seen me play them. I know that much.
[02:19.500 --> 02:27.500]  Uh, I don't. It is interesting though. Amy and I, I, uh, you know, we don't really have like a hard and fast rule about it.
[02:27.500 --> 02:32.500]  And I think, if anything, we are probably a little too lax, uh, about it.
[02:32.500 --> 02:35.500]  Yeah, yeah. We're probably, we're probably much the same.
[02:35.500 --> 02:49.500]  Uh, Jonas is of the personality that, you know, he's very sociable. He is. But he would happily spend his entire summer doing nothing but playing video games in our house.
[02:49.500 --> 02:56.500]  Right. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I mean, Hank would do the, you know, would do the same.
[02:56.500 --> 03:02.500]  And usually, I mean, our thing is just not so much screen time as it is, like, non-screen time.
[03:02.500 --> 03:03.500]  And there's a minimum.
[03:03.500 --> 03:07.500]  Right. Like, you've got to figure out something to do that doesn't involve looking at a screen.
[03:07.500 --> 03:13.500]  Right. Right. Um, and so, you know, he does, you know, he plays chess. We play chess with him. He likes to cook.
[03:13.500 --> 03:16.500]  We often have him in the kitchen to, like, make dinner and lunch and stuff like that.
[03:16.500 --> 03:26.500]  And so, we do things like that. Um, but I mean, yeah, but like you said, like, a lot of the stuff that he plays on, on his iPad or his iPhone is, like, he'll play chess.
[03:26.500 --> 03:32.500]  Or he's playing, um, words with friends, with family members. And that stuff doesn't seem bad.
[03:32.500 --> 03:33.500]  Right.
[03:33.500 --> 03:42.500]  I mean, it's certainly no, you know, it's certainly way better than, um, playing, you know, I can't even think of, I mean, he plays, he still likes to play Flappy Bird.
[03:42.500 --> 03:49.500]  And Andy, and, you know, he's much better at it than I am. So, you know, he's developed, he's developed serious Flappy Bird skills.
[03:49.500 --> 03:53.500]  So that's good. That'll, I'm sure that'll work out well for him later in life.
[03:53.500 --> 04:05.500]  One of the things that Amy and I struggle with, and it is, it is different from when you and I were kids, because I would have had, well, I like playing sports and Jonas doesn't.
[04:05.500 --> 04:16.500]  So, I would go out to play actual sports. Um, and we had a community pool in, in the small town where I grew up that was where everybody hung out.
[04:16.500 --> 04:24.500]  And so we'd all, you know, in the summer, we'd every, I would go to the pool every day, just go to the pool. Uh, Jonas doesn't really have anything like that here.
[04:24.500 --> 04:38.500]  But the other thing that is different is that sometimes, not all the time, not even most of the time, but sometimes the games are actually sociable where his friends will, you know, text each other and say, let's all play whatever.
[04:38.500 --> 04:47.500]  And they, everybody, you know, it's, it seems like a very happy coincidence. I mean, maybe there's one poor kid in his gang who's got an Xbox instead of a PlayStation.
[04:47.500 --> 04:58.500]  And I just don't know about it. And he's like excluded, but they all have PlayStation fours, which I really don't remember when we got it, that it was coordinated with his friends.
[04:58.500 --> 05:02.500]  It seems like a happy coincidence. But anyway, they're all on these headsets and they're yelling at each other.
[05:02.500 --> 05:12.500]  And it's a lot like, you know, like having them over to the house, you know, the kids are in the house, except the other people's stinky kids aren't in my house. So it's actually kind of great.
[05:12.500 --> 05:29.500]  But Amy and I don't really know, you know, does that, is that, you know, a little, you know, it seems, it seems almost wrong to, to, you know, not to limit it, but to say, Hey, enough, because it seems like that's what him and his friends want to do to play with each other.
[05:29.500 --> 05:46.500]  Yeah. Which is kind of what we would have done, like going out someplace and doing something. And I imagine, I mean, I would feel, I would think that where you live, I mean, maybe he's getting old enough now, but it's not exactly the kind of environment that you would just like let a kid out the door.
[05:46.500 --> 06:02.500]  No, we, well, Amy and I differ on that a little bit. I'm a little bit more willing to start letting him go out and about. And Amy is still of the, he's 12. So just for, just for the client, not that everybody knows how old my kid is, but he's 12 heading into seventh grade.
[06:02.500 --> 06:26.500]  Amy is still very over, not overprotective, very protective. And perhaps the reason, you know, to the point where I don't, I don't, you know, I, I almost defer to her wisdom that, you know, but I still think though that I think the world at large is very different. You and I grew up as like the last of the wild feral kids.
[06:26.500 --> 06:55.500]  Yeah. I mean, I, but I just, I lived in a different environment too. I mean, it was a much more, it was a much smaller town and lots of, we had woods in the backyard and, you know, trails leading in all directions. And so we, yeah, I mean, we were just, you know, I mean, I could go out the door anytime and just play in the woods or something. Playing in the woods was the thing that we did. We don't have that. I mean, you know, if he goes out to play in the woods here, that's inhabited by homeless people.
[06:55.500 --> 07:13.500]  So it's not, it's not the same. But it is important for him to do. And we're kind of, you know, we're getting the, I mean, and we've done, you know, like he's got a friend who lives like three blocks away and, you know, we will let him walk over there anytime he wants to.
[07:13.500 --> 07:36.500]  So he's, you know, he gets, he gets, he gets, definitely gets to do some of that. And, you know, the other, like, when was it? Was it 4th of July? Anyway, it was a few weeks ago and we had some friends over and like he had a buddy with, you know, with this other couple and they, we were having dessert, I think, and we didn't, we were out of like whipped cream and he loves to have like whipped cream on his ice cream.
[07:36.500 --> 07:45.500]  So there was a, well, you know, and, you know, instead of complaining about it, why don't you walk over to the convenience store and get, you know, which is like four blocks from here. Why don't you walk to the convenience store and go get some?
[07:45.500 --> 07:59.500]  And so the two of them just, you know, we gave them like five bucks and they walked out the door and, and then, you know, they walked over and bought it and came back and, and that's the, I mean, that stuff is fine. Particularly now, I mean, you know, when there's, particularly when there's two of them, I feel much better about it.
[07:59.500 --> 08:17.500]  It seems ridiculous, right? That that's like a moment, but I know exactly what you mean. Like we're exactly at the exact same stage where it's like, well, I swear to God, it was like a couple of months ago, we gave Jonas a letter to drop in the mailbox and it was like, and he was like, are you sure?
[08:17.500 --> 08:35.500]  And we're like, we're sure it'll be all right. Take your phone. I can remember when Hank was really young. I mean, he was three maybe. And I can't remember if it was a letter, I think it was like a card or something that we had to break a birthday card for one of the grandparents or something like that.
[08:35.500 --> 08:51.500]  And he had sat down with Karen to sign it and like put it in the envelope, put a stamp on it and address it. And so they did that. And then Karen kind of like turned her back and, and, and she was like, and then like a minute or two later, we're like, where's Hank?
[08:51.500 --> 09:03.500]  Where the heck is Hank? And we noticed the front door is open and he had just like grabbed the thing. He knew where the mailbox is like three blocks away and he was booking to the mailbox.
[09:03.500 --> 09:07.500]  He was going to mail that letter. So it was like an assertion of independence.
[09:07.500 --> 09:14.500]  Well, you know, it was just, I don't even think it was, well, sort of, but I mean, I think it was mostly just like, he knew that was the next thing that needed to be done and he was going to do it.
[09:14.500 --> 09:26.500]  He was just going to take care of it. And, and this little, you know, a little three-year-old is running up, running up the street and, and this is long before he knew enough about crossing the street and, and people can bomb through this neighborhood sometimes.
[09:26.500 --> 09:40.500]  So, you know, naturally being the, the, the modern day parents that we are, we freaked out and chased after him, like tackled him like half a block away and brought him back.
[09:40.500 --> 09:47.500]  Those were idiots. Instead of like running up and saying, okay, let's go. Oh my God, where are you going? What's going on?
[09:47.500 --> 09:57.500]  And at first we didn't realize what he was doing. All we knew was that he was just like off and running. And then later I think we were like, Oh, he was going to the mailbox.
[09:57.500 --> 09:59.500]  And he had the letter.
[09:59.500 --> 10:11.500]  Yeah. Yeah. Which we should have figured out, but I think the panic of like, not seeing, you know, there's that moment where you like, you turn around and the kid's gone and you're like, Oh my God, I'm that parent.
[10:11.500 --> 10:15.500]  I'm that parent that was in the news.
[10:15.500 --> 10:30.500]  Yeah. For us, a big part of it is definitely, at least in my mind is honestly just the safety of crossing the street because it's, you know, cars go fast, fast enough that, you know, they would kill you.
[10:30.500 --> 10:37.500]  Yeah. Yeah. Well, here we have all these, you know, we have a mess of intersections with no stop signs.
[10:37.500 --> 10:43.500]  That's a four way, you know, it's like a four way, no stop and nobody knows how to deal with them.
[10:43.500 --> 10:50.500]  Technically you're supposed to let the person, like if you arrive at the same time, the person to the right has the right away.
[10:50.500 --> 10:51.500]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[10:51.500 --> 11:00.500]  Yeah. But very few people know that. And usually the way, what people think is the person who's going the fastest gets to go.
[11:00.500 --> 11:03.500]  I'm going faster than you. I should get to go.
[11:03.500 --> 11:20.500]  I grew up in the small town where Amy and I grew up was lots and lots of, almost everything was a four way stop. And what I remember, you know, in the handful of years where I was of driving age and living there was that the procedure was,
[11:20.500 --> 11:33.500]  it's like what, you know, living in suburbia full of very nice people is both drivers like wave to each other. Both of them wave saying, you go, you know, you go, you go.
[11:33.500 --> 11:40.500]  And then eventually one of you gives up after 30 seconds and goes.
[11:40.500 --> 11:46.500]  Usually what happens is you both give up at the same time and then you both start going and then the whole process starts all over again.
[11:46.500 --> 11:55.500]  Right. I like this idea and I bet you're right. That makes total sense. If I ever learned that to pass the driver's test written exam, I've since forgotten it.
[11:55.500 --> 12:04.500]  I had forgotten it for the longest time. And in our first house here, it didn't really matter because we were on a busy street and there were stop signs all the way along it.
[12:04.500 --> 12:11.500]  But then we moved to this house like 12 years ago. Yeah. And since then I've had to learn.
[12:11.500 --> 12:19.500]  How about this smart guy? What if, what if it's two cars facing each other and they both want to make lefts and they arrive at the same time?
[12:19.500 --> 12:24.500]  They both want to make lefts so they can go.
[12:24.500 --> 12:31.500]  Right? No. Yes, they can. If they're both facing, if they're across the way, they both want to make lefts so you can, they can both go.
[12:31.500 --> 12:36.500]  You mean, you mean they both want to go the same way? One wants to make left, the other one wants to make a right? Or both going to the same road?
[12:36.500 --> 12:38.500]  Yeah, something like that.
[12:38.500 --> 12:43.500]  Yeah, yeah, that I, that I think it's the person who wants to make a right who gets to go.
[12:43.500 --> 12:49.500]  Oh, because the other person is turning across traffic and must yield.
[12:49.500 --> 12:54.500]  I see what you mean. Yeah, yeah. Boy, I bet you're a good driver.
[12:54.500 --> 12:58.500]  Oh yeah, I'm an awesome driver. Doesn't everybody say that?
[12:58.500 --> 13:04.500]  I don't. It's always the other guy. I know that there's, you know, because you had your license taken away.
[13:04.500 --> 13:11.500]  A phenomenal number of people. I do. It is true that if you like the Gallup poll, it's like, do you think you're an above average driver?
[13:11.500 --> 13:17.500]  And it's, it's like 95% of all people respond. I would respond. No, I'm, I'm a terrible driver.
[13:17.500 --> 13:27.500]  Who, so who there is your, do you have, I mean, everybody has like someone that you ridicule and drivers from some other place that you ridicule.
[13:27.500 --> 13:32.500]  Is it, is it Massachusetts? I mean, Massachusetts drivers, I think are roundly lousy drivers.
[13:32.500 --> 13:40.500]  They are the worst. We lived there for two years and we never, never ceased being astounded by how bad Massachusetts drivers are.
[13:40.500 --> 13:49.500]  But here in Philly, you don't see Massachusetts drivers very often because they, even if they tried to drive down here, they would get in some kind of accident by the time they get through New York.
[13:49.500 --> 13:59.500]  They never make it. So you don't see Massachusetts license plates this far south. Here, it's New Jersey drivers. New Jersey drivers are the worst.
[13:59.500 --> 14:11.500]  And it's because, uh, New Jersey, uh, pretty much, I mean, I'm not going to say nowhere, but they, they severely limit the number of places where you can make a left turn.
[14:11.500 --> 14:22.500]  So everything is, if you want to make a left, if you're on like a, like a, one of those, like a, you know, like a retail, like all sorts of big box stores.
[14:22.500 --> 14:33.500]  And the place you want to go, yeah, the place you want to go on is on the left. You've got to like figure out whether it's before you got to look for the sign where it'll tell you if you want to get over there, make a right here.
[14:33.500 --> 14:41.500]  And all of a sudden you're driving around people's houses and stuff, and then you'd come back out and then you waited a light so that you don't have to make the left.
[14:41.500 --> 14:51.500]  So New Jersey drivers are incapable of making a left turn when they're in a place where you can make a left turn. Like you could just see the panic in their faces as they try to make a left turn.
[14:51.500 --> 14:55.500]  Who is it for you?
[14:55.500 --> 15:04.500]  Here it's a, well, it, well, things are, are much more polite out here than, I mean, I grew up on the East coast, so I feel like I'm a bit of an East coast driver.
[15:04.500 --> 15:18.500]  But when, and when I moved out here, it was very surprising to me to learn a much more polighter way of driving because you let people merge and they wave to you after they merge.
[15:18.500 --> 15:34.500]  They wave thank you. And seriously, I think that happens less the longer that I've been here, maybe because of me, but it still happens, I would say, maybe half the time.
[15:34.500 --> 15:47.500]  And I think as far as people who we consider bad drivers, it's people from Canada because they drive on the other side of the road.
[15:47.500 --> 15:56.500]  Yeah, I was going to say, I think I actually know it's just, I mean, I think actually maybe it is people from Canada just because they're, you know, they're in someplace where they don't know.
[15:56.500 --> 16:01.500]  I mean, they're, they're from out of town and they're panicking. Yeah.
[16:01.500 --> 16:14.500]  I hope we now, who have we offended so far in the show? We've offended New Jerseyans, parents, children. I still forget. I lived there for two years and I still forget what you call people from Massachusetts.
[16:14.500 --> 16:34.500]  Massachusetts. It's not mass holes, mass holes. We've offended them. That was again, that was actually a one time we were in Massachusetts and it seemed to us, we really did see, it did seem this way that the way people merge in Massachusetts is they just get up to speed and hope that there's a slot.
[16:34.500 --> 16:47.500]  Yeah. Yeah. And one time we were, Amy saw this, I didn't see it, but she was behind this guy and she could see that there was a guy, you know, coming on the right on a ramp and he was keeping pace with the car in front of her.
[16:47.500 --> 16:58.500]  And she could see that they were getting closer and closer and she was like, who's going to move is the, you know, is this guy in front of me going to get over to the passing lane and let this guy in? Is that guy going to speed up?
[16:58.500 --> 17:08.500]  Is he going to, and instead they just slowly just bumped doors to each other and then put on their turn signals and went over to the side.
[17:08.500 --> 17:21.500]  And, uh, and Amy, I think she stopped. I really think she stopped because she was like, well, I'm a witness. Maybe I should stop too. And, and it was like they were just like, and nobody was mad at each other. Everybody was like, well, what are you going to do?
[17:21.500 --> 17:31.500]  And there were like, and the other thing was that there were no other cars on the road. It was like, it wasn't like busy traffic. It was like, well, we both did what we were supposed to do. Yeah.
[17:31.500 --> 17:41.500]  And they're like, what's, you know, it's, well, what are you going to do? I also remember my commute to bare bones was about 25 minutes.
[17:41.500 --> 17:56.500]  Uh, and you know, it was like flex time. So I could, I used to come in around, you know, 10 in the morning, 10 30 or so, um, to avoid traffic. And I could, it was, it was really kind of a nice drive. It was just a straight shot. You could go at highway speed. Traffic was all over.
[17:56.500 --> 18:12.500]  Um, and in the winter, every, I mean, it was like all the time in, in the, what do you call the, the thing, the grass between the two directions, the median median. Yeah. There would be SUVs in the, you know, that, that like rolled over in the bad weather.
[18:12.500 --> 18:29.500]  Like I've never seen, I, you, you'd think like one time maybe you'd see like an SUV on the side or something like that. And, and again, it was like, and, and it never seemed like anybody was hurt. There'd be people like standing and you know, winter coats and their cell phones. I was like, well, what are you going to do? My, my SUV flipped over.
[18:29.500 --> 18:32.500]  Yeah. People have no idea how to drive in the snow out here.
[18:32.500 --> 18:47.500]  Obviously we don't get it. People shouldn't get that off. They get so much snow. I think that it was always SUVs. I think it's this mentality where people think like an SUV is good in the snow because that's, you know, it's all terrain and four wheel drive or whatever.
[18:47.500 --> 19:01.500]  When in fact it's harder to drive in the snow. Cause it's so top heavy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. People don't, I mean, they don't, they don't understand, um, physics. Right. And the fact that it's, you know, the heavier car is it's harder to stop.
[19:01.500 --> 19:18.500]  Yeah. I can't wait for self driving cars. I'm I, I've, I wouldn't say I have a phobia. I think I, you know, but I, I do, I do feel like it's, it's kind of terrifying how many people get killed in car accidents. Like if you just look at the statistics, it really seems like something maybe we shouldn't do.
[19:18.500 --> 19:25.500]  Yeah. And yeah, I'm not sure. I don't know. Yeah. I mean, I hope it works out. Let's put it that way.
[19:25.500 --> 19:50.500]  I just feel like, I just feel like it's one of those things where it'll happen and then everybody's going to transition and then like the accident rates are going to plummet and we're going to look back at like, you know, the 75, 80 year period where everybody in North America was driving themselves everywhere and getting killed as like barbaric.
[19:50.500 --> 20:07.500]  Like what the hell? What the hell was that? Yeah. What were we doing? Um, I mean, I guess that guy who was killed driving the Tesla was, was sort of thinking that we were there already. Yeah. Yeah. That's an interesting story. He was, what was he doing? He was like watching Star Wars or Star Trek or something.
[20:07.500 --> 20:35.500]  I think, yeah, I think that's right. I think he was what I thought it was the Star Trek movie, but I can't, I can't remember. I mean, I'd really hate to laugh. I, I, you know, it's a tragedy. I mean, it's the guy's dead, but it, it, you know, it really seems to me like if I was going to trust that I would really, you know, that's where, you know, maybe you really read the manual and where it says very clearly, Hey, this is like, you've still take your hands off the wheel, right?
[20:35.500 --> 20:47.500]  You just rest your hands on the wheel and be alert and, you know, ready to take over at him in a moment. Well then I would think, okay, that's how I'll drive. You know, it's that it's sort of like cruise cruise control with turns.
[20:47.500 --> 21:03.500]  And, uh, it's just seems ridiculous. And it really, it kind of makes me mad because it's like, you know, you know, it's giving self driving cars, a bad name, you know, that there's a guy now there's a nut who got killed.
[21:03.500 --> 21:18.500]  Right. I've seen the videos. Have you seen the videos of people like doing that? I, I, you know, like I've seen like YouTube videos where guys like, and it's always guys, of course, start the Tesla thing going and then they like climb into the back seat.
[21:18.500 --> 21:34.500]  It's, it's crazy. Like just because, you know, I mean like they know they're going to get a lot of YouTube hits, right? Right. Yeah. But it's terrifying. It's worth risking your life. Right.
[21:34.500 --> 21:47.500]  Oh yeah. I fear that one day that'll be my kid. Yeah. I wonder if our kids are going to learn to drive. I don't know. You might because it's that self driving stuff might not come soon enough.
[21:47.500 --> 22:01.500]  But it doesn't seem like it's going to come real soon. But given that we live in a city, I don't know that Jonas would learn to drive anyway. You know? Yeah. Like a lot of, when I was in college, I knew a couple of kids who grew up in Philadelphia and they didn't know how to drive.
[22:01.500 --> 22:25.500]  And didn't care. And now, and Uber just makes it even, you know, more tenable to not know how to drive. Yeah. Yeah. I was, I was interested to see, we have some friends who, whose kids were, actually now that I think they're in college, but when I saw them like a year and a half ago, they were,
[22:25.500 --> 22:34.500]  just they were Ubering everything and they were basically just, and they were in high school and they were calling up Uber left and right. Yeah.
[22:34.500 --> 22:40.500]  It's definitely, definitely much more likely to do with the younger you are, I guess. Yeah.
[22:40.500 --> 22:56.500]  Let me take a break and thank our first sponsor. It's our good friends at audible.com. They have a 30 day free trial and you can go to audible.com slash talk show to get started. They've got an unmatched selection of audio books, original audio shows,

[24:05.500 --> 24:23.500]  Do you want a recommendation? Yeah, I would love a recommendation. I'm not listening to an audible right now, but it is available on audible. It's Leviathan Wakes. It's a science fiction book, and it's part of the Expanse series that is being made into a sci-fi show, which is really good.
[24:23.500 --> 24:39.500]  I just read a book on vacation. I guess I could recommend it. It's called Trigger Mortis. It's a James Bond novel written by Anthony Horowitz.
[24:39.500 --> 25:03.500]  And it's corny. They keep writing these James Bond novels. Ian Fleming's been dead, I think, 50 years. But this one's cool. It's set. It's not set in modern days. It's set two weeks after the end of Goldfinger. And Bond is still bouncing around with Pussy Galore at the beginning of the book.
[25:03.500 --> 25:11.500]  Huh. That's cool. Yeah, I enjoyed it. So, I mean, there's one. You know, go listen to that on audible.
[25:11.500 --> 25:28.500]  Hey, I saw a story. I wanted to know if you saw this. It was on The Verge about a week ago by Dieter Bohn. And the headline is, Google is making better apps for the iPhone than for Android.
[25:28.500 --> 25:38.500]  And it's talking about things like motion stills. Have you ever seen that app? That's the app where you can take your live photos and it kind of smooths them out and smooths out the motion.
[25:38.500 --> 25:43.500]  And lets you do things like turn them into animated gifs and videos.
[25:43.500 --> 25:46.500]  Yeah, I keep meaning to get that and I have not gotten that yet.
[25:46.500 --> 25:59.500]  It's a really, really good app. And I actually haven't. I don't know. I don't have iOS 10 installed on my phone yet. I don't have it on my iPad.
[25:59.500 --> 26:05.500]  But I don't think Apple did anything with live pictures in iOS.
[26:05.500 --> 26:16.500]  I really feel like this app is filling in something that should be built into iOS, which is turn these live photos, which I still think are a great feature.
[26:16.500 --> 26:24.500]  I tend to keep it on all the time because my phone has plenty of space. And why not capture more info?
[26:24.500 --> 26:31.500]  The only reason I can think of not to use live pictures is if you're worried about the extra space that they take up.
[26:31.500 --> 26:40.500]  But it's so hard to share. Some people find the image moving annoying, but I think you're right. It's probably mostly a space issue.
[26:40.500 --> 26:52.500]  Yeah, but it's just so curious to me that they didn't come up with a way to share them as, you know, I don't know if they do gifs, but it seems a little beneath Apple.
[26:52.500 --> 27:02.500]  But it's, you know, the magic of animated gifs is I still can't believe we're using these things. I mean, who would have thought the gif image format would make a comeback?
[27:02.500 --> 27:09.500]  256 colors. But being able to share them as a standard movie that you could post.
[27:09.500 --> 27:20.500]  Isn't it basically, is it not basically just a series of, you know, it's like a, whatever the, you know, the way they used to make movies. It's just a series of stills.
[27:20.500 --> 27:33.500]  No, it's not. It's, it's one high res, full, you know, the full resolution that you have your camera set to shoot at, still JPEG. And it's like a sidecar movie.mov file.
[27:33.500 --> 27:35.500]  No, well, you're talking about, I'm talking about animated gifs.
[27:35.500 --> 27:44.500]  Oh, animated gifs. Yes, animated gifs are just, yes, they're just, it's animated gifs image format is just, you know, take a bunch of stills.
[27:44.500 --> 27:45.500]  Right.
[27:45.500 --> 27:46.500]  And each one has a,
[27:46.500 --> 27:48.500]  Yeah, it's like a flip, it's like a flip book.
[27:48.500 --> 27:56.500]  Yeah. And you can set each, cause I remember as a web developer, oh my God, what was that? De-babilizer, remember that app?
[27:56.500 --> 27:57.500]  Oh yeah.
[27:57.500 --> 28:13.500]  You needed it because it was like, you know, it would, it would crush them down to like the minimum size and it would dither the colors in a really pleasing way and, you know, get, get it down to like six bytes or whatever, six kilobytes.
[28:13.500 --> 28:24.500]  And you could also set that the format it's, it's actually kind of a nice format except for the, you know, are nice in terms of being easily understandable, not nice and being high fidelity.
[28:24.500 --> 28:31.500]  But I think that each frame can have its own color palette.
[28:31.500 --> 28:38.500]  It's not like one color palette of 256 colors for the entire mission. I think that each one can do that.
[28:38.500 --> 28:42.500]  And you could also set how long the duration of each frame.
[28:42.500 --> 28:49.500]  So you can do things like say it's show this frame for one second, this frame for one second, but show this frame for three seconds.
[28:49.500 --> 28:50.500]  Right.
[28:50.500 --> 28:52.500]  I think, if I recall correctly.
[28:52.500 --> 29:03.500]  I think, no, I think that's, I think that's correct because I long, long ago I made some by hand and I don't remember why, but, and I don't, Jesus, I can't even remember what it was in.
[29:03.500 --> 29:10.500]  I think maybe it was back when I had a copy of Photoshop, which I don't have anymore, but I think you're, I think that's correct.
[29:10.500 --> 29:23.500]  But when I linked to it, the motion, Google's motion stills app, I laughed and made a point of saying, look at the comments because the comments are all from these people with Android phones saying, come on Google, this is ridiculous.
[29:23.500 --> 29:30.500]  You know, I can't believe you did this for iPhone and not Android.
[29:30.500 --> 29:32.500]  Even though Android doesn't have live photos.
[29:32.500 --> 29:34.500]  Doesn't have live photos.
[29:34.500 --> 29:49.500]  Right. And then somebody pointed that out and then somebody else said, well, there's one, there's one HTC phone that they, you know, they obviously can't call it live photos, but they have, it has the same, you know, same basic feature.
[29:49.500 --> 29:56.500]  So out of like 3000 Android phones, there's one that has it.
[29:56.500 --> 30:04.500]  But there's other apps too that people are talking about, you know, that there's, you know, just, and there's, he links to it here.
[30:04.500 --> 30:25.500]  There's a previous article from May about some other guy named Ben Popper at the Verge is, you know, whole, wholly invested in the Google ecosystem, but uses iOS and that he's, that their apps are so good that they, you know, he sees no reason to switch to Android that he, you know,
[30:25.500 --> 30:30.500]  does his email with the inbox app, Google calendar app.
[30:30.500 --> 30:37.500]  Oh, the other one too is the Google, there's the Google G board keyboard that a lot of people think is like the best third party keyboard for iOS.
[30:37.500 --> 30:39.500]  Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah.
[30:39.500 --> 30:42.500]  And it has some cool features.
[30:42.500 --> 30:56.500]  Some of them are coming in iOS 10, like the ability to type words and get the emoji, you know, suggestions, you know, like if you type coffee and maybe you'll get the, you know, one of the suggestions will be the coffee emoji.
[30:56.500 --> 31:12.500]  But there was another one. That's another one too, where, where, when Google announced the Google G board thing, the comments were half people saying this is great and half Android users saying, how can you make this for iOS and not for Android?
[31:12.500 --> 31:27.500]  But I'm curious what you think about that and why, why do you think it might be that, that Google does seemingly, you know, at least as good or as popular their apps are on iOS?
[31:27.500 --> 31:29.500]  You know, what's going on?
[31:29.500 --> 31:38.500]  Well, I don't know if it's still the case cause I haven't seen the numbers recently, but for a long time they were making more money off of iOS than they were off of Android.
[31:38.500 --> 31:42.500]  Advertising. Yeah, I believe that. Dollars. Right.
[31:42.500 --> 31:50.500]  So it would make more sense to invest more in the platform that's making you more money regardless of whether you made it or not.
[31:50.500 --> 32:18.500]  I think part of it is just the nature of Google itself that Google is to me, and maybe I'm wrong, but it's, it seems to me that Google is sort of a Federation of many, many products and teams and doesn't really have a single unifying, you know, this is the main thing that we do.
[32:18.500 --> 32:27.500]  You know, like it's the nature of it at Apple. The main thing that the company does is they sell devices like iPhones and iPads and Mac books.
[32:27.500 --> 32:39.500]  That's the main thing that they do and everything fundamentally at certain at some level really comes down to how do we, you know, keep making these devices and selling them at a profit at Microsoft.
[32:39.500 --> 32:53.500]  Microsoft is definitely changing. I think under, what's the new CEO's name? Satya Nadella. Definitely changing, but under Gates and Balmer, they were the Windows company fundamentally, and everything was about Windows.
[32:53.500 --> 33:14.500]  I think it's like to see this as wow, this is kind of amazing, you know, interesting or amazing that Google does such a good job with iOS apps is you're kind of, I think you have to look at Google like sort of through Microsoft tinted glasses that why isn't Google treating Android the way Microsoft treated Windows in its heyday?
[33:14.500 --> 33:24.500]  As like, you know, the shining star and let's do anything cool that we come up with. Let's make sure it's, you know, it's on Android first.
[33:24.500 --> 33:33.500]  And I don't think it works like that because I don't think there's any reason for Google to be like that.
[33:33.500 --> 33:48.500]  Yeah, it's not, I wouldn't call it like skunkworks, but it's kind of, I mean, their philosophy is much more open to seemingly to having these like side projects and then, you know, if that turns into something, yeah, we'll do something with it.
[33:48.500 --> 33:59.500]  Which, you know, I think, you know, like was the kind of thing that did not work at Apple back in the 90s. They were, you know, they were running around and people were working on these side projects that were going nowhere.
[33:59.500 --> 34:04.500]  But they seem to do much better with it.
[34:04.500 --> 34:19.500]  And I wonder too, it always, it's just, you know, I don't even know how you'd get this information, but it'd be so interesting to know. I would love to know like how many, like what percentage of Google employees, you know, use like iPhones instead of Android phones.
[34:19.500 --> 34:34.500]  My guess always has been that it's pretty high and, you know, I don't know a lot of people who work at Google. I'm not sure off the top of my head if I know anybody who works there now, but at least, you know, within the last few years, I knew some people who live there or work there.
[34:34.500 --> 34:39.500]  And the ones I knew had iPhones and I don't think that there is, there's no stigma attached to it.
[34:39.500 --> 34:50.500]  Yeah, I don't think so. I mean, I mean, the people that I knew were, well, no one was a software engineer and the other one was more like in the design stuff.
[34:50.500 --> 35:08.500]  So, yeah, I mean, I wouldn't, it doesn't seem like that is, you know, unlike that, that, you know, thing that Microsoft famously did where they had like, what did they have, like a bin that you're supposed to throw your iPhones into, like a garbage can or something.
[35:08.500 --> 35:14.500]  I don't think that too many people actually did it, but I remember when they switched to Windows Phone.
[35:14.500 --> 35:16.500]  Remember when they had the funeral for the iPhone?
[35:16.500 --> 35:18.500]  Yeah, that too.
[35:18.500 --> 35:28.500]  That might have been, that might have been the lowest point in the whole bomber era, the parade that they had for the funeral for the iPhone.
[35:28.500 --> 35:43.500]  Because it was so laughably not based in reality, you know, like there wasn't, it didn't feel like, hmm, maybe, you know, maybe Windows Phone is going to take this on.
[35:43.500 --> 35:58.500]  I never really thought so, but let's just like three years ago or so, like 2013, you know, was a rough year for Apple's stock and there were a lot of people who seemed to think at the time that Android was about to overwhelm iOS, right?
[35:58.500 --> 36:02.500]  Like the whole, this is exactly like Windows and Mac from the 90s again.
[36:02.500 --> 36:10.500]  And, you know, I think you can go back and read, you know, Daring Fireball from that era and you'd see that I didn't really think that was happening.
[36:10.500 --> 36:17.500]  But it seemed like it was at least possible. Like I never thought it was going to happen, but I didn't see it as like an impossibility.
[36:17.500 --> 36:21.500]  I saw it as, it doesn't seem, it seems to me like too many things are different here.
[36:21.500 --> 36:33.500]  And that, you know, one thing would be that, you know, that Apple's, even if they only have 15% of the market, that's a heck of a lot different than the 2% of the market they had in the 90s.
[36:33.500 --> 36:36.500]  And et cetera, et cetera, go on and on. There's all sorts of other differences.
[36:36.500 --> 36:44.500]  But it seemed like maybe, but the Windows Phone burying the iPhone didn't even seem like a possibility.
[36:44.500 --> 36:56.500]  Like, and you could see, you could see how from their perspective, I mean, you could, that they wanted to believe that and they needed to believe that in order to, you know, keep going.
[36:56.500 --> 37:02.500]  And also to try and make it, to have that sort of confidence work as a marketing tool.
[37:02.500 --> 37:15.500]  Yeah. But the thing that, you know, you remember these, these analyst predictions that came out around, boy, was it like 2013, 2012, maybe it was a little bit earlier than that.
[37:15.500 --> 37:21.500]  Saying that they, you know, they did, some of these analysts were predicting that, you know, Windows Phone was going to, was going to beat Android.
[37:21.500 --> 37:24.500]  Yes. Yeah. That was earlier. That was a little bit.
[37:24.500 --> 37:25.500]  Oh God.
[37:25.500 --> 37:26.500]  Yeah.
[37:26.500 --> 37:38.500]  I mean, like, how could you even, there was just like, there was just the simple belief that Microsoft being Microsoft would come out on top somehow.
[37:38.500 --> 38:00.500]  One of your and my shared preoccupations is, is with the world of analysts and, and the magic way that somebody who, if they're accepted as an analyst, if that is like the title that, you know, something, something analyst, if that's the title, when they go on CNBC,
[38:00.500 --> 38:13.500]  that whatever they say is there, you know, taken as, well, we can publish this as news, you know, that this is, this is something worth, you know, worth reporting when in fact it's off.
[38:13.500 --> 38:23.500]  Sometimes it might be, there are some analysts who are incredibly smart and astute and, and rigorous in their research and, and in the evidence that they show to back up their claims.
[38:23.500 --> 38:36.500]  And then there are others who just make stuff up and I remember that the, that the windows phone is going to, you know, surpass Android and, you know, be like the number one operating system by 2014 or 2015.
[38:36.500 --> 38:39.500]  It must've been a couple of years earlier than that. Cause I know we've already passed.
[38:39.500 --> 39:02.500]  Yeah. So this, the prediction was in May of 2011. Yeah. All right. You got to give it to me. And it was, it was yeah, it was pyramid research as Stella Boken. And she said that by 2013, windows phone was poised to overtake androids massive market share in two years.
[39:02.500 --> 39:04.500]  Oh my God.
[39:04.500 --> 39:14.500]  Cause somebody else had, had predicted it would be 2015 when, when it overtook. And she said, no, no, it's going to be two years earlier than that.
[39:14.500 --> 39:16.500]  It's going to happen fast.
[39:16.500 --> 39:20.500]  Yeah.
[39:20.500 --> 39:29.500]  I remember I looked her up again later and she's, she's not with pyramid research anymore, but she still is. She's still, she's still working in the industry.
[39:29.500 --> 39:39.500]  Not, not a, not a debilitating, not a career ending move. I wonder what, what phones people use at Microsoft now today too. That's an interesting question because they really are.
[39:39.500 --> 39:54.500]  It seems to me very clear that they are slowly winding down the whole windows phone thing. Like I'm not, I don't know that they're ever going to quite give up on it completely, but it just seems like they don't even, they're not even trying anymore.
[39:54.500 --> 39:55.500]  Yeah.
[39:55.500 --> 40:09.500]  I mean, you don't hear about it at all. It just seems to me like if you were a good company person and bought a windows phone, like you're just left out of so many things, right? Yeah. No Pokemon go for you. I'm going to say, yeah, there's no Pokemon go, right? Right.
[40:09.500 --> 40:20.500]  It's, I just can't help but think that they're mostly iPhones. I really do. And it's kind of such a weird thing for Microsoft. I don't think it's so weird for Google, but it's weird for Microsoft.
[40:20.500 --> 40:32.500]  Well, they, but they, I mean, at least they have, their philosophy has changed to the degree that they don't have that windows only mentality anymore. So they are making, and they're making some good apps for multiple platforms.
[40:32.500 --> 40:38.500]  So, I mean, I still don't like office, but I have to use it sometimes.
[40:38.500 --> 40:40.500]  Do you ever use it for iOS?
[40:40.500 --> 40:58.500]  Yeah. Yeah. Actually, and you know, I mostly for my kid when he needs to do, cause they get a license for free through his school. So, often he's got an iPad that he will like write reports on with, you know, with the attached keyboard and, and do, and do it in word.
[40:58.500 --> 41:05.500]  And they will, you know, they make presentations in PowerPoint and stuff like that. And I, I'll often help them out with that stuff.
[41:05.500 --> 41:08.500]  Yeah. My kid's school is a Google doc school.
[41:08.500 --> 41:09.500]  Okay.
[41:09.500 --> 41:18.500]  And it's such garbage. I mean, it makes you, it makes me wish it makes me wish for a Microsoft office. It's, I really,
[41:18.500 --> 41:20.500]  Do they use Chromebooks?
[41:20.500 --> 41:36.500]  They, they have some in some of the classrooms. They do have some, which makes total sense as a Google doc school. You know, I think, I guess maybe most of the, I guess most of the devices the kids have access to are Chromebooks.
[41:36.500 --> 41:53.500]  Yeah. And it makes, I mean, you know, I would rather have a MacBook any day, but you know, you, our friends at MEH often will sell refurbished Chromebooks and they're so crazy cheap. It's, I keep, I often think I should get one just to play around with it.
[41:53.500 --> 41:57.500]  But then I think even like even $175 is too much.
[41:57.500 --> 42:13.500]  I don't know. I know I do that like every two years or so I buy an Android phone. Yeah. And I wish I would have got the Nexus six. Instead I got the Motorola wood chipper or whatever it's called.
[42:13.500 --> 42:30.500]  The one it's got a, it's like the Moto X or something like that, but it's, it, you could get like a custom finish on the back. So I got the bamboo. It's really made up my, my, this file is in my hand right now. It's made out of wood, which is interesting, but it's, it's so not a nice phone.
[42:30.500 --> 42:47.500]  I saw a guy at WWDC. My friend Chad from MLB has two phones. He has an iPhone and he added Android cause he has to test the MLB stuff on Android too. And he has the Nexus six. It's really nice. It's, you know, it's much thinner than the, this Moto thing.
[42:47.500 --> 43:00.500]  But anyway, I don't see it as a waste of money. I feel like it's, it's a way to stay where I'm fearful of, of not knowing it. And I have to say I am pretty, I've never really used a Chromebook. I kind of feel like I should, I should spend 200 bucks and get one.
[43:00.500 --> 43:18.500]  Well, keep an eye on meth cause you know, you can, you can get a refurb for real cheap. I mean, you know, from a school's perspective, that makes complete sense. I mean, if you've got to get something that, and the kids are basically just going to do write reports and look things up and you don't want them playing games for the most part.
[43:18.500 --> 43:40.500]  So those devices are perfect. I mean, it's kind of like, it's almost, you remember that, that whole OLPC thing. Yes. Yeah. It's really succeeded at that where that did not, didn't seem to really get much traction. Yeah. What was that one laptop per child?
[43:40.500 --> 44:07.500]  Yeah. Yeah. And it was just, you know, it was, it was just a piece of garbage. Whereas, but maybe, you know, I think a big part of that was, it's not that Google has any kind of magic. I think it's just Moore's law, you know, like Moore's law is famously, you know, sort of come to an end at the high end where, you know, the clock rate on high end CPU's isn't really getting faster.
[44:07.500 --> 44:22.500]  And, you know, there's only so much that adding more chips to parallelize can really improve. But at the low end, it continues to March on where better and better hardware is available at cheaper and cheaper prices.
[44:22.500 --> 44:38.500]  Yeah. I think the one thing that are you going to get, are you going to get yourself a Samsung spin? No, I don't think so. I don't think so. Did you like that? That's a bridge too far.
[44:38.500 --> 44:59.500]  That's it. We can hold that topic. That's an interesting topic. But yeah, the Chromebooks for school. I do see this. And, you know, Jonas says that the ones that they have are terrible and that, you know, everybody hates them. But I see the way kids treat stuff in school and they don't really treat it with respect. Like Apple doesn't really make a device that's good for a school to buy.
[44:59.500 --> 45:14.500]  I mean, if the cheapest thing you can get is an $899 MacBook Air, that's a pretty expensive thing that kids are going to, you know, bang around and drop and stuff like that. Like, I think, you know, the idea that they're at a $200 is not disposable.
[45:14.500 --> 45:27.500]  And I'm sure that anybody who works in any kind of school is going to, you know, say, yeah, 200 bucks is, you know, you know, I know budgets are tight at schools everywhere, but, you know, it just makes a lot more sense.
[45:27.500 --> 45:29.500]  Yeah. Without a doubt.
[45:29.500 --> 45:38.500]  Boy, Google Docs, though, I find it. I don't even understand. I honestly I don't understand the UI. I really don't. It's just doesn't work for me.
[45:38.500 --> 45:45.500]  I mean, it seems like it's, you know, very reminiscent of those open source office.
[45:45.500 --> 45:49.500]  Yes. Yeah, that's what I that's how exactly how I would describe it.
[45:49.500 --> 46:02.500]  Yeah. And I'm I don't use it much. I mean, when I'm on the they use it like in the incomparable to do scheduling and and some and some sharing of like topics for podcasts.
[46:02.500 --> 46:12.500]  So when I'm on clockwise, I always that's the that's the only time I ever have to use it is because Jason uses a Google spreadsheet to.
[46:12.500 --> 46:18.500]  Yeah. You know, you're supposed to log in and put your what your topic is for clockwise. Oh, my God. That's the only time I ever.
[46:18.500 --> 46:24.500]  We have to do it like that. I don't do I mean, let's face it. I hope Amy doesn't listen to this.
[46:24.500 --> 46:31.500]  I think that, you know, she would agree. I I don't do much of the parenting. She does a lot more of the parenting than I do.
[46:31.500 --> 46:46.500]  And with stuff like dealing with the school, I really do none of it. But it's like every once in a while when there's some kind of shared, you know, parents are involved or a perfect example would be the teacher conferences, parent teacher conferences.
[46:46.500 --> 46:53.500]  You got to get into Google Docs, though, and like sign up for a time. And it's so, so bad.
[46:53.500 --> 47:06.500]  But I understand why they do it, though, because it is a you know, it works as a shared spreadsheet where you're not going to run into a race condition where three people signed up for the one p.m. teacher conference.
[47:06.500 --> 47:14.500]  Right. Like as I type John and Amy in the one p.m. slot, anybody else is in there would see it, see those letters showing up.
[47:14.500 --> 47:19.500]  So I understand that. I understand the utility of it is why people don't please don't write in and tell me that that's why you use that.
[47:19.500 --> 47:26.500]  I totally get it. That as as a shared resource, it is you know, it it works. There's no sinking collisions.
[47:26.500 --> 47:31.500]  But as somebody who cares about the interface, boy, it's a nightmare.
[47:31.500 --> 47:39.500]  So the other factor we were talking about the Google's iOS apps and how popular they are and how people who are in the Google ecosystem with their data.
[47:39.500 --> 47:47.500]  Well, it's a pretty good segue. Feel perfectly at home using an iPhone instead of an Android phone.
[47:47.500 --> 47:59.500]  And the other flip side of that is why I don't use any of those apps other than the motion stills one, which just because of the utility to share the live photos.
[47:59.500 --> 48:13.500]  As our good friend Jason Snell pointed out, like a month or so ago, that Google's apps are sort of he compared them to Microsoft of like the late 90s where their Mac apps started looking like the Windows app.
[48:13.500 --> 48:28.500]  And in fact, I think they even went to some kind of a shared code system for some things, you know, where they were sort of a cross platform, you know, look and feel type type stuff in office apps.
[48:28.500 --> 48:35.500]  And Google's apps are all that's the reason I don't use them is that they're that none of them look like iOS apps. They all look like Android apps.
[48:35.500 --> 48:44.500]  So there is that, you know, like if there's one thing it seems to me like Google institutionally isn't really all that committed to Android.
[48:44.500 --> 48:59.500]  Android might as well be a completely separate company, except what the one thing Google is committed to company wide is the material design look and feel whether they're doing stuff for the web or iOS or Android.
[48:59.500 --> 49:06.500]  They're committed to that style of UI design. That's where they have like a commitment. And that, you know, annoys me.
[49:06.500 --> 49:08.500]  Yeah.
[49:08.500 --> 49:12.500]  What about you? You say use any Google apps?
[49:12.500 --> 49:15.500]  Every once in a while I use the Gmail app.
[49:15.500 --> 49:18.500]  But.
[49:18.500 --> 49:25.500]  I'm trying to think, like I said, I want to I want to get that one, that one that makes the animated gifs, but I haven't gotten around to it.
[49:25.500 --> 49:35.500]  And, gosh, Hank, mostly my son, mostly uses he's got a Gmail account for email and he mostly uses the Google app for that.
[49:35.500 --> 49:36.500]  Oh, interesting.
[49:36.500 --> 49:41.500]  Yeah, I think it's it's just it seems easier.
[49:41.500 --> 49:46.500]  If you have a Gmail account, it feels much more straightforward than trying to to get it through mail.
[49:46.500 --> 49:48.500]  Yeah.
[49:48.500 --> 49:51.500]  What do you use for email on iOS?
[49:51.500 --> 49:52.500]  I mostly use mail.
[49:52.500 --> 50:00.500]  I almost like 99 percent just use mail every once in a while. If search fails me, then I use Gmail or something.
[50:00.500 --> 50:06.500]  And I've tried a number of those other applications. But, you know, you seem to always get I've been burned too many times.
[50:06.500 --> 50:11.500]  Right. I mean, because Sparrow and whatever the other one was.
[50:11.500 --> 50:18.500]  Yeah, I forget the one that was like the online you could consolidate all your inboxes or what the hell is the name of that one?
[50:18.500 --> 50:21.500]  They both got bought. Right. Yeah.
[50:21.500 --> 50:24.500]  And went away.
[50:24.500 --> 50:31.500]  The only one I've seen that really tempt me tempted me and I still have it here is called Spark.
[50:31.500 --> 50:35.500]  Do you ever see that one? No, it's because to me, it's.
[50:35.500 --> 50:41.500]  The thing that's nice about Spark is that it looks like an iOS app.
[50:41.500 --> 50:45.500]  It looks like a very, you know, a very nice I'll put it in the show notes.
[50:45.500 --> 50:49.500]  I think it's from Seattle. The people who make.
[50:49.500 --> 50:54.500]  Are known for like making PDF utilities.
[50:54.500 --> 51:03.500]  But if you just take a look at the screenshots of Spark for iPhone, you could see that it's like, oh, yes, that looks like.
[51:03.500 --> 51:07.500]  That looks like a nice iOS app.
[51:07.500 --> 51:11.500]  And here's a news story. I just googled it. Here's I logged in and they've been acquired.
[51:11.500 --> 51:16.500]  It's sparks been canceled. No spark email. I just is from eight hours ago. Here's breaking news.
[51:16.500 --> 51:23.500]  This is a bizarre coincidence that.
[51:23.500 --> 51:31.500]  Some kind of thing where people, if you're using it with your iCloud email, you have to re log in for security reasons.
[51:31.500 --> 51:35.500]  And it made people panic and think that maybe Spark had gotten hacked or something.
[51:35.500 --> 51:39.500]  That's not true. There is no hack, but it's.
[51:39.500 --> 51:46.500]  They switched something on their server side at AWS, and that made Apple or iCloud freak out.
[51:46.500 --> 51:52.500]  And therefore just say, hey, everybody, you know, you got to re log in anyway to good app.
[51:52.500 --> 51:58.500]  And if you're dissatisfied with mail, highly, highly recommend you take a look at it because it's a really good iOS app.
[51:58.500 --> 52:05.500]  But the thing for me is I like mail, especially on iOS. I just, you know, works very well for me for email.
[52:05.500 --> 52:10.500]  I understand people can be very picky about their email, but for me, mail is pretty good.
[52:10.500 --> 52:17.500]  Anything my my needs are not complicated, particularly truth be told, I don't even read most of my email.
[52:17.500 --> 52:22.500]  So really, Apple mail works just fine.
[52:22.500 --> 52:27.500]  Delete, delete, delete. Merlin listens to the show.
[52:27.500 --> 52:31.500]  I think it's too late now, so I don't think I'll ever use it.
[52:31.500 --> 52:36.500]  But when Merlin had the inbox zero thing.
[52:36.500 --> 52:42.500]  Yeah, I thought about making a parody. I think I still own the domain.
[52:42.500 --> 52:49.500]  I was going to make a parody and it was called Select All Delete.
[52:49.500 --> 53:00.500]  And it was going to go into it was a good service site that detailed my patented email management system for keeping your inbox empty.
[53:00.500 --> 53:06.500]  My step by step, my inbox management is to simply not delete anything.
[53:06.500 --> 53:10.500]  Every single step of the process would be given an exquisite detail.
[53:10.500 --> 53:14.500]  And the URL is select all delete dot com.
[53:14.500 --> 53:20.500]  Yeah. Yeah. I think I think my inbox is up to six thousand right now.
[53:20.500 --> 53:26.500]  I mean, they're all red, but they just don't go anywhere.
[53:26.500 --> 53:31.500]  I'm not going to mention the name of this developer because it would be uncouth.
[53:31.500 --> 53:39.500]  But a couple of years ago, we were at WWDC and I was with Cable Sasser of Panic and we were talking about this.
[53:39.500 --> 53:46.500]  This other developer had some very popular apps and Cable had just run into him the day before.
[53:46.500 --> 53:54.500]  And after WWDC, he was going to go on like a six week hiking trip through New Zealand, something like that.
[53:54.500 --> 54:01.500]  It sounded like, you know, if you want to be by yourself is like, you know, somewhere beautiful, six weeks, all hiking.
[54:01.500 --> 54:05.500]  And Cable was under the impression that he was like a one man show, this other guy.
[54:05.500 --> 54:09.500]  You know, and he was like, oh, I thought, you know, did you hire people? He's like, no.
[54:09.500 --> 54:19.500]  He goes, well, what are you going to do for technical support? And he just looked at Cable and he just said, select all delete.
[54:19.500 --> 54:26.500]  He's just going to delete every email like he might have even it might have been that I forget the details,
[54:26.500 --> 54:32.500]  but he was dead serious, wasn't joking, didn't see anything unusual or interesting about that.
[54:32.500 --> 54:37.500]  He might have even set up like an auto, you know, like he just set up a filter to just throw everything in.
[54:37.500 --> 54:40.500]  You know, he went and he wasn't sending out like an automate.
[54:40.500 --> 54:43.500]  He didn't set up anything that say like, I'm going to be away for six weeks. Get back to you.
[54:43.500 --> 54:54.500]  Then he just deleted them all. Yeah, I mean, I see the I see the the appeal and I see, you know, as a as someone else is like the only person in my business.
[54:54.500 --> 55:00.500]  Right. Like I just I don't take I don't never take a complete vacation.
[55:00.500 --> 55:09.500]  That is true. That's very constantly writing wherever, you know, if I'm on my phone on vacation, I'm still writing the bare minimum that I have to get by.
[55:09.500 --> 55:15.500]  I'll reduce it, but I and often I'll stop podcasting. Yes. Take a break from podcasts.
[55:15.500 --> 55:25.500]  But but I still have to write something. I don't know why I mentally I find it I find it hard to do a podcast when I'm not at home.
[55:25.500 --> 55:34.500]  Like, I don't know why all I have to do is pack a microphone, you know, and there's you know, I don't need like I've got this fancy one hanging on a, you know, bendable arm here at my desk here.
[55:34.500 --> 55:40.500]  But I don't you know, you don't need a podcast. You know, you just use like any you know, you get one for like 15 bucks.
[55:40.500 --> 55:48.500]  I have one. I even have a portable one, but it's like so old that it uses remember the the before micro USB.
[55:48.500 --> 56:03.500]  There was like a mini USB. Mm hmm. And I don't Yeah, it takes it. It takes a mini USB, but many USB is so outdated that I can't find a cable for I mean, I'm sure I have one somewhere in my closet.
[56:03.500 --> 56:12.500]  There's you know, but it's like, at this point, my last used mini USB cable is so far down the stack of cables that it doesn't seem worth looking it up.
[56:12.500 --> 56:22.500]  But mentally, I don't know, I find it difficult. I've done it. I remember the one that I did the episode with Dan Benjamin with the boats going off.
[56:22.500 --> 56:32.500]  Yes, and a duck there. Yeah, you're like dialed in, right? Yeah. You were just doing it from your phone. No, I think I think I know. I don't think it sounded like you were just doing it.
[56:32.500 --> 56:43.500]  I might have. I forget how I did it. It was it was low fidelity and there were boats and a duck. It was actually kind of fun, but I don't know. I find it hard.
[56:43.500 --> 56:55.500]  Yeah. Yeah. John John Armstrong. It's it's, you know, turning this car around it. He's he's pretty particular about about sound.
[56:55.500 --> 57:05.500]  I can imagine I just had dinner with him every time I think about like, oh, I could just take my little microphone and then I think, oh, he's not gonna like that. I just John was in Philly six weeks ago or something like that.
[57:05.500 --> 57:17.500]  Maybe longer. I don't know. But sometime within the last two months and Amy and I went out with them and he's, you know, we've known him for years. You've obviously known better, but I can definitely imagine that he's a little tightly wound about something like that.
[57:17.500 --> 57:26.500]  He's he's we're all obsessive. I mean, all of us are obsessive or some things, but when he gets obsessed about something, it's like, yeah, yeah.
[57:26.500 --> 57:36.500]  And I think, you know, I think it's good. I mean, like he makes it sound better. He makes the show sound better. So and it's bled over into other show.
[57:36.500 --> 57:49.500]  I mean, I've spent more. I've spent more on equipment and I haven't spent a lot, but I've spent a little bit more and I've also like been I mean, like I'm I'm recording on two machines right now.
[57:49.500 --> 58:00.500]  Because of problems we've had in the past. Let me take another break here and thank our next sponsor. It is the Ministry of Supply.
[58:00.500 --> 58:09.500]  As humans, we sweat. I told you guys how hot it is here in Philadelphia. I'm sweating like a pig right now. Very rarely does sweating take place at convenient times.
[58:09.500 --> 58:15.500]  Gym clothes can handle it, but the clothes we wear to work, aka the majority of the day, every day, do nothing to help.
[58:15.500 --> 58:23.500]  They're stiff and restricting and only add to the problem. Ministry of Supply has set out to fix this. Their brand combines performance technology.
[58:23.500 --> 58:31.500]  They're taking the fabrics of like modern gym clothes and making men's work wear that's actually comfortable and capable.
[58:31.500 --> 58:39.500]  You take a look at it. You'd never get doesn't look different. Looks just like very stylish suits, slacks, shirts.
[58:39.500 --> 58:53.500]  Just looks like regular modern, very stylish dress clothes. But they make all of this stuff out of really modern fabrics that breathe wicks, sweat and stretch as you move.
[58:53.500 --> 59:01.500]  Just go take a look. It's the URL is Ministry of Supply dot com slash talk show. Just just go take a look. You'll see it.
[59:01.500 --> 59:07.500]  They even have retail stores. They have stores in Boston and San Francisco and coming soon. Washington, D.C.
[59:07.500 --> 59:18.500]  And if you go into one of the retail stores in one of those fine cities, just mention the same thing that the code talk show and say you heard it on a podcast and you'll get the same 15 percent discount that you can get at that Web site.
[59:18.500 --> 59:28.500]  So you go to Ministry of Supply dot com slash talk show 15 percent off. If you use that code talk show, you can get it in the retail store to added bonus.
[59:28.500 --> 59:34.500]  All of their clothes are machine washable. You don't you don't have to go to the dry cleaner just to get the wrinkles out of your shirt.
[59:34.500 --> 59:42.500]  Just really, really great stuff. I mean, here's just one example. They call it the Apollo dress shirt. It is NASA invented fibers that regulate body temperature based on your surroundings.
[59:42.500 --> 59:51.500]  Keeps you warm in the winter, cool in the summer. Really kind of ties into what I was talking about earlier in the show. I didn't really a very happy coincidence.
[59:51.500 --> 01:00:01.500]  But anyway, check them out. Sounds great to me. Sounds like a great idea. And if you've ever seen those modern fabrics that they use on modern gym clothes, you know what I'm talking about.
[01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:10.500]  It's great stuff. So go check them out. Love having a sponsor like that on the show. Go check them out.
[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:18.500]  What else is going on? Pokemon Go. Yeah. Have you. Have you. Pokemon went. I did not. I have not played.
[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:26.500]  Jonas is totally as expected, totally into it. And so I had him explain it to me and he showed it to me.
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:38.500]  And I felt like that was good enough for me. Yeah. I have played. We have played. So it's a thing we've been involved in in the household.
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:48.500]  And, you know, like I've said, numerous different places. But it's been great because he's, you know, I mean, often a kid doesn't want to go for a walk.
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:57.500]  Right. Like getting him off the couch and again, going out, tying into our previous conversation this time. Yeah. Right. Right. And this now he's just like, you want to go.
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:14.500]  You just say, well, go look for some Pokemon. Yeah, let's go. And my experience, you know, I haven't gone out and tried to do it at like midnight, but walking around in town and going to places has been has been fun.
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:20.500]  And seeing other people and and very social. Everybody's been most everybody's been nice.
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:28.500]  We were walking and walking along the waterfront with some friends looking for Pokemon and and a whole bunch of other people were doing the same.
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:37.500]  And, you know, like a Jeep SUV drove by and this girl leaned out the window and yelled, nerds.
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:45.500]  So, you know, not everybody's nice, but for the most part, everybody's been very pleasant to deal with, which has been great.
[01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:58.500]  I don't think that we've run into anybody else who is playing or, you know, we were doing it where I said we were down at Disney World and we were playing there, which was fun, but we didn't run into other people who were playing.
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:11.500]  Interesting. I mean, yeah, because we have I mean, pretty much every the one day we walked out one time early on and just like walked around the house and obviously we didn't run any we didn't run anybody then.
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:25.500]  But every time we've gone to like a place like even just like going to the shopping districts district that's like six blocks from here, there were at least two other groups of people who were playing the game.
[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:29.500]  That's amazing. It's unbelievable how quickly it's taken off.
[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.500]  Oh, man, it's just it's astounding.
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:37.500]  So there's a previous game. What was it called? Ingress? Is that what it was called?
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.500]  I don't know.
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:40.500]  Ingress?
[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:47.500]  Yeah, it's the same company.
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:50.500]  I N G R E S S.
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.500]  So that was that was also made by Niantic?
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:03:02.500]  Yes. And it's the same. I'm not gonna say it's exactly the same, but it's, you know, it's sort of like Pokemon Go 1.0, you know, and this is like the 2.0.
[01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:11.500]  And it's got the same sort of thing where you can level up and stuff like that. And, you know, this same basic idea. If you I'll put a thing on the show.
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:19.500]  I always say that I never do.
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:32.500]  I'd heard of it vaguely. And a couple of Daring Fireball readers have, you know, emailed me after I wrote about Pokemon Go and said that they, you know, they were really into Ingress and said that it's, you know, it's really interesting story.
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:36.500]  It used to be owned by Google, the company, this Niantic.
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:42.500]  And then they got spun off for reasons that are unclear to me.
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:50.500]  But it's the same basic idea. And it's like you walk around staring at your phone.
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:55.500]  I haven't walked into anything yet, although I did annoy somebody in a parking lot.
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.500]  How?
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:08.500]  By just walking. Well, I was walking through the parking lot, not paying attention, and suddenly I realized there was a car behind me and I was like, Oh, okay, I gotta get out of the way.
[01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:18.500]  I think it's so interesting, though. And I know that Niantic is the company that developed it and that it's based on their previous game, Ingress.
[01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:24.500]  But it is, you know, it's Nintendo that has the, you know, video game rights to Pokemon.
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:30.500]  And so I do think it's still, even if Nintendo didn't actually develop the app, you know, they produced it.
[01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:41.500]  I think that they, you know, it's worth talking about Nintendo and mobile games again. And this is, you know, I don't want to say I was, yeah, I do want to say that I was right.
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:50.500]  But this is, it's exactly the sort of thing, though, that I thought, I've thought Nintendo should do for mobile phones for years, which is not port.
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:59.500]  And every time when this came up a couple of years ago, or at least it came up for me, and it was a back and forth with a few other people on other blogs.
[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:12.500]  It's like, I feel like the black hole that discussion keeps getting kept getting sucked down to was that DS games are terrible without a real D-pad and buttons.
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:20.500]  And I agree with that. I totally see, you know, that like Mario Kart, you know, unless you somehow did, you know, you'd have to have different controls.
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:24.500]  You'd have to have like motion controls or something.
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:33.500]  And that other games like platformers or something like that are never as good with a fake, the fake D-pad on a, on an iPhone.
[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:40.500]  And so that's not my argument. My argument isn't that they should get rid of the DS and port all their DS games to a touchscreen.
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:53.500]  It's, you know, we'll come up with new game ideas that work on a touchscreen and do the Pokemon Go thing is I couldn't be more exactly what I was thinking that they should do and do things, you know, like, well, you've got GPS and you've got a camera.
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:57.500]  So why don't you do something with that? And it's, you know, really, really clever.
[01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:01.500]  Yeah. It's, it's, it's also very buggy.
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:02.500]  Oh, is it really?
[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:03.500]  Oh, yes.
[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:04.500]  Jonas hasn't complained about that.
[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:13.500]  Oh, really? Well, at least it's been, it's been very buggy for, for me and, you know, and my friends were playing as well.
[01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:19.500]  And also the terrible thing I think is that it's, and then they had the problem with the, with the Gmail or the Google account.
[01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:19.500]  Yeah.
[01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:26.500]  So you can sign in, you can, you can become a member of the Pokemon trainers club by going to this website, which I had no success for days.
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:29.500]  And then finally I was just like, I'm just going to hit refresh, refresh, refresh.
[01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:37.500]  And finally I got in and was able to create an account, which I wanted to do because I had signed in originally with the Google account.
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:43.500]  And then, you know, it was revealed that it was granting way too much access.
[01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:56.500]  So I wanted to set up the trainer account, trainer club account, and I finally got in, but the, but the problem is their servers are so overwhelmed, I guess that we, when we were out and about.
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:58.500]  At one point, first of all, it was very hard to create the account.
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:03.500]  Second of all, when we were out that it would just, it would not, it would not be able to connect.
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:06.500]  So it would log you out of the game and you wouldn't be able to play.
[01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:16.500]  So I finally, and at that time I was like, okay, I'm just getting, you know, they had released the patch for the, to reduce the amount of access that it had to your Google account.
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:20.500]  So I thought, okay, I'll just go sign back in with my Google account. And that worked fine.
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:26.500]  It seems so curious to me that they would, that they would have this, you know, privacy.
[01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:34.500]  I don't think it was a security bug, but it was definitely a privacy hole where they were, you know, taking too much access to your Google account.
[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:41.500]  It's so curious to me though, that the company used to be part of Google. You know, you'd think if anybody would get this right, it would be them.
[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:52.500]  And I know, you know, firsthand everybody who's ever made any kind of online thing, like identity is such a weird, there is no good answer to the identity problem.
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:58.500]  I mean, rolling your own versus, you know, letting people sign in with Twitter or Google or Facebook or whatever.
[01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:09.500]  There's flip sides to all of it. I know that it's difficult. I mean, Vespersync is about as simple as it could be, but it was still a big hassle developing it.
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:20.500]  And then, I mean, beyond, so beyond those things, though, there are also numerous instances where we would capture a Pokemon and then it would just freeze.
[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:29.500]  Oh, and you'd have to restart the app to get back in and then it would not, you know, it wouldn't remember that you had caught that Pokemon.
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:37.500]  So that was obviously kind of annoying. But the thing that is so amazing, though, is that despite these problems, it's still so crazy popular.
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:41.500]  And those problems haven't even stopped, you know, haven't stopped us from playing either.
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:45.500]  Explain to me what people are buying with the in-app purchases.
[01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:54.500]  I'm not. Well, you I mean, you're buying credits. First of all, you're buying like coin kind of things that you can spend on different things.
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:09:02.500]  One of the things that you can buy, you can get you can buy more pokeballs to capture more Pokemon, although we have a we have a poke stop up at the end of the street.
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:10.500]  So I don't and don't feel like I have to worry about and I don't play it so much that I'm using that many pokeballs.
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:19.500]  I don't understand. I'm not sure what else you can buy. I'm assuming that you can buy things like eggs so that you can incubate your your Pokemon and maybe incense to attract Pokemon.
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:29.500]  And maybe maybe you can also buy lures and things like that. So I'm assuming that it's that you can spend coins on things of that nature.
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:35.500]  But I haven't I haven't bought anything that this part of my brain has obviously just atrophy.
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:47.500]  I don't know if if I killed it with alcohol, but the part of my game that is supposed to be that supposed to listen to this and say that sounds like a lot of fun is just totally gone.
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:57.500]  And I think there was a time where I would have. See, I don't think it's quite like, you know, others, people who hate sports or just did sports just does nothing for them.
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:01.500]  And so they kind of hate sports because whenever anybody else is talking about it, it's just blah, blah, blah.
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:08.500]  You know, they don't they don't get it. I used to love video games. I really did.
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:17.500]  And it just somehow it just it just died off. But the idea that you're spending real money to get incense for to lure Pokemon.
[01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:26.500]  They're not real. Well, yeah, I mean, I don't I don't like that.
[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:36.500]  That model, I know, but it's but it is what we're a model. I like paying for the game up front. I mean, you know, the other game that I bought was recently was the Lego Star Wars, The Force Awakens.
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:43.500]  Oh, we got that. We've played like crazy, too, which is super fun and is a fixed up front.
[01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:51.500]  Yes, fee. And I am much more comfortable with that. And that's why I don't that's why I don't buy.
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:11:01.500]  Stuff. Yeah, those are the only games that I've really I would say in the last 10 years that at least 95 percent of my video game playing time has been on the Lego games.
[01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:11.500]  Yeah. Yeah. The crazy thing that we found was that the speaking of Nintendo, that's the one and maybe there's one other platform.
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:27.500]  I think maybe the Xbox, like the Xbox 360 version in the Wii U version of Lego Star Wars, The Force Awakens does not you can't even buy the season pass to get the extra characters and stuff.
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:34.500]  It's only the basic. So we we bought it and I was thinking, oh, and then we played, you know, played through it pretty quickly.
[01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:41.500]  And we're like, oh, let's buy the season passed and get the extra stuff. Oh, we can't. That's weird.
[01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:51.500]  So it's like we got it and we got an eye on iOS and it's not all out on iOS yet, but supposedly that stuff will will will get eventually released on iOS.
[01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:59.500]  I like those games. Yeah, I'm not a fan of the modern ones, though, where they start they've started talking. I like.
[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:08.500]  Well, this is the one exception, I think. And the reason I think it's an exception in this case is because they recorded a whole bunch of new material for the game.
[01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:18.500]  The thing that I think I agreed with that in the past. I always liked when they were just making noises instead of using dialogue from the movies.
[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:34.500]  But I think they've they've upped their game significantly now because with this game, they got everybody, including Harrison Ford, and recorded a whole bunch of new material and stuff that is actually related to the gameplay.
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:43.500]  So they'll say things like we need to get over there to connect those two things so that we can open the gate to get through or whatever.
[01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:50.500]  You know, I mean, that's actually they're talking about stuff that you need to do in the game in order to advance.
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:59.500]  And Andy, and I think it's cool to be able to hear, you know, it's the characters that you love from the movie and you're getting to hear more of them.
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:08.500]  Well, I'm glad to hear you say that they did they did it well. I just I still feel that I missed the old style where they they just emoted, you know, sort of like The Sims, I think.
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:17.500]  You know, I think it's a fair comparison where they would just, you know, quote unquote, speak with these mumbles that were like universal language.
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:32.500]  So they wouldn't have to, you know, and it to me, it was an interesting thing as a to think about the writing challenge of making it very clear that when the character was that, you know, what what he's upset about because he can't actually say words.
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:43.500]  So you have to be really, really clear with the game design and the writing, which I think helped them. I helped it like focus on, you know, making everything as clear as possible.
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:52.500]  And I just thought it was, you know, like a cool thing. Yeah. And it must feel I feel like the reason the main reason, though, for it was was localization, wasn't it?
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:59.500]  I mean, I would say that's what I was that's what I was thinking is that it must have been a great boon to localization, you know, that they wouldn't have to localize, you know?
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:07.500]  Yeah. Because they didn't really as I recall, they didn't really do like subtitles either. It wasn't like there was stuff that was on screen. It was just.
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:18.500]  Yeah, they wouldn't. Yeah, they're right. And I mean, everyone. So I think there was some they would have an on screen. They would at least have an on screen description of like what you might need to do.
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:28.500]  But I think sometimes they actually said like the character is saying, you know, they would have like the character's name and colon and then like dialogue.
[01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:37.500]  Maybe we should. Yeah. But so, I mean, like I just I don't I think that it's kind of cool to to get that extra material now.
[01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:41.500]  And I'm so I'm I'm now on board.
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:46.500]  That's the way they're going to do it from now on. I think. But I'd also I think that those exclusives stink, too.
[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:52.500]  You know, that if somehow Sony paid them so that PlayStation has like a two month period where only PlayStation can get.
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:58.500]  Oh, yeah. And that that's rotten. Like you shouldn't be penalized because you have the the quote.
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:04.500]  Yeah. I mean, I kind of get it if it's the I mean, like the Xbox 360, I kind of understand because you can get it on the Xbox one.
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:09.500]  And so, yeah, I mean, OK, they're not they're not going to spend as much development time on an older platform.
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:16.500]  Right. You I was like, you is the one that's the new one. Right.
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:28.500]  Maybe we should do the rest of the episode just with mumbles and grunts and see if, you know, can we do this?
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:34.500]  I'm sure that I used to care and I used to play The Sims long, long ago, and we used to talk like that to each other.
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:46.500]  And then when we get mad at each other, we would like hold a finger up over like a negative sign up over our heads.
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:52.500]  It was great for our relationship. I'm I'm sure that our our.
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:57.500]  Third and final sponsor of the show will love it if I just mumble and grunt.
[01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:06.500]  We should start after the sponsor. Our third sponsor is.
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:15.500]  It's Wealthfront, an automated investment service with over three billion dollars in client assets under management already in plain English.
[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:23.500]  They make it easy for anyone to get access to a sophisticated, sophisticated, diversified long term investment portfolio.
[01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:31.500]  This is a place where you put your money away for the long term and you don't sit there and micromanage day trading.
[01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:38.500]  You're not picking stocks. They do it. They you go through a simple poll and they see what you're you know, what type of risk you're looking at, you know.
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:47.500]  And they pick a plan that will match your taste for risk.
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:53.500]  And you can get started with just 500 bucks. That's the minimum account, 500 bucks.
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:17:00.500]  Most services like this have really, really high minimum account balances just to get started.
[01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:06.500]  Wealthfront is just 500 bucks and most of their clients start with a low amount of money.
[01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:13.500]  It's sort of like, you know, put it in, see how it works before you put, quote unquote, real money in there.
[01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:21.500]  They have all sorts of other features. If you have a large account, they do this thing called tax loss harvesting.
[01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:34.500]  And it can add, according to their tests and simulated results, tax loss harvesting could add at least one point three percent to your annual after tax return.
[01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:40.500]  And direct indexing could add at least one point seven percent to your annual after tax return.
[01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:44.500]  What do those things mean? I don't know. I'm not an accountant. They are. They're the experts.
[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:48.500]  They've got all the details on the website. You can read it. And here's the other thing.
[01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:57.500]  They've got a really low fee. It's just one quarter of one percent per year on assets above ten thousand dollars.
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:01.500]  So up to ten thousand dollars. They don't even charge you a fee over ten grand.
[01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:08.500]  They charge you one quarter of one percent. Most other services like this charge two, three percent, something like that.
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:14.500]  So they're way under in terms of the management fee. It's practically minimal.
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:28.500]  And you get if you use the URL that they gave me, the special URL, which is wealthfront.com slash the talk show, wealthfront.com, the talk show.
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:33.500]  They'll bump that up to fifteen thousand dollars. So you go up to fifteen thousand dollars completely free of charge.
[01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:42.500]  Go check them out. This is a great service for long term investing, wealthfront.com slash the talk show.
[01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:55.500]  No mumbles. I think it was it was some jokers like Matt or Cards Against Humanity.
[01:18:55.500 --> 01:19:03.500]  Those guys, they might take a moment. Yeah, Matt might do them. I could probably.
[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:07.500]  Every once in a while.
[01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:11.500]  I could actually see them requesting that.
[01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:18.500]  They make like wacky, you know, some, you know, if you've listened and they do some weird stuff and they're like,
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:23.500]  you probably won't go for this, but if you want to, you could do this. I'll go for that. It'd be great.
[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:32.500]  Anything to make these things interesting. So that's off to them. Anything else on your agenda? What else is going on this week?
[01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:37.500]  Well, I don't know. Do you want to talk about any cues? Yeah, that'd be good. And I read that.
[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:46.500]  I read the piece that you linked to, which, yeah, I mean, I completely agree. It sounds exactly exactly like what he really meant.
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:53.500]  How would you summarize this? So what's the what is that? What's the attitude there?
[01:19:53.500 --> 01:20:01.500]  It's sort of like, you know, the hell with this. So it started with any Q and interview in Variety.
[01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:13.500]  And the gist of it was that they were like asking about the Apple's long rumored, quote unquote, skinny bundle of TV channels that you could say you give Apple ten dollars a month or twenty dollars a month.
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:29.500]  And you could get like ESPN, CNN, Turner Classic Movies, you know, like, I don't know, quote unquote, skinny bundle where maybe you'd get like 30 of the most popular channels, like a basic cable kind of thing.
[01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:35.500]  Yeah, like a basic cable, maybe even smaller. And they haven't been able to pull it off.
[01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:48.500]  And one of the reasons is that all of these, almost all of these TV channels are owned by these massive conglomerates, big media corporations that always want to bundle these things all together.
[01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:54.500]  And so like, you know, they're, you know, like so when and that's what they're used to dealing with in the cable world.
[01:20:54.500 --> 01:21:06.500]  And so like the reason you have 850 channels, I mean, literally, some of the channels I watch are like up in the 800s. I don't understand why, but that's where they are.
[01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:21.500]  I watch like four channels and some of them are up in the 800s. But the reason why is that it's like if you want to have ESPN in your bundle, you've got to take, you know, ESPN2 and ESPN Spanish and ESPN3 and ESPN Headline News or whatever it's called.
[01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:29.500]  You've got to take them all. You can't just say we just want to offer ESPN and then we can pass the savings on to our customer. They're not interested in that.
[01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:39.500]  And so Eddy Cue told, and everybody has been under the impression that Apple has been trying to negotiate something like this, specifically Eddy Cue. That's, you know, right up his wheelhouse. I mean, he's the guy.
[01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:43.500]  And he told Variety that they don't even really want to do it.
[01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:47.500]  I don't even want to go to your party.
[01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:51.500]  Exactly. I'm not invited. Well, I don't want to go. Yeah, I didn't want to go to your party.
[01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:59.500]  And a friend of the show, Peter Kafka, you know, I was on his podcast recently. I don't know if you listen to it. I thought it was pretty, pretty good.
[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:02.500]  It's in my queue.
[01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:05.500]  Thanks for listening, John.
[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:12.500]  It actually is. I actually have had the had the web page open for like a long time and I just haven't gotten to it yet.
[01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:18.500]  If you have or anybody who hasn't listened, it's a good I'll put it in the show notes.
[01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:26.500]  Peter Kafka of Recode does a like an inside the media podcast.
[01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:31.500]  I think Samantha Bee was on recently. So that's kind of cool that I was on a podcast where Samantha Bee was on.
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:34.500]  Yeah, like I find you listen to that one instead.
[01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:40.500]  Oh, I would. I'm sure it's I'm sure it's a lot funnier. I guarantee that.
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:45.500]  I love her show, by the way. Do you watch her show? I've seen. Well, I you know, I get clip. I clip everything.
[01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:51.500]  I honestly I honestly would because I don't get cable. But you said to me, who's the funniest person on late night TV right now?
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:56.500]  I think I would say Samantha Bee. She's really good. I think she's really good. I like John Oliver a lot, too.
[01:22:56.500 --> 01:23:01.500]  But he would be my two of them. I think we're tied for me. Yeah. Can you I still can't.
[01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:06.500]  I can't believe they were both on the Daily Show and somehow the Comedy Central let them both get away.
[01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:12.500]  Like the two to me, the two funniest people on on TV are them. But anyway, I'll put it in the show notes.
[01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:17.500]  You can listen to it. Peter Kafka wanted to talk to me about the one man media empire I've set up here.
[01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:24.500]  So if you've ever wanted to know my thinking behind, you know, what the hell I do here at Daring Fireball, you could go this.
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:29.500]  I thought it turned out pretty good. I hate talking about myself. I hate I really do.
[01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:35.500]  And it's you know, in the gist of it is that this has been somewhat successful, which makes me hate talking about it even more.
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:41.500]  And it somehow he made it tolerable and I didn't want to die. So you can go listen to it.
[01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:48.500]  But anyway, Peter Kafka, media reporter extraordinaire, linked to this EdiQ thing with variety.
[01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:53.500]  And he offered his own translation of it, which, like you said, really is like, yeah, this is what he made.
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:24:00.500]  It rings completely true. You know, I mean, just that we we can't pull it together.
[01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:10.500]  So, you know, so heck with it. We will just say that we we don't even want to do it, although I mean, I'm sure they're still interested.
[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:16.500]  I think so, too. And I think that Kafka's take of look, we see that you guys are headed off a cliff.
[01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:21.500]  You should see it, too. You know, this seems this seems like it should be.
[01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:26.500]  I hate to say it, but win, win, win. Right. That this is good. This such a deal would be good for Apple.
[01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:37.500]  It would be good for Apple TV users. And it would be good for these TV channels because they'd have this life after cable.
[01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:44.500]  But if you guys want to wait till you go over the cliff and then we'll work it out, sort it out at the end, I guess that's what we'll do.
[01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:50.500]  Because it really for me, for me, it would obviously it would be great because we don't get cable.
[01:24:50.500 --> 01:25:03.500]  And every once in a while, that's a problem. The funny the funny thing was like when we when we first canceled cable, it was my wife called me back when I was working in an office and she called me.
[01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:12.500]  She said, I canceled cable. And I was like, oh, this was it was what would have been six years ago, something like that.
[01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:19.500]  Anyway, it was a year. It was the year of the Olympics, the Winter Olympics. I was like, I was thinking we would do it right after the Olympics.
[01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:24.500]  She was like, oh, oh, yeah. So we didn't watch the Olympics that year.
[01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:29.500]  But, you know, but we have not we have not looked back other than other than every once in a while.
[01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:33.500]  They're being like something like that, though. I think it would be really nice to watch as it airs.
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:38.500]  But, you know, it's not worth the ongoing cost to us. Yeah.
[01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:45.500]  And it just seems to me that I would think again, I'm making this up, so I'm not an analyst.
[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:53.500]  I can make stuff up. I think, though, that cord cutting is a it's a good demographic.
[01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:58.500]  Like it's not people are cutting the cord because they can't afford cable.
[01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:12.500]  It's because they're technically savvy enough that they've got devices that they can use to fill up, you know, the four hours of time they want to spend entertaining themselves on a screen without cable.
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:27.500]  Yeah. You know, and well, it's like I was spending so much time getting my media some other way, you know, time and money getting my media some other way, like either buying it off of iTunes or getting it someplace where I wouldn't have to have ads in it that I was not.
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:34.500]  I mean, I certainly wasn't. Devoting $60 a month of my entertainment.
[01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:39.500]  You know, I was spending so much more on that compared to the other stuff that it just didn't make sense anymore.
[01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:45.500]  Yeah, I just don't understand why these the TV executives wouldn't want to get a piece of that pie, you know, get involved.
[01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:51.500]  Yeah, well, like, you know, like Kafka alludes, they probably will eventually.
[01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:57.500]  Yeah. And I don't know. I just can't help but think that the app model is it's just not ideal.
[01:26:57.500 --> 01:27:04.500]  It's you know, it's not bad and it works. And there are some of those stations, you know, I call them state works if you're big, right?
[01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:10.500]  I mean, it works if you're HBO. But I don't think it works necessarily for everybody.
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:17.500]  Yeah, HBO does it pretty well. I think that their Apple TV app, I think the interface is a little confusing that the navigation.
[01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:21.500]  I don't know if you've used it, but the. Yeah, just a bit.
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:28.500]  It's it's a the there's like a simple like iOS really hammered at home.
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:34.500]  But it's like that that old next column view, you know, from the next finder or whatever the file manager.
[01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:42.500]  And now that you have it in the finder. Right. And it's such a simple little thing, but it's so brilliant where you, you know, start on the left.
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:49.500]  This is the route. And as you go deeper, it just keeps sliding over. Right. The whole iPhone interface is built on that.
[01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:54.500]  Right. So far left conceptually is here's all of your email accounts. You go into one of them.
[01:27:54.500 --> 01:28:00.500]  Here's all of the mailboxes in that account. You hit a mailbox. Here's all of the messages in that mailbox.
[01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:04.500]  Just keep going to the right. The the Apple TV is large.
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:14.500]  You know, a lot of the stuff in Apple TV is largely like that. The HBO app is just sort of like here's a whole bunch of things you can tap and it'll take you somewhere.
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:22.500]  And there's no I have no idea how to get back to where I just was. But anyway, one of my biggest one of my biggest complaints about the Apple TV is the fact that it brought.
[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:28.500]  It brought some crappy apps, I think. Yeah, like I think the Netflix app is not as good as it used to be. Yeah.
[01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:33.500]  Maybe it's the same. Maybe it's the same on the old. Maybe there's an update that came to the older ones, too, and it's not as good as well.
[01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:40.500]  But they they did a they did an update. And actually, maybe that's true because I think the iOS one is not as good as it used to be either.
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:51.500]  It seems like they did an update that was trying to get there. You know, again, going back to sort of what we were talking about earlier about Microsoft and Google, trying to get their app experience the same off of across all those platforms.
[01:28:51.500 --> 01:29:01.500]  And, you know, that experience was not nearly as good as the original iOS apps were.
[01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:09.500]  The good thing about HBO, this I salute you, HBO, you are doing it right, is that they they don't have any kind of like window.
[01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:20.500]  It's like if you want to watch Game of Thrones on Sunday night because you don't want spoilers, you can watch it on the HBO app as soon as it's on the TV station.
[01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:28.500]  Yeah. Really like that. When I used to be in, I loved it. It's probably my favorite show of all time, Mad Men.
[01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:42.500]  I always bought it on iTunes so that I could watch it without ads and without even, you know, I mean, this is me and my money just pouring through my fingers because I don't even I have TiVo, of course, but I didn't, you know, don't even like skipping ads.
[01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:53.500]  It's the show is to I thought Mad Men was so cinematic that it was just wrecking. It's like watching a movie with with commercials. I don't even want to do the blip, blip, blip.
[01:29:53.500 --> 01:30:01.500]  So I bought I would buy the season pass on iTunes, but they'd make it only come out like 24 hours later.
[01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:06.500]  And Mad Men wasn't like Game of Thrones where there were these crazy plot twists and it wasn't nearly as popular.
[01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:13.500]  You know, it was popular, but Game of Thrones isn't popular. So you didn't have to worry about Game of Thrones is the kind of thing where everybody's watching at the same time.
[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:19.500]  And, you know, it's on Twitter. You can see, you know, when it's happening because everybody's commenting on it as it's being aired.
[01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:27.500]  Right. And so I didn't it wasn't so much that I was worried about a 24 hour window where I could encounter a spoiler.
[01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:31.500]  It was just a vague frustration that I'm really looking forward to this next episode of the show.
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:39.500]  Like maybe, you know, if there was like some kind of cliffhanger the week before, it just felt annoying to me that I'm the sucker who paid money.
[01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:48.500]  Even though I've got cable where I could watch it for free, I've given you more money so that I can watch it without the commercial interruptions.
[01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:53.500]  And you're making me wait 24 hours. Like, I feel like I should get it 24 hours early, if anything.
[01:30:53.500 --> 01:31:02.500]  Yeah. And the stupid thing is the whole thing is predicated on deals that they have with cable providers.
[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:07.500]  Yeah. The other thing I will say, yes, this is true, too. I don't know how HBO got it.
[01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:10.500]  And so you're suffering because of a deal they made with somebody else.
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:19.500]  Yeah. In my defense also, I will defend my financial finagling.
[01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:21.500]  You need Wealthfront. You need Wealthfront.
[01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:26.500]  You know what? I should put all my money in there so I can stop wasting it on
[01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:29.500]  Stop spending it on TV shows that you get other ways.
[01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:34.500]  I don't know what my annual returns are on the episodes of Mad Men I own, but
[01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:42.500]  For you, it's not one, one and a half percent or whatever they said. It's more like two, three percent because they would advise you to stop spending your money on TV shows.
[01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:49.500]  I will say this. I have watched Mad Men in its entirety twice, although I didn't watch the last season, re-watch the last season yet.
[01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:53.500]  I've watched everything but the last season entirely twice.
[01:31:53.500 --> 01:32:02.500]  That wouldn't have still been on my TiVo, so I would have had to buy it somehow.
[01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:05.500]  Do you watch Kimmy Schmidt?
[01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:14.500]  Yes. I don't know if we completed season two. I don't know if we have or not, but I know we're at least halfway through season two and we did watch season one.
[01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:16.500]  Because Jon Hamm is the crazy
[01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:20.500]  Oh yeah, we did finish it. I won't say it.
[01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:25.500]  I won't say it either. There's a great joke about that.
[01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:29.500]  What was the joke about Jon Hamm? Is that a spoiler? Can you say that?
[01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:39.500]  Well, it kind of ruins the joke, but it's in reference to him being I'll say it.
[01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:43.500]  If you don't want to skip over this, if you don't want to know what the joke is
[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:44.500]  Skip 30 seconds.
[01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:53.500]  But she talks about how the guy that held her captive was so crazy and he thought that he wrote that Coke song.
[01:32:53.500 --> 01:33:02.500]  That slipped past me. I didn't notice that. Oh, I did not catch that joke.
[01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:15.500]  Yeah, because it's delivered in a very off hand. So they're just walking down the street and I think she's talking to Titus or something and his next line cuts right in.
[01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:22.500]  They don't spend any time on it at all. They just deliver it and move on.
[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:25.500]  So it's an odd segue, but I will go with it.
[01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:34.500]  One other thing. I was talking after we watched the season two of Kimmy Schmidt. So anybody who doesn't know, it's the TV show on Netflix.
[01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:37.500]  The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt or just Unbreakable?
[01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:39.500]  I think it's The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:44.500]  Created by Tina Fey. I don't know who else deserves creator credit.
[01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:48.500]  And if you liked 30 Rock, you'll like this show.
[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:57.500]  I don't see how anybody who liked 30 Rock wouldn't like this show. And it is so densely populated with jokes.
[01:33:57.500 --> 01:34:06.500]  And the thing that really struck me is that now that there's a second show in this style, it's like Tina Fey.
[01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:13.500]  I know that everybody loves her and she's super popular and does award shows and all these accolades.
[01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:32.500]  But I still feel like it's almost under remarked upon how she's invented a format for a sitcom that is an entire order of magnitude denser with jokes than anything that came before it.
[01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:48.500]  It's exquisite. I don't write screenplays, but I write. It just seems impossible to me that they come up with 10 or 20 episodes that densely packed with jokes.
[01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:55.500]  Almost every single word out of every character's mouth is a joke. There's no setup. It's just relentless.
[01:34:55.500 --> 01:35:06.500]  It's not like you're sitting there laughing the entire time nonstop. I find it incredibly engaging because it's just so smart. It's the smartest thing I've ever seen.
[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:28.500]  Yeah, and it has another layer to it, too. I think there's like things going on that you have to do. It's one of those things. I made a mistake in watching the most recent season of Arrested Development, which was trying to watch it while doing something else.
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:47.500]  I had it on in the background when I was making dinner and things like that, and I really didn't appreciate it. And so I need to go back and, I think, devote because the way that show interweaves with things going on, particularly that show where things are going on in the background that are really the funny part a lot of the times.
[01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:58.500]  It's like you see something going on that happened in a previous episode that's going on in the background right then that makes the joke in the foreground funny.
[01:35:58.500 --> 01:35:59.500]  It demands your attention.
[01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:05.500]  Yeah, and I think this is kind of like that, too, where if you're not really paying attention, you can miss a lot.
[01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:18.500]  Yeah, so that's what my recommendation is. Anybody, if you're looking for something good to watch, get into the Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Super smart. Almost impossible. And Jon Hamm is very funny on it.
[01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:21.500]  That was great casting.
[01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:39.500]  I never even mentioned the premise of the show. If you're not aware, I mean, maybe most people are aware, but the premise of the show, it's almost sick. The premise of the show is that Kimmy Schmidt, the main character, is a mole woman.
[01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:53.500]  She was kidnapped as a teenager by a weirdo and kept in an underground bunker for 20 years or something. Was it like 20 years? Ten, I think. So she missed the Bush administration or something like that.
[01:36:53.500 --> 01:37:11.500]  But she went from like 15 to 15. I can't remember. Something like that. Yeah, because it feels like it was the 90s when she was captured. Maybe it was 20. The show starts with her and the other women who were captured by this guy escaping and assimilating back into regular life.
[01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:31.500]  And they don't show the guy. They're crazy. They show him from the back for episodes and episodes, and then he finally shows up toward the end, or at least more than halfway through the first season. And it's Jon Hamm. It's great.
[01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:51.500]  I don't want to spoil too much, but there's a trial where Jon Hamm goes on trial for what he did, and it really reminded me. He represents himself as his attorney, and it so reminded me of my all-time favorite Simpson character, which was Lionel Hutz, the lawyer.
[01:37:51.500 --> 01:38:09.500]  Who was he played by? Phil Hartman. The Lionel Hutz was, to me, the funniest thing ever on The Simpsons. That's why you're the judge, and I'm the law-talking guy. You mean an attorney? Yeah!
[01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:27.500]  Oh, what else is going on? What else do we have to talk about? Are you guys submitting yourselves for Planet of the Apps? Oh, no. I don't get this at all. I really don't. I really don't. It's really strange.
[01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:45.500]  Well, first of all, I'm not a fan of reality TV, so I may not be a good person to judge this. I kind of get it in that it's a marketing tool for the App Store, I guess.
[01:38:45.500 --> 01:39:01.500]  Apple is co-producing an upcoming reality show with some production company that does regular reality shows, obviously has experience with it, where it's going to be about developers making apps.
[01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:27.500]  From what I know of reality TV, it's all this emotional soap opera stuff. I can't think of anything. This is the most... developing apps is not cinematic. It's a lot of typing.
[01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:41.500]  What are they going to show? I don't get it. I want to see Craig Hockenberry sitting at a computer. I just don't see how that's a show. I don't get it. But anyway, Apple's doing it, and they're taking applications.
[01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:53.500]  You have to be willing to live in Los Angeles for a couple of months at the end of the year. And they said, please don't sign up. Did you see this? It was like, please don't sign up if you can't do that.
[01:39:53.500 --> 01:40:03.500]  You can't commit two months to... Maybe the guy that decided he wasn't going to answer his email to go to New Zealand, he could do it.
[01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:15.500]  Well, I can see how some developers definitely could, especially young ones. And maybe that's part of the gist of the show is that it's the 20-something demographic.
[01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:29.500]  So I could see it, I guess. I don't know. It just seems very strange. The strange part to me, it doesn't seem so strange that somebody would make a show about Aptobelm, but it seems strange to me that Apple is co-producing it.
[01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:39.500]  So this is the first original content, to loop it back with the previous topic of the show. It's original content that Apple is going to give out through the iTunes store somehow.
[01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:50.500]  And it just seems very strange that it would be a reality show, when everybody else's exclusive content is stuff like Kimmy Schmidt and...
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:51.500]  Daredevil.
[01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:58.500] ...House of Cards. Yeah, Daredevil, House of Cards. It's all these cinematic...
[01:40:58.500 --> 01:40:59.500]  Really good shows.
[01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:00.500]  Really good shows.
[01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:07.500]  Really great shows that are very compelling to watch. And we're going to have some guys typing.
[01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:19.500]  T-Mobile is giving users a year of free data to play Pokemon Go. I wonder how that works, technically. How do they know what data is used for Pokemon Go?
[01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:27.500]  That's a good point. I mean, I guess there's got to be a way to identify it somehow.
[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:30.500]  Yeah, I don't know. I don't get it.
[01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:33.500]  You're not on T-Mobile, right?
[01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:38.500]  No, not really. I told you I have the...
[01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:40.500]  Oh, okay. Your Android is?
[01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:49.500]  Yeah, my Android is on a month-to-month T-Mobile plan. I think if I were going to switch, I'd probably switch to T-Mobile.
[01:41:49.500 --> 01:42:03.500]  Yeah, I would like to, but we don't have enough good coverage. I wrote a thing, gosh, it was a year ago for Tom's Hardware.
[01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:11.500]  They were doing a series of studies of who had the best coverage in certain cities, and I did the testing for them for Seattle.
[01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:19.500]  And spent a bunch of time driving around testing these different carriers on these Android phones.
[01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:29.500]  And T-Mobile was the fastest, but when I came home with the phones, we didn't get any coverage here.
[01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:33.500]  Yeah, I mean, speed is nice, but coverage is key.
[01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:41.500]  Yeah, so it wasn't really an option. I mean, really, our only option where we are right now is Verizon, because we had the same experience with AT&T.
[01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:44.500]  And we got one of those micro cells, and it didn't work for...
[01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:48.500]  Yeah, those things are garbage.
[01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:53.500]  Yeah, I have to test with this phone before I switch and see if it covers everything.
[01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:55.500]  I mean, I figure where you are, you're probably safe.
[01:42:55.500 --> 01:43:02.500]  I think it probably is, but it's such a better deal. I forget what we pay for Verizon, but it's a lot.
[01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:06.500]  All around, it's a better deal, right? I mean, you've got more flexibility, and it's cheaper.
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:13.500]  Yeah, and when they tell you it's $50 a month, you get charged $50, like $50.00, which is amazing to me.
[01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:21.500]  What? It's $50 a month, and you get three gigs, and you get your credit card notification.
[01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:26.500]  I get a notification that my credit card was charged $50.00, T-Mobile.
[01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:33.500]  I think I'm getting a better and better deal out of Verizon, I feel like, because we added Hank,
[01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:40.500]  and he does not use a small amount of data, and sometimes that's a problem, but we're still paying...
[01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:42.500]  I think we're paying less than we were a year ago.
[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:50.500]  Can I tell you what Jonas did? So, Jonas, we have 15 gigabytes of shared data among the three of us on Verizon.
[01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:55.500]  That's a lot. That's probably three times what we have.
[01:43:55.500 --> 01:44:00.500]  And it's three times more than we used most months, but it's grandfathered in.
[01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:11.500]  It's almost like the Verizon version of the old AT&T 5 unlimited, which I bet a surprising number of people are still hanging on to.
[01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:14.500]  Paul was for a long time. I think he finally got off of it.
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:22.500]  I think Casey List is, too. Somebody was talking on a podcast recently about how they're still hanging on to it,
[01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:25.500]  which drives me. I can't believe anybody does it because you can't tether.
[01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:30.500]  I don't care how much you love it, the unlimited data plan that you have on AT&T,
[01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:32.500]  but tethering is so important to me, it's ridiculous.
[01:44:32.500 --> 01:44:33.500]  Yeah, me too.
[01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:38.500]  I told you, I'm literally tethered to my Verizon phone right now as we speak.
[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:41.500]  That's how we're recording this show.
[01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:46.500]  It is so essential to my mobile computing. It's ridiculous.
[01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:51.500]  But anyway, we're grandfathered in at a better rate than you can get now for 15 gigs,
[01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:56.500]  and Amy and I flew out to California for WWDC.
[01:44:56.500 --> 01:45:02.500]  Jonas had just gotten out of school the Friday before was his last day of school, and he was with Amy's sister for the week.
[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:18.500]  And on the Monday of WWDC, I got a notice from Verizon that we've used up 14.9 gigabytes of our 15-gigabyte plan.
[01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:25.500]  And our billing cycle ends on the 12th, meaning it ends on the 12th of July, a month later.
[01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:29.500]  So it was literally the first day of the billing cycle.
[01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:39.500]  Jonas used 15 gigabytes of data in 48 hours.
[01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:41.500]  I didn't know what to say.
[01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:45.500]  And I realized in the old days, I feel like maybe it was a test.
[01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:53.500]  At first, there was a moment where I was furious. I was furiously angry.
[01:45:53.500 --> 01:46:01.500]  Because he's a smart kid. He knows what Wi-Fi is, or at least he's smart enough to know what Wi-Fi is.
[01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:06.500]  He just never got on their Wi-Fi when he got there.
[01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:14.500]  Just watched nonstop, high-definition YouTube for 48 hours.
[01:46:14.500 --> 01:46:17.500]  Man, that's a lot, though. Even with...
[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:19.500]  It's crazy.
[01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:21.500]  Even watching that, I mean, 15...
[01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:26.500]  Well, then I kind of got proud. I was like, well, that's actually kind of...
[01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:31.500]  My kid used 15 gigs of data in 48 hours.
[01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:33.500]  That's like the equivalent for...
[01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:34.500]  But in the baby book.
[01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:38.500]  Jonas isn't very good at sports, but it hit for the cycle.
[01:46:38.500 --> 01:46:40.500]  He's very good at using data.
[01:46:40.500 --> 01:46:42.500]  Very good at using data.
[01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:46.500]  I figured out that... And they were going to charge me... I forget what it is.
[01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:49.500]  But once you go over, you have to pay for every gigabyte.
[01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:51.500]  And I knew it was going to be a fairly...
[01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:54.500]  The whole WWDC week was ahead of me.
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:58.500]  The week where we were at Disney World was in there.
[01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:01.500]  I was like, this is going to be a nightmare.
[01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:05.500]  He did this on the day of the month, starting on the billing cycle.
[01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:08.500]  This is the time we actually used the 15 gigs.
[01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:13.500]  I remember it was at Disney World, the one year where I upped our plan to the 15 gig plan.
[01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:17.500]  But I checked and upgrading...
[01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:19.500]  You can temporarily upgrade to a higher plan.
[01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:21.500]  Verizon is nice about that.
[01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:24.500]  So you can go to 20 or 25 or something like that.
[01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:30.500]  But once you do, I couldn't ever go back down to this 15 gig plan we had because it no longer exists.
[01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:39.500]  And I figured that it would be better to just pay an extra $150 this month for all of our overage.
[01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:45.500]  But we really would make up for it in the long run as long as we stay in Verizon.
[01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:48.500]  And of course now here I am talking about switching to T-Mobile.
[01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:51.500]  Yeah, right.
[01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:54.500]  Well, you need to get your money out of it first.
[01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:57.500]  I did not yell at Jonas.
[01:47:57.500 --> 01:47:59.500]  I feel like this is where I'm a good parent.
[01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:04.500]  By the time I conversed with him about the situation, I was calm.
[01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:08.500]  And I was in a similar tone that I am now.
[01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:10.500]  I mean, what are you going to do?
[01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:15.500]  But I just remember when I was a kid, if I had done something like that,
[01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:23.500]  that had resulted in our family having to pay $150 for something that I could have done for free
[01:48:23.500 --> 01:48:31.500]  just by turning on Wi-Fi and logging on to his aunt's house Wi-Fi,
[01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:36.500]  my parents might have had a stroke.
[01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:41.500]  I can just imagine my dad would be so mad. Oh my God.
[01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:44.500]  It's ludicrous how easy it is.
[01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:50.500]  I'm not trying to blame Apple or anybody else really, but it's just technology
[01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:53.500]  and giving them access to this stuff.
[01:48:53.500 --> 01:48:57.500]  Because when Hank was a little kid, he spent 
[01:48:57.500 --> 01:49:02.500]  I mean, he did some in-app purchase thing where he got coins for paper toss or something.
[01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:07.500]  It was some ridiculous game and spent like $150.
[01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:08.500]  I remember that.
[01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:10.500]  Yeah, I think I told you that.
[01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:13.500]  Oh, and then like 
[01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:16.500]  Did you call about that one? Did you pay it or did you call Apple and 
[01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:19.500]  I think that one I got back. I think they refunded that.
[01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:22.500]  They refunded most of it or something. I can't remember.
[01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:31.500]  I think what I decided was that some of it should be on me because I wasn't doing the password logout thing.
[01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:36.500]  I gave him his iPad. I bought the thing for him because he wanted like 
[01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:39.500]  it was like $10 of coins or something. That's fine.
[01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:44.500]  So I got him some coins and then he was like, oh, hey, I'm still logged in.
[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:46.500]  Click, click, click, click, click.
[01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:52.500]  And I think what I did was I decided some of it I would split.
[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:58.500]  Part of it was on me, so I paid for half of it and they refunded me the other half or something like that.
[01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:06.500]  And then the other thing that happened last year was that  just last year, I think it was 
[01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:14.500]  he wanted a book, a Kindle book, and so I got onto his laptop.
[01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:22.500]  This was a terrible mistake. I got onto his laptop and got onto Amazon and bought him the Kindle so that he could get it onto his iPad.
[01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:26.500]  And then my credit card information was left in there.
[01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:31.500]  And so he was still logged into Amazon. He was just like  I don't think he knew exactly what had happened.
[01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:36.500]  He probably did, but he put a couple of things in the cart and bought them.
[01:50:36.500 --> 01:50:37.500]  I love him.
[01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:43.500]  No, no. These are going back.
[01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:47.500]  I admire him for that.
[01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:55.500]  I mean, unfortunately, that one was like  so now the thing is if we go over  I figure like five gigabytes.
[01:50:55.500 --> 01:51:01.500]  We mostly spend our time in the house, particularly in the summer where we have access to Wi-Fi.
[01:51:01.500 --> 01:51:05.500]  And I think our plan is like five gigs.
[01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:09.500]  And I'm like, if we go over and you're using most of it, you're paying for the overage.
[01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:12.500]  That's our deal. So it comes out of his allowance fee.
[01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:15.500]  Jonas has 
[01:51:15.500 --> 01:51:16.500]  Too much.
[01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:21.500]  He has  just like the parenting episode of the show, he has a surprising amount of cash.
[01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:29.500]  And it's all accumulated from like birthdays and Christmas and stuff like that.
[01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:30.500]  Yeah.
[01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:35.500]  I mean, he literally looks like he's going to Atlantic City to gamble.
[01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:42.500]  He's got like a wad of cash in a roll with like a rubber band around it.
[01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:47.500]  Because it's like we do make him  like if he wants to do like an in-app purchase or something,
[01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:55.500]  if he wants to get like a $10 upgrade for a PlayStation game or whatever, it's like, okay, I'll okay it.
[01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:57.500]  But you got to give me 10 bucks.
[01:51:57.500 --> 01:52:00.500]  And it's like when he takes out the  it's like I never had money like that.
[01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:02.500]  I remember when I was like 12 years old.
[01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:07.500]  The most money I ever had at a time was like enough to buy like a Hot Wheels car.
[01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:08.500]  Yeah.
[01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:11.500]  And they used to be about two bucks.
[01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:15.500]  Like buying a Hot Wheels car at Kmart would like bankrupt me.
[01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:20.500]  Yeah. I mean, I feel like maybe I would scrape together 15 bucks or something like that, but for the most part, yeah.
[01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:25.500]  And Hank is similar though because  and it comes in fits and spurts and I think it usually is like 
[01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:28.500]  he's usually very flush because his birthday is near Christmas.
[01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:31.500]  So he's usually very flush come January.
[01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:36.500]  But he has also spent like a  I mean, sometimes he just won't buy anything for great stretches of time.
[01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:44.500]  And then he'll build up like  I mean, there have been a number of times where he's had like a $100 bill just lying around in his room for months.
[01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:46.500]  Right. How does it happen?
[01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:49.500]  I know. I never have a $100 bill.
[01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:56.500]  We squandered our youth going out playing sandlot baseball. We should have been in the house collecting $100 bills.
[01:52:56.500 --> 01:53:01.500]  I did not make him pay the overage. It clearly was a mistake and it was a lot of money.
[01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:02.500]  Yeah.
[01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:03.500]  But if it happens again 
[01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:10.500]  Well, that's the thing. Yeah. I mean, the first one's fine, but after that  and he had already gone over once.
[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:12.500]  So this wasn't the first time.
[01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:14.500]  That's our new deal.
[01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:17.500]  We've had this discussion before. I was like, we're not having this discussion again.
[01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:29.500]  You have got to realize that you don't watch  you don't go into one of your YouTube fever dreams.
[01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:33.500]  What does he watch? Does he watch people playing games?
[01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:39.500]  I think it's mostly people playing games. Whenever I look at a screen, it's always like people playing games.
[01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:43.500]  Yeah. Yeah. Hank has gotten into  like, we went to an arcade.
[01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:48.500]  He loves going to these arcades and playing these coin games, which I can't stand mostly.
[01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:52.500]  But he watches people play these things on YouTube.
[01:53:52.500 --> 01:54:02.500]  And so we went yesterday to one of these goofy arcades, most of the games of which I can't bear.
[01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:09.500]  But there was this one game where you just drop these balls into this thing that's going around that has these holes.
[01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:13.500]  And the balls go into the holes, and whatever number you get, you get.
[01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:18.500]  And then they give you these tickets, right? And you go and exchange the tickets for some crap.
[01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:25.500]  But he had been watching  he had apparently been watching somebody who figured out the best way to play this game on YouTube.
[01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:29.500]  And he was like  it was one of those things where the tickets were just pouring out of the machine.
[01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:33.500]  And Hank was able to replicate it?
[01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:34.500]  Yeah.
[01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:35.500]  Oh my god.
[01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:45.500]  And apparently it was the kind of thing where instead of putting your coins in one coin and then letting the game play out and then putting another coin in,
[01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:48.500]  you just shove five coins in in succession.
[01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:55.500]  And because I guess the way the balls  you'll get a ball in a good hole
[01:54:55.500 --> 01:55:01.500]  because if there are a number of balls in play at any given time, your chances of getting into a good hole are better
[01:55:01.500 --> 01:55:03.500]  because they're all going to go into separate holes.
[01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:09.500]  Whereas if you drop one ball, you could get a crappy hole every single time.
[01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:16.500]  But if you drop like ten balls, one of them is probably going to go into one that's a really high number.
[01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:19.500]  And then you can take the tickets up and get candy or toys or something?
[01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:26.500]  Yeah, yeah. And then you get  this place is not just  their gifts were pretty lousy.
[01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:28.500]  Arcades aren't what they used to be, John.
[01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:30.500]  No, they're not what they used to be.
[01:55:30.500 --> 01:55:33.500]  We didn't get prizes at all when we went to an arcade.
[01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:39.500]  But there's a place at the beach where  this place that we go to at the beach has a great arcade.
[01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:43.500]  And the prizes are pretty good, but this place was pretty crappy.
[01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:46.500]  So he ended up with a whole bunch of tootsie rolls.
[01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:49.500]  He ended up with a laser pointer and a bunch of tootsie rolls.
[01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:55.500]  Yeah, Jonas had a party  he was at a birthday party at a place like that sometime in the last few months.
[01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:59.500]  And when we picked him up, everybody was just cashing in their tickets for candy.
[01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:02.500]  Nobody was looking at the toys. It's all candy.
[01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:06.500]  Yeah, that's what  I mean, he wanted to get nothing but candy, but I was like, nah, you should get something.
[01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:10.500]  Get something else. Don't just have candy. You're lying around the house. You'll be bouncing off the walls.
[01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:14.500]  Yeah. Anything else?
[01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:18.500]  I don't know. Did you want to circle back to that Samsung laptop?
[01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:20.500]  Oh, yeah, I guess we could do that and wrap up.
[01:56:20.500 --> 01:56:23.500]  We didn't. We alluded to it earlier, but didn't 
[01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:25.500]  Yeah, that's actually a good topic.
[01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:32.500]  I linked to a review  I forget where it was. Where was it?
[01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:33.500]  Gizmodo, I believe.
[01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:40.500]  Gizmodo reviews the Samsung Notebook 7 Spin. Alex Kranz was the reviewer.
[01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:50.500]  And it was so presumptuous. He said, Apple, take note. This is what people are actually looking for in a laptop under $1,000.
[01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:58.500]  It looks like a fine Windows laptop, but it looks to me a lot like a three- or four-year-old MacBook Pro, where they were thicker.
[01:56:58.500 --> 01:56:59.500]  Well, it's huge.
[01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:00.500]  It's very huge.
[01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:01.500]  It's one thing.
[01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:09.500]  And it's one of those things where it's like I don't know  sometimes I don't know when to stop. It's a short link piece, and I was doing it from my phone.
[01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:18.500]  But I felt like this was one of those ones where I could take it apart, do the old-school thing where I quote as much of it as I want, and just make fun of each thing.
[01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:22.500]  Because it's like he goes on and on at the beginning and the end about how great this machine is.
[01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:24.500]  I think it's a she.
[01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:27.500]  Oh, I don't know. I didn't even think about that.
[01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:29.500]  I think it is.
[01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:35.500]  I could be. Hope I didn't use any. I didn't use any pronouns, so I didn't really talk about Alex.
[01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:40.500]  So he or she. I'll say she. But at one point it comes up that the thing 
[01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:42.500]  She uses her in her 
[01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:54.500]  Okay. So my apologies to Alex Kranz. Five pounds? It's so heavy. And she even talks about how it's kind of heavy and clunky.
[01:57:54.500 --> 01:58:08.500]  And it has a keypad, right? It has the number keypad. Because the thing is so big, the keyboard is actually a full desktop-sized keyboard.
[01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:14.500]  That would bother me. One reason that would bother me. I don't really need the keypad. I don't do a lot of spreadsheet work.
[01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:20.500]  But I wouldn't mind having arrows over there. But it would bother me to have my hands off-center.
[01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:26.500]  Yeah. And that's the thing that I've noticed. Hank has a  he's got a Lenovo, which I can't stand.
[01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:34.500]  And it is a perfect example of how lousy plastic laptops are. Because he's rough on everything.
[01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:43.500]  But he, just by opening and closing the lid a lot, broke the hinge on the screen.
[01:58:43.500 --> 01:58:57.500]  And so, fortunately, they actually fixed it for free, which was nice. But now he's hot on  he wants a laptop that's all metal.
[01:58:57.500 --> 01:59:01.500]  Which is really  if you want a Windows laptop, that is not easy to do.
[01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:05.500]  Yeah. They have a lot of ones that look like metal, but they're actually the 
[01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:16.500]  So this thing is five pounds. So it's half a pound heavier than the 15-inch MacBook Pro, and is made of plastic.
[01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:24.500]  Yeah. I wrote  here's what I wrote. Any laptop thick enough for an Ethernet port is too thick.
[01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:31.500]  And a lot of readers push back. Because, you know, it's me being a little confrontation. But, you know, just being short and sweet.
[01:59:31.500 --> 01:59:35.500]  But what I mean by that  I understand the whole idea that there are people who would be  you know, there are a lot of readers.
[01:59:35.500 --> 01:59:40.500]  I got a lot of email from people saying, well, I would gladly take a thicker laptop that got better battery life.
[01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:43.500]  I don't carry it that much. It doesn't bother me. I've got so much other crap in my bag.
[01:59:43.500 --> 01:59:49.500]  You know, an extra half a pound or a pound isn't that big a difference. I don't get Apple's obsession with thinness.
[01:59:49.500 --> 01:59:54.500]  You know, what are they going to do? Keep making them  going until the MacBook is as thin as an iPad?
[01:59:54.500 --> 02:00:03.500]  Actually, I think, yeah, that is Apple's goal. Like, I'm writing sort of from Apple's perspective here, saying that any laptop thick enough for an Ethernet port is too thick.
[02:00:03.500 --> 02:00:10.500]  It's certainly  I'm not trying to say that that's a universal truism and that there's nobody who wouldn't actually prefer a thicker laptop that got better battery life.
[02:00:10.500 --> 02:00:19.500]  I'm saying  because that's, to me, the gist of the review from Gizmodo was the presumptuousness of trying to say that the angle that got me 
[02:00:19.500 --> 02:00:25.500]  I wouldn't have even noted the review if it wasn't written from the perspective of Samsung has made the laptop Apple should be making,
[02:00:25.500 --> 02:00:34.500]  which I think is almost literally what she wrote, where it's like this is somebody who has no idea what Apple's design philosophy and goals are.
[02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:40.500]  Like, they do not want to make a thicker MacBook.
[02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:43.500]  Yeah. It's just it's a market that they're not in.
[02:00:43.500 --> 02:00:44.500]  Right.
[02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:46.500]  I mean, it's a cheap, you know 
[02:00:46.500 --> 02:00:47.500]  It's the same thing 
[02:00:47.500 --> 02:00:50.500]  Maybe it's good for that class, but it's not a class that they make.
[02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:57.500]  It's the same thing with the phones. I mean, like, I know that there are plenty of people listening to me talk right now
[02:00:57.500 --> 02:01:08.500]  who would be happy to buy a new iPhone that was, you know, significant, like maybe as thick as the original iPhone,
[02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:14.500]  and just have all that extra space to go to the battery and just have that battery right there, you know, a thicker battery.
[02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:20.500]  You know, not a preposterously thick phone. Just go back to the thickness of, like, the 3GS or something like that.
[02:01:20.500 --> 02:01:21.500]  Or even 
[02:01:21.500 --> 02:01:25.500]  Well, I mean, we both have an iPhone SE, right?
[02:01:25.500 --> 02:01:29.500]  I don't use it as my daily phone anymore. I never bought one.
[02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:30.500]  Oh, okay.
[02:01:30.500 --> 02:01:33.500]  And I don't, you know, I don't want to use a review phone as a personal device.
[02:01:33.500 --> 02:01:39.500]  So I didn't buy one  we could go into it if you want, but I'm torn, terribly torn.
[02:01:39.500 --> 02:01:43.500]  I've seen other people say, when I bring this up before, that they'll say,
[02:01:43.500 --> 02:01:50.500]  I would even go back to the thickness of the iPhone 4, just anything to put a little bit more battery in there because it just seems 
[02:01:50.500 --> 02:01:55.500]  I also think it's maybe  it's subjective, but that it's just your perception.
[02:01:55.500 --> 02:02:00.500]  But so many people seem to think that they just need, you know, like 20% more, you know,
[02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:04.500]  that it's just like the last, like, two or three hours of the day is when the phone dies.
[02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:10.500]  And I know that there are people who would buy it, but Apple's not going to muddle their product line by having thicker phones and thinner phones,
[02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:15.500]  just so the battery's built in, and it's just the way that it is.
[02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:25.500]  And I think that  I don't think Apple's doing it without some market research that they know that in the store, people tend to buy the thinner phone.
[02:02:25.500 --> 02:02:34.500]  Yeah. Well, I  and I said this before, but I  back before the  what, before the 6, I guess,
[02:02:34.500 --> 02:02:41.500]  one of the things that  the only other thing that I was ever really envious about certain Android phones was how thin they were.
[02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:51.500]  But I  that said, I'm using an iPhone SE now, and I'm glad to have it be  the battery lasts a little bit longer.
[02:02:51.500 --> 02:02:52.500]  It does. It definitely does.
[02:02:52.500 --> 02:02:58.500]  I'm mostly  but I'm mostly glad that it's a smaller phone. I mean, I'm mostly  for me, it's all about getting back to a smaller size.
[02:02:58.500 --> 02:03:02.500]  Yeah. Do you want to hear me explain why I didn't buy an iPhone SE?
[02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:03.500]  Sure. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:03:03.500 --> 02:03:13.500]  I love the size in the hand. I find  I found, though, that with my particular vision problems right now, it's  the size of text, like 
[02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:22.500]  and it's not even with the retina. The retina  the bad eye  my bad left eye with the  that had the retina damage and just even leaving it aside,
[02:03:22.500 --> 02:03:27.500]  even in my right eye, which is perfectly healthy, when I'm wearing my contact lenses,
[02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:33.500]  I really have trouble focusing at anything less than an arm's distance away, unless I have really bright light.
[02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:43.500]  And if I wear glasses, I can take off my glasses, and I still  because I'm so badly nearsighted, I can see up close real near.
[02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:50.500]  So I could use the iPhone SE, but it really helps me. I love it. I mean, and I write about accessibility all the time, but 
[02:03:50.500 --> 02:03:56.500]  and my vision problems are almost nothing. I shouldn't even complain about them compared to people who are, like, actually blind.
[02:03:56.500 --> 02:04:01.500]  I mean, I know  I have friends who have truly, truly terrible vision, you know,
[02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:06.500]  and turn on the ridiculously large accessibility sizes for text in iOS.
[02:04:06.500 --> 02:04:12.500]  And the  you know, I have my  but the way that you can resize text in iOS, I have it, like, two clicks up,
[02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:16.500]  and it really makes a difference when I'm wearing my contact lenses. I really appreciate it.
[02:04:16.500 --> 02:04:21.500]  It's  I can read so much easier and in darker situations than I could otherwise.
[02:04:21.500 --> 02:04:30.500]  And on the  I found that on the iPhone SE, if I made text big enough for me to see with my contacts in, it's just a little too cramped.
[02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:37.500]  Like, so if I had the same vision I had even just five years ago, really, I mean, I've really 
[02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:42.500]  it's just  I've just hit the point where the presbyopia, you know, the  you probably know,
[02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:49.500]  but the presbyopia is where, when you get older, when you start needing reading glasses and you have difficulty focusing at closer distances.
[02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:54.500]  It's really hit me in the last five years. If I had the vision I had five years ago, I'd have the iPhone SE, without question.
[02:04:54.500 --> 02:04:57.500]  It's really  to me, it's an accessibility thing with the text.
[02:04:57.500 --> 02:05:02.500]  And combine that with the fact that I know I'm probably going to buy an iPhone, whatever they call it, this September,
[02:05:02.500 --> 02:05:06.500]  why buy an iPhone SE just to use for five months?
[02:05:06.500 --> 02:05:16.500]  Yeah, well, I'm into it now, so  and Karen and Hank are both on the  that plan, the Apple plan,
[02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:19.500]  so they're the ones who are going to get the new phone in the fall, and I'm not.
[02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:24.500]  I mean, otherwise, if it wasn't for my eyes, bottom line, I would love the SE. I really would.
[02:05:24.500 --> 02:05:25.500]  Yeah.
[02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:31.500]  It's probably good that we brought that up, because I know  I think my review was such a rave about it that it kind of left it up in the air.
[02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:36.500]  And, like, at WWDC, a couple people saw me using my iPhone 6S and were surprised that I didn't have an SE.
[02:05:36.500 --> 02:05:47.500]  Yeah, but I understand. I mean, I understand that. My mom has a  she had a 3GS for years, and then finally got  I think she got the 
[02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:52.500]  gosh, did she get the 6S or the 6? I think she got the 6 when it came out.
[02:05:52.500 --> 02:06:07.500]  And she doesn't have any battery problem with it, because every time she's done with it, she shuts it down.
