[00:00.000 --> 00:05.720]  Hey, so what's the situation? So as we record and and we're gonna do I'm gonna do my best to get this show out tonight
[00:06.000 --> 00:08.000]  this is Thursday the
[00:08.560 --> 00:13.500]  26th so that people can listen while they're they're staying up late for pre-orders
[00:14.640 --> 00:19.600]  But let me let me double check with you because I feel like you've got a better sense of these things
[00:19.600 --> 00:30.760]  I am correct that tonight at 3 in the morning on the East Coast is when I've iPhone 10 goes on sale. Yeah, absolutely
[00:30.840 --> 00:36.760]  Because they say Friday and you think oh Friday at midnight, okay, there you go, but it's but they really mean is
[00:39.080 --> 00:44.840]  Friday at 1201, you know, like technically Friday, but literally 12 a.m. Pacific Coast time
[00:44.840 --> 00:52.480]  So I haven't been in this boat I don't even remember the last time I was in this boat
[00:52.480 --> 00:58.180]  I don't know why I don't remember when I ordered my iPhone 7s last year
[00:58.760 --> 01:02.360]  I don't think I stayed up till 3 in the morning to do it though
[01:02.360 --> 01:06.880]  I don't know why and then in years prior I was at the
[01:07.720 --> 01:10.020]  XOXO conference in Portland
[01:10.020 --> 01:17.320]  Which is on the west coast and up, you know, like socializing with friends and we'd all like as a group
[01:17.320 --> 01:23.200]  It was a whole bunch of nerds and we'd all like have our timer set and at 1155
[01:23.600 --> 01:26.060]  everybody would put their drinks down and fire up the
[01:28.020 --> 01:31.940]  Apple store on their phones and get ready to order everybody was ordering phones together
[01:32.560 --> 01:34.560]  So now I've got to stay up till 3 in the morning
[01:35.160 --> 01:38.220]  To do this. Is that is that the same situation in Canada?
[01:38.220 --> 01:41.000]  Yeah, I thought you said stay up and not wake up as well
[01:41.360 --> 01:45.680]  Cuz oh, this is no question for me because the Internet is full of all you know
[01:45.680 --> 01:51.120]  All our friends putting up the pictures of their nine or ten alarms. They've set for every minute before midnight or 3 a.m
[01:52.760 --> 01:56.720]  If I guess there's no chance that I if I went to sleep before 3 a.m
[01:56.720 --> 01:59.740]  There is no chance that I any alarm would wake me up
[02:00.420 --> 02:01.080]  No way
[02:01.080 --> 02:03.980]  I've tried the because you go there at midnight or you go there at 3 a.m
[02:04.280 --> 02:07.580]  And you think that it's gonna be up and it's often delayed by several minutes
[02:07.580 --> 02:10.760]  I think one time it was 15 or 20 minutes before it actually started working
[02:11.760 --> 02:19.720]  Yeah, it's and I think this one is gonna be the shit show to end all shit shows personally because I feel like
[02:21.680 --> 02:22.480]  Every you know
[02:22.480 --> 02:26.560]  There's more excitement about the iPhone 10 than any iPhone in recent years
[02:26.760 --> 02:33.240]  Probably at least since the iPhone the 6 and 6 plus when they first went to a bigger size and there was pent-up demand
[02:33.240 --> 02:40.080]  But even then I feel like a lot of that pent-up demand for the iPhone 6 and the 6 plus
[02:40.840 --> 02:42.280]  was
[02:42.280 --> 02:49.540]  Not really in from the enthusiast crowd, but was truly from the mass market that you know
[02:49.680 --> 02:55.740]  That that just regular people were like I I want a bigger phone. I heard Apple's coming out with a bigger phone
[02:55.880 --> 03:02.280]  So I'm gonna wait and it wasn't really a buy it the first day at 12 midnight Pacific
[03:02.280 --> 03:04.320]  It was just sort of buy it in
[03:05.360 --> 03:10.220]  October November December when it first whenever their contract recycled or was convenient, right?
[03:11.580 --> 03:13.580]  Yeah, absolutely
[03:14.400 --> 03:19.520]  Yeah, whereas this one it feels like it just feels like everybody who follows me on Twitter is buying one tonight
[03:20.160 --> 03:23.880]  And it's also interesting because it's like the return of the lineup because for years
[03:24.600 --> 03:26.880]  Marketing has been at war with utter war but you know
[03:26.880 --> 03:30.040]  They've had this thing with with retail where the lineups get a lot of attention
[03:30.040 --> 03:35.280]  But it's a bad customer experience and since Angela Erin's arrived. She's been doing everything possible to
[03:36.160 --> 03:40.320]  Reduce the lineups or eliminate the lineups and it also solves scalping and a bunch of other issues
[03:40.440 --> 03:45.200]  But now people are legitimately gonna line up and super early again because on the off chance
[03:45.200 --> 03:48.000]  They can't or just won't or don't manage to order successfully
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.440]  They want to be there right when the Apple Store opens to grab whatever stock they can I think that's nuts
[03:53.440 --> 03:57.420]  I was it was so funny because I was talking to somebody
[03:57.420 --> 04:02.380]  It just either yesterday or the day before. I think it was yesterday. I
[04:02.780 --> 04:07.420]  was chatting with somebody and they were like they they're not even gonna do the store thing right because
[04:07.820 --> 04:09.740]  Quantities are gonna be so low and I was like, you know
[04:09.740 --> 04:15.700]  I don't know and and I was gonna ping somebody at Apple just to ask like hey
[04:15.700 --> 04:23.260]  What's the plan and I realized that they just like while I was chatting with my friend posted to their newsroom blog
[04:23.260 --> 04:27.100]  Here's what here's the deal and they are in fact going to
[04:27.820 --> 04:29.820]  have
[04:31.860 --> 04:34.560]  Probably like one iPhone 10 per retail store
[04:35.060 --> 04:42.740]  It's that they're doing I think it's 55 countries because if the suppliers were really or are is really as constrained as we all heard
[04:42.740 --> 04:50.020]  That they are doing things like I forget was like Andaloria or something in 55 other Guernsey like is Guernsey getting one iPhone. I
[04:50.020 --> 04:54.260]  I never even heard of that country. Honestly, I honestly
[04:55.620 --> 05:00.900]  Might be slaughtering. I don't know. Oh, yeah at one point in 10th grade we had to
[05:03.060 --> 05:04.380]  We had a
[05:04.380 --> 05:07.260]  history class where we learned about all the countries in the world and one of the
[05:07.300 --> 05:12.180]  Exams was we got a blank map of the world and we had to fill in every country in the world
[05:12.220 --> 05:17.880]  So at one point I knew every country in the world, but I feel like in the inner in the interceding
[05:17.880 --> 05:23.780]  In 25 years. I feel like there's like a bunch of countries like rebranded or something. I did
[05:26.540 --> 05:31.740]  Ireland Isle of Man Monaco Mexico Russians and Netherlands Slovenia Slovakia, Spain
[05:33.300 --> 05:39.540]  Andorra Australia, it's just there's so many countries for a phone that we think is gonna be in such Latvia Kuwait
[05:40.180 --> 05:43.500]  Liechtenstein Lithuania Luxembourg, you know Malta, I mean
[05:44.540 --> 05:46.740]  It doesn't it's like you said it doesn't really
[05:46.740 --> 05:49.380]  it doesn't jibe with the
[05:50.420 --> 05:52.420]  rampant rumors that
[05:52.980 --> 05:56.940]  that supply is going to be extremely constrained and you don't even have to
[05:57.540 --> 06:05.300]  Have your own sources in the supply chain to speculate that supplies are going to be constrained because obviously the phone is late
[06:05.300 --> 06:07.300]  I mean ideally if everything had gone
[06:07.680 --> 06:09.500]  according to
[06:09.500 --> 06:12.740]  Apple's wishes they would have it would have shipped, you know
[06:12.740 --> 06:16.660]  Alongside the iPhone 8 a month ago, right and they're not doing it
[06:16.660 --> 06:22.260]  The way they have certain launches like Apple watch or iPad where they come they lock it down to maybe four or five countries
[06:22.260 --> 06:27.460]  Like maybe the US the UK Australia China, you know one or two others. They it's a typical launch for them
[06:27.980 --> 06:33.820]  Yeah, so I don't know how to square those two things like it's you know
[06:34.620 --> 06:38.660]  Is it really gonna be just a token launch where it?
[06:38.660 --> 06:43.100]  I don't know. I I this is one of those things where I just do not know what to expect
[06:43.180 --> 06:51.460]  I totally think that it if I had to bet I would bet that if you get bad luck tonight in the
[06:52.020 --> 06:54.020]  reload apple.com
[06:54.940 --> 06:59.500]  Or store dot apple.com website and you you
[07:00.140 --> 07:02.140]  reload at the wrong minute and
[07:02.500 --> 07:07.660]  Maybe something hiccups and your thing doesn't go through and then you reload again and all of a sudden
[07:07.660 --> 07:09.660]  It's two minutes after midnight
[07:09.940 --> 07:11.940]  You're looking at four to six weeks
[07:12.460 --> 07:13.580]  It's four to six weeks
[07:13.580 --> 07:17.540]  And you go back and try to think of white might be sooner and whites actually later right back to blackness even later
[07:18.020 --> 07:21.940]  Yeah, yeah exactly that that you you know, you better get this stuff queued up
[07:21.940 --> 07:27.780]  Yeah, and and if you get bad luck it but who knows maybe not maybe you know, maybe Apple will surprise us and
[07:28.460 --> 07:34.060]  there will be I don't know enough millions on day one to
[07:34.060 --> 07:36.060]  I
[07:36.220 --> 07:43.500]  Mean I'm sure no matter what by the morning by Friday morning, it's gonna be backordered by weeks. I mean that seems inevitable
[07:44.620 --> 07:50.900]  But maybe they'll have enough millions that you know that it really, you know will be a legitimate 55 country launch
[07:50.900 --> 07:53.220]  Yeah, I mean it's gonna be interesting to see I
[07:57.020 --> 07:59.020]  Don't know I don't know what to do
[07:59.020 --> 08:04.900]  Your plan a lot of coffee and I'll stay I've done this before I think one time we were at an event and actually had
[08:04.900 --> 08:08.520]  To do it either the night after or the right after the event while I was while I was in an uber
[08:09.260 --> 08:12.840]  Trying to get back to back to the hotel and it's always stressful
[08:12.840 --> 08:17.520]  But I just get up I make sure I favorite it in advance in the Apple Store app
[08:17.520 --> 08:19.620]  So that it's right ready to go when I load up the app
[08:20.100 --> 08:21.900]  And then I refresh it
[08:21.900 --> 08:26.220]  I force quit it if I have to if it's not loading and then I keep trying until it loads and I just get my
[08:26.220 --> 08:27.820]  Order in as soon as I can
[08:27.820 --> 08:34.380]  Generally, I've been lucky that I don't know if it's if it's voodoo if it's just
[08:35.260 --> 08:36.820]  you know a
[08:36.820 --> 08:43.980]  Too small of a data set, you know that it's just my own personal experience. I personally find that the iOS app
[08:44.500 --> 08:48.600]  The Apple Store app on iOS is seems like the way to go
[08:48.600 --> 08:54.460]  yeah, and like you said like get it in there favorite it so that you can refresh it right at 1201 and
[08:54.460 --> 09:01.060]  And get through I find that it works better than the website now. I can I prove that you know
[09:01.060 --> 09:03.060]  I don't know and in general
[09:03.900 --> 09:06.380]  For you know for most things
[09:06.380 --> 09:10.680]  I find that going on a on a Mac in a browser to the
[09:11.220 --> 09:17.420]  Website is a more reliable way to get something done quickly, you know that I can type faster and stuff like that
[09:17.620 --> 09:20.620]  But since everything is already stored in it the app
[09:20.620 --> 09:26.060]  It kind of is just sort of a tap tap tap and you're not really it's not like you have to type out your credit
[09:26.060 --> 09:27.700]  Card or whatever you can just use Apple pay
[09:27.700 --> 09:31.380]  Yeah, so it's it can go pretty quickly and I was like in the u.s.
[09:31.380 --> 09:34.420]  But here there's on most credit cards is $100 limit on Apple pay
[09:34.420 --> 09:38.700]  So I set up an American Express just for Apple for Apple pay and there's no limit on that. I
[09:39.220 --> 09:42.100]  Know we don't have a limit. Okay, I just bought
[09:42.100 --> 09:48.700]  Well, I don't know maybe there is a limit but I know it's not a hundred dollars because I just bought a
[09:51.780 --> 09:56.380]  $400 SSD hard drive from Apple yesterday on Apple pay
[09:56.380 --> 10:01.220]  Yes, the best thing I always test drive at first just in case there's something wrong with your address or Apple pay is not working
[10:01.220 --> 10:06.180]  Right. I don't want to find that out when I'm ordering an iPhone. I'll do that with a cable or a watchband or something. I
[10:06.180 --> 10:10.580]  Just I don't know I'm already nervous
[10:11.260 --> 10:14.700]  And I keep the website open too. And the thing is it's it's never 12 o'clock
[10:14.700 --> 10:18.500]  So I just I refresh and I refresh over and over again and I feel like it's your willingness to
[10:18.660 --> 10:23.700]  Refresh until the exact moment that it actually comes live that indicates whether you're gonna get it or not
[10:24.340 --> 10:26.340]  All right
[10:26.340 --> 10:35.740]  Like a psychological experiment I
[10:36.740 --> 10:44.460]  Remember one time I said in years past what the at least for two or three years where where the XOXO conference was
[10:44.460 --> 10:46.700]  Running out in Portland. It was
[10:47.340 --> 10:49.340]  the weekend after
[10:50.140 --> 10:51.660]  the
[10:51.660 --> 10:58.180]  Event for iPhones and so my pattern for those years was I would fly out to California on Monday
[10:58.380 --> 11:02.340]  There'd be a Tuesday event where they would unveil new iPhones
[11:03.300 --> 11:07.660]  They would go on pre-order that Friday four days after the event
[11:07.700 --> 11:13.020]  But instead of flying east I would just stay on the west coast and then meet my wife up
[11:13.020 --> 11:17.020]  You know, my wife would fly to Portland but on her own and then we'd be in Portland for the weekend
[11:17.020 --> 11:19.860]  But on Thursday night we would pre-order
[11:19.860 --> 11:21.860]  iPhones
[11:21.940 --> 11:23.300]  And it's just so crazy
[11:23.300 --> 11:25.380]  I remember the one time we were it was like I said
[11:25.380 --> 11:30.340]  It was like four or five six people all doing the same thing at once and it was like I got mine
[11:30.340 --> 11:33.220]  I got mine and the next person over is like what?
[11:33.700 --> 11:37.900]  And it's and then all of a sudden they get through and they're like four to six weeks
[11:39.340 --> 11:45.060]  And it's that you know, literally side-by-side using the same cell towers with the same app
[11:45.060 --> 11:50.020]  It's it's crazy. My favorite was I think was iPhone 11 where a mutual
[11:50.380 --> 11:57.620]  Jerk acquaintance of ours set up his brand-new conference for literally the morning after the launch and I was in line all night
[11:57.980 --> 12:00.620]  Had to go buy it and then go to the jerks conference
[12:01.180 --> 12:03.180]  And I just didn't sleep that entire day
[12:03.180 --> 12:07.900]  and I think like people like Marco were trying to decide if it was better to just try to order it or just walk down
[12:07.900 --> 12:10.740]  The street and where the exchange rate made it cheaper for them or not
[12:11.580 --> 12:13.940]  You know what? I and I do feel like
[12:13.940 --> 12:18.020]  and one of the things that people forget I
[12:18.700 --> 12:22.740]  think I even I sort of forget the schedule sometimes but that the
[12:23.900 --> 12:25.900]  the reviews for
[12:26.020 --> 12:32.100]  New phones always come out at least in my memory always come out after the pre-order. Yeah start
[12:32.700 --> 12:37.620]  and and like with the iPhone 8 it was like here's the event and
[12:37.620 --> 12:44.980]  the people who got review units immediately got them either like that afternoon or the next day and
[12:45.620 --> 12:53.020]  The embargo on the reviews was like a week later, but the pre-sale started that Friday just like usual
[12:54.020 --> 12:59.640]  So the pre-orders always at least in my memory maybe in the ancient history like 10
[13:00.260 --> 13:03.340]  9 10 years ago is different but in a recent years
[13:04.060 --> 13:06.700]  The pre-orders always start before the reviews
[13:06.700 --> 13:11.540]  And and in this case, there's so much new with iPhone 10
[13:12.060 --> 13:15.860]  I mean, I mean literally it's like the entire point of the product
[13:15.860 --> 13:20.700]  Is that it's it it really is sort of a rethinking of what an iPhone is and so people have
[13:21.820 --> 13:28.100]  Legitimate questions, you know is face ID all it's cooked up to be is it you know, it is this is this a good
[13:29.020 --> 13:31.020]  iPhone honestly
[13:31.100 --> 13:35.580]  Nobody knows but I feel like it's not that big of a risk to
[13:35.580 --> 13:41.500]  Pre-order because a you can cancel if it's not going to it's not like they're going to ship them out there
[13:41.500 --> 13:42.820]  Don't ship till next Friday
[13:42.820 --> 13:47.220]  So if like reviews come out next week and it turns out to you know
[13:47.220 --> 13:51.020]  You like read these reviews and you're like, oh that that sounds terrible. You could cancel
[13:52.060 --> 13:56.300]  But the other thing is it seems like a sure thing that you'll be able to resell the thing
[13:56.300 --> 14:01.960]  Especially if you keep it new in box, you'll probably turn a nice profit on it. Well, I mean, that's the thing
[14:01.960 --> 14:03.740]  is that I think Apple just
[14:03.740 --> 14:08.420]  Assumes that anyone who's gonna pre-order is a diehard sure bet, you know, they're gonna buy it no matter what
[14:08.420 --> 14:10.340]  They're just an early adopter
[14:10.340 --> 14:16.020]  And and they just want it and it's the people who once it's in retail who aren't certain or on the fence
[14:16.540 --> 14:19.920]  And just to maintain sort of the the hype cycle from the order
[14:20.380 --> 14:24.420]  Make sure people know that it's in stores. All the reviews are cured up for that queued up for then
[14:25.740 --> 14:27.740]  hmm
[14:28.660 --> 14:31.980]  Yeah, I'll do is I mean, I know it's it's totally in their interest
[14:31.980 --> 14:34.620]  But all it would do to have reviews before the pre-orders is opt people out
[14:34.620 --> 14:36.700]  It would just it would give people reasons not to buy it
[14:37.500 --> 14:44.380]  Much rather do that before the the retail because my it might opt people in rather than or or qualify them in I forget what?
[14:44.380 --> 14:47.220]  The marketing term is before they can actually go to the store and buy it
[14:48.060 --> 14:50.060]  Yeah
[14:51.360 --> 14:53.360]  So, what are you gonna what are you gonna pre-order
[14:54.460 --> 15:00.860]  256 gig space space gray because I like the idea of the vapor coating on the stainless steel
[15:00.860 --> 15:05.300]  I don't I don't I'm not like Greg Koenig smart. I don't know if that's the same as the DLC coating
[15:05.300 --> 15:08.540]  I know DLC is a type of vapor coating but this just says vapor coating
[15:08.540 --> 15:13.660]  But when I saw it at the event, I liked the silver one was so shiny. It was like original iPhone
[15:13.660 --> 15:17.420]  It's the closest I've seen to original iPhone shiny and I really like that
[15:17.420 --> 15:22.100]  But just the the black the space gray look was nice and stealth and goes with my watch and I'm just that shallow
[15:22.940 --> 15:28.020]  Yeah, I always ordered black. I mean, that's that way. I don't have to second-guess myself
[15:28.020 --> 15:33.100]  So it doesn't matter on the front this time this time the front is the notches are all black so you can't go wrong
[15:33.100 --> 15:39.140]  Right, right, and I really do I I genuinely dislike the white faces on
[15:39.540 --> 15:43.860]  iPads and iPhones I really do I just don't like that look of
[15:44.700 --> 15:46.700]  Black screen with a white face
[15:47.220 --> 15:52.860]  But it yeah, I just don't like it. But you know, my wife loves it. I know lots of people love it
[15:52.860 --> 15:57.540]  It's obviously, you know, they've kept with it ever since they started, you know, so it's obviously popular
[15:57.540 --> 16:00.300]  But I do think that's interesting though
[16:02.260 --> 16:05.060]  You know, and I think it speaks to that I
[16:07.980 --> 16:09.740]  Just feel like
[16:09.740 --> 16:15.460]  You almost couldn't do white with that notch design. I mean and again staying away from the entire
[16:16.340 --> 16:22.500]  Subjective opinion of what you think of the notch. I don't think it would work with white. I think it just has to be black
[16:22.500 --> 16:28.700]  Yeah, because if the whole the whole way it works internally is that the the it is a full screen like when you see the
[16:28.860 --> 16:34.380]  Multitasking and the app shrinks down to its card view. It's not cut out the apps fully all the way across on the top
[16:34.380 --> 16:36.380]  It's just behind there and I think
[16:36.780 --> 16:39.680]  It sort of would draw a lot of attention to it being there if it was bright
[16:40.380 --> 16:44.580]  yeah, so it's at least a maybe for me to order the
[16:45.820 --> 16:49.340]  Silver, I guess they're not really calling it white. They're calling it space gray and silver
[16:49.340 --> 16:55.380]  And I do like the I do like the silver look on the sides
[16:55.380 --> 17:01.700]  And I it totally I think it's deliberate but it definitely harkens back to the original iPhone
[17:02.980 --> 17:04.980]  Yeah, and I silver
[17:05.100 --> 17:09.820]  It's so funny though looking at the original iPhone. Like I've gotten mine out, you know to look at it and
[17:10.340 --> 17:14.580]  I still love it. I do think it really is one of the best
[17:15.580 --> 17:17.140]  objects
[17:17.140 --> 17:21.100]  You know that I've ever owned in my life as it as a design piece
[17:21.100 --> 17:26.400]  I really do think it, you know a hundred years from now. It'll be in, you know a museum. Yeah
[17:27.020 --> 17:29.620]  But it's funny looking at how many pieces there are
[17:31.220 --> 17:36.940]  Right because the silver thing around the display was totally separate from the sides, you know, it was
[17:37.900 --> 17:44.020]  It's like an entire extra piece was this silver thing around the screen before it even gets to the sides
[17:44.020 --> 17:48.380]  yeah, and then the big antenna window at the bottom to let the RF signals out and
[17:49.020 --> 17:50.220]  Yeah
[17:50.220 --> 17:52.500]  Yeah, but I kind of like that. I like that
[17:52.500 --> 17:58.900]  I almost feel like it looks better with that big black antenna window at the bottom. There's something about it that to me
[18:00.760 --> 18:07.260]  Even though I realize it's a concession and that in theory if they could have just made the back just one piece of aluminum
[18:07.260 --> 18:08.700]  They would have
[18:08.700 --> 18:14.460]  But there's something about it that I like. I don't know. It's like pants on your iPhone. It just doesn't look naked. Yeah
[18:14.460 --> 18:21.260]  Yeah, I kind of like the look of the the new pixel twos in the same way, you know, like I kind of feel like
[18:22.740 --> 18:27.300]  At least the one that they're calling the panda, you know the white one with the black window at the top
[18:27.300 --> 18:31.620]  I kind of feel like there it's a way of owning
[18:32.140 --> 18:36.460]  The fact that they couldn't do all one material on the back that they needed a window
[18:36.460 --> 18:42.360]  Whereas the original pixel which I own I have the the black one or whatever they call whatever goofy color name. They gave it
[18:43.020 --> 18:49.780]  Quite black or something. Yeah, whatever goofy name they use but it it the last year's won the black one it
[18:51.580 --> 18:57.140]  It's it's just it seems weird that there's two materials on the back the whole thing is weird I
[18:58.420 --> 19:03.720]  Feel like the new one where where they own it and have it like is a totally separate color is is a better design
[19:03.720 --> 19:06.700]  I had the original I mean Serenity borrowed it a month or so ago
[19:06.700 --> 19:12.460]  But I had the original one I used it up until a month or two ago and it was just it was a weird
[19:12.700 --> 19:17.220]  product and it's a total tangent but I have this this this pet peeve that the
[19:17.220 --> 19:22.660]  reality distortion field around Google is way bigger than Apple's has been for years and yet they don't get called on it because like
[19:22.660 --> 19:29.300]  That was the first phone designed by Google, but it's clearly using HTC design like industrial design and people often say well
[19:29.300 --> 19:33.340]  It's like Apple uses Foxconn, but no no Foxconn designers have nothing to do with iPhone
[19:33.340 --> 19:37.980]  they have zero input in it where HTC had a lot of input in that and you can see there's antenna lines and a big
[19:37.980 --> 19:42.940]  RF window and it's like almost layered on top of each other in a rather haphazard fashion
[19:43.020 --> 19:45.180]  So I'm glad they sort of cleaned that up a lot with
[19:45.640 --> 19:48.900]  Pixel 2 XL. Yeah, well we can get into that in a minute
[19:49.660 --> 19:53.500]  But let me take a break here and and thank our first sponsor
[19:53.860 --> 19:59.060]  It's our good friends at fracture fracture is a photo decor company that's out to rescue
[19:59.060 --> 20:03.460]  You your favorite image is from the digital ether. You've got
[20:03.980 --> 20:06.220]  We're talking about iPhones. We're talking about cameras
[20:06.220 --> 20:12.300]  I'm sure that whoever you are dear listener of the talk show. Your phone is chock-full of photos
[20:12.300 --> 20:15.800]  I'll bet when you go and check out the storage on your phone that the number one
[20:17.380 --> 20:20.820]  Number one thing taking up storage on your phone are your photos
[20:22.220 --> 20:23.500]  Guess what?
[20:23.500 --> 20:25.740]  That's great. I love having them on my phone, too
[20:25.740 --> 20:30.180]  I love being able to look up photos from months ago or years ago right there on my phone
[20:30.180 --> 20:32.660]  But you know where you really want your best photos
[20:32.660 --> 20:36.860]  You want them hanging on your wall in your house or your home or in your office on your desk?
[20:37.460 --> 20:43.620]  Print them out and in real analog and you'll do you'll they'll just it's absolutely amazing
[20:44.380 --> 20:46.380]  how good
[20:46.820 --> 20:51.340]  Modern cell phone images look when they're printed out really big
[20:51.340 --> 20:56.380]  It's just crazy that it blows my mind how good they can look when they're printed really big
[20:56.380 --> 20:59.200]  Well, guess what? The best way to get your photos printed is fracture
[20:59.740 --> 21:06.300]  You send them your photos. They print them directly onto glass and they add a laser-cut rigid backing
[21:06.300 --> 21:10.820]  So they're ready to display right out of the box and they are edge to edge. There is
[21:11.660 --> 21:16.740]  Absolutely. We talked about bezels on these phones and we can argue about how big the bezel is on the iPhone 10
[21:16.740 --> 21:22.780]  There's no bezel on a fracture print. It is literally edge to edge corner to corner and it looks so great
[21:23.660 --> 21:26.180]  It's my favorite way to print photos
[21:26.180 --> 21:31.880]  I can't imagine going back to the old days of printing them on papers or take getting them printed on paper somehow and
[21:32.080 --> 21:35.360]  Putting them into a frame and what a pain in the ass that is
[21:36.020 --> 21:39.460]  Fracture you don't have any work to do. You just send them send them your images
[21:39.660 --> 21:44.820]  They mail them back to you print it on glass and then they're ready to hang right on your wall or prop them up on
[21:44.820 --> 21:46.820]  Your desk or whatever size you get
[21:47.900 --> 21:52.700]  It's just fantastic and it is I repeat this every year it is a
[21:53.540 --> 21:59.740]  Fantastic gift idea. Now. Here's the fact that I hate to be that guy who brings up the holiday season before Halloween
[22:00.540 --> 22:04.700]  But fracture always gets backed up by the beginning of December. It's too late
[22:04.700 --> 22:07.320]  You can't you can't get them as a last-minute gift idea
[22:07.420 --> 22:10.140]  So I'll tell you right now think of the people who would love
[22:10.140 --> 22:14.220]  fracture images in your family if you've got kids or pets or whatever
[22:15.060 --> 22:21.580]  think of them now write them down on a list and go do it now like at the end of October or November and you'll have
[22:22.580 --> 22:24.100]  fantastic
[22:24.100 --> 22:26.740]  Gifts already in the bag. You don't have to worry about it
[22:27.780 --> 22:29.980]  And they come with a 60-day happiness guarantee
[22:29.980 --> 22:31.340]  So you'll be sure to love your order
[22:31.340 --> 22:37.740]  every fracture is handmade in Gainesville, Florida from US source materials and they have a carbon neutral factory so you can feel good about
[22:37.740 --> 22:42.300]  That too. Here's where you go to find out and you get 10% off your first order
[22:43.260 --> 22:48.580]  If you go to fracture me dot-com fracture me dot-com slash podcast
[22:48.820 --> 22:52.580]  that's all they want they don't want a specific code for this show just slash podcast and
[22:53.540 --> 23:00.500]  Then you just mentioned the talk show when you place your order. They have a one question survey, which is where'd you hear about fracture?
[23:01.500 --> 23:05.740]  Answer it then and it'll help the show fracture me comm slash podcast go buy some fractures
[23:05.740 --> 23:10.260]  All right, let's let's shelve the pixel to discussion for a second
[23:10.260 --> 23:14.740]  Let's keep it in the back of our minds, but let's finish off the iPhone 10. I'm gonna get the
[23:15.660 --> 23:17.660]  space-gray one
[23:18.340 --> 23:25.440]  But I kind of wish there's a part of me that wishes that the space gray back came with that silver side
[23:26.340 --> 23:28.340]  Yes
[23:28.340 --> 23:35.100]  Yeah, I don't know why I kind of see why they didn't do that because it's kind of that way that they do look different
[23:35.100 --> 23:37.100]  because otherwise they wouldn't look different from the front and
[23:37.780 --> 23:40.340]  maybe I'll grow to love that that dark side, but
[23:41.260 --> 23:46.620]  I'm actually wasn't sure about what the coding was. I don't think it's the same as DLC. No, it's a deal
[23:47.260 --> 23:52.400]  Again, I would need someone like Greg to explain it but DLC is a kind of vapor but not all vapor is DLC
[23:52.980 --> 23:57.540]  Right. I will say I mean I still have my original
[23:58.340 --> 24:02.700]  DLC coded space black Apple watch the the original one
[24:02.700 --> 24:05.660]  Yeah, and I'm telling you if I wipe it on my t-shirt
[24:06.300 --> 24:12.020]  It it looks like I could take it back to the store as new in box. I mean it there is literally
[24:12.900 --> 24:17.300]  Thanks to the sapphire crystal on the front and this DLC coating on the side
[24:17.300 --> 24:23.980]  I mean like it even under like a loop there are no scratches on that. It is absolutely like indestructible
[24:23.980 --> 24:29.100]  I still have the band I still wear the band and I think we talked us before but every time I think that I've scratched
[24:29.100 --> 24:34.060]  It were hurt in some way it turns out like it's a bit of stone or other steel that it took off a wall
[24:34.060 --> 24:38.780]  Or something as I walked by yeah, we have talked about this. It is true. That's absolutely true
[24:38.780 --> 24:40.780]  like I've got some marks on mine, but I'm
[24:41.260 --> 24:42.940]  Run it under hot water and yeah
[24:42.940 --> 24:48.120]  And and you know a little bit of soap or rub it or whatever and it comes off and again
[24:48.120 --> 24:52.980]  You could take the bracelet back and be like hey, I need to exchange this. It's I didn't I never wore it
[24:52.980 --> 24:59.620]  Yeah, it's so tough. It's like Captain America shield tough. So I doubt that the iPhone has that coating but it'll be interesting
[24:59.620 --> 25:05.420]  It will be I am interested to see because it have they ever had stainless steel on an iPhone. I
[25:06.140 --> 25:12.700]  Think iPhone for the bands were stainless steel. I think it was the same stainless steel and glass sandwich that we're getting this year
[25:13.460 --> 25:16.660]  But that was sort of a brush to stainless steel or in fact
[25:16.660 --> 25:19.400]  It was not even sort of it was a brush stainless steel
[25:19.400 --> 25:25.780]  So I don't feel like like that my curiosity is whether this is gonna be susceptible to scratching sort of the way that old
[25:27.140 --> 25:32.660]  iPods work because the iPods the original ones like when the click wheel era had stainless steel backs, right?
[25:32.660 --> 25:36.400]  Yeah, the early iPod touches as well and mine it to me. It's like a Millennium Falcon thing
[25:36.400 --> 25:39.320]  It's just I'm just you have to or that book the Johnny
[25:39.320 --> 25:41.400]  I've booked that came out that you just have to accept worn
[25:41.540 --> 25:45.580]  Technology at some point or you'll drive yourself a little bit nuts trying to stop it from getting any scratch ever
[25:45.580 --> 25:52.860]  All right. I I've been thinking I don't know if I'll have time but I've been thinking before the iPhone 10 comes out of
[25:54.060 --> 25:57.300]  re-reviewing my jet-black iPhone 7
[25:58.660 --> 26:03.260]  Because it truly is one of my favorite iPhones that I've ever owned
[26:03.260 --> 26:08.820]  It's my by far and away my favorite since they went big the only one, you know, the last one I had this much affection for
[26:08.820 --> 26:14.980]  At the end of its life as I was getting ready to take take hold of a new one
[26:16.700 --> 26:20.400]  Was the the iPhone finance yeah, I
[26:20.940 --> 26:26.400]  Wanted to re-review the original because the only one I've never reviewed and just somehow we got so busy between September and now
[26:26.400 --> 26:28.400]  I didn't have time
[26:28.800 --> 26:32.800]  My thoughts on the iPhone so the jet-black thing when it was new last year
[26:32.800 --> 26:36.640]  The big thing was that Apple even on their website said hey, this thing is gonna pick up
[26:36.640 --> 26:38.640]  What
[26:40.520 --> 26:44.340]  Microabrasions was their their euphemism, but it actually it
[26:45.080 --> 26:46.400]  It is a euphemism
[26:46.400 --> 26:52.880]  But I actually feel like it is justified one year in of heavy use almost never in a case
[26:52.880 --> 26:54.880]  the only time I ever had it in a case was
[26:55.960 --> 26:59.440]  Just you know, like my review unit came with a case
[26:59.440 --> 27:03.960]  And so I tried it just to see what it was, you know, see what the case was like. I just don't like him
[27:03.960 --> 27:05.960]  so like
[27:06.440 --> 27:12.920]  98% of the lifespan of this phone has been without a case and it is the back is covered with fine
[27:14.000 --> 27:20.280]  Scratches. Yeah, but I I wouldn't call them scratches that I would say micro abrasions is actually a much better term
[27:20.360 --> 27:22.820]  There actually are a few actual real scratches
[27:23.160 --> 27:29.760]  But most of the marks on the back are you really have to look at them in just the right light to get like a reflection
[27:29.760 --> 27:36.600]  And and you know, I don't mind them at all I kind of like it it's yeah, it's very different
[27:36.600 --> 27:38.840]  It's almost like a texture. It's like in leather. They never say it's staying
[27:38.840 --> 27:39.680]  They say it's patina
[27:39.680 --> 27:44.540]  Then I look forward to be getting all Indiana Jones like with age and that's sort of what it felt like to me like this this
[27:44.560 --> 27:48.340]  Aluminum would age as opposed to the other ones which would just like look scratched
[27:49.280 --> 27:51.040]  Yeah, and and it's you know
[27:51.040 --> 27:57.240]  this jet black finish was obviously ahead of its time and I've done this because I have the review units for the iPhone 8 and
[27:57.240 --> 27:59.240]  With
[27:59.520 --> 28:06.920]  My eyes closed I I can't tell the difference between the the jet black finish and the glass of
[28:07.320 --> 28:10.160]  The iPhone 8 at least at room temperature
[28:10.160 --> 28:11.800]  I feel like maybe you know
[28:11.800 --> 28:17.720]  If I if it was cold or something, I could feel the difference between aluminum and glass but it's a very similar feeling
[28:18.280 --> 28:25.040]  To the glass of all of this year's new iPhones the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 10 to me
[28:25.040 --> 28:30.220]  It's slightly tackier. There's a tackiness to the jet black that I haven't felt on any other iPhone
[28:31.520 --> 28:35.920]  Yeah, and it's it's definitely partly why I have such an affinity for it
[28:35.920 --> 28:39.720]  Is that I just feel like ever since they got big and I've never been a plus
[28:39.720 --> 28:41.840]  I've never been in what do they call it the plus Club?
[28:42.360 --> 28:47.460]  Even even with the 4.7 the combination of the aluminum and the rounded sides
[28:47.720 --> 28:52.920]  Just makes it so much less sturdy in in grip than the iPhone
[28:52.920 --> 28:56.140]  5 5 s and and SE
[28:57.640 --> 29:03.400]  Yeah, I've used since iPhone 6 plus I have never gone back like I've used them just to review them and I'll go back and
[29:03.400 --> 29:06.200]  Forth do camera tests and things but I stuck with a plus the entire time
[29:06.200 --> 29:07.780]  I haven't had a problem with them
[29:07.780 --> 29:13.440]  But I did notice going to the 8 because the 8 is is pure glass that if if I put it on a table
[29:13.440 --> 29:17.240]  It's fine. It's not like a Nexus 4 where if you put it in the middle of a dining room table an hour later
[29:17.240 --> 29:18.680]  It will fall off the edge
[29:18.680 --> 29:23.920]  but if you put it like on a sofa on the edge of a sofa my iPhone 7 will it would have set there for
[29:23.920 --> 29:28.440]  Three or four days where the iPhone 8 will find its way to the floor within a matter of an hour or so. Yeah
[29:28.960 --> 29:30.960]  So anyway, I'm ordering
[29:31.760 --> 29:38.520]  The space black my wife will be getting the silver. Yes. I really hope this is always my fear
[29:38.520 --> 29:41.680]  my fear is that my order will go through and hers won't because
[29:43.240 --> 29:45.120]  You don't have to do both, right?
[29:45.120 --> 29:52.840]  No, I think because I think it's easier to just say replace this phone. Okay, so we always tend to do it separately
[29:54.680 --> 29:56.000]  That's a good question though
[29:56.000 --> 29:56.820]  That's good, too
[29:56.820 --> 30:00.880]  Because you like you that way if you order yours first and then order hers you're not and it comes later
[30:00.880 --> 30:03.920]  Oh, yeah. No, I think we'll be doing it simultaneously
[30:06.200 --> 30:12.740]  But that's the other question I know people have is is in be the other question besides apple.com versus the iOS app
[30:12.740 --> 30:18.660]  Apple Store app is should you do it through your carrier instead? Should you go through your carrier? And
[30:19.740 --> 30:25.380]  I feel like it's another one of those things where who knows you know what I mean? Like my guess is no
[30:26.460 --> 30:31.240]  but who knows you know what I mean like so anybody if you are they happen to be listening to this podcast before
[30:31.540 --> 30:33.540]  before the pre-orders start and
[30:33.780 --> 30:36.460]  and it turns out that the Apple Store completely
[30:36.500 --> 30:42.100]  Collapses and like AT&T and Verizon have plenty of units to go around and you missed out don't don't blame me
[30:42.100 --> 30:44.100]  I mean I'm saying I don't know but
[30:45.340 --> 30:50.140]  Yeah, I have never had luck going with the carrier because always something seems to break down
[30:50.140 --> 30:55.060]  So I've just gotten used to buying factories, you know sim unlocked right from Apple as soon as it becomes available
[30:55.580 --> 31:01.060]  But if you don't pre-order or you get such a delayed date that you want to try your luck at retail
[31:01.820 --> 31:04.620]  If you don't get there super early and there's a long line in the Apple Store
[31:04.620 --> 31:10.100]  It will it will behoove you to go to your carrier store because they might have some inventory even a Best Buy and have very
[31:10.100 --> 31:12.460]  Little lineup because everybody in the mall is already at the Apple Store
[31:13.100 --> 31:14.140]  Yeah, yeah
[31:14.140 --> 31:17.220]  I feel like if you're gonna try to sneak it in on next Friday
[31:17.220 --> 31:17.580]  Yeah
[31:17.580 --> 31:20.460]  November 3rd the last place to go is the Apple Store and
[31:20.540 --> 31:23.540]  Unless you're one of these nuts who wants to camp out for a week
[31:23.540 --> 31:27.060]  I've heard somebody told me that there's already people camping out at some of these stores
[31:27.060 --> 31:28.260]  I think weeks ago
[31:28.260 --> 31:32.920]  But there's often paid people like people who are paid as a publicity stunt to be there with a sign or something and then they
[31:32.920 --> 31:34.920]  Just take rotating shifts. Yeah
[31:34.920 --> 31:42.520]  And that's the other the X factor in all of this in addition to all of the enthusiasts who just want to get one
[31:43.440 --> 31:48.920]  Right away. And in fact, I feel like because I feel like it's gonna get back ordered four to six weeks quickly
[31:49.400 --> 31:54.920]  Even if it's not like oh I need one on on Friday, November 3rd, even if you just want one this year
[31:55.280 --> 31:57.320]  You're kind of have to pre-order tonight
[31:57.320 --> 32:02.100]  I mean, I really feel like it will be the case that if you don't pre-order tonight
[32:02.100 --> 32:09.640]  You might be looking at early 2018 delivery. Yeah, but but the X factor in this is the the gray market
[32:10.360 --> 32:17.440]  Scalpers resellers. Yeah, the scalpers and and that's another funny thing about having been in Portland for the pre-order
[32:20.880 --> 32:22.200]  Date
[32:22.200 --> 32:24.400]  The one year we were there. I don't know why that was
[32:24.400 --> 32:29.640]  I guess it wasn't even pre-orders but that they went on sale right away wasn't there one year where it was like it
[32:29.640 --> 32:33.620]  It was like pre-orders and availability were the same date
[32:34.120 --> 32:41.120]  it must have been because what I remember specifically is that our hotel was right across the street from a big mall in downtown
[32:41.400 --> 32:48.400]  Portland and there were there's an Apple store in the mall and there were people lined up literally around the block overnight and
[32:49.440 --> 32:51.440]  every one of them was
[32:52.240 --> 32:53.320]  Asian
[32:53.320 --> 33:00.680]  And it turned out a lot of them didn't even speak English and they were just they were all just buying them to you know
[33:02.320 --> 33:10.080]  On behest of middlemen who were gonna ship them all to China. Yeah. No, totally. I think I think the pre-order started later
[33:10.080 --> 33:13.400]  I think initially it was just it was available in store and online on the same day
[33:13.400 --> 33:18.520]  So I wanted that day you had to go to the store and here even in my small suburb
[33:18.520 --> 33:23.920]  there would be a line in front of the Apple store like a a sign saying line up here for iPhone and for days and
[33:23.920 --> 33:26.940]  Weeks after launch it would be there were several people from Asia
[33:27.040 --> 33:33.040]  Some people from Latin America countries that hadn't had launches yet and some people from emirate countries that hadn't had launches yet
[33:33.040 --> 33:37.100]  And they just all knew that if they got those phones, you know, that was gonna pay for their year
[33:37.720 --> 33:39.720]  Right. I have I have a friend
[33:40.440 --> 33:42.440]  who is
[33:42.800 --> 33:44.800]  Vietnamese and
[33:44.800 --> 33:50.800]  Her brother and they still have family there and her brother was going to Vietnam
[33:50.800 --> 33:56.220]  You know to visit family last year and you know the iPhone 7 wasn't that hard to come by
[33:56.300 --> 34:01.860]  He bought ten of them. Yeah and took them with him and it and resold them in Vietnam
[34:03.000 --> 34:06.420]  For cash and the money he made on them paid for the whole trip. Yeah
[34:07.320 --> 34:12.500]  Yeah, I feel like doing that in the Caribbean as well. Like he's not like a professional scalper
[34:12.500 --> 34:17.960]  It was just something he did to you know, her younger brother did just to pay for the whole trip. It's crazy though
[34:17.960 --> 34:23.920]  But imagine how how how I don't even I can't even imagine how bad that's gonna be
[34:24.880 --> 34:26.880]  with the iPhone 10
[34:26.880 --> 34:32.720]  Yeah, especially I mean it's any time demand far outstrips supply. We you we have that problem
[34:33.520 --> 34:39.480]  Yeah, and I just feel like and it's starting at a thousand dollars. It's not even gonna quickly reach a thousand dollars
[34:39.480 --> 34:45.200]  And it is distinctive, you know, and you know, there's the whole argument of you know
[34:45.200 --> 34:49.680]  How often should a new iPhone clearly look like a new iPhone and you know
[34:49.680 --> 34:55.160]  I'm of the opinion that the fact that the iPhone 7 looks largely like the 6 and 6s is not a problem
[34:55.160 --> 34:58.320]  And I think that the success of the iPhone 7 shows that
[34:59.360 --> 35:03.200]  And I don't think it's a problem that the iPhone 8 largely looks the same from the front at least
[35:04.440 --> 35:07.240]  but clearly if if you are looking to
[35:07.240 --> 35:14.060]  Have a phone that clearly is the new iPhone the iPhone 10. It's going to be very obvious and
[35:14.780 --> 35:16.780]  You're gonna be flaunting that notch
[35:16.940 --> 35:23.960]  Right and you know by all accounts that's that's a big deal particularly a big deal in China. Yeah, you know, we're status, you know
[35:25.100 --> 35:29.020]  having jewelry or cars or clothes or whatever purses and
[35:29.320 --> 35:34.140]  handbags and stuff like that as a status symbol is a huge deal and is not seen as
[35:34.140 --> 35:41.040]  You know here here in the US and Canada, I think there's sort of a modesty involved where you know
[35:41.740 --> 35:47.040]  Somebody, you know, I don't want to be seen I'm not getting a new iPhone so I can go out and flash it around
[35:47.180 --> 35:52.140]  You know, it's it's a different cultural thing. But in China where it's a big deal. I
[35:52.940 --> 35:59.620]  Really do feel like the resale value on these is gonna shoot up to I'm not joking to two thousand maybe twenty five hundred dollars
[35:59.620 --> 36:04.100]  Maybe maybe I'm even vastly underestimating. Maybe you know, it'll be even higher
[36:04.620 --> 36:10.460]  Yeah, and it'll depend exactly on how many orders there are and how fast how long it gets pushed out how soon Apple can start
[36:10.460 --> 36:11.820]  meeting demand
[36:11.820 --> 36:13.820]  Yeah
[36:13.900 --> 36:16.200]  What do you what do you make of reports
[36:16.980 --> 36:18.980]  There's you know Apple
[36:19.460 --> 36:23.980]  Doesn't say stuff like this mid-quarter and even when they do announce results
[36:23.980 --> 36:30.180]  They don't break down sales by model. You have to kind of backwards engineer it from the average selling price
[36:30.180 --> 36:33.220]  but there's been a couple of reports based on like surveys at
[36:34.500 --> 36:38.040]  Carriers that the iPhone 7 is out selling the iPhone 8
[36:38.620 --> 36:40.900]  Yeah, I've seen some good analysis of this
[36:40.900 --> 36:46.420]  There's a couple things like I remember when my father was asking me what he should upgrade to and he said, you know
[36:46.420 --> 36:49.740]  Should he get the iPhone 7 and I was asking him why and he said well
[36:49.740 --> 36:52.940]  As the Bell was offering him a much
[36:53.740 --> 36:58.460]  The discount rate for getting an iPhone 7 was so good that he didn't want to pass it up
[36:58.460 --> 37:01.780]  You know, it was just the the incentives they were putting behind it were so great
[37:01.780 --> 37:02.740]  He didn't want to pass it up
[37:02.740 --> 37:08.080]  But also I think Neil Seibert did a really good job of explaining this those surveys are hugely problematic because one
[37:08.620 --> 37:12.380]  They don't they don't have a good picture. They don't have a good look at the complete picture
[37:12.380 --> 37:18.620]  But also they're often misinterpreted and sometimes what they're mean to say is that demand for iPhone 7 was higher at this exact point in
[37:18.620 --> 37:24.020]  Time last year then demand for iPhone 8 is and that gets translated into iPhone 7 is out selling iPhone 8
[37:24.060 --> 37:27.620]  But it just really means that iPhone 7 was more popular at that point in time than iPhone
[37:27.620 --> 37:32.420]  It was an iPhone 7 didn't have to contend with another flagship phone being released just a month
[37:32.420 --> 37:37.740]  You know their flagship Apple phone being released just a month after it was but I think in general that stuff
[37:37.740 --> 37:40.820]  I usually treat it like garbage and I don't I don't mean that to be insulting
[37:40.820 --> 37:42.820]  But I don't think there's any relevant data
[37:42.980 --> 37:47.860]  In there and in less than until we hear something from Apple and we look at the ASPs and see how those fall down
[37:47.860 --> 37:51.100]  I think there's very little we can draw from it. Other than it makes again. It makes a great headline
[37:53.140 --> 37:55.100]  I
[37:55.100 --> 37:57.700]  Kind of feel the same way and I kind of feel like any
[37:57.980 --> 38:06.220]  Comparison to previous years is just off it. There is no comparison. There's you know it and it's not the I
[38:07.060 --> 38:13.460]  Forget who somebody had a column last week. I think it was Tim Colpin from Businessweek about
[38:13.460 --> 38:19.620]  It's more or less making it sound as though the iPhone 8 is like the iPhone 5c
[38:20.820 --> 38:26.260]  That it that it's a that you've got a luxury problem debuting alongside a low-cost
[38:26.780 --> 38:30.520]  device and the iPhone 8 is not a low-cost device like
[38:31.260 --> 38:37.960]  And I really do think that in an alternate world where there is no iPhone 10 yet where the iPhone 8 is the only
[38:38.220 --> 38:40.020]  new phone in
[38:40.020 --> 38:46.740]  2017 from Apple it's it's a good year-over-year up update. It's is it you know is it world?
[38:47.500 --> 38:54.260]  Shaking no, but it's good, and it's you know it's it's you know. What do you expect from a stable product?
[38:54.260 --> 38:56.260]  You know a successful
[38:56.420 --> 39:00.240]  Stable ten-year-old established product you're not gonna have an iPhone 10 every year
[39:00.240 --> 39:04.760]  There's not gonna be something as earth-shaking as the iPhone 10 next year right now
[39:04.760 --> 39:06.380]  And it goes back to that article you did for macro
[39:06.380 --> 39:10.980]  How Apple rolls and that they do gear after your iteration and this adds wireless charging and it adds
[39:11.820 --> 39:15.540]  Previous things like portrait mode and AR would peg the processor on an iPhone
[39:15.900 --> 39:21.140]  7 or 7 plus and you know that's bad for the battery and this one has plenty of headroom on it and it take the
[39:21.140 --> 39:25.700]  iPhone 7 could do photos in low-light that you simply couldn't do before where the iPhone 8 can take those photos and
[39:25.920 --> 39:29.120]  Really make them look good, and you just you have all these benefits to it
[39:29.120 --> 39:36.340]  I think the biggest lesson Apple learned was when iPhone 6 and 6 plus came out there was no new iPhone 5s
[39:36.340 --> 39:37.560]  And a lot of people were like okay
[39:37.560 --> 39:38.540]  I'm glad you made those big phones
[39:38.540 --> 39:42.220]  But I really want the smaller phone and they waited 18 months to get it
[39:42.300 --> 39:48.320]  Because as much as some people get bored other people really don't like change and this year Apple could have just in an alternate alternate
[39:48.460 --> 39:52.740]  Reality where Apple just put out iPhone 10 do it in a slew of people saying I want a touch ID
[39:52.740 --> 39:55.740]  I like touch ID. I liked having bezel something. I like the home button
[39:55.740 --> 39:59.000]  Why did Apple get rid of it and we'd wait 18 months to have an iPhone
[39:59.520 --> 40:06.020]  7 year or whatever it would be right and now people can choose if they're reticent if they just want I love everything about my
[40:06.020 --> 40:07.800]  iPhone 6s or my iPhone 7
[40:07.800 --> 40:11.500]  I just want it to be better they have that and if it's like I really am bored
[40:11.500 --> 40:13.580]  I want something new they have that and Apple
[40:13.580 --> 40:15.780]  I think they learn to cater to both of those markets
[40:15.780 --> 40:19.180]  And you have to do that when you talk it's easy when you're selling a million of something
[40:19.180 --> 40:21.820]  We're selling a hundred million all those little segments really matter
[40:22.700 --> 40:25.100]  Yeah, it's funny. You brought that up because that's actually a point
[40:25.100 --> 40:32.060]  I wanted to make is that the more I think about it the more. I think that that's really the logic between
[40:32.060 --> 40:38.940]  the iPhone 8 and iPhone 10 coming out at the same time is is really
[40:39.420 --> 40:43.620]  part of it is about filling in every price point from the
[40:44.140 --> 40:47.380]  $350 iPhone SE up to the
[40:47.980 --> 40:55.420]  What is 1150 for the the 256 gigabyte iPhone 10 part of it is about filling in every price point?
[40:55.420 --> 40:58.980]  but I think a bigger part is really about
[40:58.980 --> 41:06.380]  Having something for the leading-edge crowd like yes, give me the new new new and
[41:08.340 --> 41:12.020]  Catering to the literally hundreds of millions of
[41:12.740 --> 41:15.220]  people who are familiar with the iPhone that
[41:16.260 --> 41:21.740]  evolved year over year from from the original with a home button that you click and
[41:21.740 --> 41:29.260]  You know everything where you know because I I was confused at first when at the event
[41:30.300 --> 41:35.700]  When things like control center on the iPhone 10 moves up to the top, right?
[41:36.220 --> 41:41.740]  Well, why didn't it move to the why didn't it move there on all phones? Why is it only on the iPhone 10?
[41:41.780 --> 41:47.780]  Why not do that if that's what you need to do to have app switching from the bottom on the iPhone 10?
[41:47.780 --> 41:53.260]  Why not keep the two is as as similar as possible and the more I think about it the more
[41:53.260 --> 41:56.780]  I think it's about having a phone. That's a new phone
[41:56.900 --> 42:02.980]  That's high-end has like the same at least the the the wide-angle camera is is the same
[42:03.020 --> 42:09.160]  You know lens and sensor is on the iPhone 10. So you're getting a you know, the same great camera you're getting the same
[42:09.940 --> 42:11.140]  a11
[42:11.140 --> 42:12.780]  CPU
[42:12.780 --> 42:15.640]  Like you said there's the the digital image
[42:15.640 --> 42:16.880]  Stadia
[42:16.880 --> 42:22.380]  processor that that that takes things off the CDF takes things off like portrait mode off the
[42:22.760 --> 42:27.060]  CPU you can get all of that stuff, but it's the iPhone you're already familiar with
[42:30.000 --> 42:38.040]  Right, right and I feel but but it's also very familiar to anybody who has any previous iPhone no matter where you're upgrading from
[42:39.200 --> 42:44.000]  It it's as familiar as possible. Whereas the iPhone 10 is obviously
[42:44.000 --> 42:45.600]  it
[42:45.600 --> 42:47.920]  it's always a challenge when you have a
[42:49.080 --> 42:51.080]  massively hit
[42:51.400 --> 42:58.000]  Product in technology in the technology world to how do you keep moving forward and not grow?
[42:58.920 --> 43:00.080]  stagnant
[43:00.080 --> 43:07.480]  While still catering to the mass market that really craves familiarity and doesn't want their habits broken
[43:08.280 --> 43:09.920]  Yeah, and it's also something we've suffered
[43:09.920 --> 43:16.200]  we've literally suffered for not having before like if Apple had introduced the new MacBook it but also rev the MacBook Air or introduced a
[43:16.200 --> 43:21.520]  New MacBook Pro and also rev the existing MacBook Pro, even if it was just the new processors and things like that
[43:21.520 --> 43:25.400]  There'd be much less pressure and animosity from people who don't like the the current models
[43:25.920 --> 43:27.200]  right
[43:27.200 --> 43:31.900]  It's it's you know, I and I feel like the iPhone is so popular
[43:32.480 --> 43:33.960]  it's I
[43:33.960 --> 43:40.560]  feel like I can't even get my mind around just how many people use it and I don't think that I
[43:41.080 --> 43:43.080]  Think Apple is smart not to say that
[43:43.320 --> 43:46.440]  Everybody who gets a new iPhone gets this thing that doesn't have a home button
[43:46.840 --> 43:51.760]  That moves control center to the corner that does it has a totally different way of switching between apps
[43:54.120 --> 43:55.160]  I
[43:55.160 --> 43:56.880]  Feel like that's you know
[43:56.880 --> 44:02.360]  There's an awful lot of people who would come in and even if they don't care about the difference in price
[44:02.360 --> 44:08.800]  Are gonna look at the iPhone 10 and the iPhone 8 side-by-side and say well, I want the one I'm already familiar with
[44:08.920 --> 44:10.280]  Yeah, absolutely
[44:10.280 --> 44:13.300]  And also it does nicely solve the problem of not being able to produce
[44:13.760 --> 44:18.280]  Tens and little on hundreds of millions of iPhone tens this year. Yeah, that was my take
[44:18.280 --> 44:23.080]  You know, I wrote about that before they came out and and I do think that plays into it
[44:24.520 --> 44:26.520]  But I feel like they could have done
[44:26.520 --> 44:32.440]  They could have they didn't have to take the iPhone 8 as far as they did to have a device to do that
[44:32.440 --> 44:33.960]  You know 7s
[44:33.960 --> 44:41.160]  Right. It really is at a just checklist, you know, if you want, you know, which I you know
[44:41.320 --> 44:43.840]  I've also written about a lot is a terrible way to
[44:44.200 --> 44:47.840]  Compare products is to just make a list of features and put a checkmark
[44:48.240 --> 44:54.180]  Next to the ones that it has but when you do that comparison the iPhone 8 compares really well to the iPhone 10
[44:54.180 --> 44:59.580]  And it was interesting is I mean we talked about before the that it looks the same and that is intentional Apple read
[44:59.620 --> 45:03.580]  It's like they did with the iPhone 5s. They rebuilt that phone on one of the atomic level
[45:03.580 --> 45:05.580]  It's got all new glass all new stainless
[45:05.620 --> 45:10.140]  Sorry all new aluminum. The processors are new the internals are new the radios are new. Everything is new
[45:10.140 --> 45:12.540]  They could have made it look like anything they wanted, right?
[45:12.540 --> 45:17.900]  They they intentionally made it look exact as much as possible like an iPhone 7 or 7s
[45:17.900 --> 45:23.780]  Be it because they wanted that familiarity or they just believe at their design core that that is the best way to have a phone
[45:23.780 --> 45:27.380]  With bezels and home buttons and to change it for change of sake is stupid
[45:27.380 --> 45:33.260]  But they they made all the new stuff they have look like last year's phone. That's it. Absolutely intentional
[45:34.020 --> 45:37.860]  Yeah, absolutely. All right. Let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor
[45:38.660 --> 45:41.220]  It's our good friends at hello pillow. It's
[45:41.860 --> 45:44.320]  Hul o but they pronounce it. Hello
[45:45.500 --> 45:47.500]  So have you ever tried a buckwheat pillow?
[45:47.500 --> 45:54.380]  It's totally different from the fluffy soft pillows that everybody's used to when you think of a pillow on your bed
[45:54.380 --> 46:00.100]  You think of something fluffy whether it's filled with feathers or like polyester or something like that
[46:00.100 --> 46:05.140]  It's the same type feel a hello pillow is totally different. It is very similar to a beanbag
[46:05.140 --> 46:08.700]  It's heavy and you can pick it up and you hear these
[46:09.220 --> 46:13.500]  Buck wheats they they they rattle around like beans. It's very very different
[46:13.500 --> 46:18.980]  When I first heard about this when they first started sponsoring the show, I was like this sounds crazy that why would you want?
[46:18.980 --> 46:20.980]  A pillow like that on your bed
[46:21.020 --> 46:25.780]  But it's really really interesting and we've had one for years ever since they started
[46:25.780 --> 46:29.260]  We've had them on our bed for years ever since they started sponsoring the show
[46:29.780 --> 46:33.160]  And it really works great. It it it's totally different, but it
[46:33.720 --> 46:40.100]  Adjust to the shape of your head when you lay on it and it unlike a squishy pillow
[46:40.100 --> 46:46.020]  It stays the same all night long. It doesn't like get flatter and flatter as you sleep
[46:46.580 --> 46:51.560]  And it helps you stay cool and dry compared to pillows with feathers or foam because air still gets through
[46:52.100 --> 46:55.060]  pillows absorb and retain body heat and moisture
[46:55.980 --> 47:01.540]  Making your fill a pill warm and humid by the once you've laid on it for a while, but buckwheat tends to breathe better
[47:02.620 --> 47:04.180]  it
[47:04.180 --> 47:07.880]  It just does it doesn't get warm or anything like that. It sort of spreads the heat out
[47:07.880 --> 47:10.080]  We love them
[47:10.840 --> 47:12.840]  I've said before my son has one too
[47:12.840 --> 47:19.040]  and and we've been on vacation and stay in a nice hotel and a nice bed and like the number one thing my son looks
[47:19.040 --> 47:20.840]  forward to when we get home is
[47:20.840 --> 47:23.600]  His getting his hello pillow back. He really loves it
[47:24.680 --> 47:29.200]  Do you do the thing I do that I used to do this we use two pillows or fold your pillow and attempt to get
[47:29.200 --> 47:32.320]  Better support. Well, that's a sign that your pillow isn't thick enough or
[47:32.320 --> 47:39.040]  Or full enough. Hello allows you to sleep with just one pillow and you can you can prop it up and you'll stay supported
[47:39.760 --> 47:41.760]  And you can even add or remove
[47:43.240 --> 47:48.440]  The buckwheat fill from the zippered opening. So if when you get it you feel like well, this is too big
[47:48.440 --> 47:50.440]  This is too big. You can just open it up
[47:50.600 --> 47:56.160]  pour some of the pour some of the buckwheat out or if you want to you can order more and you can fill it up
[47:56.160 --> 48:01.400]  Even bigger and then you can do that and you can wash the case you can empty it wash the case there the beans
[48:01.400 --> 48:06.920]  The little buckwheats they stayed, you know for years. They stay they don't like break or anything like that
[48:07.160 --> 48:13.280]  It's a really really great way to sleep. These pillows are made in the USA with quality construction and materials
[48:13.760 --> 48:17.720]  it's certified or got organic cotton for the case and
[48:18.320 --> 48:21.720]  It's cut and sewn for durability that I can vouch for it
[48:21.720 --> 48:24.760]  I've had one for I don't know at least two years and it looks brand new
[48:25.960 --> 48:29.040]  Here's the deal you buy it you can sleep on it for 60 nights
[48:29.040 --> 48:36.240]  And if you don't like this pillow just send it back and they will give you a full refund go to hello. Pillow hu

[49:12.200 --> 49:14.200]  So let's talk about the pixel to
[49:15.720 --> 49:17.480]  So
[49:17.480 --> 49:21.040]  They've Google had a bad week. Yeah a little bit
[49:21.960 --> 49:24.040]  So they're the the pixel twos
[49:24.040 --> 49:29.560]  The reviews came out. I guess it was at the beginning of the week or was it last week?
[49:29.560 --> 49:35.280]  I guess it was last week. Yeah, and the reviews came out and they largely got good reviews
[49:37.320 --> 49:39.320]  But there was an interesting little
[49:42.440 --> 49:50.160]  Intra publication debate at the verge between Dieter bone who wrote their their canonical review for the two phones and
[49:50.160 --> 49:53.800]  And Vlad's above who's who's a noted?
[49:54.760 --> 50:00.120]  Android enthusiast and really likes like the the Google branch of Android phones
[50:02.600 --> 50:05.840]  Where Vlad came out after the reviews came out and said hey
[50:05.840 --> 50:12.160]  I've got to say this the the XL the pixel that so there's the regular one, you know, sort of like the iPhone and
[50:12.160 --> 50:20.040]  It was made by HTC and then the pixel 2 XL is made by LG. Yeah
[50:20.640 --> 50:28.280]  But the the smaller one has a Samsung OLED display and the bigger one the XL has an LG OLED display
[50:28.280 --> 50:30.120]  yeah, and
[50:30.120 --> 50:32.480]  the bigger ones a LED display is
[50:33.240 --> 50:35.240]  I forget what?
[50:35.480 --> 50:38.280]  Vlad called it but something like a disaster
[50:38.280 --> 50:41.880]  And said that the colors look bad images look bad
[50:41.880 --> 50:47.480]  and when you look at it at any sort of angle everything has a blue tint sort of like all the OLED phones from like
[50:47.480 --> 50:49.480]  five six years ago did
[50:49.840 --> 50:51.840]  and
[50:52.040 --> 50:54.880]  Then it turns out about a week after these reviews came out
[50:55.400 --> 51:02.680]  All the people with these review units started noticing that that the XL the bigger one was already suffering from image retention
[51:02.680 --> 51:04.680]  Yeah after after a week
[51:05.320 --> 51:07.320]  which is
[51:07.320 --> 51:14.160]  Not good. I mean they had what was interesting when you like when you do the constructed they had several separate issues and
[51:14.720 --> 51:19.280]  Full disclosure our Android site Android central. I think noted at least three out of the four of those
[51:19.280 --> 51:22.000]  They didn't have the burn in yet because it wasn't a week yet
[51:22.000 --> 51:26.720]  But they noted the three main issues I saw did ours technica and I think deeter bone did as well
[51:26.720 --> 51:29.600]  So in some publications did not but all three of those to my knowledge
[51:29.960 --> 51:33.480]  Did and so did people like like Vlad and Alex Dobie on Twitter, right?
[51:33.480 --> 51:37.480]  So basically first Google tuned the display Google went to LG to source a display
[51:37.480 --> 51:43.120]  It's the same display as the LG v30 and it's a P OLED display a plastic substrate OLED
[51:43.200 --> 51:47.400]  There's really only two companies that can make OLED at any scale and Samsung does the vast
[51:47.400 --> 51:51.600]  I think it's like 90% of it the vast majority of it and they have all OLED is
[51:51.740 --> 51:56.600]  problematic people love to say all that is great and it's the future and it might be but there's huge problems with OLED and
[51:56.800 --> 52:01.120]  Samsung has worked really hard Samsung display something that has it's really a bunch of companies
[52:01.120 --> 52:06.280]  But Samsung display has worked really hard to make good OLED LG makes really good LED for televisions
[52:06.280 --> 52:08.280]  But that uses filtering in a very different technology
[52:09.320 --> 52:15.840]  OLED is a is a umbrella term for a bunch of different display technology or implementations of organic light emitting diode
[52:16.120 --> 52:18.940]  And they sourced it from LG because for a variety of reasons
[52:18.940 --> 52:23.460]  They just couldn't get the Samsung panels probably because Apple was taking up a bunch of the supply by then as well
[52:23.600 --> 52:27.000]  So they got it from LG and the LG v30 has some of these issues as well
[52:27.000 --> 52:33.280]  but so they got these panels and then Google has really good color management now in Android Oreo and it's
[52:33.640 --> 52:39.720]  sRGB extended 16-bit float and it'll take like a Mark Edwards or somebody to explain that but basically
[52:40.160 --> 52:44.680]  apps and developers can tag the color space they want like standard RGB or
[52:45.240 --> 52:49.960]  DCI p3 or rec 2020 or whatever they want and then it's supposed to just figure it out
[52:49.960 --> 52:53.820]  But Google chose what they called a naturalistic color profile
[52:53.820 --> 52:58.780]  But to many people used to like an iPhone or even the super saturated Samsung phones
[52:58.780 --> 53:04.160]  It just looked dull and drab and it looked really washed out and you can see that in side-by-side photos
[53:04.180 --> 53:09.260]  So already it was unappealing because people really see with their heart more than their eyes that you want something that
[53:09.500 --> 53:12.460]  It's the same thing reason you have for shortening and forced perspective
[53:12.460 --> 53:19.400]  Like you want to play to people's perceptions not stark numbers in reality and Google seems to have missed that and on top of it
[53:19.400 --> 53:25.720]  As LG's peel it has this problem where if you move even slightly off axis it begins to shift
[53:26.120 --> 53:29.480]  Towards the blue spectrum. So you've got this already
[53:29.480 --> 53:32.680]  It doesn't look good and then it starts looking blue tinged on top of that
[53:32.680 --> 53:38.280]  They noticed this grain pattern when you have sort of a solid color and you're scrolling especially
[53:38.280 --> 53:43.900]  I think LG did something to mitigate that but Google didn't they just went full-on with it and you can see like a sandiness
[53:43.900 --> 53:46.960]  Or graininess, I think ours called it a dirty grain
[53:46.960 --> 53:52.220]  Inside the display which they also found off-putting and then you have the screen
[53:53.040 --> 53:56.560]  Retention issue where or burn in I don't think anyone's sure what it is yet
[53:56.560 --> 54:00.720]  But just a week later if you go to a full like if you bring up daring fireball, for example
[54:00.720 --> 54:02.720]  You'll see the the controls
[54:03.040 --> 54:09.480]  Burned in the menu button burned in at the bottom of the display and some of these things you can mitigate with software
[54:09.480 --> 54:15.480]  Like they could redo the color calibration they or the color profile and they can try to avoid the tones that bring out the graininess
[54:15.480 --> 54:21.680]  But the color shifting and and things like burn in those those are those might be problematic at the hardware level
[54:22.520 --> 54:24.520]  yeah, I so I went to
[54:25.280 --> 54:32.560]  My local Verizon superstore here in Philadelphia hoping that they had the pixel twos and it was weird
[54:32.920 --> 54:35.040]  It's a really big Verizon store here
[54:35.800 --> 54:40.040]  It's actually very close. I think not coincidentally to the Apple store
[54:40.040 --> 54:44.800]  Here on Walnut Street, and it's a big news, you know, it's good
[54:44.800 --> 54:48.600]  It's a very nice spot and it's you know, lots of glass lots of sunlight
[54:48.960 --> 54:55.940]  So I went in I'd never step foot in there before here because why would I but they even had a kiosk like
[54:56.120 --> 55:01.720]  Google pixel kiosk and I went over and it was all it was just the pixel ones from last year and I was like
[55:01.720 --> 55:05.760]  Oh rats, you know, I wasted my time coming here, but I thought I'd you know
[55:05.760 --> 55:07.800]  I'd look around and then there's like in the back
[55:07.800 --> 55:14.320]  It's like they have like a bunch of little I guess paid-for kiosks from different manufacturers, you know
[55:14.320 --> 55:16.320]  Like it's sort of like a little
[55:17.560 --> 55:21.600]  Mall within the store, you know and like so many times for carriers
[55:21.960 --> 55:27.520]  Yeah, and there's like a branded LG kiosk and a branded Samsung kiosk and it's like, you know
[55:27.520 --> 55:33.540]  I guess you know that that's just the way carriers think but then in the back wall, there's like
[55:33.540 --> 55:40.540]  Against the wall. It's sort of like here's every phone we sell side-by-side and I went over there and they had the pixel twos
[55:40.540 --> 55:47.380]  So I guess it's just that Google hasn't yet updated their little in-store kiosk for the pixel twos
[55:47.380 --> 55:48.780]  But they did have them in the back
[55:48.780 --> 55:52.140]  And so I did get to see them side by side and the the blue
[55:52.500 --> 55:58.640]  shift thing when you tilt the phone is is totally real and it's really weird and I
[55:58.640 --> 56:04.320]  I guess it's not a deal-breaker for me. Like if I really wanted to use the
[56:04.880 --> 56:08.800]  Pixel like my take after looking at the pixel X XL
[56:09.440 --> 56:15.800]  Although this was before the image burn-in thing and I'm curious how that in-store one which I guess would show the same thing all day
[56:15.800 --> 56:19.840]  Long, I'm curious how bad that if the image burn-in is bad on that one. I
[56:20.760 --> 56:24.580]  could see I kind of see Dieter's Dieter bones take where
[56:24.580 --> 56:28.220]  It it's like he acknowledges these problems
[56:28.220 --> 56:30.300]  But it's he still want you know
[56:30.300 --> 56:33.860]  He still likes the phone and I can totally see that like it's not
[56:34.140 --> 56:37.340]  And and therefore I can kind of see why Google shipped it
[56:37.740 --> 56:42.280]  Like if I really wanted and the plus-sized Google pixel
[56:43.700 --> 56:46.340]  It's not enough that would make me not want to use it
[56:46.340 --> 56:49.760]  But it is weird because like the viewing angle before you get the blue
[56:49.760 --> 56:55.560]  It any natural angle where you want to be looking at your phone. You don't see it it, you know
[56:55.560 --> 57:01.000]  But it's I I could totally see though where you're gonna get it when you're taking photos sometimes, you know
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.580]  Because sometimes when you're holding your phone in front of you, you're not looking at it straight on
[57:05.520 --> 57:10.660]  Or you're looking at someone else's phone over the shoulder or it's on a table or one of those situations. Yeah, exactly
[57:10.660 --> 57:12.660]  so I I wouldn't call it like a
[57:13.560 --> 57:18.680]  Deal-breaker, but I it's like it brings to mind what you referenced earlier. Like can you even imagine?
[57:18.680 --> 57:21.820]  If the iPhone s10 had this problem
[57:23.160 --> 57:25.160]  every biz pub for a week
[57:25.800 --> 57:32.720]  You know and part of it is part of that is justified based on how many iPhones Apple actually sells and how many pixels
[57:32.880 --> 57:34.880]  Google actually sells like
[57:35.000 --> 57:38.640]  Google doesn't sell enough pixels and the pixel isn't a meaningful
[57:40.480 --> 57:44.920]  Part of their revenue, I mean it literally might be like a rounding error
[57:44.920 --> 57:51.000]  And so part of the difference in attention that's paid to it is justified
[57:51.940 --> 57:58.520]  But yeah part of it it annoys me. There's sort of a grading on the curve thing. And the other thing too is that
[57:59.720 --> 58:04.000]  When you're choosing between an iPhone 8 and an iPhone 8 plus
[58:05.520 --> 58:08.400]  The camera is obviously different
[58:08.400 --> 58:15.560]  You can tell just by looking at the back right that this the bigger one has two cameras and the smaller one has one
[58:15.560 --> 58:19.720]  So it's right there. You can see by looking at it that there's a difference in cameras
[58:20.360 --> 58:24.380]  But the screens you're literally just buying a bigger screen. It's
[58:25.160 --> 58:28.520]  There is no difference in quality of the screens
[58:28.520 --> 58:28.880]  Yeah
[58:28.880 --> 58:35.240]  And and which is exactly what you would think without being like a nerd like us who who's totally into this
[58:35.240 --> 58:39.180]  Just as a typical consumer who walks into the store, you'd say well
[58:39.180 --> 58:40.920]  It looks like this one has a bigger screen
[58:40.920 --> 58:44.980]  But it's the same and it has a better camera and you would be right
[58:45.440 --> 58:51.460]  Whereas with the pixels they have the same camera and they look like they have the same camera and they really do so
[58:51.460 --> 58:56.520]  You'd be right to assume that but you would think looking at them side by side that they have the same screen
[58:56.600 --> 59:03.880]  But it's a totally different screen that the the screen on the smaller new pixel is so much better. It's ridiculous
[59:03.880 --> 59:07.880]  yeah, there's there's a couple of things that I think are worth breaking down one is that I
[59:08.560 --> 59:11.960]  So I ordered a pixel to excel the day of the event, you know
[59:11.960 --> 59:16.680]  It would no hesitation because every year I try to get the new Nexus and now I try to get the new pixel
[59:16.680 --> 59:17.300]  I
[59:17.300 --> 59:19.600]  Considered canceling it because I think it would bug me
[59:19.600 --> 59:25.360]  It's like Lauren Bricter can see dropped frames and he can see the little studded on the scaling on the iPhone Plus and he hates
[59:25.360 --> 59:26.760]  That you know, some people can see those things
[59:26.760 --> 59:30.560]  I think in some it's gonna bother me but not enough to cancel
[59:30.560 --> 59:33.960]  But also like if there's a bad speaker if I'm listening to a bad mp3 file
[59:33.960 --> 59:36.360]  It doesn't bother me where I have friends with like golden ears
[59:36.360 --> 59:40.600]  We're like, we're again like someone like Marco Michael running screaming from the room because he can't take that bad audio
[59:40.600 --> 59:43.340]  I'm totally immune to that. So I'm interested to see how bad it is
[59:43.860 --> 59:46.240]  but I feel like there's the difference here is that
[59:46.740 --> 59:51.200]  Google is allowed to get away with a lot of things that I don't think Apple does and it's bad for the consumer like last
[59:51.200 --> 59:55.400]  Year when Google said this is a first phone designed by Google when you know, that's clearly bullshit
[59:55.400 --> 01:00:01.600]  They collaborated on Nexus for years and that phone was put together last minute with HTC and we know this
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.180]  But they don't get called out on it
[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:08.880]  And then this year they said stuff like unlike it was sort of quote unquote unlike Apple if you buy our big phone
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.880]  There's no difference and there still is a difference. It has a bigger battery
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:17.320]  It's a completely different screen technology and it's just it's completely disingenuous and they're not called out on it
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:22.680]  And then we saw all these articles about how easy it is to make hardware and how Google's leapfrogging all the hardware
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:25.460]  You know made by Google's leapfrogging all the hardware incumbents
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:32.760]  And it's totally not true and it creates a very false dichotomy making hardware is hard and making good OLED is hard
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:37.800]  And it's gonna be interesting because I think if if iPhone 10 looks as good as and we you and I've already seen it
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.840]  but when it looks good, I think Samsung is gonna get a lot of credit and
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:45.720]  They deserve they deserve all the credit in the world for making a mature OLED panel
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:49.800]  But do you remember or care who made the LCD panel in the last three iPhones?
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:54.440]  I think most people don't and that's just as relevant as who's making this OLED. This is Apple OLED
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:57.760]  They might get like the panel the pixels from Samsung
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:03.260]  but it's Apple display team who did the sub pixel and alias things doing the color management who's doing the
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:06.560]  burn-in prevention who's doing like there is a slew of
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.700]  Apple technologies in this panel and it really is gonna be Apple's first OLED and I think
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:16.700]  Apple's first OLED compared to Google's first OLED is a relevant discussion. I
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:20.700]  think that one of the reports on I
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:24.980]  Forget who had it if it was the Wall Street Journal or Bloomberg
[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:31.900]  But one of the reports over the months before September's event on on the iPhone tends to delay
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:36.180]  And let's face it. It is delayed. Ideally it would have shipped in September
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:41.580]  But that they're not using the exact same OLED displays
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:42.940]  I mean they are made by Samsung
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:46.940]  but they're not like the same displays that are in Samsung phones apples are
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:54.060]  There it's like the description that the that story I'm thinking of said something to the effect of
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:58.340]  Samsung's has the touchscreen embedded in the display and and apples. It's a
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:03.540]  Two-step process. It's got more steps involved in is actually harder to manufacture
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:11.260]  Touch layer and they have their tone color technology. I mean, it's I think the 3d touch layer is why it's it's separate
[01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:14.620]  You know, it sounds like putting it in one component sounds better
[01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:18.020]  But I think the reason it's two for Apple isn't about making it look better
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:21.620]  But about getting touch ID in there or not touch ID a 3d touch
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:22.060]  Yeah
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:27.140]  Because previously 3d touch used the deformation of the glass as measured by the LED and all that doesn't have LEDs
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:31.420]  You've got a completely and I think they used a film based technology now for 3d touch. Yeah
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:36.700]  It yeah
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:44.420]  It's a couple of factors on this one. Is that it is it shows where Samsung really has Apple dead to rights on this
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:46.420]  like the fact that with
[01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:49.060]  Google's
[01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:50.100]  flagship
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:53.820]  Phones and they've spent a fair amount of money promoting these things like I watched
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:03:00.220]  I've been watching the baseball playoffs and the Google had a ton of commercials during the baseball playoffs for the new pixel phones
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:05.680]  I mean, they're there's I don't know if that even compares to the amount of money that Samsung and Apple pay
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:10.980]  But they're they're not like just throwing them out here and you know, putting some web ads up or something like that
[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:15.300]  But the fact that they're one that has a Samsung screen
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:19.340]  Everybody says this screen looks great and the one that has an LG screen
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:23.740]  Everybody says this is garbage and and the best people can say as well. I can live with it
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.600]  Really shows
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:30.060]  Just how
[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:36.100]  There's really only one place or only one company to go to to get a high-quality OLED display for a phone right now
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.300]  LG for watch and they use LG for
[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:43.660]  The touch bar and LG uses all that it does a stripe RGB stripe
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:50.020]  Which is you know, theoretically preferable to the diamond currently using they're using diamond pen tile in Samsung displays
[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:57.740]  Because the blue the blue sub pixel just doesn't have the lifespan of the red and green and it'll start it'll start evaporating faster
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:02.460]  And you've got to do a bunch of stuff to mitigate that and Samsung solution is pentile and they can they can do it at scale
[01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:03.820]  And LG can't yet
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:10.420]  but Apple and Samsung both poured billions of dollars into LG display and at the end Apple said we still can't use these panels and
[01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:12.300]  Google's like ship them
[01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:16.980]  So is the iPhone 10 going to have a pen tile display? Yeah, I don't know if they call it Pentox
[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:20.580]  I think that's a trademark but it's a diamond pixel arrangement where you have like the blue
[01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:23.740]  They sorry the green
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:29.340]  Oval shaped green pixels with red and blue pixels in between them. Yeah, I feel like one of the
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:35.620]  Many unknowns about iPhone 10 is something that we won't even be able to judge for a long time
[01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:38.020]  Is how is it going to hold up like after a year?
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:44.580]  Yeah, well all that has a shorter lifespan then I mean there there are technologies with OLED that have a longer lifespan
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:46.320]  But I don't believe any of them are shipping
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.860]  It has a much shorter lifespan
[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:51.380]  But that's more of a problem for TVs because you keep TVs five to ten years
[01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:53.980]  Where most people don't keep phones over five years
[01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:57.260]  But I did sort of an in because I I sort of knew about the pen tile
[01:04:57.260 --> 01:05:02.020]  Well about the diamond shape thing when we're at the event and I did a brief survey afterwards
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:04.820]  I just asked people what they thought of the display and I don't remember anybody
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:11.100]  Realizing it and that's because Apple's done a ton of stuff that nobody else has done with the anti-aliasing and things and you'll hear people
[01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:18.020]  Theoretically say well, it's not as sharp as like you can't you can't compare the resolutions because stripe and and diamond are different
[01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:22.140]  All that is true. But when punch really picky nerds, we're looking at him. Nobody noticed
[01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:28.820]  Yeah, and you know when the when the pixels are small enough the I'm and I again I'm with you
[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:32.300]  I understand I totally believe like Lauren brick dirt that he can see
[01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:32.740]  Yeah
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:35.900]  The scaling on the on the seven plus, you know
[01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:39.260]  The the plus side screens good for those who aren't paying close attention
[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:44.940]  The seven all the plus models the six the success and the seven and eight even
[01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:46.940]  Run
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:51.020]  At a 3x retina scaling factor
[01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:58.700]  But on the fly the phone scales it down to a slightly smaller to actually, you know
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:05.140]  The virtual resolution of the screen that the software thinks it's running at is greater than the actual resolution of the screen
[01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:08.500]  And so everything is actually scaled down by like 15 or 20 percent
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:12.840]  But I don't see that it's the pixels are too small for me to see it
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:18.900]  I believe that there are some people whose eyes are that good but mine aren't yeah now they can see a small flicker
[01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:23.540]  I have a friend who when they're when they drop frames on my OLED TV. He can see it
[01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:26.660]  He says it makes him sick. I totally believe him. I don't notice it at all
[01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:30.940]  I think it's like you are too. Some people get sick off VR 3d and other people don't I
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:39.340]  think the other thing and and it ties in with the pixel the pixel phones and I kind of had a I thought in a
[01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:43.500]  to me the the whole point of the pixels isn't just
[01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:51.140]  Like to me the difference between the pixels and the old Nexus phones from Google is pretty significant
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:56.420]  And I don't know. I don't see a lot of people writing about it. But to me the Nexus was
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:59.420]  Google's vision for pure Android
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:07.580]  And the difference with the pixels to me is that it's Google's vision of a of a google-oriented
[01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:14.540]  Version of Android meaning it's tied into Google Assistant and other Google services
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:20.940]  And it's not pure Android. It's pretty close. It's not like they've done like a touch whiz or whatever Samsung does
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:23.020]  It's not like they've put like a totally new skin on it
[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:30.460]  It is close to pure Android, but it's pure Android with as much integration with Google's other services
[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:34.860]  You know, it's it's the phone that Google envisions for somebody who's all in on the Google
[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:36.860]  Ecosystem
[01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:42.820]  Where you've got your goo, you know your calendars and Google Calendar all of your email goes through Gmail
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:45.700]  You're using the Google Assistant. You've got your
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:51.860]  You know, if you've got anything in your house, you're using the you know, one of those talking assistants. You've got the Google Home
[01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:58.300]  This is the phone that ties into their vision for all how all that stuff ties together and that's different
[01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:04.940]  That is very different in my opinion. And I also think personally just looking at them that
[01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:08.420]  They I wouldn't call them iPhone ripoffs
[01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:15.420]  but they are they're obviously way more iPhone like than the current LG and Samsung and
[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:19.300]  The other whatever you want to call the other top-tier Android manufacturers
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:24.220]  There is a there's a certain aesthetic to the Samsung and LG phones
[01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:27.240]  That is to me. I I don't like
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:30.560]  You know, it's it, you know part of it
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:36.240]  I don't like part of it is the hardware and part of it is just something as simple as their
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.760]  oversaturated color profiles for the displays
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:43.820]  You know the difference is the random sizing of different icons
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:51.260]  So I heard a story and I think these I think both might be true and one is that originally with the Nexus one
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:54.680]  Google just wanted to show what was possible with Android because they felt like you know
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:58.960]  The the industry wasn't moving forward as fast as they wanted it to and then after that
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.560]  They just really wanted a developer phone
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:06.840]  Then they could get into people's hands with as close to a baseline Android experience as possible as cheaply as possible to sort of spur
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:09.600]  development and app adoption and then
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:16.120]  they had a change in leadership recently and now the powers that be just really want an iPhone and part of that could be
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:21.040]  Motivated by fear which is like Android came into being because Google was afraid originally that Microsoft
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:26.720]  would have such dominance in mobile that they would get locked out of search and which was their entire business back then and
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:33.300]  Now there's sort of this fear that Samsung is so dominant on Android hardware that things like Bixby and and and Samsung pay
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:37.560]  Would lock Google out of the services that are going to be super important to them going forward
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:40.160]  So they realize that unless you control the atoms
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:45.040]  You never have complete authority over the device and they they do very much want an iPhone
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:50.880]  Which is why it's looking like the iPhone and both Google and Microsoft are amazing at getting
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:59.040]  media and everybody to talk about pixel versus iPhone and surface versus MacBook when the vast majority of people are deciding between
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:04.040]  Android phones and Windows PCs and those are their their real competition
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:06.840]  I think that's that's how Google is sort of placing this
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:14.880]  Yeah, I feel like the color calibration of the screen though says says it says it all to me where the the
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:17.240]  pixels to me are
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.400]  and again
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:24.240]  Look you can you can see this very like going to a Verizon store and going to the back table where they have all these
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:26.600]  Phones laid out you can see it and you know
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:32.080]  I can take my iPhone out of my pocket and see that the go to the same web page and see that like the photo
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:38.840]  On the front page of the New York Times looks pretty similar on my iPhone my personal iPhone with these pixels
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:42.400]  I've you know, they're all obviously got the brightness turned all the way up in the store
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:46.120]  So to make a fair comparison, I've turned the brightness up on my phone temporarily
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:51.880]  Whereas when I look at it like on a Samsung phone that the colors look garish to me. Yes
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:59.940]  Yeah, they totally get this that right and I've seen that where there are some like I may you know
[01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:03.680]  I think some people act obviously like it. Otherwise, why would they do it?
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:07.640]  Some people like it and I feel like there's other people who've gotten used to it
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:15.320]  Yeah, it's like stores on a display in a big box, right? You know, it's a big box if you're used to
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:20.720]  If you're used to Samsung's display
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:26.000]  saturation and then you're like but I you know, I'd like to try this pixel phone because I'd like to you know
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.480]  Why not get the phone right from the maker of Android and then you look at it and you'd I could see why people like?
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:38.440]  Ah, the screen looks washed out, but it's not washed out to my eyes. It's it's actually, you know, pretty pretty well tuned
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:41.600]  But it's an interesting contrast to me
[01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:46.520]  The whole thing just reminds me that all this stuff is hard and we're very easy to say like, you know every year
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.680]  Yeah, it's so much better
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:52.640]  but all this stuff is super hard Apple's been doing DCI p3 color space for a couple generations now and
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:59.040]  Managing it across devices for a couple generations. We're Android Oreo. I mean, this is the first big implementation of this and
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:04.220]  Again, like a designer will tell you that the bigger the color space the more room to hang yourself if you get it wrong
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:10.460]  Like you can really see banding and you can really see other issues and you've got to be super careful and really control what you're
[01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:12.460]  Doing there and I think none of that is trivial
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:18.360]  Yeah, and it's one of those things that since it's literally just with the version of Android that is just shipped
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.360]  it's you know and and not to
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:25.360]  Make hay over this again, you know, it's an old I mean it just is the way it is
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.640]  It's sort of like when a new and the way I look at it
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:35.080]  Is that like a new version of Android is effectively like a public beta of from three years in the future, you know
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:41.520]  like it's gonna be at least three years before there's a significant number of people running this version of Android and I know
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:48.760]  that there's a whole bunch of stuff that ships through the Google Play Store in the whatever that library is called the
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:52.520]  The whatever the Google standard Google library. Yeah
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:57.600]  Yeah, and and there's all sorts of new features that you get with older, you know
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:01.640]  Versions of Android without getting a new version of the entire operating system
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:06.960]  You can get stuff but something like this like actual true color management. You're not going to get until you get a phone
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.600]  That's running Oreo
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:12.160]  And first, you know, it's gonna be like two three years before that happens
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:17.840]  So who even knows when developers of Android apps are actually gonna bother to do the work to actually use these API's
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:21.600]  And that's the thing because they I believe they have to tag the color space they're using and if they don't it
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:23.560]  I think it defaults to s RGB
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:27.160]  But these are DCI p3 and it's it is gonna be a hard problem to solve
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:28.800]  Yeah with a bunch of hat
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:33.400]  You know again because you're dealing and Google does as far as I know they don't enforce the stuff the way Apple does like you
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:36.020]  Can put an app on the store that doesn't use the latest API's
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:41.680]  And it's fine. And if you're not doing that like you'll load up your banking app, it'll be purple instead of blue and not
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:45.540]  It's a lot of room to hang yourself
[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:50.620]  All right. Let me take a break and thank our third and final sponsor. I'm very excited about this sponsor
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:56.140]  It's new and I'm very excited about this because they have a I love what they're doing with this sponsorship
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:59.820]  The sponsor is flow flow is a beautiful project management
[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:07.340]  App for teams everywhere and it's an easy beautiful way to manage your team your project
[01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:13.320]  Track tasks stay up to date with everything that you need to do and everything that everyone on your team is doing
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:18.280]  If you're having trouble managing a busy team battling floods of emails and notifications
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:21.640]  They're just struggling to keep up with who's working on what then flow is for you
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:28.060]  Now it's no secret that most project management tools are not much to look at flow is different
[01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:33.800]  They have a world-class design team and they've worked with companies like Apple Slack Ted, you know
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:38.120]  the the conference Starbucks and it's they've worked with these companies and
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:44.460]  They've come up there. Their app is simple, but it's beautiful and easy to use and they haven't stopped there this year
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:52.040]  They rebuilt flow from the ground up to focus on making it the fastest easiest and most flexible way to
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:57.840]  Visually plan out and manage all of your team's work and along with the brand new look and feel the new flow
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:03.560]  adds a host of new features including enhanced project and task timelines a
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:07.480]  beautiful project overview board and custom
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:12.960]  Project colors to set status new work tracking views and a lot more now. Here's the great thing
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:14.960]  This is the thing that I love about this sponsorship
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:20.640]  They're offering listeners of the talk show an exclusive first look at this new version of flow
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:28.920]  You can sign up for an exclusive closed beta of the new flow by going to get flow comm
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:34.400]  slash the talk show go to get flow comm slash the
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:39.880]  Talk show and you can get in on this beta that they're doing just for listeners of the show

[01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:01.200]  So anything I want to wrap up soon. I want to get we want to get this show out tonight
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.200]  I wanted to talk about we you and I both
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:08.400]  Funny enough like yesterday. I spent my day writing about a piece that I well not just one piece
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:11.240]  But a sort of series of what I would call FUD fear
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:14.160]  That's the old fear uncertainty doubt on face ID
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:20.000]  And then you wrote one today about a really to me a weird piece at wired on
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:27.760]  on positing that core ml is is a vector for privacy expressions I
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:34.440]  Just think it's so weird that they would write this feature story about I mean it just to this wired story is more or less
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:41.140]  Like hey a scammy app could use these core ml machine learning api's and ios 11 to like
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.640]  go through your photos and
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:47.040]  Do machine learning on them to learn?
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:50.840]  What you're doing? What kind of photos you take in and send you targeted ads?
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:54.960]  Which a would be a violation of the App Store got it could happen
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.960]  I mean in theory it could happen
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:03.840]  But the the thing that baffles me is that it's just something that in theory could happen if somebody sneaks through the App Store and
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.280]  Expressly does what Apple doesn't want developers to do
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:13.980]  Meanwhile the actual companies like Google and Facebook are doing it on it
[01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:16.820]  They're rampaging your privacy on a daily basis, right?
[01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:19.460]  And what's worse is that with core ml?
[01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:23.900]  I mean if they didn't have core ml they would and it would be smarter for them to do exactly what Google
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:27.620]  Facebook and Instagram do already which is just get you to give them your photos
[01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:31.380]  It's the easiest way to take a weapon away from grandma ton cleric is to ask him for it
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:35.400]  Give me your photos and then they do all this machine learning on their servers with with this
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:38.140]  They could say find me all the pictures of bananas on John's phone
[01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:42.540]  But if they did it the old-fashioned way they would just take all your photos look for bananas one day peaches the next day
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:45.660]  Whatever the ad company wanted it. Just it makes zero sense to me
[01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:48.380]  Yeah, I don't get it
[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:54.220]  But they did it at the very end and he's the only one who was smart and they didn't learn enough from what he said
[01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:56.220]  To just not run the article
[01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:58.740]  it was funny because
[01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:00.880]  and I
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:07.980]  Hate to impugn bad motives on a writer, but it it's and I'm not saying that's necessarily what happened in this case
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:14.060]  but I I I I think it is which is that so often a writer of
[01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:16.940]  a news piece has
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:22.060]  The article the the way the article is going to go is already
[01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:27.020]  yeah in their head and then they go out and find quotes to fit it and
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:33.740]  It's it's the complete opposite of how you should go and it's complete. I know I'm not a reporter
[01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:36.540]  I don't really write news reports, but I can't tell you I've always said this
[01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:38.660]  I can't say how many times where I've started writing
[01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:43.380]  Something that during fireball thinking I was going in a certain direction and then as I wrote it
[01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:50.820]  Realized I thought something different, you know that to me thinking writing is thinking and I don't really know what I think about something until I write
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:57.020]  About it totally and then when I write it goes on away, so I can't believe they ran that quote from from will because
[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:03.980]  Basically said the article is yeah. No in my experience with stuff and I'm not a reporter either
[01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:07.100]  You know, I never went to J school. My background is not in reporting
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:09.540]  I I'm like a commenter if anything commentator
[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:13.980]  but I get pitches all the time from these companies saying we have an expert ready to tell you why
[01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:18.380]  Apple is doing this horrific thing and I look at it and a it has nothing to do with Apple and B
[01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:20.540]  It's usually not horrific even in this article
[01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:25.380]  There's like one brief aside that says also googlers to Google's tensorflow
[01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:31.720]  I like Google has been doing the biggest push into ml and they actually do it server-side and that's there's like if you want to
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:37.180]  Address ml. I don't see why it's nine hundred ninety nine percent Apple and then you know a brief man
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:41.540]  And no mention of Facebook no mention. There is no mention of anything else. All right, Will's traffic
[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:47.620]  Quote is I suppose core ml could be abused but as it stands apps can already get full photo access
[01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:52.780]  So if they want to grab and upload your full photo library, that's already possible if permission is granted
[01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:57.540]  And there the counter-argument is that they could use core ml to do it to do only a few photos
[01:19:57.540 --> 01:20:02.520]  Which you're less likely to notice but they could use geo tagging or any form of metadata to get a small sampling of photos
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:05.460]  You know, it has nothing none of this has anything to do with core ml
[01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:12.780]  So the piece I wrote published last night and I've been meaning to get this off my chest for a while and I
[01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:16.340]  thought that the the latest article at
[01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:21.820]  Bloomberg was a good good reason to do it now was to sort of
[01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:25.380]  to get off my chest everything I've learned since
[01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:30.300]  September's Apple event about the timeline of iPhone 10 and face ID and
[01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:35.860]  Whether whether and when they were trying to put touch ID in the sensor or in the display
[01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:42.020]  And go back and revisit all of this not all but because there were too many
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:46.380]  but there were just an avalanche of stories over the summer alluding to
[01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:50.540]  More alleging that Apple was
[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:58.700]  as late as July trying to get touch ID into the edge-to-edge display of the iPhone 10 and
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:03.220]  Only when they couldn't do it or ran up against a deadline
[01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:06.380]  Decided to use face ID as a fallback
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:13.100]  And I don't think that's an exaggeration that that's the the you know, it wasn't just one story
[01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:19.820]  It was multiple stories Bloomberg ran some the Wall Street Journal ran one as late as it was like just a couple of days
[01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:21.820]  before the event in September
[01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:25.300]  Still deciding John still decide and
[01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:31.900]  That didn't make it didn't make any sense to me all summer long, but I had no no sources to
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:33.620]  to refute it
[01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:38.500]  but what I've heard for years is that iPhones are on a
[01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:41.620]  more or less it's like a two-year time frame and
[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:49.060]  And yeah, and I was three I think I I've heard that too because it was you know
[01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:53.140]  It's so new and there's so much new in it, but that it's it's a really long time
[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:57.420]  Designing these things but that the last year of it is pretty much
[01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:05.060]  Locked down design wise and now they have a year to figure out how to make them at scale how to procure every single one
[01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:08.540]  of the components that they need at the price they need and
[01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:14.580]  and assemble them up to their standards, you know that it's it's you know, more or less a year and
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:17.860]  So it doesn't make any sense to me at all
[01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:22.980]  that they would as late as the summer would still be dithering over whether they could do something as
[01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:30.380]  Significant as embedding a touch ID into the display again that did and I've heard they did look into that
[01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:36.160]  That is you know, the there's a kernel of truth there, but that was something that they looked into like in 2015
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:40.280]  It was not something that they were still trying to do this summer
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:43.520]  I've been guilty of this too, and I got a very polite note one day saying dude
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:48.000]  That's like six six to the 18 month old news and I realized how long it took for the stuff to echo out
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:56.440]  And you know, I it's like I think people want it to be sort of
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:03.940]  There's like a excitement to the idea that Apple is working on something like the
[01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:05.460]  I
[01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:07.620]  Phone hardware up to the last second. Yeah
[01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:12.920]  but it just isn't it's just not the way it works and if you ever think, you know, like
[01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:16.020]  just do the math of
[01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:22.700]  You know 70 million iPhones in a quarter divide by how many the 90 days in a quarter you're talking
[01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:26.660]  Roughly about a million phones a day
[01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:30.340]  Yeah, right. It's give or take
[01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:37.140]  A roughly a million phones a day rolling out of Foxconn in China and going around the world
[01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:40.140]  If you think about how you would get a production
[01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:43.220]  Process set up to be able to do that
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:45.860]  There's
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:48.580]  There's no way that you can make changes at the last second
[01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:54.740]  No, I mean the biggest we've ever seen I think is when they broke open an iPod touch and saw the unused area for a
[01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:59.420]  Camera. Yep. I was about to bring that up and that's the one whenever I try to say
[01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:01.420]  You know, these things are locked down
[01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:08.220]  Months, maybe even a year in advance depending on the quantity and and the fact that the iPhone is so important to Apple and is
[01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:11.960]  made in such quantity and is often
[01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:18.560]  If not, usually the leading edge of technology, you know the first device Apple shipped with a touch ID sensor now
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:21.220]  It's going to be the first device they ship with face ID
[01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:26.980]  It's leading leading edge technology for the industry and the company and it ships in the greatest quantity
[01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:32.260]  that's what Williams had a great quote on that last week where he said we need we need to deliver cutting-edge technology at
[01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:34.260]  That was a mainstream technology scale
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:36.780]  Along those lines. It was really interesting
[01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:45.700]  Whenever I bring that up somebody who wants to refute it and you know, whether it's just a you know
[01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:50.660]  Random reader or listener of the show or somebody else who's like a writer who?
[01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:54.700]  Who maybe had a source from the supply chain alleging something like this?
[01:24:54.700 --> 01:25:01.100]  They always cite that iPod touch that had a was supposed to have a face ID camera and then shipped without one
[01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:05.640]  And then when when people took it apart, like I fix it you could see where it was supposed to go
[01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:10.500]  But if you think about it, that's the sort of change if anything could be done at the last minute
[01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:16.140]  just omitting apart and then not putting a hole in the
[01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:18.620]  top bezel
[01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:20.620]  Yes, exactly
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:25.580]  It's not like they added a can you know, like the thing that they couldn't do is add a camera at the last minute
[01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:30.020]  There's no way you could not do they can't do it because that's not to be filled with something else
[01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:34.020]  Right not putting the camera in and not cutting a hole
[01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:41.860]  You know poking the round hole for the the camera lens in the bezel is something you could do because you're it's it's not
[01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:43.420]  Doing something
[01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:49.840]  Right, but you can't add something you can't add just add a touch ID sensor and and the crazy part about it
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:56.520]  It's funny because I had a couple of sources people who engineers not like people not not Apple PR not
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:58.920]  people from product marketing who
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:02.160]  You might think even though I've heard from them too as well
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:07.760]  Corroborating that the timeline on this was nonsense that there was no such thing going on in the summer
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:13.240]  but I'm talking about actual engineers who worked on this project for I don't even know how long cuz
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:18.920]  They do even though they'll tell me something like that's nonsense. We decided on face ID over a year ago
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:23.000]  Yeah, I don't even know how long they were working on the project because you know, you don't ask
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:27.260]  But they they were just bat like when these reports started coming up in the summer
[01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:33.680]  No one was more confused than then the people who were involved with making the decision a year ago
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.320]  That face ID was was the way to go. Yep
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:44.060]  Yeah, I think we have on the timeline is Johnny's Haruji when he said that they were working on bionic for three years
[01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:49.140]  To get the neural nets working. Yeah, that sounds about right, right?
[01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:54.500]  That makes sense to me and that means that like what are they working on right now? They're working on like the a14. Yeah
[01:26:56.900 --> 01:27:00.860]  Yeah, no absolutely and they need I mean getting things like the neural networks
[01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:03.980]  I mean, it sounds it sounds funny, but they talk about those things
[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:05.820]  I don't know if we talked to us already or not
[01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:11.660]  But when when I was hearing about the bionic the way the language they were using was like training a pet not like programming a
[01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:16.980]  Like coding a computer it's and then they have two neural networks fighting each other essentially one to
[01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:21.700]  Authenticate your face and one to try to trick it and I don't even know if they know what those things are doing anymore
[01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:24.580]  it's like they let them loose and they just make each other better all the time and
[01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:26.860]  It's a substantial shift in the way all this stuff works
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:30.080]  And that's that's not something that you do in the last three months leading up to a device
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:32.860]  No, and it's you know, it's
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:40.500]  My understanding and you know, they have a great white paper that's already out on face ID security because they realize you know
[01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:43.540]  And naturally so that people you know
[01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:49.260]  It was it's so funny though to me that people had the exact same qualms about touch ID, right?
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:53.060]  They had the exact same qualms where they were like nervous about their you know
[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:56.780]  Rightly, so that you know, I don't know if I want my fingerprint stored in this
[01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:59.580]  Is it going to be is it actually going to store my fingerprint?
[01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:03.420]  The answer is actually no it stores like hash based on your fingerprint
[01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:07.420]  Is it going to be uploaded to iCloud or something like that?
[01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:14.500]  No, it actually stays on the secure processor can apps read my fingerprint. No because it's on a secure enclave
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:19.620]  It's not like a thing. You can only you know, an app can ask you to verify your fingerprint
[01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:21.620]  But it never actually sees your fingerprint, etc, etc
[01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:28.460]  People had all these qualms about it and and were nervous about it and combined with that thought that touch ID wasn't going to work
[01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:37.580]  Well, because other companies like sort of dirtied the water by shipping shitty fingerprint sensors beforehand
[01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:39.580]  And now here we are and people
[01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:44.340]  Want touch ID, you know or like I don't know. I don't know about this face ID thing
[01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:48.180]  I'm gonna be why can't they I might wait till next year when they bring touch ID back
[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:51.700]  I went through customs on my way to the launch event at
[01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:57.740]  Times at New York, sorry Fifth Avenue and when I got there I said the guy said where you are you coming to America?
[01:28:57.740 --> 01:29:01.620]  And I said I'm going to the iPhone 8 launch at you know, Fifth Avenue and he said oh my god
[01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:05.100]  Apple with their face ID now, they're gonna be storing our alfaya our photos
[01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:08.540]  We'll have a national CCTV database and there goes the privacy
[01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:14.620]  I've got a PIN number and no one's ever breaking it and I'm like you you just saw me do an iris scan and fingerprint scan
[01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:19.500]  Right before I spoke to you and I'm pretty sure your government stores that in an Equifax database
[01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:24.420]  There's nothing about what Apple is doing. That's scary. But what you're doing already is really scary
[01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:31.820]  I just think it's so I don't know but I do feel and I feel like that that's where
[01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:36.100]  That that these stories that have been circulating. I
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:39.420]  Don't know where they come from I get the end of the art
[01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:42.660]  I don't want to spend a lot long time in the article speculating about it
[01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:45.860]  I just wanted to shoot it down and say look I've talked to people I'm
[01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:53.240]  Who I'm a hundred percent convinced by that these decisions were made over a year ago and that the iPhone 8 or iPhone 10
[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:55.240]  I'm sorry hardware was locked down
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:30:00.940]  By the end of last year probably about a year ago, but at least by the end of last year
[01:30:02.260 --> 01:30:06.420]  But in terms of where did these rumors come from? I I don't know
[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:13.620]  I I think the simplest answer is and I think I stole it from you honestly is that it just that that's just how long
[01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:19.540]  it takes it takes nine to twelve months for decisions that Apple makes on hardware to percolate out to the
[01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:21.680]  rumor sites and to the
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:24.280]  Reporters who write stuff like this and to the analysts
[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:28.940]  That's just how long it takes takes about nine to twelve months and then so nine to you know
[01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:32.260]  Decisions that are being made at Apple like this week about next year's iPhone
[01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:38.780]  It like nine months from now will be reported as though they're that's what they're thinking about right now
[01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:44.500]  Yeah, I think the other issue is that and we they get a few things and like we've been there too
[01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:45.800]  We'll hear a few things
[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:49.460]  But it's usually out of context and the contact is critically important
[01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:54.420]  Like you can listen to this story and you can see you can hear them say Apple reduced touch
[01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:57.760]  I face ID accuracy, but that's you
[01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:03.300]  How they got there is not entirely clear to me a lot of times we saw this with Apple dual sourcing the a9
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:07.280]  Apple will say we need this component to do 10 anything
[01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:13.420]  We need this component to be under 10 and they'll say 9.3. Sure. Oh, sorry. We can only do it at scale at 9.7
[01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:18.700]  Apples like that's still under 10, right? Yes go and as long as it's under 10
[01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:24.580]  It's perfectly fine and the difference between 3 and 7 if someone wants to leak that we'll get a story in the Wall Street Journal
[01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:27.080]  Apple changes spec from 3 to 7
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:27.380]  It's like no
[01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:27.520]  No
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:33.780]  That spec was always 10 and the supplier adjusted till they could meet capacity inside that that spec
[01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:35.800]  and I think that's the sort of stuff we have here but
[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:42.340]  It's reported without the context either the people don't know it or the reporters aren't able to extrapolate it
[01:31:42.340 --> 01:31:44.580]  and it's just it's fed to us like Apple is
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.900]  conning us or
[01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:50.140]  Misleading us in some way and it's not true at all
[01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:55.060]  It's the way a product is manufactured is that and these decisions happen millions of times in every product?
[01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:59.620]  And I think it's just we're literally being made stupider by the way, this stuff is being reported now
[01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:05.820]  Yeah, the the Bloomberg story that yesterday that prompted me to write was something to the effect of that Apple
[01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:10.740]  lowered the standards for face ID in order to meet production goals and
[01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:17.300]  It very clearly suggested that face ID is not as accurate as Apple wanted it to be
[01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:23.620]  To do this whereas if you actually read the article and see what they actually have you can't draw that conclusion at all
[01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:28.460]  It could be the case that could be the case, but it there's no reason to think so and
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:34.060]  The thing that really stuck out with me of that story is they don't say when this just when this
[01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:38.720]  Lowering of a specification happened because if it happened before September
[01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:46.340]  Everything that Apple's promised about face ID like the one in a million chance of somebody else's face unlocking your phone
[01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:48.340]  Isn't that the number that they said? Yeah
[01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:55.220]  It could be based on that, you know the the the lower standard, you know
[01:32:55.220 --> 01:32:59.140]  Like maybe they were looking at one in five million before I don't know. Yeah, it's
[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:02.980]  You see that they need it. I didn't it doesn't really matter what actually they wanted
[01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:05.360]  They probably wanted the greatest accuracy in the history of the universe
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:11.100]  But the actually they needed to ship the product was this has always exceeded the act of that that level, right?
[01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:14.680]  But the story got traction because it feeds into people's
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:16.360]  suspicion
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:20.520]  yeah, that face ID is not going to work well and
[01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:27.900]  That touch ID and and and it that's this it's the exact same thing that feeds into that plus the the sort of natural
[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:30.480]  desire for the familiar that I
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:36.040]  Just can't tell you how many times I see on Twitter where some people are saying I'm gonna wait this iPhone 10 out go for
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:38.800]  The iPhone 11 next year, which I'll bring touch ID back
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:42.360]  Because people really people really believe these stories
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:47.360]  There's so I mean there's no way like one article at during fireball is not going to change the the belief
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:52.240]  People believe what they want to believe but there's an untold number of people out there
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:58.680]  Who are a hundred percent convinced that Apple tried to put touch ID and iPhone 10 failed and it'll be back next year
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:02.960]  But um, you know you and I know that is not gonna happen
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:07.280]  No, and the thing is like it's I don't want to say it's apparent because Apple doesn't communicate a lot
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:10.600]  But if you look at the way the touch ID is built, it's it's not touch ID
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:13.880]  It's biometric identification and the entire API is built that way
[01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:20.640]  Apple or the app asks for biometrics and then it's up to the device to deliver whatever it can whether that's touch or that's face
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:25.800]  Whether that's going to be something else in the future like getting it whatever the entire system is built to be independent touch
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:30.520]  ID was one possible solution to how do we make it more convenient to get into your device?
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:35.200]  But it's not the only solution and it may not be the best solution and now Apple has what they think is a better one
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:38.360]  so for them, it's like bye-bye touch ID things for all the years and
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:40.400]  Space ID goes right in there
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:46.580]  And if they think of a better thing in two years, we'll get that instead as well. All right, and one thing I asked about
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:53.520]  Privately to people who worked on it was whether it was ever even on the table to do both face ID and touch ID
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:55.080]  And the answer was no
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:59.720]  For the obvious reason that like what you just said it's just one, you know
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:04.120]  From an API perspective. It's just give me a biometric
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:11.080]  authentication yeah, so if you had both what would what would it do it would be so totally confusing like it's the sort of thing I
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:14.320]  Could see Samsung doing I think they've they even have done it where they had a finger
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:19.480]  Yeah, the guys eight has a fingerprint scanner an iris reader and a face scanner
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:25.360]  You know and and that they give you a warning that the face get their face scanner isn't all that great
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:28.360]  So you can't even use it for things like authenticating a purchase
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:33.080]  It's only for like unlocking your phone and you have to choose one or the other one works in daylight one works in nighttime
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:36.520]  They can't both work at the same time. You've got to pick one, right and you know
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:40.880]  There's all sorts of things to complain about with Apple, you know
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:48.840]  Across the board and but one thing is that they're never going to make you make decisions like that like it's goofy
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:52.480]  It would it would just be it would even make setting up the phone more of a pain in the ass because you know
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:57.880]  You'd have two things to to set up. It's the same with all I mean Samsung famously makes you switch between
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:05.280]  Profiles to get proper color for a photo versus like a movie or something and no human being is every like if if my parents
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:06.360]  Had the phone they would never do that
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:11.600]  They would just sit there and wonder why the photo looked weird or something where with apples OLED even though it's the same
[01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:15.400]  Company making the panel you you never have to worry about the color management
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:20.640]  They take care of that and they they combine that the true tone color management in at the same time
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:26.580]  Right. I mean we we'll see soon enough, you know how well face ID actually works, but
[01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:30.420]  They can't get a calculator to read all your input, but I
[01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:35.260]  Guess we should talk about that before we wrap up. That is my favorite thing
[01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:40.600]  So on the iOS 11 calculator if you type really fast
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:40.900]  No
[01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:41.060]  No
[01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:46.480]  You don't have to be like a speed typist but just as fast as you can type in like with two thumbs one plus two
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:47.380]  plus three
[01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:49.380]  You'll probably get
[01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:56.660]  24 yeah, because the second hit on the tap on the plus button won't register and you'll instead get one plus 23 and
[01:36:57.780 --> 01:36:59.780]  the reason is is
[01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:03.800]  somebody on the calculator team added like a
[01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:07.700]  4 tenths of a second animation for the
[01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:11.860]  operator buttons plus-minus dividing times and
[01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:16.780]  While it's animating you can't press it again with that's about double
[01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:20.260]  Right. That's the bug. The bug is you know, you can
[01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:23.880]  Whether you like apples slow animations or not
[01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:29.680]  And I kind of don't I kind of wish they'd speed a lot of these animations up Frank animators
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:33.980]  I love you watching their animation, but nobody else wants to sit there watching your animation, right?
[01:37:33.980 --> 01:37:38.000]  And I can't help but think that like Suruji's team is like, oh my god
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.500]  This is so much faster than it looks like
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:44.660]  This app is launched already and running and yet you're showing me
[01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:48.500]  Zooming out and zooming in it's already running which that's totally fine
[01:37:49.060 --> 01:37:51.260]  But even if you just hit the plus button over and over again
[01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:59.060]  It'll ignore every second tap on the plus button right because it's right but it it does make me wonder and again
[01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:01.060]  I'm not one of the
[01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:07.700]  I don't think Apple's software standards have gone to hell. I like I'm not in that camp
[01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:14.420]  But I do I do have my complaints and it does make me question this because if I
[01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:21.580]  Were working on iOS and I got the job of re you know redoing the calculator
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:25.260]  You know with a new design because you know, the iOS 11 calculator looks new
[01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:28.700]  I think somebody told me that it might be written in Swift
[01:38:28.700 --> 01:38:33.340]  It might have actually been one of the few first system apps that are written in Swift
[01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:35.980]  I don't know if that's true or not and I it's beyond my
[01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:43.500]  Technical abilities to investigate that but it certainly looks new. Yeah, so if that was my job to you know, here's the design
[01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:45.500]  Here's what it's supposed to look like
[01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:47.740]  And I'm writing the calculator app
[01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:53.300]  Like I'm building and running and I'm putting it on my phone and I'm doing things like typing 1 plus 2 plus 3
[01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:56.100]  like
[01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:58.780]  Yeah, I don't think you need even a separate QA team
[01:38:58.780 --> 01:39:03.500]  Like I find it baffling that even if it was just one engineer that they wouldn't have run into
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:09.020]  Wouldn't have run into this just while running their own app. That's why I smiled. I said calculator team
[01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:15.080]  I'm yeah, I don't think they need a team. I'm guessing it's you know, I think you know
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:19.500]  it's like my guess is that it's it's one engineer and they're doing several things and they have a
[01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:26.160]  list of bugs including showstoppers that they have to get done before shipping and this was somewhere on that list and just
[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:32.160]  Again as egregious as it was it didn't get gotten to and I understand it's fixed on some internal builds now
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:35.220]  It's not fixed for me at least on the current beta that came out yesterday
[01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:38.860]  But I have heard that on an internal build. It's already fixed
[01:39:42.140 --> 01:39:46.580]  You should never ever happen and it's comedic and there's many many examples of this, you know
[01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:48.580]  they totally have to get all this stuff under control, but
[01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:52.160]  and then I saw in the midst of this and it made for you know,
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:56.900]  Obviously the the Apple software is going to hell in a handbasket crowd loved this
[01:39:56.900 --> 01:40:03.780]  James Thompson who does this excellent Peacock app had a great fun with it and the Peacock Twitter account
[01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:05.780]  I should put that in there
[01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:11.860]  And it's funny it just speaks to me and my friends where I a lot of my friends are like I never noticed this cuz I
[01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:13.380]  use Peacock
[01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:16.180]  And I follow the radar and my radar account is no way tight
[01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:19.380]  Like I don't think anybody who sees my radars know who I am a totally different email address
[01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:23.020]  But I put it on and it looks like it's already been followed up on
[01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:30.660]  yeah, it's you know, it's got to be an easy fix, but it is it is kind of amusing and and it just plays into people's
[01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:34.700]  Worst suspicions about you know the state of Apple
[01:40:34.700 --> 01:40:36.620]  Well, I mean to go back to what we're talking about with Google
[01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:41.340]  Like I I think every company should be held to the standard. It's better for us if we complain about everything
[01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:43.580]  It's one of my favorite things about Syracuse is that you know
[01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:47.540]  You want to hold these companies to the highest standards imaginable and all of them to those standards
[01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:49.740]  Yeah
[01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:54.820]  And then the other thing that really cracked me up is in the midst of this discussion. I saw at least one tweet from the
[01:40:55.340 --> 01:40:57.180]  there's that
[01:40:57.180 --> 01:41:03.940]  Won't accept any criticism of Apple contingent, you know, so the opposite of the apples going to hell in a handbasket contingent
[01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:09.540]  Who said that you should just hit equals after each operation like a like a normal person
[01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:11.660]  and I really I
[01:41:11.660 --> 01:41:16.980]  looked at that tweet long and hard to try to decide whether it was being sarcastic or not and I don't I don't think
[01:41:16.980 --> 01:41:21.500]  It was yeah, I mean it is really bad at multiple like you mentioned earlier
[01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:24.980]  But like the horns I like calling the horns into the notch because it sounds more
[01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:29.420]  Federighi like to me like you even the horns like I think they're gonna bother me
[01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:32.980]  But all the people I know at Apple who've been using the phone doesn't really bother them
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:38.340]  But like you you look at the decision-making process everyone on Twitter thinks they're stupid and it's put up all these
[01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:43.820]  Why don't Apple just do this Apple tried 30 40 60 different variations before they?
[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:48.020]  chose this one and you know
[01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:54.180]  they could have not made horns to begin with that was an incredible amount of work to get the display cut out like that and
[01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:55.340]  to get the
[01:41:55.340 --> 01:41:58.820]  You know, that's a lot of silicon just to fill that display properly
[01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:01.660]  and then they chose not to pave them over and you know
[01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:06.980]  there's a whole bunch of decisions that go into all those things and you can you can totally hate them, but it's it's
[01:42:06.980 --> 01:42:14.100]  It's a choice of not having an edge-to-edge display or having one with compromises and this is not that this is just them
[01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:16.660]  Badly coding a calculator app. Yeah
[01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:21.980]  It's like the Steve Jobs is not a debate. Yeah, you're calculating wrong
[01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:25.460]  That's just the thing is they always these stories about like, you know
[01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:30.420]  If if this like Apple is lost out Steve Jobs under Steve this would never have shipped. There's
[01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:38.900]  a calendar was crap for a decade under Steve Jobs and all sorts of bad things like bad bad products bad bugs
[01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:41.780]  Bag of mobile me shipped under Steve Jobs, right?
[01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:47.940]  And you know, I I've seen that too like you're never never got these rounded corners and the notch if Steve Jobs were here
[01:42:47.940 --> 01:42:51.780]  It's like a dude. Did you ever look at aqua and Mac OS 10.0? I mean
[01:42:52.380 --> 01:42:54.380]  And he loved it, you know, yeah
[01:42:54.380 --> 01:43:00.840]  I'm at all Scott for still gets all this crap for photo realistic design, but that was not the
[01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:03.900]  Stitched leather from his private plane that we had
[01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:06.540]  find my friends I
[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:09.100]  Forgot about that in the calendar
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:13.660]  Rich Corinthian leather. Anyway, anything else you wanted to talk about this week?
[01:43:13.660 --> 01:43:16.200]  I want to wrap this up so we can get this show out out the door
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:21.580]  No, I just want to go pre-order frankly. All right. Good luck. Thank you. Wish you luck. Thank you
[01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:28.260]  All right Thank You Renee Richie everybody can read Renee stuff at I'm or and on Twitter. He's
[01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:33.500]  Easy, I just here's the one I remember I remember I often forget like serenity's
[01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:49.260]  To Twitter name but yours is easy. It's Renee Richie. Yes on Twitter. All right. Thanks. Thanks Renee. Thanks, John
