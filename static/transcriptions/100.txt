[00:00.000 --> 00:04.240]  you ever get the feeling like maybe Yosemite isn't fully baked occasionally
[00:06.960 --> 00:10.240]  so yeah so i went back in and i futzed with my input volume and i think it's
[00:10.240 --> 00:14.080]  i think it might have been that i don't know i also restarted and did about 10 other things so i
[00:14.800 --> 00:20.880]  can't tell exactly and the worst part is you just you just recorded a show two hours ago
[00:20.880 --> 00:26.240]  and everything exactly yeah i don't know what happened i i i did unplug and plug stuff back
[00:26.240 --> 00:33.840]  in but like that shouldn't happen i i i really cannot explain it now there's a new skype seven
[00:33.840 --> 00:41.760]  out and i'm telling my god no she just like keep one machine and pristine working condition and
[00:41.760 --> 00:48.000]  never unplug anything or restart it that's sort of what i do with my macbook air like i haven't
[00:48.000 --> 00:54.080]  upgraded it to Yosemite i'm i'm i'm being like old man conservative you know like if it ain't broke
[00:54.080 --> 01:00.720]  don't fix it with this machine uh and it's still you know and i i don't update new versions of
[01:00.720 --> 01:04.720]  skype it's and it still gives me problems you know like trying to be real conservative about
[01:04.720 --> 01:10.240]  what i do with the software on this particular machine uh it doesn't seem to make a difference
[01:12.160 --> 01:13.040]  i upgrade everything
[01:17.040 --> 01:18.240]  i have very little discipline
[01:18.240 --> 01:25.040]  uh did you run so you run so you have another machine you're in the beta on and stuff like that
[01:26.400 --> 01:31.680]  yeah i right it's been very complicated it's been complicated the last few months because i've had
[01:31.680 --> 01:39.440]  um i had from apple and this wasn't just like a special treat for john gruber thing it was uh
[01:42.080 --> 01:47.840]  a lot of us got it they gave us review units at wwdc like a it was a 15-inch macbook probe with
[01:47.840 --> 01:52.320]  okay somebody already installed because they actually wanted us to start using it right about
[01:52.320 --> 02:02.560]  it yeah um uh serious so i had that five of them right yeah he might have he might have needed
[02:03.760 --> 02:07.440]  he might have needed five uh but you know they gave him they gave him an iphone
[02:08.560 --> 02:16.080]  uh i don't know if you listen to atp but he got an iphone 6 so that he not to review the iphone 6
[02:16.080 --> 02:22.800]  but so he could write about the continuity features uh which was actually really really
[02:22.800 --> 02:26.320]  awesome that he you know it was a big help to him you know they've been very helpful with stuff like
[02:26.320 --> 02:33.040]  that um but that machine is gone but now i've i'm down to two machines i've got a new 13-inch
[02:33.040 --> 02:38.400]  macbook pro and i've already you know i've started life you know i just got it like a month ago it
[02:38.400 --> 02:44.320]  started on yosemite it's never seen anything but and in my old macbook air i just keep running minus
[02:44.320 --> 02:49.680]  one i had to get my my wife needed a new machine and i had to make sure i got it before yosemite
[02:49.680 --> 02:57.040]  came on everything because she would freak you think so it's just she doesn't like me to change
[02:57.040 --> 03:02.480]  their operating system no oh we've had this discussion before too but she doesn't like it
[03:02.480 --> 03:06.320]  either like you'll walk by like her iphone or whatever and like there'll be like a badge
[03:06.320 --> 03:16.160]  like a like oh yeah like oh my god 57 that thing do you update your apps automatically do you have
[03:16.160 --> 03:23.600]  the app store set see i don't have it set to update automatically but i do like like ocd like
[03:23.600 --> 03:27.360]  every time there's updates i install them but the reason i don't do it automatically is i
[03:27.360 --> 03:31.120]  want to know when there's new ones and i like to read the release now that's probably safer
[03:31.120 --> 03:38.160]  and just in case you know i i can't i can't remember the last time that i've
[03:38.160 --> 03:44.160]  had like an app that i didn't want to update it's been years you know but you know just in case
[03:44.160 --> 03:51.840]  there's like you know some kind of you know regression in an app yeah it happens like
[03:51.840 --> 03:58.000]  this definitely happen right like the equivalent of like what they did with pages and uh or the
[03:58.000 --> 04:04.400]  i work suite on mac you know going from 09 to whatever they call the new ones yeah and i mean
[04:04.400 --> 04:08.080]  basically some of that is just because of the way the app store worked the you know the approval
[04:08.080 --> 04:14.320]  process because i think normally developers would just roll back something that was you know there
[04:14.320 --> 04:18.000]  was a glitch in it or something and they can't they can't do that it's got it's you know they have to
[04:18.720 --> 04:26.240]  they have to resubmit all right yeah complicated um you know i noticed something while i'm talking
[04:26.240 --> 04:32.240]  about pages i i my big complaint and the thing that i could not stand about the update to pages
[04:32.240 --> 04:38.400]  in particular is that for the few things i use word processing for like for example with sponsors
[04:38.400 --> 04:43.200]  sometimes you know if i send them an invoice i have a pages template and it's really nice i've
[04:43.200 --> 04:50.000]  got nice typography on it um and for years now maybe even 10 years mac os 10 has had wonderful
[04:50.000 --> 04:58.560]  built-in system level typography so that like a an open type font that has uh small caps and
[04:58.560 --> 05:04.960]  alternate you know the figures the the um old style figures where the numbers drop below the
[05:04.960 --> 05:11.120]  baseline or sometimes go above the baseline um and you can system-wide you can just open text edit
[05:11.120 --> 05:17.040]  the free text you know just a simple you know the replacement for simple text go to fonts panel
[05:17.040 --> 05:20.560]  open the typography panel and you get this wonderful typography controls
[05:22.160 --> 05:25.840]  and my templates were all set up with you know small caps for certain things and stuff like that
[05:26.480 --> 05:32.480]  and pages the new version of pages last year the 2013 version dropped support for all of that
[05:32.480 --> 05:37.360]  in the name of compatibility with ios which doesn't have any of those typography features
[05:37.360 --> 05:43.200]  anymore um so i stuck with the page like pages in particular i stuck with the 09 version like
[05:43.200 --> 05:48.800]  numbers there i i don't know i don't know what the you know i'm such a simple simpleton using
[05:48.800 --> 05:54.960]  that spreadsheet that uh i didn't notice anything worse in numbers so i used the new version of
[05:54.960 --> 06:00.080]  numbers but i used the old version of pages but i noticed with the latest version of pages it's it
[06:00.080 --> 06:06.160]  is so complicated like i i they you know they had like an update with yosemite and i opened it hoping
[06:06.160 --> 06:12.080]  that the typography stuff was back and it's not like you if you create a new document in pages
[06:12.080 --> 06:16.960]  and you have a font that has true small caps not like the fake you know fakie fake small caps but
[06:16.960 --> 06:22.320]  real small caps there's no way to to turn text into small caps in the new version of pages
[06:23.840 --> 06:29.920]  but if you open in a pages 09 document in a new version of pages and you already have small caps
[06:29.920 --> 06:37.520]  it now still supports it it doesn't make it go away so it and it seems like what you can do
[06:37.520 --> 06:42.560]  it doesn't i i didn't get into it too deep but it seems like what you can do is you can open a new
[06:42.560 --> 06:49.280]  version in pages you can switch to text edit and make your text in you know use the advanced os 10
[06:49.280 --> 06:56.800]  typography features copy and paste it go back to pages and paste and it works that's weird so so
[06:56.800 --> 07:01.920]  it's really really like it it you know it's like it seems like they're making some kind of progress
[07:01.920 --> 07:06.480]  on that front but it's actually more complicated than it was a year ago when it's simple it was
[07:06.480 --> 07:12.960]  just a simple answer no you can't use those features it's like that it's like that whole
[07:12.960 --> 07:17.760]  thing they did with iMovie years ago yeah yeah when they switched from being a sort of
[07:18.480 --> 07:29.120]  a very basic traditional non-linear video editor to do whatever that was right we've been seeing
[07:29.120 --> 07:34.240]  that guy yeah it's a lot more recent what's that guy's name reindeer yeah is randy still there
[07:34.240 --> 07:40.560]  you know i he may not be there anymore that's a very good question i i heard something about him
[07:40.560 --> 07:45.760]  possibly leaving not like out of any you know that he was in trouble but sort of uh you know
[07:45.760 --> 07:50.960]  that he'd been there he'd been you know burned out you know that you know that you know just had been
[07:50.960 --> 07:56.000]  there on major major software projects for years and years and he might not be there i'm not sure
[07:56.000 --> 07:59.520]  it's a good question anybody who knows little birdies you can tell me and then i'll i'll do it
[07:59.520 --> 08:05.360]  i'm sure randy listens to the show you know you'd be surprised i'm actually i mean that was that was
[08:05.360 --> 08:11.200]  half joke but half not joke all right i actually got a very nice email from somebody at comcast
[08:11.200 --> 08:18.560]  from the show with martin last week it was actually very very nice email somebody is you
[08:18.560 --> 08:22.240]  know seems to be a true fan of the show and they said that they were they were half laughing half
[08:22.240 --> 08:28.160]  crying oh man the first hour of the show they've since been fired i don't know what to say
[08:28.160 --> 08:36.800]  they've since been fired the atp guys had a good a good bit about uh no he was not the guy it was
[08:36.800 --> 08:40.080]  the guy who i want to hear from is i want to hear from the guy who made that graphic
[08:41.920 --> 08:44.720]  i want to hear the i want to hear the story of how that graphic came
[08:45.920 --> 08:53.280]  um no but atp guys had a good bit about the the the way that the i works apps regressed
[08:53.280 --> 08:59.040]  feature wise you know and comparing contrast that with microsoft um which you know never takes
[08:59.040 --> 09:03.120]  features away if there's ever an advantage you know if word ever gains advanced typography
[09:03.120 --> 09:09.520]  features you can bank on it that it's never going to lose them in the future yeah and oh and the
[09:09.520 --> 09:14.480]  other thing that they brought up and this to me is so crazy it's like i cannot believe that it's true
[09:15.760 --> 09:19.840]  and i didn't even know it i actually have it like mark to do more research on it and
[09:19.840 --> 09:24.720]  link it up from daring fireball but apparently the new version of at least pages but maybe it's
[09:24.720 --> 09:31.680]  the whole i work suite no longer reads documents i works documents that are older than the versions
[09:31.680 --> 09:40.080]  created by the 09 versions really so like yeah so like pages like the the oldest pages document you
[09:40.080 --> 09:45.600]  can open now and then current version of pages is from pages 09 anything created with a version of
[09:45.600 --> 09:51.840]  pages earlier than pages 09 will no longer open in pages which is that is crazy crazy because i was
[09:51.840 --> 09:56.560]  about to delete the old version you know the 09 version because it puts that stuff in a folder
[09:57.520 --> 10:03.920]  and i was thinking i can just get rid of that i work 09 folder it's not no no it's crazy or
[10:03.920 --> 10:10.240]  at the very least and it sounds like such it's such busy work but you really like the sensible
[10:10.240 --> 10:15.280]  idea you know what you really need to do is find every single i works document that you have
[10:15.280 --> 10:24.080]  and open it god in like make sure see if you have seriously this is what you we would have to do
[10:24.080 --> 10:28.960]  what we will have to do is is open up every version any document we can find that's older
[10:28.960 --> 10:34.720]  than 09 and make sure it's saved as 09 at the very least i'll have to go back i'm sure i've
[10:34.720 --> 10:39.840]  got some someplace but i don't probably can't find them right now to try it but uh i will uh
[10:39.840 --> 10:43.440]  make sure i'm gonna add a note and put that into show notes and i will have a link
[10:43.440 --> 10:46.640]  where everybody can do that but i gotta write from it from there but it's so crazy and that
[10:46.640 --> 10:53.360]  you know the the atp can rightly point it out that for that is exactly like where microsoft is
[10:54.240 --> 11:01.760]  so great because like you just i'm like you know that word today like go by the latest version of
[11:01.760 --> 11:07.760]  microsoft word you know it opens a doss word 1.0 document no well you know that it does
[11:07.760 --> 11:12.640]  why would you bet against that i bet against that at all right i could probably test that too
[11:12.640 --> 11:22.320]  actually right like like if you'd set up like a 1984 like pc running like das 2 and like the
[11:22.320 --> 11:28.080]  first version of microsoft word for das i don't even know what maybe das came out later in 1984
[11:28.080 --> 11:33.120]  whatever the first year that das won you know das had a microsoft word create a document and
[11:33.120 --> 11:38.160]  save it i guarantee you that that document will open with full fidelity in today's microsoft work
[11:39.040 --> 11:47.200]  did you work did you use word back back in the back in the day no i was always a mac right man
[11:47.200 --> 11:54.640]  oh okay mac right mac okay yeah yeah i used word until what was it word six where they screwed
[11:54.640 --> 12:03.200]  everything up and then yeah and then i started using word perfect on a mac yeah really yeah we
[12:03.200 --> 12:07.600]  used my wife and his word perfect for years even like long after it had been basically
[12:09.040 --> 12:15.040]  forgotten i don't even know if i ever even used word perfect on them it was kind of nice and it
[12:15.040 --> 12:19.600]  was pretty it was for some i guess like the thing was it was always popular word perfect was huge
[12:19.600 --> 12:24.880]  word perfect was huge in the legal community i think if i remember correctly for some reason
[12:24.880 --> 12:32.960]  and then word was like everywhere else and yeah it was a big it was a big problem for a lot of
[12:32.960 --> 12:40.320]  i think and that's kind of what drove a lot of people to switch to pcs because it's like they
[12:40.320 --> 12:45.120]  were using word and they had to switch to word anyway and so they're using word perfect and they
[12:45.120 --> 12:49.360]  had to switch to on a mac and they had to switch to word anyway and so they're like well i might
[12:49.360 --> 12:56.400]  as well just switch i gotta buy a license so i'm just gonna go buy a pc one thing from that era
[12:56.400 --> 13:02.800]  was that there were no demos for commercial software and the commercial software was very
[13:02.800 --> 13:08.720]  expensive so you really your only your only options were to pirate it or spend a significant
[13:08.720 --> 13:15.840]  amount of money like probably i'm guessing you know like an like a word perfect for mac was
[13:15.840 --> 13:22.720]  probably like 149 dollars oh it's like that was like the student license yeah maybe even 199
[13:22.720 --> 13:29.040]  they were really expensive that's like like 1990 dollars you know not you know which is you know
[13:29.040 --> 13:33.600]  it's not it's long enough ago that inflation has some you know some we were still using the gold
[13:33.600 --> 13:39.600]  standard back then you could exchange you could take that dollar and exchange it for gold with
[13:39.600 --> 13:48.240]  the government no i was always a mac right mac right man and part of it maybe was just that i
[13:48.240 --> 13:53.920]  don't think i had to pay for it i think because at drexel we we had like a university-wide site
[13:53.920 --> 14:00.960]  license for everything from class and you could just go to the student center and at least my
[14:00.960 --> 14:06.160]  first like first couple of years like the early 90s like 91 92 you'd go to the student center
[14:06.160 --> 14:12.240]  with blank floppies and there was a machine where you just put them in and it would one by one you
[14:12.240 --> 14:17.920]  know you'd say i want you know the whole claris suite you know i forget what else there they had
[14:17.920 --> 14:22.160]  but you know it was like mac right and something else oh we had excel though because there wasn't
[14:22.160 --> 14:27.120]  a claris spreadsheet at the time and we had like a like a like a university-wide site license for
[14:27.120 --> 14:31.600]  excel too and you would just go there with you know you all you had to do is bring your own
[14:31.600 --> 14:36.640]  floppies and you bring your own floppies and you'd get like officially licensed install disks for
[14:36.640 --> 14:44.240]  excel and mac right you know i always like i care i can remember not getting getting unofficially
[14:44.240 --> 14:49.920]  licensed somewhere that way you could copy you could there was a lot of that shop onto a floppy
[14:49.920 --> 14:58.720]  disk yeah it's crazy that it is absolutely crazy which was like 1.44 megabytes if it was double
[14:58.720 --> 15:07.200]  density high density uh right there was like the original floppies okay you know that now there
[15:07.200 --> 15:13.520]  were 400k ones syracuse syracuse always uh dings me on this because i've whenever we go retro on
[15:13.520 --> 15:20.080]  this show i always say that they started at 800 but no they're like the like 1984s max had 400k
[15:21.360 --> 15:27.840]  uh 3.5 inch floppies and then and then 800 was for a while and then so that was a middle step
[15:27.840 --> 15:35.440]  the 800 were called double density and high density 1.4 high density ran out of numbers
[15:35.440 --> 15:40.560]  remember you could take you remember you could take a double density the 800k one and if you
[15:40.560 --> 15:48.160]  punched a hole in the corner you could it the the floppy drive would treat it as a high density what
[15:49.920 --> 15:54.640]  yeah because there was like for backwards compatibility the way that they did it was
[15:54.640 --> 16:02.400]  uh the high density the ones that were you know 1.4 megabyte capacity were the exact same form
[16:02.400 --> 16:07.760]  factor as the 800k ones so you could put it in the same drive but the way the drive would recognize
[16:07.760 --> 16:12.080]  that it was high density is that the the high density ones had a hole in the corner
[16:13.760 --> 16:19.360]  and if you took like it was that people may i don't know if you could just use a hole punch
[16:19.360 --> 16:23.360]  but there was like a thing that people made you could buy that you would you would punch a hole
[16:23.360 --> 16:30.160]  in an 800k disc and then the the drive would treat it as a high density one even though like the
[16:30.160 --> 16:35.440]  manufacturer hadn't like made it for that like that's how loose and loosey-goosey we were with
[16:35.440 --> 16:42.880]  our our data back then needless to say those floppies sometimes a little bit yeah yeah
[16:44.960 --> 16:49.120]  no that's that's how the world worked back then and you could fit you had to be able to fit an
[16:49.120 --> 16:55.840]  app on one disc i guess you could there were installers for big bigger software where the
[16:55.840 --> 17:02.400]  software would run across multiple disks and it would be like a zip file or the equivalent that
[17:02.400 --> 17:07.840]  was spread across multiple yeah right yeah i remember that i remember that you could you could
[17:07.840 --> 17:15.760]  use or you could use stuff it to spread them across multiple discs i had this is a dumb story
[17:15.760 --> 17:20.400]  but i'm going to tell it anyway i found my so i my son loves playing with the old computers
[17:20.400 --> 17:24.960]  i've got lying around because like you know because i'm a hoarder and there we have got
[17:24.960 --> 17:30.400]  a we still got to perform a 6400 and we came we went down in the basement we came across a box
[17:30.400 --> 17:35.280]  full of zip disks and he's like oh it's like what are these like oh this is we should try these and
[17:35.280 --> 17:40.160]  so so we went through this ridiculous process because so i was like okay we'll get this zipped
[17:40.160 --> 17:46.000]  i still have the zip drive so we get the zip drive out and plug it into the uh the 6400 we start the
[17:46.000 --> 17:53.600]  6400 up and there's a password on it and i can't remember what the password is and so okay that's
[17:53.600 --> 17:58.000]  fine there's a way around that and the way is like if you boot off of something else you can get
[17:58.640 --> 18:04.640]  you can get in and just delete this is the high security on on os 9 you could just delete a file
[18:04.640 --> 18:11.200]  in the in the in the system's preferences folder go into the system folder go to the preferences
[18:11.200 --> 18:15.360]  folder you just delete a file and then restart it's fine but you got to start with something else
[18:15.360 --> 18:20.000]  well that model won't start off a floppy disk so you have to start off a cd drive well the cd drive
[18:20.000 --> 18:27.360]  was broken in the 6400 so you know and i don't know why i get this compulsion to do this but
[18:27.360 --> 18:31.680]  i'm like i got to solve this problem now it's like not only do i have to solve this problem
[18:31.680 --> 18:38.640]  i got to stay up late solving this problem so i pull the drive the hard drive at 6400
[18:38.640 --> 18:46.000]  and i take it up and i put it in my my power mac my g4 power mac it has an extra drive startup
[18:46.000 --> 18:53.120]  delete the file take it back down put it back in the 6400 and as i'm putting it back in the 6400
[18:53.120 --> 18:59.920]  and reconnecting everything i have the zip drive sitting on top of the 6400 and just down in the
[18:59.920 --> 19:04.720]  basement with a cement floor and i knock the zip drive off and i break the zip drive
[19:06.720 --> 19:11.520]  i went through this huge process and in the end i destroyed the thing that i was trying to connect
[19:11.520 --> 19:20.640]  to the mac so so yeah well now i'm looking at new zip drives so i'm in the market for a new zip
[19:20.640 --> 19:26.800]  drive now i was i looked at i did look on ebay and it's like 15 15 20 bucks to get an old zip
[19:26.800 --> 19:32.000]  drive and i was like what am i doing at the point where it actually came to shelling out money my
[19:32.000 --> 19:40.320]  time is worthless but my money is not exactly like you easily burn you easily burn 10 times that
[19:40.960 --> 19:43.920]  in time you easily burn hundreds of dollars worth of hours
[19:46.800 --> 19:52.320]  like like imagine if if like somebody commissioned you to write an article that would take that long
[19:52.320 --> 19:58.160]  and then they said and it pays 15 you'd be like are you kidding no no thank you man right but
[19:58.160 --> 20:02.560]  but when it came time to actually give somebody 15 bucks for an old zip drive it's like oh man
[20:02.560 --> 20:08.480]  no way am i wasting money on that so actually i actually had you had caused to use word
[20:09.120 --> 20:15.920]  recently speaking of the price of word and you know that being able to get uh a license because
[20:15.920 --> 20:21.440]  you could just get it like an office 360 license for you can pay pay by the month and it's like
[20:21.440 --> 20:27.600]  seven bucks a month or something like that for just the regular yeah i mean so there's no for
[20:27.600 --> 20:33.680]  the mac version there's no like enterprise stuff there's no access that's true that um i saw that
[20:33.680 --> 20:38.720]  that this week and that they you know the news you know the big news story this week from microsoft
[20:38.720 --> 20:44.000]  was i mean i i don't know if it was within the last week but that they've made the the mobile
[20:44.000 --> 20:52.480]  versions of the office apps free to use like pretty much no strength for the basic functionality of
[20:52.480 --> 20:57.840]  it yes but it's read you know read read right yeah like they i think before it was like you
[20:57.840 --> 21:03.280]  could read documents but you couldn't write them and now you can you can edit them and you can't
[21:03.280 --> 21:07.840]  do track changes and probably a couple other i mean i'm sure there's some other stuff but the
[21:07.840 --> 21:12.960]  big one i think that people often use is track changes and that you have to pay for a license
[21:12.960 --> 21:18.960]  for uh and that's and they came out with android versions too oh is that oh i missed that part of
[21:18.960 --> 21:25.600]  that story that's interesting uh i think so let me i mean i think because they they definitely
[21:26.320 --> 21:32.240]  said that they were going to do that and there was some there was somebody i saw somebody
[21:32.240 --> 21:38.000]  retweeted uh yeah okay an executive from google saying can't wait to see the versions for android
[21:38.000 --> 21:43.040]  yeah microsoft office mobile is the official office companion optimized for your android phone
[21:43.040 --> 21:48.720]  you can access view and edit your microsoft word excel and i'm guessing they're right it's dot dot
[21:48.720 --> 21:58.160]  dot yeah yeah they have android versions it seems you know that and again you know it's this we're
[21:58.160 --> 22:03.040]  with microsoft where it's like almost the same boat as with apple with you know what would they
[22:03.040 --> 22:09.040]  have done if the old ceo is still there except you know balmer isn't dead but it does seem though but
[22:09.040 --> 22:17.040]  this it does seem though that this is a balmer had to go for this now yeah type of thing like
[22:18.000 --> 22:24.640]  and and it makes you wonder how different microsoft's position in mobile might have been
[22:24.640 --> 22:31.120]  if they had done years ago right like what if they had done it in 2009
[22:31.120 --> 22:39.280]  in 2009 at least for ios because let's face it but in 2009 android wasn't good as a platform
[22:39.280 --> 22:44.880]  wasn't good enough for stuff like office but if at least for the iphone they had done it then
[22:46.800 --> 22:52.720]  and then in 2010 when the ipad came out they would have already been on ios and that could
[22:52.720 --> 23:00.080]  have you know if the ipad had debuted in a world where there's already a functional microsoft
[23:00.080 --> 23:07.200]  office suite the point that could that could have really changed their you know their status
[23:07.200 --> 23:13.200]  overall in the post pc world yeah i'm just wondering if it really with so much i mean
[23:13.200 --> 23:21.120]  because office the office products aren't really tied into the way that people work as much as they
[23:21.120 --> 23:29.200]  used to be and so much of our you know the things that we produce are for the web and office apps
[23:29.200 --> 23:36.400]  are not applications are not really used for web production well for us that's true and i suspect
[23:36.400 --> 23:42.080]  it's true for a lot of the people who listen to like our shows but i my my test for what goes on
[23:42.080 --> 23:47.680]  in the real world is always the the snooping i do in airports you know not snooping but you know
[23:47.680 --> 23:52.480]  looking over what what's this guy you know as i go to the bathroom on the plane just look at what's
[23:52.480 --> 23:58.160]  on people's screens that's what i do and i've noticed a lot i've mentioned this before but i
[23:58.160 --> 24:03.200]  see it over and over again i noticed a lot of business people who you know just judging by
[24:03.200 --> 24:09.760]  their attire and judging by the fact that they have pcs and that a lot of times i see i see
[24:10.400 --> 24:17.440]  powerpoint and excel i see i see an awful lot of excel and i also see a lot of outlook email like
[24:17.440 --> 24:24.880]  pcs you know windows outlook and then like i see them like you know an hour and a half into the
[24:24.880 --> 24:30.800]  flight they fold up the the laptop and then they take out an ipad for the rest of the flight i see
[24:30.800 --> 24:35.680]  it over and over and over again right it's like they've got they want to you know they want to
[24:35.680 --> 24:42.160]  get caught up on their email or they're working on a thing in excel and as soon as they're done
[24:42.160 --> 24:47.920]  with it then for you know when it's time to like relax they go to an ipad yeah you sure they're not
[24:47.920 --> 24:55.040]  just popping the keyboard off their surface you know what it's funny i i we can make fun of the
[24:55.040 --> 25:00.080]  surface but i've i've seen more and more of them in the real world i definitely am it's no longer
[25:00.080 --> 25:07.040]  a fluke well i don't think it's selling great but it's not it's not as much it's not quite
[25:07.040 --> 25:13.600]  the punchline it used to be it it's i see more of them than i see people using windows phones
[25:13.600 --> 25:18.400]  and again maybe i'm now maybe it's just easier to notice because people if i see someone using
[25:18.400 --> 25:24.480]  a surface it's pretty easy to identify it as a surface and it's it's kind of hard to tell what
[25:24.480 --> 25:30.240]  phone somebody's using right you can usually tell iphone android phone right from the back
[25:30.240 --> 25:34.800]  without seeing the screen it's you can usually tell iphone or not iphone but if it's a not
[25:34.800 --> 25:39.440]  iphone who the hell knows what it is unless you can see the screen but on the other hand if you
[25:39.440 --> 25:46.800]  can see the screen windows phone is so distinctive ui wise i think it's pretty easy yeah and i don't
[25:46.800 --> 25:52.320]  see many of them i see a lot more surface yeah tablets did you see the whole thing where uh
[25:54.320 --> 26:03.120]  where the the on election night the cnn anchors were uh were paid to uh use surfaces have and
[26:03.120 --> 26:08.240]  then right just sort of like pretty much exactly like they've done with the nfl for like a year or
[26:08.240 --> 26:17.440]  two where every they've they've like carpet bombed the all the nfl um studio teams you know like
[26:17.440 --> 26:22.080]  where they let's go back halftime let's get here the halftime report and everybody in the studio
[26:22.080 --> 26:27.920]  has a surface in front of them while on it and cnn there were shots where you could tell that
[26:27.920 --> 26:35.920]  their their surfaces were being used to pop up an ipad it's so embarrassing everybody loves the
[26:35.920 --> 26:41.680]  kickstand everybody loves the kickstand right makes a great stand for your ipad it's i really
[26:41.680 --> 26:47.360]  do mean this i i think it's like a marketing move that's actually worse it was overall the
[26:47.360 --> 26:52.800]  the overall net effect of that campaign that was was actually worse because i think there were more
[26:52.800 --> 26:57.680]  people who noticed you know who caught on to the i you know they were actually propping up ipads
[26:57.680 --> 27:05.600]  angle than who noticed you know from tv like hey it looks like a microsoft surface it's actually
[27:05.600 --> 27:09.760]  worse i think it actually hurts their their efforts because it makes it seem like their
[27:09.760 --> 27:16.640]  products a joke i'm actually in the mark i might be in the market for a for a pc because my son
[27:17.520 --> 27:24.640]  who likes to play games and has his most of his buddies are pc users he's got like this
[27:24.640 --> 27:31.040]  identification thing now where he wants to get a he wants to get a pc and it's like some of the
[27:31.040 --> 27:36.560]  some of the minecraft stuff is actually a little bit easier to manage and because some of the on a
[27:36.560 --> 27:42.000]  on a pc because the install there are specific installers that are written for windows instead of
[27:43.520 --> 27:49.600]  other clients and where they're less they're more generic on the mac and linux
[27:50.560 --> 27:57.280]  so so the it's an it's a weird problem to have to be in this in that market because
[27:57.280 --> 28:03.840]  i can't figure out what i mean i have no idea what to get like trying to find a laptop a windows
[28:03.840 --> 28:11.520]  laptop that is you know with my with my mac standard it's really difficult there's nothing
[28:11.520 --> 28:20.160]  of the same quality at least not in the same kind of price range most of the stuff is uh plastic and
[28:20.160 --> 28:26.400]  the higher end stuff like there's the razor blade is supposed to be a great gaming laptop pc
[28:26.400 --> 28:32.720]  pc but he wants a laptop yeah well i think he should have a laptop yeah um he likes to yeah i
[28:32.720 --> 28:39.120]  mean he moves around a lot and and you know he'd like to take it with him when we travel and stuff
[28:39.120 --> 28:45.360]  like that so but the razor the razor blade starts at like 1900 bucks and i'm not going to give you
[28:45.360 --> 28:50.720]  know he's going to spill like a like a 1900 dollars 1900 dollars for a start starting price
[28:50.720 --> 28:54.960]  for a razor blade yeah it's a nice looking it's a nice looking computer i mean it's like it's like
[28:54.960 --> 29:00.800]  a black you know looks like a i say that i i just realized that i said that like i was totally
[29:00.800 --> 29:08.720]  offended and i just i just blew i just blew like 3500 on my my macbook pro which i didn't blink at
[29:08.720 --> 29:13.200]  because i know that it's an excellent machine and it's made of aluminum and has an ssd and a retina
[29:13.200 --> 29:17.840]  screen and it's from apple and it's really nice and i just assume that the nicest pc there is
[29:17.840 --> 29:24.880]  couldn't possibly cost that much i realized that's that that was a very biased thing for me to be
[29:24.880 --> 29:31.520]  outraged no i can totally you know you don't buy a 10-year-old 1900 no i'm not buying a 1900 laptop
[29:31.520 --> 29:36.000]  and then the other ones are the alien the alien wares are supposedly decent gaming laptops but
[29:36.000 --> 29:44.800]  they start 11 like 1100 and i don't know they're big clunky you know they're so it wouldn't you
[29:44.800 --> 29:49.840]  know and i'm not sure if this is this experiment is going to take or not do you you don't think
[29:49.840 --> 29:58.560]  though that um uh uh what's it called uh when you reboot a mac into windows camp boot camp boot camp
[29:58.560 --> 30:04.320]  is not the solution well he needs a new machine because he's he's using an old he's using my old
[30:04.320 --> 30:10.000]  macbook pro which is like a 2010 all right and he's you know he's banged it up pretty
[30:10.000 --> 30:16.240]  well and the truth is i mean i i mean among you know there's what there's video editing i mean
[30:16.240 --> 30:21.280]  there's a few things that that work-wise really push a machine these days but gaming it's always
[30:21.280 --> 30:26.560]  going to be at always i mean until the end of our lives it's gonna you know there's never going to be
[30:28.160 --> 30:34.480]  a decrease in pushing the limits of computing you know and then gaining a four-year-old computer in
[30:34.480 --> 30:40.800]  the gaming world is ancient combine that with the fact that macbooks aren't exactly known for being
[30:40.800 --> 30:44.560]  optimized for gaming in the first place when they're brand new and you can really you know
[30:44.560 --> 30:49.040]  i can see how it's a problem yeah i mean so i could get you know i could get like a seven
[30:49.040 --> 30:56.880]  hundred dollar lenovo that has a nice video card in it i mean the thing is made out of plastic the
[30:56.880 --> 31:01.760]  outside is terrible but it comes with eight gigs of ram and it's got a good video card in it
[31:01.760 --> 31:05.680]  well hold that thought let's come back to this let me take a break and thank our first sponsor
[31:05.680 --> 31:08.080]  but we'll come back to this because it ties into something else it's lenovo
[31:10.400 --> 31:16.640]  it's our good friends at uh squarespace now you guys know squarespace there it's a great way to
[31:16.640 --> 31:23.040]  build your own website uh i just think back to what it was like before things like squarespace
[31:23.040 --> 31:28.720]  existed where if you wanted to start a new website and you had to start in something like bbedit with
[31:28.720 --> 31:35.040]  new document and that's that's where you're starting from it was daunting like and it would
[31:35.040 --> 31:38.960]  you know you'd only start a new website if you really had wanted to devote a lot of time to just
[31:38.960 --> 31:45.280]  getting it off the ground whereas with squarespace if you have an idea for a new website you can
[31:45.280 --> 31:51.680]  actually like have the website up and running in like minutes instead of days it's amazing it's
[31:51.680 --> 31:58.240]  just a totally different world and so much easier now they've been around for a while they've been
[31:58.240 --> 32:02.800]  sponsoring this show and other shows for a while i know you've heard about them but they've just
[32:02.800 --> 32:09.200]  launched what they're calling squarespace seven and you can go to squarespace.com slash seven
[32:09.200 --> 32:15.120]  s-e-v-e-n spell it out for more information on the stuff that's new but the key points they've
[32:15.120 --> 32:20.320]  got a redesigned squarespace 7 interface and it's really really easy to build your own website
[32:20.320 --> 32:25.360]  and it's really really nice i think their old interface was nice but the new one is even better
[32:26.640 --> 32:33.040]  integration with google apps which is huge for a lot of places that are you know all in on google
[32:33.040 --> 32:40.080]  apps they have a partnership with getti images so it's a lot easier it's just built right into

[34:55.440 --> 35:01.920]  all right so to me that your your story about you know not knowing what what to get for your
[35:01.920 --> 35:09.280]  for hank for a pc is i feel the exact same way and i feel like it's just one of those it's it's a
[35:10.640 --> 35:17.120]  chasm between apple people and pc people that's only widened over the years because to me one of
[35:17.120 --> 35:21.360]  the great things about being all in on the apple platform is that it's so easy to know what the
[35:21.360 --> 35:28.000]  best thing to get is right you know if i want the best ipad i know to get the ipad air 2 and
[35:28.000 --> 35:33.600]  you know just decide which color i want and whether i want cellular and you know how much
[35:33.600 --> 35:38.160]  storage i want and that's it whereas if i want the best android tablet who knows what it is if
[35:38.160 --> 35:46.000]  i want the best windows gaming pc who knows yeah i mean there's there's some some like i said
[35:46.000 --> 35:51.680]  there's a few manufacturers that specialize in that kind of thing um and but you know you go to
[35:51.680 --> 35:58.480]  going to lenovo's site too and i mean and i kind of leaning towards lenovo just because i don't
[35:58.480 --> 36:02.720]  know i mean they've heard that they're okay is as opposed to some of the rest of them it seems like
[36:02.720 --> 36:06.800]  a lot of the other ones really have decreased in quality over the years and you know a bunch of
[36:06.800 --> 36:15.520]  people gone out of business and people get bought and the dizzying array of options that you're
[36:15.520 --> 36:23.520]  options that you're presented with for just laptops is on just lenovo's site is ridiculous
[36:23.520 --> 36:28.080]  i mean i can't make heads or tails of any of this stuff and there's a section for there is a you know
[36:28.880 --> 36:35.680]  there's like it's like a matrix it's like a product matrix of different numbers and within
[36:35.680 --> 36:40.880]  those numbers they'll say one's good for home one good one's good for gaming one's good for business
[36:40.880 --> 36:45.840]  but i don't know but then you have to basically like navigate through those numbers and like that
[36:45.840 --> 36:50.720]  doesn't make any sense to me though yeah i mean gaming is to me either gaming is the only one that
[36:50.720 --> 36:56.320]  makes sense to me because gaming means it's going to have uh high-powered graphics if if they're
[36:56.320 --> 37:00.880]  being honest and saying this one's good for gaming that's you know it's got to be it means it's good
[37:00.880 --> 37:06.960]  good graphics uh or at least gaming optimized graphics because you know it's it's you know
[37:06.960 --> 37:13.040]  you could have like a like a mac pro might have very powerful graphics but it's probably a more
[37:13.040 --> 37:18.080]  you know the drivers are more optimized towards professional applications than gaming whereas a
[37:18.080 --> 37:23.200]  gaming pc you know what it means it means you know it's set up for all the stuff on steam to
[37:23.200 --> 37:27.920]  be optimized you know right right but what's the difference between a machine that's good for home
[37:27.920 --> 37:33.200]  and good for business i i mean i guess that home is mostly just considered email and web surfing
[37:33.200 --> 37:37.440]  and why this i don't know and business and i always get the sense that business is
[37:37.440 --> 37:44.320]  somebody else is paying for this so this is a more expensive computer see i don't know i kind
[37:44.320 --> 37:50.480]  of feel like it's such an artificial distinction that it dates back to the you know like back to
[37:50.480 --> 37:56.880]  when we were talking with like word five and word six like 1989 and 90 when like business would want
[37:56.880 --> 38:04.240]  like a networking card like when it was a card that you actually had to install in the back of
[38:04.240 --> 38:09.040]  the computer so you could plug ethernet in or something like that and an ethernet card was a
[38:09.040 --> 38:12.720]  couple hundred bucks and it was expensive and there's no way you'd want that at home because
[38:12.720 --> 38:19.680]  nobody had ethernet at home yeah and so there were you know like physical differences between
[38:19.680 --> 38:24.880]  what you'd want in a business environment than a home environment whereas it's a distinction
[38:24.880 --> 38:29.760]  that's meaningless today i mean there's a reason why apple doesn't have business versus home
[38:29.760 --> 38:35.760]  distinctions in any of their products yeah right there's no business iphone and business you know
[38:35.760 --> 38:41.600]  home iphone and in fact it's the fact that they didn't do that and they don't have any such
[38:41.600 --> 38:47.920]  distinctions is what's driven this whole you know i think revolutionary bring your own device to
[38:47.920 --> 38:54.800]  work thing you know that that's really gotten and you know gaining momentum in like the biggest and
[38:54.800 --> 39:01.120]  most buttoned up corporate environments yeah i really think i mean that that whole good better
[39:01.120 --> 39:09.280]  best thing that they did around 2000 right was that that's no i think it was even earlier okay
[39:09.280 --> 39:13.680]  so maybe it started earlier and it went like up to like 2003 or something like that and then they
[39:13.680 --> 39:19.200]  think they started dropping it um was brilliant and i think they should i frankly think they
[39:19.200 --> 39:26.240]  should still do that i think they do internally but it's it's a little bit blurrier you know it's
[39:28.800 --> 39:32.880]  well and the other thing they did was well they had good better and best but then
[39:32.880 --> 39:40.720]  they had just had the simple four-way product matrix of pro not pro portable not portable
[39:40.720 --> 39:47.600]  you know right and there was so there was the not pro portable was the ibook and the pro portable
[39:47.600 --> 39:55.760]  was the macbook or i guess it was powerbook then uh you know imac was the not pro desktop and the
[39:56.800 --> 40:02.800]  power mac power mac i was gonna say mac pro right power mac was the pro desktop and that was it and
[40:02.800 --> 40:07.760]  then within each one there was good better best yeah so it's a little bit more complicated now
[40:07.760 --> 40:12.080]  but not too much i don't think it's gonna be really calm i have no idea what they're gonna
[40:12.080 --> 40:17.840]  do next year with the iphone well shelf that that's because i think that that's a deep
[40:17.840 --> 40:23.760]  conversation it is a deep yeah um uh i think we should return to it but i don't think it's hard
[40:23.760 --> 40:29.280]  to go in and buy a macbook today i think you know you know it's what would you rather do would you
[40:29.280 --> 40:37.120]  rather you know pay i think it'll get more complex maybe more complex if the rumored retina macbook
[40:37.120 --> 40:42.800]  airs are coming as you know like in the early months of next year which i think is probably
[40:42.800 --> 40:49.840]  true i think if the imac has gone retina i think that the macbook air is probably next and i think
[40:49.840 --> 40:55.040]  suddenly suddenly that becomes a little tougher decision to make but that's a transition right
[40:55.040 --> 40:58.800]  and if anything it's only going to steer more people towards spending a little less
[40:58.800 --> 41:07.840]  and getting the retina macbook air instead of a retina macbook 13-inch macbook pro you know which
[41:07.840 --> 41:12.960]  i think would save people money instead of making people pay more right but it's still right now
[41:12.960 --> 41:18.160]  today though it's a very easy decision it's like do you want the really nice machine and yeah it's
[41:18.160 --> 41:24.000]  going to be a little thicker and heavier or do you want the cheaper lighter one which is the air yeah
[41:24.000 --> 41:31.040]  it was pretty easy i mean knowing the the getting my wife a machine was actually relatively simple
[41:31.040 --> 41:36.240]  because she's got a monitor she's got an external monitor so she didn't need a huge screen so
[41:36.240 --> 41:45.040]  10-inch and definitely the air obviously and then it was just storage space and she
[41:45.040 --> 41:52.000]  she's got a fairly big iphone library so she needed she couldn't take the 128 gig hard drive
[41:52.000 --> 41:57.040]  and i was you know i think okay if you want to get a machine now it really makes sense to get
[41:57.040 --> 42:04.000]  eight gigs of ram instead of four yeah and so that was it yeah that's it yeah there's no other
[42:04.000 --> 42:09.280]  no other really no really uh any other considerations whatsoever yeah and i'm not you know
[42:09.280 --> 42:13.600]  and i'm sure that on the flip side it's like what drive like this conversation of what how great it
[42:13.600 --> 42:20.400]  is that we don't have too many choices to make is exactly what drives pc sure pc fans not
[42:20.400 --> 42:25.840]  and they think that and android fans right well because i think they're the same people you know
[42:25.840 --> 42:31.840]  i think that you know the people who most like the fact that they can configure the can built
[42:31.840 --> 42:37.920]  can still build their own pcs for the desktop um you know are the sort of people who think it's
[42:37.920 --> 42:45.200]  wonderful that there are so many android phones to choose from yeah my thing was that i'm
[42:45.200 --> 42:50.480]  seriously thinking about like in the next couple of weeks probably like maybe like maybe like for
[42:50.480 --> 42:56.000]  the month of december to try you know i haven't done it in like two years is give android a shot
[42:56.000 --> 43:02.080]  and try living for two weeks with an android phone um and so i asked around i was waiting for the
[43:02.080 --> 43:06.720]  nexus 6 to ship which i almost certainly knew i wasn't going to want because it's so huge
[43:09.520 --> 43:13.280]  but it came out and the reviews came out yesterday and a lot of them are really really bad
[43:13.280 --> 43:20.000]  like josh topolsky's you know had pictures from it and he thinks the the camera is actually worse
[43:20.000 --> 43:25.120]  than last year's nexus 5 and both of them are way worse than the the iphone camera man low light
[43:25.760 --> 43:31.520]  it's a really shitty camera and that to me is a deal breaker right there right um but it's you
[43:31.520 --> 43:36.480]  know so my just basic question to twitter and to my twitter followers is okay let's say i want to
[43:36.480 --> 43:41.280]  give android lollipop you know the new 5.0 version of android which i do think
[43:41.280 --> 43:46.320]  from the outside not having used it looks like the first one first version of android ever that's
[43:46.320 --> 43:51.920]  pretty well designed right um so that's why i want to try it and i have no interest in trying
[43:51.920 --> 43:57.520]  android four point anything on any phone because i know that i don't like it i know i've used it
[43:57.520 --> 44:02.000]  i've spent enough time with android four devices that i know i don't like the design so it has to
[44:02.000 --> 44:08.720]  be 5.0 which which phone should i get and it's there's no clear like this is the best one to get
[44:08.720 --> 44:14.560]  this is the best one to get yeah yeah more or less it comes down to the two most popular answers
[44:14.560 --> 44:22.720]  were the nexus 5 which is the year-old nexus phone and the moto x moto x is more expensive
[44:22.720 --> 44:31.920]  though it'd be costing me like 500 bucks no ht no htc no because it htc's m8 which did get some
[44:31.920 --> 44:38.160]  votes and most of the people who who voted for it you know said it's easily the best build quality
[44:38.160 --> 44:44.400]  of any android phone but all htc has promised for the m8 is that it'll get lollipop within the next
[44:44.400 --> 44:55.520]  90 days which probably means 89 days from now yeah i i've talked about my nexus 7 on the show
[44:55.520 --> 45:00.960]  before and it's a it's the original one and so the other day i thought you know because lollipop
[45:00.960 --> 45:07.280]  just came out not that long ago i thought oh well maybe i can see if i can get lollipop on that
[45:07.280 --> 45:12.560]  device because it wasn't included in the in the beta program originally it was was the
[45:12.560 --> 45:17.680]  tried it back in the summer and it was not one of the devices that you could install the
[45:18.400 --> 45:25.280]  the early release on and and and still there is no release for that device and how old is that
[45:25.280 --> 45:32.320]  which was very confusing so that's when did that come out two years ago two and a half years ago
[45:32.320 --> 45:42.240]  i just want to say um yeah because it came out the summer before the ipad mini and
[45:44.560 --> 45:49.600]  it's just it's just a little odd to me that lollipop is quote out but it's not they haven't
[45:49.600 --> 45:53.840]  created and apparently they're going to create a build for it but they haven't done it yet
[45:53.840 --> 45:58.880]  no yeah they're not good at stuff like that and it's a you know it's from google it's a google
[45:58.880 --> 46:09.200]  right it's a google device they're not they're i my broad impression of google overall i was
[46:09.200 --> 46:15.920]  i forgot i was talking about this on twitter the other day but that it's like one of those adages
[46:15.920 --> 46:21.040]  and i know it's you know it's it's obviously not mathematically true but you know you know the
[46:21.040 --> 46:28.960]  first 90 of the effort takes half your time and the other 10 takes the other 90 of your time you
[46:28.960 --> 46:37.440]  know it's that last 10 always is is not really 10 it's really more like half of anything any big
[46:37.440 --> 46:45.760]  project um and google is really bad at it at going into that you know and to me that like that like
[46:45.760 --> 46:52.960]  the hard part and for all the gripes people have about you know uh like ios new versions of ios
[46:52.960 --> 47:00.640]  running poorly on the oldest supported phones you know or tab or ipads at least they do run and it's
[47:00.640 --> 47:07.440]  a lot more effort to make that happen than i think people give apple credit for it yeah and it's you
[47:07.440 --> 47:12.480]  know google just punts on all that usually i mean i'd see or with android pretty much every every
[47:12.480 --> 47:17.680]  year like they've never really had a release that has good support even for their nexus devices that
[47:17.680 --> 47:25.440]  are more than a year old yeah because it's hard it's really really hard and they just don't even
[47:25.440 --> 47:31.760]  try but the consensus seems to be that if i want the best like the state-of-the-art android
[47:31.760 --> 47:38.240]  experience today get a moto x the the new moto x because they kept the name the same year after year
[47:38.240 --> 47:45.680]  that's interesting i wouldn't have i wouldn't have thought that yeah and everybody seems to
[47:45.680 --> 47:49.920]  agree with it too like the consensus is it's the best build quality it's a good you know
[47:50.720 --> 48:00.000]  a competitive camera and um motorola's extension it's not just a pure you know like the way that
[48:00.000 --> 48:08.240]  the nexus has the pure google android experience like android 5.0 with nothing you know unadulterated
[48:08.240 --> 48:15.280]  that moto x's version is pretty close to stock and the only thing they really do is they add
[48:15.280 --> 48:19.680]  their own applications as system apps that you can't delete but they don't change the system
[48:19.680 --> 48:24.960]  itself you know like the notification center looks like the pure android notification center
[48:24.960 --> 48:31.600]  you know and stuff like that you know it's a lot more it's it's really really close to stock
[48:31.600 --> 48:38.320]  android with a few motorola sprinkles as opposed to the htc and and samsung way of sort of getting
[48:38.320 --> 48:45.280]  in at the system level and right creating right i would love to try xiaomi phone yeah i would too
[48:45.280 --> 48:49.680]  i don't know how you could get your hands on one of them yeah i don't either and i from what i've
[48:49.680 --> 48:54.320]  read i suspect that while it would be fun to use it's probably crappy enough that you write
[48:54.320 --> 48:58.480]  want it you wouldn't want to blow a couple hundred bucks on it because it's you know right but i'd
[48:58.480 --> 49:02.240]  love to see what the user experience i mean what the what the software is like yeah because it's
[49:02.240 --> 49:08.560]  substantially different from the look of it yeah very very custom yeah
[49:11.920 --> 49:15.840]  and i don't know what's gonna happen you know people keep talking about oh look out because
[49:15.840 --> 49:21.280]  xiaomi is going worldwide now and i don't know what's gonna happen if they come to the united
[49:21.280 --> 49:26.560]  states i don't think they could be legal yeah yeah i i don't think they ever will come to any i don't
[49:26.560 --> 49:31.840]  think they're ever going to come to a country with strong ip laws right i really don't and they're
[49:31.840 --> 49:38.000]  going to stick you know i think they can they can grow they have a lot of room to grow just staying
[49:38.000 --> 49:43.440]  in the asian countries where they are because the way that they operate in a way that they
[49:43.440 --> 49:49.120]  so shamelessly copy stuff that i just don't see how they're gonna i just don't see how they could
[49:49.120 --> 49:55.840]  do it yeah i wouldn't think that they wouldn't be there five minutes before they get right
[49:57.360 --> 50:04.160]  slapped with a suit yeah well and let's um uh come back when we come back let's talk about
[50:05.200 --> 50:09.600]  your thing before about the what apple will do with the iphone next year okay so remember that
[50:09.600 --> 50:16.640]  but i'm going to take a break here and thank our next sponsor our good friends at harry's harry's
[50:16.640 --> 50:23.440]  harry's makes uh really super high quality men's shaving products at extraordinary prices
[50:25.120 --> 50:31.360]  and they it's a special month this is november but it's uh in harry's world it's movember have
[50:31.360 --> 50:35.760]  you heard of this movember yeah so it's a little late now i have to get started but you know better
[50:35.760 --> 50:40.240]  late than never but the idea with movember is you you you're uh you do a full shave you shave your
[50:40.240 --> 50:48.560]  face and then for the rest of the month you just grow out your mustache and the idea is when you
[50:48.560 --> 50:56.480]  start to look goofy and people say something to you you mention movember and what it is is it's a
[50:56.480 --> 51:02.400]  you raise money for men's health issues you know things like uh getting your getting your colon
[51:02.400 --> 51:12.160]  checked and everything like that um so uh harry's dot com is the official razor partner of movember
[51:12.160 --> 51:17.280]  and they will be there for the entire hairy month um so whether or not you grow your mo
[51:18.400 --> 51:23.920]  with harry's you can get an amazing shave and do good by supporting movember's quest to fund
[51:23.920 --> 51:30.480]  research on important men's health issues uh totally worth checking out uh really good cause
[51:30.480 --> 51:37.680]  i mean who's opposed to men's health um i mean it's a great great cause um and again i've said
[51:37.680 --> 51:44.720]  this before harry's products are just amazingly amazingly high quality um really high quality
[51:44.720 --> 51:51.600]  handles high quality blades um i just to me that just says it all is that they don't they're not
[51:51.600 --> 51:58.080]  like like like white label blades that they put their brands on they bought their own razor blade
[51:58.080 --> 52:03.760]  factory in germany uh a factory that's been crafting razors you know and blades for uh
[52:03.760 --> 52:09.040]  almost a century they bought it and now they make their own and by cutting out that middleman that's
[52:09.040 --> 52:14.000]  that's the main way that they can offer really high quality stuff at a fraction of the price
[52:14.000 --> 52:19.440]  of drugstore brands and it's literally like even if you go to like amazon who is not known for
[52:19.440 --> 52:24.800]  being undercut on prices and you know compare the price of like harry's blades versus Gillette
[52:24.800 --> 52:30.080]  blades you know the equivalent number of blades on the thing it's about half the price really
[52:30.080 --> 52:36.480]  really great price um their starter shave set starts at just 15 bucks that includes the razor
[52:36.480 --> 52:44.480]  handle three blades and your choice of harry's shave cream or their new foaming shave gel um
[52:45.280 --> 52:50.720]  i i've only ever used the shave cream i like that stuff but uh i don't know what kind of shaver are
[52:50.720 --> 52:55.680]  you do you like the foaming i'm currently i'm actually yeah when i used to use a straight razor
[52:55.680 --> 53:01.280]  um i like the foaming stuff see i don't like the foaming stuff because i can't see i can't see
[53:01.280 --> 53:04.880]  what's going on but if you like the foaming stuff they've got that now too with their shave gel so
[53:04.880 --> 53:10.000]  you get to pick what you want uh i just think feels good on your face i think it's like it's a
[53:10.720 --> 53:15.600]  anyway you know whatever yeah to each his own yeah my dad always used the the foamy stuff
[53:15.600 --> 53:20.400]  so i don't know i like the the regular shave cream that doesn't really foam up um but anyway
[53:20.400 --> 53:26.640]  you get your pick and they also just released a new aftershave moisturizer they sent me some of
[53:26.640 --> 53:29.920]  that they just sent it i don't even ask for it but i guess because they sponsor the show they
[53:29.920 --> 53:34.720]  sent me some smells really good i like it uh really high quality stuff all of their stuff
[53:34.720 --> 53:39.680]  comes in the most amazing packaging it i've said this before it's like the type of packaging that
[53:39.680 --> 53:43.200]  the pack rat in me doesn't even want to throw away and it's like then i start thinking to myself
[53:43.200 --> 53:46.800]  well no don't you now you're going to be on the hoarder show because you're crazy you're keeping
[53:46.800 --> 53:51.840]  the box with your razor right you you're keeping the cardboard box that your razor blades came in
[53:51.840 --> 53:58.160]  because you like the fonts i mean seriously i have to like i have to like do like a double
[53:58.160 --> 54:03.360]  take and then i go to throw it in the trash can and it's like i can't all right throw it out
[54:03.360 --> 54:08.480]  but it's real that's how good the packaging is uh really great stuff if you haven't checked them out
[54:08.480 --> 54:13.360]  if you haven't checked them out what god for god's sake do it now while november is going on

[54:50.080 --> 54:54.240]  uh you know i've never i've been shaving my head for like a year and a half now
[54:54.240 --> 55:01.120]  yeah i've never shaved it with a blade like uh i've always used an electric
[55:01.120 --> 55:09.680]  but i should try it with uh i bet it's a really nice clean uh clean cut uh yeah i don't know how
[55:09.680 --> 55:14.160]  do you i don't know how you would know some people do it i know i mean i know bald guys who do it
[55:14.160 --> 55:19.760]  right but you can't see i don't know yeah i don't i'm gonna be careful i have a hard
[55:19.760 --> 55:27.520]  skill get hank to do it i have enough time i have enough uh i have enough trouble just shaving my
[55:27.520 --> 55:35.200]  face with my decreasing vision and stuff what i can look at is is hard enough uh so next year's
[55:35.200 --> 55:41.200]  iphones i a lot of people have been talking about this uh is what that what are they going to do
[55:41.200 --> 55:46.240]  with the four inch size is that what you're thinking yeah because i've seen a lot of a
[55:46.240 --> 55:52.160]  lot of people have been publishing their whatever like month a month with the iphone 6 plus or
[55:52.160 --> 55:57.760]  months with the iphone 6 um and everybody seems to really like them i like the device
[55:57.760 --> 56:04.000]  well enough i've got a six and but um but i mostly what i'd mostly like about it is the extra
[56:04.000 --> 56:11.520]  features as opposed to the larger screen if i could i would actually go back to the four inch
[56:11.520 --> 56:17.440]  i would too i in fact i did it for two weeks i went back just to see you know what i thought
[56:17.440 --> 56:24.240]  i actually took my sim card out and went back to my 5s for two full weeks and really liked it
[56:25.040 --> 56:32.400]  um but ultimately went back to the six because i can definitely tell i can absolutely pepsi
[56:32.400 --> 56:39.280]  challenge the the superior photos especially indoors it's possible that outdoors in sunlight
[56:39.280 --> 56:45.200]  i couldn't pepsi challenge the photos but indoors i can definitely do it there's so much less noise
[56:45.200 --> 56:54.080]  on the um and brighter brighter exposures in in really low light on the six that it's that alone
[56:54.080 --> 57:00.480]  almost makes it seals the deal um i also can tell and this is something i didn't like when i wrote
[57:00.480 --> 57:05.360]  my review of it that i didn't notice and it's the sort of thing that it's why i wish that i
[57:05.360 --> 57:09.600]  could always take six weeks to write these reviews like i used to before i got the review units as
[57:09.600 --> 57:14.400]  opposed to doing it in like one week but like in the first week with it the two new phones i did
[57:14.400 --> 57:18.640]  two new phones i i noticed that the screens were nice but i didn't notice that they were actually
[57:18.640 --> 57:26.400]  nicer than the 5s like yeah i didn't either uh and there's that whole that the the big thing that i
[57:26.400 --> 57:31.600]  was obsessed with the first week was the increase in pixels per inch on the six plus that they went
[57:31.600 --> 57:42.480]  to this uh 19 you know 20 by 1080 resolution and it runs at 3x a retina but on the fly they scale
[57:42.480 --> 57:49.520]  down to like this weird 2.7 x scaling factor and i spent the whole week like you know taking my
[57:49.520 --> 57:53.440]  glasses on taking them off getting it you know squinting real close at it's trying to see if i
[57:53.440 --> 57:59.040]  could see you know the scaling and how much nicer and it really the six plus really does look nicer
[57:59.040 --> 58:02.800]  to me like you get really close to it and text looks better because there's more pixels per
[58:02.800 --> 58:07.680]  inch even though they're scaling and it's not true 3x it really does look better than 2x and
[58:07.680 --> 58:15.120]  the regular six has the same 326 pixels per inch as the 5s i didn't notice this in the first week
[58:15.120 --> 58:19.040]  with the phone because i was obsessed with just the pixels per inch and the six had the same
[58:19.040 --> 58:24.240]  pixels prints for the 5s so i didn't really bother looking at it too much but now lo these
[58:24.240 --> 58:31.280]  almost what two months later and with me having gone back to the 5s for two weeks uh and now back
[58:31.280 --> 58:37.120]  to the six i can really notice that the six you know the fact that it has the same pixels per
[58:37.120 --> 58:43.360]  inch aside is so much as a really nice improvement to the screen and it i know that they talked about
[58:43.360 --> 58:48.080]  the fact that they added a polarizing filter or a new polarizing filter so it looks better with
[58:48.640 --> 58:55.600]  polarized sunglasses but i think something to do with that also the the the screen is even closer
[58:55.600 --> 59:01.600]  to the glass than before it's even you know i know that i raved about it endlessly when they
[59:01.600 --> 59:06.960]  first went retina with the iphone 4 that it really looked like the the pixels are closer to the glass
[59:06.960 --> 59:12.400]  but now it's so much closer that it makes like my iphone 5 look like the screen is too far behind
[59:12.400 --> 59:17.120]  the glass and it even makes all of my ipads everything i look at other than the phone look
[59:17.120 --> 59:23.840]  like the pixels are too too too far under the glass and that's really nice um but bottom line
[59:23.840 --> 59:29.360]  is it's all about the feel in my hand and i like the four inch feel in my hand better i do i use my
[59:29.360 --> 59:34.880]  phone so much of the time that i use my phone i really only have one hand uh it writes it's just
[59:34.880 --> 59:41.360]  humongous it's a humongous issue for me yeah i can i can't bring myself to to get into reachability
[59:41.920 --> 59:47.120]  i do you use reachability never much you know even though i even though my complaint is about
[59:47.120 --> 59:53.280]  not being able to reach stuff at the top with my grip it never occurs to me so instead i'm doing
[59:53.280 --> 59:58.640]  this thing where i'm gently palming it right and i have no there's no support at the bottom and i'm
[59:58.640 --> 01:00:02.720]  reaching across the phone to get to the upper right hand corner i'm doing it right now which
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:07.600]  is why my mouth is turning away from the microphone but um and i just i know i'm going to drop it at
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:13.680]  some point because it's not a it's not a secure hold but reachability i mean to me it's nice that
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:20.880]  it's there but it it doesn't it often doesn't fire for me on the first try and so then i'm you know
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:25.200]  i'm doing this extra thing that i didn't used to have to do and sometimes it's not working
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:34.000]  and it just doesn't it's not it's not solving the problem for me definitely it just never occurs to
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:42.160]  me to use it it's it's part of what i love about ios is even more than mac os 10 to me the system
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:48.960]  makes such a coherent sense the design of the way that you go in and out of apps and navigate
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:54.480]  within an app it's like i'm in i'm just whenever i'm using my iphone i'm just in a certain mental
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:01:00.960]  zone and it using reachability takes me out of that you know because it's not on screen like
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:09.280]  part of what to me the magic of ios is that everything is on the screen anything you can do
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:17.280]  is something you can see on the screen and it that's a profound decrease in
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:25.520]  abstraction like that's why i think that the like the hardware back button that android uses even
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:30.880]  though they draw it on screen now you know on most phones but the fact that it's outside the
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:36.800]  rules of the system it it just never occurs to me to use it when i'm using android and yeah i find
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:40.880]  it hard to remember that that's what you're supposed to do you know that the only thing you
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:48.320]  ever have to do in ios that's that's hardware related is hit the home button software wise you
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:52.800]  know and then there's things like volume but that volume makes sense that it's hardware because it's
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:56.320]  it's not the software you're manipulating it's what they actually you know it makes sense that
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:02.640]  it's hardware because it's the device that's emitting the sound and using reachability just
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:09.440]  takes me outside that zone it feels like it's it's not on the screen right and it's not on the
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:16.480]  screen right you know if if if somehow i could just swipe my thumb down and the phone would
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:20.800]  magically know that i'm swiping down to read something i'd probably use it all the time
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:24.480]  but there's of course no way the phone could read your mind and know that you're swiping down for
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:31.600]  reachability as opposed to some other thing yeah yeah you know it's if it could though read your
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:36.880]  mind in theory you know no i mean i know that i'm just saying i would use it all the time i would
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:42.560]  just drag the screen down and you know hit the hit the back button but it's a big issue for me
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:51.200]  i also i really really don't like the size of it in my jeans and i keep that i don't notice actually
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:55.600]  i really don't notice the difference there i definitely do i think part of it too is that
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:00.400]  when i wrote my review in september i was it was still somewhat shorts weather i might have spent
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:07.840]  more time with shorts i don't know but it's uh i and i keep uh i keep toggling the mute switch
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:16.720]  as i take it in and out of my jeans i also i just don't like it i even like the flat sides of the
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:22.720]  iphone 5s i kind of like that but i also kind of like the new one too i mean i love the feel
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:28.880]  it's i like the smooth feel too i'll i'll chalk that one up to a a wash because if the if there
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:37.360]  were in theory a 4.0 inch iphone 6 that had this shape i wouldn't be complaining about it i guess
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.840]  yeah i wouldn't either uh but i do think my thing is that i noticed after switching back to the 5s
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:51.840]  for two weeks that it the flat sides make for a nicer iphone as camera oh yeah holding it to take
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:57.360]  a picture it feels more natural in my hands to have my fingers pinching flat sides than round
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:02.480]  sides yeah um but i'll call that a wash it's overall though how easy it is to reach everything
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:07.360]  with holding the phone in one hand and how big it is in my pocket yeah i mean sometimes it's
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:17.200]  i mean like so so uh our friend nevin mergen's game came out last night space age and i downloaded
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:24.800]  that and and you know it's nice having a larger screen to play a game but i don't think to me
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:30.880]  it's not enough it's not you know i have an ipad it's not nice enough on the phone to make the
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:36.560]  difference for me yeah no no question when you're using it it's you know there are certainly reasons
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:42.800]  to to prefer a bigger screen i mean i i i watch most most of the in the summer when i'm when
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:47.680]  baseball season's in and i watch uh seriously i watch you know i don't know over 100 yankee games
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:53.520]  a year the ones i don't watch on tv i usually watch on my ipad but i wind up just for convenience
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:58.480]  sake sometimes watching them on my phone and obviously watching something that's the equivalent
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:03.120]  of tv like a ball game the bigger the screen the better you know right even the six plus is better
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:08.880]  you know but that's to me isn't important enough to optimize which phone i get
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:17.520]  if there were a 4.0 inch iphone 6 like a third size zero hesitation 100 certainty that's the
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:22.400]  one i would have bought yeah me too well i think i mean at this at this point i wanted to try it
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:26.880]  try the bigger size and see if i liked it better but i've come to the conclusion that i don't
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:32.640]  all right it's not even it it would be it's an easier decision than almost any other in the apple
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:38.960]  product line and no hesitation i think the iphone 6 is i don't and i i here's the big here's the
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:44.720]  thing that i think gets lost in this is that people who love uh big phones and i know that
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:51.680]  they truly do there are people who love the five the six plus you know um for whatever reason
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:06:00.000]  for whatever reason they seem to as a group to lump them all together they seem to think just
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:05.200]  unilaterally big phones are better and you know now that now that the iphone has bigger screens
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:10.480]  iphone users will see what they've been missing out on two years everybody will see it and will
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:15.760]  get to you know will appreciate it i don't doubt that they're right but i i really do think though
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:21.600]  that there are you know i'm certain now having used it for this bunch and having gone back that
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:28.800]  you know it's the the scale of form factors that people want in phones definitely goes
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:37.520]  beneath 4.7 inches for you know so my my my short version is not that the iphone 6 is too big
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:45.200]  it's that it's too big to be the smallest iphone mm-hmm you know not that i not that i'm doubting
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:49.600]  that there are some people who love this size and that it's perfect for them so what are they going
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:07:00.320]  to do next year yeah i don't know well i would be surprised if they don't update the that that
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:08.160]  that the four inch form factor though what i hope they do is is expand the top of the line
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:16.240]  you know which would be next year i would expect an a9 system on a chip and you know an even better
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:22.080]  camera i would what i hope they do is expand to three sizes and that they you know whatever they
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:27.840]  call it you know yeah if it's me i don't know if they're going to stick with this thing where they
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:34.000]  you know use use the same you know if next year's 4.7 inch is exact same physical size as this and
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.760]  they call it the 6s and they call the other one the 6s plus and they fit the same cases
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:44.400]  and maybe they just update the colors of the metal to show that they're new ones
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:52.960]  and introduce i don't know an iphone 6 air call it the iphone 6 air and make it the four inch size
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:08:02.960]  um with like i said what i would hope for is they would have the a9 and the new camera and all that
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:08.880]  the apple pay but well i think it'll have apple pen no matter what what i think is more likely
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:17.520]  is that they would make it do it sort of like they did the 5c two years ago and that the four
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:23.760]  this is what i think is more likely that the four inch size there will be a new phone but it'll be
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:33.280]  like the 5c might be even might even be plastic right uh and would have the internal specs of
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:43.280]  these phones the a8 these 2014 instead of the nine yeah and the camera from this phone and
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:49.360]  it and it would be you know a hundred dollar lower starting price than the 6s yeah that sounds more
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:54.080]  likely to me i think it's way more likely because i think they have to like they can't price it
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:59.440]  equivalent they can't make yeah i think you know well the screen the screen size alone isn't enough
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:04.240]  for it to warrant a hundred dollar difference right you know that that's it would they be
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:10.960]  eating into their profit margins too much you know that you know they can't justify you know
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:15.040]  it wouldn't cost them a hundred dollars less to do it so i think it would be more likely that it
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:22.640]  would be like the 6c the iphone 6c and it would be four inches but it would be a year behind on the
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:27.120]  specs to me the plastic seems to belong at the bottom of the line though because what happens
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:32.640]  then i mean you can't you can't then take the 5s and move it down to the free model and have a
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:37.600]  plastic well maybe i guess you could but the screen size is the same i mean that's what they
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:46.720]  did with the five right you know they had the 4s when the 5c came out at the bottom yeah but that
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:53.040]  was a different screen size and it doesn't seem like they could push down i mean maybe they could
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:10:02.640]  just make a new kind of new 5c so then the bottom two would be both plastic yeah something like that
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:10.480]  i don't know but that's what i worry that they're going to do and then i worry that um on the cpu
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:20.960]  side i would i probably would just prefer size alone and i'll take the year-old cpu specs
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:29.120]  and get the smaller one but i'm very much worried that the camera in next year's iphone will be so
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:35.440]  much better again than this year's that yeah even though i'm so impressed this year with this camera
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:40.000]  i think next year's camera is going to be so much better that i won't that i'll be stuck getting
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:46.080]  the 4.7 inch one again for the camera even though i would take the a the year-old a8 because i don't
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:50.320]  really play a lot of games and stuff like that and it's you know i don't know that that getting an
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:11:00.480]  improved a9 would mean that much to me but the improved camera would yeah i mentioned this a few
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:06.400]  episodes ago but i and i don't have any firm thing about it but i heard like a rumor of a rumor from
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:12.320]  a like a birdie who knows a birdie like way distant but that well number one it's it's not
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:18.320]  looking at every single year the camera's gotten better on the iphone i think except for the first
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:26.960]  except for the 3g the the you know the 2008 iphone had the same camera as the original 2007 like still
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:33.760]  didn't shoot video still was really looked like a phone camera but ever since the 3gs every single
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:39.680]  year the iphone camera has gotten noticeably better like enough better that it was the camera
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:46.320]  alone was tempting to be the reason that you upgrade every single year at least if you care
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:51.360]  about photography and so there's no reason to think that's going to stop anyway but the the
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:56.720]  specific thing i heard is that there it's like next year's camera might be like the biggest
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:02.480]  camera jump ever that they've got like yeah really yeah that it's i don't even know i don't even know
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:06.960]  what sense this makes but that i've heard that it's it's some kind of weird two lens system where
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:14.480]  like the back camera uses two lenses and i don't know somehow that it it takes it up into slr
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:20.560]  quality imagery and i don't know that well and in some ways that and that's what i've heard but
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:27.760]  it it can't really mean slr quality because a lot of what makes slr or and and in the digital age
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:34.000]  the the four-thirds cameras which aren't slr but you know what i mean what it means is big sensor
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:41.280]  and a lot of what makes a big cameras with big sensors have better imagery is is physics you
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:45.760]  know there's physics involved and you have to really have to have the lenses right right but
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:50.080]  that there's something they could do with two lenses i don't know that just makes the photos
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:57.120]  if not at a technical level slr quality but at a practical level for consumers taking pictures
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:04.080]  you know closer to slrs i don't know but that it's a big enough jump that anybody who cares
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:08.880]  about the photography even if you really want a four-inch phone again you're going to get the
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:16.160]  4.7 yeah i feel like the last two cameras have been plenty of camera for me i'm not as big a
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:23.040]  camera buff as you are and for years it did seem like yeah okay okay i'm i'm basically taking
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:28.480]  pictures with this because it's the one that's in my pocket and i don't i don't feel like that
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:33.040]  anymore like it's it's practically speaking caught up to almost everything that i need
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:39.200]  yeah it's just they've gotten so good yeah it's i'm you know and i'm a guy who's you know every
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:43.440]  every couple of years not every year like every couple years i'll drop 800 or a thousand dollars
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:48.000]  yeah on a new camera i don't do that and i really do care about some of that stuff and i really i
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.480]  could just see looking at my you know like my lightroom archive that every year it's more and
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:14:02.240]  more or less and less photos shot with anything other than the iphone yeah it's it's it's it's
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:06.960]  it's you know it's always it just gets more and more even like on vacation and i have the camera
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:11.280]  camera camera with me and it's like i don't feel like walking around with that in my neck i'll just
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:16.880]  use my iPhone but i do i think i think the camera is what it's going to come down to for me next
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:22.800]  year unless they do what i really really hope they do is put you know put three phones at the top of
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:30.080]  the yeah that would be what i would hope to but i don't think they will i agree yeah but i still
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:35.680]  think i would probably like i would probably go back to you know stick with the relatively same
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:42.960]  internals as this phone in a four inch screen yeah i think it would i if the camera isn't vastly
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:49.360]  improved if it's you know i i would be very tempted just to get that phone i noticed too and
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:55.280]  here's the other anecdotal thing is like two or three weeks ago there was a little a small indie
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:15:02.160]  mac conference here in philly coco love um i didn't speak at it but i went to it and you know
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:10.560]  you know i don't know 150 you know mac nerds ios development um you know some friends marco was
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:15.920]  here dave dave whiskus and brent were here but you know met a lot of new people too i don't really
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:20.720]  get out much so even though even though even the local people a lot of them were new to me
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:26.640]  um and people noticed that was that was it it occurred during that two-week stretch where i
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:31.440]  went back to my 5s and a lot of people noticed that i was using a 5s and specifically you know
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:37.520]  and they asked and every almost every single person who i talked to about it was like nodding
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:42.720]  their head in agreement that yeah i've you know and they a lot they were all people who had the
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:48.560]  six not the six plus and all were thinking the same thing that i i love so much about this new
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:55.280]  phone except that it's bigger yeah so there's definitely and it's not just you and i are not
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:16:02.720]  outliers like we may not be the majority like the the the split across the product line may not be
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:07.280]  one third one third one third if they did this but i think that it's i think it's maybe close
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:11.600]  to at least a quarter of people would prefer the four inch size yeah i think so too i mean
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:17.120]  i've talked to i mean it seems like most of the people i talk to actually are you know so i've
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:24.320]  got a friend who who has giant oven-sized mitt hands and so he got a six plus and he feels like
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:29.760]  he's home because you know he had a four which was so he was like waiting you know thinking
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:33.840]  they're gonna make a new they're gonna make one that's bigger and i'm gonna wait for that and so
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:40.880]  he got the six plus when i came out and he's he's just like it's perfect for him but you know like
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:45.600]  our neighbor up the street was we were talking well before the phone these phones came out and
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:49.760]  she said she said it's gonna be bigger i don't even like i've got a four i don't even want a
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:56.880]  bigger phone than this you know my mom is on a 3gs and i keep saying when are you gonna get a
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:00.320]  new phone you need to get a new phone it's like she's not even getting software updates anymore
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:04.960]  and and then it was like okay well if i get one what are you gonna get what should i get
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:08.640]  on you like well i guess you should get the it's like i don't want to be i don't want a huge phone
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:15.840]  so i guess you should get the the 5s and and my wife same thing i was like she's like i don't
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:22.000]  want that big a phone i just don't want it that big so all the people i know who are in the market
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:29.280]  right now are not terribly excited about the larger form factor right i you know and i i think
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:37.200]  it's i i i think it's a complicated product marketing problem you know where i i i think
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:42.160]  part of it clearly there are people i've said i mean i know this that there are people who love
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:48.400]  like your big-handed friend who love the six plus and i know that there are people with tiny hands
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:52.560]  who love the six plus you know there are you know there and i know you know from talking to ben
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:18:00.880]  thompson huge every every woman in asia yeah has a big like phablet size six inch phone and they
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:06.640]  were all all of them who wanted an iphone were all waiting for the six plus and and you know it's
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:10.880]  almost like for some of the people like women with really small hands that they couldn't use the
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:15.440]  iphone 4 one-handed either so the whole one-handed thing wasn't an issue anyway so you might as well
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:19.760]  get a big one so i know that it's not just an issue it's not just appealing to people with
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:24.160]  large hands it's you know it's across the board some people just use their phone two-handed all
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:33.520]  the time and if so why not get the biggest one um but it's not just nerds either it's not just me
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:38.320]  like amy who uses her iphone very differently from me she's nowhere near she's not on it anywhere
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:43.760]  near as much as i am um but she she doesn't like the six size either she thinks it's ridiculously
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:48.160]  big and she can't even she really can't even believe that there's a bigger size
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:57.360]  it's pretty astounding when you see it for the first time yeah whoa that's a lot of phone it
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:02.160]  you know what and it's funny it's funny because i even had one as a review unit and i used it for
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:06.800]  a week but at the the coco love conference you know when everybody had an iphone everybody had
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.080]  them out all the time and there were people of course not just the people who you know who were
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:13.360]  nodding their head in agreement with me that the six is too big but there were of course other
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:19.040]  people who had the six plus and you see them with it it's like wow yeah it's a big ass phone yeah
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:24.240]  i don't know i'll never get over it yeah i got it i've got my four my old four sitting here
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:25.360]  and it just feels really good
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:32.240]  i do i love that small i just that feels like a phone to me yeah i had a good feel i like the
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:38.240]  five s too five s bottom line for me the five s is at this point peak iphone that it's actually
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:43.280]  to me overall right the overall you know like best iphone ever made to me is the finance yeah
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:48.480]  i agree i agree because the five was was the right form factor but it got dinged up badly it wasn't
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:54.800]  it wasn't as nice a build right hey let's take a another break here and thank
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:20:04.320]  another long time friend of the show our good friends at backblaze backblaze is unlimited
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:11.600]  unthrottled backup for your mac online backup you sign up for backblaze you get this software to
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:16.560]  install on your mac written by former engineers at apple and they're like oh my god this is
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:22.240]  back written by former engineers at apple really really good software nice interface easy to
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:28.240]  understand and runs very very quietly in the background doesn't you never know when it's on
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:35.760]  or not and what does it do it just backs up everything on your mac to their cloud servers
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:39.280]  and if you have external drives you think well it's only going to back up my my internal drive
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:44.560]  no backs up all of them and you think well but i've got a four terabyte drive it's never going
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:49.120]  to back up that what's the limit no it's unlimited now it might take a long time for that first backup
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:53.840]  four terabytes if you've filled up a drive four terabytes going up through you know the upstream
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:58.880]  and your internet might take a couple days might take over a week but once it's backed up everything
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:07.440]  after that is incremental and it just runs after that and then what what's on everything you have
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:15.680]  your computer is in their system and it's such a remarkable peace of mind to know that you've got
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:22.720]  a backup that's off site so if your house catches on fire and your home office burns up and your
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:26.800]  backup drive your time machine drive gets burned up along with your computer or your house gets
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:33.680]  burgled and somebody comes in and rips you off steals your stuff your stuff your data at least
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:40.480]  is still somewhere safe and you can do things like use their iphone app to access one file
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:45.440]  like you're away from your computer and you just want to get this one file you know it's on your
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:50.960]  computer you can use the backblaze app log in go to where that file is and send it to send an email
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:56.320]  with that as an attachment from your iphone from anywhere or if you want to access everything you
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:01.120]  want to you need a full restore your you didn't have any other backup your hard drive seized up
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:06.800]  you know the the disk utility can't fix it you're thinking oh my god my whole thing is busted
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.160]  you can go there and what you can do at a very low price just pretty much the cost of the hardware
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:17.360]  is you can have everything on your stuff put onto a usb hard drive and then they'll just mail it to
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:23.920]  you so like two three days later backblaze sends you a usb hard drive with a full restore of
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:29.200]  everything from your system and you've lost nothing can't say enough how great the service
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:38.080]  is i recommend it to everybody um uh you know what do they have here's the stats 100 petabytes
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:43.920]  of data backed up on their in their system and one petabyte is a thousand terabytes so that's
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:50.560]  how much they have overall from all their users no add-ons no gimmicks no additional charges
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:57.440]  it's just five bucks per month per computer so every mac you have you spend five bucks a month
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:04.160]  for each one and you have unlimited backup for it it's an unbelievable price risk-free no credit
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:10.800]  card required for the trial just go here go back blaze.com slash daring fireball back blaze.com
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:14.960]  slash daring fireball and sign up and they'll know you came from the show if you haven't done
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:19.680]  it yet honestly i this is the one sponsor above all others that i i almost wish that they would
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:24.160]  stop sponsoring because everybody who listens to the show would just sign up for it and but
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:27.680]  apparently every time they sponsor the show more and more people sign up but i don't know who you
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:34.080]  are who haven't signed up yet but do it because i don't want you to lose your data can't recommend
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:42.080]  them strongly enough all right what else is going on let's talk about your book oh talk about your
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:46.480]  book yeah we can take or what you got something no that's fine we were talking about uh i was
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:51.360]  talking about having to use word yeah and that's what that's what i've used i was going to ask
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:55.040]  i was going to ask about that well here so here's the deal you've have you ever written a book
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:24:01.920]  before no so you've written your first book we're part of my first but it's a co-authored so it's
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:10.560]  it's myself and two other uh fine authors james clark and cory dustman and we have written the
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:18.960]  visual guide to minecraft for peach pit press our good friends at peach press and it's a
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:23.440]  getting started book for for people who are interested in getting into minecraft or interested
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:31.600]  in learning a little bit more about some things like how to build houses how to use redstone
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:37.680]  redstone is really kind of an amazing thing if you haven't gotten into redstone and in minecraft and
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:41.120]  there's a there's a good section on how to use redstone you're laughing because i'm laughing
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:46.560]  because i don't know what it means i think i think redstone is the stuff that i jonas called me over
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:51.520]  i jonas called me over one day and he said here watch this and he had a thing and he pulled a
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:58.480]  lever and then like a fuse left let off and like a fuse burned and then he had like a firework show
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:02.960]  ready to go and he you know yeah that was probably there was probably some redstone yeah anything
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:07.840]  using a lever is probably yeah probably redstone i mean in the great the cool thing about redstone
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:13.680]  is it it kind of teaches particularly for kids teaches it's like it's almost like programming
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:19.200]  because they're they're gates so you can set up a series of different gates and by using these gates
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:26.160]  you're basically using it's basically the same fundamental theory that is inside every computer
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:32.320]  all right it's logic right like you know ands and ors and stuff like that yeah and you know and one
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:38.960]  day kank came to me he's like i you know i saw this thing on you know as usual on youtube and
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:45.680]  somebody had made a an elevator in minecraft using redstone and he's like i want to make this thing
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:52.080]  but i can't figure out because you know most of these youtube videos are created by a lot of them
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:59.280]  are created by like 14 year olds or you know right people who don't necessarily have the best
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:05.280]  video production skills and uh and presentation skills and this guy was better than than most but
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:08.960]  he also got like halfway through and realized that he had screwed something up and just like tried to
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:16.240]  correct it on the fly so it was pretty aggravating for me having to put that thing together but we
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:22.320]  got through it we got it done anyway so some of that stuff is in the is in the book my section is
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:28.400]  that i got i got the beginning section which is uh how to you know basic game installation and
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:35.440]  using the interface and then also surviving surviving your first day which if your first you
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:39.760]  know that for me that was like the the hard part getting into the game was like okay you just get
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:44.560]  dropped in this world and there are no instructions really whatsoever and it's like so what am i
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:50.800]  supposed to do how do i how do i move around here what am i what's my what's my goal here and so i
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:56.880]  talk about that and then do some basic introduction and like and how to set up a server i did that
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:02.960]  i did that section and how to install mods so now your section is also available as its own
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:07.840]  standalone book yeah all of the section yeah all of them are so you know if you if you go
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:12.160]  so you can go to peach pit press and and it's peachpit.com and look at look up the visual
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:19.120]  guide to minecraft and you can get any of the sections separately as as ebooks or you can get
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:25.200]  the book and we're also we're also doing some video stuff that goes along with that so you
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:31.280]  buy the book you'll get access to that once it's available it's not quite up yet so that's why you
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:37.440]  bad mouth the 14 year olds who make the youtube videos is yours you're saying you're saying that
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:43.200]  the videos that accompany the visual guide to minecraft are are they don't get halfway through
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:47.120]  and realize that they hadn't set up the right yeah at the bottom of the elevator that's right
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:53.680]  that's right in fact they made me do over some of the videos that i did it's a good sign which
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:58.320]  is an interesting which was a and so we talked about like computer performance like gaming
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:07.840]  performance on laptops and so i have my my regular machine is a 2012 10 inch 11 inch whatever it is
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:14.320]  air with four megabytes of ram or megabytes yeah four megabytes of ram it's a special order
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:21.840]  four gigs of ram it's a 1991 commemorative macbook air what were those little things
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:31.040]  that you could dock into the oh yeah anyway and i had done some screen capture stuff before
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:36.400]  i thought okay that's there won't be a problem but when you're but it's one thing to do like
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:41.760]  screen capture stuff of just like web browsing or moving files around in the finder when you're
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:46.240]  playing a game and you're also running screen capture you know like a fairly processor intensive
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:52.480]  game like minecraft and also trying to run screen capture software it's a problem so the fan was
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:58.160]  going things were slowing down and it was it was not working right so i actually had to get hanks
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:05.760]  macbook pro uh has eight gigs of ram in it that was the that was the most powerful the most ram
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:10.480]  that we had in the house so i had to borrow hanks hanks macbook pro to actually do the video
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:18.880]  production for this thing how did you get started on this like how did who who whose idea was it to
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:23.760]  write this book so basic idea though is that a dummy like me who's been blabbering on this show
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:28.240]  for months now about being not understanding what the hell minecraft is this is i i've just started
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:32.400]  the book i got it last night but it seems to me like at the very least it's going to answer the
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:37.680]  basic question of what the hell is going on right right which is really what i want so i cannot tell
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:43.280]  you how happy i am that this book exists i i honestly i i'm this is like the the book of the
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:52.160]  year for me because i it it is a major part of my life this game because you know i love my son and
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:56.720]  i'm really parents uh yeah and i'm really it's like the first time he's really gotten into
[01:29:56.720 --> 01:30:03.280]  something um computer like he's more into minecraft than anything else he's ever been into
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:08.640]  and so i want to be a part of that and i almost feel like i feel like i'm the dad who never played
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:12.960]  sports and my kid wants to play baseball and now you're telling me that you've got to run around
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:18.400]  these ba i don't even understand you know that's how i feel about minecraft yeah yeah like the dad
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:22.640]  who grew up in england and therefore never never heard of baseball you know and now i live in the
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:26.640]  united states and my kid wants to play baseball right right right yeah so how did you how did
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:31.440]  you get involved with this so well he i mean he so he had he's got a buddy who got him into minecraft
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:35.920]  you know just like oh you gotta play minecraft play minecraft so um so he started playing
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:41.520]  minecraft like a couple of years ago now i think and you know and i same thing i just like watched
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:46.400]  it from afar and then thought oh yeah i should i should you know he was looking for someone else
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:50.000]  to play with and so i thought okay i'll i'll start playing but then i had that you know that
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:54.640]  reaction like that first like i don't know what the heck i'm doing so i actually watched a youtube
[01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:59.120]  video that said here's how to you know like what you should try and do on your first day
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:05.680]  and and then we played it for so he probably played it for at least a few months so i played
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:13.680]  it for like a year and a half or something like that and last spring i wrote that article for
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:22.240]  the magazine about right they the uh the basically the moguls of minecraft youtube world um about
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:30.320]  um about that guy stampy and diamond minecart and other people who are making ridiculous amounts of
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:36.640]  money doing these videos these let's play videos of minecraft on youtube who's the guy who's trying
[01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:42.000]  to get to the edge of the universe i don't know i don't remember that guy's name right um but yeah
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:47.760]  it's just like there's just there's so many people who are making minecraft and some of these guys
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:55.440]  make make very good money doing it and just from the youtube just from the youtube yeah yeah the
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:32:02.560]  ads right so so that guy stampy uh trying to remember his name off the top of my head joseph
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:08.720]  joseph garrett um he the the financial times was trying to figure out how much he made
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:16.400]  and they estimated that he grosses between eighty thousand and eight hundred thousand
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:24.800]  dollars a month doing these videos and google takes a cut of that they take like 45 percent
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:31.600]  and then his network that he works with that does promotion for him takes a cut of that so he's not
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:37.040]  he's not netting that right but still but his operation it as an operation though heading
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:41.440]  between thirty thousand and three hundred thousand dollars a month boy i can't believe google takes
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:46.560]  that much yeah apparently i guess i can yeah i mean there's something like that yeah i may not
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:52.080]  i may not have the exact number but it's it's in that range i don't know 30 seems like the
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:58.080]  gentleman's cap yeah you know like right you know i mean like everybody can complain that apple takes
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:03.440]  30 and i know amazon has some things where they take 30 it just seems like 30 is the gentleman's
[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:09.840]  cap for uh you know slicing off a top of every dollar that comes through your corporate thing
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:18.080]  anything more than that seems a little outrageous yeah but anyway keep going uh so uh cliff colby
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:24.480]  who is a guy who works at um peach pit and i have i've known him for years and we talked years that
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:28.240]  when i was writing crazy upper rumors we talked about like doing a book but i could never get my
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:32.160]  act together and i couldn't figure out what the heck to write and so cliff saw that article and
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:37.200]  he's like hey you know i think we should do a minecraft book and and uh get some other people
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:45.040]  to do some different sections and be relatively easy to put together so let's do it so he so when
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:51.120]  we talked to wwdc when i was down there in san francisco san francisco which is where they're
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:57.760]  where peach pit is based and basically wrote it over the summer and into the fall
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:02.960]  and then did the video production how big how big is your section
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:13.760]  uh i think my section's about 40 plus pages 40 to 50 pages something like that so it's not not huge
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:20.400]  no no it's not huge right but it takes time oh so it's an interesting it's an interesting process
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:26.080]  and all of it you know all of it in word which is not my i would that's one of the questions
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:32.000]  strength anymore i mean i used to be okay at it but it you know they they do these people
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:39.280]  the book production companies they they really they're all in on word yeah it's not just
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:45.360]  well we need we just all need to agree on a file format that we all can read it's because they're
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:50.160]  like the change tracking yeah it's mostly i think the probably the biggest thing is the
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:56.720]  change tracking and then after that it's formatting stuff i don't because they have all
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:04.080]  these so they have all their um their templates built into word already so they provided me a
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:12.000]  template and i typed into the template and then you know i would use they have macros that would
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:21.600]  do formatting stuff so yeah it's an i mean that part i'm curious but i'm curious because i am a
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:29.040]  writer i have written a lot i think i i think i i did a word count i exported everything from
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:34.320]  daring fireball before xoxo i didn't actually include this in my talk but because my talk at
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:38.480]  xoxo was about what it's like to have written during fireball you know how i built it into
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:43.680]  a business and you know the last 12 years or whatever um but i was curious because jim kudol
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:47.200]  asked me a couple months ago he was like what did how much have you written it during fireball and
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:51.760]  i'd never counted before so i wrote a script i exported everything from the link list and from
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:57.440]  my articles and then i wrote a script that cut out all the block quoted material so the block
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:04.400]  quotes didn't count right and it was remarkably even it was a little bit over 900 000 words for
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:12.800]  both link list entries and my like column length entries um so it's you know close to looks like
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:18.480]  maybe like within the next year i'll cross like the two million words mark which sounds like a
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:24.560]  lot of words that's a lot of that is a lot of words it really does it's not there's no sounds
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:30.640]  sounds like about it right and the basic i i've googled this many times but the you know books
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:35.520]  obviously vary great with greatly in length but like the typical length of a book is somewhere
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:42.160]  around like 60 to 80 000 words you know for like a novel or something like that um so it's you know
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:47.520]  like the equivalent of a lot of books yeah but on the other hand but i've never written i've never
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:52.800]  written anything in my life that's more than maybe four thousand words and i don't know that i can
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:56.640]  like i eat when i was younger i used to think well eventually you'll have to write a book
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:00.240]  because that's if you want to be a writer ultimately you think you gotta you gotta write a
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:06.160]  book um but you know i don't know i'm getting pretty old and i haven't written a book it's
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:10.800]  really just i mean particularly for something like this it's it's just a it's like you're writing a
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:16.240]  series of articles you know i wrote different i wrote a number of different sections about
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:22.480]  different topics and so each one was its own little thing i also think though and i don't
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:26.560]  want to be too much like the princess and the pea but i don't know that i could bring myself to
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:34.640]  working with word i really don't that was really and that sounds so my struggles with my hardware
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:40.720]  over the video production part which is really just my own fault uh the the word part is was not
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:46.880]  my favorite i you know i'm so picky about what i write that i invented a thing that people use i
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:51.120]  invented markdown specifically because i wasn't happy with what happened before that you know i
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:56.240]  can't imagine writing anything long form not in markdown and it seems like writing in markdown and
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:38:02.160]  then going and you know moving it into word would be such a huge pain in the ass it is i tried that
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:07.360]  at first and then because once you do it it's not working right and it doesn't work because uh
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:15.680]  once you have to make edits you can't go back right because that's actually you know like to
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:21.440]  go back 10 years because i think i think we're i think this fall is the 10-year anniversary of
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:27.520]  markdown 1.0 but the public beta came out like in february so we're past 10 years of like public
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:38.000]  markdown um but before markdown was marked down it it was um it was a series of filters i had in
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:45.920]  bbedit that were like one way like i would start by writing markdown like a a very prototypical
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:51.120]  early version of markdown that was mostly just like automatically putting paragraph tags in
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:58.240]  between blank lines and you know asterisks for italics and some kind of shorthand for links
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:04.000]  so i would write that way and then i would run my you know i didn't even have a name for it
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.720]  but i would run the script and it would turn it into html and then i would copy and paste
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:16.160]  the html into movable type but that grew it didn't last long because i would think i was
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:20.320]  done with the article but then it's like no i'm not really i have thought of something new and i
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:24.880]  want to go back but it's too late because now it's already in html and i'm stuck writing html which
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:29.120]  is the whole reason i started writing the script in the first place to let me use asterisks and
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:33.440]  stuff like that and it would be even worse i think it would be even worse to do it with something
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:39.680]  that's rich text like like uh yeah word yeah and i know there are probably i think there are there
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:45.280]  are some tools out there that try and help you with that process but uh you know i just i gave
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:53.120]  up and went ahead and i saw i actually started writing in bb edit with markdown right and then
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:57.840]  when i got to the point where i went i went to move the first section into word i was like okay
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:04.560]  this is not going to work at all no i mean but if you wrote your own book you wouldn't yeah and you
[01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:10.320]  don't have to use right right i don't have to you know go to someone like peachpet and yeah use their
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:13.920]  existing process i mean i'm sure that there's obviously a way that i could i could just self
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:17.440]  publish my own book at this point and i can do pretty well but i mean i would be surprised if
[01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:23.360]  david sparks actually writes in word uh yeah i should yeah you know what be the guy to talk to
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:32.080]  it would actually almost be uh hypocritical since like he's you know he's written a really really
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:36.560]  good markdown book yeah it would be kind of hypocritical if he hadn't written it in markdown
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:44.720]  and plus he i think he uses iBooks author right he has recently um so what would be the point i
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:48.400]  should find there'd be no there would be no point going to word i wouldn't even be surprised i did
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:52.560]  read his book and it's excellent i'll put a link to david sparks markdown book in the show notes
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:58.560]  but uh i'm trying to bulk up the show notes and i've noticed that a lot of the podcasts i like
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:04.080]  have these copious show notes that are you know just my links that's my value add to the two
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:09.600]  podcasts that i'm on and i i suffer from podcast amnesia as soon as i'm done recording a podcast
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:13.520]  i don't even remember what the hell we talked about well i have to listen to it again see
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:19.360]  that's the only way the only way i can do it all right um but anyway i'll try put a link to it but
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:23.040]  i wouldn't even be surprised i did read his book but maybe i i have vague recollection that maybe
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:30.080]  he even included something about how he wrote the book you know that his production yeah you know
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:35.920]  yeah and the other person who might know is serenity caldwell yeah she's very very well
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:42.880]  versed and i'd i'd public yeah i think she knows more about ebook into notes than uh anybody i
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:46.960]  love if there's anybody who knows more than serenity i'd like to meet them yeah i remember her
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:53.440]  her singleton talk from two years ago about the the nitty-gritty details of trying to write trying
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:42:03.200]  to create an ebook just for like just for like uh uh e-pub and kindle's mobi and it was like
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:07.840]  oh my god what a nightmare yeah like if you thought it was bad back in the days when you
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:13.680]  had this special case internet explorer and netscape it's like imagine if one uses html and
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:23.840]  one doesn't even use html it's really bad uh so anyway anyway now you use word right well my well
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:31.680]  my uh i've i've used word my my license has now lapsed since i'm since i'm done writing i don't
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:35.600]  even know i don't even know what it's later i'll get the license again but i don't even know what
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:40.320]  word looks like these days is it is it the case does everybody peach pit use max does it matter
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:48.480]  is it is it is like word at a state i don't think they all use max um i don't uh we work so the two
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:54.240]  people that i worked with at peach pit were cliff who um was really basically putting the deal
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:58.720]  together um you know bringing the people together and then we had sort of a project manager who i
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:05.440]  think uh is actually not a peach pit you know employee um someone that they contract with so
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:10.240]  and i'm pretty sure she did not use a mac but i think cliff definitely uses a mac
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:17.440]  so i don't know i think it's i think they're probably i bet it's a mixed environment
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:22.960]  i think i would think that most of the i don't know i don't know actually um
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:31.680]  it seems like a lot of this stuff must end up going to adobe at some point right uh i would
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:35.920]  guess yeah i would guess that the book is actually probably actually laid out with indesign yeah at
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:42.400]  least the print book right i don't know it just seems it's i don't know but the other you know
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:46.880]  the other thing i'll mention while we're promoting uh you know the book if you go to peach pit to buy
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:55.680]  your book they have a really sweet deal where you can get the print version yeah and a package of
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:44:03.440]  ebooks um e-pub which works in iBooks mobi which will work on any of your kindles you know either
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:10.240]  your app or your uh your actual kindle device and a pdf you know uh and they're they're not like
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:14.640]  drm or anything like that they just put a watermark on it that you know is registered to your name so
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:19.840]  that you know if you share it you would be you wouldn't be tempted to share it publicly publicly
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:29.120]  shamed right and well probably taken to prison um but which is to me the the best way to do ebooks
[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:32.560]  you know and i know there's other companies like o'reilly that do that and i know that our friends
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:37.840]  that uh uh take control the tidbits folks you know that they they send their you know their
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:42.720]  books are all cross-platform and and no drm and stuff like that but that's the best deal in my
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:52.320]  opinion 2159 21.59 and you get it all yeah which is a really good deal yeah and just to be clear
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:57.280]  while we wrap it up that when you go if you go to like the iBook store and search for molt minecraft
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:01.920]  two books show up no i swear i'm not i'm trying to help you out here i'm trying to promote you
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:07.200]  you search for molt minecraft two books show up and one's more expensive than the other
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:11.280]  that's because the one that's more expensive is the one with all three of your contributions and
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:17.040]  don't buy both because your book is just the introduction section of the yes so my my my
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:21.920]  section is the first section of the whole book right right uh let's take a break i have one more
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:27.920]  sponsor to thank yeah um and then we'll wrap up the show but uh i want to say thanks to our next
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:35.520]  sponsor and it's our good friends at igloo igloo is an intranet you'll actually like that's their
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:38.880]  slogan i say it's the intranet you'll actually like because i've never heard of another one
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:46.240]  um it's built with easy to use apps like shared calendars twitter like micro blogs file sharing
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:52.320]  task management and more it's everything you need for a team to work together better in one very
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:58.400]  configurable cloud platform um they have a great mobile story their mobile responsive design
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:05.680]  works like a champ on virtually any device any device with a webkit browser like android ios
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:13.760]  um even the new blackberries um windows phone they don't have webkit but you know the the
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:18.800]  mobile internet explorer is really pretty good on windows phone um responsive design on all
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:24.400]  those devices uh works on your new plus-sized iphone right from the start because that's
[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:30.720]  to me one of the little ironies of of the whole bigger iphone screen thing is that well-designed
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:36.480]  responsive mobile apps supported the new sizes automatically and then didn't have to be redesigned
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:43.600]  like like native apps did um you can review documents post project updates change administrative
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:50.400]  settings um you can even complain about the u2 album on your itunes library all from your phone
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:56.480]  from your phone you don't have to be at a pc and using a full-screen browser all of that stuff
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:00.960]  works from your phone um here's the other thing they want me to talk about and again i mentioned
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:04.720]  this the last time they sponsored the show i don't i don't really know much about the enterprise i've
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:11.040]  never worked in the enterprise but this is a big deal this gartner magic quadrant report um just
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:17.280]  earlier this month uh gartner released their 2014 edition of this and it's um their magic quadrant
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:21.760]  for social software in the workplace and this is a big deal for the corporate environments
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:29.440]  um for the sixth consecutive year igloo was listed uh alongside right alongside tech giants like
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:36.880]  microsoft ibm google vmware salesforce and sap all these big companies you know these big huge
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:41.840]  conglomerate type companies like salesforce and sap right alongside them is our little friends
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:48.480]  at igloo um because their their product stands right up with those guys really does um so the
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:55.680]  gartner report values things like the size of the vendor uh gartner calls that viability and igloo
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:48:00.640]  is praised by gartner for their responsiveness and customer experience here's an excerpt right
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:06.960]  from gartner's profile they said feedback from igloo's reference customers was consistently
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:12.720]  positive they praised the product's quick deployment configuration and customization flexibility
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:18.880]  with self-service options for non-technical users control over branding and information
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:24.640]  organization and ease of use they also praised the responsiveness of igloo as an organization
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:31.840]  so more or less bottom line that's that's gartner verifying and vouching for exactly what uh
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:36.640]  what i've been telling you about igloo all along ever since igloo became a daring fireball sponsor
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:42.160]  it's easy to use it's easy to understand it's easy for non-technical people to set up like the person
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:48.640]  in charge of the igloo uh intranet for your team doesn't have to be a web programmer doesn't have
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:53.760]  to be a system administrator it's just someone who can figure out a really easy to use visual
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:59.600]  interface for doing this uh really really great product i they're they're growing like gangbusters
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:05.680]  because it is so much easier and it really is uh it's the sort of internet that you'll actually use
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:10.160]  you know all their competitors the stuff like from microsoft sharepoint all that crap people
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:14.080]  if your team uses that it's like there's evidence that shows that what people on your team really
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:18.320]  do is they don't use it and they just pass everything around by email igloo is an internet
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:24.720]  that your team will actually use and best of all this to me is still amazing it's free to use
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:30.640]  in perpetuity with up to 10 people so if you have a 10 person or fewer team igloo is a free product
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:36.720]  you just use it for free and then after that you can pay at a very very competitive price per user
[01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:41.840]  after that so if you're a small team you can use it for free in perpetuity and if you're a bigger
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:48.240]  team you can start using it try using it see if everything i've said is true for free and then
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:55.520]  add people after that so where do you go to find out more easy go to www.igloosoftware.com slash
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:04.080]  the talk show all one word igloosoftware.com slash the talk show my thanks to igloo
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:11.600]  yeah as someone who has used corporate intranets igloo is is just slightly i mean i and i have used
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:17.520]  igloo as well just as a as a user on my own not within the corporate environment but it's such
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:22.560]  a dirty word that it's really like their whole marketing is just based on we know you hear
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:29.600]  internet and think big pile of crap we're we're not that that's like rewriting their marketing
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:34.240]  rewriting their marketing that yeah we know that when you hear that word you think oh god yeah
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:41.280]  here it goes it's just so it's so awful that so much corporate software is so bad and this is
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:45.680]  an instance where it's corporate software you know software that you can use in an enterprise
[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:55.520]  instance that is really good and a pleasure to use yeah speaking of writing long form writing
[01:50:55.520 --> 01:51:00.400]  and using markdown you know where where it's really taking off and i'm fascinated by it
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:07.040]  is with screenplay authors people who write movies oh there's there's two apps called
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:15.120]  one's called slugline the stew mash which is one of the people behind that and then there's highland
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:21.840]  which is from john august's app company highland i think started more as like a viewer
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:30.640]  that's uh john august's company is quote unquote apps they don't use markdown markdown they use they
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:36.880]  john and stew and a couple other people collaborated with like a tiny like like a
[01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:43.440]  one percent sprinkling of a little bit from me a couple years ago but they started with markdown
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:49.120]  and they instead made like a markdown like syntax they call fountain and it uses like the dot
[01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:56.560]  fountain file extension optimized specifically for the rules of screenplays like you know what
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:01.520]  a screenplay looks like yeah there's yeah it's kind of and years ago i used and i tinkered
[01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:07.040]  around with whatever that that heavy duty final cut not final cut final draft final draft yeah
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:12.400]  yeah and then you know and i've also used scrivener which has some screenplay stuff
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:18.000]  you know you can do you can do that in scrivener as well final draft is the microsoft word of
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:23.520]  screenplay writing it's the 800 pound gorilla on the market it is tons of features and the
[01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:31.200]  features help drive it and uh you know the file format is sort of a standard uh and people hate
[01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:35.520]  it or at least people take like for the read you know there's some people who love microsoft word
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:39.760]  i'm not saying again it's the same thing with the phone sizes i'm not saying that everybody
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:44.240]  hates microsoft word some people love it i'm sure you know there's people who just really get into
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:49.920]  it i'm sure there's people who love final draft but for the type of people who don't like word
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:55.920]  and who would prefer to write a blog post in a simple text editor with markdown right if you're
[01:52:55.920 --> 01:53:01.280]  like that you don't like writing your screenplay with final cut or final draft i keep saying final
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:06.480]  cut final draft and so instead um there's two of these apps that are great and that you know
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:09.760]  they're friends you know it's almost like a friendly competition because they collaborated
[01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:15.280]  on the file format this dot fountain uh file format between them but it's very very marked
[01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:22.240]  down like just with some assumptions based on the rules of uh screenplays so like the way that in
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:28.240]  the screenplay a character name for dialogue is always all caps so if you write uh in all caps
[01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:35.440]  molt's return that it automatically knows that that's uh a character name and that the next line
[01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:40.720]  is dialogue and you know if you want to put a word in italics you're wrapping an asterisks
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:46.640]  uh you know just like markdown but it lets you use if you want to you could just use something
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:52.080]  like bb edit and just write in a format that is very very readable in its native format and then
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:57.280]  you process it and out comes a pdf that looks like a screenplay everything's in courier
[01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:02.640]  all the margins are taken care of and stuff like that and but you could use their apps
[01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:07.760]  and you know the slug line and fountain and it format does you know as you're typing it looks
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:15.200]  a little bit more screenplay uh right off the bat instead of you know pure text but the file format
[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:19.840]  you're saving underneath is just plain text and then you know you have that peace of mind like
[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:23.440]  going back to our discussion about like the iworks apps like 20 years from now your screenplay is
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:28.160]  still just in a you know plain text file you don't have to worry that slug line is still an app
[01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:33.120]  you laugh but it's yeah no i know i know i'm laughing i'm still laughing about the i the
[01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:40.880]  iworks thing right uh and the other thing i think the reason that these apps have have taken off is
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:46.160]  even though final draft is still sort of a standard like it the basic gist though is like when you're
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:52.800]  if you're a working you know screenplay uh screenwriter the the canonical format that
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:58.000]  gets passed around as you submit your work and studios read it or you know even if you're already
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.800]  been hired and you have to pass a draft is a pdf file so it doesn't matter what you use to write
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:08.720]  it you generate a pdf and that's what everybody reads and these apps create pdfs that look like
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:13.520]  perfect screenplays there's no you know there is no system in place like with word with change
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:18.160]  tracking and stuff like that that you are obligated to use final draft in that way i mean maybe some
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:22.640]  studios have something like that but for the most part it seems like a lot of yeah you know working
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:30.320]  screenwriters can just use these apps and miss out on nothing and it pleases me to no end that that
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:35.760]  something i did you know with and with no almost like zero point zero zero zero zero one percent
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:40.560]  input for me that these guys went out and made something inspired by it that is you know really
[01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:46.080]  solves a problem for screenwriters that markdown solved for me as a somebody writing for a blog
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:53.760]  right i'll put do you uh do you have any uh well i probably you probably might not want to drop
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:56:00.240]  any names but i mean you know there's got to be some some famous people who are are using these
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:05.520]  apps well john august right i mean he made the app yeah i don't know i don't know of anybody
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:11.280]  bigger than that but you know john august writes you know blockbuster movies right right uh i don't
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:15.360]  know anybody uh you know of any other it'd be pretty cool to know though if you know which
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:22.240]  summer you know blockbuster movies were written right with these that'd be pretty awesome uh
[01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:27.360]  let me think about what else has been in the news uh you know what it's old news at this point but
[01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:33.680]  merlin and i didn't even mention it last week was uh tim cook coming out as gay yeah that was i
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:41.440]  guess it's about two weeks ago now but uh i thought that was so amazingly well done it's
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:49.200]  almost unbelievably how well how how how that played out yeah it's not i mean it's in it's
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:58.960]  i think i said on my website that it's nice for people who might be having trouble you know i
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:03.680]  mean a guy like tim cook is probably not really having trouble as a gate you know as much trouble
[01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:08.640]  as some other people are having as a gay gay people he probably did growing up though yeah
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:13.600]  because of the south well i even just leave the south out of it but he's a little bit older
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:19.360]  than me he's i guess he's probably about your age right isn't he around 50 i don't know how old he
[01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:23.440]  is yeah something he seems like that maybe a little bit maybe slightly older all right
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:30.400]  if only there was some way that we could look up how we could probably ask siri i wonder if she
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:43.680]  knows how old is tim cook let's see okay i found this on the web for how old is oh no immediate
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:53.200]  answer 54 54 years old yeah um you know i grew up in suburban philadelphia you know which is you
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:59.120]  know a little i think relatively speaking a little bit not certainly not socially super liberal but
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:05.040]  you know it's a little bit more liberal than the south and you know when i grew up it being gay
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:09.680]  was something that it just wasn't talked about really just wasn't i don't know when i was a kid
[01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:15.280]  it just i didn't really think it was i i sort of vaguely knew what it meant but it didn't seem like
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:20.960]  it was anybody you know it seemed like something that like maybe one in ten thousand people were
[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:25.600]  gay i don't know it just seemed very very it just seemed like something that must have been obscure
[01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:31.440]  because nobody talked about it yeah and i'm sure the adults knew that it was more common but it
[01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:37.120]  was something that it was basically not talked about and i think people you know it's like i
[01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:42.160]  think in that era people didn't talk about it with their kids because they didn't want to give the
[01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:48.400]  kid the the idea i guess it was the thought process i think i don't know don't say it in
[01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:51.920]  front of the kid because then the kid will become curious about what being gay is and the kid might
[01:58:51.920 --> 01:59:00.880]  become gay you know and combine it with you know combine it with the fact that all like christian
[01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:05.120]  religions are generally opposed to it you know like i grew up in a catholic family and it you
[01:59:05.120 --> 01:59:10.240]  know the catholic church considers it a sin you know they consider all sorts of i mean skipping
[01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:16.640]  church is a sin too but you know yeah sins are obviously bad things and you know that was under
[01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:26.560]  that rubric and you know people nobody was gay on tv and i know i mean tv is you know is is not a
[01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:33.680]  reflection of america or of culture as a whole but it it informs it right it's like what what
[01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:39.520]  aspects of culture make it onto tv somehow are like this is the parts of society this is the
[01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:45.680]  parts of our culture that are okay and nobody was gay on tv which meant it was not okay you know it
[01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:52.000]  was weird it was a bad time i think about this with my son who was the who was the center square
[01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:58.720]  guy on uh oh paul lend right paul lend on the hollywood squares in hindsight clearly i know
[01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:06.160]  totally gay he was as gay as anybody who's ever been gay and i had no idea i honestly as a kid
[02:00:06.160 --> 02:00:12.480]  this i mean and i'm not that old but i honestly thought that he was just flamboyant yeah i did
[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:18.880]  i did not i did not realize i had no idea just i i didn't know whereas like and i think it's
[02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:24.960]  amazing in one generation that like my son is growing up in a world where you know being gay
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:30.160]  is you know just like yeah having different colored skin it's just some people are that way
[02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:34.960]  you know and yeah you know we in philadelphia we you know people are gay all the time and
[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:40.320]  you know they are their friends at his school have you know some of his friends have two moms
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:46.240]  and you know it's it's not even he honestly doesn't even think about it yeah i don't hank's
[02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:50.160]  best frank's best friend from you know since growing up i mean he met this kid when he was
[02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:55.920]  one or two maybe maybe it was two but um very early on and he's got two moms and we were
[02:00:56.640 --> 02:01:05.120]  fortunate enough to go to their wedding um which was about a year ago so it's just it's awesome
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:10.560]  i cannot i'm so happy that the world has changed in this way but it's you know it's not like that
[02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:17.360]  everywhere and it certainly wasn't like that for tim cook growing up no yeah and it's and it's
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:20.960]  still not like that for some people and so i think that's why these you know somebody who's
[02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:28.640]  successful like him being able to tell his story is very important uh jonas's middle school he's
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:33.280]  in fifth grade now he's in middle school they have a club called uh glow i think this is so
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:40.160]  awesome it stands for gay lesbian or whatever i love that i think that is so awesome because to
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:46.800]  me that it sounds a little goofy it sounds a little fun but it really sort of expresses the
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:52.000]  the to me the the the modern way of thinking which is hey whatever floats your boat you know and
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:57.600]  everybody you know is different and some people are very different and it's all okay i love middle
[02:01:57.600 --> 02:02:02.480]  he's in middle school now well fifth grade is called middle school i don't know okay i guess
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:08.880]  yeah but i thought that's such a cool name and it's just to me it epitomizes the difference
[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:14.000]  between you know his world and my world right uh 30 years ago when i was in fifth grade because
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:19.360]  there was no way they were going to have a gay let's go to whatever club in my school yeah um
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:26.800]  you know and i i had syracuse had talked about this on atp but with the that the we've reached
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:37.120]  a point in our culture where where nobody everybody seems to uh agree that you can't be against
[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:44.480]  gay right it's it's like culturally agreed upon that it's just you know discriminatory it makes
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:51.520]  you a bad person to be against gays but you can still be things like against gay marriage like
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:57.360]  that's still like a culturally acceptable stance to take yeah decreasingly so though
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:06.640]  decreasingly so definitely uh and it's you know it's catching up to where racism was yeah i mean
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:12.800]  even people even people who are opposed to gay marriage now have a hard time not at least saying
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:18.880]  that they approve of uh civil unions and right and once you do that you're kind of like okay what's
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:25.360]  the right right it's right what you're drawing this difference between religious aspects of
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:31.120]  marriage and civil aspects of it where but nobody is endorsing a point that religions have to accept
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:38.080]  it right it's just that legally it has to be called the same thing right um and like like
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:43.600]  the the response so nobody i'm sure somewhere on you know obviously on the dark side of twitter
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:49.200]  there are where people have anonymous accounts at the you know all sorts oh yeah the ugliest thoughts
[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:56.240]  that humans can have are are espoused every second i saw well i saw something that i couldn't figure
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:04:03.120]  out if it was i i think it must have been tongue in cheek because uh the guy was saying you know
[02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:09.120]  tim cook is gay so you should switch to android and if you want i will come to your house and
[02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:18.160]  pick up your apple products and it was written and it wasn't written as a joke it seemed you
[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:22.640]  know i think you know like this is it was sort of like there was a lot there was at least a
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:28.720]  decent amount of text where this is an abomination of nature sort of thing but but but reading like
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:33.520]  the bottom line was the guy was offering to drive your house and pick up your apple products
[02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:49.040]  uh like the culturally acceptable way to sort of you know not just cheer and clap your hands at
[02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:57.040]  at cook's essay what is to sort of take us uh and i saw some of this a fair amount of it is is sort
[02:04:57.040 --> 02:05:04.880]  of who cares this isn't you know you know this is why why why why make this public this is you're
[02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:09.840]  making you're drawing more attention to to to the issue than you know it was totally cool before
[02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:15.120]  you actually you know tim cook actually wrote this story why why rub this in our faces i mean
[02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:19.040]  they wouldn't say it that way but that's sort of how it it comes across why are you putting this
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:24.240]  in my face why are you making me think about things that i don't want to think about uh
[02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:29.840]  and it's again i'm just riffing on syracusey here but it's it's true like as a single person
[02:05:29.840 --> 02:05:36.240]  you know one man however powerful he is that it doesn't make that big a difference that he's now
[02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:41.920]  publicly out as gay and proud of it than before when he just never spoke about it in public it
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:46.080]  doesn't make that big a difference but it well i think it doesn't make a difference to me
[02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:50.720]  particularly no but like i said i mean i think there's a there's a there are a bunch of people
[02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:54.880]  there are a bunch of people i mean they're you know it makes a difference if you're gay i think
[02:05:54.880 --> 02:06:00.240]  but we don't live you know that we're not all isolated from each other everything is related
[02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:06.560]  and in context yeah and you know and it does matter where we were 10 years ago and 15 years
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:12.880]  ago right it wasn't that long ago where it was controversial that will and grace had uh two gay
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:19.520]  characters as you know the the leads of a of a primetime network sitcom right whereas now that
[02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:26.720]  you mean it wasn't that long ago but it it wouldn't be an issue now at all right it's
[02:06:26.720 --> 02:06:31.760]  but we're coming very fast but we're not there yet right and it really does make a difference that
[02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:39.520]  there is a that one of the most powerful leaders in our country is out and proud of being gay
[02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:46.000]  right i mean how many how many kids are there right now just teenagers today in this country
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:53.600]  let alone other countries that are far behind us on this issue socially who uh are gay and are
[02:06:54.240 --> 02:07:00.160]  worried or even scared about telling their parents and coming out to their friends you know it's you
[02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:05.520]  know heartbreaking and it's still an issue and to have somebody like tim cook saying i i'm proud of
[02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:12.400]  it and consider it a gift from god is uh it's historic i really do think it's historic yeah
[02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:19.840]  i can't think because i can't think of any other executive i mean obviously i follow apple a lot
[02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:24.080]  closely than any other company so i'm sure that maybe there's somebody out there who's who's upset
[02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:28.960]  that i don't didn't pay attention but there was a guy i don't remember his name there was a guy who
[02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:33.920]  was like a charge of a bank a ceo of a bank but he didn't come out until after he'd resigned and
[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:38.560]  stepped down or retired or something like that and said that you know is that it was really it was it
[02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:44.080]  it was it you know as hard as it was and the other place that's happening now is his professional
[02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:54.160]  sports right so right it's uh might it's it's because a few things that have traditionally
[02:07:54.160 --> 02:07:59.600]  two places that have traditionally been fairly conservative that are now being forced to
[02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:08.000]  open up about what's really reality yeah i also thought the other thing that was remarkable not
[02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:13.520]  just that he did announce it but i thought it was such a well-written piece i reread it's so short
[02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:21.200]  very succinct and i firmly believe i'm sure that there you know he didn't write it without any
[02:08:21.200 --> 02:08:27.760]  help whatsoever editing or you know and and from within but i do think that it was his words you
[02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:34.000]  know in the same way to me it was like like the the steve jobs thoughts on music and steve jobs
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:39.440]  what was the other one thoughts on flash where you could tell that that it was jobs writing it yeah
[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:44.080]  right that there was it wasn't just his name at the bottom of the letter like like like what we
[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:49.680]  know of steve jobs and his obsessions in the way he thinks really came out in those two um
[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:56.000]  i don't know what you would call them essays essays yeah uh and i can't help but think that
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:04.560]  this this piece is so very tim cook in in the way that it's written there's a certain meticulousness
[02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:11.440]  to it and a tightness of thought and anywhere where you might be tempted to sort of roll your
[02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:17.360]  eyes at at the sort of idealism of it i think it's genuine i i don't think there's any reason
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:26.080]  to i think it's genuinely how he feels that he he truly feels like a social obligation to uh
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:33.520]  our society as a whole to to make things better in in this regard yeah do you think that there's
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:43.600]  there's a reason now as opposed to earlier i i do i don't know it's it's i mean to a certain
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:50.400]  degree it seems like the apple is at a better i'm in a better position currently in terms of
[02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:55.920]  public opinion because the stock price is doing better than it was like say a year ago i do i
[02:09:55.920 --> 02:10:01.760]  think that uh you know and who knows maybe he really only came to the decision maybe it was
[02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:06.160]  something he was thinking about maybe doing for a year or two years and and finally thought and
[02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:11.200]  maybe it just popped into his head maybe you know something in september made him think you know i
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:17.600]  i should i should come out because this this who knows how how long it was planned i don't know but
[02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:27.280]  in hindsight it sure feels perfectly timed yes right like in some way you know and it
[02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:38.160]  if he had been out for 15 years like and had been you know had like a a long time partner you know
[02:10:38.160 --> 02:10:44.400]  since before there was even legal gay marriage in california who accompanied him to events and
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:51.440]  therefore you know had been out while he was coo not ceo it certainly would have been his right
[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:56.480]  and nobody would right-minded would complain about it but it wouldn't have been as big a deal
[02:10:56.480 --> 02:11:03.280]  i don't think you know somehow it feels right and the fact that it it's how long is it since
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:09.200]  steve jobs is dead three years right three years yeah yeah 2011 somehow it feels like the right
[02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:16.560]  amount of time where the tumultuousness of of him taking over his past it seems like this year
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:23.200]  and it's like the transition period is over right um even though tim cook spent a lot of time
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:30.320]  almost effectively being ceo while jobs was sick right there were still you know jobs was still
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:36.160]  there he still had input into how the products were designed and made and he went to the point
[02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:41.120]  now where no one can reasonably say oh that you know yeah sure that's a good device but it was
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:47.600]  you know but jobs had his fingers in that so tim cook can't claim it as as his own right i i've
[02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:54.160]  long thought that it even before jobs was sick or what you know maybe he technically was sick
[02:11:54.160 --> 02:12:00.160]  because he you know had the cancer you know the whole period from when the cancer was first
[02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:05.280]  diagnosed until he died i guess he was technically sick the whole time but right even when he was
[02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:09.760]  feeling well and they thought they had everything in remission i still think that the the delegation
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:15.920]  of duties like what tim cook did at apple versus what steve jobs did tim cook was if you just
[02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:20.480]  described his duties to someone who didn't know their titles you'd say well he's the ceo yeah
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:25.280]  you know and that jobs is something else maybe the president or something like that you know
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:29.200]  it used to be a more com you know when we were kids a lot of companies had like a ceo and a
[02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:35.760]  president you know yeah i think the ceo is more about uh making company-wide decisions and stuff
[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:41.120]  like that you know stuff about the company and the bureaucracy of the company whereas jobs
[02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:47.760]  clearly even when he was you know healthy was more solely focused on the products and product
[02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:53.520]  development right right um but even so i still the timing just seems so perfect because like
[02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:59.120]  you said i think the transition period ended this year like the stock stabilized they've they've
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:04.240]  they haven't released it but they've at least unveiled a holy of the watch which is wholly
[02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:11.360]  formed post steve uh you know and it's you know it remains we've seen how it's going to
[02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:17.040]  you know it isn't out yet but it certainly seems as though there's no uh you know they're not
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:22.560]  unable to create a new product that gets people talking that's over the stock is back up uh
[02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:27.840]  and it just seems like people have finally shut the hell up about the the oh it wouldn't happen
[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:33.120]  if steve were still around i mean not entirely but it's like we've passed it i don't know remember a
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:38.160]  year ago like in 2013 i could look at all all in my claim chowder files but there were a lot of
[02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:44.000]  people literally calling for apple's board to fire tim cook you know fire tim cook he's terrible you
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:49.200]  know when the stall yeah and yeah you know we're passing it it just somehow feels right
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:55.280]  yeah i'm looking forward to uh the updated edition of of haunted empire
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:04.720]  has any book had a shorter shelf life when i wrote about it i did i wrote i was like i i really i
[02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:09.680]  almost feel like they knew it because it really does it part of what was i thought was bad about
[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:14.480]  the book is it felt rushed it felt like the editing it felt like it could have been tighter
[02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:18.880]  and i can't help but think that they wanted to rush it to the next level because it was
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:23.200]  to rush it out back in february because because they thought it was going to turn around right
[02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:29.040]  they they just you know i think the writing was on the wall that the thesis of the book
[02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:37.840]  was already wrong yeah gotta get out quick uh last thing the only thing i can think of i had
[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:43.600]  this in my notes as is is uh this uh do you see this thing yesterday with the twitter
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:51.600]  um mission statement strategy statement yes well and i've you read it i i can't even give me one
[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:56.880]  minute but i think about it and as i compare it to the tim cook essay on on you know coming out
[02:14:56.880 --> 02:15:03.120]  as gay and proud and how good the writing is and i say this is i maybe i value good writing more
[02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:06.560]  than most people because i'm a writer and i care about it but i can't help but i have this basic
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:12.240]  theory in general whether it's something personal like tim cook's thing or whether it's something
[02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:18.560]  purely business like like a strategy statement that good writing is the result of good thinking
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:26.240]  and bad writing is usually the result of sloppy thinking incomplete thinking you know that it
[02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:31.840]  and and here's the twitter's strategy statement that they released yesterday
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:38.160]  reach the largest daily audience in the world by connecting everyone to their world via our
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:43.840]  information sharing and distribution platform products and be one of the top revenue generating
[02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:51.680]  internet companies in the in the world and i can't believe more people i didn't jump on it right away
[02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:56.000]  but i couldn't believe that i was the first person i saw to point out that that was does not even
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:04.640]  close to fitting in the length of a tweet it's 220 characters right shouldn't your strategy
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:13.280]  statement fit in a tweet and especially if you're twitter it's so bad i had to put it into it longer
[02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:22.480]  tweet longer whatever that thing is called it's so bad it's really bad i mean it's yeah
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:29.280]  i really find it worrisome uh i find it very worrisome as a platform that i really care about
[02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:35.840]  and and in some level love but that seems to be floundering at an executive level you know there's
[02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:42.080]  just had some more executive shake-ups like where they're um that they've had like three heads of
[02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:48.160]  product in the last like two years uh and the last one they just demoted was only there six months
[02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:54.160]  it's it's i don't know very worrisome and this strategy statement doesn't make me feel any better
[02:16:54.160 --> 02:17:03.360]  about it it's like i wrote the other day about the net neutrality where uh like to me president
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:09.360]  obama's statement on it was very clearly written and there might be room to disagree there might
[02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:14.000]  be a reasonable argument against it but i thought that his arguments in favor of it
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:19.840]  were very clearly expressed one two three four here's the reasons that we should make sure we
[02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:25.440]  keep it keep this sort of not favoring one company's packets over another company's packets
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:31.440]  on the internet um keep it the way it is which has been that all packets are treated equally
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:38.080]  and the arguments on the other side from the cable companies and the phone providers are so
[02:17:38.080 --> 02:17:44.400]  obtuse and it's like you can read them and they're their words and i know what the words mean but
[02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:52.880]  damned if i know what the damned if i know what the uh what the meaning is yeah other than like
[02:17:52.880 --> 02:17:59.200]  remember the old saturday live skit with frankenstein and uh uh the caveman and frankenstein
[02:17:59.200 --> 02:18:06.960]  and uh forget the other one yeah uh were they saying christmas carols yeah it was like kevin
[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:16.240]  neil was a caveman and uh uh who was frankenstein that's a camera i can't remember and he all
[02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:22.640]  frankenstein ever said was like fire bad uh i can't help but think that the argument and the
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:30.240]  against this net neutrality is more or less a knee-jerk frankensteinian regulation bad regulation
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:36.320]  bad it's basically it right and i'm not one in favor of red tape and bureaucracy it's not you
[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:43.120]  know i really think you have to see government regulation as as a continuum you know a grayscale
[02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:50.480]  from light gray to dark gray not zero not not binary you know on or off uh and these companies
[02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:55.040]  are regulated already would you know it's not like comcast doesn't face some regulations it's
[02:18:55.040 --> 02:19:02.320]  who are the regulations kind of favor consumers and and small company startups or multi-billion
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:08.640]  dollar conglomerate like let's stack the deck in favor of verizon who is making eight billion
[02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:16.320]  dollars a quarter because they really need it they need to help yeah and i can't i the whole
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:25.360]  cynicism behind that i can't even understand because so there was that that comment that tweet
[02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:35.680]  by um ted cruz yes uh senator right from right from texas grades day to texas yeah and
[02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:43.840]  he said it's the obamacare for the internet right right right and let's not have the internet
[02:19:43.840 --> 02:19:49.440]  operate at the speed of government right and i tweeted something back you know some i i
[02:19:49.440 --> 02:19:56.480]  basically i insulted him i insulted his intelligence is what i did and and you know and
[02:19:56.480 --> 02:20:02.000]  josh centers who's the editor at tidbits correctly pointed out that he's the guy graduated like
[02:20:02.640 --> 02:20:07.760]  magna cum laude from harvard or something yeah i can't remember what i think that's right but
[02:20:07.760 --> 02:20:13.440]  and you know he's not he's actually not an idiot he's just an asshole i guess yeah
[02:20:13.440 --> 02:20:20.320]  he's just a cynical you know yeah he's yes who's protecting his buddies at the big cable industries
[02:20:20.320 --> 02:20:26.080]  yeah it's he's like a cum laude uh latte how do you pronounce it i don't know i guess if i ever
[02:20:26.080 --> 02:20:29.200]  went to harvard i didn't learn that's right that's right guys like us we don't know how to pronounce
[02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:37.040]  that right well with my grades it never really came up it never came up uh yeah he's definitely
[02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:41.680]  not a dummy but he's definitely a cynical because he knows how to communicate at this sort of
[02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:49.600]  caveman level of right internet you know government regulation bad and that goes no further than that
[02:20:49.600 --> 02:20:56.240]  and it you know you know it's the same people who think that the government should cut back
[02:20:56.240 --> 02:21:03.280]  on handouts and not decrease the size of their medicare check sure and social security right
[02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:07.840]  that's it's the other handouts right keep government out of my social security yeah
[02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:11.760]  that's it keep government out of my social security like that you ask people if you think
[02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:16.560]  the government should stay out of social security and you get like a 60 response rate that says yes
[02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:21.040]  keep them out of social security and it really doesn't make a lot of sense but anyway i'm i'm
[02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:26.160]  deeply worried about twitter and their their strategy yeah yeah i yeah like thinking about
[02:21:26.160 --> 02:21:32.240]  the future of that does not make me very happy yeah i can't help but think that the translation
[02:21:32.240 --> 02:21:36.080]  from whatever language this is written into english that the reach the largest daily
[02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:41.280]  audience in the world by connecting everyone to their in the world something something
[02:21:41.280 --> 02:21:47.520]  somewhere there they want to be more like facebook is to me what that means because facebook is more
[02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:52.320]  popular and that the target of this message was not normal people it was to bankers and investment
[02:21:52.320 --> 02:21:59.120]  people and you know people who've kept twitter's stock it's i think at last i checked it's slightly
[02:21:59.120 --> 02:22:04.560]  below where they ipo'd last year so it hasn't cratered it hasn't tanked but nobody has an ipo'd
[02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:09.600]  and hopes that the stock is flat in the first year you know and so there is some definite
[02:22:09.600 --> 02:22:14.000]  skepticism and that this is addressed at the people who've more or less kept their stock
[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:19.520]  depressed and in the meantime facebook is going up and up and up and it to me the translation of this
[02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:23.920]  is we're going to somehow try to be more like facebook whereas to me the whole point of twitter
[02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:28.880]  is that it's sort of an anti-facebook and whether that means that inherently they're always going
[02:22:28.880 --> 02:22:34.240]  to be smaller than facebook financially and user base wise so be it and so it's going to be
[02:22:34.240 --> 02:22:40.560]  it but at least be true to yourself you know and the whole reason that you've had any success at
[02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:46.480]  all is that you're not them right right there's nothing wrong sometimes a great idea isn't going
[02:22:46.480 --> 02:22:51.760]  to be the most successful version of that idea right that twitter i think is genius and is so
[02:22:51.760 --> 02:22:57.840]  well designed and so clever in so many ways but maybe the ways that it's genius and simple
[02:22:57.840 --> 02:23:02.720]  inherently mean that it can never be as big as facebook right and so be it it can still be
[02:23:02.720 --> 02:23:09.840]  profitable it you know that to me is the the the scary part of their the strategy statement
[02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:15.120]  is that to me it somehow translates into we're going to wreck what makes twitter twitter
[02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:20.800]  well address addresses nothing uh about what users like about twitter
[02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:28.240]  no yeah and it and that seems to be that that to me seems like the thing that you should be doing
[02:23:28.240 --> 02:23:33.200]  the thing you should be doing primarily in your mission statement and really only in your mission
[02:23:33.200 --> 02:23:40.880]  statement i mean that's what makes them a mission statement pithy and and make it makes it reach
[02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:46.240]  people and i worked in i worked at a financial services company back when it was good um our our
[02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:51.200]  the company or the statement back when the company was good or when the financial industry when the
[02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:54.800]  company was good all right i think it was the whole industry because if you're talking about
[02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:58.320]  the whole industry i thought you were gonna have to go back 300 years no no no just the company
[02:23:58.320 --> 02:24:02.480]  that i worked at and their mission statement was improving financial security for people
[02:24:02.480 --> 02:24:06.480]  was it that's not bad yeah no it was that's actually pretty good yeah it was really good
[02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:09.680]  i mean just like that's what people were you know they're like with taps into the thing that people
[02:24:09.680 --> 02:24:12.160]  are worried about they're worried about their financial security they want to make sure that
[02:24:12.160 --> 02:24:17.200]  they can retire and that's what we did that was you know that's what we tried to do anyway
[02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:22.480]  all right it's like uh backblaze for your finances yeah right right let you sleep better exactly
[02:24:22.480 --> 02:24:27.440]  let you sleep better exactly right i'm not choking right now you're right that's a good goal right
[02:24:27.440 --> 02:24:32.800]  if you feel like your personal your family's personal finances are in good hands and in sound
[02:24:32.800 --> 02:24:37.920]  shape for the future and for retirement you feel better you know just drifting off to sleep at
[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:45.920]  night yeah you know as opposed to being wide-eyed white knuckled you know what am i going to do
[02:24:46.960 --> 02:24:49.920]  anyway we should wrap it up so now i'm going to be wide-eyed wake about twitter
[02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:54.720]  um yeah white knuckled and we've already blown it with app.net we've already left
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:01.600]  that slide someday what are we going to do now someday we're going to come back
[02:25:01.600 --> 02:25:09.040]  hat in hand and they're they're going to be like we knew you too late sorry screw you people told
[02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:14.000]  you so like everything comes out everything you type into the box in app.net just it just
