[00:00.000 --> 00:03.500]  You ever get the feeling like maybe Yosemite isn't fully baked?
[00:03.500 --> 00:05.000]  Occasionally.
[00:07.000 --> 00:11.500]  So yeah, so I went back in and I futs with my input volume and I think it's, I think it might have been that.
[00:11.500 --> 00:16.000]  I don't know. I also restarted and did about 10 other things. I can't tell exactly.
[00:16.000 --> 00:22.000]  And the worst part is you just recorded a show two hours ago and everything's fine.
[00:22.000 --> 00:29.000]  Yeah, I don't know what happened. I didn't play stuff back in, but that shouldn't happen.
[00:29.000 --> 00:32.000]  I really cannot explain it.
[00:32.000 --> 00:34.000]  Now there's a new Skype 7 out.
[00:34.000 --> 00:37.000]  I don't know if I do.
[00:37.000 --> 00:43.000]  She just like keep one machine and pristine working condition and never unplug anything.
[00:43.000 --> 00:45.000]  Or restart it.
[00:45.000 --> 00:47.000]  That's sort of what I do with my MacBook Air.
[00:47.000 --> 00:52.000]  Like I haven't upgraded it to Yosemite. I'm being like old man conservative.
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.000]  You know, like if it ain't broke, don't fix it with this machine.
[00:57.000 --> 01:01.000]  And it's still, you know, and I don't update new versions of Skype.
[01:01.000 --> 01:03.000]  And it still gives me problems.
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.000]  You know, like trying to be real conservative about what I do with the software on this particular machine.
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.000]  It doesn't seem to make a difference.
[01:12.000 --> 01:16.000]  I upgrade everything.
[01:16.000 --> 01:22.000]  I have very little discipline.
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.000]  Did you run the machine, you ran the beta on and stuff like that?
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.000]  Yeah, but it's been very complicated.
[01:29.000 --> 01:32.000]  It's been complicated the last few months because I've had,
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.000]  I had from Apple.
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  And this wasn't just like a special treat for John Gruber thing.
[01:39.000 --> 01:43.000]  It was a lot of us got it.
[01:43.000 --> 01:45.000]  They gave us review units at WWDC.
[01:45.000 --> 01:49.000]  Like it was a 15 inch MacBook Pro with Yosemite already installed.
[01:49.000 --> 01:52.000]  Because they actually wanted us to be right about it.
[01:52.000 --> 01:57.000]  Yeah.
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.000]  So I had to do that.
[01:59.000 --> 02:05.000]  Yeah, he might have needed, he might have needed five.
[02:05.000 --> 02:08.000]  But you know, they gave him, they gave him an iPhone.
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.000]  I don't know if you listen to ATP, but he got an iPhone 6.
[02:13.000 --> 02:21.000]  So that he not to review the iPhone 6, but so he could write about continuity features.
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.000]  Which was actually really, really awesome that he, you know, it was a big help to him.
[02:25.000 --> 02:29.000]  They've been very helpful and stuff like that.
[02:29.000 --> 02:30.000]  But that machine has gone.
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  But now I'm down to two machines.
[02:32.000 --> 02:37.000]  I've got a new 13 inch MacBook Pro and I've already, you know, I've started life.
[02:37.000 --> 02:39.000]  I just got it like a month ago.
[02:39.000 --> 02:40.000]  It started on Yosemite.
[02:40.000 --> 02:42.000]  It's never seen anything but.
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.000]  And in my old MacBook Air, I just keep running minus one.
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  I had to get my wife needed a new machine.
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  I had to make sure I got it before Yosemite came on everything.
[02:50.000 --> 02:53.000]  Because she would freak.
[02:53.000 --> 02:58.000]  She doesn't like me to change her operating system.
[02:58.000 --> 02:59.000]  No.
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.000]  Oh, we've had this discussion before too.
[03:01.000 --> 03:04.000]  But she doesn't like it either like you'll walk by like her iPhone or whatever.
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.000]  And like, there'll be like a badge.
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.000]  Like I like on the apps for it.
[03:08.000 --> 03:09.000]  Oh my God.
[03:09.000 --> 03:10.000]  57 apps.
[03:10.000 --> 03:15.000]  Do you update your apps automatically?
[03:15.000 --> 03:17.000]  Do you have the app store set?
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.000]  Yeah. See, I don't have it set to update automatically.
[03:20.000 --> 03:26.000]  But I do like like OCD like every time there's updates, I didn't stall them.
[03:26.000 --> 03:29.000]  But the reason I don't do it automatically is I want to know when there's new ones.
[03:29.000 --> 03:31.000]  And I like to read the release now.
[03:31.000 --> 03:34.000]  Well, that's probably safer.
[03:34.000 --> 03:42.000]  And just in case, you know, I can't remember the last time that I've had like an app that I didn't want to update.
[03:42.000 --> 03:50.000]  There's you know, but you know, just in case there's like, you know, some kind of, you know, regression in an app.
[03:50.000 --> 03:51.000]  Yeah.
[03:51.000 --> 03:52.000]  It happens.
[03:52.000 --> 04:04.000]  Like the equivalent of like what they did with pages and the I work sweep on Mac, you know, going from online to whatever they call the new ones.
[04:04.000 --> 04:16.000]  And I mean, basically some of that is just because of the way the app store work, the, you know, the approval process, because I normally developers would just roll back something that was, you know, there was a glitch in it or something.
[04:16.000 --> 04:17.000]  And they can't, they can't do that.
[04:17.000 --> 04:18.000]  It's got it.
[04:18.000 --> 04:21.000]  You know, they have to, they have to resubmit.
[04:21.000 --> 04:22.000]  All right.
[04:22.000 --> 04:23.000]  Yeah.
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  You know, I noticed on while I'm talking about pages.
[04:27.000 --> 04:43.000]  I, my big complaint and the thing that I could not stand about the update to pages in particular is that for the few things I use word processing for like, for example, with sponsors, sometimes, you know, if I send them an invoice, I have a pages template and it's really nice.
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.000]  I've got nice typography on it.
[04:46.000 --> 05:08.000]  And for years now, maybe even 10 years, Mac OS X has had wonderful built in system level typography so that like an open type font that has small caps and alternate, you know, the figures, the, the old style figures where the numbers drop below the baseline or sometimes go above the baseline.
[05:08.000 --> 05:22.000]  And you can, system why you can just open text at it, the free text, you know, just the simple, you know, the replacement for simple text, go to fonts panel, open the typography panel and you get this wonderful typography controls.
[05:22.000 --> 05:27.000]  And my templates were all set up with, you know, small caps for certain things and stuff like that.
[05:27.000 --> 05:39.000]  And pages, the new version of pages last year, the 2013 version dropped support for all of that in the name of compatibility with iOS, which doesn't have any of those typography features anymore.
[05:39.000 --> 05:54.000]  So I stuck with the page like when pages in particular, I stuck with the online version like numbers there, I don't know, I don't know what the, you know, I'm such a simple, simpleton using a spreadsheet that I didn't notice anything worse in numbers.
[05:54.000 --> 05:58.000]  So I use the new version of numbers, but I use the old version of pages.
[05:58.000 --> 06:02.000]  But I noticed with the latest version of pages, it's, it is so complicated.
[06:02.000 --> 06:09.000]  Like I, I, they had like an update with Yosemite and I opened it hoping that the typography stuff was back.
[06:09.000 --> 06:23.000]  And it's not like you, if you've created a new document in pages and you have a font that has true small caps, not like the fake, you know, fake, fake small caps, but real small caps, there's no way to turn text into small caps in the new version of pages.
[06:23.000 --> 06:34.000]  But if you open in a pages or nine document in the new version of pages and you already have small caps, it now still supports it, it doesn't make it go away.
[06:34.000 --> 06:51.000]  So it, and it seems like what you can do, it doesn't, I didn't get into it too deep, but it seems like what you can do is you can open a new version of pages, you can switch to text at it and make your text in, you know, use the advanced OS 10 typography features.
[06:51.000 --> 06:55.000]  Copy and paste it, go back to pages and paste and it works.
[06:55.000 --> 06:56.000]  That's weird.
[06:56.000 --> 07:09.000]  So, so it's really, really like it, it, you know, it's like it seems like they're making some kind of progress on that front, but it's actually more complicated than it was a year ago when it's simple, it was just a simple answer, no, you can't use those features.
[07:12.000 --> 07:15.000]  It's like that, it's like that whole thing they do with the iMovie years ago.
[07:15.000 --> 07:26.000]  Yeah, yeah, when they switched from being a sort of very basic traditional non-linear video editor to do whatever that was.
[07:26.000 --> 07:28.000]  Right.
[07:28.000 --> 07:32.000]  We haven't seen that guy, it's a lot of reason, it looks like his name.
[07:32.000 --> 07:33.000]  Randy Ublis.
[07:33.000 --> 07:35.000]  Yeah, it's Randy still there.
[07:35.000 --> 07:39.000]  You know, he may not be there anymore.
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  That's a very good question.
[07:41.000 --> 07:48.000]  I heard something about him possibly leaving, not like out of any, you know, that he was in trouble, but sort of a, you know, that he'd been there.
[07:48.000 --> 07:57.000]  He'd been, you know, burned out, you know, that, you know, that, you know, just had been there on major, major software projects for years and years and he might not be there.
[07:57.000 --> 07:58.000]  I'm not sure.
[07:58.000 --> 07:59.000]  It's a good question.
[07:59.000 --> 08:04.000]  Anybody who knows a little birdies, you can tell me and then I'll do it if I'm sure Randy listens to the show.
[08:04.000 --> 08:06.000]  You know, you'd be surprised actually.
[08:06.000 --> 08:09.000]  I mean, that was half joke, but half not joke.
[08:09.000 --> 08:10.000]  All right.
[08:10.000 --> 08:15.000]  I actually got a very nice email from somebody at Comcast from the show with Merlin last week.
[08:15.000 --> 08:20.000]  It was actually a very, very nice email.
[08:20.000 --> 08:25.000]  Somebody is, you know, it seems to be a true fan of the show and they said that they were, they were half laughing, half crying.
[08:25.000 --> 08:28.000]  Oh man, the first hour of the show.
[08:28.000 --> 08:31.000]  They've since been fired.
[08:31.000 --> 08:35.000]  The ATP guys had a good, a good bit about the,
[08:35.000 --> 08:41.000]  no, he was not the guy who was the guy who I want to hear from as I want to hear from the guy who made that graphic.
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.000]  I want to hear the, I want to hear the story of how that graphic can be.
[08:46.000 --> 08:57.000]  No, but ATP guys had a good bit about the, the, the way that the I works apps regressed feature wise, you know, and comparing contrast that with Microsoft,
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  which, you know, never takes features away.
[09:00.000 --> 09:08.000]  There's ever an advanced, you know, if word ever gains advanced typography features, you can bank on it that it's never going to lose them in the future.
[09:08.000 --> 09:09.000]  Yeah.
[09:09.000 --> 09:13.000]  And the other thing that they brought up and this to me is so crazy.
[09:13.000 --> 09:16.000]  It's like I cannot believe that it's true.
[09:16.000 --> 09:17.000]  And I didn't even know it.
[09:17.000 --> 09:21.000]  I actually have it like Mark to do more research on it and link it up from Darren Fireball.
[09:21.000 --> 09:26.000]  But apparently the new version of at least pages, but maybe it's the whole I work suite.
[09:26.000 --> 09:34.000]  No longer reads documents, I work documents that are older than the versions created by the O nine versions.
[09:34.000 --> 09:35.000]  Really.
[09:35.000 --> 09:36.000]  So like, yeah.
[09:36.000 --> 09:44.000]  So like pages like the oldest pages document you can open now and then current version of pages is from pages of nine.
[09:44.000 --> 09:51.000]  Anything created with a version of pages earlier than pages of nine will no longer open in pages, which is crazy.
[09:51.000 --> 09:57.000]  Because I was about to delete the old version, you know, the O nine version because it puts that stuff in a folder.
[09:57.000 --> 09:59.000]  And I was thinking, I can just get rid of that.
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.000]  I work O nine folder.
[10:01.000 --> 10:02.000]  That's not.
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  No, no, it's crazy.
[10:04.000 --> 10:16.000]  Or at the very least, and it sounds like such, it's such busy work, but you really like the sensible idea, you know, what you really need to do is find every single I work document that you have and open it.
[10:16.000 --> 10:22.000]  Got it.
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  Seriously, this is what we would have to do.
[10:24.000 --> 10:34.000]  What we will have to do is open up every version and any document we can find that's older than O nine and make sure it's saved as O nine at the very least.
[10:34.000 --> 10:35.000]  I'll take it back.
[10:35.000 --> 10:45.000]  I'm sure I got some someplace, but I don't probably can't find them right now and try it, but I will make sure I'm going to add a note and put that in the show notes and I will have a link where everybody
[10:45.000 --> 10:48.000]  can do that, but I got to write from it from turn, but it's so crazy.
[10:48.000 --> 11:04.000]  And you know, the ATP can rightly point it out that that is exactly like where Microsoft is so great because like you just, I'm like, like you know that word today, like go by the latest version of Microsoft Word.
[11:04.000 --> 11:08.000]  You know it opens a dot word 1.0 document.
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  No, but you know that it does.
[11:10.000 --> 11:16.000]  You know that again.
[11:16.000 --> 11:26.000]  Like if you'd set up like a 1984 like PC running like DOS two and like the first version of Microsoft Word for DOS.
[11:26.000 --> 11:27.000]  I don't even know what.
[11:27.000 --> 11:35.000]  But maybe DOS came out later in 1984, whatever the first year that DOS one, you know, DOS had Microsoft Word created document and save it.
[11:35.000 --> 11:40.000]  I guarantee you that that document will open with full fidelity in today's Microsoft Word.
[11:40.000 --> 11:46.000]  Did you work, did you use word back back in the back in the day?
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  No, I was always a Mac right, man.
[11:48.000 --> 11:49.000]  Oh, okay.
[11:49.000 --> 11:50.000]  Mac right.
[11:50.000 --> 11:51.000]  Mac, okay.
[11:51.000 --> 11:52.000]  Yeah.
[11:52.000 --> 11:57.000]  Yeah, I used word until what was at word six where they screwed everything up.
[11:57.000 --> 12:01.000]  And then yeah, and then I started using word perfect.
[12:01.000 --> 12:06.000]  Yeah, Mac.
[12:06.000 --> 12:12.000]  Yeah, yeah, we use my wife and he's word perfect for years, even like long after it had been basically forgotten.
[12:12.000 --> 12:15.000]  I don't even know if I ever even used word perfect on the Mac.
[12:15.000 --> 12:16.000]  It was kind of nice.
[12:16.000 --> 12:17.000]  And it was pretty.
[12:17.000 --> 12:23.000]  I guess the thing was it was always popular word perfect was huge in the legal community, I think.
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.000]  I remember correctly for some reason.
[12:25.000 --> 12:29.000]  And then word was like everywhere else.
[12:29.000 --> 12:33.000]  And yeah, it was a big, it was a big problem for a lot of I think.
[12:33.000 --> 12:43.000]  And that's kind of what drove a lot of people to switch to PCs because it's like they were using word and they had to switch to word anyway.
[12:43.000 --> 12:48.000]  And so they're using word perfect and they had to switch to on a Mac and they had to switch to word anyway.
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  And so they're like, well, I might as well just switch.
[12:51.000 --> 12:52.000]  I got to buy a license.
[12:52.000 --> 12:55.000]  So I'm just going to go buy them PC.
[12:55.000 --> 13:01.000]  One thing from that era was that there were no demos for commercial software.
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.000]  And the commercial software was very expensive.
[13:04.000 --> 13:10.000]  So you really, your only options were to pirate it or spend a significant amount of money.
[13:10.000 --> 13:18.000]  Like probably I'm guessing, you know, like a word perfect for Mac was probably like $149.
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.000]  Oh, that was like the student license.
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.000]  Yeah, maybe even $199.
[13:24.000 --> 13:32.000]  That's like like $1990, you know, not, you know, which is, you know, it's not, it's long enough ago that inflation is some, you know,
[13:32.000 --> 13:33.000]  we were still using gold.
[13:33.000 --> 13:41.000]  You could exchange, you could take that dollar and exchange it for gold with the government.
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.000]  No, I was always a Mac, right?
[13:45.000 --> 13:46.000]  Mac, right, man.
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  And part of it maybe was just that I don't think I had to pay for it.
[13:49.000 --> 13:56.000]  I think because at Drexel, we, we had like a university wide site license for everything from Clara's.
[13:56.000 --> 14:04.000]  And you could just go to the student center and at least my first, like first couple of years, like the early 90s, like 9192,
[14:04.000 --> 14:07.000]  you'd go to the student center with blank floppies.
[14:07.000 --> 14:10.000]  And there was a machine where you would just put them in.
[14:10.000 --> 14:16.000]  And it would one by one, you know, you'd say I want, you know, the whole Clara suite, you know,
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  forget what else they had, but, you know, it was like Mac writing something else.
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.000]  We had Excel though, because it wasn't a Clara spreadsheet at the time.
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.000]  And we had like a, like a university wide site license for Excel too.
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.000]  And you would just go there with, you know, all you had to do is bring your own floppies.
[14:32.000 --> 14:40.000]  When you bring your own floppies and you'd get like officially licensed installed disks for Excel and Mac, right?
[14:40.000 --> 14:45.000]  You know, I always like, I can, I can remember not getting, getting unofficially licensed somewhere that way.
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  You could copy.
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.000]  You could have a lot of that shop onto a floppy disk.
[14:51.000 --> 14:52.000]  Yeah.
[14:52.000 --> 14:53.000]  It's crazy.
[14:53.000 --> 15:01.000]  That, it is absolutely crazy, which was like 1.44 megabytes if it was double density, high density.
[15:01.000 --> 15:03.000]  Right?
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.000]  There was like the original floppies, you know, that.
[15:06.000 --> 15:14.000]  But how there were 400 K ones, Syracuse, Syracuse, it always dings me on this because I, whenever we go retro on the show,
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  I always say that they started at 800.
[15:16.000 --> 15:24.000]  No, they're like, like 1984's max had 400 K, 3.5 inch floppies.
[15:24.000 --> 15:27.000]  And then then 800 was for a while.
[15:27.000 --> 15:31.000]  So that was a little, I think the 800 were called double density and high density.
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  So 1.4 meg, high density.
[15:34.000 --> 15:35.000]  Ran out of number.
[15:35.000 --> 15:40.000]  Remember you could take, remember you could take a double density, the 800 K one.
[15:40.000 --> 15:48.000]  And if you punched a hole in the corner, you could, the floppy drive would treat it as a high density.
[15:48.000 --> 15:49.000]  What?
[15:49.000 --> 15:50.000]  Yeah.
[15:50.000 --> 16:01.000]  Because there was like, for backwards compatibility, the way that they did it was the high density, the ones that were, you know, 1.4 megabyte capacity,
[16:01.000 --> 16:04.000]  where the exact same form factor as the 800 K ones.
[16:04.000 --> 16:13.000]  So you could put it in the same drive, but the way the drive would recognize that it was high density is that the, the high density ones had a hole in the corner.
[16:13.000 --> 16:25.000]  And if you took like, it was, that people may, I don't know if you could just use a hole punch, but there was like a thing that people maybe you could buy that you would punch a hole in an 800 K disk.
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  And then the, the drive would treat it as a high density one.
[16:29.000 --> 16:39.000]  Even though like the manufacturer hadn't like made it for that, like that's how loose and loosey, loosey we were with our data back then.
[16:39.000 --> 16:44.000]  Needless to say, those floppies sometimes had a little bit of problems.
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.000]  No, that's, that's how the world would work back then.
[16:47.000 --> 16:51.000]  And you could fit, you had to be able to fit an app on one disk.
[16:51.000 --> 17:04.000]  I guess you could, there were installers for big, bigger software where the software would run across multiple disks and it would be like a zip file or the equivalent that was spread across multiple.
[17:04.000 --> 17:05.000]  Yeah.
[17:05.000 --> 17:05.000]  Right.
[17:05.000 --> 17:06.000]  Yeah, I remember that.
[17:06.000 --> 17:07.000]  I remember that.
[17:07.000 --> 17:12.000]  You could, you could use, or you could use stuff it to spread them across multiple.
[17:12.000 --> 17:13.000]  Oh, this.
[17:13.000 --> 17:17.000]  I had, this is a dumb story, but I want to tell it anyway.
[17:17.000 --> 17:23.000]  I found my, so I, my son loves playing with the old computers that I've got lying around because like, you know, because I'm a hoarder.
[17:23.000 --> 17:27.000]  And they're, we have got to, we've still got to perform about 6400.
[17:27.000 --> 17:32.000]  And we came, we were down at a basement, we came across a box full of zip disks.
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  And he's like, oh, he's like, what are these?
[17:34.000 --> 17:35.000]  Oh, we should try these.
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.000]  And so we went through this ridiculous process because.
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.000]  So I was like, okay, we'll get the zip, I still have the zip drive.
[17:41.000 --> 17:45.000]  So we get the zip drive out and plug it into the 6400.
[17:45.000 --> 17:48.000]  And we start the 6400 up.
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  And there's a password on it.
[17:50.000 --> 17:52.000]  And I can't remember what the password is.
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  And so, okay, that's fine.
[17:54.000 --> 17:55.000]  There's a way around that.
[17:55.000 --> 18:00.000]  And the way is like, if you boot off with something else, you can get, you can get in and just delete.
[18:00.000 --> 18:03.000]  This is the high security on, on OS nine.
[18:03.000 --> 18:09.000]  You could just delete a file in the, in the, in the systems preferences folder.
[18:09.000 --> 18:11.000]  Go into the system folder, go into the preferences folder.
[18:11.000 --> 18:15.000]  You just delete a file and restart it's fine, but you got to start with some off stuff in the house.
[18:15.000 --> 18:17.000]  Well, that model won't start off a floppy disk.
[18:17.000 --> 18:19.000]  So you have to start off a CD drive.
[18:19.000 --> 18:22.000]  Well, the CD drive was broken in the 6400.
[18:22.000 --> 18:27.000]  So, you know, and I don't know why I get this compulsion to do this.
[18:27.000 --> 18:29.000]  But I'm like, I got to solve this problem now.
[18:29.000 --> 18:33.000]  It's like, not only do I have to solve this problem, I got to stay up late solving this problem.
[18:33.000 --> 18:40.000]  So I pull the drive, the hard drive at 6400 and I take it up and I put it in.
[18:40.000 --> 18:46.000]  And my, my power Mac, my G4 power Mac, as an extra drive, start up,
[18:46.000 --> 18:50.000]  delete the file, take it back down, put it back in the 6400.
[18:50.000 --> 18:54.000]  And as I'm putting it back in the 6400 and reconnecting everything,
[18:54.000 --> 19:00.000]  I have the zip drive sitting on top of the 6400 and just down in the basement.
[19:00.000 --> 19:05.000]  There's cement floor and I knock the zip drive off when I break the zip drive.
[19:05.000 --> 19:10.000]  So I went through this huge process and in the end,
[19:10.000 --> 19:14.000]  I destroyed the thing that I was trying to connect to the Mac.
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  Awesome.
[19:16.000 --> 19:17.000]  So, yeah.
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  Well, now I'm looking at new zip drives.
[19:19.000 --> 19:22.000]  So I'm in the market for a new zip drive.
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.000]  Now, I was like, look, I did look on eBay and it's like 15,
[19:25.000 --> 19:27.000]  15, 20 bucks to get an old zip drive.
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  And I was like, what, what am I doing?
[19:29.000 --> 19:32.000]  At the point where it actually came to selling out money.
[19:32.000 --> 19:35.000]  My time is worthless, but my money is not.
[19:35.000 --> 19:37.000]  Exactly.
[19:37.000 --> 19:41.000]  Like, you easily bird, you easily bird 10 times that.
[19:41.000 --> 19:42.000]  It's time.
[19:42.000 --> 19:46.000]  You easily burn hundreds of dollars for the hours.
[19:46.000 --> 19:51.000]  Like, like imagine if, like somebody commissioned you to write an article
[19:51.000 --> 19:52.000]  that would take that long.
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.000]  And then they said, and it pays 15 dollars.
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.000]  You'd be like, no, no, thank you.
[19:57.000 --> 19:58.000]  Right.
[19:58.000 --> 20:02.000]  But when it came time to actually give somebody 15 bucks for an old zip drive,
[20:02.000 --> 20:05.000]  it was like, oh man, no way am I wasting money on that.
[20:05.000 --> 20:10.000]  So actually, I actually had you had caused to use word recently,
[20:10.000 --> 20:16.000]  speaking of the price of word and, you know, that being able to get a license,
[20:16.000 --> 20:19.000]  because you could just get it like an office 360 license for,
[20:19.000 --> 20:21.000]  you can pay by the month.
[20:21.000 --> 20:26.000]  And it's like seven bucks a month or something like that for just the regular.
[20:26.000 --> 20:28.000]  Yeah, I mean, so there's no for the Mac version.
[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  There's no like enterprise stuff.
[20:30.000 --> 20:31.000]  There's no access.
[20:31.000 --> 20:32.000]  That's true.
[20:32.000 --> 20:35.000]  That I saw that that this week and that, you know,
[20:35.000 --> 20:39.000]  the news, you know, the big news story this week from Microsoft was,
[20:39.000 --> 20:41.000]  I mean, I don't know if it was within the last week,
[20:41.000 --> 20:47.000]  but that they've made the, the mobile versions of the office apps.
[20:47.000 --> 20:50.000]  Free to use, like pretty much.
[20:50.000 --> 20:51.000]  No.
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  For the basic functionality of it.
[20:53.000 --> 20:54.000]  Yes.
[20:54.000 --> 20:56.000]  But it's read, you know, read, read right.
[20:56.000 --> 20:57.000]  Yeah.
[20:57.000 --> 21:00.000]  Like they think before it was like you could read documents, but you couldn't write them.
[21:00.000 --> 21:05.000]  And now you can edit them and you can't do track changes.
[21:05.000 --> 21:08.000]  And probably a couple of, I mean, I'm sure there's some other stuff.
[21:08.000 --> 21:11.000]  But the big one I think that people often use is track changes.
[21:11.000 --> 21:12.000]  Right.
[21:12.000 --> 21:15.000]  And you have to pay for a license for.
[21:15.000 --> 21:18.000]  And that's, and they came out with Android versions too.
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  Oh, is that only missed that part of that story?
[21:20.000 --> 21:21.000]  That's interesting.
[21:21.000 --> 21:26.000]  Uh, I think so. Let me, I mean, I think they, because they, they definitely
[21:26.000 --> 21:29.000]  and said that they were going to do that.
[21:29.000 --> 21:33.000]  And there was some, there was somebody I saw somebody retweeted.
[21:33.000 --> 21:34.000]  Yeah.
[21:34.000 --> 21:35.000]  Okay.
[21:35.000 --> 21:39.000]  An executive from Google saying can't wait to see the versions for Android.
[21:39.000 --> 21:40.000]  Yeah.
[21:40.000 --> 21:44.000]  Microsoft Office mobile is the official office companion optimized for your Android phone.
[21:44.000 --> 21:48.000]  You can access view and edit your Microsoft Word Excel.
[21:48.000 --> 21:49.000]  And I'm guessing.
[21:49.000 --> 21:51.000]  Yeah.
[21:51.000 --> 21:52.000]  It's not that.
[21:52.000 --> 21:53.000]  Yeah.
[21:53.000 --> 21:54.000]  Yeah.
[21:54.000 --> 21:55.000]  They have Android versions.
[21:55.000 --> 21:58.000]  It seems, you know, that.
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  And again, you know, it's this, we're with Microsoft Word.
[22:00.000 --> 22:04.000]  It's like the most the same boat as with Apple with, you know, what would,
[22:04.000 --> 22:07.000]  they've done if the old CEO is still there, except, you know,
[22:07.000 --> 22:10.000]  Balmer isn't that, but it does seem though.
[22:10.000 --> 22:14.000]  But this, it does seem though that this is a.
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  Balmer had to go for this.
[22:16.000 --> 22:17.000]  Yeah.
[22:17.000 --> 22:20.000]  And it makes you wonder.
[22:20.000 --> 22:25.000]  How different Microsoft position in mobile might have been if they had done
[22:25.000 --> 22:26.000]  it sooner.
[22:26.000 --> 22:27.000]  Right.
[22:27.000 --> 22:31.000]  Like what if they had done it in 2009?
[22:31.000 --> 22:36.000]  At least for iOS, because I had to face it, but in 2009,
[22:36.000 --> 22:39.000]  Android wasn't good as a platform wasn't good enough for stuff like office.
[22:39.000 --> 22:44.000]  But if at least for the iPhone, they had done it then.
[22:44.000 --> 22:49.000]  And then in 2010, when the iPad came out, they would have already been on iOS,
[22:49.000 --> 22:55.000]  and they could have, you know, if the iPad had debuted in a world where there's already
[22:55.000 --> 23:00.000]  a functional Microsoft office suite, the point that could, that could have really
[23:00.000 --> 23:07.000]  changed their, you know, their status overall in the post PC world.
[23:07.000 --> 23:08.000]  Yeah.
[23:08.000 --> 23:13.000]  I'm just wondering if it really with so much, I mean, because the office is
[23:13.000 --> 23:22.000]  the office products aren't really tied into the way that people work as much as they used to be.
[23:22.000 --> 23:29.000]  And so much of our, you know, the things that we produce are for the web and office apps
[23:29.000 --> 23:33.000]  or not applications are not really used for web production.
[23:33.000 --> 23:35.000]  Well, for us, that's true.
[23:35.000 --> 23:39.000]  And I suspect it's true for a lot of the people who listen to like our shows.
[23:39.000 --> 23:44.000]  But my, my, my test for what goes on in a real world is always the, the
[23:44.000 --> 23:49.000]  snooping I do in airports, you know, not snooping, but, you know, looking over what,
[23:49.000 --> 23:53.000]  what's this guy, you know, as I go to the bathroom on the plane, just look at what's on people's dreams.
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  That's what they do.
[23:55.000 --> 23:59.000]  And I've noticed a lot, I've mentioned this before, but I see it over and over again.
[23:59.000 --> 24:03.000]  I noticed a lot of business people who, you know, just judging by their
[24:03.000 --> 24:09.000]  attire and judging by the fact that they have PCs and that a lot of times I see,
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  I see PowerPoint and Excel.
[24:11.000 --> 24:13.000]  I see, I see a lot of a lot of Excel.
[24:13.000 --> 24:20.000]  And I also see a lot of outlook email, like piece, you know, windows and outlook.
[24:20.000 --> 24:25.000]  And then like, I see them like, you know, an hour and a half into the flight,
[24:25.000 --> 24:30.000]  they fold up the, the laptop and then they take out an iPad for the rest of the flight.
[24:30.000 --> 24:33.000]  I see it over and over and over again.
[24:33.000 --> 24:34.000]  Right?
[24:34.000 --> 24:37.000]  It's like they've got, they want to, you know, they want to get caught up on their email,
[24:37.000 --> 24:40.000]  or they're working on a thing in Excel.
[24:40.000 --> 24:44.000]  And as soon as they're done with it, then, you know, when it's time to, like,
[24:44.000 --> 24:46.000]  relax, they go to an iPad.
[24:46.000 --> 24:47.000]  Yeah.
[24:47.000 --> 24:50.000]  You sure they're not just popping the keyboard off their surface?
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  You know what?
[24:52.000 --> 24:53.000]  It's funny.
[24:53.000 --> 24:58.000]  I, we can make fun of the surface, but I've, I've seen more and more of them in the world.
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.000]  I definitely am. It's no longer a fluke.
[25:01.000 --> 25:05.000]  Well, I don't think it's so great, but it's not, it's not as.
[25:05.000 --> 25:06.000]  All right.
[25:06.000 --> 25:07.000]  Much of, it's not quite the punchline.
[25:07.000 --> 25:08.000]  Yeah.
[25:08.000 --> 25:09.000]  Yeah.
[25:09.000 --> 25:14.000]  It's, it's, I see more of them than I see people using windows phones.
[25:14.000 --> 25:18.000]  And again, maybe I'm, now maybe it's just easier to notice because people,
[25:18.000 --> 25:22.000]  if I see someone using a surface, it's pretty easy to identify it as a surface.
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.000]  And it's, it's kind of hard to tell what phone somebody is using.
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  It could usually tell iPhone.
[25:28.000 --> 25:29.000]  Right.
[25:29.000 --> 25:30.000]  Right.
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.000]  From the back, without seeing the screen, it's, you can usually tell iPhone or not iPhone,
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.000]  but if it's a not iPhone, who'd to help knows what it is.
[25:37.000 --> 25:41.000]  And as you can see the screen, but on the other hand, if you can see the screen,
[25:41.000 --> 25:45.000]  Windows phone is so distinctive, you, I wise, I think it's pretty easy.
[25:45.000 --> 25:46.000]  Yeah.
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  And I don't see many of that.
[25:48.000 --> 25:49.000]  I see a lot more surface tablets.
[25:49.000 --> 25:50.000]  Yeah.
[25:50.000 --> 25:58.000]  Do you see the whole thing where, where the, the on election night, the CNN anchors
[25:58.000 --> 26:03.000]  were, were paid to use surfaces have.
[26:03.000 --> 26:04.000]  Right.
[26:04.000 --> 26:09.000]  Just sort of like, pretty much exactly like they've done with the NFL for like a year or two,
[26:09.000 --> 26:18.000]  where every, they've, they've like carpet bombed all the NFL studio teams, you know,
[26:18.000 --> 26:21.000]  like where they, let's go back half time, let's get here the half time report.
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.000]  And everybody in the studio has a surface in front of them.
[26:24.000 --> 26:30.000]  Well, on a, and CNN shots, or you could tell that their, their surfaces were,
[26:30.000 --> 26:34.000]  were being used to pop up an iPad.
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.000]  It's, it's like, it's like, you're standing, everybody loves the kickstand.
[26:38.000 --> 26:39.000]  Right.
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.000]  Makes a great stand for your right.
[26:41.000 --> 26:42.000]  It's, I really do mean this.
[26:42.000 --> 26:46.000]  I, I think as like a marketing move, that's actually worse.
[26:46.000 --> 26:51.000]  It was overall, the overall net effect of that campaign that was, was actually worse.
[26:51.000 --> 26:55.000]  Cause I think there were more people who noticed, you know, who caught onto the,
[26:55.000 --> 27:00.000]  I, you know, they were actually propping up iPads angle, then who noticed, you know,
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.000]  from TV like, hey, it looks like a Microsoft surface.
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  It's actually worse.
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  I think it actually hurts their, their efforts.
[27:08.000 --> 27:11.000]  Cause it makes it seem like their products at joke.
[27:11.000 --> 27:16.000]  I'm actually in the mark, I might be in the market for a, for a PC.
[27:16.000 --> 27:24.000]  Cause my son who likes to play games and has his, his most of his buddies or PC users,
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.000]  he's got like this identification thing now where he wants to get a, he wants to get a PC.
[27:29.000 --> 27:35.000]  And it's like some of the, some of the Minecraft stuff is actually a little bit easier to manage.
[27:35.000 --> 27:43.000]  And because some of the, on a, on a PC because the install, they're specific installers that are written for windows instead of
[27:43.000 --> 27:50.000]  other clients and where they're less, they're more generic on the Mac and Linux.
[27:50.000 --> 27:59.000]  So, so the, it's an, it's a weird problem to have to be in this, in that market because I can't figure out what,
[27:59.000 --> 28:10.000]  I mean, I have no idea what to get. Like trying to find a laptop, a windows laptop that is, you know, with my, with my Mac standard.
[28:10.000 --> 28:17.000]  It's really difficult. There's nothing of the same quality, at least not in the same kind of price range.
[28:17.000 --> 28:22.000]  Most of the stuff is plastic and the higher end stuff.
[28:22.000 --> 28:27.000]  Like there's the razor blade is supposed to be a great gaming laptop PC.
[28:27.000 --> 28:32.000]  But he wants a laptop. Yeah. Well, I think he should have a laptop. Yeah.
[28:32.000 --> 28:40.000]  He likes to, I mean, he was around a lot. And, you know, he'd like to take it with him when we travel and stuff like that.
[28:40.000 --> 28:48.000]  But the razor, the razor blade starts at like, 1900 bucks. And I'm not going to give, you know, he's going to spill like a, like, a $1,900.
[28:48.000 --> 28:57.000]  $900 for starting price for a razor blade. Yeah. It's a nice looking computer. I mean, it's like, it's like a black, you know, looks like a,
[28:57.000 --> 29:07.000]  I say that I just realized that I said that like I was totally offended. And I just, I just blew, I just blew like $3,500 on my MacBook Pro.
[29:07.000 --> 29:15.000]  Which I didn't blink at because I know that it's an excellent machine and it's made of aluminum and as an SSD and a retina screen and it's from Apple and it's really nice.
[29:15.000 --> 29:20.000]  And I just assumed that the nicest PC there is couldn't possibly pass that much.
[29:20.000 --> 29:29.000]  I realized that that was a very biased. No, I can totally, you know, you don't buy a 10 year old in 1999.
[29:29.000 --> 29:39.000]  No, I don't know if buying a 19 year old laptop. And then the other ones are the alien, the alien wares are supposedly decent gaming laptops, but they started 11, like $100.
[29:39.000 --> 29:44.000]  And I don't know, they're big clunky, you know, they're.
[29:44.000 --> 29:49.000]  So it wouldn't, you know, I'm not sure if this, if this experiment is going to take or not.
[29:49.000 --> 29:54.000]  Do you, you don't think though that, what's it called?
[29:54.000 --> 30:00.000]  When you reboot a Mac into Windows boot camp, boot camp is not the solution.
[30:00.000 --> 30:07.000]  Well, he needs a new machine because he's, he's using an old, he's using my old MacBook Pro, which is like 2010.
[30:07.000 --> 30:08.000]  Right.
[30:08.000 --> 30:11.000]  And he's, you know, he's banging it up pretty.
[30:11.000 --> 30:18.000]  Hopefully. Well, and the truth is, I mean, I, I mean, among, you know, there's what, there's video editing.
[30:18.000 --> 30:26.000]  I mean, there's a few things that, that work wise really push a machine these days, but gaming, it's always going to be at, always.
[30:26.000 --> 30:34.000]  I mean, until the end of our lives, it's going to, you know, there's never going to be a decrease in pushing the limits of computing, you know,
[30:34.000 --> 30:45.000]  and again, you know, a four year old computer in the gaming world is ancient, combine that with the fact that MacBooks aren't exactly known for being optimized for gaming in the first place when they're brand new.
[30:45.000 --> 30:48.000]  And you can really, you know, I can see how it's a problem.
[30:48.000 --> 30:54.000]  Yeah. I mean, so I could get, you know, I could get like a $700 Lenovo.
[30:54.000 --> 30:57.000]  That has a nice video card in it.
[30:57.000 --> 30:59.000]  I mean, the thing is made out of plastic.
[30:59.000 --> 31:05.000]  The outside is terrible, but it comes with a gigs of RAM and it's got a good video card in it.
[31:05.000 --> 31:07.000]  Well, hold that thought. Let's come back to that.
[31:07.000 --> 31:08.000]  Yeah, sure.
[31:08.000 --> 31:11.000]  And thank our first sponsor, but we'll come back to this because it ties into something else.
[31:11.000 --> 31:13.000]  It's Lenovo.
[31:13.000 --> 31:16.000]  It's our good friends at Squarespace.
[31:16.000 --> 31:18.000]  Now, you guys know Squarespace.
[31:18.000 --> 31:21.000]  They're, it's a great way to build your own website.
[31:21.000 --> 31:28.000]  I just think back to what it was like before things like Squarespace existed, where if you wanted to start a new website and you know,
[31:28.000 --> 31:35.000]  you had to start in something like BB at it with new document and that's where you're starting from.
[31:35.000 --> 31:37.000]  It was daunting.
[31:37.000 --> 31:43.000]  Like, and it would, you know, you'd only start a new website if you really had wanted to devote a lot of time to just getting it off the ground.
[31:43.000 --> 31:53.000]  Whereas with Squarespace, if you have an idea for a new website, you can actually like have the website up and running in like minutes instead of days.
[31:53.000 --> 31:54.000]  It's amazing.
[31:54.000 --> 31:59.000]  It's just a totally different world and so much easier.
[31:59.000 --> 32:00.000]  Now, they've been around for a while.
[32:00.000 --> 32:02.000]  They've been sponsoring this show and other shows for a while.
[32:02.000 --> 32:08.000]  I know you've heard about them, but they've just launched what they're calling Squarespace 7.
[32:08.000 --> 32:16.000]  And you can go to squarespace.com slash 7, S-E-V-E-N, spell it out for more information on the stuff that's new.
[32:16.000 --> 32:22.000]  But the key points, they've got a redesigned Squarespace 7 interface and it's really, really nice.
[32:22.000 --> 32:26.000]  I think their old interface was nice, but the new one is even better.
[32:26.000 --> 32:34.000]  Integration with Google Apps, which is huge for a lot of places that are, you know, all in on Google Apps.
[32:34.000 --> 32:39.000]  They have a partnership with Getty Images, so it's a lot easier.
[32:39.000 --> 32:47.000]  It's just built right into the Squarespace system to get stock photography and stock illustration for stuff.
[32:47.000 --> 32:55.000]  With new templates, they have cover pages now and a whole bunch more.
[32:55.000 --> 33:00.000]  Really simple and powerful, really beautiful design.
[33:00.000 --> 33:07.000]  The templates are just top-notch, truly professional templates that you can just start with and then tweet from there.
[33:07.000 --> 33:13.000]  And best of all, 24-7 support via live chat and email.
[33:13.000 --> 33:18.000]  They don't offer telephone support because who wants to talk on the phone?
[33:18.000 --> 33:22.000]  To me, they actually advertise it as a feature and I agree.
[33:22.000 --> 33:24.000]  If you want to talk live, they've got live chat.
[33:24.000 --> 33:29.000]  If you want to email, they've got email and they're 24-7, 365 days a year.
[33:29.000 --> 33:30.000]  You can always get in touch with them.
[33:30.000 --> 33:35.000]  So while you're working on it, if you hit a wall, if you're confused by something, just dial them up on the chat,
[33:35.000 --> 33:38.000]  they want to talk to you and they'll help you straighten it out.
[33:38.000 --> 33:47.000]  And best of all, it starts at a ridiculous price. It's $8 a month and that includes a free domain if you pay for it for the year.
[33:47.000 --> 33:52.000]  So you can register your domain right through Squarespace, $8 a month.
[33:52.000 --> 33:54.000]  All of our templates are responsive.
[33:54.000 --> 34:01.000]  The website scales to look great on the phone, on tablet, on big 27-inch retina max, iMacs.
[34:01.000 --> 34:05.000]  And every website comes with an online store, commerce.
[34:05.000 --> 34:09.000]  You could set it up to sell stuff right there and it's just built into the price.
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.000]  You don't have to pay extra to turn on this store.
[34:11.000 --> 34:15.000]  So start with a trial with no credit card required, no credit card.
[34:15.000 --> 34:19.000]  You don't have to worry that you give them your credit card and they're going to start billing you.
[34:19.000 --> 34:22.000]  Just go there, sign up.
[34:22.000 --> 34:28.000]  And when you do pay, which would probably be like two weeks later, whenever the demo periods over.
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.000]  Just remember, give the code.
[34:30.000 --> 34:35.000]  You have a new code for this show, the talk show, all one word, the talk show.
[34:35.000 --> 34:38.000]  And you'll get 10% off your first purchase.
[34:38.000 --> 34:41.000]  And then they'll know you came, they'll show your support for the show.
[34:41.000 --> 34:42.000]  They'll know you came from here.
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  So go to squarespace.com slash the talk show.
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  And they'll know you came from here, find out more.
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.000]  And be sure to check out all the new features in version 7.
[34:52.000 --> 34:55.000]  My thanks to Squarespace.
[34:55.000 --> 35:04.000]  All right, so to me that your story about not knowing what to get for your for Hank for a PC is,
[35:04.000 --> 35:09.000]  I feel this is the same way and I feel like it's just one of those.
[35:09.000 --> 35:16.000]  It's a chasm between Apple people and PC people that's only widened over the years.
[35:16.000 --> 35:23.000]  Because to me, one of the great things about being all in on the Apple platform is that it's so easy to know what the best thing to get is.
[35:23.000 --> 35:28.000]  Right. You know, if I want the best iPad, I know to get the iPad air too.
[35:28.000 --> 35:35.000]  And, you know, just decide which color I want, whether I want cellular and, you know, how much storage I want.
[35:35.000 --> 35:39.000]  And that's it. Whereas if I want the best Android tablet, who knows what it is.
[35:39.000 --> 35:44.000]  If I want the best Windows gaming PC, who knows?
[35:44.000 --> 35:51.000]  Yeah, I mean, there's some, like I said, there's a few manufacturers that specialize in that kind of thing.
[35:51.000 --> 36:03.000]  But, you know, you go to Lenovo site too. And I mean, and I kind of leaning towards Lenovo just because, I don't know, I mean, they've heard that they're okay as opposed to some of the rest of them.
[36:03.000 --> 36:06.000]  It seems like a lot of the other ones really have decreased in quality over the years.
[36:06.000 --> 36:11.000]  And, you know, a bunch of people got out of business and people got bought.
[36:11.000 --> 36:23.000]  And the dizzying array of options that you're presented with for just laptops is on just Lenovo site is ridiculous.
[36:23.000 --> 36:26.000]  And I can't make heads or tails of any of this stuff.
[36:26.000 --> 36:31.000]  And then there's a section for, there is a, you know, there's the, it's like a matrix.
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.000]  It's like a product matrix of different numbers.
[36:34.000 --> 36:42.000]  And within those numbers, they'll say one's good for home, one's good for gaming, one's good for business.
[36:42.000 --> 36:49.000]  But I don't know, but then you basically navigate through those numbers and like, that doesn't make any sense to me.
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  I mean, gaming is to me either.
[36:51.000 --> 36:57.000]  Gaming is the only one that makes sense to me because gaming means it's going to have high powered graphics.
[36:57.000 --> 37:03.000]  If they're being honest and saying this one's good for gaming, that's, you know, it's got to be, it means it's good graphics.
[37:03.000 --> 37:13.000]  Or at least gaming optimized graphics because, you know, it's, it's, you know, you could have like a Mac Pro might have very powerful graphics.
[37:13.000 --> 37:20.000]  But it's probably a more, you know, the drivers are more optimized towards professional applications than gaming.
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.000]  Whereas a gaming PC, you know what it means.
[37:22.000 --> 37:28.000]  It means, you know, it's set up for all the stuff on Steam to be optimized, you know, perfectly.
[37:28.000 --> 37:31.000]  But what's the difference between a machine that's good for home and good for business?
[37:31.000 --> 37:36.000]  I get, I mean, I guess that home is mostly just considered email and web surfing.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  And business, I don't know.
[37:38.000 --> 37:39.000]  I don't understand.
[37:39.000 --> 37:43.000]  And business, and I always get the sense that businesses somebody else is paying for this.
[37:43.000 --> 37:46.000]  So this is a more expensive computer.
[37:46.000 --> 37:47.000]  See, I don't know.
[37:47.000 --> 37:58.000]  I kind of feel like it's such an artificial distinction that it dates back to the, you know, like, back to when we were talking with like Word 5 and Word 6, like 1989 and 90,
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  when like business would want like a networking card.
[38:02.000 --> 38:07.000]  Like when it was a card that you actually had to install them in the back of the computer so you could plug Ethernet in or something like that.
[38:07.000 --> 38:11.000]  And an Ethernet card was a couple hundred bucks and it was expensive.
[38:11.000 --> 38:14.000]  And there's no way you'd want that at home because nobody had Ethernet at home.
[38:14.000 --> 38:15.000]  Yeah.
[38:15.000 --> 38:22.000]  And so there were, you know, like physical differences between what you'd want in a business environment than a home environment.
[38:22.000 --> 38:26.000]  Whereas it's a distinction that's meaningless today.
[38:26.000 --> 38:32.000]  I mean, there's a reason why Apple doesn't have business versus home distinctions in any other products.
[38:32.000 --> 38:33.000]  Yeah.
[38:33.000 --> 38:37.000]  Right? There's no business iPhone and business, you know, home iPhone.
[38:37.000 --> 38:41.000]  And in fact, it's the fact that they didn't do that.
[38:41.000 --> 38:49.000]  And they don't have any such distinctions is what's driven this whole, you know, I think revolutionary bring your own device to work.
[38:49.000 --> 38:57.000]  You know, that's really gotten in, you know, gaining momentum in like the biggest and most buttoned up corporate environment.
[38:57.000 --> 38:58.000]  Yeah.
[38:58.000 --> 39:03.000]  I really think, I mean, that whole good, better best thing that they did.
[39:03.000 --> 39:06.000]  What rounds 2000, right, was that?
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  No, I think it was even earlier.
[39:08.000 --> 39:13.000]  Okay, so maybe it started earlier and it went like up to like 2003 or something like that.
[39:13.000 --> 39:16.000]  And then they, I think they started dropping it.
[39:16.000 --> 39:20.000]  It was brilliant. And I think they should, I frankly think they should still do that.
[39:20.000 --> 39:26.000]  I think they do internally, but it's, it's a little bit blurrier, you know, it's.
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  Yeah.
[39:28.000 --> 39:40.000]  Well, any other thing they did was well, they had good better and best, but then they had just had the simple four-way product matrix of pro not pro portable not portable.
[39:40.000 --> 39:51.000]  Yeah. Right. And there was, so there was the not pro portable was the iBook and the pro portable was the MacBook or I guess it was power book then.
[39:51.000 --> 39:58.000]  You know, iMac was the not pro desktop and the power Mac.
[39:58.000 --> 40:02.000]  Power Mac. I was going to say Mac Pro. Right. Power Mac was the pro desktop and that was it.
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  And then within each one, there was good better best. Yeah.
[40:06.000 --> 40:09.000]  So it's a little bit more complicated now, but not too much.
[40:09.000 --> 40:14.000]  I don't think, it's going to be really tough. I have no idea what they're going to do next year with the iPhone.
[40:14.000 --> 40:18.000]  Well, shelf that, that's because I think that that's a deep conversation.
[40:18.000 --> 40:22.000]  That is a deep, I think we should return to it.
[40:22.000 --> 40:30.000]  But I don't think it's hard to go in and buy a MacBook today. I think, you know, you know, it's what would you rather do would you rather, you know, pay.
[40:30.000 --> 40:43.000]  I think it'll get more complex, maybe more complex if the rumored retina MacBook errors are coming as, you know, like in the early months of next year, which I think is probably true.
[40:43.000 --> 40:49.000]  I think if the iMac has gone retina, I think the MacBook error is probably next.
[40:49.000 --> 40:53.000]  And I think suddenly, suddenly that becomes a little tougher decision to make.
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  But that's a transition. Right.
[40:55.000 --> 41:07.000]  And if anything, it's only going to steer more people toward spending a little less and getting the retina MacBook error instead of a retina MacBook 13 inch MacBook Pro.
[41:07.000 --> 41:11.000]  You know, which I think would save people money instead of making people pay more.
[41:11.000 --> 41:12.000]  Right.
[41:12.000 --> 41:15.000]  But it's still right now today though, it's a very easy decision.
[41:15.000 --> 41:24.000]  It's like do you want the really nice machine and yeah, it's going to be a little thicker and heavier or do you want the cheaper lighter one, which is the air?
[41:24.000 --> 41:25.000]  Yeah.
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  It was pretty easy.
[41:27.000 --> 41:35.000]  I mean, knowing the getting my wife a machine was actually relatively simple because she's got a monitor.
[41:35.000 --> 41:36.000]  She's got an external monitor.
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  So she didn't need a huge screen.
[41:38.000 --> 41:44.000]  So 10 inch and definitely the air, obviously.
[41:44.000 --> 41:49.000]  And then it was just storage space and she's got a fairly big iPhone library.
[41:49.000 --> 41:54.000]  So she needed, she couldn't take the 128 gig hard drive.
[41:54.000 --> 42:01.000]  And I was, you know, I think, okay, if you want to get a machine now, it's really makes sense to get eight gigs of RAM instead of four.
[42:01.000 --> 42:02.000]  Yeah.
[42:02.000 --> 42:03.000]  And so that was it.
[42:03.000 --> 42:04.000]  Yeah.
[42:04.000 --> 42:05.000]  That's it.
[42:05.000 --> 42:06.000]  Yeah.
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  There's no other really any other considerations whatsoever.
[42:10.000 --> 42:11.000]  Yeah.
[42:11.000 --> 42:18.000]  And I'm not, you know, and I'm sure that on the flip side, it's like what drive like this conversation of what how great it is that we don't have too many choices to make.
[42:18.000 --> 42:23.000]  Is exactly what drives PC sure PC fans nuts.
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  And they think that Android fans.
[42:25.000 --> 42:26.000]  Right.
[42:26.000 --> 42:38.000]  Because I think they're the same people, you know, I think that, you know, the people who most like the fact that they can can figure can built can still build their own PCs for the desktop.
[42:38.000 --> 42:45.000]  You know, are the sort of people who think it's wonderful that there are so many Android phones to choose from.
[42:45.000 --> 42:46.000]  Yeah.
[42:46.000 --> 42:54.000]  I think was that I'm seriously thinking about like in the next couple of weeks, probably like maybe like maybe like for the month of December.
[42:54.000 --> 43:02.000]  To try, you know, I haven't done it in like two years is give Android a shot and try live in for two weeks with an Android phone.
[43:02.000 --> 43:11.000]  And so I asked around, I was waiting for the Nexus six to ship, which I almost certainly knew I wasn't going to want because it's so huge.
[43:11.000 --> 43:19.000]  But it came out and the reviews came out and a lot of them are really, really bad like Josh Topolsky's, you know, had pictures from it.
[43:19.000 --> 43:27.000]  And he thinks the the camera is actually worse than last year's Nexus five and both of them are way worse than the iPhone camera low light.
[43:27.000 --> 43:29.000]  It's a really shitty camera.
[43:29.000 --> 43:31.000]  And that to me is a deal breaker right there.
[43:31.000 --> 43:32.000]  Right.
[43:32.000 --> 43:49.000]  But it's, you know, so my just basic question to Twitter and to my Twitter followers is, okay, let's say I want to give Android Lollipop, you know, the new 5.0 version of Android, which I do think from the outside not having used it looks like the first one, first version of Android ever that's pretty well designed.
[43:49.000 --> 43:50.000]  Right.
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  So that's why I want to try it.
[43:52.000 --> 44:03.000]  And I have no interest in trying Android four point anything on any phone because I know that I don't like it. I know I've used it. I've spent enough time with Android four devices that I know I don't like the design.
[44:03.000 --> 44:10.000]  So it has to be 5.0, which which phone should I get and it's there's no clear like this is the best one to get.
[44:10.000 --> 44:11.000]  Yeah.
[44:11.000 --> 44:23.000]  Yeah. More or less, it comes down to the two most popular answers were the Nexus five, which is the year old Nexus phone and the Moto X, Moto X is more expensive.
[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  That would be cost me like 500 bucks.
[44:25.000 --> 44:26.000]  No HTC.
[44:26.000 --> 44:27.000]  No HTC.
[44:27.000 --> 44:32.000]  No, because it is TC's M8, which did get some votes.
[44:32.000 --> 44:39.000]  And most of the people who voted for it, you know, said it's easily the best build quality of any Android phone.
[44:39.000 --> 44:48.000]  But all HTC is promised for the M8 is that it'll get lollipop within the next 90 days, which probably means 89 days from now.
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  Yeah.
[44:50.000 --> 44:59.000]  I've talked about my Nexus seven on the show before and it's the original one.
[44:59.000 --> 45:03.000]  And so the other day I thought, you know, because lollipop just came out not that long ago.
[45:03.000 --> 45:11.000]  I thought, Oh, well, maybe I can see if I can get lollipop on that device because it wasn't included in the beta program.
[45:11.000 --> 45:20.000]  Originally, it was the tried it back in the summer and it was not one of the devices that you could install the early release on.
[45:20.000 --> 45:24.000]  And and still there is no release for that device.
[45:24.000 --> 45:25.000]  And how old is that?
[45:25.000 --> 45:26.000]  Which was very confusing.
[45:26.000 --> 45:34.000]  So that's one of that come out two years ago, two and a half years ago, I want to say.
[45:34.000 --> 45:41.000]  Yeah, because it came out the summer before the iPad mini.
[45:41.000 --> 45:53.000]  And it's just it's just a little odd to me that lollipop is quote out, but it's not that they haven't created and apparently they're going to create a build for it, but they haven't done it yet.
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  Yeah, they're not good at stuff like that.
[45:56.000 --> 45:58.000]  And it's from Google.
[45:58.000 --> 45:59.000]  It's a Google.
[45:59.000 --> 46:00.000]  Right.
[46:00.000 --> 46:03.000]  It's a cool device.
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.000]  They're not there.
[46:05.000 --> 46:14.000]  I my broad impression of Google overall, I was I forget I was talking about this on Twitter the other day, but that.
[46:14.000 --> 46:22.000]  It's like one of those adages and I know it's you know it's it's obviously not mathematically true, but you know the first 90% of the effort.
[46:22.000 --> 46:28.000]  It takes half your time and the other 10% takes the other 90% of your time.
[46:28.000 --> 46:38.000]  Yeah, it's that last 10% always is is not really 10% it's really more like half of anything any big project.
[46:38.000 --> 46:44.000]  And Google is really bad at it at going into that.
[46:44.000 --> 46:59.000]  You know, and to me that like that like the hard part and for all the gripes people have about you know like iOS new versions of iOS running poorly on the oldest supported phones, you know or tab or iPads.
[46:59.000 --> 47:05.000]  At least they do run and it's a lot more effort to make that happen than I think people give Apple credit for.
[47:05.000 --> 47:06.000]  Yeah.
[47:06.000 --> 47:13.000]  And it's you know Google just punts on all that usually I mean I'd see our with Android pretty much every every year.
[47:13.000 --> 47:19.000]  Like they've never really had a release that has good support even for their Nexus devices that are more than a year old.
[47:19.000 --> 47:20.000]  Yeah.
[47:20.000 --> 47:24.000]  Because it's hard it's really really hard.
[47:24.000 --> 47:27.000]  And they just don't even try.
[47:27.000 --> 47:35.000]  But the consensus seems to be that if I want the best like the state of the art Android experience today get a Moto X.
[47:35.000 --> 47:41.000]  The the new Moto X because they kept the name the same year of the year.
[47:41.000 --> 47:42.000]  That's interesting.
[47:42.000 --> 47:43.000]  It wouldn't have.
[47:43.000 --> 47:44.000]  It wouldn't have thought that.
[47:44.000 --> 47:45.000]  Yeah.
[47:45.000 --> 47:46.000]  And everybody seems to agree with it too.
[47:46.000 --> 47:54.000]  Like the consensus is it's the best build quality to good you know competitive camera and.
[47:54.000 --> 48:03.000]  Motorola's extension it's not just a pure you know like the way that the Nexus has the pure Google Android experience.
[48:03.000 --> 48:08.000]  Like Android 5.0 with nothing you know unadulterated.
[48:08.000 --> 48:18.000]  That Moto X's version is pretty close to stock and the only thing they really do is they add their own applications as system apps that you can't delete.
[48:18.000 --> 48:25.000]  But they don't change the system itself you know like the notification center looks like the pure Android notification center.
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  You know it's stuff like that.
[48:27.000 --> 48:37.000]  You know it's a lot more it's it's really really close to stock Android with a few Motorola sprinkles as opposed to the HTC and.
[48:37.000 --> 48:40.000]  And Samsung way of sort of getting in at the system level and.
[48:40.000 --> 48:41.000]  Right.
[48:41.000 --> 48:42.000]  Right.
[48:42.000 --> 48:43.000]  I would love to try.
[48:43.000 --> 48:48.000]  Yeah I would too I don't know how you could get your hands on one of them.
[48:48.000 --> 48:49.000]  Yeah and on either.
[48:49.000 --> 48:55.000]  And I from what I've read I suspect that while it would be fun to use it's probably crappy enough that you.
[48:55.000 --> 48:56.000]  Right.
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  You wouldn't want to blow a couple hundred bucks on it because it's you know.
[48:58.000 --> 48:59.000]  Right.
[48:59.000 --> 49:02.000]  But I'd love to see what the user experience I mean what the what the software is like.
[49:02.000 --> 49:07.000]  Yeah because it's substantially different from a look of it.
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  Yeah very very custom.
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  Yeah.
[49:12.000 --> 49:17.000]  And I don't know what's going to have me you know people keep talking about oh look out because.
[49:17.000 --> 49:21.000]  Xiaomi is going worldwide now and I don't know what's going to happen if they.
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  Come to the United States.
[49:23.000 --> 49:24.000]  I don't think they could.
[49:24.000 --> 49:25.000]  Yeah.
[49:25.000 --> 49:31.000]  I don't think they ever will come to any I don't think they're ever going to come to a country with strong IP laws.
[49:31.000 --> 49:32.000]  Right.
[49:32.000 --> 49:33.000]  I really don't I'm going to stick.
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.000]  You know I think they can they can grow.
[49:36.000 --> 49:42.000]  Well they have a lot of room to grow just staying in the Asian countries where they.
[49:42.000 --> 49:48.000]  Because the way that they operate in the way that they so shamelessly copied stuff that I just don't see how they're going to.
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  I just don't see how they can do it.
[49:50.000 --> 49:51.000]  Yeah.
[49:51.000 --> 49:56.000]  I wouldn't think that would they wouldn't be there five minutes before they get.
[49:56.000 --> 49:57.000]  Right.
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  Slapped with a suit.
[49:59.000 --> 50:00.000]  Yeah.
[50:00.000 --> 50:01.000]  Well and let's.
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.000]  Come back when we come back let's talk about.
[50:05.000 --> 50:09.000]  Your thing before about the what Apple will do with the iPhone next year.
[50:09.000 --> 50:10.000]  Okay.
[50:10.000 --> 50:14.000]  So remember that but I'm going to take a break here and thank our next sponsor.
[50:14.000 --> 50:18.000]  Our good friends at Harry's Harry's makes.
[50:18.000 --> 50:24.000]  Really super high quality men's shaving products at extraordinary prices.
[50:24.000 --> 50:29.000]  And they it's a special month this is November but it's in Harry's world.
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  It's November.
[50:31.000 --> 50:32.000]  Have you heard of this November?
[50:32.000 --> 50:33.000]  Yep.
[50:33.000 --> 50:36.000]  So it's a little late now to get started but you know better late than never.
[50:36.000 --> 50:41.000]  But the idea with November is you you you do a full shave you shave your face.
[50:41.000 --> 50:45.000]  And then for the rest of the month you just grow out your mustache.
[50:45.000 --> 50:52.000]  And the idea is when you start to look goofy and people say something to you you mentioned November.
[50:52.000 --> 50:59.000]  And what it is it's it's a you raise money for men's health issues.
[50:59.000 --> 51:05.000]  You know things like getting your get your colon checked and everything like that.
[51:05.000 --> 51:12.000]  So Harry's dot com is the official razor partner of mowvember.
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.000]  And they will be there for the entire Harry month.
[51:15.000 --> 51:18.000]  So whether or not you grow your mow.
[51:18.000 --> 51:27.000]  Well Harry's you can get an amazing shave and do good by supporting mowvember's quest to fund research on important men's health issues.
[51:27.000 --> 51:30.000]  Totally worth checking out really good cause.
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  I mean who's opposed to men's health.
[51:32.000 --> 51:35.000]  I mean it's a great great cause.
[51:35.000 --> 51:38.000]  And again I've said this before.
[51:38.000 --> 51:43.000]  Harry's products are just amazingly amazingly high quality.
[51:43.000 --> 51:47.000]  Really high quality handles high quality blades.
[51:47.000 --> 51:56.000]  I just to me that says it all is that they don't they're not like like white label blades that they put their brands on.
[51:56.000 --> 52:00.000]  They bought their own razor blade factory in Germany.
[52:00.000 --> 52:06.000]  A factory that's been crafting razor blades for almost a century they bought it.
[52:06.000 --> 52:13.000]  And now they make their own and by cutting out that middle man that's that's the main way that they can offer really high quality stuff.
[52:13.000 --> 52:18.000]  A fraction of the price of drugstore brands and it's literally like even if you go to like Amazon.
[52:18.000 --> 52:25.000]  Who is not known for being undercut on prices and you know compare the price of like Harry's blades versus Gillette blades.
[52:25.000 --> 52:28.000]  You know the equivalent number of blades on the thing.
[52:28.000 --> 52:29.000]  It's about half the price.
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  Really really great price.
[52:31.000 --> 52:35.000]  Their starter shave set starts at just 15 bucks.
[52:35.000 --> 52:44.000]  That includes the razor handle three blades in your choice of Harry's shave cream or their new foaming shave gel.
[52:44.000 --> 52:47.000]  I've only ever used the shave cream.
[52:47.000 --> 52:52.000]  I like that stuff but I don't know what kind of shaver you like the foaming.
[52:52.000 --> 52:56.000]  I'm currently I'm actually yeah when I used to use the straight razor.
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  I like the foaming stuff.
[52:58.000 --> 53:02.000]  See I don't like the foaming stuff because I can't see I can't see what's going on.
[53:02.000 --> 53:05.000]  But if you like the foaming stuff they've got that now too with their shave gel.
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  So you get to pick what you want.
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  I just think feels good on your face.
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  I think it's like it's so anyway.
[53:11.000 --> 53:12.000]  Whatever.
[53:12.000 --> 53:13.000]  Yeah to each zone.
[53:13.000 --> 53:16.000]  Yeah my dad always used the foaming stuff.
[53:16.000 --> 53:17.000]  So I don't know.
[53:17.000 --> 53:20.000]  I like the regular shave cream that doesn't really foam up.
[53:20.000 --> 53:26.000]  But anyway you get your pick and they also just released a new after shave moisturizer.
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  They sent me some of that.
[53:28.000 --> 53:29.000]  They just send it.
[53:29.000 --> 53:32.000]  I don't even ask for it but I guess because they sponsored the show they sent me some.
[53:32.000 --> 53:33.000]  Smells really good.
[53:33.000 --> 53:34.000]  I like it.
[53:34.000 --> 53:35.000]  Really high quality stuff.
[53:35.000 --> 53:38.000]  All of their stuff comes in the most amazing packaging.
[53:38.000 --> 53:39.000]  I've said this before.
[53:39.000 --> 53:43.000]  It's like the type of packaging that the pack rat in me doesn't even want to throw away.
[53:43.000 --> 53:47.000]  And it's like then I start thinking myself well no you now you're going to be on a hoarder's show because you're crazy.
[53:47.000 --> 53:50.000]  You're keeping the box with me.
[53:50.000 --> 53:54.000]  You're keeping the cardboard box that your razor blades came in because you like the fonts.
[53:54.000 --> 54:01.000]  Seriously I have to like I have to like do like a double take and then I go to throw it in the trash can.
[54:01.000 --> 54:04.000]  And it's like I can't throw it out.
[54:04.000 --> 54:05.000]  But it's real.
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  That's how good the packaging is.
[54:07.000 --> 54:08.000]  Really great stuff.
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  If you haven't checked them out.

[54:54.000 --> 55:03.000]  Yeah never shaved it with a blade like a I've always used an electric but I should try it with a.
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  But it's a really nice.
[55:05.000 --> 55:08.000]  Clean clean cut.
[55:08.000 --> 55:12.000]  Yeah I don't know how do you don't know how you would you know some people do it.
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  But I know I know ball guys who do it.
[55:14.000 --> 55:17.000]  Right but you can't see I don't know I don't know.
[55:17.000 --> 55:18.000]  I don't know.
[55:18.000 --> 55:19.000]  I'm gonna be pretty.
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  I have a hard skill to get hanged to do it.
[55:21.000 --> 55:31.000]  I have enough I have enough trouble to shave in my face with my decreasing vision and stuff.
[55:31.000 --> 55:34.000]  What I can look at is is hard enough.
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  So next year's iPhones.
[55:36.000 --> 55:39.000]  A lot of people have been talking about this.
[55:39.000 --> 55:44.000]  Is what are they going to do with the four in size is that what you're thinking.
[55:44.000 --> 55:50.000]  Yeah because I've seen a lot of a lot of people have been publishing their whatever like month.
[55:50.000 --> 55:54.000]  A month with the iPhone six plus or a month with the iPhone six.
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  And everybody seems to really like them.
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  I like the device well enough.
[55:58.000 --> 56:07.000]  I've got a six and but but I mostly would mostly like about it is the extra features as opposed to the larger screen.
[56:07.000 --> 56:11.000]  If I could I would actually go back to the four inch.
[56:11.000 --> 56:12.000]  I would too.
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  In fact I did it for two weeks.
[56:14.000 --> 56:19.000]  I went back just to see you know what I thought I actually took my sim card out and went back to my five.
[56:19.000 --> 56:26.000]  I went back to my five S for two full weeks and really liked it.
[56:26.000 --> 56:37.000]  But ultimately went back to the six because I can definitely tell I can absolutely Pepsi challenge the the superior photos, especially indoors.
[56:37.000 --> 56:44.000]  It's possible that outdoors and sunlight I couldn't Pepsi challenge the photos but indoors I can definitely do it.
[56:44.000 --> 56:47.000]  There's so much less noise on the.
[56:47.000 --> 56:58.000]  And brighter brighter exposures in really low light on the six that it's that alone almost makes it seals the deal.
[56:58.000 --> 57:04.000]  I also can tell and this is something I didn't like when I wrote my review of it that I didn't notice and it's a sort of thing that.
[57:04.000 --> 57:12.000]  It's why I wish that I could always take six weeks to write these reviews like I used to before I got the review unit as opposed to doing it in like one week.
[57:12.000 --> 57:21.000]  But like in the first week with it the two new phones I noticed that the screens were nice but I didn't notice that they were actually nicer than the five S like.
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  Yeah I didn't hear.
[57:23.000 --> 57:39.000]  And there's that hole that the big thing that I was obsessed with the first week was the increase in pixels per inch on the six plus that they went to this 19 you know 20 by 1080 resolution and it runs at three X.
[57:39.000 --> 57:47.000]  A retina but on the fly they scale it down to like this weird 2.7 X scaling factor.
[57:47.000 --> 57:55.000]  And I spent the whole week like you know taking my glasses on taking them off getting it you know squinting real close that is trying to see if I could see you know.
[57:55.000 --> 58:07.000]  The scaling and how much nicer and it really the six plus really does look nicer to me like you get really close to it and text looks better because there's more pixels per inch even though they're scaling and it's not true three X it really does look better than two X.
[58:07.000 --> 58:13.000]  And this regular six has the same 326 pixels per inch as the five S.
[58:13.000 --> 58:19.000]  I didn't notice this in the first week with the phone because I was obsessed with just the pixels per inch and the six had the same pixels
[58:19.000 --> 58:42.000]  for the five S so I didn't really bother looking at it too much. But now low these almost what two months later and with me having gone back to the five S for two weeks and now back to the six I can really notice that the six you know the fact that it has the same pixels per inch aside is so much as a really nice improvement to the screen.
[58:42.000 --> 58:50.000]  It I know that they talked about the fact that they added a polarizing filter or a new polarizing filter so it looks better with polarize sunglasses.
[58:50.000 --> 58:58.000]  But I think something to do with that also it that the screen is even closer to the glass than before.
[58:58.000 --> 59:07.000]  It's even you know I know that I raved about it endlessly when they first went retina with the iPhone 4 that it really looked like the the pixels are closer to the glass.
[59:07.000 --> 59:20.000]  But now it's so much closer that it makes like my iPhone 5 look like the screen is too far behind the glass and it even makes all of my iPads everything I look at other than the phone look like the pixels are too too far under the glass.
[59:20.000 --> 59:23.000]  And that's really nice.
[59:23.000 --> 59:40.000]  But bottom line is it's all about the feel in my hand and I like the four inch feel in my hand better I do I use my phone so much at the time that I use my phone I really only have one hand.
[59:40.000 --> 59:53.000]  To get into reach ability I do use reach ability that much you know even though I even though my complaint is about not being able to reach stuff at the top with my grip it never occurs to me.
[59:53.000 --> 1:00:02.000]  So instead of doing this thing where I'm gently palming it right and I have no there's no support at the bottom and I'm reaching across the phone to get to the operating corner.
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  I'm doing it right now which is why my mouth is turning away from the microphone but and I just I know I'm going to drop it at some point because it's not a it's not a secure hold.
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  But reach ability I mean to me it's nice that it's there but it doesn't it often doesn't fire for me on the first try.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  And so then I'm doing this extra thing that it didn't used to have to do and sometimes it's not working and it's not it's not solving the problem for me.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  I just never occurs to me to use it it's it's part of what I love about iOS is even more than Mac OS 10 to me the system makes such a coherent sense the design of the way that you go in and out of apps and navigate within an app.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  It's like I'm in I'm just whenever I'm using my iPhone I'm just in a certain mental zone and it using reach ability takes me out of that you know because it's not on screen like part of what to me the magic of iOS is that everything is on the screen anything you can do is something you can see on the screen.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  And it that's a profound decrease in abstraction like that's why I think that they like the hardware back button that Android uses even though they draw it on screen now you know on most phones.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  But the fact that it's outside the rules of the system it just never occurs to me to use it when I'm using Android and I find it hard to remember that that's what you're supposed to do.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  But the only thing you ever have to do in iOS that's that's hardware related is hit the home button software wise you know and then there's things like volume but that volume makes sense that it's hardware because it's it's not the software you're manipulating it's what they actually you know it makes sense that it's hardware because it's the device that's emitting the sound.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  And using reach ability just takes me outside that zone it feels like it's it's not on the screen right you know if if somehow I could just swipe my thumb down and the phone would magically know that I'm swiping down to read something I'd probably use it all the time.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  Of course no way the phone could read your mind and know that you're swiping down for reach ability as opposed to some other thing yeah you know it's if it could though read your mind in theory you know I mean I know that I'm just saying I would use it all the time I would I would just drag the screen down and you know hit the hit the back button but it's a big issue for me.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  Also I really really don't like the size of it in my jeans and I keep that I don't notice actually I really don't notice the difference there.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  I definitely do I think part of it too is that when I wrote my review in September I was it was still somewhat shorts weather I might have spent more time with shorts I don't know but it's.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  I keep I keep toggling the mute switch as I take it in and out of my jeans.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  I also I just don't like it I even like the flat sides of the iPhone 5s.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  I kind of like that but I also kind of like the new one too I mean I love the feel it's I like the smooth feel to I'll chalk that one up to a wash because if there were in theory a 4.0 inch iPhone 6.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  That had this shape I wouldn't be complaining about it I guess.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  Yeah I wouldn't either.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  But I do think my thing is that I noticed after switching back to the 5s for two weeks that it the flat sides make for a nicer iPhone as camera.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  I'm holding it to take a picture it feels more natural in my hands to have my fingers pinching flat sides right around.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  But I'll call that a wash it's overall though how easy it is to reach everything with holding the phone in one hand and how big it is in my pocket.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  Not last night space age and downloaded that and you know it's nice having a larger screen to play a game.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  But I don't think to me it's not enough it's not you know I have an iPad it's not nice enough on the phone to make the difference for me.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  Yeah no no question when you're using it it's you know there are certainly reasons to to prefer a bigger screen I mean I I watch most most of the in the summer when I'm when baseball seasons in and I watch a.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  Seriously I watch you know I don't know over a hundred Yankee games a year the ones I don't watch on TV I usually watch on my iPad but I wind up just for convenience sake.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  Sometimes watching them on my phone and obviously watching something that's the equivalent of TV like a ball game the bigger the screen the better you know right even the six plus is better.
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:10.000]  You know but that's to me isn't important enough to optimize which phone I get.
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  If there were a 4.0 inch iPhone six like a third size zero hesitation a hundred percent certainty that's the one I would have bought. Yeah me too. Well I think I mean at this at this point I wanted to try it.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  Try the bigger size and see if I liked it better but I've come to the conclusion that I don't.
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  All right it's not even it would be it's an easier decision than almost any other in the Apple product line and no hesitation I think the iPhone six is I don't and I.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  Here's the big here's the thing that I think it's loss in this is that people who love.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  Big phones and I know that they truly do there are people who love the five the six plus you know.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:06:00.000]  Whatever reason they seem to. As a group to lump them all together they seem to think.
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:09.000]  Just unilaterally big phones are better and you know now that now that the iPhone has bigger screens iPhone users will see what they've been missing out on the years.
[1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:13.000]  Everybody will see it and we'll get to you know we'll appreciate it.
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  I don't doubt that they're right but I really do think though that there are you know I'm certain now having used it for this bunch and having gone back that you know it's the the scale of form factors that people want in phones definitely goes.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  Beneath 4.7 inches for you know so my my my short version is not that the iPhone six is too big it's that it's too big to be the smallest iPhone.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  You know not that I'm doubting that there are some people who love this size and that it's perfect for them so what are they going to do next year yeah.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  I don't know I would be surprised if they don't update the that that the four inch form factor though what I hope they do is is expand the top of the line.
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  You know which would be next year I would expect an a nine system on a chip and you know and even better camera.
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  I would it's what I hope they do is expand to three sizes and that they you know whatever they call it you know.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  Yeah if it's may I don't know if they're going to stick with this thing where they you know use use the same you know if next year's 4.7 inch is exact same physical sizes this and they call it the six S.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  And they call the other one the six S plus and they fit the same cases and maybe they just update the colors of the metal to show that the new ones.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  And introduce I don't know an iPhone six air call it the iPhone six air and make it the four inch size.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  With like I said what I would hope for is they would have the a nine and the new camera and all that.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  But well I think it'll have Apple pen matter what what I think is more likely.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  Is that they would make it do it sort of like they did the five C. Two years ago.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  And that the for it this is what I think is more likely that the four inch size there will be a new phone.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  But it'll be like the five C might be even might even be plastic.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  And would have the internal specs of these phones.
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  Thus a eight eight these 2014 and I have dead of the nine.
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  Yeah and the camera from this phone.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  And and it would be you know $100 lower starting price than the six S.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  Yeah that sounds more likely to me.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  I think it's way more likely because I think they have to they can't price it equivalent they can't make.
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  Yeah I think you know well the screen the screen size alone isn't enough for it to warrant a hundred dollar difference.
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  Right you know that that's it would they be eating into their profit margins too much.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  You know that you know they can't just a you know wouldn't cost them a hundred dollars less to do it.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  So I think it would be more likely that it would be like the six C the iPhone six C.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  And it would be four inches but it would be a year behind on the specs.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  And the plastic seems to belong at the bottom of the line though.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  Because what happens then I mean you can't you can't then take the five S and move it down to the free model and have a plastic.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  I guess you could but the screen size is the same.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  I mean that's what they did with the five.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  They had the four S when the five C came out at the bottom.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  But that was a different screen size.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  It seemed like they could push down I mean maybe they could just make a new.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  I don't know if new five C.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  So then the bottom two would be both plastic.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  Yeah something like that I don't know.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  But that's what I worry that they're going to do.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  And I worry that on the CPU side I would probably would just prefer size alone.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  And I'll take the year olds CPU specs and get the smaller one.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  But I very much worried that the camera in next year's iPhone will be so much better again than this year's that even though I'm so impressed this year with this camera.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  I think next year's camera is going to be so much better that I won't that I'll be stuck getting the 4.7 and 20 again for the camera.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  Even though I would take the year old A8 because I don't really play a lot of games and stuff like that.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  I don't know that getting it improved A9 would mean that much to me.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  But the improved camera would.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  Yeah.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  I mentioned this a few episodes ago but I don't have any firm thing about it.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  But I heard like a rumor of a rumor from a like a birdie who knows a birdie like way distant.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  But that well number one it's it's not looking at every single year the camera's gotten better on the iPhone.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  I think except for the first except for the 3G.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  The 2008 iPhone had the same camera as the original 2007 like still didn't shoot video still was really look like a phone camera.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  Ever since the 3GS every single year the iPhone camera has gotten noticeably better like enough better that it was the camera alone was tempting to be the reason that you upgrade every single year.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  At least if you care about photography.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  And so there's no reason to think that's going to stop anyway.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  But the specific thing I heard is that there it's like next year's camera might be like the biggest camera jump ever that they've got like that.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  Really? Yeah that it's I don't even know I don't even know what census makes but that I've heard that it's it's some kind of weird two lens system or like the back camera uses two lenses and I don't know somehow that it takes it up into SLR quality imagery.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  And I don't know that well and in some ways that and that's what I've heard but it can't really mean SLR quality because a lot of what makes SLR or and in the digital age the four thirds cameras which aren't SLR but you know what big what it means is big sensor and a lot of what makes a big
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  cameras with big sensors have better imagery is is physics you know there's physics involved and you have to really have to have the lenses right right.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  But that there's something they could do with two lenses I don't know that just makes the photos if not at a technical level SLR quality but at a practical level for consumers taking pictures.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  I don't know but that it's a big enough jump that anybody who cares about the photography even if you really want a four inch phone again you're going to get the 4.7.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  Yeah I feel like the last two cameras have been plenty of camera for me I'm not as big a camera buff as you are and for years it did seem like yeah okay okay I'm basically taking pictures with this because it's the one that's in my pocket and I don't I don't be like that anymore like it's.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  It's practically speaking caught up to almost everything that I need.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  Yeah it's just they've gotten so good.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  Yeah.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  It's I'm you know and I'm a guy who's you know every every couple not every year like every couple years I'll drop 800 or a thousand dollars on a camera.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  And I really do care about some of that stuff and I really I could just see looking at my you know like my lightroom archive that every year it's more and more or less and less
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  photos shot with anything other than the iPhone.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  Yeah.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  It's you know it's always it just gets more and more even like on vacation and I have the camera camera camera with me and it's like I don't feel like walking around with that in my neck I'll just use my iPhone.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  But I do I think I think the camera is what it's going to come down to for me next year.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  Unless they do what I really really hope they do is put you know put three phones at the top of the.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  Yeah and I would be what I would hope to but I don't think they will I agree.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  Yeah.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  But I still think I would probably like I would probably go back to you know stick with this relatively same internals as this phone in a four inch screen.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  Yeah.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  I think if the camera isn't vastly improved if it's you know I would be very tempted just to get that phone.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  I noticed too and here's the other anecdotal thing is like two or three weeks ago there was a little a small indie Mac conference here in Philly coco love.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  I didn't speak at it but I went to it and you know you know 150 you know Mac nerds iOS development.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  You know some friends Marco was here Dave Dave Wiscus and Brent were here but I mean I met a lot of new people to I don't really get out much so even a local people where a lot of them were new to me.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  And people noticed that was that was it occurred during that two week stretch where I went back to my 5s and a lot of people noticed that I was using the 5s and specific you know and they asked.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  And every almost every single person who I talked to about it was like nodding their head in agreement.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  That yeah I you know and a lot they were all people who had the 6 not the 6 plus and all were thinking the same thing that I love so much about this new phone except that it's bigger.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  Yeah so there's definitely and it's not just you and I are not outliers like we may not be the majority like the the the split across the product line may not be one third one third one third if they did this but I think that it's I think it's maybe close to at least a quarter of people would prefer the foreign size.
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  So I mean I talked to I mean it seems like most of the people is octave actually are you know so I've got a friend who who has giant of incised mid hands.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  And so he got a 6 plus and he feels like he's home because you know he had a 4 which was they so he was like waiting you know thinking they're going to make a new they're going to make one it's bigger and I'm going to wait for that and so he got the 6 plus when I came out and he's he's just like.
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  For him but I don't like our neighbor up the street was we were talking well before the phone these phones came out she said she said it's going to be bigger only like I've got a 4 I don't even want a bigger phone than this.
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  You know my mom is on a 3GS and I keep saying when you get a new phone you need to get a new phone was like she's not even getting software updates anymore and and then it was like okay well if I can't want to get what should I get only like well I guess you should get the.
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  It's like I don't want a huge phone so I guess you should get the the 5 s and and my wife same thing is like she's like I don't want that big a phone I just don't want it that big so all the people I know who were in the market right now are not terribly excited about the larger form factor.
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  I you know and I think it's I think it's a complicated product marketing problem you know where I think part of it clearly there are people I've said I mean I know this that there are people who love like your big handed friend who love the 6 plus.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  And I know that there are people with tiny hands who love the 6 plus you know there are you know there and I know you know I'm talking to Ben Thompson huge every every woman in Asia.
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  As a big like fabulous size 6 inch phone and they were all all of them who wanted an iPhone were all waiting for the 6 plus and and you know it's almost like for some of the people like women with really small hands.
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  Not just an issue it's not just appealing to people with large hands it's you know it's across the board some people just use their phone to hand it all the time and if so, why not get the biggest one.
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  It's not just nerds either such as me like Amy who uses her iPhone very differently from me she's nowhere near she's not on anywhere near as much as I am. But she she doesn't like the 6 size either she thinks it's ridiculously big.
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  And she can't even she really can't even believe that there's a bigger size.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  It's pretty astounding when you see it for the first time yeah.
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  It's a lot of them it you know what and it's funny it's funny because I even had one as a review unit and I used it for a week.
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  But at the the cocoa love conference you know when everybody had it I found everybody had them out all the time and there were people of course not just the people who you know who are nodding their head in agreement with me that the 6 is too big but there were of course other people who had the 6 plus and you see them with it it's like wow.
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  Yeah it's a big asphalt yeah I don't know I'll never get over it yeah I got my I've got my 4 my old 4 sitting here and it just feels really good.
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  I do I love the 4 that small.
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  Yeah just that feels like a phone to me.
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  Yeah that had a good feel I like the 5S to 5S bottom line for me the 5S is at this point peak iPhone that it's actually to me overall right the overall you know like best iPhone ever made to me is the 5S.
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  Yeah I agree I agree because the 5 was was the right form factor but it got dinged up badly it wasn't as it was nice a build.
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  Right.
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:20:06.000]  Hey let's take another break here and thank another long time friend of the show are good friends at back place.
[1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:23.000]  Back place is unlimited unthrottle backup for your Mac online backup you sign up for back place you get this software to install in your Mac written by former engineers at Apple really really good software nice interface easy to understand.
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:41.000]  And runs very very quietly in the background doesn't you never know when it's on or not and what does it do it just backs up everything on your Mac to their cloud servers and if you have external drives you think well it's only going to back up my internal drive no backs up all of them.
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  And you think well but I've got a four terabyte drive is never going to back up that what's the limit no it's unlimited now might take a long time for that first backup for terabytes if you build up a drive for terabytes going up through you know the upstream and your Internet might take a couple days might take over a week but once it's backed up everything after that is incremental.
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  And it just runs after that and then what what's on everything you have on your computer is in their system and it's such a remarkable piece of mind.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  To know that you've got a backup that's offsite so if your house catches on fire and your home office burns up and your backup drive your time machine drive gets burned up along with your computer or your house gets burgled and somebody comes in and rips you off steals your stuff.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  Your stuff your data at least is still somewhere safe and you can do things like use their iPhone app to access one file like you're away from your computer.
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  And you just want to get this one file you know is on your computer you can use the back blaze app login go to where that file is and send it to send an email with that is an attachment from your iPhone from anywhere.
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  If you want to access everything you want to you need a full restore you're you didn't have any other backup your hard drive seized up.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  You know the the disk utility can't fix it you think oh my god my whole thing is busted.
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  You can go there and what you can do at a very low price just pretty much the cost of the hardware is you can have everything on your stuff put onto a USB hard drive and then they'll just mail it to you.
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  So like two three days later back blaze sends you a USB hard drive with a full restore of everything from your system and you've lost nothing.
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  Can't say enough how great the services I recommend it to everybody.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  What do they have it is the stats 100 petabytes of data backed up on their in their system and one petabyte is a thousand terabytes.
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  So that's how much they have overall from all their users.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  No add on no gimmicks no additional charges it's just five bucks per month per computer.
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  So every Mac you have you spend five bucks a month for each one and you have unlimited backup for it.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  It's an unbelievable price.
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  Risk free no credit card required for the trial just go here go back blaze dot com slash daring fireball.
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  Back blaze dot com slash daring fireball and sign up and they'll know you came from the show.
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  If you haven't done it yet honestly I this is the one sponsor above all others that I almost wish that they would stop sponsoring because everybody who listens to the show would just sign up for it.
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  But apparently every time they they sponsor to show more and more people sign up but I don't know who you are who haven't signed up yet but do it because I don't want you to lose your data.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  Can't recommend them strongly enough.
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  All right what else is going on.
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  I don't want to talk about your book.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  No that's fine we were talking about I was talking about having to use word.
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:53.000]  Yeah and that's what I was going to ask about that.
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  Well here's the deal you have you ever written a book before.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  No so you've written your first book.
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  We're part of my first but it's a co-authored.
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:09.000]  All right so it's tell me off and two other fine authors James Clark and Corey dustman.
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  And we have written the visual guide to minecraft for peach pit press or good friends at peach pit press.
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  And it's a getting started book for people who are interested in getting into minecraft or interested in learning a little bit more about some things like.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  How to build houses how to use redstone redstone is really kind of an amazing thing if you haven't gotten into redstone and minecraft.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  There's a good section on how to use redstone.
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  You're laughing because I don't know what it means.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  I think redstone is the stuff that.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  Jonas called me over one day and he said here watch this and he had a thing and he pulled a lever and then a fuse left let off.
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  And like a fuse burned and then he had like a fireworks show ready to go he.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  Yeah that was probably there was probably some redstone anything you're using a lever is probably.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  Probably redstone.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  I mean the great the cool thing about redstone is it kind of teaches it particularly for kids teaches it's like it's almost like programming.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  Because they're they're gates.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  So you can set up a series of different gates and by using these gates you're basically using it's basically the same.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  Fundamental theory that is inside every computer.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  All right it's logic.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  Right.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  Like you know, ants and orson stuff like that.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  Yeah.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  And you know and one day can't come to me he's like I you know I saw this thing on you know as usual on YouTube.
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  And somebody had made an elevator in Minecraft using redstone.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  And he's like I want to make this thing but I can't figure out because you know,
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  most of these YouTube videos are created by a lot of them are created by like 14 year olds or you know.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  People who don't necessarily have the best video production skills and our and presentation skills.
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  And this guy was better than the most but he also got like halfway through and realized that he had screwed something up and just like trying to collect them a fly.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  Which is so it was pretty aggravating for me having to put that thing together but we got through it and we got it done.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  Anyway, so some of that stuff is in the is in the book.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  My section is that I got the beginning section which is how to you know basic game installation and using the interface and then also surviving surviving your first day.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  Which if you're first you know that for me that was like the hard part getting into the game was like okay you just get dropped into this world and there are no instructions really whatsoever.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  And it's like so what am I supposed to do how do I.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  How do I move around here one of my what's my what's my goal here and so I talk about that and then do some basic introduction and like in how to set up a server.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  I did that section and how to install mods now your section is also available as its own standalone book.
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  Yeah all of the section you know all of them are so you know if you if you go so you can go to peach pit press and and it's peach pit dot com and look at like up the visual guide to Minecraft and you can get any of the.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  The sections separately as as ebooks or you can get the book and we're also we're also doing some video stuff that goes along with that so you buy the book.
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  You'll get access to that once it's available it's not quite up yet.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  So that's why you bad mouth the 14 year olds who make the you're saying you're saying that the videos that accompany the visual guide to Minecraft are are.
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  They don't get halfway through and realize that they hadn't set up the right.
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  Yeah the bottom of the elevator that's right that's right in fact they made me do over some.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  Yes that I did.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  It's a good time which is an interesting which was it and so we talked about like computer performance like gaming performance on laptops and so I have my my regular machine is a 2012.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  10 inch 11 inch whatever is air with four megabytes of ramp or megabytes yeah four megabytes of RAM it's a special order.
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  Four gigs of RAM it's a 1991.
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  That book there.
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  What was those little things that you could dock into the.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  Oh yeah anyway and I had done some screen capture stuff before.
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  I thought okay that's it won't be a problem but when you're but it's one thing to do like screen capture stuff of just like web browsing or moving files around in the finder.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  When you're playing a game and you're also running screen capture you know like a fairly processor intensive game like Minecraft and also trying to run screen capture stuff where it's a problem.
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  So the fan was going things were slowing down and it was it was not working right so I actually had to get Hank's MacBook Pro has eight gigs of RAM and that was the that was the most powerful.
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  The most ram that we had in the house so I had to borrow Hank's.
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:13.000]  Hank's MacBook Pro to actually do the video production for this thing.
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  How did you get started on this like how did who whose idea was it to write this book.
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  The basic idea though is that it dummy like me who's been blabbering on this show for months now about being not understanding what the hell Minecraft is.
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:30.000]  This is I just started the book I got it last night.
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  But it seems to me like at the very least it's going to answer the basic question of what the hell is going on.
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  Right.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  Which is really what I want so I cannot tell you how happy I am that this book exists.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:49.000]  I honestly I'm this is like the the book of the year for me because I it is a major part of my life.
[1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:53.000]  This game because you know I love my son and I'm really parent.
[1:29:53.000 --> 1:29:58.000]  Yeah and I'm really it's like the first time he's really gotten into something.
[1:29:58.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  Computer like that he's more into Minecraft than anything else he's ever been into and so I want to be a part of that.
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:10.000]  And I almost feel like I feel like I'm the dad who never played sports and my kid wants to play baseball.
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:16.000]  And now you're telling me that you've got to run around these bay I don't even understand you know that's how I feel about Minecraft.
[1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:24.000]  Yeah like the dad who grew up in England and therefore never never heard of baseball you know and now I live in the United States and my kid wants to play baseball.
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  Right.
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:26.000]  Right.
[1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  Yeah so how did you how did you get involved with this?
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  So well he I mean he so he had a he's got a buddy who got him into Minecraft.
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  You know just like I got to play Minecraft for my car so so he started playing Minecraft like a couple of years ago now I think.
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  And you know and I same thing I just like watched it from afar and then thought oh yeah actually I should you know.
[1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:53.000]  He was looking for someone else to play with and so I thought okay I'll I'll start playing but then I had that you know that reaction like that first like I don't know what the heck I'm doing.
[1:30:53.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  So I actually watched a YouTube video that said here's how to you know like what you should try and do on your first day.
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  And and then we played it for so he probably played it for at least a few months so I played it for like a year and a half or something like that.
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:16.000]  And last spring I wrote that article for the magazine about.
[1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:17.000]  Right.
[1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:36.000]  The basically the mogles of Minecraft YouTube world about that guy stamping and diamond minecart and other people who are making ridiculous amounts of money doing these videos these let's play videos of Minecraft on YouTube.
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:38.000]  Who's trying to get to the end of the universe?
[1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:41.000]  I don't know I don't remember that guy's name.
[1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  Right.
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:51.000]  But yeah there's like there's just there's so many people who are making Minecraft and some of these guys make very good money doing it.
[1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:54.000]  And just from the YouTube.
[1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:55.000]  Just from the YouTube.
[1:31:55.000 --> 1:31:56.000]  Yeah yeah yeah.
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:57.000]  Right.
[1:31:57.000 --> 1:32:10.000]  So that guy stampede of trying to remember his name off top my head Joseph Joseph Garrett.
[1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  And they estimated that it grosses between eighty thousand and eight hundred thousand dollars a month doing these videos.
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:34.000]  And Google takes a cut of that they take like forty five percent and then his network that he works with that does promotion for him takes a cut of that so he's not he's not netting that but still.
[1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:40.000]  But his operation as an operation though adding between thirty thousand and three hundred thousand dollars a month.
[1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:42.000]  Well I can't believe Google takes that much.
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:43.000]  Yeah apparently.
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  I guess I can.
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  Yeah it's something like that. I mean I may not have the exact number but it's in that range.
[1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:51.000]  I don't know.
[1:32:51.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  Thirty percent seems like the gentleman's cap.
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:32:55.000]  Yeah.
[1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:56.000]  You know like.
[1:32:56.000 --> 1:32:57.000]  Right.
[1:32:57.000 --> 1:33:01.000]  You know I mean like everybody can complain that Apple takes thirty percent and I know Amazon has some things where they take thirty.
[1:33:01.000 --> 1:33:10.000]  It just seems like thirty percent is the gentleman's cap for you know slicing off a top of every dollar that comes through your corporate thing.
[1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:13.000]  Anything more than that seems a little outrageous.
[1:33:13.000 --> 1:33:15.000]  But anyway keep going.
[1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:20.000]  So Cliff Colby who is a guy works at.
[1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  Peach Pit and I have known him for years and we talked years that when I was writing crazy upper rumors we talked about like doing a book but I could never get my act together and couldn't figure out what the heck to write.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  And so Cliff saw that article and he's like hey you know I think we should do a Minecraft book and and get some other people to do.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  Some different sections and be relatively easy to put together so.
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  Let's do it.
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  So he so when we talked to WWC when I was down there in San Francisco which is where their where Peach Pit is based and basically wrote it over the summer and into the fall.
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  And then did the video production.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  How big how big is your section.
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:11.000]  I think my sections about forty plus pages forty to fifty pages something like that.
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  So it's not.
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  Not huge.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  No.
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  No it's not huge.
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  Right.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  But it takes time.
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  So it's an interesting it's an interesting process and all of it you know all of it in word.
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  Which is not my.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  I would that's one of the points that he more.
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  I mean I used to be okay on it but you know they they do these people book production companies they they really.
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  There's all in on work.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  Yeah it's not just well we need we just all need to agree on a file format that we all can read it's because they're like the change tracking.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  Yeah it's mostly I think the probably the biggest thing is the train change tracking and then after that it's formatting.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  Stuff I don't because they have all these so they have all their their templates built into.
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  Word already so they provided me a template and I typed into the template and.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  Then you know I would use they had macros that would do formatting stuff.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  So yeah it's I mean that part I'm curious about I'm curious because I am a writer I have written a lot.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  I think I think I I did a word count I exported everything from Daring Fireball before XOXO.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  I didn't actually include this in my talk but because my talk at XOXO was about what it's like to have written Daring Fireball you know how I built it into a business and you know last 12 years or whatever.
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  But I was curious because Jim Koodle asked me a couple months ago he was like what did how much have you written it Daring Fireball I never counted before so I wrote a script I exported everything from the linked list and from my articles and I wrote a script that cut out all the block quoted material so the block quotes didn't count.
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  And it was remarkably even it was a little bit over 900,000 words for both linked list entries in my like column link entries.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  So it's you know close to looks like maybe like within the next year I'll cross like the two million words mark which sounds like a lot of words.
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  That's a lot of that is a lot of words it really does it's not sounds like about it.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  Right and the basic I have a Google this many times but the you know books obviously very great with greatly in length but like the typical length of a book is somewhere around like 60 to 80,000 words.
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  You know for like a novel or something like that.
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  So it's you know like the equivalent of a lot of books yeah but on the other but I've never written I've never written anything in my life that's more than maybe 4,000 words.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  And I don't know that I can like I eat when I was younger I used to think well eventually you'll have to write a book because that's if you want to be a writer of ultimately you think you got to you got to write a book.
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  But you know I don't know I'm getting pretty old and I haven't read the book. It's really just I mean particularly for something like this it's just it's like you're writing a series of articles.
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  You know I wrote different I wrote a number of different sections about different topics and so each one was it's own little thing.
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  I also think though and I don't want to be too much like the princess and the pea but I don't know that I could bring myself to working with word.
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  And that sounds for my struggles with my hardware over the video production part which is really just my own fault.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  The the word part is was not my favorite.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  I you know I'm so picky about what I write that I invented a thing that people use I invented markdown specifically because I wasn't happy with what happened before that you know I can't imagine writing anything long form not marked down.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  And it seems like writing in markdown and then going and you know moving it into word would be such a huge pain in the ass.
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  It is I tried that at first because once you do it working right and it doesn't work because once you have to make edits you can't go back right because that's actually you know like to go back 10 years because I think we're.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  I think this fall is the 10 year anniversary of markdown 1.0 but the public beta came out like in February so we're past 10 years of like public markdown.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  So before markdown was markdown it was.
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  It was a series of filters I had in BB at it that were like one way like I would start by writing markdown like a very prototypical early version of markdown that was mostly just like automatically putting paragraph tags in between blank lines and you know asterisks for italics and some kind of shorthand for links.
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  So I would write that way and then I would run my you know I didn't even name for it but I would run the script and it would turn it into HTML and then I would copy and paste the HTML into movable type.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  But that grew it didn't last long because I would think I was done with the article but then it's like no I'm not really I have thought of something new and I want to go back but it's too late because now it's already an HTML and I'm stuck writing HTML which is the whole reason I started writing the script in the first place to let me use asterisks and stuff like that.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  And it would be even worse I think it would be even worse to do it with something that's rich text like like word.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  And then when I got to the point where I went I went to move the first section into word I was like okay this is not going to work at all.
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  So you're own book you wouldn't yeah and you don't need to use right right I don't have to you know go to someone like peach pet and use their existing process I mean I'm sure that there's obviously a way that I could I could just self publish my own book at this point and I can do pretty well but I mean I would be surprised if David Sparks actually writes in word.
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  Yeah I shouldn't yeah I don't want to be the guy to talk to you it would actually almost be a hypocritical since he's you know he's written a really really good markdown book would be kind of a critical if you hadn't written it in markdown.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  See I think he uses I books author rusty has recently so what would be the point I should find there would be no point going to word.
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  I'm trying to bulk up the show notes and I've noticed that a lot of the podcasts I like have these copious show notes that are you know just my links that's my value add to the two podcasts that I'm on and I all I suffer from podcast amnesia as soon as I'm done recording a podcast I don't even remember what they talked about well I have to listen to it again.
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  See that's the only way the only way I can do it all right but anyway I'll put a link to but I wouldn't even be surprised I did read this book but maybe I have vague recollection that maybe he even included something about how he wrote the book.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  You know his production, you know yeah the other person who might know serenity called well. She knows very well versed in I think she knows more about a book in two notes than anybody.
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  More than serenity I'd like to meet them yeah I remember her her singleton talk from two years ago about the the nitty gritty details of trying to write trying to create an e-book just for like just for like.
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  Epub and Kindles Moby and it was like oh my god what a nightmare yeah like if you thought it was bad back in the days we had a special case internet explorer and that's gate but it's like imagine if one uses HTML and one doesn't even use it to.
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  So anyway anyway now you use word right well my well my I've I've used word my license is now laps since I'm done writing I don't even know what I don't know what it's later I'll get the license again but.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  I don't even know what word looks like these days is it is it the case does everybody pitch pit use max doesn't matter is it is like word at a state.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  I don't think they all use max I don't.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:43:02.000]  We were so the two people that I worked with the peach pit were cliff who was really basically putting the deal together you know bringing the people together and then we had sort of a project manager who I think is actually not a peach pit.
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:13.000]  You know employee someone that they contract with so and I'm pretty sure she did not use a Mac but I think cliff definitely uses a Mac.
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:18.000]  So I think it's there I think they're probably I bet it's a mixed environment.
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  I think I would think that most of the I don't know I don't know actually.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  It seems like a lot of this stuff must end up going to Adobe at some point right.
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:36.000]  I would guess yeah I would guess that the book is I probably actually laid out within design.
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  At least the print book right.
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  I don't know it just seems it's I don't know but there you know the other thing I'll mention while we're promoting you know the book if you go to peach pit to buy your book they have a really sweet deal where you can get the print version.
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  And a package of eBooks epub which works in iBooks Moby which will work on any of your kindles you know either your app or your actual Kindle device and a PDF.
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  And they're not like DRM or anything like that they just put a watermark on it that you know is registered to your name so that you know if you share it you would be you wouldn't be tempted to share it publicly publicly shamed.
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:26.000]  Right and bro I'll probably take into prison.
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  But which is to me the best way to do eBooks you know and I know there's other companies like O'Reilly that do that and I know that our friends that take control of the tidbits folks you know that they they send their you know their breaks are all cross platform and no DRM and stuff like that.
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  But that's the best deal in my opinion.
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  Twenty one dollars fifty nine cents and you get it all yeah which is a really good deal.
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  And just to be clear but we wrap it up that when you go if you go to like the iBooks store and search for multi minecraft two books show up.
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  Nice work I'm trying to help you out here trying to.
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  You search for multi minecraft two books show up and one's more expensive than the other that's because the one that's more expensive is the one with all three of your contributions and don't buy both because your book is just the introduction.
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  Just the introduction section of the yes so I might for my my sections the first section of the whole book right right.
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:24.000]  Let's take a break I have one more sponsor to thank.
[1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  And then we'll wrap up the show but I want to say thanks to our next sponsor and it's our good friends at igloo.
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  igloo is an internet you'll actually like that's their slogan I say it's the internet you'll actually like because I've never heard of another one.
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:55.000]  It's built with easy to use apps like shared calendars Twitter like micro blogs file sharing task management and more it's everything you need for a team to work together better in one very configurable cloud platform.
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  They have a great mobile story their mobile responsive design works like a champ on virtually any device any device with a web kit browser like Android iOS.
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:17.000]  Even the new blackberries windows phone they don't have web kit but you know the mobile internet explorer is really pretty good on windows phone.
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  Responsive design on all those devices works on your new plus sized iPhone right from the start because that's to me one of the little ironies of the whole bigger iPhone screen thing is that well designed responsive mobile mobile apps supported the new sizes automatically and didn't have to be redesigned like like native apps didn't.
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:50.000]  You can review documents post project updates change administrative settings you can even complain about the you two album on your iTunes live.
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:59.000]  All from your phone from your phone you don't have to be at a PC and using a full screen browser all of that stuff works from your phone.
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  Here's the other thing they want me to talk about again I mentioned this the last time this sponsored to show I don't I don't really know much about the enterprise I've never worked in the enterprise but this is a big deal this gardener magic quadrant report.
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:22.000]  Just earlier this month gardener released their 2014 edition of this and it's their magic quadrant for social software in the workplace and this is a big deal for corporate environments.
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:26.000]  For the six consecutive year igloo was listed.
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  Alongside right alongside tech giants like Microsoft IBM Google VM where sales force and SAP all these big companies you know these big huge conglomerate type companies like sales force.
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  And SAP right alongside them is our little friends at igloo because their their product stands right up with those guys really does.
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  So the gardener report values things like the size of the vendor gardener calls that viability.
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  And igloo is praised by gardener for their responsiveness and customer experience here's an excerpt right from gardeners profile.
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  They said feedback from igloo's reference customers was consistently positive they praise the products quick deployment configuration and customization flexibility with self service options for non technical users control over branding and information organization and ease of use they also praise the responsiveness of igloo as an organization.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  So more or less bottom line that's that's gardener verifying and vouching for exactly what what I've been telling you about igloo all along ever since igloo became a darn fireball sponsor.
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  It's easy to use it's easy to understand it's easy for non technical people to set up like the person in charge of the igloo internet for your team doesn't have to be a web programmer doesn't have to be a system administrator.
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  It's just someone who can figure out a really easy to use visual interface for doing this.
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:49:03.000]  Really really great product they're they're growing like gangbusters because it is so much easier and it really is.
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  It's the sort of internet that you'll actually use you know all their competitors the stuff like from Microsoft SharePoint and all that crap people if your team uses that there's evidence that shows that what people on your team really do is they don't use it and they just pass everything around by email.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  igloo is an internet that your team will actually use and best of all this to me is still amazing it's if free to use in perpetuity with up to 10 people.
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  So if you have a 10 person or fewer team igloo is a free product you just use it for free and then after that you can pay at a very very competitive price per user after that.
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  So if you're a small team you can use it for free in perpetuity and if you're a bigger team you can start using it try using it see if everything I've said is true for free.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:49.000]  And then add people after that.
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  So where do you go to find out more easy go to www dot igloo software dot com slash the talk show all one word igloo software dot com slash the talk show.
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  My thanks to igloo.
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  Yeah, someone who has used corporate intranets.
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  I mean I and I have used igloo as well just as a as a user on my own not within the corporate environment but it's such a dirty word that it's really like their whole marketing is just based on we know you hear intranet and think big pile of crap.
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  We're not that that's like rewriting their marketing that we know that when you hear that word you think oh god.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  Yeah, well it's it's just so it's so awful that so much corporate software is so bad.
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  And this is an instance where it's corporate software you know software that you can use in an enterprise instance that is really good in a pleasure to use.
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  Speaking of writing long form writing and using mark down you know where it's really taking off and I'm fascinated by it is with screenplay authors people who write movies there's there's two apps called one's called slug line.
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  The stew mash which is one of the people behind that and then there's high land which is from John August's app company.
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  High land I think started more as like a viewer.
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  That's John August's company is quote unquote apps.
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  They don't use mark down mark down they use the john and stew and a couple other people collaborated with like a tiny like like a one percent sprinkling of a little bit from me a couple years ago.
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  But they started with mark down and they instead made like a mark down like syntax they call fountain and it uses like the dot fountain file extension.
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  Optimize specifically for the rules of screen place you know what a screenplay looks like yeah there's yeah it's kind of that and years ago I used and I tinkered around with whatever that that heavy duty.
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  Final cut final cut final draft final draft yeah yeah and then you know and I've also used scrivener which has some screenplay stuff it you know you can do you can.
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  Do that in scrivener as well final draft is the Microsoft word of screenplay writing it's the 800 pound gorilla on the market it is tons of features and the features help drive it and.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  You know the file format is sort of a standard and people hate it or at least people like like for the read you know there's some people who love Microsoft word I'm not saying again it's the same thing with the phone sizes I'm not saying that everybody.
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  It's Microsoft word some people love it I'm sure you know there's people who just really get into I'm sure there's people who love final draft but for the type of people who don't like word and who would prefer to write a blog post in a simple text editor with mark down.
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  If you're like that you don't like writing your screenplay with final cut or final draft I keep saying final cut final draft and so instead.
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  There's two of these apps that are great and that you know their friends you know it's almost like a friendly competition because they collaborated on the file format this dot fountain file format between them but it's very very mark down like just with some assumptions based on.
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  The rules of.
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  Screenplays so like the way that a screenplay a character name for dialogue is always all caps so if you write.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  In all caps mulch return that it automatically knows that that's a character name and that the next line is dialogue.
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  And you know if you want to put a word in italics you wrap in an asterisks you know just like mark down.
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  But it lets you use if you want to you could just use something like be be at it and just write in a format that is very very readable in its native format and then you process it and outcomes a PDF that looks like a screenplay everything's in courier.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  All the margins are taken care of and stuff like that and but you could use their apps and you know the slug line and fountain and it format does you know as you're typing it looks a little bit more screenplay E.
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  Right off the bat instead of you know pure text but the file format you're saving underneath is just plain text and then you know you have that piece of mind.
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  Like going back to our discussion about like the iworks apps like 20 years from now your screenplay is still just in a you know plain text file you don't have to worry that slug line is still an app.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  You laugh but yeah no I know I know I'm laughing I'm still laughing about the I the I works thing right. And the other thing I think the reason that these apps have taken off is even though final draft is still sort of a standard like.
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  The basic just though is like when you're if you're a working screen play screenwriter the the canonical format that gets passed around as you submit your work and studios read it or you know even if you're already been hired and you have to pass a draft is a PDF file.
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  So it doesn't matter what you used to write it you generate a PDF and that's what everybody reads and these apps create PDFs that look like perfect screen place there's no.
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  There is no system in place like with word with change tracking and stuff like that that you are obligated to use final draft in that way.
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  I mean maybe some studios have something like that but for the most part it seems like a lot of you know working screenwriters can just use these apps and miss out on nothing.
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  It pleases me to no end that that something I did you know with no almost like 0.000001% input for me that these guys went out and made something inspired by it that is you know really solves a problem for screenwriters that mark down solved for me as a somebody writing for a blog.
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  Right.
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  Do you have any you probably might not want to drop any names but I mean you know there's got to be some some famous people who are using these apps.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  Well John August right I mean maybe I don't know if anybody bigger than that but you know John August writes you know blockbuster movies right right.
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  I don't know anybody you know of any other it'd be pretty cool to know though if you know which summer you know blockbuster movies are written right with these.
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  That'd be pretty awesome.
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  Think about what else has been in the news you know what it's old news at this point but Merlin and I didn't even mention it last week was Tim Cook coming out as gay.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  Yeah that was I guess it's about two weeks ago now but I thought that was so amazingly well done it's almost unbelievably how well out how how that played out.
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  Yeah it's not I mean it's in it's I think I said on my website that.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  It's nice for people who might be having trouble you know I mean a guy like Tim Cook is probably not really having trouble as a gate you know as much trouble as some other people are having as a gay gay people he probably did growing up though.
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  Yeah because of the south well I even this leave the south out of it but he's a little bit older than me he's I guess he's probably about your age right isn't he around 50.
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  I don't know how old he is. Yeah something seems like that maybe a little bit maybe slightly older.
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  All right if only there is some way that we could look up.
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  We could probably have Siri.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  I wonder if she knows.
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  How old is Tim Cook?
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:49.000]  Let's see. Okay I found this on the web for how old is he? Oh no immediate answer 54. 54 years old. Yeah.
[1:57:49.000 --> 1:58:03.000]  You know I grew up in suburban Philadelphia you know which is you know a little I think relatively speaking a little bit not certainly not socially super liberal but you know it's a little bit more liberal than that South.
[1:58:03.000 --> 1:58:17.000]  You know when I grew up it being gay was something that it just wasn't talked about really just wasn't I don't know when I was a kid it just I didn't really think it was I sort of vaguely knew what it meant but it didn't seem like it was anybody.
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  You know it seemed like something that like maybe one in 10,000 people were gay I don't know it just seemed very very it's just seemed like something that must have been obscure because nobody talked about it.
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  And I'm sure the adults knew that it was more common but it was something that it was basically not talked about.
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:45.000]  And I think people you know it's like I think in that era people didn't talk about it with their kids because they didn't want to give the kid the the idea.
[1:58:45.000 --> 1:58:55.000]  I wasn't with the thought process they think I don't know it was saying it for the kid because then the kid will become curious about what being gay is and the kid might become gay.
[1:58:55.000 --> 1:59:09.000]  You know and combine it with works you know combine it with the fact that all like Christian religions are generally opposed to it you know like the I grew up in a Catholic family in it you know the Catholic church considers it a sin.
[1:59:09.000 --> 1:59:19.000]  You know they consider all sorts of I mean skipping churches a sin too but you know sins are obviously bad things and you know that was under that rubric.
[1:59:19.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  And you know people nobody was gay on TV and I know TV is you know is is not a reflection of America or of culture as a whole but it it informs it right it's like what what aspects of culture make it on the TV somehow are like this is the.
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:46.000]  Like this is the parts of society this is the parts of our culture that are okay and nobody was gay on TV which meant it was not okay.
[1:59:46.000 --> 1:59:49.000]  You know it was weird it was a bad time.
[1:59:49.000 --> 1:59:54.000]  I think about this with my son who is the it was the center square guy on.
[1:59:54.000 --> 1:59:59.000]  Paul Linde Paul Linde on Hollywood squares in hindsight clearly.
[1:59:59.000 --> 2:00:13.000]  I know he was gay as anybody who's ever been gay and I had no idea I honestly as a kid this I mean and I'm not that old but I honestly thought that he was just flamboyant.
[2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  I did not realize I had no idea just I did know whereas like and I think it's amazing in one generation that like my son is growing up in a world where you know being gay is you know just like having different colored skin.
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  It's just some people are that way you know and you know we in Philadelphia we you know people are gay all the time and you know they are and friends in his school have you know some of his friends have two moms and you know it's it's not even that he honestly doesn't even think about it.
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  Hank's best friend from you know since growing up I mean he met this kid when he was one or two maybe maybe it was two but I'm very early on and he's got two moms and we were fortunate enough to go to their wedding which was about a year ago.
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:15.000]  And it's just it's awesome I cannot I am so happy that the world is changing this way but it's you know it's not like that everywhere and certainly wasn't like that for Tim Cook growing up.
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:27.000]  No yeah and it's and it's still not like that for some people and so they think that's why these you know somebody who's successful like him being able to tell his story is very important.
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  Jonas's middle school he's in fifth grade nine I mean middle school they have a club called glow I think this is so awesome and stands for gay lesbian or whatever.
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  I love that I think that is so awesome because to me that it sounds a little goofy it sounds a little fun but it really sort of expresses the the to me the the the modern way of thinking which is hey whatever floats your boat.
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  You know and everybody you know is different and some people are very different and it's all okay.
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  He's in middle school now.
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  Well fifth grade is called middle school I know.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  I guess yeah but I thought that's such a cool name and it's just to me epitomizes the difference between you know his world and my world right.
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  Thirty years ago when I was in fifth grade because there was no way they were going to have a gay lesbian or whatever club in my school.
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  And I it's Syracuse to talk about this on ATP but with that the we've reached a point in our culture where where nobody everybody seems to agree that you can't be against gay.
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  Right it's it's like culturally agreed upon that it's just you know discriminate it makes you a bad person to be against gays.
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  But you can still be things like against gay marriage like that's still like a culturally acceptable stance to take.
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:59.000]  Yeah decreasingly so though.
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:15.000]  Decreasingly so definitely and it's you know it's catching up to where racism was yeah I mean even people even people who are posed to gay marriage now have a hard time not at least saying that they approve of.
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  Civil unions and right and once you do that you're kind of like okay once the.
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  Right right it's right what you're drawing this difference between religious aspects of marriage and civil aspects of it where but nobody is endorsing a point that religions have to accept it right it's just that legally it has to be called the same thing.
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  And like like the response so nobody I'm sure somewhere on you know obviously on the dark side of Twitter there are where people have anonymous accounts at the you know all sorts of yeah the ugliest thoughts that humans can have are are espoused every second.
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  I saw I saw something that I couldn't figure out if it was I think it must have been tongue in cheek because.
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  I think I was saying you know Tim Cook is gay so you should switch to Android and if you want I will come to your house and pick up your Apple products.
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  And it was written and it wasn't written as a joke it seemed you know I think you know like this is it was sort of like there was a lot there was at least a decent amount of text where this is a
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  lot of information of nature or something but but reading like the bottom line was the guy was offering to drive your house and make a pure Apple products.
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:05:01.000]  I like the culturally acceptable way to sort of you know not just cheer and clap your hands at cooks essay what is this sort of take us and I saw some of this a fair amount of it is sort of who cares this isn't you know you know this is.
[2:05:01.000 --> 2:05:12.000]  Why why why why make this public this is your make your drawing more attention to to to the issue than you know it was totally cool before you actually you know Tim Cook actually wrote this story.
[2:05:12.000 --> 2:05:14.000]  Why why rub this in our faces.
[2:05:14.000 --> 2:05:23.000]  I mean they wouldn't say it that way but that's sort of how it comes across why are you putting this in my face why are you making me think about things that I don't want to think about.
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:34.000]  And it's again I'm just riffing on Syracuse here but it's it's true like as a single person you know one man however powerful he is.
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:45.000]  That it doesn't make that big a difference that he's now publicly out his gay and proud of it then before when he just never spoke about it in public it doesn't make that big a difference but it.
[2:05:45.000 --> 2:06:02.000]  Well I think it doesn't make a difference to me particularly no but it said I mean I think there's like there's a. There are a bunch of people I mean there you know right makes a difference if you're gay I think it but we don't live you know that we're not all isolated from each other everything is related and in context.
[2:06:02.000 --> 2:06:19.000]  You know it and it does matter where we were 10 years ago and 15 years ago right it wasn't that long ago where it was controversial that will embrace had.
[2:06:19.000 --> 2:06:23.000]  Right whereas now that you mean it wasn't that long ago but it.
[2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  It wouldn't be an issue now at all right it's but it's we're coming very fast but we're not there yet right and it really does make a difference that there is a.
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  That one of the most powerful leaders in our country is out and proud of being gay.
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:50.000]  Right I mean how many how many kids are there right now just teenagers today in this country let alone other countries that are far behind us on this issue socially.
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  Who are gay and are worried or even scared about telling their parents and coming out to their friends you know it's.
[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:09.000]  You know heartbreaking and it's still an issue and to have somebody like Tim Cook saying I'm proud of it and consider to give from God is.
[2:07:09.000 --> 2:07:13.000]  It's historic I really do think it's historic yeah.
[2:07:13.000 --> 2:07:21.000]  I can't think because I can't think of any other.
[2:07:21.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  I mean obviously I follow up a lot closely than any other company so I'm sure that maybe there's somebody out there who's.
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:27.000]  Who's upset that I don't didn't pay attention.
[2:07:27.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  There was a guy I don't remember his name there was a guy was like a charge of a bank a CEO of a bank but he didn't come out until after he resigned step down or retired or something like that and said that you know it's that it was really it was.
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:46.000]  You know it's hard was in the other place that's happening now is his professional sports.
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:51.000]  Right so right it's.
[2:07:51.000 --> 2:08:01.000]  Mike it's it's it's a few things that have traditionally two places that have traditionally been fairly conservative that are now being forced to.
[2:08:01.000 --> 2:08:05.000]  Open up about what's really reality.
[2:08:05.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  Yeah I also thought the other thing that was remarkable not just that he did announce it but I thought it was such a well written piece.
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  I reread it's so short very succinct and I firmly believe I'm sure that there you know he didn't write it without any help whatsoever editing or you know and from within.
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  But I do think that it was his words you know in the same way to me it was like like the the Steve jobs thoughts on music and Steve jobs was the other one thoughts on flash.
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  Where you could tell that it was jobs writing it yeah right that there was it wasn't just his name at the bottom of the letter like like what we know of Steve jobs and his obsessions and the way he thinks really came out in those two.
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:09:01.000]  I don't know what you would call him essays yeah and I can't help but think that this this piece is so very Tim Cook.
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:15.000]  In the way that it's written there's a certain meticulousness to it and a tightness of thought and anywhere where you might be tempted to sort of roll your eyes at the sort of idealism of it.
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:32.000]  I think it's genuine I don't think there's any reason to I think it's genuinely how he feels that he truly feels like a social obligation to our society as a whole to make things better in this regard.
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  Do you think that there's there's a reason now as opposed to earlier.
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  I think that you know and who knows maybe he really only came to the decision maybe it was something he was thinking about maybe doing for a year or two years and finally thought and maybe it just popped into his head maybe you know something in September made him think you know I should I should come out because this this.
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  Who knows how long it was planned I don't know but in hindsight it sure feels perfectly timed yes right like in some way you know and it if he had been out for.
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:50.000]  15 years like and had been you know had had like a long time partner you know since before there was even legal game average in California who accompanied him to events and therefore you know it had been out at while he was COO not CEO.
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:11:02.000]  It certainly would have been his right and nobody would write minded would complain about it but it wouldn't have been as big a deal I don't think you know somehow it feels right and the fact that it it's.
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:07.000]  How long is it's in stuftops is that three years right three years yeah yeah eleven eleven.
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  Somehow it feels like the right amount of time where the tumultuousness of him taking over his past it seems like this year and the transition period is over right.
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  Even though Tim Cook spent a lot of time almost effectively being CEO while jobs with sick right there were still you know jobs are still there he still had input into how the products were designed and made.
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:47.000]  You know the point now where no one can reasonably say oh that you know the assure that's a good device but it was you know but jobs had his fingers in that so Tim Cook can't claim it as it is own.
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  Right I've long thought that it even before jobs was sick or what you know maybe he technically was sick because he you know had the cancer.
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:08.000]  You know the whole period from when the cancer was first diagnosed until he died I guess he was technically sick the whole time but even when he was feeling well and they thought they had everything in remission.
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  I still think that the the delegation of duties like what Tim Cook did at Apple versus what Steve Jobs did that Tim Cook was.
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:20.000]  If you just described his duties to someone who didn't know their titles you'd say well he's the CEO.
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  Yeah you know in that jobs is something else maybe the president or something like that you know used to be a more calm you know when we were kids a lot of companies had like a CEO and a president you know yeah I think the CEO is more about.
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  Making company wide decisions and stuff like that you know stuff about the company and the bureaucracy of the company whereas jobs clearly even when he was you know healthy was more.
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  It's solely focused on the products and product development right.
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:59.000]  But even so I still at the time he just seemed so perfect because like you said I think the transition period ended this year like the stocks stabilized.
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:08.000]  They haven't released it but they've at least unveiled a holy the watch which is holy formed post Steve.
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  And it's you know remains we've seen how it's going to you know it isn't out yet but it certainly seems as though there's no you know they're not unable to create a new product that gets people talking.
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:23.000]  That's over the stock is back up.
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  And it just seems like people have finally shut the hell up about the when happen if Steve were still around I mean not entirely but it's like we've passed it.
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:43.000]  I don't know remember a year ago that I can twenty thirty I could look all in my claim chatter files but there were a lot of people literally calling for apples board to fire Tim Cook.
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:47.000]  You know fire Tim Cook he's terrible you know when the stock yeah.
[2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  And you know we're passing it just somehow feels right.
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:54.000]  Yeah.
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:14:01.000]  I'm looking forward to the updated edition of haunted empire.
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  Because any book out of shorter shelf life.
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:16.000]  When I wrote about it I did I wrote I was like I I almost feel like they knew it because it really does it part of what was I thought was bad about the book is it felt rushed it felt like the editing.
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  It felt like it could have been tighter and I can't help but think that they run to rush it out back in February because because they thought it was going to turn around.
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:33.000]  They they just you know I think the writing was on the wall that the thesis of the book was already wrong.
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  Gotta get it out quick.
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  Last thing only thing I can think of I had to send my notes as is this do you see this thing yesterday with the Twitter.
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  Mission statement.
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  Well and I can't give you one minute but I think about it as I compared to the Tim Cook essay on you know coming out as gay and proud and how good the writing is.
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  And I say this is I maybe I value good writing more than most people because I'm a writer and I care about it.
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  But I can't help but I have this basic theory in general whether it's something personal like Tim Cook's thing or whether it's something purely business like like a strategy statement.
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  That good writing is the result of good thinking.
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:30.000]  And bad writing is usually the result of sloppy thinking incomplete thinking you know that it and here's the Twitter's strategy statement.
[2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  The largest daily audience in the world by connecting everyone to their world via our information sharing and distribution platform products and be one of the top revenue generating.
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:48.000]  Internet companies in the world.
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:58.000]  And I can't believe more people I didn't jump on it right away but I couldn't believe that I was the first person I saw to point out that that was not even close to fitting in the length of a tweet.
[2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:02.000]  It's two hundred and twenty characters.
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:03.000]  Right.
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:13.000]  Shouldn't your strategy statement fit in a tweet and especially if you're Twitter it's so bad.
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:16.000]  I need to put it into it longer.
[2:16:16.000 --> 2:16:19.000]  Tweet longer whatever that thing is called.
[2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:21.000]  It's so bad.
[2:16:21.000 --> 2:16:22.000]  It's really bad.
[2:16:22.000 --> 2:16:23.000]  I mean it's yeah.
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:26.000]  I really find it worrisome.
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:35.000]  I find it very worrisome as a platform that I really care about and some level love but that seems to be floundering at an executive level.
[2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:40.000]  You know there's just had some more executive shakeups like where they're.
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:45.000]  They've had like three heads of product in the last like two years.
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:49.000]  And the last one they just demoted was only there six months.
[2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:55.000]  It's I don't know very worrisome and this strategy statement doesn't make me feel any better about it.
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:17:01.000]  It's like I wrote the other day about the net neutrality where.
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:09.000]  Like to me President Obama's statement on it was very clearly written and there might be room to disagree.
[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:16.000]  There might be a reasonable argument against it but I thought that his arguments in favor of it were very clearly expressed.
[2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:17.000]  One two three four.
[2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:20.000]  Here's the reasons that we should make sure we keep it.
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:28.000]  Keep it keep this sort of not favoring one company's packets over another company's packets on the internet.
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:32.000]  Keep it the way it is which has been that all packets are treated equally.
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:39.000]  And the arguments on the other side from the cable companies and the phone providers are so obtuse.
[2:17:39.000 --> 2:17:44.000]  And it's like you can read them and they're their words and I know what the words mean.
[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:52.000]  But damned if I know what the damned if I know what the what the meaning is.
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:18:02.000]  Other than like remember the old silent live skit with Frankenstein and caveman and Frankenstein and forget the other one.
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:03.000]  Yeah.
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:05.000]  Will they send Christmas carols?
[2:18:05.000 --> 2:18:06.000]  Yeah.
[2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:12.000]  It was like Kevin Neal was a caveman.
[2:18:12.000 --> 2:18:14.000]  Who was Frankenstein?
[2:18:14.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  I can't remember.
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:19.000]  And he all Frankenstein ever said was like fire bad.
[2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:27.000]  I can't help but think that the argument against this net neutrality is more or less a knee jerk.
[2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:31.000]  Frankenstein in regulation bad regulation bad.
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:33.000]  It's basically right.
[2:18:33.000 --> 2:18:36.000]  And I'm not one in favor of red tape and bureaucracy.
[2:18:36.000 --> 2:18:45.000]  It's not, you know, I really think you have to see government regulation as a continuum, you know, a race scale from light gray to dark gray.
[2:18:45.000 --> 2:18:49.000]  Not zero, not binary, you know, on or off.
[2:18:49.000 --> 2:18:52.000]  And these companies were regulated already.
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:55.000]  You know, it's not like Comcast doesn't face some regulations.
[2:18:55.000 --> 2:18:57.000]  It's who are the regulations kind of favor.
[2:18:57.000 --> 2:19:04.000]  Consumers and small company startups or multi billion dollar conglomerate.
[2:19:04.000 --> 2:19:11.000]  Like let's stack the deck in favor of Verizon who is making $8 billion a quarter because they need it.
[2:19:11.000 --> 2:19:13.000]  They need to help.
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:14.000]  Yeah.
[2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:15.000]  And I can't.
[2:19:15.000 --> 2:19:19.000]  It's the whole cynicism behind that.
[2:19:19.000 --> 2:19:23.000]  I can't even understand because.
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:28.000]  So there was that that comment that tweet by Ted Cruz.
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:29.000]  Yes.
[2:19:29.000 --> 2:19:32.000]  Senator right from from Texas.
[2:19:32.000 --> 2:19:34.000]  Great data Texas.
[2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:35.000]  Yeah.
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:41.000]  And he said it's the Obama care for the Internet.
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:42.000]  Right.
[2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:43.000]  Right.
[2:19:43.000 --> 2:19:46.000]  And let's not have the Internet operate at the speed of government.
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:47.000]  Right.
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:51.000]  And I tweeted something back to you know some I basically I insulted him.
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:54.000]  I insulted his intelligence is what I did.
[2:19:54.000 --> 2:20:06.000]  And and you know and Josh centers who's editor tidbits correctly pointed out that he's the guy graduated like magnet cum laude from Harvard or something.
[2:20:06.000 --> 2:20:07.000]  Yeah.
[2:20:07.000 --> 2:20:08.000]  I can't remember what you think that's right.
[2:20:08.000 --> 2:20:11.000]  But and you know he's not he's actually not an idiot.
[2:20:11.000 --> 2:20:13.000]  He's just an asshole.
[2:20:13.000 --> 2:20:14.000]  Yeah.
[2:20:14.000 --> 2:20:17.000]  It's just a cynical.
[2:20:17.000 --> 2:20:18.000]  Yeah.
[2:20:18.000 --> 2:20:22.000]  He's protecting his buddies at the big cable industries.
[2:20:22.000 --> 2:20:24.000]  Yeah.
[2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:25.000]  He's like a cum laude laude.
[2:20:25.000 --> 2:20:26.000]  How do you pronounce it?
[2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:27.000]  I don't know.
[2:20:27.000 --> 2:20:29.000]  I guess if I ever went to Harvard I didn't learn.
[2:20:29.000 --> 2:20:31.000]  That's right guys like us we don't know how to pronounce that.
[2:20:31.000 --> 2:20:32.000]  Right.
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:35.000]  Well with my grades it never really came.
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:37.000]  Never came up.
[2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:38.000]  Yeah.
[2:20:38.000 --> 2:20:39.000]  It's definitely not a dummy.
[2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:45.000]  But he's definitely a cynical because he knows how to communicate at this sort of caveman level of.
[2:20:45.000 --> 2:20:46.000]  Right.
[2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:49.000]  Internet you know government regulation bad.
[2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:52.000]  And that goes no further than that.
[2:20:52.000 --> 2:20:59.000]  And you know it's the same people who think that the government should cut back on handouts
[2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:03.000]  and not decrease the size of their Medicare check.
[2:21:03.000 --> 2:21:04.000]  Sure.
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:05.000]  Social security.
[2:21:05.000 --> 2:21:06.000]  Right.
[2:21:06.000 --> 2:21:07.000]  It's the other handouts.
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:08.000]  Right.
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:09.000]  Keep government out of my social security.
[2:21:09.000 --> 2:21:10.000]  Yeah.
[2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:11.000]  That's it.
[2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  Keep government out of my social security.
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:18.000]  Like that you ask people if you think the government to stay out of social security and you get like a 60% response rate that says yes.
[2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:20.000]  Keep them out of social security.
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:22.000]  And it really doesn't make a lot of sense.
[2:21:22.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  But anyway I'm deeply worried about Twitter and their, their strategy.
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:27.000]  Yeah.
[2:21:27.000 --> 2:21:28.000]  Yeah.
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:29.000]  Yeah.
[2:21:29.000 --> 2:21:32.000]  I'm like thinking about the future of that does not make me very happy.
[2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  Yeah.
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:46.000]  I can't help but think that the translation from whatever language is written in the English that the reach the largest daily audience in the world by connecting everyone to the, in the world to be above about something something where they want to be more like Facebook.
[2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:48.000]  It is to me what that means.
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:50.000]  Because Facebook is more popular.
[2:21:50.000 --> 2:21:53.000]  And at the target of this message was not normal people.
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:58.000]  It was to bankers and investment people and people who've kept Twitter's stock.
[2:21:58.000 --> 2:22:03.000]  It's, I think at last I checked it's slightly below where they IPOed last year.
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:04.000]  So it hasn't cratered.
[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:05.000]  It hasn't tanked.
[2:22:05.000 --> 2:22:10.000]  But nobody has an IPO and hopes that the stock is flat in the first year, you know.
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:15.000]  And so there is some definite skepticism and that this is addressed at the people who have more or less kept their stock.
[2:22:15.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  And in the meantime, Facebook is going up and up and up.
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:23.000]  And to me, the translation of this is we're going to somehow try to be more like Facebook.
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:27.000]  Whereas to me, the whole point of Twitter is that it's sort of an anti Facebook.
[2:22:27.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  Yeah.
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:34.000]  And whether that means that inherently they're always going to be smaller than Facebook financially and user base wise, so be it.
[2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  But at least be true to yourself.
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:42.000]  You know, and the whole reason that you've had any success at all is that you're not them.
[2:22:42.000 --> 2:22:43.000]  Right.
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:44.000]  Right.
[2:22:44.000 --> 2:22:45.000]  Nothing wrong.
[2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:49.000]  Sometimes a great idea isn't going to be the most successful version of that idea.
[2:22:49.000 --> 2:22:50.000]  Right.
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:54.000]  The Twitter, I think, is genius and is so well designed and so clever in so many ways.
[2:22:54.000 --> 2:23:01.000]  But maybe the ways that it's genius and simple inherently mean that it can never be as big as Facebook.
[2:23:01.000 --> 2:23:02.000]  Right.
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:03.000]  And so be it.
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:04.000]  It can still be profitable.
[2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:10.000]  You know, that to me is the scary part of their strategy statement.
[2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:17.000]  Is that to me, it somehow translates into we're going to wreck what makes Twitter Twitter.
[2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:22.000]  Well, it addresses nothing about what users like about Twitter.
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:23.000]  No.
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:24.000]  Yeah.
[2:23:24.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  And that seems to be that that to me seems like the thing that you should be doing.
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:35.000]  The thing that you should be doing primarily in your mission statement and really only in your mission statement.
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:39.000]  I mean, that's what makes a mission statement.
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:46.000]  It makes it reach people and I worked at a financial services company and back when it was
[2:23:46.000 --> 2:23:47.000]  good.
[2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:50.000]  Are the mission statement.
[2:23:50.000 --> 2:23:54.000]  Back when the company was good or when the financial industry was good.
[2:23:54.000 --> 2:23:57.000]  I think it was a whole industry because you're talking about the whole industry.
[2:23:57.000 --> 2:23:59.000]  I thought you're going to have to go back 300 years.
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:01.000]  No, no, no, just the company that I worked at.
[2:24:01.000 --> 2:24:04.000]  And their mission statement was improving financial security for people.
[2:24:04.000 --> 2:24:05.000]  Was it?
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  That's not bad.
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:07.000]  Yeah.
[2:24:07.000 --> 2:24:11.000]  I mean, just like that's what people were, you know, they like would taps into the thing
[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:12.000]  that people are worried about.
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:13.000]  They're worried about their financial security.
[2:24:13.000 --> 2:24:15.000]  They want to make sure that they can retire.
[2:24:15.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  And that's what we did.
[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:19.000]  That was, you know, let's what we tried to do anyway.
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:20.000]  Right.
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  It's like backblays for your finances.
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:23.000]  Right.
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:24.000]  Let's just sleep on it.
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:25.000]  Exactly.
[2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  Right.
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:27.000]  I'm not choking right now.
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:28.000]  You're right.
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  That's a good goal.
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  Right.
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:33.000]  If you feel like your personal, your family's personal finances are in good hands and in sound
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:36.000]  shape for the future and for retirement, you feel better.
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:39.000]  You know, just drifting off to sleep at night.
[2:24:39.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  Yeah.
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:45.000]  You know, as opposed to being wide-eyed, white and knuckled, you know.
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:47.000]  What am I going to do?
[2:24:47.000 --> 2:24:48.000]  Anyway, we should wrap it up.
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:51.000]  So now I'm going to be wide-eyed and wake about Twitter.
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:52.000]  Yeah, white knuckled.
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:54.000]  And we've already blown it with app.net.
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:55.000]  We've already left.
[2:24:55.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  Yeah.
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:24:59.000]  We let that slide some day.
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:00.000]  What are we going to do now?
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:04.000]  Someday, we're going to come back at hand and they're going to be like,

[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  Everything you type into the box and app.net.
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:17.000]  Just our JavaScript just turns it into told you so.

[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:27.000]  All right.
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  I want to thank our sponsors.
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:29.000]  Igloo.
[2:25:29.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  Harries.

[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:39.000]  Thank you.
[2:25:39.000 --> 2:25:41.000]  You know, this is episode 100 of this.
[2:25:41.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  Oh, really?
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:43.000]  Is that right?
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  I had no idea.
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  I was episode one, you know.
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  I do.
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  I remember it very clearly.
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  So I, you know, it's a pleasure to have you back on episode 100.
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  Where can people go to find out more about your book?
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:26:00.000]  I will be posting shortly on very nice website.net about it.
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:05.000]  But if you go to peachpit.com and search on visual guide to minecraft or my name,
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:09.000]  Moltz, M-O-L-T-Z, it'll come up and.
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:12.000]  Highly remind craft playing enjoyment.
[2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:14.000]  Highly recommended for anybody out there.
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:16.000]  And I just know it because every time I bring it up on the show,
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:20.000]  I get email from people in the same boat as me and where you were a year ago,
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:23.000]  where your kid is obsessed with it and you're, yeah.
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  You see in a cult, what's going on?
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:30.000]  Should I be worried?
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:32.000]  And I think the short answer is no.
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:34.000]  It's actually, I mean, no, it's great.
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:35.000]  It's great.
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:37.000]  It's a creative outlet.
[2:26:37.000 --> 2:26:40.000]  And it is the opposite of like mindlessness.
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:42.000]  It is super engaging.
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:46.000]  But if you're, as lost as I am, God buy this book.
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:49.000]  And otherwise, very nice website.net.
[2:26:49.000 --> 2:26:50.000]  Yes.
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  That's great.
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:52.000]  Thank you, John.
[2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:53.000]  Thank you.
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:56.000]  Okay.
