[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  So, Joanna, you have a new puppy, and it's a boy?
[00:05.000 --> 00:06.000]  It's a boy.
[00:06.000 --> 00:07.000]  What's his name?
[00:07.000 --> 00:08.000]  I had a boy.
[00:08.000 --> 00:09.000]  It's a boy.
[00:09.000 --> 00:10.000]  What's his name?
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  His name is Browser.
[00:11.000 --> 00:12.000]  Hmm.
[00:12.000 --> 00:13.000]  Yeah.
[00:13.000 --> 00:14.000]  Yeah.
[00:14.000 --> 00:15.000]  That's it.
[00:15.000 --> 00:18.080]  Not as in Safari, Firefox, or Chrome.
[00:18.080 --> 00:20.200]  Just Browser.
[00:20.200 --> 00:21.200]  We show no platform.
[00:21.200 --> 00:24.500]  We're platform agnostic in the puppy family here.
[00:24.500 --> 00:28.000]  Somehow, Browser makes for a good dog name, but any one of the individual ones would be
[00:28.000 --> 00:29.000]  a terrible name.
[00:29.000 --> 00:30.000]  I know.
[00:30.000 --> 00:34.280]  We had so many things on the list, and my wife said no to pretty much every other tech
[00:34.280 --> 00:35.560]  name I had on the list.
[00:35.560 --> 00:37.840]  I mean, I think Cordy is a mistake.
[00:37.840 --> 00:39.560]  I think we should have named him Cordy.
[00:39.560 --> 00:40.560]  Hmm.
[00:40.560 --> 00:44.000]  I'm trying to think which browser would make for the worst name.
[00:44.000 --> 00:45.000]  IE.
[00:45.000 --> 00:47.000]  Come here, IE.
[00:47.000 --> 00:48.760]  Come here, IE.
[00:48.760 --> 00:50.200]  Chrome sounds a little cold.
[00:50.200 --> 00:52.000]  Oh, you crashed again.
[00:52.000 --> 00:53.000]  You crashed.
[00:53.000 --> 00:54.000]  Yeah.
[00:54.000 --> 00:55.000]  Yeah, so?
[00:55.000 --> 00:56.000]  He's adorable.
[00:56.000 --> 00:57.000]  He's really adorable.
[00:57.000 --> 01:00.680]  I've turned into that person that I hate, which I'm constantly posting photos of my
[01:00.680 --> 01:05.160]  puppy doing the same thing that he did five minutes ago.
[01:05.160 --> 01:09.200]  Like right now, he's sleeping under my desk, and it's taking everything in me not to post
[01:09.200 --> 01:11.120]  another photo of him.
[01:11.120 --> 01:13.420]  Firefox sounds like a cool dog name.
[01:13.420 --> 01:14.420]  It does.
[01:14.420 --> 01:16.840]  It would have been a little bit of an identity crisis for him, I feel like.
[01:16.840 --> 01:20.240]  I'm going to say Internet Explorer is the worst name for a dog, and I'm going to say
[01:20.240 --> 01:26.560]  Firefox was the best, if you were to name your dog after any individual browser.
[01:26.560 --> 01:27.560]  Yeah.
[01:27.560 --> 01:28.560]  Yeah.
[01:28.560 --> 01:31.680]  I mean Netscape would have been a little bit cute.
[01:31.680 --> 01:32.680]  Hmm.
[01:32.680 --> 01:33.680]  Maybe.
[01:33.680 --> 01:35.680]  Was that your watch pinging?
[01:35.680 --> 01:37.640]  Yes.
[01:37.640 --> 01:42.040]  One of the little details of wearing a watch is that now there's yet another thing to make
[01:42.040 --> 01:44.040]  sure it's silent.
[01:44.040 --> 01:45.040]  I know.
[01:45.040 --> 01:46.040]  I'm going to silence it.
[01:46.040 --> 01:47.040]  Maybe I'm not.
[01:47.040 --> 01:48.040]  You know what?
[01:48.040 --> 01:49.040]  I'm not going to.
[01:49.040 --> 01:50.040]  Let's just see how many times it goes off.
[01:50.040 --> 01:51.040]  That's right.
[01:51.040 --> 01:52.040]  All right.
[01:52.040 --> 01:53.760]  I actually find, and I guess we're just diving right into it.
[01:53.760 --> 01:58.800]  I found, and I even wrote about this, that the watch works way more naturally to me with
[01:58.800 --> 01:59.800]  sound off.
[01:59.800 --> 02:03.280]  I have sound off, I would say, in the... I guess it's been two weeks.
[02:03.280 --> 02:04.280]  Yeah.
[02:04.280 --> 02:07.320]  I guess as we're recording, we've had it for two plus weeks.
[02:07.320 --> 02:13.520]  Two weeks of daily use, I think I've had sound off 90% of the time.
[02:13.520 --> 02:17.280]  Actually it's funny because I usually, when I put it in do not disturb mode or silent
[02:17.280 --> 02:20.520]  mode, I forget about it.
[02:20.520 --> 02:23.720]  Then when I'm like, you know, I haven't heard the sound in a while, I turn it back
[02:23.720 --> 02:24.720]  on.
[02:24.720 --> 02:29.800]  But when you say sound off, you just have the tap deck.
[02:29.800 --> 02:30.800]  Yes.
[02:30.800 --> 02:32.360]  So I'm still getting the alerts.
[02:32.360 --> 02:36.560]  It's just the noises for them that I don't have on.
[02:36.560 --> 02:37.560]  Yeah.
[02:37.560 --> 02:38.560]  You know what?
[02:38.560 --> 02:41.200]  I haven't had that on that much either, to be honest, because if I'm in meetings or
[02:41.200 --> 02:43.160]  stuff, I turn that off.
[02:43.160 --> 02:44.760]  And it's not just about interrupting people.
[02:44.760 --> 02:46.840]  To me, it's... I don't know.
[02:46.840 --> 02:48.640]  Somehow in my mind, it just feels right.
[02:48.640 --> 02:52.160]  It feels right that the watch is tapping me to say, hey, I've got something.
[02:52.160 --> 02:53.160]  Right.
[02:53.160 --> 02:55.640]  To me, it's like I had that with my phone.
[02:55.640 --> 02:56.640]  I don't know.
[02:56.640 --> 03:01.120]  It doesn't... It just doesn't seem right to me that my watch is making noise.
[03:01.120 --> 03:09.440]  The only sound I have on my phone is for my email or iMessage, pretty much everything.
[03:09.440 --> 03:13.880]  But on the other hand, I do think, and I'm on the fence about this, I can't quite tell.
[03:13.880 --> 03:17.060]  I kind of think, and this is one of those things that even two weeks in, I can't quite
[03:17.060 --> 03:18.060]  make up my mind.
[03:18.060 --> 03:23.600]  I kind of feel like I want the Taptic Engine to be a little bit stronger.
[03:23.600 --> 03:24.600]  Really?
[03:24.600 --> 03:25.640]  Just a little.
[03:25.640 --> 03:29.600]  And it just seems like every once in a while, I miss one.
[03:29.600 --> 03:30.600]  You miss one.
[03:30.600 --> 03:31.600]  I've had that too.
[03:31.600 --> 03:32.800]  I've definitely had that where I miss one.
[03:32.800 --> 03:37.640]  But sometimes I feel like maybe it's because my Milanese loop is a little bit loose.
[03:37.640 --> 03:38.640]  My loop is loose.
[03:38.640 --> 03:39.640]  Sounds bad.
[03:39.640 --> 03:40.640]  It sounds really bad.
[03:40.640 --> 03:45.320]  With the Milanese though, you can... It's just a question of how comfortable it is though.
[03:45.320 --> 03:48.160]  If you wanted it tighter, you could just tighten it a little bit.
[03:48.160 --> 03:49.160]  Oh yeah.
[03:49.160 --> 03:50.160]  Yeah.
[03:50.160 --> 03:51.160]  I find it so comfortable.
[03:51.160 --> 03:54.680]  I mean, I cannot overestimate how comfortable this thing is.
[03:54.680 --> 03:55.680]  Yeah.
[03:55.680 --> 03:56.680]  It seems comfortable.
[03:56.680 --> 03:57.920]  I did not get to spend time with it.
[03:57.920 --> 03:59.920]  I wasn't sure what they were going to do and I feel like...
[03:59.920 --> 04:00.920]  Which one are you wearing again?
[04:00.920 --> 04:02.320]  I'm wearing the Link bracelet.
[04:02.320 --> 04:04.440]  Again, about 90% of the time.
[04:04.440 --> 04:07.160]  But I have... I think everybody got the white sport band.
[04:07.160 --> 04:08.600]  Oh no, no.
[04:08.600 --> 04:09.600]  I have the blue.
[04:09.600 --> 04:10.600]  Oh, you did get blue.
[04:10.600 --> 04:11.600]  I forgot.
[04:11.600 --> 04:12.600]  I remember from your video.
[04:12.600 --> 04:13.600]  Did you ask for that?
[04:13.600 --> 04:14.600]  Yeah.
[04:14.600 --> 04:16.640]  A little inside baseball.
[04:16.640 --> 04:18.560]  I didn't ask for that one.
[04:18.560 --> 04:19.560]  But I think...
[04:19.560 --> 04:20.560]  They didn't.
[04:20.560 --> 04:21.960]  They didn't even ask me.
[04:21.960 --> 04:24.200]  I wasn't even offered a choice of a sport band.
[04:24.200 --> 04:25.640]  They just gave me white.
[04:25.640 --> 04:26.640]  Yeah.
[04:26.640 --> 04:30.600]  I asked for black and then they didn't have the black when they came to New York and so
[04:30.600 --> 04:32.800]  they're going to get me to swap out the black.
[04:32.800 --> 04:36.240]  But actually, that's the one I'm going to order, so yeah.
[04:36.240 --> 04:37.240]  And I've heard from people.
[04:37.240 --> 04:43.760]  I have not done the... Because you and I are spoiled and we've already got review units,
[04:43.760 --> 04:47.680]  I have not done the thing where I've gone to a store and tried on the watches.
[04:47.680 --> 04:48.680]  Me either.
[04:48.680 --> 04:54.320]  But I have heard from people who have, who a bunch of them seem to say that the various
[04:54.320 --> 04:58.160]  sport bands feel subtly different from each other.
[04:58.160 --> 05:02.440]  That black is even more supple than white.
[05:02.440 --> 05:05.040]  Not that they're radically different, but that they're different enough that they feel
[05:05.040 --> 05:08.280]  confident that like with their eyes closed, they could tell which was which.
[05:08.280 --> 05:09.280]  Right.
[05:09.280 --> 05:13.720]  Well, I have this problem with the sport band and I... It's a small problem, so I didn't
[05:13.720 --> 05:17.080]  really talk about it much or... You kind of see it in that video when I'm having a
[05:17.080 --> 05:22.600]  hard time putting it on where they have the small medium band in the same one and then
[05:22.600 --> 05:24.640]  they have the medium large band.
[05:24.640 --> 05:25.640]  Yes.
[05:25.640 --> 05:28.360]  And the medium large band is a little bit too big.
[05:28.360 --> 05:32.920]  Like the last one, the last... What's a hole?
[05:32.920 --> 05:35.400]  There's probably a professional word for that hole.
[05:35.400 --> 05:39.320]  Anyway, on that one, it gets a little bit too big.
[05:39.320 --> 05:43.600]  So I have to use the smaller band which makes it much harder to put on, but it fits much
[05:43.600 --> 05:49.320]  nicer when I have it on and for what I found, I always change into that for working out
[05:49.320 --> 05:55.240]  and that fit is so important when you're working out because I found... I did a couple workout
[05:55.240 --> 06:00.240]  classes with the Milanese, went on a run and I really did not find as accurate heart rate
[06:00.240 --> 06:04.200]  tracking and then when I switch it for that sport band, it's far more accurate.
[06:04.200 --> 06:09.080]  The problem is it takes me forever to put it on because it's a little bit too small,
[06:09.080 --> 06:11.400]  but when I finally get it on my wrist, it fits perfectly.
[06:11.400 --> 06:13.120]  I see what you mean.
[06:13.120 --> 06:15.400]  I read that in a review and that was one of the things I want to talk about.
[06:15.400 --> 06:17.800]  Now I understand why you found it a little harder to get on.
[06:17.800 --> 06:22.160]  So in other words, when you put the smaller... Just to step back up, I know there's been
[06:22.160 --> 06:27.240]  a lot of confusion on this because just from people who read the site and emailing me and
[06:27.240 --> 06:33.960]  tweeting me, when it says that you get two straps with your Apple Watch Sport, what they
[06:33.960 --> 06:42.600]  mean is you get two sizes and that's true whether you get 38 or 42.
[06:42.600 --> 06:44.240]  So you actually get three pieces.
[06:44.240 --> 06:49.800]  The top piece is the same, the one that actually has the slot that the other piece tucks under
[06:49.800 --> 06:51.720]  and it has the pin.
[06:51.720 --> 06:57.420]  Then you get two bottom pieces, the piece with the holes that you pop the pin into.
[06:57.420 --> 06:59.040]  One is smaller, one is larger.
[06:59.040 --> 07:00.040]  I see what you're saying.
[07:00.040 --> 07:04.680]  You're saying that the smaller of them, once it's on, is a better feel, but because there's
[07:04.680 --> 07:09.160]  only a little bit left of it to tuck under, you've got it.
[07:09.160 --> 07:10.160]  Right.
[07:10.160 --> 07:13.080]  So I really wonder, is that really meant for kids?
[07:13.080 --> 07:18.920]  Who has that small of a wrist for the really... When you get it on the closest and strap
[07:18.920 --> 07:20.040]  the small... I don't have it.
[07:20.040 --> 07:23.120]  It's on the other side of the room and I'm afraid I'll wake up the puppy if I go get
[07:23.120 --> 07:25.800]  it.
[07:25.800 --> 07:26.800]  It's really small.
[07:26.800 --> 07:27.800]  Yeah.
[07:27.800 --> 07:28.800]  I totally-
[07:28.800 --> 07:29.800]  Right?
[07:29.800 --> 07:34.480]  I mean, I assume... I wonder if the bands are the same size... They must be, right?
[07:34.480 --> 07:37.480]  The bands must be the same size whether you get the 38 or the 42.
[07:37.480 --> 07:46.360]  No, I think that the 42s are probably bigger because the 42... I think that the big one
[07:46.360 --> 07:50.120]  on the 42 is just humongous.
[07:50.120 --> 07:58.120]  It's almost... I would guess that there are very few men on the planet for whom the larger
[07:58.120 --> 08:01.160]  of the 42 is still not big enough.
[08:01.160 --> 08:04.160]  It is truly, truly... It's like putting a belt on my wrist.
[08:04.160 --> 08:09.480]  So the small one... Actually, for me, with the 42... I'm six foot two.
[08:09.480 --> 08:10.800]  My wrists aren't particularly large.
[08:10.800 --> 08:14.480]  I think they're... For someone as tall as I am, they're probably a little bit on the
[08:14.480 --> 08:21.480]  small side, but the smaller one... I use the smaller one with the 42 and I'm only three
[08:21.480 --> 08:24.360]  holes into it.
[08:24.360 --> 08:26.080]  The smaller one with the... Oh.
[08:26.080 --> 08:30.560]  I actually have five... I think there's seven holes.
[08:30.560 --> 08:33.360]  I'm not even halfway on the smaller one.
[08:33.360 --> 08:36.720]  It's actually... The 42s are very large.
[08:36.720 --> 08:39.200]  And I definitely... I definitely... That would make sense.
[08:39.200 --> 08:43.520]  And I definitely think that the 38 small one is definitely meant to range down to kid sizes
[08:43.520 --> 08:49.440]  because we've done the thing where Apple has the, here's what you're... Measure your wrist
[08:49.440 --> 08:52.160]  in millimeters and here's the ranges.
[08:52.160 --> 08:58.360]  And for Jonas, who's only 11 and is pretty slight for an 11-year-old boy, he easily is
[08:58.360 --> 08:59.360]  within the range.
[08:59.360 --> 09:04.120]  It's not even... He might even have a hole or two to spare.
[09:04.120 --> 09:05.280]  Is he getting one?
[09:05.280 --> 09:06.280]  He wants one.
[09:06.280 --> 09:12.560]  I think there's some question over report card grades and motivating him to get one.
[09:12.560 --> 09:14.680]  But he desperately wants one.
[09:14.680 --> 09:17.320]  Oh, man.
[09:17.320 --> 09:21.680]  I'm trying to think of what I used to work for when I was younger.
[09:21.680 --> 09:24.080]  Think money or sports.
[09:24.080 --> 09:26.320]  I worked for sports stuff.
[09:26.320 --> 09:27.880]  It might not shock people.
[09:27.880 --> 09:32.160]  I was a huge tomboy, so it'd be like if I could get a new... One time I really wanted
[09:32.160 --> 09:34.000]  a new basketball hoop or something like that.
[09:34.000 --> 09:35.000]  Right.
[09:35.000 --> 09:40.880]  Or like an upgrade from a crappy rubber basketball to a nice synthetic leather one.
[09:40.880 --> 09:41.880]  Right.
[09:41.880 --> 09:42.880]  Right.
[09:42.880 --> 09:45.720]  That was always my problem growing up playing basketball was if I ever needed a new one,
[09:45.720 --> 09:49.120]  I wanted the $45 synthetic leather Spaulding.
[09:49.120 --> 09:51.720]  And my parents would be like, are you nuts?
[09:51.720 --> 09:52.720]  Here's a $17 basketball.
[09:52.720 --> 09:55.720]  I'd be like, but it's made out of rubber.
[09:55.720 --> 09:56.720]  Yeah.
[09:56.720 --> 09:59.200]  And now the kids work for Apple watches.
[09:59.200 --> 10:00.200]  That's cute.
[10:00.200 --> 10:01.200]  Right.
[10:01.200 --> 10:02.200]  He desperately wants one.
[10:02.200 --> 10:03.200]  But I do wonder.
[10:03.200 --> 10:07.240]  I wonder who that's really useful for, for kids.
[10:07.240 --> 10:10.040]  I wonder what the use case is going to be for them.
[10:10.040 --> 10:15.800]  Well, we can get into that, but I'm... Again, it's speculative and it's certainly... And
[10:15.800 --> 10:22.920]  there's clearly socioeconomic implications of the idea of a school where a bunch of the
[10:22.920 --> 10:26.560]  kids have $400 Apple watches.
[10:26.560 --> 10:30.760]  But in that world, I think that the communication stuff is going to be huge.
[10:30.760 --> 10:31.760]  Mm-hmm.
[10:31.760 --> 10:32.760]  Right.
[10:32.760 --> 10:36.680]  Because they have a... I think it's... How would you say he was?
[10:36.680 --> 10:37.680]  He's 11.
[10:37.680 --> 10:38.680]  11.
[10:38.680 --> 10:39.680]  Yeah.
[10:39.680 --> 10:44.960]  I mean, you're not in... They have all these kiddie smart watches, I guess that's what
[10:44.960 --> 10:45.960]  they're called.
[10:45.960 --> 10:49.240]  But they are sort of the trackers that have the built-in GPS and stuff like that.
[10:49.240 --> 10:56.400]  I mean, it seems like that's probably not the right age range for something like this.
[10:56.400 --> 11:00.960]  And in terms of communication, obviously it would be great for parents, right?
[11:00.960 --> 11:05.760]  Keeping tabs on their kids, making sure they see the alerts or something like that.
[11:05.760 --> 11:10.920]  But I don't know if it spans into that tracking type of thing.
[11:10.920 --> 11:11.920]  Yeah.
[11:11.920 --> 11:14.280]  It's no more so than having a phone.
[11:14.280 --> 11:16.960]  Having a phone, right.
[11:16.960 --> 11:18.640]  But that's... And he's in fifth grade.
[11:18.640 --> 11:23.560]  I can't even imagine what it's like with the girls, who are clearly more advanced socially
[11:23.560 --> 11:24.960]  than the boys.
[11:24.960 --> 11:25.960]  Right.
[11:25.960 --> 11:31.040]  But even with his friends, the texting has really taken off this year.
[11:31.040 --> 11:36.920]  Fifth grade seems to be where the boys in his class have really taken off with the texting.
[11:36.920 --> 11:38.200]  And I don't even pay attention to it.
[11:38.200 --> 11:43.500]  My wife does, just to make sure it's nothing inappropriate or whatever.
[11:43.500 --> 11:45.200]  But it just seems inscrutable.
[11:45.200 --> 11:46.600]  It's like gibberish.
[11:46.600 --> 11:49.160]  It's like a foreign language.
[11:49.160 --> 11:52.320]  Well, that brings me to the best part of your review.
[11:52.320 --> 11:56.200]  Your review is great, but I have to say, the best part of your review is your teen romance
[11:56.200 --> 11:57.480]  at the end.
[11:57.480 --> 12:02.500]  Which is also the part that got the most like, are you freaking serious?
[12:02.500 --> 12:05.480]  This is a bunch of crap.
[12:05.480 --> 12:08.620]  You can either foresee, you're either the type of person who can see that scenario or
[12:08.620 --> 12:09.620]  you're not.
[12:09.620 --> 12:14.760]  And the people who cannot see it think that I'm, I don't know, drank too much rosé wine
[12:14.760 --> 12:17.300]  or whatever when I wrote that part.
[12:17.300 --> 12:18.640]  But I meant it seriously.
[12:18.640 --> 12:20.560]  I really did.
[12:20.560 --> 12:26.040]  I mean, I think if, if anything, I mean, do you think years ago we could have foreseen
[12:26.040 --> 12:28.480]  us communicating at all with emoji?
[12:28.480 --> 12:29.480]  No.
[12:29.480 --> 12:30.480]  I mean, right?
[12:30.480 --> 12:35.120]  Like that, I mean, as crazy as, as some of those graphs sounded and as crazy as some
[12:35.120 --> 12:39.160]  of these like emoticons that they put on here and as much as I sort of made fun of them
[12:39.160 --> 12:41.840]  a little bit, you just really don't know.
[12:41.840 --> 12:46.360]  And like, I think it would have sounded crazy to us a number of years ago that like, we
[12:46.360 --> 12:52.000]  would all be texting in emojis and sometimes complete sentences in them and people understand
[12:52.000 --> 12:53.000]  that.
[12:53.000 --> 12:58.840]  Like that idea is, is kind of crazy and I certainly think that visual way of communicating
[12:58.840 --> 13:07.080]  with each other, whether it's photos or creepy mime hands or creepy heart rates could
[13:07.080 --> 13:11.160]  certainly be way bigger than we actually think it might be.
[13:11.160 --> 13:15.880]  But I think you were totally right to say that it might appeal to a younger demographic
[13:15.880 --> 13:22.400]  or it just might turn into something that like becomes this language amongst a different
[13:22.400 --> 13:23.760]  sort of generation.
[13:23.760 --> 13:26.000]  Maybe, maybe just shows how old we are.
[13:26.000 --> 13:27.000]  Yeah.
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.800]  No, that's exactly the sort of thing I was trying to get at and I believe it.
[13:29.800 --> 13:30.840]  So this is a true story.
[13:30.840 --> 13:37.360]  So my wife and I grew up together, we were literally in the same kindergarten class.
[13:37.360 --> 13:42.560]  And in high school at one point where we would one way we would more or less flirt with each
[13:42.560 --> 13:48.380]  other is we just had a system, we were, we had the same math classes and we had a system
[13:48.380 --> 13:54.240]  where I would, I had like a, I think it was a Casio, but it was the type of type of calculator
[13:54.240 --> 14:00.860]  that someone in AP calculus in 1989 or 90 would have had a whole bunch of buttons and
[14:00.860 --> 14:04.980]  had memory and had a way to like actually put like characters in there.
[14:04.980 --> 14:10.320]  So we had like this complicated system of letters and numbers to make letter, you know,
[14:10.320 --> 14:13.800]  to make notes and it was incredibly cryptic.
[14:13.800 --> 14:17.800]  But then we would just swap calculators and we'd have notes for each other.
[14:17.800 --> 14:22.120]  And it was super, you know, wasn't you, you couldn't actually type, it didn't have a disease,
[14:22.120 --> 14:26.260]  so you had to skip certain things.
[14:26.260 --> 14:29.840]  But it felt like it was foolproof because anybody, you know, like if a teacher caught
[14:29.840 --> 14:33.400]  us all, it looked like as we were swapping calculators and even if they saw what was
[14:33.400 --> 14:37.020]  on the screen, they wouldn't be able to understand it.
[14:37.020 --> 14:38.680]  And at what grade were you guys in?
[14:38.680 --> 14:42.200]  Oh my God, this must be like 11th and 12th grade.
[14:42.200 --> 14:43.440]  Oh my God.
[14:43.440 --> 14:44.440]  That's amazing.
[14:44.440 --> 14:48.640]  It's, we talked, we were, you know, we actually were, hadn't thought about it in years, but
[14:48.640 --> 14:52.320]  we talked about it in the context of Apple watch and you know what we would have done
[14:52.320 --> 14:56.000]  if we had Apple watches when we were in 11th and 12th grade.
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.000]  Right.
[14:57.000 --> 14:58.000]  Right.
[14:58.000 --> 14:59.000]  Huh.
[14:59.000 --> 15:04.260]  I mean, it's also, it's that sort of slide three, I think that's three.
[15:04.260 --> 15:05.260]  Is it three?
[15:05.260 --> 15:06.400]  Let me see here.
[15:06.400 --> 15:07.400]  Oh yes.
[15:07.400 --> 15:09.480]  I have a visitor trying to get me on the phone right now.
[15:09.480 --> 15:10.480]  Sorry.
[15:10.480 --> 15:13.080]  I need to pause this podcast right now.
[15:13.080 --> 15:14.080]  That's fine.
[15:14.080 --> 15:15.080]  No, I don't.
[15:15.080 --> 15:16.080]  I don't really.
[15:16.080 --> 15:18.080]  If you did, you'd be fine.
[15:18.080 --> 15:21.240]  Wait, was that me?
[15:21.240 --> 15:22.240]  That was me.
[15:22.240 --> 15:23.240]  Oh my God.
[15:23.240 --> 15:24.240]  Another one just popped.
[15:24.240 --> 15:25.240]  That wasn't you.
[15:25.240 --> 15:26.240]  I'm silent.
[15:26.240 --> 15:27.560]  Because I have my headphones on too.
[15:27.560 --> 15:31.400]  So if I'm hearing them, I think I'm hearing him through my mic.
[15:31.400 --> 15:33.800]  Yeah, I'm keeping this on.
[15:33.800 --> 15:35.100]  I think this is great.
[15:35.100 --> 15:38.120]  People can get a real idea of how many alerts I get.
[15:38.120 --> 15:41.400]  Yeah, back to your, that's an amazing story.
[15:41.400 --> 15:47.440]  I mean, yeah, I think like there's also this idea of like sort of slyly communicating
[15:47.440 --> 15:49.200]  with someone when nobody else knows, right?
[15:49.200 --> 15:54.320]  And so like you were describing with the calculator or someone who's, you know, in a movie theater
[15:54.320 --> 15:56.240]  or something like that.
[15:56.240 --> 15:57.880]  It could be, it could certainly be interesting.
[15:57.880 --> 16:04.840]  I think, yeah, I mean, I made some sarcastic comments about the certain emojis, but they're
[16:04.840 --> 16:05.960]  definitely fun.
[16:05.960 --> 16:12.360]  There is a, there's a bootstrapping issue with it and whether it's teenagers or whatever,
[16:12.360 --> 16:18.000]  which is that these, the most innovative ways to communicate the drawings, the taps, the
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.740]  heartbeats are only watch to watch.
[16:20.740 --> 16:24.160]  And so the bootstrapping issue is it only works if the person you want to send these
[16:24.160 --> 16:26.760]  to also has a watch.
[16:26.760 --> 16:27.760]  And it's weird.
[16:27.760 --> 16:31.560]  And so a bunch of people wrote to me after my review came up and they said, you know,
[16:31.560 --> 16:35.480]  for this particular case, I'm surprised Apple didn't give you two so that you could have
[16:35.480 --> 16:38.880]  your wife wear one and then you could try these things out.
[16:38.880 --> 16:41.480]  And they're like, so how did you try those things?
[16:41.480 --> 16:47.200]  And the answer is we like, we're sending taps and stuff to people at Apple, Apple prep,
[16:47.200 --> 16:51.480]  you know, PR people and product marketing people.
[16:51.480 --> 16:56.760]  I did not, I will say this, I found it weird enough that I didn't want to send my heartbeat
[16:56.760 --> 16:59.560]  to anybody because it felt, I don't know.
[16:59.560 --> 17:02.040]  It just was like a little, I don't know.
[17:02.040 --> 17:03.040]  Just didn't feel right.
[17:03.040 --> 17:04.040]  A little too personal.
[17:04.040 --> 17:05.040]  Yeah.
[17:05.040 --> 17:06.040]  Yeah.
[17:06.040 --> 17:08.320]  I mean, I've been sending my heart rate to, then my heartbeat to Neelai Patel for like
[17:08.320 --> 17:09.320]  two weeks now.
[17:09.320 --> 17:12.080]  And I think it's really brought us closer together.
[17:12.080 --> 17:13.880]  That should have sent mine to Neelai too.
[17:13.880 --> 17:14.880]  That's what I should have done.
[17:14.880 --> 17:15.880]  Yeah.
[17:15.880 --> 17:18.960]  I think we are really, we've gotten to know each other on another level.
[17:18.960 --> 17:23.240]  So I sent taps to you and you ignored me.
[17:23.240 --> 17:24.700]  Did you not get them?
[17:24.700 --> 17:25.700]  Did you miss my taps?
[17:25.700 --> 17:32.720]  Man, this is like the greatest diss now of the, say I just ignored your taps.
[17:32.720 --> 17:35.440]  Get out of my face, taps.
[17:35.440 --> 17:37.560]  I don't think I knew they were from you.
[17:37.560 --> 17:40.120]  Oh, maybe they came from like a weird phone number.
[17:40.120 --> 17:41.120]  Maybe it was my phone number.
[17:41.120 --> 17:44.640]  I mean, I do like, what's your area code?
[17:44.640 --> 17:45.640]  267.
[17:45.640 --> 17:47.680]  I don't think I got that.
[17:47.680 --> 17:48.680]  Yeah.
[17:48.680 --> 17:49.680]  Because that's one thing about them.
[17:49.680 --> 17:55.720]  The other thing about all three of the watch specific communications, the doodles, the
[17:55.720 --> 17:59.880]  taps, the heartbeats, is they are ephemeral.
[17:59.880 --> 18:04.800]  And you, so another, there is no record of them.
[18:04.800 --> 18:06.840]  There's no way to go back and replay them.
[18:06.840 --> 18:11.840]  So there's a sort of Snapchat in this ephemeral quality to them.
[18:11.840 --> 18:14.000]  There is no record of them, you know, so.
[18:14.000 --> 18:17.880]  Well, they show up in your notifications, like you can go access them after the fact.
[18:17.880 --> 18:19.920]  Yeah, but then once you play it, it's gone.
[18:19.920 --> 18:23.320]  Yeah, when it's, right, it's gone.
[18:23.320 --> 18:25.280]  But I don't even think I got that from you.
[18:25.280 --> 18:26.280]  Yeah.
[18:26.280 --> 18:27.600]  Did you, did you doodle, or you just.
[18:27.600 --> 18:28.600]  I just sent you some taps.
[18:28.600 --> 18:30.600]  I'll send you some taps right now.
[18:30.600 --> 18:31.600]  Send me some taps, yeah.
[18:31.600 --> 18:35.040]  I don't, I don't think I even have your cell phone number.
[18:35.040 --> 18:36.760]  I guess you don't, you do need it.
[18:36.760 --> 18:37.760]  Yeah.
[18:37.760 --> 18:38.760]  You need iCloud, right?
[18:38.760 --> 18:39.760]  Yes.
[18:39.760 --> 18:41.600]  I also sort of broke my digital crown.
[18:41.600 --> 18:42.600]  Really?
[18:42.600 --> 18:43.600]  How?
[18:43.600 --> 18:49.880]  I, you know, in that scene in the video when I got some toothpaste, oh, up, up, tapped,
[18:49.880 --> 18:52.880]  tapped you, tapped you.
[18:52.880 --> 18:53.880]  There we go.
[18:53.880 --> 18:54.880]  Blue taps, blue taps.
[18:54.880 --> 18:55.880]  Yeah, that's me.
[18:55.880 --> 18:56.880]  I'm Mr. Blue Taps.
[18:56.880 --> 19:03.080]  I'm going to add, I'm not going to block, I'm going to add.
[19:03.080 --> 19:04.080]  Okay.
[19:04.080 --> 19:09.640]  Also, like, what can you really risk, realistically doodle on this screen, other than like high
[19:09.640 --> 19:13.840]  and a flower or a heart or a, I don't know.
[19:13.840 --> 19:19.480]  I'm not going to say what I would have done if I, when I was a teenager, but, but I would.
[19:19.480 --> 19:20.480]  Yeah, see.
[19:20.480 --> 19:21.480]  Right, right.
[19:21.480 --> 19:24.440]  It's funny though, see, I guess I didn't have your phone number, but now they're
[19:24.440 --> 19:28.080]  sending it as, right, and there it is.
[19:28.080 --> 19:30.080]  Joanna sent me a green high.
[19:30.080 --> 19:31.080]  Yeah.
[19:31.080 --> 19:34.880]  So I should add, but I got to add it here.
[19:34.880 --> 19:38.480]  I think people really appreciate this conversation right now.
[19:38.480 --> 19:39.480]  Well, I don't know.
[19:39.480 --> 19:46.720]  I think that it's, it's, I don't know what it is.
[19:46.720 --> 19:51.560]  It is, makes for a weird podcast, but I feel like it's very hard to, it's hard to, it's
[19:51.560 --> 19:54.360]  really hard to write about and maybe it's easier to talk about.
[19:54.360 --> 19:55.800]  All right.
[19:55.800 --> 20:02.760]  If you're quiet enough, maybe everyone can hear my heartbeat, right?
[20:02.760 --> 20:06.560]  I don't know, but I feel we're close enough, John, that I could send you my heartbeat right
[20:06.560 --> 20:07.560]  now.
[20:07.560 --> 20:08.560]  Sure.
[20:08.560 --> 20:09.560]  If you feel that way.
[20:09.560 --> 20:10.560]  I do have it.
[20:10.560 --> 20:15.080]  We'll see if you feel that way to return that and I will understand if you don't,
[20:15.080 --> 20:17.120]  but I won't really.
[20:17.120 --> 20:23.080]  Oh, I guess, see now I gave, see, this is where I started.
[20:23.080 --> 20:24.080]  I still get mixed up.
[20:24.080 --> 20:29.120]  I gave it a force tap and it wanted me to, yeah, no, I mean it's not, it's, it's,
[20:29.120 --> 20:34.720]  I have had a hard time getting it to catch my heartbeat when I do that because it's
[20:34.720 --> 20:38.300]  not like also I have the smaller screen, so I'm putting two fingers on the screen, which
[20:38.300 --> 20:43.340]  basically takes up the whole screen up.
[20:43.340 --> 20:44.440]  He did it, everybody.
[20:44.440 --> 20:51.320]  He sent me his heartbeat.
[20:51.320 --> 20:52.440]  I don't know if you can hear it.
[20:52.440 --> 20:53.760]  No, I think it's hard to hear.
[20:53.760 --> 20:54.760]  Well, who knows?
[20:54.760 --> 20:59.400]  We had to like, when we filmed the video, we stuck the mic in it and actually got it,
[20:59.400 --> 21:03.200]  but that, um, that to me though, I, I'm telling you that to me is, is one that's
[21:03.200 --> 21:04.200]  going to work.
[21:04.200 --> 21:07.120]  I think that people, I think people are going to use it.
[21:07.120 --> 21:08.600]  Yeah, probably.
[21:08.600 --> 21:10.760]  It's just a way of saying, Hey, I'm thinking about you.
[21:10.760 --> 21:11.760]  Right.
[21:11.760 --> 21:12.760]  Right.
[21:12.760 --> 21:13.760]  Oh, certainly.
[21:13.760 --> 21:15.840]  If it's a, if it's someone close to you.
[21:15.840 --> 21:16.840]  Right.
[21:16.840 --> 21:20.800]  But I think, I think, I think there's, that's like a, something that I didn't
[21:20.800 --> 21:24.280]  get to talk about in my review and something I've been thinking about, like as more and
[21:24.280 --> 21:27.120]  more people wear these sort of like the iPhone, right?
[21:27.120 --> 21:31.120]  Like the iPhone became a really powerful tool as more and more people got them, right?
[21:31.120 --> 21:35.040]  Not only cause more apps came out, but even just in terms of communicating, I message
[21:35.040 --> 21:36.040]  was one thing.
[21:36.040 --> 21:39.600]  Like to me, I message is such a huge part of my life, even though I don't really think
[21:39.600 --> 21:41.600]  about it.
[21:41.600 --> 21:45.460]  But it's part of the thing that sort of, that's how I communicate with everyone all
[21:45.460 --> 21:46.460]  day long.
[21:46.460 --> 21:51.640]  My colleagues, my friends, my family, and the same sort of thing with the watch, right?
[21:51.640 --> 21:55.360]  Like if more and more people have this, there might be, there are going to become these
[21:55.360 --> 21:59.640]  ways where we can connect to those other people that have them.
[21:59.640 --> 22:02.000]  And actually one thing I've been thinking about, and you know, I wrote this piece a
[22:02.000 --> 22:07.640]  couple like a year ago, a year ago now about business cards and like I want there to be
[22:07.640 --> 22:12.200]  some easy way where if you see another person with an Apple watch, you can easily sort of
[22:12.200 --> 22:16.960]  transmit information or their contact information like a handshake.
[22:16.960 --> 22:20.280]  You know what I've been saying about this for years, ever since the iPhone came out,
[22:20.280 --> 22:24.380]  like one of the weird things about the iPhone is that there's nothing like that.
[22:24.380 --> 22:26.520]  And the Newton had it.
[22:26.520 --> 22:29.680]  And I know people mock the Newton, but the Newton had a thing where if you met somebody
[22:29.680 --> 22:33.800]  else who had a Newton, all you had to do was point your IR ports at each other and it was
[22:33.800 --> 22:37.960]  like two taps away and you'd exchange contact cards.
[22:37.960 --> 22:42.600]  And it was, you know, say what you want about the Newton, it was one of the things that
[22:42.600 --> 22:43.780]  worked great.
[22:43.780 --> 22:44.780]  And it seemed like something...
[22:44.780 --> 22:47.320]  I love the idea of pointing your IR ports together.
[22:47.320 --> 22:50.560]  It seemed like something you should be able to do and you could do it and it worked.
[22:50.560 --> 22:54.960]  And yet here we are in 2015 and you still can't do it with, even if you both have iPhones,
[22:54.960 --> 22:58.960]  let alone some way to do it where it would work with anybody's phone.
[22:58.960 --> 23:03.040]  And that was one of the things I said about the iPhone 6 when it came out with NFC was
[23:03.040 --> 23:07.020]  okay, it's great for payments, but like kind of wish there were more things you could do
[23:07.020 --> 23:09.440]  when you put this in contact with another phone.
[23:09.440 --> 23:15.000]  And obviously Android's done some things with their Beam and no one really uses that, but
[23:15.000 --> 23:18.800]  it seems like, you know, especially with Apple products and iPhones, like there is this sort
[23:18.800 --> 23:23.360]  of community around using the same thing.
[23:23.360 --> 23:27.200]  It just seems like I would love it if I could shake someone's hand and we could exchange
[23:27.200 --> 23:28.320]  contact info.
[23:28.320 --> 23:33.120]  I'd also like see so much potential in the social realm for this.
[23:33.120 --> 23:37.760]  Like as much as I see it as being a social norm disruptor and I have a lot of thoughts
[23:37.760 --> 23:42.840]  about that, but I think like for me, I also want some sort of app that like I go to a
[23:42.840 --> 23:46.920]  party or I go to a meeting and it tells me who that person is.
[23:46.920 --> 23:52.860]  Again, lots of privacy concerns about that, but like I would love it if I'm at CES or
[23:52.860 --> 23:56.800]  some conference and someone comes up to me and says, Joanna, it's so great to see you.
[23:56.800 --> 23:58.600]  That person's wearing an Apple watch.
[23:58.600 --> 24:00.280]  I'm wearing an Apple watch.
[24:00.280 --> 24:06.080]  Couldn't it say, Oh yeah, that's a John Gruber, right?
[24:06.080 --> 24:09.320]  It seems like, I mean, there's a lot of privacy concerns, but it's just like one thing that
[24:09.320 --> 24:10.800]  I could really use in my life.
[24:10.800 --> 24:12.280]  Yeah, I don't know.
[24:12.280 --> 24:18.920]  There could be some kind of way where it would be sort of like airdrop where with airdrop
[24:18.920 --> 24:22.520]  you can say contacts only or you can say everyone.
[24:22.520 --> 24:30.320]  And then if you were in a situation like, uh, you know, like a cocktail party or some
[24:30.320 --> 24:36.560]  kind of your, you know, you're at a conference or a post of event press thing and you're
[24:36.560 --> 24:38.480]  mingling, but you know, you want to meet people.
[24:38.480 --> 24:43.520]  You could set, you could change it to, you know, open to anybody and then turn it off
[24:43.520 --> 24:47.780]  or even it could even be like the sort of thing where it would, it would say like, Hey,
[24:47.780 --> 24:48.780]  for how long?
[24:48.780 --> 24:52.960]  Maybe for the next two hours and then go back to being contacts only.
[24:52.960 --> 24:56.080]  It seems like it's, you know, like airdrop shows how you can kind of solve that sort
[24:56.080 --> 25:01.200]  of issue though, where you know, you may not want to be open to the general public all
[25:01.200 --> 25:06.720]  the time, but temporarily you might want to be actually at the, at the Apple watch launch
[25:06.720 --> 25:14.380]  event, the one in March, uh, I forget, like here I, I forget his name, uh, somebody, somebody
[25:14.380 --> 25:21.060]  air dropped me a photo of them playing with the new Mac book and it just like showed up
[25:21.060 --> 25:23.920]  cause I guess I had my thing on everyone and I wouldn't think about it.
[25:23.920 --> 25:24.920]  I accepted it.
[25:24.920 --> 25:28.820]  Like it said, like so and so wants to airdrop you a photo and I accepted it and it was,
[25:28.820 --> 25:29.820]  it was fun.
[25:29.820 --> 25:32.660]  I mean, in some ways I could see like I didn't really know what I was going to get before
[25:32.660 --> 25:33.660]  I opened it.
[25:33.660 --> 25:38.600]  So yeah, but it's, it's definitely fun.
[25:38.600 --> 25:41.720]  Let me, those are my deep thoughts on that.
[25:41.720 --> 25:46.080]  Let me, let me take a break at this point and thank the show's first sponsor and it's
[25:46.080 --> 25:48.000]  our good friends at fracture.
[25:48.000 --> 25:54.300]  You guys know fracture, you go to the website, fracture me.com and they take your photos
[25:54.300 --> 25:56.660]  and print them on glass.
[25:56.660 --> 25:57.660]  So here's what I want you to do.
[25:57.660 --> 25:58.660]  Go this, do this.
[25:58.660 --> 26:03.640]  I keep saying this, they've sponsored the show all quarter long, um, and people keep
[26:03.640 --> 26:06.620]  signing up, but I don't understand why people haven't already done it.
[26:06.620 --> 26:12.220]  Go through your phone, find your best picture from the last month and send it to fracture,
[26:12.220 --> 26:15.940]  get it printed out and hang it up on your wall and see just how nice it is to have your
[26:15.940 --> 26:19.660]  pictures in the real world off these digital devices.
[26:19.660 --> 26:24.700]  Um, it's so great and I think that, uh, ever since I've been using fracture, it really
[26:24.700 --> 26:30.740]  has reminded me of how much I like having my pictures in analog form.
[26:30.740 --> 26:34.940]  Um, back when our son was born, I just said earlier in the show, he's 11, I was still
[26:34.940 --> 26:36.700]  shooting film 10 years ago.
[26:36.700 --> 26:42.620]  I didn't really switch over to digital photography until like 2006 or so.
[26:42.620 --> 26:48.480]  Um, and we were just looking through a photo album of actual prints of photos from like
[26:48.480 --> 26:54.900]  10 years ago and it's just an amazing thing and it's, it has a different feel to it.
[26:54.900 --> 27:00.880]  Um, so fracture, they print your photos directly on glass, not a piece of paper stuck to glass.
[27:00.880 --> 27:01.880]  I don't know what they do.
[27:01.880 --> 27:08.300]  You've got some kind of magical machine that prints photos on glass and so you end up with
[27:08.300 --> 27:13.440]  an analog photo, a piece of glass you can hang on the wall, you can put on your desk.
[27:13.440 --> 27:17.700]  That's just the glass with the photo on it like a, like the way the retina screens are
[27:17.700 --> 27:19.940]  laminated to, to your devices.
[27:19.940 --> 27:26.100]  Uh, and it comes in these great cardboard shipping containers that as you take them
[27:26.100 --> 27:32.600]  apart, what's left is all you need to, uh, prop it up like an easel on your desk or a
[27:32.600 --> 27:37.540]  shelf or with the stuff on the back where you can get a hole and have it hang on the
[27:37.540 --> 27:41.020]  wall and you don't need a frame, you don't need to put a frame around it.
[27:41.020 --> 27:44.060]  It's just border to border, no frame.
[27:44.060 --> 27:45.100]  It just looks great.
[27:45.100 --> 27:52.660]  It's just a perfect photo edge to edge with great quality, super great, um, color reproduction.
[27:52.660 --> 27:57.700]  Uh, I just, it's the best analog printouts of digital photos that I've ever seen.
[27:57.700 --> 28:02.480]  It just, it's as good as you can imagine them, um, really, really great stuff.
[28:02.480 --> 28:03.820]  So my thanks to them.
[28:03.820 --> 28:04.820]  And here's the deal.
[28:04.820 --> 28:09.680]  If you use the code for the show, it's daring fireball, all one word, daring fireball.
[28:09.680 --> 28:15.380]  You save 15% off any order and their prices are already great and they have all these,
[28:15.380 --> 28:20.740]  any size you can imagine from like little three by three squares all the way up to giant
[28:20.740 --> 28:23.840]  23 by 27 inch rectangles.
[28:23.840 --> 28:29.220]  So go check them out at fracture me.com and print, get one of your photos printed and
[28:29.220 --> 28:31.460]  just see, see how good it is.
[28:31.460 --> 28:37.060]  I'm doing this right now, by the way, don't want you to pay me, I'm not even joking.
[28:37.060 --> 28:41.740]  I mean it looks like, okay, I just figured out what I'm getting my mom for Mother's Day.
[28:41.740 --> 28:46.860]  Um, I told my mom that after we got married this year that pretty much for the next 10
[28:46.860 --> 28:51.740]  years she was going to get photos from the wedding, she's like, Oh, here's another year.
[28:51.740 --> 28:53.880]  Here's another version of the photo that you had last year.
[28:53.880 --> 28:57.240]  It is a surefire Mother's Day gift for any, it really is.
[28:57.240 --> 28:58.580]  So this is like a great way.
[28:58.580 --> 29:02.500]  It's like, here's the photo we gave you for, for your birthday a couple months ago, but
[29:02.500 --> 29:05.660]  now look, it's on glass.
[29:05.660 --> 29:09.220]  They this thing looks great actually, and also I want to get one for my office.
[29:09.220 --> 29:11.020]  They're really, really great stuff.
[29:11.020 --> 29:15.060]  Um, one of the things that struck me about your review, still talking about the watch,
[29:15.060 --> 29:18.140]  and something that we're not talking about fracture, but something that I couldn't test.
[29:18.140 --> 29:24.160]  I know I just because I don't know, but how accurate some of the heartbeat like the heartbeat
[29:24.160 --> 29:25.160]  stuff is.
[29:25.160 --> 29:30.220]  And I thought that was really interesting because you have a dedicated heartbeat monitor
[29:30.220 --> 29:35.680]  that you strap it around your chest, and then you can wear it when you work out and, and
[29:35.680 --> 29:41.300]  you've done tests before for the journal where you what, what was your conclusion?
[29:41.300 --> 29:45.180]  It was the closest thing you've seen to like the accuracy of an EKG.
[29:45.180 --> 29:46.180]  Yeah.
[29:46.180 --> 29:49.620]  So a couple months ago I did this huge project and I'm actually like so happy I did it at
[29:49.620 --> 29:50.620]  the time.
[29:50.620 --> 29:51.620]  No one really cared.
[29:51.620 --> 29:54.620]  But, but now it was, it was actually really looking back on it was something I'm really
[29:54.620 --> 29:55.620]  happy we did.
[29:55.620 --> 30:00.100]  Um, I looked at, so it was when the Microsoft band came out, Basis's band had just come
[30:00.100 --> 30:05.160]  out and it's just like, I kept getting these readings where it was like, yeah, I, I certainly
[30:05.160 --> 30:07.460]  don't think my heart rate is at 120 right now.
[30:07.460 --> 30:09.460]  It was all like walking to work.
[30:09.460 --> 30:12.840]  But I actually at some points was like, maybe there's something wrong with my heart.
[30:12.840 --> 30:18.060]  So anyway, I had started testing these and so I went to my, my general practitioner who
[30:18.060 --> 30:22.380]  actually happens to also be a cardiologist and she did a whole full heart rate work,
[30:22.380 --> 30:27.220]  a heart workup and turns out I'm perfectly fine, which was very, very good to know.
[30:27.220 --> 30:31.580]  And she also, we also did an EKG where you can sort of, you know, run on the treadmill
[30:31.580 --> 30:36.060]  and have all these electrodes, I don't even know if that's the right term, hooked up to
[30:36.060 --> 30:38.580]  your chest and your back and all over you.
[30:38.580 --> 30:39.580]  They are electrodes.
[30:39.580 --> 30:42.540]  Yeah, I think that, yeah, it sounds about right.
[30:42.540 --> 30:45.100]  Anyway, so she, um, she had that, right.
[30:45.100 --> 30:46.820]  And so that was sort of the constant.
[30:46.820 --> 30:52.820]  And, uh, I then also used at the same time compared the Microsoft band, the Basis band,
[30:52.820 --> 30:56.980]  a polar chest rate, chest strap monitor.
[30:56.980 --> 31:00.660]  And um, I believe the Fitbit was, was the other one that I used.
[31:00.660 --> 31:05.340]  I should pull up this article and, um, you know, found that one of the things we found
[31:05.340 --> 31:09.740]  across all of them was that just, it took them quite a while to catch up to what the,
[31:09.740 --> 31:11.740]  my heart rate actually was.
[31:11.740 --> 31:14.740]  And so that was kind of the problem that I was seeing when I'd see these irregularities.
[31:14.740 --> 31:19.220]  You know, if it would say I was at 120 beats per minute, that might've been where I was
[31:19.220 --> 31:24.460]  actually like 10 minutes ago or 20, like, you know, it just wasn't catching up in real
[31:24.460 --> 31:25.460]  time.
[31:25.460 --> 31:30.300]  And so, um, really I, you know, sort of called out these companies for saying just this is
[31:30.300 --> 31:31.420]  not unacceptable.
[31:31.420 --> 31:35.300]  Like we shouldn't be, you shouldn't be surfacing information to people that just isn't right.
[31:35.300 --> 31:41.540]  Um, and so the thing that did come the closest to the EKG was a polar chest strap monitor.
[31:41.540 --> 31:45.300]  The um, I'll pull up the actual one right now.
[31:45.300 --> 31:48.700]  It's the H7, which works with their polar loop band.
[31:48.700 --> 31:53.940]  And so that was like really, really, really in line with what I was seeing with the EKG.
[31:53.940 --> 31:59.380]  And so, um, when I was testing the Apple watch, I compared the Apple watch during a cycling
[31:59.380 --> 32:05.680]  class and during a few runs to that same polar chest strap monitor and found that, um, during,
[32:05.680 --> 32:08.520]  during those workouts it was actually really in line.
[32:08.520 --> 32:13.300]  It was only a couple beats off, you know, usually in the range of five from the polar.
[32:13.300 --> 32:16.340]  Um, and so that was, that was really impressive to me.
[32:16.340 --> 32:19.940]  The big thing that Apple says they're doing, right, is they're, um, they've got a really
[32:19.940 --> 32:22.380]  good fit with the sport band on.
[32:22.380 --> 32:27.500]  They also say their algorithms are sort of working to flush out things that might not
[32:27.500 --> 32:28.540]  be right.
[32:28.540 --> 32:33.740]  And so, um, that, you know, also when you're working out, it's constantly taking the
[32:33.740 --> 32:37.740]  heart rate versus when you're not working out, it's taking it every 10 minutes.
[32:37.740 --> 32:41.820]  So I definitely did notice at times I'd look down and, you know, at the glances and
[32:41.820 --> 32:45.860]  see, okay, my heart rate, like for instance right now says it's 61 beats per minute.
[32:45.860 --> 32:49.300]  Um, you know, that's probably seems about right.
[32:49.300 --> 32:54.580]  My resting heart rate's around 55 beats per minute and, um, but you know, now it's measuring
[32:54.580 --> 32:59.100]  so it could be off and I'm also, you know, talking quickly now so it could be higher.
[32:59.100 --> 33:03.220]  But yeah, I mean, that was something I wanted to make sure was, was right.
[33:03.220 --> 33:07.420]  And I think Apple did a really good job of, of getting that aspect right.
[33:07.420 --> 33:08.420]  Yeah.
[33:08.420 --> 33:12.860]  I, I think I'm in bad shape because mine's usually around 70, which seems high for resting
[33:12.860 --> 33:13.860]  pulse.
[33:13.860 --> 33:16.700]  Um, I think it's, I think that's okay.
[33:16.700 --> 33:22.380]  I mean, mine fluctuates like throughout the day of normal from sort of being 50 to 80
[33:22.380 --> 33:23.380]  something.
[33:23.380 --> 33:28.940]  You know, it depends on your nerves, depends on if you've walked around, depend on a lot
[33:28.940 --> 33:29.940]  of things.
[33:29.940 --> 33:30.940]  I just tried it right now.
[33:30.940 --> 33:31.940]  69, 68 just went down.
[33:31.940 --> 33:32.940]  Yeah.
[33:32.940 --> 33:33.940]  I'm relaxing.
[33:33.940 --> 33:34.940]  Right.
[33:34.940 --> 33:35.940]  Yeah.
[33:35.940 --> 33:36.940]  I relaxed.
[33:36.940 --> 33:37.940]  Yeah.
[33:37.940 --> 33:40.980]  I mean, um, I knew that was like a big thing for me going into this because I have been
[33:40.980 --> 33:45.940]  looking for a device that I can wear all day long and also work out with.
[33:45.940 --> 33:51.820]  And so yes, you've got to switch this band, which is a little bit annoying, especially
[33:51.820 --> 33:55.220]  given what I talked about with my sport band thing, but that's, I mean, you know, I can't
[33:55.220 --> 33:57.140]  say that's going to affect too many people.
[33:57.140 --> 33:59.300]  Um, and you know, Apple seems to get around it.
[33:59.300 --> 34:03.660]  My big thing with the, with it is just, it's not doing enough with that data yet.
[34:03.660 --> 34:06.580]  And that's, I think where the potential of the platform is.
[34:06.580 --> 34:07.700]  Uh, we can go there.
[34:07.700 --> 34:11.260]  I think we should talk about it because it's, to me, this is the part that I explored the
[34:11.260 --> 34:16.780]  least in my review because I'm not into fitness and combined with that, even just little things
[34:16.780 --> 34:21.380]  like with this stupid, I think I've got until I actually just until yesterday I was restricted
[34:21.380 --> 34:25.220]  from any kind of vigorous workout, like, so all I could do, the only thing I was allowed
[34:25.220 --> 34:29.220]  to do was walk, which is one of the activities you can do.
[34:29.220 --> 34:33.140]  And I do realize, you know, whether you're older or, or, you know, you have other conditions,
[34:33.140 --> 34:37.100]  maybe a, you know, a outdoor walk is the most vigorous thing you can do.
[34:37.100 --> 34:40.500]  So it's good that it's on the watch, but it really felt like as a reviewer, I was doing
[34:40.500 --> 34:45.500]  very little credit to it as a, as a fitness device by going for a walk.
[34:45.500 --> 34:50.380]  No, I mean, people go for, I know, but I don't like, there's more I could have done.
[34:50.380 --> 34:51.380]  I'm looking.
[34:51.380 --> 34:52.380]  Yeah.
[34:52.380 --> 34:59.100]  Yeah, I do feel I feel like it's not just lip service from Apple that they took it seriously
[34:59.100 --> 35:00.500]  as a fitness device.
[35:00.500 --> 35:05.900]  Like I feel like them billing it as, as a full one third of their primary use cases
[35:05.900 --> 35:06.900]  for it.
[35:06.900 --> 35:08.860]  They're totally serious about it.
[35:08.860 --> 35:13.940]  Like could not be more serious, that it's not just a watch that happens to do some of
[35:13.940 --> 35:18.820]  the fitness stuff haphazardly like they are dead serious about dominant, you know, even
[35:18.820 --> 35:24.820]  if the main thing you're looking for is a fitness tracking device, Apple Watch is the
[35:24.820 --> 35:27.660]  thing that you should is something you should consider.
[35:27.660 --> 35:33.300]  Yeah, and I that's something I shared in my review, you know, I felt when I started tackling
[35:33.300 --> 35:36.100]  this device, like, you sort of have to make it your own.
[35:36.100 --> 35:40.980]  And it is very confusing to me at a lot of points, there's so much going on.
[35:40.980 --> 35:45.460]  And one of the things I knew I wanted it to be was a fitness tracker, both as sort of
[35:45.460 --> 35:48.540]  like a everyday fitness tracker throughout my day.
[35:48.540 --> 35:53.160]  But also for these exercise classes that I do a couple of times a week and have gotten
[35:53.160 --> 35:54.300]  really into.
[35:54.300 --> 35:57.700]  So like, I really wanted to road test it in those.
[35:57.700 --> 35:59.380]  And I felt like, yeah, this thing's great.
[35:59.380 --> 36:01.980]  And that's, that's ultimately why I'm going to buy the sport.
[36:01.980 --> 36:06.020]  Because I actually again, yesterday went to another class and just loved having it on
[36:06.020 --> 36:10.980]  loved having sort of a baseline and knowing now as I collect more and more data where
[36:10.980 --> 36:14.540]  I'm sort of, you know, working hard or not hard.
[36:14.540 --> 36:17.700]  And that's, I mean, that's, again, about the potential, I think there's a lot Apple could
[36:17.700 --> 36:19.860]  really do with that information.
[36:19.860 --> 36:25.740]  The activity app to me seems like a very, very basic Gen one product and whether Apple
[36:25.740 --> 36:31.220]  decides to use that data or some other third party, there's a lot of potential there.
[36:31.220 --> 36:32.700]  The joys of urban living.
[36:32.700 --> 36:34.700]  Yeah, you like that?
[36:34.700 --> 36:38.480]  I live on a street where the ambulances go by all the time.
[36:38.480 --> 36:42.220]  So the talk show is usually riddled with with ambulances.
[36:42.220 --> 36:45.820]  One of the Yeah, well, it's look New York, we have not been able to open the windows
[36:45.820 --> 36:47.100]  here for months.
[36:47.100 --> 36:50.180]  And so the windows open and I'm not closing it.
[36:50.180 --> 36:51.180]  But yeah, it's amazing.
[36:51.180 --> 36:57.500]  I mean, yeah, it's happy to say I can actually live a decent life right now in New York without
[36:57.500 --> 37:00.700]  it being freezing cold.
[37:00.700 --> 37:05.220]  We open our windows like with the temperature we're like people in California would would
[37:05.220 --> 37:10.460]  be like wearing coats, right rain the heat up.
[37:10.460 --> 37:14.040]  I think some of the interesting stuff that Apple has done so I know the biggest knock
[37:14.040 --> 37:20.460]  against this, the first Apple Watch is the lack of or from a fitness perspective is the
[37:20.460 --> 37:21.980]  lack of GPS.
[37:21.980 --> 37:28.020]  People who run want GPS tracking people who cycle definitely want GPS tracking.
[37:28.020 --> 37:30.100]  And I have friends who are serious about both things.
[37:30.100 --> 37:34.120]  And they use you know, whatever devices they do use, they do things where they get like
[37:34.120 --> 37:38.900]  a map that shows them exactly where they went at what pace and that important to them and
[37:38.900 --> 37:42.900]  anything that doesn't have GPS isn't going to replace what they've already got.
[37:42.900 --> 37:47.380]  And that means that they're stuck, still carrying their iPhone around with them.
[37:47.380 --> 37:50.880]  And if you're already carrying your iPhone around for your cycling or for your running,
[37:50.880 --> 37:52.980]  then what's the point of even having a watch?
[37:52.980 --> 37:54.380]  It doesn't does it make a difference?
[37:54.380 --> 37:55.680]  Well, there's some little things, right?
[37:55.680 --> 37:59.260]  It's going to give you a much it's going to give you a heartbeat heartbeat monitoring
[37:59.260 --> 38:02.620]  that you don't get from the phone.
[38:02.620 --> 38:03.720]  But that's definitely a knock.
[38:03.720 --> 38:06.980]  But they've tried to do the way they've explained and I don't know how accurate is but that
[38:06.980 --> 38:12.220]  if you go for a run with your phone a couple times, yep.
[38:12.220 --> 38:16.260]  And it knows how tall you are, you've entered in your height and your weight.
[38:16.260 --> 38:19.460]  It kind of gets a sense of your stride, you do a workout, you say I'm going to go for
[38:19.460 --> 38:24.980]  a run and you do it with your phone and it has GPS, then you can start doing it without
[38:24.980 --> 38:31.040]  your phone and it extrapolates it knows well, we know what you know, his stride is and we
[38:31.040 --> 38:33.160]  know how tall he is and how much he weighs.
[38:33.160 --> 38:34.200]  And so it makes some guesses.
[38:34.200 --> 38:37.660]  It's still not going to give you a map without GPS, but it's going to give you a much better
[38:37.660 --> 38:39.700]  sense of the distance that you've gone.
[38:39.700 --> 38:44.540]  Yeah, and I found that to be pretty accurate after I'd gone for like last I mean, the week
[38:44.540 --> 38:49.740]  of testing this thing and all the craziness I like was basically going for like two runs
[38:49.740 --> 38:54.460]  a day plus a spinning class, which was just insane.
[38:54.460 --> 38:59.380]  And I found one of the runs I did, you know, I just sort of knew how long the path was.
[38:59.380 --> 39:05.400]  And so when I just took the watch on the run, and this experience I have talked about now
[39:05.400 --> 39:10.140]  in a number of podcasts and talked about on in the review just took the watch for a run,
[39:10.140 --> 39:14.460]  it pretty much very, it was very, very close to saying that it was a two mile run, which
[39:14.460 --> 39:17.220]  I knew it pretty much was.
[39:17.220 --> 39:22.580]  And you know, I just I thought that experience was great, because I had just left with the
[39:22.580 --> 39:23.580]  watch.
[39:23.580 --> 39:27.020]  I preloaded the watch with a playlist, which was a little bit of a clunky experience, but
[39:27.020 --> 39:28.020]  I got it to work.
[39:28.020 --> 39:30.720]  I had Bluetooth, a Bluetooth headset paired to it.
[39:30.720 --> 39:35.820]  And then I stopped at Whole Foods bought a coffee and water and ran home, which was like,
[39:35.820 --> 39:40.380]  just this really freeing experience, because I actually hate having my phone with me when
[39:40.380 --> 39:41.380]  I run.
[39:41.380 --> 39:45.540]  It's like, yeah, I mean, I've been said at the piece, it was like, what I think the
[39:45.540 --> 39:50.960]  Apple Watch can disrupt, like working out as if like, what the iPad did, the iPod did,
[39:50.960 --> 39:54.620]  when we had to run with disk, you know, like, it was, we used to have to run with these
[39:54.620 --> 39:55.620]  clunky things.
[39:55.620 --> 39:58.860]  And yes, it's crazy, like, oh, yeah, we're complaining about a phone we have to hold
[39:58.860 --> 39:59.860]  or put on our arm.
[39:59.860 --> 40:03.100]  But it is it's, it's annoying.
[40:03.100 --> 40:04.980]  So yeah, that was like a great experience.
[40:04.980 --> 40:11.260]  I think that a Discman might be the last portable Sony product that I've ever bought, I think
[40:11.260 --> 40:15.760]  and I remember being so happy with it, because it didn't skip that Sony had done this remarkable
[40:15.760 --> 40:20.600]  engineering that you could go running with a spinning CD and it didn't skip, which
[40:20.600 --> 40:21.600]  was amazing.
[40:21.600 --> 40:26.260]  It had those crazy plastic things on the side, you'd like enclose it.
[40:26.260 --> 40:28.180]  I remember reading about it.
[40:28.180 --> 40:30.220]  It was this is pre daring fireball way pre day.
[40:30.220 --> 40:31.900]  I mean, this must have been late 90s or something.
[40:31.900 --> 40:33.740]  But I remember reading about how they did it.
[40:33.740 --> 40:34.740]  And it was pretty cool.
[40:34.740 --> 40:38.940]  It was a little bit of buffering and a little bit of like shock absorption, you know, to
[40:38.940 --> 40:43.200]  keep the thing on but it was a crazy achievement.
[40:43.200 --> 40:47.100]  But yeah, I mean, still even even so even though it didn't skip it was a crazy large
[40:47.100 --> 40:51.860]  device to have to be saddled with while while going for a run.
[40:51.860 --> 40:52.860]  Right?
[40:52.860 --> 40:55.900]  Yeah, phone still feels Yeah, I mean, the phone feels that way.
[40:55.900 --> 41:01.420]  I mean, yeah, it's like, I mean, it does sound like a first world problem for sure.
[41:01.420 --> 41:06.940]  But it's just nice to have both hands and like, I mean, also, this is the first time
[41:06.940 --> 41:12.060]  I really started running with the Bluetooth headset that actually stuck in like, in my
[41:12.060 --> 41:13.060]  ears.
[41:13.060 --> 41:14.060]  I've been using this these beats.
[41:14.060 --> 41:15.060]  What are they called?
[41:15.060 --> 41:16.060]  Power beats.
[41:16.060 --> 41:17.060]  I think I got the same ones.
[41:17.060 --> 41:18.060]  Do they have a red?
[41:18.060 --> 41:19.060]  Yeah, a red cable.
[41:19.060 --> 41:20.060]  That's the ones.
[41:20.060 --> 41:21.060]  I got those.
[41:21.060 --> 41:25.220]  Yeah, I mean, I feel like a little bit of a douchebag when I run with them.
[41:25.220 --> 41:27.620]  But you know, you always look like I mean, there's no way to look good.
[41:27.620 --> 41:29.100]  I always look like a douchebag.
[41:29.100 --> 41:30.100]  You're right.
[41:30.100 --> 41:34.300]  There's nothing you can do that to not look stupid when you're running.
[41:34.300 --> 41:36.100]  I mean, you know, right.
[41:36.100 --> 41:38.940]  Everybody's wearing tight clothes and you got something in your ears.
[41:38.940 --> 41:39.940]  Now I got the same beats.
[41:39.940 --> 41:43.740]  The only thing I don't like about them is the latency and then but I did the research
[41:43.740 --> 41:46.380]  beforehand and everybody says they all have the latency.
[41:46.380 --> 41:47.380]  Yeah, exactly.
[41:47.380 --> 41:50.260]  I mean, and like the battery life is really good on them.
[41:50.260 --> 41:52.780]  I haven't charged it for like two weeks, like a week and a half now.
[41:52.780 --> 41:56.060]  I mean, I guess granted, I've only five really five.
[41:56.060 --> 41:58.780]  It's got to be more than that.
[41:58.780 --> 41:59.780]  Is it?
[41:59.780 --> 42:00.780]  I don't know.
[42:00.780 --> 42:01.780]  It's the fifth one I've heard.
[42:01.780 --> 42:02.780]  Yeah.
[42:02.780 --> 42:06.940]  I mean, so my one of my frustrations with notifications is that if I was using mail
[42:06.940 --> 42:14.380]  on my computer, I wouldn't be getting as many right because if I'm open, if I have mail
[42:14.380 --> 42:19.940]  open on my iPhone, and I'm looking at emails, I don't get them on my phone on my watch as
[42:19.940 --> 42:25.180]  I, or at least they don't, they fade to the background, you know, on my laptop.
[42:25.180 --> 42:31.340]  I use Outlook and they don't write because it's not hooked up to the, the right, I
[42:31.340 --> 42:34.940]  messaged whatever.
[42:34.940 --> 42:35.940]  I do think it works.
[42:35.940 --> 42:40.340]  I think that the running with the or, you know, I've gone for walks without the phone
[42:40.340 --> 42:42.580]  and with the Bluetooth.
[42:42.580 --> 42:43.580]  And it's freeing.
[42:43.580 --> 42:44.580]  It's definitely freeing.
[42:44.580 --> 42:48.420]  And and in addition to that, and again, this has nothing to do with the watch in particular,
[42:48.420 --> 42:51.020]  that just happened to be, you know, is the thing that was like, well, I've got it to
[42:51.020 --> 42:54.420]  test it, I have to have Bluetooth head, you know, earbuds.
[42:54.420 --> 42:57.900]  So I'll buy some finally break down and buy some, it would be just as true if I didn't
[42:57.900 --> 42:58.900]  have the watch.
[42:58.900 --> 43:03.700]  But it is, it is as freeing as I expected not to have a cable connecting me to from
[43:03.700 --> 43:05.460]  my ears to the thing.
[43:05.460 --> 43:09.660]  And while working out, it's, you know, or running or whatever, it's, it's definitely
[43:09.660 --> 43:10.660]  it.
[43:10.660 --> 43:11.660]  It feels like the future.
[43:11.660 --> 43:13.980]  They've got to get the somehow somebody's got to invent something to get the latency
[43:13.980 --> 43:14.980]  down there.
[43:14.980 --> 43:15.980]  Yeah.
[43:15.980 --> 43:21.260]  And I mean, I think the GPS thing, not having it in the watch, you know, the Microsoft band
[43:21.260 --> 43:26.060]  has GPS, and that's what kills the battery.
[43:26.060 --> 43:31.600]  You know, already the the battery life is is takes a big hit when you're working out
[43:31.600 --> 43:32.600]  with this thing on.
[43:32.600 --> 43:33.600]  Yeah.
[43:33.600 --> 43:38.940]  And it's to me, it's exactly like, analogous to the original iPhone not having three G,
[43:38.940 --> 43:43.980]  which was, you know, clearly a lot of the top flight phones in 2007, we're all coming
[43:43.980 --> 43:46.700]  out with three G, and the iPhone didn't.
[43:46.700 --> 43:50.420]  And Apple, I, you know, it was one of the cases where they were, they just said, why
[43:50.420 --> 43:53.980]  they said, well, it would, you know, it would kill the battery.
[43:53.980 --> 43:57.420]  You know, we don't, we couldn't, we don't, you know, we don't have a way to do it in
[43:57.420 --> 44:02.140]  a way that sustains the battery life we were hoping for yet.
[44:02.140 --> 44:05.940]  So clearly, it's going to come I mean, I would say of all the things people are thinking
[44:05.940 --> 44:12.340]  about for future Apple Watch revisions, GPS, I think is a sure thing, but it's just a question
[44:12.340 --> 44:14.140]  of battery life.
[44:14.140 --> 44:15.140]  Right.
[44:15.140 --> 44:16.140]  Yeah.
[44:16.140 --> 44:19.660]  So you had, here's another thing from your review that was interesting to me is that
[44:19.660 --> 44:23.580]  on the days that you exercised your watches battery died.
[44:23.580 --> 44:25.620]  Yeah, I thought that was interesting.
[44:25.620 --> 44:28.700]  I didn't have a single day where the watches battery died.
[44:28.700 --> 44:33.260]  But but I have not been working out in any way.
[44:33.260 --> 44:34.620]  Right.
[44:34.620 --> 44:39.960]  So the, so I tried to divide up the testing because I knew the last couple of days would
[44:39.960 --> 44:46.300]  be really not a good indicator of normal life because I'd be shooting video with it so much.
[44:46.300 --> 44:53.460]  But the first, the first three days, I basically made it to the end of the day, you know, within
[44:53.460 --> 44:58.940]  the I'd say 15% mark and I was fine by the time I went to bed.
[44:58.940 --> 45:04.700]  But a day I did two workouts is certainly had it was it was pretty much in power reserve
[45:04.700 --> 45:07.020]  mode by 8pm.
[45:07.020 --> 45:12.680]  And one of the things I did during my cycling workout was I did keep the screen on for quite
[45:12.680 --> 45:13.680]  a bit of time.
[45:13.680 --> 45:16.200]  And so that hit really took a hit on it.
[45:16.200 --> 45:21.660]  The reason I did that was one of the things you talked about in your review, you know,
[45:21.660 --> 45:30.060]  because my my arms are on the cycling bike, and I can't, like, doing a glance at it doesn't
[45:30.060 --> 45:34.940]  turn the screen on, I basically kept the screen on for most of the time, I guess I was most
[45:34.940 --> 45:41.980]  of the time either tapping it or it was just staying on because it knew it was doing something.
[45:41.980 --> 45:46.220]  But yeah, because I like to have I liked having an eye on it to see sort of the accuracy of
[45:46.220 --> 45:51.380]  it six, but yeah, six.
[45:51.380 --> 45:53.960]  Here's my battery life.
[45:53.960 --> 45:59.060]  From the first few days Tuesday didn't apply because that was when I swapped I had to swap
[45:59.060 --> 46:03.220]  the first one they gave me out with the second one because the taptic engine wasn't working.
[46:03.220 --> 46:07.740]  So that doesn't count because I finished I finished the day with like 70% but I'd gotten
[46:07.740 --> 46:14.260]  a new watch at like three o'clock Wednesday 42 Thursday five, but I was up until four
[46:14.260 --> 46:15.260]  in the morning.
[46:15.260 --> 46:19.060]  And that was a day that I had really, really like just spent the whole day playing with
[46:19.060 --> 46:20.060]  the watch.
[46:20.060 --> 46:23.900]  And I never put it into power reserve mode.
[46:23.900 --> 46:26.620]  I don't I don't know if you can set it to do it automatically or not.
[46:26.620 --> 46:33.040]  But the way it's by default is when it gets to 10% it gives you a tap and a scary warning
[46:33.040 --> 46:36.460]  and it says you're down you know your batteries almost out do you want to go to power reserve
[46:36.460 --> 46:37.460]  mode?
[46:37.460 --> 46:38.460]  And I said no.
[46:38.460 --> 46:40.860]  And it still only got to five when I went to sleep.
[46:40.860 --> 46:50.780]  Friday it was over 50% Saturday 37% Sunday, which was Easter, which I I spent with family,
[46:50.780 --> 46:51.780]  but I used it a lot.
[46:51.780 --> 46:52.780]  I was testing it.
[46:52.780 --> 46:53.780]  So it's down to 27%.
[46:53.780 --> 46:58.140]  Oh, I think I used it for driving directions on Sunday too.
[46:58.140 --> 47:01.500]  All of that brightness that you keep it at I haven't changed the brightness.
[47:01.500 --> 47:02.500]  So it's at the default.
[47:02.500 --> 47:03.500]  It's in the middle.
[47:03.500 --> 47:04.500]  Right.
[47:04.500 --> 47:05.500]  Yeah.
[47:05.500 --> 47:08.420]  Yeah, I mean, now here's the big difference.
[47:08.420 --> 47:12.100]  You have a 38 millimeter one and I have a 42.
[47:12.100 --> 47:16.900]  And Apple on their website even says that they they're listed battery life is for the
[47:16.900 --> 47:17.900]  38.
[47:17.900 --> 47:22.580]  And then they say in small print at the bottom of the page, that the 42 gets longer battery
[47:22.580 --> 47:23.740]  life.
[47:23.740 --> 47:24.740]  For the obvious reason.
[47:24.740 --> 47:27.140]  That's really I had not even heard that before.
[47:27.140 --> 47:28.140]  That's crazy.
[47:28.140 --> 47:29.140]  Yeah.
[47:29.140 --> 47:33.580]  That's for crazy because I don't you know, Jeff Fowler who also reviewed it for the journal.
[47:33.580 --> 47:38.780]  I think he also said the same, you know, last through the day.
[47:38.780 --> 47:44.060]  But yeah, for most days for me that that week of testing, I was down for the count around
[47:44.060 --> 47:46.900]  11 by bedtime 1130.
[47:46.900 --> 47:53.260]  And then the days that I had done some working out it had died much earlier.
[47:53.260 --> 47:56.740]  And you know, again, that like during that workout period, which for me usually is a
[47:56.740 --> 48:03.300]  45 minute spin class, which is looking at the heart rate all the time.
[48:03.300 --> 48:05.220]  And I had the screen mostly on.
[48:05.220 --> 48:11.380]  So if you go to Apple Watch his website and go to technology, then it says, so we gave
[48:11.380 --> 48:14.780]  it a battery that lasts up to 18 hours and then there's a footnote.
[48:14.780 --> 48:19.540]  So here's the footnote testing conducted by Apple in March 2015 using pre production
[48:19.540 --> 48:24.380]  Apple Watch and software paired with an iPhone using pre production software.
[48:24.380 --> 48:32.600]  I think what they mean is it was using iOS 8.3 the phone, battery life varies by use
[48:32.600 --> 48:36.820]  and configuration actual results will vary.
[48:36.820 --> 48:39.140]  Actually they don't say anything about the 42 here.
[48:39.140 --> 48:40.980]  I read that somewhere.
[48:40.980 --> 48:43.700]  Somewhere I read that the 42 gets longer battery life.
[48:43.700 --> 48:49.100]  And it makes sense, I think because I think the battery is bigger compared to the 38 then
[48:49.100 --> 48:53.180]  the screen is bigger in terms of needing more energy to light up the screen.
[48:53.180 --> 48:54.180]  Right.
[48:54.180 --> 48:55.180]  Yeah.
[48:55.180 --> 48:58.980]  I mean, even though even on their site, they say, you know, 6.5 hours for workout.
[48:58.980 --> 48:59.980]  Yeah.
[48:59.980 --> 49:04.860]  I mean, it's not abnormal that if you work out more, it's tapping all those sensors,
[49:04.860 --> 49:08.740]  it's gonna it's gonna take a hit.
[49:08.740 --> 49:13.100]  But in short, I found that concerned pre release concerns that the thing wasn't going to get
[49:13.100 --> 49:15.940]  through the day was not an issue.
[49:15.940 --> 49:18.900]  Yeah, same here.
[49:18.900 --> 49:22.340]  But on the other hand, a lot of people have been asking me, does your phone have worse
[49:22.340 --> 49:24.300]  battery life?
[49:24.300 --> 49:27.260]  And I think I didn't do any kind of testing on that.
[49:27.260 --> 49:34.180]  And I was also I've been playing with periscope so much and periscope is a battery killer.
[49:34.180 --> 49:39.900]  I anecdotally, though, I kind of feel like my iPhone has been getting worse battery life.
[49:39.900 --> 49:43.580]  But I'm still getting through the day without charging.
[49:43.580 --> 49:45.500]  See I never really get through the day without charging.
[49:45.500 --> 49:46.860]  I talk on the phone a lot.
[49:46.860 --> 49:49.520]  So I'm not a good person to ask you.
[49:49.520 --> 49:52.420]  Are you in Manhattan most weekdays?
[49:52.420 --> 49:53.420]  Yeah, so there you go.
[49:53.420 --> 49:57.580]  I mean, and I've been in New York a couple times the last couple weeks and that last
[49:57.580 --> 50:03.620]  week or two because I was in New York to get the phone.
[50:03.620 --> 50:05.500]  I mean, to get the watch itself.
[50:05.500 --> 50:09.820]  And then I was there over the weekend to see a Yankees game.
[50:09.820 --> 50:14.980]  So I've been in and you know, you Manhattan is notoriously bad for your battery on your
[50:14.980 --> 50:18.220]  phone just because you have such a hard time getting a signal and the buildings block it
[50:18.220 --> 50:19.580]  and etc, etc.
[50:19.580 --> 50:20.580]  Right.
[50:20.580 --> 50:23.780]  Oh, and I'm the word like if I'm on a subway, I'm usually like constantly looking for the
[50:23.780 --> 50:24.780]  little magic.
[50:24.780 --> 50:25.780]  Yeah.
[50:25.780 --> 50:26.780]  Okay.
[50:26.780 --> 50:27.780]  Right here.
[50:27.780 --> 50:28.780]  Right here.
[50:28.780 --> 50:29.780]  Right.
[50:29.780 --> 50:30.780]  Yeah, exactly.
[50:30.780 --> 50:36.540]  So yeah, I talk on the phone a lot.
[50:36.540 --> 50:39.460]  That's why I say like, I never make it through the whole day for a charge.
[50:39.460 --> 50:43.140]  Because if I work from home, I'm on the phone all the time.
[50:43.140 --> 50:45.940]  Yeah, not the best task.
[50:45.940 --> 50:46.940]  Yeah.
[50:46.940 --> 50:52.340]  It's but you know, I think if anything, though, that most people can can expect to get through
[50:52.340 --> 50:54.220]  the day with their Apple Watch.
[50:54.220 --> 50:55.820]  Yeah, absolutely.
[50:55.820 --> 50:56.820]  Absolutely.
[50:56.820 --> 51:01.840]  I mean, and especially like, I mean, there's so much you can do to I think, make it go
[51:01.840 --> 51:02.840]  longer.
[51:02.840 --> 51:03.840]  It's actually really good experiment.
[51:03.840 --> 51:09.180]  I should try like how long turning down the brightness turning on a lot off of a couple
[51:09.180 --> 51:11.060]  of notifications.
[51:11.060 --> 51:15.580]  How long you could go with it, I bet you could get into, you know, a second full day, maybe
[51:15.580 --> 51:18.720]  I don't know, it's, you know, but at least it's a day.
[51:18.720 --> 51:24.100]  How annoying do you think it is to have to charge it every night?
[51:24.100 --> 51:25.100]  I thought about this.
[51:25.100 --> 51:31.220]  I mean, the question for me is like, what would I what would it if it was really serving
[51:31.220 --> 51:34.120]  a purpose at night for me?
[51:34.120 --> 51:38.260]  I think that would be like the big annoyance.
[51:38.260 --> 51:43.220]  Like if I really thought, oh, this was great for sleep tracking, or I really loved how
[51:43.220 --> 51:48.100]  it woke me up in the morning with a gentle vibration on my wrist or something like that.
[51:48.100 --> 51:49.400]  But it doesn't do those things.
[51:49.400 --> 51:51.220]  So I don't mind taking it off.
[51:51.220 --> 51:53.980]  I mean, is it annoying to have another charger?
[51:53.980 --> 51:54.980]  Yes.
[51:54.980 --> 51:58.660]  I mean, between this and the MacBook that I was reviewing, it's like enough with the
[51:58.660 --> 51:59.660]  chargers already.
[51:59.660 --> 52:03.420]  But yeah, it's not it's not a huge pain to me.
[52:03.420 --> 52:07.980]  It I feel like I almost cheated because when I when I swapped out my the first one that
[52:07.980 --> 52:11.260]  didn't work for the second one, Apple just said you if you want to keep the other charger,
[52:11.260 --> 52:12.260]  you can keep the charger.
[52:12.260 --> 52:13.880]  That's the classic.
[52:13.880 --> 52:16.700]  So I have to and I just left it in my bag.
[52:16.700 --> 52:18.480]  And I you know, because I was testing it.
[52:18.480 --> 52:19.480]  It's on my mind.
[52:19.480 --> 52:23.980]  But so when I went to New York for the weekend, again, I didn't have to even think about getting
[52:23.980 --> 52:26.320]  it from my bedroom and packing it.
[52:26.320 --> 52:27.320]  Right.
[52:27.320 --> 52:32.220]  But I do think most people would want to I would want to I'd want one that I keep at
[52:32.220 --> 52:38.560]  my bed and I would want one that I keep in my travel bag so that I don't have to remember
[52:38.560 --> 52:41.580]  like I just keep lightning chargers in my travel bag.
[52:41.580 --> 52:46.660]  So I never ever have to worry that when I leave the house for a trip that I've remembered
[52:46.660 --> 52:49.820]  to pack a charger from my phone.
[52:49.820 --> 52:52.660]  And I feel like I don't want the same thing for the watch.
[52:52.660 --> 52:57.420]  And the other thing I've been thinking about is it comes with a little the little square
[52:57.420 --> 53:03.140]  five volt AC adapter that the phone comes with.
[53:03.140 --> 53:07.720]  It seems to charge like a mostly empty watch in about an hour and a half to get a full
[53:07.720 --> 53:08.720]  charge.
[53:08.720 --> 53:11.380]  I haven't really timed it like from a completely dead phone.
[53:11.380 --> 53:12.380]  I did.
[53:12.380 --> 53:13.660]  Let me pull up my notes on that.
[53:13.660 --> 53:15.380]  It took me about two hours.
[53:15.380 --> 53:20.720]  Let me pull up my first day I timed that it was about two hours and that was from completely
[53:20.720 --> 53:22.540]  dead.
[53:22.540 --> 53:27.060]  Basically completely dead like like power reserve.
[53:27.060 --> 53:28.660]  Actually that day was completely dead.
[53:28.660 --> 53:32.540]  Let's see if I can pull up my notes on that.
[53:32.540 --> 53:39.340]  Well the thing that occurred to me though is that you have to have an iPhone if you
[53:39.340 --> 53:40.380]  use Apple Watch.
[53:40.380 --> 53:41.960]  They're very explicit about it.
[53:41.960 --> 53:46.300]  It's it you know who knows years from now what you'll be able to do just with the watch.
[53:46.300 --> 53:50.580]  But for now it is it's not useless.
[53:50.580 --> 53:56.540]  It keeps the time and you can use Apple Pay without the phone being in Bluetooth range.
[53:56.540 --> 54:01.580]  But most of the stuff certainly all the notifications anything that's incoming has to come from
[54:01.580 --> 54:03.940]  an internet connection from your paired iPhone.
[54:03.940 --> 54:07.160]  So if you're going to go somewhere with your watch you have to have your iPhone with you.
[54:07.160 --> 54:11.440]  So I'm kind of I kind of wish that they had shipped it with some kind of charger that
[54:11.440 --> 54:16.620]  had two USB ports so that you would only need one thing stuck in the wall.
[54:16.620 --> 54:23.140]  But you could charge both your phone and your watch because as it stands you're you know
[54:23.140 --> 54:26.620]  most of us it's another device you have to charge every night.
[54:26.620 --> 54:30.740]  I mean most of us know this is the same way I feel about the MacBook charger and here's
[54:30.740 --> 54:35.240]  the thing for me I've and I noticed this I noticed it this weekend again at the hotel
[54:35.240 --> 54:40.380]  we stayed in New York on my side of the bed there was one open AC adapter.
[54:40.380 --> 54:46.860]  And so you know to plug in two things bedside I needed to like unplug their lamp or unplug
[54:46.860 --> 54:53.620]  the hotel's alarm clock or something or set up one of the things to charge you know away
[54:53.620 --> 54:56.860]  from the bed away from bedside.
[54:56.860 --> 55:00.900]  Yeah no this is exactly how I felt about the MacBook chargers like could you just put one
[55:00.900 --> 55:04.980]  more USB port in here like or something.
[55:04.980 --> 55:10.180]  So I'm not walking around because there's no other ports on the computer and obviously
[55:10.180 --> 55:16.460]  I could get the $80 dongle or whatever but if it just had another port on that charging
[55:16.460 --> 55:21.900]  brick for my iPhone or my Apple watch or my iPad or my iMac.
[55:21.900 --> 55:25.360]  Like when you're on a working trip and you have a MacBook it is to me it's a very common
[55:25.360 --> 55:31.500]  move which is just plug in the MacBook then plug other devices into USB ports on the thing
[55:31.500 --> 55:35.300]  and it's you know one thing is in the wall but you're charging multiple devices.
[55:35.300 --> 55:36.660]  I do that all the time.
[55:36.660 --> 55:40.500]  Yeah pass through charging or whatever you want to call it.
[55:40.500 --> 55:47.400]  Yeah right yeah use it as a charging hub I mean yeah yeah I mean I do kind of wish that
[55:47.400 --> 55:55.700]  little metal piece on the thing that looks like a heart rate monitor the charging thing
[55:55.700 --> 55:58.460]  you know that thing falls off my nightstand a lot.
[55:58.460 --> 56:02.820]  Eli Patel mentioned in his review he wished he had a they had a stand I agree with that
[56:02.820 --> 56:07.580]  wish there was some better way to prop up the watch on the nightstand.
[56:07.580 --> 56:14.460]  Yeah I yeah I agree I know it just keeps falling for me like I keep every you know even if
[56:14.460 --> 56:18.200]  I string it around the back I guess that's what I should do but if it just keeps falling
[56:18.200 --> 56:22.140]  off the front and also again like I like you said I've been porting this thing all over
[56:22.140 --> 56:23.140]  the place.
[56:23.140 --> 56:26.940]  All right I found it I will put it in the show notes there is a page it's apple.com
[56:26.940 --> 56:33.640]  slash watch slash battery dot html and that's where they say that the all the testing was
[56:33.640 --> 56:38.900]  conducted on a 38 millimeter and this is directly quote from apple apple watch battery performance
[56:38.900 --> 56:42.960]  claims are based on test results from the 38 millimeter apple watch a 42 millimeter
[56:42.960 --> 56:48.060]  apple watch typically experiences longer battery life so there you have it.
[56:48.060 --> 56:53.220]  You think yeah I mean I guess you know given the surface space that screen is well and
[56:53.220 --> 56:58.560]  I think it's exactly like with the iphone 6 and the 6 plus the 6 plus does have a bigger
[56:58.560 --> 57:04.900]  screen but it also gets better better bigger battery life because there's it it's just
[57:04.900 --> 57:09.860]  it's more important to have a bigger bigger battery is more important than the the detriment
[57:09.860 --> 57:18.300]  of a bigger screen to light up right right yeah so I pulled up my notes here I started
[57:18.300 --> 57:25.620]  charging the watch at 7 33 p.m. and it finished charging at 9 20 p.m. so just under two hours
[57:25.620 --> 57:31.420]  is what I had my my sixth grade science experiment we had to do a science fair experiment sixth
[57:31.420 --> 57:36.980]  grade and mine I did mine on batteries and the theory I wanted to test was okay everybody
[57:36.980 --> 57:42.980]  knows alkaline batteries last longer but are they cost effective does it do you actually
[57:42.980 --> 57:47.220]  is it worth your money to spend for the alkaline or just buy the cheap ones and use more of
[57:47.220 --> 57:53.160]  them and so for to conduct the experiment I put them into like a standard ever ready
[57:53.160 --> 57:58.040]  flashlight you know like the just that same you know it's like that plastic flashlight
[57:58.040 --> 58:04.220]  everybody else and the the problem was they all even the cheap batteries would would run
[58:04.220 --> 58:10.460]  the flashlight for like like 20 some hours and so it kept dying while I wasn't looking
[58:10.460 --> 58:16.220]  at it you know or like while I was sleeping it so my parents started getting really mad
[58:16.220 --> 58:21.460]  because just to get like one set of data to actually notice when the light was burned
[58:21.460 --> 58:26.620]  out it took me like like three or four tries each and I could imagine the same thing like
[58:26.620 --> 58:30.420]  trying to test something like that it's like you have to keep looking at it to make sure
[58:30.420 --> 58:34.380]  if it's fully charged and if you miss it and you have to start all over again it's true
[58:34.380 --> 58:43.580]  I did have notes up till 80% and it was at 80% at 838 also the results of my experiment
[58:43.580 --> 58:51.740]  were that alkaline batteries were worth the money so now I feel like getting it out on
[58:51.740 --> 58:56.840]  the podcast makes all the effort I did 30 years ago we're going to buy those batteries
[58:56.840 --> 59:02.340]  and see if I can put them into my Apple watch let me take another break and it seems like
[59:02.340 --> 59:05.720]  a good time for a break and we can keep going on Apple I want to get to the MacBook too
[59:05.720 --> 59:10.060]  but it's I feel like there's still so much more to cover with Apple watch and it's I'm
[59:10.060 --> 59:14.220]  not going to get another chance to talk to someone else who's had it for a while so but
[59:14.220 --> 59:20.140]  let me thank our next sponsor and our good friends at Harry's Harry's sells exceptional
[59:20.140 --> 59:26.240]  shaving stuff at a fraction of the price they sell razor blades they sell the handles they
[59:26.240 --> 59:32.100]  sell shaving cream they sell shaving gel anything you need for your shaving needs Harry's has
[59:32.100 --> 59:36.460]  it at Harry's calm and here's the deal they just looked at it they looked at this scenario
[59:36.460 --> 59:41.220]  the same way that Warby Parker looked at the eyeglasses thing where there's like this cartel
[59:41.220 --> 59:47.240]  pricing or why is this stuff so expensive why when you go into a drugstore is a three
[59:47.240 --> 59:52.580]  pack of razor blades $20 or whatever the heck it costs doesn't that just seem like it's
[59:52.580 --> 59:58.020]  way too expensive and they looked at the market and it turns out it was so they started making
[59:58.020 --> 01:00:03.120]  their own blades they actually are so serious about it they bought a razor blade factory
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:08.480]  in Germany I to me it just shows how serious they are about it they're making their own
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:13.220]  blades over in Germany at a factory that's been making razor blades for a long time and
[01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:18.280]  then they ship them to the US and then they ship them right to you that's it there is
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:23.540]  no middleman there's no markup for retail you just go to Harry's calm you sign up and
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:28.080]  they sell you blades that they made themselves and that's the long-term cost because you
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:32.420]  buy the handle from them and that's just one time and they last their handles are so nice
[01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:36.440]  they're built to last they're not hoping that they break and have to buy another one they're
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:40.380]  selling you a handle that's gonna last for a long time and then all you have to do is
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:45.040]  just keep buying buying the blades you don't have to sign up for it at first you can just
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:49.960]  sign up for a kit just to get a starter thing just to see if it's really as good as I'm
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:55.200]  telling you that it is but then afterwards if you're convinced you can sign up for a
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:59.760]  plan you figure out how often you go through blades you can sign up for a plan and then
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:04.080]  the blades just show up on a regular schedule you tell them how often you go through blades
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:08.880]  and then they just show up when you need them and you never have to worry about it really
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:13.220]  really good stuff if you haven't tried it yet I implore you to you almost you almost

[01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:05.080]  is great it's just like I'm just gonna come on to this podcast every time I gotta buy
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:11.380]  gifts I've or listen I guess I could listen we haven't even talked about the software
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:16.600]  on the watch and I feel and I've I've barely wrote about I saw I like this I have a couple
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:23.620]  more thousand words still in draft I'm working on it's coming out soon I it's there's so
[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:30.580]  much it is such an ambitious 1.0 product and I feel like it's not even there are things
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:35.060]  to complain about and there are things to praise it's you know it and some of the things
[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:41.060]  to complain about are clearly just 1.0 issues some of them I think are maybe deeper design
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:47.300]  questions but it's just so expansive it is really really it's it's the hardest product
[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:54.980]  review I've ever written without question I agree with you and we we had the the ability
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:03:01.340]  of the pleasure of having two reviewers which was a good way to break it up but still there's
[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:08.380]  so much that could be written about this thing yeah you guys had to and recode had to but
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:14.700]  yeah it definitely I think helped to get comprehensive coverage from one publication cuz I really
[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:21.300]  felt like I there's just no way I could cover it all in a week so let's just start here's
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:25.740]  one of the complaints from your review I'm gonna well I don't know here's what I say
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:29.500]  it's just a line that I noted you wrote I love that you can customize the colors and
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:34.060]  details of the watch faces though I do wish you could personalize it more with photos
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:42.060]  or backgrounds and I have felt the same way like I've felt like this it seems like it's
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:47.220]  it's in contradiction where at one point I've I felt like I can't believe how much fun I'm
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:51.660]  having just playing with the watch faces and getting them set up just the way I want and
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:55.660]  then like an hour later I would think boy I wish I could really custom I wish I could
[01:03:55.660 --> 01:04:02.400]  customize this more yeah I know and it's like I kind of kept thinking I was like do I want
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:07.140]  to have a photo of you know I don't have a child now I have a puppy so maybe this is
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:12.100]  a good example would I want to have that on my watch like it's now my home screen on my
[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:18.380]  phone but is that something I would want to have on my wrist all day and I sort of coded
[01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:24.860]  yeah like or at least to have the deeper background ability right like I love play I even on my
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:29.500]  phone I frequently change my background on my phone either on the lock screen or on the
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:35.700]  home screen why can't I do that here I think it's a little I've been thinking about it
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:44.780]  a lot and I feel like they I don't think they're going to give it to us I don't think they're
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:50.060]  going to let us customize it more I think they might add more built-in watch races but
[01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:56.460]  I don't think there's going to be a third-party ability like and certainly the current third
[01:04:56.460 --> 01:05:02.500]  party I don't know if there would be a third party but I think I could see down the line
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:07.220]  them giving the ability for us to change something from our camera roll I mean the photos app
[01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:12.740]  is right there and then it's right in here like a Ken Burns effect right right right
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:18.380]  right do a little at seven do a little Ken Burns effect I've thought of this is a really
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:24.220]  important one iTunes it's an iTunes alert it's really important new new artists on iTunes
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:28.140]  alright let's hold that thought because I do want to I want to bring up this whole too
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:31.660]  many notifications issue let's let's get to that next but let's talk keep talking about
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:36.540]  watch faces I don't know I feel like but I feel like they're not going to do third-party
[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:42.640]  watch faces because I feel like they they want all of the watch faces to still be within
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:48.940]  what they consider the Apple watch brand and it makes me wonder about something like the
[01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:56.700]  idea of pick one of your favorite photos and let that be the background is right there
[01:05:56.700 --> 01:06:00.940]  on the line because then obviously they're not going to have control over the photo but
[01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:05.740]  they would still have complete control over the typography and placement of what's on
[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:10.660]  top of it the time the date whatever the style right like where where it goes but what what
[01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:15.420]  if what like here's a night this is I'm like now I want to design the watch face so my
[01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:21.140]  favorite one is the modular one well that's what I wear most days during the week and
[01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:25.180]  then you know I'd like to change it around but yeah I like to keep playing with the design
[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:31.700]  of the modular one and so what if you could put your photo in like a corner or something
[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:37.500]  you know just be like a right avatar yeah or like it was just a clean design where you
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:43.660]  had the the time and then like you know above or below sort of like Instagram's new layout
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:48.980]  app right where you could sort of split the screen a little bit or have it in a corner
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:52.300]  or something I think they could design it really well is what I'm saying I think but
[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:57.540]  but still within like the constraint of a structure that they've defined yeah I could
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:04.260]  see that fine I mean my guess is exactly what you're saying Johnny I didn't want his very
[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:12.380]  very cleanly perfectly designed watch faces to be tarnished by a photo of I don't know
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:18.140]  someone's ugly uncle or something I or you know or mostly just that they didn't want
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:22.420]  us to to be playing around with it too much I think they do want you playing around with
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:27.260]  it but it's within these constraints of what they've defined as each of these watch faces
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:33.620]  now there's another angle here which is technical which is that the watch clearly the display
[01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:37.200]  is the biggest battery killer in the watch and they're very aggressive about having it
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:41.540]  turn on and off as aggressively as possible that it's off most of the time you tilt your
[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:46.820]  wrist I just did it as I said it and it was perfect it was actually it turned on exactly
[01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:51.580]  as I looked at it could not have turned on at a just did it again so right however I'm
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:56.740]  sitting right now is perfect posture for using Apple watch but then it goes off in six seconds
[01:07:56.740 --> 01:08:01.500]  if you haven't tapped it and they're very aggressive with it and it's an OLED screen
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:06.960]  the first Apple device with an OLED screen and OLEDs you know reason for being I think
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:13.020]  is that it gets really deep blacks and the blacks don't require power it only requires
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:19.660]  power to light up pixels in a non black color and the watch overall is dominated by black
[01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:26.460]  backgrounds and part of it is an aesthetic idea because it really does make the display
[01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:32.900]  blend in to the entire sapphire or on the sport watch glass you know thing it in its
[01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:37.500]  on in most lighting it's it's beautiful in bright daylight you can definitely see where
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:43.780]  the display is so it's aesthetic but it's also technical where these black backgrounds
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:48.860]  absolutely increase the battery life and if you have a photo in the background it would
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:54.380]  have some kind of detrimental effect on that because that's a really interesting even the
[01:08:54.380 --> 01:09:04.540]  fancy butterflies and jellyfish yeah the background it's still a lot of black and they kind of
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:09.820]  fade in yeah so I can't help but think that that might be one of the reasons they don't
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:15.340]  have that that to me seems like an obvious watch face how much black the most colorful
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:20.540]  one is Mickey yeah I would definitely say so the other one that can be colorful I don't
[01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:25.700]  know if you played with this but if you go to the chronograph watch face and you customize
[01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:35.300]  the dial you can change the dial to be like a light cream fight color so go to chronograph
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:41.860]  go to color and then go over to the third no not third it's the middle one where it
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:48.200]  says color and if you go down there's there's two light ones there's a white background
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:54.060]  and then there's like a cream creamy like I don't know what you call it which is the
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:10:01.380]  most lit up I think that's the most lit up you can make the display it's probably close
[01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:06.580]  with Mickey but the other thing is I don't think they look good I think the chronograph
[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:12.460]  looks better when it has a dark background yeah Mickey might be the most this banana
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:18.060]  pudding colors ugly yeah I don't I think that they're trying to mimic I think it's the
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:21.580]  closest they've gotten to skeuomorphism where I feel like they're trying to make that creamy
[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:27.040]  one look like an aged dial from an analog watch like a lot of old you know people who
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:32.640]  collect analog watches the older ones things that used to be white turn to a sort of creamy
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:39.100]  they call it a patina and it's a really pleasing effect you know aesthetically but it's it
[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:46.220]  I don't know somehow it falls flat on a light up screen I think but I think that that one
[01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:49.480]  of the things and I know it's another one of the three things that Apple says the thing
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:54.180]  is it is a great timepiece or whatever I think people are going to have a blast I had a lot
[01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:58.860]  of fun I know it sounds stupid I had a lot of fun I still have fun dicking around dicking
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:08.020]  around with what I've got showing on the watch here's an example so I got the watch and it's
[01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:12.780]  funny because I met with Apple while the old conference in Ireland was going on to get
[01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:16.460]  the review unit and I was supposed to be there speaking and I couldn't because I can't fly
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:24.140]  with this gas bubble in my eye but I was scheduled to do a remote appearance with this oh I'm
[01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:30.440]  gonna forget the name of it but I'm sure you've seen it it's this it's like a Segway little
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:35.020]  Segway type thing that you mount an iPad on and then you can control it's like a remote
[01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:42.940]  telepresence robot I have oh yeah yeah yeah right like the ones they have in all commercials
[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:47.260]  we don't have one in our office but I've seen it in other offices it sounds silly but it
[01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:53.220]  was actually kind of fun and I got to like drive it around the room at at all and I came
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:59.360]  out on stage and said a few words to the crowd and accidentally it's called what's called
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:11.500]  double robotics yes double robotics but anyway I had a scheduled appearance over remotely
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:16.040]  in Ireland and I was awesome I thought it was so great that I could put on my watch
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:23.300]  face the time in that time zone just up in the corner and so it like totally alleviated
[01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:29.300]  my anxiety that I was going to botch it and to further confuse it it was daylight savings
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:34.420]  time weekend in the United Kingdom which is different than when when it was here so everything
[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:40.120]  was going to switch on Sunday night or something like that so instead of being like plus four
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:45.300]  they were going to switch to plus five I just put the time up in my corner in Ireland and
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:49.900]  I knew that I wasn't going to be late little thing and then once I was done with that I
[01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:54.700]  had no concern about what time it was in England anymore so I just turned that off and switched
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:13:00.300]  it to my fitness tracking or something yeah no that's why I love that modular display
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:05.340]  because I can fit so much info on there which could be distracting to people but I love
[01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:11.300]  it and I keep changing the top left hand corner to either California time like you mentioned
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:18.100]  or to the sunset time yeah that seems useful I might actually use that now I've been meaning
[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:24.020]  to try that I don't get it sounds corny but I also like change them based on my outfit
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:28.420]  like I know a lot of people thought I was being super sarcastic in that video and I
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:34.940]  guess I kinda was but I do like that the either the butterfly or the flower watch face for
[01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:40.720]  when I go out yeah I could totally see that just because you want less you know like in
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:43.980]  the daytime you've got meetings you've got things you really do want to see your appointment
[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:46.660]  and then if you're just going out at night you can have dinner you really don't need
[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:53.940]  all that crap it and I and a couple days there I was changing the color of the modular font
[01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:58.780]  to the color of the shirt I was wearing felt super corny but it was fun yeah I don't know
[01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:04.440]  it's it's if you can't if you're so technically minded that you can't imagine that it's fun
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:09.260]  to do things like change the second hand on your watch based on your whims then it's you're
[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:12.740]  not going to see the appeal of this device compared to other ones I do I think it was
[01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:20.740]  kind of fun right I like changing second I like the blue second hand I don't know why
[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:26.500]  I will admit I don't really use the you don't use the analog ones see that to me is a big
[01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:33.940]  deal and because I've all I've worn an analog dial watch for so many years now my brain
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:41.780]  naturally understands time only by the hands and so if I look at a digital watch meaning
[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:47.020]  digital like it's showing the digits because I feel like that the word digital watch is
[01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:51.600]  actually confusing it's like it requires a long discretion digression but it's like it
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:57.740]  means two different things one it means an electronic watch that is digital Lee driven
[01:14:57.740 --> 01:15:03.180]  in terms of how it keeps time as opposed to an analog watch which is using gears and purely
[01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:09.700]  mechanical nothing electronic but digital watch also can mean a watch that is showing
[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:17.100]  the time through numeric digits as opposed through analog hands and to me there's nothing
[01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:25.300]  at all false in terms of like this whole movement away from skeuomorphism about having a digital
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:32.300]  watch in terms of its being electronic using an analog dial in terms of showing time with
[01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:37.380]  the hands it's just a different way of displaying the information and when you have these analog
[01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:42.440]  hands on the Apple watch they don't have any drop shadows or 3d effects or anything like
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:48.180]  that it's very very flat and I think very natural but that to me is how I tell time
[01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:53.140]  like I and it's also why like in my review where I mentioned that when I'm at my keyboard
[01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:57.820]  I'll often glance at my wrist to see the time and everybody's like what you know and I even
[01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:01.940]  said yes I know the time is up in the corner of my Mac but it just doesn't make sense to
[01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:09.860]  me in in like just without having to even think about it way that it does when I glance
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:14.940]  at my wrist and that's where I think like they've that's one part of the software I
[01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:18.660]  think they have done such a good job at it because you're talking about these things
[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:24.660]  that work so well for you personally which I could care less about I mean I care about
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:30.940]  you but I don't I don't care about them for me and I found some layouts that just works
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:37.820]  so well for me and I've also worn an analog watch for a long time but with this like it
[01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:45.260]  just it helps me so much to see my calendar appointments and like for me that that's been
[01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:50.580]  like I can just glance down and I don't I'm yes I same sort of thing yes I get the pop-up
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:56.020]  notification from Outlook or whatever on my phone but I sort of I'm able to budget my
[01:16:56.020 --> 01:17:02.140]  time better knowing okay I have two more hours till I have this puppy training class or what
[01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:09.300]  yeah and I can even see I I think it shows that people at Apple especially the people
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:14.020]  you know on the creative team behind it have a very meeting driven culture where there's
[01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:17.640]  you know they're in a big company they're working at the same time and they have these
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:23.460]  things like you know design meetings and stuff like that I think it really shows that the
[01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:30.500]  watch can be set up you can configure in a way that's really really conducive to that
[01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:34.700]  and I can also see why I'll bet you're right I don't think it's a coincidence that the
[01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:42.700]  modular face is the second one I think that for somebody who has a very frequently has
[01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:46.260]  meetings and has a sketch you know a lot of events on their calendar that that modular
[01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:51.020]  one is really going to be popular and I can also see why then you would want the time
[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:57.740]  in in a digital form because then you see the numbers of the current time and you see
[01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:03.500]  the numbers of the meeting that's coming up and you know hey it's already 1048 and I've
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:08.620]  got an 1130 so anything I want to do it's got it you know I mean I'm looking at mine
[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:12.780]  right now and there's so many numbers I mean I'm and I hate numbers it's really funny that
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:18.220]  I like this one so much but like I've got the time I've got my next appointment I've
[01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:27.060]  got the the the temperature outside I've got the battery life icon 76 right now the sun
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:34.500]  sets at 732 and I love all that information I didn't even notice you could change the
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:43.180]  color on that one yeah so I I changed it today to purple because I was wearing a purple shirt
[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:49.060]  small things you know small things but yeah I mean and as I said in my review like those
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:53.580]  are the two big things both telling time and keeping me on schedule and as a fitness tracker
[01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:58.180]  or fitness device where this thing is really started to play big in my life though over
[01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:02.740]  the last week and maybe my piece next week might be on this is sort of about that notification
[01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:06.460]  thing and how I found a good balance and in many ways despite the fact that it's gone
[01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:11.040]  off like eight times on this podcast let's talk about that next but I have I mean knock
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:16.220]  another sponsor out here and it's our good friends at back blaze now they are a longtime
[01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:19.820]  sponsor of the show they've been they've been gone for a while but now they're back they
[01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:26.980]  offer unlimited unthrottled uncomplicated backup for your mac all of your max for just
[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:31.460]  five dollars a month per mac here's what the deal here's what you do it it sounds too good
[01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:38.900]  to be true but I swear it works I've used it you just go to backblaze.com you can add
[01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:43.580]  slash daring fireball so that you know they know you came from here backblaze.com slash
[01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:48.840]  during fireball you go there you download their mac software you open the mac software
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:54.780]  and you install it it's good software really that the their engineers are former apple
[01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:59.340]  employees they know mac os 10 they know os 10 it's not like some kind of thing that was
[01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:03.220]  written by people who are you know windows programmers and then they did a mac version
[01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:08.540]  it's good mac software then you you get to it through system preferences there's a system
[01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:13.780]  preference panel that you can figure everything through it just runs in the background and
[01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:21.020]  it backs up everything on your mac to their cloud based servers takes a while for the
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:27.740]  first one depending on your upstream bandwidth but just let it run let it run and eventually
[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:31.480]  it's there and then after they have all of your data everything is just incremental after
[01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:36.460]  that you can try for a month for free just about anybody with a modern internet connection
[01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:39.980]  is going to get everything uploaded within days and here's the thing there is no limit
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:43.820]  you might say well yeah there's no limit but there's an asterisk because i have a four
[01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:49.060]  terabyte collection of photographs doesn't matter how big your stuff is anything connected
[01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:54.900]  to your mac all of it goes up into your backblaze account for five bucks a month and there's
[01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:59.060]  no tearing anything like that you just pay five dollars per month for your mac and whatever
[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:05.420]  your data size is it all just goes there the only catch if you can call it catch is if
[01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:09.980]  you have to max then you have to pay for each one five bucks five bucks for each one and
[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:17.080]  then everything is backed up and they have apps for ios so you can do things like while
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:22.020]  you're on your phone and you need to get some file you can just go to the backblaze app
[01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:26.240]  and all of your stuff is already there you can go get that file and do you know should
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:32.140]  use the sharing sheet from the iphone and send it by text message or email or whatever
[01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:35.200]  so you don't even have to have your mac with you to access those files it's a great way
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:41.180]  to access your files from anywhere what do you do when disaster strikes you know your
[01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:47.620]  hard drive freezes up gone kaput or your god forbid your macbook gets stolen or water damaged
[01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:52.100]  or something like that you can go there you can download everything if you want it'll
[01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:55.500]  take a while but you can do something you could just buy a hard drive they'll sell you
[01:21:55.500 --> 01:22:02.180]  a usb hard drive at cost they'll just load all your data onto it and you know pay for
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:06.220]  overnight shipping and the next day you get a usb hard drive that has all of your stuff
[01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:15.420]  on it really great service it works great and it the peace of mind of this is just phenomenal
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:18.740]  joanna mentioned earlier mother's day is coming up how about this don't even you have to get
[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:22.420]  her a real gift so get her the fracture too you can't just say hey your mother's day gift
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:26.480]  is i'm backing up your mac but just do it for it don't even tell her just go sign her
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:31.420]  up for backblaze pay the five dollars a month for and then you know that your mom's mac
[01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:35.520]  is backed up and nothing she does to it nothing that can happen she's going to lose anything
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:41.020]  from it really can't thank them enough go to backblaze.com slash during fireball and
[01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:47.660]  sign up can't recommend them highly enough i love that you just told people to get backup
[01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:51.340]  software for their mom yeah but you have but you have to get them something else do not
[01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:55.700]  do not give your mom backup software and tell her that john gruber told her that was a good
[01:22:55.700 --> 01:23:00.980]  gift you gotta get it you just told everyone to get their mom backup software gotta get
[01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:07.860]  her flowers or a fracture or something too all of you listening who get your mom just
[01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:11.980]  backup software you are terrible children all right i want to talk about notifications
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:17.420]  on this thing because i thought that if there's one thing that i saw across the reviews that
[01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:23.600]  to me i didn't get were complaints from reviewers saying well my risk just keeps pinging pinging
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:28.740]  pinging and it can be annoying because they i think it's really easy to filter it and
[01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:35.020]  to say i i kind of i one of the things that takes you getting used to is learning what
[01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:39.460]  you have to do from the apple watch app on your phone and what you can configure on the
[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:44.820]  watch alone it is a little it takes some getting used to i don't think it's a complaint i can
[01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:50.380]  see why you can't that why they don't put everything on the watch but one of the things
[01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:54.140]  that you do from the phone from the apple watch app on the phone as you go to the apple
[01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:59.380]  watch app you go to notifications and then it just lists all of the apps on your phone
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:03.860]  that have notifications turned on and when and then you can turn off on an app by app
[01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:08.140]  basis whether they go to your watch and so every time i got something on my watch that
[01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:12.080]  annoyed me i would just go to my phone go to that app turn it off and say i don't want
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:16.580]  that anymore no more periscope notifications on my watch that was the first thing i was
[01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:23.180]  like the first thing i did like after i parted ways with apple and i had the review i think
[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:28.740]  it took about two minutes for me to just say all right periscope you're gone i had a bunch
[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:35.260]  of things like that i'm looking through my list now i found anything that didn't let
[01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:42.500]  me respond i wanted off so for example tweetbot direct messages i love you know direct messages
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:47.140]  are very close to text so i want notifications for them it's in fact the only thing i get
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:51.780]  notifications from twitter related just because i know a lot of people have like replies and
[01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:55.860]  mentions and stuff like that but i you know it people like yeah i don't we have too many
[01:24:55.860 --> 01:25:01.620]  you know where it's just in a weird you know the way that we're weird micro celebrities
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:06.920]  you know yeah it's just it sounds stupid but i know i get i don't know two or three hundred
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:11.820]  replies a day i cannot possibly or i could but i mean it would drive me insane if i got
[01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:17.100]  notifications for them but i thought dms on my watch were annoying too because i couldn't
[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:23.480]  do anything with them it it's it and you can't really do anything with email either we can
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:29.100]  get to that i find the inclusion of email on apple watch to be bizarre and it seems
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:34.060]  like something it seems like a one of the best apps that they wrote it works incredibly
[01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:40.620]  well and i feel like somebody really knocked it out of the park building it but i don't
[01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:46.020]  understand why like me and why it's there because you can't reply there is no way to
[01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:55.540]  reply to an email i guess i can understand i you know i i say that yeah i'm being a little
[01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:59.580]  bit hyperbolic because i understand that sometimes if you get a really important email you might
[01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:03.020]  want to see it right there on the watch and then you have to do something but the fact
[01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:09.780]  that you then have to do something on the phone i don't know there's a certain it crosses
[01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:15.620]  a line that to me it's it's why i never liked wearing my original pebble put aside the size
[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:19.080]  of the pebble and the screen and whatever the thing that always got me with the original
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:22.620]  pebble was i could never respond i always had to go back to the phone and every once
[01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:27.440]  in a while i'd get you know as i tried it i'd say like well i'm glad i saw that on my
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:32.180]  wrist but now i have to go to my phone to reply like i reply to text messages using
[01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:39.500]  the watch frequently it's you do voice or with sometimes some you know the auto buttons
[01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:43.860]  are actually pretty good in some cases yeah they're pretty good uh right you know and
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:49.480]  you can set those yeah but the voice works pretty well for me and again that is going
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:56.140]  to vary by your you know your current cellular collection connection but i wrote weeks ago
[01:26:56.140 --> 01:27:02.860]  that i have found siri to be getting a lot better at dictation at the very least in terms
[01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:08.740]  of you know just when you talk to siri whether it's on the watch or on the phone the transcription
[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:13.380]  happens faster it seems to be happening a lot more accurately and it's really pretty
[01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:16.740]  good and it's a little frustrating from the way here's the biggest frustration on a watch
[01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:23.740]  is there's no text editing so if it gets it almost right if i dictate a sentence-long
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:29.700]  response via the watch but it has one serism whatever you want to call the typos that siri
[01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:34.980]  gives you right you have to decide whether you scrap the whole thing and start over or
[01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:42.200]  just let it fly and hope that your correspondent sympathizes and understands right yeah i found
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:48.020]  it um one thing i did find siri really helpful with and i know you can't respond to emails
[01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:54.340]  but it is helpful like if i get an email that says a company can meet at 2 p.m i have siri
[01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:59.180]  make that i've i've done this had siri make that appointment on my email on my calendar
[01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:04.220]  through the watch um i yeah i guess like it would really be nice to be able to respond
[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:09.580]  to those people and say yes i can make that meeting i understand why they don't let you
[01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:15.700]  respond and they do for texts because texts tend to be one sentence at a time and even
[01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:21.780]  though right or a word yeah and even though you might send to some emails yes two o'clock
[01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:28.880]  is fine or you know absolutely or something like that um a lot of times you don't there's
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:33.340]  a lot of emails that required even just a few sentences and once you get to a few sentences
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:37.540]  the odds of the dictation being perfect are very low and the fact that you can't text
[01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:43.060]  at it you know i'd use the dictation on my phone tons too especially on the east coast
[01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:47.920]  in winter where my hands are cold and i might be outside uh and again that's what made me
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:51.660]  write the thing a couple of weeks ago about how i've noticed that it's getting better
[01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:58.060]  but the thing with the phone is if there's one stupid mistake in the what siri transcribed
[01:28:58.060 --> 01:29:04.260]  you can double click that word hit the microphone button again and replace that one word by
[01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:08.140]  you know enunciating much more you know as clearly as you can what that word was you
[01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:19.500]  can't do that with the watch uh and it's like the one downside to that yeah i mean yeah
[01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:25.220]  i've just in terms of email i have a lot more frustrations that go way beyond the reply
[01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:31.660]  stuff um but again i think that's mostly my frustrations with some of the notification
[01:29:31.660 --> 01:29:44.220]  customization features or lack thereof uh yeah i mean one thing and i and i've set up
[01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:50.420]  vip but to me vip doesn't go far enough right and it this is some of the intelligence that
[01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:57.240]  i think apple stands to learn a lot from google and where i do feel like the missing presence
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:04.180]  of google on this device is in gmail for instance i mean yes i do get the the notifications
[01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:10.400]  that hit in like i use inbox i do get those notifications on my wrist um and those those
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:14.940]  are usually really helpful usually inbox is really good at knowing when i like emails
[01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:20.040]  or when i don't like emails um you know surfacing ones from friends and family putting the other
[01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:24.880]  ones in their other filters um i don't know john if you use it but um i find it really
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:33.480]  helpful and then in mail it's just there's so many other emails beyond vip those people
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:38.520]  that i've designated as vips that i want um coming to my wrist and it's just you don't
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:46.820]  have that level of granularity you can't specific you know mail doesn't know well enough which
[01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:53.100]  people i'd like to respond to which emails are important to me yeah i think steven leavy
[01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:59.760]  had a piece just yesterday where at his back channel thing at medium where he talked about
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:07.880]  like that we need like the next level for ai to go is notification filtering it's yeah
[01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:13.840]  it is it's too it's too hard to do by rules and i think back to spam filtering i remember
[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:21.720]  when spam first became a problem with email you know like in the late 90s and the way
[01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:26.000]  i dealt with it in a way most people i knew dealt with it is we had a bunch of filters
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:31.640]  rules we you know you just set up your mail client with a bunch of rules and there was
[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:37.280]  you know uh i don't know little things like i still do that like if you're on corporate
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:40.560]  mailing lists you still have to do that you do definitely but for the most part though
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:44.720]  most spam is already you know there's no way that you could have without something like
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:52.200]  you know uh a system level above you not your rules you'd be inundated and because they
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:57.640]  just there's it's whack-a-mole um i remember there but there were like uh you know six
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:01.820]  or seven rules you could use and then boom you could cut your spam by like 90 and it's
[01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:06.880]  just not enough anymore and i kind of feel like notifications are that way where you
[01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:11.600]  can right now it's like we're at that era where we're setting up our own filters like
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:17.720]  you're saying uh okay i don't want all my email that's crazy but i do want the people
[01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:22.260]  on this vip list okay there you go and it's i i see i know what you mean though because
[01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:25.900]  it's there's always going to be an important email that isn't from someone who's already
[01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:29.740]  on your vip list and then you're going to you want that and it seems as though there
[01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:35.340]  ought to be a way for ai to figure that out and it's you know and if anybody's going to
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:40.100]  get that best if anybody's doing it already it's definitely google because that's right
[01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:45.960]  right and it's there we all have yeah for sure and i mean that's that's like for instance
[01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:49.880]  why you keep hearing these pings today because i've been out and about with the with the
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:53.260]  puppy and i wanted to keep my email alerts on because i've been waiting for an email
[01:32:53.260 --> 01:33:00.200]  back from from google actually and um if i turned on my vip thing like i don't have that
[01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:07.440]  specific contact as a vip why would i right but if i don't if i don't like there's no
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:12.240]  way to get the stuff in the middle yeah it's either it's giving me the lowest hanging stuff
[01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:18.660]  which is like emails from you know general wall street journal editors about seo term
[01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:25.520]  words and then i'm getting itunes spam and then i'm getting when that email comes in
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:28.640]  from that person from google and immediately on my wrist when i'm out and about in the
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:34.240]  apartment can i tell you it just kicked in because i had this show on my watch and i
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:38.640]  guess i only had it scheduled for 90 minutes so it's over um one of my least favorite things
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:43.320]  on the watch face is if you have your next event as one of the complications when you're
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:49.640]  done for the day it changes to say no more events and it's like in all capital letters
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:55.480]  and it it it just seems like visual pollution to me no more events it makes me feel like
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:59.320]  i'm i'm doing something wrong that i don't have anything else scheduled today you have
[01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:03.840]  nothing else to do today you can go to bed now i totally agree with the notification
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:09.600]  i want i want my i want this whole thing to just figure out what i what i want on my on
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:15.280]  my wrist right and it could maybe use um maybe if there was like a way to give a thumbs down
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:20.800]  to a notification that gets through you know and and maybe like some kind of way where
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:25.120]  you could give a thumbs down to a notification that gets through that you really didn't want
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:31.180]  and conversely on your phone to give a thumbs up to a notification that was only on your
[01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:35.060]  phone and didn't go to your wrist to say oh this was good i wish that this had gone to
[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:39.040]  my wrist and and then it could it needs a little bit of that feedback for sure and i
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:44.000]  don't think definitely i mean that's how that's how google's learning right i mean they knew
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:49.560]  they know what we favorite right that's part of what what they do and like if i move something
[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:56.680]  from um you know whatever they call it my perm uh now promotions the updates updates
[01:34:56.680 --> 01:35:00.860]  is one of the things that they sometimes don't get right they'll put things that i that are
[01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:05.160]  important to me and updates in that filter and i drag it you know they automatically
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:10.700]  start putting things there uh do you keep the notifications indicator on it's that red
[01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:16.000]  dot at the top i do but i i this is part of this piece i might want to write for next
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:22.200]  week that thing can control your life like i look down and i'm like uh-oh you know it's
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:26.980]  sort of like that it to me it reminds me of the blinking red dot from the blackberry blackberry
[01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:33.180]  age that was exactly what i was going to ask you as a known former recovering it is and
[01:35:33.180 --> 01:35:37.720]  you and it's like i gotta look i got to look like even though it's probably not something
[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:43.160]  i care about at all i need to look now i've never been a blackberry user but i know enough
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:49.300]  that the the idea is that blackberries had a physical red led and it would blink if you
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:54.780]  had new messages and then your blackberry was blinking right you could leave it on your
[01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:57.880]  desk or something and you could walk away and you come back and there's blinking red
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:03.520]  you pick up your blackberry and you see what is it and i remember when in that era when
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:10.420]  blackberry users were switching to android phones and iphones that the thing that it
[01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:13.620]  just kept i kept seeing over and over again is i don't know what to do without that red
[01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:19.280]  light god i i don't even want to tell apple how much more money i would spend for an otherwise
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:24.060]  identical iphone with a blinking red light right now i heard that from so many people
[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:28.760]  and you probably did too because you're a known sympathizer to the blackberry attic
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:35.100]  cause i can see why though now with this watch like i still have it on but i'm thinking by
[01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:39.500]  the way i still think that red light on a on an iphone would save a lot of battery life
[01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:47.060]  i i see the appeal of it to me it's the exact equivalent of the um the ringer switch on
[01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:52.640]  the iphone which most phones don't come with most like android phones don't have a dedicated
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:57.460]  on off ringer switch and i don't know what i would do without that i love my ringer switch
[01:36:57.460 --> 01:37:01.940]  it would drive me and in fact when i do try using phones other than the iphone like i
[01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:08.060]  have the uh the second gen moto x here um honest to god i think my single biggest complaint
[01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:12.180]  about it is that it doesn't have a ringer switch above and beyond all of you know the
[01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:19.500]  things that i would prefer about ios versus uh android and the physical hardware of the
[01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:23.980]  phone etc etc the thing that just drives me nuts is that i can't just silence it without
[01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:27.460]  turning it on and i know that there's a quick way to do it from the top you go down and
[01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:31.960]  it's a couple of taps but i'm just addicted to the way that i can just turn it on and
[01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:37.540]  off without even looking at it uh and to me it i don't i don't in that same way that's
[01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:41.340]  what the blinking red light on the blackberry was it was a way of saying we're just going
[01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:45.060]  to put this on the device we're going to make it a hardware feature not a software feature
[01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:51.100]  that you can tell if there's something new yeah i'm looking at i don't think i really
[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:56.660]  ever use the ring oh my god are you crazy do you leave it on or do you leave it off
[01:37:56.660 --> 01:38:03.820]  i leave it on so you always have sounds coming from your iphone pretty much i would unless
[01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:10.280]  i'm doing like going to something and i use it or just silence it now see i keep it silenced
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:14.600]  because i just otherwise i feel like i'm getting bombarded with sounds all the time i like
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:20.460]  to have it off i mean honestly you know when i really only check it i use this to check
[01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:26.900]  to make sure i'm getting uh like my alarm's gonna go off in the morning well uh see that's
[01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:33.060]  you know i not everybody is addicted to everything right it's like but to me like it's incomprehensible
[01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:37.020]  to me that every phone doesn't come with a switch like this and i it's my as the time
[01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:40.340]  has gone on it's my least favorite thing about the current generation of ipads where they
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:46.020]  got rid of that switch and i know other people use it it was like you could configure it
[01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:50.580]  on the ipads to be either a rotation lock or the sound lock but i kept it yes that's
[01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:58.280]  what i used to use it as i still kept it a sound lock yeah yeah no i love this little
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:02.340]  i mean i hate this little red button but i hate i love it also i i've got to turn it
[01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:06.900]  off i think yeah i i kind of think i'm gonna end up turning it off in the long run and
[01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:11.460]  just you know i'll just check by swiping down to see if there are notifications yeah that
[01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:16.420]  i've you know that are still pending yeah i mean that's like one thing too like does
[01:39:16.420 --> 01:39:22.340]  this i have to clean these all out but does this mimic the notification tray on your phone
[01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:28.380]  it does right uh i think so except the one on your phone can have more because some of
[01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:33.760]  them don't go through yeah i wish there was a way to clear these all your is force touch
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:43.500]  it oh no is this a secret force touch yeah oh my god this is the craziest thing to me
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:51.140]  secret force touch is secret force touch is like a mind-bending thing i've just changed
[01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:57.460]  you find things that are just not you would never have known you would have never thought
[01:39:57.460 --> 01:40:01.320]  to force touch on that menu i never would have thought to force touch on the notification
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:06.220]  menu just like i was on the verge cast last week i would have never thought to force touch
[01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:12.760]  on the emojis to change it you can change like the the pac-man uh smiley guy to a red
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:18.260]  red face pac-man you can change the hearts to purple right you can get a purple heart
[01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:24.540]  on this thing that is my tip i know that it's you know 10 days away 10 two weeks away from
[01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:27.780]  everybody out there getting their apple watches but i'm telling you my number if there's one
[01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:31.540]  thing you remember from this episode of the show when you get your apple watch it's don't
[01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:37.560]  forget to try force tap everywhere you go no force touch everything uh just force touch
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:42.260]  every single thing on on the so force touching notification center or i don't know what they
[01:40:42.260 --> 01:40:46.140]  call it if they call it but would you come this is my chain this is like completely life
[01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:50.740]  changing just clear them come down from the top and force touch and you get one button
[01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:54.200]  clear all and they all go away so let me tell you this i'm so addicted to that that i've
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:58.860]  started doing it on my phone because one of the things and it's a long-standing complaint
[01:40:58.860 --> 01:41:02.820]  a lot of people have is on the iphone you can't you can't clear all of your notifications
[01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:07.420]  you can only do it app by app i hit the x and you have to hit clear again and then you
[01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:12.060]  have to hit the next x then clear so i just i've started force touching my phone thinking
[01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:16.700]  that i can clear all because i clear all on my watch all the time we're pretty sure force
[01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:20.160]  touch is coming to the phone right i mean it seems like yeah but i really here's the
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:25.540]  big we could go on and on about this but here's my my question about it with the phone is
[01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:29.660]  we have two two devices with force touch and and i want to talk to you about the macbook
[01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:34.800]  too and we can get to it there but so we have the new macbook which has the force touch
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:40.100]  trackpad and we have the watch which has force touch on this little tiny screen on the watch
[01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:45.180]  force touch it the whole screen is just effectively a button it doesn't matter where you force
[01:41:45.180 --> 01:41:49.600]  touch it's just a it's either a force tap or not a force tap and that's it a regular
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:54.500]  tap has location like a touch screen if you tap hard it's just a force tap doesn't matter
[01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:59.940]  where so you can't force tap on a thing on the watch and i think that makes sense because
[01:41:59.940 --> 01:42:06.160]  it's so small on the trackpad obviously it's very very precise and you get a you get the
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:11.720]  tactic feedback exactly where your finger is so i think it's definitely coming to the
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:18.460]  iphone i think it's coming to the ipad eventually if not this year it'll be just one more year
[01:42:18.460 --> 01:42:24.680]  but my question is is on these phones and tablets is it going to be like precise or
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:28.880]  is it going to be like the watch where it's like you've just forced tapped and that's
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:33.300]  it and it you know it doesn't matter where your finger is on the screen i think it's
[01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:39.040]  going to be precise depending on the screen size right i think like on the macbook you
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:45.380]  can force touch on a word right and that's very precise so i could see that also being
[01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:53.820]  an option on um on the phone and on the iphone right like if i force touched uh on instead
[01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:58.960]  of uh double tapped on a word i maybe something else would happen let me think i i definitely
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:03.400]  want it to work that way on my iphone i want it to be like precise so i can force tap on
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:07.960]  a word but i'm i just wonder whether i'm setting myself up for disappointment because engineering
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:13.800]  wise like it can't right they can make the trackpad so that the trackpad isn't underneath
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:19.480]  the trackpad is entirely set up as a haptic feedback thing but they there may not be it
[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:25.480]  because the this the phone all there is is a screen effectively that they may not have
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:31.640]  the room to make the whole thing you know precisely taptic i don't know i might be setting
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:35.320]  myself up for disappointment there so i'm not letting myself yeah i guess i now that
[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:40.000]  i think about it too but but yeah it's certainly like i would be very happy to force touch
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:46.180]  on the notifications clear all right you know what i'd be also really happy for apple if
[01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:53.440]  you are listening to this podcast i want to force touch in control center on the wireless
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:59.220]  command the little wireless circle and i want to go to the settings menu and there i want
[01:43:59.220 --> 01:44:06.120]  to be able the the wireless settings menu and i want to be able to get to wi-fi oh okay
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:10.520]  i see that's a request so you go from control center force touch on the look i hate that
[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:14.640]  i can't get to settings from control center i see what you mean where you would just i
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:19.300]  want to just to toggle it on and off but do a do a force touch on it and then jump to
[01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:24.820]  the settings for bluetooth yes that is that is i would i would be very very i would be
[01:44:24.820 --> 01:44:27.980]  so that would make a lot of sense and then you could do it like with all of them because
[01:44:27.980 --> 01:44:32.180]  you need to do it with do not disturb instead of just turning it on or off you would jump
[01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:36.080]  to your do not disturb settings and you could change like the time that it's scheduled for
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:41.200]  right i mean most of the time when i'm turning on and off wi-fi it's true i'm just getting
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:44.800]  on my home network or whatever for some reason i turned off wi-fi i don't know it was slow
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:49.980]  or something someplace and i turned it off but a lot of the time i'm also going to someplace
[01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:56.460]  and i want to get on a new wi-fi network and i just want to get to the wire the wi-fi settings
[01:44:56.460 --> 01:45:01.900]  and it's a whole other step i've got to go into settings and i got to hit wi-fi and yes
[01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:07.360]  i know cry me river it's three taps but two taps but just a request i have two things
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:11.380]  i want to talk about still before we wrap up i want to talk about third-party apps on
[01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:16.340]  the watch and i want to talk about the new macbook do you have anything else that that's
[01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:21.220]  like a must talk about i i think we could easily fill up our remaining time with that
[01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:25.180]  all right before we get started with either let me just thank this puppy's still sleeping
[01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:30.280]  he's been sleeping the whole podcast that's how bored he is of me he's so bored by this
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:36.140]  conversation i i had a boyhood family dog i think i was in second grade when we got
[01:45:36.140 --> 01:45:40.460]  him his name was chester and i loved him as much as i've ever loved any living being on
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:48.760]  this planet just about um and he slept 23 hours a day i think as a puppy and then even
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:54.300]  as an adult he i think he probably slept about 21 hours a day but i was so i was i was pretty
[01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:58.920]  upset because i thought he would be playing with me non-stop all the time i thought so
[01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:03.540]  too i've been home for the like the last i took off for i just don't have a column this
[01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:07.140]  week and i was like oh i'm gonna play with him all day he sleeps all day and i keep i
[01:46:07.140 --> 01:46:10.700]  keep asking my wife i think he's depressed i think he's depressed no we need to take
[01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:15.580]  him someplace no she's like no he's a puppy he just he sleeps all day that's what he's
[01:46:15.580 --> 01:46:20.580]  going to do and i'm like no i i think he's got i think he's upset nope that is why else
[01:46:20.580 --> 01:46:24.780]  that's what they do it's kind of awesome if you think about it they're they're living
[01:46:24.780 --> 01:46:31.040]  the life did you get the week off just to go to go meta for a second did you get the
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:36.500]  week off because you did uh the apple watch review and the macbook review at the same
[01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:42.340]  time which i yes and then i decided to get a puppy like the day after so i barely slept
[01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:48.000]  for for a very long time uh but yes i did i did get the week off for that reason i forget
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:53.340]  how many words long my apple watch review was which didn't really go to the software
[01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:57.920]  and it was still many many thousands of words and when i was done i really felt like i needed
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:05.800]  to check myself into like a spa or something and recuperate and meantime you had i cannot
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:09.140]  believe that you'd reviewed both at the same time people email me and they were like did
[01:47:09.140 --> 01:47:12.380]  you get the macbook you can have a review and i was like no i did not get the macbook
[01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:19.080]  i didn't want the macbook i'm exhausted having reviewed the apple watch you did both i i
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:24.740]  you know that video took so much out of me that apple watch video because i just never
[01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:28.480]  thought it would actually work we were we spent like so much time thinking about it
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:34.140]  and then like just so many hours editing and figuring out if this thing could come together
[01:47:34.140 --> 01:47:38.460]  to a piece that people would actually want to watch that we were there at the i was at
[01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:43.100]  the office two two or three nights in a row till 2 a.m and then i was like oh yeah and
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:47.420]  then this this macbook review i salute you because i don't understand how you did it
[01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:50.740]  all i don't understand how you did the video and i don't understand how you did all three
[01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:54.860]  of the things and the macbook you had a good macbook video too but the apple watch video
[01:47:54.860 --> 01:47:58.760]  for those of you who haven't watched it i'll put it in the show load but joanna's uh apple
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:06.600]  watch video was truly first person she literally put a helmet on that could support a it looked
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:14.460]  like an slr i mean it was it was it was a it's a 70d it's a canon 70d so no crappy go
[01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:19.460]  pro it to an actual i honestly i watched the video first and then at the end there is like
[01:48:19.460 --> 01:48:23.660]  a third person shot that shows you shooting it and i was like at first i thought it was
[01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:28.260]  a joke and then i thought no that explains why the quality was so great the whole thing
[01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:34.020]  is it's a day in the life of using apple watch shot literally from the first person perspective
[01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:39.180]  you know eyeball level uh and the way she did it was by spending a day of her life with
[01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:45.460]  a helmet with with a canon 70d in front of her face yeah it was insane i mean i wanted
[01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:48.760]  to do something different because i was like everyone's going to have video reviews of
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:52.740]  this thing i wanted to do something different and my whole purpose was actually to like
[01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:57.620]  sort of do an anti-apple ad like this is what it's like to use in a real life and not on
[01:48:57.620 --> 01:49:03.380]  like a beautiful white background and yeah it just turned into this massive project and
[01:49:03.380 --> 01:49:08.420]  one of the producers had done something similar and i was like so about this helmet camera
[01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:13.940]  you think it's like you think it's ready to go and we just did it and yeah i thought it
[01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:17.560]  was really worked well and i thought the other thing too here's the other thing though that
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:24.440]  amazes me and and it i think it's because i'm a very slow worker but to me that amazes
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:31.440]  me is that not just that you did this very production and intensive video and and footage
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:34.940]  intensive right because you had to spend a whole day with the with the helmet on so it
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:42.020]  took a long time to get all the footage clearly took a long time to edit and you wrote a completely
[01:49:42.020 --> 01:49:49.740]  credible column reviewing it uh and having used the watch myself and i mean watched the
[01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:55.420]  video and read your review clearly you spent enough time using the watch to form a very
[01:49:55.420 --> 01:50:00.860]  informed opinion so because that to me is part of the problem with these review schedules
[01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:05.540]  is that it takes it takes so much time with the device before you can even start because
[01:50:05.540 --> 01:50:11.100]  you need the time to form a genuine opinion of it and to understand it right i know and
[01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:15.580]  i think people were concerned also about the macbook i had the macbook for two weeks um
[01:50:15.580 --> 01:50:19.900]  i had and i had you know that was a nice thing about both of these pieces i had look we could
[01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:24.540]  have definitely used some more time on the watch in terms of the embargo time but um
[01:50:24.540 --> 01:50:30.540]  i had a week and a half um and really hammered on that and then also used the macbook as
[01:50:30.540 --> 01:50:36.760]  my main laptop through the whole thing so i had a good amount of time for testing um
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:41.140]  you know battery life testing on macbook can take quite a bit of time and so i had i had
[01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:45.100]  a good amount of time for that uh your video included and there's the last thing on the
[01:50:45.100 --> 01:50:54.180]  vi it has a hilarious cameo from rupert murdoch how in the world did you get that all right
[01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:59.620]  yeah i mean obviously some parts of the video were scripted all right okay people have been
[01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:04.260]  like so did you really just run into him no i didn't just run into rupert with a huge
[01:51:04.260 --> 01:51:09.260]  helmet camera on and like was like rupert could you steal my watch um yeah that was
[01:51:09.260 --> 01:51:13.540]  scripted but he was totally game he was great to work with on it he was just like okay sure
[01:51:13.540 --> 01:51:18.180]  sounds like fun he's always struggling as having a great sense of humor yeah he and
[01:51:18.180 --> 01:51:23.580]  he like we didn't i didn't say what to say it was just like we'll try it out and he he
[01:51:23.580 --> 01:51:30.460]  was the one who really ran with it so um i died at that point it was so funny i was like
[01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:35.100]  all right all right yeah you can steal the watch totally i mean i my idea was um honestly
[01:51:35.100 --> 01:51:38.420]  just to run into him in the elevator which actually does happen a lot i you know will
[01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:43.360]  come up from doing a fox news business hit and he'll be in on the same floor and i'll
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:51.580]  say hi uh but he was like oh yeah no sure i'll i'll do this yeah i was i mean also i
[01:51:51.580 --> 01:51:56.060]  kept joking like are you sure you know it's not the apple watch edition is it good enough
[01:51:56.060 --> 01:52:02.760]  for you because rupert muradog is clearly among the people on the planet earth where
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:08.020]  the difference between the edition and the regular apple watch is eh well whichever color
[01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:13.980]  i like better right exactly i thought it was great and i really do think it also kind of
[01:52:13.980 --> 01:52:22.860]  uh it kind of hammers home the the modern the modernization of the wall street journal
[01:52:22.860 --> 01:52:27.220]  culture like it wasn't out of character i think it's completely within the character
[01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:32.340]  of the the style of reviews you guys do now but i don't know having the publisher of the
[01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:38.740]  paper you know the famous publisher the paper show up as a cameo in a review of a tech product
[01:52:38.740 --> 01:52:43.260]  i thought it was great yeah i mean i tried i wanted every scene to have a little bit
[01:52:43.260 --> 01:52:48.580]  of a purpose like obviously my sister saying you know i can't can i curse yeah you can
[01:52:48.580 --> 01:52:53.180]  totally curse yeah you know like fuck you to me like you know i thought that was i thought
[01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:57.140]  it was fun but also showed like a people are going to be really excited about getting this
[01:52:57.140 --> 01:53:00.700]  watch and be like making phone calls on it isn't actually totally stupid everybody should
[01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:05.140]  watch it's funny i'm not going to spoil everyone it's really funny the interpretation of that
[01:53:05.140 --> 01:53:09.580]  because i didn't editorialize so much like so many of my reviews i basically am editorializing
[01:53:09.580 --> 01:53:14.260]  i'll say buy or don't buy or you know this is and in that i didn't really editorialize
[01:53:14.260 --> 01:53:19.020]  so much and so people have had different interpretations of it which is great i've had people email
[01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:23.140]  me and tweet saying i watched it three times and i'm still not sure if you liked it or
[01:53:23.140 --> 01:53:28.820]  you didn't like it um which i i kind of love and i think you know certainly people have
[01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:31.900]  watched it and said i'm definitely not buying one and other people have said oh you made
[01:53:31.900 --> 01:53:36.380]  me want one so badly um you know business insider completely ripped off the article
[01:53:36.380 --> 01:53:40.660]  and said this is the reason you would not want to buy one or ripped off the video and
[01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:45.820]  i just yeah i've had the same thing with my review i have had people i've had responses
[01:53:45.820 --> 01:53:49.820]  both ways i had people said i was really on the fence i was going to wait this out then
[01:53:49.820 --> 01:53:53.640]  i read your review and i thought screw it i'm getting one at three o'clock in the morning
[01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:57.820]  you know the day they go on sale and then i had other people just as many who said i
[01:53:57.820 --> 01:54:02.700]  was totally set to buy one of these and i read your review and uh i'm not i'm not buying
[01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:06.780]  one i'm going to wait i've had both responses and i don't think that's ever happened with
[01:54:06.780 --> 01:54:12.640]  a product before that i can yeah and it wasn't just one or two it was a solid half a dozen
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:18.500]  both ways yeah i mean in the column i was obviously a little more blatant i've told
[01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:22.880]  many friends i don't think they should buy this um and then certainly many people read
[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:26.820]  and i've been getting tons of emails from people saying do you think i should get this
[01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:31.580]  sport version do you think i should get this band you know lots of people read and said
[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:36.820]  yeah you showed me the goods and the bads and i'm i'm deciding on yes or no or whatever
[01:54:36.820 --> 01:54:44.780]  yeah i you know i got the um the steel edition and i'm glad i did but i kind of wish i had
[01:54:44.780 --> 01:54:50.060]  more time with the sport edition but i think i know enough and i've definitely you know
[01:54:50.060 --> 01:54:53.860]  i've seen enough and i trust apple you know and from that what other people have tried
[01:54:53.860 --> 01:54:59.460]  it on and said um and if the fact that i like those sport bands so much that i feel like
[01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:02.980]  anybody who's on the fence but kind of wants one just go ahead and get the sport one at
[01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:09.500]  the entry level price and you're going to get a totally quality device the digital crown
[01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:14.280]  feels great the button's great it's every bit as good of build quality as apple's other
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:19.860]  aluminum stuff like the phones uh you're getting a totally great band yes it is a rubber it's
[01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:25.600]  a rubber wristband but it's really really good one it really is um so don't worry about
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:29.420]  it like if you're on the fence at all you know and and you can definitely swing the
[01:55:29.420 --> 01:55:33.820]  350 or 400 for the sport watch just get it and it's going to be it's going to be fine
[01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:37.220]  and especially if you're really just interested in playing with the platform like you're you're
[01:55:37.220 --> 01:55:45.480]  not getting uh a low-tier device if you do it but it's hard it is a hard thing when people
[01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:50.540]  just want you to say should i buy it or not because i do it's it to me i can't answer
[01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:55.500]  either way i cannot just say yes or no i can't wholeheartedly endorse it but i can't trash
[01:55:55.500 --> 01:56:01.700]  it either and i feel that business insider p some of those guys are jackasses um they're
[01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:06.460]  not i thought that if there's any you know we all had different takes about what we liked
[01:56:06.460 --> 01:56:11.180]  and what we didn't like i thought that the consensus was clearly this is a very interesting
[01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:17.660]  1.0 this is it there's some things that are definitely that they nailed like the fitness
[01:56:17.660 --> 01:56:22.780]  tracking and there's other stuff that is a question mark and i thought you know it i
[01:56:22.780 --> 01:56:28.100]  thought that was the consistency across the board that it's you know maybe depends it
[01:56:28.100 --> 01:56:33.980]  you know and you're not going to get a yes or no yeah and i think this like and apple's
[01:56:33.980 --> 01:56:39.580]  tagline for this was is on the money you know this is the most personal product ever it's
[01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:46.100]  very hard to review something so personal it's very hard to to to review something that
[01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:51.460]  specifically fits into i mean that fits on your body and fits into your life in a very
[01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:56.100]  distinct way yeah and i think it's really it's really hard to do some to to to review
[01:56:56.100 --> 01:57:00.060]  something where a big part of the appeal is whether you just think it's cool or not or
[01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:05.120]  fun um totally so i tell you what i you know i had to try it and there's only a few stores
[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:10.100]  that take there's not that many stores that take apple pay um but every time i use it
[01:57:10.100 --> 01:57:16.300]  at whole foods uh every single time the cashier notices and i'm not doing it in an ostentatious
[01:57:16.300 --> 01:57:22.820]  way i'm if anything the introvert in me is trying to sort not hide it but do it as surreptitiously
[01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:26.780]  as possible and i've paid with apple pay at my phone you know ever since the thing came
[01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:31.560]  out and i got a few comments about it when the phone first came out um but nothing like
[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:35.020]  with the watch with the watch every single time they're like oh my god did you just do
[01:57:35.020 --> 01:57:38.760]  what i think you did and i say yes and then they're like how did you know some of them
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:42.900]  know that the watch isn't out yet and they say how did you get it others i i had a cashier
[01:57:42.900 --> 01:57:46.940]  at whole foods who had no idea what apple watch was all she said was did you just pay
[01:57:46.940 --> 01:57:52.380]  with your watch and i said yes and she goes that is so cool and she i mean i could tell
[01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:55.700]  she did not know that it was an apple watch she didn't know the name of it all she knew
[01:57:55.700 --> 01:58:02.180]  is that i paid for my groceries with my watch and she said that is so cool see i found the
[01:58:02.180 --> 01:58:07.020]  same thing but at duane reed the woman behind the counter was like that's an apple watch
[01:58:07.020 --> 01:58:12.420]  and to me that showed the power of like how the excitement about this thing where she
[01:58:12.420 --> 01:58:18.460]  was like i'm buying one i'm buying one is it but you haven't seen it i'm buying one
[01:58:18.460 --> 01:58:25.780]  but you but you don't know about it you know and it was like she just was in awe of it
[01:58:25.780 --> 01:58:29.200]  she said she was buying it and of course it was like the first time i had tried it there
[01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:33.280]  so i wasn't really sure how to get apple pay working now i obviously have no problem i
[01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:36.720]  didn't that's another thing it's like not totally intuitive you got to press the button
[01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:43.820]  twice so i did this i here's what i did is the first place where i used the apple pay
[01:58:43.820 --> 01:58:52.300]  actually was in the apple store i had to my mom's long story but my mom broke her old
[01:58:52.300 --> 01:58:57.840]  ipad and so i was going up for easter and i thought you know what i'll just give her
[01:58:57.840 --> 01:59:01.940]  a mother's day gift early i'm going to get her a new ipad it was long out of warranty
[01:59:01.940 --> 01:59:11.140]  she was like an ipad too so i used apple pay to pay for an ipad for my mom and i didn't
[01:59:11.140 --> 01:59:14.100]  know how it worked and i didn't want to look it up i've really wanted to try to figure
[01:59:14.100 --> 01:59:18.740]  it out on my own and i knew that i had figured i had i had configured the thing you go through
[01:59:18.740 --> 01:59:23.980]  the phone to set up a credit card it doesn't just transfer your apples your existing cards
[01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:30.020]  over because it can't because when you set up a device for apple pay it's per device
[01:59:30.020 --> 01:59:36.540]  that's part of the security the privacy slash security of the way apple pay works it's per
[01:59:36.540 --> 01:59:41.380]  device so in the same way that if like you replace your iphone if it breaks and you replace
[01:59:41.380 --> 01:59:46.100]  it and you restore from backup you have to set up your cards again because it's not part
[01:59:46.100 --> 01:59:51.140]  of the device storage where apple pay gets stored you have to set up your watch the same
[01:59:51.140 --> 01:59:55.580]  way you do that though on the phone through the apple pay app you say i want to add a
[01:59:55.580 --> 02:00:00.300]  credit card and you can add the one from your itunes account very easily or you can take
[02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:04.020]  a picture of a card just like when you set one up on your phone but it's different you
[02:00:04.020 --> 02:00:07.900]  can't just you don't just get the ones that you have in your passbook on your phone so
[02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:11.820]  i knew i had set it up with the card and i went to the apple store and i didn't know
[02:00:11.820 --> 02:00:16.140]  how to set it up and i remember from the event he's something something about double clicking
[02:00:16.140 --> 02:00:21.300]  the button but i figured that was how you confirm it i thought it would be like the
[02:00:21.300 --> 02:00:25.380]  phone with the phone you just wave it and then it says okay you want to pay this and
[02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:30.180]  then you do the touch id and it goes through so i figured i'll just wave my watch at the
[02:00:30.180 --> 02:00:36.860]  thing and it will come on and then i'll double tap that button um and the clerk at the apple
[02:00:36.860 --> 02:00:42.940]  store was like holy cow how did you get that you know and it was you know i i you know
[02:00:42.940 --> 02:00:46.720]  felt a little bit like a jerk and i wasn't trying to like you know lord it around if
[02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:51.260]  anything again the introvert in me was trying to like you know hey let's keep this down
[02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:54.260]  i'm allowed to use it you know and they're like are you right right you're allowed to
[02:00:54.260 --> 02:00:57.420]  do it they want you to try it but let's just keep it between us from now and then you can
[02:00:57.420 --> 02:01:01.700]  tell everybody that somebody came in here with a watch um but john i hate to cut you
[02:01:01.700 --> 02:01:07.660]  off right now but my puppy just pooped on the wheelie pad oh god please go and he and
[02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:12.380]  he we're so proud of him every time i'll be back in two seconds don't edit this out don't
[02:01:12.380 --> 02:01:32.740]  edit this out come here good boy good boy you're such a good boy good boy hello hello
[02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:39.100]  hi that was so great yeah it's it's a big moment when this happens no that's he's actually
[02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:42.540]  really it i don't want to i don't want to say it too loud so here's it but i think he's
[02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:45.900]  a genius how can he be doing it if you've he's only if he's only been with you a week
[02:01:45.900 --> 02:01:49.260]  how in the world is he already being oh he's been in here he's been with us for like three
[02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:53.740]  days how is that possible yeah he might be a genius i know and he's constantly going
[02:01:53.740 --> 02:01:57.580]  on the pad and we can't take him outside yet because when they're on the ground you know
[02:01:57.580 --> 02:02:03.200]  they're parva parvo some it's what this disease thing lives in the ground in new york city
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:07.820]  for dogs because there's so many dogs and he's not fully vaccinated so he can't go outside
[02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:11.900]  oh i didn't know about that yeah so that's why he's got to go inside we don't want him
[02:02:11.900 --> 02:02:15.500]  we don't want to train the dog to go inside but we have to for the next five weeks because
[02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:20.140]  oh wow until he gets these shots then he can go outside wow that's weird i had no idea
[02:02:20.140 --> 02:02:24.380]  yeah it's like new york's because there's so many dogs everywhere it lives in the dog's
[02:02:24.380 --> 02:02:29.780]  poop and pee you know so if the other dog sees it and eats it or whatever you know it's
[02:02:29.780 --> 02:02:39.420]  anyway uh apple pay at the apple store yeah uh so and so you figured it out yeah well
[02:02:39.420 --> 02:02:45.220]  you know the clerk had the uh the little hand reader and with the phone you just put your
[02:02:45.220 --> 02:02:49.620]  phone up against theirs and then it initiates and i'm waving my apple watch against the
[02:02:49.620 --> 02:02:55.740]  thing and nothing is happening and i'm like oh man i really wanted to try this out um
[02:02:55.740 --> 02:02:59.260]  and i guess i had tried now i think about i had tried it at whole foods before and it
[02:02:59.260 --> 02:03:04.620]  didn't wake up and i thought hmm and it was a it was a it was like you know the the right
[02:03:04.620 --> 02:03:09.820]  before dinner you know 6 30 7 o'clock rush and i didn't want to hold the line so i thought
[02:03:09.820 --> 02:03:13.020]  i'll come back i'm here all the time i'll come back tomorrow so this time at the apple
[02:03:13.020 --> 02:03:17.020]  store though i thought i got to figure this out and that's i only by trial and error did
[02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:23.140]  i figure out you got to do the double press first and then wave it against it um and you
[02:03:23.140 --> 02:03:27.880]  know i don't know if that's it i'm not even sure what the thinking is i think the explanation
[02:03:27.880 --> 02:03:32.180]  is it lowers the battery life because then the nfc thing is only listening when you've
[02:03:32.180 --> 02:03:37.480]  double tapped whereas your phone is always listening for an nfc connection i'm not quite
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:41.500]  sure or maybe it's i i don't know but it is a little different but then once you know
[02:03:41.500 --> 02:03:47.340]  it is it an authentic authentication thing can i say that word yeah maybe because because
[02:03:47.340 --> 02:03:52.980]  on your phone you've got to hold down touch id right and on the watch it's just a double
[02:03:52.980 --> 02:03:56.540]  tap and so this you know having to put it in that mode first decreases the chance that
[02:03:56.540 --> 02:04:02.540]  someone could just sneak by your wrist and you know start an apple pay you know connection
[02:04:02.540 --> 02:04:08.660]  right once you know it it's a cinch and i have to say it is i know it sounds so stupid
[02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:14.780]  and so lazy but it's even easier than paying with your phone i agree at first i mean it
[02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:18.440]  is a little awkward because you're like holding your wrist in a certain way you know you're
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:23.660]  flipping your wrist upside down but it's so brief and it's so quick it's i've actually
[02:04:23.660 --> 02:04:26.860]  found i think it's quicker than my iphone because sometimes my iphone has problems with
[02:04:26.860 --> 02:04:30.880]  touch id now i don't know if it's just a couple you know now that i've been using it so much
[02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:37.100]  should i probably unlock my phone you know i think 100 times a day whatever um that it
[02:04:37.100 --> 02:04:40.660]  that it seems faster than using my phone i mean also obviously you don't have to pull
[02:04:40.660 --> 02:04:44.900]  out your phone so that process is much faster as well yeah and part of that too is we're
[02:04:44.900 --> 02:04:48.460]  still at the tail end of the winter season on the east coast and so when i am out shopping
[02:04:48.460 --> 02:04:53.620]  i'm wearing a coat and it's harder to get in my pocket to get the phone out etc etc
[02:04:53.620 --> 02:04:59.740]  so apple pay is great i i think it's and i think it and it is absolutely positively a
[02:04:59.740 --> 02:05:04.260]  selling a public selling point of the thing where people see you doing it in public and
[02:05:04.260 --> 02:05:09.500]  then they want to buy an apple watch i mean it's it really is it sells the apple watch
[02:05:09.500 --> 02:05:13.420]  and it's the silliest thing do you again if so many of the reviews are like do you need
[02:05:13.420 --> 02:05:17.220]  it no of course not you don't need any of this stuff you know you don't even need a
[02:05:17.220 --> 02:05:20.780]  watch to tell time you can get you know you get the time from your phone i mean you don't
[02:05:20.780 --> 02:05:24.940]  need there's not a single thing on it that you need me it's the wrong question to ask
[02:05:24.940 --> 02:05:30.420]  and apple pay is right there you do not need apple pay but is it nice and is it cool then
[02:05:30.420 --> 02:05:38.060]  definitely right no i i and that experience with that running thing i mean basically in
[02:05:38.060 --> 02:05:43.820]  that whole you know 20 or 30 minutes of of that experience i was able to experience pretty
[02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:49.060]  much everything you can do without using your phone and that's you know yes more and more
[02:05:49.060 --> 02:05:54.020]  stuff will become separate from the phone i think in future whether it be in this generation
[02:05:54.020 --> 02:06:00.100]  or more generations future generations of the product and that's really freeing all

[02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:15.660]  all right third party apps on apple watch they suck they suck they're just slow they're
[02:09:15.660 --> 02:09:20.640]  really really slow i mean i don't know i actually wouldn't know if they suck because i've never
[02:09:20.640 --> 02:09:25.520]  really waited for one of them to load have you ever gotten uber to load i got it to load
[02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:30.160]  no i've never gotten it so i got it to load one time and then it didn't do anything and
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:35.920]  i talked to neil i neil i said he was getting it to work one day but it it didn't tell him
[02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:40.540]  which side of the building it thought he was on and like the guy came to the you know the
[02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:43.680]  other side of the i guess the verge office has like a front entrance and a back entrance
[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:47.280]  and the guy was like waiting at the other side because it just you know whereas you
[02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:51.680]  use on your phone it tells you exactly where it thinks it's going to pick you up but everybody
[02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:55.920]  else i know it's like i i can't believe that they published the app i know that they wanted
[02:09:55.920 --> 02:10:01.800]  apps in the app store so that those of us with review units could have some to try but
[02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:06.520]  i can't believe the uber one got through like nobody nobody gets it to work it just sits
[02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:11.040]  there yeah i'm pulsing blue and that actually is another thing i did when i was setting
[02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:15.560]  up my watch i kind of took off pretty much almost all these apps because i found my i
[02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:20.980]  hate the app screen i hate that screen i can never accurately touch anything on here the
[02:10:20.980 --> 02:10:27.000]  digital crown is really not very useful to me to be honest um and so i just took off
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:31.220]  most of the apps on here that's an interesting that's an interesting complaint and i feel
[02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:36.200]  the same way i feel like it is really hard to tap an individual icon and whether it's
[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:41.880]  first party or third party whether it's one of apples or not um yeah i kind of wish that
[02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:46.420]  the default size for the icons would be a little bigger like you can zoom in and zoom
[02:10:46.420 --> 02:10:51.800]  out but when you're sort of there sort of is a default size where it settles in that
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:57.400]  and i feel like it shows too many apps as opposed to showing fewer bigger apps to make
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:11:03.280]  them easier touch targets i i still two weeks later like if i delete ones why wouldn't it
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:09.680]  just become bigger like why you know as you delete these little icons they don't become
[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:15.360]  bigger i just wish that as you zoom the crown that you could stop at a bigger spot yes and
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:19.400]  then it would stay there as opposed to you you make them a little bigger and then you
[02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:24.960]  let and you just go and let go and it just settles back totally agree totally agree uh
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:32.640]  yeah i i can't help but think they're going to i have to address this it's really it's
[02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:37.460]  it's just too finicky it's you know and it and it comes back to stuff that apple even
[02:11:37.460 --> 02:11:43.420]  bragged about with the iphone where where they measured you know optimal touch sizes
[02:11:43.420 --> 02:11:51.320]  for average fingertips and then you know knowing that the original iphone was 163 you know
[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:58.500]  pixels per inch that means that the minimum you know touch size is 40 and you know two
[02:11:58.500 --> 02:12:02.600]  different buttons should be at least this far apart to avoid accidentally touching one
[02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:07.880]  when you meant the other and all those details of how many pixels it was and now with the
[02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:11.480]  retina screens it's all in points which are double the size but you can just deal with
[02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:16.220]  them the same way you have to be a developer designer to care about the specific numbers
[02:12:16.220 --> 02:12:21.080]  but as a user all it meant was when you used an iphone the thing you thought you were tapping
[02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:25.380]  was the thing you were tapping almost every time whereas on yeah and i thought you know
[02:12:25.380 --> 02:12:31.160]  i thought this might be a reason to get the bigger screen but it sounds like i mean it
[02:12:31.160 --> 02:12:36.760]  also assumes that if you have a bigger screen you've got bigger fingers um but those touch
[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:41.560]  targets aren't even any better on the bigger screen yeah i don't think so now that doesn't
[02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:45.920]  mean though that there isn't an easy way to launch some of these apps because one of the
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:49.580]  things that i don't think apple is emphasized enough is that from the regular watch face
[02:12:49.580 --> 02:12:53.820]  if you have a complication up you can just tap it to go to that app so i always have
[02:12:53.820 --> 02:12:58.180]  the temperature up on all of the watch faces that i use and if i tap the temperature from
[02:12:58.180 --> 02:13:04.080]  my watch face right it jumps me to the weather app and it seems as though the touch target
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:08.980]  for that is it's like the whole corner it's the whole corner of the display and it always
[02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:13.240]  works i don't miss it and i never tap the wrong thing and get something else whereas
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:17.780]  from that right that's how i get to my activity app i don't even i don't even know if they're
[02:13:17.780 --> 02:13:23.500]  calling at the home screen um i maybe they are but i don't even think of it as the home
[02:13:23.500 --> 02:13:28.420]  screen and i it's like one of the things you have to get used to is as an iphone or ipad
[02:13:28.420 --> 02:13:32.620]  user is you think of the home screen as the thing where you've hit a button and you see
[02:13:32.620 --> 02:13:37.060]  all your apps and then that's your home screen to me the home screen on the watch is the
[02:13:37.060 --> 02:13:41.780]  watch face and you can figure that the way you want it with your most used things and
[02:13:41.780 --> 02:13:47.220]  you launch things there and the home screen on the watch the the one you launch the apps
[02:13:47.220 --> 02:13:53.580]  from i hate to say it because i think it's you know it to me it's like the android all
[02:13:53.580 --> 02:14:00.660]  apps screen i was just thinking the same thing it really is it's the but yeah it's like a
[02:14:00.660 --> 02:14:06.020]  tap away like that's what i don't like the digital crown i just feel like i wish i could
[02:14:06.020 --> 02:14:13.820]  map that button to be something else instead of going to the all your apps yes yeah i don't
[02:14:13.820 --> 02:14:20.340]  know it's like i see why it's there and it's i just wish i could make them bigger and uh
[02:14:20.340 --> 02:14:25.460]  and it is an interesting way to just say okay here's everything else i mean and that's the
[02:14:25.460 --> 02:14:30.820]  design of it the way that you don't even organize them into pages i kind of like that uh i kind
[02:14:30.820 --> 02:14:34.720]  of like that you don't have to organize it i feel like fiddly fiddling with the exact
[02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:38.660]  placement of which apps are on which screen on your iphone can get old after a time i
[02:14:38.660 --> 02:14:43.100]  kind of like that it's just this big globby thing that you can glide around i could actually
[02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:46.980]  see that even working on the iphone at least as an option it might be that everybody's
[02:14:46.980 --> 02:14:50.820]  muscle memory is so much that they can't just change it to be like that for everybody but
[02:14:50.820 --> 02:14:57.660]  as an option i might that might be an interesting way to to get your apps on on an iphone um
[02:14:57.660 --> 02:15:02.820]  my favorite thing is like i just it it makes me wonder like did they like who did they
[02:15:02.820 --> 02:15:10.340]  think could when you hold down to delete an app you get the tiny little x i mean at like
[02:15:10.340 --> 02:15:16.300]  i said in my like the video like is this for people with really small doll fingers like
[02:15:16.300 --> 02:15:21.940]  how are you supposed to delete that like you can you can hit it but like it's you're really
[02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:26.420]  holding your watch up close to your face to delete this that's one of the features where
[02:15:26.420 --> 02:15:32.380]  you can do it both from the watch and from the app on the phone and i kind of feel like
[02:15:32.380 --> 02:15:38.940]  maybe they should have made that just a uh just a phone only thing and there's other
[02:15:38.940 --> 02:15:43.840]  things where the tap targets to me are are pretty good so like when you're picking a
[02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:48.540]  button like you're texting with somebody and you're like reply and then it gives you a
[02:15:48.540 --> 02:15:55.840]  bunch of options to choose from like yes no okay absolutely um those are generously sized
[02:15:55.840 --> 02:16:00.140]  and i you know i don't find myself miss tapping on them i feel like they're big enough but
[02:16:00.140 --> 02:16:06.620]  these little app icons on the app launching screen are too small yeah aesthetically i
[02:16:06.620 --> 02:16:10.620]  see why they did it but it's i i really can't believe that it passed their own internal
[02:16:10.620 --> 02:16:16.300]  use and the thing with the third-party apps is this the way that they work i don't want
[02:16:16.300 --> 02:16:20.420]  to go into technical details of it but they're they're not really apps they're called watch
[02:16:20.420 --> 02:16:25.780]  kit extensions and you have to have the app on your phone there's a real app on your phone
[02:16:25.780 --> 02:16:32.060]  for every one of them there's no such thing yet as a watch only app third third party
[02:16:32.060 --> 02:16:36.820]  so it's running on your phone you can optionally for any app on your phone that has a watch
[02:16:36.820 --> 02:16:43.340]  kit extension you can choose whether it is there or not on your watch uh using the apple
[02:16:43.340 --> 02:16:47.740]  watch app on your phone and if it's there it's there but then when you run it it doesn't
[02:16:47.740 --> 02:16:52.620]  really run on your phone it's not executing code on the cpu on the watch i mean it doesn't
[02:16:52.620 --> 02:16:57.420]  really run on the watch it doesn't execute code on the watch it transmits over bluetooth
[02:16:57.420 --> 02:17:03.100]  to your phone and it executes on your phone and then it projects these views onto your
[02:17:03.100 --> 02:17:08.500]  watch your watch more or less is sort of like a carplay display except it's only an inch
[02:17:08.500 --> 02:17:14.480]  big um and it means everything is a little laggy it is super laggy to load it's laggy
[02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:21.580]  to get data and it's even like button pushes are laggy yeah and i've known i mean even
[02:17:21.580 --> 02:17:29.220]  just to me the going through glances is laggy oh even the glances hmm like like paging through
[02:17:29.220 --> 02:17:36.960]  the glances yeah because sometimes they're not loaded yet right but i do do you use the
[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:41.260]  glances i do use the glances that's the other thing that i feel like keeps you from going
[02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:46.140]  to that app launching home screen is for the stuff that i do most frequently i just go
[02:17:46.140 --> 02:17:54.380]  to the glance yeah um i don't use it all that much um the heart rate and then the battery
[02:17:54.380 --> 02:17:59.260]  life yeah what about the now playing now playing is pretty cool yeah that's why i don't use
[02:17:59.260 --> 02:18:03.020]  it i mean i guess when i'm running i have but i haven't really been using it too much
[02:18:03.020 --> 02:18:06.780]  so the now playing glance i think it's pretty cool so whatever your iphone is playing whether
[02:18:06.780 --> 02:18:12.580]  it has a watch extension or not if it's playing audio on your phone to your headphones you
[02:18:12.580 --> 02:18:20.180]  can control you know play play pause fast forward from the watch using the glance yeah
[02:18:20.180 --> 02:18:27.460]  sorry this puppy's destroying the apartment if you need to go just go you just just drop
[02:18:27.460 --> 02:18:32.620]  your mic i'm just watching him it's almost better because i'm like i can't communicate
[02:18:32.620 --> 02:18:38.460]  with this dog right now so it's like i have like a little bit of a eye into his brain
[02:18:38.460 --> 02:18:42.100]  i'm like okay this is what you really want to do and you don't have my attention because
[02:18:42.100 --> 02:18:49.060]  i can't like respond back the bottom line is it doesn't make me not like the watch but
[02:18:49.060 --> 02:18:54.820]  it makes me question whether there should be third-party apps for it at all yet yeah
[02:18:54.820 --> 02:18:59.660]  i mean i to me like that was a thought i had early on when i got this thing was i just
[02:18:59.660 --> 02:19:06.660]  could not believe how much apple was trying to do with it in a first generation product
[02:19:06.660 --> 02:19:13.100]  certainly ambitious but it's just a lot and it's very confusing i mean it takes a little
[02:19:13.100 --> 02:19:17.540]  bit of time a couple of days to figure out how to use this i see i think confusing is
[02:19:17.540 --> 02:19:25.460]  slightly wrong because confusing it to me it's disorienting at first whereas confusing
[02:19:25.460 --> 02:19:31.020]  to me implies that there's no logical layout to it to me it's like it's like you're in
[02:19:31.020 --> 02:19:35.620]  a well laid out building but it's a big enough building that it's going to take you a couple
[02:19:35.620 --> 02:19:40.540]  of days to figure out your way around but then once you do there's a sense to it like
[02:19:40.540 --> 02:19:46.180]  i do think it's very logically designed in a good way but there's no question about it
[02:19:46.180 --> 02:19:50.420]  that when you first strap it on your wrist it is disorienting and you're like well how
[02:19:50.420 --> 02:19:54.740]  in the world do i turn this off and it's you you know you're spending half your time poking
[02:19:54.740 --> 02:19:59.180]  around your wrist and half your time poking around the watch on your phone and it's it's
[02:19:59.180 --> 02:20:06.340]  confusing well i just said confusing so maybe it is confusing i think it's i to me the biggest
[02:20:06.340 --> 02:20:12.260]  source of confusion is the stuff that what's on the phone to control the watch and what's
[02:20:12.260 --> 02:20:16.260]  on the watch itself that took me a long time and you kind of have to learn it on a case
[02:20:16.260 --> 02:20:26.060]  by case basis yeah yeah no i mean the it's funny like the companion app i did not talk
[02:20:26.060 --> 02:20:30.980]  enough talk enough about but it really that's what you've got to live in in the first couple
[02:20:30.980 --> 02:20:35.300]  of days when you're first setting this thing yes absolutely like it's you know i think
[02:20:35.300 --> 02:20:38.460]  it's going to stay on your first iphone home screen but it's definitely it should be on
[02:20:38.460 --> 02:20:41.820]  your first iphone home screen when you're first setting it it's on mine yeah it still
[02:20:41.820 --> 02:20:47.860]  is um yeah there's other cool stuff though like this stuff and again i don't think notifications
[02:20:47.860 --> 02:20:53.020]  are a huge reason for it i i know you know everybody i think i think some people it's
[02:20:53.020 --> 02:20:57.060]  a big deal but i think there's a reason why apple isn't making that a flagship tentpole
[02:20:57.060 --> 02:21:01.420]  thing that they're not even talking about notifications it's the you know using it as
[02:21:01.420 --> 02:21:05.620]  a watch using it as a status indicator for things like the weather and your appointments
[02:21:05.620 --> 02:21:12.480]  and your fitness goals and stuff like that and then to me just the glances where you're
[02:21:12.480 --> 02:21:18.140]  not using apps you're just quickly seeing something are the to me the primary points
[02:21:18.140 --> 02:21:24.580]  and then this communication stuff who knows we have to see how that goes and the fitness
[02:21:24.580 --> 02:21:29.220]  stuff for sure and then the fitness stuff definitely but it's it's almost like a wholly
[02:21:29.220 --> 02:21:38.020]  separate product category right um all right last but not least the new macbook yes i've
[02:21:38.020 --> 02:21:42.340]  got probably got like 10 minutes till that this guy's good jumps out absolutely perfectly
[02:21:42.340 --> 02:21:50.700]  i think we can cover it quickly because it's to me i i thought your review was a little
[02:21:50.700 --> 02:21:57.860]  harsh in a way that i feel like you you you're a little down on it overall because the battery
[02:21:57.860 --> 02:22:06.660]  life isn't as good and living with one port is it's it seems early like in your your whole
[02:22:06.660 --> 02:22:11.340]  gimmick of it the gimmick of your the conceit of your video is that it's a it's a laptop
[02:22:11.340 --> 02:22:17.780]  from the future right out the ecosystem to support it i think it's you know i feel like
[02:22:17.780 --> 02:22:22.420]  what you underplayed is exactly how much it's the scenario is like the original macbook
[02:22:22.420 --> 02:22:28.460]  air which to me it's just it's just a replay of that right right except no i totally accepted
[02:22:28.460 --> 02:22:34.080]  the original macbook air was even more outrageously priced if you know it was like it was like
[02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:43.500]  over two thousand dollars true true i you know i came at it looking at there's two ways
[02:22:43.500 --> 02:22:50.020]  of looking at it right one was the price for what you get and then there was how much does
[02:22:50.020 --> 02:22:55.580]  this thing push the boundaries of what we have right now in our current laptops so you
[02:22:55.580 --> 02:23:00.660]  know i was trying to look at it from both of those places and you're right in the end
[02:23:00.660 --> 02:23:05.840]  like i came at it a little bit harsh because i think for me there was no way i was going
[02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:11.500]  to get this thing and certainly there there are definitely people i've heard from that
[02:23:11.500 --> 02:23:16.220]  said okay that's great it's not for you but i'm definitely getting one and the main reasons
[02:23:16.220 --> 02:23:22.100]  that i wanted it were for the reasons that it pushed ahead laptops like it's so incredibly
[02:23:22.100 --> 02:23:28.740]  beautiful this machine it just i mean i love the trackpad the keyboard is is nice but that's
[02:23:28.740 --> 02:23:33.660]  you know just between the trackpad and the screen i really want this thing and then there
[02:23:33.660 --> 02:23:38.140]  were all of these other things that when you looked at it in comparison to what you can
[02:23:38.140 --> 02:23:43.100]  get for the price for other laptops it just didn't measure up and it was this obviously
[02:23:43.100 --> 02:23:47.260]  this push and pull of the compromise situation which was the same with the original macbook
[02:23:47.260 --> 02:23:53.000]  with the original air and you know both the performance and the battery life and that
[02:23:53.000 --> 02:24:00.040]  one port i just felt like that is not pushing something ahead and i liked what your comment
[02:24:00.040 --> 02:24:05.840]  was you know in terms of looking at it in terms of comparing to the ipad but again when
[02:24:05.840 --> 02:24:09.840]  you think about the ipad you're you take a performance hit it doesn't have and it's not
[02:24:09.840 --> 02:24:13.880]  supposed to have the same performance as a laptop as a computer right i mean obviously
[02:24:13.880 --> 02:24:18.680]  those lines are blurring as we forge into this interesting area of these devices being
[02:24:18.680 --> 02:24:25.800]  both but you take a big performance hit on this laptop and it's i felt it it's a noticeable
[02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:30.600]  performance hit coming from the air and it's a noticeable one in battery life now of course
[02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:34.240]  the battery life has different things right if you compare it to the 11 inch air it's
[02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:39.000]  getting more battery life which is impressive but most people coming from a 13 inch air
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:43.920]  which is very portable for them has the power they need we're used to all day battery life
[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:48.760]  and i just was not getting all day battery life from this thing i used to use it i use
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:53.000]  an 11 inch air for years and i because i'm the sort if if i'm going to go in one direction
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:56.680]  i like to go to the extreme if i'm going to get the lightest smallest laptop i want the
[02:24:56.680 --> 02:25:02.400]  light i want it even smaller i want the 11 not the 13 um but i think if you look at sales
[02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:09.400]  numbers and if you just sort of eyeball coffee shops the 13 inch is clearly the the main
[02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:15.840]  apple the 13 inch air is the flagship apple laptop like or maybe flagship's the wrong
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:20.000]  word but it's certainly the most common one and it's so therefore it's the baseline to
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:24.220]  compare everything against and i think it's fair to say therefore i think it's fair to
[02:25:24.220 --> 02:25:27.640]  say the new macbook gets worse battery life even if it's better than the 11 because i
[02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:34.920]  feel like it's it's a it's eventually going to replace the 13 as we go on right i think
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:42.240]  the thing that most a lot of people complaining about it um what they really wanted i feel
[02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:46.960]  like is a ice water and hell scenario like you can't just because you want it doesn't
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:50.820]  mean it's possible as i think what most people who are disappointed wanted was for apple
[02:25:50.820 --> 02:25:56.080]  to just put retina screens in the macbook air that i love everything else about my air
[02:25:56.080 --> 02:26:00.940]  all i want is a retina screen why couldn't you just give me that keep my usb ports keep
[02:26:00.940 --> 02:26:06.880]  my magsafe charger um let me have a thunderbolt i you know if you it certainly if you plug
[02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:10.180]  this thing into a thunderbolt display you're screwed because the uh eighty dollar adapter
[02:26:10.180 --> 02:26:15.740]  doesn't even have thunderbolt um and why couldn't you just give me that and i think the reason
[02:26:15.740 --> 02:26:20.300]  you can't you couldn't do that is that it it clearly these retina screens take up so
[02:26:20.300 --> 02:26:26.800]  much more battery power that the air form factor wouldn't work it had to be re-engineered
[02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:32.660]  right and i i would obviously love that product i would love that product and it's part of
[02:26:32.660 --> 02:26:36.640]  why i'm at this point considering getting a retina 13 because actually the battery life
[02:26:36.640 --> 02:26:41.320]  has gotten better on that 13 it has force touch it has the retina screen i actually
[02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:46.840]  think it's a bad laptop is is a better buy at some points now than the 13 inch air especially
[02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:54.180]  if you're not on a strict budget yeah but um yeah i i mean to me it just it was a hard
[02:26:54.180 --> 02:26:59.640]  it's it's hard to recommend to people but it is an amazing feat of engineering it is
[02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:05.740]  a beautiful laptop and it's a pleasure to use when you are plugged into a wall and don't
[02:27:05.740 --> 02:27:09.820]  need anything else yeah from and for the people who are out there and i know that it people
[02:27:09.820 --> 02:27:13.300]  like us like people who really push the machines don't qualify for it but i think out in the
[02:27:13.300 --> 02:27:17.020]  real world there are a lot of people who are like i've never plugged anything into my macbook
[02:27:17.020 --> 02:27:21.300]  and i've heard from people who say like that they're you know yes they you know i read
[02:27:21.300 --> 02:27:25.820]  during fireball but my husband or my wife or whoever that they know their daughter or
[02:27:25.820 --> 02:27:30.240]  whatever their son never plugs anything in their life into the macbook well then it might
[02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:34.540]  be a great machine right and and that's where like people are saying well i don't need that
[02:27:34.540 --> 02:27:38.740]  power i don't need it to well then that's great you're paying for this beautiful design
[02:27:38.740 --> 02:27:44.660]  and this beautiful screen but you're compromising the power and the battery life um and that's
[02:27:44.660 --> 02:27:51.740]  fine but you're paying more money to get less you know albeit less functionality the other
[02:27:51.740 --> 02:27:59.020]  thing last but not least is that one usb-c port and i know john seracusa has he seems
[02:27:59.020 --> 02:28:03.360]  to truly confounded by i'm not quite caught up on the accidental tech podcast as we record
[02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:10.260]  this but i know he's gone over why not two why only one why one right and i don't i cannot
[02:28:10.260 --> 02:28:15.140]  bring myself to believe that it's engineering i cannot believe that they couldn't that that
[02:28:15.140 --> 02:28:20.580]  putting a second one in would decrease you know obviously it would take some space and
[02:28:20.580 --> 02:28:24.020]  therefore take a little bit of the battery space away i just can't believe it would matter
[02:28:24.020 --> 02:28:28.440]  that much for something that clearly is a pretty small part i think it's a philosophical
[02:28:28.440 --> 02:28:35.420]  thing where they philosophically wanted to make it like the ipad where there's one port
[02:28:35.420 --> 02:28:42.460]  and the downfall of that though is that nobody has ever grown the habit of charging devices
[02:28:42.460 --> 02:28:50.740]  from their ipad and the and the ipad gets longer battery life too um yeah i mean just
[02:28:50.740 --> 02:28:55.940]  just by the nature that have we use it right like i don't charge my ipad every day because
[02:28:55.940 --> 02:29:01.100]  i don't live on it every day right i mean i charge it every couple of days by my nightstand
[02:29:01.100 --> 02:29:05.820]  just because i like to have more power in it no i don't have different people use usb
[02:29:05.820 --> 02:29:08.620]  ports for all sorts of different things i know photographers you know are plugging in
[02:29:08.620 --> 02:29:12.740]  the cameras and they're you know and they're all sorts of other things peripherals external
[02:29:12.740 --> 02:29:17.820]  hard drives for some people but the one to me the apple to me maybe is a little bit of
[02:29:17.820 --> 02:29:24.520]  denial with on the the one port on the macbook is and you and i just talked about this half
[02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:30.080]  an hour ago is the need to charge your iphone during the day and i know i've done it i've
[02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:35.420]  done it when i'm out of the house and working remotely that i don't even plug i'll you know
[02:29:35.420 --> 02:29:39.300]  like from the train and amtrak if i can't if i'm don't have a working ac adapter next
[02:29:39.300 --> 02:29:43.380]  to me or if i'm don't have the window seat and i don't want to reach across a stranger
[02:29:43.380 --> 02:29:47.900]  to plug in i'll just plug my phone because i know that i'm going to get home from to
[02:29:47.900 --> 02:29:52.340]  philly from new york with plenty of battery life on my macbook pro i'll just borrow some
[02:29:52.340 --> 02:29:59.860]  of that and reduce my phone and if you're also charging your macbook you can't do that
[02:29:59.860 --> 02:30:03.180]  right right and there are sometimes when your macbooks already run down and you want to
[02:30:03.180 --> 02:30:08.120]  charge your phone and you need that second port just as a charger right you need this
[02:30:08.120 --> 02:30:14.180]  dongle basically you need this dongle to get by with using this laptop in my opinion again
[02:30:14.180 --> 02:30:17.980]  it's like they should just bundle the dongle which they're definitely not going to ever
[02:30:17.980 --> 02:30:22.580]  do and they charge eight dollars and again and the eighty dollar price on that really
[02:30:22.580 --> 02:30:29.820]  plays into the worst of perceiving apple because to me it's it's actually accurate it is they're
[02:30:29.820 --> 02:30:34.180]  they're the richest company in the world and they're charging and they're charging for
[02:30:34.180 --> 02:30:40.880]  plastic for an eighty dollar thing that is quite frankly ugly by necessity right like
[02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:46.460]  you take it's got to have three ports it's like you take you've taken this graceful little
[02:30:46.460 --> 02:30:52.180]  tiny elegant as usbc port and turned it into this big white thing that looks like it's
[02:30:52.180 --> 02:30:56.800]  you know like something they would hook up to you in a hospital with three ugly ports
[02:30:56.800 --> 02:31:04.540]  on it or two ugly ports and one more usbc port right i mean yeah i mean i i guess i
[02:31:04.540 --> 02:31:09.020]  i should have looked at it a little bit closer to the ipad and that use case and i certainly
[02:31:09.020 --> 02:31:14.860]  think that is the way we are going and that's where i think like as we as this future evolves
[02:31:14.860 --> 02:31:20.100]  like that is what our computers look like it's like all we need is a screen with a flat
[02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:25.400]  piece of keyboard and you know and actually it's very close to what microsoft's been trying
[02:31:25.400 --> 02:31:31.220]  to do with the surface for a long time now but more and more when i review that surface
[02:31:31.220 --> 02:31:36.100]  or use that surface i just wish it was a laptop so i i really like the way they've gone with
[02:31:36.100 --> 02:31:42.020]  this you know what remains interesting to me or remain you know we don't know yet is
[02:31:42.020 --> 02:31:48.340]  what that ipad pro might look like right and how do those how are those any different than
[02:31:48.340 --> 02:31:54.420]  what we've seen with the macbook but i think it's pretty clear um like where you know when
[02:31:54.420 --> 02:31:58.280]  something starts as a laptop and has some of that tablet functionality or we have that
[02:31:58.280 --> 02:32:03.460]  tablet that becomes that laptop where the sacrifices are in this case it just seems
[02:32:03.460 --> 02:32:09.040]  like we are making too many sacrifices to move in that direction and i think for everybody
[02:32:09.040 --> 02:32:12.380]  like us and the people who probably listen to this show it is it's a device from the
[02:32:12.380 --> 02:32:17.880]  future it's a prototype from the future that's not ready for our day-to-day use but it will
[02:32:17.880 --> 02:32:22.420]  be and i think it's it's a clear bet from apple that two or three years from now we
[02:32:22.420 --> 02:32:27.340]  are going to be using a laptop that really is just as much a little peripheral as the
[02:32:27.340 --> 02:32:32.900]  ipad is right and what i love about it is it means like there is this huge bright future
[02:32:32.900 --> 02:32:40.720]  for laptops um or just devices that we can be highly productive on that don't look like
[02:32:40.720 --> 02:32:45.460]  this traditional computer or laptop we've we've known right i mean and that's what the
[02:32:45.460 --> 02:32:50.320]  air was right and that was such a huge step in the industry and this this is also going
[02:32:50.320 --> 02:32:55.600]  to be a huge step in the industry there's no way we're not going to see asus or microsoft
[02:32:55.600 --> 02:33:01.300]  or some other pc manufacturer taking notes from this and trying to do something very
[02:33:01.300 --> 02:33:08.460]  similar very soon uh great point thank you so much for your time amazing thank you so
[02:33:08.460 --> 02:33:15.780]  much for reviewing so many products in one week yeah never again i say never again but
[02:33:15.780 --> 02:33:20.400]  of course and getting a puppy in this all while getting a new probably the worst mistake
[02:33:20.400 --> 02:33:31.060]  of it uh the home page uh best place to read uh is wsjd.com is that yeah is yeah that's
[02:33:31.060 --> 02:33:38.340]  the home page for the wall street journal digital team uh joanna stern some of the unbelievable
[02:33:38.340 --> 02:33:41.460]  timing because i would have wanted to have you on to talk about the macbook i would have
[02:33:41.460 --> 02:33:44.560]  wanted you to have you on to talk about the apple watch and i got to have you on to talk
[02:33:44.560 --> 02:33:50.340]  about both so i cannot thank you enough for your time yeah no i love doing it all right
[02:33:50.340 --> 02:33:54.220]  good luck with i gotta find my own positive podcast or something i don't know i just can't
[02:33:54.220 --> 02:34:09.420]  find the time it's surprising how hard it can be yeah good luck with the dog poop
