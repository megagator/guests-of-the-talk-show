[00:00.000 --> 00:09.620]  So Joanna at Stern you have a new puppy. What in it's a boy? It's a boy. What's his name? I had a boy. It's a boy. What's his name? His name is browser.
[00:09.620 --> 00:18.800]  Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. As in not as in safari Firefox or Chrome. Just browser.
[00:18.800 --> 00:28.900]  We show no platform. We're platform agnostic in the in the puppy family here. Somehow browser makes for a good dog name, but any one of the individual ones would be a terrible name.
[00:28.900 --> 00:35.520]  I know. We had so many things on the list and my wife said no to pretty much every other technique I had on the list.
[00:35.520 --> 00:39.560]  I mean, I think quality is a mistake. I think we should have named him quality.
[00:39.560 --> 00:45.000]  Mm-hmm. I'm trying to think which browser would make for the worst name, i.e.
[00:45.000 --> 00:52.400]  Come here, i.e. Come here, i.e. Chrome sounds a little cold. Oh, you crashed again. He crashed.
[00:52.400 --> 00:58.440]  Yeah. Yeah, so he's adorable. He's really adorable. I've turned into that person that I hate,
[00:58.440 --> 01:03.800]  which I'm constantly posting photos of my puppy doing like the same thing that he did five minutes ago.
[01:03.800 --> 01:10.120]  Um, like right now, he's sleeping under my desk and I'm doing it's taking everything in me not to post another photo of him.
[01:10.120 --> 01:16.840]  Firefox sounds like a cool dog name. It does. It was a little bit like of an identity crisis for my field.
[01:16.840 --> 01:26.040]  I'm going to say Internet Explorer is the worst name for a dog, and I'm going to say Firefox was the best if you were to name your dog after any individual browser.
[01:26.040 --> 01:31.040]  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Netscape would have been, would have been cute.
[01:31.040 --> 01:34.040]  Mm-hmm. Maybe. Was that your watch-pinging?
[01:34.040 --> 01:36.040]  Yes.
[01:36.040 --> 01:43.040]  One of the little details of wearing a watch is that now there's yet another thing to make sure is silent.
[01:43.040 --> 01:47.040]  I know. I'm going to silence it. Maybe I'm not. You know what I'm not going to.
[01:47.040 --> 01:50.040]  Let's just see how many times it goes off. That's right.
[01:50.040 --> 01:55.040]  All right. I actually find, and I guess we're just diving right into it. I found, and I even wrote about this.
[01:55.040 --> 02:00.040]  That the watch works way more naturally to me was sound off. I have sound off.
[02:00.040 --> 02:06.040]  I would say in the, I guess it's been two weeks. Yeah. I guess as we're recording, we've had it for two plus weeks.
[02:06.040 --> 02:12.040]  Two weeks of daily use, I think I've had sound off 90% of the time.
[02:12.040 --> 02:19.040]  Actually, it's funny because I usually, like when I put it in Do Not Disturb motor or silent mode, I forget about it.
[02:19.040 --> 02:25.040]  And then when I'm like, you know, I haven't heard the sound in a while. I turn it back on.
[02:25.040 --> 02:30.040]  But when you say sound off, you just have the tap deck. Yes.
[02:30.040 --> 02:36.040]  So I'm still getting the alerts. It's just the noises for them that I don't have on.
[02:36.040 --> 02:42.040]  Yeah. You know what? I haven't had that on that much either, to be honest, because if I'm in meetings or stuff, I turn that off.
[02:42.040 --> 02:48.040]  And it's not just about interrupting people. To me, it's, I don't know if somehow in my mind, it just feels right.
[02:48.040 --> 02:53.040]  It feels right that the watch is tapping me to say, Hey, I've got something, sound to me.
[02:53.040 --> 03:00.040]  It's like, I had that with my phone. I don't know. It doesn't, it, it just doesn't seem right to me that my, that my watch is making noise.
[03:00.040 --> 03:06.040]  The only sound I have on my phone is for my email or I message pretty much everything.
[03:06.040 --> 03:13.040]  But on the other hand, I do think, and I'm on the fence about this. I can't quite tell.
[03:13.040 --> 03:18.040]  Like I kind of thing, and this is one of the things that I even two weeks in, I can't quite make up my mind.
[03:18.040 --> 03:23.040]  I kind of feel like I want the tap deck engine to be a little bit stronger.
[03:23.040 --> 03:24.040]  Really?
[03:24.040 --> 03:29.040]  Just a little. And it just seems like every once in a while, I miss one.
[03:29.040 --> 03:33.040]  You miss one. I've had that too. I've definitely had that where I miss one.
[03:33.040 --> 03:37.040]  But sometimes I feel like maybe it's because my, my millenaze loop is a little bit loose.
[03:37.040 --> 03:40.040]  My loop is loose. Sounds bad. Sounds really bad.
[03:40.040 --> 03:45.040]  With the millenese though, you can, it's just a, it's just a question of how comfortable it is though.
[03:45.040 --> 03:48.040]  If you wanted it tighter, you could just tighten it a little bit.
[03:48.040 --> 03:54.040]  Oh yeah. Yeah. I find it so comfortable. I mean, I cannot overestimate how comfortable this thing is.
[03:54.040 --> 03:59.040]  Yeah. I, it seems comfortable. I did not get to spend time with it. I wasn't sure what they were going to do.
[03:59.040 --> 04:01.040]  And I feel like, which one are you wearing again?
[04:01.040 --> 04:04.040]  I'm wearing the link bracelet again, about 90% of the time.
[04:04.040 --> 04:07.040]  But I have, I think everybody got the white sport band.
[04:07.040 --> 04:11.040]  Oh, no, no, I have the, oh, you did get blue. I forgot. I saw a member from your video.
[04:11.040 --> 04:13.040]  Did you ask for that? Yeah.
[04:13.040 --> 04:15.040]  Or did they just gave it to you?
[04:15.040 --> 04:18.040]  I'm a little inside baseball. I didn't ask for that one.
[04:18.040 --> 04:24.040]  But I think they didn't, they didn't even, I wasn't even offered a choice of sport band.
[04:24.040 --> 04:27.040]  They just gave me a white. Yeah, I asked for black.
[04:27.040 --> 04:30.040]  And then they didn't have the black when they came to New York.
[04:30.040 --> 04:34.040]  And so they're going to get me this swapped out the black, but actually that's the one I'm an order.
[04:34.040 --> 04:43.040]  So, yeah. And I've heard from people, I have not done the, because we're, you and I are spoiled and we've already got review units.
[04:43.040 --> 04:47.040]  I have not done the thing where I've gone to a store and tried on the watches.
[04:47.040 --> 04:48.040]  Me either.
[04:48.040 --> 04:58.040]  But I have heard from people who have who, a bunch of them seem to say that the various sport bands feel subtly different from each other.
[04:58.040 --> 05:02.040]  That black is even more subtle than white.
[05:02.040 --> 05:08.040]  Not that they're radically different, but that they're different enough that they feel confident that like with their eyes closed they could tell which was which.
[05:08.040 --> 05:13.040]  Right. Well, I have this problem with the sport band and I, you know, it's a small problem.
[05:13.040 --> 05:18.040]  So I didn't really talk about it much or you kind of see it in that video when I'm having a hard time putting it on.
[05:18.040 --> 05:24.040]  Where the, you know, they have the small medium band in the, in the same one and then they have the medium large bands.
[05:24.040 --> 05:25.040]  Yes.
[05:25.040 --> 05:32.040]  And the medium large band is a little bit too big, like the last one, the last, what's a hole?
[05:32.040 --> 05:35.040]  There's probably a professional word for that hole.
[05:35.040 --> 05:39.040]  Anyway, the, on that one, it gets a little bit too big.
[05:39.040 --> 05:45.040]  So I have to use the smaller band, which makes it much harder to put on, but it fits much nicer when I have it on.
[05:45.040 --> 05:52.040]  And for what I found, you know, I always change into that for, for working out and that fit is so important when you're working out.
[05:52.040 --> 06:01.040]  Yeah. Because I found, you know, I did a couple of workout classes with the millenaze, went on a run and I really did not find as accurate heart rate tracking.
[06:01.040 --> 06:04.040]  And then when I switch it for that sport band, it's far more accurate.
[06:04.040 --> 06:09.040]  The problem is it takes me forever to put it on because it's a little bit too small.
[06:09.040 --> 06:11.040]  But when I finally get it on my wrist, it fits perfectly.
[06:11.040 --> 06:12.040]  I see what you mean.
[06:12.040 --> 06:15.040]  I read that in a review and that was one of the things I want to talk about.
[06:15.040 --> 06:18.040]  Now I understand why you found it a little harder to get on.
[06:18.040 --> 06:29.040]  In other words, when you put the smaller, just to step back up, I know there's been a lot of confusion on this because I just from people who read the site and emailing me and twittering, tweeting me.
[06:29.040 --> 06:37.040]  When it says that you get two straps with your Apple watch sport, what they mean is you get two sizes.
[06:37.040 --> 06:42.040]  And that's true whether you get 38 or 42.
[06:42.040 --> 06:51.040]  So you actually get three pieces, the top piece is the same, the one that actually has the slot that the other piece tucks under and it has the pin.
[06:51.040 --> 06:57.040]  And then you get two bottom pieces, the piece with the holes that you pop the pin into.
[06:57.040 --> 06:59.040]  One is smaller, one is larger.
[06:59.040 --> 07:00.040]  I see what you're saying.
[07:00.040 --> 07:07.040]  You're saying that the smaller of them, once it's on is a better feel, but because there's only a little bit left of it to tuck under.
[07:07.040 --> 07:08.040]  Right.
[07:08.040 --> 07:19.040]  I actually wonder, like, is that really meant for kids, like who has that small of a wrist for the really, when you get it on like the closest in strap the small.
[07:19.040 --> 07:21.040]  I don't have it, it's on the other side of the room.
[07:21.040 --> 07:25.040]  And I'm afraid I'll wake up the puppy if I go get it.
[07:25.040 --> 07:27.040]  It's really small.
[07:27.040 --> 07:28.040]  Yeah.
[07:28.040 --> 07:34.040]  I assume I wonder if the bands are the same size, they must be, right?
[07:34.040 --> 07:38.040]  The bands must be the same size, whether you got the 38 or the 42.
[07:38.040 --> 07:50.040]  No, I think that the 42 is probably bigger because the 42, no, I think that the big one on the 42 is just humongous.
[07:50.040 --> 08:01.040]  It's almost, I would guess that there are very few men on the planet for whom the larger of the 42 is still not big enough.
[08:01.040 --> 08:04.040]  It is truly, truly, it's like putting a belt on my wrist.
[08:04.040 --> 08:05.040]  So the small one.
[08:05.040 --> 08:11.040]  Actually, for me with the 42, and you know, I'm six foot two, I mean, I'm not, my wrist aren't particularly large.
[08:11.040 --> 08:15.040]  I think they're, you know, for someone as tall as I am, they're probably a little bit on the small side.
[08:15.040 --> 08:24.040]  But the smaller one, I use the smaller one with the 42 and I'm only like three holes into it.
[08:24.040 --> 08:29.040]  The smaller one with the, oh, like I actually have five five or I think they're seven holes.
[08:29.040 --> 08:33.040]  So it's, I'm not even halfway on the smaller one.
[08:33.040 --> 08:36.040]  It's actually, they're very, the 42s are very large.
[08:36.040 --> 08:39.040]  And I definitely, I definitely, that would make sense.
[08:39.040 --> 08:43.040]  And I definitely think that the 38 small one is definitely meant to range down to kid sizes.
[08:43.040 --> 08:48.040]  Because we've done the thing where, you know, Apple has the, here's what your, you know,
[08:48.040 --> 08:51.040]  measure your wrist and millimeters and here's the ranges.
[08:51.040 --> 08:56.040]  And for Jonas, who's only 11 and is, you know, pretty slight for an 11 year old boy,
[08:56.040 --> 08:59.040]  he easily is within the range.
[08:59.040 --> 09:04.040]  Like it's not even, you know, he might even have like a lower two to spare.
[09:04.040 --> 09:05.040]  Is he getting one?
[09:05.040 --> 09:06.040]  He wants one.
[09:06.040 --> 09:12.040]  I think there's some question over report card grades and motivating that,
[09:12.040 --> 09:15.040]  but he desperately wants one.
[09:15.040 --> 09:17.040]  Oh, man.
[09:17.040 --> 09:21.040]  I'm trying to think of what I used to work for when I was younger.
[09:21.040 --> 09:23.040]  I think money.
[09:23.040 --> 09:26.040]  It's our sports, I worked for like sports stuff.
[09:26.040 --> 09:28.040]  He might not shock people.
[09:28.040 --> 09:29.040]  I was a huge tomboy.
[09:29.040 --> 09:31.040]  So it would be like if I could get a new,
[09:31.040 --> 09:34.040]  like at one time really wanted a new basketball hoop or something like that.
[09:34.040 --> 09:40.040]  Or like a, you know, upgrade from a crappy rubber basketball to a nice synthetic leather.
[09:40.040 --> 09:41.040]  Right.
[09:41.040 --> 09:42.040]  Right.
[09:42.040 --> 09:44.040]  That was always my problem growing up playing basketball.
[09:44.040 --> 09:49.040]  If I ever needed a new one, I wanted the, you know, $45 synthetic leather spalding.
[09:49.040 --> 09:54.040]  And my parents would be like, are you nuts?
[09:54.040 --> 09:55.040]  Here's a $17 basketball.
[09:55.040 --> 09:57.040]  I'd be like, but it's made out of rubber.
[09:57.040 --> 09:58.040]  Yeah.
[09:58.040 --> 10:00.040]  And now the kids work for Apple watches.
[10:00.040 --> 10:01.040]  That's cute.
[10:01.040 --> 10:02.040]  He desperately.
[10:02.040 --> 10:03.040]  But I do wonder.
[10:03.040 --> 10:06.040]  I wonder like who that's really useful for.
[10:06.040 --> 10:10.040]  Like for, I mean, for kids, I wonder what the use case is going to be for them.
[10:10.040 --> 10:12.040]  Well, we can get into that.
[10:12.040 --> 10:15.040]  But I'm, again, it's speculative in it.
[10:15.040 --> 10:22.040]  Certainly, and there's, you know, clearly socio-economic implications of the idea of a school
[10:22.040 --> 10:26.040]  where a bunch of the kids have $400 Apple watches.
[10:26.040 --> 10:32.040]  But in that world, I think that the communication stuff is going to be huge.
[10:32.040 --> 10:33.040]  Right.
[10:33.040 --> 10:36.040]  Because they have, well, I think it's, how would you say you?
[10:36.040 --> 10:37.040]  He's 11.
[10:37.040 --> 10:38.040]  11.
[10:38.040 --> 10:39.040]  Yeah.
[10:39.040 --> 10:44.040]  I mean, you're not in, they have all these kitty, like smart watches, I guess.
[10:44.040 --> 10:45.040]  I guess that's what they're called.
[10:45.040 --> 10:49.040]  But you know, they are sort of the trackers that have the built-in GPS and stuff like that.
[10:49.040 --> 10:56.040]  I mean, it seems like that's probably not the right age range for something like this.
[10:56.040 --> 11:01.040]  And in terms of communication, obviously it would be great for parents, right?
[11:01.040 --> 11:06.040]  Keeping tabs on their kids, making sure they see alerts or something like that.
[11:06.040 --> 11:10.040]  But I don't know if it spans into that tracking type of thing.
[11:10.040 --> 11:15.040]  Yeah, no more so than having a phone.
[11:15.040 --> 11:17.040]  Having a phone, right?
[11:17.040 --> 11:19.040]  But that's, you know, and he's in fifth grade.
[11:19.040 --> 11:25.040]  I can't even imagine what it's like with the girls who are clearly more advanced socially than the boys.
[11:25.040 --> 11:26.040]  Right.
[11:26.040 --> 11:31.040]  But even with his friends, there's, the texting is really taken off this year.
[11:31.040 --> 11:36.040]  Like fifth grade seems to be where the boys in his class really taken off with the texting.
[11:36.040 --> 11:43.040]  And I don't even pay attention to it. My wife does just to make sure it's, you know, nothing inappropriate or whatever.
[11:43.040 --> 11:45.040]  But it just seems inscrutable.
[11:45.040 --> 11:46.040]  It's like gibberish.
[11:46.040 --> 11:49.040]  It's like, it's like a foreign language.
[11:49.040 --> 11:52.040]  Well, that brings me to the best part of your review.
[11:52.040 --> 11:53.040]  Your review is great.
[11:53.040 --> 11:57.040]  But I have to say the best part of your review is your, your teen romance at the end.
[11:57.040 --> 12:02.040]  Which is also the part that got the most like, are you freaking serious?
[12:02.040 --> 12:04.040]  This is a bunch of crap.
[12:04.040 --> 12:09.040]  You know, you either can see, you can either foresee your either type of person who can see that scenario or you're not.
[12:09.040 --> 12:17.040]  And the people who cannot see it think that I'm, you know, that I, you know, I don't know, drank too much rose wine or whatever when I wrote that part.
[12:17.040 --> 12:20.040]  But I meant it seriously. I really did.
[12:20.040 --> 12:28.040]  I mean, I think if, if anything, I mean, do you think years ago we could have first seen us communicating at all with emoji?
[12:28.040 --> 12:29.040]  No.
[12:29.040 --> 12:40.040]  I mean, right? Like that, I mean, as crazy as, as some of those graphs sounded and as crazy as some of these like emoticons that they put on here and as much as I sort of made fun of them a little bit.
[12:40.040 --> 12:42.040]  You just really don't know.
[12:42.040 --> 12:53.040]  And like, I think it would have sounded crazy to us a number of years ago that like, we would all be texting in emojis and sometimes complete sentences in them and people understand that.
[12:53.040 --> 13:11.040]  But that idea is, is kind of crazy and I certainly think that visual way of communicating with each other, whether it's photos or creepy mime hands or creepy heart rates could certainly be way bigger than we actually think it might be.
[13:11.040 --> 13:24.040]  But I think you were totally right to say that it might appeal to a younger demographic or it just might turn into something that like becomes this language amongst a different sort of generation.
[13:24.040 --> 13:26.040]  Maybe, maybe just shows how old we are.
[13:26.040 --> 13:30.040]  Yeah, that's exactly the sort of thing I was trying to get at and I believe it.
[13:30.040 --> 13:31.040]  So this is a true story.
[13:31.040 --> 13:45.040]  My wife and I grew up together. We were literally in the same kindergarten class. And in high school at one point where we would, one way we would more or less flirt with each other is we just had a system.
[13:45.040 --> 14:00.040]  We had the same math classes and we had a system where I would, I had like a, I think it was a Casio, but it was the type of type of calculator that someone in AP calculus in 1989 or 90 would have had a whole bunch of buttons and
[14:00.040 --> 14:04.040]  had memory and had a way to like actually put like characters in there.
[14:04.040 --> 14:13.040]  So we had like this complicated system of letters and numbers to make, you know, to make notes and it was incredibly cryptic.
[14:13.040 --> 14:17.040]  But then we would just swap calculators and we'd have notes for each other.
[14:17.040 --> 14:23.040]  And it was super, you know, it wasn't, you couldn't actually type it didn't have a disease so you had to skip certain things.
[14:23.040 --> 14:24.040]  Right.
[14:24.040 --> 14:32.040]  But it felt like it was foolproof because anybody, you know, like if a teacher caught us all it looked like as we were swapping calculators.
[14:32.040 --> 14:36.040]  And even if they saw what was on the screen, they wouldn't be able to understand it.
[14:36.040 --> 14:38.040]  And what grade were you guys in?
[14:38.040 --> 14:41.040]  Oh my God, this must be like 11th and 12th grade.
[14:41.040 --> 14:43.040]  Oh my God. That's amazing.
[14:43.040 --> 14:53.040]  We talked about it in years, but we talked about it in the context of Apple Watch and, you know, what we would have done if we had Apple watches when we were in 11th.
[14:53.040 --> 14:55.040]  And 12th grade.
[14:55.040 --> 14:56.040]  Right.
[14:56.040 --> 14:57.040]  Right.
[14:57.040 --> 14:58.040]  Huh.
[14:58.040 --> 15:01.040]  I mean, it's also, it's that sort of slide.
[15:01.040 --> 15:02.040]  Is that three?
[15:02.040 --> 15:03.040]  I'll get a count.
[15:03.040 --> 15:04.040]  I think that's three.
[15:04.040 --> 15:05.040]  Is it three?
[15:05.040 --> 15:06.040]  Let me see here.
[15:06.040 --> 15:07.040]  Oh, yes.
[15:07.040 --> 15:09.040]  My editor trying to get me on the phone right now.
[15:09.040 --> 15:10.040]  Sorry.
[15:10.040 --> 15:12.040]  I have need to pause this podcast right now.
[15:12.040 --> 15:13.040]  That's fine.
[15:13.040 --> 15:15.040]  No, I don't.
[15:15.040 --> 15:16.040]  I don't really do.
[15:16.040 --> 15:17.040]  If you did, you'd have been fine.
[15:17.040 --> 15:20.040]  Um, wait, does that mean?
[15:20.040 --> 15:21.040]  That was me.
[15:21.040 --> 15:22.040]  That was me.
[15:22.040 --> 15:23.040]  I got another one just pop.
[15:23.040 --> 15:24.040]  That wasn't you.
[15:24.040 --> 15:26.040]  No, I'm not silent.
[15:26.040 --> 15:27.040]  Because I have my headphones on too.
[15:27.040 --> 15:32.040]  So if I'm hearing them, I think I'm hearing them through my mic.
[15:32.040 --> 15:34.040]  Um, yeah, I'm keeping this on.
[15:34.040 --> 15:35.040]  I think this is great.
[15:35.040 --> 15:38.040]  People can get a real idea of how many alerts I get.
[15:38.040 --> 15:40.040]  Um, yeah, back to your right.
[15:40.040 --> 15:41.040]  That's an amazing story.
[15:41.040 --> 15:49.040]  I mean, yeah, I think like there's also this, this idea of like sort of slightly communicating with someone when nobody else knows, right?
[15:49.040 --> 15:58.040]  And so, um, like you were describing with the calculator or someone who's, uh, you know, in a movie theater or something like that, uh, it could be, it could certainly be interesting.
[15:58.040 --> 16:06.040]  I think, um, yeah, I mean, I, I made some sarcastic comments about the, the certain emojis, but they're, they're definitely fun.
[16:06.040 --> 16:10.040]  There is a, there's a bootstrapping issue with it.
[16:10.040 --> 16:18.040]  And it, whether it's teenagers or whatever, which is that these, the most innovative ways to communicate the drawings, the taps,
[16:18.040 --> 16:21.040]  the smart beats are only watched to watch.
[16:21.040 --> 16:27.040]  And so the bootstrapping issue is it only works if the person you want to send these to also has a watch.
[16:27.040 --> 16:28.040]  And it's weird.
[16:28.040 --> 16:37.040]  And so a bunch of people wrote to me after my review came up and they said, you know, for this particular case, I'm surprised Apple didn't give you two so that you could have your
[16:37.040 --> 16:51.040]  opinion and you could try these things out. And they're like, so how did you try those things? And the answer is we like we're sending taps and stuff to people at Apple, Apple prep, you know, PR people and product marketing people.
[16:51.040 --> 17:03.040]  I did not, I, I, I will say this, I found it weird enough that I didn't want to send my heartbeat to anybody because it felt, I don't know, it just was like a little, I don't know, just didn't feel right.
[17:03.040 --> 17:11.040]  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've been sending my heart rate to, that my heartbeat to new like a towel for like two weeks now and I think it's really brought us closer together.
[17:11.040 --> 17:15.040]  That should have sent mine to my two. That's what I should have done. Yeah.
[17:15.040 --> 17:23.040]  I think we are really, we've gotten to know each other on another level. So, I sent taps to you and you ignored me.
[17:23.040 --> 17:29.040]  Did you not get them? Did you miss my taps? Man. This is like the greatest diss now of the,
[17:29.040 --> 17:37.040]  say I just ignored your taps. Get out of my face taps. I don't think I knew they were from me.
[17:37.040 --> 17:41.040]  Oh, maybe they came from like a weird phone number. Maybe it was my phone number now.
[17:41.040 --> 17:45.040]  I mean, I do like, what, what's your area? Uh, two, six, seven.
[17:45.040 --> 17:49.040]  I don't think I got that. Yeah, because that's one thing about them.
[17:49.040 --> 17:55.040]  The, the, the other thing about all three of the watch specific communications, the doodles,
[17:55.040 --> 18:01.040]  the taps, the heartbeats, is they are ephemeral. And, right.
[18:01.040 --> 18:07.040]  You, so another, there's, there is no record of them. There's no way to go back and replay them.
[18:07.040 --> 18:12.040]  So there's a sort of snap chattiness ephemeral quality to them.
[18:12.040 --> 18:16.040]  There is no record of them, you know, so. Well, they show up in your notifications.
[18:16.040 --> 18:20.040]  Like you can go access them after the fact. Yeah, but then once you play it, it's gone.
[18:20.040 --> 18:25.040]  Yeah, when it's, wait, right, it's gone. But I don't even think I got that from you.
[18:25.040 --> 18:30.040]  Yeah. Did you, did you doodle or you just, I just sent you some taps. I'll send you some taps right now.
[18:30.040 --> 18:35.040]  Send me some taps. Yeah. I don't, I don't think I even have your cell phone number.
[18:35.040 --> 18:39.040]  I guess you don't, you do need it. Yeah. You need iCloud, right? Yes.
[18:39.040 --> 18:43.040]  I also sort of broke my digital crown. Really? How?
[18:43.040 --> 18:52.040]  I, you know, in that scene in the video when I got some toothpaste. Oh, up taps, tapped you, tapped you.
[18:52.040 --> 18:56.040]  There we go. Blue taps, blue taps. Yeah, that's me.
[18:56.040 --> 19:02.040]  I'm Mr. Blue taps. I'm going to add. I'm not going to block. I'm going to add.
[19:02.040 --> 19:04.040]  Okay.
[19:04.040 --> 19:08.040]  Also, like, what can you really risk realistically doodle on this screen?
[19:08.040 --> 19:14.040]  Other than, like, high and a flower or a heart or a, I don't know.
[19:14.040 --> 19:18.040]  I'm not going to say what I would have done if I, when I was a teenager, but,
[19:18.040 --> 19:20.040]  but I would. Yeah.
[19:20.040 --> 19:21.040]  Right. Right.
[19:21.040 --> 19:25.040]  It's funny though. See, I guess I didn't have your phone number, but now they're sending it as,
[19:25.040 --> 19:30.040]  right. And there he is. Joanna sent me a green high.
[19:30.040 --> 19:34.040]  Yeah. So I should add, but I got to add it to your.
[19:34.040 --> 19:39.040]  I think really, people really appreciate this conversation right now.
[19:39.040 --> 19:44.040]  Well, I don't know. I think that it's.
[19:44.040 --> 19:51.040]  It's, I don't know what it is. It is, makes for a weird podcast, but I feel like it's very hard to,
[19:51.040 --> 19:55.040]  it's hard to, it's really hard to write about and maybe it's easier to talk about.
[19:55.040 --> 20:01.040]  Right. If you're quiet enough, maybe everyone can hear my heartbeat. Right.
[20:01.040 --> 20:06.040]  I don't know, but I feel we're close enough, John, that I could send you my heartbeat right now.
[20:06.040 --> 20:09.040]  Sure. Well, I got to say if you feel that way, I do have it.
[20:09.040 --> 20:14.040]  Well, see, if you feel that way to return that, and I won't understand if you don't,
[20:14.040 --> 20:18.040]  but I won't really.
[20:18.040 --> 20:23.040]  Oh, I get seen now. I gave, see, this is where I sort of, I still get mixed up.
[20:23.040 --> 20:26.040]  I gave it a force tap and it wanted me to.
[20:26.040 --> 20:33.040]  Yeah, no, I mean, it's not, it's, it's, I have had a lot hard time getting it to catch my heartbeat when I do that.
[20:33.040 --> 20:36.040]  Cause it's not like, also I have the smaller screen.
[20:36.040 --> 20:41.040]  So I'm putting two fingers on the screen, which basically takes up the whole screen.
[20:41.040 --> 20:49.040]  Oh, he did it, everybody. He sent me his heartbeat.
[20:49.040 --> 20:52.040]  I don't know if you can hear it.
[20:52.040 --> 20:55.040]  No, I think it's hard to hear. Well, we had to like,
[20:55.040 --> 21:00.040]  when we filmed the video, we stuck the mic and it actually got it, but that,
[21:00.040 --> 21:04.040]  that to me, though, I'm telling you that to me is, is one that's going to work.
[21:04.040 --> 21:07.040]  I think that people, I think people are going to use it.
[21:07.040 --> 21:08.040]  Yeah, probably.
[21:08.040 --> 21:10.040]  It's just a way of saying, hey, I'm thinking about you.
[21:10.040 --> 21:16.040]  Right, right. Oh, certainly if it's, if it's someone close to you.
[21:16.040 --> 21:17.040]  Right.
[21:17.040 --> 21:23.040]  But I think, I think there's, that's like a something that I didn't get to talk about in my review and something I've been thinking about,
[21:23.040 --> 21:27.040]  like, as more and more people wear these, sort of like the iPhone, right?
[21:27.040 --> 21:31.040]  Like the iPhone became a really powerful tool as more and more people got them, right?
[21:31.040 --> 21:34.040]  Not only because more apps came out, but even just in terms of communicating,
[21:34.040 --> 21:37.040]  I message was one thing I think, like to me,
[21:37.040 --> 21:41.040]  I message is just such a huge part of my life, even though I don't really think about it.
[21:41.040 --> 21:46.040]  But it's part of the thing that sort of, that's how I communicate with everyone all day long.
[21:46.040 --> 21:48.040]  My colleagues, my friends, my family.
[21:48.040 --> 21:51.040]  And this seems sort of thing with the watch, right?
[21:51.040 --> 21:54.040]  Like, if more and more people have this, there might be,
[21:54.040 --> 21:59.040]  they're going to become these ways where we can connect to those other people that have them.
[21:59.040 --> 22:03.040]  And actually one thing I've been thinking about and, you know, I wrote this piece a couple, like a year ago,
[22:03.040 --> 22:06.040]  a year ago now, about business cards.
[22:06.040 --> 22:10.040]  And like, I want there to be some easy way where if you see another person with an Apple Watch,
[22:10.040 --> 22:16.040]  you can easily sort of transmit information or their contact information, like a handshake.
[22:16.040 --> 22:19.040]  Do you know what I've been saying about this for years,
[22:19.040 --> 22:24.040]  ever since the iPhone came out, like one of the weird things about the iPhone is that there's nothing like that.
[22:24.040 --> 22:26.040]  And the Newton had it.
[22:26.040 --> 22:30.040]  And I know people mock the Newton, but the Newton had a thing where if you met somebody else who had a Newton,
[22:30.040 --> 22:33.040]  all you had to do was point your IR ports at each other.
[22:33.040 --> 22:37.040]  And it was like two taps away and you'd exchange contact cards.
[22:37.040 --> 22:41.040]  And it was, you know, say what you want about the Newton,
[22:41.040 --> 22:43.040]  it was one of the things that worked great.
[22:43.040 --> 22:44.040]  And it seemed like something.
[22:44.040 --> 22:45.040]  I love the idea.
[22:45.040 --> 22:47.040]  It's pointing your IR ports together.
[22:47.040 --> 22:50.040]  It seemed like something you should be able to do and you could do it and it worked.
[22:50.040 --> 22:53.040]  And yet here we are in 2015 and you still can't do it with,
[22:53.040 --> 22:56.040]  even if you both have iPhones, let alone some way to do it,
[22:56.040 --> 22:58.040]  where it would work with anybody's phone.
[22:58.040 --> 23:03.040]  And that was one of the things I said about the iPhone 6 when it came out with NFC was,
[23:03.040 --> 23:09.040]  okay, it's great for payments, but kind of wish there were more things you could do when you put this in contact with another phone.
[23:09.040 --> 23:14.040]  And obviously, Android's done some things with, you know, their beam and no one really uses that,
[23:14.040 --> 23:21.040]  but it seems like, you know, especially with Apple products and iPhones, like there is this sort of community around using the same thing.
[23:21.040 --> 23:28.040]  It just seems like I would love it if I could shake someone's hand and we could exchange contact info.
[23:28.040 --> 23:32.040]  I'd also like see so much potential in the social realm for this.
[23:32.040 --> 23:38.040]  Like as much as I see it as being a social norm disruptor and I have a lot of thoughts about that.
[23:38.040 --> 23:47.040]  But I think, like for me, I also want some sort of app that like I go to a party or I go to a meeting and it tells me who that person is.
[23:47.040 --> 23:55.040]  Again, lots of privacy concerns about that, but like, I would love it if I'm at CES or some conference and someone comes up to me.
[23:55.040 --> 24:04.040]  It's so great to see you. That person's wearing an Apple watch. I'm wearing an Apple watch. Couldn't it say, oh, yeah, that's John Gruber.
[24:04.040 --> 24:11.040]  Right. It seems like, I mean, there's a lot of privacy concerns, but it's just like one thing that I could really use in my life.
[24:11.040 --> 24:22.040]  Yeah, I don't know. There could be some kind of way where it would be sort of like air drop where with air drop you can say contact only or you can say everyone.
[24:22.040 --> 24:37.040]  And then if you were in a situation like, you know, like a cocktail party or some kind of, you know, you're at a conference or a post event press thing and you're mingling.
[24:37.040 --> 24:51.040]  But you know, you want to meet people. You could set, you could change it to, you know, open to anybody and then turn it off or it could even be like the sort of thing where it would say like, hey, for how long, like maybe for the next two hours and then go back to being context only.
[24:51.040 --> 25:04.040]  It seems like it's, you know, like air drop shows how you can kind of solve that sort of issue though, where you know, you may not want to be open to the general public all the time, but temporarily you might want to be.
[25:04.040 --> 25:12.040]  Actually at the Apple watch launch event, the one in March. I forget, like here, I forget his name.
[25:12.040 --> 25:25.040]  Somebody, somebody air dropped me a photo of them playing with the new MacBook. And it just like showed up because I guess I had my thing on everyone and I didn't think about it. I accepted it.
[25:25.040 --> 25:33.040]  Like it's that like someone so wants to air drop you a photo and I accepted it. And it was, it was fun. I mean, some ways I could see like I didn't really know what I was going to get before I opened it.
[25:33.040 --> 25:47.040]  So yeah, but it's, it's definitely fun. Let me, those are my deep thoughts on that. Let me, let me take a break at this point. I didn't think the shows first sponsor and enter good friends at fracture.
[25:47.040 --> 25:58.040]  You guys know fracture. You go to website fracture me.com and they take your photos and print them on glass. So here's what I want you to do go this do this.
[25:58.040 --> 26:06.040]  I keep saying that they've sponsored the show all quarter long. And people keep signing up, but I don't understand why people haven't already done it.
[26:06.040 --> 26:19.040]  Go through your phone, find your best picture from the last month and send it to fracture, get it printed out and hang it up on your wall and see just how nice it is to have your pictures in the real world off these digital devices.
[26:19.040 --> 26:31.040]  It's so great. And I think that ever since I've been using fracture, it really has reminded me of how much I like having my pictures in analog form.
[26:31.040 --> 26:43.040]  Back when our son was born, I just said earlier in the show, he's 11. I was still shooting film 10 years ago. I didn't really switch over to digital photography until like 2006 or so.
[26:43.040 --> 26:55.040]  And we were just looking through a photo album of actual prints of photos from like 10 years ago. And it's just an amazing thing. It has a different feel to it.
[26:55.040 --> 27:07.040]  So fracture, they print your photos directly on glass. Not a piece of paper stuck to glass. I don't know what they do. They've got some kind of magical machine that prints photos on glass.
[27:07.040 --> 27:20.040]  And so you end up with an analog photo, a piece of glass you can hang on the wall, you can put on your desk. That's just the glass with the photo on it, like the way the retina screens are laminated to your devices.
[27:20.040 --> 27:38.040]  And it comes in this great cardboard shipping containers that as you take them apart, what's left is all you need to prop it up like an easel on your desk or a shelf, or with the stuff on the back where you can get a hole and have it hang on the wall.
[27:38.040 --> 27:53.040]  And you don't need a frame, you don't need to put a frame around it. It's just border to border, no frame. It just looks great. It's just a perfect photo edge to edge with great quality, super great color reproduction.
[27:53.040 --> 28:14.040]  It's the best analog pronounce of digital photos that I've ever seen. It's as good as you can imagine. Really, really great stuff. So my thanks to them, and here's the deal. If you use the code for the show, it's Daring Fireball, all one word, Daring Fireball. You save 15% off any order, and their prices are already great.
[28:14.040 --> 28:31.040]  And they have all these any size you can imagine from like little three by three squares all the way up to giant 23 by 27-inch rectangles. So go check them out at fractureme.com and print, get one of your photos printed and just see how good it is.
[28:31.040 --> 28:33.040]  I'm doing this right now, by the way.
[28:33.040 --> 28:35.040]  Don't want your painting.
[28:35.040 --> 28:49.040]  I'm glad I've been joking. I mean, it looks like, okay, I just figured out what I'm getting my mom for Mother's Day. I told my mom that after we got married this year, that pretty much for the next 10 year, she was going to get photos from the wedding.
[28:49.040 --> 28:57.040]  She's like, oh, here's another year, here's another version of the photo that you got last year. It is a surefire Mother's Day gift for any.
[28:57.040 --> 29:05.040]  So this is like a great way. It's like, here's the photo we gave you for your birthday a couple months ago, but now look it's on glass.
[29:05.040 --> 29:09.040]  This is a great, actually. And also, I want to get one for my office.
[29:09.040 --> 29:11.040]  They're really, really great stuff.
[29:11.040 --> 29:15.040]  One of the things that struck me about your review is still talking about the watch, and something that...
[29:15.040 --> 29:16.040]  We're not talking about fracturing.
[29:16.040 --> 29:25.040]  But something that I couldn't test, I know, because I don't know, but how accurate some of the heartbeat like the heartbeat stuff is.
[29:25.040 --> 29:35.040]  And I thought that was really interesting, because you have a dedicated heartbeat monitor that you strap it around your chest, and then you can wear it when you work out.
[29:35.040 --> 29:45.040]  And you've done tests before for the journal, what was your conclusion? It was the closest thing you've seen to the accuracy of an EKG?
[29:45.040 --> 29:56.040]  Yeah, so a couple of months ago I did this huge project, and I'm actually so happy I did it at the time. No one really cared. But now it was actually really looking back on it was something I'm really happy we did.
[29:56.040 --> 30:01.040]  I looked at... It was when the Microsoft band came out, bassist's band had just come out.
[30:01.040 --> 30:09.040]  And it just kept getting these readings where I was like, yeah, I certainly don't think my heart rate is at 120 right now. I was walking to work.
[30:09.040 --> 30:15.040]  And actually at some point it was like, maybe there's something wrong with my heart. So anyway, I had started testing these.
[30:15.040 --> 30:20.040]  And so I went to my general practitioner who actually happens to also be a cardiologist.
[30:20.040 --> 30:27.040]  And she did a whole full heart rate work, a heart work up and turns out I'm perfectly fine, which was very, very good to know.
[30:27.040 --> 30:33.040]  And she also... We also did an EKG where you can sort of, you know, run on the treadmill and have all these electrodes.
[30:33.040 --> 30:39.040]  I don't even know if that's the right term hooked up to your chest and you're back and all over you.
[30:39.040 --> 30:42.040]  I think they're all electrodes. Yeah, I think that sounds about right.
[30:42.040 --> 30:46.040]  Anyway, so she had that right and so that was sort of the constant.
[30:46.040 --> 30:56.040]  And I then also used at the same time compared the Microsoft band, the bassist band, a polar chest rate chest strap monitor.
[30:56.040 --> 31:03.040]  And I believe the Fitbit was the other one that I used. I should pull up this article.
[31:03.040 --> 31:11.040]  And, you know, found that one of the things we found across all of them was that just it took them quite a while to catch up to what the my heart rate actually was.
[31:11.040 --> 31:15.040]  And so that was kind of the problem that I was seeing when I would see these irregularities.
[31:15.040 --> 31:25.040]  You know, if it would say I was at 120 beats per minute, that might have been where I was actually like 10 minutes ago or 20 like, you know, it just wasn't catching up in real time.
[31:25.040 --> 31:31.040]  And so really I, you know, sort of called out these companies for saying just this is unacceptable.
[31:31.040 --> 31:36.040]  Like we shouldn't be, you shouldn't be surfacing information to people that just isn't right.
[31:36.040 --> 31:42.040]  And so the thing that did come the closest to the EKG was a polar chest strap monitor.
[31:42.040 --> 31:48.040]  I'll pull up the actual one right now. It's the H7, which works with their polar loop band.
[31:48.040 --> 31:53.040]  And so that was like really, really, really in line with what I was seeing with the AKG.
[31:53.040 --> 32:03.040]  And so when I was testing the Apple watch, I compared the Apple watch during a cycling class and during a few runs to that same polar chest strap monitor.
[32:03.040 --> 32:08.040]  And found that during during those workouts, it was actually really in line.
[32:08.040 --> 32:13.040]  It was only a couple beats off, you know, usually in the range of five from the polar.
[32:13.040 --> 32:16.040]  And so that was that was really impressive to me.
[32:16.040 --> 32:22.040]  The big thing that Apple says they're doing right is they're, they've got a really good fit with the sport band on.
[32:22.040 --> 32:28.040]  They also say their algorithms are sort of working to flush out things that might not be right.
[32:28.040 --> 32:36.040]  And so that, you know, also when you're working out, it's constantly taking the heart rate versus when you're not working out.
[32:36.040 --> 32:38.040]  It's taking it every 10 minutes.
[32:38.040 --> 32:42.040]  So I definitely did notice at times I looked down and you know, at the glances and see,
[32:42.040 --> 32:46.040]  okay, my heart rate, like for instance right now says 61 beats per minute.
[32:46.040 --> 32:49.040]  You know, that probably seems about right.
[32:49.040 --> 32:52.040]  My resting heart rates around 55 beats per minute.
[32:52.040 --> 32:55.040]  And, but you know, now it's measuring.
[32:55.040 --> 32:59.040]  So it could be off and I'm also, you know, talking quickly now so it could be higher.
[32:59.040 --> 33:03.040]  But yeah, I mean, that was something I wanted to make sure was right.
[33:03.040 --> 33:07.040]  And I think Apple did a really good job of getting that aspect right.
[33:07.040 --> 33:14.040]  Yeah, I think I'm in bad shape because mine's usually around 70 which seems high for resting pulse.
[33:14.040 --> 33:16.040]  I think it's, I think that's okay.
[33:16.040 --> 33:24.040]  I mean, mine fluctuates like throughout the day of normal from sort of being 50 to 80 something, you know.
[33:24.040 --> 33:26.040]  It just depends on your nerves.
[33:26.040 --> 33:28.040]  It depends on if you've walked around.
[33:28.040 --> 33:29.040]  It depends on a lot of things.
[33:29.040 --> 33:30.040]  It just tried it right now.
[33:30.040 --> 33:32.040]  69, 68 just went down.
[33:32.040 --> 33:33.040]  Yeah.
[33:33.040 --> 33:34.040]  So no more relaxing.
[33:34.040 --> 33:35.040]  Right.
[33:35.040 --> 33:36.040]  Yeah.
[33:36.040 --> 33:45.040]  Yeah, I mean, I mean, that was a big thing for me going into this because I have been looking for a device that I can wear all day long and also work out with.
[33:45.040 --> 33:53.040]  And so, yes, you've got to switch this band, which is a little bit annoying, especially given what I talked about with my sport band thing.
[33:53.040 --> 33:57.040]  But that's, I mean, you know, I can't say that's going to affect too many people.
[33:57.040 --> 33:59.040]  And, you know, Apple seems to get around it.
[33:59.040 --> 34:03.040]  My big thing with it is just, it's not doing enough with that data yet.
[34:03.040 --> 34:06.040]  And that's, I think, where the potential of the platform is.
[34:06.040 --> 34:07.040]  We can go there.
[34:07.040 --> 34:09.040]  I think we should talk about it because it's to me.
[34:09.040 --> 34:17.040]  This is the part that I explored the least in my review because I'm not into fitness and combined with that even just little things like with this stupid.
[34:17.040 --> 34:23.040]  I think I've got until I actually in just until yesterday I was restricted from any kind of vigorous workout.
[34:23.040 --> 34:29.040]  Like so all I could do the only thing I was allowed to do is walk, which is one of the activities you can do.
[34:29.040 --> 34:33.040]  And I do realize, you know, whether you're older or, you know, you have other conditions.
[34:33.040 --> 34:37.040]  Maybe, you know, outdoor walk is the most vigorous thing you can do.
[34:37.040 --> 34:46.040]  So it's good that it's on the watch, but it really felt like as a reviewer I was doing very little credit to it as a fitness device by going for a walk.
[34:46.040 --> 34:48.040]  No, I mean, people go for a walk.
[34:48.040 --> 34:50.040]  I know, but I mean, there's more I could have done.
[34:50.040 --> 34:51.040]  I'm looking.
[34:51.040 --> 34:52.040]  Yeah.
[34:52.040 --> 35:00.040]  I do feel I feel like it's not just lip service from Apple that they took it seriously as a fitness device.
[35:00.040 --> 35:06.040]  Like I feel like them billing it as a full one third of their primary use cases for it.
[35:06.040 --> 35:08.040]  They're totally serious about it.
[35:08.040 --> 35:15.040]  Like could that be more serious that it's not just a watch that happens to do some of the fitness stuff haphazardly.
[35:15.040 --> 35:21.040]  Like they are dead serious about dominant, you know, even if the main thing you're looking for is a fitness tracking.
[35:21.040 --> 35:28.040]  As a fitness tracking device, Apple watch is the thing that you should, is something you should consider.
[35:28.040 --> 35:29.040]  Yeah.
[35:29.040 --> 35:32.040]  And I know that's something I shared in my review.
[35:32.040 --> 35:36.040]  You know, I felt when I started tackling this device, like you sort of have to make it your own.
[35:36.040 --> 35:39.040]  And it is very confusing to me at a lot of points.
[35:39.040 --> 35:41.040]  There's so much going on.
[35:41.040 --> 35:48.040]  And one of the things I knew I wanted it to be was a fitness tracker, both as sort of like a everyday fitness tracker throughout my day.
[35:48.040 --> 35:54.040]  But also for these exercise classes that I do a couple of times a week and have gotten really into.
[35:54.040 --> 35:57.040]  So, like, I really wanted to road test it in those.
[35:57.040 --> 35:59.040]  And I felt like, yeah, this thing's great.
[35:59.040 --> 36:01.040]  And that's ultimately why I'm going to buy the sport.
[36:01.040 --> 36:07.040]  Because I actually, again, yesterday went to another class and just loved having it on, loved having sort of a baseline.
[36:07.040 --> 36:14.040]  And knowing now as I collect more and more data where I'm sort of, you know, working hard or not hard.
[36:14.040 --> 36:19.040]  And that's, I mean, that's, again, about the potential. I think there's a lot of Apple could really do with that information.
[36:19.040 --> 36:24.040]  The activity app to me seems like a very, very basic Gen 1 product.
[36:24.040 --> 36:30.040]  And whether Apple decides to use that data or some other third party, there's a lot of potential there.
[36:30.040 --> 36:33.040]  The joys of urban living.
[36:33.040 --> 36:35.040]  Yeah, you like that.
[36:35.040 --> 36:38.040]  I live in a street where the ambulances go by all the time.
[36:38.040 --> 36:41.040]  So the talk show is usually riddled with ambulances.
[36:41.040 --> 36:47.040]  One of the, yeah, well, it's, look, New York, we have not been able to open the windows here for months.
[36:47.040 --> 36:50.040]  And so the window is open and I'm not closing it.
[36:50.040 --> 36:59.040]  But yeah, it's, I mean, yeah, it's happy to say it can actually live a decent life right now in New York without it being freezing cold.
[36:59.040 --> 37:07.040]  Yeah, we open our windows like with the temperature where like people in California would, would be like wearing coats.
[37:07.040 --> 37:09.040]  Right, right.
[37:09.040 --> 37:12.040]  So I think some of the interesting stuff that Apple has done.
[37:12.040 --> 37:21.040]  So I know the biggest knock against this, the first Apple watch is the lack of, or from a fitness perspective is the lack of GPS.
[37:21.040 --> 37:27.040]  People who run want GPS tracking people who cycle definitely want GPS tracking.
[37:27.040 --> 37:32.040]  And I have friends who are serious about both things and they use, you know, whatever devices they do use.
[37:32.040 --> 37:36.040]  They do things where they get like a map that shows them exactly where they went at what place.
[37:36.040 --> 37:42.040]  And that's important to them and anything that doesn't have GPS isn't going to replace what they've already got.
[37:42.040 --> 37:47.040]  And that means that they're stuck still carrying their iPhone around with them.
[37:47.040 --> 37:52.040]  And if you're already carrying your iPhone around for your cycling or for your running, then who, what's the point of even having to watch?
[37:52.040 --> 37:54.040]  It doesn't, doesn't make a difference.
[37:54.040 --> 37:55.040]  Well, there's some little things, right?
[37:55.040 --> 38:00.040]  It's going to give you a much, it's going to give you a heartbeat, heartbeat monitoring that you don't get from the phone.
[38:00.040 --> 38:06.040]  But that's definitely a knock, but they've tried to do the way they've explained it.
[38:06.040 --> 38:11.040]  And I don't know how accurate it is, but that if you go for a run with your phone a couple times.
[38:11.040 --> 38:12.040]  Yep.
[38:12.040 --> 38:13.040]  And it knows how tall you are.
[38:13.040 --> 38:15.040]  You've entered in your height and your weight.
[38:15.040 --> 38:17.040]  It kind of gets a sense of your stride.
[38:17.040 --> 38:18.040]  You do a workout.
[38:18.040 --> 38:23.040]  You sound going to go for a run and you do it with your phone and it has GPS.
[38:23.040 --> 38:27.040]  Then you can start doing it without your phone and it extrapolates.
[38:27.040 --> 38:32.040]  It knows, well, we know what, you know, his stride is and we know how tall he is and how much he weighs.
[38:32.040 --> 38:34.040]  And so it makes some guesses.
[38:34.040 --> 38:39.040]  It's still not going to give you a map without GPS, but it's going to give you a much better sense of the distance that you've gone.
[38:39.040 --> 38:40.040]  Yeah.
[38:40.040 --> 38:47.040]  And I found that to be pretty accurate after I'd gone for like last, I mean, the week of testing this thing and all the craziness.
[38:47.040 --> 38:53.040]  I like, it was basically going for like two runs a day plus a spinning class, which was just insane.
[38:53.040 --> 38:59.040]  And I found one of the runs I did, you know, I just sort of knew how long the path was.
[38:59.040 --> 39:10.040]  And so when I just took the watch on the run and this experience I have talked about now in a number of podcasts and talked about in the review, just took the watch for a run.
[39:10.040 --> 39:17.040]  It was very, very close to saying that it was a two mile run, which I knew it pretty much was.
[39:17.040 --> 39:23.040]  And, you know, I just, I thought that experience was great because I had just left with the watch.
[39:23.040 --> 39:28.040]  I preloaded the watch with a playlist, which was a little bit of a clunky experience, but I got it to work.
[39:28.040 --> 39:31.040]  I had Bluetooth head set paired to it.
[39:31.040 --> 39:41.040]  And then I stopped at Whole Foods bought a coffee and water and ran home, which was like, just this really freeing experience because I actually hate having my phone with me when I run.
[39:41.040 --> 39:42.040]  Same here.
[39:42.040 --> 39:49.040]  Yeah, I mean, I've been set at the piece. I was like, what I think the Apple Watch can disrupt like working out as if like what the iPad did.
[39:49.040 --> 39:55.040]  The iPod did when we had to run with disk, you know, like it was we used to have to run with these clunky things.
[39:55.040 --> 39:56.040]  And yes, it's crazy.
[39:56.040 --> 39:58.040]  Like, oh, yeah, we're complaining about a phone.
[39:58.040 --> 40:00.040]  We have to hold or put on our arm, but it is.
[40:00.040 --> 40:02.040]  It's annoying.
[40:02.040 --> 40:04.040]  So yeah, that was like a great experience.
[40:04.040 --> 40:10.040]  I think that a disk man might be the last portable Sony product that I've ever bought.
[40:10.040 --> 40:21.040]  I think, and I remember being so happy with it because it didn't skip that Sony had done this remarkable engineering that you could go running with a spinning CD and it didn't skip, which was amazing at the time.
[40:21.040 --> 40:26.040]  And at those crazy plastic things on the side, you'd like enclose it.
[40:26.040 --> 40:28.040]  I remember reading about it.
[40:28.040 --> 40:30.040]  It was this is pre-daring fireball way, pre-daring.
[40:30.040 --> 40:33.040]  I mean, this must have been late 90s or something, but I remember reading about how they did it.
[40:33.040 --> 40:34.040]  And it was pretty cool.
[40:34.040 --> 40:42.040]  It was a little bit of buffering and a little bit of like shock absorption to keep the thing on, but it was a crazy achievement.
[40:42.040 --> 40:52.040]  But yeah, I mean, even so, even though it didn't skip, it was a crazy large device to have to be saddled with while going for a run.
[40:52.040 --> 40:53.040]  Right.
[40:53.040 --> 40:54.040]  And the phone still feels good.
[40:54.040 --> 40:56.040]  Yeah, I mean, the phone feels that way.
[40:56.040 --> 41:03.040]  I mean, yeah, it does sound like a first world problem for sure, but it's just nice to have both.
[41:03.040 --> 41:12.040]  And like, I mean, also, this is the first time I really started running with the Bluetooth headset that actually stuck in my ears.
[41:12.040 --> 41:15.040]  I've been using these beats, what are they called?
[41:15.040 --> 41:17.040]  I think I got the same ones.
[41:17.040 --> 41:19.040]  Do they have a red cable?
[41:19.040 --> 41:20.040]  They do.
[41:20.040 --> 41:21.040]  They do.
[41:21.040 --> 41:22.040]  They do.
[41:22.040 --> 41:23.040]  I got those.
[41:23.040 --> 41:26.040]  Yeah, I mean, I feel like a little bit of a douche bag when I run with them, but you know.
[41:26.040 --> 41:28.040]  Yeah, you always look like, I mean, there's no way to look good one.
[41:28.040 --> 41:30.040]  Yeah, it always looks like a douche bag here, right?
[41:30.040 --> 41:34.040]  There's nothing you can do to not look stupid when you're running.
[41:34.040 --> 41:35.040]  I mean, you know, right?
[41:35.040 --> 41:38.040]  Everybody's wearing tight clothes and you got something in your ears.
[41:38.040 --> 41:40.040]  No, I got the same one with these beats.
[41:40.040 --> 41:42.040]  The only thing I don't like about them is the latency.
[41:42.040 --> 41:46.040]  But I did the research beforehand and everybody says they all have the latency.
[41:46.040 --> 41:47.040]  Yeah, exactly.
[41:47.040 --> 41:50.040]  I mean, and like the battery life is really good on them.
[41:50.040 --> 41:52.040]  I haven't charged it for like two week, like a week and a half now.
[41:52.040 --> 41:54.040]  I mean, I guess we're into it.
[41:54.040 --> 41:55.040]  I've only five.
[41:55.040 --> 41:56.040]  Five.
[41:56.040 --> 41:58.040]  It's gotta be more than that.
[41:58.040 --> 41:59.040]  Is it?
[41:59.040 --> 42:00.040]  I don't know.
[42:00.040 --> 42:01.040]  It's a fifth one I've heard.
[42:01.040 --> 42:02.040]  Yeah.
[42:02.040 --> 42:08.040]  I mean, so one of my frustrations with notifications is that if I was using mail on my computer,
[42:08.040 --> 42:11.040]  I wouldn't be getting as many.
[42:11.040 --> 42:12.040]  Right?
[42:12.040 --> 42:17.040]  Because if I'm open, if I have mail open on my iPhone, and I'm looking at emails,
[42:17.040 --> 42:20.040]  I don't get them on my phone, on my watch.
[42:20.040 --> 42:24.040]  As I, or at least they don't, they fade to the background, you know?
[42:24.040 --> 42:27.040]  On my laptop, I use Outlook and they don't.
[42:27.040 --> 42:30.040]  Right, because it's not hooked up to the, the.
[42:30.040 --> 42:31.040]  Right.
[42:31.040 --> 42:34.040]  I message whatever.
[42:34.040 --> 42:36.040]  I do think it works.
[42:36.040 --> 42:42.040]  I think that the running with the, or you know, I've gone for walks without the phone and with the bluetooth.
[42:42.040 --> 42:43.040]  And it's freeing.
[42:43.040 --> 42:44.040]  It's definitely freeing.
[42:44.040 --> 42:48.040]  And in addition to that, and again, this is nothing to do with the watch in particular,
[42:48.040 --> 42:51.040]  but it just happened to, you know, it was the thing that was like, well, I've got it to test it.
[42:51.040 --> 42:54.040]  I have to have bluetooth head, you know, earbuds.
[42:54.040 --> 42:56.040]  So I'll buy some finally breakdown and buy some.
[42:56.040 --> 43:03.040]  It would be just as true if I didn't have the watch, but it is, it is as freeing as I expected not to have a cable connecting me to,
[43:03.040 --> 43:05.040]  from my ears to the thing.
[43:05.040 --> 43:10.040]  And while working out, it's, you know, or running or whatever, it's, it's definitely, it, it feels like the future.
[43:10.040 --> 43:15.040]  They've got to get the, somehow somebody's got to invent something to get the latency down there.
[43:15.040 --> 43:16.040]  Yeah.
[43:16.040 --> 43:25.040]  And I mean, I think the GPS thing, not having it in the watch, you know, the Microsoft band has GPS, and that's what kills the battery.
[43:25.040 --> 43:32.040]  You know, already the, the battery life is, it takes a big hit when you're working out with this thing on.
[43:32.040 --> 43:41.040]  Yeah, and it's, to me, it's exactly like analogous to the original iPhone not having 3G, which was, you know, clearly a lot of the,
[43:41.040 --> 43:46.040]  the top flight phones in 2007 were all coming out with 3G and the iPhone didn't.
[43:46.040 --> 43:50.040]  And Apple, you know, it was one of the cases where they were, they just said why.
[43:50.040 --> 43:53.040]  They said, well, you know, it would kill the battery.
[43:53.040 --> 44:01.040]  You know, we don't, we couldn't, we don't, you know, we don't have a way to do it in a way that sustains the battery life we were hoping for yet.
[44:01.040 --> 44:03.040]  So clearly it's going to come.
[44:03.040 --> 44:13.040]  I mean, I would say of all the things people are thinking about for future Apple Watch revisions, GPS, I think it's a sure thing, but it's just a question of battery life.
[44:13.040 --> 44:15.040]  Right.
[44:15.040 --> 44:16.040]  Yeah.
[44:16.040 --> 44:19.040]  So you had, here's another thing from your review that was interesting to me.
[44:19.040 --> 44:23.040]  Is that on the days that you exercised your watch as battery died?
[44:23.040 --> 44:24.040]  Yeah.
[44:24.040 --> 44:25.040]  I thought that was interesting.
[44:25.040 --> 44:28.040]  I didn't have a single day where the watch is battery died.
[44:28.040 --> 44:32.040]  But I have not been working out in any way.
[44:32.040 --> 44:33.040]  Right.
[44:33.040 --> 44:45.040]  So the, so I tried to divide up the testing because I knew the last couple of days would be really not a good indicator of normal life because I'd be shooting video with it so much.
[44:45.040 --> 44:58.040]  But the first, the first three days, I basically made it to the end of the day, you know, within the, I'd say, 15% mark and I was fine by the time I went to bed.
[44:58.040 --> 45:06.040]  But a day I did two workouts, I certainly had, it was, it was pretty much in power reserve mode by 8 p.m.
[45:06.040 --> 45:16.040]  And one of the things I did during my cycling workout was I did keep the screen on for quite a bit of time and so that hit really took a hit on it.
[45:16.040 --> 45:31.040]  The reason I did that was one of the things you talked about in your review, you know, because my, my arms are on the cycling bike and I can't, like, doing a glance at it doesn't turn the screen on.
[45:31.040 --> 45:41.040]  I basically kept the screen on for most of the time. I guess I was most of the time either tapping it or it was just staying on because it knew it was doing something.
[45:41.040 --> 45:47.040]  But yeah, because I like to, I like having an eye on it to see sort of the accuracy of it.
[45:47.040 --> 45:48.040]  Six.
[45:48.040 --> 45:49.040]  But yeah.
[45:49.040 --> 45:50.040]  What?
[45:50.040 --> 45:51.040]  Six.
[45:51.040 --> 45:55.040]  Here's my battery life from the first few days.
[45:55.040 --> 46:03.040]  Tuesday didn't apply because that was when I swapped, I had to swap the first one they gave me out with the second one because the Taptic engine wasn't working.
[46:03.040 --> 46:04.040]  So that doesn't count.
[46:04.040 --> 46:10.040]  Because I finished, I finished the day with like 70%, but I'd gotten a new watch at like three o'clock.
[46:10.040 --> 46:13.040]  Wednesday, 42, Thursday, five.
[46:13.040 --> 46:23.040]  But I was up until four in the morning and that was a day that I had really, really, like, just spent the whole day playing with the watch and I never put it into bed power reserve mode.
[46:23.040 --> 46:26.040]  I don't know if you can set it to do it automatically or not.
[46:26.040 --> 46:35.040]  But the way it's by default is when it gets to 10%, it gives you a tap and a scary warning and it says you're down, you know, your batteries almost out.
[46:35.040 --> 46:36.040]  Do you want to go to power reserve mode?
[46:36.040 --> 46:37.040]  And I said no.
[46:37.040 --> 46:40.040]  And it's still only got to five when I went to sleep.
[46:40.040 --> 46:51.040]  Friday, it was over 50% Saturday, 37% Sunday, which was Easter, which I spent with family, but I used it a lot.
[46:51.040 --> 46:54.040]  I was testing it. So it was down to 27%.
[46:54.040 --> 46:57.040]  Oh, I think I used it for driving directions on Sunday too.
[46:57.040 --> 46:58.040]  All of that.
[46:58.040 --> 47:00.040]  What brightness do you keep it at?
[47:00.040 --> 47:01.040]  I haven't changed the brightness.
[47:01.040 --> 47:02.040]  So it's at the default.
[47:02.040 --> 47:03.040]  It's in the middle.
[47:03.040 --> 47:04.040]  Right.
[47:04.040 --> 47:05.040]  Yeah.
[47:05.040 --> 47:06.040]  Yeah.
[47:06.040 --> 47:08.040]  I mean, now here's the big difference.
[47:08.040 --> 47:09.040]  Yeah.
[47:09.040 --> 47:11.040]  You have a 38 millimeter one and I have a 42.
[47:11.040 --> 47:17.040]  And Apple on their website even says that their listed battery life is for the 38.
[47:17.040 --> 47:24.040]  And then they say in small print at the bottom of the page that the 42 gets longer battery life for the obvious reason.
[47:24.040 --> 47:26.040]  That's really, I had not even heard that before.
[47:26.040 --> 47:27.040]  That's crazy.
[47:27.040 --> 47:28.040]  Yeah.
[47:28.040 --> 47:33.040]  That's crazy because I don't, you know, Jeff Fowler who also reviewed it for the journal.
[47:33.040 --> 47:38.040]  I think he also said the same, you know, last through the day.
[47:38.040 --> 47:46.040]  But yeah, for most days for me that week of testing, I was down for the count around 11 by bedtime, 11 30.
[47:46.040 --> 47:51.040]  And then the days that I had done some working out had died much earlier.
[47:51.040 --> 48:02.040]  And you know, again, that like during that workout period, which for me usually is a 45 minute spin class, which is looking at the heart rate all the time.
[48:02.040 --> 48:04.040]  And I had the screen mostly on.
[48:04.040 --> 48:14.040]  So if you go to Apple Watch's website and go to technology, then it says, so we gave it a battery that lasts up to 18 hours and then there's a footnote.
[48:14.040 --> 48:24.040]  So here's the footnote, testing conducted by Apple in March 2015 using pre production Apple Watch and software paired with an iPhone using pre production software.
[48:24.040 --> 48:36.040]  I think what they mean is it was using iOS 8.3, the phone, battery life varies by use and configuration actual results will vary.
[48:36.040 --> 48:39.040]  Actually, they don't say anything about the 42 here.
[48:39.040 --> 48:44.040]  I read that somewhere, somewhere I read that the 42 gets longer battery life.
[48:44.040 --> 48:54.040]  And it makes sense I think because I think the battery is bigger compared to the 38 than the screen is bigger in terms of needing more energy to light up the screen.
[48:54.040 --> 48:55.040]  Right.
[48:55.040 --> 49:00.040]  Yeah, I mean, even though even on their site, they say, you know, 6.5 hours for workout.
[49:00.040 --> 49:08.040]  Yeah, I mean, it's not abnormal that if you work out more, it's tapping all those sensors, it's going to take a hit.
[49:08.040 --> 49:16.040]  But in short, I found that concerns, pre release concerns that the thing wasn't going to get through the day was not an issue.
[49:16.040 --> 49:18.040]  Yeah, same here.
[49:18.040 --> 49:23.040]  But on the other hand, a lot of people have been asking me, does your phone have worse battery life?
[49:23.040 --> 49:27.040]  And I think I didn't do any kind of testing on that.
[49:27.040 --> 49:33.040]  And I was also, I've been playing with periscope so much in periscope is a battery killer.
[49:33.040 --> 49:39.040]  Really is. I can anecdotally though, I kind of feel like my iPhone has been getting more battery life.
[49:39.040 --> 49:43.040]  But I'm still getting through the day without charging.
[49:43.040 --> 49:49.040]  See, I never really get through the day without charging. I talk on the phone a lot, so I'm not a good person to ask.
[49:49.040 --> 49:52.040]  And are you in Manhattan most weekdays?
[49:52.040 --> 49:59.040]  Yeah, so there you go. I mean, and I've been in New York a couple times the last couple weeks and that's at last week or two.
[49:59.040 --> 50:05.040]  Because I was in New York to get the phone, I mean to get the watch itself.
[50:05.040 --> 50:09.040]  And then I was there over the weekend to see a Yankees game.
[50:09.040 --> 50:15.040]  So I've been in Manhattan as notoriously bad for your battery on your phone,
[50:15.040 --> 50:19.040]  just because you have such a hard time getting a signal in a building's block, etc, etc.
[50:19.040 --> 50:26.040]  Right. Oh, and I'm the word. Like if I'm on a subway, I'm usually like constantly looking for the little pageant service.
[50:26.040 --> 50:29.040]  Yeah, I'm like, okay, right here, right here.
[50:29.040 --> 50:32.040]  Hurry up, right here.
[50:32.040 --> 50:36.040]  Right, yeah, exactly. So, yeah, I talk on the phone a lot.
[50:36.040 --> 50:43.040]  That's why I say like I never make it through the whole day for a charge because if I work from home, I'm on the phone all the time.
[50:43.040 --> 50:46.040]  Yeah, not the best task.
[50:46.040 --> 50:54.040]  Yeah, so it's, but you know, I think if anything, though, that most people can expect to get through the day with their Apple Watch.
[50:54.040 --> 51:02.040]  Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, and especially like, I mean, there's so much you can do to I think make it go longer.
[51:02.040 --> 51:12.040]  It's actually a really good experiment. I should try like how long turning down the brightness, turning on a lot off of a couple of notifications, how long you could go with it.
[51:12.040 --> 51:15.040]  I bet you could get into, you know, a second full day.
[51:15.040 --> 51:18.040]  Maybe. I don't know. It's, you know, but at least it's a day.
[51:18.040 --> 51:24.040]  How, how annoying do you think it is to have to charge it every night?
[51:24.040 --> 51:38.040]  I thought about this. I mean, the question for me is like, what would I, what would it, if it was really serving a purpose at night for me, I think that would be like the big annoyance.
[51:38.040 --> 51:47.040]  Like if I really thought, oh, this was great for sleep tracking or I really loved how it woke me up in the morning with a gentle vibration on my wrist or something like that.
[51:47.040 --> 52:00.040]  But it doesn't do those things. So I don't mind taking it off. I mean, is it annoying to have another charger? Yes. I mean, between this and the MacBook that I was revealing, it's like enough with the chargers already.
[52:00.040 --> 52:03.040]  But yeah, it's not, it's not a huge pain to me.
[52:03.040 --> 52:12.040]  I feel like I almost cheated because when I when I swapped out my, the first one that didn't work for the second one, Apple just said, you if you want to keep the other charger, you can keep the charger.
[52:12.040 --> 52:19.040]  So I have to and I just left it in my bag and I, you know, because I was testing it, it's on my mind.
[52:19.040 --> 52:26.040]  But so when I went to to New York for the weekend, again, I didn't have to even think about getting it from my bedroom and packing it.
[52:26.040 --> 52:27.040]  Right.
[52:27.040 --> 52:37.040]  But I do think most people would want to. I would want to. I'd want one that I keep at my bed and I would want one that I keep in my travel bag so that I don't have to.
[52:37.040 --> 52:49.040]  Yeah, remember like I just keep lightning chargers in my travel bag. So I never ever have to worry that when I leave the house for a trip that I've remembered to pack a charger from my phone.
[52:49.040 --> 52:52.040]  And I feel like I don't want the same thing for the watch.
[52:52.040 --> 53:02.040]  And the other thing I've been thinking about is it comes with a little, the little square five volt AC adapter that the phone comes with.
[53:02.040 --> 53:08.040]  It seems to charge like a mostly empty watch in about an hour and a half to get a full charge.
[53:08.040 --> 53:11.040]  I haven't really timed it like from a completely dead phone.
[53:11.040 --> 53:20.040]  I did. Let me pull up my notes on that. It took me about two hours. Let me pull up my first day. I timed that. It was about two hours.
[53:20.040 --> 53:22.040]  And that was from completely dead.
[53:22.040 --> 53:26.040]  Basically completely dead. Like like power reserve.
[53:26.040 --> 53:31.040]  Actually that day was completely dead. Let's see if I can pull up my notes on that.
[53:31.040 --> 53:40.040]  Well, the thing that occurred to me though is that you have to have an iPhone if you use Apple Watch.
[53:40.040 --> 53:46.040]  They're very explicit about it. It's at the, you know, who knows years from now what you'll be able to do just with the watch.
[53:46.040 --> 53:56.040]  But for now it is, it's not useless. It keeps the time and you can use Apple Pay without the phone being in Bluetooth range.
[53:56.040 --> 54:03.040]  But most of this all certainly all the notifications. Anything that's incoming has to come from an internet connection from your pair of iPhone.
[54:03.040 --> 54:07.040]  So if you're going to go somewhere with your watch you have to have your iPhone with you.
[54:07.040 --> 54:16.040]  So I'm kind of, I kind of wish that they had shipped it with some kind of charger that had two USB ports so that you would only need one thing stuck in the wall.
[54:16.040 --> 54:27.040]  But you could charge both your phone and your watch because as it stands, you know, most of us, it's another device you have to charge every night.
[54:27.040 --> 54:28.040]  I mean most of us.
[54:28.040 --> 54:30.040]  No, this is the same way I feel about the MacBook charger.
[54:30.040 --> 54:36.040]  And here's the thing for me. I've, and I noticed this. I noticed it this weekend again at the hotel we stayed at in New York.
[54:36.040 --> 54:40.040]  On my side of the bed there was one open AC adapter.
[54:40.040 --> 54:50.040]  And so, you know, to plug into things bedside, I needed to like unplug their lamp or unplug the hotels alarm clock or something.
[54:50.040 --> 54:56.040]  Or set up one of the things to charge, you know, away from the bed, away from bedside.
[54:56.040 --> 55:05.040]  Yeah, no, this is exactly how I felt about the MacBook chargers. I could just put one more USB port in here, like, or something.
[55:05.040 --> 55:14.040]  So, I'm not walking around because there's no other ports on the computer. And obviously, I can get the $80 dongle or whatever.
[55:14.040 --> 55:22.040]  But if it just had another port on that charging brick for my iPhone or my Apple watch or my iPad or my iMac, I don't know.
[55:22.040 --> 55:32.040]  Like when you're on a working trip and you have a MacBook, it is to me, it's a very common move, which is just plug in the MacBook, then plug other devices into USB ports on the thing.
[55:32.040 --> 55:35.040]  You know, one thing is in the wall, but you're charging multiple devices.
[55:35.040 --> 55:36.040]  I do that all the time.
[55:36.040 --> 55:40.040]  Yeah, pass through charging or whatever you want to call it.
[55:40.040 --> 55:45.040]  Yeah, right. Yeah, you use it as a charging hub. I mean, yeah.
[55:45.040 --> 55:55.040]  Yeah, I mean, I do kind of wish that little metal piece on the thing that looks like a heart rate monitor, the charging thing.
[55:55.040 --> 56:03.040]  You know, that thing falls off my nightstand a lot. I knew like, but Tom mentioned in his review he wished he had a, they had a stand. I agree with that.
[56:03.040 --> 56:07.040]  Wish there was some better way to prop up the watch on the nightstand.
[56:07.040 --> 56:17.040]  Yeah, I agree. I know it just keeps falling for me. Like, I keep every, you know, even if I string it around the back, I guess that's what I should do.
[56:17.040 --> 56:23.040]  But if it just keeps falling off the front. And also, again, like you said, I've been porting this thing all over the place.
[56:23.040 --> 56:30.040]  All right, I found it. I will put it in a show notes. There is a page it's apple.com slash watch slash battery dot HTML.
[56:30.040 --> 56:35.040]  And that's where they say that the, all the testing was conducted on a 38 millimeter.
[56:35.040 --> 56:46.040]  And this is directly quote from Apple. Apple watch battery performance claims are based on test results from the 38 millimeter Apple watch a 42 millimeter Apple watch typically experiences longer battery life.
[56:46.040 --> 56:48.040]  Hmm. So there you have it.
[56:48.040 --> 56:53.040]  You'd think, yeah, I mean, I guess, you know, given the surface space.
[56:53.040 --> 56:59.040]  Well, and I think it's exactly like with the iPhone six and the six plus the six plus does have a bigger screen.
[56:59.040 --> 57:12.040]  But it also gets better, bigger battery life because it's, it, it's just more important to have a bigger, bigger battery is more important than the, the detriment of a bigger screen to light up.
[57:12.040 --> 57:15.040]  Right. Right.
[57:15.040 --> 57:24.040]  Yeah. Yeah. So I pulled up my notes here. I started charging the watch at 733 PM and it finished charging at 920 PM.
[57:24.040 --> 57:26.040]  So just under two hours is what I had.
[57:26.040 --> 57:29.040]  My, uh, my sixth grade science experiment.
[57:29.040 --> 57:33.040]  We had to do a science fair experiment sixth grade in mine. I did mine on batteries.
[57:33.040 --> 57:37.040]  And the theory I wanted to test was, okay, everybody knows.
[57:37.040 --> 57:48.040]  You know, as alkaline batteries last longer, but are they cost effective? Does do you actually, is it worth your money to spend for the alkaline or just buy the cheap ones and use more of them?
[57:48.040 --> 57:55.040]  And so for to conduct the experiment, I put them into like a standard ever ready flashlight.
[57:55.040 --> 58:00.040]  You know, like the, just that same, you know, it's like that plastic flashlight everybody knows.
[58:00.040 --> 58:08.040]  And the problem was they all, even the cheap batteries would, would run the flashlight for like, like 20 some hours.
[58:08.040 --> 58:13.040]  And so it kept dying while I wasn't looking at it, you know, or like while I was sleeping.
[58:13.040 --> 58:25.040]  So my parents started getting really mad because just to get like one set of data to actually notice when the light was burned out, it took me like like three or four tries each.
[58:25.040 --> 58:34.040]  And I could imagine it's something like trying to test something like that. It's like, you have to keep looking at it to make sure if it's fully charged. And if you miss it, then you have to start all over again.
[58:34.040 --> 58:42.040]  It's true. I did have notes up till 80% and it was at 80% at 838.
[58:42.040 --> 58:49.040]  Also the results of my experiment were that alkaline batteries were worth the money.
[58:49.040 --> 58:56.040]  So now I feel like getting it out on the podcast makes all the effort I did 30 years ago.
[58:56.040 --> 59:00.040]  We're going to buy those batteries and see if I can put them into my Apple Watch.
[59:00.040 --> 59:04.040]  Let me take another break and it seems like a good time for a break and we can keep going on Apple.
[59:04.040 --> 59:09.040]  I want to get to the MacBook too, but it's, I feel like there's still so much more to cover with Apple Watch.
[59:09.040 --> 59:13.040]  And it's, I'm not going to give another chance to talk to someone else who's had it for a while.
[59:13.040 --> 59:18.040]  But let me thank our next sponsor and our good friends at Harries.
[59:18.040 --> 59:31.040]  Harries sells exceptional shaving stuff at a fraction of the price. They sell razor blades. They sell the handles. They sell shaving cream. They sell shaving gel. Anything you need for your shaving needs.
[59:31.040 --> 59:36.040]  Harries has it at harries.com. And here's the deal. They just looked at it. They looked at this scenario.
[59:36.040 --> 59:43.040]  The same way that Warby Parker looked at the eyeglasses thing where there's like this cartel pricing or why is this stuff so expensive?
[59:43.040 --> 59:51.040]  Why when you go into a drugstore is a three pack of razor blades $20 or whatever the heck it costs.
[59:51.040 --> 59:56.040]  Doesn't that just seem like it's way too expensive and they looked at the market and it turns out it was.
[59:56.040 --> 1:00:00.040]  So they started making their own blades. They actually are so serious about it.
[1:00:00.040 --> 1:00:04.040]  They bought a razor blade factory in Germany.
[1:00:04.040 --> 1:00:12.040]  To me it just shows how serious they are about it. They're making their own blades over in Germany at a factory that's been making razor blades for a long time.
[1:00:12.040 --> 1:00:17.040]  And then they ship them to the US and then they ship them right to you.
[1:00:17.040 --> 1:00:26.040]  There is no middleman. There's no markup for retail. You just go to harries.com. You sign up and they sell you blades that they made themselves.
[1:00:26.040 --> 1:00:31.040]  And that's the long term cost because you buy the handle from them and that's just one time and they last.
[1:00:31.040 --> 1:00:36.040]  Their handles are so nice. They're built to last. They're not hoping that they break and you have to buy another one.
[1:00:36.040 --> 1:00:39.040]  They're selling you a handle that's going to last for a long time.
[1:00:39.040 --> 1:00:42.040]  And then all you have to do is just keep buying the blades.
[1:00:42.040 --> 1:00:51.040]  You don't have to sign up for it at first. You can just sign up for a kit just to get a starter thing just to see if it's really as good as I'm telling you that it is.
[1:00:51.040 --> 1:00:58.040]  But then afterwards if you're convinced you can sign up for a plan you figure out how often you go through blades.
[1:00:58.040 --> 1:01:02.040]  You can sign up for a plan and then the blades just show up on a regular schedule.
[1:01:02.040 --> 1:01:08.040]  You tell them how often you go through blades and then they just show up when you need them and you never have to worry about it.
[1:01:08.040 --> 1:01:14.040]  Really, really good stuff. If you haven't tried it yet, I implore you two. You almost can't lose.
[1:01:14.040 --> 1:01:20.040]  Because here's the deal. Use the coupon code talk show. Just TALK SHOWW.
[1:01:20.040 --> 1:01:23.040]  Use that code and you save five bucks on your first order.
[1:01:23.040 --> 1:01:31.040]  They might say, well, five bucks who gives a crap. Here's the thing. They have a kit, a starter kit that comes with blades, a handle.
[1:01:31.040 --> 1:01:39.040]  Everything you need to get started. It's only 15 bucks. So for a $15 kit you save five bucks with that code, it's only 10 bucks.
[1:01:39.040 --> 1:01:50.040]  So that's like a 33% discount. So you can't lose. So go to Harries.com, H-A-R-R-Y-S dot com. Use the coupon code talk show on your first order and you'll save five bucks.
[1:01:50.040 --> 1:01:55.040]  You'd get it for 10 bucks. So go check them out. My thanks to Harries.
[1:01:55.040 --> 1:02:01.040]  Now I've got a Father's Day yet. This is great.
[1:02:01.040 --> 1:02:06.040]  It's just like, I'm just going to come on to this podcast every time I've got to buy gifts.
[1:02:06.040 --> 1:02:09.040]  I've, or listen, I guess I could listen.
[1:02:09.040 --> 1:02:15.040]  We haven't even talked about the software on the watch. And I feel, and I've barely wrote about it.
[1:02:15.040 --> 1:02:20.040]  So I've like this, I have a couple more thousand words still in draft. I'm working on it. It's coming out soon.
[1:02:20.040 --> 1:02:31.040]  I, it's, there's so much. It is such an ambitious 1.0 product. And I feel like, it's not even, there are things to complain about.
[1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:38.040]  And there are things to praise. It's, you know, and some of the things to complain about are clearly just 1.0 issues.
[1:02:38.040 --> 1:02:46.040]  Some of them I think are maybe deeper design questions. But it's just so expansive. It is really, really.
[1:02:46.040 --> 1:02:51.040]  It's the hardest product review I've ever read without question.
[1:02:51.040 --> 1:03:00.040]  I agree with you. I mean, we, we had the, the ability of the pleasure of having two reviewers, which was a good way to break it up.
[1:03:00.040 --> 1:03:03.040]  But still, there's so much that could be written about this thing.
[1:03:03.040 --> 1:03:08.040]  Yeah, you guys had to and recode had to.
[1:03:08.040 --> 1:03:20.040]  But yeah, and definitely I think helped to get comprehensive coverage from one publication because I really felt like there's just no way I could cover it all in a week.
[1:03:20.040 --> 1:03:27.040]  So let's just start. Here's one of the complaints from your review. I'm going to, well, I don't know if, here's what I'll say. It's just a line that I noted.
[1:03:27.040 --> 1:03:36.040]  You wrote, I love that you can customize the colors and details of the watch faces, though I do wish you could personalize it more with photos or backgrounds.
[1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:43.040]  And I have felt the same way. Like I've felt like this, it seems like it's, it's in contradiction.
[1:03:43.040 --> 1:03:51.040]  We're at one point. I've, I've felt like I can't believe how much fun I'm having just playing with the watch faces and getting them set up just the way I want.
[1:03:51.040 --> 1:03:57.040]  And then like an hour later, I would think, boy, I wish I could really customize this more.
[1:03:57.040 --> 1:04:06.040]  Yeah, I know. And it's like, I kind of kept thinking it was like, do I want to have a photo of, you know, I don't have a child now, I have a puppy.
[1:04:06.040 --> 1:04:17.040]  So maybe this is a good example. Would I want to have that on my watch? Like, it's now my home screen on my phone, but is that something I would want to have on my wrist all day?
[1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:31.040]  And I sort of collated, yeah, like, or at least to have the deeper background ability, right? Like, I love, I even on my phone, I frequently change my background on my phone, either on the lock screen or on the home screen.
[1:04:31.040 --> 1:04:33.040]  Why can't I do that here?
[1:04:33.040 --> 1:04:42.040]  I think it's a little, I've been thinking about it a lot. And I feel like they,
[1:04:42.040 --> 1:04:54.040]  I don't think they're going to give it to us. I don't think they're going to let us customize it more. I think they might add more built in watches, but I don't think there's going to be a third party ability.
[1:04:54.040 --> 1:04:57.040]  And certainly the current third party.
[1:04:57.040 --> 1:05:08.040]  I don't know if there would be a third party, but I think I could see down the line them giving the ability for us to change something from our, our camera role. I mean, the photos app is right there.
[1:05:08.040 --> 1:05:13.040]  And then it's right in here, like a little Ken Burns effect, right? Right, right, right.
[1:05:13.040 --> 1:05:18.040]  Do a little seven. Do a little Ken Burns effect. I've thought of that.
[1:05:18.040 --> 1:05:24.040]  This is a really important one, iTunes. It's an iTunes alert. It's really important. New, new artists on iTunes.
[1:05:24.040 --> 1:05:32.040]  All right, let's hold that thought because I do want to, I want to bring up this whole too many notifications issue. Let's, let's get to that next, but let's talk, keep talking about watch faces.
[1:05:32.040 --> 1:05:45.040]  I don't know. I feel like, but I feel like they're not going to do third party watch faces because I feel like they, they want all of the watch faces to still be within what they consider the Apple watch brand.
[1:05:45.040 --> 1:06:01.040]  And it makes me wonder about something like like the idea of pick one of your favorite photos and let that be the background is right there on the line because then obviously they're not going to have control over the photo, but they would still have complete
[1:06:01.040 --> 1:06:07.040]  control over the typography and placement of what's on top of it, the time, the date, whatever.
[1:06:07.040 --> 1:06:14.040]  Or the style, right, like where, where it goes. But what, what if, what, like here's a night, this is, I'm like now I'm going to design the watch face.
[1:06:14.040 --> 1:06:26.040]  So my favorite one is the modular one. Well, that's what I wear most days during the week. And then, you know, I like to change it around, but yeah, I like to keep playing with the design of the modular one.
[1:06:26.040 --> 1:06:34.040]  And so what if you could put your photo in like a corner or something, you know, just be like an avatar.
[1:06:34.040 --> 1:06:49.040]  Yeah, or like it was just a clean design where you had the time and then like, you know, above or below, sort of like Instagram's new layout app, right, where you could sort of split the screen a little bit or have it in a corner or something.
[1:06:49.040 --> 1:06:57.040]  I think they could design it really well is what I'm saying, I think. But, but still within like the constraint of a structure that they've defined.
[1:06:57.040 --> 1:06:59.040]  Yeah, I could see that fine.
[1:06:59.040 --> 1:07:15.040]  I mean, my guess is exactly what you're saying. Johnny, I didn't want his very, very cleanly perfectly designed watch faces to be tarnished by a photo of, I don't know, someone's ugly uncle or something.
[1:07:15.040 --> 1:07:21.040]  Or, you know, or mostly just that they didn't want us to to be playing around with it too much.
[1:07:21.040 --> 1:07:27.040]  I think they do want you playing around with it, but it's within these constraints of what they've defined as each of these watch faces.
[1:07:27.040 --> 1:07:35.040]  Now there's another angle here, which is technical, which is that the watch clearly the display is the biggest battery killer in the watch.
[1:07:35.040 --> 1:07:41.040]  And they're very aggressive about having it turn on and off as aggressively as possible that it's off most of the time.
[1:07:41.040 --> 1:07:50.040]  You tilt your wrist. I just did it as I said, and it was perfect. It was actually it turned on exactly as I looked at it could not have turned on at a just did it again.
[1:07:50.040 --> 1:07:55.040]  So right. However, I'm sitting right now is perfect posture for using Apple watch.
[1:07:55.040 --> 1:07:59.040]  But then it goes off in six seconds if you haven't tapped it and they're very aggressive with it.
[1:07:59.040 --> 1:08:10.040]  And it's an OLED screen, the first Apple device with an OLED screen and OLEDs, you know, reason for being I think is that it gets really deep blacks and the blacks don't.
[1:08:10.040 --> 1:08:16.040]  And the blacks don't require power and only requires power to light up pixels in a non black color.
[1:08:16.040 --> 1:08:21.040]  And the watch overall is dominated by black backgrounds.
[1:08:21.040 --> 1:08:32.040]  And part of it is an aesthetic idea because it really does make the display blend in to the entire sapphire or on the sport watch glass.
[1:08:32.040 --> 1:08:40.040]  And it's in most lighting. It's it's beautiful in bright daylight. You can definitely see where the display is.
[1:08:40.040 --> 1:08:46.040]  So it's aesthetic, but it's also technical where these black backgrounds absolutely increase the battery life.
[1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:52.040]  And if you had a photo in the background, it would have some kind of detrimental effect on that.
[1:08:52.040 --> 1:08:54.040]  That's really interesting.
[1:08:54.040 --> 1:08:59.040]  Even the fancy butterflies and jellyfish.
[1:08:59.040 --> 1:09:03.040]  Yeah, the background. It's still a lot of black.
[1:09:03.040 --> 1:09:05.040]  And they're kind of fade in.
[1:09:05.040 --> 1:09:06.040]  Yeah.
[1:09:06.040 --> 1:09:10.040]  So I can't help but think that that might be one of the reasons they don't have that.
[1:09:10.040 --> 1:09:14.040]  That to me seems like an obvious watch face. How much black?
[1:09:14.040 --> 1:09:16.040]  The most colorful one is Mickey.
[1:09:16.040 --> 1:09:18.040]  Yeah, I would definitely say so.
[1:09:18.040 --> 1:09:20.040]  The other one that can be colorful.
[1:09:20.040 --> 1:09:26.040]  I don't know if you played with this, but if you go to the chronograph watch face and you've customized the dial,
[1:09:26.040 --> 1:09:33.040]  you can change the dial to be like a light cream font color.
[1:09:33.040 --> 1:09:38.040]  So go to chronograph, go to color and let go over to the third.
[1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:40.040]  No, not third.
[1:09:40.040 --> 1:09:43.040]  It's the middle one where it says color.
[1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:46.040]  And if you go down, there's there's two light ones.
[1:09:46.040 --> 1:09:51.040]  There's a white background and then there's like a cream, a creamy like,
[1:09:51.040 --> 1:09:55.040]  I don't know what you would call it, which is the most lit up.
[1:09:55.040 --> 1:10:00.040]  I think that's the most lit up you can make the display.
[1:10:00.040 --> 1:10:03.040]  It's probably close with Mickey.
[1:10:03.040 --> 1:10:05.040]  But the other thing is I don't think they look.
[1:10:05.040 --> 1:10:07.040]  I think the chronograph looks better.
[1:10:07.040 --> 1:10:09.040]  One has a dark background.
[1:10:09.040 --> 1:10:11.040]  Yeah, Mickey might be the most.
[1:10:11.040 --> 1:10:15.040]  Yeah, I this banana pudding color is ugly.
[1:10:15.040 --> 1:10:17.040]  Yeah, I don't think that they're trying to mimic.
[1:10:17.040 --> 1:10:24.040]  I think it's the closest they've gotten to skew a morphism where I feel like they're trying to make that creamy one look like an aged dial from a analog watch.
[1:10:24.040 --> 1:10:34.040]  Like a lot of old, you know, people who collect analog watches, the older ones, things that used to be white turn to a sort of creamy, they call it a patina.
[1:10:34.040 --> 1:10:44.040]  And it's a really pleasing effect, you know, aesthetically, but it's, I don't know, somehow it falls flat on a light up screen.
[1:10:44.040 --> 1:10:52.040]  I think, but I think that that one of the things, and I know it's another one of the three things that Apple says the thing is, it's a great time piece, sort of.
[1:10:52.040 --> 1:10:54.040]  I think people are going to have a blast.
[1:10:54.040 --> 1:10:55.040]  I had a lot of fun.
[1:10:55.040 --> 1:10:56.040]  I know it sounds stupid.
[1:10:56.040 --> 1:10:57.040]  I have a lot of fun.
[1:10:57.040 --> 1:11:02.040]  I still have fun digging around with what I've got showing on the watch.
[1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:04.040]  Here's an example.
[1:11:04.040 --> 1:11:13.040]  So I got the watch and it's funny because I met with Apple while the old conference in Ireland was going on to get the review unit.
[1:11:13.040 --> 1:11:19.040]  And I was supposed to be there speaking and I couldn't because I can't fly with this gas bubble in my eye.
[1:11:19.040 --> 1:11:26.040]  But I was scheduled to do a remote appearance with this, oh, I'm going to forget the name of it, but I'm sure you've seen it.
[1:11:26.040 --> 1:11:34.040]  It's this, it's like a segue, a little segue type thing that you mount an iPad on, and then you can control it.
[1:11:34.040 --> 1:11:38.040]  It's like a remote telepresence robot.
[1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:40.040]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1:11:40.040 --> 1:11:41.040]  Right.
[1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:43.040]  Like the ones they have in all commercials.
[1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:46.040]  We don't have one in our office, but I've seen it in other offices.
[1:11:46.040 --> 1:11:52.040]  It sounds silly, but it was actually kind of fun, and I got to like drive it around the room at all.
[1:11:52.040 --> 1:12:00.040]  And I came out on stage and said a few words to the crowd and accidentally it's called double robotics.
[1:12:00.040 --> 1:12:05.040]  Yes, double robotics.
[1:12:05.040 --> 1:12:13.040]  But anyway, I had a scheduled appearance over remotely in Ireland, and I was awesome.
[1:12:13.040 --> 1:12:19.040]  I thought it was so great that I could put on my watch face the time in that time zone.
[1:12:19.040 --> 1:12:21.040]  It just up in the corner.
[1:12:21.040 --> 1:12:26.040]  And so it like totally alleviated my anxiety that I was going to botch it.
[1:12:26.040 --> 1:12:34.040]  And to further confuse it, it was daylight savings time weekend in the United Kingdom, which is different than when it was here.
[1:12:34.040 --> 1:12:38.040]  So everything was going to switch on Sunday night or something like that.
[1:12:38.040 --> 1:12:42.040]  So instead of being like plus four, they were going to switch to plus five.
[1:12:42.040 --> 1:12:48.040]  I just put the time up in my corner in Ireland, and I knew that I wasn't going to be late.
[1:12:48.040 --> 1:12:49.040]  Little thing.
[1:12:49.040 --> 1:12:53.040]  And then once I was done with that, I had no concern about what time it was in England anymore.
[1:12:53.040 --> 1:12:58.040]  So I just turned that off and switched it to my fitness tracking or something.
[1:12:58.040 --> 1:12:59.040]  Yeah.
[1:12:59.040 --> 1:13:05.040]  Now that's why I love that modular display, because I can fit so much info on there, which could be distracting to people.
[1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:15.040]  I love it, and I keep changing the top left hand corner to either California time, like you mentioned, or to the sunset time.
[1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:16.040]  Yeah, that seems useful.
[1:13:16.040 --> 1:13:17.040]  I might actually use that now.
[1:13:17.040 --> 1:13:19.040]  I've been meaning to try that.
[1:13:19.040 --> 1:13:24.040]  I don't get, it sounds corny, but I also like changed them based on my outfit.
[1:13:24.040 --> 1:13:28.040]  Like I know a lot of people thought I was being super sarcastic in that video.
[1:13:28.040 --> 1:13:36.040]  And I guess I kind of was, but I do like that either the butterfly or the flower watch face for when I go out.
[1:13:36.040 --> 1:13:38.040]  Yeah, I could totally see that.
[1:13:38.040 --> 1:13:44.040]  Just because you want less, you know, like in the daytime you've got meetings, you've got things you really do want to see your appointment.
[1:13:44.040 --> 1:13:48.040]  And then if you're just going out at night and you're going to have dinner, you really don't need all that crap.
[1:13:48.040 --> 1:13:56.040]  And a couple of days there, I was changing the color of the modular font to the color of the shirt I was wearing.
[1:13:56.040 --> 1:13:58.040]  So it's super corny, but it was fun.
[1:13:58.040 --> 1:13:59.040]  Yeah, I don't know.
[1:13:59.040 --> 1:14:08.040]  It's, if you can't, if you're so technically minded that you can't imagine that it's fun to do things like change the second hand on your watch based on your whims,
[1:14:08.040 --> 1:14:12.040]  then it's, you're not going to see the appeal of this device compared to other ones.
[1:14:12.040 --> 1:14:14.040]  I do. I think it was kind of fun.
[1:14:14.040 --> 1:14:15.040]  Right.
[1:14:15.040 --> 1:14:16.040]  I like changing the second hand.
[1:14:16.040 --> 1:14:17.040]  I like the blue second hand.
[1:14:17.040 --> 1:14:19.040]  I don't know why.
[1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:23.040]  I will admit, I don't really use that.
[1:14:23.040 --> 1:14:25.040]  You don't use the analog ones.
[1:14:25.040 --> 1:14:27.040]  See, that to me is a big deal.
[1:14:27.040 --> 1:14:39.040]  And because I've all I've worn an analog dial watch for so many years now, my brain naturally understands time only by the hands.
[1:14:39.040 --> 1:14:48.040]  And so if I look at a digital watch, meaning digital like it's showing the digits, because I feel like the word digital watch is actually confusing.
[1:14:48.040 --> 1:15:06.040]  It's, it requires a long discretion, digression, but it's like, it means two different things. One, it means an electronic watch that is digitally driven in terms of how it keeps time as opposed to an analog watch, which is using gears and purely mechanical, nothing electronic.
[1:15:06.040 --> 1:15:16.040]  But digital watch also can mean a watch that is showing the time through numeric digits as opposed through analog hands.
[1:15:16.040 --> 1:15:33.040]  And to me, there's nothing at all false in terms of like this whole movement away from skeuomorphism about having a digital watch in terms of it's being electronic, using an analog dial in terms of showing time with the hands.
[1:15:33.040 --> 1:15:36.040]  It's just a different way of displaying the information.
[1:15:36.040 --> 1:15:43.040]  And when you have these analog hands on the Apple watch, they don't have any drop shadows or 3D effects or anything like that.
[1:15:43.040 --> 1:15:49.040]  It's very, very flat, and I think very natural, but that to me is how I tell time.
[1:15:49.040 --> 1:15:56.040]  And it's also why, like in my review where I mentioned that when I met my keyboard, I'll often glance at my wrist to see the time.
[1:15:56.040 --> 1:16:03.040]  And everybody's like, you know, and I even said, yes, I know the time is up in the corner of my Mac, but it just doesn't make sense to me.
[1:16:03.040 --> 1:16:11.040]  And like, just without having to even think about it way that it does when I glance at my wrist.
[1:16:11.040 --> 1:16:17.040]  And that's where I think like, that's one part of the software I think they have done such a good job at.
[1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:24.040]  Because you're talking about these things that work so well for you personally, which I could care less about.
[1:16:24.040 --> 1:16:32.040]  I mean, I care about you, but I don't care about them for me, and I found some layouts that just work so well for me.
[1:16:32.040 --> 1:16:42.040]  I've also worn an analog watch for a long time, but with this, like, it just helps me so much to see my calendar appointments.
[1:16:42.040 --> 1:16:49.040]  And like, for me, that's been like, I can just glance down, and I don't, and I'm, yes, I same sort of thing.
[1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:57.040]  Yes, I get the pop-up notification from Outlook or whatever on my phone, but I sort of, I'm able to budget my time better knowing,
[1:16:57.040 --> 1:17:02.040]  okay, I have two more hours till I have this puppy training class or what.
[1:17:02.040 --> 1:17:11.040]  Yeah, and I can even see, I think it shows that people at Apple, especially the people on the creative team behind it,
[1:17:11.040 --> 1:17:17.040]  have a very meeting-driven culture where there's, you know, they're in a big company, they're working at the same time.
[1:17:17.040 --> 1:17:22.040]  And they have these things like, you know, design meetings and stuff like that.
[1:17:22.040 --> 1:17:27.040]  I think it really shows that the watch can be set up.
[1:17:27.040 --> 1:17:30.040]  You can configure it in a way that's really, really conducive to that.
[1:17:30.040 --> 1:17:32.040]  And I can also see why.
[1:17:32.040 --> 1:17:33.040]  I'll bet you're right.
[1:17:33.040 --> 1:17:37.040]  I don't think it's a coincidence that the modular face is the second one.
[1:17:37.040 --> 1:17:45.040]  I think that for somebody who has a very frequently has meetings and has a, you know, a lot of events on their calendar,
[1:17:45.040 --> 1:17:48.040]  that that modular one is really going to be popular.
[1:17:48.040 --> 1:17:57.040]  And I can also see why then you would want the time in, in a digital form because then you see the numbers of the current time
[1:17:57.040 --> 1:18:00.040]  and you see the numbers of the meeting that's coming up.
[1:18:00.040 --> 1:18:05.040]  And you know, hey, it's already 1048 and I've got an 1130.
[1:18:05.040 --> 1:18:08.040]  So anything I want to do, it's got it, you know.
[1:18:08.040 --> 1:18:10.040]  I mean, I'm looking at mine right now and there's so many numbers.
[1:18:10.040 --> 1:18:12.040]  I mean, and I hate numbers.
[1:18:12.040 --> 1:18:14.040]  It's really funny that I like this one so much.
[1:18:14.040 --> 1:18:18.040]  But like I've got the time, I've got my next appointment.
[1:18:18.040 --> 1:18:21.040]  I've got the temperature outside.
[1:18:21.040 --> 1:18:26.040]  I've got the battery life icon 76 right now.
[1:18:26.040 --> 1:18:29.040]  The sun sets at 732.
[1:18:29.040 --> 1:18:33.040]  And I love all that information.
[1:18:33.040 --> 1:18:36.040]  I didn't even notice you could change the color on that one.
[1:18:36.040 --> 1:18:37.040]  Yeah.
[1:18:37.040 --> 1:18:42.040]  So I changed it today to purple because I was wearing a purple shirt.
[1:18:42.040 --> 1:18:45.040]  Small things, you know, small things.
[1:18:45.040 --> 1:18:48.040]  But yeah, I mean, and as I said,
[1:18:48.040 --> 1:18:52.040]  I mean, like those are the two big things both telling time and keeping me on schedule.
[1:18:52.040 --> 1:18:57.040]  And as a fitness tracker or fitness device where this thing is really started to play big in my life.
[1:18:57.040 --> 1:19:09.040]  Though over the last week and maybe my piece next week might be on this is sort of about that notification thing and how I've found a good balance in many ways despite the fact that it's gone off like eight times on this very broadcast.
[1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:12.040]  Let's talk about that next, but I have, I mean, not another sponsor out here.
[1:19:12.040 --> 1:19:15.040]  And it's our good friends at backblays.
[1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:17.040]  Now they were a long time sponsor of the show.
[1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:19.040]  They've been, they've gone for a while, but now they're back.
[1:19:19.040 --> 1:19:29.040]  They offer unlimited, unthrottle, uncomplicated backup for your Mac, all of your Macs for just $5 a month per Mac.
[1:19:29.040 --> 1:19:30.040]  Here's what the deal.
[1:19:30.040 --> 1:19:31.040]  Here's what you do.
[1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:33.040]  It sounds too good to be true, but I swear it works.
[1:19:33.040 --> 1:19:34.040]  I've used it.
[1:19:34.040 --> 1:19:37.040]  You just go to backblays.com.
[1:19:37.040 --> 1:19:44.040]  You can add slash during fireballs to the, you know, they know you came from here backblays.com slash during fireball.
[1:19:44.040 --> 1:19:45.040]  You go there.
[1:19:45.040 --> 1:19:47.040]  You download their Mac software.
[1:19:47.040 --> 1:19:50.040]  You open the Mac software and you install it.
[1:19:50.040 --> 1:19:58.040]  It's good software really that their engineers, our former Apple employees, they know Mac OS X, they know OS X.
[1:19:58.040 --> 1:20:03.040]  It's not like some kind of thing that was written by people who were, you know, Windows programmers and then they did a Mac version.
[1:20:03.040 --> 1:20:05.040]  It's good Mac software.
[1:20:05.040 --> 1:20:08.040]  Then you get to it through system preferences.
[1:20:08.040 --> 1:20:11.040]  There's a system preference panel that you can figure everything through.
[1:20:11.040 --> 1:20:20.040]  It just runs in the background and it backs up everything on your Mac to their cloud-based servers.
[1:20:20.040 --> 1:20:25.040]  Takes a while for the first one, depending on your upstream bandwidth.
[1:20:25.040 --> 1:20:28.040]  But just let it run, let it run, and eventually it's there.
[1:20:28.040 --> 1:20:32.040]  And then after they have all of your data, everything is just incremental after that.
[1:20:32.040 --> 1:20:36.040]  You can try it for a month for free, just about anybody with a modern internet connection.
[1:20:36.040 --> 1:20:38.040]  It's going to get everything uploaded within days.
[1:20:38.040 --> 1:20:40.040]  And here's the thing, there is no limit.
[1:20:40.040 --> 1:20:46.040]  You might say, well, yeah, there's no limit, but there's an asterisk because I have a four terabyte collection of photographs.
[1:20:46.040 --> 1:20:48.040]  Doesn't matter how big your stuff is.
[1:20:48.040 --> 1:20:54.040]  Anything connected to your Mac, all of it goes up into your backblays account for five bucks a month.
[1:20:54.040 --> 1:20:56.040]  And there's no tearing, anything like that.
[1:20:56.040 --> 1:21:01.040]  You just pay $5 per month for your Mac and whatever your data size is, it all just goes there.
[1:21:01.040 --> 1:21:07.040]  The only catch, if you can call it catch is if you have two Macs, then you have to pay for each one.
[1:21:07.040 --> 1:21:11.040]  Five bucks, five bucks for each one, and then everything is backed up.
[1:21:11.040 --> 1:21:14.040]  And they have apps for iOS.
[1:21:14.040 --> 1:21:19.040]  So you can do things like while you're on your phone, and you need to get some file.
[1:21:19.040 --> 1:21:22.040]  You can just go to the Backblays app, and all of your stuff is already there.
[1:21:22.040 --> 1:21:29.040]  You can go get that file and do, you know, shoot, use the sharing sheet from the iPhone and send it by text message,
[1:21:29.040 --> 1:21:32.040]  or email, or whatever.
[1:21:32.040 --> 1:21:34.040]  So you don't even have to have your Mac with you to access those files.
[1:21:34.040 --> 1:21:37.040]  It's a great way to access your files from anywhere.
[1:21:37.040 --> 1:21:40.040]  What do you do when disaster strikes?
[1:21:40.040 --> 1:21:44.040]  You know, your hard drive freezes up, gone, could put.
[1:21:44.040 --> 1:21:49.040]  Or your God forbid your MacBook gets stolen, or water damaged, or something like that.
[1:21:49.040 --> 1:21:52.040]  You can download everything if you want.
[1:21:52.040 --> 1:21:53.040]  It'll take a while.
[1:21:53.040 --> 1:21:54.040]  But you can do something.
[1:21:54.040 --> 1:21:55.040]  You can just buy a hard drive.
[1:21:55.040 --> 1:21:57.040]  They'll sell you a USB hard drive at cost.
[1:21:57.040 --> 1:22:00.040]  They'll just load all your data onto it.
[1:22:00.040 --> 1:22:03.040]  And, you know, pay for overnight shipping.
[1:22:03.040 --> 1:22:08.040]  And the next day, you get a USB hard drive that has all of your stuff on it.
[1:22:08.040 --> 1:22:09.040]  Really great service.
[1:22:09.040 --> 1:22:10.040]  It works great.
[1:22:10.040 --> 1:22:14.040]  And the peace of mind of this is just phenomenal.
[1:22:14.040 --> 1:22:17.040]  Joanna mentioned earlier, Mother's Day is coming up.
[1:22:17.040 --> 1:22:18.040]  How about this?
[1:22:18.040 --> 1:22:19.040]  Don't even, you have to get a real gift.
[1:22:19.040 --> 1:22:20.040]  So get out of the fracture too.
[1:22:20.040 --> 1:22:23.040]  You can't just say, hey, your Mother's Day gift is I'm backing up your Mac.
[1:22:23.040 --> 1:22:25.040]  But just do it for it.
[1:22:25.040 --> 1:22:27.040]  Don't even tell her, just go sign her up for backblaze.
[1:22:27.040 --> 1:22:29.040]  Pay the $5 a month for it.
[1:22:29.040 --> 1:22:32.040]  And then you know that your mom's Mac is backed up.
[1:22:32.040 --> 1:22:33.040]  And nothing she does to it.
[1:22:33.040 --> 1:22:34.040]  Nothing that can happen.
[1:22:34.040 --> 1:22:36.040]  She's going to lose anything from it.
[1:22:36.040 --> 1:22:37.040]  Really can't thank them enough.
[1:22:37.040 --> 1:22:41.040]  Go to backblaze.com slash daringfireball and sign up.
[1:22:41.040 --> 1:22:43.040]  Can't recommend them highly enough.
[1:22:43.040 --> 1:22:48.040]  I love that you just told people to get back up software for their mom.
[1:22:48.040 --> 1:22:50.040]  Yeah, but you have to get them something else.
[1:22:50.040 --> 1:22:54.040]  Do not do not give your mom back up software and tell her that John Gruber told her
[1:22:54.040 --> 1:22:56.040]  that was a good gift.
[1:22:56.040 --> 1:22:57.040]  You've got to get a full...
[1:22:57.040 --> 1:23:00.040]  You just told everyone to get their mom back up software.
[1:23:00.040 --> 1:23:03.040]  Gotta get her flowers or a fracture or something too.
[1:23:03.040 --> 1:23:08.040]  All of you listening who get your mom just back up software,
[1:23:08.040 --> 1:23:10.040]  you are terrible children.
[1:23:10.040 --> 1:23:12.040]  All right, I want to talk about notifications on this thing.
[1:23:12.040 --> 1:23:17.040]  Because I thought that if there's one thing that I saw across the reviews that to me,
[1:23:17.040 --> 1:23:21.040]  I didn't get where complaints from reviewers saying,
[1:23:21.040 --> 1:23:25.040]  well, my risk is keeps pinging, pinging, pinging, it can be annoying.
[1:23:25.040 --> 1:23:29.040]  Because I think it's really easy to filter it and to say,
[1:23:29.040 --> 1:23:31.040]  I kind of...
[1:23:31.040 --> 1:23:35.040]  One of the things that you're getting used to is learning what you have to do
[1:23:35.040 --> 1:23:40.040]  from the Apple Watch app on your phone and what you can configure on the watch alone.
[1:23:40.040 --> 1:23:41.040]  It is a little...
[1:23:41.040 --> 1:23:42.040]  It takes some getting used to.
[1:23:42.040 --> 1:23:44.040]  I don't think it's a complaint.
[1:23:44.040 --> 1:23:46.040]  I can see why you can't...
[1:23:46.040 --> 1:23:49.040]  That why they don't put everything on the watch.
[1:23:49.040 --> 1:23:52.040]  But one of the things that you do from the phone,
[1:23:52.040 --> 1:23:55.040]  from the Apple Watch app on the phone, as you go to the Apple Watch app,
[1:23:55.040 --> 1:23:56.040]  you go to notifications.
[1:23:56.040 --> 1:24:01.040]  And then it just lists all of the apps on your phone that have notifications turned on.
[1:24:01.040 --> 1:24:06.040]  And then you can turn off on an app by app basis whether they go to your watch.
[1:24:06.040 --> 1:24:09.040]  And so every time I got something on my watch that annoyed me,
[1:24:09.040 --> 1:24:12.040]  I would just go to my phone, go to that app, turn it off and say,
[1:24:12.040 --> 1:24:13.040]  I don't want that anymore.
[1:24:13.040 --> 1:24:15.040]  No more periscope notifications on my watch.
[1:24:15.040 --> 1:24:18.040]  That was the first thing I did.
[1:24:18.040 --> 1:24:22.040]  Like after I parted ways with Apple and I had the review,
[1:24:22.040 --> 1:24:25.040]  I think it took about two minutes for me to just say,
[1:24:25.040 --> 1:24:27.040]  all right periscope, you're gone.
[1:24:27.040 --> 1:24:30.040]  I had a bunch of things like that.
[1:24:30.040 --> 1:24:32.040]  I'm looking through my list now.
[1:24:32.040 --> 1:24:37.040]  I found anything that didn't let me respond, I wanted off.
[1:24:37.040 --> 1:24:40.040]  So for example, tweet bot, direct messages.
[1:24:40.040 --> 1:24:42.040]  I love direct messages.
[1:24:42.040 --> 1:24:45.040]  There's very close to text, so I want notifications for them.
[1:24:45.040 --> 1:24:49.040]  It's in fact the only thing I get notifications from Twitter related.
[1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:53.040]  Just because I know a lot of people have replies and mentions and stuff like that.
[1:24:53.040 --> 1:24:56.040]  But people like, we have too many, you know,
[1:24:56.040 --> 1:25:02.040]  where it's just in a weird, you know, the way that we're weird micro celebrities, you know.
[1:25:02.040 --> 1:25:07.040]  It sounds stupid, but I get, I don't know, two or three hundred replies a day.
[1:25:07.040 --> 1:25:11.040]  I cannot possibly, or I could, but I mean, it would drive me insane
[1:25:11.040 --> 1:25:13.040]  if I got notifications for them.
[1:25:13.040 --> 1:25:18.040]  But I thought DM's on my watch were annoying too, because I couldn't do anything with them.
[1:25:18.040 --> 1:25:23.040]  And you can't really do anything with email either.
[1:25:23.040 --> 1:25:24.040]  We can get to that.
[1:25:24.040 --> 1:25:28.040]  I find the inclusion of email on Apple Watch to be bizarre.
[1:25:28.040 --> 1:25:32.040]  And it seems like something, it seems like one of the best apps that they wrote,
[1:25:32.040 --> 1:25:34.040]  it works incredibly well.
[1:25:34.040 --> 1:25:39.040]  And I feel like somebody really knocked it out of the park building it,
[1:25:39.040 --> 1:25:44.040]  but I don't understand why.
[1:25:44.040 --> 1:25:45.040]  Because you can't reply.
[1:25:45.040 --> 1:25:49.040]  There is no way to reply to an email.
[1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:53.040]  I guess I can understand, you know, I,
[1:25:53.040 --> 1:25:56.040]  I say that and I'm being a little bit hyperbolic,
[1:25:56.040 --> 1:25:59.040]  because I understand that sometimes if you get a really important email,
[1:25:59.040 --> 1:26:01.040]  you might want to see it right there on the watch.
[1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:05.040]  And then you have to do something on the phone.
[1:26:05.040 --> 1:26:11.040]  Yeah, I don't know if there's certain, it crosses a line that to me,
[1:26:11.040 --> 1:26:14.040]  it's why I never liked wearing my original pebble.
[1:26:14.040 --> 1:26:17.040]  Put aside the size of the pebble and the screen and whatever.
[1:26:17.040 --> 1:26:20.040]  The thing that always got me with the original pebble was I could never respond.
[1:26:20.040 --> 1:26:22.040]  I always had to go back to the phone.
[1:26:22.040 --> 1:26:25.040]  And every once in a while I'd get, you know, as I tried it,
[1:26:25.040 --> 1:26:27.040]  I'd say like, well, I'm glad I saw that on my wrist,
[1:26:27.040 --> 1:26:29.040]  but now I have to go to my phone to reply.
[1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:34.040]  Like I reply to text messages using the watch frequently.
[1:26:34.040 --> 1:26:36.040]  You do voice.
[1:26:36.040 --> 1:26:41.040]  Or with sometimes some, you know, the auto buttons are actually pretty good in some cases.
[1:26:41.040 --> 1:26:42.040]  Yeah, they're pretty good.
[1:26:42.040 --> 1:26:43.040]  Right.
[1:26:43.040 --> 1:26:45.040]  And you can set those.
[1:26:45.040 --> 1:26:48.040]  Yeah, but the voice works pretty well for me.
[1:26:48.040 --> 1:26:54.040]  And again, that is going to vary by your, you know, your current cellular collection connection.
[1:26:54.040 --> 1:27:01.040]  But I wrote weeks ago that I have found Siri to be getting a lot better at dictation,
[1:27:01.040 --> 1:27:05.040]  at very least in terms of, you know, just when you talk to Siri,
[1:27:05.040 --> 1:27:09.040]  whether it's on the watch or on the phone, the transcription happens faster.
[1:27:09.040 --> 1:27:12.040]  It seems to be happening a lot more accurately.
[1:27:12.040 --> 1:27:13.040]  And it's really pretty good.
[1:27:13.040 --> 1:27:18.040]  And it's a little frustrating from the, here's the biggest frustration on the watch is there's no text editing.
[1:27:18.040 --> 1:27:25.040]  So if it gets it almost right, if I dictate a sentence-long response via the watch,
[1:27:25.040 --> 1:27:27.040]  but it has one,
[1:27:27.040 --> 1:27:31.040]  that's Siriism, whatever you want to call the typos that Siri gets.
[1:27:31.040 --> 1:27:35.040]  You have to decide whether you scrap the whole thing and start over,
[1:27:35.040 --> 1:27:40.040]  or just let it fly and hope that your correspondent sympathizes and understands.
[1:27:40.040 --> 1:27:41.040]  Right.
[1:27:41.040 --> 1:27:43.040]  Yeah, I found it.
[1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:48.040]  One thing I did find Siri really helpful with, and I know you can't respond to emails,
[1:27:48.040 --> 1:27:49.040]  but it is helpful.
[1:27:49.040 --> 1:27:53.040]  Like if I get an email, it says a company can meet at 2 p.m.
[1:27:53.040 --> 1:28:00.040]  I have Siri make that, I've done this, had Siri make that appointment on my calendar through the watch.
[1:28:00.040 --> 1:28:05.040]  I guess it would really be nice to be able to respond to those people and say,
[1:28:05.040 --> 1:28:07.040]  yes, I can make that meeting.
[1:28:07.040 --> 1:28:11.040]  I understand why they don't let you respond and they do for texts,
[1:28:11.040 --> 1:28:15.040]  because texts tend to be one sentence at a time.
[1:28:15.040 --> 1:28:20.040]  And even though you might send to some emails,
[1:28:20.040 --> 1:28:25.040]  yes, to a clock is fine, or absolutely, or something like that,
[1:28:25.040 --> 1:28:28.040]  a lot of times you don't.
[1:28:28.040 --> 1:28:31.040]  There's a lot of emails that required even just a few sentences,
[1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:33.040]  and once you get to a few sentences,
[1:28:33.040 --> 1:28:36.040]  the odds of the dictation being perfect are very low.
[1:28:36.040 --> 1:28:38.040]  And the fact that you can't text at it, you know,
[1:28:38.040 --> 1:28:41.040]  I do the dictation on my phone tons too,
[1:28:41.040 --> 1:28:43.040]  especially on the East Coast and Winter,
[1:28:43.040 --> 1:28:46.040]  where my hands are cold and I might be outside.
[1:28:46.040 --> 1:28:49.040]  And again, that's what made me write the thing a couple of weeks ago about
[1:28:49.040 --> 1:28:51.040]  how I've noticed that it's getting better.
[1:28:51.040 --> 1:28:55.040]  But the thing with the phone is if there's one stupid mistake
[1:28:55.040 --> 1:29:00.040]  in what Siri transcribed, you can double-click that word,
[1:29:00.040 --> 1:29:03.040]  hit the microphone button again, and replace that one word
[1:29:03.040 --> 1:29:07.040]  by, you know, enunciating much more, you know, as clearly as you can,
[1:29:07.040 --> 1:29:10.040]  what that word was, you can't do that with the watch.
[1:29:10.040 --> 1:29:14.040]  And it's like the one downside to that.
[1:29:14.040 --> 1:29:21.040]  Yeah, I mean, yeah, I've just, in terms of email,
[1:29:21.040 --> 1:29:26.040]  I have a lot more frustrations that go way beyond the reply stuff.
[1:29:26.040 --> 1:29:30.040]  But again, I think that's mostly my frustrations
[1:29:30.040 --> 1:29:35.040]  with some of the notification customization features or lack thereof.
[1:29:35.040 --> 1:29:45.040]  Yeah, I mean, one thing, and I've set up VIP,
[1:29:45.040 --> 1:29:48.040]  but to me, VIP doesn't go far enough, right?
[1:29:48.040 --> 1:29:54.040]  And this is some of the intelligence that I think Apple stands to learn a lot from Google
[1:29:54.040 --> 1:29:59.040]  and where I do feel like the missing presence of Google on this device
[1:29:59.040 --> 1:30:01.040]  is in Gmail, for instance.
[1:30:01.040 --> 1:30:06.040]  I mean, yes, I do get the notifications that hit in, like I use inbox.
[1:30:06.040 --> 1:30:09.040]  I do get those notifications on my wrist.
[1:30:09.040 --> 1:30:12.040]  And those are usually really helpful.
[1:30:12.040 --> 1:30:15.040]  Usually inbox is really good at knowing when I like emails
[1:30:15.040 --> 1:30:19.040]  or when I don't like emails, you know, surfacing ones from friends
[1:30:19.040 --> 1:30:22.040]  and family putting the other ones in their other filters.
[1:30:22.040 --> 1:30:26.040]  I don't know if John, if you use it, but I find it really helpful.
[1:30:26.040 --> 1:30:32.040]  And in mail, it's just, there's so many other emails beyond VIP,
[1:30:32.040 --> 1:30:37.040]  those people that I've designated as VIPs that I want coming to my wrist,
[1:30:37.040 --> 1:30:41.040]  and it's just you don't have that level of granularity.
[1:30:41.040 --> 1:30:46.040]  You can't, you know, mail doesn't know well enough
[1:30:46.040 --> 1:30:50.040]  which people I'd like to respond to, which emails are important to me.
[1:30:50.040 --> 1:30:56.040]  Yeah, I think Steven Levy had a piece just maybe yesterday.
[1:30:56.040 --> 1:30:59.040]  Well, at his back channel thing at Medium,
[1:30:59.040 --> 1:31:04.040]  where he talked about like that we need like the next level for AI to go
[1:31:04.040 --> 1:31:07.040]  is notification filtering.
[1:31:07.040 --> 1:31:08.040]  Yeah, it is.
[1:31:08.040 --> 1:31:11.040]  It's too, it's too hard to do by rules.
[1:31:11.040 --> 1:31:13.040]  And I think back to spam filtering.
[1:31:13.040 --> 1:31:18.040]  I remember when spam first became a problem with email,
[1:31:18.040 --> 1:31:20.040]  you know, like in the late 90s.
[1:31:20.040 --> 1:31:24.040]  And the way I dealt with it and the way most people I knew dealt with it
[1:31:24.040 --> 1:31:27.040]  is we had a bunch of filters, rules.
[1:31:27.040 --> 1:31:31.040]  You know, you just set up your mail client with a bunch of rules
[1:31:31.040 --> 1:31:35.040]  and there was, you know, I don't know, little things like,
[1:31:35.040 --> 1:31:36.040]  I still do that.
[1:31:36.040 --> 1:31:39.040]  Like if you're on corporate mailing list, you still have to do that.
[1:31:39.040 --> 1:31:42.040]  You do it definitely, but for the most part, the most spam is already,
[1:31:42.040 --> 1:31:46.040]  you know, there's no way that you could have without something like, you know,
[1:31:46.040 --> 1:31:50.040]  a system level above you, not your rules.
[1:31:50.040 --> 1:31:54.040]  You'd be inundated and because they just, it's whackable.
[1:31:54.040 --> 1:31:58.040]  I remember, but there were like, you know, six or seven rules you could use
[1:31:58.040 --> 1:32:01.040]  and then boom, you could cut your spam by like 90%.
[1:32:01.040 --> 1:32:03.040]  And it's just not enough anymore.
[1:32:03.040 --> 1:32:06.040]  And I kind of feel like notifications are that way,
[1:32:06.040 --> 1:32:09.040]  where you can, right now it's like we're at that era
[1:32:09.040 --> 1:32:11.040]  where we're setting up our own filters.
[1:32:11.040 --> 1:32:15.040]  Like you're saying, okay, I don't want all my email,
[1:32:15.040 --> 1:32:19.040]  that's crazy, but I do want the people on this VIP list.
[1:32:19.040 --> 1:32:20.040]  Okay, there you go.
[1:32:20.040 --> 1:32:22.040]  And it's, I see, I know what you mean though,
[1:32:22.040 --> 1:32:25.040]  because there's always going to be an important email that isn't
[1:32:25.040 --> 1:32:28.040]  from someone who's already on your VIP list and then you're going to,
[1:32:28.040 --> 1:32:29.040]  you want that.
[1:32:29.040 --> 1:32:34.040]  And it seems as though there ought to be a way for AI to figure that out.
[1:32:34.040 --> 1:32:36.040]  And it's, you know, and if anybody's going to get that best,
[1:32:36.040 --> 1:32:39.040]  if anybody's doing it already, it's definitely Google
[1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:42.040]  because it's right, right, and it's,
[1:32:42.040 --> 1:32:45.040]  yeah, for sure.
[1:32:45.040 --> 1:32:46.040]  And I mean, that's like, for instance,
[1:32:46.040 --> 1:32:48.040]  while you keep hearing these pings today,
[1:32:48.040 --> 1:32:50.040]  because I've been out and about with the puppy
[1:32:50.040 --> 1:32:52.040]  and I wanted to keep my email alerts on,
[1:32:52.040 --> 1:32:55.040]  because I've been waiting for an email back from Google, actually.
[1:32:55.040 --> 1:32:59.040]  And if I turned on my VIP thing,
[1:32:59.040 --> 1:33:03.040]  like I don't have that specific contact as of VIP,
[1:33:03.040 --> 1:33:05.040]  why would I, right?
[1:33:05.040 --> 1:33:07.040]  But if I don't, if I don't like,
[1:33:07.040 --> 1:33:10.040]  there's no way to get the stuff in the middle, right?
[1:33:10.040 --> 1:33:12.040]  It's either, it's giving me the lowest hanging stuff,
[1:33:12.040 --> 1:33:15.040]  which is like emails from, you know,
[1:33:15.040 --> 1:33:19.040]  general Wall Street Journal editors about SEO term words.
[1:33:19.040 --> 1:33:23.040]  And then I'm getting iTunes spam,
[1:33:23.040 --> 1:33:26.040]  and then I'm getting when that email comes in from that person
[1:33:26.040 --> 1:33:28.040]  from Google and immediately on my wrist,
[1:33:28.040 --> 1:33:30.040]  when I'm out and about in the apartment.
[1:33:30.040 --> 1:33:31.040]  Can I tell you, it just kicked in,
[1:33:31.040 --> 1:33:33.040]  because I had this show on my watch,
[1:33:33.040 --> 1:33:36.040]  and I guess I only had it scheduled for 90 minutes,
[1:33:36.040 --> 1:33:37.040]  so it's over.
[1:33:37.040 --> 1:33:39.040]  One of my least favorite things on the watch face
[1:33:39.040 --> 1:33:42.040]  is if you have your next event as one of the complications,
[1:33:42.040 --> 1:33:44.040]  when you're done for the day,
[1:33:44.040 --> 1:33:47.040]  it changes to say no more events,
[1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:49.040]  and it's like in all capital letters,
[1:33:49.040 --> 1:33:53.040]  and it just seems like visual pollution to me.
[1:33:53.040 --> 1:33:54.040]  No more events.
[1:33:54.040 --> 1:33:56.040]  It makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong
[1:33:56.040 --> 1:33:58.040]  that I don't have anything else scheduled today.
[1:33:58.040 --> 1:34:00.040]  You have nothing else to do today.
[1:34:00.040 --> 1:34:02.040]  You can go to bed.
[1:34:02.040 --> 1:34:03.040]  No, I totally agree with the notification.
[1:34:03.040 --> 1:34:07.040]  I want this whole thing to just figure out
[1:34:07.040 --> 1:34:10.040]  what I want on my wrist.
[1:34:10.040 --> 1:34:12.040]  It could maybe use,
[1:34:12.040 --> 1:34:15.040]  maybe if there was a way to give a thumbs down
[1:34:15.040 --> 1:34:17.040]  to a notification that gets through,
[1:34:17.040 --> 1:34:20.040]  and maybe some kind of way
[1:34:20.040 --> 1:34:23.040]  where you could give a thumbs down to a notification
[1:34:23.040 --> 1:34:25.040]  that gets through that you really didn't want,
[1:34:25.040 --> 1:34:28.040]  and conversely on your phone
[1:34:28.040 --> 1:34:30.040]  to give a thumbs up to a notification
[1:34:30.040 --> 1:34:33.040]  that was only on your phone and didn't go to your wrist,
[1:34:33.040 --> 1:34:34.040]  to say, oh, this was good.
[1:34:34.040 --> 1:34:36.040]  I wish that this had gone to my wrist,
[1:34:36.040 --> 1:34:37.040]  and then it could run.
[1:34:37.040 --> 1:34:39.040]  Right, it needs a little bit of that feedback for sure.
[1:34:39.040 --> 1:34:41.040]  And I don't think, I don't think.
[1:34:41.040 --> 1:34:43.040]  I mean, that's how Google's learning, right?
[1:34:43.040 --> 1:34:46.040]  I mean, they know what we favor it.
[1:34:46.040 --> 1:34:48.040]  That's part of what they do,
[1:34:48.040 --> 1:34:52.040]  and if I move something from whatever they call it,
[1:34:52.040 --> 1:34:57.040]  my promotions, the updates, updates is one of the things
[1:34:57.040 --> 1:34:59.040]  that they sometimes don't get right.
[1:34:59.040 --> 1:35:01.040]  They'll put things that are important to me
[1:35:01.040 --> 1:35:03.040]  and updates in that filter,
[1:35:03.040 --> 1:35:04.040]  and I drag it.
[1:35:04.040 --> 1:35:07.040]  They automatically start putting things there.
[1:35:07.040 --> 1:35:10.040]  Do you keep the notifications indicator on?
[1:35:10.040 --> 1:35:12.040]  It's that red dot at the top?
[1:35:12.040 --> 1:35:16.040]  I do, but this is part of this piece I might want to write
[1:35:16.040 --> 1:35:17.040]  for next week.
[1:35:17.040 --> 1:35:19.040]  That thing can control your life.
[1:35:19.040 --> 1:35:21.040]  I look down and I'm like, oh,
[1:35:21.040 --> 1:35:23.040]  it's sort of like that.
[1:35:23.040 --> 1:35:25.040]  To me, it reminds me of the blinking red dot
[1:35:25.040 --> 1:35:27.040]  from the blackberry agent.
[1:35:27.040 --> 1:35:29.040]  That was exactly what I was going to ask you
[1:35:29.040 --> 1:35:32.040]  as a known former recovering.
[1:35:32.040 --> 1:35:34.040]  It is, and it's like, I got a look.
[1:35:34.040 --> 1:35:35.040]  I got to look.
[1:35:35.040 --> 1:35:37.040]  Like, even though it's probably not something
[1:35:37.040 --> 1:35:39.040]  I care about at all, I need to look.
[1:35:39.040 --> 1:35:41.040]  Now, I've never been a blackberry user,
[1:35:41.040 --> 1:35:45.040]  but I know enough that the idea is that
[1:35:45.040 --> 1:35:47.040]  blackberries had a physical red LED,
[1:35:47.040 --> 1:35:50.040]  and it would blink if you had new messages.
[1:35:50.040 --> 1:35:53.040]  And then your blackberry was blinking red.
[1:35:53.040 --> 1:35:55.040]  You could leave it on your desk or something,
[1:35:55.040 --> 1:35:56.040]  and you could walk away and you come back
[1:35:56.040 --> 1:35:57.040]  and there's blinking red.
[1:35:57.040 --> 1:36:00.040]  You pick up your blackberry and you see what is it.
[1:36:00.040 --> 1:36:03.040]  And I remember when in that era
[1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:05.040]  when blackberry users were switching
[1:36:05.040 --> 1:36:09.040]  to Android phones and iPhones,
[1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:12.040]  that the thing that I kept seeing over and over again
[1:36:12.040 --> 1:36:14.040]  is I don't know what to do without that red light.
[1:36:14.040 --> 1:36:17.040]  God, I don't even want to tell Apple
[1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:19.040]  how much more money I would spend for
[1:36:19.040 --> 1:36:22.040]  an otherwise identical iPhone with a blinking red light.
[1:36:22.040 --> 1:36:24.040]  I heard that from so many people
[1:36:24.040 --> 1:36:25.040]  and you probably did too,
[1:36:25.040 --> 1:36:27.040]  because you're a known sympathizer
[1:36:27.040 --> 1:36:29.040]  to the blackberry addict cause.
[1:36:29.040 --> 1:36:32.040]  I can see why though now with this watch,
[1:36:32.040 --> 1:36:35.040]  like I still have it on, but I'm thinking.
[1:36:35.040 --> 1:36:37.040]  By the way, I still think that red light
[1:36:37.040 --> 1:36:40.040]  on an iPhone would save a lot of battery life.
[1:36:40.040 --> 1:36:41.040]  I see the appeal of it.
[1:36:41.040 --> 1:36:43.040]  To me, it's the exact equivalent
[1:36:43.040 --> 1:36:48.040]  of the ringer switch on the iPhone,
[1:36:48.040 --> 1:36:50.040]  which most phones don't come with.
[1:36:50.040 --> 1:36:52.040]  Most like Android phones don't have
[1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:54.040]  a dedicated on-off ringer switch,
[1:36:54.040 --> 1:36:55.040]  and I don't know what I would do without that.
[1:36:55.040 --> 1:36:57.040]  I love my ringer switch.
[1:36:57.040 --> 1:36:59.040]  It would drive me, in fact,
[1:36:59.040 --> 1:37:02.040]  when I do try using phones other than the iPhone,
[1:37:02.040 --> 1:37:05.040]  like I have the second gen Moto X here.
[1:37:05.040 --> 1:37:08.040]  Honest to God, I think my single biggest complaint
[1:37:08.040 --> 1:37:10.040]  about it is that it doesn't have a ringer switch.
[1:37:10.040 --> 1:37:12.040]  Above and beyond, all of the things
[1:37:12.040 --> 1:37:16.040]  that I would prefer about iOS versus
[1:37:16.040 --> 1:37:20.040]  Android and the physical hardware of the phone,
[1:37:20.040 --> 1:37:21.040]  et cetera, et cetera.
[1:37:21.040 --> 1:37:22.040]  The thing that just drives me nuts
[1:37:22.040 --> 1:37:24.040]  is that I can't just silence it without turning it on,
[1:37:24.040 --> 1:37:26.040]  and I know that there's a quick way to do it
[1:37:26.040 --> 1:37:29.040]  from the top, you go down, and it's a couple of taps.
[1:37:29.040 --> 1:37:31.040]  But I'm just addicted to the way that I can
[1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:34.040]  just turn it on and off without even looking at it.
[1:37:34.040 --> 1:37:37.040]  And to me, in that same way,
[1:37:37.040 --> 1:37:39.040]  that's what the blinking red light on the BlackBerry was.
[1:37:39.040 --> 1:37:42.040]  It was a way of saying, we're just going to put this
[1:37:42.040 --> 1:37:44.040]  on the device, we're going to make it a hardware feature,
[1:37:44.040 --> 1:37:46.040]  not a software feature, that you can tell
[1:37:46.040 --> 1:37:48.040]  if there's something new.
[1:37:48.040 --> 1:37:50.040]  Yeah, I'm looking at it,
[1:37:50.040 --> 1:37:52.040]  I don't think I really ever use the ringer.
[1:37:52.040 --> 1:37:54.040]  Oh my God, are you crazy?
[1:37:54.040 --> 1:37:55.040]  Do you leave it on, or do you leave it off?
[1:37:55.040 --> 1:37:57.040]  I leave it on.
[1:37:57.040 --> 1:38:00.040]  So you always have sounds coming from your iPhone.
[1:38:00.040 --> 1:38:02.040]  Pretty much.
[1:38:02.040 --> 1:38:03.040]  I would...
[1:38:03.040 --> 1:38:06.040]  Unless I'm doing, like, going to something
[1:38:06.040 --> 1:38:08.040]  and I use it, or just silence it.
[1:38:08.040 --> 1:38:10.040]  And now, see, I keep it silence
[1:38:10.040 --> 1:38:12.040]  because otherwise I feel like I'm getting bombarded
[1:38:12.040 --> 1:38:14.040]  with sounds all the time.
[1:38:14.040 --> 1:38:16.040]  I like to have it off.
[1:38:16.040 --> 1:38:19.040]  I mean, honestly, you know when I really only check it,
[1:38:19.040 --> 1:38:21.040]  I use this to check to make sure I'm getting,
[1:38:21.040 --> 1:38:24.040]  like my alarm's going to go off in the morning.
[1:38:24.040 --> 1:38:27.040]  Well, I see that's, you know,
[1:38:27.040 --> 1:38:30.040]  not everybody is addicted to everything, right?
[1:38:30.040 --> 1:38:33.040]  It's like, but to me, like, it's incomprehensible
[1:38:33.040 --> 1:38:35.040]  to me that every phone doesn't come with a switch like this.
[1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:37.040]  And I, as the time has gone on,
[1:38:37.040 --> 1:38:38.040]  it's my least favorite thing
[1:38:38.040 --> 1:38:40.040]  about the current generation of iPads
[1:38:40.040 --> 1:38:43.040]  where they got rid of that switch.
[1:38:43.040 --> 1:38:45.040]  And I know other people use it,
[1:38:45.040 --> 1:38:46.040]  it was like you can figure it on the iPads
[1:38:46.040 --> 1:38:49.040]  to be either a rotation lock or a sound lock,
[1:38:49.040 --> 1:38:50.040]  but I kept it to sound lock.
[1:38:50.040 --> 1:38:52.040]  Yes, that's what I used to use it as.
[1:38:52.040 --> 1:38:55.040]  I still kept it as sound lock.
[1:38:55.040 --> 1:38:56.040]  Yeah.
[1:38:56.040 --> 1:38:58.040]  Yeah, no, I love this little,
[1:38:58.040 --> 1:39:00.040]  I mean, I hate this little red button,
[1:39:00.040 --> 1:39:01.040]  but I hate, I love it also.
[1:39:01.040 --> 1:39:03.040]  I've got to turn it off, I think.
[1:39:03.040 --> 1:39:06.040]  Yeah, I kind of think I'm going to end up turning it off
[1:39:06.040 --> 1:39:07.040]  in the long run.
[1:39:07.040 --> 1:39:09.040]  And just, yeah, I'll just check by swiping down
[1:39:09.040 --> 1:39:12.040]  to see if there are notifications that I, you know,
[1:39:12.040 --> 1:39:14.040]  that are still pending.
[1:39:14.040 --> 1:39:16.040]  Yeah, I mean, that's like one thing too.
[1:39:16.040 --> 1:39:19.040]  Like, does this, I have to clean these all out,
[1:39:19.040 --> 1:39:22.040]  does this mimic the notification tray on your phone?
[1:39:22.040 --> 1:39:24.040]  It does, right?
[1:39:24.040 --> 1:39:26.040]  I think so, except the one on your phone
[1:39:26.040 --> 1:39:30.040]  can have more because some of them don't go through.
[1:39:30.040 --> 1:39:33.040]  Yeah, I wish there was a way to clear these all.
[1:39:33.040 --> 1:39:35.040]  You're a force touch it.
[1:39:35.040 --> 1:39:38.040]  Oh, no, is this a secret force touch?
[1:39:38.040 --> 1:39:39.040]  Yeah.
[1:39:39.040 --> 1:39:41.040]  Oh, my God.
[1:39:41.040 --> 1:39:43.040]  This is the craziest thing to me.
[1:39:43.040 --> 1:39:45.040]  Secret force touch is,
[1:39:45.040 --> 1:39:50.040]  like, a mind-bending thing.
[1:39:50.040 --> 1:39:52.040]  I've just changed the right things.
[1:39:52.040 --> 1:39:55.040]  You find things that are just not,
[1:39:55.040 --> 1:39:56.040]  you would never have known,
[1:39:56.040 --> 1:39:59.040]  you would have never thought to force touch on that menu.
[1:39:59.040 --> 1:40:01.040]  I never would have thought to force touch on the notification
[1:40:01.040 --> 1:40:02.040]  menu.
[1:40:02.040 --> 1:40:04.040]  Just like I was on the Vergecast last week,
[1:40:04.040 --> 1:40:07.040]  I would have never thought to force touch on the emojis.
[1:40:07.040 --> 1:40:11.040]  To change, you can change like the Pac-Man smiley guy
[1:40:11.040 --> 1:40:14.040]  to a red face Pac-Man smiley guy.
[1:40:14.040 --> 1:40:16.040]  You can change the hearts to purple.
[1:40:16.040 --> 1:40:17.040]  Right.
[1:40:17.040 --> 1:40:19.040]  You can get a purple heart on this thing.
[1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:21.040]  That is my tip.
[1:40:21.040 --> 1:40:23.040]  I know that it's, you know, 10 days away,
[1:40:23.040 --> 1:40:26.040]  10, two weeks away from everybody out there getting their apple
[1:40:26.040 --> 1:40:27.040]  watches.
[1:40:27.040 --> 1:40:28.040]  I'm telling you, my number,
[1:40:28.040 --> 1:40:30.040]  if there's one thing you remember from this episode of the show,
[1:40:30.040 --> 1:40:31.040]  when you get your apple watch,
[1:40:31.040 --> 1:40:34.040]  don't forget to try force tap everywhere you go.
[1:40:34.040 --> 1:40:36.040]  No, force touch everything.
[1:40:36.040 --> 1:40:39.040]  Just force touch every single thing on the watch.
[1:40:39.040 --> 1:40:41.040]  So force touching notification center,
[1:40:41.040 --> 1:40:43.040]  or I don't know what they call it, if they call it.
[1:40:43.040 --> 1:40:44.040]  But when you come,
[1:40:44.040 --> 1:40:45.040]  this is my change.
[1:40:45.040 --> 1:40:46.040]  This is like completely what I've changed.
[1:40:46.040 --> 1:40:49.040]  You come down from the top and force touch
[1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:51.040]  and you get one button, clear all,
[1:40:51.040 --> 1:40:52.040]  and they all go away.
[1:40:52.040 --> 1:40:53.040]  So let me tell you this,
[1:40:53.040 --> 1:40:55.040]  I'm so addicted to that that I've started doing it on my phone
[1:40:55.040 --> 1:40:57.040]  because one of the things that,
[1:40:57.040 --> 1:40:59.040]  and it's a long-standing complaint a lot of people have
[1:40:59.040 --> 1:41:00.040]  is on the iPhone,
[1:41:00.040 --> 1:41:02.040]  you can't clear all of your notifications.
[1:41:02.040 --> 1:41:04.040]  You can only do it at my app.
[1:41:04.040 --> 1:41:05.040]  You have to hit the app.
[1:41:05.040 --> 1:41:07.040]  And you have to hit clear again,
[1:41:07.040 --> 1:41:09.040]  and then you have to hit the next text then clear.
[1:41:09.040 --> 1:41:11.040]  So I just, I've started force touching my phone,
[1:41:11.040 --> 1:41:13.040]  thinking that I can clear all,
[1:41:13.040 --> 1:41:15.040]  because I clear all on my website all the time.
[1:41:15.040 --> 1:41:17.040]  We're pretty sure force touch is coming to the phone, right?
[1:41:17.040 --> 1:41:18.040]  I mean, it seems like.
[1:41:18.040 --> 1:41:20.040]  Yeah, but here's the big,
[1:41:20.040 --> 1:41:22.040]  we could go on and on about this,
[1:41:22.040 --> 1:41:24.040]  but here's my question about it with the phone,
[1:41:24.040 --> 1:41:27.040]  is we have two devices with force touch.
[1:41:27.040 --> 1:41:30.040]  And I want to talk to you about the MacBook too,
[1:41:30.040 --> 1:41:32.040]  and we can get to it there.
[1:41:32.040 --> 1:41:34.040]  So we have the new MacBook,
[1:41:34.040 --> 1:41:35.040]  which has the force touch trackpad,
[1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:36.040]  and we have the watch,
[1:41:36.040 --> 1:41:38.040]  which has force touch on this little time screen.
[1:41:38.040 --> 1:41:41.040]  On the watch, force touch,
[1:41:41.040 --> 1:41:43.040]  the whole screen is just effectively a button.
[1:41:43.040 --> 1:41:45.040]  It doesn't matter where you force touch.
[1:41:45.040 --> 1:41:48.040]  It's just, it's either a force tap or not a force tap,
[1:41:48.040 --> 1:41:49.040]  and that's it.
[1:41:49.040 --> 1:41:51.040]  A regular tap has location like a touch screen.
[1:41:51.040 --> 1:41:55.040]  If you tap hard, it's just a force tap, doesn't matter where.
[1:41:55.040 --> 1:41:58.040]  So you can't force tap on a thing, on the watch.
[1:41:58.040 --> 1:42:01.040]  And I think that makes sense because it's so small.
[1:42:01.040 --> 1:42:04.040]  On the trackpad, obviously, it's very, very precise,
[1:42:04.040 --> 1:42:07.040]  and you get the tactic feedback,
[1:42:07.040 --> 1:42:09.040]  exactly where your finger is.
[1:42:09.040 --> 1:42:12.040]  So I think it's definitely coming to the iPhone.
[1:42:12.040 --> 1:42:15.040]  I think it's coming to the iPad eventually.
[1:42:15.040 --> 1:42:18.040]  If not this year, it'll be just one more year.
[1:42:18.040 --> 1:42:22.040]  But my question is, is on these phones and tablets,
[1:42:22.040 --> 1:42:24.040]  is it going to be like precise,
[1:42:24.040 --> 1:42:26.040]  or is it going to be like the watch,
[1:42:26.040 --> 1:42:28.040]  where it's like you've just force tapped,
[1:42:28.040 --> 1:42:29.040]  and that's it.
[1:42:29.040 --> 1:42:32.040]  And it doesn't matter where your finger is on the screen.
[1:42:32.040 --> 1:42:36.040]  I think it's going to be precise depending on the screen size, right?
[1:42:36.040 --> 1:42:40.040]  I think like on the MacBook, you can force touch on a word.
[1:42:40.040 --> 1:42:43.040]  And that's very precise.
[1:42:43.040 --> 1:42:50.040]  So I could see that also being an option on the iPhone, right?
[1:42:50.040 --> 1:42:55.040]  Like if I force touched on instead of double tapped on a word,
[1:42:55.040 --> 1:42:57.040]  maybe something else would happen.
[1:42:57.040 --> 1:43:00.040]  I mean, I definitely want it to work that way on my iPhone.
[1:43:00.040 --> 1:43:03.040]  I want it to be like precise so I can force tap on a word,
[1:43:03.040 --> 1:43:06.040]  but I just wonder whether I'm setting myself up for disappointment,
[1:43:06.040 --> 1:43:09.040]  because engineering-wise, like, right,
[1:43:09.040 --> 1:43:12.040]  they can make the trackpad so that the trackpad
[1:43:12.040 --> 1:43:15.040]  isn't underneath the trackpad is entirely set up
[1:43:15.040 --> 1:43:17.040]  as a haptic feedback thing.
[1:43:17.040 --> 1:43:21.040]  But there may not be it because the phone,
[1:43:21.040 --> 1:43:24.040]  all there is is the screen, effectively.
[1:43:24.040 --> 1:43:27.040]  They may not have the room to make the whole thing,
[1:43:27.040 --> 1:43:29.040]  you know, precisely, taptic.
[1:43:29.040 --> 1:43:30.040]  I don't know.
[1:43:30.040 --> 1:43:32.040]  I might be setting myself up for disappointment there.
[1:43:32.040 --> 1:43:34.040]  So I'm not letting myself get to that.
[1:43:34.040 --> 1:43:36.040]  Yeah, I guess I know that I think about it, too.
[1:43:36.040 --> 1:43:39.040]  But yeah, it certainly, like, I would be very happy
[1:43:39.040 --> 1:43:41.040]  to force touch on the notifications clear all.
[1:43:41.040 --> 1:43:42.040]  Right.
[1:43:42.040 --> 1:43:45.040]  You know what I'd be also really happy for?
[1:43:45.040 --> 1:43:47.040]  Apple, if you are listening to this podcast.
[1:43:47.040 --> 1:43:52.040]  I want to force touch in Control Center
[1:43:52.040 --> 1:43:55.040]  on the wireless command, the little wireless circle,
[1:43:55.040 --> 1:43:58.040]  and I want to go to the settings menu.
[1:43:58.040 --> 1:44:01.040]  And there I want to be able, the wireless settings menu.
[1:44:01.040 --> 1:44:04.040]  And I want to be able to get to Wi-Fi.
[1:44:04.040 --> 1:44:05.040]  Oh.
[1:44:05.040 --> 1:44:06.040]  Okay.
[1:44:06.040 --> 1:44:07.040]  That's a request.
[1:44:07.040 --> 1:44:08.040]  So you go from Control Center.
[1:44:08.040 --> 1:44:09.040]  Force touch on the look.
[1:44:09.040 --> 1:44:12.040]  I hate that I can't get to settings from Control Center.
[1:44:12.040 --> 1:44:14.040]  I see what you mean, where you would just.
[1:44:14.040 --> 1:44:16.040]  I want to test it to toggle it on and off,
[1:44:16.040 --> 1:44:18.040]  but do a force touch on it,
[1:44:18.040 --> 1:44:20.040]  and then jump to the settings for Bluetooth.
[1:44:20.040 --> 1:44:21.040]  Yes.
[1:44:21.040 --> 1:44:22.040]  That is it.
[1:44:22.040 --> 1:44:25.040]  That is, I would be very, very, I would be so happy.
[1:44:25.040 --> 1:44:26.040]  Yeah, that would make a lot of sense.
[1:44:26.040 --> 1:44:27.040]  And then you could do it like with all of them,
[1:44:27.040 --> 1:44:29.040]  because you could do it with do not disturb
[1:44:29.040 --> 1:44:31.040]  and instead of just turning it on or off,
[1:44:31.040 --> 1:44:33.040]  you would jump to your do not disturb settings
[1:44:33.040 --> 1:44:36.040]  and you could change like the time that it scheduled for.
[1:44:36.040 --> 1:44:37.040]  Right.
[1:44:37.040 --> 1:44:39.040]  I mean, most of the time when I'm turning on and off Wi-Fi,
[1:44:39.040 --> 1:44:40.040]  it's true.
[1:44:40.040 --> 1:44:42.040]  I'm just getting on my home network
[1:44:42.040 --> 1:44:43.040]  or whatever for some reason.
[1:44:43.040 --> 1:44:44.040]  I turned off Wi-Fi.
[1:44:44.040 --> 1:44:45.040]  I don't know.
[1:44:45.040 --> 1:44:46.040]  It was slow or something someplace and I turned it off.
[1:44:46.040 --> 1:44:49.040]  But a lot of the time, I'm also going to someplace
[1:44:49.040 --> 1:44:52.040]  and I want to get on a new Wi-Fi network.
[1:44:52.040 --> 1:44:56.040]  And I just want to get to the Wi-Fi settings
[1:44:56.040 --> 1:44:58.040]  and it's a whole other step.
[1:44:58.040 --> 1:45:01.040]  I've got to go into settings and I got to hit Wi-Fi.
[1:45:01.040 --> 1:45:02.040]  And yes, I know.
[1:45:02.040 --> 1:45:03.040]  Crimey River.
[1:45:03.040 --> 1:45:06.040]  It's three taps, but two taps, but it's a request.
[1:45:06.040 --> 1:45:09.040]  I have two things I want to talk about still before we wrap up.
[1:45:09.040 --> 1:45:12.040]  I want to talk about third party apps on the watch
[1:45:12.040 --> 1:45:14.040]  and I want to talk about the new MacBook.
[1:45:14.040 --> 1:45:18.040]  Do you have anything else that's like a must talk about?
[1:45:18.040 --> 1:45:21.040]  I think we could easily fill up our remaining time with that.
[1:45:21.040 --> 1:45:22.040]  All right.
[1:45:22.040 --> 1:45:24.040]  Before we get started with either, let me just thank.
[1:45:24.040 --> 1:45:25.040]  And this puppy is still sleeping.
[1:45:25.040 --> 1:45:26.040]  He's been sleeping the whole podcast.
[1:45:26.040 --> 1:45:29.040]  That's how bored he is of me.
[1:45:29.040 --> 1:45:31.040]  He's so bored by this conversation.
[1:45:31.040 --> 1:45:34.040]  I had a boyhood family dog.
[1:45:34.040 --> 1:45:36.040]  I think I was in second grade when we got him.
[1:45:36.040 --> 1:45:37.040]  His name was Chester.
[1:45:37.040 --> 1:45:40.040]  And I loved him as much as I've ever loved any living being
[1:45:40.040 --> 1:45:43.040]  on this planet just about.
[1:45:43.040 --> 1:45:46.040]  And he slept 23 hours a day.
[1:45:46.040 --> 1:45:48.040]  I think as a puppy.
[1:45:48.040 --> 1:45:49.040]  And then even as an adult,
[1:45:49.040 --> 1:45:52.040]  I think he probably slept about 21 hours a day.
[1:45:52.040 --> 1:45:54.040]  But I was so, I was pretty upset.
[1:45:54.040 --> 1:45:58.040]  Because I thought he would be playing with me nonstop all the time.
[1:45:58.040 --> 1:45:59.040]  I thought so too.
[1:45:59.040 --> 1:46:02.040]  I've been home for the last, I took off for,
[1:46:02.040 --> 1:46:03.040]  I just don't have a column this week.
[1:46:03.040 --> 1:46:05.040]  And I was like, oh, I'm going to play with him all day.
[1:46:05.040 --> 1:46:06.040]  He sleeps all day.
[1:46:06.040 --> 1:46:08.040]  And I keep, I keep asking my wife, I think he's depressed.
[1:46:08.040 --> 1:46:09.040]  I think he's depressed.
[1:46:09.040 --> 1:46:11.040]  I think we need to take hip step place.
[1:46:11.040 --> 1:46:12.040]  No.
[1:46:12.040 --> 1:46:13.040]  She's like, no, he's a puppy.
[1:46:13.040 --> 1:46:14.040]  Yeah.
[1:46:14.040 --> 1:46:15.040]  He sleeps all day.
[1:46:15.040 --> 1:46:16.040]  That's what he's going to do.
[1:46:16.040 --> 1:46:19.040]  And I'm like, no, I think he's got, I think he's upset.
[1:46:19.040 --> 1:46:20.040]  Nope.
[1:46:20.040 --> 1:46:22.040]  That is, that's what they do.
[1:46:22.040 --> 1:46:23.040]  It's kind of awesome.
[1:46:23.040 --> 1:46:27.040]  If you think about it, they're, they're living the life.
[1:46:27.040 --> 1:46:28.040]  Did you get the week off?
[1:46:28.040 --> 1:46:31.040]  Just to go, to go meta for a second, did you get the week off?
[1:46:31.040 --> 1:46:37.040]  Because you did the Apple Watch review and the MacBook review at the same time,
[1:46:37.040 --> 1:46:38.040]  which I see.
[1:46:38.040 --> 1:46:39.040]  Yes.
[1:46:39.040 --> 1:46:41.040]  And then I decided to get a puppy like the day after.
[1:46:41.040 --> 1:46:44.040]  So I barely slept for a, for a very long time.
[1:46:44.040 --> 1:46:47.040]  But yes, I did, I did get the week off for that reason.
[1:46:47.040 --> 1:46:51.040]  I forget how many words long my Apple Watch review was,
[1:46:51.040 --> 1:46:53.040]  which didn't really go through the software.
[1:46:53.040 --> 1:46:55.040]  And it was still many, many thousands of words.
[1:46:55.040 --> 1:46:59.040]  And when I was done, I really felt like I needed to check myself into,
[1:46:59.040 --> 1:47:02.040]  like a spa or something and recuperate.
[1:47:02.040 --> 1:47:08.040]  And meantime, you had, I actually cannot believe that you reviewed both at the same time.
[1:47:08.040 --> 1:47:10.040]  People emailed me and they were like, did you get the MacBook?
[1:47:10.040 --> 1:47:11.040]  You can have review.
[1:47:11.040 --> 1:47:13.040]  And I was like, no, I did not get the MacBook.
[1:47:13.040 --> 1:47:14.040]  I didn't want the MacBook.
[1:47:14.040 --> 1:47:17.040]  I'm exhausted having reviewed the Apple Watch.
[1:47:17.040 --> 1:47:18.040]  You did both.
[1:47:18.040 --> 1:47:23.040]  I, you know, that video took so much out of me that Apple Watch video,
[1:47:23.040 --> 1:47:26.040]  because I just never thought it would actually work.
[1:47:26.040 --> 1:47:28.040]  We spent like so much time thinking about it.
[1:47:28.040 --> 1:47:34.040]  And then like, I just so many hours editing and figuring out if this thing could come together
[1:47:34.040 --> 1:47:38.040]  to a piece that people would actually want to watch that we were there at the,
[1:47:38.040 --> 1:47:41.040]  I was at the office two or three nights in a row until 2 a.m.
[1:47:41.040 --> 1:47:44.040]  And then I was like, oh, yeah, and then this MacBook review.
[1:47:44.040 --> 1:47:47.040]  I salute you because I don't understand how you did it all.
[1:47:47.040 --> 1:47:49.040]  I don't understand how you did the video.
[1:47:49.040 --> 1:47:52.040]  And I don't understand how you did all three of the things and the MacBook.
[1:47:52.040 --> 1:47:55.040]  You had a good MacBook video too, but the Apple Watch video for those of you
[1:47:55.040 --> 1:47:57.040]  who haven't watched it, I'll put it in the show.
[1:47:57.040 --> 1:48:02.040]  But Joanna's Apple Watch video was truly first person.
[1:48:02.040 --> 1:48:07.040]  She literally put a helmet on that could support a, it looked like an SLR.
[1:48:07.040 --> 1:48:12.040]  I mean, it was, it was a, it's a 70 day, it's a Canon 70.
[1:48:12.040 --> 1:48:18.040]  So no crappy GoPro, it to an actual, I honestly, I watched the video first.
[1:48:18.040 --> 1:48:22.040]  And then at the end, there is like a third person shot that shows you shooting it.
[1:48:22.040 --> 1:48:24.040]  And I was like, at first I thought it was a joke.
[1:48:24.040 --> 1:48:27.040]  And then I thought, no, that explains why the quality was so great.
[1:48:27.040 --> 1:48:32.040]  The whole thing is, it's a day in the life of using Apple Watch shot literally
[1:48:32.040 --> 1:48:35.040]  from the first person perspective, you know, eyeball level.
[1:48:35.040 --> 1:48:40.040]  And the way she did it was by spending a day of her life with a helmet
[1:48:40.040 --> 1:48:43.040]  with a Canon 70D in front of her face.
[1:48:43.040 --> 1:48:44.040]  Yeah, it was insane.
[1:48:44.040 --> 1:48:46.040]  I mean, I wanted to do something different.
[1:48:46.040 --> 1:48:49.040]  Because I was like, everyone's going to have video reviews of this thing.
[1:48:49.040 --> 1:48:51.040]  I wanted to do something different.
[1:48:51.040 --> 1:48:55.040]  And my whole purpose was actually to like sort of do an anti Apple ad.
[1:48:55.040 --> 1:48:59.040]  Like this is what it's like to use in a real life and not on like a beautiful white background.
[1:48:59.040 --> 1:49:03.040]  And yeah, it just turned into this massive project.
[1:49:03.040 --> 1:49:05.040]  And one of the producers had done something similar.
[1:49:05.040 --> 1:49:09.040]  And I was like, so about this helmet camera, you think it's like,
[1:49:09.040 --> 1:49:11.040]  you think it's ready to go?
[1:49:11.040 --> 1:49:13.040]  And we just did it.
[1:49:13.040 --> 1:49:15.040]  I thought it was really worked well.
[1:49:15.040 --> 1:49:18.040]  And I thought the other thing too, here's the other thing though that amazes me.
[1:49:18.040 --> 1:49:23.040]  And I think it's because I'm a very slow worker.
[1:49:23.040 --> 1:49:27.040]  But to me that amazes me is that not just that you did this very production
[1:49:27.040 --> 1:49:32.040]  intensive video and footage intensive, right?
[1:49:32.040 --> 1:49:34.040]  Because you had to spend a whole day with the helmet on.
[1:49:34.040 --> 1:49:36.040]  So it took a long time to get all the footage.
[1:49:36.040 --> 1:49:38.040]  Clearly took a long time to edit.
[1:49:38.040 --> 1:49:46.040]  And you wrote a completely credible column reviewing it.
[1:49:46.040 --> 1:49:49.040]  And having used the watch myself,
[1:49:49.040 --> 1:49:51.040]  and I've watched the video and read your review,
[1:49:51.040 --> 1:49:56.040]  clearly you spent enough time using the watch to form a very informed opinion.
[1:49:56.040 --> 1:50:01.040]  So because that to me is part of the problem with these review schedules is that
[1:50:01.040 --> 1:50:05.040]  it takes so much time with the device before you can even start
[1:50:05.040 --> 1:50:10.040]  because you need the time to form a genuine opinion of it to understand it.
[1:50:10.040 --> 1:50:13.040]  I know and I think people were concerned also about the MacBook.
[1:50:13.040 --> 1:50:16.040]  I had the MacBook for two weeks.
[1:50:16.040 --> 1:50:19.040]  And that was a nice thing about both of these pieces.
[1:50:19.040 --> 1:50:23.040]  Look, we could have definitely used some more time on the watch in terms of the embargo time,
[1:50:23.040 --> 1:50:29.040]  but I had a week and a half and really hammered on that
[1:50:29.040 --> 1:50:32.040]  and then also used the MacBook as my main laptop to be the whole thing.
[1:50:32.040 --> 1:50:36.040]  So I had a good amount of time for testing.
[1:50:36.040 --> 1:50:40.040]  Battery life testing on MacBook can take quite a bit of time.
[1:50:40.040 --> 1:50:43.040]  And so I had a good amount of time for that.
[1:50:43.040 --> 1:50:46.040]  Your video, and this is the last thing on the video,
[1:50:46.040 --> 1:50:51.040]  it has a hilarious cameo from Rupert Murdoch.
[1:50:51.040 --> 1:50:53.040]  How in the world did you get that?
[1:50:53.040 --> 1:50:57.040]  All right, yeah, obviously some parts of the video were scripted.
[1:50:57.040 --> 1:50:59.040]  All right, okay.
[1:50:59.040 --> 1:51:02.040]  People have been like, so did you really just run into him?
[1:51:02.040 --> 1:51:05.040]  No, I didn't just run into Rupert with a huge helmet camera on,
[1:51:05.040 --> 1:51:08.040]  and was like, Rupert, could you steal my watch?
[1:51:08.040 --> 1:51:10.040]  Yeah, that was scripted.
[1:51:10.040 --> 1:51:11.040]  But he was totally gaming.
[1:51:11.040 --> 1:51:12.040]  He was great to work with on it.
[1:51:12.040 --> 1:51:14.040]  He was just like, okay, sure.
[1:51:14.040 --> 1:51:15.040]  Sounds like fun.
[1:51:15.040 --> 1:51:17.040]  He's always for me as having a great sense of humor.
[1:51:17.040 --> 1:51:18.040]  Yeah.
[1:51:18.040 --> 1:51:21.040]  And we didn't, I didn't say what to say.
[1:51:21.040 --> 1:51:23.040]  I was just like, we'll try it out.
[1:51:23.040 --> 1:51:26.040]  And he was the one who really ran with it.
[1:51:26.040 --> 1:51:29.040]  I died at that point.
[1:51:29.040 --> 1:51:30.040]  It was so funny.
[1:51:30.040 --> 1:51:32.040]  I was like, all right, all right, yeah, you can steal the watch.
[1:51:32.040 --> 1:51:33.040]  Totally.
[1:51:33.040 --> 1:51:36.040]  I mean, my idea was honestly just to run into him in the elevator,
[1:51:36.040 --> 1:51:38.040]  which actually does happen a lot.
[1:51:38.040 --> 1:51:41.040]  You know, we'll come up from doing a Fox News business hit
[1:51:41.040 --> 1:51:44.040]  and he'll be on the same floor and I'll say hi.
[1:51:44.040 --> 1:51:46.040]  But he was like, oh, no, no, sure.
[1:51:46.040 --> 1:51:48.040]  I'll do this.
[1:51:48.040 --> 1:51:49.040]  Yeah.
[1:51:49.040 --> 1:51:52.040]  I mean, also, I kept joking.
[1:51:52.040 --> 1:51:55.040]  Like, I sure, you know, it's not the Apple Watch edition.
[1:51:55.040 --> 1:51:58.040]  Is it good enough for you?
[1:51:58.040 --> 1:52:02.040]  Cause the roof of Murdoch is clearly among the people on the planet Earth
[1:52:02.040 --> 1:52:06.040]  where the difference between the edition and the regular Apple Watch is,
[1:52:06.040 --> 1:52:09.040]  well, whichever color I like better.
[1:52:09.040 --> 1:52:11.040]  Right, exactly.
[1:52:11.040 --> 1:52:12.040]  I thought it was great.
[1:52:12.040 --> 1:52:18.040]  And I really do think it also kind of, it kind of hammers home
[1:52:18.040 --> 1:52:23.040]  that the modern, the modernization of the Wall Street Journal culture.
[1:52:23.040 --> 1:52:25.040]  Like, it wasn't out of character.
[1:52:25.040 --> 1:52:29.040]  I think it's completely within the character of the style of reviews you guys do now.
[1:52:29.040 --> 1:52:31.040]  But I don't know.
[1:52:31.040 --> 1:52:35.040]  Having the publisher of the paper, you know, the famous publisher of the paper
[1:52:35.040 --> 1:52:38.040]  show up and then cameo in a review of a tech product.
[1:52:38.040 --> 1:52:40.040]  I thought it was great.
[1:52:40.040 --> 1:52:41.040]  Yeah.
[1:52:41.040 --> 1:52:44.040]  I mean, I tried, I wanted every scene to have a little bit of a purpose.
[1:52:44.040 --> 1:52:47.040]  Obviously, my sister saying, you know, I can't, can I first show?
[1:52:47.040 --> 1:52:48.040]  Yeah, you can totally push it.
[1:52:48.040 --> 1:52:49.040]  Yeah, you can totally push it.
[1:52:49.040 --> 1:52:51.040]  Yeah, you know, like fuck you to me.
[1:52:51.040 --> 1:52:55.040]  Like, you know, I thought that was, I thought it was fun, but also showed like
[1:52:55.040 --> 1:52:58.040]  a people are going to be really excited about getting this watch and be like
[1:52:58.040 --> 1:53:00.040]  making phone calls on it isn't actually totally stupid.
[1:53:00.040 --> 1:53:01.040]  Everybody should watch.
[1:53:01.040 --> 1:53:02.040]  It's funny.
[1:53:02.040 --> 1:53:03.040]  I'm not going to spoil it.
[1:53:03.040 --> 1:53:06.040]  Everyone, it's really funny the interpretation of that because I didn't
[1:53:06.040 --> 1:53:07.040]  editorialize so much.
[1:53:07.040 --> 1:53:09.040]  Like so many of my reviews, I basically am editorializing.
[1:53:09.040 --> 1:53:14.040]  I'll say buy or don't buy or, you know, this is, and that I didn't really
[1:53:14.040 --> 1:53:15.040]  editorialize so much.
[1:53:15.040 --> 1:53:18.040]  And so people have had different interpretations of it, which is great.
[1:53:18.040 --> 1:53:22.040]  I've had people email me and tweet saying, I've watched it three times, and I'm
[1:53:22.040 --> 1:53:27.040]  still not sure if you liked it or you didn't like it, which I kind of love.
[1:53:27.040 --> 1:53:30.040]  And I think, you know, certainly people have watched it and said, I'm definitely
[1:53:30.040 --> 1:53:31.040]  not buying one.
[1:53:31.040 --> 1:53:34.040]  And other people have said, oh, you made me want one so badly.
[1:53:34.040 --> 1:53:37.040]  You know, business insider completely ripped off the article and said, this is
[1:53:37.040 --> 1:53:40.040]  the reason you would not want to buy one or ripped off the video.
[1:53:40.040 --> 1:53:42.040]  And I just, yeah.
[1:53:42.040 --> 1:53:44.040]  I've had the same thing with my review.
[1:53:44.040 --> 1:53:47.040]  I have had people, I've had responses both ways.
[1:53:47.040 --> 1:53:49.040]  And people said, I was really on the fence.
[1:53:49.040 --> 1:53:50.040]  I was going to wait this out.
[1:53:50.040 --> 1:53:51.040]  Then I read your review.
[1:53:51.040 --> 1:53:52.040]  And I thought, screw it.
[1:53:52.040 --> 1:53:55.040]  I'm getting one at three o'clock in the morning, you know, the day they go on sale.
[1:53:55.040 --> 1:53:59.040]  And then I had other people, it just as many who said, I was totally set to buy one
[1:53:59.040 --> 1:54:00.040]  of these.
[1:54:00.040 --> 1:54:03.040]  And I read your review and I'm not buying one.
[1:54:03.040 --> 1:54:04.040]  I'm going to wait.
[1:54:04.040 --> 1:54:05.040]  I've had both responses.
[1:54:05.040 --> 1:54:09.040]  And I don't think that's ever happened with the product before that I can read.
[1:54:09.040 --> 1:54:10.040]  Yeah.
[1:54:10.040 --> 1:54:11.040]  And it wasn't just one or two.
[1:54:11.040 --> 1:54:14.040]  It was a solid half a dozen both ways.
[1:54:14.040 --> 1:54:15.040]  Yeah.
[1:54:15.040 --> 1:54:18.040]  And in the column, I was obviously a little more brilliant.
[1:54:18.040 --> 1:54:19.040]  I've told many friends.
[1:54:19.040 --> 1:54:21.040]  I don't think they should buy this.
[1:54:21.040 --> 1:54:23.040]  And then certainly many people read.
[1:54:23.040 --> 1:54:27.040]  And I've been getting tons of emails from people saying, do you think I should get this
[1:54:27.040 --> 1:54:28.040]  sport version?
[1:54:28.040 --> 1:54:30.040]  Do you think I should get this band?
[1:54:30.040 --> 1:54:34.040]  Lots of people read and said, yeah, you showed me the goods and the bads.
[1:54:34.040 --> 1:54:37.040]  And I'm deciding on yes or no or whatever.
[1:54:37.040 --> 1:54:38.040]  Yeah.
[1:54:38.040 --> 1:54:41.040]  I got the steel edition.
[1:54:41.040 --> 1:54:42.040]  I'm glad I did.
[1:54:42.040 --> 1:54:47.040]  But I kind of wish I had more time with the sport edition.
[1:54:47.040 --> 1:54:48.040]  But I think I know enough.
[1:54:48.040 --> 1:54:50.040]  And I've definitely, you know, I've seen enough.
[1:54:50.040 --> 1:54:54.040]  And I trust Apple, you know, and from that, what other people have tried it on.
[1:54:54.040 --> 1:54:55.040]  I've said.
[1:54:55.040 --> 1:55:00.040]  And the fact that I like those sport bands so much that I feel like anybody who's on the fence
[1:55:00.040 --> 1:55:01.040]  but kind of wants one.
[1:55:01.040 --> 1:55:04.040]  Just go ahead and get the sport one at the entry level price.
[1:55:04.040 --> 1:55:08.040]  And you're going to get a totally quality device.
[1:55:08.040 --> 1:55:10.040]  The digital crown feels great.
[1:55:10.040 --> 1:55:12.040]  The buttons great.
[1:55:12.040 --> 1:55:13.040]  Every bit is good.
[1:55:13.040 --> 1:55:16.040]  Build quality is Apple's other aluminum stuff like the phones.
[1:55:16.040 --> 1:55:19.040]  You're getting a totally great man.
[1:55:19.040 --> 1:55:21.040]  Yes, it's a rubber, it's a rubber wristband.
[1:55:21.040 --> 1:55:23.040]  But it's really, really good one.
[1:55:23.040 --> 1:55:24.040]  It really is.
[1:55:24.040 --> 1:55:26.040]  So don't worry about it.
[1:55:26.040 --> 1:55:30.040]  Like if you're on the fence at all, you know, and you can definitely swing the 350
[1:55:30.040 --> 1:55:32.040]  or 400 for the sport watch, just get it.
[1:55:32.040 --> 1:55:34.040]  And it's going to be, it's going to be fine.
[1:55:34.040 --> 1:55:37.040]  And especially if you're really just interested in playing with the platform.
[1:55:37.040 --> 1:55:43.040]  You're not getting a low tier device if you do it.
[1:55:43.040 --> 1:55:44.040]  But it's hard.
[1:55:44.040 --> 1:55:46.040]  It is a hard thing when people just want you to say,
[1:55:46.040 --> 1:55:47.040]  should I buy it or not?
[1:55:47.040 --> 1:55:51.040]  Because I do, it's, to me, I can't answer either way.
[1:55:51.040 --> 1:55:52.040]  I cannot just say yes or no.
[1:55:52.040 --> 1:55:54.040]  I can't wholeheartedly endorse it.
[1:55:54.040 --> 1:55:56.040]  But I can't trash it either.
[1:55:56.040 --> 1:55:57.040]  And I feel the business insider piece.
[1:55:57.040 --> 1:55:59.040]  Seven of those guys are jackasses.
[1:55:59.040 --> 1:56:02.040]  They're not.
[1:56:02.040 --> 1:56:04.040]  I thought that if there's any, you know,
[1:56:04.040 --> 1:56:06.040]  we all had different takes about what we like and what we didn't like.
[1:56:06.040 --> 1:56:11.040]  I thought that the consensus was clearly this is a very interesting 1.0.
[1:56:11.040 --> 1:56:16.040]  This is, it, there's some things that are definitely that they nailed,
[1:56:16.040 --> 1:56:18.040]  like the fitness tracking.
[1:56:18.040 --> 1:56:20.040]  And there's other stuff that is a question mark.
[1:56:20.040 --> 1:56:24.040]  And I thought, you know, I thought that was the consistency across the board.
[1:56:24.040 --> 1:56:27.040]  That it's, you know, maybe depends.
[1:56:27.040 --> 1:56:30.040]  It, you know, and you're not going to get a yes or no.
[1:56:30.040 --> 1:56:31.040]  Yeah.
[1:56:31.040 --> 1:56:36.040]  And I think this like an Apple's tagline for this was, is on the money.
[1:56:36.040 --> 1:56:39.040]  You know, this is the most personal product ever.
[1:56:39.040 --> 1:56:42.040]  It's very hard to review something so personal.
[1:56:42.040 --> 1:56:47.040]  It's very hard to, to, to review something that specifically fits into,
[1:56:47.040 --> 1:56:52.040]  I mean, that fits on your body and fits into your life in a very distinct way.
[1:56:52.040 --> 1:56:52.040]  Yeah.
[1:56:52.040 --> 1:56:55.040]  And I think it's really, it's really hard to do something to, to,
[1:56:55.040 --> 1:57:00.040]  to review something where a big part of the appeal is whether you just think it's cool or not.
[1:57:00.040 --> 1:57:01.040]  Or fun.
[1:57:01.040 --> 1:57:02.040]  Totally.
[1:57:02.040 --> 1:57:04.040]  So I tell you what, I, you know, I had to try it.
[1:57:04.040 --> 1:57:08.040]  And there's only a few stores that take, there's not that many stores that take Apple pay.
[1:57:08.040 --> 1:57:14.040]  But every time I use it at Whole Foods, every single time the cashier notices.
[1:57:14.040 --> 1:57:17.040]  And I'm not doing it in an ostentatious way.
[1:57:17.040 --> 1:57:23.040]  I'm, if anything, the introvert in me is trying to sort, not hide it, but do it as surreptitiously as possible.
[1:57:23.040 --> 1:57:27.040]  And I've paid with Apple pay at my phone, you know, ever since the thing came out.
[1:57:27.040 --> 1:57:30.040]  And I got a few comments about it when the phone first came out.
[1:57:30.040 --> 1:57:34.040]  But nothing like with the watch, with the watch, every single time they're like,
[1:57:34.040 --> 1:57:36.040]  oh my God, did you just do what I think you did?
[1:57:36.040 --> 1:57:37.040]  And I say yes.
[1:57:37.040 --> 1:57:40.040]  And then they're like, how did, you know, some of them know that the watch isn't out yet.
[1:57:40.040 --> 1:57:41.040]  And they say, how did you get it?
[1:57:41.040 --> 1:57:45.040]  Others, I had a cashier at Whole Foods who had no idea what Apple watch was.
[1:57:45.040 --> 1:57:48.040]  All she said was, did you just pay with your watch?
[1:57:48.040 --> 1:57:49.040]  And I said, yes.
[1:57:49.040 --> 1:57:51.040]  And she goes, that is so cool.
[1:57:51.040 --> 1:57:54.040]  And she, I mean, I could tell she did not know that it was an Apple watch.
[1:57:54.040 --> 1:57:58.040]  She didn't know the name of it. All she knew is that I paid for my groceries with my watch.
[1:57:58.040 --> 1:58:00.040]  And she said, that is so cool.
[1:58:00.040 --> 1:58:04.040]  See, I found the same thing, but I do ain't read.
[1:58:04.040 --> 1:58:07.040]  The woman behind the counter was like, that's an Apple watch.
[1:58:07.040 --> 1:58:12.040]  And to me, that showed the power of like the excitement about this thing.
[1:58:12.040 --> 1:58:14.040]  Well, she was like, I'm buying one, I'm buying one.
[1:58:14.040 --> 1:58:17.040]  But you haven't seen it.
[1:58:17.040 --> 1:58:18.040]  I'm buying one.
[1:58:18.040 --> 1:58:21.040]  But you, but you don't know about it.
[1:58:21.040 --> 1:58:25.040]  You know, it was like, she just was in awe of it.
[1:58:25.040 --> 1:58:26.040]  She said she was buying it.
[1:58:26.040 --> 1:58:29.040]  And of course, it was like the first time I had tried it there.
[1:58:29.040 --> 1:58:31.040]  So I wasn't really sure how to get Apple pay working.
[1:58:31.040 --> 1:58:33.040]  Now I obviously have no problem.
[1:58:33.040 --> 1:58:34.040]  I didn't, that's another thing.
[1:58:34.040 --> 1:58:36.040]  It's like not totally intuitive.
[1:58:36.040 --> 1:58:38.040]  You got to press the button twice.
[1:58:38.040 --> 1:58:39.040]  So I did this.
[1:58:39.040 --> 1:58:46.040]  Here's what I did is the first place where I used the Apple pay actually was in the Apple store.
[1:58:46.040 --> 1:58:53.040]  I had to, my mom's long story, but my mom broke her old iPad.
[1:58:53.040 --> 1:58:57.040]  And so I was going up for Easter and I thought, you know what,
[1:58:57.040 --> 1:59:00.040]  I'll just give her a Mother's Day gift or I'm going to get her a new iPad.
[1:59:00.040 --> 1:59:02.040]  It was long out of warranties.
[1:59:02.040 --> 1:59:04.040]  It was like an iPad too.
[1:59:04.040 --> 1:59:08.040]  So I used Apple pay to pay for an iPad for my mom.
[1:59:08.040 --> 1:59:11.040]  And I didn't know how it worked.
[1:59:11.040 --> 1:59:12.040]  And I didn't want to look it up.
[1:59:12.040 --> 1:59:14.040]  I really wanted to try to figure it out on my own.
[1:59:14.040 --> 1:59:17.040]  And I knew that I had configured the thing.
[1:59:17.040 --> 1:59:20.040]  You go through the phone to set up a credit card.
[1:59:20.040 --> 1:59:25.040]  It doesn't just transfer your Apple's, your existing cards over because it can't
[1:59:25.040 --> 1:59:29.040]  because when you set up a device for Apple pay, it's per device.
[1:59:29.040 --> 1:59:35.040]  That's part of the security, the privacy slash security of the way Apple pay works.
[1:59:35.040 --> 1:59:36.040]  It's per device.
[1:59:36.040 --> 1:59:41.040]  So in the same way that if you replace your iPhone, if it breaks and you replace it
[1:59:41.040 --> 1:59:46.040]  and you restore from backup, you have to set up your cards again because it's not part
[1:59:46.040 --> 1:59:49.040]  of the device storage where Apple pay gets stored.
[1:59:49.040 --> 1:59:51.040]  You have to set up your watch the same way.
[1:59:51.040 --> 1:59:54.040]  You do that though on the phone through the Apple pay app.
[1:59:54.040 --> 1:59:59.040]  You say I want to add a credit card and you can add the one from your iTunes account very easily
[1:59:59.040 --> 2:00:03.040]  or you can take a picture of a card just like when you set one up on your phone,
[2:00:03.040 --> 2:00:04.040]  but it's different.
[2:00:04.040 --> 2:00:07.040]  You can't just, you don't just get the ones that you have in your past book on your phone.
[2:00:07.040 --> 2:00:10.040]  So I knew I had set it up with a card.
[2:00:10.040 --> 2:00:13.040]  And I went to the Apple store and I didn't know how to set it up.
[2:00:13.040 --> 2:00:18.040]  And I remember from the event, he's something something about double clicking the button.
[2:00:18.040 --> 2:00:20.040]  But I figured that was how you confirm it.
[2:00:20.040 --> 2:00:24.040]  I thought it would be like the phone with a phone, you just wave it and then it says,
[2:00:24.040 --> 2:00:27.040]  okay, you want to pay this and then you do the touch ID and it goes through.
[2:00:27.040 --> 2:00:32.040]  So I figured I'll just wave my watch at the thing and it will come on
[2:00:32.040 --> 2:00:35.040]  and then I'll double tap that button.
[2:00:35.040 --> 2:00:38.040]  And the clerk at the Apple store was like,
[2:00:38.040 --> 2:00:40.040]  holy cow, how did you get that?
[2:00:40.040 --> 2:00:44.040]  You know, and it was, you know, I felt a little bit like a jerk
[2:00:44.040 --> 2:00:47.040]  and I wasn't trying to like, you know, lord it around.
[2:00:47.040 --> 2:00:49.040]  If anything again, the introvert and me was trying to like,
[2:00:49.040 --> 2:00:51.040]  hey, let's keep this down.
[2:00:51.040 --> 2:00:54.040]  I'm allowed to use it, you know, and they're like, right, right.
[2:00:54.040 --> 2:00:55.040]  You're allowed to do it.
[2:00:55.040 --> 2:00:56.040]  They want you to try it.
[2:00:56.040 --> 2:00:58.040]  But I was like, let's just keep it between us from now and then you can tell everybody
[2:00:58.040 --> 2:01:00.040]  that somebody came in here with a watch.
[2:01:00.040 --> 2:01:05.040]  Yeah, John, I hate to cut you off right now, but my puppy just pooped on the wee wee pad.
[2:01:05.040 --> 2:01:06.040]  Oh God.
[2:01:06.040 --> 2:01:07.040]  Please go.
[2:01:07.040 --> 2:01:10.040]  Eddie, Eddie, I'm so proud of him every time.
[2:01:10.040 --> 2:01:11.040]  I'll be back in two seconds.
[2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:12.040]  Don't edit this out.
[2:01:12.040 --> 2:01:13.040]  Don't edit this out.
[2:01:13.040 --> 2:01:15.040]  Come here.
[2:01:15.040 --> 2:01:18.040]  Come here.
[2:01:18.040 --> 2:01:20.040]  Good boy.
[2:01:20.040 --> 2:01:23.040]  Good boy.
[2:01:23.040 --> 2:01:24.040]  Good boy.
[2:01:24.040 --> 2:01:27.040]  You're such a good boy.
[2:01:27.040 --> 2:01:29.040]  Good boy.
[2:01:29.040 --> 2:01:31.040]  Hello.
[2:01:31.040 --> 2:01:32.040]  Hello.
[2:01:32.040 --> 2:01:33.040]  Hi.
[2:01:33.040 --> 2:01:35.040]  That was so great.
[2:01:35.040 --> 2:01:36.040]  Yeah.
[2:01:36.040 --> 2:01:38.040]  It's a big moment when this happens.
[2:01:38.040 --> 2:01:39.040]  No, that's.
[2:01:39.040 --> 2:01:42.040]  He's actually really, I don't want to, I don't want to say it too loud.
[2:01:42.040 --> 2:01:43.040]  So here's what I think he's a junior.
[2:01:43.040 --> 2:01:44.040]  Yeah, how can he be doing it?
[2:01:44.040 --> 2:01:47.040]  If he's only, if he's only been with you a week, how in the world is he already being?
[2:01:47.040 --> 2:01:48.040]  Oh, he's been in here.
[2:01:48.040 --> 2:01:49.040]  He's been with us for like three days.
[2:01:49.040 --> 2:01:50.040]  How's that possible?
[2:01:50.040 --> 2:01:52.040]  Yeah, he might be a genius.
[2:01:52.040 --> 2:01:53.040]  I know.
[2:01:53.040 --> 2:01:57.040]  And he's constantly going on the pad and we can't take him outside yet because when they're on
[2:01:57.040 --> 2:02:02.040]  the ground, you know, they're part of a, part of a, some, that's what this disease thing lives
[2:02:02.040 --> 2:02:07.040]  in the ground in New York City for dogs because there's so many dogs and he's not fully vaccinated
[2:02:07.040 --> 2:02:08.040]  so we can't go outside yet.
[2:02:08.040 --> 2:02:09.040]  Oh, I didn't know about that.
[2:02:09.040 --> 2:02:10.040]  Yeah.
[2:02:10.040 --> 2:02:11.040]  So that's why it's got to go inside.
[2:02:11.040 --> 2:02:15.040]  We don't want him, we don't want to train the dog to go inside, but we have to for the next
[2:02:15.040 --> 2:02:16.040]  five weeks because, oh, wow.
[2:02:16.040 --> 2:02:18.040]  Until he gets these shots, then he can go outside.
[2:02:18.040 --> 2:02:19.040]  Wow, that's weird.
[2:02:19.040 --> 2:02:20.040]  I had no idea.
[2:02:20.040 --> 2:02:21.040]  Yeah.
[2:02:21.040 --> 2:02:23.040]  It's like a New York's because there's so many dogs everywhere.
[2:02:23.040 --> 2:02:24.040]  Yeah.
[2:02:24.040 --> 2:02:28.040]  It lives in the dogs poop and pee, you know, so the other dog sees it and eats it or whatever.
[2:02:28.040 --> 2:02:30.040]  You know, it's.
[2:02:30.040 --> 2:02:33.040]  Apple pay at the Apple store.
[2:02:33.040 --> 2:02:34.040]  Yeah.
[2:02:34.040 --> 2:02:37.040]  And so you figured it out.
[2:02:37.040 --> 2:02:38.040]  Yeah.
[2:02:38.040 --> 2:02:46.040]  Well, you know, the clerk had the, the little hand reader and with the phone, you just put your phone up
[2:02:46.040 --> 2:02:50.040]  against theirs and then it initiates and I'm waving my Apple watch against the thing and
[2:02:50.040 --> 2:02:55.040]  nothing is happening and I'm like, oh man, I really wanted to try this out.
[2:02:55.040 --> 2:02:57.040]  And I guess I had tried, now I think about it.
[2:02:57.040 --> 2:03:01.040]  I had tried it at Whole Foods before and it didn't wake up and I thought, hmm.
[2:03:01.040 --> 2:03:07.040]  And it was, it was like, you know, the right before dinner, you know, six thirty, seven
[2:03:07.040 --> 2:03:09.040]  o'clock rush and I didn't want to hold the line.
[2:03:09.040 --> 2:03:10.040]  So I thought, I'll come back.
[2:03:10.040 --> 2:03:11.040]  I'm here all the time.
[2:03:11.040 --> 2:03:12.040]  I'll come back tomorrow.
[2:03:12.040 --> 2:03:14.040]  So this time at the Apple store though, I thought I got to figure this out.
[2:03:14.040 --> 2:03:19.040]  And that's only by trial and error that I figure out you got to do the double press first
[2:03:19.040 --> 2:03:22.040]  and then wave it against it.
[2:03:22.040 --> 2:03:27.040]  And, you know, I don't know if that's, I'm not even sure what the thinking is.
[2:03:27.040 --> 2:03:31.040]  I think the explanation is it lowers the battery life because then the NFC thing is only
[2:03:31.040 --> 2:03:33.040]  listening when you've double tapped.
[2:03:33.040 --> 2:03:37.040]  Whereas your phone is always listening for an NFC connection.
[2:03:37.040 --> 2:03:38.040]  I'm not quite sure.
[2:03:38.040 --> 2:03:41.040]  Or maybe it's, I don't know, but it is a little different.
[2:03:41.040 --> 2:03:42.040]  But then once you know it.
[2:03:42.040 --> 2:03:44.040]  Is it an often take authentication thing?
[2:03:44.040 --> 2:03:45.040]  Can I say that word?
[2:03:45.040 --> 2:03:46.040]  Yeah, maybe.
[2:03:46.040 --> 2:03:50.040]  Because, because on your phone you've got to hold down touch ID.
[2:03:50.040 --> 2:03:52.040]  Right.
[2:03:52.040 --> 2:03:54.040]  And on the watch, it's just a double tap.
[2:03:54.040 --> 2:03:57.040]  And so this, you know, having to put it in that mode first decreases the chance that someone
[2:03:57.040 --> 2:04:03.040]  could just sneak by your wrist and, you know, start an Apple pay, you know, connection.
[2:04:03.040 --> 2:04:05.040]  Once you know it, it's a cinch.
[2:04:05.040 --> 2:04:11.040]  And I have to say it is, I know it sounds so stupid and so lazy, but it's even easier than
[2:04:11.040 --> 2:04:13.040]  paying with your phone.
[2:04:13.040 --> 2:04:14.040]  I agree.
[2:04:14.040 --> 2:04:18.040]  First, I mean, it is a little awkward because you're like holding your wrist into a certain
[2:04:18.040 --> 2:04:22.040]  way, you know, you're flipping your wrist upside down, but it's so brief and it's so quick.
[2:04:22.040 --> 2:04:26.040]  It's, I've actually found, I think it's quicker than my iPhone because sometimes my iPhone
[2:04:26.040 --> 2:04:28.040]  has problems with touch ID now.
[2:04:28.040 --> 2:04:31.040]  I don't know if it's just a couple, you know, now that I've been using it so much,
[2:04:31.040 --> 2:04:37.040]  should I probably unlock my phone, you know, I think 100 times a day, whatever.
[2:04:37.040 --> 2:04:39.040]  That it seems faster than using my phone.
[2:04:39.040 --> 2:04:42.040]  I mean, also obviously you don't have to pull out your phone so that process is much
[2:04:42.040 --> 2:04:43.040]  faster as well.
[2:04:43.040 --> 2:04:44.040]  Yeah.
[2:04:44.040 --> 2:04:48.040]  Two is, we're still at the tail end of the winter season on the East Coast and so when I am
[2:04:48.040 --> 2:04:53.040]  out shopping, I'm wearing a coat and it's harder to get in my pocket to get the phone out,
[2:04:53.040 --> 2:04:54.040]  et cetera, et cetera.
[2:04:54.040 --> 2:04:55.040]  So Apple Pay is great.
[2:04:55.040 --> 2:04:56.040]  I think it's it.
[2:04:56.040 --> 2:05:02.040]  And I think it and it is absolutely positively a selling, a public selling point of the
[2:05:02.040 --> 2:05:06.040]  thing where people see you doing it in public and then they want to buy an Apple Watch.
[2:05:06.040 --> 2:05:11.040]  I mean, it's, it really sells the Apple Watch and it's the silliest thing.
[2:05:11.040 --> 2:05:14.040]  Dude, again, if so many of the reviews are like, do you need it?
[2:05:14.040 --> 2:05:15.040]  No.
[2:05:15.040 --> 2:05:16.040]  Of course not.
[2:05:16.040 --> 2:05:17.040]  You don't need any of this stuff.
[2:05:17.040 --> 2:05:18.040]  You know, you don't even need a watch to tell time.
[2:05:18.040 --> 2:05:20.040]  You can get, you know, you get the time from your phone.
[2:05:20.040 --> 2:05:23.040]  I mean, you don't need, there's not a single thing on it that you need.
[2:05:23.040 --> 2:05:25.040]  It's the wrong question to ask.
[2:05:25.040 --> 2:05:26.040]  And Apple Pay is right there.
[2:05:26.040 --> 2:05:28.040]  You do not need Apple Pay.
[2:05:28.040 --> 2:05:31.040]  But is it nice and is it cool then?
[2:05:31.040 --> 2:05:32.040]  Definitely.
[2:05:32.040 --> 2:05:33.040]  Right.
[2:05:33.040 --> 2:05:37.040]  No, I and that experience with that running thing.
[2:05:37.040 --> 2:05:42.040]  Basically in that whole, you know, 20 or 30 minutes of that experience,
[2:05:42.040 --> 2:05:46.040]  I was able to experience pretty much everything you can do without using your phone.
[2:05:46.040 --> 2:05:51.040]  And that's, you know, yes, more and more stuff will become separate from the phone.
[2:05:51.040 --> 2:05:56.040]  I think in future, whether it be in this generation or more generations, future generations of the product.
[2:05:56.040 --> 2:05:58.040]  And that's really freeing.
[2:05:58.040 --> 2:05:59.040]  Yeah.
[2:05:59.040 --> 2:06:00.040]  All right.
[2:06:00.040 --> 2:06:01.040]  Let me take the last break.
[2:06:01.040 --> 2:06:05.040]  We have a fourth sponsor and it's our good friends at Squarespace.

[2:06:23.040 --> 2:06:24.040]  You give it to them.
[2:06:24.040 --> 2:06:26.040]  And they give you an audio player.
[2:06:26.040 --> 2:06:27.040]  They create the RSS feed.

[2:06:31.040 --> 2:06:33.040]  You're, you have a store.

[2:06:37.040 --> 2:06:39.040]  Squarespace does e-commerce right out of the box.

[2:06:52.040 --> 2:06:54.040]  And the prices are really, really low.

[2:08:02.040 --> 2:08:04.040]  It's hard to even know where to get started.
[2:08:04.040 --> 2:08:06.040]  But they have stuff like splash pages now.
[2:08:06.040 --> 2:08:10.040]  Like if you want to set up a web page where you get like a front page
[2:08:10.040 --> 2:08:12.040]  that isn't really a home page.
[2:08:12.040 --> 2:08:14.040]  It's just like a promotional type thing that you click through
[2:08:14.040 --> 2:08:15.040]  and then you get to the real website.
[2:08:15.040 --> 2:08:17.040]  You can set that up now.
[2:08:17.040 --> 2:08:21.040]  All of the stuff that you do design-wise, it's so much more
[2:08:21.040 --> 2:08:24.040]  wizzy wig where when you're logged into your Squarespace account
[2:08:24.040 --> 2:08:27.040]  and you're looking at your own Squarespace site,
[2:08:27.040 --> 2:08:29.040]  if you see something, you're like, I want to get rid of that.
[2:08:29.040 --> 2:08:31.040]  I don't want to have my Twitter feed in the sidebar anymore
[2:08:31.040 --> 2:08:33.040]  or you want to add your Twitter feed to the sidebar
[2:08:33.040 --> 2:08:34.040]  or something like that.
[2:08:34.040 --> 2:08:37.040]  You just do it right there in the design and boom,
[2:08:37.040 --> 2:08:39.040]  it's there on your published website.
[2:08:39.040 --> 2:08:41.040]  So many good things.
[2:08:41.040 --> 2:08:44.040]  Really, just anything you might want to do with your own
[2:08:44.040 --> 2:08:47.040]  personal website or an organization website
[2:08:47.040 --> 2:08:48.040]  or even your company website.
[2:08:48.040 --> 2:08:49.040]  You can do it Squarespace.
[2:08:49.040 --> 2:08:51.040]  They even do domain name registration.
[2:08:51.040 --> 2:08:55.040]  So go check them out, go to squarespace.com slash Gruber,
[2:08:55.040 --> 2:08:58.040]  my last name, little confusing.
[2:08:58.040 --> 2:09:00.040]  I don't know, I don't know what the explanation is,
[2:09:00.040 --> 2:09:02.040]  but that way they know you came from the show,
[2:09:02.040 --> 2:09:05.040]  but just keep in mind that promo code JG saves you 10% off.
[2:09:05.040 --> 2:09:07.040]  So my thanks to Squarespace.
[2:09:07.040 --> 2:09:10.040]  All right, third party apps on Apple Watch.
[2:09:10.040 --> 2:09:12.040]  They suck.
[2:09:12.040 --> 2:09:14.040]  They suck.
[2:09:14.040 --> 2:09:15.040]  They're just slow.
[2:09:15.040 --> 2:09:17.040]  They're really, really slow.
[2:09:17.040 --> 2:09:20.040]  I mean, I actually wouldn't know if they suck
[2:09:20.040 --> 2:09:22.040]  because I've never really waited for one of them to load.
[2:09:22.040 --> 2:09:24.040]  Have you ever gotten to Uber to load?
[2:09:24.040 --> 2:09:25.040]  I got it to load.
[2:09:25.040 --> 2:09:27.040]  No, I've never gotten it to load.
[2:09:27.040 --> 2:09:30.040]  I got it to load one time and then it didn't do anything.
[2:09:30.040 --> 2:09:31.040]  And I talked to Neelai.
[2:09:31.040 --> 2:09:33.040]  Neelai said he was getting it to work one day,
[2:09:33.040 --> 2:09:37.040]  but it didn't tell him which side of the building
[2:09:37.040 --> 2:09:41.040]  it thought he was on and like the guy came to the other side
[2:09:41.040 --> 2:09:43.040]  of the, I guess the verge office has like a front entrance
[2:09:43.040 --> 2:09:45.040]  and a back entrance and the guy was like waiting at the other
[2:09:45.040 --> 2:09:47.040]  side because it just, you know,
[2:09:47.040 --> 2:09:48.040]  whereas you use it on your phone,
[2:09:48.040 --> 2:09:51.040]  it tells you exactly where it thinks it's going to pick you up.
[2:09:51.040 --> 2:09:53.040]  But everybody else, I know it's like,
[2:09:53.040 --> 2:09:55.040]  I can't believe that they publish the app.
[2:09:55.040 --> 2:09:57.040]  I know that they wanted apps in the app store
[2:09:57.040 --> 2:09:59.040]  so that those of us with review units
[2:09:59.040 --> 2:10:01.040]  could have some to try.
[2:10:01.040 --> 2:10:04.040]  But I can't believe the Uber one got through.
[2:10:04.040 --> 2:10:06.040]  Nobody gets it to work.
[2:10:06.040 --> 2:10:07.040]  It just sits there.
[2:10:07.040 --> 2:10:09.040]  Yeah, I'm pulsing blue.
[2:10:09.040 --> 2:10:11.040]  And that actually is another thing I did when I was setting
[2:10:11.040 --> 2:10:12.040]  up my watch.
[2:10:12.040 --> 2:10:14.040]  I kind of took off pretty much almost all these apps
[2:10:14.040 --> 2:10:17.040]  because I found my, I hate the app screen.
[2:10:17.040 --> 2:10:18.040]  I hate that screen.
[2:10:18.040 --> 2:10:20.040]  I can never accurately touch anything on here.
[2:10:20.040 --> 2:10:23.040]  The digital crown is really not very useful to me,
[2:10:23.040 --> 2:10:24.040]  to be honest.
[2:10:24.040 --> 2:10:28.040]  And so I just took off most of the apps on here.
[2:10:28.040 --> 2:10:30.040]  That's an interesting, it's an interesting complaint
[2:10:30.040 --> 2:10:32.040]  and I feel the same way.
[2:10:32.040 --> 2:10:35.040]  I feel like it is really hard to tap an individual icon
[2:10:35.040 --> 2:10:37.040]  and whether it's first party or third party,
[2:10:37.040 --> 2:10:39.040]  whether it's one of Apple's or not.
[2:10:39.040 --> 2:10:40.040]  Yeah.
[2:10:40.040 --> 2:10:43.040]  I kind of wish that the default size
[2:10:43.040 --> 2:10:45.040]  for the icons would be a little bigger.
[2:10:45.040 --> 2:10:47.040]  Like you can zoom in and zoom out,
[2:10:47.040 --> 2:10:49.040]  but when you're sort of, there's sort of
[2:10:49.040 --> 2:10:51.040]  as a default size where it settles in that.
[2:10:51.040 --> 2:10:54.040]  And I feel like it shows too many apps
[2:10:54.040 --> 2:10:57.040]  as opposed to showing fewer bigger apps
[2:10:57.040 --> 2:10:59.040]  to make them easier touch targets.
[2:10:59.040 --> 2:11:01.040]  I, I still too weak later.
[2:11:01.040 --> 2:11:05.040]  Like if I delete ones, why wouldn't it just become bigger?
[2:11:05.040 --> 2:11:09.040]  Like why, you know, as you delete these little icons,
[2:11:09.040 --> 2:11:10.040]  they don't become bigger.
[2:11:10.040 --> 2:11:12.040]  I just wish that as you zoom the crown
[2:11:12.040 --> 2:11:15.040]  that you could stop at a bigger spot
[2:11:15.040 --> 2:11:16.040]  and then it would stay there.
[2:11:16.040 --> 2:11:17.040]  I agree.
[2:11:17.040 --> 2:11:19.040]  As opposed to you make them a little bigger
[2:11:19.040 --> 2:11:22.040]  and then you let go and it just settles back.
[2:11:22.040 --> 2:11:24.040]  Totally agree, totally agree.
[2:11:24.040 --> 2:11:25.040]  Yeah.
[2:11:25.040 --> 2:11:29.040]  I can't help but think they're going to have to address this.
[2:11:29.040 --> 2:11:33.040]  It's really, it's, it's just too finicky.
[2:11:33.040 --> 2:11:36.040]  It's, you know, and it comes back to stuff
[2:11:36.040 --> 2:11:39.040]  that Apple even bragged about with the iPhone
[2:11:39.040 --> 2:11:43.040]  where they measured, you know, optimal touch sizes
[2:11:43.040 --> 2:11:45.040]  for average fingertips.
[2:11:45.040 --> 2:11:48.040]  And then, you know, knowing that the original iPhone
[2:11:48.040 --> 2:11:52.040]  was 163 pixels per inch,
[2:11:52.040 --> 2:11:56.040]  that means that the minimum, you know, touch size is 40
[2:11:56.040 --> 2:11:59.040]  and, you know, two different buttons
[2:11:59.040 --> 2:12:01.040]  should be at least this far apart
[2:12:01.040 --> 2:12:04.040]  to avoid accidentally touching one when you meant the other.
[2:12:04.040 --> 2:12:07.040]  And all those details of how many pixels it was
[2:12:07.040 --> 2:12:09.040]  and now with the retina screens it's all in points
[2:12:09.040 --> 2:12:12.040]  which are double the size but you can just deal with them the same way.
[2:12:12.040 --> 2:12:14.040]  You have to be a developer designer
[2:12:14.040 --> 2:12:16.040]  to care about the specific numbers
[2:12:16.040 --> 2:12:19.040]  but as a user, all it meant was when you used an iPhone
[2:12:19.040 --> 2:12:21.040]  the thing you thought you were tapping
[2:12:21.040 --> 2:12:23.040]  was the thing you were tapping almost every time.
[2:12:23.040 --> 2:12:24.040]  Whereas on that.
[2:12:24.040 --> 2:12:25.040]  Yeah, and I thought, you know,
[2:12:25.040 --> 2:12:28.040]  I thought this might be a reason to get the bigger screen
[2:12:28.040 --> 2:12:31.040]  but it sounds like, I mean, it also assumes
[2:12:31.040 --> 2:12:34.040]  that if you have a bigger screen, you've got bigger fingers
[2:12:34.040 --> 2:12:39.040]  but those touch targets aren't even any better on the bigger screen.
[2:12:39.040 --> 2:12:41.040]  Yeah, I don't think so.
[2:12:41.040 --> 2:12:43.040]  Now, that doesn't mean that there isn't
[2:12:43.040 --> 2:12:45.040]  an easy way to launch some of these apps
[2:12:45.040 --> 2:12:47.040]  because one of the things that I don't think Apple
[2:12:47.040 --> 2:12:50.040]  has emphasized enough is that from the regular watch face,
[2:12:50.040 --> 2:12:52.040]  if you have a complication up, you can just tap it
[2:12:52.040 --> 2:12:53.040]  to go to that app.
[2:12:53.040 --> 2:12:56.040]  So I always have the temperature up on all of the watch faces
[2:12:56.040 --> 2:12:59.040]  that I use and if I tap the temperature from my watch face,
[2:12:59.040 --> 2:13:02.040]  it jumps me to the weather app.
[2:13:02.040 --> 2:13:05.040]  It seems as though the touch target for that is,
[2:13:05.040 --> 2:13:06.040]  it's like the whole corner.
[2:13:06.040 --> 2:13:08.040]  It's the whole corner of the display
[2:13:08.040 --> 2:13:09.040]  and it always works.
[2:13:09.040 --> 2:13:12.040]  I don't miss it and I never tap the wrong thing
[2:13:12.040 --> 2:13:13.040]  and get something else.
[2:13:13.040 --> 2:13:14.040]  Whereas from that.
[2:13:14.040 --> 2:13:16.040]  Well, that's how I get to my activity app.
[2:13:16.040 --> 2:13:17.040]  I don't even know.
[2:13:17.040 --> 2:13:19.040]  I don't even know if they're calling at the home screen.
[2:13:19.040 --> 2:13:22.040]  I maybe they are,
[2:13:22.040 --> 2:13:24.040]  but I don't even think of it as the home screen
[2:13:24.040 --> 2:13:27.040]  and it's like one of the things you have to get used to
[2:13:27.040 --> 2:13:30.040]  as an iPhone or iPad user is you think of the home screen
[2:13:30.040 --> 2:13:32.040]  as the thing where you've hit a button
[2:13:32.040 --> 2:13:35.040]  and you see all your apps and then that's your home screen.
[2:13:35.040 --> 2:13:38.040]  To me, the home screen on the watch is the watch face
[2:13:38.040 --> 2:13:40.040]  and you can figure that the way you want it
[2:13:40.040 --> 2:13:43.040]  with your most used things and you launch things there
[2:13:43.040 --> 2:13:46.040]  and the home screen on the watch,
[2:13:46.040 --> 2:13:47.040]  the one you launched the apps from.
[2:13:47.040 --> 2:13:50.040]  I hate to say it because I think it's, you know,
[2:13:50.040 --> 2:13:55.040]  to me it's like the Android All Apps screen.
[2:13:55.040 --> 2:13:57.040]  I was just thinking the same thing.
[2:13:57.040 --> 2:13:58.040]  It really is.
[2:13:58.040 --> 2:14:01.040]  But yeah, it's like a tap away.
[2:14:01.040 --> 2:14:04.040]  That's what I don't, like the digital crown,
[2:14:04.040 --> 2:14:07.040]  I just feel like I wish I could map that button
[2:14:07.040 --> 2:14:09.040]  to be something else.
[2:14:09.040 --> 2:14:11.040]  Instead of going to all your apps?
[2:14:11.040 --> 2:14:13.040]  Yes.
[2:14:13.040 --> 2:14:14.040]  Yeah, I don't know.
[2:14:14.040 --> 2:14:16.040]  It's like I see why it's there
[2:14:16.040 --> 2:14:18.040]  and I just wish I could make them bigger
[2:14:18.040 --> 2:14:22.040]  and it is an interesting way to just say,
[2:14:22.040 --> 2:14:24.040]  okay, here's everything else.
[2:14:24.040 --> 2:14:26.040]  I mean, and that's the design of it.
[2:14:26.040 --> 2:14:27.040]  The way that you don't even organize them into pages,
[2:14:27.040 --> 2:14:29.040]  I kind of like that.
[2:14:29.040 --> 2:14:32.040]  I kind of like that you don't have to organize it.
[2:14:32.040 --> 2:14:35.040]  I feel like fiddling with the exact placement
[2:14:35.040 --> 2:14:37.040]  of which apps are on which screen on your iPhone
[2:14:37.040 --> 2:14:38.040]  can get old after a time.
[2:14:38.040 --> 2:14:41.040]  I kind of like that it's just this big globby thing
[2:14:41.040 --> 2:14:42.040]  that you can go out around.
[2:14:42.040 --> 2:14:44.040]  I could actually see that even working on the iPhone.
[2:14:44.040 --> 2:14:45.040]  At least as an option.
[2:14:45.040 --> 2:14:47.040]  It might be that everybody's muscle memory
[2:14:47.040 --> 2:14:49.040]  is so much that they can't just change it
[2:14:49.040 --> 2:14:50.040]  to be like that for everybody.
[2:14:50.040 --> 2:14:53.040]  But as an option, that might be an interesting way
[2:14:53.040 --> 2:14:55.040]  to get your apps on an iPhone.
[2:14:55.040 --> 2:15:00.040]  My favorite thing is like I just, it makes me wonder
[2:15:01.040 --> 2:15:03.040]  like who did they think could,
[2:15:03.040 --> 2:15:06.040]  when you hold down to delete an app,
[2:15:06.040 --> 2:15:08.040]  you get the tiny little apps.
[2:15:08.040 --> 2:15:12.040]  I mean, like I said in my, like the video,
[2:15:12.040 --> 2:15:16.040]  like is this for people with really small doll fingers?
[2:15:16.040 --> 2:15:19.040]  Like how are you supposed to delete this?
[2:15:19.040 --> 2:15:21.040]  Like you can hit it, but like it's,
[2:15:21.040 --> 2:15:24.040]  you're really holding your watch up close to your face
[2:15:24.040 --> 2:15:25.040]  to delete this.
[2:15:25.040 --> 2:15:27.040]  That's one of the features where you can do it both
[2:15:27.040 --> 2:15:31.040]  from the watch and from the app on the phone.
[2:15:31.040 --> 2:15:33.040]  And I kind of feel like maybe they should have made
[2:15:33.040 --> 2:15:38.040]  that just a, just a phone only thing.
[2:15:38.040 --> 2:15:40.040]  And there's other things where the tap targets
[2:15:40.040 --> 2:15:42.040]  to me are pretty good.
[2:15:42.040 --> 2:15:44.040]  So like when you're picking a button,
[2:15:44.040 --> 2:15:47.040]  like you're texting with somebody and you're like reply
[2:15:47.040 --> 2:15:49.040]  and then it gives you a bunch of options
[2:15:49.040 --> 2:15:53.040]  to choose from like yes, no, okay, absolutely.
[2:15:53.040 --> 2:15:56.040]  Those are generously sized.
[2:15:56.040 --> 2:15:58.040]  And I, you know, I don't find myself
[2:15:58.040 --> 2:15:59.040]  mis-tapping on them.
[2:15:59.040 --> 2:16:00.040]  I feel like they're big enough,
[2:16:00.040 --> 2:16:03.040]  but these little app icons on the app launching screen
[2:16:03.040 --> 2:16:05.040]  are too small.
[2:16:05.040 --> 2:16:06.040]  Yeah.
[2:16:06.040 --> 2:16:08.040]  Aesthetically I see why they did it,
[2:16:08.040 --> 2:16:10.040]  but it's, I really can't believe that it passed
[2:16:10.040 --> 2:16:12.040]  their own internal use.
[2:16:12.040 --> 2:16:15.040]  And the thing with the third party apps is this,
[2:16:15.040 --> 2:16:16.040]  the way that they work.
[2:16:16.040 --> 2:16:18.040]  I don't want to go into technical details of it,
[2:16:18.040 --> 2:16:20.040]  but they're not really apps.
[2:16:20.040 --> 2:16:22.040]  They're called watch kit extensions.
[2:16:22.040 --> 2:16:24.040]  Not to have the app on your phone.
[2:16:24.040 --> 2:16:27.040]  There's a real app on your phone for every one of them.
[2:16:27.040 --> 2:16:30.040]  There's no such thing yet as a watch only app.
[2:16:30.040 --> 2:16:32.040]  Third, third party.
[2:16:32.040 --> 2:16:34.040]  So it's running on your phone.
[2:16:34.040 --> 2:16:36.040]  You can optionally for any app on your phone
[2:16:36.040 --> 2:16:38.040]  that has a watch kit extension.
[2:16:38.040 --> 2:16:42.040]  You can choose whether it is there or not on your watch
[2:16:42.040 --> 2:16:45.040]  using the Apple watch app on your phone.
[2:16:45.040 --> 2:16:46.040]  And if it's there, it's there.
[2:16:46.040 --> 2:16:49.040]  But then when you run it, it doesn't really run on your phone.
[2:16:49.040 --> 2:16:52.040]  It's not executing code on the CPU on the watch.
[2:16:52.040 --> 2:16:53.040]  I mean, it doesn't really run on the watch.
[2:16:53.040 --> 2:16:55.040]  It doesn't execute code on the watch.
[2:16:55.040 --> 2:16:58.040]  It transmits over Bluetooth to your phone,
[2:16:58.040 --> 2:17:00.040]  and it executes on your phone,
[2:17:00.040 --> 2:17:03.040]  and then it projects these views onto your watch.
[2:17:03.040 --> 2:17:06.040]  Your watch, more or less, is sort of like a car play
[2:17:06.040 --> 2:17:09.040]  display, except it's only an inch big.
[2:17:09.040 --> 2:17:12.040]  And it means everything is a little laggy.
[2:17:12.040 --> 2:17:14.040]  It is super laggy to load.
[2:17:14.040 --> 2:17:17.040]  It's laggy to get data, and it's even like button pushes
[2:17:17.040 --> 2:17:19.040]  are laggy.
[2:17:19.040 --> 2:17:20.040]  Yeah.
[2:17:20.040 --> 2:17:22.040]  And I mean, even just to me,
[2:17:22.040 --> 2:17:25.040]  going through glances is laggy.
[2:17:25.040 --> 2:17:27.040]  Ooh, even the glances?
[2:17:27.040 --> 2:17:28.040]  Hmm.
[2:17:28.040 --> 2:17:30.040]  Like paging through the glances.
[2:17:30.040 --> 2:17:33.040]  Yeah, because sometimes they're not loaded yet.
[2:17:33.040 --> 2:17:35.040]  Right.
[2:17:35.040 --> 2:17:37.040]  But I do use the glances.
[2:17:37.040 --> 2:17:38.040]  I do use the glances.
[2:17:38.040 --> 2:17:40.040]  That's the other thing that I feel like keeps you
[2:17:40.040 --> 2:17:43.040]  from going to that app launching home screen
[2:17:43.040 --> 2:17:45.040]  is for the stuff that I do most frequently,
[2:17:45.040 --> 2:17:48.040]  I just go to the glance.
[2:17:48.040 --> 2:17:49.040]  Yeah.
[2:17:49.040 --> 2:17:53.040]  I don't use it all that much, the heart rate,
[2:17:53.040 --> 2:17:55.040]  and then the battery life I thought.
[2:17:55.040 --> 2:17:56.040]  Yeah, what about the now playing?
[2:17:56.040 --> 2:17:58.040]  Now playing is pretty cool.
[2:17:58.040 --> 2:17:59.040]  Yeah, that's cool.
[2:17:59.040 --> 2:18:00.040]  I don't use it.
[2:18:00.040 --> 2:18:01.040]  I mean, I guess when I'm running I have
[2:18:01.040 --> 2:18:03.040]  but I haven't really been using it too much.
[2:18:03.040 --> 2:18:05.040]  So the now playing glance, I think it's pretty cool.
[2:18:05.040 --> 2:18:06.040]  So whatever your iPhone is playing,
[2:18:06.040 --> 2:18:09.040]  whether it has a watch extension or not,
[2:18:09.040 --> 2:18:12.040]  if it's playing audio on your phone to your headphones,
[2:18:12.040 --> 2:18:16.040]  you can control play pause fast forward
[2:18:16.040 --> 2:18:20.040]  from the watch using the glance.
[2:18:20.040 --> 2:18:21.040]  Yeah.
[2:18:21.040 --> 2:18:22.040]  Sorry.
[2:18:22.040 --> 2:18:24.040]  This puppy's destroying me apart.
[2:18:24.040 --> 2:18:26.040]  If you need to go, just go.
[2:18:26.040 --> 2:18:27.040]  Just drop your mic.
[2:18:27.040 --> 2:18:29.040]  I'm just watching him.
[2:18:29.040 --> 2:18:32.040]  It's almost better because I can't communicate
[2:18:32.040 --> 2:18:33.040]  with this dog right now.
[2:18:33.040 --> 2:18:36.040]  So it's like I have like a little bit of a eye
[2:18:36.040 --> 2:18:38.040]  into his brain.
[2:18:38.040 --> 2:18:39.040]  You're like, OK.
[2:18:39.040 --> 2:18:40.040]  This is what you really want to do
[2:18:40.040 --> 2:18:42.040]  when you don't have my attention.
[2:18:42.040 --> 2:18:44.040]  Because I can't like respond back.
[2:18:44.040 --> 2:18:48.040]  The bottom line is it doesn't make me not like the watch,
[2:18:48.040 --> 2:18:51.040]  but it makes me question whether there should be third party apps
[2:18:51.040 --> 2:18:54.040]  for it at all yet.
[2:18:54.040 --> 2:18:55.040]  Yeah.
[2:18:55.040 --> 2:18:58.040]  I mean, to me like that was a thought I had early on
[2:18:58.040 --> 2:19:00.040]  when I got this thing was I just could not believe
[2:19:00.040 --> 2:19:02.040]  how much Apple was trying to do with it
[2:19:02.040 --> 2:19:06.040]  in a first generation product.
[2:19:06.040 --> 2:19:09.040]  Certainly ambitious, but it's just a lot.
[2:19:09.040 --> 2:19:11.040]  And it's very confusing.
[2:19:11.040 --> 2:19:14.040]  I mean, it takes a little bit of time
[2:19:14.040 --> 2:19:16.040]  a couple of days to figure out how to use this thing.
[2:19:16.040 --> 2:19:18.040]  See, I think confusing is slightly wrong
[2:19:18.040 --> 2:19:24.040]  because confusing, it to me it's disorienting at first.
[2:19:24.040 --> 2:19:26.040]  Whereas confusing to me implies
[2:19:26.040 --> 2:19:29.040]  that there's no logical layout to it.
[2:19:29.040 --> 2:19:32.040]  To me it's like you're in a well laid out building,
[2:19:32.040 --> 2:19:34.040]  but it's a big enough building
[2:19:34.040 --> 2:19:36.040]  that it's going to take you a couple of days
[2:19:36.040 --> 2:19:38.040]  to figure out your way around.
[2:19:38.040 --> 2:19:40.040]  Once you do, there's a sense to it.
[2:19:40.040 --> 2:19:44.040]  I do think it's very logically designed in a good way,
[2:19:44.040 --> 2:19:46.040]  but there's no question about it
[2:19:46.040 --> 2:19:48.040]  that when you first strap it on your wrist,
[2:19:48.040 --> 2:19:49.040]  it is disorienting.
[2:19:49.040 --> 2:19:52.040]  And you're like, well, how in the world do I turn this off?
[2:19:52.040 --> 2:19:55.040]  And it's, you know, you're spending half your time poking around
[2:19:55.040 --> 2:19:58.040]  your wrist and half your time poking around the watch on your phone
[2:19:58.040 --> 2:20:00.040]  and it's confusing.
[2:20:00.040 --> 2:20:02.040]  Well, I just said confusing.
[2:20:02.040 --> 2:20:04.040]  So maybe it is confusing.
[2:20:04.040 --> 2:20:05.040]  I think it's confusing.
[2:20:05.040 --> 2:20:09.040]  To me, the biggest source of confusion is the stuff that
[2:20:09.040 --> 2:20:12.040]  what's on the phone to control the watch
[2:20:12.040 --> 2:20:13.040]  and what's on the watch itself.
[2:20:13.040 --> 2:20:16.040]  That took me a long time and you kind of have to learn it
[2:20:16.040 --> 2:20:19.040]  on a case-by-case basis.
[2:20:19.040 --> 2:20:20.040]  Yeah.
[2:20:20.040 --> 2:20:23.040]  Yeah, no, I mean, it's funny.
[2:20:23.040 --> 2:20:25.040]  It's like the companion app,
[2:20:25.040 --> 2:20:28.040]  I did not talk enough about,
[2:20:28.040 --> 2:20:30.040]  but it really, that's what you've got to live in
[2:20:30.040 --> 2:20:32.040]  in the first couple of days when you're first setting this thing.
[2:20:32.040 --> 2:20:34.040]  Yes, absolutely.
[2:20:34.040 --> 2:20:36.040]  It's, you know, I think it's going to stay on your
[2:20:36.040 --> 2:20:37.040]  first iPhone home screen,
[2:20:37.040 --> 2:20:39.040]  but it's definitely to be on your first iPhone home screen
[2:20:39.040 --> 2:20:40.040]  when you're first setting it up.
[2:20:40.040 --> 2:20:41.040]  It's on mine.
[2:20:41.040 --> 2:20:43.040]  Yeah, it still is.
[2:20:43.040 --> 2:20:44.040]  Yeah.
[2:20:44.040 --> 2:20:45.040]  There's other cool stuff, though.
[2:20:45.040 --> 2:20:46.040]  The stuff.
[2:20:46.040 --> 2:20:49.040]  And again, I don't think notifications are a huge reason for it.
[2:20:49.040 --> 2:20:52.040]  I know, you know, everybody, I think,
[2:20:52.040 --> 2:20:53.040]  I think some people it's a big deal,
[2:20:53.040 --> 2:20:56.040]  but I think there's a reason why Apple isn't making that a flagship
[2:20:56.040 --> 2:20:58.040]  tent pole thing that they're not even talking about
[2:20:58.040 --> 2:20:59.040]  notifications.
[2:20:59.040 --> 2:21:02.040]  It's the, you know, using it as a watch,
[2:21:02.040 --> 2:21:05.040]  using it as a status indicator for things like the weather
[2:21:05.040 --> 2:21:09.040]  and your appointments and your fitness goals and stuff like that.
[2:21:09.040 --> 2:21:13.040]  And then to me, just the glances where you're not using apps,
[2:21:13.040 --> 2:21:16.040]  you're just quickly seeing something.
[2:21:16.040 --> 2:21:18.040]  Or the, to me, the primary points.
[2:21:18.040 --> 2:21:20.040]  And then this communication stuff.
[2:21:20.040 --> 2:21:21.040]  Who knows?
[2:21:21.040 --> 2:21:22.040]  We have to see how that goes.
[2:21:22.040 --> 2:21:23.040]  Right.
[2:21:23.040 --> 2:21:25.040]  And the fitness stuff for sure.
[2:21:25.040 --> 2:21:27.040]  And then the fitness stuff definitely,
[2:21:27.040 --> 2:21:31.040]  but it's, it's almost like a holy separate product category.
[2:21:31.040 --> 2:21:33.040]  Right.
[2:21:33.040 --> 2:21:34.040]  All right.
[2:21:34.040 --> 2:21:36.040]  Last but not least, the new MacBook.
[2:21:36.040 --> 2:21:37.040]  Yes.
[2:21:37.040 --> 2:21:40.040]  I've probably got like 10 minutes to live this guy.
[2:21:40.040 --> 2:21:42.040]  Absolutely perfectly.
[2:21:42.040 --> 2:21:47.040]  I think we can cover it quickly because it's.
[2:21:47.040 --> 2:21:52.040]  To me, I thought your review was a little harsh in a way
[2:21:52.040 --> 2:21:57.040]  that I feel like you, you, you were a little down on it overall.
[2:21:57.040 --> 2:21:59.040]  Because the battery life isn't as good
[2:21:59.040 --> 2:22:06.040]  and living with one port is, it's, it seems early.
[2:22:06.040 --> 2:22:08.040]  And your, your whole gimmick of it, the gimmick of your,
[2:22:08.040 --> 2:22:13.040]  the conceit of your video is that it's a, it's a laptop from the future.
[2:22:13.040 --> 2:22:14.040]  Right.
[2:22:14.040 --> 2:22:16.040]  Without the ecosystem to support it.
[2:22:16.040 --> 2:22:19.040]  I think it's, you know, I feel like what you underplayed is exactly
[2:22:19.040 --> 2:22:23.040]  how much it's the scenario is like the original MacBook Air,
[2:22:23.040 --> 2:22:26.040]  which to me, it's just, it's just a replay of that.
[2:22:26.040 --> 2:22:27.040]  Right.
[2:22:27.040 --> 2:22:28.040]  Right.
[2:22:28.040 --> 2:22:32.040]  Except that the original MacBook Air was even more outrageously priced.
[2:22:32.040 --> 2:22:37.040]  If, you know, it was like, it was like over $2,000.
[2:22:37.040 --> 2:22:38.040]  True.
[2:22:38.040 --> 2:22:39.040]  True.
[2:22:39.040 --> 2:22:42.040]  I, you know, I came at it looking at.
[2:22:42.040 --> 2:22:44.040]  There was two ways of looking at it, right?
[2:22:44.040 --> 2:22:47.040]  One was the price for what you get.
[2:22:47.040 --> 2:22:51.040]  And then there was, how much does this thing push the boundaries
[2:22:51.040 --> 2:22:54.040]  of what we have right now in our current laptops?
[2:22:54.040 --> 2:22:57.040]  So, you know, I was trying to look at it from both of those
[2:22:57.040 --> 2:22:59.040]  places.
[2:22:59.040 --> 2:23:00.040]  And you're right.
[2:23:00.040 --> 2:23:04.040]  And the end, like, I came at it a little bit harsh because I think for me,
[2:23:04.040 --> 2:23:07.040]  there was no way I was going to get this thing.
[2:23:07.040 --> 2:23:11.040]  And certainly there, there are definitely people I've heard from that said,
[2:23:11.040 --> 2:23:12.040]  okay, that's great.
[2:23:12.040 --> 2:23:14.040]  It's not for you, but I'm definitely getting one.
[2:23:14.040 --> 2:23:19.040]  And the main reasons that I wanted it were for the reasons that it pushed
[2:23:19.040 --> 2:23:20.040]  ahead laptops.
[2:23:20.040 --> 2:23:23.040]  Like, it's so incredibly beautiful this machine.
[2:23:23.040 --> 2:23:27.040]  It just, I mean, I love the trackpad.
[2:23:27.040 --> 2:23:28.040]  The keyboard is nice.
[2:23:28.040 --> 2:23:31.040]  But that's, you know, just between the trackpad and the screen,
[2:23:31.040 --> 2:23:33.040]  I really want this thing.
[2:23:33.040 --> 2:23:36.040]  And then there were all of these other things that when you looked at it
[2:23:36.040 --> 2:23:40.040]  in comparison to what you can get for the price for other laptops,
[2:23:40.040 --> 2:23:42.040]  it just didn't measure up.
[2:23:42.040 --> 2:23:45.040]  And it was this, obviously this push and pull of the compromise situation,
[2:23:45.040 --> 2:23:49.040]  which was the same with the original air.
[2:23:49.040 --> 2:23:54.040]  And, you know, both the performance in the battery life and that one port,
[2:23:54.040 --> 2:23:58.040]  I just felt like that is not pushing something ahead.
[2:23:58.040 --> 2:24:02.040]  And I liked what your comment was, you know, in terms of looking at it
[2:24:02.040 --> 2:24:04.040]  in terms of comparing to the iPad.
[2:24:04.040 --> 2:24:09.040]  But again, when you think about the iPad, you take a performance hit.
[2:24:09.040 --> 2:24:12.040]  It doesn't have, and it's not supposed to have the same performance as a laptop,
[2:24:12.040 --> 2:24:13.040]  as a computer, right?
[2:24:13.040 --> 2:24:17.040]  I mean, obviously those lines are blurring as we forge into this interesting
[2:24:17.040 --> 2:24:23.040]  area of these devices being both, but you take a big performance hit on this laptop.
[2:24:23.040 --> 2:24:25.040]  And it's, I felt it.
[2:24:25.040 --> 2:24:28.040]  It's a noticeable performance hit coming from the air.
[2:24:28.040 --> 2:24:30.040]  And it's a noticeable one in battery life.
[2:24:30.040 --> 2:24:32.040]  Now, of course the battery life has different things, right?
[2:24:32.040 --> 2:24:36.040]  If you compare it to the 11-inch air, it's getting more battery life, which is impressive.
[2:24:36.040 --> 2:24:41.040]  But most people coming from a 13-inch air, which is very portable for them,
[2:24:41.040 --> 2:24:44.040]  has the power they need, were used to all day battery life.
[2:24:44.040 --> 2:24:46.040]  And I just was not getting all day battery life from this thing.
[2:24:46.040 --> 2:24:49.040]  And I used to use, and I used an 11-inch air for years,
[2:24:49.040 --> 2:24:52.040]  and I, because I'm the sort, if I'm going to go in one direction,
[2:24:52.040 --> 2:24:54.040]  I like to go to the extreme.
[2:24:54.040 --> 2:24:58.040]  If I'm going to get the lightest, smallest laptop, I want the light, I want it even smaller.
[2:24:58.040 --> 2:25:00.040]  I want the 11, not the 13.
[2:25:00.040 --> 2:25:04.040]  But I think if you look at sales numbers, and if you just sort of eyeball coffee shops,
[2:25:04.040 --> 2:25:09.040]  the 13-inch is clearly the main apple.
[2:25:09.040 --> 2:25:14.040]  The 13-inch air is the flagship Apple laptop like,
[2:25:14.040 --> 2:25:18.040]  or maybe flagship's the wrong word, but it's certainly the most common one.
[2:25:18.040 --> 2:25:21.040]  And so therefore, it's the baseline to compare everything against.
[2:25:21.040 --> 2:25:26.040]  And I think it's fair to say, therefore, I think it's fair to say the new MacBook gets worse battery life,
[2:25:26.040 --> 2:25:34.040]  even if it's better than the 11, because I feel like it's eventually going to replace the 13 as we go on.
[2:25:34.040 --> 2:25:38.040]  I think the thing that most, a lot of people complaining about it,
[2:25:38.040 --> 2:25:45.040]  what they really wanted, I feel like, is an ice water in a health scenario.
[2:25:45.040 --> 2:25:48.040]  Just because you want it doesn't mean it's possible.
[2:25:48.040 --> 2:25:54.040]  I think what most people who are disappointed wanted was for Apple to just put retina screens in the MacBook Air.
[2:25:54.040 --> 2:25:56.040]  That I love everything else about my Air.
[2:25:56.040 --> 2:25:59.040]  All I want is a retina screen. Why couldn't you just give me that?
[2:25:59.040 --> 2:26:03.040]  Keep my USB ports. Keep my MagSafe charger.
[2:26:03.040 --> 2:26:08.040]  Let me have a Thunderbolt. Certainly, if you plug this thing into a Thunderbolt display,
[2:26:08.040 --> 2:26:13.040]  you're screwed because the $80 adapter doesn't even have Thunderbolt.
[2:26:13.040 --> 2:26:15.040]  And why couldn't you just give me that?
[2:26:15.040 --> 2:26:19.040]  And I think the reason you couldn't do that is that it clearly,
[2:26:19.040 --> 2:26:24.040]  these retina screens take up so much more battery power that the Air form factor wouldn't work.
[2:26:24.040 --> 2:26:26.040]  It had to be re-engineered.
[2:26:26.040 --> 2:26:31.040]  Right. And I would obviously love that product.
[2:26:31.040 --> 2:26:35.040]  And it's part of why I'm at this point considering getting a retina 13,
[2:26:35.040 --> 2:26:38.040]  because actually the battery life has gotten better on that 13.
[2:26:38.040 --> 2:26:40.040]  It has force touch. It has the retina screen.
[2:26:40.040 --> 2:26:46.040]  I actually think that laptop is a better buy at some point now than the 13-inch Air,
[2:26:46.040 --> 2:26:48.040]  especially if you're not on a strict budget.
[2:26:48.040 --> 2:26:49.040]  Yeah.
[2:26:49.040 --> 2:26:56.040]  But yeah, I mean, to me, it was hard to recommend to people,
[2:26:56.040 --> 2:26:59.040]  but it is an amazing feat of engineering.
[2:26:59.040 --> 2:27:05.040]  It is a beautiful laptop, and it's a pleasure to use when you are plugged into a wall
[2:27:05.040 --> 2:27:07.040]  and don't need anything else from it.
[2:27:07.040 --> 2:27:10.040]  And for the people who are out there, and I know that people like us,
[2:27:10.040 --> 2:27:12.040]  like people who really push the machines don't qualify for it,
[2:27:12.040 --> 2:27:14.040]  but I think out in the real world, there are a lot of people who are like,
[2:27:14.040 --> 2:27:17.040]  I've never plugged anything into my MacBook.
[2:27:17.040 --> 2:27:20.040]  And I've heard in people who say that they're, you know,
[2:27:20.040 --> 2:27:23.040]  yes, I redoing Fireball, but my husband or my wife,
[2:27:23.040 --> 2:27:27.040]  or whoever that they know their daughter, or whatever their son,
[2:27:27.040 --> 2:27:29.040]  never plugs anything into the MacBook.
[2:27:29.040 --> 2:27:32.040]  Well, then it might be a great machine, right?
[2:27:32.040 --> 2:27:35.040]  And that's where people are saying, well, I don't need that power.
[2:27:35.040 --> 2:27:36.040]  I don't need it.
[2:27:36.040 --> 2:27:37.040]  Well, then that's great.
[2:27:37.040 --> 2:27:40.040]  You're paying for this beautiful design and this beautiful screen,
[2:27:40.040 --> 2:27:43.040]  but you're compromising the power and the battery life.
[2:27:43.040 --> 2:27:44.040]  Yeah.
[2:27:44.040 --> 2:27:49.040]  And it's fine, but you're paying more money to get less, you know,
[2:27:49.040 --> 2:27:51.040]  I'll be less functionality.
[2:27:51.040 --> 2:27:55.040]  The other thing, last but not least, is that one USB-C port.
[2:27:55.040 --> 2:28:00.040]  And I know John Syracuse, as he seems to truly confounded by,
[2:28:00.040 --> 2:28:04.040]  I'm not quite caught up on the accidental tech podcast as we record this,
[2:28:04.040 --> 2:28:06.040]  but I know he's gone over and I'm like, why not too?
[2:28:06.040 --> 2:28:07.040]  Why only one?
[2:28:07.040 --> 2:28:08.040]  Why one?
[2:28:08.040 --> 2:28:09.040]  Right.
[2:28:09.040 --> 2:28:12.040]  And I don't, I cannot bring myself to believe that it's engineering.
[2:28:12.040 --> 2:28:16.040]  I cannot believe that they couldn't, that, that putting a second one in,
[2:28:16.040 --> 2:28:20.040]  would, you know, obviously it would take some space,
[2:28:20.040 --> 2:28:22.040]  and therefore it'd take a little bit of the battery space away.
[2:28:22.040 --> 2:28:24.040]  I just can't believe it would matter that much
[2:28:24.040 --> 2:28:26.040]  for something that clearly is a pretty small part.
[2:28:26.040 --> 2:28:33.040]  I think it's a philosophical thing where they philosophically wanted to make it like the iPad,
[2:28:33.040 --> 2:28:35.040]  where there's one port.
[2:28:35.040 --> 2:28:45.040]  And the downfall of that though is that nobody has ever grown the habit of charging devices from their iPad.
[2:28:45.040 --> 2:28:49.040]  And the iPad gets longer battery life too.
[2:28:49.040 --> 2:28:50.040]  Yeah.
[2:28:50.040 --> 2:28:54.040]  I mean, just, just by the nature that have we used it, right?
[2:28:54.040 --> 2:28:58.040]  Like, I don't charge my iPad every day because I don't live on it every day, right?
[2:28:58.040 --> 2:29:03.040]  I mean, I charge it every couple of days, but I might not stand just because I like to have more power,
[2:29:03.040 --> 2:29:04.040]  and I don't have to.
[2:29:04.040 --> 2:29:07.040]  Different people use USB ports for all sorts of different things.
[2:29:07.040 --> 2:29:10.040]  I know photographers, you know, plugging in cameras and they're, you know,
[2:29:10.040 --> 2:29:14.040]  and they're all sorts of other things, peripherals, external hard drives for some people.
[2:29:14.040 --> 2:29:22.040]  But the one to me, the Apple to me, maybe isn't a little bit of denial with on the one port on the MacBook,
[2:29:22.040 --> 2:29:28.040]  is, and you and I just talked about this half an hour ago, is the need to charge your iPhone during the day.
[2:29:28.040 --> 2:29:30.040]  And I know I've done it.
[2:29:30.040 --> 2:29:36.040]  I've done it one amount of the house and working remotely that I don't even plug, you know, like from the train,
[2:29:36.040 --> 2:29:45.040]  in an Amtrak, if I don't have a working AC adapter next to me, or if I don't have the window seat and I don't want to reach across a stranger to plug in.
[2:29:45.040 --> 2:29:51.040]  I'll just plug my phone, because I know that I'm going to get home from to Philly from New York with plenty of battery life on my MacBook Pro.
[2:29:51.040 --> 2:29:55.040]  I'll just borrow some of that and reduce my phone.
[2:29:55.040 --> 2:30:00.040]  And if you're also charging your MacBook, you can't do that now, right?
[2:30:00.040 --> 2:30:04.040]  And there are sometimes when your MacBooks already run down and you want to charge your phone,
[2:30:04.040 --> 2:30:07.040]  and you need that second port just as a charger.
[2:30:07.040 --> 2:30:13.040]  Right, you need this dongle. Basically, you need this dongle to get by with using this laptop in my opinion.
[2:30:13.040 --> 2:30:19.040]  And again, it's like they should just bundle the dongle, which they're definitely not going to ever do, and they charge you the dollar.
[2:30:19.040 --> 2:30:29.040]  And the $80 price on that really plays into the worst of perceiving Apple, because to me, it's actually accurate.
[2:30:29.040 --> 2:30:33.040]  It is. They're the richest company in the world, and they're charging.
[2:30:33.040 --> 2:30:35.040]  And they're charging for plastic.
[2:30:35.040 --> 2:30:41.040]  For an $80 thing that is quite frankly ugly by necessity, right?
[2:30:41.040 --> 2:30:57.040]  You've taken this graceful little tiny elegant USB-C port and turned it into this big white thing that looks like it's something they would hook up to you in a hospital with three ugly ports on it.
[2:30:57.040 --> 2:31:01.040]  Or two ugly ports in one more USB-C port.
[2:31:01.040 --> 2:31:08.040]  Right, I mean, yeah, I guess I should have looked at it a little bit closer to the iPad and that use case.
[2:31:08.040 --> 2:31:11.040]  And I certainly think that is the way we are going.
[2:31:11.040 --> 2:31:17.040]  And that's where I think as this future evolves, that is what our computers look like.
[2:31:17.040 --> 2:31:22.040]  It's like all we need is a screen with a flat piece of keyboard.
[2:31:22.040 --> 2:31:28.040]  And actually, it's very close to what Microsoft's been trying to do with the surface for a long time now.
[2:31:28.040 --> 2:31:33.040]  But more and more, when I review that surface or use that surface, I just wish it was a laptop.
[2:31:33.040 --> 2:31:38.040]  So I really like the way they've gone with this.
[2:31:38.040 --> 2:31:44.040]  What remains interesting to me, or we don't know yet, is what that iPad Pro might look like.
[2:31:44.040 --> 2:31:45.040]  Right.
[2:31:45.040 --> 2:31:49.040]  And how are those any different than what we've seen with the MacBook.
[2:31:49.040 --> 2:31:57.040]  But I think it's pretty clear, like where when something starts as a laptop and has some of that tablet functionality,
[2:31:57.040 --> 2:32:02.040]  or we have that tablet that becomes that laptop where the sacrifices are.
[2:32:02.040 --> 2:32:07.040]  In this case, it just seems like we are making too many sacrifices to move in that direction.
[2:32:07.040 --> 2:32:11.040]  Yeah, and I think for everybody like us and the people who probably listened to this show, it is.
[2:32:11.040 --> 2:32:12.040]  It's a device from the future.
[2:32:12.040 --> 2:32:17.040]  It's a prototype from the future that's not ready for our day-to-day use.
[2:32:17.040 --> 2:32:18.040]  But it will be.
[2:32:18.040 --> 2:32:26.040]  And I think it's a clear bet from Apple that two or three years from now, we are going to be using a laptop that really is just as much a little peripheral.
[2:32:26.040 --> 2:32:28.040]  As the iPad is.
[2:32:28.040 --> 2:32:29.040]  Right.
[2:32:29.040 --> 2:32:44.040]  And what I love about it is it means there is this huge bright future for laptops, or just devices that we can be highly productive on that don't look like this traditional computer or laptop we've known.
[2:32:44.040 --> 2:32:46.040]  And that's what the air was.
[2:32:46.040 --> 2:32:47.040]  Right.
[2:32:47.040 --> 2:32:49.040]  And that was such a huge step in the industry.
[2:32:49.040 --> 2:32:51.040]  And this is also going to be a huge step in the industry.
[2:32:51.040 --> 2:33:02.040]  There's no way we're not going to see ASUS or Microsoft or some other PC manufacturer taking notes from this and trying to do something very similar very soon.
[2:33:02.040 --> 2:33:05.040]  Great points.
[2:33:05.040 --> 2:33:07.040]  Thank you so much for your time.
[2:33:07.040 --> 2:33:08.040]  Amazing.
[2:33:08.040 --> 2:33:12.040]  Thank you so much for reviewing so many products in one week.
[2:33:12.040 --> 2:33:14.040]  Yeah, never again.
[2:33:14.040 --> 2:33:16.040]  I say never again, but of course.
[2:33:16.040 --> 2:33:21.040]  And getting a puppy in there.
[2:33:21.040 --> 2:33:22.040]  Probably the worst mistake of it.
[2:33:22.040 --> 2:33:23.040]  The homepage.
[2:33:23.040 --> 2:33:28.040]  Best place to read is w s j d dot com.
[2:33:28.040 --> 2:33:29.040]  Is that.
[2:33:29.040 --> 2:33:30.040]  Yeah.
[2:33:30.040 --> 2:33:35.040]  Is that's the homepage for the Wall Street Journal digital team.
[2:33:35.040 --> 2:33:41.040]  Joanna Stern some of the I unbelievable timing because I would have wanted to have you on to talk about the MacBook.
[2:33:41.040 --> 2:33:46.040]  I would have wanted you to have you on to talk about the Apple Watch and I got to have you on to talk about both.
[2:33:46.040 --> 2:33:49.040]  So I cannot thank you enough for your time.
[2:33:49.040 --> 2:33:50.040]  Yeah.
[2:33:50.040 --> 2:33:51.040]  I know I love doing it.
[2:33:51.040 --> 2:33:52.040]  All right.
[2:33:52.040 --> 2:33:53.040]  Good luck with.
[2:33:53.040 --> 2:33:54.040]  I got to find my own positive podcast or something.
[2:33:54.040 --> 2:33:55.040]  I don't know.
[2:33:55.040 --> 2:33:56.040]  I just can't find the time.
[2:33:56.040 --> 2:33:58.040]  It's surprising how hard it can be.
[2:33:58.040 --> 2:33:59.040]  Yeah.
[2:33:59.040 --> 2:34:15.040]  Good luck with the dog poop.
