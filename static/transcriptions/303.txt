[00:00.000 --> 00:02.820]  Are you tired of looking at new Apple products?
[00:02.820 --> 00:04.640]  I mean, I hesitate to say that.
[00:04.640 --> 00:06.000]  It sounds uncharitable.
[00:06.000 --> 00:08.560]  It has been quite an intense schedule.
[00:08.560 --> 00:10.760]  I think it's obviously partially because they
[00:10.760 --> 00:12.680]  try to dump everything at once normally,
[00:12.680 --> 00:14.880]  and now it's strung out over weeks.
[00:14.880 --> 00:16.040]  But yeah, it's a lot.
[00:16.040 --> 00:17.560]  It's been a lot.
[00:17.560 --> 00:18.720]  I can't phone any of it in.
[00:18.720 --> 00:20.640]  I'm physically impossible at phoning stuff in.
[00:20.640 --> 00:24.280]  So it's just exhausting, that's all.
[00:24.280 --> 00:26.200]  I have the same thought, and there's
[00:26.200 --> 00:29.240]  a part of me that gets a little petulant.
[00:29.240 --> 00:35.640]  So I was very excited to get the AirPods Max,
[00:35.640 --> 00:38.880]  because they look really neat, and they're very expensive.
[00:38.880 --> 00:41.080]  And it sure is fun to be able to try them
[00:41.080 --> 00:42.840]  without ordering a pair.
[00:42.840 --> 00:45.560]  And now at this point, in addition to spending $550,
[00:45.560 --> 00:49.280]  you have to wait weeks and weeks to get them.
[00:49.280 --> 00:51.920]  But then when they're like the end review
[00:51.920 --> 00:53.960]  embargoes drop Thursday morning.
[00:53.960 --> 00:56.160]  And it's like, 24 hours, F you.
[00:56.160 --> 00:58.640]  I'm just going to phone this in and write three sentences.
[00:58.640 --> 01:02.880]  Sound good, too heavy, there, done, publish.
[01:02.880 --> 01:03.640]  But I can't.
[01:03.640 --> 01:05.600]  I have to start.
[01:05.600 --> 01:06.680]  Yeah, of course.
[01:06.680 --> 01:08.600]  And it wasn't even the review embargo, right?
[01:08.600 --> 01:14.440]  It's just like, hey, this is the next morning first look stuff.
[01:14.440 --> 01:19.400]  So I refused personally to review them officially,
[01:19.400 --> 01:20.880]  because I'm like, there's no way.
[01:20.880 --> 01:23.040]  And I felt it wouldn't do anybody a service
[01:23.040 --> 01:26.480]  to pretend that I had some sort of fully formed
[01:26.480 --> 01:28.040]  opinion on these things.
[01:28.040 --> 01:32.080]  But at the same time, I can't just go like, oh, hey, look,
[01:32.080 --> 01:32.880]  here's the pictures.
[01:32.880 --> 01:33.560]  I don't know.
[01:33.560 --> 01:36.120]  I'm just incapable of it.
[01:36.120 --> 01:40.360]  Well, and I also feel like, and I get it, in some sense,
[01:40.360 --> 01:43.080]  I feel a little less pressure, because it
[01:43.080 --> 01:45.320]  looks like at this point nobody's
[01:45.320 --> 01:49.640]  getting them for Christmas, if you haven't already ordered.
[01:49.640 --> 01:50.160]  Right.
[01:50.160 --> 01:52.560]  Although maybe if you're not an early adopter who's
[01:52.560 --> 01:55.200]  going to order them anyway, you're not going to get them
[01:55.200 --> 01:55.560]  yet.
[01:55.560 --> 01:57.360]  Maybe you could still get the silver ones.
[01:57.360 --> 01:58.720]  I don't know.
[01:58.720 --> 02:00.120]  I don't know.
[02:00.120 --> 02:02.320]  There was that fun thing that you pointed out
[02:02.320 --> 02:06.320]  that you could get engraved ones in December,
[02:06.320 --> 02:08.720]  but you couldn't get non-engraved ones
[02:08.720 --> 02:10.040]  until January.
[02:10.040 --> 02:11.200]  Right.
[02:11.200 --> 02:15.520]  And it didn't last long, but it lasted about an hour.
[02:15.520 --> 02:17.600]  And it's like, what if you really want
[02:17.600 --> 02:19.640]  a pair that's not engraved?
[02:19.640 --> 02:21.520]  You don't want any marks on them at all,
[02:21.520 --> 02:23.320]  but you really want them by Christmas.
[02:23.320 --> 02:26.600]  What is the least intrusive engraving
[02:26.600 --> 02:29.360]  that they would let you put?
[02:29.360 --> 02:34.160]  So they won't let you just put a space.
[02:34.160 --> 02:38.800]  Their little engraving dingus interprets
[02:38.800 --> 02:41.360]  that as no engraving at all.
[02:41.360 --> 02:43.880]  So if you go to say, I would like to get my AirPods
[02:43.880 --> 02:47.160]  engraved, and this entire string you enter
[02:47.160 --> 02:52.800]  is just a space or a series of spaces, and then you hit OK,
[02:52.800 --> 02:54.880]  it goes back to the next screen, and it
[02:54.880 --> 02:58.200]  has no engraving selected, which makes sense.
[02:58.200 --> 03:00.760]  Oh, uh-huh, yeah.
[03:00.760 --> 03:03.560]  Did you try, this is random, but did you
[03:03.560 --> 03:05.720]  try using a zero-width space?
[03:05.720 --> 03:08.600]  No, I didn't try any fancy Unicode.
[03:08.600 --> 03:09.280]  OK.
[03:09.280 --> 03:10.280]  That would be clever.
[03:10.280 --> 03:13.040]  I did try a dash, which would just look like a little,
[03:13.040 --> 03:15.800]  you know.
[03:15.800 --> 03:18.880]  I also thought, I forget, I think
[03:18.880 --> 03:22.000]  that the engraving goes on the left cup
[03:22.000 --> 03:25.080]  because the right cup is the one with the controls.
[03:25.080 --> 03:28.880]  So I thought, what if you just put an L, right?
[03:33.880 --> 03:35.800]  Even if you don't want them engraved,
[03:35.800 --> 03:37.440]  you don't want to put your name on them,
[03:37.440 --> 03:39.080]  you don't want to put something clever on them,
[03:39.080 --> 03:42.320]  you don't want an emoji, just put an L.
[03:42.320 --> 03:46.000]  I like that it's minimal because it's very Appleistic.
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.840]  It's like, hey, we only need one because obviously
[03:48.840 --> 03:50.640]  the other one is R.
[03:50.640 --> 03:54.240]  Right, but how bizarre is it that for a while at least
[03:54.240 --> 03:56.360]  you were able to, and it's just, I'm
[03:56.360 --> 03:58.160]  sure it would actually be fascinating
[03:58.160 --> 03:59.800]  and it's the sort of thing they're never
[03:59.800 --> 04:01.320]  going to talk about, but it would
[04:01.320 --> 04:04.960]  be fascinating to get Jeff Williams to explain it.
[04:04.960 --> 04:07.560]  And I'm sure that it's a fascinating explanation
[04:07.560 --> 04:09.760]  of the different supply chain paths
[04:09.760 --> 04:14.760]  that engraved versus non-engraved ones take.
[04:14.760 --> 04:19.080]  In theory, engraving should take longer, but you know.
[04:19.080 --> 04:24.760]  Well, in my mind, if you just go the dummy route on the supply
[04:24.760 --> 04:27.760]  chain analysis here, it would probably
[04:27.760 --> 04:30.280]  be that there's a certain amount set aside for engraving
[04:30.280 --> 04:32.520]  because they go to a facility for engraving.
[04:32.520 --> 04:34.720]  And it's like if you're going to get them engraved,
[04:34.720 --> 04:38.080]  they come from this pool, which is usually less purchased.
[04:38.080 --> 04:41.440]  People probably buy far more without engraving.
[04:41.440 --> 04:43.760]  And then those are still in stock.
[04:43.760 --> 04:46.640]  So that's probably, just the simplistic way
[04:46.640 --> 04:47.600]  of looking at it.
[04:47.600 --> 04:50.080]  By the way, I just tried to zero with space.
[04:50.080 --> 04:53.520]  It does not work, so sorry for anybody looking to do that.
[04:53.520 --> 04:57.960]  Do you get your stuff engraved when it's offered?
[04:57.960 --> 05:00.000]  Very, very rarely.
[05:00.000 --> 05:02.720]  Literally, the only thing I currently own,
[05:02.720 --> 05:05.440]  I have in the past, and like for my wife
[05:05.440 --> 05:08.240]  maybe gotten her a phone engraved, you know.
[05:08.240 --> 05:09.920]  I think maybe even her current phone is.
[05:09.920 --> 05:11.720]  But the only thing I currently own
[05:11.720 --> 05:15.520]  is an AirPods Pro case with an emoji on it.
[05:15.520 --> 05:16.880]  And the only reason I did that is
[05:16.880 --> 05:18.760]  because I know which one is my current one
[05:18.760 --> 05:21.400]  and which one is mine and not an Apple review unit
[05:21.400 --> 05:22.880]  as they come and go.
[05:22.880 --> 05:25.480]  And that way I know that one's mine
[05:25.480 --> 05:27.320]  because I have a lot of AirPods around here
[05:27.320 --> 05:30.760]  either that I've purchased or when Apple drops new ones
[05:30.760 --> 05:33.360]  and I review a unit, it's sitting here.
[05:33.360 --> 05:35.080]  And then I don't know which one's which.
[05:35.080 --> 05:36.800]  All right.
[05:36.800 --> 05:39.320]  I would like to get my stuff engraved,
[05:39.320 --> 05:43.080]  but I can never decide what to get engraved on it.
[05:43.080 --> 05:46.480]  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[05:46.480 --> 05:47.400]  And then I realized.
[05:47.400 --> 05:48.600]  A paralysis of choice.
[05:48.600 --> 05:53.240]  Yeah, I mean, it really, I will sit there
[05:53.240 --> 05:57.600]  in front of the engraving form for a very long period of time.
[05:57.600 --> 05:59.920]  And then I'll think, well, this isn't getting me anywhere.
[05:59.920 --> 06:02.160]  And then a sensible person would think,
[06:02.160 --> 06:04.000]  this isn't getting me anywhere.
[06:04.000 --> 06:06.680]  I'll just order no engraved and be done with it.
[06:06.680 --> 06:09.280]  But what I'll do is I'll say, I'll think to myself,
[06:09.280 --> 06:10.920]  I need to get up and walk around.
[06:10.920 --> 06:12.960]  Maybe I'll take a walk.
[06:12.960 --> 06:13.920]  I'll put my coat on.
[06:13.920 --> 06:18.360]  I'm going to go pick up some bread or something like that
[06:18.360 --> 06:21.480]  just to clear my head so I can think about this.
[06:21.480 --> 06:24.160]  And then I realize, it's like I'm doing all this.
[06:24.160 --> 06:28.000]  And I'm taking a walk to clear your head, get some ideas.
[06:28.000 --> 06:29.800]  That's all well and good, and it works.
[06:29.800 --> 06:33.120]  But it's like I'm not doing it for something clever
[06:33.120 --> 06:34.000]  to write about.
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.400]  I'm doing it to figure out what should I get engraved.
[06:38.400 --> 06:41.160]  No, try to slice an editorial Gordian knot.
[06:41.160 --> 06:44.760]  You're trying to figure out whether to do the rock emoji
[06:44.760 --> 06:46.280]  or the OK emoji.
[06:46.280 --> 06:48.680]  Well, for me, it'd be so super boring.
[06:48.680 --> 06:53.080]  Should I just get like JG, or should I just get Gruber?
[06:53.080 --> 06:54.600]  Or should I go with that?
[06:54.600 --> 06:57.920]  They do give you a star emoji.
[06:57.920 --> 07:01.480]  Right, right.
[07:01.480 --> 07:02.760]  Maybe just Gruber, just Gruber.
[07:02.760 --> 07:04.120]  Why are we the way that we are?
[07:04.120 --> 07:05.320]  I don't understand this.
[07:05.320 --> 07:06.800]  Right, and then I would just wish.
[07:06.800 --> 07:07.800]  It makes me wish.
[07:07.800 --> 07:10.840]  I was like, oh, god, I wish they would just charge $25
[07:10.840 --> 07:13.760]  to engrave it, because then I would say, ah, forget it.
[07:13.760 --> 07:15.280]  Exactly, exactly.
[07:15.280 --> 07:17.720]  Free is the worst.
[07:17.720 --> 07:20.320]  Charge me $1, because then I have an excuse to be like, ah,
[07:20.320 --> 07:21.640]  I'll just get the $1.
[07:21.640 --> 07:24.200]  I'm not for like AirPods Pro, right?
[07:24.200 --> 07:28.080]  I ordered AirPods Pro last year, and I got them.
[07:28.080 --> 07:31.560]  And it's like I'm not worried about like,
[07:31.560 --> 07:33.720]  oh, if I get my name engraved on the case,
[07:33.720 --> 07:35.440]  then the resale value is no go.
[07:35.440 --> 07:37.920]  I'm not going to see who's going to buy a used pair of AirPods
[07:37.920 --> 07:38.420]  Pro.
[07:38.420 --> 07:39.120]  Well, people do.
[07:39.120 --> 07:40.960]  But yeah, I would never sell them personally.
[07:40.960 --> 07:42.560]  I'm not.
[07:42.560 --> 07:43.960]  So it has nothing to do with that.
[07:43.960 --> 07:47.960]  It's just pure indecision.
[07:47.960 --> 07:48.440]  Terrible.
[07:48.440 --> 07:51.240]  Yeah.
[07:51.240 --> 07:52.820]  And again, and then there's something
[07:52.820 --> 07:55.080]  to me with the AirPods Max, where
[07:55.080 --> 07:57.400]  it's like there's a little bit of an asymmetry there.
[07:57.400 --> 07:59.240]  Now, they're permanently asymmetrical,
[07:59.240 --> 08:01.760]  because the controls are only on the right,
[08:01.760 --> 08:03.000]  and the engravings on the left.
[08:03.000 --> 08:06.000]  Anyway, paralysis, I don't know.
[08:06.000 --> 08:07.200]  I don't know what I would do.
[08:07.200 --> 08:08.560]  But anyway, you can't get them by Christmas,
[08:08.560 --> 08:11.960]  so it's no worries.
[08:11.960 --> 08:15.120]  You and I had very similar thoughts.
[08:15.120 --> 08:17.680]  I say this all the time.
[08:17.680 --> 08:18.800]  It's always a relief.
[08:18.800 --> 08:21.280]  It's like I don't want to go on and on about how heavy
[08:21.280 --> 08:21.980]  these things are.
[08:21.980 --> 08:23.560]  And then I read all the other reviews,
[08:23.560 --> 08:24.640]  and nobody says anything.
[08:24.640 --> 08:27.200]  And it's like maybe this is completely normal.
[08:27.200 --> 08:29.160]  Or maybe, yeah, exactly.
[08:29.160 --> 08:30.640]  Maybe I used to have a weak neck.
[08:30.640 --> 08:31.140]  Yeah.
[08:34.340 --> 08:36.380]  I think President Trump has actually
[08:36.380 --> 08:37.600]  called people pencil necks.
[08:37.600 --> 08:40.400]  Remember?
[08:40.400 --> 08:44.440]  That was big in the 80s to call somebody a pencil neck geek.
[08:44.440 --> 08:46.280]  Yeah, is there something wrong with my neck?
[08:46.280 --> 08:47.520]  Yeah, I'm on the frat crowd.
[08:47.520 --> 08:49.400]  I don't know.
[08:49.400 --> 08:54.160]  But these are heavy headphones, in my opinion.
[08:54.160 --> 08:55.320]  They're about 100 grams.
[08:55.320 --> 08:58.400]  I put them on my kitchen scale.
[08:58.400 --> 09:00.760]  I have a fairly accurate one I use for baking and whatnot.
[09:00.760 --> 09:02.960]  And I put them on there, and they're
[09:02.960 --> 09:06.440]  like 385 or 89 grams or something,
[09:06.440 --> 09:10.040]  which is about 100 grams heavier than a pair of Beats Studio,
[09:10.040 --> 09:12.400]  which obviously, sure, there are heavier headphones
[09:12.400 --> 09:13.720]  in between somewhere.
[09:13.720 --> 09:17.400]  But I do believe that's on the higher end of the scale.
[09:17.400 --> 09:22.760]  Yeah, and I have the Bose QuietComfort 35 IIs.
[09:22.760 --> 09:25.800]  And I guess Bose has another one, a 700s, which
[09:25.800 --> 09:27.040]  I haven't looked at recently.
[09:27.040 --> 09:31.960]  I mean, I'm not enough of a traveler and not enough of a,
[09:31.960 --> 09:35.640]  I'm not a Marco Arman who's going to collect headphones.
[09:35.640 --> 09:38.720]  But the Bose are 200 and some, so it's
[09:38.720 --> 09:40.200]  a little bit over 100 grams.
[09:40.200 --> 09:42.600]  And you feel it, right?
[09:42.600 --> 09:44.400]  It's not just 100 grams.
[09:44.400 --> 09:50.400]  It's the fact that it's 100 or 50 extra each on each ear cup.
[09:50.400 --> 09:53.960]  Because the weight is clearly all on the ear cups.
[09:57.720 --> 10:00.920]  But again, I'm not saying it's a problem.
[10:00.920 --> 10:03.160]  And I thought you put it pretty well.
[10:03.160 --> 10:05.440]  I thought your review where you were just like, look,
[10:05.440 --> 10:07.240]  if you don't like heavy headphones, don't buy these.
[10:07.240 --> 10:07.720]  That's it.
[10:07.720 --> 10:09.480]  But it's not like it's a problem.
[10:09.480 --> 10:12.680]  But I also think you nailed it where it's,
[10:12.680 --> 10:16.200]  and I think I sort of fall into that category as somebody who
[10:16.200 --> 10:19.400]  doesn't follow the headphone industry.
[10:19.400 --> 10:22.800]  I get a pair I like, and that's it.
[10:22.800 --> 10:25.240]  I was a little surprised at how heavy they were.
[10:25.240 --> 10:27.400]  And maybe I shouldn't have been based on the fact
[10:27.400 --> 10:29.400]  that they are really high end in terms
[10:29.400 --> 10:35.000]  of the drivers and the quality they're trying to produce.
[10:35.000 --> 10:41.520]  But I even put it in my headline because I wanted to be clever.
[10:41.520 --> 10:46.000]  But again, I'm not saying there's a reason not to buy it.
[10:46.000 --> 10:47.640]  I'm not saying it's a product failure.
[10:47.640 --> 10:50.960]  But this is something to think about.
[10:50.960 --> 10:54.520]  Yeah, I think it's sort of that same feeling
[10:54.520 --> 10:58.360]  that you get when you buy, I don't know,
[10:58.360 --> 11:00.760]  a really high quality pen, right?
[11:00.760 --> 11:02.720]  Like a really high quality pen.
[11:02.720 --> 11:04.080]  Very, very nice.
[11:04.080 --> 11:08.680]  We're talking almost decorative.
[11:08.680 --> 11:09.720]  It's usable.
[11:09.720 --> 11:11.920]  And in fact, maybe one of the best pens
[11:11.920 --> 11:15.240]  made for writing simply because they spent so much money making
[11:15.240 --> 11:17.960]  it, and the craftsmanship is high, and all of that stuff.
[11:17.960 --> 11:19.400]  But then you use it, and you're like,
[11:19.400 --> 11:21.320]  do I really want to scribble with this thing all day?
[11:21.320 --> 11:22.960]  Because it's pretty heavy, right?
[11:22.960 --> 11:24.680]  It's kind of like that, where you
[11:24.680 --> 11:29.280]  know that the heaviness is a sign of overall craftsmanship
[11:29.280 --> 11:32.760]  and quality, which heaviness sometimes is.
[11:32.760 --> 11:34.720]  Sometimes it's not, right?
[11:34.720 --> 11:36.800]  I remember this is a little tiny anecdote,
[11:36.800 --> 11:39.280]  but back when I used to sell cameras,
[11:39.280 --> 11:40.880]  one of the big things we'd do was
[11:40.880 --> 11:47.760]  people would come in with these sort of knockoffs of Canon SLRs
[11:47.760 --> 11:50.800]  that they would get sold by a mail order, usually.
[11:50.800 --> 11:52.800]  It would be like, hey, mail order this SLR, right?
[11:52.800 --> 11:54.120]  And they would get it.
[11:54.120 --> 11:57.600]  And it's a plastic body that has the shape of an SLR.
[11:57.600 --> 12:00.080]  But in fact, there's no real prism.
[12:00.080 --> 12:03.840]  It's just a viewfinder, rangefinder on top.
[12:03.840 --> 12:06.280]  And then it's a complete plastic body.
[12:06.280 --> 12:08.840]  It technically does work, but it's essentially
[12:08.840 --> 12:11.240]  a fixed lens pinhole camera, right?
[12:11.240 --> 12:12.800]  It technically does.
[12:12.800 --> 12:14.640]  You could put film in it in the whole bit,
[12:14.640 --> 12:17.240]  but they think they got something special for a deal.
[12:17.240 --> 12:19.160]  But then if you crack those things open,
[12:19.160 --> 12:21.600]  what it is is it's an empty plastic shell that's
[12:21.600 --> 12:23.960]  one step above a disposable camera,
[12:23.960 --> 12:26.240]  only because it can be reused, right?
[12:26.240 --> 12:30.120]  And then in the bottom, they put a slab of lead
[12:30.120 --> 12:33.280]  to make it feel like pig metal or whatever.
[12:33.280 --> 12:38.160]  They put a slab in the bottom of it to make it feel hefty.
[12:38.160 --> 12:40.360]  So when they pick it up, they're like, oh, this is great.
[12:40.360 --> 12:42.200]  This feels just like a Canon.
[12:42.200 --> 12:46.480]  But really, it's like Canoon or whatever on the label.
[12:46.480 --> 12:47.840]  And it happened all the time.
[12:47.840 --> 12:48.600]  It was crazy.
[12:48.600 --> 12:50.520]  It was this thing I had no idea about until I
[12:50.520 --> 12:52.280]  started working in that business.
[12:52.280 --> 12:54.440]  And I think there's some products out there
[12:54.440 --> 12:55.400]  that are that way.
[12:55.400 --> 12:56.360]  You could see them.
[12:56.360 --> 12:58.000]  They pop up now and then.
[12:58.000 --> 13:02.400]  And you could tell, hey, there's absolutely no reason for this
[13:02.400 --> 13:05.360]  to weigh the way it does, because they're
[13:05.360 --> 13:08.320]  trying to impart some sense of quality in this.
[13:08.320 --> 13:10.160]  But in reality, you open it up, and it's like,
[13:10.160 --> 13:11.720]  oh, it's just a weight in here to make
[13:11.720 --> 13:13.640]  it seem like it's good, right?
[13:13.640 --> 13:18.400]  And there's physical, actual, still products that do that.
[13:18.400 --> 13:21.160]  But then there's also products that do it metaphorically,
[13:21.160 --> 13:23.200]  where you're like, oh, wow, this has the feel of quality,
[13:23.200 --> 13:24.840]  but it's not really quality.
[13:24.840 --> 13:27.920]  And I don't feel that these fall into that category at all.
[13:27.920 --> 13:29.680]  I actually do feel that they are the weight
[13:29.680 --> 13:33.000]  that they are specifically because of the materials that
[13:33.000 --> 13:33.840]  were chosen.
[13:33.840 --> 13:36.480]  And the materials were chosen specifically
[13:36.480 --> 13:39.160]  to impart a feeling of quality.
[13:39.160 --> 13:43.120]  So it's not that they've got a slab of pig metal
[13:43.120 --> 13:44.320]  in each ear cup.
[13:44.320 --> 13:46.600]  They're just heavy because they're like, hey,
[13:46.600 --> 13:49.800]  what's the best material we could possibly use?
[13:49.800 --> 13:53.200]  And the weight consideration is way down the list,
[13:53.200 --> 13:55.840]  way down the list on these particular pair.
[13:55.840 --> 13:59.680]  Yeah, making the cups out of unibody aluminum.
[13:59.680 --> 14:02.440]  I don't know if unibody counts, but it's
[14:02.440 --> 14:06.800]  the outer shell, other than the foam thing,
[14:06.800 --> 14:11.680]  is just one big, round piece of aluminum.
[14:11.680 --> 14:13.280]  Again, I don't know if it's a hunk of metal.
[14:13.280 --> 14:15.160]  It's a hunk of aluminum.
[14:15.160 --> 14:20.000]  And here on the East Coast, in a pretty chilly week
[14:20.000 --> 14:27.120]  in Philadelphia, it is kind of cool, literally cool,
[14:27.120 --> 14:30.280]  and figuratively cool, that when I'd reach up to touch them,
[14:30.280 --> 14:31.960]  they were very cool to the touch,
[14:31.960 --> 14:34.080]  which is not something I'm used to with headphones.
[14:34.080 --> 14:35.520]  And I'm sure there's a whole bunch
[14:35.520 --> 14:39.280]  of high-end German brands of headphones
[14:39.280 --> 14:42.360]  that are made of metal that I don't own.
[14:42.360 --> 14:45.080]  But for these, just sort of wear them
[14:45.080 --> 14:46.880]  while walking around the house, it
[14:46.880 --> 14:52.160]  was really weird to reach up and feel this ice-cool aluminum.
[14:52.160 --> 14:54.720]  And again, they don't make your head cool because your cup,
[14:54.720 --> 14:56.640]  you're, I'm not trying to say like, hey,
[14:56.640 --> 14:59.160]  your head's going to be cold because there's aluminum cups.
[14:59.160 --> 15:02.640]  The aluminum doesn't touch your head.
[15:02.640 --> 15:04.760]  But it really feels premium.
[15:04.760 --> 15:09.720]  And it's very futuristic, too, where
[15:09.720 --> 15:15.600]  it's so smooth and like aluminum eggs on your ears.
[15:15.600 --> 15:19.920]  They're very organically shaped.
[15:19.920 --> 15:21.360]  Yeah, yeah, they are.
[15:21.360 --> 15:30.880]  And I do think that they have a interesting shape
[15:30.880 --> 15:33.520]  on the horizontal axis, I guess you'd call it,
[15:33.520 --> 15:35.080]  like outwards from the head.
[15:35.080 --> 15:39.400]  Because many, many headphones out there, premium headphones,
[15:39.400 --> 15:44.040]  I should say, have a fairly large or deep cavity.
[15:44.040 --> 15:48.440]  And that is sort of a physics thing, partially.
[15:48.440 --> 15:51.200]  They need space for the air to move around
[15:51.200 --> 15:53.760]  and for a bigger driver and all of that, right?
[15:53.760 --> 15:56.280]  But somebody brought this up, and this is obviously
[15:56.280 --> 16:00.560]  not everybody's use case and maybe a fairly minimal use
[16:00.560 --> 16:03.000]  case, but it does typify how these
[16:03.000 --> 16:06.080]  are different from other headphones in the shape, which
[16:06.080 --> 16:09.920]  is that because they're so flat on the outer side
[16:09.920 --> 16:11.800]  and so close to the head, they're
[16:11.800 --> 16:14.560]  actually extremely comfortable to lay down on.
[16:14.560 --> 16:16.240]  Somebody asked me in a Twitter, hey,
[16:16.240 --> 16:19.280]  I wear noise canceling headphones to sleep.
[16:19.280 --> 16:22.240]  I put them on, and I put white noise on or whatever.
[16:22.240 --> 16:24.760]  And I'm like, OK, I get it.
[16:24.760 --> 16:27.920]  Maybe you live in a noisy place, or you're next to the L,
[16:27.920 --> 16:30.200]  and you're like, this is the only way I can get to sleep.
[16:30.200 --> 16:32.400]  Or you have anxiety or whatever, and it helps.
[16:32.400 --> 16:33.860]  But he's like, I lay down on them,
[16:33.860 --> 16:35.760]  because how are they to lay down on?
[16:35.760 --> 16:38.240]  And I know this is an edge case, but it's funny to me
[16:38.240 --> 16:40.480]  that it actually typifies how different they are.
[16:40.480 --> 16:43.520]  Because they are extremely flat and lozenge-shaped,
[16:43.520 --> 16:45.720]  and that lower profile does actually
[16:45.720 --> 16:47.640]  make them easier to lay down on.
[16:47.640 --> 16:51.960]  And while I don't think I'll be sleeping with them on in a bed,
[16:51.960 --> 16:54.200]  I thought to myself, how many times
[16:54.200 --> 16:57.000]  have I been uncomfortable on a plane
[16:57.000 --> 17:01.200]  because I've been trying to lean up against the bulkhead
[17:01.200 --> 17:06.180]  or against a seat rest or turn and rest against a seat rest
[17:06.180 --> 17:09.040]  as best I can in an economy seat or whatever,
[17:09.040 --> 17:13.600]  and it clanks against the thing, and it makes my neck crick.
[17:13.600 --> 17:15.120]  But I need them on, because I can't
[17:15.120 --> 17:18.000]  sleep with the roar and everybody farting around me
[17:18.000 --> 17:18.800]  and all this.
[17:18.800 --> 17:21.920]  And so I'm like, it makes some sense
[17:21.920 --> 17:24.040]  that they're the shape the way they are.
[17:24.040 --> 17:28.520]  It actually is a sort of departure,
[17:28.520 --> 17:32.040]  a left turn from the shape of a lot of premium headphones,
[17:32.040 --> 17:35.280]  which typically look like Lobot a lot.
[17:35.280 --> 17:37.640]  Right, right, right.
[17:37.640 --> 17:41.680]  I brought up the Lobot picture a couple of times.
[17:41.680 --> 17:44.240]  And I'm like, yeah, see, those look cool.
[17:44.240 --> 17:45.800]  Lobot looks really cool.
[17:45.800 --> 17:48.000]  But it's like, yeah, he's got all these blinking lights,
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.200]  and there's a lot of articulation,
[17:50.200 --> 17:54.280]  and there's a lot of levels, just layers of stuff.
[17:54.280 --> 18:00.360]  And these are just smooth.
[18:00.360 --> 18:02.360]  Yeah, yeah.
[18:02.360 --> 18:06.400]  The smoothness, the egg shape, the kind of flatness of them,
[18:06.400 --> 18:08.760]  I think a lot of it, all of it adds up
[18:08.760 --> 18:10.800]  to a nice differentiation in design.
[18:10.800 --> 18:15.200]  I think it's not as evident until you really bring up
[18:15.200 --> 18:19.040]  a list, and you kind of, I open a few tabs of all of the,
[18:19.040 --> 18:23.080]  I really, this is probably another part of this discussion,
[18:23.080 --> 18:24.880]  but I'm really not interested in comparing
[18:24.880 --> 18:27.160]  these against non-noise cancellation headphones.
[18:27.160 --> 18:27.680]  Right.
[18:27.680 --> 18:29.240]  Because I think that's just, if you're
[18:29.240 --> 18:33.680]  getting into non-NC studio monitor headphones,
[18:33.680 --> 18:35.280]  it's just a different conversation.
[18:35.280 --> 18:37.680]  And I don't feel that it's fair or necessary to have
[18:37.680 --> 18:39.200]  that conversation personally.
[18:39.200 --> 18:41.200]  I'm sure people will have that conversation,
[18:41.200 --> 18:43.600]  oh, let me compare them against my $6,000 reference
[18:43.600 --> 18:47.560]  headphones with no NC, direct path of the audio
[18:47.560 --> 18:49.160]  straight through with no processing.
[18:49.160 --> 18:50.600]  It's just not that, right?
[18:50.600 --> 18:53.240]  But if you open up all of the NC headphones that
[18:53.240 --> 18:56.560]  are in this price range, or even more expensive, some of them
[18:56.560 --> 19:00.400]  are, or a little bit less, but certainly not cheap,
[19:00.400 --> 19:04.800]  it's a departure, a great departure in ID
[19:04.800 --> 19:07.320]  from all of those headphones, which are largely
[19:07.320 --> 19:13.040]  black and brown, some silver, with a lot of bulk
[19:13.040 --> 19:19.520]  and a lot of very, for lack of a better term,
[19:19.520 --> 19:22.440]  90s Sony design aesthetic.
[19:22.440 --> 19:23.760]  You know what I mean?
[19:23.760 --> 19:26.440]  Headphones are really stuck in that universe a lot.
[19:26.440 --> 19:29.280]  And I think Beats did a lot to change that conversation
[19:29.280 --> 19:30.760]  in that they're like, hey, headphones
[19:30.760 --> 19:31.840]  are a fashion accessory.
[19:31.840 --> 19:33.340]  And certainly there are other brands.
[19:33.340 --> 19:36.240]  I'm not saying that only Apple affiliated brands have done
[19:36.240 --> 19:36.740]  this.
[19:36.740 --> 19:38.480]  Skullcandy springs to mind.
[19:38.480 --> 19:40.900]  They're cheap headphones, but they changed the conversation
[19:40.900 --> 19:41.800]  around how they look.
[19:41.800 --> 19:43.400]  But of course, of course, of course,
[19:43.400 --> 19:45.200]  you cannot talk about any of this
[19:45.200 --> 19:47.960]  without saying that the Apple earbuds really
[19:47.960 --> 19:51.560]  changed the game as far as headphones becoming
[19:51.560 --> 19:54.280]  a thing that people looked at and cared about,
[19:54.280 --> 19:56.640]  versus just used, right?
[19:56.640 --> 20:00.440]  And they certainly, if you had those white earbuds
[20:00.440 --> 20:03.320]  with the dangly thread, people knew what you were up to.
[20:03.320 --> 20:05.400]  And they knew that you had an iPod.
[20:05.400 --> 20:07.840]  And that was the status symbol, for sure.
[20:07.840 --> 20:12.640]  And I think these are in that same conversation, you know?
[20:12.640 --> 20:14.560]  Yeah.
[20:14.560 --> 20:15.440]  I agree.
[20:15.440 --> 20:19.920]  I mean, and again, I have not done anything even vaguely
[20:19.920 --> 20:24.200]  like a deep dive on noise canceling headphones.
[20:24.200 --> 20:28.640]  And I know people love the Sony, is it MX series, QX?
[20:28.640 --> 20:30.160]  I don't know what the hell they are.
[20:30.160 --> 20:33.840]  But there's the Sony one that's in that 200-some price range
[20:33.840 --> 20:35.560]  that people really love, where they
[20:35.560 --> 20:37.560]  say the noise canceling is great,
[20:37.560 --> 20:41.560]  and the audio quality is superior than the Bose,
[20:41.560 --> 20:44.440]  say many.
[20:44.440 --> 20:46.240]  I got the Bose.
[20:46.240 --> 20:48.200]  My family makes fun of me because I actually
[20:48.200 --> 20:49.360]  bought them at the airport.
[20:52.200 --> 20:52.920]  You're the guy.
[20:52.920 --> 20:53.600]  You're the guy.
[20:53.600 --> 20:55.440]  You're the reason that they sell them at the airport.
[20:55.440 --> 20:56.080]  I got it.
[20:56.080 --> 20:58.120]  Right.
[20:58.120 --> 21:01.000]  I forget where we were going two or three years ago,
[21:01.000 --> 21:02.920]  and I got through security.
[21:02.920 --> 21:11.640]  And I forget what the story was, but I had broken a pair,
[21:11.640 --> 21:14.200]  the headband of a pair a year or two earlier,
[21:14.200 --> 21:16.240]  and I'd been putting off getting a new pair.
[21:16.240 --> 21:17.640]  And I was like, to hell with this.
[21:17.640 --> 21:19.940]  I'm not going on this flight without noise canceling
[21:19.940 --> 21:20.680]  headphones.
[21:20.680 --> 21:26.040]  And I knew there was just your typical airport place
[21:26.040 --> 21:28.280]  where you buy Bose headphones.
[21:28.280 --> 21:29.000]  And I did.
[21:29.000 --> 21:32.400]  I did quick Google like, well, what are they?
[21:32.400 --> 21:34.000]  What do they cost at Amazon?
[21:34.000 --> 21:35.720]  And it was like the same price.
[21:35.720 --> 21:39.040]  It was like $270.
[21:39.040 --> 21:40.320]  And I'm like, so who cares?
[21:40.320 --> 21:41.280]  I'm buying them there.
[21:41.280 --> 21:43.360]  It wasn't like the $70 sushi, right?
[21:43.360 --> 21:45.120]  It was basically the same price, yeah.
[21:45.120 --> 21:45.720]  Right.
[21:45.720 --> 21:49.320]  It was a perfectly fair price to pay for a pair of Bose
[21:49.320 --> 21:50.600]  quite comfort, too.
[21:50.600 --> 21:55.520]  And my wife and son still do not let me hear the end of it.
[21:55.520 --> 21:59.240]  But once you have them, it just drives me crazy.
[21:59.240 --> 22:00.360]  And I wrote my review.
[22:00.360 --> 22:04.200]  I often use it if I'm writing something or just reading,
[22:04.200 --> 22:07.240]  just reading a book, I will put my noise canceling headphones
[22:07.240 --> 22:11.320]  on, have them play nothing just to have the noise canceling.
[22:11.320 --> 22:15.640]  Because it is an overall better experience
[22:15.640 --> 22:18.120]  to have headphones on playing nothing,
[22:18.120 --> 22:22.320]  but canceling out the, to me, rather unpleasant white noise
[22:22.320 --> 22:26.560]  of an airplane cabin than to sit there and listen to it, right?
[22:26.560 --> 22:27.680]  So what do you get?
[22:27.680 --> 22:31.440]  You get better audio when you're playing nothing,
[22:31.440 --> 22:35.360]  but just have more like closer to pure silence,
[22:35.360 --> 22:41.320]  but the physical discomfort of wearing the headphones.
[22:41.320 --> 22:43.240]  I will take that trade off any day of the week.
[22:43.240 --> 22:47.680]  And then if you actually are watching a movie
[22:47.680 --> 22:50.720]  or listening to music or listening to a podcast,
[22:50.720 --> 22:55.920]  it's almost unusable to me not to have noise canceling.
[22:55.920 --> 22:58.040]  Because you have to turn the volume up so high,
[22:58.040 --> 23:00.560]  it's like you should be getting a warning
[23:00.560 --> 23:03.200]  that you're listening to it too loud to hear it
[23:03.200 --> 23:06.280]  over the cabin noise.
[23:06.280 --> 23:11.920]  So I'm a fan, but I'm not an expert on the 20 different brands
[23:11.920 --> 23:14.160]  of them.
[23:14.160 --> 23:16.080]  Doing it in the winter was pretty interesting.
[23:16.080 --> 23:21.240]  My office here at the house has pretty loud heat
[23:21.240 --> 23:23.480]  when the heat's on.
[23:23.480 --> 23:28.000]  And especially, it's a little bit of serendipity
[23:28.000 --> 23:31.560]  and a little bit of maybe just, well,
[23:31.560 --> 23:34.760]  it makes sense that the vent was placed over there
[23:34.760 --> 23:37.200]  and the windows were over here.
[23:37.200 --> 23:43.560]  But I just sat down closer to where it's noisier.
[23:43.560 --> 23:45.040]  What else did I test it with?
[23:45.040 --> 23:45.680]  The oven.
[23:45.680 --> 23:48.560]  So like when Amy was baking something
[23:48.560 --> 23:53.240]  and turned on the, what do you call the thing that
[23:53.240 --> 23:55.520]  takes the exhaust out of an oven?
[23:55.520 --> 23:57.120]  The hood.
[23:57.120 --> 23:57.920]  The hood, yes.
[23:57.920 --> 23:59.280]  Oh, no, the vent, yeah.
[23:59.280 --> 23:59.960]  The vent.
[23:59.960 --> 24:04.440]  You turn this on and it sucks up the stuff.
[24:04.440 --> 24:06.560]  But it's good white noise.
[24:06.560 --> 24:07.880]  And it's like, boy, they work.
[24:07.880 --> 24:09.920]  And that's the best I could do, you know what I mean?
[24:09.920 --> 24:14.000]  I'm not going on an airplane ride in the 24 hours I've had them.
[24:14.000 --> 24:14.840]  Right, right, yeah.
[24:14.840 --> 24:17.880]  The noise canceling seems great.
[24:17.880 --> 24:19.640]  Yeah.
[24:19.640 --> 24:20.280]  It's good.
[24:20.280 --> 24:21.000]  It's good.
[24:21.000 --> 24:25.280]  I mean, I do believe that there's a couple of things,
[24:25.280 --> 24:26.920]  a couple of natural advantages that it
[24:26.920 --> 24:28.560]  has over something like an in-ear.
[24:28.560 --> 24:33.880]  I mean, an in-ear, you're fighting with an in-ear.
[24:33.880 --> 24:36.120]  I'm talking like versus an over-ear headphone.
[24:36.120 --> 24:41.480]  You're fighting the fact that the in-ear has a natural seal.
[24:41.480 --> 24:45.680]  So it already blocks more noise than an over-ear,
[24:45.680 --> 24:50.800]  typically, because of the foam and the gap between the foam
[24:50.800 --> 24:51.320]  in the ear.
[24:51.320 --> 24:54.160]  And kind of naturally, you're going to hear more sound.
[24:54.160 --> 24:57.680]  So the in-ear already has a better natural seal.
[24:57.680 --> 25:00.080]  But I would guess that just comparing it, say,
[25:00.080 --> 25:01.880]  because I have QuietComfort 2s, which
[25:01.880 --> 25:05.560]  is they've traveled all over the world with me
[25:05.560 --> 25:08.800]  and do very well in an airplane setting.
[25:08.800 --> 25:11.200]  They have less hiss and low frequency noise
[25:11.200 --> 25:12.760]  than a Beats Studio.
[25:12.760 --> 25:16.480]  I have not tried the Sony MX series, which a lot of people
[25:16.480 --> 25:18.520]  swear by over the Bose.
[25:18.520 --> 25:20.640]  So I can't speak to personal experience there.
[25:20.640 --> 25:24.440]  But they definitely, the QC2s are way better
[25:24.440 --> 25:27.680]  than the Beats Studio for me, for noise cancellation
[25:27.680 --> 25:28.720]  purposes.
[25:28.720 --> 25:32.560]  And sound is more neutral, too, which I actually prefer.
[25:32.560 --> 25:37.960]  But the AirPods Pro, obviously, their noise cancellation,
[25:37.960 --> 25:39.720]  quite good for an earbud.
[25:39.720 --> 25:41.520]  I mean, pretty stellar for an earbud.
[25:41.520 --> 25:44.400]  But I would consider them a little less than the QC2
[25:44.400 --> 25:46.040]  in terms of efficacy.
[25:46.040 --> 25:52.080]  And I consider the AirPods Max to be above both of those.
[25:52.080 --> 25:55.480]  So I think that's the scale for me, is that the QC2s are good.
[25:55.480 --> 25:59.800]  But the AirPods Max do provide superior noise cancellation
[25:59.800 --> 26:03.520]  in terms of blocking low frequency and sharp sounds.
[26:03.520 --> 26:05.280]  Sharp sounds, especially, are very hard
[26:05.280 --> 26:08.160]  for noise cancellation because they're bursts of sound.
[26:08.160 --> 26:12.880]  They kind of pierce the NC white noise frequency.
[26:12.880 --> 26:17.880]  But the Max does a better job at sharp sound stuff,
[26:17.880 --> 26:21.240]  like clinking glasses, snapping fingers, stuff like that.
[26:21.240 --> 26:23.800]  I found it does a little better job.
[26:23.800 --> 26:26.320]  So I've been pretty happy with the noise cancellation
[26:26.320 --> 26:30.960]  efficiency, whatever efficacy of these.
[26:30.960 --> 26:31.800]  I think they're good.
[26:31.800 --> 26:34.360]  I think they dull a lot of rustling
[26:34.360 --> 26:38.720]  and a lot of kind of mid-frequency sound very, very
[26:38.720 --> 26:42.240]  well, which is a lot of the stuff that distracts, typically.
[26:42.240 --> 26:44.360]  Just the low hum of life around you,
[26:44.360 --> 26:47.120]  it kind of cuts that out pretty well.
[26:47.120 --> 26:49.800]  The other thing, I tested the first day I had him.
[26:49.800 --> 26:50.600]  I wore him a lot.
[26:50.600 --> 26:54.280]  And I actually had to run out to get some groceries.
[26:54.280 --> 26:59.840]  And so rather than wear my usual AirPods Pro
[26:59.840 --> 27:01.520]  to listen to podcasts while I do this,
[27:01.520 --> 27:05.440]  I wore the AirPods Max, which I ordinarily wouldn't do.
[27:05.440 --> 27:08.600]  But I realized that they do kind of work.
[27:08.600 --> 27:09.720]  It wasn't freezing cold.
[27:09.720 --> 27:10.300]  I don't know.
[27:10.300 --> 27:13.280]  It was like in the 30s here in Philly.
[27:13.280 --> 27:19.760]  But it was sort of like having earmuffs on.
[27:19.760 --> 27:21.560]  Rather than wear a hat, it was like, hey,
[27:21.560 --> 27:24.560]  my ears aren't getting cold.
[27:24.560 --> 27:29.480]  But then I realized it was like, huh.
[27:29.480 --> 27:31.400]  And then all of a sudden, I had to take them off,
[27:31.400 --> 27:34.080]  put my mask on, and then put them back on.
[27:34.080 --> 27:36.640]  Yes, definitely not as convenient there.
[27:36.640 --> 27:37.920]  Same thing, yeah.
[27:37.920 --> 27:41.480]  But when I leave, I don't take the mask off.
[27:41.480 --> 27:43.680]  It's like I mask up in the house, leave,
[27:43.680 --> 27:46.080]  and I don't have to take the mask off
[27:46.080 --> 27:47.080]  while I'm in the store.
[27:47.080 --> 27:49.160]  I'm not taking free samples or anything like that.
[27:49.160 --> 27:52.920]  So when you're using earbuds, you
[27:52.920 --> 27:57.560]  don't have to worry about which order you mask up.
[27:57.560 --> 27:58.240]  It is valid.
[27:58.240 --> 27:59.480]  It's valid to point out.
[27:59.480 --> 28:00.920]  I mean, I ran into the same thing.
[28:00.920 --> 28:02.720]  I was running to take a package to the store.
[28:02.720 --> 28:06.720]  But because I live in a driving city, not a walking city,
[28:06.720 --> 28:08.560]  I don't wear my mask in my car.
[28:08.560 --> 28:11.000]  And I don't wear my mask when I leave the house.
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.760]  So obviously, yes, you're probably
[28:13.760 --> 28:14.720]  not going to be driving.
[28:14.720 --> 28:16.680]  Most people are not going to be driving around
[28:16.680 --> 28:17.600]  with these things on.
[28:17.600 --> 28:19.480]  But just as a test, and because I'm
[28:19.480 --> 28:21.960]  trying to get as much listen time as possible,
[28:21.960 --> 28:22.760]  I wore them out.
[28:22.760 --> 28:24.840]  And yeah, you have to do the juggling thing, where
[28:24.840 --> 28:27.760]  you lift them and put a mask loop on,
[28:27.760 --> 28:29.880]  and lift the other side, put a mask loop on,
[28:29.880 --> 28:31.760]  all of that stuff to get it on and off.
[28:31.760 --> 28:33.520]  I've mentioned this many times.
[28:33.520 --> 28:34.600]  I write about it.
[28:34.600 --> 28:39.000]  And maybe it's a neurotic aspect of my personality.
[28:39.000 --> 28:44.880]  But for years, I mean, going back to the wired earbuds era,
[28:44.880 --> 28:48.120]  I've always listened to podcasts when I'm out running errands.
[28:48.120 --> 28:53.680]  And living in the city, I've run almost all errands on foot.
[28:53.680 --> 28:56.480]  So it's not like I'm driving while listening to something
[28:56.480 --> 28:59.360]  with headphones on.
[28:59.360 --> 29:03.480]  And whenever I check out, or if I'm at the butcher counter
[29:03.480 --> 29:08.080]  and I'm ordering some meat, I take the buds out of my ear,
[29:08.080 --> 29:10.280]  or at least one of them out of my ear.
[29:10.280 --> 29:15.840]  Even if my audio is paused as a social signal
[29:15.840 --> 29:18.800]  to the person I'm dealing with, that you've
[29:18.800 --> 29:22.040]  got my audio attention.
[29:22.040 --> 29:25.880]  And the conundrum I've been in since AirPods Pro come out
[29:25.880 --> 29:32.160]  is that I hear better with my podcast paused and transparency
[29:32.160 --> 29:35.760]  on than I do if I take one out.
[29:35.760 --> 29:38.520]  And the whole taking one out thing,
[29:38.520 --> 29:49.360]  like the problem era of the problem era of my life
[29:49.360 --> 29:51.880]  was the regular AirPods era.
[29:51.880 --> 29:54.840]  Because what do you do with the one you take out, right?
[29:54.840 --> 29:57.280]  It's like, now you've got a delicate little thing.
[29:57.280 --> 29:59.680]  You're going to set it down on a dirty counter, or no?
[29:59.680 --> 30:00.360]  You're not going to do that.
[30:00.360 --> 30:02.880]  Put it in your pocket, and then the sensors get covered,
[30:02.880 --> 30:03.920]  and it starts playing.
[30:03.920 --> 30:04.760]  It's just awkward.
[30:04.760 --> 30:06.520]  What do I do with it?
[30:06.520 --> 30:07.280]  Exactly.
[30:07.280 --> 30:08.040]  Exactly.
[30:08.040 --> 30:10.840]  It's like my coat pocket, I feel, is clean enough,
[30:10.840 --> 30:12.920]  or I would do it, but you can put it in there,
[30:12.920 --> 30:15.840]  and it thinks it's in a, I don't know, it gets confused,
[30:15.840 --> 30:18.920]  thinks your ear canal is, well, OK, his ears got bigger,
[30:18.920 --> 30:20.320]  but start playing.
[30:20.320 --> 30:21.320]  Right.
[30:23.920 --> 30:27.360]  So transparency, technically, is a huge win.
[30:27.360 --> 30:33.640]  It actually does, it is a superpower.
[30:33.640 --> 30:36.880]  I think we're such a visual species
[30:36.880 --> 30:39.400]  that we tend to think of augmented reality
[30:39.400 --> 30:41.080]  as being primarily visual.
[30:41.080 --> 30:45.240]  But we as a technology civilization
[30:45.240 --> 30:48.240]  are clearly ahead of the game on the audio side.
[30:48.240 --> 30:50.400]  These are augmented reality.
[30:50.400 --> 30:53.800]  And for me, again, in my hearing,
[30:53.800 --> 30:56.320]  I get an annual physical, my hearing,
[30:56.320 --> 30:59.080]  I get a two thumbs up every year with the hearing test.
[30:59.080 --> 31:01.440]  You hear the beeps, beep, left, right?
[31:01.440 --> 31:06.000]  So my hearing is good, but I definitely,
[31:06.000 --> 31:09.520]  in a grocery store with that white noise, background
[31:09.520 --> 31:11.720]  noise of a grocery store, I hear better
[31:11.720 --> 31:16.040]  with transparency talking to the clerk or the deli person
[31:16.040 --> 31:18.120]  than I do taking them out.
[31:18.120 --> 31:22.360]  But it looks like I'm listening to music or a podcast, right?
[31:22.360 --> 31:25.680]  Like I wish that there was some, I don't know what it would be.
[31:25.680 --> 31:27.360]  Like a flashing light, obviously,
[31:27.360 --> 31:28.960]  isn't going to happen.
[31:28.960 --> 31:33.400]  But like a red light, you're on air now with me.
[31:33.400 --> 31:33.880]  Right.
[31:36.760 --> 31:39.320]  We're on the line, caller, welcome.
[31:39.320 --> 31:42.000]  Yeah, like a red T, like transparency mode.
[31:42.000 --> 31:45.440]  This person is paying attention to you.
[31:45.440 --> 31:47.200]  But it's way worse with over ears, right?
[31:47.200 --> 31:49.000]  Like the whole social signal with over ears.
[31:49.000 --> 31:50.920]  It's like, fuck you, don't talk to me.
[31:50.920 --> 31:54.320]  Oh, pardon my French, but you know, don't talk to me.
[31:54.320 --> 31:55.200]  You lost.
[31:55.200 --> 31:57.480]  That's what I look like going to the grocery store.
[31:57.480 --> 32:01.080]  And I know, and I wanted to like, I love this story.
[32:01.080 --> 32:02.840]  You ever hear the story about the car?
[32:02.840 --> 32:04.460]  I don't know if he still carries them,
[32:04.460 --> 32:07.760]  but that Steve Martin carries around cards that say,
[32:07.760 --> 32:09.520]  like when people come up and they're like,
[32:09.520 --> 32:11.720]  hey, you're Steve Martin, can I have your autograph?
[32:11.720 --> 32:14.320]  He has these cards in his pocket that he gives out.
[32:14.320 --> 32:16.360]  And it's a card that just says, this card
[32:16.360 --> 32:18.560]  certifies that you have met Steve Martin.
[32:20.600 --> 32:22.720]  And then the transaction's over,
[32:22.720 --> 32:24.560]  he doesn't have to sign anything.
[32:24.560 --> 32:26.520]  And people, you know, they've got, you know,
[32:26.520 --> 32:28.920]  and it's charming and funny, and oh so Steve Martin.
[32:28.920 --> 32:31.160]  Yeah, they've got a memento, a physical memento
[32:31.160 --> 32:33.400]  that's so much better even than a autograph
[32:33.400 --> 32:35.080]  on some random slip of paper or whatever.
[32:35.080 --> 32:38.760]  Right, I felt like I needed to take cards around that say,
[32:38.760 --> 32:41.520]  I'm listening to you in transparency mode
[32:41.520 --> 32:43.400]  with these headphones, and you've got
[32:43.400 --> 32:45.000]  my full audio attention.
[32:45.000 --> 32:47.680]  But I really felt like I needed it yesterday,
[32:47.680 --> 32:52.520]  or the day before when I had these over-the-ear cans on.
[32:52.520 --> 32:54.640]  And it's like, I want you to know,
[32:54.640 --> 32:57.200]  A, I want you to know I hear you loud and clear,
[32:57.200 --> 32:59.600]  but B, also, I really kind of need
[32:59.600 --> 33:03.360]  to test these in the next 24 hours, and this is it.
[33:03.360 --> 33:05.040]  I'm not just that guy.
[33:05.040 --> 33:06.440]  Right.
[33:06.440 --> 33:07.280]  Yeah.
[33:07.280 --> 33:09.560]  I did, when I checked out, I couldn't do it though.
[33:09.560 --> 33:12.760]  I put them down around my neck, and that's
[33:12.760 --> 33:15.400]  when I realized that if you leave them,
[33:15.400 --> 33:17.840]  if you take them off your ears long enough,
[33:17.840 --> 33:19.240]  they stop playing.
[33:22.840 --> 33:24.320]  Which brings us to the fact that they
[33:24.320 --> 33:28.040]  don't have an on-off switch, which is a very Apple-like
[33:28.040 --> 33:29.520]  design choice.
[33:29.520 --> 33:31.920]  Yeah, and I think there's some confusion about that.
[33:31.920 --> 33:33.880]  I know some of the early reviewers,
[33:33.880 --> 33:38.000]  or early looks that were published,
[33:38.000 --> 33:39.440]  people seemed confused about that
[33:39.440 --> 33:43.760]  and thought that the only way to stop them from draining,
[33:43.760 --> 33:47.320]  essentially, at full power, like they're on,
[33:47.320 --> 33:49.120]  is to put them in the case.
[33:49.120 --> 33:52.520]  Which does, if you say, if you assume
[33:52.520 --> 33:55.040]  that that's the only way to turn them off fully,
[33:55.040 --> 33:56.960]  that is kind of annoying, right?
[33:56.960 --> 33:59.080]  Hey, I got to use this case at all times,
[33:59.080 --> 34:03.320]  unless I want my headphones to drain completely
[34:03.320 --> 34:07.160]  over the course of 10 hours or whatever.
[34:07.160 --> 34:08.720]  But that's not true.
[34:08.720 --> 34:11.600]  So the case is, it puts them into what
[34:11.600 --> 34:15.920]  they call an ultra low power mode, which
[34:15.920 --> 34:20.240]  is, the way I compare this is, if you take the headphones off,
[34:20.240 --> 34:22.200]  actually, let me run it through, because this
[34:22.200 --> 34:23.280]  is a couple of things that I picked up.
[34:23.280 --> 34:24.840]  So if you take the headphones off,
[34:24.840 --> 34:26.440]  immediately they stop playing.
[34:26.440 --> 34:28.720]  Just ear detection, or head detection.
[34:28.720 --> 34:30.920]  The sensor inside says, hey, this isn't on an ear.
[34:30.920 --> 34:31.680]  I'm going to stop.
[34:31.680 --> 34:32.640]  That's an AirPods thing.
[34:32.640 --> 34:34.000]  All the AirPods do that.
[34:34.000 --> 34:37.000]  Then after about 15 seconds or so,
[34:37.000 --> 34:41.200]  they actually shut down the connection between the device
[34:41.200 --> 34:43.200]  that it was connected to and the headphones.
[34:43.200 --> 34:45.080]  So that saves a ton more power, right?
[34:45.080 --> 34:47.000]  Because it says, hey, I'm no longer connected
[34:47.000 --> 34:47.560]  to this phone.
[34:47.560 --> 34:49.160]  I'm just going to go, you know, you're not playing anything
[34:49.160 --> 34:50.440]  from the phone right now.
[34:50.440 --> 34:51.400]  I'm not on your head.
[34:51.400 --> 34:53.560]  And in fact, maybe I'm still, because remember,
[34:53.560 --> 34:55.720]  the H1s have accelerometers in them.
[34:55.720 --> 34:58.320]  It says, I'm going to chill out and cut off this connection,
[34:58.320 --> 35:00.400]  because that's using up power that's not necessary.
[35:00.400 --> 35:03.920]  And then I believe there's one more stage of sort
[35:03.920 --> 35:07.400]  of hibernation that is not, you know, it's essentially
[35:07.400 --> 35:09.960]  what you would call a low power mode.
[35:09.960 --> 35:12.520]  And so the difference between that state
[35:12.520 --> 35:15.240]  and what you're talking about with the case,
[35:15.240 --> 35:18.640]  the way that I've come to think of it is that it's like,
[35:18.640 --> 35:23.520]  I'm asleep versus I'm in, versus I'm in carbonite, right?
[35:23.520 --> 35:25.280]  I'm frozen in carbonite.
[35:25.280 --> 35:29.960]  If you're frozen in carbonite, you're alive, but barely.
[35:29.960 --> 35:31.160]  Isn't that the phrase?
[35:31.160 --> 35:31.840]  Is he alive?
[35:31.840 --> 35:32.360]  Barely.
[35:32.360 --> 35:32.960]  I don't know.
[35:32.960 --> 35:34.920]  But I can't remember.
[35:34.920 --> 35:36.120]  That's the basic states.
[35:36.120 --> 35:41.280]  Like, it's carbonite frozen, but the only sensor that's on
[35:41.280 --> 35:44.400]  is, is this in the case or not?
[35:44.400 --> 35:45.880]  That's pretty much the only sensor
[35:45.880 --> 35:48.240]  that's alive in the headphones when it's in a case,
[35:48.240 --> 35:50.480]  which is why it can last so long once it's in there.
[35:50.480 --> 35:53.000]  And it's obviously just a magnet that says, hey, yo,
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.360]  you're in this case, just like the iPad Smart Cover.
[35:55.360 --> 35:58.240]  But then when you take them out, and you wear them,
[35:58.240 --> 36:00.400]  and then you take them off, and you set them down,
[36:00.400 --> 36:03.680]  they go into a state that, yes, we'll use more battery than is
[36:03.680 --> 36:08.040]  in the case, but it's not the same thing as on, right?
[36:08.040 --> 36:13.880]  And this whole disambiguation of the term on or off
[36:13.880 --> 36:14.720]  is very Apple.
[36:14.720 --> 36:19.560]  Like, what does on even mean in a world with low-power chips,
[36:19.560 --> 36:20.040]  right?
[36:20.040 --> 36:22.560]  Like, you can see the philosophical conversation
[36:22.560 --> 36:25.080]  happening in the audio department at Apple
[36:25.080 --> 36:27.200]  where they're like, but what does on even mean?
[36:27.200 --> 36:28.280]  What is on?
[36:28.280 --> 36:30.320]  What is off, right?
[36:30.320 --> 36:33.080]  But I think that's where some of the confusion came from,
[36:33.080 --> 36:34.840]  which is not too surprising.
[36:34.840 --> 36:38.240]  If you make assumptions that, hey, the case puts them
[36:38.240 --> 36:40.080]  into the lowest power mode possible,
[36:40.080 --> 36:41.760]  and there's no off switch, maybe they
[36:41.760 --> 36:43.360]  don't get turned off until you put them in the case.
[36:43.360 --> 36:45.440]  But that's not technically true.
[36:45.440 --> 36:47.360]  There's shades of off there.
[36:47.360 --> 36:50.200]  Yeah, and it's also the exact sort of thing
[36:50.200 --> 36:53.600]  that by its nature is extremely difficult to write
[36:53.600 --> 36:58.120]  about within 24 or 36 hours of getting them
[36:58.120 --> 37:01.200]  if you're going to spend most of your waking hours
[37:01.200 --> 37:05.200]  in those 24 hours using them.
[37:05.200 --> 37:06.480]  So here's what I did.
[37:06.480 --> 37:08.080]  I actually should have written it down.
[37:08.080 --> 37:12.440]  I believe when I went to put them down last night,
[37:12.440 --> 37:14.320]  I put them down outside the case.
[37:14.320 --> 37:16.360]  And I think they were at 81%.
[37:16.360 --> 37:20.160]  And I just looked right now as you were speaking.
[37:20.160 --> 37:22.480]  They're at 74%.
[37:22.480 --> 37:24.320]  So don't quote me on that.
[37:24.320 --> 37:26.160]  It was somewhere around 80%.
[37:26.160 --> 37:33.200]  So maybe they lost 5% of their power over the last 14 hours.
[37:33.200 --> 37:36.320]  So I could give you a little bit more accuracy on that.
[37:36.320 --> 37:39.040]  I ran essentially the same test.
[37:39.040 --> 37:45.480]  And so I think about 4 PM to 4.30 PM yesterday,
[37:45.480 --> 37:49.320]  I had charged them full and then unplugged them.
[37:49.320 --> 37:52.440]  And then I used them for maybe a handful of minutes.
[37:52.440 --> 37:54.360]  And then after work, I had to cook dinner
[37:54.360 --> 37:55.280]  and all of that stuff.
[37:55.280 --> 37:57.440]  So I actually didn't use them much last night.
[37:57.440 --> 38:02.280]  So I actually took them off, set them on my desk around 5 PM,
[38:02.280 --> 38:04.640]  and left them there all night.
[38:04.640 --> 38:10.800]  So that's over 12 hours, almost 14, 15 hours, almost 20 hours
[38:10.800 --> 38:11.880]  now.
[38:11.880 --> 38:15.800]  When we started this call, which was, let's say,
[38:15.800 --> 38:18.800]  about 40 minutes ago, I put them on
[38:18.800 --> 38:20.360]  and started using them for this call.
[38:20.360 --> 38:22.800]  I'm using them right now to listen to this call
[38:22.800 --> 38:24.000]  or to listen to you.
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.440]  And they are at 96%.
[38:26.440 --> 38:30.800]  So whatever power they're using overnight,
[38:30.800 --> 38:34.040]  they're not on in the traditional sense.
[38:34.040 --> 38:36.760]  Or sorry, whatever power they're using laying on a desk
[38:36.760 --> 38:39.080]  or off your head, but not in a case.
[38:39.080 --> 38:40.600]  I did not put them in the case.
[38:40.600 --> 38:44.280]  So I think that's a pretty easy tell that they're definitely
[38:44.280 --> 38:46.520]  not on, on.
[38:46.520 --> 38:48.640]  Let me take a break and thank our first sponsor.
[38:48.640 --> 38:51.040]  It's our good friends at Mack Weldon.
[38:51.040 --> 38:52.840]  I did not cook the books on this.
[38:52.840 --> 38:54.920]  The fix is not in.
[38:54.920 --> 38:57.120]  But I didn't even know that they were
[38:57.120 --> 38:59.480]  going to be sponsoring this episode until I came down
[38:59.480 --> 39:00.560]  and I was already dressed.
[39:00.560 --> 39:04.960]  I'm wearing a Mack Weldon waffle shirt, and then on top of it,
[39:04.960 --> 39:06.920]  a Mack Weldon hoodie.
[39:06.920 --> 39:09.720]  As I record this read, I do.
[39:09.720 --> 39:13.000]  I wear their stuff and love it.
[39:13.000 --> 39:16.360]  When it comes to holiday gifting for guys,
[39:16.360 --> 39:18.000]  they've got a lot of stuff.
[39:18.000 --> 39:19.840]  And you've got time, if you order,
[39:19.840 --> 39:21.820]  as you listen to this when it's new,
[39:21.820 --> 39:23.660]  you could definitely get some stuff delivered
[39:23.660 --> 39:25.540]  in time for the holidays.
[39:25.540 --> 39:27.440]  Mack Weldon sells men's basics that
[39:27.440 --> 39:30.440]  are guaranteed to keep everyone on your list comfortable.
[39:30.440 --> 39:32.080]  Their stuff is great.
[39:32.080 --> 39:33.400]  I love the style of it.
[39:33.400 --> 39:35.200]  I love the fit of it.
[39:35.200 --> 39:36.940]  I love the way it lasts.
[39:36.940 --> 39:38.900]  I don't even know which of my stuff from them
[39:38.900 --> 39:41.320]  is my older stuff from a year or two back
[39:41.320 --> 39:44.800]  and which is the stuff I've bought recently.
[39:44.800 --> 39:47.360]  They started with stuff like the under the clothes stuff
[39:47.360 --> 39:51.840]  like hoodies, or not hoodies, underwear and undershirts
[39:51.840 --> 39:53.400]  and socks.
[39:53.400 --> 39:54.400]  But they have everything.
[39:54.400 --> 39:55.280]  They've got polos.
[39:55.280 --> 39:56.140]  They've got hoodies.
[39:56.140 --> 39:58.540]  The hoodie I'm wearing right now, I absolutely love.
[39:58.540 --> 40:00.000]  It's one of my favorites.
[40:00.000 --> 40:03.280]  My son has the same hoodie in a slightly smaller size.
[40:03.280 --> 40:04.740]  He loves it, too.
[40:04.740 --> 40:07.680]  Really, it's just great stuff.
[40:07.680 --> 40:10.160]  Just really, really great stuff.
[40:10.160 --> 40:11.880]  Don't even get me started on the slippers.
[40:11.880 --> 40:13.640]  Merlin and I, a couple episodes ago,
[40:13.640 --> 40:14.980]  told you all about the slippers.
[40:14.980 --> 40:16.720]  But the slippers, I mean, for God's sake,
[40:16.720 --> 40:20.000]  I would, they're just the best.
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.920]  Anyway, they've also got a loyalty program.
[40:22.920 --> 40:24.040]  It is so easy.
[40:24.040 --> 40:27.000]  All you have to do is buy stuff, and it just puts you
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.480]  into the loyalty program.
[40:29.480 --> 40:32.520]  Once you get to level one, you get free shipping for life.
[40:32.520 --> 40:37.000]  And when you reach level two, which all you have to do
[40:37.000 --> 40:38.140]  is spend 200 bucks.
[40:38.140 --> 40:41.160]  If you buy $200 worth of stuff, you just automatically
[40:41.160 --> 40:42.220]  get into level two.
[40:42.220 --> 40:45.400]  And then from that point, you get 20% off every order
[40:45.400 --> 40:47.480]  for the next year, it's a great deal.
[40:47.480 --> 40:48.880]  You don't have to do anything to qualify.
[40:48.880 --> 40:50.560]  All you have to do is just buy stuff.
[40:50.560 --> 40:53.200]  And then the more you buy, the cheaper the stuff gets.
[40:54.480 --> 40:55.640]  They've got a great guarantee.
[40:55.640 --> 40:57.600]  If you don't like your first pair of underwear,
[40:57.600 --> 40:58.520]  you can just keep them.
[40:58.520 --> 41:00.160]  Don't send them back.
[41:00.160 --> 41:03.640]  Do not send back your dissatisfying underwear.
[41:03.640 --> 41:06.060]  But they will refund you, no questions asked.
[41:07.240 --> 41:08.880]  So here's what you can do.
[41:08.880 --> 41:11.440]  Get 20% off your first order by going to

[41:16.080 --> 41:21.080]  talk show, that's Mack, M-A-C-K, Weldon, W-L-E-L-D-O-N.com.
[41:23.520 --> 41:27.200]  Mackweldon.com slash talk show with promo code talk show
[41:27.200 --> 41:29.240]  and you can get 20% off.
[41:30.840 --> 41:32.400]  All right, we gotta talk about this case
[41:32.400 --> 41:35.000]  before we get off the AirPods, Max.
[41:35.000 --> 41:35.840]  The case.
[41:35.840 --> 41:40.840]  I know people were dunking on it immediately,
[41:42.560 --> 41:44.560]  but it wasn't until I saw it in person
[41:44.560 --> 41:47.920]  that I realized how much, and I don't know,
[41:47.920 --> 41:50.480]  I don't know, it's like, my joke is that it's like,
[41:50.480 --> 41:53.120]  I don't know which half of the bikini emoji it looks like.
[41:53.120 --> 41:56.080]  Does it look like a butt from behind?
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.960]  Or does it look like a bikini top from the front?
[41:59.960 --> 42:03.320]  It's a funny looking thing.
[42:03.320 --> 42:08.200]  It's obviously that they designed the headphones.
[42:08.200 --> 42:10.080]  Here's my guess as to how this happened.
[42:10.080 --> 42:12.600]  They designed the headphones, they made the headphones
[42:12.600 --> 42:15.080]  they wanted to make, and then they were like,
[42:15.080 --> 42:16.600]  well, how do we put these in a case?
[42:16.600 --> 42:18.760]  And then they designed a case around the headphones.
[42:18.760 --> 42:21.120]  And if the case turned out looking a little funny,
[42:21.120 --> 42:23.300]  well, that's just it.
[42:23.300 --> 42:26.000]  They're not gonna make the headphones different
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.160]  just to make the case look better, I guess.
[42:28.160 --> 42:33.160]  I did not draw the comparison to the Duo dock,
[42:36.840 --> 42:38.880]  the MagSafe Duo dock.
[42:38.880 --> 42:41.440]  You did in your review, and it's like,
[42:41.440 --> 42:44.600]  that part of your review, it was like, boom, light bulb,
[42:44.600 --> 42:47.140]  yes, that's the problem.
[42:47.140 --> 42:51.140]  The MagSafe Duo charging dock feels like
[42:53.000 --> 42:57.800]  a cheap jack piece of, if it cost 50 bucks,
[42:57.800 --> 42:59.480]  it would be like, yeah, fine, I'll buy one.
[42:59.480 --> 43:02.540]  50 bucks, that's a cool thing to take in my travel case.
[43:02.540 --> 43:07.540]  For $140 or $130 without the $20 charger it requires,
[43:08.480 --> 43:13.320]  it just doesn't feel commensurate with the price.
[43:13.320 --> 43:14.960]  It feels like a $50 charger.
[43:14.960 --> 43:18.280]  I mean, even that thing has the redeeming quality
[43:18.280 --> 43:20.880]  of having a couple of pieces of nice aluminum in it.
[43:20.880 --> 43:25.880]  The mounts for the watch and the magnet ring for the phone,
[43:28.200 --> 43:30.400]  at least those scream like, hey,
[43:30.400 --> 43:33.000]  there's some Apple stuff in here, you know?
[43:33.000 --> 43:36.400]  Whereas this is, I don't know what this is.
[43:36.400 --> 43:38.240]  You know what it reminds me of, John?
[43:40.500 --> 43:45.500]  It reminds me of when you don't have a paper towel
[43:45.960 --> 43:49.760]  and you wrap your sandwich in a napkin.
[43:49.760 --> 43:53.640]  Where you know a paper towel is more durable.
[43:53.640 --> 43:55.300]  It's got some heft to it.
[43:55.300 --> 43:56.760]  Like, okay, I mean, I'm not saying
[43:56.760 --> 43:58.560]  that everybody wraps your sandwich in a paper towel,
[43:58.560 --> 43:59.560]  but let's say you're gonna pick it up
[43:59.560 --> 44:00.820]  and you're gonna eat it and it's a little sloppy,
[44:00.820 --> 44:02.360]  it's got some juice on it, you know?
[44:02.360 --> 44:03.640]  And you're like, you know, I wanna wrap something
[44:03.640 --> 44:04.720]  around the bottom of this.
[44:04.720 --> 44:05.960]  Like you made it at home, right?
[44:05.960 --> 44:07.320]  Just like you wrap a Subway wrapper
[44:07.320 --> 44:08.900]  around the bottom of the sandwich and eat the top,
[44:08.900 --> 44:11.460]  if you're walking and talking, right?
[44:11.460 --> 44:14.040]  When you wrap a paper towel around it,
[44:14.040 --> 44:15.600]  you're like, yo, this paper towel's gonna last.
[44:15.600 --> 44:18.160]  It's gonna absorb, it's gonna soak some stuff up,
[44:18.160 --> 44:20.000]  it's gonna, you know, it's gonna be chill.
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.520]  You wrap a napkin around it, you got holes in that thing,
[44:22.520 --> 44:24.680]  you got fibers coming off, you got,
[44:24.680 --> 44:25.660]  that's what this looks like.
[44:25.660 --> 44:27.160]  It looks like you took the headphones
[44:27.160 --> 44:29.780]  and wrapped them in a napkin and it got holes in it.
[44:29.780 --> 44:31.360]  It's like, oh hey, I just need to wrap this
[44:31.360 --> 44:33.280]  in something real quick and just take it down the block
[44:33.280 --> 44:34.780]  and give my neighbor some chocolate chip cookies
[44:34.780 --> 44:37.120]  I just made, I'm gonna wrap it in this napkin, right?
[44:37.120 --> 44:38.100]  And then by the time you get there,
[44:38.100 --> 44:39.920]  the napkin's barely holding on, right?
[44:39.920 --> 44:41.880]  That's what this looks like, it's like why?
[44:41.880 --> 44:45.240]  Why go through all the effort to produce
[44:45.240 --> 44:50.200]  what is probably one of the more over-engineered,
[44:50.200 --> 44:54.480]  like precision-machined pieces of headphone gear
[44:54.480 --> 44:57.800]  I've ever seen and then wrap it in this?
[44:57.800 --> 45:02.800]  It's like, it's honestly insulting to the product itself.
[45:03.420 --> 45:05.800]  I don't get it, it's really awkward.
[45:05.800 --> 45:10.800]  And I think a couple of the other reviewers
[45:10.860 --> 45:12.180]  have mentioned this, I haven't caught up
[45:12.180 --> 45:15.640]  on all the YouTube reviews, but when I unboxed it,
[45:15.640 --> 45:17.680]  my son was here and he was keenly interested.
[45:17.680 --> 45:20.560]  My son is probably more of a headphone fan than I am.
[45:20.560 --> 45:23.480]  He in, you know, because he's on.
[45:23.480 --> 45:24.520]  What kid is it, John?
[45:24.520 --> 45:26.560]  We all loved headphones because they shut our parents up.
[45:26.560 --> 45:28.160]  I know.
[45:28.160 --> 45:31.760]  Well, but now in addition to shutting up his parents,
[45:31.760 --> 45:33.920]  it also connects them with his friends, right?
[45:33.920 --> 45:37.560]  So it's, from my era, it's a combination
[45:37.560 --> 45:40.320]  headphones and telephone.
[45:40.320 --> 45:41.640]  And telephone, exactly.
[45:41.640 --> 45:43.440]  Because I've got Discord and he's talking
[45:43.440 --> 45:44.280]  to his friends and all that.
[45:44.280 --> 45:47.920]  Right, so he's, you know, of all the stuff
[45:47.920 --> 45:50.480]  that's come in, he was more keenly interested
[45:50.480 --> 45:53.960]  in these than anything recently, I think.
[45:53.960 --> 45:56.480]  Although the M1 Mac definitely interested him.
[46:00.860 --> 46:02.920]  But he couldn't believe that the case
[46:02.920 --> 46:04.320]  wasn't part of the packaging.
[46:04.320 --> 46:09.320]  And it's weird because there is packaging around the case.
[46:09.320 --> 46:14.200]  There is like a typical white, not onion paper,
[46:14.200 --> 46:17.840]  but like Apple's version of onion paper around it.
[46:17.840 --> 46:19.960]  But you take that off and it feels like
[46:19.960 --> 46:22.240]  there's just this second level of wrapping
[46:22.240 --> 46:23.240]  around the headphones.
[46:23.240 --> 46:24.720]  And it's like, no, no, that's the case.
[46:24.720 --> 46:28.420]  And they have like a soft touch material inside.
[46:28.420 --> 46:30.200]  I'm sure it's not suede.
[46:30.200 --> 46:32.520]  There's no way they're gonna ship leather,
[46:32.520 --> 46:34.880]  you know, actual leather to everybody.
[46:35.880 --> 46:38.160]  Both cost wise and the fact that some people
[46:38.160 --> 46:40.080]  don't wanna buy leather stuff.
[46:40.080 --> 46:40.920]  Right.
[46:40.920 --> 46:44.240]  It's some kind of artificial suede soft touch thing.
[46:44.240 --> 46:45.880]  And it's not bad to the touch.
[46:45.880 --> 46:49.520]  But that outer material is either identical to
[46:49.520 --> 46:52.100]  or might as well be the kissing cousin
[46:52.100 --> 46:54.960]  of that rubbery stuff that they make
[46:56.340 --> 47:00.880]  like iPad covers out of and the Duo charging dock
[47:00.880 --> 47:03.600]  in particular is like, yeah, that's the same stuff.
[47:03.600 --> 47:06.700]  And it's not a bad material, but it is not
[47:06.700 --> 47:08.080]  a premium material.
[47:08.080 --> 47:10.520]  And there is no doubt in my mind,
[47:10.520 --> 47:12.480]  even if you're a, you know,
[47:12.480 --> 47:16.880]  like I'm thinking about where, how I travel,
[47:16.880 --> 47:18.600]  you know, when I'd go on an airplane.
[47:18.600 --> 47:22.400]  And it's not like I fill up my backpack
[47:22.400 --> 47:24.800]  or briefcase or whatever bag I'm taking with me.
[47:24.800 --> 47:26.200]  I've switched to a briefcase,
[47:26.200 --> 47:29.360]  but right before the pandemic hit.
[47:29.360 --> 47:32.520]  So like why did I spend all this money
[47:32.520 --> 47:35.000]  on a leather briefcase and I don't go anywhere.
[47:35.000 --> 47:38.520]  It's like, you know, I'm not putting
[47:39.720 --> 47:42.160]  unwrapped candy bars in there.
[47:42.160 --> 47:45.280]  You know, I don't have potted plants in there.
[47:45.280 --> 47:47.900]  It's like, you know, it's computer stuff
[47:47.900 --> 47:49.800]  and books and magazines.
[47:49.800 --> 47:51.840]  So it's all clean stuff.
[47:51.840 --> 47:56.460]  But yet somehow my hard case for my bows
[47:56.460 --> 47:58.760]  is kind of beat up, right?
[47:58.760 --> 48:01.920]  It just, you know, it's just the nature of travel, right?
[48:01.920 --> 48:04.040]  You can be as neat as you want
[48:04.040 --> 48:06.680]  and put clean stuff in a bag,
[48:06.680 --> 48:08.000]  but you're, you know, you're stuffing it
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.440]  into overhead bins, you're stuffing it under the seat.
[48:10.440 --> 48:14.280]  It, you know, it, it, even when you, even when.
[48:14.280 --> 48:17.200]  It just picks up battle scars over time.
[48:17.200 --> 48:18.740]  And I'm a careful person.
[48:18.740 --> 48:22.120]  Like other people may not be so careful, you know?
[48:22.120 --> 48:23.600]  You say, yeah, it picks up scars.
[48:23.600 --> 48:26.800]  This stuff, especially the non-space gray colors,
[48:26.800 --> 48:29.560]  there's just no way it's gonna stay clean looking.
[48:29.560 --> 48:33.220]  There's, space gray maybe will take a beating
[48:33.220 --> 48:35.720]  and maybe will look better with the beating.
[48:35.720 --> 48:39.240]  But like the blue and the green and the silver,
[48:39.240 --> 48:42.460]  it's like, it's, it just does not seem meant for that.
[48:42.460 --> 48:43.300]  I don't know.
[48:43.300 --> 48:45.160]  It's like there's a certain part of Apple
[48:45.160 --> 48:48.960]  that just, as practical as they mostly are,
[48:48.960 --> 48:51.440]  and I think the headphones themselves
[48:51.440 --> 48:54.560]  are very practically designed for the real world.
[48:54.560 --> 48:56.600]  The case, it just is not.
[48:56.600 --> 48:59.000]  And it's not a case, it's a pouch.
[48:59.000 --> 48:59.840]  Right?
[48:59.840 --> 49:03.280]  Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah, exactly, and,
[49:03.280 --> 49:06.680]  and it's $550.
[49:06.680 --> 49:08.520]  It is, it's just insane.
[49:08.520 --> 49:10.360]  And you know, there's no justifying it.
[49:10.360 --> 49:12.360]  I'm not, I'm not gonna dance around trying to go like,
[49:12.360 --> 49:15.160]  oh, well, maybe they, this is, this is clearly,
[49:15.160 --> 49:17.980]  clearly one of those things where at the last minute,
[49:17.980 --> 49:20.040]  they're like, shit, did anybody just,
[49:21.880 --> 49:23.920]  did anybody think about a case?
[49:23.920 --> 49:27.080]  Because like, I don't know, like the product shots
[49:27.080 --> 49:29.480]  show people holding it by the handle and all of this stuff.
[49:29.480 --> 49:30.320]  Like a purse, right?
[49:30.320 --> 49:32.200]  I don't know, yeah, like a purse.
[49:32.200 --> 49:33.960]  I think that it would have been better
[49:33.960 --> 49:35.640]  for them to ship it without a case,
[49:35.640 --> 49:37.100]  because you know what that tells people?
[49:37.100 --> 49:39.920]  This is for the home, and if you're gonna travel with it,
[49:39.920 --> 49:41.160]  we'll come up with something for you,
[49:41.160 --> 49:43.240]  or you can fit it into your life, right?
[49:43.240 --> 49:44.560]  Put it in a pouch, put it in a bag,
[49:44.560 --> 49:46.000]  put it in whatever, right?
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.920]  Like, you know, put it in, even a drawstring bag,
[49:48.920 --> 49:51.480]  a lot of premium headphones,
[49:51.480 --> 49:53.160]  like a lot of studio monitor headphones
[49:53.160 --> 49:55.040]  come with a drawstring bag, right?
[49:55.040 --> 49:56.400]  Some of them come with something fancier,
[49:56.400 --> 49:58.940]  but a lot of them come with like a,
[49:58.940 --> 50:03.000]  you know, a nice kind of pouch, drawstring bag type thing
[50:03.000 --> 50:06.280]  that either you use because you are that kind of person,
[50:06.280 --> 50:09.480]  or you put in the box and never ever take out, right?
[50:09.480 --> 50:11.200]  They would have been better off
[50:11.200 --> 50:15.120]  to go with that kind of situation than something half-assed,
[50:15.120 --> 50:18.240]  because I do believe it lowers the,
[50:18.240 --> 50:20.320]  it lowers the whole product, right?
[50:20.320 --> 50:23.040]  It doesn't elevate the product, it lowers the product.
[50:23.040 --> 50:27.540]  Everything about the packaging and execution of this thing,
[50:27.540 --> 50:30.800]  screams expensive, high-quality headphones.
[50:30.800 --> 50:33.840]  The box has that lovely emboss,
[50:33.840 --> 50:36.880]  the headband has this mesh
[50:36.880 --> 50:38.400]  that nobody else would think to execute
[50:38.400 --> 50:41.440]  because it's like, who would think to do that, right?
[50:41.440 --> 50:45.400]  That you can't, you know, that's hard to do materials-wise,
[50:45.400 --> 50:47.060]  to attach it with very little glue
[50:47.060 --> 50:48.960]  and very little attachment, you know,
[50:48.960 --> 50:51.080]  to bond it in the way that they did.
[50:51.080 --> 50:54.720]  The pistons on the headphones that extend them,
[50:54.720 --> 50:56.720]  it's not some cheap like rail system,
[50:56.720 --> 50:59.920]  it's like a car piston that slides out.
[50:59.920 --> 51:01.840]  All of this stuff screams like,
[51:01.840 --> 51:04.980]  we worked on this a long time and it was hard,
[51:04.980 --> 51:08.640]  and here it is, and then the case screams like,
[51:08.640 --> 51:10.680]  you know, here's this shit too.
[51:10.680 --> 51:15.680]  Right, the piston feels like you could use the piston
[51:15.780 --> 51:19.680]  for extending, you know, the cups out further out
[51:19.680 --> 51:22.200]  to accommodate a larger, smaller head,
[51:22.200 --> 51:25.400]  pull them out, push them back in for a fit.
[51:25.400 --> 51:28.800]  The pistons alone feel like you could teach
[51:28.800 --> 51:32.240]  half a semester of industrial design at a university
[51:32.240 --> 51:34.620]  by studying the piston design alone.
[51:34.620 --> 51:37.400]  It's that interesting, materials,
[51:37.400 --> 51:41.400]  and it's like, how does this, it feels magical, right?
[51:41.400 --> 51:44.300]  Because it doesn't click, it doesn't have steps,
[51:44.300 --> 51:47.000]  but it does, it holds its shape.
[51:47.000 --> 51:48.480]  I mean, will it over time?
[51:48.480 --> 51:49.960]  Again, who knows, you know, three,
[51:49.960 --> 51:53.680]  come back to me in three years and see if it still is tight,
[51:53.680 --> 51:56.640]  but yeah, super premium.
[51:56.640 --> 51:59.180]  Just the pistons alone, very, very premium,
[51:59.180 --> 52:02.240]  in a way that just blows away the bows that I have,
[52:02.240 --> 52:03.960]  which are fine, right?
[52:03.960 --> 52:07.600]  They click, you know, and they feel way sturdier
[52:07.600 --> 52:09.960]  than the bows' quiet comforts of old,
[52:09.960 --> 52:12.080]  which used to snap after 18 months,
[52:12.080 --> 52:15.760]  like guaranteed to snap 18 months after you fry them.
[52:15.760 --> 52:17.320]  Right.
[52:17.320 --> 52:21.360]  You know, it's like, but it, the case, Jesus.
[52:21.360 --> 52:24.200]  I don't know what they're thinking.
[52:25.880 --> 52:26.720]  Me neither.
[52:26.720 --> 52:27.560]  It's almost not.
[52:27.560 --> 52:30.120]  And then the worst part is you kind of need it
[52:30.120 --> 52:32.080]  to put them into hibernate, right?
[52:32.080 --> 52:33.860]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[52:33.860 --> 52:37.920]  Like if you would have had a nice, a nice shell case
[52:37.920 --> 52:42.680]  that said, hey, this is a little bulky on the case side,
[52:42.680 --> 52:45.360]  but it's your, it's the nest
[52:45.360 --> 52:47.600]  that your headphones live in, right?
[52:47.600 --> 52:50.600]  They go in there to hibernate and you keep them safe
[52:50.600 --> 52:51.920]  and they're protected.
[52:51.920 --> 52:55.800]  Like, imagine like the bows' QCs have that hard shell,
[52:55.800 --> 52:58.240]  you know, deal that zips up.
[52:58.240 --> 53:01.080]  Or I think it's like a soft, soft hard shell now,
[53:01.080 --> 53:03.080]  you know, it's like a combination floppy thing.
[53:03.080 --> 53:05.440]  But something like that in a,
[53:05.440 --> 53:08.100]  even in the same exterior material,
[53:08.100 --> 53:09.280]  I could see the complaint being,
[53:09.280 --> 53:11.280]  oh man, this is gonna get dirty, but hey, you know,
[53:11.280 --> 53:15.840]  it's a safe home for my $500, $550 headphones.
[53:15.840 --> 53:17.240]  I get it, right?
[53:17.240 --> 53:18.480]  That makes sense.
[53:18.480 --> 53:20.040]  This doesn't make any sense.
[53:20.040 --> 53:22.600]  Because it leaves the most delicate part
[53:22.600 --> 53:24.760]  of what you would think to be the headphone exposed.
[53:24.760 --> 53:26.580]  Like the material, sure,
[53:26.580 --> 53:29.580]  if you don't want these aluminum things to scratch,
[53:29.580 --> 53:30.580]  I get it.
[53:30.580 --> 53:32.680]  But at the same time, who cares?
[53:32.680 --> 53:34.360]  Who gives a crap, right?
[53:34.360 --> 53:37.200]  The headband though, it's a mesh.
[53:37.200 --> 53:39.000]  Like we're gonna stick it in there with my pens
[53:39.000 --> 53:40.880]  and pocket knives and I forget to close it all the way
[53:40.880 --> 53:43.480]  or whatever, like, protect that, you know?
[53:43.480 --> 53:46.080]  I mean, it's weird, it's weird, it's just all weird.
[53:46.080 --> 53:48.240]  Right, like you could get a scratch on the ear cups
[53:48.240 --> 53:49.080]  and it's a scratch.
[53:49.080 --> 53:50.920]  It's like getting a scratch on the back of your phone.
[53:50.920 --> 53:51.760]  Who cares?
[53:51.760 --> 53:53.020]  I mean, you know, people might care,
[53:53.020 --> 53:57.080]  but I don't wanna get a hole poked in the mesh, you know?
[53:57.080 --> 53:58.800]  Right, right.
[54:00.800 --> 54:02.960]  Anyway, I'm still not quite sure what to make of it.
[54:02.960 --> 54:06.160]  I'm glad, I know the, you know, I guess we,
[54:06.160 --> 54:08.480]  you know, 550 bucks, it is premium.
[54:08.480 --> 54:10.720]  And it's a bad year to come out
[54:10.720 --> 54:13.320]  with premium $550 headphones.
[54:13.320 --> 54:16.300]  I mean, times are tough, the world is a mess.
[54:16.300 --> 54:21.300]  But, you know, there is this whole world of high-end audio
[54:22.700 --> 54:27.700]  and $550 isn't even the highest of the high by far.
[54:30.780 --> 54:32.980]  I'm glad Apple is making,
[54:32.980 --> 54:35.580]  shooting for super premium headphones.
[54:35.580 --> 54:40.100]  And same way with HomePod, right?
[54:40.100 --> 54:42.740]  And it's like, I know, you know, people are,
[54:42.740 --> 54:44.020]  a lot of people think, you know,
[54:44.020 --> 54:46.700]  the reason Apple is behind in market share
[54:46.700 --> 54:50.460]  on home talk to your dingus devices
[54:50.460 --> 54:52.980]  is that HomePod was their only standalone device
[54:52.980 --> 54:54.380]  until they came out with the mini
[54:54.380 --> 54:56.060]  and it started at 300 bucks.
[54:56.060 --> 54:57.980]  Or maybe it was 350 when it first came out.
[54:57.980 --> 55:00.540]  And that's a lot more than all these $50 pucks
[55:00.540 --> 55:02.020]  that everybody else makes.
[55:02.020 --> 55:05.860]  But I'm glad they make HomePod that sounds so amazing.
[55:05.860 --> 55:07.040]  I really am.
[55:08.800 --> 55:12.380]  But it's, you know, there seems to be
[55:12.380 --> 55:17.260]  a bit of a gap in price between AirPods Pro and AirPods Max
[55:17.260 --> 55:20.940]  where there could be another set of headphones in between.
[55:20.940 --> 55:23.280]  In between, yeah, it's a pretty big,
[55:23.280 --> 55:26.300]  I mean, they shot for the outside edge
[55:26.300 --> 55:28.460]  before the middle edge, right?
[55:28.460 --> 55:30.460]  Now, it is gap filling, right?
[55:30.460 --> 55:33.120]  You have people who are obviously buying
[55:33.120 --> 55:35.420]  and Apple can see, obviously, very well
[55:35.420 --> 55:37.020]  that people buy Beats, right?
[55:37.020 --> 55:38.980]  And they know how many people buy them
[55:38.980 --> 55:41.460]  and they know that that price is, you know,
[55:41.460 --> 55:43.460]  in the middle of the $300 bracket.
[55:43.460 --> 55:46.260]  And, you know, they're still benefiting from that
[55:46.260 --> 55:49.040]  in that they own Beats and all of that.
[55:49.040 --> 55:52.380]  But that also proves out the need and the desire
[55:52.380 --> 55:55.860]  for people to have something in that universe
[55:55.860 --> 55:58.020]  that supports the most advanced features
[55:58.020 --> 56:01.460]  that Apple has shipped in any audio devices so far, right?
[56:01.460 --> 56:05.300]  Which, to me, is really the point of these headphones.
[56:05.300 --> 56:08.340]  It's not, you know, at the beginning of this conversation,
[56:08.340 --> 56:09.820]  I was like, hey, I'm not really interested
[56:09.820 --> 56:12.180]  in comparing these to non-NC headphones
[56:12.180 --> 56:14.500]  because by nature, any time you introduce processing
[56:14.500 --> 56:19.500]  into the audio path, it's no longer a pristine audio device,
[56:20.100 --> 56:23.220]  right, it's just, that's not about that transmitting
[56:23.220 --> 56:27.620]  the pure fidelity of the original recording
[56:27.620 --> 56:30.260]  directly to your ears with as little, you know,
[56:30.260 --> 56:31.620]  fuss as possible.
[56:31.620 --> 56:35.980]  There are absolutely headphones and applications for that.
[56:35.980 --> 56:39.860]  I get it, you know, recording audio files listening
[56:39.860 --> 56:42.300]  to the original vinyl and, you know,
[56:42.300 --> 56:45.620]  if you got a $1,500 vinyl record player,
[56:45.620 --> 56:47.660]  you're, you know, this is nothing.
[56:47.660 --> 56:49.980]  You know, you want headphones that transmit that,
[56:49.980 --> 56:53.000]  you know, or $2,000 record player or more, whatever.
[56:53.000 --> 56:54.020]  You get the drift.
[56:54.020 --> 56:56.780]  But this, that's not that at all.
[56:56.780 --> 56:59.940]  So then you have to ask yourself, like, what is this about?
[56:59.940 --> 57:04.340]  Like, what's the purpose of shipping these?
[57:04.340 --> 57:09.340]  And the two H1 chips, nine microphones,
[57:09.800 --> 57:13.780]  like every trick that they've learned so far in audio
[57:13.780 --> 57:15.060]  is in these things.
[57:15.060 --> 57:17.740]  And it's tied to, of course, all of the tricks
[57:17.740 --> 57:21.740]  that they've introduced on iOS for, you know,
[57:21.740 --> 57:24.060]  positional audio, the spatial audio
[57:24.060 --> 57:25.400]  that they're shipping, right?
[57:25.400 --> 57:28.060]  You have the adaptive EQ, which says, hey,
[57:28.060 --> 57:29.420]  I'm gonna read the seal of your ears.
[57:29.420 --> 57:30.900]  Some other headphones do this,
[57:30.900 --> 57:33.340]  but not to the efficacy of these.
[57:33.340 --> 57:36.140]  It's better than any of the others I've tried.
[57:36.140 --> 57:41.100]  I will say that there is a case to be made here
[57:41.100 --> 57:43.400]  that what they're doing is exactly what you were alluding
[57:43.400 --> 57:46.820]  to on the AR front, that they are building out
[57:46.820 --> 57:48.500]  this sort of platform.
[57:48.500 --> 57:52.580]  And in my original first, you know,
[57:52.580 --> 57:54.660]  gasp review of the AirPods,
[57:54.660 --> 57:56.540]  because they came out at the same time as an iPhone.
[57:56.540 --> 57:58.880]  And I like tucked my AirPods review into that,
[57:58.880 --> 58:00.900]  but I also broke it out because I felt like, you know,
[58:00.900 --> 58:03.140]  it's worth talking about on its own.
[58:03.140 --> 58:03.980]  A little bit.
[58:03.980 --> 58:06.080]  And it was like, hey, this is audio AR, you know,
[58:06.080 --> 58:08.220]  get ready, you know, we're gonna be looking at this.
[58:08.220 --> 58:11.080]  And I was, you know, I can't remember when they came out.
[58:11.080 --> 58:14.100]  Now the ears blend together several years ago, right?
[58:14.100 --> 58:16.620]  But that was basically, you know,
[58:16.620 --> 58:19.540]  me trying to be all fun and future looking and say,
[58:19.540 --> 58:20.940]  hey, what if, what if, what if, what if?
[58:20.940 --> 58:22.540]  Well, we're in what if now.
[58:22.540 --> 58:24.860]  You know, it's creating, when you put these on,
[58:24.860 --> 58:28.700]  the larger drivers, the ear cup, the comfort,
[58:28.700 --> 58:31.920]  and now the content that supports that most
[58:31.920 --> 58:35.180]  and all of this stuff, it crafts a soundstage for you
[58:35.180 --> 58:36.620]  that feels real.
[58:36.620 --> 58:38.620]  It feels like you're listening to the audio
[58:38.620 --> 58:40.340]  without headphones on.
[58:40.340 --> 58:41.780]  If you're looking at this, you know,
[58:41.780 --> 58:43.580]  if you're watching the kind of content that supports it,
[58:43.580 --> 58:47.040]  right, it's not all content and it's only on iOS devices.
[58:47.040 --> 58:49.760]  There's a lot of limitations here so far, right?
[58:49.760 --> 58:52.660]  But if you are looking, you're watching an episode
[58:52.660 --> 58:57.660]  of a show on the iOS device that supports that most
[58:57.820 --> 59:01.420]  and the spatial audio is on and you turn it off,
[59:01.420 --> 59:04.900]  the soundstage like vanishes and you're getting
[59:04.900 --> 59:08.140]  a single flat kind of, hey, here's all your presentation,
[59:08.140 --> 59:10.260]  sounds good, but whatever.
[59:10.260 --> 59:13.080]  When you turn it on, it really is insane.
[59:13.080 --> 59:16.460]  Like it's really incredible the breadth and depth
[59:16.460 --> 59:17.980]  of the soundstage there.
[59:17.980 --> 59:20.560]  I mean, I've spent, I spent years, like 10 years
[59:20.560 --> 59:22.420]  installing home theater audio.
[59:22.420 --> 59:24.880]  And I know what a good soundstage sounds like.
[59:24.880 --> 59:27.100]  I'm not the world's expert on this stuff,
[59:27.100 --> 59:29.500]  but I know how to set up a home theater system.
[59:29.500 --> 59:32.540]  I know how to set up 7.1 and 5.1.
[59:32.540 --> 59:36.340]  It's actually really good.
[59:36.340 --> 59:39.240]  Definitely not to the par of some sort of actual
[59:39.240 --> 59:42.300]  physical installation, never probably will be,
[59:42.300 --> 59:46.580]  but maybe, you know, it's actually really getting close.
[59:46.580 --> 59:49.100]  It's way, way better than any of those
[59:49.100 --> 59:51.640]  like fake sound bar-y type things where they're like,
[59:51.640 --> 59:53.300]  hey, we'll project your audio for you.
[59:53.300 --> 59:55.420]  And they just kind of like use a little beam forming.
[59:55.420 --> 59:56.580]  It's way better than that.
[59:56.580 --> 59:58.020]  It's pretty incredible.
[59:58.020 --> 59:59.900]  And so I think that it's really a test bed
[59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.220]  for all of those technologies.
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:06.220]  It is the best you can get right now in a headphone version
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:10.100]  of a home theater audio setup.
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:13.060]  But the downsides, of course, we're all still there.
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:14.140]  It only works on iOS.
[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:16.940]  It's only on portable devices like an iPad or whatever.
[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:19.340]  You can't watch your Apple TV and get that spatial audio.
[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:21.260]  It doesn't work yet, you know, that kind of thing.
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:22.340]  It seems crazy to me.
[01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:25.220]  I blew a chunk of my review complaining about it.
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:27.520]  It seems crazy that it doesn't work with Apple TV.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:32.520]  I mean, like, it is quite possibly a better audio experience
[01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:38.380]  than you could get from any speakers, right?
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:41.060]  Because it's right there personally for you.
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:46.060]  Like in the way that VR goggles are gonna give you
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:51.260]  a better VR experience than a screen ever could, right?
[01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:52.500]  Right.
[01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:55.780]  It's like, you know, like the old Star Trek holodeck.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:58.620]  Never really added up the way, like, wait,
[01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:01.020]  if it's just a bunch of, if it's just four walls
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:04.380]  in like a racquetball court, how do they protecting stuff
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:06.720]  in the middle, but whatever is the future.
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:12.620]  Like in the way that for true VR you really need goggles
[01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:14.660]  that are personal for you, and if you and I
[01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:17.340]  are having the same experience, we both need goggles
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.580]  so that we're both getting a personal experience.
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:23.100]  I think that it's quite possible that for that spatial audio
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:25.580]  you're getting a better experience from these headphones
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:28.220]  than you would from any speaker set up in a room,
[01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:29.060]  because it's for you.
[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.980]  And maybe you could set the speakers up
[01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:33.140]  so there's one sweet spot in the middle
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:36.100]  where like two people sitting in the middle of the room
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:39.860]  get the perfect experience, but everybody else aren't,
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:41.620]  because they're not in the center.
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:47.340]  You get the best possible audio experience
[01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:49.660]  to watch a blockbuster action movie,
[01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:53.100]  and you have to watch it on an iPad to get,
[01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:56.980]  that's the biggest screen you can get, it's insane.
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:58.260]  It just seems crazy to me.
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:00.100]  Anyway, I'll pick this up because I want to keep going,
[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:01.820]  but let me take a break while I'm thinking about it
[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:03.460]  and thank our next sponsor.
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:04.660]  Oh, I love this company.
[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:06.500]  They're sponsoring Daring Fireball this week.
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:10.980]  It's the rare two-shot where their sponsorship coincides
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:13.580]  with the website and the podcast,
[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:16.020]  because I'm not good at juggling things.
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:18.660]  Kolide, or Kolide, actually I learned
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:20.940]  that I mispronounced their name among many others,
[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:23.620]  but it looks like Kolide, K-O-L-I-D-E,
[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:25.060]  but they pronounce it Kolide.
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:26.900]  Anyway, they're an endpoint security company
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:29.380]  for teams at Slack, and they have just released
[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:32.700]  a free guide called Honest Security,
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:34.980]  and they want me to tell you about it.
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:39.180]  In the guide, Kolide, Kolide shares and expands
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:41.460]  on everything they've learned over the last year,
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.220]  working on their own product in the hope
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:45.500]  that they can inspire others to embrace and expand
[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:48.140]  on the same honest approach.
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:50.700]  The guide discusses five key tenets,
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:52.820]  the values your organization stands behind
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:55.780]  should be well represented in your security program,
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:58.300]  a positive working relationship between the end user
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:02.220]  and security team is incredibly valuable and worth fostering.
[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:05.580]  This relationship is built on a foundation of trust
[01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:09.020]  that is demonstrated through informed consent
[01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:10.780]  and transparency.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:13.420]  The security team should anticipate and expect
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:16.980]  that end users use their company-owned devices
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:19.060]  for personal activities and design
[01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:22.420]  their detection capabilities with this in mind.
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:25.260]  End users are capable of making rational
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:27.740]  and informed decisions about security risks
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:31.220]  when educated and honestly motivated.
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:34.460]  You can read this guide completely for free at,
[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:37.080]  and this is like my favorite little detail,
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.320]  the guide is called Honest Security.
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:43.780]  The guide is at the domain name honest.security.
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:47.340]  That's swear to God, that's the URL, honest.security
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:50.100]  for their honest security report.
[01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:52.660]  No forms, collect your email and there's nothing else
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:53.500]  to slow you down.
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:54.940]  It's not like, oh, give us your email
[01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:56.140]  and then you can read it.
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:04:01.120]  Just go to honest.security and read the guide for free.
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.320]  That's all they want me to tell you.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:06.640]  So my thanks to Collide, AKA Collide,
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.340]  for sponsoring the show.
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:10.500]  Go to honest.security and read their guide.
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:16.180]  So here's where I'm going with this, with the spatial audio.
[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:18.520]  To me, and this is why I love talking to you about it,
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.220]  because I think you know what I'm talking about.
[01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:24.700]  To me, it is Disney-esque in terms of its immersiveness.
[01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:31.680]  It is visceral when you're watching something
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:33.660]  that is hooked up with this.
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:34.660]  It is crazy.
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:39.660]  So Apple sent the reviewer's guide some suggested scenes
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:44.300]  of movies that really show off spatial audio
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:48.060]  and it was sort of like their, look, in normal times,
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:49.540]  I probably would have gone to New York
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:51.580]  and I guess they maybe would have had you
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:53.060]  go down to Cupertino or something,
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:57.020]  but they probably would have had a product briefing
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:02.020]  in New York and had one set up for the press to go over.
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:05.020]  And now, here, try this and we'll show you.
[01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:06.780]  Although I guess they probably just would have had
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:08.620]  an iPad set up in front of everybody
[01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:11.260]  because it doesn't work with Apple TV.
[01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:13.980]  But here are some of the scenes they might have shown us.
[01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:16.200]  And I looked at them, because it's like,
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.240]  yeah, show me what spatial audio is awesome at.
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:23.600]  And one of them was a scene from Ford versus Ferrari,
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:26.300]  which I love, which is a great movie.
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:27.420]  Do you see that guy, what's his name?
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:29.780]  James Mangold, he's gonna direct the...
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:31.600]  Yeah, James Mangold's directing the new indie.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.440]  The new indie.
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:33.260]  I'm stoked.
[01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:34.540]  Yeah, yeah, hopefully.
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:36.540]  Yeah, I think he has the right sensibility to it.
[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:38.780]  It's like Ford versus Ferrari,
[01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:41.960]  while not the world's most amazing cinema ever,
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:44.060]  had really exciting photography,
[01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:49.060]  really deft-hand as far as the character beats.
[01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:51.520]  And in a movie like that, that has that kind of arc
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.860]  where you know where it's headed in general,
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:55.540]  and you know it's a known story,
[01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:58.820]  it had the right moments of joy and catharsis.
[01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:00.180]  I thought he did a really good job.
[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:01.220]  He'll do good with an indie, I think.
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:04.540]  I thought it was kind of crazy serendipity that this...
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:05.480]  Did the news break?
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:10.060]  I saw the news that he's gonna helm indie five yesterday.
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:11.900]  Because I know Disney had this big announcement
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:14.700]  where they announced all their stuff for the next year.
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:17.020]  If it didn't come out yesterday,
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:18.880]  it came out the day before.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.820]  But I thought it was such serendipity,
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:23.740]  because a friend of the show, Todd Vizziri,
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:29.680]  was tweeting recently just some sound design clips
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:31.860]  from Raiders of the Lost Ark, which is like,
[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:34.560]  seriously, maybe my favorite movie of all time.
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:37.620]  Always, always in the top five.
[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:40.140]  And if you say, you know, give me the best movies
[01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:43.300]  you've ever seen, Raiders is always in my top five.
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:46.460]  And the sound is one of my favorite things about Raiders.
[01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:50.080]  Always has been, and it's always been confounding to me
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:53.600]  that more action movies don't just go back to Raiders.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:58.340]  Like, one of the great things in Raiders is,
[01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:00.780]  okay, action movies, what happens in action movies
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:02.820]  that doesn't really happen in real life all the time?
[01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:05.100]  People are always firing guns, right?
[01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:07.280]  It's guns, boom, boom, boom.
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.780]  People are firing guns all the time.
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:12.700]  In real life, a gunshot is a hell of a thing, right?
[01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:13.540]  Anytime.
[01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:14.360]  It's intense.
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:15.200]  Right.
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:17.860]  Every time a gun goes off in Raiders of the Lost Ark,
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:19.500]  it is a hell of a thing.
[01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.740]  It is like, boom.
[01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:25.300]  It's one gunshot is a hell of a thing.
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:28.260]  And it sounds like it, it's like, turn that up loud.
[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:31.980]  Ford versus Ferrari has that sort of, hey,
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:35.620]  if you take a $9 million race car in 1968
[01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:37.260]  or whatever the hell year this was,
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:41.460]  and just had a guy run it at top speed around a race course,
[01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:44.400]  that's gonna be, that's a hell of a machine
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.620]  to put up into the red.
[01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:48.780]  If you put that race car in the red,
[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:49.620]  that's a hell of a thing.
[01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:50.860]  It's overwhelming, right?
[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:51.740]  It's overwhelming.
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:55.260]  And I've been in cars with, not one of those specifically,
[01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:57.440]  but I've been in cars at that level
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.060]  with somebody else driving who really knows
[01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:00.540]  how to hone it around.
[01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:02.580]  It's an overwhelming experience.
[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:06.660]  Your body is just sort of, you know, it's intense.
[01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:09.020]  And that's why F1 drivers are some of the best athletes
[01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:10.900]  in the world, because you can't imagine
[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:14.100]  the stresses that they go under.
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:17.020]  So anyway, that was just a fun serendipity,
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:19.860]  because I thought that's what makes the sound design
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:22.740]  of Ford versus Ferrari such a great example,
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:25.860]  is exactly the sort of thing that, in my opinion,
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:28.340]  the indie franchise has gotten away from,
[01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:31.940]  and it's sort of devolved into standard action fare.
[01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:34.220]  And that, man, when you go back to Raiders,
[01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:37.380]  and just like, hey, like a whip crack, just boom.
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:41.900]  Just focus on this one thing instead of trying to,
[01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:44.440]  you know, pick one crayon out of the box.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:47.900]  Don't use all 64 of them at once, right?
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:48.740]  Right.
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:52.500]  Anyway, Ford versus Ferrari, wow.
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:55.540]  It was, the scene they suggested was the scene
[01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:58.540]  where the Matt Damon character, what's it, Shelby,
[01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:03.180]  takes the Ford grandson and he like,
[01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:05.600]  not really tricks him, but like, just, hey,
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.540]  take a seat in the car, let me take you around the track.
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:09.380]  Right.
[01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:14.140]  It's both the race car sound and the tire squealing
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:17.580]  and the bits of dialogue mixed in,
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:19.060]  where there's characters talking
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:20.780]  while there's this crazy noise.
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:24.940]  And it's not just that you can hear them loud as day,
[01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:28.020]  clear as a bell, but that there's direction to it.
[01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:30.860]  And if the character is like slightly off
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:33.980]  to the right center on screen,
[01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:37.820]  their voice is coming, like, and it, again,
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:40.780]  does not sound like it's coming from the iPad,
[01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:42.820]  arms reach away from you.
[01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:46.740]  It sounds like there's a man six feet off,
[01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:49.420]  a little bit to your right, talking to you.
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:53.580]  It is, and that visceral nature of it
[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:55.460]  sounds like there's a person right there,
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:58.640]  and it sounds like you're in a tiny little race car
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:00.460]  where your knees are up by your chin
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:04.900]  with this crazy engine that could kill you,
[01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:07.280]  revving right in front of you.
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:10.540]  It all sounds so real, and it just is like the best
[01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:12.700]  of like a modern Disney attraction.
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:14.900]  Like, yeah, it feels like you're riding
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:20.620]  one of those crazy flying things in Avatar, you know?
[01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:23.940]  Yeah, it really does.
[01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:27.180]  And like the experience, I've said this,
[01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:28.340]  I just like said this on Twitter,
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:29.620]  and other people are like, oh, yeah, yeah,
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:31.180]  this happened to me too.
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:33.420]  The experience of watching one of these movies
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.580]  with the, you know, even the AirPods Pro,
[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:38.080]  but obviously even more intense with the Max,
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:41.180]  is that it feels like you don't have headphones on
[01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:43.380]  and that the sound is actually projecting out
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:46.220]  into the room itself from the device.
[01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:47.720]  And I think somebody took this to mean
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.720]  that I thought the iPad sounded great.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:50.760]  That's not what I mean.
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:54.200]  It's just, I mean, it's better than iPads in the past,
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:55.820]  if you're talking about like the iPad Pro,
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:57.100]  but it really has nothing to do with that.
[01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:59.540]  It's really that the sound feels like
[01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:01.700]  it's filling the room that you're in.
[01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:06.040]  And so like I had the experience of sitting in bed,
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:08.880]  watching a movie on the iPad,
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:11.100]  and the spatial audio turned on,
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.900]  and when I was watching it,
[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:14.820]  I actually thought I was gonna wake my wife up
[01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:17.660]  because I thought that my headphones had disconnected,
[01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:19.940]  and that it was playing through the iPad speakers
[01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:22.060]  out into the room, right?
[01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:24.740]  And I took them off multiple times.
[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:27.020]  Like I did it once, I'm like, oh no, I guess not,
[01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:28.580]  because then it pauses, and you're like,
[01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:30.500]  you know, is it playing or not?
[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:31.780]  And no, I guess not.
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:33.540]  And I put it back in, it starts playing.
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:34.620]  I'm like, oh yeah, that's definitely the head,
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:35.940]  and then a couple minutes later, I did it again.
[01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:37.180]  I didn't believe myself.
[01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:39.700]  It's actually kind of remarkable.
[01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:41.700]  And I think there's, people are getting
[01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:43.740]  a little bit hung up on the Atmos thing
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:46.100]  because they're like, oh, does this really sound
[01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:49.100]  like height level speakers plus 5.1, you know,
[01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:50.880]  which is really what makes Atmos different,
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:54.300]  and it's like, uh, no, you know, not really, right?
[01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:56.940]  Like, Atmos is Atmos for a reason,
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:59.500]  and sure, if you have physical speakers
[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:02.140]  filling a physical space, and, and,
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:03.560]  they're all calibrated correctly,
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.500]  and you have the right room for it,
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:08.060]  and, you know, the screen is the right distance away,
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:09.900]  and you're sitting in the optimal position
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:12.840]  to listen to this, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right?
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:16.260]  Not, yeah, how many people are gonna have the experience
[01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:21.220]  of Atmos in their home, very few proportionately speaking.
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:23.100]  Like, I have an Atmos system in my house
[01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:24.660]  because I'm fortunate enough to have the space
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:26.580]  that works for it, and I know how to set it up,
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:28.380]  so I did it all myself, so it didn't cost me
[01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:30.620]  a arm and a leg to install it, right?
[01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:34.380]  But most people don't, and I do believe
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:36.880]  that that is one interesting thing about this,
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:41.540]  that yes, these are $550, but the AirPods Pro are not,
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:43.300]  and they both do spatial audio,
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:45.060]  and as they build out this platform,
[01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:48.260]  I do believe it is actually, and this is why I think
[01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:50.960]  this is driven from the executive level a lot,
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:52.940]  because I believe that there are a lot of cinemaphiles
[01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:55.580]  in Apple, and a lot of people who love high-end audio
[01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:57.780]  and all of this stuff, which is why we got HomePod
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:01.240]  and not, you know, Apple Alexa,
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:05.740]  is that they're democratizing quality of sound
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:08.380]  in a pretty aggressive way, so yes,
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:11.460]  you may not get 100% of Atmos, but you may get
[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:15.140]  60 to 70% of Atmos in a headphone
[01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:17.120]  that somebody could buy for $550
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:19.660]  instead of spending eight grand on an Atmos setup.
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:23.220]  And it's definitely a different way
[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:25.900]  to frame this conversation, and I'm sure people
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:28.220]  will bitch at me about it, but as somebody
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:30.800]  who has gone through the trouble to do this
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:32.860]  and help people set these up over the years,
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:35.340]  I'm just telling you, it's actually a really impressive
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:37.900]  sound stage that they've built virtually,
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:40.560]  and it will give a lot more people exposure
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:44.560]  to the kind of home theater-type sound at home
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.460]  if they're using these devices.
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:47.900]  I just wish it worked with Apple TV
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:49.740]  the way it's supposed to, you know?
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:52.260]  And I need to do some more testing.
[01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:53.860]  It has to be coming to Apple TV.
[01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:56.940]  Whether it really does require some sort of hardware
[01:13:56.940 --> 01:14:01.180]  for locating the headphones versus where the TV is,
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:04.140]  and we really have to wait for another Apple TV
[01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:07.500]  hardware update, or if it could be done in software,
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:10.540]  I don't know, but it seems criminal to me
[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:15.540]  that Apple TV is $200, and you're gonna have to buy
[01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:19.700]  another new one to get spatial audio,
[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:21.060]  but if it does, it does.
[01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:23.100]  I mean, if it really does require hardware
[01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:25.220]  that's only currently in iPhones and iPads,
[01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:26.580]  then what are they gonna do?
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:30.660]  But it has to be coming, because it's so frickin' good.
[01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:35.380]  And there really are, it's not just if you don't wanna spend
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:37.940]  for the speakers, but if you've got a small apartment
[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:39.580]  and a sleeping baby down the hall,
[01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:42.220]  or your wife is sleeping on the couch,
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:43.980]  or if you've got a TV in the bedroom
[01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:48.980]  and you wanna watch this movie on the TV in your bedroom
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:52.420]  and your spouse is sleeping next to you,
[01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:54.140]  headphones are the way to go.
[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:56.620]  But with these, you don't have to sacrifice.
[01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:59.460]  And I'm with you, it is like you get absorbed.
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:02.780]  It's like 15, 30 seconds, a minute in,
[01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:04.980]  and it's like I'm thinking like a reviewer,
[01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:07.820]  and I'm trying to figure out how this works,
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:12.220]  and I'm thinking about how this, and where sources,
[01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:13.580]  and then all of a sudden I realize
[01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:15.220]  another two minutes have gone by,
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:18.260]  and I'm just into the movie, and it's like whoa,
[01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:20.540]  I cannot believe that this is in my headphones.
[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:24.340]  It is so immersive, it is incredibly impressive,
[01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:27.700]  and it is like multi,
[01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:30.060]  you know, multi 10 million dollar
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:33.220]  Disney attraction immersiveness that you can get.
[01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:35.220]  Again, 550 is a lot for headphones,
[01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:38.740]  but $550 for this world-class immersion,
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:40.980]  and you don't have to know any technical details.
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:43.780]  There's no EQs to turn up or down.
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:46.780]  It's just make it sound good, you know?
[01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:48.380]  It is so immersive.
[01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:50.980]  But you've got a good sound system.
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:54.780]  I set up, I finally got around to hooking up two HomePods
[01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:56.540]  to my Apple TV in my living room.
[01:15:56.540 --> 01:16:01.540]  My audio situation is that we were having renovations
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:06.140]  done last year, and we didn't know,
[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:08.940]  but it turned out being like incredible,
[01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:10.260]  it was like, you know, Indiana,
[01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:12.180]  go back to Indiana Jones, you know Indiana Jones
[01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:14.620]  slipping under the door, and then goes back
[01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:19.260]  and grabs his whip before the door closes?
[01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:22.060]  That was our contractors finishing up
[01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:24.140]  before COVID shut down.
[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:26.860]  It was just, they finished up in the first week of March,
[01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:29.700]  and it was like, huh, that worked out really well.
[01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:34.500]  So we got a new TV, because we redid the living room.
[01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:39.500]  And it's, you know, I got the big 77-inch LG OLED thing,
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:42.220]  and I didn't buy a sound system yet.
[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:45.780]  And I was like, well, we'll just play,
[01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:48.060]  let's just play audio through the TV.
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:50.980]  And it's like, hey, the audio through the TV is not bad.
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:54.540]  And neither Amy nor Jonas really complain about it.
[01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:56.060]  I'm surprised Jonas doesn't.
[01:16:56.060 --> 01:17:01.060]  But it's for TV, sound coming out of the TV, it's not bad.
[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:04.180]  And so I've just procrastinated all year long,
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:06.900]  because it's 2020, and I haven't bought anything.
[01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:09.660]  So I didn't have to unhook anything to set up.
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:12.540]  I just had to move HomePods from other rooms in the house
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:14.140]  to put them in the living room.
[01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:16.660]  It sounds really good.
[01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:21.660]  I, you know, obviously it can't fake coming from behind you,
[01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:24.780]  but I'm not really into that.
[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:27.460]  I don't really want speakers behind me.
[01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:29.500]  Like, I'm fine with having all the audio
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:30.780]  coming from before me.
[01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:35.740]  But the HomePods as home stereo thing sounds way better
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:38.540]  than they have any right to sound, in my opinion.
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:45.100]  And I love the idea, and it scores me points with the wife,
[01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:47.460]  that if I go this route,
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:51.500]  I don't have to have a separate woofer.
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.340]  I don't have to have a woofer,
[01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:56.140]  which is, you know, I score some political points on that.
[01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:57.380]  It's really impressive.
[01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:01.900]  I just love what Apple's doing in this arena.
[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:05.060]  I really do think it comes to exactly what you said,
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:08.100]  that there are people in the company who love movies,
[01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:11.420]  but really want to democratize it.
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:14.020]  And again, it is this weird,
[01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:16.340]  like, to me, that's the explanation.
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:19.420]  Like, why in the world are they selling $550 headphones?
[01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:22.660]  Why are they selling $300 smart speakers?
[01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:25.180]  Well, they're not $300 smart speakers, you know?
[01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:27.500]  And why do they work better with a pair?
[01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:29.860]  So it's a $600 setup.
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:32.300]  And it's like, if you think of them as gadgets
[01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:35.060]  competing with Alexa stuff,
[01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:37.340]  yeah, $600 is a lot.
[01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:41.220]  But if you think of it compared to what Bang & Olufsen
[01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:42.780]  wants to sell you, you know,
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:45.820]  it's really not, it is, you know,
[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:48.020]  if you come at it from the other side of the market,
[01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:51.580]  it is, these are democratizing prices.
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:52.860]  Yeah, and it's, look,
[01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:58.180]  at the bottom level of this, you go, money is real.
[01:18:58.180 --> 01:18:59.820]  $550 is a lot of money.
[01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:01.740]  So if you decide to buy these things,
[01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:03.940]  you need to be comfortable spending $550.
[01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:05.660]  If you're comfortable spending that,
[01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:07.420]  it's actually a really fascinating product
[01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:09.220]  with some distinct benefits for people
[01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:11.780]  that are tightly integrated with the iOS system,
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:13.820]  especially if you watch a lot on iPad.
[01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:15.260]  Like, that's my summary.
[01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:17.340]  You know, if you watch, if you watch a lot,
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:19.580]  if you listen to a lot of music,
[01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:22.060]  like straight up music from, you know, Apple Music
[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:25.180]  or stream from an iOS device, it'll be great there too.
[01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:27.180]  If you watch movies from iPad,
[01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:29.620]  I think you're gonna get a better experience.
[01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:34.220]  And theoretically, you're buying into a future platform
[01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:36.380]  that will work for home theater as well.
[01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:39.500]  Like in terms of like watching it on an Apple TV.
[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:41.380]  But if you just want a pair of headphones
[01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:43.180]  that work great for noise cancellation,
[01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:45.260]  fold up really well and travel really well,
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:46.340]  don't buy these.
[01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:47.340]  They're not for that.
[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:49.380]  They won't work well for that.
[01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:50.940]  As it stands, there's no case
[01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:54.380]  that I'd really recommend traveling with them with.
[01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:57.740]  You know, it's just not good for that, period.
[01:19:57.740 --> 01:20:01.380]  Yeah, and my suggestion, if you want the Apple stuff,
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:04.340]  just seriously try AirPods Pro for that.
[01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:07.740]  Because I've flown, you know, there wasn't a big window
[01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:09.940]  between AirPods Pro coming out last October
[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:12.220]  and the March shutdown, but I had a couple of flights
[01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:16.860]  in there, and I stopped carrying the Bose,
[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:18.380]  not because I'd given up on them,
[01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:20.380]  but just specifically so that, well,
[01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:23.380]  if I'm going to try AirPods Pro on the flight,
[01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:25.420]  I took at least one flight where I had them both
[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:28.500]  so I could try them both side by side in the cabin,
[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:32.100]  and it went well enough where like the next trip I took
[01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:34.380]  before everything shut down and I stopped taking trips,
[01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:35.860]  I just took AirPods Pro.
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:37.980]  They really worked pretty well for that,
[01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:40.980]  where the noise cancellation is good enough
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:43.940]  to get out the cabin noise and you're just listening
[01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:46.620]  to music or movies and it sounds clear,
[01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:47.740]  but it's not like this.
[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:50.020]  And like in my review, I touched on this,
[01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:51.780]  where it's like, I don't know what to say,
[01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:54.020]  because it's like the movies where this would make
[01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:56.780]  the biggest difference and be worthwhile
[01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:59.220]  are the sort of movies where I really wanna watch
[01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:04.220]  on my TV at home, but if I am gonna watch a movie
[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:08.700]  on a plane, why not completely satiate one of my senses?
[01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:10.580]  Like, there's nothing you can do on a plane
[01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:13.300]  to give yourself a 77-inch OLED,
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:16.820]  but you can give yourself a truly world-class
[01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:18.580]  audio experience, why not?
[01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:21.420]  Like, and I could totally see if I got into a good movie
[01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:24.500]  with these on, I feel like it would be like somebody
[01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:27.140]  like, you know, sitting in the middle seat next to me
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:28.740]  who wants to go to the bathroom and they're gonna tap me
[01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:30.860]  on the shoulder and I'm gonna be like shocked
[01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:32.460]  because I forgot I was over there.
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:33.780]  Like, I really do.
[01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:35.420]  I think that even though you're watching
[01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:38.460]  on like an 11-inch iPad, I feel like the audio
[01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:40.220]  could immerse yourself enough that you could forget
[01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:42.020]  you're on an airplane, and if you travel enough,
[01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:43.340]  that's a huge win, right?
[01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:44.340]  It's like.
[01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:46.260]  Yeah, you just have to dedicate yourself
[01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:47.780]  to traveling with these things in a way
[01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:49.780]  that you don't have to dedicate yourself
[01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:51.420]  to traveling with a pair of headphones
[01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:53.700]  that has more folding and articulation, right?
[01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:56.140]  So you gotta understand that trade-off going in.
[01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:59.180]  Like, I'm gonna create a dedicated space for these
[01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:02.140]  in my bag, and those are gonna go in there,
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:06.580]  but when I get on that 11-hour flight to the UK
[01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:08.700]  and I watch three movies and sleep
[01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:10.700]  and then watch another movie and then, you know,
[01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:12.140]  have a little breakfast or whatever,
[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:15.460]  you, I mean, hey, an 11-inch iPad or 13-inch iPad,
[01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:17.540]  two and a half feet from your face is the equivalent
[01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:19.540]  of an 80-inch screen, right?
[01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:22.060]  So that plus the headphones, and yeah,
[01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:24.260]  you've got yourself a really nice portable
[01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:26.860]  home theater setup, which doesn't,
[01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:31.180]  it doesn't really exist in the way that it exists here
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:34.540]  with existing 5.1-capable headphones
[01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:38.180]  because it is not, there's no two-way communication,
[01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:40.340]  and that is really, I think, where we're talking about
[01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:42.100]  like the hardware stuff in the,
[01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:44.180]  that's not in the Apple TV, how are they gonna figure that
[01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:45.740]  or can they do it in software?
[01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:48.540]  Because the iPad knows where the headphones are
[01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:49.500]  and vice versa.
[01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:52.140]  There is a two-way communication there,
[01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:55.340]  at least in orientation and a little bit in distance,
[01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:58.420]  right, because it does a ranging check,
[01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:00.620]  and so it kind of knows where you are
[01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:04.500]  and that back and forth calms is what keeps it locked in
[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:07.780]  and keeps it feeling like the soundstage is accurate
[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:10.140]  so that when you as a physical person are moving around
[01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:13.140]  in the soundstage, either your head or turning or whatever,
[01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:15.540]  the sound stays in the proper position,
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:18.220]  because what normally happens when you turn your head
[01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:20.420]  when you're watching a screen is that the center
[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:23.060]  of the soundstage travels with your face,
[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:25.220]  and so you're looking to the left,
[01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:27.060]  but the sound, and the soundstage is to the left,
[01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:28.220]  but the screen is to the right,
[01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:31.180]  and that difference is huge.
[01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:35.740]  It's the same difference that you see in VR headsets
[01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:38.660]  with good tracking, because the moment you lose tracking
[01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:40.740]  on that, your body's like, this ain't real,
[01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:42.140]  and by the way, I'm sick,
[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:47.100]  because their physical world doesn't match
[01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:48.300]  my inner ear, right?
[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:51.260]  And with a good tracking in a VR headset,
[01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:53.980]  it sells it immediately, it makes you feel immersed,
[01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:55.900]  it makes you feel like this is a real thing.
[01:23:55.900 --> 01:24:00.900]  Your body and your glands and your cerebellum
[01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:04.300]  are all working in conjunction to tell you,
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:07.060]  this thing is real, this is working, everything is cool,
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:09.300]  what you're seeing is real life.
[01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:13.380]  And that kind of two-way comms is what sets this apart
[01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:17.180]  from others 7.1 or 5.1 compatible headsets
[01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:19.460]  that do not have any communication
[01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:21.100]  with the device that they're watching it on,
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:25.780]  and that's the differentiation factor for now here.
[01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:29.820]  Yeah, it reminds me of an optical illusion.
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:32.660]  You know, there's a lot of them, there's the famous one,
[01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:35.580]  it looks like a chalice centered in a square,
[01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:36.940]  but if you stare at it long enough,
[01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:40.340]  it suddenly looks like two faces in profile staring at each other.
[01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:43.020]  Or Pepper's ghost with the mirrors and glass.
[01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:48.060]  Yeah, yeah, and it's like you put these on
[01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:49.820]  and you know you're doing spatial audio,
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:52.780]  and you're moving your head a little bit left to right,
[01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:54.540]  and you're like, oh yeah, yeah,
[01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:56.820]  and you're thinking about it.
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:24:59.420]  And no matter what you do, a minute in,
[01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:01.940]  you completely forget, and it's like,
[01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:04.420]  instead of studying the chalice,
[01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:08.300]  it's like you're just immersed, and it's uncanny.
[01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:10.900]  It really is, I cannot emphasize it enough,
[01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:14.940]  it is not a gimmick, it is a real thing
[01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:17.780]  that takes the headphone experience up to another level.
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:20.740]  And if you watch enough movies on an iPad,
[01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:23.460]  it is, it's seriously worthwhile.
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:26.780]  Anyway, just a good segue into our third and final sponsor,
[01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:30.180]  speaking of travel, Away, Away Suitcases.
[01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:33.340]  Look, travel is weird right now, no doubt about it,
[01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:35.820]  but no matter where you need to go this holiday season,
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:38.620]  Away offers a range of suitcases, bags,
[01:25:38.620 --> 01:25:41.500]  and other travel products made of different materials
[01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:45.780]  like polycarbonate, aluminum, and durable nylon
[01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:48.180]  in a variety of colors and sizes.
[01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:49.540]  So whatever you need to bring with you,
[01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:53.180]  Away has luggage that will make your trip more seamless,
[01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:58.020]  wherever it may be, wherever or whenever it may be.
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:00.260]  All of their suitcases from Away
[01:26:00.260 --> 01:26:01.700]  are designed to last a lifetime.
[01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:04.940]  Mine is years old at this point, still looks fantastic,
[01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:08.260]  wheels still roll great, can't say enough
[01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:10.660]  about the durability of this thing.
[01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:12.740]  And again, this is my overhead thing
[01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:14.940]  that takes the most abuse.
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:16.920]  With durable exteriors that can withstand
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:19.820]  even the roughest of baggage handlers,
[01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:22.940]  every suitcase comes with an interior organization system
[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:24.700]  that includes a built-in compression pad
[01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:26.060]  to help you pack more in.
[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:28.860]  I swear that works, really keeps your shirts
[01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:30.560]  nice and pressed, put them in there,
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.060]  cinch them in with a compression pad,
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:33.620]  then pile other stuff on top.
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:37.420]  And they have a hidden and removable laundry bag
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:38.780]  that separates your dirty clothes,
[01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:41.680]  and it's a great place to stash your dirty stuff
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:42.980]  while you're on your trip.
[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:46.100]  They've got those 360 spinner wheels
[01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:49.540]  that are guaranteed the smoothest roll, really great.
[01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:51.380]  TSA-approved combination lock,
[01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:53.660]  their newest line are made with a durable
[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:57.100]  water-resistant nylon exterior
[01:26:57.100 --> 01:26:58.780]  that is made to last a lifetime.
[01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:03.500]  And they're designed to expand by 1.75 inches,
[01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:06.340]  so you have the flexibility to pack even more on your trip,
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:08.380]  or less if you're packing less.
[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:11.660]  It's really great, they're just great products.
[01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:14.900]  They have good handles, they have the carry-ons,
[01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:19.080]  have built-in USB chargers, it's good, good, good stuff.
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:21.100]  I have one, or a couple actually,
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:24.140]  but the carry-on is my go-to that I never,
[01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:27.180]  I can't remember the last time I took a trip without it.
[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:30.220]  100-day trial on everything Away makes.
[01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:31.940]  Take the product out in the road, live with it,
[01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:35.020]  travel with it, even get lost with it for 100 days,
[01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:37.940]  and if it's not for you, you can return
[01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:40.580]  any non-personalized item for a full refund
[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:43.840]  during that period, no if, ands, or asterisks.
[01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:47.860]  Any part does break over the lifetime,

[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:51.540]  will arrange to have it fixed or replaced,
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:53.460]  and they offer free shipping and returns
[01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:55.900]  on any order in the contiguous US,

[01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:17.360]  to getting away next year, this holiday season.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:20.720]  That's awaytravel.com slash talkshow20.
[01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:25.400]  Before you go, I guess the other big thing,
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.420]  I don't know, we got all caught up talking about headphones
[01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:30.580]  and in the meantime, we haven't talked about
[01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:32.660]  the fact that Apple has completely moved
[01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:35.540]  the Macintosh platform to a new architecture.
[01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:37.560]  You know, just the little things.
[01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:44.220]  Oh gosh, yeah, well they did a lot this year, to be honest.
[01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:47.460]  I mean, given the year it's been, it's pretty crazy.
[01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:49.200]  That's just a month old.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.580]  Like, isn't that wild?
[01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:55.060]  Like, this is seriously like, from my interests,
[01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:58.200]  you know, as somebody who's, I'm interested in politics
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:01.160]  in normal years, and if you're interested in politics,
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:04.740]  a presidential election in the US is always a big deal.
[01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:08.140]  Needless to say, this just felt like a big one.
[01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:11.020]  A little bit, a little bit unusual.
[01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:14.420]  My entire professional life has been built
[01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:16.460]  around the Macintosh computer.
[01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:21.220]  It's kind of a big month for the Macintosh.
[01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:23.920]  Like, this has all been a month.
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:25.820]  It just seems crazy.
[01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:28.380]  Like, that is one thing, I'm at the point now
[01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:31.640]  with the M1 MacBook Pro where I'm so spoiled,
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:35.540]  where it's now, I'm over the part where it feels amazing
[01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:36.860]  and it feels normal.
[01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:39.000]  Yeah, and it's just everything else feels worse, right?
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:39.840]  Like, that's the, yeah.
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:40.780]  Everything else feels worse.
[01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:45.780]  And you know, just to speak to the onslaught part of it,
[01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:49.260]  you know, the M1 Mac, huge, huge, you know,
[01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:51.260]  change in architecture.
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:54.460]  Really a generational, once in a generation change,
[01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:59.380]  step change in capability for PCs and, you know,
[01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:01.600]  by PCs, I mean personal computers, right?
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:04.420]  And that goes for PCs that run Windows
[01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:06.020]  or any other platform.
[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:08.260]  These things are just better.
[01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:10.260]  And you can tell that even now where they're like,
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:12.080]  oh, this beats a more powerful PC
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:13.820]  or even a more powerful Mac, you know,
[01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:15.440]  or more powerful, I should say,
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:18.860]  this beats a hot top of the line previous one
[01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:22.020]  from ostensibly the high end of the line, right?
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:23.200]  Previous ones.
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:25.220]  And we know, everybody knows,
[01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:27.180]  and yes, there's been some talk about it,
[01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:29.340]  but really I don't think anybody's quite internalized it,
[01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:30.860]  that this is the entry level.
[01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:32.500]  Like, this is the beginning.
[01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:34.020]  This is just like, hey,
[01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:35.900]  what if I want to buy a cheap laptop?
[01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:36.740]  Oh, just get this one.
[01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:37.740]  It's probably the best on the market.
[01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:39.020]  It's $1,000, right?
[01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:41.500]  Like that's, and it's already beating those.
[01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:45.980]  So like the exponential shift in what PCs are capable of,
[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:47.060]  what computers are capable of,
[01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:48.580]  what Macs are capable of,
[01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:50.460]  portable computers are capable of,
[01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:51.960]  and what they can do,
[01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:53.460]  how far you can push the performance
[01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:55.980]  while still maintaining a usable battery
[01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:58.120]  and a usable mobile platform,
[01:30:58.120 --> 01:30:59.700]  we're just beginning to see that.
[01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:02.000]  And I don't think that people have internalized it yet at all
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.220]  because A, the tools need to be rebuilt
[01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:05.140]  to take advantage of it.
[01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:07.560]  And then new tools, new companies,
[01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:11.480]  new architectures that are just being spun up now,
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:12.860]  we're going to see them, you know,
[01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:15.140]  sort of appear over the next few years
[01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:18.300]  that take advantage of this kind of big change.
[01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:21.160]  Because you talk about the iPhone
[01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:23.500]  having had an enormous profound effect
[01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:27.100]  on the capability of software.
[01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:28.980]  I mean, entire billion dollar companies,
[01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:31.420]  Airbnb wouldn't exist without the iPhone.
[01:31:31.420 --> 01:31:33.480]  DoorDash wouldn't exist without the iPhone.
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:36.020]  You know, I don't give a crap about Android or not.
[01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:37.320]  It is not really about that.
[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:39.380]  You know, I'm not talking down Android or anything.
[01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:41.700]  But frankly, the App Store and the iPhone
[01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:44.500]  provided the ability for these companies to get fuel
[01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:47.620]  and to get access to people with a disposable income
[01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:49.660]  that wanted to spend money on, say, food delivery
[01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:52.240]  or vacation homes or whatever.
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:54.420]  All of these businesses were fueled
[01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:56.940]  by the rise of the iPhone and the App Store.
[01:31:56.940 --> 01:32:01.940]  And that, in turn, many other applications and those
[01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:05.180]  were fueled by the fact that the platform
[01:32:05.180 --> 01:32:09.080]  remained performant through its entire lifespan.
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:10.520]  You know, when the iPhone came out, it was like,
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:12.660]  oh, this is cool, I can actually process the web for real
[01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:14.180]  and it's kind of fast.
[01:32:14.180 --> 01:32:17.320]  And yeah, everybody complains about the speed of an iPhone
[01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:19.900]  or complained about it for the first couple of years.
[01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:24.020]  But since then, nobody's said anything in practical terms,
[01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:26.300]  aside from people running benchmarks,
[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:28.620]  about whether the iPhone is speedy or not.
[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:30.860]  It is speedy, period, it is.
[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:34.140]  And that's the era we're entering into with PCs, it's huge.
[01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:35.220]  It's a big change.
[01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:41.520]  And it's, I loved this from your,
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:43.940]  I just, I wanna get the numbers right, so I dialed it up.
[01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:47.820]  But from your M1 MacBook Pro review,
[01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:51.580]  as a real world benchmark, you compiled the WebKit project,
[01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:54.260]  which is, again, that's not an artificial benchmark.
[01:32:54.260 --> 01:32:57.580]  Now, is a typical person going to compile WebKit?
[01:32:57.580 --> 01:33:00.580]  No, of course not, but it is a real thing real people do.
[01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:03.600]  It's a real project and it's an interesting test.
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:07.020]  And the M1 MacBook Pro compiles the web,
[01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:10.300]  the whole source of WebKit in about 21 minutes.
[01:33:10.300 --> 01:33:15.060]  And the 13-inch MacBook Pro Intel from this year
[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:19.780]  was 46 minutes, 10 seconds, so over twice as long.
[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:23.540]  But the biggest difference was if you do this on battery,
[01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:26.960]  the M1, in addition to being a little over twice as fast,
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:31.960]  has 91, start with a full charge, 91% battery life left.
[01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:36.780]  And that's the same whether you're using the MacBook Pro
[01:33:36.780 --> 01:33:38.400]  or the MacBook Air.
[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:40.540]  And the 13-inch MacBook Pro from this year
[01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:43.140]  has 24% battery left.
[01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:43.980]  Yeah.
[01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:45.500]  Like, that's crazy.
[01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:46.340]  And then you did the-
[01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:47.580]  And behind, a little inside baseball,
[01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:48.940]  I thought those numbers were wrong.
[01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:51.140]  I thought I was screwing something up big time.
[01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:53.780]  So I actually had three people run it for me
[01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:56.980]  on their own machines and it had the same results.
[01:33:56.980 --> 01:33:58.660]  I would totally think that.
[01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:01.760]  I would look at those results and it's, you know,
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:04.740]  there's the sort of person who sees results like that
[01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:05.860]  and then they go, you know,
[01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:09.100]  it's like those guys in the 80s from Utah
[01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:10.820]  who ran to the New York Times
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:12.840]  and said they invented desktop fusion.
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:13.680]  Yes.
[01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:17.140]  You're like, uh, let's fact-check.
[01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:22.620]  There's the sort of person who sees results like that
[01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:24.540]  and is like, quick publish.
[01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:27.980]  And then there's the sort of person who thinks,
[01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:30.300]  wait, I better triple-check this
[01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:31.140]  because this is-
[01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:33.540]  Well, I always assume I'm the weakest link, so.
[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:35.940]  Yeah.
[01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:39.860]  But even the state-of-the-art 16-inch MacBook Pro,
[01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:42.700]  which is a lot bigger device and, you know,
[01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:44.720]  a lot more expensive,
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:49.720]  goes from 100% to 61% on one run through WebKit.
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:53.340]  Like, so the time makes a difference.
[01:34:53.340 --> 01:34:57.980]  Twice as fast is impressive and twice as fast on,
[01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:00.620]  and we're still talking about the consumer end
[01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:03.020]  of the notebooks, not the pro end.
[01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:06.260]  But the battery life thing is game-changing.
[01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:09.180]  Like, because what if you need to make a change
[01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:10.460]  and recompile it?
[01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:11.300]  Yep, yep.
[01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:13.900]  Then you can do this multiple times.
[01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:16.900]  And there's all sorts of things that people do that,
[01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:20.220]  you know, exporting video is huge.
[01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:22.540]  Lots of people export video.
[01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:25.800]  And it's, you know, it grinds your computer.
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:27.580]  And, you know, all of a sudden you realize
[01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:29.940]  you've misspelled somebody's name in the credit
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:32.140]  and you've gotta export it again, you know?
[01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:34.540]  We screwed up.
[01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:37.100]  You know, that one shot in this,
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:39.060]  we didn't color correct.
[01:35:39.060 --> 01:35:41.300]  Ah, you have to bang out the whole thing.
[01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:44.100]  You know, you can't just fix the one thing.
[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:47.220]  So, you know, if you can do that multiple times
[01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:49.740]  and you're in the field, you're in the airport,
[01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:52.020]  you're somewhere and you're on battery,
[01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:53.820]  you're doing, you're working on a plane,
[01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:57.260]  you can do this, it is, that's night and day.
[01:35:57.260 --> 01:35:58.420]  That's a totally different thing.
[01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:01.700]  And like you said, it's only the consumer end so far.
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:02.520]  Right.
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:03.900]  Which is crazy.
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:06.180]  So that leads me to, you know,
[01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:08.220]  Germin had a report this week talking about like,
[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:12.500]  hey, where are they going with the future M series chips
[01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:14.460]  for the rest of the lineup?
[01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:17.640]  And, you know, one of the big questions people have is,
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:22.240]  what are their plans for GPUs in the pro models?
[01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:26.120]  I've been thinking, I've been thinking even before
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:30.460]  we saw the first M1, Max, I've been thinking ever since,
[01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:32.900]  even before they announced this stuff at WWDC,
[01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:34.720]  that they're gonna do it all themselves.
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:37.220]  That they're done depending on other people.
[01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:38.060]  Right.
[01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:40.820]  They're too big a company, it's too important.
[01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:43.220]  Yeah, when you see how central the GPU is
[01:36:43.220 --> 01:36:45.340]  to the modern compute landscape, you know,
[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:47.720]  everything from AI to, you know,
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:52.360]  even the GPU taking over UI for a lot of applications,
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:54.780]  you know, from the CPU, there's just very,
[01:36:54.780 --> 01:36:58.500]  it's actually funny because there's a lot,
[01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:02.540]  a grand percentage less CPU bound operations on a PC
[01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:03.940]  than there was 10 years ago.
[01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:08.100]  Right, and it's in it, and combine that,
[01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:10.980]  so the centrality of GPU, period, no matter,
[01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:14.760]  even if you're just using a stock Windows Intel system,
[01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:18.900]  the centrality of the GPU to modern computing
[01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:22.100]  is one reason that they would take it just as seriously
[01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:24.580]  and do it all themselves the way they do CPU.
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:27.620]  But then combine that, it's like a multiplier,
[01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:29.540]  it's not just like an asterisk or a footnote,
[01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:33.860]  it's a multiplier with the way that the M1 shows
[01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:36.180]  that putting them all on the same chip
[01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:39.300]  and having them designed to work together
[01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:42.220]  makes everything faster, right, like,
[01:37:42.220 --> 01:37:44.540]  and so there's certain things that used to be
[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:48.220]  like dirty words, like shared memory, right,
[01:37:48.220 --> 01:37:51.180]  like oh, shared memory, you know, that was a compromise,
[01:37:51.180 --> 01:37:53.360]  because it just happened to be that the systems
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:56.020]  that use shared memory between a GPU and CPU
[01:37:56.020 --> 01:37:59.200]  were low-end GPU systems, like, you know,
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:02.000]  long battery life consumer laptops.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  Or, you know, the discrete GPU versus integrated GPU, right?
[01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:12.260]  It's a dirty word, integrated GPU,
[01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:16.180]  because it meant bad GPU, bad low-power.
[01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:18.580]  Yeah, yeah, it became a dirty word very quickly,
[01:38:18.580 --> 01:38:20.500]  it's like, oh, that's the bare minimum
[01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:22.020]  to get this thing to run.
[01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:23.020]  Right. Yeah.
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:25.700]  Right, and so you, you know, for the most part,
[01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:30.440]  above just, like, the words just describe how they work,
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:35.100]  but what people hear is, oh, discrete GPU
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:40.100]  means powerful GPU, and integrated GPU means weak GPU,
[01:38:41.260 --> 01:38:45.580]  and that's just, that's just how things were,
[01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:47.540]  that's not how they have to be, right,
[01:38:47.540 --> 01:38:52.540]  and the shared memory on the M1 isn't a,
[01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:54.900]  well, okay, it's a consumer laptop,
[01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:56.920]  no, that's how this is so much faster,
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:59.740]  because anything that gets handed off,
[01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:01.860]  like, oh, you wanna do this transformation
[01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:05.780]  on this big photo, we'll let the GPU do it,
[01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:08.420]  you don't have to copy the memory over anymore,
[01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:11.340]  and every single time, and this doesn't matter how fast,
[01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:15.060]  you know, and the M1 has very fast memory bandwidth,
[01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:16.540]  but it doesn't matter how fast it is,
[01:39:16.540 --> 01:39:18.800]  if you don't have to copy in the first place,
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:23.800]  you're saving, it's an infinite performance increase, right?
[01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:26.900]  Because you're not copying.
[01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:31.780]  And I just feel like that is definitely going to happen
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:33.420]  with the Pro machines, and it's just,
[01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:38.280]  people are a little, I think that so many people
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:40.820]  don't realize how off on their own Apple is
[01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:45.820]  with this stuff, right, and so many of the questions
[01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:47.580]  when the M1 was about to come out,
[01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:50.940]  or when it just did come out from other members of the media
[01:39:50.940 --> 01:39:55.940]  were framing it based on Windows ARM systems,
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:58.860]  because, well, these chips are using ARM,
[01:39:58.860 --> 01:40:01.300]  and those chips use ARM, and they were not that,
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:05.620]  they're very slow, and there's a lot of compromises in there
[01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:08.860]  and it's like, just because they're both using
[01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:10.900]  the ARM instruction set doesn't mean
[01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:13.140]  they're any more comparable than the fact
[01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:16.340]  that like the, what was the name of the chip
[01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:21.020]  in the 12-inch MacBook, the Intel M?
[01:40:21.020 --> 01:40:23.100]  Oh, yeah, I can't remember.
[01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:25.700]  Yeah, I can't remember what that thing was.
[01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:29.340]  Well, whatever that little chip was was x86,
[01:40:29.340 --> 01:40:33.700]  and the Xeon chips in the Mac Pro are x86,
[01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:35.580]  and the fact that they're both x86
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:39.980]  doesn't mean they have any shared performance characteristics
[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:44.660]  in terms of power or speed, and the fact that,
[01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:49.660]  you know, Windows Surface laptops are based on ARM chips,
[01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:54.860]  and the M1 is based on the ARM architecture chips
[01:40:54.860 --> 01:40:57.780]  doesn't mean they share any performance characteristics
[01:40:57.780 --> 01:41:01.540]  at all, and so beginning your framing of it that way
[01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:04.140]  is just the wrong way to look at it, in my opinion,
[01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:08.700]  and the fact that Apple hasn't shown us
[01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:13.700]  Pro GPU silicon from their own design
[01:41:13.980 --> 01:41:15.460]  doesn't mean they can't do it.
[01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:18.180]  I mean, it's exciting, and it's a big thing
[01:41:18.180 --> 01:41:20.780]  I'm looking forward to in 2021 is, you know,
[01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:23.540]  at some point they're going to show it to us this year,
[01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:26.260]  but I believe they can do it.
[01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:29.700]  I don't, and that might be one of the reasons
[01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:32.860]  why they didn't make this transition a year or two earlier.
[01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:34.700]  Like maybe, you know, CPU-wise,
[01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:37.380]  clearly they could have done it earlier.
[01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:42.380]  Maybe GPU-wise, to do it from the top of the Mac Pro lineup
[01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:45.740]  all the way to the consumer laptops, they needed more time,
[01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:46.700]  but I think it's coming.
[01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:49.300]  I think it's, and I think that this idea
[01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:52.100]  of calling them discrete GPUs and integrated GPUs,
[01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:52.940]  forget about it.
[01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:54.740]  Mm-hmm, yeah.
[01:41:54.740 --> 01:41:59.180]  I don't think that there is an analog either
[01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:03.060]  to allow people to draw easy comparisons,
[01:42:03.060 --> 01:42:05.580]  and I think that's one of the problems
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:07.220]  or one of the reasons that we're seeing,
[01:42:07.220 --> 01:42:09.180]  we initially saw so much mismatch,
[01:42:09.180 --> 01:42:12.500]  but in opinion, you know, versus performance,
[01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:15.340]  because there was certainly, I mean, I'm not, you know,
[01:42:15.340 --> 01:42:18.180]  he sort of has a reputation as somebody
[01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:19.980]  who doesn't mind staking opinions
[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:22.860]  even if they're quite dramatically wrong,
[01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:25.580]  or I shouldn't say wrong, but even, you know,
[01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:28.340]  he's like, hey, I'm willing to be the guy who says this,
[01:42:28.340 --> 01:42:30.300]  but Linus from Linus Tech Tips, you know,
[01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:32.340]  he generally goes out there and is like,
[01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:35.980]  hey, I'm gonna plant a flag while everybody knows,
[01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:37.060]  you know, that I'm planting a flag
[01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:39.140]  that may very well be challenged or whatever,
[01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:41.420]  he's willing to sort of do that,
[01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:44.580]  but I generally find that I'm okay
[01:42:44.580 --> 01:42:46.060]  with the way that he goes about it.
[01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:48.660]  He's not being petulant, he's being opinionated, right?
[01:42:48.660 --> 01:42:50.100]  And there's a difference,
[01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:52.340]  and so he definitely came out and said,
[01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:55.020]  oh, and one, you know, good luck,
[01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:56.580]  this is never gonna work the way
[01:42:56.580 --> 01:42:57.620]  that they say it's gonna work,
[01:42:57.620 --> 01:43:00.420]  they're saying it's desktop class and all of this stuff,
[01:43:00.420 --> 01:43:02.340]  and it's just, you know, here's the reasons
[01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:04.460]  that I believe that that's marketing,
[01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:07.100]  essentially snowblowing versus something real.
[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:08.460]  And then, you know, to his credit,
[01:43:08.460 --> 01:43:11.020]  came back after the announcement and was like,
[01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:13.460]  uh, yeah, so here's all the reasons I was wrong,
[01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:16.300]  and this is actually a pretty intensely, you know,
[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:18.940]  performant chip and very indicative
[01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:21.540]  that they could do some really cool stuff in the future,
[01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:23.700]  right, and I do believe that that disconnect
[01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:27.500]  obviously comes largely from UMA, you know,
[01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:30.580]  from the unified memory architecture community,
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:33.500]  you know, transmitting so much performance gains
[01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:38.620]  to the CPU and that integration there,
[01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:41.020]  and I think the same conversation is gonna happen again
[01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:44.340]  when we come to GPUs, because NVIDIA and AMD
[01:43:44.340 --> 01:43:47.100]  certainly have like a death grip on that industry
[01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:50.700]  and are battling it out, you know, release after release
[01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:52.980]  for the most performant graphics chip on the market
[01:43:52.980 --> 01:43:54.060]  and all of this stuff,
[01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:57.460]  but they aren't systems manufacturers.
[01:43:57.460 --> 01:44:00.540]  They cannot tell the rest of the system
[01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:02.860]  how to act in a certain way.
[01:44:02.860 --> 01:44:05.020]  They're certainly more integrated than ever,
[01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:07.620]  like, because every Windows laptop maker
[01:44:07.620 --> 01:44:09.260]  and motherboard maker wants to make sure
[01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:11.260]  that they work great with the new NVIDIA,
[01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:12.100]  you know, graphics chip,
[01:44:12.100 --> 01:44:13.940]  because otherwise people won't buy them, right?
[01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:16.260]  It's like a big driver of sales for gaming
[01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:18.820]  and for specialized applications,
[01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:21.460]  but they don't make those systems.
[01:44:21.460 --> 01:44:24.100]  They can't build them from the ground up
[01:44:24.100 --> 01:44:25.780]  to work perfectly with them,
[01:44:25.780 --> 01:44:30.140]  and at the end of the day, they are still a peripheral.
[01:44:30.140 --> 01:44:32.380]  They are at the edge of the system
[01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:36.020]  or at one edge of the system talking to the system,
[01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:40.380]  whereas the M1 is not a peripheral, it is the system,
[01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:42.740]  you know, and the M1's graphics processing
[01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:45.540]  and M1's memory architecture is the system,
[01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:48.300]  and that huge kind of step change
[01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:51.860]  in the way that we think about systems integrations
[01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:54.580]  I believe will forever change the way we, you know,
[01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:57.020]  process those words, integrated graphics, right?
[01:44:57.020 --> 01:45:01.020]  It may redeem the term forever in a way that, you know,
[01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:03.780]  we really haven't seen much happen much.
[01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:04.620]  You know, everybody's like,
[01:45:04.620 --> 01:45:06.260]  hey, external GPUs are the thing,
[01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:08.300]  so very interesting time ahead.
[01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:13.260]  And part of this is a mindset difference
[01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:17.100]  that hasn't changed in 25, 30 years, right?
[01:45:17.100 --> 01:45:19.820]  I think back to the 90s, and I remember a very,
[01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:21.460]  I forget the guy, I forget his name,
[01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:22.740]  but I remember the argument.
[01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:24.940]  There was a guy in the Drexel dorms
[01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:28.100]  who was more of a PC enthusiast,
[01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:32.140]  and Drexel was very, famously was one of these
[01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:35.780]  Macintosh campuses where you had to have access
[01:45:35.780 --> 01:45:40.780]  to a Mac to do coursework, and he was nonplussed about it.
[01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:44.820]  Like, I think he brought his PC then,
[01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:48.740]  so he had like a PC and a Mac on his tiny little dorm desk.
[01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:53.740]  And I remember this argument with him about sound cards,
[01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:57.780]  and I was like, take a step back, isn't this crazy?
[01:45:57.780 --> 01:46:01.820]  It's crazy that you need to buy a separate sound card
[01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:05.300]  and get sound drivers and make sure they're compatible
[01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:07.100]  and keep them up to date.
[01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:10.380]  Like, you shouldn't be able to have a computer
[01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:14.060]  that doesn't make sound unless you, or, you know,
[01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:16.860]  the only sound that a PC without a sound card
[01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:19.420]  in the 90s can make was like a 16 kilohertz,
[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:21.780]  you know, like, doorbell ring, you know?
[01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:26.300]  Like, it was like a chiptone type thing
[01:46:26.300 --> 01:46:28.060]  unless you bought a sound card
[01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:31.340]  and you had to keep the drives, like, this is crazy.
[01:46:31.340 --> 01:46:32.500]  It should all just work.
[01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:35.180]  Why shouldn't, why are you designing it, right?
[01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:36.660]  And that's still, like, okay,
[01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:38.300]  sound cards aren't really a thing anymore,
[01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:40.660]  but graphic cards still are, right?
[01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:44.820]  It's still that mindset that if you become an enthusiast
[01:46:44.820 --> 01:46:48.500]  and you really care, you pick these components
[01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:51.740]  and put them together, and sure,
[01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:53.980]  Apple never really was into that, you know,
[01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:55.980]  like, you can't just put any,
[01:46:56.900 --> 01:47:00.580]  you can't put an Nvidia GPU in a Mac Pro, period, right?
[01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:03.500]  They did just, you know, it's not Windows.
[01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:07.140]  You know, and Apple's divorce with Nvidia, you know,
[01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:11.260]  four or five years ago, you know, is never gonna heal
[01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:14.100]  at this point, but it's still, like, Apple.
[01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:16.060]  The window for that to heal and Nvidia
[01:47:16.060 --> 01:47:18.580]  to integrate deeply has passed, you know?
[01:47:18.580 --> 01:47:20.820]  Now it's Apple going, nah, we're gonna do it.
[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:24.980]  But building their Macs on the Intel architecture
[01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:27.980]  meant that Apple had to do these component choices.
[01:47:27.980 --> 01:47:31.500]  Okay, we'll support these GPUs from AMD
[01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:33.180]  and we'll support the switching
[01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:36.820]  between the integrated Intel GPU and the AMD
[01:47:36.820 --> 01:47:39.660]  that we add to the 16-inch MacBook Pro,
[01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:42.940]  and we'll write the stuff in the OS
[01:47:42.940 --> 01:47:47.380]  to know when to get into that and go back to this.
[01:47:47.380 --> 01:47:49.900]  We'll do that, but it's like, ultimately,
[01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:52.700]  the experience should just be, no, just turn it on
[01:47:52.700 --> 01:47:55.100]  and it has good graphics, right?
[01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:57.820]  I mean, and I feel like that's the reckoning
[01:47:57.820 --> 01:48:00.500]  that, like, Linus, Linus Tech,
[01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:01.540]  I don't know what his last name is,
[01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:03.980]  but I know what you're talking, he called it,
[01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:06.340]  he was calling it iPad chips.
[01:48:06.340 --> 01:48:10.580]  That was, and again, I get it, I get the perspective,
[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:13.140]  but it's like, dude, you're not getting it.
[01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:15.940]  I think one way Apple sandbagged everybody, too,
[01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:19.540]  and I checked on this, I never signed up to get a dev kit
[01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:22.420]  because I didn't really have a reason for,
[01:48:22.420 --> 01:48:25.820]  and I didn't think it would be worthwhile,
[01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:29.900]  and I asked around, and people who I trusted at Apple
[01:48:29.900 --> 01:48:34.340]  to give me an honest answer, no, don't get a dev kit
[01:48:34.340 --> 01:48:36.420]  just to sort of correct yourself.
[01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:40.500]  To see what the M1 era is gonna be like, yeah.
[01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:43.700]  Right, I was told, no, it's not worth it.
[01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:45.740]  It's not indicative.
[01:48:45.740 --> 01:48:48.780]  It is really, truly for compatibility.
[01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:51.140]  It is truly valuable for developers
[01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:53.300]  to test binary compatibility.
[01:48:53.300 --> 01:48:56.260]  It is not indicative at all, and we're not just saying that.
[01:48:56.260 --> 01:48:58.020]  Yeah, it's not some sort of sneak preview
[01:48:58.020 --> 01:49:00.900]  that's gonna give you a good insight, yeah.
[01:49:00.900 --> 01:49:02.940]  Right, and so I've talked to some friends who have,
[01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:05.500]  you know, lots and lots of developers have them
[01:49:05.500 --> 01:49:06.820]  because they want to be compatible,
[01:49:06.820 --> 01:49:09.060]  and I was like, hey, am I not,
[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:11.300]  like, nobody was raving about the performance
[01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:12.460]  of those dev kits, and they're like,
[01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:13.740]  yeah, the dev kits weren't great.
[01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:14.580]  They're not bad.
[01:49:14.580 --> 01:49:16.820]  It's not like you were running stuff in molasses,
[01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:18.620]  and I think, like,
[01:49:18.620 --> 01:49:20.420]  But it was there just to see, hey, will it compile,
[01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:22.580]  will it run, will it get out the door?
[01:49:22.580 --> 01:49:27.580]  But none of these amazing feats of computing performance
[01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:29.900]  were evident on the dev kit.
[01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:32.700]  It just wasn't there, but I kind of think
[01:49:32.700 --> 01:49:36.660]  that that framed people's perspectives
[01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:39.620]  that whatever the M chips were going to be,
[01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:42.020]  they were going to be like that, right?
[01:49:42.020 --> 01:49:46.220]  Like, I feel like your Linus-type people
[01:49:46.220 --> 01:49:50.460]  who were coming at it from a skeptical perspective
[01:49:50.460 --> 01:49:53.380]  saw what people were saying about the dev kits
[01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:56.380]  and thought that was going to be,
[01:49:56.380 --> 01:49:59.620]  that was indicative of what they would ship,
[01:49:59.620 --> 01:50:02.260]  and those wouldn't be bad, right?
[01:50:02.260 --> 01:50:04.220]  Like, if they shipped a Mac mini
[01:50:04.220 --> 01:50:05.860]  that performed like a dev kit.
[01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:07.940]  Yeah, exactly, the first generation was like,
[01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:10.620]  hey, as performant or slightly less performant
[01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:13.580]  than current models, I think they would have gotten
[01:50:13.580 --> 01:50:14.980]  a total pass.
[01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:17.580]  Like, nobody was expecting anything more than that.
[01:50:18.420 --> 01:50:22.260]  Right, it just wouldn't have gotten raves.
[01:50:22.260 --> 01:50:24.740]  It wouldn't be seen as a breakthrough.
[01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:27.180]  It was like, huh, you know, it ends up
[01:50:27.180 --> 01:50:31.020]  that the dev kit performs exactly like, you know,
[01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:34.180]  like a low-end Intel Mac, you know, roughly the same.
[01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:37.780]  But I really felt like that sandbagged
[01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:40.020]  people's perspectives in terms of thinking
[01:50:40.020 --> 01:50:42.020]  that that was all they were capable of.
[01:50:43.140 --> 01:50:46.700]  And I kind of feel like it might be happening again,
[01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:48.500]  where people are thinking, okay,
[01:50:48.500 --> 01:50:50.300]  this is the best Apple can do.
[01:50:50.300 --> 01:50:54.020]  And so these are, you know,
[01:50:54.020 --> 01:50:55.980]  this isn't great if you're a pro user.
[01:50:55.980 --> 01:50:58.700]  I have some friends who have worked on this project
[01:50:58.700 --> 01:51:02.420]  over the years, and, you know, I do feel that there are,
[01:51:02.420 --> 01:51:06.260]  the perception ahead of time, while, you know,
[01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:09.860]  it wasn't like I was getting some sort of grand view
[01:51:09.860 --> 01:51:12.060]  into what they were up to, just like, oh yeah,
[01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:14.180]  you know, working on this thing, it's pretty cool.
[01:51:14.180 --> 01:51:18.940]  But I think that there is a general vibe inside Apple
[01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:23.540]  that they were afraid to tip their hand to Intel.
[01:51:23.540 --> 01:51:25.980]  And not in terms of, I mean, I'm talking about
[01:51:25.980 --> 01:51:29.340]  the time period even after they announced it, right?
[01:51:29.340 --> 01:51:31.700]  So like, I think that even before they announced it,
[01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:33.260]  for sure, like they didn't want to tip their hand
[01:51:33.260 --> 01:51:38.260]  to Intel big time, you know, before they were ready.
[01:51:38.260 --> 01:51:39.980]  Because then, you know, there are all kinds of problems
[01:51:39.980 --> 01:51:41.660]  with negotiation and like, you know,
[01:51:41.660 --> 01:51:44.340]  Intel probably gets pissed or gets irritated.
[01:51:44.340 --> 01:51:46.300]  I mean, Intel, if they're not stupid,
[01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:48.780]  they knew this was coming eventually, especially years out.
[01:51:48.780 --> 01:51:50.460]  If pundits are saying it on the internet,
[01:51:50.460 --> 01:51:52.660]  Intel, who's in the business, knows, right?
[01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:55.500]  But there certainly was, there's a difference
[01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:57.260]  between, hey, they may do it someday
[01:51:57.260 --> 01:51:58.340]  and they're gonna do it next year
[01:51:58.340 --> 01:51:59.740]  and then ship it the year after or whatever,
[01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:01.380]  or ship it like six months later.
[01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:04.220]  And like that, I think, is a big difference.
[01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:06.420]  And they were afraid to tip their hand
[01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:08.500]  because they knew they had something special,
[01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:10.380]  but it had to be ready, you know?
[01:52:10.380 --> 01:52:14.420]  And they knew, though, that once they did tip their hand,
[01:52:14.420 --> 01:52:17.500]  it was all over, like the Intel relationship was done,
[01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:19.540]  you know, just absolutely done, done.
[01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:22.900]  And that they felt they had something special enough
[01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:26.180]  to the industry that it would change things massively
[01:52:26.180 --> 01:52:28.900]  forever in terms of what people expect
[01:52:28.900 --> 01:52:32.060]  from a performant chip and a performant portable machine,
[01:52:32.060 --> 01:52:34.900]  especially, and frankly, a performant machine of any sort,
[01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:36.580]  we'll see eventually.
[01:52:36.580 --> 01:52:38.660]  They knew that it would change things so much overnight
[01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:40.060]  that they didn't, they were afraid
[01:52:40.060 --> 01:52:41.260]  that it would get out too early.
[01:52:41.260 --> 01:52:43.020]  And I think there was a lot of,
[01:52:43.020 --> 01:52:44.660]  a lot of secrecy and worry about that
[01:52:44.660 --> 01:52:47.860]  because they knew Intel was in fact screwed,
[01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:49.420]  you know, from that perspective
[01:52:49.420 --> 01:52:52.660]  and unable to, at least very immediately,
[01:52:52.660 --> 01:52:54.540]  compete in any real way, shape, or form
[01:52:54.540 --> 01:52:56.900]  with the kind of performance that they were gonna see.
[01:52:56.900 --> 01:52:59.180]  And they were very, very nervous about it getting out
[01:52:59.180 --> 01:53:02.380]  because they knew, because then it was a big thing.
[01:53:02.380 --> 01:53:05.660]  So I'm not surprised that they stand back, you know?
[01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:08.700]  Yeah, and I think that that also,
[01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:12.660]  I think slash actually know from talking to my friends
[01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:16.340]  that that is a big part of the explanation
[01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:20.500]  of why the industrial design didn't change is the secrecy,
[01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:25.340]  that for a long stretch, when the go button was hit,
[01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:27.340]  I mean, everybody knew,
[01:53:27.340 --> 01:53:29.380]  everybody knew this was coming eventually,
[01:53:29.380 --> 01:53:32.900]  but like when the, okay, we are actually off to the races
[01:53:32.900 --> 01:53:34.380]  and we're doing this for real
[01:53:34.380 --> 01:53:36.540]  and we're committing to it internally,
[01:53:36.540 --> 01:53:38.420]  it was typical for Apple,
[01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:42.220]  even though this is like a major architecture change
[01:53:42.220 --> 01:53:47.060]  to their oldest and longest standing platform
[01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:52.060]  and biggest platform by scope, very few people knew.
[01:53:52.420 --> 01:53:55.180]  And so how do you keep the fewest people knowing
[01:53:55.180 --> 01:53:56.540]  for the longest time?
[01:53:56.540 --> 01:54:00.380]  Well, you start making hardware for late 2020
[01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:01.900]  that looks exactly the same.
[01:54:01.900 --> 01:54:03.460]  Exactly the same.
[01:54:03.460 --> 01:54:04.300]  Right.
[01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:05.140]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:09.060]  Oh, by the way, we're gonna put this new motherboard in.
[01:54:09.060 --> 01:54:10.020]  Don't worry about why.
[01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:11.780]  It's just, you know, it's cool.
[01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:13.220]  You know, just a little change, right?
[01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:14.380]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:16.860]  You can keep the same plan, that's fine.
[01:54:16.860 --> 01:54:17.700]  Don't worry.
[01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:20.220]  Exactly, yeah.
[01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:23.020]  Yeah, but you know, little things like the webcam,
[01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:26.060]  you know, lots of people dunking on the webcam
[01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:30.540]  didn't change as a camera device.
[01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:35.540]  It's just that the image processing chain changed completely
[01:54:35.580 --> 01:54:37.860]  and it improved dramatically, you know.
[01:54:37.860 --> 01:54:41.180]  It's still, you know, it is what it is photographically,
[01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:43.900]  but the picture quality is definitely bigger, better.
[01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:48.500]  But, and I think also too, in addition to the secrecy,
[01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:50.580]  there was definitely a sort of,
[01:54:50.580 --> 01:54:52.460]  look, this is such a big change.
[01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:55.580]  We know we can do it, but it's such a big change.
[01:54:55.580 --> 01:54:58.780]  Every variable we can remove from the equation
[01:54:58.780 --> 01:55:02.180]  is reducing the chance of something going wrong.
[01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:03.300]  Yes, yes.
[01:55:03.300 --> 01:55:06.740]  And so look, we know that now that, you know,
[01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:08.060]  once they fixed the keyboard
[01:55:08.060 --> 01:55:11.900]  and went back to a new scissor switch mechanism,
[01:55:11.900 --> 01:55:14.380]  the hardware for these machines is fine.
[01:55:14.380 --> 01:55:15.740]  You can say it's not exciting
[01:55:15.740 --> 01:55:18.060]  because it's been mostly unchanged,
[01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:19.820]  except for a keyboard that looks the same
[01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:21.060]  and just works the way it probably
[01:55:21.060 --> 01:55:22.620]  should have worked all along.
[01:55:23.740 --> 01:55:27.700]  But removing variables while you're changing
[01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:31.060]  the single biggest variable, the architecture.
[01:55:31.060 --> 01:55:32.380]  It's smart, yeah.
[01:55:32.380 --> 01:55:33.220]  It's the smart way to play.
[01:55:33.220 --> 01:55:36.580]  Right, it's just, it's a scientific approach
[01:55:36.580 --> 01:55:37.540]  to doing it, right?
[01:55:37.540 --> 01:55:40.580]  Like just, you know, okay, we know this display.
[01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:42.060]  We know everything we need to know about
[01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:43.700]  the display characteristics.
[01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:45.220]  We know this hinge, right?
[01:55:45.220 --> 01:55:47.540]  This is a hinge for the display
[01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:51.620]  that we know is durable and pleasant
[01:55:51.620 --> 01:55:54.340]  and let's, you know, let's not take the chance
[01:55:54.340 --> 01:55:56.700]  that we ship a new hinge and, oh, in the real world.
[01:55:56.700 --> 01:55:58.980]  Oh, the M1 Macs are great, but they snap in half.
[01:55:58.980 --> 01:56:00.500]  Oh, man, you know?
[01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:01.940]  Right, right.
[01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:04.820]  Or, you know, all of a sudden, three months in,
[01:56:04.820 --> 01:56:06.460]  it starts squeaking or something like that.
[01:56:06.460 --> 01:56:07.300]  You don't have to worry about it.
[01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:09.540]  Yeah, then it becomes the squeak Mac Pro or whatever,
[01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:12.820]  you know, so, yeah, it gets meme-ified.
[01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:17.460]  But anyway, I do think, so the only other question
[01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:20.260]  I know, and I mentioned it on Daring Fireball
[01:56:20.260 --> 01:56:22.100]  and a few readers said, well, the other question
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:25.220]  in addition to whether Apple's gonna do their own GPUs
[01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:28.500]  is what are they gonna do about RAM on memory
[01:56:28.500 --> 01:56:30.020]  on high-level machines?
[01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:35.020]  Is it always going to be on the chip for all the machines?
[01:56:35.020 --> 01:56:40.020]  I think no, I think that the Pro, I don't know about,
[01:56:41.540 --> 01:56:46.060]  I would guess that even on the Pro 16-inch MacBooks
[01:56:46.060 --> 01:56:47.340]  that they will still be on the chip
[01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:50.380]  because they haven't offered user-upgradable RAM
[01:56:50.380 --> 01:56:53.260]  on even MacBook Pros for a long time, right?
[01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:56.260]  Right, you buy a configuration and that's your configuration.
[01:56:58.100 --> 01:57:00.980]  For the Mac Pro, I would guess, though,
[01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:02.780]  that it will still be modular
[01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:04.500]  and that there's some different arc.
[01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:07.060]  It just doesn't make sense that you would say
[01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:08.420]  if you're gonna build a machine
[01:57:08.420 --> 01:57:11.260]  that goes up to a terabyte of RAM,
[01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:13.820]  and the fact that they did a terabyte of RAM
[01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:16.740]  in the Intel Mac Pro, they're not gonna go back, right,
[01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:18.300]  and say, oh, well, all of a sudden,
[01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:19.500]  now that we're on Apple Silicon,
[01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:21.020]  the most you can put in a Mac Pro
[01:57:21.020 --> 01:57:24.260]  is 256 gigabytes or something.
[01:57:24.260 --> 01:57:26.180]  You don't make a machine capable
[01:57:26.180 --> 01:57:27.980]  of going up to a terabyte of RAM
[01:57:27.980 --> 01:57:30.700]  and then say to somebody who configures it
[01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:33.060]  with 256 gigabytes, you know,
[01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:36.060]  and they're obviously already spending a small fortune.
[01:57:36.060 --> 01:57:38.580]  Oh, and if you ever decide you do need more,
[01:57:38.580 --> 01:57:40.140]  you've gotta buy a whole new machine.
[01:57:40.140 --> 01:57:41.660]  Yeah, it doesn't make sense.
[01:57:41.660 --> 01:57:42.500]  Yeah, it doesn't.
[01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:45.100]  I don't know how they do it.
[01:57:45.100 --> 01:57:47.660]  I don't know what the electrical engineering aspect of it
[01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:50.180]  that they keep it as performant as having it on chip,
[01:57:50.180 --> 01:57:52.940]  but I would guess with memory on the desktops,
[01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:55.700]  it will still be modular in some way.
[01:57:55.700 --> 01:57:59.380]  Maybe there will be some on the chip and some off,
[01:57:59.380 --> 01:58:01.620]  but I would guess that that will still be modular.
[01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:04.060]  Yeah, that'd be my bet if you were gonna ask me
[01:58:04.060 --> 01:58:06.980]  how, what would be the setup,
[01:58:06.980 --> 01:58:10.820]  is there will still be some sort of base memory
[01:58:10.820 --> 01:58:12.220]  that is integrated, you know,
[01:58:12.220 --> 01:58:14.300]  that's the part of that universal pool,
[01:58:14.300 --> 01:58:18.540]  and then additional memory for larger operations
[01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:20.660]  would be off chip, and therefore, you know,
[01:58:20.660 --> 01:58:23.660]  yes, would be less performant than integrated,
[01:58:23.660 --> 01:58:27.780]  but I think that let's say you were able to offer a Mac Pro
[01:58:27.780 --> 01:58:28.940]  and you go, oh, you know,
[01:58:28.940 --> 01:58:31.780]  I'm gonna get the 32 gigabyte Mac Pro, right?
[01:58:31.780 --> 01:58:33.860]  Or the 64 gigabyte Mac Pro,
[01:58:33.860 --> 01:58:35.820]  and then it's got RAM slots on it
[01:58:35.820 --> 01:58:37.580]  that you can add up to terabyte
[01:58:37.580 --> 01:58:39.360]  or two terabytes more or whatever,
[01:58:40.260 --> 01:58:45.100]  but the 32 gigabytes is incredibly performant, right?
[01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:48.660]  And you maybe don't use that external memory
[01:58:48.660 --> 01:58:50.260]  for many operations at all,
[01:58:50.260 --> 01:58:52.420]  and it's only the operations that require
[01:58:52.420 --> 01:58:55.940]  storing enormous textures or enormous libraries in,
[01:58:55.940 --> 01:58:58.300]  you know, in them that it actually taps into them at all.
[01:58:58.300 --> 01:59:02.100]  So the vast majority of your operations
[01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:03.820]  are much more performant,
[01:59:03.820 --> 01:59:06.820]  and then the small subset of those operations
[01:59:06.820 --> 01:59:09.540]  that require that larger memory pool
[01:59:09.540 --> 01:59:11.060]  are maybe slightly less performant,
[01:59:11.060 --> 01:59:13.980]  but still get the benefits of UMA on top of it
[01:59:13.980 --> 01:59:16.860]  so they're better than the Mac Pro previous, right?
[01:59:16.860 --> 01:59:19.300]  Like that's my, if I had to articulate the scenario,
[01:59:19.300 --> 01:59:20.620]  that's the way I would look at it.
[01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:22.420]  Right, right, like if you're doing
[01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:25.060]  some kind of data modeling
[01:59:25.060 --> 01:59:27.020]  or some kind of scientific computing
[01:59:27.020 --> 01:59:30.580]  where you've got this, you know,
[01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:35.500]  literally 200 gigabyte data model
[01:59:35.500 --> 01:59:36.700]  that you wanna put in memory,
[01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:40.100]  sure, that just goes off to that RAM,
[01:59:40.100 --> 01:59:42.140]  and you can keep it there,
[01:59:42.140 --> 01:59:43.660]  but, you know, I don't know,
[01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:45.900]  I just feel like if they're gonna go up to that high,
[01:59:45.900 --> 01:59:47.660]  they're not gonna, they're not gonna,
[01:59:47.660 --> 01:59:49.540]  there would be too many SKUs, right?
[01:59:49.540 --> 01:59:51.700]  Like, you're gonna buy what?
[01:59:51.700 --> 01:59:55.460]  64 gigabyte Mac Pro or 128 or 256?
[01:59:55.460 --> 01:59:56.500]  You're gonna get a 512?
[01:59:56.500 --> 01:59:57.820]  You're gonna get a 768?
[01:59:57.820 --> 02:00:00.060]  No, it's too many.
[02:00:00.060 --> 02:00:02.500]  768, man, I haven't heard that.
[02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:04.460]  I haven't heard that number in a long time.
[02:00:05.820 --> 02:00:06.660]  I think that's the right number.
[02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:07.500]  The good old days.
[02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:10.540]  Yeah, no, I mean, yeah, it was the fractional RAM days.
[02:00:12.140 --> 02:00:12.980]  You know you're a nerd
[02:00:12.980 --> 02:00:14.300]  when you think that's an even number.
[02:00:14.300 --> 02:00:16.540]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:00:16.540 --> 02:00:18.700]  You're like, ah, that number feels comfortable.
[02:00:18.700 --> 02:00:19.780]  You're like, why?
[02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:22.220]  Why would it feel comfortable?
[02:00:22.220 --> 02:00:27.180]  Anyway, thank you so much.
[02:00:27.180 --> 02:00:28.740]  Have a good holiday season, Matthew.
[02:00:28.740 --> 02:00:29.580]  Thank you, you too.
[02:00:29.580 --> 02:00:30.420]  It's always good to talk to you.
[02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:31.260]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:33.660]  Anything else?
[02:00:33.660 --> 02:00:35.180]  Everybody can read your fine work
[02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:37.380]  and the work of your fine staff at TechCrunch.
[02:00:37.380 --> 02:00:39.340]  You guys are still kicking ass over there.
[02:00:39.340 --> 02:00:40.700]  Thank you kindly.
[02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:41.540]  Making an attempt.
[02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:46.180]  And then on the Twitter, you're at Panzer, P-A-N-Z-E-R,
[02:00:47.300 --> 02:00:49.220]  which endlessly frustrates my ability
[02:00:49.220 --> 02:00:50.460]  to communicate with you.
[02:00:50.460 --> 02:00:54.580]  So I start typing this shortcut, P-A-N-Z-E,
[02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:56.380]  and it's like, no, that's not right, it's A.
[02:00:56.380 --> 02:00:57.220]  But anyway.
[02:00:58.220 --> 02:01:00.020]  And thanks to our sponsors.
[02:01:00.020 --> 02:01:02.780]  We had Away, where you can buy a suitcase.
[02:01:02.780 --> 02:01:05.260]  We had Collide, where they want you to read
[02:01:05.260 --> 02:01:08.940]  their honest security report at honest.security.
[02:01:08.940 --> 02:01:10.980]  And Mack Weldon, where you can go
[02:01:10.980 --> 02:01:14.660]  and buy amazing menswear, underwear,
[02:01:14.660 --> 02:01:17.540]  jet hoodies, slippers, anything you want.
[02:01:17.540 --> 02:01:18.380]  My thanks to them.
[02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:19.420]  All right.
[02:01:19.420 --> 02:01:20.260]  Adios, Matthew.
[02:01:20.260 --> 02:01:21.100]  Thank you very much, sir.
[02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:50.100]  Appreciate it.
