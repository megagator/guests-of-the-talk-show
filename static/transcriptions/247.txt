[00:00.000 --> 00:07.900]  Hey, everybody. John here. A little preface to the show. Big dummy that I am. I sort of
[00:07.900 --> 00:13.260]  botched the audio on my end of the show. So what you're about to hear is a little less
[00:13.260 --> 00:17.700]  audio quality than you're used to. And I'm very, very sorry about that. There is no need
[00:17.700 --> 00:24.860]  to tell me. I am fully aware of what I did, and fully aware of the irony that my guest
[00:24.860 --> 00:30.240]  on the show, Paul Kefasis, runs a software company whose software probably, if I'd used
[00:30.240 --> 00:35.220]  it to record instead of what I did, probably would have helped me avoid the mistake. So
[00:35.220 --> 00:39.320]  enjoy the show. Sorry about the audio quality. Won't happen again.
[00:39.320 --> 00:46.000]  Paul, I just saw you a couple weeks ago. It's always good to say.
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.560]  I also saw you.
[00:48.560 --> 01:01.000]  We were cavorting in Las Vegas, beautiful Las Vegas, Nevada. It's interesting. You're
[01:01.000 --> 01:06.800]  up in the Boston area, Philadelphia. The Wynn Corporation, I believe that's the name. What's
[01:06.800 --> 01:08.200]  the name of the holding company?
[01:08.200 --> 01:11.120]  It's Wynn something, yeah.
[01:11.120 --> 01:21.680]  To date, it has a casino resort in Las Vegas, and then they have two in Macau over there
[01:21.680 --> 01:28.400]  in China. And then they were going to add a new one in North America, and it's going
[01:28.400 --> 01:32.560]  to be here in Philadelphia. And they had wonderful plans.
[01:32.560 --> 01:34.920]  How did that work out, though?
[01:34.920 --> 01:42.960]  Well, the city of Philadelphia decided to... I swear to God, it came down to... The plans
[01:42.960 --> 01:47.440]  were super extensive, and I thought it was really, really wonderful. I really thought
[01:47.440 --> 01:53.200]  it was a very interesting plan here in Philadelphia. And then the city of Philadelphia, and I swear,
[01:53.200 --> 01:58.320]  it came down to traffic lights. The city of Philadelphia was like, well, we're not going
[01:58.320 --> 02:02.720]  to pay to have a turnaround here. You're going to pay, and you're going to do this, and you're
[02:02.720 --> 02:06.360]  going to do that. And the Wynn company was like, you know what we're going to do? We're
[02:06.360 --> 02:12.520]  going to go to Boston. So they're on the cusp of opening, right?
[02:12.520 --> 02:15.520]  I think, what is it? Three months from tomorrow.
[02:15.520 --> 02:19.520]  All right. So they started booking... What's it called?
[02:19.520 --> 02:24.840]  Called the Encore, which is a weird name for the first location.
[02:24.840 --> 02:28.140]  Right.
[02:28.140 --> 02:29.680]  Should we touch on it? I mean...
[02:29.680 --> 02:31.920]  Yeah, we should touch on it. I think we should.
[02:31.920 --> 02:35.200]  This resort in Las Vegas was originally the Wynn. Then they built the second one. They
[02:35.200 --> 02:40.880]  built the Encore. And it's all named after a guy named Steve Wynn, who, his real name
[02:40.880 --> 02:47.200]  is Steve Weinberg. So he changed his name to something very good for a casino owner.
[02:47.200 --> 02:51.560]  I didn't know that until very late. I thought that he was just fortuitously named.
[02:51.560 --> 02:55.600]  Steve Wynn. But turns out...
[02:55.600 --> 02:59.720]  I hate to say it, but Trump is a good name for a casino owner as well.
[02:59.720 --> 03:06.160]  But again, it was not really the family name, right? They changed it too, although a couple
[03:06.160 --> 03:07.160]  generations ago.
[03:07.160 --> 03:09.960]  Right. Who was it? John Oliver went into... What was it?
[03:09.960 --> 03:10.960]  Drumpf.
[03:10.960 --> 03:11.960]  Drumpf.
[03:11.960 --> 03:12.960]  Yeah.
[03:12.960 --> 03:16.280]  A much worse name.
[03:16.280 --> 03:20.000]  But much more predictive of how well his casinos would do.
[03:20.000 --> 03:28.040]  Very true. But yeah, so Steve Wynn starts these casinos. Turns out, Steve Wynn, terrible
[03:28.040 --> 03:30.000]  sex pervert.
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  Terrible.
[03:32.000 --> 03:33.000]  Just awful.
[03:33.000 --> 03:39.240]  They're planning to open this location in Boston and they say, you know what? Maybe
[03:39.240 --> 03:47.040]  we take his name off of it. And so now I'm literally looking out my window at the Encore
[03:47.040 --> 03:53.600]  that is about, as the crow flies, I think about four miles from my house. So it's very
[03:53.600 --> 03:57.560]  strange to see, as we were discussing when we were in Las Vegas, the design of the building
[03:57.560 --> 04:05.560]  is exactly the same. So I flew out of Boston, flew over this building. Six hours later,
[04:05.560 --> 04:11.320]  I landed in Las Vegas and drove to the exact same building.
[04:11.320 --> 04:18.800]  Part of the brand of the Wynn company is they have a certain architectural style. I think
[04:18.800 --> 04:25.560]  the two in Macau, I get confused. I've never been there. But there's the Wynn Palace and
[04:25.560 --> 04:27.320]  I think the other one's just called Wynn Macau.
[04:27.320 --> 04:30.120]  That's right. I think that's right.
[04:30.120 --> 04:37.320]  But they all have a very distinctive architectural style and colors. So the picture you took
[04:37.320 --> 04:39.160]  of the Encore Boston Harbor-
[04:39.160 --> 04:41.080]  From the airplane.
[04:41.080 --> 04:46.840]  Right. It really looked like a Photoshop job. It really looked like you went full Darth
[04:46.840 --> 04:47.840]  and-
[04:47.840 --> 04:49.640]  Just dropped the building in there.
[04:49.640 --> 04:56.720]  Well, just spent the entire four and a half hour flight painstakingly Photoshopping the
[04:56.720 --> 05:01.840]  Encore Las Vegas into the middle of Boston.
[05:01.840 --> 05:03.840]  Covered in snow. Exactly.
[05:03.840 --> 05:11.120]  Covered in snow. It's something to see. I'm looking forward to it. I'm always looking
[05:11.120 --> 05:16.160]  for an excuse to go up to Boston. It's my favorite baseball team.
[05:16.160 --> 05:20.320]  Absolutely. You're a big fan. Big fan.
[05:20.320 --> 05:24.440]  So we could go up there and maybe catch a ball game or something like that. But now
[05:24.440 --> 05:33.000]  there'll be gambling and all sorts of other stuff you can do at a casino. It is funny
[05:33.000 --> 05:38.480]  because we were just in Vegas. So yeah, Steve Wynn, terrible sex pervert, it turns out.
[05:38.480 --> 05:40.480]  Really a predator, maybe.
[05:40.480 --> 05:45.560]  Never convicted of anything, but had all sorts of all sorts of payoffs for truly heinous
[05:45.560 --> 05:50.560]  things that I'm glad the name's not on there. I'll say that.
[05:50.560 --> 06:00.480]  Yeah, it's just awful stuff. But the company has been forced out. He was the CEO, he was
[06:00.480 --> 06:05.280]  the president, he was the largest shareholder, and now he's none of the above. He resigned
[06:05.280 --> 06:12.440]  as the CEO, he resigned from the board, and then he sold all of his shares in the company.
[06:12.440 --> 06:23.000]  He doesn't even own it anymore. But the company wasn't really done at that point. They needed
[06:23.000 --> 06:34.800]  to de-Steve the complex because he's very fond of his own picture and his own voice
[06:34.800 --> 06:36.680]  famously.
[06:36.680 --> 06:41.400]  When you used to go to the website, just loading the website, you'd suddenly be hearing from
[06:41.400 --> 06:44.080]  Steve Wynn.
[06:44.080 --> 06:49.780]  Which very late, up until like two years ago, you would go to the Wynn Las Vegas website
[06:49.780 --> 06:54.280]  and as soon as it finished loading, you would hear him talking.
[06:54.280 --> 07:01.200]  Hi, I'm Steve Wynn and welcome to the website. We've got easy navigation. It's fast and it's
[07:01.200 --> 07:05.480]  convenient and we're glad you're here. Enjoy.
[07:05.480 --> 07:13.440]  Which was a very 1996, 1997 sort of thing to do. When the web first really took off,
[07:13.440 --> 07:16.920]  a lot of companies didn't really know what to do.
[07:16.920 --> 07:18.680]  How a website should work.
[07:18.680 --> 07:25.800]  Right. How much TV should it be? So a lot of them thought, well, this is ridiculous.
[07:25.800 --> 07:30.080]  You're looking at a screen, that's TV. We should talk to the people.
[07:30.080 --> 07:35.400]  And it turns out, no.
[07:35.400 --> 07:39.960]  We've had this discussion privately before, but you just know that there was some sort
[07:39.960 --> 07:46.400]  of meeting with the website team and Steve Wynn was like, well, I think I should talk
[07:46.400 --> 07:51.400]  to these people. I should let them know where they are, let them know they're at the Wynn
[07:51.400 --> 07:52.400]  website.
[07:52.400 --> 07:56.440]  And you just know that there were people on that web team who tried to talk him out of
[07:56.440 --> 07:57.440]  it.
[07:57.440 --> 07:58.440]  Unsuccessfully.
[07:58.440 --> 08:06.280]  And obviously unsuccessfully. So I'm sure that was an easy fix. They just deleted that
[08:06.280 --> 08:14.560]  audio file. I'm sure that was very satisfying for somebody. But there were all sorts of
[08:14.560 --> 08:19.480]  bits of Steve Wynn all throughout the complex. There's a restaurant in Las Vegas, Sinatra
[08:19.480 --> 08:27.240]  named it's in conjunction with the Frank Sinatra family. Pictures of Frank Sinatra with Steve
[08:27.240 --> 08:34.960]  Wynn throughout the years. They worked together when Steve Wynn owned the Golden Nugget in
[08:34.960 --> 08:41.840]  Atlantic City in the late 70s, early 80s. All sorts of pictures of him. Those pictures
[08:41.840 --> 08:42.840]  no longer there.
[08:42.840 --> 08:46.760]  They're gone. They're in a closet somewhere with, as your wife Amy likes to say, that's
[08:46.760 --> 08:52.680]  where the Joe Paterno statue is. Maybe the Smithsonian's Cosby sweaters. I'm sure they
[08:52.680 --> 08:56.040]  had some of those and those are stashed away somewhere now too.
[08:56.040 --> 09:01.960]  I didn't think about that, but I'm sure you're right that the Smithsonian surely did have
[09:01.960 --> 09:08.960]  that. Disney used to have it. Disney World, they had like a TV hall of fame, sort of busts
[09:08.960 --> 09:14.720]  of famous TV people. And step one, they took away Cosby. And then step two, they just got
[09:14.720 --> 09:16.220]  rid of the whole thing.
[09:16.220 --> 09:17.520]  The whole attraction is gone.
[09:17.520 --> 09:21.960]  Yeah. I think they got worried that maybe Betty White maybe had some skeletons in her
[09:21.960 --> 09:26.520]  closet as well. They're like, we got to get rid of all of these. Who knows what Betty
[09:26.520 --> 09:27.520]  White did.
[09:27.520 --> 09:31.360]  That's your pick for the next one is Betty White. Come on. She is a treasure.
[09:31.360 --> 09:38.120]  I think she was a predator. I'm not lodging any accusations. I'm just saying I wouldn't
[09:38.120 --> 09:45.920]  bet against it. But anyway, they've completely de-steved the entire Wynn complex other than
[09:45.920 --> 09:48.440]  the fact that it is still called the Wynn.
[09:48.440 --> 09:57.480]  Well, but as we've noted, his ex-wife, Elaine Wynn, who took his name and then kept it,
[09:57.480 --> 10:00.800]  is now the majority shareholder of the company, right?
[10:00.800 --> 10:04.960]  Right. That is true. Well, not majority, I don't think. I think she's just the largest
[10:04.960 --> 10:10.080]  shareholder. I don't think she owns more than 50%, but she is the single largest shareholder
[10:10.080 --> 10:11.200]  in the company.
[10:11.200 --> 10:15.600]  And her last name is also Wynn, although maybe she also wants to change that at this point.
[10:15.600 --> 10:16.600]  I don't know.
[10:16.600 --> 10:25.320]  Yeah. It's sort of like, I think that they're going to just turn him into a Colonel Sanders
[10:25.320 --> 10:31.360]  type figure. Yeah, he was a real guy, but I feel like after Steve Wynn dies, maybe they'll
[10:31.360 --> 10:39.600]  bring him back as sort of like a cartoon mascot and he'll be a lovable non-presitory.
[10:39.600 --> 10:46.840]  I would bet against that. I don't think there's any fix in this thing.
[10:46.840 --> 10:48.980]  Although Colonel Sanders is still around.
[10:48.980 --> 10:52.480]  As like 15 different mascots right now, right?
[10:52.480 --> 10:57.360]  Yeah. Did you ever hear the story, you ever read the story where a New York Times food
[10:57.360 --> 11:07.160]  critic sometime around 1977 or so took the actual Colonel Sanders into a KFC in Midtown
[11:07.160 --> 11:08.160]  New York?
[11:08.160 --> 11:09.160]  Oh boy.
[11:09.160 --> 11:18.080]  And this was after he sold his chain to a nationwide company at some point, 15 years
[11:18.080 --> 11:20.080]  before or so.
[11:20.080 --> 11:27.000]  So he hadn't really been in direct.
[11:27.000 --> 11:30.240]  He was a spokesperson, but he really wasn't involved with the restaurants.
[11:30.240 --> 11:37.660]  And so she took him in and they went back to the kitchen and he was horrified and read
[11:37.660 --> 11:42.080]  everybody the riot act about how they were doing everything wrong.
[11:42.080 --> 11:48.240]  And it's pretty, I should see if I can find that, but it's a good story.
[11:48.240 --> 11:53.320]  In his later years, he became highly critical of the food served by KFC restaurants as he
[11:53.320 --> 11:56.160]  believed they had cut costs and allowed quality to deteriorate.
[11:56.160 --> 11:57.560]  Yeah, there you go.
[11:57.560 --> 12:01.920]  Yeah, it was all like cost cutting and any, you know, like the mashed potatoes aren't
[12:01.920 --> 12:02.920]  really mashed potatoes.
[12:02.920 --> 12:07.160]  They're, you know, some kind of chemical recreation of mashed potatoes and he's like potato flakes
[12:07.160 --> 12:12.120]  and how the hell can you not, you just boil potatoes in there, mash them up.
[12:12.120 --> 12:17.000]  Like this is not, you know, not tricky food.
[12:17.000 --> 12:22.120]  Anyway, anyway, Wynn Boston Harbor, not Wynn, Encore Boston Harbor.
[12:22.120 --> 12:23.120]  Encore Boston Harbor.
[12:23.120 --> 12:24.120]  Yeah.
[12:24.120 --> 12:27.720]  Well, so there's two, there's two things to this name because it was when they were, when
[12:27.720 --> 12:32.540]  they were applying for this and trying to make it happen, it was the Wynn Boston Harbor.
[12:32.540 --> 12:34.600]  And now they, then they scrubbed his name from it.
[12:34.600 --> 12:42.360]  It's the Encore Boston Harbor, but the Boston Harbor aspect of it is also fallacious because
[12:42.360 --> 12:45.560]  if you, I don't know, I don't know, maybe you throw a map in the, in the show notes
[12:45.560 --> 12:50.680]  or something, but, uh, I can, I'm sitting in Boston right now and I can see this, but
[12:50.680 --> 12:56.120]  the actual property is in a town called Everett, which is just over the line from Boston.
[12:56.120 --> 13:02.240]  And the waterfront that it will be on is the Mystic River, which feeds into Boston Harbor,
[13:02.240 --> 13:06.600]  again, about four miles down the road, down the, down the stream.
[13:06.600 --> 13:13.480]  So I get why they didn't go with the Encore Everett, but they're definitely playing a
[13:13.480 --> 13:15.760]  little fast and loose with the name here.
[13:15.760 --> 13:16.760]  Yeah.
[13:16.760 --> 13:21.680]  I wonder, uh, Philly's was going to be in the city proper.
[13:21.680 --> 13:24.400]  Uh, it was going to be right, right in the city city.
[13:24.400 --> 13:29.780]  It, I don't want to go on a super long tangent about it, but it, Philly has a weird thing
[13:29.780 --> 13:32.080]  where, where we've got two rivers.
[13:32.080 --> 13:40.240]  We've got the Schuylkill River, which most people can't spell S C H U Y L K I L L. Uh,
[13:40.240 --> 13:41.360]  the kill part is easy.
[13:41.360 --> 13:42.360]  Uh, yeah.
[13:42.360 --> 13:46.280]  Once you get past the school right now, it runs right through the middle of the city
[13:46.280 --> 13:50.080]  and it divides it into, you know, Drexel and Penn are on the one side of the river and
[13:50.080 --> 13:52.600]  then center city, Philadelphia is on the other side.
[13:52.600 --> 13:58.480]  And then we've got the, uh, the Delaware river, which is the border between Pennsylvania and
[13:58.480 --> 14:04.720]  New Jersey and it's, it's a big, much bigger, wider river to very wide river.
[14:04.720 --> 14:10.560]  Um, for whatever reason, most cities, riverfront property is, is prestigious.
[14:10.560 --> 14:14.960]  It's expensive real estate, you know, that's the people want to live on the water.
[14:14.960 --> 14:24.080]  Um, and Philly, we, we have I 95 running right along the Delaware.
[14:24.080 --> 14:31.720]  It's it's giant super highway running right down where, where it, by most logic should
[14:31.720 --> 14:35.200]  be the, you know, some of the best real estate in the city, billions of dollars worth of
[14:35.200 --> 14:39.000]  real estate and, and it's just weird.
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.760]  And then, you know, the land, it's just underused and that's where when was going to put their,
[14:43.760 --> 14:45.960]  their, uh, casino resort.
[14:45.960 --> 14:50.360]  And uh, they had a really nice plan where they, uh, parking is always an issue with
[14:50.360 --> 14:54.060]  the casino because people drive to the casino and then they've got all these cars and park
[14:54.060 --> 14:55.120]  and garages are ugly.
[14:55.120 --> 14:58.280]  So they had a really nice plan where they were going to put the whole parking garage
[14:58.280 --> 14:59.280]  underground.
[14:59.280 --> 15:00.860]  Everything was going to be underground.
[15:00.860 --> 15:06.120]  And then on the top of it about, you know, about one story up, they were going to build,
[15:06.120 --> 15:08.760]  uh, just put grass and make it a nice public park.
[15:08.760 --> 15:11.400]  It would, you know, it wouldn't be like you'd have to pay or anything.
[15:11.400 --> 15:16.200]  It was going to be a public park right along the river, right next to the casino.
[15:16.200 --> 15:21.780]  Uh, you know, just as, as a, a nice thing for the city here, we're going to build this
[15:21.780 --> 15:22.780]  big casino.
[15:22.780 --> 15:25.760]  Uh, we're going to have all these fancy restaurants and all this stuff.
[15:25.760 --> 15:28.900]  We'll, we'll put all the cars underground and then on top of it, we'll have a nice little
[15:28.900 --> 15:34.740]  park where anybody can come, uh, seemed very nice instead.
[15:34.740 --> 15:36.900]  And you guys screwed up the whole thing.
[15:36.900 --> 15:40.640]  We got bubbles, got absolutely nothing.
[15:40.640 --> 15:41.640]  We got the sugar house.
[15:41.640 --> 15:42.640]  Well, it's funny.
[15:42.640 --> 15:48.680]  I was looking at the, the, when Massachusetts legalized casino gambling, I think they take
[15:48.680 --> 15:53.080]  a 25% cut right off the top, uh, in taxes.
[15:53.080 --> 15:57.720]  So it's a huge amount of money going to the state, which is why they're interested in
[15:57.720 --> 15:59.080]  doing this.
[15:59.080 --> 16:04.600]  And I was looking at the estimates and because they're going to have an impact on multiple
[16:04.600 --> 16:07.780]  cities, they have to pay surrounding community agreements.
[16:07.780 --> 16:11.680]  And the city of Boston is going to get something like 50 million over 15 years.
[16:11.680 --> 16:14.560]  So, you know, three or 4 million a year, something like that.
[16:14.560 --> 16:19.300]  Uh, the city of Everett, which is, I'd have to look, but it's a city of under a hundred
[16:19.300 --> 16:20.300]  thousand people.
[16:20.300 --> 16:26.120]  I think is going to make 472 million over that first 15 years.
[16:26.120 --> 16:28.640]  That's the estimate at least.
[16:28.640 --> 16:29.640]  Holy crap.
[16:29.640 --> 16:33.640]  Uh, and, and you know, this is a, like I said, it's a small city that, that this is going
[16:33.640 --> 16:37.720]  to like, it's going to be like 20% of their annual budget.
[16:37.720 --> 16:40.680]  They're going to get every year just from one casino being there.
[16:40.680 --> 16:42.960]  Oh my God, it's crazy.
[16:42.960 --> 16:43.960]  So yeah, I don't know.
[16:43.960 --> 16:47.160]  I think, I think Philly blew it.
[16:47.160 --> 16:48.160]  I would say so.
[16:48.160 --> 16:53.800]  46,000 is the population and they're going to get something like 32 million a year out
[16:53.800 --> 16:59.920]  of just having this casino be on the edge of their, their city.
[16:59.920 --> 17:01.280]  That's absolutely crazy.
[17:01.280 --> 17:02.280]  Yeah.
[17:02.280 --> 17:04.000]  And Philly really was going to have it right in the city.
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.020]  So we've got one, I think we've only got one that's officially in city limits.
[17:07.020 --> 17:08.320]  That's the sugar house I mentioned.
[17:08.320 --> 17:09.320]  Terrible name.
[17:09.320 --> 17:11.320]  Which is a terrible name.
[17:11.320 --> 17:12.600]  It is a terrible casino.
[17:12.600 --> 17:18.680]  I, although I will say I haven't been there in several years cause it's so miserable.
[17:18.680 --> 17:21.480]  So you think maybe it got slightly less miserable?
[17:21.480 --> 17:26.640]  I've, I forget if I've even talked about this before, but Amy and I went, I think twice
[17:26.640 --> 17:32.000]  and uh, the one time we went, it was the winter and everybody's, everybody had their code
[17:32.000 --> 17:33.000]  check.
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.880]  They don't have a code check?
[17:35.880 --> 17:41.080]  Well, I guess they did and, and Amy and I, maybe everybody was thinking the same thing
[17:41.080 --> 17:45.120]  we were where Amy and I didn't check our coats because we're like, I don't think we're going
[17:45.120 --> 17:46.120]  to stay here.
[17:46.120 --> 17:47.120]  Yeah.
[17:47.120 --> 17:52.480]  But like even people who seem to be settled in playing games and et cetera, we're all
[17:52.480 --> 17:54.320]  wearing their coats.
[17:54.320 --> 18:00.120]  It's just, I just seemed weird and it, you know, it, it throws you off.
[18:00.120 --> 18:01.120]  I don't know.
[18:01.120 --> 18:06.200]  I mean, you know, Atlantic city has pretty much identical climate to Philadelphia and
[18:06.200 --> 18:08.520]  they've had casinos for an entire generation.
[18:08.520 --> 18:12.280]  I don't remember this problem, you know, the times I've been to an Atlantic city casino
[18:12.280 --> 18:15.200]  of, of all the, where do you put your coat?
[18:15.200 --> 18:16.880]  But it does seem like a weird problem.
[18:16.880 --> 18:17.880]  Yeah.
[18:17.880 --> 18:21.320]  Coats and casinos just don't seem to go well together like an outdoor jacket.
[18:21.320 --> 18:24.000]  And again, maybe they have fixed it.
[18:24.000 --> 18:27.720]  Maybe I don't, I haven't been there in years, but the problem with sugar house was when
[18:27.720 --> 18:33.720]  the Pennsylvania state legislature legalized gambling, they only legalized a slot machines
[18:33.720 --> 18:38.420]  and the assorted, you know, whatever video poker, you know,
[18:38.420 --> 18:39.420]  No table games.
[18:39.420 --> 18:40.420]  Yeah.
[18:40.420 --> 18:42.920]  No table games.
[18:42.920 --> 18:46.600]  And which seems stupid to me, a, because I don't like to play slot machines.
[18:46.600 --> 18:50.000]  I like to play table games and B what sense does that make?
[18:50.000 --> 18:53.680]  You know, if you're going to have, you know, I, I see the argument not to have gambling
[18:53.680 --> 18:54.680]  at all.
[18:54.680 --> 18:59.880]  I don't see the argument of, you know, you can have slot machines, but you can't have
[18:59.880 --> 19:00.880]  table games.
[19:00.880 --> 19:03.120]  It seems to me like if anything, you should do it the other way.
[19:03.120 --> 19:07.440]  Slot machines are the ones that seem more addictive and people sort of zone out and,
[19:07.440 --> 19:11.440]  you know, maybe play too much.
[19:11.440 --> 19:16.760]  But anyway, before they opened, the Pennsylvania state legislature came to a census.
[19:16.760 --> 19:18.560]  Somebody more or less said exactly what I did.
[19:18.560 --> 19:19.560]  This doesn't make any sense.
[19:19.560 --> 19:21.040]  Why don't we have table games too?
[19:21.040 --> 19:22.040]  And they're like, okay.
[19:22.040 --> 19:24.120]  And then they said, okay, we can have table games.
[19:24.120 --> 19:26.880]  But the sugar house had already been, it was already under construction.
[19:26.880 --> 19:28.640]  So they had to tack this on?
[19:28.640 --> 19:29.640]  Yeah.
[19:29.640 --> 19:34.320]  They had a floor plan that was entirely based on the idea that they'd only have, the only
[19:34.320 --> 19:39.040]  gambling would be, uh, uh, slot machines and et cetera.
[19:39.040 --> 19:44.420]  And so they just put the table games like blackjack and roulette and craps.
[19:44.420 --> 19:50.040]  They just put them in what clearly were going to be the aisles between the table game, between
[19:50.040 --> 19:51.340]  the slot machines.
[19:51.340 --> 19:55.600]  And so you literally, like I played some blackjack and like the back of your chair was right
[19:55.600 --> 19:56.840]  off against slot machines.
[19:56.840 --> 19:59.600]  It was very strange.
[19:59.600 --> 20:02.280]  And then there was nowhere really to walk around.
[20:02.280 --> 20:04.120]  It was extremely crowded.
[20:04.120 --> 20:05.120]  And it was a brand new casino.
[20:05.120 --> 20:09.640]  It was, you know, the whole thing was built from the ground and everyone's bulked up with
[20:09.640 --> 20:11.640]  their winter jackets.
[20:11.640 --> 20:15.760]  Everybody had puffy coats.
[20:15.760 --> 20:18.720]  I saw a guy, I remember this when Amy and I were there and we're like, well, let's have
[20:18.720 --> 20:22.400]  one drink and then we'll, we'll hit the road, you know, let's get out of here.
[20:22.400 --> 20:27.440]  Um, so we went over to a bar and you know how in a casino, uh, a lot of times the bars
[20:27.440 --> 20:29.960]  will have video poker built right into the bar.
[20:29.960 --> 20:30.960]  Sure.
[20:30.960 --> 20:32.520]  They got to keep taking as much of your money as possible.
[20:32.520 --> 20:33.520]  Yeah.
[20:33.520 --> 20:35.120]  And it wasn't crowded.
[20:35.120 --> 20:39.240]  And so Amy and I sat down and there was a guy, it was a guy to my left and I looked
[20:39.240 --> 20:45.200]  over and he had like, uh, I wasn't trying to rubberneck, you know, I feel like that's
[20:45.200 --> 20:47.560]  rude, but I, you know, I looked to see what he was playing.
[20:47.560 --> 20:52.120]  He was playing video poker and he had like 4,000 credits and I was like, holy crap, man.
[20:52.120 --> 20:53.120]  I was like, what the hell is that?
[20:53.120 --> 20:59.720]  And I was like, I think those are quarters, but that's, you know, and he was right next
[20:59.720 --> 21:00.720]  to me.
[21:00.720 --> 21:02.080]  So I wanted to be discreet about it.
[21:02.080 --> 21:04.800]  And I wanted to get Amy's attention and say, Hey, this guy's got like a thousand bucks
[21:04.800 --> 21:05.800]  on this thing.
[21:05.800 --> 21:08.200]  And, and, but I didn't really have an opportunity to talk.
[21:08.200 --> 21:12.440]  And then I look over again and it said 6,000 and I was like, holy crap.
[21:12.440 --> 21:14.280]  And then it was 8,500.
[21:14.280 --> 21:17.000]  So I was like, holy shit, this guy's making a mint.
[21:17.000 --> 21:20.640]  And by the time I got Amy's attention, it was back down to like a thousand.
[21:20.640 --> 21:27.760]  So, so this guy, this guy in like the course of like 10 minutes had won like over a thousand
[21:27.760 --> 21:32.960]  dollars in video poker and then lost close to 2000.
[21:32.960 --> 21:33.960]  And you would never know it.
[21:33.960 --> 21:36.760]  You'd never know he was playing from what you would think he was playing for like five
[21:36.760 --> 21:37.760]  bucks or something.
[21:37.760 --> 21:43.920]  It was just, just total robot, you know, just hit the buttons, but playing super fast.
[21:43.920 --> 21:47.280]  So you're saying this casino is going to be a great thing here in Boston.
[21:47.280 --> 21:51.320]  It's going to go well for everybody.
[21:51.320 --> 21:54.720]  I see no problems stemming from this.
[21:54.720 --> 22:01.840]  I don't know, dude, you're not really a gambler, are you know, I, I, I think we've talked about
[22:01.840 --> 22:02.840]  this a little bit.
[22:02.840 --> 22:06.200]  Any, any money that I would win gambling would be okay.
[22:06.200 --> 22:07.200]  That's nice.
[22:07.200 --> 22:11.920]  And any money that I would lose gambling, I would think, what the hell did I just do?
[22:11.920 --> 22:12.920]  You're too sensible.
[22:12.920 --> 22:13.920]  That's yeah.
[22:13.920 --> 22:17.000]  The, the upshot is so minimal compared to the downside for me.
[22:17.000 --> 22:18.000]  So right.
[22:18.000 --> 22:19.000]  Right.
[22:19.000 --> 22:27.320]  It, yeah, I'm, I'm like, uh, evil polka, like, like I think we, we both have equal understanding
[22:27.320 --> 22:33.840]  of the mathematics and how, how, how screwed you are ultimately playing any of these games.
[22:33.840 --> 22:40.120]  And I can completely disassociate and enjoy it from the math.
[22:40.120 --> 22:46.520]  And I feel, I, I, I don't believe it, you know, like right now talking to you in, in
[22:46.520 --> 22:54.240]  the light of day, uh, I know it's not true, but while I'm playing, I feel like I get what
[22:54.240 --> 22:55.240]  I deserve.
[22:55.240 --> 22:59.600]  I feel like there are blackjack gods and, and if I've, I've been a good boy, I get good
[22:59.600 --> 23:00.600]  cards.
[23:00.600 --> 23:05.960]  And if, if I've done, done the universe wrong, karma comes and gets me and I get a bunch
[23:05.960 --> 23:06.960]  of 16.
[23:06.960 --> 23:10.480]  Do you believe in karma anywhere else or only at the blackjack table?
[23:10.480 --> 23:12.840]  Only at, only at, well, and craps.
[23:12.840 --> 23:13.840]  Sure, sure.
[23:13.840 --> 23:14.840]  Yeah.
[23:14.840 --> 23:21.280]  Well, actually, uh, let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor, the Encore Boston
[23:21.280 --> 23:22.280]  Harbor.

[26:12.120 --> 26:16.880]  What do you want to talk about today, Paul?
[26:16.880 --> 26:18.360]  Anything but technology.
[26:18.360 --> 26:22.200]  Oh, it's so funny cause I actually had like an Apple store.
[26:22.200 --> 26:24.760]  Oh, well go ahead.
[26:24.760 --> 26:29.320]  Guess who's the jackass who washed our iPods two days before the new ones come out.
[26:29.320 --> 26:30.360]  Wait, isn't it?
[26:30.360 --> 26:33.440]  You washed your little case with the AirPods in it.
[26:33.440 --> 26:34.880]  The AirPods, iPods, whatever.
[26:34.880 --> 26:35.880]  And they're dead?
[26:35.880 --> 26:36.880]  Well, one.
[26:36.880 --> 26:41.020]  One is dead and one sounds a little squishy.
[26:41.020 --> 26:42.080]  So wait, isn't that perfect?
[26:42.080 --> 26:47.480]  I mean, maybe you didn't have an excuse to update before and now, well, whoops.
[26:47.480 --> 26:53.880]  Yeah, but now I'm like, I'm without iPods and I'm walking around and it's so funny because
[26:53.880 --> 26:58.760]  when they first came out, um, you thought everyone looks stupid.
[26:58.760 --> 27:01.360]  You know, these little things dangling from your ears.
[27:01.360 --> 27:03.120]  People with cords look so dumb.
[27:03.120 --> 27:04.120]  I feel like an idiot.
[27:04.120 --> 27:08.240]  Oh, you're walking around all corded, all tethered to your, to your whatever.
[27:08.240 --> 27:09.240]  Yeah.
[27:09.240 --> 27:12.920]  I'm all walking away from things and forgetting to grab my phone.
[27:12.920 --> 27:14.240]  It's horrible.
[27:14.240 --> 27:15.240]  It's horrible.
[27:15.240 --> 27:18.440]  I, you might know a guy who could get you a new pair.
[27:18.440 --> 27:19.440]  I don't know.
[27:19.440 --> 27:21.480]  He might have a little bit of pull.
[27:21.480 --> 27:27.560]  Well, I mean, I can walk into an Apple store, same as anybody, but, uh, I need them now
[27:27.560 --> 27:32.240]  and I can't buy them now.
[27:32.240 --> 27:34.160]  I need them right now.
[27:34.160 --> 27:38.720]  I think you're, you're, you're stuck living a corded life for another week or two.
[27:38.720 --> 27:39.720]  Yeah.
[27:39.720 --> 27:41.320]  When did they come out?
[27:41.320 --> 27:42.320]  I don't know.
[27:42.320 --> 27:44.040]  They, they, they ship in next week, something.
[27:44.040 --> 27:45.040]  I don't know.
[27:45.040 --> 27:46.680]  You gotta, you might be too late now.
[27:46.680 --> 27:48.240]  It might take, might take weeks.
[27:48.240 --> 27:50.920]  You could be, you could be tethered to your phone for weeks.
[27:50.920 --> 27:53.160]  Look at us talking about Apple stuff.
[27:53.160 --> 27:56.040]  I mean, I call everything all the wrong name.
[27:56.040 --> 28:00.640]  Uh, yeah, that's pretty much all I got in terms of Apple stuff.
[28:00.640 --> 28:05.000]  I took a tumble, uh, Scarlett took a tumble.
[28:05.000 --> 28:06.000]  You took a tumble.
[28:06.000 --> 28:07.240]  Tell me more.
[28:07.240 --> 28:08.240]  I almost lost a tooth.
[28:08.240 --> 28:10.240]  Well, no, I didn't almost lose a tooth.
[28:10.240 --> 28:11.240]  I went to the dentist.
[28:11.240 --> 28:14.680]  I didn't lose a tooth, uh, just some, some damage.
[28:14.680 --> 28:16.240]  I took a tumble.
[28:16.240 --> 28:17.240]  Hold on.
[28:17.240 --> 28:18.240]  Hold on.
[28:18.240 --> 28:19.240]  It was very embarrassing.
[28:19.240 --> 28:23.480]  I took a tumble that you, your, was your next move to go to the dentist?
[28:23.480 --> 28:26.960]  No, because I thought I felt okay.
[28:26.960 --> 28:29.440]  And then my tooth started to kind of hurt.
[28:29.440 --> 28:34.240]  And then I just convinced myself that it was going to turn black and fall out.
[28:34.240 --> 28:39.040]  So I went to the dentist and they're all like talking about bruised ligaments and you know,
[28:39.040 --> 28:40.040]  that I should be fine.
[28:40.040 --> 28:43.780]  And I was like, just tell me, is my tooth going to turn black and fall out?
[28:43.780 --> 28:45.280]  And they said, most definitely not.
[28:45.280 --> 28:46.800]  And I said, let me up.
[28:46.800 --> 28:47.800]  I'm out of here.
[28:47.800 --> 28:48.800]  I'm good.
[28:48.800 --> 28:49.800]  That was all I needed.
[28:49.800 --> 28:50.800]  That was all I needed.
[28:50.800 --> 28:51.800]  All right.
[28:51.800 --> 28:52.800]  Uh, but you're okay.
[28:52.800 --> 28:53.800]  Yeah.
[28:53.800 --> 28:54.800]  I'm totally, totally fine.
[28:54.800 --> 28:55.800]  Uh, I thought I broke my nose then.
[28:55.800 --> 29:00.800]  Um, I'm a little bit of a hypochondriac, really.
[29:00.800 --> 29:07.160]  Well, wait, but a hypochondriac has like a cough and thinks they have deadly swine flu.
[29:07.160 --> 29:10.880]  You, it sounds like you smashed your face into something.
[29:10.880 --> 29:15.240]  I don't think that's, I don't know that that qualifies as being a hypochondriac.
[29:15.240 --> 29:18.360]  I have a red dot on my nose and it kind of hurts when I smile.
[29:18.360 --> 29:19.960]  So don't make me laugh.
[29:19.960 --> 29:20.960]  No problem there.
[29:20.960 --> 29:23.960]  Let's keep it somber.
[29:23.960 --> 29:25.600]  No problem there on this show.
[29:25.600 --> 29:26.600]  Should we let him play?
[29:26.600 --> 29:27.600]  Should we have a special guest on the show?
[29:27.600 --> 29:29.600]  Oh no, we have a rule.
[29:29.600 --> 29:30.600]  No guests.
[29:30.600 --> 29:31.600]  No guests.
[29:31.600 --> 29:32.600]  Sorry, John.
[29:32.600 --> 29:33.880]  When we're done, the show's over.
[29:33.880 --> 29:35.560]  So he, I hope he got all his ad reads in.
[29:35.560 --> 29:42.240]  Do you know how we had like a vow to say like, Oh, this law, you know, to not say this wall
[29:42.240 --> 29:43.840]  be cut.
[29:43.840 --> 29:45.840]  This wall.
[29:45.840 --> 29:50.120]  His show doesn't have that rule.
[29:50.120 --> 29:51.120]  Well now wait.
[29:51.120 --> 29:54.000]  So this is back to, let's, let's get it back on topic, Amy.
[29:54.000 --> 29:55.620]  Let's keep it back on track.
[29:55.620 --> 29:56.620]  Did your...
[29:56.620 --> 29:57.620]  You want to talk about my tumble?
[29:57.620 --> 30:00.520]  Do you want to talk about how I just got my glasses straightened so I don't look crazy
[30:00.520 --> 30:01.520]  anymore?
[30:01.520 --> 30:04.640]  Have you ever noticed if somebody's glasses are a little crooked, they look crazy.
[30:04.640 --> 30:05.640]  They look nuts.
[30:05.640 --> 30:06.640]  Yeah.
[30:06.640 --> 30:09.100]  I just walked in and I was like, oh, netty professor me.
[30:09.100 --> 30:13.840]  And first of all, the kid was too young to have any idea what I was talking about.
[30:13.840 --> 30:15.200]  I'm probably too young.
[30:15.200 --> 30:17.680]  I was totally going to go with Jerry Lewis on that though.
[30:17.680 --> 30:18.680]  Yeah.
[30:18.680 --> 30:20.600]  That's totally the Jerry Lewis look.
[30:20.600 --> 30:21.600]  Yeah.
[30:21.600 --> 30:24.360]  Well, this kid didn't know what I was talking about.
[30:24.360 --> 30:26.600]  He was 12.
[30:26.600 --> 30:27.600]  I mean, so yeah.
[30:27.600 --> 30:29.120]  So I got those straightened out.
[30:29.120 --> 30:30.120]  All right.
[30:30.120 --> 30:31.120]  But you're okay.
[30:31.120 --> 30:32.120]  Yeah.
[30:32.120 --> 30:33.120]  I'm totally fine.
[30:33.120 --> 30:34.120]  I'm totally fine.
[30:34.120 --> 30:35.920]  Then let's, then we don't care about this anymore.
[30:35.920 --> 30:36.920]  Your AirPods though.
[30:36.920 --> 30:37.920]  Your AirPods I'm worried about.
[30:37.920 --> 30:38.920]  Yeah.
[30:38.920 --> 30:41.320]  So am I. They're upstairs in a bag of rice.
[30:41.320 --> 30:42.960]  I'm walking around with the wires.
[30:42.960 --> 30:45.280]  Were they in their case when they went in the wash?
[30:45.280 --> 30:46.280]  Yes.
[30:46.280 --> 30:47.280]  Really?
[30:47.280 --> 30:48.280]  Yes.
[30:48.280 --> 30:49.280]  See, cause I, I
[30:49.280 --> 30:54.720]  This all relates to my tumble because the tumble took me off my game.
[30:54.720 --> 30:57.520]  Like I don't watch things with things in the pockets.
[30:57.520 --> 31:00.320]  Like I was off my game yesterday.
[31:00.320 --> 31:01.680]  I was really scared.
[31:01.680 --> 31:02.680]  I was convinced.
[31:02.680 --> 31:05.600]  Black front tooth, you know, broken nose.
[31:05.600 --> 31:07.400]  I'm just going to say this is totally false.
[31:07.400 --> 31:09.680]  She washes my pants with stuff in the pockets all
[31:09.680 --> 31:10.680]  Wait.
[31:10.680 --> 31:11.680]  That's on you.
[31:11.680 --> 31:14.240]  Her responsibility ends with her stuff.
[31:14.240 --> 31:15.240]  And maybe the boys.
[31:15.240 --> 31:16.240]  Oh yeah.
[31:16.240 --> 31:17.240]  Yeah.
[31:17.240 --> 31:18.240]  No, I don't even.
[31:18.240 --> 31:19.240]  Well, I steal their money.
[31:19.240 --> 31:23.160]  I do steal their money, but that like pops out.
[31:23.160 --> 31:26.500]  That's a true mom move to steal all the money you find in the washer.
[31:26.500 --> 31:28.160]  You got to get paid for this somehow.
[31:28.160 --> 31:29.160]  Yeah.
[31:29.160 --> 31:33.680]  But yeah, I don't check their pockets for things.
[31:33.680 --> 31:34.680]  That's on them.
[31:34.680 --> 31:35.680]  All right.
[31:35.680 --> 31:39.320]  But so you usually, you usually keep your pockets free and clear before they go in the
[31:39.320 --> 31:40.320]  wash.
[31:40.320 --> 31:41.320]  Yeah.
[31:41.320 --> 31:42.320]  Yeah.
[31:42.320 --> 31:45.560]  So it's, it all comes back to the tumble and uh, I mean it was bound to happen.
[31:45.560 --> 31:48.200]  It just happened at the absolute worst time.
[31:48.200 --> 31:53.400]  So I, I slide my AirPods into my, my little jeans, fifth pocket all the time.
[31:53.400 --> 31:55.960]  It's the only thing I've ever used that pocket for.
[31:55.960 --> 31:59.240]  And I think that's like the greatest feature that Apple has not even mentioned is that
[31:59.240 --> 32:00.800]  they fit right in there.
[32:00.800 --> 32:01.800]  But I, I'm a woman.
[32:01.800 --> 32:02.800]  We don't have pockets at all.
[32:02.800 --> 32:07.520]  That pocket is also usually fake, but it was in my gym clothes.
[32:07.520 --> 32:12.120]  I managed to wash mine in the case and I pulled them out and I said, ah, hell.
[32:12.120 --> 32:14.480]  And to my knowledge, there has been no issue.
[32:14.480 --> 32:19.360]  So I don't know, do you use, you know, they've got the gentle cycle where you on like the
[32:19.360 --> 32:20.360]  rough cycle?
[32:20.360 --> 32:21.360]  Yeah.
[32:21.360 --> 32:26.600]  My clothes are real dirty, real dirty in the pits.
[32:26.600 --> 32:33.560]  No, uh, no, I just, well, one of them, one of them works, so, you know, it's not that
[32:33.560 --> 32:34.560]  bad.
[32:34.560 --> 32:35.560]  I don't know.
[32:35.560 --> 32:36.560]  It's pretty bad.
[32:36.560 --> 32:47.040]  We've got the rice, I mean, I have faith in the rice, maybe misplaced faith in the rice.
[32:47.040 --> 32:48.760]  You should see John's set up down here.
[32:48.760 --> 32:51.080]  He's like in our basement.
[32:51.080 --> 32:52.640]  He's staring at a wall.
[32:52.640 --> 32:56.000]  This is not, I can't even tell you about his desk.
[32:56.000 --> 32:57.000]  Does he do show notes?
[32:57.000 --> 32:58.520]  Can I take a picture of this desk?
[32:58.520 --> 32:59.520]  Yes.
[32:59.520 --> 33:00.520]  What he's working with here?
[33:00.520 --> 33:01.520]  Yes.
[33:01.520 --> 33:02.520]  No.
[33:02.520 --> 33:03.520]  Yes.
[33:03.520 --> 33:04.520]  Yes you may.
[33:04.520 --> 33:05.520]  You can and you will.
[33:05.520 --> 33:07.320]  This is, this is terrible.
[33:07.320 --> 33:12.120]  And the travesty that is his disgusting desk will be shared with the world.
[33:12.120 --> 33:13.120]  This is terrible.
[33:13.120 --> 33:14.120]  Oh, and I'm looking at his computer.
[33:14.120 --> 33:18.760]  You know, he had a guy on here named Rich Mogul, what a name.
[33:18.760 --> 33:20.960]  I'm aware of Rich.
[33:20.960 --> 33:21.960]  Good dude.
[33:21.960 --> 33:22.960]  I am not.
[33:22.960 --> 33:24.520]  But a hell of a name though.
[33:24.520 --> 33:25.520]  You're right.
[33:25.520 --> 33:26.520]  Hell of a name.
[33:26.520 --> 33:29.080]  I hope it's working out for him.
[33:29.080 --> 33:33.240]  Um, well, I mean, I guess that's about all my time.
[33:33.240 --> 33:36.760]  I feel like we've done 30 minutes.
[33:36.760 --> 33:41.160]  Are we going to be able to get our theme song here?
[33:41.160 --> 33:43.080]  We can make it happen.
[33:43.080 --> 33:52.720]  Just the tip, Amy and Paul, the best darn podcast of them all.
[33:52.720 --> 34:10.280]  If only I knew a guy really good at audio.
[34:10.280 --> 34:14.840]  I might, I might be able to make it happen.
[34:14.840 --> 34:16.520]  Well now he sprung this on me too early.
[34:16.520 --> 34:19.560]  This, this is how we should have ended the show, but now I got to go back and talk his
[34:19.560 --> 34:20.560]  nonsense.
[34:20.560 --> 34:22.800]  Oh yeah, I know.
[34:22.800 --> 34:23.800]  Well you know what?
[34:23.800 --> 34:28.640]  Everyone else will be so glad that it's done.
[34:28.640 --> 34:29.640]  I don't, I don't.
[34:29.640 --> 34:33.320]  I think these people are going to complain.
[34:33.320 --> 34:34.560]  We just got a text from Audible.
[34:34.560 --> 34:37.160]  They caught, they, they called it off the whole thing's off.
[34:37.160 --> 34:42.400]  They're not paying for that ad.
[34:42.400 --> 34:45.280]  I don't remember how we used to end our show.
[34:45.280 --> 34:46.440]  Just just walk away.
[34:46.440 --> 34:48.560]  Just footstep noises walking away.
[34:48.560 --> 34:49.560]  Wait.
[34:49.560 --> 34:50.560]  Okay.
[34:50.560 --> 34:53.760]  I'm going to flip this janky desk over and walk away.
[34:53.760 --> 35:09.400]  There we go, what a delightful treat.
[35:09.400 --> 35:10.400]  It's like old days.
[35:10.400 --> 35:16.160]  It's like hanging out with you two, two weeks ago.
[35:16.160 --> 35:17.160]  We're having fun.
[35:17.160 --> 35:22.000]  We're stuck there thinking about going to play blackjack, right?
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.160]  Working on my sports.
[35:25.160 --> 35:26.160]  Who you got in the tournament?
[35:26.160 --> 35:32.440]  I got a same pick I've made for around 27 consecutive years.
[35:32.440 --> 35:35.040]  I've got the university of North Carolina going all the way.
[35:35.040 --> 35:41.280]  It's that's worked out well multiple times in the recent past, but I'm sick to my stomach
[35:41.280 --> 35:44.200]  because you know, he's going to win.
[35:44.200 --> 35:47.520]  You think it's actually going to win?
[35:47.520 --> 35:49.880]  The best thing that ever happened to Duke and I hate Duke.
[35:49.880 --> 35:54.200]  I really I've been lifelong North Carolina fan, so I hate Duke and I really don't like
[35:54.200 --> 35:58.840]  Coach K. I think he's a smug, arrogant, I just there's something about that guy that
[35:58.840 --> 35:59.840]  rubs me the wrong way.
[35:59.840 --> 36:01.200]  I don't like his black hair.
[36:01.200 --> 36:02.200]  That's fake.
[36:02.200 --> 36:03.200]  Come on.
[36:03.200 --> 36:06.920]  The guy's 70 years old and he's got a head full of black hair.
[36:06.920 --> 36:07.920]  Don't like him.
[36:07.920 --> 36:11.040]  But I'll tell you what best thing that ever happened to him that that team this year was
[36:11.040 --> 36:13.800]  Zion Williamson going down for a couple games.
[36:13.800 --> 36:16.240]  And they look bad without right.
[36:16.240 --> 36:23.520]  And then he came back and he he looks he looks like if you made like a comedy video where
[36:23.520 --> 36:28.240]  you took like an NBA star and had him play like against an eighth grade team.
[36:28.240 --> 36:32.680]  Like that is what he looks like playing against elite teams in the ACC.
[36:32.680 --> 36:35.160]  Like he came back and it was just unbelievable.
[36:35.160 --> 36:38.240]  I mean, he had one game his first game back.
[36:38.240 --> 36:39.240]  He didn't miss a shot.
[36:39.240 --> 36:43.160]  He was like 13 for 13 or 14 for 14 from the field.
[36:43.160 --> 36:44.160]  And they were all dunks.
[36:44.160 --> 36:45.160]  He didn't.
[36:45.160 --> 36:46.680]  He literally didn't miss a shot.
[36:46.680 --> 36:51.480]  I mean, they're they're unfortunately dominant.
[36:51.480 --> 36:56.800]  I mean, it's hopefully something terrible, you know, not not an injury.
[36:56.800 --> 37:01.640]  I've never read for an injury, but some kind of fluke bad luck afflicts them.
[37:01.640 --> 37:02.640]  All right.
[37:02.640 --> 37:03.880]  Who do you got?
[37:03.880 --> 37:10.520]  Well, so I do a, you know, bracket with some idiot friends from college and including myself
[37:10.520 --> 37:12.280]  in that I'm one of the idiot friends.
[37:12.280 --> 37:18.720]  But my move is to grab a celebrity bracket and then change like three things.
[37:18.720 --> 37:24.520]  So I grabbed a bracket that had Gonzaga and and I honestly couldn't tell you much more.
[37:24.520 --> 37:30.160]  I've got Duke losing, I think, in the final four because I think they face Gonzaga.
[37:30.160 --> 37:32.040]  So I think I've got them losing there.
[37:32.040 --> 37:33.040]  But yeah.
[37:33.040 --> 37:34.040]  Yeah.
[37:34.040 --> 37:38.840]  It's set up where if if the favorites win, it would be Duke Gonzaga in the final.
[37:38.840 --> 37:39.840]  Right.
[37:39.840 --> 37:44.240]  Here's one, I noticed this while I was filling out my bracket.
[37:44.240 --> 37:52.800]  And I don't mean if there are alumni of this university listening, I'm not I'm really not
[37:52.800 --> 37:54.760]  trying to slag on it.
[37:54.760 --> 38:02.120]  But for the first time in my life, it really struck me what an unusual name Ole Miss is.
[38:02.120 --> 38:04.440]  Is that their proper name?
[38:04.440 --> 38:05.880]  I don't even know.
[38:05.880 --> 38:06.880]  Is it?
[38:06.880 --> 38:08.080]  It's that's how it's listed on the bracket.
[38:08.080 --> 38:09.080]  Right.
[38:09.080 --> 38:10.080]  Yeah.
[38:10.080 --> 38:11.080]  No, it's University of Mississippi.
[38:11.080 --> 38:15.720]  I'm not looking at their Wikipedia page colloquial colloquially known as Ole Miss.
[38:15.720 --> 38:18.160]  Yeah, that is a it's a very strange name.
[38:18.160 --> 38:20.920]  So when you get your diploma, it doesn't say Ole Miss.
[38:20.920 --> 38:21.920]  Probably not.
[38:21.920 --> 38:22.920]  Yeah.
[38:22.920 --> 38:26.720]  What an unusual name.
[38:26.720 --> 38:30.080]  Like, particularly the Oh, well, right, right, right.
[38:30.080 --> 38:33.640]  It's not Oh, well, apostrophe it, right, right.
[38:33.640 --> 38:38.280]  I could even give them the apostrophe if that's what you that's how you say it.
[38:38.280 --> 38:47.000]  You know, like, like, in that part of the country, people will often use the the collective
[38:47.000 --> 38:52.520]  second person pronoun y'all were sharp, and you would, which I believe is properly spelled
[38:52.520 --> 39:00.880]  y apostrophe a ll, which is actually linguistically a much needed pronoun in the English language.
[39:00.880 --> 39:06.540]  Probably the there's, in my opinion, the single biggest deficiency in standard written English
[39:06.540 --> 39:10.640]  is the lack of a a second person plural.
[39:10.640 --> 39:11.640]  Sure.
[39:11.640 --> 39:16.120]  You know, here in Philly, we've got us.
[39:16.120 --> 39:17.940]  Don't don't even don't even talk about Pittsburgh.
[39:17.940 --> 39:21.240]  I get sick to my stomach here in this one.
[39:21.240 --> 39:25.080]  I'm sorry, people from Pittsburgh, but it's disgusting.
[39:25.080 --> 39:26.080]  Young stuff.
[39:26.080 --> 39:27.080]  Is it young?
[39:27.080 --> 39:28.080]  Or years?
[39:28.080 --> 39:29.080]  Yeah.
[39:29.080 --> 39:30.880]  Oh, we should get Amy back on.
[39:30.880 --> 39:32.520]  She could tell us.
[39:32.520 --> 39:38.120]  I forget what it is, but I remember the first time I went out there to see her, which my
[39:38.120 --> 39:43.520]  wife Amy was both an undergrad and then went to Pitt Law School.
[39:43.520 --> 39:47.920]  The first time I went out there, I heard people say you know, I honestly looked around like
[39:47.920 --> 39:48.920]  for hidden cameras.
[39:48.920 --> 39:52.200]  Like I thought maybe I was on the the punk show, right?
[39:52.200 --> 39:56.760]  Because it's not something that's like, you'll hear y'all in the Northeast, not often, but
[39:56.760 --> 40:00.560]  you'll hear it and write and you know, understand what it means that one.
[40:00.560 --> 40:04.760]  I think I first heard it when I first visited Pittsburgh as well, and I had no idea what
[40:04.760 --> 40:09.760]  it even meant.
[40:09.760 --> 40:14.620]  It's Pittsburgh, I've always said that Pittsburgh is the closest, in my opinion, the closest
[40:14.620 --> 40:19.360]  America gets to Springfield from the Simpsons.
[40:19.360 --> 40:23.920]  Where it is, it is nowhere.
[40:23.920 --> 40:27.280]  It's not the Midwest, it is not the East Coast.
[40:27.280 --> 40:32.560]  They have their own brand of beer that everybody drinks exactly, you know, like where Springfield
[40:32.560 --> 40:40.760]  has Duff, Pittsburgh has, I can't say it right, it's Iron City, but they have a very particular
[40:40.760 --> 40:47.960]  way of pronouncing it, Iron City, Iron City beer, and it's everywhere, and you can't get
[40:47.960 --> 40:48.960]  it anywhere else.
[40:48.960 --> 40:56.920]  There is nowhere else to get it, and they say things that nobody else says.
[40:56.920 --> 41:01.160]  It's a charming city, but it is really unusual.
[41:01.160 --> 41:07.320]  All right, now that we've offended all the people from Pittsburgh.
[41:07.320 --> 41:08.320]  And the people from Ole Miss.
[41:08.320 --> 41:09.320]  Sure.
[41:09.320 --> 41:12.560]  Well, I don't think we've offended them, and I think even they would admit that that is
[41:12.560 --> 41:13.560]  an unusual name.
[41:13.560 --> 41:14.840]  Yeah, I just did a quick look.
[41:14.840 --> 41:19.720]  I can't see an indication of where that originates without, you know, doing a deeper dive.
[41:19.720 --> 41:23.720]  Yeah, and can you think of another school that goes by a nickname?
[41:23.720 --> 41:24.720]  Yeah.
[41:24.720 --> 41:28.520]  A school that just goes by something that is other than its real name, you know.
[41:28.520 --> 41:30.440]  I mean, what did you say the real name is?
[41:30.440 --> 41:31.440]  I have no idea.
[41:31.440 --> 41:32.440]  Mississippi State.
[41:32.440 --> 41:33.680]  University of Mississippi.
[41:33.680 --> 41:34.680]  University of Mississippi.
[41:34.680 --> 41:36.640]  But yeah, I guess I don't know.
[41:36.640 --> 41:39.960]  I don't know anyone who went to Ole Miss, so I don't know if they identify as being
[41:39.960 --> 41:45.960]  from Ole Miss or University of Mississippi, I don't know.
[41:45.960 --> 41:46.960]  Somebody let me know.
[41:46.960 --> 41:47.960]  Let me know what's on the diploma.
[41:47.960 --> 41:48.960]  There you go.
[41:48.960 --> 41:51.840]  Get a picture of that diploma.
[41:51.840 --> 41:53.280]  We got lots of news to cover.
[41:53.280 --> 42:00.000]  Apple had an unusual week where I can't think of anything else quite like it.
[42:00.000 --> 42:06.200]  So there's an event next week on Monday, March 25th, which is much rumored to be about
[42:06.200 --> 42:07.200]  subscription services.
[42:07.200 --> 42:10.240]  We'll get to that at the end of the show.
[42:10.240 --> 42:15.440]  I heard reliably, although not from someone at Apple secondhand, but somebody else in
[42:15.440 --> 42:16.440]  the press.
[42:16.440 --> 42:18.920]  It was Panzareno, I'll just say it.
[42:18.920 --> 42:26.400]  I had heard that word was out over a week, well over a week ago, that there would be
[42:26.400 --> 42:33.320]  quote unquote no hardware at the Apple event on March 25th, yet there were all sorts of
[42:33.320 --> 42:38.680]  devices and things that were rumored to be imminent.
[42:38.680 --> 42:43.360]  IMAX were overdue for an update.
[42:43.360 --> 42:48.560]  Everybody has been thinking that there's new AirPods coming out, which was true, and that
[42:48.560 --> 42:50.760]  none of this would come out at the event.
[42:50.760 --> 42:55.440]  Turns out it all came out drip by drip, day by day this week.
[42:55.440 --> 42:56.440]  Right, right.
[42:56.440 --> 43:03.440]  Three straight days of announcements, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, just press release and
[43:03.440 --> 43:04.640]  here's some new hardware.
[43:04.640 --> 43:08.840]  Yeah, and then it got people into sort of like a fever.
[43:08.840 --> 43:09.840]  People got excited.
[43:09.840 --> 43:13.080]  Right, nothing came on Thursday.
[43:13.080 --> 43:16.560]  Everybody was convinced that we were going to get a new Apple product every day, maybe
[43:16.560 --> 43:18.040]  for the rest of time.
[43:18.040 --> 43:19.760]  At least for the rest of the week.
[43:19.760 --> 43:20.760]  Right.
[43:20.760 --> 43:22.640]  Like Mac rumors even ran like a story.
[43:22.640 --> 43:29.480]  They're like, I knew iPod touch is coming tomorrow and it didn't, but it was a good
[43:29.480 --> 43:30.480]  shot.
[43:30.480 --> 43:31.480]  Yeah.
[43:31.480 --> 43:32.480]  Yeah.
[43:32.480 --> 43:38.480]  Um, no, but the other curious thing from the inside here, here we go into, uh, like I always
[43:38.480 --> 43:40.320]  say, director's commentary on during fireball.
[43:40.320 --> 43:45.800]  The interesting part, which I can now say is that on Monday I was in New York, um, and
[43:45.800 --> 43:50.960]  they had, they had similar briefings and Cupertino for the West Coast press, but, uh, they had
[43:50.960 --> 44:00.040]  press briefings Monday in New York and Cupertino for the new IMAX and the new iPads, the iPad
[44:00.040 --> 44:02.240]  air and the iPad mini.
[44:02.240 --> 44:07.680]  Um, that was where I took delivery of a review unit of the iPad mini.
[44:07.680 --> 44:12.720]  Um, but there absolutely no mention Monday about new AirPods.
[44:12.720 --> 44:13.720]  They did.
[44:13.720 --> 44:14.720]  They didn't tell us about it.
[44:14.720 --> 44:18.800]  They didn't have them there for us to see their, to my knowledge, nobody got review
[44:18.800 --> 44:19.800]  units.
[44:19.800 --> 44:23.200]  If somebody has a review unit, it's not me and the reviews aren't out yet.
[44:23.200 --> 44:24.200]  Right.
[44:24.200 --> 44:27.920]  You had mentioned that you'd, you'd gotten this, this iPad mini and, uh, and I said,
[44:27.920 --> 44:31.000]  well, you know, is there any news on, on new AirPods?
[44:31.000 --> 44:32.520]  And you said, no, nothing else.
[44:32.520 --> 44:34.440]  Just the iPads and the iMac.
[44:34.440 --> 44:41.200]  And then Wednesday you look like an idiot because there they are, it is the new AirPods.
[44:41.200 --> 44:44.720]  I think I understand their strategy.
[44:44.720 --> 44:51.440]  I mean, one thing about Apple PR is they do not like to explain themselves for public
[44:51.440 --> 44:56.480]  relations and marketing, getting, well, getting the silent treatment on things.
[44:56.480 --> 45:01.120]  Well, they love to explain their products, but they do not like to explain their, their
[45:01.120 --> 45:02.120]  strategy.
[45:02.120 --> 45:06.640]  So asking them like, Hey, why, why, why did you not give us AirPods?
[45:06.640 --> 45:11.680]  They'll they'll have an answer, but it's just like some kind of nonsense answer.
[45:11.680 --> 45:15.720]  Um, but I think, I think the thinking is twofold.
[45:15.720 --> 45:22.040]  I think one, the sort of day by day strategy was just to sort of keep Apple in, in the
[45:22.040 --> 45:25.520]  news cycle leading up to next week's event.
[45:25.520 --> 45:31.880]  So, you know, Monday there were, there was Apple news, Tuesday, there was Apple news,
[45:31.880 --> 45:35.120]  uh, Wednesday, wait, is that right?
[45:35.120 --> 45:36.640]  It was Monday.
[45:36.640 --> 45:38.600]  Did it start with the iPads and then do the IMAX?
[45:38.600 --> 45:39.600]  Is that the right order?
[45:39.600 --> 45:40.600]  Yeah.
[45:40.600 --> 45:41.960]  Is that right?
[45:41.960 --> 45:42.960]  I think that is right.
[45:42.960 --> 45:43.960]  Yeah.
[45:43.960 --> 45:46.360]  I think the IMAX were under embargo until Tuesday.
[45:46.360 --> 45:47.360]  Okay.
[45:47.360 --> 45:48.360]  The news about them.
[45:48.360 --> 45:55.200]  Uh, uh, and then Wednesday was the AirPods two, they're not really calling it the AirPods
[45:55.200 --> 45:56.200]  two.
[45:56.200 --> 45:57.200]  They're just all right.
[45:57.200 --> 45:58.200]  The new AirPods.
[45:58.200 --> 46:04.120]  And then Thursday was the reviews of the IMAX mini came out just to, you know, that was
[46:04.120 --> 46:05.120]  something.
[46:05.120 --> 46:07.760]  And then I guess today there's, I pet me, what did I say?
[46:07.760 --> 46:12.640]  IMAX mini, which I didn't know what that would be.
[46:12.640 --> 46:15.720]  Just be like the old 17 inch, uh, flower bar.
[46:15.720 --> 46:17.720]  Just a smaller IMAX.
[46:17.720 --> 46:18.720]  Yeah.
[46:18.720 --> 46:20.480]  Um, yeah.
[46:20.480 --> 46:24.320]  So I think that this, the basic idea was just, Hey, let's have a little bit of news every
[46:24.320 --> 46:26.320]  day of the week just to keep Apple in the news.
[46:26.320 --> 46:30.120]  And then, you know, everybody will be thinking about Apple leading up to Monday's, you know,
[46:30.120 --> 46:33.640]  big event where presumably all the big stuff will be announced.
[46:33.640 --> 46:36.560]  Otherwise people aren't thinking about the biggest company in the world.
[46:36.560 --> 46:42.480]  They just, if they don't do something every single day of the week, people won't pay any
[46:42.480 --> 46:43.480]  attention.
[46:43.480 --> 46:45.120]  People will forget about Apple.
[46:45.120 --> 46:51.320]  And I think that maybe the reason they didn't see review units of AirPod, uh, the new AirPods
[46:51.320 --> 46:57.800]  is that they, uh, at least according to their website, they require the very latest version
[46:57.800 --> 47:00.160]  of Mac OS and iOS.
[47:00.160 --> 47:02.080]  Newer than we currently have right now.
[47:02.080 --> 47:03.080]  You mean?
[47:03.080 --> 47:12.720]  I think it's iOS 12.2 and Mac OS 10.14 point whatever, which are currently in beta as we
[47:12.720 --> 47:18.960]  record and this week and presumably will come out on Monday, I guess after the event and
[47:18.960 --> 47:20.960]  before people start getting these AirPods.
[47:20.960 --> 47:21.960]  Right.
[47:21.960 --> 47:25.200]  Um, and I guess the, you know, it makes sense to me that they, it, for whatever technical
[47:25.200 --> 47:31.480]  reason that is that, that they require these very latest Mac OS and iOS versions, they
[47:31.480 --> 47:35.720]  don't want reviewers to have to install beta versions of, you know, Mac OS and iOS just
[47:35.720 --> 47:36.720]  to test AirPods.
[47:36.720 --> 47:39.480]  So I, I don't know if they gave you an iPad.
[47:39.480 --> 47:42.280]  What's the iPad mini running?
[47:42.280 --> 47:43.280]  That's a good question.
[47:43.280 --> 47:44.280]  I don't have it handy.
[47:44.280 --> 47:51.240]  Uh, I guess it's running 12.1 point whatever.
[47:51.240 --> 47:52.240]  I don't know.
[47:52.240 --> 47:55.280]  I should, I should look, I don't have it handy though.
[47:55.280 --> 47:56.780]  It's not running 12.2 though.
[47:56.780 --> 47:58.440]  You're sure it's not?
[47:58.440 --> 47:59.440]  Pretty sure.
[47:59.440 --> 48:02.760]  I mean, they certainly, if they give you, I mean, I guess, uh, I guess that's risky.
[48:02.760 --> 48:06.680]  If you give out a review unit with a beta OS and there's some sort of an issue, then
[48:06.680 --> 48:09.480]  you don't know whether to ascribe it to the hardware or the software.
[48:09.480 --> 48:12.680]  Yeah, they've, I'm trying to think if they've ever done that before.
[48:12.680 --> 48:13.680]  Uh, not really.
[48:13.680 --> 48:14.680]  I don't think so.
[48:14.680 --> 48:17.400]  They tend not to do that.
[48:17.400 --> 48:22.920]  Um, the weirdest thing they've ever done in my experience is AirPod related where back
[48:22.920 --> 48:27.840]  whatever year it was when the AirPods came out, they gave us quote unquote prototype
[48:27.840 --> 48:32.160]  AirPods after the, was it the September of 2016?
[48:32.160 --> 48:36.120]  Yeah, it was like September or October of 2016.
[48:36.120 --> 48:40.880]  So they gave the people who got the phones for review, they gave them AirPods, but they
[48:40.880 --> 48:45.840]  said, these are prototypes and we will need these back when we ship the real AirPods.
[48:45.840 --> 48:51.440]  And then like, and they're usually very lax about like asking for review hardware back.
[48:51.440 --> 48:54.640]  Like every once in a while you get, I get like a reminder that says like, here's, you
[48:54.640 --> 48:59.320]  know, here's the inventory of the stuff that's sitting somewhere in your house, sitting somewhere
[48:59.320 --> 49:00.320]  in my office.
[49:00.320 --> 49:03.120]  Here's all this stuff you have that's sitting in your office that you should send back.
[49:03.120 --> 49:08.400]  And then I just send it, you know, I put it all in, like I tend to do it in a terrible
[49:08.400 --> 49:09.400]  dump.
[49:09.400 --> 49:14.880]  You know, just, just throw it all in one Rubbermaid crate and slap a ship, ship it back, ship
[49:14.880 --> 49:17.800]  it all back to Apple all at once.
[49:17.800 --> 49:18.960]  But they're very nice about it.
[49:18.960 --> 49:24.480]  You know, it's all very lax, but with those AirPods is that the day that the real ones
[49:24.480 --> 49:26.800]  came out and they're like, okay, we're now shipping AirPods.
[49:26.800 --> 49:29.800]  They were like, please send us back the prototypes.
[49:29.800 --> 49:32.720]  Here is a FedEx prepaid label.
[49:32.720 --> 49:33.720]  We need this tomorrow.
[49:33.720 --> 49:37.040]  So how many weeks did it take you to get them back to them, John?
[49:37.040 --> 49:40.920]  No, I sent it, it was very clear that they wanted them back immediately.
[49:40.920 --> 49:43.000]  So I actually sent them back right on the day.
[49:43.000 --> 49:48.000]  I was like, I don't know why they have such a, you know, ants in their pants on this issue,
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  but whatever it is, I'll send it back.
[49:50.000 --> 49:55.200]  And the funny thing is, is I know I had them, Pansarino had them, Renee had them, a bunch
[49:55.200 --> 49:59.440]  of people, you know, who were regular guests on the show had, had those and all of us agreed.
[49:59.440 --> 50:02.240]  They were, there was no way to tell that they were not AirPods.
[50:02.240 --> 50:03.680]  That's what I was going to ask.
[50:03.680 --> 50:06.860]  Was there any physical difference that you could see?
[50:06.860 --> 50:09.840]  No physical difference, no, no functional difference.
[50:09.840 --> 50:15.920]  I have no idea what made those quote unquote prototypes, you know, and what, what the difference
[50:15.920 --> 50:16.920]  was.
[50:16.920 --> 50:22.480]  The difference of using them was exactly the same, but you know, but anyway, what do you
[50:22.480 --> 50:23.480]  want to talk about first?
[50:23.480 --> 50:26.400]  Well, let's, we're, we're talking AirPods, let's, can we, should we talk battery life
[50:26.400 --> 50:27.720]  on these, on the AirPods?
[50:27.720 --> 50:28.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[50:28.720 --> 50:31.360]  So, yeah, so that's, that's a good, that's a good topic.
[50:31.360 --> 50:33.600]  So this was, this was interesting.
[50:33.600 --> 50:37.640]  I sent you an article and then I can't remember if it's from this article or yeah, so the
[50:37.640 --> 50:42.560]  article talks about how two years ago, this guy heard everybody on podcasts raving about
[50:42.560 --> 50:43.640]  AirPods.
[50:43.640 --> 50:49.120]  And so he decided to buy a pair and now two years later, you know, early 2017, he buys
[50:49.120 --> 50:50.760]  them early 2019.
[50:50.760 --> 50:54.720]  He's had them for a couple of years and that the battery life on them is crap.
[50:54.720 --> 50:58.940]  And that now he hears all sorts of people on podcasts complaining about a similar issue
[50:58.940 --> 51:01.380]  with poor battery life on their AirPods.
[51:01.380 --> 51:06.140]  And I know you and I have had discussions with several people who've run into this exact
[51:06.140 --> 51:07.140]  same issue.
[51:07.140 --> 51:10.340]  Yeah, Amy's, Amy's got that issue and it didn't do her.
[51:10.340 --> 51:11.340]  Before they went through the wash.
[51:11.340 --> 51:15.160]  Let's set that aside as a caveat.
[51:15.160 --> 51:16.160]  Yeah.
[51:16.160 --> 51:22.880]  Uh, and I've noticed too, cause I tend to like one of the things I do, I listen to long
[51:22.880 --> 51:23.880]  podcasts.
[51:23.880 --> 51:30.080]  I listen to like ATP and, um, I listen to a long enough podcast and I get to the point
[51:30.080 --> 51:34.160]  where they start, uh, playing that sad little beep boop boop, right?
[51:34.160 --> 51:35.160]  Yeah.
[51:35.160 --> 51:41.320]  So I use them, I have them with me most days, but I use them for brief phone calls and maybe
[51:41.320 --> 51:42.400]  a little bit of music listening.
[51:42.400 --> 51:44.360]  I almost never hit this.
[51:44.360 --> 51:49.480]  So I have not had any complaints about the battery life, but it's very clear that, you
[51:49.480 --> 51:55.840]  know, battery, we, we all know batteries degrade over time and these do not through cycles,
[51:55.840 --> 51:56.840]  right?
[51:56.840 --> 52:01.600]  Not just time, but you know, as, as you charge and discharge and charge and discharge that
[52:01.600 --> 52:04.280]  the battery deteriorates.
[52:04.280 --> 52:11.580]  So I, and, and these, these devices have really no way for somebody to replace the battery.
[52:11.580 --> 52:16.440]  So you know, the iPhone obviously famously had issues with batteries and an Apple Institute
[52:16.440 --> 52:20.560]  or replacement plan, and, uh, you had to go to Apple to do it and you still have to go
[52:20.560 --> 52:23.880]  to Apple to do it, but it is possible to do to my knowledge.
[52:23.880 --> 52:26.640]  Apple does not have anything for the batteries in the AirPods.
[52:26.640 --> 52:27.640]  Is that right?
[52:27.640 --> 52:29.640]  No, I don't think so.
[52:29.640 --> 52:31.000]  No, they definitely do.
[52:31.000 --> 52:32.000]  Right.
[52:32.000 --> 52:37.520]  Uh, if you, if you two years in, if your AirPods, if their batteries are so crummy that, you
[52:37.520 --> 52:42.320]  know, they're unusable or you're not getting enough use time out of them, your option is
[52:42.320 --> 52:48.520]  pretty much throw them away or hopefully recycle them with Apple, I think, but not, not, uh,
[52:48.520 --> 52:54.080]  not get a new battery for 50 bucks or, or even, you know, any amount of money.
[52:54.080 --> 52:55.080]  Yeah.
[52:55.080 --> 52:57.360]  There's no replacement for, and it does seem wasteful now.
[52:57.360 --> 52:59.000]  You know, you really think about it.
[52:59.000 --> 53:00.920]  There are 160 bucks.
[53:00.920 --> 53:02.440]  They still sound great, right?
[53:02.440 --> 53:04.040]  It's just the battery, right?
[53:04.040 --> 53:08.440]  Mine, you know, there's nothing wrong with mine, which I've had, you know, since December
[53:08.440 --> 53:12.800]  of 2016, I guess now, uh, absolutely nothing wrong with them.
[53:12.800 --> 53:13.800]  I've never lost one.
[53:13.800 --> 53:14.800]  Right.
[53:14.800 --> 53:19.800]  Amazingly, uh, yet, and my battery life is okay, but I can definitely tell it's not as
[53:19.800 --> 53:23.160]  good as it used to be because when they were brand new, I never heard that sound.
[53:23.160 --> 53:24.160]  Right.
[53:24.160 --> 53:26.720]  I remember people saying it and I was like, well, I gotta like keep these out of the case
[53:26.720 --> 53:35.000]  because I, one of the ways that I've never lost one is that I'm very, very, very religious
[53:35.000 --> 53:40.440]  about like, it's either in my ear, in my hand or in the case, I never put them anywhere
[53:40.440 --> 53:41.440]  else.
[53:41.440 --> 53:46.040]  And so, but you keep putting them in the case and they keep charging through cycles, right?
[53:46.040 --> 53:49.240]  It was only, you know, I would say only in the last year have I started hearing that
[53:49.240 --> 53:52.680]  sound and I don't, my, my use isn't any different.
[53:52.680 --> 53:56.680]  So they clearly don't get as good a battery life as they used to.
[53:56.680 --> 54:02.000]  And as you said, it's, it's interesting because these are, these are, Amy noted that when
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.600]  these first came out, people said, well, they look dumb.
[54:04.600 --> 54:10.080]  And I have definitely noticed in the past six months that it is very rare to see somebody
[54:10.080 --> 54:12.600]  using headphones that are not AirPods.
[54:12.600 --> 54:17.280]  I shouldn't say very rare, but it's very common to see them the same way 10 or 15 years ago,
[54:17.280 --> 54:22.360]  you'd see the white corded headphones for, for iPods, uh, AirPods have become that, which
[54:22.360 --> 54:23.740]  is incredible.
[54:23.740 --> 54:29.360]  But if they have a two year or even, even a three year lifespan, uh, and then they're
[54:29.360 --> 54:34.360]  literally just trash, that's pretty bad for a high end product.
[54:34.360 --> 54:39.620]  The iPod headphones were 20 or 30 bucks, which was probably too expensive for what they were,
[54:39.620 --> 54:42.600]  but they were cheap by comparison.
[54:42.600 --> 54:46.380]  And you know, if, if those got disposable cause the cord freight or whatever, not the
[54:46.380 --> 54:51.080]  end of the world, but when you're paying 160 bucks for a pair of headphones, uh, it's not
[54:51.080 --> 54:53.840]  unreasonable to think, Hey, these should last me.
[54:53.840 --> 54:56.880]  I don't know what the right number is, but five or 10 years.
[54:56.880 --> 55:00.200]  Uh, and if I have to pay a little bit to replace the battery, okay.
[55:00.200 --> 55:04.960]  But Apple has obviously moved away from any sort of replaceable battery.
[55:04.960 --> 55:08.860]  I don't think there's, uh, just off the top of my head, I can't think of any product where
[55:08.860 --> 55:13.040]  you can replace the battery short of taking it to Apple at least.
[55:13.040 --> 55:14.120]  Yeah.
[55:14.120 --> 55:15.120]  It seems like a shame.
[55:15.120 --> 55:20.200]  I mean, I get it, you know, there's just these little things that are glued together, but
[55:20.200 --> 55:25.760]  it, it, it, I, it's one of those things that I feel they're very futuristic, right?
[55:25.760 --> 55:28.920]  Like if you could go back in time and say, Oh my God, you're going to have these wireless
[55:28.920 --> 55:35.220]  headphones with practically no latency and they run for hours and they stay in perfect
[55:35.220 --> 55:40.120]  sync even though they're not connected to each other at all, uh, you'd be like that.
[55:40.120 --> 55:44.000]  That's an amazing futuristic product, but I can't help but think that like 10, 20 years
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.960]  from now, we're going to look back and say, my God, what a waste we're spending $160 on
[55:48.960 --> 55:50.680]  these things that only lasted three years.
[55:50.680 --> 55:51.680]  Right.
[55:51.680 --> 55:55.520]  Well, and, and it's, it's funny because I haven't hit this battery issue yet, but sooner
[55:55.520 --> 55:58.680]  or later I will, and I'll want to replace them.
[55:58.680 --> 56:04.480]  And I, I feel bad saying it, but I'll probably buy another pair of AirPods and, and like
[56:04.480 --> 56:05.960]  I said, I hope they recycle them.
[56:05.960 --> 56:07.160]  I hope you can turn them into Apple.
[56:07.160 --> 56:08.680]  I haven't looked to see if you're able to do that.
[56:08.680 --> 56:15.460]  I assume so, but that's even, that's a pretty poor way to handle it as opposed to throwing
[56:15.460 --> 56:20.720]  a new battery in there or I, you know, some sort of upgrade, uh, that, that currently
[56:20.720 --> 56:21.720]  is impossible.
[56:21.720 --> 56:22.720]  Yeah.
[56:22.720 --> 56:29.040]  Uh, so the new ones, they have the, they have a new chip, H, the H1 chip, which when I first
[56:29.040 --> 56:32.000]  linked it up, I was like, I wonder why, why, you know, cause the other ones had like the
[56:32.000 --> 56:39.040]  W1 chip, uh, which I thought was like wireless, I guess that's what the W was.
[56:39.040 --> 56:42.980]  But now, you know, the watches still have W chips, you know, they have their system
[56:42.980 --> 56:44.120]  chips are the S.
[56:44.120 --> 56:49.640]  So it's like the S3 or the S2, and then they have the W chip for their wireless communication.
[56:49.640 --> 56:54.240]  But these headphones, the new AirPods have the H1 when I wondered about it.
[56:54.240 --> 56:57.720]  And then I got an answer from somebody who would know that the H is for headphones.
[56:57.720 --> 57:01.720]  That was certainly the assumption, but yeah, you've, you've confirmed that.
[57:01.720 --> 57:02.720]  Right.
[57:02.720 --> 57:04.920]  I have confirmed that the H is for headphones.
[57:04.920 --> 57:11.740]  Um, uh, somebody speculated another good guess was that the H was for, Hey Siri, uh, which
[57:11.740 --> 57:18.600]  I guess I, I always try not to say on the show, so sorry, but there's my iPad lighting
[57:18.600 --> 57:19.600]  up.
[57:19.600 --> 57:20.600]  Yeah.
[57:20.600 --> 57:21.600]  Hey dingus.
[57:21.600 --> 57:25.200]  Uh, which is a good guess, but it's not, it's for headphones.
[57:25.200 --> 57:29.000]  Um, and they get, you know, supposedly they have longer talk time.
[57:29.000 --> 57:34.960]  Talk time was always sort of the, uh, it seems like that microphone really drains the battery.
[57:34.960 --> 57:38.020]  But the nice thing about the, so there's two things here, but the nice thing about the
[57:38.020 --> 57:41.320]  talk time, even when it was, I think it was two hours and now it's three hours.
[57:41.320 --> 57:42.320]  Is that right?
[57:42.320 --> 57:43.320]  Something like that.
[57:43.320 --> 57:47.080]  Well, but the thing is when, when you're using it as a headset, it's easy enough to just
[57:47.080 --> 57:52.000]  use one because they both have a microphone and you know, obviously you won't hear out
[57:52.000 --> 57:53.000]  of both ears.
[57:53.000 --> 57:55.840]  You won't hear your conversation, but, uh, the person on the other end won't really know
[57:55.840 --> 57:58.520]  that you only are using one at a time.
[57:58.520 --> 58:02.160]  Uh, so even if you have a long phone conversation, it's possible to swap those.
[58:02.160 --> 58:06.180]  Whereas if you're listening to music, you really probably want both those, those headphones
[58:06.180 --> 58:08.180]  in your ears.
[58:08.180 --> 58:11.600]  But the thing that I noticed with this was that none of the other battery life was any
[58:11.600 --> 58:12.600]  better.
[58:12.600 --> 58:17.360]  No, it doesn't seem like it seems like, you know, or at least, I mean, if it is better,
[58:17.360 --> 58:19.320]  they're not, they're not touting it as better.
[58:19.320 --> 58:20.320]  Yeah.
[58:20.320 --> 58:21.320]  Right.
[58:21.320 --> 58:22.320]  Right.
[58:22.320 --> 58:23.320]  Yeah.
[58:23.320 --> 58:24.320]  And it's funny that they're not calling them AirPods too.
[58:24.320 --> 58:26.040]  They're just sort of, it's sort of a quiet announcement.
[58:26.040 --> 58:30.720]  They're just sort of, you know, Hey, we've, we've refreshed them, you know, even though
[58:30.720 --> 58:36.760]  it seems like it is, it is an all new chip and now they have the optional wireless charging
[58:36.760 --> 58:41.200]  case, which is, uh, what is extra 40 extra bucks for it?
[58:41.200 --> 58:45.400]  So yeah, I use a wireless charging pad for my phone at night.
[58:45.400 --> 58:50.160]  It's easy to just toss down on, uh, but I don't think I'd pay the extra 40 bucks for
[58:50.160 --> 58:51.160]  that case.
[58:51.160 --> 58:58.880]  I, I, it's a close call for me cause it's like, I, I kind of, I'd like to have the functionality,
[58:58.880 --> 59:04.240]  but 40 bucks is quite a lot for, you know, something you certainly don't need.
[59:04.240 --> 59:05.240]  Yeah.
[59:05.240 --> 59:07.560]  And then they charge so fast, right?
[59:07.560 --> 59:11.760]  Like the nice thing about, you know, like your phone typically at the end of the day,
[59:11.760 --> 59:14.720]  my phone at least is always under 50%.
[59:14.720 --> 59:16.880]  So it needs, you know, a lot of charge.
[59:16.880 --> 59:22.120]  And so overnight, you know, just put it on the bedside pad and fall asleep and then assume
[59:22.120 --> 59:23.520]  it'll be full when you wake up.
[59:23.520 --> 59:24.520]  It's fine.
[59:24.520 --> 59:28.960]  But with the AirPods, like I really, it really is true that like if I feel like they're low,
[59:28.960 --> 59:33.200]  I can just plug them into a lightning cable and a couple minutes later they're 100% right.
[59:33.200 --> 59:34.200]  Right.
[59:34.200 --> 59:37.720]  And then if it were 10 bucks more, I'd say, yeah, sure, I'll buy it just in case I ever
[59:37.720 --> 59:38.720]  want that.
[59:38.720 --> 59:42.120]  But if they've managed to find a price point where, like you said, I'm sort of on the fence
[59:42.120 --> 59:46.920]  about it and you know, I don't think I'd buy it, but maybe I'd convince myself that I should
[59:46.920 --> 59:47.920]  get it.
[59:47.920 --> 59:52.400]  And I don't know, they seem to have some science there with those prices, I think.
[59:52.400 --> 59:59.320]  The other thing that is nice is that the case is available by itself for $80.
[59:59.320 --> 01:00:03.600]  I'm trying to train myself to round up.
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:11.680]  So rounding up on the nine, see on a 99, like, you know, $49.99 is 50 bucks, 49 bucks.
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:14.080]  I'm okay with calling that 49 bucks, but whatever.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.080]  All right.
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:18.760]  Well, it's $79, AKA $80.
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:24.560]  But you can buy it as a standalone case and it is, it's compatible with the original AirPods.
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:30.040]  So if you have existing AirPods and you really want that case, you can spend 80 bucks to
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.920]  get the case and it'll work with your AirPods, which seems very nice.
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:33.920]  That was interesting.
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:37.400]  But then going back to what we were talking about with battery life, if you've had those
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:42.400]  AirPods already for a year or two, you may well be better served just getting a whole
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.560]  new pair.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:48.640]  Like I, you're, you're describing your AirPods as not having great battery life.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:51.360]  It'd be pretty foolish for you to just buy the case at this point.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:52.360]  Yeah.
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.120]  But on the other hand, I'm loyal.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:55.120]  Like I feel like these are my AirPods.
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.120]  You know what I mean?
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.120]  Like I, you know what I mean?
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.680]  Like I'm not going to ditch them just cause they're old.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:01.680]  You know, you don't want to be sticking new things in your ears.
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:03.920]  I don't know.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.880]  It's I don't know.
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:09.360]  I have, I feel like I have a sense of loyalty to them.
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:12.560]  Like with the phones, I don't, you know, as soon as the new phone comes out, I'm like
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:13.560]  this old phone is garbage.
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:19.400]  Eric, put it on a shelf, but with my AirPods, I feel like they're, you know, we've been
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.400]  places together.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:24.720]  I'm not going to abandon them just cause the battery life is sunk.
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:25.720]  You know, it's not bad.
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:26.800]  My battery life isn't terrible.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:27.800]  That's the other thing.
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.120]  Well, but it's not, you know, it's, if you know it's going down, you know, it's getting
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.120]  worse over time.
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.120]  Right.
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:38.680]  Uh, the other thing too is, is to charge them overnight.
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:45.600]  You really kind of need the air power, which doesn't appear to exist at all, right?
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:51.640]  Because my, at least I have a couple of these Qi compatible phone chargers and they're all
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:52.640]  small enough.
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.400]  They're, they only hold a phone, right?
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.400]  They only hold a phone.
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:02:00.000]  There's no, there is no room on any of the ones that I own for a second device, even
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.760]  just a tiny little AirPods case.
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:07.680]  And not only, I think the way that they're built, they could only charge one device,
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:12.240]  even if there were physically, you know, space, space to drop the case on there.
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:15.000]  It still wouldn't work cause they can only charge one device at a time.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  I think.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  Right.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  There's some kind of communication, you know, handshake.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.960]  It's like, Hey, I'm a charging pad and your device is like, I'm a device that wants to
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:23.960]  charge on you.
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:27.200]  And then they're like, you know, nice to meet you and here's some power.
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.200]  But that's it.
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.320]  You know, I, like you said, I don't think you can do another one.
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:33.120]  It's like they only have one hand for handshaking.
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:38.760]  So we were, we were talking about this as far as where is the AirPower mat now, now
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:44.280]  that they have finally shipped this Qi compatible wireless charging case.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.880]  And I don't think we have a very good answer here, right?
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:52.840]  No, the, the wall street journal just reported this week that it is entering production.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:59.520]  There've been a whole bunch of people that found stuff in the iOS 10.12, sorry, 12.2
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:03.360]  beta that there was indication that indication that it's coming.
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:09.720]  There've been a few images found on like foreign Apple websites, like Apple Australia or whatever.
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:14.860]  But it's, it's very strange that on Wednesday they say, here's the new AirPods with a wireless
[01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:16.480]  charging case.
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:21.000]  And obviously the obvious question is, well, what do I charge these with?
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  They say Qi.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  Oh, right.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  Right.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.840]  I mean, I can charge it on a mat that I already have maybe, but, uh, you remember when you
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:33.160]  told me a year and a year and a half ago, when did they announce it was, it was fall
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.160]  of 2017, right?
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.160]  Yeah.
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:41.200]  A year and a half, 18 months ago, this is really late.
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.500]  And they did say at the time it would be later that year.
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:48.000]  So it's, you know, maybe we should only, you know, the clock should only start from December
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  of 2017.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.340]  Did they, I thought, no, no, no.
[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:53.120]  They said, they said it was coming 2018, right?
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:54.480]  No, no.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:57.680]  Originally they said it was coming later in that year.
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:03:58.680]  Really?
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.680]  It was it.
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:05.880]  Yeah, it was, it was definitely supposedly at first it was coming, uh, in 2017 it was,
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:10.800]  it was a lot like the AirPods were the year prior where they announced them along with
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:11.800]  the phone.
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.560]  And then they came out two or three months later, right at the end of December.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.560]  Right.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.720]  It was like right before Christmas, as I recall, I remember I got them on like December 21st,
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:20.720]  I ordered them.
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:21.720]  I think.
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:22.720]  Right.
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:25.720]  It was, it was cutting it as close as theoretically possible to the holidays.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:26.720]  Right.
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:27.720]  All right.
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:28.720]  Well, hold on.
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:35.160]  I got to, I got to fact check you here because, uh, the Apple PR from September of 2017 says
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.920]  coming next year on the AirPower.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:37.920]  Oh, okay.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:39.920]  Well, maybe I'm wrong.
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:40.920]  All right.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.880]  We, we, we, it says coming in 2018.
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:47.040]  That's all it said, which that's in the actual press release from September of 2017.
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.560]  Well, I'm glad you corrected me.
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:52.400]  So I don't have to listen to people on Twitter.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.760]  Well, but so, so when do we count it from?
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:05:00.140]  Because if you say in September of 2017, in 2018, this will be coming, obviously it's
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:05.080]  at least at this point, three months late, but realistically you figure before Christmas
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:08.000]  of that year and maybe halfway through that year.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:14.120]  And so, yeah, in my mind, this should have been here almost a year ago at least.
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:17.000]  And as we said, doesn't, still doesn't exist.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.600]  And, and so interesting that it's potentially in production, but then what's their strategy
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.760]  as far as announcing this goes?
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:30.520]  I can only assume it'll be the quietest release ever.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.520]  Like I don't even know.
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.760]  It'll just show up in the store.
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.120]  There won't even be a press release.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.120]  Right.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:36.720]  Well, there even be an article in newsroom.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:41.160]  I guess they have to put an article in newsroom and, but whose name, like, will Phil Schiller
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:45.360]  have a quote that says, you know, cause like the, you know, most of the stuff this week
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:50.200]  has a quote from Phil Schiller saying how great the new iPads are or how fast the new
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:56.200]  iMacs are like, is anybody going to want to put their name on this AirPower press release?
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.920]  I don't know.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:01.160]  It's it is a damn curious thing.
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:07.940]  I mean, the whole thing is strange because why did they announce this at all in 2017?
[01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:11.720]  Because when they, when that event happened, that was the first wireless charging phones,
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:17.520]  Qi charging phones, iPhones, and they gave you a phone and they gave you what?
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:20.160]  Like a, a Belkin charging pad, right?
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.160]  Yeah.
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:25.760]  There were two that they like half of the reviewers got a white one from Belkin, which
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:26.880]  I did.
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:31.080]  And then the other half got a what brand was it?
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.080]  Mophie.
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.080]  I want to say it was a Mophie.
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.080]  I remember.
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.920]  I think it's a Mophie and I think it's the one I actually have at my desk.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:41.060]  I actually paid for it to get it because I didn't like the, I didn't like the Belkin
[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:42.060]  one at all.
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:48.160]  If the Belkin one had like a really as a really ugly plug that goes in the socket, you know,
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:51.480]  the electrical socket, it's a really ugly plug.
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:56.480]  And it just seemed way too finicky in terms of getting the phone perfectly positioned
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.280]  and Oh, and the light was driving me nuts.
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:02.360]  It has like a bright green light that faces up as it's charging.
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:03.360]  Yeah.
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:06.160]  So you put it on your bed and you've got like this weird green light.
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:13.680]  Whereas the Mophie has a, a very subtle off white light that points down towards the table
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.800]  or whatever it's sitting on, which is exactly what I want.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:17.800]  I want it.
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:22.360]  You know, I like to see that light cause then I know the phone is on it properly, but it
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:26.680]  is so subtle that it doesn't, you know, distract when you're trying to sleep.
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.920]  Now does that one stay on as it's charging though?
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:29.920]  Yes.
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:30.920]  Okay.
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:34.920]  Cause I got, I don't know, I got like a $20 one on Amazon and the feature that it has,
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:39.000]  it's a subtle light, like you're describing, you put the phone on it, it lights up and
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.920]  then over 10 seconds, it fades down, which is perfect for that side.
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:44.920]  Yeah.
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:45.920]  Right.
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:49.440]  All you want is you want, you just want that light to just like know that it's charging.
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:50.440]  Right.
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:51.440]  Yeah.
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:52.440]  So they did give us charging.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.460]  So they gave you a different charging pad.
[01:07:55.460 --> 01:08:00.240]  The air power was not going to exist for or be available for sale for at least three months
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.240]  at that point.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:02.800]  But they did have them.
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:08.320]  They did have them backstage, like when I had my briefing to get, you know, the little
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:13.320]  press briefing where I got the what were the iPhones of that time?
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:18.720]  I guess it was the, the 10 S or no, the 10 original iPhone 10.
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:19.720]  Yeah.
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:24.960]  So I got the iPhone 10 in, in the room they had, you know, they always have every, everything
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:30.480]  that's new set up so you can see it, you know, per, you know, just, just see everything.
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:33.480]  All that they have, I just, all the new cases and everything.
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:39.120]  They had an air power set up and I tried it, you know, like I, I even, um, you know, took
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:40.360]  a phone off, put it back on.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:44.240]  It was, you know, there was a functioning prototype of the air power there that I could
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.240]  play with.
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:49.480]  Or they just shoved a mophie one inside of a, no, cause I remember it because they had
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:51.720]  it set up where it had a watch on it too.
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:52.720]  Okay.
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:53.720]  Okay.
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:58.240]  I think, I think what I did, I, cause my phone at the time wouldn't have been cheap
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.240]  charging.
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:02.760]  My personal phone wouldn't have been, yeah, no, but I think I had my Apple watch on and
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:07.040]  I took it off and, you know, put it on and it charged, you know, everything worked.
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:08.040]  It was nice.
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:12.280]  So, uh, I mean, I guess the, it, they, they obviously thought this was going to be done
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:16.960]  sooner than it was, uh, but probably much sooner than it was, but I, it still to me
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:21.880]  does not make sense why they bothered to pre-announce it because this is not something people were
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:24.640]  clamoring for, right?
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:25.640]  They didn't have to.
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:31.280]  And now they look foolish, you know, 16 months, 18 months on where it still is not available.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:32.280]  Yeah.
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:36.480]  If they had just kept their mouth shut about it and hadn't pre-announced it, we would have
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:40.680]  all just been, well, I don't know why Apple doesn't make a first party charging that,
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:42.440]  but I'll get one of the other ones.
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:47.200]  There's all the dude, you know, I mean, how many T chargers, if you search on Amazon,
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.600]  there's like 500 of them.
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:54.400]  Well, and even beyond that, there are now ones that will do a phone and a watch and
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:57.560]  a lightning, uh, or an AirPods case rather.
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:05.520]  So there, there are, there are alternatives to the air power already, if you really feel
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.520]  you need that.
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:11.600]  That's the other thing too is, so Digitimes, there's a story on MacRumors today that Digitimes
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:16.280]  is reporting that the journal says they're in high production.
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:20.100]  Digitimes says they will be made available in quote late March.
[01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:22.800]  And so as we record, it's already March 22nd.
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.740]  The event is the 25th next on Monday.
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:29.520]  So presumably that means if, if Digitimes is correct, that's next week.
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:35.080]  But if Digitimes is correct is, is a big gift.
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:39.480]  I have a friend texted me right before we started recording a friend at Apple texted
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:45.440]  me and said, more and more, I see reports from Digitimes and I think, I hope that's
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:49.720]  true, but I know it's, I know it's not, I wish that were true.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:51.120]  Yeah, I wish it were true.
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:54.200]  And like, this isn't somebody who knows whether the air power is shipping or not.
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:58.280]  They're just like, it's, they want it to ship and they're, they're disappointed because
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:02.640]  they feel like Digitimes saying it's going to ship means it won't.
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:06.080]  Well, here's the big question is how much is the thing going to cost?
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:08.680]  Because most of these third party ones are relatively cheap.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:13.200]  They've, and they've really come down in price over the last year.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:17.040]  Like how ridiculous is it going to be if this thing is like a hundred bucks?
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.680]  Well I think, I think a hundred might be viable.
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:26.640]  I think over the net over that will be, yeah, just not, not at all in line with the market.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:27.640]  Right.
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:31.680]  I mean, you know, the backstory on this is that they faced engineering problems with
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:37.040]  these multiple coils to support multiple devices and you know, the, the, you know, you can't
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.240]  have these pads get hot.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:44.320]  They can't, you know, catching fire is bad, you know, and, and presumably, you know, you
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:49.760]  say, why did they pre-announce presumably by, I guess the backstory is somebody, you
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:55.000]  know, whoever makes that decision, whether it's Phil Schiller or Tim Cook or, or some
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  combination of the, you know, executives voting, okay, let's announce it or let's not, not
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.240]  announce it.
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:06.080]  Somebody in engineering on air power obviously convinced them, okay, we haven't solved all
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:11.760]  the problems yet, but we we've got it, you know, like it's, it's, you know, sometimes
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:15.280]  you just, you know, like when you're doing a math problem and it's like, you don't have
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:19.800]  the answer yet, but you know, you, you know, you know how to get the answer and somehow
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:26.480]  they convinced the decision makers, we're not done yet, but we've got it and they obviously
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:27.480]  did.
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:28.480]  Somebody was wrong.
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:31.560]  Well, I mean, that's the thing, like I don't fault engineering for running into issues
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:32.560]  with this.
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:35.760]  I don't, I don't know enough about the air power itself, but like you said, there's,
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:40.880]  there's all sorts of issues with fires and, and, and having enough energy to charge multiple
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:43.540]  devices and, and making it work.
[01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:47.200]  But I, I certainly can question the marketing decision to say, Hey, this thing is coming
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.540]  when no one, no one asked for it.
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:53.060]  And no one would bat an eye if they had never announced this.
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:57.840]  So I think instead they wind up obviously with, with some egg on their face and it'll
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:03.960]  be very interesting to me if this does ship next week, because why not do it this week
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:09.420]  if they're doing this week of hardware and presumably they won't do it at the event itself
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:12.560]  if it really will be a no hardware event.
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:14.280]  There's no way they're going to do it on stage.
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:19.080]  There's, I mean, there's, there's just no way, no, who would, who would want to talk
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:20.360]  about this thing on stage?
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:23.280]  This thing that is months or years late and yeah.
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.280]  Right.
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:27.140]  And then the only thing you would be able to demo are the things they demoed a year
[01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:28.140]  and a half ago.
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:29.140]  Right.
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:30.140]  There's nothing new to it.
[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:31.140]  Sure.
[01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:32.140]  Right.
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:33.140]  The demo is already done.
[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:36.440]  So, you know, the best you can hope for is a press release, I guess.
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:40.480]  I wouldn't be surprised if they do it alongside the AirPods, you know, make maybe when reviewers
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:44.600]  get these new AirPods, they'll get an air power to next week.
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:45.600]  That's an interesting idea.
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.600]  Yeah.
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:52.200]  And then it, because that becomes a sort of, Oh, and by the way, this is ready to, yeah,
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:57.880]  that's my guess is that it'll be a, this is ready to, but they just didn't want to talk
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:58.880]  about it.
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:03.200]  They wanted nothing but good, good stories about Apple this week because the finalies
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:09.080]  will be justified as much as I give all these publications guff over the use of finally
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:15.560]  in, in headlines, you know, when air power does ship or if, if it ships, the finalies
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:19.880]  will be completely justified.
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:23.040]  That's why it's worth complaining about the misuse of finally, because then when there
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:27.040]  actually is a good finally, it takes away from that.
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.040]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:29.040]  Takes away from it.
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.040]  All right.
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.200]  Let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor.
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.200]  I love this.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.200]  This is a great idea.
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:35.960]  I don't know why more people don't do this.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:40.000]  Next sponsor is itself a podcast.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.480]  It's the product breakfast club podcast.
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:48.200]  Have you ever wondered things like how does Lego come up with new product ideas?
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:54.440]  How did Google design Gmail or why Apple's product strategies are almost always misunderstood
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:15:00.360]  by the media product breakfast club is a fun look behind the scenes at the nerdy world
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:05.520]  of product design, tech product management and product strategy with some of the biggest
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:06.920]  names in the product world.
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:12.400]  People like guests have been people like Jason Fried, CEO of Basecamp, good friend of mine,
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:13.400]  Scott Belsky.
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:19.720]  He's VP of product at Adobe, Julie Zhao, VP of product design at Facebook and product
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:25.160]  leaders from all sorts of industries, everything from software to hardware, massive topics,
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.160]  great guests.
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:27.720]  And the show is pure entertainment, very fun.
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:31.280]  They try to keep it fun every episode and it's an easy listen for your commute, your
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:35.440]  workout, anytime you want to listen to podcasts.
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:37.000]  Who hosts the show?
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.320]  Why should you listen?
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:43.480]  Jake Knapp is an ex Googler who invented the design sprint process while working on products
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:45.880]  like Gmail and hangouts.
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:51.120]  The design sprint is now used by every major tech company to validate new product ideas.
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:52.960]  The other host is Jonathan Courtney.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:56.160]  He didn't invent anything, but he runs one of the world's most well-known product design
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:00.280]  firms, AJ and Smart, AJ and Smart.
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:05.160]  So together these two guys have helped companies like Mercedes, New York Times, Google, Adidas,
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:10.100]  even the United Nations bring new products to market.
[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:11.520]  They do not take themselves seriously.
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:13.400]  The show is always meant to make you laugh.
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:14.480]  It's a very fun show.
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:15.760]  I've listened to it.
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:18.760]  They recommend, here's their recommendation for listeners of this show.
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:23.240]  They recommend that you start with episode 47.
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:27.080]  Episode title is Big Product Decisions, Gut Feeling or Test.
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:32.000]  This episode, after much rambling, which I think talk show listeners will appreciate,
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.760]  digs into Apple's unique product design philosophy and why it seems to clash with everything
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:41.300]  people seem to know or think they know about user-centered design.
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:45.800]  Jake and Jonathan are both longtime listeners of this podcast, and they believe Product
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:49.360]  Breakfast Club will feel right at home with your other podcasts.
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:51.160]  I love this idea.
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.720]  So what do you do?
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:54.160]  Grab wherever you get your podcast.
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:59.200]  You can just tap the link in the show notes or you can search for Product Breakfast Club
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:04.120]  in your podcast app of choice, whether that's Apple Podcasts or Overcast or Pocket Casts
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.160]  or Spotify or wherever you listen to podcasts.
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:09.680]  So go listen to Product Breakfast Club.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:13.600]  Episode 47 is the one they recommend.
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:16.220]  I love the idea of a podcast sponsoring a podcast.
[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:21.880]  That certainly makes sense to me, but I'm interested by starting at episode 47.
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:27.760]  That's not advice you usually hear when sometimes maybe skip the first season or something,
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.760]  but 47 is very precise.
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:30.760]  Right.
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:34.800]  It would be like if you told somebody, you know what, you never watch The Sopranos.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:35.800]  Oh my God.
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:40.800]  You got to watch that episode, season three, episode seven.
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:44.760]  Yeah, that would be terrible.
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:45.760]  Oh my God.
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:50.720]  Well, podcasts are very different than serial drama.
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:53.120]  So how about the, we'll go backwards here.
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:55.720]  We can talk about the new iPad.
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:00.480]  I have the, I've been using the iPad Mini all week.
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:03.280]  So they updated the iPad Air and Mini.
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:06.080]  They now have the A12 system on a chip.
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:11.640]  They both have true tone displays, laminated displays, which is the physical process that
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:16.360]  puts the pixels closer to the surface.
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:19.860]  Pretty much every, almost everything state of the art with the displays, with the lack
[01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:26.720]  of, the only thing missing that really is ProMotion, which is Apple's brand name for
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:33.200]  having 120 Hertz refresh rate instead of 60 Hertz, which of all the things that the iPad
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:38.720]  Pro has on their display would be my pick as if you had to leave one off.
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:39.720]  That's what I would do.
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:41.400]  The least important of the features on the chip.
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:42.400]  It is nice.
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:45.520]  I can kind of tell side by side, but when you're actually using it, you don't really
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.520]  see it.
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:52.000]  True tone has been, for me, really painful when I go back to using devices that don't
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  have it.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.800]  Like I've really gotten used to true tone.
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:58.640]  And when you have one, like your phone with it, and then it's like nighttime and you're
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:05.640]  looking at it like an iPad that doesn't have true tone, it just looks so wrong to me.
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:06.640]  What are your thoughts on it?
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:07.640]  What do you use?
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:09.040]  I don't even know if you use an iPad.
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:10.040]  I honestly have no idea.
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:11.040]  Well, it's interesting.
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:14.320]  I read your review of them and I think, I don't want to misquote you or anything, but
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:19.760]  basically you said, if you had to pick an iPad and just from scratch, this, the new
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:21.800]  mini would be your iPad, right?
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:22.800]  Yeah.
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:27.360]  You've got an iPad Pro that you're using and so this won't necessarily replace that, but
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:31.560]  just picking from, starting from Go, you'd start with the mini.
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:34.000]  I've got a bunch of test devices.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.140]  I've got an old, I think I've got the first iPad that had retina, which I think was the
[01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:40.180]  iPad 3.
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:43.220]  That's ancient at this point, but it's still useful for some testing.
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:48.720]  And I've got an iPad mini that I use basically at random.
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:53.040]  During the baseball season, I use it to watch baseball games if I'm, you know, out on the
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:55.040]  deck or something.
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:20:00.760]  But so I, day to day, my iPad sits, I'm looking at it in a cabinet where it's behind a door
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:02.640]  because I don't use it.
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:05.860]  So I, you know, I read this review and I said, okay, that sounds really nice.
[01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:11.760]  And I also like the mini size that's been the iPad that I got the most use out of, but
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:17.640]  I don't have personally any need to purchase it because I just don't use the device frequently
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:20.880]  enough that I should upgrade what I already have.
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:21.880]  Yeah.
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:22.880]  Yeah.
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:30.320]  I'm a, only buy an iPad once every couple of years person, because I just, I just don't
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:31.320]  use it enough.
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:40.880]  And what I do use it for is so, I don't, I don't need like the latest, right.
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:45.800]  And personally, me personally, without going on a long digression about my eyesight, the
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:50.740]  other problem I have with the mini is, is whether it's big enough and trying to make
[01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:56.360]  a very long story short, I, for like two years I needed reading glasses.
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:01.280]  And it's very strange because usually once you need glasses, your eyes don't get better.
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:06.360]  But my, my right eye has actually gotten worse.
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:10.600]  And because it's gotten worse at distance, it's actually gotten better up close.
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:14.900]  And so I've got like this, I forget what they call it by, but it's a, it's a strategy.
[01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:18.520]  Even if you have good eyes, if you have contact lenses, when you get older and you need reading
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:24.720]  glasses, some people will get a contact lens in the one eye that is for distance and the
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:26.400]  other eye for up close.
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:30.680]  And you're, you know, at first it's weird, they say, and then your brain sort of works
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:33.920]  it out and all of a sudden, you know, it just works.
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:40.440]  I've sort of stumbled my way into that strategy where my left eye is, you know, sees 20, 20
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:44.960]  for distance and my right eye does not, but it can see up close without reading glasses
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:45.960]  now.
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:51.920]  So like if I had reviewed this iPad mini a year ago, the same device, I really would
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:55.640]  have needed reading glasses to use, it would have been too small, I would have needed reading
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:57.100]  glasses.
[01:21:57.100 --> 01:22:00.020]  But I sort of needed the reading glasses even with the bigger iPad.
[01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:06.880]  But now in 2019, my eyes have changed and now I can read the mini again without reading
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:07.880]  glasses.
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:10.600]  I really, I used the heck out of it all week.
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:13.840]  That's what I try to always do when I do these reviews.
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:14.840]  But will that change?
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:18.440]  Like, you know, the older I get, the more likely, you know, it's almost certain I'm
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:20.240]  going to need reading glasses again.
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:26.280]  And having a bigger iPad where, you know, one of the interesting things about what they've
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:31.440]  always done with the mini is it's pixel for pixel, the same as a bigger iPhone or iPad,
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:34.440]  they just shrink the pixels and there's more of them per inch.
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:38.580]  It's the same interface, but everything is smaller.
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:44.880]  And so as a mid 40s person rocketing towards needing reading glasses permanently, the bigger
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:46.840]  iPad size is more readable to me.
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:48.000]  So that's just a personal thing.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.660]  But if like five years ago when my eyes were a lot younger and I didn't need reading glasses,
[01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:54.900]  the mini would be my iPad for sure.
[01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:58.560]  But now let me ask you, do you read much on the phone?
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:22:59.560]  I do.
[01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:00.560]  I read a lot on the phone.
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:01.560]  Because the phone's smaller, right?
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:04.240]  I mean, there's, everything on there is smaller.
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:10.400]  So how is that better than, how is the mini potentially too small and the phone isn't?
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:16.000]  Just because it's, when I switch back to the bigger, my 11 inch iPad Pro, it's just, my
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  eyes just feel more relaxed.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  I see.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.360]  It's just the comparison between the two iPads.
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.360]  Right.
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:21.360]  Right.
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:22.360]  I will say this.
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:28.080]  People have been saying for years, you know, is part of the reason the lack of, I mean,
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:32.720]  I think it was three and a half years between iPad mini updates and they've never really
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:39.600]  quite been on like a, you know, it's obviously the odd iPad out.
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:40.600]  Right.
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:43.200]  They're not concerned with making it the top of the line iPad.
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:44.200]  Right.
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:47.520]  And they're not concerned with updating it every year, et cetera.
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:51.760]  But you know, and so people wonder is the iPad, you know, when it, once it goes two
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:56.720]  or three years without an update, people who are iPad mini fans start to worry reasonably
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:02.880]  so that maybe, you know, this is it, they're not going to update it again.
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:08.460]  And part of the thinking behind that is, Hey, phones have gotten so big, you know, has the,
[01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:15.240]  do people who like an iPad mini type thing is, is something like an iPhone XS Max.
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:18.360]  The reason that they don't need a mini.
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:19.360]  Yeah.
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:24.800]  And I would, I find the iPad to be such a different interface and experience and it's,
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:30.360]  even though the mini is obviously the closest iPad to a big phone size, it's so much bigger.
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:31.360]  Right.
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.360]  Right.
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:34.160]  There's no possible way that you could make a phone that big.
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:39.560]  You could not call an eight inch diagonal screen, a phone.
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:40.760]  It wouldn't fit in any pants.
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:44.680]  I don't even think it would fit in Craig Hockenberry's pants.
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:49.200]  Now it's just wondering, I bet Samsung has a phone that's that big that they call a phone.
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:51.640]  I don't want to, I'm not saying you're wrong.
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:58.380]  I think they're wrong, but I think that someone out there is calling a device that big a phone.
[01:24:58.380 --> 01:25:02.460]  You know, it's, it is just, you know, I don't know.
[01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:05.560]  It's just more like, like I said, in my review, it puts the pad in an iPad.
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:10.480]  It just feels like a pad in a way that even a big phone doesn't, I think it's a really
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:11.480]  delightful size.
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:13.160]  I really like it.
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:16.880]  I know it's not their most popular iPad because if it were, they'd, you know, they'd update
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:20.540]  it more frequently, but it's obviously popular enough that they're, they're keeping it around
[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:22.400]  for at least another generation though.
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:23.400]  Yeah.
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:24.400]  Yeah.
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:28.200]  Well, so it sort of makes me wish that they made two minis.
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:31.600]  If they made this one that could start at a $399 price.
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:37.920]  And if they also made an iPad pro mini that had all of the new stuff in the pro, the edge
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:43.600]  to edge display, the pencil to support the better speakers, I mean, I don't know if that,
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:47.760]  that might actually be a problem with the size, you know, the speakers actually take
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:53.240]  up a significant amount of space, well, in theory though, that would, that would be great.
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:55.720]  Well, I mean, this is the same every year.
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:57.080]  I feel the same way about the phone.
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:02.360]  I want a top of the line phone that is smaller than what they're putting out there.
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:04.960]  And they do not want to make that apparently.
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:05.960]  No.
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.840]  Well, I guess not.
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:08.840]  I don't know.
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:11.280]  That would have been another announcement this week.
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:13.600]  It might've just happened.
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.080]  Should we check?
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:20.760]  I should go check and make sure the iPhone SE2 did not come out.
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:22.600]  Well, so you mentioned, you mentioned the pencil.
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:28.200]  I think it's worth touching on that briefly because as I said, this is a weird week.
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:36.120]  And I think it's also really weird that this new, two new iPads use an old Apple pencil.
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:40.240]  And you explained why, and you know, your explanation of why makes sense, but I think
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:46.560]  it's very strange to walk into an Apple store, buy a brand new iPad, and I guess, do the
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:49.720]  shelves now stock both pencils?
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:50.720]  They must.
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:51.720]  They must, right?
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:55.120]  Because the quote old pencil is still a current pencil.
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:57.000]  Yeah.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.960]  And there's, and it's, it is, it's unfortunate.
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:06.480]  I would say it is an unf, and I don't, I certainly don't think they planned it this way.
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:09.240]  I think it's just sort of the way things worked out.
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:17.760]  You know, and there's just no way to get pencil to support on this older device without doing,
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:22.240]  adding X, Y, and Z that all would have made it significantly more expensive, which defeats
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:23.840]  the whole purpose, right?
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:30.480]  Like a big part of this is that the new mini starts at $400 and the new iPad Air starts
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:37.600]  at $500, which is a lot less money than the, the 11 inch iPad Pro, which I think starts
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:40.880]  at $800.
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:44.160]  It's you know, it's, it's not a stretch to say the, you know, the mini is literally half
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:48.560]  the price and the iPad Air is almost only half the price.
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:53.840]  I think, I think, you know, I think unfortunate is definitely the right word, but I, so I,
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:58.800]  I understand why it is this way, but at the same time, it's very strange for Apple to
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:03.960]  be saying, here is a brand new device and use it not with the brand new pencil that
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:06.840]  came out, what, last fall, I think.
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:10.280]  And if you have that pencil for some other reason, it won't, it doesn't even work with
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:11.280]  it.
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:12.280]  Right?
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:13.280]  No, definitely.
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.280]  It does not work.
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:17.360]  Not only, not only can it not charge it, it does not even physically right on the device.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:18.360]  Right.
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:19.360]  Old.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:22.040]  Well, cause you can't pair it right.
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:28.640]  The only way to pair it is with the the inductive charging port on the new iPad Pros.
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:33.840]  And the only way to pair the old pencil is through lightning, like to pair it with a
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:35.720]  new iPad, which is really clever.
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:39.640]  Like I, cause I, I have an old pencil that I've had for a long time with the lightning
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:42.280]  port and just plugged it into the new iPad mini.
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:46.560]  And as soon as I plugged it in, it was like, okay, now, now I'm paired with this iPad,
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:51.840]  but you can't do that with the new iPads because iPad pros, because they don't have lightning.
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:52.840]  Yeah.
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:56.720]  So that, yeah, there's, there's, that's the other question people have is, Hey, how come
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:01.280]  if they moved to USB-C, why didn't these move to USB-C?
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:03.200]  And I think one of the answers is the pencil.
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:04.200]  Right.
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:05.200]  Right.
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:08.880]  So if, if they, if it's needed to pair it and, and to, to sync up with that.
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:09.880]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:10.880]  And to charge it well.
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:11.880]  So it's very strange.
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:16.280]  I mentioned it in my review, I probably should have, uh, one of the nice little things I
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:21.960]  just should add is the, uh, the new iPad mini comes with the 12 watt charger.
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:26.320]  And I believe, I don't remember what the fourth generation mini came with, but I think the
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:30.920]  fourth generation still came with the little tiny phone size five watt charger.
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:34.500]  So at least they're giving you a nice, nice charger with it.
[01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:35.880]  It came with the very smallest one.
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:39.120]  It didn't come with a slightly bigger 10 watt one.
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:43.840]  No, last I remember, I don't know if the fourth generation did, but at least the third generation
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:47.440]  mini still came with the phone charger, the little five little cube looking one that looks
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:49.440]  like a dice die.
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:50.440]  Yeah.
[01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:51.440]  Huh?
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:52.440]  Interesting.
[01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:53.440]  Can't believe I just said a dice.
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:57.480]  What kind of gambler are you, John?
[01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:58.480]  And another point.
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:29:59.480]  Oh, here.
[01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:00.480]  So here's my, here's my thinking.
[01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:03.440]  I, I would like to imagine, so it's all about cost cutting.
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:08.360]  To get these things that minis and errors, right, right.
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:11.000]  So they didn't have to do a new industrial design.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:16.440]  You know, it's the same physical footprint as the old iPad mini and the iPad air looks
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:17.440]  like an older air.
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:22.000]  It doesn't have the edge to edge display with the round corners, which is nicer and, but
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.400]  also more expensive.
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:28.960]  It doesn't have that inductive charging port for the new pencil, which again is more expensive.
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:33.840]  Somebody told me after I published my, my first look at it, that it's definitely that,
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:39.020]  that little charging thing is definitely fairly expensive, you know, like it wasn't going
[01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:43.400]  to make the cut on a $400 device.
[01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:50.560]  Has it doesn't have face ID because it's face ID is more expensive than touch ID sensors.
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:54.160]  So you know, this, that the other thing to get these prices down now, you're stuck with
[01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:57.080]  the old pencil.
[01:30:57.080 --> 01:31:01.720]  I will say, and one of my favorite things about reviewing Apple products, favorite things
[01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:06.320]  to do is use the new thing for a while, like a week or two, and then go back to the old
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:07.320]  thing.
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:14.120]  Like go back to my, you know, if I get a brand new iPhone, use the new review unit for as
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:16.160]  you know, a week or two weeks or something like that.
[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:20.240]  And then go back to my personal one from a year ago and see what I noticed.
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:21.560]  Is there anything slower?
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:26.280]  You know, and in the old, in the original days, like five, six, seven, eight years ago,
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:30.640]  it would always be like, I'd go back to my year old iPhone and typing would always feel
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:31.640]  so slow.
[01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:32.640]  Everything was just slower.
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:36.680]  Yeah, it just was like, wow, this is unbelievable.
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:41.740]  You notice that like you get used to the speed of the faster speed of a new thing and it
[01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:43.040]  just becomes normal.
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:46.000]  And then the way to really tell is to go back to the old thing.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:54.560]  So after having this, the new Apple pencil with my iPad pro since what, October going
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:59.920]  back to the old pencil was really, it really, it feels a little, it almost feels like greasy
[01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:00.920]  in your hand.
[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:01.920]  Right.
[01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:05.160]  You met, you mentioned that and, and it's also round, so it just rolls everywhere.
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:06.160]  Right.
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:10.840]  And, and they, it's weighted, you know, there's some kind of way that it's weighted, so it
[01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:16.880]  supposedly stops rolling and it's a clever design and, uh, but everything that everybody
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:20.920]  ever complained about the pencil, it's all magnified once you're used to the newer pencil
[01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:21.920]  too.
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:22.920]  Right.
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:23.920]  Right.
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:25.200]  And it is definitely better.
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:26.200]  So much better.
[01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:29.320]  It's, it just feels better in every way.
[01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:32.480]  The flat side is so much better to stop rolling.
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:35.240]  The charging is obviously so much better.
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:36.720]  It's certainly more graceful.
[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:42.800]  I mean, it, it, you know, I've never been a hater of the, Hey, stick it in the iPad
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:47.240]  and it looks silly sticking out, but it's there for 15 seconds, right?
[01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:49.360]  It literally needs 15 seconds to charge.
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:52.480]  So yeah, you don't need to do it for, um, likewise.
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:59.640]  I'm not a hater of the, the, the magic mouse with the lightning port that you can't use
[01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:02.400]  while doing it because you don't have to charge it for that long.
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:07.320]  I get it that it's, it's not great, but it would be such a, it would, it, the design
[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:12.320]  doesn't have room for a lightning port on the outside.
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:20.280]  Um, but boy, that old pencil seems, and the other thing is, man, those caps are so fiddly.
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:21.280]  Yeah.
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:22.280]  Ah.
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:27.080]  My, my strategy with the old pencil was always, I don't even know where the actual cap cap
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:28.080]  is.
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:31.760]  Uh, I think I lost it on a train, uh, at one point.
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:35.120]  And yeah, that's what, yeah, now that I think about it, I was on an Amtrak train and it
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:40.280]  fell between the seats and I, I like took out my iPhone, the iPhone flashlight and looked
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:42.320]  down there and it was a nightmare.
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:44.000]  I didn't see it.
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.760]  If I saw it, I might've tried to fish it, fish it out.
[01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:49.040]  But I looked down there and it was so gross.
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:52.360]  Uh, I was like, I was like, that cap is gone.
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:59.400]  But what I usually did is I kept the female to female lightning thing on it as the cap
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:04.600]  so that I could charge it just by plugging it into like a lightning cable.
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:05.600]  Oh, I see.
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:11.000]  And I just used, I used that as a cap and, but it going back to that, like just having
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.880]  a cap, it's so fiddly.
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:16.800]  It just feels like you're constantly at risk of losing this little tiny delicate thing.
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:17.800]  Right.
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:23.440]  And I gotta say that the pencil too is so obviously superior that it's strange to me
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:27.080]  for them to ship a new product that only uses the pencil one.
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:32.320]  And again, we discussed why, but once, once you've made these advances, like touch ID
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:38.280]  is not so much worse than face ID, but the pencil one seems so much worse than the pencil
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:39.280]  too.
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:41.460]  Yeah, it really does.
[01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:43.720]  And so it is, it is like the unfortunate aspect.
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:47.720]  I get why they've done this and it's great that they have pencil support at all because
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:50.920]  the iPad mini didn't have pencil support until now.
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:59.560]  But it is an unfortunate situation, but I don't know how else to say it.
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:00.560]  I think it would be interesting.
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:09.260]  What I think is interesting is to imagine the alternate universe where Apple had decided
[01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:14.360]  it was worthwhile to do the equivalent of a, for the iPad, do what they did with the
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:21.520]  iPhone XR, which is, okay, we're going to make some sacrifices for cost to get us hit
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:28.800]  a significantly lower price point, but let's move these iPads to the new world, right?
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:34.040]  Because the new iPad pros are clearly the equivalent of like the iPhone X for iPad.
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:38.000]  But they only did that in the second year, right?
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.320]  So that's, that's almost what the next, well, I guess these aren't updated every year, so
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:43.760]  that sort of flies in the face of that.
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:47.320]  But that's almost what the next iPad updates should be.
[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:48.960]  Yeah, maybe they will.
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:53.280]  Maybe next year there will be the equivalent of a, you know, the mid range iPad Air and
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:55.560]  iPad mini would be, will be updated.
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:59.240]  But I don't really have faith that they're going to do a mini update in one year.
[01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:02.120]  Like after going three and a half years, I feel like we're looking at like two or three
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:03.120]  years down the road.
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:04.120]  Right.
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:05.320]  No, I think, I think that's probably right.
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:08.160]  But interesting to see what happens there.
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:09.160]  Yeah.
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:13.720]  But it would, you know, I just think it would be so it's just like, and I almost, I don't
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:20.160]  almost feel like the flip side to might, might have proved popular where let's say the iPhone
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:26.240]  10 R didn't exist and they went with like an iPhone nine that looked like the, you know,
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:30.520]  it still had touch ID, like everything that these iPads have, that's, you know, still
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:35.360]  had a rectangular screen without the round corners, still had touch ID, you know, and
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:40.160]  maybe hit an even lower price point, but had the A12 processor and the new camera and stuff
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:41.160]  like that.
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:45.360]  But like I still, I've written about it and I still think, I think it's underappreciated
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:51.480]  that I still feel like there's an awful lot of normal people out there who are not quite
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:58.440]  rational, but just, it's just a natural resistance to not having a home button and touch ID.
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:03.160]  The newer phones just sticking with whatever they, whatever the style is they have.
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:04.160]  Yeah.
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:05.160]  Right.
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:08.120]  I really do feel that because that's how people, that's how regular people think.
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:09.240]  They don't think, Oh, this is cool.
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:11.280]  I can't wait to relearn how I use my phone.
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:12.280]  Right.
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:17.000]  They think, Oh my God, how the hell would I use my phone without a, without a home button?
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:22.080]  And they think, you know, and it's a natural suspicion to think, I don't know, this face
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:24.240]  ID can't possibly work as well as touch ID.
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:30.140]  I love touch ID, you know, so adding, adding touch ID didn't really change anything.
[01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:33.080]  You could still use your phone exactly the same way you used to.
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:34.080]  Right.
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:36.800]  And then if you figured out touch ID, you realized, Oh, this is much better.
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:39.480]  But yeah, switching to face ID is a, is a big difference.
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:40.480]  Yeah.
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:45.840]  And it's, it, it's the amazing aspect of, of, to me, it was just brilliant of making
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:49.760]  the home button, the touch ID sensor instead of putting it on the back, like a lot of Android
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:55.160]  phones do because it, it totally, you, you didn't have to buy into it at all.
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:57.840]  Like it could have been a terrible experience.
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:58.840]  It could be like touch ID.
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:02.960]  It was just awful and you'd be fine because it still worked exactly like your phone iPhone
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:03.960]  did before.
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:04.960]  Right.
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:05.960]  Exactly.
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:10.120]  So you could just put it in and just click the button to make it, make it go.
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:11.600]  I don't know.
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:12.600]  All right.
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:13.600]  I'm, I'm broadcasting.
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:14.600]  Sorry.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:18.680]  I'm recording from a Mac book and I can either have my microphone or power.
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:22.140]  So we're on like a 90 minute clock right now.
[01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:23.140]  Just FYI.
[01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:24.140]  All right.
[01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:25.140]  Let's keep moving then.
[01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:30.000]  So while, while we're, we can, what else is on the agenda here?
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  We got the new IMAX.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.280]  I don't really have much to say about it.
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:35.000]  I was going to say there's, you have this note and it makes perfect sense.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.920]  They announced these, there's some speed bumps, uh, is, was there anything to them that is
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:44.300]  extraordinary the way, you know, the iPads have been really updated.
[01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:48.080]  These are, these are just incremental updates to the iMac, right?
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:52.880]  It's a true speed bump in the traditional sense of the word where the, there's no way,
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:55.360]  you know, the physical form factor is exactly the same.
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:59.560]  The displays are unchanged, but there's, there's no reason to update those displays.
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:01.240]  They're, they're wonderful displays.
[01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:08.040]  Uh, you know, 4k on the 21 inch and 5k on the bigger one.
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:14.880]  It's very hard to find PCs with 5k monitors, um, especially, you know, all in one design
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:18.600]  and the color is wonderful on them.
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:22.040]  Everything's great about them, you know, so they just, you know, they were just overdue.
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:27.360]  I think they were up at like 600 days since the last update, which is, that's my only
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:31.200]  complaint would be, I don't think it's unreasonable for Apple to update.
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:35.560]  Things like the iMac once a year.
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:40.500]  You think it should be, does that sound frequent enough or, or people, people think that it
[01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:42.000]  should be more frequent or less frequent?
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.640]  I think once a year is about right.
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:48.280]  I think that they should, they should update all of the Macs once a year.
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:49.280]  Right.
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:52.640]  As, as, so, so this, this is, you know, worth touching on.
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:57.480]  Last fall when they finally updated the mini and the air, uh, it had been for the mini,
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:02.400]  it had been literally years, uh, since an update and the air had, people thought the
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:08.360]  air was dead and, and now suddenly it's actually probably the best laptop for the most number
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:09.600]  of people.
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:13.820]  Uh, but I don't need that type of update every year.
[01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:17.160]  This type of speed bump where you say, Hey, we're going to charge the same price, but
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:21.300]  you're going to get more functionality out of it than you would have from the version
[01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:22.480]  last year.
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:23.480]  That's great.
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:28.200]  And it doesn't take, I don't want to, you know, dictate Apple's time, but takes a whole
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:30.920]  lot less time than a brand new design does.
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:31.920]  Right.
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:35.720]  Uh, and it seems like at least for a while, up until last year, they had sort of gotten
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:39.080]  away from, uh, doing those updates frequently.
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:43.940]  Uh, so, you know, this, this type of update, I actually really liked to see because they
[01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:44.940]  should do this every year.
[01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:50.140]  And the mini, uh, that was updated last October, this October, Hey, throw a slightly faster
[01:40:50.140 --> 01:40:52.600]  chip in there and charge me the same price.
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:53.600]  Yeah.
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:56.560]  The mini is now SSD only, right?
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:57.560]  The Mac mini.
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:40:58.560]  Uh, yes.
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:04.000]  So this is, I think the, is this the last spinning hard drive they're shipping?
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  Yeah.
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  Yeah.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  So the Mac pro is SSD.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:16.520]  The Mac pros ain't forget the Mac pro we're not counting that the iMac pro is SSD only.
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:21.860]  These new iMacs are the last spinning disks and hopefully the last, this is the last generation
[01:41:21.860 --> 01:41:22.860]  where they will be.
[01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:27.480]  Um, cause that's the big knock on them is that's gotta be, I mean, the only reason for
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:28.480]  that is price.
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:33.080]  The only reason is price and you know, it certainly is easier, you know, they didn't
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:34.320]  really re architect them.
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:36.080]  They're not like a new system architecture.
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:39.880]  The iMac pro truly is, it's not just a name.
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:44.820]  It's not like they just made it dark aluminum and put the pro name on it.
[01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:50.080]  It is truly an entirely different system architecture as an entirely different set of chips that
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:52.200]  uses Intel's Xeon chips.
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:56.640]  It has an entirely different cooling system, um, which is amazing.
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:42:04.920]  Uh, I know Steven Hackett in particular, uh, had replaced a very nice high end iMac like
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:10.400]  the previous generation iMac with an iMac pro just because of fan noise because you
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:14.640]  know, he does a lot of video and I guess probably podcast audio stuff.
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:17.760]  Stuff made his fan run on the iMac and on the iMac pro it doesn't.
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:24.000]  I mean it, it's, I don't own an iMac pro, but I've, I've seen Apple demo it and do really,
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.380]  really stressful stuff and then you get behind it and you don't hear anything.
[01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:30.000]  It's truly an amazing thing.
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:34.720]  These iMacs don't have that, um, and spinning disks.
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:35.720]  I mean they suck.
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:36.720]  I mean they're terrible.
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:37.720]  They're unreliable.
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:38.720]  They're slow.
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:44.920]  Uh, there's, there's, it's, but again, they're also cheap.
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:50.320]  And anybody who says these, I've seen it, you know, people argue, Hey, these are new
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:52.440]  iMacs should be SSD only.
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:56.520]  But if you're going to argue that you also are implicitly arguing that they should, the
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:58.440]  starting price should be significantly higher.
[01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:00.240]  Like you can't have both.
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:05.200]  You can't, you can say your gut feeling is that for, Hey, for 1300 bucks, you should
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:09.960]  be able to get an SSD, but you know, you're, you're spending Tim Cook's money.
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:11.540]  Well there, I'm looking at them right now.
[01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:17.600]  They also all start with one terabyte drives, so I mean, you could definitely put a smaller
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:18.600]  SSD in there.
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:22.800]  The SSD cost goes up with the storage space, obviously.
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:27.680]  Uh, so I, I don't know that everyone who's buying an iMac needs a terabyte drive.
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:34.960]  You could potentially put a, you know, 512 SSD or even a 240, whatever, 240, 480, uh,
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:37.440]  in there and, and have these, these prices.
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:42.840]  Uh, the other, the other thing to note is that SSD prices in the past, like six to 12
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:47.240]  months have crashed, uh, flash memory prices have crashed.
[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:52.040]  So maybe, maybe this is an example, like you said, this is probably, hopefully the last
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:57.200]  ones that have a spinning hard drive and it's potentially something where when they were,
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:44:00.920]  uh, when they were looking to make these, they said, all right, we can do this.
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:06.320]  And then re-engineer the back, you know, the internals of it to, to better support an SSD
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:07.560]  now that they're cheaper.
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:08.560]  Yeah.
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:13.800]  I like, I don't think, I don't think that the iPad pro is going to trickle down.
[01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:18.520]  Like, I don't think they're ever going to sell consumer IMAX with Xeon chip architecture.
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:24.120]  Um, but obviously a lot of the stuff that the iMac pro has should be in the iMac eventually,
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:29.120]  you know, and the other big thing is the T2 probably will be like the T3 or T4 by the
[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:35.640]  time the iMacs get it, but to have like that little iOS secondary chip and secondary chip
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:42.080]  and running all of the security related features, maybe by the time iMacs get this next update,
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:44.320]  maybe there'll be face ID on the Mac.
[01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:46.520]  Uh, that would be cool.
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:50.600]  And now obviously that would go through the T2 subsystem, but who knows, maybe by the
[01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:55.160]  time the iMacs get a major thing, it won't really be a T2 subsystem.
[01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:59.440]  It'll just be an entirely iOS or a ARM based computer.
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:05.240]  Like maybe the main processor will be Apple's ARM thing from the much rumored, you know,
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:08.560]  Apple doing its own chips for the Mac.
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:16.800]  But the one thing I, I, I, I'm 99.9% sure is that Apple has never shipped an iOS computer
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:20.840]  that that touches a spinning hard disk.
[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:26.080]  Um, so like, why doesn't the new iMac have a T2?
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:30.640]  I'm sure there's other reason hard to write, but it's, there's, iOS doesn't have any support
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:34.800]  for spinning hard drives and the T2 needs some kind of boot partition to boot up and
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:37.040]  needs storage.
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:40.680]  So the iMac pro gets it because the iMac pro is SSD only.
[01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:46.400]  So it can have a T2 chip, but, uh, our poor, poor new iMacs still have to, even if you
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:51.280]  get one that's SSD only still, you know, has an architecture that supports spinning hard
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:52.280]  disks.
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:55.120]  Do you ever think about spinning hard disks?
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:59.280]  They're, they're kind of crazy when you think about it.
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:02.480]  Do you remember the original iPod had a spinning hard disk?
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:03.480]  Absolutely.
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:04.480]  For years.
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:09.360]  I mean, a desktop computer having it, okay, it sits there and yeah, it spins, but it's
[01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:10.360]  on its own.
[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:13.200]  The iPod you would walk with, I ran with it.
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.200]  Right.
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:19.400]  You run, you go work out at the gym and you have a crazy spinning hard disk playing music
[01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:20.400]  all the time.
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:22.800]  I mean, I always think of it, you're old enough.
[01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:24.760]  I'm, I'm, you're not really old enough.
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:28.600]  I'm just barely old enough, but you know, I, I recognize a record player when I see
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:33.240]  it and I always sort of think of a spinning hard disk as a obviously shrunk down record
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:34.240]  player.
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:38.800]  And yeah, so to think that there's one of those inside of an iPod is insane.
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:39.800]  Right.
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:45.920]  And that the, the quote unquote slow ones spin at 5,400 rotations per minute.
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:50.680]  Like, like they're spinning at these crazy fast speeds, reading ones and zeros.
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:52.920]  With a tiny little needle.
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:53.920]  Right.
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:55.880]  It's, it's insane when you think about it.
[01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:59.600]  Like it's, you know, but I, I would have to think, I really hope that these would
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:05.080]  be the last, you know, by the time the iMacs get updated again and let's face it, probably
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:06.080]  600 days.
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:07.080]  Oh, maybe not.
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:11.080]  Although maybe, maybe the thing is, is that if Apple does a switch to ARM on the Mac,
[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:14.720]  maybe everything will get an update faster every year or so.
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:15.720]  Yeah.
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:16.720]  Right.
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:19.720]  That's my, that's my other, that's one of my big hopes with the switch to ARM.
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:21.280]  I think we'll get better battery life.
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:23.920]  I have faith that their performance is going to be excellent.
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:27.600]  I mean, our phones already benchmark faster than Mac books.
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:28.600]  It's crazy.
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:29.600]  Right.
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:35.320]  Um, but that it's, you know, maybe it really is Intel's problems hitting their roadmaps
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:38.720]  on a predictable schedule that's keeping Apple from updating these things.
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:43.840]  I mean, I was told off the record, but point blank that the reason the iMac or Mac book
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:52.600]  air took so long to get to this new thing was Intel that, you know, for whatever reason,
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:57.920]  they didn't really have a chip that Apple saw as suitable for this new air design.
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:02.680]  And that's why there's only, there is no like CPU upgrade on the air itself, right?
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:05.960]  You can't, there's no bill to order to get a different, you know, a faster chip or something.
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:10.560]  Intel has one chip that Apple deems usable for the air and it took them a long time to
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:12.120]  get it out.
[01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:17.140]  I mean that there's, I can see something there, but at the same time, something like the mini
[01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:22.180]  where they were selling the same computer for four years with the same chip, there were
[01:48:22.180 --> 01:48:24.980]  faster chips in the interim.
[01:48:24.980 --> 01:48:28.140]  They might not have been that much better, but they were a little faster and a little
[01:48:28.140 --> 01:48:29.360]  more energy efficient.
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:35.320]  And it's not that hard to just slot in a new chip and sell that as an upgrade instead of
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:38.920]  charging the same price for four years for now a four-year-old chip.
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:44.280]  Well, that's the other thing is when they put, I get the strategy, I totally get it,
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:48.800]  but Apple considers these prices as like part of the brand of the device.
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:53.800]  You know, the iMac is a 1299 starting point.
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:56.680]  I mean, the Mac Pro is the most ridiculous one, right?
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:49:01.200]  I mean, the Mac Pro is 10 years old at this point practically, and it's still at the same
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:03.840]  price because they don't want to lower the price because when they do come out with new
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:07.000]  Mac Pros, they want those prices higher price, right?
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.840]  They don't want to say all of a sudden now the Mac Pro, here's a new Mac Pro.
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:13.800]  It's amazing, but it's double the price because they were steadily lowering the price over
[01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:18.200]  the years based on, you know, the reduction in components.
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:20.120]  I mean, who knows what the profit margin is?
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:27.200]  Like if you're, if you had to buy a Mac Pro now, if you're putting about 10% of the price
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:28.200]  value, right?
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:36.040]  Like if you depend on a Mac Pro and you accidentally run it through the washing machine, sure.
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:40.040]  And then putting it in a giant bag of rice doesn't bring it back to life and you need
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:41.040]  to replace it.
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:45.120]  And so you're like, I know this is a bad time to buy one, but I need it.
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:50.200]  You're probably giving Apple insane margins on a Mac Pro today.
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:56.440]  I mean, it's gotta be crazy because I've heard that they don't sell a lot of them, but that
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:50:01.600]  is actually the majority of the company's profit is just Mac Pros.
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:07.560]  They only sell a few, but it's a $3,000 plus machine and they make $3,000 on each one.
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:12.640]  I'm sure that the aluminum is probably the most expensive part.
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:16.540]  It's just, it's just like really just the case is the most expensive thing.
[01:50:16.540 --> 01:50:19.120]  It's crazy.
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:20.120]  But hopefully that would be the point.
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:27.120]  I mean, and you know, they're like the iPhone is certainly, I mean, there's, the iPhone
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:28.120]  makes all the money.
[01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:31.320]  So of course the iPhone is the one that's on the most rigorous schedule, but you know,
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:34.920]  their chip team year in year out does incredibly impressive work.
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:36.920]  They've never had a bad year for the chips.
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:41.960]  There's never been a year where this year is a, you know, whatever is not that much
[01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:42.960]  better.
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:43.960]  Right.
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:47.160]  It's always, even when the phones themselves are like, ah, this one's really sort of a,
[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:52.480]  you know, the, the, just an assier or whatever you want to say, the chips always show like
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:56.200]  a nice improvement, especially in recent years on the GPU front.
[01:50:56.200 --> 01:50:58.560]  So hopefully they could bring that to the Mac.
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:03.900]  Well, and, and I also think there's a profit component there where obviously they're paying
[01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:07.300]  Intel for these chips and then they resell them.
[01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:11.880]  But if you're making the chips yourself, it makes a lot more sense to say every year,
[01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:15.360]  Hey, we've got a new chip, let's, let's upgrade these Macs.
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:20.140]  And there'll be, you know, a speed bump that we can, we can charge for because we're making
[01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:21.440]  all the profit on that.
[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:28.440]  So I certainly have a similar hope if we, if we switch to, to their ARM processors that
[01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:29.960]  we'll see more Mac updates.
[01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:30.960]  Yeah.
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:35.600]  And the other thing too, and I think it's sort of a foreshadowing is that the, the high
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:39.920]  end iPads for years have had like an X behind their name.
[01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:45.920]  You know, there's like the A10X and whatever, but the A12X this year is so much more powerful
[01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:50.600]  and because it has more cores, it's, it's not just like slightly faster than the regular
[01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:51.600]  A12.
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:55.520]  I just, cause I just ran the benchmarks when I was benchmarking these, these iPads, like
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:59.280]  the multi-core stuff is insane.
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:04.040]  So I have total faith that they can walk and chew, that that chip team, Johnny Cerucci's
[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:11.200]  team can walk and chew gum and can design new chips every year for the incredibly power
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:16.540]  conscious phone while at the same time, making incredibly fast ones that, that don't have
[01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:19.920]  to be so power conscious for a Mac laptop.
[01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:23.920]  I mean, I would just take the A12X in a laptop.
[01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:24.920]  Throw it in a laptop.
[01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:25.920]  Yeah.
[01:52:25.920 --> 01:52:26.920]  All right.
[01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:27.920]  Let me take a break.
[01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:28.920]  Last break.
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:31.560]  Thank our last sponsor, our good friends, best friends, honestly, they sponsored the
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:32.560]  show so often.
[01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:33.560]  I love them.
[01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:41.400]  Look, Squarespace is your all-in-one place to host design update.
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:43.360]  Keep going with your website.
[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:44.360]  They do everything.
[01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:46.280]  You can get your domain names at Squarespace.
[01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:50.080]  You pick from a bunch of terrific templates.
[01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:52.000]  As a starting point, you can just use the template.
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.380]  You can design your own thing.
[01:52:53.380 --> 01:52:55.260]  You can take a template and tweak it.
[01:52:55.260 --> 01:53:03.220]  The templates all work from phone size screens up to big 27 inch iMacs that are brand new.
[01:53:03.220 --> 01:53:07.480]  They have analytics built into the platform so you can see where your traffic's coming
[01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:09.360]  from, where people are going.
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:11.080]  You can do things like host a blog.
[01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:14.200]  You can host a podcast, a catalog.
[01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:19.000]  You can do a portfolio if you're like an artist or designer and you want to have a personal
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.600]  website where you show off your work, you can do it on Squarespace.
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:22.600]  Anything.
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:26.640]  If you have an idea for a website, you can do it on Squarespace.
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:30.040]  If you don't have a personal website, you should, and the way you should get started
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:31.840]  is by trying Squarespace.
[01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:35.240]  You get a free trial to start out, build everything.

[01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:12.200]  My thanks to Squarespace for their continuing support of the talk show.
[01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:13.200]  I hear you typing.
[01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:18.520]  I hear your, your, your little Mac book clicking.
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:20.760]  I don't want to speculate too much about next week's event.
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:23.820]  I mean, it's, you know, it'll be what it'll be, but it certainly sounds like there's no
[01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:28.400]  hardware and if there is hardware, it'd be shocking.
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:29.400]  At this point.
[01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:30.400]  Yeah.
[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:31.400]  So what's left?
[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:34.280]  Here's my, the one thing I want to say is everybody is widely acknowledged.
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:39.800]  I mean, there's a bunch of leaks because the news, these people are all, it's not Apple
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:44.120]  that's leaking, it's the partners, but they're going to do a news subscription thing and
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:50.180]  uh, so you, you, you'll pay one fee, maybe it's 10 bucks and you, if you subscribe to
[01:54:50.180 --> 01:54:54.800]  Apple news, you will get subscription content from a whole bunch of publishers who currently
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:59.680]  have, you know, either everything's behind a paywall or they have some paywall content.
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:01.240]  You'll get it all.
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:06.200]  Um, supposedly the New York Times and Washington Post are not in yet, but the w Wall Street
[01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:08.120]  Journal is, which is interesting.
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:11.040]  I'm, I'm a, I forget how many subscriptions I have.
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:16.400]  I pay for the New York Times, I pay for the Wall Street Journal, pay for a couple of smaller
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:20.320]  things, but I also, I am a subscriber to the Washington Post as well.
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:23.240]  Um, for, I forget what I paid.
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:25.420]  Do you, do you subscribe to the Wall Street Journal?
[01:55:25.420 --> 01:55:26.420]  I don't.
[01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:31.480]  The first I know I want to say is either two 99 or three 99 a month because I have that.
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:35.720]  Uh, and then I have Boston Globe, which I don't remember what it is, but the journal,
[01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:38.300]  the journal is the one that I run into.
[01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:42.120]  There are often, not often, but there are often enough that I notice it articles that
[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:43.680]  I think, Oh, I want to check that out.
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:48.720]  And then I hit their paywall and then I either give up on it or I think there's a workaround
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:52.960]  where you can search Twitter and get a link that works at least some of the time.
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:58.040]  And I, that's, that's the paywall that I hit the most that I at least remember.
[01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:03.200]  So that, that's the most interesting one of the possible candidates that are supposedly
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:04.200]  in the service.
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:09.840]  If, if it's 10 bucks a month, it wouldn't take much for it to be worth easily worth
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:10.840]  10 bucks a month.
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:11.840]  Right.
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:15.200]  If you, you know, three, four bucks for this, how much is the journal on its own?
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:20.040]  Uh, it looks here like, uh, I don't know if this is for paper though.
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:26.320]  Um, like, is this, I'm looking at their website says it's $15 a month.
[01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:27.940]  And that's what the 60% off.
[01:56:27.940 --> 01:56:29.960]  That's only good for the next 43 minutes.
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:30.960]  Yeah.
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:32.400]  So I don't know.
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:36.440]  I don't know though, if they're, if they're trying to give me a paper subscription now,
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:40.120]  I, you know, the way these newspapers still want you to, you know, try to trick you into
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:46.220]  getting that, get a physical copy that goes right into your recycling bin.
[01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:47.220]  It's still my favorite.
[01:56:47.220 --> 01:56:51.440]  It's still my favorite story of all, one of my all time favorite I'm, I'm old stories.
[01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:55.120]  I know I've told you this, I know I've told it on the podcast, but it must've been three
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:56.120]  or four years ago.
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:57.120]  It must've been.
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:04.240]  Uh, but I was at Starbucks and, uh, I was waiting for a beverage to be prepared and
[01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:09.880]  there was two young women, you know, college age, maybe, you know, 21, 22 years old talking.
[01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:14.480]  And they had the, I believe it had the Sunday paper, but they had the like Philadelphia
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:21.120]  Inquirer and the one girl was explaining to the other girl that they, you know, she, she
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:25.680]  really was genuine, genuinely unfamiliar with the concept of a newspaper.
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:29.600]  And, and she was saying, and they print this, they do this every day.
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:32.680]  And she said, yes, every single day.
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:36.440]  And the other girl said, why would they do that?
[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:42.960]  I don't think you have told me I almost burst out laughing because on the one hand I do
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:46.280]  kind of feel like you, you're, she's a bit of an idiot, right?
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:49.960]  I mean, there's, how would you, I mean, like you said, record players, like, right.
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:54.400]  You should at least be aware of this, but she's, she's also not wrong, right?
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:59.440]  That's the thing is it, when you think about what is in a printed newspaper every single
[01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:05.480]  day, 365 days a year or a hundred, you know, some of these papers have been around, you
[01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:07.560]  know, a hundred, 150 years.
[01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:08.560]  It's insane.
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:11.080]  It is absolutely insane.
[01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:18.560]  They print out all of the news, whether you want to read it or not, I, you know, but anyway,
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:21.920]  these, these publications still want you to, to get your dead tree version.
[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:22.920]  So I don't know.
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:26.960]  Well, I mean, you do know, you do know the reason why they want that, right?
[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:30.680]  Because it boosts their circulation and they still boost their ad sales, right?
[01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:35.440]  That they're still, they're still selling, you know, they still make a dangerous amount
[01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:40.920]  of their money dangerous in terms of the long-term health of publications, right?
[01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:44.800]  They stay, they're dangerously dependent on print advertising and print advertising goes
[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:45.800]  by circulation.
[01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:49.080]  And so they environment be damned.
[01:58:49.080 --> 01:58:53.760]  They would be, these publications are happy if you have a print subscription that you
[01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:54.760]  never use.
[01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:59.120]  If you just let those newspapers pile up on your porch.
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:02.040]  I mean, something's got to lie in the bird cage, right?
[01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:06.420]  My grandfather, my mom's dad, you know, he died when I was in first grade.
[01:59:06.420 --> 01:59:08.160]  So, but I have very fond memories of him.
[01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:09.800]  He was a very, very nice man.
[01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:10.800]  Very kind.
[01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:14.120]  My little, he was my little pop pop.
[01:59:14.120 --> 01:59:17.600]  He was also, you know, I think the genes are there.
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:24.800]  He was also a bit eccentric and one of his eccentricities was he didn't throw away his
[01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:25.800]  newspapers.
[01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:26.800]  He kept them.
[01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:30.240]  He had like a, like his chair, there was pop pops chair.
[01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:33.680]  That was his, you know, his, his like Barca lounger.
[01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:37.880]  And behind his chair, he, I guess, you know, it wasn't like he kept them for years, but
[01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:43.120]  he'd had months of newspapers at a time and they were, he kept them in mint condition.
[01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:48.120]  Like when he read the newspaper, he was, you know, very carefully refolded it.
[01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:52.240]  And when he was done with the paper of the day, you could brand new stuff that you could
[01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:55.000]  have still sold it at the newsstand.
[01:59:55.000 --> 02:00:00.000]  And so the, the, the stack of them was very neat and they were in, I guess his thinking
[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:04.120]  was if he, if he had thought of it, you know, it was like his version of Google.
[02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:10.400]  Like I read an article a couple of days ago, let me dig through this pile of newspapers.
[02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:12.600]  The stacks were so neat.
[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:16.400]  It's a very vivid memory because you would think it would be a mess, but it really looked
[02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:22.660]  like, uh, as neatly organized as like the, the stack of newspapers at a newsstand to
[02:00:22.660 --> 02:00:25.680]  start a day, you know, where they're all the today's newspaper.
[02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:26.680]  Right?
[02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:31.900]  Well, so, so there, there's two, it's not at all clear what's going to happen next week.
[02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:35.480]  And I don't really like speculating on this stuff either, but there's two different things
[02:00:35.480 --> 02:00:36.600]  that we're talking about.
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:42.640]  This would be a news service that potentially makes sense because there is no real to my
[02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:43.640]  knowledge.
[02:00:43.640 --> 02:00:47.960]  Is there any, there's no major service that says, Hey, give us X amount of dollars and
[02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:52.080]  you'll get access to all the news you could, you could want from the journal, the New York
[02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:56.440]  Times, the post right now, you really have to subscribe to the New York Times.
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:00:59.440]  You subscribe to the wall street journal, you subscribe to the Washington post, you
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:01.880]  give three different payments to three different companies.
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:07.400]  If you want all of the content and, you know, and, and like infamously with the New York
[02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:13.300]  Times, if you want to unsubscribe, you need to call them on the telephone, talk to a friendly
[02:01:13.300 --> 02:01:20.000]  operator in somewhere in Iowa or something like that, uh, it famously very difficult
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.740]  to unsubscribe from the New York Times to get out of that.
[02:01:22.740 --> 02:01:28.000]  But so, so that service, if that service exists and let's just assume it does, that's at least
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:33.220]  interesting depending on the price and depending on what, uh, different papers are included
[02:01:33.220 --> 02:01:34.220]  in there.
[02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:39.640]  Uh, the other one that's, I think getting more publicity is some sort of video movie
[02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:42.480]  TV service, right?
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:49.440]  And this is the one that I, you asked me about it before the show and I, I basically said,
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:56.520]  I don't care because, well, and, and, and for, but for a reason, one, tell me how many
[02:01:56.520 --> 02:01:59.080]  subscription services for TV do you have right now?
[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:00.080]  Too many.
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:01.080]  Right.
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:08.000]  I've got, I've got Netflix, Netflix, I've got HBO through AT&T, so that's actually free
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:09.000]  ish.
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:10.800]  It's paid, you know, indirectly.
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:12.120]  We still have a cable subscription.
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:13.120]  Okay.
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:14.200]  So you still have proper cable.
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:15.640]  So I have proper cable.
[02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:21.800]  I've switched to streaming cable, which saved me a bunch of money, but, uh, I've got Amazon
[02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:23.760]  prime, which gives me prime video.
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:25.200]  I do have that.
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:31.560]  I this year got Hulu for, they had like a $12 for 12 months deal.
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:34.160]  It's the crummy ad version, but I wanted to test it out anyway.
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:39.600]  So I have, I have Hulu and I pay for the, I pay for the ad free version because their
[02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:41.380]  ads are horrible.
[02:02:41.380 --> 02:02:42.380]  They really are.
[02:02:42.380 --> 02:02:47.840]  Uh, so you've got, so just Hulu and Netflix are two services that are effectively the
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:53.840]  same thing and that you're paying a monthly subscription fee for, uh, Netflix, I'm sorry,
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:59.520]  Amazon on top of that, I view that as just coming along for the ride with a prime subscription,
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:05.040]  but already having Netflix and Hulu, what is Apple going to do differently?
[02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:09.440]  I think the only answer is, and the reason that I'm sort of annoyed by this whole thing
[02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:12.240]  is that they're going to have different content.
[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:18.140]  And that I mentioned that, uh, the, the thing that happened with music is that it doesn't
[02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:21.840]  matter what music, music subscription service you subscribe to.
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:23.660]  If you have Apple music, you get all the music.
[02:03:23.660 --> 02:03:25.360]  If you have Spotify, you get all the music.
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:30.400]  Uh, you know, there's a few of them that are at least on par with one another.
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:35.240]  And by and large, you don't need to go to a specific service to get a specific artist.
[02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:39.700]  Uh, title is sort of the exception there where they were trying to have exclusives and things
[02:03:39.700 --> 02:03:40.700]  like that.
[02:03:40.700 --> 02:03:43.240]  But I think a lot of that stuff is temporarily exclusive.
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:46.520]  And then three months later, it shows up on Spotify and Apple music.
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:51.280]  Uh, right now, if you wanted, if you said, Hey, I want to have access to streaming all
[02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:57.440]  these, you'd have to sign up for five or 10 different services to get it.
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:00.040]  And adding yet another service doesn't do anything.
[02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:02.280]  No, it makes the problem worse.
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:07.520]  Uh, well, the rumor is that they are going to bundle it, make it like a TV package, you
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:11.160]  know, where they're going to have a bunch of cable channels and you'll get regular,
[02:04:11.160 --> 02:04:15.600]  what we consider regular TV through this Apple TV subscription thing.
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:18.240]  Uh, like, but what if you don't need that?
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:19.240]  Right?
[02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:20.800]  Like what if you just want to watch Apple's original shows?
[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:26.200]  Do you have to pay and get like, as somebody who still subscribes to cable or you who already
[02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:32.640]  has your YouTube TV, YouTube TV, or if you have like the Sony one, which looks very good.
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:37.080]  If you already have the Sony one, are you told is your only option to give Apple 10
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:41.880]  bucks a month or $15 a month or whatever it's going to cost to get a whole bunch of channels.
[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:46.300]  You already have some other way when all you really want to do is watch the original shows
[02:04:46.300 --> 02:04:47.300]  that Apple's making.
[02:04:47.300 --> 02:04:48.300]  I don't know.
[02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:51.360]  Like, to me, that's the most interesting thing that they'll announce next week.
[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:55.480]  It's not necessarily what, but just how much, how are they going to charge for this?
[02:04:55.480 --> 02:04:56.480]  Right.
[02:04:56.480 --> 02:05:01.600]  And, and yeah, I think there's, there's definitely questions there that I I'll be interested
[02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:08.120]  to see answered, but, uh, I don't see any way in which this will be sort of what Apple
[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:14.280]  music was, or even the iTunes music store was to music where this is the one solution
[02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:15.280]  you need.
[02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:16.280]  Right.
[02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:17.280]  And that's it.
[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:18.280]  Right.
[02:05:18.280 --> 02:05:21.240]  Which is frustrating to me because I don't need to pay for yet another subscription.
[02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:25.440]  I would like to pay more money even for one subscription and just be done with it.
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:26.440]  And just have everything.
[02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:27.840]  I just would just give me everything.
[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:30.480]  I don't think we're going to get that.
[02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:31.480]  Probably not.
[02:05:31.480 --> 02:05:40.480]  Um, uh, last but not least, uh, I want to talk a little bit about, uh, Mac software.
[02:05:40.480 --> 02:05:43.680]  I don't know if you know, do you know anything about the indie Mac software market?
[02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:46.440]  I have a passing knowledge of it.
[02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:47.440]  Yeah.
[02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:51.680]  There was an article that you, I actually saw it, uh, but then I didn't read it either.
[02:05:51.680 --> 02:05:52.680]  But then I read it.
[02:05:52.680 --> 02:05:59.360]  There's a profile of longtime Apple executive, Sean Pruden, who, uh, maybe I wasn't familiar
[02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:01.240]  with her before.
[02:06:01.240 --> 02:06:04.960]  She co-hosted the Apple design awards for years.
[02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:05.960]  Right.
[02:06:05.960 --> 02:06:06.960]  Okay.
[02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:07.960]  Okay.
[02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:09.520]  Um, that's probably where she's best known outside the company.
[02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:11.440]  Um, it's interesting profile.
[02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:13.560]  She's been an Apple for 30 years.
[02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:18.560]  But there's a part of the art, that part of the article that caught your attention and
[02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:22.800]  caught mine too, was, uh, I don't know if I want to paraphrase or if I should just read
[02:06:22.800 --> 02:06:23.800]  it.
[02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:28.600]  Uh, I guess I should try to, I'm trying to find it in the article, but now I don't know.
[02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:29.600]  Yeah.
[02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:33.320]  Um, and you know, she works for the app store.
[02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:34.960]  Um, but here's the quote.
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:37.860]  She says, I don't know if you re I don't know if you remember, but the way you used to buy
[02:06:37.860 --> 02:06:40.280]  software was in a box at a store.
[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:44.360]  There was no way you could come up with an idea for an app and create it and put it in
[02:06:44.360 --> 02:06:46.540]  a shiny disc and sell it yourself.
[02:06:46.540 --> 02:06:47.980]  It just wasn't going to happen.
[02:06:47.980 --> 02:06:55.960]  So the app store really democratized software and it has democratized software, but there's
[02:06:55.960 --> 02:07:00.600]  an entire still thriving business.
[02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:06.880]  It's almost like she's forgetting something and I can't quite put my finger on it.
[02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:11.800]  It's like you went from retail stores and selling software and then, and then the app
[02:07:11.800 --> 02:07:17.640]  store and it's, was that, was there something called the web in between their job?
[02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:20.560]  So when, when did, when was rogue amoebas started?
[02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:24.560]  Uh, I believe it's the same year as daring fireball, 2002, 2002.
[02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:29.320]  Uh, and you guys have never put software on a, in a box.
[02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:32.680]  Have you, uh, we have never needed to early on.
[02:07:32.680 --> 02:07:37.200]  There were a couple of bundles that other companies made that we put audio hijack in
[02:07:37.200 --> 02:07:44.080]  briefly, but it was, it was basically a flirtation because growing up getting software in a box
[02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:48.160]  was something to aspire to maybe, or, you know, that's how you bought software as she
[02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:49.160]  said.
[02:07:49.160 --> 02:07:55.120]  Uh, but yeah, so essentially no, our software has for 16, 17 years been sold online exclusively.
[02:07:55.120 --> 02:08:00.480]  Uh, you enter your credit card number, you download the software from our website and
[02:08:00.480 --> 02:08:04.040]  you get a license key in the, in an email and you unlock it that way.
[02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:05.040]  Yeah.
[02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:06.040]  Yeah.
[02:08:06.040 --> 02:08:12.680]  And again, I'm not slagging on the app store and certainly it certainly made writing software
[02:08:12.680 --> 02:08:16.880]  for phones, a democratized thing prior to the iPhone.
[02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:20.800]  The idea that in, you know, one person or a two person team or something like that would
[02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:23.080]  write phone, phone software was crazy.
[02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:25.840]  I mean, it was, it just wasn't through the carriers.
[02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:27.200]  You had to be a big business to do it.
[02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:29.360]  That's a, that's a hundred percent true, right?
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:33.920]  But in terms of software in general, and especially for the Mac and even for windows for just
[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:40.920]  for personal, we call PCs, uh, that democratization was the web did it, the web absolutely did
[02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:41.920]  it.
[02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:46.640]  And so we said 2002 for when our company started, I was selling software online for about four
[02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:48.880]  years before that with other companies.
[02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:53.680]  And we, you know, have talked to plenty of people about the mid nineties, maybe even
[02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:58.680]  mid to late nineties is when you could start having a web only piece of software that could
[02:08:58.680 --> 02:08:59.680]  make real money.
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:00.680]  Right.
[02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:05.080]  Enough money to support a business and support actual employees with a real wage and stuff
[02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:06.080]  like that.
[02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:07.960]  And that's a decade before the app store.
[02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:11.960]  And it meant you didn't need to put anything physical in a store, physical store.
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:17.800]  And uh, so yeah, to, to sort of skip over this and then, uh, I'm pretty sure, uh, Phil
[02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:22.400]  Schiller was on the talk show, sorry, on, uh, ATP and I think he made a very similar
[02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:26.440]  point that, you know, maybe as a talking point for them, obviously, uh, that again, sort
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:31.680]  of skipped over the idea that, Hey, there was a way to do this after retail stores and
[02:09:31.680 --> 02:09:33.680]  before the app store.
[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:34.680]  Hmm.
[02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:38.160]  Uh, it's, I get it.
[02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:42.480]  I do get that they want to promote the app store, but it's such a huge omission.
[02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:45.960]  It's just, I mean, and it's still going strong, right?
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:51.880]  I mean, our stuff is almost all of it is exclusively sold directly from our website.
[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:52.880]  Right.
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:55.800]  And, uh, you know, it's still a great way to run a business.
[02:09:55.800 --> 02:10:02.200]  I mean, we, you and I know a lot of fellow indie Mac developers, um, you know, we can
[02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:06.520]  do an entire two hour episode of the show just on the app store, but you know, in the
[02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:10.760]  app store is what it is, but it's nowhere near as big, important for the Mac as it is
[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:11.940]  for the iPhone.
[02:10:11.940 --> 02:10:18.320]  And most of the indie developers I know, the either aren't in that Mac app store or if
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:23.640]  they are there, they sell apps that are also available, also available directly.
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:24.640]  Right.
[02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:27.400]  And it, it avoids that 30% tax.
[02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:35.240]  It avoids the, um, uh, the review process it, uh, you know, the sandboxing rule, certain
[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:42.640]  out certainly some of Roga Mepa's apps are, would be difficult to sandbox.
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:44.640]  Difficult is, is putting it very kindly.
[02:10:44.640 --> 02:10:45.640]  Yes.
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:53.160]  Uh, I'm not quite sure how audio hijack would work in a sandbox world other than not at
[02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:54.160]  all.
[02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:55.160]  That's not right.
[02:10:55.160 --> 02:10:56.160]  Yeah.
[02:10:56.160 --> 02:10:59.200]  Uh, but it, you know, and it just keeps you independent.
[02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:03.200]  It puts the independent, you know, the independent and independent developer that you're not,
[02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:06.800]  you know, you're just everything, you know, you want to do a software update, here's the
[02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:07.800]  software update.
[02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:08.800]  Right.
[02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:09.800]  You know?
[02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:14.380]  Well, can I, can I use this as, as my, my chance to shills briefly?
[02:11:14.380 --> 02:11:18.020]  Of course that that's exactly what I was going to segue to.
[02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:22.040]  So, uh, you asked me to be on the show literally just yesterday.
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:25.120]  I think you had a cancellation and I'm, I'm the fallback.
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:26.120]  I'm okay with that.
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:27.120]  Molt's canceled.
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:36.100]  Oh, wait a minute, no, wait, I will, I refuse to be below Molt's, uh, but no, it, it, uh,
[02:11:36.100 --> 02:11:42.080]  it was slightly unfortunate timing because we're looking to push out a very, uh, widely
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:46.880]  focused, broadly focused product, a brand new product next week.
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:51.680]  And uh, so this morning I put up a teaser post on our blog.
[02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:56.480]  So if people are interested to see what our news is next week, they should check out,
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:12:02.560]  uh, macaudio.com and click over to our blog and they'll be able to, uh, sign up to get
[02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:04.420]  information on this when it comes out next week.
[02:12:04.420 --> 02:12:08.020]  So we have, we have, we have a product that is hopefully coming out next week that absolutely
[02:12:08.020 --> 02:12:13.120]  would not fit in the app store and could not be sandboxed, but, uh, should appeal to just
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:18.480]  about anybody doing anything with audio on their Mac, uh, even listening to Apple music
[02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:19.480]  or Spotify.
[02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:20.480]  That's very clever of you.
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:24.400]  I realized when you said that yesterday that timing wise doesn't, it didn't really work
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:26.680]  out for you, but doing a teaser does.
[02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:31.640]  No, I, I, I, we're not big on teasers, uh, but, uh, I'll, I'll take the opportunity to
[02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:33.120]  do it once in a while.
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:34.120]  Yeah.
[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:36.640]  Um, well my thanks for you joining.
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:39.520]  Hey, what about, uh, you doing anything on June 4th?
[02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:44.200]  Uh, June 4th, uh, there's some sort of show, I think.
[02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:45.200]  Yeah.
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:46.200]  You're going to announce it.
[02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:47.760]  I, I I'm there for you, buddy.
[02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:52.360]  It's been a long time since you've been a regular guest on the show, right?
[02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:55.160]  Uh, maybe last year, but, uh, we, we don't do it.
[02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:57.040]  We don't do it terribly regularly.
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:13:01.680]  How often, how many times have you been the announcer for the talk show live at WWDC?
[02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:03.440]  Ooh, I could look it up.
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:06.240]  Uh, at least five, maybe five or six.
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:11.800]  Because it goes back to the, uh, uh, the days in San Francisco, mezzanine in San Francisco
[02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:12.800]  multiple years.
[02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:13.800]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:14.800]  Yeah.
[02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:15.800]  You've got that voice.
[02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:17.200]  You've got that announcing voice down pat.
[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:18.680]  And the face for it as well.
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:19.680]  Exactly.
[02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:22.400]  No, there, so I don't have any tickets to announce.
[02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:23.400]  I know people want it.
[02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:24.800]  I, I will try to get them out soon.
[02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:27.240]  Uh, I know that they sell out very quickly.
[02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:30.080]  Uh, but there will- But you do have the date, you have everything
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:31.080]  pinned down, right?
[02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:32.080]  I do.
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:37.480]  The talk show live will be Tuesday, June 4th at, uh, once again from the, the lovely,
[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:40.600]  uh, California theater in San Jose.
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:42.000]  Beautiful, beautiful theater.
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:43.880]  Uh, very excited about it.
[02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:46.800]  Uh, don't have any guests lined up yet.
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:49.680]  Still working on that and I'll work on ticketing, but, uh, stay tuned.
[02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:50.840]  I'm not quite sure how to do it.
[02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:54.840]  I know it's, I don't know if, I don't know how to run a lottery.
[02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:58.560]  It seems like that would be a fair way to do it, but, but we'll see.
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:13:59.560]  But anyway, stay tuned.
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:00.560]  Save the date.
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:04.120]  Uh, and, uh, I look forward to seeing you there, Paul.
[02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:08.160]  Well, and, and if your guest falls through there, then it might just be you and me talking
[02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:09.160]  on stage.
[02:14:09.160 --> 02:14:10.160]  Exactly right.
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:14.200]  So, you know, keeps, keeps- I will literally be waiting in the wings.
[02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:17.200]  So you will.
