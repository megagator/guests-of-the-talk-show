[00:00.000 --> 00:07.360]  Alright back to this is the worst episode ever. It's gonna be four hours long. Well, no, I'm gonna wrap it up soon
[00:09.380 --> 00:11.380]  But it's summertime I need long episodes
[00:13.060 --> 00:16.320]  You know, didn't I do a two-parter with you last time yeah son, yeah
[00:16.320 --> 00:20.660]  I think we're incapable of making one that's under two hours. Oh, well, maybe we'll do that again
[00:20.660 --> 00:23.980]  I wanted to talk about custom fonts in conch in
[00:24.820 --> 00:27.260]  Overcast and you're using a font called concourse
[00:27.260 --> 00:29.620]  by Matthew
[00:30.940 --> 00:38.300]  Butterick, yep. Love it. Great font face. I remember talking to you about this font. Oh my god might have been a year ago. I
[00:39.980 --> 00:45.660]  Remember you just like running it up the flagpole like hey, what do you think about this?
[00:46.100 --> 00:48.100]  And I was like, oh my god, that is beautiful
[00:49.420 --> 00:52.180]  Yeah, I went about about last summer. Yeah about a year ago
[00:52.180 --> 00:58.120]  I was looking at tons of fonts for overcast looking at various interface fonts with instapaper
[00:58.120 --> 01:02.880]  I was all using I was using almost all serif fonts for all the reading faces
[01:03.320 --> 01:05.460]  There were some sans-serif ones that were more popular
[01:05.460 --> 01:09.680]  But I always like the serif ones better when they were large like on an iPad and everything
[01:09.680 --> 01:15.720]  It felt like serif was somehow the proper solution for you know, reading text
[01:15.720 --> 01:18.360]  It should be in serifs because serifs are old and fancy
[01:18.360 --> 01:24.920]  And they feel more like print. Yeah, exactly. I kind of got burnt out on them though and
[01:26.040 --> 01:28.880]  Whenever I would do I would design something with a serif font. I
[01:29.600 --> 01:34.360]  would always think it should look better, but then it didn't actually look better and
[01:34.800 --> 01:40.160]  It didn't work as well on screens or it looked good big but not small or something like that. Like there was
[01:41.040 --> 01:43.040]  There were problems with serifs
[01:43.400 --> 01:47.640]  In practice, so I burned out on them. So I was looking at good sans-serif interface fonts
[01:47.640 --> 01:51.200]  for overcast and the and one of the problems with sans-serifs is that
[01:52.360 --> 01:58.880]  There aren't that many distinct styles that are generalizable to look good enough in an interface as an interface font
[02:00.480 --> 02:04.040]  Maybe this is a terrible statement, but that's that's how I see them. No, I think it's true
[02:04.680 --> 02:09.840]  well, and I I also think that and can on another end of it is
[02:10.360 --> 02:15.980]  There's an awful lot of them that are all that are really good fonts really good fonts that I like
[02:15.980 --> 02:22.900]  But they're too close to Helvetica to justify not using Helvetica. It's like an uncanny valley situation
[02:23.780 --> 02:27.180]  specifically given iOS like in the general
[02:27.700 --> 02:34.420]  World if you want to use Franklin Gothic instead or you want to use universe
[02:34.420 --> 02:37.700]  Which is a great great Helvetica ish font
[02:38.580 --> 02:40.580]  great fantastic font
[02:41.100 --> 02:43.420]  but in the context of iOS where
[02:43.420 --> 02:45.420]  Helvetica is the ubiquitous
[02:46.260 --> 02:52.220]  Ever present default if you're gonna use something different. It should be different enough that it's oh, yeah. It's a different font
[02:52.740 --> 02:58.620]  Exactly, I mean there's an awful lot that it ruled out on those grounds exactly and and yeah
[02:58.620 --> 03:00.620]  I mean I I looked at tons of fonts
[03:01.100 --> 03:06.020]  From big and small foundries and designers and I had that problem with many of them that it was like, you know
[03:06.020 --> 03:11.460]  This is just too close to Helvetica and just looks kind of weird not being Helvetica if it's this close. Yeah
[03:11.460 --> 03:16.180]  So I looked at a bunch what what I liked about concourse
[03:17.220 --> 03:20.860]  The most was that it was narrow
[03:21.620 --> 03:23.940]  And and not by it not by a massive amount
[03:23.940 --> 03:29.220]  It doesn't look like a condensed version of a font like a lot of these fonts would have condensed variants or even
[03:29.420 --> 03:33.020]  Compressed for like the super condensed very convinced very condensed ultra narrow or whatever
[03:33.620 --> 03:35.620]  and and
[03:35.620 --> 03:43.500]  And concourse is narrower without looking like a narrow font and what that allowed me to do is fit more
[03:44.420 --> 03:46.420]  characters on a line and
[03:46.940 --> 03:49.900]  For it for an app that I knew is gonna be used primarily on iPhones
[03:50.380 --> 03:53.580]  Where I had to display lots of like one-line titles for things
[03:53.900 --> 03:59.060]  that is actually a really nice feature to have right because then it makes it a little bit less likely that you're gonna have to
[03:59.060 --> 04:01.020]  Put ellipses in there and truncate it
[04:01.020 --> 04:05.780]  Okay, and even if you do you'll at least get more a little bit more of the actual title in right
[04:05.780 --> 04:07.780]  I'll at least get like one or two more words out of it
[04:08.220 --> 04:11.460]  and and it had a it had a great balance on screen of
[04:11.980 --> 04:19.300]  Size versus weight and it came in it comes in like nine different weights and it also has this awesome small caps variant
[04:19.300 --> 04:24.820]  Yeah, which I think is used. It's a great effect. Yeah, that's one of my favorite little things in concourse
[04:25.180 --> 04:27.180]  Yes, says the guy who?
[04:27.700 --> 04:29.700]  Got a small caps
[04:29.700 --> 04:33.320]  I've optioned into an app that you know protects everything
[04:33.720 --> 04:38.800]  I always like your small caps titles. No, I mean like it and and that gave me like the the pairing of
[04:39.520 --> 04:41.520]  of like, you know full
[04:41.940 --> 04:48.920]  full regular text as like, you know medium medium weight regular text as like a body and title font and then a
[04:49.440 --> 04:50.700]  thinner
[04:50.700 --> 04:52.960]  usually lighter in color small caps font
[04:53.200 --> 04:59.120]  For like a caption font or like a subtitle and then using it on the buttons and and the links like that
[04:59.120 --> 05:03.520]  I I found that combination early on and I liked it so much and yes
[05:03.520 --> 05:05.640]  it works so well for an interface to have like
[05:05.880 --> 05:11.240]  That like that like to dip the two different styles that can serve those two different roles and have them paired nicely on screen together
[05:11.360 --> 05:17.120]  Yeah, I think it works. You know, it it fits naturally with what is clearly your
[05:17.800 --> 05:19.600]  taste in
[05:19.600 --> 05:25.520]  Interfaces, you know and your personal style and I think you know and I think you'll probably agree with me that iOS 7
[05:25.800 --> 05:27.800]  Has been very good
[05:27.800 --> 05:29.400]  for you
[05:29.400 --> 05:34.960]  personally as an app developer who does the whole thing yourself for the most part and and
[05:36.320 --> 05:40.840]  Cover that asterisk in a one quick second, but you're like a one
[05:41.760 --> 05:46.760]  one-man show you did the development did the back end and you didn't eat the interface and
[05:47.440 --> 05:50.120]  You know the the some of the stuff that was
[05:51.060 --> 05:55.440]  Expected pre ios 7 in an app was things that you couldn't do
[05:55.440 --> 06:01.440]  You know the stuff that it has to be done like in Photoshop, right textures and materials stuff like that
[06:01.440 --> 06:03.680]  I I am NOT a graphical artist
[06:03.800 --> 06:06.360]  Alright, and so I could not do those things insta paper
[06:06.360 --> 06:12.540]  maybe got away with it and was a good app for you to do with your your abilities as a designer because it was so
[06:12.540 --> 06:18.960]  You know literally just the text it was all about the text, but there's other ways where maybe insta paper circa
[06:20.600 --> 06:22.340]  You know
[06:22.340 --> 06:26.520]  2009 2010 maybe should have not in a while you're reading
[06:26.520 --> 06:30.960]  But while you weren't reading should have had more visual oomph to fit in exactly
[06:32.480 --> 06:37.120]  Whereas ios 7 really plays into the like the skill sets that you have
[06:37.520 --> 06:38.020]  Yeah
[06:38.020 --> 06:45.760]  I mean I ios 7 was extremely lucky for me because like this the shift happened that that departed from all the things
[06:45.760 --> 06:52.200]  I couldn't do myself all these like heavily textured heavily graphically themed apps from from six and earlier
[06:52.680 --> 06:55.480]  Although even by six it was fading out. So really from five and earlier
[06:56.520 --> 06:58.960]  All of that went out of style it very quickly
[06:59.600 --> 07:05.560]  and and then what was brought in was this this visual language that I could do myself and
[07:06.040 --> 07:09.600]  I was not expecting that at all. I was very very happy about that
[07:09.600 --> 07:15.200]  Because you know, otherwise like the magazine I designed with a lot of help from Pacific Helm
[07:16.960 --> 07:23.180]  And the magazine was a very simple app and and I mean the design work, you know numbered in the thousands of dollars
[07:23.700 --> 07:25.700]  To have a professional designer
[07:26.040 --> 07:28.480]  Helped me on overcast would have been
[07:29.280 --> 07:32.760]  probably easily tens of thousands of dollars worth of design work and
[07:34.320 --> 07:36.320]  It also would have taken longer
[07:36.320 --> 07:40.060]  So, you know would have been more expensive and then I would have had to I would have had to keep going back and forth
[07:40.060 --> 07:45.500]  With the designer to work out some of these things and the whole process would have been more complicated more expensive
[07:45.920 --> 07:50.420]  longer, you know, it just would have been harder for me and and
[07:51.080 --> 07:56.600]  To be able to do it all myself is so valuable because I can tweak things immediately
[07:56.600 --> 07:59.300]  I can I can visualize something in my head and just do it
[07:59.300 --> 08:01.740]  I can see how things look I can play with it
[08:02.140 --> 08:05.740]  And then I can do it all myself and it all cost me nothing except my own time
[08:05.740 --> 08:08.420]  Which I'm already, you know kind of getting for free in a way
[08:09.340 --> 08:12.780]  And just suit your personality. I think clearly it does, you know
[08:12.780 --> 08:17.220]  like one of the reasons why I never went the whole like full textured iOS 5 app route is
[08:17.540 --> 08:20.140]  That that wasn't really my thing. I wasn't my style
[08:20.140 --> 08:24.020]  like I would use the apps that did that but I was never that into that style whereas
[08:24.620 --> 08:31.340]  This style this is really me. This is and it's just it just so happens that what I like and what I can do
[08:32.020 --> 08:34.020]  Just became fashionable a year ago
[08:34.020 --> 08:40.460]  Yeah, the one thing you did get help on and here's my asterisk from a couple seconds ago was the app icon, right?
[08:40.500 --> 08:47.820]  Right and that logo shape the the the tower inside the circles and Leah that was all Louis Mantia right at Pacific Helm
[08:47.820 --> 08:49.820]  Yeah, or not. Yeah
[08:49.820 --> 08:57.020]  Yep, Pacific Helm Louis Mantia. Yeah. Yeah, and it's great. I love the icon. I know that the icons are
[08:57.020 --> 09:03.540]  Our God everybody will have an opinion on an icon and I'm hiring from all of them
[09:03.540 --> 09:07.660]  I'm that this was this was my question is to me
[09:08.140 --> 09:14.820]  This is such a great icon and it does everything an icon should do where it's recognizable. It's
[09:15.700 --> 09:19.900]  Distinctive, it's it gives it a brand. It does all these nice things
[09:19.900 --> 09:26.940]  I happen to also think that it's just an attractive shade of orange. I like it. I've always been a fan of orange if
[09:27.860 --> 09:30.040]  Ever there was an icon that might be
[09:30.780 --> 09:37.360]  Beyond, you know, oh this icon sucks. Maybe this was it but you're saying it's not it does not
[09:38.140 --> 09:41.460]  Okay, most people love it. However, I'm hearing from all the ones who don't
[09:41.980 --> 09:44.760]  I'm not here for people who do which is why I know that most people love it
[09:45.460 --> 09:47.980]  but there's there's a handful of people who are like
[09:47.980 --> 09:50.860]  extremely offended by it like I I
[09:51.860 --> 09:58.100]  You know, I'm not to get all Ben Brooks on you, but I like I've never cared about icons that strongly like yeah
[09:58.100 --> 10:00.820]  I mean, I'll I will notice a bad icon for an app
[10:00.820 --> 10:05.260]  But I'm not gonna like make my usage decision based on which one has the best icon
[10:05.620 --> 10:09.780]  Like that's I don't like I I would rather have a good app even if the icons awful
[10:09.780 --> 10:17.220]  I think people people who have opinions on apps in general and just want to express their opinions will often I
[10:17.220 --> 10:19.460]  icons the app icon gets a
[10:20.060 --> 10:23.460]  Disproportionate share of that feedback, right?
[10:23.460 --> 10:25.600]  Like you said it's because it's not it probably is
[10:25.820 --> 10:31.560]  Like if you had really had to use a beautiful great app that had what you thought was a lousy icon
[10:31.560 --> 10:35.780]  It's like well, that's the best problem I could have with this app, right? It's like yeah exactly
[10:36.220 --> 10:38.900]  You know, or it's like if the app has a bad name
[10:38.900 --> 10:46.460]  You know, it's like, okay. Well, yeah, you can control that a little bit but who cares really? Yeah, it's you know
[10:46.460 --> 10:51.820]  Ideally, you know, we have a great name and a memorable name and you know, but if it has a lousy name who cares
[10:52.700 --> 10:56.700]  It just seems like it's so much better than having deep problems with the software itself
[10:56.780 --> 11:01.180]  but yet icons get all this feedback and I think it's because it's just so
[11:01.860 --> 11:06.980]  Neatly encapsulated and so petty that it just draws, you know
[11:06.980 --> 11:08.980]  it's like the old adage about
[11:13.600 --> 11:14.840]  Politics in
[11:14.840 --> 11:21.520]  college universities like Woodrow Wilson was you know always said that being president United States was easier than being president of Princeton because
[11:22.520 --> 11:26.740]  The politics there was just so meaningless that made it made it up. It was worse
[11:28.100 --> 11:35.880]  Something like that and the icon here like I I almost didn't use this icon. I went back and forth and and
[11:35.880 --> 11:37.120]  I
[11:37.120 --> 11:39.120]  think it's easy to
[11:39.320 --> 11:45.320]  It's easy for people to get angry at modern app icons for iOS 7 because iOS 7
[11:46.240 --> 11:49.200]  totally changed what icons are supposed to look like and
[11:50.360 --> 11:54.600]  The new style is much more polarizing than the old style ever was
[11:54.720 --> 12:01.760]  yeah, and so the new style a lot of the rigs that you get for a new app icon is rage against the iOS 7 general
[12:01.760 --> 12:03.760]  aesthetic for icons and
[12:03.760 --> 12:06.960]  What this icon did thanks to Louie
[12:07.760 --> 12:12.400]  Because you know Louie is is is one of those people who like he he knows
[12:13.240 --> 12:18.360]  which rules to break and when to break them and and and that's unusual and
[12:19.120 --> 12:20.640]  It's one of things that makes me a designer
[12:20.640 --> 12:24.800]  I actually think that it could have it would translate very well to the old world
[12:24.800 --> 12:29.440]  Like if you if we took this app back in time two years, you'd have to redo the whole app interface
[12:29.440 --> 12:36.560]  but you could use this icon and exactly, you know, just a little bit of 3d shading around the edges or something like that, but
[12:37.400 --> 12:38.320]  Exactly. Yeah
[12:38.320 --> 12:43.400]  and I like this icon like what I like about like Louie was really was interested about using the white as
[12:43.560 --> 12:49.480]  the inner color as that circle at the inner color and then having this black outline that like goes into the shape like
[12:49.840 --> 12:53.120]  It's most iOS 7 icons have like
[12:53.880 --> 12:55.880]  one fewer color
[12:56.080 --> 12:57.240]  basically
[12:57.240 --> 13:02.320]  Right and and this like Louie Louie tried this out and I'm like, you know that actually looks really nice now
[13:02.320 --> 13:07.760]  I wanted to go even further at first if you look at the the overcast FM Twitter account
[13:08.440 --> 13:10.440]  that artwork is
[13:10.800 --> 13:17.680]  I asked Louie to take this icon and make something that might make a good like podcast album art background
[13:17.680 --> 13:21.440]  so I could maybe show it as the default album art for something that didn't have art and
[13:22.040 --> 13:24.040]  I liked it so much that
[13:24.040 --> 13:30.040]  For a while and for beta 1 this was the app icon and you guys all hated it
[13:30.040 --> 13:35.920]  And then and you convinced me not to use it. That's fine. But but like I even like I like doing things that are
[13:37.080 --> 13:42.640]  mostly conforming to style so it looks good, but just like poking someone in the ribs a bit with some part of it because
[13:43.160 --> 13:45.160]  oftentimes that's what makes it good and
[13:45.760 --> 13:51.700]  So like, you know Louie did it with like having the white inner color and having this black outline around around the inner shape. I
[13:51.700 --> 13:53.660]  I would have
[13:53.660 --> 13:58.140]  pushed it even further if I was totally unchecked by reason and logic and then you know
[13:58.140 --> 14:01.800]  I trust why I tried this like fiery textured version of the background a little bit
[14:02.220 --> 14:07.360]  In the background or I mean as the beta one icon and and everyone hated except me
[14:07.360 --> 14:11.220]  And so I changed it back to this and I was like, you know, okay, actually you're right. This does look better having been
[14:11.220 --> 14:15.460]  I don't think hate hates not fair. I think it was just every everybody was just like I
[14:16.020 --> 14:19.700]  Think everybody was just like no you're not the other one's better. Trust me
[14:19.700 --> 14:26.220]  I mean like this is like I I work best in an environment like that where I am able to try crazy things
[14:26.620 --> 14:30.980]  But I have some people who can like edit me a little bit and say you know what actually, you know
[14:30.980 --> 14:32.380]  That that's a little bit far
[14:32.380 --> 14:37.460]  you gotta pick your battles and I think part of what makes somebody a good beta tester is whether they know how to pick their
[14:37.460 --> 14:41.980]  Battles and therefore in other words that that they're only gonna be adamant about things
[14:41.980 --> 14:48.020]  They genuinely feel adamant about and they're gonna they'll they'll offer suggestions or I wish hey
[14:48.020 --> 14:51.860]  I wish this were like this but if they don't feel that strongly about it and you disagree
[14:51.860 --> 14:56.020]  They just let it go and they'll but they'll and they won't give up though and they'll keep sending that feedback
[14:56.660 --> 15:00.560]  They won't you know, their feelings won't be hurt because you took one of their things the wrong way
[15:00.980 --> 15:02.140]  But I would do that
[15:02.140 --> 15:09.300]  I would if you if your two option choices for the icon were one that was good and one that was bad and you you
[15:09.780 --> 15:14.460]  Insisted on a bad one. I would have written you privately and said, you know made my case for the good one
[15:14.460 --> 15:19.780]  Whereas if you had picked this icon, I would I would have you know, given you my two cents
[15:19.780 --> 15:23.740]  And I think the other one's better and if you disagreed then I would have never said it again
[15:24.260 --> 15:26.640]  Yeah, but I probably wouldn't have brought it up on this show
[15:28.860 --> 15:32.680]  Yeah, I mean like I like ultimately like I'm I'm glad I tried this other icon
[15:33.320 --> 15:38.840]  Because it was pushing that boundary. So you got to keep it up. You can't leave take it off the Twitter account now
[15:38.840 --> 15:41.340]  I know these for a couple of weeks that shows is
[15:41.340 --> 15:43.340]  Green I
[15:43.860 --> 15:48.500]  Mean, I like it on Twitter. It adds a little bit more personality. All right, two more things
[15:48.500 --> 15:51.140]  I want to talk about the one how long it took you to make the app
[15:51.340 --> 15:56.180]  Sounds like it took from your do right up on Marco org. It took about 14 months
[15:56.900 --> 15:59.400]  With maybe a little bit of work that you've done before that
[16:00.020 --> 16:04.740]  Yeah, the audio engine I prototyped earlier than that like about you had a you know spring you said spring
[16:05.300 --> 16:09.620]  2013 and you shipped in the App Store this week in the middle of July 2014
[16:09.620 --> 16:13.420]  Yeah, so yeah about about 14 months. Yeah, so I'll tell you this and I mean this
[16:13.420 --> 16:15.980]  I'm not buttering you up because you're my friend because you're on my show
[16:16.340 --> 16:20.840]  One of the things I really like best about this app is that to me it feels like a 2.0
[16:21.020 --> 16:23.220]  It does not feel like a 1.0 app
[16:24.140 --> 16:29.340]  Thanks. I mean in many ways that's because of the beta because like like what I think what I shipped for beta 1
[16:29.860 --> 16:35.260]  Was like a 1.5. Yeah. Yeah, maybe it was a remarkably productive beta
[16:35.260 --> 16:42.180]  That is true, but even then it was polished afterwards though and to me and maybe again
[16:42.180 --> 16:49.940]  It's vesper-colored eyes where we shipped first after a couple of months without sync and then spent a
[16:50.540 --> 16:52.540]  Well the majority of this year to date
[16:52.700 --> 16:53.980]  overwhelmingly
[16:53.980 --> 17:00.820]  Doing sync and then you know another way to put it is that you know, maybe vesper 1.0
[17:00.820 --> 17:06.460]  It didn't really ship until last month when we shipped the version with sync and we had a version that was usable
[17:06.460 --> 17:09.840]  And I don't regret it. None of us regret it, but it never really
[17:11.020 --> 17:14.960]  It wasn't it clearly wasn't complete without some kind of online sync
[17:14.960 --> 17:18.840]  And I also think it's interesting that it took about the same amount of time
[17:19.840 --> 17:23.940]  you know, it's somewhere a little bit over a year to ship a good app that has an
[17:25.260 --> 17:27.100]  online sync
[17:27.100 --> 17:33.180]  Companion to it. Yeah, and maybe for me maybe maybe that's streaming. Yeah, maybe maybe but I don't know
[17:33.180 --> 17:37.940]  There's a certain you know, cuz you could have shipped a podcast client that didn't have the online component
[17:37.940 --> 17:39.420]  That was more like a lot of other ones
[17:39.420 --> 17:43.780]  You know just to ship it sooner and have it do it and you could have shipped a version
[17:44.060 --> 17:50.740]  That didn't have the custom audio stuff that just helped you manage your podcasts, but didn't have the custom audio stuff first
[17:50.740 --> 17:57.700]  I to me picked you you picked off two or three really difficult things the custom audio
[17:58.260 --> 18:00.900]  Engine and the complete online
[18:01.940 --> 18:03.940]  version
[18:04.620 --> 18:06.620]  That I
[18:06.900 --> 18:11.020]  To me it shows that it feels like it clearly must have taken you over a year
[18:11.020 --> 18:13.020]  Like I don't think you should feel like you were late
[18:13.020 --> 18:18.260]  I know you gave yourself a hard time that back in September. You thought you were six months away from shipping
[18:18.260 --> 18:23.180]  I I thought you were out of your mind when you said that at XOXO. I was like, Jesus Christ
[18:23.180 --> 18:25.180]  He's not gonna ship for two years
[18:25.180 --> 18:27.300]  yeah, and it's you know, I
[18:29.340 --> 18:32.780]  It's it's interesting there's two sides, I mean number one I'm very proud of what I shipped
[18:33.660 --> 18:36.020]  And I'm very happy with how it went number two, though
[18:36.020 --> 18:42.800]  I was shipping this into an extremely mature market and so over the last 24 hours
[18:42.800 --> 18:49.960]  I have heard so many people who are who are very happy with it, but I've also heard so many people who?
[18:50.800 --> 18:55.400]  Who expect a lot more because like if you're it doesn't matter that's a 1.0
[18:55.520 --> 19:00.840]  It matters that I'm shipping a podcast app to the iOS App Store in 2014 and the and the bars raised
[19:00.840 --> 19:05.120]  yeah, that's true and shipping it into a market full of these years old apps and
[19:05.120 --> 19:12.520]  And although actually Castro is only one year old roughly and Castro is one of the most popular apps for iOS
[19:12.520 --> 19:14.280]  Oh, yeah
[19:14.280 --> 19:22.540]  I'll bet it's also even more disproportionately popular with listeners of this show. It's a great app almost certainly. It's a fantastic app. I
[19:23.280 --> 19:30.400]  would I wouldn't be surprised if a majority of people listening to us talk right now are using either overcast or
[19:30.400 --> 19:35.880]  Or Castro probably Castro first because if only because it's older and overcast because
[19:37.000 --> 19:43.380]  Everybody who reads my sites an early adopter. It's very possible. And and you know, and I I like Castro because
[19:44.640 --> 19:48.160]  Castro and I I really don't think are competing for the same people
[19:48.280 --> 19:53.320]  Yeah, I think that's because it's there's there two very different takes on an app
[19:53.320 --> 19:59.280]  It's it's like Twitter epic versus tweet bot, you know, like it's it's these two very different styles different sets of priorities
[19:59.280 --> 20:03.640]  so, you know different features exclusive to one or the other I
[20:04.200 --> 20:08.440]  Don't really see them as like a cutthroat competitor for the same people
[20:08.440 --> 20:13.280]  I see as both doing two very different takes on the same problem that are going to appeal to
[20:14.080 --> 20:16.760]  mostly non overlapping circles of people
[20:17.080 --> 20:21.160]  And the other thing you did that I think is pretty nice and I hope it catches on
[20:21.160 --> 20:26.240]  I've never seen it before though is you've got a section. Is it in the settings or the about screen?
[20:26.240 --> 20:29.520]  So are you settings where you're gonna say?
[20:30.880 --> 20:31.960]  It's so great
[20:31.960 --> 20:36.520]  It's so Marco and whiskey I think whisk has said to me the other day privately because he thinks it's gonna
[20:36.880 --> 20:43.280]  He thinks like by next year. Everybody's gonna have this or at least everybody in our circle. You have a section you're like hey
[20:43.960 --> 20:51.040]  Overcast is not for you. Try these other great apps and you've got a list of five other iOS podcasting apps
[20:51.040 --> 20:54.640]  I think it's five. I think so. Yeah Castro downcast
[20:54.640 --> 21:01.200]  It's the cast pocketcast podcatcher or a pod wrangler, right? And did you randomize the order?
[21:01.320 --> 21:03.960]  Yeah, every time the screen loads it shows it in a random order
[21:04.000 --> 21:11.560]  So there's no alphabetical bias and there's no I've no like friendship bias, right? No friendship bias, but here's five apps
[21:12.640 --> 21:18.920]  That you might want to try if this app is not meeting your needs as a podcast app and it's great
[21:18.920 --> 21:23.080]  And it's it's part of the gene part of the reason I think it's genius is is somewhere out there
[21:23.080 --> 21:29.320]  There's marketing somebody with a real marketing title capital M marketing in their background who's choking right now
[21:29.320 --> 21:34.300]  We're thinking this is insane. That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. You never why would you ever you know?
[21:34.720 --> 21:40.440]  You know you there's no thing on the back of a can of coke that says don't like the taste try a Pepsi and
[21:40.960 --> 21:42.440]  logo
[21:42.440 --> 21:44.360]  and and
[21:44.360 --> 21:49.320]  Instructions for the nearest way to go try one. Here's the quickest way to go try a Pepsi
[21:49.320 --> 21:52.560]  But I think apps are different, right?
[21:52.560 --> 21:56.720]  It's like you're showing it to people who already have the app on their phone, right?
[21:56.720 --> 22:02.720]  You've got them right if you if if the app is for them, you've got them they've they've downloaded the app
[22:02.840 --> 22:06.200]  they've put it on their phone and they're even checking out the settings if
[22:07.240 --> 22:10.160]  You aren't making them happy. Why not?
[22:11.200 --> 22:13.200]  Show them the other apps
[22:13.960 --> 22:15.920]  Yeah that and that was kind of
[22:15.920 --> 22:21.160]  That was kind of the rationale there was like, you know, I'm not gonna pretend like there's no other apps in this category
[22:21.160 --> 22:23.840]  Like that's you know, that that doesn't you know, that's just stupid
[22:23.840 --> 22:26.640]  I'm not gonna I'm not gonna pretend like I'm the first podcast I'm on the App Store and
[22:28.640 --> 22:30.640]  And I think it's a way to
[22:30.880 --> 22:35.900]  To help everyone it helps them potentially bite by getting them sales
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.080]  and it helps me by by
[22:39.080 --> 22:45.520]  Making people respect me and my app even more and and it's like there's no downside to this
[22:46.760 --> 22:48.760]  The fact is if you want to try
[22:49.400 --> 22:52.080]  Every one of these podcast apps you're spending less than 20 bucks
[22:52.600 --> 22:57.640]  you know, like it's we're not talking about major investments huge lock-in like I
[22:58.200 --> 23:03.960]  Know like as we've been talking about like all these different expectations people have a podcast apps and how they want things to behave
[23:04.400 --> 23:08.400]  I know as a user of these things as a listener of podcasts
[23:08.400 --> 23:13.800]  I know that you know that that certain apps will just fit you and certain ones just won't and
[23:14.560 --> 23:16.840]  I don't want someone to be using my app if they hate it
[23:16.840 --> 23:21.720]  you know, like that's like I don't want to like force them to use my app if there's a better one out there and
[23:23.400 --> 23:27.200]  So, you know, hey, I'd rather I'd rather you be happy like I've
[23:28.020 --> 23:31.920]  With instapaper. I talked about a little bit a little bit about this on ITP this week
[23:31.920 --> 23:34.040]  So I won't be too overlapping here, but with instapaper
[23:34.040 --> 23:40.320]  By by the time I sold it I was getting about half of the money from the optional subscription
[23:40.320 --> 23:44.240]  Which was a dollar a month and you got almost nothing for it and I advertise it that way
[23:44.720 --> 23:49.440]  it was it was mostly a way to just like, you know, give me more money if you feel like it that was basically it and
[23:50.160 --> 23:52.840]  to be making almost half your income from that is crazy and
[23:53.760 --> 23:56.520]  I was way more than I ever expected and
[23:57.080 --> 24:01.080]  The reason that worked was because over time I had built up a surplus of goodwill
[24:01.080 --> 24:05.440]  Among my customers by giving them free updates all the time and everything and you know
[24:05.440 --> 24:08.520]  But just by giving them more than giving them more value than what they spent on the app
[24:08.520 --> 24:10.440]  I had built up a surplus of goodwill
[24:10.440 --> 24:15.200]  And so when I put up a thing saying hey, you can give me more money if you want many of them did
[24:16.040 --> 24:20.480]  and so I feel like you know, like like goodwill is something you can
[24:21.800 --> 24:25.000]  Monetize and that's that sounds awful. I know but like it
[24:25.640 --> 24:28.280]  if you put it in better terms like like
[24:28.280 --> 24:35.040]  The it will be returned to you like it comes around and not you know, not completely
[24:35.040 --> 24:36.560]  Not everyone's gonna give you money for nothing
[24:36.560 --> 24:41.040]  but but a decent portion of it more than you probably think will come around and so
[24:42.600 --> 24:46.200]  Being good to people is an important part of a business model
[24:47.080 --> 24:51.960]  It's it's you know, it's in addition to just being a nice cool thing to do. It's also smart
[24:52.680 --> 24:56.640]  it's the only way to approach it with any kind of interest in the long term and
[24:56.640 --> 25:04.160]  And my long term I I have trouble thinking more than five years ahead five years to me seems like a long way off
[25:05.680 --> 25:10.880]  But it's almost certain that I'm still gonna be writing daring fireball and probably still doing this show
[25:13.760 --> 25:21.000]  You know probably still working with Dave and Brent on something some app with Q branch, you know, maybe Vesper will be not done but but
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.040]  You know move aside to the next step or some right like that
[25:27.180 --> 25:34.620]  But the only you know, so many ways of doing business you could you're not they're not thinking that many even five years ahead
[25:34.860 --> 25:40.580]  Right because it's like you're gonna burn through goodwill, right? You can't you can't last long at all while you're burning through goodwill
[25:40.580 --> 25:46.580]  I think in exactly business and it's you know, it's just a short-sighted
[25:46.580 --> 25:53.340]  It's just a short-sighted. Let's just burn through goodwill for 18 months and then see if somebody will buy us because we have a lot of
[25:53.340 --> 25:55.340]  users mentality
[25:55.340 --> 25:56.380]  Here's another question
[25:56.380 --> 26:02.700]  I had sort of related to the last is pricing and I know that you've spent a lot of time thinking about this and
[26:03.820 --> 26:05.820]  You've come up with
[26:06.060 --> 26:11.720]  The app is free. There's only one version of it. It's you just get it you download it for free
[26:11.720 --> 26:16.480]  You can use it. You can use it forever for free
[26:17.000 --> 26:22.320]  Yeah, but you pay there's only one in-app purchase. It's right now. It's $4.99
[26:22.640 --> 26:26.960]  That's it and you buy that and it unlocks a bunch of cool features
[26:28.280 --> 26:31.960]  Yep, that's it. I I thought about so many different models. I
[26:32.680 --> 26:40.000]  at various times in the last like, you know, six months to a year I have I've been mentally committed to a
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  Pay what you want model
[26:42.740 --> 26:48.460]  With multiple buckets that you know, you just pay something anything and if you pay anything at all
[26:48.460 --> 26:51.580]  I give you all the features, but you can pay like three different levels, right?
[26:51.580 --> 26:55.460]  I also thought about the same thing with subscriptions same thing with subscriptions
[26:55.460 --> 27:00.740]  But named pledges because you know using like NPR terminology like public radio terminology because this is about podcast
[27:00.740 --> 27:04.040]  And so you can be a pledging member. Maybe that would make more people do it. Who knows?
[27:05.460 --> 27:07.460]  Also thought about paid up front
[27:07.460 --> 27:13.460]  free with ads free with Squarespace advertising in inside the app all sorts of stuff like that and
[27:14.060 --> 27:16.060]  I I came up with
[27:17.020 --> 27:21.940]  Relatively towards the end of development is when I settled on this. It was a very recent decision
[27:21.940 --> 27:24.560]  I just came up with this because I realized like
[27:24.820 --> 27:30.060]  The more complicated I make it the fewer people are gonna do it and and the more headaches I will have dealing with it
[27:30.260 --> 27:35.220]  Support headaches, you know customer expectations not matching what they're what they're getting stuff like that
[27:35.220 --> 27:37.920]  Just was not it was not gonna be worth complexity
[27:37.920 --> 27:44.340]  And so I went with just okay five bucks in that purchase unlocks limits period a very simple old model
[27:45.540 --> 27:49.420]  relative be able in the iOS world at least but you know a simple model that
[27:50.460 --> 27:52.460]  would give me the most flexibility to
[27:54.160 --> 27:58.220]  To do things in the future like I can I can make a web payment form
[27:58.340 --> 28:02.940]  So that people who can't use in-app purchases for whatever reason can can use the web version and buy it there
[28:02.940 --> 28:05.900]  it's stuff like that and you know, it's easy to support and
[28:06.460 --> 28:11.620]  It's clear to the customers what they're getting and what they're paying for and and when they're gonna be paying and how much gonna be
[28:11.620 --> 28:17.220]  Paying. Yeah, you know any kind of subscription or donation type model it becomes less clear to people
[28:17.220 --> 28:22.220]  Okay, what am I paying for? How much will I be charged? Is this forever or just for a year or what and
[28:23.500 --> 28:29.740]  And you do it without thinking much in summer 2014 and then all of a sudden in summer 2015 when you're charged again
[28:29.740 --> 28:37.180]  Or you're reminded, you know by iOS or however, you know the Magnus like why is this thing that I haven't used this app in?
[28:37.180 --> 28:41.540]  Eleven months. Why is it trying to charge me? Right and then you forget about a developer in demand refund
[28:41.540 --> 28:43.820]  Which they can't give you so yeah, it's it's a mess, right?
[28:44.300 --> 28:45.540]  so
[28:45.540 --> 28:47.540]  This method was just way easier
[28:48.620 --> 28:53.760]  For everybody for me and for the customers and I think that ease will result in better sales
[28:54.340 --> 28:56.660]  There was this heyday. I mean we've talked about it
[28:56.660 --> 29:00.820]  You and I have probably talked about it on this show and other shows, you know
[29:00.820 --> 29:07.480]  We've all talked about everybody who's involved in indie apps in general has talked about it in the post App Store world where yes
[29:07.480 --> 29:12.660]  We've been exposed to a massive market and especially for those of us who were in the Mac before
[29:13.100 --> 29:19.420]  Way bigger than we ever could have imagined before and now it's getting to the point where maybe it's even as big in terms
[29:19.420 --> 29:23.620]  Of people as even Windows was as a market size in terms of people
[29:23.620 --> 29:27.740]  which is amazing and it's a great opportunity and we've
[29:28.220 --> 29:33.820]  Destroyed the one thing that we found before that worked as a way to get people to buy it
[29:33.820 --> 29:36.260]  which was to let you try the app for free and
[29:37.300 --> 29:40.780]  Then pay for it if you want and I feel like you've used
[29:41.460 --> 29:46.980]  This in-app purchase to be to me. It's like I thought about it like you announced, you know, you know
[29:46.980 --> 29:50.600]  here's how I'm going to charge for it and I thought about it and I was like
[29:50.600 --> 29:57.960]  This seems very very obvious. This seems like this is the way to go you get lots of people to try it with no risk and
[29:58.480 --> 30:02.040]  then if they like it, they'll buy it because I thought that the
[30:03.840 --> 30:05.920]  You know, it seemed like a good
[30:06.600 --> 30:11.600]  Line you drew on what you get when you pay for it because you know, it seems like a no-brainer to me. I
[30:12.320 --> 30:17.280]  Know I think it's hard, you know, it's hard for for any app to know where to draw that line, you know
[30:17.280 --> 30:23.240]  And I don't know. I don't know that I've drawn the right line necessarily time will tell people people are nuts about the whole cup of
[30:23.240 --> 30:25.320]  Coffee thing, you know, like oh my god
[30:25.320 --> 30:28.920]  I can't believe you won't do this thing the same thing as a cup of coffee, but there's this weird. I
[30:29.560 --> 30:35.400]  Don't think it's that crazy though. There's a weird psychological thing where you somehow don't even want to pay a dollar
[30:35.400 --> 30:36.760]  I do it
[30:36.760 --> 30:41.740]  I spend the dollar willy-nilly here or there to buy new apps just to see what they look like but I you know
[30:42.040 --> 30:46.720]  I'm an I'm an outlier. I don't look at software the way normal people do
[30:46.720 --> 30:49.080]  I think it's kind of normal that people see
[30:49.720 --> 30:51.720]  99 cents
[30:51.760 --> 30:55.120]  before they even get to see if the app really works on their phone as
[30:55.720 --> 31:01.700]  As a risk and they just don't want to take it and there's a number of factors here that that that you know
[31:01.700 --> 31:03.700]  Make the coffee analogy not work
[31:04.280 --> 31:10.680]  And you know part of it is like people have been burned a lot in the past by bad apps and like they've paid for
[31:10.680 --> 31:16.160]  An app that was not as good as they wanted or didn't do what they thought it would and then they're just out that money
[31:16.160 --> 31:20.440]  I mean you can you can like email Apple and request a refund but most people don't even know that you can do that
[31:20.440 --> 31:23.800]  Let alone how to do that. Yeah, and they would actually go through with it, you know, so
[31:24.320 --> 31:26.320]  So for the most part you're just out of this money
[31:26.320 --> 31:28.040]  And so that's that's no good
[31:28.040 --> 31:32.880]  I'll bet that even even on platforms where refunds are easier and I think Windows Phone is
[31:33.040 --> 31:36.640]  still the easiest Windows Phone makes it really pretty easy to initiate a
[31:37.720 --> 31:41.640]  Refund and it goes through I forget what the time period is
[31:41.640 --> 31:43.640]  I don't know if it's an hour or a day
[31:43.640 --> 31:48.680]  But let's just say it's an hour you download that you pay for an app you download it you load on your phone and you
[31:48.680 --> 31:52.200]  Don't like it. You just go back to the App Store and you say I want a refund and
[31:53.080 --> 31:58.160]  The app is removed from your phone and the developer never gets the money
[31:58.320 --> 32:00.820]  It's almost like it like the transaction doesn't even happen
[32:01.240 --> 32:06.960]  Right and I do think I think it would be great if Apple implemented that but at this point, you know
[32:06.960 --> 32:08.960]  If they haven't already I don't think they ever are
[32:09.360 --> 32:13.080]  But I don't I still don't think that would get people over the hump
[32:13.080 --> 32:14.280]  I don't think it would do much
[32:14.280 --> 32:17.200]  I think it would be can it would be better than not having it at all
[32:17.280 --> 32:23.840]  But I don't think it would get people over that psychological hump of giving over a dollar before they even try the app, right?
[32:23.840 --> 32:27.320]  I mean, I mean I wouldn't do that on the Mac like on the Mac where I you know
[32:27.320 --> 32:30.160]  I've it's a different environment and we've had previous expectations
[32:30.960 --> 32:36.440]  When something is available only in the Mac App Store for a paid price and there's no trial, right?
[32:36.440 --> 32:37.880]  I probably won't buy it
[32:37.880 --> 32:43.200]  Like I expect a trial on the Mac because there have always been trials and a lot of times these apps cost like 30 50
[32:43.200 --> 32:44.520]  75 hundred dollars
[32:44.520 --> 32:51.480]  It's very hard to justify spending 80 bucks on an on a fancy app that you've never tried before that you can't try
[32:52.560 --> 32:58.280]  When refunds are difficult, you know, you know, it's a very hard thing to do paid web apps have never really become a thing
[32:58.720 --> 33:03.440]  For various reasons. Yeah, I mean they have like in like certain verticals, right?
[33:03.440 --> 33:08.200]  But it but not like a mass-market thing, right? And I think that the but
[33:08.960 --> 33:11.320]  What they have done though is that they've still
[33:11.600 --> 33:15.400]  They've reinforced the idea that for something that you see on your computer screen
[33:15.400 --> 33:18.160]  you should be able to just check it out first and
[33:18.760 --> 33:23.120]  Of course for a lot of people it's turned it into everything should just be free period forever
[33:23.960 --> 33:25.320]  and
[33:25.320 --> 33:26.360]  That's a separate argument
[33:26.360 --> 33:32.560]  But I still think that the thing that made indie software development possible on the Mac and and had this
[33:32.560 --> 33:39.820]  Great still great. I think and the reason it's still great on the Mac is that you can still go to developers websites and downloaded
[33:40.400 --> 33:41.600]  demo
[33:41.600 --> 33:44.320]  Exactly, even if you eventually do go to the app store to buy it
[33:44.560 --> 33:49.160]  Well, I don't know if it's different about iOS and another reason why I like the coffee analogy does not work
[33:49.720 --> 33:54.220]  Is yeah, you can say well, you know you you would spend three dollars on coffee without thinking about it
[33:54.760 --> 33:56.760]  that's true, but
[33:56.760 --> 34:02.540]  There aren't people giving away coffee. That's pretty good for free on every single street corner
[34:02.800 --> 34:05.520]  Alright, like imagine Starbucks made every coffee free
[34:05.520 --> 34:05.880]  Yeah
[34:05.880 --> 34:08.000]  If every on every street corner
[34:08.000 --> 34:12.200]  You could walk out of any building anywhere or your house you could and on this corner of the street
[34:12.200 --> 34:15.120]  There were people giving away pretty good coffee for free all the time
[34:15.320 --> 34:19.400]  Like then it would be harder to be a coffee shop that charges for coffee, right?
[34:19.480 --> 34:24.240]  like it it isn't about the amount of money it's about the competition and the alternatives and
[34:24.240 --> 34:29.840]  The fact is there's so many apps. There's so many apps
[34:30.400 --> 34:35.160]  That it doesn't matter that you're charging only a few dollars up front
[34:35.160 --> 34:39.200]  The fact is there's ten free ones right next to you in the App Store and people will just pick those
[34:40.560 --> 34:42.640]  Same thing applies to the web, you know
[34:42.640 --> 34:46.480]  it's the reason why paywalls on the web don't often do very well is
[34:47.040 --> 34:51.360]  Because there's just tons of alternatives that are all free and it's like, okay. Well, I can't read your site fine
[34:51.360 --> 34:52.880]  I was doing you a favor by reading your site
[34:52.880 --> 34:57.320]  I'll go screw read someone else's site, you know, and it's terrible, but that's that's the reality
[34:57.760 --> 34:58.280]  Yeah
[34:58.280 --> 35:03.880]  And you're in that like just give me something to read right now and it's too if you could go read something that you're not
[35:03.880 --> 35:08.480]  as interested in but it's only two clicks away or you can read the thing you're interested in but you've got to take out
[35:08.480 --> 35:12.080]  Your credit card and fill in a form forget it, you know, that's the big problem
[35:12.080 --> 35:15.920]  I have I think paywalls face is that that right now at this moment
[35:16.200 --> 35:20.200]  Even if you've got it in your back your head that maybe a maybe this month
[35:20.200 --> 35:25.320]  I will sign up for the New York Times paywall maybe but in the meantime at any given moment when you're just looking for something
[35:25.320 --> 35:29.160]  To read you're just gonna keep clicking until somebody gives you something that you can actually read
[35:29.920 --> 35:31.920]  It's a little different with apps
[35:31.960 --> 35:35.480]  But anyway, I think that the free app and then pay for it eventually
[35:35.480 --> 35:39.040]  I don't know I pay for it to unlock the rest of the features and I
[35:40.280 --> 35:43.080]  Not that it's a overcast is the first app to do it that way
[35:43.080 --> 35:47.940]  But I think it's played perfectly and I think it's probably gonna be
[35:47.940 --> 35:50.780]  I think we're gonna see a lot more of that
[35:50.780 --> 35:52.060]  I hope so
[35:52.060 --> 35:57.340]  I mean and I wish Apple give us more options in this regard because this model doesn't work for all apps like certain apps
[35:57.420 --> 35:59.900]  It's very hard to know where to draw that line of okay
[35:59.900 --> 36:03.420]  what do you offer for free and what do you charge for because
[36:03.780 --> 36:07.760]  You know certain things like it works well for like games for instance
[36:07.760 --> 36:12.340]  You can like you can give away the first few levels and then have additional levels for purchase or you can you know do things
[36:12.340 --> 36:16.460]  With like oh you can get a power up that you you can only you have to unlock the game to get this power up stuff
[36:16.460 --> 36:22.020]  Like that you can do but think about like a calculator like what do you do charge for like the nine button?
[36:22.340 --> 36:26.020]  Like how do you where do you draw that line and a calculator like how it like true?
[36:26.140 --> 36:28.020]  It's it's a hard thing
[36:28.020 --> 36:34.700]  It's a hard thing to do right and with all credit to James Thompson of pcalc who I think originally made that joke
[36:35.420 --> 36:36.940]  but
[36:36.940 --> 36:41.920]  You know, it doesn't work for so like Apple has it has a rule against time bomb demos
[36:41.920 --> 36:46.960]  Like you can't just say all right you can try everything in the app for a week and then it stops working unless you pay
[36:46.960 --> 36:51.700]  Like you actually can't do that by policy even for a free app, correct? Even for a free app
[36:51.700 --> 36:54.100]  You can I don't think a lot of people know that I think developers know it
[36:54.100 --> 36:58.500]  But I don't think a lot of people know that right and and and I think that rule
[36:59.580 --> 37:02.380]  I'm sure Apple was well intentioned when they made that rule
[37:02.380 --> 37:07.120]  But I think that rule holds back a lot of a lot of like trial where yeah might be their goal
[37:07.120 --> 37:12.340]  but well the effect of it I think it's that hierarchy of Apple's priorities where it's
[37:12.860 --> 37:18.420]  first Apple second their users and third developers in that order and
[37:19.380 --> 37:21.480]  It maybe it's irrelevant to Apple
[37:22.120 --> 37:27.540]  So one is out two. It's better for users if the app doesn't get time bombed
[37:27.540 --> 37:33.980]  So therefore the apps can't be time bombed because users are annoyed when the app that they've been using for the last 30 days suddenly
[37:33.980 --> 37:35.580]  stops working I
[37:35.580 --> 37:37.580]  think that you know and and and
[37:37.980 --> 37:42.020]  Whatever extra money Apple would get from the 30% cut from the extra apps
[37:42.020 --> 37:47.900]  That would be sold if that was allowed because it does work. That's the thing. It's is time bombing, you know
[37:48.420 --> 37:55.540]  Done appropriately is a very effective way for indie developers to get let people try an app and then and then buy it
[37:56.140 --> 37:57.660]  yeah, but it's
[37:57.660 --> 38:00.180]  Yeah, and unfortunately that like for so many, you know
[38:00.180 --> 38:04.860]  like the calculator like there's so many apps where that is the best way to do it because the other problem is if you
[38:04.860 --> 38:07.700]  have something like suppose you have a calculator app and
[38:08.620 --> 38:10.260]  There's some like, you know
[38:10.260 --> 38:15.960]  Certain like special logarithm button that most people don't need and you you want to put that behind the wall
[38:15.960 --> 38:20.260]  So the only people who really need that will pay for it. Well, then most users won't pay for it
[38:20.620 --> 38:24.320]  Yeah, so that then you have a very bad conversion rate of free to paid
[38:25.140 --> 38:29.680]  But if you like you have to be careful what you limit like somebody asked me on Twitter today or an email
[38:29.680 --> 38:31.680]  I forget where it's all it's all a blur
[38:31.680 --> 38:37.240]  at this point somebody asked me they were angry at the limitation I put in place and they said
[38:38.160 --> 38:45.820]  Why don't you offer all features for free and just limit you to only subscribe to like five podcasts?
[38:46.080 --> 38:47.920]  And I thought about that that was one of the options
[38:47.920 --> 38:52.880]  I considered the reason why I didn't do that is because when you set that limit first of all that would complicate things like
[38:52.880 --> 38:59.560]  If you only can listen to five podcasts, what do I do when you import your opml file full of 20 podcasts, right?
[38:59.560 --> 39:02.640]  you know there's there's there's problems with that right up and if and
[39:02.840 --> 39:08.440]  You know right along that line if it's really important to me as a user that you can import my hundred
[39:09.040 --> 39:13.160]  Podcasts opm file. How could I know that that the app is even going to work for me, right?
[39:13.160 --> 39:19.380]  exactly, so so that's problem number one, but then problem number two, you have to be very careful what you do here because
[39:20.280 --> 39:22.280]  Anything you put behind a paywall?
[39:22.800 --> 39:27.340]  Most people will try to find a reason to justify not getting it
[39:27.340 --> 39:33.780]  they will they will try to stay on the free side and try to not need what's on the other side and
[39:34.460 --> 39:36.300]  so if I say
[39:36.300 --> 39:38.300]  limit five podcasts
[39:38.820 --> 39:45.060]  Then I have all these discovery features that try to promote new podcasts and people stay far away from them
[39:45.060 --> 39:47.960]  Because now they're now they have to pay. Yeah now like well
[39:47.960 --> 39:53.940]  No, I don't like then what I'm doing is I am discouraging people from trying out new podcasts
[39:53.940 --> 39:56.420]  That's a terrible thing to do. Why would I want to do that?
[39:56.420 --> 40:01.780]  Like so you have to be very careful what you limit because whatever you limit you're going to then
[40:02.100 --> 40:04.480]  Strongly discourage people from crossing that limit
[40:04.660 --> 40:10.620]  So that's why I've limited things that are basically power user features that don't really have a major
[40:10.940 --> 40:16.540]  Downside that most if you don't get it like I've limited number of playlists
[40:16.540 --> 40:19.060]  You can only have one, you know number of items in a playlist
[40:19.060 --> 40:23.180]  It only displays the top five like these are things like, you know power users will care. Most people won't
[40:23.180 --> 40:27.960]  Playback speeds and the effects and cellular downloads
[40:28.540 --> 40:34.460]  Those are all things that power users would like to do but the app is very functional without them
[40:34.460 --> 40:39.580]  And so like that I feel like those are safer limits to put in place
[40:39.580 --> 40:44.020]  and I mean who knows I could change all these next month if it doesn't work out, but but I feel like that's a
[40:44.700 --> 40:47.100]  Those are like safer lines to draw then
[40:47.500 --> 40:52.580]  I'm going to make you not want to listen to more podcasts in my podcast app because that's terrible
[40:52.580 --> 40:59.960]  All right. Let me take this break take this opportunity to thank our next sponsor our good friends at Harry's
[41:01.500 --> 41:03.260]  Harry's
[41:03.260 --> 41:05.260]  provides high quality
[41:06.260 --> 41:09.760]  men's shaving stuff at a great price
[41:10.860 --> 41:13.260]  Whole point is it's I've told you this before
[41:15.220 --> 41:21.580]  The founders were some of the founders of Warby Parker the eyeglass company same basic idea they looked at the market
[41:21.580 --> 41:27.980]  They said hey everything on the market. Why is this stuff so expensive? Why can't we make good stuff at a way lower price?
[41:28.780 --> 41:30.780]  Same thing with shaving
[41:32.420 --> 41:34.820]  You buy blades from Harry's and
[41:35.900 --> 41:39.140]  They're half the price of the equivalent blades from
[41:39.780 --> 41:42.680]  Like Gillette or what's the other big company?
[41:43.620 --> 41:47.580]  Chick is that chick? Yeah. There you go the ones that I was a Gillette person
[41:47.580 --> 41:50.180]  So that's the one I was familiar with. Yeah. Yeah, I was too. I don't know why
[41:50.180 --> 41:55.380]  And that's what I can compare to is is Gillette and it's same type of quality
[41:55.660 --> 42:01.140]  To me where it just feels like a nice quality blade. Here's how seriously these guys take it. This is what I love
[42:01.140 --> 42:05.980]  I love this story that they bought their own razor blade factory in Germany
[42:07.400 --> 42:11.280]  So that they could control the sharpness and strength of their blades
[42:11.280 --> 42:16.300]  They're not just like white labeling generic razor blades and putting them in a stylish package
[42:16.300 --> 42:20.780]  They have to you know, really really control over the quality
[42:21.820 --> 42:26.220]  And I love the design style of their stuff. I don't think it's just cheaper than Gillette
[42:26.220 --> 42:30.900]  I think it's actually better looking than Gillette to me like the the blade that I got the
[42:32.020 --> 42:34.020]  the razor I got from from
[42:35.060 --> 42:37.060]  Harry's it looks to me
[42:37.060 --> 42:46.340]  like I could be using it in 20 years and it would look just as new and just as stylish whereas Gillette's, you know, like
[42:46.340 --> 42:48.340]  Architecture
[42:48.980 --> 42:56.140]  Industrial design to me it looks so trendy and it's you know, it's like it's like looking at the Transformers movies
[42:56.140 --> 43:00.140]  It looks like you know by next year. It's gonna look like you're using a 2013 razor
[43:01.000 --> 43:03.540]  The price the price difference is truly truly
[43:03.540 --> 43:10.380]  significant, I think it's like two bucks to get a book for each blade with Harry's it's even less if you order in bulk I
[43:10.380 --> 43:14.140]  Think it's like a dollar fifty if you get the big pack. Yeah, so get the bend and Gillette
[43:14.140 --> 43:17.400]  It's you know, it's like even at Amazon. It's like three fifty four dollars a blade
[43:18.220 --> 43:25.020]  And the quality is I'm telling it's there. I I use it you you should switch to using it, right? Yeah
[43:25.020 --> 43:28.660]  Yeah, I've been using it for this. They sent me the simple pack when they when they sponsored my shows
[43:28.660 --> 43:32.560]  I'm almost through it. I think we're more I the handle is is
[43:32.560 --> 43:35.340]  amazing and the blades I would say are
[43:36.300 --> 43:38.300]  Probably I would say on par
[43:38.460 --> 43:42.480]  With Gillette fusion blades, which is my previous favorite and at half the price
[43:42.940 --> 43:47.340]  You can't beat it handle was the word I was looking for when I was trying to choose between
[43:47.440 --> 43:53.720]  You know razor and blade that the you know, the handle the thing you stick into it. I handle your past as a shaving nerd. I
[43:53.720 --> 44:02.260]  I have a brush and everything. Yeah, I used to double the double-edged safety razor and the blades from Israel and everything. Yeah, it's yeah
[44:02.880 --> 44:06.200]  This is good stuff. It is not to tell you something. I don't use it anymore
[44:06.400 --> 44:08.680]  It's not just me telling you to go out there and buy this
[44:09.520 --> 44:14.440]  Cheaper shaving stuff. I'm telling you the quality is there. It's really good. They're very very serious about it
[44:14.440 --> 44:16.200]  I really do. I like it better
[44:16.200 --> 44:19.960]  But just because it to me and it's it I remember you said this on ATP this week
[44:19.960 --> 44:27.200]  There's like a heft to the handle. Yeah, exactly. It's very nicely weighted right in a way that the disposables from Gillette and stuff
[44:27.200 --> 44:30.600]  Well, and even the ones that they don't call disposables. They they pretty much are
[44:31.480 --> 44:37.800]  Hey, like I feel like the Gillette one like it just needs 17 blue LEDs to complete the aesthetic
[44:38.120 --> 44:44.480]  It just it looks like a Transformers movie. Yeah, it's just it's like it's like the very first droid ads
[44:45.080 --> 44:47.320]  Remember they were like like like tacky
[44:47.320 --> 44:53.280]  Masculine robot crazy stuff they did they actually had like they had like laser beams and stuff and weapons
[44:54.640 --> 44:57.440]  You always feel like there's yeah, there's gonna be a laser coming at you
[44:57.440 --> 45:04.480]  I there's a trend and I love it where I've been getting more sponsors like Harry's where they're not
[45:04.840 --> 45:10.320]  Technology at all. This isn't an app. It's it's you know, a real physical product and I
[45:11.000 --> 45:15.840]  Think it's a great market because I feel like my show my website
[45:15.840 --> 45:19.280]  You know and yours Marco's, you know an ATP
[45:19.560 --> 45:27.560]  It's it's not about tech really because there's mass-market tech sites that I think have a wildly different audience
[45:27.560 --> 45:31.240]  I think the audience that I have that you have this audience is
[45:32.440 --> 45:35.320]  More like people who care about nice things
[45:36.040 --> 45:41.000]  Including tech or maybe even especially tech but what they really are interested in is nice things
[45:41.360 --> 45:44.400]  I'd rather have one nice thing than ten mediocre things
[45:44.400 --> 45:47.760]  And Harry's to me fits exactly in that line
[45:47.840 --> 45:52.500]  Well, here's the thing where if you go into a typical drugstore you have zero choices that qualify for that
[45:53.020 --> 45:59.840]  Go online and get it there. Go to here's what you do. Go to Harry's calm. H a r r y s calm
[46:00.320 --> 46:06.120]  Use this promo code talk show they didn't put the done there, but that's not that's not hold it against them
[46:06.120 --> 46:09.000]  Just talk show ta. Ok sh o w
[46:09.840 --> 46:11.400]  and
[46:11.400 --> 46:14.740]  You will get five bucks off your first purchase
[46:15.320 --> 46:18.840]  I don't I can't see why anybody would do this
[46:19.240 --> 46:25.640]  Try it out and then not just sign up and and use this stuff henceforth because it's cheaper and better
[46:26.160 --> 46:27.480]  How do you beat that?
[46:27.480 --> 46:33.720]  Even the box is nice. Yeah, the box is beautiful. It's like all the packaging is really nice Wow
[46:34.720 --> 46:38.420]  Alright, I think that the the when they first sponsored the show
[46:38.420 --> 46:44.080]  They sent me a handle and three blades and I've since reordered, you know out of my own pocket, you know, the the replacement blades
[46:44.840 --> 46:49.600]  I didn't even want to throw the empty box out from the first set of blades because I was so nice
[46:49.600 --> 46:51.880]  But that's just I feel bad throwing away the boxes
[46:51.880 --> 46:56.240]  I mean, it's my but I have to because it's right, but it's I feel bad like they're really nice
[46:56.780 --> 47:01.040]  right because next thing, you know 20 years from now you're you're you know, the crazy person with
[47:01.600 --> 47:03.600]  40 years or 20 years of
[47:03.600 --> 47:10.000]  Shaving cartridge box. I'm just trying to figure out like what what can I put in here? Yeah, like everything that's like small and you know
[47:10.000 --> 47:14.940]  A trapezoid and I go let me I can I can put my screws in here. All right to me
[47:14.940 --> 47:17.320]  That's as good a sign. That's when I knew that it was the real deal
[47:17.320 --> 47:21.140]  I knew as soon as I opened up the box. I was like, oh man, these guys have got it going on
[47:21.960 --> 47:27.120]  The other great thing I just had one other thing and I actually thought about this when you and I was listening to ATP this
[47:27.120 --> 47:29.680]  Week and and you you know, you did your read for Harry's
[47:29.680 --> 47:31.680]  With
[47:32.600 --> 47:37.640]  The cheaper blades to me one of the big differences in my life as I remember when
[47:37.920 --> 47:42.940]  when I was in college and I first even had to start shaving and I didn't have money and I I would use
[47:43.360 --> 47:45.400]  shaving blades forever or too long
[47:46.760 --> 47:51.420]  What a difference it made when I started I woke up and it's like, you know what you don't use them that long
[47:51.420 --> 47:58.080]  Go if you pay less for them, you'll you'll use them less and use a fresher one more often
[47:58.080 --> 48:02.840]  You don't have to sweat. That's that's actually a nice trick. Like I read back when I was a shaving nerd
[48:02.840 --> 48:06.400]  I there was like this one post that kind of stuck with me from a guy who was like
[48:06.660 --> 48:10.220]  you can basically shave however you want with whatever blade you can find as
[48:11.040 --> 48:15.880]  Long as you use a new blade every single time and if you use a new blade every single time
[48:16.160 --> 48:21.080]  you're you will like if you had sensitive skin, which I do like all those problems will go away and
[48:21.800 --> 48:27.280]  I've never been that extreme because blades are expensive usually, you know, especially in my years as a Gillette owner
[48:27.280 --> 48:32.840]  You know, I'm paying, you know 375 a blade. Usually it's it's expensive. It seems wasteful to throw those away every time
[48:34.400 --> 48:37.840]  But when when the cost goes so dramatically down like it does with Harry's
[48:38.520 --> 48:44.640]  It becomes more plausible and more practical to only only keep a blade for like three or four shaves
[48:44.760 --> 48:48.080]  Yeah, and it's I'm telling you it makes it makes a nice difference with every blade
[48:48.080 --> 48:53.680]  I've tried you know to not try to extract a month worth of use out of a blade
[48:53.680 --> 48:59.200]  And if they're cheaper, you can do that. Yeah, I actually shave more often now because I have Harry's
[49:00.080 --> 49:04.540]  That's a I can say that I'm not even just say that the sponsor read is over
[49:04.540 --> 49:10.080]  I'm just saying that that's actually the truth and they even their cream like I I've tried a lot of shaving cream because again
[49:10.080 --> 49:12.080]  I've been this shaving nerd
[49:12.520 --> 49:19.560]  And and the one I found was the best for me was the pro Rosso green variant. I
[49:19.560 --> 49:26.640]  Was and I've tried many others trendy ones like the Taylor of Old Bond Street and like all the fancy boutique ones. I
[49:27.240 --> 49:30.120]  Would say the Harry's cream for me was number two
[49:30.680 --> 49:36.120]  and really I've tried a lot and it didn't quite top per Rosso for me, but it was really close and
[49:36.920 --> 49:43.600]  That's saying a lot. It's nice and simple gets the job done. Nothing fancy. Yeah, it's not made. It doesn't look like a blue laser
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.440]  Yeah, exactly. It looks very tasteful and modern
[49:46.440 --> 49:51.440]  Yeah, looks like what shaving cream is supposed to and the funny thing is to since I've since I visited their site recently
[49:52.120 --> 49:56.580]  now I'm seeing their ads and all the Google Adsense boxes all over the internet as I browse and
[49:56.800 --> 49:59.060]  Their ads are so much more tasteful looking
[50:00.000 --> 50:04.640]  Because they're you know, it's the graphical banner version because Google, you know that whole thing when Google said oh, we're not gonna do banners
[50:04.640 --> 50:07.060]  You know, originally they had of course that's out the window now
[50:07.680 --> 50:09.880]  and so now I'm seeing nice like
[50:10.560 --> 50:13.240]  Trendy beautifully designed Harry's ads all the way
[50:13.240 --> 50:14.960]  It's
[50:14.960 --> 50:19.680]  They aren't they're nice ads. So there you go. You'll improve your ad viewing experience as well by checking out
[50:20.360 --> 50:22.360]  Harry's side benefits, you know
[50:22.440 --> 50:26.880]  But anyway, great product glad to have them on board and and you're nuts if you don't try them
[50:27.720 --> 50:32.440]  I'm not doing you any favors trying to keep this show short. Well, that's good because I feel terrible
[50:32.440 --> 50:33.560]  I feel like I've taken up
[50:33.560 --> 50:38.000]  I mean, you're a very busy man with a brand new app and I've taken up eight hours of your of your
[50:38.000 --> 50:42.640]  Thursday night. Well, I believe man rather be doing this than answering. What is now?
[50:44.680 --> 50:47.840]  1139 emails, I believe that's about 45 more than we started
[50:48.200 --> 50:54.680]  We could measure the length of the episode and how many emails have come in to the overcast support mailbox
[50:54.680 --> 50:57.160]  Yeah, and it's it's just about midnight Eastern time
[50:57.160 --> 51:03.420]  I like I mean obviously these people aren't all in u.s. Eastern time, but like just let me get this array of emails
[51:03.420 --> 51:10.580]  Now do you still use you just use email for support it's just it because it's just you and why not right I
[51:10.920 --> 51:16.260]  Have in like with instapaper. I hired somebody to help me with support, you know, just did that
[51:16.260 --> 51:19.420]  Did you still use email or did you switch to some sort of?
[51:20.380 --> 51:23.660]  You know like online system for a while
[51:24.580 --> 51:30.460]  I would just I just gave him an email address and gave him hosting and it just went to his inbox because it was just
[51:30.460 --> 51:34.940]  One guy and so that was you know, that was fine. And then after a while he said hey, you know
[51:34.940 --> 51:39.660]  I'd like to try someone some of these tools that are out recently, you know, see if they're easier. Okay, sure. So
[51:40.540 --> 51:44.940]  He tried zendesk. I think was the one we ended up going with. He tried a couple of them. I
[51:45.860 --> 51:49.020]  have I've used a few of these tools before and
[51:49.900 --> 51:53.080]  I hate all of them like everyone I've ever tried. I've hated
[51:53.960 --> 51:59.540]  What's the one from the other guy who co-founded Stack Overflow Joel? Yeah fog bugs fog bugs
[51:59.540 --> 52:05.940]  Yeah, and I use that actually that was what tumblr used for a long time and I I hated it in different ways at least
[52:07.420 --> 52:10.580]  What's nice about that one is that it's free if you have a small team, which is really nice
[52:10.580 --> 52:13.380]  At least it was six years ago. I think it's still it probably is
[52:15.580 --> 52:20.200]  All of these products try to do too much in in different ways
[52:20.900 --> 52:26.800]  There there are very few that are focused only on just answer support emails and tweets like that. Yeah, that's all I really need
[52:26.800 --> 52:31.320]  Even if you leave out the tweets, even if someone else doesn't even if you could do email like that's that'd be great
[52:31.800 --> 52:38.080]  The problem is it's very hard for any of those things to actually be better than email. You know it email is is a
[52:38.440 --> 52:41.940]  Very old mature and very versatile tool
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.920]  You can do a lot with with just email and you know
[52:44.920 --> 52:47.480]  A lot of things like all the like I still email things to myself
[52:47.800 --> 52:53.940]  From my phone because it's easier than X Y or Z or it works better or it's more more robust or I can do
[52:54.200 --> 52:56.200]  This extra thing if I need to with it
[52:56.200 --> 52:57.800]  so
[52:57.800 --> 53:00.360]  Email for all of its problems of which there are many
[53:01.120 --> 53:07.360]  for all of its problems it is a really good generalist and so I
[53:08.560 --> 53:11.240]  So anyway, so for now, I'm just using email I
[53:11.760 --> 53:16.560]  In the future and I'm using text text expander to help a lot with some of the snippets like some of the common stuff
[53:16.560 --> 53:18.680]  Saying this is a known bug. Thank you, you know stuff like that
[53:19.400 --> 53:23.640]  Or like my email signature, you know, it's it helps to have all that stuff be
[53:23.640 --> 53:25.560]  be
[53:25.560 --> 53:27.560]  helpful it helpfully automated but
[53:28.240 --> 53:34.780]  I've never I've never found one of these tools that if you're just one person obviously email has problems when you try to scale to
[53:34.780 --> 53:36.960]  Multiple people trying to address the same support inbox
[53:38.000 --> 53:41.060]  Then then it then I I definitely suggest using something else
[53:41.480 --> 53:45.920]  It also is kind of inconvenient if you hear from the same people a lot
[53:46.360 --> 53:49.040]  Because like the fancy systems, they'll be able to like bring up
[53:49.040 --> 53:55.600]  Oh this person emailed you before and they'll show their previous emails along with their like a sort of CRM type thing. Yeah
[53:55.600 --> 53:59.440]  Yeah, so, you know if you have certain certain needs then you need something else
[54:00.280 --> 54:02.280]  but for just one person
[54:02.780 --> 54:06.440]  Answering their own support inbound requests for an app that you know
[54:06.440 --> 54:11.520]  Like I'm probably not like once this all settles down I would I would estimate I'll probably get
[54:11.520 --> 54:18.220]  It fewer than 20 emails a day for it. Hopefully much fewer than 20, but I'd love to be under 10
[54:18.800 --> 54:20.760]  I
[54:20.760 --> 54:23.960]  That's obviously a total blind guess out of my ass
[54:23.960 --> 54:28.160]  I have no idea but I assume that's gonna be the level I'm talking about and
[54:28.880 --> 54:33.760]  So for that it's like is the complexity of another system really worth it because these systems they all have you know
[54:33.760 --> 54:39.840]  They have these web interfaces that are slow and and clunky and I don't know. I I'm a big fan of native apps
[54:39.840 --> 54:42.760]  I like I like a lot about native apps
[54:42.760 --> 54:47.480]  And so like just being able to just do this all my email client, which I'm already very fast at using
[54:47.480 --> 54:54.040]  I just use mail app, you know, it's not not anything fancy. I've been using mail app for years. I know it extremely well
[54:54.040 --> 54:56.300]  I'm very fast with it and it works everywhere
[54:56.300 --> 55:01.480]  I don't have to like get us a different app for each device because I already have mail on all my devices and
[55:01.800 --> 55:06.040]  So it's like it's it's just it's just easier in so many ways
[55:06.040 --> 55:12.320]  If you're just one person answering one inbox for it when I was at bare-bones and this is you know
[55:13.360 --> 55:18.220]  12 13 years ago, you know early the early 2000 2000 to 2001 2002
[55:19.280 --> 55:24.560]  And a lot of my job was you know help pitching in on the the support queue
[55:24.560 --> 55:28.160]  We did it all at the time. We did it all by IMAP even though it was multiple
[55:28.160 --> 55:29.440]  Yeah shared IMAP folder
[55:29.440 --> 55:35.200]  But it worked for a few reasons which was a the only people who had access to it were all trusted
[55:35.200 --> 55:42.160]  There wasn't anybody who who was you know, doing support email who wasn't like a truly trusted employee
[55:43.200 --> 55:45.120]  and
[55:45.120 --> 55:51.240]  B it was it's really simple system where nobody you didn't answer anything from the inbox everybody
[55:51.240 --> 55:54.400]  we just made top-level folders for each of us, you know, like
[55:55.000 --> 55:59.880]  You know, John rich and you know, whoever else was doing stuff Patrick
[55:59.880 --> 56:05.120]  And you would you know, if you were gonna you know, I'm gonna do support for the next hour
[56:05.240 --> 56:11.080]  You would just dig in go through the inbox and drag any messages that you were gonna take to your inbox
[56:11.640 --> 56:15.960]  And you know your it wasn't even an inbox but your box. Yeah, you're gonna answer them from there
[56:15.960 --> 56:17.960]  So your folder should almost always be empty
[56:18.880 --> 56:22.320]  Except for maybe like one or two flagged things that you were, you know
[56:22.320 --> 56:26.120]  Hey, I need to I gotta go I gotta go talk to rich about this and get in it
[56:26.120 --> 56:29.340]  You know, I can't answer that. I'll write them back now and say hey
[56:29.340 --> 56:31.820]  I'll get back to you later, but I actually don't know the answer to that
[56:31.960 --> 56:35.240]  You know, I'll keep it but did you know by the end of the day?
[56:35.240 --> 56:41.680]  Your yours should be empty and then and then nobody would be double answering the same email from the inbox or something like that
[56:42.080 --> 56:46.520]  Yeah, and and that kind of system you're like, you know it when you're in a when you're in an environment where like, you know
[56:46.520 --> 56:51.440]  Everyone's trusted and everyone's like, you know able to do they're able to treat it properly
[56:52.360 --> 56:58.280]  Then it was super simple and then everyone can use their own app and there's no like weird additional
[56:58.280 --> 57:02.360]  you know third-party thing to integrate and pay for and support and
[57:02.640 --> 57:06.480]  move with and then migrate off of when they go out of business and it's just it's
[57:07.280 --> 57:13.720]  Yeah, I mean email I get it for all of its problems. It's really good at a lot of things and and more importantly
[57:13.840 --> 57:16.080]  It's good enough at a lot of things
[57:16.080 --> 57:20.440]  Yeah, and I also like that you kind of know what the customer is gonna see from you
[57:20.440 --> 57:24.000]  I mean, you don't know exactly how they have their font set up in their mail client or whatever
[57:24.000 --> 57:27.480]  But if you just write them an email, you know, it's gonna look like, you know all their other email
[57:27.480 --> 57:34.640]  It's not gonna be some weird, you know, HTML formatted thing and it's not gonna have a whole bunch of
[57:36.240 --> 57:38.240]  Auto generated
[57:38.880 --> 57:45.040]  Administrative stuff, you know that to reply to this message. Please include this text in the subject line
[57:45.040 --> 57:51.340]  Yeah, yeah all that crap and you know, make sure you write your entire reply above this line
[57:52.000 --> 57:57.420]  You know, it's like customer hostile experiences. Yeah that you're you know, they're writing to you
[57:57.420 --> 58:01.600]  they're your customer and you're giving them all these rules to follow about not changing the subject and
[58:02.200 --> 58:07.480]  You know, make sure it makes for God's sake make sure everything you write is above this line and stuff like that
[58:08.560 --> 58:11.980]  You know, it's just an email just text. Here you go. Here's your answer. I
[58:14.400 --> 58:16.400]  Guess we should cover the news
[58:16.960 --> 58:21.080]  Why don't I do my last sponsor? Why don't I talk about our last? Yeah, they're good friends at
[58:21.920 --> 58:23.520]  hover
[58:23.520 --> 58:29.560]  You guys know hover. I use hover. They are the domain registrar. That does not suck
[58:30.600 --> 58:32.600]  Quite possibly the only one
[58:32.880 --> 58:35.600]  It's the best way to buy and manage domain names
[58:35.640 --> 58:37.320]  So when you have a great idea
[58:37.320 --> 58:39.440]  You want to get a domain name for it?
[58:39.440 --> 58:44.800]  Guess what really really hard because it's hard to find a good domain name because so many of them are taken
[58:45.200 --> 58:49.600]  hover has some great tools for helping you find domain name that's
[58:49.600 --> 58:53.440]  available and that's gonna work with the name that you have in mind whether it's
[58:53.720 --> 59:00.280]  Trying other top-level domains or whether it's combining other things before the top-level domain to get something that you like
[59:01.720 --> 59:04.520]  They're gonna give you exactly what you need to get the job done
[59:05.320 --> 59:07.520]  And you can trust them one thing
[59:07.520 --> 59:14.040]  I've got to tell you domain name registrars are so scammy in general that I have never trusted before I started using hover
[59:14.040 --> 59:15.480]  I never trusted
[59:15.480 --> 59:22.560]  using their tool to see if a name is available because I always suspected that half of them would just if I say hey is
[59:22.600 --> 59:23.880]  You know
[59:23.880 --> 59:25.800]  you know is
[59:25.800 --> 59:32.200]  You know Marco's new car.com available that they're gonna register it and then hold it hostage to me because they was available
[59:32.200 --> 59:37.440]  But they know I want it. So they took it. Yeah, it's it's unfortunately it's a business that's full of
[59:38.400 --> 59:42.960]  Opportunities for sleaziness. I don't know if any domain registrar has ever done something that scammy
[59:42.960 --> 59:48.880]  But it the fact that it occurred to me it, you know with hover. I'm telling you you can trust these guys
[59:48.880 --> 59:53.800]  They've been in business forever. I mean, I think like all the way back to the 90s
[59:54.320 --> 59:59.080]  Great reputation just search the web for what people who use hover say about them
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:05.320]  great tools great service customer service including
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:10.520]  What they call the what they call it the white glove service
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:14.320]  The valley transfer valley transfers, right?
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:20.800]  This is what you do you sign up from become their customer and you have a domain name probably at a shitty registrar
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:25.080]  Really, you know, let's I'm not gonna name names, but you know who it probably is
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:33.760]  It's really hard to tricky to transfer domains, especially because most of us aren't DNS experts
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:38.400]  we can't really remember the exact step-by-step thing of what you do and
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:42.880]  DNS is the thing that you can screw up you can screw it up
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.680]  And it's a pain in the ass to fix it. Once you've screwed it up
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:53.580]  Use hovers Valley transfer service and they'll walk you through the steps. They'll help you transfer
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:55.580]  they'll even transfer it for you and
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:59.720]  you move it from your crappy registrar to hover and
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:06.100]  That's free. They just take care of that process for you just by you paying to become their customer
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:10.560]  It's just included in the price of being a hover customer great support
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:15.200]  They have other things they have volume discounts. That's a new thing that they're offering
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:20.760]  They give you a discount on domain renewals starting at just ten domains
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:26.280]  So if you've got you're like me and you know, like an idiot every time you have a good idea for a domain
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:31.760]  Even though you've only started like one website that you've stuck with in your life and you just keep registering them
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:37.400]  But god forbid you let anybody else take over them. They'll help you out with this
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:42.840]  Discount on renewals if you've got ten or more. So what do you do to check them out?

[01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:34.600]  Dot company I would go as far as to say don't set up for almost any of the new tlds
[01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:41.160]  They weren't great for all the old ones. Well, I don't know dot ninja might be cool if you're using it ironically
[01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:47.420]  They should is there a dot parking lot. They should have a dot parking lot for fans of ATP

[01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:11.940]  And they'll know you came from here from my show where where we talk about IBM every week, of course. I
[01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:16.340]  Love that like obviously that code is not used by anybody else
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:23.140]  Like that's how a relevant IBM is to the consumer web these days is like that they can just throw that out there
[01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:25.140]  No one's gonna use that code. I
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:27.820]  wonder I
[01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:33.340]  Think that's part of what had me so head-scratching about the whole IBM Apple news this week
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:37.300]  Which I guess is really the only news. I don't know. Is there anything else you want to talk about but not really
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:42.960]  Is why why is this why is it even Apple?
[01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:49.140]  Presenting this is such a big deal right because Apple put out a big press release and they made Tim Cook
[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:53.040]  Available for a bunch of interviews, you know
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:58.500]  which to me is the bigger sign that Apple thinks it's a big deal if Tim Cook is gonna spend the day talking to
[01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:05.660]  CNBC and the Wall Street Journal and a bunch of other things a day of Tim Cook's time means it's important and
[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:07.660]  I that's you know
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:12.260]  My thought and this is just one of those things where it's like it didn't instantly make any sense
[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:15.940]  Not that didn't make sense, but it didn't make sense to me why it was a big deal. I
[01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:18.740]  think I mean
[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:22.260]  I don't know anything about the world of enterprise computing and
[01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:25.660]  Thank God for that because the little bits of it that I've touched here and there I've hated
[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:33.260]  I'm very badly suited to it. If that like I'm not saying it sucks. I'm saying it sucks for me
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:35.260]  Oh
[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:38.060]  Let's be honest it probably does suck. But anyway, I
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:42.260]  Think there's there's probably a lot of value in
[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:48.580]  Apple making a big deal out of this in all the ways that consumers will never hear about or care about
[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:56.380]  But that businesses will because the whole point of this is to try to try to push the iPhone and iOS platform more
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:58.940]  Into business and make it make it
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:04.020]  It kind of fight fight the notion that that has plagued it for a while
[01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:10.040]  Which is this is like only for consumers or it's it's inferior for business purposes to things like blackberry
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:18.340]  You know, they they're trying to fight that that perception and and that perception has been declining for a while as iOS devices
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:19.740]  have been pushed into business anyway
[01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:22.100]  just because people wanted them so badly and they they kind of
[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:27.100]  were forced to adopt them and then iOS got better with with some of its enterprise stuff, but
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:34.780]  Ultimately, that perception is still there among a lot of like IT managers that oh the iOS Apple stuff is not is not for business
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:38.620]  You know, it's not it's not ready for the enterprise or what, you know, whatever crap if they spew out
[01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:42.100]  I I think that's true. I've said this before I've it's like a
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:47.540]  Recurring thing I come back to every couple months because something else will pop up right it occurs to me
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:51.540]  But it's the human beings are psychologically
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:54.060]  Set up to make first impressions
[01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:59.540]  Impressions difficult to break, you know, and it's a cliche to say first impressions
[01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:04.580]  You know are super important and they're you know, like when you have a job interview you should do, you know
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:08.260]  get all stressed out and do all these things right and dress exactly right and
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:12.340]  Answer all the questions right and have a good handshake and all these things but you know what?
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:16.060]  It's one of those cliches that's kind of true and I'm not saying it's fair or it's right
[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:23.820]  But it matters and so people's and it matters not just for your impressions of people but your impressions of everything and
[01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:30.740]  If your first impression of Apple is that they're not for business and it was reinforced for a while
[01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:33.260]  it doesn't matter if it was it's
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:39.500]  Set back in 1996 when it was almost literally a completely different Apple
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:42.660]  It still stands for some people today
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:47.780]  You know definitely and and a lot of those people are IT managers at big companies
[01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:51.660]  Yeah, and that I think so true. I think so. I think that's exactly true
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:54.020]  Yeah, and that's why I'm saying like, you know
[01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:58.100]  Tim Cook going around doing all these like BS interviews with business people about business things
[01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:03.860]  I think it's all about attacking that it's all about like getting out there and you know a press release
[01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:07.580]  Well, what consumers gonna give a crap about a press release? No, no one's ever gonna hear about it
[01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:10.300]  You know, like my pizza guy who asked me about Apple rumors every time I got a pizza
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:14.020]  Because he reads all like he reads like all the worst Apple rumor sites
[01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:19.140]  So he always asked me about all the ridiculous like the most ridiculous rumors possible things that are so ridiculous
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:21.140]  You won't even comment on them. I
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:25.340]  Get every time I get pizza, which is pretty often. I I get asked about those things and
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:29.380]  And you know, he's never gonna hear about this ever
[01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:35.660]  Because it is so unimportant to even consumers who are interested in Apple never gonna cross his radar
[01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:39.100]  but the business community this will be like
[01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:46.100]  There's gonna be a white paper somewhere. There's gonna be like things the business community needs like sources, you know references
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:48.020]  Oh, well, this is apparently getting into business
[01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:53.500]  This is this is something that that IT managers can show each other and the CF and the CTO
[01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:59.180]  And the CEO above them like they can show each other and everyone here. We should maybe consider this
[01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:01.900]  Here's some supporting documents to support this, you know
[01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:08.140]  it's all about placating the needs of the business world in using their language and and their
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:10.060]  methods of
[01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:14.700]  Communicating. Yeah tech even even at the enterprise level it moves fast
[01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:20.540]  But it it tech moving fast at the enterprise level is a hell of a lot slower
[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:25.940]  Than it moves at the consumer level. Yeah. I'm pretty sure my bank still uses Windows 2000
[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:33.740]  Well, right exacts a perfect example like God and how many ATMs are out there that are still running crazy old Windows systems and stuff
[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:41.660]  like that, I just saw a thing about ATMs like when Windows 98 based
[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:46.220]  No, maybe they maybe it was a POS system. I don't know and it's you know, that's yeah
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:50.860]  And I know that the target the target hack was based on a crazy old
[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:56.660]  Ancient version of Windows that they'd still been rolling out in brand new target stores, you know decades later
[01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:00.920]  But it does, you know it compared to the world at large. It still moves fast
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:06.880]  But it's it's easy to miss because it's so much slower than the daily
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:14.720]  Barrage of tech news that it's easy to miss the trends until they're already in the rearview mirror
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:20.000]  And I kind of feel like what what Apple this Apple IBM deal is showing is it sort of?
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:23.720]  stage two the beginning of stage two of Apple's
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:30.080]  Renaissance in the business market stage one was just getting iPhones and iPads in at all
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:36.040]  And it's literally what they've bragged about for the last few years is the percentage of fortune 500 companies
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:41.680]  Where iOS devices are used and it's you know, it's now it's up to like a ridiculous number
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:46.560]  It's like 98 percent, but it's always been a little conspicuous that they don't say how many are being used in each one
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:50.880]  It's right. It's a lot of times like they aren't officially supported like a lot of times
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.340]  You know the the devices have gotten into these companies
[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:59.500]  Reluctantly because somebody in a position of power got an iPhone or iPad and wanted to use it at work
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:03.180]  And so then the IT department which didn't really want to support it. It's like alright fine
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:06.300]  You know the CEO got an iPhone who wants to use it. We have to do this
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:10.940]  So yeah, we'll support it in a half-assed minimal way, but we're not going to let everyone do this
[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.940]  I don't think that's what Apple's counting though
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:17.980]  I think when Apple says 98% of the fortune 500 is using an iPhone is using the iPhone
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:24.820]  I think that they they're there. I think Apple's honest enough that that means that they honest they have some kind of corporate relationship
[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:28.500]  Through the an Apple's enterprise, you know salespeople
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:34.540]  That that they can legitimately say that yeah, I mean a company is that big yeah, but I don't think it necessarily
[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:38.620]  Translates to a high unit count or head count, right?
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:43.780]  I mean just to pick one example of a company who I know is must be in a fortune 500 because they're the second
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:45.820]  biggest company in the world axon
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:49.100]  You know, so let's say assuming axon is part of that 98%
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:55.380]  doesn't mean there's a thousand people with iPhones and axon because that's not that big a deal because axon probably has you know,
[01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:58.060]  tens and tens of thousands of employees
[01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:00.060]  I
[01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:03.900]  Think that that's stage one though. It's just getting any relationship at all
[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:09.020]  Maybe it's you know, I use it. Maybe it's just the c-level people. Maybe it's just like hey the CEO wanted an iPhone
[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:15.020]  So officially, you know anybody who works in the CEO's office can use an iPhone but like the rank-and-file
[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:22.900]  Of tens of thousands of people, you know still you're using whatever, you know, I don't know blackberries or something like that, right?
[01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:24.780]  I
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.460]  think stage two is
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:32.620]  about getting that number bigger and Tim Cook kind of alluded to that in one of his interviews that that there's a
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:37.420]  Huge that yes, we've got this huge number of fortune 500 companies doing it
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:41.500]  But that there's tons of devices and you know of various, you know
[01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:44.900]  Whether the phones or PCs or whatever that could be replaced
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:47.700]  with iOS devices
[01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:54.740]  And that there's a huge upside there in terms of just sheer numbers and I think that's what this is about
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:57.900]  Yeah, maybe I mean to some degree
[01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:02.420]  Having like using iOS devices as
[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:06.100]  Like custom work terminals or like, you know
[01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:12.580]  Like my UPS guy hands me some kind of crazy-ass thing to sign digitally when I when I get a package delivered
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:17.260]  yeah, and you know the idea of that someday being an iPhone or an iPad I
[01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:20.100]  actually have a hard time buying that because
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:25.220]  The characteristics that that businesses expect if they're gonna do something like that
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:28.780]  like they're gonna expect a platform that is highly customizable to exactly their needs and
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:32.540]  Stable and will basically bend over backwards to support them indefinitely
[01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:40.500]  None of those things are Apple strong points or even Apple wanting to do those things like like Apple is perfectly
[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:46.020]  Happy to like drop support for old things lock down control all sorts of all sorts of
[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:49.700]  Characteristics that that let them produce good devices
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:56.820]  As long as you fit within their needs, but also tend to shut out corporate needs like that
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:13:01.100]  Yeah, well, I think that's though it potentially plays to Apple's traditional strengths though
[01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:04.340]  Where Apple is never been about selling all of anything?
[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.500]  You know that they don't need
[01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:09.500]  You know
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:16.360]  That's what Microsoft was always about Microsoft wanted every single computing device in the entire building to be running some version of Windows
[01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:18.900]  Whereas Apple I don't think is going to shoot for that
[01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:22.980]  I don't mean oh if Apple would say to UPS you still want to have all I mean
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:26.220]  I wonder how many you P how many UPS guys didn't are like the delivery guys?
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:31.620]  Oh, I don't know probably I don't know 30 40 thousand. I'm no idea though. I don't know. Yeah
[01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:36.020]  It's one of those terrible like job interview questions. I was gonna guess 25,000
[01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:39.820]  So, I don't know that that's just a guess but you know, let's say 25,000
[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:47.660]  So let's say they have I don't know 30,000 of those signer things because they want to have more of them than they have people
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:53.880]  And they say you know what? We don't really want to use iOS devices for this for X Y & Z reasons
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:58.900]  I think Apple would say okay, that sounds good, you know, but if you know, what about if every every manager at?
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:07.580]  The depot centers where their dispatch was using an iPhone and using an iPhone app a custom iPhone app to manage whatever he did
[01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:09.580]  He does all day. I
[01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:16.060]  Think you know if that's all they got that would be great because it's all upside for them because they never sold anything to those
[01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:18.060]  Companies that's a good point
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:24.660]  You know that the only the places where you could see the need for a $500 iPad, you know
[01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:28.740]  But if it's possible that a $500 iPad would make sense for you and it totally makes sense
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:31.040]  It may be for a UPS delivery guy
[01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:34.420]  Who's got a really physical job that a?
[01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:37.100]  $500 device with a glass screen
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:41.860]  Or even you know a sapphire screen. It doesn't make any sense
[01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:45.900]  You know, it's not durable enough and it's too expensive when it's to replace when it's broken
[01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:52.660]  But there's still all sorts of opportunities where an iOS device might make sense and never you know
[01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:57.120]  It's all upside for Apple because they never had anything no foothold in that market
[01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:03.540]  Yeah, that's fine. I asked today. I don't know if you saw you were real busy today, but I asked today
[01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:06.460]  Yeah, I think
[01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:08.780]  Well my clears my question is
[01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:15.280]  Yeah, we're Tim Cook City uses an iPad for 80% of his work and then I which I think is you know
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.180]  I think it's interesting and I kind of believe him
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:17.860]  I like I said
[01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:19.580]  I don't know that I'm sure he didn't
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:26.220]  scientifically measure have somebody follow him around with a stopwatch and measure how much time spent on the biggest red flag that that sounds
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:32.300]  Suspicious to me is text input. Like does he use a keyboard? I doubt it. I mean that wouldn't look very good
[01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:38.180]  You know, how does he manage text input does he just send a lot of very short email responses?
[01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:42.860]  So I would imagine the CEO I would imagine a big part of his job is responding to email
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:49.700]  It's a good question, I would think so too, but maybe he'd you know send short email Steve Jobs sent short emails, you know, I
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:56.460]  Think Steve Jobs his latter his latter year is an awful lot of the member when those email those those Mac rumors things
[01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:57.020]  Oh, yeah
[01:15:57.020 --> 01:16:02.620]  some some random guy on the internet got an answer from Steve Jobs an awful lot of those in the last few years were
[01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:07.260]  Had sent sent from my iPhone. Yeah, I'd say most of them actually did yeah
[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:11.660]  So Steve Jobs was sending a lot of email from his iPhone. I don't know that it's
[01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:16.220]  It's ridiculous that Tim Cook is too. It's fair. I always thought as an aside
[01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:20.540]  I always thought it was very noble that Steve Jobs kept that default
[01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:25.540]  Sig on his email, which is terrible, I think yeah
[01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:29.980]  Yeah, but it kind of makes sense that it would it would be Steve Jobs the signature, you know like that
[01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:33.980]  I could see that like that. It's a very fair. That's honestly very fair
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:37.580]  like like like when you buy a new Samsung Galaxy S and
[01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:42.540]  The default sig is sent from my Samsung trademark Galaxy trademark
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:45.420]  six trademark
[01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:49.260]  on AT&T LTE 4G internet
[01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:57.900]  From the now trademark network trademark on AT&T trademark. Do you really think that AT&T's CEO is is using that?
[01:16:58.460 --> 01:17:03.260]  Signature on his phone. I hope so, but I doubt it. Yeah, I really doubt
[01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:07.740]  I think it should be a rule that if if you if you are the kind of if you're at the kind of position where you can
[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:12.300]  Dictate a default email signature that will be used by thousands of people. Yeah, you should have to use it yourself
[01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:15.980]  I absolutely believe whatever the default is that you said you should have to use it
[01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:22.060]  Right. I've I've you know, I believe in personal freedom and liberty, but I would support making that a law
[01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:28.860]  And you know what? There's an easy way that you can you can set your email signature to whatever you want by just shipping a default
[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:35.260]  Email signature, that's a blank exactly and ask them, you know, what do you want to put at the bottom of your emails?
[01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:40.940]  Anyway, I always thought that was great about jobs. So I believe it about Tim Cook and I think it's great that he uses the iPad
[01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:47.980]  But my question and it was prompted by the the great contra on twitter
[01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:55.820]  Aka calendar notions one of the great anonymous
[01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:59.180]  Or pseudonymous, I guess Twitter Twitter personalities
[01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:06.380]  Does IBM CEO Gini Rometty use an iPhone and
[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:12.620]  I'm totally serious when I say that I think that's an interesting and telling, you know question
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:16.860]  Do you agree that I think that would be interesting to know the answer to?
[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:23.020]  It's if you could actually trust the answer like, you know, if they just gave it in a in a press statement. Oh, yes
[01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:28.320]  I've been I use my phone like then you know, that's probably BS. Who knows but if you actually could get like authoritative
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:34.060]  Like trustworthy information that says oh, yeah. Yeah, they've been using an iPhone for for, you know months or years or whatever
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:36.940]  That's interesting to know
[01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:41.100]  But it's I think it's a little it's a little bit less interesting because
[01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:47.740]  IVM doesn't make phones do they right? So it's well, let's do that. But right
[01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:51.980]  But I don't know I I think you're right though like that that could show a level of caring
[01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:54.700]  That like, you know, if the CEO
[01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:57.260]  Doesn't even use an iPhone
[01:18:57.260 --> 01:19:02.060]  How committed is you know, how much does this new partnership really matter?
[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:04.380]  Like what is this really likely to actually go anywhere or not?
[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:08.780]  You know if the CEO doesn't care deeply enough to even try it themselves
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:14.700]  Right, and if their own enterprise because you know IBM itself is is like
[01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:17.580]  It's like a fractal like where their their business is
[01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:20.140]  you know consulting and
[01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:25.180]  Services for the enterprise but they themselves are like the canonical enterprise, right?
[01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:28.620]  If they're not good enough for their own enterprise needs then you know
[01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:36.220]  right because they themselves are a massive company with very large needs and and the conservative, you know, they're
[01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:41.420]  Technically conservative not politically conservative, you know, but that that they still use
[01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:44.300]  Lotus notes and stuff like that. Well, they make those notes
[01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:46.860]  Well, and they still use it
[01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:53.740]  Yeah, and and and again and and I think that I think their conservatism technically I mean partly that's what they sell
[01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:58.940]  That that is their product. It is also their culture and that's that's why I think this is interesting at all
[01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:03.020]  You know if if Apple had a partnership with somebody smaller or somebody more dynamic
[01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:06.780]  It would it would be less interesting the fact that they're partnering with IBM
[01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:11.180]  is more interesting because it is so
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:13.820]  opposite of what you would expect
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:20.300]  But then when they explain it and they say oh well, you know, we have no overlap this makes sense then it's like, okay
[01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:23.820]  Yeah, I kind of get that. Okay, that that does kind of make sense. Yeah, I don't know
[01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:28.620]  I just think it would be telling like I said, I don't think if it turns out she doesn't if she uses something else
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:33.260]  You know, which my question though is at this point
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:36.780]  in time and maybe that's telling about the state of of
[01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:40.540]  The mobile, you know world how crazy is it in a way?
[01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:46.780]  It seems crazy to think that the president or the CEO of IBM uses an Apple iPhone as her phone
[01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:50.940]  Well, what else should she use? Yeah, exactly. What else should she use?
[01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:59.100]  Blackberry, I you know blackberry is you know clearly on the way out and just can't do things that people expect to do on a mobile
[01:20:59.100 --> 01:20:59.820]  platform
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:03.500]  Right. Yeah, I would say like two years ago blackberry would have still been a plausible guess
[01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:05.260]  Right to like and like two years ago
[01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:09.660]  There was probably still a lot of like, you know quote business people who are still clinging to their blackberries
[01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:11.660]  I have to imagine today
[01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:16.460]  it's getting much more rare to see a battery actually in use by somebody who like
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:20.460]  By somebody who just bought a new phone. It's like yeah, I got a new phone yesterday
[01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:25.260]  It's a new blackberry like how often do you ever see that even even now in the business community?
[01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:27.260]  I have to imagine that's extremely rare
[01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:31.500]  Yeah, i've i've never seen somebody using the touch screen blackberries
[01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:37.100]  Yeah, neither have I and I you know, I don't fly frequently but I fly frequently enough and I you know
[01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:42.380]  That would be a place where I would spot it and i'd never seen it. I still see people with the the buttony ones but
[01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:48.780]  Fewer and fewer. Yeah, they're dying out quickly. Well, it's it's so it's possible. She uses a blackberry
[01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:53.980]  It's I would guess it's probable. She at least used to use a blackberry. So maybe she used a blackberry
[01:21:53.980 --> 01:22:00.300]  So maybe she's still holding out but it you know, wouldn't that be a distressing sign though that that the ceo of ibm
[01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:04.220]  Is still holding on to a blackberry, which is clearly a dying platform
[01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:07.820]  What else android? I don't think so. Why would it make sense?
[01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:13.580]  Why would it make any more sense for the president of ibm to be using a android phone than?
[01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:18.620]  An iphone, I mean if anything I think it would make the most sense for the president of ibm to use one of those like
[01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:24.060]  Stallman phones, it's just all linux and crazy stuff like do they still exist people still try to make those
[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:27.900]  I think there's people trying to make them, but I don't think that they would work in the enterprise at all
[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:31.980]  I mean, I think there's a security angle there, but I don't think there's an integration with
[01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:38.220]  You know all the software that they have to integrate with that's going to happen can those even get certified or run on a network
[01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:40.860]  I don't even know probably not
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:44.220]  That's probably incompatible with being open source. I bet they can't do it
[01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:49.500]  Yeah, I don't know about that. I don't think so. I've never heard of any company that's that's using those
[01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:54.780]  It seems to me like the people who that appeals to are security experts, you know, yeah, and I think there's a that's a
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:23:01.740]  It's a very small niche. Yeah, it's a great argument for but it's not I don't think it's something that ibm would use. Yeah or standardize on
[01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:08.700]  You know and there's a bunch of people on twitter who answered my question and said that they don't know but that there are people
[01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:10.700]  In ibm using iphones and that they don't know
[01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:15.340]  But that there are people in ibm using iphones and that there's a lot of people who work at ibm
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:21.900]  Who use ipads on a regular basis that there is a lot of dog fooding in that regard within ibm
[01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:24.700]  You know, it makes sense ibm
[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:29.740]  The what most people think of them as is not what they do anymore, you know
[01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:34.460]  most people think of their days as a computer manufacturer, right and
[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:38.780]  That is not their business anymore. They have gotten rid of I believe that entire business
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:40.780]  I don't think they have any parts of it left. Nope. Um,
[01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:46.620]  They are a services. They're an enterprise services company. And so they might do servers, but I
[01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:50.220]  Don't think it's more of that anymore. I haven't seen an ibm server for sale in a long time
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:55.340]  Well, and if they do I think it's I think it counts more as consulting than server sales
[01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:59.020]  Yeah, you know I think that and I think when you buy if it's if they have them
[01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:02.700]  I'll bet it costs way more for the service contract and everything than the actual hardware
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:06.300]  Yeah, and like I I don't think you can just go buy one ibm server from amazon
[01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:11.340]  Like I think you'd have to like yeah, it'd be involved. Anyway, so, you know, they have all these like services
[01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:18.300]  You know, they they will they will contract to your business to build your crm system for you like stuff like that
[01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:20.300]  Like that's or you can use
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:25.740]  A big lotus notes installation. Yeah, I mean and I don't know most of what they do because I'm not in that industry
[01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:28.780]  but that's that's like the high-level version of it basically and uh
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:32.780]  And it's like if that's your business
[01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:39.340]  Then yeah, it helps it helps to some degree to primarily sell your stuff when you have something in in a certain market
[01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:41.340]  You know, you know if they have their own
[01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:47.980]  Their own document management server then it makes sense for them to sell that as much as they can as as part of these deals
[01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:53.820]  But if the business world is demanding integration with ios devices
[01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:59.980]  And if they don't sell ios devices or something like ios devices, it totally makes sense for them to
[01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:06.540]  Address the demand and not be religious about it not be like oh we can't deal with them because you know
[01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:08.540]  They're apple and we used to be enemies
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:13.100]  you know, they the fact is they're not enemies now, uh, and
[01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:19.980]  I'm apple and ibm are in extremely different positions now than where they both were respectively in the early 80s and uh
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:26.380]  And ibm is no longer like they don't they they have no reason to care whose phones they're selling anymore
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:31.580]  Right, and in fact, well, I don't think they should care that it's any one particular one
[01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:37.260]  But I can see why it would appeal to them to sell apple because apple, you know is is a single source
[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:42.220]  That would make it easier for them than if they did. We're doing the same thing with android. All right
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:46.220]  And and if there's demand in these companies, you know the same way that so many people
[01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:50.540]  You know brought in iphones because they wanted to and they made the company support them afterwards
[01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:55.580]  If if there are compelling reasons for companies whether it's employees who want to use ipads
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:26:01.100]  Employees who already are using them anyway and want them to work better and be more integrated at the company's networks and stuff
[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:08.620]  Or just you know things like deploying custom ios devices as part of you know, the ups guy tools or whatever
[01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:15.820]  If if the businesses are demanding that stuff it is in ibm's best interest to work with apple to
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:21.820]  To offer that to integrate that into the contract and the services they're providing otherwise because that's what their customers are demanding
[01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:25.340]  yeah, maybe it you know part of the fallout of this is
[01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:28.140]  Isn't really even about apple at all
[01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:34.220]  But really about the way that ibm is not the ibm we've always thought of and I knew that but this is just sort of
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:36.060]  Crystallizing it
[01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:41.740]  I mean the only people who should be upset about this are microsoft because this this is their business before this is exactly like
[01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:47.020]  This is the business that that i've argued for a while that microsoft should be getting into more heavily
[01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:49.020]  They already have a very strong enterprise division
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:52.060]  and and certainly I I assume
[01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:56.620]  I I don't know this for sure, but i'm sure microsoft is is probably
[01:26:57.820 --> 01:27:01.660]  Ibm's biggest competitor for enterprise services that might not be true. Certainly they're up there
[01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:06.780]  And enterprise services are a great business for that kind of thing because it's a big profitable
[01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:13.660]  Relatively stable industry to be in compared to consumer tech which is very hard and fickle and low margin usually so right
[01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:15.740]  so, you know
[01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:19.260]  Microsoft should this is what microsoft should be doing but they're not
[01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:21.980]  for various reasons
[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:23.980]  and I think
[01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:30.380]  More than more than anything. It's a sign of the times not that apple and ibm are working together
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:32.860]  But that there's a major
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:38.300]  Enterprise partnership that does not involve microsoft at all. Yeah. Well, that should be scarier to them
[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:46.460]  And not just the partnership but that that that the landscape is changing in a way that such a partnership could exist without
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:51.180]  Microsoft at all exactly because even if microsoft weren't involved at the enterprise sales level
[01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:57.340]  It still up until very recently still would have implicitly meant
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:01.180]  Everybody who would have been involved in the enterprise
[01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:08.380]  Was getting a windows pc and the custom office license the custom app that was being written would be a windows app
[01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:09.900]  exactly
[01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:14.620]  and and or at the very least would be an app that runs on windows because maybe
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:19.820]  A small part of the trend over the last decade has been web apps, you know, even in the enterprise
[01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:24.540]  But of course, you know windows isn't cut off from that right and there are all those web maps usually run in i.e
[01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:27.180]  In these businesses, right? But once you're talking about
[01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:33.180]  Ios apps now you're talking about something where microsoft is just completely out of the out of the loop
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:34.140]  Yeah, they're cut out
[01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:42.140]  They are completely irrelevant to to the solutions that like any any any product or solution that apple and ibm will work on together
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:45.660]  Will almost certainly not involve anything from microsoft at all
[01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:50.700]  It will almost certainly only serve to make microsoft stuff irrelevant and and and unnecessary
[01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:55.660]  Yeah, like I said before that microsoft is not a product of Microsoft at all
[01:28:55.660 --> 01:29:01.500]  Yeah, I like I said before this I think this is all upside for apple and every additional every time this works
[01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:06.060]  And ibm makes one of these deals that gets ipads and iphones into an enterprise. It's all
[01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:11.500]  Upside for apple it's iphones and ipads. They they'll they will sell now that they wouldn't have sold before
[01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:14.540]  Maybe it'll be a huge increase. Maybe it'll be like
[01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:21.500]  You know five percent increase in ipad and iphone sales six seven eight percent. I don't know. Maybe it'll be small
[01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:26.060]  Maybe one percent but everyone that sold is upside but at the same time it's almost
[01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:33.020]  probable that everyone is a loss for microsoft right because these these are all tasks that
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:38.380]  Microsoft stuff was was mostly was almost all used for before all right, maybe with the phones
[01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:40.700]  It's not because microsoft never really had a big phone
[01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:42.220]  thing
[01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:44.540]  But people are now using their phones for things
[01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:49.680]  They previously used to have to use a laptop for it and certainly anything that you use an ipad for in these situations
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:52.560]  Is something that would have otherwise been a windows pc?
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:55.120]  Yeah, oh definitely
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:58.240]  And I think that's that's really really a big deal
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:05.600]  Yeah, this is this is probably one of those things where you know in a year we're gonna we're gonna we will have forgotten about it
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:11.040]  But then like in five years we might look back on this and say oh that that was the start of of a big shift
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:17.360]  Yeah, and I think we'll probably see it like me and you who don't enter the enterprise at all physically
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:19.360]  Uh
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:22.480]  I don't think they would let us in at this point. Yeah, I don't think so either
[01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:28.800]  Even if we wanted to we couldn't get in. All right, we would encounter it in as slides and a tim cook keynote
[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:33.140]  Where instead of instead of talking about what percentage of fortune 500?
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:35.120]  um
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:42.400]  Are using ios devices it's going to switch to something like percentage of mobile devices in fortune 500 company, right?
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:48.800]  That yeah, because that's something they've never talked about but if that becomes a sizable number that could be huge
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:50.640]  right
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:58.640]  Like even if apple just gets 20 20 of all mobile devices in fortune 500 companies, that's enormous because it's also almost certainly
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:04.080]  The most expensive 20 of the mobile devices in the fortune 500 company almost certainly
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:11.680]  You know and that's how apple that's exactly how apples come to dominate the revenue and profits in the consumer and in the consumer side
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:15.120]  Of the market is just by taking the 20 percent where the most money is
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:17.920]  Yeah, it seems to be working well so far
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:20.160]  Pretty good strategy
[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:23.040]  All right. I wanted to keep this show short. So let's let's wrap it up
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:25.600]  All right, anything else you wanted to talk about anything else on your mind this week?
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:29.520]  No, i'm just trying to get through now, uh 1147 emails
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:33.760]  So what was the count for the episode? I think about 60 something like that
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:39.200]  Yeah, and the good thing is for the listeners that uh
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:41.200]  Because of the way that both of us talk
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:45.760]  I would expect this episode to be about 45 minutes shorter in overcast
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:51.200]  I think we're gonna have to split it in two but you'll still save the both
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:58.080]  You'll still save the 45 minutes as you get through both episodes. You're gonna really boost the the smart speed total stats with this episode
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:07.600]  Where can I go to find out more the website is overcast dot
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:10.720]  Fm. Yep. All right, the twitter account
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:13.600]  Is overcast fm. Yep
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:18.100]  And of course you are at uh, marco.org
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:22.720]  That's right. Uh marco armen's on uh on twitter
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:28.160]  You can save save five characters and you're just marco on uh,
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.880]  What was the other thing we were using for twitter oh, yeah app.net yeah, is that still up
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:36.880]  Is that still up?
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:40.480]  I really wanted that to work, but I think it was hopeless from the start, honestly
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:44.880]  I think it had it had a good run like it had a longer run than I expected for it
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:51.360]  But uh, you guys had a great dissection post-mortem and sadly, I think post-mortem is the right word
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:55.520]  um an atp about it and that it's it was I think it was sort of an
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:33:02.160]  Uh, you know and you can apply you can circle back to what we were talking about with free apps and paid apps and stuff
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:06.240]  Like that, but there's something about a social network where pay first was just never going to work
[01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:10.800]  And never it's also it's very hard for a social network
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:13.440]  To have something else created that is
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:16.480]  Extremely similar to one that's already successful
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:22.960]  To have that new one take off like it has to be like app.net was not different enough from twitter
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:27.840]  And I know they thought they were but the but the product that most people saw wasn't
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:33.680]  Yeah, you know that's a that's a common problem when you're on the inside of a product or service is that you're so intimately familiar
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:40.720]  with it that you can you sense in your bones that you're different enough to matter, but if if that
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:46.320]  But yeah, and you you're right. I'll bet they're right. I think that they're a hundred percent right that they were different enough to matter
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:54.560]  But sadly it wasn't different enough in a way that was obvious from the outside and so thus to everybody else it didn't matter
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:34:00.320]  Yeah, exactly. It's a very common problem though. Yeah, and you keep yelling to yourself in your head. No, look
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:03.840]  It's like youtube for dog videos. It's totally different than youtube
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:07.200]  And you're everyone's like, well, why don't we just put our dog videos on youtube?
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.160]  Yeah, it's it's exactly the same problem
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:15.680]  Well and part of it like you could build weird other apps that were built on the app net
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:22.080]  Infrastructure that you could never build on twitter, but correct. Yeah, but but that was all stuff that was not only added later
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:24.960]  But also stuff that was just it just never got a foothold
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:30.960]  It wasn't really addressing pressing need that a lot of people had and the whole model of like having to pay for an account
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:32.960]  For so long before they had the free thing
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:38.560]  Yeah, it never gave people a reason to sign up for it and it never gave the people who did sign up a reason to keep using it
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:42.800]  And it never gave developers enough of a reason to require it
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:44.400]  to
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:50.880]  build those cool promised apps on it like the the cost of requiring it was so high because you you don't have to
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:55.040]  So high because you you then have all your customers who had then get app net accounts
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:57.920]  Like it was it was a big burden to place on on
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:34:59.840]  those apps
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:05.600]  So that very few apps ever got made for it that were compelling. Yeah, and by the time they came out it was too late
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:10.800]  Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think their best chance at that point was if twitter had imploded
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:17.520]  In terms of you know, like the way that there was like the sense that the twitter was really burning all of the
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:20.880]  The bridges with third-party app developers, right?
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:29.120]  Like if let's say twitter just completely pulled the plug on third-party apis and it was used the official twitter client or don't use twitter at all
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:33.440]  There's a chance that some number of us might have switched a lot of our daily
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:39.360]  Chitter chatter to app.net now that we still wouldn't I I think it would take a bigger
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:46.880]  Implosion than that like I think if twitter did what facebook does now with their timelines where all right facebook facebook like you can't
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:52.000]  I don't combine combine it with the combine it with nuking the third-party apis
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:58.640]  They use the third-party apis. And the reason they nuke the third-party apis is they want to do twitter facebook like things with the feed
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:02.880]  Right where like they they don't show you everything that you want to be seeing
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:06.480]  And they show that way they don't want to see right and that way they can then
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:10.640]  Go to business accounts and say oh even though you've earned a million followers
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:14.240]  Based on your merit and what people had people who want to hear from you
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:18.000]  We're only going to show about 10 of them what you post unless you pay us
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:20.400]  that's what facebook does
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:21.360]  and
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:24.960]  yeah, if and and it confuses the crap out of people on facebook, but they don't care because
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:28.560]  You know facebook was never a great place to follow what was being posted
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:34.560]  If twitter did something like that that fundamentally changes the way the product works
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:37.040]  Uh, then that might anger enough people like us
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:43.840]  Uh to leave but it would take some but even that like even that example might not be enough it
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:49.760]  You have to like really do something majorly messing up your product and permanently messing up your product
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:53.040]  Before enough people would leave to make a difference
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:58.960]  Well, I think there was a time, you know a year ago where it seemed like twitter might have been not teetering on the edge
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:00.640]  of that but maybe
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:07.680]  Looking longingly in that direction and you know stroking their collective chin and thinking hmm, maybe
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:09.600]  uh
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:15.280]  I still wouldn't put it past them. I mean, yeah twitter like god knows what twitter will do next month like it's always
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:18.480]  It's such a crap shoe. Their their leadership has been so
[01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:24.080]  Irratic yeah and erratic is a great word for it. It's like you never know what twitter's gonna do
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:27.280]  They they've always had this great product. That was
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:31.360]  That could be made into a much more monetizable product by ruining it
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:36.960]  and so far they've kind of walked the line of trying to only minimally ruin it and
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:40.720]  They they fundamentally don't understand their own value. Nope
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:47.040]  And they also don't I think they also fundamentally don't value their own employees because there are some great people
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:51.120]  Working at twitter, you know people who have been working there and have left
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:58.640]  People who I know are still there on the design teams who are you know, just have great track records and clearly aren't being
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:07.200]  You know listen to and not and aren't given enough authority over the direction of product yeah, it's
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:15.280]  I'm i'm shocked at how that company continues to operate given how badly it seems to be led most of the time. Yeah
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:18.560]  I totally agree
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:20.560]  I totally agree. Um
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:23.280]  Longest wrap-up ever. Yeah, right
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:27.840]  Now I might as well just tack on the uh, the atp theme song
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:31.680]  Well, then we talk for another 45 minutes afterwards exactly
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:36.100]  Uh, I think my single favorite tweet I saw today about overcast
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:38.400]  Was somebody I don't know who it was
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:44.640]  But somebody sent you a fake screenshot where there's the um, there's a setting where you can you can set how long?
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:46.480]  the
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:52.880]  Fast forward goes. Yeah, and and they said I thought it would have been like this and it says 15 seconds 30 seconds
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:57.200]  60 seconds and then the last option is however long the atp theme song
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:04.880]  That was that was that was very good god, I got to look it up and and put it in the show notes
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:09.360]  I think I retweeted it so you could probably find it there. All right, I will find it there. Thank you. Marco arment. You've been
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:16.500]  Uh quadruply kind with your time any time. All right. Good luck with the uh overcast. Thanks
[01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:38.500]  Thanks. All right. I'm hitting stop. You are a saint. We should never be allowed to podcast together
