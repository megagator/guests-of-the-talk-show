[00:00.000 --> 00:04.720]  let me just say right off the bat that i'm not sure i've ever seen a book that spoils itself
[00:05.280 --> 00:13.040]  based on the subtitle alone by that you mean it's easy to judge it by the cover and dismiss it or
[00:13.040 --> 00:19.520]  what well not dismiss it but it there's the the cover is very opinionated and to me
[00:20.240 --> 00:29.120]  this is and reading the book i think it's quite it's it's certainly an uh intriguing title and
[00:29.120 --> 00:35.520]  maybe you know i i'm not i've never written a book so i don't know how titling and subtitling
[00:35.520 --> 00:41.920]  a book goes into projected sales and stuff like that and i can imagine that there's some idea that
[00:41.920 --> 00:47.760]  with that subtitle the book might spark more interest right off the shelf than if it was
[00:47.760 --> 00:55.840]  just called after steve with no no lost its sole part or after steve how apple became a trillion
[00:55.840 --> 01:03.920]  dollar company right it's the lost its soul is the hmm that's that's pretty sharp right right and
[01:04.880 --> 01:09.520]  i what you know it's funny you you when you go into the contract phase with the book or at least
[01:09.520 --> 01:13.200]  in this case in my experience and i literally only have one experience because i've only
[01:13.200 --> 01:17.920]  written one book it wasn't like the title was there you know the title was born out of
[01:17.920 --> 01:24.080]  really deep thought about what the structure of the book should be and what the book should
[01:24.080 --> 01:31.360]  should be about and what story it was going to tell so it it the contract didn't didn't dictate
[01:31.360 --> 01:35.520]  the year wasn't based on the title so it's interesting to think about like oh well the
[01:35.520 --> 01:41.520]  title is designed to get sales i honestly like in my mind that's a bit of an afterthought the
[01:41.520 --> 01:47.760]  title is more designed to reflect the reporting in the book but also be provocative enough that
[01:47.760 --> 01:54.320]  people look at it and say like well that that's that seems interesting it at least made me think
[01:54.320 --> 02:00.560]  or have some feeling some people have said like the book made them angry or riled them up and they
[02:00.560 --> 02:05.760]  you know they were they said that that would be the case in their eyes and whether you loved apple
[02:05.760 --> 02:11.200]  or had issues with apple which i'd rather people feel feel one way or the other after reading it
[02:11.200 --> 02:17.120]  then just kind of set it aside when they're done i get the feeling yeah i've you know i'm sure
[02:17.120 --> 02:22.240]  you're hearing it more than me as the author but i've heard that there are people who are not happy
[02:22.240 --> 02:26.960]  about the book just just just a general sense but i don't know that that again that's not a
[02:26.960 --> 02:35.520]  condemnation of the book maybe any properly written book about this era about a secretive
[02:35.520 --> 02:41.120]  very secretive company if the book is well reported it's going to report things that the
[02:41.120 --> 02:45.760]  comp you know people did not want to be public and therefore it's of course it's going to make
[02:45.760 --> 02:50.320]  them angry or not angry you know maybe angry is the wrong word but just wish that the book didn't
[02:50.320 --> 02:56.400]  exist right right i mean you're yeah you're writing about it you know corporation that
[02:56.400 --> 03:00.720]  really has what i call a corporate emerita right that you know everybody who kind of goes in and
[03:00.720 --> 03:05.120]  out of apple believes that you don't talk about apple and you know you can certainly
[03:05.760 --> 03:13.200]  if you're an alumni of of apple you can be become a pariah if you violate those kind of basic
[03:13.200 --> 03:20.080]  principles and so you're kind of as a reporter or writer when you when you unearth things i just
[03:20.080 --> 03:24.560]  always felt like well that's just not appreciated because it violates the very the very kind of
[03:24.560 --> 03:30.800]  foundation of the way they think about how they reveal information to the world so as background
[03:30.800 --> 03:36.240]  for people who aren't familiar with your byline you currently are a reporter for the new york
[03:36.240 --> 03:42.640]  times but previously you were at the wall street journal correct correct and much much of this
[03:42.640 --> 03:48.000]  this book is born out of my reporting while i was at the wall street journal and when you were at
[03:48.000 --> 03:55.920]  the journal your beat exactly was was it the silicon valley in general i mean i know i know
[03:55.920 --> 04:00.640]  you personally from a couple of apple events i know we were introduced i think by steve dowling
[04:00.640 --> 04:07.840]  we met when you did a talk show at wdc several years ago i was i was talking with i think it was
[04:07.840 --> 04:12.480]  your audio producer a little bit about some of the app experience because i think he was
[04:12.480 --> 04:18.480]  am i correct and remembering remembering that he did a documentary about about app developers and
[04:18.480 --> 04:24.000]  some of the challenges that they'd run into and dealing with with the 30 fees or something like
[04:24.000 --> 04:29.120]  that anyway i i recall being there for one of the talk shows and having a chance to talk with you
[04:29.120 --> 04:34.720]  before before you did the big show and like it was such a thrill to be there and see just how
[04:34.720 --> 04:39.200]  how packed the house was for that i mean people just really turned out for it it was it was fun
[04:39.200 --> 04:44.480]  to see yeah it'll be interesting to see when or if that ever happens again that was uh the
[04:44.480 --> 04:49.760]  documentary for those i'll just toss it out there before i forget app the human story by jake
[04:49.760 --> 04:58.240]  shoemaker and it yeah he he for years shot the video version of of the show and i say it in the
[04:58.240 --> 05:02.800]  past tense but it could happen in the future tense at some point again but i do remember that but
[05:02.800 --> 05:08.480]  what was your purview was it just was it super focused on apple strictly strictly apple the
[05:08.480 --> 05:12.960]  journal has an apple reporter the times has an apple reporter Reuters Reuters has an apple
[05:12.960 --> 05:19.600]  reporter i mean there there are you know there's a sensibility here among large papers that these
[05:19.600 --> 05:25.840]  large companies have such outsized influence over over our lives in the world that you really need
[05:25.840 --> 05:30.560]  at least a single reporter devoted to it and in the case of amazon the journal has a couple of
[05:30.560 --> 05:35.840]  reporters and in the case of facebook i think there are probably about four people that hand off
[05:35.840 --> 05:40.400]  coverage of facebook at the journal and i think that's just a reflection of its its impact on
[05:40.400 --> 05:46.640]  society yeah Bloomberg of course has Mark Gurman amongst others who cover the apple beat i kind of
[05:46.640 --> 05:50.880]  knew that but you know i feel like it's worth clarifying but so here's my next question and
[05:50.880 --> 05:58.960]  it's a meta discussion you you are a full-time reporter for a major publication and your beat
[05:58.960 --> 06:05.520]  is apple but you have the idea that you would like to write a book about apple how how do you draw
[06:05.520 --> 06:12.000]  the line between what you're reporting for the paper and what you're reporting to collect for
[06:12.000 --> 06:20.400]  the book the line's actually pretty clear and well defined and in this instance it was it was
[06:21.040 --> 06:27.520]  uh you take a sabbatical essentially a book leave i took mine in summer of 2020 and took
[06:27.520 --> 06:32.800]  about seven months off and that's when i really rolled up my sleeves and did a lot of the reporting
[06:32.800 --> 06:37.760]  that's in this book now there's other reporting that's in the book that that anybody who may have
[06:37.760 --> 06:45.120]  read stories over the years from the wall street journal can can tease out is is based or was in
[06:45.120 --> 06:49.600]  articles that the journal had at the time when i like when i was covering apple like for example
[06:49.600 --> 06:54.960]  there's there's a guy in app inside apple called the blevenator tony blevens is just a master
[06:54.960 --> 07:01.840]  negotiator and i wrote a profile of tony blevens while i was at the journal and there's a few pages
[07:01.840 --> 07:08.480]  that highlight some of his work at apple so it's it it does kind of blend and overlap but really
[07:09.040 --> 07:13.760]  the writing and the bulk of the reporting took place in that seven month period that i took off
[07:13.760 --> 07:18.880]  on on book leave and how again i i'm fascinated by stuff like this and i don't want to spend
[07:19.440 --> 07:24.640]  a ton of time about i want to talk about the actual content but i'm curious what because
[07:24.640 --> 07:32.560]  there is a ton here's my favorite thing about the book the book is clearly deeply researched and i
[07:32.560 --> 07:36.320]  mean do you have a count of how many actual sources i think maybe in the forward you mentioned
[07:36.320 --> 07:44.160]  how many how many people it's it's it's 200 plus and that's that spans former and current apple
[07:44.160 --> 07:50.880]  employees friends family of the two central characters johnny i've and tim cook advisors
[07:50.880 --> 07:58.240]  to apple consultants i mean it's it's it's a real cross section of of the world in and around the
[07:58.240 --> 08:08.400]  company and it shows it really does and it is a a nourishing read in terms of how deeply reported
[08:08.400 --> 08:13.120]  it is i think you know as we mentioned at the outset i think that you and i could possibly
[08:13.120 --> 08:20.160]  quibble about the punditry aspect of it the the whether or not apple has lost its soul
[08:20.160 --> 08:24.320]  but i don't think and i think this is what i'm saying to my list the listeners of the show
[08:24.320 --> 08:32.880]  if if if the idea of how apple lost its soul immediately turns one's mind like hmm is this
[08:32.880 --> 08:39.520]  book a hit piece i would say it is not it is and you know reasonable people might reasonably
[08:39.520 --> 08:44.640]  disagree about like i said the punditry aspect of it but the reporting aspect is fascinating
[08:44.640 --> 08:50.800]  and there's a so much new stuff in here and first-hand stuff that it's sort of again i know
[08:50.800 --> 08:54.720]  you're not going to give up confidential sources so i'm not even going to ask but there are some
[08:54.720 --> 08:59.200]  anecdotes that are relayed in here where it's like who could pop you know there could not have been
[08:59.200 --> 09:05.840]  that many people in that meeting who spoke to trip about this it's it's pretty it shows
[09:07.120 --> 09:14.080]  yeah well it was designed to be to be a real narrative non-fiction as well so you know to
[09:14.080 --> 09:20.400]  to have real arc and to bring the reader forward and to have broad appeal so you know my hope is
[09:20.400 --> 09:28.000]  that there's something in here for for people who follow apple closely and for people who don't i
[09:28.000 --> 09:33.440]  mean you know if if your listeners because you know i know most of the people who follow your
[09:33.440 --> 09:38.960]  your words on are real apple enthusiasts if their family members don't understand why they're
[09:38.960 --> 09:43.360]  enthusiastic about the company or don't really understand apple i'm hopeful that there's
[09:43.360 --> 09:47.600]  something in here for them as well and and so it's really designed to have broad appeal
[09:49.040 --> 09:54.480]  what what tools do you use like when you're conducting 200 interviews and collecting this
[09:54.480 --> 10:02.400]  and trying to organize all of this information you you've collected through your reporting
[10:02.400 --> 10:09.040]  into a narrative what what's like what what what app what software do you use to to collect the
[10:09.040 --> 10:16.480]  notes and and sort of start organizing this or and what do you use to write i'm gonna i'm gonna
[10:16.480 --> 10:21.600]  head turn that on its ear a little bit and say that there's there's very much an aspect of this
[10:21.600 --> 10:26.800]  it's very analog and part of that was the consequence of the pandemic it was when i
[10:26.800 --> 10:31.360]  was reporting this it was a little difficult so for example when i went to robertsdale alabama
[10:31.360 --> 10:36.720]  to visit tim cook's hometown it was really hard to you know to reach out to people ahead of time
[10:36.720 --> 10:42.480]  and there was some weariness at that point you know mid-pandemic about seeing people and i i
[10:42.480 --> 10:49.520]  literally drew a map of people who went to high school with tim cook and then you know i drove
[10:49.520 --> 10:54.560]  around to their to their houses and like knocked on their doors and asked if they'd be willing to
[10:54.560 --> 11:00.240]  talk to me and left notes in their mailboxes so there's an analog aspect of this and then there's
[11:00.240 --> 11:05.520]  to your point like how do you keep track of everything else i used evernote a good bit you
[11:05.520 --> 11:09.840]  know because i i had it at the ready and i was able to to leave notes because sometimes you're
[11:09.840 --> 11:15.680]  out on a run and you're like oh you know that'd be a great sentence in chapter 20 or something
[11:15.680 --> 11:20.240]  like that and you just want to be able to punch that in really quick and then you know google
[11:20.240 --> 11:27.040]  google docs and and microsoft word actually became became a primary tool during this and
[11:27.040 --> 11:33.280]  scrivener is where i did the bulk of the writing scrivener is scrivener is a fantastic tool if
[11:33.280 --> 11:39.840]  you're embarking on a project like this scrivener i i i am familiar with scrivener and have never
[11:39.840 --> 11:43.840]  really used it personally but the one thing i've heard from people who are devoted to it is that
[11:43.840 --> 11:51.440]  it really is it's super it seems super useful for organizing a big writing project you know that it
[11:51.440 --> 11:57.600]  maybe it's not an outliner in a traditional this is a product that just does outlining but it does
[11:57.600 --> 12:07.680]  sort of let you sort of outline in a lowercase o sense of the word outlining you know this makes a
[12:07.680 --> 12:12.960]  chapter right this teddy and then that's a story and then this chapter comes before this chapter
[12:12.960 --> 12:18.480]  because that's you know it happened this way chronologically is is is that a good way of of
[12:18.480 --> 12:23.520]  putting it that's yeah that's a good way of putting it the one thing that i found most
[12:23.520 --> 12:31.840]  beneficial of using it was i at the outset of this i went back and read like every clip for major and
[12:31.840 --> 12:36.720]  even minor outlets about apple over the span of a decade and then i realized no crap i got to go
[12:36.720 --> 12:41.840]  back further and read clips about johnny and tim as well like profiling them over the years and i
[12:41.840 --> 12:47.440]  was able to put those a kind of a window off to the side and then i could open and access those
[12:47.440 --> 12:52.480]  really easily and you can have a split window where you're looking at the at the at the old
[12:52.480 --> 12:58.080]  news clip at the same time you're looking at at what you're writing so you can you can refer
[12:58.080 --> 13:04.640]  pretty quickly to to kind of source material in a seamless fashion all right let me take a break
[13:04.640 --> 13:09.760]  here and thank our first sponsors our good friends oh do i love this company linode that is where i
[13:09.760 --> 13:14.720]  host daring fireball and i don't host staring fireball linode because they're a sponsor i
[13:14.720 --> 13:20.560]  i would host them i would host there even if they cancelled all their sponsorships henceforth it is
[13:20.560 --> 13:26.720]  it i i host there because they're the best you can go to linode l i n o d e dot com slash the talk
[13:26.720 --> 13:33.760]  show and see why linode has been voted the top infrastructure as a service provider by both g2
[13:33.760 --> 13:38.880]  and trust radius they have award-winning tech support it is offered 24 hours a day seven days
[13:38.880 --> 13:45.280]  a week 365 days a year to every level of user that's not something you get when you're on like
[13:45.280 --> 13:51.200]  the big enterprise plan you can get on like their lowest consumer just a couple bucks a month plan
[13:51.200 --> 13:56.880]  and you get the same award-winning tech support as the enterprise customers who do spend a
[13:57.520 --> 14:02.240]  thousands of dollars a month to have hundreds and hundreds of servers it is very clear once
[14:02.240 --> 14:06.640]  you get to know linode why developers have been trusting them for projects both big and small
[14:06.640 --> 14:12.880]  since 2003 linode offers the best price to performance value for all compute instances
[14:12.880 --> 14:18.880]  including gpu's block storage kubernetes and their upcoming bare metal release they make cloud
[14:18.880 --> 14:25.040]  computing fast simple and affordable allowing you to focus on your projects not your infrastructure
[14:25.040 --> 14:31.760]  so visit linode.com slash the talk show by going to that url you can create a free account using
[14:31.760 --> 14:38.160]  either your google github credentials or just use your email address that's what i do and by going
[14:38.160 --> 14:46.240]  to linode.com slash the talk show you get 100 bucks in credit 100 there's i i what let's start
[14:46.240 --> 14:54.000]  with the the the sort of structure of the book is sort of a sort of a dual biography right like
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.480]  the two main characters are clearly i mean you can see from the cover it's cook and johnny iv
[14:58.480 --> 15:04.960]  right correct what i i like to think of it as like it's like three biographies in a way it's like
[15:04.960 --> 15:10.720]  a corporate history of you know a biography of apple and its totality so there may be some
[15:10.720 --> 15:16.960]  material that's very familiar to so many real listeners but then also hopefully ample fresh
[15:16.960 --> 15:24.480]  material and a fresh look at both tim and johnny themselves the after steve jobs died there was and
[15:24.480 --> 15:31.600]  you know it you mentioned all the you know the previous examples disney polaroid with edmund
[15:31.600 --> 15:37.840]  land who else companies with a strong founder sony so sony would be the other one that you
[15:37.840 --> 15:42.640]  know i mean these are all intimately familiar to jobs himself just because of his you know
[15:43.760 --> 15:50.640]  knowing the the leaders of sony admiring edwin land and upbraiding polaroid for throwing him
[15:50.640 --> 15:55.120]  out of the company and then in the case of disney being a large shareholder he was intimately
[15:55.120 --> 15:59.760]  familiar with their own struggles after after walt stuff right and you know obviously became
[15:59.760 --> 16:10.240]  you know just sort of not really coincidentally but the way that with pixar like one of my one of
[16:10.240 --> 16:16.720]  my recurring themes like to me it's it's the story of this whole last few decades of what we now call
[16:16.720 --> 16:23.360]  big tech is the sort of computerization of everything like computers are so powerful and
[16:23.360 --> 16:28.560]  so profound that just about everything that could be a computer is becoming a computer and something
[16:28.560 --> 16:36.080]  like making an animated movie has gone from being this incredibly labor-intensive hand analog thing
[16:36.080 --> 16:43.200]  right like where the classic disney animation from the 20th century was drawn by artists at a desk on
[16:43.200 --> 16:50.800]  actual cell you know it was very analog to purely computer driven but that you know famously as we
[16:50.800 --> 16:57.440]  all know now drove jobs to have a relationship with with disney so his you know familiarity
[16:57.440 --> 17:05.200]  with that company was was more than just uh superficial absolutely yeah it's funny you say
[17:05.200 --> 17:11.120]  that i actually read an article for if you'll forgive a brief digression about people mistakenly
[17:11.120 --> 17:15.600]  turning sabbath mode on their ovens and getting locked out of their ovens because your oven's
[17:15.600 --> 17:20.080]  essentially a computer now too so and for those who don't know sabbath mode is designed for
[17:20.640 --> 17:26.480]  observant jews to be able to kind of maintain a temperature through the sabbath and through holy
[17:26.480 --> 17:31.040]  holy celebrations and there were there were i guess people who warned you i should have
[17:31.040 --> 17:35.600]  accidentally pushed the button and all of a sudden couldn't get back into their oven so yeah computers
[17:35.600 --> 17:41.520]  are everywhere i've i mentioned that recently when i was talking about the apple's new studio display
[17:41.520 --> 17:47.120]  which itself is like an ios computer or like an apple tv like it actually the display runs an
[17:47.120 --> 17:52.560]  operating system and gets firmware updates which is kind of mind-blowing but you know it's easy to
[17:52.560 --> 17:58.080]  understand why but a couple of weeks ago my review unit the the audio was glitching out it it you know
[17:58.080 --> 18:04.720]  it has these great speakers but everything i was playing was just like that it it you know like
[18:04.720 --> 18:10.400]  that type of audio and i unplugged it from the computer i did everything i could other than
[18:10.400 --> 18:14.800]  unplug it from the wall but that's ultimately what i had to do and then you plug it back in
[18:14.800 --> 18:19.360]  and it actually boots up you know like like when your apple tv starts up it doesn't take a long
[18:19.360 --> 18:24.960]  time it's it's not like a full version of ios takes but still you don't think of a monitor as
[18:24.960 --> 18:30.400]  being this thing that has to boot right the computer boots and you see it boot but now the
[18:30.400 --> 18:35.120]  the display itself boots and my analogy was my my refrigerator you know if that's how apple's
[18:35.120 --> 18:40.640]  going to make this they should and they don't want to put a power button on it which is a very apple
[18:40.640 --> 18:47.360]  like thing to do they should be damn sure it doesn't need to be yanked out of the wall socket
[18:47.360 --> 18:52.160]  you know like my refrigerator is also a computer i've got a little touch screen in there you can
[18:52.160 --> 18:57.200]  control how much ice it makes and set the temperature and stuff like that and you know
[18:57.200 --> 19:01.920]  we've had this refrigerator now for over five years i've never had to pull the pull the plug
[19:01.920 --> 19:07.600]  on it you know that's that's what you expect from a refrigerator yeah well you're lucky you haven't
[19:07.600 --> 19:11.840]  had to pull the plug i bet it'll happen at some point you know that that that's that's where we're
[19:11.840 --> 19:18.880]  headed i guess with the computerization of everything so how how how quickly did you narrow
[19:19.520 --> 19:27.120]  the idea down to telling the story of cook and johnny i've it it's a bit reductive but
[19:28.080 --> 19:35.440]  i've seen other people argue but it's also i think the the most effective way to understand
[19:35.440 --> 19:42.400]  what jobs had in mind for apple you know after he left and it's also there there's certainly
[19:42.400 --> 19:49.600]  stand-ins for the two the two poles inside apple that make apple so successful as a company and
[19:49.600 --> 19:54.880]  that's this this creative aspect of the company that's been such a force and come up with so many
[19:54.880 --> 20:00.720]  revolutionary product ideas and revolutionary advertisements and everything else and that's
[20:00.720 --> 20:06.320]  where jobs spent so much of its time and then the operational side of the company that's that's
[20:06.320 --> 20:11.680]  been able to you know take the hand off of the designs and and engineering and and make those
[20:11.680 --> 20:17.840]  products come to life not just like you know one perfect product but like a hundred million plus
[20:17.840 --> 20:23.120]  products coming off a factory line i mean that's that's a remarkable uh achievement and very few
[20:23.120 --> 20:29.120]  companies can do that and almost none can do it at the level that apple does i've heard from
[20:29.120 --> 20:36.800]  a few friends uh who've who've made the i forget what they call i think internally there's some
[20:36.800 --> 20:43.200]  kind of name for it but the the san francisco to china flights you know and there was a story
[20:43.200 --> 20:50.400]  remember the story a couple of years ago where one of the airlines seemingly thoughtlessly leaked
[20:50.400 --> 20:57.200]  that you know like that apple has like a standing order of like 100 business class seats every day
[20:57.200 --> 21:03.520]  on the on the flights across the pacific ocean oh and united yeah yeah yeah yeah there's a rumor at
[21:03.520 --> 21:07.360]  one point that they were buying out entire planes so that you couldn't have people
[21:08.000 --> 21:11.840]  sitting behind their staff and like looking over their shoulders i never got to the bottom of
[21:11.840 --> 21:16.800]  whether that rumor was true or not and forgive me for like flaming it but but it is interesting to
[21:16.800 --> 21:22.480]  think about like the fact that they could reserve extra seats just to protect the secrecy of of
[21:22.480 --> 21:27.600]  work as as people might be traveling to and from china i'm endlessly fascinated by stories like
[21:27.600 --> 21:37.360]  that though because apple so neatly wraps up their presentations and introductions right that there's
[21:37.360 --> 21:46.000]  this complete and utter facade of you don't need to worry how we made this here's the thing and it
[21:46.000 --> 21:52.880]  is you know in the same way that the devices themselves at their best are wonderful little
[21:52.880 --> 21:59.840]  objects that that you can look at in the minutest of details and appreciate these fine things the
[21:59.840 --> 22:05.760]  the story behind them they try to present similarly right and it's like they don't really
[22:05.760 --> 22:12.240]  talk about how they do stuff and the scale of it but when you think about like 100 people a day
[22:12.240 --> 22:16.720]  flying across the pacific ocean it's and i know that they don't necessarily use those seats every
[22:16.720 --> 22:25.360]  day but it's there's a lot of people who work at apple in california who spend a lot of time
[22:26.000 --> 22:32.240]  in china and it's yeah his historically like right now we're obviously going through a strange time
[22:32.240 --> 22:38.720]  and that's not that's not as easy to pull off and and and so there's a lot of demand in china for
[22:38.720 --> 22:44.320]  for people who are bilingual and can provide provide some of the same engineering expertise
[22:44.320 --> 22:50.640]  on the ground that they once got they they want once we're able to send people over to to do a lot
[22:50.640 --> 22:55.280]  of that work so there's been some reshuffling and a bit of a shakeout as a consequence of the
[22:55.280 --> 23:02.640]  pandemic and it's when you think about it i know that you can easily do the back of the back of
[23:02.640 --> 23:05.760]  the envelope math i forget what it is but you've got it in the book where it's like how many
[23:05.760 --> 23:11.920]  iphones they sell per minute you know just all day every day around the world it's you know like
[23:11.920 --> 23:17.120]  i don't know like a couple hundred every minute or something like that yeah i can't i i don't have
[23:17.120 --> 23:21.200]  the figure right in front of me but i think the analogy i compared it to is that you know they're
[23:21.200 --> 23:27.040]  selling at this point like thousand dollar devices at the rate mcdonald's sells big macs which is just
[23:27.040 --> 23:32.240]  crazy right like a big mac costs five bucks i mean it's it's nuts that they're able to
[23:32.240 --> 23:39.840]  to move those units as fast as they do right and it's it and it it it's it's like the old adage
[23:39.840 --> 23:44.960]  i know i know i i've heard bill gates be credited with it but it's probably you know something that's
[23:44.960 --> 23:51.360]  been floating around forever but that you we we tend to underestimate how much overestimate how
[23:51.360 --> 23:57.360]  much we can do in a year but underestimate how much we can do in a decade and just reading your
[23:57.360 --> 24:02.800]  book and sort of looking back at it and and thinking about it it boggles the mind how
[24:02.800 --> 24:07.680]  different apples operations were before tim cook got there and i know that that's you know we're
[24:07.680 --> 24:13.520]  talking 20-some years at this point but they they they weren't doing anything in china they
[24:13.520 --> 24:20.800]  had factories in california they were factories in singapore they had uh it really was in hindsight
[24:20.800 --> 24:29.120]  they had uh it really was in hindsight it was a mess it was it was total mess i mean i if if
[24:29.120 --> 24:35.440]  anything that that may i mean for all the all the praise that's been lavished on jobs for coming up
[24:35.440 --> 24:41.200]  with the string of hits that he came up with in that period perhaps is his his greatest skill was
[24:41.200 --> 24:48.880]  finding you know uber talented individuals and in various specific arenas and putting them to work
[24:48.880 --> 24:54.240]  and tim cook is emblematic of that you know i i think one of my favorite stories in working on
[24:54.240 --> 24:59.600]  the book was that when jobs interviewed tim cook and he was about to leave and take this job for
[24:59.600 --> 25:06.080]  apple his boss at compact brings him in and says and says tim like i was planning on retiring in
[25:06.080 --> 25:10.240]  the next couple of years but i'll walk out the door right now if you'll just stay and take my
[25:10.240 --> 25:14.080]  job and i asked him i was like why would you do that and he goes well i'm a shareholder
[25:14.080 --> 25:20.000]  and he was the best best hire i'd ever made and i knew that if we kept him the share price would
[25:20.000 --> 25:24.720]  increase and that was better for me than staying in my job but i think that just testifies to how
[25:24.720 --> 25:31.600]  skilled he was in in that period of his life at at bringing efficiency to a supply chain and that's
[25:31.600 --> 25:36.720]  certainly what he brought into apple immediately and that's why why jobs ultimately tapped him to
[25:36.720 --> 25:44.400]  to lead apple and after stuff do you think in the in the world where tim cook wavered on that
[25:44.400 --> 25:51.760]  decision and maybe took him up and stayed at compact does his compacts fate different in that
[25:51.760 --> 26:00.560]  universe because tim cook was there like is he that good or or was that i i tend to think no
[26:00.560 --> 26:05.040]  because i don't see he could have helped them operationally but i don't see how tim cook's
[26:05.040 --> 26:10.320]  presence leading compact would have saved them from the fate of the ultimate fate they have
[26:10.320 --> 26:16.240]  which is sort of irrelevant well yeah and the stagnation of the of the pc market right i mean
[26:16.240 --> 26:21.680]  if you think about it what what was what was the pc markets i'm doing in many ways was what
[26:22.720 --> 26:28.880]  was the revival at apple itself from from the imac all the way to the macbook air and the way those
[26:28.880 --> 26:34.640]  those two products in particular in the computer world changed changed people's perception of what
[26:34.640 --> 26:40.640]  uh what a computer should be you know one you know in the imac so that a computer could actually be
[26:40.640 --> 26:46.320]  kind of fun to have and then the other later showed that you didn't have to lug a you know
[26:46.960 --> 26:52.400]  i don't know a cinder block around on your shoulder every single day yeah i remember the
[26:52.400 --> 26:57.680]  were you there for the keynote where where they introduced the air and jobs pulled it out of the
[26:57.680 --> 27:04.720]  manila envelope no i was i was actually writing about the olympics and that that day and age it
[27:04.720 --> 27:12.160]  was that was a different lifetime for me it was it just it's just a pinnacle of showmanship and
[27:12.160 --> 27:17.040]  it's like in hindsight it's like well so but big deal all the everybody's laptop today could fit
[27:17.040 --> 27:24.960]  in a sufficiently large inner office mail uh manila envelope but at the time it seemed ridiculous
[27:24.960 --> 27:30.960]  right it was like laptops are not this thin and i guess the other thing that sticks out about that
[27:30.960 --> 27:36.560]  sighting if you want to cite the imac and the macbook air which i think is is a good one-two
[27:36.560 --> 27:44.080]  punch of the the evolution of apple's design to me there's a big difference between the two which
[27:44.080 --> 27:54.560]  is that the imac ultimately was very trendy and that translucent candy colored plastic look it
[27:54.560 --> 27:59.120]  obviously became a sensation i remember like going to target and you'd you know there'd be like an
[27:59.120 --> 28:07.120]  11 alarm clock and it was made out of clear blue plastic why yeah why like everything you could
[28:07.120 --> 28:11.680]  make you could buy like a coffee maker and it was made out of clear blue or pink plastic or
[28:11.680 --> 28:17.840]  something like that and it was like there's nothing inside this device that is good to look at you
[28:17.840 --> 28:22.240]  know like part of the appeal of the imac was that it was supposed you know the internals were were
[28:22.240 --> 28:28.800]  worth showing off right but it was ultimately trend trendy and you know i think that's what
[28:28.800 --> 28:34.160]  the doctor ordered for apple famously it's not like your book is you know making an original
[28:34.160 --> 28:40.640]  point that the imac marked a turning point of of apple you know having you know having a hit
[28:40.640 --> 28:46.560]  product that they'd sorely needed but it wasn't that long until the macbook air when did the first
[28:46.560 --> 28:54.880]  macbook air come out was it what circuit 2007 yes am i crazy that sounds about right you know so
[28:54.880 --> 29:01.120]  about a decade a little bit less than a decade but with with the i'm with the the macbook air
[29:01.120 --> 29:07.760]  they kind of hit with that that aluminum which you go into in in the book about the the tooling
[29:07.760 --> 29:14.480]  that they had to invest in to get these these one piece aluminum cases it was i'm not going to say
[29:14.480 --> 29:19.360]  it's forever i'm not saying that 20 more years from now we'll still have computers that are made
[29:19.360 --> 29:24.240]  out of aluminum that look like that i mean you know everything changes in the computer world but
[29:24.240 --> 29:30.560]  it's much more of a timeless design that that is sort of the opposite of trendy it's it's like
[29:30.560 --> 29:38.000]  a classic rolex watch or something where or a Porsche you know Porsche 911 where okay you know
[29:38.000 --> 29:42.720]  the cars evolve constantly and they're way different than they were 30 years ago but you
[29:42.720 --> 29:50.880]  can just see there's a sort of just a visual dna oh yeah that's a Porsche 911 i mean to this day i
[29:50.880 --> 29:56.640]  mean that's still the signature look of of the macbook product line whether you have a pro or
[29:56.640 --> 30:01.840]  an air right that's it's still on that legacy foundation that was introduced back well and
[30:01.840 --> 30:06.400]  the other thing is you know and again not not accusing anybody of copying per se but it's so
[30:06.400 --> 30:10.960]  pervasive that it's sort of the default look for all laptops and i know you know there are certain
[30:10.960 --> 30:15.120]  brands like thinkpad that have a very distinctive look that's very different you know with their
[30:15.120 --> 30:22.480]  black plastic type look but for the most part like if you're watching tv and the the the people
[30:22.480 --> 30:26.800]  on tv have a laptop in front of them like the sports people in the booth or whatever it doesn't
[30:26.800 --> 30:32.720]  matter what brand it is if it's an apple or not it probably looks like a macbook air yeah absolutely
[30:32.720 --> 30:38.240]  to get back to what like compacts or hps look like that a lot right now right am i am i crazy no no
[30:38.240 --> 30:43.120]  they all do without that kind of like silver silver finish and and everything else so yeah
[30:44.240 --> 30:54.000]  i i always thought that that was something that johnny i've was moving to from the get-go like i
[30:55.280 --> 31:01.840]  it's not like he ever told me this i don't think he would but it it seems to me though and
[31:01.840 --> 31:09.760]  and listening to johnny's public remarks and talking in the way he talks about products
[31:09.760 --> 31:15.520]  it seems to me and and you know seeing what he seems to want to be doing at love from which we
[31:15.520 --> 31:20.240]  really haven't seen much come out of that yet so we don't you know who's to say where that's
[31:20.240 --> 31:23.680]  going i guess maybe we can we can touch back on this towards the end of the interview and
[31:23.680 --> 31:28.560]  see what you think but it seems to me like he's interested in building things that are not
[31:28.560 --> 31:35.440]  transient in terms of their relevance you know and that's why he's he does things like design chairs
[31:35.440 --> 31:43.280]  right every designer seems to at some point design a chair yeah yeah i know i think he's
[31:43.280 --> 31:50.480]  he's looking to to reach beyond kind of the confines of the world that he was he was resigned
[31:50.480 --> 31:55.200]  to live with him for such a long time right i think that's acquired a little bit of the
[31:55.200 --> 32:00.000]  a little bit of the restlessness that he was dealing with in his latter years at apple was
[32:00.000 --> 32:06.640]  was working with before the same form factors he'd been working with for a long time and and having
[32:06.640 --> 32:10.560]  a desire to move on to something else and that's probably part of the reason he poured a ton of
[32:10.560 --> 32:16.400]  time into i like a camera and it's part of the reason right now i love from him i'm sure he's
[32:17.440 --> 32:24.000]  invigorated by working with ferrari and working on leather goods and and anything that they're
[32:24.000 --> 32:28.480]  doing on the auto front i'm not clear on what they're doing on the auto front but i know he's
[32:28.480 --> 32:35.600]  gonna be able to have some influence over that yeah and you know and his pal mark newson designed
[32:35.600 --> 32:43.200]  a car quite a while ago which is sort of a fascinating design and it kind of looks appley
[32:43.200 --> 32:50.560]  you can kind of see how johnny i've and mark newson are of a like mind you could see why
[32:50.560 --> 32:56.080]  they're such close friends and collaborators but it's you know and and that's obviously
[32:56.080 --> 33:00.480]  i mean how much of that do you think you got into in the book with project titan at apple
[33:02.320 --> 33:07.120]  probably not enough to satisfy your your listeners but because because much of what
[33:07.760 --> 33:14.480]  i focused on and delving into project titan was the waywardness of the project yeah and the the
[33:14.480 --> 33:21.040]  struggles and the political infighting that occurred that help explain why that project still
[33:21.040 --> 33:27.920]  you know still is still struggling to shake itself out and a lot of that is rooted in the tension
[33:27.920 --> 33:35.440]  between some of the engineering vision for it led by dan ricio and then johnny ives own ambition to
[33:35.440 --> 33:40.560]  to really pursue full autonomy and there was a bit of a breakdown after that and and a lot of
[33:40.560 --> 33:45.920]  political infighting in this giant organization that got built up and spun up really really
[33:45.920 --> 33:50.960]  quickly by apple standards with a lot of external people and that that was that was a difficult
[33:50.960 --> 33:56.640]  thing for for the company to deal with i think it still is i i mean because it still is an ongoing
[33:56.640 --> 34:03.680]  concern it still is an ongoing division as tim cook says autonomy is an area of interest i think
[34:03.680 --> 34:10.560]  i think something to that effect right uh yeah i still one of the most interesting things tim
[34:10.560 --> 34:14.560]  cook has ever said publicly was at one point before the watch came out and somebody asked
[34:14.560 --> 34:17.760]  like hey there's rumors you guys are making a watch what do you think of that and he goes the
[34:17.760 --> 34:24.560]  wrist is an area of interest and it was like that's like you kind of gave it up there like
[34:24.560 --> 34:29.520]  which is on apple like but it wasn't like he said it offhandedly he was very deliberate about it
[34:29.520 --> 34:35.120]  but it's sort of like in the way that whenever there's a new area that they're going into there
[34:35.120 --> 34:40.000]  they can be a little bit freer to talk or hint about it because they're not spoiling their own
[34:40.000 --> 34:46.000]  sales with the famous osborne effect right like if if they've got like a brand new revolutionary
[34:46.000 --> 34:52.080]  ipad in the works they're not going to talk about it until it's ready to ship so as not to decrease
[34:52.080 --> 34:57.600]  interest in the ipads that are currently on the market or the iphone or whatever product but when
[34:57.600 --> 35:01.920]  they don't sell anything for the wrist he could say something intriguing like that and go on
[35:01.920 --> 35:08.720]  the car thing is such a fascinating story though because it's so secretive but we know there's so
[35:08.720 --> 35:15.600]  much turnover right like one of the things that that can't really be held completely secret is
[35:15.600 --> 35:21.120]  when you know thanks to like linkedin and and just it's human nature right like just because you
[35:21.120 --> 35:26.160]  worked at apple doesn't you know there is a code of omerta but you if you leave and go to another
[35:26.160 --> 35:32.400]  company people find out right and there's been so much turnover within the titan division at the
[35:32.400 --> 35:39.360]  executive level that it's and unlike any other division at apple that i'm aware of i've never
[35:39.360 --> 35:46.000]  heard of anything like that no no and it it because you haven't seen the influence of
[35:46.000 --> 35:51.360]  external hiring either for many other projects and for people at apple that was a real struggle was
[35:51.360 --> 35:58.320]  all of a sudden you had a division that was a thousand people strong many of whom were not from
[35:58.320 --> 36:04.960]  the apple culture and so there was this internal friction between people who had who had grown up
[36:04.960 --> 36:12.800]  at apple and understood how apple pursued product product development and kind of defied or sought
[36:12.800 --> 36:20.000]  to defy like the basic understanding of like what people thought a product in that arena should be
[36:20.000 --> 36:25.040]  and those who had been working in autonomy for a long time and knew the problems and said yeah
[36:25.040 --> 36:31.120]  but you you can't just say we'll fix this or we'll get around this like this has existed and that was
[36:31.120 --> 36:38.000]  that was a constant push and pull between those two forces i mean i guess fundamentally the the
[36:38.000 --> 36:45.200]  overarching story and and the overarching doubts continuing even today as the company is you know
[36:45.200 --> 36:50.240]  it's super successful the most profitable company in the world there there seemed to be firing on
[36:50.240 --> 36:57.840]  all cylinders with their existing product line but the what's the next big thing right and the
[36:58.640 --> 37:05.200]  when when jobs died the argument was i you know he was the one who drove them to make
[37:05.200 --> 37:11.440]  these new things at this incredible pace with this incredible panache and to debut
[37:11.440 --> 37:16.000]  with something like the iphone that just blows people away and then just a few years later
[37:16.000 --> 37:22.160]  to turn the iphone technology into the ipad and which has obviously gone on to be an enormous
[37:22.160 --> 37:27.680]  hit and a huge part of people's daily lives can they do it you know can they keep doing that
[37:27.680 --> 37:34.880]  without them and i part of my writing has been to sort of remind people that even when steve jobs
[37:34.880 --> 37:40.720]  was alive and well and firing on all cylinders apple didn't come out with new products very often
[37:40.720 --> 37:46.800]  very often it's it is still it was always a rare thing right like what what did they have in the
[37:46.800 --> 37:56.320]  jobs 2.0 era at apple after they they reunified with next the imac the imac ipod iphone and ipod
[37:56.320 --> 38:00.800]  would be the four i would play too and i would point to those largely because of their their
[38:00.800 --> 38:05.280]  cultural significance right i mean when you talked about like the way the imac was such a cultural
[38:05.280 --> 38:11.280]  sensation that there were there were alarm clocks designed like that you know with the ipod it
[38:11.280 --> 38:15.760]  really changed the way people listen to music iphone obviously is indispensable to everyone's
[38:15.760 --> 38:22.400]  life to this day and then the ipad is is become an extension of the of the iphone and and and
[38:23.280 --> 38:27.360]  and is how many people begin their days and in their days whether it's reading a magazine or a
[38:27.360 --> 38:33.120]  newspaper in the morning or you know watching watching a movie in bed at night yeah and you
[38:33.120 --> 38:38.640]  know i would throw from my perspective i would throw mac os 10 the operating system in there
[38:38.640 --> 38:44.400]  but i also get it though that from most people they don't really you know people go into the
[38:44.400 --> 38:50.080]  apple store not to buy a mac os 10 machine they go in to buy a macbook right that's what it's
[38:50.080 --> 38:57.200]  the overall product and i think apple has always gotten that so in in the years since jobs died
[38:57.200 --> 39:06.960]  there's apple watch right that's that's the one big loot yeah and then and really i would i don't
[39:06.960 --> 39:12.080]  know i would broaden that and say the wearables category because with it when they were when they
[39:12.080 --> 39:16.160]  were thinking about the apple watch and the book goes into this in some detail they they
[39:16.160 --> 39:21.760]  their aspirations were for it to liberate you from your phone and as they were thinking about
[39:21.760 --> 39:26.240]  well if it's going to liberate you from your phone what else do you need that was when they
[39:26.240 --> 39:30.240]  that was when they began their conversation earliest conversations about having bluetooth
[39:30.240 --> 39:34.880]  headsets so air pods are really an extension of apple watch i mean they're they're kind of
[39:34.880 --> 39:40.720]  interconnected so that is yeah and and when you look at what they've done over the past decade
[39:40.720 --> 39:46.960]  that is the new product category that they they've embarked on yeah i yeah air pods is i i have to
[39:46.960 --> 39:52.320]  remind myself that it should count as a as a major launch because i do think i think it's changed
[39:52.320 --> 39:59.280]  you know it's it you see them everywhere right i mean you can and it is funny like you go into it
[39:59.280 --> 40:07.120]  in the book too talking about the original ipod from 2001 and that there was pressure within apple
[40:07.120 --> 40:11.920]  have black headphones because that was sort of the you know if you're only going to conclude one set
[40:11.920 --> 40:20.000]  of earbuds with with a mobile music player sony was sort of the state of the art and the sony look
[40:20.000 --> 40:25.920]  was black and johnny i've and his team pushed for no we're going to do this thing it's going to be
[40:25.920 --> 40:32.240]  white it's going to be a white device and we're going to have white headphones and then right and
[40:32.240 --> 40:37.280]  then that becomes you know significant obviously when they develop the silhouette i mean that
[40:37.280 --> 40:42.240]  becomes like part of the reason that became that product became such a cultural sensation
[40:42.240 --> 40:48.320]  yeah yep and that was a long-running ad campaign too and i just i always think of it i because it
[40:48.320 --> 40:54.640]  was print it was tv it worked just as well like at a billboard in a subway station as it did
[40:54.640 --> 41:01.040]  in a 30-second spot during you know a football game or or something like that but it really was
[41:01.040 --> 41:06.000]  distinctive where you had these bright primary colors for the background a black silhouette of
[41:06.000 --> 41:11.280]  a person and then these iconic white headphones you know with the cable but it's funny thinking
[41:11.280 --> 41:16.960]  about how air pods to me have been so normalized like when i see a show now but we were just what
[41:16.960 --> 41:22.080]  i don't know if you watched the ozark on netflix my wife and i are addicted number it's coming to
[41:22.080 --> 41:28.800]  a close but there's a one of the main characters was listening to music for a whole episode and
[41:28.800 --> 41:34.640]  she was like on like a long road trip and but she's using wired earbuds with her iphone and
[41:34.640 --> 41:40.960]  i'm like that's that does not seem like 2022 get that get that woman some air pods right right
[41:40.960 --> 41:46.160]  it's funny because apple's been dean for like having too much air pod exposure and the morning
[41:46.160 --> 41:51.680]  show and some of their other programming right but it but in a way they're they're a better
[41:51.680 --> 41:57.120]  reflection of reality than then say like ozarks are where you've got this wired hudson because
[41:57.120 --> 42:01.360]  that you just don't see that that often if you're commuting anywhere in any kind of major
[42:01.360 --> 42:05.920]  metropolitan city right or especially for a younger character you know what i mean like you
[42:05.920 --> 42:12.000]  know maybe the older you are the the less likely you are to jump on the newest thing but i don't
[42:12.000 --> 42:17.680]  know you just don't see them too much in the city anymore i mean wired headphones it's it's pretty
[42:17.680 --> 42:24.240]  pretty interesting um the watch is something though that you get into uh at great length
[42:24.240 --> 42:28.960]  you had an excerpt from the book that ran in the new york times last weekend i believe over the
[42:28.960 --> 42:37.120]  weekend talking about that so let's get into to that aspect and i do you think is it fair for me
[42:37.120 --> 42:45.920]  to say that that your take is that there was some fundamental tension as to what the what
[42:45.920 --> 42:52.960]  the purpose of the watch was and that johnny i've in your view saw it primarily as a fashion item
[42:52.960 --> 42:58.720]  that's probably overstating things slightly i mean johnny johnny johnny was also involved in some of
[42:58.720 --> 43:05.040]  the and in some of the i guess human interface aspects of of the fitness rings and everything
[43:05.040 --> 43:09.920]  else so it'd be short-changing him to say that he's solely sold as a fashion item but when he
[43:09.920 --> 43:16.800]  came to marketing the product that was where his his emphasis and priority was in part because
[43:16.800 --> 43:23.760]  he really believed that if it was if the product was rejected by society's tastemakers by the
[43:23.760 --> 43:28.560]  fashion world that it would never be accepted by anyone and it was interesting to come into into
[43:28.560 --> 43:33.440]  the whole thing because and into the reporting process because i was inclined to believe that
[43:33.440 --> 43:39.760]  that was foolhardy and and you know mistaken emphasis on his part and i came out the other
[43:39.760 --> 43:45.760]  side after talking with a lot of people both from the world of fashion and from the world of apple
[43:45.760 --> 43:52.480]  people who were sympathetic to to johnny's vision for for leading with or putting an emphasis on
[43:52.480 --> 43:59.520]  fashion in the marketing and i left persuaded that that actually was probably the right instinct
[43:59.520 --> 44:06.880]  and maybe the the fault in all of it was leaning too far into that and and and i don't know if
[44:06.880 --> 44:12.960]  leaning too far into that was a consequence of maybe the of the watch not being functionally
[44:12.960 --> 44:18.320]  sophisticated enough to put the emphasis elsewhere yet i mean if you remember here was a time piece
[44:18.320 --> 44:23.360]  that didn't tell time half the time right that's a lot of times in one sentence but you know what
[44:23.360 --> 44:27.760]  i'm saying like you had to flick it towards your face in order to see what time it was because the
[44:27.760 --> 44:32.640]  battery power was so so insufficient that they really needed to manage that but with the fashion
[44:32.640 --> 44:39.120]  thing the reason i came around to just believing that johnny had some point in emphasizing it is
[44:39.120 --> 44:44.800]  this scene that a lot of people directed me to and devil wears prada which i had watched but not
[44:44.800 --> 44:50.720]  paid that close of attention to where ann hathaway's character gets upbraided by the anna winter
[44:50.720 --> 44:58.720]  character and she's she's just uh savage because she has on a blue sweater and she's dismissive
[44:58.720 --> 45:04.640]  of fashion and she's told well look that's cerulean blue if you knew anything about fashion
[45:04.640 --> 45:09.520]  you would know the only reason that that's being sold at the gap or wherever she had bought it
[45:09.520 --> 45:14.880]  was because it was introduced on runways two years earlier and that set the tone that this was a
[45:14.880 --> 45:20.800]  going to be the it color for the foreseeable future and that's that's something that a lot
[45:20.800 --> 45:26.000]  of people that apple pointed to and just said like this is why we needed to put the emphasis there
[45:26.000 --> 45:29.920]  because otherwise people would say you know in the fashion world might have dismissed this as
[45:29.920 --> 45:35.120]  a computer on the wrist and it would have never taken flight so i i'm sympathetic to that view
[45:35.120 --> 45:40.160]  i think there's there's validity to it i love that scene from that movie i've i think i've seen it on
[45:40.160 --> 45:45.040]  i know i've seen the movie but i've seen that scene pulled out on youtube a few times and it's
[45:45.040 --> 45:51.600]  it it's it makes you think it makes you realize that it's there's more to it like that's obviously
[45:51.600 --> 45:58.160]  uh the anna winter streep's character's point is that this is not as superficial as you think
[45:58.160 --> 46:02.640]  there's there is a real thing here and there's an expertise she gets into like the being an ex
[46:02.640 --> 46:07.760]  you know the expertise it takes to reproduce a color exactly and and to to weave a certain
[46:07.760 --> 46:14.080]  fabric a certain way one of the things i think you get into in the book was is is the idea of
[46:14.080 --> 46:20.240]  was the watch ready to launch when they launched it and that it seems and i think you just touched
[46:20.240 --> 46:27.200]  on this a little bit with with talking about why did johnny i've want to lean into the fashion side
[46:27.200 --> 46:36.320]  of it and how it looks was out of a concern that how it worked wasn't good enough yet right yeah
[46:36.320 --> 46:40.800]  yeah i mean there's a scene in the book that's pretty telling where one of the the central
[46:40.800 --> 46:46.240]  engineers who was who was the lead engineer on the project pulls jeff williams aside
[46:47.520 --> 46:52.160]  just on the cusp of them pushing to try to get this thing out the door and announce it and says
[46:52.960 --> 46:57.600]  hey jeff you know let me ask you a question if you came to work today and you forgot your iphone
[46:57.600 --> 47:02.880]  what would you do and jeff said well i'd turn around and go get it because i need it all day
[47:02.880 --> 47:08.160]  and he said well if you forgot your watch what would you do and jeff cop to the thing that he
[47:08.160 --> 47:12.880]  would he would go and get it he would go and get it at the end of the day you know and the engineer
[47:12.880 --> 47:17.120]  looks at him and says well that's that's the point this this product's not ready people don't need it
[47:17.120 --> 47:24.960]  yet and for people who had been raised in in the jobs world that was a fundamental aspect of of
[47:24.960 --> 47:30.800]  what they needed to to do was create a product that people immediately recognized there was some
[47:30.800 --> 47:36.560]  need for and there's a real sense among some people inside apple that that this product was
[47:36.560 --> 47:43.040]  not there yeah i i think in hindsight that's true i i believe that i've mentioned that i i think it
[47:43.040 --> 47:49.040]  needed another year but because and i really do think that the the as they called it the series
[47:49.040 --> 47:54.240]  two even though they never called the original the series one because then it sort of complicated
[47:54.240 --> 48:00.640]  where they came out with a series one that was like an upgraded version of the series zero for
[48:00.640 --> 48:07.360]  lack of a better a better term for the original but i also understand it was a time of inordinate
[48:08.000 --> 48:15.440]  unprecedented stress within the company because of the timeline of steve jobs is passing
[48:15.440 --> 48:25.760]  it i i think coincidental to that was the the sort of two third 2013 era samsung is taking over
[48:25.760 --> 48:33.200]  this market and it samsung is on the upswing apple apple can't do it just like we all predicted apple
[48:33.200 --> 48:39.360]  can't do it without steve jobs samsung is the one who's innovating you know that's that's the the
[48:39.360 --> 48:48.240]  famous ad lib by phil shiller at wwdc introducing the the mac pro can't innovate my ass right right
[48:48.240 --> 48:53.200]  and then yeah that just spoke to the the unrelenting pressure externally and the deep
[48:53.200 --> 48:58.800]  skepticism that everyone at apple face that they could they could do it without steve jobs right
[48:58.800 --> 49:05.440]  which has got to be got to be exhausting right because one of the things that i hope that people
[49:05.440 --> 49:10.400]  get out of this book is that these are people who who had a deep connection with steve they
[49:10.400 --> 49:14.560]  worked with them every day you know we all know that steve jobs could be an asshole but these
[49:14.560 --> 49:18.880]  people loved working for him and that was why they woke up in the morning and so there was
[49:19.440 --> 49:24.640]  there was just real profound grief in the wake of his death and i i just don't think that that's
[49:24.640 --> 49:30.480]  something that we think enough about as we think about a company is like the individuals and some
[49:30.480 --> 49:36.240]  of the some of the just basic you know hardship that they went to as human beings in the aftermath
[49:36.240 --> 49:43.680]  of that yeah and i just think you know if they erred on the side of pushing the apple watch out
[49:43.680 --> 49:50.720]  one year maybe before they should have i think it's understandable and maybe maybe it still was
[49:50.720 --> 49:55.920]  the right decision to do overall i mean and you know in the success the watch has had since then
[49:55.920 --> 50:01.760]  would would sort of you know back that up to some degree but that it in the same way that like when
[50:01.760 --> 50:07.200]  when jobs first came back to the company and they did the think secret ad campaign or think different
[50:07.200 --> 50:15.040]  ad ad campaign which wasn't about pushing products but was just a pure brand message right was yeah
[50:15.040 --> 50:20.000]  it's about redefining the company's image publicly right right so they're not perceived as a beleaguered
[50:20.000 --> 50:26.160]  a beleaguered company on the brink of bankruptcy anymore right or or maybe even certainly
[50:26.160 --> 50:32.160]  redefining the the the then current narrative around the company but not really redefining but
[50:32.160 --> 50:38.320]  reasserting what it really was you know right like the idea wasn't that this is the new apple this is
[50:39.040 --> 50:45.840]  a fixed apple from from the hiccups of recent years but we're we're we're clarified in our
[50:45.840 --> 50:52.240]  thinking of what it is we're here to do and this is the way we should think about it and in some
[50:52.240 --> 50:59.920]  sense if if they pushed if tim cook pushed to get and jeff williams to to launch apple watch
[50:59.920 --> 51:06.400]  let's just say one year before they should have technically maybe it was worth it to assert that
[51:06.400 --> 51:13.440]  they can still launch a major new product when when they did and that for morale and for you know
[51:13.440 --> 51:19.360]  the the the the what the what the outside world thinks of apple is they can still launch new
[51:19.360 --> 51:25.680]  things but right it certainly relieved and alleviated a lot of pressure externally but
[51:25.680 --> 51:32.560]  by the same token once it was released when it didn't measure up to internal and external
[51:32.560 --> 51:40.960]  expectations in terms of sales then then they also took it on the chin for that as well which is
[51:40.960 --> 51:46.000]  which is unfortunate because to your point with persistence that product has improved its
[51:46.000 --> 51:51.600]  capabilities and its functionalities and you don't see it as often as you see airpods when you're
[51:51.600 --> 51:56.480]  commuting to work but you see it a lot if you're if you next time you sit down at a restaurant look
[51:56.480 --> 52:01.600]  around and see how many people have on a on an apple watch it's it's it's got to be at least a
[52:01.600 --> 52:06.480]  third of the restaurant if not more i mean that's that's pretty deep reach for for a product like
[52:06.480 --> 52:12.080]  that yeah and i think that they did one of the knocks against the whole idea was the idea that
[52:12.080 --> 52:16.960]  people don't wear watches anymore especially you know the younger people are the less likely they
[52:16.960 --> 52:23.360]  are to wear a watch that watch wearing was was at an all-time low especially for you know people in
[52:23.360 --> 52:28.720]  their 20s at the time or even younger like teenagers and you know the response is why
[52:28.720 --> 52:32.240]  would i want to wear a watch i have a phone in my pocket it tells me the time it's almost like the
[52:32.240 --> 52:36.960]  world you know like for time telling the whole world went back 100 years to pocket watches
[52:37.840 --> 52:42.880]  but and i get it i'm i'm always been a watch where i've worn a wristwatch since i was a teenager
[52:42.880 --> 52:48.640]  it's i feel naked without a watch on my left wrist uh but you know i realized that that's
[52:48.640 --> 52:54.800]  a habit and i totally get the idea of why have another thing to charge why have another thing
[52:54.800 --> 52:58.480]  to worry about if i want to know what time it is i just take my phone out and i'm taking my
[52:58.480 --> 53:04.400]  phone in and out of my pocket a thousand times a day anyway right and i tried yeah but i they
[53:04.400 --> 53:10.400]  almost had to like recondition the world to accept that like watches have value yeah yeah and that
[53:10.400 --> 53:17.920]  you might want to have one like i think that's part of the ubiquity of seeing apple watches on
[53:17.920 --> 53:23.120]  men's and women's wrists everywhere you go every restaurant you go to or you go to an airport or
[53:23.120 --> 53:26.640]  something like that and if you do look for people wearing apple watch you're going to see a lot of
[53:26.640 --> 53:31.920]  them and i think it's a lot of people who weren't wearing a watch previously yes sure there's
[53:31.920 --> 53:38.640]  definitely people who who did and have switched to an apple watch but i i think that to be a success
[53:38.640 --> 53:44.720]  they kind of had to reinvigorate the idea that you might even want to wear a watch right which
[53:44.720 --> 53:50.640]  gets you back to fashion right because that's because that's the the industry that had the
[53:50.640 --> 53:56.400]  deepest connection to timepieces up and up until that point i mean what else could you have leaned
[53:56.400 --> 54:02.880]  on in order to to kind of bridge that gap and sell this product into into a world that had
[54:02.880 --> 54:09.280]  largely abandoned wearing timepieces and you know there is technology in traditional watches i just
[54:09.280 --> 54:14.320]  acted by coincidence linked to a thing the other day on daring fireball some somebody had just a
[54:14.320 --> 54:20.640]  wonderful wonderful online almost like a little mini book but animated explaining how a mechanical
[54:20.640 --> 54:26.560]  watch works with all these little animations it's just absolutely fascinating and you know it's
[54:26.560 --> 54:33.680]  technology right like having a a rolex submariner that can go 300 meters under the surface of water
[54:33.680 --> 54:39.680]  and still remain airtight that's technology you know i mean i'm how many people who actually buy
[54:39.680 --> 54:48.560]  a rolex go 100 meters deep in the ocean i mean probably 0.001 and you know the one is james
[54:48.560 --> 54:54.720]  cameron you know it's it's not something people typically do but the technology is there and
[54:54.720 --> 55:00.400]  people you know it is a technology product but it primarily it's you know they're sold as fashion
[55:00.400 --> 55:04.480]  they're jewelry right you go when you want to buy a rolex you go to a jeweler you don't go to
[55:05.600 --> 55:11.680]  you know a technology store all right let me right and and oh yeah so we can pick up when you come
[55:11.680 --> 55:15.680]  back but i have some thought i have some thoughts on that because i i think one of the interesting
[55:15.680 --> 55:21.680]  things was delving into the the history of time and time pieces because it provided both a lens
[55:21.680 --> 55:28.000]  into the deep thought that goes on inside apple as they pursue a product but then also this
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.960]  this kind of weird i have this weird thing about empires and time that i'd love to talk to you a
[55:32.960 --> 55:36.160]  little bit about as well all right put your finger on that let's come back to it after a moment i'm
[55:36.160 --> 55:42.160]  going to tell you about our next sponsor it's our good friends at collide k-o-l-i-d-e collide is a
[55:42.160 --> 55:50.400]  new take on endpoint management that asks how can we get end users more involved this is in contrast
[55:50.400 --> 55:56.320]  to old school device management tools like mdm which lock down your employees devices without
[55:56.320 --> 56:01.280]  considering their needs or even looking at it from their perspective as a user and it definitely
[56:01.280 --> 56:05.920]  doesn't attempt to educate them about the actual security issues around their laptop and what
[56:05.920 --> 56:16.320]  happens mdm is so disruptive and so so own onerous to users that what they often do is that they just
[56:16.320 --> 56:21.840]  they'll just throw up their hands and and switch to using their personal laptops without telling
[56:21.840 --> 56:26.560]  anyone so you give them a work laptop you lock it down and what do they do they wind up using their
[56:26.560 --> 56:31.280]  personal laptop and then there's no security on it whatsoever in that scenario everyone loses
[56:31.280 --> 56:36.160]  collide is different instead of locking down a device collide takes a user-focused approach
[56:36.160 --> 56:42.080]  that communicates security recommendations to your employees directly on slack so it's using slack
[56:42.080 --> 56:46.880]  the thing your company's already using to communicate you're not asking them to open up
[56:46.880 --> 56:52.160]  a new source of notifications they just interact with collide right through slack it's something
[56:52.160 --> 56:57.600]  they're already using on a daily basis and it gives them information not just what to do but
[56:57.600 --> 57:05.200]  why so that they understand and become active users in increasing the security of the information
[57:05.200 --> 57:14.080]  from work that's on their laptops and it educates users while not getting in the way that's collide
[57:14.080 --> 57:20.960]  cross-platform endpoint management for linux mac and windows devices and it puts end users first
[57:20.960 --> 57:27.840]  for teams that slack get endpoint management that puts them first visit collide kolide.com slash

[57:39.920 --> 57:47.200]  required give them a try at collide.com slash the talk show all right you were talking about time
[57:47.200 --> 57:52.880]  right right i think one of the the more interesting days that i spent while i was reporting
[57:52.880 --> 57:58.720]  on this was when i went to the greenwich observatory in london because because i was
[57:58.720 --> 58:04.000]  trying to walk in the footsteps of the designers as they were trying to learn more about history
[58:04.000 --> 58:08.560]  and history of time keeping and everything else and i met with this guy who's got a great book
[58:08.560 --> 58:15.280]  called about time his his name's david runey's he's he's studying the history of time for
[58:15.280 --> 58:22.880]  you know most of his life and he was talking to me about how central developing the mechanism to tell
[58:22.880 --> 58:29.120]  time accurately was to the to the construction of the british empire and it was just like an
[58:29.120 --> 58:33.600]  interesting thing so like all the all the ships would come into the greenwich observatory they'd
[58:33.600 --> 58:39.200]  get the the timepieces that they had on the boat tuned and dialed correctly and then that allowed
[58:39.200 --> 58:43.760]  them to navigate the world and build out the british empire and for me what was interesting
[58:43.760 --> 58:50.720]  about this is apple was embarking on this journey to create its own timepiece and at the same time
[58:50.720 --> 58:55.920]  it was building an empire of its own if you think about it it's it's really become a borderless
[58:55.920 --> 59:00.400]  country and i just i don't know it was just something that was like an interesting and
[59:00.400 --> 59:07.840]  slightly uh unique spin on history like that like corporate history was aping you know real history
[59:07.840 --> 59:15.280]  from years earlier at some point technology as generation as humans gener you know whatever
[59:15.280 --> 59:21.120]  whatever was invented before you were born doesn't seem like technology anymore right like i i often
[59:21.120 --> 59:26.000]  think about that like if you could time travel and bring say ben franklin to the present day and show
[59:26.000 --> 59:30.480]  him around and it's like you might think he might be wouldn't you love to show him the iphone and
[59:30.480 --> 59:35.760]  it's like i always think like wouldn't he be most impressed by like indoor toilets like you could
[59:35.760 --> 59:42.400]  just probably true yeah right that probably would be the yeah the thing that he'd be like wait i
[59:42.400 --> 59:47.760]  don't have to go outside anymore that's fantastic you just go right in there and you hit a button
[59:47.760 --> 59:52.000]  and then it just goes where does it go where's where's the waste go and it's like you just say
[59:52.000 --> 59:58.640]  it just goes out into the city there's special pipes it it goes to a facility and it's you know
[59:58.640 --> 01:00:03.200]  wouldn't that be the most one of the most amazing things are they even just all of indoor plumbing
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:08.240]  right you just have a sink you could just get clean cold or hot water anytime you want just by
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:14.240]  turning a dial it there you just don't think about it as technology but uh you're you're talking
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:19.440]  about the the shipbuilding history of timekeeping is i i've heard too that like the standardization
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:28.320]  in the u.s was driven by the railroad companies because it it before railroads there was really
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:34.400]  no reason to worry about whether you know like let's say you know there's a big clock on
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.560]  independence hall here in philadelphia and you know if you want to say that's and there's one on
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:45.840]  our city hall too and if those clocks are four minutes different than a clock in new york city
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:51.120]  well who cares right but then all of a sudden with railroads it kind of mattered right like if
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:55.920]  a train was supposed to come in at five o'clock you kind of needed it to be at the same you know
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:00.720]  to to the people in new york and philadelphia had to have their watches at the same time right
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:06.320]  yeah and and that's why uh at the outset of the watch project they were so determined to make
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:11.680]  sure that this was the most accurate timepiece that had ever been built because if if they
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:19.120]  didn't achieve that then they would be violating the legacy of of the proud tradition of of time
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:24.480]  and why it was so important to to the development of society that's it's a curious thing and
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:29.680]  that's it's a curious thing and i know even now years later people still mention that and and
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:34.160]  we're still sort of circling around this the the introduction of the original apple watch and
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:39.440]  there's the fashion angle which i still want to get back to but the one of the pillars as it was
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:47.440]  announced in september of i believe 2014 and then it shipped in like april may 2015 but in september
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:54.480]  2014 when they introduced it one of the pillars was they reiterated it this is the most accurate
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:59.440]  watch in the history of the world this is the most accurate watch the most accurate time piecing i
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:05.200]  think johnny i've himself might have narrated part of that in in his introduction video i've
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:09.520]  heard people like roll their eyes like who cares right like who's ever been worried about whether
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:14.320]  it's the most accurate watch in the world but it clearly meant a lot to apple and they don't really
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:20.640]  talk about it anymore but i see as a watch person i i get it i get why they were saying that
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:28.160]  right right because if they if they couldn't deliver on that very basic thing then they they
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:34.240]  weren't fully honoring the tradition of it and they were they were deeply aware that this was
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:39.360]  one of the the most unique products they'd ever embarked on because it was one that was familiar
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:45.120]  to everyone whereas you know if you look at the iphone yes there were mobile phones but there was
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:50.720]  nothing like what they introduced at the time and so it changed our very understanding of what a
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:59.920]  phone could be and i guess this had to bridge our understanding of what a watch was and and take us
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:04.320]  to what a watch could be and so they were very aware that they were moving into something that
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:10.000]  was pre-existing and that people came to with their with their own pre-existing notions of what
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.880]  it what it should be and what it should do one of the the fascinating things and it gets to the
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:23.040]  heart of this is it a fashion object is it a tech object is it a fitness object in the answer to all
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:27.520]  of them is yes right it's one of those trick questions where it's it's all of the above
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:33.600]  but at what mix do you think about it but one of the things that's i can't think of anything else
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:39.760]  that was like it is the way that it launched with three distinct tiers the they called it at the
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:44.800]  time the apple watch sport which was the aluminum model which is really the base model then there
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:52.720]  was just plain apple watch which was stainless steel and instead of being like 400 500 was like
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:04:00.640]  seven eight hundred dollars and then the i guess the most controversial you know angle of it was
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:06.880]  the apple watch edition which was made out of solid gold and started at ten thousand dollars
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:12.400]  and sold up to like seventeen thousand five hundred dollars or something like that yet all
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:18.480]  three like you could you know you could go in and buy a seventeen thousand dollar gold apple watch
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:23.360]  and i could go in and buy a four hundred dollar or maybe it was five hundred dollar apple watch
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:29.360]  sport made out of aluminum and in terms of technology they had they were exactly the same
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:34.240]  there was no right no no battery life difference no no you know there's just slight difference in
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:40.080]  terms of the the screen being sapphire on the higher end models and thus far more scratch proof
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:45.680]  and on the the lower end models ionized glass or something they call it but it's it it's still
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:52.160]  like the same screen underneath the actual glass or sapphire right and that i've even been told
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:57.760]  that the bill of materials costs between difference between stainless steel and aluminum is
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:04.720]  is borderline negligible so the the profit that apple's re reaping on that that model alone it's
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:11.440]  dead to this day is is outstanding so yeah but but i'm also sitting here with a stainless steel
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:17.600]  watch on my wrist so so i it's you can feel the difference and some people are willing to pay up
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:24.640]  for it yeah i have the titanium one because i'm an idiot but but i do i like the way it looks i
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:29.040]  just like the way that the titanium looks and i buy one and keep it for a few years so it's worth
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:34.960]  it but this was obviously it baffled people outside the company and another weird thing about
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:40.320]  that introduction was that they didn't talk about pricing at the introduction they didn't say what
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:46.320]  any of these i think they said the starting price and that was it and but they didn't even say which
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:54.720]  model was the low end one and i remember in that interim between the announcement and you know
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:59.360]  about six months before it shipped arguing with people and trying to you know it was it's fun it
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:05.840]  was fun to be a pundit in the apple space because there was lots to lots to speculate upon right
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:12.000]  it's it's kind of fun to be in my seat when apple leaves a lot of stuff left to the imagination you
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.880]  know there's there's that's that's the job of you know the guy who writes daring fireball but there
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:23.280]  were a lot of people who thought that the sport models would cost more than apple watch because
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:28.960]  they had an adjective and they thought maybe ionized glass they were so you know was even
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:34.240]  better than sapphire and that it was meant for an active lifestyle and therefore it would cost more
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:37.520]  and i was like no you don't understand the watch world the watch world is very simple stainless
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:44.000]  steel is better than aluminum that's that's it that's more expensive but i'm curious how much
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:52.960]  how much reporting you did on on the the conflict within apple about the that that launch strategy
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:07:01.760]  of going all the all the way from 400 to 17 000 for the same product my reporting was less focused
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:10.080]  on on conflict internal or any internal conflict over pricing and it was more focused on two things
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:17.120]  that i thought were interesting you know around the watch project and one of which is you know
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:21.120]  the fact that they embarked on all those three different materials those three different
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:28.960]  materials for the cases plus the array of watch band materials that they designed made that they
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:36.240]  had to have a support team to build out all of those sport team of uh support team of engineers
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:44.960]  and operations figures and this this ability of johnny i've to keep the studio kind of i guess
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:54.000]  protected and and guarded and and really curated in terms of who had badge access to the studio and
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.360]  and this principle that was understood and these rules that were understood that had been been
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:03.840]  abided by everyone who had access over the years this idea that you don't talk about costs in the
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:10.480]  studio that that suddenly began those lines began to get blurry because you had people who were
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:15.200]  coming into the studio who who weren't indoctrinated in that and it became harder to
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:22.160]  to keep the the the group that had access and badge access as carefully curated as it had been
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:26.480]  in the past so there's there's one moment in the book where there are a couple of designers who
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:31.760]  are in a meeting with some ops and engineers guys and the ops guys are like well if we we cut the
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:37.280]  crown with with this with this system we'll say this amount of money and it's totally worth it
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:41.360]  and look you can't see the difference between the two and the designers are looking at them going
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:45.440]  no no that's that's something samsung would do that's not something apple would ever do
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:52.480]  and and it's partly an outgrowth of being so ambitious in terms of how many skews they were
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:58.480]  undertaking skews being the the different array of of and variations of the watch that they were
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:06.160]  undertaking at that time and how that created some tension and and kind of wrinkles in in a
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:12.080]  in a well-designed and well-ironed and operating system that they built yeah it's you know in
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:18.560]  compare and contrast with just the original iphone where there was one color i mean there were like
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:25.360]  i guess storage configurations right it was like 64 16 gigs and or eight gigs even i think they
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:30.720]  even had an eight gig original phone but it was like you go like 8 16 32 gigabytes but that was
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:36.800]  it your only option was you know how much storage do you want in it every box looked the same every
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:42.320]  iphone looked the same apple didn't even sell cases at the time i don't you know i don't think
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:49.040]  they foresaw the way the world actually evolved where 98 of people put their phone in a case and
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:54.160]  keep it in a case until they stopped using it it was one thing right and we we just make as many
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:10:01.440]  of this one thing as we possibly can and go versus the watch just you know not that many years later
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:09.920]  it with not quite infinite but borderline right three tiers of materials two sizes of watch 38 and
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:18.160]  42 in each in each material and whichever watch strap you want as a customer you could configure
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:23.680]  the steel watch with that strap or an aluminum watch with this other strap or buy a couple extra
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:29.360]  straps and all of it was there at the beginning it wasn't just here's the one apple watch go
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:34.880]  right right and it was it was probably the right decision right if you don't want everybody to be
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:39.920]  walking around feeling like a cyborg with the same exact thing on their wrists like you have to give
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:46.720]  them some variety and some some choice as to how they want to configure it and personalize it by
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:52.400]  the same token i don't know that in embarking on that strategy it was understood what the
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:59.440]  consequences of that would be to kind of the internal operations of the company namely the
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:05.280]  design studio which was really spearheading and driving its project one of the stories i i i
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:12.880]  i want to touch on is we we mentioned this before we started recording but a saga of the last decade
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:20.000]  at apple that isn't really in the book is the saga of the butterfly keyboards and the maybe to
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:27.440]  a lesser degree with the same macbooks the the the port story i think fame you know maybe exemplified
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:35.040]  by the no adjective 12-inch macbook that just had one port one usb-c port that was for all data and
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:42.160]  power and i'm curious why you know it's not that it's a conspicuous option it's a nice thick book
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:45.440]  full of chock-full of reporting some stuff had to be left out but i'm wondering
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:51.040]  why that didn't play a bigger role in the i mean it the honest answer is you really do have to make
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:58.080]  choices as you're as you're working on this and a lot of my choices were driven by how you know
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:05.280]  tight and close the focus was on johnny i've and tim cook and what their core concerns were during
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:12.320]  this period and in in doing that you know i certainly would be interested in doing that
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:19.520]  and in doing that you know i certainly did some reporting on on the butterfly keyboard fiasco
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:25.360]  my reporting found and and john you know this world honestly in many ways better than i ever
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:30.720]  could it found that you know some of the fault for that was was laid at the feet of some of
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:37.200]  the engineers and it didn't seem that you know that it fell at the feet of at the feet of johnny
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:43.120]  and he didn't personally drive a lot of that but more than that i mean if you're looking at and
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:49.200]  i've seen a lot of the the chatter around us and in social media if you're looking at you know the
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:54.880]  flaws that johnny might have had or the mistakes he might have made in terms of form over function
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:02.960]  i felt like that that was best revealed through his work on apple park and the experience of
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:08.000]  employees once they got into apple park so i thought that there was a way and that that
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.640]  that of course is a major threat of the book that goes from beginning to end that there was a way to
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:19.360]  touch on it through that because that was such a seminal effort for apple during this decade and
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:23.040]  when you're making these choices a lot of what you're thinking is okay what are people going
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:29.120]  to look back in 10 15 20 years from now and say like that was a that was an important moment
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:35.600]  during that period at apple and i know that the butterfly keyboard feels important to a lot of
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:41.120]  people because it it turned out because they dreaded having to plug and unplug all the dongles
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:46.560]  in and out of their computer or you know got frustrated that the keyboard didn't work the way
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:51.760]  that they wanted to but i think ultimately when people look back on it 10 15 years from now that
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:56.800]  that's that's not going to be something that they think about but that apple park is something that's
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:02.400]  going to still be big on people's radar because it's such a unique building well i think it gets
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:09.520]  to what i said earlier about johnny i've being driven to to design things that weren't transient
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:16.080]  right and what what is more permanent than a building right that's about as permanent as
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:22.320]  anything a human can help to design design and build i mean and i you know i mean i honestly i
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:30.480]  mean it sounds ridiculous but i the the it seems like a safe assumption that you know apple park
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:37.120]  is going to be there and look like that long after you and i are gone right like 70 80 years from now
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:42.720]  isn't that still going to be apple's headquarters if apple is still a concern you know yeah so long
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:48.560]  as it doesn't you know fall to fall victim to the same fate that like sun or some of these other
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:54.080]  giant companies did right before they built their giant headquarters you know it doesn't seem like
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:15:00.720]  apple's on a path to to stumble in the near future but you never know long term i almost think with
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:07.040]  a building so striking in such a incredible you know it really is a park it is it it's it's this
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:16.320]  huge thing that even if something if apple over the next 20 years falls into decline and irrelevance
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:22.320]  that it's more like the classic skyscrapers of of 100 years ago you know like the chrysler building
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:26.480]  i don't even know if the chrysler company still occupies the building but the building is still
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:32.800]  there right the the sears tower is no longer called the sears tower sears is not a retailer
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:38.400]  anymore the whole the whole chain has gone away but the but the skyscraper is still there you know
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:43.680]  like i almost feel like that's what johnny i was building a building that that might have more
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:50.320]  permanence than apple itself yeah yeah and it yeah and also in doing so it kind of became a
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:58.160]  manifestation of some of some of the physical manifestation of some of the flaws that that
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:05.120]  dogged apple over this decade right i mean it's both it's both breathtaking and stunning and i
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:09.600]  know you've walked walked the halls there and they're just things that you see and as you walk
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:14.000]  through the place that you're like this just does not exist anywhere else and it took a tremendous
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:19.680]  imagination to pull it off and then there are also there were these frustrations that occurred when
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:25.200]  people first moved in there including the fact that the you know chatter would just ricochet
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:29.520]  down the halls in such a way that they had to come in and put in cell machines to dampen the
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:35.920]  noise because that wasn't anticipated so yeah it's it is you know and there was i know i don't even
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:41.840]  know how this got resolved but i know that when it first opened it there was a lot of consternation
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:46.880]  that it was being dictated that you had to use a certain type of chair and you know it was like
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:53.520]  a johnny i've designed chair and i certainly am picky about my chairs i think most of us who have
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:59.200]  you know some sort of desk job at some point a lot of people learn to get it get a good
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:05.040]  comfortable chair and your body will thank you for it but the chair that is comfortable for you
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:10.720]  to sit in for eight ten maybe more hours a day you know obviously some people at apple during
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:15.920]  crunch periods are putting in incredibly long hours your comfortable chair is not necessarily
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:20.320]  my comfortable chair and people really really really care about it and here was this thing
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:27.040]  where they're like johnny likes these chairs so here's your chair yes yeah yeah and the doubt
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:31.920]  about it there's almost something like almost like a little howard rourke like that or frank
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:37.280]  lloyd right or something like that very insistent that the furniture goes with the architecture which
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:42.160]  is a bit impractical to your point when when you're you're there to do a job and spend your
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:48.720]  work day and you want to be as comfortable as possible do you think i mean all right let me
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:53.120]  take one last break i have one more sponsor let's do this and then we'll we'll head down the home
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:57.840]  stretch on the show but let me get this let me tell you about our good friends at memberful

[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:25.760]  big part of this post jobs era at apple is that johnny ive is no longer there right it was
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:34.160]  do you think i i'm not sure he would have lasted as long as he did if he didn't have
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:40.240]  the apple park project to to focus on and i think so i mean he tried to leave in
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:46.320]  2015 i mean he was fatigued and weary after the launch he walked into tim cook and basically said
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:51.600]  you know and i'd like to i'd like to go and and they ultimately came up with an arrangement that
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:58.800]  he would he would be there part-time and continue to work on new things so apple park and the car
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:05.760]  and augmented reality efforts things that were that were forward-looking rather than
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:13.280]  the refinements of the existing product line right and do you think i mean let's let's get
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:18.480]  let's go all the way back to the cover of the book tell me make the case for why you think
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:24.400]  apple lost its soul so the the subtitle is twofold right i mean the first part of it how apple became
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:30.880]  a multi-trillion dollar company refers to the tim cook thread of the book and then the the flip side
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:38.160]  of that is how it lost its soul jobs called johnny i have his spiritual partner they were essentially
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:44.960]  creative soulmates i've walked out the door in a way they literally lost their soul in that
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:51.520]  essence but in a metaphorical way the reason johnny left was he grew disillusioned inside
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:59.040]  this company that he loved because in the jobs era it was a place where art was was really designed
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:04.480]  to lead to commerce and increasingly in the cook era it's become a place where commerce dictates
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:11.680]  art what do you think exemplifies that i you know i think i hit on this a little bit earlier when
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:17.280]  we were talking about the watch but you start to have people coming into the design studio which
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:24.400]  people on campus called the holy of holies and and raising concerns about cost you have limitations
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:30.960]  in terms of the projects you can undertake because apple's so big you know after job stuff that they
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:36.720]  really need to only embark on and pursue products that have the potential to be at least a 10 billion
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:41.440]  dollar business right and that becomes a metric internally and that's why they explore these
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:49.760]  giant categories like health care auto and energy because they know that they've really saturated
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:55.280]  the electronics market and they need to move into something else to satisfy wall street so so those
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:59.840]  are those are the like the tensions that that that take place internally that they're dealing with
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:05.440]  somebody put this in that i mean this is not to knock apple this is this is a manifestation of
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:09.760]  the kind of growth that many silicon valley companies have been wrestling with you can you
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:15.760]  can look at google and see some of the same the same challenges there as well but as you as you
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:20.720]  get bigger and bigger it it's hard i mean it's impossible impossible to be the same nimble
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:26.160]  company you once were and and to pursue some of the things and take some of the risks that you
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:35.360]  might have done in the past it's the phone is such a fascinating product and i i you know it
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:41.680]  and i think we we touched on it earlier when we talked about the scope of the the manufacturing
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:48.400]  effort in china to to to make this many you know hundreds of millions of these things a year and
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:53.920]  it's so labor intensive right it's not like an iphone is assembled by robots yet i mean maybe
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:23:00.080]  someday but right now it's incredibly labor intensive and it's effectively these city-sized
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:08.160]  factories to to to fill these boats with enough iphones to satisfy demand it's just unbelievable
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:13.600]  it really is i i think without question the most successful consumer product in in the history of
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.920]  the world i i don't know what else you could compare it to i mean it's like you have to go
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:24.160]  back to like the east india trading company you know centuries ago to find anything that's that
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:28.880]  successful but then again you know and it's like so that's it's sort of like the ultimate goal
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:36.160]  i've always said that the iphone introduction in 2007 was the canonical ideal apple keynote
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:42.640]  right everybody went goes into before the iphone went into every keynote hoping i hope that steve
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:48.160]  jobs has the biggest surprise of all time and you know ready to ready to blow our minds with
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:53.680]  something that's been kept under wraps and will change the world and you know you can't do that
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:58.320]  every year you it you know you can't do it twice a year or three times a year or however many times
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:02.560]  they have these keynotes it doesn't work that way ideas like that don't come along very often
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:08.640]  but here's the one where the the actual keynote blew everybody away and then it turned out to be
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:16.640]  a product that people loved and changed their lives and became this true i mean just almost
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:21.600]  unfathomable juggernaut of financial success right i mean i know a lot of times people
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:26.640]  misspeak when they're talking about millions and billions or even trillions because it's like your
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:31.520]  brain files them all under like gazillions and you know it's easy to misspeak but you're you're off
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:37.200]  by a you know a factor of a thousand if you misuse millions for billions but you start looking at the
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:41.440]  money it doesn't make sense to a normal human being you know like that must clearly be part
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:48.800]  of tim cook's genius is that he he can think in terms of trillions of dollars i i can't yeah
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:53.600]  yeah we haven't we haven't spent a lot of time talking about him but that's that's his great
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:25:00.720]  gift is it is his mastery of numbers and his precision with those but that's why that's why
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:06.240]  apple's been able to go from making on the order of 20 million iphones a year around the time of
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:12.080]  job stuff to 200 million a year and that's that's a staggering increase over over the span of a
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:17.680]  decade right and you know and you start thinking about you know you start running up against the
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:23.200]  limit of how many people are on the planet who who could feasibly afford one right you're you know
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:27.360]  it's it's not quite saturated and i know they continue to grow and that you know they emphasize
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:32.800]  that in their quarterly calls and that they still have every quarter lots of new people
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:42.080]  to the iphone but it it's clearly sort of maxed out in terms of how big it could get and it and
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:50.320]  like to your point it leaves apple in a very different position than they were in pre-iphone
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:59.040]  as to what can move the needle for the company right and it's funny looking back at the the ipod
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:05.360]  era of 2001-2 and i know they kept selling them after the iphone came out but effectively in
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:11.120]  hindsight the iphone was the the end of the ipod right because everybody just plays their music and
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:18.400]  there are podcasts on their phone it it was only that's only like a seven-year period which is kind
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:25.040]  of mind-boggling because it felt like a whole era but it's like the biggest the ipod got in that era
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:30.080]  into by today's apple standards is not even that big even though we all felt it was this cultural
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:35.360]  phenomenon you know it was sort of more like you know like what airpods are today it's a nice
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:43.040]  business but it's probably about as small as it could be to actually be worth apple doing right
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:47.360]  right the interesting thing like as we talk about this and talk about the scope of the
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:53.920]  scope of of what they're manufacturing is the schedule that they have to keep to do it it's
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:27:00.000]  very very precise and you know we were talking about johnny ive and what does it mean for
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.440]  art no longer to lead commerce i mean there was a moment you know after the iphone was born they
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:12.160]  were still making ipods and he had an idea for how to talk to somebody who's he was telling
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:19.680]  he was lamenting those he had an idea for a design change to the ipod that was like two weeks too
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:26.080]  late yeah to meet the to meet the schedule and and that meant that like he couldn't introduce it for
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:31.680]  a whole year by which point it might be stale and not work and and those are the type of sacrifices
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:36.960]  that all of a sudden you're having to make it limits it limits your your creativity a bit
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:43.200]  when you're doing things at scale in the way that apple has to do them because of how big it is
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:47.440]  yeah i love that story that's one of the i have that one highlighted in my copy of the book but
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:54.320]  i loved it because i'd never heard that before but and i can't i can't say that i know johnny ive
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:28:00.640]  well i've met him a few times but i think i understand his some to some degree his
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:09.280]  frustrations under post iphone post steve apple with the size and i think that exactly you know
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:16.000]  like is there possibly i i the feeling i got from that anecdote in your book is that it wasn't just
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.800]  that he came up with the idea too late it was that he came up with it at literally the worst
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:27.120]  time on the entire calendar like you know at least if he had had the idea three months later
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:31.600]  it's like well we've only got nine months to go whereas it was two weeks after the point of no
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:37.920]  return for this is where it's locked in for september launch and literally then 50 weeks
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:46.800]  before it could be brought to brought to bear and the next one around you know it it it it must be
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:51.840]  frustrating and and you also i know this is not a new story but like the story about with the
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:58.560]  original iphone where when steve jobs introduced it at macworld expo in january of 2007 it had a
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:06.960]  plastic screen and shortly thereafter jobs you know carrying around prototypes realized his
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:11.680]  keys were scratching up the screen we've got to get it to glass the thing was already announced
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:18.480]  had to ship in june and they made it happen you know with corning he calls the corning talks to
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:26.160]  the ceo says all of your glass sucks and which of course who does that right except for steve jobs
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:30.880]  and instead of hanging up on them the corning ceo is like well we do have this thing called gorilla
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:37.040]  glass that we're working on and then they make it happen right and there's there's tim cook right
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:45.680]  like coming into that you know tim cook's role in that early 2007 is it's not like a minor change
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:51.440]  like hey let's change the color of the plastic a little bit you know or the color of orange
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:55.440]  underneath the mute switch let's let's let's go with a different shade of orange or something
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:30:01.360]  like that it's an altogether different material for the screen on a device that was all screen
[01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:11.920]  and they made it happen i feel like that's exactly what johnny i've just profoundly missed about
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:17.520]  the earlier days you know that you could come up with an idea like that and make it happen because
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:25.680]  the scale that apple was operating at was so much smaller right definitely yeah yeah no you're right
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:32.960]  i mean that's there was a nimbleness that that afforded them time to make changes or pursue
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:38.560]  something that that in later years they just couldn't i mean i don't know what you the home
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:45.120]  planet's like a great example of this right like what value does that really add to apple's apple
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:52.640]  apple's profitability and its bottom line it it would be hard to sell enough speakers to to to to
[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:59.280]  add enough zeros to what they make on an annual basis for a product like that to be worthwhile yet
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:04.000]  at the same time they had to kind of jump into that because amazon was there so there were
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:09.280]  competitive reasons to jump into it but from a pure business standpoint there was no real reason
[01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:14.160]  to be in that in that business yeah and then they got out of it in a very un-apple-like way where
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:18.800]  they were just like you know just sort of well we're gonna we're gonna stop making the big home
[01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:23.440]  pod and now if you'd like one just you have to get the home pod mini and that's it and it just sort
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:31.360]  of it was just sort of like a sad little wah wah you know it right it it and it's unlike apple not
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:35.200]  to stick with something right like you mentioned that with the apple watch where okay maybe the
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:42.000]  first one was arguably underpowered maybe almost inarguably a little bit underpowered didn't have
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:48.080]  quite the battery life it should have and they just were already hard at work on the next years
[01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:51.920]  and the next years and the next years and every september there's a new one with better battery
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:57.280]  life and eventually it was only a handful of years before they got to what they clearly wanted to do
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:02.880]  all along which is keep the time on the watch all the time even if it's like in a reduced power
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:08.000]  state where the second hand doesn't rotate but you can at least glance at it and see the time
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:13.040]  no matter what it they didn't do that with home pod and i i you know i i don't think you have to
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:17.680]  you don't need lots of sources inside apple to sort of figure out that they just sort of looked
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:23.040]  at it and at some point tim cook's side of the organization said this just isn't worth it for
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:30.560]  us you know however that that that one was it was undermined so much by the challenges with siri and
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:38.000]  then the struggles internally working across different silos inside the company right getting
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.720]  the siri team and the software team and the design team to kind of all work harmoniously
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:47.600]  to make something that was fully thought out yeah i was told repeatedly in my reporting was just a
[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:59.280]  real a real challenge one of the things that comes across i i tim cook to me is inscrutable
[01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:08.160]  from the outside in a way that jobs wasn't i mean clearly when steve jobs was on stage doing an
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:14.800]  introduction you know he was in showman mode and and had a different persona and certainly you
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:23.600]  know the the fact that he could be abrasive kurt however many other adjectives you'd like to
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:29.840]  describe how he worked internally and demanding right it's clearly demanding but it would come
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:36.320]  out on stage sometimes i mean i i i love the story of the keynote i forget which year it was
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:41.920]  but it was towards the end of jobs his career there but they had some kind of demo at i think
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:48.320]  wwdc because it was a big big big room with thousands of people and the wi-fi demo didn't
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:56.320]  work for like the the new iphone that he was introducing and he his persona on stage changed
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:02.080]  and you could kind of see the real steve jobs or at least that other side of the real steve jobs
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:06.960]  and then they went on with some other demo and he came back out and and said we've figured out
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:13.440]  we've figured out what's going on it's it's you people out in the audience there's 400 pocket
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:18.800]  wi-fi networks set up for people who are live blogging the keynote i need you to shut them all
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:26.480]  off and do you remember this isn't it no oh my god this is real and it's like and if you're sitting
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:31.280]  next to someone who has one make them shut it off do you know if you guys want want this demo to
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:36.560]  continue you're going to shut off these why you know like tim cook never has a moment like that
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:44.640]  right again public he he's he is but he's also just so steady steady and skilled i mean i mean
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:48.800]  to your point like i mean one of my favorite moments in the book is you know in his dealings
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:56.080]  with trump and how masterfully he managed both external messaging and and his messaging to trump
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:00.960]  that he had this this day he was gearing up to go in for a meeting with a bunch of other ceos
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:07.920]  he was seated right to the right of trump in preparation for that apple leaked to axios that
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:13.680]  he was going to confront trump over the immigration order and then so all the all the
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:18.480]  trump administration people are coming in going like oh my god this is going to be such a disaster
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:24.720]  like trump's going to explode on camera and chew out the ceo of apple like they were in full
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:30.560]  preparation to go into damage damage control mode and they go through this entire meeting nothing
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:37.200]  happens and as he's kind of breezing his way out the door tim cook says someone quietly to trump
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:42.400]  i wish he would put more heart into your immigration strategy and your immigration policy
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:48.240]  and then that becomes a headline in axios later in the day that he quote confronted trump and
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:54.000]  everything else and it and it was conveyed and relayed back to you know a workforce in cupertino
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:00.960]  that was really agitated about this but i i think there's just some artfulness to to tim code's
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:06.160]  ability to kind of navigate situations like that and it flows directly from the inscrutability you
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:14.000]  talk about it's a real asset of this and he really is just unflappable but you hear these
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:21.280]  stories there's the famous one with um i'm drawing a blank on his name the the operations person and
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:27.040]  and they saw the car yeah sabi khan and somebody's got to get to china to figure this out and five
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:31.200]  minutes later he turns to him at the same meeting it's like why are you still here and he's like oh
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:38.640]  i get it and and he just gets up pulls his chair back gets in a car head straight to sfo to get on
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:42.480]  the next flight to china and doesn't even have like a bag packed he's got like what like his
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:47.760]  macbook that's it he's just he's just gonna buy clothes at the airport or when he lands in china
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:53.840]  and but that's he's like oh i get it i understand what how do you know i understand how important
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:58.800]  this is to you and therefore i'm going right to the airport you don't see that tim cook in public
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:06.240]  no but but also what what is that tim cook right like if you know jobs upbraiding a bunch of
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:12.960]  journalists around their wi-fi all in is is diplomatic of the same same character he was
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:18.000]  you know reprimanding staff behind the scenes but with with cook you're talking about somebody who
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:23.280]  people had a people who worked for him on a line of trepidation bringing new people in to present
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:28.800]  to him because he was known to take a deck and flip through it and if he was unsatisfied with
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:33.120]  it in the middle of somebody providing a presentation about it he would flip the page
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:40.480]  and literally say next in just like the iciest coldest fashion and it would cause uh young staff
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:46.880]  to like leaf in tears right so it's it's not like mean and he's not yelling at somebody but it has
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:55.680]  an equally chilling effect and and sets a high bar that that causes staff to to work their ass
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:38:01.600]  off to meet it an enormous amount of what he's you know he's famous for operations but he's got
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:08.080]  his his right-hand man jeff williams uh who's so cook-like in so many ways it's kind of bizarre
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:14.400]  to to run operations but it seems like in in the post steve era of being a ceo
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:24.480]  perhaps the the biggest change in tim cook's responsibilities to me seems to be politics and
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:30.320]  that that's both outside apple like you know having four years of donald trump in the white
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:38.160]  house and dealing with that as the ceo of america's leading most profitable company and a technology
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:42.800]  you know and and and the way you know it's not just trump's personality he had to deal with it
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:51.680]  was with trump waging a trade war with china and not having china decide to reciprocate by
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:57.760]  punishing apple apple kind of sailed through that you know as huawei was being blacklisted around
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:03.040]  the world from you know being you know like supplying 5g antennas and stuff like that
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:07.520]  apple didn't really suffer from that there was no reciprocation towards apple from china and
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:12.080]  you know i think that's to tim crooks credit but then there's the politics inside the company as
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:16.560]  well which is a lot of what you're reporting is about there there's to me one of the most
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:23.520]  interesting stories that i have never heard before i is the some of the backstory between
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:28.720]  the the beats act what what what what tell me something and what like what to you what to you
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:33.920]  in your reporting was most interesting about the beats acquisition they met i just didn't expect
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:40.480]  and that none of the people from beats who are acquired expected was to to go into apple and
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:45.280]  find out that apple was was already well on its way in terms of building out its own subscription
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:51.760]  music service and so they were they thought they were coming in bringing this product and beats
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:57.040]  music that was killed going to be the foundation for apple music and apple was already art at work
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:02.640]  and developing its its its own version of that and so they they wound up having to fuse the two
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:07.360]  together that that surprised me i just i didn't anticipate that i didn't realize that was something
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:13.120]  they were at work on because much of their public positioning around subscription music services was
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:17.360]  we think people should buy their music right we don't we don't believe in we don't believe in
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:22.560]  people just subscribing to music on a monthly basis right that people want to own their music
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:31.200]  and and it's you know they they've that's a hard thing for a company to move from because i think
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:40.000]  they really meant it and they did build a phenomenal music store you know and rejuvenated
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:46.800]  the music sales industry at a time when the competition wasn't really cds it was piracy
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:52.000]  right and you know got money got people buying albums and buying singles i mean they brought
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:57.680]  back the single which hadn't really been a thing since like the 1960s my mom i remember growing up
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:02.800]  my mom had a bunch of she was she was much more of a singles purchaser in her single life than
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:08.160]  an album purchaser so we we just had hundreds and hundreds of singles from like the beatles and the
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:13.280]  stones and that's what what our household record collection was like but it was she and my mom's
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:17.280]  perspective is exactly like what apple wound up doing with the itunes store which is why would i
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:22.320]  buy the whole album i only wanted these two songs but they you know to to admit not not admit defeat
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:27.120]  but admit that times and tastes are changing and if they want to stay relevant i mean at this point
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:34.640]  just a few short years into the apple music era it would be almost sad if if they didn't have a
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:40.000]  streaming music service and we're still only selling songs on itunes because that's just not
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:45.280]  how people listen to music now and if anything it's they i was just gonna say that i mean they
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:50.320]  nearly lost kind of i don't know this thing that they took so much pride in which was their
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:57.040]  their connection to the music industry you know because spotify was sailing past it at that point
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:02.400]  they were almost a beat too late to the party they got there literally just in time granted
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:06.320]  the product was a little bit flawed at the outset i think one of the fascinating things about that
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:12.000]  is it didn't matter you know that it was flawed people still wound up subscribing at levels that
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:17.920]  exceeded their own expectations internally i but they're they are number two to spotify which
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:24.240]  must rankle and you know it's it's it's a weird spot for apple to be in in my opinion because
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:28.960]  it's not it's not a failure it's not something they should move on from it's not you know like
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:35.520]  the home pod it's it but they are number two and there's a sense i think that they should be number
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:43.520]  one but they're not and i'm curious how that's how you think that sits inside apple thank you
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:48.800]  i'm sure they're dissatisfied with that i mean you could chalk it up to the fact that spotify's
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:55.600]  numbers are greater as a consequence of android users being subscribers and that apple is not
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:43:04.080]  really shown a full willingness to go beyond the walled garden but that's still core to what they
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:09.680]  believe should be you know their subscriber base and then when you look at their their their
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:15.760]  long-term strategy as mark german's reported over at bloombird there's this increasing push towards
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:22.000]  a full subscription offering an apple subscription offering in the future all i am is on prime and
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:27.360]  then maybe there's some pricing advantage that they can they can secure over over spotify that
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:32.480]  that gives them a leg up but so long as spotify is still relying on android users they're never
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:38.560]  globally going to be able to surpass them because i bought so many fewer subscribers worldwide than
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:43.520]  android does yeah for reasons that i don't i think are very hard to put your finger on
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:53.120]  apple's foray into apple music on android has never really gained traction to my knowledge i
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:58.720]  don't know what the numbers look like inside apple but it doesn't seem to me like anybody on android
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:05.040]  really gives much thought to apple music as opposed to when apple made the decision
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:12.800]  20 years ago to to move the ipod to windows and gain tremendous you know that that's what made
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:21.120]  the ipod explode in popularity was going beyond the mac as as the the computer you had to use with
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:25.840]  an ipod to okay we'll support any computer and we'll make we'll make itunes as good as we can
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:30.960]  make it and people actually liked using itunes on windows which i know people find hard to believe
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:36.160]  is with all the complaints over the way the music app works now but it was it was just you know
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:41.200]  jobs described it as a glass of ice water to people in hell and you know it i don't know it
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:46.560]  never it hasn't taken off the the one of the anecdotes well i was gonna say go with the
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:51.200]  anecdote but i was gonna say it's funny because like apple's whole ethos when it comes to like
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:56.960]  taking on big projects is you know taking whatever conventional wisdom might be out there
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:04.000]  and and bringing a whole new perspective to it that allows them to leapfrog whatever existing
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:08.960]  products exist but they still seem so wedded internally to the walled garden and the walled
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:16.880]  garden ethos that it's been hard for those who advocate making a service available on android
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:22.400]  to really get that service to be treated with the same kind of care and concern that they would
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:28.240]  bring to the native the service on native apple there's an anecdote in the book when when the
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:34.080]  beats deal was i guess sealed you know or or nearly sealed and it came down to the question
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:44.000]  of titles you know what what would jimmy iovine's title be at apple and it i think that what what
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:49.920]  it's so there was the idea it was floated of him being called chief chief creative officer right
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:55.440]  chief creative a new title created just for him sort of like the way that the chief design officer
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:46:01.280]  title was created specifically for johnny i've and phil shiller objected to it on the grounds
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:08.480]  of something to the effect of what are the rest of us not creative and it's like that's that's
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:14.960]  the sort of that's the internal politics that i see as tim cook having you know i think you
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:20.960]  know from the outside and having read the book and from my perspective navigated very well but there
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:28.160]  are big personalities within apple right and you don't think that because apple's ethos is sort of
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:32.560]  it's apple that makes the products you don't put people's names on the products there's very few
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:38.240]  people who get credited you know in a keynote it's it's apple who does this but within the company
[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:43.840]  there's definitely big egos yeah certainly certainly i mean i think the you know there's
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:49.520]  a whole chapter that deals with one of the biggest egos that apple ever had which is scott forestall
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:56.240]  and and how that ego and some of his swagger and some of his political i don't know they're
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:00.800]  infighting and some of the political blood sport behind the scenes during the jobs period when
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:06.720]  jobs was kind of uber ego and kind of made sure everybody was balanced correctly came back to
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:12.880]  bite forestall after jobs after jobs death yeah what's what's your take on forestall's ouster
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:21.840]  it's clear based on my reporting that it it was related to maps but it was not because of maps
[01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:28.880]  and that's a fine line but you know forestall famously told cook that he wouldn't apologize
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:36.000]  for the maps thing right the rationale according to people close to foresaw is that he felt that
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:44.560]  if an apology was issued it would have a negative effect internally on the workforce and and lead
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:52.080]  lead staff to to shy away from being ambitious and pursue something ambitious and and maybe
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:57.680]  not not embarking on a project because they didn't want to be reprimanded publicly or shamed
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:02.560]  publicly which is which is like an actually that's like a sophisticated rationale it's not like
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:07.840]  no i don't want the embarrassment of apologizing it's like hey what are the long-term consequences
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:14.000]  of an apology and leaning into kind of the antinogate philosophy of jobs but ultimately
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:24.400]  when it came down to it he just didn't he he battled so much with his peers and was seen and
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:31.120]  perceived to be somebody who was a collegial that in this new tim cook era where there was going to
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:36.720]  have to be product developed by consensus he didn't fit not to mention and i don't know the
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:43.040]  answer to this i mean he was he was one of the few people that his peers considered to be be the one
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:49.440]  who thought he could also be ceo right so so that that that's another factor there like you know if
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:54.800]  you're tim cook and you're taking over the reins and there's one guy at the the round table so to
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:59.200]  speak because there's what 10 10 to 12 people who meet every monday and make the decisions for the
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:03.200]  company and there's one guy who thinks he can do the job does he pose a threat to you or not
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:10.400]  yeah that's an interesting side angle on the forestall saga i my understanding and i think
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:17.360]  i think we're largely in agreement here is that if maps was if the maps launch mattered at all
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:24.080]  it was only as the straw that broke the camel's back you know that and i think that the the
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:29.760]  there's a common misconception that that was the whole thing that maps was so bad and forestall
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:35.360]  wouldn't apologize out of obstinance and so he you know he was he was canned but i think it was
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:41.600]  i think what happened i think the fundamental error that scott forestall made was that he
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:52.320]  vastly underestimated how much of his political clout outside his group was because he was
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:50:00.320]  steve's software guy and that it was it was yeah i think he conflated steve's clout and authority
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:09.360]  with his own and right and got blindsided by the fact that his peers at the company at the svp
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:13.760]  level didn't didn't like him and didn't like working for them i mean it's been reported
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:19.280]  elsewhere but for a long time that that at some point johnny i've told tim cook i'm not meeting
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:25.920]  with him anymore which seems like a problem yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean they'd they'd famously had
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:32.080]  to dust up over the air into the gate saga because forestall thought it was his fault then when he
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:38.640]  found out it was because of the hardware he kind of he brought some internal shame on johnny that
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:43.200]  wasn't appreciated so there was just bad blood there that had built up over the years that
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:49.120]  that people could make peace with because john was there to pacify everybody but when john was
[01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:55.600]  just taken out of the equation you know they everyone turned turn on scott and he was he was
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:51:01.840]  ultimately fine here's my last question to me i've always compared steve jobs's role at apple
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:07.520]  to that of a movie director that you know that the director maybe doesn't doesn't write the
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:15.680]  screenplay doesn't operate the camera doesn't appear on as an actor on the show but it's the
[01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:22.560]  director who is saying this is what it should look like this is good enough that's not good enough do
[01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:28.560]  another take not good enough not good enough okay that looks good enough it it's the arbiter of
[01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:34.080]  whose taste is it who's ultimately saying okay this is what we should do this is how good this
[01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:38.960]  effort is i don't i don't you know obviously this is not i don't think that's like a a deep insight
[01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:47.040]  into steve jobs's role at apple but who's that person after steve jobs right was it i think for
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:55.360]  a while it it was pretty clear that in the 2011 to 2015 era that person was johnny i've right and
[01:51:55.360 --> 01:52:01.440]  that was part of johnny taking after forestall was ousted taking over the role of software design in
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:08.800]  addition to hardware design correct yeah i i think there's a strong case to be made that he became
[01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:13.120]  the person driving product forward and that's why the book spent so much time writing about
[01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:18.560]  the watch because because he did drive that product and and that's that's why apple had
[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:24.160]  a new product category in that period i think it's an open question of of who is that at this point
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:29.680]  and does apple need an individual or can it do it by consensus you know i think increasingly product
[01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:34.640]  marketing has a much bigger voice and what apple's doing on the product side of things but does it you
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:39.600]  know is is jaws that person i i don't know i think we're i think there's still a bit of a shakeout
[01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:47.120]  and and people may find it unsatisfying in the book because the book ends in 2019 but but i i do
[01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:53.760]  think apple needs that type of figure and i even johnny was he wasn't quite he wasn't the director
[01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:59.920]  that steve was right because he he benefited from steve's our direction right i you know and
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:05.040]  i know it's again an overused analogy but that they were sort of like lenin and mccartney where
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:11.680]  they made each other better and tempered each other's weaknesses you know they they built up
[01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:17.840]  each other's strengths and tempered each other's weaknesses and one without the other was you know
[01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:22.960]  the lenin and mccartney both had great solo songs afterwards but nothing that was like their
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:28.640]  collaboration with the beatles and you could argue you know i i think a lot of people have that that
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:35.760]  a lot of the designs that people raise an eyebrow about in the last 10 years at apple maybe a little
[01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:40.400]  bit too much johnny and not enough steve and you know it's obvious that steve isn't there so of
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:46.960]  course there's no steve into it but that you can kind of see it you know yeah i think it's a great
[01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:53.360]  question i didn't i'd take any further back i mean the entire history of apple is built around pears
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:54:02.000]  i mean it was it was was the jobs who who created the company it was jobs and johnny who revived it
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:09.040]  it was johnny and tim i'd argue over the past decade who sustained it and insured and endured
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:15.360]  after job's death and i think the question now is it's tim and who lead it forward i mean one
[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:19.520]  you could you can make the case just based on what they've been doing and succeeding and lately that
[01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:25.600]  maybe it's johnny shruji that that steve jobs had his johnny and now tim cook has his johnny and
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:32.320]  that that chips and apple sophistication and chip design are going to be key to what it's able it's
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:37.600]  able to accomplish over the next decade you close the book talking about we mentioned omerta and
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:43.520]  the sort of code of silence at apple and you know i think one do you know you could stretch any
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:49.520]  any analogy to the mafia is going to going to wear thin eventually because they're not it's not
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:54.800]  a criminal enterprise at apple although i guess the ec might might disagree to some to some degree
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:55:00.480]  but part of it to me is it's it's not just fear right like one thing i've learned over my career
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:07.680]  is it's i used to think sometimes when people would leave apple and go elsewhere that they
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:12.240]  still wouldn't talk about their time at apple because they wanted to leave the door open to
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:19.920]  go back and i know i have many friends and and even more acquaintances sources who've been at
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:25.520]  apple left and then come back you know it it it absolutely happens it's a regular thing that's
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:31.680]  how people build a career you know in the industry but i've i've learned over the years that even
[01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:39.040]  people who i don't think have any plans to come back who've you know for if they're young enough
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:43.680]  they're just they've built something else and maybe taken a position of prominence or or founded
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:48.720]  a startup or something like that or maybe they're just retired right like i did my time i made
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:53.040]  plenty of money from stocks and you know i'm not going back but they still don't really talk about
[01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:58.960]  it publicly um because i think it's it's not a fear i think it's it's a personality right that
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:06.080]  they're a certain type of person and they respect that that code of silence and i'm curious curious
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:10.800]  if if you detect that in your with with how many sources you spoke to for the book if you detect
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:19.360]  that yeah i mean they they they take sort of a vow of silence right and i think there's a there's
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:24.880]  a concern about being ostracized so whether you want to go back to apple or not you still have
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:30.160]  lots of friends there and if you become somebody who's known as a talker you run the risk of being
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:36.000]  ostracized by that community i think one of my favorite stories early early on in right you know
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:41.120]  in coming into the world of apple and learning about it is that apple didn't really have much
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:47.600]  of an alumni network or meetings like in the same way that ex-googlers have where they still get
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:54.000]  together and connect and and and they somebody spun up one of these meetings one time and
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:00.160]  a bunch of the apple alums are there and they didn't know what to talk to each other about because
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:04.800]  it was kind of verboten like you did you didn't you didn't talk about like what you did at apple so
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:10.400]  like here the very the very reason that you're all connected is because of the company and yet you
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:15.360]  weren't with nobody was willing to be like oh and i worked in finance and here's what i did
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:22.240]  so yeah i mean it it it's amazing the degree to which people buy into that and how long it's
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:27.840]  been sustained and held and i think it's fascinating to watch the company now at like
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:35.280]  140 000 plus employees and lots of new employees trying to hold on to that ethos and it's becoming
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:41.760]  harder and harder for them to do yeah i think so too and i think we've we've seen some cracks in
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:49.600]  that over the the covet era of things leaking to the press that typically didn't leak before
[01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:55.760]  you know the the verge had a bunch of stories from apple's internal slack messaging group about
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:58:01.840]  work from home policy and and stuff like that and you know conversations that never would have
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:09.120]  typically hit the press starting to hit the press and i i do you know it's like i'm turning into the
[01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:14.720]  old man on the porch yelling at the clouds but it's you know it's clearly younger people you
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:19.760]  know who who've grown up with different a different set of expectations i mean and i
[01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:26.480]  think a company culture has to um has to evolve right as times change company culture has to i
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:32.560]  mean what how can a company stay exactly the same that the trick is how do you hold on to the parts
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:38.880]  that you need to hold on to and how do you let go of the other parts 100 and i think i did full
[01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:43.600]  credit to tim cote for finding a way to do that because they're still having tremendous success
[01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:50.000]  yeah what what's your sense of the success of apple university it depends on who you talk to
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:55.440]  if you talk to old timers at apple they think who have like come back i don't know i presume
[01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:59.600]  you've taught some of these people who've come back and rejoined the company and gone through
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:07.280]  a bit of an orientation they they think it's a little i guess passe or maybe it leans too far
[01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:14.000]  into some of the jobs ethos and and and highlights what apple aspires to be but it's disconnected
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:20.720]  from what apple is in present day but it still has value you know i you know you go through
[01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:26.240]  orientation anytime you join a new company and that's a tremendous resource to have but i i
[01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:31.680]  i mean i would love to give through it and learn what they teach people i'm sure there's
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:36.880]  there's learnings from it that they can benefit other corporations as they try to preserve and
[01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:43.280]  protect the culture that they've created yeah my i i my sense i don't have a great sense of it i
[01:59:43.280 --> 01:59:52.320]  think it's about as successful as it could be but that ultimately in a business of tech in a
[01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:59.520]  business like apple is where it's about technology every every new challenge is sufficiently unlike
[01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:05.600]  the previous challenges that it's the that that historical perspective isn't as useful as as i
[02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:12.240]  think steve jobs had hoped when he when he initiated the program you know that it's it's
[02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:17.680]  each new challenge is its own challenge and the reason it's a challenge is because it's on you
[02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:22.400]  know if it was easy if it was easy to apply a previous lesson it wouldn't be a challenge
[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:30.720]  right right but it but it it does help people who are arriving at the company understand or
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:37.200]  deepen their appreciation for some of the legacy thought process right of taking conventional
[02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:42.960]  wisdom and trying to find ways around it you've been very very generous with your time i want
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:47.040]  to wrap up i i'm gonna i'm gonna offer there's one thing i have to i just have to mention this
[02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:51.280]  because i don't again i've never heard this before maybe it's been out there but to me the single
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:56.080]  most surprising little tiny detail in your book is that at least at one point tim cook's favorite
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:01:03.840]  beverage was mountain dew oh yeah yeah they flew it over to asia just just a habit there for him
[02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:09.280]  you know which is which is wild because he was also not he was like eating you know baked chicken
[02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:15.440]  and broccoli right for most meals so there's this inherent disconnect between his favorite beverage
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:19.920]  and kind of the food he consumed right he's hitting the gym every day at four in the morning
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:24.960]  and he's you know he's very obviously very fit he's been involved you know famously eats well
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:31.840]  but his favorite beverage is perhaps the most you know similar to like battery acid soda on the
[02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:39.600]  market but also super high in caffeine right right yeah yeah they made sure that they had like a case
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:43.680]  of it when they would be cute when they flew over for this big meeting because they knew he would
[02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:48.320]  expect it when he was there what else can you can you give me one more story that you really that
[02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:53.520]  you're really proud of in the book i just think the two interesting things about about these these
[02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:58.560]  guys that are worth thinking about one like i didn't expect to find out on my visit to robertsdale
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:04.000]  alabama that that tim cook is somewhat of a pariah in his own town i mean i'm from the southeast
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:10.800]  typically when somebody achieves what he has accomplished from a small town everybody is like
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:16.720]  local boy done good they're happy to talk about him but because he put a spotlight on racial
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:23.760]  tensions in the town by telling a story about a cross burning there there's real i don't know
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:27.840]  there's real kind of disdain there for him which i was surprised by that's not something i
[02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:33.040]  anticipated on the flip side on the johnny side i don't have the answer to this but i think it's
[02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:37.840]  fascinating that people who have worked with him for many years question whether or not he has like
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:43.680]  x-ray vision or a different or different like sophistication with his eyesight than the rest
[02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:48.960]  of us and there's this this probably my favorite anecdote in the book is there's this moment where
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:54.240]  he and a colleague from operations are flying traveling back from china and they show up at
[02:02:54.240 --> 02:03:01.360]  the airport and they're sitting at the bar and he looks down this this steel bar this metal bar
[02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:06.960]  and he grumbles i can see every seam in this bar and the guy looks at him and he looks down at the
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:13.200]  bar and all he can see is smooth metal and he's like your life must be miserable you know and and
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:17.760]  nobody really knows like you know does he see things different but it goes all the way to the
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:25.360]  point of like i think in his studio he's got a got a glass table set up on four freestanding legs and
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:30.000]  he would just come in one day and be like oh the table's the table's bowing in the middle we need
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:35.040]  to replace it and everybody would look at it and be like i literally can't see anything but he was
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:39.120]  convinced it was bowing and nobody wanted to question her because it just seemed like he could
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:43.520]  see something that the rest of the world couldn't yeah the actual quote from your book is your your
[02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:50.320]  life must be fucking miserable i wasn't sure if that was kosher on the oh good enough if johnny
[02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:54.480]  said if johnny i've said it i think we can i think we can let it fly without getting the explicit
[02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:58.800]  label on the podcast but i do think that's true though right and it's it's it's the curse of
[02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:07.040]  anybody who has an eye for something like i'm personally deeply afflicted by a profound dislike
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:13.520]  for the font ariel the the helvetica knockoff and i see it everywhere i can you know what johnny
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:20.240]  i've can see to just about anything mechanical i see ariel everywhere that it's used and every
[02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:25.200]  place where it's used it would look better if it was helvetica and it is it's a curse it's a
[02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:29.760]  minor curse because it's like the most popular typeface in the world because you start up
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:35.680]  anything on windows and what's the default font it's ariel so people use it everywhere but i see
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:41.760]  it every time and i can't i wish i wish i could if i could if i could sever that part of my brain
[02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:46.240]  as in this the tv show severance i don't want to forget what i do when i work but if you could make
[02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:51.280]  it so that i'd no longer notice when people use ariel it it would make my life a little better
[02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:56.160]  you need like a chrome extension it'll just change your like everything on your computer
[02:04:56.800 --> 02:05:01.200]  to some other font i've thought about that i've done that though i've used font book on the mac
[02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:06.240]  you can't do it on iphone but i've disabled ariel which would fill it in with helvetica but now
[02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:11.360]  they've changed it in the most i don't want to go off but you can't disable ariel anymore it's like
[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:16.400]  a system font that can't be turned off but anyway trip thank you for the time and i i really do i
[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:21.920]  enjoy the book i don't necessarily agree with all of your conclusions in it but it it is remarkably
[02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:26.960]  deeply reported and i really do mean it not just because you're here as a guest on the show
[02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:31.920]  people who listen to this show and like this they really should get the book and read it because
[02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:38.160]  it's there's just so so many little things that have never been reported before really and then
[02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:43.440]  the fact that you did so much of this reporting during covid is is even more impressive because
[02:05:43.440 --> 02:05:48.240]  it's like you said like a lot of this is reporting people underestimate just how much of reporting is
[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:57.360]  just actual gumshoe get your ass to you know alabama or go just go knock on doors put put slips
[02:05:57.360 --> 02:06:03.040]  of paper in their mailbox and and talk to people that must have been so hard during covid yeah yeah
[02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:07.600]  it was uh it was an adventure by the same token i had no phone because nobody was doing anything
[02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:12.800]  fun while i was sitting there writing this book so and it kind of was that maybe i if i was ever
[02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:19.760]  going to write a book maybe that was the time to write a book yeah absolutely yeah next pandemic
[02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:25.680]  you can sit down after steve is the name of the book and it's uh trip mickle you can buy it
