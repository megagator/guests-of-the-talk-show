[00:00.000 --> 00:01.680]  Federico
[00:01.680 --> 00:04.280]  John, oh, I'm so excited to have you here. Oh
[00:05.160 --> 00:08.080]  I'm glad to be on the show. I have no idea what we're gonna talk about
[00:08.600 --> 00:15.040]  I'm just well I can tell you I did my research all the things you care about so we're gonna talk about the Mac Pro and
[00:17.120 --> 00:19.600]  Watches and American sports
[00:23.180 --> 00:25.180]  I'm ready. Oh
[00:25.180 --> 00:30.420]  Did you see did you see I mean just this is just knock it out of the way easy. Did you see?
[00:32.180 --> 00:34.180]  Marquez Brownlee's
[00:34.260 --> 00:39.420]  Video where yes, I did. He got the wheels for the Mac Pro and
[00:40.100 --> 00:47.060]  No brakes on those wheels and there they spin so freely like and the floor of whatever room
[00:47.060 --> 00:50.700]  He was in is obviously off by like maybe like a half of a degree
[00:50.700 --> 00:56.900]  It's obviously not like a crooked floor. It's a very nice looking group. And when he just lets go of the Mac Pro
[01:00.580 --> 01:07.980]  You don't want a computer to run away from you like a 30 30 to 40 thousand dollar computer just going away
[01:10.900 --> 01:15.380]  Yeah, I mean I don't I don't plan on buying a Mac Pro anytime soon
[01:15.380 --> 01:19.560]  But if I were to buy a Mac Pro, I totally would get the wheels. Oh, really?
[01:19.560 --> 01:22.000]  Yeah, I mean, it's it just looks fun
[01:22.880 --> 01:24.240]  see
[01:24.240 --> 01:26.280]  Yeah, how much are the wheels?
[01:29.640 --> 01:31.640]  400 yeah, there are hundred dollars each
[01:33.200 --> 01:36.400]  Yeah, I love that they don't come with locks
[01:38.000 --> 01:43.360]  So I was thinking like it's so strange I'm a I mean guess maybe it's too soon
[01:43.360 --> 01:49.360]  But maybe somebody like Belkin, you know, these like third-party manufacturers that have like a relationship with Apple
[01:49.360 --> 01:51.360]  Maybe they should make a version that has locks. I
[01:52.040 --> 01:55.320]  I can't help but think that there will be I mean because
[01:56.400 --> 01:58.560]  you know that there's it because the the
[01:59.360 --> 02:07.200]  Pro display XDR has take standard visa mounting, you know, there's already it doesn't you know, nobody has to make it custom for it
[02:07.200 --> 02:09.200]  There's already all sorts of standard
[02:10.040 --> 02:12.920]  Arms and wall mounts you can get for it and stands
[02:12.920 --> 02:18.760]  I can't help but feel that there's going to be third-party options for the wheels and stuff like that
[02:19.760 --> 02:24.040]  Mm-hmm. Maybe the the one cost a hundred dollar per wheel
[02:25.040 --> 02:27.040]  Also, that'd be nice. I
[02:27.920 --> 02:30.920]  Just remember I haven't seen the wheels since
[02:32.600 --> 02:40.560]  WWDC uh-huh, you know like you did you you got to the hands-on area, right? Well, you know, I actually I never went
[02:40.560 --> 02:42.560]  I
[02:43.080 --> 02:45.080]  Was desperate for some coffee
[02:45.960 --> 02:51.040]  Like they serve the worst coffee like I was just looking I was just looking for some espresso
[02:51.160 --> 02:52.320]  but the
[02:52.320 --> 02:56.680]  What's the name of the place that closed down like social policy in San Jose?
[02:56.800 --> 03:00.480]  Yeah used to serve. Well some kind of espresso
[03:01.320 --> 03:06.160]  And it was like it was like the only place where I could get espresso in San Jose
[03:06.160 --> 03:10.680]  I guess San Jose like the whole place is mysteriously
[03:11.360 --> 03:13.360]  devoid of any sort of
[03:13.400 --> 03:20.760]  Normal coffee place but social policy used to have espresso and it was like five bucks for an espresso like totally insane
[03:21.200 --> 03:26.960]  But it closed and so last year after after the keynote. I had a terrible headache
[03:27.480 --> 03:29.480]  and so the
[03:29.880 --> 03:34.080]  PR tells me like hey, there's a hands-on area. You should go play around with the macro
[03:34.080 --> 03:38.120]  It's like yeah, maybe I will God I was just basically roaming around the convention area
[03:38.120 --> 03:40.640]  I'm just looking for an espresso and I never went
[03:41.440 --> 03:46.160]  And I kind of regret that it was across the street, which is unusual. I know
[03:47.960 --> 03:52.960]  Because a the the San Jose Convention Center is
[03:54.280 --> 03:58.280]  Enormous and you would think there would be plenty of space in there
[03:59.320 --> 04:02.720]  but they did have a truly I
[04:02.720 --> 04:09.800]  Mean, I'm not I don't I didn't really spend enough time in there. So I kind I did go in but I kind of missed out
[04:11.400 --> 04:17.600]  But I can kind of see why they did it across the street and it wasn't gonna be there all week and it was
[04:18.040 --> 04:20.040]  definitely not intended for
[04:20.880 --> 04:28.520]  Developer attendees. It was it was definitely set up as a press hands-on area that required an awful lot of Apple
[04:28.520 --> 04:30.520]  Staffing
[04:31.680 --> 04:35.760]  You know to you know, they had real pros from their real pro teams
[04:36.720 --> 04:41.760]  Talking about the tools, you know, it was not something that they that they intended to staff all week
[04:41.760 --> 04:44.480]  So I can see why they didn't set it up in the convention area
[04:44.480 --> 04:46.440]  But the fact that it was across the street
[04:46.440 --> 04:52.680]  I can kind of see why you didn't make it and and it sounds so funny because it's just quote unquote across the street
[04:52.680 --> 04:58.960]  But that street is a real pain in the ass to cross to because because there's like straight
[04:58.960 --> 05:01.800]  There's like trains that run down the middle of it. You can die
[05:03.720 --> 05:09.160]  It feels like there's hardly any cars which is a very unusual for America
[05:09.400 --> 05:16.960]  But there's trains that come by frequently and don't stop and could easily kill you and then the rest of the traffic are people on
[05:16.960 --> 05:18.960]  those rent-a-scooters
[05:19.280 --> 05:21.560]  Which are not dangerous at all
[05:21.560 --> 05:24.080]  Well, not dangerous to you as a pedestrian
[05:24.840 --> 05:32.480]  those scooters made their way to Europe and Italy specifically like just a few months ago a bunch of cities here started passing regulations to
[05:32.480 --> 05:38.400]  Allow the scooters, but I think we have more regulations that in the United States like more speed control and stuff
[05:39.320 --> 05:42.720]  So they may be less dangerous now, but I'm not sure
[05:43.360 --> 05:46.480]  Philadelphia them again where I live Philadelphia. They are
[05:47.320 --> 05:50.200]  because in America so many things are
[05:50.200 --> 05:52.120]  Left to
[05:52.120 --> 05:58.600]  not just states but cities, you know individual cities have different regulations and the city of Philadelphia
[05:59.120 --> 06:02.800]  qualifies them as motor vehicles and so you need like
[06:03.800 --> 06:05.720]  license plates and
[06:05.720 --> 06:10.120]  Driver's licenses. So we we have none none of them in Philadelphia
[06:10.120 --> 06:16.320]  Although it was funny, you know, these companies are so weird like lime. I think it was lime and
[06:16.320 --> 06:21.240]  Somebody figured out and my wife is one who found it, but she was just on like one of the local news sites
[06:21.240 --> 06:26.560]  You know just like a blog about Philadelphia stuff and you know, I don't know like a year ago. It was like
[06:27.400 --> 06:33.920]  Three limes showed up in Philadelphia. It's like somebody just fired up the lime app and it was like now there's three of them in Philadelphia
[06:33.920 --> 06:35.920]  Just three three scooters
[06:37.040 --> 06:43.280]  First a city of five million people and it was like is this real and it was like that
[06:43.280 --> 06:49.520]  And it was like is this real and it was like that's how like sometimes apparently that's how they like roll it out
[06:49.520 --> 06:53.520]  Sometimes it's like, you know, like I guess it's supposed to create buzz
[06:55.160 --> 06:58.960]  And then the city was like these are illegal and lime was like, oh, yeah
[06:58.960 --> 07:01.680]  We didn't mean to do that and then they took them away and it was like what do you mean?
[07:01.680 --> 07:04.400]  You didn't mean to do it. You know what I mean? Like what like
[07:05.000 --> 07:08.840]  Somebody drove their lime from you know, some other city
[07:08.840 --> 07:13.360]  And dropped it off in Philadelphia
[07:13.800 --> 07:15.440]  But anyway
[07:15.440 --> 07:21.000]  Anyway, I didn't really I didn't spend anywhere near as much time in that hands-on area as I wished that I had
[07:21.000 --> 07:23.600]  I had briefings and a couple other things and the next thing, you know
[07:23.600 --> 07:28.240]  I went to go back and they're like, uh, it's closed dude, and I was like, oh crap. Yeah
[07:28.520 --> 07:32.840]  Yeah, but did it have wheels? Yes, they they had the wheels there
[07:33.320 --> 07:34.440]  and
[07:34.440 --> 07:37.320]  I was actually talking to Jaws
[07:37.320 --> 07:40.840]  there and it was on Monday after the keynote and
[07:42.760 --> 07:48.840]  You know Jaws was on my show later that week too, but I was just chatting with him briefly there and I asked him if I
[07:48.840 --> 07:50.640]  could ride
[07:50.640 --> 07:54.920]  If I could ride the Mac Pro like like a little scooter and he said no
[07:57.440 --> 08:03.440]  But they did have the wheels and I got to play with them and I can vouch that at least at WWDC they were
[08:03.440 --> 08:06.880]  Very nice wheels. So I'm not surprised at all
[08:06.880 --> 08:13.080]  Like it's almost like the the MKBHD problem where it just starts rolling if your desktop or floor is
[08:13.400 --> 08:17.120]  Ever so slightly tilted. It's almost like you'd want them to be worse wheels
[08:17.120 --> 08:21.320]  You know what I mean? So that there'd be a little bit of friction so that you know, you kind of have to push it
[08:22.120 --> 08:27.080]  Yeah, I don't know. It just looks fun though. Like if I were to have a computer like that
[08:27.080 --> 08:31.240]  I would like you to have wheels just for the fun of it, you know
[08:31.240 --> 08:33.240]  Yeah, until it starts rolling away
[08:34.400 --> 08:37.680]  Maybe just get a long extension cable and that's gonna be fine
[08:38.880 --> 08:46.320]  All right, while we're talking about WWDC, let me mention something I'll bet this has come up in your circles as well, but
[08:48.480 --> 08:56.560]  The with this coronavirus that is spreading around there and I know it's only late February right now and
[08:56.560 --> 09:01.200]  WWDC almost certainly is scheduled for early June
[09:01.840 --> 09:07.800]  Which is where it's been every single year except for one for like the last I don't know 15 years
[09:10.000 --> 09:13.200]  And for like the last 10 years it's always been 10 11 12 years
[09:13.200 --> 09:16.720]  It's always been I think 2006 was the weird year where it was in August
[09:18.320 --> 09:19.920]  Is
[09:19.920 --> 09:27.920]  WWDC going to be canceled because of coronavirus is the question on a lot of people's minds and it seems ridiculous in February
[09:27.920 --> 09:35.360]  But I actually think like watching the news. I think that it's got to be I put the odds at around 30 to 40 percent chance
[09:35.360 --> 09:36.400]  Yes
[09:36.400 --> 09:42.800]  WWDC will be canceled. What do you have Facebook just Facebook just canceled their developer conference and they yep
[09:42.800 --> 09:45.800]  They and that's a May conference. That's yeah
[09:45.800 --> 09:53.920]  Yeah, so and I just saw on the news. I mean we're here in Italy the virus spread like super quickly like
[09:53.920 --> 09:59.840]  Yeah, it's weird. It's so weird because I'm like until last Thursday
[10:00.080 --> 10:04.480]  There were no confirmed cases basically. I'm from Friday up until today
[10:05.840 --> 10:11.680]  Like in so in six days we went from two cases to I think it's 600
[10:11.680 --> 10:20.720]  It's wild and I just saw on the news yesterday that California started seeing the first confirmed cases of the virus. So
[10:21.520 --> 10:26.720]  It's starting to look likely and a bunch. I also saw that a bunch of video game companies started pulling out from
[10:27.040 --> 10:30.240]  GDC so the game developers conference, which is in San Francisco
[10:30.640 --> 10:36.800]  Usually in March and it seems very likely that the whole thing is gonna be canceled as well
[10:36.800 --> 10:41.920]  So and I don't know. What do you think will happen if WWDC gets canceled?
[10:43.440 --> 10:48.400]  So if it gets canceled I would and let's assume
[10:50.640 --> 10:54.000]  That we're not looking at a a true
[10:54.880 --> 10:56.880]  global pandemic
[10:56.960 --> 10:59.920]  Right, and I mean, I don't think we can take that off the table at this point
[10:59.920 --> 11:00.960]  I think it's you know
[11:00.960 --> 11:06.960]  I think anybody who wants to be realistic about this can see that this is a very serious situation
[11:08.160 --> 11:10.160]  It's already, you know, I mean there's
[11:10.560 --> 11:15.040]  You know hundreds of people dead thousands tens of thousands sick around the world, especially in China
[11:15.040 --> 11:18.560]  So it's I'm not making light of of the situation right now today
[11:18.880 --> 11:23.120]  but I think anybody being realistic has to look at this and say this might be one of these like
[11:23.920 --> 11:26.240]  once in a generation things that that
[11:26.240 --> 11:32.560]  Truly is a pandemic and in that case, of course, everything's going to get cancelled, right? The whole world's going to be affected
[11:33.200 --> 11:36.480]  if it stays more like it is now right where it's
[11:37.280 --> 11:44.800]  It's still out there. It's still floating about there's still spreading. There's still you know, they're tracking, you know as it moves around the world
[11:45.840 --> 11:46.880]  and
[11:46.880 --> 11:51.520]  You know air travel is still a thing, you know, it's not like airlines and airports are shut down
[11:51.520 --> 11:56.640]  what I would guess Apple would do is hold
[11:57.760 --> 11:58.640]  a
[11:58.640 --> 12:04.240]  I well, I guess what they could do is they could either postpone until August or something like that or
[12:06.240 --> 12:09.920]  Kind of do it virtually I mean this is and you know
[12:10.480 --> 12:16.240]  Me chatting in a group slack with a bunch of friends is you know, just a spitball idea, but the idea would be
[12:16.240 --> 12:21.680]  Maybe what they would do is hold a press event at the steve jobs theater. Just invite media
[12:21.680 --> 12:24.480]  But again, is that even just that is inviting?
[12:25.280 --> 12:31.280]  300 media to a steve jobs theater is is even that problematic. I I don't know
[12:32.480 --> 12:36.960]  But this would be the idea it would be all right. What if they still hold a wwdc keynote?
[12:37.680 --> 12:42.080]  I don't know what they would call it because it's not really wwdc, but they still hold a wwdc
[12:42.080 --> 12:45.760]  I don't know what they would call it because it's not really wwdc
[12:45.920 --> 12:50.800]  But they would still hold the event to do all the stuff they want to announce right because apple likes
[12:52.080 --> 12:55.120]  doing that I think I I don't think that it's like
[12:56.160 --> 12:58.160]  mac world expo of
[12:58.320 --> 13:04.640]  Years gone by where apple eventually got to the point where they were they didn't like having this thing on the schedule
[13:05.120 --> 13:10.720]  In january and whether they're ready to announce anything or not. They have to do this keynote
[13:10.720 --> 13:16.880]  And when they had the opportunity to beg out of it, they they took it, you know, which effectively
[13:17.520 --> 13:22.240]  Canceled the whole conference because without that keynote there it just sort of took the air out of it
[13:22.640 --> 13:29.440]  I don't think they feel that way about wwdc. I think they like wwdc. I think they like having developers there. I think
[13:30.240 --> 13:32.240]  They find it energizing
[13:32.880 --> 13:35.680]  I really do. I know it's you know, it's a lot of work
[13:35.680 --> 13:40.400]  It's a lot of work for the engineers who do it right because the presentations are all
[13:41.040 --> 13:43.680]  done it's not like there's some special team of
[13:45.020 --> 13:50.560]  Wwdc presenters who who create all these sessions, you know if there's a session on
[13:51.980 --> 13:53.980]  Shortcuts what's new in shortcuts?
[13:54.320 --> 14:00.080]  It's presented by somebody or people multiple people right from the shortcuts team
[14:00.240 --> 14:03.600]  It's the people who made it who are the most intimately familiar with it who do it
[14:03.600 --> 14:08.640]  And it's you know, those presentations aren't things they whip together at the last minute, right?
[14:08.720 --> 14:12.960]  I mean, I I would guess they start they're they're starting to work on them now, right?
[14:14.960 --> 14:19.280]  So they could still do all of that work and and you know, I it's a lot of work
[14:19.280 --> 14:21.280]  But I feel like apple, you know
[14:21.360 --> 14:24.880]  It's worth it. Apple wants developers to use new stuff, right?
[14:25.040 --> 14:30.080]  And so without teaching and and having these sessions where you can learn about the new stuff. How are you going to do it?
[14:30.080 --> 14:33.840]  Right, so I don't think they it is a lot of work, but I don't think they resent it
[14:33.920 --> 14:36.500]  I think that they enjoy it. I think they like the opportunity
[14:36.960 --> 14:43.680]  but I guess what they could do if this virus virus makes them or or or they feel like they should even if they don't have
[14:43.760 --> 14:47.520]  To but feel like it's the the safe thing to do is cancel the actual
[14:48.160 --> 14:51.920]  Let's get five thousand people in san jose together is do it virtually
[14:52.560 --> 14:55.840]  And you know, that's how most people around the world actually experience
[14:55.840 --> 15:00.900]  WWDC anyway, right because there's you know, the with the lottery and everything
[15:01.460 --> 15:03.860]  I don't you know, there's five thousand attendees or so
[15:04.500 --> 15:12.660]  And obviously at this point tens of thousands of developers around the world who consume the entirety of WWDC via streaming
[15:13.380 --> 15:18.740]  So what if everybody did it via streaming and they just have the presentations. They still do all the work
[15:18.740 --> 15:20.740]  They would have done if it was going to go on
[15:20.740 --> 15:26.100]  But the entire thing goes through the WWDC app in terms of your experience
[15:26.340 --> 15:31.300]  And then the press event would just be for press only on monday morning and they'd have it at the steve jobs theater
[15:31.380 --> 15:33.380]  That's my football idea
[15:33.860 --> 15:35.860]  They could do that. And I mean they've also done
[15:36.900 --> 15:39.540]  In the past like when a new iphone comes out they have done
[15:40.980 --> 15:46.180]  New presentations for new technical features like new apis about the new camera, for example
[15:46.180 --> 15:51.780]  And they have just posted those on the developer website. So it's not totally new to
[15:52.500 --> 15:56.740]  Talk about new apis and it's just available via streaming, right?
[15:57.380 --> 16:01.620]  I guess the the main downside maybe is that you do lose with the remote event
[16:02.020 --> 16:05.540]  You lose the obviously the personal contact and for a lot of developers
[16:05.620 --> 16:07.620]  That's uh, there's a lot of value in
[16:07.700 --> 16:12.580]  You know being able to go to the labs and actually get your code in front of somebody who works at apple
[16:12.580 --> 16:15.540]  I can give you pointers and suggestions and you lose all of that
[16:15.540 --> 16:20.500]  Uh with a remote event, uh, and I highly doubt that apple would do some sort of
[16:21.140 --> 16:24.020]  chat feature where like a developer can I mean
[16:24.020 --> 16:30.580]  I guess it could be even possible for a developer to talk to somebody directly during WWDC week
[16:30.740 --> 16:36.180]  But I I mean going to the labs in person, um, like physically, uh, go there
[16:36.420 --> 16:41.380]  It's totally different experience and you will lose all of that but also like not having
[16:41.380 --> 16:45.300]  I think they should I I think I agree with you. They should still do some kind of
[16:45.860 --> 16:48.020]  WWDC even if it's just uh
[16:48.020 --> 16:55.700]  Like a like a streaming only one if only because it sets so much of the narrative for the year at least in terms of software
[16:56.100 --> 17:01.380]  Uh, it's it's a as you said it's a way for apple to they like doing this because it's also a way for them to share
[17:01.620 --> 17:07.300]  A story and and a strategy for the next few months. Yeah, and and they really
[17:07.300 --> 17:12.420]  They've always been a company of habits and you know
[17:13.620 --> 17:18.420]  that there's an annual calendar to apple and following apple and
[17:18.980 --> 17:24.580]  It I guess it's never set in stone and never assumed that anything is permanent. Um,
[17:26.260 --> 17:33.060]  You know, but I I do feel though that internally they they clearly feel it's a good idea
[17:33.060 --> 17:38.740]  Clearly feel it's a good idea and you know, I think some of us on the outside
[17:39.300 --> 17:43.700]  Talking about software quality which we can get into as the podcast as the show goes on
[17:44.420 --> 17:48.020]  Might disagree with with this to some degree that it's good
[17:48.500 --> 17:51.860]  But that the annual schedule they have the os's on
[17:52.580 --> 17:56.420]  Is clearly a deliberate strategy on their part. I mean they they
[17:56.420 --> 18:02.260]  Almost come out and say it they very seldom, you know at the executive level like to explain
[18:02.660 --> 18:08.340]  Their thinking they're secretive about why they do what they do. They're just like, you know, here's what we have
[18:08.340 --> 18:10.340]  Here's what we're going to do
[18:10.340 --> 18:14.500]  Well, why why do you like why do you tell us everything that's coming for the next year at wwdc?
[18:14.500 --> 18:20.260]  They don't want to tell you but they clearly, you know, it's so many years in a row where they've been doing it this way
[18:20.260 --> 18:26.660]  And ios has always been on this annual schedule I ever since the original iphone came out there have been
[18:27.460 --> 18:28.980]  major new
[18:28.980 --> 18:34.980]  integer dot o releases of ios, you know, even before ios had a name and
[18:35.540 --> 18:41.140]  You know now that ios and ipad os are two different names. They're still on the same schedule and
[18:42.180 --> 18:44.180]  You know tv os
[18:44.180 --> 18:48.340]  Which is built on ios has the same fundamental version number. It's tv os
[18:48.340 --> 18:50.340]  13.0
[18:50.340 --> 18:54.660]  Uh watch os has been on it has been on the same annual schedule mac os
[18:54.660 --> 18:59.860]  Which in the early years of ios was not on an annual schedule anymore and you know
[19:00.500 --> 19:05.860]  Is now and I feel like it's all very strategic. I think apple thinks it keeps them honest
[19:05.860 --> 19:09.380]  I feel like they feel like this is a way that they can
[19:10.580 --> 19:14.420]  You know and at some level that you know, it's undeniable, you know, we can quibble about
[19:14.420 --> 19:20.900]  Whether they push too fast and do new features faster than they fix bugs et cetera
[19:20.900 --> 19:25.300]  but at some level it obviously keeps them from falling into
[19:26.260 --> 19:28.660]  The trap that I think microsoft fell into
[19:29.540 --> 19:37.220]  Over a decade ago with windows 7, right? I mean, that's that's that's the thing that I think they want to avoid where
[19:38.020 --> 19:40.020]  post
[19:40.020 --> 19:45.620]  What was it windows nt? What was the windows 2000 right windows 2000 came out
[19:46.340 --> 19:51.620]  And was a huge hit. It was probably peak windows in terms of popularity and
[19:52.660 --> 19:54.660]  industry dominance
[19:54.900 --> 19:59.060]  and they came up with the what's next after windows 2000 and they had
[20:00.420 --> 20:02.820]  Sort of a boil the ocean plan with all these
[20:03.540 --> 20:07.460]  You know, they wanted to do so much in the next version and all of a sudden, you know
[20:07.460 --> 20:12.500]  Five six years go by you know, and they hadn't come out with the successor, right?
[20:12.900 --> 20:18.500]  That's what you want to avoid. You don't want to try to bite too much off and these and this annual schedule
[20:19.140 --> 20:24.100]  Kind of keeps everything down to we're gonna keep making incremental progress every year
[20:24.740 --> 20:29.940]  And I think they like it and I think announcing it at wwdc is very strategic
[20:30.660 --> 20:32.660]  yeah, yeah, and also like
[20:32.660 --> 20:40.180]  Unlike other companies like this all these android manufacturers apple controls both the software and the hardware and because of that
[20:40.820 --> 20:46.260]  they can tie the new version of ios to a new iphone right and and only
[20:47.220 --> 20:52.420]  You know apple is one of the very few companies that can do this and and the reason why there's an annual version of ios
[20:52.420 --> 20:54.820]  It's because usually the new iphone also has some
[20:55.460 --> 20:58.500]  hardware feature that is enabled via software and so
[20:58.500 --> 21:06.020]  hardware feature that is enabled via software and so what this virus does though, it's such a new situation because
[21:06.740 --> 21:14.660]  Supply chains are going to be constrained and we're starting to hear all these rumors about all kinds of devices being delayed from
[21:14.980 --> 21:21.220]  Smaller companies like you know bridge. They make the bridge keyboard. They're having issues with their
[21:22.580 --> 21:24.580]  They did a trackpad
[21:24.580 --> 21:32.820]  enabled keyboard which it's kind of funny because we're going to talk about that in a few but that's being delayed and we're hearing that like
[21:33.540 --> 21:41.480]  Sony and microsoft they are preparing the the playstation 5 and the new xbox and now they're also facing issues with the coronavirus
[21:42.100 --> 21:44.100]  So what's going to happen to the iphone?
[21:44.820 --> 21:49.220]  It's it's such an it's something that in my lifetime. I've never
[21:49.220 --> 21:54.100]  Seen anything like this, uh in terms of like a stop to the global economy
[21:54.660 --> 21:59.540]  And yeah, like what does it mean in the in the in the world of apple in terms of?
[22:00.020 --> 22:04.180]  Will there be a new iphone in september and if so, there must be a new version of ios
[22:05.060 --> 22:07.060]  My and I you know, obviously
[22:07.940 --> 22:14.340]  It's one of those things where maybe you know, here's a situation where having tim cook as the ceo of the company is
[22:15.460 --> 22:17.460]  Ideal right like who better
[22:17.460 --> 22:21.540]  It because ultimately it's an operations problem, right? This is
[22:22.420 --> 22:27.220]  Literally operations 101 to have a supply chain disruption
[22:27.940 --> 22:35.300]  This significant and so, you know, it's not like somebody has to come in and explain how the supply chain works to tim cook
[22:35.860 --> 22:38.580]  right, like, you know, it
[22:39.860 --> 22:43.700]  It it you know, you literally could not ask for a better ceo
[22:43.700 --> 22:49.780]  For a crisis like this if it is indeed a crisis, but what and I am not an expert on the supply chain
[22:49.780 --> 22:52.900]  and and the details of the supply chain are
[22:53.620 --> 22:59.780]  Like much at apple a uh, you know, it's like the recipe to coca-cola. It is a very tightly held secret
[22:59.780 --> 23:04.020]  They don't talk about how they're up, you know, they don't talk about how?
[23:04.820 --> 23:08.020]  The supply chain works in detail. It's
[23:08.580 --> 23:11.140]  You know, it's effectively a black box
[23:11.140 --> 23:14.660]  You know, it's effectively a black box in a lot of ways
[23:15.460 --> 23:16.420]  um
[23:16.420 --> 23:19.620]  But one thing reading up on this in in hey
[23:19.700 --> 23:24.580]  How big a deal is this coronavirus in terms of the supply chain and and is the sort of thing that could?
[23:25.460 --> 23:30.100]  You know disrupt apple's obvious plans to have brand new iphones in september
[23:30.820 --> 23:31.700]  um
[23:31.700 --> 23:34.340]  and this makes I think this makes common sense is that
[23:35.380 --> 23:37.780]  Let's say it's a two or three week shutdown, you know
[23:37.780 --> 23:41.140]  And they shut down certain factories and suppliers for two to three weeks
[23:41.460 --> 23:42.980]  Tell everybody to stay home
[23:42.980 --> 23:49.380]  Don't leave your house and then two or three weeks go by and they open back up in china and they're there that doesn't mean
[23:50.420 --> 23:54.900]  That everything that would have happened is just pushed back two or three weeks, right?
[23:55.060 --> 23:59.000]  It's it's like a ripple effect right like a two or three week disruption
[23:59.700 --> 24:01.700]  Could have a months-long
[24:01.840 --> 24:03.840]  disruption in supply
[24:04.020 --> 24:06.020]  because it
[24:06.020 --> 24:08.020]  it it's just that
[24:08.480 --> 24:14.660]  Complicated and there's so many cogs that having you know, one or two cogs stop for a bit
[24:15.140 --> 24:17.380]  Shuts the whole machine down
[24:17.940 --> 24:20.100]  For a while and then has to start back up
[24:20.820 --> 24:21.940]  um
[24:21.940 --> 24:25.700]  And the other thing too you have to keep in mind is like oh well
[24:26.420 --> 24:29.700]  95 of suppliers are back up and running at full steam
[24:29.700 --> 24:37.460]  Um, but what about the five percent that aren't right? Like what if they're not what if the components that those suppliers provide?
[24:38.420 --> 24:39.760]  aren't
[24:39.760 --> 24:44.580]  Obtainable from alternative suppliers or aren't obtainable in sufficient
[24:45.200 --> 24:49.540]  Quantity from other suppliers, right? Like it could be one tiny little screw
[24:49.620 --> 24:54.980]  But if it only comes from one factory, you cannot make the iphone or you have to redesign around it, right?
[24:55.060 --> 24:57.780]  I mean a screw is probably a bad example, but
[24:57.780 --> 24:59.380]  You know
[24:59.380 --> 25:06.260]  It who knows, you know, which how many components from the iphone have some sufficient alternatives to defend against this
[25:06.900 --> 25:10.500]  Yeah, yeah, and in the short term not to mention there's
[25:11.060 --> 25:17.060]  Rumors of a spring event and now that's an even more problematic one because all these all these
[25:19.140 --> 25:21.140]  Issues are happening now like
[25:21.540 --> 25:27.060]  Countries that are saying like, you know, italy and france for example are saying it's probably best if you don't try it
[25:27.060 --> 25:28.580]  If you don't travel right now
[25:28.580 --> 25:34.900]  So what does that mean for any kind of european media that may be invited to an apple event, right? So I
[25:35.780 --> 25:39.700]  I don't know. Do you I mean it's it's do you have any idea before we leave the subject?
[25:39.700 --> 25:41.700]  But I mean what it is
[25:41.780 --> 25:47.620]  I think it's just a fluke but I mean, you know, italy is certainly has a you know, world-class health care system and
[25:48.500 --> 25:50.500]  It just seems it just seems so
[25:50.960 --> 25:53.300]  Anomalous that italy of all countries
[25:53.300 --> 25:57.140]  Has this, you know, 600 person outbreak. I
[25:58.100 --> 26:02.500]  My guess is it's just a fluke and that's just the way things like this go right like
[26:03.220 --> 26:08.260]  Somebody shows up with it and it starts to spread and boom, you know, 600 people have it
[26:08.980 --> 26:10.980]  Yeah, so what they're saying is that um
[26:12.820 --> 26:14.820]  It went unnoticed
[26:15.140 --> 26:20.900]  For 10 days right and in those 10 days is it spread to a lot of people?
[26:20.900 --> 26:27.540]  um, now I actually think that the government actually did a very good job in terms of okay now we need to shut down
[26:27.860 --> 26:35.400]  At least two major areas in northern italy and they did that and they closed offices and schools and public transportation
[26:36.020 --> 26:42.420]  Uh, and it's you know, like right now we're asking those people who live like near milan and near uh venice
[26:42.420 --> 26:48.020]  For example, we're asking them a lot like stay it stay inside and don't leave the house for two weeks
[26:48.020 --> 26:51.060]  But I also think that it's uh
[26:52.500 --> 26:54.500]  It's it's a like it's a
[26:54.980 --> 26:59.540]  mindset problem in the sense that we italians we tend to
[27:00.340 --> 27:02.900]  Take these kinds of things way too lightly
[27:03.460 --> 27:07.460]  We and and like right now there's a whole debate going on
[27:08.180 --> 27:14.580]  Whether the government is actually doing too much because it's just the flu like a lot of people are saying that oh, it's just a flu
[27:14.580 --> 27:19.060]  Whatever. Um, and and I think that's something that we italians do all the time
[27:19.060 --> 27:26.020]  Like we we don't necessarily give as much importance to things that the government says actually look this is important
[27:26.020 --> 27:28.740]  You should care about it. And so i'm seeing a lot of people
[27:29.700 --> 27:33.220]  Simply say well, whatever. It's just a cold. It's just a flu. I don't care
[27:33.780 --> 27:39.300]  It's not a problem. And so I think a lot of people do not go get tested because of that
[27:39.540 --> 27:42.020]  And for that reason it's spreading even more quickly
[27:42.020 --> 27:44.020]  so, um
[27:44.100 --> 27:51.220]  The health the healthcare system here is actually very good. Yeah. Yeah, but one of the things I read was that you have to
[27:51.220 --> 27:56.740]  You have to understand that one of the things we might see is we might see higher
[27:57.380 --> 27:58.980]  rates of
[27:58.980 --> 28:05.780]  infection reported in countries with better health care systems right because they have the better health care system and people will go to the
[28:05.780 --> 28:13.940]  doctor and get identified and that the the danger is that in the countries where where the health care system isn't as good and people
[28:13.940 --> 28:15.060]  You know
[28:15.060 --> 28:17.300]  Don't have access to quality health insurance
[28:17.700 --> 28:23.700]  It might be spreading faster than the numbers that are reported because the people who have it aren't going to the doctor where it can
[28:23.700 --> 28:26.980]  Be reported, you know, yeah because here like it's totally free
[28:26.980 --> 28:31.060]  I believe it's like one euro if you want to get the the coronavirus test
[28:31.060 --> 28:37.380]  And in general like be being treated here is entirely for free for any kind of problem that you may have
[28:37.780 --> 28:43.140]  And I cannot possibly imagine what that's like in the united states. I mean every time I travel for
[28:43.680 --> 28:49.780]  WWDC I have to get special insurance to travel to america because if something happens to me
[28:50.340 --> 28:52.660]  I need to pay for travel insurance that
[28:53.780 --> 28:58.660]  Insures that I will be covered if anything happens and that's such a problem
[28:58.660 --> 29:02.820]  I need to pay for travel insurance that I will be covered if anything happens and that's such a foreign concept to me because
[29:03.460 --> 29:08.100]  Here more or less they won't they will not let you die and they will not
[29:08.660 --> 29:13.140]  Ask you for money, right? No, and I know that it's true even for you know, people who are
[29:13.680 --> 29:18.260]  Vacationing there and something, you know, I have friends, you know from america and they're like blown away
[29:18.260 --> 29:25.060]  Like they took a fall and sprained their ankle and went to the hospital and you know in london or probably like rome
[29:25.060 --> 29:29.860]  And you know and it's like oh they go and then they they take like a couple of bucks and they you know
[29:30.980 --> 29:34.340]  Did you add you up and you're like you're like, where are you going to send the bill on there?
[29:34.340 --> 29:36.340]  Like there is no bill and you're like what?
[29:36.580 --> 29:42.340]  No, it is. No, I do worry though. And all the politics of us health care aside, which we certainly can't get into
[29:42.900 --> 29:43.940]  you know
[29:43.940 --> 29:48.340]  this sort of uh epidemic type type thing really puts a
[29:49.140 --> 29:52.500]  Bullseye on what's wrong with the system that allows
[29:52.500 --> 29:57.780]  Literally millions of people to not have insurance at all and therefore to weigh every single
[29:58.100 --> 30:03.140]  Calculation as of whether they should go to the doctor or not with hmm. What's it going to cost me?
[30:04.660 --> 30:10.020]  You know, this is the sort of thing where anybody who suspects that they have it really really ought to go to the doctor
[30:10.020 --> 30:14.500]  Not just for their own benefit, but for the benefit of of everybody, right, you know
[30:15.460 --> 30:20.420]  So anyway, I don't know uh, I I am like I said, I would put the odds at around
[30:20.420 --> 30:22.420]  30 or 40 percent at this point that
[30:22.660 --> 30:24.660]  WWDC is not going to happen
[30:25.300 --> 30:31.860]  because I think and you know the facebook news coming out today for a may developer conference shows
[30:32.580 --> 30:38.420]  How far in advance a company wants to make a decision like that, you know and in some ways you know what I mean?
[30:38.420 --> 30:44.180]  And it's like what if they what if facebook cancelled this thing and may comes around and the whole thing is is blown over?
[30:44.180 --> 30:45.780]  It's gone. It's you know
[30:45.780 --> 30:50.740]  I I don't think that means that anybody should be upset. I I think it calls for caution
[30:51.620 --> 30:53.620]  So let's say two or three weeks from now
[30:54.660 --> 30:59.380]  Or you know by sometime by the end of march apple says, you know what we're you know, because of this
[30:59.380 --> 31:04.740]  We're not going to have WWDC this year and then june 8th rolls around and there's nothing
[31:05.700 --> 31:07.940]  i'm sure some people are going to complain but
[31:09.220 --> 31:14.260]  You know, you can't expect somebody in march to have a hundred percent certainty as well
[31:14.260 --> 31:17.860]  Where it's going to be in june, you know, you have to you have to do what?
[31:18.500 --> 31:19.940]  seems
[31:19.940 --> 31:20.980]  responsible
[31:20.980 --> 31:22.980]  Which doesn't mean?
[31:23.140 --> 31:25.860]  somehow magically foreseeing the future
[31:27.700 --> 31:33.700]  You know, it's a you know, and in a shorter term, I mean it months in advance is very hard to to to
[31:34.500 --> 31:36.740]  to anticipate but like
[31:37.860 --> 31:42.100]  Here in the us it's always the case like we on the east coast of the u.s
[31:42.100 --> 31:47.300]  Especially in the south like where I live. It's seldom an issue, but there was one a couple years ago
[31:47.300 --> 31:51.140]  But we have hurricanes and then these hurricanes come and days in advance
[31:51.140 --> 31:54.180]  They make a determination as to whether people on the coast
[31:54.740 --> 32:00.740]  Should should evacuate or not and then at some point they often make it a mandatory evacuation where?
[32:01.220 --> 32:03.700]  I mean they don't arrest you if you don't leave but you know
[32:03.700 --> 32:10.260]  It's they're officially saying everybody must leave and that you know that if the police see you that and you're not leaving
[32:10.260 --> 32:16.100]  They you know, try to encourage you to get the hell out but then every once in a while the storm comes in
[32:16.100 --> 32:20.740]  It's not so bad and then people are like well, why the hell did you have us evacuate and it's like you can't
[32:21.380 --> 32:23.700]  You can't only tell people to evacuate
[32:24.020 --> 32:29.220]  When you're a hundred percent certain they need to evacuate because you're only a hundred percent certain when you know
[32:29.380 --> 32:33.380]  The 120 mile hour winds are blowing the roof off your house, you know, yeah
[32:34.180 --> 32:38.900]  Yeah, and like these events you they are planned several times
[32:38.900 --> 32:43.780]  Planned several months in advance, right? It's not like you can say oh, let's wait until
[32:44.420 --> 32:48.500]  The middle of may right, uh, and then we can announce wwc
[32:48.580 --> 32:53.780]  It's doesn't work like that. And I think a lot of people actually think that it does but it's not like that
[32:53.860 --> 32:55.860]  you need several months of planning for
[32:56.580 --> 33:03.300]  You know all I mean you we mentioned um engineers preparing their sessions. That's one example. It takes months of work
[33:03.300 --> 33:10.180]  well, I like I said, I think either way that will still happen on the same schedule and I think that
[33:10.820 --> 33:12.840]  Whether they have full wwdc
[33:13.700 --> 33:20.500]  Whether they cancel it and do it online only and hold a press event or whether even a press event isn't deemed
[33:21.060 --> 33:24.580]  Safe and they maybe they would do a keynote that's online. I don't know
[33:24.740 --> 33:27.380]  I mean that would be weird to not have anybody in the audience, but
[33:27.380 --> 33:34.500]  Although I guess they'd still still have their own apple employees. And so you'd still hear all the applause. So maybe the retail employees, right?
[33:34.740 --> 33:36.580]  They could they could fill it up with some people
[33:38.900 --> 33:41.640]  But I still feel like they will do the annual
[33:42.580 --> 33:46.340]  This is the state of our os's and our road map for
[33:47.860 --> 33:49.620]  2021
[33:49.620 --> 33:52.580]  You know fall of 2020 into 2021
[33:52.580 --> 33:56.900]  2021 uh, here you go. I feel like that'll happen either way
[33:57.060 --> 34:01.780]  it's just a question of whether you want to have five invite five thousand developers from around the world into
[34:02.740 --> 34:04.100]  beautiful
[34:04.100 --> 34:06.100]  hospitable san jose
[34:07.380 --> 34:09.380]  Beautiful especially beautiful
[34:10.020 --> 34:16.740]  I don't I don't even remember I drink coffee every day and now i'm trying to remember where the hell do I get it?
[34:17.540 --> 34:21.860]  I don't even remember I honest to god. I can't even I was there for four days last week
[34:21.860 --> 34:25.140]  And I don't remember where I got coffee. I think it's like my mind
[34:26.100 --> 34:28.100]  was so scarred by the experience it like
[34:28.900 --> 34:31.540]  It was like traumatic and i've i've forgotten the memory
[34:32.740 --> 34:37.620]  Yeah, I i'm pretty sure that one time last year mark horman, uh walked us to uh
[34:38.420 --> 34:41.220]  some kind of breakfast place that took like
[34:42.100 --> 34:49.140]  20 minutes to get to and they didn't have coffee. Well, it's so that sounds it for you social policy
[34:49.140 --> 34:56.820]  Which I do miss but social policy didn't take 20 minutes to get to but it did take 20 or 30 minutes to get like a sandwich
[34:58.820 --> 35:03.540]  My wife goes and you know, my wife got a hamburger and and it took 45 minutes
[35:04.980 --> 35:06.980]  To get a hamburger
[35:07.460 --> 35:10.500]  That place I mean it's like shocker that that place closed
[35:12.740 --> 35:17.300]  But it's too bad because they actually had decent espresso and croissants sometimes
[35:17.300 --> 35:22.660]  Yeah, it was good food. It just it just clearly wasn't meant for they were
[35:23.940 --> 35:28.260]  So unprepared for more people than usual, right?
[35:28.260 --> 35:33.780]  But I don't even know if it is more people than usual. I think the san jose convention center often holds
[35:34.260 --> 35:37.240]  Conventions that are far larger than wwdc
[35:37.940 --> 35:42.100]  and it's it that's the thing about san jose that just boggles the mind is that
[35:42.100 --> 35:49.300]  Is that it it feels in terms of the restaurant hours the coffee shop service the the
[35:49.620 --> 35:51.780]  the early closing of the bars
[35:52.820 --> 36:00.340]  Everything makes it feel as though it is this sleepy little town where nothing big ever happens and apple just picked it
[36:00.580 --> 36:05.380]  And puts up a five thousand person tent like the circus once a year
[36:06.180 --> 36:09.940]  And it comes out of nowhere and nobody in town was aware of it
[36:09.940 --> 36:12.500]  And even though now they've had it there what three years
[36:13.460 --> 36:17.380]  It's like nobody remembers that in june, you know, there's a busy week
[36:17.620 --> 36:23.620]  But it's worse than that because they have conventions throughout the year. It is it is a very large convention center
[36:23.700 --> 36:27.000]  I don't I suppose in terms when you add up all of moscone
[36:28.100 --> 36:29.940]  north
[36:29.940 --> 36:31.940]  south and
[36:32.020 --> 36:38.660]  West or whatever the hell the the three three parts of it are I guess moscone is bigger overall
[36:38.660 --> 36:44.340]  I mean it's so you can't eyeball it because so much of moscone is underground but apple never you know for
[36:44.720 --> 36:48.980]  wwdc never took the the the two main buildings they only use the
[36:50.020 --> 36:56.100]  You know the one that actually is glass and upstairs it I think it's bigger than than the old where apple used to hold
[36:56.880 --> 37:02.820]  Wwdc and there's so there's got to be big conventions throughout the year. It's like just it's a convention area
[37:02.820 --> 37:10.100]  It's a convention area of town that is not ready for any conventions of any sort whatsoever. It boggles the mind
[37:10.820 --> 37:13.620]  Maybe they just don't like other people coming in. It's just
[37:15.860 --> 37:19.060]  Everybody and everybody it feels like it's everybody's first day on the job
[37:20.580 --> 37:26.180]  and to be fair, it's it's it saddens me because every san jose local that i've met they're like
[37:26.180 --> 37:33.140]  Super lovely and kind people. It's just the store owners that don't know how to deal with that. So I don't know
[37:36.020 --> 37:42.660]  I was there with somebody once they were trying to close a bar and my friend luke asked asked the manager. Do you like to make money?
[37:43.620 --> 37:44.980]  And the guy
[37:44.980 --> 37:46.980]  Yes, exactly. That's the problem
[37:47.380 --> 37:49.140]  Oh my god
[37:49.140 --> 37:52.100]  Anyway, all right. Let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor. It is

[39:44.340 --> 39:46.900]  All right, so while we're talking about apple events
[39:47.540 --> 39:53.940]  There are rumors of a spring event, which I would guess would take place
[39:54.660 --> 39:56.740]  At the end of march and the reason
[39:57.620 --> 40:00.980]  That I guess that I keep track of this. Let me open up my note here
[40:02.500 --> 40:04.500]  Is like I said apple is a
[40:04.500 --> 40:10.740]  A company of habits and patterns and they might decide to stop following something
[40:11.300 --> 40:13.300]  but that would be like a major decision and
[40:14.580 --> 40:20.420]  Uh, they do not hold a march event every year, but they did hold
[40:21.380 --> 40:23.380]  a march event in
[40:24.320 --> 40:25.860]  2016
[40:25.860 --> 40:27.860]  That was at town hall in cupertino
[40:27.860 --> 40:34.580]  Uh, they did a new ipad a smaller iphone. That was the uh, the iphone se's debut
[40:35.300 --> 40:40.500]  And the 9.7 inch ipad pro which I think was the first small ipad pro
[40:41.300 --> 40:45.080]  They did not have one in 2017 in march, but then in 2018
[40:46.020 --> 40:49.720]  They had a special event, uh, march 27th
[40:51.300 --> 40:54.340]  At lane tech high school in chicago. Were you there for that one?
[40:54.340 --> 41:01.060]  Were you do you go to chicago? I was not I was not well that was uh another that was a new 9.7 inch ipad pro
[41:01.300 --> 41:08.020]  Or no just an ipad. That's right. It was the first ipad with pencil support right and and they introduced the logitech crayon
[41:08.100 --> 41:12.020]  And of course the reason it was a regular ipad not ipad pro and it was held at a school
[41:12.660 --> 41:19.320]  Was that their pitch was that this is for the education market where the price of the device is very sensitive. Anyway, 2017
[41:20.020 --> 41:22.020]  No march event
[41:22.020 --> 41:25.000]  2018 they had an event
[41:25.560 --> 41:27.560]  uh
[41:27.560 --> 41:33.000]  Or I did 2018 so 16 18 now we're in 2020. It's an even year
[41:33.640 --> 41:37.640]  Uh, so if the pattern holds and even numbered years
[41:37.800 --> 41:42.680]  They hold march events that are often feature new ipad hardware
[41:44.120 --> 41:49.560]  Will they do it again? I don't know but there's been rampant. I'll give you i'll give you another timeline
[41:49.560 --> 41:54.120]  In john, uh, I have a list. I remember I had this list somewhere. Um
[41:54.740 --> 41:56.740]  wwc announcement dates
[41:57.640 --> 42:04.140]  We forget uh for context because we were talking about this, uh last year march 14
[42:05.640 --> 42:07.640]  2018 march 13
[42:08.420 --> 42:13.160]  2017 february 16 and I believe this was early because of the san jose switch
[42:14.600 --> 42:17.560]  So if they do announce wwc must be
[42:17.560 --> 42:23.640]  Within the next couple of weeks at this point. I think they've had some that went as long as april though. I'm pretty sure
[42:24.280 --> 42:29.880]  Uh, they used to be up until 2016 april 18 2015 april 14
[42:30.280 --> 42:36.440]  Yeah, so maybe if you know, I wouldn't be surprised if we get into april and they haven't said anything
[42:36.520 --> 42:38.520]  I would interpret that as meaning
[42:38.920 --> 42:40.920]  They're still
[42:40.840 --> 42:46.760]  Like holding their breath on this coronavirus thing and waiting until the last minute to make a decision. Yeah
[42:46.760 --> 42:53.400]  Uh, but anyway the the the march event, uh, what I do know is that it tends to be at least the past couple of years
[42:53.960 --> 42:55.400]  in the
[42:55.400 --> 42:57.560]  spring break, uh week
[42:58.360 --> 43:01.480]  Is it's called spring break in the year? I think it's called spring break
[43:01.640 --> 43:06.120]  Yeah, but we are the spring break schools have spring break in widely varying
[43:07.560 --> 43:10.680]  Weeks of the year, you know some schools try to time it with easter
[43:11.240 --> 43:15.800]  Other schools have it, you know the same, you know, like the last week of march every year or something like that
[43:15.800 --> 43:22.040]  It's not there's no one universal spring break week. It's spread out in late march through april
[43:25.320 --> 43:27.320]  But will they do an event now
[43:27.320 --> 43:34.360]  Is that that's I don't know. I really don't I really don't know and you know, one of the changes they've made in recent years
[43:35.000 --> 43:35.960]  is
[43:35.960 --> 43:37.400]  that
[43:37.400 --> 43:39.800]  For many years they would hold
[43:40.600 --> 43:42.600]  satellite events
[43:42.600 --> 43:43.800]  in
[43:43.800 --> 43:48.200]  you somewhere in europe and somewhere in asia and
[43:49.560 --> 43:52.120]  This dates back to even before they had
[43:52.820 --> 43:57.560]  Reliable consistent live streams for everybody to watch right?
[43:57.640 --> 44:03.240]  I mean, it's it's easy to forget because nowadays they're they're they're they seem rock solid every single event
[44:04.040 --> 44:05.320]  um
[44:05.320 --> 44:07.000]  but for years
[44:07.000 --> 44:08.600]  They would you know
[44:08.600 --> 44:14.280]  We we if you weren't attending the event, you know, i'm sure you remember this. Well, it would be like
[44:14.360 --> 44:15.720]  Is there going to be a live stream?
[44:15.720 --> 44:19.320]  I don't know and apple wouldn't say and then sometimes like an hour before the event
[44:19.400 --> 44:21.400]  They would be like here's a url for the live stream
[44:21.960 --> 44:23.960]  Is is it going to stay up?
[44:24.840 --> 44:29.800]  Hold your breath and it was weird because sometimes it would sometimes it wouldn't it was you know
[44:30.200 --> 44:32.200]  It wasn't something you would want to bet on
[44:32.200 --> 44:38.360]  Whether they were even going to try and if they did try whether it was going to stay up was a crapshoot. Um,
[44:39.720 --> 44:47.480]  Nowadays, that's not an issue. Um, but back in that era they would hold satellite events for the media in asia and europe
[44:47.560 --> 44:49.080]  so that you know
[44:49.080 --> 44:53.240]  like european journalists could just go to london and there would be like, uh,
[44:53.880 --> 44:56.680]  You know wasn't something that maybe was public but it was you know
[44:56.680 --> 45:00.440]  Some kind of technology where they could stream it just to one facility
[45:00.440 --> 45:02.040]  in london
[45:02.040 --> 45:04.680]  And people wouldn't have to travel the extra, you know
[45:05.640 --> 45:09.640]  The eight time zones to get all the way to california or something like that. Yeah, but
[45:10.360 --> 45:15.480]  At some point a handful of years ago. They stopped that and if you're going to
[45:16.120 --> 45:19.640]  Be press credentialed for an event. You need to be at the event
[45:20.440 --> 45:25.400]  And you know, otherwise you're just watching, you know, which isn't bad. I mean I had uh, I missed an event. Uh,
[45:25.400 --> 45:27.400]  Uh
[45:29.240 --> 45:35.320]  I missed the iphone event this year because I couldn't couldn't fly because of eye surgery that I had in the end of august
[45:35.320 --> 45:40.280]  So I didn't go to the iphone event september and just watched it live, you know on my apple tv
[45:41.080 --> 45:42.840]  uh
[45:42.840 --> 45:45.000]  But there's no more satellite events like that so
[45:45.560 --> 45:51.320]  Asian media all fly to california. I mean, I guess they could not I I don't know
[45:51.400 --> 45:55.080]  I just can't imagine that they wouldn't not invite them just because they're from asia or something
[45:55.080 --> 45:56.600]  And it's not really
[45:56.600 --> 45:58.680]  that's obviously ground zero for this but you know
[45:59.480 --> 46:01.000]  As we just talked about
[46:01.000 --> 46:04.840]  15 minutes ago. It's you know, it's it's in italy. It's in california. It's
[46:05.480 --> 46:07.480]  You know, it's all around the world
[46:07.720 --> 46:11.960]  But maybe there doesn't have to be an event right because if you look at last year, right?
[46:12.440 --> 46:17.560]  It was a similar situation like a bunch of different products. We had the new air pods and we had
[46:18.200 --> 46:20.200]  Was there a new ipad last year?
[46:20.200 --> 46:26.200]  Maybe it was the ipad air 2 I believe so a bunch of different products and instead of doing an event and throwing a
[46:26.760 --> 46:31.480]  Few different products together, right? They just did the week of press releases, right?
[46:32.360 --> 46:34.920]  the team cook tweets the team cook photo
[46:36.440 --> 46:41.640]  And I think maybe there's an opportunity to do a repeat of that because if you look at the products that we're talking about now
[46:42.120 --> 46:47.560]  We're looking at an ipad pro that if you were to follow the rumors has a new camera system
[46:47.560 --> 46:53.320]  But the new design basically the same design of the existing ipad pro and maybe a new smart keyboard
[46:53.720 --> 46:57.720]  And then we're looking at the iphone 9 or sc2
[46:58.520 --> 47:00.520]  and potentially the
[47:00.600 --> 47:03.080]  New macbook pros with the new keyboards. So
[47:04.280 --> 47:06.280]  and maybe the new
[47:06.360 --> 47:12.520]  Overhear headphones that were rumored a while back. So not necessarily products that
[47:12.520 --> 47:16.920]  Tell a cohesive story like yes, they are updates
[47:17.720 --> 47:22.360]  New products even if you look at the over-ear headphones, for example in the iphone 9
[47:22.920 --> 47:28.360]  But maybe it's not necessary to throw an event just to group those products together
[47:29.480 --> 47:30.920]  Right. They don't
[47:30.920 --> 47:34.600]  You know, I i've had this discussion. I think it was with regard
[47:35.560 --> 47:40.360]  To the fact that last year or the end of 2019, you know
[47:40.360 --> 47:43.880]  Just five four or five months ago. They didn't hold the second event
[47:43.880 --> 47:49.880]  The only event they really held was the september iphone event and then in october they had um
[47:52.360 --> 47:59.880]  Small press briefings for other stuff like seeing the mac pro again before it came out
[48:00.760 --> 48:02.760]  and
[48:03.160 --> 48:09.080]  Getting hands-on time with the new 16-inch macbook pro with the miraculous
[48:09.080 --> 48:11.480]  New keyboard that actually works and clicks
[48:12.600 --> 48:19.320]  You know they had you know, I went to new york for that. I think new york was actually the main for whatever reason was
[48:20.200 --> 48:23.480]  was more media than california, but uh
[48:24.680 --> 48:30.520]  You know, I could see them doing something like that where they still want to for for invited media and people who were going to
[48:30.520 --> 48:35.080]  Review the hardware they still want to meet them and brief them and give them their take on it
[48:35.080 --> 48:39.240]  But it doesn't have to be a 500 person event in a theater. Um
[48:39.960 --> 48:46.520]  And the the the thing that I don't think a lot of people get I think I think people who don't pay close attention
[48:46.520 --> 48:51.240]  Are under the assumption that apple holds these events willy-nilly, you know
[48:51.240 --> 48:57.000]  And every time they do, you know, because why wouldn't you if you can get all this attention every time you hold a big media event
[48:57.320 --> 49:01.420]  Why wouldn't you do it all the time? But I think it's the opposite. I think apple realizes
[49:01.420 --> 49:04.960]  To the very highest levels what a tremendous
[49:06.620 --> 49:08.620]  Privilege and and
[49:09.260 --> 49:10.700]  marketing
[49:10.700 --> 49:12.540]  Hammer it is
[49:12.540 --> 49:18.300]  That when they do hold an event it garners so much attention and gets so much news
[49:18.300 --> 49:22.300]  You know and and is literally on the front page of newspapers, you know, and I know
[49:23.820 --> 49:29.340]  Newspapers printed newspapers aren't the big deal they used to be but it's still a good rule of
[49:29.340 --> 49:33.820]  just a good gauge of how big of news something is, you know, it's
[49:34.780 --> 49:41.420]  It's a pretty big deal in the grand scheme of things that when this company announces a new cell phone it's front page news
[49:41.980 --> 49:43.980]  You know around the world
[49:44.380 --> 49:48.300]  I think they realize that part, you know, there's there's the little boy who cried wolf
[49:49.180 --> 49:53.180]  Problem, right? Yeah. I mean, you know that that that yeah fairy tale, right?
[49:53.180 --> 49:57.100]  It's like, you know, if you hold events that aren't worth people's attention
[49:57.100 --> 50:02.300]  Eventually, even when you have an event that is worth their attention people aren't going to pay attention to it
[50:02.940 --> 50:08.540]  Or they're not going to pay as much as they did and I think apple at the very highest levels is very cognizant of
[50:09.100 --> 50:16.140]  Not doing that, you know and and the the 16-inch macbook pro is a perfect example of that. It is a tremendous product
[50:16.140 --> 50:18.140]  I mean i'm still using
[50:18.140 --> 50:23.420]  One right now and I love it and I really do think it is it is truly a return
[50:23.420 --> 50:27.900]  As much as it looks like and i'm not going to go off on a whole macbook pro tangent here
[50:27.900 --> 50:34.940]  We got to talk ipad but as much as it looks side by side like the 15-inch macbook pro replaced in so many ways
[50:35.580 --> 50:42.380]  It really does fix so many of the things that we all complained about with the 15-inch macbook pros for the last two or three years
[50:43.340 --> 50:49.580]  But was it worth an event and like you said is there a story to tell? Well, if the story is we fixed
[50:49.580 --> 50:56.300]  This that and the other problems they don't really want to get them on stage and say that you know, they'd rather say that privately and
[50:57.740 --> 51:01.660]  In a small room and just say yeah, you know, we have a new keyboard design
[51:02.060 --> 51:08.300]  Yeah, and and if you look at the at the previous events, there always tends to be a narrative around them like last year
[51:08.780 --> 51:13.500]  It was the services event like the the strange one with a bunch of services together
[51:13.500 --> 51:16.620]  But he told the story right and the year before he told the story
[51:16.620 --> 51:23.420]  But he told the story right and the year before that it was the education event and in october 2018
[51:23.500 --> 51:30.220]  It was the pro event. So in brooklyn, we got the ipad pro and the mac mini, I believe so there was there
[51:30.620 --> 51:36.940]  Tends to be an like an overarching narrative to an event and we've seen how
[51:37.580 --> 51:39.340]  when they have a
[51:39.340 --> 51:45.100]  Bunch of different products to release and to announce maybe the best strategy is not to throw an event but to
[51:45.100 --> 51:50.860]  Try different ways whether it's like private, uh, press briefings or youtubers or um
[51:51.340 --> 51:55.420]  Doing just the you know, the tim cook tweet and the and the announcement on the website
[51:55.900 --> 51:59.340]  Uh people last year were sure oh the the airpods pro
[51:59.740 --> 52:04.460]  Are gonna have an event for sure or the 16-inch micro pro will have an event for sure
[52:04.460 --> 52:10.300]  But no the airports pro actually only had a press release. Yeah, I believe not even not even uh,
[52:11.340 --> 52:13.340]  uh press reviews embargoed reviews
[52:13.340 --> 52:15.980]  Uh, let me think about that. I got to try them
[52:16.380 --> 52:21.740]  I did get to try them at the hands-on thing in new york. That was the same. Oh, maybe there were then
[52:22.140 --> 52:27.340]  Yeah, I think I did get a review unit then. Uh, I forget. I don't think they were embargoed though
[52:27.740 --> 52:32.940]  I think it was like you could just take them and you start right? Yeah, they definitely did that and they definitely had
[52:33.820 --> 52:35.820]  a little um
[52:35.820 --> 52:44.620]  Um, uh, like it was like a dozen of us at a time got to go up to these tables and
[52:46.620 --> 52:48.620]  They were factory sealed they reached
[52:49.180 --> 52:55.340]  you there were like little spots and you'd go up and there was a shrink wrap box of airpods pro that you could open up and
[52:56.460 --> 52:58.460]  uh, you know just
[52:58.700 --> 53:05.260]  Parity or and it was you know, it was kind of an interesting demo because unlike most apple demos where the whole thing is scripted
[53:05.260 --> 53:07.900]  You know, they have this device that's already got everything
[53:07.900 --> 53:14.140]  They want to show you including the game that shows off, you know metal and this and that they just were like here
[53:14.220 --> 53:18.640]  Take you know, here's a brand new airpods pro open them up pair them with your iphone
[53:19.100 --> 53:23.100]  To see how easy it is just to get off the ground and then listen to something on your phone, you know
[53:24.540 --> 53:27.260]  And it was funny they did this thing. It was in new york
[53:29.100 --> 53:30.300]  and
[53:30.300 --> 53:37.180]  It's it it wasn't a soundproof room, but it's you know, they don't want they don't like people talking about it, but it was quiet enough
[53:37.740 --> 53:42.380]  But they wanted to show off the noise canceling and so they said so this is ridiculous
[53:42.540 --> 53:47.900]  But we got here and realized there really isn't any street noise here. So they used a
[53:48.540 --> 53:53.340]  Home pod to play street traffic noise. Oh, wow. I swear to god
[53:54.300 --> 53:56.220]  So they were like this seems silly but you know
[53:56.220 --> 54:01.980]  It should sound you know, we want to make it sound more like you're outside on the sidewalks and they just best street traffic
[54:02.060 --> 54:06.620]  Noise you've ever heard. Yeah, they just they just played street, you know, the best street traffic noise
[54:06.700 --> 54:10.060]  You've ever heard in an air pod and then you know, they were like now just you know
[54:10.060 --> 54:13.900]  Squeeze the stem to to turn off noise turn noise canceling on etc
[54:14.860 --> 54:15.820]  um
[54:15.820 --> 54:21.020]  Yeah, I could see them doing that, you know the I think the wild card in the rumored events for this
[54:21.020 --> 54:27.820]  You know if there's a march or early april event, the wild card is ipad like the iphone 9
[54:28.300 --> 54:33.020]  Or whatever they're going to call it, but I kind of like the name iphone 9. I I yeah
[54:33.340 --> 54:36.460]  And I know people like well, why would you want to make it seem old and it's like dude
[54:36.460 --> 54:39.740]  You don't have no idea how many millions of tens of millions of people out there
[54:40.460 --> 54:47.020]  Who already have like an iphone 6 and they just want something exactly like it but brand new, you know
[54:47.020 --> 54:52.540]  You just it you just cannot underestimate that like my mom is waiting for one. My mom is like a years old iphone
[54:53.100 --> 55:00.380]  Uh the battery it's like like 82 so it's like still above that 80 threshold, but it's like, you know getting close
[55:00.940 --> 55:04.700]  and all she she like is not terrified, but she's
[55:05.580 --> 55:11.420]  The idea of switching from touch id to face id gives her anxiety. It's because she does it's unfamiliar
[55:11.500 --> 55:15.020]  She's like, well, how do you get out of an app? And I was like, yeah, you'd learn you just swipe up
[55:15.020 --> 55:17.580]  It's easy now, you know what she wants. She wants a home button
[55:17.900 --> 55:21.420]  I would say this thing is going to be a huge seller call it the iphone 9
[55:21.980 --> 55:27.500]  And yeah, anybody who knows that they're already up to 11 and we're like seven months away from you know
[55:27.580 --> 55:32.080]  And put an asterisk and a footnote here go back 20 minutes to our whole coronavirus
[55:32.460 --> 55:36.540]  Maybe it's not september, but you know, iphone 12 is probably coming in september
[55:37.100 --> 55:39.420]  Or an iphone 11s or something
[55:39.420 --> 55:45.580]  There are literally maybe hundreds of millions of people around the world who would love an iphone 9 called the iphone 9
[55:46.140 --> 55:51.100]  So but here's the thing. Is it a good demo? No, it would be the worst demo in the world
[55:51.740 --> 55:53.740]  right because
[55:53.900 --> 55:59.340]  You can't see that it's faster right because like this, you know, what are you going to do?
[55:59.340 --> 56:05.180]  You know run run a a benchmark on an iphone compared to an iphone 7 or something like that. I mean
[56:05.180 --> 56:11.660]  It's you know, it's an iphone 8 with new internals. What do you what do you demo? There is no
[56:12.620 --> 56:17.100]  The best product to show off on stage right and it would be running ios
[56:17.800 --> 56:21.040]  13.3 or maybe ios probably ios 13.4
[56:21.660 --> 56:25.980]  right because ios 13.4 is far enough in beta that it would probably be the
[56:26.700 --> 56:30.460]  The os for the out of the box for the new this new phone
[56:30.460 --> 56:34.540]  It's running the ios version that everybody around the world already is running
[56:35.420 --> 56:40.700]  Right. It's not a demo. The ipad is the thing that maybe would have a demo, right?
[56:41.580 --> 56:43.580]  and
[56:43.820 --> 56:50.300]  Are everybody's mutual friend the internet's friend steven trout and smith. It's spelunker of betas
[56:51.820 --> 56:53.820]  Has you know
[56:54.220 --> 56:59.500]  Poking around the ipad os 13.4 betas and it's running the ios 13.4
[56:59.500 --> 57:04.640]  Betas has uncovered a whole slew of keyboard related
[57:05.260 --> 57:07.260]  stuff in ios 13.4
[57:07.980 --> 57:09.980]  um
[57:09.980 --> 57:15.420]  It's all it's I don't even know you're probably more familiar with me in terms of what's already been uncovered
[57:15.500 --> 57:18.620]  But it would sort of coincide with a sort of
[57:19.340 --> 57:22.460]  Hey, you know, this is a demo like hey, you know
[57:22.620 --> 57:27.020]  People are using their ipads with a keyboard for all sorts of stuff and you know
[57:27.020 --> 57:33.660]  It fits in with the years-long narrative that for a lot of people. This is the portable that you can use in a laptop type
[57:34.460 --> 57:36.380]  setup
[57:36.380 --> 57:41.020]  So, I don't know what what what all have we already know is new in 13.4 for keyboard
[57:41.500 --> 57:44.220]  so the things that that we've seen tie in
[57:45.020 --> 57:48.540]  uh in a bunch of different ways with some potential, um
[57:49.580 --> 57:55.020]  Good demo candidates in the sense that there's one feature which is called full keyboard access
[57:55.020 --> 57:57.820]  this one was actually available for
[57:58.700 --> 58:02.780]  At least a couple beta builds last summer in 13.0
[58:03.260 --> 58:10.300]  And then it got pulled and never came back and now it's back in 13.4 and so full keyboard access lets you essentially
[58:10.940 --> 58:12.940]  define
[58:12.940 --> 58:15.020]  I believe like custom shortcuts
[58:16.300 --> 58:20.780]  That you can execute from the keyboard to perform specific functions. It's
[58:20.780 --> 58:25.980]  Essentially, it's it's another version of something that is already available in accessibility
[58:27.180 --> 58:30.620]  And that is if you connect a mouse in in ipads 13
[58:31.180 --> 58:33.900]  And you have a programmable mouse that has multiple buttons
[58:34.220 --> 58:41.260]  I mean usually two buttons, but you know, I have a logitech mouse that has five of them and you can configure each button in accessibility
[58:42.060 --> 58:46.060]  right now to do things like um, show me notification center or
[58:46.060 --> 58:51.820]  Show me notification center or um reveal the dock or go back to the home screen all that kind of stuff
[58:52.300 --> 58:59.900]  Now with full keyboard access you can do that. You can assign those system functions to keyboard commands and one of the
[59:00.540 --> 59:03.580]  Interesting features is that you can run a shortcut
[59:04.540 --> 59:05.820]  from the shortcuts up
[59:05.820 --> 59:11.900]  Uh with the system wide hotkey basically, uh, and it's not as good as on the mac
[59:11.900 --> 59:17.900]  Uh, because you cannot pass any input. So like it's not like on the mac with automator, right?
[59:17.900 --> 59:22.780]  If you have an automated workflow and you can say run this when I press command shift x
[59:23.660 --> 59:27.580]  But you can pass the selected finder item as input
[59:27.900 --> 59:33.680]  You cannot do that with full keyboard access in 13.4, but it's a step forward nonetheless
[59:34.300 --> 59:40.620]  And also the other big change is the is support for key up and down events. Yes
[59:40.620 --> 59:47.660]  Right, so that that's a one of the big features missing from developers who wanted to have like
[59:47.980 --> 59:53.660]  Serious keyboard integration with their apps. And so there's the productivity angle that I could see
[59:54.300 --> 59:59.740]  Being demoed of like now you can fully control your ipad pro in two different ways with touch
[59:59.740 --> 01:00:03.660]  Of course and with the keyboard and if you want to use the keyboard you never have to leave
[01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:07.420]  The keyboard you never have to reach the screen because you can do it all in theory
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:14.780]  Yeah, but there's also the gaming angle. Yeah, because now games can have proper keyboard integration because of key up and down events
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:17.420]  And so I could see a story
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:23.500]  Sort of like now on apple arcade you can here's a bunch of pc quality games that you can now play with the keyboard
[01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:26.060]  or with touch yeah, and if
[01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:28.940]  It it sounds so rudimentary
[01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:34.380]  Right, but just to further explain for anybody who doesn't know what key up and down events are literally
[01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:38.220]  it's it let's say you're the developer of an application and and
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:43.420]  The old days there were always apis on you know, mac windows
[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:50.220]  whatever you were on where you could say is the a key down or notify me when the a key is pressed right and is the
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:53.900]  Was it it was the key pressed or is it being pressed and held?
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:57.500]  Right, and you would think that there should be a way for computer programs
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:00:59.820]  to tell
[01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:06.620]  But ios and ipad os have not had those sort of events until 13.4, which is still in beta
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:14.060]  And so for example, and again very demoable and speaking of you know friends in san jose
[01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:17.340]  There's a small company in san jose called adobe
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:19.420]  that made
[01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:22.220]  That makes a now 30 year old app called photoshop
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:28.380]  And anybody who's ever used photoshop extensively on the desktop knows
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:34.700]  That they use the keyboard in all sorts of ways and a casual photoshop user is going to use
[01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:40.060]  every do everything with the mouse and you click on a tool and then you go over to the you know, your your
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:42.220]  Your image and you start painting
[01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:48.780]  But a photoshop export expert is using the keyboard all the time and they have single key
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:53.340]  You know switches where you can just type. Uh, I forget what all of them are honestly
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:57.420]  I haven't used them in a while, but I don't know you can just type like b for the brush or something
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:59.260]  like that
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:03.980]  People who use photoshop all the time know them by heart and then you can do things like hold down the space bar
[01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:10.860]  And the cursor turns into a hand that you can use to page around without using scroll bars or something like that
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:14.700]  And you can hold down the option key to do different, you know
[01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:20.860]  Get different behavior or the shift key to constrain a selection to a fixed. Uh
[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:27.600]  Aspect ratio as opposed to a freeform rectangle all sorts of ways that that photoshop uses the keyboard
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:30.300]  and um
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:32.380]  Has been problematic
[01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:37.980]  To say the least on ipad up until now would make for a very good demo
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:42.460]  And yeah again the gaming thing is obvious, you know in terms of being able to
[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:48.140]  Get fast key events to be able to drive a game from the keyboard
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:51.180]  Yeah, now when you think about it, not so many companies can have
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:56.860]  Can say we have a tablet that that's as a really amazing gpu
[01:02:57.580 --> 01:03:01.260]  that gives you this kind of graphical performance and lets you
[01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:07.260]  And of course if this is all true lets you play games with two different, uh input methods
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:09.820]  Uh, like you can play with touch or you can play with the keyboard
[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:16.380]  I you know not even I mean the nintendo switch has some kind of touch control, but it's not even a keyboard
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:19.820]  kind of touch control, but it's basically never used in games and
[01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:26.220]  The gpu is not nearly as good as the as the current ipad pro. I cannot I cannot imagine the next ipad pro. So
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:30.700]  It's it's definitely an interesting proposition and and from a productivity standpoint
[01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:36.220]  As you mentioned photoshop and and all the existing productivity apps, uh, there's you know
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:42.140]  There's there's a few developers who over the past couple of years have tried to enable
[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:45.740]  Full keyboard navigation in their apps in their ipad apps
[01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:53.020]  You look at something like agenda for example or things or just today the the rss client
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:59.340]  Unread as a new version unread 2 and one of the features is you can fully navigate
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:01.420]  Unread with the keyboard if you have an ipad
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:06.220]  So developers have been doing like their own custom implementations
[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:09.740]  But again, they're custom and they need they require a lot of work
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:12.940]  And they do not support key up and down events
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:18.380]  So in theory having a proper, uh framework from apple with support for key up and down events
[01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:21.820]  It makes a world of difference if you're an ipad developer, so
[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:25.100]  That's very demoble for sure. Yeah
[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:29.420]  And I think that there's
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:34.860]  It's just it's it's just the roots showing through the roots of the
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:41.180]  And it's funny because and I say this and it's like people forget it and it's come up a couple times in recent weeks
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:43.980]  But it is funny that the original
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:46.700]  ipad from 2010
[01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:51.260]  Was demoed with a first first party keyboard doc
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:05:00.140]  I had that I had that doc I used it twice and then I forgot about I you know what I knew I didn't want it
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:06.300]  You know what? I knew I didn't want it. And so I didn't buy it and I don't know how I knew it and I was like
[01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:13.420]  And and it was funny because i'll never forget that demo. Uh, it was you know, I went to the event and uh,
[01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:15.980]  The hands-on area was open
[01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:18.220]  and
[01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:24.940]  I'm always one of the often one of the last to leave because I don't i'm not under pressure to immediately get something up
[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:26.220]  on
[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:33.420]  Daring fireball I can take my time. Whereas an awful lot of the media who are in attendance either are required to
[01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:38.620]  You know file a story very quickly or just feel that pressure to you know file very quickly
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:42.140]  And nowadays, you know 2010 it wasn't as big a deal
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:45.980]  But nowadays, you know a lot of them have to shoot video and it's there's all this going on
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:48.380]  And i'll just sit there and play with the devices
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:53.020]  And I just remember it was like and they're so very nice, but they came up
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:56.380]  It was me and dan moran for it was then at mac world
[01:05:56.620 --> 01:06:01.100]  We're playing with the ipad on the dock and we were like trying to figure out all the keyboard shortcuts
[01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:06.140]  What worked and what didn't work and we're going through like mail and we're like, all right, let's go to and this was before
[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:09.760]  You know, you could hold down the command key and just see the shortcuts
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:15.660]  But we're like, oh what about shift command d? Can you do shift command d to send an email and we're like, yes, you know
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:17.260]  uh
[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:23.580]  And we're just going through and this very nice woman came over and she was like, hey, you know, hey guys, uh, you know
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.180]  We're wrapping up
[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:30.540]  And like we look around and we look around and there's literally nobody left except apple employees
[01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:33.260]  And we're like, oh, I guess we should go
[01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:37.100]  We're like, we're sorry and we're like laughing like we literally got like
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.100]  dragged out
[01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:47.500]  While we were like using the keyboard, uh doc to like try to figure out all the keyboard shortcuts that they managed to hook up. Uh,
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:54.060]  But I didn't use but anyway, the keyboard was clearly an afterthought right at least originally even though they sold a keyboard
[01:06:54.060 --> 01:07:00.300]  That's my point. They sold one originally and it was to sort of sell the line that hey, they've got like a full-blown
[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:07.020]  Full-blown version of numbers and pages and you can actually sit there and write and stuff
[01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:11.660]  But actual proper first-class support of a hardware keyboard
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:15.740]  Honestly, it's still not there and it sounds like you know
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:19.020]  We don't may not have to wait for ios or ipad os 14
[01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:24.300]  It seems like 13.4 might be the the height, you know the mark where we say
[01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:27.660]  This is where ipad os crossed the line and now uh
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:30.940]  You know has
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:35.500]  It's it's over the 50-yard line. It's over the halfway mark of having good keyboard support
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:38.140]  That's a sports metaphor, right? Yes. Yeah, i'm, sorry
[01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:46.060]  That's why I switched yards, uh, that's football. Well, that's what that's why I switched. Uh, what do you what do you call the center line?
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:48.300]  on a soccer pitch
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:50.380]  Um
[01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:55.740]  Midfield cross midfield. Yeah. Yes. All right. Yes. All right. So 50-yard line is midfield
[01:07:56.380 --> 01:08:00.940]  Uh, so we've we've crossed midfield, you know, we've gone over and now we're on the scoring end
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:06.940]  Uh, got it, you know, like for me one of the ones one of the things that is just it's just so frustrating
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:13.580]  And I don't think 13.4 does this but boy it's like man when I i'm when I have a hardware keyboard
[01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:16.700]  Connected to my ipad and I don't want to go off on the whole ipad stretch
[01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:19.900]  Here because that that'll be the closing segment of the show
[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:24.300]  We have a lot to talk about but just in terms of like driving your ipad with the keyboard
[01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:27.020]  When i'm on the home screen
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:34.620]  When i'm on the home screen, it drives me insane that you can't just use the arrow keys to select between apps
[01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:41.660]  And then hit the return key to open it or something to open it, you know, like in the finder know, you know on the mac
[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:46.300]  People might think that you hit return to open something but no return
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:52.460]  Renames it which is sort of a historical artifact. You have to use command open or command down arrow to open
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:58.140]  Uh, you know, i'm not going to argue with whether those keyboard shortcuts were a historical mistake or not
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:00.140]  But we're stuck with them, but there should be some way
[01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:08.220]  With a with a keyboard connected to an ipad to arrow key around and you know, and they enforce the grid, right?
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:13.340]  It's not like the desktop on the mac where you can kind of have your icons on your ipad home screen
[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:20.700]  strewn about you know in a mess it enforces a nice grid which is just begging
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:22.700]  For up down left right, right?
[01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.700]  Yes, yeah begging
[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:27.980]  Yeah, and really the main problem when you think about it
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:32.780]  It's is that the the ipad and that is not changing in 13.4
[01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:40.540]  It lacks any kind of selection state from the keyboard right any kind like on tvos you have the
[01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:47.740]  The focus engine right and you can select items and then you can click and there's none of that on the ipad
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:54.380]  There's none of that on the ipad, uh, which is why some developers some third-party developers have done their own custom thing
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:59.580]  But at a system level like even the basic stuff like I want to select icons on the home screen
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:05.500]  Well, it's not possible because the idea of selection is just not there just like the idea of hovering over
[01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:09.500]  Items in uik it. It's just not there. It doesn't exist which is why the
[01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:12.380]  the current implementation of the
[01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:18.060]  Pointing device is via accessibility. That's not a real pointing device. You're not hovering over anything
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:23.900]  You're just simulating a finger on screen and then you click which means you tap right but I totally agree with you
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:29.420]  Like it's so annoying that whenever you're on the home screen the really the only way to launch an app
[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:34.620]  Without touching the screen is to search for it and then press return, right?
[01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:39.180]  Which yeah sort of works, but no just let me select stuff
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:45.500]  Well, I really the other thing that drives me nuts about you do command space and then you search for an app and it is
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:52.380]  The first search result you can hit the return key and it will open but there's still no selection state to show you that
[01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:58.140]  You just kind of have to trust that the return key will open but then you can use the arrow keys to move up and down
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:02.140]  This selection, you know it, you know much like spotlight on the mac
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:07.180]  So I want to say and I may be wrong then maybe you can do command down
[01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:14.220]  To jump between different sets of results. Like maybe you can do command down and you select
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:16.780]  There still should be a selection
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:24.540]  Yeah, and it should be better than it is right now for sure. I really, what I do, I hope that in 14 we get
[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:29.660]  Some kind of selection state API and just hover state
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:34.220]  It's really necessary if you want to have serious keyboard integration
[01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:40.860]  Speaking of which did you see this, this rumor about the smart keyboard possibly getting a trackpad?
[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:45.900]  Yes, yes the the information which you know is
[01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:49.420]  Not like a regular source of Apple stuff
[01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:56.620]  You know the information is subscriber only and it's sort of like most it's largely sort of like startup focused and sort of
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:12:03.660]  VC, I often think sort of VC centric, but then when they do pipe up with Apple stuff, it's usually pretty accurate
[01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:09.980]  You know, they're you know, and they everyone, you know, they'll go months without anything and then pop up with a blockbuster and this one
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:11.980]  This is a report from Wayne Ma
[01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:15.580]  Apple planning iPad keyboard with trackpad
[01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:21.340]  Apple is planning to release an iPad keyboard accessory later this year that will include a built-in trackpad
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:25.260]  That's, you know, I don't know that we even need to go any further
[01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:30.940]  I think, you know, their article goes on and on but I feel like we all kind of, you know
[01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:34.940]  I guess the one thing we don't know and they don't know in the article is
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:37.820]  To me it
[01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:40.460]  It would imply
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:44.940]  That it's going to be promoted out of accessibility
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:48.380]  And will be promoted out of accessibility
[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:52.300]  And will become a first-class mouse cursor
[01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:58.860]  When you have a pointing device attached whether it's a trackpad on a keyboard
[01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:04.140]  Or a mouse or I guess I mean since you can connect mice you can connect
[01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:11.260]  I don't even know if this is true. Can you connect like a magic trackpad to an iPad? No, you cannot right now
[01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:17.900]  So you can't so you can plug in like a USB mouse, but you can't do a trackpad, but you know in theory
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:19.900]  They could support it, you know
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:25.740]  Theory I and I would think that then you you know and
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:31.260]  You know, oh here we go into the meat of the subject maybe I should take a break before
[01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:37.580]  Before we continue I'm gonna take a break and thank our next sponsor. It is
[01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:40.700]  Oh, I love this sponsor. This is a great company
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:43.020]  hover h-o-v-e-r
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:49.920]  Look hover is a jumping-off point for a ton of entrepreneurs
[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:56.620]  Because they want you to start your business your idea your new project. Maybe it's not even a business
[01:13:56.620 --> 01:14:03.500]  Maybe it's like an open-source project or something like that. But what do you need to start you want a great domain name hover?
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:09.820]  Has over three hundred domain name extensions to choose from when building your brand online
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:13.660]  That's the top-level domain like back in the day man. I'm so old
[01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:15.820]  I remember when there were three there was like
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:21.580]  No, four.com.org.net and.edu and if you didn't like one of those you were stuck
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:25.580]  Well, they've got over 300 of those to choose from at this point
[01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:28.860]  So no matter what you want to build there's a domain name waiting for it
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:34.540]  You'll find excellent text tech support from hover available to answer any questions you may have
[01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:40.860]  And their support team does not upsell you they only work hard to help you get online
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:45.340]  They offer stuff like free who is privacy protection?
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:52.860]  So when you register a domain name with hover keeping your personal information like your address and your phone number and your email address
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:55.580]  Etc. It's not an upsell that you have to pay for
[01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:59.740]  And your email address etc. It's not an upsell that you have to pay extra for it
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:02.540]  It's included free because of course who doesn't want
[01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:06.540]  Privacy protection on that information. They have a really clean
[01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:15.020]  Great user interface to their website and it just just the simplest thing like the search interface for searching for
[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:17.660]  Whatever it is you want.com
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:22.060]  And you find out the.com version of whatever it is you want isn't available
[01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:28.300]  But what other domains are available and what other things are similar with you you put like a hyphen in or something like that
[01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:32.940]  They offer all their their suggestion interface for what is available
[01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:37.180]  It's just perfect. It's really good. It's exactly what you want
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:43.580]  They also have monthly sales and promotions on popular top-level domains
[01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:46.620]  It's just
[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:49.580]  Once you look at hover and compare it to other domain name registrars
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:52.300]  You can just see why hover is so popular and why they've been
[01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:55.100]  so popular for so long
[01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:56.300]  I
[01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:58.300]  Love the search interface
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:00.220]  also their tech support
[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:06.780]  If you have an existing domain name registered at another registrar and you want to move it to hover
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:13.340]  They will help you as much as you need. So even if you're like a total non-expert and you don't know
[01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:16.620]  You don't want to screw up like the mx records that
[01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:22.140]  Uh deliver email and stuff like that and you just don't want to screw it up hover tech support will walk you through
[01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:25.100]  Every step of the way if you need it
[01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:32.700]  And it just to make you feel completely confident that moving your domain from your old registrar to hover is
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:35.500]  Gonna go off without a hitch. It really is great
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:37.820]  um
[01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:44.140]  It's a great interface. Like I said 300 domain name extensions to choose from grab your domain name
[01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:45.980]  and
[01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:49.340]  Just find out more by going to hover dot com slash talk show

[01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:59.360]  Make a name for yourself with hover at hover.com
[01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:00.940]  slash
[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:07.660]  Talk show. Let me see if I can remember post sponsor break where we were we were talking about the mouse cursor support
[01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:09.020]  Yeah
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:13.660]  It's got to be if they're going to do a trackpad which I think they should and I would love I really
[01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:16.940]  Really really hope that this rumor is true. Not just
[01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:25.340]  For the idea of a smart keyboard cover with a trackpad that you could use but the just the the in the broader sense
[01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:28.860]  The idea that they would add first-class mouse pointer support to ipad os
[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:35.820]  Jason snare just posted on on six colors a post with a
[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:43.500]  Post with um, uh questions about a potential smart keyboard with a trackpad and all those questions basically match the the things that I was
[01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:45.260]  thinking about um
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:52.620]  What does it mean if they do a trackpad in terms of the kind of pointer pointer that we get because right now?
[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:58.620]  I could see apple saying uh, look it's got a trackpad, but it's just for text editing, right?
[01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:00.220]  Just like now for example
[01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:05.820]  You can hold down two fingers on the software keyboard and you get a trackpad when you're editing text, right?
[01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:10.060]  I could see a scenario where yes, there's a trackpad
[01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:14.940]  but it only helps when it comes to text editing and I think that will make sense, but also
[01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:21.500]  I would be disappointed because I would love to see a full-blown trackpad support and and actual
[01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:24.540]  support in uikid for
[01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:29.900]  controlling the entire interface with the trackpad, but also what does it mean in terms of um
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:33.900]  hardware keyboard design like does it mean that apple is going to have
[01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:39.900]  A keyboard with a hinge like fully adjustable viewing angle for example, right?
[01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:43.340]  So there's a lot of questions right now, but I guess the main point being
[01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:51.580]  Do we do we foresee a scenario where the ipad you can actually control the entire ipad osui
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:56.860]  With a pointing device with the trackpad built into the keyboard so that you never have to touch the screen
[01:18:57.420 --> 01:19:00.460]  I really hope so and I for a couple of reasons one of them
[01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:08.540]  Is that it it touch screens have been around? I mean, I mean really I mean we're like 13 years into it at this point, right?
[01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:10.540]  It was uh
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:12.460]  2007
[01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:16.620]  In january when apple announced the original iphone, so
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:22.940]  We're now 13 years after we you know, not quite to the point. I mean this was the point when everybody was still speculating
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:26.460]  That it was going to be a dud. It wasn't going to work blah blah blah. We nobody had it yet
[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:32.880]  So, you know, you know, but we're easily over a 10 years into the period where people have touchscreens
[01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:41.900]  And apple has answered questions about well, why isn't doesn't the mac have touch screen support for a long time and it's you know
[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:46.460]  And it's you know until and if they ever do release touch screen max
[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:49.340]  they're going to keep answering it and their answer is
[01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:57.120]  One of the answers has always been that the ergonomics are terrible. All right, especially for like an ipad
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:02.940]  Or imac right where you're pointing at the screen an arm's length in front of you
[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:08.940]  Your arm gets tired, you know, and they've mentioned it many times but even on a laptop, you know
[01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:16.540]  It's you know a swipe here a swipe there tap here and put your hands back down. There's no problem. But if the only way
[01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:19.580]  to
[01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:24.620]  Let's say you have a text editing document a long article, you know school paper
[01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:27.500]  Someone like me or you who writes for the web
[01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:30.140]  and you've got edits to make
[01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:33.020]  And editing is often largely
[01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:38.540]  You know selecting, you know, you don't necessarily want to do it all with arrow keys, you know
[01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:40.060]  Mm-hmm
[01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:43.580]  It's tiresome to sit there and touch the screen over and over again
[01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:49.420]  And touching the screen obscures the thing you're looking at right your hand is actually in front of your face
[01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:52.380]  um
[01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:57.260]  It doesn't make sense if apple's
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:03.980]  Argument one of apple's arguments against touch screen max is the ergonomics are bad
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:09.340]  Which I believe is true. I actually think that is actually true. The ergonomics are bad, but then it doesn't make sense
[01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:11.260]  that when they say
[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:17.920]  Here with our ipad pro you can get this smart keyboard and turn it into a laptop like physical configuration
[01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:22.460]  And then when you want to do anything, you have to touch the screen which we've already told you with our other thing is
[01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:27.740]  Ergonomically bad, right? I mean that's yeah, it fundamentally doesn't make sense and when i've
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:31.580]  Confronted apple folks with that
[01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:37.660]  They you know, they just give non-answer answers, you know, but I it clearly doesn't hold water, right?
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:41.900]  And basically the ergonomic argument in favor of this
[01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:47.740]  Is beyond arguments over the operating system and the ui for it, right?
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:55.740]  But if your hands your fingers are on the home row keys of your keyboard, right? And the keyboard is flat on the desk
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:58.700]  Where are your thumbs your thumbs?
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:02.720]  Are right where trackpads go right like ergonomically
[01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:09.740]  This is a solved problem, you know, and and I know that in the early years of pc laptops, you know
[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:13.980]  the track the ibm ones had the little rubber nubbin in the middle and
[01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:21.100]  We had track balls before we had track pads, but apple quickly figured out that the right place for the track ball
[01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:26.140]  I mean there were early laptops. I don't know if you remember you're you're a youngster but there apple had one
[01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:29.660]  You know the original mac portable which was like a suitcase
[01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:35.740]  More than a laptop, but it had the trackpad the track ball off to the side, you know
[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:39.020]  So that you would use it like where a mouse was you'd move, you know
[01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:42.140]  because but I guess they had to put something over there because the thing was so big but
[01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:48.140]  But we've you know ergonomically we've gotten to the point where it seems pretty obvious that you put your fingers on the keyboard
[01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:54.220]  Like you're typing and your thumbs are just right there where a trackpad goes and you know
[01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:57.340]  Where a trackpad goes and so wouldn't it be nice
[01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:00.140]  If you're when you're using an ipad
[01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:05.260]  If you could just make use of those thumbs that are right there without lifting them up, you know
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:07.500]  So I feel like there's an ergonomic argument
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:10.140]  on the software side
[01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:18.140]  This is where I think it's more interesting and nuanced is because I think the better argument against touch screen max
[01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:20.540]  is that
[01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:21.660]  by
[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:23.340]  by assuming
[01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:25.340]  That every single mac
[01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:29.180]  Has a mouse pointer attachment you either have a mouse
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:32.540]  Or a trackpad. I mean, it's almost impossible
[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:38.460]  I mean you could run a mac as a kiosk of some sort without a keyboard and mouse but to actually use a mac
[01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:41.820]  it's borderline impossible without uh
[01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:49.660]  As a typical user, you know, it's you know, nobody would really want to use a mac without a mouse pointer a mouse or a trackpad
[01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:52.780]  And those are very fine precise pointing things
[01:23:54.940 --> 01:24:01.340]  There's all sorts of ui elements that are able to be packed as small targets close together and my
[01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:06.060]  The most prominent example are the red yellow green buttons for closing a window
[01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:13.180]  Minimizing a window and full screen zooming a window. They're they're very small targets. They're very close to each other
[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:20.220]  And if they were touch targets, they would have to be further apart and that would take up more room in every single window
[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:26.620]  You know, there's also just looking at i'm looking at safari right now. There's just all sorts of stuff at the top of my safari window
[01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:28.620]  that's
[01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:32.620]  Way too small way too small of a target way too close to other targets
[01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:36.620]  To to be good for a touch interface
[01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:38.620]  I
[01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:46.060]  I so and you know, i'm not going to bet money that apple will never have a touchscreen mac. I mean, maybe it's inevitable
[01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:48.540]  I don't know because there's certainly a lot of people who think they want it
[01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:54.140]  But my my deep concern is that to do it right they would have to fundamentally change the mac
[01:24:54.380 --> 01:25:00.220]  Interface in a way that would make it less information dense, which I think is one of the convenient things about it
[01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:03.980]  Whereas I feel like you could add
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:09.020]  mouse support to ipad os without sacrificing anything
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:16.300]  In terms of the experience for what if you're just touching it like a you know, like like you
[01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:24.300]  Don't you if you never have a trackpad or mouse connected to it? Does it change the size or placement of any ui targets? No
[01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:33.340]  Right, I feel like it i'm not saying it's easy nobody. I don't want to ever tell engineers that anything can happen
[01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:35.760]  or engineers that anything is easy, but I think conceptually
[01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:44.540]  Ipad os is a much better fit for first-class mouse pointer support than mac os is a fit for touchscreen support
[01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:49.420]  I I agree with that and and and the reason why I also want them to do this is
[01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:53.260]  Because right now there's a on the ipad
[01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:59.820]  There's a fundamental case of feature disparity between the two different modes. So
[01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:01.820]  the
[01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:07.180]  What if you think about it what really sets the ipad apart from from the mac is the fact that you can
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:10.700]  Pull it out from the keyboard and just use it as a tablet
[01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:14.380]  Whereas a macbook you cannot just pull out the screen and use it
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:19.340]  It's always attached to the keyboard or if it's a desktop mac. It's always it needs to be a desktop computer
[01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:23.660]  So the ipad does support two different modes
[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:29.180]  And when it's in multi-touch mode, so you you don't have any keyboard accessory. You don't have any
[01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:31.020]  uh mouse
[01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:36.300]  It's fully usable like that, right? It fully supports multi-touch. It's got a software keyboard. It's fully usable
[01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:39.100]  but if you add a smart keyboard
[01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:41.980]  That's when the feature disparity comes in
[01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:44.060]  and and it's so
[01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:49.020]  funny right right now that it apple itself created this problem of
[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:54.940]  When you use a smart keyboard, you cannot fully use the ipad from the keyboard alone
[01:26:54.940 --> 01:27:01.580]  right because you still need to touch the screen and this is the keyboard that apple makes that apple sells and that apple promotes as the
[01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:03.820]  the accessory for the ipad pro so
[01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:10.060]  I think they should do it because right now the ipad can be used with the keyboard and I mean I use it
[01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:17.260]  I came up with all sorts of sorts of workarounds for like, um, I have a logitech mouse that I have with some shortcuts
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:23.580]  but it's not it's not native and you can feel that it's an afterthought and and
[01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:24.540]  and
[01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:27.580]  Whereas the ipad is fully usable as a tablet in touch mode
[01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:30.140]  It is not fully native
[01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:35.900]  If you want to use it with a keyboard and so i'm seeing like a bunch of people on twitter saying
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:38.540]  If they're gonna do it if they're gonna add a cursor
[01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:44.060]  It's just gonna be for text fields maybe but I think it should be a real cursor and I think it should be
[01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:47.420]  Like real pointing device that lets you control the the whole ui
[01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:52.220]  I I you know, I could see it but I as being just for text
[01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:55.660]  Like you said exactly like the virtual
[01:27:56.700 --> 01:28:04.060]  Trackpad you can get and you can get it on the iphone too by holding down on the spacebar now that 3d touch is gone
[01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:09.660]  And what it's a two two finger touch on the virtual keyboard on ipad os
[01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:11.740]  right
[01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:18.300]  If you yes, you just go there and two fingers fingers. Yeah, you put two fingers down anywhere on the keyboard
[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:22.060]  Which is really nice. Very very nice. You don't have to aim for the
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:25.260]  Spacebar
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:28.220]  Uh, so there's a tip of the day every time I mention something like that
[01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:30.940]  I know that there's people who are like, holy crap. I didn't know you could do that
[01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:37.340]  You know virtual virtual keyboard up on the ipad put two fingers anywhere on the keyboard and you get while you're editing text
[01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:39.900]  And you can move the insertion point around
[01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:44.860]  I I just don't think though that they would if they're if they're going to go so far as to actually put a trackpad
[01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:49.580]  On the smart keyboard. I just don't see exactly why they wouldn't do it for everything and I really do think
[01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:55.180]  I really do think and I there might be some edge cases. I there's always edge cases
[01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:57.580]  There's always something that's tricky, but I think for the most part
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:05.980]  It it won't take away from touch at all. I I really do feel that that's that's true and that it's just sort of
[01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:13.500]  That's true and that it's just sort of a historical artifact of the fact that the ipad was derived from
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:16.300]  the iphone's operating system
[01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:19.020]  That it doesn't didn't have it right from the start
[01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:24.300]  Yeah, yeah, and and i've been i've been like part of this
[01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:31.740]  Computing life I guess for the past several years at this point and really, um
[01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:35.180]  Whenever I I like a share a photo of like my ipad setup
[01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:38.700]  I always got a bunch of people saying why don't you just use a mac and and
[01:29:39.340 --> 01:29:45.180]  while I do get the point right because it does look like when when you're using the ipad with the keyboard and maybe a
[01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:49.740]  Mouse and maybe some other accessory. It does look like a laptop but that like to me
[01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:57.020]  that's like the whole point of the conversation of like if I want I can pull out the tablet and go
[01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:59.500]  work on the couch or
[01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:04.780]  or stay in bed and that that is actually how I started using the ipad like when I was sick and
[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:06.700]  undergoing
[01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:08.380]  cancer treatments years ago
[01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:12.060]  And I couldn't use a macbook and I just had the ipad and I was able to like
[01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:14.700]  Stay in the in the hospital bed and use the ipad
[01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:16.700]  as a tablet
[01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:21.900]  And that to me is really the greatest strength of of the device like it can
[01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:25.100]  And I know that it's an overused term
[01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:30.300]  but it can be a sort of like hybrid computer in the sense that it's tablet and then you just
[01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:33.580]  Slide it into a keyboard and it becomes sort of like laptop
[01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:41.580]  So, yeah, I really do think that the two modes can can coexist and when it comes to the trackpad
[01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:44.220]  I was just thinking about this as we were talking about it
[01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:52.800]  We we've seen all these concepts, uh, you linked one of them on on during fireball for uh, like rethinking ipad multitasking
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:58.900]  And I was thinking about these concepts and and then the new the rumor came out today of the trackpad
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:03.600]  And so I realized if there's an opportunity for apple to bring
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:05.920]  some consistency
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:08.800]  Um to a new multitasking, uh interface
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:14.000]  What better way to add consistency than to say there's new gestures
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:20.080]  Uh that you can use for multitouch if you want to use multitasking and split view and the same gestures
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:27.040]  Actually work with our multitouch trackpad on the smart keyboard, but it's always the same gestures. It's always the same
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:30.480]  Interaction
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:35.360]  System and you can use it via touch and you can use it with the keyboard and I and I think renee
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:42.480]  Richie on youtube also had a some kind of concept of a couple of months back maybe arguing
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:50.720]  Arguing, uh, if apple were to do a new multitasking system on ipad, maybe they should consider multi-touch gestures gestures, so
[01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:56.560]  That could potentially be interesting if if it's also a multi-touch trackpad on the smart keyboard, of course
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:03.280]  Yeah, I think it would be too because I think that they're all in on that in terms and it's a way to bring some
[01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:09.360]  Consistency, you know between the mac and ios. I mean, I can't imagine that it wouldn't be right like
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:11.360]  Uh
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:17.840]  I don't know. It's it's it's it is one of the most exciting rumors and it's so funny because we you know
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:20.960]  We could have recorded yesterday. We would have done the whole show before it broke
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:25.200]  But to me, it's honestly one of the most exciting rumors in a long
[01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:31.440]  While i'm terribly excited about it because it's not just about having the trackpad. It's everything that it says
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:34.720]  About what? I think they would need to do with ipad os
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:38.880]  To make it worthwhile having a first-party trackpad, right?
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:46.000]  Um, and I I just can't help but think that it would mean that you could put two fingers on it to scroll
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:51.840]  A scroll view right like yeah, but that also implies some sort of focus, you know
[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:57.200]  Whether it's a mouse hovering over it, you know, like on the mac, it's whatever wherever the mouse cursor is hovering
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:02.640]  You can scroll up and down with two fingers to scroll the thing including in a background window, you know
[01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:05.200]  But what determines it you don't even have to click on it
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:09.920]  You just put the mouse cursor over it and then use two fingers to go up and down to scroll the view
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:12.720]  it it would it it would be
[01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:16.320]  Baffling
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:20.080]  If they don't support that right like what's the point of having a trackpad if you can't
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:24.000]  If you can't scroll with it if you still have to do it, I mean
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:30.160]  Would it mean that literally every single thing in the system could be done from the keyboard and trackpad?
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:37.200]  Maybe right that almost seems like like one part of me wants to say well, maybe not everything but then I want to say why not?
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:40.800]  Right, like why right? What is there that you wouldn't be able to do?
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:44.080]  you know with the combination of
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:50.400]  Moving the cursor as a virtual finger over elements and tapping to simulate a touch
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:55.040]  and the combination of multi-fingered gestures for things like
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:58.640]  You know
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:05.280]  Bringing I don't know. I mean, would you be able to bring down control center with a drag from the top of the trackpad?
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:10.320]  I don't know. Yeah, you could do expose now that you have multiple windows on ipad
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:12.320]  You could do that. You could show the
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:18.560]  The app switcher and maybe again if they were to add a new a different multitasking system
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:23.360]  You could have gestures for split view and slide over and that kind of stuff
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:26.080]  So yeah, I mean why not, right?
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:33.600]  so if you go to the so far as to add a physical trackpad to the smart keyboard, which is
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:36.880]  super premium space, right you
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:41.600]  You go to such lengths as to add an actual trackpad
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:47.200]  limiting that trackpad to just scrolling text fields and and text views
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:55.540]  That seems like a wasted opportunity. It just it just seems a little spiteful, you know, like not not that not spiteful
[01:34:55.540 --> 01:35:01.640]  that apple doesn't like ipad users and wants them to be frustrated but like spitefully
[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:10.500]  Sticking to the idea that it's fundamentally a touch screen, you know, I mean it it's it's putting an idea
[01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:18.660]  Above the actual practicality of would this actually be useful without taking away from anything that's already good
[01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:23.940]  It will be political. Yeah more than practical. Yeah, which or dogmatic?
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:28.820]  I don't know. What word you want to use right? Like you're just sticking to this dogma that no longer holds
[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:30.580]  um
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:34.100]  Well, no one thing that comes to me and and this is why it's fascinating me
[01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:39.060]  I love reading your stuff on ipad and and i've complained a bit recently and
[01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:42.500]  I have a couple more complaints to get off my chest before i'm done
[01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:44.340]  um
[01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:46.340]  about the state of ipad os
[01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:49.140]  and
[01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:50.180]  there's just
[01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:55.140]  I i'm not you know, it there's just so many people who who got angry at me
[01:35:57.060 --> 01:36:00.900]  Oh, really people get angry at you and and I don't get it
[01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:04.500]  I really tried to write around it and anticipate it and and you know
[01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:09.860]  The basic idea is if you come up with if like me you have a bunch of what I think are very valid complaints
[01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:11.940]  About the current state of ipad os
[01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:14.420]  And you describe them
[01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:18.980]  To the best of your ability and then all of a sudden it's well you hate the ipad because you're an old
[01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:23.540]  Person who likes the mac and you want to you just want the ipad to be a mac and it's like no I don't
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:27.540]  What I would like ideally would I love the mac and and again?
[01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:31.960]  I'm a sort of person if I had to choose between ipad and mac for the rest of my life without hesitation
[01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:37.140]  Half a second. I would choose mac that that's just where I am. That's who I am. No surprise from what i've written
[01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:41.940]  But holy crap wouldn't it be amazing if the ipad got so good that I thought wow
[01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:45.060]  Even I as a mac person think this is better. That would be better, right?
[01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:48.980]  Like I love the mac. The mac is still my favorite operating system. There is
[01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:51.140]  but
[01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:53.140]  I i'm not like
[01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:57.700]  Going to look anything. I I would love to find something better, right?
[01:36:57.700 --> 01:37:00.740]  Like people think well if you love the mac and you that's your thing
[01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:08.580]  Then you're some kind of zealot and no matter what anybody else does you're going to find ways to to say the mac is better
[01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:10.580]  The mac is better
[01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:14.660]  I'm that's not my mindset at all. I love the mac
[01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:21.220]  And so therefore if there were ever something from apple or any other company that I thought was a better overall system than the mac
[01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:23.700]  That would be amazing because the mac is already great
[01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:28.260]  So it would be great if the ipad got better. I would love to see the ipad get better. So
[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:32.580]  I I don't understand the defensiveness on some people's parts and that's one thing
[01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:35.220]  I don't know how you get away with it because you're well known as
[01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:38.020]  an ipad power user
[01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:40.020]  and somebody who really
[01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:42.500]  Uh, it just fits with your brain
[01:37:42.580 --> 01:37:46.180]  I mean, that's what you're trying to I I know what you're trying to say is like the reason
[01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:50.420]  That you like using an ipad for everything and the reason why when people say well
[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:54.020]  why don't you just use a mac for that is that the ipad is like
[01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:56.740]  it for me
[01:37:56.740 --> 01:38:02.500]  Mac os fits my brain and maybe my brain has been warped to fit mac os over the years
[01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:09.700]  But it's very clear from your writing and your enthusiasm and the clever things you come up with with shortcuts and stuff like that
[01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:17.140]  That the ipad os just fits your brain, right? It is a natural extension of your brain
[01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:25.540]  And and it's like the lack of keyboard support is like at times for certain tasks. One of your hands is tied behind your back
[01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:26.980]  Yes
[01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:28.500]  Yeah, yes
[01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:34.820]  Like I feel bad for you. I feel that that I do I really do because I feel like
[01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:36.820]  right now
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:38.180]  it
[01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:44.180]  the ipad is constrained in ways that aren't it's not like oh, well, that would be impossible to solve right like if you
[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:52.740]  Just off the top of my head if you really wanted siri to be as intelligent as the howl computer in
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:55.620]  2001 and be able to hold a real conversation with you
[01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:58.340]  well to get from where we are today to there is
[01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:05.940]  An awful lot of work and maybe who knows maybe it's not even technical possibly technically possible. Ai is never going to get there
[01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:07.780]  whereas
[01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:13.060]  Getting mouse cursor proper mouse pointer support in ipad os that's obviously technically possible
[01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:18.740]  Right, like this is it's it's a design decision not a technical or engineering limitation
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:21.540]  Mm-hmm. It's like
[01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:25.780]  Like it's exactly that like it's it's so close, right?
[01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:30.340]  You can you can see the thing actually in front of you, but you cannot reach it, right?
[01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:37.540]  Especially now that that we have that that sort of like, uh external pointing device feature
[01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:40.180]  But it says it is an accessibility feature
[01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:46.260]  So it's not exactly that and it's so close and you can feel like that reality is within my grasp
[01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:50.900]  But the the closer you get the the further away from you it escapes
[01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:52.740]  and and that is why i'm so
[01:39:53.540 --> 01:40:00.660]  Excited about this rumor and as you said the the the the reason why I keep using the ipad is
[01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:07.780]  one yes, because it does fit my my my brain at this point better and two I would say because I
[01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:15.060]  Ever since I was unable to get any work done and we're talking now seven years ago and everything is fine now
[01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:17.540]  that is well in the past, but
[01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:18.980]  that
[01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:22.660]  Like like it scared me in the sense that I
[01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:28.920]  The ipad i'm working on the ipad. I know that I always have a fallback
[01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:30.820]  bolt-in
[01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:37.060]  In the sense that if I cannot work with my keyboard and my mouse and my vertical stand
[01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:44.740]  I can still hold the thing in my hands and and stay in bed and and send an email right and so that
[01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:47.460]  I like that
[01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:51.960]  Disability you could say like years ago. It it really
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:41:00.360]  Left an impression in my brain in terms of I never want to just depend on a desktop computer ever again
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:02.840]  and that is why i've always like been on a
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:09.080]  Sort of quest to see like what's a way to to do this in with full
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:11.680]  portability with full mobility
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:13.080]  and and
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:18.040]  that is why like I I got a lot of people making fun of me whenever I share like a like a
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:24.680]  complex shortcut and years ago used to be like a python scripts with with pythonista and and
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:31.420]  It used to be url schemes before that launched launchcenter pro, which which launched which is still a great utility
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:33.880]  but launchcenter pro
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:41.240]  Like when it first came out was a way to get interapp inter application communication all through all through url schemes
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:43.160]  which can get
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:44.520]  complicated
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:48.360]  it can it can get complicated but still
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:54.280]  It did allow me to to to be more efficient years ago. So, um
[01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:57.240]  I like
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:41:58.840]  I generally get why
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:05.560]  Like people like you and and and people like stephen hackett, for example, um prefer working on mac OS and I think it's totally like
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:11.800]  Fine, and I think it's so silly that some people on twitter think that like
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:19.480]  Oh now they're gonna fight it out to the ipad guys versus the mac guys and and I don't think it's like that at all
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:21.880]  no, uh, I think if anything like
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:28.360]  It is there's there's a certain and and I struggle to explain this whenever I get into these arguments on twitter
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:33.400]  there's a beauty to the idea like a fundamental beauty to the idea that that
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:36.440]  Two operating systems can co-exist within each other
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:38.280]  and
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:40.120]  I I see
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:44.440]  I see the beauty in that in the in the sense of you can choose
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:51.480]  What you what you want to use like you can choose your favorite computer and I think that's beautiful and I think it's like
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:43:00.120]  Yes, I like working on the ipad and yes, I will like it to be more like a mac in in certain examples
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:05.560]  But I like I fully know that that it's not there yet and it's like
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:10.760]  because the those complaints that you get they always they also work the other way around like
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:16.280]  I get the comments from people saying oh you you're an ipad fanboy, uh, you're zealot
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:23.640]  You're never you know, you're never gonna say that anything else is better. Right and like that's so short-sighted and I
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:26.600]  fully agree with you in the sense that
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:32.760]  There are some things that need to be need need to be different. For example multitasking, right?
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:37.000]  Like, uh, so here's what i'm gonna say, um
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:40.840]  I think we need some kind of change
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:47.480]  What I don't want to see is a regression for
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:53.080]  People like me because right the current system so I the ios 11 is
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:58.680]  System for multitasking on ipad based on heavily based on drag and drop for
[01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:01.960]  Adding icons to split viewer slide over
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:09.160]  I know that system right? I I know how to use it. I I know how to operate it
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:12.760]  I know how to use the dock and multiple apps in slide over
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:15.560]  And those are powerful features
[01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:18.200]  at the same time I also think it's
[01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:23.800]  It's not the most intuitive it could be it. I I think it's
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:28.440]  I think it's too complicated for a lot of folks who are approaching the ipad now
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:32.440]  At the same time though as a power user. I don't want to lose those features
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:36.040]  So it's this kind of weird situation where like I know it needs to be different
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:38.200]  But I also don't want to lose what I already know
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:40.360]  I think
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:44.840]  Fundamentally, it's exactly the whole multiple of things that we need to do
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:51.340]  Fundamentally, it's exactly the whole multitasking thing and it is complicated. It is absolutely complicated
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:56.860]  It not just what what we already have being too complicated, but any idea of how to go forward
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:44:59.800]  it is
[01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:01.960]  Very very tricky and requires
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:06.360]  Really really top-notch ui design at a conceptual level
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.880]  But I really do also feel that it is ground zero of the fault line
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:14.440]  That ipad os has found itself in
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:15.800]  between
[01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:18.840]  the mac and iphone right and that being
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:21.480]  You know in theory
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:23.480]  the ipad could have been
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:25.080]  a
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:25.960]  a
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:30.680]  version of mac os with bigger touch targets instead of
[01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:33.560]  The phone os put on a bigger screen
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:38.600]  I don't think it should have been I think they made the right decision because I think that
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:44.920]  It put the uui stuff aside there's all sorts and you know, this is another thing i've been writing about recently
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:46.920]  but all sorts of complexity
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:54.700]  With the assumptions of mac os in terms of assumptions like that stuff can run in the background
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:59.080]  and that you can install apps from outside the app store and
[01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:06.280]  That you have direct access to the actual file system and people mix that up, right? Like
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:08.280]  people mix that up right like
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:11.400]  the files app on iphone ios
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:18.440]  Could get so much better and still never actually show you the actual
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:27.400]  File system of the device and I don't think it ever should right it's that because it it it is conceptually better and cleaner
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:30.280]  to only show the user
[01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:34.200]  Here are the files that are actual files that you
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:36.440]  create and read and diddle with
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:37.800]  and
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:44.600]  All of the stuff like the actual binaries for your application and stuff like that and the actual operating system
[01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:52.280]  Aren't even visible. That's a much better and cleaner design for people who aren't developers and actually aren't working at that level
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:55.960]  and
[01:46:55.960 --> 01:47:02.200]  The files app has gotten a lot better and I think it really it's obviously an area where it can continue to get better
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:05.400]  Without being mapped to the literal file system
[01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:08.920]  And I think it's such a better design
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:12.360]  Yeah
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:15.960]  All right before we go on like it. Yeah before we go on with multitasking
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:18.840]  Let me do the third and final sponsor and then we will run out the clock
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:23.560]  On multitasking but our third and final sponsor of the show is linode
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:29.080]  Oh, do I love this company too whether you're working on a personal project or managing your enterprise's infrastructure?
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:33.240]  Linode has the pricing support and scale you need to take your project to the next level
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:39.720]  It's a hosting company. It's where you host websites. It's where I host daring fireball and I love it
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:43.800]  They have 11 data centers worldwide including their newest in sydney, australia
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:48.060]  They have enterprise grade hardware s3 compatible
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:50.920]  api wise storage options
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:53.240]  and
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:48:00.040]  Uh everything of course, it's all modern ssd storage across the board 40 gigabit networking
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:02.840]  industry leading processors
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:08.360]  Their revamped cloud manager. That's just the fancy way of saying the web-based interface to your account
[01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:14.280]  It's an open source single page app cloud linode.com. It is fantastic
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:16.840]  It is absolutely great in every single way
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:24.120]  Hey, what if you're like a super nerd and you want like api access to to your servers? Look you get root access
[01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:31.500]  They have an api with a python command line interface full documentation at developers.linode.com
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:39.960]  Really just fantastic if you're a super nerd who knows even knows what it means to have a python command line interface library
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:41.960]  to the server
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:48.200]  And their plans this is great you think but how much does it cost? Well, guess what? They're nanode plan
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:54.600]  That's linode plus nano for being small nanode starts as low as five bucks a month
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:49:01.400]  And it's a really credible plan with like a gigabit of gigabyte of memory and you can really go a long way with that
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:09.560]  And it scales from that nanode plan, which is just five bucks a month scales all the way up to dedicated CPU plans
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:16.520]  With physical cores reserved just for you with no CPU steel if that's how high performance you need your stuff to be
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:23.400]  They also have GPU computing plans that are suitable for AI and machine learning and video processing
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:26.840]  Of course, which always goes through the GPU to be efficient
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:34.220]  All sorts of stuff like that one-click installs of most of the popular apps including stuff like wordpress
[01:49:34.220 --> 01:49:41.980]  Game servers from minecraft stuff like that and more anything that you think might be a one-click install for your own custom server
[01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:48.320]  They've got it at linode. So use this promo code talk show 2020 talk show 2020

[01:50:19.500 --> 01:50:21.500]  All right, the multitasking thing
[01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:23.660]  so
[01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:27.820]  Ryan who works with you at max stories? What's his last name? I don't know
[01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:34.140]  Remember it crystal fall crystal fall. He had a really good article and I linked to it. Uh, and I promised a fuller response
[01:50:34.540 --> 01:50:37.500]  Which I haven't finished yet. I am working on but I could talk about it here
[01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:43.820]  But he had a proposal that I think was really good and it tackled some of the issues I mentioned which is that I think
[01:50:43.820 --> 01:50:45.820]  It's just so incredibly frustrating
[01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:51.260]  That the way that you get the first app on screen is the obvious way which shouldn't change you
[01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:54.060]  See the app and you tap the icon and then it opens and it's fully
[01:50:54.060 --> 01:50:57.580]  Screened and the way you get the second app on screen is totally different
[01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:03.340]  His idea for managing some of this is to use contextual menus
[01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:08.460]  And I have a couple of I've thought about it. I have a couple of problems with that
[01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:11.900]  One is I think that at a fundamental level
[01:51:13.340 --> 01:51:16.400]  Contextual menus should always be a shortcut
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:24.400]  To something for which there's another way to do it and unless i'm overlooking something
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:26.240]  on the mac
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:32.400]  You know contextual menus are what you get when you right click or control click is if you want to you know
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:37.920]  Control clicking is a long dating back to the era when max only had one button mice from apple
[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:41.840]  Control click is always a synonym for right-clicking
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:48.160]  Um, I don't think there's anything you can do on the mac in a contextual menu that there isn't
[01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:53.200]  Another way to do it if there's an exception to that i'd love to hear it
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:56.480]  But I I can't think of one and i've been trying to think of one recently
[01:51:57.040 --> 01:52:00.480]  Whereas ryan's proposal would make certain things
[01:52:01.020 --> 01:52:07.120]  Contextual menu only and maybe that's true, you know and ipad os is different than mac ou
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:14.080]  And contextual menus on ipad os are different because now like you have to tap and hold to get to
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:20.640]  What I call jiggle mode to rearrange your icons on the home screen and that's right really only accessible through a contextual menu
[01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:27.840]  And one of the reasons but even in files, but even in files, so the main difference I think is that on ipad
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:31.680]  Some actions are context menu only
[01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:36.320]  Right, it is a little different. So maybe it would fit better. Um
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:43.280]  I just feel though that it's still at a broader sense. I still feel that his contextual menu
[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:48.080]  Idea is still too indirect. Like if if I have
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:53.360]  Two apps open on my ipad at once and one's on the left and one's on the right
[01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:57.360]  And I would like to swap them and put them on my ipad
[01:52:57.360 --> 01:53:03.920]  On the left and one's on the right and I would like to swap them and put the one on the one side on the other
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000]  You can just drag it over, right?
[01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:11.440]  You you can just drag the one on the left over to the right which is what you think would happen
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:17.280]  I think way more of the multitasking features in the ipad should be like that
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:21.840]  Where you just do the obvious thing and you tap on a certain area, you know
[01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:25.840]  And maybe the difference would be that they would have to add
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:27.040]  some
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:32.880]  For lack of a better word window chrome even though they're not windows like a window is a thing that floats around and you can
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:35.360]  Drag it anywhere you want. I think it's actually a
[01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:42.880]  Better idea for most people in most cases to have for lack of a better word a tile interface
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:47.920]  Like that's one of the things that I feel like apple is even struggling with I don't think they know what to call things
[01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:52.880]  On ipad os they call things windows that to me aren't windows, right?
[01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:56.720]  Right. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's more in fact
[01:53:56.880 --> 01:54:02.080]  It's more descriptive in in the api where they call them scenes, right?
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:05.120]  I think that's that's a better name for it because they're not windows
[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:09.760]  They are multiple scenes for the same application. I think it actually makes more sense, right?
[01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:12.640]  Yeah, so like in safari
[01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:16.560]  And you say new tab you're on the ipad and you say new tab
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:22.480]  it's very everybody gets exactly what you think you get a thing that looks like a tab and if you're used to tabs on
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:24.720]  you know mac os or
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:32.400]  Windows or chrome os or anywhere else where there's tabs in a browser you get a thing now that looks like a tab in a browser
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:38.720]  Whereas what they're calling windows don't look like windows anywhere else and I feel like it's just is a
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:45.360]  It it's like the confusion of the concept as it currently stands leaking out into the language
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:47.200]  They choose to use to describe it
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:53.040]  I just think that it should be a lot more direct and you know that concept I linked to
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:58.880]  Earlier this week from a kid. I call him a kid. He's 21 on twitter, uh
[01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:02.960]  You know where it more or less and I don't know if that's the right decision
[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:06.640]  But I do I saw a lot of people on twitter who seem to like it
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:09.520]  But the idea is that you know you kind of turn
[01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:13.760]  if you want to have two apps on screen at once it kind of his concept to put it in
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:19.440]  As short of a few words as possible kind of turns each half of the screen into an ipad mini
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:24.160]  And so if you like go up if you have two apps at once and you zip one up from the bottom
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:26.320]  You know like the home screen shortcut
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:32.080]  You get a miniature version of your whole home screen on the right staff half of the screen and you can just tap another app
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:34.080]  And it takes that half of the screen
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:40.400]  Is that the right solution? I don't know but it something along those lines though feels so much more
[01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:42.560]  natural
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:45.700]  Natural to me and it feels more ipad-like
[01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:50.160]  So what I think is happening now, um is
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:56.800]  If you remember when when splitview first came out in 2015 with ios 9
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:56:04.640]  And the way that you that you used to invoke like a secondary app used to be that you would swipe from the
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:10.080]  Right edge of the display and you would get like this scrollable list of icons
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:12.000]  of icons
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:19.040]  And those icons in theory were like your recently used apps and you would tap one and it would come in in splitview
[01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:25.760]  And we had that system for a couple of years and at some point we all started wishing for
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:28.800]  some kind of different
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:33.280]  picker view and at the time and this is like
[01:56:33.980 --> 01:56:37.840]  2016 so we're talking ios 10 before 11 came out
[01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:45.440]  Uh, there were all kinds of concepts. I I even commissioned one of them. I still have the video on mac stories
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:47.360]  I remember this
[01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:52.240]  Envisioning like what if the right side of the screen was more like a home screen?
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:56.880]  And you would have like a grid of icons and you could search the icons and then you would tap
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:56:58.720]  Just like you tap on home screen
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:04.820]  You would tap and you would bring in the secondary app and then ios 11 comes out and wwc 2017
[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:11.300]  Apple announces this new system and they swing in a completely different direction and they're like
[01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:15.800]  What if we took this idea of direct manipulation?
[01:57:16.580 --> 01:57:18.660]  And we just went nuts with it
[01:57:18.980 --> 01:57:23.380]  So anything like you want to multitask you can just drag things around
[01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:28.340]  And you pick up the icon and you bring it into a space and you create a split view and all of that
[01:57:28.660 --> 01:57:31.620]  And so they they took this idea of like on ipad
[01:57:31.620 --> 01:57:34.740]  Instead there's direct manipulation. There's multitouch. So
[01:57:35.460 --> 01:57:43.300]  Why not build multitasking around it? And I think now couple of years have passed and and ipad os is now a thing
[01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:46.500]  And you can you can actually do more you can
[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:54.100]  Have multiple apps in slide over you can have multiple windows, but we're back at square one and we're saying well
[01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:58.100]  But what if you actually had a simplified picker for split view?
[01:57:58.100 --> 01:58:05.060]  So I think at some point they just they just need to do it because it seems to be like this cycle that goes on forever
[01:58:05.940 --> 01:58:09.540]  And apple maybe eventually comes up with another solution
[01:58:09.700 --> 01:58:13.700]  But maybe people just want to have some kind of home screen some kind of launcher
[01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:19.460]  That is consistent with the actual home screen because the other systems
[01:58:20.180 --> 01:58:24.420]  And I say this as somebody who really likes the current system
[01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:27.940]  But maybe it's not that I like it so much that I know it, right?
[01:58:28.580 --> 01:58:34.020]  And and and I think I even if I know it well, and even if I can work my way around it
[01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:36.740]  I know that it's flawed
[01:58:36.740 --> 01:58:38.740]  It works for somebody like me
[01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:42.180]  but I know that it's not the best solution for other people and I think
[01:58:42.740 --> 01:58:48.260]  At some point they just need to to do it and maybe a home screen is a solution. Maybe some kind of different
[01:58:48.260 --> 01:58:53.700]  Current grid view is a solution, but the current system is more
[01:58:55.220 --> 01:58:57.780]  Maybe it's more fancy than it needs to be, right?
[01:58:58.020 --> 01:58:58.420]  Oh, yeah
[01:58:58.420 --> 01:59:02.820]  What if you can pick up anything and you and if you drop it here it becomes
[01:59:03.380 --> 01:59:08.660]  Slide over and if you drop it there, it becomes split view and it's it's fine for people like me
[01:59:08.660 --> 01:59:10.740]  But it's not great for for everybody else
[01:59:11.700 --> 01:59:15.940]  The craziest thing about it and I really think this is undeniably true
[01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:21.540]  and this is why I love reading your stuff about it is that you as you know, an ipad aficionado, you know, you're
[01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:24.180]  perfectly willing to
[01:59:24.180 --> 01:59:25.780]  admit it is
[01:59:25.780 --> 01:59:27.780]  It to me. It's crazy
[01:59:28.020 --> 01:59:28.820]  that
[01:59:28.820 --> 01:59:31.480]  That to be a power user on the ipad
[01:59:31.940 --> 01:59:37.300]  Is more complicated than to be a power user at the equivalent level and do the same things on the mac
[01:59:37.700 --> 01:59:41.540]  Like it should not be that way. It should be easier on the ipad
[01:59:41.540 --> 01:59:46.260]  Like the mac is has this historical cruft, you know
[01:59:46.260 --> 01:59:51.620]  like I said like just a perfect little stupid example like when you select an app or a file in
[01:59:52.260 --> 01:59:58.020]  The finder and you hit the return key people expect it to open if they're not long-time mac users
[01:59:58.020 --> 02:00:04.020]  But that's not what happens you read you're renaming the file and you have to hit command down or command open like
[02:00:04.580 --> 02:00:06.580]  the mac has a whole
[02:00:06.580 --> 02:00:12.520]  Arm's length long list of stuff like that that really should never change because it's too historically
[02:00:13.860 --> 02:00:17.860]  You know baked in and there's a reason for it being the way it is
[02:00:18.820 --> 02:00:20.820]  Or the whole double, you know
[02:00:21.220 --> 02:00:26.820]  dub I I wrote about this like that that you double click applications to launch them on the mac because
[02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:34.520]  Single clicking selects it and it's worth it. You know the the official way double clicking historically
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:39.100]  It was a shortcut the official way like in 1984
[02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:46.040]  To open an application was to click on it to select it go up to the file menu and hit open
[02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:47.720]  you know and
[02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:51.480]  You know because that you know, it was everything was sort of like through the you know
[02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:56.920]  The commands were in the file menu or in the menu bar and then everything else was a shortcut
[02:00:57.080 --> 02:01:03.480]  So there were keyboard shortcuts like command o as a shortcut for file open and then they added a mouse shortcut
[02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:07.240]  Which is well, what if you want to just skip the whole file menu and you're an advanced user?
[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:09.240]  You could just double click the item
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:16.200]  Well, everybody, you know, it ends up that's so much more convenient. Nobody selects an item and goes up to the file menu and hits open
[02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:22.680]  But then we wound up with a generation of people who think you have to double click links in a web browser
[02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:25.960]  Because they think you double you double click to open stuff
[02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:29.320]  it's it's a
[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:35.080]  I love mac os and I love the mac and I I am so so proficient in it
[02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:38.520]  but i'm perfectly willing to admit it's it is not
[02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:45.960]  It is a target that the ipad should be able to surpass in in almost every regard
[02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:51.160]  For almost every user as just just using it system, you know
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:55.960]  Yeah, I agree with that. It should empower everyone not just people like me
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:02:00.440]  Yeah, and and it and and it's complicated to say that you can drag in
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:04.920]  How do you move an icon from your first home screen to your second screen?
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:12.520]  Well, you you drag it but dragging the icon is also the way that you make it a split screen app, you know, it's it
[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:14.760]  that's
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:19.000]  It makes sense when you understand the context of how you start those drags
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:26.200]  But that sort of hey just dragging the app icon does these two entirely different things
[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:32.680]  One of them is moving it. The other one is opening it up into a window in split view or or
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:37.000]  What's it called slide over slide over
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:43.080]  That's that's that's the sort of thing i'm talking about where to understand that makes you
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:48.380]  Understanding more complexity than the mac user under it needs to understand to do the equivalent thing
[02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:52.620]  yeah, I and I look I don't disagree with that and I think
[02:02:53.660 --> 02:02:58.940]  What I was seeing before like I don't want to lose the current options because as a as a pro user
[02:03:00.060 --> 02:03:03.260]  I do enjoy like the freedom that this system
[02:03:03.820 --> 02:03:07.660]  Gives me in the sense that I can because I know how it works
[02:03:07.660 --> 02:03:13.900]  I can choose exactly where I want to drop an icon and how I want to make it a split view
[02:03:14.140 --> 02:03:16.140]  Like I know all the all the little
[02:03:16.780 --> 02:03:18.780]  sorry
[02:03:19.020 --> 02:03:24.380]  I know all the little like hidden tricks of it. Like if you if you drop an icon toward the
[02:03:25.020 --> 02:03:27.660]  Upper edge of the display it becomes a full screen
[02:03:27.900 --> 02:03:35.180]  Uh window and like all these little things I know but like how would you even expose them to to regular folks?
[02:03:35.180 --> 02:03:40.620]  And I don't think that I I don't think that an onboarding process when you're setting up
[02:03:40.620 --> 02:03:46.220]  Yeah, but for the first time like those three pages, I don't think those are nearly enough even with the short
[02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:50.860]  video that you see at setup and um
[02:03:52.380 --> 02:03:54.700]  And there's like what really surprises me though
[02:03:54.780 --> 02:04:00.220]  Is that is that certain and and you brought this up on during fireball multiple times like there have been
[02:04:00.220 --> 02:04:05.580]  design issues with the current multitasking system on ipad and and before
[02:04:06.220 --> 02:04:10.140]  Doing this this episode. I actually went back and checked on mac stories
[02:04:10.220 --> 02:04:13.900]  and and these are issues that I mentioned all the way back in 2015 in my
[02:04:14.620 --> 02:04:16.620]  ios 9 review like
[02:04:17.020 --> 02:04:21.660]  Try and tell which side of a split view is as keyboard focus
[02:04:21.740 --> 02:04:25.420]  Yeah at any given moment and they they sort of
[02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:28.700]  quote-unquote made it better in 13 by
[02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:32.060]  slightly changing the color of the
[02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:39.020]  Pale shaped indicator right at the top of a split view but good luck trying to tell the difference between two
[02:04:39.100 --> 02:04:45.020]  Very similar shades of gray right if you can and that's one of them and the other design problem is
[02:04:45.580 --> 02:04:51.500]  There's such a tiny difference like visually speaking between dropping an icon
[02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:57.180]  And it becomes a split view item and dropping an icon and it becomes a slide over item
[02:04:57.580 --> 02:05:02.540]  And basically the difference is you gotta take a look at the corner radius of the window to tell
[02:05:03.180 --> 02:05:09.980]  Who came up with that but also how was it not fixed or like five years later and so
[02:05:10.700 --> 02:05:18.380]  Yeah, there's like it needs it needs to empower everybody and it does you shouldn't have to read a manual
[02:05:18.380 --> 02:05:23.340]  Or a review. Yes know how it works and and so basically just to wrap up
[02:05:23.580 --> 02:05:25.820]  I I really do and I think we're exactly on the same page
[02:05:25.820 --> 02:05:31.980]  I just think that the ipad os needs a little bit more visual affordances, you know, yes and
[02:05:32.780 --> 02:05:39.980]  Close buttons right like how do you close if you're in a app with multiple documents? How do you close a thing?
[02:05:39.980 --> 02:05:41.660]  Well, why isn't that a standard?
[02:05:41.660 --> 02:05:46.620]  Why isn't there a red button and I really do think and I don't want to pin it all on johnny
[02:05:46.620 --> 02:05:53.500]  I've shoulders, but I kind of want to just pin it all on johnny. I've shoulders. Is that I feel that in the post?
[02:05:54.860 --> 02:06:00.140]  Johnny I've is control in control of all ui which is from ios 7 forward
[02:06:00.780 --> 02:06:05.580]  I feel like apple has always erred on the side of minimalism too far
[02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:13.580]  And that they're just it there should be more that you can do by just seeing a thing on screen
[02:06:13.580 --> 02:06:21.580]  And being able to poke it with your finger and touch it to close it or touch it to drag it or touch it to move it
[02:06:22.620 --> 02:06:25.660]  And just a little bit not a lot just a little
[02:06:26.540 --> 02:06:31.580]  And and you know, like I said the one of the things that the ipad os already gets right is if you have two apps
[02:06:31.580 --> 02:06:37.980]  Split screen left and right you can swap them by just dragging it over and that's perfect
[02:06:37.980 --> 02:06:39.980]  But I just feel like there should be more like that
[02:06:39.980 --> 02:06:47.900]  Yeah, yeah, I agree with that. It's not a it's not a scene to have buttons or other visual affordances to
[02:06:49.020 --> 02:06:53.500]  once again, you know, it's great that we have these hidden gestures, but
[02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:56.140]  It's not so great for other people
[02:06:56.140 --> 02:07:01.020]  No, and so and it should they should be shortcuts for for and I feel like there should be a lot more that's exposed
[02:07:01.020 --> 02:07:05.340]  And maybe you have to take more steps to do it the visual one finger way
[02:07:05.340 --> 02:07:12.060]  Tapping the thing you see on screen and that a you know multi-fingered gesture or shortcut can be a shortcut for it for power users
[02:07:12.060 --> 02:07:13.900]  But there should still be
[02:07:13.900 --> 02:07:15.900]  A way that you can get there visually
[02:07:16.780 --> 02:07:18.220]  Yeah
[02:07:18.220 --> 02:07:25.260]  Uh, my final question to you before we wrap up is do you regret do you regret naming the website mac stories?
[02:07:30.300 --> 02:07:32.300]  Well, I get
[02:07:32.300 --> 02:07:35.740]  I get asked this a lot surprisingly. Um,
[02:07:36.780 --> 02:07:39.100]  I I really don't because
[02:07:41.340 --> 02:07:44.940]  No, look i'm honest I really don't because it's um
[02:07:45.500 --> 02:07:50.780]  At some point like five years ago. I considered like, uh, I should change the name of this website
[02:07:51.580 --> 02:07:53.580]  Because it's not who I am anymore
[02:07:54.220 --> 02:07:57.580]  But then it was a combination of well now
[02:07:57.580 --> 02:08:03.580]  A lot of people know the website as mac stories and and like it's you know, it gets linked in a bunch of places
