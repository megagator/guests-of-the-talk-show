[00:00.000 --> 00:04.640]  So where to start I say we let's just talk about Renee Ritchie. Let's talk year in review. Yes
[00:05.160 --> 00:07.440]  Where better to start than January?
[00:08.040 --> 00:10.220]  It was a quiet beginning of the year
[00:10.220 --> 00:14.380]  It was so quiet that people were again pounding the doom drums that Apple wasn't doing anything anymore
[00:14.960 --> 00:18.800]  Yeah, and maybe even before we get into details like January
[00:19.520 --> 00:26.440]  Maybe just take that and and use it like to me like the year in review as a whole like with zoom out big level
[00:26.440 --> 00:28.440]  What are we gonna look back on this year? I?
[00:28.440 --> 00:31.080]  I would say that this was the year where?
[00:32.280 --> 00:33.800]  that
[00:33.800 --> 00:40.640]  That sense that that Apple can't do it anymore since got rubbed away slowly, but surely over the course of the year. I
[00:41.320 --> 00:46.520]  Agree, I think it built up to I think it reached a crescendo because you know people kept making a big deal of Tim Cook
[00:46.520 --> 00:52.960]  Saying we'd be releasing new product character categories throughout the year and then as the months ticked on they seem to get more and more
[00:53.120 --> 00:55.120]  personally angry with him
[00:55.120 --> 00:59.580]  Yeah, I think so too, and I think because it the the naysayers
[01:00.520 --> 01:06.640]  Have been the down on cook overall anyway like that's the root of their naysaying
[01:07.080 --> 01:12.320]  Yeah, we go over the short term at least they wanted him fired. They said he was destroying Apple
[01:12.320 --> 01:18.420]  They kept comparing him to Steve Jobs in a very negative way and looking back at an eyesight. It's absolutely ridiculous
[01:18.800 --> 01:20.800]  Yeah, I was just thinking that
[01:20.800 --> 01:26.000]  Before we started recording. I was thinking that I don't think anybody called for that in 2014
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.960]  But at least in 2013 you can find several instances of ostensibly serious
[01:32.200 --> 01:39.120]  business writers calling either for Tim Cook to be outright fired or at least calling for Apple's board to like
[01:39.480 --> 01:42.200]  Rain him in and and have him rejigger the company
[01:42.760 --> 01:48.360]  We did have haunted Empire. I think earlier this year which sort of showed that Apple was completely doomed without Steve Jobs
[01:48.360 --> 01:53.080]  Yeah, I think it's I think that's sort of the publication of haunted Empire
[01:55.480 --> 02:01.300]  Her first name her last name is Kane. Yeah, you could you could Tori. Yeah, you could Tori Kane
[02:01.960 --> 02:08.760]  Sure, I would say that the publication of her book haunted Empire was sort of the I was gonna say high-water mark
[02:08.760 --> 02:13.360]  But I would say maybe the low watermark of Apple nay saying yeah
[02:14.760 --> 02:16.760]  When did that come in that was probably February
[02:16.760 --> 02:22.520]  Yeah, it must it was when I was with Jason Snell, which means it had to be around Macworld time or something
[02:22.520 --> 02:25.480]  Yeah, which was I think February. Yeah last year
[02:27.600 --> 02:33.800]  Yeah, and I could not help but get the feeling when I read it that it was rushed into publication
[02:34.760 --> 02:39.280]  because I kind of felt like at least if she didn't know at least her the
[02:39.800 --> 02:41.800]  editorial team at her publisher
[02:41.800 --> 02:48.880]  Sort of got the sense that that the time was kicking on that sort of doom and gloom which was interesting because you could probably
[02:48.960 --> 02:50.800]  Make an argument
[02:50.800 --> 02:53.400]  For a haunted Empire, but they didn't even make an attempt to make it
[02:53.400 --> 02:56.760]  It was a bunch of pages strung together and nothing resembling a book
[02:57.360 --> 03:00.480]  Yeah, and a bunch of a couple of anecdotes to string it together
[03:00.600 --> 03:01.120]  Yeah
[03:01.120 --> 03:06.840]  I do think though like if there is I think it was a very bad book and I think it's already
[03:07.040 --> 03:10.520]  Showing its age and I think it's only gonna look worse as the years go on
[03:10.520 --> 03:11.840]  but
[03:11.840 --> 03:15.040]  On the other hand, I'm kind of glad the book exists
[03:16.080 --> 03:19.040]  because it captures that sort of
[03:21.560 --> 03:25.200]  Like post Steve Jobs pre Apple watch
[03:25.920 --> 03:27.640]  negative Apple
[03:27.640 --> 03:30.680]  Perspective like and in hindsight, you know, I mean, it's like these years
[03:30.680 --> 03:33.840]  They always blur together and four or five years from now
[03:33.840 --> 03:41.000]  It's like this whole, you know period in between where the Apple watch was announced him when we actually, you know
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.600]  Have it and we have generation two and three by, you know, four or five years from now
[03:45.320 --> 03:47.320]  it'll just you know be a
[03:47.640 --> 03:54.440]  Blink, you know, we'll snap our fingers and think about these this interim period but I feel like her book sort of captures the epitomizes
[03:54.440 --> 03:58.320]  That that sort of negative viewpoint. Yeah, I think that's absolutely true
[03:58.320 --> 04:01.980]  We do tend to look back so the rose-colored glasses like the original iPhone the original iPad
[04:01.980 --> 04:05.760]  They couldn't do anywhere nearly what they could do now, but we still look at them with fondness
[04:05.760 --> 04:10.360]  We think of current software updates as being buggy, but you look back at iOS, you know
[04:10.360 --> 04:15.280]  Two-point something when everyone's complaining it couldn't attach to a 3g network and Apple was rushing out a fix
[04:15.360 --> 04:19.000]  We have this weird sort of affection I think for the past. Yeah
[04:21.520 --> 04:27.880]  So I do I think that's 2014 in a nutshell is that the the the world at large and the conventional wisdom
[04:27.880 --> 04:33.980]  About Apple and about Tim Cook's leadership have caught up to reality which is that the company
[04:34.420 --> 04:40.700]  Was you know, Steve Jobs left the company in very good shape and in very good hands. Yes
[04:41.420 --> 04:48.140]  And it took about two or three years. It seems for the mainstream financial media to sort of concede that point
[04:48.140 --> 04:52.260]  I would say that almost a full three years right because he died in 2011
[04:52.600 --> 04:56.320]  Yes, I would say it was a full three years and Tim Cook
[04:56.320 --> 04:59.300]  I mean the company has never been worth more the stock price is through the roof
[04:59.300 --> 05:03.760]  They've introduced not only the Apple watch but Apple pay they have an a8x processor
[05:03.760 --> 05:08.900]  they have a 5k iMac and you still look at fortune contributor network sometimes and and
[05:09.420 --> 05:11.500]  You just want to know how they get published. Yeah
[05:12.380 --> 05:14.380]  All right, you're in review January
[05:15.700 --> 05:17.700]  Definitely a slow start I think
[05:17.800 --> 05:22.500]  Yeah again for some years. I mean one year we got the Verizon iPhone in January one year
[05:22.500 --> 05:28.540]  We got an education event previous years. We had the introduction of the iPad. We've had macworld the introduction of the iPhone
[05:28.540 --> 05:30.580]  So there was sort of for a long period of time
[05:30.580 --> 05:37.300]  There were events that were there was news in January and I think last year there was nothing until WEC and this year
[05:37.300 --> 05:39.300]  I think it was almost identical to that
[05:40.820 --> 05:42.820]  Yeah, I would say so I
[05:43.100 --> 05:44.820]  Mean there's you know
[05:44.820 --> 05:46.820]  Now that Apple doesn't make
[05:47.220 --> 05:51.260]  Announcements in January or at least they they haven't in recent years. I
[05:51.260 --> 05:55.220]  Mean who knows this year in theory, they might have a watch event, but
[05:56.220 --> 06:00.940]  It's pretty much left to CES which Apple doesn't take part in. Yes
[06:01.700 --> 06:03.900]  for all of the industry news, I
[06:04.540 --> 06:09.700]  Don't recall anything from this year to 2014 CES that ended up
[06:10.660 --> 06:12.300]  mattering a damn bit
[06:12.300 --> 06:16.660]  No, I mean, I think this year will be different just because of home kit and health kit and carplay
[06:16.660 --> 06:23.580]  But last year CES was a graveyard. It was just almost like matrix shelf after matrix shelf of cases and nothing else
[06:23.660 --> 06:27.080]  Yeah, and I don't think they knew what they were going to you know going to
[06:27.640 --> 06:30.740]  The industry as a whole didn't even know what they were trying to make
[06:31.140 --> 06:31.660]  Yeah
[06:31.660 --> 06:36.720]  They were making their fitness bands and I remember one of the worst things I saw at CES wasn't an Android powered
[06:36.860 --> 06:42.580]  Car system and it was running gingerbread and the guy told us with a straight face that you could leave it on for five days
[06:42.580 --> 06:45.940]  But it would drain your car battery. So you had to put it in standby mode
[06:45.940 --> 06:49.700]  But if you put it sorry, but if you turned it off, it would take like five minutes to boot again
[06:50.980 --> 06:53.260]  This was something that they actually had as a press event
[06:55.180 --> 06:57.580]  Are you going to see us again this year? Yeah, absolutely
[06:58.020 --> 07:02.240]  Yeah, what's Dan Fromer who was on the show last week is going for the first time this year
[07:03.500 --> 07:10.380]  And like I said with him, I always talk about going but I've never gone but it's alternatively completely barren or incredibly busy
[07:10.380 --> 07:12.380]  And you never know what's gonna happen year to year
[07:12.380 --> 07:16.680]  So I don't have high faith for it, but I think it I think this year will be different because we will have a watch event
[07:16.680 --> 07:20.520]  Maybe we'll see another Apple television. Maybe a bigger iPad like the spring sounds exciting this year
[07:20.520 --> 07:25.680]  But last year up until up until June it really was everyone just saying where's the new stuff from Apple?
[07:25.680 --> 07:27.680]  Where is the new stuff are they capable of innovating still?
[07:28.240 --> 07:31.880]  Yeah, why we have to wait why do we have to wait for them to be ready for something?
[07:32.240 --> 07:36.520]  Well, that's the thing that I don't understand is do it would anybody have wanted a 2006 iPhone?
[07:36.520 --> 07:36.840]  No
[07:36.840 --> 07:42.840]  2006 iPhone no because it was not a product yet and the Apple watch won't be a product until early next year
[07:42.840 --> 07:44.940]  You don't want them to ship what they have right now
[07:46.240 --> 07:52.580]  Yeah, and it you know to compare and contrast with I think the antithesis of Apple's, you know
[07:52.720 --> 07:58.120]  We'll let you know when we're ready to show you attitude. It's Google, you know who has been
[07:58.640 --> 08:00.840]  You know, Google Glass was clearly
[08:01.480 --> 08:06.020]  Released ahead of its time. I mean, it's still not it still isn't a retail consumer product
[08:06.020 --> 08:10.200]  But the fact that they sold it at all to what did they call the people explorers? Yes
[08:11.240 --> 08:16.680]  You know is is the antithesis of Apple strategy that would be the equivalent of if Apple had let
[08:17.780 --> 08:18.860]  WWDC
[08:18.860 --> 08:26.200]  Explorers start wearing and using an Apple watch, you know 18 months ago running like skank watch software or something, right?
[08:28.120 --> 08:30.120]  And you know the self-driving cars
[08:31.880 --> 08:33.880]  So many things that Google does they show
[08:33.880 --> 08:41.960]  Way early and in some sense I the the the I don't think it's productive and you know
[08:42.200 --> 08:45.200]  Every time I bring it up some people mention that the cars in particular
[08:45.200 --> 08:50.340]  It's impossible to do it without showing your hand because there's no way to road test them
[08:51.280 --> 08:55.400]  You know, you have to road test them in public before you can release them and you know way to keep once
[08:55.400 --> 08:59.240]  It's out in the road. You can't keep it secret. So maybe the self-driving cars is a bit of a
[09:01.480 --> 09:02.920]  Bad example
[09:02.920 --> 09:04.120]  but
[09:04.120 --> 09:09.920]  You know the other products they do they release and I think it I think ultimately it's counterproductive
[09:10.280 --> 09:14.480]  Because I think it saps away excitement from the real things
[09:14.480 --> 09:20.800]  you're actually have available to sell to people but on the other hand it absolutely works to
[09:22.660 --> 09:29.440]  Satisfy the desires of the tech press as as as an industry because they you're giving them something to write about
[09:29.440 --> 09:32.240]  Yeah, I think that's exactly I think for the tech press
[09:33.020 --> 09:34.320]  Perception really is reality
[09:34.320 --> 09:37.980]  So if we see a demo of the moto 240 or 360 or whatever it is
[09:38.280 --> 09:43.800]  Even though it's not real even though leaving a screen like that on like what they showed in the video is a complete science fiction
[09:44.000 --> 09:50.120]  fantasy it sets expectations for that and it makes people think that Google's really busy and that product is coming and they're innovating and
[09:50.120 --> 09:54.200]  They're doing all these things and if it comes out in some cases, you know, it's a complete turd
[09:54.320 --> 09:57.180]  But everyone's already seen the video the excitement's already happened
[09:57.180 --> 10:01.640]  And then everything else from then on is it his appointment even things made by Apple or another company?
[10:02.320 --> 10:07.680]  Yeah, it's I think moltz has said it best where he's you know, I think it's moltz
[10:07.680 --> 10:12.160]  but one of his lines is that you know, Apple's current products continue to
[10:12.600 --> 10:18.000]  Fail when compared to the upcoming products in future years from its competitors
[10:18.520 --> 10:20.840]  It's like the iPhone 5c was a huge disappointment
[10:20.840 --> 10:26.720]  Even though it was the third most popular phone in the world and the iPad sales are lagging even though they're any company in the
[10:26.720 --> 10:31.960]  World would be happy to have that in their product line. Yeah or another example. I just noticed this week and it's funny
[10:31.960 --> 10:33.960]  I haven't linked it up yet, but
[10:34.160 --> 10:37.360]  The same day or within 24 hours
[10:37.800 --> 10:45.360]  There was a New York Times story about the success of Apple pay and about a whole bunch of nude retailers who've signed up for it
[10:47.640 --> 10:52.720]  Some big supermarket chains like Winn-dixie, which is real big in the south here in the US I
[10:52.720 --> 10:56.560]  I forget who else but some big big-name retailers have signed up
[10:57.400 --> 10:59.400]  and
[10:59.480 --> 11:03.240]  Companies like Whole Foods who've been on board since it started who said that it's you know
[11:03.240 --> 11:07.800]  It accounts for over 1% of their transactions and an enormous percent of you know
[11:07.800 --> 11:11.700]  The digital transactions or what would you call it cardless transactions?
[11:13.360 --> 11:20.360]  And at the same time there were like three or four stories that I saw all based on the same analyst report about what what
[11:20.360 --> 11:24.800]  What what trouble Apple pay is in because they've woken up
[11:25.680 --> 11:30.720]  The MCX partners and really gotten the MCX partners to really want to do a good job
[11:30.720 --> 11:35.520]  And so now Apple pays in trouble because MCX is is still coming
[11:36.320 --> 11:39.800]  It's reminds me that article. I think it was two weeks ago where someone said Apple pay
[11:40.280 --> 11:47.360]  probably another one of the Forbes contributor networks that Apple pay was a huge disappointment because it was only responsible for a very small amount of
[11:47.360 --> 11:52.640]  Transactions worldwide never mind America didn't have a much of equipment for it and it was only available in America
[11:52.640 --> 11:58.280]  Which which is far behind in terms of NFC. It's amazing what perspective they can bring to it when they try hard enough to put
[11:58.280 --> 11:59.760]  It in a bad light
[11:59.760 --> 12:05.800]  Right that there's no other digital, you know pay with your phone transaction retail thing
[12:05.800 --> 12:12.520]  That's even close to as popular as Apple pay but somehow it's a failure because it's still only 1% of the market, you know
[12:12.520 --> 12:19.560]  Two months in yeah in one country or not even two months, right? It didn't even launch until November. Yeah, I think right
[12:20.080 --> 12:26.240]  October I think it came with iOS 8.1. All right. Well still that's a you know, right about two months. Yep, two months
[12:28.720 --> 12:32.600]  And it's crazy to me too that
[12:35.520 --> 12:37.520]  With the MCX that
[12:37.560 --> 12:40.600]  They don't mention the people who you know who want to promote it
[12:40.600 --> 12:45.320]  Which I think I think it's not because they actually believe it. I think it's even though they're analysts rather than press
[12:45.320 --> 12:47.160]  I think it's this this
[12:47.160 --> 12:52.920]  Idea that you want to present everything as a neck-and-neck battle, right?
[12:54.200 --> 13:01.200]  You know and so Apple pay is threatened by MCX because it's gonna be backed by Walmart and whoever else and they have you know
[13:01.200 --> 13:03.400]  huge huge footprint in retail
[13:04.680 --> 13:06.680]  But they just skip over
[13:06.680 --> 13:10.520]  the most obvious aspects of what has made Apple pay
[13:11.640 --> 13:12.800]  successful
[13:12.800 --> 13:14.560]  which is
[13:14.560 --> 13:18.640]  exactly what Tim Cook said on stage when he introduced it, which is
[13:19.800 --> 13:25.340]  You know, it's one of like my biggest recurring mantras about Apple is don't underestimate how often
[13:26.040 --> 13:28.880]  They're not giving you any spin any bullshit
[13:28.880 --> 13:34.760]  They're just telling you flat-out in plain language exactly why they did what they did and without will be
[13:34.760 --> 13:35.860]  a
[13:35.860 --> 13:40.740]  Tim Cook's explanation was we think everybody else who's tried this to date has failed because they haven't
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.420]  Concentrated on the user experience and made that their priority. That's what we've done
[13:45.620 --> 13:48.780]  we've made it as easy as possible to use as
[13:49.760 --> 13:55.620]  Quick to use and as privacy protecting as we can all in the name of the user
[13:57.860 --> 14:03.260]  You know and if that's all they did well then who you know what retailer would hook up the equipment
[14:03.260 --> 14:08.260]  But the other things they did secondary to the user focus is use the established
[14:09.300 --> 14:11.300]  infrastructure for NFC payments and
[14:12.100 --> 14:17.380]  Make the banks happy by taking a very minimal cut and by promising
[14:18.140 --> 14:20.140]  significantly increased security
[14:21.720 --> 14:26.380]  Which gets the banks on board because the banks can do the math and I really do think it works out
[14:26.380 --> 14:28.380]  Which is that Apple's little?
[14:28.380 --> 14:34.900]  zero point one five percent cut of the transactions is less than the cost of fraud per
[14:35.580 --> 14:37.580]  transaction that the banks have been used to I
[14:37.860 --> 14:39.180]  Think that's absolutely true
[14:39.180 --> 14:43.860]  Especially when you look at and the the privacy and the security to when you look at all the data breaches at the targets or the
[14:43.860 --> 14:47.860]  Home depots, but I think you nailed it when you said it it's aligned with my interests
[14:47.860 --> 14:50.020]  I've gone to Apple pay terminals, you know
[14:50.020 --> 14:54.580]  Even the demo one set up at Apple when we're at the event and they read my Canadian NFC credit card
[14:54.580 --> 14:59.640]  It that technology is not going to just benefit Apple's gonna benefit everybody who uses any sort of NFC
[15:00.220 --> 15:06.760]  Transaction and you compare that to current car currency or whatever it's called and that you have to give the retailer your bank account
[15:06.760 --> 15:07.860]  You have to have a QR code
[15:07.860 --> 15:13.380]  You have to scan the QR code and though it is such a horrible experience and it's not done to the benefit of the consumer
[15:13.380 --> 15:17.140]  It's done to try to increase the amount of to save money on transactions
[15:17.140 --> 15:18.380]  They pay the credit card companies
[15:18.380 --> 15:19.140]  Never mind
[15:19.140 --> 15:22.220]  How long it's gonna how much money is gonna cost them in terms of cashiers fees?
[15:22.220 --> 15:25.900]  For the incredibly complicated error prone system that they're establishing, right?
[15:25.900 --> 15:30.600]  You can't prove yet that Tim Cook's explanation for you know
[15:30.600 --> 15:37.720]  Why they thought Apple pay would be successful and why it seems to be successful today are true and that cut
[15:37.720 --> 15:44.860]  You know that a user focused approach is is the way to get it done and who knows maybe something like currency
[15:44.860 --> 15:47.620]  Will also become popular. I
[15:47.620 --> 15:52.540]  Don't I don't know I have my doubts about currency in particular, but you know
[15:52.540 --> 15:58.300]  It could be that something that's a lot more retailer friendly as opposed to consumer friendly could work
[15:58.620 --> 16:02.660]  But the evidence to date suggests, you know that what Apple said was exactly right
[16:03.460 --> 16:05.460]  It's it's also
[16:06.060 --> 16:08.820]  What benefits the retailer is is interesting because?
[16:09.440 --> 16:15.700]  Me getting through the checkout line really quickly benefits the retailer and I believe it's my understanding that a lot of they signed multi-year
[16:15.700 --> 16:20.860]  Agreements with currency and with MCX when they started which was a silly thing to do, but they did it
[16:20.860 --> 16:24.460]  But I believe a lot of those expire pretty early on this year and it'll be interesting
[16:24.460 --> 16:24.980]  Sorry, not this year
[16:24.980 --> 16:30.020]  but in 2015 and it'll be interesting to see how many of those adopt Apple pay as soon as they are contractually allowed to
[16:31.340 --> 16:32.780]  and
[16:32.780 --> 16:39.340]  The other thing that I keep thinking about as a technical limitation is the way that there's one thing that Apple pay has that no
[16:39.340 --> 16:40.840]  other
[16:40.840 --> 16:43.420]  Payment system that would work on the iPhone at least
[16:43.420 --> 16:48.500]  I mean obviously like what Google could enable on Android or Microsoft with Windows Phone is different
[16:48.500 --> 16:54.060]  But at least if you want iPhone using customers the one thing they have that nobody else can do
[16:54.740 --> 16:59.220]  Is the way that it works at the system level rather than the app level?
[16:59.380 --> 17:04.580]  like and I just can't emphasize enough for anybody out there who hasn't used Apple pay yet because you don't have a
[17:05.060 --> 17:09.880]  iPhone 6 or because you don't shop at one of the places that that supports it yet
[17:09.880 --> 17:14.440]  but I just can't emphasize enough how how how
[17:15.240 --> 17:17.880]  Instead of like feeling like a one-step process
[17:17.880 --> 17:22.480]  It almost feels like a zero step process because you don't have to unlock your phone
[17:22.480 --> 17:27.880]  You just take the phone even if it's not on and just get it within an inch of the terminal
[17:28.160 --> 17:32.320]  Put your rest your thumb on the on the reader and it's that's it
[17:33.080 --> 17:35.800]  It's like nobody else can do that
[17:35.800 --> 17:41.760]  like you if a current see app on the iPhone you would have to unlock your phone open the app and
[17:44.160 --> 17:50.040]  Go from there, which is you know, it doesn't sound like a lot but compared to Apple pay it is a lot I
[17:50.720 --> 17:52.520]  Get upset I most places here
[17:52.520 --> 17:56.120]  I can just tap my card and go and when it doesn't work you feel like an animal having to you know
[17:56.120 --> 18:00.200]  Put it in and put in a pin goat or or swipe it and I haven't had a swipe or sign something in the in
[18:00.200 --> 18:01.680]  over a year
[18:01.680 --> 18:04.000]  But it reminds me of something else and it's a bit of a tangent
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.360]  But I think I think it's the same thing. It's it's all goes back to Apple making like the a8
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.480]  Chipset or the 8x chipset in that you take the cameras for instance. I take out my iPhone
[18:13.480 --> 18:15.640]  I can just take a picture and all nine out of ten times
[18:15.640 --> 18:22.520]  It's gonna be a perfect a really good everyday picture and that's because Apple makes their own image signal processor when you look at
[18:22.920 --> 18:24.600]  Microsoft who buys off-the-shelf chips
[18:24.600 --> 18:29.240]  They have to put really big glass on the front and collect as much light as they can because they're using custom
[18:29.240 --> 18:31.760]  They're using off-the-shelf chips. There's no advantage to them
[18:31.760 --> 18:35.080]  They're Google has no idea what hardware or what software is running on their phones
[18:35.080 --> 18:37.560]  They try to suck it up to the server and do all the auto awesome stuff
[18:37.560 --> 18:41.020]  But Apple is just making sure that they have a good camera on it
[18:41.020 --> 18:45.080]  They'll process it and almost any shot you take will be useful for a normal person
[18:45.080 --> 18:46.760]  And this that's the same thing
[18:46.760 --> 18:52.120]  You can't get that advantage unless you own the entire stack the way that they do and now they're moving that into payments and then
[18:52.120 --> 18:56.120]  Moving that into other areas with the iPhone. Yeah. No, you can't underestimate the
[18:56.120 --> 19:01.120]  The advantage that they and I think it totally gets written off by these
[19:01.760 --> 19:06.920]  Naysaying analysts what an advantage Apple has by controlling that level of the stack
[19:06.920 --> 19:11.780]  I used to think they were naysaying and I have I have a friend who was a sell-side analyst and he explained it to me
[19:11.780 --> 19:17.420]  And it's that the press reports analyst as though they're giving comments to readers and their comments are not meant for their readers
[19:17.420 --> 19:21.520]  They're meant to manipulate the markets and what they say is very little to do with what they believe it
[19:21.520 --> 19:26.200]  It's entirely they probably told their own clients something different two days ago or three days ago
[19:26.200 --> 19:30.360]  And now they want to produce results for them. So it's so undependable. I don't know why it gets reported
[19:31.080 --> 19:38.560]  Right like an analyst who comes out with a report that seems to be very pessimistic about Apple pays long-term prospects might in fact
[19:39.080 --> 19:45.920]  Honestly privately in terms of where he's putting money and advising his clients to put money being very bullish on the future of Apple pay
[19:46.120 --> 19:50.840]  It's like that video with crane from a couple years ago where he says you want to make money you you spread a rumor saying
[19:50.840 --> 19:52.960]  The iPhone is gonna be delayed you call up the news networks
[19:52.960 --> 19:56.480]  You tell them it's gonna be delayed then all of a sudden apples down and you've shorted all the shares
[19:56.480 --> 20:01.340]  I think that happens a lot. Yeah, what was that guy's name? Jim Cramer? Yeah, Jim Cramer. That's it
[20:02.880 --> 20:07.580]  It's baffling but and again this stuff keeps getting reported as though it's factual accounting on what Apple's doing
[20:10.900 --> 20:12.900]  What else in the first half of the year I
[20:14.240 --> 20:17.920]  Think there was it was Angela. I think Angela errands was in early on in the year
[20:17.920 --> 20:23.440]  Yeah, I do think so. When was she definitely February March?
[20:23.800 --> 20:27.720]  Yeah, that's a complete turnaround from John Broward from the previous year
[20:27.720 --> 20:32.400]  Yeah, and I think that's super interesting because Apple is really doing well in Apple stores
[20:32.400 --> 20:36.900]  But some people some people will say that it's a stale experience that they haven't evolved it even though it's working
[20:36.900 --> 20:42.000]  It's hugely successful, but they gave her not only Apple retail but Apple online as well
[20:42.000 --> 20:48.920]  Which used to operate almost as separate businesses and it's similar to giving Federiki control over both OS 10 and iOS and that those
[20:49.200 --> 20:54.080]  Those sort of artificial walls are falling down and it's providing better service for everybody involved
[20:54.440 --> 21:01.100]  So Angela aren't the her hiring was announced a year ago in October 2013
[21:01.100 --> 21:05.320]  but she did not start until I believe February or March of
[21:06.320 --> 21:09.680]  2014 I've said this before but and it seems obvious
[21:09.680 --> 21:16.440]  But it's so clear to me that the reason why why they hired her and why she would take the job is because of the watch
[21:16.840 --> 21:17.880]  Yes
[21:17.880 --> 21:20.040]  Well, she was a CEO of Burberry
[21:20.040 --> 21:23.800]  That's a huge job and people didn't understand why she would become a senior vice president at Apple
[21:23.800 --> 21:28.560]  Even though the senior vice president of retail and on and then now online as well as a huge job
[21:28.560 --> 21:33.200]  It's a it's like being a CEO of another company, but it's still I think you're exactly right Apple
[21:33.660 --> 21:37.000]  Apple dangled something in front of her that was a challenge and people like that want a challenge
[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  Yeah, totally
[21:40.360 --> 21:47.080]  And it does seem it seems, you know, it's not like we haven't really seen the arts effect on anything in retail yet
[21:47.600 --> 21:51.480]  But I don't think there's anybody who doesn't think that that's coming. Yeah
[21:52.240 --> 21:54.240]  you know, I think that there's
[21:54.600 --> 21:58.440]  half of it I think is that changes like that take a lot of time because
[21:59.240 --> 22:03.960]  It or not a lot of time but a lot of time compared to our industry, right?
[22:03.960 --> 22:09.080]  because you can't do it digitally you can't just you know have a new store and
[22:09.880 --> 22:14.560]  You know, you know like they do with the online store put up a sticky note for 15 minutes
[22:14.560 --> 22:21.160]  And then when you come back, it's an all-new store, you know, this brick-and-mortar stuff takes visit, you know actual time and
[22:21.960 --> 22:27.520]  You know to take a store down and put it back up is time when you're not to making sales
[22:28.320 --> 22:29.920]  You know so like in San Francisco
[22:29.920 --> 22:34.360]  I don't know if the new store is open yet, but they're not putting the new store on the same spot as the old store
[22:34.360 --> 22:36.760]  They're putting it like on the other corner around
[22:37.840 --> 22:39.960]  What's the name of that part Union Square? Yep?
[22:42.240 --> 22:47.960]  You know and you can't do that everywhere where Apple has a retail store, you know, most of the ones that are in
[22:48.680 --> 22:50.000]  shopping malls
[22:50.000 --> 22:56.880]  You could I guess get another spot in the mall, but who knows if there's one, you know, it all depends on availability
[22:56.880 --> 23:00.080]  That's outside the control of Apple and they're not like a carrier company
[23:00.080 --> 23:04.200]  It was gonna just put a little kiosk out front while the store is closed behind it. All right, exactly
[23:07.640 --> 23:12.680]  Yeah, I think you're right I think as the watch starts to deploy into the stores and as the other products are coming online for
[23:12.680 --> 23:17.360]  Next year, we're gonna see the stores sort of transform today. I don't know if fashion is the right words
[23:17.360 --> 23:20.480]  I think Apple is doing something really interesting where technology is meeting fashion
[23:20.480 --> 23:24.360]  But it's gonna be an Apple store that that has to be different than it was in the past
[23:24.360 --> 23:27.840]  Yeah, let me see anything else. I don't really see these ones
[23:28.480 --> 23:32.760]  Beats I think was announced earlier on in the year because they had Dre on the stage for WBC
[23:32.760 --> 23:39.640]  So it must have been May 2014 Apple to acquire music beats music and beats electronics. I
[23:40.480 --> 23:42.040]  it's I
[23:42.040 --> 23:46.800]  Don't know that that's major news, but it's because it's not a huge
[23:46.800 --> 23:50.280]  It's a it's a much bigger transaction than Apple has made
[23:50.280 --> 23:56.840]  You know famously, you know, it's the biggest acquisition since they acquired next which of course, you know
[23:57.400 --> 24:01.420]  Is the you know turned into like the backbone of the country of the company?
[24:03.000 --> 24:04.260]  But
[24:04.260 --> 24:11.000]  You know a 500 million dollar acquisition in 1997 was less was seriously about the company acquisition
[24:11.360 --> 24:17.680]  Whereas a you know, three billion or whatever it cost acquisition to get beats is pocket change
[24:17.680 --> 24:20.860]  Absolutely. Yeah three hundred billion three billion dollars
[24:21.480 --> 24:24.960]  You know, I mean you don't want to make a three billion dollar acquisition
[24:24.960 --> 24:30.320]  That doesn't turn out well, but it certainly isn't gonna have any meaningful if it turns out to be a complete bust
[24:30.320 --> 24:31.880]  It's not gonna hurt the company
[24:31.880 --> 24:37.200]  I think more interesting than the beats acquisition was just the reactions to it from it was almost like everyone went through the the five
[24:37.200 --> 24:43.640]  Stages of grief with denial and anger and they just couldn't believe it and it turns out it does make some sense
[24:43.640 --> 24:49.680]  There are you know selling headphones at Apple stores makes a lot of sense and sort of a synergy between iTunes radio and beats music
[24:49.680 --> 24:51.680]  Whatever it ends up being labeled makes a lot of sense
[24:52.440 --> 24:54.440]  yeah, and I think I
[24:56.040 --> 24:59.200]  Don't know I I still don't think overall it makes ton of sense
[24:59.200 --> 25:03.440]  I'm still waiting for the other shoe to drop on it, but it's in some sense
[25:03.440 --> 25:07.680]  It does where it's the only other iconic headphone company I can think of
[25:07.680 --> 25:11.880]  I mean it has nothing to do with you know, Marco Arment style
[25:11.880 --> 25:13.880]  Quality
[25:14.320 --> 25:21.480]  Analysis but rather you're out on the sidewalk and you see somebody walking while they're listening to their device and you know
[25:21.480 --> 25:26.400]  Those white earbuds that Apple's been making ever since 2001 are truly iconic
[25:26.400 --> 25:33.280]  I mean they even had for years an ad campaign that was kind of based on that right with the silhouettes dancing silhouettes
[25:33.640 --> 25:37.360]  Who you know have white earbuds and a white why?
[25:37.360 --> 25:42.840]  You know connector draped around their body. They own that right?
[25:42.840 --> 25:46.840]  Not that other companies had you know that they have a trademark on it and nobody can make white earbuds
[25:46.840 --> 25:48.960]  But white earbuds people see them
[25:48.960 --> 25:54.920]  They think that's somebody listening to an Apple device and beats is the only other company I can think of that has that sort of
[25:55.320 --> 26:00.560]  Recognition. Yeah, they have that the other cache that the iPod commercials used to have right ten years ago
[26:00.840 --> 26:02.960]  But I think there's also an element to any cues
[26:02.960 --> 26:07.760]  Organization is just so big and there's gonna be a limit at some point to what he can do and he's doing Apple pay now
[26:07.760 --> 26:12.200]  As well, he does the App Store and the iTunes store and he does all the contract negotiations
[26:12.200 --> 26:18.600]  And if you could have Jimmy Iovine in there doing at least some of that it takes more stuff off of any cues desk
[26:18.600 --> 26:22.400]  Yeah something I've heard and it you know, I don't think this is surprising
[26:22.400 --> 26:24.640]  That's probably what everybody was guessing anyway
[26:24.640 --> 26:33.400]  But what I have heard recently was that at least inside Apple the beats acquisition is viewed as an Eddie thing that Eddie
[26:33.400 --> 26:40.820]  Eddie Eddie started it and he pushed for it Eddie drove it and not that that Tim Cook wasn't engaged and I'm sure that at
[26:40.820 --> 26:45.880]  The negotiation level he was in fact deeply engaged. I mean, I don't think you know, Tim Cook has not
[26:46.680 --> 26:48.960]  Don't worry about the details sort of CEO
[26:48.960 --> 26:53.600]  So not to diminish what Tim Cook's role in the negotiations might have been but in terms of
[26:54.800 --> 26:56.800]  Advocating it and and you know
[26:57.760 --> 27:00.560]  Pushing for it. It was in almost entirely an eddy cue thing
[27:01.200 --> 27:06.320]  It's interesting cuz we didn't see anything about iTunes this year. We didn't see continuity for iTunes. For example
[27:06.320 --> 27:11.920]  We didn't see a new iTunes music service iTunes radio still hasn't gone past the u.s. And Australia
[27:11.920 --> 27:17.200]  I think and iTunes is an aging platform. It's still based on web objects. It's still playing on the internet
[27:17.200 --> 27:20.400]  Form is still based on web objects is still based on their original software
[27:20.400 --> 27:24.440]  They used to manage, you know, the music store and all of that at some point, you know
[27:24.440 --> 27:28.360]  It's gonna be like a John, Syracuse a thing where a thousand years from now. This is gonna have to be fixed
[27:28.360 --> 27:30.760]  So what's the point between now and then that it actually gets fixed?
[27:30.760 --> 27:36.220]  and I don't know if beats has better software or a better solution, but it could also be a catalyst to Apple finally fixing a
[27:36.220 --> 27:37.760]  lot of the
[27:37.760 --> 27:41.880]  Infrastructure things that they have to do with the iTunes store. Yeah, I think you know
[27:41.880 --> 27:47.280]  Oh above and beyond whether it's based on web objects behind the scenes and and all of that
[27:47.280 --> 27:53.560]  I think it's ever more clear that it's based on a model that just isn't relevant anymore
[27:55.160 --> 28:02.600]  Which is here's a song you want and you give a retailer money for it and now you own a copy of it
[28:02.760 --> 28:08.280]  That's it's just not that's just that's done. I mean, I'm not done not done in the sense of
[28:08.280 --> 28:15.680]  They're not selling any songs anymore, but that I can't see any way that that ever comes back
[28:16.040 --> 28:23.120]  Yes, it's it's in permanent decline. It's sort of like what like what standalone iPods are, you know
[28:23.240 --> 28:29.040]  It's you know still a decent business, but it's it's never going to increase quarter over quarter
[28:29.040 --> 28:31.320]  It's just going to go into permanent decline
[28:31.800 --> 28:37.680]  Yeah, and just like the iPod is being replaced by the iPhone in some cases the iPad mini and now larger iPhones
[28:37.680 --> 28:43.560]  it makes sense for whatever iTunes was for Apple to get in early enough to have whatever iTunes will end up being right and it's
[28:43.560 --> 28:45.600]  Yeah, and in the same way that it you know
[28:45.600 --> 28:53.260]  iPods sales decreasing doesn't mean that people are spending less time with gadgets that play music in the same way
[28:53.400 --> 29:00.480]  Music sales declining doesn't mean people are spending less time listening to music. If anything, they're probably spending more, you know
[29:00.480 --> 29:04.180]  I think I wouldn't be surprised if you did a study and found out that people listen to more music
[29:04.180 --> 29:08.020]  Today or at least time spent listening to music than ever before
[29:08.660 --> 29:15.180]  It's just that the model is no longer buying and selling. Yeah, it's not it's not what you had to buy it
[29:15.180 --> 29:18.900]  It's not we had to wait in the radio people can get pretty much what they want when they want and that opens them up
[29:18.900 --> 29:21.160]  To just consuming it almost non-stop if they want to
[29:22.180 --> 29:24.180]  right
[29:25.260 --> 29:31.060]  So, I don't know I'm still not sure what to make of that if is the beats thing an exception to the rule just
[29:31.060 --> 29:38.720]  just because it is it it combines two things that Apple wants to continue being a leader at which is
[29:39.620 --> 29:41.660]  music listening hardware and
[29:44.220 --> 29:46.220]  Digital distribution of legal music
[29:46.900 --> 29:50.660]  Is it just that beats is like a rare perfect storm?
[29:50.700 --> 29:56.540]  You know acquisition or is it the sign of things to come that Apple is going to loosen up and become?
[29:56.960 --> 29:59.160]  You know a company that does
[29:59.160 --> 30:00.240]  Is
[30:00.240 --> 30:05.840]  Mid level or to high level acquisitions with some frequency. I think again to your point about Apple
[30:05.840 --> 30:09.660]  Just saying what they really feel. I think when Tim Cook says they're not religiously opposed to big acquisitions
[30:09.660 --> 30:11.820]  I think he's absolutely sincere about that
[30:11.820 --> 30:13.040]  They'll do them when they make sense
[30:13.040 --> 30:16.400]  But it's got to be something like beats where it gives them a hardware product
[30:16.400 --> 30:19.040]  They can sell the compliments and other hardware product a service
[30:19.040 --> 30:23.500]  They can roll out the compliments an existing service and has executives that might be able to you know
[30:24.040 --> 30:24.600]  Service it
[30:24.600 --> 30:28.520]  Sorry executives and a culture that can integrate into Apple and help them do the things that they want to do
[30:28.520 --> 30:31.600]  All right, and it doesn't really that's the thing that has me
[30:32.480 --> 30:37.400]  I'm still curious about it, but it doesn't make me worried about it the way that there's
[30:38.280 --> 30:40.040]  any number of other
[30:40.040 --> 30:42.040]  possible three billion dollar ish
[30:42.600 --> 30:46.840]  Acquisitions that Apple could have made that would raise my spidey sense
[30:46.960 --> 30:47.440]  Yeah
[30:47.440 --> 30:54.160]  You know in a way that beats doesn't because the biggest thing is that it doesn't fundamentally change any of the areas of focus in
[30:54.520 --> 30:55.760]  Apple's
[30:55.760 --> 31:02.800]  attention still about week with former it doesn't make them a conglomerate right which is exactly what you know to me is like the
[31:03.080 --> 31:09.160]  The first canary I check in the coal mine is is Apple losing focus and becoming more of a conglomerate
[31:09.160 --> 31:11.040]  Which I you know, we don't know
[31:11.040 --> 31:17.400]  I mean, I don't say that I don't say that Apple becoming a multi focused conglomerate would be bad
[31:17.400 --> 31:21.000]  we just have no idea and there's no history for Apple as
[31:21.640 --> 31:23.640]  a you know
[31:23.640 --> 31:28.880]  Whatever their revenue is, you know 50 or 200 billion dollar a year corporation
[31:28.880 --> 31:34.240]  I mean, you know, they're an uncharted territory period there's you know, they're the most valuable company not just in tech but anywhere
[31:36.640 --> 31:41.360]  But it would be so it wouldn't be you know them making seemingly
[31:41.880 --> 31:47.400]  Unfocused acquisitions wouldn't make me sure that they were on the wrong track
[31:47.560 --> 31:51.040]  But it would make me strongly suspect that they were on the wrong track
[31:51.040 --> 31:55.080]  Yeah, and it's wonder how the analysts would treat it because it wouldn't be expected behavior
[31:55.080 --> 31:58.860]  Google can compete with everybody they can compete with Amazon with Apple with
[31:58.920 --> 32:04.120]  Microsoft with any tech company in the world and do it all at the same time and that's fine and interesting and wonderful
[32:04.840 --> 32:08.920]  But you'd probably you place your howls all the way across the valley if Apple started doing that
[32:08.920 --> 32:12.000]  Yeah, well and Google can compete with itself, you know
[32:12.440 --> 32:19.600]  You know Chromebooks versus Android tablets is a perfect example and I don't even say that that's a mistake
[32:19.600 --> 32:23.560]  I think it kind of fits with Google's internal culture. Whereas if
[32:24.280 --> 32:26.040]  Apple had
[32:26.040 --> 32:27.440]  seemingly
[32:27.440 --> 32:28.960]  confusing
[32:28.960 --> 32:34.920]  Overlap between low-end MacBooks and iPads. I I would find that worrisome
[32:35.040 --> 32:38.320]  Yeah agreed like if Apple had a 399
[32:39.320 --> 32:40.560]  MacBook
[32:40.560 --> 32:42.520]  That would to me would be very worrisome
[32:42.520 --> 32:48.840]  I still have in the back of my head this idea that Google's bought Android because they were panicked about mobile and then saw web OS
[32:48.840 --> 32:52.720]  And smack their head and thought that was a way more Google product than buying Android
[32:52.720 --> 32:55.440]  But but then they were all in on Android and now they're slowly gonna
[32:55.680 --> 32:59.660]  It's fun to get a way to get Chrome OS to a point where that can be their version of web OS
[33:00.560 --> 33:04.000]  That's an interesting. That's an interesting argument too because they ended up hiring
[33:04.640 --> 33:06.760]  Matta Mattias Duarte. Yep
[33:07.560 --> 33:09.560]  Did I get his name, right? Yeah, absolutely
[33:10.280 --> 33:15.200]  Who was the you know lead designer behind web OS? Yeah
[33:15.200 --> 33:20.440]  And they're slowly giving Sundar Pichai control over the stack and he was you know
[33:20.440 --> 33:21.120]  He's the web guy
[33:21.120 --> 33:25.960]  He's Android always seemed like an odd product from Google because it's a web company and that was very native software
[33:26.160 --> 33:32.140]  Yeah, and I really do think that that it took a long time for Google or for Android. I should say to
[33:35.040 --> 33:39.880]  Not to not at the low end but at the sort of mid to high end to get any sort of foothold is that
[33:39.880 --> 33:43.480]  They were in such a deep hole design wise, you know
[33:43.480 --> 33:46.360]  It compared to the iPhone that any you know
[33:46.800 --> 33:48.320]  even people who
[33:48.320 --> 33:54.420]  Were inclined not to buy Apple stuff people who haven't ever bought Apple stuff and sort of want to you know
[33:54.420 --> 33:57.880]  It's a natural thing, you know people who've been sticking with the PC for years
[33:58.600 --> 34:00.600]  and sort of having
[34:01.040 --> 34:03.960]  Apple is for other people sort of mindset about the company
[34:05.220 --> 34:06.480]  you know in
[34:06.480 --> 34:11.360]  2011 even through 2012 you go into a store and compare the Android phones to
[34:11.360 --> 34:17.800]  iPhone and it's you know, you don't even have to be a design critic you just see that there's a serious difference in
[34:18.520 --> 34:24.080]  Fit and finish in the software. It was a very different priority Apple famously wanted to get you know
[34:24.080 --> 34:27.560]  That the animation just absolutely nailed even in the first generation iPhone
[34:27.560 --> 34:30.800]  But they didn't they didn't need to have every single feature crammed in there where?
[34:31.040 --> 34:34.000]  Android was it wasn't designed to be a phone for everybody
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.140]  It was designed to be a phone that would protect Google's
[34:36.140 --> 34:42.460]  Share of the web because they rightly believe web was moving mobile and their priority wasn't that sort of interactivity
[34:42.460 --> 34:48.420]  They wanted to get they bought, you know Android and they made it work, but I remember even last year at CES
[34:48.420 --> 34:50.800]  I was sitting there with the Nexus 4 or 5
[34:51.100 --> 34:54.500]  trying to use Gmail and just cursing out loud and Brian Klug from
[34:54.700 --> 34:56.500]  formerly of an antac came over and
[34:56.500 --> 35:02.060]  Quickly put it in developer mode and the screen went bright red and he said that's because they're redrawing every cell four or five
[35:02.060 --> 35:07.340]  Times trying to hope that it would stick and it's just and their graphics their own graphics engineers couldn't get their own
[35:07.740 --> 35:10.140]  Gmail engineers to properly code all of it
[35:10.140 --> 35:15.260]  I think that's why they've really locked things down now with material design and and all the new things
[35:15.260 --> 35:21.100]  But it took them four or five years to fix the massive architectural problems that were causing poor interaction
[35:21.100 --> 35:27.160]  Right and the difference with web OS is that web OS right from the get-go it had performance problems because of the whole
[35:27.160 --> 35:32.120]  architecture of building it on top of like a WebKit rendering engine and
[35:33.080 --> 35:35.080]  combined with the
[35:35.360 --> 35:37.920]  state of mobile hardware in
[35:38.560 --> 35:42.200]  What was it 2009 when when when the pre came out? Yeah
[35:43.760 --> 35:48.960]  But I you know in terms of an an elegant software interface
[35:48.960 --> 35:51.960]  I mean, I mean you could still it to this day
[35:51.960 --> 35:58.560]  I think you could argue that the way that web OS handled notifications is the best design anybody's come up with absolutely
[35:58.560 --> 36:00.560]  There's synergies. I mean it was almost
[36:00.960 --> 36:06.680]  the fringe universe version of the iPhone if if John Rubenstein had won the keyboard argument or
[36:07.200 --> 36:07.960]  What's his name?
[36:07.960 --> 36:13.520]  It won the the Linux argument or if the people who wanted to use WebKit as the interface instead of creating UI kit had
[36:13.520 --> 36:16.440]  Won that argument that could have been an Apple product, right?
[36:16.440 --> 36:22.440]  Tony said Tony Fidel. Yeah, but instead they all ended up at palm making except for Fidel Rubenstein and and the web
[36:22.440 --> 36:26.640]  What the WebKit engineers ended up at palm making their version of the iPhone? Yeah, absolutely
[36:26.800 --> 36:33.200]  I I if you would have shown if you would have taken a palm pre back in time to
[36:34.200 --> 36:35.520]  You know
[36:35.520 --> 36:36.760]  1998
[36:36.760 --> 36:41.720]  1997 and shown it to my then self and said what come you know, this is a product from 2009
[36:41.720 --> 36:46.720]  What company made it, you know scrub the logos off? I would have guessed Apple. Yeah without question
[36:46.720 --> 36:53.000]  Especially if you just showed me the software and not the hardware the hardware was a lot less appley
[36:53.000 --> 36:57.880]  But the software was extremely appley in my opinion everything from the font choice
[36:58.520 --> 37:06.360]  To you know the roundness, you know, the rounded corners of the screen the rounded corners of the cards on the screen
[37:07.080 --> 37:08.360]  I
[37:08.360 --> 37:13.400]  Think it was a very Apple DNA product software-wise. I've never seen the p1 phone
[37:13.400 --> 37:15.400]  this Fidel's group was working on but in
[37:15.680 --> 37:20.440]  I've always suspected that if that had been the phone that had got the gone ahead of some reason p2 hadn't worked out and
[37:20.960 --> 37:25.800]  Forestalls group hadn't been able to make the iPhone that could have ended up being very similar to what the palm pre was
[37:25.800 --> 37:26.280]  Yeah
[37:26.280 --> 37:33.460]  And so it's interesting to think hypothetically what would have happened if Google had purchased that somehow obtained web OS instead of Android
[37:33.460 --> 37:39.120]  And pushed for it because in some sense the problems that web OS had were I think
[37:39.600 --> 37:46.320]  Not solvable by throwing money at them, but more easily solved by throwing money at that than Android
[37:46.520 --> 37:53.640]  Because with the Android it was to me fundamentally the fact that it was designed at the outset as a sort of blackberry
[37:54.440 --> 38:01.420]  Style, you know that it was gonna you know, a blackberry style mobile interface keyboard up down left right select
[38:01.420 --> 38:03.420]  and
[38:03.460 --> 38:05.220]  Therefore had no
[38:05.220 --> 38:13.500]  No, no at a foundation level aspect of a rich graphical interface with playful animations and high frame
[38:13.500 --> 38:18.820]  Rates and stuff like that. I've told the story before but when I reviewed the g1 the very first Android phone that came out
[38:18.820 --> 38:22.300]  I turned on the snake game and it said press up to start and I tried, you know
[38:22.300 --> 38:24.740]  Swiping up on the screen then I tried pressing the up arrow key
[38:24.740 --> 38:29.220]  Then I tried pressing the up joypad and then I tried pressing up on whatever the other thing was on the other side
[38:29.220 --> 38:32.060]  I tried eight different ways of signaling up and I couldn't get it to work
[38:32.060 --> 38:37.180]  But there were eight different ways of signaling up right and that to me to find the very early years of Android
[38:37.180 --> 38:42.460]  You know, I remember too that it was the only way to select text was to use the up down left, right?
[38:42.460 --> 38:46.220]  There was no way to touch on the screen to select text you had to
[38:46.960 --> 38:48.960]  You know more or less use like arrow keys
[38:49.260 --> 38:54.780]  And the original one you'd close the keyboard and there'd be the juke the Google search box just blinking at you wanting you to put
[38:54.780 --> 38:59.220]  Text, but there was no virtual keyboard so you couldn't input text. I remember that too
[39:00.860 --> 39:06.700]  And that's one of the problems they were facing and and palm was a tiny team and they coded circles around Google when it came
[39:06.700 --> 39:08.700]  to phones in 2009
[39:09.900 --> 39:14.740]  So anyway, that's an interesting what-if it's and to me it's of the last
[39:15.660 --> 39:17.660]  of the of the
[39:17.860 --> 39:23.620]  Post PC era, you know from tooth mid 2007 on the great tragedy of the whole thing
[39:23.620 --> 39:29.340]  Is is that web OS never, you know didn't get a long enough time to try to gain a foothold agreed
[39:29.900 --> 39:35.860]  you know, I mean I I think it was a more elegant design than Windows Phone and
[39:36.380 --> 39:41.640]  So just imagine if they had had somebody with the wherewithal that Microsoft has shown with
[39:42.220 --> 39:47.380]  Windows Phone to stick behind web OS, you know and you know
[39:47.380 --> 39:51.180]  Push the software forward break some of the bottle performance bottlenecks
[39:51.180 --> 39:55.140]  But also just let Moore's law help you out
[39:55.660 --> 40:00.420]  Year after year, you know, two three years later web OS I think would have been a lot more
[40:02.100 --> 40:06.100]  It without even any software optimizations would have been a lot more tenable
[40:06.700 --> 40:13.740]  Performance wise absolutely. They had no secondary source of income Apple had Mac money originally Google had search money even Samsung had appliance money
[40:14.220 --> 40:17.140]  Palm and now blackberry they have no additional sources of income
[40:17.140 --> 40:22.180]  And so everything becomes everything becomes bet the company every phone you put out becomes bet the company. Yeah
[40:22.740 --> 40:29.060]  Alright, let me take a break and thank our first sponsor this week and it is our very good friends at back blaze
[40:29.980 --> 40:35.740]  You guys know back blaze unlimited un-throttled backup for Mac. They have over
[40:36.300 --> 40:39.260]  100 petabytes of total data backed up
[40:39.620 --> 40:43.180]  They just crossed the 6 billion files restored mark
[40:43.180 --> 40:50.380]  That means users of back blaze have used them to restore or download or get on another device over 6
[40:50.780 --> 40:52.780]  billion files
[40:53.380 --> 40:56.940]  They have an iPhone app that lets you access and share any of your files
[40:57.220 --> 41:01.140]  So when your Mac backed up to back place, you're out and about all you have with you is your phone
[41:01.980 --> 41:07.300]  And you want to get a file from your Mac just log into just open the back blaze app and there's all your files
[41:07.340 --> 41:09.680]  Get it. You can email it to someone right from there
[41:09.680 --> 41:12.480]  No need to do anything more complicated than that couldn't be easier
[41:13.440 --> 41:17.320]  You can restore one file or all your files easily
[41:18.560 --> 41:26.080]  with their web restore 25% of all back blaze restores are for just one file so it's not just for
[41:26.080 --> 41:32.880]  Computer disasters, but if you do have a computer disaster, somebody steals your Mac. Somebody breaks in your house takes takes your
[41:33.840 --> 41:35.520]  Takes your Mac takes your backup drive
[41:35.520 --> 41:42.160]  Takes your backup drive your roof leaks water leaks all over your computer ruins your hard drive ruins your time machine
[41:44.240 --> 41:50.160]  You need to you know true total disaster you can just you don't have to wait and download all of your stuff from back blaze
[41:51.120 --> 41:56.640]  Over the internet you could just go there say put it all on a USB hard drive and boom
[41:56.640 --> 41:59.360]  They'll fed exit to you and you know, like a day or two later
[41:59.360 --> 42:05.600]  There's a USB hard drive with all of your files on it ready for you to restore to a new computer
[42:06.400 --> 42:09.880]  software's written by the company's founded by Apple X
[42:10.680 --> 42:11.880]  engineers
[42:11.880 --> 42:14.560]  The software runs totally native on your Mac
[42:15.600 --> 42:18.200]  Runs great on Yosemite runs great on Mavericks
[42:18.960 --> 42:24.080]  Couldn't be installed more easily couldn't be more invisible in the background while it's running
[42:24.080 --> 42:30.720]  Just great great service for an amazing price five bucks a month per Mac
[42:31.280 --> 42:37.760]  unlimited no limits on how much data you can upload five bucks a month so you can get a risk-free
[42:38.320 --> 42:42.800]  No credit card required trial by going here back blaze.com
[42:43.760 --> 42:45.760]  slash daring fireball
[42:45.760 --> 42:49.200]  It you're nuts if you haven't done it and if you're listening to this over the holidays
[42:49.200 --> 42:54.080]  Sign sign your parents up for it. Just go to when you're at your parents house or for Christmas or whatever
[42:54.400 --> 42:58.480]  Just sign them up for back blaze and and give it to them. It's a great little gift
[42:59.200 --> 43:03.040]  They won't thank you for it until they need it. But then when they need it, they'll think you're a superhero
[43:03.040 --> 43:05.200]  So put all your all your relatives on back place
[43:06.240 --> 43:11.360]  My thanks to them. So the first big Apple news of the year 2014 really didn't come to
[43:12.000 --> 43:16.640]  WWDC. Yeah, but what an event? Yeah, I think it was it's certainly
[43:16.640 --> 43:18.640]  it still seems like
[43:19.280 --> 43:22.320]  It doesn't seem like as long ago as it doesn't feel like six months ago
[43:23.360 --> 43:28.100]  No, it was amazing because I was sitting with you and uh, Jason Snell and John Siracusa
[43:28.960 --> 43:34.960]  And different people were just lighting up at different parts of that event. It was just a palpable reaction for them
[43:36.640 --> 43:41.920]  Siracusa and Swift, right? Well, he turned to Snell he goes am I dreaming because if I'm you should tell me because I might be in
[43:41.920 --> 43:43.920]  A fugue state. I don't know if this is real or not
[43:43.920 --> 43:46.640]  Please tell me that I'm actually listening to what I'm listening to
[43:48.080 --> 43:54.560]  That was certainly big news, you know, I was eight and Yosemite it was the first time we got a look at Yosemite
[43:57.760 --> 43:59.760]  And I think you know
[44:01.680 --> 44:03.680]  Certain
[44:03.680 --> 44:05.680]  How should we say it?
[44:06.080 --> 44:10.160]  Not like a specific, you know, like here's three lines of code
[44:10.160 --> 44:16.980]  Copy these exactly. This is how you do x the recommended way but more in terms of like broad strokes philosophy
[44:17.760 --> 44:22.720]  I think apple started pushing a couple of new things not necessarily for the first time but
[44:23.360 --> 44:29.200]  Two examples I can think of was the heavy focus on dynamic user interface layout. Yeah
[44:30.560 --> 44:33.760]  Clearly pre-shadowing, you know pre, you know
[44:33.760 --> 44:40.080]  In in the run-up to the iPhone 6 and 6 plus
[44:42.080 --> 44:44.400]  But I think in the long run more
[44:45.440 --> 44:51.840]  Envisioning a world of iOS devices where there's a continuum of screen sizes, you know
[44:51.840 --> 44:55.280]  And who knows maybe eventually something smaller than four inches
[44:57.680 --> 44:58.640]  And
[44:58.640 --> 45:02.960]  You know by all accounts maybe one of the things you know that we'll be hearing about in 2020
[45:02.960 --> 45:09.040]  Early parts of 2015 would be a bigger screen some kind of ipad that's bigger than 9.7 inches
[45:09.680 --> 45:13.120]  and not having to you know code a
[45:14.400 --> 45:18.720]  Custom user interface for each size in that continuum. It's a definite
[45:18.720 --> 45:23.520]  it's a huge change from the way iOS development was until recently and it's you know,
[45:24.320 --> 45:27.520]  It wasn't just about supporting the iPhone 6 and 6 plus
[45:28.480 --> 45:29.440]  The way I look at it
[45:29.440 --> 45:33.040]  The way I look at it, there's there was the introduction the sorry the integration theme
[45:33.040 --> 45:37.360]  Which we'll probably get to but the other big theme was this transition from push from pull to push
[45:37.760 --> 45:42.400]  where previously the interface was locked to the device and then slowly but surely with things like
[45:42.780 --> 45:47.600]  Airplay and carplay and now watch kit the interface is actually decoupled
[45:47.600 --> 45:50.800]  So you have the logic on one device and the interface going somewhere else
[45:51.120 --> 45:55.040]  Or you have the logic for the app of the interface being able to be flexible between you know
[45:55.040 --> 46:00.160]  The four inch screen size 4.76 inch now that you have split view controllers on the iPhone 6 plus
[46:00.240 --> 46:01.760]  It's sort of like a mini ipad
[46:01.760 --> 46:08.000]  So like you said it can scale across those things but it's it's all sort of one central part of logic
[46:08.320 --> 46:12.880]  And then you add extensibility to it where previously you had to hunt around your iphone for anything
[46:12.880 --> 46:17.520]  You had to go between six different photo apps just to just to get the effects you wanted you had to
[46:17.840 --> 46:21.680]  Leave to to reply to a message you had to leave if you wanted to share to tumblr
[46:21.680 --> 46:24.160]  You couldn't do that from where you were you had to go to the tumblr app and do it
[46:24.160 --> 46:28.720]  And now all of that functionality has come to one place all of that is now independent
[46:28.720 --> 46:34.560]  You have these remote views and to me that's made that that sort of severing of that one unit into these more modular parts
[46:34.800 --> 46:37.280]  Has really made a huge difference not just in my workflow
[46:37.280 --> 46:42.160]  But where I think apple could take all these I think it's the first big hint of much larger plans
[46:42.240 --> 46:44.240]  They have moving forward with these devices
[46:44.240 --> 46:51.600]  Right and you mentioned both carplay which is that's how carplay works where carplay is a dumb terminal effectively
[46:51.600 --> 46:58.640]  and you know take your iphone out of bluetooth range and the only thing the screen is going to show you in your car is
[46:58.640 --> 47:05.920]  The the stuff from the manufacturer you're not going to get any of the apple play stuff or carplay stuff. No ios at all
[47:08.560 --> 47:16.000]  It's only a it's really just effectively a projector your iphone is doing all of the computation your iphone is all of the storage
[47:16.000 --> 47:23.360]  Your iphone is doing the networking for anything that's coming over cellular and the only thing that the screen in your car
[47:23.360 --> 47:31.200]  Does is show you what the iphone is showing and report back to the phone where you're stabbing your fingers at it. Yeah
[47:32.880 --> 47:36.000]  And the watch, you know as we now know and as you know
[47:36.720 --> 47:41.520]  Countless people have have you know the the initial watch kit sdk shows
[47:41.520 --> 47:47.600]  For the first round of third-party apps pretty much works the same way. You don't get to run any code
[47:47.600 --> 47:53.520]  There's no part of watch this initial watch kit where your your app runs code on the watch
[47:53.840 --> 48:00.160]  It's just a projected display of what your phone app your iphone app is showing it
[48:00.720 --> 48:03.040]  And then the watch just reports back what you tapped on
[48:04.800 --> 48:08.400]  I would like that everywhere. I mean, I like the idea of carplay. I bought the the
[48:08.400 --> 48:13.360]  toyota car before they had any integration at all and my only option is to buy a new car if I want anything
[48:13.600 --> 48:18.240]  But with carplay every time I upgrade ios or upgrade my phone I get a better experience
[48:18.240 --> 48:22.880]  I'd like that on my camera. I'd like camera play so that my canon interface is replaced with ios
[48:22.880 --> 48:27.200]  I don't want to have android appliances at home. I want to have them running ios just anytime there's a screen
[48:27.200 --> 48:30.800]  I would eventually like to be able to just put ios like project ios right onto it
[48:32.000 --> 48:36.480]  Doing that with a camera like a canon or you know, like a serious camera
[48:36.480 --> 48:39.520]  like a canon or you know, like a serious serious camera would be
[48:40.300 --> 48:45.760]  Fascinating. I mean there is a move afoot in in the camera world to build in wi-fi
[48:46.560 --> 48:50.880]  But it's I don't and I don't have a camera that does it yet, you know my my fuji
[48:51.840 --> 48:58.080]  Uh x100s is a year off like the brand new x100t which just came out a few weeks ago
[48:58.080 --> 49:04.480]  And I linked to a review of it a couple days ago now has wi-fi but it's clunky like the only way to get it to work
[49:04.480 --> 49:09.920]  I haven't seen it but it's like you have to get a fuji app from the app store and then open the fuji app on
[49:09.920 --> 49:11.280]  your phone
[49:11.280 --> 49:14.560]  and then you can do something between your phone and the
[49:16.080 --> 49:17.600]  Camera whereas
[49:17.600 --> 49:20.080]  Having it be like carplay man. That would be fantastic
[49:20.480 --> 49:23.680]  And it's great for apple because they're never going to get into never is a long time
[49:23.680 --> 49:25.200]  But they're not going to get into making appliances
[49:25.200 --> 49:30.160]  They're not going to become a giant manufacturing conglomerate like samsung and they're not going to license ios the way that you know
[49:30.160 --> 49:34.640]  Android is he was easily able to be put on any device, but just projecting the interface
[49:34.640 --> 49:35.840]  It means they can still control it
[49:35.840 --> 49:40.480]  They in essence just take it over and the customer will have a great experience and they don't have to relinquish
[49:40.480 --> 49:42.480]  Any of the control that they need for products?
[49:42.480 --> 49:49.120]  Yeah, it almost to me takes cameras back to where they were pre-digital right where when you load it had a 35 millimeter film camera
[49:50.000 --> 49:54.240]  The only things you the camera did was let you take pictures, right?
[49:54.240 --> 49:59.120]  You would look through a viewfinder and see and the camera would have things like a light set, you know
[49:59.120 --> 50:02.880]  You know in the latter years, obviously in the early years you had to set all that stuff manually
[50:02.880 --> 50:06.880]  But by that, you know by the latter years of the tail end of the film world
[50:07.520 --> 50:09.520]  You know, it would do the exposure
[50:09.920 --> 50:13.760]  if you set things to auto it would you know set the aperture set the
[50:14.800 --> 50:16.800]  exposure time
[50:18.240 --> 50:24.160]  And then but it was all just about letting you take the next photo then you'd push the button and the photo would be taken
[50:24.240 --> 50:25.760]  It would be stored
[50:25.760 --> 50:27.760]  On the film and that was it
[50:27.760 --> 50:34.080]  Right. I would like a digital camera that worked like that do whatever you can to help me get a perfect exposure and focus
[50:35.040 --> 50:38.160]  You know set the focus distance. Give me a recommended aperture
[50:38.240 --> 50:44.480]  give me a recommended exposure time or let me set any of those variables manually if I choose to and then when I hit
[50:45.440 --> 50:49.520]  Click it to just store the photo and then let me do everything else
[50:50.320 --> 50:54.000]  Over a wireless connection to my iphone. I I would love that
[50:54.000 --> 50:59.360]  Uh for a couple reasons one if you don't have an iphone you would just get whatever the qnix carplay system is
[50:59.440 --> 51:01.760]  You know for the whatever the standard software is on the phone
[51:01.920 --> 51:05.940]  But if you do have it you get a better experience and that becomes the same reason you want to get carplay
[51:06.160 --> 51:10.960]  You know you this stuff all works better if you happen to have an iphone. Yeah, boy, that would be great. Yeah
[51:12.160 --> 51:15.700]  But I do totally think that you know the wwdc 2014
[51:16.640 --> 51:19.120]  heralded that sort of you know future
[51:19.120 --> 51:23.600]  I I think so too and I think we also see for example continuity is going to work on the watch because there's going to
[51:23.600 --> 51:26.720]  Be things on the watch the watch to me is total convenience play
[51:26.720 --> 51:32.880]  It's for all those thousands of tiny interactions that you have with your phone every day that aren't that don't take a lot of time
[51:32.880 --> 51:33.680]  But are super important yet
[51:33.680 --> 51:38.160]  You still have to go to your bag or go to your purse or go to your pocket and I can sort of shift
[51:38.160 --> 51:43.600]  Those to my watch, but if something ends up being more important than I thought it was being able to just send that right back
[51:44.000 --> 51:46.640]  To my phone and continue on my phone sync is great
[51:46.640 --> 51:51.760]  But with sync I still have to unlock the phone go find the app go to the same place what I was scroll through or try
[51:51.760 --> 51:57.600]  To find it but with continuity I can be looking at something press a button and that exact same thing is just there waiting for me
[51:57.600 --> 52:01.200]  Again, I think that's gonna be much much more interesting when the watch is in play
[52:02.320 --> 52:05.440]  Yeah, I do and I think a lot of these things are sort of breaking
[52:06.080 --> 52:10.800]  It goes back to what I said earlier about apple pay where it's at a
[52:10.800 --> 52:19.280]  It's at a from a user's perspective. It's outside the app centric world of using the phone itself. It's
[52:20.080 --> 52:23.120]  It's much more about the real physical world
[52:23.760 --> 52:26.900]  Where your phone is just within the bluetooth?
[52:27.600 --> 52:31.360]  And or wi-fi, you know wireless range of whatever
[52:32.080 --> 52:36.960]  Terminal you're dealing with whether the terminal is your watch whether it's your dashboard in your car
[52:36.960 --> 52:40.400]  And you just tap on the watch and things get started
[52:40.400 --> 52:45.440]  You don't have to wake up your phone you don't and you definitely don't have to find any particular app
[52:46.240 --> 52:49.200]  Like a fuji app to get you know to get this to work
[52:49.280 --> 52:51.920]  You're just on your camera and hit a button on your camera
[52:52.560 --> 52:57.760]  And you know the phone interface just wakes up and starts, you know can read those photos that are right on your phone
[52:57.760 --> 53:07.200]  Yeah, the phone becomes like the star destroyer and the watch becomes the shuttlecraft that moves you in between the big objects
[53:07.200 --> 53:09.200]  That's pretty good I like that
[53:09.600 --> 53:11.440]  um
[53:11.440 --> 53:14.640]  What else from wwdc I guess yosemite we could yeah
[53:15.360 --> 53:21.760]  You know and in the summer there wasn't really any news per se it was just you know betas of ios and yosemite
[53:22.160 --> 53:24.160]  Not a bad way to just roll into
[53:24.160 --> 53:27.520]  If we're going to talk 2014 in hindsight, I mean have to talk yosemite
[53:28.480 --> 53:34.720]  Yeah, I mean, uh, dave wiskers did an article on macworld right beforehand where you're sort of speculating of what yosemite would end up
[53:34.720 --> 53:40.560]  Looking like and I think he was really really close. It's like apple didn't just clone ios 7 which was a long-running joke
[53:41.520 --> 53:43.360]  They they sort of took the cues from it
[53:43.760 --> 53:48.480]  The translucency and and the other effects and they made something that was very matte and you know
[53:48.480 --> 53:52.320]  They kept the shadows for example. Yeah our example when dave and I were
[53:52.320 --> 53:55.920]  Noodling ideas for vesper mac before we saw yosemite
[53:56.720 --> 54:01.200]  And we thought well what if they do totally just go all in ios 7 look and feel
[54:01.600 --> 54:07.200]  And we the only thing we could come up with was the the iCloud web apps. Yeah, which are
[54:07.920 --> 54:14.320]  You know you you use them with a mouse pointer and you know, I think typically I don't even think they run on an ipad
[54:15.120 --> 54:17.120]  So I mean you're using it on a mac
[54:17.120 --> 54:22.880]  So I mean you're using it on a mac and they have some things like dialogue boxes that you know
[54:23.360 --> 54:28.400]  You know, it's like a you know, how would you do an ios 7 dialogue box with a mouse pointer?
[54:29.040 --> 54:30.720]  um
[54:30.720 --> 54:34.080]  But overall boy we looked at that and we're like boy, I hope that's not it. Yeah
[54:35.840 --> 54:40.160]  No, and it wasn't it had to be enough because they did that back to the mac event and they
[54:40.480 --> 54:43.440]  Changed the names of the apps and they they brought over the same look and feel
[54:43.440 --> 54:47.040]  And they really made an effort to get all the people who had ios devices
[54:47.600 --> 54:52.020]  Not not to make the mac the same but to make them comfortable to make an easy sort of a halo effect transition
[54:52.400 --> 54:56.480]  And when you look at yosemite and you look at continuity, it's just about adding value again
[54:56.560 --> 54:59.920]  If you have an iphone or ipad, you'll have a much better experience with a mac
[55:01.280 --> 55:06.080]  Yeah, absolutely. I do think too and it shows and part of it is you know
[55:06.080 --> 55:13.600]  our perspective where we get to go to these press events and talk to some of the people at apple like in the product marketing group, um
[55:14.240 --> 55:18.800]  And there's a palpable sense. I mean you could there's some things that they just it just never come up
[55:18.800 --> 55:20.800]  I mean nobody really spends a long time
[55:21.280 --> 55:23.280]  talking about the
[55:23.360 --> 55:28.480]  We don't even call them that anymore but like the iworks apps. Yeah, right like pages and numbers and keynote
[55:29.040 --> 55:34.480]  They they you know, there's hasn't been a lot of enthusiasm about those apps in in recent years
[55:34.480 --> 55:36.480]  I'm not saying there's none. I'm just saying
[55:36.720 --> 55:38.320]  that it's
[55:38.320 --> 55:42.880]  You know, I I think it shows in the real world and you know in this current state of those apps
[55:43.280 --> 55:46.960]  And I think it shows in the enthusiasm when you talk to people at apple privately
[55:47.120 --> 55:53.440]  But whereas like the mac overall and yosemite overall like there were people there's people at apple who just still love the mac
[55:53.600 --> 55:59.520]  Like as a whole it is not like the you know, forgotten first child
[56:00.240 --> 56:01.360]  you know
[56:01.360 --> 56:07.360]  You know brushed aside in favor of the beloved, you know, ios, you know
[56:08.400 --> 56:13.600]  And I wonder if that has anything to do with the mac like the yosemite being very firmly in federighi's org
[56:13.600 --> 56:17.840]  But things like iwork and itunes all being projects that are run by in cues org, you know
[56:17.840 --> 56:21.120]  It's almost like a totally secondary software development system
[56:21.680 --> 56:25.520]  I do wonder about that and I don't know if it's because
[56:26.880 --> 56:28.720]  it's any way to
[56:28.720 --> 56:35.680]  To slag at eq, but almost that he's got so much on his plate that how could it get any more of his attention?
[56:35.840 --> 56:37.920]  You know with how much that he's got on his plate
[56:39.200 --> 56:40.640]  And you don't have the federica, you know
[56:40.640 --> 56:44.640]  Like the one guy who's in charge of software engineering isn't in charge of those bits of software engineering
[56:44.720 --> 56:48.000]  but as a whole I I you know this year I i've
[56:48.960 --> 56:54.800]  I think that the people i've spoken to at apple were more excited about yosemite and what's new on the mac than ios 8
[56:54.800 --> 56:59.680]  And you know and a lot of it is hard to separate because so much of what's new about both ios 8 and yosemite
[56:59.840 --> 57:03.200]  Is the continuity stuff which ties them together and there is no
[57:03.920 --> 57:10.160]  One without the other that was one of the most impressive things to me because famously ios and os 10 used to be run separately
[57:10.720 --> 57:14.400]  And there was a big rework but not only that it's it's it filtered down
[57:14.400 --> 57:19.840]  so instead of having someone in charge of yosemite and someone in charge of ios the person who was in charge of
[57:19.840 --> 57:26.160]  Extensibility or the at least the engineering product manager program manager was in charge of extensibility for ios and os 10
[57:26.320 --> 57:29.040]  Was in charge of continuity for ios and ios 10
[57:29.280 --> 57:32.720]  And even when it would have been easier to do them separately or do them in different ways
[57:32.960 --> 57:34.640]  They made sure that they were done in the same way
[57:34.640 --> 57:39.040]  So developers had just one way to target them on both systems and that might be a subtle change
[57:39.040 --> 57:42.000]  But I think that's a really profound change based on how apple used to be run
[57:43.040 --> 57:48.480]  Yeah, and I I have you know, it's a recurring theme, you know, since he left the company
[57:48.480 --> 57:56.080]  But you know with forestall and again, I overall i'm a big fan of forestall and I think you know for scott forestall
[57:56.720 --> 57:58.720]  Is a huge reason
[57:58.720 --> 58:05.760]  That the iphone was a hit product and was as good as it was. I think he's a huge reason that the app store
[58:06.380 --> 58:12.080]  Exists and that it's as popular as it is problems aside and we can get into that because there's been a lot of recent
[58:12.240 --> 58:15.360]  you know problems with the app store, but on the whole, you know, it's
[58:16.160 --> 58:18.160]  uh
[58:18.160 --> 58:21.200]  You know a success and you know at a time when in
[58:21.900 --> 58:24.480]  2007 when the first iphone came out and there wasn't any
[58:25.040 --> 58:27.040]  Third-party software at all
[58:27.360 --> 58:31.360]  And there were questions about whether there ever would be and then even when it was announced
[58:31.440 --> 58:33.600]  Well, how how strict are they going to keep this?
[58:33.680 --> 58:38.080]  How much is it going to be a handful of apps that apple vets and how much is it going to be?
[58:38.640 --> 58:41.760]  You know, are they going to allow tens of thousands hundreds thousands of apps?
[58:42.320 --> 58:43.440]  um
[58:43.440 --> 58:48.400]  I think all of that is thanks to forestall or at least at least partly thanks to forestall. Absolutely
[58:48.560 --> 58:51.200]  But on the other hand, I don't think continuity happens
[58:52.160 --> 58:59.920]  All in one fell swoop in 2014 if forestall is still running ios as his own fiefdom because the way he ran it was
[59:00.700 --> 59:02.240]  secretly
[59:02.240 --> 59:06.400]  Even when it wasn't new, you know, even you know, it you know, 20
[59:07.260 --> 59:09.260]  2012 I guess when he
[59:09.840 --> 59:11.840]  Got pushed out
[59:11.840 --> 59:17.920]  You know, yeah, I think he was a phenomenal partner for steve jobs when you hear stories about when he was at apple
[59:18.400 --> 59:22.400]  Uh, he he knew which of the three studded leather textures
[59:22.880 --> 59:27.280]  Steve would pick and when he wasn't there the designers just kept hearing no and no and no over and over again
[59:27.360 --> 59:29.840]  And he was just so good at working with steve jobs
[59:29.840 --> 59:30.400]  But then you know
[59:30.400 --> 59:35.280]  He faced an apple without steve jobs and it's possible that he was the best person in the world to birth
[59:35.600 --> 59:38.720]  The iphone but not the best person to get it through the awkward teenage years
[59:38.720 --> 59:42.320]  And we'll see that with the watch now because kevin lynch runs watch software at apple
[59:42.320 --> 59:44.240]  It's not in craig federighi's org
[59:44.240 --> 59:48.640]  But that's sort of what you have to do when you're creating something new you have to give it that sort of independent space
[59:48.960 --> 59:52.080]  To come alive and then you integrate it back again over time, right?
[59:52.240 --> 59:58.400]  But even with lynch and and you know, that's a good open question as in terms of like what to look look for in 2015
[59:59.280 --> 01:00:02.240]  You know is how good is their initial watch software going to be?
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.040]  And you know
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.880]  Whether it's fair or not
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:13.140]  You know how good the initial like when we get our first apple watch 1.0 in quote early 2015
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:22.080]  We're gonna we're all going to form pretty firm opinions of kevin lynch as an apple product manager
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.480]  Well right off the bat
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:27.360]  But lynch was hired into an apple
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:30.080]  Where you know, he could be told
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:34.400]  Point blank and i'm sure was this is how we work now. We collaborate, you know
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:39.840]  And I think that's why you see, you know that you know shiller's already wearing an apple watch eddie q's wearing an apple watch
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:44.880]  Federighi is wearing an apple watch, you know that they're not locked out of that
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:49.440]  In the way that I think a lot of people were with the iphone before it came out
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:54.400]  And the other thing that I mean i've heard really good things about kevin lynch's work at apple
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.320]  Like he sounds like he's doing a great job
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.240]  But also while the watch stuff is separate, uh, for example
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.600]  Like I don't know this for a fact
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:05.360]  But it sounds to me like the messages is not being like if you're working on watch messages
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.240]  You're not allowed to talk to the guy working on ios or mac messages
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:12.800]  It sounds like that's not the case that the messages group, you know spans across from that which is what you want
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.880]  Because otherwise it's going to create a broken experience
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:21.460]  Yeah, I do. I think that's absolutely the case where where he you know, it might be separate from federighi's
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:26.560]  Stuff but in a sense it's not because it's federighi isn't trusted with it or he's not part of it
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:30.720]  But that he's already got enough on his plate and they need this is such a big undertaking that it needs
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:36.800]  Its own point person and team but they're not I think the difference is maybe maybe the word is fiefdom
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:43.600]  You know that ios was run by scott forestall as his own fiefdom within the company and that's not the case with the watch
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.560]  And I was talking to brad els about this last week
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:49.440]  But you you look at the design cues of the watch and you start to imagine
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:52.320]  It's not just a copy of ios 7 or a copy of yosemite
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:57.120]  It is it is being given the room to be its own thing sort of establish its own identity as well
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:03.280]  Yeah, I almost get the sense that it if there's anything that holds up as an analogy. It's almost like the watch os
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.840]  Is to ios what ios was to mac os. Yeah, you know that yes
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:16.640]  We're not throwing everything out the kernel. It might be the exact same kernel. There's there it might be a ui kit
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:22.480]  That's doing drawing it runs frontboard like the iphone runs frontboard, right?
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:27.680]  But that it's it's just about base, you know using the technology that makes sense to reuse but
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:29.680]  but
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:34.660]  Stripping it down to a level that's appropriate for this new dramatically
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:38.640]  Lesser form factor. Yeah, but the the strategic
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.800]  aspects of how the software runs
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:48.480]  Couldn't be more different from the original iphone where the original iphone
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:52.720]  Only had this tangential relationship with your mac, which was
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:57.680]  connect a 30 pin connector and a usb cord to the two
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:02:59.840]  and
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:02.320]  Hit a you know sync and wait
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:08.560]  And have you know, I still think it's almost seems prehistoric. I can't believe it's only seven years ago
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:11.840]  But that's the only way you've got calendar events onto your phone
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:15.120]  Or back to your mac if you created the event on your phone
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:18.720]  That's the only way you could sync calendar events. The only way you could sync contacts
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:27.600]  It's crazy that you only had to do all that tethered but then once you untethered your phone was a completely
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:31.360]  Iphone was a completely independent device that had to do everything
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:37.680]  Any kind of computation was done on the cpu on the phone all of the drawing was done on the gpu on the phone
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:42.160]  and the watch at least for third-party software is largely just
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:46.640]  At least for third-party software is largely just a projected screen
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.280]  Where it's doing the least work possible?
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.600]  yeah, it's almost like uh
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:55.840]  The web app solution for the original iphone where when you no longer connect it to the internet
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:59.680]  Nothing can update when you're not when your phone's no longer in vicinity. Nothing can update right?
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.320]  Yeah, absolutely
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.920]  Let's take a break and we'll come back and talk more yosemite
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:13.280]  Um, but I want to thank our second sponsor and it's another long time friend of the show our good friends at linda

[01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:45.540]  Uh
[01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:48.020]  Do you still have any machines that are running mavericks renee?
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:53.620]  I don't I waited a year to upgrade from uh mountain lion to mavericks on my podcast machine
[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:56.340]  And I think I lasted a month before putting asemite on it
[01:07:57.860 --> 01:07:58.740]  I
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:02.500]  Still have the the air that I use to record these shows
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:09.460]  Uh, like i'm recording right now using my my old macbook air still runs the latest version of mavericks and it's funny
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:12.100]  how
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.500]  It feels to me like it's years old
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:18.980]  Yeah, like I can't I was just thinking before we started recording and thinking about the you know
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:23.140]  You're all I was like, I wonder how long I how long how out of date am I and then I realized i'm really only like
[01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:25.860]  It's still only like two months out of date
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:30.740]  But it looks ancient to my eyes just the wallpaper when you see the maverick's wallpaper
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:32.740]  It feels like a bygone era
[01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:38.260]  Yeah, I think so, but it's the to me. It's the fonts, you know, and the the heaviness of the buttons
[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:44.500]  It's yeah, it's it's a much heavier more dour, uh experience and that's probably why I upgraded
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:47.940]  I just I would look at it when i'd podcast and it would just look wrong to me
[01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:51.860]  And it was a visuals. I think more than anything else that encouraged me to upgrade
[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:55.620]  Yeah, I think I over the holiday break. I'm going to upgrade this machine to it
[01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:59.460]  I can't think of a good reason to keep one around anymore either. There's nothing
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:00.740]  There's nothing
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:02.020]  you know
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:05.940]  It's really just out of laziness and the fact that I don't use this machine for much anymore
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:10.020]  um, it just happens to be all set up with the you know,
[01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:14.820]  Software I use to record the shows and so it's sort of like and if it ain't broke don't
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:20.500]  Fix it situation, but it just staring at it just looks ugly
[01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:26.340]  Yeah, and I got the retina 5k iMac after the event. I just couldn't un unsee it and you know that shipped with
[01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:28.340]  um
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:30.100]  a ship with uh
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:32.580]  Yosemite yeah, and I was just all in yeah
[01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:34.180]  um
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:38.580]  I've also grown to be completely I don't I wouldn't quite say in love
[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:45.620]  But i'm completely accustomed to the the system version of Helvetica Neue as the system font
[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:49.220]  It's it looks so good on a retina
[01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:54.020]  We were arguing the other day whether it you would prefer to have something like san francisco or the mythical apple songs
[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:59.220]  If if they ever shipped it, but they they did a really great job of putting Helvetica Neue on on the Mac
[01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:02.260]  Do you have any idea whether san francisco is apple sands?
[01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:06.020]  I've heard that it isn't I don't know if that's true or not because I haven't heard it from a lot of people
[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:08.020]  But I heard an offhand comment that it wasn't
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:11.300]  I wouldn't be surprised if it's not but I have no no idea
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:15.640]  Like the little birdies that told me about apple sands and the little birdies that told me about san francisco
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:19.380]  Or they didn't really tell me about it. I didn't know about it in advance
[01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:22.760]  But uh, but that told me that internally they were calling it dinvetica
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.360]  um
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:28.440]  But nobody's told me whether they're one in the same and I can't help but think that they're not the same
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:33.560]  I mean, it's hard to interpret because it's almost like reading smoke signals and it could just mean that this is an optimized version of
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:37.560]  Apple songs for the watch and that's why they're considered different but it struck me that they were different
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:44.040]  Yeah, the thing i've found playing with san francisco is that it really only looks good very very small
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:46.200]  I mean and
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:50.040]  From my hands on time, you know months ago at the apple watch event
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:54.200]  I thought it looked fantastic up close like just really really looked good
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.840]  um
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.160]  Playing with it on my mac now that we have the sdk
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:04.600]  It doesn't really look good to me at the sizes that I use fonts on the mac. Yeah, it's not optimized, right?
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.760]  and I tried the uh
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.840]  I think I mentioned this a few shows ago, but I tried
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:13.500]  There's like a github thing with a hacked versions of san francisco
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:18.200]  That have metadata set that make it look like they tell the system. It's the system font
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.200]  and if you put them and I
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:24.280]  I don't recommend anybody try this because it's you know hacking with your system that you're on your own
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:29.560]  But more or less what you do is you put these hacked versions and also it's you know, like a copyright violation and a direct
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:31.560]  um
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:37.160]  violation of the terms of the sdk download that that you you're not allowed to diddle with the san francisco font and you're
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:40.760]  Expressively not allowed to use it for anything other than developing watch kit apps
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:45.320]  Um, but what you could do is go to find this project on github
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:51.640]  Download these versions of the fonts which are different from apple's versions. There's some kind of metadata that's set that tells the system
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.280]  Hey, this is the system font you put them in
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:57.160]  at slash library
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.600]  or
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:00.600]  Yeah, slash library fonts
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.320]  slash library fonts
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.000]  and
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.560]  You can't put them in your user font file not you, you know users your name
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:17.180]  Library fonts because the system won't look there for system fonts. The system looks first in slash system library fonts
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:22.300]  And that's your helvetica system font is still there. You're not replacing it. You're not deleting it
[01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:24.060]  You're not renaming it you're not moving it
[01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:29.340]  But then the system will look in slash library fonts and if it finds another system font there it'll use that one instead
[01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:31.580]  So you just put these font files there
[01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:34.060]  log out log back in
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:39.680]  And yosemite, you know will draw as with the system font. It'll use san francisco
[01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:43.180]  So I tried it just to see what it was like
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:50.300]  And it's it just doesn't work. Like it's it's not that it doesn't work like it's broken and it you know, it's you know
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:55.740]  A technical failure just aesthetically. It's just kind of not right
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:59.900]  Which is interesting because I didn't think i'd like helvetica on the mac as much as I did but then
[01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:04.620]  Uh after the apple tv update which came much after you much after wwc
[01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:10.700]  And now i'm seeing helvetica on my apple tv. That is much more every time I see it. I get a little reaction to it. Yeah
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:18.460]  And it feels it's somehow crazy to me how apple has made it a font that is available to everyone anywhere. Yeah
[01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:20.860]  Feel like they own it
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:23.980]  Yeah, and it just when they use it. It's it's such an established font
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:27.340]  It's such a classic and yet it feels so modern in the way that they're using it. Yeah
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:31.740]  But I don't think I at san francisco to me. It's it's completely designed
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:38.140]  I think for the watch and it's meant to be used at watch-like sizes, which are physically very very small
[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:42.780]  Yeah, like the biggest you're ever going to see text on your apple watch is a pretty small size
[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:48.400]  It's it's sort of in context like I know you've spoken with us on previous shows with the vibrancy
[01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:51.820]  And you know some people turn it off but i've even gotten used to that
[01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:55.500]  i've gotten used to seeing areas of red or black or or things and it it just
[01:13:55.500 --> 01:14:00.700]  I don't buy the argument that it brings a desktop through but it does sort of of make the whole system seem more alive
[01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:05.100]  Yeah, i'm but there's no doubt that like syracuse has mentioned several times
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:10.220]  There's no doubt that that's going to get toned down. Yeah next year and a year after you know that they start out with
[01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:13.660]  Taking an idea to the maximal level
[01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:19.580]  And then over the years dial it back to where it should be but they're they you know, apple is it as a company
[01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:25.100]  Tends to err on the side of taking an idea too far than taking not taking it far enough
[01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:27.660]  Yeah, and it's also they're very for a giant company
[01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:31.260]  They have they have a lot of respect for the singular designer vision like the person who designed
[01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:35.660]  Yosemite had a lot of ideas and those ideas not all of them made it through but a lot of them did in a lot
[01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:39.180]  Of companies it would have fallen to design by committee very quickly. Yeah
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:47.340]  So I think overall Yosemite has been a pretty pretty strong success
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:53.820]  Yeah, agreed completely and for all the bugs that ios 8 had and you know hit so many people I think I I think
[01:14:54.060 --> 01:15:01.180]  Yosemite has been pretty stable and and you know deserves applause right from the get-go for for being pretty
[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:03.980]  Trouble-free if you were an early adopter
[01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:10.060]  They had a couple wi-fi patch and wi-fi and bluetooth seem to be something that just affects some percentage of people every time
[01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:14.300]  They had some security things even today. They patched it. I think it was yesterday
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:19.820]  Even today they patched it. I think it was yesterday. They're they're patching security now faster than they've ever done before
[01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:23.980]  Yeah, it's it's really a new age in at least a delivery of mac software
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:29.500]  Yeah today as we record we're recording on december 23rd, and uh, it might have rolled out
[01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:32.140]  I think it rolled out last night at least on us time
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:35.340]  But within the 24 hours that we're recording as as we speak
[01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:40.780]  There was a a bug fix that apple rolled out that for the first time ever they pushed
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:42.940]  to
[01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:45.900]  Uh, at least we have semity. I don't know if maverick's got the push
[01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:50.220]  But if you're running Yosemite, I got the notification like when I logged in this morning
[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:55.260]  It just said a security update was applied. Yeah, and that's it. It's like, you know
[01:15:56.620 --> 01:16:01.900]  And I you know, it's a lot of pressure for them because if they ever pushed one of those that did break things
[01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:04.460]  It's there it's going to be
[01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:06.300]  you know
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:09.260]  Quite a scandal. Yeah, I mean they're paying close attention to that stuff now
[01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:12.860]  But it's sort of we complained that they weren't being fast enough with security updates and at a certain point
[01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:16.060]  They just you know, pick up the pace. Yeah, and I you know
[01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:22.380]  The the the thanks for that the applause for that is never as loud as the criticism beforehand. No
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:28.240]  No, no, it does seem like they're getting faster. Um, I can't help but think that with the bluetooth and wi-fi
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:30.380]  that it must
[01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:33.100]  it must just be that the matrix of
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:38.620]  How many different wi-fi chipsets there are in all the supported max that run Yosemite?
[01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:44.780]  Multiplied by all the various chipsets in the wi-fi routers out in the real world
[01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:47.420]  is just
[01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:50.460]  It it's just a testing nightmare like it, you know
[01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:53.980]  You know, it's almost we're almost lucky that it works at all
[01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:57.020]  Because it just happens over and over and over again
[01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:00.220]  I just run all apple stuff and i've never had a wi-fi or bluetooth problem
[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:03.980]  But I imagine when you like you say if you have every single vendor in there and every single variant you're gonna
[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:06.860]  You're gonna hit whatever bugs are in both those stacks fairly often
[01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:09.660]  Yeah, I have an apple
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:14.860]  Router downstairs. I think it's the latest whatever extreme. I don't know what they call it anymore. But the one that's tall
[01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:22.220]  And have for years and i've never been hit with those problems either because i'm surely you know
[01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:27.980]  Every single standard apple wi-fi chipset in a mac does get tested against apple's own
[01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:31.020]  Routers. Yeah, I think they're first in line, right?
[01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:37.820]  And I think that max or I mean you see bugs with with ios and wi-fi too
[01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:41.980]  But I do think it seems to hit the mac more and I can't help but think it's because the mac hardware is not as
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:47.980]  Unified as as ios hardware. I think ipad air 2 is the first ipad where we didn't see a bunch of people complaining about wi-fi
[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:50.700]  As soon as it launched
[01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:56.460]  Yeah, I I get the feeling that like supporting wi-fi at the driver level is you know, sort of
[01:17:56.460 --> 01:18:03.020]  Like supporting imap when you're writing a male client which it meaning that every single imap
[01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:07.500]  Server has like a different interpretation of the imap spec at some level. Yeah
[01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:15.900]  Like there's no way to just write a generic imap client every imap client that it gains any popularity because it hasn't you know
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.900]  It it's actually useful
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:19.900]  effectively as you know, it
[01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:25.100]  You know, i'm server by server list of exceptions and and stuff like that
[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:28.540]  Which was the big complaint about mail and mavericks, especially with gmails
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:33.980]  Eccentric to use the polite word imap implementation and now with yosemite. You don't hear that very much anymore either
[01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:37.980]  No, you don't I I think it's I think they've cleaned that up pretty well. Yeah
[01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:45.180]  Where are we at in a calendar year? I think we're heading towards the iphone 6 and 6 plus event. Yeah
[01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:49.260]  Which was also the debut of the watch. Yeah
[01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:52.300]  Big and bigger and then small
[01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:53.740]  right
[01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:55.740]  right and apple pay
[01:18:56.460 --> 01:19:00.620]  Yeah, and in the demo area, I mean they had the iphones laid out. They had the ipads
[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:04.460]  They had the apple watch laid out and then they had a whole area where you could go and see
[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:07.020]  apple pay both in the app and at a simulated
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:10.300]  checkout station
[01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:13.420]  Yeah, and I do think that's a good example of how
[01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:22.460]  How difficult this you know in broad strokes strokes how difficult apple and you know, anybody else who's in the industry but
[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:29.900]  How it's not a month to month year to year game. It's a decade-long game because even with apple pay
[01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:37.340]  You know, it's intertwined with the iphone 6 because it's the iphone 6 and 6 plus are the only phones that work with apple pay
[01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:39.900]  At least at retail terminals
[01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:47.900]  And you know you had to have touch id first so that was a year that goes back a year ago to the iphone 5
[01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:49.820]  s
[01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:56.300]  You had to have it and it had to work really well. So that starts a year ago now this year
[01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:59.260]  you've got the two new phones that have nfc built in
[01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:05.900]  And the rollout in the retail stores of the terminals, you know that accept it
[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:12.140]  But you're still talking about a service that only works
[01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:17.340]  Two months in for people who've bought a brand new top of the line iphone within the last two months
[01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:19.900]  right, like the real the real apple play is
[01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:24.700]  Two three years ago when 85 of active iphone users are using
[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:27.180]  Something iphone 6 or newer
[01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:32.300]  It shows uh the patience that apple has for some things and it shows how for example
[01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:35.900]  Nfc to a lot of their competitors was just a chipset like they would just throw it in there
[01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:39.980]  They didn't really care what you did with it different manufacturers would do different things where apple
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:41.100]  There's no such thing as a chipset
[01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:46.540]  It's a feature set and they experimented with nfc there were prototypes with nfc for years and they just never shipped it because they
[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:51.900]  Didn't have a feature set that needed it not that it was a you know curiosity and might be a benefit but actually needed it
[01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:55.900]  As a core technology in the phone and when they did they put nfc in and they shipped it
[01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:58.460]  And it took until iphone 6 for that to happen
[01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:03.580]  But like you said they had to have passbook they had to have touch id they'd have all these things in place
[01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:08.700]  And then when it made sense as a product it gets shipped. Yeah, i've i've heard about nfc for iphone
[01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:13.820]  I think as far back as 2009 which was the year that the 3gs came out
[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:15.820]  and that
[01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:18.540]  Trying to think when that was that I heard that
[01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:24.060]  I mean, it would have it wouldn't have been right before it would have been, you know, like seven or eight months before
[01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:29.740]  That it was a maybe for the next iphone, you know, and clearly, you know, obviously did not happen
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:31.260]  uh
[01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:37.500]  And I you know, I think ultimately, you know, why not and then again, it was a recurring thing like 2009. Maybe 2010
[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:40.540]  Definitely, maybe apple is very very interested in nfc
[01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:45.660]  Um, so that would have been the iphone 4, you know, it wasn't there and I think it was always, you know
[01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:49.020]  Is that there was no story behind it, right? There's no
[01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:52.780]  What how how is this actually going to be useful to people in the real world?
[01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:55.100]  Absolutely. I mean
[01:21:55.100 --> 01:22:01.260]  They would prototype apple prototypes almost any anything that you can find a blog post about that makes even the slightest logical sense
[01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:05.100]  Apple will prototyped it like when they say max make no sense for multi-touch
[01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:06.780]  It's not because they're just you know
[01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:11.500]  Daydreaming or saying it for the sake of saying it is because they built it they spent a lot of time trying it and they decided
[01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:14.460]  It wasn't an experience. They want to ship and it in one day
[01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:19.740]  Maybe it will be and with nfc it was in later stage prototypes for different phones and they're trying things and they're like you said
[01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:24.140]  No story, so it didn't ship and then as soon as they had a really compelling story, which was apple pay
[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:30.380]  That's in every phone we have now. Yeah, so tying it in you know, the iphone 6 announcement with
[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:32.620]  This week's news. There's another
[01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:38.700]  rumor that came out of asia some analyst that uh, that apple is considering a
[01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:46.140]  For a new four-inch iphone for next year, did you see that? Yep. I think mac rumors had it
[01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:52.220]  I think the name the guy came up with it was totally stupid. He called it the iphone 6s
[01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:55.100]  mini, yeah
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:57.100]  They call it a 6s minus
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:23:00.700]  I think the name would be clearly it would be the iphone 6c, right? Yep
[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:06.460]  I I think it almost certainly would be the iphone 6c and if not see then air maybe
[01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:10.140]  It's got to be 6s minus 6s and 6s plus
[01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:14.220]  Use them just write that math analogy into the ground
[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:18.560]  Minus and they'd actually spell it out like minus
[01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:25.100]  I think again i'm i'm almost you know, I can't say i'm positive but I think it's very likely that apple's prototyping four-inch iphones
[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:29.020]  Because they prototype tons of different sizes what was interesting to me is I heard you say that
[01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:33.180]  On a previous show. It might have been two episodes ago or three episodes ago and I was curious
[01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:38.620]  You know what android people thought of that because their phones I mean their their version of the htc1 mini was I think
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:41.900]  You know five inches or something and so I asked them, you know
[01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:46.140]  Is there a demand for four-inch android phones and I heard crickets people said no 4.7
[01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:50.780]  Is the smallest we'd ever want and to me that that doesn't mean apple should make one
[01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:54.140]  That means there's probably a segment of the market that is totally underserved
[01:23:54.140 --> 01:24:00.860]  By the volume vendors and that there is opportunity for people who are distinguished or or have very specific tastes and and would enjoy
[01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:05.820]  Ios at that size. Yeah, I the thing that makes and this isn't based on this guy's reporting
[01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:11.260]  This is just my I close my eyes and think about the way apple thinks and the way apple has acted over the last seven
[01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:14.060]  Years, and I think it's probably true
[01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:17.020]  But I also think that calling it the 6c
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:21.820]  Whether they call it that or not tells you exactly what it's going to be is I think it's going to be
[01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:23.660]  an a8
[01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:25.660]  You know this year's a8
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:28.700]  And a camera like this year's camera
[01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:39.500]  It's you know going to be effectively an iphone 6 shrunk to four inches whereas the iphone 6s and 6s plus
[01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:44.220]  If they call them that we'll get the a9 and they'll get a better camera
[01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:48.780]  And other, you know, whatever the 2015 technical improvements are
[01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:52.460]  So that you'll be able to buy a four-inch iphone next year
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:25:00.860]  And you'll have touch id and you'll have apple pay and you'll have an a8 and you'll have a camera like the one we have today
[01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:04.620]  But if you want the top of the line if you want the newest the latest and greatest
[01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:11.500]  Camera, if you want the latest and greatest, uh system on a chip, you're still going to have to go 4.7 or or
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:13.340]  5.5
[01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:16.300]  Yeah, it makes a lot of sense for the same reasons like because the iphone 6s
[01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:22.300]  Yeah, it makes a lot of sense for the same reasons like because the the iphone 5c kept was always called the cheap iphone
[01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:25.500]  And apple never makes cheap products, but they wanted to make a popular iphone
[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:28.700]  They wanted something that would sit on the shelves not like a blockbuster movie
[01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:31.020]  But like a tv show that just people could buy anytime
[01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:34.460]  But it also let them shove that down to the bottom of the line much faster
[01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:38.540]  They wouldn't have to leave an iphone 5 there and the same logic makes sense to the you know
[01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:41.820]  For an iphone 6c to be able to move that down the product line faster
[01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:46.380]  And make apple pay more accessible to more people or and to have it in more parts of their product lineup
[01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:52.060]  Yeah, and I think the other thing that they don't want is that third pricing tier
[01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:55.740]  That starts it because that's the other thing if you do want a new four inch phone next year
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:58.460]  I do the other if i'm right that it's going to be
[01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:03.180]  The 2014 tech technical stuff, you know the a8 and the camera etc
[01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:08.620]  The upside will be that you'll save money because I think it'll start at 99 on a contract and you know
[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:13.420]  If it's off contract, it'll be a hundred dollars less than the the six ass
[01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:19.980]  Yeah, if you have 4.7 at the 199 mark the four inch just based on human behavior has to be cheaper
[01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:20.540]  Yeah
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:27.820]  The thing that I think they wanted to get away from is having that 99 tier and i'm speaking in the subsidized terms
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:34.220]  But the 99 tier look virtually identical to the 199 tier. Yeah
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:37.740]  Right. That's what the six or the five c
[01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:40.700]  Did is they you know, it had exactly the same
[01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:42.700]  tech specs
[01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:45.500]  Almost to a t as the iphone 5
[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:50.060]  But it looked different and some people, you know, obviously some people thought it looked better
[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:52.380]  I know people who bought it because they wanted a colorful phone
[01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:57.020]  But it's still even if that's the case then, you know good for you. You saved 100 bucks
[01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:03.500]  but I don't think apple liked it where up until the 5c was introduced the the
[01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:12.060]  99 option looked or nearly identical, you know, there were obviously some certain tells that you could tell an iphone 4 from a 4s
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:16.380]  you know the antenna bands were it's certainly different at slightly different points and
[01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:22.540]  Earlier the when they first started keeping the year old phone around the 3g and the 3gs
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:29.020]  You could tell them apart because the eye the word iphone on the back was written. Yes shiny letters instead of flat letters
[01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:32.140]  Well people want to show they have the new one right as part of the esteem of having the new one
[01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:36.940]  It's part of the esteem of having the new iphone, right? No, I totally think so, you know, and
[01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:43.260]  It's an apple wants to enable that so that's why I think that you know, I don't know if I don't know if an iphone
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:45.740]  um
[01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:51.020]  6c would be plastic like the 5c like I wouldn't be surprised if it's metal
[01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:55.340]  Or and rounded, you know with rounded corners like the 6s and 6 plus
[01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:59.260]  But just the size of it would tell you that it's you know, the lesser model
[01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:03.420]  Yeah, it was funny with the iphone 5 even though apple rebuilt it from the adams on up
[01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:07.500]  It was boring, but the minute they made it in gold, you know people first made fun of it and then everyone complained
[01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:09.500]  They couldn't get one
[01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:14.940]  Did you you know, yeah, it's still hard to get and uh
[01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:23.020]  Iphones. Yeah, like there's there's still I didn't know that until I was listening to atp and heard syracusea talking about it
[01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:27.180]  It's yeah supply still hasn't caught up with demand
[01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:32.060]  Milton has been trying to get them for weeks. And I think he had to finally call in favors to try to get them shipped to
[01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:39.180]  That makes me laugh well, it's hilarious because people who leave apple have no idea how to get a like how normal people get their phones
[01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:44.220]  Like they just they've never had to deal with carriers or with retail stores or and it sounds like some of them
[01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:48.540]  You know as much as I love them. They're just a little inadequate and equipped to deal with the horrors of retail shopping
[01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:54.380]  Yeah, let me see here if I get a
[01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:58.540]  Six and I get it in space gray. I get it on verizon
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:06.060]  If I want well, it looks like I can get I can get
[01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:11.020]  128 gigs is available three to five business days
[01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:17.500]  I think the six plus is still harder than the six. Yeah, but they're starting to fall into more about which is crazy
[01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:19.500]  I mean as much as people complain about
[01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:22.140]  About the iphone you still can't get them
[01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:25.340]  There's their complete their supply constraint for months after launch. Yeah
[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:28.300]  Just crazy
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:33.980]  And I think that's you know, but I still think that's pretty interesting that they're at a point where they still don't catch up
[01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:38.380]  In supply demand until after the holiday. Yeah
[01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:44.220]  And year after year or two, it's not a diminishing thing. They're making more and more money off the iphone. Yeah
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:49.820]  What's left? I guess we have the last event of the year, which would be the ipad air
[01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:53.740]  Two. Yes, and you know semity. Oh and the retina iMac. Yeah
[01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:58.460]  Retina iMac is the only one that really sticks out to me. I still I love the ipad air, too
[01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:05.020]  I still think I think it's an amazing device, but it's it's a refinement of the ipad air whereas the
[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:12.860]  The retina 5k mac is to me like a new a new era the two things that are similar to me about those devices
[01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:17.500]  Are that with the ipad air 2 apple started making their own gpu's, you know, like an anti-con, you know
[01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:20.940]  Like an antique first thought it was a six core. Um
[01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:23.020]  imagination
[01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:27.740]  Chip and they later realized that it was an eight core one which it was totally theoretical until apple made it
[01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:29.180]  It wasn't just a design
[01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:31.740]  They actually took the architecture and built their own custom gpu
[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:36.860]  And they've been doing cpus for a couple generations like they had swift and they had cyclone now they have cyclone, too
[01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:41.820]  But now they're doing the entire chip almost is in-house at apple
[01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:45.580]  And then you look at the iMac and they made the timing controller
[01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:49.660]  Right where that they made 5k possible in that computer when intel has not yet shipped
[01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:56.140]  Skylake or or thunderbolt 3 or anything so they are there again. They're making more and more of the internals of their machines
[01:30:56.700 --> 01:31:04.780]  yeah, and that's interesting to me that they've done it for the iMac because they've they've they've had this economy of scale with ios devices
[01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:09.820]  Because even as they've expanded the lineups and they've gone out of two iphone sizes
[01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:15.340]  And they've gone out of two iphone sizes and you know, there's two ipad sizes
[01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:20.060]  And there are cellular and non-cellular versions of the ipads
[01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:26.880]  But for the most part it's still in terms of what's actually new this year. It's a very limited number of skus
[01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:32.460]  Right and and they share a lot of stuff, you know that the iphone 6 and 6 plus
[01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:39.680]  Are really very very there's a slight difference in the camera where the the 6 plus camera has optical image stabilization
[01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:43.520]  So that's a different part, but it's the same a8 cpu
[01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:49.340]  And it's you know, just the stuff that has to be different. It's different, you know different display
[01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:53.740]  Because it's a different size and it's different pixels
[01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:57.020]  But that they've you know
[01:31:57.020 --> 01:32:02.540]  They had this great economy of scale which lets them do these things like you're saying like build their own systems on a chip
[01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:07.740]  And not share it with the rest of the you know, have these things that aren't available to anybody else in the industry
[01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:14.140]  It's interesting to me that they've done it with the iMac too, which is clearly lower volume. I mean without question
[01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:20.540]  I mean, I think all iMacs together are are just dropping the bucket volume wise compared to ipad or
[01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:26.380]  any iphone or ipad model, but the retina one in particular existing only at the top of the
[01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:30.540]  Product what do you call it the product?
[01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:38.060]  The pyramid. Yeah, the pyramid right? It's only the best option the good and better ones are still non-retina because the retina display
[01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:46.700]  You know, it's it's this weird combination where it's you know in one sense it's remarkably inexpensive because
[01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:50.540]  Famously like Dell has a 5k display. Didn't they come out with a 5k display?
[01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:53.740]  They yeah, they came out with a month or so ago, but it requires two
[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:59.500]  Displayport connections, but it costs as much it costs as much or more as the whole iMac. Yes, right
[01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:01.340]  So Dell came out with a 5k display
[01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:03.740]  We're just the display and forget about whether you need you know
[01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:07.900]  How you're gonna actually run it and that you need to display ports and all that. How are you gonna get graphics cards?
[01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:11.740]  How are you gonna get how's everything gonna work? Just forget about it. Just the display itself
[01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:16.540]  Costs as much as the whole iMac which includes a pretty killer computer. Yeah
[01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:22.540]  And the crazy thing is Apple if you asked me for you know, ten years ago, you know, Apple's not a chip fab
[01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:24.060]  They're not an Intel. They're not a TMCH
[01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:29.020]  They're not any one of these companies and they got to 64-bit first and now they're they're making chips that are just
[01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:32.460]  Pushing the industry forward and they're not a peripheral maker
[01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:37.260]  But they're with the original IPS iMac and now with the 5k iMac they're making displays
[01:33:37.260 --> 01:33:44.700]  That's just pushing the industry forward and the the iPad air 2 is so overpowered that you could arguably say, you know guys relax stop
[01:33:44.700 --> 01:33:49.340]  but instead of that Apple's just saying run get as far ahead as fast as you can and just keep going just
[01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:54.060]  push the state of this technology because it will filter down and we will figure out a way to make all this stuff super
[01:33:54.380 --> 01:34:02.540]  Super important and to do things that nobody else can do. Yeah, and that's it's turning the industry's model on its head
[01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:07.180]  Where from the outset from the very beginning of personal computing?
[01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:14.700]  through recently the model was that it's you know, this commodity market where you buy
[01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:22.060]  CPUs from Intel you buy graphics cards from Nvidia or you know, whoever else
[01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:29.580]  Radion, I guess it you know, but there'd be graphics companies. There'd be memory makers, you know, there'd be
[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:35.180]  Hard drive makers and you would just put all the you know, if you wanted to make a computer you'd pick and choose you get the salad bar
[01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:38.220]  Right, I guess yeah, it's totally like a salad bar
[01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:42.540]  But everybody else could get them too and you could make deals and depending on your volume
[01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:49.580]  I'm sure you know Dell and HP as higher volume vendors would have some sort of leverage and priority versus
[01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:52.220]  You know a smaller
[01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:55.420]  by market share PC maker, you know, but
[01:34:55.420 --> 01:35:01.020]  It was that the what you were possible. What what was possible to do though was
[01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:07.020]  Limited by these specialists. So if you wanted to drive a 5k display
[01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:11.020]  You were limited unless you could get
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:17.580]  Somebody, you know that less the state of the art in the graphics industry was a graphics card that could push that many
[01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:20.140]  pixels and a connector
[01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:22.140]  that
[01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:30.140]  Could carry them whereas apple has started turning things like that on its head and it doesn't matter if the industry can't do it
[01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:33.180]  Yet the state of the art in the industry. They just made their own
[01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:37.340]  And made it work. Yeah, and it's not available to anybody else
[01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:42.140]  That's the in like you said like to do things that other people can't do
[01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:44.860]  What goes back to your only apple?
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:46.860]  piece from wbdc
[01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:50.380]  Yeah, I think it's you know, probably the best way to do it
[01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:53.180]  Yeah, I think it's you know, probably the best piece I wrote this year
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:56.700]  I think it's the only one that or at least the one that has the most staying value
[01:35:57.340 --> 01:36:01.180]  And even lo these many months later. I think it's it's if anything I underplayed it
[01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:05.820]  Yeah, and I think it's true and I think when we like next year we already mentioned maybe there's a bigger ipad
[01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:10.460]  but maybe there's software and services that go along with that and having two gigs and having
[01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:14.780]  An octa core gpu makes a lot more sense, you know next year than it makes this year
[01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:20.380]  But it allows people who buy the brand new ipad air this year to not feel left behind when the newer devices are newer software
[01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:22.140]  ships
[01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:27.580]  I and I still can't I keep thinking about 64-bit for mobile and you know, nobody else has it yet
[01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:32.700]  I mean, there's some chips that are possible capable of it out for android, but it certainly is far from mainstream
[01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:33.020]  Yeah
[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:37.820]  the nexus 9 I think ship with it just because they they decided they had to have they couldn't wait any longer to
[01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:42.380]  To get 64-bit out the door, but it's not in it's not arm. It's intel, right?
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:44.860]  it's the nexus 9 I think is uh
[01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:49.820]  X 84 x86. I think no, I think it's qualcomm, but i'd have to double check
[01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:53.660]  I don't know what either way though. It certainly isn't like a mainstream thing
[01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:57.900]  But to me it's it's 64-bit came out and people complained. Oh, there's no four gigabytes of memory
[01:36:57.900 --> 01:37:01.820]  Apple's just wasting it but it turns out that the arm v8 instruction set was so much better
[01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:05.340]  And the security that they could use enabled all the touch id stuff
[01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:10.220]  There was just so many other things about building that chipset that 64-bit was almost a bonus for them
[01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:15.420]  The same way three cores on the iphone 6 is almost a bonus and eight cores on the eye on the ipad air, too
[01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:18.700]  They're doing it because they can there's no reason not to so why shouldn't we do it?
[01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:24.620]  Right. It just goes hand in hand with the the new instruction set which is really where the performance wins come from
[01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:32.220]  Not the mat not any sort of magical going from 32 to 64 on any hypothetical platform magically makes things better
[01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:36.300]  It wasn't like that. It was a very very practical, you know arm
[01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:41.180]  The new arm instruction set is way better. It gets rid of all sorts of legacy cruft
[01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:46.540]  You know that dates back to the early days of arm when it was powering things like the newton
[01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:51.980]  Yeah, and you know palm pilots and stuff like that and way more registers. It's just so many benefits
[01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:58.460]  Right and everything that the the computer engineers have learned since then about how to make efficient
[01:37:58.700 --> 01:38:02.060]  You know instruction sets for for computers and you know
[01:38:02.060 --> 01:38:07.500]  for computers and you know and what what is it that a modern compiler wants to see
[01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:12.620]  in an instruction set to to generate efficient code and it was you know
[01:38:13.340 --> 01:38:21.020]  Rewritten from scratch with all this cruft gone and all sorts of new stuff to help modern compilers, you know in there
[01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:27.180]  And here we are over a year later and apple is still the only mainstream, you know device that has it
[01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:30.860]  And we have swift and we have metal. So when you put those technologies all together
[01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:33.680]  Eventually, the performance is going to be way beyond what just the hardware delivers
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:37.260]  Yeah, and I think that those two things, you know
[01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:42.720]  Swift is obviously new for 2014. Uh metal is new for 2014
[01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:45.660]  and
[01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:53.340]  I think they get to the heart of like what what what is apple going to be like as a big company with with
[01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:56.380]  big weapons to swing around
[01:38:56.380 --> 01:39:03.100]  And you know, obviously like I said like the watch the the canary in the coal fund i'm looking for is hubris, you know
[01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:08.300]  And obviously when a company gets bigger it tries to do more on its own. I mean microsoft famously, you know
[01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:10.380]  It does everything on its own. Um
[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:15.020]  You know their own, you know, they're the only company that you just backed, you know
[01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:19.900]  Just little details like that. They use backslashes instead of slashes between directory paths
[01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:23.260]  To you know having had their own
[01:39:23.260 --> 01:39:25.260]  Having had their own
[01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:29.580]  You know developer tool chain and their own programming language, you know
[01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:36.700]  For you know, but they did more than that though. I feel like when microsoft was at its height, you know in the 90s
[01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:40.860]  you know, it was the fact that they expanded into things like uh,
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:48.380]  Co-ownership of slate.com the founding of msnbc, you know that they wanted to own a cable news network
[01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:53.740]  you think right what why would microsoft want to get involved in cable news, you know, but
[01:39:54.780 --> 01:40:01.020]  I feel like apple as they try to do more and more on their own. It's only in the name of enabling features
[01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:05.100]  That would be better for the products. They're already making right like for enterprise
[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:09.820]  They didn't decide to create an enterprise company or buy an enterprise company. They partnered with ibm to let them do what they did
[01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:11.420]  well
[01:40:11.420 --> 01:40:14.700]  Right. No, that's a great. Yeah, that's a great example of that
[01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:20.220]  they didn't create this new enterprise division within apple, which is outside their expertise and
[01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:26.540]  And risks losing their focus, you know, if tim cook wants this, you know wants to make a big bet and
[01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:31.900]  And do this so he doesn't have to spend anywhere near as much attention on it as you know
[01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:35.900]  As he would in this world where they're willing to say, you know what? We just want
[01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:38.620]  Our devices to be used in the enterprise
[01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:42.940]  We'll let ibm handle how to make the sales and how to write these, you know
[01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:45.980]  These apps that are meant for that market. It's a perfect example
[01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:50.940]  Yeah, much better than buying sap or something that you know, the imaginary people always want apple to buy
[01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:58.780]  Right and swift, you know is an example where they're not they didn't create a new programming language to change computer science
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:02.940]  it's not you know, if anything the critiques from people who are like
[01:41:03.580 --> 01:41:10.460]  Programming language critics is that it's sort of a boring language. There's nothing outlandish about it. There's nothing
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:12.540]  novel about it
[01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:13.500]  um
[01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:20.300]  It's just a nice simple language, you know in terms not not that there aren't clever things under the hood and like the fact that
[01:41:21.260 --> 01:41:22.780]  um
[01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:23.900]  You know
[01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:28.940]  Most of the language that's designed is is defined in the runtime not in the language itself
[01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:32.860]  The language itself is super super minimal. There's something, you know artistic about that
[01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:36.780]  But effectively it's just what kind of programming language would you write?
[01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:42.220]  Would you want to enable the sort of software that apple wants to run?
[01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:45.580]  That's it. It's just a very very practical language
[01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:50.060]  You know and what would you get when you have a language that's
[01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:56.940]  Led by the compiler guy chris latner or a company that lets the compiler guy leave the language
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:42:00.300]  Right, but it's sort of the opposite of the sort of hoity-toity
[01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:07.340]  Hoity-toity academic languages that you know with the new programming languages that I remember when I was young and in college in the 90s
[01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:08.780]  Where it was all
[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:14.060]  Led it was you know, the the the practical utility then was completely abstracted. It was all
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:19.100]  Philosophical in terms of what was driving the decisions behind them
[01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:22.460]  Yeah, it's a language designed to be used by apple and and sooner rather than later
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:27.820]  Yes, very much. So and very much designed, you know as
[01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:30.080]  Syracuse has pointed out on atp
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:36.880]  It's we've already one thing we've got that is not going to budge is we've already got these frameworks the cocoa frameworks
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:41.680]  And in theory if they were going to start with all new frameworks, maybe they'd come up with a all new language
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:45.680]  But it's if we've got these frameworks that are you know, have these, you know
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:50.160]  That are already designed and already have these these, you know design patterns
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:53.600]  What type of new language would we use that would best leverage them?
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:58.480]  And that's one of the things that I really like about the way that apple is running now is they're not they don't have to
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:00.640]  Restart everything again. They can do something like
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:04.400]  Add llvm and add swift and do these things that
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:09.360]  Take them further without having to destroy or stop or played an artificial break between what they had before
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:13.600]  It's like they're swapping the parts behind the scenes and if you're not paying attention, you might not even see it
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:16.320]  But it gives them tremendous benefit over time. Yeah
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:19.840]  and metal likewise, you know, it's it's
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:24.640]  It's the only it's the sort of thing you can only do when you have a big user base
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:29.440]  I mean Microsoft famously has done that with the DirectX, you know, we're Mike, you know
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:34.320]  And it's you know sustained to this day that their leadership in PC gaming, you know
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:39.360]  If that there's probably no area of computing where they're stronger than PC gaming
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:43.680]  And they're able to say here's you know, here's the graphics language
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:48.000]  you're going to use and that's it and they can do that because they've got the
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.080]  They've got the the footprint
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:53.200]  Apple couldn't do metal, you know
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:56.800]  10 years ago with the mac. I mean, it's still not on the mac
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:44:01.620]  But they couldn't and I don't think they could have I don't think it would have really taken off in 2008 or 2009
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:08.800]  They really needed that massive hundreds of millions of users base and this you know
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:14.240]  this de facto position is like the leading handheld gaming market and now
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:17.680]  It it's not like they're forcing it down developers throats. They're
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:22.640]  You know, you don't have to use it. It's not like they're they've said like oh next year
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:26.000]  If you don't use if your game isn't using Swift, it won't be in the App Store
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:31.360]  it's something developers want to use though because you know, it's it
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.880]  Gives them better performance and lets them hit, you know
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:38.720]  a huge number of their users and it was something that they could announce at
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:43.280]  WWDC while they were announcing that I forget the four or five biggest game engines in the world were all
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:50.240]  supporting it. So for most developers they quote-unquote get it for free because the engine that they're already using is just now getting the benefits of all of that.
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:51.600]  Right.
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:53.600]  Right, and it's definitely a
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:57.200]  Yeah, like I said, it's in broad strokes
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:00.960]  it's the sort of thing Apple could only do now that they're big and
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:06.000]  the market leader and that wouldn't it just wasn't possible in the old days when they were
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:11.440]  the the little guy on the sides when the when the adobes and microsofts could say no, we're not going to support your
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:12.960]  your
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:16.240]  Rhapsody. Yeah, that's a you know, perfect example, right?
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:18.880]  Although the Rhapsody thing was a little bit more
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:24.800]  It's funny because they were a little bit more adamant back then where their initial proposal with adamant
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:28.400]  With Rhapsody was you're going to rewrite your apps in cocoa
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:32.560]  Or else you have to run in this little little ghetto
[01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:35.600]  Environment
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:39.760]  Whereas, you know even with Swift, like I said, they're not saying you have to use Swift
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:41.760]  Even though they could
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:42.560]  Really?
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:46.480]  I mean, I think they could get away with it. But you know, they're not because I feel like there's
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:50.400]  A humility to them
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:52.960]  Yeah, I mean absolutely and you get people like, you know
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:56.880]  Brent Simmons now we get to play around with it and blog about all their experiences with it and it benefits everybody
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:01.520]  It's almost like a built-in they don't do betas the way Google does but the way they're releasing it gives a lot of people
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:05.840]  A lot of time to weigh in beyond the five and then a hundred people at Apple who knew about it
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:12.800]  Let me take a break here and thank our third and final sponsor of the show and it's our good friends at hover
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:15.440]  H-o-v-e-r
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:24.480]  Hover is and I say this without any hesitation the world's best way to manage and buy domain names
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:31.200]  They're a domain registrar and they're the best they really are they've been around for a long time
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:35.920]  They've been around for a long time. They've been around I think 15 years maybe even more
[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:43.440]  They have tremendous customer service they have a no gimmick no upsell
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:49.600]  No, scammy buying process. They have great search for domain names
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:51.040]  They have great tools to help you
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:55.760]  If the one you're looking for your first gas is the domain name you want you type it in ends up
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:57.440]  It's already taken ends up
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:01.440]  None of the the top level domains where it's available or what you want
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:06.000]  They have great tools to help you find one a similar domain name that you do want
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:14.160]  In less than five minutes with hover you can find the domain name you want get it up and running
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:17.680]  All you have to do is search for keywords and they'll show you the best options
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:24.960]  If you've ever registered a domain name anywhere else and i'm guessing that the number of listeners of this show who who own
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:27.280]  Just one domain name is probably minimal
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:31.840]  I mean, I think most of the people like me are probably have a problem and have too many domain names
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:35.680]  Most of them unused but if you've ever registered a domain name anywhere else
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:41.760]  You know that most of the other registrars out there make it a really unpleasant experience
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:45.120]  They make it complicated just to buy what you really need
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:48.960]  They try to upsell you with stuff you don't need on your way to the shopping cart
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:52.800]  you have to double check that they haven't already inserted something that you don't want in there and
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:58.560]  They make you pay extra to upgrade for things that should be included like who is privacy?
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:04.240]  Like you don't have to pay extra to hover to get your uh, who is uh record made private
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:07.760]  It's just part of the service that they offer because who wouldn't want it made private
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:09.840]  uh
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:10.800]  because
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:16.320]  I remember years ago used to be your who is registry had to have your home phone number in it or an active working phone
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:18.080]  number and then
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:23.120]  Uh telemarketers could just go through who has records and get a you know, a list of working phone numbers
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.160]  You don't want that you want uh privacy
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:28.720]  Hover just gives it to you for free
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:32.400]  Here's the most amazing thing though this I say this every time that they sponsor the show
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:38.720]  They have what they call part of their technical support is free valet transfer service
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:45.040]  so if you've already got domains at some other registrar if you're willing to give hover your
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:48.480]  Login information to your to your registry account at the other registrar
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:52.980]  They will just move your domains over from your old registrar
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:55.680]  to your new one at hover
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:49:00.000]  And take care of all the stuff that needs to be changed the dns and all that stuff
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:05.360]  This is all their their valet transfer people do they're experts in moving domains
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:10.480]  You like me probably are not an expert in moving domains and when you do it
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:13.120]  You make a mistake with dns you can ruin your day
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:17.040]  You can ruin your day. You could knock your website offline for the day before
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:20.720]  When you fix it propagates to everywhere that got the bad stuff
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:26.960]  Just amazing no wait, no hold no transfer technical support
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:32.560]  You just call them up you call them up on the phone and they answer the phone like a person answers the phone
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:36.400]  Amazing. So where do you go to find out more?
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:38.560]  Go to hover.com

[01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:16.260]  So my thanks to hover
[01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:19.460]  Drink any good scotch lately renee, uh only when i'm out with you and guy
[01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:24.260]  That's the time when I get the bourbon in the scotch. I don't think i've had any scotch lately
[01:50:25.940 --> 01:50:30.020]  Or if I do I don't remember it's the lack of christmas apple events. Yeah
[01:50:30.020 --> 01:50:32.020]  Yeah, um
[01:50:32.180 --> 01:50:35.540]  So that's it though, I think what else is up for 2014 in review
[01:50:35.780 --> 01:50:38.900]  I think there's sort of two things that we could touch on just quickly. One is the
[01:50:39.780 --> 01:50:46.660]  Tim cook beyond just running at apple, but the the moves he's made towards the inclusivity and towards equal opportunity. Oh the liberties
[01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:51.540]  I can't believe I didn't think of that. I think that's it's absolutely been a big year for that
[01:50:52.340 --> 01:50:56.260]  Yeah that his essay. I think was just absolutely pitch perfect. Um,
[01:50:56.260 --> 01:51:00.580]  Just uh his own version of you know thoughts on and but it was so much more personal
[01:51:01.860 --> 01:51:07.460]  Yeah, I think even if he hadn't written that and come out himself as gay this year
[01:51:07.780 --> 01:51:09.940]  I I think it would still be worth talking about
[01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:16.500]  The like you said inclusivity and etc that that he's led and that apple has pushed this year
[01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:20.420]  It's terrific and it reminds me of the story that I heard
[01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:24.900]  You know with scott forestall where he really wanted to make apple a more inclusive company
[01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:27.460]  And he believed that you in order to hire more
[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:31.140]  With more diversity you had to have more diversity in the hiring process
[01:51:31.140 --> 01:51:33.940]  So when he would get they had terrific female engineers
[01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:37.540]  I mean vicki murley famously but terrific female engineers on the safari team, for example
[01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:42.260]  And they would they would not only send them on their resumes, but they would send them out to you know
[01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:47.380]  on the job hunts to the to the colleges because they knew that they would come back with a different perspective and
[01:51:47.780 --> 01:51:50.420]  We we haven't seen tremendous spread of that effect
[01:51:50.420 --> 01:51:55.940]  We haven't seen a huge swing in the amount of women or minorities and in jobs in silicon valley
[01:51:55.940 --> 01:52:01.300]  But we have seen improvements and I think with apple's report as disappointing as the results might be to many people
[01:52:01.860 --> 01:52:06.180]  The exposure that it gets and the willingness for people to want to make it better. I think we're huge this year
[01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:11.700]  Yeah, and I think it's again another one of those things where I think you can really just take
[01:52:12.260 --> 01:52:16.180]  Tim cook at his word. Yeah, and it's no euphemism
[01:52:16.260 --> 01:52:19.460]  It's not just you know, trying to say what people want to hear
[01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:23.380]  What people want to hear I think he means it where a he thinks it's just right
[01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:29.620]  It's just the right thing to do but be that that that fierce competitor in him. You can tell when he says it that
[01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:33.780]  It's there's there's obviously so much untapped talent
[01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:36.420]  outside
[01:52:36.420 --> 01:52:42.580]  The white male engineer, you know, yeah whites and asians, you know that everybody else women
[01:52:43.140 --> 01:52:44.580]  people of color
[01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:47.140]  uh men and women, uh, it's
[01:52:47.140 --> 01:52:51.860]  The talent is out there and apple is starved for talent and they want it
[01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:55.460]  you know, so there's in addition to the the the
[01:52:56.180 --> 01:52:58.580]  Justice angle, you know that it's the way it should be
[01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:04.100]  that that people don't feel welcome in the industry, but it there's also just a purely
[01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:06.980]  competitive aspect to it
[01:53:07.060 --> 01:53:12.020]  It's it was that beautiful moment too with tim cook when they were at the shareholders meeting and the guy stood up and he said
[01:53:12.020 --> 01:53:16.360]  Why are you wasting basically said why are you wasting my money on environmentalism and accessibility?
[01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:21.560]  Accessibility and tim cook said, you know that this stuff matters and if you don't think it matters just get the hell out of the stock
[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:24.040]  Right. It was the guy brought up roi
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:31.240]  Investment and you know and it was fascinating, you know that that cook got as angry as he did and said
[01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:34.440]  Everything we do isn't about the bloody our roi
[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:39.560]  Yeah, and it's funny that he said bloody because he's you know, clearly he's not british, but he's the cool one
[01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:42.200]  Right, like we'd expect that from steve jobs. Steve jobs was bombastic
[01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:47.800]  But tim cook always looked like he would just sit there with laser beams in his eyes and that for him is hugely emotional
[01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:54.040]  Right. It wouldn't be surprising if tim cook. I mean if steve jobs had gotten angry at a shareholder
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:59.880]  Yeah, whereas tim cook is the guy you'd think no matter what any crackpot shareholder would say he's not going to get angry
[01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:05.880]  But he did that clearly angered him and again like when uh, I think it was the financial times that named him their
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:11.640]  CEO of the year there was somebody there was a couple yes so far but the one that I linked to I remember that they led
[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:18.200]  Their their here's why with that anecdote and I think in hindsight it was the most telling anecdote of the year
[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:20.120]  You know in terms of tim cook
[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:25.560]  Uh being unscripted. Yes, you know, I think in terms of what was scripted and what was planned
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:27.720]  his um
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:33.320]  You know his coming out essay in business week was probably it but that moment at the shareholders meeting I think was the most telling
[01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:35.560]  impromptu moment
[01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:40.360]  Yeah, and you know, it really made me think it's strange to say but it made me think a lot more of tim cook because you
[01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:46.760]  Know it is hard to tell he is so controlled in public and so on message and so on point and he's such he's so gifted
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:52.840]  As a thinker and someone who's controls logistics and all these things to see his emotional response sort of added
[01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:56.040]  A whole new dimension to him as not just a ceo but a person
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:54:59.160]  yeah, I think absolutely and
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:02.360]  You know and I think that's it
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:06.600]  It it's also a to me a sign of the long-term thinking
[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:14.760]  That the apple, you know under jobs, you know constantly, you know consistently since since the in the post next
[01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:22.760]  Reunification era, you know that they've been a long-term company that's looking at building a company that's going to be here for 50 or 100 years
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:27.080]  Uh, you know that's going to outlive everybody who's at the company today
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:32.680]  You know and there's I really do think that that's what they're looking at that they're trying to build an institution that's going to still be
[01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:38.840]  Here when tim cook and phil shiller and angela arntz are all long retired and you know
[01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:47.400]  Frankly in the grave. Yeah, and how do you do that? Well, you don't do it by sweating the roi on every single thing you do
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:49.560]  Yeah
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:54.360]  And it's you know, the other thing too it that and I think it's probably what burned him up is
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:56:00.280]  It's not like apple, you know has dipped into low profit margins and that they're still spending money
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:02.840]  I think it was in particular with the uh,
[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:05.640]  The the clean energy for the data centers
[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:13.880]  And spending money on thing, you know worrying about things like their environmental impact on global warming or climate change
[01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:15.880]  Whatever you want to call it
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:20.600]  Carbon footprint. Yeah, it definitely struck a chord with him. It was a good chord to have been struck
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:23.800]  Uh, and you know the whole, you know, social
[01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:31.800]  Equality angle is has clearly I don't think steve jobs was against it, but it's you know
[01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:37.640]  Apple is clearly as a company is clearly more outspoken about it now than they were under him
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:43.560]  Well job seemed to believe that all that stuff was deeply personal charity charitable donations and support for causes was something that he believed
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:48.600]  That apple paying that people could let people spend their own money on but it wasn't at a corporate level where tim cook
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:54.040]  You know, he he took apple on the gay pride parade. He's put apple behind equal employment legislation
[01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:59.880]  He's really believed that the power and and wealth of apple can be used for more than just generating more power and wealth
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:01.800]  Yeah
[01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:02.840]  Yeah
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:06.920]  Absolutely. All right. And what was your second thing? My second thing was I was going to talk about the app store stuff
[01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:08.920]  But I feel like it's a bit of a downer at the end now
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:11.480]  Yeah, maybe we did them in the wrong order
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:15.480]  Well, we should still do it. Well, we'll let whiskers fix it. Okay
[01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:17.480]  Right with the
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:23.000]  Well the today view widgets right this that people you know
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:28.120]  in short it was like apple introduced these today view widgets and
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:33.800]  At wwdc and then you know, I think they might have even literally said we can't wait to see what you guys do with them
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:35.080]  yeah, and
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:40.040]  Then they saw what people were doing with them and rejected a whole bunch of the most
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:45.240]  Clever versions of them. Um, who I was it
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:50.860]  Was it I think it was james thompson's pcalc. Yeah, that was simultaneously
[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:53.480]  being promoted
[01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:55.800]  In the app store with a banner
[01:57:56.520 --> 01:58:01.080]  For great new uses of today view widgets because it was he added a calculator
[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:03.960]  so you without even opening the app right in the today view if you
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:07.480]  If you put the pcalc widget in you could just do your calculation right there
[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:11.560]  It was being promoted as a great new widget at the same time
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:17.960]  That like the review team had contacted him and said you know what that's outside the bounds of what we intended to be enabled
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:20.200]  So you're going to have to submit a new build that takes that out
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:25.720]  I mean it sounds from the outside. It looks absolutely insane and I think it's worth explaining not to excuse it
[01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:29.160]  But sort of to explain it so extensibility is one of the things that we've been talking about
[01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:34.760]  So extensibility is this huge new feature and everyone is trying to ship iOS 8 and developers are trying to get their apps approved
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:37.800]  And app review is it's the worst time of the year to work in app review
[01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:41.640]  And they bring in as many people as they can and they try to get as many apps as possible
[01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:45.560]  Onto the store and as soon as an app is approved and this is all under phil shiller's org
[01:58:45.720 --> 01:58:51.320]  That is that moves to eddie q's org where they have app editorial and they need to program the entire app store
[01:58:51.560 --> 01:58:54.600]  Promotion for all that stuff and all they see is approved. They have no idea what they're doing
[01:58:54.600 --> 01:58:59.880]  What might be going on behind the scenes its flag is approved. It's fine for editorial and then when things sort of slow down again
[01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:04.760]  People who are higher up in app store review who have a lot of ideas about what they believe, you know
[01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:10.040]  They sincerely believe that certain things about experience and whether a button will confuse an average user or whether
[01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:14.840]  Someone is spending time in notification center and they're not supposed to it's supposed to be a quick conduit
[01:59:15.320 --> 01:59:20.040]  And they care a lot about these things and they'll flag it and then it'll get removed and it won't work
[01:59:20.040 --> 01:59:25.320]  Any sense and developers will appeal and it'll go to a higher level and it might end up on the executive review committee's desk
[01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:28.040]  And they might say it's fine, you know, stop worrying about it
[01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:33.880]  And but it I think extensibility was so new that it created a disconnect between what was technically possible
[01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:41.160]  And what people who had been in app review, you know, at a slightly higher level for many years thought should be the experience on the system
[01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:48.040]  Yeah, I I think that's a very good way to put it and I think that's a very good way to put it and I think that's a very good way to put it
[01:59:48.040 --> 01:59:51.240]  I think that's a very good way to put it and I think maybe the transmit
[01:59:52.200 --> 01:59:53.720]  um
[01:59:53.720 --> 01:59:58.440]  It was transmit right? Yeah. Yeah that had the sharing to uh
[01:59:59.640 --> 02:00:06.360]  Storage services like box.net and dropbox and ik cloud drive
[02:00:07.320 --> 02:00:08.360]  um
[02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:09.880]  you know that
[02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:15.900]  Completely within the the they didn't they didn't use any non-private or non-public apis
[02:00:15.900 --> 02:00:20.220]  all public apis the sharing sheet itself the the
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:24.060]  What's it called move to whatever you want to call it send to send to?
[02:00:24.780 --> 02:00:26.380]  um
[02:00:26.380 --> 02:00:29.180]  They don't have any control over it's part of that whole
[02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:31.980]  um
[02:00:32.460 --> 02:00:38.220]  Inner application communication that that enables so many of these continuity features and sharing features one sheet
[02:00:38.300 --> 02:00:42.700]  They can't line item veto certain services, right? Because the system is drawing it which is
[02:00:42.700 --> 02:00:48.140]  Why apple is opening up seemingly opening up and letting you do these things that you couldn't do before?
[02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:56.540]  And then they were told you can't you can't do this for icloud drive you can't send anything you you can't send anything
[02:00:56.540 --> 02:00:59.500]  That wasn't created in your your own app to icloud drive
[02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:05.100]  Which meant like you said because you don't have line item veto on the services that are listed
[02:01:05.340 --> 02:01:11.980]  That you had to take out the whole thing and now the app couldn't send to anybody including dropbox or box or anybody who?
[02:01:11.980 --> 02:01:13.820]  Apple doesn't care about
[02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:20.860]  Whereas it almost seemed like it was exactly why they added the send to in the first place so that you could do things like that
[02:01:21.420 --> 02:01:25.180]  It's again when you look at it from certain perspective and i'm not supporting this perspective
[02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:26.540]  But I know it's almost thing like you know
[02:01:26.540 --> 02:01:31.660]  I understand is that they didn't they don't want the line item veto because they think that there can be disputes within companies that
[02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:37.420]  Would cause one company to sort of remove a competitor or remove a service and that's not to the benefit of the user
[02:01:37.420 --> 02:01:41.980]  But the original model on mac it's the same like there was apple made a calculator widget for os 10
[02:01:41.980 --> 02:01:47.340]  They didn't make one for ios for a variety of reasons, but they thought it wasn't the right experience. So they deliberately didn't make one
[02:01:48.220 --> 02:01:52.380]  Then you know james thompson who's a phenomenal developer did make one for icloud drive on the mac
[02:01:52.380 --> 02:01:53.740]  You could put any arbitrary file there
[02:01:53.740 --> 02:01:58.060]  But on ios it was sort of understood that you could only put files that you created or edited
[02:01:58.380 --> 02:02:03.660]  Because that meant the user knew that they were in your app and was working on them and they would understand it was in that space
[02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:08.060]  But then something like transit comes along which is the you know, quote-unquote steve jobs unforeseen thing
[02:02:08.380 --> 02:02:12.300]  And it's taken to the level where they can say this isn't what we intended it for it to do
[02:02:12.540 --> 02:02:17.500]  But it's not taken to the level of thinking. Well, is it a good thing anyway, like should we let it in anyway?
[02:02:17.820 --> 02:02:22.460]  So it gets rejected then it gets appealed then it gets overturned and it makes apple look horrible in the press
[02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:27.020]  It stresses out the developers and it affects the features that customers believe that they've paid for
[02:02:27.580 --> 02:02:30.140]  And you don't have paid for and it's just not a good outcome for anybody
[02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:35.660]  Yeah, but I do. Yeah, and if you like you said though, I think if you want to try to understand why it's that it's so
[02:02:35.660 --> 02:02:38.140]  New. Yeah, and there's so many moving pieces
[02:02:38.860 --> 02:02:40.860]  and
[02:02:40.860 --> 02:02:44.060]  You know the thing that made if you understood everything that was going on the thing that made
[02:02:44.700 --> 02:02:49.740]  Transmits and again transmit wasn't yanked from the app store. They got a you know, mostly friendly
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:54.940]  Notification that that they were told you need to submit a new build that takes this out
[02:02:55.420 --> 02:02:58.780]  You know and they couldn't wait forever. I'm sure they could do that
[02:02:58.780 --> 02:03:03.580]  They couldn't wait forever. I'm sure that at some point apple would you know, it's like two weeks usually I think yeah
[02:03:03.820 --> 02:03:05.260]  And you know, it's more or less, you know
[02:03:05.260 --> 02:03:09.900]  Take out those lines of code that do this test your new build and submit it and we'll do this
[02:03:10.620 --> 02:03:12.140]  um
[02:03:12.140 --> 02:03:14.780]  I don't think it's any surprise that it was the ios version
[02:03:15.500 --> 02:03:18.300]  That caused the problem now if you understood what was going on
[02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:23.820]  It didn't make any sense though because nothing you could do from the ios version no file that you could put
[02:03:24.380 --> 02:03:27.420]  Move from transmit to your iCloud drive
[02:03:27.420 --> 02:03:33.980]  You couldn't do the exact same thing on Yosemite. Yeah, you could do the exact same thing. So there was nothing that they were
[02:03:34.460 --> 02:03:35.900]  that that
[02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:40.060]  Whoever it was who thought they needed to not be able to do this from their ios app
[02:03:41.340 --> 02:03:47.740]  Was seemingly unaware that whatever it was that you would do whether it was a porno file or a illegally downloaded movie
[02:03:47.900 --> 02:03:52.220]  Or whatever it is that they were worried about was it copyright whatever or just stealing files?
[02:03:52.300 --> 02:03:56.460]  You know, you load an app and it starts taking your files and putting it on someone's server somewhere. Yes
[02:03:56.460 --> 02:04:01.260]  Um, it was all stuff that you could do right in the finder in Yosemite
[02:04:01.260 --> 02:04:06.300]  You can put whatever file you want your iCloud drive, you know in the same way that the finder doesn't keep you from moving
[02:04:06.300 --> 02:04:09.660]  You know a file from any folder anywhere to any other folder
[02:04:11.180 --> 02:04:16.620]  But I think it's understandable because that you know it the review teams and correct me if i'm wrong
[02:04:16.620 --> 02:04:22.140]  I think you might know more about their internal makeup, but the ios it's not like a review team. There's ios reviewers and mac
[02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:28.860]  Yes, and the ios reviewers are coming from a year's long history of you know
[02:04:28.860 --> 02:04:30.860]  What's restricted on ios?
[02:04:31.420 --> 02:04:35.020]  And moving files that weren't created in app
[02:04:35.500 --> 02:04:42.380]  Whatever your app is to anywhere else has always been forbidden and so it's you know, I could see how it even got high up
[02:04:43.260 --> 02:04:48.380]  Not to the highest levels but pretty high up and they thought no this has to be against the rules
[02:04:48.380 --> 02:04:52.460]  This isn't something that ios does I wrote a piece about this and one of the things I just wanted to
[02:04:52.860 --> 02:04:55.660]  And to help people understand is that when you say like apple rejected it
[02:04:56.220 --> 02:04:59.820]  Apple has these same discussions. Like if you listen to atp or you listen to the talk show
[02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:03.820]  That's the discussion that's happening inside apple as well and there's people advocating very strongly
[02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:09.260]  That these things should be allowed and there's people advocating saying this button here is going to confuse somebody they'll press it
[02:05:09.260 --> 02:05:13.420]  They'll suddenly be an app. They won't know where they are and they're not modeling it for me or you or you know
[02:05:13.420 --> 02:05:17.020]  Marco or john or somebody they're marketing it for our parents
[02:05:17.020 --> 02:05:24.700]  And you know our non-sophisticated tech-using relatives and they there are some people who are deeply deeply concerned that they have a very sensible
[02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:31.260]  Understandable experience now you could argue that widgets and extensibility in general is is a pretty nerdy feature and anyone using it
[02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:35.340]  Probably knows what they're doing and I think that's the argument that's winning out now
[02:05:35.340 --> 02:05:40.620]  But it really is these sorts of discussions and people want more rules sometimes on the app store
[02:05:40.620 --> 02:05:45.660]  But apple believes that the more my understanding is that apple believes that the more rules will actually chill out
[02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:51.980]  The more rules will actually chill innovation and they'd much rather see james thompson as annoying as it is make a calculator widget
[02:05:51.980 --> 02:05:58.140]  Have it rejected then have it approved then him to see a rule and just never make it or have to lobby for a change in the rule that might take years
[02:05:58.140 --> 02:06:02.780]  Because right now is ugly and as frustrating as the process was we have pcalc we have transmit
[02:06:03.020 --> 02:06:08.300]  We have all these things now officially on the store and we have these things officially clarified and it's only been like two months
[02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:10.140]  It's a good point
[02:06:10.140 --> 02:06:12.540]  Yeah, I would like to see and I wrote a thing about this
[02:06:12.540 --> 02:06:15.820]  But I would I think it would be great for everybody if there was a public facing
[02:06:16.460 --> 02:06:21.180]  Vice president of app store there is you know, there are really good directors of app stores. There's really good people in both
[02:06:21.900 --> 02:06:23.180]  Schiller and
[02:06:23.180 --> 02:06:27.100]  cues org but they're split over all these different organizations and much like
[02:06:27.740 --> 02:06:34.540]  Software development accelerated under federigi and stores are accelerating under angela erin's I think if there was somebody whose only job
[02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:41.100]  It was to make a fantastic experience on the app store whether it's making review better whether it's adding sloppy search
[02:06:41.100 --> 02:06:43.100]  You know finally to the app store
[02:06:43.260 --> 02:06:47.580]  But just someone who all you had to do is wake up every day and make developers and customers super happy
[02:06:47.900 --> 02:06:49.900]  I think that would improve the situation for everybody
[02:06:50.860 --> 02:06:51.900]  uh
[02:06:51.900 --> 02:06:56.460]  What's the word there's a word like uh newspapers sometimes have them
[02:06:57.160 --> 02:07:04.300]  Ombudsman's ombudsman. That's yeah. I was thinking the new york times doesn't call them an ombudsman. They call the uh, the public editor
[02:07:04.300 --> 02:07:11.820]  Yeah, only and and I my understanding of why is that for decades they rejected having an ombudsman and then when they finally added
[02:07:11.900 --> 02:07:14.940]  An ombudsman they didn't want to say, okay now we have an ombudsman
[02:07:14.940 --> 02:07:17.580]  They just call their ombudsman the public editor
[02:07:17.980 --> 02:07:19.980]  but the idea of the ombudsman is
[02:07:20.540 --> 02:07:25.820]  That at a newspaper, for example, the ombudsman doesn't is independent and doesn't report to the
[02:07:26.460 --> 02:07:28.460]  You know editor in chief of the newspaper
[02:07:28.460 --> 02:07:34.540]  and so a reader who has a problem with let's say the and it's some sort of bias in the coverage of anything can go to
[02:07:34.540 --> 02:07:40.460]  The ombudsman and the ombudsman can conduct like an independent review. I would love to see apple have
[02:07:42.700 --> 02:07:44.700]  An app store ombudsman, yeah
[02:07:45.500 --> 02:07:50.700]  You know and and you know, I guess I think the way to do it would be to to you know, write a blog
[02:07:52.140 --> 02:07:56.140]  And have a blog not not, you know, so it's not like anybody could
[02:07:56.140 --> 02:08:03.100]  Create an ombudsman issue the ombudsman would still get to choose what they wrote about but that they could look at something
[02:08:03.180 --> 02:08:05.180]  Like pcalc or transmit
[02:08:05.420 --> 02:08:10.620]  And you know not just like when I write about it or you write about it
[02:08:11.180 --> 02:08:16.380]  And kind of make a stink and hope somebody at apple reads our sites and does something about it
[02:08:16.380 --> 02:08:23.180]  But before going public with it the ombudsman could go inside and go to somebody and do the research
[02:08:23.180 --> 02:08:29.820]  And maybe get it clarified without the stink. Yeah, sort of de-escalate it before it hits the media and the executives
[02:08:31.020 --> 02:08:38.620]  Yeah, but then the ombudsman as somebody inside apple could then write a post that maybe explains what apple is thinking
[02:08:39.420 --> 02:08:45.900]  And again without making new rules and creating an ever more complicated set of uh guidelines for the app store
[02:08:46.460 --> 02:08:49.260]  At least sort of explain in plain english
[02:08:49.260 --> 02:08:54.060]  Here's the sort of things that are okay in a today view widget and here's the sort of things that aren't
[02:08:54.860 --> 02:09:00.300]  It's and I think that's a really good idea because uh, I mean we're friends with a lot of people who make productivity and creativity
[02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:06.140]  Apps and that's where this is a problem the people making clash of clans and candy crush and all the people who are making the billions
[02:09:06.140 --> 02:09:11.260]  Of dollars on the app store. There's no uncertainty for them. There's no problem with app review for them. They're all fine
[02:09:11.260 --> 02:09:18.380]  Right that never i'm sure it never occurred to the developer to make a version of crossy road that runs as a today view
[02:09:18.380 --> 02:09:21.340]  Widget, yeah, and yeah, and I mean those those are the easy problems
[02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:25.660]  It's the ones that are that are more black and the ones that are more shades of gray that have these problems
[02:09:25.980 --> 02:09:31.100]  And the other argument that it's killing innovation. I mean i've had android devices for four or five years. They have a much easier
[02:09:32.140 --> 02:09:40.300]  Review process than apple does and i've not seen the groundbreaking, you know platform making sort of future apps arrive on android any faster
[02:09:40.300 --> 02:09:44.460]  Because of that than ios and it's easy to say maybe android sucks and that's why it doesn't happen
[02:09:44.460 --> 02:09:48.460]  But it's also possible that apple does add background tasks and they do add
[02:09:48.460 --> 02:09:51.500]  You know extensibility and they they do add the features that they need to add
[02:09:51.500 --> 02:09:56.540]  To give developers sort of the tools that they need to make these sorts of apps and it's possible that things like
[02:09:56.540 --> 02:10:02.540]  Workflow and uber get made regardless of what app review does because you know those things as cool as they are
[02:10:02.540 --> 02:10:06.060]  They don't they don't come across anywhere near the lines that apple draws
[02:10:07.500 --> 02:10:13.100]  Well on the other hand though, I do think to take a devil's advocate position you do we do have
[02:10:13.100 --> 02:10:16.700]  Far more a far richer variety of of
[02:10:17.660 --> 02:10:19.660]  outside the bounds of the
[02:10:20.540 --> 02:10:25.420]  Stock factory os productivity software on mac than we do ios. Yes
[02:10:25.980 --> 02:10:30.140]  the difference is that ios is starting with this foundation of
[02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:38.380]  We apple are promising you that nothing you install from the app store is going to do something like run away in the background
[02:10:38.380 --> 02:10:45.100]  Or, you know be hard to uninstall if you don't like it, you know that you you know
[02:10:45.100 --> 02:10:51.740]  Whereas the the risks you take on the mac of allowing anything and everything that you can download outside the app store
[02:10:52.300 --> 02:10:59.100]  Is that you have utilities that can be hard to uninstall I tried to install uninstall blackberry connect and it was a nightmare
[02:10:59.820 --> 02:11:04.940]  It's you know, it's always and I think it's less of a problem than it used to be but it's always been a problem and that
[02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:08.460]  You might add uncertainty and if you feel like, you know
[02:11:08.460 --> 02:11:13.180]  like a non-technical user like we know that if the fan's running on your computer and you don't think it should be you can
[02:11:13.180 --> 02:11:19.180]  Go to activity monitor or up there to the battery menu and it'll tell you you know in recent versions who's you know
[02:11:19.180 --> 02:11:21.180]  Which app is using excessive power?
[02:11:23.100 --> 02:11:26.780]  You know, but it's it could it can be confusing to a typical user
[02:11:26.780 --> 02:11:31.820]  They don't know to do those things and what if it's some app that they've never heard of because it's you know
[02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:37.420]  The helper app for another app. It's a faceless background app. That doesn't doesn't even show up in their doc
[02:11:38.300 --> 02:11:42.060]  Well, then what do they do? You know ios has this promise of
[02:11:42.700 --> 02:11:48.540]  We're you're never going to have to worry about those things and you know part of that promise it only happens if if
[02:11:48.860 --> 02:11:50.860]  Everything goes through an app store review process
[02:11:51.420 --> 02:11:56.540]  Which is why to install the keyboard you go to download an app and even though that app does absolutely nothing once you've downloaded
[02:11:56.540 --> 02:11:58.700]  It and if you delete it the keyboard goes away
[02:11:58.700 --> 02:12:01.900]  It's still the same mechanism to deliver all the new features that they're adding
[02:12:03.020 --> 02:12:08.940]  It's an interesting problem to solve and I think you know, I use pcalc the widget all the time I I bear sorry James
[02:12:08.940 --> 02:12:14.540]  I barely launch pcalc anymore because a widget is just enough almost all the time and I use drafts and I use transmit
[02:12:14.540 --> 02:12:17.820]  And I love all these features and i'm happy that apple reversed the stuff
[02:12:17.980 --> 02:12:23.980]  I just think that you like it's worth breaking down the process that happens because the more you understand it did drafts get everything back
[02:12:23.980 --> 02:12:25.020]  Yes
[02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:29.980]  Well, I did I wasn't aware of that. I knew that they that they had had some, you know, the same type of issues
[02:12:29.980 --> 02:12:30.860]  Yeah, well, that's good to know
[02:12:30.860 --> 02:12:33.900]  The only thing that was rejected outright was the the app launcher
[02:12:34.300 --> 02:12:39.260]  Because absolutely doesn't believe that other things should launch apps and the guy who tried there was a rule that says you couldn't have keyboards
[02:12:39.260 --> 02:12:43.820]  In widgets, so the guy basically drew his own instead of invoking the built-in one and that was still rejected
[02:12:44.140 --> 02:12:49.340]  Yeah, I think it comes down to my I forgot I was arguing earlier where it's you have to err on one side or the other
[02:12:49.580 --> 02:12:53.100]  And that at least with ios apple's going to be able to do that
[02:12:53.100 --> 02:12:57.100]  at least with ios apple is going to continue to err on this side of
[02:12:59.500 --> 02:13:01.500]  Being a little too strict
[02:13:01.900 --> 02:13:03.500]  and
[02:13:03.500 --> 02:13:08.380]  You know the side effect of that like the benefit of that is that
[02:13:09.260 --> 02:13:10.700]  uh
[02:13:10.700 --> 02:13:14.700]  Abusive software isn't going to is less likely to slip through. Yeah
[02:13:15.180 --> 02:13:20.620]  The downside to it is like you said sometimes it's going to take some ugly airing of
[02:13:20.620 --> 02:13:25.020]  Dirty laundry public airing of dirty laundry to get it to get it sufficiently
[02:13:25.420 --> 02:13:29.660]  You know looked at by a high enough level person and I think I don't want to call it a problem
[02:13:29.660 --> 02:13:35.260]  But I think the sign of the change is that you know, craig federik, he skews more towards geeky than scott forestall
[02:13:35.260 --> 02:13:37.260]  I mean it was hard to get airdrop
[02:13:37.260 --> 02:13:41.500]  Uh on on the iphone and now we have you know extensibility and and continuity
[02:13:41.820 --> 02:13:45.340]  And app store review hasn't changed the way software development has changed, you know
[02:13:45.340 --> 02:13:51.740]  They're they're still very much the organization. They were back in the forest all year and there's going to be some tension
[02:13:52.060 --> 02:13:54.300]  Until that's worked out as we get geekier features. We're gonna
[02:13:54.940 --> 02:13:58.060]  The the iphone was not made for geeks. It was made for app for mainstream people
[02:13:58.060 --> 02:14:01.420]  It was a smartphone that everybody could use but you know geeks loved it as well
[02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:05.180]  And now it's becoming a phone that that works great for geeks because of these features
[02:14:05.420 --> 02:14:08.620]  And I think app app review is going to have to evolve the way the software has
[02:14:09.340 --> 02:14:11.340]  Yeah, totally agree
[02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:13.020]  Um
[02:14:13.020 --> 02:14:16.460]  All right. I think that's our catches up. I think that's our year in review. Good year
[02:14:17.180 --> 02:14:18.700]  Yeah, it was
[02:14:18.700 --> 02:14:25.180]  Uh excited about next year. Oh, i'm I can't wait everything from the apple watch to the theoretically larger ipad to the new features
[02:14:25.260 --> 02:14:30.460]  We'll see with it. I'm an ios 9. I it's I think it's gonna be a great year. I think it's good
[02:14:30.540 --> 02:14:31.420]  I think
[02:14:31.420 --> 02:14:34.140]  One thing is for sure. I think one thing when we if we look back
[02:14:34.860 --> 02:14:36.860]  A year from now in 2015. I think
[02:14:37.180 --> 02:14:41.180]  The first half of 2015 is going to be a lot more interesting than the first half of 2014
[02:14:41.180 --> 02:14:45.020]  Yeah, it's going to harken back. I think to the first year. I wouldn't be surprised if the first year
[02:14:45.580 --> 02:14:48.700]  The first part of 2015 is very similar to the first part of 2010
[02:14:48.780 --> 02:14:53.580]  And the i watch is similar to the launch of the original ipad. Yeah, I do because I have you know
[02:14:54.300 --> 02:14:58.300]  Just off the top of my head. I expect both the bigger ipad and the watch in the first half
[02:14:58.620 --> 02:15:03.980]  Yeah, maybe whether they come at the same event or not. I don't know but you know, I think they're both coming sort of
[02:15:05.260 --> 02:15:08.060]  I just don't know if the apple tv will come with them or if that's still in the garage
[02:15:08.060 --> 02:15:14.960]  You know, honestly no idea wouldn't be surprised. It would be huge if they did all three in the first half. That'd be almost unprecedented
[02:15:15.820 --> 02:15:16.780]  and
[02:15:16.780 --> 02:15:18.220]  it just
[02:15:18.220 --> 02:15:22.380]  As i'm not to try to you know air on the side of getting too excited
[02:15:22.540 --> 02:15:26.880]  But it would kind of make sense in the context of tim cook's previous
[02:15:27.980 --> 02:15:29.980]  you know
[02:15:29.980 --> 02:15:35.820]  Maybe over promising of what they were going to deliver in 2014 that some of these things, you know, maybe got bumped, you know
[02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:37.420]  you know apple pay and
[02:15:39.420 --> 02:15:44.460]  Apple watch count as the plural new product categories
[02:15:46.620 --> 02:15:52.860]  But it does seem like when he first started talking about that I expected a little bit more like maybe one more thing for 2014
[02:15:53.100 --> 02:15:56.460]  Yeah, well, I think I don't know if you heard the same thing I did but the apple tv sounded like last spring and then
[02:15:56.460 --> 02:16:01.100]  It sounded like this fall and then it sounds like next spring and it sounds like that's that's a bigger job than people thought
[02:16:01.100 --> 02:16:03.100]  It was originally going to be
[02:16:03.100 --> 02:16:07.820]  Yeah, I definitely heard back at june and wwdc that it it was
[02:16:09.500 --> 02:16:14.540]  Maybe originally thought that it would come out before the end of 2014 but even back at june it was no way
[02:16:14.540 --> 02:16:19.740]  It's not even not even feasible for it to be a 2014 thing and good i'm happy if they I mean
[02:16:19.740 --> 02:16:24.140]  I I liked it when apple had products spread across the year. I find everything coming in fall just quite a lot to deal with
[02:16:24.860 --> 02:16:29.740]  Yeah, well and the other thing too that I think made it impossible and it's not even to get in any details of it
[02:16:29.740 --> 02:16:34.620]  It's not even to get in any details of it, but it's just the simple fact that if it doesn't ship by october
[02:16:34.700 --> 02:16:40.780]  It doesn't ship that year. Yes that november and december don't count because they can they're just too late for the holiday season
[02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:47.440]  Absolutely that if it can't be announced in october, it doesn't get announced till 2015 and it doesn't get announced 2015
[02:16:47.980 --> 02:16:52.620]  It's probably like more like february than january. Yeah, and we we'd start to see signs already
[02:16:52.620 --> 02:16:55.980]  I mean if any of those products were like january february we'd start seeing things moving
[02:16:55.980 --> 02:17:02.540]  Yeah, like november december january. Not that apple doesn't get work done, but products don't get slated for release in those months
[02:17:03.420 --> 02:17:08.940]  All right renee more people can find out more see your great work at i'more. Of course i'more.com
[02:17:09.740 --> 02:17:13.420]  What are your podcasts list your podcasts? I have debug with guy english
[02:17:13.420 --> 02:17:18.940]  We talk to developers about developing stuff and then I have vector with guy english dave whiskus and georgia dow
[02:17:18.940 --> 02:17:24.700]  We talk about the intersection of technology and humanity and I do iterate with mark edwards and seth clifford, which is designer oriented stuff
[02:17:24.700 --> 02:17:29.340]  Who do you think is going to record more podcast episodes in 2015 you or jason snow?
[02:17:30.140 --> 02:17:35.820]  I I it's it's neck and neck but I love that or maybe mike hurley. I mean it's it's becoming a it's becoming a bit of a
[02:17:36.380 --> 02:17:38.380]  of a joke, I guess
[02:17:40.140 --> 02:17:46.780]  They're all good shows you're prolific I like here's why I like having you on this show because I feel like on your regular shows
[02:17:47.100 --> 02:17:52.780]  You defer to your guests and sometimes I forget that you're you're even there. I'm like, where'd renee go?
[02:17:52.780 --> 02:17:55.820]  I'd like to hear renee piping. You are so deferential
[02:17:55.820 --> 02:18:01.660]  I like having you here and letting you go off because man, you really know your shit. Thank you. I really appreciate that
[02:18:02.220 --> 02:18:03.580]  All right
