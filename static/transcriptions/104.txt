[00:00.000 --> 00:01.000]  So where to start?
[00:01.000 --> 00:03.000]  I say, let's talk about Renee Ritchie.
[00:03.000 --> 00:04.520]  Let's talk, you're in review.
[00:04.520 --> 00:05.520]  Yes.
[00:05.520 --> 00:08.480]  Where better to start than January?
[00:08.480 --> 00:10.320]  It was a quiet beginning of the year.
[00:10.320 --> 00:11.960]  It was so quiet that people were, again,
[00:11.960 --> 00:13.360]  pounding the doom drums set up.
[00:13.360 --> 00:15.360]  It wasn't doing anything anymore.
[00:15.360 --> 00:16.120]  Yeah.
[00:16.120 --> 00:18.240]  And maybe even before we get into details,
[00:18.240 --> 00:22.280]  like January, maybe just take that and use it.
[00:22.280 --> 00:24.360]  Like to me, like the year in review as a whole,
[00:24.360 --> 00:26.520]  like with zoom out, big level,
[00:26.520 --> 00:29.120]  what are we going to look back on this year?
[00:29.120 --> 00:35.000]  I would say that this was the year where that sense,
[00:35.000 --> 00:38.640]  that Apple can't do it anymore since got rubbed away
[00:38.640 --> 00:41.520]  slowly but surely over the course of the year.
[00:41.520 --> 00:41.880]  I agree.
[00:41.880 --> 00:42.800]  I think it built up too.
[00:42.800 --> 00:45.200]  I think it reached a crescendo because people
[00:45.200 --> 00:46.840]  kept making a big deal of Tim Cook saying
[00:46.840 --> 00:50.360]  we'd be releasing new product categories throughout the year.
[00:50.360 --> 00:51.760]  And then as a month's ticked on,
[00:51.760 --> 00:55.920]  they seem to get more and more personally angry with him.
[00:55.920 --> 00:57.000]  Yeah, I think so too.
[00:57.000 --> 01:00.880]  And I think because the naysayers
[01:00.880 --> 01:04.640]  have been down on Cook overall anyway.
[01:04.640 --> 01:07.400]  Like that's the root of their naysaying.
[01:07.400 --> 01:09.480]  Yeah, I mean, we go over the short term,
[01:09.480 --> 01:10.840]  at least they wanted him fired.
[01:10.840 --> 01:12.440]  They said he was destroying Apple.
[01:12.440 --> 01:15.840]  They kept comparing him to Steve Jobs in a very negative way.
[01:15.840 --> 01:19.120]  And looking back at an eyesight, it's absolutely ridiculous.
[01:19.120 --> 01:22.360]  Yeah, I was just thinking that before we started recording,
[01:22.360 --> 01:26.080]  I was thinking that I don't think anybody called for that in 2014,
[01:26.080 --> 01:29.520]  but at least in 2013, you can find several instances
[01:29.520 --> 01:33.520]  of ostensibly serious business writers
[01:33.520 --> 01:36.240]  calling either for Tim Cook to be outright fired,
[01:36.240 --> 01:39.680]  or at least calling for Apple's board to like
[01:39.680 --> 01:43.040]  reign him in and have him rejigger the company.
[01:43.040 --> 01:45.280]  But we did have Haunted Empire, I think, earlier this year,
[01:45.280 --> 01:47.440]  which sort of showed that Apple was completely
[01:47.440 --> 01:48.920]  doomed without Steve Jobs.
[01:48.920 --> 01:55.320]  Yeah, I think that's sort of the publication of Haunted Empire.
[01:55.320 --> 01:56.880]  What was her first name?
[01:56.880 --> 01:58.440]  Her last name is Kane, or?
[01:58.440 --> 01:59.960]  Yeah, you could, you could Torrey.
[01:59.960 --> 02:01.040]  Yeah, you could Torrey.
[02:01.040 --> 02:06.440]  Kane, I would say that the publication of her book, Haunted Empire,
[02:06.440 --> 02:08.800]  was sort of the, I was going to say, high watermark,
[02:08.800 --> 02:13.160]  but I would say maybe the low watermark of Apple naysaying.
[02:13.160 --> 02:15.800]  Yeah, when did that come out?
[02:15.800 --> 02:17.600]  That was probably February.
[02:17.600 --> 02:20.240]  Yeah, it was when I was with Jason Snell,
[02:20.240 --> 02:22.640]  which means that it had to be around Macworld time or something.
[02:22.640 --> 02:24.800]  Yeah, which was, I think, February.
[02:24.800 --> 02:27.840]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:27.840 --> 02:31.360]  Yeah, and I could not help but get the feeling when I read it,
[02:31.360 --> 02:36.960]  that it was rushed into publication, because I kind of felt like, at least,
[02:36.960 --> 02:42.320]  if she didn't know, at least her, the editorial team at her publisher sort
[02:42.320 --> 02:47.360]  of got the sense that the time was kicking on that sort of doom and gloom.
[02:47.360 --> 02:51.680]  Which was interesting, because you could probably make an argument for a haunted
[02:51.680 --> 02:55.120]  empire, but they didn't even make an attempt to make it. It was a bunch of pages
[02:55.120 --> 02:57.760]  strung together and nothing resembling a book.
[02:57.760 --> 03:01.000]  Yeah, and a bunch of a couple of anecdotes to string it together.
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.680]  Yeah, I do think, though, like, if there is, I think it was a very bad book.
[03:05.680 --> 03:08.240]  And I think it's already showing its age.
[03:08.240 --> 03:11.880]  And I think it's only going to look worse as the years go on.
[03:11.880 --> 03:16.200]  But on the other hand, I kind of glad the book exists,
[03:16.200 --> 03:25.800]  because it captures that sort of post-Steve jobs, pre-apple watch,
[03:25.800 --> 03:28.280]  negative, Apple perspective.
[03:28.280 --> 03:29.920]  Like an in hindsight, you know what I mean?
[03:29.920 --> 03:32.200]  It's like these years, they always blur together.
[03:32.200 --> 03:38.120]  And four or five years from now, it's like this whole period in between
[03:38.120 --> 03:39.640]  where the Apple watch was announced.
[03:39.640 --> 03:43.800]  And when we actually have it and we have Generation 2 and 3 by, you know,
[03:43.800 --> 03:48.600]  four or five years from now, it'll just, you know, be a blink, you know,
[03:48.600 --> 03:51.200]  we'll snap our fingers and think about these, this interim period.
[03:51.200 --> 03:55.000]  But I feel like her book sort of captures the epitomizes that,
[03:55.000 --> 03:56.920]  that sort of negative viewpoint.
[03:56.920 --> 03:58.280]  Yeah, I think that's absolutely true.
[03:58.280 --> 04:01.160]  We do tend to look back sort of rose-colored glass of the original iPhone,
[04:01.160 --> 04:02.000]  the original iPad.
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.000]  They couldn't do anywhere nearly what they could do now,
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.000]  but we still look at them with fondness.
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.840]  We think of current software updates as being buggy,
[04:08.840 --> 04:11.920]  but you look back at iOS, you know, two points something when everyone
[04:11.920 --> 04:15.760]  was playing a couldn't attach to a 3G network and Apple was rushing out of fix.
[04:15.760 --> 04:18.800]  We have this weird sort of affection, I think, for the past.
[04:18.800 --> 04:19.840]  Yeah.
[04:19.840 --> 04:24.360]  So I do, I think that's 2014 in a nutshell,
[04:24.360 --> 04:29.560]  is that the world at large and the conventional wisdom about Apple and
[04:29.560 --> 04:32.480]  about Tim Cook's leadership have caught up to reality,
[04:32.480 --> 04:37.560]  which is that the company was, you know, Steve Jobs left the company
[04:37.560 --> 04:40.480]  in very good shape and in very good hands.
[04:40.480 --> 04:41.800]  Yes.
[04:41.800 --> 04:44.920]  And it took about two or three years,
[04:44.920 --> 04:48.520]  it seems, for the mainstream financial media sort of concede that point.
[04:48.520 --> 04:50.960]  I would say that almost a full three years, right?
[04:50.960 --> 04:52.880]  Because he died in 2011.
[04:52.880 --> 04:53.720]  Yes.
[04:53.720 --> 04:55.680]  I would say it was a full three years.
[04:55.680 --> 04:58.840]  And Tim Cook, I mean, the company has never been worth more of the stock prices
[04:58.840 --> 04:59.360]  through the roof.
[04:59.360 --> 05:02.240]  They've introduced not only the Apple Watch, but Apple Pay.
[05:02.240 --> 05:03.800]  They have an AX processor.
[05:03.800 --> 05:05.520]  They have a 5K iMac.
[05:05.520 --> 05:08.200]  And you still look at Fortune contributor networks sometimes.
[05:08.200 --> 05:11.320]  And you just want to know how they get published.
[05:11.320 --> 05:12.760]  Yeah.
[05:12.760 --> 05:13.120]  All right.
[05:13.120 --> 05:15.800]  You're in review January.
[05:15.800 --> 05:18.080]  Definitely a slow start, I think.
[05:18.080 --> 05:18.400]  Yeah.
[05:18.400 --> 05:22.160]  Again, for some years, I mean, one year we got the Verizon iPhone in January.
[05:22.160 --> 05:23.960]  One year we got an education event.
[05:23.960 --> 05:26.680]  Previous years we had the introduction of the iPad.
[05:26.680 --> 05:28.680]  We've had Mac world, the introduction of the iPhone.
[05:28.680 --> 05:31.760]  So there was sort of, for a long period of time, there were events that were,
[05:31.760 --> 05:33.640]  there was news in January.
[05:33.640 --> 05:36.600]  And I think last year, there was nothing until WEC.
[05:36.600 --> 05:40.240]  And this year, I think it was almost identical to that.
[05:40.240 --> 05:43.400]  Yeah, I would say so.
[05:43.400 --> 05:48.640]  I mean, there's, you know, now that Apple doesn't make announcements in January, or at
[05:48.640 --> 05:53.840]  least they haven't in recent years, I mean, who knows this year in theory, they might
[05:53.840 --> 06:00.280]  have a watch event, but it's pretty much left to CES, which Apple doesn't take part
[06:00.280 --> 06:03.800]  in for all of the industry news.
[06:03.800 --> 06:12.520]  I don't recall anything from this year, to 2014 CES that ended up mattering a damn bit.
[06:12.520 --> 06:16.080]  No, I mean, I think this year will be different just because of home kit and health kit
[06:16.080 --> 06:19.200]  and car play, but last year, CES was a graveyard.
[06:19.200 --> 06:24.040]  It was just almost like matrix shelf after a matrix shelf of cases and nothing else.
[06:24.040 --> 06:28.480]  Yeah, and I don't think they knew what they were going to, you know, going to the industry
[06:28.480 --> 06:31.560]  as a whole didn't even know what they were trying to make.
[06:31.560 --> 06:33.120]  Yeah, they were making their fitness bands.
[06:33.120 --> 06:38.000]  And I remember one of the worst things I saw at CES was an Android powered car system and
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.640]  it was running gingerbread and the guy told us with a straight face that you could leave
[06:41.640 --> 06:44.400]  it on for five days, but it would drain your car battery.
[06:44.400 --> 06:47.920]  So you had to put it in standby mode, but if you put it, sorry, but if you turned it off,
[06:47.920 --> 06:51.480]  it would take like five minutes to boot again.
[06:51.480 --> 06:55.720]  This was something that they actually had as a press event.
[06:55.720 --> 06:57.280]  Are you going to CES again this year?
[06:57.280 --> 06:58.280]  Yeah, absolutely.
[06:58.280 --> 07:02.200]  Yeah, what's Dan Fromer who was on the show last week is going for the first time this
[07:02.200 --> 07:03.200]  year.
[07:03.200 --> 07:07.880]  Uh, and like I said with him, I always talk about going, but I've never gone, but it's
[07:07.880 --> 07:11.480]  alternatively completely barren or incredibly busy and you never know what's going to happen
[07:11.480 --> 07:14.200]  year to year.
[07:14.200 --> 07:16.840]  So I don't have high faith for it, but I think it, I think this year will be different
[07:16.840 --> 07:18.040]  because we will have a watch event.
[07:18.040 --> 07:19.440]  Maybe we'll see another Apple television.
[07:19.440 --> 07:20.440]  Maybe a bigger iPad.
[07:20.440 --> 07:24.920]  The spring sounds exciting this year, but last year up until, until June, it really was
[07:24.920 --> 07:27.760]  everyone just saying, whereas the new stuff from Apple, whereas the new stuff are the
[07:27.760 --> 07:29.320]  capable of innovating still.
[07:29.320 --> 07:30.320]  Yeah.
[07:30.320 --> 07:31.320]  Why we have to wait.
[07:31.320 --> 07:33.320]  Why do we have to wait for them to be ready with something?
[07:33.320 --> 07:37.360]  Well, that's the thing that I don't understand is do like would anybody have wanted a 2006
[07:37.360 --> 07:38.360]  iPhone?
[07:38.360 --> 07:40.200]  No, because it was not a product yet.
[07:40.200 --> 07:43.280]  And the Apple watch won't be a product until early next year.
[07:43.280 --> 07:46.120]  You don't want them to ship what they have right now.
[07:46.120 --> 07:47.120]  Yeah.
[07:47.120 --> 07:52.520]  And it, you know, to compare and contrast with I think the antithesis of Apple's, you
[07:52.520 --> 07:56.960]  know, we'll let you know when we're ready to show you attitude is Google, you know,
[07:56.960 --> 08:03.040]  who has been, you know, Google Glass was clearly released ahead of its time.
[08:03.040 --> 08:06.720]  I mean, it's still not, it still isn't a retail consumer product, but the fact that they
[08:06.720 --> 08:10.000]  sold it at all to what did they call the people explorers?
[08:10.000 --> 08:11.000]  Yes.
[08:11.000 --> 08:14.720]  You know, is the antithesis of Apple strategy.
[08:14.720 --> 08:21.480]  That would be the equivalent of a Apple head let WWDC explorers start wearing and using
[08:21.480 --> 08:24.400]  an Apple watch, you know, 18 months ago.
[08:24.400 --> 08:27.920]  Being like skank watch software or something.
[08:27.920 --> 08:28.920]  Right.
[08:28.920 --> 08:36.520]  You know, the self-driving cars, so many things that Google does, they show way early.
[08:36.520 --> 08:41.480]  And in some sense, I don't think it's productive.
[08:41.480 --> 08:45.360]  And you know, every time I bring it up, some people mention that the car is in particular,
[08:45.360 --> 08:51.760]  it's impossible to do it without showing your hand because there's no way to road test them.
[08:51.760 --> 08:54.560]  You know, you have to road test them in a public before you can release them and you
[08:54.560 --> 08:57.000]  know, way to keep once it's out in a road, you can't keep it secret.
[08:57.000 --> 09:05.600]  So maybe the self-driving cars is a bit of a bad example, but, you know, the other products
[09:05.600 --> 09:06.920]  they do, they release.
[09:06.920 --> 09:13.400]  And I think it, I think ultimately it's counterproductive because I think it saps away excitement
[09:13.400 --> 09:17.880]  from the real things you actually have available to sell to people.
[09:17.880 --> 09:26.280]  But on the other hand, it absolutely works to satisfy the desires of the tech press as an
[09:26.280 --> 09:29.800]  industry because they, you're giving them something to write about.
[09:29.800 --> 09:30.800]  Yeah.
[09:30.800 --> 09:34.440]  I think that's exactly, I think for the tech press, perception really is reality.
[09:34.440 --> 09:39.840]  So if we see a demo of the Moto 240 or 360 or whatever it is, even though it's not real,
[09:39.840 --> 09:43.400]  even though leaving a screen like that on like what they showed in the video is a complete
[09:43.400 --> 09:46.560]  science fiction fantasy, it sets expectations for that.
[09:46.560 --> 09:49.600]  And it makes people think that Google's really busy in that product is coming and they're
[09:49.600 --> 09:51.640]  innovating and they're doing all these things.
[09:51.640 --> 09:55.480]  And if it comes out, in some cases, you know, it's a complete turd, but everyone's already
[09:55.480 --> 09:56.480]  seen the video.
[09:56.480 --> 09:59.560]  The excitement's already happened and then everything else from then on, is it his appointment
[09:59.560 --> 10:02.360]  even things made by Apple or another company?
[10:02.360 --> 10:07.840]  Yeah, it's, I think mulch has said it best where he's, you know, I think it's mulch.
[10:07.840 --> 10:13.600]  But one of his lines is that, you know, Apple's current products continue to fail when
[10:13.600 --> 10:18.120]  compared to the upcoming products in future years from its competitors.
[10:18.120 --> 10:22.440]  It's like the iPhone 5C was a huge disappointment, even though it was the third most popular
[10:22.440 --> 10:26.680]  phone in the world and the iPad sales are lagging, even though there any company in the
[10:26.680 --> 10:29.120]  world would be happy to have that in their product line.
[10:29.120 --> 10:33.280]  Yeah, or another example I just noticed this week and it's funny, I haven't linked it up yet,
[10:33.280 --> 10:41.040]  but the same day or within 24 hours, there was a New York Times story about the success
[10:41.040 --> 10:48.080]  of Apple Pay and about a whole bunch of nude retailers who've signed up for it.
[10:48.080 --> 10:53.720]  Some big supermarket chains like Windixie, which is real big in the South here in the U.S.
[10:53.720 --> 10:58.880]  I forget who else, but some big, big name retailers have signed up.
[10:58.880 --> 11:02.880]  And companies like Whole Foods who've been on board since it started who've said that
[11:02.880 --> 11:07.600]  it's, you know, it accounts for over 1% of their transactions and an enormous percent of,
[11:07.600 --> 11:13.880]  you know, the digital transactions or what would you call it, cardless transactions.
[11:13.880 --> 11:18.040]  And at the same time, there were like three or four stories that I saw all based on the
[11:18.040 --> 11:24.640]  same analyst report about what, what, what trouble Apple Pay is in because they've woken
[11:24.640 --> 11:31.320]  up the MCX partners and really gotten the MCX partners to really want to do a good job.
[11:31.320 --> 11:35.920]  And so now Apple Pay is in trouble because MCX is, is still coming.
[11:35.920 --> 11:40.200]  It reminds me that article I think it was two weeks ago where someone said Apple Pay,
[11:40.200 --> 11:43.920]  I would probably another one of the Forbes contributor networks, that Apple Pay was a huge
[11:43.920 --> 11:49.240]  disappointment because it was only responsible for a very small amount of transactions worldwide.
[11:49.240 --> 11:52.720]  Nevermind America didn't have a much of equipment for it and it was only available in America,
[11:52.720 --> 11:55.600]  which, which, you know, far behind in terms of NFC.
[11:55.600 --> 11:58.320]  It's amazing what perspective they can bring to it when they try hard enough to put it
[11:58.320 --> 11:59.320]  in a bad light.
[11:59.320 --> 12:00.320]  Right.
[12:00.320 --> 12:05.920]  That there's no other digital, you know, pay with your phone transaction, retail thing
[12:05.920 --> 12:10.520]  that's even close to as popular as Apple Pay, but somehow it's a failure because it's
[12:10.520 --> 12:16.120]  still only 1% of the market, you know, two months in, yeah, in one country, or not even
[12:16.120 --> 12:17.120]  two months, right?
[12:17.120 --> 12:19.920]  It didn't even launch until November, I think, right?
[12:19.920 --> 12:24.520]  October, I think came with iOS 8.1, all right, well, still that's, you know, right about
[12:24.520 --> 12:29.760]  two months, two months.
[12:29.760 --> 12:40.040]  And it's crazy to me too that with the MCX that they don't mention the people who want
[12:40.040 --> 12:43.200]  to promote it, which I think, I think it's not because they actually believe it.
[12:43.200 --> 12:47.720]  I think it's even though they're analysts rather than press, I think it's this idea
[12:47.720 --> 12:54.720]  that you want to present everything as a neck and neck battle, right?
[12:54.720 --> 12:58.920]  You know, and so Apple Pay is threatened by MCX because it's going to be backed by Walmart
[12:58.920 --> 13:05.160]  and whoever else and they have, you know, huge, huge footprint in retail.
[13:05.160 --> 13:13.280]  But they just skip over the most obvious aspects of what has made Apple Pay successful,
[13:13.280 --> 13:20.760]  which is exactly what Tim Cook said on stage when he introduced it, which is, you know,
[13:20.760 --> 13:26.600]  it's one of my biggest recurring mantras about Apple is don't underestimate how often they're
[13:26.600 --> 13:29.240]  not giving you any spin, any bullshit.
[13:29.240 --> 13:34.240]  They're just telling you flat out in plain language exactly why they did what they did.
[13:34.240 --> 13:39.040]  And with Apple Pay, Tim Cook's explanation was, we think everybody else who's tried this
[13:39.040 --> 13:43.480]  to date has failed because they haven't concentrated on the user experience and made that
[13:43.480 --> 13:44.800]  their priority.
[13:44.800 --> 13:46.160]  That's what we've done.
[13:46.160 --> 13:53.160]  We've made it as easy as possible to use, as quick to use and as privacy protecting as
[13:53.160 --> 14:00.680]  we can, all in the name of the user, you know, and if that's all they did, well, then
[14:00.680 --> 14:04.400]  who, you know, what retailer would hook up the equipment, but the other things they did
[14:04.400 --> 14:12.600]  secondary to the user focus is use the established infrastructure for NFC payments and make
[14:12.600 --> 14:22.160]  the banks happy by taking a very minimal cut and by promising significantly increased security,
[14:22.160 --> 14:25.000]  which gets the banks on board because the banks can do the math.
[14:25.000 --> 14:32.600]  And I really do think it works out, which is that Apple's little 0.15% cut of the transactions
[14:32.600 --> 14:37.880]  is less than the cost of fraud per transaction that the banks have been used to.
[14:37.880 --> 14:41.640]  I think that's absolutely a trick, especially when you look at, and the privacy in the security
[14:41.640 --> 14:45.480]  too, when you look at all the data breaches at the targets or the Home Depot's, but I think
[14:45.480 --> 14:48.040]  you nailed it when you said it, it's aligned with my interest.
[14:48.040 --> 14:51.680]  I've gone to Apple Pay terminals, you know, even the demo one set up at Apple when we're
[14:51.680 --> 14:55.120]  at the event, and they read my Canadian NFC credit card.
[14:55.120 --> 14:58.040]  That technology is not going to just benefit Apple, it's going to benefit everybody who
[14:58.040 --> 15:03.240]  uses any sort of NFC transaction, and you compare that to current currency or whatever
[15:03.240 --> 15:07.200]  it's called, and that you have to give the retailer your bank account, you have to have
[15:07.200 --> 15:09.600]  a QR code, you have to scan the QR code.
[15:09.600 --> 15:13.400]  And it is such a horrible experience, and it's not done to the benefit of the consumer,
[15:13.400 --> 15:17.280]  it's done to try to increase the amount of, to save money on transactions that they
[15:17.280 --> 15:20.520]  pay the credit card companies, never mind how long it's going to, how much money is going
[15:20.520 --> 15:24.520]  to cost them in terms of cashier's fees for the incredibly complicated error prone system
[15:24.520 --> 15:25.480]  that they're establishing.
[15:25.480 --> 15:26.480]  Right.
[15:26.480 --> 15:31.980]  You can't prove yet that Tim Cook's explanation for, you know, why they thought Apple
[15:31.980 --> 15:38.800]  Pay would be successful and why it seems to be successful to date are true and that a user
[15:38.800 --> 15:42.560]  focused approach is the way to get it done.
[15:42.560 --> 15:48.480]  And who knows, maybe something like current C will also become popular.
[15:48.480 --> 15:54.040]  I don't know, I have my doubts about currency in particular, but it could be that something
[15:54.040 --> 15:59.160]  that's a lot more retailer friendly as opposed to consumer friendly could work.
[15:59.160 --> 16:04.600]  But the evidence to date suggests, you know, that what Apple said was exactly right.
[16:04.600 --> 16:10.560]  It's also, what benefits the retailer is interesting because me getting through the check
[16:10.560 --> 16:12.800]  out line really quickly benefits the retailer.
[16:12.800 --> 16:16.600]  And I believe it's my understanding that a lot of, they signed multi-year agreements with
[16:16.600 --> 16:20.720]  currency and with MCX when they started, which was a silly thing to do, but they did
[16:20.720 --> 16:24.440]  it, but I believe a lot of those expire pretty early on this year and it'll be interesting
[16:24.440 --> 16:28.040]  for not this year, but in 2015 and it'll be interesting to see how many of those adopt
[16:28.040 --> 16:33.160]  Apple Pay as soon as they are contractually allowed to.
[16:33.160 --> 16:37.360]  And the other thing that I keep thinking about as a technical limitation is the way that
[16:37.360 --> 16:42.640]  there's one thing that Apple Pay has that no other payment system that would work on the
[16:42.640 --> 16:44.080]  iPhone at least.
[16:44.080 --> 16:47.760]  I mean, obviously like what Google could enable on Android or Microsoft with Windows
[16:47.760 --> 16:52.480]  Phone is different, but at least if you want iPhone using customers, the one thing they
[16:52.480 --> 16:58.680]  have that nobody else can do is the way that it works at the system level rather than
[16:58.680 --> 17:00.080]  the app level.
[17:00.080 --> 17:03.720]  And I just can't emphasize enough for anybody out there who hasn't used Apple Pay yet
[17:03.720 --> 17:09.120]  because you don't have a iPhone 6 or because you don't shop at one of the places that
[17:09.120 --> 17:10.520]  supports it yet.
[17:10.520 --> 17:17.440]  But I just can't emphasize enough how, how, how, instead of like feeling like a one step
[17:17.440 --> 17:22.280]  process, it almost feels like a zero step process because you don't have to unlock your
[17:22.280 --> 17:23.280]  phone.
[17:23.280 --> 17:27.480]  You just take the phone, even if it's not on and just get it within an inch of that
[17:27.480 --> 17:33.520]  terminal, put your rest, your thumb on the, on the reader and it's, that's it.
[17:33.520 --> 17:35.960]  It's, it's not like nobody else can do that.
[17:35.960 --> 17:41.160]  Like you, if a current C app on the iPhone, you would have to unlock your phone, open
[17:41.160 --> 17:48.680]  the app and go from there, which is, you know, it doesn't sound like a lot, but compared
[17:48.680 --> 17:50.840]  to Apple Pay, it is a lot.
[17:50.840 --> 17:51.840]  I get upset.
[17:51.840 --> 17:54.920]  Most places here, I can just tap my card and go and when it doesn't work, you feel like
[17:54.920 --> 17:58.360]  an animal having to, you know, put it in and put it in a pin goater or swipe it in.
[17:58.360 --> 18:02.720]  I haven't had to swipe or sign something in the, you know, over a year, but it reminds me
[18:02.720 --> 18:04.320]  of something else and it's a bit of a tangent.
[18:04.320 --> 18:06.280]  But I think, I think it's the same thing.
[18:06.280 --> 18:11.040]  It's, it's, it all goes back to Apple making like the A8 chipset or the 8X chipset in
[18:11.040 --> 18:12.600]  that you take the cameras for instance.
[18:12.600 --> 18:16.040]  I take out my iPhone, I can just take a picture and on nine out of 10 times, it's going
[18:16.040 --> 18:19.240]  to be a perfect, a really good everyday picture.
[18:19.240 --> 18:22.120]  And that's because Apple makes their own image signal processor.
[18:22.120 --> 18:25.880]  When you look at Microsoft, who buys off the shelf chips, they have to put really big
[18:25.880 --> 18:29.360]  glass on the front and collect as much light as they can because they're using, they're
[18:29.360 --> 18:30.920]  using off the shelf chips.
[18:30.920 --> 18:32.480]  There's no advantage to them there.
[18:32.480 --> 18:35.200]  Apple has no idea what hardware or what software is running on their phones.
[18:35.200 --> 18:38.040]  They try to suck it up to the server and do all the auto awesome stuff.
[18:38.040 --> 18:41.360]  But Apple is just making sure that they have a good camera on it.
[18:41.360 --> 18:45.560]  They'll process it in almost any shot you take will be useful for a normal person.
[18:45.560 --> 18:47.000]  And this, that's the same thing.
[18:47.000 --> 18:50.600]  You can't get that advantage unless you own the entire stack the way that they do.
[18:50.600 --> 18:53.240]  And now they're moving that into payments and then moving that into other areas with
[18:53.240 --> 18:54.240]  the iPhone.
[18:54.240 --> 18:55.240]  Yeah.
[18:55.240 --> 18:57.920]  No, you can't underestimate the, the, the advantage that they are.
[18:57.920 --> 19:03.360]  And I think it totally gets written off by these naysaying analysts.
[19:03.360 --> 19:07.720]  What an advantage Apple has by controlling that level of, of the stack.
[19:07.720 --> 19:10.960]  I used to think they were naysaying and I have, I have a friend who was a sell site analyst
[19:10.960 --> 19:11.960]  and he explained it to me.
[19:11.960 --> 19:15.960]  And it's that the press reports analyst as though they're giving comments to readers.
[19:15.960 --> 19:17.520]  And their comments are not meant for their readers.
[19:17.520 --> 19:19.320]  They're meant to manipulate the markets.
[19:19.320 --> 19:22.920]  And what they say is very little to do with what they believe it, it's entirely, they
[19:22.920 --> 19:26.400]  probably told their own client something different two days ago or three days ago.
[19:26.400 --> 19:28.280]  Now they want to produce results for them.
[19:28.280 --> 19:29.280]  So it's so undependable.
[19:29.280 --> 19:31.040]  I don't know why it gets reported.
[19:31.040 --> 19:32.040]  Right.
[19:32.040 --> 19:36.320]  Like an analyst who comes out with a report that seems to be very pessimistic about Apple
[19:36.320 --> 19:41.720]  pays long term prospects might in fact, honestly, privately in terms of where he's putting
[19:41.720 --> 19:45.760]  money and advising his clients to put money being very bullish on the future of Apple
[19:45.760 --> 19:46.760]  pay.
[19:46.760 --> 19:49.160]  It's like that video with Crane from a couple of years ago where he says, you want to make
[19:49.160 --> 19:50.160]  money.
[19:50.160 --> 19:52.000]  You, you spent a rumor saying the iPhone is going to be delayed.
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.440]  You call up and use networks and you tell them it's going to be delayed.
[19:54.440 --> 19:57.440]  And all of a sudden Apple's down and you've shorted all the shares and I think that happens
[19:57.440 --> 19:58.440]  a lot.
[19:58.440 --> 19:59.440]  Yeah.
[19:59.440 --> 20:00.440]  What was that guy's name?
[20:00.440 --> 20:01.440]  Jim Kramer.
[20:01.440 --> 20:02.440]  Yeah.
[20:02.440 --> 20:03.440]  Jim Kramer.
[20:03.440 --> 20:04.440]  That's it.
[20:04.440 --> 20:05.440]  It's baffling.
[20:05.440 --> 20:07.600]  And again, this stuff keeps getting reported as though it's factual accounting on what Apple's
[20:07.600 --> 20:11.400]  doing.
[20:11.400 --> 20:14.440]  What else in the first half of the year?
[20:14.440 --> 20:18.640]  I think there was, I think Angela Aaron's was in early on in the year.
[20:18.640 --> 20:19.640]  Yeah.
[20:19.640 --> 20:20.640]  I do think so.
[20:20.640 --> 20:21.640]  When was she?
[20:21.640 --> 20:22.640]  She was there.
[20:22.640 --> 20:24.640]  February, March.
[20:24.640 --> 20:25.640]  Yeah.
[20:25.640 --> 20:28.080]  Complete turnaround from John Browitt in the previous year.
[20:28.080 --> 20:29.080]  Yeah.
[20:29.080 --> 20:32.760]  And I think that's super interesting because Apple is really doing well in Apple stores.
[20:32.760 --> 20:35.560]  But some people, some people will say that it's a stale experience that they haven't
[20:35.560 --> 20:36.560]  evolved it.
[20:36.560 --> 20:40.600]  Even though it's working, it's hugely successful, but they gave her not only Apple retail
[20:40.600 --> 20:44.600]  but Apple online as well, which used to operate almost as separate businesses.
[20:44.600 --> 20:49.680]  And it's similar to giving Federiki control over both OS 10 and iOS and that those, those
[20:49.680 --> 20:53.920]  sort of artificial walls are falling down and it's providing better service for everybody
[20:53.920 --> 20:54.920]  involved.
[20:54.920 --> 21:03.760]  So Angela, her hiring was announced a year ago in October 2013, but she did not start until,
[21:03.760 --> 21:07.400]  I believe February or March of 2014.
[21:07.400 --> 21:12.320]  I've said this before, and it seems obvious, but it's so clear to me that the reason
[21:12.320 --> 21:17.280]  why they hired her and why she would take the job is because of the watch.
[21:17.280 --> 21:18.280]  Yes.
[21:18.280 --> 21:21.760]  Well, she was CEO of Burberry and that's a huge job and people didn't understand why
[21:21.760 --> 21:25.320]  she would become a senior vice president at Apple, even though the senior vice president
[21:25.320 --> 21:28.800]  of retail and, and then now online as well as a huge job.
[21:28.800 --> 21:32.360]  It's, it's like being a CEO of another company, but it's still, I think you're exactly
[21:32.360 --> 21:33.360]  right.
[21:33.360 --> 21:36.440]  Apple, Apple dangled something in front of her that was a challenge and people like that
[21:36.440 --> 21:37.640]  want a challenge.
[21:37.640 --> 21:38.960]  Yeah, totally.
[21:38.960 --> 21:44.240]  Um, and it does seem, it seems, you know, it's not like we haven't really seen the
[21:44.240 --> 21:49.720]  arts effect on anything in retail yet, but I don't think there's anybody who doesn't
[21:49.720 --> 21:51.480]  think that that's coming.
[21:51.480 --> 21:52.720]  Yeah.
[21:52.720 --> 21:57.520]  You know, I think that there's half of it, I think, is that changes like that take a lot
[21:57.520 --> 22:04.320]  of time because it or not a lot of time, but a lot of time compared to our industry, right?
[22:04.320 --> 22:06.080]  Because you can't do it digitally.
[22:06.080 --> 22:11.360]  You can't just, you know, have a new store and, you know, I mean, you don't like
[22:11.360 --> 22:14.960]  they do with the online store, put up a sticky note for 15 minutes.
[22:14.960 --> 22:18.640]  And then when you come back, it's an all new store, you know, this brick and mortar stuff
[22:18.640 --> 22:25.000]  takes, visit, you know, actual time and, you know, to take a store down and put it back
[22:25.000 --> 22:30.120]  up is time when you're not to making sales, you know, so like in San Francisco, I don't
[22:30.120 --> 22:33.360]  know if the new store is open yet, but they're not putting the new store on the same
[22:33.360 --> 22:34.520]  spot as the old store.
[22:34.520 --> 22:39.160]  They're putting it like on the other corner around, what's the name of that part?
[22:39.160 --> 22:40.160]  Union Square?
[22:40.160 --> 22:41.160]  Yep.
[22:41.160 --> 22:47.160]  You know, you can't do that everywhere where Apple has a retail store, you know, most
[22:47.160 --> 22:53.640]  of the ones that are in shopping malls, you could, I guess, get another spot in the mall,
[22:53.640 --> 22:57.520]  but who knows if there's one, you know, it all depends on availability that's outside
[22:57.520 --> 22:59.000]  the control of Apple.
[22:59.000 --> 23:01.640]  And they're not like a carrier company who's going to just put a little kiosk out front
[23:01.640 --> 23:03.400]  and what the store is closed behind it.
[23:03.400 --> 23:04.400]  Right?
[23:04.400 --> 23:05.400]  Exactly.
[23:05.400 --> 23:11.880]  Yeah, I think, I think as the watch starts to deploy into the stores and as the other products
[23:11.880 --> 23:15.360]  start coming online for next year, we're going to see the store sort of transform to,
[23:15.360 --> 23:19.040]  I don't know if fashion is the right word, I think Apple's doing something really interesting
[23:19.040 --> 23:23.120]  where technology is meeting fashion, but it's going to be an Apple store that, that has
[23:23.120 --> 23:24.800]  to be different than it was in the past.
[23:24.800 --> 23:25.800]  Yeah.
[23:25.800 --> 23:26.800]  Let me see anything else.
[23:26.800 --> 23:27.800]  I don't really see it myself.
[23:27.800 --> 23:31.920]  Beats was, Beats, I think was announced earlier on in the year because they had Dre on
[23:31.920 --> 23:32.920]  the stage for WBC.
[23:32.920 --> 23:35.120]  So it must have been May 2014.
[23:35.120 --> 23:40.400]  Apple to acquire music, beats music, and beats electronics.
[23:40.400 --> 23:49.320]  I don't know that that's major news, because it's not a huge, it's a much bigger transaction
[23:49.320 --> 23:54.240]  than Apple has made, you know, famously, you know, it's the biggest acquisition since
[23:54.240 --> 23:59.840]  they acquired next, which of course, you know, is the, you know, turned into like the
[23:59.840 --> 24:03.760]  backbone of the country, of the company.
[24:03.760 --> 24:10.400]  But, you know, a $500 million acquisition in 1997 was like, was seriously about the company
[24:10.400 --> 24:16.480]  acquisition, whereas a, you know, $3 billion or whatever it cost acquisition to get beats
[24:16.480 --> 24:18.480]  is pocket change.
[24:18.480 --> 24:19.480]  Absolutely.
[24:19.480 --> 24:21.320]  Yeah, $300 billion, $3 billion.
[24:21.320 --> 24:25.880]  You know, I mean, you don't want to make a $3 billion acquisition that doesn't turn out
[24:25.880 --> 24:29.040]  well, but it certainly isn't going to have any meaningful.
[24:29.040 --> 24:32.520]  If it turned out to be a complete bust, it's not going to hurt the company.
[24:32.520 --> 24:35.640]  I think more interesting than the beats acquisition was just the reactions to it from, it
[24:35.640 --> 24:40.320]  was almost like everyone went through the five stages of grief with denial and anger, and
[24:40.320 --> 24:41.400]  they just couldn't believe it.
[24:41.400 --> 24:43.840]  And it turns out, it does make some sense.
[24:43.840 --> 24:47.480]  There are, you know, selling headphones at Apple stores makes a lot of sense, and sort of
[24:47.480 --> 24:51.000]  a synergy between iTunes radio and beats music, whatever it ends up being labeled makes
[24:51.000 --> 24:52.320]  a lot of sense.
[24:52.320 --> 24:59.560]  Yeah, and I think, I don't know, I still don't think overall it makes ton of sense.
[24:59.560 --> 25:04.520]  I'm still waiting for the other shoe to drop on it, but it's in some sense it does where
[25:04.520 --> 25:08.400]  it's the only other iconic headphone company I can think of.
[25:08.400 --> 25:15.240]  I mean, it has nothing to do with, you know, Marco Arman style, quality analysis, but
[25:15.240 --> 25:19.520]  rather you're out on the sidewalk and you see somebody walking while they're listening
[25:19.520 --> 25:24.240]  to their device and, you know, those white earbuds that Apple's been making ever since
[25:24.240 --> 25:30.320]  2001 are truly iconic, I mean, they even had for years an ad campaign that was kind of
[25:30.320 --> 25:36.080]  based on that, right, with the silhouettes dancing silhouettes who, you know, have white earbuds
[25:36.080 --> 25:41.760]  and a white Y, you know, connector draped around their body.
[25:41.760 --> 25:43.080]  They own that, right?
[25:43.080 --> 25:46.000]  Not that other companies, you know, that they have a trademark on it and nobody can make
[25:46.000 --> 25:50.400]  white earbuds, but white earbuds, people see them, they think that's somebody listening
[25:50.400 --> 25:51.880]  to an Apple device.
[25:51.880 --> 25:55.880]  And beats is the only other company I can think of that has that sort of recognition.
[25:55.880 --> 25:59.880]  Yeah, they have that, they have the cash aid that the iPod commercials used to have
[25:59.880 --> 26:04.080]  for 10 years ago, but I think there's also an element to Eddie Q's organization is just
[26:04.080 --> 26:06.680]  so big and there's going to be a limit at some point to what he can do.
[26:06.680 --> 26:10.400]  I mean, he's doing Apple Pay now as well and he does the app store and the iTunes store
[26:10.400 --> 26:12.680]  and he does all the contract negotiations.
[26:12.680 --> 26:16.760]  And if you could have Jimmy Iovian in there doing at least some of that, it takes more
[26:16.760 --> 26:18.960]  stuff off of Eddie Q's desk.
[26:18.960 --> 26:19.960]  Yeah.
[26:19.960 --> 26:22.560]  I heard, and it, you know, I don't think this is surprising.
[26:22.560 --> 26:27.520]  It's probably what everybody was guessing anyway, but what I have heard recently was that
[26:27.520 --> 26:35.040]  at least inside Apple, the Beats acquisition is viewed as an anything that Eddie, Eddie started
[26:35.040 --> 26:40.040]  it and he pushed for it and he drove it and not that that Tim Cook wasn't engaged and
[26:40.040 --> 26:43.400]  I'm sure that at the negotiation level he was in fact deeply engaged.
[26:43.400 --> 26:48.200]  I mean, I don't think, you know, Tim Cook has not like, don't worry about the details
[26:48.200 --> 26:52.080]  sort of CEO.
[26:52.080 --> 26:56.080]  So not to diminish what Tim Cook's role in the negotiations might have been, but in terms
[26:56.080 --> 27:03.520]  of advocating it and, you know, pushing for it, it was almost entirely an Eddie Q thing.
[27:03.520 --> 27:06.720]  That's interesting because we didn't see anything about iTunes this year.
[27:06.720 --> 27:10.640]  We didn't see continuity for iTunes, for example, we didn't see a new iTunes music
[27:10.640 --> 27:11.640]  service.
[27:11.640 --> 27:15.640]  iTunes radio still hasn't gone past the US and Australia, I think.
[27:15.640 --> 27:19.600]  iTunes is an aging platform, it's still based on web objects, it's still based on their
[27:19.600 --> 27:23.800]  original software they used to manage, you know, the music store and all of that at some
[27:23.800 --> 27:27.240]  point, you know, it's going to be like a John Syracuse thing where a thousand years from
[27:27.240 --> 27:28.480]  now, this is going to have to be fixed.
[27:28.480 --> 27:31.240]  So what's the point between now and then that it actually gets fixed?
[27:31.240 --> 27:35.000]  And I don't know if Beats has better software or better solution, but it could also be a catalyst
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.320]  to Apple finally fixing a lot of the infrastructure things that they have to do with the
[27:39.320 --> 27:40.320]  iTunes store.
[27:40.320 --> 27:46.120]  Yeah, I think, you know, above and beyond whether it's based on web objects, behind the scenes
[27:46.120 --> 27:52.760]  and all of that, I think it's ever more clear that it's based on a model that just isn't
[27:52.760 --> 28:01.080]  relevant anymore, which is, here's a song you want and you give a retailer money for it
[28:01.080 --> 28:05.880]  and now you own a copy of it, it's just not, that's just, that's done.
[28:05.880 --> 28:11.600]  I mean, I'm not done, not done in the sense of they're not selling any songs anymore,
[28:11.600 --> 28:18.480]  but that I can't see any way that that ever comes back, yes, it's, it's in permanent
[28:18.480 --> 28:19.480]  decline.
[28:19.480 --> 28:25.040]  It's sort of like what, what, like what standalone iPods are, you know, it's, you know, still
[28:25.040 --> 28:29.560]  a decent business, but it's, it's never going to increase quarter over quarter.
[28:29.560 --> 28:32.600]  It's going to go into permanent decline.
[28:32.600 --> 28:36.840]  And just like the iPod is being replaced by the iPhone, in some cases the iPad mini and
[28:36.840 --> 28:41.040]  now larger iPhones, it makes sense for whatever iTunes was, I forget it early enough to
[28:41.040 --> 28:42.800]  have whatever iTunes will end up being.
[28:42.800 --> 28:43.800]  Right.
[28:43.800 --> 28:44.800]  And it's, yeah.
[28:44.800 --> 28:48.800]  And in the same way that, you know, iPods sales decreasing doesn't mean that people are
[28:48.800 --> 28:52.880]  spending less time with gadgets that play music.
[28:52.880 --> 28:57.160]  In the same way, music sales declining doesn't mean people are spending less time listening
[28:57.160 --> 28:58.240]  to music.
[28:58.240 --> 29:01.920]  If anything, they're probably spending more, you know, I, I wouldn't be surprised if you
[29:01.920 --> 29:06.720]  did a study and found out that people listen to more music today, or at least time spent
[29:06.720 --> 29:09.200]  listening to music than ever before.
[29:09.200 --> 29:12.440]  It's just that the model is no longer buying and selling.
[29:12.440 --> 29:13.440]  Yeah.
[29:13.440 --> 29:15.560]  And it's not, it's not, it's not, you know, you had to buy it, it's not what you had to
[29:15.560 --> 29:16.560]  wait in the radio.
[29:16.560 --> 29:19.120]  People can get pretty much what they want, when they want, and that opens them up to just
[29:19.120 --> 29:21.720]  consuming it almost nonstop if they want to.
[29:21.720 --> 29:23.760]  Right.
[29:23.760 --> 29:28.000]  Um, so I don't know, I'm, I'm still not sure what to make of that.
[29:28.000 --> 29:35.320]  If it is the beats thing, an exception to the rule, just because it is, it, it, it combines
[29:35.320 --> 29:42.080]  two things that Apple wants to continue being a leader at, which is music listening hardware
[29:42.080 --> 29:47.480]  and a digital distribution of legal music.
[29:47.480 --> 29:52.800]  Is it just that, that beats is like a rare, perfect storm, you know, acquisition, or is
[29:52.800 --> 29:58.480]  it the sign of things to come that Apple is going to loosen up and become, you know, a company
[29:58.480 --> 30:04.200]  that does mid level or to high level acquisitions with some frequency?
[30:04.200 --> 30:07.200]  I think again, to your point about Apple just saying what they really feel, I think when
[30:07.200 --> 30:11.000]  Tim Cook says they're not religiously opposed to big acquisitions, I think he's absolutely
[30:11.000 --> 30:12.000]  sincere about that.
[30:12.000 --> 30:15.160]  They'll do them when they make sense, but it's got to be something like beats where it
[30:15.160 --> 30:16.480]  gives them a hardware product.
[30:16.480 --> 30:19.680]  They can sell the compliments and other hardware product, a service they can roll out the
[30:19.680 --> 30:24.480]  compliments and existing service and has executives that might be able to, you know, service
[30:24.480 --> 30:27.920]  it, sorry, executives and a culture that can integrate into Apple and help them do the things
[30:27.920 --> 30:28.920]  that they want to do.
[30:28.920 --> 30:29.920]  Right.
[30:29.920 --> 30:34.480]  And it doesn't really, that's the thing that has me, I'm still curious about it, but
[30:34.480 --> 30:40.560]  it doesn't make me worried about it the way that there's any number of other possible
[30:40.560 --> 30:46.240]  three billion dollar-ish acquisitions that Apple could have made that would raise my
[30:46.240 --> 30:51.080]  spidey sense, you know, in a way that beats doesn't because the biggest thing is that
[30:51.080 --> 30:57.280]  it doesn't fundamentally change any of the areas of focus in Apple's attention still
[30:57.280 --> 30:58.280]  last week.
[30:58.280 --> 31:05.280]  Right, which is exactly what, you know, to me is like the, the first canary I check in
[31:05.280 --> 31:10.440]  the coal mine is Apple losing focus and becoming more of a conglomerate, which I, you
[31:10.440 --> 31:11.440]  know, we don't know.
[31:11.440 --> 31:17.160]  I don't say that, I don't say that Apple becoming a multi-focused conglomerate would be
[31:17.160 --> 31:18.160]  bad.
[31:18.160 --> 31:25.000]  We just have no idea and there's no history for Apple as a, you know, whatever the revenue
[31:25.000 --> 31:29.000]  is, you know, 50 or to a hundred billion dollar a year corporation.
[31:29.000 --> 31:31.200]  I mean, you know, they're an uncharted territory period.
[31:31.200 --> 31:35.280]  There's, you know, they're the most valuable company, not just in tech, but anywhere.
[31:35.280 --> 31:43.440]  But it would be, so it wouldn't be, you know, them making seemingly unfocused acquisitions
[31:43.440 --> 31:49.360]  wouldn't make me sure that they were on the wrong track, but it would make me strongly
[31:49.360 --> 31:51.480]  suspected they were on the wrong track.
[31:51.480 --> 31:54.600]  Yeah, and it's wonder how the analysts would treat it because it wouldn't be expected
[31:54.600 --> 31:55.600]  behavior.
[31:55.600 --> 31:56.600]  Google can compete with everybody.
[31:56.600 --> 32:00.360]  They can compete with Amazon, with Apple, with Microsoft, with any tech company in
[32:00.360 --> 32:02.280]  the world and do it all at the same time.
[32:02.280 --> 32:05.320]  And that's fine and interesting and wonderful.
[32:05.320 --> 32:08.360]  But you'd probably, you'd probably hear how it was all the way across the valley if Apple
[32:08.360 --> 32:09.360]  started doing that.
[32:09.360 --> 32:10.360]  Yeah.
[32:10.360 --> 32:16.160]  Well, and Google can compete with itself, you know, Chrome books versus Android tablets
[32:16.160 --> 32:18.360]  is a perfect example.
[32:18.360 --> 32:19.880]  And I don't even say that that's a mistake.
[32:19.880 --> 32:27.080]  I think it kind of fits with Google's internal culture, whereas if Apple had seemingly
[32:27.080 --> 32:35.080]  confusing overlap between low-end MacBooks and iPads, I would find that worrisome.
[32:35.080 --> 32:36.080]  Yeah.
[32:36.080 --> 32:37.080]  Agreed.
[32:37.080 --> 32:43.120]  Like if Apple had a $3.99 MacBook, that to me would be very worrisome.
[32:43.120 --> 32:46.800]  I still have in the back of my head this idea that Google bought Android because they were
[32:46.800 --> 32:50.920]  panicked about mobile and then saw WebOS and smack their head and thought that was a way
[32:50.920 --> 32:53.280]  more Google product than buying Android.
[32:53.280 --> 32:54.480]  But then they were all in on Android.
[32:54.480 --> 32:58.520]  And now as they're slowly going to get a way to get Chrome OS to a point where that can
[32:58.520 --> 33:00.080]  be their version of WebOS.
[33:00.080 --> 33:01.080]  Yeah.
[33:01.080 --> 33:06.000]  That's an interesting, that's an interesting argument too, because I ended up hiring Matthias
[33:06.000 --> 33:07.000]  Duarte.
[33:07.000 --> 33:08.000]  Yep.
[33:08.000 --> 33:09.000]  Did I get his name right?
[33:09.000 --> 33:10.720]  Yeah, absolutely.
[33:10.720 --> 33:15.160]  Who was the lead designer behind WebOS?
[33:15.160 --> 33:16.160]  Yeah.
[33:16.160 --> 33:20.640]  And they're slowly giving send-up or tie control over the stack and he was, you know, he's
[33:20.640 --> 33:21.640]  the web guy.
[33:21.640 --> 33:24.680]  Android always seemed like an odd product from Google because it's a web company.
[33:24.680 --> 33:26.440]  And that was very native software.
[33:26.440 --> 33:27.640]  Yeah.
[33:27.640 --> 33:35.600]  And I really do think that it took a long time for Google or for Android, I should say two.
[33:35.600 --> 33:39.560]  Not to not at the low end, but at the sort of mid to high end to get any sort of foothold
[33:39.560 --> 33:45.840]  is that they were in such a deep hole design wise, you know, compared to the iPhone, that
[33:45.840 --> 33:51.840]  any, you know, even people who were inclined not to buy Apple stuff, people who haven't
[33:51.840 --> 33:55.800]  ever bought Apple stuff and sort of want to, you know, it's a natural thing, you know,
[33:55.800 --> 34:02.000]  people who've been sticking with the PC for years and sort of have an Apple is for other
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.640]  people sort of mindset about the company.
[34:05.640 --> 34:11.080]  You know, in 2011, even through 2012, you go into a store and compare the Android phones
[34:11.080 --> 34:15.800]  to iPhone, and it's, you know, you don't even have to be a design critic, you just see
[34:15.800 --> 34:20.760]  that there's a serious difference in fit and finish in the software.
[34:20.760 --> 34:24.640]  It was a very different, probably, I mean, Apple famously wanted to get, you know, the
[34:24.640 --> 34:28.720]  animation just absolutely nailed even in the first generation iPhone, but they didn't
[34:28.720 --> 34:33.080]  need to have every single feature crammed in there where Android was, it wasn't designed
[34:33.080 --> 34:34.080]  to be a phone for everybody.
[34:34.080 --> 34:38.320]  It was designed to be a phone that would protect Google's share of the web because they
[34:38.320 --> 34:42.880]  rightly believe web was moving mobile and their priority wasn't that sort of interactivity.
[34:42.880 --> 34:46.960]  They wanted to get, they bought, you know, Android and they made it work, but I remember
[34:46.960 --> 34:52.320]  even last year at CES, I was sitting there with the Nexus four or five, trying to use Gmail
[34:52.320 --> 34:57.000]  and just cursing out loud and Brian Klug from formerly of an Anteck came over and quickly
[34:57.000 --> 35:00.640]  put it in developer mode and the screen went bright red and he said, that's because they're
[35:00.640 --> 35:04.240]  redrawing every cell for five times, trying to hope that it would stick.
[35:04.240 --> 35:08.280]  And it's just, and their graphics, their own graphics engineers couldn't get their own Gmail
[35:08.280 --> 35:12.320]  engineers to properly code all of it and I think that's why they've really locked things
[35:12.320 --> 35:17.360]  down now with material design and all the new things, but it took them four or five years
[35:17.360 --> 35:21.200]  to fix the massive architectural problems that were causing poor interaction.
[35:21.200 --> 35:22.200]  Right.
[35:22.200 --> 35:26.360]  And the difference with WebOS is that WebOS right from the get go and had performance problems
[35:26.360 --> 35:32.800]  because of the whole architecture of building it on top of like a web kit rendering engine
[35:32.800 --> 35:41.600]  and combined with the state of mobile hardware in, what was it, 2009 when the pre came
[35:41.600 --> 35:44.240]  out.
[35:44.240 --> 35:50.840]  But I, you know, in terms of an elegant software interface, I mean, I mean, I, you could
[35:50.840 --> 35:55.960]  still, to this day, I think you could argue that the way that WebOS handled notifications
[35:55.960 --> 35:58.080]  is the best design anybody's come up with.
[35:58.080 --> 35:59.080]  Absolutely.
[35:59.080 --> 36:05.000]  I mean, it was almost the fringe universe version of the iPhone if John Rubenstein had won
[36:05.000 --> 36:10.320]  the keyboard argument, or what's his name, it won the Linux argument, or if the people
[36:10.320 --> 36:14.960]  who wanted to use WebKit as a interface instead of creating UIKit and one that argument,
[36:14.960 --> 36:16.520]  that could have been an Apple product.
[36:16.520 --> 36:17.520]  Right.
[36:17.520 --> 36:18.520]  Tony Fiddell.
[36:18.520 --> 36:19.520]  Tony Fiddell.
[36:19.520 --> 36:20.520]  Yeah.
[36:20.520 --> 36:23.400]  But instead they all ended up at Palm making except for Fiddell Rubenstein and the WebKit engineers
[36:23.400 --> 36:26.120]  ended up at Palm making their version of the iPhone.
[36:26.120 --> 36:27.120]  Yeah.
[36:27.120 --> 36:28.120]  Absolutely.
[36:28.120 --> 36:35.160]  So if you would have shown, if you'd have taken a Palm pre back in time to, you know,
[36:35.160 --> 36:40.880]  1998, 1997 and shown it to my then self and said, what company, you know, this is a product
[36:40.880 --> 36:44.440]  from 2009, what company made it, you know, scrub the logos off.
[36:44.440 --> 36:49.320]  I would have guessed Apple without question, especially if you just showed me the software
[36:49.320 --> 36:55.160]  and not the hardware, the hardware was a lot less Appley, but the software was extremely
[36:55.160 --> 36:57.000]  Appley, in my opinion.
[36:57.000 --> 37:02.120]  Something from the font choice to, you know, the roundness, you know, the rounded corners
[37:02.120 --> 37:08.320]  of the screen, the rounded corners of the cards on the screen.
[37:08.320 --> 37:11.960]  I think it was a very Apple DNA product software wise.
[37:11.960 --> 37:16.360]  I've never seen the P1 phone that Fiddell's group was working on, but in, I've always
[37:16.360 --> 37:19.920]  suspected that if that had been the phone that I got the gone ahead of some reason P2 hadn't
[37:19.920 --> 37:23.440]  worked out and, for us, I was group hadn't been able to make the iPhone.
[37:23.440 --> 37:26.280]  That could have ended up being very similar to what the Palm pre was.
[37:26.280 --> 37:30.760]  And so it's interesting to think hypothetically what would have happened if Google had purchased
[37:30.760 --> 37:37.080]  at somehow obtained WebOS instead of Android and pushed for it, because in some sense,
[37:37.080 --> 37:42.560]  the problems that WebOS had were, I think, not solvable by throwing money at them, but
[37:42.560 --> 37:48.680]  more easily solved by throwing money at it than Android, because with the Android, it was,
[37:48.680 --> 37:54.280]  to me, fundamentally, the fact that it was designed at the outset as a sort of blackberry
[37:54.280 --> 38:00.240]  style, you know, that it was going to, you know, a blackberry style mobile interface, keyboard,
[38:00.240 --> 38:03.480]  up, down, left, right, select.
[38:03.480 --> 38:11.040]  And therefore had no, no, no, at a foundation level aspect of, of a rich graphical interface
[38:11.040 --> 38:15.200]  with playful animations and high frame rates and stuff like that.
[38:15.200 --> 38:18.400]  I've told the story before, but when I reviewed the G1, the very first Android phone
[38:18.400 --> 38:22.160]  that came out, I turned on the snake game and it said, press up to start, and I tried,
[38:22.160 --> 38:25.160]  you know, swiping up on the screen, then I tried pressing the up arrow key, then I tried
[38:25.160 --> 38:28.600]  pressing the up joy pad, and then I tried pressing up on whatever the other thing was
[38:28.600 --> 38:29.600]  on the other side.
[38:29.600 --> 38:32.680]  I tried eight different ways of signaling up, and I couldn't get it to work, but there were
[38:32.680 --> 38:36.800]  eight different ways of signaling up, and that, to me, defined the very early years of
[38:36.800 --> 38:37.800]  Android.
[38:37.800 --> 38:42.240]  I remember, too, that it was the only way to select text was to use the up down left
[38:42.240 --> 38:43.240]  right.
[38:43.240 --> 38:45.720]  There was no way to touch on the screen to select text.
[38:45.720 --> 38:49.600]  You had to, you know, more or less use like arrow keys.
[38:49.600 --> 38:53.240]  And the original one, you close the keyboard and there'd be the Google search box just
[38:53.240 --> 38:54.240]  blinking it.
[38:54.240 --> 38:57.040]  You're wanting you to put text, but there was no virtual keyboard, so you couldn't input
[38:57.040 --> 38:58.040]  text.
[38:58.040 --> 39:01.360]  I remember that, too.
[39:01.360 --> 39:04.840]  And that's sort of the problems they were facing, and POM was a tiny team, and they
[39:04.840 --> 39:09.360]  coded circles around Google when it came to phones in 2009.
[39:09.360 --> 39:18.840]  So anyway, that's an interesting what if, and to me, it's of the last, of the post-PC
[39:18.840 --> 39:26.200]  era, you know, from 2007 on the great tragedy of the whole thing is that WebOS never, you
[39:26.200 --> 39:30.400]  know, didn't get a long enough time to try to gain a foothold, agreed.
[39:30.400 --> 39:36.640]  You know, I mean, I, I think it was a more elegant design than Windows Phone.
[39:36.640 --> 39:42.000]  And so just imagine if they had had somebody with the wherewithal that Microsoft has shown
[39:42.000 --> 39:48.760]  with Windows Phone to stick behind WebOS, you know, and, you know, push the software forward
[39:48.760 --> 39:52.240]  and break some of the bottom performance bottlenecks.
[39:52.240 --> 39:58.040]  But also just let Moore's law help you out year after year, you know, two, three years
[39:58.040 --> 40:04.800]  later, WebOS, I think, would have been a lot more, without even any software optimizations,
[40:04.800 --> 40:07.600]  would have been a lot more tenable performance-wise.
[40:07.600 --> 40:08.600]  Absolutely.
[40:08.600 --> 40:11.840]  I mean, they had no secondary source of income, Apple had Mac money originally, Google had
[40:11.840 --> 40:16.400]  search money, even Samsung had appliance money, POM and now Blackberry, they have no additional
[40:16.400 --> 40:20.160]  sources of income, and so everything becomes, everything becomes better company, every
[40:20.160 --> 40:22.120]  phone you put out becomes better company.
[40:22.120 --> 40:23.120]  Yeah.
[40:23.120 --> 40:24.120]  All right.
[40:24.120 --> 40:28.040]  Let me take a break and thank our first sponsor this week, and it is our very good friends
[40:28.040 --> 40:29.440]  at backblays.
[40:29.440 --> 40:35.320]  You guys know backblays, unlimited, unthrottle backup for Mac.
[40:35.320 --> 40:40.120]  They have over 100 petabytes of total data backed up.
[40:40.120 --> 40:43.360]  They just crossed the 6 billion files restored mark.
[40:43.360 --> 40:49.640]  That means users of backblays have used them to restore or download or get on another device
[40:49.640 --> 40:53.840]  over 6 billion files.
[40:53.840 --> 40:57.680]  They have an iPhone app that lets you access and share any of your files.
[40:57.680 --> 41:00.640]  So when you're max backed up to backblays, you're out and about all you have with you
[41:00.640 --> 41:04.200]  is your phone and you want to get a file from your Mac.
[41:04.200 --> 41:08.160]  Just log in to, just open the backblays app and there's all your files, get it.
[41:08.160 --> 41:11.000]  You can email it to someone right from there.
[41:11.000 --> 41:14.760]  You don't need to do anything more complicated than that, couldn't be easier.
[41:14.760 --> 41:23.360]  You can restore one file or all your files easily with their web restore, 25% of all backblays
[41:23.360 --> 41:26.400]  restores are for just one file.
[41:26.400 --> 41:28.840]  So it's not just for computer disasters.
[41:28.840 --> 41:32.920]  But if you do have a computer disaster, somebody steals your Mac, somebody breaks in your
[41:32.920 --> 41:39.360]  house, takes your Mac, takes your backup drive, your roof leaks, water leaks all over
[41:39.360 --> 41:44.480]  your computer, ruins your hard drive, ruins your time machine.
[41:44.480 --> 41:47.240]  You need to, you know, true total disaster.
[41:47.240 --> 41:51.240]  You can just, you don't have to wait and download all of your stuff from backblays
[41:51.240 --> 41:52.400]  over the internet.
[41:52.400 --> 41:57.440]  You can just go there, say put it all on a USB hard drive and boom, they'll FedEx it
[41:57.440 --> 42:01.800]  to you and you know, like a day or two later, there's a USB hard drive with all of your
[42:01.800 --> 42:06.480]  files on it, ready for you to restore to a new computer.
[42:06.480 --> 42:13.760]  Software's written by, the company's founded by AppleX engineers, the software runs totally
[42:13.760 --> 42:20.160]  native on your Mac, runs great on Yosemite, runs great on Mavericks, couldn't be installed
[42:20.160 --> 42:26.160]  more easily, couldn't be more invisible in the background while it's running.
[42:26.160 --> 42:33.640]  Just great, great service for an amazing price, five bucks a month per Mac, unlimited,
[42:33.640 --> 42:36.240]  no limits on how much data you can upload.
[42:36.240 --> 42:37.800]  Five bucks a month.
[42:37.800 --> 42:42.920]  So you can get a risk-free, no credit card required trial by going here.
[42:42.920 --> 42:48.760]  Backblays.com slash daring fireball, you're not to be haven't done it.
[42:48.760 --> 42:53.520]  And if you're listening to this over the holidays, sign your parents up for it.
[42:53.520 --> 42:57.400]  Just go, when you're at your parents house or for Christmas or whatever, just sign them
[42:57.400 --> 43:01.800]  up for backblays and give it to them, it's a great little gift.
[43:01.800 --> 43:04.640]  They won't thank you for it until they need it, but then when they need it, they'll think
[43:04.640 --> 43:05.840]  you're a superhero.
[43:05.840 --> 43:10.440]  So put all your relatives on backblays, my thanks to them.
[43:10.440 --> 43:15.320]  So the first big Apple news of the year, 2014, really didn't come to WWDC.
[43:15.320 --> 43:16.320]  Yeah.
[43:16.320 --> 43:17.320]  What an event.
[43:17.320 --> 43:23.680]  Yeah, I think it was, it's certainly, it still seems like, it doesn't seem like as long
[43:23.680 --> 43:26.680]  ago as it does, it doesn't feel like six months ago.
[43:26.680 --> 43:32.600]  No, it was amazing because I was sitting with you and Jason Snell and John Syracuse,
[43:32.600 --> 43:36.440]  and different people were just lighting up at different parts of that event.
[43:36.440 --> 43:39.960]  It was just a palpable reaction for them.
[43:39.960 --> 43:41.600]  Syracuse and Swift, all right.
[43:41.600 --> 43:44.440]  Well, he turned to Snell and he goes, am I dreaming because if I'm, you should tell me
[43:44.440 --> 43:45.640]  because I might be in a fugue state.
[43:45.640 --> 43:47.000]  I don't know if this is real or not.
[43:47.000 --> 43:51.480]  Please tell me that I'm actually listening to what I'm listening to.
[43:51.480 --> 43:53.880]  That was certainly big news.
[43:53.880 --> 44:01.280]  You know, I was eight and Yosemite, it was the first time we got to look at Yosemite.
[44:01.280 --> 44:09.280]  And I think, you know, certain, how should we say it?
[44:09.280 --> 44:14.920]  Not like a specific, you know, like, here's three lines of code to copy these exactly.
[44:14.920 --> 44:17.600]  This is how you do X recommended way.
[44:17.600 --> 44:23.360]  But more in terms of like broad strokes philosophy, I think Apple started pushing a couple
[44:23.360 --> 44:28.600]  of new things, not necessarily for the first time, but two examples I can think of was
[44:28.600 --> 44:39.080]  the heavy focus on dynamic user interface layout, clearly preshadowing, you know, in the
[44:39.080 --> 44:43.920]  run up to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.
[44:43.920 --> 44:51.240]  But I think in the long run, more envisioning a world of iOS devices where there's a continuum
[44:51.240 --> 44:56.280]  of screen sizes, you know, and who knows, maybe eventually something smaller than four
[44:56.280 --> 44:59.920]  inches.
[44:59.920 --> 45:03.520]  And you know, by all accounts, maybe one of the things, you know, that would be hearing about
[45:03.520 --> 45:09.160]  in 25 early parts of 2015 would be a bigger screen, some kind of iPad that's bigger than
[45:09.160 --> 45:11.200]  9.7 inches.
[45:11.200 --> 45:19.160]  And not having to, you know, code a custom user interface for each size in that continuum.
[45:19.160 --> 45:23.680]  It's a definite, it's a huge change from the way iOS development was until recently.
[45:23.680 --> 45:29.640]  And it's, you know, it wasn't just about supporting the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.
[45:29.640 --> 45:33.280]  The way I look at it, there's, there was an introductory, sorry, the integration theme,
[45:33.280 --> 45:36.640]  which we'll probably get to, but the other big theme was this transition from push from
[45:36.640 --> 45:41.280]  pull to push, where previously the interface was locked to the device and then slowly
[45:41.280 --> 45:46.080]  but surely with things like air play and car play and now watch kit.
[45:46.080 --> 45:49.960]  The interface is actually decoupled, so you have the logic on one device and the interface
[45:49.960 --> 45:53.800]  going somewhere else, or you have the logic for the app at the interface being able to
[45:53.800 --> 45:57.800]  be flexible between, you know, the four inch screen size 4.76 inch.
[45:57.800 --> 46:01.240]  Now that you have split view controllers on the iPhone 6 Plus, it's sort of like a mini
[46:01.240 --> 46:02.240]  iPad.
[46:02.240 --> 46:06.960]  So like you said, it can scale across those things, but it's, it's all sort of one central
[46:06.960 --> 46:08.600]  part of logic.
[46:08.600 --> 46:12.440]  And then you add extensibility to it where previously you had to hunt around your iPhone
[46:12.440 --> 46:13.440]  for anything.
[46:13.440 --> 46:17.200]  You had to go between six different photo apps just to, just to get the effects you wanted.
[46:17.200 --> 46:19.960]  You had to leave to, to reply to a message.
[46:19.960 --> 46:22.720]  You had to leave if you wanted to share the tumblr, you couldn't do that from where you
[46:22.720 --> 46:24.600]  were yet to go to the tumblr app and do it.
[46:24.600 --> 46:27.440]  And now all of that functionality has come to one place.
[46:27.440 --> 46:28.840]  All of that is now independent.
[46:28.840 --> 46:30.360]  You have these remote views.
[46:30.360 --> 46:34.280]  And to me, that's made that, that sort of severing of that one unit into these more modular
[46:34.280 --> 46:38.320]  parts has really made a huge difference, not just in my workflow, but where I think Apple
[46:38.320 --> 46:42.840]  could take all these, I think it's the first big hint of much larger plans they have moving
[46:42.840 --> 46:44.240]  forward with these devices.
[46:44.240 --> 46:48.120]  Right, and you've mentioned both car play, which is that's how car play works, where
[46:48.120 --> 46:55.800]  car play is a dumb terminal effectively and, you know, take your iPhone out of Bluetooth range
[46:55.800 --> 47:00.480]  and the only thing the screen is going to show you in your car is the, the stuff from
[47:00.480 --> 47:01.480]  the manufacturer.
[47:01.480 --> 47:09.400]  You're not going to get any of the Apple play stuff or car play stuff, no iOS at all.
[47:09.400 --> 47:12.960]  It's only a, it's really just effectively a projector.
[47:12.960 --> 47:17.600]  Your iPhone is doing all of the computation, your iPhone is all of the storage, your iPhone
[47:17.600 --> 47:21.440]  is doing the networking for anything that's coming over cellular.
[47:21.440 --> 47:27.640]  And the only thing that the screen in your car does is show you what the iPhone is showing
[47:27.640 --> 47:34.080]  and report back to the phone where you're stabbing your fingers at it.
[47:34.080 --> 47:39.520]  And the watch, you know, was we now know, and as, you know, countless people have, you
[47:39.520 --> 47:46.440]  know, the initial watch kit SDK shows, for the first round of third party apps, pretty
[47:46.440 --> 47:48.360]  much works the same way.
[47:48.360 --> 47:49.840]  You don't get to run any code.
[47:49.840 --> 47:56.200]  There's no part of watch, this initial watch kit where your app runs code on the watch.
[47:56.200 --> 48:02.880]  It's just a projected display of what your phone app, your iPhone app is showing it.
[48:02.880 --> 48:07.000]  And then the watch just reports back what you tapped on.
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.760]  I would like that everywhere, I like the idea of car play.
[48:09.760 --> 48:13.400]  I bought the Toyota car before they had any integration at all.
[48:13.400 --> 48:16.360]  And my only option is to buy a new car if I want anything.
[48:16.360 --> 48:20.880]  But with car play, every time I upgrade iOS or upgrade my phone, I get a better experience.
[48:20.880 --> 48:25.000]  I'd like that on my camera, I'd like camera play so that my Canon interface is replaced
[48:25.000 --> 48:26.000]  with iOS.
[48:26.000 --> 48:27.000]  I don't want to have Android appliances at all.
[48:27.000 --> 48:30.560]  I want to have them running iOS just, anytime there's a screen, I would eventually like
[48:30.560 --> 48:34.640]  to be able to just put like, like project iOS right onto it.
[48:34.640 --> 48:40.360]  So, doing that with a camera, like a camera, you know, like a serious camera would be
[48:40.360 --> 48:41.360]  fascinating.
[48:41.360 --> 48:46.800]  I mean, there is a move of foot in the camera world to build in Wi-Fi.
[48:46.800 --> 48:49.720]  But it's, I don't, and I don't have a camera that does it yet.
[48:49.720 --> 48:57.560]  You know, my Fuji X100S is a year off, like the brand new X100T, which just came out a
[48:57.560 --> 49:02.440]  few weeks ago and I linked to a review of it a couple of days ago, now has Wi-Fi.
[49:02.440 --> 49:06.200]  But it's clunky, like the only way to get it to work, I haven't seen it, but it's like
[49:06.200 --> 49:11.840]  you have to get a Fuji app from the app store and then open the Fuji app on your phone
[49:11.840 --> 49:17.400]  and then you can do something between your phone and the camera.
[49:17.400 --> 49:20.880]  Whereas having it be like car play, man, that would be fantastic.
[49:20.880 --> 49:24.080]  And it's great for Apple because they're never going to get into, well, never as long
[49:24.080 --> 49:25.880]  time, but they're not going to get into making appliances.
[49:25.880 --> 49:28.800]  They're not going to become a giant manufacturing conglomerate like Samsung.
[49:28.800 --> 49:32.600]  And they're not going to license iOS the way that Android is easily able to be put on
[49:32.600 --> 49:36.080]  any device, but just projecting the interface, it means they can still control it.
[49:36.080 --> 49:39.920]  They in essence just take it over and the customer will have a great experience and they
[49:39.920 --> 49:42.800]  don't have to relinquish any of the control that they need for products.
[49:42.800 --> 49:47.040]  Yeah, it almost to me takes cameras back to where they were pre-digital, right?
[49:47.040 --> 49:50.520]  Where when you load it, we had a 35 millimeter film camera.
[49:50.520 --> 49:54.880]  The only things the camera did was let you take pictures, right?
[49:54.880 --> 49:59.080]  It would look the review finder and see and the camera would have things like a light
[49:59.080 --> 50:00.640]  set in the latter years.
[50:00.640 --> 50:03.040]  Obviously in the early years, you had to set all that stuff manually.
[50:03.040 --> 50:10.160]  But by the latter years of the tail end of the film world, it would do the exposure.
[50:10.160 --> 50:18.520]  If you set things to auto, it would set the aperture, set the exposure time.
[50:18.520 --> 50:22.400]  And then, but it was all just about letting you take the next photo.
[50:22.400 --> 50:24.440]  Then you'd push the button and the photo would be taken.
[50:24.440 --> 50:28.760]  It would be stored on the film and that was it, right?
[50:28.760 --> 50:30.880]  I would like a digital camera that worked like that.
[50:30.880 --> 50:36.120]  Do whatever you can to help me get a perfect exposure and focus, you know, set the focus
[50:36.120 --> 50:40.360]  distance, give me a recommended aperture, give me a recommended exposure time.
[50:40.360 --> 50:44.040]  Or let me set any of those variables manually if I choose to.
[50:44.040 --> 50:50.360]  And then when I hit click, it just store the photo and then let me do everything else
[50:50.360 --> 50:53.120]  over a wireless connection to my iPhone.
[50:53.120 --> 50:54.800]  I would love that.
[50:54.800 --> 50:55.800]  For a couple reasons.
[50:55.800 --> 50:59.240]  One, if you don't have an iPhone, you would just get whatever the CUNIX car play system
[50:59.240 --> 51:02.200]  is, you know, for the, whatever the standard software is on the phone.
[51:02.200 --> 51:05.000]  But if you do have it, you get a better experience and that becomes the same reason
[51:05.000 --> 51:08.360]  you'd want to get car play, you know, this stuff all works better if you happen to have
[51:08.360 --> 51:09.360]  an iPhone.
[51:09.360 --> 51:10.360]  Yeah.
[51:10.360 --> 51:11.440]  Boy, that would be great.
[51:11.440 --> 51:12.440]  Yeah.
[51:12.440 --> 51:19.960]  But I do totally think that, you know, the WWDC 2014, Harold did that sort of, you know, future.
[51:19.960 --> 51:23.480]  I think so too. And I think we also see, for example, continuity is going to work on
[51:23.480 --> 51:25.520]  the watch because there's going to be things on the watch.
[51:25.520 --> 51:27.680]  The watch to me is a total convenience play.
[51:27.680 --> 51:31.040]  It's for all those thousands of tiny interactions that you have with your phone every
[51:31.040 --> 51:34.880]  day that aren't that don't take a lot of time, but are super important yet you still
[51:34.880 --> 51:38.120]  have to go to your bag or go to your purse or go to your pocket.
[51:38.120 --> 51:40.360]  And I can sort of shift those to my watch.
[51:40.360 --> 51:43.480]  But if something ends up being more important than I thought it was being able to just
[51:43.480 --> 51:47.720]  send that right back to my phone and continue on my phone, sync is great.
[51:47.720 --> 51:51.560]  But with sync, I still have to unlock the phone, go find the app, go to the same place
[51:51.560 --> 51:53.800]  what I was scroll through or try to find it.
[51:53.800 --> 51:57.320]  But with continuity, I can be looking at something, press a button and that exact same
[51:57.320 --> 51:59.080]  thing as just they're waiting for me again.
[51:59.080 --> 52:02.720]  I think that's going to be much, much more interesting when the watch is in play.
[52:02.720 --> 52:03.720]  Yeah.
[52:03.720 --> 52:04.720]  I do.
[52:04.720 --> 52:07.360]  And I think a lot of these things are sort of breaking.
[52:07.360 --> 52:14.320]  It goes back to what I said earlier about Apple Pay, where it's at a, from a user's perspective,
[52:14.320 --> 52:19.280]  it's outside the app-centric world of using the phone itself.
[52:19.280 --> 52:26.200]  It's, it's much more about the real physical world, where your phone is just within the
[52:26.200 --> 52:33.440]  Bluetooth and or Wi-Fi, you know, wireless range of whatever terminal you're dealing with,
[52:33.440 --> 52:38.040]  whether the terminal is your watch, whether it's your dashboard in your car.
[52:38.040 --> 52:40.600]  And you just tap on the watch and things get started.
[52:40.600 --> 52:41.880]  You don't have to wake up your phone.
[52:41.880 --> 52:47.640]  You don't, and you definitely don't have to find any particular app, like a Fuji app
[52:47.640 --> 52:49.480]  to get, you know, to get this to work.
[52:49.480 --> 52:53.040]  You're just on your camera and hit a button on your camera.
[52:53.040 --> 52:56.520]  And you know, the phone interface just wakes up and starts, you know, can read those
[52:56.520 --> 52:58.280]  photos that are right on your phone.
[52:58.280 --> 53:01.200]  The phone becomes like the star destroyer and the watch becomes the shuttle craft that
[53:01.200 --> 53:03.560]  moves you in between the big objects.
[53:03.560 --> 53:07.880]  It's pretty good.
[53:07.880 --> 53:11.680]  I like that.
[53:11.680 --> 53:13.120]  What else from WWDC?
[53:13.120 --> 53:18.080]  I guess Yosemite, we could, you know, and in the summer there wasn't really any news
[53:18.080 --> 53:19.080]  per se.
[53:19.080 --> 53:22.080]  It was just, you know, beta's of iOS and Yosemite.
[53:22.080 --> 53:26.560]  Not a bad way to just roll into, we're going to talk 2014 in hindsight.
[53:26.560 --> 53:27.560]  Yeah.
[53:27.560 --> 53:29.200]  I mean, have to talk to Yosemite.
[53:29.200 --> 53:30.200]  Yeah.
[53:30.200 --> 53:33.920]  I mean, Dave Wiscus did an article on mackerel right beforehand where you were sort of speculating
[53:33.920 --> 53:36.120]  of what Yosemite would end up looking like.
[53:36.120 --> 53:37.840]  And I think he was really, really close.
[53:37.840 --> 53:42.560]  Like Apple didn't just clone iOS 7, which was a long-running joke.
[53:42.560 --> 53:47.040]  They sort of took the cues from it, the translucency and the other effects and they made
[53:47.040 --> 53:50.800]  something that was very Mac and, you know, they kept the shadows, for example.
[53:50.800 --> 53:51.800]  Yeah.
[53:51.800 --> 53:58.920]  Our example, when Dave and I were noodling ideas for Vesper Mac before we saw Yosemite,
[53:58.920 --> 54:03.880]  and we thought, well, what if they do totally just go all in iOS 7 looking feel?
[54:03.880 --> 54:10.680]  And the only thing we could come up with was the iCloud web apps, which are, you know,
[54:10.680 --> 54:15.240]  you use them with a mouse pointer and, you know, I think, typically, I don't even think
[54:15.240 --> 54:17.320]  they run on an iPad.
[54:17.320 --> 54:22.760]  So I mean, you're using it on a Mac and they have some things like dialog boxes that,
[54:22.760 --> 54:31.000]  you know, it's like, you know, how would you do an iOS 7 dialog box with a mouse pointer?
[54:31.000 --> 54:35.000]  But overall, boy, we looked at that and we were like, boy, I hope that's not it.
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.400]  No, it wasn't.
[54:37.400 --> 54:40.920]  It had to be enough, because they did that back to the Mac event and they changed the
[54:40.920 --> 54:44.520]  names of the apps and they brought over the same looking feel and they really made an
[54:44.520 --> 54:49.080]  effort to get all the people who had iOS devices, not to make the Mac the same, but to
[54:49.080 --> 54:52.680]  make them comfortable, to make an easy sort of a halo effect transition.
[54:52.680 --> 54:56.240]  And when you look at Yosemite and you look at continuity, it's just about adding value.
[54:56.240 --> 55:01.360]  Again, if you have an iPhone or iPad, you'll have a much better experience with a Mac.
[55:01.360 --> 55:02.560]  Yeah, absolutely.
[55:02.560 --> 55:07.960]  I do think, too, that shows, and part of it is, you know, our perspective where we get
[55:07.960 --> 55:12.080]  to go to these press events and talk to some of the people at Apple, like in the product
[55:12.080 --> 55:15.000]  marketing group.
[55:15.000 --> 55:16.800]  And there's a palpable sense.
[55:16.800 --> 55:19.360]  I mean, there's some things that they just never come up.
[55:19.360 --> 55:24.560]  I mean, nobody really spends a long time talking about the, we don't even call them
[55:24.560 --> 55:26.720]  that anymore, but like the iWorks apps, right?
[55:26.720 --> 55:32.640]  Like pages and numbers and keynotes, they, you know, there's, hasn't been a lot of enthusiasm
[55:32.640 --> 55:34.880]  about those apps in recent years.
[55:34.880 --> 55:36.760]  I'm not saying there's none.
[55:36.760 --> 55:42.600]  I'm just saying that it's, you know, I think it shows in the real world and, you know,
[55:42.600 --> 55:44.560]  in this current state of those apps.
[55:44.560 --> 55:48.440]  And I think it shows in the enthusiasm when you talk to people at Apple privately.
[55:48.440 --> 55:52.280]  But whereas like the Mac overall and Yosemite overall, like there were people, there's people
[55:52.280 --> 55:54.960]  at Apple who just still love the Mac.
[55:54.960 --> 56:02.760]  Like as a whole, it is not like the, you know, forgotten first child, you know, brushed
[56:02.760 --> 56:09.920]  aside in favor of the beloved, you know, iOS, you know, I wonder if that has anything to
[56:09.920 --> 56:14.640]  do with the Mac, like Yosemite being very firmly in Federigis org, but things like iWork
[56:14.640 --> 56:18.600]  and iTunes all being projects that are run by in Q's org, you know, it's like a totally
[56:18.600 --> 56:21.760]  secondary software development system.
[56:21.760 --> 56:23.520]  I do wonder about that.
[56:23.520 --> 56:31.480]  And I don't know if it's because it's anyway to, to slag any Q, but almost that he's got
[56:31.480 --> 56:36.600]  so much on his plate that how could it get any more of his attention, you know, with how
[56:36.600 --> 56:38.560]  much that he's got on his plate.
[56:38.560 --> 56:42.240]  And you don't have the Federigi, you don't like the one guy who's in charge of software
[56:42.240 --> 56:44.960]  engineering isn't in charge of those bits of software engineering.
[56:44.960 --> 56:51.000]  But as a whole, I, you know, this year, I think that the people I've spoken to at Apple
[56:51.000 --> 56:55.520]  were more excited about Yosemite and what's new on the Mac than iOS 8.
[56:55.520 --> 56:58.840]  And you know, and a lot of it is hard to separate because so much of what's new about
[56:58.840 --> 57:03.200]  both iOS 8 and Yosemite is the continuity stuff which ties them together.
[57:03.200 --> 57:05.960]  And there is no one without the other.
[57:05.960 --> 57:09.760]  That was one of the most impressive things to me because the famously iOS and OS X used
[57:09.760 --> 57:11.480]  to be run separately.
[57:11.480 --> 57:15.080]  And there was a big rework, but not only that, it's, it's, it's filtered down.
[57:15.080 --> 57:19.160]  So instead of having someone in charge of Yosemite and someone in charge of iOS, the person
[57:19.160 --> 57:24.440]  who was in charge of extensibility or the, at least the entering product manager, was in
[57:24.440 --> 57:29.680]  charge of extensibility for iOS and OS X. It was in charge of continuity for iOS and iOS
[57:29.680 --> 57:33.240]  X. And even when it would have been easier to do them separately or do them in different
[57:33.240 --> 57:35.520]  ways, they made sure that they were done in the same way.
[57:35.520 --> 57:38.680]  So developers had just one way to target them on both systems.
[57:38.680 --> 57:41.800]  And that might be a subtle change, but I think that's a really profound change based on
[57:41.800 --> 57:43.320]  how Apple used to be run.
[57:43.320 --> 57:49.520]  Yeah. And I, I, you know, it's a recurring theme, you know, since he left the company,
[57:49.520 --> 57:51.400]  but, you know, with four stall.
[57:51.400 --> 57:54.200]  And again, overall, I'm a big fan of four stall.
[57:54.200 --> 58:01.440]  And I think, you know, four, Scott four stall is a huge reason that the iPhone was a hit
[58:01.440 --> 58:02.440]  product.
[58:02.440 --> 58:03.440]  It's as good as it was.
[58:03.440 --> 58:09.720]  I think he is a huge reason that the app store exists and that it's as popular as it is.
[58:09.720 --> 58:10.720]  Problems aside.
[58:10.720 --> 58:13.720]  That's because there's been a lot of recent problems with the app store.
[58:13.720 --> 58:19.840]  But on the whole, you know, it's, you know, a success.
[58:19.840 --> 58:25.160]  And you know, at a time when in 2007 when the first iPhone came out and there wasn't any
[58:25.160 --> 58:27.640]  third party software at all.
[58:27.640 --> 58:30.280]  And there were questions about whether there ever would be.
[58:30.280 --> 58:33.880]  And then even when it was announced, well, how how strict are they going to keep this?
[58:33.880 --> 58:37.920]  How much is it going to be a handful of apps that Apple vets and how much is it going
[58:37.920 --> 58:43.600]  to be, you know, are they going to allow tens of thousands, hundreds, thousands of apps?
[58:43.600 --> 58:47.560]  I think all of that is thanks to four stall, or at least, at least partly thanks to four
[58:47.560 --> 58:48.560]  stall.
[58:48.560 --> 58:49.560]  Absolutely.
[58:49.560 --> 58:52.480]  But on the other hand, I don't think continuity happens.
[58:52.480 --> 58:54.880]  All in one fell swoop in 2014.
[58:54.880 --> 59:02.400]  If four stall is still running iOS as his own fiefdom because the way he ran it was secretly
[59:02.400 --> 59:08.520]  even when it wasn't new, you know, even, you know, it, you know, 20, 2012, I guess when
[59:08.520 --> 59:16.000]  he got pushed out, you know, I think he was a phenomenal partner for Steve Jobs.
[59:16.000 --> 59:21.760]  You know, your stories about when he was at Apple, he knew which of the three studded
[59:21.760 --> 59:25.520]  leather textures, Steve would pick and when he wasn't there, the designers just kept
[59:25.520 --> 59:27.560]  hearing no and no and no over and over again.
[59:27.560 --> 59:31.160]  And he was just so good at working with Steve Jobs, but then, you know, he faced an Apple
[59:31.160 --> 59:32.640]  without Steve Jobs.
[59:32.640 --> 59:36.680]  And it's possible that he was the best person in the world to birth the iPhone, but not the
[59:36.680 --> 59:38.880]  best person to get it through the awkward teenage years.
[59:38.880 --> 59:42.520]  And we'll see that with the watch now because Kevin Lynch runs Watch Software at Apple.
[59:42.520 --> 59:46.280]  It's not in Craig Federigis or, but that's sort of what you have to do when you're creating
[59:46.280 --> 59:47.280]  something new.
[59:47.280 --> 59:50.480]  You have to give it that sort of independent space to come alive and then you integrate
[59:50.480 --> 59:51.840]  it back again over time.
[59:51.840 --> 59:52.840]  Right.
[59:52.840 --> 59:56.720]  But even with Lynch and, you know, that's a good open question as in terms of like what
[59:56.720 --> 59:58.560]  to look for in 2015.
[59:58.560 --> 1:00:04.200]  You know, it's how good is their initial Watch Software going to be?
[1:00:04.200 --> 1:00:09.360]  And you know, whether it's fair or not, you know, how good the initial like when we get
[1:00:09.360 --> 1:00:19.600]  our first Apple Watch 1.0 in quote early 2015, we're going to form pretty firm opinions
[1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:25.480]  of Kevin Lynch as an Apple product manager right off the bat.
[1:00:25.480 --> 1:00:31.360]  But Lynch was hired into an Apple where, you know, he could be told point blank, and
[1:00:31.360 --> 1:00:35.440]  I'm sure was this is how we work now, we collaborate, you know, and I think that's why
[1:00:35.440 --> 1:00:38.840]  you see, you know, that, you know, Shiller is already wearing an Apple Watch, Eddie Hughes
[1:00:38.840 --> 1:00:44.080]  wearing an Apple Watch, Federigis wearing an Apple Watch, you know, that they're not
[1:00:44.080 --> 1:00:49.040]  locked out of that in the way that I think a lot of people were with the iPhone before
[1:00:49.040 --> 1:00:50.040]  it came out.
[1:00:50.040 --> 1:00:53.960]  I mean, and the other thing that I've heard really good things about Kevin Lynch's work
[1:00:53.960 --> 1:00:58.600]  at Apple, like he sounds like he's doing a great job, but also while the Watch stuff
[1:00:58.600 --> 1:01:02.800]  is separate, for example, like, I don't know this for a fact, but it sounds to me like
[1:01:02.800 --> 1:01:05.800]  the message is not being like, if you're working on watch messages, you're not a lot
[1:01:05.800 --> 1:01:09.640]  to talk to the guy working on iOS or Mac messages, it sounds like that's not the case that
[1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:13.440]  the messages group, you know, spans across from that, which is what you want because otherwise
[1:01:13.440 --> 1:01:15.280]  it's going to create a broken experience.
[1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:20.520]  Yeah, I do, I think that's absolutely the case where he, you know, it might be separate
[1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:25.840]  from Federigis stuff, but in a sense, it's not because it's Federigis entrusted with
[1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:29.120]  it or he's not part of it, but that he's already got enough on his plate and they need,
[1:01:29.120 --> 1:01:33.840]  this is such a big undertaking that it needs its own point person and team, but they're
[1:01:33.840 --> 1:01:38.800]  not, I think the difference is maybe, maybe the word is, thief them, you know, that iOS
[1:01:38.800 --> 1:01:43.520]  was run by Scott Forstall as his own thief them within the company and that's not the
[1:01:43.520 --> 1:01:45.400]  case with the watch.
[1:01:45.400 --> 1:01:49.160]  And I was talking to Brett else about this last week, but you look at the design cues of
[1:01:49.160 --> 1:01:52.600]  the watch and you start to, you know, it's not just a copy of iOS seven or a copy of
[1:01:52.600 --> 1:01:53.600]  Yosemite.
[1:01:53.600 --> 1:01:57.440]  It is, it is being given the room to be its own thing, sort of established its own identity
[1:01:57.440 --> 1:01:58.440]  as well.
[1:01:58.440 --> 1:02:02.400]  Yeah, I almost get the sense that it, if there's anything that holds up as an analogy,
[1:02:02.400 --> 1:02:10.760]  it's almost like the watch OS is to iOS, what iOS was to Mac OS, yeah, you know, that,
[1:02:10.760 --> 1:02:15.040]  yes, we're not throwing everything out the kernel, it might be the exact same kernel.
[1:02:15.040 --> 1:02:21.160]  It's their, it might be a UI kit that's doing drawing.
[1:02:21.160 --> 1:02:23.440]  It runs from port like the iPhone runs from port.
[1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:25.240]  Right.
[1:02:25.240 --> 1:02:29.120]  But that it's, it's just about base, you know, using the technology that makes sense
[1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:37.800]  to reuse, but, but stripping it down to a level that's appropriate for this new dramatically
[1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:39.960]  lesser form factor.
[1:02:39.960 --> 1:02:48.440]  But the, the strategic aspects of how the software runs couldn't be more different from
[1:02:48.440 --> 1:02:54.200]  the original iPhone, where the original iPhone only had this tangential relationship
[1:02:54.200 --> 1:03:02.960]  with your Mac, which was connect a 30 pin connector and a USB cord to the two and hit
[1:03:02.960 --> 1:03:10.080]  them, you know, sync and wait and have, you know, I still think it's almost seems prehistoric.
[1:03:10.080 --> 1:03:13.640]  It can't believe it's only seven years ago, but that's the only way you got calendar events
[1:03:13.640 --> 1:03:18.240]  under your phone or back to your Mac if you created the event on your phone, that's the
[1:03:18.240 --> 1:03:24.480]  only way you could sync calendar events, the only way you could sync contacts.
[1:03:24.480 --> 1:03:28.560]  It's crazy that you only had to do all that tethered, but then once you untethered, your
[1:03:28.560 --> 1:03:35.080]  phone was a completely, iPhone was a completely independent device that had to do everything.
[1:03:35.080 --> 1:03:39.200]  Any kind of computation was done on the CPU on the phone, all of the drawing was done
[1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:41.320]  on the GPU on the phone.
[1:03:41.320 --> 1:03:47.560]  And the watch, at least for third party software is largely just a projected screen, where
[1:03:47.560 --> 1:03:50.040]  it's doing the least work possible.
[1:03:50.040 --> 1:03:55.040]  It's almost like the web app solution for the original iPhone, where when you no longer
[1:03:55.040 --> 1:03:57.920]  connected to the internet, nothing can update, when you're not, when your phone's no longer
[1:03:57.920 --> 1:03:59.560]  in vicinity, nothing can update.
[1:03:59.560 --> 1:04:00.560]  Right.
[1:04:00.560 --> 1:04:01.760]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:04:01.760 --> 1:04:07.120]  Let's take a break and we'll come back and talk more Yosemite.
[1:04:07.120 --> 1:04:11.800]  But I want to thank our second sponsor, and it's another long time friend of the show,
[1:04:11.800 --> 1:04:17.880]  our good friends at Linda.com, LYNDA.com.
[1:04:17.880 --> 1:04:25.000]  Linda.com is an easy and affordable way to help you learn, learn what, well, just about
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:34.320]  anything, from programming to photography to design to audio editing, even stuff like negotiation
[1:04:34.320 --> 1:04:35.320]  skills.
[1:04:35.320 --> 1:04:36.640]  They have classes on that.
[1:04:36.640 --> 1:04:39.600]  It's amazing the breadth of their library.
[1:04:39.600 --> 1:04:44.440]  You instantly stream thousands of courses created by experts on software, web development,
[1:04:44.440 --> 1:04:48.960]  gravity design, any of those things, and watch them right on your computer.
[1:04:48.960 --> 1:04:52.760]  Fresh content, there's new courses added daily.
[1:04:52.760 --> 1:04:56.840]  They work directly with industry experts and software companies to provide timely training,
[1:04:56.840 --> 1:05:01.520]  often the same day that new versions or releases of apps or products or services hit
[1:05:01.520 --> 1:05:03.200]  the market.
[1:05:03.200 --> 1:05:06.080]  So if you want to learn something new, new version of Lightroom comes out, guess what?
[1:05:06.080 --> 1:05:10.440]  You can learn everything that's new from Linda.com right away.
[1:05:10.440 --> 1:05:11.440]  Easy to learn.
[1:05:11.440 --> 1:05:14.520]  High quality, easy to follow.
[1:05:14.520 --> 1:05:19.520]  Their video tutorials are produced at the highest quality courses are broken down in the
[1:05:19.520 --> 1:05:25.080]  bite size pieces so you can learn at your own pace and learn from start to finish or just
[1:05:25.080 --> 1:05:27.040]  find a quick answer.
[1:05:27.040 --> 1:05:31.840]  They have beginning level stuff, mid level stuff, and expert level courses.
[1:05:31.840 --> 1:05:37.960]  They have great, great tools including searchable transcripts, super, super important.
[1:05:37.960 --> 1:05:41.200]  If you're looking back to find something that you knew you saw a couple of weeks ago in
[1:05:41.200 --> 1:05:44.840]  a course and you can't find it and you know what it is, you want to search for it while
[1:05:44.840 --> 1:05:47.560]  they've got it because all of their stuff has transcripts.
[1:05:47.560 --> 1:05:52.280]  You can make playlists and they even have stuff like certificate so that when you finish
[1:05:52.280 --> 1:05:59.280]  a course you can publish in your LinkedIn profile a certificate of which Linda.com courses
[1:05:59.280 --> 1:06:01.680]  you've completed.
[1:06:01.680 --> 1:06:07.200]  They have mobile apps so you can learn on a go with your iPhone, iPad, even Android.
[1:06:07.200 --> 1:06:14.080]  And if you get a premium account you can download the courses to your mobile device like
[1:06:14.080 --> 1:06:19.120]  your iPad, your iPhone, and watch them offline.
[1:06:19.120 --> 1:06:24.160]  Premium plan members can also download project files and practice along with the instructor.
[1:06:24.160 --> 1:06:25.160]  So how do you get all this?
[1:06:25.160 --> 1:06:30.120]  You pay for it by the video, nope, one low monthly price.
[1:06:30.120 --> 1:06:37.720]  You pay 25 bucks per month and that gives you unlimited access to over 100,000 video tutorials.
[1:06:37.720 --> 1:06:43.680]  The whole library, you pay 25 bucks a month, you get everything.
[1:06:43.680 --> 1:06:48.360]  Now you might be thinking well 25 bucks a month, that's actually not cheap, that's a
[1:06:48.360 --> 1:06:50.160]  lot of money.
[1:06:50.160 --> 1:06:53.720]  Here's how confident Linda.com is in their service.
[1:06:53.720 --> 1:06:57.680]  They have a special deal just for listeners of the show.

[1:07:34.880 --> 1:07:38.600]  say good enough just how high quality lynda.com's material is.
[1:07:38.600 --> 1:07:45.840]  So my thanks to them and check them out at lynda.com slash the talk show.
[1:07:45.840 --> 1:07:47.960]  Do you still have any machines that are running Mavericks?
[1:07:47.960 --> 1:07:53.720]  I don't, I waited a year to upgrade from mountain line to Mavericks on my podcast machine
[1:07:53.720 --> 1:07:57.920]  and I think I lasted a month before putting Yosemite on it.
[1:07:57.920 --> 1:08:04.440]  I still have the the air that I used to record these shows, like I'm recording right
[1:08:04.440 --> 1:08:07.240]  now using my old MacBook Air.
[1:08:07.240 --> 1:08:14.480]  Real runs the latest version of Mavericks and it's funny how it feels to me like it's
[1:08:14.480 --> 1:08:15.480]  years old.
[1:08:15.480 --> 1:08:16.480]  Yeah.
[1:08:16.480 --> 1:08:19.640]  Like I can't, I was just thinking before we started recording and thinking about the, you
[1:08:19.640 --> 1:08:22.600]  know, year old, I was like, I wonder how long, how long, how long, how how did date am I?
[1:08:22.600 --> 1:08:27.440]  And then I realized I'm really only like, it's still only like two months, how did date,
[1:08:27.440 --> 1:08:29.480]  but it looks ancient to my eyes.
[1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:33.320]  Just the wallpaper, when you see the Mavericks wallpaper, it feels like a bike on era.
[1:08:33.320 --> 1:08:34.960]  Yeah, I think so.
[1:08:34.960 --> 1:08:40.640]  But it's the, to me, it's the fonts, you know, and the heaviness of the buttons.
[1:08:40.640 --> 1:08:44.680]  It's, yeah, it's, it's a much heavier, more dower experience and that's probably why I
[1:08:44.680 --> 1:08:45.680]  upgraded.
[1:08:45.680 --> 1:08:50.200]  I just, I would look at it when I'd podcast and it would just look wrong to me.
[1:08:50.200 --> 1:08:52.960]  And it was a visuals, I think more than anything else that encouraged me to upgrade.
[1:08:52.960 --> 1:08:56.960]  Yeah, I think I over the holiday break, I'm going to upgrade this machine to a dad can't
[1:08:56.960 --> 1:08:59.800]  think of a good reason to keep on around anymore, either.
[1:08:59.800 --> 1:09:04.400]  There's nothing, you know, it's really just out of laziness and the fact that I don't
[1:09:04.400 --> 1:09:07.400]  use this machine for much anymore.
[1:09:07.400 --> 1:09:12.680]  It just happens to be all set up with the, you know, software I used to record the shows.
[1:09:12.680 --> 1:09:17.920]  And so it's sort of like, and if it ain't broke, don't fix it situation.
[1:09:17.920 --> 1:09:21.080]  But it, just staring at it, it just looks ugly.
[1:09:21.080 --> 1:09:25.480]  And I got the retina 5K iMac after the event, I just couldn't un, unsee it.
[1:09:25.480 --> 1:09:31.440]  And you know, that shipped with, I shipped with, you know, somebody, yeah, and I was
[1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:32.440]  just all in.
[1:09:32.440 --> 1:09:33.440]  Yeah.
[1:09:33.440 --> 1:09:39.440]  Um, I've also grown to be completely, I don't, I wouldn't quite say in love, but I'm
[1:09:39.440 --> 1:09:45.360]  completely accustomed to the, the system version of Helvetic and Neuya as the system
[1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:47.360]  fun.
[1:09:47.360 --> 1:09:50.800]  It's, it looks so good on a retina, we were arguing the other day whether it, you would
[1:09:50.800 --> 1:09:54.880]  prefer to have something like San Francisco or the mythical Apple songs if, if they ever
[1:09:54.880 --> 1:09:58.960]  shipped it, but they, they did a really great job of putting Helvetic and Neuya on, on
[1:09:58.960 --> 1:09:59.960]  the Mac.
[1:09:59.960 --> 1:10:02.480]  Do you have any idea whether San Francisco is Apple sand?
[1:10:02.480 --> 1:10:05.320]  I've heard that it isn't, I don't know if that's true or not, because I haven't heard
[1:10:05.320 --> 1:10:08.600]  it from a lot of people, but I heard an offhand comment that it wasn't.
[1:10:08.600 --> 1:10:12.640]  I wouldn't be surprised if it's not, but I have no, no idea, like the little birdies
[1:10:12.640 --> 1:10:16.320]  that told me about Apple sands and the little birdies that told me about San Francisco.
[1:10:16.320 --> 1:10:20.240]  Well, they didn't really tell me about it, they didn't know about it in advance, but, uh,
[1:10:20.240 --> 1:10:25.200]  but that told me that internally they were calling it, didn't vetica, but nobody's told
[1:10:25.200 --> 1:10:28.360]  me whether they're one and the same, and I can't help but think that they're not the
[1:10:28.360 --> 1:10:29.360]  same.
[1:10:29.360 --> 1:10:30.360]  Yeah.
[1:10:30.360 --> 1:10:33.240]  It's almost like reading smoke signals, and it could just mean that this is an optimized
[1:10:33.240 --> 1:10:36.360]  version of Apple sands for the watch, and that's why they're considered different, but
[1:10:36.360 --> 1:10:37.920]  it struck me that they were different.
[1:10:37.920 --> 1:10:38.920]  Yeah.
[1:10:38.920 --> 1:10:43.600]  The thing I've found playing with San Francisco is that it really only looks good, very,
[1:10:43.600 --> 1:10:44.600]  very small.
[1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:45.600]  Yeah.
[1:10:45.600 --> 1:10:50.760]  I mean, and from my hands on time, you know, months ago at the Apple watch event, I thought
[1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:57.200]  it looked fantastic up close, like just really, really look good.
[1:10:57.200 --> 1:11:00.800]  Looking with it on my Mac now that we have the SDK, it doesn't really look good to me
[1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:03.200]  at the sizes that I use fonts on the Mac.
[1:11:03.200 --> 1:11:04.200]  Yeah.
[1:11:04.200 --> 1:11:05.200]  It's not optimized.
[1:11:05.200 --> 1:11:06.200]  Right.
[1:11:06.200 --> 1:11:10.360]  And I tried the, I think I mentioned this a few shows ago, but I tried, there's like a GitHub
[1:11:10.360 --> 1:11:16.160]  thing with a hacked versions of San Francisco that have metadata set that make it look
[1:11:16.160 --> 1:11:18.920]  like they tell the system, it's the system fun.
[1:11:18.920 --> 1:11:23.040]  And if you put them in, I don't recommend anybody try this because it's, you know, hacking
[1:11:23.040 --> 1:11:26.040]  with your system that you're on your own, but more or less what you do is you put these
[1:11:26.040 --> 1:11:27.040]  hacked versions.
[1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:32.640]  And also it's, you know, like a copyright violation in a direct violation of the terms
[1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:37.080]  of the SDK download that you do not allow to diddle with the San Francisco font.
[1:11:37.080 --> 1:11:40.360]  And you're expressly not allowed to use it for anything other than developing watch
[1:11:40.360 --> 1:11:42.120]  kit apps.
[1:11:42.120 --> 1:11:47.320]  But what you could do is go to find this project on GitHub, download these versions of the
[1:11:47.320 --> 1:11:49.400]  fonts, which are different from Apple's versions.
[1:11:49.400 --> 1:11:52.800]  There's some kind of metadata that's set that tells the system, hey, this is the system
[1:11:52.800 --> 1:12:02.480]  fun, you put them in a slash library or, yeah, slash library fonts slash library slash
[1:12:02.480 --> 1:12:10.000]  fonts, and you can't put them in your user fonts file, not, you know, users, your name
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:13.840]  library fonts because the system won't look there for system fonts.
[1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:17.920]  The system looks first in slash system library fonts.
[1:12:17.920 --> 1:12:20.720]  And that's your Helvetica system fun is still there.
[1:12:20.720 --> 1:12:23.600]  You're not replacing it, you're not deleting it, you're not renaming it, you're not moving
[1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:24.600]  it.
[1:12:24.600 --> 1:12:28.000]  But then the system will look in slash library fonts, and if it finds another system
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:29.840]  font there, we'll use that one instead.
[1:12:29.840 --> 1:12:36.480]  So you just put these font files there, log out, log back in, and you'll semi, you know,
[1:12:36.480 --> 1:12:41.440]  we'll draw as with the system font, it'll use San Francisco.
[1:12:41.440 --> 1:12:44.280]  So I tried it just to see what it was like.
[1:12:44.280 --> 1:12:49.000]  And it's, it doesn't work, it gets, it's not that it doesn't work like it's broken and
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:55.520]  you know, it's, you know, a technical failure, just aesthetically, it's just kind of not
[1:12:55.520 --> 1:12:56.520]  right.
[1:12:56.520 --> 1:12:59.760]  Which is interesting, because I didn't think I'd like Helvetica on the Mac as much as I did,
[1:12:59.760 --> 1:13:05.680]  but then after the Apple TV update, which came much after, much after WC, and now I'm seeing
[1:13:05.680 --> 1:13:09.760]  Helvetica on my Apple TV, that is much more, every time I see it, I get a little reaction
[1:13:09.760 --> 1:13:10.760]  to it.
[1:13:10.760 --> 1:13:11.760]  Yeah.
[1:13:11.760 --> 1:13:16.720]  And it feels, it's somehow crazy to me how Apple has made it a font that is available
[1:13:16.720 --> 1:13:20.560]  to everyone anywhere, feel like they own it.
[1:13:20.560 --> 1:13:21.560]  Yeah.
[1:13:21.560 --> 1:13:24.880]  And it just, when they use it, it's, it's such an established font, it's such a classic
[1:13:24.880 --> 1:13:27.480]  unit, it feels so modern in the way they're using it.
[1:13:27.480 --> 1:13:28.640]  Yeah.
[1:13:28.640 --> 1:13:33.480]  But I don't think at San Francisco to me, it's, it's completely designed, I think, for
[1:13:33.480 --> 1:13:38.720]  the watch, and it's meant to be used at watch like sizes, which are physically very, very
[1:13:38.720 --> 1:13:39.720]  small.
[1:13:39.720 --> 1:13:40.720]  Yeah.
[1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:43.560]  Like the biggest you're ever going to see text on your Apple watch is a pretty small
[1:13:43.560 --> 1:13:45.600]  size.
[1:13:45.600 --> 1:13:46.600]  It's sort of in context.
[1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:50.320]  Like I know you've spoken with us on previous shows with the vibrancy, and you know, some
[1:13:50.320 --> 1:13:54.120]  people turn it off, but I've even gotten used to that, I've gotten used to seeing areas
[1:13:54.120 --> 1:13:58.640]  of red or black or things, and it, it just, I don't buy the argument that it brings
[1:13:58.640 --> 1:14:02.840]  a desktop through, but it does sort of, of make the whole system seem more alive.
[1:14:02.840 --> 1:14:03.840]  Yeah.
[1:14:03.840 --> 1:14:07.640]  But I was no doubt that like Syracuse has mentioned several times, there's no doubt that
[1:14:07.640 --> 1:14:11.640]  that's going to get toned down next year and a year after, you know, that they start out
[1:14:11.640 --> 1:14:18.240]  with taking an idea to the maximal level, and then over the years dial it back to where
[1:14:18.240 --> 1:14:19.240]  it should be.
[1:14:19.240 --> 1:14:24.840]  But they, you know, Apple is it as a company tends to err on the side of taking an idea
[1:14:24.840 --> 1:14:27.240]  too far, then taking, not taking it far enough.
[1:14:27.240 --> 1:14:28.240]  Yeah.
[1:14:28.240 --> 1:14:30.840]  And it's also they're very, for a giant company, they have, they have a lot of respect
[1:14:30.840 --> 1:14:34.520]  for the singular designer vision, like the person who designed Yosemite had a lot of ideas
[1:14:34.520 --> 1:14:37.440]  and those ideas, not all of them made it through, but a lot of them did.
[1:14:37.440 --> 1:14:41.040]  And a lot of companies, it would have fallen to design by committee very quickly.
[1:14:41.040 --> 1:14:42.040]  Yeah.
[1:14:42.040 --> 1:14:49.640]  Um, so I think overall Yosemite has been a pretty, pretty strong success.
[1:14:49.640 --> 1:14:50.640]  Yeah.
[1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:51.640]  Agreed completely.
[1:14:51.640 --> 1:14:56.200]  And for all the bugs that iOS 8 had and, you know, hit so many people, I think I, I think
[1:14:56.200 --> 1:15:01.800]  Yosemite has been pretty stable and, and, you know, deserves a pause right from the
[1:15:01.800 --> 1:15:07.000]  get-go for, for being pretty trouble free if you were an early adopter.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:10.680]  They had a couple Wi-Fi patch and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth seemed to be something that just affects
[1:15:10.680 --> 1:15:13.040]  some percentage of people every time.
[1:15:13.040 --> 1:15:16.520]  They had some security things, uh, even today, they've patched it with things yesterday.
[1:15:16.520 --> 1:15:20.000]  They're, they're patching security now faster than they ever done before.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  Yeah.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:24.200]  It's, it's really a new age and, in, at least a delivery of max software.
[1:15:24.200 --> 1:15:25.200]  Yeah.
[1:15:25.200 --> 1:15:29.640]  Today, as we record, we're recording on December 23rd and, uh, it might have rolled out,
[1:15:29.640 --> 1:15:34.040]  I think it rolled out last night, at least on US time, but within the 24 hours that we're
[1:15:34.040 --> 1:15:39.440]  recording as, as we speak, there was a bug fix that Apple rolled out that for the first
[1:15:39.440 --> 1:15:46.800]  time ever, they pushed to, uh, at least in Yosemite, I don't know if Mavericks got the push.
[1:15:46.800 --> 1:15:50.320]  But if you're running Yosemite, I got the notification like when I logged in this morning,
[1:15:50.320 --> 1:15:52.960]  it just said a security update was applied.
[1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:53.960]  Yeah.
[1:15:53.960 --> 1:15:54.960]  And that's it.
[1:15:54.960 --> 1:15:59.840]  It's like, you know, and I, you know, it's a lot of pressure for them because if they
[1:15:59.840 --> 1:16:06.320]  ever pushed one of those that did break things, it's, it's, it's going to be, you know,
[1:16:06.320 --> 1:16:07.320]  quite a scandal.
[1:16:07.320 --> 1:16:08.320]  Yeah.
[1:16:08.320 --> 1:16:09.320]  Yeah.
[1:16:09.320 --> 1:16:10.320]  No.
[1:16:10.320 --> 1:16:11.320]  No.
[1:16:11.320 --> 1:16:12.320]  No.
[1:16:12.320 --> 1:16:13.320]  No.
[1:16:13.320 --> 1:16:14.320]  No.
[1:16:14.320 --> 1:16:15.320]  No.
[1:16:15.320 --> 1:16:16.320]  No.
[1:16:16.320 --> 1:16:17.320]  No.
[1:16:17.320 --> 1:16:18.320]  No.
[1:16:18.320 --> 1:16:19.320]  No.
[1:16:19.320 --> 1:16:20.320]  No.
[1:16:20.320 --> 1:16:21.320]  No.
[1:16:21.320 --> 1:16:22.320]  No.
[1:16:22.320 --> 1:16:23.320]  No.
[1:16:23.320 --> 1:16:24.320]  No.
[1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:25.320]  No.
[1:16:25.320 --> 1:16:26.320]  No.
[1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:27.320]  It does seem like they're getting faster.
[1:16:27.320 --> 1:16:31.680]  Um, I can't help but think that with the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, that it must, it must just be that
[1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:38.320]  the matrix of how many different Wi-Fi chip sets there are in all the supported Macs
[1:16:38.320 --> 1:16:45.320]  that run Yosemite multiplied by all the various chip sets in the Wi-Fi routers out in a real
[1:16:45.320 --> 1:16:53.560]  world is just, it's just a testing nightmare, like, you know, you know, it's almost, we're
[1:16:53.560 --> 1:16:58.320]  almost lucky that it works at all because it just happens over and over and over again.
[1:16:58.320 --> 1:17:01.360]  I just run all Apple stuff and I've never had a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth bomb.
[1:17:01.360 --> 1:17:04.200]  I imagine when you, like you said, if you have every single vendor in there and every single
[1:17:04.200 --> 1:17:07.520]  variant, you're going to, you're going to hit whatever bugs are in both those stocks fairly
[1:17:07.520 --> 1:17:08.520]  often.
[1:17:08.520 --> 1:17:09.520]  Yeah.
[1:17:09.520 --> 1:17:13.800]  I have Apple router downstairs, I think it's the latest, whatever extreme.
[1:17:13.800 --> 1:17:18.960]  I don't know what they call it anymore, but the one that's tall, um, and to have for years
[1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:23.640]  and I've never been hit with those problems either because I'm surely, you know, every
[1:17:23.640 --> 1:17:30.560]  single standard Apple Wi-Fi chip set in a Mac does get tested against Apple zone routers.
[1:17:30.560 --> 1:17:31.560]  Yeah.
[1:17:31.560 --> 1:17:32.560]  I think they're first in line.
[1:17:32.560 --> 1:17:33.720]  Right.
[1:17:33.720 --> 1:17:40.240]  Um, and I think that Max or, I mean, you see bugs with iOS and Wi-Fi too, but I do think
[1:17:40.240 --> 1:17:43.120]  it seems to hit the Mac more and I can't help but think it's because the Mac hardware
[1:17:43.120 --> 1:17:45.800]  is not as unified as, as iOS hardware.
[1:17:45.800 --> 1:17:48.920]  I think iPad Air 2 is the first iPad where we didn't see a bunch of people complaining
[1:17:48.920 --> 1:17:52.120]  about Wi-Fi as soon as it launched.
[1:17:52.120 --> 1:17:53.120]  Yeah.
[1:17:53.120 --> 1:17:58.040]  I get the feeling that like supporting Wi-Fi at the driver level is, you know, sort of
[1:17:58.040 --> 1:18:03.880]  like supporting IMAP when you're writing a mail client, which it meaning that every single
[1:18:03.880 --> 1:18:08.600]  IMAP server has like a different interpretation of the IMAP spec at some level.
[1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:09.600]  Yeah.
[1:18:09.600 --> 1:18:15.320]  Like there's no way to just write a generic IMAP client, every IMAP client that gains
[1:18:15.320 --> 1:18:20.320]  any popularity because it hasn't, you know, it's actually useful effectively as, you
[1:18:20.320 --> 1:18:26.600]  know, it, you know, I'm server by server list of exceptions and stuff like that.
[1:18:26.600 --> 1:18:30.800]  Which was the big complaint about mail and Mavericks, especially with Gmail's eccentric
[1:18:30.800 --> 1:18:34.560]  to use a polite word IMAP implementation and now with Yosemite, you don't hear that very much
[1:18:34.560 --> 1:18:35.560]  anymore either.
[1:18:35.560 --> 1:18:36.560]  No, you don't.
[1:18:36.560 --> 1:18:41.200]  I think it's, I think they've cleaned that up pretty well.
[1:18:41.200 --> 1:18:42.360]  Where are we at in a calendar year?
[1:18:42.360 --> 1:18:46.000]  I think we're heading towards the iPhone 6 and 6 plus event.
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:47.560]  Yeah.
[1:18:47.560 --> 1:18:50.280]  Which was also the debut of the watch.
[1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:51.280]  Yeah.
[1:18:51.280 --> 1:18:53.600]  Big and bigger and then small.
[1:18:53.600 --> 1:18:55.080]  Right.
[1:18:55.080 --> 1:18:56.480]  And Apple Pay.
[1:18:56.480 --> 1:18:57.480]  Yeah.
[1:18:57.480 --> 1:19:01.040]  And in the demo area, I mean, they had, the iPhones laid out, they had the, they had
[1:19:01.040 --> 1:19:04.720]  the Apple watch laid out and then they had a whole area where you could go and see
[1:19:04.720 --> 1:19:09.280]  Apple Pay both in the app and at a simulated checkout station.
[1:19:09.280 --> 1:19:10.280]  Yeah.
[1:19:10.280 --> 1:19:17.860]  And I do think that's a good example of how, how difficult this, you know, and broads
[1:19:17.860 --> 1:19:23.320]  broke strokes, how difficult Apple and, you know, anybody else who's in the industry, but
[1:19:23.320 --> 1:19:29.840]  how it's not a month to month year to year game, it's a decade long game, because even
[1:19:29.840 --> 1:19:36.040]  with Apple Pay, you know, it's intertwined with the iPhone 6 because it's the iPhone 6 and
[1:19:36.040 --> 1:19:43.360]  6 plus or the only phones that work with Apple Pay, at least it retail terminals.
[1:19:43.360 --> 1:19:45.920]  And you know, you had to have touch ID first.
[1:19:45.920 --> 1:19:52.320]  So that was a year, that goes back a year ago to the iPhone 5 S. You had to have it and
[1:19:52.320 --> 1:19:54.040]  it had to work really well.
[1:19:54.040 --> 1:19:55.880]  So that starts a year ago.
[1:19:55.880 --> 1:20:01.960]  Now this year, you've got the two new phones that have NFC built in and the rollout in
[1:20:01.960 --> 1:20:09.000]  the retail stores of the terminals, you know, that accept it.
[1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:14.000]  But you're still talking about a service that only works two months in for people who've
[1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:18.320]  bought a brand new top of the line iPhone within the last two months, right?
[1:20:18.320 --> 1:20:24.680]  The real, the real Apple Play is two, three years ago, when 85% of active iPhone users
[1:20:24.680 --> 1:20:28.840]  are using something iPhone 6 or newer.
[1:20:28.840 --> 1:20:33.560]  It shows the patients that Apple has for some things and it shows how, for example, NFC
[1:20:33.560 --> 1:20:36.520]  to a lot of their competitors was just a chipset, they would just throw it in there,
[1:20:36.520 --> 1:20:39.400]  they didn't really care what you did with it, different manufacturers would do different
[1:20:39.400 --> 1:20:40.400]  things.
[1:20:40.400 --> 1:20:43.800]  Where Apple, there's no such thing as a chipset, it's a feature set and they experimented
[1:20:43.800 --> 1:20:47.000]  with NFC, they were prototypes with NFC for years and they just never shipped it because
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:49.080]  they didn't have a feature set that needed it.
[1:20:49.080 --> 1:20:54.040]  Not that it was a curiosity and might be a benefit, but actually needed it as a core technology
[1:20:54.040 --> 1:20:55.040]  in the phone.
[1:20:55.040 --> 1:20:57.160]  And when they did, they put NFC in and they shipped it.
[1:20:57.160 --> 1:20:59.240]  And it took until iPhone 6 for that to happen.
[1:20:59.240 --> 1:21:03.360]  But like you said, they had to have past book, they had to have touch ID to have all these
[1:21:03.360 --> 1:21:04.520]  things in place.
[1:21:04.520 --> 1:21:06.800]  And then when it made sense as a product, it gets shipped.
[1:21:06.800 --> 1:21:09.240]  Yeah, I've heard about NFC for iPhone.
[1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:16.080]  I think as far back as 2009, which was the year that the 3GS came out and that,
[1:21:16.080 --> 1:21:20.960]  I'm trying to think when that was, I heard that, I mean, it wouldn't have been right
[1:21:20.960 --> 1:21:26.320]  before, it would have been like seven or eight months before that it was a maybe for the
[1:21:26.320 --> 1:21:31.520]  next iPhone, you know, and clearly, you know, obviously did not happen.
[1:21:31.520 --> 1:21:33.880]  And I, you know, I think ultimately, you know, why not?
[1:21:33.880 --> 1:21:38.960]  And then again, it was a recurring thing, like 2009, maybe 2010, definitely maybe Apple
[1:21:38.960 --> 1:21:42.360]  was very, very interested in NFC.
[1:21:42.360 --> 1:21:45.320]  So that would have been the iPhone 4, you know, wasn't there.
[1:21:45.320 --> 1:21:49.880]  And I think it was always, you know, is that there was no story behind it, right?
[1:21:49.880 --> 1:21:54.680]  There's no, how, how was this actually going to be useful to people in the real world?
[1:21:54.680 --> 1:21:55.680]  Absolutely.
[1:21:55.680 --> 1:21:59.840]  I mean, they would prototype, but Apple prototypes almost anything that you can find a blog
[1:21:59.840 --> 1:22:04.240]  post about that makes even the slightest logical sense, Apple will prototype it.
[1:22:04.240 --> 1:22:07.640]  Like when they say max, make no sense for multi touch, it's not because they're just,
[1:22:07.640 --> 1:22:10.880]  you know, daydreaming or saying it for the sake of saying it is because they built it,
[1:22:10.880 --> 1:22:13.840]  they spent a lot of time trying it and they decided it wasn't an experience they want
[1:22:13.840 --> 1:22:14.840]  to ship.
[1:22:14.840 --> 1:22:17.480]  And it's in one day, maybe it will be in with NFC.
[1:22:17.480 --> 1:22:20.600]  It was in later stage prototypes for different phones and they're trying things and they're,
[1:22:20.600 --> 1:22:21.680]  like you said, no story.
[1:22:21.680 --> 1:22:22.680]  So it didn't ship.
[1:22:22.680 --> 1:22:26.080]  And then as soon as they had a really compelling story, which was Apple pay, that's in
[1:22:26.080 --> 1:22:27.400]  every phone we have now.
[1:22:27.400 --> 1:22:28.400]  Yeah.
[1:22:28.400 --> 1:22:34.320]  So tying it in, you know, the iPhone 6 announcement with this week's news, there's another
[1:22:34.320 --> 1:22:43.440]  rumor that came out of Asia, some analysts that Apple is considering a, a, a new four inch
[1:22:43.440 --> 1:22:45.520]  iPhone for next year.
[1:22:45.520 --> 1:22:46.520]  Did you see that?
[1:22:46.520 --> 1:22:47.520]  Yeah.
[1:22:47.520 --> 1:22:49.560]  I think Mac rumors had it.
[1:22:49.560 --> 1:22:51.920]  I think the name the guy came up with it was totally stupid.
[1:22:51.920 --> 1:22:54.800]  He called it the iPhone 6S mini.
[1:22:54.800 --> 1:22:55.800]  Yeah.
[1:22:55.800 --> 1:22:58.320]  Mitch called me 6S minus.
[1:22:58.320 --> 1:23:01.800]  I think the name would be, clearly it would be that iPhone 6C, right?
[1:23:01.800 --> 1:23:02.800]  Yep.
[1:23:02.800 --> 1:23:08.480]  I think it almost certainly would be the iPhone 6C and if not C, then air maybe.
[1:23:08.480 --> 1:23:13.040]  It's got to be 6S minus 6S and 6S plus.
[1:23:13.040 --> 1:23:14.040]  Use them.
[1:23:14.040 --> 1:23:16.440]  Just ride that math analogy into the ground.
[1:23:16.440 --> 1:23:17.440]  Minus.
[1:23:17.440 --> 1:23:21.000]  And they'd actually spell it out like am I in US?
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:24.760]  I think, again, I'm almost, you know, I can't say I'm positive, but I think it's very
[1:23:24.760 --> 1:23:28.600]  likely that Apple is prototyping four inch iPhones because they prototype tons of different
[1:23:28.600 --> 1:23:29.600]  sizes.
[1:23:29.600 --> 1:23:32.000]  What was interesting to me is I heard you say that on a previous show, it might have been
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:34.200]  two episodes ago or three episodes ago.
[1:23:34.200 --> 1:23:37.480]  And I was curious, you know, what Android people thought of that because their phones,
[1:23:37.480 --> 1:23:42.680]  I mean, their, their version of the HTC One Mini was I think, you know, five inches or something.
[1:23:42.680 --> 1:23:46.080]  And so I asked them, you know, is there a demand for four inch Android phones and I heard
[1:23:46.080 --> 1:23:50.600]  crickets, people said, no, 4.7 is the smallest we'd ever want.
[1:23:50.600 --> 1:23:52.680]  And to me that, that doesn't mean Apple should make one.
[1:23:52.680 --> 1:23:56.520]  That means there's probably a segment of the market that is totally underserved by the
[1:23:56.520 --> 1:24:01.160]  volume vendors and that there is opportunity for people who are distinguished or have very
[1:24:01.160 --> 1:24:04.680]  specific tastes and would enjoy iOS of that size.
[1:24:04.680 --> 1:24:05.680]  Yeah.
[1:24:05.680 --> 1:24:08.000]  The thing that makes, and this isn't based on this guy's reporting.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:12.160]  This is just my, I close my eyes and think about the way Apple thinks and the way Apple is
[1:24:12.160 --> 1:24:14.320]  acted over the last seven years.
[1:24:14.320 --> 1:24:19.880]  And I think it's probably true, but I also think that calling it the 6C, whether they
[1:24:19.880 --> 1:24:23.640]  call it that or not, tells you exactly what it's going to be, is I think it's going to
[1:24:23.640 --> 1:24:34.800]  be an A8, you know, this year's A8 and a camera like this year's camera.
[1:24:34.800 --> 1:24:38.920]  It's, you know, going to be effectively an iPhone 6 shrunk to four inches.
[1:24:38.920 --> 1:24:45.720]  Whereas the iPhone 6S and 6S plus, if they call them that, will get the A9 and they'll
[1:24:45.720 --> 1:24:52.080]  get a better camera and other, you know, whatever the 2015 technical improvements are.
[1:24:52.080 --> 1:24:57.160]  So that you'll be able to buy a four inch iPhone next year.
[1:24:57.160 --> 1:25:02.480]  And you'll have touch ID and you'll have Apple pay and you'll have an A8 and you'll have
[1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:04.480]  a camera like the one we have today.
[1:25:04.480 --> 1:25:08.880]  But if you want the top of the line, if you want the latest and greatest camera, if
[1:25:08.880 --> 1:25:13.800]  you want the latest and greatest system on a chip, you're still going to have to go 4.7
[1:25:13.800 --> 1:25:14.800]  or 5.5.
[1:25:14.800 --> 1:25:21.520]  Yeah, it makes a lot of sense with the same reasons, like because the iPhone 5C was always
[1:25:21.520 --> 1:25:24.800]  called the cheap iPhone and Apple never makes cheap products, but they wanted to make
[1:25:24.800 --> 1:25:25.800]  a popular iPhone.
[1:25:25.800 --> 1:25:29.040]  They wanted something that was sit on the shelves, not like a blockbuster movie, but like
[1:25:29.040 --> 1:25:31.600]  a TV show that just people could buy any time.
[1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:34.760]  But it also let them shove that down to the bottom of the line much faster.
[1:25:34.760 --> 1:25:36.720]  They wouldn't have to leave an iPhone 5 there.
[1:25:36.720 --> 1:25:41.200]  And the same logic makes sense for an iPhone 6C to be able to move that down the product
[1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:45.560]  line faster and make Apple pay more accessible to more people and to have it in more parts
[1:25:45.560 --> 1:25:46.880]  of their product line up.
[1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:52.920]  Yeah, and I think the other thing that they don't want is that third pricing tier that
[1:25:52.920 --> 1:25:53.920]  starts it.
[1:25:53.920 --> 1:25:54.920]  Because that's the other thing.
[1:25:54.920 --> 1:25:59.520]  If you do want a new four inch phone next year, I do, if I'm right, then it's going to be
[1:25:59.520 --> 1:26:03.720]  the 2014 technical stuff, the A8 and the camera, etc.
[1:26:03.720 --> 1:26:09.000]  The upside will be that you'll save money because I think it'll start at $99 on a contract.
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:13.720]  If it's off contract, it'll be $100 less than the six ass.
[1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:19.760]  Yeah, you have 4.7 at the $199 mark, the four inch just based on human behavior has to be
[1:26:19.760 --> 1:26:20.760]  cheaper.
[1:26:20.760 --> 1:26:26.000]  Yeah, the thing that I think they wanted to get away from is having that $99 tier.
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:32.280]  And I'm speaking in the subsidized terms, but the $99 tier look virtually identical
[1:26:32.280 --> 1:26:35.400]  to the $199 tier, right?
[1:26:35.400 --> 1:26:43.800]  That's what the five C did is they, you know, it had exactly the same tech specs almost
[1:26:43.800 --> 1:26:48.440]  to a T as the iPhone 5, but it looked different.
[1:26:48.440 --> 1:26:50.920]  And some people, you know, obviously some people thought it looked better.
[1:26:50.920 --> 1:26:54.760]  I know people who bought it because they wanted a colorful phone, but it's still, even
[1:26:54.760 --> 1:26:59.440]  if that's the case, then, you know, good for you, you saved $100.
[1:26:59.440 --> 1:27:06.480]  But I don't think Apple liked it, where up until the five C was introduced, the $99 option
[1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:11.160]  looked, or nearly identical, you know, there were obviously some certain tells that you
[1:27:11.160 --> 1:27:16.040]  could tell an iPhone 4 from a 4S, you know, the antenna bands where it's certainly different,
[1:27:16.040 --> 1:27:18.280]  it's slightly different points.
[1:27:18.280 --> 1:27:24.400]  And earlier, when they first started keeping the old phone around the 3G and the 3GS, you
[1:27:24.400 --> 1:27:29.000]  could tell them apart because the word iPhone on the back was written, yes, shiny letters
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:30.600]  instead of flat letters.
[1:27:30.600 --> 1:27:32.120]  Well, people want to show they have the new one, right?
[1:27:32.120 --> 1:27:34.200]  It's part of the esteem of having the new iPhone.
[1:27:34.200 --> 1:27:35.200]  Right.
[1:27:35.200 --> 1:27:39.800]  No, I totally think so, you know, and it's, and Apple wants to enable that.
[1:27:39.800 --> 1:27:46.840]  So that's why I think that, you know, I don't know if, I don't know if an iPhone 6C would
[1:27:46.840 --> 1:27:52.760]  be plastic, like the 5C, like I wouldn't be surprised if it's metal or it ended, you
[1:27:52.760 --> 1:27:55.800]  know, with rounded corners, like the 6S and 6 Plus.
[1:27:55.800 --> 1:27:59.640]  But just the size of it would tell you that it's, you know, the lesser model.
[1:27:59.640 --> 1:28:04.080]  Yeah, it was funny with the iPhone 5, even though Apple rebuilt it from the atoms on up,
[1:28:04.080 --> 1:28:07.200]  it was boring, but the minute they made it in gold, you know, people first made fun of it
[1:28:07.200 --> 1:28:09.800]  and then everyone complained they couldn't get one.
[1:28:09.800 --> 1:28:17.800]  Did you hear, you know, it's still hard to get an iPhone's.
[1:28:17.800 --> 1:28:21.640]  Yeah, I think there's, there's still, I didn't know that until I was listening to ATP and
[1:28:21.640 --> 1:28:28.160]  heard Syracuse talking about it, it's supply still hasn't caught up with demand.
[1:28:28.160 --> 1:28:32.160]  Milton has been trying to get them for weeks and I think yet the finally calling favors
[1:28:32.160 --> 1:28:36.200]  to try to get them shipped to that makes me laugh.
[1:28:36.200 --> 1:28:39.360]  Well, it's hilarious because people who leave Apple have no idea how to get a, like how
[1:28:39.360 --> 1:28:42.360]  normal people get their phones, like they just, they've never had to deal with carriers
[1:28:42.360 --> 1:28:46.400]  or with retail stores or, and it sounds like some of them, you know, as much as I love
[1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:50.640]  them, they're absolutely inadequate and equipped to deal with the horrors of retail shopping.
[1:28:50.640 --> 1:29:05.640]  Yeah, let me see here, if I get a six and I get it in space gray, I get it on Verizon.
[1:29:05.640 --> 1:29:12.240]  If I want, well, it looks like I can get, I can get 128 gigs as available three to five
[1:29:12.240 --> 1:29:13.240]  business days.
[1:29:13.240 --> 1:29:18.160]  I think the six plus is still harder than the six, yeah, but they're starting to fall into
[1:29:18.160 --> 1:29:22.800]  more about, which is great. I mean, as much as people complain about, about the iPhone,
[1:29:22.800 --> 1:29:26.160]  you still can't get them that there's their complete, their supply constraint from months
[1:29:26.160 --> 1:29:27.160]  after launch.
[1:29:27.160 --> 1:29:28.160]  Yeah.
[1:29:28.160 --> 1:29:30.160]  Which was crazy.
[1:29:30.160 --> 1:29:33.840]  Um, and I think that's, you know, but I still think that's pretty interesting that
[1:29:33.840 --> 1:29:39.360]  they're at a point where they still don't catch up in supply demand until after the
[1:29:39.360 --> 1:29:40.360]  holiday.
[1:29:40.360 --> 1:29:41.360]  Yeah.
[1:29:41.360 --> 1:29:43.680]  And a year after a year or two, it's not a diminishing thing.
[1:29:43.680 --> 1:29:45.760]  They're making more and more money off the iPhone.
[1:29:45.760 --> 1:29:47.160]  Yeah.
[1:29:47.160 --> 1:29:48.160]  That's left.
[1:29:48.160 --> 1:29:53.960]  I guess we have the last event of the year, which would be the iPad air to, yes, and,
[1:29:53.960 --> 1:29:56.160]  you know, somebody, oh, and the retina, I'm back.
[1:29:56.160 --> 1:29:57.160]  Yeah.
[1:29:57.160 --> 1:29:59.560]  Retina, I'm actually going to really sticks out to me.
[1:29:59.560 --> 1:30:01.160]  I still, I love the iPad air too.
[1:30:01.160 --> 1:30:06.240]  I still think, I think it's an amazing device, but it's, it's a refinement of the iPad
[1:30:06.240 --> 1:30:13.320]  air, whereas the, the retina five came back is to me like a new, a new era.
[1:30:13.320 --> 1:30:16.840]  The two things that are similar to me about those devices are that with the iPad air
[1:30:16.840 --> 1:30:21.760]  too, Apple started making their own GPUs in a like an antique first thought it was a six
[1:30:21.760 --> 1:30:27.200]  core, um, imagination, uh, chip, and they later realized that it was an eight core one,
[1:30:27.200 --> 1:30:29.880]  which it was totally theoretical until Apple made it.
[1:30:29.880 --> 1:30:31.080]  It wasn't just a design.
[1:30:31.080 --> 1:30:34.480]  They actually took the architecture and built their own custom GPU, and they've been doing
[1:30:34.480 --> 1:30:37.760]  CPU's for a couple of generations, like they had Swift and they had cyclone.
[1:30:37.760 --> 1:30:39.520]  Now they have cyclone too.
[1:30:39.520 --> 1:30:44.160]  But now they're doing the entire chip almost is, is in house at Apple.
[1:30:44.160 --> 1:30:48.640]  And then you look at the iMac and they made the timing controller for that.
[1:30:48.640 --> 1:30:53.040]  They made five K possible in that computer when Intel has not yet shipped Skylake or
[1:30:53.040 --> 1:30:54.360]  Thunderbolt three or anything.
[1:30:54.360 --> 1:30:58.640]  So they are, they're again, they're making more and more of the internals of their machines.
[1:30:58.640 --> 1:30:59.640]  Yeah.
[1:30:59.640 --> 1:31:03.760]  And that's interesting to me that they've done it for the iMac because they've, they've
[1:31:03.760 --> 1:31:09.960]  had this economy of scale with iOS devices because even as they've expanded the lineups
[1:31:09.960 --> 1:31:16.480]  and they've gone out of two iPhone sizes and, you know, there's two iPad sizes.
[1:31:16.480 --> 1:31:20.360]  And there are cellular and non cellular versions of the iPads.
[1:31:20.360 --> 1:31:24.360]  But for the most part, it's still at, in terms of what's actually new this year, it's
[1:31:24.360 --> 1:31:28.360]  a very limited number of SKUs, right?
[1:31:28.360 --> 1:31:34.160]  And, and they share a lot of stuff, you know, that the iPhone six and six plus are really,
[1:31:34.160 --> 1:31:38.400]  very, very, there's a slight difference in the camera where the, the six plus camera has
[1:31:38.400 --> 1:31:40.600]  optical image stabilization.
[1:31:40.600 --> 1:31:46.320]  So that's a different part, but it's the same A8 CPU and it's, you know, just the stuff
[1:31:46.320 --> 1:31:47.320]  that has to be different.
[1:31:47.320 --> 1:31:53.640]  It's different, you know, different display because it's different size and it's different
[1:31:53.640 --> 1:31:56.120]  pixels.
[1:31:56.120 --> 1:31:59.640]  But that they've, you know, they had this great economy of scale which lets them do these
[1:31:59.640 --> 1:32:04.600]  things like you're saying, like build their own systems on a chip and not share it with
[1:32:04.600 --> 1:32:07.360]  the rest of the, you know, have these things that aren't available to anybody else in
[1:32:07.360 --> 1:32:08.360]  the industry.
[1:32:08.360 --> 1:32:12.400]  It's interesting to me that they've done it with the iMac 2, which is clearly lower
[1:32:12.400 --> 1:32:13.400]  volume.
[1:32:13.400 --> 1:32:18.200]  I mean, without question, I mean, I think all iMacs together are just dropping the bucket
[1:32:18.200 --> 1:32:23.440]  volume wise compared to iPad or any iPhone or iPad model.
[1:32:23.440 --> 1:32:30.520]  But the retina one in particular, existing only at the top of the product, what do you
[1:32:30.520 --> 1:32:31.520]  call it?
[1:32:31.520 --> 1:32:32.520]  The product, the pyramid?
[1:32:32.520 --> 1:32:34.600]  Yeah, the pyramid, right?
[1:32:34.600 --> 1:32:38.280]  It's only the best option, the good and better ones are still non retina because of the
[1:32:38.280 --> 1:32:44.960]  retina display, you know, it's, it's this weird combination where it's, you know, in
[1:32:44.960 --> 1:32:50.840]  one sense, it's remarkably inexpensive because famously like Dell has a 5K display, didn't
[1:32:50.840 --> 1:32:52.120]  they come out of the 5K display?
[1:32:52.120 --> 1:32:57.240]  They, you know, they came out with a month or so ago, but it requires two display port connections.
[1:32:57.240 --> 1:33:00.960]  But it costs as much, it costs as much or more as the whole iMacs, right?
[1:33:00.960 --> 1:33:04.480]  So Dell came out with a 5K display where just the display and forget about where the
[1:33:04.480 --> 1:33:07.560]  you need, you know, how you're going to actually run it and that you need to display ports
[1:33:07.560 --> 1:33:09.240]  and all the, how are you going to get graphics cards?
[1:33:09.240 --> 1:33:11.400]  How are you going to get, how's everything going to work?
[1:33:11.400 --> 1:33:12.400]  Just forget about it.
[1:33:12.400 --> 1:33:17.760]  Just the display itself costs as much as the whole iMac, which includes a pretty killer
[1:33:17.760 --> 1:33:18.920]  computer.
[1:33:18.920 --> 1:33:19.920]  Yeah.
[1:33:19.920 --> 1:33:23.360]  And the crazy thing is Apple, if you asked me, you know, 10 years ago, you know, Apple's
[1:33:23.360 --> 1:33:24.360]  not a chip fab.
[1:33:24.360 --> 1:33:25.360]  They're not an Intel.
[1:33:25.360 --> 1:33:26.360]  They're not a TMCH.
[1:33:26.360 --> 1:33:28.920]  They're not anyone of these companies and they got to 64 bit first.
[1:33:28.920 --> 1:33:33.000]  And now they're, they're making chips that are just pushing the industry forward and they're
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:38.120]  not a peripheral maker, but they're with the original IPS iMac and now with the 5K iMac.
[1:33:38.120 --> 1:33:39.120]  They're making displays.
[1:33:39.120 --> 1:33:41.640]  That's just pushing the industry forward.
[1:33:41.640 --> 1:33:46.120]  The, the iPad Air 2 is so overpowered that you could arguably say, you know, guys, relax,
[1:33:46.120 --> 1:33:47.120]  stop.
[1:33:47.120 --> 1:33:50.360]  But instead of that, Apple's just saying, run, get as far ahead as fast as you can and just
[1:33:50.360 --> 1:33:54.320]  keep going, just push the state of this technology because it will filter down and we will
[1:33:54.320 --> 1:33:56.960]  figure out a way to make all this stuff super, super important.
[1:33:56.960 --> 1:33:59.080]  And to do things that nobody else can do.
[1:33:59.080 --> 1:34:07.120]  Yeah, and it's, it's turning the industry's model on its head where from the outset, from
[1:34:07.120 --> 1:34:13.920]  the very beginning of personal computing through recently, the model was that it's, you
[1:34:13.920 --> 1:34:21.240]  know, this commodity market where you buy CPUs from Intel, you buy graphics cards from
[1:34:21.240 --> 1:34:28.400]  and video or, you know, whoever else, Radeon, I guess, you know, but there'd be graphics
[1:34:28.400 --> 1:34:29.400]  companies.
[1:34:29.400 --> 1:34:35.240]  There'd be memory makers, you know, there'd be hard drive makers and you would just put
[1:34:35.240 --> 1:34:38.560]  all the, you know, if you wanted to make a computer, you'd pick and choose to get this
[1:34:38.560 --> 1:34:39.560]  salad bar.
[1:34:39.560 --> 1:34:40.560]  Right.
[1:34:40.560 --> 1:34:44.320]  I guess, yeah, it's totally like a salad bar, but everybody else could get them too.
[1:34:44.320 --> 1:34:49.160]  And you could make deals, and depending on your volume, I'm sure, you know, Dell and HP,
[1:34:49.160 --> 1:34:54.800]  as higher volume vendors would have some sort of leverage and priority versus, you know,
[1:34:54.800 --> 1:35:03.360]  a smaller by market share, PC maker, you know, but it was the, what you were possible,
[1:35:03.360 --> 1:35:08.760]  what was possible to do, though, was limited by these specialists.
[1:35:08.760 --> 1:35:16.240]  So if you wanted to drive a 5K display, you were limited unless you could get somebody
[1:35:16.240 --> 1:35:20.920]  out, you know, that less the state of the art in the graphics industry was a graphics card
[1:35:20.920 --> 1:35:28.960]  that could push that many pixels and a connector that could carry them, whereas Apple
[1:35:28.960 --> 1:35:32.680]  has started turning things like that on its head and it doesn't matter if the industry
[1:35:32.680 --> 1:35:33.680]  can't do it yet.
[1:35:33.680 --> 1:35:38.680]  The state of the art in the industry, they just made their own and made it work.
[1:35:38.680 --> 1:35:42.040]  And it's not available to anybody else.
[1:35:42.040 --> 1:35:45.160]  That's the, in like you said, like to do things that other people can't do.
[1:35:45.160 --> 1:35:46.160]  Yeah.
[1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:49.480]  Well, it goes back to your only Apple piece from WBC.
[1:35:49.480 --> 1:35:53.520]  Yeah, I think it's, you know, probably the best piece I wrote this year.
[1:35:53.520 --> 1:35:57.920]  I think it's the only one that, or at least the one that has the most stained value, even
[1:35:57.920 --> 1:36:01.480]  low these many months later, I think it's, it's, if anything, I underplayed it.
[1:36:01.480 --> 1:36:02.480]  Yeah.
[1:36:02.480 --> 1:36:03.480]  And I think it's true.
[1:36:03.480 --> 1:36:06.000]  And I think when we like next year, we already mentioned maybe there's a bigger iPad,
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:10.240]  but maybe there's software and services that go along with that and having two gigs and
[1:36:10.240 --> 1:36:15.440]  having an octa cord GPU makes a lot more sense, you know, next year than it makes this year.
[1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:19.120]  But it allows people who buy the brand new iPad Air this year to not feel left behind
[1:36:19.120 --> 1:36:22.080]  when the newer devices or newer software ships.
[1:36:22.080 --> 1:36:27.680]  And I, and I still keep thinking about 64 bit for mobile and, you know, nobody else has
[1:36:27.680 --> 1:36:28.680]  it yet.
[1:36:28.680 --> 1:36:31.880]  I mean, there's some chips that are possible capable of it out for Android, but it certainly
[1:36:31.880 --> 1:36:33.120]  is far from mainstream.
[1:36:33.120 --> 1:36:34.120]  Yeah.
[1:36:34.120 --> 1:36:36.960]  The Nexus 9, I think, ship with it just because they, they decided they had to have,
[1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:40.360]  they couldn't wait any longer to get 64 bit out the door.
[1:36:40.360 --> 1:36:43.280]  But it's not, it's not an arm, it's Intel, right?
[1:36:43.280 --> 1:36:47.680]  It's the Nexus 9, I think is X84, X86.
[1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:51.400]  I think, no, I think it's Qualcomm, but I'd have to double check.
[1:36:51.400 --> 1:36:52.400]  I don't know.
[1:36:52.400 --> 1:36:54.520]  But either way though, it certainly isn't like a mainstream thing.
[1:36:54.520 --> 1:36:58.160]  But to me, it's, it's 64 bit came out and people complained, oh, there's no four gigabytes
[1:36:58.160 --> 1:36:59.600]  of memory apples just wasting it.
[1:36:59.600 --> 1:37:03.040]  But it turns out that the ARM V8 instruction set was so much better.
[1:37:03.040 --> 1:37:06.520]  And the security that they could use enabled all the touch ID stuff, there was just so
[1:37:06.520 --> 1:37:11.360]  many other things about building that chipset that 64 bit was almost a bonus for them.
[1:37:11.360 --> 1:37:15.680]  The same way three cores on the iPhone six is almost a bonus and eight cores on the
[1:37:15.680 --> 1:37:16.680]  iPad Air too.
[1:37:16.680 --> 1:37:17.680]  They're doing it because they can.
[1:37:17.680 --> 1:37:18.680]  There's no reason not to.
[1:37:18.680 --> 1:37:20.080]  So why shouldn't we do it?
[1:37:20.080 --> 1:37:21.080]  Right.
[1:37:21.080 --> 1:37:24.920]  It just goes hand in hand with the new instruction set, which is really where the performance
[1:37:24.920 --> 1:37:25.920]  wins come from.
[1:37:25.920 --> 1:37:31.800]  Not the mat, not any sort of magical going from 32 to 64 on any hypothetical platform
[1:37:31.800 --> 1:37:33.680]  magically makes things better.
[1:37:33.680 --> 1:37:34.680]  It wasn't like that.
[1:37:34.680 --> 1:37:41.000]  It was a very, very practical, you know, the new ARM instruction set is way better.
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:45.120]  It gets sort of all sorts of legacy cruffed, you know, that dates back to the early
[1:37:45.120 --> 1:37:50.520]  days of ARM when it was powering things like the Newton and, you know, Palm Pilots and
[1:37:50.520 --> 1:37:51.520]  stuff like that.
[1:37:51.520 --> 1:37:52.520]  And I mean, great.
[1:37:52.520 --> 1:37:54.120]  It's just so many benefits.
[1:37:54.120 --> 1:37:55.120]  Right.
[1:37:55.120 --> 1:38:00.400]  And everything that the computer engineers have learned since then about how to make efficient,
[1:38:00.400 --> 1:38:06.800]  you know, instruction sets for computers and, you know, and what is it that a modern compiler
[1:38:06.800 --> 1:38:11.800]  wants to see in an instruction set to generate a fish and code?
[1:38:11.800 --> 1:38:17.760]  And it was, you know, rewritten from scratch with all this cruffed, gone, and all sorts
[1:38:17.760 --> 1:38:22.040]  of new stuff to help modern compilers, you know, in there.
[1:38:22.040 --> 1:38:26.680]  And here we are over a year later, and Apple is still the only mainstream, you know, device
[1:38:26.680 --> 1:38:27.680]  that has it.
[1:38:27.680 --> 1:38:29.240]  And we have Swift and we have Metal.
[1:38:29.240 --> 1:38:32.720]  So when you put those technologies all together, eventually the performance is going to
[1:38:32.720 --> 1:38:34.920]  be way beyond what just the hardware delivers.
[1:38:34.920 --> 1:38:35.920]  Yeah.
[1:38:35.920 --> 1:38:41.840]  And I think that those two things, you know, Swift is obviously new for 2014.
[1:38:41.840 --> 1:38:44.800]  Metal is new for 2014.
[1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:51.600]  And I think they get to the heart of like what, what, what, what is Apple going to be like
[1:38:51.600 --> 1:38:57.800]  as a big company with, with big weapons to swing around?
[1:38:57.800 --> 1:39:02.320]  And, you know, obviously, like I said, like the watch that the canary and the coal fund
[1:39:02.320 --> 1:39:05.880]  I'm looking for is hubris, you know, and obviously when a company gets bigger, it tries
[1:39:05.880 --> 1:39:06.880]  to do more on its own.
[1:39:06.880 --> 1:39:13.160]  I mean, Microsoft famously, you know, it does everything on its own, you know, their
[1:39:13.160 --> 1:39:16.840]  own, you know, they're the only company that you just backed, you know, just little details
[1:39:16.840 --> 1:39:23.440]  like that they use backslashes instead of slashes between directory paths to, you know,
[1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:29.480]  having had their own, you know, developer tool chain and their own programming language,
[1:39:29.480 --> 1:39:32.440]  you know, for, you know, but they've did more than that, though.
[1:39:32.440 --> 1:39:37.960]  I feel like when Microsoft was at its height, you know, in the 90s, you know, it was the
[1:39:37.960 --> 1:39:46.480]  fact that they expanded into things like co ownership of slate.com, the founding of MSNBC,
[1:39:46.480 --> 1:39:52.000]  you know, that they wanted to own a cable news like, right, why, why would Microsoft want
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:56.680]  to get involved in cable news, you know, but I feel like Apple as they try to do more
[1:39:56.680 --> 1:40:02.000]  and more on their own, it's only in the name of enabling features that would be better
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:04.360]  for the products that are already making, right?
[1:40:04.360 --> 1:40:07.640]  Like for enterprise, they didn't decide to create an enterprise company or buy an enterprise
[1:40:07.640 --> 1:40:08.640]  company.
[1:40:08.640 --> 1:40:10.840]  They partnered with IBM to let them do what they did well.
[1:40:10.840 --> 1:40:11.840]  Right.
[1:40:11.840 --> 1:40:17.200]  No, that's a great, it's a great example of that they didn't create this new enterprise
[1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:23.400]  division within Apple, which is outside their expertise and risks losing their focus, you
[1:40:23.400 --> 1:40:28.440]  know, if Tim Cook wants this, you know, wants to make a big bet and do this, he doesn't
[1:40:28.440 --> 1:40:33.320]  have to spend anywhere near as much attention on it as, you know, as he would in this
[1:40:33.320 --> 1:40:37.880]  world where they're willing to say, you know what, we just want our devices to be used
[1:40:37.880 --> 1:40:39.200]  in the enterprise.
[1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:43.680]  We'll let IBM handle how to make the sales and how to write these, you know, these apps
[1:40:43.680 --> 1:40:45.240]  that are meant for that market.
[1:40:45.240 --> 1:40:49.880]  So perfect example, yeah, much better than buying SAP or something that, you know, the imaginary
[1:40:49.880 --> 1:40:51.920]  people always want Apple to buy, right?
[1:40:51.920 --> 1:40:56.200]  And Swift, you know, is an example where they're not, they didn't create a new programming
[1:40:56.200 --> 1:40:59.400]  language to change computer science.
[1:40:59.400 --> 1:41:04.640]  It's not, you know, if anything, the critiques from people who are like programming language
[1:41:04.640 --> 1:41:07.760]  critics is that it's sort of a boring language.
[1:41:07.760 --> 1:41:10.080]  There's nothing outlandish about it.
[1:41:10.080 --> 1:41:13.760]  There's nothing novel about it.
[1:41:13.760 --> 1:41:18.960]  It's just a nice simple language, you know, in terms of not that there aren't clever things
[1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:25.880]  under the hood and like the fact that, you know, most of the language that's designed
[1:41:25.880 --> 1:41:29.160]  is defined in the runtime, not in the language itself.
[1:41:29.160 --> 1:41:31.160]  The language itself is super, super minimal.
[1:41:31.160 --> 1:41:33.480]  There's something, you know, artistic about that.
[1:41:33.480 --> 1:41:37.440]  But effectively, it's just what kind of programming language would you write?
[1:41:37.440 --> 1:41:43.240]  Would you want to enable the sort of software that Apple wants to run?
[1:41:43.240 --> 1:41:44.240]  That's it.
[1:41:44.240 --> 1:41:47.600]  It's just a very, very practical language.
[1:41:47.600 --> 1:41:53.480]  You know, and what would you get when you have a language that's led by the compiler guy,
[1:41:53.480 --> 1:41:54.480]  Chris Ladder.
[1:41:54.480 --> 1:41:57.440]  Or a company that lets the compiler guy lead a language.
[1:41:57.440 --> 1:41:58.440]  Right.
[1:41:58.440 --> 1:42:03.640]  But it's sort of the opposite of the sort of hoity-toity academic languages that, you know,
[1:42:03.640 --> 1:42:07.440]  the new programming languages that I remember when I was young and in college in the 90s
[1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:13.640]  where it was all led, it was, you know, the practical utility that was completely abstracted.
[1:42:13.640 --> 1:42:19.520]  It was all philosophical in terms of what was driving the decisions behind them.
[1:42:19.520 --> 1:42:23.480]  It's a language designed to be used by Apple and sooner rather than later.
[1:42:23.480 --> 1:42:25.240]  Yes, very much so.
[1:42:25.240 --> 1:42:31.800]  And very much designed, you know, as Syracuse has pointed out on ATP, it's we've already,
[1:42:31.800 --> 1:42:36.040]  one thing we've got that is not going to budge is we've already got these frameworks,
[1:42:36.040 --> 1:42:37.880]  the cocoa frameworks.
[1:42:37.880 --> 1:42:40.560]  And in theory, if they were going to start with all new frameworks, maybe they'd come
[1:42:40.560 --> 1:42:41.960]  up with all new language.
[1:42:41.960 --> 1:42:46.160]  But it's, we've got these frameworks that are, you know, have these, you know, that are
[1:42:46.160 --> 1:42:50.440]  already designed and already have these, these, you know, design patterns.
[1:42:50.440 --> 1:42:54.400]  What type of new language would we use that would best leverage them?
[1:42:54.400 --> 1:42:57.320]  And that's one of the things that I really like about the way that Apple is running now
[1:42:57.320 --> 1:42:59.840]  is they're not, they don't have to restart everything again.
[1:42:59.840 --> 1:43:05.560]  They can do something like add LLVM and add Swift and do these things that take them further
[1:43:05.560 --> 1:43:09.880]  without having to destroy or stop or played an artificial break between what they had before.
[1:43:09.880 --> 1:43:12.760]  It's like they're swapping the parts behind the scenes and if you're not paying attention,
[1:43:12.760 --> 1:43:16.240]  you might not even see it, but it gives them tremendous benefit over time.
[1:43:16.240 --> 1:43:17.240]  Yeah.
[1:43:17.240 --> 1:43:22.000]  In metal, likewise, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's the only, it's the sort of thing
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:25.680]  you can only do when you have a big user base.
[1:43:25.680 --> 1:43:30.280]  I mean, Microsoft famously has done that with the direct X, you know, where Mike, you
[1:43:30.280 --> 1:43:35.120]  know, it's, you know, sustained to this day that their leadership in PC gaming, you
[1:43:35.120 --> 1:43:41.720]  know, if that's probably no area of computing where they're stronger than PC gaming.
[1:43:41.720 --> 1:43:45.000]  And they're able to say, here's, you know, here's the graphics language you're going to
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:51.640]  use. And that's it. And they can do that because they've got the footprint. Apple couldn't
[1:43:51.640 --> 1:43:57.480]  do metal, you know, 10 years ago with the Mac. I mean, it's still not on the Mac, but
[1:43:57.480 --> 1:44:00.040]  they couldn't, and I don't think they could have, I don't think it would have really taken
[1:44:00.040 --> 1:44:07.320]  off in 2008 or 2009. They really needed that massive hundreds of millions of users base
[1:44:07.320 --> 1:44:13.920]  and this, you know, this de facto position is like the leading handheld gaming market.
[1:44:13.920 --> 1:44:20.080]  And now it's not like they're forcing it down developers' throats. They're, you know, you
[1:44:20.080 --> 1:44:23.840]  don't have to use it. It's not like they're, they've said like, oh, next year, if you
[1:44:23.840 --> 1:44:28.120]  don't use, if your game isn't using Swift, it won't be in the app store. It's something
[1:44:28.120 --> 1:44:34.240]  developers want to use though because, you know, it's, it gives them better performance
[1:44:34.240 --> 1:44:38.000]  and lets them hit, you know, a huge number of their users.
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:41.480]  And it was something that they could announce at WWDC while they were announcing that
[1:44:41.480 --> 1:44:45.160]  I forget the four or five biggest game engines in the world. We're all supporting it.
[1:44:45.160 --> 1:44:48.000]  So for most developers, they quote unquote get it for free because the engine that they're
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:50.840]  already using is just now getting the benefits of all of that.
[1:44:50.840 --> 1:44:57.480]  Right. Right. And it's definitely a, uh, yeah, like I said, it's in broad strokes. It's
[1:44:57.480 --> 1:45:03.000]  the sort of thing Apple could only do now that they're big and demarket leader in that
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:07.760]  wouldn't, it just wasn't possible in the old days when they were the, the little guy
[1:45:07.760 --> 1:45:10.960]  on the sides. Yeah, when the, when the Adobe's in Microsoft could say no, we're not going
[1:45:10.960 --> 1:45:17.120]  to support your, your RAP city. Yeah, that's a, you know, perfect example. Right.
[1:45:17.120 --> 1:45:21.000]  Although the RAP city thing was a little bit more, it's funny because they were a little
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:25.960]  bit more adamant back then where their initial proposal with adamant with, with RAP
[1:45:25.960 --> 1:45:30.680]  city was you're going to rewrite your apps in cocoa or else you have to run in this
[1:45:30.680 --> 1:45:38.240]  little, little ghetto, uh, environment. Whereas, you know, even with Swift, like I said,
[1:45:38.240 --> 1:45:44.320]  they're not saying you have to use Swift, even though they could really, I mean, I think
[1:45:44.320 --> 1:45:48.920]  they could get away with it, but you know, they're not because I feel like there's, um,
[1:45:48.920 --> 1:45:54.160]  a humility to them. Yeah, I mean, absolutely. And you get people like, you know,
[1:45:54.160 --> 1:45:56.960]  Brent Simmons now, we get a play around with it and blog about all their experiences with
[1:45:56.960 --> 1:46:00.640]  it and it benefits everybody. It's almost like a built in, they don't do beta's away. Google
[1:46:00.640 --> 1:46:04.440]  does, but the way they're releasing it gives a lot of people a lot of time to weigh in
[1:46:04.440 --> 1:46:08.880]  beyond the five and then 100 people at Apple who knew about it. Let me take a break here
[1:46:08.880 --> 1:46:15.360]  and thank our third and final sponsor of the show. And it's our good friends at hover,
[1:46:15.360 --> 1:46:23.560]  H-O-V-E-R. Um, hover is, and I say this without any hesitation, the world's best way
[1:46:23.560 --> 1:46:30.880]  to manage and buy domain names. They're a domain register and they're the best. They really
[1:46:30.880 --> 1:46:35.160]  are. They've been around for a long time. They've been around, I think, 15 years, maybe
[1:46:35.160 --> 1:46:44.320]  even more. Um, they have tremendous customer service. They have a no gimmick, no upsell,
[1:46:44.320 --> 1:46:50.520]  no scammy buying process. They have great search for domain names. They have great tools
[1:46:50.520 --> 1:46:54.760]  to help you. If the one you're looking for your first gasses, the domain name you want,
[1:46:54.760 --> 1:46:59.800]  you type it in ends up, it's already taken, ends up none of the, the, the top level domains
[1:46:59.800 --> 1:47:04.440]  where it's available or what you want. They have great tools to help you find one, a similar
[1:47:04.440 --> 1:47:12.360]  domain name that you do want. Um, in less than five minutes with hover, you can find the
[1:47:12.360 --> 1:47:16.320]  domain name you want, get it up and running. All you have to do is search for keywords
[1:47:16.320 --> 1:47:21.400]  and they'll show you the best options. Uh, if you've ever registered a domain name anywhere
[1:47:21.400 --> 1:47:26.160]  else and I'm guessing that the number of listeners of the show who, who own just one domain
[1:47:26.160 --> 1:47:30.480]  name is probably minimal. I mean, I think most of the people like me probably have a problem
[1:47:30.480 --> 1:47:35.080]  and have too many domain names, most of them unused. But if you've ever registered a domain
[1:47:35.080 --> 1:47:40.320]  name anywhere else, you know that most of the other registrars out there make it a really
[1:47:40.320 --> 1:47:45.800]  unpleasant experience. They make it complicated just to buy what you really need. They
[1:47:45.800 --> 1:47:49.320]  try to upsell you with stuff. You don't need on your way to the shopping cart. You have
[1:47:49.320 --> 1:47:53.400]  to double check that they haven't already inserted something that you don't want in there.
[1:47:53.400 --> 1:47:59.120]  And they make you pay extra to upgrade for things that should be included like who is privacy.
[1:47:59.120 --> 1:48:04.480]  Like you don't have to pay extra to hover to get your, uh, who is, uh, record made private.
[1:48:04.480 --> 1:48:08.120]  It's just part of the service that they offer because who wouldn't want it made private?
[1:48:08.120 --> 1:48:13.920]  Uh, because I remember years ago, it used to be your who is registry had to have your
[1:48:13.920 --> 1:48:19.360]  home phone number in it or an active working phone number and then, uh, telemarkers could
[1:48:19.360 --> 1:48:24.240]  just go through who has records and get a, you know, a list of working phone numbers.
[1:48:24.240 --> 1:48:29.040]  You don't want that. You want, uh, privacy. Hover just gives it to you for free. Here's
[1:48:29.040 --> 1:48:33.560]  the most amazing thing. This, I say this every time that they sponsor the show, they have
[1:48:33.560 --> 1:48:39.440]  what they call part of their technical support is free valetransfer service. So if you've
[1:48:39.440 --> 1:48:46.480]  already got domains at some other registrar, if you're willing to give hover, your login
[1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:51.360]  information to your, to your registry account at the other registrar, they will just move
[1:48:51.360 --> 1:48:58.240]  your domains over from your old registrar to your new one at hover and take care of all
[1:48:58.240 --> 1:49:02.880]  the stuff that needs to be changed, the DNS and all that stuff. This is all their, their
[1:49:02.880 --> 1:49:09.080]  valetransfer people do their experts in moving domains. You, like me, probably are not an expert
[1:49:09.080 --> 1:49:13.840]  in moving domains. And when you do it, you make a mistake with DNS, you can ruin your
[1:49:13.840 --> 1:49:19.280]  day. You could knock your website offline for the day before when you fix it, propagates
[1:49:19.280 --> 1:49:26.560]  to everywhere that got the bad stuff. Um, just amazing. No way. No hold. No transfer technical
[1:49:26.560 --> 1:49:31.440]  support. You just call them up. You call them up on a phone and they answer the phone like
[1:49:31.440 --> 1:49:38.400]  a person answers the phone. Amazing. So where do you go to find out more? Go to hover.com

[1:50:12.240 --> 1:50:17.280]  I didn't move my stuff over to hover before. So my thanks to hover. Drink any good Scotch lately,
[1:50:17.280 --> 1:50:21.760]  Renee? Only one I'm out with you and Guy. That's the, that's the time when I get the
[1:50:21.760 --> 1:50:26.960]  bourbon in the Scotch. I don't think I've had any Scotch lately. Or if I do, I don't remember.
[1:50:27.680 --> 1:50:33.680]  So lack of Christmas apple events. Yeah. Um, so that's it though. I think that what else
[1:50:33.680 --> 1:50:38.000]  it was up for 2014 in review. I think they sort of two things that we could touch on just quickly.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:42.720]  One is the Tim Cook beyond just running an apple, but the, the moves he's made towards
[1:50:42.720 --> 1:50:49.120]  the inclusivity and towards equal opportunity. Oh, I can't believe I didn't think of that.
[1:50:49.120 --> 1:50:54.480]  I think that's, it's absolutely been a big year for that. That his essay, I think was just
[1:50:54.480 --> 1:51:00.480]  absolutely pitch perfect. Um, just his own version of, you know, thoughts on, but it was so much
[1:51:00.480 --> 1:51:08.240]  more personal. Yeah, I think even if he hadn't written that and come out himself as gay this year,
[1:51:08.240 --> 1:51:14.160]  I, I think it would still be worth talking about the, like you said inclusivity and et cetera,
[1:51:14.160 --> 1:51:20.160]  that, that he's led and that apple is pushed this year. It's terrific. And it reminds me of the
[1:51:20.160 --> 1:51:24.000]  story that I heard, uh, you know, what's, what's got forest all where he really wanted to make
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:29.840]  apple a more inclusive company. And he believed that you in order to hire more, more diversity,
[1:51:29.840 --> 1:51:33.920]  you had to have more diversity in the hiring process. So when he would get, they had terrific
[1:51:33.920 --> 1:51:37.840]  female engineer, I mean, Vicki Murley famously, but terrific female engineers on the Safari team,
[1:51:37.840 --> 1:51:41.760]  for example, and they would, they would not only send them on the resumes, but they would send
[1:51:41.760 --> 1:51:46.080]  them out to, you know, on the job hunts to the, to the colleges because they knew that they would
[1:51:46.080 --> 1:51:51.280]  come back with a different perspective. And we, we haven't seen tremendous spread of that effect.
[1:51:51.280 --> 1:51:56.640]  We haven't seen a huge swing in the amount of women or minorities in jobs in Silicon Valley,
[1:51:56.640 --> 1:52:01.040]  but we have seen improvements. And I think with Apple's report as disappointing as the results
[1:52:01.040 --> 1:52:05.360]  might be to many people, uh, the exposure that it gets and the willingness for people to want to
[1:52:05.360 --> 1:52:10.240]  make it better. I think we're huge this year. Yeah. And I think it's again, another one of
[1:52:10.240 --> 1:52:17.120]  those things where I think you can really just take Tim Cook at his word. Yeah. And it's no euphemism.
[1:52:17.120 --> 1:52:22.080]  It's not just, you know, trying to say what people want to hear. I think he means it where
[1:52:22.080 --> 1:52:27.760]  A, he thinks it's just right. It's just the right thing to do. But B, that, that fierce competitor
[1:52:27.760 --> 1:52:33.840]  in him, you can tell when he says it that it's, there's, there's obviously so much untapped talent
[1:52:34.640 --> 1:52:42.240]  outside the white male engineer, you know, whites and Asians, you know, that everybody else,
[1:52:42.240 --> 1:52:50.240]  women, people of color, uh, men and women, uh, it's, the talent is out there. And Apple is
[1:52:50.240 --> 1:52:57.120]  starved for talent and they want it. You know, so there's an addition to the, the, the justice
[1:52:57.120 --> 1:53:02.480]  angle, you know, that it's the way it should be that that people don't feel welcome in the industry.
[1:53:02.480 --> 1:53:09.600]  But it, there's also just a purely competitive aspect to it. It's, it was that beautiful moment
[1:53:09.600 --> 1:53:12.480]  to with Tim Cook when they were at the shareholders meeting and the guys stood up and he said,
[1:53:12.480 --> 1:53:16.320]  why are you wasting, basically said, why are you wasting my money on environmentalism and
[1:53:16.320 --> 1:53:20.080]  accessibility? And Tim Cook said, you know, that this stuff matters. And if you don't think it matters,
[1:53:20.080 --> 1:53:25.760]  just get the hell out of the stock. Right. It was the guy brought up ROI. Yes, investment. And, you know,
[1:53:25.760 --> 1:53:31.440]  and it's, it was fascinating, you know, that, that Cook got his angry as he did and said,
[1:53:31.440 --> 1:53:36.560]  everything we do isn't about the bloody ROI. Yeah. And it's funny that he said bloody because
[1:53:36.560 --> 1:53:40.640]  he's, you know, clearly he's not British. But he's the cool one, right? Like we'd expect that
[1:53:40.640 --> 1:53:44.320]  from Steve Jobs, Steve Jobs was bombastic, but Tim Cook always looked like he would just sit there
[1:53:44.320 --> 1:53:49.920]  at with laser beams in his eyes. And that for him is hugely emotional. Right. It wouldn't be
[1:53:49.920 --> 1:53:55.440]  surprising if Tim Cook, I mean, if Steve Jobs had gotten angry at a shareholder. Yeah. Whereas Tim Cook
[1:53:55.440 --> 1:54:00.080]  is the guy you'd think no matter what any crackpot shareholder would say, he's not going to get angry,
[1:54:00.080 --> 1:54:05.280]  but he did that clearly angered him. And again, like when I think it was a financial times that
[1:54:05.280 --> 1:54:10.320]  named him their CEO of the year, there was somebody who was a couple of people. But the one that
[1:54:10.320 --> 1:54:16.320]  I linked to, I remember, they led their, their, here's why with that anecdote. And I think,
[1:54:16.320 --> 1:54:20.720]  and hindsight, it was the most telling anecdote of the year, you know, in terms of Tim Cook
[1:54:21.840 --> 1:54:26.240]  being unscripted. Yes. You know, I think in terms of what was scripted and what it was planned,
[1:54:26.800 --> 1:54:32.080]  his, you know, his coming out essay in business week was probably it. But that moment at the
[1:54:32.080 --> 1:54:37.280]  shareholders meeting, I think was the most telling impromptu moment. Yeah. And you know,
[1:54:37.280 --> 1:54:40.880]  it really made me think, it's strange to say, but it made me think a lot more of Tim Cook because,
[1:54:40.880 --> 1:54:46.080]  you know, it is hard to tell he is so controlled in public and so on message and so on point,
[1:54:46.080 --> 1:54:51.520]  and he's so gifted as a thinker and someone who's, who's controls logistics and all these things
[1:54:51.520 --> 1:54:56.160]  to see his emotional response sort of added a whole new dimension to him as not just a CEO of
[1:54:56.160 --> 1:55:05.440]  a person. Yeah, I think absolutely. And, you know, and I think that's, it's also to me a sign of the
[1:55:05.440 --> 1:55:12.080]  long-term thinking that the Apple, you know, under jobs, you know, constantly, you know, consistently
[1:55:12.080 --> 1:55:18.640]  since the, since the post next reunification era, you know, that they've been a long-term company
[1:55:18.640 --> 1:55:24.240]  that's looking at building a company that's going to be here for 50 or 100 years. You know,
[1:55:24.240 --> 1:55:29.120]  that's going to outlive everybody who's at the company today. You know, and there's, I really do
[1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:32.720]  think that that's what they're looking at, that they're trying to build an institution that's going
[1:55:32.720 --> 1:55:39.440]  to still be here when Tim Cook and Phil Schiller and Angela Arns are all long retired and, you know,
[1:55:40.720 --> 1:55:46.720]  frankly in the grave. Yeah. And how do you do that? Well, you don't do it by sweating the ROI on
[1:55:46.720 --> 1:55:53.840]  every single thing you do. And it's, you know, it's the other thing too that, and I think it's probably
[1:55:53.840 --> 1:56:00.160]  what burned him up is it's not like Apple, you know, has dipped into low profit margins and had
[1:56:00.160 --> 1:56:05.920]  they're still spending money. I think it was in particular with the, the clean energy for the
[1:56:05.920 --> 1:56:11.600]  data centers and spending money on, you know, worrying about things like their environmental
[1:56:11.600 --> 1:56:17.840]  impact on global warming or climate change, whatever you want to call it, carbon footprint.
[1:56:17.840 --> 1:56:21.520]  Yeah, it definitely struck a chord with him. It was a good chord to be struck.
[1:56:21.520 --> 1:56:31.280]  And, you know, the whole, you know, social equality angle is clearly, I don't think Steve Jobs
[1:56:31.280 --> 1:56:37.840]  was against it, but it's, you know, Apple is clearly as a company is clearly more outspoken about
[1:56:37.840 --> 1:56:41.360]  it now than they were under him. Well, jobs seem to believe that all that stuff was deeply
[1:56:41.360 --> 1:56:45.360]  personal. Charitable donations and support for causes was something that he believed that Apple
[1:56:45.360 --> 1:56:49.360]  paying that people could let people spend their own money on, but it wasn't at a corporate level
[1:56:49.360 --> 1:56:54.160]  where Tim Cook, you know, he, he took Apple on the gay pride parade. He's put Apple behind
[1:56:54.160 --> 1:56:59.440]  equal employment legislation. He's really believed that the power and wealth of Apple can be used
[1:56:59.440 --> 1:57:05.440]  for more than just generating more power and wealth. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. All right. And what
[1:57:05.440 --> 1:57:08.320]  was your second thing? My second thing was I was going to talk about the app store stuff, but I
[1:57:08.320 --> 1:57:12.320]  feel like it's a bit of a downer at the end now. Yeah. Maybe we did him in the wrong order.
[1:57:12.320 --> 1:57:21.760]  Well, we should still do it. We'll, we'll let Wiscuits fix it. Okay. Right with the,
[1:57:24.080 --> 1:57:31.280]  well, the today view widgets, right? That people, you know, in short, it was like Apple introduced
[1:57:31.280 --> 1:57:37.280]  these today view widgets and WWDC. And then, you know, I think they might have even literally said,
[1:57:37.280 --> 1:57:43.040]  we can't wait to see what you guys do with them. Yeah. And then they saw what people were doing with
[1:57:43.040 --> 1:57:53.680]  them and rejected a whole bunch of the most clever versions of them. Who was it? I think it was James
[1:57:53.680 --> 1:58:01.280]  Thompson's peak calc. Yeah. That was simultaneously being promoted in the app store with a banner
[1:58:01.280 --> 1:58:08.080]  for great new uses of today view widgets because he added a calculator. So you, without even
[1:58:08.080 --> 1:58:12.240]  opening the app, right? And today view, if you, if you put the peak calc widget in, you could just
[1:58:12.240 --> 1:58:17.600]  do your calculation right there. It was being promoted as a great new widget at the same time
[1:58:18.240 --> 1:58:22.480]  that like the review team had contacted him and said, you know what, that's outside the bounds of
[1:58:22.480 --> 1:58:26.240]  what we intended to be enabled. So you're going to have to submit a new build that takes that out.
[1:58:26.240 --> 1:58:31.040]  I mean, it's sound from the outside, it looks absolutely insane. And I think it's worth explaining not
[1:58:31.040 --> 1:58:36.640]  to excuse it, but sort of to explain it. So extensibility is this huge new feature. And everyone is
[1:58:36.640 --> 1:58:40.480]  trying to ship iOS 8 and developers are trying to get their apps approved. And app review is,
[1:58:40.480 --> 1:58:44.320]  it's the worst time of the year to work in app review. And they bring in as many people as they can.
[1:58:44.320 --> 1:58:48.800]  And they try to get as many apps as possible onto the store. And as soon as an app is approved,
[1:58:48.800 --> 1:58:53.040]  and this is all under Phil Schiller's org, that is that moves to Eddie Q's org where they have app
[1:58:53.040 --> 1:58:57.600]  editorial. And they need to program the entire app store promotion for all that stuff. And all they
[1:58:57.600 --> 1:59:01.440]  see is approved. They have no idea what might be going on behind the scenes. It's flies approved,
[1:59:01.440 --> 1:59:05.760]  it's fine for editorial. And then when things sort of slow down again, people who are higher up
[1:59:05.760 --> 1:59:09.600]  in app store review, who have a lot of ideas about what they believe, you know, they,
[1:59:09.600 --> 1:59:14.240]  they sincerely believe certain things about experience and whether a button will confuse an average
[1:59:14.240 --> 1:59:17.920]  user or whether someone is spending time in notification center. And they're not supposed to,
[1:59:17.920 --> 1:59:22.560]  it's supposed to be a quick conduit. And they care a lot about these things and they'll flag it
[1:59:22.560 --> 1:59:26.880]  and then it'll get removed. And it won't make any sense and developers will appeal and it'll go
[1:59:26.880 --> 1:59:31.040]  to a higher level. And it might end up on the executive review committees desk. And they might say,
[1:59:31.040 --> 1:59:36.080]  it's fine, you know, stop worrying about it. And but I think extensibility was so new that it
[1:59:36.080 --> 1:59:41.040]  created a disconnect between what was technically possible and what people who had been in app review,
[1:59:41.040 --> 1:59:45.680]  you know, at a slightly higher level for many years thought should be the experience on the
[1:59:45.680 --> 1:59:51.280]  system. Yeah, I think that's a very good way to put it. And I think maybe the transmit
[1:59:51.280 --> 2:00:02.880]  it was transmit, right? Yeah, that had the sharing to storage services like box.net and Dropbox
[2:00:03.520 --> 2:00:14.400]  and I cloud drive, you know, that completely within the, they didn't, they didn't use any non private
[2:00:14.400 --> 2:00:22.240]  or non public APIs, all public APIs, the sharing sheet itself, the what's it called move to
[2:00:22.240 --> 2:00:29.120]  whatever you want to send to send to. They don't have any control over it's part of that whole
[2:00:32.480 --> 2:00:37.280]  inner application communication that that enables so many of these continuity features.
[2:00:37.280 --> 2:00:42.240]  Yeah, it's one sheet that can't line up veto certain services, right, because the system is drawing
[2:00:42.240 --> 2:00:47.920]  it, which is why Apple is opening up, seemingly opening up and letting you do these things that
[2:00:47.920 --> 2:00:54.800]  you couldn't do before. And then they were told, you can't, you can't do this for iCloud drive,
[2:00:54.800 --> 2:00:59.440]  you can't send anything you, you can't send anything that wasn't created in your, your own app
[2:00:59.440 --> 2:01:05.200]  to iCloud drive, which meant like you said, because you don't have line item veto on the services
[2:01:05.200 --> 2:01:10.240]  that are listed that you had to take out the whole thing. And now the app couldn't send to anybody,
[2:01:10.240 --> 2:01:16.000]  including Dropbox or Box or anybody who Apple doesn't care about, whereas it's almost seemed like
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:21.280]  it was exactly why they added the send to in the first place so that you could do things like
[2:01:21.280 --> 2:01:25.440]  that. It's easy. Again, when you look at it from certain perspective, and I'm not supporting
[2:01:25.440 --> 2:01:28.960]  this perspective, but I like some other thing, like, you know, I understand is that they didn't,
[2:01:28.960 --> 2:01:32.160]  they don't want the line item veto because they think that there can be disputes within companies
[2:01:32.160 --> 2:01:36.800]  that would cause one company to sort of remove a competitor or remove a service. And that's not
[2:01:36.800 --> 2:01:41.120]  to the benefit of the user. But the original model on Mac, it's the same, like there was Apple
[2:01:41.120 --> 2:01:45.520]  made a calculator widget for OS 10. They didn't make one for iOS for a variety of reasons,
[2:01:45.520 --> 2:01:48.400]  but they thought it wasn't the right experience. So they deliberately didn't make one.
[2:01:49.200 --> 2:01:53.120]  Then, you know, James Thompson, who's a phenomenal developer, did make one for iCloud drive on the
[2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:56.960]  Mac, you could put any arbitrary file there. But on iOS, it was sort of understood that you could
[2:01:56.960 --> 2:02:01.840]  only put files that you created or edited because that meant the user knew that they were in your app
[2:02:01.840 --> 2:02:05.760]  and was working on them and they would understand it was in that space. But then something like
[2:02:05.760 --> 2:02:10.400]  transit comes along, which is the, you know, quote unquote, Steve Jobs unforeseen thing. And it's
[2:02:10.400 --> 2:02:14.400]  taken to a level where they can say, this isn't what we intended it for it to do, but it's not
[2:02:14.400 --> 2:02:18.400]  taken to the level of thinking, well, is it a good thing anyway, like should we let it in
[2:02:18.400 --> 2:02:22.880]  anyway? So it gets rejected, then it gets appealed, then it gets overturned. And it makes Apple
[2:02:22.880 --> 2:02:27.120]  look horrible in the press. It stresses out the developers and it affects the features that customers
[2:02:27.120 --> 2:02:30.960]  believe that they've paid for. And you wouldn't have paid for it. And it's just not a good outcome
[2:02:30.960 --> 2:02:35.440]  for anybody. Yeah. But I do. Yeah. And if you, like you said, though, I think if you want to try to
[2:02:35.440 --> 2:02:43.360]  understand why it's that it's so new. Yeah. And there's so many moving pieces. And, you know, the
[2:02:43.360 --> 2:02:47.360]  thing that made, if you understood everything that was going on, the thing that made transmits,
[2:02:47.360 --> 2:02:52.240]  and again, transparent wasn't yanked from the app store. They got a, you know, mostly friendly
[2:02:52.240 --> 2:02:58.000]  notification that they were told, you need to submit a new build that takes this out. You know,
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:01.840]  and they couldn't wait forever. I'm sure that at some point, Apple would, you know,
[2:03:01.840 --> 2:03:05.600]  it's like two weeks, usually I think. Yeah. And you know, it's more or less, you know, take out
[2:03:05.600 --> 2:03:09.840]  those lines of code that do this, test your new build and submit it, and we'll do this.
[2:03:12.080 --> 2:03:17.280]  I don't think it's any surprise that it was the iOS version that caused the problem. Now, if
[2:03:17.280 --> 2:03:20.720]  you understood what was going on, it didn't make any sense, though, because nothing you could do
[2:03:20.720 --> 2:03:28.320]  from the iOS version, no file that you could put move from transmit to your iCloud drive, you
[2:03:28.320 --> 2:03:33.360]  couldn't do the exact same thing on Yosemite. Yeah. You could do the exact same thing. So, there was
[2:03:33.360 --> 2:03:39.760]  nothing that they were that, that whoever it was who thought they needed to not be able to do this
[2:03:39.760 --> 2:03:45.200]  from their iOS app. It was seemingly unaware that whatever it was that you would do, whether it
[2:03:45.200 --> 2:03:50.320]  was a porno file or a illegally downloaded movie or whatever it is that they were worried about,
[2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:54.480]  was it copyright, whatever? Or just stealing files, you know, you load an app and it starts taking
[2:03:54.480 --> 2:04:00.960]  your files and putting it on someone's server somewhere. Yes. It was all stuff that you could do
[2:04:00.960 --> 2:04:04.880]  right in the finder in Yosemite. You can put whatever file you want in your iCloud drive,
[2:04:04.880 --> 2:04:08.960]  you know, in the same way that the finder doesn't keep you from moving, you know, a file from
[2:04:08.960 --> 2:04:14.640]  any folder anywhere to any other folder. But I think it's understandable because that,
[2:04:14.640 --> 2:04:19.040]  you know, the review teams, and correct me if you're wrong, I think you might know more about
[2:04:19.040 --> 2:04:23.600]  their internal makeup. But the iOS, it's not like a review team. There's iOS reviewers and Mac
[2:04:23.840 --> 2:04:31.680]  users. And the iOS reviewers are coming from a year's long history of, you know, what's restricted
[2:04:31.680 --> 2:04:39.360]  on iOS and moving files that weren't created in app, whatever your app is to anywhere else
[2:04:39.360 --> 2:04:44.080]  has always been forbidden. And so it's, you know, I could see how it even got high up,
[2:04:44.080 --> 2:04:49.520]  not to the highest levels, but pretty high up. And they thought, no, this has to be against
[2:04:49.520 --> 2:04:53.200]  the rules. This isn't something that iOS does. I wrote a piece about this. And one of the things
[2:04:53.200 --> 2:04:57.600]  I just wanted to, and to help people understand is that when you say like Apple rejected it,
[2:04:57.600 --> 2:05:01.280]  Apple has these same discussions. Like if you listen to ATP or you listen to the talk show,
[2:05:01.280 --> 2:05:04.080]  that's the discussion that's happening inside Apple as well. And there's people
[2:05:04.080 --> 2:05:07.680]  advocating very strongly that though these things should be allowed and there's people
[2:05:07.680 --> 2:05:11.040]  advocating saying, this button here is going to confuse somebody. They'll press it. They'll suddenly
[2:05:11.040 --> 2:05:14.960]  be an app they won't know where they are. And they're not modeling it for me or you or, you know,
[2:05:14.960 --> 2:05:19.920]  Marco or John or somebody. They're marketing it for our parents and, you know, our non sophisticated
[2:05:19.920 --> 2:05:24.480]  tech using relatives. And they, there are some people who are deeply, deeply concerned that they
[2:05:24.480 --> 2:05:30.160]  have a very sensible, understandable experience. Now you could argue that widgets and extensibility
[2:05:30.160 --> 2:05:34.720]  in general is a pretty nerdy feature. And anyone using it probably knows what they're doing. And I
[2:05:34.720 --> 2:05:39.840]  think that's the argument that's winning out now. But it really is these sorts of discussions.
[2:05:39.840 --> 2:05:43.680]  And people want more rules sometimes in the app store, but Apple believes that the more
[2:05:43.680 --> 2:05:47.680]  my understanding is that Apple believes that the more rules will actually chill innovation.
[2:05:47.680 --> 2:05:51.840]  And they'd much rather see James Thompson as annoying as it is, make a calculator widget,
[2:05:51.840 --> 2:05:55.600]  have it rejected, then have it approved, then him to see a rule and just never make it or have
[2:05:55.600 --> 2:05:59.600]  to lobby for a change in the rule that might take years. Because right now is ugly and is
[2:05:59.600 --> 2:06:04.080]  frustrating as the process was, we have peak, we have transmit, we have all these things now
[2:06:04.080 --> 2:06:08.000]  officially on the store and we have these things officially clarified. And it's only been like two
[2:06:08.000 --> 2:06:12.560]  months. It's a good point. Yeah, I would like to see, and I wrote a thing about this,
[2:06:12.560 --> 2:06:17.040]  but I would, I think it would be great for everybody if there was a public facing vice president
[2:06:17.040 --> 2:06:20.400]  of app store. There is, you know, there are really good directors of app stores. They're really
[2:06:20.400 --> 2:06:25.600]  good people in both, um, Shiller and Q's org, but they're split over all these different
[2:06:25.600 --> 2:06:30.800]  organizations and much like software development accelerated under Federiggy and stores are
[2:06:30.800 --> 2:06:35.760]  accelerating under Angela Areans. I think if there was somebody whose only job it was to make a
[2:06:35.760 --> 2:06:40.240]  fantastic experience on the app store, whether it's making review better, whether it's adding
[2:06:40.240 --> 2:06:45.600]  sloppy search and finally to the app store, but to someone who all he had to do was wake up every
[2:06:45.600 --> 2:06:49.520]  day and make developers and customers super happy. I think that would improve the situation for
[2:06:49.520 --> 2:06:56.720]  everybody. Uh, what's the word? There's a word like, uh, newspapers sometimes have them
[2:06:56.720 --> 2:07:01.680]  um, bussments on budsmen. That's yeah, I was thinking at the New York Times doesn't call them
[2:07:01.680 --> 2:07:07.840]  an on budsmen. They call the, uh, the public editor. Only, and I, my understanding of why is that
[2:07:07.840 --> 2:07:12.720]  for decades they rejected having an on budsmen and then when they finally added an on budsmen,
[2:07:12.720 --> 2:07:16.640]  they didn't want to say, okay, now we have an on budsmen. They just call their own budsmen,
[2:07:16.640 --> 2:07:22.400]  the public editor. But the idea of the on budsmen is that at a newspaper, for example, the on
[2:07:22.400 --> 2:07:27.840]  budsmen doesn't, is independent and doesn't report to the, you know, editor in chief of the
[2:07:27.840 --> 2:07:33.120]  newspaper. And so a reader who has a problem with let's say the, and some sort of bias in the
[2:07:33.120 --> 2:07:37.600]  coverage of anything can go to the on budsmen and the on budsmen can conduct like an independent
[2:07:37.600 --> 2:07:46.160]  review. I would love to see Apple have, uh, uh, an app store on budsmen. Yeah. You know, and,
[2:07:46.160 --> 2:07:50.720]  and you know, I get, I think the way to do it would be to, to, you know, write a blog
[2:07:50.720 --> 2:07:58.560]  and have a block, not, not, you know, so it's not like anybody could, uh, create an on
[2:07:58.560 --> 2:08:03.200]  budsmen issue. The on budsmen would still get to choose what they wrote about, but that they
[2:08:03.200 --> 2:08:10.640]  could look at something like pcalc or transmit. And, you know, not just like when I write about it
[2:08:10.640 --> 2:08:16.560]  or you write about it and kind of make a stink and hope somebody at Apple reads our sites and
[2:08:16.560 --> 2:08:21.760]  does something about it. But before going public with it, the on budsmen could go inside and
[2:08:21.760 --> 2:08:26.960]  go to somebody and do the research and maybe get it clarified without the stink.
[2:08:26.960 --> 2:08:30.880]  Yeah. It's sort of deescalated before it hits media and the executives.
[2:08:32.080 --> 2:08:38.800]  Yeah. But then the on budsmen as somebody inside Apple could then write a post that maybe explains
[2:08:38.800 --> 2:08:44.560]  what Apple is thinking. And again, without making new rules and creating an ever more complicated
[2:08:44.560 --> 2:08:51.040]  set of guidelines for the app store, at least sort of explain in plain English. Here's the
[2:08:51.040 --> 2:08:55.280]  sort of things that are okay in a today view widget and here's the sort of things that aren't.
[2:08:56.080 --> 2:08:59.920]  It's, and I think that's, that's a really good idea because, uh, I mean, we're friends with a lot
[2:08:59.920 --> 2:09:03.280]  of people who make productivity and creativity apps and that's where this is a problem.
[2:09:03.280 --> 2:09:07.360]  The people making clash of clans and candy crush and all the people who are making the billions
[2:09:07.360 --> 2:09:10.480]  of dollars on the app store. There's no uncertainty for them. There's no problem with
[2:09:10.480 --> 2:09:15.360]  app review for them. They're all fine. Right. That never, I'm sure it never occurred to the
[2:09:15.360 --> 2:09:20.160]  developer to make a version of crossy road that runs as a today view widget.
[2:09:20.160 --> 2:09:23.760]  Yeah. And yeah. I mean, those, those are the easy problems. It's the ones that are, that are more
[2:09:23.760 --> 2:09:28.080]  black ones that are more shades of gray that have these problems. And the other argument that
[2:09:28.080 --> 2:09:32.400]  it's killing innovation, I mean, I've had Android devices for four or five years. They have a much easier
[2:09:33.360 --> 2:09:38.560]  review process than Apple does. And I've not seen the groundbreaking, you know, platform making
[2:09:38.560 --> 2:09:43.840]  sort of future apps arrive on Android any faster because of that than iOS. And it's easy to say,
[2:09:43.840 --> 2:09:47.840]  maybe Android sucks. And that's why it doesn't happen, but it's also possible that Apple does
[2:09:47.840 --> 2:09:52.000]  add background tasks. And they do add, you know, extensibility and they, they do add the features
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:56.800]  that they need to add to give developers sort of the tools that they need to make these sorts of apps.
[2:09:56.800 --> 2:10:01.520]  And it's possible that things like workflow and Uber get made regardless of what app review does,
[2:10:01.520 --> 2:10:06.080]  because, you know, those things as, as cool as they are, they don't, they don't come across anywhere
[2:10:06.080 --> 2:10:12.160]  near the lines that Apple draws. Well, on the other hand, though, I do think, to take a
[2:10:12.160 --> 2:10:20.160]  devil's advocate position, you do, we do have far more, far richer variety of, of outside the
[2:10:20.160 --> 2:10:28.800]  bounds of the stock factory OS productivity software on Mac than we do iOS. Yes. The difference is
[2:10:28.800 --> 2:10:35.760]  that iOS is starting with this foundation of, we Apple are promising you that nothing you install
[2:10:35.760 --> 2:10:42.160]  from the App Store is going to do something like run away in the background or, you know,
[2:10:42.160 --> 2:10:48.960]  be hard to uninstall. If you don't like it, you know, that you, you know, whereas the, the risks
[2:10:48.960 --> 2:10:54.560]  you take on the Mac of allowing anything and everything that you can download outside the App Store
[2:10:54.560 --> 2:10:59.520]  is that you have utilities that can be hard to uninstall. I tried to install,
[2:10:59.520 --> 2:11:04.000]  uninstall Blackberry Connect and it was a nightmare. It's, you know, it's always, and I think it's
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:08.800]  less of a problem than it used to be, but it's always been a problem and that you might add uncertainty.
[2:11:08.800 --> 2:11:13.280]  And if you feel like, you know, like a non-technical user, like we know that if the fans running on
[2:11:13.280 --> 2:11:17.600]  your computer and you don't think it should be, you can go to activity monitor or up there to the
[2:11:17.600 --> 2:11:22.160]  battery menu and it'll tell you, you know, in recent versions, who's, you know, which app is using
[2:11:22.160 --> 2:11:29.040]  excessive power? You know, but it's, it can be, it can be confusing to a typical user. They don't
[2:11:29.040 --> 2:11:34.160]  know to do those things. And what if it's some app that they've never heard of because it's, you know,
[2:11:34.160 --> 2:11:39.040]  the helper app for another app? It's a faceless background app that doesn't, doesn't even show up
[2:11:39.040 --> 2:11:45.840]  in their doc. Well, then what do they do? You know, iOS has this promise of we're, you're never
[2:11:45.840 --> 2:11:50.800]  going to have to worry about those things. And, you know, part of that promise, it only happens if,
[2:11:50.800 --> 2:11:55.280]  if everything goes through an App Store review process, which is why to install the keyboard,
[2:11:55.280 --> 2:11:58.800]  you go to download an app. And even though that app does absolutely nothing once you download
[2:11:58.800 --> 2:12:02.960]  it. And if you delete it, the keyboard goes away. It's still the same mechanism to deliver all
[2:12:02.960 --> 2:12:07.520]  the new features that they're adding. And it's an interesting problem to solve. And I think, you
[2:12:07.520 --> 2:12:12.560]  know, I, I use pcalc the widget all the time. I bear, sorry James, I barely launched pcalc anymore
[2:12:12.560 --> 2:12:17.360]  because a widget is just enough almost all the time. And I use drafts and I use transmit and I love
[2:12:17.360 --> 2:12:21.920]  all these features. And I'm happy that Apple reversed the stuff. I just think that it's worth
[2:12:21.920 --> 2:12:26.400]  breaking down the process that happens because more you understand it. Did drafts get everything back?
[2:12:26.400 --> 2:12:31.600]  Yes. Well, I did, I wasn't aware of that. I knew that they, that they had had some, you know,
[2:12:31.600 --> 2:12:34.640]  the same type of issues. Yeah, well, that's good to know. The only thing that was rejected
[2:12:34.640 --> 2:12:38.320]  outright was the launch, the app launcher, because Apple really doesn't believe that other
[2:12:38.320 --> 2:12:41.440]  things should launch apps. And the guy who tried, there was a rule, it says you couldn't have
[2:12:41.440 --> 2:12:45.440]  keyboards and widgets. So the guy basically drew his own instead of invoking the built-in one and
[2:12:45.440 --> 2:12:49.440]  that was still rejected. Yeah, I think it comes down to my, all right, I forget I was arguing
[2:12:49.440 --> 2:12:54.960]  earlier words, you have to err on one side or the other. And that at least with iOS, Apple's going
[2:12:54.960 --> 2:13:05.040]  to continue to err on the side of being a little too strict. And, you know, the side effect of that,
[2:13:05.600 --> 2:13:13.840]  I like the benefit of that is that abusive software isn't going to, it's less likely to slip
[2:13:13.840 --> 2:13:20.000]  through. Yeah. The downside to it is, like you said, sometimes it's going to take some ugly
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:26.640]  airing of dirty laundry, public airing of dirty laundry to get it sufficiently, you know,
[2:13:26.640 --> 2:13:30.240]  looked at by a high enough level person. And I think, I don't want to call it a problem,
[2:13:30.240 --> 2:13:34.240]  but I think the sign of the change is that, you know, Craig Federicki, he skews more towards
[2:13:34.240 --> 2:13:39.840]  geeky than Scott Forestold. I mean, it was hard to get AirDrop on the iPhone. And now we have,
[2:13:39.840 --> 2:13:44.640]  you know, extensibility and continuity. An app store review hasn't changed the way software
[2:13:44.640 --> 2:13:49.360]  development has changed. You know, they're, they're still very much the organization they were
[2:13:49.360 --> 2:13:53.120]  back in the forest all year. And there's going to be some tension until that's worked out. As we
[2:13:53.120 --> 2:13:57.040]  get geekier features, we're going to, the iPhone was not made for geeks. It was made for
[2:13:57.040 --> 2:14:01.040]  app for mainstream people. It was a smartphone that everybody could use, but, you know, geeks loved it
[2:14:01.040 --> 2:14:05.440]  as well. And now it's becoming a phone that that works great for geeks because of these features.
[2:14:05.440 --> 2:14:10.240]  And I think app, app review is going to have to evolve the way software has. Yeah, totally agree.
[2:14:12.880 --> 2:14:16.480]  All right. I think that's, our catch is up. I think that's our year in review. Good year.
[2:14:16.480 --> 2:14:23.120]  Yeah, it was. Excited about next year? I can't wait. Everything from the Apple watch to the
[2:14:23.120 --> 2:14:28.880]  theoretically larger iPad to the new features. We'll see with it. I'm an iOS 9. I think it's going
[2:14:28.880 --> 2:14:33.360]  to be a great year. I think it's good. I think one thing is for sure. I think one thing when we,
[2:14:33.360 --> 2:14:39.280]  if we look back a year from now on 2015, I think the first half of 2015 is going to be a lot
[2:14:39.280 --> 2:14:42.720]  more interesting than the first half of 2014. Yeah, it's going to be hard in back. I think to the
[2:14:42.720 --> 2:14:47.520]  first year, I wouldn't be surprised if the first year, the first part of 2015 is very similar
[2:14:47.520 --> 2:14:51.840]  to the first part of 2010 and the eye watch is similar to the launch of the original iPad. Yeah,
[2:14:51.840 --> 2:14:57.600]  I do. Because I, you know, just off the top of my head, I expect both a bigger iPad and the watch
[2:14:57.600 --> 2:15:02.560]  in the first half. Yeah. Whether they come at the same event or not, I don't know, but, you know,
[2:15:02.560 --> 2:15:06.720]  I think they're both coming sort of before. I just don't know if the Apple TV will come with them
[2:15:06.720 --> 2:15:12.320]  where that's still in the garage. You know, honestly, no idea wouldn't be surprised. It would be huge
[2:15:12.320 --> 2:15:19.920]  if they did all three in the first half. That'd be almost unprecedented. And it just, as I'm not
[2:15:19.920 --> 2:15:25.440]  to try to, you know, err on the side of getting too excited, but it would kind of make sense in the
[2:15:25.440 --> 2:15:32.560]  context of Tim Cook's previous, you know, maybe over-promising of what they were going to deliver in
[2:15:32.560 --> 2:15:39.120]  2014 that some of these things, you know, maybe got bumped, you know, you know, Apple Pay and
[2:15:41.760 --> 2:15:46.560]  Apple Watch count as the plural new product categories.
[2:15:48.640 --> 2:15:52.960]  But it does seem like when he first started talking about that, I expected a little bit more,
[2:15:52.960 --> 2:15:56.560]  like maybe one more thing for 2014. Yeah, I don't know if you heard the same thing I did,
[2:15:56.560 --> 2:15:59.680]  but the Apple TV sounded like last spring and then it sounded like this fall and then it sounds like
[2:15:59.680 --> 2:16:03.520]  next spring. And it sounds like that's that's a bigger job than people thought it was originally
[2:16:03.520 --> 2:16:12.720]  going to be. Yeah, I definitely heard back at June and WWDC that it was maybe originally thought
[2:16:12.720 --> 2:16:17.680]  that it would come up before the end of 2014, but even back at June, it was no way. It's not even
[2:16:17.680 --> 2:16:22.720]  not even feasible for it to be a 2014 thing. I'm happy with that. I mean, I liked it when Apple
[2:16:22.720 --> 2:16:26.240]  had products spread across the year. I find everything coming in fall just quite a lot to deal with.
[2:16:26.240 --> 2:16:30.880]  Yeah, well, and the other thing too, that I think made it impossible and it's not even to get in
[2:16:30.880 --> 2:16:35.040]  any details of it, but it's just the simple fact that if it doesn't ship by October, it doesn't
[2:16:35.040 --> 2:16:39.920]  ship that year. Yes, that November and December don't count because they can. They're just too late
[2:16:39.920 --> 2:16:44.160]  for the holiday season. Absolutely. That if it can't be announced in October, it doesn't get
[2:16:44.160 --> 2:16:49.760]  announced till 2015 and it doesn't get announced in 2015, it's probably like more like February
[2:16:49.760 --> 2:16:53.840]  than January. Yeah, and we'd start to see signs already. I mean, if any of those products were
[2:16:53.840 --> 2:16:58.800]  like January, February, we'd start seeing things moving. Yeah, like November, December, January,
[2:16:58.800 --> 2:17:03.200]  not that Apple doesn't get work done, but products don't get slated for release in those months.
[2:17:04.080 --> 2:17:08.880]  All right, Renee, more people can find out more, see your great work at imore, of course,
[2:17:08.880 --> 2:17:14.640]  imore.com. What are your podcasts? List your podcasts. I have debug with Guy English. We talk to
[2:17:14.640 --> 2:17:19.200]  developers about developing stuff, and then I have vector with Guy English, Dave Whiskis, and
[2:17:19.200 --> 2:17:23.360]  Georgia Dow. We talk about the intersection of technology and humanity, and I do iterate with Mark Edwards
[2:17:23.360 --> 2:17:28.480]  and Seth Clifford, which is designer-oriented stuff. Who do you think is going to record more podcast
[2:17:28.480 --> 2:17:35.200]  episodes in 2015? You or Jason Snow? It's neck and neck, but I love that. Or maybe Mike Hurley,
[2:17:35.200 --> 2:17:44.080]  I mean, it's becoming a bit of a joke. They're all good shows. You're prolific. I like,
[2:17:44.080 --> 2:17:50.160]  here's what I like having you on this show, because I feel like on your regular shows, you defer
[2:17:50.160 --> 2:17:54.720]  to your guests, and sometimes I forget that you're even there. I'm like, where'd Renee go? I like to
[2:17:54.720 --> 2:18:00.640]  hear Renee piping. You are so deferential. I like having you here, and letting you go off, because
[2:18:00.640 --> 2:18:06.240]  man, you really know your shit. Thank you. I really appreciate that. All right. Well, thanks to you,
[2:18:06.240 --> 2:18:18.880]  and go check out Renee's shows and go read I'm on. Thank you, John. All right, I'm hit and stop.
