[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  He says he joined.
[00:02.000 --> 00:04.220]  Your weird avatar is not an apple, guy.
[00:04.220 --> 00:08.820]  You can pick which picture you want to, like, vend to people, and the picture you've chosen
[00:08.820 --> 00:10.860]  is the picture of you when you're 15.
[00:10.860 --> 00:13.740]  I mean, my picture is old.
[00:13.740 --> 00:14.740]  Hi, John!
[00:14.740 --> 00:15.740]  Nice to see you.
[00:15.740 --> 00:17.140]  My picture is old, but your picture...
[00:17.140 --> 00:19.020]  I love you too, man.
[00:19.020 --> 00:20.220]  I really miss you.
[00:20.220 --> 00:21.220]  It's been a tough year.
[00:21.220 --> 00:22.220]  Uh-huh.
[00:22.220 --> 00:23.220]  Uh-huh.
[00:23.220 --> 00:25.880]  You gotta learn how to work all this apple stuff.
[00:25.880 --> 00:26.880]  That's on Apple.
[00:26.880 --> 00:27.880]  It's not on Apple.
[00:27.880 --> 00:28.880]  It's on you!
[00:28.880 --> 00:32.840]  It's going to be a long three hours, is what I'm...
[00:32.840 --> 00:33.840]  A tight 60.
[00:33.840 --> 00:35.840]  A tight 60.
[00:35.840 --> 00:41.320]  Does dithering usually start on time, Mr. Let's Get on Skype in five minutes and takes
[00:41.320 --> 00:42.320]  eight minutes?
[00:42.320 --> 00:43.320]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:43.320 --> 00:49.040]  Dithering is the antithesis of what either of you are capable of, and it is a remarkable
[00:49.040 --> 00:50.440]  show.
[00:50.440 --> 00:54.560]  Dithering starts within a dithering of when it's supposed to start.
[00:54.560 --> 00:55.560]  Great.
[00:55.560 --> 00:58.000]  You're only ever off by 100%.
[00:58.000 --> 00:59.000]  Right.
[00:59.000 --> 01:05.560]  So we're done recording within two days.
[01:05.560 --> 01:07.200]  Yeah.
[01:07.200 --> 01:08.200]  It works.
[01:08.200 --> 01:09.200]  Hold on.
[01:09.200 --> 01:14.900]  Something that's bizarre here, because I have not been podcasting over the break, I've got
[01:14.900 --> 01:21.960]  this old Catalina system, and somehow I got an alert, like a notification that said, automatic
[01:21.960 --> 01:26.080]  updates have been turned on, which I didn't think could happen.
[01:26.080 --> 01:28.880]  I mean, if you turn them on, they turn it on.
[01:28.880 --> 01:30.240]  I didn't turn them on.
[01:30.240 --> 01:31.240]  Like a checkbox?
[01:31.240 --> 01:32.240]  Yeah.
[01:32.240 --> 01:34.240]  No, but now they're all turned on in software update.
[01:34.240 --> 01:35.880]  Hold on.
[01:35.880 --> 01:37.560]  Now that...
[01:37.560 --> 01:38.720]  I don't believe...
[01:38.720 --> 01:45.120]  Honestly, if that is a policy that Apple has adopted, you've got to scoop, because that's
[01:45.120 --> 01:46.120]  not right.
[01:46.120 --> 01:47.120]  So download, install...
[01:47.120 --> 01:49.040]  No, I don't want any of this.
[01:49.040 --> 01:50.040]  Come on.
[01:50.040 --> 01:51.040]  All right.
[01:51.040 --> 01:52.040]  All right.
[01:52.040 --> 01:53.040]  I'm recording.
[01:53.040 --> 01:54.040]  You guys are recording your end.
[01:54.040 --> 01:55.040]  Mm-hmm.
[01:55.040 --> 01:56.040]  Yeah.
[01:56.040 --> 01:57.040]  That's tight.
[01:57.040 --> 01:58.040]  Let's just...
[01:58.040 --> 01:59.040]  Yeah.
[01:59.040 --> 02:09.240]  Hey, do you know what, just to get it off the top, hey, Suki has said, happy Christmas.
[02:09.240 --> 02:11.200]  Hope you guys are doing well.
[02:11.200 --> 02:12.200]  Happy Christmas.
[02:12.200 --> 02:13.200]  Is that in Canada, too?
[02:13.200 --> 02:14.200]  That's how they say it.
[02:14.200 --> 02:16.700]  For crying out loud.
[02:16.700 --> 02:19.320]  I think it's only in Quebec, though.
[02:19.320 --> 02:20.640]  In what?
[02:20.640 --> 02:21.640]  You know what?
[02:21.640 --> 02:22.640]  Never mind.
[02:22.640 --> 02:23.640]  Never mind.
[02:23.640 --> 02:24.640]  Take it back.
[02:24.640 --> 02:25.640]  Merry Christmas to all.
[02:25.640 --> 02:26.640]  Happy Christmas to all.
[02:26.640 --> 02:27.640]  Good night.
[02:27.640 --> 02:31.000]  Well, and by the time we're done recording, it'll be your birthday.
[02:31.000 --> 02:32.240]  Sure.
[02:32.240 --> 02:35.040]  Happy New Year.
[02:35.040 --> 02:36.040]  Happy birthday, my friend.
[02:36.040 --> 02:38.560]  I thought we were saving that.
[02:38.560 --> 02:41.640]  Just so you know, Jon, I had to...
[02:41.640 --> 02:42.640]  Never mind.
[02:42.640 --> 02:44.240]  Well, what are we saving it for?
[02:44.240 --> 02:48.800]  Well, we're saving it for, I don't know, a surprise where I get to feel like the guy
[02:48.800 --> 02:52.720]  that actually knew it, and you got to be the guy that was surprised by it.
[02:52.720 --> 02:54.720]  That's a hard date to remember, I know.
[02:54.720 --> 02:56.720]  Well, do you know what?
[02:56.720 --> 03:01.200]  I texted Jon earlier, this should go in the show, I hope this goes in the show.
[03:01.200 --> 03:08.480]  I texted Jon earlier, and I'm like, my computer tells me that it's Jon's birthday today or
[03:08.480 --> 03:09.480]  tomorrow.
[03:09.480 --> 03:15.560]  And I'm not sure I believe it, because it could just be a date that got rounded off
[03:15.560 --> 03:16.560]  to like...
[03:16.560 --> 03:21.000]  That would be your extra points now if you know the Mac epoch.
[03:21.000 --> 03:22.000]  No looking it up.
[03:22.000 --> 03:23.000]  Oh, 1970s.
[03:23.000 --> 03:24.000]  Nope.
[03:24.000 --> 03:25.000]  Nope.
[03:25.000 --> 03:26.000]  Nope.
[03:26.000 --> 03:27.000]  January 1st.
[03:27.000 --> 03:28.000]  2004.
[03:28.000 --> 03:29.000]  Nope.
[03:29.000 --> 03:30.000]  1904.
[03:30.000 --> 03:31.400]  I think that's right.
[03:31.400 --> 03:32.400]  I think it's right.
[03:32.400 --> 03:34.280]  The 1904 part sounds right.
[03:34.280 --> 03:36.440]  The January 1st, I'm not sure about.
[03:36.440 --> 03:37.920]  I'm pretty sure it's January 1st, 1904.
[03:37.920 --> 03:43.080]  Well, it has to be January 1st, because honestly, I'm going to bet harder on January 1st than
[03:43.080 --> 03:44.080]  1904.
[03:44.080 --> 03:46.360]  Oh, you got it.
[03:46.360 --> 03:47.360]  January 1st, 1904.
[03:47.360 --> 03:52.440]  Yeah, and the reason, I think, I believe the backstory, I can't believe I know this, and
[03:52.440 --> 03:53.440]  it's not you.
[03:53.440 --> 04:00.720]  I believe the reason they started at 1904 instead of 1900 was, which would be a lot
[04:00.720 --> 04:04.420]  easier because then you could easily convert the...
[04:04.420 --> 04:09.440]  Remember back when we used to do dates, years as two-digit numbers?
[04:09.440 --> 04:10.880]  Just add 1900.
[04:10.880 --> 04:17.600]  But they avoided 1900 because of the weird leap year rules around centuries.
[04:17.600 --> 04:23.020]  And I know 2000 was like the super weird one, where usually if it's a century, it doesn't
[04:23.020 --> 04:30.640]  count as a leap year because it's like you only need 19 non-leap years out of a century
[04:30.640 --> 04:32.320]  to keep the earth.
[04:32.320 --> 04:33.680]  You know what I mean?
[04:33.680 --> 04:35.320]  It's like a weird thing where like 1900...
[04:35.320 --> 04:38.340]  First of all, you don't keep the earth in anything.
[04:38.340 --> 04:43.520]  You keep us aligned with the way that the earth is going.
[04:43.520 --> 04:45.360]  But yeah, definitely.
[04:45.360 --> 04:47.440]  That makes sense.
[04:47.440 --> 04:52.520]  Also, I think it's a little bit of a flipping the bird at convention.
[04:52.520 --> 04:53.520]  Yeah.
[04:53.520 --> 04:55.240]  Well, you know, so you don't run out of...
[04:55.240 --> 04:57.240]  UNIX runs out of years, you know?
[04:57.240 --> 04:58.240]  Right.
[04:58.240 --> 04:59.240]  Right.
[04:59.240 --> 05:01.240]  And then this ran out when?
[05:01.240 --> 05:02.240]  2007-ish?
[05:02.240 --> 05:05.600]  Yeah, something like that.
[05:05.600 --> 05:06.600]  I forget.
[05:06.600 --> 05:11.200]  But the basic idea was that by starting the epoch at 1904, they could have fewer leap
[05:11.200 --> 05:17.400]  year rules in the system, and it wouldn't break until 2100.
[05:17.400 --> 05:23.160]  They were ready for the year 2000, but we're not ready for the year 1900.
[05:23.160 --> 05:29.720]  Anyway, this is a Star Wars Holiday Spectacular.
[05:29.720 --> 05:33.360]  The most erratic annual, semi-annual...
[05:33.360 --> 05:34.960]  What's the word for it?
[05:34.960 --> 05:35.960]  There's bi...
[05:35.960 --> 05:36.960]  Bi-annual.
[05:36.960 --> 05:37.960]  Yeah.
[05:37.960 --> 05:38.960]  Bi-annual is what?
[05:38.960 --> 05:43.800]  Every other year or twice a year?
[05:43.800 --> 05:46.000]  Isn't bi-weekly one of those things?
[05:46.000 --> 05:47.200]  Bi-weekly is the one that means both.
[05:47.200 --> 05:48.200]  Yeah.
[05:48.200 --> 05:49.200]  Yeah.
[05:49.200 --> 05:50.200]  Let's just go with bi-annual.
[05:50.200 --> 05:51.200]  Here's the thing.
[05:51.200 --> 05:52.200]  Here's the thing.
[05:52.200 --> 05:55.320]  Do you know what we didn't talk about?
[05:55.320 --> 05:56.800]  What?
[05:56.800 --> 06:00.000]  Uh, visor Skywalker.
[06:00.000 --> 06:02.320]  Well, see, now I'm getting to that.
[06:02.320 --> 06:03.320]  We just skipped it.
[06:03.320 --> 06:04.320]  We just skipped it.
[06:04.320 --> 06:05.320]  Let me...
[06:05.320 --> 06:06.320]  There was other opportunities...
[06:06.320 --> 06:07.320]  As is appropriate, I think.
[06:07.320 --> 06:08.320]  Right.
[06:08.320 --> 06:09.320]  I think so, too.
[06:09.320 --> 06:10.320]  Let me...
[06:10.320 --> 06:11.320]  I think so, too.
[06:11.320 --> 06:12.320]  Let me get through the introduction.
[06:12.320 --> 06:13.320]  I'm sorry.
[06:13.320 --> 06:14.320]  Here's the way it goes.
[06:14.320 --> 06:15.320]  Good luck.
[06:15.320 --> 06:18.960]  It's not every year, but it's most years.
[06:18.960 --> 06:22.840]  But there is no set schedule, so it's like errata-annual.
[06:22.840 --> 06:25.080]  It's erratically annual.
[06:25.080 --> 06:30.760]  During the break between Christmas and New Year's, there's a holiday Star Wars spectacular
[06:30.760 --> 06:40.160]  episode of this podcast, and we talk about Star Wars, and we did it for The Rise of Skywalker.
[06:40.160 --> 06:41.160]  Nope.
[06:41.160 --> 06:42.160]  Nope.
[06:42.160 --> 06:43.160]  Nope.
[06:43.160 --> 06:44.160]  Nope.
[06:44.160 --> 06:46.000]  We did it for...
[06:46.000 --> 06:49.800]  We did it for...
[06:49.800 --> 06:50.800]  The Last Jedi.
[06:50.800 --> 06:56.040]  You know 1904, but you don't know the name of the second most recent Star Wars movie.
[06:56.040 --> 06:57.920]  I don't remember which one we did it for.
[06:57.920 --> 06:58.920]  The Last Jedi?
[06:58.920 --> 07:00.920]  That was the one before The Rise of Skywalker.
[07:00.920 --> 07:04.920]  I do love that he's got 1904 off the top of his tongue.
[07:04.920 --> 07:05.920]  That's pretty great.
[07:05.920 --> 07:06.920]  No.
[07:06.920 --> 07:08.080]  Well, you know what?
[07:08.080 --> 07:09.800]  This brings me to a good point, though.
[07:09.800 --> 07:14.760]  I think it's me getting older, but one of the points I want to talk about is that I
[07:14.760 --> 07:20.340]  remember the obscure names of spaceships and characters, characters who had no lines or
[07:20.340 --> 07:27.000]  no lines in English from the original trilogy, and there are major characters in The Mandalorian
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.000]  and the new Star Wars movies whose names I'll never remember.
[07:31.000 --> 07:34.040]  They're right in front of me, and then I can look away from the piece of paper and I'll
[07:34.040 --> 07:35.800]  forget them.
[07:35.800 --> 07:38.220]  So I think the 1904 thing qualifies as that.
[07:38.220 --> 07:44.840]  That got seared into my young brain, which had great memory, and the new stuff won't.
[07:44.840 --> 07:52.920]  And they have the Mac Epoch action figure from Kenner, which really cemented that.
[07:52.920 --> 07:53.920]  You know what?
[07:53.920 --> 07:57.720]  You had to get the character names right because you had to make your Christmas list.
[07:57.720 --> 08:04.920]  See, now this is where there's that massive overlap between the three of us.
[08:04.920 --> 08:07.960]  There's a lot of things we all love, and then we're all different in our own ways, but I
[08:07.960 --> 08:12.320]  feel like one way that all three of us would agree is that when you were asking for Star
[08:12.320 --> 08:21.000]  Wars toys, I made a very precise list that was unambiguous and could not possibly have
[08:21.000 --> 08:28.840]  generated any mistakes or errors in terms of, like, should the X-wing toy be the full-size
[08:28.840 --> 08:33.400]  toy that you could put the action figure in or the smaller die-cast model?
[08:33.400 --> 08:35.840]  Well, I didn't want to have any ambiguity.
[08:35.840 --> 08:40.480]  I needed the one you could put the action figures in, and so I put, like, I forget how
[08:40.480 --> 08:41.480]  I clarified it.
[08:41.480 --> 08:43.640]  You circled it in the catalog is what you did.
[08:43.640 --> 08:44.640]  Right, exactly.
[08:44.640 --> 08:45.640]  You had attachments.
[08:45.640 --> 08:46.640]  Right.
[08:46.640 --> 08:55.240]  Can I admit something that I have never admitted, even to my mother, to anybody I've ever loved?
[08:55.240 --> 09:00.360]  And since it's just the three of us here, I kind of want to get it off my chest.
[09:00.360 --> 09:07.720]  When I was very young, I guess eight, seven or eight, I was living in an apartment that
[09:07.720 --> 09:14.680]  we just moved in after we'd left England, and I wanted an add-up.
[09:14.680 --> 09:15.680]  I wanted an add-up.
[09:15.680 --> 09:17.320]  There's no shame in that.
[09:17.320 --> 09:20.440]  No, there's no shame in that.
[09:20.440 --> 09:23.360]  But John, you know me.
[09:23.360 --> 09:27.320]  The shame is coming.
[09:27.320 --> 09:37.200]  I went looking for Christmas presents in my mother's closet, and I found one.
[09:37.200 --> 09:41.520]  And it was, I forget what it was.
[09:41.520 --> 09:51.880]  It might as well have been a jigsaw puzzle of an add-at when I wanted the actual add-at.
[09:51.880 --> 09:59.200]  And I addressed it to her after having discovered it without wanting to let her know that I'd
[09:59.200 --> 10:04.080]  actually gone and found the present that I had to hope for.
[10:04.080 --> 10:12.000]  And I was like, hey, Mom, just so you know what I want.
[10:12.000 --> 10:13.840]  I want an actual add-at.
[10:13.840 --> 10:21.680]  You know, not, let's say, a jigsaw puzzle of an add-at.
[10:21.680 --> 10:23.840]  That's less fun.
[10:23.840 --> 10:25.760]  I want an add-at.
[10:25.760 --> 10:35.080]  And I was not as keenly James Bond-ish as I would have liked to have been at the age
[10:35.080 --> 10:37.680]  of seven.
[10:37.680 --> 10:40.360]  You were not suave about it, in other words, you're saying?
[10:40.360 --> 10:41.920]  No, no, not at all.
[10:41.920 --> 10:44.240]  And I still remember that look on her face.
[10:44.240 --> 10:48.640]  And I, Mom, if you listen to this, I'm so sorry.
[10:48.640 --> 10:49.880]  I did you poorly.
[10:49.880 --> 10:50.880]  I really did.
[10:50.880 --> 10:54.160]  I really did want that add-at, and you came through.
[10:54.160 --> 10:55.440]  She really did come through.
[10:55.440 --> 10:57.480]  Like I got an add-at for Christmas.
[10:57.480 --> 11:00.880]  Boy, you're rewarded for this terrible act as you get the actual add-at.
[11:00.880 --> 11:01.880]  I never got the add-at.
[11:01.880 --> 11:03.960]  I had to go over to my friend's house and play with his add-at.
[11:03.960 --> 11:05.320]  I did not get the add-at.
[11:05.320 --> 11:07.320]  I can tell you.
[11:07.320 --> 11:15.000]  This was not a great contribution to me as a human being, but it worked out in that year
[11:15.000 --> 11:16.960]  in a very small way.
[11:16.960 --> 11:20.720]  I was never a present snooper.
[11:20.720 --> 11:23.600]  I think it peaked around the age of 10.
[11:23.600 --> 11:31.560]  And I did find, I believe for my birthday, I found the BMX bike that I was getting.
[11:31.560 --> 11:33.960]  And I did go looking for it because I was so curious.
[11:33.960 --> 11:37.000]  And I realized there was no way they could really, there was only one place they could
[11:37.000 --> 11:38.000]  hide it.
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.560]  It's sort of like a sub closet at the back of the basement.
[11:42.560 --> 11:43.560]  And there it was.
[11:43.560 --> 11:45.880]  Oh, and it was beautiful.
[11:45.880 --> 11:50.700]  But the other one I found accidentally, and I don't, it was so jarring and shocking to
[11:50.700 --> 11:54.400]  me that I don't quite remember if it was a birthday or Christmas, but I suspect it was
[11:54.400 --> 12:01.440]  a Christmas, is I got the Millennium Falcon, the big Kenner, pop the top off, throw some
[12:01.440 --> 12:02.440]  characters in there.
[12:02.440 --> 12:04.580]  And it was the greatest present I ever got.
[12:04.580 --> 12:08.840]  And I kind of thought it was a stretch goal to ask for it because I don't know what it
[12:08.840 --> 12:11.600]  costs, but it seemed like insanely expensive.
[12:11.600 --> 12:13.640]  It was like, I don't know, 60 bucks.
[12:13.640 --> 12:15.080]  And it was like, what?
[12:15.080 --> 12:16.080]  And it was huge.
[12:16.080 --> 12:18.120]  It's like, ah, there's no way I'm getting that.
[12:18.120 --> 12:19.120]  But I got it.
[12:19.120 --> 12:20.120]  And it was the greatest thing ever.
[12:20.120 --> 12:21.120]  Thanks, mom.
[12:21.120 --> 12:22.120]  Thanks, dad.
[12:22.120 --> 12:23.120]  Yeah.
[12:23.120 --> 12:25.000]  I do feel like a real jerk.
[12:25.000 --> 12:29.240]  What was the best Star Wars toy you had growing up, John?
[12:29.240 --> 12:31.000]  You just mentioned that BMX thing.
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.440]  I was a present snooper, but somehow they hid my BMX bike for me.
[12:34.440 --> 12:35.520]  That might be an X bike.
[12:35.520 --> 12:40.360]  My 1984 Mongoose Californian was the best Christmas present I ever received.
[12:40.360 --> 12:46.600]  But on the Star Wars category specifically, I didn't get most of the things that I wanted.
[12:46.600 --> 12:53.320]  I did have the tie that the wings popped off and the X-wing that the character goes in.
[12:53.320 --> 13:01.080]  I also had the Death Star with the trash compactor with the square foam cubes.
[13:01.080 --> 13:03.800]  I think my best one, and these were weird, and not a lot of people had these.
[13:03.800 --> 13:05.240]  I don't know if you had these.
[13:05.240 --> 13:07.120]  Do you remember the 12-inch figures?
[13:07.120 --> 13:08.120]  Yes.
[13:08.120 --> 13:09.600]  Yes, I do.
[13:09.600 --> 13:11.920]  They were fantastic, and I had a Boba Fett.
[13:11.920 --> 13:12.920]  Oh.
[13:12.920 --> 13:13.920]  What?
[13:13.920 --> 13:14.920]  Oh, and that was cool.
[13:14.920 --> 13:19.200]  I had a Boba Fett, Darth Vader, Luke, and Leia, and the Boba Fett was obviously my favorite.
[13:19.200 --> 13:20.200]  Yeah.
[13:20.200 --> 13:22.840]  Did it have some cloth too, or was it all plastic?
[13:22.840 --> 13:23.840]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[13:23.840 --> 13:28.600]  It was before the age today of these hyper-realistic toys that look really like the thing on the
[13:28.600 --> 13:29.600]  screen.
[13:29.600 --> 13:32.260]  Obviously, the Kenner toys were great and everything, but they didn't even have elbows
[13:32.260 --> 13:36.920]  and knees that moved, and they were pretty sketchy-looking in terms of fidelity.
[13:36.920 --> 13:40.160]  And Boba Fett was cool, and I had him, not with the shooting missile, but I had the regular
[13:40.160 --> 13:41.160]  one.
[13:41.160 --> 13:42.600]  But the 12-inch Boba Fett might as well have been.
[13:42.600 --> 13:43.600]  Right.
[13:43.600 --> 13:44.600]  It was like an HD, right?
[13:44.600 --> 13:48.160]  Yes, a cloth cape, plastic head that looked like the one in the movie.
[13:48.160 --> 13:50.960]  They didn't have articulated joints either, but they were just so much bigger and more
[13:50.960 --> 13:53.600]  sort of realistic-looking.
[13:53.600 --> 13:54.600]  Very cool.
[13:54.600 --> 13:56.800]  Did you guys ever watch The Toys That Made Me?
[13:56.800 --> 13:58.280]  It's a Netflix documentary.
[13:58.280 --> 13:59.280]  Yes.
[13:59.280 --> 14:00.280]  It covers a lot of...
[14:00.280 --> 14:01.280]  Yes.
[14:01.280 --> 14:02.280]  Right.
[14:02.280 --> 14:03.280]  And they talk about G.I.
[14:03.280 --> 14:11.920]  Joe, and I think that these, like that 12-inch Boba Fett is in line of those old precursor
[14:11.920 --> 14:12.920]  G.I.
[14:12.920 --> 14:23.320]  Joe figures that were 12 inches tall, very articulated, and very much in the doll category,
[14:23.320 --> 14:24.320]  right?
[14:24.320 --> 14:25.320]  Yeah.
[14:25.320 --> 14:26.320]  Action figure, please.
[14:26.320 --> 14:27.320]  I don't like to make that distinction.
[14:27.320 --> 14:28.320]  Right.
[14:28.320 --> 14:33.560]  But here's the thing, and I don't think you believe that, is that where's the distinction
[14:33.560 --> 14:35.320]  between action figures and dolls?
[14:35.320 --> 14:36.320]  Whatever.
[14:36.320 --> 14:39.080]  You're playing with dolls, right?
[14:39.080 --> 14:50.300]  This was very much an action figure, a grossly rendered action figure, right?
[14:50.300 --> 14:53.320]  As opposed to the sort of, what are they, like the G.I.
[14:53.320 --> 14:55.360]  Joe characters are what, six inches tall?
[14:55.360 --> 15:04.120]  Like, these things were big and manipulative, and they felt more like an entity in your
[15:04.120 --> 15:10.080]  life rather than something that you could make a recreation of the eyeball with.
[15:10.080 --> 15:13.240]  Do you know what I mean?
[15:13.240 --> 15:14.240]  They were things.
[15:14.240 --> 15:18.120]  They were things that you interacted with rather than being playthings that you could
[15:18.120 --> 15:21.040]  place in a battlefield.
[15:21.040 --> 15:23.200]  I was going to bring it up.
[15:23.200 --> 15:26.720]  You said that, and it brings to mind that whoever, whichever...
[15:26.720 --> 15:32.800]  And you know it was some Don Draper, Madman type guy who came up with the phrase action
[15:32.800 --> 15:33.800]  figure.
[15:33.800 --> 15:34.800]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:34.800 --> 15:35.800]  And I get it.
[15:35.800 --> 15:36.800]  And it is funny.
[15:36.800 --> 15:37.800]  We're of a generation.
[15:37.800 --> 15:39.600]  We're now in 2020.
[15:39.600 --> 15:45.960]  We can all say, well, if your young son wants to play with dolls or your young daughter
[15:45.960 --> 15:52.960]  wants to play with army Star Wars characters with lightsabers and guns, it's all good.
[15:52.960 --> 15:54.480]  Nobody just has fun.
[15:54.480 --> 15:56.080]  You don't need to worry about words like that.
[15:56.080 --> 15:57.080]  It's all silly.
[15:57.080 --> 16:00.080]  But you know, 1978, 79, it mattered.
[16:00.080 --> 16:03.560]  We learned that from William Wants a Doll on Free To Be You and Me.
[16:03.560 --> 16:04.560]  Yeah.
[16:04.560 --> 16:05.560]  We knew.
[16:05.560 --> 16:06.560]  We knew it was right.
[16:06.560 --> 16:07.560]  I had a doll.
[16:07.560 --> 16:08.560]  I carried a baby doll.
[16:08.560 --> 16:10.760]  Her name was Kelky.
[16:10.760 --> 16:16.800]  And that was because we had a neighbor who was a few years older than me.
[16:16.800 --> 16:18.280]  Her name was Kelly.
[16:18.280 --> 16:22.380]  And I guess, you know, I had, you know, like as a young three-year-old, I had like a crush
[16:22.380 --> 16:27.040]  on her or not a crush crush, but you know, like looked up to her because she was the
[16:27.040 --> 16:28.040]  neighbor.
[16:28.040 --> 16:31.160]  Are you telling me that as a three-year-old, you didn't have a crush crush?
[16:31.160 --> 16:32.160]  No.
[16:32.160 --> 16:33.160]  You know what I mean?
[16:33.160 --> 16:34.160]  No.
[16:34.160 --> 16:36.480]  But I liked my Kelky doll more than I liked Kelly the neighbor.
[16:36.480 --> 16:40.720]  Once I had the baby doll, I mean, and I couldn't pronounce Kelly.
[16:40.720 --> 16:43.320]  So the baby was Kelky.
[16:43.320 --> 16:47.160]  And she was a little, you'll know the type of doll.
[16:47.160 --> 16:51.840]  It had a hard head and hard hands, like articulated plastic.
[16:51.840 --> 16:52.840]  But a squishy body.
[16:52.840 --> 16:54.880]  But a squishy pillow body.
[16:54.880 --> 17:00.120]  And I carried Kelky with me everywhere I went by the arm.
[17:00.120 --> 17:04.240]  And so the arm, eventually my mom had to sew the arm back on.
[17:04.240 --> 17:07.680]  And then at some point it like that wasn't working.
[17:07.680 --> 17:12.960]  And my mom, I believe, went out and bought me a replacement and I didn't fall for it.
[17:12.960 --> 17:19.560]  And you know, but my dad was very, my dad's a good man and he's still, you know, and he's
[17:19.560 --> 17:20.560]  all on board with it.
[17:20.560 --> 17:25.600]  But my dad was not a fan of, at the time, of taking me, like, let's say to the bank
[17:25.600 --> 17:26.640]  with him.
[17:26.640 --> 17:29.720]  And I would total on my Kelky.
[17:29.720 --> 17:31.920]  He needed to listen more free to be you and me.
[17:31.920 --> 17:32.920]  Exactly.
[17:32.920 --> 17:34.160]  He'd be cool with it now.
[17:34.160 --> 17:36.600]  But yeah, but I think that's true of all of us, right?
[17:36.600 --> 17:41.760]  Like I think we are in a different place now than we were when we're 20 years ago, for
[17:41.760 --> 17:42.760]  sure.
[17:42.760 --> 17:43.760]  Oh, yeah.
[17:43.760 --> 17:45.760]  But 20 years ago was the year 2000, dude.
[17:45.760 --> 17:46.760]  I know.
[17:46.760 --> 17:47.760]  I know.
[17:47.760 --> 17:54.600]  And his way I picked that is that I knew both of you 20 years ago and that's uncomfortable.
[17:54.600 --> 17:56.320]  Yeah, that's true.
[17:56.320 --> 17:59.960]  I just looked up the 12 inch bulb effect, by the way, if I had kept the box, apparently
[17:59.960 --> 18:02.680]  I could sell it for three grand on eBay today.
[18:02.680 --> 18:03.680]  Wow.
[18:03.680 --> 18:05.280]  So, so here's the thing about that.
[18:05.280 --> 18:07.040]  So this bothered me a lot though.
[18:07.040 --> 18:13.840]  And the one toy, so a massive Kenner toy that I did not want because I could just tell before
[18:13.840 --> 18:18.200]  I even saw it at a friend's house, I was like, I don't want it is I did not want the Death
[18:18.200 --> 18:25.760]  Star because the Death Star was clearly a Death Star-inspired playset where it was sort
[18:25.760 --> 18:33.120]  of like a bunch of interior sets from the Death Star, as opposed to a thing that looked
[18:33.120 --> 18:37.800]  like the Death Star that you could take a panel off and put people in.
[18:37.800 --> 18:41.800]  So the Death Star playset was a semi-sphere, basically?
[18:41.800 --> 18:43.660]  No, it wasn't even a sphere.
[18:43.660 --> 18:47.160]  It was just like a, it was just, as I recall, it was just like an apartment building.
[18:47.160 --> 18:48.400]  It was just a rectangle.
[18:48.400 --> 18:50.400]  It didn't even have any.
[18:50.400 --> 18:53.920]  My recollection was that it was just like a cutaway of a floor that bent in kind of
[18:53.920 --> 18:54.920]  an angle.
[18:54.920 --> 18:58.400]  Like it wasn't even, there was no, there was no hint that it was in a giant gray sphere
[18:58.400 --> 18:59.960]  that, I mean, they don't do that to this day.
[18:59.960 --> 19:00.960]  Look at the Lego Death Star.
[19:00.960 --> 19:04.000]  It has no relation to the actual Death Star because it's just too darn big.
[19:04.000 --> 19:05.000]  Yeah.
[19:05.000 --> 19:11.800]  The thing I'm familiar with interacting with was a semi-sphere and it had a trash compactor.
[19:11.800 --> 19:16.360]  It was all made out of cardboard.
[19:16.360 --> 19:17.680]  It was not great.
[19:17.680 --> 19:18.680]  It was bad.
[19:18.680 --> 19:24.840]  And it supports everything you're saying, but it was a specific thing.
[19:24.840 --> 19:25.840]  It was...
[19:25.840 --> 19:26.840]  Here, I just put in an iMessage.
[19:26.840 --> 19:27.840]  This is what I had.
[19:27.840 --> 19:33.680]  Trash compactor with a, what do you call it, what's the name of the monster in there?
[19:33.680 --> 19:34.680]  Oh, I forget the name of the monster.
[19:34.680 --> 19:37.200]  It begins with a D, whatever.
[19:37.200 --> 19:38.200]  Trash compactor monster.
[19:38.200 --> 19:39.200]  Yeah.
[19:39.200 --> 19:40.200]  Oh, no, it's, I got it.
[19:40.200 --> 19:42.200]  Get it in a second, hang on.
[19:42.200 --> 19:43.200]  Oh, my God.
[19:43.200 --> 19:44.200]  It's a terrible...
[19:44.200 --> 19:45.200]  It was a terrible toy, though.
[19:45.200 --> 19:46.200]  It just...
[19:46.200 --> 19:47.200]  It was just...
[19:47.200 --> 19:48.200]  You could fake it.
[19:48.200 --> 19:49.200]  You didn't need it.
[19:49.200 --> 19:50.200]  I didn't like it at all.
[19:50.200 --> 19:51.200]  Oh, man.
[19:51.200 --> 19:52.200]  This is what you had.
[19:52.200 --> 19:53.200]  Okay.
[19:53.200 --> 19:54.200]  That's...
[19:54.200 --> 19:55.200]  Yeah, that's not what I had.
[19:55.200 --> 19:56.200]  That is what I had.
[19:56.200 --> 19:59.320]  This was my biggest Star Wars toy, and honestly, I would have rather had either the AT-AT or
[19:59.320 --> 20:00.320]  the Millennium Falcon.
[20:00.320 --> 20:01.320]  Yeah.
[20:01.320 --> 20:05.760]  The Millennium Falcon was the bomb, and it even had a cool thing where the one landing
[20:05.760 --> 20:08.840]  gear was meant to be used as a pistol grip.
[20:08.840 --> 20:12.080]  You could keep it down, and then you could fly around your house, what, with the Millennium
[20:12.080 --> 20:14.760]  Falcon with this pistol grip down.
[20:14.760 --> 20:15.760]  Very fun.
[20:15.760 --> 20:16.760]  Very cool.
[20:16.760 --> 20:19.520]  But it bothered me when the toys...
[20:19.520 --> 20:25.280]  There's an uncanny valley where it's like, okay, so the original Han Solo did not look
[20:25.280 --> 20:30.160]  like Harrison Ford at all, because all of those characters, they just had a...
[20:30.160 --> 20:31.160]  The most...
[20:31.160 --> 20:32.160]  A melty, generic face.
[20:32.160 --> 20:33.160]  Yeah.
[20:33.160 --> 20:44.080]  And somebody, like some kid who's actually pretty talented, just carved a candle.
[20:44.080 --> 20:50.280]  And they had eyes that were just sort of like the eyes that you just draw as an idiot, like
[20:50.280 --> 20:55.080]  two dots and then a little upside down parenthesis, like a parenthesis for eyebrows.
[20:55.080 --> 20:56.880]  And the paint didn't land on the features even.
[20:56.880 --> 20:57.880]  No.
[20:57.880 --> 21:01.240]  Like if they had gloves or boots, it was like, eh, the paint is more or less on the boot,
[21:01.240 --> 21:03.360]  and then it kind of fades into the leg.
[21:03.360 --> 21:04.360]  Right.
[21:04.360 --> 21:07.200]  I'm looking at this 12-inch Vader again, and I realized that Boba Fett, looking at these
[21:07.200 --> 21:09.840]  pictures, Boba Fett had articulated joints, Vader didn't.
[21:09.840 --> 21:15.040]  They were hollow plastic, like Vader's arms and legs, like the whole body of least Vader
[21:15.040 --> 21:18.720]  anyway was like hollow plastic, but they didn't have elbows, but Boba Fett did apparently.
[21:18.720 --> 21:20.320]  Maybe that's why I liked him better.
[21:20.320 --> 21:27.360]  So there was a 12-inch Threepio, and a Vader, and I believe they're from 77, because I believe
[21:27.360 --> 21:34.560]  I saw them before, at a friend's house, before Empire Strikes Back came out.
[21:34.560 --> 21:39.400]  And I think that once Empire came out, it was like, well, we're going to make a bunch
[21:39.400 --> 21:42.840]  of money, so let's make these better.
[21:42.840 --> 21:45.640]  I have never seen a 12-inch Boba Fett.
[21:45.640 --> 21:49.320]  I did not know those existed.
[21:49.320 --> 21:54.780]  I knew they existed before Empire came out, because I was trying to collect enough stickers
[21:54.780 --> 21:58.720]  in order to get one with a rocket pack, and I did not.
[21:58.720 --> 22:00.240]  There were so many things that bothered me.
[22:00.240 --> 22:06.880]  It bothered me that the lightsaber characters had, instead of a lightsaber that went into
[22:06.880 --> 22:07.880]  their hand.
[22:07.880 --> 22:08.880]  That was the worst.
[22:08.880 --> 22:10.840]  That little noodle that comes out.
[22:10.840 --> 22:16.360]  And it was two different sides, and the worst part about it was, like, the lightsaber doesn't
[22:16.360 --> 22:20.600]  have one section that's thicker and then a next section that's thinner, they're uniform.
[22:20.600 --> 22:23.340]  Like, why would you do that?
[22:23.340 --> 22:25.840]  The only good thing about it was that my mother couldn't take it away, because she took away
[22:25.840 --> 22:29.720]  the guns from all my other kind of figures.
[22:29.720 --> 22:36.560]  Like, because of sort of a loose, no playing with guns policy?
[22:36.560 --> 22:39.200]  It was a very tight no playing with guns policy.
[22:39.200 --> 22:40.200]  Very tight.
[22:40.200 --> 22:41.200]  Gotcha.
[22:41.200 --> 22:47.520]  Well, seriously, sorry to create character on this, but do you resent that?
[22:47.520 --> 22:49.240]  Or do you think that was good?
[22:49.240 --> 22:50.680]  I resent it.
[22:50.680 --> 22:51.680]  Really?
[22:51.680 --> 22:56.000]  Because you're not like, I want to play with guns kind of guy.
[22:56.000 --> 23:03.360]  I wasn't big on it with my kids either, but, come on, it's Star Wars, it's fantasy violence,
[23:03.360 --> 23:08.360]  and all I did was make my own guns out of wood anyway, so I was like, you're not stopping
[23:08.360 --> 23:09.360]  anything.
[23:09.360 --> 23:10.360]  Right.
[23:10.360 --> 23:15.680]  That is so true, and I know that no guns, and I know there's guaranteed, there's way
[23:15.680 --> 23:20.320]  too many people who listen to this podcast, I know that there are literally almost, certainly
[23:20.320 --> 23:24.840]  thousands of people who are going to listen to this show who are currently raising kids
[23:24.840 --> 23:30.020]  with a no guns policy, and there are thousands who are rolling their eyes saying that's ridiculous
[23:30.020 --> 23:37.440]  and silly, and I'm just saying, however you want to raise your kids is all fine, but all
[23:37.440 --> 23:45.960]  I know is having raised a son in the last 17 years with numerous friends, it was a thing
[23:45.960 --> 23:47.520]  we would check, right?
[23:47.520 --> 23:49.600]  Friends are coming over, what's the gun policy?
[23:49.600 --> 23:52.200]  It just, you know, because you don't want any trouble.
[23:52.200 --> 23:59.800]  The kids raised in the no gun family will pick up anything and everything.
[23:59.800 --> 24:06.040]  I mean, like, oh, you know like you find like a stick on the ground that's vaguely L-shaped
[24:06.040 --> 24:08.680]  and it becomes a gun, okay, sure, I did that.
[24:08.680 --> 24:14.200]  I'm talking that the kids that Jonas grew up with in no gun families would pick up like
[24:14.200 --> 24:19.980]  a gum wrapper, like a piece of paper, and the kids would be playing something entirely
[24:19.980 --> 24:22.740]  else and then they would just fold it into a gun.
[24:22.740 --> 24:28.880]  They were nuts for making guns out of pieces of cellophane, like not sticks, leaves, just
[24:28.880 --> 24:32.240]  pick up a leaf and it would become a gun.
[24:32.240 --> 24:39.100]  And it's like, I don't want to send the kid back to his house, I presume that his parents
[24:39.100 --> 24:43.200]  knew that he was doing this, but it's like, I don't want him to think that they picked
[24:43.200 --> 24:44.200]  it up.
[24:44.200 --> 24:48.800]  You know, Jonas's dad taught me how to make a gun out of a piece of gum.
[24:48.800 --> 24:50.880]  But it's a little bit James Bond, though.
[24:50.880 --> 24:54.320]  It's the whole nature nurtures thing going on there, but like, I mean, I didn't buy my
[24:54.320 --> 24:55.860]  kids guns ever.
[24:55.860 --> 24:59.960]  But when my kids got Star Wars figures, I didn't take the tiny little guns away from
[24:59.960 --> 25:00.960]  the Star Wars figures.
[25:00.960 --> 25:02.120]  I feel like that's the right balance.
[25:02.120 --> 25:05.280]  I never wanted my kids to have guns, especially realistic guns.
[25:05.280 --> 25:09.900]  I never bought them for them, but I did buy them Star Wars action figures slash dolls.
[25:09.900 --> 25:11.960]  And if they came with guns, they came with guns.
[25:11.960 --> 25:15.520]  And it was, I think that's the right balance, because if you do a hard ban, where it's like,
[25:15.520 --> 25:19.000]  we got you a toy, but now we're removing one of the fun parts of the toy, that makes the
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.480]  kid make a gun out of a gum wrapper, maybe.
[25:21.480 --> 25:22.480]  Yeah.
[25:22.480 --> 25:24.600]  We bought Jonas all the guns.
[25:24.600 --> 25:25.960]  Really?
[25:25.960 --> 25:33.120]  He's, the only thing that kid has ever screwed him up with was really, really, really sour
[25:33.120 --> 25:34.120]  treats.
[25:34.120 --> 25:43.360]  Yeah, like, I, nobody has made me want to vomit so much as your son trying to feed me
[25:43.360 --> 25:45.240]  like a sour treat in Ireland.
[25:45.240 --> 25:46.840]  That was, that was the worst.
[25:46.840 --> 25:51.760]  Those Irish sour candies are the sourest, they're like something from Harry Potter,
[25:51.760 --> 25:54.200]  like they're magically imbued with extra sour.
[25:54.200 --> 25:55.200]  Yeah.
[25:55.200 --> 25:58.920]  No, but anyway, we bought Jonas all the Star Wars guns and in his generation, they were
[25:58.920 --> 26:02.960]  all like bright orange or green, you know, I mean, all the real guns are on computers
[26:02.960 --> 26:03.960]  now anyway.
[26:03.960 --> 26:04.960]  Yeah.
[26:04.960 --> 26:07.720]  I played Destiny with Jonas, we know where the real guns are at.
[26:07.720 --> 26:13.840]  And he's, he's a gentle soul and like, you know, it was never like a ruffhouser, it never,
[26:13.840 --> 26:19.240]  it had no bear, you know, anyway, I would recommend not worrying about it, but whatever
[26:19.240 --> 26:23.420]  you want to do, but it always anyway, long, long story short, it bothered me that their
[26:23.420 --> 26:26.960]  lightsabers were like sticks that came out of their arms.
[26:26.960 --> 26:30.240]  I always felt like that was an attempt at tapering.
[26:30.240 --> 26:33.080]  And all they could do is like,
[26:33.080 --> 26:34.640]  Yeah, the manufacturer could only make
[26:34.640 --> 26:38.680]  That precision was all they could, they could do and they would just, yeah,
[26:38.680 --> 26:41.360]  But like, they should have worried more about like length.
[26:41.360 --> 26:45.480]  Like, it was, they were, they were like a foot and a half long in scale, right?
[26:45.480 --> 26:48.080]  They were like the length of their forearm, because that's where they slid into.
[26:48.080 --> 26:51.200]  So how could you make it longer than the forearm because they slide into the forearms, which
[26:51.200 --> 26:52.200]  is bad.
[26:52.200 --> 26:55.040]  Also, the Luke, the Luke character had a yellow lightsaber.
[26:55.040 --> 26:56.600]  Yeah, it was a mess.
[26:56.600 --> 26:57.600]  Yeah.
[26:57.600 --> 27:01.300]  I mean, it was the type of thing where the toy manufacturer's like, who cares what color
[27:01.300 --> 27:02.300]  it is in the movie?
[27:02.300 --> 27:03.300]  Who cares what color it is ever like?
[27:03.300 --> 27:04.640]  And it turns out, everybody cares.
[27:04.640 --> 27:06.880]  Meanwhile, I'm five years old.
[27:06.880 --> 27:10.760]  And I'm like, have you people ever even seen this movie?
[27:10.760 --> 27:11.840]  I'm so mad about it.
[27:11.840 --> 27:12.840]  I'm still mad.
[27:12.840 --> 27:13.840]  They didn't realize this.
[27:13.840 --> 27:16.320]  This was like the movie that would literally create the first generation of people who
[27:16.320 --> 27:19.320]  would care very deeply about the color of the toys.
[27:19.320 --> 27:21.120]  In fact, too deeply.
[27:21.120 --> 27:22.960]  And I think we're going to touch on that.
[27:22.960 --> 27:25.960]  If we ever talk about what we're going to talk about.
[27:25.960 --> 27:29.620]  But there were other aspects, there were other aspects that they, this is what bothered me
[27:29.620 --> 27:33.280]  about it, was that they clearly paid attention to other details.
[27:33.280 --> 27:38.000]  So Han Solo came with the Han Solo DL-44 blaster.
[27:38.000 --> 27:42.080]  Now, see, now how do I know that his blaster was a DL-44?
[27:42.080 --> 27:45.240]  Well, first of all, it's 44.
[27:45.240 --> 27:53.720]  Again, I barely remember my own birthday anymore, but somehow DL-44, I remember it.
[27:53.720 --> 27:58.280]  And the stormtroopers came with stormtrooper little half rifles, whatever you want to call
[27:58.280 --> 27:59.280]  them.
[27:59.280 --> 28:00.280]  They had guns, right?
[28:00.280 --> 28:04.360]  And it could have easily just made like Lego, you know, the way that Lego just sort of has
[28:04.360 --> 28:09.080]  like one generic pistol and or like lightsabers, right?
[28:09.080 --> 28:15.400]  Like, so all the Star Wars figures from Lego have a generic, there's just a lightsaber
[28:15.400 --> 28:18.920]  piece, and nobody worries about whether it looks like Darth Vader's lightsaber.
[28:18.920 --> 28:21.880]  You print them out by the thousands, you stick them in boxes.
[28:21.880 --> 28:27.080]  So any of these Star Wars characters with a blaster could have had the same pistol and
[28:27.080 --> 28:28.620]  it, you know, but they got it right.
[28:28.620 --> 28:31.760]  So why in the world wouldn't you get the color of Luke's lightsaber, right?
[28:31.760 --> 28:33.440]  How can you not know he has a blue lightsaber?
[28:33.440 --> 28:35.800]  It was the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen.
[28:35.800 --> 28:42.560]  I suspect they did, and one of you is going to have to correct me on when Pantone actually
[28:42.560 --> 28:43.560]  came around.
[28:43.560 --> 28:48.520]  Because I just don't think that they could, I don't think they could dye that plastic
[28:48.520 --> 28:49.520]  that color.
[28:49.520 --> 28:50.520]  No, because-
[28:50.520 --> 28:51.520]  Yeah, yellow.
[28:51.520 --> 28:52.520]  Yeah, because Obi Wan-
[28:52.520 --> 28:53.520]  It was just blue.
[28:53.520 --> 28:56.000]  Yeah, Obi Wan had a blue lightsaber.
[28:56.000 --> 28:58.920]  Just give him, just get used to the same part from Obi Wan.
[28:58.920 --> 28:59.920]  Oh yeah, wait.
[28:59.920 --> 29:00.920]  Why was this yellow then?
[29:00.920 --> 29:01.920]  It was crazy.
[29:01.920 --> 29:04.080]  Because it wasn't, because I'm thinking of Jedi, and I'm thinking they were trying to
[29:04.080 --> 29:05.560]  do a green thing, but no.
[29:05.560 --> 29:07.040]  I mean, it matches his hair.
[29:07.040 --> 29:08.040]  I don't know.
[29:08.040 --> 29:12.820]  I just sent a picture of, apparently they did 1995 and 2019, they did reproductions
[29:12.820 --> 29:16.680]  of the original Kenner thing, and they faithfully reproduced the yellow lightsaber with a stupid
[29:16.680 --> 29:18.680]  tip on it.
[29:18.680 --> 29:31.580]  Well, anyway, it's a long, it's an erratic annual schedule, but we don't cover everything.
[29:31.580 --> 29:35.880]  We can't cover everything, and we happen to skip the Rise of Skywalker.
[29:35.880 --> 29:36.880]  We don't have time.
[29:36.880 --> 29:37.880]  There's no way.
[29:37.880 --> 29:40.000]  We're already, the introduction has taken us half an hour.
[29:40.000 --> 29:41.000]  There's absolutely no way-
[29:41.000 --> 29:50.560]  John, John, just, can we say that 1977 Luke Skywalker has a very flaccid-looking-
[29:50.560 --> 29:51.560]  It was 1977.
[29:51.560 --> 29:52.560]  It was a long time ago.
[29:52.560 --> 29:53.560]  You gotta allow for-
[29:53.560 --> 29:54.560]  It was.
[29:54.560 --> 29:55.560]  It was.
[29:55.560 --> 29:56.560]  That guy went to way too many key parties.
[29:56.560 --> 29:59.560]  In the immortal words of George Costanza, he was in the pool.
[29:59.560 --> 30:01.200]  He was in the pool.
[30:01.200 --> 30:02.200]  He was.
[30:02.200 --> 30:03.200]  Sorry, John.
[30:03.200 --> 30:07.720]  I don't want to cut you off, because we really should move on, but like, 1977 Luke Skywalker
[30:07.720 --> 30:11.120]  has definitely- You know what?
[30:11.120 --> 30:14.120]  The Obi-Wan character is all kinds of wrong, and that bothered me.
[30:14.120 --> 30:16.840]  I haven't seen this figure in a long time since I was a kid.
[30:16.840 --> 30:19.600]  Yeah, that's the one I grew up with, and that's just not Obi-Wan.
[30:19.600 --> 30:20.600]  He kind of-
[30:20.600 --> 30:22.600]  You could have done the line, but you didn't.
[30:22.600 --> 30:26.480]  He kind of looks like a kid, like a character from Flash Gordon or something.
[30:26.480 --> 30:27.480]  Yeah.
[30:27.480 --> 30:28.480]  Right.
[30:28.480 --> 30:29.480]  Very awesome.
[30:29.480 --> 30:31.680]  He's wearing some kind of maroon, 70s polyester jumpsuit.
[30:31.680 --> 30:32.680]  Right.
[30:32.680 --> 30:33.680]  Yeah.
[30:33.680 --> 30:36.920]  It's sort of like with the Obi-Wan character, it's like they found out he was an old man
[30:36.920 --> 30:40.960]  and kids weren't really going to care, and so somebody who'd never seen the movie just
[30:40.960 --> 30:43.400]  asked somebody- Jazzed him up.
[30:43.400 --> 30:44.400]  Yeah.
[30:44.400 --> 30:48.880]  It was like second or third hand, what does this Obi-Wan character look like, and then
[30:48.880 --> 30:49.880]  they made this.
[30:49.880 --> 30:50.880]  Yeah.
[30:50.880 --> 30:53.200]  They didn't even bother painting his shoes a different color.
[30:53.200 --> 30:54.760]  Do you remember touching that cape?
[30:54.760 --> 30:57.640]  His paint color just goes straight down to- I don't know if you guys ever touched that
[30:57.640 --> 30:58.640]  cape, but it's plastic.
[30:58.640 --> 30:59.640]  Oh, yeah.
[30:59.640 --> 31:00.640]  They're all plastic.
[31:00.640 --> 31:01.640]  Yeah.
[31:01.640 --> 31:02.640]  Yeah.
[31:02.640 --> 31:03.640]  All the kind of things had plastic capes.
[31:03.640 --> 31:10.440]  Anyway, so John, I cut you off to make fun of flaccid Luke, so sorry, Mark Hamill.
[31:10.440 --> 31:18.960]  So we are here to talk today about the Ewok adventure, the 1984 TV movie that I've forgotten
[31:18.960 --> 31:19.960]  even exists.
[31:19.960 --> 31:24.520]  Now, I want to talk about The Mandalorian, because I feel like we could cover that in
[31:24.520 --> 31:26.440]  a reasonable length of time.
[31:26.440 --> 31:29.840]  We can kind of tie it in.
[31:29.840 --> 31:30.840]  Yeah, it's adorable.
[31:30.840 --> 31:31.840]  Yeah.
[31:31.840 --> 31:32.840]  All right.
[31:32.840 --> 31:38.200]  It's 2020, so- Let me take a break before we even get started,
[31:38.200 --> 31:40.560]  and I will thank our first sponsor.
[31:40.560 --> 31:42.080]  It's our good friends at Squarespace.
[31:42.080 --> 31:43.080]  Squarespace.
[31:43.080 --> 31:44.560]  You guys know Squarespace.
[31:44.560 --> 31:46.440]  My God.
[31:46.440 --> 31:51.240]  It's the all-in-one site where you go to make a website.
[31:51.240 --> 31:56.920]  You just go there, and it has everything built in from registering domain names to picking
[31:56.920 --> 32:03.880]  a template from a whole wide range of templates to configuring it right there in the browser
[32:03.880 --> 32:09.520]  yourself, as you make your website, and if you want a catalog where you want to sell
[32:09.520 --> 32:14.680]  stuff and do all the commerce right there on your site, you do that, set it up in Squarespace.
[32:14.680 --> 32:16.720]  You don't have to leave Squarespace to do it.
[32:16.720 --> 32:23.680]  You want to set up a blog or a podcast, and you post the episodes right there through
[32:23.680 --> 32:25.080]  the Squarespace interface.
[32:25.080 --> 32:29.520]  It's all right there, analytics, so you can see where people are coming from.
[32:29.520 --> 32:32.240]  All of it is right there in Squarespace.
[32:32.240 --> 32:38.120]  Could not be easier to use as a totally non-technical person, but if you are technical, you can
[32:38.120 --> 32:39.120]  dig in.
[32:39.120 --> 32:43.440]  You can configure the HTML, the CSS, the JavaScript, whatever you need.
[32:43.440 --> 32:48.680]  Fantastic both if you're technically oriented and if you're not, and as I always like to
[32:48.680 --> 32:52.160]  say, if you're listening to this show, there's a good chance you're on the technical end
[32:52.160 --> 32:56.640]  of the spectrum, but people come to you when they need help with a website.
[32:56.640 --> 32:57.760]  Send them to Squarespace.
[32:57.760 --> 32:59.260]  Get them out of your hair.
[32:59.260 --> 33:00.260]  Could not be easier.
[33:00.260 --> 33:02.400]  Could not be a better solution.
[33:02.400 --> 33:03.480]  Where do you go to find out more?
[33:03.480 --> 33:07.600]  Go to squarespace.com slash talk show.

[33:09.320 --> 33:13.160]  Everybody gets that whether they come from the talk show or not, but then if you start
[33:13.160 --> 33:19.440]  at squarespace.com slash talk show, they know it's me, this show that they came from, and
[33:19.440 --> 33:22.880]  you can use the offer code talk show, T-A-L-K-S-H-O-W.

[33:27.440 --> 33:28.740]  talk show.
[33:28.740 --> 33:29.740]  Big New Year's thing.
[33:29.740 --> 33:34.240]  I'm sure that'll be a push next year, but you can get started on your New Year's resolutions.
[33:34.240 --> 33:36.240]  Build a new website.
[33:36.240 --> 33:40.600]  John, does Marco ever make you listen to the reads right there during the show, or is he?
[33:40.600 --> 33:43.800]  It always sounds to me like he pops them in after the fact.
[33:43.800 --> 33:46.680]  John Wallis, Ph.D. He'll never reveal the secrets of our program.
[33:46.680 --> 33:50.560]  Well, don't you let people just listen to it?
[33:50.560 --> 33:53.040]  Yeah, but if you don't listen live, you don't know what's happening.
[33:53.040 --> 33:56.240]  Yeah, I love that Goober is just saying you don't listen live.
[33:56.240 --> 33:59.240]  No, I stick to Canon.
[33:59.240 --> 34:00.240]  Wow.
[34:00.240 --> 34:06.240]  You're getting better at this, because that's a good segue.
[34:06.240 --> 34:09.920]  There's multiple Canon versions now, because you've got the member version.
[34:09.920 --> 34:11.400]  No, that's not Canon.
[34:11.400 --> 34:12.400]  It's very complicated.
[34:12.400 --> 34:13.400]  No, that's fancy.
[34:13.400 --> 34:16.320]  But as you know, John, no one pays for podcasts, so don't worry about it.
[34:16.320 --> 34:17.320]  Actually, wait.
[34:17.320 --> 34:20.680]  So what is the Canon version of ATP?
[34:20.680 --> 34:21.680]  They're all Canon.
[34:21.680 --> 34:22.680]  No, they're not.
[34:22.680 --> 34:23.680]  God, that's unlikely.
[34:23.680 --> 34:35.760]  Every week, we put out three Canon episodes every single week.
[34:35.760 --> 34:42.760]  Over the break, at some point in the last 10 days, we introduced Jonas to the Star Wars
[34:42.760 --> 34:43.760]  holiday special.
[34:43.760 --> 34:47.280]  This is what I wanted to ask you, John, with this birthday of yours.
[34:47.280 --> 34:51.840]  What is it like to have a birthday so close to Life Day?
[34:51.840 --> 34:53.080]  That's never come up.
[34:53.080 --> 34:57.960]  I thankfully avoided ever seeing the Star Wars holiday special, despite knowing about
[34:57.960 --> 34:59.240]  it, despite knowing about its infamy.
[34:59.240 --> 35:05.360]  I avoided it for almost my entire life until we did it on the incomparable a year or two
[35:05.360 --> 35:06.360]  ago.
[35:06.360 --> 35:08.840]  And that was the first time I'd ever seen it, and it was terrible.
[35:08.840 --> 35:13.400]  And then somehow, I erased that from my memory, and I got sucked back into doing a commentary
[35:13.400 --> 35:15.040]  track on it this year.
[35:15.040 --> 35:18.560]  So I've seen it two times, both times in the form of a podcast.
[35:18.560 --> 35:20.280]  The first time, it really, really bothered me.
[35:20.280 --> 35:22.240]  The second time, I think I was mostly numb to it.
[35:22.240 --> 35:23.240]  But it's no good.
[35:23.240 --> 35:26.480]  I was really shocked, because we're on the same slack about that.
[35:26.480 --> 35:32.360]  And when it came up the first time, I'm like, I don't want anything to do with it.
[35:32.360 --> 35:36.920]  And I think I texted you, John, and you were like, don't watch it.
[35:36.920 --> 35:38.800]  I took a bullet for you.
[35:38.800 --> 35:44.440]  And then not like a year later, you were like, ah, doing a live commentary track, and I'm
[35:44.440 --> 35:45.440]  like, what are you doing?
[35:45.440 --> 35:46.440]  I thought it was a meeting.
[35:46.440 --> 35:47.440]  It was like a COVID vaccine.
[35:47.440 --> 35:48.760]  I need two doses to truly be immune.
[35:48.760 --> 35:51.040]  Yeah, I think so.
[35:51.040 --> 35:52.040]  I think so.
[35:52.040 --> 35:54.040]  Jonas is usually pretty keyed in on this.
[35:54.040 --> 36:01.080]  He's on YouTube all the time, and he knows the Star Wars.
[36:01.080 --> 36:06.280]  And he honestly, he had sort of vaguely heard about it and wasn't even sure it was real.
[36:06.280 --> 36:08.380]  Had never seen a moment of it.
[36:08.380 --> 36:17.500]  We dialed up somebody's copy of a copy of a VHS tape, best version available on YouTube.
[36:17.500 --> 36:19.520]  Did you get the one with commercials in it?
[36:19.520 --> 36:20.800]  Yes, I believe so.
[36:20.800 --> 36:23.240]  That's the only good part.
[36:23.240 --> 36:24.620]  I had some commercials.
[36:24.620 --> 36:27.440]  We started watching it, and he couldn't believe it.
[36:27.440 --> 36:30.120]  And I remember when it came out.
[36:30.120 --> 36:31.280]  I was so excited.
[36:31.280 --> 36:33.040]  I could not believe it.
[36:33.040 --> 36:37.320]  You know, it would be a chance for more Star Wars, and it was going to be free right on
[36:37.320 --> 36:38.320]  TV.
[36:38.320 --> 36:42.000]  And then the moment it started, I realized I knew exactly what was going on.
[36:42.000 --> 36:43.000]  This is horrible.
[36:43.000 --> 36:48.600]  And it just seemed to me, the thing that was the most confusing to me, though, and it gets
[36:48.600 --> 36:53.320]  to my problem with the articulation of some of the toys, is I could have accepted more
[36:53.320 --> 36:58.360]  readily if they had also recast all of the parts.
[36:58.360 --> 37:04.480]  And there was just some other young kid playing, quote unquote, Luke Skywalker.
[37:04.480 --> 37:09.720]  And there was a man in a gorilla suit playing, quote, Chewbacca.
[37:09.720 --> 37:15.240]  But they got the actors, and Chewbacca did look like Chewbacca.
[37:15.240 --> 37:18.200]  And it was like there was the real R2-D2.
[37:18.200 --> 37:23.000]  And I couldn't understand how these people could play any part in something that was
[37:23.000 --> 37:26.000]  obviously a complete and utter fraud.
[37:26.000 --> 37:32.160]  And I don't remember really watching it to completion, but it scarred me.
[37:32.160 --> 37:38.200]  It scarred me in a way that, because it seemed incomprehensible that there could be any affiliation
[37:38.200 --> 37:41.760]  with the actual Star Wars, but there clearly was.
[37:41.760 --> 37:47.360]  And yet this was a complete horrible shot on videotape fraud.
[37:47.360 --> 37:50.480]  So wait, let's save that.
[37:50.480 --> 37:52.760]  What year did that come out?
[37:52.760 --> 37:53.760]  1980?
[37:53.760 --> 37:54.760]  No?
[37:54.760 --> 37:56.240]  No, it was before Empire.
[37:56.240 --> 37:57.240]  It was, yeah.
[37:57.240 --> 37:58.240]  It'd be like
[37:58.240 --> 37:59.240]  79.
[37:59.240 --> 38:00.240]  79, I think.
[38:00.240 --> 38:02.240]  79, yeah.
[38:02.240 --> 38:10.720]  Man, somebody do that math, because I think this goes towards the thesis statement that
[38:10.720 --> 38:11.720]  you sent me earlier, John.
[38:11.720 --> 38:12.720]  Yeah, well, okay.
[38:12.720 --> 38:13.720]  1978, Star Wars.
[38:13.720 --> 38:14.720]  1978, right.
[38:14.720 --> 38:22.560]  So what did Star Wars mean at that time, right?
[38:22.560 --> 38:30.200]  We'd had the one movie where basically a crazy old guy takes a kid and forces him to
[38:30.200 --> 38:40.120]  engage in something way beyond his pay grade, and ultimately it works out because of magic?
[38:40.120 --> 38:41.680]  It's a weird story, right?
[38:41.680 --> 38:47.040]  So is Earth Day that far off Star Wars?
[38:47.040 --> 38:51.920]  Yes, I agree, I definitely agree with you.
[38:51.920 --> 38:53.840]  They made a 70s variety show.
[38:53.840 --> 38:57.800]  Like if you're alive in the 70s, you know what they were doing, and they just shoved
[38:57.800 --> 38:59.880]  Star Wars into it, and it was bad.
[38:59.880 --> 39:08.360]  And they literally opened up the CBS Rolodex and just contacted the CBS rotary of who
[39:08.360 --> 39:09.360]  do we call?
[39:09.360 --> 39:12.120]  Well, CBS always calls B. Arthur when there's
[39:12.120 --> 39:13.640]  You got Maude there, right?
[39:13.640 --> 39:14.640]  Yeah, and if it had been
[39:14.640 --> 39:15.640]  Why wouldn't you?
[39:15.640 --> 39:16.640]  I would call B. Arthur.
[39:16.640 --> 39:19.480]  If I was going to throw in a party, B. Arthur's coming.
[39:19.480 --> 39:20.480]  Right.
[39:20.480 --> 39:25.100]  And if it had been on ABC instead of CBS, it would have been a completely different
[39:25.100 --> 39:26.100]  set of stars.
[39:26.100 --> 39:32.040]  It would have been like John Ritter from Free's Company would have been instead of B. Arthur,
[39:32.040 --> 39:33.040]  you know.
[39:33.040 --> 39:34.040]  And Harvey Korman.
[39:34.040 --> 39:35.040]  And Harvey Korman, you know.
[39:35.040 --> 39:36.040]  Art Carney.
[39:36.040 --> 39:37.040]  Right?
[39:37.040 --> 39:38.040]  That, you know what?
[39:38.040 --> 39:42.040]  That would have been a great show.
[39:42.040 --> 39:43.040]  Right.
[39:43.040 --> 39:47.320]  And if it would have been NBC, they would have got Bob Hope instead of Art Carney, you
[39:47.320 --> 39:48.320]  know.
[39:48.320 --> 39:52.440]  And, you know, all of a sudden Bob Hope is in for 30 seconds.
[39:52.440 --> 39:54.440]  Bob Hope doing Yoda would have been good.
[39:54.440 --> 39:55.440]  Yeah, but no matter what
[39:55.440 --> 39:56.440]  No, he didn't exist.
[39:56.440 --> 39:57.440]  It was on Jefferson Starship.
[39:57.440 --> 39:58.440]  Put him in there.
[39:58.440 --> 40:00.740]  Just for the name.
[40:00.740 --> 40:01.740]  It broke my heart.
[40:01.740 --> 40:03.680]  Anyway, here's my thesis statement.
[40:03.680 --> 40:04.680]  My premise for the show.
[40:04.680 --> 40:05.680]  I ran it by a guy.
[40:05.680 --> 40:10.200]  I didn't have to run it by John because I feel like you'll grok it immediately.
[40:10.200 --> 40:11.200]  Hey.
[40:11.200 --> 40:13.920]  Well, I just wanted to
[40:13.920 --> 40:14.920]  Once you said it was on
[40:14.920 --> 40:15.920]  I'm joking.
[40:15.920 --> 40:16.920]  I'm joking.
[40:16.920 --> 40:17.920]  Just go.
[40:17.920 --> 40:18.920]  I forget.
[40:18.920 --> 40:19.920]  Actually, I forget.
[40:19.920 --> 40:20.920]  I didn't write it down, so tell me if I'm getting it right.
[40:20.920 --> 40:21.920]  But basically
[40:21.920 --> 40:22.920]  You did.
[40:22.920 --> 40:25.800]  You wrote it down to me.
[40:25.800 --> 40:31.320]  Star Wars used to be, and the Star Wars that infused my vision of what it means was this
[40:31.320 --> 40:34.680]  thing that was extremely rare, extremely special.
[40:34.680 --> 40:40.640]  And they were these blockbuster, spectacular, two-hour, big-budget movies with the greatest
[40:40.640 --> 40:46.080]  special effects that blew away the second-place movies with special effects for this sort
[40:46.080 --> 40:51.800]  of thing were so far in second place, it wasn't even worth talking about them.
[40:51.800 --> 40:53.920]  And that they were like the Olympics.
[40:53.920 --> 40:55.840]  They only came out every few years.
[40:55.840 --> 41:00.360]  But at least with the Olympics, you knew there'd be one every four years.
[41:00.360 --> 41:04.840]  And then when Return of the Jedi was over, there was a question as to whether there would
[41:04.840 --> 41:09.920]  A serious, serious question as to whether there would ever be any Star Wars again.
[41:09.920 --> 41:16.920]  And in fact, there wasn't for 16 years, except for special editions.
[41:16.920 --> 41:19.540]  And it was that special.
[41:19.540 --> 41:23.120]  And then when George Lucas said, we're going to make a new trilogy, the one that was long
[41:23.120 --> 41:25.400]  rumored is going to be a prequel trilogy.
[41:25.400 --> 41:29.280]  That's why these movies were episodes four, five, and six.
[41:29.280 --> 41:31.640]  And it was like, this is going to be so great.
[41:31.640 --> 41:33.480]  This is special.
[41:33.480 --> 41:41.120]  And now we've got news announcements that there are seven different Star Wars shows.
[41:41.120 --> 41:44.720]  They make movies that they can't make movies fast.
[41:44.720 --> 41:47.260]  They can't make Star Wars movies fast enough.
[41:47.260 --> 41:54.280]  And my thesis statement is that it was good the old way when we grew up, when they were
[41:54.280 --> 41:57.040]  extremely special and extremely rare.
[41:57.040 --> 42:01.520]  But if you're going to go in a different direction and start squeezing them out more
[42:01.520 --> 42:05.360]  and into an expanded, you know, what do you call it, like the Marvel expanded universe
[42:05.360 --> 42:09.460]  and there's the Star Wars expanded universe, and you're going to just keep making stuff,
[42:09.460 --> 42:13.000]  it's better to do it like this.
[42:13.000 --> 42:17.920]  And that's why I, I, I, I'm not that big a fan of the last trilogy of movies.
[42:17.920 --> 42:23.520]  I really, this, the seven, eight, and nine, and the longer I go from them, the, the less
[42:23.520 --> 42:25.040]  of a fan I am.
[42:25.040 --> 42:29.820]  And I feel like doing these TV shows is a better way to do it under Disney stewardship.
[42:29.820 --> 42:30.820]  That's my thesis statement.
[42:30.820 --> 42:35.800]  Well, I have to say that the, the, the part that you described of when Star Wars was rare
[42:35.800 --> 42:39.360]  and everything, that's true, but I didn't super enjoy it.
[42:39.360 --> 42:41.440]  It was a lot of, a lot of tension.
[42:41.440 --> 42:45.040]  I could have done with more Star Wars, like our childhood defined, or at least mine anyways,
[42:45.040 --> 42:48.000]  defined by, by wishing that there was more Star Wars.
[42:48.000 --> 42:53.080]  We saw, you know, the, you know, A New Hope, Empire, and Return of the Jedi.
[42:53.080 --> 42:56.440]  And all we did was talk on the playground about the nine movies and the lava pit for
[42:56.440 --> 42:58.360]  like the rest of our adolescence.
[42:58.360 --> 43:02.080]  And there wasn't any more movies, and it seemed like we were waiting forever.
[43:02.080 --> 43:05.120]  And then of course we had the prequels, which were disappointing, and then we had to wait
[43:05.120 --> 43:06.120]  again, right?
[43:06.120 --> 43:12.160]  So I, I have great affection for The Force Awakens, because I felt like that was the
[43:12.160 --> 43:16.640]  payoff to a long, painful journey with Star Wars, where I felt like I wasn't getting more
[43:16.640 --> 43:19.620]  of what I wanted for a very, very long time.
[43:19.620 --> 43:24.560]  And The Force Awakens was, I think, a very good Star Wars movie that said, yes, you can,
[43:24.560 --> 43:29.520]  there will exist a new Star Wars thing that you will really like.
[43:29.520 --> 43:32.760]  And I thought The Last Jedi was okay, not as good as the other one.
[43:32.760 --> 43:35.340]  And then Rise of Skywalker we didn't talk about, and they kind of dropped the ball.
[43:35.340 --> 43:40.840]  So I agree that the, the second trilogy doesn't hold a candle to the first, obviously, and,
[43:40.840 --> 43:42.020]  but it's better than the prequels.
[43:42.020 --> 43:46.480]  But the whole about like rarity versus, you know, having more stuff, I didn't really like
[43:46.480 --> 43:47.480]  the rarity part.
[43:47.480 --> 43:48.480]  It's what we got.
[43:48.480 --> 43:51.160]  It made, you know, absence makes the heart grow fonder, right?
[43:51.160 --> 43:52.160]  All that and everything.
[43:52.160 --> 43:53.220]  That's true.
[43:53.220 --> 43:58.400]  But I would have preferred a childhood where Star Wars ended up like the MCU, right?
[43:58.400 --> 44:01.600]  And the other thing to remember about MCU, speaking of that thing, is like, the MCU,
[44:01.600 --> 44:02.600]  that's not the source material.
[44:02.600 --> 44:04.480]  The comics are the source material.
[44:04.480 --> 44:09.700]  This is derivative, the MCU, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is derivative material based on properties
[44:09.700 --> 44:12.080]  developed in comic books.
[44:12.080 --> 44:13.080]  Star Wars is not like that.
[44:13.080 --> 44:15.360]  It wasn't developed as a comic book first or whatever.
[44:15.360 --> 44:18.320]  Like it was, it was born as a movie.
[44:18.320 --> 44:20.000]  It is a movie franchise.
[44:20.000 --> 44:24.340]  So I think it's a little bit different in that you don't have, you know, 60 years worth
[44:24.340 --> 44:28.980]  of dozens of characters from which to pull and, you know, let somebody else give their
[44:28.980 --> 44:30.920]  take on Guardians of the Galaxy or whatever.
[44:30.920 --> 44:31.920]  That doesn't exist in Star Wars.
[44:31.920 --> 44:34.560]  Now, granted, there was the EU and it kind of spun out from there.
[44:34.560 --> 44:36.240]  And now they can do more picking and choosing.
[44:36.240 --> 44:41.320]  But it's just so different that I'm not sure adopting one of the formulas of the existing,
[44:41.320 --> 44:44.040]  especially things like Cinematic Universe is the right formula.
[44:44.040 --> 44:48.320]  I guess I'm agreeing with you that like, what are the, you know, Marvel on TV, I don't know
[44:48.320 --> 44:49.460]  if there's an acronym for that.
[44:49.460 --> 44:55.940]  But Star Wars on TV seems like a perfectly natural fit for me, because now we do have
[44:55.940 --> 44:58.320]  some canon to pull from.
[44:58.320 --> 45:01.620]  And the television format allows you to get what I didn't have when I was a kid, which
[45:01.620 --> 45:02.620]  is, hey, guess what?
[45:02.620 --> 45:03.620]  More Star Wars.
[45:03.620 --> 45:06.080]  And when it's a TV show, the stakes are lower.
[45:06.080 --> 45:09.400]  You make a good TV show, you make a bad TV show, whatever, there'll be another TV show,
[45:09.400 --> 45:10.400]  it's not a big deal.
[45:10.400 --> 45:14.040]  Whereas if you have, you know, one trilogy of movies every few decades, the pressure
[45:14.040 --> 45:15.040]  is on.
[45:15.040 --> 45:19.800]  And if you end up with a trilogy like the prequels, where it just kind of fizzles, and
[45:19.800 --> 45:23.280]  we end up not liking it, it's like, well, I guess I'll see you guys again in another
[45:23.280 --> 45:24.280]  decade or two.
[45:24.280 --> 45:26.480]  And that's that's not fun.
[45:26.480 --> 45:33.840]  So there were three thoughts there a, the thought that we didn't get enough is when
[45:33.840 --> 45:38.760]  we were young, and we always wanted more.
[45:38.760 --> 45:46.700]  And ending up on the thought that the MCU is a place to start the television is a place
[45:46.700 --> 45:48.120]  that we can flesh that out.
[45:48.120 --> 45:54.840]  And in the middle, there is the notion that Marvel succeeded because it had a lot of room
[45:54.840 --> 46:01.560]  to play with this stuff, and these characters in what has become a safe space, right?
[46:01.560 --> 46:08.600]  Like you can write comics, and Spider-Man can turn into a living spider and do all kinds
[46:08.600 --> 46:11.280]  of horrible, weird and insane stuff.
[46:11.280 --> 46:15.200]  And you can even get a stinker movie, you get like a Thor 2 or something, it's not a
[46:15.200 --> 46:16.200]  big deal, right?
[46:16.200 --> 46:19.560]  You just, you know, because there were so many more of them.
[46:19.560 --> 46:31.760]  And in that way, it is the finite expression of Star Wars that sort of makes a difference.
[46:31.760 --> 46:36.160]  I wanted more Star Wars when I was young.
[46:36.160 --> 46:44.160]  And I'm not sure that giving people what they want is always the best notion of making the
[46:44.160 --> 46:48.360]  most creative thing.
[46:48.360 --> 46:53.360]  And I sort of feared that this notion that like, you know, when I was young, if they
[46:53.360 --> 46:56.920]  just kept pumping out Star Wars, I'd feel awesome.
[46:56.920 --> 46:58.480]  Would you, would it mean the same?
[46:58.480 --> 47:03.560]  I mean, that's like I said, you know, it obviously looms large in our memory because there was
[47:03.560 --> 47:04.560]  so little of it.
[47:04.560 --> 47:06.120]  And because what we had was so good.
[47:06.120 --> 47:08.200]  Because we made that up, right?
[47:08.200 --> 47:12.960]  Like, I don't know about you, but I remember having arguments about like, could yoga beat
[47:12.960 --> 47:14.680]  yoga?
[47:14.680 --> 47:18.000]  Could Yoda beat the Emperor?
[47:18.000 --> 47:22.720]  And my whole notion was like, Yoda would never fight the Emperor, it wouldn't happen.
[47:22.720 --> 47:24.100]  He's beyond.
[47:24.100 --> 47:26.200]  He's just, he doesn't fight.
[47:26.200 --> 47:30.880]  He certainly doesn't light up a lightsaber and pinball all over the place.
[47:30.880 --> 47:31.880]  Like that's beneath him.
[47:31.880 --> 47:33.240]  He just doesn't do that.
[47:33.240 --> 47:37.360]  But part of the reason that prequels are so painful is it was this giant gap and the weight
[47:37.360 --> 47:38.520]  that was put on them.
[47:38.520 --> 47:41.900]  And instead, I mean, I was never into the EU.
[47:41.900 --> 47:45.840]  But during that whole time, the expanded universe was a thing and people were writing novels
[47:45.840 --> 47:48.920]  and like there was this whole world spinning out after Return of the Jedi.
[47:48.920 --> 47:51.480]  It's just that it wasn't a world that I participated in.
[47:51.480 --> 47:56.080]  So Star Wars did have its moment to like, go in a million different directions and like,
[47:56.080 --> 48:01.000]  and the reason I say I wanted more Star Wars, and I mostly mean on, you know, the movie
[48:01.000 --> 48:06.520]  screen or on television screen, as opposed to books, is because Star Wars as a universe
[48:06.520 --> 48:12.000]  as a world can support, you know, so many different stories, like so clearly, it's not
[48:12.000 --> 48:15.220]  like we were going to burn it out in the same way that superheroes is such an open ended
[48:15.220 --> 48:18.320]  thing that you can support tons and tons of heroes.
[48:18.320 --> 48:23.240]  It didn't need to be weighted so heavily with like this expectation of just there's one
[48:23.240 --> 48:26.700]  story we can tell like this, you know, there were so many stories you could tell in the
[48:26.700 --> 48:30.840]  Star Wars universe and the expanded universe told a lot of them.
[48:30.840 --> 48:33.640]  But we didn't get to see any of them in movies or on television.
[48:33.640 --> 48:36.640]  That's that's what I would like more of even if some of it was kind of stinky.
[48:36.640 --> 48:39.920]  I mean, we got we got the Ewok adventure, we got the Hollywood special, we got that
[48:39.920 --> 48:43.480]  other Ewok movie and just wasn't enough.
[48:43.480 --> 48:48.520]  Yeah, and even the books were like, so I read the Thrawn trilogy, and then a few others
[48:48.520 --> 48:53.960]  and I'm like, this is just not, it's just not, it's just not.
[48:53.960 --> 48:57.000]  I read the first one and it was like, and I did finish it.
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.360]  And it was like, man, this is this bad.
[48:59.360 --> 49:00.360]  Right.
[49:00.360 --> 49:01.360]  Put it aside.
[49:01.360 --> 49:03.920]  I mean, if you wanted more Star Wars, this is the only places you were getting it, right?
[49:03.920 --> 49:04.920]  I know.
[49:04.920 --> 49:08.880]  But do I want Star Wars at the cost of it being bad?
[49:08.880 --> 49:12.200]  And not that those books about Ken Anderson?
[49:12.200 --> 49:17.460]  And now the EU was kicked out of Canon and now it's being mined for properties to put
[49:17.460 --> 49:18.920]  back into Canon.
[49:18.920 --> 49:20.600]  Yeah, I know.
[49:20.600 --> 49:24.720]  But the providence of where good ideas from is less interesting than like, do I want to
[49:24.720 --> 49:25.720]  sit through this?
[49:25.720 --> 49:30.840]  I feel like I feel like the universe like the Star Trek universe, like these are worlds
[49:30.840 --> 49:35.200]  that can support so many different stories like you literally got a whole galaxy.
[49:35.200 --> 49:36.520]  Like I do 100%.
[49:36.520 --> 49:41.240]  This is a conversation I had with Matt Drance and Rene Richard.
[49:41.240 --> 49:42.680]  I forget who else was it.
[49:42.680 --> 49:43.680]  Maybe Melton.
[49:43.680 --> 49:44.680]  I don't know.
[49:44.680 --> 49:46.680]  Never heard of him.
[49:46.680 --> 49:47.680]  Never heard of him.
[49:47.680 --> 49:49.680]  Years ago.
[49:49.680 --> 49:57.040]  When Disney bought the rights to Star Wars, Drance was making the point, they're like,
[49:57.040 --> 49:58.960]  you know what, Star Wars is a big world.
[49:58.960 --> 50:06.120]  And my initial reaction was like, you know what, Star Wars exists to tell the story of
[50:06.120 --> 50:08.960]  Luke Skywalker in those three movies.
[50:08.960 --> 50:12.560]  It's got a beginning and an arc and an end and we should leave it at that.
[50:12.560 --> 50:21.080]  I believe, I completely agree that the universe is an exciting and an enticing premise.
[50:21.080 --> 50:23.120]  And there's a lot there.
[50:23.120 --> 50:29.720]  But it exists to tell the stories and it can't be a coherent whole without those stories
[50:29.720 --> 50:32.840]  holding it together.
[50:32.840 --> 50:33.840]  I would compare it to-
[50:33.840 --> 50:37.640]  Given that, where do we feel, given the way the Mandalorian has gone?
[50:37.640 --> 50:43.440]  Well, here's my comparison is to George Lucas's good personal friend, Francis Ford Coppola
[50:43.440 --> 50:46.120]  with the Godfather movies.
[50:46.120 --> 50:50.360]  And obviously, I mean, let's just face it, I think I bring it up every time we do one
[50:50.360 --> 50:52.200]  of these Star Wars spectaculars.
[50:52.200 --> 50:54.480]  These are kids movies.
[50:54.480 --> 51:00.520]  And a lot of this grown men arguing about Star Wars stuff, often you can pop a bubble
[51:00.520 --> 51:02.920]  by just saying, remember, these are for kids.
[51:02.920 --> 51:06.280]  And there's a reason we do this around Christmas and they come out around Christmas.
[51:06.280 --> 51:10.280]  It is a Christmas present to all of us.
[51:10.280 --> 51:14.920]  The original trilogy was for everybody, as Wave would say of Pixar movies.
[51:14.920 --> 51:15.920]  They're not for kids.
[51:15.920 --> 51:16.920]  They're for everybody.
[51:16.920 --> 51:17.920]  Sure.
[51:17.920 --> 51:18.920]  Hey, Wave.
[51:18.920 --> 51:23.160]  But that's part of what made the original Star Wars movie.
[51:23.160 --> 51:29.520]  So honestly, I don't know how else to say it other than a sort of religious experience
[51:29.520 --> 51:32.400]  for me and my friends growing up.
[51:32.400 --> 51:37.640]  And we talked about it the way that people of generations past would talk about their
[51:37.640 --> 51:39.480]  actual religion.
[51:39.480 --> 51:46.440]  But the thing that made it so fantastic to me was that it was obviously made so seriously.
[51:46.440 --> 51:48.300]  The story wasn't serious.
[51:48.300 --> 51:55.400]  The dialogue famously, as Harrison Ford said to George Lucas, George, you can't say this
[51:55.400 --> 51:56.400]  shit.
[51:56.400 --> 51:57.400]  I love that guy.
[51:57.400 --> 52:01.400]  I'd be so close, old man.
[52:01.400 --> 52:02.880]  But the production value.
[52:02.880 --> 52:03.880]  You can't write this shit.
[52:03.880 --> 52:04.880]  You can't say it.
[52:04.880 --> 52:05.880]  You can write it.
[52:05.880 --> 52:06.880]  Getting closer, getting warmer.
[52:06.880 --> 52:07.880]  What was it?
[52:07.880 --> 52:08.880]  All right.
[52:08.880 --> 52:09.880]  Correct.
[52:09.880 --> 52:10.880]  George, you can write this shit, but you can't say it.
[52:10.880 --> 52:11.880]  That's my guess as the third old man.
[52:11.880 --> 52:12.880]  All right.
[52:12.880 --> 52:13.880]  That sounds right.
[52:13.880 --> 52:17.320]  And also, that sounds better, so we'll let that stand.
[52:17.320 --> 52:22.920]  But so much work went into it, and it was so palpable, right?
[52:22.920 --> 52:29.400]  The famous opening shot right away, just boom, seriously, maybe, arguably, the best opening
[52:29.400 --> 52:32.520]  shot of any movie ever made.
[52:32.520 --> 52:36.340]  And it just immediately emphasized this is going to look real.
[52:36.340 --> 52:43.660]  This looks like a massive, kilometers-long starship chasing a little guy.
[52:43.660 --> 52:47.560]  And you could just tell by the architecture of the ships, even though they didn't really
[52:47.560 --> 52:55.800]  cheat, who was the good guy, who was the bad guy, just the amount of design, right?
[52:55.800 --> 53:00.740]  And maybe if there's anything I've been obsessed with my entire life, it's design, the amount
[53:00.740 --> 53:06.340]  of design that went into this movie for kids, whereas almost all this stuff that was made
[53:06.340 --> 53:12.860]  for kids when I grew up was clearly garbage, just like, blah, this is terrible.
[53:12.860 --> 53:18.900]  Even Disney started making animated movies where they just cheaped out on the frame rate
[53:18.900 --> 53:25.680]  and the style, and it's like 101 Dalmatians and some of those movies of that era.
[53:25.680 --> 53:28.560]  They weren't even well animated.
[53:28.560 --> 53:29.980]  It was like, ah, it's just for kids.
[53:29.980 --> 53:32.620]  Why spend all the money to do it right?
[53:32.620 --> 53:39.120]  Star Wars had this attitude that kids deserve the highest possible production values and
[53:39.120 --> 53:47.020]  special effects and articulation of the models and just developing this whole world.
[53:47.020 --> 53:49.440]  I appreciated that so much.
[53:49.440 --> 53:52.040]  The Godfather sort of had that for gangster movies.
[53:52.040 --> 53:55.800]  There's this whole world that was brought, it was so visceral.
[53:55.800 --> 54:01.360]  People still talk about it to this day, like if in some alternate universe, George Lucas
[54:01.360 --> 54:08.580]  had just locked the box after 1983 and there had never been another Star Wars movie or
[54:08.580 --> 54:15.460]  TV show and he still just had the rights the way that Coppola has to the Godfather.
[54:15.460 --> 54:19.640]  We wouldn't be having the Star Wars Holiday Spectacular right now every year, but we would
[54:19.640 --> 54:25.840]  still talk about those three Star Wars movies the way people talk about the Godfather movies.
[54:25.840 --> 54:28.740]  It would still be a thing, and that's sort of what I wanted.
[54:28.740 --> 54:36.440]  As a young kid, I wasn't allowed and I had no interest in watching the Godfather movies
[54:36.440 --> 54:42.400]  at that age, but I treated the Star Wars movies that way.
[54:42.400 --> 54:48.800]  Even as a 10-year-old had feelings about the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi that are sort
[54:48.800 --> 54:53.880]  of like people's comments on the Godfather Part 3, which is now.
[54:53.880 --> 54:58.640]  Again, we could do a whole show on the similarities, the way that Coppola keeps going back to the
[54:58.640 --> 55:03.680]  Godfather movies, the way Lucas couldn't keep his goddamn hands off the Star Wars movies.
[55:03.680 --> 55:08.240]  Well, here's where they diverged, though, because you mentioned the gangster movies.
[55:08.240 --> 55:10.960]  Organized crime movies and gangster movies obviously existed before the Godfather.
[55:10.960 --> 55:15.000]  The Godfather put a stake in the ground and said, no, no, this is how you do this.
[55:15.000 --> 55:21.360]  But the universe of Italian-American organized crime was not a universe created by Francis
[55:21.360 --> 55:22.360]  Ford Coppola.
[55:22.360 --> 55:23.600]  It was like a real-world thing, right?
[55:23.600 --> 55:30.480]  So if he just locked the box on the Godfather trilogy, he can't contain the universe because
[55:30.480 --> 55:33.560]  organized crime is a thing, and here's what we got.
[55:33.560 --> 55:36.900]  Because that's not his box to lock up, he's got those characters in that story, but the
[55:36.900 --> 55:38.800]  setting continues to exist.
[55:38.800 --> 55:43.560]  Then you get Goodfellas, which is kind of like saying, well, Star Wars was locked up,
[55:43.560 --> 55:48.040]  but the Star Wars universe is available for someone else to pick up the ball and say,
[55:48.040 --> 55:52.920]  I can make a gangster movie, I can make a Star Wars movie, and then they make Goodfellas.
[55:52.920 --> 55:55.840]  And Goodfellas is amazing, and I would not want to live in a world without it.
[55:55.840 --> 56:00.000]  And I feel like not allowing other people to make things in the Star Wars universe would
[56:00.000 --> 56:04.840]  be like not allowing anyone to make any more gangster movies after the Godfather part two.
[56:04.840 --> 56:09.440]  I think that last is a jump.
[56:09.440 --> 56:11.960]  I do.
[56:11.960 --> 56:17.280]  I'm not sure I disagree with you, but I'm not sure that I can totally get on board with
[56:17.280 --> 56:18.280]  that either.
[56:18.280 --> 56:20.920]  Yeah, because where do you put all the Battlestar Galacticas and the
[56:20.920 --> 56:21.920]  Right.
[56:21.920 --> 56:22.920]  I love Battlestar Galactica.
[56:22.920 --> 56:23.920]  Yeah, me too.
[56:23.920 --> 56:25.280]  But it wasn't in the Star Wars universe.
[56:25.280 --> 56:30.480]  No, but I mean, it exists because it was pushed out of the Star Wars universe, right?
[56:30.480 --> 56:35.520]  And I don't know if you noticed, but the Mandalorian has a bunch of Cylons coming and
[56:35.520 --> 56:36.520]  picking up baby Yoda.
[56:36.520 --> 56:37.520]  Those aren't Cylons, come on.
[56:37.520 --> 56:38.520]  Oh, come on, man.
[56:38.520 --> 56:39.520]  Those are from Dark Forces.
[56:39.520 --> 56:40.520]  We'll get there.
[56:40.520 --> 56:42.320]  We're all we're only an hour in.
[56:42.320 --> 56:43.320]  Okay.
[56:43.320 --> 56:45.040]  Come on.
[56:45.040 --> 56:48.200]  But I agree and I disagree.
[56:48.200 --> 56:55.400]  I kind of see it where Star Wars carved out this weird genre that wasn't just space
[56:55.400 --> 56:59.260]  opera shoot them up with laser guns and spaceships.
[56:59.260 --> 57:02.040]  But it was a very specific version of it, right?
[57:02.040 --> 57:04.040]  Like with lightsabers.
[57:04.040 --> 57:05.040]  And they made a universe.
[57:05.040 --> 57:09.240]  The Star Wars universe is distinct from the Buck Rogers universe or the Battlestar Galactica
[57:09.240 --> 57:12.900]  universe, even though they both look like they're space and have ILM spaceships.
[57:12.900 --> 57:18.880]  Because it's this weird meld of space opera that is a lot like on the surface.
[57:18.880 --> 57:23.000]  And if you don't really pay attention, it is a lot like Battlestar Galactica or any
[57:23.000 --> 57:24.000]  of these other things.
[57:24.000 --> 57:27.760]  I mean, the same ILM people made the spaceships in Battlestar Galactica, that's why it looks
[57:27.760 --> 57:28.760]  similar.
[57:28.760 --> 57:29.760]  Well, wait.
[57:29.760 --> 57:34.760]  So wait, specifically the Galactica thing I meant is the dark troopers look like Cylons.
[57:34.760 --> 57:35.760]  Yeah, I know.
[57:35.760 --> 57:36.760]  I know.
[57:36.760 --> 57:43.240]  I just want to delineate that for people who may think that I'm painting with a very
[57:43.240 --> 57:44.240]  broad brush.
[57:44.240 --> 57:45.240]  I'm really not.
[57:45.240 --> 57:47.760]  Now that we're talking about the Godfather and Star Wars, it occurs to me like, you know,
[57:47.760 --> 57:50.960]  the thing we always talk about with Star Wars, you know, what defines the Star Wars universe?
[57:50.960 --> 57:53.200]  It was like the dirty used future, right?
[57:53.200 --> 57:54.200]  Yeah.
[57:54.200 --> 57:58.520]  But, you know, the Star Wars, the first Star Wars movie came out in the 70s.
[57:58.520 --> 58:01.660]  Everything on screen in the movies in the 70s was dirty, you know, it was like dirty
[58:01.660 --> 58:02.660]  New York City.
[58:02.660 --> 58:07.200]  It was like, you know, like the Godfather, you know, Taxi Driver, you know, just like
[58:07.200 --> 58:08.200]  that.
[58:08.200 --> 58:10.240]  But I think that's the brilliance of it, right?
[58:10.240 --> 58:15.640]  It was like time, but it was a space movie with film grain and dirt from the 70s.
[58:15.640 --> 58:19.240]  No, because it's not an affectation.
[58:19.240 --> 58:20.240]  It's not.
[58:20.240 --> 58:21.240]  It was authentically.
[58:21.240 --> 58:22.240]  It came by it honestly.
[58:22.240 --> 58:23.240]  Exactly.
[58:23.240 --> 58:28.560]  Yeah, it came by it honestly, he's hanging out with a bunch of really nitty-gritty film
[58:28.560 --> 58:32.080]  people who did a lot of really nitty-gritty stuff.
[58:32.080 --> 58:36.840]  But he's also the guy who made American Graffiti, so it ends up being that dirty 70s, but with
[58:36.840 --> 58:40.280]  a plucky space hero blonde clown boy from Tatooine.
[58:40.280 --> 58:41.520]  But there's the insight.
[58:41.520 --> 58:42.520]  That's what we should be celebrating.
[58:42.520 --> 58:47.060]  It's like, well, what if I take the future and do it the same way?
[58:47.060 --> 58:54.120]  What if I treat the future as human and humanely as I treat the current?
[58:54.120 --> 59:01.280]  And what if I talk about the future Nazis as an analog, like why don't I do the classic
[59:01.280 --> 59:06.440]  sci-fi thing, which is talk about something that's horrific and horrible and despicable
[59:06.440 --> 59:13.100]  and project them in a light that is apropos for the time and maybe a little bit advanced
[59:13.100 --> 59:16.520]  in that I'm going to couch them in laser beams.
[59:16.520 --> 59:20.520]  And that is the value.
[59:20.520 --> 59:28.640]  That's why THX 1138 was a nice draft and Star Wars worked.
[59:28.640 --> 59:33.680]  And I think it worked because it played on that same notion and it dragged the future
[59:33.680 --> 59:35.360]  down to Earth.
[59:35.360 --> 59:44.760]  And it made sci-fi a thing that felt real, like you could reach out and touch a droid.
[59:44.760 --> 59:46.600]  You could touch R2-D2.
[59:46.600 --> 59:50.320]  You could touch certainly the Millennium Falcon.
[59:50.320 --> 59:52.800]  Chewbacca was your pet dog.
[59:52.800 --> 59:54.600]  You could do this.
[59:54.600 --> 01:00:07.120]  And yet it was divorced enough from reality to help land the narrative, the points, the
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.080]  perspective that it wanted to convey.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.120]  Now, sure, Nazis are bad.
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.280]  I hope everybody got that from Star Wars.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:15.280]  I'm not sure they did.
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:17.400]  Based on the internet, apparently not everyone.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.400]  Right, yeah, I know.
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:22.000]  But I mean, that was the point, right?
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000]  And I liked it.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  I admire it.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:32.640]  And I think that's why it still sticks with us so much, like that lived-in universe.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:36.920]  Lived-in is a word that means that we can inhabit it.
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:42.080]  I think basically, I'm convinced, the more we talk about it, I'm convinced that there
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:45.200]  were only two right ways to handle this.
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.360]  One would have been that there was...
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.600]  The good way and the wrong way.
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.800]  That's going to work out right, man.
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:54.640]  If anything Star Wars has taught us, there's light and bad and everything else.
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:02.280]  For Lucas to have made one trilogy, Star Wars, Empire, Return of the Jedi, I thought it was
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:03.280]  so awesome.
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:08.960]  It was so freaking great as a kid when they renumbered them and Empire, instead of being
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:11.400]  Star Wars II, was Episode V.
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.880]  And it just hinted at this greater story.
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:16.000]  But what if he'd never gone back?
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:24.440]  In some ways, there's an ineffable awesomeness to the fact that if the only three Star Wars
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:30.320]  pieces that ever existed were Episodes IV, V, and VI, and that was it.
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:37.120]  Or if you're going to start making more, I think the way that Disney is handling it now
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:38.760]  is the way to do it.
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:45.180]  And to give people enough Star Wars so that if a totally, just a truly bad movie comes
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:46.180]  out like Solo.
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:49.400]  Would you guys watch that?
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.520]  I would not call Solo a truly bad movie.
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.520]  We differ there.
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:53.520]  Very strongly.
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:54.520]  Okay.
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:55.520]  Well, I thought it was horrible.
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.520]  I thought it was...
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:57.520]  I'm in the middle.
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.520]  Do you see The Rise of Skywalker?
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:01:59.520]  Come on.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:00.520]  Ooh, I...
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:01.520]  Okay.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.520]  I think Solo...
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.600]  The Rise of Skywalker versus Solo.
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.600]  Which one is better?
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:07.600]  Solo.
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:10.000]  I would rather watch The Rise of Skywalker again.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  Oh my goodness.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  You need to watch Solo again.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.840]  I think your memory is warped.
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:17.640]  I remain a big fan of The Last Jedi.
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:20.920]  If anything, I've grown more fond of it over the years.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:23.280]  Well, here's my problem with these things.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.720]  And to compare them with the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.720]  My least favorite Marvel movies.
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:30.920]  And I think that the whole Marvel thing has been great.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:33.800]  I love these movies.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:38.240]  Even the ones that I'm not the biggest, that I don't love the most, I still enjoy watching
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.240]  them all.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.000]  I love the way they string together.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.280]  The ones that I like the least are the Avenger movies.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:48.120]  And especially the last few with the big guy with the magic rings.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.120]  Endgame, Infinite One.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.120]  Yeah.
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.120]  The guy with the big...
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.120]  And...
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.120]  That's awesome, man.
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:54.120]  It's Thanos.
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:59.120]  Because it's like they're trying to make this thing that's even bigger than a two-hour blockbuster
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.120]  movie, right?
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.400]  They're making this...
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:08.120]  What's even bigger than just regular old Captain America.
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:13.600]  Like the first Captain America movie, which was a swell movie and just not my favorite.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.240]  I like the Iron Man movies better.
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:18.640]  The Iron Man ones were my sweet spot.
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:22.920]  But Captain America was never my favorite hero either.
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:23.920]  But they played him straight.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.000]  They did a good job.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.520]  But they tell a story and it's sort of a movie the way you think of a movie.
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:31.180]  Whereas the Avenger ones are...
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:36.840]  And I know this gets tossed about a lot, like the Scorsese line about all of these movies.
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:40.160]  About them that they're like theme park attractions or something.
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:47.720]  But the Avenger movies, like the Endgame ones, they really are like two and a half hour nonstop
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:51.900]  roller coaster rides where it's just this nonstop blur.
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:56.600]  And there's so many, you know, even you could say, well, wow, two and a half hours is a
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:59.940]  long time for a movie or a long time for a podcast.
[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:05.920]  But it's like they were trying to cram in what easily seemed like it could be like a
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:13.360]  season of 12 hour long episodes of a show into two hours, right?
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:19.240]  And like at a pace that makes it feel like a two and a half hour trailer for something
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:23.120]  even bigger where you get to fill in all these gaps.
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.360]  And then inevitably everybody's...
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:29.720]  There's 40 different people punching each other all at the same time.
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:30.720]  And that's it.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.880]  And it's like that's just...
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:34.440]  There's only so much of that I can take.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:41.280]  And to me, the the Rise of Skywalker had a feel of that where it's just they're just
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:46.320]  mashing things together and all of a sudden they're here and all of a sudden they're there
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:50.280]  and all of a sudden the Emperor's back and...
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.280]  There you are.
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:58.160]  If you want a simple story with a clear character and arc and a series of events that culminates
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.400]  in a satisfying way, you should check out Solo.
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:01.680]  No, terrible.
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:05.080]  Okay, okay, let's just let Solo go.
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.160]  Let's let it go.
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:09.280]  We didn't convene to discuss that.
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:15.920]  Interestingly, I in a way think you're right.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:25.720]  Is Star Wars fighting with the MCU in terms of like the grandiose-ness?
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:29.520]  I think the original plan was very different from the MCU, but that's the plan that they
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:34.240]  abandoned, the original plan of we're going to have a trilogy with standalone movies in
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.240]  between.
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:36.240]  That's nothing like the MCU.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:40.400]  The MCU, we're going to have 12 movies and they're all going to be loosely connected
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.000]  and they're going to be all over the map and then we're going to have sequels to some of
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.160]  the movies within those 12 and those are connected more tightly.
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.160]  That's totally different.
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.700]  Star Wars is like, look, we're the trilogy company.
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:49.700]  We do trilogy.
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:52.920]  We did one good trilogy, we did a crappy trilogy, we're going to try to do another good one
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:55.680]  and we'll have these standalones in between and I feel like they just kind of lost their
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:00.880]  nerve like Solo's incredible failure in the market scared the hell out of them and everyone
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:07.360]  just ran for the hills and now the new strategy is we could try doing TV shows, which I think
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:09.160]  the previous strategy could have worked.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:12.440]  It would be like Marvel giving up after Thor 2 and saying we've got to scrap this whole
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.440]  plan.
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:16.120]  There's no way we're going to make 12 movies that culminated in a big Avengers movie.
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.120]  That's just not going to happen.
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.180]  Give up on it, right?
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:21.440]  So I think Disney lost its nerve, but fine, whatever.
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:25.100]  They scrapped that plan and they're onto a new plan, which is umpteen TV shows and I'm
[01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:28.520]  hoping this will keep the scaredy cats from bailing because it's like, ah, you make a
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:31.520]  bad TV show, you make a bad episode of a TV show.
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.520]  You keep trying.
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:33.520]  It's lower stakes.
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:34.520]  We've got the streaming service.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:35.800]  They cost less money.
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:42.160]  You know, like you can have a satisfying conclusion to a, you know, eight episode, uh, you know,
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.160]  series.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:46.960]  It's easier than to try to like, like John just said, to try to cram the culmination
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:50.000]  of 12 other movies into a single movie.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.560]  You can have a 12 episode season and have a satisfying season finale.
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.720]  And then you can have a season after that, right?
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:01.720]  Like, TV takes the pressure off and gives you more room to breathe and relax.
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:05.400]  Now, if Mandalorian had turned out to be like a dud in the market, what are they going to
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.400]  do?
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:07.400]  Scrap that plan and come up with another one?
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:10.840]  I feel like they need to get a little backbone at Disney and figure out what they can do
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:12.640]  with this very valuable property.
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:17.520]  Yeah, except they hit it out of the park with Mandalorian.
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:28.160]  And to John's point, maybe, uh, since he's a bit of a degenerate gambler, uh, I don't
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.160]  gamble.
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.160]  Big?
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:31.160]  Yeah.
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:32.160]  I'm sorry.
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.160]  Sorry.
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.440]  I invest in sports projections.
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:35.440]  I'm sorry.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:45.160]  I've been right next to you when you didn't gamble, um, is, is moving and it feels like
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:56.080]  if, uh, Disney is on the balls of their feet playing volleyball and tennis for the sake
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:59.760]  of Syracuse, uh, they're ready to move quickly.
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:05.420]  Have they switched to TV rather than movies?
[01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:13.680]  And if so, are they making smaller bets rather than just trying to like smash it into the
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.840]  ground and score some easy points?
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:20.720]  Are they, are they understanding that like, okay, we've got to play in a media environment
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.300]  that maybe we didn't plan before because we were Star Wars and now we're going to have
[01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:31.000]  to do these shows that are frankly as good as Game of Thrones, I think, at least in terms
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.600]  of getting attention and production quality.
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:36.600]  Is that the plan?
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:38.720]  Yeah, but slightly more kid-friendly.
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.200]  I mean, but there's still movies.
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.200]  Oh, slightly more?
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:42.200]  Slightly more?
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:43.200]  Yeah.
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:46.440]  I mean, I didn't watch Game of Thrones for the first year and a half because the very
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:55.360]  first episode saw a child thrown out of a window, incest, uh, prostitutes having sex
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:00.880]  in a barn with a, uh, it was not good.
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.600]  It was like, hey, how much HBO can we stick into one hour?
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:05.600]  Yeah.
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.520]  We've got all of the HBO and it felt, I felt insulted by it.
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:09.520]  I'm like, look-
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:13.680]  On the Thrones credit, they didn't just put that in the first episode to get people into
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:14.680]  the series.
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:15.680]  It was there the whole time.
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:16.680]  I know.
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:17.680]  They kept rolling with it.
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:21.320]  And I went back, like our friend Chris Parrish was like, no, you've just got to stick to
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:22.320]  it.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:23.320]  And I did.
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:24.320]  And it was better.
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:26.440]  But I still never got over that.
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:33.240]  Like, okay, look, you're definitely trying to HBO the crap out of me.
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:38.280]  Is the Mandalorian, I don't even know, they're definitely not trying to HBO the crap out
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:39.720]  of you.
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.640]  They're defining what Disney Plus is.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:44.880]  And I like it so far.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.400]  Is that a pivot?
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:52.400]  Is that an abdication of like, look, we can't make it on the big screen in trilogies anymore
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.840]  because that world has passed?
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:58.480]  No, no, I think they're just rebooting the movie thing, but they're taking a long break
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.000]  to rethink the movie thing.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.920]  And in the meantime, you can't let this stuff just sit there, which is the benefit of not
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:07.720]  having it owned by one person who's going to get burned out and has to have a good think
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:08.720]  for 16 years.
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:09.720]  Right?
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:12.080]  It's a whole company, there are plenty of creative people who are willing to do stuff
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.080]  in this area.
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:18.200]  So while the movie stuff is on hiatus and being sorted out, because how many different
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:19.560]  movie rumors have we heard?
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:22.480]  Speaking of Game of Thrones, the Game of Thrones guys, we're going to do a trilogy, someone
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:25.720]  else is going to get a trilogy, Ryan Johnson is going to get a trilogy and like, who knows
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:26.720]  what's happening now?
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.840]  The movie stuff is like, we're rethinking it.
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:33.800]  But in the meantime, here's a bunch of TV series, some of which are properties that
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:39.080]  were previously rumored to be movies, and we can do the TV stuff now, because it's lower
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.080]  stakes.
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:45.840]  It's cheaper, you can put them out incrementally, it's a good fit for our current COVID times
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:46.840]  rather than movies.
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.960]  And so this is all, it's a strategy shift.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:53.400]  And like I said, I don't think they should have bailed on the movie one, they just did
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:54.400]  it badly.
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.700]  But you shouldn't just give up after one mistake.
[01:10:56.700 --> 01:11:00.920]  But it turned out to, I think, be advantageous because Marvel having a bunch of movies in
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:02.720]  the can is really not helping them right now.
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.600]  Like that Black Widow movie was done like a year ago, and they're still just holding
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:06.680]  on to it, right?
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:07.680]  So yeah.
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:11.640]  I'd feel bad for Scarlett Johansson if she wasn't Scarlett Johansson.
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:15.680]  Like, not that she's wrong in any way, but it's like, come on, she's fine.
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:17.080]  It's not a big deal.
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:20.100]  But yeah, that's been in the bank for like, what, a year and a half?
[01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:21.720]  Like it feels like a long time.
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:25.720]  It's a good thing that we know people who worked really hard to get that thing finished
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:26.720]  on time.
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:27.720]  Yeah.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:28.720]  Yeah.
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:29.720]  You don't know.
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:30.720]  Hey.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.720]  Hello.
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:37.060]  I like it, and I feel like one of the things that The Mandalorian is helping to sort of
[01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:42.800]  define is, what does it mean to be a show, you know?
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:49.600]  And I forget what Kavki has called them, but like super movies or mega movies or something
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:50.600]  like that.
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:12:00.080]  But to consider a show like The Sopranos, you can't say that it's less of an artistic
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:06.400]  achievement or has lower artistic goals than a motion picture.
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:07.440]  It's of that quality.
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:12.480]  And there's so many shows that have come out in the years since that are similar.
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:21.640]  And if anything, are more adult story driven, more like the character development and plot
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:28.160]  development of something meant for adults as opposed to motion pictures, theatrical
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:33.880]  motion pictures, which have really, but they have, they've moved more towards a theme park
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:40.120]  style attraction level of, and you know, it's partly the international market that you can't
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.120]  have.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:44.320]  I think you're getting to my thesis statement though.
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:48.320]  I came into this with a thesis statement about The Mandalorian and you just came very close
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:49.320]  to it.
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:52.800]  So my statement, because I thought, silly me, I thought we were going to talk about
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.280]  season two with The Mandalorian.
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:58.640]  We'll probably talk about season two, but let me have something to say about season
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:12:59.640]  one.
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:00.640]  Here's my thought on that.
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:07.440]  Television, John just talked about it, television in recent years, like there's a dividing line
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:13.000]  where sort of the start of what we call prestige TV, Sopranos, those type of HBO shows that
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:19.400]  were more sophisticated, more ambitious and artful than TV had been before.
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:22.120]  We all kind of know what the, you know, has all sorts of different names that we can,
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:29.020]  whether it was Sopranos, Golden Age TV, Sopranos, The Wire, past 10, 15, 20 years, things you
[01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:34.360]  couldn't do on network television, weren't as formulaic, were more sophisticated, more
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:40.240]  adult views of human interactions where characters did things and had emotions that were not
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:45.480]  explicable at the most elementary level where it's like, well, there's a good guy and a
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:47.480]  bad guy and he's mean and he's angry and he's sad.
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.760]  It's like way more complicated than that.
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:52.160]  I go back to The Sopranos because it's such a great example.
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:55.600]  If you look at the, I mean, obviously there are cartoonish characters in The Sopranos,
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:01.200]  but the main characters and their actions and emotions and situation is way more complicated
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:07.040]  than a first level, a second level, a third level text, subtext is just much more sophisticated,
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:08.040]  right?
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:13.360]  So that is the big turn that television has taken in our lifetime.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:17.140]  Into that, we drop, you know, well, now we're going to do Star Wars on TV.
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:25.160]  One way they could have gone with Star Wars on TV is let's make a sophisticated adult
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.260]  version of Star Wars.
[01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:28.880]  In some respects, the movies are like that.
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:32.540]  I go back to The Force Awakens, which is a straightforward Star Wars story that hits
[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:35.880]  all the beats that you would expect, but it takes itself seriously and it tries to do
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:40.060]  serious stuff in a way that you would expect from a movie, right?
[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:46.320]  But television pre, you know, pre the golden age of TV, pre Sopranos, pre prestige TV didn't
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.320]  do that.
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:50.920]  Like if you had Star Wars on television, it's the Ewok adventure, which is less sophisticated
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:52.180]  than the original trilogy.
[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:53.180]  It's simpler.
[01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:54.180]  It's sillier.
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:55.180]  It's more pat.
[01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:56.180]  It's for television.
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:57.180]  Right.
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:02.520]  Um, but when they came to television with season one of The Mandalorian, I think they
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:07.040]  did something interesting, which is they didn't make Star Wars on TV, so it looks like Game
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:14.920]  of Thrones or, uh, or The Sopranos or Breaking Bad or any of that modern prestige TV.
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:22.400]  What they did was they made a television show that held on to the, I don't know, not the
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:27.760]  innocence, not the simplicity, but like, like they, they made a TV, they made a television
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:31.480]  show that, that had, this is going to sound bad and it's not like I'm a trash can show,
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.480]  but I'm not.
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:38.000]  There was less sophisticated than the adult fancy television shows and prestige TV.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.260]  It was structured more like, you know, a Western with a single silent character episodes with
[01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:47.640]  not a lot of dialogue, a very simple story, fairly straightforward motivation, hints at
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:50.060]  lore, a slow pace.
[01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:51.960]  It wasn't a million characters.
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:55.620]  It wasn't like you couldn't figure out what was motivating anybody.
[01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:59.180]  There was no deep angst or anguish that was constantly on screen.
[01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:07.920]  It was, everything was subtle, calm, simple, understandable, parsable, and in a way that
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:13.160]  I think subconsciously or not made people feel comfortable with the show.
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:17.680]  I mean, it was, it was a show of its time and it was good for its time as in we wanted
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:19.240]  more Star Wars.
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:21.540]  We didn't need it to be like the Avengers.
[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:27.360]  We also didn't want it to be like Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad or the Sopranos.
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:28.480]  We were, we were ready.
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:30.120]  It was, it was the right show at the right time.
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.280]  We were ready for Star Wars.
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:36.520]  It looks familiar, but it's not going to overwhelm you with 5,000 characters and tons of lore
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:42.320]  and, you know, a bunch of, you know, darkness and, you know, terrible gore and violence
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:49.460]  and just, it was, it was a breath of fresh air and, and I think they found like, it depends
[01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:50.460]  on what you like.
[01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:53.360]  If you want something that's much more sophisticated Mandalorian, isn't it?
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:57.840]  The Mandalorian, I don't think is, I think is as simple and straightforward as the original
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:58.840]  Star Wars.
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:01.640]  It's less sophisticated than Empire Strikes Back, right?
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:02.640]  Oh, definitely.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:08.260]  So that was my thesis and then I feel like season two is a good contrast to season one,
[01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:12.840]  but I think that decision for this specific show doesn't mean that's the whole TV strategy,
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:18.400]  but that decision for this specific show was very smart and I think is part of the reason
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.520]  the Mandalorian has had such a positive reaction.
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:29.840]  I agree almost entirely and I agree, I think more than you suspect because I think you
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:36.000]  struggled with the word sophistication and you see it as being an antonym for simplicity
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.040]  and I don't think it is.
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:45.020]  I think the Mandalorian is a sophisticated show and it is expressed through its simplicity.
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:50.240]  But it's not sophisticated in terms of like, adult character motivations.
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:52.740]  Adult themes and emotions in relationship.
[01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:56.040]  I mean, it's the thing you have an apple angle here that simplicity is the ultimate
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.040]  sophistication, right?
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.040]  Right.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.040]  Sure.
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:08.840]  So I'm not sitting in an all white room here, but what I'm suggesting is that you get
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:13.240]  the sense when watching the Mandalorian that they have considered that and they have rejected
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:17.520]  it rather than, hey, we're just doing a dumb show.
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:18.520]  Yeah.
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:19.520]  And the thing they did do-
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:26.560]  And it's considered simplicity rather than one that's just born out of like, well,
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:28.760]  we don't know how to do anything else.
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:33.800]  Especially in season one, because in season one it's such a clear homage to the lone
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:39.560]  silent gunman in a Western type environment, which is itself a fairly sophisticated form.
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:40.560]  Exactly.
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:44.000]  It just strikes us in this modern era, like, really, you're going to have the first three
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  episodes?
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  The guy's going to have like seven lines?
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000]  Yes.
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  Is this the show?
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.080]  And it's so shocking compared to like, the television shows that are trying to be The
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:56.120]  Avengers writ small, where it's got to be tons of characters in action and, you know,
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.240]  like think of all the superhero shows on TV, right?
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:03.680]  I just watched Wonder Woman 84 twice in 24 hours, I know.
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:04.680]  I'm sorry.
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:05.680]  Well, I had to.
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:06.680]  Well, I didn't have to.
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:10.520]  I got to talk to Don Morin and John Moles about it today.
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:12.320]  I'd rather watch the Star Wars.
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:18.320]  I swear to God, I swear to God, 20, 20 years of the year of Pedro Pascal being a dad.
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.440]  And it's weird.
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:23.200]  He's good and bad, turns out.
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:30.260]  The sophistication of The Mandalorian is that it appreciates the sophistication of everything
[01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:31.320]  that's gone before it.
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:41.520]  And it adopts that the same way that Star Wars Episode Four adopted the basics.
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:42.520]  This was the 70s.
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:47.060]  All of his contemporaries were doing really pretty deep work.
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:53.600]  And Lucas went off and made a crazy space cowboy movie, and it worked.
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:59.560]  And I think that's a little bit of the essence that's been brought forward into The Mandalorian
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:06.240]  is that I don't think you can riff on things without knowing where you're coming from,
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:07.240]  right?
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:09.880]  That's the story, Zoltus of the Hills.
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:14.960]  And I do think that Mandalorian, especially season one, knew exactly what it was doing.
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:19.400]  And I think season two has grown and is building towards something else.
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:20.400]  Let me take a break.
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.720]  We have one more sponsor.
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:26.100]  And it can coincide with the first spoiler break.
[01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:34.920]  And we'll just say, after we come back from the sponsor break, I plan to spoil lots of
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.380]  stuff for The Mandalorian.
[01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:40.480]  So up until now, I think somebody who is only Mandalorian curious could have listened to
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:41.480]  us.
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:43.100]  And perhaps we've given them a taste.
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:45.480]  After this break, spoiler's free.
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:49.080]  And there's no need for any of us to preface them.
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:54.680]  But let me thank our second sponsor here, it's our good friends at FEALS, F-E-A-L-S.

[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:31.160]  I don't think that the first episode, I went back and watched it again.
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:35.640]  They couldn't more, I don't know what they could have done in the first episode of The
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:42.160]  Mandalorian to more dramatically say this is Western inspired than if they had put a
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:45.960]  cowboy hat on top of The Mandalorian.
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:49.800]  They needed one of those squid face guys with a cowboy hat.
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:56.640]  The first scene is a lone gunslinger coming into a saloon or I guess in the Star Wars
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:23:00.440]  universe we call them cantines, cantinas.
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:05.760]  He jangles as he walks like he has spurs.
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:07.960]  It could not be more Western.
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:12.680]  But part of what makes a Western a Western isn't that it takes place in the US West.
[01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:17.440]  It's about the pace and letting things breathe.
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:21.660]  And that to me is what's missing in like the modern blockbuster movie and what makes The
[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:27.880]  Mandalorian to me so delightful is that you could just have extended sequences in a cockpit
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:35.120]  of a janky spaceship and instead of just cutting to, okay cut to where they're flying to, just
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:41.520]  have a whole scene in the cockpit where characters talk and stuff happens and you learn things
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:45.600]  and people say things and you breathe the moment.
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:49.400]  Like you said about the first Star Wars, like what a weird movie the first Star Wars is.
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:54.380]  There's like a five, ten minute stretch where you just follow a trash can robot going around
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:24:02.980]  the desert while weird little people in robes with red eyes try to steal them.
[01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:06.280]  It's a very strangely paced movie that worked.
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:11.160]  And The Mandalorian, it's not strangely paced, but it breathes.
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:19.580]  And the other thing is it's, to put it in computer terms, it's single threaded, right?
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:25.840]  And so one of the Star Wars-isms, the famous wipes that go between, oh this group's over
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:31.700]  on Dagobah and this group of characters is on Bespin and we wipe as we cut between them.
[01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:32.700]  It's single threaded.
[01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:34.080]  You don't have to worry about that.
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:40.120]  It's just, here's The Mandalorian and while he's going after him, that's it.
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:48.080]  One of the great tropes of a Star Wars movie is probably from Jedi, where it's the triple
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:50.080]  assault, right?
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:58.720]  You've got land, space, and a Jedi trying to chop somebody up.
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:02.320]  And that's basically it, you know what I mean?
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:08.080]  And I think the best execution of that was honestly Rogue One.
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:14.960]  I loved that space and ground combat was brilliant.
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:20.560]  And The Mandalorian keeps it so tight.
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:25.240]  When he's fighting one AT-ST, that's bananas.
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:29.880]  It is mind-blowing, like, oh my god, this thing is just going to murder everybody.
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:30.880]  It's a crazy thing.
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:34.360]  There's a village here, basically unarmed people, and this is a tank.
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:36.080]  How do we take out the tank?
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:41.320]  That is the kind of stakes that I really appreciate from this show.
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:44.800]  I really, really do love it.
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:49.560]  Season one, I think, was amazing.
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:55.160]  In some ways, I fear, and Suki said, I don't know how you feel about this, it felt like
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:26:03.280]  a training series of levels for a video game that we're now just starting to play in season
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:08.720]  two, where now you've got dark troopers and now you've leveled up a little bit.
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:09.720]  Oh, now you've got more money.
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:14.760]  You've got more money, you've got a jetpack, you've got stuff to play with.
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:17.480]  Because the Mandalorian, this is the first go.
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:20.280]  Is this going to work, are people going to like it, or is it going to land like Solo
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.280]  did?
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:24.080]  So you don't put all the money into it, you do the best you can, you do things on the
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:30.160]  cheap if you can with the big volume, save money where you can, indulge the people who
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:32.800]  want to make actual physical models, because whatever.
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:37.040]  But in general, I'm not saying that that's why it was a simple story, it's clear that
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:42.000]  they wanted to do what they did, but it's also clear that money was tight enough that
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.400]  it had to be won at ST because you couldn't have an army of them, right?
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:48.800]  And season two, we've got a hit on our hands.
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:51.800]  It's not like they really changed that, it was still single-threaded, each episode the
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:54.400]  Mandalorian goes to a place, meets some people, does some things.
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:59.080]  It's not like there's suddenly a hundred people in flight at the same time and armies clashing,
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:02.200]  and so it's still a very personal and private story.
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:05.080]  But in season two, you can see, oh, there's a lot more ships.
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:09.960]  Oh, they can have more than one action episode, right?
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:14.080]  The action episodes, or the scenes of action within the episodes, became more populous
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:15.800]  and frankly, better, right?
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:20.200]  So in season one, you had him hanging off the side of the sandcrawler and everything,
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:21.200]  right?
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:25.280]  In season two, you had like, legit space battles, you had space ice spiders, right?
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:29.360]  You had assaults on bases with all sorts of things.
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:33.120]  Well, Ahsoka Tano, you would not have done that in season one, because I don't think
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:40.360]  you had the knowledge, the institutional knowledge, to pull that off well.
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:44.520]  You need to know how the volume works, you need to know how everything works, you need
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:49.360]  to know how to light those swords, you need to know how to do a bunch of stuff about it.
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.240]  Did you guys watch the cartoons?
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:55.080]  So I did, because I had, you know...
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:58.960]  I think the last time we were on, John and I were imploring you to watch the old Samurai
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:27:59.960]  Jack animated ones.
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:06.480]  Oh, I did watch those too, and they were so much better than they sound.
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:14.960]  But the problem I had all along with the Clone Wars was that every season, so many of the
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:17.480]  episodes were just like...
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:23.400]  And it's so weird, because it's like, with a regular sitcom growing up, you know, like
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:28.880]  an episode of Different Strokes, it's like, you've got a cast, you've got a set, somebody
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:32.400]  writes a script, and you know, they're not all going to be good.
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:35.000]  I feel like that's the song to the Facts of Life.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.880]  But they also, you know, you've got cameras, you've got crew, and you film the episode,
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:45.080]  and there's 21 episodes a season, and you know, a bunch of them are sort of phoned in,
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:46.080]  and that's it.
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:49.440]  But like with an animated series, everything has to be drawn.
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:53.080]  It just seems like such a waste to...
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:57.820]  It seems like there's clearly more work being put into making these episodes than the writing.
[01:28:57.820 --> 01:29:01.280]  You know, there were just so many episodes that were like, why was that even a show?
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:02.280]  That was terrible.
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:08.640]  Well, I mean, the Clone Wars and Rebels and those type of shows, they were not above doing,
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:11.440]  I thought you were going to say in terms of sitcoms, they were not above doing the and
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:12.440]  everything resets.
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:13.440]  Yeah, yep.
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:17.580]  They would do a monster of the week, they would do a land on a planet, have a local
[01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:22.080]  problem, maybe hit one or two character notes for development, but otherwise, we can mostly
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:23.720]  forget that that episode happened and moves on.
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:27.660]  But the thing is, Clone Wars and Rebels didn't forget that those episodes happened, and very
[01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:32.000]  often at the end of the season, or even in a future season, hey, remember that plant
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.520]  that you landed on when that thing happened?
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:35.640]  Here's that person from that planet again, right?
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:41.960]  So it wasn't as sort of episodic as like a 70s sitcom, but it also wasn't like The Mandalorian,
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:45.820]  where it's literally like, you know, The Mandalorian is episodic, but we're following this guy
[01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:48.000]  and he's doing the thing, right?
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:53.200]  He's on a quest, he makes progress on his quest, he has sidetracks or whatever.
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:57.040]  And I think a lot of it was because those shows, first of all, they had way more seasons,
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:02.400]  and second, those were definitely more targeted at kids who would like the episode where you
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:06.840]  go on the funny planet and deal with the thing and could handle like small character development
[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:11.500]  between Ahsoka and Anakin in this one episode, but mostly it's about whatever this monster
[01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:12.840]  of the week was.
[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:16.320]  And it's the same creative team, like it's Filoni and everything, like, well, not the
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:19.720]  exact same creative team, but a lot of the same creative team doing this.
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:27.640]  And I think season two of The Mandalorian reminds me a lot more of the rhythm and pacing
[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:31.640]  of Rebels and later Clone Wars than does season one.
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:32.640]  Yeah.
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:38.800]  And I think that the other advantage that they have now, and it also showed to me in
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:46.440]  The Clone Wars, and it wasn't, it was that they clearly had their purview of what can
[01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:51.920]  you do within this period of time with these characters?
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:52.920]  Yeah.
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:53.920]  I mean, they were hemmed in.
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:56.920]  They had Anakin and Obi-Wan.
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:58.560]  You have limited flexibility.
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:30:59.560]  You're bookended.
[01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:00.560]  Right.
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:11.640]  And the next Revenge of the Sith is going to be Lucas's thing, and the Clone Wars movie
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:13.680]  was already made.
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:19.720]  And so you've just got this interstitial thing, and you can't really change the greater world,
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:23.160]  but yet we want you to make 40 or 50 of these episodes.
[01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:25.720]  What are you going to do?
[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:30.040]  And they also weren't playing with minor characters, right?
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:36.920]  And that to me is part, you know, it's not like The Mandalorian hasn't touched major
[01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:37.920]  characters.
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:44.440]  They're making the primary character not one of the, you know, it's the opposite direction
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:45.440]  of Solo, right?
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:50.600]  They took like arguably the most beloved hero from the original trilogy and made a whole
[01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:52.480]  movie just about his backstory.
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:59.280]  Here with The Mandalorian, they just took, created an all new character who exists on
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:08.960]  the outside of this realm in a period of time where it's all sort of undefined and by not
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:17.640]  making it about one of the main characters, there's so much more freedom to me, like,
[01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:18.640]  you know.
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:19.640]  Right.
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:23.680]  They learned the lesson of Ahsoka, Ahsoka and the Clone Troopers, none of which were
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:29.680]  characters in the Star Wars prequels, right, and now the most valuable properties to come
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:33.800]  out of Clone Wars is not Anakin and Obi-Wan, although they are doing an Obi-Wan show, but
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:38.960]  Ahsoka is going to get her own show and the Clone Troopers that we care about, Fives and
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:44.760]  you know, they were characters made out of nothing for the Clone Wars and those are the
[01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:48.720]  most valuable things to come out of it and yes, Obi-Wan and Anakin marched through it
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:54.360]  and Ahsoka played off Anakin in an important way, but that's, I mean, think of it this
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:55.360]  way.
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:59.480]  If Clone Wars had not introduced those new characters but merely had Obi-Wan and Anakin
[01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:03.080]  marching through the story with minor characters bouncing off them, it wouldn't have been nearly
[01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:04.080]  as good.
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:11.800]  Yeah, Obi-Wan's the Miles O'Brien of Star Wars in that that guy's just in everything
[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:16.560]  and he's kind of underappreciated in most of it.
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:28.960]  I suppose my question is, what's the, I guess...
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:31.080]  Don't worry guy, we'll edit this out.
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:38.440]  No, no, I'm trying to formulate this in a careful way.
[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:46.720]  That's the value of having them be this episodic approach as opposed to trying to wrap it up
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:52.000]  in a movie, which I think tries to get to your thesis.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:57.680]  There's certainly less risk, there's less on the line, we get to explore more common
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:08.880]  ideas, but ultimately, is the value to explore this universe that was made in imaginations
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:16.720]  from so many people over the course of our lifetimes, or is it to tell a story?
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:23.600]  And if it's to tell a story, what's that story if we're willing to just discard some episodes
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:30.360]  and be like, whatever, we're moving on and it's more of a situational storytelling endeavor
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:34.360]  rather than a narrative storytelling endeavor.
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:35.840]  I hope that makes sense.
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:43.560]  Sorry, I was trying to formulate that carefully because I think there's a distinction there.
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:49.840]  Does the world exist to explore or does the world exist to tell a story?
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:54.920]  Well, I think that's one of the mistakes that the most recent movie trilogy made was the
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:35:02.360]  movie trilogies, as established by the original trilogies, have always existed to tell a specific
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:08.040]  story, which the original trilogy did so well and so coherently, right?
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:14.200]  And arguably, even though the prequels are terrible, they also told a story.
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:19.600]  We know what the story is, they did it very badly, but it's there, all right?
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:26.360]  The third trilogy didn't seem to nail down its story at the start.
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:32.340]  So it didn't feel like they were connected to each other, but they're connected to each
[01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:36.660]  other in a wavy line that just doesn't terminate in a satisfying way, as we've established.
[01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:40.400]  And that was a big mistake, because what we're not looking for is, oh, here's three new adventures
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:41.400]  in the Star Wars universe.
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:44.160]  Because you look at the, you know, seven, eight, and nine, you're like, but you were
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:47.340]  supposed to be telling a story and you kind of flub that, right?
[01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:50.220]  So that's what I think the trilogy movies are doing.
[01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:54.940]  But writ large, I think this, as I said before, the Star Wars universe exists as a fertile
[01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:58.920]  place where you can, where anybody can tell the story that they want to tell.
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:03.000]  Like, in my past Ink Opera episodes, I was, you know, many, many moons ago, I was saying,
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.280]  if someone wants to make a horror movie in the Star Wars universe, let them.
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:08.520]  Go for it, right?
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:13.560]  Like Star Wars is not a genre, as far as I'm concerned, in terms of creative works, right?
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:17.400]  If you want, you know, we already did the Skywalker thing, and I feel like, fine, leave
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:18.480]  that alone, right?
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:21.680]  But there are tons of new stories you can tell in this universe.
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:25.560]  And it can still be Star Wars, because the universe is well established, and it will
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:26.760]  inflect your story.
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:28.040]  That's what's interesting about it.
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:33.120]  It's like telling a love story in, you know, Japan with samurai, right?
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:34.120]  Right.
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:35.480]  Love story is the genre.
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:37.840]  Japan with samurai is the setting.
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:38.840]  You can do that.
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:40.060]  And it's cool and interesting, right?
[01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:45.680]  So I say, you know, when people are going to do something, I'm going to make a TV series,
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:49.320]  I'm going to make a single movie, I'm going to make a trilogy of movies, those people
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:53.120]  should have stories they want to tell, whether it's a standalone love story or a set of three
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:56.720]  movies that connect in an arc, whatever it is, they have a story they want to tell, and
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:00.080]  they feel like this story can be best told in the Star Wars universe.
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:01.080]  That's what they're doing.
[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:05.800]  But Star Wars, as a franchise, I feel like exists for anybody who has a good story to
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:08.880]  tell that fits into the Star Wars universe to tell it.
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:12.840]  I love that.
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:18.360]  So and this is very, very, very reductive, but should I put you in the column of more
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:21.580]  TV shows and fewer movies or what?
[01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:23.880]  Like what's your, what do you follow on that spectrum?
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:30.980]  Would you like more experimentation with lower stakes or swings for the fences, basically?
[01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:35.640]  What I would personally prefer, which is not perhaps the thing that the Disney Corporation
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:40.080]  should do, is I like trilogy movies that tell a story.
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:42.760]  That is a, that is a Star Wars format that I enjoy.
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:46.800]  So if I could only pick one thing that could be Star Wars, I would say get someone to make
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:50.600]  a new Star Wars trilogy of movies and have it actually be a sensible story and do a really
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:51.600]  good job in it.
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:55.360]  That's my personal taste, but whatever, right?
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:57.440]  But I also love TV shows and watch a ton of them.
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:03.960]  Now, my personal taste in TV shows does go much more towards the, you know, Breaking
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:05.360]  Bad, The Wire, Better Cold.
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:06.360]  I know it's the way.
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:11.040]  The whole terrible, depressing, dark, quote unquote, adult.
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:13.720]  But I mean that in the not the sexy times way of adult.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:17.960]  I mean, like adult as in, again, I'm going to use the term sophisticated, but it's wrong.
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:19.680]  Like, and it's not that I don't like the simple stories.
[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:23.560]  No, adult in the way that Idris Elba is yelling at a guy for taking notes during a criminal
[01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:24.560]  fucking conspiracy.
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:25.560]  That's not adult, that's not funny.
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:28.800]  I know, I know it's not adult, but it's that.
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:34.440]  It's like, come on, that's the thing that's, that is a hilarious scene.
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:38.760]  If I look at the, if I look at the television shows that I watch and enjoy, a lot of them,
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:42.000]  most people would look at as very dark and depressing, right?
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  Sure.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.920]  But I don't think that's the right choice for Star Wars, which is why, like, like, I
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:51.320]  think there's room for that to be in Star Wars, but that would be the wrong move to
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:54.040]  come out with a Star Wars show like that, right?
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:59.880]  I certainly will not put up with the Mandalorian or even Boba Fett torturing people.
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:00.880]  I don't, I don't know.
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:05.520]  I mean, it doesn't have to be in terms of, it doesn't have to be in terms of personal
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:12.120]  violence or sex or anything like that, even just in terms of, like, having characters
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:17.320]  on the show who have so much inner mental turmoil that they are, they make self-destructive
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:18.320]  choices, right?
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:21.200]  I mean, think of something like, well, it's hard to think of, because any show that has
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:24.120]  stuff like that also ends up having, like, sex and violence, right?
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:29.960]  But like Breaking Bad, a lot of the characters in Breaking Bad have problems in their relationships
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:34.160]  with themselves and others, but then Breaking Bad also has tons of horrible violence and
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:35.160]  stuff.
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:41.760]  Arguably, Han Solo was looking to get murdered in Star Wars, the initial one, right?
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:43.880]  Like, he's down on his luck.
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:44.880]  But that's not the right tone.
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:48.000]  He's not looking to get murdered, but he's willing to just do whatever it takes, right?
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.200]  But that's not the right tone for that story that was being told.
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:53.360]  That's what I'm saying with, like, if you bring in creators.
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:58.080]  I think there's room for a creator to come and tell a super adult story in the Star Wars
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:03.080]  universe, but whoever comes in, whatever creative person comes in, they have to know what kind
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:04.080]  of thing they're doing.
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:08.040]  And Dave Filoni, I think, knows what he's trying to do, or knew what he was trying to
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:12.760]  do with Clone Wars and Rebels, and Favreau knows what he's doing with Mandalorian.
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:15.480]  And I like seeing that authorial voice.
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:19.880]  And it just so happens that their authorial voice, I think, fits very well with the Star
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:20.880]  Wars franchise.
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:22.740]  Now, there's a reason that so many people...
[01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:25.360]  To be honest, our own...
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:26.360]  It aligns with us.
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:31.280]  Well, what I was going to say, there's a reason people of our generation, and who have similar
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:36.200]  tastes to us in media, all cite Empire as our favorite Star Wars movie, because it actually
[01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:38.040]  is the most sophisticated.
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:43.720]  Its relationships are one notch, a little bit more nuanced than just, like, Luke finds
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:47.080]  the pretty princess and maybe Han is a little bit jealous.
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:49.980]  They take that one more notch of complexity.
[01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:54.720]  Instead of being middle school complexity, it's high school level romance complexity.
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:59.240]  And Luke and his father, and then I feel like Jedi, for all its Ewoks that people complain
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:03.280]  about, takes it a level farther, and see my episode where I talked about Return of the
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:10.200]  Jedi and the Incomparable, having a franchise-capping climactic movie where the hero wins through
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:17.080]  being passive and refusing to fight remains unprecedented, and is actually a way more
[01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:22.520]  complex message and story than people give it credit for now, so much so that it's essentially
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:23.520]  never been attempted again.
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:27.120]  I mean, it wasn't like Captain America was putting down his shield and refusing to fight
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:28.120]  Thanos.
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:31.700]  I mean, it's just not done.
[01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:37.520]  So you mentioned, and I agree, it actually is, and I totally did not respect it.
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:41.000]  Not that I didn't respect it.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  As a kid, when Return of the Jedi came out, I loved the opening, and I did not care for
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:58.920]  the Ewok stuff at all, and I loved the space battle, and I loved the climactic Vader-Luke-Emperor
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:00.720]  finale in the throne room.
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:06.720]  I just thought that the whole thing on Endor was like, ah, this is like 40 minutes of filler,
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:12.080]  and it's just so blatant that they just wanted to get our main characters together, and okay,
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:14.820]  the speeder bikes are cool, blah, blah, blah.
[01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:21.360]  I totally, I didn't think, oh, that sucks that Luke refused to try to fight the Emperor
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:25.120]  with his lightsaber, but I didn't respect it at all.
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:29.200]  And I agree with you, John, that in hindsight, it's remarkable.
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:34.920]  It's this movie about people cutting off arms and shooting people and blowing up things,
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:40.760]  and the true climax, and it feels, it is a natural storytelling moment.
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:45.200]  It comes about organically and feels true to all of the characters.
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:46.800]  And true to what came before it.
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:51.920]  We had three movies, like Knowledge and Defense, Never Attack, that wasn't just BS, that was
[01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:52.920]  the teaching.
[01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:53.920]  Yeah, it was earned.
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:54.920]  It was so earned.
[01:42:54.920 --> 01:43:02.300]  Yeah, and it is interesting, and to me, it helps that movie stand as a classic, helps
[01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:08.560]  the whole trilogy feel like it was tied off in a bundle, and it stands as a trilogy.
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:13.600]  And to me, too, to go back to just my opening point, that it doesn't matter how long the
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:19.160]  ongoing cinematic universe goes, and it doesn't matter what's officially canon and what's
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:24.080]  not and what used to be canon and got erased when they decided to reset it.
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:26.840]  Those three movies stand alone, and there's nothing that can come.
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:35.800]  They could make 20 seasons of The Mandalorian and make Obi-Wan and young Princess Leia and
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:36.800]  do whatever you want.
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:37.800]  Do like a whole series where...
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:40.880]  I mean, eventually, I've been saying this a few times, eventually they're going to reboot
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:44.880]  the original trilogy, you realize, and I'll be fine with that, too, because that doesn't
[01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:46.420]  take away from the original movies either.
[01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:47.420]  They're going to do it.
[01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:49.920]  They're going to cast the new Luke and Leia, and they're going to redo the trilogy, probably
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:51.200]  when we're grandparents, right?
[01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:52.600]  I don't know about that.
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:53.600]  That's a good question.
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:54.600]  Wait, so that sort of leads me to...
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:56.200]  It does lead me to the ones that they absolutely will.
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:00.480]  That leads me to something that I was going to ask previously, and eventually it's, what
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:03.680]  is it, one hour, 50 minutes, closing in?
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:07.700]  We should talk about Mandalorian season two.
[01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:11.360]  What is your pecking order in terms of canon?
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:12.740]  And I don't mean in like...
[01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:14.000]  I don't worry about canon.
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.440]  I don't worry about it either.
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:16.440]  Do you know what?
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:18.520]  If it existed in the cartoon, that's cool.
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:19.520]  I used to worry about it.
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:20.880]  If it exists in a TV show, that's cool.
[01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:23.200]  If it's in the movies, that counts.
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:25.160]  Is basically it.
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:29.440]  You know, there's been a lot of people complaining about the end of season two of The Mandalorian
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:30.440]  because...
[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:32.440]  You can say it.
[01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:33.440]  Spoilers are free.
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:34.440]  Just saying.
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:35.440]  Spoilers are free.
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:40.280]  Take the dark saber, because blah, blah, blah, Mandalorian BS code.
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:43.520]  And they were like, well, in the cartoon, somebody asks, who cares?
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:44.520]  Don't worry about it.
[01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:47.800]  There's a pecking order to this stuff, and whatever gets written later...
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:52.180]  I think it made perfect sense in The Mandalorian season two, because our character, our hero,
[01:44:52.180 --> 01:44:55.960]  is established as, we didn't know this in season one, but in season two, it revealed
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:59.120]  that, hey, you know, not all Mandalorians are as straight edge as you are about the
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:00.520]  whole helmet business, right?
[01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:01.520]  Yeah.
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:02.520]  That's one of the best things.
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:06.160]  That's one of the things I love about Worf, is whenever he interacts with Klingons, they're
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:08.880]  like, whoa, dude, you just, you got to tone down the Klingon.
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:11.360]  And in season one, you didn't realize that, you just thought they were all like that,
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:12.360]  but now you realize they're not.
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:16.320]  And so the whole rules about the, oh, well, you got to fight for him, it's no more stupid
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:21.760]  or reasonable than any of the other rules about Mandalorians, and I can imagine, you
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:25.540]  know, for who, depending on who's on either side of the dark saber, saying, oh, I actually
[01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:28.660]  take that rule super seriously, and I can't actually, you can't actually just give it
[01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:30.640]  to me because then I won't be the rightful leader.
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:33.280]  People got all sorts of BS rules for their society.
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:34.520]  And so I'm willing to let that slide.
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:36.720]  And yes, I know it was different in the in the Clone Wars.
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:38.960]  But if you don't believe in those rules, you're not bound by them.
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:40.400]  But if you do, then you are.
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:41.400]  Me too.
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:42.400]  Exactly how I feel.
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:48.000]  And you know, what I love about that is immediate and very first reaction is, well, I yield.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.700]  That's this, anyone of us would be like, I don't care.
[01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:52.700]  You have it.
[01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:53.700]  I yield.
[01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:54.700]  Okay, fine, you beat me.
[01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:55.700]  His thing was the helmet.
[01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:58.880]  And he already got over that because he had, he was forced a couple episodes earlier to
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:01.960]  make a choice, like, do you care more about the helmet rules, do you care more about saving
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:02.960]  the child?
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:03.960]  And he made his choice.
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:04.960]  Exactly.
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:05.960]  He's like, I don't care.
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:06.960]  This is yours.
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:07.960]  I yield.
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:13.100]  I don't need my ego to fight over this dumb thing that I got off this asshole that was
[01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:14.200]  going to kill a kid.
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:17.440]  So he's not interested in going trying to blow up the Death Star too, right?
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:18.440]  No.
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:19.640]  And if anything, he's frustrated about it.
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:20.640]  Just take it.
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:22.920]  I don't want any part of any of this.
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:26.960]  And this crazy wizard guy that just came in and chopped up a whole bunch of Cylons.
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:29.140]  That guy's kind of spooky.
[01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:32.360]  And he just took my kid.
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:35.520]  There's a scene in the first season that bothered me.
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:38.160]  But in hindsight, now I realized they were right.
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:39.440]  I like it.
[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:44.280]  And the further development of the Mandalorian character says to me that it actually was
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:45.280]  right.
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:46.800]  But it's the scene, it might have been the first episode, I don't know.
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:52.440]  But it was early on, you mentioned it, where he somehow gets caught up with some Jawas
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:58.760]  and the Jawas steal his stuff and then he gets him back.
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:00.600]  But he doesn't kill all the Jawas.
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:03.080]  And I was like, come on, this guy.
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:09.240]  And it's because I was reading too much into what I thought the Mandalorian was.
[01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:10.240]  And he was.
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:14.160]  He was a badass when he was going after one of his targets.
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:20.800]  But it turns out that not killing those Jawas for stealing his stuff was definitely correct
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:22.240]  for this character.
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:24.400]  And that would have been a darker take on this.
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:26.220]  I was thinking about that the other day.
[01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:31.320]  So the first episode of the season one of The Mandalorian, our bounty hunter is faced
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:33.680]  with the situation where he's got to kill this cute little thing.
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:34.680]  And is he going to do it or not?
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:38.080]  It turns out he saves the cute little thing instead of killing it.
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:39.080]  The way...
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:44.480]  Just for any listeners out there, if you got a choice between shooting a baby and a robot,
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:45.480]  shoot the robot.
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:46.480]  Shoot the robot every time.
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:47.720]  It was a murderous robot.
[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:49.720]  It wasn't just a bystander.
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:50.720]  I don't care.
[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:51.720]  Shoot the robot.
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:52.720]  You can build another robot.
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:53.720]  Come on.
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:57.800]  The more conventional way to do this character in the modern era of television is to have
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:04.360]  a previous series of events where The Mandalorian is established as somebody who does hew to
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:10.700]  the bounty hunter code by showing a situation where he is told to bring in a sympathetic
[01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:14.440]  character dead or alive and ends up killing him.
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:18.880]  And we see him do that like, oh, this guy's the anti-hero thing.
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:20.000]  He's a little bit of a bad guy.
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:23.120]  He has a code and maybe he didn't want to kill a guy who was like, well, I'm a bounty
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:24.120]  hunter.
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:25.120]  I got to do what I got to do.
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:26.120]  And I kill him.
[01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:30.620]  And then when he's faced with Baby Yoda, he's like, okay, well, now I make a different choice.
[01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:31.880]  But The Mandalorian doesn't do that.
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:38.280]  The Mandalorian says from season one, episode one, this guy's got a gruff exterior, but
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:39.280]  he's a softy.
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:40.760]  He knows right from wrong.
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:42.060]  He's had a hard life.
[01:48:42.060 --> 01:48:43.380]  He puts on a hard front.
[01:48:43.380 --> 01:48:44.740]  He's a great fighter.
[01:48:44.740 --> 01:48:48.000]  But there isn't the episode where he kills the Baby Yoda and then has second choices
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.720]  about the second and is haunted by it and then makes a different choice on the second
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:51.720]  Baby Yoda.
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:54.400]  He's good from the jump, right?
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:59.600]  I agree with you so much because the Horatio Sans character, the blue guy that they meet
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:03.280]  in the bar, it's like, I can bring you in warm or cold.
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:07.360]  And then he's an idiot and he goes messing around with things.
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:10.600]  And it's like, yeah, he turns up cold, but he's not dead.
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:12.120]  He's just frozen in carbonite.
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:13.120]  Like that's...
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:14.480]  It'll be back in season two and they'll be friends.
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:19.280]  And that's part of the family-friendly nature of the show, and it's part of also understanding
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:24.200]  that you can have a character who has to do a job and is conflicted and has character
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:29.360]  development and moments without first putting them into the super-duper antihero thing.
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:34.080]  The farthest Star Wars is ever done in that, famously, is Han Solo shooting Greedo first,
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:39.760]  which is the hardest core arc that you get of like, we know Han is good-hearted, but
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:44.020]  we also, the first thing we see him do, I mean, granted, it's self-defense, but we don't
[01:49:44.020 --> 01:49:46.200]  see him find a non-violent way out of that situation.
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:50.680]  I feel like that's why Lucas regretted that and keeps trying to mess with it or whatever.
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:55.360]  And I think that a little harder edge helps in an otherwise fairly fluffy movie, but the
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:00.240]  Mandalorian clearly, they want you to know this character, this character has inner turmoil
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:06.600]  and everything, but we are on the Mandalorian side from the very beginning and we feel his
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:10.400]  struggles as he goes on with his whole code and his helmet and the people and the kid
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:13.240]  and whatever, but we always know in his heart that he's good.
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:23.440]  Yeah, I think, I forgive Spielberg and Lucas for their re-examination of the violence that
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:28.320]  they visited in those earlier films.
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:32.640]  It is unfortunate that you can reach back into history and to change things, but I understand
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:36.580]  that they've moved their perspective and now they don't want their hero to shoot people
[01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:41.880]  or the bad guys in E.T. to be carrying guns and now you get walkie-talkies.
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:52.600]  I think it's a mistake and I reject the revisionism of it, but I understand the evolving nuance
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:54.820]  because I think we've changed too, right?
[01:50:54.820 --> 01:51:05.600]  Like if we'd made something in an earlier period, I think whatever work you make, it's
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:08.200]  a part of the period in which it's made, right?
[01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:10.000]  You build things within the culture.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.720]  Yeah, the solution is to make new things, not to go back and change the old ones.
[01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:14.720]  Exactly.
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:15.720]  You're not actually changing anything.
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:19.360]  We know you made the old thing the other way, and honestly, Han shooting first is in a life
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:23.680]  or death situation anyway, where a Greedo basis is going to kill him, is totally justified
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:27.920]  and perfectly fine, and it's not like Han is a super hard-edged thing, you know?
[01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:32.120]  As soon as we see him, his guard down, these guys must really be desperate when he says
[01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:33.920]  that he sounds like a little kid.
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:34.920]  Exactly.
[01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:39.760]  And so that's what, sorry, just to finish that thought, that's why I like The Mandalorian
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:42.920]  as that is the way you address that.
[01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:48.000]  You have a character that's a total badass and his version of like, I can bring in warm
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  or cold.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.880]  It's like, well, you're still going to be alive.
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:51.880]  I'm not going to kill you.
[01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:52.880]  Come on.
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:53.880]  What am I, a jerk?
[01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:54.880]  He doesn't want to kill you.
[01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:55.880]  He doesn't want to kill you.
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:57.040]  He will if he has to.
[01:51:57.040 --> 01:52:01.680]  He kills plenty of people on this show, but it's not his preferred course.
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:04.840]  As we reveal his backstory, he's had a difficult life.
[01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:08.520]  The droids came and killed his parents, he got adopted by these Mandalorians that had
[01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:11.360]  the strict code, he had to learn to be a fighter.
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:16.360]  But he doesn't, like, if he had grown up in luxury and not had to worry about this
[01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:19.440]  whole situation, he would not have ended up as a bounty hunter, for sure.
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:20.440]  Right.
[01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:22.040]  And even then, he comes to love droids.
[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:27.800]  Episode one of season two, he's like, you know what, let those stupid droids just go
[01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:28.800]  up my ship.
[01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:29.800]  That's fine.
[01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:32.560]  But they're not going to, you know.
[01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:37.500]  My Han and Greedo analogy is that Lucas went back to that scene as though, imagine if the
[01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:41.000]  original scene had been Han was on his way out.
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  He was already done.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.400]  He's like, all right, we got this deal with this crazy old man.
[01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:45.400]  We're leaving.
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:48.960]  And he looks out of his corner of his eye and Greedo just happens to be at a table having
[01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:49.960]  a drink.
[01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:51.600]  And he goes, Greedo!
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:56.480]  And Greedo's like, and he's like, hey, remember that time you cheated me at cards?
[01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:58.240]  And Greedo is like, oh yeah, ha ha.
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:01.560]  And then Han just shoots him dead and then walks out the door.
[01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:02.560]  Right?
[01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:06.600]  Now, you laugh, but there are scenes like in the Clint Eastwood westerns where stuff
[01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:10.760]  like that happens, where a guy just, you know, just out of the blue just shoots a guy.
[01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:14.720]  If Han had done that, I could see where Lucas would be like, I got it.
[01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:15.720]  That never sat right.
[01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:17.600]  But then Han Solo wouldn't be the Han Solo that we know.
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:20.560]  Like the reason we love him so much is because he's not that type of jerk.
[01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:21.560]  Right.
[01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:25.840]  His arc in the first movie is I start off seeming like a jerk, and then I mostly seem
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:28.120]  like I'm selfish, but in the end I'm neither one of those things.
[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:29.720]  And that's movie number one.
[01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:34.040]  I think his first thing when he shoots Greedo is like, I'm just trying to survive.
[01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:35.040]  I'm just trying to get out of here.
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:36.920]  I'm going to do this thing that I'm not happy about.
[01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:39.640]  He's a survivor for sure, you know, over my dead body.
[01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:40.640]  That's the idea.
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:41.640]  Like, it's clear he's going to be killed.
[01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:44.440]  And it's exactly until he turns around and he comes back and saves Luke, which is the
[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:45.440]  whole point.
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:48.360]  And he does, he tips the bartender extra.
[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:49.360]  Sorry for the mess.
[01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:50.360]  Sorry for the mess.
[01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:51.360]  Yeah.
[01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:57.480]  Which, I mean, the last time Jon and I killed somebody in a bar, we didn't even tip that
[01:53:57.480 --> 01:53:58.480]  well.
[01:53:58.480 --> 01:53:59.480]  Fine.
[01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:00.480]  Just bolted.
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:01.480]  Yeah.
[01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:06.360]  Jon, I'm almost surprised to hear you call the character Baby Yoda.
[01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:07.360]  He has a name.
[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:10.160]  Does he have a name?
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:16.040]  I feel like if they could have ever, I can't help but think that they regretted not giving
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:18.040]  him a name instantly.
[01:54:18.040 --> 01:54:21.920]  It's part of the mystery of season one of The Mandalorian.
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:23.960]  And it lets you defer a difficult decision until later.
[01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:24.960]  Right.
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:28.040]  And it almost- Have you guys seen the gallery for season
[01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:29.040]  two?
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:30.040]  Yeah, I did.
[01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:31.040]  Okay.
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:33.320]  It's not pertinent to this, but it will come up.
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:35.880]  And I just want to- The what for season two?
[01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:36.880]  The gallery.
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:37.880]  The Star Wars gallery.
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:38.880]  The making of.
[01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:39.880]  The making of.
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:40.880]  Oh, no, I did not see it.
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:41.880]  I did not.
[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:42.880]  But you can tell.
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:43.880]  So far, making of.
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:44.880]  Yeah.
[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:45.880]  I mean, it's not going to ruin anything.
[01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:48.520]  It's how they made it, but yeah.
[01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:51.940]  But his name is Grogu, which is a fine name.
[01:54:51.940 --> 01:54:56.660]  It's a fine Star Wars name.
[01:54:56.660 --> 01:54:58.480]  It's such a great relationship.
[01:54:58.480 --> 01:54:59.980]  I liked it immediately.
[01:54:59.980 --> 01:55:03.680]  And I know people latched on, and oh my God, he's adorable.
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:04.680]  But he is adorable.
[01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:05.680]  He is.
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:06.680]  It's that simple.
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:08.060]  There's no reason to overcomplicate it.
[01:55:08.060 --> 01:55:09.600]  It's an adorable idea.
[01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:11.840]  You get it immediately.
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:13.360]  He's one of Yoda's species.
[01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:15.400]  He's obviously special.
[01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:18.740]  He's powerful in the force.
[01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:27.160]  And it's a fantastic combination of introducing a very Star Warsian character and a MacGuffin
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:29.860]  all in one.
[01:55:29.860 --> 01:55:30.860]  It is so great.
[01:55:30.860 --> 01:55:36.820]  But then the other thing, like one of the great tricks of the original Star Wars is,
[01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:41.440]  like Spielberg has said, his favorite character is R2-D2, because he's the most purely cinematic
[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:43.820]  character in movie history, because he can't talk.
[01:55:43.820 --> 01:55:45.560]  It doesn't even make any technical sense.
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:50.280]  You have a universe where the computers can talk, obviously, because C-3PO does.
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:52.760]  And this guy just beeps, and he has an astromech.
[01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:56.180]  What does he need to talk for?
[01:55:56.180 --> 01:55:59.540]  It's just a little person at a trash can.
[01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:00.540]  You know what, though?
[01:56:00.540 --> 01:56:04.520]  When we were growing up and we could hear our hard drives whirring and be like, ooh,
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:07.760]  that's a bisector.
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:11.080]  But Chewbacca never gets a subtitle.
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:14.080]  And of course, they do the dialogue thing.
[01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:16.080]  Yeah, they do that with R2 as well.
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:18.900]  C-3PO basically translates for him by responding.
[01:56:18.900 --> 01:56:21.380]  The response includes you get to...
[01:56:21.380 --> 01:56:28.040]  But it's a great thing that only really makes sense in cinema, right?
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:35.400]  The novelizations never really capture R2-D2 or Chewbacca, or even the comic books, because
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:36.760]  it's the actual beeping.
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:39.920]  There's nothing you can do in a comic book to make the beep emote.
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:46.480]  Do you guys remember Buck Rogers, where there's a little robot who wore a medallion of another
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:48.560]  little robot that looked like a speaking spell?
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:49.560]  That was Doctor...
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:50.560]  Doctor something.
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:51.560]  Yeah.
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:54.560]  And he used to go like, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da.
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:55.560]  It was Twiggy.
[01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:56.560]  Honestly.
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:56:57.560]  Yeah.
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:56:58.560]  Yes.
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:56:59.560]  That's Planet of the Apes.
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:00.560]  That's Planet of the Apes.
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:01.560]  Yeah.
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:02.560]  I don't know.
[01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:03.560]  You go look it up.
[01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:04.560]  All I'm saying is, like, you know what?
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:05.840]  They could have done that for Star Wars.
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:06.840]  They did not.
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:09.160]  And I think it takes...
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:14.240]  One of the things that I think makes Star Wars so great is the willingness not to explain
[01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:18.440]  things to you, is to just let them sit there.
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:23.560]  And Chewbacca growls, and you're like, ugh, that didn't seem good.
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:27.480]  Or he sort of chuckles at Han, and you're like, yeah.
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:32.280]  I don't know what you're laughing about exactly, but yeah, Han's being a bit of an idiot.
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:38.400]  And you get that, and you run with it, and it lands.
[01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:41.360]  I think of anything where the prequels...
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:47.040]  Well, there's a lot of places where the prequels fell down for me, but it's over-explaining
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:48.040]  Vader.
[01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:49.040]  Oh, yeah.
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:50.040]  It's just...
[01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:51.040]  Like, just stop.
[01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:52.040]  You don't need to explain this stuff.
[01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:53.040]  Yeah.
[01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:54.040]  The magic is...
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:55.040]  Over-explaining isn't the problem.
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:56.040]  By the way, it was Dr. Theopolis.
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:57:57.040]  Thank you.
[01:57:57.040 --> 01:57:58.040]  That was it.
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:57:59.040]  That was it.
[01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:00.040]  Thank you.
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:01.440]  I was vamping to help you out.
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:02.440]  The other...
[01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:05.080]  Like, the trilogy...
[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:11.960]  The prequel thing, not to go into it too much, but getting back to The Godfather again.
[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:16.020]  The story that the prequels had to tell was, how did the good man that was your father
[01:58:16.020 --> 01:58:17.020]  become Darth Vader?
[01:58:17.020 --> 01:58:18.440]  That was the story they had to tell.
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:19.560]  We already know how it's gonna...
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:21.080]  Please tell me that story.
[01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:27.840]  And the best example in my movie canon of seeing something like that happen in a believable
[01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:32.200]  way is The Godfather Part 1 and 2, because we have someone who is essentially a good
[01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:36.480]  person at every point trying to make what he thinks is the right decision, but essentially
[01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:40.600]  ending up as a force for evil despite his best efforts, unknowingly.
[01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:42.280]  It's hard to tell that story.
[01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:43.280]  So it's not like...
[01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:45.400]  It's like, oh, please don't explain to me how Anakin turned.
[01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:46.720]  I want to know how Anakin turned.
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:47.720]  It's a great story.
[01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:51.880]  And The Godfather Part 1 and 2 tell a great story of a essentially good-hearted person,
[01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:55.160]  good-hearted smart person trying to do the right thing and ending up where he ends up
[01:58:55.160 --> 01:58:58.200]  at the end of Godfather 2, which is not a good place.
[01:58:58.200 --> 01:58:59.480]  It can be done.
[01:58:59.480 --> 01:59:00.760]  It's just pretty darn tricky.
[01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:05.400]  Well, it's actually true for both him and his father, right?
[01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:07.160]  And that's what makes The Godfather 2 so brilliant.
[01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:08.160]  Right.
[01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:09.320]  It's not what I wanted for you.
[01:59:09.320 --> 01:59:10.320]  Right.
[01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:15.840]  And also, but also a good person who is honest and does what he says he's gonna do.
[01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:20.360]  Although Marlon Brando, like the original Godfather, does end up as a comparison against
[01:59:20.360 --> 01:59:26.680]  Michael in that he gets to go out more or less never having killed his own brother.
[01:59:26.680 --> 01:59:27.680]  Right.
[01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:28.680]  You know what I mean?
[01:59:28.680 --> 01:59:29.680]  Right.
[01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:30.680]  He stuck to his code.
[01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:33.960]  He did leave his family better than he found it.
[01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:34.960]  You know what I mean?
[01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:35.960]  Right.
[01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:36.960]  Right.
[01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:39.360]  And the son didn't even live up to that, let alone be a senator.
[01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:40.360]  Right.
[01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:41.360]  Right.
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:51.640]  I'll just insert my annual holiday spectacular, perhaps surprising to many aside, that I enjoyed
[01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:57.400]  the prequel trilogy much more than just about anybody of my generation that I know and think
[01:59:57.400 --> 01:59:58.920]  that they are fine movies.
[01:59:58.920 --> 01:59:59.920]  They're not.
[01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:00.920]  Well, you watch James Bond movies.
[02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:02.760]  Are you used to some bad dialogue in John Paul?
[02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:07.320]  Well, they're not what I wanted and they're not what I would have made, but I appreciate
[02:00:07.320 --> 02:00:09.440]  them for what they are.
[02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:12.600]  The beautiful design and good music in those movies.
[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:17.720]  But I will end in the middle and I 100% agree with Syracuse that there is a beautiful design
[02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:18.720]  in there.
[02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:19.720]  Holy cow.
[02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:21.720]  Some of those shots are great.
[02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:26.040]  Phantom Menace, especially, has a lot of very vertical columns in the throne.
[02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:27.600]  There's a lot of cool stuff going on.
[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:31.280]  But Anakin Skywalker is no Michael Corleone in terms of...
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:32.280]  No.
[02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:33.640]  No, they totally blew the story.
[02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:35.000]  Like I'm saying, you can tell that story.
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.000]  They did not.
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:37.000]  Sorry.
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.640]  In any kind of believable way, they just blew it 100%.
[02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:46.160]  A much more Michael Corleone-ish, young Michael Corleone-ish, young Anakin Skywalker would
[02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:47.800]  have made for a much better trilogy.
[02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:48.800]  But anyway...
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:49.800]  Yeah, he's coming back, by the way.
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:50.800]  I don't know if you know that.
[02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:51.800]  Who is?
[02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:52.800]  Hayden Christensen.
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:53.800]  Oh, yeah, I did hear him.
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:54.800]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:00:54.800 --> 02:00:55.800]  In Kenobi.
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:00:57.800]  By the way, Kenobi's my favorite guy.
[02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:02.240]  I'm so happy that we're going to get a show about that and I'm really kind of...
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:05.240]  I've got a little bit of a trepidation about it being actually good.
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:08.200]  You know, the scripts that he can do some justice with.
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:09.200]  Yeah.
[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:10.520]  I mean, he's an amazing actor.
[02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:11.520]  Come on.
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:13.960]  Well, and there is, I guess, you know, so that's...
[02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:18.200]  Here we get to the greater expanded universe that they're popping, they're sprouting.
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:23.200]  And to me, this is what makes The Mandalorian so clearly successful is that they're using
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:26.560]  it now as the trunk to branch other things off.
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:29.280]  You've got the Boba Fett series, you've got the Ahsoka series.
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:30.280]  Right.
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:31.800]  And the Ahsoka series wasn't...
[02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:37.840]  To me, at least as somebody who doesn't follow the comic book news, comic book world news,
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:41.800]  my understanding is that the announcement that Ahsoka is going to have her own series
[02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:45.400]  came after her appearance on The Mandalorian.
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:48.440]  And during her episode, they introduced that she...
[02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:51.040]  What is she doing in the world at this time?
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:53.000]  She's hunting down Grand Admiral Thrawn.
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:56.800]  Grand Admiral Thrawn, who's a guy from the books, but also appeared in Rebels.
[02:01:56.800 --> 02:01:57.800]  Right.
[02:01:57.800 --> 02:01:59.080]  And all the quote unquote canon.
[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:00.080]  Right.
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:02.840]  And all of a sudden you're like, whoa, how is that going to fit into The Mandalorian?
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:04.800]  And it's like, this is terribly exciting.
[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:05.800]  I remember him.
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:06.800]  He's a good, bad guy.
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:10.800]  He's like, you know, whether you really, really are into him or not, you have to admit he's
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:13.320]  a pretty good, bad guy.
[02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:14.600]  And you know...
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:19.120]  He's an Erwin Rommel kind of guy, just for people who haven't...
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:22.880]  Erwin Rommel being an Aussie general.
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:23.880]  So definitely no good.
[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:27.880]  For the kids who don't know who Thrawn is, but who know who Rommel is, it's a very small
[02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:28.880]  group.
[02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:38.960]  Rommel was a Nazi general in North Africa, fought the British in the U.S. to some degree,
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:41.760]  was going to reinforce the beaches on D-Day, but ultimately turned against...
[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:46.040]  He was a Nazi general who was kind of like a Grand Admiral Thrawn, if that helps.
[02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:50.300]  But I always ultimately turned against Hitler and got shot for it.
[02:02:50.300 --> 02:02:53.900]  Not a good guy, but somebody that the British like to prop up because it made them feel
[02:02:53.900 --> 02:02:57.360]  great about fighting an honorable opponent.
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:01.240]  But Grand Admiral Thrawn is definitely like, let's take Rommel and make him blue and put
[02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:02.800]  him in space.
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:10.400]  I believe we have covered in past Holiday Spectaculars the very conspicuous plot holes
[02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:18.840]  and patchworks and gaps and things that really don't add up at all between maybe the way
[02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:24.920]  that George Lucas didn't really think things through and then tried to make them through.
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:33.360]  Like for example, why in the world did Obi-Wan and Yoda not go to kill the Emperor together?
[02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:34.940]  Why in the world would they split up?
[02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:38.720]  And then even when they failed in their own weird ways, why did they go into exile for
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:44.600]  20 years when they both clearly were very close to being able to defeat these enemies?
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:54.880]  And then just let the whole galaxy succumb to a sort of fascistic, authoritarian, evil
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:55.880]  regime?
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:57.680]  I don't know, but I think it explains what Luke did.
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:03:58.680]  He's like, I don't know.
[02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:00.160]  I don't know, Dad.
[02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:01.160]  You taught me.
[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:02.680]  I don't know why I'm smoking pot, Dad.
[02:04:02.680 --> 02:04:04.960]  You told me to run away to this island.
[02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:07.960]  The problem is that we have the prequels that tried to explain it, so that's stuck in our
[02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:08.960]  mind.
[02:04:08.960 --> 02:04:09.960]  It doesn't make sense.
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:12.800]  But without the prequels there, you can come up with reasons that make sense in terms of
[02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:19.720]  just personally being devastated by what's happened and sort of punishing yourself and
[02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:21.840]  exiling yourself and all that business.
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:22.840]  Right.
[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:29.120]  Well, even there, I think the last Jedi and Luke's position there supports that.
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:30.120]  What am I going to do?
[02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:32.200]  Walk out there with a laser sword and beat the whole Empire?
[02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:33.200]  No.
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:34.200]  I'm just a guy.
[02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:35.200]  I can't do that.
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:36.680]  I can't do it.
[02:04:36.680 --> 02:04:43.400]  And if Yoda and Obi-Wan had been like, you know what, there's two of us, there's an entire
[02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:44.720]  galaxy full of these people.
[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:46.160]  They were playing a long game.
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:49.640]  I mean, they were stupidly hiding Vader's son on his own planet, but whatever.
[02:04:49.640 --> 02:04:50.640]  Sure.
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:51.640]  They had a long game.
[02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:52.640]  The long game was Luke.
[02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:53.640]  Yeah, right.
[02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:54.640]  And Leia.
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:57.000]  But the argument about like, why didn't we just double our forces and go take out the
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:58.000]  Emperor?
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:04.400]  Well, if you ignore the prequels, that wouldn't have been an issue, right?
[02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:08.640]  Like there would have been like, well, there's about a million stormtroopers between here
[02:05:08.640 --> 02:05:09.640]  and there.
[02:05:09.640 --> 02:05:10.640]  And there's only two of us.
[02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:14.000]  And that's just not going to work no matter how much of a badass samurai you are.
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:19.800]  Well, I still think I've always thought that it was ambiguous, right from the beginning,
[02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:23.720]  just what Vader meant right in the first movie when he says, you know, when last we met,
[02:05:23.720 --> 02:05:24.720]  I was but the learner.
[02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:29.520]  I mean, you get the sense, you know, we find out later that, you know, that Obi-Wan did
[02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:31.580]  this to Vader.
[02:05:31.580 --> 02:05:37.240]  But it was always, to me, it seemed purposefully vague as to whether there was one incident
[02:05:37.240 --> 02:05:41.800]  20 years prior where that happened and they haven't seen each other since or whether they
[02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:47.200]  had seen each other in the interstitial years at some point, you know, even though it's
[02:05:47.200 --> 02:05:50.560]  clear that he hadn't seen Obi-Wan in a while.
[02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:52.660]  And yeah, they could do another thing.
[02:05:52.660 --> 02:05:57.600]  I do sort of prefer it if he just left him there.
[02:05:57.600 --> 02:06:00.920]  I don't think they're going to be seeing each other again, because it was pretty clear,
[02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:06.960]  I think, in A New Hope where it's like, they split up and they split up when last we met.
[02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:08.120]  They were student and teacher.
[02:06:08.120 --> 02:06:11.680]  We know that Obi-Wan taught him, blah, blah, blah.
[02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:15.200]  And they don't come back together again until it's on the Death Star with Luke.
[02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:19.680]  I don't think so, but I would have liked if, like, instead of chopping off and said, I
[02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:23.440]  had the high ground, which was dumb, he said, you've still got a lot to learn.
[02:06:23.440 --> 02:06:26.680]  I was going to teach you so much on the master.
[02:06:26.680 --> 02:06:27.680]  You're the learner.
[02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:28.680]  Look at you.
[02:06:28.680 --> 02:06:32.680]  Like, that would have been dickish.
[02:06:32.680 --> 02:06:37.040]  But it would have added at least a little bit to Vader's like, ah, I'm the master now.
[02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:40.400]  And speaking of things in the prequel that people don't like and everything, it's interesting
[02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:45.000]  how the Mandalorian has walked the line with the baby Yoda.
[02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:46.760]  He's got a high M count.
[02:06:46.760 --> 02:06:51.000]  We don't want to say the word, but his blood has something in it that starts with the letter
[02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:55.360]  M. Also, it's importantly, only the Imperials
[02:06:55.360 --> 02:06:56.520]  should say that.
[02:06:56.520 --> 02:06:57.520]  Right.
[02:06:57.520 --> 02:06:58.520]  And what they're doing with it, right?
[02:06:58.520 --> 02:07:02.120]  So they're either resurrecting the Emperor, they're making the Snokes or whatever the
[02:07:02.120 --> 02:07:03.120]  hell they're doing, right?
[02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:08.320]  They're tying it into the movie canon that exists in a way that's like, okay, we did
[02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:11.280]  on two seasons of this and we're still not in a big darn hurry to tell you what they're
[02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:13.240]  doing with baby Yoda's blood, right?
[02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:17.320]  But it's pretty clear they're making either Snokes or Emperors or something like that,
[02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:19.760]  or maybe a third thing that we don't know about, right?
[02:07:19.760 --> 02:07:22.720]  But we're so much all on board with that now.
[02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:27.000]  And as much as I despise the prequels and as much as I think the old talk of Maggie
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.960]  Clarence was done, I will continue to say this.
[02:07:29.960 --> 02:07:34.760]  The very first movie in the entire original trilogy, this force is strong in your family.
[02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:38.880]  It is, for better or for worse, I know people don't like it, I know they won't, you know,
[02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:41.920]  but for better or for worse, it is a hereditary thing.
[02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:46.320]  Now, interestingly for the Last Jedi people, that doesn't mean that there's literally only
[02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:49.180]  one family in the entire universe that can have the force.
[02:07:49.180 --> 02:07:53.200]  Lots of things are hereditary, like skill in sports, right?
[02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:56.960]  Can be passed on from father to son, yet there's not a single family that populates the entire
[02:07:56.960 --> 02:08:00.880]  of Major League Baseball, there are tons of family, and they can come from anywhere, so
[02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:03.080]  I just want to say that those two things can live together.
[02:08:03.080 --> 02:08:08.840]  The force, established as hereditary, also means there can be people other than the Skywalkers,
[02:08:08.840 --> 02:08:09.840]  and Palpatines have it.
[02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:13.920]  In fact, there can be millions of people who have it, and in fact, just like being good
[02:08:13.920 --> 02:08:18.120]  at baseball, just because you're good at baseball, and even if you're Andre Agassi and Steffi
[02:08:18.120 --> 02:08:20.920]  Groff, doesn't mean every single one of your kids is going to be number one in the world
[02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:22.120]  in tennis, right?
[02:08:22.120 --> 02:08:26.040]  Even though you've got, like, literally the best genes you could possibly imagine, that's
[02:08:26.040 --> 02:08:29.480]  just the way the genetic lottery works, so I'm okay with that.
[02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:33.280]  I'm okay with M-count and midichlorians if they want to say, oh, okay, well, we figured
[02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:35.360]  out how it's passed on, sort of, kind of.
[02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:38.680]  Just don't tell me too much about it, because all you have to say is, the force is strong
[02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:43.120]  in your family, I totally buy in, it makes sense, that's all that needs to be said.
[02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:55.680]  I tend to agree, I am very much into the democracy of the force that Ryan Johnson sort of introduced
[02:08:55.680 --> 02:09:01.360]  the last Jedi, but I agree that I don't think that they're opposed, you know?
[02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:05.080]  Anybody can have the force, it's just a matter of practice, and so are more and more predisposed
[02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:06.080]  than others.
[02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:08.720]  And also opportunity, which is a big part of the Ryan Johnson thing, is you don't think
[02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:11.280]  the kid who's sweeping the street has the force, but why wouldn't he?
[02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:15.480]  There's no reason the kid who's sweeping the street isn't going to be the next, you know,
[02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:17.240]  best pitcher in the major leagues, right?
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:18.240]  Exactly.
[02:09:18.240 --> 02:09:21.400]  It's all about having the opportunity to do that and not being, like, so it all, that
[02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:25.320]  all is completely harmonious to me, and I think part of the reason I haven't seen anyone
[02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:31.280]  freaking out over midichlorians and the Mandalorian is that, A, they didn't lean on it too much,
[02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:36.720]  and B, like, I think people are on board with that idea, like, I think it is actually harmonious
[02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:40.360]  and I, you know, half the reason people got bent out of shape about the last Jedi has
[02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:48.000]  nothing to do with what people say it's about, but there's no, there's no incongruity there.
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:51.920]  I feel like as they reveal more about what they were doing with baby Yoda's blood and
[02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:56.840]  whatever and they tie it into either Snoke or the Emperor or something else, that'll
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:10:00.400]  be perfectly fine because in the end, the Mandalorian thus far in two seasons has been
[02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:04.280]  a personal story about a small number of characters that we care about, and I don't see that changing.
[02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:08.880]  Yeah, I think it's a little bit like, it's like the reverse order.
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:13.760]  So with, with the midichlorians, we've got these prequels from 20 years ago that went
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:18.240]  way too much into trying to explain this, and it's like, what are you doing?
[02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:19.240]  What are you talking about?
[02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:20.320]  Where are you going?
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:21.820]  This is awful.
[02:10:21.820 --> 02:10:25.780]  And now you can just sort of touch on it and it's like, okay, we'll accept that.
[02:10:25.780 --> 02:10:29.960]  And it's like the reverse of like galactic Senate politics, right?
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:34.600]  Where in the first movie, there's some kind of talk about, wait, what are you trying to
[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:35.600]  do?
[02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:39.200]  The Senate is going to throw a fit and they're, and Tarkin is just like, ah, the Senate, the
[02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:40.200]  hell with them.
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:41.200]  And it's like, okay,
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:48.240]  It's like some low level, well, yeah, it's like a Lieutenant in the Imperial Navy being
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:52.960]  like, Hey, uh, just so you know, I'm going to have to answer a lot of calls about this.
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:53.960]  Yeah.
[02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:55.560]  And they're just like, I don't, I don't give a fuck.
[02:10:55.560 --> 02:10:56.560]  I don't care.
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:10:57.560]  I did.
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:10:58.560]  You see me strangle somebody?
[02:10:58.560 --> 02:10:59.560]  I don't care.
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:03.520]  I'm going to, I'm going to murder a diplomat, so you figure it out.
[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:07.440]  I've got questions here though, about the Grogru, the baby Yoda.
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:16.040]  So the, I, as I understand it just from watching this show, that baby Yoda is like 30 years
[02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:18.680]  old, 50 years old.
[02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:22.320]  So, and, and, and he was in the Jedi training.
[02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:26.760]  He's the same age as Anakin or the same year.
[02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:27.760]  Okay.
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:28.760]  Huh?
[02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:34.400]  And, and so that sort of explains how Yoda could be 930 years old, you know, in return
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:37.700]  to the Jedi different species age differently.
[02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:44.840]  And he's so he ages these, these, these, whatever they are age so slowly that a 50 year old
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:46.320]  still can't even talk.
[02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:48.360]  So wait, just a sec.
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:54.240]  Both of you have children and neither of you are as Zen in the force as I suspect you'd
[02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:56.480]  like to be.
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:11:58.760]  Would you put up with a toddler for 50 years?
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:02.000]  I mean, I feel like if I live for 900 years, it's all proportional, right?
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:07.360]  I wouldn't feel like I'm burning 50 years, more than half of my life changing diapers.
[02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:08.360]  Fair enough.
[02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:09.360]  Fair enough.
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:12.300]  It does seem like a lot of work, but take that trade.
[02:12:12.300 --> 02:12:15.840]  If my kids still couldn't talk at 50, but I lived 900 sign me up.
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:16.840]  All right.
[02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:19.080]  But man, what a good dad part.
[02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:25.160]  So part, part of the problem with the whole Star Wars, uh, time span, or at least the,
[02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:30.520]  the time span we're familiar with from the, you know, cause obviously you could go back
[02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:34.340]  a thousand years and I know there was the Knights of the Old Republic video game.
[02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:37.360]  That's like, they're doing a TV series for that.
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:41.240]  It's not as far back as the Knights of the Old Republic, but it's way before the New
[02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:42.240]  Hope.
[02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:43.240]  Yeah.
[02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:47.720]  If I got to pitch, I would pitch Young Yoda as a pretty good idea for a trilogy, but that's
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:48.720]  just my idea.
[02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:53.880]  I mean, the problem with Young Yoda is you are burdened with the now canon of the prequels,
[02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:54.880]  which don't...
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:13:02.440]  I am very adverse to any prequels after having watched, forget the Star Wars prequels, uh,
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:05.320]  Star Trek has had a very, very difficult time doing that.
[02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:09.800]  Both Discovery and Enterprise sort of foundered on the shores of the future.
[02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:12.760]  Yeah, let's not, come on, Discovery and Enterprise are in two different classes.
[02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:14.600]  I think Discovery is doing a pretty good job.
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:16.640]  I do, I do, but they jumped.
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:18.240]  They got out of there, right?
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:19.240]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:13:19.240 --> 02:13:26.480]  I do, I like it, but I think they, like, I'm not, I'm sincere when I say that I think they
[02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:28.640]  foundered on the shores of the future there.
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:33.520]  I think they ran up against things that they could not really rationally make sense.
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:38.240]  I don't know if they needed to, but they chose to take them seriously and they got out of
[02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:39.240]  there.
[02:13:39.240 --> 02:13:43.880]  And they've gone, not to spoil it, but they're in the far future now, and that's different.
[02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:53.160]  And it's a good show, but it doesn't, I think when you write towards an inevitable conclusion,
[02:13:53.160 --> 02:13:57.920]  you have some sort of limits on where you can go with it.
[02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:00.320]  Yeah, but you better, if you're going to do that, you better do it in the form of a trilogy
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:02.080]  where you know you're just going to have three movies or something.
[02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:03.840]  You can't do it as an ongoing TV series.
[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:04.840]  Right.
[02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:07.880]  Now, I haven't watched Better Call Saul enough to be able to call that out.
[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:11.320]  Better Call Saul is fantastic and also very different from Breaking Bad.
[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:13.680]  I think it's a great example of doing something.
[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:15.200]  Of how to do it, right?
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:16.880]  You can imagine, how can this possibly work?
[02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:20.000]  This is going to be terrible and it isn't, but it also isn't Breaking Bad.
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.060]  Yeah, I watched most of season one.
[02:14:22.060 --> 02:14:29.160]  It's on my list of like, you know what, on a rainy day when I'm sick, I'm going to binge
[02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:30.480]  it all.
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:37.080]  So here's my, here's where I'm trying to go with this, is in their timeline.
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:45.160]  There's the era when there were lots of Jedi and the whole one, two, three prequel trilogy
[02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:50.840]  is about, okay, how did they go from, there was a lot of Jedi in a Jedi order to the Jedi
[02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:59.040]  are almost extinct when Obi Wan's old and young, Luke is 20, 20 years old and gets trained.
[02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:04.160]  And there's a time when we're down to literally the last Jedi, right?
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:12.680]  That's the name of a movie, yet you can't make Star Wars movies without Jedi, right?
[02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:16.280]  That's the thing, that's the difference between Star Wars and Buck Rogers.
[02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:18.360]  You could, but you want to, right?
[02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:19.360]  And that's-
[02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:25.400]  I mean, The Mandalorian did for most of season one, Solo had a Jedi in it.
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:33.840]  But it's hard and it's like you end up with the, I was not a fan of the Rebels show, but
[02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:36.440]  you got that kid, what was his name?
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:37.440]  Ezra.
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:38.440]  Whatever happened to him?
[02:15:38.440 --> 02:15:39.440]  Is he dead?
[02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:40.440]  No.
[02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:44.880]  He went after his Thrawn, which is where we're getting back to the Thrawn thing.
[02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:47.600]  The characters may be less annoying as adults.
[02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:51.100]  But you end up with this thing where it's like, you kind of, as a creator, you need
[02:15:51.100 --> 02:15:55.920]  to start, you need to invent some Jedi because otherwise this isn't Star Wars.
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:59.480]  But that's the beauty of the Jedi though, is because it's genetic and because it can
[02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:01.680]  pop up anywhere, right?
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:04.520]  That anybody can be strong with the Force and all you really need at that point is a
[02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:08.240]  lightsaber and those don't seem to be too hard to come by and all the religious aspects
[02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:13.080]  around it of the Jedi Order and the kyber crystals and all these ceremonies, that can
[02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:14.080]  grow and change.
[02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:17.240]  And the Old Republic Jedi are nothing like the Jedi in the prequels and can be nothing
[02:16:17.240 --> 02:16:18.640]  like the Jedi in the future.
[02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:22.380]  If you have a universe where the Force exists and people have laser swords, there will always
[02:16:22.380 --> 02:16:23.380]  be Jedi.
[02:16:23.380 --> 02:16:24.440]  So I don't worry about that.
[02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:25.440]  Well, what?
[02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:28.080]  And in fact, Ahsoka is nothing like the Jedi we've seen, right?
[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:30.200]  Yeah, she's got big problems with the Jedi Order.
[02:16:30.200 --> 02:16:37.720]  Yeah, she's like, honestly, she did the Mario thing, it's like your princess is in another
[02:16:37.720 --> 02:16:38.720]  castle.
[02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:39.720]  Right.
[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:44.320]  She's like a ronin, right?
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:46.040]  She's the Jedi equivalent of a ronin.
[02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:47.040]  100%.
[02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:50.640]  And who knows how many other ones like that are out there who are just strong in the Force?
[02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:52.360]  I mean, what is Grogu?
[02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:53.360]  He's not being...
[02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:54.840]  Well, I guess Luke's adopted now, we'll see how that...
[02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:55.840]  But we know how that goes.
[02:16:55.840 --> 02:16:59.560]  Luke ends up not doing too well as running a Jedi Academy.
[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:02.560]  Oh, and here's where I'm going.
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:04.040]  What was Yoda thinking?
[02:17:04.040 --> 02:17:09.600]  Yoda obviously knew about Grogu and so did Obi-Wan because he was born 50 years before.
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:10.600]  And so that whole time...
[02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:11.920]  He kind of thought he was dead, though.
[02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:17.120]  So we know that in Revenge of the Sith, most of the Jedi are killed and the Jedi Temple
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:20.460]  is burned down or whatever, and Yoda could think all the younglings, they're all gone
[02:17:20.460 --> 02:17:21.460]  now.
[02:17:21.460 --> 02:17:25.080]  Turns out, maybe Yoda was out eating eggs and he didn't get burned down.
[02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:31.640]  Let's not say that Yoda is racist, but that he just...
[02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:38.600]  Well, remember Yoda and the stupid prequels, just flying around on troop carriers and commanding
[02:17:38.600 --> 02:17:42.360]  troops in the field and doing all sorts of BS or whatever, but when everything went down
[02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:47.840]  with the Jedi Temple and everyone getting killed and Anakin killing the younglings and
[02:17:47.840 --> 02:17:52.680]  everything, Grogu, like I said, he was out stealing eggs somewhere and he managed to
[02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:54.480]  dodge that whole thing and he's so small.
[02:17:54.480 --> 02:17:56.440]  Nobody noticed and maybe someone smuggled him away.
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:18:01.120]  It's really easy to get Grogu out of that situation without anybody knowing.
[02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:03.800]  And especially since he doesn't know what he's doing, he's little, he doesn't know how
[02:18:03.800 --> 02:18:07.040]  to reach out through the forest, they had to put him on the rock for that.
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:12.240]  Real easy for there to be Jedi all over the place that Obi-Wan and Yoda do not know about.
[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:16.560]  And Jedi sympathizes, too.
[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:22.000]  Like oh my god, Anakin is out here murdering everybody.
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:23.920]  I'm just going to grab this kid and run.
[02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:26.160]  That seems reasonable.
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:32.520]  Like the guy that's cleaning the floors in the Jedi Temple maybe puts down the cyberspace
[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:35.040]  mop and just grabs the kid and runs.
[02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:37.400]  Grogu's tall, he's easy to hide.
[02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:38.400]  Yeah.
[02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:40.520]  Well, here's where I'm going with it, though.
[02:18:40.520 --> 02:18:47.160]  Now we reached the end of season two and I thought it was a pretty good plot point.
[02:18:47.160 --> 02:18:51.880]  I don't love the way it was directed where we watched it on security cameras.
[02:18:51.880 --> 02:18:55.000]  Yeah, well, you know, you do have an effects budget to stay within.
[02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:58.760]  You can keep the hood on and keep it in grainy video, it saves a lot of money.
[02:18:58.760 --> 02:18:59.760]  I liked it.
[02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:02.640]  I thought it built up a lot.
[02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:04.240]  I liked it.
[02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:05.240]  Everybody knows who it is.
[02:19:05.240 --> 02:19:07.440]  You can tell from the markings on the X-wing for crying out.
[02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:08.440]  Yeah, but they weren't read.
[02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:10.240]  I loved it somehow.
[02:19:10.240 --> 02:19:19.120]  And god knows when future slash past slash incredible technology, they still don't have
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:24.200]  like LCD screens.
[02:19:24.200 --> 02:19:27.080]  It's like, yeah, it's black and white and it skips a few frames.
[02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:28.720]  Who knows if those are red markings?
[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:30.040]  It's the lived in future.
[02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:31.040]  Right.
[02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:33.640]  But we've reached the end of season two.
[02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:38.440]  Luke Skywalker swoops in is the Luke we've always wanted.
[02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:39.440]  He doesn't swoop, man.
[02:19:39.440 --> 02:19:40.440]  He saunters in.
[02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:41.440]  Yeah.
[02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:42.440]  He swooped in with the X-wing.
[02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:43.440]  I mean, that was a swoop.
[02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:51.000]  I mean, there's a very cool line, very cool line where Cara, I forget her last name, Cara
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:52.000]  something whatever.
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:53.000]  Dune?
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:54.000]  Duff?
[02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:55.000]  Something like that.
[02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:56.000]  Cara Trace.
[02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:57.000]  No, sorry.
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:58.000]  Wrong one.
[02:19:58.000 --> 02:19:59.000]  But she says, what good is one X-wing?
[02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:00.000]  Right.
[02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:01.000]  And it's Cara Dune.
[02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:02.000]  Cara Dune.
[02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:03.000]  It's Gina Carano.
[02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:04.000]  Right.
[02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:07.740]  And what a great line because it's like, oh, you know, it's like, whoa, like, we're all
[02:20:07.740 --> 02:20:11.060]  vaguely aware of the timeline.
[02:20:11.060 --> 02:20:13.140]  And it's like, oh my god, no.
[02:20:13.140 --> 02:20:18.480]  And I have to say, I didn't watch it like on day one, but I've gotten so good at staying
[02:20:18.480 --> 02:20:19.480]  spoiler free.
[02:20:19.480 --> 02:20:20.480]  Yeah.
[02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:21.480]  I had no idea.
[02:20:21.480 --> 02:20:22.480]  I didn't even.
[02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:23.480]  I had no idea as well.
[02:20:23.480 --> 02:20:24.480]  I had no idea.
[02:20:24.480 --> 02:20:30.460]  And I'm watching with my son and he said it, he was like, it's Luke and I was like, I think
[02:20:30.460 --> 02:20:31.460]  you're right.
[02:20:31.460 --> 02:20:33.160]  And it's like, oh, it was so awesome.
[02:20:33.160 --> 02:20:34.220]  So satisfying.
[02:20:34.220 --> 02:20:38.420]  I don't, I didn't love watching the whole thing on the security footage, but it's fine
[02:20:38.420 --> 02:20:41.700]  because it was cool and he was Luke and he was as awesome as you could think.
[02:20:41.700 --> 02:20:43.540]  But wait, it wasn't the whole thing.
[02:20:43.540 --> 02:20:44.540]  And it...
[02:20:44.540 --> 02:20:45.540]  Right.
[02:20:45.540 --> 02:20:46.540]  Well, and then...
[02:20:46.540 --> 02:20:48.940]  Honestly, I think it would have been good.
[02:20:48.940 --> 02:20:50.940]  Well, the fight was...
[02:20:50.940 --> 02:20:57.900]  It would have maybe fed our childish wishes to see him just murder a bunch of toys.
[02:20:57.900 --> 02:21:01.460]  What some people wanted was the equivalent of the Rogue One Vader hallway scene.
[02:21:01.460 --> 02:21:02.460]  Right, right.
[02:21:02.460 --> 02:21:03.460]  But they got it.
[02:21:03.460 --> 02:21:04.460]  Right.
[02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:05.460]  They literally did.
[02:21:05.460 --> 02:21:06.460]  It wasn't as artfully done.
[02:21:06.460 --> 02:21:09.060]  The Vader hallway scene was beautifully shot and complicated.
[02:21:09.060 --> 02:21:10.060]  Yes.
[02:21:10.060 --> 02:21:12.780]  Because you can put any guy in that suit and you don't have to see the face and everything
[02:21:12.780 --> 02:21:13.780]  like that.
[02:21:13.780 --> 02:21:16.060]  This one, they felt like they had, you know, it was less dynamic.
[02:21:16.060 --> 02:21:17.780]  The dark troopers are just kind of lined up.
[02:21:17.780 --> 02:21:18.780]  Like it's a TV show.
[02:21:18.780 --> 02:21:19.780]  Ultimately, it's a show.
[02:21:19.780 --> 02:21:20.780]  Exactly.
[02:21:20.780 --> 02:21:21.780]  Right.
[02:21:21.780 --> 02:21:22.780]  It's a TV show.
[02:21:22.780 --> 02:21:23.780]  But I...
[02:21:23.780 --> 02:21:24.780]  It works for me.
[02:21:24.780 --> 02:21:32.500]  I think it gave us the Luke that we wanted to see back in, let's say, when was, Jedi
[02:21:32.500 --> 02:21:33.500]  83?
[02:21:33.500 --> 02:21:34.500]  Well...
[02:21:34.500 --> 02:21:37.900]  85 when we were like, how powerful is Luke Skywalker?
[02:21:37.900 --> 02:21:38.900]  Yeah.
[02:21:38.900 --> 02:21:40.900]  Not that powerful.
[02:21:40.900 --> 02:21:44.180]  You assume he continues to grow after the movie because he barely gets out of the Death
[02:21:44.180 --> 02:21:46.060]  Star 2 by the skin of his teeth, right?
[02:21:46.060 --> 02:21:47.060]  Right.
[02:21:47.060 --> 02:21:48.060]  Yeah.
[02:21:48.060 --> 02:21:49.060]  Yeah.
[02:21:49.060 --> 02:21:50.820]  Which is why I liked him in The Last Jedi when he was like, yeah, I'm done with this.
[02:21:50.820 --> 02:21:51.820]  This sucks.
[02:21:51.820 --> 02:21:54.780]  But we can, yeah, different discussion.
[02:21:54.780 --> 02:22:00.620]  Well, but I also enjoy though that they spent more time and him beating the dark troopers
[02:22:00.620 --> 02:22:07.320]  was sort of handled quickly and then they let it be more of a moment of, whoa, whoa,
[02:22:07.320 --> 02:22:08.320]  but wait a second.
[02:22:08.320 --> 02:22:09.320]  And now what?
[02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:13.260]  He's just going away with Grogu and that's it?
[02:22:13.260 --> 02:22:14.260]  Grogu's gone?
[02:22:14.260 --> 02:22:19.540]  Because you know Luke is not going to be in the show every week, right?
[02:22:19.540 --> 02:22:23.300]  It's like baby Grogu is gone and we love baby Yoda.
[02:22:23.300 --> 02:22:24.780]  The whole world loves baby Yoda.
[02:22:24.780 --> 02:22:25.780]  Yeah.
[02:22:25.780 --> 02:22:26.780]  Well, that's part of it.
[02:22:26.780 --> 02:22:28.980]  I feel like with season three of The Mandalorian, which is actually going to be a little bit
[02:22:28.980 --> 02:22:32.180]  of a gap, the whole show doesn't have to be a baby Yoda.
[02:22:32.180 --> 02:22:36.740]  I feel like that situation has been resolved up until the point where the Jedi temple burns
[02:22:36.740 --> 02:22:38.900]  down and Luke totally blows it and training everybody.
[02:22:38.900 --> 02:22:39.900]  But that's a different trilogy.
[02:22:39.900 --> 02:22:42.400]  If it's like 10 years out, that's like a long way out.
[02:22:42.400 --> 02:22:45.740]  But anyway, Grogu, it's not like he's going to be flying back to visit Grogu every time.
[02:22:45.740 --> 02:22:46.860]  He doesn't need to.
[02:22:46.860 --> 02:22:47.860]  Right.
[02:22:47.860 --> 02:22:48.980]  But it feels sad.
[02:22:48.980 --> 02:22:50.740]  I was sad watching it.
[02:22:50.740 --> 02:22:54.020]  I believe that The Mandalorian is sad to say goodbye.
[02:22:54.020 --> 02:22:57.940]  I believe Grogu was sad.
[02:22:57.940 --> 02:23:05.580]  And it all felt true and earned and it is like this is a total Star Wars success.
[02:23:05.580 --> 02:23:11.100]  And I always come back to the word camaraderie as what I loved about the original trilogy.
[02:23:11.100 --> 02:23:16.140]  What I love most about Empire Strikes Back is that it really established the sort of
[02:23:16.140 --> 02:23:19.980]  camaraderie between our heroes.
[02:23:19.980 --> 02:23:24.780]  And you know, there's a legitimate camaraderie between The Mandalorian and Grogu and which
[02:23:24.780 --> 02:23:32.180]  is amazing because The Mandalorian is a guy in a helmet who barely talks and Grogu doesn't
[02:23:32.180 --> 02:23:35.700]  talk and is a puppet.
[02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:36.700]  Right.
[02:23:36.700 --> 02:23:37.700]  Right?
[02:23:37.700 --> 02:23:43.660]  Empire Strikes Back, Han Solo rides out into the cold to his death to save Luke Skywalker
[02:23:43.660 --> 02:23:49.060]  who I don't remember the last thing he said to him, but it was it was like, basically,
[02:23:49.060 --> 02:23:50.580]  I'm out of here, kid.
[02:23:50.580 --> 02:23:53.620]  Like, I'm going to take my money and I'm leaving.
[02:23:53.620 --> 02:23:55.620]  That's the last thing we saw him say.
[02:23:55.620 --> 02:24:01.860]  Yeah, one of the smart things Empire did was have a bunch of stuff happening off camera,
[02:24:01.860 --> 02:24:05.660]  which they reference to say, look, we've become a tight knit unit.
[02:24:05.660 --> 02:24:08.580]  The Bounty Hunter, Orton Mandel, like all of that.
[02:24:08.580 --> 02:24:11.600]  At the end of A New Hope, we were friends, we all hugged in the hangar, we all got medals
[02:24:11.600 --> 02:24:13.100]  except for Chewie.
[02:24:13.100 --> 02:24:15.400]  But then even since then, we've been on adventures together.
[02:24:15.400 --> 02:24:16.560]  So we are now tight.
[02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:20.900]  So it doesn't, you know, like the, what do you call it, the bounty hunter we met on Orton
[02:24:20.900 --> 02:24:21.900]  Mandel or whatever.
[02:24:21.900 --> 02:24:25.980]  Like, there are adventures that happen between A New Hope and Empire, which lets you start
[02:24:25.980 --> 02:24:29.380]  Empire with, I'm going out there in the cold to save my friend.
[02:24:29.380 --> 02:24:30.380]  Right.
[02:24:30.380 --> 02:24:31.380]  Exactly.
[02:24:31.380 --> 02:24:34.780]  And I'm not quite sure this show has done that yet.
[02:24:34.780 --> 02:24:37.020]  But it's, but it's harder with Grogu.
[02:24:37.020 --> 02:24:38.020]  He's a little kid.
[02:24:38.020 --> 02:24:39.020]  He's a baby.
[02:24:39.020 --> 02:24:40.020]  He's a baby Yoda.
[02:24:40.020 --> 02:24:41.020]  He's cute and everything.
[02:24:41.020 --> 02:24:44.300]  And the Mandalorian felt for him because he himself was a foundling, you know, it's all
[02:24:44.300 --> 02:24:46.460]  little connects together with the whole thing.
[02:24:46.460 --> 02:24:50.380]  But he also recognizes I don't, you know, this whole force, he doesn't even know what
[02:24:50.380 --> 02:24:51.720]  the heck the force is.
[02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:53.860]  He's just trying to do right by this kid.
[02:24:53.860 --> 02:24:58.340]  He realizes that me raising this kid is probably not the best, especially since he's got this
[02:24:58.340 --> 02:25:00.900]  gift, which I can't help him develop in any way whatsoever.
[02:25:00.900 --> 02:25:04.900]  So he calls the Jedi, and Luke shows up, which seems like a best case scenario, but obviously
[02:25:04.900 --> 02:25:06.900]  he hasn't seen Seven, Eight, and Nine.
[02:25:06.900 --> 02:25:07.900]  Right.
[02:25:07.900 --> 02:25:09.380]  That's where I'm going.
[02:25:09.380 --> 02:25:12.140]  Baby Yoda does not seem to have a bright future.
[02:25:12.140 --> 02:25:13.140]  Right?
[02:25:13.140 --> 02:25:17.540]  I mean, maybe he dies in the Jedi Temple, or maybe, like his species, he's pretty wily
[02:25:17.540 --> 02:25:20.940]  and he gets the hell out of there and he's just hanging out on a small planet somewhere.
[02:25:20.940 --> 02:25:30.820]  I suspect that we discover that Luke finds him untrainable because he's too attached
[02:25:30.820 --> 02:25:31.820]  to...
[02:25:31.820 --> 02:25:33.540]  Oh, the attachment thing.
[02:25:33.540 --> 02:25:34.940]  Don't get me started on that.
[02:25:34.940 --> 02:25:35.940]  Yeah, I know.
[02:25:35.940 --> 02:25:36.940]  I know.
[02:25:36.940 --> 02:25:39.460]  Here's the problem with Grogu.
[02:25:39.460 --> 02:25:45.760]  I don't think there's ever going to be the budget available to do a Yoda TV series, because
[02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:49.900]  you can't make a character like Yoda emote and be amazing like they did in Empire, but
[02:25:49.900 --> 02:25:52.860]  to do it on a TV budget, I don't think you can do that.
[02:25:52.860 --> 02:25:53.860]  So I think Grogu...
[02:25:53.860 --> 02:25:56.100]  I also don't think a character like that can hold a show.
[02:25:56.100 --> 02:25:57.100]  I don't.
[02:25:57.100 --> 02:25:58.100]  Even Baby Yoda.
[02:25:58.100 --> 02:26:01.820]  They can, depending on how you do it.
[02:26:01.820 --> 02:26:07.700]  I think they're the accents on a story that our main protagonist is going through.
[02:26:07.700 --> 02:26:10.220]  I think that that's the way those characters are going through.
[02:26:10.220 --> 02:26:13.820]  I mean, you think about something like the Dark Crystal, or even like the Hobbit movies,
[02:26:13.820 --> 02:26:21.480]  you can have a diminutive, somewhat alien-looking character carry a franchise, but Baby Yoda
[02:26:21.480 --> 02:26:22.480]  probably...
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:24.100]  You really did win with the Dark Crystal.
[02:26:24.100 --> 02:26:27.060]  But I mean, even then, like, did you watch the Netflix show?
[02:26:27.060 --> 02:26:28.060]  Did you watch the Netflix show?
[02:26:28.060 --> 02:26:29.060]  Because it...
[02:26:29.060 --> 02:26:30.060]  Yeah.
[02:26:30.060 --> 02:26:31.060]  They didn't...
[02:26:31.060 --> 02:26:32.060]  All right.
[02:26:32.060 --> 02:26:33.060]  It didn't land as well.
[02:26:33.060 --> 02:26:34.060]  We got to wrap it up.
[02:26:34.060 --> 02:26:35.060]  I have two more questions.
[02:26:35.060 --> 02:26:38.660]  Number one, specific to the special effects, what do we think about the special effects
[02:26:38.660 --> 02:26:40.260]  to make young Luke?
[02:26:40.260 --> 02:26:41.860]  I thought it was great.
[02:26:41.860 --> 02:26:44.420]  I was like, this is really pretty good.
[02:26:44.420 --> 02:26:47.460]  And you're renowned for your keen vision, so...
[02:26:47.460 --> 02:26:53.820]  I'm back to 2020 in one eye, so...
[02:26:53.820 --> 02:26:54.820]  You're right.
[02:26:54.820 --> 02:26:57.500]  You probably actually have better vision than I do with my stupid glasses.
[02:26:57.500 --> 02:26:58.500]  You'd be surprised.
[02:26:58.500 --> 02:27:04.820]  But I really, you know, it was a perfect no, but it was good, and it was clearly of the
[02:27:04.820 --> 02:27:10.060]  same technique that they used to make young Leia in Rogue One, which I actually was...
[02:27:10.060 --> 02:27:11.380]  I was okay with.
[02:27:11.380 --> 02:27:13.380]  I thought that was fine.
[02:27:13.380 --> 02:27:16.620]  I mean, like, I think I said when we were discussing this in one of the slacks that
[02:27:16.620 --> 02:27:19.140]  we're in, like, the way they would do this when we were kids is they would get a young
[02:27:19.140 --> 02:27:20.900]  actor that looked sort of like Luke.
[02:27:20.900 --> 02:27:21.900]  Right.
[02:27:21.900 --> 02:27:26.260]  And we would know it's not Luke, and we would be like, yeah, that's what you do on TV, right?
[02:27:26.260 --> 02:27:29.100]  These days, the thing that you do is what they did, which was computers.
[02:27:29.100 --> 02:27:31.220]  And then you look at it, and does it look convincing?
[02:27:31.220 --> 02:27:33.140]  No, but it's like, it's fine.
[02:27:33.140 --> 02:27:35.620]  Like, look, you're just trying to tell a story.
[02:27:35.620 --> 02:27:39.420]  It's like, the way I put it for a lot of this stuff is like when you watch, like, a play
[02:27:39.420 --> 02:27:43.340]  at a kid's school and someone comes up with a big cardboard boat or something, it doesn't
[02:27:43.340 --> 02:27:44.760]  look like a real boat.
[02:27:44.760 --> 02:27:47.340]  But for the purposes of the story, you're like, I'm not going to spend the whole time
[02:27:47.340 --> 02:27:49.740]  hanging up in, like, that cardboard boat doesn't look real.
[02:27:49.740 --> 02:27:51.340]  Like, just enjoy the performance, right?
[02:27:51.340 --> 02:27:56.620]  So all they need to do is say, this is Luke, and amazingly, with technology, we can make
[02:27:56.620 --> 02:27:59.860]  them look actually pretty close to the real Luke and do this amazingly with the voice,
[02:27:59.860 --> 02:28:03.500]  which I still don't know how they do, and just accept it as part of the story.
[02:28:03.500 --> 02:28:04.500]  And I did.
[02:28:04.500 --> 02:28:05.500]  And it was fine.
[02:28:05.500 --> 02:28:06.740]  Now, again, can you build a series?
[02:28:06.740 --> 02:28:09.020]  Can you build a young Luke franchise for that CGI Luke?
[02:28:09.020 --> 02:28:11.900]  No, you absolutely cannot, because the tech is not ready, and it's super expensive and
[02:28:11.900 --> 02:28:13.020]  hard to do.
[02:28:13.020 --> 02:28:16.500]  But for the purposes of storytelling, I'm fine with it.
[02:28:16.500 --> 02:28:18.220]  Just the same thing I was with The Rogue One and everything.
[02:28:18.220 --> 02:28:19.260]  It's just, they're just not there.
[02:28:19.260 --> 02:28:22.620]  The thing is, you're never going to get there if you don't keep trying to do it.
[02:28:22.620 --> 02:28:24.700]  So I always applaud the effort.
[02:28:24.700 --> 02:28:31.860]  The voice was so good that it was, like, completely, completely, for me, 100% believable.
[02:28:31.860 --> 02:28:35.580]  But then you immediately go to, this is terrifying, because 10 years from now, they're going to
[02:28:35.580 --> 02:28:38.140]  be able to make anybody sound like anybody.
[02:28:38.140 --> 02:28:39.220]  I mean, you could already do that.
[02:28:39.220 --> 02:28:41.420]  You ever use Descripts to do that with your own voice?
[02:28:41.420 --> 02:28:44.540]  Yeah, Descripts is an awesome app, by the way.
[02:28:44.540 --> 02:28:46.300]  That's like the janky version of it.
[02:28:46.300 --> 02:28:48.420]  Honestly, I don't know how they did it.
[02:28:48.420 --> 02:28:51.220]  I was hoping the gallery thing would tell me, because that's all I wanted to know.
[02:28:51.220 --> 02:28:54.900]  I know how they did the CGI face, because we all know how they did it in, you know,
[02:28:54.900 --> 02:28:56.380]  in Rogue One and everything.
[02:28:56.380 --> 02:28:57.380]  But how do you do the voice?
[02:28:57.380 --> 02:28:58.380]  Because you have choices.
[02:28:58.380 --> 02:29:02.900]  You can have Mimic do the voice, you can have Mark Hamill do the voice and then modify it,
[02:29:02.900 --> 02:29:07.980]  or you can manufacture the voice out of sound samples, which is what Descript does, only,
[02:29:07.980 --> 02:29:09.340]  you know, in a jankier way.
[02:29:09.340 --> 02:29:11.260]  But I don't know which one of those three things they did.
[02:29:11.260 --> 02:29:17.660]  Well, just from comments that Hamill has made on Twitter, I believe he was involved in the
[02:29:17.660 --> 02:29:18.660]  production.
[02:29:18.660 --> 02:29:23.860]  Somehow, I'm going to have to guess it was voice and maybe mocap.
[02:29:23.860 --> 02:29:24.860]  I don't know.
[02:29:24.860 --> 02:29:27.500]  They're going to mocap that old guy for the young Luke thing.
[02:29:27.500 --> 02:29:28.500]  Who knows?
[02:29:28.500 --> 02:29:29.500]  Well, no, no.
[02:29:29.500 --> 02:29:34.540]  Not for the fighting stuff, but for like the I'm hanging out with R2 and like the speech,
[02:29:34.540 --> 02:29:35.540]  the monologue.
[02:29:35.540 --> 02:29:40.060]  Even the voice wasn't 100% convincing, because when I listen to it, I'm like, that's super
[02:29:40.060 --> 02:29:43.180]  close, but not quite.
[02:29:43.180 --> 02:29:44.180]  I don't know.
[02:29:44.180 --> 02:29:45.180]  I loved it.
[02:29:45.180 --> 02:29:46.180]  I thought it was a great twist.
[02:29:46.180 --> 02:29:48.140]  It deserved well-earned.
[02:29:48.140 --> 02:29:49.140]  I did.
[02:29:49.140 --> 02:29:50.780]  My last topic is
[02:29:50.780 --> 02:29:51.780]  Wait, wait.
[02:29:51.780 --> 02:29:52.780]  Just one second.
[02:29:52.780 --> 02:29:58.420]  I agree 100% with Syracuse that, yes, we should keep doing this.
[02:29:58.420 --> 02:30:04.900]  I think that in the future, we're going to see, like in comic books and everything else,
[02:30:04.900 --> 02:30:08.220]  representations are going to change over time.
[02:30:08.220 --> 02:30:11.340]  And yet the characters are going to remain the same.
[02:30:11.340 --> 02:30:15.580]  We have the technology, more or less, to do that now, and I think we're going to see it
[02:30:15.580 --> 02:30:16.580]  more often.
[02:30:16.580 --> 02:30:21.700]  And I think subsequent generations are just going to come to see like, well, that Superman
[02:30:21.700 --> 02:30:28.900]  looked like he should have had a mustache or just looked a little bit off, or Leia looked
[02:30:28.900 --> 02:30:29.900]  a little
[02:30:29.900 --> 02:30:35.060]  And in the case of Leia and Vogue 1, I know there were some last minute changes to that
[02:30:35.060 --> 02:30:39.020]  or I've been told there were some last minute changes to that scene that changed the lighting
[02:30:39.020 --> 02:30:41.540]  on it that made it stand out a little bit more.
[02:30:41.540 --> 02:30:47.740]  There are difficulties doing this, but if you've seen Ant-Man, it works pretty great.
[02:30:47.740 --> 02:30:54.460]  Like there's a bunch of stuff that has done this technology, or Captain Marvel, they de-aged
[02:30:54.460 --> 02:30:57.860]  Sam Jackson.
[02:30:57.860 --> 02:31:00.780]  Using this technology is just going to make it more and more effective.
[02:31:00.780 --> 02:31:08.940]  And I think it's a viable and interesting way forward in terms of keeping these essentially
[02:31:08.940 --> 02:31:15.260]  mythological characters alive and in representation of the people that first embodied them.
[02:31:15.260 --> 02:31:18.380]  Do I think that's necessarily healthy as a culture?
[02:31:18.380 --> 02:31:19.380]  No.
[02:31:19.380 --> 02:31:24.700]  Especially since we are accustomed to and totally accept the other thing, which we saw
[02:31:24.700 --> 02:31:26.220]  our whole life and even did it in solo.
[02:31:26.220 --> 02:31:28.220]  You just get a different actor.
[02:31:28.220 --> 02:31:29.220]  We accept it.
[02:31:29.220 --> 02:31:30.220]  Like, we're not freaking out.
[02:31:30.220 --> 02:31:31.420]  Like, that's not young Harrison Ford.
[02:31:31.420 --> 02:31:32.420]  We're fine.
[02:31:32.420 --> 02:31:33.420]  People can handle it.
[02:31:33.420 --> 02:31:34.420]  It happens all the time.
[02:31:34.420 --> 02:31:36.980]  It does not detract from the storytelling in any way.
[02:31:36.980 --> 02:31:38.580]  And it is way cheaper.
[02:31:38.580 --> 02:31:40.220]  I agree.
[02:31:40.220 --> 02:31:44.100]  And yet I admire the reach of trying to do it.
[02:31:44.100 --> 02:31:45.460]  Because I'm still waiting.
[02:31:45.460 --> 02:31:47.980]  I paid to see Final Fantasy Spirits within.
[02:31:47.980 --> 02:31:52.660]  I am all in on full CG photo-real people.
[02:31:52.660 --> 02:31:53.660]  Absolutely.
[02:31:53.660 --> 02:31:54.660]  100%.
[02:31:54.660 --> 02:31:55.660]  Do it.
[02:31:55.660 --> 02:31:56.660]  Let's get there.
[02:31:56.660 --> 02:31:57.660]  Did you enjoy that movie?
[02:31:57.660 --> 02:31:58.660]  Because I did not.
[02:31:58.660 --> 02:31:59.660]  No, I did not.
[02:31:59.660 --> 02:32:00.660]  It's not going to go.
[02:32:00.660 --> 02:32:01.660]  But I'm happy I paid to see it.
[02:32:01.660 --> 02:32:06.940]  But I wanted to give them my money and say, yes, keep trying to do that because I think
[02:32:06.940 --> 02:32:11.220]  that's a super cool thing that you can do.
[02:32:11.220 --> 02:32:16.180]  What did you guys think of The Irishman and the aging effects in The Irishman?
[02:32:16.180 --> 02:32:19.020]  I mean, that's no.
[02:32:19.020 --> 02:32:23.180]  I like, again, I think it's a good thing to be able to do well.
[02:32:23.180 --> 02:32:28.780]  Because for certain stories, it's super important to be able to do it well, because if that's
[02:32:28.780 --> 02:32:29.780]  the thing you want to do.
[02:32:29.780 --> 02:32:32.700]  But for The Irishman, it just felt like getting the band back together.
[02:32:32.700 --> 02:32:35.940]  But the band is all 70 and you wish they weren't.
[02:32:35.940 --> 02:32:38.100]  Yeah, I feel the same way.
[02:32:38.100 --> 02:32:44.500]  I think any trick done as a trick is worth pulling off.
[02:32:44.500 --> 02:32:51.120]  I think Jimi Hendrix lighting his guitar on fire with lighter fluid and then playing with
[02:32:51.120 --> 02:32:52.120]  his teeth.
[02:32:52.120 --> 02:32:53.120]  That's cool.
[02:32:53.120 --> 02:32:59.220]  Maybe don't do a whole concert like that is kind of my feeling on that.
[02:32:59.220 --> 02:33:03.660]  Do it where it's appropriate and where it's going to get a wow and a bang factor.
[02:33:03.660 --> 02:33:07.460]  I think Rogue One tried to do that well, and I think certainly the Mandalorian season two
[02:33:07.460 --> 02:33:11.660]  at the finale tried to do that well.
[02:33:11.660 --> 02:33:13.760]  Don't hang your hat on that.
[02:33:13.760 --> 02:33:19.040]  It's a trick, appreciate it like a trick, and deploy it accordingly.
[02:33:19.040 --> 02:33:22.060]  It wasn't good enough to be a full-length movie.
[02:33:22.060 --> 02:33:24.620]  The effect wasn't good enough to build a whole movie on.
[02:33:24.620 --> 02:33:26.980]  Again, you're not going to do it unless you keep trying.
[02:33:26.980 --> 02:33:30.260]  And I think the story of The Irishman was good, and certainly the talents involved were
[02:33:30.260 --> 02:33:31.260]  good.
[02:33:31.260 --> 02:33:36.340]  But you really need a young man's energy to play a young man, and you can de-age De Niro
[02:33:36.340 --> 02:33:39.420]  all you want, but he's not that young man anymore.
[02:33:39.420 --> 02:33:44.540]  And the particular scene where it stood out, everybody's talked about it, is the curb stomping
[02:33:44.540 --> 02:33:45.540]  scene.
[02:33:45.540 --> 02:33:48.740]  It's a seven-year-old body, right?
[02:33:48.740 --> 02:33:49.740]  Right.
[02:33:49.740 --> 02:33:50.740]  And it's like that's...
[02:33:50.740 --> 02:33:51.740]  That's budget.
[02:33:51.740 --> 02:33:55.500]  You can de-age the body too, but now it gets even more expensive and troublesome.
[02:33:55.500 --> 02:33:58.260]  And it's like, well, then why do we even have the real actor in there at that point?
[02:33:58.260 --> 02:33:59.420]  It's like, yes, exactly.
[02:33:59.420 --> 02:34:00.420]  Just get someone.
[02:34:00.420 --> 02:34:03.540]  De Niro played a young Marlon Brando, and it was fine.
[02:34:03.540 --> 02:34:04.540]  Like it worked great.
[02:34:04.540 --> 02:34:06.060]  We're okay with it.
[02:34:06.060 --> 02:34:07.060]  Yeah, especially...
[02:34:07.060 --> 02:34:13.020]  Yeah, now that you make me think about it too much, one of his first starts was playing
[02:34:13.020 --> 02:34:14.020]  a de-aged superstar.
[02:34:14.020 --> 02:34:18.860]  And it only would look that much alike at all, but we don't care, because they're both
[02:34:18.860 --> 02:34:19.860]  good actors.
[02:34:19.860 --> 02:34:24.180]  They're both incredible actors, and they're both handsome people, but holy cow, they do
[02:34:24.180 --> 02:34:26.740]  not look like the same person even a little bit.
[02:34:26.740 --> 02:34:29.940]  It was way cheaper to just get a young guy who looks like a young guy.
[02:34:29.940 --> 02:34:30.940]  Right.
[02:34:30.940 --> 02:34:37.020]  Well, and the other funny thing about that too is, okay, we never saw young Marlon Brando
[02:34:37.020 --> 02:34:42.180]  as Vito Corleone, but everybody knows what young Marlon Brando looked like, because he
[02:34:42.180 --> 02:34:43.980]  was already...
[02:34:43.980 --> 02:34:44.980]  From a very young age.
[02:34:44.980 --> 02:34:45.980]  Yeah.
[02:34:45.980 --> 02:34:53.400]  He was built like a brick shithouse, and did not look anything like what we actually got
[02:34:53.400 --> 02:34:55.400]  to see on screen.
[02:34:55.400 --> 02:35:00.540]  But De Niro got to play the young Vito Corleone, which is not the young Marlon Brando.
[02:35:00.540 --> 02:35:01.540]  Right.
[02:35:01.540 --> 02:35:04.660]  They're both playing the same character, and just because one comes first and one comes
[02:35:04.660 --> 02:35:05.660]  second.
[02:35:05.660 --> 02:35:06.660]  Yeah.
[02:35:06.660 --> 02:35:08.220]  I totally bought him as young Vito.
[02:35:08.220 --> 02:35:09.940]  I don't care if he looks like Marlon Brando.
[02:35:09.940 --> 02:35:10.940]  Oh, totally.
[02:35:10.940 --> 02:35:11.940]  100%.
[02:35:11.940 --> 02:35:23.260]  And I think maybe we're falling into the trap of going for visual similarity, rather than
[02:35:23.260 --> 02:35:24.260]  sort of like...
[02:35:24.260 --> 02:35:29.100]  It's a cool thing you can do if you can do it, and if you can do it convincingly, and
[02:35:29.100 --> 02:35:34.500]  I think it will be a great tool to have in the tool chest, but right now, that tool falls
[02:35:34.500 --> 02:35:35.860]  short of alternate techniques.
[02:35:35.860 --> 02:35:39.580]  So use it sparingly to just advance it.
[02:35:39.580 --> 02:35:40.580]  Yeah.
[02:35:40.580 --> 02:35:41.580]  I mean, just think of it this way.
[02:35:41.580 --> 02:35:42.580]  Think of fake backgrounds.
[02:35:42.580 --> 02:35:45.820]  Think of a show like The Crown or whatever.
[02:35:45.820 --> 02:35:48.420]  You could make a show like The Crown in the 70s, and it would be fine.
[02:35:48.420 --> 02:35:52.120]  Today, we have tools in our tool belt that are so good, they're just a routine part of
[02:35:52.120 --> 02:35:56.220]  doing stuff, which is like, I'll put in Fucking Ham Palace behind there, and nobody will ever
[02:35:56.220 --> 02:35:57.220]  know.
[02:35:57.220 --> 02:35:59.180]  And it works so perfectly that it's a non-issue.
[02:35:59.180 --> 02:36:03.220]  When we get to that point, if we ever get to that point with de-aging, by all means,
[02:36:03.220 --> 02:36:04.300]  use it whenever the hell you want.
[02:36:04.300 --> 02:36:08.300]  Right now, it's not at that level, so you have to really pick and choose, because people
[02:36:08.300 --> 02:36:13.420]  are going to notice, and it is going to stand out, and you have to balance that.
[02:36:13.420 --> 02:36:16.420]  We want to keep practicing this and getting better at it so that we can get to the point
[02:36:16.420 --> 02:36:18.580]  where it's not noticeable, but right now it is.
[02:36:18.580 --> 02:36:22.940]  So let's factor that into our creative decisions and not build a three-hour movie around it.
[02:36:22.940 --> 02:36:23.940]  Can I tell you-
[02:36:23.940 --> 02:36:34.940]  So one thing, Sir Q, that I was most interested to talk to you about tonight was, you had
[02:36:34.940 --> 02:36:43.220]  a definite perspective on the arc of Luke's character, and I feel, and not to put words
[02:36:43.220 --> 02:36:50.620]  in your mouth, but I feel like you felt a little bit betrayed by The Last Jedi and his
[02:36:50.620 --> 02:36:53.660]  arc in that film.
[02:36:53.660 --> 02:36:59.500]  How does the final episode of Mandalorian season two sort of fit into that for you?
[02:36:59.500 --> 02:37:02.260]  You're going to throw that one out there when Jon's trying to close on the show?
[02:37:02.260 --> 02:37:03.260]  What is your final point, Jon?
[02:37:03.260 --> 02:37:07.260]  I'll let you get to that, and then we'll see if we have time for me to address it, guys.
[02:37:07.260 --> 02:37:09.900]  That's the most essential thing that we have to talk about.
[02:37:09.900 --> 02:37:11.500]  It's not my fault you guys are being-
[02:37:11.500 --> 02:37:14.740]  I just want to give Jon a chance, he had one final point he wanted to make.
[02:37:14.740 --> 02:37:19.860]  I just wanted to say, I wanted to just, it's a complete aside, I just want to say my favorite
[02:37:19.860 --> 02:37:26.100]  special effect of the entire two-season run of The Mandalorian was the IG, I think he's
[02:37:26.100 --> 02:37:27.100]  IG-11 droid.
[02:37:27.100 --> 02:37:28.100]  IG-11, yeah.
[02:37:28.100 --> 02:37:33.380]  And I think what made it work so perfectly, well, number one, it was just great effects
[02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:37.820]  work, but number one, or number two, it's the fact that the original IG-88 character
[02:37:37.820 --> 02:37:43.300]  was made with 1981 technology, where they built, like, well, what can we make that looks
[02:37:43.300 --> 02:37:47.500]  like a credible assassin droid, and it would look like this.
[02:37:47.500 --> 02:37:56.140]  And the mechanics of the droid that they created to make a real world slightly, I mean, IG-88
[02:37:56.140 --> 02:37:59.980]  barely moves in Return of the, or Empire Strikes Back.
[02:37:59.980 --> 02:38:02.860]  I think his head swivels, and he's got those, like-
[02:38:02.860 --> 02:38:11.620]  But it becomes this thing that is completely able to be made completely realistically in
[02:38:11.620 --> 02:38:18.220]  today's CGI, and it's just, it's like, oh, that guy moves like a herky-jerky robot.
[02:38:18.220 --> 02:38:20.940]  That's because he is a herky-jerky robot, right?
[02:38:20.940 --> 02:38:22.860]  It was, I loved that.
[02:38:22.860 --> 02:38:24.380]  I thought it was so great.
[02:38:24.380 --> 02:38:33.420]  I loved it, and just today, or maybe yesterday, Boston Dynamics put out a little video of
[02:38:33.420 --> 02:38:40.060]  the robots dancing, and I'm like, I'm sure 11 is going to be so much fun.
[02:38:40.060 --> 02:38:42.620]  Before we close, we could close on the Luke question.
[02:38:42.620 --> 02:38:46.660]  My other topic before we close on that would be, what do we think of bringing Boba Fett
[02:38:46.660 --> 02:38:47.660]  back?
[02:38:47.660 --> 02:38:49.660]  Ooh, good one.
[02:38:49.660 --> 02:38:52.020]  That was also my last.
[02:38:52.020 --> 02:38:53.020]  That's my last thing.
[02:38:53.020 --> 02:38:56.980]  There's a little bit of a De Niro effect in there that Boba's put on some weight.
[02:38:56.980 --> 02:38:58.860]  The armor doesn't fit like it used to.
[02:38:58.860 --> 02:38:59.860]  I dig it.
[02:38:59.860 --> 02:39:00.860]  I kind of dig it.
[02:39:00.860 --> 02:39:04.660]  The thing is, you can lean into that, because we're not trying to de-age him.
[02:39:04.660 --> 02:39:09.780]  We're saying, this is Boba who's been digested slightly, and he's put on some weight, and
[02:39:09.780 --> 02:39:15.420]  he's a little worse for wear, but he's still pretty cranky, and if he's a little heavier
[02:39:15.420 --> 02:39:18.700]  now and he's older, that's the character, and so go with it, and they did.
[02:39:18.700 --> 02:39:22.380]  They talked about that in the gallery thing, that they wanted to give Boba Fett a different
[02:39:22.380 --> 02:39:26.220]  fighting style than the Mandalorian, and what they ended up giving him was a fighting style
[02:39:26.220 --> 02:39:32.060]  that befits the actor who's playing him, which I think is great, because there's no established
[02:39:32.060 --> 02:39:35.780]  stuff in the universe in the existing canon of what Boba Fett's supposed to be like after
[02:39:35.780 --> 02:39:37.580]  he escapes the Sarlacc, so guess what?
[02:39:37.580 --> 02:39:38.580]  This is what he's like.
[02:39:38.580 --> 02:39:42.940]  Now, can they build a series on that gruff, tough character?
[02:39:42.940 --> 02:39:43.940]  I don't know.
[02:39:43.940 --> 02:39:44.940]  We'll see.
[02:39:44.940 --> 02:39:49.780]  Especially since he's on the Jabba throne, or on the Bib Fortuna throne, or whatever
[02:39:49.780 --> 02:39:54.380]  the throne is called, that he takes over there, I'm not sure what that series is going to
[02:39:54.380 --> 02:39:55.380]  be like.
[02:39:55.380 --> 02:39:59.300]  He doesn't seem like the type of character that you could build a series around, but
[02:39:59.300 --> 02:40:06.120]  you know, I assume the people who have that franchise have a story in mind that they want
[02:40:06.120 --> 02:40:09.620]  to tell, and my whole thing is if you have a story you want to tell in the universe,
[02:40:09.620 --> 02:40:13.500]  go for it, and if you want to use this character, feel free, because it's not like Boba Fett
[02:40:13.500 --> 02:40:17.180]  in the original trilogy is so well established that you're hemmed in.
[02:40:17.180 --> 02:40:20.060]  He's such a cipher, you can honestly do whatever the hell you want with him.
[02:40:20.060 --> 02:40:23.860]  Well, wait, you're forgetting that monologue where he describes everything that he loves,
[02:40:23.860 --> 02:40:32.860]  and being bought off one of those giant cows on Naboo, and he's just a really fully fleshed
[02:40:32.860 --> 02:40:33.860]  out character.
[02:40:33.860 --> 02:40:38.260]  I mean, the whole season should just be about him constantly reliving having his backpack
[02:40:38.260 --> 02:40:41.940]  malfunction when he gets accidentally poked in the back by Han, and he's like so embarrassed
[02:40:41.940 --> 02:40:42.940]  by that.
[02:40:42.940 --> 02:40:47.300]  There's just constant nightmares and dreams about it, and people teasing him in the street.
[02:40:47.300 --> 02:40:49.860]  And then it burped, everybody, it burped!
[02:40:49.860 --> 02:40:53.980]  And it's just how his head is down, and he's just walking.
[02:40:53.980 --> 02:40:58.060]  To answer your question, Jon, I don't care.
[02:40:58.060 --> 02:40:59.060]  I don't care.
[02:40:59.060 --> 02:41:02.460]  I like the actor, I like the character.
[02:41:02.460 --> 02:41:10.300]  When I was young, when we were young, and when Boba Fett went into that select pit,
[02:41:10.300 --> 02:41:15.460]  I felt a little ripped off because I thought he was a great character and I wanted to see
[02:41:15.460 --> 02:41:18.060]  him do more kickass stuff.
[02:41:18.060 --> 02:41:21.600]  I don't know if you guys have felt it yet, but we're old.
[02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:25.980]  I don't need to see him crawl out of a starlike pit and kick some ass.
[02:41:25.980 --> 02:41:26.980]  I don't care.
[02:41:26.980 --> 02:41:33.480]  I'm not really entirely sure where that story arc goes.
[02:41:33.480 --> 02:41:39.180]  I was more invested, oddly, because I didn't like him in the first season, but Bill Burr's
[02:41:39.180 --> 02:41:44.880]  character this season excited me more than Boba Fett.
[02:41:44.880 --> 02:41:48.620]  I did like him cracking Stormtrooper helmets open.
[02:41:48.620 --> 02:41:49.620]  That was cool.
[02:41:49.620 --> 02:41:53.780]  Yeah, I think it's the first time we've seen Stormtrooper armor shattered and fragmented.
[02:41:53.780 --> 02:41:57.580]  We've seen it burned and we've seen it get bashed a lot but then bounce off, but this
[02:41:57.580 --> 02:42:00.980]  is the first time we've actually seen it shatter like the plastic we know it is.
[02:42:00.980 --> 02:42:06.020]  I was dying for that to be the episode where armor actually worked.
[02:42:06.020 --> 02:42:09.540]  Like have a rock explode and have rocks bounce off of their armor.
[02:42:09.540 --> 02:42:10.540]  Do something!
[02:42:10.540 --> 02:42:13.740]  My family was asking about this too, and my in-universe explanation, which may or may
[02:42:13.740 --> 02:42:18.500]  not be supported by the materials, is we know the Empire cheaps out on its crap.
[02:42:18.500 --> 02:42:20.580]  It's why there's no atmosphere in TIE fighters.
[02:42:20.580 --> 02:42:22.600]  It's not giving these people the best armor.
[02:42:22.600 --> 02:42:28.060]  It's better than no armor in that maybe you'll take a couple rocks from an Ewok and not die,
[02:42:28.060 --> 02:42:29.660]  but it's not going to stop a blaster.
[02:42:29.660 --> 02:42:30.660]  Right, yeah.
[02:42:30.660 --> 02:42:34.780]  You may get knocked out or knocked down, but you're out of the fight.
[02:42:34.780 --> 02:42:39.620]  Or maybe they cheat about so much that it's just like, quote unquote, armor and they just
[02:42:39.620 --> 02:42:41.820]  want these guys to look terrifying.
[02:42:41.820 --> 02:42:45.300]  If you wore it on a motorcycle, it would keep your skin from being scraped off by the asphalt.
[02:42:45.300 --> 02:42:46.700]  It's more like motorcycle armor.
[02:42:46.700 --> 02:42:49.300]  It's like, yeah, it's some protection.
[02:42:49.300 --> 02:42:52.340]  If you punch it with a bare fist, you're going to be glad you've got that helmet on.
[02:42:52.340 --> 02:42:56.500]  But if you have a big metal stick with a pointy thing at the end or a blaster, you get problems.
[02:42:56.500 --> 02:42:57.500]  My only complaint-
[02:42:57.500 --> 02:43:00.860]  Even if we had a scene with Finn saying like, you know what, that armor is just so that
[02:43:00.860 --> 02:43:04.200]  we feel empowered so we can go kill people.
[02:43:04.200 --> 02:43:09.500]  Like it doesn't, they 3D print this stuff off the line and it doesn't do anything.
[02:43:09.500 --> 02:43:12.540]  It doesn't keep out chemicals, or it keeps out smoke, but not chemicals.
[02:43:12.540 --> 02:43:15.660]  Wasn't that one of the lines in one of the movies that like, you know-
[02:43:15.660 --> 02:43:16.660]  Something, yeah, something like that.
[02:43:16.660 --> 02:43:18.020]  Like that, which doesn't make sense.
[02:43:18.020 --> 02:43:22.060]  It's just like, you know what, we wear the armor so that we feel scary and powerful.
[02:43:22.060 --> 02:43:23.060]  Just say that.
[02:43:23.060 --> 02:43:25.340]  And so they can't see we're all the same person.
[02:43:25.340 --> 02:43:28.980]  Because at this point it's getting extra, extra stupid.
[02:43:28.980 --> 02:43:32.980]  But should Boba Fett have a show?
[02:43:32.980 --> 02:43:33.980]  Sure.
[02:43:33.980 --> 02:43:35.220]  Maybe more people get employed.
[02:43:35.220 --> 02:43:36.220]  That's awesome.
[02:43:36.220 --> 02:43:38.940]  But I think they've already said it's a limited run, right?
[02:43:38.940 --> 02:43:41.980]  Like they're just going to do six episodes and that's it.
[02:43:41.980 --> 02:43:44.460]  And I can say, I say go for it.
[02:43:44.460 --> 02:43:50.420]  I like the idea that he's a fringe character and it's not one of, even though he's beloved,
[02:43:50.420 --> 02:43:54.460]  like super beloved, it's a fringe character.
[02:43:54.460 --> 02:43:55.700]  He's a guy with a helmet.
[02:43:55.700 --> 02:44:00.580]  So there's no need for worrying about the aging thing.
[02:44:00.580 --> 02:44:02.540]  You know, I liked that they hired the guy.
[02:44:02.540 --> 02:44:04.140]  You know, and sure.
[02:44:04.140 --> 02:44:05.140]  It does look like he-
[02:44:05.140 --> 02:44:08.460]  Well, the original guy, Jeremy Bullock, died right before-
[02:44:08.460 --> 02:44:09.460]  No, but they hired-
[02:44:09.460 --> 02:44:10.460]  Yeah.
[02:44:10.460 --> 02:44:11.460]  They're having the prequels, yeah.
[02:44:11.460 --> 02:44:12.460]  Yeah, I know.
[02:44:12.460 --> 02:44:14.340]  I'm trying to shoehorn in a mention of Jeremy Bullock.
[02:44:14.340 --> 02:44:15.340]  That's all.
[02:44:15.340 --> 02:44:16.340]  Right.
[02:44:16.340 --> 02:44:18.660]  But, you know, and you know, it's all right.
[02:44:18.660 --> 02:44:22.180]  They've already, you know, there was the whole, you know, you never saw him without his helmet.
[02:44:22.180 --> 02:44:26.540]  But you know, if they took off Darth Vader's helmet back in Return of the Jedi, they could
[02:44:26.540 --> 02:44:27.820]  take off anybody's helmet.
[02:44:27.820 --> 02:44:28.820]  So I'm fine with it.
[02:44:28.820 --> 02:44:29.820]  I'm going to, you know.
[02:44:29.820 --> 02:44:35.140]  I think 10 years ago, me would have been upset about it, and I'm like, eh, let's see.
[02:44:35.140 --> 02:44:36.140]  Cool.
[02:44:36.140 --> 02:44:38.740]  Yeah, I mean, like I said, if you think you have a story to tell, go for it.
[02:44:38.740 --> 02:44:39.740]  These characters aren't precious.
[02:44:39.740 --> 02:44:40.740]  Yeah.
[02:44:40.740 --> 02:44:41.740]  Like, it's fine.
[02:44:41.740 --> 02:44:42.740]  I like it.
[02:44:42.740 --> 02:44:43.740]  I feel like he's in good hands.
[02:44:43.740 --> 02:44:45.340]  I like it.
[02:44:45.340 --> 02:44:49.800]  I like the idea that the first thing he did when he got his stuff back together is go
[02:44:49.800 --> 02:44:51.340]  kill Bib Fortuna.
[02:44:51.340 --> 02:44:52.340]  Yeah.
[02:44:52.340 --> 02:44:53.340]  Yeah.
[02:44:53.340 --> 02:44:54.340]  I love it.
[02:44:54.340 --> 02:44:55.340]  I never liked that guy.
[02:44:55.340 --> 02:45:01.180]  I love that Bib Fortuna is put on like a hundred some-odd pounds, just because it's like, I
[02:45:01.180 --> 02:45:02.180]  don't have to.
[02:45:02.180 --> 02:45:03.180]  You get on that throne, and the pounds just come on.
[02:45:03.180 --> 02:45:04.780]  You just eat frog after frog.
[02:45:04.780 --> 02:45:05.780]  Yeah.
[02:45:05.780 --> 02:45:06.780]  All right.
[02:45:06.780 --> 02:45:07.780]  I kind of like that.
[02:45:07.780 --> 02:45:08.780]  It's, yeah.
[02:45:08.780 --> 02:45:09.780]  Let's wrap up.
[02:45:09.780 --> 02:45:10.780]  It's decadence.
[02:45:10.780 --> 02:45:11.780]  It's a sign of decadence, which is fun.
[02:45:11.780 --> 02:45:14.820]  Let's wrap up and revisit Guy's question about Luke's arc.
[02:45:14.820 --> 02:45:18.900]  Good, because I really, I think this is a pertinent question, and I think it goes to
[02:45:18.900 --> 02:45:19.900]  the hardest to watch.
[02:45:19.900 --> 02:45:24.980]  I mean, I think it's less pertinent than you think it is, but just to review, my problem
[02:45:24.980 --> 02:45:25.980]  with
[02:45:25.980 --> 02:45:26.980]  You've been telling me that for like 30 years now.
[02:45:26.980 --> 02:45:27.980]  Come on.
[02:45:27.980 --> 02:45:34.620]  My problem with Luke in The Last Jedi has almost nothing to do with what you see Luke
[02:45:34.620 --> 02:45:38.120]  doing in present day in The Last Jedi, but everything to do with the flashback in which
[02:45:38.120 --> 02:45:43.220]  we are led to believe that he seriously considered killing the son of his best friend Han Solo
[02:45:43.220 --> 02:45:47.500]  because he sensed the dark side in him, and nothing we had seen on screen up to that point
[02:45:47.500 --> 02:45:54.220]  or since took us from the Luke at the end of Jedi to the Luke who would make that consideration.
[02:45:54.220 --> 02:45:58.980]  Luke couldn't even consider fighting, let alone killing his own father who had blown
[02:45:58.980 --> 02:46:01.260]  up entire planets, right?
[02:46:01.260 --> 02:46:05.700]  And suddenly he's going to consider killing Han Solo's son because he's an innocent child,
[02:46:05.700 --> 02:46:09.100]  because he sort of senses the dark side in him a little, because we know Luke is so afraid
[02:46:09.100 --> 02:46:12.220]  of the dark side, and if he ever meets anyone who has the dark side, he will kill them immediately.
[02:46:12.220 --> 02:46:13.220]  No, he won't.
[02:46:13.220 --> 02:46:14.220]  He absolutely won't.
[02:46:14.220 --> 02:46:15.580]  So that did not fit with his character.
[02:46:15.580 --> 02:46:20.420]  Now, I'm not saying that can never happen, but you have to build the story pieces, taking
[02:46:20.420 --> 02:46:23.780]  me from the Luke at the end of Jedi to the Luke that considers killing his son.
[02:46:23.780 --> 02:46:27.700]  I have no problem getting to the Luke who's bitter on the island.
[02:46:27.700 --> 02:46:30.980]  That's super easy, because you can just do that with, like, well, I tried to train a
[02:46:30.980 --> 02:46:31.980]  bunch of people.
[02:46:31.980 --> 02:46:32.980]  It didn't work out.
[02:46:32.980 --> 02:46:33.980]  I blew it.
[02:46:33.980 --> 02:46:34.980]  I'm super sad about it.
[02:46:34.980 --> 02:46:35.980]  Now I'm bitter on this island.
[02:46:35.980 --> 02:46:38.700]  They told that story, but the how did you get there?
[02:46:38.700 --> 02:46:40.980]  Oh, I was thinking about killing Han's son.
[02:46:40.980 --> 02:46:41.980]  Nope.
[02:46:41.980 --> 02:46:44.380]  Luke would not do that, and that is my giant objection.
[02:46:44.380 --> 02:46:45.380]  Right.
[02:46:45.380 --> 02:46:50.260]  So I think Luke on the island from Luke at Return of the Jedi, you can do a linear interpolation
[02:46:50.260 --> 02:46:51.260]  there, right?
[02:46:51.260 --> 02:46:54.260]  Yeah, because you know that the whole Jedi schooling thing didn't go well.
[02:46:54.260 --> 02:46:55.260]  It totally screwed up.
[02:46:55.260 --> 02:46:58.680]  He's super pissed and bitter about it, and that's a thing you can imagine happening.
[02:46:58.680 --> 02:47:01.700]  But in the midpoint, you try to kill your nephew?
[02:47:01.700 --> 02:47:06.500]  Yeah, but you know he's mostly a good-hearted person who feels bad, like Yoda in some respects.
[02:47:06.500 --> 02:47:11.020]  Yoda sort of went off on his own and was a little eccentric in his little hidey-hole
[02:47:11.020 --> 02:47:13.020]  on Dagobah and everything.
[02:47:13.020 --> 02:47:14.020]  Right.
[02:47:14.020 --> 02:47:15.020]  A little.
[02:47:15.020 --> 02:47:16.020]  A little.
[02:47:16.020 --> 02:47:20.220]  Yeah, but so did Obi-Wan, and that's a little bit of my explanation for Luke and the last
[02:47:20.220 --> 02:47:21.220]  Jedi to say.
[02:47:21.220 --> 02:47:25.460]  Everything you learned is like from these two guys who just basically ran away and hid.
[02:47:25.460 --> 02:47:36.420]  Now here's the thing, Luke at the end of the Mandalorian season two is very much a deus
[02:47:36.420 --> 02:47:38.100]  ex machina, right?
[02:47:38.100 --> 02:47:43.420]  He just comes in, he swoops in, he murders all of the bad robots, and he takes the kid
[02:47:43.420 --> 02:47:45.060]  and he books.
[02:47:45.060 --> 02:47:50.540]  A little bit polite, but if anybody had argued with him, you'd get the sense he was still
[02:47:50.540 --> 02:47:55.580]  going to take that kid.
[02:47:55.580 --> 02:47:59.500]  How does that fit into your interpretation of Luke between point A and point B?
[02:47:59.500 --> 02:48:01.340]  So Luke's doing a star cameo in this.
[02:48:01.340 --> 02:48:03.940]  So first of all, it's the Luke from basically the end of Jedi.
[02:48:03.940 --> 02:48:05.780]  He's wearing the same freaking outfit, right?
[02:48:05.780 --> 02:48:06.780]  He looks the same.
[02:48:06.780 --> 02:48:09.780]  Which he's all black, by the way.
[02:48:09.780 --> 02:48:10.900]  I think we disagree on this.
[02:48:10.900 --> 02:48:16.780]  I think Luke in Jedi was more Darkseid than I think you do.
[02:48:16.780 --> 02:48:21.860]  Ultimately his whole battle was against being tempted to the Darkseid, because he so wanted
[02:48:21.860 --> 02:48:25.780]  to have a relationship with his father that he was willing to consider that, but no, I
[02:48:25.780 --> 02:48:26.780]  have to resist.
[02:48:26.780 --> 02:48:28.780]  Anyway, we're not going back into the Jedi.
[02:48:28.780 --> 02:48:30.180]  Ultimately he throws it aside, right?
[02:48:30.180 --> 02:48:35.420]  But I think that it is inherent in his character that he's tempted to go that way, and I think
[02:48:35.420 --> 02:48:36.420]  that this episode...
[02:48:36.420 --> 02:48:39.500]  I mean, he's not really tempted to go that way, it's just that he wants to save his friends
[02:48:39.500 --> 02:48:40.500]  so much.
[02:48:40.500 --> 02:48:42.780]  The Emperor is trying to turn his goodness against them.
[02:48:42.780 --> 02:48:46.000]  It's not as if he ever considers being evil, because that might be cool, but he really
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.300]  wants to save his father, and he really wants to save his friends.
[02:48:48.300 --> 02:48:52.100]  And also he's a young hothead, he's a young man who's pissed off that, you know, your
[02:48:52.100 --> 02:48:53.700]  friends out there on the moon...
[02:48:53.700 --> 02:48:54.700]  Like, just... anyway.
[02:48:54.700 --> 02:48:55.700]  I don't want to talk about Jedi.
[02:48:55.700 --> 02:48:56.700]  Sure, sure, sure.
[02:48:56.700 --> 02:48:59.700]  But if those dark troopers hadn't been robots and they'd been people, would there be any
[02:48:59.700 --> 02:49:00.700]  less dead?
[02:49:00.700 --> 02:49:01.700]  All right.
[02:49:01.700 --> 02:49:06.500]  So the Luke that comes up here, like, he got the phone call from Grogu.
[02:49:06.500 --> 02:49:12.100]  This call went out, hey, I'm a little Jedi, I'm just a baby Jedi with so much potential.
[02:49:12.100 --> 02:49:15.060]  There's a reference nobody will get.
[02:49:15.060 --> 02:49:16.060]  You don't get this.
[02:49:16.060 --> 02:49:17.060]  Stop laughing.
[02:49:17.060 --> 02:49:18.060]  You do not get that reference.
[02:49:18.060 --> 02:49:19.060]  I don't care.
[02:49:19.060 --> 02:49:22.940]  It's funny that you think that there are people out there that would get that reference.
[02:49:22.940 --> 02:49:26.740]  There are at least five people listening to this who understand what that's a reference
[02:49:26.740 --> 02:49:27.740]  to.
[02:49:27.740 --> 02:49:31.500]  So Luke is making a star cameo in the 70s TV show style.
[02:49:31.500 --> 02:49:36.900]  Ooh, a big star is going to show up for one episode in, say, a couple of lines, right?
[02:49:36.900 --> 02:49:39.540]  It's established that, you know, the whole arc is we've got to find something to do with
[02:49:39.540 --> 02:49:40.540]  this baby Yoda.
[02:49:40.540 --> 02:49:41.540]  I can't deal with him.
[02:49:41.540 --> 02:49:42.540]  I need a Jedi.
[02:49:42.540 --> 02:49:44.900]  Ahsoka says, no, I'm too busy doing the Thrawn thing.
[02:49:44.900 --> 02:49:47.220]  Give me a phone call, see who answers.
[02:49:47.220 --> 02:49:48.860]  Luke answers.
[02:49:48.860 --> 02:49:54.260]  He's coming in, and he's like a Jedi, a full-fledged Jedi.
[02:49:54.260 --> 02:50:01.880]  What he's up against is a chicken man with the darksaber, who is not a Jedi by any stretch
[02:50:01.880 --> 02:50:04.940]  of the imagination and isn't even really good with the darksaber.
[02:50:04.940 --> 02:50:06.940]  I love that you called him chicken man.
[02:50:06.940 --> 02:50:12.540]  Plus, I mean, I guess he's in the boys, too.
[02:50:12.540 --> 02:50:21.300]  Plus, a whole bunch of, like, rank and file, you know, Empire people, and then the robots,
[02:50:21.300 --> 02:50:22.620]  the big killer robots, right?
[02:50:22.620 --> 02:50:25.940]  Now, it's not like the robots just showed up to be cannon fodder for him.
[02:50:25.940 --> 02:50:27.060]  The robots were established.
[02:50:27.060 --> 02:50:28.060]  This was his big tool.
[02:50:28.060 --> 02:50:29.340]  Like, I've got these robots.
[02:50:29.340 --> 02:50:33.020]  I've got some crappy troops and, you know, whatever.
[02:50:33.020 --> 02:50:34.020]  They're not great, right?
[02:50:34.020 --> 02:50:36.700]  I mean, the Empire is not what it used to be, first of all, and second of all, they're
[02:50:36.700 --> 02:50:39.380]  never really good, but I've got this tech, right?
[02:50:39.380 --> 02:50:40.860]  And so that's my big thing.
[02:50:40.860 --> 02:50:44.140]  And so I don't feel like they're set up there so Luke doesn't have to kill real people to
[02:50:44.140 --> 02:50:45.980]  come in and get Grogu.
[02:50:45.980 --> 02:50:52.160]  That's just what he's got, and they're actually pretty tough if you're not a Jedi, right?
[02:50:52.160 --> 02:50:55.780]  And so he flies in, and, you know, they're not even on a real Star Destroyer.
[02:50:55.780 --> 02:50:56.780]  What is it?
[02:50:56.780 --> 02:51:01.100]  The light cruiser, whatever little thing?
[02:51:01.100 --> 02:51:06.120]  No problem for him to show up, stroll in there fairly casually.
[02:51:06.120 --> 02:51:11.020]  That's threat, you know, his lightsaber goes through them perfectly well, right?
[02:51:11.020 --> 02:51:12.020]  Yeah.
[02:51:12.020 --> 02:51:13.020]  And all they can do is shoot at him.
[02:51:13.020 --> 02:51:18.260]  And we've seen Jedi destroy droids with shields and all kinds of stuff, that's not a problem.
[02:51:18.260 --> 02:51:20.660]  The more complicated, you know, anyway, I'll finish this up.
[02:51:20.660 --> 02:51:23.060]  Yeah, the more complicated the droid is, the more the droids get.
[02:51:23.060 --> 02:51:25.780]  No, I was going to say, the more complicated thing in the Star Wars universe is how droids
[02:51:25.780 --> 02:51:29.420]  are treated, which Solo touches upon, but anyway.
[02:51:29.420 --> 02:51:33.940]  The dark troopers seem to not even really be particularly sentient or particularly smart,
[02:51:33.940 --> 02:51:38.420]  so he strolls in, he gets the baby Yoda, he doesn't have to have a lot of lines, he doesn't
[02:51:38.420 --> 02:51:42.120]  know these people, he's, we know what projects he's undertaking.
[02:51:42.120 --> 02:51:46.540]  He is like, we defeated the Empire, now I'm going to start up training Jedi again.
[02:51:46.540 --> 02:51:47.540]  You go do that, Luke.
[02:51:47.540 --> 02:51:49.920]  It's not going to turn out well, but you don't know that yet, right?
[02:51:49.920 --> 02:51:51.800]  So he comes and he goes.
[02:51:51.800 --> 02:51:55.360]  And his character, he doesn't do anything out of character, because he's coming in to
[02:51:55.360 --> 02:51:59.360]  rescue somebody, which is a thing that Luke would do, because he's a gooder, and the fact
[02:51:59.360 --> 02:52:04.020]  that he answered, is because he's Luke, like he always answers, his friends are in danger,
[02:52:04.020 --> 02:52:07.680]  he leaves and goes to Cloud City, he's supposed to finish his training, he's got to save his
[02:52:07.680 --> 02:52:08.680]  friends.
[02:52:08.680 --> 02:52:13.260]  That's totally a Luke thing to do, killing the robots on the way in, no problem.
[02:52:13.260 --> 02:52:16.660]  That's perfectly in keeping with the Jedi, Luke, as far as I'm concerned.
[02:52:16.660 --> 02:52:23.060]  I like it because it's internally consistent, where the argument is, well, why didn't Yoda
[02:52:23.060 --> 02:52:27.340]  and Ben Kenobi know that baby Grogu was out there?
[02:52:27.340 --> 02:52:30.180]  Well they didn't know, they thought he had gotten, maybe he'd gotten killed, they couldn't
[02:52:30.180 --> 02:52:34.260]  sense him, they don't have that, the force isn't that sensitive, like, they could keep
[02:52:34.260 --> 02:52:38.100]  track of Luke, because they knew to keep track of Luke, but they didn't.
[02:52:38.100 --> 02:52:42.340]  And then, you know, why didn't Luke find baby Grogu earlier?
[02:52:42.340 --> 02:52:50.360]  Well, he didn't know either, but then there's this magic altar, and baby Grogu has a religious
[02:52:50.360 --> 02:52:54.780]  moment on it, and it sends the bat signal up, and Luke hears it.
[02:52:54.780 --> 02:52:55.780]  I like it.
[02:52:55.780 --> 02:52:58.060]  Yeah, I'm okay with that.
[02:52:58.060 --> 02:52:59.060]  Yeah.
[02:52:59.060 --> 02:53:05.940]  I think there is a, it's, I mean, for lack of a better terminology, there's like, Li
[02:53:05.940 --> 02:53:07.260]  lines on the earth, right?
[02:53:07.260 --> 02:53:10.820]  Like where there was like, magic lines that intersect at a certain point, you take them
[02:53:10.820 --> 02:53:14.900]  to this part of the galaxy, he's going to be able to talk to people, Jedi can't talk
[02:53:14.900 --> 02:53:19.540]  to each other because the Sith have basically messed us all up, seriously, like even in
[02:53:19.540 --> 02:53:23.580]  the prequels, they're like, we can't see the future, we don't know what's going on, things
[02:53:23.580 --> 02:53:25.580]  are bad.
[02:53:25.580 --> 02:53:29.740]  And so it makes sense to me for that.
[02:53:29.740 --> 02:53:35.500]  I don't know how you felt, but when Luke took Grogu, I felt sad.
[02:53:35.500 --> 02:53:38.540]  Yeah, I said that, I felt really sad.
[02:53:38.540 --> 02:53:39.540]  Yeah.
[02:53:39.540 --> 02:53:42.500]  And that is the hero for my youth.
[02:53:42.500 --> 02:53:43.500]  Yeah.
[02:53:43.500 --> 02:53:48.380]  But it is a sad parting, but like, the whole deal, the whole Mandalorian's whole arc is
[02:53:48.380 --> 02:53:52.880]  like, if you were rooting for the Mandalorian, just adopt baby Yoda, he'll be your baby,
[02:53:52.880 --> 02:53:56.980]  like that's never gonna happen, because he can't give baby Yoda what baby Yoda needs.
[02:53:56.980 --> 02:54:00.960]  Like the thing that he needs to do, if baby Yoda is to fulfill his potential, is to give
[02:54:00.960 --> 02:54:03.060]  him to someone who understands his force crap.
[02:54:03.060 --> 02:54:06.900]  And it's going to be sad when you leave him, but that's what's best for the baby.
[02:54:06.900 --> 02:54:07.900]  So he's doing what's best.
[02:54:07.900 --> 02:54:13.580]  I agree with you, and I think season three is going to reverse that decision.
[02:54:13.580 --> 02:54:14.580]  I don't know.
[02:54:14.580 --> 02:54:18.780]  I mean, it depends on how, like, I think it would be a wise choice to, because again,
[02:54:18.780 --> 02:54:23.580]  we know what happens with Luke's training, it doesn't go well.
[02:54:23.580 --> 02:54:26.660]  I don't think you can keep bringing it, cycling baby Yoda back in, like you can't put him
[02:54:26.660 --> 02:54:29.820]  in peril again and then rescue him and put him in peril and rescue him.
[02:54:29.820 --> 02:54:31.320]  I think he just goes off.
[02:54:31.320 --> 02:54:35.500]  I think he goes off and just abandons Jedi stuff and hangs out with Mando.
[02:54:35.500 --> 02:54:41.020]  Meanwhile, Bob Iger's watching the sales of baby Yoda-related merch at them, and he's
[02:54:41.020 --> 02:54:42.940]  picking up the phone calls like, look, you guys...
[02:54:42.940 --> 02:54:44.700]  Can we get that baby Yoda back in?
[02:54:44.700 --> 02:54:46.700]  The kid stays in the picture.
[02:54:46.700 --> 02:54:52.220]  John Favreau baby, hey, you could do what you want to do, but you got to get me some
[02:54:52.220 --> 02:54:53.220]  baby Yoda.
[02:54:53.220 --> 02:55:00.940]  Do you know what I love about that phone call is that Favreau is so much the goose that
[02:55:00.940 --> 02:55:04.300]  has laid so many golden eggs for that company.
[02:55:04.300 --> 02:55:09.380]  He's basically created the MCU, and now he's rebooted Star Wars.
[02:55:09.380 --> 02:55:10.380]  He's a made man.
[02:55:10.380 --> 02:55:11.380]  He's got to be a made man.
[02:55:11.380 --> 02:55:17.300]  And it's like, okay, so John, I hear you're writing off baby Yoda.
[02:55:17.300 --> 02:55:18.300]  I love the way you...
[02:55:18.300 --> 02:55:19.300]  That's cool.
[02:55:19.300 --> 02:55:20.300]  That's really cool.
[02:55:20.300 --> 02:55:21.300]  I love it.
[02:55:21.300 --> 02:55:22.300]  Anything you want, buddy.
[02:55:22.300 --> 02:55:27.420]  Meanwhile, he's already launched this successfully with this blockbuster hit show, launched the
[02:55:27.420 --> 02:55:32.400]  single most important thing Disney has done strategically in the whole internet era, which
[02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:35.420]  is Disney Plus, and made it a must subscribe thing.
[02:55:35.420 --> 02:55:39.900]  And it's like, he's already done his thing, but it's like, you can't take your foot off
[02:55:39.900 --> 02:55:42.740]  the gas pedal on the baby Yoda toys and pajamas.
[02:55:42.740 --> 02:55:43.740]  I know.
[02:55:43.740 --> 02:55:44.740]  I love that conversation.
[02:55:44.740 --> 02:55:49.340]  I'm going to make a Jedi Babies animated series with just all the little younglings.
[02:55:49.340 --> 02:55:50.780]  Have you guys ever seen The Chef Show?
[02:55:50.780 --> 02:55:52.780]  I think it's on Netflix.
[02:55:52.780 --> 02:55:55.220]  It's really good.
[02:55:55.220 --> 02:55:57.500]  I know I've shared a link with you group, but it's good.
[02:55:57.500 --> 02:55:58.500]  It's really good.
[02:55:58.500 --> 02:55:59.500]  It's just Favreau.
[02:55:59.500 --> 02:56:04.260]  All I can say, I've got a three and a half year old niece, and all I can say is, for
[02:56:04.260 --> 02:56:09.580]  that demographic, you couldn't put baby Yoda on enough stuff.
[02:56:09.580 --> 02:56:12.180]  I don't even know if kids use lunch boxes anymore.
[02:56:12.180 --> 02:56:16.860]  You could just bring back lunch boxes, and if it's got Grogu on it, it's going to sell.
[02:56:16.860 --> 02:56:17.860]  Everything.
[02:56:17.860 --> 02:56:19.860]  The baby Yoda all the way down.
[02:56:19.860 --> 02:56:24.980]  Anyway, I'm going to call that a spectacular.
[02:56:24.980 --> 02:56:25.980]  That was great.
[02:56:25.980 --> 02:56:29.720]  You guys, I appreciate your time so much.
[02:56:29.720 --> 02:56:30.720]  This was a lot of fun for me.
[02:56:30.720 --> 02:56:34.860]  It turned out as good as I could imagine, maybe a little longer, but what are we going
[02:56:34.860 --> 02:56:35.860]  to do?
[02:56:35.860 --> 02:56:36.860]  What are you talking about, dude?
[02:56:36.860 --> 02:56:37.860]  We're under three hours.
[02:56:37.860 --> 02:56:41.140]  If you want to take out your pee break, it'll be comfortably under three hours.
[02:56:41.140 --> 02:56:43.860]  Yeah, it's not our fault.
[02:56:43.860 --> 02:56:44.860]  We were here to work.
[02:56:44.860 --> 02:56:46.460]  You phoned it in a little bit.
[02:56:46.460 --> 02:56:49.620]  I couldn't be happier, honestly, overall.
[02:56:49.620 --> 02:56:53.420]  I don't love The Mandalorian.
[02:56:53.420 --> 02:56:58.700]  I think there are a lot of people who like it more than I do, but it is more than good
[02:56:58.700 --> 02:57:01.860]  enough for me to say, hey, this is a treat.
[02:57:01.860 --> 02:57:04.660]  I really look forward to it every Friday.
[02:57:04.660 --> 02:57:05.660]  Can't wait for season three.
[02:57:05.660 --> 02:57:11.300]  I think they're doing a great job, and it makes me happy, basically, that Star Wars
[02:57:11.300 --> 02:57:12.300]  is in good hands.
[02:57:12.300 --> 02:57:13.300]  I like it.
[02:57:13.300 --> 02:57:14.300]  Me too.
[02:57:14.300 --> 02:57:17.300]  It's not my Star Wars, but I don't make Star Wars, and I'm glad that somebody is making
[02:57:17.300 --> 02:57:19.060]  very good Star Wars stories.
[02:57:19.060 --> 02:57:25.660]  Yeah, I will echo that I really, really enjoyed The Mandalorian, season two.
[02:57:25.660 --> 02:57:30.540]  It's very different than season one, and I suspect and I hope that season three will
[02:57:30.540 --> 02:57:32.740]  be different.
[02:57:32.740 --> 02:57:37.500]  I hope that some of these new shows pick up on sort of what the promise of The Mandalorian
[02:57:37.500 --> 02:57:45.180]  season one was, which was a band of people that are not attached to Luke Skywalker at
[02:57:45.180 --> 02:57:52.380]  some point, or like the greater gist of the universe, although I know there's a strong
[02:57:52.380 --> 02:57:58.260]  gravity well that will draw all of these stories together.
[02:57:58.260 --> 02:58:04.420]  The other thing I want to say is happy birthday, John Siracusa.
[02:58:04.420 --> 02:58:06.060]  We already did that three hours ago, but thank you.
[02:58:06.060 --> 02:58:07.060]  Yeah, I know.
[02:58:07.060 --> 02:58:10.820]  It's three hours later, and we're getting there.
[02:58:10.820 --> 02:58:13.380]  We're like an hour away, so anyway.
[02:58:13.380 --> 02:58:14.800]  All right.
[02:58:14.800 --> 02:58:15.800]  Thank you, fellas.
[02:58:15.800 --> 02:58:18.060]  Thanks to our sponsors, Squarespace and Field.
[02:58:18.060 --> 02:58:19.060]  What else?
[02:58:19.060 --> 02:58:20.060]  Siracusa, did you say good?
[02:58:20.060 --> 02:58:22.100]  I don't think you got a final word.
[02:58:22.100 --> 02:58:24.500]  I think I said plenty of words.
[02:58:24.500 --> 02:58:25.900]  More Star Wars is good.
[02:58:25.900 --> 02:58:26.900]  Really?
[02:58:26.900 --> 02:58:27.900]  Are you telling me?
[02:58:27.900 --> 02:58:31.740]  Are you telling me after all of these years of knowing you that you're tapping out and
[02:58:31.740 --> 02:58:32.740]  you don't have any more words?
[02:58:32.740 --> 02:58:33.740]  I don't have opening statements.
[02:58:33.740 --> 02:58:35.500]  I don't usually have closing statements.
[02:58:35.500 --> 02:58:36.500]  Star Wars is good.
[02:58:36.500 --> 02:58:37.500]  Let's make more good Star Wars.
[02:58:37.500 --> 02:58:38.500]  The end.
[02:58:38.500 --> 02:58:39.500]  There we go.
[02:58:39.500 --> 02:58:40.500]  My God.
[02:58:40.500 --> 02:58:41.500]  Love this guy.
[02:58:41.500 --> 02:58:42.500]  What show are you guys looking more forward to?
[02:58:42.500 --> 02:58:44.860]  Boba Fett's show, the Obi-Wan show, or the Ahsoka Tonobu?
[02:58:44.860 --> 02:58:45.860]  Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[02:58:45.860 --> 02:58:46.860]  He's my guy.
[02:58:46.860 --> 02:58:49.500]  I don't know.
[02:58:49.500 --> 02:58:54.220]  I would have said the Ahsoka show, but maybe Obi-Wan.
[02:58:54.220 --> 02:58:55.220]  I can't really decide.
[02:58:55.220 --> 02:58:57.020]  Really, honestly, it depends on which show has better writing.
[02:58:57.020 --> 02:59:02.940]  I love that there's so many shows that I can pick and choose favorites among them, and
[02:59:02.940 --> 02:59:07.140]  I just want to see who's got the best writing team.
[02:59:07.140 --> 02:59:11.140]  For television, that's almost all that I care about because the effects are going to be
[02:59:11.140 --> 02:59:12.140]  fine.
[02:59:12.140 --> 02:59:13.900]  I know the actors can all act.
[02:59:13.900 --> 02:59:15.660]  I think it will all be great.
[02:59:15.660 --> 02:59:17.220]  Give me some good writing.
[02:59:17.220 --> 02:59:20.140]  I think that's the key to The Mandalorian, honestly.
[02:59:20.140 --> 02:59:24.700]  It's the best thing about it is that it's a well-written show, and I agree.
[02:59:24.700 --> 02:59:31.580]  It's so good to see that they respected that, and it didn't just figure out, hey, we'll
[02:59:31.580 --> 02:59:35.380]  put some lasers and some spaceships and call it a show.
[02:59:35.380 --> 02:59:42.220]  Well, speaking about Favreau, I think that guy could retire just on having pushed for
[02:59:42.220 --> 02:59:48.420]  and made possible the volume that they used to film the stuff in.
[02:59:48.420 --> 02:59:54.320]  That insight alone of being able to do this kind of stuff in camera with a virtual stage
[02:59:54.320 --> 02:59:56.700]  is brilliant.
[02:59:56.700 --> 02:59:57.700]  It's amazing.
[02:59:57.700 --> 03:00:04.860]  It is a remarkable leap in filmmaking, and my hat's off to everybody involved in that.
[03:00:04.860 --> 03:00:06.940]  It's really, really, really cool.
[03:00:06.940 --> 03:00:12.300]  And I think it unlocks all of these other shows because you couldn't shoot them on location.
[03:00:12.300 --> 03:00:20.380]  It would cost far too much, but now we've got, what, five, six shows that are within
[03:00:20.380 --> 03:00:21.780]  reason to create.
[03:00:21.780 --> 03:00:32.680]  And I think when things get cheaper to make, we often see higher-quality outcomes because
[03:00:32.680 --> 03:00:34.300]  you can take more risks.
[03:00:34.300 --> 03:00:35.860]  Well said, guy.
[03:00:35.860 --> 03:00:36.860]  All right.
[03:00:36.860 --> 03:00:38.260]  Merry New Year to you all.
[03:00:38.260 --> 03:00:52.940]  I'm going to call that a show.
