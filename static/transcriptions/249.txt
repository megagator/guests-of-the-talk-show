[00:00.000 --> 00:04.720]  you've been away for a bit i've been away and uh and then peter and i spent the whole time talking
[00:04.720 --> 00:14.400]  just about the media event and guillermo rambo at 9 to 5 mac uncovered 67 things that are going
[00:14.400 --> 00:22.080]  to be announced at wwbc yeah uh we could save that for later i guess okay okay i don't know
[00:22.080 --> 00:30.160]  i think we have i should have made notes but that's karen asked me what i was going to be
[00:30.160 --> 00:35.600]  talking about today and they said i don't know he usually sends me notes 15 minutes before we start
[00:35.600 --> 00:40.640]  i don't even have those notes i do have i actually do have a note but it has no news in it has a bit
[00:40.640 --> 00:47.680]  of follow-up uh i think it was paul and i were on yeah i'm doing follow-up john yeah do they do that
[00:47.680 --> 00:52.480]  first yeah yeah you got to get that out of the way yeah some people just tune in for the follow-up
[00:52.480 --> 00:56.320]  and then they turn off the episode right because then they'll just hear the corrections for the
[00:56.320 --> 01:03.760]  rest of the episodes in a future episode up front right but i think it was the episode that paul
[01:03.760 --> 01:09.600]  was on paul kafas a couple of weeks ago and we were talking about air pods too and um
[01:11.760 --> 01:15.840]  the fact that you know two years if you've been wearing your air pods regularly for two years
[01:15.840 --> 01:20.640]  your battery they're not for me they're not unusable it's just noticeably worse for amy
[01:20.640 --> 01:26.320]  it's a little worse hers hers because she uses them even more she really i mean yeah probably
[01:26.320 --> 01:33.920]  giving herself hearing damage um just how often but she always wear headphones a lot um uh well
[01:33.920 --> 01:38.720]  it's that or listen to you so yeah exactly yeah i don't honestly i wonder if she even is listening
[01:38.720 --> 01:46.960]  to anything karen wears hers i'll say she didn't get them until she didn't get them until september
[01:46.960 --> 01:52.320]  but they've hardly left her ears since then we but we mentioned that this kind of stinks that
[01:52.320 --> 01:59.040]  the problem with them isn't that they're broken it is that the little tiny batteries that power them
[01:59.040 --> 02:04.480]  wear out after two years it doesn't that feel like a shame you know that it for want of a battery
[02:04.480 --> 02:08.160]  you're throwing out a device and you know it really historically like back in the day when
[02:08.160 --> 02:13.360]  you and i were kids and you know through the 90s you know battery operated devices had batteries
[02:13.360 --> 02:18.320]  that came in and out and you know the idea that hey i'm gonna throw out my calculator because the
[02:18.320 --> 02:25.840]  battery's dead is yeah silly uh but that's you know where we are but it turns out there is this
[02:25.840 --> 02:32.640]  is my correction a few people wrote in with this i did not know but uh jonathan gulbrinson i believe
[02:32.640 --> 02:37.360]  was first so thanks to him but everybody who wrote a couple people wrote apple has a support page i
[02:37.360 --> 02:44.800]  will put it in in the notes but you can get air pod service and repair um yeah but it's kind of
[02:44.800 --> 02:51.920]  expensive well yeah right so uh battery service is forty nine dollars each but i believe it's
[02:51.920 --> 02:57.520]  and then it says out of warranty fee sixty nine dollars each and then lost is sixty nine dollars
[02:57.520 --> 03:03.600]  each uh charging case forty nine dollars for battery service out of warranty fee fifty nine
[03:03.600 --> 03:08.080]  i'm not sure if the out of warranty fee is for battery service or like out of warranty battery
[03:08.080 --> 03:15.680]  service or what but anyway the it is very close to the price of replacing them and the fact that
[03:15.680 --> 03:20.800]  the lost the one if you lose it or you get the battery replaced it's not that big a difference
[03:20.800 --> 03:25.360]  but it looks like you can get the batteries replaced for 49 each so that's 100 bucks so
[03:25.360 --> 03:30.960]  you would be saving you know a third of the price of a new set almost a third of the price of a new
[03:30.960 --> 03:35.920]  set of air pods right i wonder they i can't imagine they're actually replacing the batteries
[03:35.920 --> 03:40.400]  because didn't i fix it take those thing things apart and find that it's mostly glue in there
[03:40.400 --> 03:43.440]  yeah i thought so too it doesn't you know i figured they're just i figured they're just
[03:43.440 --> 03:49.200]  swapping out a pair yeah but are they actually but do they you know reuse the things i don't know i
[03:49.200 --> 03:53.200]  yeah seems a little you know again it's a little gross to think that they're no matter how well
[03:53.200 --> 03:58.560]  they clean it you know i mean like a refurbished phone you clean it you touch it that's fine uh
[03:58.560 --> 04:03.200]  yeah you know refurbished ear pods no i don't want yeah i don't i don't want it i don't care
[04:03.200 --> 04:07.520]  how thoroughly they cleaned it so i don't know but there it is you can do it
[04:09.440 --> 04:13.520]  it doesn't really you know and again i don't blame anyone i got the new ones too
[04:13.520 --> 04:19.280]  well actually i didn't buy them yet amy bought hers enjoys them i still have the review ones
[04:19.280 --> 04:24.560]  that apple sent me um i have to say i think some of the initial reaction this is one of the things
[04:24.560 --> 04:29.680]  i wanted to talk about some of the initial reaction to air pods to uh to me is getting
[04:30.480 --> 04:35.520]  apple all wrong there's i've seen a couple of youtube reviews that were sort of like this is
[04:35.520 --> 04:42.880]  it these look exactly the same and they at work exactly the same what how is this new and my
[04:42.880 --> 04:48.880]  reaction to that is uh well they didn't it's not like they got up on stage and had a big show about
[04:48.880 --> 04:54.560]  the new air pods they don't even call them air pod to you know they just place the old air pods with
[04:54.560 --> 04:59.920]  new air pods and in my experience so far they work a lot better and i thought the old ones work
[04:59.920 --> 05:06.640]  really well so like to me that's apple at its best yeah i mean the i'm not going to say but the hey
[05:06.640 --> 05:14.240]  dingus thing i think has actually made me start using serie a lot more and the latency overall
[05:14.240 --> 05:20.320]  of all of the things that had some degree of latency like when you first put them in your ear
[05:20.320 --> 05:26.480]  and you hear that that tone that says hey i got you you know i'm in your ear um it seems like
[05:26.480 --> 05:33.680]  that happens much sooner yes oh yeah yeah um yeah i used to have to i used to i had developed this
[05:33.680 --> 05:40.960]  tick where i would open the case and wait a three count hmm and then pull them out and put them in
[05:40.960 --> 05:45.120]  and i found that always that worked well like i because occasionally i would open the case
[05:45.120 --> 05:49.120]  put one in quickly put the second one in the second one would bong and the right one would
[05:49.120 --> 05:54.000]  not be you know the first one would not be connected right uh and so the way i worked
[05:54.000 --> 05:58.960]  around that was open the case one two three put the first one in and then the second one
[05:58.960 --> 06:04.480]  which is kind of dumb but it worked every time and now i'm trying to untrain myself from that
[06:05.280 --> 06:10.400]  which i'm having more difficulty than i expected because i don't need to do it anymore because
[06:10.400 --> 06:18.720]  they're they're fast yeah the hey dingus experience is exactly as promised just say it yeah and it
[06:18.720 --> 06:23.920]  happens and she answers yeah the first time i did it i was shocked yeah there's no tone there's no
[06:23.920 --> 06:28.560]  tone right it doesn't it doesn't you know it doesn't give you that tone that it does on the
[06:28.560 --> 06:38.400]  phone and i it just did what i wanted and i was like wow wow was that an accident did i miss
[06:38.400 --> 06:42.160]  something did is it is that the way it's supposed to work and that is the way it's supposed to work
[06:42.720 --> 06:49.040]  the only thing i still have i'm still very uncomfortable saying you know talking to it in
[06:49.040 --> 06:53.920]  public yeah me too so like i go out for a walk or a run or something like that and i always look
[06:53.920 --> 06:58.960]  around to make sure there's nobody around me before i tell it to do something right like so
[07:00.560 --> 07:06.640]  i i do like an idiot that i am i often do a lot of grocery shopping just like three items at a time
[07:06.640 --> 07:11.360]  you know because it occurs to me that i would i would like a ham sandwich and i will just go to
[07:12.080 --> 07:16.560]  a nice little market we have a few blocks away that's good italian bread and good lunch meat
[07:16.560 --> 07:21.760]  and pick up like two three things you know listening to podcasts and then i always take
[07:21.760 --> 07:25.840]  my air pods out i've said this before i think most people i think people should consider this
[07:25.840 --> 07:32.160]  i like to take them out or at least take one out at the register so that the you know don't just
[07:32.160 --> 07:38.160]  stop your your audio take it out to let them know hey i'm not listening i'm not so so inconsiderate
[07:38.160 --> 07:43.360]  that i'm listening to music or a podcast while i should be having a little retail exchange here
[07:44.480 --> 07:49.680]  but that means every time i leave the store i've got to put it back in and i often will want to
[07:49.680 --> 07:54.400]  give a direction to the dingus you know for what i want what i want to be listening to and that
[07:54.400 --> 08:01.360]  like store entrance is always busy and i i can't bring myself to do it like and every single time
[08:01.360 --> 08:08.960]  i think i should just get over this i really should but uh i i can't yeah i will and i wonder
[08:08.960 --> 08:14.000]  if that's a generational thing or if that's i don't know i don't i see tons of people wearing
[08:14.000 --> 08:20.560]  them you know more and more every day it is clearly one of not just a good product that i
[08:20.560 --> 08:24.640]  like but also a very successful product like it's gotten to the point amy we were we were out to
[08:24.640 --> 08:28.480]  dinner with friends last night and amy even said at one at this point sometimes she sees people
[08:28.480 --> 08:34.240]  with the wired ones and she's like what's wrong with you especially in winter like and that's the
[08:34.240 --> 08:38.400]  other thing too like we're it's april now the weather we've had a great month of weather here
[08:39.440 --> 08:44.160]  to put me in a good mood because of it um but having gone through winter now i realized that
[08:44.160 --> 08:48.960]  for years i really stopped listening or largely stopped listening to podcasts like while running
[08:48.960 --> 08:55.440]  errands in the winter because it was such a pain threading a cable you know where do you where do
[08:55.440 --> 08:59.520]  you put the thing how do you do it wearing a winter coat and listening to headphones was
[08:59.520 --> 09:06.240]  terrible uh now it's not a problem yeah but the latency thing is super super impressive to me
[09:06.240 --> 09:10.640]  it it just and again it wasn't like the old ones had bad latency they seemingly had the lowest
[09:10.640 --> 09:17.760]  latency of any wireless headphones i'd ever tried and i'd tried a few um but now it is almost it's
[09:17.760 --> 09:24.960]  gotten to the point where it's uncanny switching devices is also a lot more reliable like if you
[09:24.960 --> 09:29.280]  had them paired with your phone and now you want to switch to your ipad that doesn't seem to
[09:29.280 --> 09:34.080]  sometimes that would just spin and spin and spin and it was like you had to had to do it over
[09:34.080 --> 09:39.360]  again right right the only problem i can still have problems the only device i still have
[09:39.360 --> 09:45.120]  problems with is the mac uh i find that i it'll work if i've recently logged out of an account
[09:45.120 --> 09:51.120]  log out of the account and back in again or rebooted and then i'm not sure what there's
[09:51.120 --> 09:56.240]  probably some audio thing that i'm doing that it doesn't like and then it it won't see the
[09:56.240 --> 10:02.000]  airpods again after that whatever it is maybe it's podcasting there's a
[10:05.280 --> 10:12.240]  a couple of utilities um so there's michael sai has one what's his air buddy
[10:13.760 --> 10:18.640]  oh yeah i did hear about that i'm not sure if that fixes that problem no air buddy is the one from
[10:18.640 --> 10:25.440]  speaking speaking of him garum rambo um i forget what michael says it's like i've got it up here
[10:25.440 --> 10:33.440]  in my menu bar i forget the name of it here oh tooth fairy so i guess i gotta start putting
[10:33.440 --> 10:38.240]  these things in the show notes so tooth fairy is a menu bar utility from michael sai that
[10:40.640 --> 10:44.800]  i think it makes it better switching it to your mac but i don't think it's great i think air buddy
[10:44.800 --> 10:53.840]  from garum rambo is much it's much better um have you ever tried it no i have not so when i first
[10:53.840 --> 10:58.560]  read the description i didn't think it was going to solve my particular problem but maybe i was
[10:58.560 --> 11:04.400]  mistaken so air buddy works makes it work it really i hate to say it i mean but it really
[11:04.400 --> 11:08.720]  works the way i think apple should have made it work on the mac where you just open the case near
[11:08.720 --> 11:15.680]  your mac and it shows up in a nice little animated window like the little slidey panel on ios and
[11:15.680 --> 11:20.800]  shows you the air pods and it has a nice animation and then there's a little button that says connect
[11:20.800 --> 11:25.440]  and then you can connect and then they connect and then that makes me wonder how come on ios
[11:25.440 --> 11:30.240]  they don't have a connect button that's that's like by now my biggest complaint with the air
[11:30.240 --> 11:35.520]  pods is like let's say i have it paired with my phone and i want to switch to my ipad why can't
[11:35.520 --> 11:40.080]  i just open the case near the ipad and hit a connect button why do i have to go to settings
[11:40.080 --> 11:46.960]  and bluetooth and stuff like that yeah it's it it seems like it could be like the technology
[11:46.960 --> 11:50.560]  is all there they just need the interface to make it easier to switch between devices
[11:52.880 --> 11:58.800]  and shouldn't i maybe be able to tell my my say siri dingus shouldn't i just be able to say hey
[11:58.800 --> 12:08.960]  dingus uh switch yeah air pods to the to my ipad right and if i've only got one ipad then it should
[12:08.960 --> 12:16.560]  do it that would be really cool it seems like something that they could do yeah this says he's
[12:16.560 --> 12:23.280]  apparently has not updated everybody yet for air pods too so it doesn't work with their pods too
[12:23.280 --> 12:27.600]  well i think he did snit that he's not saying that but he just doesn't hasn't tested it out yet
[12:27.600 --> 12:33.120]  yeah and there is a preference in the in the window it says enable for other w1 headsets
[12:34.640 --> 12:41.360]  and air pods are not a w1 headset anymore they're the the h1 so maybe he's doing something at such
[12:41.360 --> 12:47.920]  a low level because he's so devilishly clever that it doesn't work i actually haven't haven't
[12:47.920 --> 12:52.960]  noticed i don't really use my air pods with my mac very often so that's one reason why i i'm
[12:52.960 --> 12:58.240]  you know so i don't know i don't i don't i guess i haven't even tried it it's definitely the device
[12:58.240 --> 13:04.000]  i use it with the least so that's why i still enjoy the experience so much but it does every
[13:04.000 --> 13:10.960]  once in a while i do want to use it and it then it often stumbles yeah uh i use it for of course
[13:10.960 --> 13:17.440]  for watching baseball games on the ipad uh your seattle mariners wow what an opening to the season
[13:17.440 --> 13:24.240]  they had you don't care it's pretty good i do no i care but i i've been hurt too many times so so
[13:24.240 --> 13:29.520]  they open the season with 20 straight games where they hit a home run in every game which is uh i
[13:29.520 --> 13:33.520]  think broke the major league record you would think the yankees would have that record but
[13:33.520 --> 13:40.720]  now the mariners do yeah i have a lot of stupid ideas about sports teams that are that are based
[13:40.720 --> 13:48.800]  on just the the branding and attitude of the teams from when i was a child like like i feel
[13:48.800 --> 13:54.320]  that the miami dolphins should always be a team that has a good passing game but that's just
[13:54.320 --> 13:59.280]  because i had dan marino when i was a kid and but that's just what i think right right uh the dallas
[13:59.280 --> 14:04.480]  cowboys should always have a superstar running back that's just i just feel like that's the way
[14:04.480 --> 14:11.120]  it should be the seattle mariners to me should always be a team full of like 300 pound sluggers
[14:11.120 --> 14:18.000]  who can hit the ball 500 feet like they may or may not be good they're probably not going to win the
[14:18.000 --> 14:22.240]  world series but they are going to they're going to have they are going to hit the hell out of the
[14:22.240 --> 14:27.360]  baseball that's just to me that mariners should always be a very hard slugging baseball team
[14:27.360 --> 14:32.400]  yeah well and they have a park for it too right so all right i do whatever the hell it's called
[14:32.400 --> 14:39.440]  this year t-mobile park yeah god that's the worst that role is trippingly off the tongue
[14:40.240 --> 14:44.240]  oh my god did you i mean i wasn't i wasn't a huge fan of safeco field to begin with either
[14:44.240 --> 14:47.840]  but we got used to that and now i gotta get used to something else see that's the thing about
[14:47.840 --> 14:52.240]  super annoying that's the thing about selling these naming rights is yeah it's bad enough
[14:52.240 --> 14:59.360]  you know when it just goes to some crappy bank uh but they switch it around and then you forget what
[14:59.360 --> 15:06.000]  they're called like our uh i don't i i think it's the wells fargo center now yeah that's our
[15:06.000 --> 15:14.560]  philadelphia's uh like hockey and basketball arena but it's changed names at least three or four
[15:14.560 --> 15:20.880]  times since it opened and it's often not because it's like because these banks merge and then the
[15:20.880 --> 15:27.200]  bank who had the naming rights doesn't even exist anymore so they have to change it because they
[15:27.200 --> 15:32.400]  spill their money on advertising right it was i and i kid you not i think it was i forget what
[15:32.400 --> 15:40.000]  it opened as uh i forget the name of the bank when it first opened but then they got bought
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.720]  by a bank called first union and it was already called the whatever center and i guess they wanted
[15:44.720 --> 15:49.680]  to keep the center name so i swear for at least five or six years it was the first union center
[15:49.680 --> 15:57.280]  fuc like who would do who thinks that's a good name that's crazy can't have a curse word for
[15:57.280 --> 16:04.480]  the initials they tried they kept trying to call it like the announcers would kept trying to call
[16:04.480 --> 16:11.840]  it the safe like no that did not that did not catch on uh and now it's you know and fine because
[16:11.840 --> 16:15.360]  it's now something else but then you have to use that now i guess they have to use the like the
[16:15.360 --> 16:18.560]  i haven't been up there since they changed the name but they have to use the t-mobile colors i
[16:18.560 --> 16:26.800]  guess which is pink oh which is you know it doesn't really go well with the it doesn't go
[16:26.800 --> 16:33.120]  well with anything particularly in baseball but oh man you know what they call uh kaminsky park
[16:33.120 --> 16:38.400]  now where the white socks play it's it is called guaranteed rate field oh yeah that's
[16:38.400 --> 16:42.880]  i swear to god that's the name of the stadium guaranteed rate field
[16:42.880 --> 16:50.640]  i got that's just one of those things where like you're like a white socks executive you've got to
[16:50.640 --> 16:58.240]  sell the rates the guaranteed rate is on line one and they give you the number you know and it's a
[16:58.240 --> 17:02.000]  good number it's the biggest number you got and you just sit there at a table and you're looking
[17:02.000 --> 17:08.160]  at guarantee you're looking at drawings of the sign guaranteed rate field you're imagining the
[17:08.160 --> 17:14.400]  announcers welcoming you to guaranteed rate field 81 times a year the one thing that we have that
[17:14.400 --> 17:19.520]  is that i absolutely adore and get just like a ridiculous thrill out of every single time i
[17:19.520 --> 17:25.920]  go by uh formerly safeco field is uh there's a name renamed a street agar martinez drive
[17:26.640 --> 17:33.920]  that's good and i that is um i think that's delightful yeah and then see and that should
[17:33.920 --> 17:38.320]  always you know or at least for a long long time will be agar martinez drive he did not
[17:38.320 --> 17:46.240]  pay for those rights guaranteed guaranteed rate avenue until until guaranteed rate buys it up
[17:46.240 --> 17:51.360]  right and then it's just in small parentheses yeah it's just start selling off the names to
[17:51.360 --> 18:01.200]  everything and then every street will change every 10 years yeah um that won't be confusing
[18:01.200 --> 18:05.600]  no not at all uh so anyway i'm glad you have the new air pods i'm glad you like them i'm glad i'm
[18:05.600 --> 18:10.480]  not alone and notice i like i tried talking to amy about the latency and she i get she just put
[18:10.480 --> 18:18.800]  them in her ears yeah she's like whatever right right shut up nerd do you did you get the wireless
[18:18.800 --> 18:25.280]  charging pad version i did not because i'm still i still do not have a wirelessly charging phone
[18:25.280 --> 18:33.600]  so i'm still using an se uh and um i thought well i'll i'll kick that can down the road and see
[18:34.640 --> 18:38.400]  see what happens because i'm not going to run out and buy a wireless charging pad just for
[18:38.400 --> 18:43.680]  like my my earphones amy asked me what to buy and i told her to get the wireless one just because
[18:43.680 --> 18:51.360]  it seemed to me like for 30 bucks why not just get it right even though she doesn't have she
[18:51.360 --> 18:56.480]  has a phone that could use a wireless charging pad but doesn't have one set up anywhere like i've got
[18:56.480 --> 19:02.480]  one bedside but she doesn't want one she's just got like cables uh really yeah i got i got karen
[19:02.480 --> 19:07.200]  a wireless charging pen she absolutely loves it i she probably would like it so i probably should
[19:07.200 --> 19:14.080]  just buy her one yeah i'm just cheap now too yeah they really are um well but now it's like that was
[19:14.640 --> 19:18.400]  part of the thing with air power the dream was that you would know which one to buy
[19:18.400 --> 19:23.920]  right although it probably wasn't going to be cheap and so it was certainly not going to be cheap
[19:24.720 --> 19:33.280]  uh but at least particularly when it burned your house down the idea of it though it it was so
[19:33.280 --> 19:37.680]  appealing and in hindsight now that they've officially cancelled it and it's no longer
[19:37.680 --> 19:46.720]  like it years for you for five years it was it was a dream i don't know it seems like it was a
[19:46.720 --> 19:53.760]  long time ago but in hindsight though especially now that i have this uh it not just the watch like
[19:53.760 --> 19:58.560]  i had the watch and you know obviously it has to charge inductively uh because it only charges that
[19:58.560 --> 20:04.640]  way and i had a i have my watch charger over on a dresser apart from my bed and then i've got a
[20:04.640 --> 20:11.200]  thing there for my phone right next to my bed uh and now that i've got this third thing that can
[20:11.200 --> 20:16.800]  charge that way it seems like it would be so perfect to just have one thing yeah right there
[20:16.800 --> 20:21.840]  next to my bed and i could put all three of them on it and that would be great i i long story short
[20:21.840 --> 20:27.120]  i just don't i haven't other than to try it and see if it works i don't really charge it wirelessly
[20:27.120 --> 20:32.320]  i just do what i did with the old ones and if it seems like it's low put it on the lightning and
[20:32.320 --> 20:38.080]  it charges so fast that by the time i want to listen to something even if it's 10 minutes later
[20:38.080 --> 20:45.840]  it's good to go right yeah she was she the one i gave her is the one that like an anchor that
[20:45.840 --> 20:54.240]  stands up and and so she has it next to her desk and that is for her it's awesome because
[20:54.240 --> 20:59.840]  she's working she can just tap on it it'll open up i looking at her face and then she can do whatever
[20:59.840 --> 21:03.600]  she wants to do right i have that one on my desk too or maybe i don't know if it's the same one but
[21:03.600 --> 21:10.560]  i have an anchor stand up one on my desk and i actually like it better than a lay down pad
[21:11.520 --> 21:16.400]  yeah and and not just in terms of like the ergonomics of hey it can actually see your
[21:16.400 --> 21:21.600]  face and you can use it and you could look at the screen and poke at it but it i never misplace it
[21:21.600 --> 21:28.400]  on the mat whereas the one i have bedside the old uh it's still every once in a while wake up in the
[21:28.400 --> 21:34.080]  morning and i'm you know got no charge because i uh screwed it up didn't put it on the pad correctly
[21:34.080 --> 21:40.400]  right because that was also part of the dream of air power was a non-finicky uh
[21:41.600 --> 21:44.240]  yeah non-finicky place yeah any of the devices anywhere
[21:48.960 --> 21:52.960]  but all right laying those coils on top of each other doesn't work so well
[21:52.960 --> 21:59.040]  well i just posted right before we started you probably didn't read it because i posted like
[21:59.040 --> 22:05.040]  this is why i postponed our show is i posted a piece on the the galaxy fold and yeah and i
[22:05.040 --> 22:08.480]  mentioned the air power you know to compare and contrast the companies we'll get to that
[22:09.040 --> 22:14.640]  okay but uh i actually posted i used the headline i want to know what you think
[22:14.640 --> 22:18.720]  i should have checked with you beforehand i actually i used the headline this is my headline
[22:18.720 --> 22:25.440]  know when to fold them yeah was it worth it for the pun or is that awful yeah why not all right
[22:25.440 --> 22:29.680]  i might be you're not the first to make that fun also i'll say that but it's a it's it's a
[22:29.680 --> 22:34.880]  it's a solid pun it's so obvious though right that's the problem i might be asking the wrong
[22:34.880 --> 22:42.640]  person all right let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor new sponsor very excited

[24:47.520 --> 24:53.760]  what else have i missed well well did you get yourself a galaxy phone no i did not i'm
[24:53.760 --> 24:59.440]  surprisingly not on the uh on the list of reviewers for the for galaxy devices i could
[24:59.440 --> 25:04.400]  probably get it you know you probably could yeah yeah i'm sure i could not now but no no not now
[25:05.600 --> 25:13.680]  uh friend of the show and and and oft times guest just joanna stern wrote a a non-review
[25:13.680 --> 25:20.560]  of the galaxy fold just more or less excoriating samsung for having given reviewers something that
[25:20.560 --> 25:28.640]  was so clearly uh unfinished product uh just absolutely scathing uh it's hard to overstate
[25:28.640 --> 25:33.440]  like i i at some level i'd like what i tried to write about today is at some level the whole thing
[25:33.440 --> 25:38.000]  feels like a joke like haha samsung you know they tried to sell a two thousand dollar phone
[25:38.000 --> 25:44.000]  that folds and when you fold it it breaks after a day or two uh at some level it is kind of funny
[25:44.000 --> 25:49.600]  but there is something something profoundly wrong happened with that device or if we're in the
[25:49.600 --> 25:59.120]  company with that device like how did that get out the door yeah well it seemed like they thought
[25:59.120 --> 26:06.160]  that they needed to ship one and somebody else's was it lg no it's a huawei i think huawei which
[26:06.160 --> 26:14.000]  i think makes it worse because it's the up-and-comer right huawei is sort of the one of the you know
[26:14.000 --> 26:18.480]  it may be one of the companies that really is putting samsung in a bad place in china you know
[26:18.480 --> 26:22.800]  well not maybe there's no maybe about it let me take that back definitely yeah right and so
[26:22.800 --> 26:27.760]  they're they're shipping one that means we have to have one too right we have to be first yeah
[26:28.960 --> 26:34.480]  you know and i guess i understand the goal of wanting to be first and i totally get like i've
[26:34.480 --> 26:41.120]  been opposed to this device ever since they showed it just based on the just the physical
[26:41.120 --> 26:48.080]  aspects of it the fact that it's roughly two regular phones thick when folded uh and doesn't
[26:48.080 --> 26:52.560]  even fold when you do fold it if you look at it sideways you know like looking at the spine of a
[26:52.560 --> 26:58.400]  book it it does it the the two halves don't even meet neatly they're sort of in a wedge shape it's
[26:58.400 --> 27:06.880]  it's so the folding part of it is so ungainly um i it there's a part of me that really is annoyed
[27:06.880 --> 27:16.480]  that that samsung the company that spent an awful lot of time making fun of notches in phones put
[27:17.120 --> 27:28.000]  an incredibly ugly notch on this phone yeah asymmetric off in the corner i don't know
[27:28.000 --> 27:38.720]  uh it it's a bad design but i'll just concede though that i like apple style products i mean
[27:38.720 --> 27:44.080]  this is not that might seem like a statement of the obvious given what i do what i write about
[27:44.080 --> 27:52.960]  what i talk about but there is an apple aesthetic and there always has been and it's not even like
[27:52.960 --> 28:02.560]  it's the same aesthetic right like the the uh the 1984 mac style didn't look like a 1998
[28:04.640 --> 28:11.280]  original imac right totally different in every way you know use of curves use of rectangles the
[28:11.280 --> 28:18.800]  plastics all this aluminum and glass stuff they've had for the last 10 to 15 years different but it
[28:18.800 --> 28:23.440]  i just mean though that it's a company that at a very deep cultural level wants to ship beautiful
[28:23.440 --> 28:29.840]  objects right you know and and there's that oft oft oft quoted steve jobs line that design
[28:29.840 --> 28:34.240]  so most people think design is what it looks like it's not design is how it works
[28:37.280 --> 28:44.640]  but even that said that true design is how it works or the hard part of design is how it works
[28:44.640 --> 28:51.440]  let's face it apple and steve jobs like to ship objects that look look good right there's it's
[28:51.440 --> 28:57.360]  it what he really should have said is it's not just what it looks like it's also how it works
[28:57.360 --> 29:02.240]  but you know he's steve he was steve jobs so of course he wasn't going to wasn't going to put like
[29:02.240 --> 29:11.680]  a caveat yeah no caveats from steve jobs um there's a reason why i'm not as oft quoted as
[29:11.680 --> 29:21.280]  steve jobs that's all the caveats that should be my middle name my new nickname caveat that would
[29:21.280 --> 29:29.200]  be a cool nickname caveat uh but you know what i mean like you just i i don't know if i'm going
[29:29.200 --> 29:35.440]  to carry a phone around all day i want it to be a device that i think looks good you know i care
[29:35.440 --> 29:40.640]  about stuff like that although i don't think this i mean i think anybody who reasonably looked at
[29:40.640 --> 29:47.200]  this phone would not come away with the conclusion that you're going to use this as your daily phone
[29:47.200 --> 29:53.680]  i mean i just don't it seemed like it was a prototype that was shipped to satisfy just to
[29:53.680 --> 30:00.240]  say first right yeah like a comment yeah like a comment right right yeah and and they and they
[30:00.240 --> 30:07.120]  have a history of shipping wacky features that aren't well developed right in order to do them
[30:07.120 --> 30:14.160]  and say that they've done it and this is another possibly more high profile instance of that
[30:14.720 --> 30:20.320]  yeah so what i'm trying to get to is that maybe subject subjectively i think it's an ugly device
[30:20.320 --> 30:26.000]  that never should have shipped anywhere close to looking like this personally but i will admit that
[30:26.000 --> 30:32.800]  maybe for samsung that that's fine that's fine for samsung and that there are other people with
[30:32.800 --> 30:38.960]  consumers with tastes very different than mine who are so taken by the novelty of this and maybe
[30:40.080 --> 30:46.320]  and let's say in theory it is very useful idea it's an interesting idea to have
[30:46.960 --> 30:55.120]  a big screen that can be folded into a smaller screen for pocketability you know it in theory
[30:55.120 --> 31:01.360]  the basic idea of devices that that can be smaller and stretched or folded or whatever
[31:01.360 --> 31:08.000]  else from science fiction rolled up you know you know there's a reason that all the oft-cited
[31:08.000 --> 31:13.840]  science fiction sources with foldable tablet type things are they always look cool right the west
[31:13.840 --> 31:19.040]  world tablets look super cool yeah and it seems like it would be super useful so i can totally
[31:19.040 --> 31:26.800]  see how somebody would be it maybe i'm you know maybe my opinion that it looks ugly doesn't matter
[31:26.800 --> 31:31.760]  and if they could have made it work as exactly as promised this would have been fine for samsung
[31:31.760 --> 31:40.160]  even at two thousand dollars maybe um but let's put that aside what it actually is is a device
[31:40.160 --> 31:46.640]  that clearly doesn't work like it is almost mind-boggling that it you know it wasn't just
[31:46.640 --> 31:53.600]  one reviewer it seemed like most of them it it broke after a day or two like completely broke
[31:53.600 --> 32:00.080]  yeah like how not just and not just the ones who peeled off the the plastic covering that looked
[32:00.080 --> 32:05.840]  like a screen protector that was actually supposed to be part of the screen i forget whose youtube
[32:05.840 --> 32:13.600]  video did it and i i don't know i maybe it was mkphd uh but he actually was pointing out that
[32:14.240 --> 32:18.800]  not only does it look like something you're supposed to peel samsung itself ships its other
[32:18.800 --> 32:24.400]  flagship phones with a thing that looks like this that you peel and then he cut to like his review
[32:24.400 --> 32:29.280]  of like the last thing where he you know was unboxing it and peeling off the thing
[32:33.440 --> 32:38.560]  yeah that's just when you when they decided they needed to put that screen on it it really seems
[32:38.560 --> 32:42.720]  like maybe that was part you know part of the process there where that should have gone up
[32:42.720 --> 32:50.720]  the chain of hey we might not be ready this might not be ready this now might be a good idea it it
[32:51.360 --> 32:58.000]  there must have been people engineers and quality control there must have been people inside samsung
[32:58.000 --> 33:03.600]  who knew that this was going to happen that these things weren't going to work and yet the company
[33:03.600 --> 33:11.840]  was full steam ahead giving out review units uh they had press events that they canceled yesterday
[33:11.840 --> 33:16.000]  because they were i guess in korea where they were going to have you know briefings and they
[33:16.000 --> 33:22.240]  would until yesterday they were planning to start selling these things friday this friday
[33:23.920 --> 33:29.440]  i i mean i don't know what the actual failure rate is like let's say if they sent a thousand
[33:29.440 --> 33:33.040]  the first thousand of them that they made and they put them into people's hands how many of
[33:33.040 --> 33:38.640]  them were going to fail maybe the reviewers just it was just bad luck that so many of them failed
[33:38.640 --> 33:42.480]  but clearly though you're like if you have enough of them that fail after a day
[33:44.720 --> 33:49.120]  i mean you know some of some phones you can't test like you can't test something that for a
[33:49.120 --> 33:54.800]  year right you can't test it right necessarily for that amount of time before deciding whether
[33:54.800 --> 33:57.840]  or not you can ship it so you don't know if there's some sort of defect that's going to crop
[33:57.840 --> 34:06.480]  up in a year after regular use but you can definitely test it for 24 to 48 hours right
[34:06.480 --> 34:11.760]  like how could they not how could they not have been using it themselves in some number of them
[34:11.760 --> 34:16.400]  inside the company even if it doesn't leave you know like you don't leave campus with it you come
[34:16.400 --> 34:22.400]  in in the day but you your your phone once you get to work is is a you know a pre-production
[34:22.960 --> 34:29.760]  galaxy fold how it had to have somebody had to have known and there is i i really do mean this
[34:29.760 --> 34:36.560]  i don't think there's any other way around it like in theory it could have been a bad batch
[34:36.560 --> 34:40.560]  that was sent out to reviewers but if that were the case and Samsung were confident that it was
[34:40.560 --> 34:46.240]  just a fluke that you know this batch you know that we sent over they like all these reviewers
[34:46.240 --> 34:50.800]  got them from the same batch if they looked at the numbers and thought hey that batch was bad
[34:51.520 --> 34:56.880]  they would have sent the reviewers ones from a different production batch if they you know i
[34:56.880 --> 35:01.440]  mean it happens that you get a review unit that doesn't work for other you know even with apple
[35:01.440 --> 35:06.800]  products you know yeah there was a there was an early problem with the watch right i yeah i had
[35:06.800 --> 35:12.720]  tactic it was a taptic engine yeah i had a i had a watch review unit that the taptic engine failed
[35:12.720 --> 35:21.200]  after a day yeah and apple provided me you know the same day um uh with a replacement and the
[35:21.200 --> 35:26.960]  replacement didn't fail and yeah you know i mentioned it in my review they had they were
[35:26.960 --> 35:30.080]  having problems with one supplier and they cut that supplier and that was one of the reasons
[35:30.080 --> 35:34.960]  why yeah it was harder harder to get a watch early on yeah and i you know and they were very
[35:34.960 --> 35:38.960]  very keen uh i mean number one they were embarrassed you know and they knew i was gonna
[35:38.960 --> 35:43.600]  mention it you know it's you know that they're every any company would be you know you don't
[35:43.600 --> 35:50.400]  want a reviewer to get a thing that fails um but you know they didn't try to sandbag it at all but
[35:50.400 --> 35:57.840]  they were all very very keen i think they were just as keen to get me a replacement asap as they
[35:57.840 --> 36:04.720]  were to get their hands on my one that failed asap yeah uh like i don't know what the fastest
[36:05.280 --> 36:11.120]  way of getting a broken watch from philadelphia back to cupertino is but that watch took it
[36:13.280 --> 36:19.600]  like i that express yeah that that thing was a guy with a briefcase and that's chained to
[36:19.600 --> 36:24.800]  his wrist yeah that's a perfect example though because there's one that me personally experienced
[36:24.800 --> 36:29.840]  where i had the first generation apple watch my review unit the taptic engine literally broke
[36:29.840 --> 36:37.440]  after a day and it was sort of it faded away right like it was like at first it didn't seem
[36:37.440 --> 36:42.240]  right it just seemed like hmm i could have sworn when i had the hands-on time that those the taps
[36:42.240 --> 36:47.280]  were better than this and then it seemed to get worse and then it was like this is definitely
[36:47.280 --> 36:52.720]  getting worse and that's i got in contact with them before it actually broke and i was like i
[36:52.720 --> 36:58.640]  i'm i'm i really don't think i'm nuts i i think that the taptic engine is failing on this unit
[36:59.440 --> 37:03.440]  and then they were like well we'll send a guy down from new york you know you know will you
[37:03.440 --> 37:07.680]  be home in an hour and i was like i don't think you can get here in an hour damn if they didn't
[37:07.680 --> 37:11.360]  get here in an hour somehow it's like a 90-minute train ride
[37:11.360 --> 37:17.760]  helicopter yeah but in between then in between saying like i really think i need a different
[37:17.760 --> 37:24.960]  unit and when they got here it was completely dead and and uh yeah that happens i don't this
[37:24.960 --> 37:30.560]  is obviously not that type of situation you know it it this is a device that clearly never
[37:30.560 --> 37:35.520]  never should have been launched i thought it was i said it and i think that it seems so
[37:35.520 --> 37:43.200]  the human we're not meant to deal with extraordinary exceptions right a perfect
[37:43.200 --> 37:50.320]  here per first hand uh a week ago when the news broke that uh notre dame cathedral was on fire
[37:50.320 --> 37:58.800]  and my catastrophic fire i i thought well that can't happen right no yeah i mean that's why we
[37:58.800 --> 38:05.520]  all that it's why tv it tv is such an extraordinary thing because then you turn on the tv and you see
[38:05.520 --> 38:09.600]  that it is and it really helps whereas if i had only heard that i would have thought well that it
[38:09.600 --> 38:12.960]  couldn't be that bad it's probably like a little little little fire in the corner of the attic or
[38:12.960 --> 38:18.000]  something you know you you doesn't have an attic it did no it did have an attic and that's actually
[38:18.000 --> 38:22.960]  where the fire started or i guess no not anymore it's actually where the fire started i guess no
[38:22.960 --> 38:28.960]  not anymore it no longer has an attic and i believe that there when they rebuild it it'll have a
[38:28.960 --> 38:34.320]  different paddock uh i approve that i don't want to go off we have too many other things to talk
[38:34.320 --> 38:40.080]  about but i i did read some stuff there and there was a bit of wishful thinking as opposed to
[38:42.800 --> 38:47.680]  and apparently that's not wasn't unique that there's a lot of old cathedrals that are fire
[38:47.680 --> 38:52.560]  traps but there's a lot of old cathedrals that are fire traps and there's a lot of old cathedrals
[38:52.560 --> 39:00.560]  uh just because they you know it's very old it was what yeah 800 years old uh you know the fire
[39:00.560 --> 39:06.640]  standards weren't quite up to snuff then and they were the church was long resistant to putting in
[39:06.640 --> 39:10.640]  they had smoke detectors but they were long resistant to putting in like sprinklers and
[39:10.640 --> 39:14.800]  electrical stuff up there because they thought maybe just putting the stream the electronic
[39:14.800 --> 39:23.600]  the the wiring might might cause the fire um no but there was some guy so many of the experts in
[39:23.600 --> 39:29.520]  news articles speak in such mealy ways and then there's somebody i like it when they get somebody
[39:29.520 --> 39:34.000]  who just says it and they got some guy who was like an expert on fire safety and he just said
[39:34.000 --> 39:38.960]  flat out if it wasn't a cathedral it would have been condemned you know decades ago
[39:38.960 --> 39:46.400]  decades ago condemned should tear it down right if it was any other type of building
[39:46.400 --> 39:53.440]  it would have been condemned uh yeah anyway uh but i think then when then when those reviews broke
[39:53.440 --> 39:57.680]  last week when it wasn't even reviews of people it was so early on in the process that it was
[39:57.680 --> 40:04.000]  tweets because nobody you know everybody had only had it for a day or two and and german's broke and
[40:04.000 --> 40:09.760]  german's the one who at least was the first i saw who kind of explained the whole screen protector
[40:09.760 --> 40:15.840]  thing he showed that picture i loved it in the picture he showed he's like this is the thing
[40:15.840 --> 40:20.640]  they said i wasn't supposed to take off it just looked like a piece of garbage it didn't look
[40:20.640 --> 40:25.520]  like he took off a piece of a phone it looked like like a like a wrapper from a sandwich
[40:25.520 --> 40:33.280]  did you see it it was that's a good question is the galaxy full of the sandwich
[40:36.080 --> 40:40.240]  because it folds more like a hot dog well joanna star and put a hot dog in it
[40:40.240 --> 40:47.120]  in her video she put a hot dog in it why not i guess you know yeah you might as well use it
[40:47.120 --> 40:53.520]  for something yeah no i think that some people saw those tweets and it was obviously the you know the
[40:53.520 --> 40:57.520]  the little hubbub of the day because it seemed extraordinary you know any one of them it would
[40:57.520 --> 41:03.040]  have been interesting like hey here's a guy who got a a bum review unit of this foldable phone but
[41:03.040 --> 41:10.080]  it was a bunch of them i i wrote and i i wasn't being hyperbolic i was like this thing is not
[41:10.080 --> 41:16.800]  going to ship and i think that some people took that as me sort of exaggerating like i said being
[41:16.800 --> 41:22.240]  hyperbolic but i meant it i just think it was it's so hard to fathom that a company of samsung size
[41:22.240 --> 41:28.720]  and it would would ship a high profile device that never should have shipped yeah but it seemed very
[41:28.720 --> 41:36.240]  clear at that point that that's exactly what had happened yeah i don't know i mean it it seems like
[41:36.240 --> 41:41.520]  this technology will be there someday but it's i guess we'll see what the what the wah we want is
[41:41.520 --> 41:47.440]  like but and it seemed that one seemed a little bit better looking it definitely seemed better
[41:47.440 --> 41:55.920]  looking i in theory i like the idea of one that folds outwards so that there's part of what i
[41:55.920 --> 42:00.800]  find distasteful about the greatly distasteful about the design of the galaxy fold is that
[42:00.800 --> 42:07.520]  there's the main screen inside that you open it up and you've got this sort of squarish screen
[42:07.520 --> 42:12.880]  but then when you fold it because it folds inside there's an another screen on the outside there's a
[42:12.880 --> 42:19.520]  crappier smaller screen right crappier screen bad specs yeah it huge huge bezels like the biggest
[42:19.520 --> 42:26.320]  bezels on any phone in the iphone era um because it's obviously it's meant to be secondary
[42:28.080 --> 42:32.880]  i i just find it distasteful yeah it's just you know whereas only having one screen
[42:34.080 --> 42:40.480]  and when folded its phone size and when unfolded its tablet size seems better but on the other hand
[42:40.480 --> 42:50.240]  design wise it seems very uh uh dangerous to have the screen on the outside of both sides and
[42:51.440 --> 42:57.120]  therefore you can't put it in a case i'm not really a case person i i've i've started taking
[42:57.120 --> 43:02.400]  cases with me when i travel and we go on vacation and i when i'm using my phone more as a camera
[43:02.400 --> 43:08.160]  than a phone because it's like our i actually really enjoy having a case that gives it a bit
[43:08.160 --> 43:13.840]  more grip um yeah yeah it seems like often when you're holding it in the camera style you're
[43:13.840 --> 43:18.560]  holding it on the edges with your fingertips and yeah and then you have to push the screen or or i
[43:18.560 --> 43:22.800]  mean you can hit the button but you can you usually push the screen in order and i'm always afraid i'm
[43:22.800 --> 43:28.240]  gonna pop it out of my hand yeah i i like that i like it using a case for that but it you know
[43:28.240 --> 43:31.120]  without going on a whole tangent about why everybody puts their phones and screens
[43:31.760 --> 43:36.080]  everybody puts their phones and screens effectively you know for some reasonable value
[43:36.080 --> 43:40.400]  of something close to everybody everybody puts their phones whether they're android
[43:40.400 --> 43:45.920]  phones or iphones they put them in cases so i don't see how that that huawei design
[43:46.880 --> 43:52.800]  is i get the novelty of it and why people would look at it and if it works if it actually works
[43:52.800 --> 43:57.840]  and doesn't break people would say wow that's cool but i feel like at a fundamental level i
[43:57.840 --> 44:02.960]  don't know that that'll ever be popular so i kind of get why samsung put the fold inside yeah and
[44:02.960 --> 44:07.040]  you can't i mean you really can't put that phone the huawei one in a case at all right because
[44:07.040 --> 44:10.320]  there's like i don't see how i don't see how you covering up the screen and then when you go to
[44:10.320 --> 44:14.400]  unfold it to use the the feature with that you paid two thousand dollars for you'd have to
[44:14.400 --> 44:19.680]  fumble with some sort of cover to get it off right you could use it yeah and however bad the crease
[44:19.680 --> 44:25.920]  is uh however noticeable the crease is when it's open if you have like a clear case over the
[44:25.920 --> 44:30.240]  the one half of it that like you're not gonna be able to touch on that side
[44:30.240 --> 44:35.280]  and i mean it you can't use it with a case so i don't see how i'm not sure how practical that
[44:35.280 --> 44:40.800]  is in the real world the whole thing just but even both even admitting that the huawei one
[44:40.800 --> 44:45.680]  does look better it doesn't seem practical and doesn't seem like something real people
[44:45.680 --> 44:51.600]  would actually buy in large numbers it all just seems like hey we've got these screens that can
[44:51.600 --> 44:57.360]  fold right in a cool way here's the like let's use them let's really let's make a phone that
[44:57.360 --> 45:01.760]  let's make a phone that you can fold let's make a screen you can fold in half yeah again sounds
[45:01.760 --> 45:10.400]  cool but i i doesn't make for a good product i i think the answer is probably not yeah but i still
[45:10.400 --> 45:16.240]  think the meta the meta story of how in the world in what is what was the story like inside samsung
[45:16.800 --> 45:24.560]  where this either wasn't noticed at any level which seems impossible i i mean but if that's
[45:24.560 --> 45:28.880]  the case that's dreadful that they nobody used they built this and nobody used it
[45:29.600 --> 45:39.120]  or i think more likely that there was serious concerns raised if not if not
[45:39.120 --> 45:46.720]  outright protestations that hey this shouldn't be built or shipped from engineering and quality
[45:46.720 --> 45:53.280]  control and maybe at the production level like maybe their pre-production prototypes didn't fail
[45:53.280 --> 45:58.800]  this way but then once they went into actual production the ones coming off the line obviously
[45:58.800 --> 46:05.280]  didn't like i'm pretty sure that's what happened with air power by the way do you remember the
[46:05.280 --> 46:09.280]  stories there were a couple of stories in january that the air power had entered production
[46:10.880 --> 46:13.840]  and then we all thought hey we're going to get these things right that they've entered
[46:13.840 --> 46:18.800]  production i don't have any sources who confirm this i i've heard talked to several people who
[46:18.800 --> 46:27.040]  worked on air power early on uh not recently but i actually think it probably did enter production
[46:27.040 --> 46:32.320]  like i think the long story short of air power was that they they had an idea they thought they
[46:32.320 --> 46:37.760]  would ship it uh i think that those reports by the way there are other reports that that there
[46:37.760 --> 46:43.440]  was a company apple acquired after they announced it that was the company that they were relying on
[46:43.440 --> 46:48.000]  for the technology i think that's true that they acquired that company then but they already had
[46:48.000 --> 46:54.640]  people working on air power before that they didn't they they did not get up there and then
[46:54.640 --> 47:00.320]  now it's a product and then say okay now we got to go buy something to make this yeah um but they
[47:00.320 --> 47:07.440]  did hit effectively hit a reset button and do like a redesign months and months after they announced
[47:07.440 --> 47:14.800]  it and let's start over and they went with chi after because originally wasn't cheating no it
[47:14.800 --> 47:22.640]  was always chi no if i should re-watch that whole thing it was always chi compatible but it was more
[47:22.640 --> 47:30.800]  than chi so you would have been able right with the phil schiller's demonstrated model on stage
[47:30.800 --> 47:35.840]  at that iphone event it they said it's chi compatible so any chi device that you would have
[47:35.840 --> 47:41.760]  put on it would would have charged it's just that they were adding more than chi yeah so that they
[47:41.760 --> 47:47.840]  could have the bigger sweet spots uh and support the watch which doesn't and still doesn't support
[47:47.840 --> 47:54.320]  chi whatever the watch does is apple watch yeah unique you know it may be very similar to chi but
[47:54.320 --> 47:59.440]  it's not chi there isn't to my knowledge there's no chi pad you can put an apple watch on and have
[47:59.440 --> 48:07.440]  it charge and nor could you and i think that they got far enough along that they thought maybe you
[48:07.440 --> 48:13.120]  know maybe this will work and then it went into production like i think they got a design that
[48:13.120 --> 48:19.200]  they thought they could that might work and then it got into real production and at that point it
[48:19.200 --> 48:23.520]  it you know either didn't work or was unfeasible like this is there's too many of these that are
[48:23.520 --> 48:33.600]  failing it's too expensive you know um at you know it it's a screwed up story it's embarrassing
[48:33.600 --> 48:38.560]  for apple but at some level the system worked right they didn't ship charging pads that caught
[48:38.560 --> 48:46.400]  fire or got hot or broke after a day you know they made a uh they made a optimistic a wishful
[48:46.400 --> 48:51.760]  thinking era by announcing it before it was ready on the assumption that they they knew that they
[48:51.760 --> 48:56.080]  had technical hurdles left to solve but they figured out where apple will figure it out yeah
[48:57.440 --> 49:02.000]  and never actually shipped it like something really screwed up happened within samsung
[49:02.000 --> 49:05.440]  that the whatever you know like i said there had to be there had to be
[49:05.440 --> 49:07.840]  people in samsung who knew that this wasn't going to work
[49:09.680 --> 49:15.920]  and yet either they passed it up the chain and it was ignored by executives at a high enough
[49:15.920 --> 49:22.560]  level to make the decision that we nah we still want to be first or maybe their culture is such
[49:22.560 --> 49:28.080]  that people were afraid to pass it up the chain you know i you know the the chairman of samsung
[49:28.080 --> 49:32.400]  was the one who unveiled it you know maybe nobody wants to tell him you know you stood up and
[49:32.960 --> 49:38.800]  and unveiled a phone that we shouldn't ship it seems like a company like an organization i don't
[49:38.800 --> 49:43.120]  know i mean i that's possible i guess but it seems like that would be something that would
[49:43.120 --> 49:49.760]  be a problem constantly i don't know even more even more than the the two notable instances
[49:49.760 --> 49:58.000]  of the last whatever it was four years three or four years but well maybe it is the company to
[49:58.000 --> 50:03.120]  scramble around so much in the background to to make it work that uh it does they do get away
[50:03.120 --> 50:09.840]  with that it is the company that that shipped the note seven which exploded right and had to be
[50:09.840 --> 50:16.480]  recalled in a multi-billion dollar recall yeah i mean uh you know an exploding phone is obviously
[50:16.480 --> 50:22.720]  a far bigger problem than a phone that just doesn't work and shipped to lots of customers
[50:22.720 --> 50:29.520]  oh yeah it was it was a huge you know it was tons of them and they they kind of i was just reading
[50:29.520 --> 50:34.400]  about it to to refresh my memory they kind of bungled it too where they were late to really
[50:34.400 --> 50:39.280]  just give throw in the towel and just recall them all they were saying we've got a new supplier for
[50:39.280 --> 50:45.280]  batteries yeah so if you you know your serial number is in this you know right big range send
[50:45.280 --> 50:48.800]  it back to us and we'll put a good battery in and then they figured out the good batteries
[50:48.800 --> 50:53.200]  the whole thing it wasn't really the batteries it was just just design yeah
[50:56.320 --> 50:58.640]  i don't know i wouldn't want that job like
[51:00.960 --> 51:06.960]  i would i i wouldn't i wouldn't i wouldn't want could you imagine being like an engineer at apple
[51:06.960 --> 51:13.440]  at the level of where if you make a mistake your work is such like you're you're you're designing
[51:13.440 --> 51:18.480]  the connection between the lithium ion battery and the rest of the phone and if you really screw up
[51:19.200 --> 51:23.280]  iphones might catch on fire if i'm designing that connection there's already something wrong with
[51:23.280 --> 51:32.800]  your organization right something deeply deeply wrong i you know but some people have those jobs
[51:32.800 --> 51:39.360]  and i salute them yeah but the stakes are high right i mean it's it's not just at the personal
[51:39.360 --> 51:45.840]  level of feeling bad if somebody's leg catches fire they get burned but right i mean you i'd
[51:45.840 --> 51:51.760]  feel terrible if my if if i a bug in my software it caused somebody's leg to to get a burn uh
[51:52.800 --> 51:58.880]  but you know just in terms of also the importance to the company you know yeah i don't know it's
[51:58.880 --> 52:04.320]  it's a really i this it's fascinating like i i would just love to know how far up the chain
[52:04.320 --> 52:11.600]  that's got and where how i'd love to you know see the meeting where it was decided we're going to
[52:11.600 --> 52:18.080]  send these out to reviewers and ship it on friday anyway yeah mind-boggling all right i guess i
[52:18.080 --> 52:22.800]  should take a break that seems like a natural natural break thank our next sponsor it's our
[52:22.800 --> 52:30.720]  good friends at squarespace squarespace that's where you go to build a website you need a website

[52:50.560 --> 52:55.360]  the actual blog entries and the writing you want to start a podcast you can host it on squarespace
[52:55.360 --> 53:02.000]  i think hosting your own website whether it's a personal website your company uh an organization
[53:02.000 --> 53:06.640]  you're involved with some kind of you know local organization something like that having your own
[53:06.640 --> 53:12.880]  web website is so important and i really think it maybe in the last 10 years a lot of people shifted
[53:12.880 --> 53:18.960]  all of their online stuff to social media um like facebook and instagram and stuff like that and
[53:18.960 --> 53:22.720]  that stuff you know it's still important it hasn't gone away but i think everything we've seen
[53:22.720 --> 53:27.680]  with especially facebook in particular having that be your only online presence and being reliant on
[53:27.680 --> 53:32.880]  them it's putting something very important outside your control you have a website at squarespace
[53:32.880 --> 53:38.560]  everything's under your control from the design to the update to how everything looks and you get
[53:38.560 --> 53:43.440]  great analytics and stats it's just a great service you get great customer service and you

[54:18.720 --> 54:21.520]  my thanks to Squarespace for continuing to support this podcast
[54:23.520 --> 54:28.880]  all right what about all these rumors man i guess we got to get to that holy smokes and talk about
[54:28.880 --> 54:34.400]  another one where i think the meta story behind it is fascinating yeah and i i don't know it
[54:35.360 --> 54:43.360]  but man who who and how these things leaked all to one person garram Rambo who writes at 9 to 5
[54:43.360 --> 54:50.000]  at 9 to 5 mac uh like it's not like a whole bunch of stuff leaked to a whole bunch of people
[54:50.000 --> 54:55.120]  or a couple of people because that never happens with apple apple leaks you know it's hard to
[54:55.120 --> 55:02.720]  remember a time when there were lots of leaks to lots of sources um for whatever reason they keep
[55:02.720 --> 55:07.520]  a close enough lid but like you can never they can never seem to keep it completely sealed and
[55:07.520 --> 55:14.480]  there's always like one or two people out there who are getting leaks you know last couple years
[55:14.480 --> 55:21.840]  would be mark german um now though guillermo Rambo wow it it i don't even know where to start
[55:24.720 --> 55:34.560]  well it seems like he picked apart i was 13 and mac os 10.15 right i mean right yeah so it's i was
[55:34.560 --> 55:41.360]  13 most of the leaks it does seem it some of the clues it's not all there's no hardware right yeah
[55:42.800 --> 55:48.880]  yeah it's just it's both those operating systems so it's all software and maybe a little on the
[55:48.880 --> 55:59.440]  services side i don't think he has his hands on either of those pieces of software okay
[55:59.440 --> 56:04.000]  and you know because it's like some people are wondering if he'd somehow managed to get a copy
[56:04.000 --> 56:14.400]  i we had i i wondered yeah i still don't know it's and he's obviously uh protecting his source
[56:14.400 --> 56:20.160]  of course because because of well yeah he weren't that source would dry up very quickly what source
[56:20.160 --> 56:25.760]  is it may be sources like one of the things that's extraordinary about it is that he knows he's
[56:25.760 --> 56:34.160]  he's revealed a whole bunch of items across ios 13 and mac os 10.15 god that's getting so it's
[56:34.160 --> 56:39.760]  really hard to say that yeah it is i really wish that they would just drop the 10 and just
[56:44.960 --> 56:50.560]  and again i knew this was going to happen by the way just as an aside when they switched to
[56:50.560 --> 56:58.560]  naming the mac os versions i knew that i would soon start forgetting which one's which right
[56:58.560 --> 57:05.360]  oh yeah you know and they they've always had the nicknames for them you know like for some reason
[57:05.360 --> 57:13.040]  i remember that 10.4 was tiger uh or was it lion actually now i don't yeah i'm not sure that was
[57:13.040 --> 57:20.560]  that was 10.5 but i don't yeah there was cheetah and panther and and cheetah was a real lie because
[57:20.560 --> 57:25.520]  cheetah is of course the fastest animal on the planet and it was mac os 10 was dreadfully slow
[57:25.520 --> 57:31.040]  at the time just um painfully painfully slow at the time it was easier for me it was easier to
[57:31.040 --> 57:37.360]  remember the cats just because everybody knows the cats i mean a lot of the i'd like i've never
[57:37.360 --> 57:46.640]  been to these places so it's harder for me to picture in my mind oh that version is this place
[57:46.640 --> 57:52.480]  in california i can all you know numbers they go in order and then you can sit there you can figure
[57:52.480 --> 57:56.960]  out and and once you know the numbers you can sort of count backwards on your hand and go back
[57:56.960 --> 58:01.680]  to the year you know you can you know do a little subtraction there and you can get a year like at
[58:01.680 --> 58:06.800]  this point i'm there's like was there was i know the new one is mohawk and it's like
[58:06.800 --> 58:12.560]  one is mohavi and all my max are now on mohavi so i know that name but like what was sierra
[58:12.560 --> 58:16.240]  was there a sierra yeah and then there was a high sierra sierra and then high sierra sure
[58:17.360 --> 58:21.440]  but i can't remember if it went see to go high sierra
[58:26.560 --> 58:32.240]  there was elk capitan yeah but that and i think that was after yosemite i think i've got i guess
[58:32.240 --> 58:37.360]  i'm get i guess it's all come about there was yosemite and then el cap is the mountain in
[58:37.360 --> 58:44.400]  yosemite and so they use that okay so here we go okay yeah mavericks yosemite el capitan sierra
[58:44.400 --> 58:51.680]  high sierra mohave uh see mavericks forgot that one completely totally forgot that one well anyway
[58:53.360 --> 58:59.280]  the the breadth of the leaks that garam rambo has is extraordinary i don't think and i could be
[58:59.280 --> 59:06.560]  wrong i but from what i understand i have friends at apple it i don't think there are many people at
[59:06.560 --> 59:12.960]  apple who know about all of the things that he leaked it's there's a you know famously
[59:12.960 --> 59:19.680]  compartmentalized company that one of the ways that they keep things under wraps is that teams
[59:19.680 --> 59:24.880]  don't talk to other teams about what they're doing unless they're working together you know if they
[59:24.880 --> 59:30.640]  need to talk about it but you don't it's not like everybody who goes and works people might be you
[59:30.640 --> 59:39.680]  know going and working on important new tent pole features of ios 13 or features to specifically
[59:39.680 --> 59:46.960]  support the new iphones coming out in 2019 you know big important stuff for the company that
[59:46.960 --> 59:53.440]  gets the attention at the very highest executive levels they don't know like all the features that
[59:53.440 --> 01:00:00.240]  are going on in the mac for the same year it's just not how the company works like i really just
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:05.920]  don't think there are many people who have access to this the breadth of information that he
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:12.320]  published yeah and these are yeah these are these are kind of all over the place i mean it's all
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:19.200]  software basically but it's um some of the people some of the people who do know all of these things
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:25.600]  are people like that the highest levels of phil schiller's group and craig federate's group right
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:35.040]  i don't think like craig federate's right hand you know top executive you know managers underneath
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:42.800]  him are leaking these things to nine to five mac like and i would guess that those people uh like
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:51.680]  frank federate and phil schiller are angry about how these things right they would probably well
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:59.680]  yeah i mean so if it's one person they would know the person i i i i guess it was two years ago i
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:07.520]  think when i asked phil schiller on stage at wwdc which i guess i should talk about is my live show
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:14.560]  at wwdc are you coming by the way i might need you well you let me know if you need that will
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:20.320]  determine whether or not i'm coming it was two years ago all right fedorigi and phil schiller
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:27.120]  were on together and i asked something about the leaks and and that this really bothers you guys
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:35.440]  and and phil really got emotional and he's very cool on in that show like he he's very laid back
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:40.400]  very laid back but when he starts talking about leaks he he he can't help himself he gets very
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:45.040]  angry and like and i really think he means it i really think he means it that one of the big
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:50.720]  reasons that he gets upset is that he thinks about all of the individual teams who've been working
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:57.760]  sometimes for multiple years on something kept it under wraps and we're looking forward to having
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:05.040]  the world learn about their work in just the right way the way that apple wants to unveil it on stage
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:13.600]  in an event with the explanation of what it is why they're doing it how it works what it looks like
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:18.880]  done in the way that apple thinks is gives the biggest pop and the most puts it in the most
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:23.840]  accurate light and then to have that spoiled you know it just makes him angry because he you know
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:33.760]  he's he i really believe that i really believe that you know um i've seen it always happens
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:38.880]  it always happens when there's a big leak thing like this where somebody i've seen it on twitter
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:44.560]  where there's people who think i think apple did this on purpose to get people excited about wwdc
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:48.560]  there's no way all of this would leak if if they didn't want it to
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:57.520]  and all i can say is i mean i can't disprove that but no that is definitely not the case apple did
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:05.520]  not it doesn't when have they needed to do that right well i think that people underestimate
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:13.840]  how important apple considers it to announce things in the precise way that they want to
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:21.280]  and to explain them you know that they really they put more work into the keynotes than
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:28.400]  i think a lot of people like a hundred times maybe more work into the keynotes than people
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:34.320]  think that they some people think that they do like they are very very interested in and they
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:40.640]  think it's important to announce things in a way that people understand them correctly whereas
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:47.760]  this is not really that this again it's good work and he knows it and i i do think i mean part of
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:53.280]  what makes it curious is so mark german let's compare rambo and german german obviously has
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:59.760]  had a lot of good sources at apple over the years and has gotten leaks of information but he's not
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:06.720]  technical he's not a programmer he's you know just a reporter who who cultivates human sources
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:13.040]  like german to my knowledge has never done anything like discover a url that's public
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:17.840]  that shouldn't have been public which is one of the things that rambo and and stephen trout and
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:21.840]  is who's a friend yeah who they work together on some of this stuff and stephen trout and
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:26.400]  smith got credit at the bottom of a couple of these nine to five mac articles for helping
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:34.400]  rambo which makes me think that there is it could be yeah that they have access to software uh
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:40.880]  they're both extraordinarily clever and they're both really really talented at the to me black
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:50.640]  magic of getting these you know you you could give me the the ios 13 download and i i i wouldn't know
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.880]  what to do with that i have a computer i have a computer science degree i mean i'm not an idiot
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:00.800]  i'm not an idiot but i don't know how i would get in there and figure out that hey there's a new
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:08.320]  drawing recognition recognition thing that you'd fire you'd fire up res edit yeah exactly if if i
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:13.520]  could fire up res edit maybe i could figure something out no i if i had to do it i would
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:25.760]  i would i would get in contact with stephen so i guess i do right that's the only way right uh
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:35.200]  but i think it could also be though and i don't want to pry i'm i know stephen uh i don't really
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.640]  i don't know that i've ever been in contact with rambo but i know stephen trout and smith
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:48.720]  and you know we've i messaged about this a bit um you know more or less he just a couple of
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:52.960]  these popped and he just sent me a text message just to show you know send me the url so i'd see
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:58.320]  it early um and i'm not gonna pry because he's not they're not gonna tell me anyway i don't want
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:03.360]  to pry yeah and i don't i don't like asking questions i know that can't be answered um but
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:09.040]  i have admitted that i'm damn curious what the hell is going on yeah one of the other ideas that i
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:17.360]  you know was that maybe the source is like a build engineer at apple somebody who works on the
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:24.000]  the part of the operating system where it's like you take all of this various work
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:32.960]  and actually put it together into a ios 13 beta that can be installed on phones right which when
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:38.560]  you really think about how big these operating systems are is it seems like devilishly complicated
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:47.840]  work uh to actually turn dozens of different projects from wireless networking to screen
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:56.800]  recognition to pencil support to you know new apis for ar and put them all into a you know a single
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:06.000]  downloadable bundle that will properly install itself on iphones uh somebody who works in that
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.960]  area maybe would be the sort of person like one person might have access to an awful lot
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:19.520]  of information across the operating systems i don't know are there any of these things that
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:24.560]  they've revealed that you found particularly interesting i mean not not any more than any
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:31.120]  other ones i wouldn't say but like it's a it's kind of a hodgepodge i mean there's series stuff
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:37.920]  there's marzipan improvements there's augmented reality stuff and then um at at the highest level
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:42.640]  some of what they've revealed is stuff that we've all known from other rumors for a while
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:50.240]  which is primarily that the ipad is getting or should be getting at least uh a some significant
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:58.000]  updates to make it just to make productivity better on it some inner you know system level
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:05.520]  interface improvements to make side-by-side apps better uh multiple windows or i don't
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:11.840]  and i'm not sure windows seems like the wrong word because window to me is specifically a rectangle
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:16.560]  well it doesn't have to be a rectangle i guess if we go back to the those music player days
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:23.120]  right with with audio on and and sound jam we had a lot of windows that weren't rectangles
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:29.200]  um but it's a floating rectangle that you can drag around the screen and stack them
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:38.160]  in an overlapping fashion and possibly resize them yeah i mean like the video explain window right
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:46.480]  yeah um yeah so like the video player the heads up display is a window but most of what like like in
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:51.520]  safari those tabs aren't windows so i'm not quite sure and it doesn't seem clear from this leak
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:56.000]  whether they're windows like windows still seems wrong on the ipad it seems like they should all
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:03.920]  be like tiled and in fixed rectangular full height space but anyway some kind of way though that's
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:10.080]  system-wide you know apps will be able to have multiple things open at once so you'll be able
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:17.920]  to have i presume for example two emails open at once that you're writing like that's it is the
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:24.400]  thing i'm you know i i don't want to go on a whole mac versus ipad ramp but there's an awful lot of
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:30.320]  times where i have two half written emails open on my mac more than two unfortunately
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:37.840]  uh it's weird to me that something that some people can use like i'm not sure how
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:44.640]  people some people do it like if your ipad's your only device and i know that there's drafts but
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:49.040]  and you can do the thing in mail where you can flick it down to the bottom but none of it seems
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:54.240]  as elegant to me as just having a couple of emails open at once yeah right yeah anyway seems like
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:10:00.400]  some thinking along those lines has been which was rumored for last year and seemingly you know
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:09.360]  according to rumors uh which i believe was punted for not being ready so that stuff is coming the
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:13.920]  lots of marzipan stuff the one that i i've forgotten about was there's also the the watch
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:21.680]  authentication uh yeah what's different with that see i've lost i've forgotten half of these things
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:31.360]  well it's just it's about using the watch in order to do more stuff oh right right more things um
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:36.560]  right right right right that that your mac will be able to trust your watch for more things and
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:42.400]  you'll be able to use it for things that that the uh the modern macbooks that have the uh
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:46.640]  touch id sensor can use the touch id sensor for you'll just be able to use your watch instead yeah
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:52.480]  which which i think can be useful because i often use my macbook pro when it's you know closed and
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:58.240]  connected to a yeah uh a monitor and that's always annoying when you know i can't do that touch id
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:04.320]  thing to use passwords i love i love the feature that you can unlock your mac just open your
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:09.760]  macbook and yeah use the watch to to open it are you wearing your watch now i am wearing okay
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:15.600]  right now as we speak okay i don't wear it every day uh in fact i didn't wear it yesterday i have
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:20.000]  other watches i like to wear i wore a different watch yesterday and then i put my apple watch on
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:25.360]  this morning and it said you didn't move much yesterday john you can do it today
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:33.120]  and i i should have taken a screenshot of it i was like according to my watch my watch as far
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:38.720]  as my watch knows i didn't move at all yesterday i might have been dead so because i didn't i didn't
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:43.360]  touch my watch yesterday it does some of the move stuff with the phone right i mean so you'd think
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:48.480]  that the watch would ask the phone if you move i don't know yeah but i guess they they're not
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:53.440]  talking to each other i don't know i don't know but yeah it sounds like they're going to do more
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:57.920]  the other any other thing i can think of that you can do on the watch on your mac now is apple pay
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:02.480]  you can definitely confirm apple pay on a watch yeah um but that would be cool to have more stuff
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:08.720]  do that especially if third parties can can hook into it then if you have like an a password
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:14.160]  a password protected app you might be able to as an option say hey if you you know authenticate
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:20.240]  with apple watch instead of having to enter a password yeah that would be cool uh the marzipan
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:26.000]  stuff is obviously a big part of it uh that was one of the first leaks they had where there's
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.960]  going to be uh and i think i do think they structured them well like i think they started
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:36.560]  with the biggest story which was this uh that there's going to be separate music podcasts and
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:46.560]  tv apps on the mac uh which we assume will be the marzipan versions of the yes that are coming and
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:52.080]  i believe they suggest that they are and a new a new books app a replacement for the books app
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:13:00.480]  with uh that'll probably also be marzipan uh and yeah i guess we should definitely talk about that
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:07.120]  i feel like this the the long-awaited breakup of itunes uh needs to be talked about i thought the
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:11.840]  atp guys i thought they had a really good segment on it that i i won't repeat but there was a recent
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:19.760]  episode of atp where marco was a bit pessimistic about this like we might be you know we've we've
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:24.480]  all been frustrated for years that itunes has gotten a bit cluttered and it takes on more stuff
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:28.880]  you know and it used to be an app that it the funny thing that like maybe the tragic part is
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:35.040]  it was beloved when it came out oh yeah right when itunes came out man people loved it because
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:40.560]  everybody had just been managing their not everybody because i know there was sound jam
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:45.440]  which was actually the roots of itunes and and panic had their audio on app but you had to be
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:50.800]  like an indie mac fan nerd to even heard of either of those apps at this point like normal people if
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:59.760]  they had mp3 files they just had them like in a folder on their desktop right it like just throw
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:04.480]  them all in here just pop a cd in your mac and hit one button and it'll all be organized and they're
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:10.720]  all be named right right like you know we didn't back when we were pirating all these songs the
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:19.520]  file names were wrong zero zero one right the artist empty string you know you know just you
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:24.880]  just you know you know which song was what yeah beat beatle songs and you put it on your rio and
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:31.280]  just yeah right beatle songs with like a release date of 1999 because that was like the cd it was
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:39.040]  you know i probably still have those yeah but it was a mess and itunes came out and it was
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:46.640]  glorious and it was apple at its best and and the the the eye of saron steve jobs himself obviously
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:53.440]  was passionate about this app and when he said he loves music everybody knew it was true and
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:15:00.320]  that this app was meant to be the music playing app that steve jobs would not just use but want
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:05.760]  to use and even some of the stuff that was extraneous like the uh the screensavers what
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:10.720]  did they call those the oh yeah they're still in there um yeah they're still in there everything's
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:15.840]  still in there that's the problem but it just seemed cool because then you if you were setting
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:21.680]  up your mac to play music it wouldn't just look like a dumb uh list of songs it you'd have as
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:26.080]  great visualizer doesn't that what they call it yes yes yeah it makes your mac look like a cool
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:30.960]  thing yeah while you're pumping music for your party or whatever right uh people loved it and
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:37.920]  then it grew over time and you know took on all this responsibility where i think yeah it seems
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:46.880]  like when the the iphone took off yeah is when it really went poorly you know it went too far
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:52.240]  because now it had to handle the apps and that whole process was and then i'd handle
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:58.160]  backing up the phone and doing all that right and then it became ridiculously cumbersome
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:05.760]  just small amounts of accumulation of technical debt that made sense every step of the way but
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:10.240]  eventually you're so many steps into it where it's like wow how did we get here it was like
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:15.120]  well of course itunes was used to manage your ipod that was almost probably half the reason
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:19.760]  they made the thing and it was great it was like you just plug your ipod in and you get all your
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:24.560]  same playlists and all your music it just all if you had just ripped a cd you didn't have to
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:30.320]  do anything you just plug your ipod in and then all that new music was now on your ipod um and
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:34.800]  then when they made the iphone they were like well we need some kind of data port well we've
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:39.680]  already got 30 pin connector from the ipod why don't we use the same port and then we could use
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:44.800]  the same cables and once you have that it's like well then how are we going to get software updates
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:49.600]  and stuff like that or how are we going to get your music onto your iphone because that was like
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:55.040]  well we'll have well why don't we just have itunes treat the iphone as like an ipod
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:01.120]  you know and it all made sense and then all of a sudden you know there's there's an app store
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:12.160]  in itunes like that it was weird right like it in hindsight it is very very strange that the if you
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:18.480]  would think of the way you felt about itunes when it first came out in 2000 or 2001 whenever that
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:23.280]  was and then think about the fact that it eventually was filled up with dozens of mobile
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:28.480]  games yeah and we have at least you know gotten to the point i think we've got to the point where
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:34.640]  we don't do all that other man the iphone management stuff is not done in itunes any
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:40.320]  part by most people do you i don't even you do backups in it no i don't either i did for a long
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:45.040]  time i did for a long time but then i you know i bit the ball and bought more icloud storage and
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:52.480]  we just use icloud that's a lot easier well and i also find that that apple has quietly you know
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:59.920]  you know i sometimes hate to misuse it quietly but without much acclaim has made itunes or icloud
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:07.280]  restore really really good yeah like it it comes in at about as fast as i could reasonably hope
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:14.240]  that it would over wi-fi yeah and and it's gotten to me a lot it's become more determinate like in
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:19.840]  the early years of it it just seemed like indeterminate like well wait i don't have any
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:28.400]  photos yet and i don't see anything spinning hmm just wait and then i come back and i've got 323
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:34.320]  photos and it's like well i've got a lot more than 323 photos i've got thousands of photos let me go
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:40.000]  look on my old iphone how many photos do i have i'm like i have 19 000 photos and then eventually
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.920]  it would have a thousand photos and then you know a day or two later it would they'd all be there
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:50.800]  but i i would just just show me a spinner and say you're working on it right you just don't you
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:57.120]  don't have to update each number you don't have to go 13 233 13 234 you don't have to show me
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:01.360]  just just show me that something's going on and i think they've gotten a lot better at that in my
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:05.920]  experience and i tend to use it a lot because i get all these review phones and i just do them
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:13.280]  all over the icloud restore or set them up as new or something like that yeah because the other
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:17.760]  thing too is that the using itunes for it was always a little confusing like that was one of
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:21.680]  those areas where i don't think they really got the interface right because it was like
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:28.480]  if you didn't encrypt your backups they didn't include pass an awful lot of important stuff
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:35.280]  passwords especially thing i think but right which makes sense but then maybe it should have
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:39.120]  been encrypted from by default instead of unencrypted by default yeah i think it should
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:43.440]  have been and i think that they didn't want to encrypt it by default because it was serious
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:47.360]  encryption and they didn't want to deal with all the people who'd forget their passwords
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:51.440]  and then literally have to say to them there's nothing we can do
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:59.760]  i guess that's the thought process but in addition to i think maybe discouraging more people from
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:03.440]  doing what they should have been doing i just think the the whole explanation of it in the
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:10.240]  interface was never quite clear like it was never clear that if you did encrypt it you would you
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:15.760]  would have a much better experience so long as you remembered it right it was it made it seem
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:20.400]  as though it was just about like hey if you're spooked about having your backup unencrypted on
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:25.520]  your hard drive because somebody might poke around in it then encrypt it i don't think they made it
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:32.080]  clear at all that if you encrypt it it'll also include a lot more of your stuff yeah definitely
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:38.080]  not so anyway are you excited what do you think so marco's take i don't want to well so yeah
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:44.160]  the idea right is that we'll get these these apps will be ported over from ios to the mac
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:50.560]  and itunes isn't going to go away really at least not to begin with because it does a whole bunch
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:56.400]  of other things that are not included in those apps obviously but you won't have to deal with
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:02.400]  it if you don't want to on like a regular basis so well that seems like i mean you know that seems
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:09.520]  like a big improvement it may not be exactly you know i think we would probably think i mean who
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:14.160]  knows it depends on how the the apps are you know how well the apps reported over right as long as
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:20.000]  their mac as long as their mac feeling that'll go a long way towards making that process less
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:28.640]  painful but if it's like what was done you know with news and stocks and whatever it where it's
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:34.320]  just like it slapped it's and now it's in a window and you can run it on the mac which i don't think
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:41.360]  it will be but i guess the concern and the atp concern is hey everybody wanted itunes broken up
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:45.200]  because it seemed like it was too much in one app and kind of got crufty um
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:50.640]  but in the be careful what you wish for category of here you go everything's broken up and then
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:57.920]  you get these apps that might be too simplistic like there is if it's just the mac music player
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:06.320]  is just the ipad music player in a mac window you lose an awful lot of stuff that itunes can
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:13.280]  do smart playlists and complicated interfaces for making complicated smart playlists and
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:20.560]  part of what we love about apple at its best is this their ability to
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:28.320]  give you an app i got the classic you know the old itunes in the early days is a perfect example
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:32.880]  we're at a basic level it worked for everybody you know anybody who really just wanted to play music
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:37.920]  on their computer had a pretty simple interface that you can you know you could navigate by
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:42.320]  artist and by album people could figure it out just by looking at it and then you could
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:47.040]  just by looking at it and play but if you wanted to do things like make complicated
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:55.600]  smart playlists with ends and ores to exclude this and include that they had an interface for it and
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:23:00.880]  you didn't have to write it in a programming language you didn't have to do it by apple script
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:05.280]  it was a nice little interface like you know you get for making mail filters
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:14.160]  in other words letting you use your computer as a computer right and i feel like at a very flippant
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:21.040]  high level uh description part of what i think frustrates some of us about apple in recent years
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:26.000]  is not really letting you use your computers as computers anymore
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:31.920]  taking away some of that computeriness and making them more abstract devices yeah
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:38.000]  you know like this only is a good idea if these apps are actually very good mac
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:43.840]  apps that let you do useful and powerful things right are there other examples of them like smart
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:50.480]  playlists that well i mean it seems like what about letting you manage is this new music app
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:56.400]  going to let you manage a local local pile of music if that's what you want to do right there's
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:02.400]  there's the maybe the biggest level right like what if you've got and as old-fashioned an idea
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:08.160]  that is for kids today who really have grown up in the streaming era and i kind of get the beauty of
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:14.720]  the streaming thing where you don't you you're never going to lose your music you know it although
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:19.600]  i guess artists can leave your streaming service and you lose access so but you don't have anything
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:26.400]  to worry about and it seems very simple right um you know and and with things like netflix it
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:32.400]  doesn't even make any sense i mean i suppose there's some people with piles of ripped blu-rays
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:38.240]  and dvds and things that were downloaded off the back of a truck yeah as they say but for those
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:43.600]  people for those people there's plex or something like that right yeah they they do have software i
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:48.320]  mean your days of using itunes for that kind of stuff are basically over a long time i've been
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:55.840]  over for years right uh so i don't know music is a little bit different and yeah i only came trying
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:01.520]  to remember like because there were times when i would edit dates and things because it would be
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:05.440]  the date of something and and i think there were some in itunes that are even still like that like
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:11.120]  it's a like if they remaster something yeah it's the date of that the remaster instead of the date
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:18.640]  of the original song which always bonkers like okay these Beatles songs are not from the 90s
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:26.160]  here's one that will surprise absolutely no one who knows me uh long ago like when i had a big
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:33.920]  pile of music all in itunes it eventually made me i couldn't stand it anymore that i had a whole
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:40.800]  bunch of songs where all of the apostrophes were stupid straight apostrophes so i i wrote and you
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:45.840]  know where it really drove me nuts is when i is when i got the uh when i was using an ipod
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:53.920]  the early ipods where they used the old classic chicago bitmap typeface the classic mac one yeah
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:26:01.040]  because the difference between the dumb apostrophe and the the curly apostrophe is really really
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:05.920]  glaring in that font and it's such a nice it's such a nice improvement in it so i wrote apple
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:12.880]  script and i fixed all of my songs like hundreds and i didn't go by hand and type it i wrote an
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:17.680]  apple script and i don't know if it took me less time to write the script to do it then it would
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:23.280]  have to do it by hand but that sort of thing feels at least felt like i saved tons of time yeah and
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:29.680]  it was extremely satisfying to me ever after that where all of my album names and song names that
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:36.240]  had apostrophes or quotes had uh typographically correct ones i it made me very very happy um
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:41.920]  and it also it made me a little mad too that a lot of the ones i had were from the itunes store
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:45.200]  uh and it's like i you know i feel like apples should have gotten that right
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:52.080]  but i could fix it and it did wasn't too hard yeah uh i really really doubt the new music app
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:57.600]  from marzipan is going to be apple scriptable in fact i'm pretty sure well maybe not i take that
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:03.280]  back i think steven trotton smith proved that it could be uh so i won't say couldn't but i
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:09.360]  think it's extraordinarily unlikely that an app the whole point of this this developer framework
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:14.960]  is to share a code base with ios which doesn't have apple script would be apple scriptable
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:21.040]  you know so that's the sort of thing and there's tons of itunes apple script out there itunes is
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:25.680]  wonder is a wonderfully apple scriptable application there's the doug's apple script site
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:30.960]  has so many great song uh tools out there if you've ever wanted to do weird things with your
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:38.160]  itunes browsing his website and finding a bunch of scripts is super fun i really doubt we're gonna
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:44.640]  get that yeah i will well i certainly don't think we'll get it to begin with but right it seems like
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:49.520]  the thing that the kind of thing that might migrate over time well or they just have to
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:55.920]  keep maintaining itunes right well they might but will itunes share a music library with the music
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:00.640]  app there's i mean that's just a technique i don't know i think it seems like the music app will
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:05.920]  do whatever you know will take whatever's in your cloud right which is that's a good question are
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:09.520]  they going to be completely separate yeah because then you'd have you'd have to have twice the space
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:13.600]  if they're separate if you're storing them right on the device which i don't think anybody wants
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:20.240]  to do and what mine's like 23 megabytes or something it's fairly and it's reasonably large
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:24.480]  and i you know i i really have to say i don't not megabytes i don't want it's bigger than that
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:30.000]  i don't want to spend too much time bitching about marzipan again i think i've beaten that
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:35.760]  horse to death but and i'm not sure even calling it marzipan is the right thing to do because i
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:42.800]  believe i hope i'm not fooling myself with wishful thinking but i think i also have reason to believe
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:50.880]  that the marzipan we know today from the mojave apps news stocks voice recorder and home
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:29:00.720]  they are clearly from the ios versions of those apps painfully so because you can they just look
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:05.120]  like ios apps run some of them especially like home just looks like an ios app running in an
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:14.400]  em you know this the simulator yeah but it's really part of the reason that it was unveiled
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:21.600]  at wwdc last year as a preview is that what they had to for those apps was only the tip of the
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:30.240]  iceberg so to say of other developer things that will help make these apps not look like ios apps
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:37.040]  running in an emulator yeah that there's a whole bunch of developer stuff along that line and you
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:41.360]  know what we've seen is different but boy if these apps are like those apps that would be
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:46.800]  that would not be good in my opinion yeah it's sort of like the classic the classic max stage
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:54.000]  before going to yeah but i guess that's one of the other tidbits they revealed is that
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:00.880]  is that marzipan apps will be able to open more than one window which again as a bullet point
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:10.800]  isn't really it's not really a a hey that's a cool new feature for this year's marzipan
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:17.200]  it's really just condemning the marzipan that they decided to ship with mojave a year ago
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:22.000]  that they shipped it in a state where it still wasn't capable of opening more than one window
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:28.160]  like which to me in the uh news app is one example i think it's absolutely preposterous
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:31.920]  that you're supposed to treat this as a news app and there's no way to open more than one article
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:36.080]  at a time yeah like if you have a long article and you want to finish reading it later but
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:41.680]  keep reading some new stuff it really seems pretty obvious to anybody who's ever used
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:49.040]  a macintosh that you should be able to double click a story and have it open i mean anyway
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:53.920]  anyway and voice recorders is another one where it's it seems absolutely ridiculous that you can't
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:59.840]  have two recordings open at a time on a mac it's ridiculous so you know that's a good sign like
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:04.560]  that's one small bullet point that seems like a silly little thing but i think it it it's that
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:12.640]  bullet point really is a hint that the true marzipan story is way deeper than what they
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:17.120]  revealed last year they just had to reveal this little bit of it because they wanted
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:21.680]  a news app for mac because they knew they were going to do this apple news plus thing and
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:32.400]  etc yeah yeah i i find i find still find that app supremely frustrating i still and i and it
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:37.120]  drives me crazy because people will send me links and they're and they're often links that are
[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:43.120]  apple news links i'm just like oh god please don't do you know what i have a service i see i used to
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:48.720]  publish stuff like this all the time and i should get back into doing it i i i wrote a service you
[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:54.240]  know system you know like an automated thing so it's on your mac and it's in your services menu
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:32:00.640]  and it'll take any apple news url and just you select it in any app and run the service and it
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:04.960]  turns it into the original url for the story oh give me so you don't have to like give me
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:13.520]  all right it works it's pretty simple actually but uh hopefully i'm trying to think if it relies on
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:18.880]  any weird pearl stuff that i have that everybody doesn't have anyway i'll all right i promise you
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:24.320]  i don't promise that everybody will get it but i'll look into it that i don't care about
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:29.760]  but it is super frustrating i hate getting an apple news url yeah and i had like i had a story
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:33.680]  open in news and then someone sent me a link and i clicked on the link and it opened in news and
[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:37.680]  like the story that i wanted to read that i've been sort of saving it open that i wanted to
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:42.000]  read was just gone like and i couldn't go back to it it was when i click back it would take me to
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:50.560]  the home page so yeah this is not helpful um yeah and i get it you know and just yeah i am going to
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:56.240]  beat the mars a little bit like but for example i and like i just think that the voice memos app
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:33:00.880]  is just atrocious it's just a really bad mac app but then people will say well it's better than
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:07.200]  nothing because i have voice recordings on my phone and before this there was no way to get
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:13.120]  them on my mac and now they sync through icloud and at least have my recordings on my mac it's
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:20.240]  better than nothing and i will concede that it is better than nothing but you know better than
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:26.240]  nothing as a company's slogan slogan is a lot different than insanely great yeah right like
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:31.920]  it used to be that we celebrated apple for making things insanely great and now we're saying better
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:41.600]  than nothing like that's true but there have been lots of transitional moments i mean like i was
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:45.760]  talking about like the classic you know when you had to go the classic interface when we were going
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:53.120]  from you know os9 to os10 those right i'm hoping that that's what we're in right now with this
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:58.240]  right like what you're saying when you'd you'd have to open up a classic app because there was
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:02.560]  no native yeah carbon yeah and you'd open it up and it would look like the old you know it looked
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:08.400]  like os9 because you were basically running two operating systems right right right yeah
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:15.600]  no better than nothing which was yeah better than nothing but that's different though that to me
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:21.600]  though that was your it was clearly that's the old thing and you're hanging on to it whereas this is
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:25.920]  a the thing that's different about this is that these are new things this voice memos app is new
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:33.600]  for the mac and it's coming you know i i don't excuse it as well i don't think i think it's so
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:38.480]  i think it's a little more it's not as clear cut because it's not as clear a dividing line
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:44.240]  but right but in but in a way it is still it's still sort of it's a transition because we're
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:51.920]  moving and theoretically i think we're moving from those ios apps will not be the same either
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:56.800]  it's not just a matter of moving the ios apps to to the mac and making them more mac like we're
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:02.000]  the hope i think is that you know based on some of the other rumors that those the the way the
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:09.680]  ios apps themselves will be changing to make them a little bit more mac like yeah yeah the classic
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:13.760]  transition now the more i think about it i get it that it's a transition so i think you're right on
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:19.520]  that part but the difference is that and i think apple itself did a very good job right from the
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:25.920]  get-go of having all of that their stuff was native on mac os 10 they nativized everything
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:32.160]  and if you were using apple software you i mean there might be some exceptions but yeah you know
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:37.360]  for the most part the whole idea of classic was for third-party stuff and apple couldn't make them
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:42.480]  and there was no way i understand enough about how it works there was no possible way that they
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:50.640]  could make a classic version of an app look like a native mac os 10 app you know it had to look like
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:55.120]  what it was it's just the nature of how it works whereas there was no reason that apple couldn't
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:36:02.640]  write really great mac apps for news and stocks and voice recorder you know yeah that there's
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:08.000]  just no reason not to like it's just very alarm i don't know i don't want to keep going on okay
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:17.440]  all right i just i just really hope that one of my key hopes maybe my single biggest hope for wwdc
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:23.760]  this year is that when they unveiled the the the here's the real marzipan will be like what
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:28.320]  the hell were they thinking last year right as opposed to thinking oh god that was the beginning
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:37.360]  of the end like i don't want to be too dramatic but i honestly think if that's an actual if those
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:42.080]  apps actually represent what apple thinks the future of the mac is it's the end of the mac
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:48.560]  i mean it sounds terribly dramatic but i really hope it was just that that for once they actually
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:57.760]  thought well better than nothing uh what else what else is in these leaks uh there's so there's the
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:05.440]  bit about combining find my friends and find oh yeah iphone and then that came with another little
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:13.200]  tidbit about them yeah selling like tile yeah style things that you have fixed affixed to
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:18.160]  something that you lose frequently and then you know your keys whatever and then you can use that
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:23.200]  app to find anything right that you find anything that you've attached the thing to yeah and it
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:28.320]  sounds that sounds like a weird product for apple to make yeah although i mean it make it makes
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:33.440]  sense with that app and given that they have all that infrastructure it doesn't seem like that
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:40.960]  that extra piece is that hard to build right yeah it's it does seem like that and it does seem like
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:50.160]  a sticky thing yeah it does seem like a good idea to combine the two apps um you know the tile
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:57.280]  product is very curious i'm guessing just purely a guess but i'm guessing that that tile thing is
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:03.920]  is not a wwdc announcement that that is something right that the support for it's in the os i guess
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:08.960]  which would suggest they think they're gonna they might ship it within the next year but that seems
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:16.080]  like something that they would unveil in like september alongside new iphones right uh but yeah
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:24.960]  really interesting before sometimes i worry too i worry too about like apple stuff being too
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:32.320]  expensive uh like i really do think i don't think anybody at apple was fooled about like how popular
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:39.280]  home pod was going to be at 350 like i think they kind of knew that like in a market full of
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:46.320]  70 speaker things that people think are fun 350 is really high but it really is like a 350 product
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:50.480]  although they just cut the price a little bit right yeah like 329 now or yeah or 300
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:57.360]  uh well i think they're i think that as they can as they can reduce the price i think they
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:03.600]  are reducing the price i don't think it's i don't think it's so much a sign that uh they're it sales
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:07.120]  are so bad they have to cut the price i think it's that production costs have gone down so
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:14.240]  they can reduce the price but they built a very expensive speaker system 300 bucks i worry that
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:22.720]  apple might build 300 tile trackers i worry i worry that apple will charge you a service fee
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:29.040]  every month to track certain like it's it's four dollars a month to track your keys
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:35.840]  do you is there anything that you would use that for no i don't think i don't think so there's
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:41.920]  nothing that i i mean i'm pretty and i i may be like more meticulous than most about keeping track
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:53.040]  of things um so i rarely i i never lose my keys i almost never lose my keys i almost never lose
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:40:00.720]  my keys uh and i'm pretty part of it is just by being fairly rigorous about only putting them
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:05.680]  that's right exactly in there's one place where i put them when i when i come back in the house
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:13.040]  they go right in the drawer right it's either in the drawer in my pocket or in the car right uh
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:19.920]  and what else you put on the dog that might be cute that might be helpful yeah i think he's
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:26.560]  already chipped and in theory you know you could put it on a bag like i did have amy got me the
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:31.280]  tile trackers a few years ago as a gift and so i did put one in my back i didn't know what else to
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:38.000]  do i put it in my backpack uh but i never lost my backpack and never used it and then the battery
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:44.400]  died yeah and the tile tracker the end yeah the end that was the end of the story uh very sweet
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:48.320]  gift it's clever because i had been thinking about it and it is certainly it was you know
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:53.600]  but the only thing i really used it for was testing it you know like i'd hide it somewhere
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:59.200]  and see if i could find it yeah oh there it is but anyway interesting interesting unveil there
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:03.520]  the um yeah i think that we just spent like two days trying to find karen's um
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:09.840]  i uh air pod case see but that wouldn't help right because you couldn't put a tile on that
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:14.880]  i kind of wish the airport case had why could you not put a tile on that well i don't know maybe
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:19.360]  if it's small enough yeah i mean what would you well i'm i'm i don't know i maybe i'm over
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:24.400]  imagining and for some reason i was imagining apples would be a lot smaller than the tile
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:29.280]  one but i don't i guess it probably wouldn't know why i made that jump i just figured it's gonna be
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:34.240]  way smaller because that's always been my problem with the tile thing one of my problems with it it
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:37.840]  seems like it's i'm not gonna put one of those on my keys well i mean because i don't lose my
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:42.160]  keys very much but it's another thing to put on my keys and i've already got too many keys
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:50.080]  uh yeah uh keys are the obvious one but i don't lose my keys and and my daily carry key thing is
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:55.280]  just one key so okay yeah so we have two cars and so i've got two fobs and then we have like
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:05.520]  door keys you know two door keys mailbox key key to my in-laws house yeah yeah i don't have
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:09.280]  anything anyway keys are the obvious solution but it seems like apple wouldn't do it if it
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:14.400]  was just keys so maybe there's more to this you know i wouldn't be surprised if there's a lot more
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:19.920]  to it or if when they announced whatever the thing is if it's so different that we have to think
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:24.480]  before we go back and think oh wait about remember rambo's nine-to-five leak about the tile tractors
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:29.600]  that's that you know like it might be that sort of story where it's really the tip of the iceberg
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:35.200]  so what else was there let me look at this
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:41.920]  hmm oh dark mode's coming to ios another one that was long rumored yeah but this seemingly confirms
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:52.000]  it um that seems weird are you a dark mode person um i am usually not always but uh i think it
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  depends to me well not on the mac no um i i was thinking like in in-app dark dark modes um so
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:06.960]  like in uh tweetbot etc uh i i tend to use them i've run i've run bb edit in dark mode for many
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:13.120]  years i long ago i used to every three months or so get bored and switch switch the theme i guess
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:19.760]  i had forgotten it has a dark mode well for years it wasn't really like a system-wide dark mode for
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:24.160]  the app like the fine dialogue still looked like a regular platinum appearance whatever you wanted
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:28.080]  to call aqua appearance it's just that the actual text is not the same but it's the same
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:32.240]  aqua appearance it's just that the actual text editor area would have a dark background with
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:38.240]  light colors and bb edit is such a minimal app that whatever color the text background is really
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:44.320]  is what color the app looks like um but i've for years now i've kept it in dark mode and it's just
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:49.680]  somehow it sticks in my head and i use it so often i use it every day i i like having it be in this
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:53.360]  very visually distinctive state where it doesn't look like all these other apps with a white
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:58.320]  background but yeah i do that i do that with terminal i i yeah so terminal is another one
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:03.120]  where i use like a blue background in terminal so it doesn't look like bb edit with a dark dark gray
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:07.040]  background so terminal and bb edit i've always used a dark background just to have it look
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:12.560]  different yeah and i can't explain it justify it's probably just purely arbitrary and i could train
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:17.600]  myself to use dark mode system-wide but i don't but i don't even use i never use it on the iphone
[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:24.000]  i don't it i don't know if it's my eyes or what but um i pretty much run every app in that light
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:29.280]  mode all day long it's terminal the only i know it's terminal the only thing you can run and run
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:35.680]  opaque like yeah i think so yeah well it's the only one where they expose it yeah yeah so i do
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:39.200]  i do a black background and make it slightly see-through and have a green text so it looks
[01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:49.840]  like a yeah uh it looks very um matrixy uh uh trying to think so dark mode i know people are
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:56.160]  nuts for it there's uh an introduction of a new standard undo gesture for the text input on ipad
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:45:01.680]  you'll do a three finger tap or slide left and right or something to do undo and redo
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:07.040]  and no you think ah that may not be discoverable but there's some apparently some sort of like hey
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:11.440]  first time you're running it they're gonna tell you hey you can do this and you can undo so that's
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:17.200]  good i was confused at first because i remembered that my ipad has undo buttons above the keyboard
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:24.640]  but i had forgotten that the ipad pros as of today have a totally different keyboard than non-pro
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:31.920]  ipads so the ipad pros have like extra buttons like undo and redo that other ipads don't even
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:37.600]  if they're running the same version of ios 12 and the other ipads can still do the split view
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:42.800]  where you drag the keyboard up and it splits into two halves and inexplicably inexplicably this is
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:48.240]  one of the most inexplicable things in all of apple to me the bigger ipads the pros don't have
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:55.360]  the feature very weird i'm the more i think about i get so frustrated i cannot believe it like when
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:46:03.040]  i i try to end the work day and put the mac away and then you know use the ipad and my ipad and
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:08.640]  iphone at in the nighttime is more of a relaxation day i can't believe when i want to type out even
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:14.320]  just a tweet i type so much worse on my ipad than i do on my iphone i'll actually put my ipad down
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:20.160]  take out my iphone and right there so that i can just use my thumbs yeah anyway but it wasn't like
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:25.360]  that on the original ones right i mean you and the original pros you know you could split it i think
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:29.760]  it's just the new ones yeah when they changed the size when they made it bigger than which made me
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:34.560]  think like maybe it had something to do with like the the camera like the face id thing but i
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:41.200]  that doesn't make any sense yeah i don't know uh what else font management is getting a major
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:49.280]  update upgrade on ios uh and i wrote that that's a true finally for this one uh because it just
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:59.120]  seems crazy and you if you would have told me back in you know 1992 that you know 17 years from now
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:02.960]  apple would have an eight-year-old personal computer platform that didn't let you install
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:10.320]  your own fonts i would have shit my pants i would have thought you know like i would have thought
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:16.000]  oh my god i'll bet i'll bet larry allison bought the company and you know turned it into a division
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:22.720]  of oracle or something you know like there's no other way how could that be possible so you know
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:27.520]  for something that people are supposed to quote-unquote work on it's you know i really hope
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:34.240]  that they they do a nice job with that because it seems important yeah then there's this um sidecar
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:43.040]  thing what's that so that's where you can use the ipad as a oh yeah yeah that sounds interesting
[01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:48.480]  another monitor right which looks like you know several people are business i guess
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:57.600]  or is it do you have i have i have the luma product luna a little red luna that's a little
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:04.880]  red dongle that you put on your mac and then it it acts as a display port or whatever thunderbolt
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:09.280]  i forget which version i have for my old mac but whatever it looks to a mac like it's an external
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:15.040]  display but it's really just a little dongle little tiny dongle plugged in but then it shoots
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:20.800]  the image over to the luna app on your ipad and you can use the ipad and it works pretty well and
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:26.720]  i have and i've you know so i spent a hundred dollars or whatever it costs to see it and was
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:33.200]  impressed and never used it because i have no need for it yeah that's why that's why i don't have it
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:38.080]  i'm sure it's useful for i mean i can think that there are many people who would have that yeah
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:43.920]  yeah yeah that need well but it also seems and as impressive as it is that a third party shipped
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:48.560]  that product and got it has it working as well as they do um it really seems like it's something
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:53.680]  that has to be built into the system to really work well and to get the api support so that
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:49:01.040]  mac apps can totally understand that they might be getting apple pencil input yeah right because
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:09.280]  that's even though that's sort of the holy grail of yeah yeah of that application right uh trying
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:13.600]  to think i guess there's not much more it's not worth going through them all one by one other than
[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:21.680]  the that basic general uh uh meta story of how in the world did all this stuff leak right let me
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:26.160]  take a break here and thank our third and final sponsor and i'm very excited about this because
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:33.600]  it's a long time favorite of mine things from cultured code look we all have things to do
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:40.800]  things helps you achieve your goals things started life as an award-winning mac app now has
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:48.880]  ios counterparts in fact the ios app was one of the first 500 apps in the app store terrific rock
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:53.600]  solid sync between all of the clients so you can keep everything in sync across all your devices
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:50:01.280]  and always has had a terrific interface two-time apple design award winner very very cool interface
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:06.800]  very simple to use but they had a major redesign with things version 3 just two years ago and since
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:12.800]  then since the redesign two years ago they've been adding features at a very very regular clip
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:16.960]  this is one this is an app it doesn't bother badger you with updates but updates come on a
[01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:21.600]  regular basis and they're very significant and they just keep adding support for new stuff
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:27.440]  the latest and greatest in the os so maybe you tried it long ago cited against it if you looked
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:33.280]  at it a while back it really is worth taking a fresh look because it's just keeps getting better
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:38.960]  and better it's very simple to do the easy stuff just organizing to do's they have a system-wide
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:43.920]  shortcut for quick entry which makes it really easy to add something from anywhere and they've
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:48.400]  added new features like mail to things you can send email from any device anywhere have it added
[01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:52.800]  to your things account they have tags which is very very important to me i don't know that i
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:57.280]  would use the app without it that's how i like to organize my stuff you tag stuff then you can look
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:02.640]  at everything tagged with the same tag get them all grouped together you can add elaborate notes
[01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:08.160]  to an individual item you can add checklists to an individual item or an item can just be you know
[01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:15.280]  just a simple reminder to uh you know go to the grocery store it really has you covered for the
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:23.040]  simplest stuff to organizing really complex projects in a way that the whole project is
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:28.960]  there when you want to look at it but your just list of stuff you want to do today is in a
[01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:35.600]  separate area the app all very well organized beautiful to look at and easy to use super easy
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:42.640]  to figure out uh and hey they support all sorts of stuff in the os on the mac they have action
[01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:47.120]  and today extensions so you can see it over there in your little uh today area on the right side of
[01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:54.240]  your mac they have a watch app they integrate with the system reminders and calendar siri
[01:51:54.240 --> 01:52:02.320]  shortcuts and one of my favorites apple script support it's a great great mac app it really is
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:08.400]  i use it every day i've been using it for years and it's it really it's one of my favorite apps
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:12.480]  now if you think it might be of a nurse to you here's what you do they have a free trial for the
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:21.040]  mac just go to their website things app.com download the app get a free trial do not have
[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:27.840]  to pay anything just try it what why not try things if you aren't already using it it really
[01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:35.920]  is a great app makes me happy every day and i just love to see a terrific native mac app
[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:43.040]  native mac app continue to be updated and do so well um so my thanks to things for supporting
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:49.840]  the talk show uh anything else is there anything we missed on this before we wrap it up uh any
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:56.320]  other stories um i don't think you talked about the qualcomm thing did you oh god no we didn't
[01:52:56.320 --> 01:53:00.320]  talk about qualcomm yeah that was yeah there's the other big story i knew there was a big one
[01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:09.120]  yeah there we go now we have a a final act uh so what so qualcomm and apple were fighting
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:18.320]  for years uh big stakes apple started withholding billions of dollars in royalty fees basically
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:23.680]  i guess there's two sides of it where there are actually qualcomm chips
[01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:30.880]  and in the area of modems they are the clear leader worldwide and they charged for it accordingly
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:38.640]  and then there's the patent licensing which is patent licenses that qualcomm charges even if
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:46.640]  you weren't using their chips and apple seemingly took a deep moral outrage to this and felt that
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:52.000]  they were being charged for things they weren't paying for and that qualcomm didn't deserve
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:56.640]  didn't deserve and then there were other aspects of it at this part i learned and i'm glad i
[01:53:56.640 --> 01:54:02.800]  learned it so i didn't shoot my mouth off and have to do a follow-up um but i knew that the one way
[01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:07.760]  that qualcomm was charging for the license fees was based on the overall cost of the device
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:13.120]  so instead of saying okay this is a seven dollar part and you can put this seven dollar part in a
[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:17.840]  hundred dollar phone or in a five hundred dollar phone or a thousand dollar phone instead they
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:22.560]  would charge you based on what the price of the phone was for the price of the part and then so
[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:29.120]  apple because they they make more expensive phones was paying more for the same either chips or
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:32.800]  licensing fees that other company were and they saw this as deeply unfair and i always thought
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:37.280]  that was a little curious for apple to take an objection to because that's exactly how the app
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:45.840]  store works right isn't it a little rich for apple i have to agree with them that it doesn't
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:53.440]  really sound fair yeah uh but on the other hand you know if if a dollar app yeah that always used
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:57.120]  to that you used to work in the financial services industry and it used to drive me insane because
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:03.440]  we would get certain software products and a lot of the companies would charge you um not based
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:07.200]  on like the number of seats of you know users or whatever but they would charge you how much
[01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:12.640]  charge you for assets under management it's just like those are just numbers stored in the system
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:18.240]  the system like still does exactly the same thing whether you have a big number or a small number
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:26.400]  right and that's also the sort of thing where i i mean i enjoy having money i i i i'm trying to
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:32.080]  run a successful business i think i'm doing okay i believe in capitalism overall i don't want to go
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:37.440]  on a whole rant about that but but there is a part of me that has a sense of shame and so i
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:42.720]  a pricing scheme like that would never occur to me like my job is to come up with how do we charge
[01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:47.440]  mulch's company for our software how do you know because we want to make more money i might think
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:52.240]  of some ways to make more money you know like you know some kind of thing where if they have
[01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:56.720]  x number of seats they have to pay more or something uh it would never occur to me to
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:56:04.320]  charge by assets but it just wouldn't even occur but somebody thought of it and it worked and
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:09.920]  they're probably sitting on an island somewhere yeah they own right right but anyway apple
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:16.560]  objected to that and they were fighting uh and you know they were going to court and they even
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:20.480]  went to court they even had a full day in court yeah and then that was part of the interest that
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:26.080]  was one of the interesting parts of the story right because the the question was who who
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:33.200]  blinked and it seems like it was probably apple yeah um because it just it's the these things
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:40.320]  often do settle they sometimes do go to court but it's really unusual to go to court and start it
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:48.400]  and then settle right away uh and then later in the same day intel announced that they were
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:53.200]  getting out of the business of making 5g cellular modems for mobile devices
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:57:02.480]  and so you kind of see what the problem was here which is that if apple ever wants to have a 5g
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:07.040]  iphone or ipad and somebody made
[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:15.440]  remembered i did not that apple's first lte product was the ipad not the an iphone
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:23.200]  oh first five right first lte iphone the iphone the iphone 5 came out after the first uh lte capable
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:27.680]  ipad which actually makes a lot of sense at a technical level you think like hey the iphone's
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:31.360]  going to get it because that's the you know that's the favorite child that's the flagship product of
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:38.480]  the company but these new chipsets tend to be bigger and hotter and not as integrated onto a
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:43.920]  single tiny thing and the ipad is a lot bigger and has a much huger battery and therefore right
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:50.960]  at a simple basic technical level would be a lot easier to support lte or or coming soon 5g uh
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:59.280]  yeah yeah so it seems as though my theory i my take on the whole thing is that
[01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:07.040]  apple's plan a was to rely on intel for these chips going forward and you know like the last
[01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:12.320]  year like two years ago there were some iphones that had qualcomm modems and some that had intel
[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:17.200]  it's a very un-apple-like situation because the qualcomm ones were better they they were
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:21.760]  you know network engineers tested them and found that they were like 30 more efficient
[01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:25.840]  so they got like a stronger signal under more conditions and used less
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:30.720]  energy while doing so and it was all based on like which carriers you had around the world
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:36.400]  which as one of the articles i read said from somebody who obviously has sources that the
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:43.280]  carriers was like you know like i think at&t got the bad ones didn't really endear apple to at&t
[01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:51.840]  like intel or uh verizon had to get the good ones from qualcomm because qualcoms were the only ones
[01:58:51.840 --> 01:59:00.000]  that supported uh both cdma and whatever the opposite of gsm yeah you know so because verizon
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:05.360]  had the shittier cdma network they got the better iphones uh but then last year they went all intel
[01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:11.760]  it's intel across the board uh and that put and everybody who seems to know these things i i don't
[01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:16.880]  know jack about cellular modems i although i although i do know from reading all this that
[01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:23.840]  it is apparently devilishly tricky it is not surprising that one company like qualcomm has
[01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:30.400]  a big lead because it is apparently devilishly tricky and each jump up in networking you think
[01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:35.600]  like wow that's amazing it's so much faster but the ways that it works to get faster are
[01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:41.200]  incredibly tricky like the details of how 5g works it's it sounds insane um
[01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:48.480]  i guess their you know their plan was let's go to stick with intel so we can keep fighting qualcomm
[01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:55.280]  and i think that they were there were some reports that intel is was behind yeah uh like fast company
[01:59:55.280 --> 02:00:01.600]  had a good story apple obviously knew uh they weren't gonna be shipping 5g chips anytime right
[02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:08.400]  in the future right or at least not on apple's timetable whatever that timetable is uh so they
[02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:13.920]  had to settle but they you know how do you settle when you're between a rock and a hard place right
[02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:20.160]  like and it's you know the terms were not disclosed exactly you know but there's the
[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:26.320]  qualcomm did the closest they got to exposing the terms was qualcomm revealed what an increase in
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:31.440]  earnings per share they expected because of this and it was like two to three dollars earnings per
[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:35.840]  share per quarter or something like that and so somebody who could do the math on that figured out
[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:41.520]  you know uh you know act it was like you know seven or eight nine billion dollars a year or
[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:47.680]  whatever yeah i don't know what that number was um i don't know i don't have it's interesting
[02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:52.960]  because apple as they often do did seem to take a moral stance on this but it's hard not to also
[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:58.160]  think this was all about the money yeah yeah it had to be i mean well you i mean when you have
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:02.400]  one supplier though becomes it does become pretty difficult and they're probably paying a lot more
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:08.720]  than they right well if they were if there were like at least a couple players and right the other
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:15.280]  x factor is that apple is working on their own modems yeah right and apparently are years away
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:21.440]  but but but very very full steam ahead i would imagine and my understanding is they've set up
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:25.920]  their own like facility which is near qualcomm's and they're just like yeah they're trying to
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:31.760]  they're poaching as many qualcomm engineers as they can yeah yeah that's why they it's in san
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:40.400]  diego right yeah qualcomm town i still remember qualcomm is the padres park like qualcomm stadium
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:46.240]  i don't know it probably should probably uh uh i still remember qualcomm is the company that
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:58.480]  bought eudora oh yeah that was a bit ago in it and then wrecked it yeah um but that's a
[02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:05.360]  that's neither here no speaking of classic mac apps um yeah i don't know what else to say about
[02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:14.080]  it other than i think oh no they play at petco park okay that's at least a little fun that you
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:20.240]  know at least it conjures up fun images you know there everybody likes animals so do you know how
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:27.280]  bill you know how bill gates and his wife have bill and melinda gates have uh spent the last few
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:35.840]  few decades uh spending their enormous fortune on uh charitable endeavors around the world
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:41.360]  vaccinations and a lot of health care related stuff beaten beaten malaria i think they're
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:46.960]  getting kids glasses and stuff like that you know it's truly a noble use of of an enormous fortune
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:52.240]  i worry deeply that if i if i had like a bill gates enormous fortune i would waste it
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:58.720]  fixing the naming rights or stadium stadium no i don't know i what i would do is i would go back
[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:03.760]  i i wouldn't want to put my name on any of them i i would want to go to the white stocks and say
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:09.920]  i want to buy out guaranteed rate field and rename it commiskey park this i want this renamed
[02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:15.280]  commiskey park i would like to give them all good names not spiteful names because i'm not a fan of
[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:20.320]  their team i would just like i would like all of these ballparks to have a a nice name and
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:26.400]  you know uh hell we i might name i might have the mariners field named edgar martinez park there we
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:32.560]  go i don't know i mean something like that sure what a waste of a fortune god i wish i had a
[02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:37.280]  fortune to waste i would be so good at it oh and people would be so mad imagine how mad they would
[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:43.680]  be they found out i could have been could have been helping to beat malaria actually solving
[02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:50.400]  real problems but white socks fans would be happy i know no yeah i mean so some people would
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:56.160]  definitely be happy i'd never have to buy a drink in chicago again even even though i'd have this
[02:03:56.160 --> 02:04:00.880]  enormous margin of billions of dollars and could easily afford it yeah better spent just buying
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:09.120]  yourself some drinks and uh curing a disease uh i'd carry i knew we had one more major story i'm
[02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:13.680]  so glad that you remembered it i don't really have much to say about i guess the only other upside i
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:19.520]  can think of is that this may not be good for apple um it's or you know i don't have a lot of
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:24.080]  sympathy for him yeah i mean at least for now you know i mean i think that the competition now is
[02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:28.560]  going to be between apple and qualcum but um but it's going to take them like you said a few years
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:35.040]  i always i wonder what i haven't kept up on intel very much but it seemed like a number of like
[02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:39.200]  five or six years ago people were saying oh they're getting into ar they're getting into these chip
[02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:42.400]  these modem chips so you're going to be you know gangbusters because they're intel and they're so
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:48.160]  big and they can do anything and now they're like they're downsizing they're not successful
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:52.960]  they've i think they've dropped their ar stuff they've dropped them the 5g chips the modem chips
[02:04:53.760 --> 02:05:00.160]  it's a bit ignominious that they're it's like this is like totally this completes their any
[02:05:00.160 --> 02:05:05.680]  attempt at getting into the mobile game yeah it is kind of ignominious given how what an
[02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:12.800]  ass-kicking company they were in the pc era uh and how just and it's just hard to overstate how
[02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:19.200]  dominant they they were and you know along with microsoft but microsoft is still doing their thing
[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:24.240]  yeah microsoft just later turned it around to a large degree right right the the you know
[02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:31.840]  satila satya nadella has as really turned this you know turned that company around and they are
[02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:37.360]  you know doing different things but doing well but man oh man it's very it seems very painfully
[02:05:37.360 --> 02:05:42.720]  obvious that intel should have in some sense of the word should should have been a killer company
[02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:50.320]  in mobile chips yeah and they can't even make a modem i know and i know i just got done i
[02:05:50.320 --> 02:05:53.920]  that's so unfair because i just got done saying how devilishly tricky the whole thing
[02:05:55.680 --> 02:06:00.000]  but that's what they did they did make some modems but they just didn't do well enough to make it a
[02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:08.640]  good business no uh it does fit with the cook doctrine which i think is interesting i i i always
[02:06:08.640 --> 02:06:13.040]  link to horace dead use summary of it and it's some statement of like a sort of mission statement
[02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:18.400]  that tim cook gave i don't know if it when it was first became ci and then it was like
[02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:23.840]  i don't know if it when it was first became ceo or maybe he was still coo and it's longer it
[02:06:23.840 --> 02:06:28.400]  actually espouses more than this but the part that always sticks with me that one of the things apple
[02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:33.280]  does according to cook's doctrine is owning and controlling the primary technologies behind the
[02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:40.080]  products that apple makes and i think they obviously miscalculated on these cellular
[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:47.520]  modems years ago and and and on the on the flip side one of the least heralded but i think
[02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:54.320]  the most astounding strategic successes in the history of the industry let alone just apple
[02:06:54.320 --> 02:06:58.960]  was their decision to get into the mobile chip game with that what was the company they bought
[02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:07.920]  i can't remember just it was a small investment overall and uh you know turned it into these a
[02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:13.040]  series processors and i just i still remember the the keynote where they announced i think it was
[02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:20.640]  a4 was the first one and that that was their design and the pride that steve jobs had in it
[02:07:20.640 --> 02:07:27.200]  was so palpable it was like i just remember thinking like from just listening to the way
[02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:32.000]  he announced it that this really wasn't about this a4 chip this is about like apple's future
[02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:36.400]  like it was a very big deal to him and in hindsight it it truly is
[02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:42.880]  you know i think they might have miscalculated on when they should have gotten into the
[02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:48.640]  cellular mode because it may be miscalculated at how what a stranglehold one company qualcomm
[02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:56.640]  was going to have over it yeah well ideally they will have they will have set themselves up a
[02:07:56.640 --> 02:08:01.760]  little bit better sometime down the road the upside for us as users is we'll get better
[02:08:01.760 --> 02:08:07.200]  modems because the qualcomm ones are better and i hopefully we'll get you know maybe we'll get 5g
[02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:12.080]  phones better i don't really care i don't i have to say well it's not all rolled out yet and right
[02:08:12.080 --> 02:08:16.400]  and it's not even there's a whole bunch of infrastructure even like yeah i mean there's
[02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:22.800]  so much that needs to be done in order for it to be truly meaningful that right right there's
[02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:29.840]  thinking that it's going to come in 2020 maybe but it may not come until 2021 but yeah it's
[02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:34.880]  probably not going to be that big a deal well and yeah and the other thing is i have to say my lte
[02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:40.240]  service is excellent most places i go like i can't think of i'm trying to think of things i do where
[02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:48.160]  having something even faster would be better uh i you know i it's pretty pretty hard to come up
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:53.280]  with anything like i stream video at the highest resolution i want i mean i guess there's coverage
[02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:59.520]  is a little bit more of an issue than than speed really right and penetrating into like basements
[02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:03.920]  or thick buildings and it seems it sounds to me like 5g has a lot of problems in that area
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:11.040]  but we shall see but it'll you know at the very least it's better modems for for iphone users
[02:09:12.240 --> 02:09:16.960]  uh john i thank you thank you uh i guess there was one more thing here we have one more thing
[02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:20.560]  one more thing we could do it quickly you just said before i thank god i forgot this i didn't
[02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:28.400]  forget it you still use an iphone se uh yes and there was a rumor recently separately from gear
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:33.760]  rambo it's this at apple yeah go ahead is going to do they're going to do a new iphone 8 with updated
[02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:40.160]  internals yeah so like like like the mariners we started with the mariners in my not setting my
[02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:47.280]  heart on their early good performance um when we can close on on me not getting my heart set on
[02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:53.040]  rumors of a smaller phone i will believe it when i see it i hope that they make a smaller phone
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:59.120]  um even if it is i would still rather it'd be smaller than the eight form factor right right
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:04.800]  because the se is is much more the sweet spot sweet spot for me and particularly i just had my
[02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:10.160]  um my vision checked and my my prescription changed and now i can i can read things better
[02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:16.880]  uh because i'm at the age i'm so old now that my my near-sightedness is correcting itself and so
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:22.560]  yes my prescription was overcompensating and so yeah dial me back down and now i can yeah now i
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:28.000]  can read text better and so now my my se is you know i don't have to pump up the text and it's
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:35.920]  not like getting like four words on the front of it um so uh i i'm back all in on on small phones
[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:44.080]  it it sounds right to me that the if they were gonna do another se type thing that doing it in
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:51.280]  the iphone 8 size factor sounds about right even though i know for the those like you and my friend
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:57.520]  mike davidson who's a huge aficionado of that smaller size and really really it's just bitching
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:02.800]  to me the other day about his iphone 10s being too goddamn big yeah i know that you would rather
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:07.200]  have it be smaller but the 8 is definitely i just picked it off my desk when the rumor hit it it
[02:11:07.200 --> 02:11:12.720]  feels smaller and most importantly lighter it is a lot lighter right than than the 10s yeah and i
[02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:18.160]  lived with i mean i had a 6 and then a 6s so i lived with that form factor for like a year and
[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:24.800]  a half before you know before the se came out um before you hit the jackpot right the temporary
[02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:31.280]  jackpot which i've all i've spent all of i have this phone this phone is now three years old
[02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:36.320]  that's amazing which is the first i mean it's definitely the first iphone that i've used for
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:42.960]  that one yeah it's in good shape you take yeah oh yeah it's in a case of course because i you know
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:47.920]  because i this thing i'm not not risking and i think we finally reached the point where we're
[02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:56.480]  we're good we're running out of uh of um clearance ones yeah you can't afford to have it pretty soon
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:11:59.840]  like unless i want to get a rose gold one i better i better take good care of it
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:02.880]  it's like my my collection of apple extended keyboard
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:07.120]  now i know how you live
[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:14.560]  i when i when my second one broke my my first one lasted for so long and my second one which
[02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:22.240]  was used to start broke and i suspect was never taken as good a care of before i started using it
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:27.360]  so when i and and then the one i'm on now was literally new in box when i started using it
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:31.200]  and my one of my rules is no games i'm not allowed to play games on my imac because
[02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:35.520]  press too hard on those keys this thing this baby's got to last me for a long time
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:39.920]  you need a second gaming keyboard all right yeah
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:44.560]  anyway john moltz i thank you very much uh you got a bunch of other podcasts but you've got
