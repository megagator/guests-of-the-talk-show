[00:00.000 --> 00:05.600]  It's a very special week for you. You're now on the on the door for both Google and Microsoft
[00:08.480 --> 00:12.160]  Very cool. It was led by the time this episode airs that'll have been last week
[00:12.880 --> 00:14.880]  Lao last week
[00:14.880 --> 00:19.360]  Cool. We're in the future then also. Yeah. Thanks to Facebook for sponsoring this week
[00:19.680 --> 00:25.600]  Dan is referring to last week steering fireball or assess feed sponsor, which was Google who took the spot to
[00:25.600 --> 00:34.080]  Advertise job openings for their iOS apps, which I think is actually a fantastic sponsorship. I think that
[00:35.040 --> 00:39.440]  I think that the I hope they do well. I hope they get some good care if they get one good candidate out of it
[00:39.440 --> 00:40.960]  They'll be delighted
[00:40.960 --> 00:46.160]  Yeah, it's actually really smart, and I'm actually surprised more companies haven't been looking to do
[00:46.160 --> 00:50.600]  I mean, you know, there are job boards like there's that one that a lot of the sites use
[00:50.600 --> 00:58.280]  But companies like Google and Apple too and and all the big tech companies spend so much money on recruiting
[00:58.280 --> 01:02.360]  It's not even funny, so and it's more and more because it's really a
[01:03.720 --> 01:07.720]  They all had all say that it's the biggest the one of the biggest problems they have right now. Oh
[01:08.120 --> 01:12.760]  Totally especially engineers. I mean, they're willing to buy them for like a million dollars each in these equi hires
[01:12.760 --> 01:14.760]  so surely a few
[01:14.760 --> 01:20.600]  Blog sponsorships here and there are good investment. Yeah, but actually it inspired me to
[01:21.160 --> 01:24.200]  Get out my old the only Android device in my house
[01:25.480 --> 01:31.240]  Which I've actually never used until today was it's a Nexus 7 that that I don't even know how we got it
[01:31.240 --> 01:34.760]  but so long had passed between receiving it and
[01:35.880 --> 01:38.040]  Trying to use it that it had actually been bricked
[01:38.040 --> 01:44.680]  Like I I plugged it in for a month and it still didn't charge at all
[01:45.560 --> 01:51.000]  And then today randomly I'm like throwing stuff out and I was like, oh, I should just throw out this stupid
[01:51.400 --> 01:55.720]  Nexus 7 that never worked and I plugged it in and started charging so
[01:56.680 --> 02:03.000]  Who's the same? I've spent the last six hours doing software updates on it and now it's ready to go
[02:03.000 --> 02:13.800]  So I'll get to experience the joy of Android 4.4. I don't know. Yeah, I think the Nexus 7 is the current seven inch tablet
[02:13.800 --> 02:14.760]  Isn't it?
[02:14.760 --> 02:19.720]  Well, this one is definitely not because it doesn't I don't think it runs the
[02:20.360 --> 02:22.360]  What is it kit cat or something?
[02:22.360 --> 02:30.680]  This is definitely a few few years old now, so maybe there's a new Nexus 7, but this is like the first generation
[02:33.080 --> 02:37.000]  But cool we can good stuff we can quibble about or talk about
[02:37.400 --> 02:43.960]  Probably make a whole show about what the names of these devices are and the problems of the way that some of the some of them are named
[02:44.520 --> 02:46.360]  Apple you know right up there with them
[02:47.240 --> 02:49.720]  Like with the way that they've switched to calling iPad
[02:49.720 --> 02:53.640]  You know at one point. They just called it iPad now. It's just iPad Air and iPad mini
[02:54.840 --> 02:58.600]  The new iPad right the new iPad for a while
[02:59.240 --> 03:00.440]  Yeah
[03:00.440 --> 03:06.760]  With Google it seemed like with the Nexus they started naming them after their sizes like the Nexus 5 is a five inch
[03:06.840 --> 03:14.280]  Phone and the Nexus 7 is a seven inch tablet which is kind of cool while they're new but then gets confusing
[03:15.480 --> 03:17.480]  You know if they come out with a
[03:17.480 --> 03:22.360]  The new one like that it says right here. I'm at the Google site and it says Google Nexus 7
[03:22.920 --> 03:24.760]  So I presume there've been more than one
[03:25.960 --> 03:28.520]  Tablet with the name Google Nexus 7
[03:29.240 --> 03:31.240]  like
[03:31.240 --> 03:33.800]  I have no idea but and it's funny because
[03:34.440 --> 03:35.800]  Samsung
[03:35.800 --> 03:42.840]  Does that with their tablets? They do the size but then with the phones. They do like the galaxy s5
[03:42.840 --> 03:48.200]  Goes in order of number of releases like the iPhone. So right
[03:50.600 --> 03:54.600]  So I wonder how wonderful see the end. I wonder you know like for example
[03:54.600 --> 03:59.880]  Will there will there will there be a new phone that you're called the iPhone 6 or are they finally gonna split to you know
[04:00.200 --> 04:02.200]  Yeah, I was just gonna ask you that too because
[04:02.760 --> 04:09.000]  The what is it patchkowski report on was a Friday that that the or sometime this week
[04:09.000 --> 04:16.280]  All right, well now it's two weeks ago. What yeah, all right this month this month sometime in August
[04:16.680 --> 04:20.520]  The report that that September is gonna be the iPhone event
[04:21.080 --> 04:23.720]  But no, you know doesn't say iPhone 6
[04:25.400 --> 04:29.800]  Yeah, he would know however however he get and his stuff on the vents is gold
[04:29.800 --> 04:33.560]  I don't think he's ever had a bad report. No, I don't think so
[04:33.560 --> 04:39.560]  Um, but wherever that would be we'll get to that in a second right wherever that wherever that comes from though
[04:39.560 --> 04:45.560]  I mean presumably I always presume that he's got somebody in Apple PR who who gives him that stuff but
[04:47.560 --> 04:52.120]  Whoever it is my guest to but I have no idea whoever it is isn't gonna give him the name of the products
[04:52.520 --> 04:55.080]  I don't think they ever deliberately leak a name
[04:56.120 --> 04:58.680]  They put the data out there just to sort of you know
[04:58.680 --> 05:03.320]  Yeah, I want that out there is sort of a you know, let everybody know what's coming
[05:03.960 --> 05:10.200]  Without actually committing to it right they could back out of the last second and patchkowski looks bad, but but the Apple doesn't
[05:11.400 --> 05:13.400]  Yeah, I wouldn't give the name
[05:14.280 --> 05:20.760]  I guess it seems weird now, but remember like even the day of the iPad launched no one really knew it was gonna be called
[05:20.760 --> 05:28.360]  Like people were doubting that it would be called the iPad. Nope. Yeah, I totally remember that was I think that was one of the names that had been thrown out there
[05:28.360 --> 05:35.560]  Because of what it like a domain registration or something like well, and I think some people came up with that naturally just because of iPod
[05:36.120 --> 05:44.080]  Oh, yeah, and and pad seems like a natural thing for a pad size device and everybody immediately
[05:44.080 --> 05:48.480]  Dismissed it as sounding like a tampon or something like a family. What was your name?
[05:48.480 --> 05:50.880]  It was the the slate or something no
[05:50.880 --> 05:58.400]  Oh, I actually glass no, I forget what I suggested it wasn't iPad though. It wasn't glass. No, it wasn't glass
[05:59.120 --> 06:03.840]  Huh a forgot I tab did I suggest item? No, no, I don't think you had an eye
[06:04.720 --> 06:10.720]  Yeah, I'm kind of sick of the eyes. Yeah, that's uh, I don't remember although the I actually makes more sense
[06:11.360 --> 06:16.680]  For these things then because I stood for internet right like that was the I Mac was the internet man
[06:16.680 --> 06:22.760]  Supposedly, I mean, that's how it was introduced with the iMac is that it was the first Mac built for the internet age
[06:22.760 --> 06:26.320]  And I think that the iMac was the first eye product
[06:27.400 --> 06:30.080]  Right it was you know, but then again
[06:30.080 --> 06:31.760]  They say it was made for internet
[06:31.760 --> 06:38.680]  But then the one that really cemented the deal and was a decade long foundation of the company the iPod
[06:39.160 --> 06:44.440]  Didn't get internet access until the iPod touch right had nothing to do with the internet
[06:44.440 --> 06:48.840]  Exactly, but then it the iPhone if it's perfectly because
[06:49.960 --> 06:56.920]  That was like the first phone that actually did the internet better than it did the phone. Yeah, I think I think what's happened though
[06:56.920 --> 07:01.920]  I think it's never explained never talked about but like the undercurrent is that
[07:03.120 --> 07:05.120]  lowercase i
[07:05.120 --> 07:09.400]  Capital product name just means Apple product
[07:09.400 --> 07:15.680]  That's it. Yeah, it doesn't really have any other connotation other than that just means Apple product
[07:16.440 --> 07:19.680]  Right like everyone and everyone calls it the I touch still
[07:20.960 --> 07:26.280]  Which yeah, maybe that's what I suggested the iPad maybe I found an old post
[07:26.280 --> 07:30.640]  But I am not gonna read it while I'm talking to you. That's rude. Oh, you could we could edit it out
[07:30.640 --> 07:36.920]  I don't even know it says it's called the tablet. Yeah, that's the piece that December 31st
[07:36.920 --> 07:40.040]  2000 not yeah, yeah, I don't know if I suggested here's a post
[07:40.600 --> 07:46.840]  Well, you say I want to know what Apple refers to it as the tablet, but so far as I can tell that's blah blah
[07:47.480 --> 07:49.480]  Most certainly not the name right
[07:50.920 --> 07:57.200]  I had room I had predicted it would be the iPod touch HD which was you know not
[07:57.840 --> 08:02.600]  Ultimately not it's kind of what it is, but that's that ultimately not obviously what they called it
[08:02.600 --> 08:06.200]  I don't I don't know what you're
[08:07.920 --> 08:09.920]  All right, whatever doesn't matter
[08:10.320 --> 08:14.560]  But speaking of those event dates something weird happened
[08:15.120 --> 08:17.120]  this past week where
[08:17.560 --> 08:22.000]  You like made it out you made a typical John Gruber offhand comment
[08:22.440 --> 08:25.840]  You know seemingly knowing comment about some sort of
[08:25.840 --> 08:35.640]  Risk device coming next month. Well, I was cracking a joke about the Motorola the Moto 270 watch. Yeah, and how stupid it looks on the side
[08:35.640 --> 08:37.240]  285 I
[08:37.240 --> 08:42.640]  Think we measured and it was 270. Oh, okay. I go with 270. I like that sounds good
[08:42.640 --> 08:49.560]  And you know that the bottom of the circle is cut off, but it charges on its side and so when you're charging it
[08:49.560 --> 08:52.640]  it's like the in watch terms the
[08:52.640 --> 08:57.280]  Like eight nine and ten o'clock side is
[08:58.120 --> 09:04.240]  Cut off, but for some inexplicable reason even though they cut off that part of the circular display
[09:04.520 --> 09:09.800]  They decide to show the charge as as a circular meter around the perimeter
[09:09.840 --> 09:16.640]  Which which means that's you know somewhere between like 70 when you're in between 70 and 90 percent you have no idea
[09:17.560 --> 09:20.480]  Whether you're close to 70 or 90 they just cut it off
[09:20.480 --> 09:28.040]  And they're shipping it. They're gonna ship that product. So I was cracking a joke about that and I said I should actually quote it because
[09:28.880 --> 09:32.040]  I guess it's the exact language I chose which is unfortunate
[09:33.080 --> 09:40.440]  I wrote the only way this could get funnier would be if it doesn't even ship until after Apple announces their wrist wearable thing next month
[09:40.440 --> 09:44.000]  And then I'm this now this is a backstory on this is it's true
[09:44.000 --> 09:48.760]  You know my description of the talk show is the director's commentary on their fireball
[09:48.760 --> 09:55.360]  So here we are I posted that this is that was Friday and
[09:56.000 --> 10:02.560]  That we my family and I were in Orlando, Florida after for a week or so of theme park fun
[10:04.160 --> 10:09.000]  On I think I was on my way to the airport. I don't know either on my way to the airport or at the airport when I posted that
[10:10.000 --> 10:15.520]  And what was your intent you were just goofing around? Well, I wanted to see me like if
[10:15.520 --> 10:21.080]  If the the watch the wrist thing comes out at next month's event
[10:21.080 --> 10:26.080]  It would be funny if because but motor motor oil is promises that it's going to ship in this summer
[10:26.080 --> 10:28.120]  Which gives them to like September 21st?
[10:28.960 --> 10:32.880]  And they haven't announced it yet and I think it's gonna look really really bad
[10:33.640 --> 10:40.000]  As soon as Apple unveils whatever it is that they're working on and I think it's almost certain at this point that Apple is
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.800]  Working on something and it's almost certain that it's going to be announced this year and if it is announced this year
[10:44.800 --> 10:49.960]  It'll almost certainly been asked either in September or October
[10:49.960 --> 10:54.840]  I don't know what right and then adding to this was that I don't know if it was published
[10:55.520 --> 10:59.520]  shortly before your post or shortly after but patch koski
[11:00.280 --> 11:01.880]  posted
[11:01.880 --> 11:08.640]  You know sort of citing sources whatever that it's gonna happen in October period
[11:08.640 --> 11:15.360]  The wearable thing. Yeah. Oh, I didn't know that. I thought he posted that back in June. He updated that. I don't know
[11:15.360 --> 11:18.320]  I don't let me look I thought he posted that like June 6th
[11:18.760 --> 11:23.480]  That it that they were shooting for an october date. Oh, maybe that was an old article
[11:23.480 --> 11:27.280]  But someone I am did to me and they're like who's your money on Gruber or
[11:27.760 --> 11:32.400]  Or patch well my money would be on patch koski people seem to think I'm I'm
[11:32.880 --> 11:38.160]  more prescient than then than I am and I know I do know that I have a terrible
[11:38.160 --> 11:41.720]  Terrible guilty habit. I should be I should be guilty about it, but I'm not of
[11:42.880 --> 11:49.280]  When I do have information coily putting it out there without a source as as though it's my own speculation
[11:50.960 --> 11:55.600]  Oh, man, this is from June 6th. Yeah, it's from June. I got punk. I got punk and played
[11:56.240 --> 12:00.920]  I thought it was I thought it was published like at the same time as your right well and if you read it
[12:00.920 --> 12:02.920]  He didn't say
[12:02.920 --> 12:06.680]  Apple is going to announce it in October his June 6th thing said
[12:06.680 --> 12:10.560]  Apple is shooting for october to release it, you know meaning
[12:11.480 --> 12:12.680]  You know
[12:12.680 --> 12:17.600]  Who you know well it was June I mean they still had a lot of work. Whatever it is that they're that they're working on June means
[12:17.600 --> 12:19.600]  They still had a lot of work left to do on it
[12:19.600 --> 12:23.560]  Right and and and like in the last several years
[12:23.560 --> 12:27.520]  They've had basically the September event and the October event and
[12:28.040 --> 12:32.800]  You know right if if it's not ready for September you can do it in October
[12:32.800 --> 12:38.440]  But if it is ready, and if it's you know, this is the kind of thing that is being pitched as an iPhone accessory
[12:38.440 --> 12:43.440]  Basically, then why not show it off in September? I don't know but well anyway
[12:43.440 --> 12:45.080]  Read this if you read the sentence that I wrote
[12:45.080 --> 12:48.880]  I wrote the only way this could get funnier would be if it doesn't even ship until
[12:50.000 --> 12:55.520]  After Apple announces the wrist wearable thing next month, and I when I wrote that I even thought I
[12:55.520 --> 13:02.080]  I should probably put something if they announced it in September instead of October or something like something like that. Yeah
[13:04.400 --> 13:11.400]  But it's anything like that takes the piss and vinegar out of the joke and I didn't write when Apple announces their
[13:11.960 --> 13:15.920]  Risk wearable thing next month because if that was the clause I was thinking about writing
[13:15.920 --> 13:17.920]  I would have used if instead of when
[13:18.240 --> 13:20.640]  If Apple announces the risk wearable thing next month
[13:20.640 --> 13:25.960]  So and the whole thing is also further complicated that I was doing it from my phone, which makes me lazy
[13:25.960 --> 13:30.880]  It does it it makes me lazier to rewrite a sentence whereas if I was at my desk
[13:30.880 --> 13:38.200]  I might you know, I did notice that I noticed that someone could read that as me saying that they're definitely going to do in September
[13:38.200 --> 13:41.680]  And I thought nah, no one will do that everybody knows I'm making a joke about the Moto 360
[13:41.680 --> 13:49.800]  It's like a two and a half hour flight from Orlando back to Philly, and it happened to be a plane with no
[13:50.560 --> 13:51.800]  Wi-Fi
[13:51.800 --> 13:55.200]  So I had no idea I had no Wi-Fi. There was a hashtag John
[13:55.200 --> 13:57.200]  It was has Gruber landed
[13:57.200 --> 14:05.040]  And I get off and it had gone like bananas. It was like top-of-tech meme John Gruber confirms I watch is gonna be
[14:05.040 --> 14:13.080]  Released in September, and I was like no, I didn't and I know more friday's man, right?
[14:13.080 --> 14:17.040]  And then you know it's like 10 o'clock on a Friday and I'm I guess I should
[14:17.520 --> 14:21.880]  Update it and I thought now fuck that. I'm not gonna update it because I didn't say that I don't
[14:22.600 --> 14:26.240]  Let the other people look foolish for reading too much into it. Yeah
[14:26.240 --> 14:34.240]  And there's too much it was like too much to update because I do think I'm certain that they're planning to
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  Announce it either in September or October
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.440]  I don't know that they will anything can happen at the last minute
[14:40.680 --> 14:46.360]  But I think that they'll have two events just be it mainland. This is one thing I often
[14:47.120 --> 14:52.240]  Forget is even people who like read my stuff, you know listen to the I don't know
[14:52.240 --> 14:56.640]  Maybe people listen to the show or more tindim, but there's so many people who read there in Fireball
[14:58.040 --> 15:06.120]  And followed tech period, but who don't seem to pick up on the very to me very obvious patterns of Apple as a company
[15:06.120 --> 15:09.120]  That you know, I say this or a lot of I repeat myself on this
[15:09.120 --> 15:13.200]  But they're a company of annual patterns and they do break them sometimes, you know
[15:13.200 --> 15:16.720]  The iPhone used to be a thing the first few years that came out in June
[15:16.720 --> 15:25.640]  Or early July very early July and then it switched to becoming like a late September thing or announced in early September
[15:26.040 --> 15:28.040]  release two weeks later and
[15:28.040 --> 15:33.600]  Once they switched that that they stuck to that and they've stuck to it ever since and last few years
[15:33.600 --> 15:43.200]  They've had a September event with the iPhone and an October event with the iPad and I just assume that they're probably stick to that this year
[15:43.200 --> 15:47.920]  And therefore that they've got two events one of the and if they're gonna do the wearable thing
[15:48.160 --> 15:52.400]  They'll have to pick one of those two events to to you know included on
[15:53.280 --> 15:57.000]  So I you know, I don't have anybody who's told me that I don't know nobody told me
[15:57.000 --> 15:58.560]  I'm just you know working it out myself
[15:58.560 --> 16:01.040]  I do think it's very in some ways it makes sense
[16:01.280 --> 16:06.120]  Because the other thing too is it's not just that they have to pick one of the two events and find time for it
[16:06.120 --> 16:09.760]  But their events typically have like a narrative that runs through them
[16:09.760 --> 16:14.880]  And if they're announcing more than one thing they figure out some kind of way to tie it together in
[16:15.480 --> 16:21.800]  The show as part of like one story and I kind of feel like like a wearable wrist thing
[16:22.960 --> 16:27.200]  Sounds to me like something that'd be easier to tie in with new iPhones than with the iPad
[16:27.800 --> 16:31.440]  Yes, especially if it requires an iPhone to be
[16:32.080 --> 16:36.240]  Used right well we can talk about that later because that's a question
[16:36.240 --> 16:44.600]  But I do think though that even if or at least if it goes best with it. Yeah, and there others if it's an accessory if it's a two hundred dollar iPhone accessory
[16:45.600 --> 16:52.520]  You know show it off with the iPhone right and the the the the new iPads last year came with the M7 co-processor
[16:52.520 --> 17:01.040]  Two, but it certainly makes a lot more sense that that if the storyline is about health and fitness tracking right the health kit sort of
[17:01.040 --> 17:08.560]  You know going health kit expanding from a little 90-second spot during WWDC to here's why we're doing this
[17:08.560 --> 17:14.440]  You know 90-minute presentation on on health and fitness tracking with a bunch of partners, et cetera
[17:15.280 --> 17:22.600]  It seems to me like that would fit more naturally with the iPhone and new iPhones that also have or I guess maybe have an M8
[17:23.160 --> 17:25.160]  fitness, you know activity tracker
[17:25.160 --> 17:33.920]  Then with the iPad which you know, it's I feel like they included the M7 on the iPad because why not at probably not a very expensive
[17:33.920 --> 17:39.840]  Component, but I don't think tracking your feet based on your iPad is going to give you you know your footsteps is gonna
[17:39.840 --> 17:41.840]  Give you a very accurate count
[17:42.120 --> 17:43.040]  Right, yeah
[17:43.040 --> 17:50.720]  I mean if it and if it needs any sort of Bluetooth connection to a device to sync to the you know to your cloud kit
[17:50.720 --> 17:53.560]  Right or cloud whatever your iCloud account is
[17:53.560 --> 17:59.680]  That's most likely going to be an iPhone and not an iPad. Yeah, but it probably could technically be an iPad
[17:59.680 --> 18:05.360]  but my guess is that the majority of people will sync with an iPhone right and further
[18:05.600 --> 18:11.400]  Complicating this is Yosemite and not complicating it. I would say almost clarifying it is Yosemite which
[18:12.000 --> 18:16.720]  Last year the Mac OS 10 update shipped in October not September
[18:16.720 --> 18:25.560]  And I think the year before right or maybe not. I don't know. Yeah, I know last year did and I know this year
[18:25.560 --> 18:32.600]  It seems to be tracking behind iOS and mark german of nine to five Mac said it was an oct it was gonna come in October
[18:32.600 --> 18:34.600]  Which it's makes a lot of sense
[18:37.360 --> 18:39.360]  And it just doesn't make sense to
[18:40.280 --> 18:45.160]  Assuming, you know, it also even if it were ready. It just doesn't make sense as part of the iPhone
[18:45.160 --> 18:52.440]  Event, whereas it makes more sense as the iPad event because iPads and Macs are a little bit more similar overlapping
[18:53.240 --> 19:01.120]  And so if they're going to do a and that's what they've done in the past few years is sort of repeat the Yosemite thing from
[19:01.480 --> 19:07.960]  WWDC, you know, like here's these 10 features we think you really want to know about in Yosemite and you know for some of us
[19:07.960 --> 19:12.600]  Who pay close attention and remembered the WWDC keynote clearly it's a little bit of a repeat
[19:12.600 --> 19:17.960]  But for people who haven't been paying close attention, which is you know part of the whole message
[19:17.960 --> 19:21.800]  You know whole point of marketing is you know to repeat your message to get it through
[19:23.040 --> 19:27.400]  That's what they do, but I presume that's gonna take up a big chunk of the October event
[19:28.440 --> 19:36.880]  Especially if there's a 12 inch paper thin MacBook Air retina ready to go to yeah, but I don't there runs an AA chip nods
[19:36.880 --> 19:43.120]  I'm gonna have yeah, which I don't expect all right. So I found a post on business insider that says
[19:43.920 --> 19:51.240]  quote Canvas a perfect name for Apple tablets says Apple God John Gruber. I wonder who may have written that post
[19:52.280 --> 19:54.280]  Oh, that was me
[19:56.280 --> 20:01.200]  Anyway, yeah Canvas that was the that's that's in hindsight. That sounds stupid
[20:02.080 --> 20:04.080]  That's why they don't let me name things
[20:04.080 --> 20:09.380]  But but I pad sound it's stupid too. Yeah. Yeah, maybe it's called it Canvas
[20:10.400 --> 20:11.920]  Well, I don't know I
[20:11.920 --> 20:14.840]  Guess the one thing one thing about iPad in hindsight is
[20:15.960 --> 20:19.600]  It somehow makes it feel like a sibling to iPhone
[20:20.600 --> 20:27.480]  In a way that if they'd called it the one thing iPhone and the other thing Canvas that they wouldn't seem like there is aligned
[20:28.320 --> 20:33.440]  Yeah, and especially you know with the notion that they're gonna rename iPhone OS to
[20:33.440 --> 20:34.680]  iOS
[20:34.680 --> 20:39.400]  Which I think was was that before that no was after app because it would have been a giveaway before
[20:40.320 --> 20:42.920]  Well the iPod touch, but yeah, oh
[20:44.440 --> 20:49.320]  Yeah, but they still called it. I they never seemed to hesitate to to
[20:51.320 --> 20:56.520]  To make it clear that the iPod touch despite its name was an iPhone without a phone
[20:57.360 --> 21:01.120]  Yeah, iPhone OS for a name renamed iOS for
[21:01.120 --> 21:03.120]  2010
[21:03.640 --> 21:04.640]  All right
[21:04.640 --> 21:10.360]  So yeah, I go that's truly I mean and circling back to what you said of you know back 10 minutes ago
[21:10.360 --> 21:14.920]  You know, it's true that nobody nope not only do people not know the name of
[21:15.520 --> 21:20.160]  The first iPad in 2010 nobody even really knew
[21:20.880 --> 21:25.920]  There was no confirmation no leaks that it ran iPhone. What was then called iPhone OS
[21:25.920 --> 21:30.040]  Like I it's in a footnote on my piece the tablet
[21:31.640 --> 21:38.560]  Where I wrote I would not be surprised to find out that the tablet uses UI kit AKA Coco touch as its programming API
[21:38.880 --> 21:42.800]  Like I kind of thought it would because it seemed to make sense to me, but no, I didn't nobody knew
[21:43.200 --> 21:45.800]  There weren't any kind of leaked nothing leaked out of them
[21:46.840 --> 21:50.120]  My favorite was an article I think from Nick built in
[21:50.120 --> 21:52.120]  Uh
[21:54.680 --> 21:56.680]  Where he said that
[21:57.640 --> 22:00.280]  The tablet interface would surprise you
[22:01.560 --> 22:07.720]  It was basically like get ready for a big surprise about you will be very surprised by how you
[22:08.600 --> 22:10.600]  Interact with a new tablet
[22:10.600 --> 22:16.960]  I don't know just like I don't know who told him that that doesn't seem. Yeah, I don't know doesn't see my illustration was was a
[22:16.960 --> 22:20.400]  A woman with a with a crazy brain helmet on like a
[22:21.360 --> 22:23.360]  Brain measurement helmet that
[22:24.160 --> 22:29.240]  That would have been a very apt description for the original iPhone, but yeah, it's not you know
[22:29.240 --> 22:35.240]  It was in fact. I guess it's really could really say it's wrong given how many people came out of the iPad intro with I
[22:35.680 --> 22:38.480]  Can't believe we got all excited for that. It's just a big iPhone
[22:40.080 --> 22:42.480]  Exactly, yeah, and and actually did a roundup
[22:43.200 --> 22:45.200]  before the iPad was announced of
[22:45.200 --> 22:48.640]  kind of artist renderings of what it might look like and
[22:50.960 --> 22:57.040]  There's actually one that looks exactly like the current iPad mini by
[22:58.000 --> 23:04.160]  Hey Zeus Diaz of Gizmodo. Oh, yeah, it looks exactly like today's iPad mini
[23:04.960 --> 23:06.000]  I
[23:06.000 --> 23:11.920]  Did not look like the first op iPad, but it was kind of funny so I so some of those renderings of
[23:11.920 --> 23:16.880]  Of whatever I watch is going to be called might be
[23:18.240 --> 23:25.080]  Somewhat accurate someday in the future, but I don't know. Yeah, I do wonder about that. I do have I heard one thing
[23:25.080 --> 23:29.560]  Well, you know what let me take a break about for school answer and and we'll get back to it
[23:30.800 --> 23:34.520]  And let me tell you about our good friends at backplays
[23:35.200 --> 23:38.400]  You guys know backplays. They are online backup
[23:38.400 --> 23:41.800]  Unlimited unthrottle for your Mac
[23:42.800 --> 23:44.400]  computer
[23:44.400 --> 23:51.120]  You sign up for backplays you install their software, which was written by ex Apple engineers totally cool very nice native
[23:51.120 --> 23:54.440]  Mac software little thing and system preferences set it up
[23:54.960 --> 24:00.880]  It stays out of your way just runs in the background and then everything on your Mac even external drives
[24:00.880 --> 24:06.520]  You have plugged in just backs up to backblazes online hosted
[24:06.520 --> 24:08.280]  Servers
[24:08.280 --> 24:10.280]  Takes a while for the first backup
[24:10.680 --> 24:16.200]  Especially depending on your upstream thing. There's no no getting around that might take a while might take a couple days
[24:16.200 --> 24:20.760]  Maybe even a week depending on how much stuff you have to get that up there after that everything's incremental
[24:21.320 --> 24:23.320]  Just stays backed up
[24:23.480 --> 24:25.040]  then
[24:25.040 --> 24:30.280]  You can do whatever you want you can restore one file at a time you can restore all your files
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.840]  disaster strikes or you're across the country, but need your whole system
[24:34.840 --> 24:40.840]  You don't want to do you can get them to put your whole backup on an external drive
[24:40.840 --> 24:45.040]  You have to pay for it, but then they'll ship it right to you get it all right back in your hands right away
[24:45.640 --> 24:50.440]  They have iPhone app so you can access and share any of your files from wherever you are
[24:51.080 --> 24:52.600]  You don't have to
[24:52.600 --> 24:57.480]  Tunnel through anything to get to your own Mac your Mac could be sleeping in your backpack offline
[24:57.480 --> 24:59.480]  You can just use your iPhone and access
[24:59.480 --> 25:07.000]  Backblazes stuff and get any one file that you need send it off send it off from the iPhone app great great software
[25:07.640 --> 25:09.640]  You get a risk-free
[25:09.960 --> 25:14.560]  No credit card required required trial nothing's wrong
[25:14.560 --> 25:18.000]  I don't think with a credit card required trial, but it's of course
[25:18.000 --> 25:22.040]  It's better without one because when you put your credit card in you think that means if I forget
[25:22.440 --> 25:29.120]  When the trials up they're gonna start charging me now you don't have to worry about that you just sign up no credit card required trial
[25:29.120 --> 25:35.320]  At backblaze.com slash daring fireball and get started you get a whole month to see how it works
[25:35.320 --> 25:38.920]  And I guarantee it by the end of that you'll be given them your credit card. You're gonna want to sign up
[25:39.680 --> 25:47.520]  And the whole thing it's it's five bucks a month five bucks a month for each Mac that you want to have in your backblaze account
[25:49.120 --> 25:52.560]  It's the best deal. I've ever heard of for online backup
[25:52.560 --> 25:57.320]  So my thanks to them remember go to backblaze.com slash daring fireball
[25:57.320 --> 26:02.480]  They keep sponsoring a show because people keep signing up. I can't believe everybody hasn't signed up already
[26:03.480 --> 26:05.680]  Actually have a backblaze pro tip
[26:06.560 --> 26:12.960]  Because the first time I you know that first sync obviously is gonna take a long time because there's whatever a terabyte of
[26:13.280 --> 26:16.680]  Data, but it was going so unbelievably slow
[26:16.680 --> 26:17.720]  I didn't know what was wrong
[26:17.720 --> 26:24.760]  It was like you know would maybe do a hundred meg a day and it turned out that my stupid iMac was falling asleep after
[26:24.760 --> 26:30.680]  Whatever 10 minutes each time and that was interrupting the upload process somehow
[26:31.640 --> 26:37.880]  So I turned sleep off and boom it was done in like two days. Yeah, just have it said to display it to sleep your monitor
[26:38.000 --> 26:44.360]  Yeah, so and maybe it's because that's a old old ass. I Mac that you know
[26:44.960 --> 26:47.480]  With the spinning hard drive and all that stuff, but
[26:47.480 --> 26:53.560]  Try that if it's if you need to speed up. I have heard one
[26:54.680 --> 26:59.880]  Whisper, I mean, and this is hardly a this is like third party third-hand
[27:01.080 --> 27:06.600]  Just something floating in the wind, but that the whatever the wearable thing that they have
[27:07.160 --> 27:09.160]  Coming out that it has a square display
[27:10.360 --> 27:13.800]  Hmm, I don't even I would so I would so it has a display
[27:13.800 --> 27:18.640]  That's what I've heard that it has a display which to me is interesting if it's true
[27:18.840 --> 27:20.600]  Because it implies a lot of things
[27:20.600 --> 27:25.920]  I think because if it has a display to me that means it's gonna it may be it is more of a watch type thing
[27:25.920 --> 27:30.040]  I I've declined to call it a watch and I've certainly declined to call it the eye watch
[27:31.520 --> 27:37.840]  Not because I know that it is not a watch and I've seen people on Twitter speculate on that that I call it a
[27:38.040 --> 27:40.040]  risk wearable thing
[27:40.040 --> 27:43.360]  And that doesn't mean that I know that it's not a watch
[27:43.360 --> 27:46.760]  It just means that I don't know what the heck it is and I don't know that it is a watch
[27:46.760 --> 27:48.760]  I just know that they're working on a
[27:49.160 --> 27:50.760]  risk wearable thing
[27:50.760 --> 27:52.760]  Yeah, I've heard that it has a square display
[27:53.640 --> 27:57.800]  Hmm, well, I think that I think it kind of has to well, I don't know
[27:57.800 --> 28:05.480]  I've the those mock-ups that you see where people make it like the whole band is a flexible display and it's a lot of it is display
[28:05.480 --> 28:07.480]  they look cool as a
[28:07.480 --> 28:15.000]  As a mock-up, but I think they're problematic if you think about it in practical terms because which way are they oriented?
[28:15.560 --> 28:18.920]  Yeah, you know what I mean like if if you know if you've seen those mock-ups
[28:18.920 --> 28:20.920]  but if it's just a band and
[28:21.480 --> 28:24.520]  Like at the whole top half of it is a color display
[28:25.880 --> 28:28.600]  To get a lot of text you'd have to turn your wrist sideways
[28:28.840 --> 28:31.640]  Otherwise, you just have a real skinny display that's real tall
[28:31.640 --> 28:38.040]  And I even had some stupid ideas were like the display part pops out and you can spin it
[28:39.160 --> 28:41.160]  That doesn't make any sense, but
[28:41.480 --> 28:43.480]  Yeah, I don't know
[28:43.480 --> 28:47.320]  So I don't know I don't remember the last time I talked to you about this, but
[28:48.600 --> 28:55.800]  I did a story a few weeks ago for courts where I dug up every Apple wearable that they've ever shipped
[28:55.800 --> 29:00.680]  And posted photos of it, you know dating back to the old
[29:01.640 --> 29:04.520]  iPod remote which clipped on to your shirt
[29:05.240 --> 29:11.240]  And actually my favorite with with a Sony mini disc remote controls, which I didn't I don't think I posted in the article
[29:11.240 --> 29:12.760]  But they were awesome
[29:12.920 --> 29:16.040]  They had like little display on them and they clipped right onto your shirt
[29:17.000 --> 29:24.640]  But then also Apple you know has done obviously earbuds and the iPod shuffle series including you know three or four different designs of the
[29:24.640 --> 29:30.560]  iPod shuffle including one that they had kind of screwed up and had to revert course and
[29:32.400 --> 29:36.080]  And then of course the the last one was the iPod
[29:36.880 --> 29:41.680]  Nano, which people made watch bands. Yeah, not the current iPod Nano
[29:42.480 --> 29:46.720]  Right previous iPod. Yeah, I've got one of those in my hand right now
[29:47.360 --> 29:53.600]  Yeah, which which is surprisingly similar obviously, you know many years of past and technologies improve
[29:53.600 --> 29:56.000]  but those like LG and Samsung
[29:56.720 --> 30:00.080]  Watches just seem like they're that yeah, and I
[30:01.200 --> 30:03.680]  Don't know maybe Apple was like oh, this is brilliant. Let's
[30:04.800 --> 30:11.280]  Let's shift course on the iPod Nano and we'll we'll come back to this watch thing and make it look just like this in a few years
[30:12.080 --> 30:16.640]  But I don't know you know it seems to me like if that was the right course of action
[30:16.640 --> 30:19.520]  They would have just kept with it. I think it was called the TikTok
[30:19.520 --> 30:25.040]  TIK TOK it was it was an early and kickstarter and
[30:25.840 --> 30:31.520]  Huge success a watch band to fit the this little the little square Nano
[30:32.000 --> 30:34.000]  I have it I have one right here
[30:34.000 --> 30:37.840]  And I believe Apple later sold them in this in their store. Yeah, they did sell them
[30:37.840 --> 30:39.840]  I think and I think other companies came out with them
[30:39.840 --> 30:41.840]  I don't think anybody had the success that these guys had
[30:42.080 --> 30:45.600]  But I've said to people before like when I see these Android wear
[30:45.600 --> 30:49.040]  Devices coming out that if they don't look better
[30:49.840 --> 30:52.240]  than the tiktok which
[30:53.040 --> 30:58.720]  You know the the iPod Nano combined with the tiktok which is a device that wasn't even designed to be a watch
[30:59.440 --> 31:01.440]  Then that's a problem
[31:01.440 --> 31:05.120]  Yeah, like if you can't if you can't make a watch that looks better
[31:05.520 --> 31:10.480]  Than a device that wasn't really designed to be a watch that could be made into one by a kickstarter
[31:10.480 --> 31:15.040]  Four years ago four years ago or whatever it was three or four years ago. Yeah
[31:15.920 --> 31:22.160]  And that's you know that the round screen like maybe that's progress but but just everything about iOS
[31:23.360 --> 31:30.960]  And obviously Mac OS our has been built on you know screens with corners and a top and a bottom and that kind of stuff and
[31:32.720 --> 31:36.560]  Like if you see how hard it's been just to get people to make iPad apps
[31:36.560 --> 31:39.680]  I don't know about
[31:40.400 --> 31:44.160]  Getting you know having everyone rethink everything again for a round
[31:44.720 --> 31:46.720]  Well around makes sense given
[31:47.360 --> 31:52.240]  Traditional watches and clocks where you're you've got this radial dial of
[31:52.960 --> 31:56.800]  Yeah, no minute an hour and second hands that sweep around in a circle it
[31:57.520 --> 32:01.520]  It makes sense you're showing circular dials it makes sense to put it in a circle. It's a reason why
[32:01.520 --> 32:08.480]  All sorts of things that use a dial like a speedometer in a car
[32:08.720 --> 32:10.720]  You know the
[32:10.720 --> 32:14.920]  Techometer in a car have Rob circle, right crop circles
[32:15.280 --> 32:19.760]  Sun dials have you know traditionally been or often are circles
[32:20.560 --> 32:27.680]  But you know for everything else it does it circles are pretty problematic as a display like for displaying text of any kind because
[32:28.240 --> 32:30.240]  You only get the full width right at the
[32:30.240 --> 32:32.560]  I don't know the what would you call it the equator. Yeah
[32:33.520 --> 32:35.520]  Yeah, unless you're supposed to read it
[32:36.800 --> 32:42.000]  You know in a spiral or something right laying out text in a circle is incredibly inefficient. Yeah
[32:43.520 --> 32:48.880]  Yeah, so when you say square do you literally mean square do you mean rectangular? No, I mean square
[32:49.440 --> 32:51.920]  I'm like, you know like the iPod now
[32:52.960 --> 32:54.560]  Interesting I
[32:54.560 --> 33:00.000]  You know again this I mean you can I don't know there's probably another freaking bullshit thing that business insiders
[33:00.000 --> 33:06.400]  Gonna screwber says I I pod nano is a square. I should be right right now. I might still have a login
[33:06.400 --> 33:12.400]  I don't know it should say if it wanted to be honest. They should take ruber says sketchy third-hand
[33:13.520 --> 33:15.520]  Source here's whisper that
[33:16.080 --> 33:18.560]  Apple wearable thing might have square display
[33:19.760 --> 33:25.360]  Yeah, I don't see that. I don't know. I don't know. I wouldn't bet money on it. Well, I'd better look now
[33:25.360 --> 33:29.120]  Okay, not much. I wouldn't bet big I
[33:30.080 --> 33:36.080]  Would bet big that there will be it there will be a some wearable thing unveiled in September or october
[33:36.080 --> 33:39.920]  I would bet an extra five dollars that it would have a square display
[33:42.320 --> 33:44.320]  I could see that all right
[33:44.320 --> 33:50.720]  Anybody I'm on that side too, so the biggest implication to me of it having a display is battery life
[33:50.720 --> 34:00.360]  Because the battery having a display to me is means that it's gonna it leads to all sorts of questions about how that how is this thing going to have
[34:01.040 --> 34:03.040]  a usable battery life
[34:03.040 --> 34:05.040]  Yeah, because that is
[34:05.280 --> 34:08.800]  Though the one nice thing about this Nexus 7 is that it's already told me that
[34:09.440 --> 34:12.600]  Over half of the power I've consumed is the screen
[34:13.520 --> 34:14.760]  Yeah
[34:14.760 --> 34:18.800]  There's a desire say tell you that I don't remember something like that
[34:18.800 --> 34:25.840]  Yeah, you know what they have an app shaming feature, but I don't think like like Android has had that for a while and
[34:26.320 --> 34:31.160]  We'll tell you things that aren't just based on the app, but things like cellular networking
[34:31.680 --> 34:38.000]  In general and that the display just the power to display. I think that the iOS 8 feature
[34:38.720 --> 34:44.280]  only lists apps by the order that which in which they've consumed energy
[34:44.280 --> 34:48.440]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, so 58% of my Nexus 7
[34:49.400 --> 34:52.040]  Energy consumption has been the screen today. I
[34:52.920 --> 34:57.000]  Have a feeling that that app shaming feature and I was yeah, I think it's improved popular
[34:57.800 --> 34:59.280]  I
[34:59.280 --> 35:02.480]  Think it's also going to cause some weird problems
[35:02.480 --> 35:05.800]  I think part of it is because people are going to be surprised by what's using the power
[35:06.920 --> 35:13.000]  I've heard I don't use Facebook, so I don't know, but I've heard from a lot of people that Facebook dot app uses consumes and
[35:13.000 --> 35:16.360]  unseemly amount of energy based on
[35:17.160 --> 35:21.320]  The default settings for background like stuff that it tries to go. Yeah
[35:22.200 --> 35:28.720]  Interesting, well, that's good then so I think then I think I think it might might even be a big reason why app because of course
[35:28.720 --> 35:31.720]  And you know in combination with the fact that it uses a lot of power
[35:31.720 --> 35:36.040]  It's on a lot of iPhones and people probably more than any other app
[35:36.600 --> 35:37.640]  That's a good question
[35:37.640 --> 35:50.200]  I thought about that with the Google sponsorship of of Daring Fireball for iOS apps
[35:51.160 --> 35:59.480]  I would guess the most popular of the Google app, right, but you know, I would think so, you know, but a bunch of their apps are very popular
[35:59.880 --> 36:02.200]  Gmail's their Gmail app is super popular
[36:02.200 --> 36:11.640]  Yeah, there's search app. Yeah, which I think was their first app. Maybe. Yeah, I think the one that's just called Google and it's the one that gives you the Google now
[36:12.080 --> 36:14.080]  function out
[36:16.280 --> 36:22.560]  But clearly with the Google up with certain Google's apps you can reach a lot more people than our YouTube is probably
[36:22.560 --> 36:26.520]  Maybe number one maybe YouTube is number one. I don't know because for so long
[36:26.520 --> 36:30.240]  It was a system app and then everyone had to re-get it. Oh, I don't know
[36:30.240 --> 36:35.040]  Or at least on certain contingent of people. It's got to be number one. Like, you know, my my
[36:35.040 --> 36:41.440]  I'm gonna guess Facebook is the all-time number one. Yeah, I would if I had to bet on what's the most popular app of all
[36:41.440 --> 36:45.680]  What which app is on the highest percentage of iPhones and use I would say Facebook?
[36:46.400 --> 36:50.560]  So if that is really a huge power suck then we're gonna hear about right?
[36:51.600 --> 36:55.520]  Although, you know, there's a difference between consumption and
[36:55.520 --> 37:01.880]  Well, the bandwidth example is another one. So I just did a post on Friday where I
[37:04.280 --> 37:11.560]  Revealed the where the last six point eight gigs of my cellular data have gone and the the biggest
[37:13.120 --> 37:17.320]  The biggest source was Twitter Twitter, which you know, you think of as a simple
[37:18.440 --> 37:20.440]  140 character text app
[37:20.440 --> 37:25.160]  Used over two gigabytes of data for me in the last few months
[37:26.480 --> 37:29.200]  Just kind of surprising and you know, of course a lot of that is
[37:30.040 --> 37:33.400]  Photos and built-in web browser or that kind of stuff
[37:33.400 --> 37:38.520]  But you know, I never would have guessed that Twitter was my number one bandwidth hog
[37:39.080 --> 37:44.600]  And actually I asked courts readers to fill out a survey of their number one
[37:44.600 --> 37:50.960]  App that uses the most cellular bandwidth. I'm gonna do it right up of those findings too
[37:50.960 --> 37:57.600]  But a lot of them I looked at them so far a lot of them also say tweet bot and yeah, and Twitter. So well, it is the case with my
[37:59.400 --> 38:04.280]  My iOS 8 phone I'm using my iOS 8 this summer on the beta's on my year old
[38:04.280 --> 38:09.360]  iPhone 5 that every time I go you go to settings general usage
[38:09.360 --> 38:17.120]  Battery usage, and it shows you if you wait a couple seconds. It lists your apps by battery usage tweet bot is number one for me
[38:18.040 --> 38:25.360]  But I know how much I use Twitter when I'm on my phone and that includes like when I tap a link
[38:25.520 --> 38:28.360]  Most of the time I just read it right there in tweet bots
[38:29.400 --> 38:30.660]  built-in browser
[38:30.660 --> 38:38.440]  Totally, and I'll use it to watch videos too and you know, it's not just the actual tweets that I'm reading the way that on iOS
[38:38.440 --> 38:43.740]  You load the web pages and videos and stuff by default in the Twitter client contributes to that so
[38:45.600 --> 38:49.600]  Based on my you know, and I don't know exactly how much I use tweet bot
[38:49.600 --> 38:56.360]  But my hunch is that their battery, you know, they're their number one ranking in the battery usage is totally fair
[38:56.360 --> 39:00.080]  And it's in a completely in line with how much I use tweet bot
[39:00.280 --> 39:05.400]  But I suspect that there's gonna be a lot of people and I even saw I think Paul I think it was Paul Haddad from
[39:05.400 --> 39:11.320]  The the app bots or tweet bot whatever their company name is tap bots
[39:13.720 --> 39:16.720]  What do I call it app bots and that would work too?
[39:18.320 --> 39:24.200]  Tap bots he even said back right after the feature was announced in WWDC that he's dreading it because he knows
[39:24.200 --> 39:31.280]  You know that they're gonna you know, they're gonna get blamed for hey, you know my iPhone says tweet bots using the most power
[39:31.280 --> 39:35.640]  All right, no actually you're just a Twitter addict and that's that's how it works
[39:35.640 --> 39:40.880]  Yeah, but it's so Facebook is using a lot of power in the background. No, that's you know
[39:41.320 --> 39:50.400]  That's potentially problematic another and I actually think I've turned off background app refresh for Facebook and location services
[39:51.760 --> 39:56.440]  Yeah, and a lot of like the new four-square app too is always polling your location
[39:56.440 --> 40:00.800]  I turned all that stuff off. Yeah, there was a thing I linked to maybe it was months ago now
[40:00.800 --> 40:05.200]  But I know it was a couple weeks ago where it was a former Apple genius posting a top 10
[40:05.240 --> 40:11.360]  Here's how to get more battery from your iPhone and like number. Oh, yeah, number one was turn off everything for Facebook in the background
[40:12.560 --> 40:15.000]  Totally, but it doesn't think that though
[40:15.000 --> 40:18.640]  I think someone was saying how they did that and then there the percentage went up
[40:19.400 --> 40:22.480]  Maybe even on the show. I don't know. I don't know. I do know
[40:22.480 --> 40:28.160]  I just checked on my beta iPhone that it doesn't list anything like the screen or okay anything like that
[40:28.160 --> 40:30.160]  It's all it's just a list of apps
[40:30.160 --> 40:37.560]  Hmm, but anyway, I do think though that the if it has a screen and it sounds to me like it probably does that
[40:38.040 --> 40:44.800]  It unless Apple has invented some kind of new technology, which I wouldn't put past them, but that it could mean that it's like a
[40:46.120 --> 40:49.000]  In the best case you've got to charge it every couple days thing
[40:51.080 --> 40:59.020]  Yeah, I also met with a guy not long ago who makes chips for wearable devices and some of the stuff that is going on there is
[40:59.020 --> 41:03.180]  Interesting to like chips that generate power based on
[41:04.180 --> 41:09.620]  Motion and that kind of stuff, right? Which is an old idea from the watch world right where automatic watches
[41:10.420 --> 41:13.980]  Which have been around? I think they came out in the 50s
[41:13.980 --> 41:18.100]  But I think they were sort of a novelty but then by the 60s, you know a lot of high-end most high-end
[41:18.620 --> 41:22.900]  wristwatches were you know could come you know came with an automatic movement which meant
[41:22.900 --> 41:29.860]  That once wound if you wore it just the motion of going through the day would keep the
[41:30.220 --> 41:32.220]  I forget what it's called the wellspring
[41:32.220 --> 41:37.860]  Something like that some kind of spring keep it wound so as long as you keep wearing the watch it'll stay
[41:38.180 --> 41:39.180]  Wow
[41:39.180 --> 41:43.340]  Right I once bought a watch that was powered by water and that was stupid
[41:43.900 --> 41:47.100]  That didn't work very well. What do you mean are you serious?
[41:47.340 --> 41:51.380]  Yeah, I think there was a there was a you just like put water on it and then it would
[41:51.380 --> 41:53.380]  supposedly
[41:53.540 --> 41:55.540]  Shock itself maybe and it would work
[41:56.380 --> 42:02.740]  It was awful it fairly, you know, it didn't really work from imagining something like the mr. Fusion drive from back to the future
[42:03.620 --> 42:05.620]  Where it like yeah, right?
[42:06.060 --> 42:11.060]  Yeah, it's like trying to power a light bulb with a potato or something. It just you know
[42:11.060 --> 42:20.620]  All right, but the watch world long recognized that even just daily winding your watch was a pain in the ass and
[42:21.580 --> 42:27.860]  So I wore you know, I think that the effort that went into designing automatic movements. It's to me fastening to me
[42:27.860 --> 42:29.980]  It's exactly like you know
[42:29.980 --> 42:34.140]  It's like that I think the type of minds even today that go into like being like a
[42:35.100 --> 42:37.540]  You know mechanical watchmaker or
[42:37.540 --> 42:41.820]  Someone who repairs it is a lot like being a programmer because you're thinking of
[42:42.580 --> 42:49.020]  You know if this you know the gear moves this way it'll do this and 60 times a minute. It'll do this and
[42:49.620 --> 42:55.420]  You know, it's the same sort of logical mindset that that required for computer programming
[42:55.420 --> 42:59.780]  I think coming up with these automatic movements that never need to be wound as long as you keep wearing them
[43:00.220 --> 43:06.820]  Took a enormous amount of work, but I think it's because they recognized that daily every day waking up and having a winder watch was
[43:06.820 --> 43:08.820]  You know keeping people from wearing watches
[43:09.820 --> 43:15.060]  Yeah, and as you know how many charging stations you need by your next year of bed now
[43:15.060 --> 43:18.780]  I mean it you know that that motor roller watch thing did not look
[43:19.700 --> 43:23.220]  Like the kind of thing I'd want to have to deal with every day or two
[43:23.220 --> 43:27.300]  Right, and there's so many questions like a device you have to charge comes with so many things number one
[43:27.300 --> 43:35.020]  Just how many devices you have to charge on a regular basis like it's asking a lot each even asking for one is a lot like they're could come a time
[43:35.020 --> 43:41.880]  20 or 30 years from now where we look back on having to charge anything on a regular basis as
[43:42.740 --> 43:44.180]  laughable
[43:44.180 --> 43:48.620]  Right, and yet at the same time now we've I mean I don't have to charge my iPad every day
[43:48.620 --> 43:53.540]  But I certainly have to charge my iPhone every day and even then it's like that means every time I travel
[43:53.540 --> 43:55.540]  I've got to take a charger
[43:55.540 --> 43:58.140]  All right, so the clasp of the watch is the
[43:59.140 --> 44:01.620]  Lightning port
[44:01.620 --> 44:07.980]  Plug yeah, you know, it that's it raises a question. No, but like is is lightning our lightning ports waterproof
[44:07.980 --> 44:11.340]  I've heard some people speculate that they are
[44:11.580 --> 44:16.060]  You know that the one reason phones the iPhone still is a waterproof is the audio port
[44:16.860 --> 44:20.140]  And the phones that claim to be I don't know
[44:20.140 --> 44:25.900]  I think that a traditional audio port can't be made waterproof people correct me if I'm wrong
[44:25.900 --> 44:33.020]  But that lightning in theory could be but Apple doesn't advertise it as such because the iPhone is a lot of resistance
[44:33.020 --> 44:35.900]  So they did just don't want to get into that but the lightning port could be
[44:37.380 --> 44:40.100]  But a lightning port on a watch would be ugly
[44:40.980 --> 44:46.060]  Yeah, I mean that's just yeah the Nike fuel ban has this weird thing where the
[44:46.900 --> 44:49.860]  lock locking clasp type thing is
[44:49.860 --> 44:58.260]  Part of the charging system, right? So yeah, I guess if the if they but you still needed like a little dock for it
[44:58.500 --> 45:00.500]  Right, and it wasn't wasn't great
[45:00.980 --> 45:05.100]  All right, so I guess if you hit it somewhere else on the watch on the band somewhere
[45:05.100 --> 45:08.380]  Yeah, maybe you could do it put it somewhere where it's you know when you have it off
[45:08.380 --> 45:12.380]  You're I've exposed but when it's on you don't see it could be something clever like that
[45:12.420 --> 45:18.020]  But even then even if it's a lightning port you're still asking people who you know if to have another
[45:18.020 --> 45:20.940]  Lightning port at their bedside
[45:21.740 --> 45:25.180]  Yeah, right and another one that you take with you when you travel
[45:26.980 --> 45:34.780]  Yeah, and there's also like this wireless charging stuff, but it seems like it's still several years away from
[45:34.900 --> 45:38.620]  So wireless charging ports are or or I guess it's not a port
[45:38.620 --> 45:41.900]  But wireless charging is interesting because then you don't have an ugly port on the device
[45:42.260 --> 45:45.860]  Right, but then you've got to have a dock that you take with you everywhere
[45:45.860 --> 45:49.580]  You got to have one wherever you want to charge it and so if you you know have one bedside
[45:49.580 --> 45:54.700]  And then when you travel what do you do do you take your take your one with you or do you buy have to buy a second one
[45:55.140 --> 46:02.620]  For $50 and keep it in your system. It's not it's not ready. I mean someday it'll be built into all kinds of stuff
[46:02.620 --> 46:05.140]  like I think Starbucks is rolling out at
[46:05.820 --> 46:11.940]  New tables the heaven built into the table or something. Yeah, but it's gonna take way too long before
[46:12.580 --> 46:14.580]  That's even right
[46:14.580 --> 46:18.220]  So I don't know if it if it was a device without a screen
[46:18.220 --> 46:25.460]  I could see how Apple could have something and you know a lot of inventive stuff to keep power usage down and maybe you know
[46:25.460 --> 46:29.220]  Like you said like kinetic motion so that you could use that to charge it
[46:29.940 --> 46:36.620]  I have a citizen watch from a couple years ago that has they call it EcoDrive
[46:36.820 --> 46:38.820]  ECO-DR IV
[46:39.660 --> 46:41.660]  it's a
[46:41.660 --> 46:44.780]  quartz watch battery operated, but the battery recharges
[46:46.060 --> 46:48.060]  with a solar
[46:48.260 --> 46:55.460]  Cell that's on the face of the watch and which you can hardly see I can certain light you can see that it's not really a black
[46:56.300 --> 46:58.780]  dial it's it's got like a
[46:59.900 --> 47:04.980]  Slightly not black in the center of it because it's actually a solar cell and it's worked great
[47:04.980 --> 47:09.300]  the watch keeps perfect time and I've never needed to replace the battery
[47:09.300 --> 47:13.460]  Wait, you know way past the time when you'd have to replace a regular quartz watch battery
[47:14.100 --> 47:18.020]  But I don't think there's much, you know, I think it you know
[47:19.020 --> 47:23.300]  Using solar to charge something that only tells the time and the day of the month is
[47:24.300 --> 47:27.740]  Far cry from even a no display fitness tracker
[47:27.780 --> 47:34.420]  That's going to have Bluetooth and you know others type of things like that. Yeah, and the minute you add the Instagram app
[47:34.420 --> 47:39.940]  Okay, all bets are off, but if it has a display, I think some kind of magical charging
[47:40.540 --> 47:45.300]  Seemingly magical charging that doesn't need you to charge it in every couple days is out of the question
[47:45.300 --> 47:50.220]  I think if it has a display it's got to be something you charge every couple days at least and
[47:50.740 --> 47:55.300]  Then that means to me that it has to be far more compelling in terms of what it does
[47:55.900 --> 48:00.420]  Yeah, you know to get people to buy into the hassle of buying another daily
[48:00.420 --> 48:04.660]  Or near daily charging device
[48:04.660 --> 48:08.740]  It's got to be way more compelling than something that hey just buy this, you know
[48:08.740 --> 48:11.820]  Put on your wrist and it'll just work for weeks until you need to charge it
[48:12.340 --> 48:17.140]  Do you think it has a headphone jack? Oh, probably not if it needs to be water resistant
[48:17.140 --> 48:20.540]  Right, I think anything you put on your wrist has to be water resistant. Yeah, and you know
[48:20.540 --> 48:28.620]  Especially those old watches that have like a built-in am radio, right, and I got very excited about that that idea of listening to
[48:28.620 --> 48:32.660]  Baseball game, you know without needing anything else, but
[48:33.300 --> 48:36.740]  Not very practical also you look like a moron with
[48:37.460 --> 48:43.380]  Earbuds coming off your wrist. Yeah, you do. That's actually the reason I bought the TikTok is I thought hey
[48:43.380 --> 48:45.980]  This would be great. I can you then I can wear my
[48:46.700 --> 48:54.820]  Nano on my wrist when I run, but yeah somehow it's it's way to I found it way worse and at my arm was always getting tangled in the cord
[48:54.820 --> 48:58.620]  compared to compare to the arm bands like kind of work, but
[48:59.420 --> 49:03.580]  You know a lot of people run with the arm arm band around your bicep or something right
[49:03.580 --> 49:07.140]  But they were all the way down your wrist right it's because it's all the way down your wrist
[49:07.140 --> 49:08.380]  Yeah, it doesn't work out as well
[49:08.380 --> 49:16.860]  I think that if it's somehow broadcast audio, it has to be over Bluetooth. Yeah. Yeah, oh right the the blue tooth earpods
[49:17.620 --> 49:20.260]  That were someone made up the the fake
[49:20.260 --> 49:25.620]  Secret about those. Oh, you're right on the secret out somebody posted a
[49:26.300 --> 49:31.060]  Yeah, I don't think we I don't know if I ever talked about on the show because it happened at WWDC
[49:31.300 --> 49:37.140]  What's that what it was? Yeah, it was like right before or something. No, it was while I was in San Francisco for WWDC
[49:37.140 --> 49:40.740]  And it was it's such a busy hectic week for me, but yeah, there was a
[49:41.860 --> 49:46.860]  Again, I think top of tech meme it was like an anonymous post on secret that somebody who had been on the
[49:46.860 --> 49:54.700]  Wireless headphones team was just let go from Apple and that and that the whole team had been let go and that they were so better that they were going to spoil it
[49:55.380 --> 50:02.980]  Yeah, right, and there are wireless headphones, you know coming out for new devices this fall and then like couple after everybody
[50:03.340 --> 50:09.860]  Taken it is oh this anonymous post on secret. It must be true or is probably true or is at least worth reporting
[50:09.980 --> 50:14.140]  Then a couple days later the same guy was like, hey, I'm sorry. I made the whole thing up
[50:14.140 --> 50:16.140]  Yeah
[50:16.260 --> 50:18.260]  Just great, you know
[50:18.260 --> 50:22.940]  Oh, it's plausible, but no, it wasn't plausible if I forget the exact details of it
[50:22.940 --> 50:27.540]  But it wasn't plausible because it doesn't it didn't make any sense where all its earbuds are kind of plausible
[50:27.540 --> 50:30.300]  Oh, yeah, but it didn't make any sense that Apple would disband the team
[50:30.500 --> 50:33.060]  No, no if they were successful at designing
[50:33.060 --> 50:37.620]  I mean like if they had failed to design the headphones maybe that got people would get fired because hey
[50:37.620 --> 50:39.980]  We told you to design wireless headphones and you didn't do it
[50:39.980 --> 50:44.940]  But if they did the point of the post was that we did and that they're coming out and they're pretty cool and it's like well
[50:44.940 --> 50:51.820]  Then why why would Apple yeah, fire you? Yeah, Apple doesn't get it you get a promotion and you take over everything, right?
[50:53.340 --> 50:55.340]  It was like a complete
[50:56.060 --> 51:01.140]  No company it's not like oh Apple is the one company that does that like what company what same company would fire?
[51:02.140 --> 51:04.180]  I grew up around around for some might but
[51:04.180 --> 51:10.620]  Congratulations on just successfully well, I would be as part of Microsoft might as part of a
[51:11.260 --> 51:17.460]  Down-sizing right they've announced that they've got to lay people off to they want to reduce headcount Apple is not having a lay-off
[51:18.580 --> 51:24.820]  No, although I was a little interesting that they got rid of so many people for beats, but I guess those were not like the core
[51:26.020 --> 51:28.900]  People that they acquired the company for so
[51:28.900 --> 51:34.980]  Yeah, it certainly wasn't why they required the company right right I wonder if there if that's
[51:35.460 --> 51:42.300]  Gonna be something they talk about yet in September slash October or if it's too soon for that like a you know any sort of
[51:43.700 --> 51:50.100]  New stuff from beats stuff from beats the one thing I'd love is an Apple TV app because
[51:50.660 --> 51:54.100]  None of the other subscription music services have one and
[51:54.100 --> 51:59.220]  And that would be you know a reason for me to think about using beats as if I could
[51:59.460 --> 52:01.700]  I never thought of us from it from the TV
[52:01.700 --> 52:06.860]  Yeah, I was thinking the other day because you know I have my whole iTunes batch library available there and
[52:07.460 --> 52:08.900]  wanted to
[52:08.900 --> 52:15.900]  Use that to play music when we had some people over and you know like oh, there's no Spotify app on the or
[52:16.180 --> 52:22.300]  Audio app on the Apple TV it'd be awesome if they kick one out pretty quickly for beats
[52:22.300 --> 52:28.220]  But it might be asking too much. It's only I think the deal just closed like a couple weeks ago
[52:28.220 --> 52:33.100]  So yeah, I wonder about that and I wonder I wonder to how it ties into
[52:34.220 --> 52:40.620]  Whether or not and I you know again this is pure speculation, but whether or not there's a major Apple TV update
[52:41.340 --> 52:43.180]  Coming soon
[52:43.180 --> 52:48.900]  You know even if it's isn't there like a beta one with it with a slightly refreshed look or something
[52:48.900 --> 52:52.740]  No, I don't know about that. I don't know if it has a new look. I if there is I didn't see that
[52:53.740 --> 52:58.820]  I think there's a new build last week. Oh, I don't know. I haven't I don't touch the betas for that kind of stuff
[52:58.820 --> 53:01.540]  So I'm not sure all right
[53:01.540 --> 53:08.100]  But I just wonder though that if Apple was going to commit to making a beats app for Apple TV whether they would do it for the current
[53:08.580 --> 53:10.820]  Apple TV generation or
[53:10.820 --> 53:14.380]  Put that in the right. Yeah, third major version of the iOS
[53:15.100 --> 53:16.940]  Apple TV
[53:16.940 --> 53:22.940]  Yeah, they've been adding a bunch of stuff a lot of it is, you know, not very useful, but
[53:23.900 --> 53:29.820]  I think there's a new NFL app coming or something like that. Yeah. Well, or it isn't it gonna have
[53:33.500 --> 53:40.780]  Possible to do the Sunday ticket. I don't know if they announced that I think because I think direct TV still controls that
[53:40.780 --> 53:43.500]  But I think there's an NFL app that does other stuff
[53:43.500 --> 53:49.780]  Hmm, but I don't I haven't been paying that close of attention. No, here it is Apple TV
[53:49.780 --> 53:54.920]  NFL Sunday ticket coming to iOS. Oh, not not Apple TV iOS and Mac for
[53:55.220 --> 53:57.380]  2014 no, it's it is decoupled from
[53:57.900 --> 54:02.340]  Direct TV now. It's no longer exclusive to Direct TV, which I think is gonna be huge. Well
[54:03.180 --> 54:05.640]  No, that's not actually true. No
[54:07.860 --> 54:11.340]  People got really excited because there was some news release about that
[54:11.340 --> 54:15.540]  But if you if you read the fine print you have to punch in your zip code and
[54:16.860 --> 54:24.700]  Most of America does not qualify for the streaming direct streaming Sunday ticket like my in Chicago
[54:24.700 --> 54:28.340]  My mom's zip code does not qualify in New York
[54:28.340 --> 54:33.540]  You can do it, but you've always been able to do in New York because it's almost impossible to get direct TV here
[54:35.500 --> 54:39.420]  But yeah, that was like blown way out of proportion. That's actually not
[54:39.420 --> 54:41.740]  Hmm, not that not happening
[54:43.260 --> 54:47.940]  It's like university people who live in dorms can do it and then also people who live in
[54:48.660 --> 54:51.340]  basically New York City and maybe I don't know about some other
[54:52.380 --> 54:59.420]  Cities where you just can't install a dish or that they assume most people can because obviously I guess some people in New York City could but
[55:00.340 --> 55:01.900]  right
[55:01.900 --> 55:09.100]  But most people need like a place to you know screw in the satellite dish with a southern reception and all that kind of stuff
[55:09.100 --> 55:11.100]  Right, I don't have that
[55:12.900 --> 55:17.340]  So anyway, yeah, I don't know, but there's like I think an NFL app coming that
[55:19.140 --> 55:22.980]  It does some other stuff. Yeah, some NFL app. I don't know
[55:23.740 --> 55:29.500]  Yeah, well mostly the other major pro leagues have it have something somewhere. Yeah, at least in the US
[55:30.100 --> 55:37.220]  I mean that's half the reason I have it Apple TV is the at bat or whatever it's called right now no
[55:37.220 --> 55:40.540]  Breaking new ground here, but it
[55:41.140 --> 55:47.180]  It does though every every time they add an app or whatever you want to call on a channel to the current Apple TV
[55:47.180 --> 55:53.900]  It strains the limits of the simple up-down left-right infrared remote more and more
[55:54.540 --> 56:00.860]  So I'd still think that it's a sign that a new Apple TV is coming with some kind of new UI
[56:02.100 --> 56:06.620]  Yeah, at this point, you know, and you can like kind of hide this the stuff
[56:06.620 --> 56:08.620]  I guess but
[56:10.100 --> 56:13.220]  Up you know all the things that make the app store so
[56:14.060 --> 56:21.260]  Logical and great like you know developers being able to issue updates and all that kind of stuff that's still very much missing from
[56:22.220 --> 56:27.860]  Apple to current yeah, and the infrared things it's just it's just strained bar more because it's like
[56:27.860 --> 56:33.900]  Especially like some coasters in front of my Apple TV and I couldn't use the remote
[56:33.900 --> 56:38.020]  I had to move them right so they were blocking the line of sight right like we have
[56:38.420 --> 56:43.180]  the Xbox one now and I don't you really use it as a TV
[56:43.180 --> 56:46.660]  But it's like the main Xbox interface though is is
[56:47.260 --> 56:49.060]  Sort of like Windows 7
[56:49.060 --> 56:51.820]  You know with tiles and some of the tiles are big and some are small
[56:51.820 --> 56:57.900]  But you largely navigate it up-down left-right select but because you have a real controller and it's you know
[56:57.900 --> 57:02.140]  Got a Bluetooth connection every time you hit up it goes up every time you hit
[57:02.140 --> 57:08.940]  Right it goes right and it happens instantly because it's a controller. It's built for you know video game like
[57:12.260 --> 57:18.140]  Timing and then every time I go back to the Apple TV and it's like up up up up up up just to go up once
[57:19.540 --> 57:26.260]  Trying to target the loadling the little sensor exactly. It's like God this is maddening even just switching the Bluetooth would be a huge upgrade
[57:26.260 --> 57:27.620]  I think that they'll probably do more
[57:27.620 --> 57:32.820]  But even if they just came out with an Apple TV that had a Bluetooth remote and stuck to up-down left-right select
[57:33.140 --> 57:35.140]  It would be an upgrade
[57:35.140 --> 57:37.900]  I think that's probably the kind of thing that's ready to roll
[57:37.900 --> 57:39.740]  They're just they're waiting for other stuff
[57:39.740 --> 57:44.860]  But I wonder too though if they have something more in mind for the main interface than just a
[57:45.700 --> 57:50.980]  Five by whatever grid of apps because it's there's a certain limit to that, you know
[57:51.500 --> 57:53.740]  To the usefulness of that
[57:53.740 --> 57:55.740]  Yeah, I see you know
[57:55.740 --> 58:00.500]  But you also think they may have done that for the phone by now and they haven't yeah, I've done anything like that
[58:00.500 --> 58:05.020]  So I wonder and if they do it with the beats app. I wonder it would be an interesting sign of
[58:05.780 --> 58:11.220]  How are they gonna treat beats like are they gonna treat beats as part of Apple cuz you know how like there's you can?
[58:11.620 --> 58:17.180]  Hold select down on Apple TV on any of the apps outside the top row and move them around
[58:17.260 --> 58:21.580]  So like if you use Netflix all the time you can make sure that it's in the upper left
[58:21.580 --> 58:30.060]  Right below the built-in movies app, but the movies TV shows music computers and settings apps are locked in in the top row
[58:30.060 --> 58:36.940]  The ones that are tied to Apple stuff like would be beats treated as one of those Apple things that you can't move around over to be
[58:37.540 --> 58:39.540]  like
[58:39.540 --> 58:44.260]  More like iTunes trailers which is an app that you can move all the way to the bottom if you don't use it
[58:45.020 --> 58:49.380]  Right yeah, I mean my guess is probably more like iTunes trailers
[58:49.380 --> 58:54.260]  Yeah, I think so, but then they have two different music services. I don't know. It gets weird
[58:54.260 --> 58:55.460]  but I
[58:55.460 --> 59:03.220]  Where does beats go on in iOS to is it become part of the music app or is it always a separate app store app right?
[59:03.220 --> 59:06.500]  I think it'll I think they're gonna keep it separate and I think they're gonna keep
[59:07.060 --> 59:09.900]  Again the and the retail stores. I brought this up weeks ago
[59:09.900 --> 59:12.420]  Like when it was first announced, but like are they going to get rid of the
[59:12.420 --> 59:19.020]  Bose headphones and then you know, oh no JBL no, but are they gonna give beats special treatment?
[59:19.020 --> 59:25.020]  I mean, I don't think they'll give beats bad treatment if they might give them slightly premium treatment, you know in terms of
[59:25.020 --> 59:26.900]  I think they kind of do already. I mean half
[59:26.900 --> 59:30.500]  Yeah, it seems like so many of the headphones were beats to begin
[59:30.500 --> 59:32.820]  Yeah, I noticed that I when as soon as they announced
[59:33.300 --> 59:39.060]  Before they even announced it when it just was like a reported hey Apple is going to buy them for this much money
[59:39.060 --> 59:45.900]  And we were all like wow, I stopped in the Apple store just to look at how much beat stuff they had and where it was and I guess
[59:45.900 --> 59:50.900]  I think it was safe to say that that it was the most dominant headphone in the Apple store already
[59:50.900 --> 59:53.340]  But but still treated like this is
[59:53.900 --> 59:57.820]  Here's a section of the store where we sell stuff from other companies. Yeah
[59:58.340 --> 1:00:05.700]  All right, let me take a break and thank our second sponsor our good friends at square space you guys know square space

[1:01:59.980 --> 1:02:06.980]  You need to build a website for go check them out squarespace.com slash Gruber my thanks to square space long time
[1:02:07.340 --> 1:02:08.860]  supporter of this show
[1:02:08.860 --> 1:02:13.860]  So what else were we talking about? We're talking about I guess the events next week next month. Yeah, well
[1:02:15.420 --> 1:02:17.420]  Do you want to talk about the
[1:02:17.420 --> 1:02:21.740]  International like the Samsung's troubles in
[1:02:22.740 --> 1:02:28.340]  Yeah, cuz you wrote about that that was actually I wrote a little about it and I mean, I've been reading a lot about it
[1:02:28.340 --> 1:02:30.740]  And obviously I don't have the
[1:02:31.820 --> 1:02:37.540]  Encyclopedic knowledge that say Benedict Evans or Ben Thompson have about
[1:02:38.460 --> 1:02:40.460]  You know the Asian markets
[1:02:40.460 --> 1:02:48.980]  For mobile devices, but it's really interesting what's happening right now because and this was I don't know if I should
[1:02:48.980 --> 1:02:55.180]  I don't know if I was gonna write this poster not but remember that slide from the original iPhone announcement
[1:02:55.180 --> 1:03:02.740]  Where Steve Jobs had all the old smart phones up. Yeah, it seems like all those companies are gone basically
[1:03:03.340 --> 1:03:09.260]  Yeah, it was like palm palm Nokia and blackberry, right something like that
[1:03:09.260 --> 1:03:15.380]  Yeah, and did he have a Samsung up if he did it was the Samsung blackjack, which was their
[1:03:16.940 --> 1:03:20.300]  Lariously literally a copy of the of the blackberry right?
[1:03:20.820 --> 1:03:26.140]  I know he referenced the blackjack here. It's the the Motorola Q
[1:03:26.700 --> 1:03:30.500]  The blackberry the palm trio and the Nokia E62
[1:03:30.860 --> 1:03:33.700]  Yeah, so mola Nokia palm
[1:03:33.700 --> 1:03:38.980]  Blackberry. Yeah, basically all toast. So it's interesting because
[1:03:40.540 --> 1:03:47.860]  You know and that happened over the course of several years and of course Motorola is still technically I think now part of
[1:03:49.180 --> 1:03:53.980]  It's going to be part of Lenovo. That's what I don't know if that's actually finalized yet though
[1:03:53.980 --> 1:03:58.660]  I don't know that it has think so. I don't know but and then you know Nokia is part of Microsoft and
[1:03:59.460 --> 1:04:01.460]  HP price still owns the
[1:04:01.460 --> 1:04:06.100]  Rights to someday relaunch palm or something like that. Yeah
[1:04:06.740 --> 1:04:12.460]  and blackberry is still technically in business too, but you know you you see Samsung flying high and
[1:04:12.700 --> 1:04:17.500]  You know besides Apple the only truly profitable company and mobile and then all of a sudden
[1:04:17.980 --> 1:04:19.980]  Things are looking so great
[1:04:20.300 --> 1:04:22.700]  You know in the story that they're getting
[1:04:23.380 --> 1:04:29.140]  Kind of their butts kicked in in China and things aren't so great in India either where they supposedly
[1:04:29.140 --> 1:04:33.860]  You know had built such a great distribution system and that kind of stuff, and it's it's fascinating and and
[1:04:34.740 --> 1:04:39.380]  What in China they've been passed they've lost the number one spot for smartphones to?
[1:04:40.260 --> 1:04:42.260]  Xiaomi right I
[1:04:42.340 --> 1:04:47.740]  Guess you know, of course, that's a kind of thing that that it's probably close and it could probably change back
[1:04:48.740 --> 1:04:55.780]  But still yeah, and it's to be fair it's based on largely on third-party market share
[1:04:55.780 --> 1:05:00.980]  Some of these from companies like IDC, which I just linked to a few weeks ago about how
[1:05:01.540 --> 1:05:06.180]  Yeah, how made up some of their PC market share numbers have been over the years, you know
[1:05:06.180 --> 1:05:10.700]  But it's the best that we can go by but at the very least we're in there pretty you know
[1:05:10.700 --> 1:05:13.500]  I'm sure they're in the ballpark right, but sticking to facts
[1:05:13.500 --> 1:05:17.700]  We do know that financially Samsung has had reported a bad a bomb quarter
[1:05:18.500 --> 1:05:23.180]  Yeah, that's a fact so it's not out of the question that you know
[1:05:23.180 --> 1:05:29.540]  It seems like it it matches with that that they've lost momentum in China and then they've lost momentum in India
[1:05:29.780 --> 1:05:31.940]  Which is very different and we and I linked to
[1:05:32.820 --> 1:05:38.700]  Ben Thompson piece and a news report, you know, but about how different India is from China that we
[1:05:39.780 --> 1:05:41.420]  They call it the brick countries
[1:05:41.420 --> 1:05:46.060]  I've said this before and it's so weird to me, but it's Brazil, Russia, India and China
[1:05:46.060 --> 1:05:52.580]  But really all that those that they're you know that there's different economics from like Western Europe in the US
[1:05:53.140 --> 1:05:58.620]  But the thing that the only thing that those countries really have in common is that they're huge and then there's a lot of people in all of them
[1:05:58.820 --> 1:06:05.180]  But like India and China really can't be lumped together as one thing because economically they're so very different
[1:06:05.700 --> 1:06:09.500]  like there may be you know a billion poor people
[1:06:09.500 --> 1:06:14.700]  culturally and you know so many electronics are made in China that that was
[1:06:14.700 --> 1:06:23.660]  natural for for local Chinese companies to all of a sudden, but the biggest difference and Ben Thompson wrote about this was is that
[1:06:24.500 --> 1:06:26.500]  China has incredible economic
[1:06:28.620 --> 1:06:30.620]  What's it called inequality?
[1:06:30.900 --> 1:06:35.500]  Where yes, there are the poor people in China are very very poor by our standard
[1:06:35.700 --> 1:06:40.780]  But there's an awful lot of people who are some number of people in China who make, you know, I
[1:06:40.780 --> 1:06:48.340]  Have a little a very high income. It's spread tremendously and even if it's only a few percent a few percent of you know
[1:06:48.340 --> 1:06:56.740]  2 billion people in China is is tens if not hundreds of millions of people and in India the poor are even poorer and
[1:06:57.340 --> 1:07:04.260]  There's not as much income inequality where the people at the top aren't making as much as the the people in China
[1:07:04.260 --> 1:07:06.260]  And so it's a very different economic situation
[1:07:06.260 --> 1:07:07.180]  I
[1:07:07.180 --> 1:07:13.340]  Think the problem Samsung fail or the other thing that the Samsung is one I want to mention and I think I'd like to hear your thoughts on it is
[1:07:13.660 --> 1:07:20.740]  To me it ties in with the trend that I've noticed recently is that people have sort of shut up about Apple needs to make a cheap iPhone
[1:07:21.380 --> 1:07:25.700]  Which I think was part of a narrative that started about two two to three years ago
[1:07:25.980 --> 1:07:29.180]  Which was hey Samsung is gaining market share?
[1:07:30.700 --> 1:07:33.500]  Whether it was in the US or worldwide and smartphones and
[1:07:34.540 --> 1:07:36.540]  Android is you know
[1:07:36.540 --> 1:07:42.700]  Gaining even faster, but Samsung's gobbling up a huge part of it and that that there go apples and trouble and
[1:07:43.460 --> 1:07:47.460]  To the only way they can win back market shares with a cheap
[1:07:48.060 --> 1:07:49.900]  cheap iPhone
[1:07:49.900 --> 1:07:54.820]  Which is very different thing than a lower priced iPhone like just gently
[1:07:55.140 --> 1:07:58.860]  edging lower and lower into lower price points year over year
[1:07:59.260 --> 1:08:03.980]  That Apple needs to jump in head first with a cheap iPhone to stave this off and
[1:08:03.980 --> 1:08:10.740]  And cuz look Samsung's killing them Samsung is just or is growing too fast and now that Samsung's cooled off
[1:08:10.740 --> 1:08:12.740]  I think it coincides with people
[1:08:13.980 --> 1:08:21.660]  What was J. I wrote had a post on business insider maybe Apple knows what it's doing with the iPhone strategy after all something to that
[1:08:21.660 --> 1:08:23.580]  Yeah, totally, but it was just funny
[1:08:23.580 --> 1:08:26.740]  It's a funny headline and I know that the macelope made fun of it
[1:08:26.740 --> 1:08:30.860]  But it's in some ways it's actually a great head headline because it actually to me
[1:08:30.860 --> 1:08:37.820]  It encapsulates what I think a lot of analysts pundits and investors have actually are actually thinking I
[1:08:38.780 --> 1:08:44.340]  Think it's a little more nuance in that though because it's not just that Samsung
[1:08:45.020 --> 1:08:47.020]  the phone maker was
[1:08:47.740 --> 1:08:49.740]  Cleaning apples clock. It's that
[1:08:50.540 --> 1:08:52.540]  Android the platform
[1:08:52.940 --> 1:08:56.220]  Was you know if if market shares what you're going by
[1:08:56.220 --> 1:09:01.860]  Android has destroyed Apple period like it's you know, it's not even close
[1:09:01.860 --> 1:09:08.340]  It's not Windows Mac level, but it's like whatever 70-30 or something like that worldwide
[1:09:09.060 --> 1:09:11.060]  80-20 I don't know and
[1:09:11.980 --> 1:09:19.020]  The thinking was that you know if this is the new if this is the new OS platform war and
[1:09:19.020 --> 1:09:26.020]  and you know for the for the next 20 years or something like that then Apple can't afford to
[1:09:26.420 --> 1:09:31.500]  not be the dominant player there because this isn't just about phones
[1:09:31.500 --> 1:09:37.540]  This is about tablets and and you know all kinds of future devices and now extending to televisions and
[1:09:38.220 --> 1:09:42.140]  Probably not wearables and all that kind of stuff. So if Apple loses
[1:09:42.940 --> 1:09:46.620]  People's phones they've lost that that person's whole life
[1:09:46.620 --> 1:09:53.380]  And if you know if this is the new software platform for the next couple of decades, then that's that's potentially troublesome
[1:09:54.180 --> 1:10:01.900]  But I think we've seen that maybe you know that the market share advantage that Android has is a lot more splintered than
[1:10:02.260 --> 1:10:06.820]  The Western dominated Windows Mac war, you know like
[1:10:07.620 --> 1:10:10.860]  What's going on with Android and China is probably
[1:10:10.860 --> 1:10:19.020]  Pretty different than what's going on with Android in in Western markets, you know hardware and software wise and you know you have these
[1:10:19.940 --> 1:10:21.940]  these messaging companies
[1:10:21.940 --> 1:10:23.940]  that that catch on in
[1:10:24.460 --> 1:10:32.140]  Different markets and become really huge and popular and that kind of stuff and I don't know so maybe it's a dawning realization on more people that
[1:10:32.540 --> 1:10:34.540]  Market share isn't everything
[1:10:34.540 --> 1:10:40.580]  That it's not it doesn't trump every that mobile is different and that market share and mobile is different than it
[1:10:40.580 --> 1:10:42.580]  meant in the PC
[1:10:42.980 --> 1:10:49.900]  Platform yeah, and even as I've said before though even in PCs right the Mac still exists and by most by most accounts
[1:10:49.900 --> 1:10:57.740]  I've seen in terms of traditional PC not counting tablets just counting what we always thought of things with Intel CP is X86 CPUs
[1:10:57.740 --> 1:11:03.820]  Right laptops desktops running either windows or Mac or you know Linux that Apple
[1:11:04.540 --> 1:11:08.300]  Makes about 50% of the profit in the whole PC industry
[1:11:08.300 --> 1:11:16.300]  Yeah, by far and away number one in terms of the profit. They have in the PC industry in a what everybody would consider a
[1:11:19.100 --> 1:11:23.820]  Mature market a settled mature market, right? And I would say it's also
[1:11:24.780 --> 1:11:27.740]  Almost never now that you run into the to the real problem
[1:11:27.740 --> 1:11:33.900]  Which was that software existed for Windows but not for Mac right you could pretty much get whatever you want for Mac
[1:11:33.900 --> 1:11:40.100]  You know, obviously there's some stuff that's still games only games still it is still a different situation
[1:11:40.540 --> 1:11:45.340]  Right although mobile has kind of you know and the game consoles have kind of made PCs
[1:11:45.780 --> 1:11:53.060]  Less important for gaming. Yeah, I don't see people complain. I still think clearly windows PCs are but you know far more
[1:11:53.060 --> 1:11:56.180]  You know have more new titles and run things better
[1:11:57.300 --> 1:12:03.180]  Excel is still better for windows obviously but but I don't see people complaining about games on Macs anymore
[1:12:03.180 --> 1:12:08.020]  So much mainly because I think mobile is a bigger deal in consoles or a bigger you know bigger deal
[1:12:08.020 --> 1:12:15.780]  Yeah, but this was the big fear that you know if Android gets this this huge advantage and market share that all the sudden
[1:12:16.180 --> 1:12:24.540]  All the best apps are gonna be either Android first or Android only and you know is my reporting about a month and a half ago
[1:12:24.980 --> 1:12:27.300]  prove that's not the case like
[1:12:27.300 --> 1:12:33.940]  Android despite its massive market share lead is still either getting developed
[1:12:34.140 --> 1:12:42.940]  You know at the same time as iOS or after yeah, there are very few important apps that are Android first or Android only and
[1:12:44.620 --> 1:12:46.940]  You know, I don't know if that's gonna change it might
[1:12:48.220 --> 1:12:51.420]  But it doesn't look like it doesn't seem to be happening. No
[1:12:51.420 --> 1:12:58.260]  So so that you know, so that's what that whole market share slash platform war
[1:12:59.100 --> 1:13:03.740]  Argument was about and I know you know, that's what Jay was thinking because Jay and I were working together
[1:13:03.740 --> 1:13:10.620]  And we were talking about this stuff and that's you know and and Henry are you know our boss was the one who was the one writing that
[1:13:10.620 --> 1:13:14.620]  That the iPhone was dead in the water right for that right now
[1:13:15.180 --> 1:13:17.180]  on the argument that
[1:13:17.180 --> 1:13:24.060]  You know this platform war really really really mattered and that market share was key to to that
[1:13:24.060 --> 1:13:28.820]  And I think we're learning the mobiles a little different at least so far. I mean, you know
[1:13:29.580 --> 1:13:35.900]  No, no, no, so it's gonna happen in a few years. Well, I think the thing that's different is the post-internet world
[1:13:35.900 --> 1:13:41.140]  I think that's the thing that really like a lot of things happened between 95
[1:13:42.340 --> 1:13:44.540]  1994 95 and
[1:13:44.540 --> 1:13:47.140]  1998
[1:13:47.140 --> 1:13:56.140]  Which I think people confused in their head as meaning hey when you lose the market share war you go away you go by by and that a lot of people summed it up as
[1:13:57.100 --> 1:13:59.100]  in the back of their heads that
[1:13:59.740 --> 1:14:01.900]  Windows 95 came out and was
[1:14:02.420 --> 1:14:05.780]  either as good or good at least good enough as the Mac and
[1:14:06.740 --> 1:14:12.700]  People you know, I'm Windows 95 came out and people lined up around stores to get it at midnight
[1:14:12.700 --> 1:14:20.580]  Like they do for Apple products, right? It was that popular, right? I mean that's that's I mean just a good basic rule of thumb
[1:14:20.580 --> 1:14:21.740]  if you have
[1:14:21.740 --> 1:14:30.940]  Normal consumers lining up around the block to get into a store to buy your product. You've got something right Apple has that now Microsoft had it then and
[1:14:32.500 --> 1:14:37.100]  It you know it was a problem for Apple and but a big thing too was with the big
[1:14:37.100 --> 1:14:46.500]  Whether it was 90 to 10 95 five whatever the percentage split was between Windows and Mac PCs when you had to interchange stuff by floppy disk and
[1:14:46.980 --> 1:14:52.460]  They even even the floppy disks had different formats and if you put a Mac floppy disk into a you know
[1:14:52.460 --> 1:14:58.420]  Windows PC it would say do you need to reformat this and you'd lose everything on it and max eventually gain the ability to
[1:14:58.700 --> 1:15:06.780]  Read DOS formatted disks, but went Microsoft was never gonna bother supporting Mac formatted disks and the file formats weren't the same and if you had a
[1:15:06.780 --> 1:15:10.300]  Word document that was created in PC and you opened it Microsoft Word on your
[1:15:10.780 --> 1:15:15.180]  On your Mac and everything reflowed and then when you sent it back to people it was all screwed up
[1:15:15.340 --> 1:15:21.860]  It was all a problem and it was all didn't we buy some like $60 app to like just convert. Yeah, I forget the name
[1:15:21.860 --> 1:15:26.660]  That was great. Oh, it worked to charm. I forget the name of that. I know exactly what you're talking about
[1:15:26.860 --> 1:15:34.300]  But all those things but then the internet happened and or and then Apple got into financial problems and really was on the cusp of bankruptcy
[1:15:34.300 --> 1:15:38.340]  But not really so much just because of market share and problems on the Mac
[1:15:38.340 --> 1:15:41.740]  But just that the company was horribly run and that they'd had these failed
[1:15:42.460 --> 1:15:46.460]  Initiatives at an extra it was a far more complex story than just market share
[1:15:47.860 --> 1:15:49.860]  But the internet really
[1:15:49.940 --> 1:15:56.780]  Heeled over the whole hey, I'm using platform A and you're using platform B and we need to communicate and exchange stuff
[1:15:56.780 --> 1:16:03.740]  Right and that really helped I think it's not just Apple but anybody you know who wanted to come up with a new platform forever after is
[1:16:04.060 --> 1:16:11.180]  That you don't have to worry about I mean even just simple networking just getting a Mac and Windows computer on the same network in the early 90s was like
[1:16:11.780 --> 1:16:15.300]  Almost impossible and especially to have them both be treated as peers
[1:16:15.980 --> 1:16:20.580]  Whereas the internet is this open standard, you know involves all these open standards for networking
[1:16:20.580 --> 1:16:26.780]  Yeah, and even if you look at the native apps that are the most popular on Android and iOS
[1:16:26.900 --> 1:16:30.180]  They're all basically just interface code, you know
[1:16:30.900 --> 1:16:37.580]  Interacting with an API so even if you know Android gets some sort of you know market share advantage
[1:16:37.580 --> 1:16:43.180]  It's not that hard like people would build Windows apps and then not build a Mac app because it was
[1:16:43.940 --> 1:16:49.460]  in a lot of money and time and all this stuff and and documents and all that sort of everything you just described
[1:16:49.460 --> 1:16:54.860]  But the difference between building an iOS app and an Android app is mostly just interface code at this point
[1:16:54.860 --> 1:17:01.260]  Right, so in really broad terms conceptually the whole computing world is built on the foundation is now the internet
[1:17:01.620 --> 1:17:06.820]  Yeah, and it's you know not just the worldwide web TCP IP in general and HTTP
[1:17:07.540 --> 1:17:11.540]  It's the internet and then we all pick devices that run a certain platform and
[1:17:12.980 --> 1:17:14.180]  Connect to the internet
[1:17:14.180 --> 1:17:21.700]  Whereas pre-internet the foundation of the world was whatever operating system your computer was running and so if you were on a Mac
[1:17:21.900 --> 1:17:28.540]  The Mac OS and the ecosystem of Mac apps was the foundation of the computing world and for PCs
[1:17:28.540 --> 1:17:36.300]  It was Windows and Windows apps and that meant that they were not compatible. So I think in the modern world. It's it's it's it's just
[1:17:37.220 --> 1:17:43.580]  It's very possible not just for two platforms to co-exist and thrive like Android and iOS
[1:17:43.580 --> 1:17:49.100]  But you know could be could be three. I think it's unlikely that there'd be a slew that there'd be like ten different
[1:17:49.740 --> 1:17:52.460]  You know platforms for mobile devices that would thrive
[1:17:52.820 --> 1:17:59.020]  But yeah, we're seeing like third place now dip to you know what three percent of the market or four
[1:17:59.020 --> 1:18:02.360]  So yeah, it looks like a two-horse race at this point
[1:18:02.360 --> 1:18:09.540]  But I don't think it's inconceivable re-rolled the dice for the last six or seven years of the end you come up with an alternate universe where
[1:18:09.540 --> 1:18:16.820]  You know, maybe if it had come out a little sooner and it had more corporate support that palm OS, you know was still yeah, you know
[1:18:17.380 --> 1:18:23.140]  Six seven percent like a Mac-sized market and with good margins, you know, it's a good business
[1:18:23.620 --> 1:18:24.540]  Yeah
[1:18:24.540 --> 1:18:30.940]  But I think a lot of people looked at those you know that that Apple's near bankruptcy and and decided that you know
[1:18:30.940 --> 1:18:38.940]  Platform battle if you don't win you're gonna go bankrupt and don't really think about the fact that Apple came back and that that was a long time ago
[1:18:38.940 --> 1:18:45.260]  And it now that the market is mature the Mac business has been thriving for well over a decade consistently
[1:18:45.980 --> 1:18:54.700]  So by those lines the company then that may be in the greatest position of power is not necessarily the company that runs the
[1:18:55.100 --> 1:18:58.460]  OS but the company that runs those back-end services
[1:18:59.580 --> 1:19:06.780]  Which increasingly is Google yeah, and so but I'm also a little surprised by how
[1:19:06.780 --> 1:19:08.940]  Committed Google has been to
[1:19:10.300 --> 1:19:12.300]  Continuing to make stuff for iOS
[1:19:13.300 --> 1:19:17.300]  You know to the to the point that they would even sponsor your your website
[1:19:18.140 --> 1:19:25.260]  When they when they could theoretically say okay from now on our best stuff is is Android only and you know
[1:19:25.260 --> 1:19:29.740]  There's some like Google now. I think it's probably going to be a better experience in Android because yeah
[1:19:29.740 --> 1:19:33.260]  Well Google now's a unique example because it's really tied into the
[1:19:33.260 --> 1:19:38.540]  The right system, you know, the idea that you need to launch an app for it really defeats it really wants to be in that
[1:19:38.860 --> 1:19:47.500]  That gifted position that Siri is in yeah, so if that if that sort of feed its stream AI type thing is the future of
[1:19:48.620 --> 1:19:52.140]  You know mobile computing then that's the kind of thing where Apple
[1:19:52.860 --> 1:19:54.860]  Market share could be
[1:19:54.860 --> 1:20:00.220]  A problem right like like if you know unless Apple does a better job at that with Siri although you know
[1:20:00.220 --> 1:20:05.020]  I think for example, I think there were an R third party keyboard apps for
[1:20:05.420 --> 1:20:09.980]  iOS now, but they just run as an app and you know show their keyboard
[1:20:09.980 --> 1:20:14.220]  And you do your typing and copy and paste it and go back to another app and paste it into the app
[1:20:14.540 --> 1:20:21.260]  Which nobody's going to do like the only way you could really have a thriving market of third party keyboards for your OS
[1:20:21.420 --> 1:20:23.420]  Is if you really support them at the system level
[1:20:24.060 --> 1:20:27.260]  Like Apple's doing it on your own. I think that that's probably going to prove popular
[1:20:27.260 --> 1:20:32.860]  Whereas something like Google now isn't really going to have a chance to thrive unless Apple somehow made Siri
[1:20:33.180 --> 1:20:36.380]  That sort of thing where you could replace Siri with
[1:20:37.260 --> 1:20:39.260]  Google now or with
[1:20:41.020 --> 1:20:42.380]  Katana
[1:20:42.380 --> 1:20:46.940]  Yeah, I don't know if they would ever do that. Do you hear that? Just me talking made the iOS 8
[1:20:48.300 --> 1:20:50.940]  Hey Siri thing. I was wondering what that was
[1:20:51.980 --> 1:20:53.660]  That's funny
[1:20:53.660 --> 1:21:01.420]  Seems like I cut you off. Can you please repeat that? Yeah, it said that it heard me save replace Siri with and and she got upset
[1:21:02.140 --> 1:21:03.180]  Nice
[1:21:03.180 --> 1:21:10.860]  Yeah, so I wonder if there's a point at which Google you know sees the the market share in their advantage says all right
[1:21:10.860 --> 1:21:17.500]  Well, we're done doing Google Maps for iOS now or something like that, but it doesn't seem to be the direction they're going in
[1:21:17.660 --> 1:21:23.500]  Yeah, and as Microsoft in as Google sometimes old Microsoft in as Google sometimes is that doesn't seem to be the way
[1:21:23.500 --> 1:21:24.860]  They think
[1:21:24.860 --> 1:21:26.380]  That would be I
[1:21:26.620 --> 1:21:31.420]  Think there might be some people within Google who think that but I think that certainly the people making the iOS at
[1:21:31.660 --> 1:21:35.740]  S apps aren't would be and I and I think they're so scared of
[1:21:37.900 --> 1:21:43.500]  Antitrust stuff that they won't because yeah, you could really screw them up. Yeah, they had to
[1:21:44.300 --> 1:21:47.260]  chop themselves up so you know a public
[1:21:48.140 --> 1:21:49.660]  Seeming
[1:21:49.660 --> 1:21:55.180]  Support for iOS probably makes them look really good. Yeah in the same way that it did for Microsoft in
[1:21:55.500 --> 1:21:59.340]  1997 when they cut the deal with Apple and can get it to five years of
[1:21:59.980 --> 1:22:01.980]  You know office support and stuff like that
[1:22:02.220 --> 1:22:07.100]  Even more so because that Microsoft was already in the anti big antitrust trouble at the time right
[1:22:07.660 --> 1:22:13.180]  Yeah, yeah, that's something Google has to worry about that Apple doesn't because Google has at least one
[1:22:13.660 --> 1:22:15.660]  Monopoly which is on web search
[1:22:15.660 --> 1:22:22.140]  Yeah, and Chrome is starting to move in that direction to and well, I don't think
[1:22:23.340 --> 1:22:30.140]  Question, I don't think Chrome is ever going to get to monopoly size though. No, probably not but the other thing they're doing now and and
[1:22:31.980 --> 1:22:39.420]  I actually learned a lot about this on friday is that the the EU is like really looking into the way they're using
[1:22:39.900 --> 1:22:43.340]  Google plus as part of search results and
[1:22:43.340 --> 1:22:47.340]  I don't you know they made it just get a slap on the wrist
[1:22:47.340 --> 1:22:51.580]  But some other stuff might happen that they makes it really bad for them, so I don't know
[1:22:53.340 --> 1:22:54.540]  but
[1:22:54.540 --> 1:22:58.540]  So we'll see about that, but yeah, Google searches obviously their biggest well the EU
[1:22:58.540 --> 1:23:04.380]  I know the EU is largely skeptical and I do I had you know wouldn't be surprised at all
[1:23:04.380 --> 1:23:07.500]  And maybe I'd be more surprised if something big doesn't come out of it
[1:23:07.500 --> 1:23:11.180]  But just the general way that Google favors its own products and search results
[1:23:11.180 --> 1:23:17.180]  Yeah, that like if you're just getting worse and if you just type in I'm guessing
[1:23:17.180 --> 1:23:22.700]  I don't know I'm gonna go to google and just type if you type calendar software does it show you know suggest Google calendar
[1:23:23.660 --> 1:23:30.940]  And I know that like when you search for businesses they show Google plus results for that business in a it's not part of
[1:23:31.980 --> 1:23:35.500]  Doesn't show Google calendars at first result, but you know, I don't know
[1:23:35.500 --> 1:23:40.780]  But I know for you if you type like a restaurant name it it favors the Google plus page for that
[1:23:41.180 --> 1:23:43.020]  Oh, yeah, what if you just type calendar all right
[1:23:43.020 --> 1:23:47.180]  If you just type the word calendar in a Google the first result is Google calendar. Oh nice
[1:23:47.820 --> 1:23:51.420]  Well, I don't know is that nice. Oh, I don't know
[1:23:51.420 --> 1:23:57.340]  But I know that the EU is if you're Google. Yeah, so looks very ascanted that because that's what they would call
[1:23:58.540 --> 1:23:59.500]  Is it bundling?
[1:23:59.500 --> 1:24:02.060]  I don't know what the anti-trust term for it is
[1:24:02.060 --> 1:24:06.300]  But it's using it's exactly what Microsoft got in trouble with with windows. It's using
[1:24:06.940 --> 1:24:11.260]  You know that having a monopoly is not necessarily illegal and often isn't illegal at all
[1:24:11.500 --> 1:24:15.580]  But using that monopoly to gain an advantage in a different market is
[1:24:16.780 --> 1:24:20.780]  Right, and if they're using the Google search monopoly to promote Google plus
[1:24:21.740 --> 1:24:23.740]  unreasonably
[1:24:24.060 --> 1:24:30.380]  Against you know natural competitors then that could be problematic. So and not having a monopoly
[1:24:30.380 --> 1:24:34.940]  Gives Apple way more freedom than they would otherwise like there's probably
[1:24:35.820 --> 1:24:42.540]  An arms-length list of things that Apple is doing that if if iOS had 90% smartphone market share
[1:24:44.380 --> 1:24:50.860]  Would certainly oh, yeah certainly have the EU taking them to court and might even have the US Department of Justice
[1:24:50.860 --> 1:24:52.860]  which is even with
[1:24:53.180 --> 1:24:59.020]  You know Obama in the seventh year of his administration is far more business friendly than the EU
[1:24:59.020 --> 1:25:01.900]  Yeah, the app store itself
[1:25:03.340 --> 1:25:08.540]  Yeah, I think yeah, that's probably the prime example that the way that they run the app store and that there's no
[1:25:08.700 --> 1:25:12.380]  Sideloading of apps. It's probably that would probably be the central
[1:25:12.540 --> 1:25:14.540]  That would probably be the the big one
[1:25:14.620 --> 1:25:19.580]  That would probably be like the centerpiece of of illegal fight and I don't think they'd be able to win it
[1:25:20.300 --> 1:25:25.740]  Yeah, which things of I'm you know, I remember in the app store first launch that was kind of a lot of
[1:25:25.740 --> 1:25:31.900]  A lot of controversy, but people seem to have gotten used to it and you know with
[1:25:32.700 --> 1:25:35.420]  Test flight who knows you know in a couple years. There could be
[1:25:36.700 --> 1:25:39.980]  Side, you know more widespread sideloading of apps, but
[1:25:40.780 --> 1:25:44.940]  You know, but that would definitely be the thing and I've even seen people make the stupid argument
[1:25:45.020 --> 1:25:51.020]  Which is that Apple does have a monopoly they have a monopoly on the OS for iPhones, but that's yeah, it's not a monopoly
[1:25:51.900 --> 1:25:53.100]  Yeah
[1:25:53.100 --> 1:25:57.380]  Is anyone is anyone running Android can you crack an iPhone and run Android on there?
[1:25:57.380 --> 1:26:03.540]  I don't think so I've seen people try and maybe there was like once or twice a long time ago where somebody got something vaguely working
[1:26:03.540 --> 1:26:06.900]  But it's not a thing. Well, you cannot
[1:26:08.620 --> 1:26:11.860]  So back to Samsung I think that
[1:26:12.980 --> 1:26:16.460]  The other thing that we're really seeing is that Samsung has
[1:26:17.300 --> 1:26:21.500]  They've done a great job and they've obviously had a good good couple of years
[1:26:21.500 --> 1:26:30.580]  But that there it's increasingly becoming obvious that they're getting pinched on both sides that Apple still dominates or maybe not dominates
[1:26:30.580 --> 1:26:36.220]  But certainly has a long-term a sustained advantage at the high end of the smartphone market like the
[1:26:36.780 --> 1:26:41.020]  multi-hundred price to hand sets that Apple still sells a majority of those
[1:26:41.700 --> 1:26:48.260]  Which is historically where the profits are yeah where the profits are and at the low end at the lower price
[1:26:48.260 --> 1:26:51.700]  And where Apple doesn't compete at all, they're increasingly
[1:26:52.420 --> 1:26:54.900]  losing to companies like Xiaomi and
[1:26:55.340 --> 1:27:00.100]  You know other ones that a lot of us even here in the US haven't even heard of or don't even have access to
[1:27:01.180 --> 1:27:05.700]  But certainly that's that's been a problem for them in China and that is you know
[1:27:05.700 --> 1:27:07.700]  That's where their market share is eroding
[1:27:08.140 --> 1:27:15.540]  Right now and those get you know people to look at Samsung stuff and then maybe even buy a higher end thing or something like that
[1:27:15.540 --> 1:27:19.900]  Right and you lose the advantage to to maybe you know, maybe it's not high margin
[1:27:19.900 --> 1:27:26.020]  But you know low margin times a big number still equals a lot of money. Yeah, yeah, you know
[1:27:26.020 --> 1:27:32.620]  You lose that advantage and then all the scale advantages that come with all that and yeah, you know
[1:27:33.660 --> 1:27:37.780]  You know the post I published that you link to obviously was a little tongue and cheek
[1:27:37.780 --> 1:27:45.260]  You know here's Samsung's future stock chart, and it was the Nokia chart from the day that iPhone
[1:27:45.660 --> 1:27:47.660]  Launched to the day that
[1:27:47.980 --> 1:27:52.740]  Microsoft bought Nokia, so which looks like a ski downhill ski slope
[1:27:53.540 --> 1:28:01.540]  I don't think that's the future for Samsung. I mean, it's a huge conglomerate and they do so much more stuff than
[1:28:01.540 --> 1:28:10.620]  Then I think Nokia did you know ranging from TVs to the chips that go into other phones and that kind of stuff. So and
[1:28:11.300 --> 1:28:13.940]  they've proven I don't see them collapsing, but
[1:28:14.820 --> 1:28:19.700]  It doesn't look great either. All right. They've proven to be more nimble than Nokia
[1:28:19.900 --> 1:28:27.300]  But I don't know if they're nimble enough and it's it's that right. They don't really have good footing in this market, you know
[1:28:27.300 --> 1:28:36.620]  We're I think Apple does and I think company like Xiaomi does and maybe even I know Ben Thompson is is a big
[1:28:39.300 --> 1:28:47.180]  Is bullish on Lenovo once they you know finish the Motorola app acquisition and then Lenovo might do real really well in China
[1:28:48.900 --> 1:28:56.580]  And other places just you know nipping you know 5% here 6% there 7% to another company and all of a sudden the low end is
[1:28:56.580 --> 1:29:02.980]  Is bifurcated and maybe is a lot more like the PC market where there's now all of a sudden Apple has a
[1:29:03.180 --> 1:29:07.580]  You know 5-inch iPhone and and maybe you don't need to buy that galaxy note
[1:29:07.580 --> 1:29:14.900]  So right the last few years, you know to compare the smartphone market and the PC market the last few years have been sort of like
[1:29:15.460 --> 1:29:22.100]  You know if one PC maker just had a enormous market share of windows, you know
[1:29:22.100 --> 1:29:27.580]  60 70% of windows sales like raw Dels that would be really good for Dell
[1:29:27.580 --> 1:29:30.580]  But that's not how the PC market is the PC market, you know, I think
[1:29:31.020 --> 1:29:37.260]  The number one spot has moved around a lot, but it's never been more than like 20% for HP or
[1:29:38.780 --> 1:29:45.460]  Del or any anyone company and it's you know you quickly get into that long tail where there's all sorts of you know
[1:29:45.460 --> 1:29:51.460]  No-name companies making really cheap machines and it's all split up and it's as we can see
[1:29:51.460 --> 1:29:55.500]  There's no, you know, there's there's no money to be made in a market like that
[1:29:56.260 --> 1:30:00.900]  Like nobody else other than Apple is making big money in PCs and it might soon be that no
[1:30:00.900 --> 1:30:04.420]  No other company than Apple is making big money in in mobile handsets
[1:30:05.180 --> 1:30:07.700]  Right, and there's nothing locking Samsung
[1:30:08.260 --> 1:30:14.300]  customers into Samsung the way that there would be and they've tried to you know, I tried to make their own
[1:30:15.580 --> 1:30:17.580]  music and I think
[1:30:17.580 --> 1:30:23.620]  I don't know if they ever did their own app store, but they yeah, they have music. They do have that kind of stuff and
[1:30:24.420 --> 1:30:30.780]  None of that really caught on I think in large part because they're not very good at software. Yeah
[1:30:31.700 --> 1:30:39.100]  And also Google has pressured all the Android companies to you know kind of promote Google play and not
[1:30:39.700 --> 1:30:44.780]  You know at risk of losing all the Google Google support, so right
[1:30:44.780 --> 1:30:48.980]  I think Google has made it such that Samsung really doesn't have that much
[1:30:49.860 --> 1:30:52.060]  to lock people into right
[1:30:52.060 --> 1:30:55.780]  I think then I think they're obviously aware of it because there's no other reason that ties in
[1:30:56.220 --> 1:30:58.220]  their own software platform
[1:30:58.740 --> 1:31:01.620]  Even exists, but I like you said, they're just not good at it
[1:31:01.620 --> 1:31:07.360]  And if they're not even good at making apps for Android I mean how good are they gonna be it making an entire platform and
[1:31:08.420 --> 1:31:11.500]  It's such an uphill battle. I mean you look I mean Microsoft
[1:31:11.500 --> 1:31:14.700]  We know is good at making platforms and good at making
[1:31:16.060 --> 1:31:22.780]  Developer tools and develop as creating developer API's can't get much traction in the market and can't get
[1:31:23.340 --> 1:31:25.340]  first-class support from
[1:31:25.340 --> 1:31:30.820]  Third-party developers the way that Android and iOS have well then how is Samsung going to do it with an all-new platform
[1:31:30.900 --> 1:31:36.060]  Right because it's not just good enough even if they made a version of ties in that was
[1:31:36.540 --> 1:31:40.420]  Objectively speaking good enough, you know like as good as Android
[1:31:40.420 --> 1:31:45.580]  It's that alone doesn't mean that they would get an app store full of third-party apps
[1:31:46.660 --> 1:31:48.260]  Right it's
[1:31:48.260 --> 1:31:51.180]  Totally and then even if they don't then it's dead in the water
[1:31:51.180 --> 1:31:54.060]  It you know to borrow the Henry's phrase. It really would be yeah
[1:31:54.060 --> 1:31:58.580]  I mean because look at my Microsoft has been trying to even pay companies to
[1:31:58.940 --> 1:32:02.380]  Make Windows phone apps and that's been such an uphill battle
[1:32:02.900 --> 1:32:07.140]  All right as it is I think they do you know that to close the loop on this it up
[1:32:07.140 --> 1:32:10.900]  It really makes it just seem even how much more
[1:32:11.940 --> 1:32:18.020]  Impressive and unlikely it was for Apple to succeed such so strongly because
[1:32:18.940 --> 1:32:22.460]  They weren't making mobile phones before and they weren't making
[1:32:23.420 --> 1:32:27.860]  Touch-based operating systems and app stores and all that kind of stuff. It was
[1:32:28.380 --> 1:32:35.460]  It's kind of nuts how well they've done. Yeah, and and the you know the profit margins and all that sort of stuff and not just pieces of it
[1:32:35.460 --> 1:32:40.660]  But all of it like it's the iPhone really is a lot more, you know, for all the praise
[1:32:40.660 --> 1:32:44.020]  It's gotten it really is more even more impressive than it seems
[1:32:45.020 --> 1:32:49.180]  Yeah, I totally agree and I think that it's the way that they made it look easy
[1:32:49.620 --> 1:32:55.900]  Keep makes it easy to overlook that. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just looking here. So Instagram. This is one example
[1:32:55.900 --> 1:32:59.840]  But Instagram for Windows phone debuted eight months ago. So early
[1:33:01.020 --> 1:33:03.020]  2014 but
[1:33:03.020 --> 1:33:08.500]  Instagram for Android came in March 2012. So two years after Android they came out with a Windows phone version and
[1:33:08.980 --> 1:33:13.780]  Instagram was rather famous for being iOS only for what seemed like a long time
[1:33:13.900 --> 1:33:17.420]  Seemed like the Android version took a you know took them a long time to get to
[1:33:17.900 --> 1:33:22.920]  Right, and I remember reading that it was Nokia that actually got them to
[1:33:23.340 --> 1:33:26.140]  To do a Windows version not even Microsoft
[1:33:26.140 --> 1:33:33.580]  Hmm, it was that they were impressed by the cameras on Nokia hardware so they went went and build a Windows phone
[1:33:33.580 --> 1:33:38.860]  Right, so just repeat that over and over again with everybody and then you know filter that down to the smaller
[1:33:39.100 --> 1:33:45.700]  Developers, you know the true indie shops where it's just a handful of developers and designers and you're just not going to get
[1:33:45.700 --> 1:33:48.980]  You're just they're just you're not gonna get the support because they're all writing
[1:33:49.820 --> 1:33:52.620]  iOS and and Android apps now
[1:33:52.620 --> 1:33:57.140]  Yeah, I should look at the blackberry app store and see what's going on there right now
[1:33:57.140 --> 1:34:01.500]  I bet a lot of people have abandoned, you know the companies that had made apps
[1:34:02.500 --> 1:34:07.700]  Even at the beginning of it might not be doing that anymore like I wonder if there's an updated
[1:34:08.260 --> 1:34:11.380]  Yeah, MLB app this year. I don't even know
[1:34:11.980 --> 1:34:15.100]  Yeah, maybe but I wonder. Yeah, I don't even know about that
[1:34:15.900 --> 1:34:18.700]  I used to be I have a bit of a
[1:34:18.700 --> 1:34:23.020]  FU. I know it's most podcasts do the FU at the beginning follow up. I
[1:34:23.660 --> 1:34:29.340]  Should mention this actually. I guess we should well. There's still that bad for blackberry. Look at that. Look at the app at 2014
[1:34:29.740 --> 1:34:36.380]  Yep, yeah, I actually have better some good stories behind that. I wonder if it runs on does it run on both platforms though
[1:34:36.380 --> 1:34:38.380]  Is it just for the old
[1:34:38.540 --> 1:34:40.540]  Blackberry or does it run on the blackberry 10
[1:34:41.420 --> 1:34:45.180]  Because it's two different platforms blackberry 10 huh, so there you go
[1:34:45.180 --> 1:34:50.780]  But you must purchase the device specific version of at bat 14 from the blackberry world
[1:34:51.580 --> 1:34:53.580]  To access it on blackberry 10
[1:34:53.580 --> 1:34:56.460]  I don't know what that means, but I think cool
[1:34:56.460 --> 1:35:01.260]  I think you have to tell them exactly which blackberry model you have because there's two entirely different platforms
[1:35:02.180 --> 1:35:04.740]  Anyway, my FU is when I had
[1:35:05.340 --> 1:35:07.340]  Moltz on the show last episode
[1:35:07.980 --> 1:35:12.900]  I was saying how I can't believe people in today's world would by polarized sunglasses
[1:35:12.900 --> 1:35:15.700]  because you make sure iPhone look crazy and
[1:35:17.620 --> 1:35:20.420]  You know, I've ever seen that you have polarized
[1:35:21.060 --> 1:35:23.060]  Yeah, I have to take them off. Yeah, screens look crazy
[1:35:23.060 --> 1:35:27.700]  I can't see how the screen looks different too. I like the I've had and the iPhone have different effects
[1:35:27.700 --> 1:35:30.500]  Well, I you I heard I got an earful
[1:35:31.220 --> 1:35:33.860]  from the fans of polarized sunglasses and
[1:35:34.820 --> 1:35:39.740]  And to summarize I don't want to stay out, but apparently if you buy quote goods polarized sunglasses
[1:35:39.740 --> 1:35:47.500]  It shouldn't be a problem that it says that's only a function of bad polarized sunglasses if you get expensive ones that are good
[1:35:48.380 --> 1:35:52.380]  Your iPhone will look good only when you hold the iPhone and it's natural
[1:35:53.980 --> 1:35:57.260]  Portrait orientation when you hold it sideways then you get the problem
[1:35:57.980 --> 1:36:02.220]  But so apparently it is possible to use an iPhone with polarized sunglasses
[1:36:02.220 --> 1:36:09.420]  So my apologies to fans of polarized sunglasses in the polarized sunglasses industry
[1:36:10.220 --> 1:36:17.020]  I don't know where mine are actually remember. That was the first time you we met you you put my sunglasses on and you were
[1:36:17.340 --> 1:36:19.340]  Shocked at how dirty they were
[1:36:19.900 --> 1:36:24.460]  Why didn't put yourself? Oh, I know why because I was thinking about I was thinking about their Ray bands
[1:36:24.460 --> 1:36:26.460]  and I was thinking about getting a pair and
[1:36:26.940 --> 1:36:29.420]  I asked you if it was on the roof deck at the
[1:36:29.420 --> 1:36:37.740]  Yeah, the Mac world. No, no the the deck the Mac world deck. No, it was in New York. No, no
[1:36:37.740 --> 1:36:44.380]  No, what's it? SF. Yeah, it was oh, it was a mackerel pronounced party. Oh, I thought it was the the deck book reading
[1:36:45.180 --> 1:36:47.980]  No, I didn't I didn't get to go to that. You didn't go. Oh
[1:36:49.420 --> 1:36:57.340]  That was a different time. I know each time by your time about kudos. Yeah baseball book. Yeah, I say did the deck but no, not the baseball book
[1:36:57.340 --> 1:37:03.740]  It was the oh the field tested book. Yeah field tested books where people have read is the first time I met you
[1:37:03.740 --> 1:37:06.380]  That's not I didn't know those sunglasses back then. All right
[1:37:07.020 --> 1:37:11.660]  Anyway, that is the first time we met that yeah field tested books was a thing that could all used to run
[1:37:11.660 --> 1:37:14.940]  Where he'd ask people to write you'd write a review of a book
[1:37:16.060 --> 1:37:18.060]  Where you read it and so
[1:37:18.940 --> 1:37:22.220]  Just a brilliant idea right and so you it really makes a difference
[1:37:22.220 --> 1:37:28.300]  All right, like if you remember that I read this one book when I was at this one place then that's the that was field tested
[1:37:28.300 --> 1:37:30.140]  Books and it made it it was fascinating
[1:37:30.140 --> 1:37:35.420]  I thought and I had written one and they held a book they had a held a reading in New York and and you were there
[1:37:35.820 --> 1:37:39.260]  Was a lovely event. It was true. Yeah. It was great. I still had that book somewhere
[1:37:39.660 --> 1:37:43.100]  Wonder where yeah, yeah, they had collected them into a book
[1:37:44.060 --> 1:37:46.060]  Anyway, I I
[1:37:46.220 --> 1:37:50.140]  Don't know where my sunglasses are they're over on the somewhere else. Well, I polarized
[1:37:50.140 --> 1:37:54.060]  I remember them being very very our polarized, so I actually want I and they're clean too
[1:37:55.020 --> 1:37:59.820]  Hold on give me two seconds. I'm gonna find them they're right down there next to me. All right, go leave for him
[1:37:59.820 --> 1:38:03.820]  And I'm gonna read the I'm gonna do a third sponsor. Yeah, play background music now
[1:38:03.820 --> 1:38:07.020]  I'm gonna take this opportunity while Dan is hunting down
[1:38:07.980 --> 1:38:14.280]  His polarized sunglasses to tell you back. All right, well, I'm taking this opportunity to tell people about transporter file
[1:38:14.280 --> 1:38:16.280]  Oh, please do great
[1:38:16.280 --> 1:38:21.040]  Another repeat sponsor you've probably heard me talk about them before if you're a regular listener
[1:38:21.040 --> 1:38:23.800]  But if you are or if you haven't short version
[1:38:24.360 --> 1:38:28.600]  Think about it as your own personal drop box. What you do is you buy devices
[1:38:28.600 --> 1:38:33.520]  You buy your own device from file transporter. It's a thing. You buy it. It's a gadget. You plug it in
[1:38:34.120 --> 1:38:36.320]  You connect it to your home network
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:43.040]  And you install some software on your Mac and all of a sudden you've got a folder in your home folder that
[1:38:43.040 --> 1:38:48.760]  That syncs to the device and then any other device in your house any other Mac in the house
[1:38:50.320 --> 1:38:55.320]  You can get a folder and it'll do that too. So it's just like Dropbox you have a folder you put files
[1:38:55.320 --> 1:38:58.840]  They sync to the device you can access them from anywhere
[1:38:59.680 --> 1:39:09.160]  The difference is it's your stuff your data is actually stored only on your file transporter device and it drives
[1:39:09.160 --> 1:39:14.600]  You connect to it. So they're right there in your house or in your office. You can buy more than one you can keep one at your house
[1:39:14.600 --> 1:39:16.600]  one at your office
[1:39:16.600 --> 1:39:18.800]  Put one in your parents house put one in your house
[1:39:18.800 --> 1:39:23.040]  And they just if you sign them into the same account, they sync the same data between them
[1:39:23.320 --> 1:39:28.200]  But at no point does your data go to a server on the cloud
[1:39:30.400 --> 1:39:32.640]  Interesting for privacy reasons especially
[1:39:33.560 --> 1:39:38.560]  You know it's given that the the allegations that have come out over the last two years
[1:39:38.560 --> 1:39:42.760]  About what government agencies around the world have been doing to big cloud providers
[1:39:45.160 --> 1:39:50.960]  Also interesting from a legal perspective for certain people in certain industries where you legally are obligated not to put
[1:39:51.160 --> 1:39:55.440]  Devices or data on to devices that you don't actually have physical control over
[1:39:57.240 --> 1:39:59.240]  Really interesting
[1:39:59.240 --> 1:40:04.720]  And I think really appealing to a lot of people whether it's for legal reasons or just privacy reasons
[1:40:04.720 --> 1:40:08.000]  Or just the desire to have control over your own stuff
[1:40:10.040 --> 1:40:12.040]  They have two types of devices
[1:40:12.240 --> 1:40:14.240]  they have
[1:40:14.560 --> 1:40:16.560]  The regular transporter
[1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:24.120]  This comes in 500 gigabyte one terabyte and two terabyte capacity. So that's a thing you buy already has a hard drive in it
[1:40:24.120 --> 1:40:26.120]  You just buy it plug it in
[1:40:26.720 --> 1:40:32.880]  And there's also the transporter sync. That's I call it the puck model. It's just like a little Apple TV puck
[1:40:32.880 --> 1:40:38.680]  Maybe even smaller provides the exact same functionality, but instead of coming with a hard drive you just
[1:40:39.840 --> 1:40:41.840]  You just plug in
[1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:48.080]  Your own USB drive anything with the USB port you any kind of third-party hard drive with a USB port
[1:40:48.200 --> 1:40:51.200]  You plug that in on your own. So if you have a bunch of hard drives
[1:40:51.800 --> 1:40:58.960]  Sitting around or you're already you know have a big one that you want to use you can just buy the transporter sync save some dough and just plug in your own hard drive
[1:40:58.960 --> 1:41:01.960]  Uh, here's the URL go to file
[1:41:03.040 --> 1:41:05.600]  Transporter store dot com file
[1:41:06.080 --> 1:41:13.280]  www dot file transporter store dot com now if you want to buy the transporter you can use this code TTS 10
[1:41:13.280 --> 1:41:18.120]  That's the one that comes with the built-in hard drive. You'll save 10% off your purchase
[1:41:18.120 --> 1:41:22.800]  That's up to 35 bucks for the two terabyte version which costs 350
[1:41:22.800 --> 1:41:31.800]  So you'll save 35 bucks just by using that code TTS 10 the talk show 10 TS 10 TTS 10 if you buy
[1:41:32.520 --> 1:41:37.360]  The sync the little puck model use this code TTS 20
[1:41:37.920 --> 1:41:44.360]  TTS 20 that doesn't save you a percentage just saves you 20 bucks just 20 bucks right off the top of the
[1:41:45.200 --> 1:41:49.720]  Sync model TTS 10 for that one TTS 20 TTS 10
[1:41:49.720 --> 1:41:56.400]  For the transporter TTS 20 for sync would have been easier if they just use one code and
[1:41:58.040 --> 1:42:00.880]  Make it work for both, but don't worry about it. You'll figure it out
[1:42:00.880 --> 1:42:03.800]  You're smart enough to buy a transporter. You're smart enough to use the right code
[1:42:04.760 --> 1:42:07.760]  Everybody who uses either one of those codes gets free shipping
[1:42:08.280 --> 1:42:13.760]  So if you're wondering if transporter would write for you go check it out see for yourself and
[1:42:13.760 --> 1:42:18.800]  And you can buy one and start using it and you have a 30-day risk-free
[1:42:19.360 --> 1:42:22.360]  Satisfaction guarantee. You don't like it use it for a couple of weeks

[1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:34.280]  My thanks to them
[1:42:34.280 --> 1:42:41.560]  All right guys shades on I do and so I have four screens in front of me. I have a MacBook Air
[1:42:41.560 --> 1:42:49.680]  I have a iPhone 5 I have a iPad mini and I have this Nexus 7 and they all behave differently with these sunglasses
[1:42:50.640 --> 1:42:57.840]  Some of them work portrait, but not landscape some of them work landscape, but not portrait some work both and some work
[1:42:58.720 --> 1:43:00.720]  Dagg everything but diagonal
[1:43:01.800 --> 1:43:03.480]  So who knows
[1:43:03.480 --> 1:43:08.960]  Well, I do think it's interesting that the iPad mini and the iPhone 5 have different screens
[1:43:08.960 --> 1:43:14.080]  Well, meaning what when you look at your iPhone 5, what do you see? Well, I see a green
[1:43:15.080 --> 1:43:19.320]  As if you had put a green gel over my glasses, so it's terrible
[1:43:19.920 --> 1:43:24.200]  Right, and it doesn't matter whether you hold it sideways or not. No, no, no, if you turn sideways it works fine
[1:43:24.200 --> 1:43:26.200]  But that's landscape
[1:43:26.200 --> 1:43:28.200]  Well, it's almost like two-thirds
[1:43:29.520 --> 1:43:33.360]  Two-thirds diagonal where the colors are better. Well, that's no good
[1:43:33.360 --> 1:43:37.520]  Nobody uses their phone at two-thirds diagonal. No, right, so it's not great
[1:43:37.520 --> 1:43:45.520]  But the iPad mini literally looks totally normal with my sunglasses on so there's in both orientations
[1:43:46.040 --> 1:43:47.520]  well
[1:43:47.520 --> 1:43:49.440]  mostly portrait
[1:43:49.440 --> 1:43:52.800]  But not in landscape landscape. It's a little darker, right?
[1:43:53.320 --> 1:43:59.640]  But either way there's so all that mythology about how they just cut the same screen out of the
[1:44:00.160 --> 1:44:04.520]  Yeah, no, I think we've gotten away from that. I think that's yeah, I don't think that's right
[1:44:04.520 --> 1:44:08.920]  I yeah, because they also laminate the screen to the glass differently
[1:44:09.560 --> 1:44:11.560]  like they they still have another
[1:44:12.160 --> 1:44:18.200]  You know, whatever 16th of an inch. They can make this iPad skinnier if they that way it was written some of that space
[1:44:18.200 --> 1:44:22.400]  It was most obvious. I thought and I realized that that's that I
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  Propagated that and and it's because they've stuck to it was a simplistic thinking that because they've stuck to these
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:35.320]  Same pixel resolutions, you know in the pre retina world. There were only two two pixel resolutions
[1:44:35.320 --> 1:44:38.160]  You know pixels per inch the iPhone one which was like
[1:44:39.120 --> 1:44:43.080]  162 or 163 and the iPad one which was 133 and
[1:44:43.400 --> 1:44:49.320]  They all their iOS devices were one of those two pixel resolutions and then in the retina world it just doubled that it was like
[1:44:49.320 --> 1:44:52.240]  you know, it's 320 something 323 and
[1:44:52.240 --> 1:44:58.080]  267 pixels per inch and every device has one of those pixels per inch thing
[1:44:58.280 --> 1:45:03.160]  But it's it's that's and there might be some economies of scale to sticking with that
[1:45:03.160 --> 1:45:07.560]  But obviously certain devices have different ones. I thought the most obvious was when they came out with the
[1:45:08.280 --> 1:45:10.280]  the iPhone 5
[1:45:11.200 --> 1:45:18.400]  Coming up on two years ago and the still today current because they didn't update it last year the iPod touch that had the
[1:45:18.880 --> 1:45:20.880]  16 to 9 aspect ratio and
[1:45:20.880 --> 1:45:27.920]  It's you know real lightweight and thin device. You know the one the metal the current iPod touch the one that has the camera strap thing and everything
[1:45:29.080 --> 1:45:34.000]  Because the same new screen size same pixel per inch resolution
[1:45:34.200 --> 1:45:35.520]  But the
[1:45:35.520 --> 1:45:40.640]  Saturation and colors on the iPod touch is just nowhere near the quality of the iPhone 5
[1:45:41.520 --> 1:45:47.360]  And similarly with the iPad air and the iPad mini the iPad air has such
[1:45:47.360 --> 1:45:52.240]  Noticeably more vivid color than the mini. Yeah, I think so too
[1:45:52.240 --> 1:45:57.880]  Which as a mini owner? I never noticed but then when I had them side by side. It was pretty shocking
[1:45:57.880 --> 1:46:03.760]  Yeah, I don't I think the mini might have better quality than the iPod touch, but it's definitely not up to the iPod
[1:46:03.760 --> 1:46:07.240]  iPad air is like it's crazy. Yeah
[1:46:07.960 --> 1:46:10.400]  I don't I guess cuz that's a bigger battery or something
[1:46:10.720 --> 1:46:16.280]  Yeah, but anyway the polarized sunglasses. I don't mean to make a terrible pun but apparently it's a very
[1:46:16.280 --> 1:46:18.280]  Polarizing
[1:46:18.440 --> 1:46:19.480]  topic
[1:46:19.480 --> 1:46:21.480]  Yeah, it's a shady
[1:46:21.480 --> 1:46:23.480]  I
[1:46:23.480 --> 1:46:28.040]  Think the moral of the story is if you're getting if you're going sunglasses shopping bring your phone
[1:46:28.040 --> 1:46:33.320]  Yeah, and see what works. Yeah, and take a look at your phone in the when you buy it when you buy the sunglasses
[1:46:33.600 --> 1:46:34.600]  Right
[1:46:34.600 --> 1:46:37.400]  Yeah, there's amazon hash it
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:41.720]  Is that it is it hash it hash it? I think it's a shit has shut
[1:46:41.720 --> 1:46:48.360]  Yeah, where I am is on it and has shed the one of the five major book publishers
[1:46:49.680 --> 1:46:56.520]  Are in a continuing spat that they're taking public and and there's then a author's united
[1:46:57.160 --> 1:47:02.360]  Movement between which you know again. It's not unanimous certainly not that all authors are even all
[1:47:03.560 --> 1:47:06.120]  Successful authors are on has shut side
[1:47:06.760 --> 1:47:11.040]  Definitely not the case, but there's a lot of authors who are see it on the publisher side
[1:47:11.040 --> 1:47:19.520]  And an amazon launched a sort of hamfisted readers united site which really wasn't united by readers
[1:47:19.520 --> 1:47:21.840]  It was entirely by and written by amazon
[1:47:22.720 --> 1:47:28.760]  But more or less by they're making the case that it's in reader's interest for amazon to come out on top of this because
[1:47:30.880 --> 1:47:32.880]  Books will be books will be cheaper
[1:47:33.240 --> 1:47:37.120]  But it's boy. It's an ugly fight. It is and I well
[1:47:37.120 --> 1:47:42.480]  I think it's ugliest to those of us who are somewhat exposed to it
[1:47:43.440 --> 1:47:47.480]  I don't know if both people are even though it's happening. Well, I don't know though
[1:47:47.480 --> 1:47:50.880]  I think people are noticing more and more though because of things like
[1:47:52.400 --> 1:47:57.240]  Hash it books not coming out on amazon or at least not being available pre-order on amazon
[1:47:57.800 --> 1:48:05.040]  With true, you know, and for I don't know what 14 or 17 years. I don't know however long amazon's been selling books
[1:48:05.040 --> 1:48:09.240]  There's an awful lot of us who've just you know if you hear about a new book
[1:48:09.240 --> 1:48:17.200]  And it's coming out you just go to amazon to start typing the book title and you can either buy it if it's shipping or it says send me this when it comes out and
[1:48:18.200 --> 1:48:23.280]  I think the biggest problem is that no one knows which label their book is gonna be on
[1:48:23.280 --> 1:48:32.440]  It's right. It's just confusing. I think it's like when a certain movie studio gets pulled from iTunes or something or from Netflix or whatever
[1:48:32.440 --> 1:48:38.960]  You don't know that it's missing for that reason. Yeah, or even when it's one that you kind of know
[1:48:38.960 --> 1:48:48.120]  Like I probably a lot of people would know that Star Wars is 20th Century Fox because everybody remembers that the 20th Century Fox fanfare before the Star Wars
[1:48:48.480 --> 1:48:54.520]  Song theme, right or like everyone knows Pixar is Pixar or something like that. Yeah, and that they're owned by Disney now
[1:48:54.680 --> 1:48:57.560]  Yeah, certainly. I think that's pretty that's another good common one
[1:48:57.560 --> 1:49:03.760]  But nobody really thinks of that in time in terms of am I going to be able to watch this like you never had to
[1:49:03.760 --> 1:49:09.040]  Why can the old days when we go to blockbuster to rent a movie? You never thought well shit
[1:49:09.040 --> 1:49:12.400]  I want to watch the unforgiven, but that's that's Warner Bros
[1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:16.520]  and the war you know and then blockbuster doesn't have Warner Bros movies
[1:49:17.480 --> 1:49:22.840]  So I guess I have to go to that other Hollywood video. Yeah, where the Warner brothers are, you know, and yeah
[1:49:22.840 --> 1:49:26.920]  So yeah, that part of it is is and I would say with books
[1:49:26.920 --> 1:49:34.680]  It's even less so because it's those fanfarers that make that stick in my mind. I mean that's I'm pretty sure the unforgiven is is
[1:49:35.680 --> 1:49:37.680]  Warner Brothers
[1:49:37.680 --> 1:49:39.680]  But I certainly remember, you know
[1:49:40.720 --> 1:49:47.160]  There's a lot of movies where I remember the fanfare I saw before it whereas the little tiny publisher stamp on books boy
[1:49:47.160 --> 1:49:54.240]  I don't I don't know many books that I know which which of the big five publishers published it. No, definitely not so I
[1:49:54.840 --> 1:50:02.680]  Don't know it I have trouble taking sides here even as a you know potential someday book author like I
[1:50:03.320 --> 1:50:09.000]  Don't I don't I don't think I know enough about what's going on and that's the thing is I don't think anyone has actually said what their
[1:50:09.800 --> 1:50:15.760]  Specifically disagreeing about like it's vaguely has to do with pricing for ebooks or something like that
[1:50:15.760 --> 1:50:18.760]  Wait, yeah, it's who gets to pick the price of ebooks. Yeah
[1:50:18.760 --> 1:50:24.280]  Really is it the but like the details matter and I don't think anyone's actually revealed what the details are
[1:50:24.840 --> 1:50:30.880]  That I've seen. I don't know right Amazon wants them to be capped at $9.99 and you know
[1:50:31.640 --> 1:50:38.040]  Hash it in the other book publishers want to be able to sell new titles, you know at whatever price they want
[1:50:38.040 --> 1:50:47.920]  You know it is it's pretty complicated and it's you know if and with subscription coming into play now
[1:50:47.920 --> 1:50:49.920]  It's gonna get screwed up again
[1:50:51.240 --> 1:50:53.240]  Yeah, totally gonna get screwed up again
[1:50:53.600 --> 1:50:57.440]  You know go back to the early days of Netflix streaming when they were
[1:50:58.240 --> 1:51:03.800]  Less than two good movies to watch like that's that's what the book street book rental
[1:51:03.800 --> 1:51:11.400]  Book subscription services look like now. Yeah, imagine how that's gonna have to go through all all kinds of crap now. Yeah
[1:51:12.480 --> 1:51:14.480]  There's a long
[1:51:14.960 --> 1:51:17.720]  article that I haven't posted it during firewall yet
[1:51:17.720 --> 1:51:20.920]  I probably will by the time this that by the time this podcast comes out
[1:51:21.880 --> 1:51:26.360]  Tomorrow to probably already have posted it but it I haven't posted it because I haven't finished reading it yet by
[1:51:26.560 --> 1:51:28.560]  Guy and Christopher Wright who is an author
[1:51:28.560 --> 1:51:32.560]  And he kind of it's a big long argument
[1:51:32.560 --> 1:51:35.440]  But it's cut I think it has to be long because it's complicated sometimes
[1:51:35.600 --> 1:51:38.680]  You know when I write an article it ends up real long
[1:51:38.680 --> 1:51:45.160]  I think am I am I just spouting off or am I is it just that complex that it takes a lot of words to describe it?
[1:51:45.160 --> 1:51:48.240]  And I think in this case is article as long because it is complex
[1:51:49.640 --> 1:51:51.080]  Which is mostly that you know?
[1:51:51.080 --> 1:51:53.680]  Hash it is really not looking after readers or authors
[1:51:53.680 --> 1:51:56.520]  They're looking after their own interests and Amazon isn't really
[1:51:56.520 --> 1:52:02.760]  You know doing anything for the benefit of anybody else than Amazon and that's just the way it is and so whoever wins
[1:52:02.760 --> 1:52:06.240]  It's it's not really going to be a victory for anybody
[1:52:06.240 --> 1:52:12.000]  But hash it or Amazon and it's probably going to be Amazon anyway because hash it really doesn't have Amazon's the one up
[1:52:12.320 --> 1:52:16.680]  You know in a position of strength and the big thing is that the downside
[1:52:16.800 --> 1:52:22.040]  You know the reason that may not be good for us as readers or even us as authors
[1:52:22.400 --> 1:52:25.040]  You and I for Amazon to win
[1:52:25.040 --> 1:52:30.800]  Isn't because lower prices are bad because Amazon has a good or you know a couple of good arguments
[1:52:30.800 --> 1:52:35.320]  And they're just common sense one is that an e-book should be cheaper than a paper version because it
[1:52:35.760 --> 1:52:41.520]  Duh it's cheaper to send bits than it is to cut down trees turn them into paper and print a book
[1:52:42.560 --> 1:52:50.520]  And even Amazon has made this argument that because you have fewer rights with a digital version in e-book because it's locked by DRM and
[1:52:50.520 --> 1:52:55.200]  You can't resell it. You can't give it to somebody else. I can't you know you can take it
[1:52:55.200 --> 1:53:00.320]  If you buy a paper book, I can read it and then sell it to somebody else. You can't do it with any book and
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:06.760]  I thought it was interesting that Amazon which is you know the company putting the DRM on the books is even making the argument that hey
[1:53:06.760 --> 1:53:08.760]  This makes them less valuable
[1:53:08.760 --> 1:53:10.760]  And therefore they should cost less
[1:53:10.760 --> 1:53:12.120]  I
[1:53:12.120 --> 1:53:16.600]  Think that's a common sense argument and it makes sense same way that a paper back should cost less than a hardcover
[1:53:16.600 --> 1:53:20.280]  Addition because it's not as nice and it didn't cost as much to make
[1:53:21.400 --> 1:53:29.880]  And they also make the argument Amazon that it's you know in in terms of like authors and royalty that they've shown through their own
[1:53:29.880 --> 1:53:31.880]  Analysis of data that
[1:53:31.880 --> 1:53:33.800]  in general
[1:53:33.800 --> 1:53:37.640]  Like a book that is an e-book that's selling for $15
[1:53:38.120 --> 1:53:40.280]  $14.99 of course, but call it 15
[1:53:40.280 --> 1:53:46.520]  We'll sell X number of copies that at the same book at $10 $9.99
[1:53:47.400 --> 1:53:53.000]  Would sell like 1.7 times as much and therefore make more money and
[1:53:53.720 --> 1:54:01.800]  Get 70% more readers so you'd have more readers and you'd make more money because it would be more than the 1.5 that you would need to break even
[1:54:03.720 --> 1:54:09.000]  But that the big downside to the whole thing if if Amazon wins and they probably will is that
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:17.480]  They're building an effect of monopoly on on e-books and that it'll be ripe for abuse and you know everybody will be at Amazon's
[1:54:19.640 --> 1:54:27.640]  Liberty in terms of you know e-book once they lock down the market and I guess another missing part of the equation is what percentage of
[1:54:28.200 --> 1:54:31.240]  Revenue and profits are still coming from
[1:54:31.240 --> 1:54:38.200]  $30 hardcover books that you know you need to still somewhat justify the price for yeah
[1:54:38.920 --> 1:54:43.480]  Without $10 e-books. Yeah, one thing I've seen and I've seen a lot of people could be
[1:54:44.440 --> 1:54:49.880]  The analogy to that there's a lot of people are the people on the side that it did they should definitely be cheaper
[1:54:49.880 --> 1:54:51.880]  It may be even a lot cheaper e-books
[1:54:52.520 --> 1:55:00.920]  A lot of them are drawing on the analogy that paperbacks are relatively new to the book industry and I guess they they came to be popular in
[1:55:00.920 --> 1:55:02.920]  the 1930s
[1:55:05.320 --> 1:55:10.520]  It's not quite the same though the analogy that it's like a third tier like that used to just be hardcover
[1:55:10.760 --> 1:55:15.480]  Additions and then it was hardcover on paperback and now it's hardcover paperback and e-books
[1:55:16.520 --> 1:55:19.880]  The difference that I see though is one of like what do you call them?
[1:55:21.560 --> 1:55:26.840]  Frames, you know the like opening weekend what do you call that oh windows windows right yeah
[1:55:26.840 --> 1:55:30.920]  But that you know the way that to my knowledge that you know
[1:55:31.880 --> 1:55:36.600]  The major book publishers have worked is that new books only come out in hardcover
[1:55:36.600 --> 1:55:38.360]  Like when Stephen King comes out with a new book
[1:55:38.360 --> 1:55:42.440]  It doesn't come out in hardcover and paperback at the same time and you can choose to save
[1:55:42.600 --> 1:55:49.600]  You know half the price by buying the paperback if you want it when it's new like when the new Harry Potter books came out and people lined up at midnight
[1:55:49.720 --> 1:55:51.720]  To buy them you had to buy the hardcover
[1:55:51.800 --> 1:55:55.720]  Which was the more expensive version and that the paperback came out it was like home
[1:55:55.720 --> 1:56:01.160]  You know the same way that you can't buy most movies at the opening weekend you have to wait
[1:56:01.880 --> 1:56:03.880]  to get them and
[1:56:04.120 --> 1:56:09.320]  e-books don't seem to be like that people want to get like if Stephen King has a new book and you want to read it on your
[1:56:09.320 --> 1:56:11.880]  Kindle you get it on the same day that the hardcover comes out
[1:56:13.080 --> 1:56:18.360]  Yeah, I think there was a period where they were trying to not have that available, but I think that that
[1:56:19.480 --> 1:56:21.480]  That's done, you know
[1:56:21.480 --> 1:56:28.440]  And I kind of see how you know that the publishers I kind of see if in the publisher's perspective that they should have a right to charge a premium
[1:56:28.520 --> 1:56:32.600]  While demand is at a premium, you know that when the right you know and again
[1:56:32.600 --> 1:56:35.320]  You can say whether just gouging their the die hard fans
[1:56:35.320 --> 1:56:41.320]  But you know that's what pays to keep you know the books coming out like I think if you really want to read it in a opening weekend
[1:56:41.320 --> 1:56:45.720]  You want to read that new you know Stephen King novel as soon as it comes out
[1:56:45.720 --> 1:56:51.400]  They should be allowed to charge $17 for it and then you know drop the price to $9.99 in
[1:56:51.800 --> 1:56:57.000]  The long run, you know three months later six months later like same thing like with movies coming out on home video
[1:56:57.840 --> 1:57:00.160]  Yeah, and so many markets work like that
[1:57:00.800 --> 1:57:04.320]  You know and that demand is not necessarily gouging like it's
[1:57:05.400 --> 1:57:08.360]  Being the among the first to get something is
[1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:13.480]  To many people worth more money right because you know if you know if you're you know
[1:57:13.480 --> 1:57:17.920]  Not that hell bent on reading it right away or you already have a big stack of books in front of you
[1:57:17.920 --> 1:57:21.720]  To you know that are waiting you to read and you can wait and you know you're gonna pay a lower price
[1:57:22.600 --> 1:57:25.960]  Same way that you know it kind of works like that on iTunes
[1:57:25.960 --> 1:57:27.600]  I don't know if it's on purpose
[1:57:27.600 --> 1:57:33.800]  But so many new releases are only available for purchase and then you can't rent them for you know
[1:57:33.800 --> 1:57:38.160]  Whatever another month. There's something. Yeah, they always tell you know available for rent on you know
[1:57:38.160 --> 1:57:43.440]  Subtember 26 I've found myself buying movies that I don't actually want to own
[1:57:44.400 --> 1:57:47.920]  Because I don't want to wait a month before they're four bucks, right?
[1:57:47.920 --> 1:57:52.040]  But and then with a lot of other movies. I've found myself saying I don't want to buy this
[1:57:52.040 --> 1:57:56.880]  I know I just ran it and I'll add it to my wish list. I'll come back to it. You know when it comes out for rent
[1:57:57.200 --> 1:57:58.400]  Yeah, I've done the same thing
[1:57:58.400 --> 1:58:01.040]  We're like there's some movies where I want to see it right away
[1:58:01.040 --> 1:58:05.720]  And I know that maybe I'll only watch at once, but I'll pay the $14.99 to buy it
[1:58:05.720 --> 1:58:12.360]  Yep, yeah, so I kind of see the you know the thinking there. I I'm guessing I
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:19.680]  Think like in those rentals. I know Apple has limits on that, but I you know in some movies some and some movies too
[1:58:19.680 --> 1:58:23.600]  They cost more to rent, you know, there's there's new additions that I've seen at
[1:58:24.360 --> 1:58:28.800]  I cost 5.99 to rent and I think there's sometimes with the ones that are still in theaters
[1:58:28.880 --> 1:58:34.960]  It's 6.99 to rent it. Yeah, I think one was like 10 bucks. Yeah, so I think Apple gives the
[1:58:34.960 --> 1:58:40.320]  You know the the studios or whoever it is, you know, if it's like an independent motion picture
[1:58:40.320 --> 1:58:46.000]  Whoever controls the rights to the movie they give them some pricing control on the rental and purchase price and
[1:58:46.480 --> 1:58:48.280]  That's the big thing that sticks
[1:58:48.280 --> 1:58:53.760]  I think in a lot of the publishers cross with Amazon is that Amazon wants to
[1:58:54.160 --> 1:58:58.400]  Just have unilateral control over the price of their stuff
[1:58:58.400 --> 1:59:01.560]  And that's it is how Amazon's App Store works
[1:59:01.560 --> 1:59:08.520]  You can like set like a suggested price, but if I am when you have an app in the Amazon store if they decide they want to sell it for 99 cents
[1:59:08.520 --> 1:59:10.520]  They just sell it for 99 cents
[1:59:10.720 --> 1:59:12.720]  And you get your 30% of that
[1:59:13.240 --> 1:59:18.080]  And I you know it hasn't had a big effect on the app industry because the Amazon App Store is
[1:59:19.240 --> 1:59:26.520]  Relatively small player in mobile apps, but in terms of ebooks, you know the Kindle store is dominant probably you know
[1:59:26.520 --> 1:59:32.520]  I'm an Appley yeah, although it's not a monopoly. I think I think in legal terms
[1:59:32.520 --> 1:59:34.520]  It's a monopsony
[1:59:34.520 --> 1:59:41.480]  Right, which is different and confusing, but I think has different it might give them a lot more leeway in terms of
[1:59:42.320 --> 1:59:44.880]  Antitrust laws, you know and that whole weird
[1:59:45.400 --> 1:59:52.320]  Thing that frustrated a lot of us with the Apple ebooks case which has cost them hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees
[1:59:52.320 --> 2:00:02.240]  Where Apple which at a sliver of the e-book case is the company that got taken to court by the department of justice and lost hundreds of millions of dollars in
[2:00:02.480 --> 2:00:03.920]  fees for
[2:00:03.920 --> 2:00:06.640]  colluding with the the book publishers and
[2:00:07.200 --> 2:00:12.160]  Amazon the company that has the monopsony the overwhelming majority
[2:00:13.280 --> 2:00:15.280]  of e-book sales
[2:00:15.280 --> 2:00:22.240]  Uh, you know is under no as as and received any scrutiny at all. Here's the dictionary definition. Great work guys
[2:00:22.880 --> 2:00:26.560]  Monopsany a market situation in which there is only one buyer
[2:00:27.280 --> 2:00:32.800]  Right, and that's because that's the thing is that it's not that they have a monopoly on books sales because there's these five
[2:00:32.880 --> 2:00:34.880]  Publishers that have all the you know
[2:00:35.360 --> 2:00:41.600]  It's that they sell the books not really directly to the customer. They sell them to Amazon and Amazon resells them to people
[2:00:41.600 --> 2:00:46.400]  And that they're really effectively without Amazon. There is no e-book market
[2:00:46.400 --> 2:00:49.840]  I don't know if that's quite true to say, but it would be interesting to see
[2:00:49.840 --> 2:00:55.720]  I've seen very different percentages from very different people when they've published like how many of their book sales come from
[2:00:55.720 --> 2:00:59.200]  Amazon e-book sales come from Amazon versus iTunes and
[2:01:00.240 --> 2:01:02.240]  Cobo and and who else
[2:01:02.240 --> 2:01:04.240]  whoever else Sony
[2:01:04.440 --> 2:01:06.440]  nook yeah, yeah
[2:01:07.200 --> 2:01:08.400]  Yep
[2:01:08.400 --> 2:01:13.920]  Anything else what else you got? Oh, I'm you know, I've just been enjoying the summer
[2:01:15.600 --> 2:01:19.840]  I've been you know getting in the weeds on a few topics
[2:01:20.800 --> 2:01:23.280]  I think my best post last week was about how
[2:01:24.400 --> 2:01:26.400]  AOL still has a
[2:01:26.720 --> 2:01:29.840]  Large profitable dial-up business saw that
[2:01:29.840 --> 2:01:38.560]  It's actually I think one of the more interesting posts. I've done recently was looking at Google apps and how
[2:01:39.360 --> 2:01:42.000]  Successful they've been at stealing
[2:01:43.120 --> 2:01:46.000]  the start-up and growing
[2:01:46.960 --> 2:01:48.960]  the kind of midsize company
[2:01:48.960 --> 2:01:59.840]  Ranks that you know should be Microsoft customers for exchange and and all their enterprise stuff and you know Microsoft is effectively betting the company on the cloud and
[2:02:00.640 --> 2:02:02.160]  I saw that
[2:02:02.160 --> 2:02:07.400]  Yeah, I saw that and that wasn't an interesting post. Yeah, so you what you did is
[2:02:08.240 --> 2:02:13.840]  You guys looked at the MX records. Yeah, so I picked 150 companies
[2:02:13.840 --> 2:02:24.000]  So the 50 the fortune 50 so the biggest 50 companies by market cap right isn't that how the fortune 50s something like that
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:28.880]  Yeah, I think it's market cap. It's either market cap or or revenue. I think it's market cap
[2:02:29.360 --> 2:02:31.360]  and then
[2:02:31.360 --> 2:02:40.520]  50 companies from the last why combinator class those were like the startups the tiniest companies and then this mid-level tier which were
[2:02:40.520 --> 2:02:48.360]  Very scientifically chosen. They were the first 50 companies that I thought of that were mid-sized
[2:02:49.880 --> 2:02:51.880]  ranging from Tesla to
[2:02:52.600 --> 2:02:56.760]  So they were public and private companies including Dropbox Twitter
[2:02:57.640 --> 2:03:02.280]  Tesla, I don't have the list in front of me, but but companies like that. Yeah, yeah
[2:03:02.840 --> 2:03:06.920]  and of the of the hugest companies, you know the ones that that were
[2:03:06.920 --> 2:03:10.680]  You know, stereotypical enterprise companies
[2:03:11.400 --> 2:03:15.320]  Of those 50 only one of them used Google
[2:03:16.440 --> 2:03:19.240]  Apps for their email and that was Google
[2:03:21.160 --> 2:03:25.160]  You know what I thought there. I laugh, but when I was reading the article
[2:03:25.160 --> 2:03:30.760]  I remember thinking oh, I wonder what the one is. Yeah, and I swear to God and then you say it was Google
[2:03:30.760 --> 2:03:32.760]  I was like ah
[2:03:32.760 --> 2:03:38.680]  It was like the ultimate it was a type of trick question where I pride myself on being able to think oh, it's got to be Google
[2:03:39.240 --> 2:03:46.600]  And I did not get that. Well, and you know, there's caveats like maybe some wing of one of these companies uses Google apps
[2:03:46.600 --> 2:03:53.720]  for some stuff or maybe you know, maybe everyone uses their personal Gmail at the office, but it's it's a fair test though
[2:03:53.720 --> 2:03:59.720]  I think yeah, it was it was universally, you know, I looked up the MX records for 150 companies and
[2:03:59.720 --> 2:04:09.000]  And and so the you know the startup the Y Combinator. I think it was like all but four or six of them used
[2:04:10.440 --> 2:04:14.680]  Google that's a little surprising to me too, because that it was that high. I mean, it's not
[2:04:15.720 --> 2:04:17.720]  92% so it's like all but
[2:04:19.240 --> 2:04:22.840]  I don't know because it's not that hard to you know
[2:04:24.920 --> 2:04:26.920]  46 so all but four of them
[2:04:26.920 --> 2:04:28.920]  um
[2:04:28.920 --> 2:04:34.040]  Use Google and I think one of them might have been used so outlook was showing up in these results
[2:04:34.600 --> 2:04:36.760]  Occasionally so like the you know theoretically
[2:04:37.160 --> 2:04:39.160]  Microsoft's answer to
[2:04:39.720 --> 2:04:41.720]  Google apps would be cloud-based
[2:04:42.040 --> 2:04:49.320]  Outlook, so that was showing up and it's some of them. I'm I'm a little surprised it was as high as 92% because it's not that hard to run your own
[2:04:49.320 --> 2:04:57.800]  Mail server, you know, with like a way you run like a you know that you get a lot of it for free from like a web host and sign up for
[2:04:57.800 --> 2:05:01.720]  Whatever dream host or something. Yeah, and they'll run your I map for you
[2:05:02.440 --> 2:05:09.880]  I'm a lot of those web hosts have been kicking that off to Google because it used to be free and because that's a huge
[2:05:10.200 --> 2:05:11.720]  you know
[2:05:11.720 --> 2:05:17.440]  Monkey off their back because hosting emails probably not fun for any of those companies in terms of support
[2:05:17.440 --> 2:05:20.640]  And I'm also surprised maybe it just speaks to my mindset
[2:05:20.640 --> 2:05:25.760]  But I'm a little surprised that a lot of those companies wouldn't switch off even if they were using it
[2:05:26.080 --> 2:05:29.200]  When they were at the three guys in a garage stage that they didn't
[2:05:29.840 --> 2:05:35.120]  Switch off once they could eat you know hire like a salesman that they wouldn't say hey
[2:05:35.120 --> 2:05:37.120]  Let's run our own mail servers for the paranoia
[2:05:38.240 --> 2:05:44.240]  aspect of that an offer right of those companies have negotiated with Google for like hey
[2:05:44.240 --> 2:05:48.960]  Maybe Google wants to acquire us or maybe we need to work with them and do you really trust Google?
[2:05:50.320 --> 2:05:53.440]  Not yeah, or even security stuff like do we trust Google to
[2:05:54.320 --> 2:06:00.080]  Right continue so the most interesting part though was the those mid-tier companies and that's where
[2:06:01.040 --> 2:06:09.120]  60% of them used Google apps and that includes Twitter includes both drop box and box both of them use
[2:06:09.920 --> 2:06:11.920]  Google
[2:06:11.920 --> 2:06:16.960]  For their email and those are you know as I wrote in the piece like those would be
[2:06:18.160 --> 2:06:21.360]  Potential competitors even you know like drop box
[2:06:22.480 --> 2:06:25.920]  Already probably has a and box, you know has pretty good
[2:06:27.040 --> 2:06:32.000]  Enterprise sales for their storage services, so maybe they should offer email hosting too who knows
[2:06:34.240 --> 2:06:40.480]  But that was really surprising so it's not that you know Microsoft still has a huge hold over the biggest
[2:06:40.480 --> 2:06:46.880]  Enterprise customers, but the the the growing companies, you know the Microsoft's future
[2:06:47.440 --> 2:06:49.440]  customers seem to be
[2:06:49.840 --> 2:06:51.840]  Really sticking with Google, so
[2:06:53.040 --> 2:06:59.280]  We'll see you know Microsoft still has I think like 90% of the revenue in that in the email hosting market
[2:06:59.840 --> 2:07:05.920]  Think that's what they told me something around that range or maybe 95% and now it's because Microsoft are
[2:07:05.920 --> 2:07:13.200]  What's it called IBM Lotus also still has some so maybe it was like 80% Microsoft, but it's still very strong
[2:07:14.320 --> 2:07:16.320]  Dominating position
[2:07:16.640 --> 2:07:19.520]  But revenue is not important to Google. They're not in the email
[2:07:20.160 --> 2:07:25.680]  Apps business for the money. They're doing it for the control. All right, you know the money
[2:07:26.160 --> 2:07:29.600]  Google gets all the money they need from search advertising
[2:07:29.600 --> 2:07:35.680]  Which is well, but I do think though. I because everybody knows that they
[2:07:36.720 --> 2:07:40.320]  Don't they I mean they've admitted I mean they'd say that they they scan your email to show
[2:07:42.160 --> 2:07:47.600]  Contextual ads right related generates money and and from like I you know
[2:07:48.560 --> 2:07:52.880]  Being able to scan your email to get your to build their profile of you
[2:07:54.240 --> 2:07:58.880]  Is got to be a huge source of accuracy for the the targeted ads that they show
[2:07:58.880 --> 2:08:05.040]  True and the fact that you're logging in for your email means you're logged in right while you're doing searches
[2:08:05.040 --> 2:08:11.040]  Right, but even beyond that like my understanding is that they actually are running Google Apps as a business now
[2:08:11.200 --> 2:08:13.920]  Like they're not trying to lose a lot of money on it
[2:08:15.120 --> 2:08:18.520]  Which is one of the reasons they got rid of the free tier and that kind of stuff
[2:08:19.040 --> 2:08:27.480]  So you know, it's it's still I think less than 10% of I think 90% of Google's revenue is still advertising, but it's still I
[2:08:27.480 --> 2:08:31.640]  Think 10 I think now other is 10% or something like that. So
[2:08:32.440 --> 2:08:36.840]  Growing yeah, but it was interesting. It was you know, I would you know
[2:08:36.840 --> 2:08:40.520]  I was in the command line like searching mx records and I would see
[2:08:40.920 --> 2:08:47.560]  Wow, this big ass company is still using Gmail. That's pretty pretty crazy. Yeah, and I think that there's a
[2:08:49.160 --> 2:08:54.600]  It's hard to make a man understand something that his job depends on him not understanding sort of angle to
[2:08:54.600 --> 2:09:03.480]  You know once a company all everybody had to have email at some internet-based email at some point in the 90s
[2:09:03.720 --> 2:09:06.360]  It became just it's you know as essential as having
[2:09:06.920 --> 2:09:08.920]  telephone lines into your company and
[2:09:09.240 --> 2:09:13.080]  For a lot of them they might have already had internally mail based on you know
[2:09:13.080 --> 2:09:15.080]  I don't know whatever antiquated Microsoft
[2:09:15.560 --> 2:09:20.680]  Our loadest crap that they had and then had installed gateways to the internet and it was all convoluted and crazy
[2:09:20.680 --> 2:09:26.200]  But it all required a big large IT staff and then doing it doing anything
[2:09:26.360 --> 2:09:32.280]  Like when you're a startup not having anybody who has to worry about the email server is great because you
[2:09:32.520 --> 2:09:37.400]  You know you can concentrate on the thing that is you're trying to build and you can save on your head count
[2:09:37.400 --> 2:09:41.000]  And it really matters even if it's just one person because you're leaning meaning you're starting
[2:09:41.080 --> 2:09:45.080]  Whereas if you're already the IT staff with a full-time IT job
[2:09:45.080 --> 2:09:49.560]  But you know proctor and gamble or something like that you're not going to make decisions on what
[2:09:49.560 --> 2:09:55.320]  Products and services to buy based on well now we can we can get rid of us. We can get right right
[2:09:55.320 --> 2:09:57.320]  We can make this choice that would
[2:09:57.480 --> 2:09:59.480]  Obviate the need for our jobs
[2:09:59.640 --> 2:10:03.800]  Totally. Yeah, and it's so many of those enterprise deals are you know
[2:10:04.200 --> 2:10:05.480]  Yeah, you get an exchange server
[2:10:05.480 --> 2:10:07.000]  We also get
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:10.440]  Office license for everyone in the company and windows and all the stuff
[2:10:10.440 --> 2:10:14.840]  So it's a huge deal that's beyond the scope of just emailing and outlook
[2:10:15.800 --> 2:10:18.280]  But you know the companies that are starting as
[2:10:18.280 --> 2:10:22.600]  Three-person startups now and are growing into so some of the company
[2:10:22.600 --> 2:10:25.320]  I just pulled up the the spreadsheet some of the companies that
[2:10:26.040 --> 2:10:32.440]  Are still Google customers, you know, we're less than 10 people a few years ago, and those are like Airbnb
[2:10:36.280 --> 2:10:42.680]  Warby Parker Tumblr, you know, all these companies are still using Google apps despite the fact that they are
[2:10:43.480 --> 2:10:47.800]  Worth billions of dollars. It's an it is tumbler. Yeah, isn't that kind of crazy?
[2:10:47.800 --> 2:10:49.800]  If you think about it be given that their own by Yahoo
[2:10:50.680 --> 2:10:53.720]  Yeah, and well, they've also maintained a pretty
[2:10:54.360 --> 2:10:58.520]  Yeah, but that's still a little crazy like they still have their own office a little crazy, but yeah tumbler
[2:11:00.600 --> 2:11:04.280]  Uh a bunch of boring like Etsy does
[2:11:05.320 --> 2:11:09.880]  You know in one of those things too where it's there's no real
[2:11:09.960 --> 2:11:14.040]  It's not that you can't migrate, but it's a pin in the ass because yeah, you know
[2:11:14.040 --> 2:11:20.600]  You've got to somehow download all of your email from Google and put it somewhere and then upload it to the other
[2:11:20.600 --> 2:11:24.360]  You know give you if like for example tumbler wanted to switch to Yahoo mail or something like that
[2:11:25.160 --> 2:11:30.840]  And the truth is without one. I think I looked up what Yahoo itself uses, but I'm I would bet that it's not gmail
[2:11:31.080 --> 2:11:32.120]  All right
[2:11:32.120 --> 2:11:37.400]  Yeah, I would guess not but on the other hand too is the simple fact that gmail is
[2:11:37.960 --> 2:11:41.080]  Objectively better than Yahoo mail and you know
[2:11:41.080 --> 2:11:47.160]  It's a good sign. I guess it shouldn't be that surprising. It's a good sign that tumbler is allowed to stay on gmail
[2:11:47.160 --> 2:11:52.200]  You know it wasn't by yeah by edict forced to do it because it would have been a shit sandwich to everybody at tumbler
[2:11:52.200 --> 2:11:58.800]  It's like right. Yeah, we're going to Yahoo nothing's going to change also your email is going to be Yahoo mail is like
[2:11:59.800 --> 2:12:01.800]  You know I quit
[2:12:03.720 --> 2:12:07.080]  What about beats music is on oh good question
[2:12:07.080 --> 2:12:11.880]  That's a really good question up now. No, don't look it up now, but that's be a good follow-up
[2:12:12.520 --> 2:12:16.440]  Yeah, there you go because I wonder if they're on gmail. I wonder if that would be I think apples
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:20.760]  Are they still on exchange at Apple? I don't know. No, I don't think they use exchange
[2:12:20.760 --> 2:12:25.720]  I think they're just like simple, you know straight straight unix. I'm app
[2:12:26.680 --> 2:12:30.760]  I think could be I could look at the headers from an email. Yeah, I know
[2:12:30.760 --> 2:12:36.040]  That's it. I don't know if that's here. Here's an email from Apple. Oh
[2:12:36.920 --> 2:12:39.480]  Apparently the eye watch is coming on September 9th
[2:12:41.560 --> 2:12:43.560]  Where's the show headers? Oh?
[2:12:43.560 --> 2:12:46.920]  I see Oracle communications messaging server. Yeah
[2:12:47.880 --> 2:12:49.880]  So that's not exchange. No
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:57.560]  Yeah, that's what I see too Oracle communication messaging server. All right, so there we go good. There you go Oracle
[2:12:57.560 --> 2:13:04.440]  Yeah, it's Larry Ellison. It's can you imagine how that deal got done?
[2:13:05.640 --> 2:13:07.880]  Yeah, there's a there was a yacht involved
[2:13:09.240 --> 2:13:11.240]  two people yeah
[2:13:11.960 --> 2:13:14.520]  You're moving your email to Oracle
[2:13:16.200 --> 2:13:19.880]  Anything else what else you got cubs are are decent again
[2:13:21.800 --> 2:13:25.640]  What are they I've missed that if that's true? No, they're well there in last place
[2:13:25.640 --> 2:13:31.640]  But they just called up the number one prospect and so he he hit a game-winning home run his first day
[2:13:32.760 --> 2:13:36.600]  His first major league hit was a game-winning home run. What is it? What's position does he play?
[2:13:37.240 --> 2:13:39.960]  I think he's playing second. I think he's a shortstop
[2:13:41.320 --> 2:13:46.440]  Yeah, I've heard about him. So I've been watching the games and it's finally exciting. They're they're not gonna be good
[2:13:47.240 --> 2:13:49.800]  probably for a year or two
[2:13:49.800 --> 2:13:56.280]  I'm guessing 2016 you got they have a shot you got faith though. You think they're in a well. No, I mean come on
[2:13:56.280 --> 2:13:58.840]  I've I've now gotten to the point where I'm
[2:13:59.800 --> 2:14:05.960]  Just you know, we'll see what show me the actual world series like and I'll see like when they were in the NLCS
[2:14:05.960 --> 2:14:12.280]  I was still very skeptical. You know when you grow up with this you're like and it's kind of spread over in the
[2:14:13.080 --> 2:14:15.160]  Kind of how I see all kinds of stuff, but just
[2:14:15.960 --> 2:14:17.800]  We'll see what we'll see when it actually happens
[2:14:17.800 --> 2:14:22.600]  But it's you know exciting to watch because they used to love watching games and they've just been so bad for so long
[2:14:22.600 --> 2:14:25.400]  That I haven't even bothered. I didn't even sign up for
[2:14:26.200 --> 2:14:28.200]  MLB TV this year until
[2:14:28.440 --> 2:14:30.840]  Last week, so do you get a discount on that?
[2:14:31.800 --> 2:14:37.880]  Uh, no because I did the monthly which I think is always gonna be the same price, but if you sign up for the year
[2:14:38.520 --> 2:14:40.520]  I don't know, but
[2:14:40.520 --> 2:14:41.640]  You should
[2:14:41.640 --> 2:14:44.440]  Yeah, well, it's great. Well, it's a fantastic deal for me
[2:14:44.440 --> 2:14:49.320]  I've said this over and over. I mean if your favorite team is out of town. It's an amazing deal if your favorite team is in town
[2:14:49.320 --> 2:14:52.840]  It's it's questionable. They should they should have a different tier
[2:14:53.480 --> 2:14:57.080]  They should have like a tier for people who are fans of the in in game
[2:14:57.560 --> 2:14:59.400]  In town team or you pay less
[2:14:59.480 --> 2:15:04.360]  But you can only watch so many games a year because like and then when you go on vacation you can watch well
[2:15:04.360 --> 2:15:11.560]  What they did was the Yankees did a deal with I think one of the cable providers, so you could
[2:15:11.560 --> 2:15:17.400]  Sign up for MLB TV, but you had to pay through some maybe through the K
[2:15:17.400 --> 2:15:20.760]  I don't know. It was crazy. It was like and it was more expensive. I think
[2:15:22.360 --> 2:15:27.720]  This is one of those things where you're like these guys are not thinking about their customers at all and
[2:15:28.760 --> 2:15:30.760]  But it was some weird
[2:15:30.760 --> 2:15:35.880]  Thing I think with cable vision maybe where you could sign up. I don't know. Obviously. I didn't do it
[2:15:35.880 --> 2:15:41.000]  But you know, I'll tell you I don't want to say this because you're a friend and you're a frequent guest on the show
[2:15:41.800 --> 2:15:46.920]  But I mean it is that in in the last couple of months. I I've found more and more good stuff at
[2:15:47.400 --> 2:15:48.440]  Quartz
[2:15:48.440 --> 2:15:51.720]  Yeah, we're we're trying hard. We uh, we're expanding
[2:15:52.760 --> 2:15:57.080]  There's an opening on my team if you want to be a science writer in New York
[2:15:57.560 --> 2:16:03.720]  Um, and we're also working on getting someone in San Francisco to write tech for us. So but it's it's great
[2:16:03.720 --> 2:16:05.720]  I really like it. You know, I I uh
[2:16:06.600 --> 2:16:09.640]  Wasn't really looking for a day job, but I found a great one
[2:16:09.640 --> 2:16:14.520]  And I'm really happy there and there is really good stuff on the site. Yeah, I have a I have a piece
[2:16:14.520 --> 2:16:19.720]  I haven't posted yet. It's it will probably be the first post tomorrow queued up
[2:16:20.680 --> 2:16:22.680]  by Lily is a quote
[2:16:23.640 --> 2:16:26.680]  K you oh, I guess so um
[2:16:27.880 --> 2:16:28.760]  On

[2:16:58.600 --> 2:16:59.800]  um
