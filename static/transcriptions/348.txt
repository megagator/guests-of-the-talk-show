[00:00.000 --> 00:02.640]  I don't know. Should I say something about the Texas thing?
[00:02.640 --> 00:03.760]  That's not funny.
[00:03.760 --> 00:04.160]  I know.
[00:05.280 --> 00:07.760]  We were laughing, and then now it's not funny anymore.
[00:07.760 --> 00:08.320]  I know.
[00:08.320 --> 00:10.720]  Yeah, I mean, I guess so. We probably should. It's...
[00:11.920 --> 00:13.200]  I think I should say something quick.
[00:13.200 --> 00:14.560]  We're both parents, right?
[00:16.400 --> 00:22.480]  I mean, I assume that Jonas's school had drills and stuff like that as he was going through. I
[00:22.480 --> 00:26.480]  mean, our kids are almost out, so it's kind of a relief.
[00:26.480 --> 00:32.000]  Our school wasn't hardcore about the drills, but whenever these things come up, it's always
[00:32.000 --> 00:39.120]  a big deal, and lots of rules. I mean, so stupid. Lots of rules about the doors, blah, blah, blah.
[00:39.120 --> 00:41.920]  Yeah, right. Well, if you talk to certain Texas politicians,
[00:41.920 --> 00:43.200]  they'll tell you the doors of the problem.
[00:43.920 --> 00:47.760]  Yeah. Well, maybe this is the show. I don't usually comment on current events like this
[00:47.760 --> 00:51.760]  on the show, but this week with the school shooting, the massacre, I don't know what
[00:51.760 --> 00:57.600]  you want to call it. I don't want to sugarcoat it in Uvalde, Texas. I don't want to spend the
[00:57.600 --> 01:02.000]  show. I've been linking about it. I've been writing about it, so I feel like I shouldn't
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.800]  ignore it, and I want everybody to know I'm thinking about it. I mean, I think everybody
[01:06.800 --> 01:10.560]  is, but I also think it's good. I think it's good to have other things to think about,
[01:10.560 --> 01:15.040]  so this show is not going to dwell on it. I mean, it's not our show, and we'll have a good time,
[01:15.040 --> 01:19.360]  and we'll laugh, and we'll do our usual John and John goofing around thing, but it's in no way,
[01:19.360 --> 01:23.920]  at this point, leaving my mind, and probably everybody listening this, everybody's thinking
[01:23.920 --> 01:30.400]  about it in their back of their mind to some degree. Hard to pick it up after talking about it.
[01:30.400 --> 01:37.040]  No, no. We had talked about possibly talking about Obi-Wan, but it starts out with, well,
[01:37.040 --> 01:40.800]  if you haven't seen it, spoiler alert, it starts out with sort of a school shooting, right?
[01:40.800 --> 01:42.000]  Right. Yeah.
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.680]  Which is terrible, which is really unfortunate, obviously, and I don't even think,
[01:47.680 --> 01:52.560]  I guess it didn't even occur to Disney that it was somehow similar, and I didn't notice it.
[01:52.560 --> 01:56.400]  I didn't notice it when I watched the show, but a bunch of people were saying,
[01:56.400 --> 02:01.120]  boy, that was tough to see after, you know, what happened this week, and...
[02:02.320 --> 02:08.080]  Yeah, I watched it with Jonas last night, and again, we'll do no spoilers here,
[02:08.080 --> 02:13.440]  no serious spoilers for the first two episodes of Obi-Wan, but I'd...
[02:13.440 --> 02:17.120]  It's a flashback. It's a flashback to General Order 6, isn't it really?
[02:17.120 --> 02:21.120]  Yeah, but it, you know, the timing is, you know, and funny, somebody told me,
[02:21.120 --> 02:24.640]  I have not watched it yet, but somebody told me that Stranger Things season four,
[02:24.640 --> 02:30.160]  which dropped last week, also has some sort of thing with kids and getting hurt,
[02:30.160 --> 02:35.920]  and, you know, it's not an unreasonable thing to put in a work of fiction, but unfortunately...
[02:35.920 --> 02:38.640]  Yeah, that's the thing that I was thinking, like, it's not the,
[02:38.640 --> 02:42.800]  and the problem is not really the fiction. The problem is the reality.
[02:42.800 --> 02:47.200]  Right, and it's like, imagine if you put in to a work of fiction, and it happened to drop
[02:47.200 --> 02:53.680]  last weekend, a volcano erupting, you know, the odds of that actually happening in the real world
[02:53.680 --> 02:58.080]  around the same time are pretty low, doesn't, you know, it's pretty rare, thankfully. I guess
[02:58.080 --> 03:04.160]  something like, you know, a gun massacre of kids at a school is the likelihood, at least in one
[03:04.160 --> 03:09.760]  country, not naming names, in one country, you have a pretty high likelihood of running
[03:09.760 --> 03:13.280]  into current events. Well, have you heard about the flat Apple Watch?
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.840]  Is this the same, is it, so is the flat Apple Watch the same thing as the one
[03:17.840 --> 03:21.280]  that was supposedly going to have edges like the current iPhones?
[03:22.480 --> 03:24.640]  Yeah, that's the idea. Yeah, okay, right.
[03:26.880 --> 03:31.760]  Then yes, I've heard about it. But that was rumored, that was rumored earlier, right,
[03:31.760 --> 03:35.920]  and then it never came, and the Series 7 came out with just a larger screen.
[03:35.920 --> 03:44.080]  Yeah. Let's hold that thought. Let's work on this wonderful segue. Let me take a break here and get
[03:44.080 --> 03:48.160]  our first, have our first break on the show and say a good word about our good friends at

[04:56.160 --> 05:02.080]  My thanks to Squarespace. Yeah, that's a segue. See, you put a sponsor in there and now it feels
[05:02.080 --> 05:08.480]  a little bit more natural. Yeah, the rumor, I think John Prosser of front page tech on YouTube
[05:08.480 --> 05:15.360]  is largely responsible for the origin of this and has had CAD renders last year. And the rumor was
[05:15.360 --> 05:21.040]  that was the Apple Watch for last September. And then the really curious thing, because both of
[05:21.040 --> 05:25.280]  their records are so good in general and if they're not good, it's usually vagaries not
[05:25.280 --> 05:32.160]  being wrong, was that Mark Gurman and Ming-Chi Kuo in the run up early September or maybe end
[05:32.160 --> 05:39.200]  of August, but within 10 days of the actual unveiling of the Apple Watch Series 7, both
[05:39.200 --> 05:45.280]  said stuff about flat crystal and flat sides and none of it matched up because if anything,
[05:45.280 --> 05:51.200]  the crystal on the Series 7 watch is actually more curved and they even added, it's so curved
[05:51.200 --> 05:56.960]  and such a point of action that Apple even made a new watch faces just for the Series 7
[05:57.600 --> 06:02.480]  that show off how it curves around the side. You know what I mean? Like I forget what the name of
[06:02.480 --> 06:08.080]  the watch face is, but maybe I could look it up here on my watch. Geez. So that's back.
[06:08.960 --> 06:15.680]  Prosser ran a thing that said it's back. It might happen this year. It was one of those
[06:15.680 --> 06:19.920]  funny things last year, and I know that you enjoy this as much as me, is that when a rumor
[06:19.920 --> 06:28.320]  is wrong, a lot of times the story is not. Why would you think that I would enjoy rumors that
[06:28.320 --> 06:34.800]  are wrong? Well, what do some people, you tell me, what do some people do? It's not like I
[06:34.800 --> 06:39.840]  dedicated an entire site to that. When rumors are wrong, a lot of times the people who promoted the
[06:39.840 --> 06:45.360]  rumors or reported the rumors will have, you know, the unbelievable good luck of finding
[06:45.360 --> 06:52.320]  out that they weren't in fact wrong, but something changed. Yeah. Yeah. At the last minute,
[06:52.320 --> 06:58.880]  they changed the design of the Apple watch. They squeezed them all into a different shape.
[06:58.880 --> 07:05.680]  Right. And invented an entirely new crystal shape and watch faces and it came out. But anyway,
[07:05.680 --> 07:11.360]  the story is it might be coming out this year. And my theory all along, I got to write about it
[07:11.360 --> 07:15.520]  because if I don't, I've podcasted about it and, but haven't really written about it, but I have
[07:15.520 --> 07:21.120]  a theory and I still believe the theory. And in fact, I actually think my theory explained,
[07:21.120 --> 07:24.560]  actually does explain the whole thing. By the way, the watch face I was thinking of is called
[07:24.560 --> 07:29.040]  contour. That's the one where there's squished numerals around the outside of the Apple watch
[07:29.040 --> 07:36.960]  face on watchOSA. My theory is that the flat watch is real. It was in development last year,
[07:36.960 --> 07:44.240]  but it is the new Apple watch SE. It is not the expedition model that is supposedly that Gurman
[07:44.240 --> 07:50.000]  has, I think uniquely reported on that is supposedly like a, you know, like a G-Shock
[07:50.000 --> 07:55.360]  type thing, or I know Garmin makes a lot of those in the smartwatch space. I think it's the new
[07:55.360 --> 08:02.640]  Apple watch SE and that it might be the new low price thing. Like the Apple. So, okay. Well,
[08:02.640 --> 08:07.440]  can you explain that to me? Because usually when they introduce a new look, it goes to
[08:07.440 --> 08:12.320]  the new models, not the one that's, you know, the lower priced model, right? I mean,
[08:12.880 --> 08:16.800]  you look at the iPhone SE, obviously that is an iPhone 8.
[08:16.800 --> 08:26.080]  Right. So my theory works like this, that SE doesn't really mean take an old design and put
[08:26.080 --> 08:32.880]  new guts in it and sell it at a low price, even though that's how it plays out for the iPhone.
[08:32.880 --> 08:37.920]  Is there another SE? There's only iPhone SE and Apple watch SE, right? So we don't have a large,
[08:37.920 --> 08:44.800]  and that works for the Apple or for iPhone. It works to have old ones. But to me, what the SE
[08:44.800 --> 08:53.520]  really means is less looking old, but looking clearly less than. In other words, that it looks
[08:53.520 --> 09:00.960]  like this is the least expensive, whatever it is, you know, like if, if they came, if they came out
[09:00.960 --> 09:05.440]  with an iPad. But that's what I don't, that's what I still don't get though, because when they're
[09:05.440 --> 09:10.640]  introducing a new look, they go to great lengths to say how great this new look is. Look what we've
[09:10.640 --> 09:15.440]  done. Aren't we wonderful? And if they're doing that for the one that's cheaper, I don't see how
[09:15.440 --> 09:20.640]  that plays. Well, I think it's a stretch. Maybe I'm, you know, I could be all wet. I've, I have
[09:20.640 --> 09:25.760]  no inside juice on this. It's purely my own speculation. It's sort of fueled by my watch,
[09:25.760 --> 09:32.560]  nerdery hobby, you know, like traditional watches, but watches are different than phones, right?
[09:32.560 --> 09:38.320]  And so for the one, one thing is very specifically with Apple watch and iPhone is there are such
[09:38.320 --> 09:43.520]  things as older iPhones that look like older iPhones. Cause they, you know, the iPhone SE
[09:43.520 --> 09:48.320]  right now still has a home button and it still has square sides on the, on the display. And it
[09:48.320 --> 09:53.200]  still has totally square corners on the display with a chin and a forehead where the home button
[09:53.200 --> 09:59.840]  goes. So at just an instant glance, you can instantly see this is sort of the, you know,
[09:59.840 --> 10:05.360]  it's the SE iPhone that Apple watch can't really do that. Even right now where they're selling
[10:06.080 --> 10:10.640]  and, and the Apple watch lineup as it stands today is sort of messed up where the SE is not
[10:10.640 --> 10:16.000]  the lowest price model. The iPhone or Apple watch three series three is the lower price model. And
[10:16.000 --> 10:20.160]  the SE is actually more money. And now I don't know if that's what they plan to be selling that
[10:20.160 --> 10:25.600]  phone, but okay. I'd or the watch, the watch and that watch. Right. But you know, that maybe they
[10:25.600 --> 10:30.160]  just realized that in this transition and with the cost of goods and as they, you know, what,
[10:30.160 --> 10:36.800]  what's the baseline for like a good, you know, one 99 watch that's, that's based on like a new
[10:36.800 --> 10:42.000]  guts, like a new, all new SE, you know, that, that last year wasn't the year to do it. It would have,
[10:42.000 --> 10:48.800]  you know, or maybe, you know, they, maybe it was a by-product of the supply chain stuff with COVID
[10:48.800 --> 10:54.320]  and it was supposed to happen last year. And it's just, that's not going to happen. And you know,
[10:54.320 --> 11:00.800]  we can get these, this, this, and this out the door on time, but we'll punt on the, the new
[11:01.360 --> 11:05.760]  Apple watch SE and we'll just sell the app, the series three again for another year. You know,
[11:05.760 --> 11:09.600]  that that's, I don't know. I don't know what the backstory is. Apple never explained such things,
[11:09.600 --> 11:15.120]  but my thinking of why would a new look be for only for the SE is they don't have something,
[11:15.120 --> 11:19.760]  even with the series three, which we, everybody sort of acknowledges at a tech level and battery
[11:19.760 --> 11:24.720]  life level, and the screen doesn't stay on and blah, blah, blah is, is really not, it's kind of
[11:24.720 --> 11:30.960]  outdated at this point, but at a glance, it looks just like any other Apple watch. Like if you get
[11:30.960 --> 11:37.120]  close, you can see like when they, with series four, they change subtly changed the industrial
[11:37.120 --> 11:44.160]  design, the case dimensions and the shape of the round rectangle, whatever, you know,
[11:44.160 --> 11:49.920]  three dimensional shape, the watches, it is slightly bigger. You know, they went from 38 and
[11:49.920 --> 11:57.120]  42 to 40 and 44, slightly bigger, just different slight dimensions, but at a glance, you can't tell
[11:57.120 --> 12:02.400]  I can't. And I'm a nerd. I know Apple watches very well. I mean, but like when somebody walks by on
[12:02.400 --> 12:06.800]  the sidewalk or something like that, or I walked by somebody, if I were in an airport and I saw
[12:06.800 --> 12:10.240]  somebody or somebody's table at a restaurant and I just see, Oh, they have an Apple watch.
[12:10.240 --> 12:14.720]  I can't tell if it's a series three or a series four, you have to sort of stop and stare at it.
[12:15.680 --> 12:22.720]  I don't think that serves Apple's purposes for having a sort of good, better, best lineup of
[12:22.720 --> 12:27.680]  watches when it looks the same. And therefore I think a flat sided watch that's instantly
[12:27.680 --> 12:34.560]  recognizable as the Apple watch SE would serve that purpose, right? They can't use an old watch
[12:34.560 --> 12:37.840]  like, and they certainly, you know, if we admit that series three is too old at this point,
[12:37.840 --> 12:42.240]  then series four would be like the starting point for a new SE and the series four looks almost
[12:42.240 --> 12:46.480]  indistinguishable, however hard it is to tell series three and series four, five, six, seven
[12:46.480 --> 12:51.840]  apart, it's even harder to tell this series four from a series seven, right? It's like,
[12:51.840 --> 12:55.440]  how close do you have to get to see that the display curves under the sides a little bit?
[12:55.440 --> 13:00.800]  I mean, you got to, you know, if it's somebody else's watch, you're uncomfortably close to their
[13:00.800 --> 13:08.880]  wrist. So, you know, the only way they can make an Apple watch SE that clearly looks at a glance
[13:08.880 --> 13:14.960]  like, oh, that's the Apple watch SE is to give it an all new design. And to me, again, I'm basing
[13:14.960 --> 13:19.920]  this on CAD renders. And of course, you know, maybe in reality, Apple can make this thing that
[13:19.920 --> 13:25.600]  fits these CAD renders, proves that they were true. It has a flat top, has mostly flat sides,
[13:25.600 --> 13:30.880]  mostly looks, you know, the design language of the current iPhones with the flat sides and obviously
[13:30.880 --> 13:35.680]  flat display. Maybe it'll look great on the wrist and it will be the premium model. And then they
[13:35.680 --> 13:41.120]  can make the round one, the SE and go forward. But I don't think so. I think that the roundness
[13:41.120 --> 13:48.720]  of Apple watch is, and I know some people are bored. I heard, I was listening to Upgrade with
[13:48.720 --> 13:53.360]  our friends, Jason Snow and Mike Hurley. And Mike just said something offhanded about the fact that,
[13:53.360 --> 13:56.800]  hey, you know, every Apple watch today does look the same. I'm a little bored by it.
[13:57.440 --> 14:01.520]  That's sort of how watches work. And I know that most people are like,
[14:02.080 --> 14:06.480]  a lot of people who love their Apple watch have had no interest, never even wore a watch before,
[14:06.480 --> 14:12.800]  weren't wearing a watch for decades, don't care how the real world or the other world of watches
[14:12.800 --> 14:19.600]  works. But like, you know, like a Rolex Submariner from 1961, like that Sean Connery is wearing in
[14:19.600 --> 14:25.840]  the first James Bond movie. It looks exactly at a glance like a brand new Rolex Submariner that
[14:25.840 --> 14:30.720]  you could buy today, except long story. You can't actually buy Rolex Submariners. They're all out of
[14:30.720 --> 14:35.040]  stock around the world and have been for years, but you know, if you could get your hands on a
[14:35.040 --> 14:40.000]  brand new Rolex Submariner today, it's a watch nerd. I could tell you all the things that are
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.080]  suddenly different, but at a glance, people would say, oh, it's the exact same watch. Hasn't changed
[14:44.080 --> 14:52.480]  in 40 years, 50 years. That's sort of, I think the look of the, the capsule round shape of Apple
[14:52.480 --> 14:58.080]  watch. And I, so I, I sort of feel like there's room to have a shape that says this is like the
[14:58.080 --> 15:03.600]  $200 Apple watch. And these other ones are the $400 Apple watches. And then you can get them
[15:03.600 --> 15:09.200]  in titanium or stainless steel or with an Hermes band and pay more, but that those will all be
[15:09.200 --> 15:16.560]  round. That's, that's my theory. You think they like the round for the more expensive models?
[15:16.560 --> 15:21.520]  I do. And I think that they, I think they like that it's an iconic shape. It is something that
[15:21.520 --> 15:29.840]  they own and, you know, honestly it's, it's a lot less ripped off than the iPhone, right? It's like,
[15:29.840 --> 15:35.840]  it's, it's I, nobody really makes like a Android wear phone that, or, or watch that looks like an
[15:35.840 --> 15:41.280]  Apple watch. It is so distinctive. It is. Yeah. They're very, those other watches. I mean,
[15:41.280 --> 15:44.720]  those other smartwatch companies are just definitely invested in trying to,
[15:45.360 --> 15:49.440]  I mean, and I think it's probably a smart idea. I guess when Apple makes a square watch that you
[15:49.440 --> 15:57.280]  want to make a round watch, I suppose to make yours look different, but well, I'm not, I prefer,
[15:57.280 --> 16:03.040]  I prefer the square watch. Honestly, I prefer the, the, the screen of the square watch. I've looked
[16:03.040 --> 16:08.400]  at those other watches and, you know, I mean, the, the, the Pixel watch came out, you know,
[16:08.400 --> 16:13.200]  was at least revealed recently. And, you know, you look at notifications, you can see one
[16:13.200 --> 16:17.040]  notification at a time, really. Cause the other ones, when they scroll up and down, I mean,
[16:17.040 --> 16:22.320]  you can't see the whole notification and they may, you know, people will say, oh, yeah, you
[16:22.320 --> 16:24.960]  shouldn't be looking at your watch notifications all the time. Anyway. Well, that's kind of the
[16:24.960 --> 16:28.160]  point of the watch, right? You're trying to get information out. It doesn't have to be
[16:28.160 --> 16:33.840]  notifications. It could be something else. Right. And I just don't think it works as well. And the
[16:33.840 --> 16:38.000]  only reason that people like round watches is because that's the way most watches have been
[16:38.000 --> 16:43.040]  in the past, but it's not the way all watches have been in the past. Yeah, I agree. I really,
[16:43.040 --> 16:49.520]  cause scrolling content is inherently rectangular in nature. There's no way to do it. And so if you
[16:49.520 --> 16:55.200]  scroll content, whether it's like one long test, text message that you want to read on your watch,
[16:55.200 --> 17:00.000]  or, you know, a couple of alerts that have come in like, Hey, I've, I've felt a couple of taps
[17:00.000 --> 17:03.840]  there. Let me see, you know, let me go catch up on these alerts and you want to scroll through them.
[17:04.400 --> 17:09.840]  Scrolling content is inherently rectangular and the clipping that's inherent when you scroll on
[17:09.840 --> 17:14.880]  a circular display is annoying. I mean, it's like you said, you can really, you really only get the
[17:14.880 --> 17:19.440]  full width of the phone right at the equator and you get clipped at the bottom and the top. It's
[17:19.440 --> 17:24.800]  not great. And circular displays can work. I know I've mentioned this, I forget when, but it's like,
[17:24.800 --> 17:30.000]  we have the nest thermostats and those have a circular display and I love them. I think
[17:30.000 --> 17:34.320]  they're beautiful. I think they're, it's a really beautiful device. I really like having it in my
[17:34.320 --> 17:39.520]  house. It makes me happy to see it every time I go by, but a circular display works perfectly on a
[17:39.520 --> 17:44.880]  nest thermostat because except when it gets like an error condition, you'd never have to scroll.
[17:44.880 --> 17:48.880]  And even when, even when you get an error condition, we've had a thing over the winter
[17:48.880 --> 17:54.080]  where the, it was losing power to the, wherever it gets power through the wall. And I had to go down
[17:54.080 --> 18:00.720]  the cellar and flip a switch and it fixed it. Of course, I didn't call anybody to look at it. I just,
[18:01.360 --> 18:05.600]  as long as I can flip a switch once every couple of weeks in the winter and keep it going. But
[18:05.600 --> 18:09.520]  when it lost power, it would give me an error message. And even then it kind of
[18:09.520 --> 18:14.480]  optimized the here's what you should do and here's where you can go for more info for the circular
[18:14.480 --> 18:20.240]  display. You know, it's circular data looks great in a circular display. That's why most watches
[18:20.240 --> 18:26.320]  around because most, most regular watches just have hands that spin around the center. They,
[18:26.320 --> 18:31.520]  they're a circular, you know, same reason that speedometers on cars can look great as circles.
[18:31.520 --> 18:35.760]  Cause it's, it's just a dial that rotates around. But even then they come, you know,
[18:36.400 --> 18:45.200]  they cover up the day and date twice or, you know, I mean, like a few times throughout the
[18:45.200 --> 18:48.880]  day, it will cover up the day and date. The watch wearers paradox. It's like the,
[18:48.880 --> 18:53.120]  the butter toast always falling down is that the time of day that you want to check the date is
[18:53.120 --> 19:00.880]  always about three, three 15, three 15 is when I need, I need to know what is today's date. Oh,
[19:00.880 --> 19:05.600]  well I better wait till three 17. I'll come. I was, I was always a little surprised that
[19:05.600 --> 19:11.680]  Apple hadn't solved that problem with its faces that have hands. You know, like it seems like,
[19:11.680 --> 19:17.200]  you know, there's parallax on the phone and maybe the computing power of the watch isn't great
[19:17.200 --> 19:21.280]  enough to do parallax, but it seems like if you could just tilt, right, right. Is there something
[19:21.280 --> 19:25.040]  what you do, you know, you always try to do with a regular watch, but it would be,
[19:25.040 --> 19:28.560]  it would be something if maybe you can't tilt it enough. It just maybe didn't work,
[19:28.560 --> 19:35.040]  but it does seem like there should have been some way that they could accommodate the hands
[19:35.040 --> 19:39.600]  covering the day and date. And they did not or any other complications.
[19:39.600 --> 19:46.560]  I don't know. I, I would like to see, I would love that. That would be like an
[19:46.560 --> 19:52.000]  interesting design contest though, just to have a contest like design, design an Apple watch face
[19:52.000 --> 19:59.040]  where the day and date are, would fall under the three, you know, the minute hand and hour hand at
[19:59.040 --> 20:04.000]  three o'clock, but work around it when those hands would be covering it. What, what can you do?
[20:04.000 --> 20:07.200]  It seems like the minute with the minute hand, you could just have the complications on top
[20:07.200 --> 20:10.880]  anyway, but that would look weird. Maybe not with the, but not with the hour.
[20:10.880 --> 20:16.480]  Yeah, but they, they sort of, there is a Z access to the hands, right? It's the hour hand is below
[20:16.480 --> 20:20.640]  the minute hand, you know, is on top of the hour hand and the second hand is on top of that. So,
[20:21.760 --> 20:25.360]  I don't know. There's, there's gotta be a solution, but I'll be damned if I can,
[20:25.360 --> 20:29.520]  but anyway, I really do think it's possible. And I know that it sounds counterintuitive because in
[20:29.520 --> 20:34.560]  the iPhone world and all the other products, new industrial design always starts at the top and
[20:34.560 --> 20:41.120]  filters down. I just think that with Apple watch is different and it, it can work where, and again,
[20:41.120 --> 20:46.320]  I don't think that the curved, I think people underestimate how proud and how much work it was
[20:46.320 --> 20:53.360]  to get the series seven with the curved display to work and look around the sides from the sides,
[20:53.360 --> 21:01.520]  exactly the way Apple wants it to look like it, it would be a weird, a weird year to year zigzag
[21:01.520 --> 21:08.640]  for them to go from two years ago, series six, then series seven last year, the big new design
[21:08.640 --> 21:16.400]  thing is this round crystal screen on all the models, aluminum and steel and custom watch faces
[21:16.400 --> 21:24.400]  designed just to show off how the display is more curved. And then to 12 months later say, here's,
[21:24.400 --> 21:31.600]  here's the, here's the new Apple watch series eight perfectly flat. Like I think I, you know,
[21:31.600 --> 21:36.160]  and I know the phones are perfectly flat, but phones are different devices and flat works great
[21:36.160 --> 21:41.600]  for them. I kind of feel my hunch. And again, I'm only looking at CAD renders and I have a very poor
[21:41.600 --> 21:46.800]  visual imagination beyond what it's actually shown to me, but to me, that looks plain. It,
[21:46.800 --> 21:53.520]  it curved crystal looks fancier, more deluxe. It looks, you know, for lack of a better word,
[21:53.520 --> 21:58.400]  it looks more expensive. You know, I think lots of people would like the flat one. And I think lots
[21:58.400 --> 22:04.480]  of people like buying, you know, less than the, less than the new series eight starting price for
[22:04.480 --> 22:09.200]  their Apple watch. That's why Apple sells lower price models, you know, 350 bucks or whatever
[22:09.200 --> 22:13.840]  they start at or 400 bucks for the bigger one. It's a lot of money for a watch for most people.
[22:13.840 --> 22:18.320]  I mean, that's, that's a lot of money so I could see it, but I just feel like branding wise,
[22:18.320 --> 22:23.520]  it would serve Apple's purposes to have a distinction. Like the lower one, lower price one is
[22:23.520 --> 22:29.600]  flat and a little plainer. The more expensive ones have the iconic round Apple shape. Not that they
[22:29.600 --> 22:35.680]  got more expensive for the starting price of a new one, but to keep them. And, and then maybe this
[22:35.680 --> 22:39.680]  rugged thing is real too. I still, I know I've said it on the podcast before. I think there's
[22:39.680 --> 22:44.800]  absolutely positively a market for that rugged watch because whether it's a, I think, and I think
[22:44.800 --> 22:49.520]  it's two groups of people, it's a people who really need it because they do stuff like rock
[22:49.520 --> 22:54.960]  climbing or, or whatever other sports they might play that, that are, you know, truly, you know,
[22:54.960 --> 22:59.360]  like skateboarders and I don't know, all sorts of stuff that I'm way too old for. Things that you
[22:59.360 --> 23:03.280]  might want to wear a watch for where you really are banging the watch into hard services and you
[23:03.280 --> 23:09.040]  don't want it to break. And B people who just, you know, same sort of people who put their iPhone
[23:09.040 --> 23:13.680]  in an OtterBox case, you know, that's almost like a lock box, even though they don't do anything,
[23:13.680 --> 23:18.800]  particularly risky with their phones. They just are very, you know, Hey, I spent a lot of money
[23:18.800 --> 23:24.720]  on this. I don't want to get cracked or broken or dinged. And they would, you know, I, and I just
[23:24.720 --> 23:28.880]  don't think, I know some people, I know there are third-party things that you can put your current
[23:28.880 --> 23:35.600]  Apple watches in, in like an enclosure, you know, to protect them. I, they, those, that's awkward,
[23:35.600 --> 23:40.000]  right? I mean, cause putting it, you know, the watch is so small. I mean, I, but the fact that
[23:40.000 --> 23:45.680]  they exist tells you there's a market for them. Yeah. Yeah. I'm looking at, I'm looking at these
[23:45.680 --> 23:51.040]  renders and a, of course it's, I think part of the problem is, is that it's just a render
[23:51.600 --> 23:57.520]  and it does look plain. Yep. It looks, it looks like a knockoff, right? It looks like,
[23:57.520 --> 24:03.360]  it looks like something that you'd order off Alibaba and it would work for, you know, a few
[24:03.360 --> 24:08.960]  weeks, but I don't know. I mean, I think they could make it nice. I think they could still do
[24:08.960 --> 24:12.080]  the thing, you know, like what we've done, we've completely changed the, the Apple watch.
[24:12.080 --> 24:17.280]  Oh, I, I, I think they'll, but yeah, they'll brag about it, right. In the same way that,
[24:17.280 --> 24:21.920]  that like, before they tell you about the new iPhone pro models, they, they spend a huge amount
[24:21.920 --> 24:26.480]  of time on the regular non-pro new iPhones and tell you how great they are and how great the
[24:26.480 --> 24:32.000]  camera is. And, you know, you know, no expense spared, you know, to promote them. Right. Remember
[24:32.000 --> 24:35.440]  when Kayan Drance, I forget if it was last year or the year before, and they had that whole
[24:35.440 --> 24:40.320]  amphitheater in Southern California, just, just for Kayan Drance to be on stage in front of an
[24:40.320 --> 24:44.400]  empty audience to tell us about it. It was impressive. And that's just for the non-pro
[24:44.400 --> 24:49.200]  ones. Right. I mean, it's, you know, they'll definitely promote it. I, but I also think that
[24:49.200 --> 24:53.840]  having the flat side one means that they could run separate ads for it. Right. That they could,
[24:53.840 --> 24:58.720]  you know, they can run separate ads for the new Apple watch SEs starting at, I don't know,
[24:58.720 --> 25:02.880]  maybe it'll start at 250 or something like that. I don't know. But then they can say starting at
[25:02.880 --> 25:08.320]  just 250 or, or of course in their parlance, it would be 249 or, you know, maybe if we're
[25:08.320 --> 25:11.440]  super lucky, maybe it would be, it would be awesome. I'd love it. If it was started at
[25:11.440 --> 25:16.800]  199, like the series three does today, but then they could run a totally separate ad for that
[25:17.520 --> 25:24.880]  and have a different ad for the new higher end models, you know? Right. Well, that's,
[25:24.880 --> 25:30.160]  that's my theory on the, on that. Let me take another break here. Oh boy. This one is going
[25:30.160 --> 25:35.600]  to be fun. This is a sponsorship from our good friend, Alex Weinstein. You guys know Alex
[25:35.600 --> 25:40.720]  Weinstein. He's the guy who wrote the much celebrated theme song to this show. Picking
[25:40.720 --> 25:47.280]  boogers with John, which did not, did not last long, but is an all time classic that everybody
[25:47.280 --> 25:53.120]  loves. And it, look, it, what does Alex Weinstein provide for you? Music. It's custom music. The
[25:53.120 --> 25:58.880]  right music can make a joke funny. It can bring an audience to tears. Music makes commercials
[25:58.880 --> 26:04.320]  unforgettable. It makes games addictive. It keeps customers interested when they might click away.
[26:04.320 --> 26:08.880]  Let's say you're making a commercial, a film, a game, an event, or maybe a podcast. You can go
[26:08.880 --> 26:13.680]  to that same old stock music site and sort through the same thousands of tracks that everybody else
[26:13.680 --> 26:17.920]  is sorting through and get something generic and you find something decent, but it sounds like
[26:17.920 --> 26:22.560]  everything else because everyone else is picking from the same stock music and the length is wrong.
[26:22.560 --> 26:26.640]  It doesn't quite fit the thing you're working on and the drums are weird. It's time for something
[26:26.640 --> 26:31.920]  new. Alex Weinstein music. This is a direct line to one of the most prominent media composers in
[26:31.920 --> 26:37.520]  tech. And here's why Alex's music is different. It's handmade and organic. You are listening to
[26:37.520 --> 26:41.840]  it right now. As I read this, I'm not listening to it because we're going to, we're going to do this
[26:41.840 --> 26:47.760]  magic and post, but you are, you're listening to some of his music right now, as I tell you about
[26:47.760 --> 26:53.520]  his music and you can tell the result is a unique style that helps your project stand out. Don't
[26:53.520 --> 26:58.880]  just take my word for it because he wrote my pick and boogers theme song. Alex's music has been used
[26:58.880 --> 27:05.920]  by serious companies like Google, Microsoft, Intel, Disney, Slack, Panic. If you really want to talk
[27:05.920 --> 27:11.120]  about companies with great taste and tons of others, there are a few ways to work with Alex.
[27:11.120 --> 27:14.960]  If you need something right away, you can try the license library. It's a collection of songs that
[27:14.960 --> 27:19.760]  are ready to go and every track can be customized. So it fits just right. And if you want something
[27:19.760 --> 27:25.200]  original collaborate with Alex together, you can explore different styles and create something
[27:25.200 --> 27:30.320]  totally new. Alex's original score for the film 88 miles per hour was just released. This is a
[27:30.320 --> 27:35.680]  feature length documentary about the back to the future DeLorean. Yes, that DeLorean and the
[27:35.680 --> 27:40.720]  soundtrack is a retro futuristic journey that takes you to other worlds. It's available on
[27:40.720 --> 27:45.360]  Apple music and Spotify. Just go, go search for it. You can listen to it. That's a lot of fun.
[27:45.360 --> 27:49.920]  And as you might've guessed, those songs from that album are available for you to license in your
[27:49.920 --> 27:59.840]  projects today. So go to alexweinstein.com, a-l-e-x-w-e-i-n-s-t-e-i-n, alexweinstein.com
[28:00.480 --> 28:05.040]  slash the talk show alexweinstein.com slash the talk show.
[28:05.040 --> 28:16.000]  I don't know if I should have sung that or what, but I guess if I sing it, you know,
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.480]  then he's got to write the music to my singing. Well, you'd have to have the music. You'd have
[28:18.480 --> 28:22.640]  to be able to hear the music and sing along with the music. Also on the rumors front,
[28:22.640 --> 28:26.400]  I want to hit this because this is the thing I've had these special episodes where I've been
[28:26.400 --> 28:30.800]  interviewing people about their creative stuff on the show, Zach Gage. And I had Tripp Mickle on
[28:30.800 --> 28:34.480]  the last episode, but now I'm behind on all the rumors and all the Apple stuff,
[28:34.480 --> 28:38.880]  which is kind of fun. But we got to talk about this, that the rumors are ramping up that Apple's
[28:38.880 --> 28:46.720]  testing USB-C for the iPhone for next year. Not this year. Slow your roll, people. And
[28:47.520 --> 28:52.800]  again, Gurman and Ming-Chi Kuo, I think, both said this around the same time. I think Ming-Chi
[28:52.800 --> 28:57.520]  Kuo was first on Twitter, but then Gurman said the same thing. And I think the way Gurman phrased it
[28:57.520 --> 29:02.160]  is that Apple is testing it, which is a weird way to put it, sort of a hedge, in my opinion.
[29:02.160 --> 29:07.040]  Like, I kind of think at this—and again, this is for next year, not three months from now or
[29:07.040 --> 29:12.000]  four months from now, but, you know, 2023. I sort of think if Apple's going USB-C, they know it
[29:12.000 --> 29:15.280]  already. They don't really need to test it. I mean, what are they testing? If they know how
[29:15.280 --> 29:19.120]  to put it? What's the point? Yeah, exactly. What is the point? I mean, you know, you've seen people
[29:19.120 --> 29:24.880]  who have actually ripped apart an iPhone and put a USB-C. It can be done by people on the street,
[29:24.880 --> 29:28.640]  obviously not me, but people who have those skills. So Apple can certainly do it.
[29:28.640 --> 29:34.480]  And I have to say, that's the sort of thing I, as an old person who doesn't want to take apart
[29:34.480 --> 29:40.800]  phones anymore, I have to say that is impressive. Like, because, you know, like in the old days of
[29:40.800 --> 29:45.360]  computers, when it was all just electrical, if it was hooked up, then the electrons were flowing,
[29:45.360 --> 29:48.960]  and that's it. It was, you know, and it was fun to hack stuff together. But now with all
[29:48.960 --> 29:55.680]  the security stuff and, you know, parts verification and stuff, it's all the more
[29:55.680 --> 30:02.480]  impressive, no matter how janky the connector is. I think I replaced, the last thing I did
[30:02.480 --> 30:09.200]  on anything small was replace a battery on an iPod, you know, like the video, I think it was
[30:09.200 --> 30:13.280]  the video iPod, the color video iPod. And you did that by hand? And yeah, I did that by hand.
[30:13.280 --> 30:17.680]  And then I was just, I thought like, okay, that was, that was too hard for my eyes,
[30:17.680 --> 30:21.920]  too hard for my hand. I mean, that was too small for me. I mean, I still, I'll still replace,
[30:21.920 --> 30:26.560]  you know, on the machines that I can't, like I have a Mac mini, I'll replace the hard drive
[30:26.560 --> 30:30.800]  and the RAM and stuff like that on that. But I'm not, I'm not dealing with an iPhone personally.
[30:30.800 --> 30:33.600]  Well, I can't lift the kit. I can't lift the kit. It's like 80 pounds.
[30:33.600 --> 30:37.280]  Well, we'll get to that. We'll get to the self-repair program. But for now,
[30:37.840 --> 30:41.440]  I don't think the self-repair, although it would be funny if the self-repair program,
[30:41.440 --> 30:47.440]  if they added, this is where you know that Apple is losing their mind, is if they added
[30:47.440 --> 30:52.240]  an option to the self-repair program to do an ad hoc USB-C upgrade to your own iPhone.
[30:54.160 --> 30:56.000]  Do you want a new screen, a new battery?
[30:56.000 --> 30:59.760]  Yeah. Can you imagine like where people have places like iFix and they-
[30:59.760 --> 31:04.960]  I do think that this is a little weird. And I know that there's lots of people who've been,
[31:04.960 --> 31:09.680]  I know this, whenever this iPhone should have USB-C thing comes up, that there are,
[31:09.680 --> 31:14.640]  it's one of those issues where people, some people are on one side, some people are on the
[31:14.640 --> 31:19.520]  other side. Like, no, no, keep lightning. I don't want to have new cables all over the place. And,
[31:19.520 --> 31:25.840]  you know, I'm in the middle, which is weird because the people who really want the iPhone
[31:25.840 --> 31:33.280]  to have USB-C are adamant about it. Like, and they can't fathom either my perspective being
[31:33.280 --> 31:42.000]  ambivalent or the idea that there are tens, maybe hundreds of millions of people out there who would
[31:42.000 --> 31:46.480]  rather just keep the chargers they already have and would be annoyed by a new charger.
[31:47.120 --> 31:53.840]  It's a long time. What was it? The iPhone 5 that went to you, lightning, I believe.
[31:54.960 --> 31:58.640]  That sounds about right. Yeah. Cause I know I have a, yeah, I have a, yeah,
[31:58.640 --> 32:03.360]  I have a 4 and it definitely has the dock connector. I mean, I assume the 4S did too.
[32:03.360 --> 32:08.640]  Right. So the dock connector to lightning was an amazing upgrade, right? Because the
[32:08.640 --> 32:16.560]  dock connector was big and wide and ugly. It's an ugly port. It's so big, right? You could like
[32:16.560 --> 32:21.120]  fit like a whole quarter in there that the connector itself had sharp little prongs that
[32:21.120 --> 32:27.120]  snapped in it. It was, you know, it doesn't like it would cut you, but it's, it was not a pleasant
[32:27.120 --> 32:33.200]  connector. It going from that to lightning was clearly an upgrade. It charged faster. It had the
[32:33.200 --> 32:37.600]  capability of charging faster. I think it has faster data than the old 30 pin thing ever did.
[32:37.600 --> 32:43.040]  It just seemed like a win and millions and millions of iPhone users were upset and thought
[32:43.040 --> 32:48.880]  it was a money grab from Apple to sell more cables. Right. People were, people don't like
[32:48.880 --> 32:53.200]  it when the chargers change. They, and I don't know, I don't know how many times I have to say
[32:53.200 --> 32:58.640]  it, but a lot of people really don't like it. And, and I know like my sister and her husband,
[32:58.640 --> 33:04.000]  I think a lot of couples do this. They, they, they get new iPhones every two years, but they,
[33:04.000 --> 33:09.120]  they're on the opposite cycle of each other, you know? So like, I don't know, one year my wife gets
[33:09.120 --> 33:13.680]  a new phone and the next year her husband gets a new iPhone. And then the next year it's my wife's
[33:13.680 --> 33:18.000]  turn and that sort of thing. And they were annoyed because now I don't know whose year it was for the
[33:18.000 --> 33:21.760]  new iPhone when the iPhone five came out, but now they, you know, one charger in the kitchen
[33:21.760 --> 33:26.960]  couldn't work for both of them. And, you know, she wasn't angry, you know, but, you know, she was
[33:26.960 --> 33:30.720]  like, why did they do that? And I'm like, well, look at it, look how much smaller it is. It's
[33:30.720 --> 33:36.240]  nicer people. And I know people are like, well, I have USB-C all over the place where there's a
[33:36.240 --> 33:41.120]  lot of people whose only device is the iPhone. And the other weird thing is Apple's been putting
[33:41.120 --> 33:45.760]  lightning chargers in everything else, right? The mice, the keep, you know, everybody loves the,
[33:45.760 --> 33:50.720]  the, the mouse with the lightning port on the belly. The Apple, the Apple, the Apple TV remote
[33:50.720 --> 33:55.920]  control charges by lightning. The big one I can think of is AirPods. Every single AirPods case
[33:55.920 --> 34:03.120]  sold the date charges by lightning. So backing out of this and saying, you know, going, okay, okay,
[34:03.120 --> 34:08.640]  let's just, let's, let's slowly move everything to USB-C. It could do it, right. You know, and
[34:08.640 --> 34:13.840]  I guess then subsequent, you know, the next versions of AirPods will come out with a USB-C
[34:13.840 --> 34:18.800]  on the case instead of lightning. And those of us with lightning ones will just, you know, have
[34:18.800 --> 34:24.320]  a several year transition away from whether we still need a lightning cable around or not. But
[34:24.320 --> 34:29.280]  it, the thing that's weird to me is if they were going to do it, it seemed to me like the time to
[34:29.280 --> 34:34.320]  do it was like two or three years ago. That's, that's my bottom line. Well, I would say that
[34:34.320 --> 34:38.560]  was a better time to do it. I mean, I still think, I still think it's a decent time to do it now. I,
[34:38.560 --> 34:46.480]  I, I am more in favor of this change simply because I, every time I try and, well, I shouldn't
[34:46.480 --> 34:50.720]  say that, but I mean, I get a lot of frustration trying to charge via lightning and that's why I
[34:50.720 --> 34:55.200]  hardly ever do it because mostly with my phone, I mostly use MagSafe all the time because mostly
[34:55.200 --> 35:01.680]  because my, my lightning port is full of lint. And because, and because I don't, I don't feel
[35:01.680 --> 35:09.520]  like the connector is, and maybe this is not, maybe this is just my imagination, but I feel
[35:09.520 --> 35:15.120]  like the connector isn't as long lasting as USB-C has proven to be for me. Cause every time I, every
[35:15.120 --> 35:23.120]  time I plug my, my iPad in, it charges without hesitation. And when I charge, when I, anytime
[35:23.120 --> 35:29.120]  I plug something that is lightning in, I'm never 100% sure. And it's usually somebody's, it's
[35:29.120 --> 35:32.720]  almost always somebody's phone because everything else I would charge, like even my AirPods, I charge
[35:32.720 --> 35:39.360]  by MagSafe as well, or not MagSafe, you know, it's actually cheap, but whatever. So I get this
[35:39.360 --> 35:45.680]  impression that it's slightly more reliable. So I, I would rather have the thing that's more reliable.
[35:45.680 --> 35:50.560]  I, you know, and again, I, there, I see pros and cons on both sides. You know, the, the biggest pro
[35:50.560 --> 35:54.800]  for lightning clearly is that there are lightning cables all over the place. People's cars,
[35:54.800 --> 35:59.200]  their kitchens, their bedsides, wherever they want to have them, they have them. And we have these
[35:59.200 --> 36:05.600]  other devices from Apple that charge by lightning and it's there. The downsides are pretty obvious
[36:05.600 --> 36:10.320]  too. Well, number one is, well, there's two, two, I don't even know which order to put them in.
[36:10.320 --> 36:16.720]  One is that everything else like computers and now iPads, you know, growing more and more,
[36:16.720 --> 36:22.160]  including like the iPad mini and the new iPad Air, they charge by USB-C too. And so the packing
[36:22.160 --> 36:27.840]  situation, you know, or, or, you know, just having a spare charger somewhere and you could use the
[36:27.840 --> 36:31.680]  same charger, you could charge your MacBook, you could charge your iPad, you could charge your
[36:31.680 --> 36:35.760]  computer, you could charge your phone. If, if they come out with new AirPods, whatever, if everything
[36:35.760 --> 36:40.080]  charged by USB-C, then, you know, there's an advantage where if you have anything that kind
[36:40.080 --> 36:44.480]  of looks like, I don't know from a distance, is that lightning or USB-C, if they're all USB-C and
[36:44.480 --> 36:49.600]  all your devices are charged by that, that adapter, that's a win. I get it. And the other big one,
[36:50.160 --> 36:55.600]  and this is where I feel, I know Renee, you know, Richie actually uses it. So he's,
[36:55.600 --> 37:01.840]  he's more frustrated, but these phones record 4K video, which is really, really big and lightning
[37:01.840 --> 37:10.240]  USB top speed is really slow compared to what, what USB-C can transfer. And, you know, who knows,
[37:10.240 --> 37:15.120]  maybe they'll go Thunderbolt, you know, maybe it looks like a USB-C port and the iPhone 14 pro or
[37:15.120 --> 37:19.360]  15 pros, whatever it would be next year will actually have Thunderbolt speed, who knows,
[37:19.360 --> 37:25.760]  but whatever it would be even USB-C, USB three over a USB-C cable is faster. And I mean,
[37:25.760 --> 37:30.880]  so much faster that it, you know, makes it practical to shoot 4K video on a phone and
[37:30.880 --> 37:35.600]  get it off onto your Mac or whatever for editing it, you know, that something's got to give on that
[37:35.600 --> 37:40.640]  front. That's the one place where lightning is really sort of at, at wits end or, or tech it's
[37:40.640 --> 37:47.840]  the end of its technical life. I just, so I get it. I, I wonder, see, I, I feel like the natural
[37:47.840 --> 37:52.720]  time to make that transition would have been when they first added the word pro to iPhones,
[37:52.720 --> 37:58.400]  which was, I think the iPhone 11 pro, right? There was the iPhone 11, which was sort of like
[37:59.200 --> 38:06.080]  an XR, right? A 10 R and the iPhone 11 pro, and now they have pro phones that, that might've been
[38:06.080 --> 38:11.360]  the time to do it. Cause that's sort of how they ease the iPad over. Right. And you know, the iPad
[38:11.360 --> 38:18.560]  shows how, how Apple can transition a thing that was previously all lightning to USB-C. It's like
[38:18.560 --> 38:26.000]  a years long thing as it trickles down, but starts at the pro end. And then it gives them a story to
[38:26.000 --> 38:31.920]  tell, which is look, pros are shooting these big video files. There's rumors even that the subs,
[38:31.920 --> 38:36.320]  you know, maybe this year, maybe next year, iPhones will be capable of shooting 8K video,
[38:36.320 --> 38:40.720]  which is, you know, like four times the size of 4K or something. I don't know how big it is,
[38:40.720 --> 38:46.000]  but it's, you know, sounds big, you know, pros need the data speed pros need higher speed charging.
[38:46.000 --> 38:52.880]  So we've added pro strength, the USB-C to the iPhone, whatever number pro that that's a story
[38:52.880 --> 38:59.360]  to tell. And all the headlines all over the web can put all the final ease in that they want,
[38:59.360 --> 39:03.440]  but it's done and there's a story and it makes sense. And then like the next year,
[39:03.440 --> 39:08.880]  maybe USB-C trickles to, to the, to the mid range iPhones, you know, the regular non-pro ones,
[39:08.880 --> 39:14.160]  something like that. I just feel like that the iPhone 11 pro was the year to do it. If they knew
[39:14.160 --> 39:19.920]  they were going to do it anyway, like why string this along for so much longer, right? I mean,
[39:19.920 --> 39:24.800]  at this point, if it's two, if it's a year and a half from now, when iPhones first come out with
[39:24.800 --> 39:32.480]  USB-C, USB-C will be eight years old at that point. Like, yeah. Maybe that's just the maturing
[39:32.480 --> 39:39.360]  of the industry and that, you know, maybe I'm a little too biased towards the older days when
[39:39.360 --> 39:44.960]  every couple of years there were new adapters for everything and just, you know, and improvements,
[39:44.960 --> 39:49.440]  right. That speed, you know, this is so much faster than that, and this is so much faster
[39:49.440 --> 39:54.160]  than that. And you just expect something to only have a lifespan of 10 years before it's completely
[39:54.160 --> 40:01.520]  technically obviated. And, you know, maybe USB-C is a port technology that really is going to have
[40:01.520 --> 40:07.200]  decades, plural, of life, and moving to it eight years in is not too late.
[40:08.800 --> 40:15.040]  I don't know. I just also can't help, though, but wonder if Apple had some sort of other plan for
[40:15.040 --> 40:20.400]  a port and it just hasn't worked out, you know, some kind of like a MagSafe type thing that does
[40:21.200 --> 40:28.160]  high-speed charging data as well, and high-speed data, right? Yeah. And the one thing that really
[40:28.160 --> 40:33.920]  made me think like, hmm, that would be really interesting for a next-generation iPhone port
[40:34.640 --> 40:42.800]  was the 24-inch iMac that does Ethernet over the power cable, right? Like, you have one cable that
[40:42.800 --> 40:50.320]  goes from the wall charger to your iMac 24-inch, and if you want to connect an Ethernet cable,
[40:50.320 --> 40:55.440]  you connect it to the thing that goes into the wall, right? That's a really interesting design
[40:55.440 --> 41:00.400]  because now you've got this power cable that is doing, I don't know if it's 100-bit Ethernet or
[41:00.400 --> 41:06.080]  what, but, you know, data and charging over a connector. And I guess the 24-inch iMac doesn't
[41:06.080 --> 41:11.040]  have MagSafe, you know, it's not like that cord comes out of the back easily, but, you know,
[41:11.040 --> 41:14.640]  you could see how that sort of thinking would do it. But I just wonder if they've hit like
[41:14.640 --> 41:18.160]  a brick wall on that, if they had like something that they were thinking and they're like,
[41:18.160 --> 41:25.200]  we better just, rather than switch to USB-C for just a few years before we unveil this new thing,
[41:25.200 --> 41:30.320]  this new technology, we'll just stick with Lightning so that there's only one transition,
[41:30.320 --> 41:34.560]  right? Because that's the thing. That's the thing I want to emphasize. If they do switch the iPhone
[41:34.560 --> 41:39.360]  to USB-C next year, they have to stick with it. They have to have USB-C until there's no charger
[41:39.360 --> 41:44.720]  at all. Right. And that is the other rumor, right? I mean, the other rumor is that there
[41:44.720 --> 41:51.280]  is a portless iPhone coming. And it does not seem to make much sense for them to do
[41:51.280 --> 41:57.520]  two years or however long it would be and then go portless. Right. And the thing about going
[41:57.520 --> 42:01.840]  portless, of course, it makes sense in the abstract, you know, that Apple would prefer
[42:01.840 --> 42:08.480]  no ports. Ports are ugly. Of course, you know, no ports in the abstract is clearly more aesthetically
[42:08.480 --> 42:16.320]  pleasing and simpler than one port. But the problem is that neither the charging speed
[42:16.320 --> 42:22.160]  of current inductive charging with MagSafe, or at least on phones, right? Like you can charge your,
[42:22.160 --> 42:27.120]  I mean, Apple can do it, right? Because MacBooks charge really fast, you know, 87 watts on a 16
[42:27.120 --> 42:32.560]  inch MacBook Pro or more, maybe, maybe it's 90 some, I don't know, but, you know, close to 100
[42:32.560 --> 42:39.040]  watts of charging over a thing that you can just, you know, boop boop, magnet, magnet in, magnet off.
[42:39.040 --> 42:44.800]  So, but the current MagSafe that just goes on the back is so much slower than, you know,
[42:44.800 --> 42:50.720]  much slower than plugging in a lightning cable with a, you know, 30 watt charger in the wall.
[42:50.720 --> 42:56.080]  And data, right? That what's the data, if part of the problem with lightning today is that data
[42:56.080 --> 43:03.520]  transfer is too slow when you've shot these giant gigabyte video files, you know, how does
[43:03.520 --> 43:09.360]  going to wireless technology help that? It does not. Right. Unless they have something new, right?
[43:09.360 --> 43:14.960]  In theory, they could have something, you know, USB-C should not be, and this is what I wrote
[43:14.960 --> 43:19.680]  back when the EU was mandating that all phones are all devices, whatever the rules are, that,
[43:19.680 --> 43:24.000]  you know, anything that has a charging needs to be a standard charger. You know, once that law goes,
[43:24.000 --> 43:30.400]  if it were to go on the books, it's hard to change laws, right? You get a law like that,
[43:30.400 --> 43:34.400]  and it's like, oh, well, then the whole industry will come together and invent something new.
[43:34.400 --> 43:38.000]  That's not really how new things happen. New things are much more likely to happen from
[43:38.000 --> 43:42.320]  one company with a great idea that doesn't need to get permission and go through a consortium
[43:42.320 --> 43:46.560]  and reveal their plans to everybody and get everybody to agree to it, you know, much more
[43:46.560 --> 43:51.760]  likely. You know, it's something like the way lightning came out of thin air from Apple without
[43:51.760 --> 43:56.560]  any, you know, need for cooperation from the industry. And then lo and behold, that inspired
[43:56.560 --> 44:02.480]  the USB consortium to make something much more lightning-like than previous USB connectors.
[44:02.480 --> 44:08.880]  So I don't know. I don't know what to think about it. I also think it's a little weird, too,
[44:08.880 --> 44:13.840]  that it's a next year thing. I mean, and I know, you know, I famously love to reiterate that,
[44:13.840 --> 44:18.480]  you know, the iPhones are pretty much set about a year in advance. It's just there's no other way to
[44:18.480 --> 44:23.840]  make 100 million iPhones a year than to sort of lock in the design at least a year in advance.
[44:24.400 --> 44:28.640]  Probably most decisions are made more than a year in advance. And whenever I write about it,
[44:28.640 --> 44:34.000]  if little birdies give me tips, they often even suggest that even I'm too optimistic
[44:34.640 --> 44:39.760]  about how late in the game they can make changes, you know, and how, you know, you know, and it,
[44:42.640 --> 44:48.560]  but it's, you know, so I'm not saying that it at this point, you know, like in April 2022,
[44:48.560 --> 44:53.280]  last month, that Apple could say, hey, maybe next year we'll switch to USB-C, you know,
[44:53.280 --> 44:59.600]  this is whatever the discussion is inside Apple. It is, it has been ongoing for a very long time,
[44:59.600 --> 45:04.320]  but it does seem slightly, I don't know, just seems like a weird time. I don't know.
[45:05.840 --> 45:07.360]  I don't know. I don't know what else to say about it.
[45:09.040 --> 45:14.320]  Uh, yeah, I was, I was, I started, I think I started out thinking, oh yeah, sure. Why not?
[45:14.320 --> 45:19.200]  Now I am, you know, I'm actually, does this make sense at all? What's the,
[45:19.200 --> 45:22.480]  and I guess Gurman said they're going to ship a little dongle, you know, of course,
[45:22.480 --> 45:27.120]  I guess, but imagine like that's, that's. Well, they already ship a dongle in like
[45:27.120 --> 45:29.840]  certain markets, right? They should be going the other way, obviously.
[45:29.840 --> 45:32.080]  Yeah. But man, talk about something is it'd be easy to lose.
[45:32.080 --> 45:35.680]  I don't know why. Yeah. Why? Oh man. Yeah. It's I don't know.
[45:38.080 --> 45:42.080]  When was the last time they shipped a dongle that, you know, that, I mean, they made the
[45:42.080 --> 45:46.160]  headphone, the headphone, they shipped the headphone dongle, right? Yeah. Yeah.
[45:46.160 --> 45:53.440]  Yeah. Maybe that's what the, the lightning to USB-C thing would be like. Maybe instead of like
[45:53.440 --> 45:58.400]  a little, just a little like pen cap, you know, like the, the cap for an Apple pencil
[45:59.280 --> 46:05.280]  lightning port, you know, the original, you know how the original pencil had a lightning port and
[46:05.280 --> 46:09.280]  had a little cap you could lose, you know, maybe instead of a little thing like that,
[46:09.280 --> 46:14.320]  that you snap on the end of the lightning cable, turn it to a USB-C, maybe it would be a little
[46:14.320 --> 46:18.800]  cable, like a little two inch cable, which I feel like for the headphone thing, it's not that
[46:18.800 --> 46:23.760]  I don't feel like making it a cable made it more useful. I think it just made it less likely to
[46:23.760 --> 46:26.320]  lose. You know what I mean? Yeah.
[46:26.320 --> 46:30.400]  I've always thought that that might be the reason why it's not just a little snap on thing that
[46:30.400 --> 46:34.640]  it's, it's sort of a little cable. Cause it's, it's less likely that you'd lose it.
[46:36.960 --> 46:39.760]  I did. I have a table. Sure. Complained about losing people. Sure. Complained
[46:39.760 --> 46:42.880]  about losing them though. Did I, did I ever tell you about the time I lost?
[46:42.880 --> 46:47.360]  I'm not sure that stopped anybody. I lost the cap to my first Apple pencil
[46:47.360 --> 46:54.080]  on an Amtrak train and it, it fell behind like into the butt, you know, the, the, the crack at
[46:54.080 --> 46:58.960]  your butt on the seat. And I thought, ah, and it was like, I don't know what happened.
[46:58.960 --> 47:04.160]  It was the crack in the seats, but yeah, the seats, but I was like, ah man. And it was like
[47:04.160 --> 47:07.680]  at the time when it's like, we're pulling up towards the station and everybody who's getting
[47:07.680 --> 47:11.200]  off. I don't know if I was getting off. It was either, I always get off at either New York or
[47:11.200 --> 47:15.280]  I'm back home in Philly. Either I was getting to New York or I was, I was getting home to Philly
[47:15.280 --> 47:20.960]  and it was still daytime. So I could see, and I like got in there and like turned on my iPhone
[47:20.960 --> 47:26.400]  flashlight and was looking back there and I saw it and it looked like maybe I could reach it,
[47:27.040 --> 47:32.560]  but there's, there's a lot of stuff back there, you know, like, I don't think you want to reach
[47:32.560 --> 47:37.920]  in there. I think there's like pieces of gum that Joe Biden chewed in like 1979, you know,
[47:37.920 --> 47:44.240]  while riding the same train to Congress. I mean, there is some, there is some old, old, I mean,
[47:44.240 --> 47:49.840]  the Amtrak trains are very clean. I like riding Amtrak, but you know, underneath the seat back
[47:49.840 --> 47:56.000]  there, they don't, they don't hose those, they don't hose those areas down. I kissed that cap
[47:56.000 --> 48:03.840]  up to the Amtrak gods. God bless you. All right. Let me thank here our next sponsor to our good
[48:03.840 --> 48:08.080]  friends at Mack Weldon. Well, wouldn't you know it? I'm wearing a Mack Weldon polo shirt right
[48:08.080 --> 48:12.800]  now. It's heating up outside. And when it comes to stylist essentials, perfect for hotter days,
[48:12.800 --> 48:17.680]  there's no better option than Mack Weldon from hanging at home to that much needed vacation.
[48:18.320 --> 48:23.120]  The conference room to the happy hour, Mack Weldon has you covered. Their innovative daily
[48:23.120 --> 48:28.560]  wear system takes the guesswork out of getting dressed even for the most indecisive of guys.
[48:28.560 --> 48:35.040]  You go to mackweldon.com slash the talk show pod, mackweldon.com, the talk show pod,
[48:35.040 --> 48:40.480]  and you'll save 20% on your first order. 20%. They're premium polos. That's what I've got on
[48:40.480 --> 48:44.560]  right now. Easily elevate your plans with fabric technology they built in to keep you comfortable
[48:44.560 --> 48:50.480]  as the temperature rises. They're lightweight silver peak polo and the new super soft Pima
[48:50.480 --> 48:56.000]  t-shirt polo. I don't have that one. The Pima t-shirt polo are great for summer. I love them.
[48:56.000 --> 49:01.280]  They've got shorts. They've got all sorts of other stuff for the summer too. And I really do. They
[49:01.280 --> 49:07.680]  just got great stuff. The stuff they have that they say uses like an odor repellent or absorbent
[49:08.240 --> 49:12.400]  technology. That sounds like bullshit to me. If you would have told me that when I was a kid,
[49:12.400 --> 49:17.360]  I would have thought, oh, come on. I'm telling you, this stuff works. I don't know.
[49:17.360 --> 49:19.200]  Brian Kardell It does. It completely does.
[49:19.200 --> 49:27.760]  Brian Kardell It really does. If I had to choose, I love Mack Weldon's stuff in the winter. Let's
[49:27.760 --> 49:31.280]  rule out the slippers. They're not talking slippers, but rule out all the other stuff.
[49:31.280 --> 49:36.400]  I'd probably rather have them only in the summer than in the winter, even though I do love their
[49:36.400 --> 49:41.600]  winter stuff because of this odor repellent stuff. I'm telling you, you feel fresher at the end of a
[49:41.600 --> 49:46.640]  hot, sweaty day than you do wearing just like plain cotton. I'm telling you that these fabric
[49:46.640 --> 49:51.440]  people are working wonders with technology. Don't sell them short. Anyway, they've got shorts,
[49:51.440 --> 49:56.960]  polos, t-shirts, everything you need for the summer. Once again, mackweldon.com slash
[49:56.960 --> 50:05.680]  the talk show pod. That's a new code, the talk show pod. And that code, 20% off your first order,
[50:05.680 --> 50:12.000]  20%. So go buy some clothes. Next on my list, I guess we could talk self repair kit, right?
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.720]  I've been right. I wrote about that. I honestly thought I was losing my mind. I know I put it in
[50:16.720 --> 50:22.320]  my article about Sean Hollister's piece at the verge. I honest to God, I said that I could not
[50:22.320 --> 50:26.800]  tell if I was being pranked or joked as the sarcasm because it seems to me like the Apple
[50:26.800 --> 50:33.040]  self repair program is exactly what people have been asking for for this whole 10, 15 year stretch
[50:33.040 --> 50:39.920]  of, hey, this kind of stinks that people can't, there's no good way to repair your own Apple stuff
[50:39.920 --> 50:45.200]  when it's out of warranty or just do something like replace a cracked screen or, hey, my phone
[50:45.200 --> 50:48.960]  is great. Everything's great about it except the battery. I've been using this thing for two and a
[50:48.960 --> 50:52.640]  half years or three years and the batteries isn't as good as it used to be. I just need a new
[50:52.640 --> 50:58.880]  battery. Shouldn't I be able to do it at home if I want to? And they've made this program where they
[50:58.880 --> 51:03.920]  send you all of the professional tools, like seriously, like thousands of dollars, like $1,500
[51:03.920 --> 51:09.120]  in professional tools to do the job as well as if you follow their instructions, as well as it gets
[51:09.120 --> 51:14.960]  done in the Apple store. And now here come the articles and they say, this stinks. I don't get
[51:14.960 --> 51:22.720]  it. I don't get it. I mean, am I the only, you know, a couple people wrote to me and said, Hey,
[51:22.720 --> 51:25.920]  I thought I was the only one who thought I was losing my mind when the Verge ran that story.
[51:25.920 --> 51:29.920]  But yeah, if Apple's going to do something that seems like they're going to do it,
[51:29.920 --> 51:34.160]  like this is the thing you need, right? This is the one thing that you need and it's going to
[51:34.160 --> 51:37.280]  cover everything. And we're just going to, we're going to ship this one thing and there, there you
[51:37.280 --> 51:44.800]  go. You got, you got your stuff, right? And that's what they did. And it does happen to, you know,
[51:44.800 --> 51:49.280]  it does happen to be a lot bigger than you'd think for just whatever the one thing is that
[51:49.280 --> 51:55.840]  you're trying to do, but that's not really what it's for. Hollister literally wrote,
[51:55.840 --> 52:01.840]  I expected Apple would send me a small italics box of screwdrivers, spudgers, and pliers.
[52:01.840 --> 52:08.080]  If that was the case, that you could just do it with a spudger, do the proper job with a spudger,
[52:08.080 --> 52:13.680]  pliers, and a couple of screwdrivers, there wouldn't even need to be a self-repair program.
[52:13.680 --> 52:18.640]  They would just, you know, and I know that's the one thing people have pointed out after I wrote
[52:18.640 --> 52:24.160]  my article that, that iFixit will sell you a kit that kind of is just a bunch of spudgers and
[52:24.160 --> 52:32.080]  screwdrivers and pliers, and that you can, you know, some people, you can repair, swap a battery out of an iPhone
[52:32.080 --> 52:37.200]  using things like that, but that's not the right way to do the job. And a lot of the people who told
[52:37.200 --> 52:41.280]  me that they've done it, and they're not even angry people, but, but then they mentioned things like,
[52:41.280 --> 52:45.520]  yeah, you know, like the seal isn't as good as, you know, like a factory seal, but it's good, you know,
[52:45.520 --> 52:49.040]  it's good enough for me or good enough for this iPhone that, that my kid now uses because it's
[52:49.040 --> 52:53.440]  three and a half years old. It's like the point is when you go to Apple, if you go to the Apple
[52:53.440 --> 52:57.360]  store and say, I would like to get this battery replaced, then, you know, I guess you need an
[52:57.360 --> 53:02.320]  appointment or whatever. And they say, okay, and then you come in and you say, I have an appointment
[53:02.320 --> 53:07.840]  to get this iPhone 11 battery swapped. Then they, you know, you fill out some stuff on an iPad and
[53:07.840 --> 53:13.520]  then you hand it over to one of the geniuses and they say like, come back in 45 minutes or, you
[53:13.520 --> 53:18.480]  know, we can text you or you don't get, you know, it's hard when they, when they have your phone, but,
[53:18.480 --> 53:22.240]  you know, if you have, if you have somebody with you, they could text the person and then you come
[53:22.240 --> 53:28.160]  back and then they show you the phone and the phone looks brand new, you know, or, or, you know,
[53:28.160 --> 53:33.200]  as whatever scratches might've been on the side, but like the seal of the screen, Apple's giving
[53:33.200 --> 53:38.000]  you back this phone that when they give it back to you has the same waterproof and dustproof
[53:38.000 --> 53:42.720]  guarantees that it did when you, when it was brand new. And except now you have a brand new battery
[53:42.720 --> 53:47.440]  in it. That's what they're, you know, nothing less than that would be suitable for an official
[53:47.440 --> 53:52.160]  self-repair program. Right? Like you can't say like, Oh yeah, you could do the official Apple
[53:52.160 --> 53:55.680]  self-repair program, but now, you know, don't get your phone wet. Don't take it out in the rain.
[53:57.920 --> 54:02.880]  People, you know, it's, it's, it's like, it really is like the definition of damned if they do damned
[54:02.880 --> 54:08.000]  if they don't and damned if they do nothing. Right. Like, so for years, for years, people
[54:08.000 --> 54:11.440]  said they should have a repair program. They should have a repair program. Now they said,
[54:11.440 --> 54:16.640]  okay, we have a repair program. And the repair program involves you getting, yes, 79 pounds of
[54:16.640 --> 54:22.880]  professional grade tools and machinery. And in very nice cases, cases that themselves I
[54:22.880 --> 54:28.160]  price them out, look like they could do about $500 worth of Pelican cases to keep this stuff
[54:28.160 --> 54:32.720]  safe during shipping, which Apple pays for the shipping of these 79 pound tools.
[54:32.720 --> 54:36.960]  And, you know, they've got nice wheels, you know, so you can, you know, because they weigh 79
[54:36.960 --> 54:41.440]  pounds, you know, you can wheel them around to get them where you need them. If Apple instead just
[54:41.440 --> 54:46.000]  sent you a couple of spudgers and pliers and screwdrivers people, you know, the articles would
[54:46.000 --> 54:52.000]  say Apple's self-repair program doesn't give you the tools to do the job properly. I don't see,
[54:53.280 --> 54:56.960]  my question is what should Apple have done differently? And I can't come up with anything.
[54:56.960 --> 55:02.000]  This seems like it's like the perfect, I almost worry that it's a sign of how cynical our whole
[55:02.000 --> 55:07.760]  industry has gotten of, you know, anything, any, it's like anything now that, you know,
[55:07.760 --> 55:14.160]  there's this big tech rubric and anything, any of these big tech companies do is immediately
[55:14.160 --> 55:19.040]  viewed with cynicism and that it must be, it must be cynical. It must be, there must be some catch
[55:19.040 --> 55:23.840]  to this. And, and I think, you know, sometimes well, weirdly, weirdly, they're cynical about
[55:23.840 --> 55:29.360]  some things, but they're not, they're, you know, I think about the Virgin particular and when the
[55:30.560 --> 55:39.520]  essential phone was first being rumored and first, you know, going around before the thing actually
[55:39.520 --> 55:44.960]  shipped and they were, they were gaga over the essential phone. And yet when this thing comes
[55:44.960 --> 55:49.280]  out, this is a big problem we have to talk about. Wait, what was wrong with the essential phone?
[55:50.480 --> 55:54.880]  That's not the one that was like Legos. That's the one from Andy, Andy Ruben.
[55:54.880 --> 56:00.960]  Yeah. Right. Andy Ruben. So they, no, they were, they, they were wide-eyed and just like,
[56:00.960 --> 56:04.000]  Oh my gosh, the essential, this is like, there's this new thing it's coming. It's
[56:04.000 --> 56:10.480]  Andy Ruben. It's going to be, you know, and see me to my eye, very uncritical about the whole idea.
[56:10.480 --> 56:15.280]  Right. Right. Yeah. I agree. Yeah. Boy, that didn't work out.
[56:15.280 --> 56:17.760]  And the thing is like, they're not making you buy this equipment.
[56:17.760 --> 56:21.760]  No, they said, they said, Oh yeah, you want to change your battery. You got to,
[56:21.760 --> 56:27.120]  you got to spend $5,000 on them, but these boxes of Pelican boxes full of equipment.
[56:27.120 --> 56:34.400]  But they will sell them to you. So, you know, like, you know, and so like, I don't, I take,
[56:34.400 --> 56:39.680]  I'm trying, my position is sort of a middle ground. Like I see how the right to repair
[56:41.040 --> 56:46.880]  petitioners have had some, had some good points all along. And I always thought they did. And I
[56:46.880 --> 56:52.400]  do think that their pressure on Apple has forced, you know, not forced Apple, but motivated Apple
[56:52.400 --> 56:57.680]  to do this program before this program. It was either give it to Apple itself or give it to one
[56:57.680 --> 57:04.640]  of Apple's certified Apple repair partners. And now, you know, they're saying, look, anybody can
[57:04.640 --> 57:09.840]  buy this equipment. So like, if you live in rural Montana or Idaho or something like that, you don't
[57:09.840 --> 57:16.400]  live anywhere near an Apple store and there isn't an Apple certified repair center, but there is like
[57:16.400 --> 57:21.120]  a place in town where there's, you know, like a repair your phone shop, you know, which are all
[57:21.120 --> 57:25.440]  over the place, right? Every mall has them at a kiosk, you know, where you can pay less to get
[57:25.440 --> 57:29.840]  third-party replacements of cracked screens and stuff like that for all sorts of phones.
[57:29.840 --> 57:35.600]  Those people, those outfits can buy these same tools for doing this, right? I think that's great.
[57:35.600 --> 57:41.440]  That's a great win that you can buy the actual tools that Apple uses and that Apple certifies
[57:41.440 --> 57:46.240]  and follow Apple's own instructions that use those tools. This is all just a great win. And
[57:46.240 --> 57:50.000]  yet the articles are such complaints about it. I didn't even get to Brian Chen at the New York
[57:50.000 --> 57:55.360]  Times. Did you read that one? I did not read that one. I saw somebody else talking about it though.
[57:55.360 --> 58:00.720]  So Brian, Brian Chen, he, he, the personal technology columnist for the New York Times,
[58:00.720 --> 58:05.920]  whose years long campaign is that people shouldn't worry about the quality of the
[58:05.920 --> 58:12.720]  photos that their picture that their phones take. That's the, the official stance repeatedly across
[58:12.720 --> 58:17.760]  numerous reviews over the years is that normal, everybody out there shouldn't worry about whether
[58:17.760 --> 58:24.560]  a new iPhone would take better photos because I don't know why, which is nonsense. But he,
[58:24.560 --> 58:30.000]  he wrote a column where he got the toolkit and wanted to swap out the battery on an iPhone 12
[58:30.560 --> 58:35.600]  and found the instructions daunting. And again, that's what Apple has said all along,
[58:35.600 --> 58:39.200]  right? It's like, that's part of the complaint is like, Hey, this is all complicated. This is
[58:39.200 --> 58:45.920]  a lot of work. Apple. That's why I stopped doing stuff like that. Exactly. Apple has been saying
[58:45.920 --> 58:51.200]  no for all along, like, why don't they allow, why don't they make it so you can just buy a battery
[58:51.200 --> 58:56.000]  and replace it yourself? And their answer has been, it is, these are very complicated devices
[58:56.000 --> 59:02.160]  that are packed in very, very precisely and require special tools, complicated steps,
[59:02.160 --> 59:07.760]  and much precision and care while doing it to repair properly. And people are like, ah,
[59:07.760 --> 59:11.920]  you know, you're just making money on a battery. You're, you're, you're making money on batteries,
[59:11.920 --> 59:16.080]  which they're not. I I've, I've gotten so many emails from people too, over the years who work
[59:16.080 --> 59:19.440]  at Apple stores who are like, Oh my God, there is no way we make money on these things. Cause
[59:19.440 --> 59:24.480]  people come in and we'll just replace batteries. You know, it's, you know, $69 doesn't even come
[59:24.480 --> 59:28.880]  close to, you know, you know, it's like an hour of somebody's work. It's, you know, it's a great
[59:28.880 --> 59:33.520]  deal. It really is a good deal, but people don't believe it. They just think there must be some
[59:33.520 --> 59:39.280]  catch and everything's about making money. And then you actually, they have the program,
[59:39.280 --> 59:43.440]  you get the instructions and the people who've been saying, ah, for all these years are like,
[59:43.440 --> 59:48.320]  Hey, this is complicated and requires precision. And it seems like you kind of need practice and
[59:48.320 --> 59:52.640]  training to do it, you know, easily. And I don't know what to do. And it's like, that's what Apple
[59:52.640 --> 59:56.960]  has been saying for years about why they don't do this. It's exactly it. And they act like Apple
[59:56.960 --> 01:00:03.360]  never said it. It's, you know what I mean? It's like, if you go buy a slice of pizza and the guy
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:07.040]  is like, Hey, Hey, that's going to be super hot. You better wait. And then you take a bite right
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:11.440]  away. And you're like, Hey, I just burnt my tongue, burnt the roof of my mouth. The guy
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:18.160]  just told you that. Uh, so Brian Chen has an iPhone 12. I don't know if it was a mini or not,
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:23.440]  it doesn't matter, but he wants to swap the battery. And he enlisted the help of a friend
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:28.880]  who in San Francisco, who does repairs and he's helped Brian Chen with other devices over the
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:35.120]  years, got his help. And the friend had a spare iPhone 12, a broken one. And they were like,
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.720]  well, let's, you know, practice on this one. That's actually a broken iPhone 12,
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:42.560]  but it's the same size. We can use the same tools and we'll open it up. And they opened it up and
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:48.560]  it's like, okay, I think we got it. Let's operate on the real one. And they, Chen puts the phone
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:53.840]  and it's like step one is take the screws out. And then step two is you put it in like the
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:59.520]  little easy bake oven to warm it up, to get the glue soft. And then you take the screen off.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:04.000]  Well, he puts it in the easy bake oven and starts prying the screen off. And the guy's like, Whoa,
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.720]  whoa. Would you take the screws out? And he's like, Oh, I forgot. Well, it turns out he broke,
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:13.440]  he broke the screen cause he didn't take the screws out, melted it and lifted the screen
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.800]  and then blames Apple. Right. I swear to God they, and then they go through with the repair.
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.720]  They still swap out the battery, put it all back together. And now the screen's all
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:30.080]  jacked because he pried it out while the screws were connected, you know, and it's Apple's fault.
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:37.120]  I mean, I, you know, you can't make this up. I honestly felt like I was losing my
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:41.120]  mind and I didn't see his story until after I was like, all right, I got to write about this
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:46.320]  Verge piece from Sean Hollister. And I spent the day writing it. And as soon as I'm done,
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:50.960]  somebody sent me a thing and they were like, Hey, I loved your piece on the Verge self repair thing.
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:55.520]  I don't get these guys like him and Chen with, you know, blaming the tools when it's
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:02:00.080]  clearly their problem. And I'm like, Oh no. Oh no. And I go and look,
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:06.320]  he forgot to take the screws out and pride the screen off and blames Apple
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:10.400]  for the complicated process. I mean, how do you even make that up?
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:18.240]  Yeah. I don't get it. All right. Let me thank, let me thank our last sponsor. We have one more
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:24.160]  sponsor for the show and it's our friends at Collide. K O L I D E. Collide. I used to call
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:29.200]  them Collide, but it's really just Collide, but it is with a K. Collide is a new take on
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:34.560]  endpoint management and here's their fundamental question. How do you get end users more involved
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:38.960]  instead of just telling them what to do? Locking down your employees' devices without considering
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:43.120]  their needs or even attempting to educate them about the security of their laptop.
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:49.200]  It is a system. Collide is built by like-minded security practitioners and they use Slack,
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.960]  which is probably what your team already uses. It's not MDM. It was too disrupting. They saw
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:03:00.800]  it. They used it. They saw how frustrating it was for devices to be locked down, especially laptops,
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:06.480]  and how many employees would just use their personal laptop, which had no MDM and no control
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:10.800]  and none of the security things. It's like, here's your work laptop. It's all locked down.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:14.960]  Nobody wants to use it. And so they use their personal laptop. And what's the point? You're
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:18.480]  not getting anything out of that. Everyone loses. Collide is different. Instead of
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:22.640]  locking down a device, Collide takes a user-focused approach that communicates security
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:27.600]  recommendations to your employees directly on Slack. You just get like a Slack notice and it
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:32.000]  says like, hey, you've got something in your downloads folder and that shouldn't be in your
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.320]  downloads folder. You should put it somewhere secure. It will educate them about your company's
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:42.240]  policies and tell them how to best keep their devices secure using real tangible examples,
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:48.320]  not theoretical scenarios. That's Collide cross-platform endpoint management for Linux,
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:54.160]  Mac, and Windows devices, not just Mac, Linux, Mac, and Windows devices that puts end users

[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.480]  So you're not going to get one of these kits is what I'm hearing.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:30.080]  No, I would sooner, I don't know, start performing. I'd start making my own clothes. I have no
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:36.160]  interest in it. Now, I am lucky. I will say I am lucky. I live blocks away from the Philadelphia
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:41.680]  downtown Apple store. It's very close. So if I ever needed, I cracked an iPhone screen a year
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:47.920]  or two ago, just made an appointment, came in and got the iPhone screen replaced. I get it.
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:54.400]  I'm glad. This is nothing but good news that more people will have these tools and be able to
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:59.520]  perform these repairs. Just with WWDCs coming up, I don't really have much to say about it. I guess
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:04.400]  we know a little bit more about Apple's plans that it is... I don't think they've said how many
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.360]  developers have been invited for the quote special day.
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.640]  No, I didn't see that.
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.040]  But it is more and more clear. It's obvious.
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.360]  They said just a limited number, right? They didn't even...
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:15.280]  Correct. Yeah. I don't think...
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.400]  Going deeper than that.
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:22.080]  Yeah. I don't know why they haven't said. I guess, I don't know. Apple's going to Apple.
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:24.560]  Right.
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:25.920]  I just love it. It's like...
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:29.520]  But I guess that people who are going know that right now, right? Or at least they had
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:32.640]  sent some invitations or sent some responses out.
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:36.640]  Yeah. I think everybody who got in, who won the raffle or the lottery, whatever you want to call
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:42.240]  it, knows and they can make plans. And I guess RSVP and Apple can see if there's people who
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:46.480]  didn't RSVP and maybe invite people from a waiting list. I don't know. But
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:53.600]  still unclear where and how they'll be watching. Is it indoors? Is it outdoors? I
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:58.960]  sort of suspect it has to be outdoors because I don't think they have an indoor facility for as
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:04.080]  many people. I think there's going to be many hundreds of developers, maybe a thousand. I
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:08.320]  would expect a big crowd. So I think that means outside, like Steve Jobs Theater cannot fit a
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:12.000]  thousand people, not even close. So we'll see. I don't really have much to say about it though.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:18.560]  I mean, I'm intrigued by how it goes and intrigued to see how this dev center that apparently will
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:23.200]  be part of their day and something that they can tour, what that'll be like. Don't really have
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:26.880]  anything to add though. I don't... Anything you're expecting from WWDC?
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:30.720]  No, it's a weird... It seems like a kind of a weird year.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:35.600]  As to what if any hardware announcements there might be.
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:40.320]  Yeah. I know some people are sort of hoping... Obviously the big one would be the AR
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:45.920]  goggle thing. Will they announce it in advance and say, this is coming later this year,
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:53.600]  but here's what it's like. And you can start building software for it by using the AR stuff
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:07:00.000]  on iPhones and iPads with LIDAR. Will there be a message like that? I sort of think no,
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:07.280]  because I just don't think that's WWDC. I don't think WWDC is where they would announce a new
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:12.320]  platform. If I were a betting man, and you know I don't like to gamble, John.
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:21.520]  I would gamble or lie. I do not like to lie either, but I would guess that they will not
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:29.040]  unveil any new hardware platforms at WWDC. I still think that Mac Pro is a sleeper.
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:36.560]  I really think that there's a chance that they might announce the M1 Ultra Mac Pro. And I know
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:42.560]  Gurman has said that's a next year thing. It just seems weird to me that there wouldn't be any part
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:48.160]  of... Before they go to the M2 later in the year and start the next generation of Apple Silicon,
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:51.680]  it just seems weird that the Mac Pro would have been... There would be no Pro.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:57.520]  I agree. I mean, I sort of just assumed that there would be one. And then Gurman said,
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:02.080]  no, it's going to start with the... He seems to think it makes more sense to start at the top of
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:06.320]  the M2 and then trickle down to the... Which I find weird.
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:10.480]  Yeah, that doesn't make sense to me. And it just seems to me that... And Apple's a company
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:17.760]  of patterns, but the first thing can always be the abnormal one that doesn't fit the
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:21.680]  eventual pattern. But to me, it makes more sense that the pattern would be,
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:31.760]  the M2 family will follow the M1. We'll see the just plain M2 with no adjective and baseline
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:38.080]  specs. And it'll be in the main product that Apple makes, the MacBook Air, or maybe MacBook
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:43.920]  Airs if they go to two sizes, which would be great, I think. I'd love to see them make
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:52.000]  consumer price laptops in a bigger size or a smaller size or go 11, 13, 15 or something
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.800]  like that or 12, 14, 16, I don't know, but... Or at least two sizes, that would be great.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:03.600]  A new Mac Mini with more capabilities and then roll out from there with updated MacBook Pros,
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:10.960]  eventually a new, I guess, a new 24-inch iMac with the M2 just plain, etcetera and so forth.
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:17.280]  But at some point, you got to work the Mac Pro in. And I just feel, WWDC would be perfect. That's
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:23.680]  when they unveiled the current Mac Pro was at WWDC along with the Pro Display XDR. And they said
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:29.360]  it'll be coming later this year. Maybe it won't be shipping until later in the year. But I feel
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:34.240]  like WWDC is the perfect place to announce it because develop... They're very clear about it.
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:39.840]  One of the biggest markets for buying the top of the line Mac Pros are developers. So
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:43.040]  that seems natural, but it doesn't seem like people are talking about it. Maybe because
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.240]  Germin says next year and so much of our rumor ecosystem comes down to just Germin and Ming-Chi
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:58.720]  Kuo, right? It's like... We've got two people in the world who 90-some percent of the reliable
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:02.640]  Apple rumors come from. So people...
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:09.920]  So it seems weird to be announcing things in opposite speed order, right? It seems like your
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:14.640]  story is a lot easier to tell if you're announcing things. Every time you're announcing something,
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:19.600]  it's faster than the thing that you announced the last time. Whereas if you announce the M2
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:25.120]  Ultra, Max, whatever, before you announce the regular M2, you're like, oh yeah, this is way
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:32.000]  slower than the thing that we announced at WWDC. I am about to gravely gloss over the incredible
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:38.560]  hard work and expertise of Apple's entire Silicon team under Johnny Suruji. But basically, it seems
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:44.400]  like the way they do it is they come out with an M blank, like the M1, and then they just start
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:51.120]  gluing them together. And then you've got one that's two M1s, and that's like the M1 Pro. And
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:55.760]  then you've got... Just glue two more on the bottom, and now you've got like a little square
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:00.880]  of four of them, that's an Ultra. And then maybe they put two Ultras on other sides of a board,
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:04.880]  and that's the Mac Pro. Or maybe they put eight of these Ultras in there and charge you $40,000.
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:11.520]  But you just keep glue... You come out with the M1, the M2, the M3, and you can just glue these
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:16.640]  things together and make faster... That is about as reductive as you can get.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:21.360]  Yeah. I don't know. It doesn't sound that hard to me, but it does seem to me that you can't...
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:26.800]  It just seems... But like you said, it seems backwards to say they're going to announce one
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:33.760]  with eight M2s glued together before they come out with just the plain M2 and a MacBook Air
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:38.080]  with a new design. It seems backwards. There's two guys who won't replace a battery talking.
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:42.480]  I don't even want to unscrew the thing. I don't want to take the screws out.
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:45.120]  No, I don't either. I'm going to mess it up.
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:47.600]  You know how easy it would be to lose those screws with my...
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:49.600]  Oh my God. I lost them already.
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:58.080]  I don't know. And I also think... I do think that the lower in quantity a product is produced,
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:02.800]  the better, for obvious reasons. You don't have to be a freaking brainiac to figure this out,
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:08.560]  that the more niche an Apple product is, the better they are at keeping it secret until they
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:16.080]  unveil it. So the iPhone, which they sell 100 million of a quarter, leaks. Every detail of it
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:19.680]  leaks, except maybe the colors and stuff like that. Because there's just too many of them. There's
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:26.960]  like giant cities in China that are making these things, that are making iPhones. Whereas the Mac
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:32.160]  Pro, they do it... Maybe they're still going to do it in Texas. It's like one factory. It's a lot
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:36.160]  easier to keep something like that under wraps. The best example I can think of is the 24-inch
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:42.320]  iMac, which was a complete surprise. It's like the rumors that there'd be an iMac, but the fact
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:47.280]  that it was so thin and it came in those colors, all of it was a nice surprise. If they could keep
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:53.840]  the iMac 24 under wraps, I totally believe that they could have a Mac Pro ready to announce 10
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:58.480]  days from now, or whatever the date is. And that would be the hardware announcement of WWDC.
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:03.200]  Goggles, that seems to me like a fall thing. Whether it's going to go on sale soon,
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:08.480]  or whether they're going to pull an Apple Watch timeline and say, we're announcing this now,
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:12.960]  we're showing it to you now, we want developers to get started now, but this will be available
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:17.760]  early next year, which means April. I could see that. It just feels like a fall thing.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:24.400]  I could see that too. I would bet on that just because, man, they would want to get
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:30.320]  more things in a row before they ship something like that. And I was skeptical that they would
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:35.760]  be announcing it this summer. It just doesn't seem like there's enough going on around it.
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:40.080]  Like, I know that they apparently showed it to the board and stuff like that, so I guess it's
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:46.240]  getting to the point where it's a real actual thing, but it doesn't seem like it's in huge
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:49.680]  production or anything for sure. Yeah, that was a funny leak, and I wrote about it like,
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:52.800]  God, I would love to know how that leaked, because the story that leaked to
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.640]  Gurman, right? I want to get this right. I think so, yeah.
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.920]  It was either Gurman or Ming-Chi Kuo, because that's...
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:02.240]  Yeah, but that's not the kind of leak that would go to Ming-Chi Kuo.
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:06.640]  No, it wasn't. His stuff comes from Asia, and Gurman's stuff comes from California.
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:11.840]  No, but somehow somebody was aware of the fact that Apple put together a demo of the current
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:15.760]  state of the project for the Apple board, and God, I would love to know how that leaked.
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:23.840]  I mean, I know some people are joking that it's Al Gore, which would be hilarious, really,
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:28.720]  but I just think I'd love to know it. But I don't know that that means that it's imminent, right?
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:34.160]  That it just seems like that's the sort of thing that, oh, yeah, somebody on the board could say,
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:38.320]  like, yeah, big deal. We saw the Apple Watch 18 months before it shipped, and it was a prototype,
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:43.280]  and it didn't work right or had this, that, and the other to come. I don't know that that really
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:47.440]  means anything other than that it's real, and we sort of knew that it's real. The other thing,
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:52.000]  though, that would be a big tell, I think, would be if the only hardware might be the Mac Pro,
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:58.480]  there's no news of any AR-specific hardware, but if the developer news of the year
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:04.640]  involves lots of new AR stuff for the iPhone and iPad, right? And then it would be like,
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:08.400]  yeah, gee, I wonder why they're trying to… Yeah, what's this for?
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:15.680]  Yeah, why is Mike Rockwell up there talking about ARKit 3? In my opinion, I just think
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:20.080]  it's cool, and I've used it, and it's a nice toy, and the measuring thing is a neat gimmick,
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:24.000]  but for the most part, people, as far as I can tell, aren't really doing
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.440]  lots of AR stuff in the real world with their iPhones and iPads.
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:33.600]  But that doesn't mean that it's a waste of Apple's effort that they've been building ARKit up over
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:39.840]  the last few years. It just seems like it's sort of like getting developers into this and building
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:50.400]  stuff into their iOS apps with future AR-native hardware in mind. I think that's pretty clear.
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:16:00.240]  Only the last thing on my list for the day is to toast the iPod. So this is my first show since the
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:05.520]  demise of the iPod Touch, the last iPod. Yeah, which is sort of an iPod in name only,
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:12.880]  right? I mean, it's an iPhone without the phone part, so in that regard, and it plays music. But
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:18.000]  the iPod iPod was discontinued quite a while ago.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  Yeah, there was a couple articles. It's always a good time to look back, but it is funny. One thing
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.280]  that sticks out to me is how brief the iPod era really was, right? So it came out in 2001,
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:35.280]  famously right after 9-11. That's how I remember. It was sort of a niche Mac-only product for two
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:39.360]  years. Then around 2003 is when they moved to Windows.
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:41.360]  God, it was that long. It was two years.
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:46.560]  I think it was two years. It really exploded in popularity at that point. I think
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.560]  a combination... Obviously, going to Windows...
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:51.440]  Things moved slower back then. Things moved slower.
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.320]  Well, some things...
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:53.840]  Technology moved slower, right?
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:17:00.240]  Some things moved slower and some moved faster. It still blows my mind when I did that a couple
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:05.040]  months ago and wrote that timeline of the original iPhone project. It still blows my mind that they
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:10.640]  went from, okay, let's do it. Let's build our own friggin' phone to Steve Jobs holding it up to six
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:16.240]  months later me having one in my hand from an Apple store. It was like two years. That's kind
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:23.040]  of crazy. But other stuff did go slow, right? It was funny. Somebody had a gallery of all the
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:27.920]  iPods over the years. You know which one I always forget? I always forget the white one that had
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:37.120]  the four buttons above the click wheel that were in a row. It's like, I don't know. I never liked
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:41.520]  that one because it seemed to me like... Those were touch buttons, right? I think I had that
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:43.200]  one. I probably still have it here someplace.
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:48.800]  I don't know. It was like just having a wheel that you could click seemed so elegant and putting
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:53.600]  buttons on top of it sort of seemed... I don't know. It almost seemed like a knockoff iPod.
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.880]  It seemed contrary to the original Spirit.
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:02.000]  There definitely were a lot of them and in a myriad of designs,
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:11.440]  compared to the phone, which has always been a rectangle with a screen that... Obviously,
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:16.720]  the design dictates the fact that it's not going to change very much.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:23.040]  Well, or compared to the watch to bring this episode full circle. This is a professional
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:28.880]  podcast. Right now, we're bringing it full circle. But the fact that you could take the original
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:34.640]  Apple Watch Series Zero and at arm's length not really tell it apart from today's Apple Watch,
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:41.520]  you know, they really nailed the basic form factor with Apple Watch, whereas the iPods really were
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:47.360]  such a playground for industrial design. It wasn't like that the original was a bad design,
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:53.600]  but the fact that like just a few years into the iPods relatively brief life cycle of relevance,
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:19:00.160]  right? 2001 introduction, two years of obscurity, a couple of years as like a smash pop culture hit,
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:04.240]  and then the iPhone came out and it was like, why do I need an iPod? And I know there's lots
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:07.760]  and lots of people who still use our iPods for other reasons and don't want to just have their
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:11.760]  $1,000 phone playing their music if they go running and blah, blah, blah. But for the most
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:17.520]  part, once the iPhone came out, the writing was on the wall like, oh, yeah, this is the one thing
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:22.880]  in my pocket that'll play all my music and all this other stuff. It's just so interesting that
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:28.960]  even in that brief period, it went through the transition of, isn't this amazing? We have a 1.8
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:33.920]  inch spinning hard drive that nobody else knows what to do, and we can put 5,000 songs on this
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:39.280]  thing that's the size of a deck of cards. And within like four years, there was an iPod Nano
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:44.880]  with flash memory, and you could stack like eight of them in the space of an original iPod.
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:52.320]  Yeah. Yeah, I had a Rio, I think before, yeah, it was a Rio before the iPod came out,
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:55.520]  which I used for quite a while, but it was always such a pain because you had like,
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:01.840]  you know, it has a tiny little flash, you know, media in it. And I had to swap songs out. It
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:07.040]  would hold like 30 songs at most. And it was constantly just like, I'm tired of this song.
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:10.400]  I got to connect it to the computer again, and I got to change, you know, move things around.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:15.440]  And then you get the iPod and it's like, oh, no, I'm just going to throw it all on there.
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:20.720]  Amy had one that held like 11 songs. It was really, really tight, but she loved it. She
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:24.240]  loved it. But you know, every day you'd be like, oh yeah, well, it was so much better than carrying
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:28.720]  like a tape, you know, tape or a disc, you know, like a CD player or something like that.
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:32.400]  Well, that's it. That's it for me, John. It was good to have you. My thanks to you. I
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:54.800]  always love talking to you. Force be with you. Force be with you as well.
