[00:00.000 --> 00:02.080]  You're a bad influence, Jason Snell.
[00:02.080 --> 00:08.400]  I am. I have, I've sent you down so many rabbit holes and sent you after so many wild gooses.
[00:09.120 --> 00:12.960]  You've cost me a fortune in keyboards, most of which I don't use.
[00:13.680 --> 00:14.880]  Yeah, same.
[00:16.880 --> 00:23.920]  You know, I was looking at the, speaking of keyboards, I have the Keychron K2 from a couple
[00:23.920 --> 00:28.800]  years ago, and apparently there's a new K2, but you would think this is what gets me about these
[00:28.800 --> 00:33.920]  damn keyboard companies. You would think if the name of your product is the Keychron, that's the
[00:33.920 --> 00:39.680]  company, the K2, that's the, that's a fine name for a keyboard, whatever, it's, you know, but you
[00:39.680 --> 00:46.000]  would think if you update it, it would become the K3 or, or the L2 or something, you know, upgrade
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.200]  the letter, upgrade the number, but apparently there's a new K2, which you just have to know.
[00:51.200 --> 00:54.800]  Because there's also a K3 and a K4, like they're all the different sizes is what they do.
[00:54.800 --> 01:00.320]  Yes, right. It's a size thing, not a model thing. Anyway, there's a, there's a Q2.
[01:01.760 --> 01:07.680]  I have the Q1 here. That is what I'm using right now. I just, Mike Hurley made it for me on his
[01:07.680 --> 01:12.240]  live streams that he does where he does keyboard stuff. Cause he's, I got him into it a little bit
[01:12.240 --> 01:16.800]  and he just went down the rabbit hole to the point where it's literally his hobby now. But he made
[01:16.800 --> 01:22.000]  this for me and sent it to me. So I've got a new keyboard today. That's, it's pretty, it's very
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.320]  weighty. They carved it out of aluminum and it feels solid. I am impressed by that.
[01:26.320 --> 01:31.600]  So I was looking at the Q2 and I thought, well, I don't want it cause it's not Bluetooth. And if
[01:31.600 --> 01:36.560]  I'm going to have a wire, I'm just going to use my Apple extended keyboard too. But I showed it
[01:36.560 --> 01:44.560]  to my son Jonas and he's become a mechanical keyboard aficionado. And not, not through my
[01:44.560 --> 01:48.400]  encouragement, if anything, I would have encouraged him to get into programming or something actually
[01:48.400 --> 01:54.400]  useful, not something expensive. Yeah. Expensive and just uses a lot of plastic.
[01:54.400 --> 02:02.560]  Right. But spent his own Christmas money to get one and to add to his keyboard collection.
[02:02.560 --> 02:10.880]  And in addition also bought a set of different switches. This is how into it he is. So not just
[02:10.880 --> 02:15.760]  swapping out the key caps, but swatching, swapping out the switches for some kind of,
[02:15.760 --> 02:19.440]  I think it's an optical switch. I actually should have written it down, but I don't know.
[02:19.440 --> 02:23.760]  Yeah. The, um, the Q series from key cron, the, my understanding talking to Mike, especially is
[02:23.760 --> 02:29.200]  that they're there. It's like a commercialized version of what the hobbyists have been doing.
[02:29.200 --> 02:36.080]  So it's not as fancy as the hobbyist keyboards, but it's more fancy than the, the K line. And so
[02:36.080 --> 02:42.320]  their idea is they're using their ability to mass produce to kind of like maybe be a, like a starter
[02:42.320 --> 02:46.800]  keyboard for people who are interested in swapping switches and stuff like that. It's an interesting
[02:46.800 --> 02:52.480]  idea that, that the economics of the keyboard market, I actually talking to Mike about how
[02:52.480 --> 02:55.840]  oftentimes you get in these group buys where you're waiting for your keyboard or your key
[02:55.840 --> 02:59.840]  caps for like six months or a year or a year and a half. I think if you're a key cron and you're
[02:59.840 --> 03:04.080]  like, well, what if we could make something that's kind of like that and have it in stock?
[03:05.600 --> 03:09.520]  Like people could get it right now. And I think that's their game there. Um,
[03:09.520 --> 03:14.320]  but yeah, you have one now. So yeah, it worked. And the big difference, the nice big difference
[03:14.320 --> 03:20.320]  I'll just, before we move on and get off the subject, but the, the Q2 has an aluminum base
[03:20.320 --> 03:26.240]  or some kind of metal base and it makes all the difference in the world. Uh, it's, it's like,
[03:26.240 --> 03:32.480]  you think like it's all about the switches, but it really is a, it's no wonder that at one point in
[03:32.480 --> 03:37.760]  the company's history, Apple made absolutely wonderful mechanical keyboards. And when they
[03:37.760 --> 03:41.920]  get it all together now, even though they don't make mechanical keyboards and haven't for decades,
[03:42.800 --> 03:47.760]  when they get their magic keyboards, right, they are good keyboards. It's a holistic whole,
[03:47.760 --> 03:53.680]  you know, the base and the weight and, and how the, I don't know what you call it, the thing
[03:53.680 --> 03:59.760]  under it's where the switches plug in, but if it gives a little, it gives everything a better feel.
[03:59.760 --> 04:05.280]  And the Q2 is a wonderful feeling keyboard. It really is. I mean, I think it's like 160 bucks,
[04:05.280 --> 04:09.200]  so it should, but yeah, yeah, they're, they're good. And then you could do stuff to them.
[04:09.200 --> 04:14.160]  That's the thing. Mike, what Mike did is he like, he like taped the back of the, of the,
[04:14.160 --> 04:20.240]  of the board and put in some like filler, like insulation, basically to do some sound dampening.
[04:20.960 --> 04:24.320]  And then I tried it and I thought it was a little weird and he said, well, let's take out some of
[04:24.320 --> 04:27.840]  the, he walked me through like opening it back up and we took out some of the insulation. And
[04:27.840 --> 04:31.200]  then I was like, Oh, this sounds better now. And he's like, that's what you want is, you know,
[04:31.200 --> 04:37.120]  you can make all these adjustments to make it more resonant or less resonant or whatever. So it's,
[04:37.120 --> 04:42.320]  you can, it's a rabbit hole. People can go down. I I'm, I was talking about this on a walk with
[04:42.320 --> 04:48.640]  my wife the other day, we were walking the dog and I said you know, I, I care. I feel like I'm
[04:49.440 --> 04:53.840]  the person who uses it for their job. And so is interested. Like if you're,
[04:53.840 --> 04:58.560]  if you're a woodworker, you've got tools that you care about more than the average person,
[04:58.560 --> 05:02.000]  whatever those tools might be, or, or, you know, any think of any profession,
[05:02.000 --> 05:05.120]  you've got tools that you care about more than the average person because you do this for your
[05:05.120 --> 05:09.600]  living. But then there's the person who like collects those tools. And that is a level that
[05:09.600 --> 05:14.560]  I'm not interested in going into, but I, so I care way more than the average person does about
[05:14.560 --> 05:19.440]  keyboards, but I have not fallen down that rabbit hole and that Mike fell down and he's having a
[05:19.440 --> 05:23.280]  good time. So I it's great. It's just, it doesn't interest me to get into that level of detail.
[05:23.280 --> 05:27.280]  I just want some pretty keys and I want my keys to sound good and look good. And that's all.
[05:27.280 --> 05:32.560]  Yeah. You know, there is something there, you know, it, it, if you like the way your keyboard
[05:32.560 --> 05:37.760]  feels and you're supposed to be pressing keys, you know, whatever your job is, writer, programmer,
[05:37.760 --> 05:42.000]  whatever it is that you do, if it involves you pressing keys on a computer keyboard,
[05:42.000 --> 05:46.880]  if they feel fun to press, it makes you want to get to work to some degree, right? There's,
[05:48.320 --> 05:50.880]  it's like a little gentle nudge of, Hey, get to work.
[05:51.440 --> 05:55.440]  That's why I have not a lot of patience for people who are like, Oh, you guys talking about
[05:55.440 --> 05:59.120]  your fiddly keyboards and all that. It's like, well, it is, it is literally how I make my living.
[05:59.120 --> 06:03.120]  I mean, I guess microphones too. I have to worry about that. And you, you and I both now have to
[06:03.120 --> 06:07.200]  worry about microphones and things, but like keyboard it's, it's part of our identity and
[06:07.200 --> 06:12.240]  part of our profession. And so it does matter to a certain degree. And you can, you can,
[06:12.240 --> 06:17.040]  I don't want to say overdo it, but like you can totally obsess over it. And if you do that and
[06:17.040 --> 06:23.040]  it's fun for you, then great. But it does on a level like matter, like I get more pleasure
[06:23.040 --> 06:28.800]  out of using a good tool to do my job and it makes a difference. Like I am more productive. And I
[06:28.800 --> 06:34.560]  know you talk about the Apple extended keyboards that you've got. And you know, you're, you're
[06:34.560 --> 06:40.560]  going back to an old, old, old keyboard, but the point still stands, which is it is the tool that
[06:40.560 --> 06:46.240]  you want to use. That's it. The other thing, it is funny though, as somebody, I keep saying,
[06:46.240 --> 06:53.040]  we're going to move on, but it's funny because, because there was this decade plus long period
[06:53.040 --> 06:57.840]  where it's not like mechanical keyboards ever disappeared from the market, but they were really
[06:57.840 --> 07:04.240]  obscure for awhile. Like it was like factory stopped making like in that interregnum,
[07:04.240 --> 07:08.480]  like Matthias was one of the only companies that was really like marketing mechanical keyboards
[07:08.480 --> 07:15.760]  for a long time. And they had the Alps switches that were like the classic Mac switches and they
[07:15.760 --> 07:21.040]  couldn't get them anymore because the factory shut down and they're like, we don't. And they
[07:21.040 --> 07:24.320]  ended up building their own switches and there, but there was like a year where you couldn't buy
[07:24.320 --> 07:28.240]  their keyboards because they were like, we don't, we can't, we can't make them. And I think on the
[07:28.240 --> 07:33.360]  IBM keyboard front, people were making those buckling spring switches still too. And that
[07:33.360 --> 07:38.560]  like Rich Siegel who writes BB edit, that's his baby. That's what he does is the buckling spring
[07:38.560 --> 07:42.320]  thing I believe. And, and he's a believer in that. And he's always been able to get those,
[07:42.320 --> 07:47.520]  but you're right. There was this period where it was really thin. And I think it's because
[07:47.520 --> 07:51.360]  a lot of those factories were just shutting down because nobody wanted those switches anymore.
[07:51.360 --> 07:56.080]  And now there's been this Renaissance where suddenly, Oh, there is actually a market for fancy
[07:56.080 --> 08:01.440]  like gamers, but also kind of, you know, hipsters who are, who are driving it.
[08:01.440 --> 08:08.000]  I remember I had an internship in college, 96 or so 95, 96 at a windows software developer
[08:08.000 --> 08:15.280]  and here in Philly. And one of the engineers was a buckling spring fan. I think that's the M I
[08:15.280 --> 08:21.200]  forget what the official name was, but he had, you know, he, he was to those IBM buckling spring
[08:21.200 --> 08:26.400]  keyboards, what I am to the extended keyboard to like, he kept two of them in his office at work,
[08:26.400 --> 08:32.640]  had more at home, but what if something happens, right. And he happened to be like the, he was like
[08:32.640 --> 08:39.360]  the, the 10 X engineer, like, and was particularly good at fixing bugs. So like, as we got near like
[08:39.360 --> 08:44.880]  a shipping thing, like he, you just hear his office, you know, but it was, it was satisfying,
[08:44.880 --> 08:48.480]  you know, some people might be annoyed by that, but it was a nice, you know, mid nineties,
[08:49.840 --> 08:54.960]  pre cubicle farm everywhere. Everybody, including me, the intern had an office. My, my office was
[08:54.960 --> 09:00.160]  more like a closet, but I had a door, which felt, you know, very luxurious as a college intern,
[09:00.160 --> 09:04.400]  but like hearing the noise coming out of his office, it was like, oh, he's fixing bugs.
[09:06.000 --> 09:09.200]  Yeah. Whatever those key presses are, they're good. That's good stuff. Anyway,
[09:09.200 --> 09:15.360]  your bad influence on me now is that you've opened the door to a thing that I didn't know existed,
[09:15.360 --> 09:23.200]  which is a way to run old, very old max using an SD card to load everything.
[09:23.200 --> 09:26.000]  Yep. Yeah. I fell down this route,
[09:26.000 --> 09:30.560]  Kieran. So Kieran Healy, who you may know, he's been on and he's a, he's a professor
[09:32.080 --> 09:39.440]  at Duke. Yeah. And he has an se 30 in his office with a style writer and it, and it runs and it
[09:39.440 --> 09:46.880]  runs everything and a very impressive, and I've got a bunch of old max here and I kept thinking,
[09:46.880 --> 09:51.440]  I've got to like, I've got to do something with this. I want to run, like, I've got a
[09:51.440 --> 09:56.800]  Power Mac G4 that will run OS 9 and then many early versions of OS 10. And I like having that
[09:56.800 --> 10:02.080]  around, but I've got, I've got my wife's college computer, which was a, an original Mac upgraded
[10:02.080 --> 10:08.160]  to a plus internally. And it's still sitting here and the hard drive died, but the, the Mac still
[10:08.160 --> 10:13.920]  boots, or at least it turns on and then asks for a floppy drive. And I have no 400 K floppies
[10:13.920 --> 10:21.280]  laying around as it turns out, but there are. Bless him. There are hobbyists again, people who
[10:21.280 --> 10:26.080]  love this stuff who have essentially are using like raspberry pies and things like that. Like
[10:26.080 --> 10:32.640]  lots of really modern, cool technology to build custom bridges to the old software. So
[10:33.360 --> 10:39.840]  the one I'm using is called a floppy emu or M U probably, but it's spelled like emu. And there's
[10:39.840 --> 10:44.880]  one, there are a couple of them that do SCSI as well for somewhat more recent Macs than the,
[10:44.880 --> 10:52.000]  than the earliest Macs. And they basically, you put them together. They, you can have the fun
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.840]  version that you solder, or you can order one pre-made and you attach it to the back of an
[10:55.840 --> 11:01.440]  old Mac and you put in an SD card. And in fact, this one, it's got a little screen and some
[11:01.440 --> 11:05.600]  buttons. So you actually click through on the screen. This thing has more power than the Mac
[11:05.600 --> 11:09.840]  does. Right. Right. Probably more pixels, but it's not even close. I was, I was going to say,
[11:09.840 --> 11:14.880]  it's the, it's a way more powerful computer, but you can click through and pick which disc image
[11:14.880 --> 11:20.800]  you want. And you're like, okay, system to 400 K disc image. And the, the Mac, the question mark
[11:20.800 --> 11:25.200]  suddenly turns into a happy Mac and in you are, and you're running that version and then you shut
[11:25.200 --> 11:30.720]  down and, and it, and it comes back up on the little screen and you can pick a different disc.
[11:30.720 --> 11:36.400]  And since given the firmware of my wife's particular computer, I actually was able to
[11:36.400 --> 11:43.760]  boot it into HD 20 mode, which was Apple's 20 megabyte hard drive of the era. And, and you
[11:43.760 --> 11:49.920]  can load that up with all sorts of software and on the Mac side to load it up with software. Like
[11:49.920 --> 11:55.760]  I got a SD card with some software already on it, but it's all available on the internet and
[11:55.760 --> 12:02.480]  there's a Mac emulator, a classic Mac emulator that will read those disc images and let you
[12:02.480 --> 12:08.960]  basically drag and drop stuff into it. And so I, I, my wife's first message to me when I showed her
[12:08.960 --> 12:14.160]  this, I texted her at work, she said, well, but does it run Tetris? I didn't have Tetris on the
[12:14.160 --> 12:18.400]  disc image. So I had to go download Tetris and put it on. And then I sent her a video of me playing
[12:18.400 --> 12:23.760]  Tetris with that original Mac, which is a it's great. So yeah, it's just amazing that modern
[12:23.760 --> 12:29.040]  technology is so advanced now that all this stuff that was kind of like so old that it was out of
[12:29.040 --> 12:33.680]  reach, like 400 K floppies. Now it's like, yeah, you don't really need a 400 K floppy anymore. You
[12:33.680 --> 12:39.760]  just put an SD card on there. That's got thousands of discs on it. If you want it to it's, it's sort
[12:39.760 --> 12:44.960]  of like the end of, I actually haven't seen it in quite a long time, but it's vaguely how I remember
[12:44.960 --> 12:51.200]  the end of Steven Spielberg's AI where the, in the future, it's like the, the robots we've created,
[12:51.200 --> 12:56.960]  they just exist to keep us going. And they're way more advanced than we ever were, but they're just
[12:56.960 --> 13:01.360]  there to keep the world, keep the world going. Yeah. And to, and sort of like looking at this,
[13:01.360 --> 13:06.400]  this lost robot is like, well, you know, we can do some emulation and keep them running and all that.
[13:06.400 --> 13:11.200]  I love the ingenuity of it to take this old stuff and give it new life. And, you know, it's just
[13:11.200 --> 13:15.200]  like video game emulators and all that. The idea that you have literally every, you can, you can
[13:15.200 --> 13:19.440]  get a raspberry pie with an SD card on it that has literally every video game ever made for a
[13:19.440 --> 13:25.280]  platform and for multiple platforms. And it's all just in this little tiny box. Well, the Mac,
[13:25.280 --> 13:29.040]  you can do that. Biggest problem I'm having right now is that Apple over the years has made so many
[13:29.040 --> 13:35.120]  non-standard video out ports that I'm struggling finding ways to convert this so that I can have
[13:35.120 --> 13:41.520]  these Macs that don't have their built-in display actually go on a screen somewhere. So that's,
[13:41.520 --> 13:46.320]  it's like when I was doing the Apple two thing a few years ago, trying to get all my old discs
[13:46.320 --> 13:51.120]  imaged, you know, that from high school and stuff, it was the hardest part was finding a way to do a
[13:51.120 --> 13:55.120]  composite video out. And that was a standard composite cable, but I did, I no longer had any
[13:55.120 --> 14:00.720]  non-digital TVs. So, um, it's a similar kind of problem where I'm trying to figure out, can I
[14:00.720 --> 14:06.720]  convert from, uh, for the G4, it's like, can I convert from ADC? You can, you got, you can find
[14:06.720 --> 14:13.280]  converters on eBay. They cost like 50 bucks and old Mac video out from like the two CI days.
[14:13.280 --> 14:17.200]  I'm not quite sure what I'm going to do there. So to get it to VGA or something,
[14:17.200 --> 14:21.440]  I don't know. What do you think the odds are that 20 years ago, right? You know, maybe probably
[14:21.440 --> 14:25.920]  roughly around when you and I first met at least online that you, I would have convinced you that
[14:25.920 --> 14:36.000]  in 2022, you'd be talking on my internet radio show about Scuzzy in the present tense, very low.
[14:37.280 --> 14:40.640]  I wouldn't have believed it. You probably would have guessed it was an emulation thing though.
[14:40.640 --> 14:45.120]  Well, I was shocked that when I bought this G4 on eBay, that it has a Scuzzy card in it. And I'm
[14:45.120 --> 14:50.080]  like, Oh, I could actually just plug, I've had a Scuzzy drive in my office at Mac world. And then
[14:50.080 --> 14:54.080]  I brought it home when I left Mac world that somebody sent me, I was talking and I don't
[14:54.080 --> 14:59.840]  remember who it was. I was talking to somebody about old Macs and, and he said, he said, I have
[14:59.840 --> 15:03.360]  a Scuzzy drive and I can't connect it to anything. So I'm going to send it to you. And I'm like,
[15:03.360 --> 15:08.080]  okay. And he said, you can check it out. Just tell me if there's anything on it. And it has sat for,
[15:08.080 --> 15:13.520]  I don't know, a decade at least. And I, I finally, last week, as I was doing all this kind of moving
[15:13.520 --> 15:20.880]  old Macs around, I attached it to a G4. And it was empty. It had like a, just a folder that said,
[15:20.880 --> 15:26.800]  obviously he had erased it. So I was like, well, whoever you are, don't worry about it. There's
[15:26.800 --> 15:33.040]  nothing on those disks, but, but let me tell you the sense memory of plugging in a Scuzzy drive and
[15:33.040 --> 15:39.360]  a Terminator block on the back of a, of a hard drive. It took me back to the bad, bad, bad old
[15:39.360 --> 15:46.960]  days in the nineties. I always, I think Glenn has been on my show and is the most, cause he's a,
[15:46.960 --> 15:52.640]  Glenn's a jolly person, Glenn Fleischmann. Yes, he is. But he, boy, he really, he, if you want
[15:52.640 --> 15:58.480]  to make him angry, start talking about Scuzzy. And I think because he, he ran, you know, he did
[15:58.480 --> 16:04.560]  so much print work that he would encounter more machines, you know, like at my student newspaper
[16:04.560 --> 16:08.960]  at Drexel, we, we, you know, we'd get the machines working and we had, we didn't even have Scuzzy
[16:08.960 --> 16:13.280]  drives on most of them. You know, we'd just buy new machines with big enough internal drives and
[16:13.280 --> 16:17.200]  get machines working and they'd stay working. But if you work in like a print shop, you know,
[16:17.200 --> 16:22.240]  you, you wind up seeing a lot more stuff come and come and go. And boy, that was, it was,
[16:22.240 --> 16:27.920]  it was bad, but here we are emulating it with, with powerful computers, way more powerful.
[16:28.800 --> 16:34.400]  At some point when the iMac, some iMac anniversary was coming up and I looked back at our old Mac
[16:34.400 --> 16:38.480]  world coverage of when the iMac came out. And the thing that really blew me away was the article we
[16:38.480 --> 16:47.120]  did about, about USB. And so much of it was how USB is better than Scuzzy. And I looked at that
[16:47.120 --> 16:52.880]  and I was like, Oh no, I had, I'd forgotten. Like you can't plug it in. You got to turn off your
[16:52.880 --> 16:57.680]  computer. If you move anything around and it's got to have, they have IDs and you have to have
[16:57.680 --> 17:04.000]  termination. And it was just, it was so bad, but it was the, you had to do it because that's the
[17:04.000 --> 17:09.840]  only fast way to plug something into a Mac back before USB happened. You, you, you kind of can't
[17:09.840 --> 17:15.920]  believe it was the way it worked. Even on the Mac that things were so external storage was so
[17:15.920 --> 17:20.960]  difficult. And if you did anything wrong, you would turn on your Mac and it would just give you
[17:20.960 --> 17:24.800]  the question mark. And it'd be like, I have no idea what you did to that Scuzzy chain, but it's
[17:24.800 --> 17:29.440]  a disaster and I'm not going to deal with it. And you'd be like, what do I do? And then you'd have
[17:29.440 --> 17:34.400]  to like start unplugging, turn it back off and start unplugging and replugging and rebooting and
[17:34.400 --> 17:39.680]  shutting down and rebooting to hope that it would finally work. It was bad. Like Scuzzy, there are
[17:39.680 --> 17:45.280]  products called Scuzzy Voodoo and that's because people called it Scuzzy Voodoo. The idea that
[17:45.280 --> 17:50.320]  you like, literally, you're just guessing because it could be anything. Well, you'd have two
[17:50.320 --> 17:54.560]  machines side by side and you'd think that they're set up the same way and the one worked perfectly
[17:54.560 --> 17:58.800]  and the other one would boot up with the question mark and you'd be like, I don't get it. I don't
[17:58.800 --> 18:04.000]  even know what's happening. And they're like, did you check the dip switches? And people, like,
[18:04.000 --> 18:07.760]  as soon as you started talking to your colleagues about dip switches, you knew it was going to,
[18:07.760 --> 18:11.840]  curse words were coming next because people would get angry. But the other thing too, I remember
[18:11.840 --> 18:17.600]  from the era was somebody, there'd always be somebody who would be like, you don't need to
[18:17.600 --> 18:22.640]  turn it off. And, and they would have, you know, like they would just plug in their external drive
[18:22.640 --> 18:26.800]  with the Mac on and it would just work. And it's like, I wouldn't do that. And they'd be like, I've
[18:26.800 --> 18:32.640]  been doing it for, you know, months. And then the drive goes belly up and it's like, yep, told you.
[18:33.920 --> 18:37.840]  Cause it would, you know, have you seen Molt's, have you seen Molt's t-shirt that he sells?
[18:37.840 --> 18:42.480]  John Molt's has a t-shirt with the Terminator logo on it, but it's a picture of a Scuzzy Terminator.
[18:43.600 --> 18:47.040]  Very, very particular audience for that shirt, but it makes me laugh.
[18:48.560 --> 18:53.200]  All right. I'll add it to the show notes. Frigging Molt's sells some, sells some t-shirts.
[18:55.840 --> 18:59.040]  It's two great things from the nineties, Scuzzy and the Terminator.
[18:59.040 --> 19:02.880]  All right. Let me take a break and tell you about something from the 2020s. It's our good friends

[21:04.320 --> 21:12.880]  My thanks to Squarespace. All right. The report card came out and I love this. I love to talk to
[21:12.880 --> 21:18.080]  you about it. And I think I say the same thing every year, which is starting with just thank you.
[21:18.080 --> 21:23.600]  I thank you for organizing this. If you didn't do it, I don't know who else would, I don't know
[21:23.600 --> 21:32.160]  who's better placed in our little community to, to, uh, to ask the people who you ask and every,
[21:32.160 --> 21:35.920]  you know, it's not like the same people you've been slowly, I think steadily increasing the
[21:35.920 --> 21:42.880]  number of people you poll, which increases your work. Um, right. I invite more people, but we're
[21:42.880 --> 21:47.440]  down a little bit in total voters, I think this year, but I, I, I am actually resolved for next
[21:47.440 --> 21:51.280]  year to be a little more systematic about inviting new people. And my mailing list
[21:52.240 --> 21:56.880]  discipline has been very poor, but, um, I'm hoping to get better at that. Cause I'd like,
[21:56.880 --> 22:01.200]  I definitely would like to make, uh, you know, I, I miss people. There are people I invite and
[22:01.200 --> 22:04.160]  then I forget to invite again and stuff. And I don't want to, I don't want to do that,
[22:04.160 --> 22:09.200]  but the designer suggested the first two months I was doing six colors. He said,
[22:09.200 --> 22:12.720]  I had this idea and I don't know who would do it. Would you do it? And I was like, well,
[22:12.720 --> 22:16.960]  that sounds like a lot of work, but all right, I'll do it. And so credit to him for coming up
[22:16.960 --> 22:22.560]  with your initial idea. Um, and yeah, it's fun. It's also kind of fun because there's all these,
[22:22.560 --> 22:26.880]  you know, interesting opinions that everybody has about Apple. And yet at the same time,
[22:26.880 --> 22:32.240]  I liked, I get to kind of hover above this one and just be like the curator of it. And I think that's
[22:32.240 --> 22:36.080]  that's kind of fun. Cause I, I write opinion pieces about Apple all the time, but it's,
[22:36.080 --> 22:39.760]  it's fun for once to sort of like, literally, it's just like, well, what are they going to
[22:39.760 --> 22:43.920]  say this year? I have no idea how people are feeling. And that's, I think the value of the
[22:43.920 --> 22:48.080]  whole survey is more like, I don't think I'm proving anything so much as I'm taking the
[22:48.080 --> 22:53.040]  temperature of the room. I'm trying to say like, how do people feel this year? And I occasionally
[22:53.040 --> 22:57.520]  will get email from people who are like, I wish you would let it be an open poll. I wish you would
[22:57.520 --> 23:03.600]  let, you know, six colors members vote, all these sorts of things. The truth is I let my readers
[23:03.600 --> 23:11.600]  vote the first year and their results were almost identical to the panel. And so I haven't bothered
[23:11.600 --> 23:15.760]  going back yet because I just, I'm not sure it would make much difference. I think that there is
[23:15.760 --> 23:19.440]  a, I think there is a vibe and I think this captures it and that that's what it's really
[23:19.440 --> 23:22.560]  all about is sort of like, who's, what are we grumpy about this year? What are we happy
[23:22.560 --> 23:27.840]  about this year? How has that changed in the last now like seven years? Cause I've got all that data.
[23:27.840 --> 23:34.240]  It's always interesting to me where I personally agree with the consensus and usually like,
[23:34.240 --> 23:39.520]  for example, the Mac, let's just say had a great year last year and a great year this year.
[23:40.080 --> 23:46.640]  And duh, it's very obvious why, because the M1 Apple Silicon Mac started shipping at the
[23:46.640 --> 23:54.160]  end of 2020 and they had a great 2021 with some new Macs and no surprise that they got high scores.
[23:56.560 --> 24:01.040]  And it also always surprises me though, where I sort of disagree with the consensus or where
[24:01.040 --> 24:05.360]  the consensus there, you know, there's some areas where there doesn't seem to be a consensus. We'll
[24:05.360 --> 24:11.120]  get to it. I feel like we can just go by category by category. I also feel it warms my heart that
[24:11.120 --> 24:17.760]  you put the Mac first. I do feel, I feel you say you hover above it all, but I do feel like that's
[24:17.760 --> 24:27.840]  a, it's a slight Snellian bit of editorial. Yeah. Kay this year. Yeah. I mean, Mac Mac is first in
[24:27.840 --> 24:33.680]  the survey and first in my heart. And I decided to put it first this year, Kieran Healy aforementioned
[24:33.680 --> 24:38.320]  suggested that I actually sort my charts from from best to worst, which I think it was a good
[24:38.320 --> 24:42.400]  little sort of at a glance, you can see sort of like what did best and what did worst,
[24:42.400 --> 24:48.480]  but in the sections, they are in my order that I have always had them in and the Mac comes first
[24:48.480 --> 24:55.840]  in that. And yeah, that's my little statement. And I will say for people who read it and wonder
[24:55.840 --> 25:02.640]  if there's a relevance to the order in which people are quoted in the sections. I actually
[25:02.640 --> 25:08.480]  use BBEdit's randomize lines feature to randomize all of those. So you're not getting them like in
[25:08.480 --> 25:13.120]  the order in which they were entered or something. Or alphabetical or something like that.
[25:13.120 --> 25:17.760]  Exactly. And then sometimes I will move blocks of them that are related around,
[25:17.760 --> 25:21.680]  but that mostly didn't happen this time. There are a couple of sections where I felt like
[25:21.680 --> 25:26.480]  there were sort of two kinds of answers. In the Mac section, for example, there's a lot of
[25:26.480 --> 25:31.200]  hooray Apple Silicon, and then there's the we're unhappy about the software. And I kind of sorted
[25:31.200 --> 25:35.840]  those together a little bit, but mostly I just keep that stuff random too, because I realized
[25:35.840 --> 25:39.360]  one year and you could go back and you could probably figure it out. I think the people are
[25:39.360 --> 25:44.240]  literally listed in the order in which they took the survey. That's not great. I should probably
[25:44.240 --> 25:48.080]  randomize that somehow. So I do that now. Why is Gruber last?
[25:50.640 --> 25:55.040]  Yeah, you did it again this year. You were literally the last person to submit, but it's
[25:55.040 --> 25:59.680]  all fine. And Syracuse is listed first. What's going on with that?
[25:59.680 --> 26:03.680]  Well, yeah, I don't know if he was first this time, but he's usually right at the top. Yeah,
[26:03.680 --> 26:08.080]  he does it. And then some people come in late because they write thousands of words about
[26:08.080 --> 26:11.440]  Glenn. Our friend Glenn Fleishman previously mentioned he was first this time.
[26:12.720 --> 26:17.760]  There we go. Well, the Mac was first. Well, also, I just want to say what the hell does
[26:17.760 --> 26:21.680]  Kieran Healy know about the presentation of statistical data? But I know, right.
[26:21.680 --> 26:27.200]  He's just a dilettante. He doesn't have any idea. It is interesting. So I guess that is an
[26:27.200 --> 26:33.600]  interesting way to look at it is the in order Mac got the highest scores hardware reliability
[26:33.600 --> 26:41.680]  right behind as in general hardware across Apple's entire hardware lineup, then iPhone,
[26:41.680 --> 26:49.040]  then wearables, then iPad. Watch being low is one where I disagree with the consensus,
[26:49.040 --> 26:55.760]  but we can keep going services tied with watch software quality lower, maybe sort of the trail
[26:55.760 --> 27:03.120]  end of the middle of the pack. Environmental and social issues, which is nebulous. And I get it
[27:03.120 --> 27:08.080]  that you want to keep going. And maybe it's good that it's nebulous because it changes. I think
[27:08.080 --> 27:13.760]  since 2015, I think since 2015, when you started this, what people think of with environmental
[27:13.760 --> 27:20.160]  social impact is very different. It's totally different. And that's sort of that question
[27:20.160 --> 27:25.600]  was meant to be as broad as possible because I figured, again, I was going to be able to
[27:25.600 --> 27:30.400]  detect sort of what people were thinking of, whether it was, I think it was like a lot of
[27:30.400 --> 27:34.800]  factory conditions in China at some, at some point, but in other times it's been their commitment to
[27:35.360 --> 27:41.280]  green power and, you know, like recycling their products and like it all just kind of that for
[27:41.280 --> 27:45.440]  me, that's the category of Apple likes to talk about how it's a company that is also making the
[27:45.440 --> 27:50.080]  world a better place. How do, how does everybody feel they're doing? And beyond that, I just kind
[27:50.080 --> 27:55.600]  of leave it to like, it means what you want it to mean. I think that, well, not to skip ahead, but I
[27:55.600 --> 28:05.280]  think this year reading the comments, it's clear that a lot of people lumped in Apple employee
[28:05.280 --> 28:13.040]  satisfaction, slash working conditions, slash controversy over work from home. And, you know,
[28:13.040 --> 28:20.080]  maybe even retail, which, you know, it's, you know, they're, they are Apple employees is what has it,
[28:20.080 --> 28:25.760]  is it a good time to be working retail anywhere? No, I mean, it's, it's sort of the, hopefully,
[28:26.720 --> 28:33.280]  hopefully the worst time we're ever going to see. And honestly, and maybe it speaks to,
[28:35.280 --> 28:40.320]  I seldom use this word, but in this way, but it speaks to my privilege that it really didn't
[28:40.320 --> 28:47.520]  occur to me to think about the controversies over Apple's employee relations as part of that
[28:47.520 --> 28:53.280]  category, but they don't fit anywhere else. Clearly, if, if as a report card voter, you would
[28:53.280 --> 28:59.040]  like to make your opinion known on those issues, that would be the category to do it. And I think
[28:59.040 --> 29:08.000]  that the relatively low score reflects that 3.2. Yeah. And again, it's a, it's like a,
[29:08.000 --> 29:12.000]  it is a Rorschach test. It is what, what you want it to be. It's like, it's sort of like how you,
[29:12.000 --> 29:16.400]  how are you feeling about Apple as a force for good in the world? Because that's not normally
[29:16.400 --> 29:22.480]  what you look at for your billion dollar companies. But, but Apple, I feel like makes it,
[29:22.480 --> 29:28.240]  it's fair to ask because Apple talks about it. And so really I'm just saying, what do you think?
[29:28.240 --> 29:35.280]  And, and I think if everybody, if the issues with employment and people working at Apple
[29:35.280 --> 29:40.720]  comes to the mind of enough people to affect the, that category, then I guess that says something.
[29:40.720 --> 29:46.000]  Yeah. It's, you know, it's, it's interesting to note. And then the bottom three, Apple TV,
[29:46.000 --> 29:52.960]  developer relations, and then last home kit, which overall is a ranking feels about right.
[29:52.960 --> 29:57.920]  You know, it's, it's, you know, unsurprisingly, it's, it feels like, Hey, the system works.
[29:57.920 --> 30:03.920]  That's a good, good panel. So starting with the Mac, A plus is the grade. This is true.
[30:03.920 --> 30:08.560]  A plus is the grade. This is, I always get confused by this. How, how to the letter grades
[30:08.560 --> 30:20.080]  map to the scores? I think I asked you this every year. I made it up. I like the idea of the report
[30:20.080 --> 30:27.920]  card being like a, like a report card and not just a number that says, Oh, it's, it's 4.6 out of five.
[30:27.920 --> 30:32.480]  And so I have a, I have a little, uh, in my number spreadsheet, I actually have a little calculation
[30:32.480 --> 30:39.040]  field that does it. And so, um, 4.6 to five is an, a plus 4.3 to 4.5 is an a four to 4.2 is an
[30:39.040 --> 30:46.640]  a minus for 3.8 to 3.9 is a B plus at, and so on. I've got like a little map of, of what they are.
[30:46.640 --> 30:52.480]  And I figured those out kind of over the first couple of years of the survey. And then since
[30:52.480 --> 30:57.760]  then, I've just sort of stuck with them and it's again, it's shorthand. I wanted to figure out like
[30:57.760 --> 31:02.960]  if you're in the, at least the American school system, like you know what an a is and a B and a
[31:02.960 --> 31:08.560]  C. And when you get that D plus you're like, Hmm, that's not so great. Home kit. It's not so good.
[31:08.560 --> 31:14.400]  Well, I love that you do it because I, and I've on and off over the years, it's one of my,
[31:14.960 --> 31:21.040]  I'll go to my grave with it as a bugaboo, which is that a five star rating system or a four star
[31:21.040 --> 31:27.040]  rating system, nobody agrees what the stars mean. Right. So almost that's what, that's what almost
[31:27.040 --> 31:32.160]  that's what almost every system does. You know, you, you use some sort of, you know, like music
[31:32.160 --> 31:38.000]  app or you use, you know, video playing app. It's like, well, rate this video. What do you think?
[31:38.000 --> 31:42.960]  And it's like, thumbs up, thumbs down. And I know YouTube went through a whole thing last year where
[31:42.960 --> 31:48.800]  they took out the number, the count, the public count of people who tap the thumbs down because
[31:48.800 --> 31:53.120]  of reasons. And I know it was controversial amongst YouTubers, but at least thumbs up,
[31:53.120 --> 32:01.200]  thumbs down, everybody sort of agrees liked, didn't like, and the zero to five star thing,
[32:01.200 --> 32:06.000]  or some, some places, some, some systems make you like the lowest score you can give something is
[32:06.000 --> 32:12.720]  one star. You can't even leave a zero star review. And what does it mean? Is four stars like a B or
[32:12.720 --> 32:21.680]  is it like an A and five stars is like a plus, you know, like I've always thought of with five stars
[32:21.680 --> 32:29.040]  that four is very good. It's, it's like all star, like for, to go back to sports, of course. And
[32:29.040 --> 32:35.600]  that five stars is hall of fame. And, but a lot of people already just talking four to five stars,
[32:35.600 --> 32:41.200]  very different. They think, no, no, A, B, C, D, E. Yeah. I have, I've had this conversation.
[32:42.160 --> 32:46.720]  Mike Hurley and I talked about this on our podcast upgrade this week that he was like, Jason,
[32:46.720 --> 32:50.640]  when will you give anything five? And it's like, well, I was brought up at Mac user and then at
[32:50.640 --> 32:55.360]  Mac world that a five out of five should be really rare. And it should be for something that is
[32:55.360 --> 33:01.360]  nothing is flawless, but something that is. That is extra special. And I have done that.
[33:01.360 --> 33:06.480]  If you look at my, you know, my letterboxed movie ratings, where it's a five star system or my
[33:06.480 --> 33:12.080]  Goodreads book reviews, where it's a five star system, I don't give a lot of fives because,
[33:12.880 --> 33:20.080]  but I do give threes and fours. And the five is special. It's just really special.
[33:20.080 --> 33:24.560]  The other thing you have to realize here too, from a statistical perspective is the it's a,
[33:24.560 --> 33:28.960]  it's an average of a bunch of people giving one to five ratings. So first off, there's no zero is
[33:28.960 --> 33:36.400]  only one. So one is the floor and a five is the ceiling. And if you've got a 50, 60 people, like,
[33:36.400 --> 33:40.160]  unless they all agree, nothing's going to get five, right? There's always going to be somebody,
[33:40.160 --> 33:44.400]  even in the best, even in this Mac category, you give something a five, other people give it a
[33:44.400 --> 33:52.000]  four, the average comes down. And so really, there is a ceiling. I consider 4.6, like, wow,
[33:52.000 --> 33:56.800]  I can't believe so many people gave it a five out of five for it to be that high up. So that's an
[33:56.800 --> 34:04.240]  A plus for in my book. So yeah, my system, I think 3.3, it becomes a C. It's a little bit different
[34:04.240 --> 34:09.600]  because right, there is no, there is no 1.0. Nobody's going to do a 1.0 average, right? That's
[34:09.600 --> 34:15.360]  impossible in a survey like this. Right now with 53 respondents or however it was, right?
[34:15.360 --> 34:20.160]  Yeah. And they're all over the place. So yeah, it's 53 people this year who answered the call.
[34:21.440 --> 34:26.880]  I'm not surprised that the Mac got an A plus. It is. And I think it's a combination of,
[34:26.880 --> 34:33.360]  by any objective measure, the Apple Silicon Macs are just excellent. I think that the only
[34:33.360 --> 34:38.880]  complaint you can reasonably have about them is that they haven't gotten to all of them yet,
[34:38.880 --> 34:46.880]  right? We're still waiting for the, possibly just for another month, the pro level Mac Mini,
[34:46.880 --> 34:53.680]  the big iMacs, and then probably not until the end of the year, the Mac Pros and whatever else.
[34:53.680 --> 35:00.160]  And they're, but the ones that are out, which cover at least 80% of people's needs. I mean,
[35:01.280 --> 35:06.640]  I think they're excellent. They really are. They've fixed the problems with the keyboards.
[35:06.640 --> 35:11.840]  The displays are great. It amused me that, I don't know if there were more that you cut out.
[35:11.840 --> 35:15.840]  I think as far as I could tell, I've only highlighted one person who commented about
[35:15.840 --> 35:20.800]  the notch on the MacBook Pros, Rob Griffiths. Yeah, there was only only Rob Griffiths,
[35:20.800 --> 35:25.040]  everybody's favorite curmudgeon, Rob Griffiths. And even that was in good humor.
[35:25.040 --> 35:30.880]  Yeah, he made a joke about it. It was fine. No, I think it's, you can't deny,
[35:31.920 --> 35:35.280]  and many of these, it's one of the fun things about having all these people who think about
[35:35.280 --> 35:39.200]  Apple and they're sitting down and they're thinking about it for the year, is seeing how
[35:39.200 --> 35:44.080]  many people were just saying, look, this is very impressive. I feel like the Mac is a priority at
[35:44.080 --> 35:52.080]  Apple again. And it came like organically, nobody sees anybody else's responses out. Like many
[35:52.080 --> 35:57.840]  people said, the Mac is a priority again. Apple is sitting on all cylinders with the Mac again,
[35:57.840 --> 36:03.280]  and they're very happy about it. All the negativity, I would say, is on the software
[36:03.280 --> 36:12.160]  side. It is frustration with things like shortcuts on the Mac being weird and not shipping broken,
[36:12.160 --> 36:17.920]  but not even calling it a beta, just saying, here it is. And I think an overall feeling,
[36:17.920 --> 36:21.840]  and I think Syracuse even mentioned this at one point, like overall feeling that there are a lot
[36:21.840 --> 36:26.640]  of bugs that seem to just go unaddressed and there are a lot of apps that seem to be untouched. And
[36:26.640 --> 36:31.760]  I absolutely agree with that. I think that the untold story of Apple right now
[36:31.760 --> 36:38.800]  is on sort of across all aspects is how good they are at hardware and how they're soft.
[36:38.800 --> 36:45.840]  It's covering up a lot, but not all of the issues it's got maintaining its software that it's,
[36:46.400 --> 36:52.400]  and it's not just bugs, but it's bugs that don't get fixed for years. And it's also apps that just
[36:53.040 --> 36:58.720]  feel like they have dust gathering on them and a company of Apple size. I feel like they,
[36:58.720 --> 37:02.320]  it is incumbent upon them. Like if they're going to build an app, it's going to scare all the
[37:02.320 --> 37:06.560]  other apps out of the platform, probably at least to a certain degree, they have a responsibility
[37:06.560 --> 37:11.200]  to have that app be good, or it should not be there. And they don't seem to want to invest
[37:11.840 --> 37:16.800]  the resources so that every single one of their apps is a team that is cranking on it every year
[37:16.800 --> 37:22.720]  that is doing big updates for that app every year. Instead, some apps just kind of don't
[37:22.720 --> 37:30.400]  change for a long time and it's not great. Like it's, and it pales in comparison to the hardware,
[37:30.400 --> 37:36.080]  which is such a great story. So it is, and it's a long-term trend and I agree with it. And it's
[37:36.080 --> 37:42.640]  different than talking about software quality overall. It's more about like having just a
[37:42.640 --> 37:49.680]  certain standard and shortcuts. I don't, I, it shortcuts. I made a special note of it. I don't
[37:49.680 --> 37:55.200]  know whether to be happy or sad about this shortcut situation for Mac, because in one sense,
[37:55.200 --> 38:02.480]  the whole idea is great because the Mac automation story has been languishing for so long. And you
[38:02.480 --> 38:06.720]  and I talk about it all the time because it's right square in the middle of our personal
[38:06.720 --> 38:15.920]  interests. But AppleScript is one of literally, again, we were just joking about SCSI. AppleScript
[38:15.920 --> 38:22.160]  is software that started when SCSI was still a thing we used. Like that's how old of a technology
[38:22.160 --> 38:29.040]  AppleScript is. And it's a system seven technology. I don't think, I think it was system seven one.
[38:29.040 --> 38:33.600]  I don't think it shipped. I think it was, I think it was like, I think it was the early 90s version
[38:33.600 --> 38:39.200]  of something that was supposed to ship sooner and got punted, but seven pro, but, you know,
[38:39.200 --> 38:45.600]  think back like, Oh man, just pick a year. Like when the first IMAX came out and it's like, okay,
[38:45.600 --> 38:49.760]  they've announced this plan to reunify with next. They're going to build a next generation
[38:49.760 --> 38:53.920]  operating system. They've, you know, the management is actually, you know,
[38:54.560 --> 39:00.560]  Steve jobs might've still been the ICEO, but it seemed like solid competent management was in
[39:00.560 --> 39:05.600]  place. You know, the ship was righted. Let's hope that they, you know, righted it in time was the
[39:05.600 --> 39:10.880]  general sense of Apple and the Mac at the time you never in a million years would have guessed that
[39:10.880 --> 39:16.960]  25 years later, Apple script was still in, in the system. No, it just wasn't never, it was never
[39:16.960 --> 39:22.400]  that popular by which I mean, it was popular enough that it's there and it became entrenched
[39:22.400 --> 39:27.680]  in people's professional workflows, which is why it made all these various transitions.
[39:30.080 --> 39:37.360]  People only loved it and continue to enjoy it for what it allows them to do. Not the way that
[39:37.360 --> 39:43.360]  it does it. And it's just really kind of, you know, and everybody knows it's, you know, Apple's
[39:43.360 --> 39:48.400]  interest hasn't been in it as much as it could be, even though there have been some apps, like,
[39:48.400 --> 39:53.360]  for example, one of the thing that I still, I think it was a year ago, cause I think it was
[39:53.360 --> 40:02.720]  Big Sur when they did Mac messages as a catalyst app, but you know, sort of cheated by using
[40:02.720 --> 40:08.640]  certain eight private APIs that public catalyst apps can't, but still the canonical proof that
[40:09.760 --> 40:17.200]  an app with a shared code base with its iOS brethren using catalyst could be a first class
[40:17.200 --> 40:22.480]  Mac citizen. I really did not think that messages Apple script dictionary was going to make that.
[40:22.480 --> 40:26.480]  I was like, Hey, this app looks good. And they've, you know, it doesn't look squirrely in the way
[40:26.480 --> 40:33.040]  some of these catalyst apps like the Mac home app look right. It, this looks like the Mac messages
[40:33.040 --> 40:37.120]  app. It's actually, this seems, you know, more, this seems like a great idea. They've, they've
[40:37.120 --> 40:41.840]  pulled it off. It's an engineering success story, but come on, they're not going to, Apple script's
[40:41.840 --> 40:46.480]  not going to make it. Guess what? The full messages Apple script dictionary that dates
[40:46.480 --> 40:52.240]  back to when it was iChat, which is actually a very good Apple script dictionary made it.
[40:52.240 --> 40:56.880]  It's still there. So it's not like Apple's forgotten Apple script, but you know, it's not
[40:56.880 --> 41:01.120]  the future, right? It doesn't feel like it. It's certainly not going to iOS. Right. And it was
[41:01.120 --> 41:06.480]  really a drag when there was no idea what the future was. And that's, that's why shortcuts
[41:06.480 --> 41:12.720]  being on the Mac is a net good for the platform. And it's tricky. And I sensed in the panel,
[41:12.720 --> 41:17.520]  people trying to wrestle with this, which is the idea that you can be happy that shortcuts shipped
[41:17.520 --> 41:24.240]  on the Mac and unhappy with the details. And that's where we are. Our colleague, Dr. Drang,
[41:24.240 --> 41:30.800]  who writes about automation all the time, he just updated over the weekend to Monterey. And he was
[41:30.800 --> 41:37.040]  like, I know you guys said that it wasn't good, but I had no idea it was, you know, cause he's
[41:37.040 --> 41:41.680]  seeing it with fresh eyes for the first time, shortcuts on the Mac. And he's like, this is
[41:41.680 --> 41:45.600]  better than when they shipped it the first time. I'm like, yeah, it actually is. They've, they've
[41:45.600 --> 41:52.080]  fixed a bunch of stuff, but it is it's rough. And I'm so glad it's there and I use it now every day.
[41:52.080 --> 41:59.840]  I'm using shortcuts on the Mac. I'm so glad it's there, but it, I'm worried about the fact that
[41:59.840 --> 42:04.800]  they got to the point where they shipped it the way they did. And my understanding is they kind
[42:04.800 --> 42:13.200]  of had to make some decisions internally to get more people involved to fix what was wrong with
[42:13.200 --> 42:18.080]  it on the Mac because they knew it was kind of broken. And like, how does that happen?
[42:18.960 --> 42:23.120]  Like, I don't know. It's just, it comes back to that, that like, I feel like Apple
[42:24.160 --> 42:27.680]  is killing it so much on hardware. And then you look at the software and you're like, yeah,
[42:27.680 --> 42:32.960]  not really killing it. Like it's not terrible. There was an era back in the nineties, like we
[42:32.960 --> 42:40.080]  were talking about earlier where my Mac froze and had to be rebooted, hard rebooted four or
[42:40.080 --> 42:45.760]  five times a day. Like I'm so happy those days are beyond, you know, behind us and OS X. I use
[42:45.760 --> 42:52.640]  it all day without complaint and it's, it's fine, but there are things that give me pause in Apple's
[42:52.640 --> 42:58.560]  stewardship of not just the platform, but like it's apps that it has taken the responsibility
[42:58.560 --> 43:04.720]  to build into the platform. Yeah. To name one, just very specific example, there's, it's a thing
[43:04.720 --> 43:10.960]  if people writing little scripts or automator actions or now shortcuts, any kind of automation
[43:10.960 --> 43:17.200]  might want to do is you want to report the results of the little thing you're making for yourself.
[43:17.200 --> 43:22.320]  And, you know, obviously, obviously like on the command line, like if you're just writing
[43:22.320 --> 43:26.560]  a shell script or a Pearl script or a Python script, and it's just going to be something
[43:26.560 --> 43:31.440]  you run in the terminal, you just print whatever it is at the end, you run your script and then
[43:31.440 --> 43:36.080]  it prints to the terminal and it's, couldn't be easier. It's, you know, it's literally how
[43:36.080 --> 43:40.320]  computers worked when, when you and I were little kids, you know, you just print statements, you
[43:40.320 --> 43:45.520]  print stuff and then it shows up. Well, what do you do in a, in a graphical environment? Well,
[43:45.520 --> 43:52.480]  you display like a dialogue, right? And Apple script has had this weird thing where with the
[43:52.480 --> 44:00.160]  Big Sur redesign, the display alert command looks modern and display dialogue looks a little bit
[44:00.160 --> 44:07.360]  more old fashioned, but because Big Sur went to these, I mean, this has been true for 10 years
[44:07.360 --> 44:12.240]  where display alert looked more modern than display dialogue, even though they kind of do
[44:12.240 --> 44:16.880]  the same thing. They're just different amounts of contents in the alert, you know, the alert,
[44:17.440 --> 44:26.080]  but with Big Sur, they switched to where display alert looks iOS style. It's, it's the easiest
[44:26.080 --> 44:30.400]  thing I can say. It looks like an iOS dialogue and, and you don't have to be a scripter to know
[44:30.400 --> 44:34.560]  this. Like you, you can see it like when you try to close an unsaved document. Now it's,
[44:34.560 --> 44:42.000]  you get this dialogue box that is vertical rather than horizontal, even though Macs all have
[44:42.000 --> 44:49.200]  horizontal screens. And the reason iOS alerts are vertical is because phones have vertical screens,
[44:49.200 --> 44:54.480]  but it, it, there's this weird split in Apple script where you have these two commands that
[44:54.480 --> 44:58.960]  do something very similar. They used to look kind of the same. Now they look very, very different.
[44:59.760 --> 45:03.840]  And you can argue which one looks better, but shortcuts was like, well, hold my beer
[45:04.720 --> 45:09.840]  because I'm going to show you a way to show a dialogue that doesn't look right at all.
[45:10.480 --> 45:16.080]  It doesn't look old. It doesn't look new. It doesn't look from iOS. It just doesn't look
[45:16.080 --> 45:23.360]  like wrong, right? It doesn't look like old Mac. It doesn't look like Windows. It doesn't
[45:23.360 --> 45:28.560]  look like looking like iOS might've been understandable. And it would be like, well,
[45:28.560 --> 45:34.400]  now we have a third style of dialogue, you know, and the iOS look like, and I have a bunch of
[45:34.400 --> 45:42.640]  shortcuts that display dialogues with results and the ones on iOS. They make me feel very clever
[45:42.640 --> 45:47.280]  and like, Hey, this was just like a little shortcut. I whipped up in a couple of minutes.
[45:47.280 --> 45:52.000]  Well, you know, what I think is a couple of minutes, of course, was two hours of fine tuning
[45:52.000 --> 45:58.880]  and a wasted afternoon, but I've, I counted as a success. But when I run it and it looks like
[45:59.520 --> 46:08.960]  the type of cool looking modern iOS 15 alert that a real app might show, I feel like I'm, you know,
[46:08.960 --> 46:14.400]  making real software and this looks really cool. And then you do it on shortcuts on a Mac and it
[46:14.400 --> 46:20.480]  looks like, I don't know who thought this was right. And I think the answer is it was somebody
[46:20.480 --> 46:27.280]  who didn't really see the details and of what Mac stuff needed to look like. And it was,
[46:27.280 --> 46:32.880]  it really does feel like if you, you know, gave somebody no reference to what the Mac looks like,
[46:32.880 --> 46:37.360]  they could remember what the Mac looks like, but they had no reference and you asked them to make
[46:37.360 --> 46:42.880]  a dialogue box. They would come up with this. And I think that's basically what happened. And,
[46:42.880 --> 46:48.960]  you know, it's, I didn't even mention something that I only have discovered in the last week or so
[46:48.960 --> 46:54.800]  is also they would have like an okay or a default button in those dialogues. And if you press
[46:54.800 --> 46:59.920]  return, it doesn't do anything. And if you press command return, it didn't do anything,
[46:59.920 --> 47:04.240]  which is sort of the, okay, return you're entering text in a box. Okay. So you have to do command
[47:04.240 --> 47:14.480]  return. And I discovered last week that it was wired to function return, which is not a Mac
[47:14.480 --> 47:20.640]  thing at all. My understanding is that in, I can actually confirm it in the betas of 12.3,
[47:20.640 --> 47:24.960]  it actually is command return. So it follows the Mac spec. But again, it's one of those things of
[47:24.960 --> 47:29.760]  like, who, who thought of that? And it's like, they remember like, I know there needs to be a
[47:29.760 --> 47:36.320]  keyboard shortcut, right? But I, I'm not allowed to look and see what it is. So how about function
[47:36.320 --> 47:41.600]  return or globe return? Let's do that. Like that, surely that will be the answer. And it's like,
[47:41.600 --> 47:45.040]  no, there's a standard, it's command return. You should have just done that, but they did it. They
[47:45.040 --> 47:51.440]  fixed it again. Shortcuts has actually had, I don't know if you've noticed this, a much faster
[47:51.440 --> 47:57.760]  trajectory of getting better in interim Mac OS updates than any app I've seen in years in Mac
[47:57.760 --> 48:03.440]  OS. Like they are working, they are clearly really aware that it wasn't good enough and they're
[48:03.440 --> 48:07.040]  making progress, which is great. Cause the alternative is what we wait a year for it to
[48:07.040 --> 48:12.240]  get better. Right now. So I think it's, I, so I lean on the side of, should we be depressed
[48:12.240 --> 48:17.680]  because it's so glaringly obvious that it has problems or should we be happy that it exists
[48:17.680 --> 48:22.800]  at all and that they're moving it's that, and that they're clearly moving fast and we don't even have
[48:22.800 --> 48:27.440]  to worry about waiting until WWDC. You could see that they're, that they meant it and it wasn't
[48:27.440 --> 48:35.440]  just like, Oh God, Federighi decided to announce shortcuts in the keynote. I thought we've decided
[48:35.440 --> 48:38.720]  not to, you know, and that the company was like, we weren't even going to do Mac shortcuts. Now
[48:38.720 --> 48:44.320]  we're stuck doing it. It made it into the keynote. It's like, there's clearly enthusiasm to make it
[48:44.320 --> 48:50.160]  good and to get it up to par. I guess the thing that bothers me about it though is, and is a
[48:50.160 --> 48:56.960]  worrisome canary in the coal mine is that I think famously, even though Apple has published human
[48:56.960 --> 49:02.080]  interface guidelines from as long as I can remember, I mean, way back, they started
[49:02.080 --> 49:09.920]  publishing them. Many of the best UI designers and developers slash designers, you know,
[49:10.480 --> 49:15.760]  like a James Thompson type person who just, you know, works on their own and does their own
[49:15.760 --> 49:20.160]  design. I know so many people who'd be like, you know, I never, I've never read The Hig.
[49:20.160 --> 49:24.560]  And, you know, it's a lot like addiction. Sometimes it was a lot like a dictionary
[49:24.560 --> 49:30.800]  to a writer, what The Hig was to a UI designer where, okay, they have it. And if they really
[49:30.800 --> 49:36.080]  do get stuck, like, huh, that's a really good question. How do you show three-way state in a
[49:36.080 --> 49:41.840]  checkbox? Hmm. All right, I'll go look it up in The Hig and actually look something up. It's like
[49:41.840 --> 49:46.560]  looking up a word, you know, what's a, or a thesaurus, like what's a different word for this?
[49:47.200 --> 49:55.040]  But the one, and the reason was that people learned to become Mac UI designers by using the
[49:55.040 --> 50:02.160]  Mac. And that you just sort of pick it up. It's like the way that as a kid, you don't really have
[50:02.160 --> 50:07.520]  to be taught how to speak. You just, as a baby, you just grow up in the house and you just pick
[50:07.520 --> 50:11.600]  up the language from your parents. Or if it's a bilingual family, you pick up both languages.
[50:11.600 --> 50:16.480]  Like, it's just amazing. You just pick it up and you learn how to speak these languages. And
[50:17.760 --> 50:23.920]  you could often point to some apps from Apple and say, this is, this is a great app from Apple,
[50:23.920 --> 50:28.400]  or this, this part of the system software is great. This is, you should learn how they did
[50:28.400 --> 50:34.400]  think about how every single thing about this and how they did this user interface and copy that,
[50:34.400 --> 50:40.000]  or, or use it as the model for the thing you're making. And the worst case was usually, well,
[50:40.000 --> 50:44.560]  that's not the best work from Apple, but you wouldn't be wrong by following Apple's lead.
[50:44.560 --> 50:48.480]  Right. It was very rare where you would say, Oh, don't do what Apple did. And yeah,
[50:48.480 --> 50:54.160]  they're, they're setting part of being the platform owner is, is, is leading by example.
[50:55.440 --> 51:00.000]  And it just feels like there's more and more cases lately where it's like, huh, I don't know.
[51:00.000 --> 51:04.960]  It just doesn't seem like what Apple's doing is sort of the gold standard of the platform.
[51:06.480 --> 51:12.800]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's, I think that's it. And, and maybe those days have passed and I don't want
[51:12.800 --> 51:17.040]  to get too fussy. I think that oftentimes when we talk about, we invoke the Hague and things
[51:17.040 --> 51:20.560]  like that, people are like, yeah, you know, it's a little like invoking English grammar
[51:21.280 --> 51:28.000]  and spelling like things change things drift. I get it. I get it. Apple as is a leader in a
[51:28.000 --> 51:32.000]  way that like the English language has no leaders. It's more like that French group that says this
[51:32.000 --> 51:35.840]  is not a French word. You can't use it anymore. Apple could be doing that, or they could just
[51:35.840 --> 51:40.560]  sort of abandon it. And there is a platform transition going on, like with catalyst and
[51:40.560 --> 51:46.080]  Swift UI. I wonder sometimes I'm not trying to make excuses for them because nobody is
[51:46.080 --> 51:52.320]  more frustrated than me about how bad like. Apple mail is like, if you use Apple mail,
[51:52.320 --> 51:56.160]  that's great. I hate Apple mail. And I think that it hasn't really changed much in 15 or
[51:56.160 --> 52:01.680]  20 years and it's wildly inefficient. And every time I use it, I hate it more and I abandon it
[52:01.680 --> 52:06.960]  as quickly as I can. And I feel like if there was ever an app that needed to be reinvented by Apple
[52:07.600 --> 52:14.960]  for modern usage, it's something like Apple mail. But my point here is I would almost understand
[52:14.960 --> 52:19.040]  if one of the things that Apple really is doing is saying, Hey guys, we're trying not to make a
[52:19.040 --> 52:24.880]  lot of software changes at the moment because we're really dragging everything over into this
[52:24.880 --> 52:30.560]  new world with Swift UI where we can develop all these apps one time and deploy them on all our
[52:30.560 --> 52:36.000]  platforms. And so we really don't want to put a lot of effort into them in the meantime. And I get
[52:36.000 --> 52:41.280]  that, but at the same time, it's like, how many years are going to go by where your apps don't
[52:41.280 --> 52:47.760]  get updates and you roll out shortcuts and your own apps don't support it properly? And I can
[52:47.760 --> 52:53.520]  understand it to a certain extent because it is true. They are on the fly sort of rebuilding what
[52:53.520 --> 53:01.280]  it is to be an app across all Apple platforms, but I still need to use it today. It's sort of
[53:01.280 --> 53:08.320]  maybe like the software equivalent of trying to get from building Intel based Macs to Apple
[53:08.320 --> 53:15.200]  Silicon Macs. And they wound up with some really spotty years that made people question what the
[53:15.200 --> 53:19.280]  heck are you doing? But it's like, well, we're, we're trying to move everything to this new system
[53:19.280 --> 53:23.760]  and we don't want, you know, we don't want to there. I think it's a little bit more product
[53:23.760 --> 53:29.440]  marketing spite where they didn't want to necessarily put like this great new edge to
[53:29.440 --> 53:33.600]  edge display on the Intel, the last generation, you know, they probably could have done that with
[53:33.600 --> 53:39.120]  the last Intel MacBook Pros. And it's like, well, let's save these, this more impressive edge to
[53:39.120 --> 53:44.080]  edge display for when we have Apple Silicon. This, it, software is a little bit different
[53:44.080 --> 53:48.480]  because it's like when they make a new MacBook Pro, it really is a new MacBook Pro and software
[53:48.480 --> 53:56.160]  just sort of what accretes, you know, it, it, but it, it, in broad strokes, I feel like that's sort
[53:56.160 --> 54:00.400]  of where they are, you know, and I hopefully, right. That they're like, well, we don't want
[54:00.400 --> 54:06.160]  to redo mail now or something else now. Yeah. If I'm being optimistic, that's, that's, that's
[54:06.160 --> 54:10.240]  my hope is that, is that some of this stuff is on hold because they're really trying to prioritize
[54:10.240 --> 54:14.480]  moving the frameworks far enough along that they can be in a place where they can roll out new
[54:14.480 --> 54:20.000]  versions of their apps and it goes everywhere. But, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm feeling it in terms
[54:20.000 --> 54:24.080]  of the kind of maintenance of the existing platform. And, and, and I always say, I mean,
[54:24.080 --> 54:29.200]  this is back when I used to review loads of software for Mac world back in the day that
[54:29.200 --> 54:33.600]  just because you did a lot of work under the hood on this new version of your app,
[54:33.600 --> 54:38.800]  if your users can't see it, they don't care. Like they literally, they don't care because they're
[54:38.800 --> 54:42.880]  just there to do their job every day. And that's sort of how I feel about this. It's like, I
[54:42.880 --> 54:48.080]  understand there's a huge amount of effort going on beneath the surface in Apple's software group
[54:48.080 --> 54:53.360]  for things like Swift UI and moving all these apps over and adapting apps from iOS for the Mac.
[54:53.360 --> 54:58.240]  I get it. But at the end of the day, I can understand that. And still I'm a user sitting
[54:58.240 --> 55:03.920]  at my desk trying to use software. And if I don't see it, it doesn't matter.
[55:03.920 --> 55:09.440]  Yeah. I, I, uh, to, to tie up the Mac segment, I will say that, that, that brings to mind a
[55:09.440 --> 55:16.080]  point that I saw through the comments on the Mac in, in the report card, which is either implicit
[55:16.800 --> 55:23.040]  a lot of the time or explicit, uh, praise for the ease of the transition from Intel to Apple
[55:23.040 --> 55:31.600]  Silicon. Right. And this is where Apple is just been fantastic for so many years on, and we can
[55:31.600 --> 55:36.400]  get in developer relations later and how it relates to the app store. But in so many ways,
[55:36.400 --> 55:42.000]  every single app I use the last one, the last laggard was Dropbox to go native for Apple
[55:42.000 --> 55:49.840]  Silicon. But even there, I didn't really notice that it was an Intel thing. And it going back to
[55:49.840 --> 55:56.480]  the S the power PC to Intel was pretty smooth. Each of these they've it's, they have enough
[55:56.480 --> 56:01.760]  institutional memory. And a lot of times in, you know, you and I, you know, know some people who've
[56:01.760 --> 56:06.800]  been at Apple through all of these transitions, it's not just institutional memory. It's actually
[56:06.800 --> 56:11.840]  people who've been there. They're getting better at it. But this one was so seamless. I mean,
[56:11.840 --> 56:16.800]  like, I remember thinking that the Intel one, the power PC to Intel was so much smoother than
[56:16.800 --> 56:23.680]  68K to power PC. And, you know, and part of that is just the simple fact that in the 68K era was
[56:23.680 --> 56:29.920]  so long ago and computers were so slow that so much of it was written in like assembly language
[56:29.920 --> 56:36.320]  or the compiler literally was only a 68K compiler. And now you've got, even if you had written your
[56:36.320 --> 56:41.680]  app in C or Pascal, now you have to switch to a new compiler and the compiler says your,
[56:41.680 --> 56:45.920]  you know, your code doesn't, doesn't compile. Now you've got to fix all these bugs. And I just
[56:45.920 --> 56:51.440]  remember when, when 68K went to power PC, so many apps would have like a major release. It would be
[56:51.440 --> 56:56.800]  like from version two to version 3.0 and the only thing was power PC native. And it's like, well,
[56:56.800 --> 57:04.880]  that doesn't really, what about some new features, you know? Yeah, exactly. It's, it's, it's a
[57:04.880 --> 57:10.560]  remarkable transition and the speed of Apple Silicon making Rosetta to sort of not matter
[57:10.560 --> 57:15.520]  and that you don't notice. And I remember like, yeah, the power PC transition from 68K,
[57:15.520 --> 57:20.800]  you really could tell you were running a translated app. Like it was slower and Intel
[57:20.800 --> 57:26.240]  wasn't better. Like, but it was amazing that it worked, but it was slow. It was, it felt,
[57:26.800 --> 57:30.960]  fell down. Yeah. And the intro transition was better, but this one is, is seamless. And yes,
[57:30.960 --> 57:34.160]  I I don't know whether it was here or somewhere, but I made a comment about,
[57:34.160 --> 57:40.560]  I wrote a Mac world column. I think it was. And I talked about how Apple's really good at processor
[57:40.560 --> 57:44.880]  transitions and it's been through multiple Mac processor transitions. And I, and then I,
[57:44.880 --> 57:49.600]  I decided to throw in a line where I said, you know, granted, probably the people involved are
[57:49.600 --> 57:54.800]  not the same. And I actually got a message from somebody who was like, I actually worked on all
[57:54.800 --> 57:59.040]  of those. I'm like, Oh my God. Okay. I apologize. There are people, we don't think about it, but
[57:59.040 --> 58:03.200]  there are people that at Apple who have been there through all of this and have done this. And
[58:03.200 --> 58:09.360]  certainly institutionally Apple has gotten really good at it. And this transition in part, because
[58:09.360 --> 58:16.000]  the Apple Silicon stuff is so good, but also for some other reasons was flawless and, and it's so
[58:17.120 --> 58:23.200]  easy to adjust, accept it and say it's invisible and it doesn't matter. And it does deserve,
[58:23.200 --> 58:28.800]  and I'm glad the panelists said it, it does deserve essentially applause because it, it could,
[58:28.800 --> 58:35.120]  it could have been much harder, right? Going from Intel chips to Apple design chips that
[58:35.120 --> 58:40.000]  were really originally designed for phones and have it be like, is the Mac going to even make
[58:40.000 --> 58:44.880]  it? And the answer is the Mac didn't even just make it across, but it's like, they're way better
[58:44.880 --> 58:50.320]  off now. And they deserve credit. And so those high scores in the Mac, the last two years of
[58:50.320 --> 58:55.680]  the report card absolutely deserved like it. The Mac is, and for those of us who went through those
[58:55.680 --> 59:01.120]  doldrums where the laptops were kind of bad and they, they seem to not have a plan for the Mac,
[59:01.120 --> 59:07.920]  like what a turnaround it's taken like five years, but it is gone from being like an afterthought to
[59:07.920 --> 59:15.120]  being one of the shining. Jules in Apple's crown now. Yeah, absolutely. And it's, and again,
[59:15.120 --> 59:18.480]  not just for enthusiasts, you know, like, Oh, people who understand the difference between
[59:18.480 --> 59:24.160]  Intel and Apple Silicon binaries, like just everybody, it just, and, and the Mac it's
[59:24.160 --> 59:29.360]  important because, and as much as the iPhone and even iPad have really grown the number of
[59:29.360 --> 59:36.000]  people who use Apple computers, just as talk phone and iPad and Mac, the Mac is bigger and
[59:36.000 --> 59:40.720]  more popular than ever. And an awful lot of, you know, probably a majority of people use it in a
[59:40.720 --> 59:48.960]  very consumery sort of way. And it's the best selling, whatever, six quarters or the six best
[59:48.960 --> 59:53.760]  Mac quarters ever. The last six quarters of Mac sales, the Mac is selling more on average
[59:53.760 --> 59:58.960]  in a, you know, rolling four quarter average than it literally ever has in its entire existence.
[59:58.960 --> 01:00:04.480]  It is, we are, you know, at the top, there has never been a better time in terms of Mac sales
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:10.160]  than right now. So it's not just us, right? It's everybody who is buying and using a Mac out there.
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:15.600]  And it really is a thankless job. I mean, and so I, you know, if we can, if we can make it
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:21.520]  ever so slightly, what's the opposite of thankless, thankful, a thankful job. Thank you. Thank you
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:29.760]  engineers on Rosetta too, for making a wonderful technology that is going to be transitioned away
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:35.840]  from as soon as Apple feels like it can, which is like so thankless. I was just saying that software
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:40.480]  stays forever and it accretes, but it's like the Rosetta layers tend to disappear after a couple
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:46.480]  of years and it'll happen. And that's how, you know, you did a good job and what a weird position
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:51.680]  to be in, you know, here's this thing. I made this amazing technology nobody noticed and nobody
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:01:01.200]  notices. All right, let me thank our next sponsor. It is a new sponsor remote. Do you employ or pay
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:07.280]  workers in other countries? Even if you don't yet, you might soon with remote work. Now that remote
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:12.400]  work is the norm, employees have more freedom than ever to move around, not just around the country,
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:16.000]  but around the world. If you want to keep your best people, you have to stay flexible. That's
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:22.080]  why remote makes it easy for companies of all sizes to employ global teams. They take care
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:28.800]  of international payroll, benefits, taxes, local compliance, so you can focus less on paperwork
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:34.320]  and more on growing your business by just finding the best employees and keeping them happy wherever
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:38.480]  they are. They help you onboard full-time employees or contractors in countries all over
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:44.320]  the world in minutes. And it's just a simple, easy to use platform and they let you rest easy

[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:12.000]  which the upstart product, a little upstart program, a little bit more up and down from
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.480]  year to year than you would think. It's, you know, and I know that the scores are, are they,
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:25.280]  is the up and down, uh, regulated between, yeah, it looks like it is. I think, I think it's a,
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:29.360]  a literally people get excited when there's new stuff. It's just like the sales figures.
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:33.760]  I think people get excited when there's a new looking phone and get a little bit bored
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:39.280]  when it's the same and you see it in sales and you see it on the iPhone, the iPhone goes
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:43.760]  kind of up and down and up and down and up and down. And so last year it was up because
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:49.600]  the iPhone 12 was new and the iPhone 13 didn't look any different. And I, part of me thinks,
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:53.280]  of course it doesn't, they don't do a new look every year, but I think people want to give Apple
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:58.240]  credit when they do a new look and when they don't, they don't want to, so they don't.
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:04.160]  So I, and I, you know, I, I I'll skip ahead. I'll say I had the same feeling about the watch
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:08.560]  and I feel like people say with the series seven, like, ah, it's, you know, it's okay.
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:13.280]  The screen's bigger, but it's like, well, it's like, I disagree about that one too.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:17.920]  Like I bought a series seven and I think it's so much better than my series five was. So I'm very
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:24.160]  happy with it. And I'm like, yeah, I, and I wonder, I wonder though, too, how much of it,
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:29.600]  and I even mentioned in my comment that you quoted that I didn't expect to buy a series seven,
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:34.400]  but then after reviewing a series seven, I was like, oh, I gotta, I can't go back. I really need
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:42.640]  this. But I feel like some of it, if you don't see it and people are less likely, I mean, I know
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:47.600]  COVID restrictions are easing and stores are open, but I still think people pop into their local
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:51.680]  Apple store. Even if you have a local Apple store, let's say you live close enough where there's my
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:57.920]  nearby Apple store. It's, you know, common sense. You know, people are just going out less, right?
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:04.000]  It's, you know, in a little bit less likely to see it in person. And maybe because the overall,
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:10.800]  like the difference between like series five, series six and a series seven, to me, it seems
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:14.800]  like something you wouldn't really notice on somebody at another table in a restaurant.
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:19.200]  You're right. It's, they're close enough where you kind of have to get close to see how much
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:24.080]  bigger the screen is. You know, like you could tell it's not the old series three watch, but
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:28.640]  I don't know which one it is. It doesn't jump out at you. And I feel like, you know, obviously,
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:34.640]  iPhone 13 has that factor with the iPhone 12. I mean, it's, you know, the camera's improved.
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:42.240]  Battery life is a big improvement. That was my comment that you included that the factoid that
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:49.440]  the 13 mini gets longer battery life by everybody's tests that I saw. And I saw a
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:55.360]  bunch of reviews that pitted them against each other. Then the full size mid-size iPhone 12 from
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:06:01.520]  last year. That's amazing. And that to me, battery life and camera improvements. I think that was
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:06.160]  Nick here's comment too, that if they just keep doing battery life and camera improvements year
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:12.720]  over year for a while, that's fine with me because those are the two things that are most, affect
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:17.440]  the most people in the biggest ways. Yeah, it's true. And I, as somebody who went from a 12 mini
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:23.360]  to a 13 mini, you can tell. Oh my gosh. Battery life is so much better. That, that to me would be
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:29.040]  like a multi, you know, like, you know, like a normal non-enthusiast who buys a new phone every
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:33.840]  four years because the mini it was, Oh, it was such a nice size. And the 12 mini was like, well,
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:41.120]  I'm glad I'm locked in for the year because I need to plug in my phone again. The 13 mini gets
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:45.360]  much better battery life. And I think a couple people commented in their comments on the report
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:50.320]  card, like 13 mini is really nice. It'd be a shame if it's true that they're not going to keep making
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:55.760]  these mini size phones as the rumors suggest. I know I can't, can't vote them down for that
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:06.240]  this year, but I can be disappointed next year. One star, no mini, one star. Boo. I've highlighted,
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:12.880]  I've highlighted a comment from James Thompson, which gets to a point I made earlier about Apple
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:19.360]  and internal employees as with the Mac, this is James Thompson, Drag Thing and, Peacock. Well,
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:25.120]  Drag Thing, of course, Drag Thing is of course, I've got classic Mac on my mind. Peacock.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:31.680]  I'll be running that on an SD card later. Drag Thing. The Dice app. What's this Dice app called?
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:37.920]  Just Dice by Peacock, right? Dice by Peacock, yeah. Branding. As with the Mac, a similar pattern
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:43.280]  of solid hardware paired with remarkably unexciting software updates, but software development seems
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:48.560]  to be one part of Apple that the pandemic has really hit hard in the past year. This,
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:55.920]  I don't know if it's true or not. I don't know. Maybe? Is there, this is to me an open question
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:03.280]  and somewhere else in the report card, probably in the societal environmental area, Glenn was adamant
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:10.160]  about, hey, espousing a view that I've heard from many people that, hey, the last two years that
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:15.040]  almost everybody working on Apple software has been working from home and they're still doing
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:22.240]  great. So what is, why is the company insisting on so many such, going back to normal, which for
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:30.240]  Apple meant working in the office in Cupertino or wherever you were? I think it's an open question,
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:37.600]  whether it's affected their software. I've spoken to some people. I know people, I know a lot of
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:43.920]  people who work at Apple and I know some people who, when I've made comments about it on Daring
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:49.840]  Fireball have not been mad at me because we're friends, but disagree and say, no, I feel more
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:55.760]  productive at work. I'm not getting interrupted. I'm doing more better work, working from home
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:01.440]  all day, every day than I was before. And I've spoken to other people who've said, it's a
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:08.720]  nightmare that our meetings are a mess. And Apple, the meetings thing is interesting. And I know some
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:14.480]  people just hate meetings. I know people who work at Apple who hate meetings, but Apple has a very,
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:18.080]  my understanding as someone who's never worked there, but knowing a lot of people who do,
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:25.600]  they take their meeting culture very seriously. And it's a company where time is valued and the
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:34.960]  canard, the trope of, oh my God, you work in a big corporation and you spend all day in meetings
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:40.320]  and it's a waste of time. And that Apple doesn't typically work like that. And I'm sure that they're
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:45.600]  so big now. I'm sure there's exceptions. It's all good teams and bad teams meeting wise, but
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:51.600]  if everybody has to meet over Zoom, everybody knows what Zoom meetings are like and it's
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:58.480]  possibly problematic. So that's why I highlighted James's comment that, I don't know, is there
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:03.760]  something that's, is there an overall, is hardware getting ahead of software because hardware has to
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:09.200]  be in person and hardware, like you just know, like there's certain aspects of hardware that
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:16.000]  are just like binary. Yes or no. Does this machine feel solid? Does the hinge feel good? Yes or no.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.480]  Is the keys durable? If we set up a robot to type 20 million words on this keyboard,
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:29.200]  do the keys still work? Software is a lot more on the liberal arts side of Steve Jobs's Boulevard,
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:37.120]  right? Where it's, it's, it's hard to say, right? We don't know. The thing is, we don't know what
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:41.120]  they wanted to do this last couple of years, right? Like we don't, we can't see what they
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:45.680]  didn't do and what they didn't release. And I think what James, at least the way I read
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:51.280]  James's comment is it does feel like maybe they have taken their foot off the gas a little bit
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:59.920]  in terms of OS feature ambition on iOS and Mac in the last year or two. And that may be pandemic
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:06.240]  related or it may not be. Also, I think your anecdotes point to the truth of this, which is,
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:13.520]  I think it's different groups and different people work differently. And, and I, my hope
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:20.000]  is that over time, what shakes out at Apple is an understanding that there's some stuff and there
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  are also some people who need to be, it needs to be done with more of a, an in-person approach.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.160]  And there's other stuff that doesn't. And I think that the challenge is that Apple has a default
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:38.720]  culture of everybody needs to be here. And there are cases where everybody does need to be there.
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:44.160]  There are probably ones where everybody doesn't. And when you're in a very expensive place in the
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:49.840]  world you're going to probably have to deal with hiring people who are not going to move to
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:54.000]  Cupertino if you want the best people. And so they're going to have to, they're going to have
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:00.400]  to deal with this, but I also think that it's true that some people it's a nightmare. Like I
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:04.560]  have no doubt that some people work way worse in that scenario. It's a little like you and me,
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:11.440]  right? Like I would not recommend working for yourself in your own house to everyone.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:18.880]  Right? Like you, you have to be motivated and focused and have something wired in your brain
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:22.400]  or it's going to go really badly. It's not for everyone.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:26.640]  Yeah. And you know, and that's the criticism I've heard from people when I've chimed in on this is
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:30.320]  what the hell do you know? You work by yourself. And it's like, yeah, but you say that like, that's
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:35.280]  a, that's your dream. I there's an awful lot of people who would hate my workday. They, yeah,
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:40.480]  they may not, they might enjoy my commute, but there's some people who would go nuts,
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:44.480]  you know, without having colleagues to socialize with in person. I mean, it's,
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:52.160]  it is, it, it varies. And I do think, and I think about this, I have a piece I'm working
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:57.440]  on for Daring Fireball. I don't want to go into it because it's not a spoiler per se, but I made
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:03.840]  a comparison a couple of weeks ago to a story that came out that Facebook had scrapped an internal
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:10.080]  homegrown OS for their VR goggles in favor of just staying with what they already had,
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:17.680]  which was sort of their own fork of Android. And I had compared it to the, or the proto iPhones
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:23.280]  where there were two parallel tracks where there was sort of a, well, let's, let's do like a Linux
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:30.720]  embedded system. That's more like an iPod type thing. And let's grow up the iPod or let's shrink
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:38.160]  down the Mac. And my follow-up is basically that I think it was a bad comparison because this
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:43.760]  Facebook thing clearly was on parallel tracks for a very long time. And, you know, they had like,
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:47.760]  I think they said they were like 300 people working on this, the one that the version of
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:53.120]  the OS that got scrapped and a senior executive left and blah, blah, blah. The thing that
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.200]  revisiting the early days of the iPhone brings back to me is how shockingly fast
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:05.120]  Apple put it together. Right? That's, that's the thing is that talking to people from Apple,
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:11.120]  many of them who are actually still there, uh, kind sources, reliving some of that,
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:17.040]  they, they more or less built what we know is the iPhone, the first iPhone OS in 2006,
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:24.480]  like in one year, they, they built it. And yes, that there were parts that they inherit developer
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:30.160]  stuff and, and the similarities between UI kit and app kit and, and stuff they, they, you know,
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:35.600]  because they had some good bones in the OS and frameworks and patterns that they could follow.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:42.800]  But still, it's just, it was just a remarkable pace. And I do kind of feel like maybe I'm too
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:49.200]  forgiving at times as a critic slash pundit of, well, you don't have to upset the Apple
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:55.520]  card every single year and blow us away. Right. And maybe I'm, I, you know, there's maybe there's
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:03.920]  something right about having the pundit commentary class press Apple critically to do more wow year
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:11.360]  over year. That's where I was going. Yeah. I think, I think you're right in the sense too,
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:16.400]  that, um, we can internalize the idea that, well, you know, they're not going to do it every year
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:20.240]  and they're not going to do it every year for a lot of reasons, including just the cost and the
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:25.280]  amount of effort that goes into it. And as you have pointed out many times, iteration is kind
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:28.480]  of Apple's thing. And they really seem to like this model where they do the outside change,
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:32.880]  but then they've got a couple other years of iterative internal changes coming, and then they
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:38.320]  flip the outside change again. But the truth is it's hard to hold it against somebody to say,
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:42.320]  I'm disappointed that there wasn't a new thing this year, even if they understand it. Because
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:46.480]  if you look at sales, the sales bear it out generally too, that the years that they make
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:52.640]  the big outside change, the sales go up to people like it too. So I think I, although it may not
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:16:01.600]  be realistic to want it, I think it's also not unrealistic to be less excited about a year where
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:06.320]  there isn't as much obvious, uh, forward move movement, if that makes any sense.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:13.920]  Yeah. Uh, other iPhone stuff, the, uh, cinematic mode, a couple of people commented that it,
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:18.400]  you know, you know, it's a lot of promotion about it, but I don't use it. There's a quote from
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:24.160]  Benjamin Mayo, uh, cinematic mode was a bit of a letdown and currently sits in gimmick territory.
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:28.320]  But then, and I, as soon as he, I was like highlighting it with my Apple pencil and then
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:32.960]  his next sentence covers what I was going to say. It's easy to spot the fakeness like early years
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:38.400]  of portrait mode, still photography. Um, which is exactly what I was going to say. So hats off to
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:44.400]  Benjamin for making his own comment, which is, I, you know, I like the cinematic mode.
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:50.320]  Uh, I don't use it. I haven't used it a lot since, since finishing my reviews. But again,
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:55.360]  I'm not, I haven't gone that many places. Haven't been on vacation since last summer. So where
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:17:00.720]  would I shoot video? I kind of feel like, I think it's an interesting direction for video
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:07.600]  to go. It is definitely very analogous. It is to video what, uh, portrait mode is to still.
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:13.600]  And I think with portrait, you know, the first year of portrait looked really weird, you know,
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:19.600]  like really look, people looked best if they didn't have eyeglasses and had a bald head or
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:28.080]  a hat because hair, hair and eyeglasses did, didn't really make, make the, the bokeh border
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:32.800]  very well, but they've gotten a lot better at that. And I feel like they drew a good line for,
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:37.360]  this is the year we should ship this cinematic mode. It's, we're, it's, it's good enough to ship
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:43.120]  and we'll keep making it better. Obviously, Apple feels that regular people just think it's cool.
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:48.320]  And that it's the rest of us who have a little more discerning eye who can spot all of the things
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:53.520]  that are wrong with it. And I say that because Apple has made cinematic mode, the centerpiece
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:58.080]  of several ads. They have ads, they have the ads with the two guys in the car talking to each other,
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:05.600]  the two cops, and it is shot in cinematic mode. And I was talking to my wife about it and she's
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:13.040]  like, it looks fine, whatever. And I said, I think it looks terrible. I can see everything
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:18.400]  that's wrong with it. Every weird thing that should be in focus. It isn't. And it drives me
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:24.240]  crazy. I hate that ad because it bothers me so much at how bad it looks and that Apple put it on
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:30.080]  TV, but look, Apple wouldn't have put it on TV if Apple thought that it made them look bad. And so
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:36.640]  it's me, I have to say, it's me. I am overthinking this and that most people don't care. And I do
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:40.880]  think that's true. I think it needs to be better. I think they need to shoot it at higher quality
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:46.480]  because right now I think it's limited to 1080, but they'll get there. And you know, even if
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:52.080]  they're completely delusional and the emperor has no clothes, or they decided, you know, most people
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:57.920]  are going to look at this ad and go, oh, cool. It is. And yeah, it is cool. It looks terrible,
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:02.000]  but it's cool. I had the same thought where I was, I remember seeing it. I remember I was watching,
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:08.480]  it's where I usually watch football games because why else am I not skipping the commercials? It's
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:14.160]  because I'm watching live. And I remember thinking like, Ooh, I want, you know, I could see that this,
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:19.280]  once I picked up that it was a commercial about cinematic mode, I was like, I wonder if they shot
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:24.960]  this with cinematic mode. And then like the focus racked again to the black detective who was
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:30.480]  in the driver's seat. And I was like, well, the focus isn't quite right on half of his face.
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:38.480]  And I was like, so they definitely did. But it's because I was watching it on my big 65-inch TV,
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:44.160]  you know, like, and it defeats the point of, oh, well, cinematic mode and portrait mode, the details
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:48.640]  don't matter because people just look at the pictures and the videos on their phones. So,
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:52.720]  and it's like, no, Apple's putting it onto 70-inch TVs. Right?
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:59.040]  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's very brave of them. And I think that I'm inclined to believe it's because
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:03.680]  most people don't notice the stuff that we notice. And I think us holding them to a higher standard
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:09.440]  is good and saying this stuff needs to be better because once you notice it, it's really hard not
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:15.360]  to notice it after then, but just because it could be a lot better, it doesn't mean it's not fun.
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:19.680]  And in my review, I said much the same thing, right? Which is it's fun. It looks cool. It's
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:24.320]  like, oh my God, now I've got the fuzzy background and the sharp foreground. Like I'm using a long
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:29.680]  lens, except it's just with my iPhone. Like it is fun. And you know what, if it's really bad,
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:33.040]  you just turn it off and then you just get a normal video. It's fine.
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:38.320]  Yeah. Well, and it's, it is amazing too, that you, you can just after shooting,
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:43.840]  turn it off and just go and just get the full depth of field that the camera was, was taking in.
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:50.000]  And so like, if you shot this amazing thing and it's, you know, you've captured, you know,
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.760]  the first alien to land on earth and you've shot it with cinematic photo on your iPhone and CNN
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:59.120]  wants to give you all this money for it. And it's like, oh, the alien's out of focus. Well,
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:03.360]  you could just turn off cinematic mode and now, now your footage, you know, you can make all
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:08.800]  the money from CNN and whoever else wants to bid on your, on your footage. So it doesn't, you know,
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:17.040]  it doesn't hurt you to shoot it, to try shooting it. Yeah. Yeah. What else with iPhone? I don't
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:25.520]  know that I have much more time to move on to iPad. Yeah. Well, iPad got to be 3.7 holding
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:32.800]  steady. One of the few that was steady, but slowly decreasing over time. 2017 was up at 4.1. What
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:38.640]  happened in 2017 that it shot up? I don't remember. Was that when the iPad pros first, I think it
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:46.160]  might've been the new iPad pro with the face ID 20, 2016 was low. And in 2017 shot up to 4.1 then
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:55.920]  4.0 then 3.9. Now two years of 3.7. This is, this is the one category. And again, there's a couple
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:22:01.360]  of comments I have highlighted. Here's Carolina Milanessi, I believe you would pronounce it.
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:05.360]  Milanessi. Carolina Milanessi. Yeah. Carolina Milanessi. What a pretty name.
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:14.000]  Maybe because of the success of the Mac, the iPad updates felt very incremental this year. I feel
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.400]  the magic keyboard is holding the iPad pro back. I thought that was such an interesting sentiment
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:26.320]  and I feel like the way she phrased it captures something. A lot of, a lot of commenters on the
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:33.280]  report cards talked like they're still unhappy with multitasking on iPad. And I feel like
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:38.480]  putting it on the hardware is an interesting way of doing it. Cause at first we were like this
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:42.800]  magic keyboard two years ago, this is amazing. It was like, I think it was like two years ago
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:47.840]  next month when it came out and out of the blue mid year, not when we were expecting something
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:57.440]  like a major OS feature like mouse cursor support and a full track pad support and command tabbing
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:02.880]  and all this stuff. This is great. And yet everybody's still not happy.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:11.760]  Yeah. I think, I think the truth is, and this is, I think we talked about it last year,
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:18.160]  Apple chose to brand the new iPad pro as an M one. And I thought that was a really interesting
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:23.680]  choice because they could have fibbed, right. They could have said, well, this is actually the
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:31.440]  a 14 X, even if it was literally the M one, they could have put it in the context of an iPad chip.
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:35.360]  And they instead decided to say, no, this is the same chip that's in the Mac book air.
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:42.800]  It's the same. And I like, they decided that the good will of everybody about Apple Silicon
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:47.360]  was something they wanted to rub off on the iPad pro. And I think that that is a great decision,
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:54.480]  but it also calls into question the software on the iPad pro because it's the same hardware
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:59.840]  theoretically underneath. And yet you can do so much less on the iPad in iPad iOS than you can on
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:08.160]  the Mac and macOS. And it has led to a frustration, a continued, but now intensified frustration in
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:16.080]  the slow pace of iPad iOS updates. And I think a bunch of people who have been trying to view the
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:23.360]  iPad as the future. Who per our last conversation about the Mac have now sort of said, Oh, actually
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:29.920]  the Mac is riding high. And this new M one Mac book air or Mac book pro gives me much more of
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:35.040]  what I want and are sort of like off the iPad a little bit. David Sparks had an amazing quote in
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:40.240]  there, which is basically like, I, I have just come to accept that Apple doesn't view this thing
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:45.680]  as a replacement for the Mac, but as an interim step between the Mac and the iPhone. And I, and
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:49.680]  I've been much happier. He, I'm paraphrasing him, but he's like, and I've been much happier since
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:54.720]  I just accepted it. And I think that there is some truth to that, at least so far in terms of
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:59.760]  looking at the evidence of where the iPad is. And I think I love my iPad. I still use it all
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:04.160]  the time. I think it's in a, it's in a nice place. I think there is so much more potential.
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:12.000]  But does Apple at this point want to unleash the iPad and turn it into something that is even more
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  Mac-like or is it kind of okay with it where it is in the in the ecosystem? And I don't know, I,
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.160]  I could go either way on that. I, I want them to keep pushing it at the high end because they've
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:29.040]  shown now they can differentiate and you can have a low end iPad and iPad air and an iPad pro, and
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:34.960]  you can sell them all. And people use them in very different ways and it's okay, but I am not
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:39.840]  convinced that Apple thinks it's worth it for them to push that hard up at the high end with more
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:44.800]  Mac-like features. And even though they've got the Mac chip in there, like we all know it could run
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:50.880]  Final Cut Pro or Logic Pro. We know, we all know it could, but Apple has just never released those
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:55.760]  apps, even though they've got a thing called the iPad Pro. We, with the M1, it's like there's no
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:04.880]  disputing it now. It should be as fast as a MacBook Air. So now what's the excuse? And, and,
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:08.800]  and I think everybody's just sort of like, all right, I guess Apple's just, I sensed a little
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:12.800]  bit of defeatism where they're just sort of like, okay, I guess Apple's just never going to do this,
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:17.600]  so maybe we should just give up. Yeah. Uh, Marco's comment, iPadOS's efforts to add
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:23.360]  powerful features without ruining its simplicity, simplicity have always left me wanting both far
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:28.960]  more and far less. I'm starting, I'm starting to think that such a balance cannot be struck.
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:34.960]  Uh, and in any way, and I'm like, yeah, that's a good way to put it, man. That's a sharp comment,
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:39.600]  Marco. And then he says, but if it could be, it would probably require far more effort than Apple
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:46.000]  is currently investing. And I think that's, yeah. And it's like, cause why bother really, if it
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.440]  would, if you, if you kind of have a concept floating around and there's, you know, a plan
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:58.160]  inside Apple of what we could do this and here's, you know, a hour long thing of what we could do
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:05.280]  to take iPadOS into more Mac territory. And then, you know, like a ballpark estimate of how much
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:09.600]  work it would be and how much time and who would take off other products. Why bother? We already
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:15.200]  have the Mac, you know? Right. Especially if our vision of the future of our software platforms is
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:21.040]  a unified software platform that runs everywhere, then if the app that you write that runs on the
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:26.480]  iPad when it's in a tablet configuration runs on a Mac on a big screen and works just as well,
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:31.200]  do you need an iPad that runs on a big screen? Do you, you know, do you really need these extra
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:36.480]  usage modes of the iPad? If the world you're going to is a world where the Mac is going to be able to
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:41.520]  run that same software, right? Like, and I think that that's what they plan is that in the long run
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:46.720]  Apple soft, the Mac will run like legacy Mac software fine, but like all other software for
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:51.840]  Apple's platforms will just be, you know, everywhere. It'll be everywhere. And, and
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:58.080]  and instead of having the iPad be like a lifeboat where it's like, how do we get to the future?
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:04.880]  If the Mac is dead, the Mac's not dead now. So what is the iPad for? And like somebody asked me,
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:10.400]  I was, I was a, a big proponent of the idea of, of Apple trying to do an iOS laptop at some point,
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:15.520]  which, you know, the magic keyboard sort of will make its laptop ish, right? I I'm totally off of
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:20.000]  that now because I look at it and I think, well, why like, you've got, you've got an M1 MacBook
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.800]  Air that will run apps from the app store. Like you're, you're basically there. It doesn't do
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:30.400]  touch, but you're so close. So, so is Apple and it's not that it wouldn't be fun. It's like,
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:34.400]  is Apple going to put in the work to do that? Or is Apple going to be like, you know what?
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:38.480]  That adds a lot of complexity. It's going to be a lot of work. It might even undercut our lower
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:44.960]  end iPads a little bit. Hmm. Maybe not. And I think as a big proponent of the iPad, that's kind
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:50.560]  of what I'm feeling right now is I, I, I need Apple to give me a sign. Otherwise I'm just going
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:54.640]  to kind of assume that the iPad is going to be what it's going to be. You can't magically do it
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:58.880]  all. And that's why Marco's comment really resonated with me is like, you can't be both
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:05.120]  less and more. Yeah. And so you kind of have to pick and choose where you're going to put these
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:12.960]  three platforms, iPhone, iPad, Mac. And yes, the one thing that is very obvious is that Apple is
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:21.440]  doing it in a way that even a casual observer of the company could see that they're a company that
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:30.160]  makes all three of these products and that there's a role for all three. Whereas if they did not make
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:37.200]  Macs, I know that's a very hard idea for someone of, of like me and you to imagine,
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:44.000]  but if they didn't, if they really only started from the iPod and then made the iPhone and the
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:49.920]  iPhone and iPad were exactly like, we know them, but the Mac wasn't there. Yeah. I think that they
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:56.960]  would grow the iPad in ways to take share away from windows, laptops, you know, but they have
[01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:03.280]  the Mac. And so that's not who they are. And in the same way, if they didn't have the iPad,
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:07.120]  if they had never figured out how to make touch screen things, maybe, you know, the Mac would have
[01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:13.680]  a touch screen and there'd be a MacBook model with a detachable, you know, you could unsnap the
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:19.920]  display part, like a lot of windows two and ones do, you know, like along the lines of the way the
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:26.400]  iPad works with the magic keyboard, whether it actually snaps on the back or magnetically
[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:32.000]  attaches like Apple's does. You don't have to be a cynic to say that they want to make them
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:37.360]  distinctive, but I think that's where we're left. And that those of us who were into it enough
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:43.120]  and really would like, even if you don't see the exact design for how the iPad could be better,
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:48.160]  you can feel the ways that it could be better. And it's like, ah, just feel like this. And,
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:52.240]  and I do think, I think you made a very keen point that by calling it the M1,
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:57.360]  boy, it just raised people's expectations for how, how many things they could do.
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:31:02.800]  Yeah. And I don't get me wrong. I feel like the iPad and some of the multitasking changes that
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:09.840]  they made in, in the latest iPad iOS update, um, get them on the door of doing windowing
[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:14.240]  on iPad iOS, basically that, that I could see it's all the pieces are there. I think
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:18.720]  I really think they could, if Apple makes like an external display that they could say,
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:24.480]  and if you plug an iPad into it and a keyboard and mouse, it just works right. Like it and,
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:29.440]  and instead of using full screen, you, you were going to do windowing or tiling or something like
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:33.760]  that. Like, I think they totally could do that now. I think they're very, very close.
[01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:40.080]  What gives me pause is that. Do they want to, do they want to open up that can of worms at all?
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:45.760]  Um, they they're taking baby steps here and there, but I don't think there's a rush to
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:51.440]  fill a lot of these ecological niches with the iPad. Like there maybe was a few years ago,
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:56.240]  just because, um, partially because their focus has been on the Mac, but also because the results
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:32:02.000]  on the Mac have been so strong. And. You know, again, don't get me wrong. I really like my iPad
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:07.760]  apps. I'll also point out universal control, which is now in beta at last. And so was not part of
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:12.720]  this survey. A few people mentioned like, we haven't seen it. And by the time I posted the
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:17.600]  survey, we'd seen it. So I took some of those comments out, but like universal control. One
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:22.080]  of the things that I love about it is that. Um, when you move your mouse over and now you're on
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:26.480]  the iPad, you're running iPad apps and it works like you're using a magic keyboard. It works
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:32.240]  exactly like you'd expect if you used iPad iOS in that way. And it's almost like Apple saying,
[01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:37.680]  you know, yes, the iPad is good as an iPad. And if you want to run it from your keyboard
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:43.920]  and your trackpad, you can, and it works great as its own thing. Um, but is that as far as they're
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:49.840]  willing to go and, and. Again, it's not as if I think that they're not technically close to being
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:53.440]  able to do more, but they would have to show the will right. They'd have to show the will to
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:58.320]  embrace bigger screens. They would, which means probably windowing and they would have to have
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:04.640]  the will to embrace, um, honestly doing this, embarking on a software project to bring some
[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:08.960]  of those pro apps to like really put a stake in the ground and say, yes, you can edit video
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:14.560]  on the iPad using final cut pro. And I realized that's probably a huge job, but like the fact
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:18.960]  that we haven't seen in all these years suggest to me that Apple is like, maybe we don't actually
[01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:23.120]  want to do that. They're very proud of the video editing apps that are in the app store and the
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:26.960]  audio editing apps that are in the app store. They're very proud of those. They, they throw a
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:31.600]  lot of love to those third-party developers. They do it's a LumaFusion and fair, right. And stuff
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:36.480]  like that. But as for their, as for themselves, they're like, nah, we're not going to do it. So
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:42.160]  I think Apple's enthusiasm for the iPad goes, you know, this far, but no further.
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:45.760]  Trenton Larkin It does tie into pro apps,
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:50.720]  come up a lot. The one that hits me a lot, and I've mentioned this on the show before, and I'm
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:56.160]  not even complaining. I'm glad that they're moving the iPad forward. They, they really have addressed
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:34:01.280]  a lot of my biggest complaints from three, four or five years ago, three, maybe three years ago,
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:07.440]  especially with multitasking, when I wrote at length, you know, got a lot off my chest.
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:19.120]  But I still feel, I feel lucky that the iPad to me is the least, the least not, not loved, but the,
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:26.480]  the, the, it's the one that gets lost in the shuffle. And like one example, I think,
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:32.240]  Steven trout and Smith, and I've talked about this offline, but it just seems weird to me,
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:38.480]  like really weird from a philosophical perspective, that they've added, like,
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:43.120]  when you have a magic keyboard, or, or any keyboard attached to your iPad,
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:48.720]  and you hold down the command key, you get like this heads up display that shows you a bunch of
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:54.960]  it's like the the iPad version of a menu bar. And it's organized in a similar way, like file and
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:35:01.040]  edit and, you know, like omni outliner will say outline and, and they show you the keyboard
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:06.240]  commands that you can use. And you can tap them if you want it because once it's showing, but if you
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:10.560]  don't have a keyboard attached, you don't get that there's then there's no there's no affordance to
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:16.720]  bring up, give me that menu bar, right. So there is sort of like a menu bar for iPad apps. But you
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:20.960]  only get it when there's a hardware keyboard attached. There's no other way to invoke it.
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:27.840]  There's no op even like a system wide option to like, in certain apps that have this,
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:32.640]  make a little thing, you know, like the, like the little pencil thing that shows up or you
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:37.760]  can pick different right pens, and show me the menu commands that are available. It's
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:43.040]  it seems very odd. And they're the right on the again, this is what I'm saying about they're right
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:47.040]  on the on the precipice there. I feel like they've got all the pieces, but are they going
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:52.880]  to walk through the door? And I'm not sure they ever are. But it's funny. I mean, the the tea leaf
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:58.320]  reading criminal criminologist version would be like, aha, they put it all together, and now they
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:02.080]  will strike. But there's another part of me that sort of the iPad user who's been waiting way too
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:06.160]  long, who's like, they're never going to do it. They're gonna, they're gonna, they're gonna tinker
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:12.400]  around the edges. But never really break through that door and say, No, now we're gonna do it.
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:15.600]  We're really, really gonna do it. And I hope I'm wrong. Honestly, I didn't think they were
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:21.120]  ever going to add proper pointer support in iPadOS. And they did that. And that that has
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:25.920]  had lots of benefits in other areas like universal control, right? It doesn't make sense if you don't
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:34.640]  have that support in there. But to fully embrace this on that level, and say, yeah, menu bars,
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:38.720]  because catalyst apps will take that menu bar stuff and actually put it in the menu bar on the Mac,
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:44.640]  right? It's like, you could have a system standard widget that showed the menu, right? And it
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:48.880]  wouldn't have to be a bar. And they're like, and the windowing could be windows if you wanted it
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:54.160]  to be instead of just multitasking. But are like, do they want to break the seal on that? And it
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:59.520]  may be that they they had had too much else going on, right? And they're like, let's wait on on
[01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:04.720]  redefining what the iPad is, because that is a big thing. Or it may be one of my pet theories,
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:09.520]  it may be that they really aren't going to add external display support to an iPad until they've
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:14.000]  got an external display to sell. Right. Right. I don't know. Right. We didn't mention that with
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.640]  the Mac, we should have that that was the big recurring complaint. Right. It almost goes without
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:24.960]  saying at this point, look, there's got to be a display of retina quality display. That's less
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:32.240]  than $5,000. Yeah, proper Apple display that is not the Pro Display XDR. The other one with iPad
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:37.600]  that gets me it's a pet peeve of mine. But I know I know that it's not like this obscure class
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:43.680]  of utility for the Mac. It's it's actually a type of utility that there are like, it's hard
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:47.840]  to make a recommendation for somebody because I could think of at least six really good ones, but
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:55.440]  clipboard managers, right? Like so yeah, a pay spot is one that I use keyboard maestro has one
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:38:00.880]  built in launch bar has one built in that I use that one. I love it. But anyway, the basic idea
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:06.480]  if you've never used one, you should get one for your Mac. But what it is is it when you copy
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:12.880]  stuff, it'll you could set this utility up to say, remember the last 50 things I copy or 100 or
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:17.040]  something, you know, you could it it's actually you think like 100 I don't want to be greedy.
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:20.880]  And you're like, actually, it that's fine. You've got plenty of space on your computer,
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:26.080]  you can save them. And then you when when you're like, you want to paste something and I was like,
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:29.920]  Oh, I copied something else two minutes ago, I don't have that thing anymore. You just have
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:34.480]  one keyboard shortcut. There it is, you can just go down or you want to copy three very specific
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:38.080]  things from one place and then switch somewhere else and paste three very specific things.
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:41.760]  Instead of going back and forth and back and forth, you copy, copy, copy and then go and
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:47.760]  paste paste paste paste. Yeah, you can't do that on iPad OS. And that is one of the every time
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:52.960]  when I'm like working in my kitchen on my iPad. And I've said this, you know, like a lot of times,
[01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:58.800]  it's like I really would be more productive if I just only read on my iPad. And as soon as I
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:04.080]  start doing like that, in some ways, the magic keyboard as much as I like it, I really it makes
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:09.120]  me happy to use my iPad connected to it. But I actually think I lose productivity because it
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:14.560]  keeps me in my kitchen drinking coffee in the kitchen, then going downstairs to my office and
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:19.920]  using my Mac. And one of the things that will trigger me to say you know what, get your ass up,
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:25.600]  go and start doing your work on the Mac is if I suddenly like, ah, I need a clipboard manager
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:29.760]  because I need to copy three things. And I think you know what, you shouldn't be doing this on your
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:34.960]  iPad. And I totally get it. Totally get why the iPhone doesn't have it. Although I kind of wish
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:39.760]  it could have it. But I see how it's less of a need. But the iPad should be able to have utilities
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:46.160]  like that. Yeah, I think that's the, when you look at iOS and macOS and compare them, sometimes what
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:50.480]  people do is they look at the base feature set, and they don't look at the features that are
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:56.000]  enabled by third party utilities. And we could have a conversation actually about the fact that
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.400]  macOS probably should have multiple keyboard or multiple clipboard support
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:07.200]  built into it. Like it's a very, very old school Mac concept of what that clipboard is. And it
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:11.280]  probably should be a little more dynamic and have more of a history, but leaving it to the third
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:16.400]  parties is fine. But you have to enable that, which means that iPad OS would need, or iOS would
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:22.880]  need to enable a clipboard history or clipboard management API. And of course there are privacy
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:29.840]  issues. There are security issues. Totally get it, but you could, you could enable it. Or if you
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:33.760]  decide that it's too much, you could enable that feature yourself in the operating system. And it's
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:39.600]  it's just on the list. I agree. I settled down to do text editing on, on an iPad with a Magic
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:45.680]  keyboard or with a, or with that Keychron Bluetooth keyboard, actually. I'll do it there too.
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:53.360]  And that's the one that always gets me is I realized that I have sort of in my mind copied
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:58.960]  something new, knowing I can get back to the previous thing I copied and I can't. And individual
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:03.600]  apps can kind of do it, but like, it's just, you got to have it everywhere. It has to be system
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:08.560]  wide and yeah, it's on my list. It's like, you know, I'm audio hijack is another example of
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:12.400]  that too, where it's like Apple doesn't have to build system sound routing features. The
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:18.320]  max sound. Base sound support is actually shockingly another area where Apple could do
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:27.440]  better sound routing itself. It's chosen not to. And so apps like, uh, sound source and, uh, audio
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:32.560]  hijack and all these other rogue Amoeba apps step into, um, the, the breach there and they,
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:38.800]  they fix it. And I rely on those apps all the time, multiple rogue Amoeba apps all the time.
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:44.320]  And they can't, there's no sound API like that on iPad. So they just, you just can't do stuff
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:49.760]  like be a podcaster and travel with an iPad because the functionality just doesn't exist.
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:55.920]  Like iPad and iPhone are still back in the days where literally like one app can control
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:42:01.440]  audio. Like it's, it's, it's like everything else is multitasking, but not audio.
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:07.120]  Doesn't happen. And I really do feel like it's just something it's that whole area that it's
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:13.040]  just, it, it just sort of falls through the cracks of, well, you don't need it on the iPhone
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:18.320]  and you could just use a Mac. So, you know, not, not like they're saying no to it, but
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:24.240]  it's never bubbles up to a high enough priority. Right. And, and on that, you know, and I get the
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:28.880]  privacy issues, but it's like, they do all, they, they allow all sorts of things that,
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:34.640]  that aren't necessarily private and you have to opt into like third-party keyboards, right? Like
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:40.080]  the third-party software keyboards. That's, that's the perfect example, which is there are rules and
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:45.440]  you have to ask for an entitlement and there is a warning and you have to say yes. And so if you
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:50.880]  have a clipboard manager and it says friend, you know, clipboard manager wants to look at your
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:55.200]  clipboard and remember your history and every, you know, they're going to see everything you copy
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:59.600]  and it's going to put a little thing up in the status bar that says your clipboard is being
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:06.800]  watched or whatever. Like, okay, fine. Do that. Yeah. I feel like the, if there was any progress
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:14.560]  on that front inside Apple, that the whole kerfuffle last year of controversy over apps,
[01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:20.640]  looking at the clipboard without permission, it might've put the kibosh on that because it was
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:25.200]  just bad publicity, right? And even though it was mostly innocuous and most of the apps that
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:32.640]  were doing it, weren't doing it to do anything nefarious, they just wanted to, like a deliveries
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:37.680]  app would just want to look at the clipboard to see if it looks like you have a FedEx URL on the
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:42.480]  clipboard and then helpfully suggest, Hey, it looks like you have a FedEx delivery. Would you
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:47.680]  delivery? Would you like to track it? You know, because me, the app telling you this is a delivery
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:53.600]  tracking app. It seems like something you might want to do, right? It's, but it, it generated some
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:58.560]  bad publicity, but I just feel the keyboard thing is an example, but I feel like keyboards, third
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:03.680]  party keyboards made it because that was for the phone and there was no other way to do it. Where
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:10.560]  is the, where the iPad is the middle, the middle platform just sort of loses, loses out. Yeah. I
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:16.720]  mean, the, the positive way I would view the iPadOS split in terms of name from iOS is it seemed to be
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:20.880]  Apple saying, we understand iPad needs some features that the iPhone isn't going to get.
[01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:23.920]  And we're going to, we're going to look at that. And this would be a great example of that. There
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:27.520]  are lots of these things that are like, it doesn't really need to be on the iPhone. It could be,
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:31.840]  but doesn't really need to be, but this is like, this is one that, that the iPad, anything that's
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:38.480]  got a proper keyboard interface and apps that are trying to do more stuff. And again, maybe it's a
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:42.800]  system level thing. If you're really worried about security, one thing you could do as Apple is have
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:47.760]  a clipboard API that allows you to set certain things to not be, not be copy or saveable in the
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:52.960]  history or, or to have an expiration date. And like you could build a system that is fairly,
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:58.400]  and that is opt in that is fairly secure where you have to say, is it okay if I share my clipboard
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:02.960]  with the system, but it, it takes effort and they've got to prioritize it. And I think it
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:08.320]  comes back to it being the middle kid in Apple's platforms right now. Right. All right. Let me
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:12.240]  take a break here and thank our third and final sponsor of the show. Our good friends at Trade

[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:26.320]  combination of wearables with watch has gotten to be problematic report card wise because I
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:31.520]  part of the thing is you want to be consistent year over year. Yep. And so you want to ask,
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:39.040]  I ask about both, right? And that's new. I actually added the wearables category late
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:43.920]  because originally was an Apple watch category. It was right when the watch came out is when we
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:48.320]  started this. And so that was, that was like, all right, let's talk about all Apple's platforms,
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:53.280]  but then they changed the category to wearables in their financials and AirPods came out.
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:59.120]  And I feel like we needed to be more expansive with that question. So for the last few years,
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:05.920]  I've been asking both one, one set of comments, but two scores, I think in the long run,
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:11.360]  what I have to do is just retire Apple watch as a category. And maybe that'll happen next year
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:17.280]  and just sort of go with the wearable score, but I'm in the interest of continuity. I'm,
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:21.280]  I'm basically doing both because you know, the score is a little bit lower because I think
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:26.160]  people really love the AirPods. And so the scores haven't ever quite converged. The wearable score
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:30.800]  is a little bit higher because you're rolling in other Apple products on top of the Apple watch.
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:37.040]  And I think that's about right. I think as, as much as I like my Apple watch, I feel like
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:42.960]  wearables is a nicer bucket to ask people about because it does include some of Apple's other
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:47.520]  stuff that it's doing. And perhaps there will be more wearables from Apple in the near future.
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:51.840]  I don't know. Right. And, and the obvious thing to do would be instead of retiring Apple watch
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:58.160]  would be to just break them into two separate categories. But I actually feel like this famous
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:03.440]  last words it's it's along the lines of 640 kilobytes ought to be enough memory for anybody,
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:10.480]  but Apple watch, I feel like the score is lower because it is nearing completion. Not,
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:15.440]  not that they're never going to improve it, but that it's, it's getting so incremental
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:20.880]  in terms of where, what else can it reasonably do? And I know there are other health sensors
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:25.360]  they could add, and I'm sure they will, you know, whether it's going to be this year or next year
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:32.000]  and, and, you know, and, and rumors about a rugged one that Gurman has reported, like a G-Shock style
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:39.040]  watch, there's certainly new things they could do. But I do kind of feel though that in broad strokes
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:46.400]  that the watch has caught up to what it, what technology could let it be. Right. It's like,
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:52.000]  you know, that like when the first version of watch came out and apps were slow, it's like,
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:57.440]  well, the apps could be faster because Apple's built in software is faster. Right. So the third
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:02.720]  party apps being so slow, this was not endemic to the hardware. This is a problem that needs to be
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:10.320]  solved. And I, I don't want to read too much into personnel moves at Apple, but I kind of feel like
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:19.200]  Kevin Lynch going to project Titan is a sign. And I think he's still ostensibly still running
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:25.680]  watchOS too, but I think it's a clear sign though, that there's not as much on his plate for the
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:31.920]  watch as there were in the early years when it was, Hey, we don't even have a, you know, a,
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:37.600]  you know, a electrocardiogram sensor. We have to add that. Right. Well, I mean, I started,
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:42.240]  I started six colors and we did the report card and the Apple watch came out like literally my
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:47.040]  last week. My next to last day at Mac world was the day the Apple watch was announced. So
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:50.960]  Apple watch is about as old as six colors. It's six colors is older cause the Apple watch didn't
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:58.800]  ship for a while, but in the ballpark. Right. So I it's been around a while now. And I think you're
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:04.880]  right. I think, I think it has reached a point technologically where there's still plenty to be
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:11.840]  done there, but it's kind of motoring along and has been very successful. But also I would say
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:15.680]  that at, at those early days, when I was asking people about Apple watch, I think there was a
[01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:23.600]  perception that Apple's platforms had grown a new leg. Right. And it was iPhone, Mac, iPad,
[01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:30.400]  and Apple watch and maybe Apple TV. Right. And if you view it through today's eyes, I mean,
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:35.280]  and I love my Apple watch. I wear an Apple watch all the time. I run with my Apple watch. In fact,
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:42.160]  I do an Apple watch only a run. I run an intervals training app on my Apple watch. And I listen to
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:47.120]  podcasts on my Apple watch and I'm wearing AirPods and my phone doesn't come with me.
[01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:52.240]  It's a cellular Apple watch. I just don't take my phone with me. And so I'm doing it. It's not just
[01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:57.680]  a peripheral, right? It is more than that. But if you really look at it in the grand scheme of
[01:51:57.680 --> 01:52:04.320]  things, is it like an iPhone or an iPad or a Mac? It's not, it is like an like AirPods. It is
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:10.960]  another platform for Apple, but it's kind of in this sort of like constellation of extra devices
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:20.160]  that are incremental. They add to your life in Apple's ecosystem. And, and, and so I'm not
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:28.000]  throwing shade at the Apple watch when I say it is another product in Apple's lineup, but it,
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:34.560]  but it is like, it is important. But it's not at that same level and it's, and it, and it fits
[01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:39.120]  with something like AirPods. And honestly, a VR product would be in this category too,
[01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:46.480]  of something that is very interesting, but not necessarily, um, worth breaking out yet. And I
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:49.760]  don't think the Apple watch is ever going to be that. Like the Apple watch is never going to be
[01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:54.480]  the next iPhone. It was never really going to be, but it's certainly, it's more of an accessory
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:53:01.200]  product like the AirPods are. And that's not a bad thing. AirPods are great. So I think in the end,
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:07.200]  yeah, I, I'm gonna probably roll this all together into officially just calling it wearables. I mean,
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:12.400]  I've already sort of demoted Apple watch to a subset of the wearables category, but, um,
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:16.960]  but it's sort of the one place I've made a change to my survey and it's mostly because of perception.
[01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:20.960]  Like when, when, when we started, we were very excited about the Apple watch and now it's really
[01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:25.520]  more of the wearables category and a whole bunch of other stuff goes in there and that's okay. I
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:31.440]  think that's okay. Yeah. I, and I def there's definitely more enthusiasm for the AirPods and
[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:37.040]  it, you know, it's, it's, it's just that they've, they're still, you know, they're a couple, they
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:42.080]  came a couple of years later, they've got more room to grow and it was a big year for AirPods.
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:46.240]  I guess that the air, when did AirPods max come out? Did they come out last year or did they come
[01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:52.320]  out? I think the max was last year, but the new AirPods were this year and spatial audio update
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:58.480]  was this year. And it, and maybe a lot of people didn't get a chance to even try it. 21, the year
[01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:01.920]  covered in the survey, not the current year we're in. Cause I know that's complicated, but yeah.
[01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:08.880]  Right. But it's, you know, the AirPods max are still relatively new and it's, you know,
[01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:15.120]  just lots of new stuff that the third generation regular AirPods pick up some really nice features
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:22.640]  from the AirPods Pro. And it, like I wrote in my comment, I know there are people, I have so many
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:29.680]  friends who hate sealed earbuds and the design of the AirPods Pro requires them to be sealed
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:35.120]  in your ear canal. Some people either find it physically uncomfortable, hate the sensation,
[01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:40.240]  whatever. It's just great that, and there's a spot in the lineup and it's great that they kept the
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:44.320]  older AirPods, which are still, this is one of the older products that it's good that I think that
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:49.360]  they've kept around at a lower price because it's still a good product and they lowered the price
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:56.400]  significantly as opposed to like my upcoming complaint about the Apple TV. Yep. Yeah. And
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:59.920]  people love, people love them. I mean, I know that there are details and some people don't like the
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:04.160]  shape of the new ones and all that, but in general, is there an Apple product that you can think of in
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:09.440]  recent ages that has not been essentially acclaimed by everyone like the AirPods? Like they're just,
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:15.360]  you know, they're great. And I was super skeptical of them and I am now primarily,
[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:21.200]  other than when I'm doing podcasts, I'm using AirPods Pro and I love them. So I think they've
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:24.880]  done, and I know some people love the Max and like they've got a product line now where they've got
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:29.120]  different models and different places for different people and it's all going, you know,
[01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:32.160]  that part of their, it's funny when you think about the home strategy and how it's kind of
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:35.840]  a disaster, then you think about the, something like the AirPods and like, yeah, but they nailed
[01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:43.360]  that one. So the Apple's capable of really completely acing a product. They just, you know,
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:48.480]  some of their products haven't been there, but the AirPods is a good example of Apple putting all of
[01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:54.560]  its skill and all of its understanding of certain product categories. And I would say maybe all the
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:56:02.320]  lessons that learned from the iPod and making a great set of headphones. Yeah. Apple TV got a C,
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:09.040]  got a C, but that's an upgrade. Way up. People are like, how, how is it that Apple TV went up by
[01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:15.120]  more than anything else in the survey? I'm like, well, first off it had a, it had a 2.1. So it was
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:21.920]  a D minus or an F, I guess it was technically it was an F last year. It was an F came up to a C,
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:30.320]  a huge move. And people also were saying, really Apple TV, three out of five. Like that seems like
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:35.520]  a lot. And it's like, okay, you got to understand this is giving water to a dying man in the desert.
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:42.480]  That remote, they changed the remote. Everybody mentioned the remote and, and as silly as it is,
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:47.120]  because Apple TV has a lot of core problems in the fact that they, it's not affordable.
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:54.080]  They have real competition in this category from Amazon and Google and Roku. Apple is,
[01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:58.720]  it does not have the exclusivity that it used to because it's put its stuff on all of those
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:04.720]  other platforms. And all of that said, and the fact that it's it's hardware is still kind of
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:09.200]  stale, even though they did do an update to it, there's no entry-level model that's cheaper,
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:17.120]  that's more price competitive. All of that, again, all of that granted, that update to the remote
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:23.680]  gave people just a big shot of adrenaline. And I will say, and I know I'm not the only one who
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:30.720]  said this, but that remote led to a chain of events in my life where I canceled my cable,
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:39.360]  pulled, got rid of my TiVo, pulled out all my other devices and now am a one remote living room.
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:45.440]  And it's that Apple remote. And, and it was the, cause it was so good that I started getting
[01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:52.880]  frustrated that only my Apple TV was, worked with it. And so I just said, we're just going to replace
[01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:58.560]  everything else. And I, and I did that. So it can be a life-changing bit of technology. Is it,
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:03.520]  is it truly a measure of the Apple TV as a platform three out of five? I don't think so.
[01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:07.680]  I think this number is going to go back down next year. Cause the, the novelty of that remote will
[01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:12.800]  work, will wear off. But I think everybody wanted to give Apple a little gold star for finally
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:17.920]  canning the bad remote and replacing it. I do think there's something strange about the, the,
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:25.840]  the Apple TV malaise is that Apple to me as often at its best, when they're the underdog,
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:30.480]  that's a comment I have written down for Apple talking. There was a nice comment about Apple
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:34.480]  card and it's like, well, they're entering this market where people are generally pretty happy
[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:40.560]  with their credit cards. So they are the underdog to try to convince people to, to upgrade to a new
[01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:47.840]  thing. And it, you know, it's human nature. Like when you're, when you don't have competition and
[01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:52.400]  you've been successful, you get lazy, right? You take stuff for granted. And, you know, that's
[01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:57.120]  the big part of the argument we're seeing about the app store, you know, that, that, that maybe
[01:58:57.120 --> 01:59:02.720]  they're, they're not really competing for that 30% of the 70, 30%. They just take it for granted
[01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:08.880]  at this point. And that's not a good place to be, but that it's so confounding that Apple TV has
[01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:13.520]  always, maybe not always, cause maybe they were actually ahead of the curve when, when like Steve
[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:18.800]  Jobs introduced the first one and they were going to call it ITV. And it was a rumor. And the idea
[01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:26.560]  of putting a consumer computer connected to your TV was still sort of new ish. But at this point,
[01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:31.040]  they are behind, right? Like you, it's hard to find anybody who writes about this stuff,
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:36.960]  who doesn't say, look, you know, you can have opinions that you might like the Apple software
[01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:42.720]  better, or it integrates with some things like AirPlay better. There's reasons I like it, but
[01:59:43.280 --> 01:59:50.480]  it's really hard for most people to see that this is worth the price premium versus the Fire TV or
[01:59:50.480 --> 01:59:56.560]  the Roku or, or, or just using whatever's built into their TV. So why isn't it lit a fire under
[01:59:56.560 --> 02:00:03.360]  Apple to like, make it better and market in a way that makes people say, oh, that's why I should get
[02:00:03.360 --> 02:00:08.960]  an Apple TV. It is a little mystifying. And I wrote a piece last year where I said, why does
[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:13.440]  the Apple TV exist? And I wasn't saying they shouldn't make it. I was saying, what's the story
[02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:18.480]  here? What can we, can we come up with a story for why Apple tell me why this product exists and yet
[02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:22.880]  you don't do anything with it and you're not being aggressive with it. And the number one thing I
[02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:29.280]  heard from people was, not only is its interface still pretty good, a lot of those cheap ones that
[02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:34.320]  people talk about are slow and bad. And it is true. I have a slow and bad Amazon Fire Stick.
[02:00:34.320 --> 02:00:39.840]  It is slow and bad. I have a slow and bad Roku box. It is slow and bad. I, I, I appreciate that
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:44.400]  there are higher end ones that actually work better than those. And so, so that's part of it.
[02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:49.120]  But the big one that people said was privacy, that, that I trust Apple with the data and there
[02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:53.120]  were the stories and they're not, they're kind of overblown a little bit, but the truth is
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:01:01.360]  that Amazon and Roku and Google want to analyze some things about your TV behavior and can use
[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:06.800]  that to put ads in their interface or market things at you and all of that. And some people
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:10.720]  really don't like that. And they're like, aha, Apple doesn't do that. So that's why I like the
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:15.760]  Apple TV. And I hadn't really considered how serious people feel about that. And I think
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:22.400]  they're right. I think that is a good differentiator for Apple. However, I will say if it is really
[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:29.520]  true that Apple offers such a superior experience in terms of privacy for people who are using TV
[02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:36.240]  boxes, wouldn't you think that Apple would say, you know, what we'd have as an opportunity here,
[02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:40.640]  if we could release, even if it's just the good, better, best, and we release a base model,
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:46.080]  that's cheaper, but it gets people on the door and we can start really more at heavily advertising.
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:54.960]  Like, we're not going to watch what you watch on TV. And they should just make it an HDMI stick
[02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:59.440]  that comes free if you buy the remote because the remote is like 60 bucks, right? Yeah, but it
[02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:03.440]  comes with the box that works with the remote. And the remote is really the star here. You know,
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:09.280]  then you just plug this thing in. It's the back end of the remote. So if they did that, you know,
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:15.440]  they would presumably bring this wonderful world of privacy to many more people. But Apple,
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:20.480]  that's the part that kind of baffles me is like, I get Apple likes its profit margins and all of
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:28.000]  that, but like, is there not a cheaper Apple TV product to be sold that would improve their market
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:33.280]  share in this category, and that they could market as part of a strategy to get people to look at the
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:42.480]  Apple TV hardware? Or is it like, because now that they've moved AirPlay and Apple's video stuff to
[02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:48.480]  every connected TV and every box that's out there, basically more or less, they've lost
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:54.640]  lots of the reasons to get an Apple TV. And so the reason I wrote that story last year is like,
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:03:00.960]  where do you go from here? Like, is the Apple TV something you want to keep making at all?
[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:09.360]  Is it just a vestige or does it have a place? And I think it's actually not, Apple TV's got a lot
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:13.280]  of things wrong with it, but having used it a hundred percent of the time for my entertainment,
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:18.400]  I like it. It's actually not bad. It's actually kind of good. I like it better than the Amazon
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:25.760]  Fire by a lot and the Roku by some as well. I think people might like it, but its price is so
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:30.560]  out of whack with the alternatives that, you know, anybody who's looking at this category is going to
[02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:36.160]  be like, yeah, okay. Is it five times better than this thing? And the answer is probably not.
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:42.400]  It's just by the 20, like, cause you can get a 4k stick or a 4k box from Roku for like 29 bucks at
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:47.600]  Walmart. Like it's not even remotely close. And that's the challenge is does Apple want to play
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:53.200]  there or is, cause I worry that the Apple TV is just going to become more, well, less and less
[02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:58.080]  relevant. Let me put it that way. And, and as somebody who uses it and likes it, I would really
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:07.120]  rather just it continue on being good. And it, it that worries me. It's very strange. I'll just
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:12.720]  tack in a comment on the home pod situation, which I find to be very strange and sort of
[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:18.960]  unprecedented. I've got, I've got more full-size home pods than just about anybody. I know Marco
[02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:24.560]  maybe has me beat, but I think I've, we've got six in the house. We've got two in the kitchen,
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:28.960]  two on the TV, and I've got two in my office and I love them. And it's, it's, I've spent a lot of
[02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:34.160]  money on home pods, but I haven't spent a lot of money on speakers over the years. The home pods
[02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:39.120]  are the expensive-ish and I know that you can get crazy, crazy expensive with speakers, but
[02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:47.120]  having two home pods to try the home pod hooked up to the TV and doing it. And I was like,
[02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:54.480]  this sounds great. And my wife and son both agreed. This is great. And you're me, me, John,
[02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:58.800]  I'm the picky one. You know, if you say it's good, then fine. And I was like, I'm not even
[02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:03.440]  going to get like a different sound system. Just two home pods hooked up to the Apple TV is great.
[02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:08.000]  It's been fantastic, but it doesn't work with the home pod minis. They don't even sell. And I don't
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:13.920]  think the home pod minis, I honestly don't think they're loud enough to drive our living room TV.
[02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:18.160]  It's a fair, fairly big living room. I just don't think they're loud enough. And now there's no,
[02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:21.120]  they have this great feature and no product to, to sell with it.
[02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:26.160]  Now, now jumping a little bit into the, the, the home automation category, which is a D plus,
[02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:30.320]  by the way, is a very bad grade. It's like the teacher wrote at the top, see me,
[02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:36.320]  right? See me after class. We, we need to talk about home kit. And home pod came up in there
[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:41.680]  and several people made that same point, which is kind of a, just a, a sad statement of like,
[02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:47.680]  they have the home pod mini, which is the mini version of a product that doesn't exist anymore
[02:05:47.680 --> 02:05:52.400]  and has never been replaced. And they're getting older and they're starting to fail and you can't
[02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:57.120]  get new ones because they, they stopped making them. And there's this real question of like,
[02:05:58.240 --> 02:06:02.720]  is there another home pod coming? Is there another kind of more capable, maybe not as expensive,
[02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:07.440]  but like more capable, larger home pod model because they've updated the software on those
[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:13.360]  to do stuff like Apple TV, spatial audio and things that are not in the home pod mini even.
[02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:19.760]  And it's like, okay, good. But like, why? And is there, I assume there are other products that
[02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:24.000]  are going to be driven by this. And that's the frustration of the home category is like,
[02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:27.440]  it feels again, like Apple has making, is making some moves behind the scenes,
[02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:33.120]  but we have yet to see anything in the big picture and where we are right now is very frustrating.
[02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:37.920]  Like I think the home pod mini is fun and I think it's a great price and I think it sounds
[02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:44.720]  pretty good for what it is, but it's not one of those home pods and the home pods were overpriced
[02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:50.000]  and that's why they failed. But like, surely there is something else. I'm a big believer
[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:54.800]  in the fact that like, what frustrates me about the home category is that they're so close. And
[02:06:54.800 --> 02:07:00.160]  again, on the precipice, are they going to walk through the door? There are rumors about a home
[02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:05.040]  pod like thing that has a screen on it. That would presumably run something more like tvOS,
[02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:09.360]  but who knows? And that would have center stage on it. So you could do FaceTime calls.
[02:07:09.360 --> 02:07:13.760]  I'm like, okay, I have an Amazon echo show in my kitchen. I would love to replace it with a home
[02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:20.240]  pod with a screen. That would be cool. And then entertainment wise, whether it's a pair of big
[02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:25.760]  speakers or whether I've been flogging the idea of like a soundbar kind of thing that is an Apple TV,
[02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:32.800]  but also a speaker system that you just stick next to your TV under your TV. They've got all
[02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:38.960]  the pieces here, right? They've got the operating system that does this between the home pod and the
[02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:45.120]  tvOS operating systems. They have all the pieces. And the question is, again,
[02:07:46.880 --> 02:07:51.280]  what products are you making? Cause that's the part with home that I really don't understand
[02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:55.840]  is sort of like Apple's choices about what products it makes. And it feels a little like the
[02:07:55.840 --> 02:08:02.720]  Mac did back in the, in the darkest times where it was unclear if they knew where they wanted to take
[02:08:02.720 --> 02:08:07.840]  it. And I, my hope is that they finally come to some realization about like what products they
[02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:16.320]  can make for the home that make a difference because the home pod mini is an outlier. I hope
[02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:22.960]  it is the hint of what's to come that it's got a thread radio in it. Like, it seems like they are,
[02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:28.400]  they are about to like release a bunch of other things that follow onto the home pod mini.
[02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:32.560]  And I hope that's true because yeah, like I said, the home pod is getting along in the tooth and if
[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:37.600]  one of your home pods dies, fortunately you have many others to swap in there, but like that product
[02:08:37.600 --> 02:08:46.960]  is gone and doesn't have a replacement and it's frustrating. So yeah, D plus. Yeah. And it does,
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:52.560]  it parlays very well off the Apple TV because the Apple TV counts to me sort of as home,
[02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:56.320]  you know, and I know, I know that I actually do know from having written about this,
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:09:00.320]  that there are people who use Apple TVs in institutional settings to drive like
[02:09:02.080 --> 02:09:05.680]  presentation displays and stuff like that. And they love it. And it's great for that.
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:10.880]  And okay, I'll get it. If I was formulating this survey today, Apple TV might be rolled into home,
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:15.440]  right? It might be just part of the home category, just like Apple Watch is kind of the wearables
[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:21.840]  category. Right. So let's skip home automation. We've got, what else do we have here? We're
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:27.360]  running out services. I guess services. Services got a better score than I would have thought.
[02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:34.320]  I don't know why. Like services got to be, it's down a little bit. You know,
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:38.720]  Steven Hackett has a good one. That does seem like a glaring hole. Why doesn't Apple have a
[02:09:38.720 --> 02:09:43.520]  photo service that works for families? John Syracuse has been haranguing them about this
[02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:49.680]  on his, I think, multiple podcasts for years. It does seem like a huge oversight in a thing where
[02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:57.040]  they've done so much to add to iCloud family and have made it such a great thing and sharing apps
[02:09:57.040 --> 02:10:00.800]  and this and that. And you can, you know, one subscription and your whole family can use it
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:05.440]  on all their Apple devices and you don't, it's all very nice. And then the one thing you can't
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:11.920]  do is have a shared photo album, which is actually the way most families shared. You know, we didn't
[02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:18.720]  all have our own photo albums back in the paper days. We, you know, I don't know. And it doesn't
[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:23.280]  seem, I know famous last words. I'm sitting here in my basement podcasting telling them it's easy.
[02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:31.440]  I know it's not easy. You want to do it private. Because I write a book for Take Control every year
[02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:35.120]  about the Photos app, which is like, what does it do? And everybody's like, well, why doesn't it do
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:40.800]  this? I'm like, my book is not about what it does wrong. It's about what it does and not what it
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:45.680]  doesn't do. But I asked them at one point, I asked people on the Photos team, or at least the Photos
[02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:51.840]  marketing team, about this. And their response was, it's complicated, essentially. And I get
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:58.560]  that it is and that there's not, not in every circumstance does a, does one, you know, partner
[02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:05.760]  and another partner, do they want to intermingle their photo libraries? I get it, but I end up
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:11.600]  plugging, or actually these days we use iCloud photo sharing because there is now a way to share
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:17.440]  hundreds of photos with somebody and get them at full quality automatically added to your library.
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:23.120]  You got to do it on iOS, and you got to send it like as a message, you know, with this, this huge
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:26.880]  number of photos, and it sends you a link, and then it adds them to your library. So you can do
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:33.600]  it that way. But it's a manual process to do that. And my wife and I do that, like, we don't have two
[02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:38.480]  libraries, we have one library. So at the end of the year, when we're making the calendar for next
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:46.080]  year, out of photos from the past year, she has to send me the text with 3000 new photos in it.
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:52.400]  And that's what puts it in our master library so that we can have one place where all our photos
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:58.960]  go. So I again, as an opt in, I get that not everybody wants to do it. You could even build in
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:03.120]  if like, if you're really concerned about privacy things, where you take a photo that you don't want
[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:07.440]  your family to see, but they end up seeing it, like, you could make it sync after a day,
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:12.480]  you could make it you could, you know, you could opt out of certain photos, like there,
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:21.280]  there are ways but to say that there's no user need for a family to pull their photos that they
[02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:30.240]  take of their kids is and you know, it's just, it's just, I can't fathom it. I even wonder
[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:36.560]  if what they really want to do, I mentioned kids, I even wonder if what they really dream of doing
[02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:42.240]  is saying, only the pictures of people in the family get shared, or something like that. But
[02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:47.040]  even then, it's like, I've seen their their AI stuff, it doesn't work that great. It misses lots
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:51.680]  of photos, you need to do training. And if you're on vacation, and you take a picture of a sunset,
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:56.720]  that doesn't count. Or do you have to use some sort of algorithm that detects were you present
[02:12:56.720 --> 02:13:01.200]  and they were, it's too much like just give people an option to share their libraries and,
[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:07.280]  and be done with it. Or even if it's even if it's to have a very high level prominent family album,
[02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:12.320]  and okay, your photo role doesn't automatically go in there. And every photo you take doesn't
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:17.040]  automatically go to your whole family. But that it's easy to just take all you know, all the
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:22.160]  recent ones that are relevant and just add them and add them to the family shared library, which
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:27.280]  is a full quality library and iCloud of all those pictures because you can do a shared album, but
[02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:33.600]  they're not full quality. And they have a photo cap. And, and if they're bad, if they're videos,
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:37.680]  and which might be 4k, it might be very large, they're not counting double or triple against
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:42.800]  your storage limit, because you've got a copy, your wife has a copy, your kid has a copy. Exactly.
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:48.880]  It's shared pool. Anyway, I the reason I think these scores are so high is because the fact is,
[02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:54.480]  if you think back to back when dot Mac and mobile me and all that were a joke, like you turn around
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:14:00.640]  10 years later, and Apple's got a lot of services that are really good and solid. And, and they're
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:07.120]  not jokes, they're actually good, even iCloud storage, which I used to avoid, because I didn't
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:12.560]  trust it at all. A lot of my stuff sinks in iCloud now. And I still use Dropbox for most stuff. But a
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:17.760]  lot of my stuff is in iCloud. And it works really well. Not everybody, they have so many services
[02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:21.680]  now too, that there are a lot of comments in the report card that are like, Yeah, I don't use news,
[02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:28.960]  or, but it doesn't matter because I use Apple one for all these other things. And those are,
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:34.720]  those are pretty good. And if you go down the list, like Apple card, Apple pay, fitness plus,
[02:14:35.760 --> 02:14:39.600]  Apple TV, plus Ted, a lot of Ted lasso mentioned some things like that, like,
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:44.480]  it's actually, you know, Apple actually has done a pretty good job with most of its services.
[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:49.040]  They have. And it's, it's one of those things where first impressions matter,
[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:53.840]  and people got the impression that Apple's bad at services, and therefore it sticks, you know,
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:58.640]  it takes a lot longer to break free of that. But I agree, I almost feel like, you know,
[02:14:58.640 --> 02:15:03.200]  to add to your list of headaches for future years of compiling the report card, it might become
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:09.920]  untenable to keep services as one category, because it's, it's, it's getting to be sprawling.
[02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:16.080]  And something like iCloud Drive, which you work with is very different than people saying,
[02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:21.040]  Hey, I love Ted lasso and TV plus is actually accruing a lot of content, but all the Apple
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:26.320]  music app stinks, you know, those playlists on Apple music. I love them, right? Like it's,
[02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:29.760]  it is huge, but then again, it is one of their product lines. So I like the,
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:36.080]  I like the, the fact that it coheres with, with a product line of, of services,
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:42.560]  which also has to wrap all of this stuff in it, Apple care and photos and Apple music,
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:46.640]  all of those things are in here and iCloud storage. And yeah, there was, there was a little
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:51.120]  mini hiccup a couple of weeks ago where a bunch of third party developers were reporting that
[02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:55.760]  there was a part of iCloud that, you know, it was a report stopped sinking. Yeah. And it was like,
[02:15:56.800 --> 02:16:04.720]  the HTTP calls were returning like a 503 services unavailable error. And it, it was a problem and
[02:16:04.720 --> 02:16:08.960]  we should, you know, honestly, Apple's, you know, as the size they are and the importance that
[02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:13.840]  services play in the company that, you know, we should expect near, much closer to perfection
[02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:18.160]  from them. And when they do have problems, we should definitely, that's the bigger problem
[02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:23.440]  that if I had, if I had written about it, the bigger problem isn't that they had a problem.
[02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:27.680]  The biggest problem is that the problem was a total black hole for developers who were
[02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:32.720]  affected by it. Right? So it's hard to say. And their apps get blamed. Right. Their apps get
[02:16:32.720 --> 02:16:38.480]  blamed and you go to Apple's online iCloud dashboard and it's all green lights. And it's
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:44.400]  like, well, then why, how come all these apps I use are getting 503 errors? But the other thing
[02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:48.560]  that struck me though, is that we don't, we don't have issues like this as frequently as we used to
[02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:54.640]  iCloud is, has gotten better. It really has. Yeah. They, nobody's saying they're perfect, but,
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:17:01.280]  but yeah, there was a period in time where Apple and services was just a joke and, and even like,
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:08.560]  um, this had happened after the survey came in, but like, there's an Apple original movie from
[02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:15.680]  Apple TV plus nominated for best picture, right? Like, and one of the best comedy Kota, which is
[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:19.200]  one of my favorite movies of last year too. So I was really happy that it's like, I thought I was
[02:17:19.200 --> 02:17:23.520]  the only one who liked liked it, but they like, they liked me. They really, really liked me. Um,
[02:17:23.520 --> 02:17:30.400]  but, uh, and, and Ted Lasso of course, when the Emmy, uh, for best comedy. And so like Apple TV
[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:35.680]  plus is still a new service and, and, and it's still growing, but, uh, not, uh, certainly what
[02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:42.160]  we could say is not a laughing stock, right? Like they have done a creditable job with that service
[02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:48.240]  and the content that's on it. And that, that is like, I have done fitness plus. Um, when we,
[02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:52.560]  we had a rainy period here, which then ended cause it's California and now it's never going to rain
[02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:58.320]  again. Um, and I was doing bike workouts instead of running. And, um, every time I do that,
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:04.880]  I'm impressed with how good the fitness plus stuff is. So, you know, they, news is still a mess and
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:11.280]  there's issues with Apple music and yes, there are, it's not all perfect, but like their fleet
[02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:16.240]  of services is more impressive than I would ever have imagined. If you had told me Apple was
[02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:20.560]  getting into services, you know, five or 10 years ago. And I also think it's one of the examples of
[02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:25.200]  what I said a couple of minutes ago, that they're best when they're underdogs and all right, maybe
[02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:29.600]  with music, they weren't because iTunes was so big, so early that they should be, you know,
[02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:34.000]  that they've, they've, they've spearheaded, they've been at the forefront of digital music
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:38.560]  and Apple music should be better and software problems and design problems with the apps are
[02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:43.920]  not excusable for Apple. Music aside, everything else that are underdogs, right there, everybody's,
[02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:50.720]  you know, entering a market dominated by Netflix and with HBO and Disney and, and these companies
[02:18:50.720 --> 02:18:56.800]  that are the whole core of the company is making these streaming services, you know, they're
[02:18:56.800 --> 02:19:03.040]  underdogs and I think they're doing pretty well. Yeah, it's so much of the conversation was about
[02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:07.280]  Apple's culture not being a services culture and, you know, culture change takes a long time.
[02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:11.680]  I think it's striking that Tim Cook now says, when we look at a product, we look at what value
[02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:15.760]  we can add at the intersection of hardware, software and services, right? And services is
[02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:19.760]  in there. And I think that's a sign that they have been hammering on the idea that services is a part
[02:19:19.760 --> 02:19:24.640]  of Apple and it's not an afterthought and it's part of what we do. And when you work in services,
[02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:28.320]  you're not working at a lesser part of Apple. You're working at a vitally important and ever
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:35.760]  growing at a rate of like 20 to 30% a quarter service or year over year services business.
[02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:42.320]  And I think it shows, I think it shows that they are no longer an afterthought and it's no longer
[02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:50.720]  the, you know, the dim bulbs that get put over an iCloud. Like, I think it is an area of prestige
[02:19:50.720 --> 02:19:55.520]  for Apple and they have changed the culture. And that's impressive because it is really hard to do,
[02:19:55.520 --> 02:20:01.280]  but I think they've done it. Yeah, I do. I'm going to say that we have covered hardware
[02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:06.640]  and software quality in our discussions of the various platforms. And I'm going to skip to the
[02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:12.720]  bonus round of developer relations, which I knew was going to be, this is not a good year.
[02:20:13.600 --> 02:20:18.080]  Like the social services, social and services or social and environmental or whatever category.
[02:20:18.080 --> 02:20:23.360]  This is also a bit of a Rorschach test, right? Because it was created at a time where developer
[02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:27.920]  relations were really low because people were really angry about arbitrary rejections in the
[02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:34.000]  App Store. And the next year sort of Phil Schiller came in and did a lot of App Store reform and the
[02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:38.720]  scores went up and everybody was feeling better. But, you know, there are always the issues of the
[02:20:38.720 --> 02:20:47.120]  day with developers. And it was all about kind of Apple's court stuff and what they said about
[02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:52.160]  developers in court and their attitude toward App Store fees, offset a little bit by the small
[02:20:52.160 --> 02:20:57.840]  business program, which we sometimes I think loose out of the fact that Apple did say that for, you
[02:20:57.840 --> 02:21:01.520]  know, anybody making less than a million dollars a year on the App Store, that they're only going
[02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:08.400]  to take a 15% cut. And that covers like all indie developers basically, or most indie developers.
[02:21:08.400 --> 02:21:14.480]  So, you know, those two things are at work. But if you look at the comments, like so many people
[02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:20.080]  were just dispirited by the fact that in its legal arguments in cases like the Epic case,
[02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:28.160]  Apple was perceived as basically not finding, not thinking that developers had much value and that
[02:21:28.160 --> 02:21:36.160]  developers really are kind of their morale is really low. Right. It's impossible not to see it
[02:21:36.160 --> 02:21:43.360]  and that it's getting worse because they're not giving anything. And I, you know, it's great for
[02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:48.480]  me and you as pundits because we're going to be able to talk about it. I love listening to you
[02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:52.400]  and Ben talk about it on Dithering. I did that on my run today. In fact, I was listening to you guys
[02:21:52.400 --> 02:21:58.720]  talk about that stream from my Apple watch and it's, yeah, it is the absolutist strategy, right,
[02:21:58.720 --> 02:22:03.360]  that they seem to have, which is like, we're just not going to give an inch. And you keep wondering,
[02:22:03.360 --> 02:22:09.360]  like guys, if you don't give an inch, they're going to really come down hard on you. And I
[02:22:09.360 --> 02:22:13.840]  keep asking myself, like, what do they know that they think is going to save them in the end?
[02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:19.360]  But it's the collateral damage too, of just like, I remember when Apple was on the ropes and the
[02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:23.840]  only thing that kept it alive was that it had users and developers that were going to commit
[02:22:23.840 --> 02:22:28.640]  to staying on the platform. And Apple acts now like they're made men, right? Like they're never
[02:22:28.640 --> 02:22:34.400]  going to need any help from anybody ever. And the problem is that, I don't know, I don't think you
[02:22:34.400 --> 02:22:39.360]  should live like that because everybody's got their ups and downs. And if Apple's down again,
[02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:46.000]  are the developers going to be there who are willing to sort of stand up for Apple after
[02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:50.640]  they've, how they've been treated? I don't know. It's just, maybe they'll never be down and maybe,
[02:22:50.640 --> 02:22:55.440]  maybe it's all, you know, just about the money, but it, I feel like they're going to be in trouble
[02:22:55.440 --> 02:23:02.640]  and nobody's going to bail them out. It's, I feel like they're in trouble because, and, and I know
[02:23:02.640 --> 02:23:08.800]  it often gets, Tim Cook gets slagged as being too financially motivated, right? That all he, you
[02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:12.960]  know, he's not a product person. He never claims to be a product person, but therefore all he sees
[02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:19.200]  is what can be expressed in a spreadsheet. But in some ways, I really do feel like part of that has
[02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:24.320]  to be true with this App Store stuff and that some of the value they could have gotten out of
[02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:32.640]  loosening this stuff, even if they didn't feel they had to, like we don't legally have to change
[02:23:32.640 --> 02:23:39.040]  to 75, 25, just across the board, instead of 70, 30, we'll go to 75, 20. I keep mentioning
[02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:45.440]  that Shiller email that from like 10 years ago, but I'll never stop. It's one of my favorite
[02:23:45.440 --> 02:23:49.280]  things that came out of the Epic lawsuit where he was like, Hey, do we think 70, 30 is going to last
[02:23:49.280 --> 02:23:55.040]  forever? Or, or should we, once we get to like a billion a year, maybe we'll go to 75, 25. And if
[02:23:55.040 --> 02:23:59.760]  it keeps growing eventually 80, 20, I'm just saying, you know, and it's, it's like, I think
[02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:02.400]  he literally said, I'm just saying, you know, something to think about. And somebody said,
[02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:05.920]  are you kidding? We're just going to take all the money. And yeah, you know, they're going to get to
[02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:12.640]  a point potentially where there are laws moving through Congress that are going to just dramatically
[02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:18.320]  potentially dramatically transform their business in bad ways. And no amount of lobbying is going
[02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:23.520]  to be able to turn that. And you think about how much money that they would have had to forgo to
[02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:27.920]  maybe like take the heat off so that there wasn't enough political will. And maybe somebody inside
[02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:31.440]  Apple would say, there's nothing we could have done that would have reduced this to the point
[02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:35.360]  where we wouldn't have been legislated against, but they've made no, as far as I can tell,
[02:24:35.360 --> 02:24:44.240]  other than that the, the small business program, they have made no other moves to mitigate in any
[02:24:44.240 --> 02:24:48.480]  way. And in fact, most of their moves lately are, we will honor the letter of the law, but we are
[02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:52.640]  never going to honor the spirit of the law in what, in what they're doing, because we're just
[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:58.400]  going to try to slow play this thing as much as we can. And the result is that people like James
[02:24:58.400 --> 02:25:03.120]  Thompson say, you know, they have a, you should be grateful. We're letting you make software for our
[02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:09.120]  platforms attitude. And it's really demoralizing. And what's tough about this is James also points
[02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:13.840]  out Apple in developer relations, traditional developer relations actually been doing a really
[02:25:13.840 --> 02:25:19.840]  good job. The virtual WWDCs have been good. They've been, they're virtual, like their tech
[02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:27.600]  talks, their, their virtual lab sessions during WWDC, they have made huge strides in a difficult
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:34.240]  environment to get developers more information and not just the developers who are lucky enough
[02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:39.280]  to come to San Jose every year. And like all of that would normally rocketed up the charts. Like
[02:25:39.280 --> 02:25:46.000]  there are things happening in the developer group and the evangelism group that are so good, but
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:51.760]  they are entirely eclipsed by Apple then going into court and saying, you know, that developers
[02:25:51.760 --> 02:25:58.560]  are lucky to be on our platform. It's undeniable. And I'm sure Tim Cook, if we could patch him in
[02:25:58.560 --> 02:26:02.640]  and finish the show with the three of us, he'd certainly agree. And he would mean it that there
[02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:08.720]  are things you can't put a dollar value on, but I honestly feel that Apple is undervaluing those
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:14.720]  things. And developer relations is one of those things. And it's like, if you're the best player
[02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:20.960]  on the team, pick a sport, you know, Tom Brady, you know, whoever, and you've just thrown four
[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:26.400]  touchdowns in an NFL playoff game, it's like, he's going to say, I want to thank my offensive line.
[02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:33.760]  I want to thank, you know, and say, you know, you, you, you, when you're up, when you're up,
[02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:40.240]  it's, it's to your benefit to, to, you know, to be generous to the people, you know,
[02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:44.880]  says something about you as a person, right? If you are generous to the people you don't need
[02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:49.360]  to be generous to because you're riding high, right? There's, and that's the guy who, the guy
[02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:54.080]  who's a jerk to all those people, when he stumbles and falls, guess what? Nobody's going to help him
[02:26:54.080 --> 02:26:59.680]  up. Like even as he, yeah. Even if Apple is right that they don't need third-party developers as
[02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:06.640]  much as third-party developers think they do, they should go the other way and praise third-party
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:12.320]  developers writing for Apple platforms every step of the way, even if it's more than they think is,
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:17.040]  is due and it's, it would do no harm to them. And there's a dollar value to that, you know, like,
[02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:25.920]  I, what is the Apple logo worth? You can't put a dollar sign on it, right? Like if, if the, the
[02:27:25.920 --> 02:27:31.200]  Sultan of Brunei came to Tim Cook and said, I would like to buy the rights to the Apple logo for
[02:27:31.200 --> 02:27:38.400]  $500 billion. It's, it's a constrained example, but he, he wouldn't sell it, right? It's, it's,
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:42.320]  there is no price tag for it, you know, and if you say, if he named a number and he said,
[02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:47.280]  well, you tell me what the number is. He'd say, it's not for sale. Developer relations are on that,
[02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:53.840]  on that gradient, right? Where you can't really, there is no way to perfectly assess a dollar value
[02:27:53.840 --> 02:27:59.200]  for it, but there, whatever it is worth, it's worth something. It's not a dollar amount and it's,
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:06.640]  it's going downhill. And I feel like this report card year over year, now that we have years of it
[02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:12.880]  under the belt, it it's evidence that it is getting worse. Yeah. And I, sometimes I have
[02:28:12.880 --> 02:28:17.040]  people pop into my mentions on Twitter saying, well, what, what is a fair price then? If it's
[02:28:17.040 --> 02:28:21.760]  not 30, is it 20? Is it 50? It's like, well, it's already 15 for a lot of the smaller developers.
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:26.720]  I really do believe there's a contention at Apple who says, look, everybody's talking about 30%,
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:32.080]  but like 30% is all the big players. Like it's the big players who get 30% and everybody else is
[02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:36.160]  getting 15%. And if you've got a subscription for more than a year, it's 15%. So we're really just
[02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:40.640]  soaking kind of the big game players who are driving huge amounts of revenue through our
[02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:48.320]  in-app purchase system. And we think that that is that class of a transaction. We should scoop more
[02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:53.760]  money out of it because it's just huge amounts of money passing through. And, and that it's a less
[02:28:55.360 --> 02:28:58.800]  sympathetic audience, right? It's a less sympathetic group. It's like, oh,
[02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:03.760]  the poor game developers who are getting people to buy gems in app, like it, that would be a,
[02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:09.600]  another case you could make. But, but there are what, what really blows me away. I know we're,
[02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:13.760]  we're saying a lot of the same things here, which is like, you can't know how much lobbying are
[02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:18.000]  you going to have to spend to get the Senate to kill this bill. That's going to require everybody
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:23.600]  to have access to, to their own app stores on your platform. Like it, there's no way,
[02:29:23.600 --> 02:29:28.000]  even if you could spend the money for lobbyists to get the bill killed, and maybe you could,
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:33.280]  because that's sometimes that's how politics works. I bet you it's more money than you could
[02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:38.240]  have just given away. To invest in things that would make people feel better about you.
[02:29:38.880 --> 02:29:44.880]  And it's not like there aren't advantages to having a more open app store environment
[02:29:44.880 --> 02:29:48.400]  that might come out of it. But like, if I'm from Apple's perspective, I want to keep as
[02:29:48.400 --> 02:29:53.360]  much control as I can. What do I have to give up? The thing that you and Ben have talked about a
[02:29:53.360 --> 02:29:58.800]  little bit, and then I know Marco has talked about on his podcast is this idea too, that
[02:29:58.800 --> 02:30:05.360]  Apple could put a lot more effort into putting its money where its mouth is and in terms of the app
[02:30:05.360 --> 02:30:11.920]  store being patrolled and the scam apps being removed and it being a more, uh, uh, you know,
[02:30:11.920 --> 02:30:16.880]  policed environment and make people feel like they're earning their, their money. But they
[02:30:16.880 --> 02:30:20.880]  haven't done that either, right? Like there, there are lots of PR gestures that they could probably
[02:30:20.880 --> 02:30:27.200]  make to say, see, we really do care. And they aren't making a lot of them and I don't understand
[02:30:27.200 --> 02:30:32.480]  it. Um, and it's, and it's really frustrating. And I start to think I've kind of come around in the
[02:30:32.480 --> 02:30:37.040]  same way of saying, would it be the worst thing if most people just use the app store, but it does
[02:30:37.040 --> 02:30:43.040]  mean that somebody can sell like a, uh, an emulator and it could just run on my iPhone if I wanted to.
[02:30:43.040 --> 02:30:48.160]  And, uh, and there's a little bit of competition so that Apple actually has to kind of keep itself
[02:30:48.160 --> 02:30:52.400]  honest. Cause I agree. I think alternate app stores are never going to be much of a thing
[02:30:52.400 --> 02:30:56.480]  and alternate in app purchase methods. Wouldn't I think Apple would probably compete with them
[02:30:56.480 --> 02:31:03.280]  and win on usability, but wouldn't it be nice for Apple to actually have to try? Cause it does feel
[02:31:03.280 --> 02:31:07.520]  like they're not trying. And it's it wouldn't it be nice if they were trying in a way that just
[02:31:07.520 --> 02:31:11.600]  had few, you know, not more and more people saying, yeah, I actually, I think I've come
[02:31:11.600 --> 02:31:16.400]  around on this. I think mandatory, you know, the, the, the government should mandate side loading
[02:31:16.400 --> 02:31:21.920]  on these platforms. It's, it sounds so, it's, it's a bad idea. Like, but that seems to be
[02:31:21.920 --> 02:31:26.720]  right. Not side loading in and of itself. It's the government mandating it, which I think is
[02:31:26.720 --> 02:31:30.320]  the government coming in and saying you can't, or, or even you, we're going to limit how much
[02:31:30.320 --> 02:31:35.440]  money you can take out of the platform you built, which I, I hate that idea, but Apple has sort of
[02:31:35.440 --> 02:31:42.000]  led with their behavior, led themselves down this path to where this might be a thing. Although I
[02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:45.040]  will throw this out here and I'm going to write a piece about this. So while we're promoting things
[02:31:45.040 --> 02:31:48.400]  that we're going to write in the future, I'll, I'll throw this in there, which is, I do wonder
[02:31:48.400 --> 02:31:54.240]  if the app store would be way better if it didn't, if it wasn't the only source of software on iOS.
[02:31:54.240 --> 02:32:03.520]  And I say that because I wonder if it would free Apple to be more draconian in what it rejects
[02:32:04.080 --> 02:32:10.320]  and say, that's not for us. And it'd be more like a publisher and say, you know, we're not
[02:32:10.320 --> 02:32:14.240]  just released that yourself. We're not going to put it on the app store. And, and if the app
[02:32:14.240 --> 02:32:19.040]  store might end up being like way cleaner. And I do wonder sometimes if the reason there's so
[02:32:19.040 --> 02:32:24.320]  much crap on the app store is because Apple is erring on the side of letting things on,
[02:32:24.320 --> 02:32:29.200]  because if they kill it, it's completely dead and bad PR for them and all of that. Whereas if
[02:32:29.200 --> 02:32:33.040]  they're not the only game in town, they'll be like, ah, you didn't get into the app store,
[02:32:33.040 --> 02:32:37.440]  kid, try again next time, but you can always go over across the street and sell it there and see
[02:32:37.440 --> 02:32:42.880]  if anybody buys it. And, and in the end, the app store might be nicer than that's very
[02:32:42.880 --> 02:32:49.200]  counterintuitive, but I had that thought today that maybe the app store would be more emboldened
[02:32:49.200 --> 02:32:54.640]  to just kick things out of the app store and not allow classes of apps in if it wasn't the only
[02:32:54.640 --> 02:32:57.680]  game in town, because right now that is a lot of pressure, right? Like if you kill something,
[02:32:57.680 --> 02:33:02.880]  it's dead. And so they're inclined to work with the developers and, and maybe they wouldn't have
[02:33:02.880 --> 02:33:08.560]  to do that. Like with the Mac app store, I guess. Well, I know it came up with some of these wordle
[02:33:08.560 --> 02:33:13.600]  clones, you know, but, but some of the ones that weren't ripoffs, not ones that were taking the
[02:33:13.600 --> 02:33:18.080]  name or trying to steal the logo, but just like, oh, it's, it's like wordle, but has a different
[02:33:18.080 --> 02:33:23.120]  name. And some of them, you know, once it came to light, Apple was like rejecting their updates
[02:33:23.120 --> 02:33:27.440]  because they don't want copycat apps. And it's like, you know, if they could just distribute it
[02:33:27.440 --> 02:33:31.040]  on their own, then Apple could say, you know, we don't want anything even vaguely like wordle.
[02:33:31.040 --> 02:33:35.280]  We, we, you know, and, but then your, you know, your work isn't flushed down the toilet.
[02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:40.240]  Cause the other thing too, and there is a financial angle to it, and I don't know if it's
[02:33:40.240 --> 02:33:45.520]  more money or less, but it seems like a better long-term strategy. And what Apple to me is
[02:33:45.520 --> 02:33:51.840]  clearly squandering with their Goodwill with third-party developers is to encourage third-party
[02:33:51.840 --> 02:33:59.520]  developers, large and small, to build Apple specific apps, you know, and, and just fully
[02:33:59.520 --> 02:34:04.320]  embrace the Apple platform. And instead of building something that's cross platform,
[02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:10.240]  fully embrace it and put your engineering resources into using the iCloud stuff for storage.
[02:34:10.240 --> 02:34:14.560]  And then, you know, the privacy story is taken care of because it's on Apple, right? And you
[02:34:14.560 --> 02:34:19.120]  could do like, if I had to, if we had to do Vesper all over again, instead of do, we couldn't use
[02:34:19.120 --> 02:34:23.520]  iCloud at the time. It wasn't, wasn't even close to being good enough. If we were, if I were to
[02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:28.640]  make a notes app now, it would use iCloud to use. And then, and then the privacy story is we, we,
[02:34:28.640 --> 02:34:34.880]  we can't see your notes. And isn't that a great privacy story, but I think more and more at this
[02:34:34.880 --> 02:34:39.280]  point, if, if developers and somebody who was going to do like a small startup or an indie
[02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:43.760]  software house said, I'm going to build entirely on Apple's platforms, people would say you're nuts.
[02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:49.680]  And that's, that is a terrible place to be. Yeah. And the danger of App Store rejection,
[02:34:49.680 --> 02:34:54.560]  I firmly believe this. And again, it's a thing that we can never measure, but the danger of
[02:34:54.560 --> 02:35:02.800]  App Store rejection is not just that I can't install, you know, I can't go somewhere and
[02:35:02.800 --> 02:35:07.600]  just click a button and install dolphin on my iPad and play Nintendo Wii games, right?
[02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:15.920]  It's also how many apps that even that might have been accepted, never got built for Apple's
[02:35:15.920 --> 02:35:25.280]  platforms or for iOS out of the fear that if Apple felt that it was not good for some reason,
[02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:32.400]  it could never be seen by all that work is completely wasted because there's no other way
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:37.680]  onto the platform. And like, that's sort of what I mean by the freeing aspect of it is that's the,
[02:35:37.680 --> 02:35:43.440]  that's where the App Store is today. It is much more the, the it's God, right? It is God for the
[02:35:43.440 --> 02:35:49.280]  app, for the iOS platform and Apple doesn't want to have competing app stores inside loading. And
[02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:53.840]  I get it and I get why they don't want that. But at the same time, I think it's actually bad for
[02:35:53.840 --> 02:36:01.840]  the platform that they don't that, that there's no release valve for somebody who is even wants
[02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:08.400]  to be in the app store, but like hanging over it, the idea that if they say no, you, you can't shop
[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:12.880]  it elsewhere. It's an iOS app. It only works on this platform. I think it's bad. I think it's,
[02:36:12.880 --> 02:36:16.720]  I think it's not, I think we have missed out. I'll put it this way. I think we have missed out on
[02:36:16.720 --> 02:36:21.440]  some amazing apps that might've even changed the world in some way or some part of the world
[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:28.160]  that never made it because the risk was too great. And the truth is, yeah, there's Android, but
[02:36:29.280 --> 02:36:35.040]  most of the great apps in the smartphone era have flowered on iOS and then gone to Android.
[02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:38.400]  And so what app are they're like, let's not build that. Let's build something else.
[02:36:38.400 --> 02:36:42.880]  What, what of those is out there? We'll never know, but I bet you there are some.
[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:47.280]  Right. And if the ID, if the idea for the app, I don't have a specific idea in mind, but if it,
[02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:54.960]  you know, integrates with blank kit and this other kit and something else that all parlay on
[02:36:54.960 --> 02:37:00.000]  the iOS platform, then it is, that's where I was going is that it is a financial benefit to Apple
[02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:04.000]  where Apple can say, Hey, you should get an iPhone because we've got all, look at all this great
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:09.680]  exclusive software that you can get. Right. And it's, you know, it all works with Apple.
[02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:14.720]  And I really it's, it's hard not to see that they, they just lose that, lose that forest
[02:37:14.720 --> 02:37:19.120]  for the tree of Nope. We want 30% of every dollar passing through right now.
[02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:23.200]  Also, let's not forget the Mac app store dynamic a little bit. And I know Mac app store is a little
[02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:27.280]  bit of a joke, although it's gotten better, but like, it's not, it's not the center of attention
[02:37:27.280 --> 02:37:31.280]  that, that the app store is, I would say for, for historical reasons more than it is anything
[02:37:31.280 --> 02:37:35.840]  else. I don't think that the, if iOS had multiple app stores and sideloading was allowed, it would
[02:37:35.840 --> 02:37:38.880]  that the iOS app store would become the Mac app store. I don't think that that's true,
[02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:45.120]  but a thing that you have seen on the Mac app store is Apple go to developers of successful
[02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:51.280]  apps that are outside the Mac app store and said, what do we have to do to get you in the Mac app
[02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:55.840]  store? And that can't happen on iOS. Right. And that's the other piece that I think maybe
[02:37:55.840 --> 02:38:01.280]  that, that the, that the exclusivity of the app store has, has missed on the platform is
[02:38:01.840 --> 02:38:05.600]  if somebody makes something and Apple's like, we'll pass, and then they see it on their platform
[02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:09.520]  and they're like, wait, this is great. Why is it not in our app store? It could lead to some
[02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:14.720]  reflection of like, we should let this in. Like we, this was a mistake on our part. We need to
[02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:20.240]  change our guidelines. We need to change our entitlements in order to let this in because it,
[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:24.640]  now that I've seen it, I realized that we made a mistake here. And right now in iOS, that just,
[02:38:24.640 --> 02:38:30.640]  it doesn't happen because it can't happen. And it just, it's from all we see from the outside,
[02:38:30.640 --> 02:38:33.360]  Apple doesn't even acknowledge that it is, that it could be happening.
[02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:37.920]  Yeah. Right. And so again, it's just, it's an opportunity cost and it's part of the,
[02:38:38.560 --> 02:38:44.080]  this is such a meaty topic. And, and I do think that there's benefit potentially in, in, in
[02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:48.720]  things that could be potentially catastrophic for Apple. They could be good for users. I fear
[02:38:48.720 --> 02:38:53.200]  that the legislation, and I know Ben Thompson feels this way a lot is the legislation will
[02:38:53.200 --> 02:38:58.000]  be badly written and it will actually become bad for consumers. Just like the ebook thing with
[02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:01.840]  Apple was actually bad for consumers because it actually, it, they, they were going to lower
[02:39:01.840 --> 02:39:07.520]  prices and the prices went up. But, uh, I worry about all that. There is some opportunity there,
[02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:13.520]  but I'll just come back to the fact that I'm a little bit still baffled that Apple hasn't been
[02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:17.920]  more aggressive in trying to get the heat off of them. They're acting like they know something we
[02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:22.880]  don't know, and that they're never going to get their business model changed because of this.
[02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:27.520]  And, um, I, I did not expect us to get this far down the path with them still thinking that,
[02:39:27.520 --> 02:39:31.840]  so maybe they do. They're smart. Maybe they've got something in their back pocket, but I, I,
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:37.200]  I'm concerned that they don't and that they're going to end up with a much stricter punishment
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:42.880]  than they could have, that they would have gotten if they had played nice and been nice to everybody
[02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:48.800]  and said, no, no, no, you just misunderstand us. Uh, but they haven't yet. And for a company that
[02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:56.080]  is supposedly on the cusp of releasing VR headset that they presumably want third party developers
[02:39:56.080 --> 02:40:03.280]  to write really cool native apps for, it just seems to me like the overall enthusiasm of people
[02:40:03.280 --> 02:40:10.320]  who aren't currently with an Apple at apple.com employee email address to write software for
[02:40:10.880 --> 02:40:17.120]  a new Apple device is night and day different than when the iPhone came out in 2007 when there
[02:40:17.120 --> 02:40:23.280]  wasn't even an app store and people were dying to write apps for it. Yeah. And, and look, there's
[02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:26.320]  always going to be the argument. I'm sure this is the argument that a lot of people will make
[02:40:26.320 --> 02:40:30.720]  when that platform gets announced is there's money to be made. People will do it because there's
[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:34.480]  money to be made and even apple taking its percentage. It's okay because there's money
[02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:40.080]  to be made and that will motivate people. And my argument back would be, you're absolutely right.
[02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:46.720]  People will come because of the money and there will be a gold rush. However, if you're Apple,
[02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:52.800]  there is Apple cares about money, but Apple also is proud of the art of its platforms and the,
[02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:59.520]  the way its platforms look. And if you've spent a few years turning off the like small,
[02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:06.080]  but creative geniuses who write your software and making them less inclined to embrace your
[02:41:06.080 --> 02:41:10.640]  new platform because you've treated them, they perceive you as treating them badly.
[02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:15.600]  Then what you're going to get is a lot of mercenary stuff from big companies and well
[02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:19.920]  financed people who are like money, money, we can make money on this, but you're going to miss the
[02:41:19.920 --> 02:41:25.360]  stuff that, although it doesn't make you as much money, it's kind of what you put in the ads and
[02:41:25.360 --> 02:41:30.000]  what makes you proud and what makes you show off, like, look at the amazing things that are done
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:35.120]  here. I really believe that that's the value that the indie developer and the small artistic
[02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:39.280]  developer and the people who do things because they really care about Apple's platforms and,
[02:41:39.280 --> 02:41:45.440]  and they want to make good stuff. Like they, they aren't as big financially as some game that's
[02:41:45.440 --> 02:41:49.920]  charging people in at purchases for gems, but they are like what Apple wants to think of its
[02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:55.920]  platforms as being it's like self image. And if you alienate those people, then the stuff you're
[02:41:55.920 --> 02:41:59.520]  going to get on your new platform is not going to be so great. It's going to be fine. It's going to
[02:41:59.520 --> 02:42:05.280]  make money, but it's not going to have maybe some heart and soul that, that make you feel like if
[02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:09.040]  you're Apple make you feel proud of the platform you've built. So I think that's what they're,
[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:14.400]  what they're risking by turning off. These developers, the money will still be there,
[02:42:14.400 --> 02:42:20.400]  but will there be passion there? Right. It's, it's sort of like Steve Jobs is intersection of
[02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:25.520]  the technology and liberal liberal arts. It's actually a six-way intersection and wall street
[02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:30.880]  traffic circle, wall street, wall street runs through there too. And if that's, who's dry,
[02:42:30.880 --> 02:42:36.240]  if that's the motivation that's driving interest in your platform, it is, it's just, you're going
[02:42:36.240 --> 02:42:41.680]  to miss out on the liberal arts part of it and really the technology part because the, you know,
[02:42:41.680 --> 02:42:47.680]  it's, it, yeah, that's enough. Yeah. And I'm not, I'm not, yeah, I'm not saying that there
[02:42:47.680 --> 02:42:51.200]  aren't good apps that are going to be made by companies that are making a financial calculus
[02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:57.120]  on something like a VR headset. I guess what I'm saying is I think that there is this extra level
[02:42:57.120 --> 02:43:00.880]  that you get when you've also got a whole bunch of people who just are really, they love the
[02:43:00.880 --> 02:43:04.720]  platforms and they're committed to being an Apple platforms developer, and they're going to bring
[02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:12.160]  their next big idea to you. And if they're not as inspired, the software in that app store,
[02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:17.840]  the VR app store or whatever it is, is not going to be as inspired. And, um, I think that that is
[02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:25.760]  a, that is a loss that is maybe not as financial, but is, is makes the platform seem lesser and
[02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:30.640]  that's bad financially. And the further you get from a generic platform, like let's say, I mean,
[02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:35.760]  the web is sort of the lingua franca. It's the, you know, tabula rosa, what would you call it?
[02:43:35.760 --> 02:43:39.440]  That's the, you know, it's the one place where everybody can go and write software and it runs
[02:43:39.440 --> 02:43:44.240]  in a big rectangle and it can run on your phone and run anywhere else. And you get to something
[02:43:44.240 --> 02:43:49.600]  like the watch and it's like, well, what does it take for the maker of your favorite podcast app
[02:43:49.600 --> 02:43:55.760]  to make a really good watch app? Well, whatever it is that it takes is all extremely, completely
[02:43:55.760 --> 02:44:01.680]  specific to developing a component to run on Apple watch. You can't use it anywhere else, right?
[02:44:01.680 --> 02:44:07.840]  There's no, you can't even use it on competing smart watch platforms, right? Because Apple watch
[02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:13.040]  is so specific. The VR headsets going to be like that. I think, I mean, obviously there's games
[02:44:13.040 --> 02:44:17.920]  that you could cross plat, you know, but anything else that you're supposed to do in this VR
[02:44:17.920 --> 02:44:22.320]  platform, and I cannot believe that Apple is going to make a VR headset that is only about games.
[02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:28.480]  It's going to be very specific to Apple's headset and you want developers who are committed to,
[02:44:28.480 --> 02:44:33.520]  all right, we'll, we'll commit to doing this effort that is only applicable to your platform.
[02:44:33.520 --> 02:44:39.280]  And we, we trust you, you know, leaving aside the hurt feelings, there is the take a leap with us
[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:45.280]  thing, right? And, and again, maybe there are some companies that are interested in the money
[02:44:45.280 --> 02:44:49.680]  in a future Apple platform, but they're hesitating about it, whether this VR platform is really going
[02:44:49.680 --> 02:44:54.880]  to go or not. And what pushes them over the edge is yeah, but it's Apple like, yeah, we've had
[02:44:54.880 --> 02:44:59.920]  positive things with Apple in the past. Let's do it. Maybe even a little irrationally, let's jump
[02:44:59.920 --> 02:45:06.480]  in because this is, uh, exciting because it's a new Apple platform. And, you know, if you're in
[02:45:06.480 --> 02:45:09.920]  a place where everybody looks at it and it's like, nah, I'll pass. I'll see how it goes.
[02:45:10.480 --> 02:45:14.320]  Uh, your platform is lesser because of it. And that's, I know this is all touchy-feely
[02:45:14.320 --> 02:45:19.440]  intangible stuff, but it's like, I firmly believe there are benefits to Apple having good
[02:45:19.440 --> 02:45:24.320]  relationships with developers that are not just financial transaction based, but that there is a
[02:45:24.320 --> 02:45:29.440]  component that is we're partners. We trust each other. I want to do business with you. I will
[02:45:29.440 --> 02:45:36.800]  follow you where you're going because we've had such good times together. And that part is what
[02:45:36.800 --> 02:45:42.160]  you blow out. If you treat them badly, couldn't say it better myself, Jason, thank you for joining
[02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:47.440]  me. Uh, w w what do we want to mention? We've got a upgrade. You can, you're, you're a podcast
[02:45:47.440 --> 02:45:52.560]  with Mike Hurley. You've got upgrade at relay FM the six colors.com for all the writing and links
[02:45:52.560 --> 02:45:57.840]  to all the podcasts. The incomparable.com has a bunch of pop culture podcasts that I do with a
[02:45:57.840 --> 02:46:02.000]  bunch of other people. Those are the, I think those are the big ones. Well, thank you for
[02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:12.080]  joining me and thanks for our sponsors. We had a trade coffee, Squarespace and, uh, remote,
[02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:28.560]  remote. That's the company where if you are hiring people around the world. So my thanks to them.
