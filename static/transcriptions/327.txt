[00:00.000 --> 00:03.760]  I wanted to have you on because you've been like me,
[00:03.760 --> 00:07.040]  a Mac user, as long as you can remember, probably, right?
[00:08.320 --> 00:13.920]  Yeah, well, I mean, I'm not that old, so I can remember times.
[00:13.920 --> 00:18.960]  You know, I was a little bit late as far as like the Mac, like Apple,
[00:18.960 --> 00:24.400]  quote unquote, faithful. I did not really get into Macs until I was about 16.
[00:24.400 --> 00:31.680]  But it's because I had this like long storied childhood son of a software engineer,
[00:31.680 --> 00:35.120]  very nerdy, explorative software engineer. So I did the whole
[00:36.080 --> 00:43.360]  Amiga, various like Unix systems, all that stuff. And then somebody showed me a Mac and I was like,
[00:43.360 --> 00:50.000]  oh, yeah, it was such a great feeling because to come not from a situation where the Mac was
[00:50.000 --> 00:54.960]  offered to me in any like I wasn't spoon fed the Mac by my parents, by my dad,
[00:55.600 --> 00:59.280]  especially he was like anti Apple and famously came around to Apple.
[00:59.280 --> 01:04.720]  But I really came to the Mac like totally honestly, like on my own,
[01:05.680 --> 01:11.600]  found it said, Yep, this is for me and to come from like a Unix and Amiga background and say,
[01:11.600 --> 01:18.480]  you know what, I want to have this, like, the machine that people say is less powerful is a
[01:18.480 --> 01:25.680]  toy, etc, etc. Something about the the interface, the forgiveness of the Mac interface forgivingness,
[01:25.680 --> 01:32.720]  I guess. I just said this is for me. And I jumped right on about 16, 15, 16 years old. And so now,
[01:33.760 --> 01:38.960]  given my actual age, it's about 30 years ago, so 30 years of the Mac. So I guess that counts
[01:39.520 --> 01:45.360]  as almost as long as I can remember. But that's that's definitely a lot longer than
[01:45.360 --> 01:51.200]  a lot of people. Most people for me, I think I've told this story. I'm sure I have. I mean,
[01:51.200 --> 01:58.080]  we're like this. I just entered in the notes. This is Episode 327 of the podcast. So I'm sure
[01:58.080 --> 02:04.400]  I've told the story before. I mean, she's 326 episodes. I'm sure I've gotten to it. But for me,
[02:04.400 --> 02:10.320]  I'm a little bit I think I'm a little bit older than you. But for me in in my high school years,
[02:10.320 --> 02:19.600]  the Apple two was the shiznit right like and and it was it wasn't that I didn't see that the Mac
[02:19.600 --> 02:30.560]  was I wasn't against it. But I was sort of against the way that the Mac was a level abstracted from
[02:30.560 --> 02:37.200]  the machine, right? Like that the one of the things that people of our age who remember
[02:37.200 --> 02:47.520]  actually like the Apple two being a viable computer is that it it really did put you right
[02:47.520 --> 02:56.880]  at the machine. Right. And it was it was and what I remember very, very specifically was
[02:58.640 --> 03:02.560]  well, I say very specifically, but I don't remember now if it was 11th or 12th grade,
[03:02.560 --> 03:09.280]  but I think I think it was 12th grade. And I had a programming course at my high school.
[03:09.920 --> 03:15.600]  And it was just me and one other kid and they called it like advanced placement programming
[03:15.600 --> 03:24.720]  or whatever. And there was only one Macintosh, but there were several Apple two GS's and I loved
[03:24.720 --> 03:32.960]  the Apple two GS which was sort of the Macintosh inspired version of the Apple two is the you know,
[03:32.960 --> 03:41.760]  the last and greatest Apple two. And there was Macintosh inspired Apple two GS. I think they
[03:41.760 --> 03:50.800]  even just called it the desktop. Do you remember that? Sort of but I was I was an Amiga kid at that
[03:50.800 --> 03:55.280]  time. It's like when you say Apple two GS speaking of all this reminiscence. First thing that comes
[03:55.280 --> 04:04.320]  to mind is Apple to go slow. That's what we would have been. We much like today we would have been
[04:04.320 --> 04:10.160]  we would have been in fisticuffs even even at that age, you know? Yeah, who are you calling slow?
[04:10.160 --> 04:18.400]  Yeah, who are you calling slow? But I remember it and I remember that there was like at the
[04:18.400 --> 04:24.800]  beginning of the school year, it was like, you know, you two are going to just do sort of it
[04:24.800 --> 04:28.720]  was sort of like an independent study, right? Because there's only two kids and and she was
[04:28.720 --> 04:34.480]  a wonderful teacher and and a great, great teacher for computer science. But, you know,
[04:34.480 --> 04:43.680]  with only two kids in the class, it was clearly going to be individual. And I remember that there
[04:43.680 --> 04:51.920]  was it was sort of like who's going to get the Macintosh and who's not. And it settled itself
[04:51.920 --> 04:57.840]  very easily. And it's funny in hindsight that I was like, I don't want to use that thing. It
[04:57.840 --> 05:08.000]  the screen is too small. It's black and white. Right? And a hypercard does not make me it didn't
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.600]  make it was like this seems weird. You know, it's like it's all black and white. I would rather have
[05:13.600 --> 05:20.960]  this thing with the color screen and the it's both color and a bigger screen. And it's it actually is
[05:20.960 --> 05:28.400]  like a computer computer. And it was like, Okay, oh, this is great. This this won't be a contentious
[05:28.400 --> 05:34.080]  issue that we only have one Macintosh in the computer lab. In and in hindsight, of course,
[05:34.080 --> 05:41.120]  I made a terrible mistake. Right? Yeah, it's really interesting to think back that, you know,
[05:41.120 --> 05:47.600]  Apple, I think its whole history has been focusing on some features that matter at the exclusion of
[05:48.160 --> 05:53.040]  features that it, you know, perceives don't matter to its customer base. And when you look back at
[05:53.040 --> 05:59.760]  that very early original Mac, it's like everybody had gotten used to color on their computer screens,
[05:59.760 --> 06:06.480]  you know, if you had a Atari or a Commodore or even an Apple two, you had color, of course,
[06:06.480 --> 06:11.520]  and then to look at this black and white screen, I guess, yeah, you really had to appreciate the
[06:11.520 --> 06:17.280]  things the Mac could do in order to be willing to give up something so kind of taken for granted.
[06:17.280 --> 06:25.200]  And it is funny, too, that at that era, there were so many options available, right? Like you say,
[06:25.200 --> 06:30.880]  you know, you were using an Amiga. I know, our friends at panic, you know,
[06:30.880 --> 06:40.160]  Cable Sasser and Steven Frank were big Amiga users. And the Amiga was incredibly appealing,
[06:40.160 --> 06:46.880]  right? Mm hmm. It was it was cool. There were there were multiple cool computers available.
[06:47.520 --> 06:55.040]  Yeah. The Amiga was so cool that, you know, that the like, raw capabilities of the computer were so,
[06:55.040 --> 07:02.560]  you know, unexpected. There was a whole like scene of they called them just the demos, right?
[07:02.560 --> 07:08.240]  Demo, right? You would just download demos, right? That showed off the amazing, like,
[07:08.240 --> 07:15.360]  coprocessor that did graphics, bleeding and stuff. And that was, you know, I guess that's sort of the
[07:15.360 --> 07:19.600]  opposite of the Mac at that time. Nobody was like, look at what we can do with this, like,
[07:19.600 --> 07:27.200]  video transformation thing. But yeah, it was a very interesting, fun time. I'm really glad I ended
[07:27.200 --> 07:34.480]  up following the Mac. It's funny because I ended up getting into the Mac kind of like on on the
[07:34.480 --> 07:38.880]  precipice of Apple going out of business. Right. So I was like, I was kind of going from like one
[07:40.080 --> 07:46.480]  one like outsider dying, you know, community, the Commodore Amiga, like, well, maybe this other one
[07:46.480 --> 07:51.200]  will work. And then it's like, oh, this one's dying, too. But I ended up, you know, as you know,
[07:51.200 --> 07:55.680]  some some of your listeners know also that I worked at Apple pretty young. And I was there,
[07:55.680 --> 08:01.200]  like, when I guess, you know, it would have been reasonable for us to question whether we'd get
[08:01.200 --> 08:06.320]  our paychecks the next week. It's like, really almost out of business. So it's, it's really
[08:06.320 --> 08:13.760]  gratifying to have ended up following something that I liked because I valued its merits. And then,
[08:13.760 --> 08:20.640]  whoa, what do you know, it's, um, turns out, it's the best and it survived. And it's right now,
[08:20.640 --> 08:26.400]  as we see these new Macs come out, it's like the Macs are definitely the best Macs I've ever seen.
[08:26.960 --> 08:31.920]  And I just can't believe we've we've come here now. It's like such a great time.
[08:31.920 --> 08:38.880]  The demos were, it was such a great word, right? Like sometimes things
[08:38.880 --> 08:45.440]  don't have the right word to describe them. But demos were like the perfect word.
[08:46.080 --> 08:52.080]  I remember being jealous, right that that I didn't have an Amiga to run them because the
[08:52.080 --> 08:58.160]  best demos were definitely on the Amiga. And, and literally it was it was the what we would now call
[08:58.160 --> 09:06.160]  an app. And it would just be like a thing you would launch, and it would run. And it would
[09:06.160 --> 09:15.360]  run. And it would show something really cool on screen. It would be animated, maybe like a 3d
[09:15.360 --> 09:22.800]  type thing or whatever it but just something that looked really cool. And then it would run
[09:22.800 --> 09:28.400]  and then it would end and that was it. And it was the whole point of it, right? The closest the Mac
[09:28.400 --> 09:35.920]  had were screensavers like after dark modules. But they clearly weren't as cool and there were
[09:35.920 --> 09:41.760]  there was definitely something to that where the Amiga had, you know, capabilities that that other
[09:41.760 --> 09:47.840]  computers didn't have. Yeah, for sure. It was stuff. You know, I mentioned it earlier that the
[09:47.840 --> 09:53.840]  specific chip the Amiga had was called a I think it was the graphics coprocessor and someone called
[09:53.840 --> 10:01.120]  it the copper chip, right. And it was so renowned within the whole demo scene that like I think you
[10:01.120 --> 10:06.880]  would see, you know, like the word copper like floating across the screen. And it was a very like
[10:06.880 --> 10:13.440]  hackery kind of culture. It was like, all the people who were hacking and cracking the games
[10:13.440 --> 10:18.960]  that you would download pirated or copy wouldn't download them, you copy the disk, disk duplication
[10:18.960 --> 10:27.280]  parties. We didn't call it piracy at the time. No, it was just getting stopped. But all the it's
[10:27.280 --> 10:33.200]  like the same people who were smart enough and like adventurous enough to disassemble and reverse
[10:33.200 --> 10:37.840]  engineer all these copy protection schemes were like the same people who were making these
[10:37.840 --> 10:42.720]  incredible graphics. It's funny because they're there. The skill set if I think back at is probably
[10:42.720 --> 10:48.240]  the same people also, who were being robbed by the piracy. Yeah, probably also working at the
[10:48.240 --> 10:54.000]  game companies. But yeah, it's a it was really something else. Yeah, anybody who could make
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.720]  a demo that would get any attention, let alone any, you know, like actual renown clearly had
[11:01.440 --> 11:07.520]  programming capabilities that either either they were working for a game company or they
[11:07.520 --> 11:14.080]  should have been right. Totally. Let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor. It is
[11:14.080 --> 11:23.440]  sanity.io. Back in 2015, the team that became sanity was commissioned to make the website of
[11:23.440 --> 11:30.400]  one of the most famous architects in the world, the Office of Metropolitan Architecture. They
[11:30.400 --> 11:40.000]  wanted to build a website that not only displayed the work of the architects, but also showed
[11:40.560 --> 11:46.080]  buildings as living things in the world. They wanted to build a front page that automatically
[11:46.080 --> 11:51.680]  rebuilt itself every 30 minutes based on algorithms that grouped relevant content
[11:51.680 --> 11:58.320]  together. And but without adding a lot of maintenance on the people on the other side
[11:58.320 --> 12:03.360]  of the website, the people who developed it, they wanted a site that worked as well for visitors
[12:03.360 --> 12:10.480]  as for the institution itself. And they wanted to structure content in a way that could be used
[12:10.480 --> 12:16.800]  for their in house book publishing as well as their website. There was no system that would
[12:16.800 --> 12:23.200]  let them treat content as data while providing a clean and unbloated user interface for people
[12:23.200 --> 12:31.440]  who spend all their time working with the actual content. So they made sanity the first platform
[12:31.440 --> 12:40.240]  for structured content. Sanity gives you a hosted real time back end for structured content and an
[12:40.240 --> 12:48.320]  open source editing experience that you can configure and customize using only front end
[12:48.320 --> 12:53.680]  skills. It comes with excellent tooling, great documentation, a vibrant community where you can
[12:53.680 --> 13:01.040]  get help, get inspired. And there's a reason it is rated as the content system with the highest
[13:01.040 --> 13:09.920]  satisfaction by web developers. It is truly great. And if you're nerdy enough to consider yourself
[13:09.920 --> 13:16.640]  a web developer, it is truly a great system. And if you're just a user who wants something that you
[13:16.640 --> 13:21.600]  can create, it's great. It takes less than 10 minutes to get up and running and you can have
[13:21.600 --> 13:32.640]  your content behind a robust and globally scalable API in no time. Sanity.io now delivers over 9
[13:32.640 --> 13:39.200]  billion, that is right, 9 billion API requests every month for multinational companies. You can
[13:39.200 --> 13:45.760]  use it for free for low scale projects. It is pay as you go if you need more API usage and they
[13:45.760 --> 13:53.120]  offer great plans for larger teams and larger businesses. Try Sanity for free by going to

[14:11.840 --> 14:15.440]  Are you using the new MacBook Pro right now as we speak?
[14:16.240 --> 14:18.320]  I am using the hell out of the new MacBook Pro.
[14:21.520 --> 14:27.440]  That is the theme of this episode. And the longer we've gone, the long, you know,
[14:27.440 --> 14:33.040]  we were going to record yesterday and you know, blah, blah, blah. The more I go,
[14:33.040 --> 14:37.760]  the more impressed I am by this machine. I love it. I absolutely love it.
[14:38.480 --> 14:43.200]  Me too. And it's, I mean, I'm really glad that, you know, actually not only yesterday,
[14:43.200 --> 14:49.760]  but you first got in touch with me a few days ago. I had the MacBook sitting there on my desk,
[14:49.760 --> 14:56.720]  stuck in migration assistant. And I was like, ah, you know, I'd love to be on the show,
[14:56.720 --> 15:01.120]  but it's going to be like three hours of me complaining about the migration assistant.
[15:02.640 --> 15:08.000]  Or lying and saying that, you know, or just talking about how beautiful the outside of
[15:08.000 --> 15:17.360]  the machine is. And the only interface you've seen is the dot dot dot progress bar of a migration
[15:17.360 --> 15:21.200]  that hasn't completed yet. It's the most beautiful hang I've ever seen.
[15:22.400 --> 15:28.560]  So I had real bad luck and picking up from like the vibe on Twitter around our, you know,
[15:28.560 --> 15:33.440]  Slack groups and stuff like that. I'm not the only one. I think, unfortunately,
[15:33.440 --> 15:38.960]  this is a beautiful, magnificent new series of Macs that for some reason,
[15:39.680 --> 15:45.520]  people are having more trouble than usual with migration. And my advice to anybody who still
[15:45.520 --> 15:49.200]  is waiting for theirs, just just bite the bullet when you get this thing.
[15:50.000 --> 15:56.320]  I don't know if it's like, you know, that it has like a slightly less new OS or what. But if I were
[15:56.320 --> 16:02.800]  doing it over, I would first things first, plug it in, go into recovery assistant on the on the
[16:02.800 --> 16:08.160]  new Mac, which you do these days by just holding down the power key as you start it up and just
[16:08.160 --> 16:14.320]  reinstall, just like go in, you know, reinstall the OS from scratch. Apple will take care of it.
[16:14.320 --> 16:19.120]  They'll download the latest version. I don't know for sure that that would have spared me the
[16:19.120 --> 16:25.760]  hassle I went through, but I ended up there anyway after so much grief. So I would recommend just try
[16:25.760 --> 16:31.760]  that, you know, until and unless everyone stops complaining about migration failing.
[16:32.960 --> 16:37.520]  So that was going to be a horrible episode. We were going to record.
[16:37.520 --> 16:46.880]  But now, like you say, every day gets more interesting. And as I'm speaking to you now,
[16:46.880 --> 16:56.080]  I am staring into the beautiful to my eyes, gigantic abyss of a 24 inch LG monitor
[16:57.120 --> 17:06.960]  that is the first monitor I've had in probably 10 years. And I'll tell you why. Because I went
[17:06.960 --> 17:13.680]  for the 14 inch MacBook and and you feel like that's not enough screen space to have as your
[17:13.680 --> 17:19.760]  total desktop. Yeah. And it's one of those things. I know, you know, I know you have vision issues.
[17:19.760 --> 17:26.000]  My vision issues are different, but also changing as I get older. And I'm looking at this 14 inch
[17:26.000 --> 17:31.680]  MacBook and it's beautiful. And I, to be honest, I can get by without an external monitor,
[17:31.680 --> 17:41.680]  but I probably would have just swam in this thing like a fish as a 20 year old and now as a 46 year
[17:41.680 --> 17:47.200]  old. I am. I got it. And I was like, you know what? I think I made the right choice, but
[17:47.920 --> 17:54.080]  something's not right about this. It's not it's not good in the day to day use. So I use my MacBook
[17:54.080 --> 18:00.560]  mostly at my desk in my office. So I just like between the time you and I first started and I
[18:00.560 --> 18:06.560]  was stuck on migration assistant. So much has changed. I like Google. I started Googling. It's
[18:06.560 --> 18:12.560]  like being a grandparent in the 80s trying to figure out how to buy a VCR. Right. You know,
[18:12.560 --> 18:17.840]  I'm like, how do you monitor? And I'm like, I don't know what any of these expressions mean.
[18:17.840 --> 18:24.240]  Like it's all like HDI, you know, whatever. I don't know. It's it's letters that I don't know.
[18:24.240 --> 18:30.320]  So, you know, chatting with some people who know better than I do, kind of doing some Googling.
[18:30.320 --> 18:37.600]  I came to the conclusion that getting an LG ultra fine is a good starting point for me anyway,
[18:38.400 --> 18:45.200]  because you can get a screen that's pretty good and it's all based around Mac infrastructure.
[18:45.200 --> 18:50.480]  So it's like it assumes you're going to plug a Mac into it. Right. So now I'm like I said,
[18:50.480 --> 18:59.520]  I am really I I'm in a better mood to that. I've been in a long time because I am sitting here
[18:59.520 --> 19:09.280]  talking to you with a new MacBook Pro 14 inch plugged in with a single cable to my LG monitor.
[19:09.920 --> 19:15.120]  And it's in clamshell mode. It's closed. I plugged it in. I didn't even have to open the lid,
[19:15.120 --> 19:21.280]  plugged it in. Screen comes on. I'm I'm off to the races. My MacBook is charging.
[19:21.280 --> 19:27.840]  It has ethernet coming in. It has video going out. It has all of my peripherals.
[19:27.840 --> 19:34.800]  I'm just like I'm like the grandpa from the 80s who just discovered like actually VCRs are really cool.
[19:34.800 --> 19:41.680]  Or like automatic transmissions are cool, right? Like I just I just hit the gas pedal and the car goes, you know?
[19:41.680 --> 19:50.880]  Yeah. And also, it's been 10 plus years since I've looked at a screen
[19:51.680 --> 19:58.640]  that is larger than a 16 inch MacBook Pro. So I'm I'm just like, I'm really glad I didn't get
[19:58.640 --> 20:05.360]  anything bigger than 24 inches because it's huge. It's it isn't it's an interesting place to start
[20:05.360 --> 20:18.880]  because it it is arguably, maybe inarguably, right? The the hole in Apple's offerings is the
[20:20.480 --> 20:33.120]  the Apple, what what is the Apple standalone, big ass display? That doesn't cost $5,000. Right? Yeah.
[20:33.120 --> 20:43.440]  With an optional $1,000 stand. Right. And, again, the the it's not even just about the cost,
[20:43.440 --> 20:51.200]  you know that that the pro display XDR is is five slash $6,000. You know, with the stand and
[20:51.200 --> 20:59.200]  whatever it it's it's that the pro display costs that much because it has certain features that
[20:59.200 --> 21:08.240]  do not apply to even if you have great eyesight, truly great, you know, perfect vision. It it has
[21:08.240 --> 21:14.080]  features, though, that don't really matter to you unless you're in the professional video editing
[21:14.080 --> 21:23.760]  field and need that level of of I don't even know what you call it. But it's like all the all the
[21:23.760 --> 21:31.840]  all the reference monitor, right reference monitor type stuff. It's like, like, let's just say let's
[21:31.840 --> 21:40.720]  just set set the bullet point like, and say $1,500. Right? Let's just say what if Apple made
[21:40.720 --> 21:48.400]  a $1,500 display, which would be more expensive than almost every third party display on the
[21:48.400 --> 21:54.320]  market, you know, dollar for dollar, it would still be expensive, there, there would be plenty of margin
[21:54.320 --> 22:02.320]  in there. Clearly, they could make it right or to not put a dollar point on it. It just to say,
[22:02.880 --> 22:11.760]  what if they just made a display that was like the 27 inch iMac? Right? Yeah. Why not? Why just
[22:11.760 --> 22:19.520]  just sell me a display. And you and I know this because we're on a, you know, group slack. And it
[22:19.520 --> 22:28.800]  it I hear it from daring fireball readers all the time. People who would would buy an iMac the
[22:28.800 --> 22:35.840]  entire iMac just to use as an external display. Yeah. But they can't because it doesn't. It
[22:35.840 --> 22:40.720]  doesn't the IMAX don't support target mode anymore. But people are you know that that is
[22:40.720 --> 22:47.120]  something people are willing to pay for. They're like, I would buy the entire iMac, you know,
[22:47.840 --> 22:57.440]  whatever it costs, and just use it as a display from my MacBook Pro or whatever that you know,
[22:57.440 --> 23:06.880]  they want to plug into it. The L and maybe Apple's answer is just, you know, hey, listen to us. You
[23:06.880 --> 23:13.600]  know, we partnered with LG several years ago that that's our answer. Our answer is the LG 4k.
[23:14.560 --> 23:19.840]  Yeah, well, or 5k right 5k though, here's the funny thing. So I'm so out of it. And I don't I
[23:19.840 --> 23:23.920]  didn't understand I just kind of fell for the group think a little bit like everyone keeps
[23:23.920 --> 23:30.480]  saying, you know, the LG 5k is the best thing until Apple comes out with something that of
[23:30.480 --> 23:34.800]  their own that is like comparable. And I was just kind of thinking, well, I guess that's the thing
[23:34.800 --> 23:40.000]  I need to wait for is the whatever. And now I'm looking at this map, the monitor I got
[23:40.880 --> 23:46.320]  for like 700 bucks, which is not cheap for a 24 inch monitor. I've come to learn.
[23:48.880 --> 23:56.400]  I have no idea. I didn't either. No. And but it's perfect. I don't need anything else. And
[23:56.400 --> 24:00.320]  it turns out like I was just kind of going along for the ride with everybody saying like, well,
[24:00.320 --> 24:07.440]  it's too bad. In fact, like the the I'm looking at it right now the the bezel is like a nice,
[24:07.440 --> 24:14.400]  like smooth subdued kind of charcoal. The LG logo is very modest. I don't know. I'm like,
[24:14.400 --> 24:18.640]  I'm not I'm not I don't have a problem with this. I am in good position.
[24:18.640 --> 24:25.200]  Well, and I that that is kind of what I think maybe, you know, nobody at Apple, you know,
[24:25.200 --> 24:31.600]  Greg Joswiak has not texted me and said, Hey, groups, you know, groups, that's what he always
[24:31.600 --> 24:40.560]  calls you. He should, you know, the LG, that's the answer, you know, we worked with him on it.
[24:40.560 --> 24:48.480]  But it's like, I have heard that and and it's popped up a lot in the last 10 days or so as
[24:48.480 --> 24:55.520]  people have started getting their MacBook, their new MacBook Pros, right? Because there's a huge
[24:55.520 --> 25:02.080]  number of people and I'm sure that a lot of them are the type of people who listen to my podcast.
[25:02.080 --> 25:08.480]  So they're listening right now. People who probably just like you, right? Like, and you're
[25:08.480 --> 25:16.080]  probably thinking like a year ago, like, maybe I should buy the M1 MacBook Pro, but I know it's
[25:16.080 --> 25:23.360]  kind of not the pro pro MacBook Pro. So I should wait. And they didn't know is it going to be three
[25:23.360 --> 25:30.080]  months, six months? Is it going to be a whole year turned out it was a whole year. But they're all
[25:30.080 --> 25:36.000]  like, Oh, it was worth the wait. This this machine has everything. But the other thing is that
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.640]  they're the type of people who might want to plug it into a display and and I've seen people talking
[25:40.640 --> 25:50.720]  about it. And more or less the the answer from people who own the LG 5k thing is, hey, it's not
[25:50.720 --> 25:57.920]  perfect, but it's actually pretty good. And a lot of the problems people had early on were addressed
[25:57.920 --> 26:05.440]  by like the B B revision version of it. And you know, that there wasn't there like a thing with
[26:05.440 --> 26:10.240]  like the shielding or something like that, like, he couldn't use some equipment, right?
[26:10.240 --> 26:14.640]  Some equipment next to your monitor or something. Right. I remember that. Yeah,
[26:14.640 --> 26:20.080]  yeah, it was like the there was like a shielding issue and like it would screw up your Wi Fi or,
[26:20.080 --> 26:25.440]  or something like that. But that's all fixed. And and now it's like, you know, this is actually,
[26:25.440 --> 26:33.120]  you know, a reasonable price. And it's, you know, it's more expensive than most 24 inch displays,
[26:33.120 --> 26:44.400]  but it's also less expensive than an Apple branded 24 inch display would be. And it it is intended,
[26:44.400 --> 26:48.560]  like you said, you know, the assumption is you're going to plug this into a Mac.
[26:49.600 --> 26:54.560]  Right. And that's a beautiful I had no idea this was even technologically like where things had
[26:54.560 --> 27:02.400]  gotten. Right. Like I was really skeptical when I plugged in the one USB or not not USB Thunderbolt
[27:02.400 --> 27:08.480]  three cable, which looks like a USB cable. When I plug that one cable in, I was really skeptical
[27:08.480 --> 27:14.000]  that it was going to be able to charge my Mac and bring all the peripherals in and put out the video
[27:14.000 --> 27:21.440]  signal. And the fact that it just works. I feel like I dodged a bullet not buying a more mainstream,
[27:22.240 --> 27:30.240]  you know, HDMI based monitor. I feel like this is I had no idea last week when I was still waiting
[27:30.240 --> 27:36.720]  to get the MacBook, I had no idea that the week would unfold in such a way that I'd end up with
[27:36.720 --> 27:44.240]  a monitor. And I would end up with a much easier setup for like docking and undocking my work
[27:44.240 --> 27:50.240]  workplace. So explain that to me, though, like, like, like, when you dock and undock,
[27:50.240 --> 27:55.280]  what do you what do you how many things do you have to plug in? One? One thing?
[27:55.280 --> 28:01.120]  Oh, it's the back. It's lit. I'm looking at that's why I'm so enthusiastic. That gives you
[28:01.120 --> 28:07.040]  it gives you power and puts the puts the display on the external display. We should be doing an
[28:07.040 --> 28:13.440]  infomercial. Tell me. No, it can't blend. It can't play into a tin can and banana.
[28:14.960 --> 28:20.640]  And then and then smoothly slice a tomato, right? It even makes Julian fries.
[28:20.640 --> 28:31.680]  No, yeah, but seriously, you I can't actually tell if you are playing. No, I'm not. I'm honestly
[28:31.680 --> 28:37.360]  not because I'm I'm you're like me. You're like me. You don't know. I'm much like you
[28:37.360 --> 28:44.800]  where I honestly have gotten out of touch with the clamshell the state of the art with clamshell.
[28:44.800 --> 28:52.480]  Yeah, docked into a monitor. So honest to God, I'm being so I'm being completely
[28:53.200 --> 28:57.520]  straightforward here. I am not playing dumb. Yeah, let me explain it then for you and for
[28:57.520 --> 29:01.440]  everybody else in the audience who's like us who had no idea this was the reality.
[29:02.400 --> 29:10.000]  We live in my have the LG monitor plugged into power strip. And then into that,
[29:10.000 --> 29:15.280]  I have my MacBook Pro plugged in with the USB or the sorry, the Thunderbolt three cable.
[29:16.880 --> 29:26.160]  Now, in addition, the monitor has an extra Thunderbolt three and like three USB C ports.
[29:27.680 --> 29:33.200]  As it happens, the way I was living before was I have one of these adapters that lets you get
[29:33.200 --> 29:40.080]  ethernet and USB C and some other things. I have like a chain of USB hubs right now. I have like
[29:40.080 --> 29:50.240]  a USB hub plugged into the USB C hub that also brings ethernet. And all of this stuff is as
[29:50.240 --> 29:56.720]  aggregating a mouse keyboard scanner, ethernet connection, some other junk like some chart,
[29:56.720 --> 30:05.520]  you know, the cord that my phone plugs into all this junk is going into one USB C port on the
[30:05.520 --> 30:12.560]  monitor. And all of that is magically conveyed to my Mac. Hmm. And I don't do anything you didn't
[30:12.560 --> 30:19.760]  have to do anything. Do you need you it needs to be a special cable though, right? Like Thunderbolt
[30:19.760 --> 30:24.640]  cable, it needs to be a Thunderbolt three cable. This is also something I learned in the last few
[30:24.640 --> 30:28.560]  than the last few weeks or, you know, I think I started thinking about it when I was doing my
[30:28.560 --> 30:33.200]  migration assistant. I was like, like so many people before me, I'm sure like, well, maybe a
[30:33.200 --> 30:38.960]  regular USB cable would work, you know, got to give it a try. And it doesn't work. And I didn't
[30:38.960 --> 30:45.120]  have I didn't have a USB C, or I'm sorry, a Thunderbolt three cable. So I just did it with
[30:45.120 --> 30:53.760]  ethernet. And that was okay. But to LG's credit, this is I guess, as much as Apple helped them,
[30:53.760 --> 31:01.760]  Apple didn't help them in the cable withholding department. Because the LG monitor came with
[31:01.760 --> 31:08.640]  a Thunderbolt three cable. So out of the box, I plug it in. Oh, this is terrible. This is such
[31:08.640 --> 31:14.160]  a great story. Keep going. I plug it into the wall, I plug it into my Mac, and I can't believe
[31:14.160 --> 31:21.920]  it. Oh, like I said, I had to plug my existing mishmash of USB hubs into the monitor. And
[31:21.920 --> 31:25.680]  suddenly it's I mean, I'm recording on this. Actually, that's another device I didn't mention
[31:25.680 --> 31:34.400]  I'm recording on this with a Rode podcaster USB mic plugged into this mishmash. It's like the knee
[31:34.400 --> 31:42.080]  bones connected to the to the leg bone. You know, I got the road plugged into a USB A hub that's
[31:42.080 --> 31:48.800]  plugged into the ethernet USB C hub that's plugged into the monitor, which is connected to the MacBook
[31:48.800 --> 31:56.160]  Pro 14 inch in one max with a single cable and you are hearing my voice in the midst of all this
[32:00.240 --> 32:03.120]  doesn't get any better than that. Now you can see why I'm in such a good mood.
[32:03.120 --> 32:06.160]  Yeah, you really you really do seem like you're in a great mood.
[32:06.160 --> 32:08.400]  You've never heard me. You've never heard me so bright.
[32:08.400 --> 32:12.560]  I've known you. We've known each other for 15 years or something 20 years
[32:12.560 --> 32:20.000]  easily. And and you've never been in a better mood. I'm just giddy. I'm giddy with madness.
[32:21.680 --> 32:30.880]  Isn't that though that that kind of is like the honestly going back to when we were young,
[32:30.880 --> 32:40.560]  and that Amiga demo era, the thing that Mac had was the it just works factor. And
[32:40.560 --> 32:46.960]  if you were technically inclined on the PC side, or the Amiga side, or whatever other side,
[32:46.960 --> 32:53.760]  you might say, I don't care about it just works. I'll figure it out. I don't care if it's a little
[32:53.760 --> 33:01.040]  hard. I just want the better thing. But there it's true, though, right? Like, like what you're
[33:01.040 --> 33:08.720]  describing is is in it just works factor that's like, okay, as as long as you have the right
[33:08.720 --> 33:18.560]  Thunderbolt cable. Yep. And and you can argue about I personally would argue that Thunderbolt
[33:18.560 --> 33:28.160]  the whole USB C story is a sort of a mess that these things can plug, they all have the same
[33:28.160 --> 33:34.800]  plug. And they can therefore plug into anything. But you don't know if it's the right plug,
[33:34.800 --> 33:41.440]  plug, you know, and and you and I have been talking you you talked about your migration
[33:41.440 --> 33:48.480]  assistant prevails, you know, over the last few days, we have a friend who also got one who
[33:49.440 --> 33:56.240]  had a bad experience with the with the migration assistant. I had a terrible experience with
[33:56.240 --> 34:07.120]  migration assistant with a review MacBook. I can't remember if it was my m one last year,
[34:07.120 --> 34:13.920]  you know that that I got from Apple as the review unit or if it was the one before but it doesn't
[34:13.920 --> 34:20.560]  really matter. The gist of it is, I thought I had a Thunderbolt cable. And I was trying to do
[34:20.560 --> 34:27.040]  a Thunderbolt from old machine to new machine. And it was telling me that it was going to take
[34:27.040 --> 34:32.960]  like 17 days, I don't know, it was like, ridiculous. And I'm like, what the hell I can't,
[34:33.600 --> 34:40.560]  you know, I, I don't have that much time, you know, I can't let this run. And it turned out
[34:40.560 --> 34:46.640]  that it was just what I thought was a Thunderbolt cable, because it was thick, it will actually
[34:46.640 --> 34:53.360]  wasn't, it was just a stupid, too thick USB-C cable. And that made all the difference. And
[34:53.920 --> 35:01.200]  when I went through my box of crazy cables and got one that actually I knew was Thunderbolt,
[35:01.200 --> 35:07.520]  then the migration assistant took like, an hour and 10 minutes, and it was boom, and it was done.
[35:07.520 --> 35:16.080]  And, but that's kind of crazy, right? Like that in, in the history of computing, it's totally
[35:16.080 --> 35:24.880]  nuts that you have the exact same connector. And one of them is it not just like a little
[35:24.880 --> 35:29.040]  bit better. It is like totally different and different universe better.
[35:29.760 --> 35:34.880]  Right. I still can't get over the fact that so much is happening through this one cable.
[35:34.880 --> 35:40.960]  Right. And then and then on the other hand, like you said, it would take 17 days to transfer a Mac
[35:40.960 --> 35:46.560]  through the same interface. And it's kind of like, it reminds me of, you know, another thing
[35:46.560 --> 35:52.640]  that I've like, just decided to never get good at is figuring out all of the different, I think
[35:52.640 --> 36:00.480]  they're called micro USB or mini USB or all of those little trapezoidal, microscopic things.
[36:00.480 --> 36:06.560]  And for some reason, they never get the one that fits. Nope, no, at least like you're saying,
[36:06.560 --> 36:11.120]  at least when it fits, you know, it's the right one. And you finally get one that fits in there,
[36:11.120 --> 36:13.520]  you're like, well, I don't know what the hell this thing is called, but it fits.
[36:14.240 --> 36:21.360]  You know, HDMI has gotten the same way, right? Where HDMI has has become this thing where there
[36:21.360 --> 36:31.360]  are many, many versions of it now. And they all have the same plug. But if you don't have the
[36:31.360 --> 36:41.200]  right cable that supports the right HDMI standard, you can't do XYZ. So just a total tangent, but
[36:41.200 --> 36:48.080]  like our home entertainment system, we have one TV in our living room, we and we only ever use
[36:48.080 --> 36:56.080]  two things to input to it, we have a TiVo, which gets our cable. And we have Apple TV.
[36:57.040 --> 37:06.080]  And we can use the TV's remote to switch those inputs. But you can mostly like so the Apple TV
[37:06.080 --> 37:14.240]  can turn off the Apple TV remote can turn off the TV, but it won't turn on the TV. And I'm 100%
[37:14.240 --> 37:22.320]  certain it's because the HDMI cable isn't right. And it's it what, what a pain in the ass, I would
[37:22.320 --> 37:31.760]  so much prefer if every single revision to the HDMI spec had an incompatible dongle, you know,
[37:31.760 --> 37:36.160]  so that I would know if I have the right one, right? Like, oh, it doesn't even plug in,
[37:36.160 --> 37:41.200]  then I know that I don't have the right cable. Yeah, it's funny. Speaking of the migration,
[37:41.200 --> 37:46.960]  my make my migration took a little longer than I expected, because of a similar, very comparable
[37:46.960 --> 37:53.680]  problem with Ethernet, which is same plug, totally different capacity, right? The whole like,
[37:53.680 --> 37:59.840]  is it a cat five? Oh, my God. Yeah, right. Right. That's a nightmare. It's so and you have to look,
[37:59.840 --> 38:05.120]  speaking of vision, you have to look at this like very fuzzy type, like printed on the sheathing of
[38:05.120 --> 38:10.240]  the cable and hope that you can find something that says cat five or cat six. And then at it,
[38:10.240 --> 38:17.440]  at some instances, I have found misprint cables claim to be one and then aren't. And you can't
[38:17.440 --> 38:21.680]  tell because like the the computer doesn't like light up and say, woohoo, we got a cat six or
[38:21.680 --> 38:29.440]  whatever. It just is slower. And so I have it on my back of my mind to like eradicate cat five
[38:29.440 --> 38:34.560]  cables from my house. Because I will inevitably get one and think like, this is going to be great,
[38:34.560 --> 38:41.920]  I'm going to do the fastest file transfer I've ever done. And then it's, you know, a slow one.
[38:41.920 --> 38:46.960]  I'm going to tell you, I think I've again, I think I've told this story on the podcast before,
[38:46.960 --> 38:58.320]  but we bought this house like five years ago. And I before we bought it, I said I would like cat six
[38:58.320 --> 39:05.200]  Ethernet to every room and and they showed me on the blueprint, you know, here's where the
[39:05.840 --> 39:11.600]  Ethernet ports will be. For the most part, it was like, yep, fine, fine, fine. It's like,
[39:11.600 --> 39:16.640]  you know what, this would be a good room to put to can we can we do one here and there, you know,
[39:16.640 --> 39:20.560]  and they're like, Sure, sure. And you know, and but for the most part, you know, it was all good.
[39:20.560 --> 39:28.000]  And then we walk through the house. And I look and I see them. And I'm like that they're they
[39:28.000 --> 39:34.320]  all look good. But I didn't test them, of course. Right. Which, of course, is that that's the rookie
[39:34.320 --> 39:41.440]  move, right? Like when you when you buy a house, you have to test everything like test every spigot
[39:41.440 --> 39:47.760]  flush every toilet, take it, take a take a dump in every toilet, right? Take a while.
[39:47.760 --> 39:55.200]  Right. But it's true, though. You've got to take a shower in every shower isn't up to spec.
[39:57.120 --> 40:06.400]  Guess what? Every single one of them was it the house actually was wired for cat six. So
[40:07.040 --> 40:13.360]  that's not where I'm going. It was. But every single one of them was a phone port.
[40:13.360 --> 40:21.840]  Oh, no, not an ethernet port. So like, the first time I tried to plug something in,
[40:23.040 --> 40:28.240]  I I'm like, What the hell is this? And I'm like, Oh, my God, they're,
[40:28.240 --> 40:34.960]  they're phone jacks. And talk about feeling old, right? Because like, who even needs
[40:36.960 --> 40:41.600]  20 phone jacks around their house? Like, they took one look at you. They were like,
[40:41.600 --> 40:48.560]  this guy needs some analog phones. That's
[40:50.960 --> 40:56.480]  but it literally was as easy, you know, which was a lot of jacks around the house,
[40:56.480 --> 41:01.680]  but literally just replacing them with ethernet jacks, fix it, you know, and that was it. But
[41:02.240 --> 41:06.480]  I mean, how would a normal person deal with that? Right? Right. Because
[41:07.040 --> 41:10.160]  and be honest, john, how many are still phone jacks right now?
[41:10.160 --> 41:17.680]  Oh, no, I know what I did. I did. I did the smartest thing possible, which was,
[41:18.880 --> 41:23.760]  I paid somebody to replace all of them all of them. Okay. And so instead of like,
[41:24.640 --> 41:30.720]  because you know me well, the way I would have done it was to go to the, you know, like the one
[41:30.720 --> 41:37.840]  by the Apple TV and the one by where I'm going to put my computer in my office to do work.
[41:37.840 --> 41:43.520]  I'll fix these two and leave the rest. No, I instead I paid somebody to come in.
[41:44.160 --> 41:50.080]  And we because we had other stuff, smart home type integration stuff. And I'm like, can you guys
[41:50.080 --> 41:53.680]  do you guys and I explained the problem to them and like, Oh, we could fix that. And I'm like,
[41:53.680 --> 41:58.160]  Oh, my God, will you please just go through this house and fix every one of them? Because the other
[41:58.160 --> 42:09.360]  the side B of the problem is down here in my podcast cave basement, is where our data closet
[42:09.360 --> 42:18.320]  is. And that's where our cable comes in to the house. And the other thing was that all of those,
[42:18.320 --> 42:25.520]  I think I seriously think it's about 2025 cables from around the house. They were all unlabeled.
[42:25.520 --> 42:34.800]  Oh, yeah. And again, not the sort of thing that I anticipated. And I would have if I had known,
[42:34.800 --> 42:40.240]  I would have complained vociferously and said, I'm not I'm not taking ownership of the house
[42:40.800 --> 42:48.800]  until you label them. Instead, I found out about this after we had purchased the house.
[42:48.800 --> 42:52.560]  But I was like, the other thing is these and I was like, come down here. I was like,
[42:52.560 --> 43:00.720]  take a look at this. And it was just this, you know, it's not just one octopus. It's like
[43:01.360 --> 43:10.560]  three octopuses together. Yeah, 24 things, and they're all unlabeled. They're all blue.
[43:10.560 --> 43:16.000]  There's no difference in the color. And I'm like, Can you label this? And they did like the most
[43:16.000 --> 43:22.800]  amazing labeling job. You know what I mean? Like, now it's like the Library of Congress where it is
[43:22.800 --> 43:32.960]  like, third floor guest room, front, blah, blah, blah, you know, and it's like, Oh, this is I,
[43:32.960 --> 43:36.800]  I'm never going to use this ethernet cable. But I'm so glad it's later. So glad you know which
[43:36.800 --> 43:42.720]  one it is. I'm so glad. It's probably the kind of thing where if you are not you or I was just
[43:42.720 --> 43:47.920]  fixing it ourselves, like just putting in our own port, we would just do it and plug in a computer
[43:47.920 --> 43:53.520]  and if it works great, but like they probably are professional enough that they like did a line test
[43:53.520 --> 43:58.400]  or something. No, yes, they did. They did. So then at that point, it's no big deal for them to also
[43:58.400 --> 44:02.960]  to just like pop on a label because they're testing it. They know they're at both ends.
[44:02.960 --> 44:07.680]  Yeah, but why didn't the people who installed it in the first place? Right? Maybe it has
[44:07.680 --> 44:15.040]  something to do with the fact that they put phone jacks. Maybe, maybe that was a clue. Maybe, maybe.
[44:15.040 --> 44:20.160]  All right, let me take a break here. And thank our next sponsor. It is Mack Weldon. Oh my god,
[44:20.160 --> 44:26.160]  I'm wearing like seven pieces of Mack Weldon clothing right now. It is my favorite brand.
[44:26.160 --> 44:32.000]  I swear, even if they stopped sponsoring the show, I would not stop wearing their clothes. They're
[44:32.000 --> 44:38.960]  fantastic. They have what they call the daily wear system and it's a selection of clothes
[44:38.960 --> 44:46.080]  rooted in smart design made with performance fabrics built to work together. That's words
[44:46.080 --> 44:52.080]  from them. What I'm telling you is that you go to Mack Weldon and I'm telling you, what you see is
[44:52.080 --> 44:57.600]  what you get. You're like, oh, that looks like a great hoodie. I'm telling you, it is a great hoodie.
[44:57.600 --> 45:04.640]  It is absolutely terrific. But they've got everything from t-shirts to polos, socks,
[45:04.640 --> 45:10.960]  underwear, button ups, shorts, underwear, everything, everything you can want. Mack
[45:10.960 --> 45:18.400]  Weldon makes it easy to dress for work, leisure, and play. I hesitate to say this because I
[45:18.400 --> 45:26.240]  actually need to buy more. I'm telling you right now, their slippers are the greatest slippers
[45:26.240 --> 45:37.440]  of all time because it's like the right combination of sort of being fundamentally
[45:37.440 --> 45:41.760]  slipperish, where it's like you're wearing a slipper and it's very comfortable, keeps your
[45:41.760 --> 45:50.160]  feet warm. My feet get very cold if I don't have something on, but has like a hard enough sole,
[45:50.160 --> 45:58.000]  like a rubber bottom, where it's more structured than just wearing, let's say, like a thick sock.
[45:58.000 --> 46:04.640]  I love the slippers. Last time I emphasized the slippers, they sold out of them instantly.
[46:04.640 --> 46:11.040]  Terrible, terrible disaster because I actually, at the time, needed to buy more
[46:11.040 --> 46:17.760]  because I wear the ones that I have every single day. And I'm telling you, you could say,
[46:17.760 --> 46:26.400]  what, they wear out? Are they flimsy? No, it's not that they wear out because they're flimsy.
[46:26.400 --> 46:31.200]  I wear them out because I wear them every day. I'm telling you, they're the greatest slippers
[46:31.200 --> 46:36.640]  you can ever find. I love them, but they have everything. Even if you don't even need slippers,
[46:36.640 --> 46:42.080]  if you're like, I've never needed a slipper in my life, I'm telling you, they've got hoodies,
[46:42.080 --> 46:50.640]  they've got hoodies, t-shirts, underwear, socks, pants, everything you need. I really love their
[46:50.640 --> 47:02.320]  stuff. It's really great. You can get 20% off your first order by going to Mac Weldon, M-A-C-K-W-E-L-D-O-N,

[47:21.760 --> 47:28.960]  show, promo code the talk show. Get the slippers. I'm telling you, if you have any interest in
[47:28.960 --> 47:34.960]  slippers, get them before other people who listen to the show a week late sell them out.
[47:35.600 --> 47:40.800]  I think I need to get my order in because it turns out I had this on my list last year for a
[47:40.800 --> 47:49.760]  Christmas, like a wishlist. You can cheat because the show will not come out for a day, right?
[47:50.320 --> 47:54.720]  I can cheat, but I have to either just buy them for myself right now, which I probably should,
[47:54.720 --> 48:02.960]  or I have to try to get the mechanics of gift hints going fast. But yeah, these look great,
[48:02.960 --> 48:08.160]  and I've had it on my list. So one of these years, I'm going to get one of them.
[48:08.160 --> 48:12.400]  I'm telling you right now, Daniel, I'm telling you, get the slippers right now.
[48:12.400 --> 48:16.240]  All right, all right, all right. Let's talk about the new MacBook Pro.
[48:17.600 --> 48:22.880]  I don't know what order to talk about stuff. I don't know if this is a stupid gimmick or not,
[48:22.880 --> 48:32.880]  but I'm thinking let's just go top left to bottom right, right? And let's talk about
[48:33.440 --> 48:43.040]  the actual display. And there's the rounded corners in the top left and top right.
[48:43.040 --> 48:53.040]  There are square corners at the bottom. And if you had told me that at some point,
[48:53.040 --> 49:02.160]  I would have thought that rings untrue to me, like either all four corners should be rounded
[49:02.960 --> 49:10.240]  or none should be rounded. But in actual practice, I actually love it.
[49:10.240 --> 49:15.200]  But I'm curious what you think about the rounded corners.
[49:15.200 --> 49:20.960]  It really it hasn't bothered me at all. And something kind of curious I noticed the other
[49:20.960 --> 49:24.880]  day, somebody actually brought it to my attention. Anybody who's lucky enough to have one of these
[49:24.880 --> 49:31.040]  things already can try this out. If you haven't, the rounded corner at the top actually blocks the
[49:31.040 --> 49:36.320]  mouse. Yes. So if you go up there, you can't it's kind of weird because like you can go behind
[49:36.320 --> 49:44.400]  the notch, right? But yeah, it's a pointless like accommodation, but it's kind of fun that
[49:45.040 --> 49:50.720]  you can't even go there. But it doesn't bother me. It's like, you know, the the shape, it looks
[49:50.720 --> 49:54.240]  good. I'm looking at it right. So I actually, you started talking about this, I popped open my
[49:54.800 --> 50:01.600]  clamshell so I can look at the look at the beautiful screen. And yeah, I think I'm totally
[50:01.600 --> 50:07.680]  happy with that. It doesn't doesn't demand symmetry. You know, it would be we it would
[50:07.680 --> 50:11.840]  it would be horrible if like the left was rounded and the right was right, right.
[50:14.240 --> 50:25.520]  To me, it works because the the actual screen corner is so close to the actual physical corner
[50:25.520 --> 50:32.480]  that it it it has to be rounded, right? It almost like it's so the the bezel is so small
[50:33.120 --> 50:42.880]  that if it weren't rounded, it would actually have to be further from the corner. You know?
[50:42.880 --> 50:48.480]  Yeah, well, it would look it would look awkward. It would make like what I'm looking at it now and
[50:48.480 --> 50:53.680]  whatever the, you know, whatever the radius of the curve, right to my to my eye anyway,
[50:53.680 --> 51:00.880]  it exactly matches or very closely matches the radius of the case. So yes, makes it makes the
[51:00.880 --> 51:08.720]  bezel have a sort of continuity, as if it's as if it's a bent strip. And if it were to come to a
[51:08.720 --> 51:13.920]  point there, it would look clumsy. And if I look at the bottom, the same issue doesn't apply,
[51:13.920 --> 51:19.680]  because there's all that extra space at the bottom. And also because the case of the keyboard,
[51:19.680 --> 51:25.360]  part of the MacBook blocks the vision of the of the rounded corner of the bottom, right?
[51:26.400 --> 51:34.080]  There's in the old days, and and I actually think it's relevant. It's not just
[51:35.440 --> 51:44.000]  a trip down memory lane. But I do think it's relevant that, like the original 1980s era
[51:44.000 --> 51:52.640]  max had rounded corners. But they were done in software, right? And that's what you're talking
[51:52.640 --> 52:00.720]  about where you could actually put the arrow cursor up into the corner beyond the round
[52:00.720 --> 52:09.360]  wrecked boundary of the screen display. And famously, that would be like how you would
[52:09.360 --> 52:14.560]  invoke the screen saver, right? Like if you had after dark or whatever your screen saver was,
[52:14.560 --> 52:23.440]  you know, and you you might have it set to, hey, if I put my mouse in the absolute top right
[52:23.440 --> 52:29.920]  corner, that trigger the screen saver, and then you could walk away from your computer, and you'd
[52:29.920 --> 52:36.240]  know the display wouldn't burn in, which, again, is sort of an old thing to be worried about.
[52:36.240 --> 52:44.800]  So to be worried about, but but you could see the mouse, the arrow go into that region, whereas now
[52:44.800 --> 52:52.960]  it's actually like you said, it's literally like a hard boundary, even in software, that and mouse
[52:52.960 --> 52:59.680]  is prevented from going up there, like as you run the mouse pointer into the corners at the top,
[52:59.680 --> 53:07.040]  either side of the top, even in software, it's a hard boundary. Yeah, this is a really dangerous
[53:07.040 --> 53:12.160]  topic. I'm really glad I don't have the top corners of my Mac set to like sleep or shut down.
[53:12.880 --> 53:17.440]  While we're recording the show, I'm realizing I can't just go willy nilly into every corner.
[53:17.440 --> 53:23.840]  And now that I'm looking at the menu bar actually on, I have one visual while we're still talking
[53:23.840 --> 53:30.480]  about the top of the MacBook Pro, I have one visual gripe, which is, I think, the taller menu
[53:30.480 --> 53:38.960]  bar and the relatively small font size of the menus, it looks a little wrong to me like I think
[53:38.960 --> 53:45.360]  these menu titles are some kind of swimming in an ocean of, of menu bar. So that's my gripe,
[53:45.360 --> 53:51.120]  I had to have one, one bad mood reaction. Right. And that looks like it can obviously fix that in
[53:51.120 --> 53:55.840]  software if they want to. But that's, if I look back at my external monitor now, it's like the
[53:55.840 --> 54:03.520]  proportions of the font to the menu bar are right in the, in the, you know, the fallback non,
[54:04.400 --> 54:13.760]  non notch situation. I wonder about that, because they, they, there, there was a rumor that somehow
[54:13.760 --> 54:22.160]  broke out, like just days before the announcement event that there might be a notch. And it's sort
[54:22.160 --> 54:27.760]  of the way rumors happen, where the closer you get to the event, the more people know about it,
[54:27.760 --> 54:35.120]  and the more likely something is to leak. But clearly, for as long as Apple has been working
[54:35.120 --> 54:41.360]  on this, they've more or less kept it under wraps, right? Because the rumor of a notch
[54:41.360 --> 54:49.200]  literally only came out like 72 hours before the event. I and I don't blame Apple, I know that's
[54:49.200 --> 54:55.760]  what Apple likes to do. They like to announce things and have as many things that could be
[54:55.760 --> 55:02.880]  surprising, be genuine surprises to everybody. But I can't help but think, though, that that by
[55:02.880 --> 55:12.240]  keeping it under wraps, that they it may be more eyeballs on it would have gotten a better
[55:13.120 --> 55:19.360]  proportion of font size to menu bar height. Ordinarily, it's the sort of thing that I might
[55:19.360 --> 55:26.000]  have very specific notes on and say, like, I just think what you should do is instead of setting the
[55:26.000 --> 55:33.760]  instead of setting the menus in 16 point San Francisco, make them 18 point, you know, or
[55:33.760 --> 55:39.280]  something like that. I don't even know if that's the answer. But there is something to that where
[55:41.040 --> 55:48.480]  they look like you said swimming to me. And when you when you select them, like you go to the edit
[55:48.480 --> 55:59.600]  menu, it the highlighted edit looks just slightly it's disconnected. Yeah. From the menu. It's
[55:59.600 --> 56:04.400]  there. Actually, instead of instead of bringing the highlight, like if you click on a regular menu
[56:04.400 --> 56:11.120]  bar item, the highlight of the menu item kind of almost goes flush to the menu that appears below
[56:11.120 --> 56:18.400]  it. In fact, it's just like a one pixel, right? separation. And on the MacBook Pro with the with a
[56:18.400 --> 56:24.480]  notch, it's like a good, I guess, like maybe six pixels or something, I don't know, six points.
[56:25.920 --> 56:29.360]  And it looks a little weird, but it doesn't look like I and so that was one of the things I noticed
[56:29.360 --> 56:33.760]  and it looks weird, but it doesn't look like I'm going to go on a rant weird, you know, it just
[56:33.760 --> 56:38.800]  right inside, I'll get used to it. And here's an example where they could have easily made a mistake
[56:38.800 --> 56:45.440]  where you and I would have gone on a rant, which is, thankfully, when you go and you click at the
[56:45.440 --> 56:52.160]  very, very top of the screen, say above the Edit icon, right, right, right. It activates, right.
[56:52.160 --> 56:56.640]  So you can't miss this is the whole Fitz law thing, right? Like you could you go up to the
[56:56.640 --> 57:02.880]  maximum height of your screen, click, you get a menu. And it's a little weird that you get a menu
[57:02.880 --> 57:09.680]  whose edit like menu button title is highlighted below the point where you clicked. But that's a
[57:09.680 --> 57:16.560]  little weird, like conceptually, but it's perfect usability wise, right? The arrow cursor is
[57:16.560 --> 57:24.560]  actually above the highlighted area of the selected menu. Yep. Yeah. The I, you know,
[57:24.560 --> 57:32.960]  we have to talk about the notch, right? I mean, I'm fine with it overall. Yep. And I even predicted
[57:32.960 --> 57:44.880]  it. It's it's a stupid it, you know, me well enough to know that. Like, why? Why? Why would
[57:44.880 --> 57:52.800]  I write my prediction post two hours before the event? You know, it's stupid. But I like to do
[57:52.800 --> 57:59.840]  that. I just want to put my money on the table more or less. And you're all you're always one
[57:59.840 --> 58:07.680]  for a bad bet. Yeah. That's that is that it literally that is like my it's on my birth
[58:07.680 --> 58:16.800]  certificate. It's my middle name always down for a bad bet. John. I was mostly right. And
[58:16.800 --> 58:23.360]  hey, the one thing I was wrong about is like this, this last minute weekend rumor of a notch,
[58:23.360 --> 58:29.680]  no way. And I, you know, I put that in writing. And of course, you know, turns out there is a
[58:29.680 --> 58:41.680]  notch. Yeah. But in practice, it's fine, you know, and it's fine, because it it the screen
[58:41.680 --> 58:49.520]  really is so close to the borders, that there almost has to be something, you know, to it's
[58:49.520 --> 58:55.760]  exactly like the iPhone notch where it's like, you know, I guess in theory, you know, maybe someday
[58:55.760 --> 59:06.160]  Apple will come up with some technology to shoot these cameras through the display. But barring
[59:06.160 --> 59:13.520]  such technology, you either have to have a notch or you have to have a bezel that runs the entire
[59:13.520 --> 59:21.120]  width of the display. And I think that the on the Mac even more than the iPhone, it actually makes
[59:21.120 --> 59:28.160]  a lot of sense because the it's almost a celebration of the menu bar, right, which is
[59:28.160 --> 59:36.400]  sort of like this weird hallmark of the Mac user interface, right, that there's this thing at the
[59:37.040 --> 59:43.200]  top of the display, it's always there. It doesn't matter which app you're in, there's going to be a
[59:43.200 --> 59:49.840]  menu bar, it's going to be like, you know, 20 pixels or 24 pixels now or whatever, you know,
[59:49.840 --> 59:56.240]  size it is, at the top of the display, it's sort of the hallmark of the Mac user interface.
[59:56.240 --> 01:00:02.960]  And on the Mac, the notch, even though it interrupts the menu bar, it is sort of a
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:08.640]  celebration of the menu bar, because it's like, the whole reason it kind of works
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:18.800]  on the these new MacBook Pros is that, well, it's not like, oh, a couple of apps, you know,
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:26.240]  you have a menu bar at the top of the screen, and therefore it you know, the the notch is just
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:33.360]  interrupting that. No, it's every app. So there's like a reason for it to be there. And the basic
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:44.640]  idea that the region under the menu bar is still a 16 to 10 aspect ratio area, it actually is is
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:53.600]  more, it's it's sort of cements the menu bar, right? As like a permanent fixture. And and I
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:01:01.120]  love the menu bar. So I I'm down with it. Yeah. And I was I was thinking as you were talking that,
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:05.680]  I think the concern, the first concern that comes to people's mind is, is this thing going to
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:11.760]  distract me? Yes. Yes. What people thought with the iPhone too. Yep. And as I was thinking about
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:18.720]  that, I sort of realized we've been conditioned for the entire history of the Mac to not be
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:24.400]  distracted by the menu bar. Right? It's always been there. It's always been irrelevant to the
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:33.120]  task to the specific task at hand, like you're focused on writing or illustrating something or
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:38.400]  chatting with somebody or browsing the web. And you go to the menu bar when you need to do
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:44.720]  something. But it's there. It's persistent. And we are so trained to ignore it that I think it's
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:53.760]  ridiculous to think to imagine that an relatively unobtrusive black rectangle in the menu bar is
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:02:01.920]  going to meaningfully distract anybody. Do you know? Do you remember to revisit our when we
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:08.160]  first started using the Mac discussion? Were you a system six user? Or did you start in the
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:16.080]  system seven era? System seven? Yes. Yeah. So the one of the controversies with system seven
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:25.200]  and was that they made the Apple logo color. Oh, huh. And in system six, and earlier because they
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:32.320]  were mostly focused on black and white displays, the Apple menu was black, which is just black,
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:40.160]  which it has been in the whole Mac OS 10 era. But when system seven came out, they made the
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:46.960]  Apple menu color. And the whole argument was, oh my God, now there's this six color thing up in
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:50.880]  the top left corner. It's going to distract everybody. And it was like, no, it's actually
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:57.600]  fine. It's fine. Right? Yeah. Yeah. I think that's it. We're focused and trained to pay
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:03.360]  attention to, like you said, the rectangle beneath it. So really what it comes down to,
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:09.760]  are there compromises and trade-offs with the notch? Yes. But I think they are mechanical
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:20.080]  compromises. In particular, what happens when... It's nobody's idea of a great outcome that either
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:25.680]  of these things happens. One, that the text menus on the left side of the notch end up jumping over
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:31.440]  and leaving a gap between where the notch was. It's not aesthetic. It's not great. And then
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:39.120]  even worse, maybe people didn't test this enough inside Apple category is the fact that the status
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:49.200]  items just disappear underneath the notch. So regular menu items are the ones that go
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:56.800]  from the Apple menu to the app name, file, edit, view, blah, blah, blah, left to right.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:04.640]  And the status items are the ones, the little icons for... And what are the ones that people
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:10.800]  use from Apple? There's like the battery one and... Yeah. I got a bunch of them up here. I got
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:19.360]  Wi-Fi. Sound, right? Sound, yep. Go ahead. Well, there's a couple of Apple ones,
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:26.960]  but for the most part, if you just run with the software that comes from Apple, you don't have a
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:37.600]  lot, but a lot of third-party apps run in the menu bar, right? Dropbox and, geez, I can't even name
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:45.120]  all the ones I have, but there's tons of them, right? And I'm sure people who listen to the show
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:50.080]  have tons and tons of third... But that's what we're talking about. The status menu
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:05:01.840]  items are the ones that go from top right and go to the left. And they meet in the middle,
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:11.920]  right? The menu bar items... And there's always been an ability to have an app that has so many
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:23.440]  menu items. And as a nerdy power user, you can have so many status menu apps that they collide.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:30.640]  And something has to give, right? Even without the notch. Yeah. In fact, any developer
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:36.720]  probably typically runs into this with Xcode. It's like Xcode has a ton of menu items, and developers
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:42.080]  might be more likely to have little fiddly menu extras. But yeah, they do collide, and you just
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:52.880]  have to accept that you lose some menu extras. Right. And again, to go down memory lane,
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:06:02.160]  arguably, maybe... There used to be the thing called the control strip, which was sort of the
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:09.200]  touch bar before there was a touch bar. But on the classic Mac OS, a lot of the things that we now
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:17.680]  run in the menu bar would be control strip items, right? And arguably, maybe there should be
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:26.080]  something, a place other than the menu bar for those items, and that third parties could feel
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:37.840]  unrestricted about adding to, because it wouldn't be as limited in space. But where we wound up,
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:44.720]  maybe it's better to be simpler and just say, there's one menu bar, and on the left side,
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:51.040]  on the left side, it's the apps menu items, and on the right side, it's these system-wide things.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:58.480]  But the notch makes it more complicated, because it takes, especially on the 14-inch side,
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:09.840]  takes precious pixels away from the middle. Yeah. It's like I said, there is a cost to it,
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:15.120]  it is a compromise, but it's just so... Maybe partly also just because the computer is so great,
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:20.160]  I just don't care. It's like, who cares? Really, I'll get around. I'll get it. I'll get by.
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:30.000]  Yeah, I feel the same way. And I'm not one not to complain if something annoys me, but it really is
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:36.960]  the truth that one day in, I was like... For one day, I was like, this notch is really weird,
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:42.880]  and it's really crazy the way the mouse just disappears underneath it. Xcode is a perfect
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:52.560]  example, but there's a couple of apps that have enough menu items that it expands past that 50-yard
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:57.040]  line, for lack of a better term. You get used to it. It's fine. You get used to it. And I think
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:03.840]  on the latest ATP, I think it was Marco who pleaded with their audience, because there's
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:08.400]  already these utilities, I guess, you can install to try to, quote unquote, I don't know, what do
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:14.000]  they do, but make things, quote unquote, back to normal. And he was just like, please just try it
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.440]  out. Don't go out of your way to try to fix this problem if it's not going to be a problem. And I
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:23.120]  don't know what kind of compromises people are going to try to do. I didn't even look at what
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:28.640]  those utilities do. But people have whined about it and said, well, they should at least let us
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:32.080]  just put the whole screen underneath the notch. And I'm looking at my screen and I'm thinking,
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:40.240]  that would just be so bad. That would be, to intentionally impose extra bezel space on your
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:47.520]  Mac, it just seems like a bad idea. The only thing I could see being on the table for Apple
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:58.960]  to do at a system level would be to, and clearly in their current world, all of these settings,
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:05.920]  no matter which platform you're on, they put under accessibility. Accessibility is where
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:12.720]  the actual features that you need for accessibility go, but it's also where
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:21.760]  UI tweaks go. Things that you don't really, you can't even say it's an accessibility thing. It's
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:29.600]  sort of a taste thing. I could see them putting in accessibility a thing to always treat the menu
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:36.160]  bar as black so that you don't need, like I linked to a thing on Daring Fireball called Top Notch.
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:44.320]  It's a free utility that basically it makes the menu bar black by always putting a black strip
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:50.320]  at the top of your desktop picture, whatever your desktop picture is. And again, I linked to it
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:56.240]  because I think it's clever and it's well done. But even when I linked to it, I said the same
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:03.040]  thing the ATP guys or Marco did where it's like, honestly, this is interesting. I want to let you
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:09.520]  know about it, but if you get one of these, you should actually try living with it for a week
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:15.200]  before you even install it. Because I think it's going to disappear for you. But I could sort of
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:23.840]  see Apple adding an option to say always make the menu bar black and done, right? Maybe I should
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:29.840]  take a break and thank our third sponsor here. Oh, I love this company. Squarespace. Oh my God.
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:36.960]  Do I love Squarespace? Not just because they sponsor the show regularly, but because it is
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:47.520]  just a fantastic place to go to host your website and everything you want to do with hosting a
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:54.320]  website. You can do a Squarespace. You can register a domain name. You can select a template
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:11:01.440]  like a style. You can edit it. You can add features. You drag and drop. It's all WYSIWYG
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:08.160]  as you go. Once you launch your website, how do you update it? You go through Squarespace. It is
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:14.320]  a CMS. It has analytics. You can see how many people are visiting your website,
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:22.560]  where they're coming from. All of it you can do at Squarespace. And again, I say it all the time,
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:29.440]  but it really is my best advice for this is that I know that the sort of people who listen to my
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:36.640]  show are the sort of people who friends come to when they need a website. And they come to you,
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:40.960]  and they're like, what do I do? I need a website. Send them to Squarespace. I'm telling you,
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:48.240]  it'll get them out of your hair. It'll free them to do all the creative stuff they want to do
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:55.040]  on their own without needing to know HTML or CSS or JavaScript or knowing what the hell the
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:03.760]  difference is between HTML, CSS, JavaScript are. They don't even have to know. They just
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:09.680]  drag and drop the stuff. It all just works. Send them to Squarespace. It'll be so great.
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:15.440]  It'll get them out of your hair, and they'll be so happy. Go to squarespace.com

[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:54.080]  We were talking about the menu bar. I happened to just see while I was sitting there looking
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:58.560]  at my screen, I saw this little defect that I sent you on iMessage. I don't know if you
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:04.720]  have this too. It's like the audio input indicator. Yeah. I have the same thing.
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:07.360]  Odd for you. That's a growing pain. That's okay.
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:15.760]  Yeah. I think that, again, I think it's sort of a side effect of wanting to keep it secret,
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:26.000]  right? I mean, wouldn't you almost be more surprised if macOS, I'm guessing like 12.2,
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:35.360]  doesn't have a bunch of features that sort of smarten up the way anything that goes into menu
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:40.880]  bar behaves around it. But one of the most interesting parts about this design, though,
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:49.360]  like with the iPhone, it's like any phone, including those running Android, could have
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:57.520]  a notch, and they could do something to dance around the notch and separate stuff on the left
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:06.960]  and right. But for a desktop computer, it actually is perfectly suited to the Mac because of the menu
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:16.400]  bar. Whereas like a Windows PC, it would be very difficult to, in my opinion, to have a notch
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:23.200]  without operating system support, right? Yeah. I didn't think about that. Yeah. Just
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:29.680]  the coincidence that the menu bar has always been on the top compared to the start or whatever.
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:38.960]  Right. Which is at the bottom. Right. I don't know that it makes it more likely that Apple
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:51.680]  would have pursued this design for the hardware, but maybe it did. I don't know.
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:57.280]  It's like the alternate universe where the Mac menu bar was always at the bottom,
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:08.880]  like the start menu or something like that. It seems so foreign to me that it's hard to
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:19.920]  take it seriously. I don't know. It's like file, edit, view, etc. They feel like they should be at
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:24.240]  the top of the screen. And I don't know if that's because they really should be at the top of the
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:29.360]  screen or that it's so indoctrinated in me that they are at the top of the screen.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:36.240]  I think there's something natural to it in the same way that if you go back to the metaphors
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:42.960]  that informed the Mac, like a filing cabinet, you would find it weird if the label for a
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:50.800]  drawer was all the way at the bottom. Yeah, I do think that's exactly right.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:57.120]  There's sort of a meet-me-at-the-most-natural-I level for the executive-level stuff.
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:03.200]  But yeah, it certainly did work out. I think you're right. It's really interesting to imagine
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:12.160]  how they would have accommodated this. If Apple were bottom-oriented in the screen for their menu
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:19.840]  bar, I don't know, would the notch go at the bottom? Could that work? I don't think it would
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:25.520]  make good videos for people having all these upshots. Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:33.440]  Yeah. You could even imagine now that maybe they could fix it with machine learning and adjust the
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:39.440]  angle. So even if the camera were at the bottom, it would somehow fake it to make it seem like it
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:43.200]  was at a more flattering angle. The nose hair filter.
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.360]  Wouldn't you love to work on that feature? Yeah.
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:58.320]  Well, so we've gotten all the way to the menu bar going from top to bottom.
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:10.880]  Right. Well, the other angle, the rest of the MacBook Pro is basically the performance.
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:21.040]  And it brings the show full circle to what we were talking about when we were kids.
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:31.280]  Where it's like, what is the actual computer? And it's so fun, right?
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:39.600]  It is so fun. I don't think you're trying to gloss over any of the other qualities of the hardware.
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:47.040]  But just to say, it is the performance, but it's also the celebrated return of things like MagSafe
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:53.840]  and the ports. I was musing about the idea, what if the timeline of Apple switching to its own
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:18:01.040]  architecture for the M1 series Macs happened to coincide with the timeline where they were still
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:06.720]  stuck in keyboard hell? And then we would have had the first of these amazing high performance
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:13.120]  Macs that happened to have these cruddy keyboards that nobody liked. And so it all just came together
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:23.360]  at a time when I think this keyboard is even better than the previous, the latest Intel MacBook
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:29.920]  Pros. Somehow I think it has like a tiny little bit of like ticky tacky, that whatever that
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:37.440]  clickiness that ultimately proved to be too loud about the butterfly keyboards. It just has,
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:43.120]  I feel like a tiny bit of that, but it's still just effortless for me to type on it. So I think
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:48.480]  that's great. I think that looking at it right now, I think the decision to make the black
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:56.800]  background on the keyboard sort of makes it aesthetically look nice. Overall, from a hardware
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:01.600]  point of view, the thought that came into my mind, I think I tweeted about this yesterday,
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:09.920]  was it feels like Apple finally made a Mac with as much care put into the hardware design as they
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:16.640]  put into the hardware design of iPhones and iPads. Like it feels like a really, really nice
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:21.040]  piece of hardware. And it has, it's been a long time since I felt that way. As much as I loved
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:27.360]  all the MacBooks I've had in the past, you know, 10 years, it's been a long time since something
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:33.600]  blew my mind. And this is kind of blowing my mind. Yeah. Like that they put their a team on it,
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:39.360]  right? Yes, exactly. Right. And I mean, there's just, there's so it's like you said earlier,
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:43.280]  like, you're not the kind of person who wouldn't complain about something. If you did have a
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:48.720]  complaint, I as you know, I'm not the kind of person who wouldn't complain. We are just a
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:56.400]  couple of gripey old men. Yes. That's where the city care fawning over this. Right. I honestly
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:07.600]  honestly don't know what to complain about. Right. It's it and I, I really love and I've had it now
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:15.360]  a little bit longer than you because I got my review unit a week ahead of time, but I love
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:25.840]  the shape of this computer in a way that I haven't loved a MacBook in many, many years. I mean,
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:37.280]  easily 10 years, like, maybe longer it there, there's like a sort of truth to it. It feels
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:49.360]  there, like comparing the old the last generation Intel ones or last year's M1 13 inch MacBook Pro.
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:57.120]  It there's the way that those machines taper off, if you turn them upside down,
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:08.320]  and they taper off at the edges. It's it's not false, but it's also not true, right?
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:19.680]  It it's like the true depth of the machine should be from the middle. And these machines are the
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:29.360]  same thickness from front to back, side to side. And it's, it's very, very pleasant. I
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:35.600]  yeah, there's something like sort of like ineffable about it. It's it's I partly it's
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:39.840]  just because it's smaller to me, but I just enjoy holding it and walking around with it.
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:46.880]  And to have a computer where I feel that way. It's unusual. I have my old Intel MacBook Pro
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:50.880]  still here. I haven't I did the trade in but I haven't sent it in yet. And I'm just touching
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:55.200]  each of them. And I don't think it's my imagination. There's also something like
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:22:00.880]  ever so slightly maybe more slick feeling about the or smooth feeling about the new
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:06.320]  MacBook. I don't know if that's my imagination. Yeah, I don't know. It just feels really nice.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:17.360]  Yeah. And and to have to have all of these, like, hardware, nice feeling, utilitarian, beautiful,
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:27.920]  high resolution, etc, etc, have all these like practical things. On top of just like mind
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:33.840]  blowing Lee high performance. Because I mean, I know people were blown away with the M ones
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:38.560]  that came out last year. And everyone at that time was like, wow, if this is what the M ones
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:42.960]  for quote unquote, consumers is like, what are the pros going to be like, right? And I don't
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:47.840]  think anybody have any of us really knew, but we were hoping for something kind of like this.
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:53.360]  Right. And, and another thought that's been going through my head, as I use this is it's
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:23:00.800]  the first time, probably at least since the Intel Macs came out, that, that I have felt like
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:08.160]  I made a substantial leap in performance from one Mac to the next. And also, that feeling I
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:12.240]  missed this feeling because it used to be the feeling back like, when we were younger, it used
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:18.560]  to be that technology was moving along so fast in terms of performance that you would often have
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:24.240]  the quote unquote, new Mac feeling. And it would be like, wow, everything is so much faster.
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:31.600]  Everything. Everything is faster. And I feel like I have performance headroom that I have not felt
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:38.320]  in at least probably 15 years. And that's a weird feeling. It's a great feeling. I mean,
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:43.760]  part of that is I chose to get, you know, like 64 gigs of RAM. I chose, I made some choices
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:50.720]  that make this even better of a Mac than it could have been. But a lot of it is just the payoff of
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:55.120]  this transition. And I just think that's, it's so inspiring right now as a Mac fan,
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:59.360]  and as a Mac developer, for that matter, you know, to just have this beautiful,
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:04.720]  functional high performance machine that leaves me with so few complaints.
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:12.640]  As a Mac user, and I can only imagine that for you as somebody who's professional apps,
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:23.760]  you know, are primarily on the Mac. As a Mac developer, it is such an assertion of Apple's
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:33.920]  commitment to the Mac as a platform. They use the M1 to make the, if you go to an Apple store
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:41.120]  now and buy an iPad Pro, you get an M1 iPad Pro. And the M1 is both, you know, a very,
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:52.800]  very good and well-received chip for MacBook Airs and consumer grade 13-inch MacBook Pros,
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:25:01.520]  and the Mac mini, and it's in the 24-inch iMac. These are among the best reviewed Macs in memory.
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:13.680]  But they're the same chip that's in the iPad Pro, whereas the M1 Pro and especially the M1 Macs,
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:22.960]  it's like, they don't even make sense for an iPad, right? Like, the differences between the
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:31.360]  regular M1 and the chips in the new MacBook Pros don't even make sense for an iPad. And to
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:40.960]  me, that is proof that everything Apple has said over the last five, six years of people doubting
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:50.080]  whether Apple is committed to the Mac going forward. Like, most famously, two, three years ago
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:59.920]  during the WWDC keynote where Federighi was like, hey, are we moving towards just having
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:11.120]  one operating system and then a big no drop down on a slide, right? To me, this machine is the no,
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:17.280]  right? Like, this is the proof of it. And I also think that in the keynote last week,
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:25.440]  the whole John Ternus section was sort of emphasis on that, you know, about airflow,
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:34.400]  and that they're sweating these details that they wouldn't have to sweat. And they
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:38.080]  didn't have to do any of this, right? They could have just stayed on Intel.
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:43.840]  Well, yeah. And for that matter, they could have just kept the same hardware design,
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:52.400]  the same USB-C port and nothing else. I had the same reaction that you're talking about.
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:27:00.000]  And in fact, on my podcast with Manton Reese, I summed it up like they've been saying for years
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:07.040]  that they love the Mac. And this shows that they really do love the Mac. I think the way I summed
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:15.040]  it up was you can't be a company that makes this computer without genuinely loving the Mac.
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:24.880]  And it's really great to hear because I think you and I share a sort of like basic trust
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:29.600]  of Apple meeting what they say. And so when they say we love the Mac, I don't doubt it,
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:37.200]  but you kind of still want to see the proof. Trust but verify. And this is the verify for sure.
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:42.640]  Right. It really is. Is there anything else that jumps out to you before we wrap up?
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:55.200]  I mean, to me, the curious thing about it and my son has said the same thing. We got him a 13-inch
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:28:05.520]  M1 MacBook Pro last year. And side by side, one in one hand, one in the other. It is technically,
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:12.960]  it is officially, the 14-inch MacBook Pro new one is a half a pound heavier. But he said, it's
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:19.760]  weird. I think this one feels lighter. And I was like, that's so interesting because I've been
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:25.920]  thinking the same thing. Even though I know it's a half pound heavier, it somehow feels lighter.
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:36.480]  And I think it's because there's more air inside that the reason they made it thicker side to side
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:41.840]  isn't because they filled it with stuff like battery, right?
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:43.120]  They filled it with helium.
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:50.480]  No, they filled it with, they gave it more air. And I went back and watched and that John Ternus
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:29:00.800]  section of the keynote, it slid past me watching it live. But in hindsight, it was a major point to
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:07.760]  me was that he emphasized that they, he said, blah, blah, blah, blah, 50% more air. And that's
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:14.880]  all I heard. And I thought, oh, that just means that it's got a more serious fan cooling system.
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:24.400]  But you go back and what he says is that it circulates 50% more air while running the fans
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:34.640]  at a slower speed than last year's 13-inch MacBook Pro with the M1. And part of that could be that,
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:45.040]  you know, it probably is that it is a smarter fan system. But I also think that it's just more airy
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:46.800]  inside. I don't know.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:52.160]  I don't know. Yeah, I don't know what the scientific impact of airiness is.
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:52.640]  Right.
[01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:58.800]  But I don't particularly feel like it's lighter. But I didn't have a lot of time with,
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:07.200]  my son has the M1 MacBook 13-inch. Is that what you just said that Jonas has too?
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:07.680]  Yeah.
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:13.280]  And I just have, I mean, I haven't used it much, but I just loved it whenever I get a chance to
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:19.760]  play around with it. It was evident to me this was a good line of computers. The thing,
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:24.800]  since you asked, if anything else comes to mind before we wrap up, the other sort of like,
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:32.800]  just like appreciative customer slash developer feeling I have lately is repeatedly being sort
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:41.200]  of surprised how everything just works on this thing. And it's not new to the M1 Max and Pro
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:45.840]  necessarily. Like a lot of it is just like, wow, Rosetta 2 really works.
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:46.320]  Yeah.
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:52.000]  I'm looking at my processes list now with activity monitor. And actually another
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:31:00.480]  angle of this sort of satisfaction is just how few quote-unquote Intel processes, not quote-unquote,
[01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:07.520]  I mean, literally Intel processes, quote-unquote Intel. But I have very few Intel processes
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:14.400]  running on my Mac. And that's a testament to all the third parties adapting and the developer
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:21.280]  tools being so capable of making this transition. The previous transition from PowerPC to the
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:27.520]  Intel was a lot more complicated for developers. But I'm sitting here looking, talking to you while
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:35.200]  I scroll through a list of hundreds of processes, several, at least 10 or 15 represent third party
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:42.240]  apps, and then just a couple Intel. And everything just works in part because of those third parties
[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:46.880]  porting, but also because when I do have something that's Intel, it's really true. I don't notice.
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:49.360]  It's just, eh, Rosetta takes care of it.
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:49.860]  Yeah.
[01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:56.040]  Um, I also want to just throw out, like, I think, uh, you know, a lot of developers,
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:32:02.920]  especially web developers are really, uh, heavy into the, the Docker utility. And I've been into
[01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:08.120]  this just as like, to the extent that I dip my toes into web stuff, I've been getting into Docker
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:12.280]  and I'm really impressed. It was one of the concerns I had when, um, and I think a lot of
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:17.240]  web developers were concerned, like what's going to happen to my Intel based server development
[01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:23.880]  stuff. And as file that under, it just works as far as I can tell, it just works. Um, another
[01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:29.000]  magical thing that just that the continuity here, I keep trying things and then thinking,
[01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:35.240]  you know, uh, I'm recording this with, like I said, with my, uh, road podcaster plugged in USB
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:41.640]  through that, you know, amazing complex wiring. And then also audio hijack is running and it's
[01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:45.720]  recording it and everything just works. And I couldn't be happier from the point of view
[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:51.720]  of a user, especially that I had made this transition from one architecture to a completely
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:33:00.920]  different one. And so much stuff just behaves. Don't you, I think that my, my gut fear about
[01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:08.920]  that whole angle was that for years, I I've foreseen that Apple is going to move off Intel
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:15.880]  to their own Silicon, right? Because once, once the, even just, if you just look at a basic
[01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:21.800]  benchmark, like geek bench and, and when we started getting to the point where
[01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:29.480]  iPhones were getting higher scores for single core, uh, benchmarks, then Mac book pros,
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:34.200]  you're like, well, this is ridiculous. You know, like when they were getting close, it,
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:40.200]  it seemed like, Hey, this seems like a direction Apple's going to go. When, when the iPhone
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:46.840]  started getting higher scores, you're like, well, how can they not go this way? But the fear was
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:58.760]  that by moving to their own Silicon, the Apple was going to, uh, kneecap the Mac, right? That,
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:05.000]  that, that it was going to be like, well, okay, you can run the Mac, but it's going to be just on
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:14.520]  a, on a, on a very limited platform. You know, it'll be faster, but yet more limited. And in,
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:21.480]  in fact, it is actually less limited, right? That they've actually gone back and re added,
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:30.840]  you know, HDMI and SD card and mag safe. And it truly is a Mac. There's nothing about it that
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:38.280]  feels limited or hamstrung by the fact that it's based on the Silicon platform that started with
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:43.800]  the iPhone. Right. I think a lot of people have focused on the whole, like, well, you can't run
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:49.880]  windows anymore. You can't do bootcamp. And I think the significance and the importance of that,
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:54.520]  of those features of the compatibility, the ability to run windows in a VM ability to
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:59.320]  boot into windows was so big back at the Intel transition time, it was like a huge advantage of
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:05.240]  the transition. And increasingly we're just in a world where running windows and running Intel
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:11.400]  binaries in general is not, I don't think it's as important as it used to be. Uh, this is in part
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:17.880]  because of the predominance of web apps, you know, which is kind of a existential threat in some ways
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:25.320]  to both windows and the Mac, but, um, to separate topic new, we need a new show for that. Okay.
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:30.440]  That's fine. Yeah. But just to say like, but yes, I totally get that. I think we're sort of like,
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:36.760]  we're sort of like in a historically anomalous period of time where people think they want to
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:43.000]  run Intel stuff, right. But just like give it a few years and we might be like, it might turn out
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  in fact to be that being on an ARM computer is the most, you know, is the most compatible scenario
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:59.080]  to be on. Well, you mentioned Docker specifically and, and that is it, it, it based honestly based,
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:05.960]  it's based on your effusiveness over it. I'm like, Hey, I should, I should look at this.
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:13.400]  Yeah. You and, uh, John Sir, Cusa are both, uh, into it. And, you know, I have, I have been sort
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:21.160]  of touting it lately. It's true. Yeah. But to broaden the scope, just a one notch, it, well,
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:28.840]  no pun intended. One notch would be to just say stuff you do in terminal, right? Like if you,
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:37.640]  if you're typing it in the terminal app, um, that was exactly the area where, where I would say we
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:45.480]  were like, uh, okay, I'm sure Apple's going in, in their own Silicon direction, but is that going to
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:51.080]  mean like, are they going to ship max without the terminal app? Like that was act that felt like it
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:57.000]  was on the table that there might be a version that they would say, here's the, the, the latest
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:05.400]  and greatest Mac. And it's based on Apple Silicon. And it, this version of macOS no longer has
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:11.160]  terminal that felt like it was on the table. And it, in fact, they've gone the other way
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:18.840]  where it, not only is terminal still there, but you can literally run Intel binary stuff
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:25.080]  in the terminal. And it's so fast. You never notice. Like there's like no penalty at all.
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:32.920]  It actually is faster than running it on an Intel Mac, which is bananas, right? That's totally
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:39.960]  bananas. And it's so unlike the, the, the previous transitions like power PC to Intel
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:50.040]  and to really date ourselves the 68 K to power PC where it was like there, there, there were apps
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:57.960]  that ran great under emulation under the original, what they called Rosetta. When you ran power PC
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:03.240]  apps on Intel, there were apps that ran great, but you would never, ever argue that any of them
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:12.120]  ran faster on, on, on the new, the new one than the old one. It was like, it was like, no, this
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:17.080]  is, it just is great though. You know, like Microsoft office hasn't been updated yet, but it
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:25.320]  still, it runs just fine. You know, it's bananas that you can run stuff in the, like the terminal
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:31.240]  and where you're really are measuring it because you're a developer and, and you want this stuff
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:36.120]  to run fast and you're, you're, you actually know how to benchmark it, blah, blah, blah.
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:44.120]  It's bananas that it runs faster, even though it's, it's still an Intel binary. It's crazy.
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:47.400]  And, and just to put it into perspective, the Docker stuff I've learned as I've dug
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:52.280]  into the technical technological side of it, it's literally running a Linux VM
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:39:04.760]  in Intel. I think, you know, through Rosetta, the VM then runs your Intel operating system stuff
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:10.520]  from Docker and it's all really fast. It's great. It's just like, it's the most adaptable computer
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:16.520]  I've ever owned. And I still haven't even dug into the whole fact that you can download and run
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:21.560]  certain iOS apps on it. You know, I haven't even gotten there and it's like, this thing's amazing.
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:28.600]  Uh, one last thing before we go and, and it's the silliest thing, but I'm curious if you have
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:36.200]  thoughts on it is, and I didn't mention it in my review, but I honestly think, and, and as the week
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:44.200]  has gone on since publishing my review, I think that this is not just the best hinge Apple has
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:52.280]  ever made, but I, it's amazingly nice, right? Like when, when you open and close the Mac,
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:58.200]  do you feel that it has a nicer hinge? I didn't notice it. So now I'm sitting here like playing
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:03.400]  with, I didn't notice it. I didn't notice it in a good way, but I didn't notice it in a bad way,
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:07.640]  which is also good. And I'm going to close it at the risk of this is, this is where I would
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:12.280]  normally say like, okay, my connection might go away, but you know, it seems to work out. It is
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:19.000]  nice. Um, it's just one more really fine detail of an altogether great piece of hardware.
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:25.640]  Uh, I'm a positive person now, John, I don't know if you noticed, but I am now,
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:35.480]  um, no longer a cranky curmudgeonly old man. I'm one of these youthful, uh, hello fellow kids.
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:40.600]  Rejuvenated because of the rejuvenated Mac platform.
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:46.200]  Yeah. I'm Steve Buscemi with a skateboard and I'm just skateboarding through the halls of youth
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:51.480]  here. Let's, uh, let's talk about what, what, what can we promote from you? So you mentioned
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:57.320]  your podcast with Manton Reese. That's core intuition, which is a great podcast. One of
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:02.760]  the very, and I, I, I'm not just, uh, saying it because you're on the show. I, it's one of my
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:08.200]  favorite podcasts. Core intuition is your podcast with Manton Reese, uh, Manton. He's okay. I mean,
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:15.560]  he's all right. Manton's great. Manton and I have been doing core intuition for 13 years. Um, and
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:20.200]  yeah, if folks are interested, that's a great, uh, thing, great, great way to check out some of
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:27.000]  my other opinions, Manton's opinions. We're at coreint.org. I am on Twitter, Daniel Punk ass.
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:31.480]  It's funny. We just chatted. We, we just jumped into the, yeah, it's my, it's my professional
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:37.400]  name. I have a much more, um, I have a much more, uh, unrestrained Twitter for my silly
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:42.360]  loosey goosey stuff. Um, we, we finally, we just started talking. We didn't talk about any of this
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:47.560]  stuff I do, but, um, folks who've heard me on the show before know that I am a Mac developer.
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:52.920]  My main app for the Mac is Mars edit, which is a blog editor. You should check it out and you can
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:58.760]  find out all about my work stuff at red sweater.com, which is so fun for me to say now,
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:05.400]  because within the past year, after 20 years, I got, I used to be red dash sweater, which is
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:09.640]  actually not true. It's like red hyphen sweater. And I'm like, you know, you know what I mean?
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:14.520]  Type it in. And now after like 20 years, the last year I managed to acquire red sweater with no
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:19.560]  dash. So red sweater.com, check it out for all your Mac software needs. You don't need to type
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:24.840]  any punctuation characters at all. Just red sweater.com. You know, you know,
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:30.760]  Will Shipley of delicious monster. He was like my, my, my cohort in anguish of having a dash
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:35.800]  in the name as a delicious dash monster. And I think he finally got so English by it. He
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:42.360]  quit and went to work for Apple. So it was the dash that your only choice was to either
[01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:47.720]  buy the domain name without the dash or go to work for Apple. That's there's,
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:51.640]  Those are the two choices. And luckily I got the, uh, the domain, so I don't have to
[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:56.920]  go back to Apple. That would be horrible. Uh, the other, but the other apps people should know
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:05.480]  about black ink is your crossword, uh, puzzle app, which is fantastic and makes me angry every time I
[01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:13.880]  open it because I'm, I'm very good at small crosswords and very bad at large ones. It makes
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:22.280]  me very angry. And of course, um, uh, fast scripts, right? Fast script, which is, and to bring the
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:27.880]  show full circle is a, uh, status menu, status menu item. Yeah. And that's funny. I'm clicking
[01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:34.360]  on it right now in my menu. Um, it's w I'm on the show with you at a horrible time for self
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:41.800]  promotion in a way, because like I'm on the verge of releasing a new fast scripts, 3.0 update black
[01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:47.960]  ink. I have like an iOS version in the works that I'm trying to get finished. So, you know,
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:51.560]  this is one of those like, Hey everybody, check out this great stuff. I'm about to do
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:44:03.320]  it. People can check it out anyway. Thank you so much. This has absolutely been, uh, fun to do.
